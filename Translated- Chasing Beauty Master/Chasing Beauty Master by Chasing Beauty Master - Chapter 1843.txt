“Then why do you still brave the wind and sun to perform acrobatics? Wouldn’t it be better for you both to live a peaceful life with silver in hand?” Guan Yu grew even more curious.

“You don’t understand. Grandfather is someone who can’t sit idle. Performing acrobatics is his lifelong passion. He does it purely out of love, not for money. He simply can’t stay still. We shouldn’t meddle in their affairs—as long as they’re safe and healthy, that’s enough,” Qiqi explained.

Guan Yu finally understood. Many elders preferred staying active, which was indeed beneficial for their health.

He then asked, “Xiaorong, hasn’t the Demon Soul Sect sent anyone yet? I haven’t heard any news.”

“They’ve already come. Left Envoy Brother arrived with us yesterday. But… I don’t want you to clash directly with the sect,” Wang Xiaorong said worriedly.

Given their opposing alignments—righteous versus demonic—the Demon Lord had issued a strict order: if the Eight-Sided Drum Technique appeared, they must seize it at all costs. Conflict was inevitable.

Xiaorong had rushed here to stay by Guan Yu’s side, hoping to mediate if tensions arose. She knew Guan Yu possessed the Eight-Sided Drum Technique within the Emperor’s Seal, crucial for breaking the seal in his mind. Torn between the Demon Lord and Guan Yu, she often sided with the latter to protect him from harm.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Once the Demon Soul Sect arrives, the capital will soon become lively.”

“What ‘lively’? Your goals align, and the sect isn’t composed of demons. Would they dare cause trouble under the Emperor’s nose? Even if they wanted to act recklessly, they’d have to consider the imperial court’s stance,” Xiaorong retorted.

“Since when does the Demon Soul Sect care about such things?” Guan Yu laughed. “In Miao City, Right Envoy treated me harshly. If I hadn’t been quick-witted, she might have killed me.”

“Impossible!” Xiaorong exclaimed, surprised and skeptical—a first. Having grown up under Right Envoy’s care, she knew her well.

Guan Yu had exaggerated. “Aunt Right Envoy is cold on the outside but kindhearted. She knows of our relationship and would never harm you,” Xiaorong insisted.

“Perhaps I overthink. But in Miao City, I witnessed her power firsthand—she alone repelled dozens of Red Lotus Sect elders led by their Grand Elder. Fearsome,” Guan Yu remarked.

Xiaorong sighed. “Aunt Right Envoy was even stronger before a failed romance caused her qi deviation, nearly destroying her cultivation. My father saved her life. Heartbroken, she rebuilt her strength through decades of bitter training. Her current prowess stems from resilience.”

Guan Yu nodded. Right Envoy’s unyielding spirit—rare even among men—had carried her through immense suffering. Her icy exterior masked old wounds.

***

A woman’s fortitude often springs from hatred or love. With the Demon Lord’s guidance, Right Envoy had risen to prominence, her reputation deterring most from crossing her. The Demon Soul Sect’s Left and Right Envoys were legendary figures, the Demon Lord’s trusted arms. While not bound by blood toxins, their loyalty was absolute—Right Envoy’s from gratitude, Left Envoy’s reasons unknown to Guan Yu.

Thanks to Xiaorong, the envoys occasionally aided Guan Yu. Without her, securing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique would have been impossible. Against both envoys, Guan Yu stood no chance, though he might escape one.

Qiqi interjected, “Left Envoy Brother is kind. He always looked after me and Sister Xiaorong in the sect.”

“Of course—you bask in Xiaorong’s glory as the sect’s young mistress. No one dares offend her,” Guan Yu teased. Meeting Qiqi had been unexpected. Though now his disciple, their relationship felt improper, yet he saw no better path. Initially, he’d merely wished to help her and her grandparents.

Qiqi pouted. “I can’t compare to Sister Xiaorong’s status. How enviable.”

“Father adores you like a daughter,” Xiaorong said. “But you must only be known as Guan Yu’s sister—never reveal your true bond.”

Guan Yu brightened. Previously troubled by gossip over Qiqi’s young age and their master-disciple ties, he now saw a solution: presenting her as his sister would shield them both from ridicule, preserving his reputation and her dignity.

“Exactly. Our relationship must stay hidden from the Demon Lord,” Guan Yu agreed.

“Why?” Qiqi asked.

“The Demon Lord already disapproves of Xiaorong and me. Learning of you would worsen matters. He’d never tolerate my ‘philandering’ before marriage,” Guan Yu explained.

Xiaorong nodded. “Father’s pride won’t endure sharing. If he knew, he’d forbid me from seeing Guan Yu.”

“Remember—in the capital, I’m called Wan Hong,” Guan Yu reminded.

“Understood, Young Master Wan Hong,” both girls chorused.

Guan Yu proposed, “To outsiders, Qiqi will be my sister. Agreed?”

Xiaorong stayed silent, leaving the choice to Qiqi, whom Guan Yu cherished for her talent and maturity.

“I’d love to be Young Master Wan Hong’s sister!” Qiqi beamed.

Approaching Wan Yang Inn, they spotted Miss Jiang’s carriage. She tenderly helped Chu Fan alight, his foot severely fractured. Though Guan Yu could heal him with qi or spiritual energy, Chu Fan refused, fearing hidden consequences. As an actor, he insisted on natural recovery.

Entering the lavish inn, Qiqi gasped, “How extravagant!”

A waiter scurried over, bowing deeply to Miss Jiang. She requested a private room, but Xiaorong suggested staying in the bustling hall to enjoy snacks and ambiance.

Noticing the absent aged Daughter Red wine, Guan Yu ordered two jars. Seated beside Chu Fan, he watched Xiaorong and Qiqi explore delicacies.

Chu Fan sighed, “I envy you, Wan Hong.”

“My wealth? Or my ‘two wives’?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Qiqi’s my sister. You’re the enviable one—Miss Jiang, the realm’s finest lady, adores you.”

“She’s peerless, while I’m a mere actor. I fear I’ll ruin her,” Chu Fan murmured.

“Nonsense. Her devotion proves your worth. Ignore others’ scorn,” Guan Yu urged.

Chu Fan nodded, resolved to prove himself worthy. Nearby, Miss Jiang’s gentle care for him contrasted her noble upbringing, revealing her true heart.

As Mei-jie approached with wine, Guan Yu recalled his prior visit with Jiang Yuan Kai. His status here had clearly risen.
