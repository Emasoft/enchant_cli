Guan Yu nodded. “Very well. It’s commendable you’ve considered this. I’ll infuse some spiritual energy into your body first. This place is bitterly cold, and I don’t want you getting frostbitten if I’m distracted during battle.”

Jones shook his head. “No, I’m not cold at all. Since arriving in the Arctic, I’ve never once felt cold.”

Never felt cold? Guan Yu suddenly recalled how Jones had been waiting outside the camp when he and Xue Jing departed. Though Jones wore padded clothing, his layers were even thinner than the guardians’ attire. Yet amidst the subzero tundra, not a trace of frostbite marred his skin.

A golden light shot from Guan Yu’s hand and settled upon Jones. To his astonishment, Guan Yu discovered Jones possessed a Supreme Fire Attribute physique—a rarity he’d only encountered twice before: first in Xue Jing, then in Yingzi. He’d assumed all Supreme Attribute physiques belonged to women. Jones shattered that assumption entirely.

As the golden light enveloped him, Jones felt warmth flood his body. Noticing Guan Yu’s startled expression, he asked nervously, “Mr. Guan Yu? Is there... something wrong with my body?”

“No, no!” Guan Yu waved dismissively. “Your physique is extraordinary—a Supreme Fire Attribute, just like Jingjing’s.”

Having previously explained Supreme Attributes to Xue Jing, she now brightened at the news. “Husband! Since I’m the first Supreme Attribute you found, that makes me the senior disciple! Does this mean Jones becomes my junior brother now?”

Guan Yu flicked her forehead lightly. “Always vying for status. You’re the youngest among us all.”

Pouting, Xue Jing fell silent as Guan Yu channeled a crimson aura into Jones. The fair-skinned man’s face flushed scarlet—resembling either a drunken reveler or the legendary red-faced Guan Gong. With a roar, flames erupted from his palms, melting a ten-meter trench through the snowdrifts.

“That’s incredible!” Xue Jing, a Water Attribute herself, gaped at the fiery display. “Husband, will I get dried up by this?”

Chapter 1756: Taking a Disciple

Xue Jing watched Jones—who’d just gained spiritual energy—unleash flames surpassing any flamethrower. As a Water Attribute akin to the surrounding ice, she feared becoming desiccated by accident. The five polar bear cubs, native to this frozen realm, yelped like frightened pups and scrambled into Xue Jing’s arms at the sudden heat.

Perhaps due to elemental affinity, Xue Jing adored these snowy creatures. Cradling them protectively, she complained, “They used to be so fierce! Why are they such cowards now?”

Guan Yu’s chest tightened watching the cubs nuzzle Xue Jing. Though he resisted her romantic advances due to her youth, he’d long regarded her as his own. Seeing these bears claim what should be his embrace—or his future children’s—made him itch to toss them aside.

Jones, finally regaining composure, prostrated himself on the ice. Three resounding kowtows echoed. “Master, thank you. I’ll follow you for life.”

An uncanny sensation gripped Guan Yu—as if invisible threads wove these events. Since the Fantian Pearl’s emergence, three Supreme Attributes had crossed his path: Xue Jing, Yingzi, and now Jones. Each meeting felt serendipitous yet inevitable. Moreover, instant kinship bloomed with them all—as though reuniting with lifelong companions.

Supreme Attributes were mythically rare. Multiple bearers of distinct elements appearing in rapid succession? Unprecedented. Did connections exist between the ancient copper coin, the Demon Tower, and the Fantian Pearl? The implications staggered—if these were orchestrated, the architect’s prowess defied comprehension.

More crucially, all pointed to Earth’s fate. The Fantian Pearl’s aged voice warned of impending catastrophe, solvable only by gathering Five Polar Origins. Yet Guan Yu couldn’t verify this—what if extracting the Origins triggered disaster? Conversely, ignoring it risked invasion by extradimensional horrors from the Demon Tower.

Earth’s defenses were laughable. Though Guan Yu stood peerless—surpassing even fellow Demon Tower survivors like Ivanov and Ito—he paled against those abyssal entities. His best hope: seal the interworld passages. Could collecting Five Polar Origins achieve this? Uncertain, he could only proceed step by step.

Resolve crystallized as Jones kowtowed. Guan Yu would cultivate allies capable of confronting otherworldly threats—Jones and Hayakawa Shigeru marked his first recruits. Old comrades like Huang Bin, though loyal, remained ordinary humans unfit for this new war.

Life’s path diverged. Bonds endured, but destinations differed.

Accepting Jones’s obeisance, Guan Yu declared, “From this moment, you walk beside me. You’re now an initiate cultivator. Unlike Variants—who enhance singular aspects—we seek holistic refinement: body, spirit, consciousness. Once vengeance is yours, join me in safeguarding this world.”

A golden light pierced Jones’s mind—spiritual cultivation methods and knowledge of Demon Towers and Polar Origins. As a Supreme Fire Attribute, Jones’s fate intertwined with the Fantian Pearl’s prophecy.

Overwhelmed by sudden enlightenment, Jones stood transfixed. Xue Jing bounded over, patting his shoulder. “Listen well, little Jones! You’re now hubby’s third disciple. I’m first, so call me Senior Sister. Wait—no! Call me Shīmǔ (Master’s Wife)!”

Chapter 1757: Ice Colossi

Jones blinked in confusion. “Um... Senior Sister? Shīmǔ?”

Guan Yu sighed. This impish girl, barely grown, constantly sought seniority.

Xue Jing scratched her head. “But I want my own junior! Fine—call me Senior Sister, but remember I’m also Master’s wife. Anyway, you’re my underling now!” Her circular logic tangled itself, ending with a stomp. “Argh! Just do it!”

Guan Yu winced. In her telling, he’d become some lecherous master seducing disciples.

The bears’ behavior suggested more of their kind lurked below. Fearing Jones’s vulnerability, Guan Yu had fortified him with spiritual energy. Earlier, the cubs displayed power surpassing ordinary Variants. After hiding Xue Jing and Jones in an ice crevice, Guan Yu descended into the glacial abyss.

From above, the ice cave appeared modest. Inside, it yawned thirty meters wide, its bottom invisible. Guan Yu extended his spiritual sense—normally spanning fifty kilometers—yet found no terminus. How could an Arctic ice shaft plunge kilometers deep? Polar ice rarely exceeded meters, atop seawater. This anomalous structure hinted at connections to the Northern Polar Origin.

As Guan Yu slowed his descent, spiritual senses probed surrounding ice—nothing but frozen water in all directions. No life. No anomalies. Just endless blue-white.

Suddenly, primal instinct screamed danger. Before conscious thought, golden energy flared around him. Twin palm strikes met crushing force from all sides—as if oceanic depths compacted his body. His shield shattered instantly. Hands struck stone-like hardness, yet no enemy cried out.

Vision cleared to reveal six three-zhang-tall ice colossi—translucent, seamless with their frozen environment. No wonder his senses failed: these golems were extensions of the glacier itself.

Even as Guan Yu analyzed them, four new colossi materialized from walls. Eight icy titans converged. Guan Yu teleported downward—only to find eight more awaiting him below. Gravity manipulation slammed them downward, but replacements kept emerging from every surface.

This wasn’t Earthly warfare—it felt like Demon Tower’s surreal battles. These near-Saint realm ice automatons, heedless of pain, kept attacking. Guan Yu realized—too late—he’d triggered some ancient defensive array.

Chapter 1758: Polar Ice Array

Since returning, Guan Yu’s power dwarfed earthly foes, rendering his Demon Tower-gained abilities obsolete. Yet these colossi and this cavern defied terrestrial logic—they belonged in that otherworldly prison.

Mindless ice golems with near-Saint strength—their sheer relentlessness wore at him. Each step spawned new attackers from glacial walls. After an indeterminate fall, impact tremors signaled the first wave hitting bottom—though his senses still detected infinite depth. An illusionary array, then.

Every movement drew fresh foes. Time distorted—seconds stretched into eternities. Finally, a thunderous crash echoed upwards. The initial colossi had reached solid ground. Yet Guan Yu’s spiritual probe still found no end. Definitely an array formation—but of what nature?
