“Wait a moment. Are you trying to play tricks, kid? I need to tie you both up first to feel at ease. If you attempt anything, I won't hesitate to kill you.” Xiao Hei (Little Black) said coldly. He then produced a long rope from somewhere and approached to bind Guanyu and Xue Jing.

**Chapter 2559: Leading the Way**

“Since when does one of the infamous Ten Great Villains of the martial world fear two people as harmless as us? If this gets out, wouldn’t it tarnish your reputations?” Guanyu remarked leisurely, attempting to provoke them into abandoning the idea of binding.

If forced into restraints, Guanyu would certainly resist—being tied would render them utterly vulnerable.

Upon hearing this, Da Bai (Big White) stopped Xiao Hei. “Let it go. They probably can’t scheme anything. We’ll keep a close watch. If anything seems off, we’ll eliminate them. If we can’t obtain the treasure map, neither will anyone else.”

Xiao Hei nodded. “Fine. Where’s the map hidden?”

Guanyu feigned reluctance. “I hid it underground in a shopping mall west of the city. I can lead you there now. I only ask that you spare us once you have it.”

Da Bai waved dismissively. “Stay cooperative, and we’ll leave you unharmed. I’d prefer this matter resolved peacefully tonight.”

Guanyu nodded in agreement. Taking Xue Jing’s hand, he said, “We’ll lead the way. Follow behind.” He then guided her toward their car.

Da Bai and Xiao Hei didn’t stop them. They weren’t worried about escape attempts—if Guanyu fled tonight, they’d track him down later under far less amicable circumstances.

Guanyu understood this perfectly and had no intention of running. His mind already charted every possible outcome.

“Wait!” Xiao Hei suddenly called out. Guanyu froze, tension rising as he turned. “Something else? Don’t you trust me?”

The twins’ peculiar names—typically given to pet dogs—were their only known identities in the martial world.

Xiao Hei demanded, “Hand over your phones. We won’t risk you calling reinforcements.”

Guanyu exhaled lightly. “Of course. To prove our sincerity, we’ll surrender them temporarily.” He tossed both phones to Xiao Hei, who nodded in approval. “Good. Lead on.”

As Guanyu drove at a leisurely pace, the twins grew impatient in their trailing off-road vehicle. Xiao Hei pulled alongside and shouted through the window, “Speed up! No dawdling!” Guanyu accelerated abruptly, his car shooting forward like an arrow, exhaust sparking in its wake.

Though irritated, the twins could only follow closely. Their vehicle struggled to match the speed until urban traffic forced Guanyu to slow.

Arriving at the West Free Mall, guards promptly opened the electric gate upon recognizing Guanyu’s car. After parking, Guanyu instructed, “Let the off-road vehicle through. They’re friends.”

At this late hour, the closed mall stood empty except for night guards. Though Jones had once proposed 24-hour operations, the plan remained unrealized.

Unbeknownst to Jones, Guanyu’s arrival under duress triggered immediate alerts. Guards notified inner circles of his unexpected visit with “companions.”

By the time Guanyu reached the underground garage, Jones had been informed. Suspicious of the unannounced midnight visit, she ordered Jiang Fenju to mobilize covert forces. “Gather personnel discreetly. Await my signal.”

As the twins followed into the garage, their seasoned instincts detected unease. Yet years of survival hardened them to such tensions. They exited calmly, only to encounter Jones descending via elevator.

Noting Guanyu and Xue Jing’s grave expressions, Jones immediately grasped the situation. Her masked face concealed behind a surgical covering, she coolly addressed Guanyu, “What brings you here at this hour with guests? Couldn’t this wait until morning?”

Though the twins admired her curvaceous silhouette, treasure priorities overrode lust tonight.

Xiao Hei barked, “We’re here, Guanyu! Where’s the map? Final warning—no tricks.”

Jones’s sharp gaze assessed the twins’ formidable cultivation levels. Protecting Guanyu would strain Xue Jing alone, but here, the balance shifted. Tonight spelled the twins’ doom.

Guanyu stated bluntly, “I was kidnapped for the treasure map. They demanded I retrieve it here.” His candor startled the twins, but confidence prevailed—they could handle any opposition.

Jones feigned outrage. “You invade my domain uninvited at midnight? This insolence demands consequences!” Her sudden fury masked strategic theatrics, redirecting the twins’ focus.

Guanyu turned plaintively. “Esteemed ones, I hid the map here, but she denies it. What now?” He then accused Jones, “You promised to safeguard it! Now you renege? Greeding for the treasure yourself?”

Xue Jing chimed in, “We delivered it here ourselves! She’s clearly scheming to claim it!”

Jones retorted, “I’ve never seen any map! You orchestrate this disturbance!”

The twins exchanged glances, uncertain whom to believe. Da Bai growled, “Enough! Where’s the map? Lie again, and we slaughter your woman first!”

Xue Jing interjected rationally, “Consider—we navigated here seamlessly because we’ve been before. Without us, you’d never penetrate this garage.”

The logic swayed them. Xiao Hei whispered, “They couldn’t have entered so smoothly otherwise.”

Da Bai conceded, “We’ll humor you. Where exactly did you hide it?”

Guanyu gestured helplessly at Jones. “She has it. If you want it, extract it from her.”

Jones scoffed, “I know nothing of maps. Leave now, or face consequences!” At her signal, dozens of Free Organization members materialized, encircling Guanyu and Xue Jing protectively.

The twins tensed, realizing their miscalculation. Da Bai declared, “Lady, we meant no offense. We’ll take these two and trouble you no further.”

Jiang Fenju blocked their advance. “Another step, and we strike!”

Within minutes, sixty enforcers surrounded the garage. The twins’ confidence wavered—they’d walked into a trap.

Seizing Guanyu’s subtle nod, Jones blurred forward, her palm striking Da Bai’s chest with devastating force. Though he staggered back, barely containing blood, his reflexes proved formidable.

Xiao Hei whipped out his steel trident as the twins launched a coordinated assault. Even Jones struggled momentarily against their vicious synergy—a testament to their infamy as Ten Great Villains.

**Chapter 2560: No Free Mercy**

The battle raged, steel clashing as the twins pressed their advantage. Yet Guanyu watched calmly—tonight’s ambush left no escape. Every move had been calculated, every reinforcement positioned. The twins’ legendary prowess would meet its end here, in this shadowed garage where arrogance collided with meticulous design.
