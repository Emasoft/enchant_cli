Guan Yu was somewhat disheartened. After so many days without any clues and the constant dangers of this forest where swift beasts could ambush them at any moment, he felt his resolve wavering.

Jin Hua encouraged him, “Don’t lose heart. We still have time. I’m sure we’ll find Uncle Qing.”

Words alone couldn’t change their circumstances. After resting, the pair resumed their journey. Guan Yu couldn’t shake a growing sense of powerlessness.

They ventured deeper into the forest, where towering trees stood so densely that gaps between trunks rarely exceeded two meters. The air felt stifling, oppressively thick, and oxygen grew scarce, making each breath labored.

A foul odor permeated the atmosphere—a mix of stagnant miasma and the rot of long-decayed matter. The toxic fumes irritated their airways; prolonged exposure could prove fatal.

“We can’t stay here. Uncle Qing wouldn’t be in such a place. Let’s keep moving,” Guan Yu urged, gripping Jin Hua’s hand as they flew forward.

He knew the forest held many such treacherous zones, vast and unforgiving, yet abandoning the search was unthinkable.

Their swift pace eventually led them to a lakeside, discovered after following a small stream. The lake, no more than a hundred meters across, shimmered with crystalline clarity.

Here, the air turned fresh and unpolluted. Jin Hua brightened, inhaling deeply before sighing, “Guan Yu, it’s beautiful here.”

“It is,” he agreed, marveling at the oasis amid the tropical wilderness. Even the lakebed’s pebbles were visible through the glassy water.

Yet the serenity felt unnerving. Guan Yu’s instincts prickled with unease as he scanned the idyllic scene.

“It’s so quiet,” Jin Hua remarked, slipping off her shoes to dip her jade-like feet into the water.

Her words struck him. The forest’s heart should teem with life, yet here, an eerie stillness reigned. No beasts roamed—an anomaly.

“You’re right. This silence isn’t natural. Stay alert,” Guan Yu cautioned.

Jin Hua laughed. “After facing so many beasts, you’re paranoid! I feel no danger here.” She continued splashing, her flawless feet glinting like polished stone—a sight that momentarily captivated Guan Yu.

The shoreline bristled with waist-high, leafless grass, uniform and dense.

Ignoring Guan Yu’s warnings, Jin Hua reveled in the lake’s allure. Guan Yu, however, grew suspicious. A lake this pristine yet devoid of fish?

“The water might be poisoned,” he declared, scooping her up to examine her feet.

Blushing, Jin Hua stammered, “Guan Yu! What are you—”

Her skin showed no harm, but a silver needle dipped in the lake turned black. “Toxic,” he confirmed, though the warmth puzzled him—unusual for shaded forest waters.

As they prepared to leave, bubbles erupted at the lake’s center. A colossal, emerald-scaled creature emerged—a towering behemoth with a glowing horn.

**Chapter 3,001: The Unicorn Water Buffalo**

A water projectile blasted from the horn, obliterating a tree trunk. Guan Yu shielded Jin Hua, dodging just in time.

The beast—a Unicorn Water Buffalo—sealed the area with a shimmering dome. Trapped, Guan Yu zigzagged to evade the relentless barrage, Jin Hua clinging to him.

When smoke from her artifact, Xiao Fen, filled the dome, the monster lost sight of them. Yet escape remained impossible—the barrier held firm.

The Unicorn Water Buffalo, a toxic amphibious titan, had claimed this territory long ago, its poison seeping into the waters. Now, it sought fresh prey.

Guan Yu’s muscles burned as he sprinted through cratered terrain, Jin Hua’s arms around his neck. Each near-miss water bomb rattled them, until the creature paused, blinded by smoke.

But the reprieve was brief. The dome remained, and the beast’s patience wouldn’t last. Survival demanded a miracle—or a flaw in the monster’s defenses.
