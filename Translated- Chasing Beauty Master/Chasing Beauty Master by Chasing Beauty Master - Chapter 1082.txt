After searching the bookshelf, Xue Jing found no official seals. The bottom row consisted of cabinets, so she began opening each one. Inside were old calligraphy works by the Fang family patriarch.

When she reached the last cabinet, she discovered a small safe. “Guan Yu, it must be inside here,” she said urgently, “but we don’t know the combination!”

Guan Yu strode over and examined the dark green safe. “It has to be here. There’s nowhere else in this room to hide important items.” He glanced at the small key he’d found under the carpet. Though compact, the safe was no ordinary one—it required a key, a password, and the owner’s fingerprint.

“We’ll need to bring the patriarch here. Otherwise, we’ll never open it,” Guan Yu said, turning to leave. He dragged the bound patriarch from his cell without explanation.

Fang Su, the patriarch’s son, panicked. “Guan Yu! What are you doing? Let him go!” Wei Hongwei swiftly gagged Fang Su with a crumpled hamburger wrapper.

“What do you want? I’ve already given you everything!” the patriarch stammered as Guan Yu hauled him by the collar. Deep down, he knew why—they’d found the safe.

In the study, Guan Yu pressed the key to the patriarch’s face. “Open it.”

The safe contained Mi Mi’s secrets and evidence of the patriarch’s crimes. If revealed, he’d face execution a hundred times over. As he hesitated, Guan Yu pressed a small revolver to his temple. “I don’t need you to open it—just makes things faster. Five seconds.”

The revolver, dubbed the “Lady’s Gun,” was compact, designed for discreet carry. Originally holding six rounds, its modified five-round cylinder packed greater firepower. Popular among Western socialites, it now trembled in the patriarch’s view.

At the count of two, sweat dripped down the patriarch’s face. “I’ll open it! I’ll open it!”

Guan Yu stepped back as the patriarch input the code and pressed his fingerprint. “You enter the details. I’ll turn the key.” Guan Yu wasn’t taking chances—the safe might hold a weapon or destructible evidence.

After several clicks and turns, the door swung open. Inside gleamed twelve zodiac-themed gold bars, nearly two million in cash, three file folders, and a semi-automatic pistol with ammunition.

“Lucky I stopped him,” Guan Yu muttered, securing the gun. A small plastic box held the needed seals. He ordered Jia Bo to pack the gold and cash, warning, “No skimming.”

When Lawyer Liu returned, Guan Yu handed over the seals and files. “These should suffice.”

Lawyer Liu reviewed the documents. “These are transaction records and contracts. But let’s focus on the transfers.” He produced property and stock agreements requiring the Fang family’s signatures and thumbprints.

Guan Yu frowned. “I thought signing was enough. Now banks and factories too?”

“Rushing the stock sale will mean losses,” Lawyer Liu cautioned, but Guan Yu insisted. The lawyer suggested Yao Yu, Lü Mei’s mother, as a buyer.

“Selling to her avoids outsiders, but don’t lowball me,” Guan Yu said. The Fang shares—37% of a meat company and 23% of a cosmetics firm—were valued around three million. Lawyer Liu hinted at two million, but Guan Yu saw through the ploy.

“Three million. Contact Yao Yu.”

As Lawyer Liu feigned hesitation, Guan Yu headed to finalize the Fang patriarch’s coerced signatures, ready to conclude the ruthless transfer of power.

The negotiation dance began—Yao Yu’s potential purchase, Lawyer Liu’s hidden cuts, and Guan Yu’s race to liquidate. Every signature inked brought him closer to dismantling the Fang legacy, one gold bar and bullet at a time.
