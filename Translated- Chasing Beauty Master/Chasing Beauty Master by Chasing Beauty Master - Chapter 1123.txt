“I can’t give it to you, Guan Yu. I absolutely can’t. The money from this deal is already allocated,” Second to Wolf retorted impatiently. “Brother Second, didn’t you understand what I just said? Though Xue Jing already knows about today’s earnings, I still need to plug the one million gap from before. How can I go back and say you took that million? Yingzi would never let you off easily if I did.”

“Enough with the lectures. Just tell me—how much are you giving me today? I don’t care about the rest,” Second to Wolf snapped, clearly displeased with Guan Yu’s evasiveness.

Guan Yu sighed. “Brother Second, the two million I just transferred to Old Wu was borrowed from Yingzi. I have to pay her back. If you won’t return the check, how do you expect me to hand over more cash?”

Second to Wolf eyed him disdainfully. “Have you fallen so low you’re leeching off women now? Is this what you’ve become?”

“What do you think?” Guan Yu shot back. “Every cent I earned earlier went into building the gang. Monthly salaries for Longyuan, expenses—you think this life is easy? Xue Jing had to borrow from her family multiple times before we took down the Fangs. Only now have things slightly improved.”

He spun his tale of financial woe, knowing Second to Wolf couldn’t verify it. The server brought drinks, and Second to Wolf poured himself a glass, silently weighing Guan Yu’s words. The mansion, the women—who’d believe Guan Yu needed loans? Yet the daily costs were staggering. Those women, idle in Qiao Garden, relied on wealthy families. Xue Jing’s repeated borrowing rang true.

Noting Second to Wolf’s softening expression, Guan Yu pressed on: “Brother Second, I’m not feigning poverty. Seizing Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu’s territories required massive funds to rebuild and win loyalty. Burned nightclubs, Sun Xu’s leather factory—all demanded capital. If I were rich, would I scheme for four million? That previous million I gave you—spend it wisely. Less gambling, fewer headaches for Yingzi.”

His mix of truth and lies flowed seamlessly. Second to Wolf suddenly laughed. “Cut the act! You’re chairman of Hua Yu Group! Claiming poverty? Try that on kindergarteners.”

Guan Yu blinked. Hua Yu Group? That was a stretch. “Brother Second, you know I can’t involve Hua Yu. If my sisters found out about these messes, they’d drag me back to corporate hell. Remember Europe? After the human traffickers, I nearly got shackled to a desk. I’d rather die than live like that. I’m not stingy—you’re insatiable. The money I give you could feed fifty men for months. Shouldn’t it go further?”

Though mostly lies, Guan Yu needed to sever Second to Wolf’s cash expectations. Let the super-soldier earn his keep through missions. Yet top-tier assassins like him rarely got hired—why pay billions when Second-Class Esteemed experts cost peanuts? Bill Lynn had hired fifty for mere fifty thousand.

Second to Wolf relented. “Take the check. Give me a million from today’s four, and I’ll never ask again.”

“Impossible,” Guan Yu lied. “The whole Qiao Garden knows about this money. How would I explain a missing million?”

“Say you loaned it out again. Yingzi the miser will hound you for repayments.”

“Exactly! She’d send me collecting debts the moment we need funds.”

Defeated, Second to Wolf changed tack. “Bill Lynn has three treasure maps. Aren’t you worried he’ll find the loot first?”

Guan Yu shrugged. Those maps led nowhere—fake clues pointing to the Feng estate. Let Bill Lynn dig up their gardens. “Let him play with his scraps. We need to anticipate his next move, not chase shadows.”

As they drank, Qi Zhi appeared. “Brother Guan Yu! Fancy meeting here.” Guan Yu introduced Second to Wolf, noting Qi Zhi’s odd accent detection—he’d pinpointed Second to Wolf’s foreign roots despite flawless Mandarin.

“We’re from the same homeland,” Qi Zhi explained. “Your accent mirrors how we all start learning Chinese.”

Second to Wolf marveled, “Two years of study versus your twenty. No wonder I sound rough.”

Qi Zhi smiled. “For two years, you’re exceptional. Mandarin’s the world’s hardest language.”

Guan Yu watched them bond, suspicion gnawing. When Qi Zhi asked about the treasure maps, Guan Yu probed: “The ones from Golden Prosperity Pawnshop’s Boss Wu? Interested?”

Before Qi Zhi could answer, Hou Jinshun arrived with booze. “On the house! But drink light—cops are cracking down.”

As Hou left, Qi Zhi turned to Guan Yu. “Treasure maps? Could Brother Guan Yu be seeking fortune?”

The game deepened.
