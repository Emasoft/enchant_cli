During the previous conflict with the Song family, the main contributors were commanders like Dongfang Mu, Jiang Ziqi, and Wang Dahu, while Guan Yu leisurely strolled around with Tang Xiao. Though his casual comings and goings from Song territory had boosted morale for his faction, his efforts still paled compared to Dongfang Mu's tangible contributions, causing allied families to feel indignant on their behalf.

Yet now, all present were thoroughly convinced of Guan Yu's capabilities.

Strategizing within the tent yet determining victory a thousand miles away!

These eight words perfectly encapsulated Guan Yu's prowess. Were this ancient times, he'd undoubtedly be a marshal-level figure!

Even Dongfang Mu now gazed at Guan Yu with admiration, let alone the awestruck subordinates.

“Guan Yu! If you spare my Song family, I'll agree to any demand!” Song Shaoqin finally bowed his head, knowing Guan Yu had seized his lifeline. The Song clan had utterly fallen into this man's hands.

“I'll show mercy on one condition,” Guan Yu stated coldly. “Swear fealty to me henceforth. Not only will I spare your family, but preserve its foundations.”

Annihilating the Songs brought no benefit – mutual destruction was assured, and the resulting power vacuum would attract unwelcome attention from higher authorities. Keeping them subservient served dual purposes: utilizing their resources while diverting bureaucratic scrutiny. Though initially resolved to destroy them, strategic considerations prevailed.

His ambitions stretched far beyond conquering a single family – Taiwan's Song clan, Hong Kong's Lee family, America's Song branch, even the highest echelons of power awaited challenge. Yet with current limitations, maintaining surface-level antagonism remained prudent.

“You go too far!” Song Shaoqin roared, refusing to become another's lackey.

“Too far?” Guan Yu smirked mirthlessly. “Had I lost today, would you grant me mercy? We both know the answer.”

The defeated man trembled, aware of Guan Yu's truth. Victory would have meant extermination. Yet submission remained intolerable...

Noting his hesitation, Guan Yu lifted a phone. “Shall I announce the Songs' planned escape? First pursuers won't be authorities, but your betrayed allies...”

“Stop!” Song Shaoqin screamed as dialing commenced.

“Decision made?”

“You haven't given me time!”

“Forgotten.” Guan Yu tapped his temple mockingly. “Answer now. I won't permit asset transfers during deliberation.”

“Devil incarnate!” The Song heir gnashed teeth before slumping defeated. “I accept.”

Preservation mattered most – mountains retained could always regrow forests. Temporary humiliation allowed future vengeance.

Yet Guan Yu saw through this instantly. A flicked insect flew into Song's open mouth. “What did you feed me?!”

“Heart-Devouring Worm.”

Jiang Ziqi shuddered at the name, knowing its horrific effects. The perfect control mechanism – he shot Song a pitying glance.

Though ignorant of specifics, Song recognized this was no ordinary parasite. Suppressing fury, he demanded, “May I leave?”

At Guan Yu's nod, he fled Dongfang Manor to seek antidote knowledge.

...

The capital-shaking conflict concluded with Song's submission. Hundreds of families entangled, dozens obliterated. Guan Yu's allies doubled their holdings while Song loyalists suffered catastrophic losses, now clamoring for explanations.

The Songs maintained stoic silence against these accusations.

Entrusting new allies to Dongfang Mu's faction, Guan Yu accompanied Old Master Wen to the cadres' sanatorium. After treating Ye and Shen family patriarchs, he proceeded to cure Old Master Zhou's granddaughter.

Watching Guan Yu's masterful acupuncture, the elders competed for his services. Wen beamed with pride – his grandson-in-law had toppled a dynasty while healing the elite!

Shen grumbled jealously, “Why preen? The boy's skills aren't yours!”

“Can't I enjoy reflected glory?” Wen retorted, humming opera tunes.

These surviving revolutionaries maintained lifelong rivalries through every metric. Now Wen and Liu emerged ultimate victors – “Grandsons should emulate Guan Yu” became their crowning boast.

Ignoring the gloating, Ye inquired, “With Song weakened, what next?”

Recovering from energy-intensive treatments, Guan Yu pondered before answering, “Return to N City soon.”

“Why?” The Wen and Liu patriarchs exchanged startled looks.

Ye nodded sagely. “Indeed, you shouldn't remain capital-bound.”

Wen slammed the table. “What? Would higher-ups move against him?!”

“Temper, old friend,” Zhou chided. “Precisely because peace is fragile, absence becomes wisest.”

Post-conflict unity under Guan Yu's leadership paradoxically threatened authorities more than chaotic balance. While convenient having a figurehead, overwhelming influence risked overshadowing official power. Strategic withdrawal allowed natural discord to resurface.

Moreover, Guan Yu himself desired no crown. With family to protect, he'd avoid Xiang Yu's tragic fate against lurking rivals like the Hu family or ambitious princelings.

“The boy sees clearer than you veterans!” Zhou praised.

Wen harrumphed, “None shall touch him – not even the Politburo!”

“Your military merits still command respect,” Zhou assured. “Besides, we allies remain.”

“Allies?” Wen scoffed. “Vultures circling for advantage! Unprofitable causes find you scarce!”

The elders reddened at this blunt truth.

Morning passed in such banter. Post-lunch, Guan Yu rode with Zhou to a quadrangle near the Forbidden City – a four-courtyard complex worth hundreds of millions, blending artificial hills, ponds, and vermilion pillars under glazed tiles.

“Any available nearby?” Guan Yu asked covetously.

“Difficult,” Zhou replied. “Our street houses old relics. Try the next – celebrity residents, still pricey.”

Disappointed, Guan Yu mused about Wen's rejected government-offered courtyard.

Entering the residence, they encountered Zhou Tianci – the patriarch's son – and a goateed charlatan introduced as Daoist Master Yi.

“This charlatan claims my granddaughter's possessed!” Zhou spat upon hearing the diagnosis.

When the “master” insisted ghosts caused the illness, Guan Yu sprayed tea mid-sip. Security promptly ejected the bellowing fraudster.

The quadrangle's compact layout featured miniature landscapes amidst traditional architecture. Guan Yu's real estate curiosity resurfaced. “Any available units?”

“Want to buy?” Zhou chuckled. “Our street's full of antiques like me. Try the next – though movie stars' homes cost fortunes too.”

Guan Yu sighed. Old Master Wen had once refused a state-offered courtyard – perhaps that could be reclaimed?

Inside, Zhou Tianci greeted them nervously, eyeing Guan Yu skeptically until recognizing the capital's new legend. A pretentious “Daoist Master” then claimed the sick girl was haunted, provoking Guan Yu's suppressed laughter and Zhou's fury.

The imposter's expulsion left Guan Yu facing Zhou Tianci's embarrassed explanation: “Many respected figures recommended him...”

“Respected fools,” Zhou growled before turning apologetic. “Shall we proceed?”
