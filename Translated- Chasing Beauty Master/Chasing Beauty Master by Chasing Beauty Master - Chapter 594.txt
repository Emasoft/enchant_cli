When Guan Yu asked him, Bika Cat replied slowly, “Magic crystals, known as ‘magic cores’ in Moonlight Continent, are powerful crystalline formations within magical beasts. They contain immense and volatile energy. Even a Grand Magus wouldn’t risk absorbing such chaotic energy directly into their body. Though these cores cannot be forcibly assimilated, they remain indispensable aids for mages. Moreover, when refined by powerful magic practitioners, the elemental energies within these cores can fuse with medicinal herbs to create coveted elixirs that enhance one’s abilities. Consequently, their value skyrockets!”

Hearing this, Guan Yu chuckled helplessly in his heart. He couldn’t fathom where Bika Cat found the audacity to openly criticize him—a blatant provocation. His thoughts drifted to the past in the Elven Forest. Had it not been for Bika Cat’s interference, he might have already reached the Grand Magus realm. Now, his regressed cultivation severely hampered his future plans.

“Amy, you mustn’t give up. If you dare abandon your path, I’ll never face you again!” Guan Yu silently vowed, worry gnawing at him. Amy was his closest friend since arriving on Blue Beauty Continent.

When Bika Cat mentioned hunting magical beasts for their cores to earn money, Guan Yu quipped, “Could I take up this trade later to earn extra coin?” Bika Cat chuckled. “Obtaining magic cores is no simple feat. Magical beasts possess formidable strength, and high-tier ones even exhibit cunning intelligence. Their robust physiques, unique combat methods, and ferocious nature make them tougher opponents than humans of equal rank. Moreover, not all beasts harbor cores. Sometimes, mercenary groups suffer heavy casualties slaying a high-tier beast only to find no core. To trade in these crystals, you’ll need exceptional strength.”

Chapter 1506: Elemental Allocation

Guan Yu’s dreams of wealth through magic cores evaporated. As a mere Qi Refining cultivator, even a first-tier beast would obliterate him. Sighing, he heard Bika Cat say, “Now that you’ve gathered the materials, find a secluded spot. I’ll brew the magical bath to temper your body. This will heighten your sensitivity to thunder elements, making them easier to manipulate.”

“Why thunder elements?” Guan Yu asked. “My Sacred Dragon Heart resides within you,” Bika Cat explained. “As I excel in thunder manipulation, this element will maximize your potential.” Moved, Guan Yu bowed. “Thank you, Elder Bika. I’m grateful for your guidance despite our brief acquaintance.”

“You’ve decent manners, brat.” Bika Cat grinned. “Our meeting is fate’s design. Repay me by cultivating diligently.” Guan Yu nodded solemnly. “I won’t fail you.”

Grand Elder Soros, pleased that Guan Yu and Liu Piaopiao had acquainted themselves, whispered to Guan Yu, “Since you know Miss Liu, I’ll spare further introductions. You’ll rely on her often. The crucial challenge trials approach—don’t disappoint me.”

“Thank you for your concern, Grand Elder. I’ll exert my utmost,” Guan Yu replied. Soros departed satisfied, trailed by Liu Piaopiao, who cast a meaningful glance at Guan Yu.

As a seasoned auction house operator, Liu had encountered many prodigies, yet Guan Yu struck her as different—an ineffable quality marking him as extraordinary. His eyes revealed nothing, a dispassion belying his youth.

Chapter 1507: Who Will Answer the Challenge?

Awaiting the trials beneath a tree, Guan Yu watched bustling disciples and sighed. “This challenge tests patience more than magic.” Beside him, Huo Lingling giggled. “Annoyed, Brother Guan? These ancestral rules bind even my father. We must endure.”

Before Guan Yu could nap, he sensed hostile eyes. In a shadowed corner sat Hu Xiaohai, glaring venomously. Guan Yu smirked dismissively, worrying Lingling. Though Guan Yu had recovered strength, facing a genius like Hu remained perilous.

As the challenge ceremony commenced, the arena hushed when Guan Yu’s name echoed. Hundreds stared—skeptical, curious, mocking, expectant. Guan Yu rose calmly. “My turn. I’ll meet your expectations.”

Spectators included outsiders eager to verify rumors of Guan Yu’s meteoric rise from cripple to genius. Walking past scornful gazes, Guan Yu reached the platform where Grand Elder Soros smiled approvingly. Hostile proctor Griffin reluctantly acknowledged Guan Yu’s status as the sect’s top talent.

After ritual formalities, Griffin announced, “Phase One complete. Proceed to Phase Two: Magical Precision Testing.” This elite assessment required initial scores above third-tier. While preliminary tests identified core disciples, precision trials distilled the elite from the exceptional.

Chapter 1508: Genius or Freak?

Murmurs rippled as Griffin handed Guan Yu a black crystal orb. The crowd held its breath. Below, Hu Xiaohai whispered to Wu Yuying, “Did that trash truly reach eighth-tier magic?” Wu nodded grimly. “His transformation defies reason. Avoid provoking him.”

Griffin’s trembling voice shattered the silence. “Guan Yu—ninth-tier magic!” Pandemonium erupted. Ninth-tier—a one-in-ten-thousand prodigy! Observers marveled, foreseeing a future Archmage. Guan Yu bittersweetly recalled his former Archmage prowess, now reduced to being bullied by Senior Mages.

In the crowd, a hidden elder smiled. “This boy surpasses all Jīnzhou City’s talents. Glad I didn’t oppose him like Griffin.” Sect Master Huo Zhengtian accepted Liu Piaopiao’s congratulations, marveling at Guan Yu’s weeklong ascent from pariah to legend.

Wu Yuying glared at Hu Xiaohai. “You said eighth-tier!” Hu seethed, undeterred by warnings. His pride couldn’t tolerate Guan Yu overshadowing him—especially with Huo Lingling’s affections at stake.

As Guan Yu descended, Griffin announced the brutal challenge matches—the true test of combat mastery. The arena tensed. Magic scores meant little without battle prowess. Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. Today, he’d silence every doubter.
