Amidst these major events, a minor piece of news went entirely unnoticed—the White Cloud Temple's third-generation disciple who colluded with demonic sects to frame the sect leader had been exterminated, soul and spirit utterly destroyed. Though unnamed, Ye Xiuyuan, still lodging in the temple's guest quarters, immediately discerned the truth. With a faint sigh, he departed the White Cloud Temple.

Just as the world assumed the matter settled, Guan Yu secretly slipped away from the temple and flew to Ninghai. He needed information—or rather, sought to purchase it. The target was none other than Yin Qianji. How else could he quell the fury burning in his heart without someone paying in blood?

“You want the location of the Thorn Demon Sect's mountain stronghold?” Yin Qianji's eyes flickered with hesitation. This was outright betrayal—of an entire sect, no less. Why would Guan Yu need this? Could it relate to the incident during Wild Crane Daoist's tribulation crossing?

[Chapter 1220: Assault on the Thorn Demon]

“Let's dispense with formalities.” Guan Yu smiled, producing a crystalline object from his hand, its interior shimmering with shifting hues. “Does this warrant the information?”

“Seven-Colored Crystal? Bloody hell! You’d trade this for mere intelligence? Are you mad?” Yin Qianji's demeanor transformed from wary restraint to fawning obsequiousness, as if sprouting a wagging tail.

“You know its purpose better than I. Think I’d hand it over freely? I want the Five Elements Essences. If you have other worthy items, I’ll consider them—provided they meet my needs.” Guan Yu’s lips curled. Betrayal served as the loyalist's epitaph—how fitting for master-subordinate relations.

Demonic sect members without principles were easiest to buy. Guan Yu knew Yin Qianji likely held no allegiance to the Thorn Demon Sect. With sufficient incentive, even Yin Qianji would sell out the Yin Ghost Sect's secrets.

“This artifact aids Golden Core cultivators in forming Nascent Souls—especially crucial for demonic practitioners. I must have it, but its value demands time to gather resources. Three days—my offer will satisfy.” Yin Qianji’s gaze burned as Guan Yu pocketed the crystal. All pretense of restraint vanished before the Seven-Colored Heart’s allure.

“Agreed. But first, the Thorn Demon Sect's location. These intervening days suit my purposes.” Guan Yu’s smile revealed undisguised bloodlust.

“Naturally.” Yin Qianji produced a satellite map via printer, its colored contours making Guan Yu frown. The demonic sects’ reach proved alarming, but irrelevant to his aims.

Two days later, Guan Yu stood dizzy atop a burial mound—the Thorn Demon Sect’s unorthodox portal site.

“Elder Qin, I want none escaping. Can we utilize their defensive array?” Guan Yu rubbed his chin, smile tinged with chilling menace.

“Temporarily. Though weak, don’t underestimate them. The elders and I will handle their leadership. Golden Core cultivators and below are yours.” Qin Wuliang’s expression turned wry. Sect extermination—a rarity since the national wars united righteous and demonic factions against external threats. Post-war skirmishes never escalated... until now. The Thorn Demon Sect had crossed the line by interfering with Wild Crane’s tribulation—a soul-destroying offense.

“Perfect. I’ll vent this stifled rage.” Guan Yu’s pent-up fury from White Cloud Temple needed outlet. The Thorn Demon Sect—architects of this scheme—would bear his wrath.

“Use the Realm-Breaking Talisman. Silent entry, but expect immediate detection. You’ll be on your own then.” Qin Wuliang meticulously planned to minimize casualties.

Guan Yu activated a yellow talisman, melting a portal through space. He flashed through before it sealed—a blink-and-miss maneuver.

“Disgusting.” Whale Third scowled at the miasmic atmosphere within the demonic stronghold. “Defiling spiritual veins with this filth.”

“Begin.” Guan Yu sprinted toward a black mountain, flanked by fleeting crimson and azure shadows as Qin Wuliang vanished silently.

“ENEMY ATTAAAA—” A violet-robed figure’s alarm ended mid-shout as a colossal blue hammer sent him flying like a baseball.

“HA! Worthy prey!” Whale Third’s thunderous voice boomed as twin hammers pummeled a black-robed elder, gale-force winds threatening to sweep the frail form away.

“My turn.” Guan Yu summoned his obsidian Demon-Subduing Staff. Restricting himself to weaker weaponry honed skills—a brutal training method where survival demanded growth.

[Chapter 1221: The Thorn Demon's Lament]

Guan Yu’s lightning-footwork bewildered two Foundation Establishment demons. Staff strikes silenced them mid-sentence. Chaos erupted as his bloodied staff painted carnage—seven kills in thirty-four steps.

“Don’t panic! Mob him!” A black-dagger wielder blocked Guan Yu’s staff, skidding back unharmed before vanishing.

“Demon-Subduing Staff: Chaotic Spring!” Countless staff shadows enveloped Guan Yu as gravity intensified. Clanging metal revealed seventeen attackers materializing—only to be swept aside like chaff.

“Golden Vajra Emerges!” A golden Buddha projection behind Guan Yu flashed, bludgeoning two foes into death throes.

“Divine Ability: Vajra Incarnation!” Eight wrathful Buddha clones slaughtered indiscriminately, leaving three Golden Core initiates as final victims.

“DIIIIE!” Guan Yu’s staff became a black dragon, cleansing the square of hundreds in thirty blood-soaked minutes. Entering the main hall, he frowned at deeper troubles.

“Why slaughter us?!” Trembling Golden Core disciples arrayed defensively—hatred, fear, and confusion warring in their eyes. Demonic cultivation’s ruthless hierarchy bred survivors, not warriors.

“You strike first, yet whine about retaliation? Use your tricks!” Guan Yu stalled to recover energy, regretting premature entry.

“Wild Crane’s disciple? ATTACK!” Seven shadows materialized, poisoned daggers striking vital points.

“Anticipated. Golden Bell!” A resonating bell shield blocked fourteen strikes before shattering.

“Dragon-Subduing Palms: Night Engulfing All Directions!” Shockwaves repelled attackers—except one impaled through the chest by Guan Yu’s fist.

“Scatter!” The leader paled—was this truly a Golden Core mid-stage cultivator? Even Nascent Souls lacked such lethality!

“Leaving?” Guan Yu’s staff danced like calligraphy brushes, weaving thousands of shadows. “Divine Ability: Demon Purge!”

The staff’s tide forced defensive stances. Pressure suddenly lifted from all but one—skewered and flung into comrades. Moments later, eight Golden Cores lay lifeless. Guan Yu panted, exhilarated. Truly, a fine day for killing.

[Chapter 1222: Bountiful Harvest]

Guan Yu plundered the sect’s resources—including several depleted top-grade spirit stones—valuable despite exhausted energy. Seventy-odd artifacts awaited reforging. Sect extermination proved lucrative indeed.

“Unexpected riches. Elder Qin summons you.” Whale Third’s voice interrupted Guan Yu’s inventory.

The demolished hall revealed Qin Wuliang nursing injuries. “My body requires two months’ rest. The elder fought well.”

“My apologies...” Guan Yu’s fevered mind cooled with shame.

Qin smiled. “These demonic soils can restore our mountain. I’ll yield to Vajra’s care after this.”

“What of this stronghold?” Guan Yu scanned the thirty-mile pocket dimension.

“Let Vajra explain. Old friend—time to work.” Qin chuckled at the black staff, anticipation glinting in his eyes.
