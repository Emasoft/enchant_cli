“If you say Guan Yu did not aid the Red Lotus Sect, this Right Envoy is rather relieved,” the Right Envoy remarked. Guan Yu, of course, cared little for such matters. “Aunt Right Envoy,” he said, “you know what kind of person I am. It’s not that I refuse to help the Red Lotus Sect—I simply find them distasteful. What does their survival matter to me? Moreover, when it comes to seizing the Eight-Drum Technique, everyone acts out of self-interest. Even if I did help them, they’d hardly show gratitude.”

“And do you think I care about such things?” Guan Yu sneered. Whether it concerned Xuan Ming or the Red Lotus Sect, he paid no heed to their schemes. His sole purpose here was to claim the Eight-Drum Technique, not to serve Xuan Ming’s agenda.

The Right Envoy smiled faintly, a rare occurrence. “I admire your forthrightness—liking what you like, disliking what you dislike, without hidden motives. Though your ties to our Demon Soul Sect are... complicated, I won’t hold back when the time comes.”

“Earlier, I said I was glad the Young Mistress didn’t accompany you. This is precisely why,” she stated bluntly.

Guan Yu frowned. He had assumed the Right Envoy kept Wang Xiaorong away out of concern for her safety. Now it seemed there were other considerations. Had Xiaorong come, she would have undoubtedly sided with Guan Yu against the Demon Soul Sect during the struggle for the technique, complicating the Right Envoy’s plans. With Xiaorong absent, the Right Envoy could act freely—even if it meant injuring or killing Guan Yu under the Demon Lord’s orders. The Demon Soul Sect had deployed numerous experts for this very purpose. Though formidable, Guan Yu stood little chance against such overwhelming force.

Refusing to yield in demeanor, Guan Yu replied coolly, “Aunt Right Envoy, who will ultimately claim the Eight-Drum Technique remains uncertain. Rest assured, I won’t show any mercy either.”

Tension thickened the air. A single misplaced word could ignite conflict.

**Chapter 4633: Let Him Go**

Though sensing the gravity of the situation, Guan Yu remained unflinching. His opponents had expended much spiritual energy in recent battles—renewed hostilities would disadvantage them. Despite his group numbering only four, the Right Envoy suspected Cloud Azure Sect had more forces lurking. Unlike the Red Lotus contingent led by elders, Cloud Azure might have dispatched a chief. Provoking Guan Yu now risked triggering an ambush. Regaining composure, the Right Envoy inquired, “Guan Yu, have you uncovered any leads about the Eight-Drum Technique in Miao City?”

“A few,” Guan Yu fibbed. “They say Miao City is entirely inhabited by demonic cultivators. Earlier, I encountered a Red Lotus group heading there with over a dozen members, claiming the technique is hidden within.” Truth aside, diverting the Right Envoy’s faction there would eliminate competitors.

“Oh?” The Right Envoy studied him skeptically. “If the technique lies in Miao City, why aren’t you there? What brings you here instead?”

“I went,” Guan Yu lied smoothly, “but Miao City isn’t easily breached. It’s teeming with powerful demonic cultivators. Chief Lu and dozens of our disciples are stationed at the outskirts, awaiting the right moment to strike.” In reality, no Cloud Azure reinforcements existed—but the Right Envoy didn’t know that.

“And why are you here, Aunt Right Envoy?” he countered.

“We materialized at this mountain’s base upon entry. We ascended to survey the area, unaware of Miao City’s presence here.” Whether truthful remained uncertain, but Guan Yu doubted her account. Their luck was infuriating—while his group had trekked arduously, hers had arrived effortlessly.

Gesturing toward the thunderous cascade, Guan Yu added, “We came investigating if this waterfall’s waters are potable.” He approached the cliff’s edge. The earlier fragrant breeze had given way to crisp coolness by the roaring falls.

“Aunt Right Envoy,” he proposed, “why not join forces to storm Miao City? Time dwindles. Together, we might secure the technique. Lingering here wastes precious hours.”

Before she could respond, a subordinate interjected: “Right Envoy, what of this prisoner?”

“Release him. Let him go.” She showed no interest in the Red Lotus disciple’s fate, disinclined to needless slaughter. Guan Yu noted her restraint—unlike the Demon Soul Sect’s notorious reputation, its Left and Right Envoys possessed integrity. The sect’s vileness stemmed from the Demon Lord’s edicts, not inherent evil.

To Guan Yu, so-called righteous sects like Red Lotus and Cloud Azure often proved more hypocritical. They trumpeted good deeds but buried misdoings to preserve reputation. Conversely, demonic sects owned their actions—good or ill. While the Demon Lord sought dominion through ruthless means, orthodox leaders like Xuan Ming cloaked ambitions in respectability. Both sought power but diverged in methods: the Demon Lord embraced overt brutality; Xuan Ming demanded subservience through subtle manipulation.

Thus, Guan Yu mused, true villains often lurked within “righteous” ranks—like Lin Chen and Ling Su, praised as model disciples despite their treachery, or Chief Xiang’s hidden ambitions. Hypocrisy reigned where appearances mattered most.

**Chapter 4634: Close Inspection**

“Why release him? Why not kill him?” Guan Yu challenged.

“Do I strike you as bloodthirsty?” The Right Envoy joined him at the precipice. “Our sect doesn’t revel in slaughter. This injured junior isn’t worth the blade.”

Guan Yu fell silent, studying the colossal waterfall. Its roar drowned normal speech. The cataract plunged from a mountain cleft into a deep pool far below. Midway, an enormous protruding boulder split the torrent, sending spray arcing through mist.

“Such scale is rare,” Guan Yu remarked. “I’ve never witnessed its equal in the jianghu.”

The Right Envoy stared intently at the falls, seemingly oblivious. Softly, she recited: “Upon the Divine Stone Mountain, fragrant winds carry afar, divine techniques shall surely appear.” Louder, she mused: “The ‘golden city below’ has manifested—the desert’s gilded visage. Now within Miao City’s bounds, surrounded by these peaks... But where lies the divine stone?”

Guan Yu added: “‘Fragrant winds’ likely reference the floral mountain behind us. Summer blooms explain the scent. Following the wind’s path led us here—this must be the Divine Stone Mountain.”

“There!” The Right Envoy’s eyes snapped open, pointing to the mid-fall boulder. “That must be it! If we confirm that rock’s uniqueness...”

Guan Yu had already suspected the stone. From their vantage, water-polished surfaces gleamed slick, hinting at jet-black jade beneath. However, the cataract’s veil obscured details. Viewers below might discern it as a massive onyx gemstone, edges moss-carpeted from perpetual moisture.

“You three—descend and search the pool’s depths,” the Right Envoy ordered. Three cultivators leapt into the abyss, slowing their fall with flight techniques. “You two—inspect that rock. The technique may reside nearby.”

The pair maneuvered to the slippery protrusion but struggled against the deluge’s force. One nearly plummeted before recovering with levitation. “Right Envoy,” they reported upon return, “no foothold exists. The current’s too violent.”

Below, the trio stripped to dive. One noticed the strange black stone mid-cascade but dismissed it. Had they recognized it as a colossal spirit-conducting gem—a treasure surpassing even the egg-sized one in Guan Yu’s Fallen Soul Blade—frenzy would’ve ensued. Such a prize rivaled the Eight-Drum Technique itself.

**Chapter 4635: Storming In**

After multiple dives, the exhausted trio resurfaced. The pool’s vastness complicated their search. Guan Yu and the Right Envoy observed impassively. Suddenly, a diver pointed upward, drawing attention to the anomalous stone. To the uninitiated, it meant little. To connoisseurs, its value was incalculable.

Unperturbed, Guan Yu bided his time. Let them exhaust themselves searching. Should they find the technique, he’d simply seize it later. For now, patience reigned.
