Wang Xiaorong knew her opponent merely paid lip service while his heart remained defiant. “You’d best abandon any wicked notions,” she declared. “Let me enlighten you—there exists no true antidote for the Blood Toxin in this jianghu. None, at least not yet. Cease fantasizing about escaping the Mo Hun Sect’s control. Once a pawn of our sect, you remain so until death claims you. While breath still fills your lungs, the mark of Mo Hun shall cling to your soul. Abandon all hope of deliverance.”

Chapter 3598: Unyielding Resentment

Her words dripped venom, grating upon the ears. Yet despite his discomfort, Yan Zhao dared not retort, standing with bowed head in stifled silence. A single misplaced gesture might ignite her wrath anew.

To his surprise, this Young Mistress possessed keen perception. The faintest clench of his fist had betrayed simmering discontent—a testament to her sharp instincts.

Yan Zhao knew well the truth behind Wang Xiaorong’s claim: no cure existed beyond the Mo Hun Sect’s palliative mixtures that merely suppressed the Blood Toxin’s ravages. Still, hope stubbornly clung within him—perhaps fate might yet yield an antidote, or grant him power to concoct the life-prolonging draughts himself. When that day dawned, he would cast off these chains. First to fall would be the Azure Dragon Left Envoy, followed by this venomous wench before him.

Noting his downcast silence, Wang Xiaorong sneered inwardly. Proud yet thick-skinned, this one made fine spy material. “Cease your delusions,” she pressed. “Even should you survive to gain power, what then? The Blood Toxin’s taint brands you demon-kin. Think Yun Qing Sect would embrace such abomination? You’d be caged like a beast. Your sole path lies with Mo Hun. Mark this well.”

“Understood,” Yan Zhao replied evenly, face betraying nothing. “This humble servant knows the price of betrayal. Command me as you will, Young Mistress.”

Yet Wang Xiaorong sensed the murderous hatred coiled within him. Wise enough to bide his time, Yan Zhao calculated coldly—her death on Yun Qing territory would bring the Demon Lord’s fury, exposing his own duplicity. A master of restraint, this thwarted genius might have soared were fate kinder. Now condemned to the demonic path, he acknowledged the cruel truth: even with antidote in hand, Mo Hun’s shadow would pursue him eternally. Betrayal meant exposure, hunted by both sects until no refuge remained in all the jianghu.

“Enough prattle,” Wang Xiaorong dismissed. “I bring tidings for Yun Qing—the Eight-Sided Drum Technique lies in Miao City. Relay this to Xuan Ming: dispatch capable disciples posthaste. Two fox demons aid our sect now. Tarry, and the prize slips forever from your grasp.”

Yan Zhao lifted his head, perplexed. “Young Mistress, why betray Mo Hun’s plans thus?”

“Precisely to warn them!” she laughed. “Let Yun Qing know our advance has begun. Recall their fools—send skilled warriors to make contest sport. Ensure Xuan Ming feels urgency’s bite. Oh, and suggest Guan Yu lead their party.”

Comprehension dawned—this trap targeted Yun Qing’s rising star. Since his arrival, Guan Yu had eclipsed Yan Zhao’s prestige at every turn. Let the desert claim this upstart. “Understood. By your leave, I withdraw.”

As Wang Xiaorong departed, she mused that failure would seal Yan Zhao’s worthless existence. Returning to Mo Hun headquarters, she faced her father’s ire.

“Roaming again?” the Demon Lord thundered. “Guards scoured the sect all day! Must I execute another for hiding your escapades?”

Wang Xiaorong pouted. “Must you fuss? I merely sought to join the desert expedition but lost their trail.”

“Madness!” he roared. “That wasteland offers naught but death! Yun Qing’s dogs swarm there already—you’d walk into their jaws?”

“Danger?” She tossed her head. “Empty threats to cage me! Guan Yu goes—I shall follow!”

At this name, the Demon Lord’s fury redoubled. “This Guan Yu consumes your thoughts! I’ll see this Yun Qing whelp’s mettle myself!”

“Harm him and you make widow of your daughter!” The reckless words escaped before she could check them.

Chapter 3599: Elopement

Silence hung heavy. The Demon Lord paled. “Explain.”

“I’ve given myself to him,” Wang Xiaorong confessed boldly. “Your future son-in-law—a dual-cultivation prodigy. Slay him, and your heir wears mourning robes!”

The Demon Lord slumped into his throne, murmuring darkly. At length, he sighed. “So be it. Let this Guan Yu present himself. Should he slight you...” A murderous glint completed the threat.

Yet inwardly, the Demon Lord appraised this unforeseen match. Guan Yu’s talents were undeniable—those rare artifacts he bore marked him as no common disciple. If turned to Mo Hun’s cause... “Arrange our meeting,” he commanded. “This union demands reckoning.”

Chapter 3600: Negotiations (Part 1)

Meanwhile in Yun Qing’s Tiger Peak Hall, Yan Zhao addressed Sect Leader Xuan Ming. “The fox demons grant Mo Hun advantage in tracking Miao City. We must act swiftly.”

Elder Lu nodded gravely. “Dispatch trackers to shadow their movements. When they near the prize, we strike.”

Xuan Ming stroked his beard. “Your counsel holds merit. What else have you learned, Yan Zhao?”

The once-proud senior disciple bowed low, venom and ambition carefully veiled beneath dutiful mien.
