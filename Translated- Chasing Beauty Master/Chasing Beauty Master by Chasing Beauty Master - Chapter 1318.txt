Guan Yu glanced at Senior Brother Qi and said, “Senior Brother Qi, I never expected you to flee so swiftly that day at Black Blood Ridge. When I ignited the wine cellar and blew up the place, I wondered where you’d gone. Only later did I learn you’d already escaped with Xiaotong.”

“Guan Yu,” Senior Brother Qi retorted coldly, “mind your tone. By the seniority of our entry into the sect, I rank a full generation above you here.”

“We share the same master as fellow disciples—you as senior brother, I as junior. What ‘generational difference’ exists?” Guan Yu smiled. “Must you constantly scheme to assert superiority? Even the thickest skin has its limits.”

Senior Brother Qi ignored him and turned to Xuan Ming, bowing respectfully. “Master, I shall dismiss Guan Yu’s mockery as the immaturity of youth.”

Guan Yu stared at him in disbelief. So this hypocrite still played the noble act?

“Senior Brother Qi,” Guan Yu sneered, “why feign virtue here? Everyone knows your true colors.”

“Guan Yu!” Senior Brother Qi’s face darkened. “Cease your slander, or I’ll have no choice but to teach you respect!”

“Ah, struck a nerve?” Guan Yu chuckled, unperturbed. “Let’s set aside Black Blood Ridge for now. You accused me of colluding with a demonic sect sorceress. Pray tell—where is this alleged collaborator?”

Senior Brother Qi’s eyes gleamed. “You dare bring this up? The woman Wang Xiaorong who accompanied you to rescue Xiaotong is none other than the daughter of the Soul Demon Sect’s Demon Lord—their Young Mistress! Deny your alliance now!”

“Lies!” Guan Yu shot back. “Are your eyes dead fish guts? When did you witness me conspiring with her? She followed us to save Xiaotong—a disciple of our Cloud Azure Sect! Does aiding our own make her my accomplice?”

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the hall. The sect elders nodded—saving their disciple remained paramount, regardless of the demonic sect’s involvement.

Yet Xuan Ming’s face remained stern. To him, all demonic practitioners deserved death, their very presence a contamination. His wife’s murder by demonic hands a century prior had etched this creed in blood.

“As one of Cloud Azure’s top four disciples,” Senior Brother Qi pressed, “how dare you fraternize with our enemies? What arrogance lets you stand here unrepentant?”

Xuan Ming’s voice rumbled like distant thunder. “Qi speaks truth. Guan Yu—explain your dealings with this demoness.”

“Master,” Guan Yu bowed, “after Xiaotong’s capture, we desperately sought clues. Wang Xiaorong approached us claiming she could help. With no alternatives and time short, I accepted. She guided us through the Yang Forest’s traps at great personal risk, aided our assault on Black Blood Ridge, and fought fiercely against the Blood Lord. Without her, we’d have failed. I swear I never knew her true identity until Senior Brother Qi revealed it later. My companions can attest to this.”

He gestured to Siqi and Xiao Zhi, who nodded vigorously. Xiaorong had harmed none and saved Xiaotong—how could she be wholly evil?

“Ignorance of her identity was reckless,” Xuan Ming said, though his tone softened slightly. “The demonic sect’s blades strike from shadows. Are you certain you weren’t deceived?”

Siqi stepped forward. “Sect Master, we suffered no deception. After escaping Black Blood Ridge, Wang Xiaorong departed and hasn’t been seen since.”

“Good.” Xuan Ming nodded. “Avoid her henceforth. That demoness’s cunning ensnares even the wary.”

“We understand,” the disciples chorused. Guan Yu noted his master’s unyielding hatred but held his tongue.

“Guan Yu,” Xiaotong interjected, “you, Brother Jinci, and Siqi were all injured. Are you recovered?”

“We’re well,” Guan Yu smiled. “Brother Jinci simply craved wine—he’s drinking in his quarters now.”

Senior Brother Qi scoffed. “And you dare mention drinking? That fool got drunk during critical moments! As for Xiao Zhi and Aze—gambling with Black Blood Ridge lackeys! Had I not intervened, you’d all be corpses!”

Xiao Zhi and Aze hung their heads, but Guan Yu fired back, “Despite his drinking, Brother Jinci fought valiantly to save Xiaotong. Unlike some who cowered outside the Blood Lord’s lair like a turtle retreating into its shell. Fitting you only managed to light fires and cause distractions.”

**Chapter 3403: Absent From Start to Finish**

“Lies!” Senior Brother Qi’s eyes bulged. “I’m the one who brought Xiaotong back!”

“Your shamelessness astounds,” Guan Yu retorted. “Could you have rescued her without us defeating the Blood Lord?”

“Of course! When I arrived, you were all defeated. My timely intervention saved Xiaotong and slew the Blood Lord!”

Guan Yu barked a laugh. “You killed the Blood Lord? Xiaotong—what do you recall?”

“I... remember Guan Yu using a hidden weapon to kill him before I fainted,” Xiaotong said hesitantly. “When I awoke, we were already back.”

“Well, Senior Brother Qi?” Guan Yu arched an eyebrow.

Senior Brother Qi paled. Despite last night’s coaching, Xiaotong had revealed the truth. Gritting his teeth, he recalled his masters’ warning—stay calm, never lose composure.

Elder Lu, who’d remained silent, now stood with a smirk. “Qi, earlier you claimed the Blood Lord’s kill. How reconcile these accounts?”

“Master,” Senior Brother Qi knelt, “perhaps Xiaotong’s memory fails. When I arrived, Guan Yu’s group lay defeated. I delivered the final blow.”

Xuan Ming turned to Xiaotong. “Recount everything.”

She complied, detailing the battle without once mentioning Senior Brother Qi’s presence. When asked, Senior Brother Qi stammered, “I... was creating diversions outside!”

Elder Lu slammed his fist. “Liar! Not one witness places you there until the end! You spun tales of valor while others bled!”

Senior Brother Qi glared at Xiaotong. “I saved you! Speak truth!”

“Enough!” Elder Lu thundered. “Xiaotong’s account matches others’. You’ve deceived the entire sect!”

As Senior Brother Qi knelt trembling, Xuan Ming sighed deeply. “Leave us. We’ll speak no more of this.”

**Chapter 3404: False Intelligence**

After others departed, Guan Yu remained. “Master, our sect harbors demonic spies. They knew about my artifacts.”

“All sects face this,” Xuan Ming waved dismissively. “Your Blazing Heaven Furnace—formerly Bloodwing Patriarch’s treasure—made you a target. But you triumphed. Rewards will come later.”

Guan Yu sensed evasion. The furnace’s origins were no secret—had Xuan Ming knowingly used him as bait?

“To mislead spies,” Guan Yu proposed, “spread word you confiscated my artifacts as punishment.”

Xuan Ming nodded. “Consider it done. Rest now. Soon, you’ll journey to Duobao Mountain—demonic forces gather there seeking the Eight-Sided Drum cultivation method. Beat them to it.”

“We leave at dawn,” Guan Yu vowed. The game continued—pawns and players ever shifting in the eternal dance between light and shadow.
