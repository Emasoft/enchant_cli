“I didn’t expect this girl to be so alert. I merely got a little closer, and you noticed me.” Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) leapt down from a tree.

Xiao Zhi, startled by Jinciyu Lang’s sudden appearance and knowing the man was a supreme expert, quickly greeted him with joy. “Brother Jinci! You’ve come!”

Aze also looked relieved. With Jinciyu Lang’s help, rescuing Xiaotong should no longer be a problem.

“You know each other?” Wang Xiaorong pointed at Jinciyu Lang, her tone clearly displeased. “Why didn’t you mention bringing backup earlier?”

Guan Yu smiled apologetically. “Don’t blame me. I had no idea he’d been following me this whole time. He’s always liked lurking in the shadows. Besides, I didn’t know he’d join us this time.”

Having another ally should’ve been a good thing. Wang Xiaorong’s irritation made little sense.

Wang Xiaorong studied Jinciyu Lang, sensing he was a cultivator, though his exact level eluded her. “I’m not against you seeking help, but the gear I brought is only enough for five. An extra person complicates things.”

“Don’t worry about me. No matter what happens, I can handle myself,” Jinciyu Lang declared confidently.

Seeing his resolve, Wang Xiaorong dropped the matter and turned to lead the group forward.

Entering the poplar grove, darkness enveloped them. Even with Guan Yu’s sharp vision, he could only make out the silhouettes of those nearby. The dense trees forced them to squeeze sideways through narrow gaps.

After a while, a sudden wind arose—strange, given the grove’s thickness. Wang Xiaorong hissed, “Stop! Huddle together and stay still.” The group formed a protective circle, shielding Wang Xiaorong and Siqi at the center.

The wind intensified, carrying a foul stench. “Take out the cloth strips I gave you!” Wang Xiaorong ordered. “Piss on them, now!”

“What?!” The men gaped. Xiao Zhi blurted, “We brought these rags just to pee on?!”

“Stop whining! Do it unless you want to die! The urine neutralizes the poison in this miasma,” she snapped.

As the men hastily complied, Siqi froze. The men had it easy, but she couldn’t relieve herself publicly. Desperate, she glanced at Wang Xiaorong—surely another woman would understand.

Guan Yu, having held it in, unleashed a torrent. Jinciyu Lang, lacking a cloth, ripped off his sleeve instead.

Wang Xiaorong snatched Guan Yu’s damp cloth. “Ugh! How long were you holding this in? It reeks!” She tied it over her face despite complaints.

“What about me now?” Guan Yu protested.

“Piss more,” she said dismissively.

“I’m empty!”

Jinciyu Lang offered his urine-soaked sleeve mixed with Guan Yu’s cloth. “Here, little brother. Don’t say I never helped you.”

Meanwhile, Siqi stood paralyzed until Xiao Zhi offered his cloth. “Use mine. Aze and I can share.”

“Never!” she recoiled.

Wang Xiaorong intervened, blending Siqi’s cloth with Guan Yu’s. “This’ll dilute the stench. His brew’s too potent.”

Reluctantly, Siqi tied the cloth as black miasma thickened. The stench penetrated even through their makeshift masks. “Stay close!” Wang Xiaorong commanded. “Don’t move until this passes!”

**Chapter 3370: Night Assault on the Poplar Grove (Part 2)**

The group clung together for nearly an hour until the miasma dissipated. Wang Xiaorong ripped off her mask. “Finally! Let’s—*ptui!*—Guan Yu, your piss is vile!”

Guan Yu smirked inwardly. *Serves you right for stealing mine instead of preparing your own.*

“Keep the cloths,” she warned. “We might need them again.”

“Again?!” Guan Yu groaned as Jinciyu Lang chuckled. “Don’t worry—I’ll top yours up later.”

Resuming their trek, Wang Xiaorong navigated using a compass. Guan Yu marveled at her preparedness—without it, they’d be hopelessly lost.

“How much further to Heixue Ridge?” Guan Yu asked.

“Miles yet. That miasma was a pre-set trap—wind spells mixed with poison stored in the trees. Triggers when disturbed.”

“How’d you know urine works?”

“How do you know you’re male?” she retorted. “Ask later.”

The trees grew impossibly dense. As they squeezed through, Jinciyu Lang suddenly cursed. “Snakes! Hundreds!”

Siqi shrieked, clinging to Guan Yu. Wang Xiaorong produced a gourd, splashed liquor on her trousers, and passed it around. “Snakes hate alcohol. Soak your clothes.”

Jinciyu Lang took swigs between applications. “Waste of good liquor!”

“Stop drinking!” Wang Xiaorong snatched the gourd. “We need this!”

The snakes recoiled from the scent, allowing safe passage. Guan Yu shuddered at the sea of serpents glinting in the dark.

“Hold hands to stay together,” Guan Yu suggested.

Wang Xiaorong ignored him, pressing forward. When questioned about her knowledge, she said darkly, “Others died to teach me these lessons.”

As they navigated, Xiao Zhi asked why they couldn’t take shortcuts.

“Only Heixue Ridge insiders know those paths,” Guan Yu answered.

Jinciyu Lang added, “In this maze, we’re lucky to move at all.”

The group pressed on, unaware of what fresh horrors awaited in the heart of the grove.
