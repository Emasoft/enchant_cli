The old man had just flashed so much gold earlier, leading one to believe he was a generous buyer. Yet who could have imagined he'd turn out to be such a picky customer?

Watching the man approach the main gates, the stable owner grew frantic. Seeing no alternative left, he shouted, "One hundred forty taels! How about it? Surely this price satisfies you?"

Guanyu turned with a smile. "Would such a grand stable haggle over mere forty taels? The hundred taels I offered is already generous. You're still turning profit—this horse didn't cost half that when acquired. Refuse, and you'll wait till the next buyer comes."

The owner's face fell as Guanyu pierced through his calculations. Indeed, this was a purebred prairie crimson stallion—the finest specimen available. Many generals chose these fiery steeds for battle. Legend told of one marshal whose crimson mount charged thrice through enemy lines, slaughtering countless foes. After the steed's glorious death, even the emperor posthumously honored it with a title.

Though peerless in breed, this particular stallion possessed a vicious temper. Bought cheaply from the grasslands precisely because none could tame it, the beast remained untrained. A warhorse requires discipline—something this crimson demon lacked. The owner had acquired it for twenty taels, hoping to profit from resale.

"One hundred twenty taels, good sir! Consider those extra twenty as consolation for my wounded pride!" The owner's voice cracked with desperation. Those twenty taels might compensate his brother-in-law's injuries from being thrown earlier.

Guanyu pondered. Though certain he could secure it for a hundred, he wearied of haggling. "Very well. One-twenty it is—provided you honor your promise of premium tack."

"My honored ancestor! That saddle set costs thirty taels! Giving it free would ruin me!" The owner wailed. "At two hundred I could include it, but one-twenty? Impossible!"

Guanyu snorted. The tack couldn't cost more than ten taels, even with exotic leathers. "Final offer—one-twenty with the saddle set." He began walking away.

"Fine!" The owner threw up his hands. "But return for future purchases! Bring friends! Today I sell at loss!"

Guanyu knew better. No merchant sold at loss—even as horse meat, this steed would turn profit. After securing the fiery mount, he struggled to fit the tack himself—the stallion permitting none else near.

Preparations complete, Guanyu hung a gourd of water (not wine) from the saddle. As night fell, he reached Liu Willow Town—a ramshackle settlement marked by wooden archway. Spotting a tavern displaying ghost moth insignia (Demon Soul Sect's symbol), he entered.

Inside, a youth approached. "Your order, sir?"

"I need message sent to Demon Soul Sect. Any winged couriers here?"

"Credentials first, as protocol demands."

Guanyu's jaw tightened. "Summon your master. And bring wine with two dishes."

The tavern's layout impressed him—Demon Soul Sect's intelligence network dwarfed Cloud Azure Sect's antiquated methods. While Cloud Azure hoarded disciples behind mountain walls, their rivals built commercial fronts across the realm—taverns and tea houses funding both coffers and espionage.

Soon led upstairs, Guanyu froze upon recognizing the figure gorging on sweets. "Xiao Qi! What brings you here?"

The wolf-blooded youth grinned. "Why the surprise? Though your disguise fools commoners..." He gestured at Guanyu's smooth cheeks. "...no elder has such complexion. And those hands!"

Xiao Qi explained his exile here as political leverage over his brother San Tou, now serving the Demon Lord in deserts. Guanyu declined staying but requested disguise lessons. As they feasted, plans formed—until dawn's light would part them again.

Beyond Hār City's walls, the crimson demon showed its worth. Wind whipped Guanyu's face raw as landscape blurred beneath thundering hooves. Yet the ride felt smooth—whether from quality tack or the stallion's innate grace.

In the tavern's upper chamber, Xiao Qi's laughter turned bitter. "The Demon Lord uses me as leash for San Tou. While my brother quests in deserts, I rot here managing tavern accounts."

Guanyu's thoughts turned to political webs—how Demon Soul Sect's tavern network funded ambitions, while rival factions waited to pounce on any weakness. Yet for now, messages needed sending, disguises required perfecting. Dawn would bring new roads, but tonight reunited comrades savored stolen hours.
