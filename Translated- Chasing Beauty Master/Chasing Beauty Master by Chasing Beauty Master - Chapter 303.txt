He likely understood Wen Ya's temperament well - diligent, strong-willed, principled, yet still fiery and decisive. Otherwise, she wouldn't have nearly kicked that playboy's balls into oblivion.

"Ahaha, seems more like karmic retribution from a past life. Another campus beauty about to fall into your clutches," Wen Qing feigned lamentation.

Guan Yu rubbed his temples in exasperation. "Looks like she's in some trouble."

As Wen Qing turned, she saw a handsome man in tailored suit approaching Wen Ya with red roses. Though Wen Ya maintained her composure, subtle irritation flickered through her delicate features.

"Who's that?" Guan Yu inquired.

"Oh? Planning to rescue the damsel and win her favor?" Wen Qing teased.

"You know that's not my intention," Guan Yu said wryly.

"Let's be serious. That's Zhan Shouwang - a so-called gentleman from influential family. He's been pursuing Wen Ya relentlessly through increasingly public displays that only pressure and embarrass her."

"But as an educated man, surely he's not that bad?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Husband, don't you know the term 'wolf in scholar's clothing'? That hypocrite's nothing compared to you," Wen Qing sniffed, her eyes glinting with mischief. "If you pursued Wen Ya, you'd easily succeed."

"My plate's full with six of you already," Guan Yu chuckled nervously.

"But your... special mission requires more," Wen Qing pressed. "This is your chance to redeem yourself after wronging her. Remember, you represent our school's honor."

Chapter 767: Dance Invitation

"Wen Ya, you dance exquisitely!" Zhan Shouwang offered his roses with practiced charm.

"Thank you," Wen Ya replied coolly, sidestepping the flowers.

The crowd erupted in demands for an encore. Zhan Shouwang's smile turned predatory. "You wouldn't disappoint everyone, would you?"

Wen Ya's delicate brows furrowed as Zhan leveraged the crowd's pressure. "One last dance," she conceded.

Zhan pressed his advantage. "A partner dance! Who better than a former dance champion?" His gesture toward himself drew thunderous cheers.

When Wen Ya hesitated, Zhan whispered venomously, "Your father's street stall license... Such a shame if revoked." Wen Ya paled.

"Miss, may I have this dance?" A familiar voice cut through the tension. Wen Ya turned to see Guan Yu's reassuring smile.

"You?" Wen Ya blinked in surprise.

"Student Council President Guan Yu at your service." His eyes twinkled. "Care to dance with your boyfriend?"

The crowd gasped as Wen Ya's hand met Guan Yu's. "My pleasure," she smiled.

Chaos erupted when Zhan attacked. Guanå®‡ whirled Wen Ya through attackers like dancing partners, her white dress swirling as his precise kicks dispatched thugs with balletic grace.

"Your parents are safe now," Guan Yu murmured afterward. "I'll handle that scum."

Wen Ya arched an eyebrow. "Don't presume this means anything. You still owe me a job."

"Then let's discuss your new position," Guan Yu grinned. "Leading dancer for the centennial gala's finale."
