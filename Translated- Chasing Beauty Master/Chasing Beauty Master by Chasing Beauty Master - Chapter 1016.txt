“Well said, Wei Hongwei!” Guan Yu silently praised Wei Hongwei’s retort. With a faint smile, he remarked, “A million is indeed rather paltry. Let me propose this: the treasure map fragment in my possession measures roughly ten centimeters. I’ll divide it into twenty pieces and sell each for a million. How does that sound?”

Bill Lin’s expression darkened. Guan Yu was essentially demanding twenty million—a staggering sum. “Guan Yu, you want twenty million for a mere fragment? Isn’t that excessively steep? Do you truly believe this scrap of a map warrants such value? Even if the treasure were real, whether it’d justify twenty million remains uncertain.”

Guan Yu shook his head coldly. “Not a penny less than thirty million.”

Bill Lin’s face tightened. Guan Yu was toying with him. Thirty million? Preposterous. No one would pay such an exorbitant price for a fragment.

Guan Yu pressed on, “The treasure map you acquired at the Yang Family Auction wasn’t cheap either. Besides, thirty million is but a trifle for the Bill Family.”

“Even if my family swims in wealth, we don’t squander it recklessly,” Bill Lin retorted. “The auction was a different matter—only one fragment surfaced then, driving up its worth.”

After a pause, Bill Lin ventured boldly, “Thirty million, then? My family can afford it, but paying that for a mere fragment feels unjust. Here’s a counteroffer: include the beauty beside you in the deal, and we’ll consider it settled.”

Even now, Bill Lin couldn’t relinquish his lust for Xue Jing—a woman whose allure transcended monetary value. To him, thirty million seemed a bargain.

Xue Jing shot to her feet, ready to teach Bill Lin a lesson, but Guan Yu gripped her wrist, signaling restraint.

“Let me slit that bastard’s throat!” Xue Jing hissed.

“He’s all bark,” Guan Yu said, though his own anger simmered. Turning sharply to Bill Lin, he warned, “Mind your tongue from this moment onward, lest I knock your teeth out. You’ve soured my mood. The deal’s off. Leave—now.”

His tone carried the authority of a commander. For a heartbeat, Bill Lin nearly obeyed, then caught himself. Why should he heed Guan Yu?

As Guan Yu’s words faded, distant clanging echoed up the mountain. A man rushed to Bill Lin’s side, whispering urgently, “Young Master! Trouble! A large armed force is ascending on foot. They’ve bypassed our roadblocks.”

“What? How?” Bill Lin paled. “I barricaded every route!”

“The barriers halt vehicles, not men. From the gate, you can see them swarming up the trails.”

The distant commotion eased Guan Yu’s tension. The endgame approached.

Outside, Young Master Feng paced like an ant on a hot skillet, helplessly watching the encroaching crowd. Only four guards remained. From his vantage point, the winding path teemed with figures inching upward.

Dense foliage obscured the lower slopes, granting those above clearer sightlines. Below, Jia Bo led the Yu Gang members, grumbling about the arduous climb. “Damn those bastards blocking the road! Once we’re up there, we’ll pound them into pulp!”

The gang roared agreement. One member suggested, “Brother Jia, why not clear the main barricade? With our numbers, we could carve a path.”

Jia Bo nodded. “Brute force, but effective.” The earthen mound, taller than a house, seemed insurmountable—yet flanking it by felling two half-meter-thick trees might allow vehicles through.

As they debated, nine unmarked vans arrived. Tension spiked until Jiang Fenju emerged from the lead vehicle. Recognition dawned—reinforcements!

“Brother Jiang! The road’s blocked. We’re trying to clear it,” Jia Bo reported.

Jiang Fenju assessed the situation. “My cultivators can ascend swiftly, but your men… Let’s flatten this mound instead.”

Working together, they shifted earth and felled trees, gradually creating a bypass. Above, Young Master Feng peered through binoculars, desperation mounting.

Bursting into the courtyard, he hissed at Bill Lin, “They’re breaching the barriers! Quit dawdling!”

Guan Yu interjected, “Bill Lin may leave, but Young Master Feng stays. We have… unfinished business.”

Panicked, Feng blustered, “Cross me, and you cross the Bill Family!”

Guan Yu laughed. “The Bill Family? God Himself couldn’t shield you today.”

Feng drew a pistol, but a blur—Qiong Si—disarmed him, pinning both young masters beneath her boots. Her gun pressed to Hada’s forehead froze the burly guard.

“Anyone else care to move?” Qiong Si panted, having sprinted up the mountain.

Guan Yu rose, scattering the two hundred thugs like startled birds. “Young Master Feng, guns are dangerous toys. You might hurt yourself.”

Blood streamed from Feng’s broken nose. “I’m bleeding! Help!” he wailed, but none dared stir under Qiong Si’s glare.

Bill Lin, nursing bruises, ordered lackeys to tend Feng, but Guan Yu halted them. “He stays. Stuff his nostrils with tissue.”

Below, the Yu Gang and Jiang Fenju’s cultivators breached the final barriers, vehicles grinding upward. Upon reaching the summit, they found the temple forecourt littered with bloodied bricks and wounded men.

Securing the perimeter, Jiang Fenju stormed the courtyard, disarming the mob. “Apologies for the delay, Boss,” he greeted Guan Yu.

Jia Bo spat, “Damn roadblocks slowed us. Whose bright idea was that?”

Guan Yu smiled. “Timing’s perfect.”

The tide had turned.
