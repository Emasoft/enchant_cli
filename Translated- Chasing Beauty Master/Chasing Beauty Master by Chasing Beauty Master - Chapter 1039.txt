Sure enough, in the distance, Guan Yu heard the screech of brakes followed by chaotic footsteps. When he turned around, he saw Jia Bo's figure leading the charge through the darkness.

Before Jia Bo even reached them, he spotted Guan Yu and Xue Jing standing together. "Boss, we're here!" he shouted exuberantly, his voice brimming with the excitement of a loyal hound reuniting with its master.

**Chapter 2656: Inviting Him Out**

Guan Yu nodded at Jia Bo. "Perfect timing. We need you here."

Without hesitation, Jia Bo and his men charged into the fray, weapons in hand. The arrival of over a hundred Yu Gang members instantly bolstered the morale of the Freedom Organization fighters, their momentum surging like a tidal wave.

As the Yu Gang joined the battle, their opponents began retreating under the onslaught. Watching from the rear, Ge Yinglai felt a flicker of relief. "That bootlicker Jia Bo is already wagging his tail for Guan Yu," he sneered. "Let these bastards fall into my hands one day—I’ll make them regret being born."

Sun Xu harbored even deeper hatred for Jia Bo. Their rivalry dated back to their days at Kaihuang Academy, where Jia Bo had once been an insignificant ant beneath Sun Xu’s feet. But after aligning with Guan Yu, Jia Bo had risen swiftly, relentlessly undermining Sun Xu ever since.

The mere sight of Jia Bo now made both men yearn to tear him limb from limb.

"With the Yu Gang here, it seems Guan Yu hasn’t plotted anything else," Ge Yinglai speculated. "Perhaps their late arrival was due to last-minute mobilization."

Sun Xu nodded. "I overthought it. This must be Guan Yu’s full force. These bastards are all he’s got left."

"Exactly. I think it’s time we… *invite him out*," Ge Yinglai said cryptically.

Before departing, Bill Lin had left behind an elite from the Bill family—the diminutive elder who often accompanied him. Stationed at the Feng residence as contingency support, this expert named Luo Bo had one duty: to ensure Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu returned alive. Though Bill Lin viewed them as expendable pawns, he adhered to the principle of leaving no variable unchecked.

Sun Xu proposed, "If we deploy Luo Bo now, his intervention could devastate Guan Yu. If he defeats that woman guarding Guan Yu, capturing him might actually be possible."

Agreeing, the pair resolved to summon Luo Bo. His primary mission was their protection, but Sun Xu’s persuasion hinged on appealing to Bill Lin’s obsession—the women in Guan Yu’s household and the treasure map. Seizing Guan Yu would unlock both.

Sun Xu cautiously dialed Luo Bo, adopting an uncharacteristically deferential tone. "Mr. Luo Bo, we humbly request your assistance in capturing their leader. This is the perfect opportunity to please Young Master Bill Lin." His broken English strained Luo Bo’s patience.

"Capture is *your* task," Luo Bo replied coldly, roused from meditation in his car. "My duty is to prevent your deaths, not clean up your failures."

Undeterred, Sun Xu pressed, "This man is Young Master Bill’s greatest enemy. Miss this chance, and we may never get another." When promises of rewards failed, he invoked Bill Lin’s desires: "Imagine the Young Master’s delight if you deliver Guan Yu—and access to those women."

Reluctantly, Luo Bo acquiesced. Moments after hanging up, he materialized beside Sun Xu, gesturing toward Guan Yu atop a distant vehicle. "Him?"

"Yes! His only guard is that woman. Strike from the shadows—end this tonight!" Sun Xu urged.

Luo Bo vanished into the crowd, assessing his target. Guan Yu’s aura puzzled him—an elusive blend of strength and mundanity. Yet confidence overrode doubt.

From their vantage point, Guan Yu and Xue Jing monitored the battle. Though Yu Gang’s student fighters suffered injuries, the Freedom Organization’s support tipped the scales. Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei’s team ravaged Ge Yinglai’s properties—bars, internet cafes, spas—leaving ruins in their wake.

**Chapter 2657: Hearts Turn Cold**

Wang Hu struck Sun Xu’s suburban stronghold—a four-story office building—with similar brutality. Guards subdued, his men smashed everything in sight.

When Ge Yinglai’s informant called, panic crackled through the receiver: "Our venues are being destroyed! They’re pouring gasoline to burn everything!"

"Impossible!" Ge Yinglai roared. "The Yu Gang is *here*!"

Sun Xu’s realization came too late. Before he could process the implications, his mistress’s frantic call confirmed his fears: Yu Gang remnants were demolishing his own hideout. A crash and scream marked the call’s abrupt end.

Sun Xu hurled his phone, howling, "Guan Yu, you son of a bitch! I’ll tear you apart!" He grabbed a bat, but Ge Yinglai restrained him. "You’ll die before reaching him! Our only hope is Luo Bo!"

Clenching his fists, Sun Xu glared at Guan Yu. "Make him suffer! *Make him beg for death!*"

Unfazed, Guan Yu coldly observed the chaos. Tonight’s bloodshed served one purpose: to eradicate Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu. The attack on his home and Shuangshuang’s near-fatal injury demanded absolute retribution.

**Chapter 2658: My Brother-in-Law**

A glint of steel pierced the darkness. Xue Jing shoved Guan Yu aside as blades clashed—Luo Bo’s dagger met Second-to-Wolf’s broadsword in a shower of sparks.

"Luo Bo," Second-to-Wolf drawled, "still doing Bill’s dirty work? Shouldn’t you be retired?"

"Second-to-Wolf?" Luo Bo’s surprise gave way to a smirk. "Since when do you protect children?"

"He’s my brother-in-law. And you—sneak attacking kids? How the mighty have fallen."

Luo Bo’s smile turned venomous. "Step aside. He dies tonight."

Second-to-Wolf spun his blade. "You’ll have to go through me first."

The standoff crackled with tension as two veterans circled—one fueled by duty, the other by vengeance. Behind them, the battle raged on, its outcome hinging on this duel under the moonless sky.
