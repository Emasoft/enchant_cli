Ge Yinglai now resembled a headless fly, utterly at a loss. His sole thoughts revolved around exonerating himself or escaping should matters escalate.

“I’ve never heard of these accusations, nor have I participated in any of this,” he declared. “Guan Yu claims I sold drugs? Where’s his proof? What a joke! I could just as easily accuse him!

I come here daily for entertainment. Is spending money and enjoying myself illegal? Moreover, Sister Ji and I are barely acquainted. Her affairs have nothing to do with me.” Ge Yinglai had already distanced himself from Guan Yu and Sister Ji, both parties now scrambling to shift blame.

“Whether you’re involved or not will be determined where you’re headed,” Patriarch Yang retorted. As his words faded, shouts erupted beyond the crowd: “Make way! Clear the path!”

Someone pushed through the throng, their urgency met by the crowd parting obediently. A burly middle-aged man in full police gear—bulletproof vest, revolver in hand—led the charge. Behind him trailed dozens of officers armed to the teeth with assault rifles.

The lead officer approached Patriarch Yang. “We came as soon as we received your report, Patriarch Yang. Followed your instructions—no sirens. Didn’t scare off the suspects, I hope?”

“Well done, Officer Gao,” Patriarch Yang replied. “Initially, I reported two culprits, but it seems there are three.” He pointed at Ge Yinglai, Sister Ji, and the bald man.

Ge Yinglai scrutinized Officer Gao, confirming he didn’t recognize him. Panic simmered, but he mustered defiance: “These aren’t real officers! Patriarch Yang fabricated this charade to frame me! You won’t take me!”

Sister Ji’s expression eased, swayed by Ge Yinglai’s logic. Having operated in City A for years, she’d never encountered these officers either. They must be imposters hired by Patriarch Yang.

“Truly despicable,” Officer Gao remarked coldly. “Peddling that filth in schools—utterly heartless.”

As he spoke, his subordinates trained their guns on the trio. The message was clear: move, and bullets would fly.

The bald man gaped at Sister Ji. “You said this was just a small favor! Since when did it involve this circus?” Fear tinged his voice—understandable under dozens of gun barrels.

Sister Ji remained composed, her demeanor reflecting years of navigating treacherous waters. A woman who’d clawed her way to prominence wasn’t easily rattled.

“Tonight’s events are a misunderstanding,” she said smoothly. “Even if Guan Yu slanders me, where’s his evidence? You can’t arrest people based on baseless claims and dubious ‘officers.’ I’m a law-abiding citizen.”

Officer Gao’s patience frayed. Striding forward, he flashed a badge before her eyes. “Recognize this emblem?”

Sister Ji paled, trembling as she read the credentials. “You’re… National SWAT?”

“Correct,” Officer Gao boomed. “Patriarch Yang reported directly to us, bypassing local precincts. Wealth and connections won’t save you here. We operate under national jurisdiction—no exceptions.”

Dread gripped both Sister Ji and Ge Yinglai. Local cops might’ve been bribed, but National SWAT? Their cases faced public scrutiny—no backroom deals.

Ge Yinglai plotted escape. Edging toward a storefront, he planned to scale to the second floor and vanish into darkness. Once abroad, he’d be untouchable.

As Patriarch Yang conversed with Officer Gao, Ge Yinglai seized his moment. He leapt onto a windowsill—only to meet Jones’ furious kick mid-ascent.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

The cultivator tumbled down, handcuffed and shackled with reinforced steel. Sister Ji and the bald man followed, subdued under rifle threats.

Passing Patriarch Yang, Sister Ji hissed, “Tell Guan Yu this isn’t over—if I survive.”

With the trio detained, the crowd dispersed. Meanwhile, Guan Yu lounged in Qiaoyuan District’s parlor, playing mahjong with girls, his face plastered with loser’s paper strips.

Patriarch Yang’s call interrupted: “It’s done. Gao’s team took them. Next, the cafeteria.”

“Seal it tomorrow,” Guan Yu ordered. “Shut down permanently.”

Though the main players fell, fallout rippled through City A’s underworld. Guan Yu’s crackdown sent drug peddlers scrambling—even touching powerful families like the Fengs. But with the Bill family’s backing, the Fengs evaded consequences, leaving Guan Yu frustrated.

As for Ge Yinglai and Sister Ji’s fate? Guan Yu cared little. His failure lay in unmasking Ge’s backer.

The next day, Guan Yu’s plans to visit Jin Hua crumbled under Xue Jing’s surveillance. She shadowed him relentlessly—even to the bathroom—foiling any solo excursion.

“You’re coming with me,” Xue Jing insisted, dragging him along.

“Must you? I won’t bolt!”

“Your credibility’s shot. Nobody here trusts you.”

Guan Yu groaned. “Is my reputation that ruined?”

“You did this to yourself,” Xue Jing retorted. “Now hurry—I can’t hold it!”

Later, a “distinguished guest” arrived—Lin Qiaoqiao, Xue Jing’s police friend. Dressed in violet, she brought two tidings: a first-class honor for resolving the school case, and a classified file from China’s Celestial Dragon Organization.

“This,” she said, producing the dossier, “is an opportunity for you, Guan Yu.”

As Xue Jing buzzed with excitement, Guan Yu’s thoughts drifted to the mysterious Golden Dagger—its inscribed secrets still waiting, just like his stifled freedom.
