The more than ten clones summoned were sent scattering in panic by Guan Yu’s onslaught. At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared at the street corner carrying over a dozen flashlights whose blinding beams pierced through the darkness. The flashlight-wielding figure dashed over within a few breaths.

Guan Yu focused his gaze and recognized the newcomer as Jin Hua. Dressed in black nightclothes with her face veiled by a dark gauze mask, her hair tied into two charming pigtails, her attire mirrored what she’d worn during their time at Yang Cong’han’s villa.

Under the intense flashlight glare, the enemy clones’ movements visibly slowed. Guan Yu clearly identified their true body standing toward the left rear—their weakness exposed. Without shadows under strong light, the clones’ lack of silhouettes betrayed the original’s position.

“Why are you here?” Guan Yu asked while still swinging his small tree weapon.

“I sensed you were in trouble and worried! This foe’s immensely powerful but fears light. I bought all these flashlights to help!” Jin Hua replied with a coquettish lilt.

Truthfully, Jin Hua was an utterly captivating siren. Every sway of her hips evoked primal desires, her stunning face paired with a body honed by bone-shrinking techniques creating irresistible allure.

“Thanks, but aren’t you risking exposure?” Guan Yu teased, his recovering left hand playfully grazing her buttocks. A simultaneous gasp escaped them both—Jin Hua’s from pleasure, Guan Yu’s from sudden pain as hidden poisoned barbs on her custom nightwear pricked his injured hand.

This specialized attire, her own invention, featured deerskin lining layered with toxin-coated spikes beneath black fabric. Guan Yu had assumed only her chest bore traps, but her posterior defenses proved even deadlier.

“Are you kidding? Spikes everywhere?!” Guan Yu groaned, his left arm suffering anew—first battered numb, now poisoned.

“Serves you right for being handsy,” Jin Hua chided while retrieving a small vial from her waist. She uncorked it beneath his nose for him to inhale.

Expecting antidote, Guan Yu drew a deep breath—only to cough violently from the vial’s rancid stench. “What vile concoction is this?!” he sputtered between coughs, nearly retching up earlier consumed alcohol.

“Greedy fool! A tiny whiff suffices,” Jin Hua laughed. As Guan Yu recovered, he realized their formidable opponent had vanished completely—only a bloodstain remaining as proof it wasn’t all a dream. The escape under his watch infuriated him, knowing this unresolved threat would return.

With the enemy gone, Guan Yu noted his left hand’s pain had miraculously subsided from Jin Hua’s foul “antidote.” Whether her intervention helped or hindered remained debatable, but without her flashlights, he’d have been hard-pressed to counter the clones.

“Let’s go home for some...rough play,” Guan Yu leered.

Returning to his vehicle, they found Pan Taisheng still snoring obliviously through the earlier battle. After dropping off Pan and his associate Da Hang, Guan Yu drove Pan’s pickup to Jin Hua’s current residence—the abandoned Sun Family estate. Deemed safest precisely for its notoriety after Guan Yu’s prior raid, its surveillance systems now served as her protection.

Chapter 2022: Special Preparations

Jin Hua had transformed a massive bedroom into her sanctuary, its blackout curtains permitting only computer screen glow. The presidential suite-style room boasted every amenity, including a circular bed draped in fresh floral linens.

Without hesitation, Jin Hua began disrobing before Guan Yu’s rapt gaze. Removing her veil revealed a face more radiant than ever—naturally beautiful without cosmetics. Soon standing completely nude, she carefully hung her venomous nightwear in a dedicated closet section.

“Don’t strain your eyes,” she teased, turning with a smile. “I’ll shower first.”

“Why not together?” Guan Yu countered, swiftly undressing. In the steamy bathroom, he grasped her hips triumphantly: “No poison spikes here now!”

“Patience,” Jin Hua purred, gesturing to a marble counter laden with over twenty adult toys. “I ordered these online. Tonight, we’ll try every one.”

Her fingers trailed his shoulder as she spoke in a breathy tone that set his nerves alight. “Challenge accepted,” Guan Yu growled.

By 2 PM next day, Guan Yu awoke to find Jin Hua still asleep—hardly surprising after their marathon activities until 9 AM. Only her martial arts conditioning prevented collapse from such exertion.

Departing discreetly, Guan Yu visited Qing Ling’er’s apartment where her father Qing Guanghui and his disciple had recovered.

“Uncle Qing, are you well?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Thanks to Ling’er’s care,” Qing Guanghui replied, though his survival likely stemmed from reuniting with his long-lost daughter. The Snake-Eyed Youth expressed gratitude too—uncharacteristic humility from the once-arrogant warrior.

Guan Yu described battling the clone master. Qing Guanghui’s face tightened: “You encountered my junior sister. Only two practitioners remain of our Shadow Clone art—myself and her.”

Shocked Guan Yu recalled the masculine voice, Qing Guanghui explained: “She modulates her tone. Her true voice fuels a self-created Sonic Scream technique—deadly as any lion’s roar.”

Chapter 2023: Old Grudges

Qing Guanghui revealed their history: his master’s daughter had loved him, unaware of his existing family. When the truth emerged, her heartbreak birthed both the Sonic Scream and a corrupted clone technique requiring darkness to function.

“She likely attacked you believing I was dead,” Qing Guanghui sighed. “Our last encounter was decades ago. I must settle this...”

“Don’t!” Guan Yu urged. “Meeting risks disaster. She might kill you and herself if rejected again.”

Nodding grimly, Qing Guanghui acknowledged the peril. Yet both knew this ghost from his past wouldn’t rest—a storm gathering on the horizon.
