“I believe it is time to address the drought in the northern regions. The people are filled with grievances, and the situation must not be allowed to worsen further. I intend to personally approach His Majesty about this matter before he assigns it to the Second Prince’s faction, which would disadvantage us,” said Prince Zou.

The Eldest Prince remarked, “The capital is in uproar over the Cao family affair. At this moment, I doubt Father has the energy to attend to the northern drought.”

“Nevertheless, it must be resolved swiftly. Of course, you cannot leave,” Prince Zou continued. “You must remain here to await His Majesty’s decision regarding the Cao family, particularly the confiscation of their assets. This matter must fall into our hands.”

The Eldest Prince felt uneasy. These past days, Prince Zou had guided his every decision. Without the prince’s counsel, he feared appearing incompetent before the Emperor.

Yet he understood he could not forever rely on Prince Zou. Many matters required his own resolve, and future challenges would demand his independent judgment.

“Your Highness,” the Eldest Prince ventured, “there is something I cannot comprehend.”

“Cao Di was apprehended on the spot, and Patriarch Cao offered no resistance or defense when arrested, silently accepting guilt. Yet several days have passed—why has Father still not pronounced judgment on the Cao family?”

“Because His Majesty waits,” Prince Zou replied. “He does not believe Patriarch Cao acted alone. In recent years, the great families of the capital have grown overly powerful, with many factions infiltrating the court. The Emperor surely intends to use this opportunity to strike at these forces. There is no urgency in sentencing the Cao family yet.”

The Eldest Prince nodded in understanding. The Emperor had always maintained absolute control, permitting no rival power to threaten his throne—not even the slightest hint of opposition. All authority must remain firmly in imperial hands.

Previously, the Emperor had been most at ease with the Second Prince’s influence, believing that as heir apparent, the prince would naturally inherit the dragon throne.

But events proved otherwise. Even the closest kin could not be entrusted with excessive power.

When the Second Prince openly defied the Emperor in the Golden Hall, leaving him furious yet powerless, the sovereign resolved to curtail the prince’s influence and forbid any royal offspring from forming court factions.

However, reclaiming granted authority proved far more difficult than anticipated.

Though the Emperor now wished to bolster the Eldest Prince as counterbalance to the Second Prince, restoring equilibrium to court politics, two obstacles remained: the Emperor’s lack of faith in the Eldest Prince’s capabilities, and the Second Prince’s unexpectedly formidable prowess. Thus, power still tilted overwhelmingly toward the latter.

The weaker the Eldest Prince appeared, the more the Emperor disdained him. Only since Prince Zou’s arrival had the court situation stabilized somewhat.

Deeming delay unwise, Prince Zou sought audience with the Emperor.

“Your Majesty, the northern drought brooks no further neglect. Reports indicate the people have begun rioting—fights break out over scarce resources, and possessions are seized without hesitation. If this continues, control may be lost.”

Prince Zou presented a memorial. The Emperor glanced at it dismissively: “I am aware of this matter. None of the ministers’ reports describe such severity.”

This reaction was anticipated. At this critical juncture, Prince Zou would spare no one’s pride—the people’s welfare took precedence.

“If the unrest spreads as resources dwindle, violence will spill beyond local borders. The wider it spreads, the harder containment becomes.”

Prince Zou pressed on: “Your Majesty receives no such reports because certain powers dictate what memorials reach you. They filter out unpleasant truths, ensuring you only see what pleases them.”

Chapter 4944: Another Decision

The Emperor pursed his lips, sighing helplessly. He knew Prince Zou referred to the Second Prince, whose court dominance was undeniable.

“Five million taels were allocated for northern relief, yet conditions worsened,” the Emperor lamented.

“Ironically,” Prince Zou countered, “investigations show not a single coin reached the north. Local officials plead they never saw the funds.”

This was no isolated incident. Previously enraged by similar corruption, the Emperor had authorized the Embroidered Uniform Guard to investigate and execute offenders without trial.

Yet nothing was uncovered, save the deaths of unrelated officials. With posthumous convictions, the dead could not defend themselves.

All knew the Guard answered to the Second Prince. None but he would dare embezzle such vast sums. The investigation conveniently purged non-allied officials, strengthening rather than threatening the Second Prince’s position.

“Disaster funds are the people’s lifeline. Without proper distribution, grievances will escalate,” Prince Zou urged. “I beg permission to personally escort new funds north. I stake my life on resolving this crisis—failure shall bar my return!”

Though perilous, escorting relief funds offered opportunities for graft. Prince Zou remembered his last arduous journey during floods, surviving only through Hongren’s sacrificed subordinates, whom he later compensated handsomely.

This time, he would again require Hongren’s men—efficient, discreet, and reliable.

“Your dedication heartens Us,” said the Emperor. “Indeed, the crisis cannot worsen. If refugee violence becomes habitual, military intervention may be needed. Among Our courtiers, only you can manage this. For silver to vanish before reaching its destination... such audacious corruption!”

“Under Your Majesty’s wise guidance, the court shall right itself. Some err through confusion, others manipulation—but redemption remains possible.” Prince Zou knelt. “I implore Your Majesty’s sanction.”

The Emperor hesitated. “You have served Us well, but age weighs upon you. This journey may prove too taxing.”

“I live to serve. With the Eldest Prince occupied by the Cao affair, I alone am free to undertake this duty.”

“Very well.” The Emperor decreed: “We appoint you Imperial Commissioner to escort five million taels north. All local officials shall obey your command. Prioritize appeasing the people.”

“Your servant receives the decree!”

This mission differed from others. For Prince Zou, silver mattered less than preventing its diversion by the Second Prince’s faction. Even if five million left the capital, barely half a million might arrive.

Moreover, he refused to let the Second Prince’s allies claim credit for resolving the crisis. For the people’s welfare and political necessity, he accepted the burden.

With imperial approval secured, Prince Zou resolved to visit Guan Yu. His departure left the Eldest Prince vulnerable, requiring someone’s oversight.

Though capable of planning, the Eldest Prince faltered at decisive moments, his impulsiveness breeding conflict. Prince Zou hoped Guan Yu could steady him.

At Wanyang Tavern, Prince Zou paced with a silver cup, awaiting Guan Yu. The once-bustling establishment now stood quiet—absent its regular patrons like Qu Hua, Cao Di, Tang Muchen, and Qin Huan.

Guan Yu arrived alone, having declined female companions to maintain propriety.

“Your Highness summoned me here for more than conversation,” Guan Yu stated directly.

“Indeed. Shall we converse upstairs?” Prince Zou gestured. Guan Yu ascended without ceremony—though respecting the prince’s status, he treated him as an equal.

In an elegant private room laden with delicacies, Guan Yu ate freely. “My thanks for the feast—I arrived unfed.”

“Consider it appreciation for past assistance,” Prince Zou said. “But you’re correct—I require another favor.”

After sharing aged Nu’erhong wine, the prince continued: “I must escort relief funds north, leaving the Eldest Prince adrift. With the Cao verdict pending, if he fails to secure their confiscation, our efforts waste. You alone can guide him.”

Guan Yu demurred: “I lack political acumen, and my commoner status ill suits advising royalty. Moreover, suggesting this to His Highness might breed resentment.”

As Guan Yu persisted in refusal, Prince Zou grew uncertain. “If I depart, the Cao opportunity may slip to the Second Prince.”

“Then remain! This is no time for absence.”

“The drought worsens daily. Last funds vanished—likely the Second Prince’s doing. Unless we intervene, the cycle continues.”
