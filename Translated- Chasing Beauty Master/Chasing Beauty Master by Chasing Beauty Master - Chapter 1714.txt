Guan Yu nodded and said, “By the way, you’ve already told me this last time. But rest assured, it won’t be long before I find the next part of the cultivation technique and deliver it here for your research.”

“That’s excellent news. This is the only thing I can do while confined here,” the tool spirit replied. “Master, have you sensed the growth of your internal energy? I believe your soul consciousness can now venture much farther from your body during astral projection, yes?”

“Venture farther?” Guan Yu understood its meaning—his soul could now travel a greater distance from his physical form. However, he hadn’t tested this yet. “I’ll try it later when I leave,” he mused.

“I’m not entirely sure either,” Guan Yu admitted. “Danger lurks everywhere outside, so I decided not to rest. Instead, I meditated, projected my soul, and came straight here.

“I must admit, I’m almost envious,” the tool spirit said firmly. “This method of cultivation… Master, I speak not to flatter, but you will undoubtedly become a peerless expert.” Its tone brimmed with conviction, bolstering Guan Yu’s confidence.

Naturally, Guan Yu was pleased with his progress. Compared to others starting from the same point, his cultivation speed would leave them far behind—*miles* behind.

“In a few days, if fortune favors us, I’ll obtain the next volume of the Eight-Sided Drum technique,” Guan Yu said calmly. “I hope you can uncover new insights from it then.”

“There should be no issue,” the tool spirit replied confidently. “The technique *will* be yours. Barring unforeseen circumstances, you’re currently the only one in the martial world who dual-cultivates demonic and martial arts. None can rival you. Thus, I’m certain you’ll claim the Eight-Sided Drum technique in the coming struggle. This is my intuition.”

“Well then, I’ll trust your auspicious words,” Guan Yu said. “I must leave now—the outside world is too precarious for me to linger.” Without waiting for a response, he withdrew his consciousness.

Emerging from meditation, Guan Yu decided to test the tool spirit’s claim. How far *could* his soul consciousness travel? Beyond a certain range, he reasoned, perception should fade entirely.

Recalling a distant black pillar spotted earlier that day, Guan Yu directed his astral form toward it, curious to gauge both his limits and the pillar’s nature.

During daylight, the pillar had seemed nearby, but the journey proved deceptively long—a common mirage in deserts, as Siqi had explained. Appearances deceived; distances stretched vast, or illusions mocked the eye.

Now under night’s shroud, visibility dwindled. Guan Yu advanced toward the pillar’s remembered location but found nothing after prolonged travel.

Testing his limits, he discovered his soul consciousness could only perceive clearly within a hundred-meter radius. Beyond that, clarity blurred, sensations dulled. Within the hundred-meter sphere, however, his awareness surpassed even physical sight, capturing every detail.

This confirmed his spiritual reach: a mere hundred meters. Whether this range was impressive or pitiful, Guan Yu couldn’t say. He made a mental note to ask the tool spirit later.

Within the Emperor’s Seal, the tool spirit could perceive Guan Yu’s presence. Outside, his wandering soul consciousness remained invisible—detectable only by supreme experts attuned to such energies.

Finding no trace of the black pillar and constrained by his range, Guan Yu reluctantly recalled his consciousness. Frustration simmered—a hundred meters felt pitifully short. Beyond accelerated cultivation, what use was this?

As winds howled louder, Guan Yu checked the ropes securing camels and tents. Returning, he found Siqi meditating, her face serene yet impassive.

Suddenly—a presence! Guan Yu’s consciousness snapped back outward, scanning from above. There: Ling Su, skulking in the night. What mischief drove him out so late?

The answer came swiftly. Ling Su crept to Guan Yu’s tent, ear pressed against the fabric. Hearing nothing, he moved to the camel herd.

All camels were tethered together to prevent straying. Ling Su drew a dagger and severed the ropes.

Fury ignited in Guan Yu. *Bastard!* Releasing the camels would doom their mission. He watched, seething, as Ling Su—grinning malevolently—systematically cut every tether.

Winds scattered the panicked camels. Without intervention, they’d vanish by dawn. Just as Guan Yu prepared to act, Ling Su’s dagger flashed again.

**Chapter 4484: Motionless**

In a heartbeat, Ling Su snarled, “Screw you, Guan Yu! Steal *my* woman? I’ll ruin everything! To hell with your mission—I’ll slaughter every camel! Let’s see you march tomorrow!”

The dagger plunged into a camel’s throat. No cry—just a thud as the beast collapsed, blood soaking sand. Twitching ceased; life drained away.

Guan Yu’s rage peaked. Even a useless camel didn’t deserve this cruelty. “Ling Su!” his voice boomed from nowhere, startling awake several disciples. “You vile worm! Tonight, I’ll purge your filth!”

Ling Su froze, paling. He spun wildly, finding no source for Guan Yu’s voice. Disciples emerged, drawn by the commotion.

Guan Yu’s true body burst from his tent, storming toward Ling Su. “You think slaughtering camels won’t doom us all? If I hadn’t stopped you—”

“Replace Master? *Punish* me?” Ling Su sneered, though panic flickered.

The crowd arrived, witnessing Ling Su’s bloody dagger and the slain camel—marked as a Bamboo Peak disciple’s property. Outrage rippled through them.

“Explain this!” Guan Yu demanded. “That’s Senior Brother Cheng’s camel! Dreaming won’t save you now.”

Ling Su’s mind raced. Caught red-handed, denial faltered. Meanwhile, Guan Yu barked orders: “Secure the camels! Re-tether them before they scatter!”

“Why *my* camel?” Senior Brother Cheng cried, recognizing his slain beast.

Ling Su bristled. “So what if I killed it? Want a fight?”

“A camel’s death is trivial,” Guan Yu interjected coldly. “But as mission leader, I expel you, Ling Su. Leave now. Take nothing—the silver bought your gear. Senior Brother Cheng, claim Ling Su’s camel.”

Gasps erupted. Expelling a favored disciple of Elder Xuanming? Bold!

“You… you dare?” Ling Su sputtered.

“I do,” Guan Yu said. “With a saboteur among us, success is impossible. Go.”

Siqi approached, uneasy. “Perhaps… give him another chance?”

“No.” Guan Yu’s tone brooked no argument. “He’d have slaughtered every camel, cut tent ropes—left us for dead in storms. I intercepted him early. Anyone objecting, challenge me. By word or blade.”

**Chapter 4485: Grave Consequences**

Ling Su scoffed. “You accuse me of intentions? Where’s proof?”

“Your dagger drips blood. The camels’ ropes—cut. Need more?” Guan Yu’s gaze pierced him. “Leave. Now.”

As winds intensified, Guan Yu turned away. Ling Su, seething, vanished into the night. The disciples worked silently, securing camels under the storm’s wrath.

Guan Yu knew: this feud wasn’t over. But for now, the desert demanded their focus—and survival.
