“What’s called rotten luck?” Guan Yu grimaced, staring at the shattered porcelain vase on the floor, utterly speechless!

The ancient-looking ceramic urn perched atop the bookshelf had been jolted loose during the commotion, crashing to the ground in a shower of fragments!

He’d really done it this time. Guan Yu rubbed his nose sheepishly, shoulders slumping as he surveyed the wreckage. What now? Not only had he meddled with others’ belongings without permission, but he’d also destroyed their decorative piece!

Surely this couldn’t be too expensive… Guan Yu thought desperately. No one would keep truly valuable ceramics on an office shelf. His eyes darted toward the door—still empty. Could he slip away unnoticed?

But how could he repay the manly woman’s kindness in hiding him from the police by sneaking off like a thief? No, he’d have to face the music. At worst, he’d replace it with a finer vase. Resigned, Guan Yu braced himself.

**Chapter Sixty-Four: A Real Man Owes Up to His Actions**

As Guan Yu sank into a chair, Feng Xin entered with two elderly men.

“What happened earlier? Why were police here? Trouble?” demanded a white-haired but vigorous old man in a Zhongshan suit, his bearing radiating authority. Beside him stood a slightly younger gentleman with swept-back hair camouflaging a receding hairline.

Spotting Feng Xin’s return, Guan Yu rose awkwardly. “I—”

“The police are gone,” Feng Xin cut in coolly, her gaze following his gesture toward the debris.

“And this is…?” The Zhongshan-suited elder appraised Guan Yu curiously.

“He’s the one who injured Zhao Xu and Jiazi earlier,” Feng Xin remarked offhandedly before freezing—her eyes widening at the ceramic shards. “You…!”

“I… accidentally knocked it over,” Guan Yu stammered, face flushing.

Feng Xin’s brow furrowed. “You reached the top shelf?!”

“I’ll pay for it! Whatever it costs!” Guan Yu raised placating hands.

“Pay?” Feng Xin’s lips thinned. “Don’t forget the aquarium wall,盆栽plants, and billiard table you wrecked downstairs. Let’s tally everything.” She produced a calculator from her desk with surgical precision.

Guan Yu exchanged strained smiles with the elders. In his penniless state, this should’ve been catastrophic. But with his Detection Skill, lottery tickets could soon solve this…

“437,000 total. Cash or check?” Feng Xin leaned back, stony-faced.

“Four hundred thousand?!” Guan Yu choked. His eyes darted to the ceramic remains. This had to be extortion!

“Correct.” A ghost of triumph flickered across Feng Xin’s features. “That Song Dynasty ‘Golden Threads and Iron Lines’ urn cost 420,000 at auction.”

As Guan Yu gaped, the bespectacled elder exclaimed: “The第十四届联展auction piece? Ruined?!”

“Precisely, Grandfather Xu.” Feng Xin’s stare pinned Guan Yu like a specimen.

The Zhongshan-suited grandfather studied both young people with growing intrigue. His fiery granddaughter tolerating this chaos? Unprecedented. Normally, offenders would’ve been fed to her bodyguards by now. Unless…

A sly smile crept over the old man’s face. Could this scamp be the reason his headstrong girl was acting so… uncharacteristically docile?

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s Detection Skill flared. The urn’s appraisal data glowed in his mind. Relief washed over him. “This isn’t Song Dynasty! It’s a Republican-era imitation!”

“How dare you question experts?!” Grandfather Xu spluttered.

Guan Yu lifted a shard. “See the uneven glaze? Flimsy clay body? Modern replication.”

After tense examination, the elders exchanged uneasy glances. “Perhaps… further authentication is needed,” Grandfather Xu conceded.

With the vase’s value slashed to 20,000, Guan Yu sighed. “I’ll pay the rest later—”

“Your ID isn’t collateral,” Feng Xin snapped. Then her eyes narrowed craftily. “But since you hospitalized my guards… work as my bodyguard for two months. Consider it restitution.”

“What?!”

“Or pay 437,000 now.”

Trapped, Guan Yu groaned. Thus began his indentured servitude.

After exchanging contacts, Guan Yu fled—only to encounter the elders again in the elevator.

“Join us for a bath, lad?” The Zhongshan-suited grandfather grinned like a conspiring Buddha.

In the spa, the old man appraised Guan Yu’s physique. “Untrained brawler’s build. Want to test your skills?” He thumped his chest. “Hit me!”

“I don’t beat elders!” Guan Yu protested.

“What if this elder beats you?” The octogenarian’s eyes sparkled with challenge.
