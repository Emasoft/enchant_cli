“Now, leave your weapons and get out of my house. Go back and tell those old bats that if I hear of another vampire killing in the East, don’t blame me for storming the Western Dark Council someday. Remember my words, or else don’t say I, Guan Yu, didn’t warn you. Get lost…” With a wave of Guan Yu’s hand, the vampire named Velen was violently hurled out, followed by the loud slam of the door.

“Hahaha… Just when I needed a pillow, here comes one! This dagger is actually a key to a Demon Sect relic. Sect Master, your Crimson Flame Blood Mushroom is within reach.” Qin Wuliang laughed heartily within the mountain gates. What he thought was a trivial task had yielded unexpected gains—nothing could be better.

**Chapter 207: Ancient Demon Sect**

“Placing this dagger in the groove allows entry? Elder Qin, what exactly is this relic key about?” Guan Yu gently inserted the dagger into a recess. Black light enveloped him, and in the next instant, he appeared in another world.

The azure sky bore streaks of crimson. Upon arriving, Guan Yu immediately sensed the Demon Subduing True Energy within him boiling like water—this place radiated hostile energy.

“Truly a demonic land. Yet this is also our Demon Subduing Sect’s sacred ground. Sect Master, fully activate the Great Demon Subduing Scripture and summon Jing San and that Blood Asura for protection.” Qin Wuliang’s voice carried solemnity. The Demon Subduing Sect stood as the most peculiar faction in the cultivation world.

Its peculiarity lay in its sworn enmity toward demons while simultaneously using them as nourishment. Demonic energy, which could corrupt artifacts, taint souls, and even turn cultivators into demons, became vital sustenance for the sect. The Great Demon Subduing Scripture could convert any demonic energy into pure True Energy, a legacy from the ancient Golden Immortal Demon Subduer who feuded with the Demon Ancestor Blood River Patriarch and later Demon Sect leader Chi You.

Guan Yu’s first cultivation session here lasted eighty-one minor cycles converging into a major cycle. When he reopened his eyes, his true energy had surged by an entire tier—a terrifying rate of growth. If this continued…

“Sect Master, such progress only happens once. Subsequent gains won’t match this.” Qin Wuliang’s voice echoed in Guan Yu’s mind, tinged with amusement. He understood this phase well, having experienced it himself.

“Old Blood, keep watch as usual. Alert me immediately if anything arises. Elder Qin, I leave the array-breaking to you. Jing San, let’s move.” Guan Yu exhaled deeply, savoring the exhilarating sensation of power coursing through his veins—an addictive feeling surpassing any earthly pleasure.

“According to Demon Sect records, this should be one of the ancient Heavenly Demon Sect’s domains. Though reduced to fragments after the Primordial Shattering, it still spans three to four thousand li. Let me scout our path.” Qin Wuliang materialized beside Guan Yu. While his power was restricted in the mortal realm, here his Mahayana-stage divine sense could instantly survey the entire territory.

“Head seven hundred li east—a medicinal garden lies there. En route, demonic beasts and corpses can be fed to our sect’s Primal Chaos Demon Refining Array. Leave none.” With that, Qin Wuliang vanished, avoiding direct combat.

Guan Yu smirked but didn’t object. Combat wasn’t instinctual—even elite disciples honed their skills through countless duels. To master battle, one must practice.

“Awooo…” Within twenty li, Guan Yu halted before a horde of crimson demon wolves. Though individually weak—the strongest at peak Silent Spirit stage, weakest below Heart Movement stage—their numbers gave pause.

“A thousand at least?” Guan Yu inhaled sharply at the sea of crimson fur. Despite their low cultivation, the overwhelming swarm made retreat tempting.

“Heh, perfect for testing myself. Come, beasts!” A purple sword flashed from his spatial ring. Guan Yu shot forward like an arrow, plunging into the pack.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Flesh-rending sounds echoed as Guan Yu danced through the horde, sword gleaming and feet blazing with violet light. Soon, his robes hung in tatters, drenched in blood.

“Pah! Demonic beasts indeed—they even cast spells…” Wrenching a wolf’s head off, Guan Yu realized his Cloud Body Wind Form hadn’t fully defended against claws imbued with bloody energy. The pack’s coordinated attacks hinted at an alpha’s command.

“Damn it! Seven Stars Convergence!” Guan Yu levitated, his sword splitting into seven stellar blades that crashed down like falling stars.

“Awooo…”

The wolf tide retreated as Guan Yu panted mid-air—victory through aerial bombardment felt hollow.

***

“Huff… Elder Qin, I’m spent.” For the first time since entering cultivation, Guan Yu felt truly overwhelmed. Despite his Golden Core mid-stage cultivation and gravity domain, he’d lasted mere fifteen minutes.

“You’ve done well, Sect Master. Enduring such carnage without breaking proves exceptional talent. Jing San, gather these corpses. Their blood and bones are alchemical ingredients.” When Qin Wuliang reappeared, his gaze held newfound respect.

After half a month, Guan Yu radiated killing intent so intense it startled newly emerged Liu Shilei. Yet days later, after decapitating a demonic blood ape, the crimson light in his eyes faded, restoring his usual lazy demeanor.

**Chapter 208: Nine Revolutions Profound Art**

“No wonder ancient Demon Sect ruins remain untouched—these demonic creatures swarm endlessly. At my level, survival alone is challenging, let alone gaining benefits.” A month later, Guan Yu watched roving beasts from Liu Shilei’s protective array.

The projected seven-day journey had stretched to a month covering barely a hundred li. Clad in Qin Wuliang’s crafted armor and sustained by Beast Blood Essence Pills—foundational elixirs for the sect’s Nine Revolutions Profound Art body cultivation—Guan Yu pondered his path.

“Will switching to Nine Revolutions cause conflicts?” He examined the first layer of the legendary technique. Though only the initial stage, this peerless body refinement method supposedly surpassed all others.

“None whatsoever. All Daoist body arts derive from this source. With your Cloud Body foundation, you’ll master the first revolution swiftly.” Qin Wuliang’s pride was evident.

“Let’s test this ‘Primordial’s Finest Body Art.’” Guan Yu smiled wryly, his body pushed to limits—muscles aching, meridians burning despite Cloud Body’s efforts.

“Ah!”

“Hiss…” As the Nine Revolutions activated, his energy drained into a vortex. Muscles felt shattered and reforged while the Beast Blood pill’s warmth soothed the agony—a torturous yet clarifying process.

Fifteen minutes later, Guan Yu emerged transformed.

Crash!

A punch sent a barrel-thick tree trunk flying through seven others. “Five-ox pure physical strength?” He stared at his fist in disbelief.

“Five thousand jin is merely the beginning. Cloud Body’s simplicity lacks the Nine Revolutions’ divine abilities. Remember—no divine technique means no true Dao.” Qin Wuliang’s guidance remained sparse but precise.

“Let’s test this in battle.” Energy thrummed in Guan Yu’s veins.

Bam!

A collision with a Bloody Demon Ape sent the beast flying. Eighteen punches later, the ape lay dead with shattered organs, Guan Yu’s arms throbbing with micro-fractures.

“Sect Master, you…” Qin Wuliang sighed.

“Haha! Don’t scold. Shilei, another concealment array please. Ling’er, your healing again.” Guan Yu released two girls. Mo Ling’s green healing light bathed his arms as life energy flowed.

“Wait!” Guan Yu’s expression shifted—surprise then elation. “Elder Qin, is this…”

“Correct. The first revolution grants Indestructible Body—self-healing that evolves to blood-drop regeneration. Our sect’s pride.”

Before Guan Yu could revel, Old Blood materialized, reeking of gore. “Master… intruders.”

“Two Nascent Soul, eighteen Golden Core cultivators—including Yin Qianjun.”

Guan Yu’s tongue flicked over lips. “Two Nascent Souls? Excellent fodder for our arrays.” His bloodthirsty grin mirrored weeks of carnage.

**Chapter 209: Demon Sect’s Arrival**

Tracking confirmed Guan Yu’s suspicion. “They’re following my path. Did they mark me?”

“Indeed. The records contained demonic insect secretions—month-long tracking.” Qin Wuliang stated matter-of-factly. Sect Masters must face trials alone.

“Two early Nascent Souls. Manageable.” This would be Guan Yu’s toughest battle yet—against Demon Sect elites, not half-starved stragglers.

Meanwhile, the Demon Sect group advanced smoothly, some jeering:

“Guan Yu, the ‘Unfailing Strategist,’ reduced to our pathfinder!”

“Thanks to the Yin brothers! Without them…”

“Is Guan Yu truly formidable? He seems mediocre—maybe a propaganda puppet?”

Amidst mockery, Yin Qianjun concealed his disdain. These fools didn’t grasp what challenging昆仑 (Kunlun) to retrieve Ye Qingling truly meant.

Roars and bellows echoed as demonic beasts tested the newcomers—their real trial just beginning.
