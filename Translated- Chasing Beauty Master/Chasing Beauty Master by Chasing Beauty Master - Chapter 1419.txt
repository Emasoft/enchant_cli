“Magistrate Zhou’s approach gave Guan Yu an idea. Soon after, Yue Gao happened to walk over. Guan Yu said, “Yue Gao, I think it’s time to wrap this up. We just need to ask each of them one question. Whoever lies will undoubtedly be the killer.”

“Oh? What should we ask? Nothing happened last night, right?” Yue Gao inquired curiously.

“You’ve forgotten—last night, you had a nightmare.”

Yue Gao suddenly remembered, clapping his hands in excitement. “Right! I did forget that. But I screamed so loudly last night—surely everyone heard it. The whole temple must have. Wouldn’t that make this approach unreliable?”

Guan Yu, who already understood the killer’s methods, knew someone must not have heard due to the roaring waterfall. “Just follow my plan. Let’s start with Ah Wu (Fifth).” As Guan Yu spoke, he instructed Yue Gao to summon Ah Wu, who was still being questioned by Magistrate Zhou.

When Yue Gao brought Ah Wu over, the latter said, “Why have you called me here? I hope you three leave soon. You’re the ones who attracted the Heavenly Dog. If you stay, none of us will survive.”

Ah Wu remained adamant about the Heavenly Dog’s involvement. Guan Yu smiled. “We’d like to leave, but the yamen officials have labeled us suspects. We can’t go until this is resolved. However, I want to ask—do you recall Yue Gao’s nightmare last night? You ran over to check before fleeing. You haven’t forgotten, have you?”

“Of course not. Patron Yue Gao must have dreamed of the Heavenly Dog—a dire omen.” Ah Wu replied distractedly.

Guan Yu noted Ah Wu’s superstitious terror but dismissed him as a suspect, since Master Qiu had already been killed when Yue Gao screamed.

Next, Ah Huo (Fire) was summoned. Guan Yu asked directly, “Ah Huo, you claimed to have chanted sutras all night until dawn. Correct?”

“Yes. Is that a problem? I meditated and recited scriptures without leaving my room. Though it’s no alibi, that’s the truth.”

Ah Huo, unshaken by suspicion, stood firm. Guan Yu pressed, “Did you hear any noises last night?”

“None at all.” Ah Huo scratched his bald head, pretending to recall. “It was quiet—no unusual sounds.”

Guan Yu feigned surprise. If Ah Huo hadn’t heard Yue Gao’s scream—inaudible near the waterfall—he might be the killer. “Thank you for your cooperation,” Guan Yu said, exchanging a meaningful glance with Yue Gao.

As Ah Huo turned to leave, he suddenly added, “Wait! I did hear Patron Yue Gao’s scream around midnight. But fearing the Heavenly Dog, I stayed in my room.”

“Really? When exactly did you hear it?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Shortly after the hour of the Rat. Later, I also heard Senior Brother Ah Wu making noise.”

Guan Yu nodded. The rooms were arranged: Ah Huo’s at the edge, followed by Ah Xiao (Little)’s, Ah Wu’s, Yue Gao’s, then Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong’s. Master Qiu’s room was on the second floor.

“Ah Huo, you’re not the killer,” Guan Yu concluded. “This was murder, not the Heavenly Dog’s work.”

“Murder? But Master’s death mirrors Ah Gong’s three years ago—even the hole in the wall is identical! Only the Heavenly Dog could create such a hole or reach a ten-meter beam!”

“Ah Gong’s death also had a hole? A human would need hours to carve it. Hence the Heavenly Dog tale?”

“Exactly! Who else could do it? The hole was repaired, yet it reappeared now. If not the Heavenly Dog, who?”

Yue Gao interjected, “Ah Huo, if someone didn’t hear my scream, they’re likely the killer.”

“What? How?” Ah Huo stammered.

Before he could respond, Ah Xiao approached, expressionless. “Senior Brother Ah Huo, the yamen concludes Master committed suicide. Shouldn’t we prepare his funeral?”

“These detectives are still investigating,” Ah Huo said.

Guan Yu questioned Ah Xiao, “You claimed to have copied sutras all night until the hour of the Rabbit. Correct?”

“Yes. I can show you the scriptures if you doubt me.”

Though Ah Xiao feigned calm, Guan Yu noticed his shifting gaze. “Did you hear any noises?”

“No. It was quiet. Are you suspecting me?” Ah Xiao glanced at Ah Huo. “The yamen advises labeling it suicide to avoid panic.”

Yue Gao pressed, “Think carefully. Heard nothing?”

Ah Xiao shook his head. Ah Huo exclaimed, “Ah Xiao! You didn’t hear the scream?”

Ah Xiao hastily corrected, “Oh! I did—around the hour of the Tiger. This lady screamed.” He pointed at Wang Xiaorong, laughing nervously.

Ah Huo gaped. “Ah Xiao… did you kill Master?”

Guan Yu’s group stared. Ah Xiao’s lie—claiming Wang Xiaorong screamed—exposed him. “Gather everyone in the warehouse,” Guan Yu ordered.

Convincing Magistrate Zhou, Guan Yu addressed the crowd: “Master Qiu was murdered. The killer exploited the warehouse’s sealed door and oiled walls. No ladder could fit inside, and the beam’s dust showed no footprints. Master was strangled in his room, then hung here. The killer—Ah Xiao—left mud on his shoes from stalking us downhill.”

Ah Xiao confessed, snarling, “That old fool killed my brother three years ago! The yamen ignored me. I had to avenge him!”

“Vengeance breeds endless cycles,” Guan Yu said. “You could’ve sought justice lawfully.”

“The yamen is useless!” Ah Xiao spat. Magistrate Zhou flushed with shame.

“Thanks to Guan Yu, the truth prevails,” Zhou conceded. “A lesson in diligence for us all.””
