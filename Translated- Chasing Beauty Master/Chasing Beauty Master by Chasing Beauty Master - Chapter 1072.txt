“After receiving the street report, I arrived here with officers intending to take that man and woman to the station for questioning. But perhaps because they’d offended someone who wanted them dead, we came under gunfire as soon as we reached this area. The casino manager should know those two.”

Lin Qiaoqiao nodded, though a suspicion flickered in her mind. While many couples roamed the city streets, few would encounter such targeted violence. The image of Guan Yu and Xue Jing materialized in her thoughts – she couldn’t imagine anyone else provoking such intense gunfire.

Still, proper procedure demanded thorough investigation. If it truly involved Guan Yu, she believed he’d contact her. Even if he didn’t, she trusted his capability to handle crises. “Summon the casino manager for questioning,” Lin ordered. Officer Yu scurried inside, soon emerging with the hulking figure of Ju Niu (Giant Bull).

“Do you know the couple involved in the casino altercation? Did they actually assault someone?” Lin asked, her phrasing subtly protective as she mentally connected the dots to Guan Yu.

Ju Niu maintained his practiced neutrality. “There was indeed a scuffle, but your officers already took them away. Whatever happened outside isn’t our concern.”

“It becomes your concern when bullets fly nearby,” Lin countered sharply.

The casino manager shrugged. “Street incidents don’t involve our establishment.”

“We’re establishing context, not assigning blame. Cooperate with the investigation,” Lin stated flatly, her badge granting authority.

Chapter 2741: Refusing to Confess at All Costs

Though momentarily dazzled by Lin’s striking presence in uniform, Ju Niu remained composed. “The couple came to gamble. Two patrons harassed the woman due to her looks. When she resisted, they escalated to attempted abduction. She injured one aggressor in self-defense. The remaining man in the black tank top called police, who removed the couple. Beyond that, I know nothing.”

Lin’s brow furrowed. “Officers removed them without questioning witnesses?”

“Precisely,” Ju Niu confirmed.

Officer Yu bristled. “Don’t slander us! I questioned the complainant and confirmed assault before making arrests!”

Lin’s gaze turned piercing. She knew Yu’s history of favoring local troublemakers – particularly those lining his pockets. The manager’s earlier discreet envelope exchange with Yu hadn’t escaped her notice.

As Ju Niu pressed about casino non-involvement, Lin wheeled on Yu. “Did you properly document events? The sequence could be crucial!”

Yu’s neck reddened. “The injured required hospitalization. Regardless of provocation, assault occurred. Standard procedure demanded their removal.”

“Standard procedure ignores aggressors and skips witness statements?” Lin retorted icily. “Show me the surveillance footage.”

Chapter 2742: The Unforeseen Revelation

The grainy monitors revealed Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s confrontation – the bald man’s provocation, Xue’s defensive strikes, Yu’s blatant collusion with the tank-topped instigator. Lin’s glare could have melted steel. “This is your ‘thorough questioning,’ Officer Yu? A silent understanding with the accuser?”

Yu studied his shoes as footage showed Guan’s group exiting. External cameras captured the ambush: a black sedan spraying bullets as officers dove for cover. Lin zeroed in on fallen assailants. “Explain these armed men near your patrol car, Yu.”

Sweat beaded on Yu’s temple. “The tank top’s reinforcements, caught in crossfire. That’s all I know.”

Lin’s priority shifted. Dialing Guan Yu’s number, she hissed, “Where are you? Your car’s here!”

“Watching you right now,” Guan’s chuckle carried through the receiver. “The shooters came from Fang Su’s estate. That spineless worm you almost married? He’s grown teeth.”

“Impossible! Fang’s a coward!” Lin protested.

“Backed by new allies. Move now before evidence disappears.”

As Lin mobilized units, Guan coordinated his own forces. Tonight would end Fang family ambitions – regardless of their mysterious patrons.

“Keep your pistol hidden,” Lin warned before disconnecting. She’d recognized the Desert Eagle’s distinctive shell casings.

Guan surveyed the city through night-vision binoculars. His alliance of gangsters, foreign operatives, and fresh recruits stood ready. Fang Su’s mansion glowed in the distance – a beacon marking tonight’s final reckoning.

Unseen behind him, headlights flickered in an alley. A tail since the casino? Guan smiled coldly. Let them watch. By dawn, all challengers would understand the price of crossing him.
