After the wine and dishes were served, Guan Yu leisurely began eating, finding the flavors quite commendable. It must be said, the chefs of this tavern truly mastered the trifecta of culinary excellence—presentation, aroma, and taste—with each dish carrying its own distinctive savor.

As for the wine, though touted as aged vintage, Guan Yu privately compared it to the renowned Daughter’s Red from Wanyang Tavern and found it slightly inferior.

Casually finishing his meal, Guan Yu pocketed the hundred-tael silver note on the table and rose to leave. A waiter hurried after him, calling out, “Honored guest, you’ve dined well, but you haven’t settled the bill yet.”

**Chapter 4832: Dining and Dashing**

“What did you say?” Guan Yu whirled around, fury blazing across his face as he glared at the waiter. “I already gave you a hundred taels and told you to keep the change! What nonsense are you spouting now?”

The waiter paled. “Sir, you never gave me any hundred taels. Such an accusation is beyond my station!”

“Bullshit! Is this some damned den of thieves?” Guan Yu roared, his voice rising. “Under the Emperor’s very nose, have you no fear of the law?”

His outburst drew the attention of every patron in the tavern, including those dining upstairs. All eyes turned to the commotion.

The waiter wrung his hands helplessly. Though Guan Yu had indeed produced a hundred-tael note earlier, he hadn’t accepted it immediately, intending to collect payment—and perhaps a generous tip—after the meal. Never had he expected the man to finish eating and attempt to leave without paying.

Amid the uproar, a man in his thirties emerged from the back—clearly a manager, judging by his attire. Guan Yu cared little for formalities. This establishment belonged to the Cao family, and his purpose today was to stir as much chaos as possible, ideally finding an excuse to wreck the place.

“What’s this disturbance?” the manager demanded, eyeing Guan Yu’s opulent robes and noble bearing—marks of high birth. “You’re disrupting our guests.”

Before the waiter could speak, Guan Yu shoved the servant forward and thundered, “Are you in charge here?”

“I am the proprietor,” the manager replied stiffly. “What grievance brings such fury to our doors?”

“You dare ask me?” Guan Yu jabbed a finger at the man’s face, feigning apoplectic rage. “This viper’s nest preys on outsiders, does it? I paid a hundred taels for my meal, yet your lackey demands payment again! Let all here judge—is this not a den of thieves?”

The manager frowned. Most patrons here were wealthy regulars; the tavern’s reputation couldn’t afford scandal. He suspected this stranger sought a free meal, but with witnesses present, brute force was inadvisable.

Turning to the waiter, he asked, “Explain yourself. The guest claims to have paid. Why pursue him?”

“He showed a hundred-tael note but never handed it over!” the waiter protested. “I intended to collect after his meal, but he tried to leave without paying!”

“Lies!” Guan Yu bellowed. “I gave the silver! Any decent tavern would charge twenty taels at most, yet you extort a hundred and still demand more!” He slammed a palm onto a nearby table, shattering the heavy oak into splinters. Patrons gasped as the manager and waiter recoiled.

Emboldened, Guan Yu kicked a chair across the room, smashing it against the doorframe. “Thieving dogs! Return my silver or I’ll reduce this cesspit to kindling!”

Six burly men emerged at the manager’s signal. “Destroying property complicates matters,” the manager warned coldly.

“Complicates?” Guan Yu laughed harshly. He produced a thick stack of silver notes and a pouch of gold leaves. “You think I need to swindle tavern scraps? Search your rat of a waiter—my hundred taels are in his clothes!”

As the crowd murmured approval of his apparent wealth, the manager reluctantly ordered the waiter searched. To everyone’s shock—including the waiter’s—a folded hundred-tael note fluttered from his loosened robes.

“There’s your proof!” Guan Yu seized the moment, hurling chairs and tables alike. “A den of thieves! I’ll see it razed!” Within minutes, the entire first floor lay in ruins—shattered furniture, smashed wine jars pooling liquor across the tiles.

The manager stood paralyzed as Guan Yu stormed out, bellowing, “Let this be a lesson!” His next target—a Cao-family cloth shop nearby—awaited similar treatment.

**Chapter 4833: Heartless Scoundrels**

Meanwhile, at the Cao estate, Lord Cao received successive reports: first his gambling den, now his premier tavern, destroyed. “Collective riot?” he thundered. “Who dares?!”

But Guan Yu was already elsewhere, plotting fresh chaos. At the lavish Cao Textile Emporium, where noblewomen flocked for silks and embroidery, he entered disguised as a merchant. As attendants hurried to serve this richly dressed client, none suspected the storm about to break.

**Chapter 4834: Orchestrated Mayhem**

Back at the tavern, the manager stared hollow-eyed at the wreckage. Patrons streamed out, spreading tales of the “shady establishment.” The waiter groveled apologies to empty air—Guan Yu long gone, silver recovered, new targets in sight.

Lord Cao’s roar echoed through his halls: “Find who’s behind this! I’ll have their head!” But Guan Yu, smiling coldly, melted into the bustling streets, a wolf amid sheep, his campaign of vengeance barely begun.
