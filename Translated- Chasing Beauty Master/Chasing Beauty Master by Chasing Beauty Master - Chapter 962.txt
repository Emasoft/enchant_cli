Now that Pan Xiaoxia had been notified, it was a last resort. Even if Guan Yu remained in danger, Pan Taisheng would never expose Jinhua’s whereabouts. If all else failed, he’d bring Guan Yu back to Qiaoyuan District alone. This was Pan Taisheng’s integrity—the bedrock of his reputation.

***

At this moment, Qiaoyuan District blazed with lights despite the late hour. No one had gone to sleep. Lü Mei and Zhang Han had stopped gaming, and everyone gathered in the living room, anxiously awaiting news of Guan Yu while brainstorming places he might have gone.

Yang Conghan was also in Qiaoyuan District. After questioning her family’s subordinates, she’d learned Guan Yu had last been seen at the Hua Ye Club two nights prior. He’d been tailed but later lost, vanishing without a trace since.

Jones had rushed to Qiaoyuan District that afternoon. Having heard nothing from Guan Yu for days, she’d grown worried about his safety and come seeking answers.

The district now resembled a gathering of legendary beauties—every stunning woman in the city had converged here. All waited fretfully in the hall, forming a dazzling spectacle. Even Lanyu had hurried over after hearing the news. Lin Qiaoqiao, burdened by guilt, lingered without leaving.

Xue Jing stood abruptly. “I can’t wait any longer. It’s been too long. We must inform the elder sisters—only their resources can find Guan Yu now. Let’s hope he’s just fooling around and not in danger.” She pulled out her phone to call Xu Jinglei.

Suddenly, her phone rang—Ling’er’s number.

“Ling’er, why call so late?” Xue Jing asked, assuming the girl was simply checking in out of concern.

“Guan Yu contacted me earlier. He’s out of town—his phone died, so he borrowed someone else’s to call. He wants everyone not to worry,” Ling’er explained.

“Where is he?!” Xue Jing’s explosive shout startled both Ling’er and every woman in the room.

“D-don’t be angry! Brother Guan knew you’d react this way. He’s safe, really! His phone died, and he only remembered my number by chance. He’ll call you once it’s charged and return in a couple days.” Ling’er’s strained attempt at lying was painfully transparent.

Xue Jing composed herself, chastened. “Thank you, Ling’er. Rest early.”

After hanging up, Zhang Han sauntered over. “So Guan Yu’s just gallivanting around?” she pouted.

**Chapter 2460: No More Pleading to Stay**

Despite the news, Xue Jing doubted Ling’er’s story. The holes were glaring. Why would Guan Yu call so late? If he wanted to report his safety, he’d have done so earlier or not at all. Knowing him, he’d never claim to only recall Ling’er’s number. Yet she couldn’t fathom Ling’er’s motive—unless Guan Yu was with her, using her to relay false reassurance. Regardless, the “news” offered temporary relief.

Truthfully, Xue Jing wasn’t overly worried. Guan Yu’s wit and combat skills usually shielded him from harm. Her current mood stemmed more from simmering frustration than fear for his safety.

“Since he’s fine, everyone should rest,” Xue Jing declared wearily, done with the drama.

Among Qiaoyuan District’s residents, only Lin Qiaoqiao and Jones lacked assigned rooms. Xue Jing surveyed the crowd and sighed. “It’s too late. Jones, Qiaoqiao—stay the night.”

As Amei moved to prepare rooms, Jones declined. “I’ll head back—urgent matters await. Now that we’ve heard from Guan Yu, there’s no need to stay.”

“Same here. Work tomorrow demands I sleep at home,” Lin Qiaoqiao added.

Xue Jing didn’t press them. “Jones, escort Qiaoqiao home. I don’t want her traveling alone at night.”

“Of course. I’ll ensure her safety,” Jones nodded.

As Qiaoyuan District quieted, Pan Taisheng faced a new crisis—one that left him utterly stumped.

“Brother Pan… Could your sister assist me to the restroom?” Jinhua’s request paralyzed him. Pan Xiaoxia was currently channeling energy to heal Guan Yu—unreachable. Yet as a man, helping Jinhua himself was unthinkable, especially since she was Guan Yu’s woman.

After agonizing deliberation, Pan Taisheng called Ling’er. She knew about Jinhua and could help without compromising secrets.

When Ling’er arrived minutes later, bloodstains on the floor alarmed her. “What happened here?!”

“No time—help me first.” Pan Taisheng carried Jinhua to the bathroom, leaving Ling’er to support her. Afterward, Ling’er confronted the truth in the south bedroom—Guan Yu lay deathly pale, drenched in blood. She stifled a scream, tears erupting.

**Chapter 2461: No Disturbances**

In the living room, Pan Taisheng explained: “When Xue Jing first called, I didn’t take it seriously. But after checking surveillance—Guan Yu hadn’t left Jinhua’s apartment for two days, with no food deliveries—I broke in. Found them both unconscious, no signs of struggle. Jinhua had bloody orifices—likely qi deviation. My sister’s treating him now. No one can interrupt.”

Ling’er wept. “Why not tell Xue Jing? She might have solutions!”

“By the time I considered moving him, Xiaoxia had already begun treatment. It’s too late.” Pan Taisheng ran a hand through his hair. “Exposing Jinhua risks Yang Family interference. Transporting Guan Yu now could worsen his condition.”

As dawn approached, neither Ling’er nor Pan Taisheng slept. When morning came, Ling’s dark circles betrayed her vigil. Pan Taisheng arranged caretakers for Jinhua so Ling’er could work without suspicion.

At 7 AM, the lights dimmed—Jinhua’s signal. Pan Taisheng carried her again, noting her regained voice. “You’re recovering well.”

“Thanks to you and Ling’er,” Jinhua smiled weakly. “How’s Guan Yu?”

“Same as you—restoring gradually,” Ling’er lied.

After Ling’er left for work, Pan Taisheng bought congee for Jinhua. By noon, exhaustion claimed them both—until a faint voice stirred Pan Taisheng.

“Brother…”

Pan Xiaoxia lay drenched in sweat beside Guan Yu, barely conscious. “It’s done… He’ll recover…” she gasped.
