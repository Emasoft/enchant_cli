Guan Yu stood silently by, listening to their argument without interjecting. At this moment, he felt it best to remain quiet, lest his words provoke unintended consequences.

Wang Xiaorong declared, “Father, these concerns of yours are trivial. Consider this—we cultivators enjoy extended lifespans and prolonged youth. But Guan Yu’s other women are ordinary mortals. Their time with him will last mere decades at most. Once those years pass, he’ll belong to me alone.”

The Demon Lord shot Wang Xiaorong a disapproving look, astonished by her reasoning. Though her logic held a thread of validity, it remained a flimsy excuse at best. “You overthink matters. But can you guarantee Guan Yu won’t seek other women during this period? If he continues pursuing others, he’ll never be yours alone.”

“He won’t. Besides, all his previous relationships began before we met. From now on, I’ll eliminate any woman who approaches him. Rest assured, Father—I’ll permit no rivals.” Wang Xiaorong spoke with unwavering confidence.

Guan Yu nearly interrupted her. While he disagreed with her possessive stance—who could predict when another admirer might appear?—he refrained from objecting. With the Demon Lord present, it was wiser to humor her for now and navigate this confrontation first.

“Enough. I’ve no desire to argue further. Since you two are determined, I’ll say no more. But remember—fire cannot be wrapped in paper. Yunqing Sect will eventually discover Guan Yu, and when they do, grave danger will follow,” the Demon Lord warned.

Guan Yu recognized the genuine concern behind these words. “Lord Demon, I’m no fool. By the time Yunqing Sect moves against me, my cultivation may have advanced enough to resist them. Even if they seek my life, they’ll find it no easy task. Still, I pray they don’t uncover me prematurely. Currently, I lack both the strength to oppose them and the means to escape.”

“Guan Yu,” Wang Xiaorong urged, “why return? Come to the Demon Soul Sect with me. As the consort of our young mistress, you’ll face no opposition. Within our ranks, you’ll move unchallenged.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “I cannot. My studies at Yunqing Sect are crucial. Their techniques counteract the seal in my mind. Remaining there benefits my cultivation immensely. Trust me—I’m no loyal disciple. Neither of you need fear betrayal. I’ll never reveal your secrets to Yunqing Sect. Whether Xuan Ming views me as a tool matters not—so long as I master their arts.”

Wang Xiaorong had long informed her father that Guan Yu differed from brainwashed sect disciples. Unlike those raised since childhood within Yunqing’s walls, Guan Yu had joined mere months prior. Indoctrination required time he hadn’t yet endured.

**Chapter 3645: You’re Lucky**

Guan Yu’s circumstances differed entirely. His stay at Yunqing Sect served a singular purpose—to cultivate until he could shatter the seal imprisoning his memories and former power. This remained his driving ambition.

“Father,” Wang Xiaorong added, “Guan Yu once told me a demonic envoy placed that seal. It doesn’t just suppress his cultivation—it erased all his past memories.”

“Memory suppression?” The Demon Lord’s brow furrowed. “A demonic seal capable of that? Guan Yu, how did you cross paths with beings from the demonic realm?”

“A lengthy tale from my home plane. I clashed with demonic forces long ago,” Guan Yu replied.

“Your entire cultivation was sealed?”

“Initially, only partially. Later, I attempted to break the seal through risky experimentation. The backlash caused the seal to absorb all my internal energy, reducing me to this state.” Guan Yu paused. “Perhaps this absorption allowed me to pursue immortal cultivation, becoming what you call a dual practitioner.”

“Divine coincidence? Or sheer luck? What level had you reached as a martial cultivator?” the Demon Lord pressed.

“Peak Realm Sovereign.” Guan Yu’s four-word answer struck like thunder.

The Demon Lord inhaled sharply. “Peak Realm Sovereign? You jest! Such power at your age? Though unfamiliar with martial ranks, I know that tier’s fearsome reputation. How could one so mighty be sealed?”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “What gain lies in falsehood here? The demon I slew matched my power. With its dying breath, it cast this seal. Our battle left me unconscious—I awoke already diminished.”

“Incredible. A youth possessing such might... Were your seal broken, your restored power would terrify realms.” The Demon Lord’s tone shifted approvingly. “My daughter chose well. A dual-cultivation prodigy destined for greatness. Pity you aren’t of the Demon Soul Sect.”

**Chapter 3646: Astonishment**

“Father, must you revisit this?” Wang Xiaorong chided. “Guan Yu belongs to himself alone. He cultivates at Yunqing Sect for enlightenment, not allegiance.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Should conflict arise between our sects, I vow never to aid Yunqing against you.”

“You see, Father? Guan Yu uses their sect as shelter—a grand tree offering shade. There he’ll cultivate until breaking free.” Though the Demon Lord acknowledged this, frustration lingered. Guan Yu’s neutral stance—neither ally nor enemy—defied categorization.

As servants brought wine and dishes, the Demon Lord raised his cup. “Let us drink.” After toasts were exchanged, he probed anew: “If I secured Yunqing’s cultivation manuals, would you join us?”

Guan Yu’s silence spoke volumes. Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Father! We agreed not to press this!”

With a chuckle, Guan Yu deflected: “Yunqing guards its secrets jealously. Even if you obtained fragments, they’d be elementary. Their arts progress slowly—far inferior to your demonic techniques.”

“True,” the Demon Lord conceded. “My agents acquire only basic manuals. Yunqing’s methods don’t suit me. What galls me is Xuan Ming wielding the Hidden Dragon Sword while I lack the Eight-Sided Drum Art. With it, I could rival him.”

**Chapter 3647: Feast**

“Precisely. The Eight-Sided Drum’s first chapter already resides within me—unknown to Yunqing Sect,” Guan Yu revealed.

“You owe our silence for that,” the Demon Lord reminded. “Had Xuan Ming discovered this during your trial at Tiger Peak Hall...”

“I’m aware. The Saint Beast Scale test nearly exposed me. I’ve told no one, fearing repercussions.”

The Demon Lord smiled thinly. “I hold many cards against you. Revealing your secrets would see Yunqing destroy you without my lifting a finger.”

Guan Yu met his gaze steadily. “You won’t. Such betrayal gains you nothing and would turn your daughter against you eternally. I’ve sworn never to oppose the Demon Soul Sect—a promise made when I chose Xiaorong.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded fervently. “You see, Father? All is settled.”

“My concern lies elsewhere,” the Demon Lord mused. “A former Peak Realm Sovereign’s presence could upheave our world. Such power hasn’t surfaced in eras. Yet...” He studied Guan Yu skeptically. “Your physique contradicts martial mastery. In our lands, cultivators require robust frames. You appear... unremarkable.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “My homeland differs. There, cultivators are rare—most are ordinary folk living peaceful lives. Our society lacks this realm’s turbulence.”

“No immortal practitioners? Impossible! Your plane must lack spiritual energy,” the Demon Lord concluded.

“Elder Jiu of Yunqing visited decades past. He deemed my world’s spiritual energy too sparse for cultivation. Hence, martial arts dominate there.”

Nodding, the Demon Lord pondered aloud: “Different planes, different energies. Your Peak Realm Sovereigns—were they numerous?”

Wang Xiaorong interjected: “His bodyguard Jin Ci possesses at least First-Class Sovereign strength!”

“Jin Ci ranks among skilled assassins back home—not uncommon, yet respected,” Guan Yu clarified.

The Demon Lord chuckled. “So your ‘mighty’ warriors flee here? It seems your realm’s prowess is overstated.”

“We rely more on technological weapons than raw strength,” Guan Yu began, then halted—explaining advanced concepts to cultivation-era minds proved futile. As anticipated, the Demon Lord’s curiosity surged anew, mirroring his daughter’s insatiable thirst for knowledge.
