The competition commenced with a gaunt young man taking the stage, dressed in garments only marginally better than commoners' attire—their sole distinction being the absence of patches. Facing him stood a Zhao family retainer towering a full head taller, now shirtless to reveal rock-like muscles that rippled intimidatingly beneath his skin.

Chapter 4390: Unyielding Resolve

From Guan Yu's vantage point, the spectacle resembled a ravenous gorilla confronting a lost hare. The youth's fragile frame suggested his skull might shatter from a single blow. Many spectators doubted this skeletal challenger could survive even restrained combat as promised.

"This is absurd!" Wang Jun muttered. "That hulking retainer? I wouldn't dare face him myself." His earlier enthusiasm for claiming the gold prize waned visibly.

Guan Yu analyzed calmly, "He's merely a bodybuilder—all brawn without internal energy. Avoid direct hits, and he's harmless." Though Wang Jun lacked qi himself, his combat experience might prove advantageous against the slow-moving giant.

The crowd jeered, urging the youth to withdraw: "Don't waste your life for silver!" "One finger could crush you!" Yet the challenger stood firm, adopting a defensive stance. "I'll test my luck," he declared. "Wasn't this meant to be non-lethal?"

Patriarch Zhao stroked his beard amusedly from his elevated seat. "Ah Xiong—mind your strength," he cautioned, though confidence radiated from every syllable. The patriarch's daughter Zhao Xue sat veiled nearby, her expression inscrutable.

As Ah Xiong lumbered forward, Guan Yu noted his sluggish movements—pure muscle without qi's enhancement. Wang Jun scoffed, "Is he deliberately holding back? Even fools wouldn't stand for such telegraphed strikes!"

"His bulk restricts speed," Guan Yu explained. "Raw power, yes, but no finesse. You might outmaneuver him."

When Ah Xiong swung his boulder-like fist, the youth dodged nimbly, attempting joint locks on the retainer's tree-trunk arms—to no avail. The giant shook him off like a bothersome insect, yet the challenger retaliated with two audacious slaps across Ah Xiong's face.

Gasping spectators murmured, "The fool's courting death!" True to predictions, Ah Xiong hurled him toward the stage's edge—only for the youth to clamp his legs around the giant's neck in a desperate grapple.

Chapter 4391: Kowtow of Desperation

The combatants' bizarre dance continued—monkey versus mountain. Exhaustion drenched the youth as his futile blows pattered against Ah Xiong's impervious frame. Finally, centrifugal force dislodged him, sending his body crashing onto the boards.

"Victory to Ah Xiong!" declared the Zhao steward. As attendants moved to remove the defeated youth, he suddenly kowtowed to Patriarch Zhao with resounding thuds. "I seek no gold! Grant me Zhao Xue's hand!"

The patriarch's composure cracked. "Our rules demand martial merit, not beggary!" Guards intervened, dragging away the persistent suitor. Zhao Xue remained statue-still, offering neither recognition nor pity.

"Bold, but misguided," Guan Yu remarked to Siqi leaning on his shoulder. "Courage alone can't breach these gates."

Wang Jun speculated, "Perhaps they're acquainted?"

"Unrequited infatuation," scoffed A Ze. "See how the lady ignores him? The defeated have no claim."

When challenged about her connection to the youth, Zhao Xue coldly retorted, "Father, this was your associate's son—I rejected him months ago." The public admonishment revealed much about their familial dynamics—a doting father and willful daughter.

As the competition resumed, A Ze hesitated despite Wang Jun's prodding: "Try your spells! The rules don't forbid mystic arts!"

Guan Yu encouraged, "If fate smiles, I'll have Sect Leader Zheng bless your union." Before A Ze could decide, a new challenger emerged—a rag-clad wanderer reeking of alcohol, a gnarled staff slung across his shoulders.

The Zhao steward attempted diplomacy: "Honorable sir, accept gold and spare us this spectacle."

The vagabond grinned through matted hair. "Where's the sport in that? I'll earn my drink properly." His eyes gleamed with hidden sharpness beneath the grime—a wolf in beggar's guise.
