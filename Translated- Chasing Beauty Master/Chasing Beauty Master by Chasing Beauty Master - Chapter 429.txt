Observing the women's concern for Guan Yu, Zheng Chaoyang, Qin Tian, and Wang Sibin burned with jealousy, wishing they could throw him out. Chen Si shot Wen Ya a curious glance - why hadn't this girl mentioned Guan Yu had so many girlfriends?

Wen Ya silently studied Guan Yu, wondering what charm he possessed to attract both her and these stunning beauties.

"Let's hear your rules!" Zheng Chaoyang leaned back in his chair with false bravado as drinks arrived.

"Simple - straight from the bottle." Guan Yu had no patience for sipping games.

"You sure?"

"What? Scared?" Guan Yu countered.

"Bring it!" Though nervous about his first bottle-chugging contest, Zheng Chaoyang grabbed the vodka and gulped desperately.

"How manly!" Guan Yu clapped mockingly, his tone laced with sarcasm.

"Stop yapping! Your turn!"

Guan Yu swirled his bottle lazily. "Patience. Good drinking requires composure."

Zheng Chaoyang nearly spat out his mouthful. "You bastard tricked me!"

"Did I force you? You wanted to show your turtle-like perseverance." Guan Yu shrugged. "Though that sip was disappointingly small."

"Zheng, stop humiliating yourself. This coward won't compete!" Qin Tian sneered.

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. "If I finish and win, will you streak naked?"

Qin Tian hesitated. Having barely known Zheng Chaoyang, he couldn't gauge the man's alcohol tolerance.

"Brother Qin, I'll lose respect if you back down." Zhao Jing'er's sweet smile trapped him.

"Fine! If you win, I'll streak through the streets!" Qin Tian resolved to cheat later if needed.

Wang Sibin interjected coolly, "Making two suffer for one man's contest seems unfair." His implication pushed for teaming against Guan Yu.

Qin Tian brightened. "Dare face both of us?"

Guan Yu gazed at them like insects. "I'll take all three."

"Don't boast, youngster." Wang Sibin's corporate CEO demeanor hid his scheming nature. Though middle-aged, he preferred subtle manipulation - now tricking Guan Yu into a three-against-one match.

But Guan Yu saw through the ploy. Unfazed by vodka, he'd once chugged entire buckets of 65% erguotou liquor. This watered-down glucose held no fear.

"Since three challenge one, let's raise the stakes." Never one to lose advantage, Guan Yu demanded: "If I lose, I disappear forever. If you lose... collective naked sprint!"

He envisioned their humiliation - internet fame from posting nude photos of these local celebrities.

Chapter 1073: A Domineering Victory

As the trio hesitated, Guan Yu taunted: "Chickening out?"

"Fuck you! Deal!" Hot-headed Zheng Chaoyang bit first. Qin Tian and Wang Sibin reluctantly nodded.

"We'll be merciful," Wang Sibin lied. "Just have these girls sign with my agency if you lose." His plan combined profit and perversion.

Guan Yu's smile chilled those who knew him - storm warnings. Liu Shilei urged departure, but their exit was blocked.

"Settle debts first." Guan Yu's voice turned glacial.

Wang Sibin threatened: "Know your place, boy. Beijing eats prideful-"

"Reneging?" Guan Yu's hand tightened on a bottle.

The confrontation shattered when Qin Tian returned with two newcomers. A fiftyish man bowed obsequiously: "Young Master Guan! I'm Tang Siming, disciple of Elder Liu. This is my son Tang Xiao."

Recognition drained Wang Sibin's face. Tang's entertainment conglomerate partially owned his company. "Y-Young Master Guan? The... the one who shook Beijing's foundations?"

Qin Tian and Zheng Chaoyang exchanged panicked looks. Their "penniless student" target was the infamous architect of recent political purges?

Tang Siming glared at the trembling CEO. "Apologize to Young Master Guan immediately!"

Wang Sibin stuttered helplessly. Zheng Chaoyang hissed at Qin Tian: "You said he was nobody!"

Qin Tian turned to Wen Ya, who coldly replied: "No one dares cross him in N City."

As reality sank in, the trio's bluster evaporated. Guan Yu observed their crumbling defiance, savoring the sweet taste of impending victory.
