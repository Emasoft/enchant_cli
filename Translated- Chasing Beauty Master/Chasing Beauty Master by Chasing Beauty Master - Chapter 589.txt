An ordinary person would never dare attempt such a feat. Channeling spiritual energy through all six meridians simultaneously demanded tremendous mental focus—the slightest misstep could result in qi deviation and catastrophic bodily rupture! Guan Yu (Cosmic Space) knew these dangers intimately, yet he pressed forward not from recklessness, but through hard-won confidence. Days spent directing torrents of energy through his meridians had honed his control over the surging currents flowing into his dantian’s Qi Sea.

When the swirling vortex of energy above his palms reached critical mass, Guan Yu roared, “Condense!” and unleashed the tempest into his meridians. A thunderous boom echoed through his body as the raging tide flooded all six channels. Agony lanced through his veins like molten steel, blurring his vision. Teeth gritted, he channeled the deluge downward—

The Qi Sea within his dantian whirled like a celestial maelstrom, devouring the incoming energy. As the reservoir neared fullness, Guan Yu throttled the flow to a trickle. At the final droplet’s descent, he bellowed again: “Condense!”

The vortex reversed. What once filled his entire dantian contracted into a dense, spiraling orb suspended at its core. Without pause, Guan Yu launched into his Power Fist drills. With all six meridians now unblocked, he yearned to test this enhanced union of Power Fist and Tortoise Breathing Technique.

After acclimating to dual-channel energy flow through both arms, Guan Yu faced a boulder twice yesterday’s size. His fist struck like a meteor—the monolith exploded into powdered debris. “Not bad,” he murmured, observing the settling dust. “Even a Qi Refining cultivator would struggle to withstand this.”

Yet triumph proved fleeting. Upon shattering a two-meter thick tree trunk, searing pain erupted through his arms. Blood webbed across cracking skin as he collapsed.

**Chapter 1492: Further Tempering**

Guan Yu stared in horror—his arms resembled shattered porcelain, crimson seeping from hairline fractures spanning shoulders to fingertips. “Hiss— Damn it! Why now?” he gasped. Even his stoneheart-enhanced limbs had reached their limit.

Stumbling downhill, each movement worsened the hemorrhaging. Darkness swallowed his vision midway.

The stone heart embedded in his chest flared. Golden light cocooned his arms, stitching flesh—only for new cracks to spiderweb through freshly healed tissue. Agony yanked him between consciousness and void as the artifact worked, reforging bone and sinew through cycles of destruction and rebirth.

**Chapter 1493: Tortoise Breathing Technique**

Dawn revealed Guan Yu bloodied but whole amidst shattered rocks. Flexing revitalized arms, he laughed hoarsely. “Worth every scream.” No longer would he cower before arrogant young masters—not with strength rivaling Second Layer Qi Refiners.

A commotion interrupted his descent. Pushing through foliage, he found twin sisters—neighbors he’d watched since childhood—cornered by Zhang Tian.

“Thief!” The elder sister clutched a crimson herb glowing with yang essence. “We found this Scarlet Sun Grass!”

Zhang Tian sneered. “My herb. Hand it over, or your delicate sister learns pain.”

As the trembling girl tossed the prize, Guan Yu moved.

**Chapter 1494: Serpent’s Den**

Snatching the herb midair, Guan Yu’s reforged fist met Zhang Tian’s nose with a crunch. “Remember me?”

Chaos erupted. Later, at the Huntian Sect’s tournament grounds, spectators murmured as Guan Yu (Feather) lounged with Huo Lingling, ignoring the crowds.

“Brother Guan Yu!” She gaped at his aura. “You’ve broken through again?!”

Indeed—two realms in five days. While others toiled lifetimes for single advancements, Guan Yu ascended like a comet. Distant cheers announced VIP arrivals, but he waved them off. “Celebrity hounds. Let’s—”

A leather bag thumped onto the judges’ platform. Eleven venomous snakes spilled out—each head crushed by bare hands. Guan Yu (Cosmic Space) met the disbelieving stares. “Count them.”

As challengers protested, he devoured a fanged head whole. “Tastes fine.” The crowd erupted. From bloodied outcast to legend—Guan Yu’s rebirth had begun.
