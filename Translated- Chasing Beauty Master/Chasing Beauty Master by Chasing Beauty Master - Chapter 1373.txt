“The Left Envoy never intended to let these people leave alive. Upon hearing that Guan Yu had obtained the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, he coldly declared without hesitation, ‘Excellent! Since the Eight-Sided Drum resides with Guan Yu, do not blame us for what comes next!’

With a wave of his hand, disciples of the Demon Soul Sect swiftly surrounded Guan Yu and his companions. ‘Guan Yu,’ the Left Envoy continued, ‘I truly have no wish to kill you. Hand over the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, and I may consider letting you all leave alive.’

Wang Xiaorong whirled around, pointing at the Azure Dragon Left Envoy. ‘Brother Left Envoy! How dare you turn on us so abruptly? I forbid you to harm Guan Yu—do you understand?’

‘Princess, I beg you—do not interfere!’ pleaded the Left Envoy. ‘The Eight-Sided Drum Technique is the objective of our mission. Now that Guan Yu possesses it, if we do not eliminate him, we cannot return to face the Demon Lord!’

‘I care not for your excuses! You will not lay a finger on Guan Yu!’ Wang Xiaorong retorted, planting herself defiantly before the Left Envoy with hands on her hips.

‘Princess, I implore you… step aside,’ the Left Envoy entreated, desperation etched on his face.

Pouting stubbornly, Wang Xiaorong refused to yield. She knew anyone seeking to harm Guan Yu would have to go through her first.

Finally, the Left Envoy snapped, ‘Princess, if you persist in obstructing me, do not blame me for acting harshly! I know offending you will bring dire consequences, but I shall personally atone to the Demon Lord upon our return. Fox Spirit—escort the Princess away!’

‘How dare you!’ Wang Xiaorong glared at the white fox demon, who recoiled under her gaze. ‘Let me make this clear: anyone who dares attack Guan Yu today will face my wrath!’

Guan Yu and his companions were taken aback by Wang Xiaorong’s fierce protection. Though unafraid of the Demon Soul Sect’s disciples, her loyalty deepened his trust in her character.

Stepping forward, Guan Yu gently tugged Wang Xiaorong’s sleeve. ‘There’s no need for such anger. The Demon Soul Sect’s forces here are beneath my concern. If they wish to fight, let them come. I could use the exercise—and test whether the Eight-Sided Drum Technique lives up to its legend.’

‘Do not worry, Guan Yu,’ Wang Xiaorong declared confidently. ‘With me here, they dare not move against you.’

The Azure Dragon Left Envoy grimaced in frustration. Though they knew Guan Yu held the technique, they were powerless to act. Defeated, he growled, ‘We withdraw. Princess, you must return with us.’

To everyone’s surprise, Wang Xiaorong nodded. ‘Very well. Let us depart now.’ Casting a reluctant glance at Guan Yu, she followed the Demon Soul Sect’s retinue.

To prevent conflict, Wang Xiaorong had no choice but to leave with them. Had she stayed, the Left Envoy would never have retreated peacefully, risking irreparable consequences.

Later, Guan Yu’s group emerged from an ancient well in the center of Yingzhen—the hidden entrance to Duobao Mountain, long undiscovered. By the time they climbed out, dusk had fallen the following day. They soon returned to the Qin Manor.

In Qin Tāijīn’s chambers, Xiao Zhi addressed his aunt: ‘When Uncle returns, he must appoint a new steward. Steward Sun… will not be returning.’

‘Oh? Why is that?’ asked the aunt, perplexed.

Xiao Zhi hesitated, unwilling to mention demonic sects and frighten the household. Guan Yu interjected, ‘Madam Qin, Steward Sun harbored ulterior motives—likely coveting a Qin family treasure. We exposed him, and he fled.’

‘Good heavens! To think we never noticed! Thank you for resolving this,’ Madam Qin exclaimed gratefully.

Though still bedridden with injuries, Qin Tāijīn croaked, ‘You lot—go investigate who assaulted me! I’ll have them torn limb from limb!’

His commanding tone drew silent disdain. Xiao Zhi coolly replied, ‘Aunt, we came to bid farewell. We depart tomorrow for Yunqing Sect.’

‘So soon? Have you completed your business?’ Madam Qin asked wistfully.

‘Yes. We must report to our sect,’ Guan Yu said. ‘Thank you for your hospitality.’

‘You’re all fine youths, and Xiao Zhi is family. Visit often!’ Madam Qin urged.

‘Stay!’ Qin Tāijīn demanded. ‘You cultivators must capture my attacker first!’

‘Enough!’ Madam Qin chided. ‘They have duties elsewhere.’

In the Yunqing Sect, Xiao Zhi showed a blood-stained cloth to Elder Zheng. ‘These are demonic runes. How did you obtain this?’

Recognition flashed across Guan Yu’s face—the symbols matched those on a golden dagger and a demonic tome he’d encountered. ‘Elder Zheng, do you read demonic script?’

‘I cannot, but I recognize it,’ Elder Zheng admitted. ‘Return to the sect at once. The掌门 will decide our course.’

Guan Yu agreed. With three powerful artifacts in his possession—and Wang Xiaorong likely to gossip—he needed the sect’s protection without Second Wolf’s guardianship.

***

At the Demon Soul Sect’s stronghold, the Demon Lord thundered, ‘Why wasn’t Guan Yu captured? If Yunqing obtains the Eight-Sided Drum, all is lost!’

The Left Envoy shot Wang Xiaorong a meaningful glance. ‘Princess stopped me. With our forces depleted and allies against us, confrontation was unwise.’

‘Father,’ Wang Xiaorong interjected, ‘the temple door bore the Blackblood Ridge’s sigil. Only the Sky Incinerator could open it—which Guan Yu possessed despite Yunqing’s confiscation claims.’

‘Impossible! Yunqing couldn’t have known!’ the Demon Lord roared. ‘What of the Eight-Sided Drum?’

‘A blood orb fused with Guan Yu when he touched it. Grandmaster Menghua’s remnant spirit revealed it contained the technique.’

‘Why didn’t you kill him then?!’ the Demon Lord demanded, instantly regretting the futile question.

‘The technique has four parts,’ Wang Xiaorong added. ‘A cloth fragment hinted the next lies beneath Golden City’s Divine Stone Mountain, blooming when fragrant winds rise.’

‘Where is this cloth?!’

‘Guan Yu has it… but he cannot read demonic script!’ she insisted.

‘Foolish girl!’ the Demon Lord lamented. ‘Must you always side with my enemy? If he deciphers it first, our doom is sealed!’

Wang Xiaorong lowered her head, silently defiant. The Demon Lord sighed—his daughter’s heart remained unyieldingly split between loyalty and love.
