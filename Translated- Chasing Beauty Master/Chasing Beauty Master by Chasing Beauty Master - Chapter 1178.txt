Guan Yu shook his head at Lin Qiaoqiao before looking up at Li Gui with icy contempt. “You’re unworthy to speak to me, let alone search my person. That watch might mean everything to you, but to me, it’s trash not worth stealing—I wouldn’t take it if you paid me.”

“Brave words from a windbag!” Li Gui jabbed a finger at him. “If you’ve got nothing to hide, let me search you! Your refusal proves you’re guilty—a hypocrite and a coward!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Ah, the rabid lapdog barks. Did your mother never teach you manners? What a vulgar creature.”

The crowd stirred. Guan Yu’s retort had insulted not just Li Gui but his parents. Li Gui’s father, standing nearby, flushed with anger. If he remained silent now, he’d be branded a coward.

The older Li man strode forward to stand beside his son, glowering. Before he could speak, Guan Yu raised his voice: “Ah, sir! The family resemblance is striking. Looking at you two, I’m reminded of a fitting title—the Father-Son Trash Duo.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The elder Li, not yet having uttered a word, now trembled with rage. “You impudent brat!” he spat. “That watch was in your plastic bag—intact and never out of your grasp! Its disappearance demands explanation!”

“Explanation?” Guan Yu scoffed. “I don’t care what schemes you father-son snakes concoct. I didn’t steal your trinket. Believe it or not—I won’t waste breath convincing vermin.”

Turning to Lin Qiaoqiao, he added softly, “No need to argue with these lowlifes. They’re beneath explanation.”

Lin Qiaoqiao bit her lip. This gathering should have been joyous, yet a cheap watch had poisoned the air. “Brother Li Gui,” she pleaded, “Guan Yu would never steal. Please don’t wrong him.”

“Wrong him?” Li Gui sneered. “You’re blinded by his pretty face! That silver-tongued snake—”

“Quite right!” Guan Yu interrupted mockingly. “Miss Lin should indeed beware my devastating charm. Otherwise, this Li fellow might challenge me to pistols at dawn.”

Exasperated, Lin Qiaoqiao turned to Li Gui. “I’ll buy you an identical watch tomorrow. Can’t we end this?”

Li Gui hesitated, but his father stepped forward. “Our family’s honor is at stake! We won’t be cheated by some thief!” The older man’s eyes narrowed. “Submit to a search, boy, or admit your guilt!”

Guan Yu’s smile vanished. “You lack the standing to demand anything of me. Take your baseless accusations elsewhere.”

As tensions escalated, Lin Zhonggeng—Lin Qiaoqiao’s father—intervened. “Brother Li, Guan Yu is our honored guest. I vouch for his character. Let this matter rest.”

But Guan Yu raised his hand. “These vipers won’t relent. They’ve targeted me since arrival. The world should see their true colors.” He locked eyes with the Lis. “Want to search me? Come try.”

An Arctic chill seemed to emanate from Guan Yu. Though devoid of cultivation aura now, his commanding presence froze Li Gui in place—legs trembling, courage faltering.

Lin Zhonggeng hurried forward. “Brother Li, must we mar my daughter’s celebration with this farce?”

“Farce?” The elder Li bristled. “This whelp insults our family! We demand satisfaction!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Two thousand yuan? My wristwatches cost twenty times that. But mangy dogs will bark at what they can’t comprehend.”

Snickers spread through the crowd until Lin Zhonggeng raised his voice. “Guan Yu resides in Qiao Garden Villa—a property worth billions! Would such a man steal pocket change?”

Shocked murmurs erupted. Li Gui paled. Billions? The sum dwarfed his wildest dreams.

“Lies!” The elder Li spat. “No billionaire would visit this backwater!”

Lin Zhonggeng’s gaze hardened. “Would I, at my age, spin fairy tales? The Qiao Garden deed is public record!”

As doubt crept into the crowd’s eyes, Guan Yu stepped forward. “Spare your breath, Uncle Lin. These leeches thrive on envy.” He smirked at the Lis. “Well? Still eager to search me?”

Li Gui’s fists clenched. “Rich or not, you’ll apologize for your insults!”

“Apologize?” Guan Yu’s laugh was glacial. “Come make me.”

Lin Qiaoqiao gripped his arm. “Please, don’t escalate!”

He patted her hand gently before addressing the crowd. “Mark my words—these Lis are serpents. Let their venom reveal itself tonight.”

The elder Li surged forward, face purple with rage. “You arrogant—”

“Enough!” Lin Zhonggeng roared. “This ends now! Brother Li, if you value our friendship, withdraw!”

As the standoff teetered on violence, Guan Yu stood relaxed, a panther toying with mice. The truth hung palpable—a watch meant nothing, but pride everything. And in this game of faces, only one truth remained:

Money talked, but power silenced.
