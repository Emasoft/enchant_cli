After arriving at the detention center nestled at the foot of the mountain in City N's suburbs, the vehicle halted before towering electrified walls and an imposing iron gate. Within moments, the gates creaked open, allowing Jiang Xun to drive inside.

"New arrivals? What's their case?" A guard at the post glanced casually at Guan Yu and Niu Le.

Jiang Xun smiled, instructing the duo to wait while he completed registration formalities. Soon, he led them into the main building.

In the intake room, several officers sat documenting items while newly arrived suspects stood nearby. "Wait here," Jiang Xun said. Even with Director Nie's prior arrangements, protocol demanded newcomers remain standing.

"Remove your belts. Anything else hidden?" A swarthy officer in his thirties barked at an elderly suspect.

"Nothing... nothing at all!" The fifty-something man hastily assured.

"If we find anything during inspection, you'll regret it! Empty your pockets and stand over there!"

One by one, suspects underwent searches, item logging, and fingerprinting. Soon, it was Niu Le and Guan Yu's turn. After surrendering belts, shoelaces, phones, and wallets, they joined the others.

"These two are Director Nie's people," Jiang Xun murmured to the dark-skinned officer, offering a cigarette.

The officer smirked coldly. "That means nothing here. Arrangements happen inside."

Jiang Xun nodded knowingly before turning to leave. "That's it for now. We're off. Guan Yu—"

Guan Yu waved dismissively. "See you around. Thanks, Captain Jiang."

Through the inspection area's rear door, Guan Yu and others were lined against a wall for thorough pat-downs. "Fuck your mother! Didn't we say no smuggling?" The officer roared, slapping an old man who hid money under his shoe insert. "What'll you buy in here—your fucking grave?"

"It... it's old money I forgot about," the man stammered.

After confiscating the cash and kicking the offender aside, officers marched the group through dim, mildew-scented corridors to their cells—a holding area for serious felony suspects awaiting trial.

Assigned to Cell 4, Guan Yu faced twenty-odd inmates. A burly bald man named Da Long (Big Dragon), the cell boss, looked up from his magazine. "What's your crime?"

"Hero saving a beauty. Accidentally killed someone," Guan Yu replied.

Da Long sneered. "A hero? With that face?" His mockery was cut short by Xiao Xiong (Heroic Bear), a young inmate across from him: "Enough. The warden said go easy."

"Who's in charge here?" Da Long slammed his magazine. "Want another beating?"

Xiao Xiong retorted by swinging his shackled feet, narrowly missing Da Long's face. As tension mounted, Guan Yu interjected: "Enough squabbling. I'll take your bunk, Big Dragon."

Chaos erupted. Inmates lunged but fell like dominos under Guan Yu's precise strikes. Within moments, three attackers lay groaning—one pinned against bent bed frames, another nose bleeding, a third cowering after a warning glare.

When Da Lung charged, Guan Yu's uppercut sent the 180-pound man flying. A follow-up kick split a steel bed frame into a V-shape. Silence fell.

"Any objections?" Guan Yu surveyed the room. Heads shook vigorously.

"Fix that bed," he ordered Da Long, now docile. The former boss struggled until Guan Yu effortlessly straightened the metal with knee and palm strikes.

Reassigning bunks, Guan Yu claimed Da Long's spot. Xiao Xiong watched warily, anticipating rebellion, but Da Long only fawned: "You're the boss now, Brother Yu!"

As night fell, Guan Yu lounged reading magazines, the cell's new hierarchy cemented through fists and shattered steel.
