“You still have the nerve to say that? It’s all because of you and Xue Jing!” Wang Jun complained. “What kind of existence was I before? To put it plainly—back when I was at Kaihuang Academy, anyone I fancied, whether male or female, I’d successfully chase them down, play around until I got bored, then dump them. That was the most glorious period of my life. I thought I was utterly flawless, without a single weakness. But after meeting you and Xue Jing, I realized many things weren’t as I imagined. I became deeply dissatisfied with myself, which led to… this decision in the end.”

“But you shouldn’t have ruined yourself like this!” Guan Yu looked at Wang Jun. Though her beauty had faded slightly, weathered by time, she could still be called a striking woman. It pained him to see such a fine woman transform herself into a man.

“Maybe Xue Jing and I dealt you a heavy blow, but even so, you shouldn’t have lost hope like this?”

Guan Yu added, “Regretting it now, aren’t you? Too late, isn’t it? Your stubbornness is truly something. There’s no cure for regret in this world.”

“Whether I regret it or not, I’ve grown accustomed to this life. In fact, I’ve come to appreciate it here,” Wang Jun replied, her earlier gloom fading. “When I first arrived, I thought I’d traveled through time. Later, I realized this place truly exists—like something out of a historical drama. At first, I hated it: no appliances, no functioning phones, no computers for games. I thought I’d die of boredom. But once I began cultivating, life became… less tedious. Slowly, I adapted. Now I want to settle here.”

“Finding peace with your choices is always for the best,” Guan Yu nodded. “You’re right—this might be the start of a new chapter for you.”

Though Wang Jun likely still resented this rustic existence compared to the comforts of a modern city, she had no choice. Her altered appearance barred her from returning to society without ridicule. Here, she could live quietly, passing days in cultivation—her only viable path.

“Guan Yu, don’t you think fate binds us tightly? To meet again here…” Wang Jun suddenly mused.

Guan Yu stiffened, eyeing her warily. “Wang Jun, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask.”

“Ask away. Others I might refuse, but not you. I trust your character.”

“After… the surgery,” Guan Yu hesitated, “where do your preferences lie now? Men or women?” If Wang Jun leaned toward men now, Guan Yu resolved to keep his distance—avoiding the sticky situations of their academy days.

Wang Jun sighed. “You enjoy mocking me, don’t you? I told you—the procedure failed. To be clear: I have no orientation. I can’t engage in… such matters. So I don’t dwell on them.”

“I see. My apologies for prying. But I believe time will heal this.”

“It’s incurable,” Wang Jun said bleakly. “I consulted the West’s top specialists. They called it a chronic cancer—untreatable, only manageable. Any day, it could worsen… and that’ll be the end.”

Her gaze drifted out the window. “Now I just want to live joyfully each remaining day. They say cultivation prolongs life. Perhaps it’ll help my condition.”

“It will!” Guan Yu insisted. “Cultivation cures all ailments. Focus here, and one day you might recover. Optimism matters most—it surpasses any medicine.”

He knew without this illness, Wang Jun would never endure this ascetic life. She’d be reveling in the city’s pleasures. Only desperation drove her here—clinging to rumors of cultivation’s healing powers.

“Fate toys with us all. I’ve made peace with mine.” Wang Jun regarded Guan Yu enviously. “You’ve always been blessed—famous wherever you go. Even here, within days, every soul on Cloud Azure Mountain knows Guan Yu. Such prestige!”

“Just luck. Fortune favors none forever.” Guan Yu chuckled. “We each walk our path. Health is paramount—but since illness found you, don’t despair. Joy remains the best balm.”

“How did you come here anyway?” Wang Jun asked suddenly. “Not for me, surely?” She laughed, genuinely curious. Cloud Azure Mountain lay in remote wilderness, bordering western deserts—a place isolated from modern society. Outsiders rarely stumbled upon it, and those who knew kept its secrets, maintaining the fragile boundary between this mystical realm and the rational world.

“Actually, I was captured,” Guan Yu stated bluntly.

“Captured?!” Wang Jun gaped. “You expect me to believe that? The Sect Leader gifted you premium magical artifacts! The Ancestral Master beseeched Elder Jiu to store spells for you! If you were a prisoner, why such privileges?”

“Truth needs no garnish. I helped a friend with family matters in a nearby town. After resolving it, we planned to return to A City. Then her relative arrived, seeking aid—a man-eating beast haunted their village. You know me—I couldn’t resist.”

He recounted the tale: the beast revealed as the village chief’s son, the ambush, the slaughter, and the discovery of a sinister tree by the stream. “We tried chopping it down, but Cloud Azure Sect guards intervened. That tree’s under their protection. So here we are—captives turned disciples.”

Wang Jun frowned, struggling to connect these events. “Even if captured, how did you become the Sect’s rising star? Chosen by Peak Master Lu, then the Sect Leader himself?”

“Peak Master Lu recognized my value immediately,” Guan Yu explained. “As a cultivator of the Boundary Sovereign realm, I’m a strategic asset. They competed to recruit me—offering magical tools, pleading with Ancestral Masters. I chose Master Xuanming. Call it… fortunate timing.”

“Luck clings to you like a shadow!” Wang Jealousy tinged Wang Jun’s laugh. “But wait—you’re a cultivator. Why would immortals recruit a martial artist?”

Guan Yu smiled. “What if I’m both?”

Wang Jun’s eyes widened. “Dual cultivation?! Impossible!”

“That’s why they invested so heavily. Peak Master Lu reportedly wept after gifting his treasures. But for a dual-path prodigy? Worth every coin.”

Before Wang Jun could retort, Second Wolf’s roar interrupted: “Guan Yu! We’re leaving! Lollygagging again? We’ll start without you!”

“Coming!” Guan Yu shouted back. He considered inviting Wang Jun to their clandestine barbecue but decided against it—her health required dietary restrictions, and as a disciple of the strict Bamboo Peak, her presence risked exposure.

As Wang Jun departed, she paused. “You’ll make the tournament’s top four, yes?”

“Naturally. Planning to challenge me?”

“Hardly. I couldn’t beat you if I tried.” She smirked. “Just curious—are the Sect Leader’s top-four prizes any good?”

“No idea. Master says I’ve enough artifacts already—they outclass any tournament reward.”

Left alone, Guan Yu returned to his quarters, greeted by the stench of alcohol. Second Wolf, flushed but steady, grinned: “Celebratory drinks! Now let’s hunt supper!”

Ignoring curious stares, the group trekked to their forest clearing. Aze assembled their iron grill—upgraded from flammable wood—while burying excess wine jars to preserve them underground, as tradition dictated.

As Guan Yu protested fetching more game, Second Wolf retorted: “That boar won’t last! Fresh meat’s better!” The debate continued, their camaraderie echoing through Cloud Azure’s ancient woods—a band of misfits thriving in this liminal world where magic and mortality intertwined.
