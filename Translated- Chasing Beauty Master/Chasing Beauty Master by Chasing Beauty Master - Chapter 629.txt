Wei Fenggu was stunned. He had believed the attack he launched would reduce both of them to dust, yet they had escaped. Damnation! Next time, you won’t be so lucky! The crowd grew furious witnessing Wei Fenggu’s sudden assault. Murong Fengyu was about to charge into a three-hundred-round duel with him when Yiyuan abruptly intercepted. “I’ll fight you!” Murong had no choice but to engage Yiyuan, while Jue and Lingchi found themselves blocked by Hu Tianhe’s forces. The battle’s momentum once again tilted in Hu Tianhe’s favor.

Zhang Wuhen glared coldly at Wei Fenggu. How dare he attack his Wuer! The man had a death wish! Just as he prepared to strike, Hu Tianhe committed an act he would forever regret.

To everyone’s shock—including Kong Lianxu’s—Hu Tianhe launched an assault on Tian Huanyun. The woman stared in disbelief, a glistening teardrop falling from the corner of her eye as she closed them in despair. When Hu Tianhe saw that tear, regret surged through him—but it was too late. His gaze darkened. He wanted to speak, yet remained silent, shutting his eyes to avoid witnessing what came next.

Zhang Wuhen lunged and pulled Tian Huanyun aside. Were she not Wuer’s mother—the person he cherished most—he wouldn’t have bothered! Murong Fengyu gaped at Zhang rescuing a stranger. What madness was this? His distraction nearly cost him as Yiyuan’s strike grazed him.

“Stay focused!” Yiyuan roared, irritation flashing. This dual-element cultivator, newly ascended to Realm Sovereign, could hold his own against mid-level Sovereigns—a rare challenge!

Kong Lianxu and Guan Yu exhaled in relief as Zhang saved Tian Huanyun, sending him grateful glances. Now Kong had no choice but to guard Tian Huanyun constantly. When Zhang saw Guan Yu smile at him for the first time, he froze—until his gaze fell on Hu Tianhe. The Lord of Mount Mingwang, renowned yet ruthless, had tried to murder his own wife!

Hu Tianhe cautiously opened his eyes, relieved not to see the expected carnage. He dared not look at Tian Huanyun, fearing her shattered gaze.

**Chapter 1599: Light Elemental Ability**

When Hu Tianhe turned away, he met another icy stare. Since when did this emotionless man save unrelated strangers? Because of him? Hu Tianhe’s eyes shifted toward Guan Yu.

Guan Yu returned the frigid glare. Attacking his mother? Unforgivable! But his immediate foe was Wei Fenggu. Trusting Kong to protect her, he focused fully on Wei. Zhang and Hu Tianhe’s gazes clashed midair before their battle erupted.

Zhang’s displayed power shocked everyone. Another monstrous talent? Hu Tianhe inwardly cursed as he faced shifting elemental attacks—wind, wood, metal! How many elements did this fiend control? Only when Zhang cycled through all but light did Hu Tianhe realize: an eight-element cultivator! Yet he remained unaware of an even greater monster—his own nemesis.

The crowd stood dumbstruck while Xuanye’s group remained calm. Their master’s terror was old news. Suddenly, Guan Yu collapsed, writhing as if flayed by a thousand blades. Hu Xiaohai paled—the full moon! To outsiders, it seemed Wei’s strike had felled him, yet Wei himself looked baffled. His attack hadn’t connected! Hu Xiaohai cradled Guan Yu, shouting unheard pleas.

Chaos erupted. Murong and Kong, distracted, took hits—Murong from Yiyuan, Kong from Ye Lingyun’s chest strike. Zhang struggled desperately against mid-Heaven Sovereign Hu Tianhe, already at his limit.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu wandered a fog-shrouded realm, stars visible above. Familiar yet alien. Back on the battlefield, Hu Xiaohai endured Wei’s onslaught, blood trickling from his lips. Murong’s robes soaked through with blood and sweat as he held Yiyuan. Zhang, pale and scarred, clung to consciousness.

Wei Fenggu summoned wooden vines from the earth, encircling Guan Yu and Hu Xiaohai. Though Hu burned some with fading fire energy, the relentless greenery closed in.

“No!” Zhang roared, darting toward them—only to be blasted back by Hu Tianhe’s dark energy.

Kong and Murong lunged too late. Vines engulfed Guan Yu as Hu Xiaohai collapsed, sucked into the Soul-Devouring Whip.

Watching Guan Yu’s capture, Zhang felt his heart pierced—he’d unknowingly fallen for him.

Under the stars, a voice echoed in Guan Yu’s mind: *“Child, stars and creation are your allies. Light and darkness coexist within you. The fate of all lives rests in your hands. Go—the world needs you!”*

Pushed back to reality, Guan Yu glimpsed his comrades’ dire states through pain-hazed eyes. Wei Fenggu prepared a killing blow.

“No!” A figure intercepted—Murong Ling! As the vines fully enveloped Guan Yu, agony tore through him. The voice returned: *“Summon the darkness!”*

“Summon... darkness...” Guan Yu murmured, consciousness fading.

**Chapter 1600: Spirit Pearls Reappear**

Wei Fenggu smirked at his trapped prey. Finally dead! Yet Zhang’s group stared in disbelief—this couldn’t be!

Suddenly, the vines parted like subjects bowing to their king. Guan Yu hovered midair, shrouded in darkness that reeked of death. Even Yiyuan and Wei Fenggu shuddered.

“Mordoka!” Guan Yu screamed, engulfed by primal power. When the darkness lifted, his attire had transformed—black minidress, obsidian boots, one sleeve baring pale skin, violet hair whipping like stormclouds.

A colossal energy surge approached from the palace. Nine glowing orbs streaked through the sky—Spirit Pearls! The crowd erupted.

“Heavens! The legendary Spirit Pearls!”

“So they were here all along!”

Hu Tianhe lunged for them, only to be repelled, bloodied. The pearls ignored all, swirling around Guan Yu in a vortex with the Holy Pearl above. As they merged into his body, markings appeared—obsidian pendant, white necklace, prismatic bracelet. The Soul-Devouring Whip coiled at his waist like chains.

Black wings unfurled from his back, hair shifting to violet, eyes burning crimson. An avatar of death. Yiyuan panicked, hurling lightning—only for Guan Yu to dodge effortlessly with a wingbeat.

Wherever his hollow gaze fell, life withered. Those below Saint Sovereign rank died screaming; higher cultivators barely resisted. Terror replaced confusion—what unholy power was this?

**Chapter 1601: The Strong Forge Their Path**

Guan Yu answered with action. Dark elements converged at his raised hands faster than any Sovereign could muster, shrouding the arena. Hu Tianhe gaped—he’d possessed these pearls for years, yet never unlocked such power!

Zhang felt strange kinship with the darkness. Guan Yu bombarded Yiyuan and Wei with attacks, reducing the Sovereigns to pitiful states. Spectators marveled—a Saint Sovereign overwhelming two Realm Sovereigns!

As dark energy suffocated the weak, Hu Tianhe bitterly regretted his choices. Had he not stolen the pearls, this monster might have been his ally.

Guan Yu’s empty eyes fixed on the Sovereigns. The surrounding vegetation decayed instantly under his gaze. Survivors realized—this was no mere cultivator. This was annihilation incarnate.
