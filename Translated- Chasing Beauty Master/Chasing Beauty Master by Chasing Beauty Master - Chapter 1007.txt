“Seeing that he couldn’t reason with Big Beard, Feitianlang (Flying Sky Wolf) simply ignored him. Though tempted to kill the bearded man outright, he feared provoking the other three monks into further defiance.

‘Fine. Since you’re all so uncooperative, I’ll take you as hostages. Let’s see if Guan Yu is as trustworthy as you claim,’ Feitianlang declared before striding out.

Guan Yu had considered rising to escape with the four monks, but with only himself and Xue Jing, moving all four—plus the portly Wei Hongwei—was impossible. Reluctantly, he decided to wait and observe Feitianlang’s next move.

Soon, Feitianlang returned to the hall, carrying a basin of water in his right hand and a coil of rope in his left. After binding the monks together, he splashed water onto the faces of Guan Yu and the others. Guan Yu felt Wei Hongwei stir beneath him.

‘Ugh… My head aches… What happened?’ Wei Hongwei mumbled, eyes still closed.

Realizing the paralyzing drug likely dissolved upon contact with water, Guan Yu feigned grogginess. ‘What’s going on? Did it rain?’ he asked, pretending to notice their drenched clothes.

Xue Jing mimicked awakening, while Wei Hongwei, spotting the bound monks, cried, ‘Masters! What happened to you?’ He lunged to free them, oblivious to Feitianlang’s presence.

Collapsing weakly, Guan Yu groaned, ‘I’ve no strength… What’s happened?’

Wei Hongwei shook his head, bewildered. ‘My head throbs… How long have I been asleep?’

Having consumed the most tainted water, he remained disoriented.

‘The water must’ve been poisoned. I’m not sure of the details,’ Guan Yu lied, rubbing his temples while scanning the room. Feitianlang appeared to be alone—consistent with his solitary reputation.

Deeming the moment ripe, Feitianlang pressed his wolf claws to Wei Hongwei’s throat. ‘You’re all paralyzed. Without my antidote, you’ll never recover. Obey me if you value your lives.’ His triumphant grin suggested confidence in securing the treasure map.

Wei Hongwei shuddered, the cold metal chilling his neck. ‘S-Sir! Let’s talk this through! Don’t act rashly!’ He glanced pleadingly at Guan Yu. ‘Boss! Do something! What’s happening?’

‘You’re Guan Yu,’ Feitianlang stated.

‘I am,’ Guan Yu acknowledged. ‘What grudge do you hold against us?’

Feitianlang barked a laugh. ‘No past grievances—until now. I’ve long awaited this chance to confront you.’ His rapid, slurred speech carried a regional accent.

‘So we’re enemies now,’ Guan Yu said flatly. ‘But why?’

Internally, Guan Yu seethed at the threat. Only his desire for information stayed his hand from signaling Xue Jing to strike. Xue Jing, feigning weakness convincingly, kept watch.

Kicking Wei Hongwei, Feitianlang brandished his claws at the monks. ‘Their lives hinge on you, Guan Yu. Hand over the treasure map, and they get the antidote. Refuse, and they die one by one.’

Guan Yu clenched his jaw, resisting the urge to attack.

‘Treasure map? Again?’ Guan Yu sighed theatrically. ‘I’ve none left! Why does everyone harass me?’

‘Don’t play dumb!’ Feitianlang kicked Shengsheng, sending the limp monk sprawling. ‘The first fragment was stolen by Yingshangu, the second bought by the Fengs. Yet rumors claim you hold the third!’

‘Rumors lie,’ Guan Yu countered. ‘Who fed you this tale? Let’s confront them together.’

‘Clever, but I’m no fool,’ Feitianlang sneered. ‘My patience wears thin. Produce the map, or I slit his throat!’ He pressed the claws closer.

‘Wait!’ Guan Yu shouted as Wei Hongwei wailed.

Feitianlang paused—the threat a bluff. Xue Jing remained poised to intervene.

‘See reason,’ Feitianlang urged. ‘Hand it over, and all walk free.’

‘Such a valuable item isn’t kept on my person,’ Guan Yu stalled. ‘Free my friends, and I’ll lead you to its hiding place.’

After consideration, Feitianlang agreed. ‘No tricks. Lead me there now.’

Resolving to plant a fake map, Guan Yu probed, ‘Who informed you? Their accuracy impresses me.’

‘Irrelevant! Move!’

‘But I’m powerless,’ Guan Yu protested. ‘How can I guide you?’

‘Where is it?’

‘A cave in the rear mountains. Secluded and safe.’

Nodding, Feitianlang moved to bind him.

‘Wait! I… I’m contagious!’ Guan Yu blurted.

Feitianlang recoiled. ‘What?’

‘A virulent disease. My assistant wears a mask—she’s already infected.’ Guan Yu gestured to Xue Jing, whose face covering now seemed suspiciously intact.

Feitianlang failed to notice the discrepancy. ‘Then how do we proceed?’

‘Give Xue Jing the antidote. She’ll support me as we go. With me still weakened, you’ve nothing to fear.’

After hesitation, Feitianlang tossed Xue Jing a pill from afar. She pretended to swallow it.

‘The rear mountains teem with beasts,’ Guan Yu warned. ‘You’ll protect us?’

‘Of course,’ Feitianlang vowed, keeping five paces back. ‘Just lead the way.’

As they departed, Guan Yu noted Feitianlang’s wariness contradicted his ruthless reputation. Perhaps remnants of past humanity lingered beneath the infamy. Survival hinged on exploiting every weakness—real or feigned.
