You Dun immediately perked up, saying eagerly, “Is it really that simple? You’re not messing with me, are you?”

“With your current state, what fun would I get from messing with you? What else of yours is worth my time to fool?” Guan Yu replied impatiently.

“Fine, no problem. I’ll definitely help you settle this matter. But when the time comes, you absolutely must not call the police to arrest me,” You Dun declared.

“Of course. The only virtue I possess is keeping my word—I never deceive people. As long as you help me resolve this properly, you’ll regain your freedom. But don’t even think about fleeing after I leave, because I’ll be watching you from the shadows,” Guan Yu added with a threatening tone.

“No problem. Such a small task is well within my capabilities. Once my master comes looking for me, I’ll clearly explain everything you’ve instructed,” You Dun affirmed.

Guan Yu nodded. For You Dun, this matter was simplicity itself. There should be no reason for him to flee—after all, only by cooperating could he avoid imprisonment.

Guan Yu drove straight back to Dak’s warehouse and said to Ganbili, “I’ll be returning to Huaxia on an afternoon flight. Withdraw all your people here—consider this matter concluded.”

Guan Yu nodded. For You Dun, this matter was simplicity itself. There should be no reason for him to flee—after all, only by cooperating could he avoid imprisonment.

Guan Yu drove straight back to Dak’s warehouse and said to Ganbili, “I’ll be returning to Huaxia on an afternoon flight. Withdraw all your people here—consider this matter concluded.”

Ganbili stared at Guan Yu peculiarly. “Why the sudden change of heart? Didn’t you say you weren’t returning?”

“If you want to stay here, suit yourself. But I don’t feel like getting scolded, so I’ve decided to go back,” Guan Yu retorted, rolling his eyes.

After settling affairs, Guan Yu finally returned to City A with Jinhua at dawn the next day. After dropping Jinhua off at her apartment, Guan Yu said, “Jinhua, I need to return to Qiaoyuan District now. The sisters went there earlier because of my situation and gave Xue Jing an earful.”

Jinhua nodded understandingly. “Yes, you should hurry back. After all, I’ve been the one accompanying you these days—no need to worry about me.”

Guan Yu smiled approvingly. Jinhua’s intelligence and empathy satisfied him deeply. Yet only after his departure would Jinhua’s true sorrow surface.

As a woman, what she desired most was a home—a home with a man. Though Jinhua now had the man of her dreams, she couldn’t enter his household. This unshakable feeling had lingered in her heart for ages.

At times, it felt unbearably unnatural. Guan Yu’s home lacked no women, yet she wasn’t among them. Jinhua yearned to live by Guan Yu’s side, to see him daily and know his every move—that was her vision of “home.”

Watching Guan Yu’s retreating figure, Jinhua rushed to the window after he entered the elevator. She stared until his car vanished beyond the apartment gates. Emptiness engulfed her—solitary life had grown intolerable.

Though Guan Yu provided this apartment, she mostly dwelled here alone. Jinhua sighed deeply, mustering courage. This life wasn’t permanent—she believed her day would come to reside in Qiaoyuan District.

Moreover, her current existence wasn’t what she desired. Avenging her family remained the priority. Only after achieving that could true happiness begin.

When Guan Yu returned to Qiaoyuan District, Xue Jing had already been notified. All the women stood waiting at the entrance.

“Was such a grand reception necessary? It’s not even a special occasion,” Guan Yu chuckled after exiting the car.

Xue Jing stepped forward first, anxiety lingering in her voice. “You’re finally back. I heard you weren’t returning for two more days—I worried all night without sleep.”

“Heh, I’ve returned safely. No need for concern. Let’s not stand here—head inside,” Guan Yu replied warmly. He understood Xue Jing’s current mood perfectly.

Usually, Xue Jing attended to Guan Yu like a meticulous caretaker, granting him ample freedom. Yet this time, his absence had caused major trouble—even provoking the sisters’ anger.

Xue Jing didn’t complain, only blamed herself for negligence. After being scolded, she vowed to abandon her gaming obsession—Guan Yu’s safety mattered most.

Inside, Xue Jing remarked calmly, “Guan Yu, I heard you accomplished something remarkable overseas—it’s even made the news.”

“Yes! I saw those homeless children on TV—it broke my heart,” Lü Mei interjected.

Though Guan Yu had returned, weariness clung to him. His deepest concern remained Uncle Qing’s situation. Tomorrow marked the final day—would You Dun succeed in contacting his master?

Guan Yu chuckled at Lü Mei’s words. “Precisely because of that incident, I offended the syndicate. Whether they’re truly powerful or just bluffing, the sisters insisted I return—rendering this trip utterly futile.”

“If the sisters say there’s danger, there must be. They’d never deceive you,” Xue Jing said, massaging Guan Yu’s shoulders as she sat beside him. “From now on, I’ll accompany you wherever you go. Otherwise, you’re grounded.”

“What? You’ll follow me?” Guan Yu exclaimed, alarmed. This spelled trouble—undoubtedly the sisters’ demand to monitor his actions and ensure safety.

But this meant Xue Jing would become his shadow, complicating every move. Visiting Jinhua for private moments would prove impossible—and exposing Jinhua’s identity risked Yang family assassins targeting her.

“Big Brother, listen!” Zhang Han leaped into Guan Yu’s lap, munching crisps. “A fierce woman came earlier, scolded Sister Jing, and ordered her to follow you everywhere. Refuse, and you’re forbidden from leaving!”

Guan Yu winced. Describing Xu Jinglei as “fierce” would surely amuse her. “Well… having a companion seems unnecessary. I’ll be extra cautious—promise no more incidents,” he awkwardly proposed.

“Well… having a companion seems unnecessary. I’ll be extra cautious—promise no more incidents,” Guan Yu awkwardly proposed.

Amei brought a fruit platter. Zhang Han shoved a strawberry into Guan Yu’s mouth. “You should let Sister Jing accompany you,” Amei urged worriedly. “Otherwise, we’ll all panic if something recurs. Last night, Sister Jing and I stayed awake awaiting your return.”

“You’ve suffered needlessly. But I’m safely back now. As for Xue Jing’s supervision… we’ll discuss later. You should rest—you’ve been up all night.” Guan Yu deflected, unwilling to debate further.

The decision ultimately rested with the sisters. If Xue Jing insisted, refusal meant confronting Xu Jinglei—a losing battle. Reluctantly, Guan Yu surrendered. “Fine. If this is everyone’s wish, Xue Jing may accompany me henceforth. Mutual support isn’t bad.”

He quickly added, “I’m exhausted—need rest. Neck aches from the long flight. Wake me for dinner.” Escaping further interrogation about “outside women” was paramount. Thankfully Yang Conghan’s absence spared him her sharp deductions.

News of Guan Yu’s return soon reached Second Only to Wolf, who was instructing Acai on blade techniques in the courtyard. To him, the warblade reigned supreme—versatile in slashing, thrusting, and parrying.

Upon hearing the update, Second Only to Wolf mused, “Returned so swiftly? Has he resolved matters? Found his target?”

Deeming this favorable news, he hurried to inform Sakurako. Bursting into the kitchen where she prepared dinner, he boomed, “Sakura! He’s back! Finally back!”

Startled, Sakurako nearly cut herself. “Brother! Must you always barge in shouting? What’s back?”

“Guan Yu’s returned to Huaxia! He’ll come for you soon—aren’t you thrilled?”

“Ahhh!!!” Sakurako shrieked, overturning fish and chopping board. Second Only to Wolf covered his ears until the sonic assault ceased.

“Ahhh!!!” Sakurako shrieked, overturning fish and chopping board. Second Only to Wolf covered his ears until the sonic assault ceased.

Apologizing for the ruined dinner, Sakurako brightened when her brother suggested dining out. “Splendid! Let’s feast to celebrate!”

As Second Only to Wolf fetched Acai, Sakurako agonized before the mirror—what attire would Guan Yu prefer? Mature? Cute? Hairstyle? Her deliberations lasted half an hour until interrupted.

“Sakura, decided where to eat?” her brother asked.

“Huh? Is Guan Yu here? Has he arrived?” she exclaimed, jolting from reverie.
