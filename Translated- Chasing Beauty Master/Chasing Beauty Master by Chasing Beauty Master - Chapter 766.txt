“But the principal’s wife, in the hospital, fiercely berated Zhang Taiping, who pleaded pitifully, ‘Madam, let me explain! These are all lies spread by others to stir trouble. I’ve been wronged!’

‘Wronged?’ The principal’s wife erupted, her voice sharp with fury. ‘Why hasn’t anyone wronged *me*? Photos of you in bed with female students are plastered all over City A! You kidnapped a female teacher—it’s front-page news! And you still claim innocence?’ Her rage boiled over, and she began kicking and punching Zhang Taiping, heedless of his injuries.

Police officers nearby restrained her from further violence as they gathered information. Yet, the principal’s wife, though incensed, quickly shifted to self-preservation. Regardless of Zhang’s crimes, he was now severely injured, and she couldn’t let his assailant escape consequences.

‘That little vixen dared seduce *my* man!’ Her venomous words targeted Pan Xiaoxia, whom she denounced as the ‘other woman,’ while accusing Guan Yu of intentional assault. She swiftly filed a police report.

Upon learning Guan Yu allegedly possessed a firearm, the police dispatched four armored vehicles. By noon, sirens wailed as the convoy sped toward Kaihuang High School. Officers in bulletproof vests, armed with pistols, stormed the classrooms, heading straight for Guan Yu’s location.

Students on the sports field gaped in shock. ‘What’s happening?’

‘Probably here to arrest Guan Yu. He beat the security team to a pulp this morning—all critically injured. They must’ve called the police.’

‘Seems likely.’

Unbeknownst to them, Hou Jinshun’s gun threat against a waitress and Guan Yu’s intimidation of Zhang Taiping were grave crimes.

Meanwhile, Liu Shuowei, trembling upstairs, feared his own misdeeds—seducing female students—had been exposed. Convinced the police were after him, he hastily packed his office belongings and fled. Panicking, he ducked into a restroom... only to realize too late he’d entered the women’s room. Trapped, he dared not exit, lest he collide with approaching officers.

As footsteps echoed closer, Liu’s heart hammered. Fortunately, classes were in session, leaving the restroom empty—until he opened a stall door and found a female student seated inside, phone in hand.

‘Ah!’ she screamed. Liu clapped a hand over her mouth. ‘Don’t shout! I’m just hiding. I won’t hurt you.’

The girl, recognizing the notorious teacher, nodded shakily. Liu released her, and she gasped for air.

Cramped in the stall, tension thickened. Liu’s gaze roved over her—youthful, porcelain skin, glossy black hair framing delicate features. Her skirt remained undone, trousers pooled at her ankles. Lust coiled in him.

‘Screw it. My reputation’s ruined anyway. If I’m going to prison, I’ll have one last fling.’ Grinning lewdly, he rummaged his bag, producing a vial of white pills—potency stimulants smuggled from Dongniao. Swallowing two, he taunted, ‘Your boyfriend—is he any good in bed?’

The girl, petrified, nodded then shook her head. Liu chuckled, tracing her cheek. ‘Let’s compare, shall we?’

Forcing two pills down her throat, he bound her hands with a tie. She wept, ‘Teacher Liu, please let me go! I won’t tell—’

‘Let you go?’ He slapped her, leaving crimson welts. ‘Who’ll let *me* go?’ Stuffing paper into her mouth, he pounced as the drugs took effect.

——

In the classroom, police kicked open the door, startling the elderly teacher into collapsing. ‘Nobody move!’

Students froze. Never had officers stormed a class mid-lecture.

‘We’re here to arrest Guan Yu. Where is he?’ the lead officer demanded.

‘He’s absent today!’ The teacher rose, indignant. ‘This is a *school*. Barging in armed—have you no respect?’

Chastened, the officer apologized. ‘We received reports he’s armed. Extremely dangerous.’

After warnings to avoid Guan Yu, police retreated. Rumors exploded campus-wide:

‘Guan Yu’s done for—years in jail!’

‘He’s insane! Carrying a gun?’

News reached Xue Jing, who urgently contacted Hua Yu Group executives. ‘Guan Yu’s in deep trouble!’

——

Post-assault, Liu Shuowei gloated over the disheveled girl. ‘Who’s better, me or your boyfriend?’ Unbinding her, he brandished his phone. ‘Remember—leak this, and *everyone* sees these photos.’

She fled, skirt clutched, as Lü Mei frantically called Guan Yu: ‘The police are hunting you!’

‘Relax. I’m fine,’ Guan Yu lied, lounging at Pan Xiaoxia’s apartment.

Pan, guilt-ridden, embraced him. ‘I’ll confess everything to the police!’

‘Don’t. It’ll backfire.’ He nuzzled into her chest, savoring her warmth. ‘Trust me.’

——

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei updated Guan Yu: ‘The principal’s wife filed charges. But I’ll leak Liu’s incriminating videos to her.’

Guan Yu smirked. Let the scandal unfold.
