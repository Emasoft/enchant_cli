“I trust you, truly,” Zou Xiaoyu said calmly. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t have brought you to meet my uncle. In fact, I sensed something amiss when your friend came to borrow silver yesterday. But I didn’t dwell on it, for no one here would dare act so boldly. Yet he proved truly audacious.”

“Thank you for believing me,” Guan Yu replied.

He continued, “To be frank, my friend has grown accustomed to such recklessness. His arrogance has flourished unchecked for too long without consequence. It’s only natural he’d become inflated with self-importance. I understand this well.”

“He had no silver to repay, yet posed as a wealthy young master, borrowing two hundred taels in total—all lost gambling,” Zou Xiaoyu remarked as they walked.

Though fully aware of Lin Chen’s affairs, Guan Yu had chosen not to intervene until now. But with Ling Su’s growing hostility, Lin Chen’s role as a counterbalance had become indispensable. He could not be abandoned.

Zou Xiaoyu led Guan Yu to an unlatched gate and pushed through into a sizable courtyard behind the gambling den. Inside, a man in a white robe practiced slow, deliberate fist forms—mere physical exercise in Guan Yu’s eyes, devoid of martial substance.

“My uncle adores practicing boxing,” Zou Xiaoyu explained. “After learning a few moves from my father years ago, he’s maintained this daily ritual, rain or shine. He grows restless if he skips it.”

“Your uncle’s dedication is admirable,” Guan Yu observed with a smile.

Approaching the man, Zou Xiaoyu announced, “Uncle, I’ve brought someone—Guan Yu. He wishes to discuss a matter with you.”

“Oh? How unusual for you to visit!” The man chuckled, still moving through his forms. “Is this a suitor you’re introducing to your old uncle?” His jovial tone suggested the jest came easily, perhaps encouraged by the pair’s striking appearance—Guan Yu’s youthful handsomeness paired with Zou Xiaoyu’s beauty.

“Please don’t tease, Uncle! Mr. Guan has serious business,” Zou Xiaoyu protested, flustered.

Guan Yu assessed the man—appearing thirtyish, fitting the age gap between Zou Xiaoyu and her father, a captain in Prince Zou’s service.

“Very well,” the uncle relented, still flowing through his motions. “Out with it then. Dawn visits from my busy niece merit efficiency.”

Guan Yu found the continued practice during discussion discourteous, but Zou Xiaoyu interceded: “Mr. Guan’s friend owes two hundred taels from our establishment. We’ve come to negotiate terms.”

“Negotiate?” The uncle’s fists arced through the air. “Debts are repaid, not discussed. Where’s the complexity?”

Chapter 4380: The Arrogant Man

This civility was exceptional—borne of Guan Yu’s imposing presence. In Liaozhou City, few beyond the Prince’s household dared challenge Boss Zhou, whose ventures spanned gambling dens, inns, and more, all thriving under his cousin’s royal connections.

“Not all solutions are singular, Boss Zhou,” Guan Yu countered. “While I don’t dispute the debt, immediate repayment isn’t feasible. I propose alternative arrangements.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu *could* repay Lin Chen’s massive debt but saw no return on such investment. Negotiation was preferable, yet he’d abandon the gambler if necessary—Lin Chen’s utility against Ling Su didn’t warrant beggaring himself.

Boss Zhou halted his practice, eyeing Guan Yu disdainfully. “If one borrows, one repays. Are you here to settle his account?”

Guan Yu’s smile faded. Zou Xiaoyu interjected hastily: “Uncle, Mr. Guan is Prince Zou’s associate!”

“Ah, ‘associate’?” Boss Zhou’s tone softened marginally. Royal connections complicated matters—his entire empire rested on Prince Zou’s coattails.

“I presumed we might reach accord,” Guan Yu said coldly, turning to leave. “But clearly, my presence is wasted. Dispose of my friend as you will.”

“Wait!” Zou Xiaoyu entreated. Recognizing Guan Yu’s latent importance, she pressed: “Uncle, two hundred taels mean nothing to you! Why lose a valuable connection over trifles?”

Boss Zhou relented under his niece’s insistent gaze. “Stay, young sir. My words carried no ill intent.”

Chapter 4381: Eavesdropping

Seated in the parlor over tea poured by Zou Xiaoyu herself—a rare honor—Boss Zhou boasted: “My niece is Prince Zou’s adopted granddaughter! None dare cross her in Liaozhou.”

Guan Yu sipped bitter tea, then requested privacy. Though puzzled, Zou Xiaoyu withdrew... only to eavesdrop at the door.

“What of Prince Zou’s journey to the capital?” Guan Yu inquired.

“My cousin guards him there!” Boss Zhou enthused. “His Highness received imperial honors—rumor says he’ll be named Grand Prince!”

Guan Yu’s voice darkened. “That road ran red. Assassins dogged every mile—Imperial Guards under Second Prince’s orders. I escorted them.”

Boss Zhou paled. “You know Third Captain, my cousin?”

“Intimately.” Guan Yu’s gaze shifted to the door. “Miss Zou, you may join us.”

Chagrined, Zou Xiaoyu emerged. “How’d you detect me?”

“My methods suffice,” Guan Yu replied. “Hear then: ambushed in Darkwood Pass, surrounded by swordsmen and Imperial Guards... Many fell that night.”

Chapter 4382: Long Since Anticipated

The revelation hung heavily. Boss Zhou’s influence relied on his cousin’s royal favor; Zou Xiaoyu still awaited her father’s return.

Guan Yu hesitated—how much truth could they bear? The unspoken hovered: Third Captain’s fate might shatter their world.
