“Initially, Lin Chen had feared Guan Yu would abandon him entirely, leaving him stranded with neither coin nor clothing, dreading the harsh days ahead.

Not only did his wounds require spiritual energy to heal, but though one could endure days without sustenance, lacking silver for lodging would force him to sleep on the streets.

To his relief, Guan Yu had shown a shred of conscience, sending a junior brother with a small pouch of silver. At least he hadn’t been utterly forsaken. Truthfully, even if Guan Yu had left him here without aid, Lin Chen couldn’t have complained. Returning to the Yunqing Sect would only bring punishment for his grave errors.

‘Senior Brother Lin Chen, I’ll take my leave if there’s nothing else,’ the junior brother said, placing the pouch beside him.

Lin Chen nodded faintly. Though his injuries weren’t fatal, surviving here required silver for lodging. Once healed, he’d return to the sect.

With the silver, his worries eased. But as the junior brother reached the door, he paused. ‘Guan Yu asked me to relay this: you might consider staying at the same inn we used before.’

Baffled, Lin Chen pondered Guan Yu’s motive. Why suggest moving? Only when he opened the pouch did realization strike.

Guan Yu had indeed left silver—but a mere five taels. Enough for a single day’s stay at this inn, or two days at the shabby lodgings they’d previously endured.

‘That bastard Guan Yu! Miserly cur!’ Lin Chen cursed, clenching the pouch. How the mighty had fallen! Had he not been injured, he’d make Guan Yu pay.

Yet pragmatism prevailed. At least there was some silver. Better than none.

A pressing issue remained: Lin Chen’s injuries, though healing, left him hobbling. Moving to cheaper lodgings would be arduous.

‘Guan Yu, heartless fiend! Tormenting me even now!’ he spat.

Unaware of Lin Chen’s curses, Guan Yu’s group prepared to depart. Ling Su smirked, having secretly converted 100 taels of silver notes to coin, keeping it all. With Lin Chen gone, he’d finally court Siqi unimpeded.

‘Stay united in the desert,’ Guan Yu declared, leading the camel caravan onward.

By midday, barren landscapes replaced civilization. Wang Jun rode beside Guan Yu. ‘Aren’t you afraid Lin Chen will seek revenge? Or poison Xuanming’s ear against you?’

Guan Yu scoffed. ‘Let him try. I’d welcome it. As for Xuanming…’ His dismissive tone implied even the sect leader held no sway over him.

Aze, listening nearby, dared not question this near-treason.

At noon, Ling Su sidled up to Siqi. ‘You’ve been quiet. Lonely?’

‘Keep your distance,’ she warned coldly.

Guan Yu interposed himself. ‘Trouble, Ling Su?’

‘This is between Siqi and me!’

‘Siqi,’ Guan Yu declared, ‘is closer to me than a sister. You’re the toad lusting after swan’s flesh.’

Ling Su reddened. ‘You think you can claim her? I’ll win her heart!’

‘Claim her?’ Guan Yu laughed. ‘Need I? She’s already mine.’

As Ling Su spluttered, Siqi rose, linking arms with Guan Yu. ‘He speaks truth. Cease your pestering.’

The group stared. Their icy beauty, now openly affectionate! Ling Su’s face crumpled.

‘You… you’ll regret this!’ he stammered before retreating.

That evening at camp, Ling Su brooded alone. Others avoided him, recalling Guan Yu’s accusation: Ling Su had tried burning Lin Chen alive.

As tents rose, Siqi approached Guan Yu. ‘I fear sleeping alone…’

‘Share my tent,’ he offered. Let Ling Su seethe.

Wang Jun chuckled, witnessing their closeness. ‘Knew you two were destined. From that first summit meeting…’

Siqi arched a brow. ‘You foresee such things?’

‘Only for Guan Yu. His romantic fate shines brighter than Tiger Head Peak’s dawns.’

Night chilled the dunes, but residual warmth lingered. Without firewood, they huddled in clothes.

Wang Jun found Siqi by Guan Yu’s tent. ‘Need help pitching yours?’

‘No need. I’ll stay with Guan Yu.’

‘Wise. His embrace wards off desert chills.’ Wang Jun winked. ‘Knew you’d choose him. That ice-mask never fooled me.’

Siqi smiled—a rare sight that once set sect hearts aflame, now reserved for one man. The desert wind carried whispers of shifting allegiances, silvered treacheries, and love blooming amidst the sands.”
