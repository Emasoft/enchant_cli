“Cut the crap! If they want to eat, the woman can sit on my lap and take her time. The men can wait until I’m done!”

Guan Yu could tell the sushi restaurant owner was decent. Foreigners running businesses in China faced enough challenges, and the man had even helped argue for seating after hearing the server’s brief explanation earlier. Guan Yu respected him.

The fat man’s gaze lingered on Lü Mei as the owner shook his head helplessly. “Honored guests, I deeply apologize. Please dine elsewhere today. We’re fully occupied, but your next meal here will be complimentary.”

The owner handled the situation gracefully, offering two takeaway sushi boxes as apology. “These are our specialty rolls—a token of sincerity.”

Guan Yu accepted the offering without pretense. “Thanks. Let’s go.” The sushi mattered—Qian Yaoyao had been craving it, and at least they could eat it back at the hotel.

“Stop! Men leave. Women stay.”

The fat man’s roar halted them. Guan Yu had swallowed his pride to avoid trouble, but this crossed the line. When patience expired, he turned coldly. “Qualify to keep her? You?”

Wei Hongwei perked up at Guan Yu’s tone. The earlier frustration simmered, waiting to erupt.

“Kid, you’re lucky I’ve taken interest in your woman. Name your price—I’ll give anything for that beauty beside you.” The fat man leered at Lü Mei.

Guan Yu handed the sushi to Qian Yaoyao. Food deserved respect, never waste. Stepping forward, he asked flatly, “Any condition?”

“Yes. Just name it.”

“Your life. Reasonable, no?”

The fat man gaped. “You’re mocking me! Seeking death!”

“Exactly. Call your friends downstairs. We’ll settle this outside. Want my woman? Crush me first.”

As they exited, the fat man trailed closely while his companion fetched the bearded accomplice. Outside, Guan Yu’s figure blurred—a sudden kick sent the fat man flying into a wall like a fleshy cannonball.

“Fuck! You ambushed me!” The man scrambled up, only to be kicked again, blood spraying as he collided with the emerging bearded duo.

Guan Yu slapped the dazed men senseless. “Toads don’t bite, but they sure know how to annoy. Remember this lesson.”

**Chapter 2027: A Belly Full of Frustration**

The bearded man, a novice cultivator, seethed at the humiliation. As Guan Yu turned to leave, the man lunged with a stolen kitchen knife.

Patrons gasped—until Guan Yu’s backward kick sent the attacker crumpling, groin-first.

Lü Mei stuck out her tongue mockingly at the defeated trio. The stunned crowd murmured—who’d have guessed the meek-seeming youth hid such prowess?

“As your saying goes,” the owner remarked to his starstruck server, “never judge by appearances.”

***

Qian Yaoyao fumed all the way back. “Ruined meal! Those trash—”

“They’re dealt with,” Wei Hongwei soothed, offering sushi. “Try this?”

“Save it for tonight’s snack.”

Women, Guan Yu mused, truly had separate stomachs for treats.

They settled on “Seafood King” restaurant—grilled, fried, stewed oceanic fare. Wei Hongwei’s seating joke earned him a pinch from Qian Yaoyao. “Mention that again and die!”

Post-feast, beach antics exhausted them. Sunset gilded the sands briefly before twilight chilled the air.

“BBQ?” Wei Hongwei suggested at a bustling stall.

Guan Yu vetoed beer—seafood and sea wind bred gout.

Back at the hotel, the women claimed a room, banishing the men. “Wasting resources!” Wei Hongwei grumbled before submitting to Qian Yaoyao’s glare.

**Chapter 2028: Wasted Resources**

Next morning at Ancient City’s grandeur, Qian Yaoyao’s phone rang—her brother Qian Yunqing reported their Peace Street internet café trashed by twenty hoodlums.

At the vandalized site, Qian Yunqing explained: “Masked men injured customers. Police are investigating.”

Li Yuan arrived, smirking. “Who’d you piss off, Yunqing?”

Guan Yu’s kick sent him sprawling before cops emerged. “Leash your mutt,” Guan Yu coldly advised the officers.

Li Yuan scrambled to accuse, but the damage was done—suspicion pointed squarely at Ma Hai’s faction. Retribution brewed beneath Guan Yu’s calm exterior.
