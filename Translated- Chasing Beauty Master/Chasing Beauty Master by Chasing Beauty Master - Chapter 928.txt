“Child, you must live on bravely. Even though I have cancer, I face life with courage. We must live courageously – only with courage in our hearts can we truly survive.”

It was because of these words from my mother that I found the strength to keep living. Amei could only come out for one hour each day, the remaining time spent caring for her bedridden mother whose cancer required constant attention.

If she failed to find food during that single hour, she would starve the entire day. Often, Amei stayed awake through the night, sneaking out while her mother slept to scavenge. Yet even then, returning late meant finding her mother soiled and helpless.

**Chapter 2373: Past Events (Part 2)**

One evening outside a lavish restaurant, Amei lingered hoping for scraps. A portly middle-aged man stumbled out, drunk and retching violently. Amei didn’t flee – her gaze locked onto the whole chicken leg clutched in his hand.

As the man finished vomiting, he noticed her. “Well, a little beggar!” he slurred, peeling greasy hair from her face. “My, aren’t you a pretty thing under all that grime? Come with Uncle, and I’ll give you chicken legs every day!”

The man’s grip tightened on her shoulder. Though filth obscured Amei’s features, her luminous eyes and slender frame betrayed her beauty. She knew what following him entailed, but hunger left no choice – perhaps this morsel could ease her mother’s suffering.

Dragged back to his table, the drunkard boasted to friends while ordering a servant to “clean up this stray.” When groping hands descended, Amei recalled her mother’s words: “Live with courage and dignity.”

Even as calloused palms pawed her, she fought. A desperate bite earned her a thunderous slap. Dazed, ears ringing, she closed her eyes awaiting worse...

Then warmth.

A gentle voice asked, “Are you alright, little sister?”

Opening her eyes, Amei saw him – a young man with a smile like dawn breaking storm clouds. Guan Yu.

**Chapter 2374: Past Events (Part 3)**

Guan Yu had intervened, thrashing the drunkards. After feeding Amei, he arranged her bath. When she emerged, scrubbed clean despite malnourished pallor, even he caught his breath – beneath the grime hid startling beauty.

He drove her home to a crumbling shack, its roof gaping like an open wound. Inside lay her mother – skeletal, blind, cancerous rot consuming her left eye. Guan Yu immediately summoned medical help.

Doctors declared the cancer terminal, but Guan Yu paid for treatments. When her mother finally passed, Amei used his funds to search for him across cities.

Fate intervened when a director spotted her. Though refusing acting roles (“Makeup might hide me from Guan Yu”), she embraced singing. Her debut album skyrocketed her fame – not for glory, but to be visible enough for Guan Yu to find.

Years later, during a nationwide tour, rumors led her to City A. There, she finally reunited with her savior – now amnesiac, yet unchanged in appearance.

**Chapter 2375: Unknown Caller**

“Guan Yu,” Amei ventured hesitantly, “How old are you?”

He paused. Since awakening in an Arctic ice cave a year prior, his past remained fogged. “Truthfully... I don’t know. Should ask my sisters.”

She nestled closer. “It doesn’t matter. You’ll always be my Guan Yu.”

Unknown to them both, Guan Yu’s agelessness stemmed from emerging years prior from a mystical mirror. His journey – from rescuing Amei at fourteen to losing memories in frozen wastes – wove threads of destiny neither fully grasped.

As Amei’s star blazed, she’d leveraged fame to seek him, unaware media-shy Guan Yu recognized no celebrities. Yet through relentless searching, their paths converged again – proof that courage, once kindled, outshines even time’s riddles.
