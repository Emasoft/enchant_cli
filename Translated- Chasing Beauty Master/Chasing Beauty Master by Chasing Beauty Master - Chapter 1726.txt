The next day, Guan Yu (Guardian of the Universe) learned the Bulu Clan (Bulu Tribe) had endured a fierce and chaotic battle the previous night, now quieted. He initially intended to investigate, chiefly to determine whether Ling Su (Soaring Revival) had perished—a favorable outcome if true.

Ling Su (Soaring Revival) rode alone on a camel, relying on memory to return to the Ha Clan (Ha Tribe). Upon arrival, he collapsed from exhaustion and blood loss, compounded by a day and night without water or food. His body, pushed beyond limits, finally succumbed to unconsciousness.

Discovered by clansmen, Ma Zhagen (Firmly Rooted) swiftly ordered Ling Su carried indoors. “First tend to his wounds,” Ma Zhagen instructed. “We’ll question him after he wakes.” The severity of Ling Su’s injuries hinted at grave circumstances, and Ha Da Bei (Northern Hada)’s absence deepened unease. Though improbable, Ma Zhagen suspected the Jiayi Sect (Sect of Added Anomalies) behind this assault.

Ling Su remained unconscious for nearly two days, awakening at dusk. Ma Zhagen and the clan elder arrived promptly. The elder, voice heavy, asked, “Can you recount what transpired?”

Ling Su nodded. “The Bulu Clan’s elder received us, but mid-discussion, the Jiayi Sect stormed in. Despite being outnumbered, Ha Da Bei and our warriors pressed the attack. We were lured into a narrow passage where they barricaded us with shields and spears. Behind their lines, over a hundred cultivators gathered, channeling spells. I managed to cast a protective shield against their first assault, but a hidden master among them unleashed another wave. We were all struck—I barely escaped with severe wounds. Ha Da Bei... some perished, others were captured.”

His voice trailed off, masking private relief at surviving. The elder sank into a chair, expressionless, while Ma Zhagen grimaced at the Jiayi Sect’s calculated brutality.

“Are you certain Ha Da Bei lives?” Ma Zhagen pressed.

“I saw him captured,” Ling Su affirmed, feigning remorse. Privately, he vowed never to risk himself again.

Ling Su continued, “We walked into a trap. The Bulu Clan was annihilated, and the Jiayi Sect anticipated our aid. They amassed cultivators to ambush us—we were utterly deceived.”

“Vermin!” Ma Zhagen spat.

The elder sighed. “Our past victories bred complacency. We underestimated their resolve to counterattack. Had I foreseen this...”

“Father,” Ma Zhagen interjected, “let me lead a rescue!”

The elder hesitated, aware of the Jiayi Sect’s cultivator advantage. Yet clan honor demanded action. “Take a strong force tomorrow. Succeed without fail. Postpone the annual Strongman Trials.”

Ling Su cautioned, “A rash strike plays into their readiness. Wait until their vigilance wanes. Ha Da Bei won’t be harmed quickly—they’ll preserve him for leverage.”

The elder concurred. “Prepare thoroughly, Ma Zhagen. Depart only when ready.”

Though impatient, Ma Zhagen agreed. Ha Da Bei’s capture gnawed at him, but haste risked disaster.

The Ha Clan mobilized, reeling from the Jiayi Sect’s unprecedented aggression and the Bulu Clan’s eradication. Ma Zhagen drilled every warrior, honing them for assault.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s group arrived at the Bulu Clan’s ruins—charred remnants and weeping children replacing yesterday’s hostility. The stench of blood lingered, corpses demanding swift burial to avert plague.

“Who are you?” a frail elder demanded—the Bulu Clan’s surviving leader.

“Passersby offering aid,” Wang Jun (King’s Descendant) replied.

Guan Yu added, “We mean no harm. Let us assist with the dead.”

The elder relented, guiding them to an intact tent. “The Jiayi Sect slaughtered us last night. Witness this cruelty... and help us rebuild.”

Elsewhere, the Jiayi Sect celebrated Ha Da Bei’s capture. Instead of imprisonment, he received lavish treatment—healing arts mended his wounds, and attendants catered to his needs. That night, a masked woman entered his chamber.

Removing her serpent visage, the Jiayi Sect’s leader—a formidable cultivator—seduced him. “I desire you,” she purred, entwining around him. “Serve me, and enjoy paradise.”

Ha Da Bei, ensnared by her allure, pledged loyalty. Days of indulgence eroded his allegiance to the Ha Clan.

“Retrieve your clan’s secret manual for me,” she later entreated.

“I’ll try,” he vowed, though clueless to its location.

**Chapter 4516: Can You Do It?**

Ling Su’s wounds healed with spiritual energy. Meanwhile, the Jiayi Sect’s leader probed Ha Da Bei about the manual, suspecting it lay with the elder or Ma Zhagen.

Ma Zhagen, after days of preparation, marched with two hundred warriors to attack the Jiayi Sect—only to find their camp abandoned save for a few tents. They rescued Ha Da Bei, who feigned gratitude. “Thank heavens! That den of savagery...”

As Ma Zhagen’s force retreated triumphantly, the Jiayi Sect launched their true strike—raiding the undefended Ha Clan.

**Chapter 4517: Adjustments**

Ma Zhagen’s “victory” masked fatal miscalculation. The Jiayi Sect, forewarned, had shifted forces to exploit the Ha Clan’s vulnerability. While Ma Zhagen reclaimed a traitor, his homeland faced annihilation.
