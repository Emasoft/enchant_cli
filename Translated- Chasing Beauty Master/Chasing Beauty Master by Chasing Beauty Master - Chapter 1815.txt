“I did tell you that, but after you absorbed the cultivation technique, you should’ve at least come in to help me organize it. It was a complete mess—I spent tremendous effort sorting it out,” the artifact spirit snapped irritably. “Especially since I’m not very familiar with this technique. Organizing it was particularly troublesome.”

“Looks like you managed just fine,” Guan Yu remarked with an indifferent shrug, leaving the artifact spirit speechless.

Truth be told, the Imperial Seal now served no other purpose than storing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Guan Yu couldn’t possibly ask Elder Jiu or Xuanming to help store spells within it, as they’d inevitably discover the technique and cause complications.

Coincidentally, the Eight-Sided Drum Technique comprised four volumes, and the Imperial Seal could precisely hold four cultivation methods. By storing the technique here, Guan Yu ensured no outsider would know of its existence, and its aura remained completely concealed—as if the artifact had been tailor-made for him.

Wang Xiaorong knew this secret, but Guan Yu trusted her not to betray him. The Demon Lord also knew Guan Yu possessed the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, though only one volume. Perhaps out of regard for Wang Xiaorong, he hadn’t exposed this to the Cloud Azure Sect.

Though the Demon Lord didn’t particularly favor Guan Yu, he recognized his rare talent. As someone who valued gifted individuals, the Demon Lord sought ways to recruit Guan Yu into the Demon Soul Sect, hence his tacit approval of Wang Xiaorong’s relationship with him.

Guan Yu said, “Earlier, you mentioned struggling to decipher this technique. Now that we have two volumes, you can study them thoroughly. When I finally cultivate it, the process will be smoother.”

“It’s not that simple,” the artifact spirit replied. “As I said before, this technique seems sentient—not just anyone who obtains it can cultivate it. In my view, one must absorb it into their body and meditate internally. These symbols are incomprehensible from mere external observation. Master, why not try absorbing one volume to see if you can cultivate it? Though divided into four parts, each can be absorbed separately.”

“No, I can’t cultivate this technique yet. The timing isn’t right,” Guan Yu refused. Practicing it now would alert Xuanming, risking confiscation and accusations of sect betrayal. Moreover, if word spread through the jianghu, countless troubles would follow—he had no desire to sleep with one eye open.

Even absorbing two volumes currently offered little benefit. His priority remained breaking the seal in his mind, which required patience until all four volumes were gathered. “I hope you can uncover clues about this technique’s mysteries beforehand,” Guan Yu pressed. “At least then, cultivation won’t be as cumbersome.”

The artifact spirit shook its head helplessly. “Apologies, Master. I can usually decipher stored spells—their texts and symbols reveal secrets, even demonic incantations. But these symbols defy understanding. Without absorption, their essence remains locked.”

“Then we’ll wait,” Guan Yu conceded. “Once I obtain the remaining volumes, we’ll study them together.” Withdrawing his consciousness from the Imperial Seal, he prepared to rest before tomorrow’s journey to the capital.

The mission’s difficulty remained uncertain. If the Eight-Sided Drum Technique lay hidden in the palace, establishing connections might ease its retrieval. Speed was crucial—he had to act before other sects arrived, especially the Demon Soul Sect, likely already infiltrating the palace with spies.

By noon the next day, Guan Yu lazily rose. Production of handheld crossbows continued briskly in the back mountain forest, now fully managed by Cloud Azure disciples without Elder Zhenyang’s assistance. Soon, every disciple would wield one, significantly boosting the sect’s combat strength.

Days earlier, Guan Yu had provided materials and blueprints for a small crossbow crafted under Wang Jun’s supervision. Matching Wang Xiaorong’s in size, this wasn’t for himself—it was Qiqi’s promised gift. After their long separation, this trinket would surely delight her, though less powerful than Wang Xiaorong’s, it surpassed ordinary models.

Recalling Qiqi’s delicate waist—soft as sponge—Guan Yu’s heart tingled. Arriving at Tiger Head Peak’s main hall to bid farewell to Xuanming, he noticed the sect master examining an unusual crossbow.

“Master, did Elder Wang craft that crossbow for you?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Sharp eyes as always!” Xuanming chuckled. “Elder Wang used White Mystic Steel before departing. What do you think?”

Guan Yu marveled at the stainless steel-like metal—a first in this realm. “Such splendid material! The aesthetics are remarkable.”

“Naturally. White Mystic Steel is rare and rigid, typically reserved for blades. Crafting something this intricate is extraordinary.”

Though Guan Yu found the gleaming white unsuitable for stealth—too conspicuous at night—he acknowledged its power. Reinforced with Xuanming’s premium beast sinew, its potency was undeniable.

“Master, if you have more White Mystic Steel, could you spare some?” Guan Yu asked bluntly. With Xuanming, directness prevailed—politeness yielded nothing.

“Do you fancy my crossbow?” Xuanming smiled. “I’ve some steel left, but the true marvel lies elsewhere.” He approached, revealing the bowstring. “This is Mandala Viper sinew—exceedingly rare. I’ll grant you steel, but replicating this weapon is impossible.”

“Mandala Viper?”

“A formidable demonic beast,” Xuanming explained, firing a bolt at a stone pillar. The arrowhead embedded deeply, its tip flattened upon extraction. “Their sinew offers unmatched elasticity. Paired with White Mystic Steel, this crossbow’s power is unmatched.”

Noting Xuanming’s defensive tone about the sinew’s scarcity, Guan Yu pressed, “Even without the sinew, the steel would suffice.”

“This invention—” Xuanming admired the crossbow, “—requires no spiritual energy. Even mortals wield deadly force. Though infusing qi enhances it further.”

“Indeed. Master, shouldn’t such contributions be rewarded?”

Xuanming sighed. “You’ve already enriched yourself with treasures. What more could entice you?”

“Those were fair trades,” Guan Yu retorted, producing previous acquisitions. “Shall we revert them?”

“Enough!” Xuanming waved him off. “Name your reward.”

“Disciples whisper about my unrewarded service. Proper incentives motivate better than endless punishments.”

Xuanming grimaced. Cloud Azure’s strictness stifled initiative—a reward system might indeed spark vigor. “Very well. What do you desire?”

Guan Yu grinned. “Who refuses more treasures? Perhaps that White Mystic Steel…”
