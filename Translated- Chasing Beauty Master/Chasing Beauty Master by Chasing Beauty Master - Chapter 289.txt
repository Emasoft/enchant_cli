“The capital is vast, with intricate alleyways and roads. How could I possibly know so many people?” Wen Qing chuckled at Guan Yu's remark.

“Alright, but she's also a teacher at our school. Didn’t you know?” Guan Yu said.

Wen Qing froze for a moment, pondered, then suddenly slapped her thigh. “I remember now! Isn’t she the woman who appeared at our villa? I recall her disheveled appearance leaving your room. Hmph, so you’ve been involved all along and didn’t admit it.”

“We weren’t involved back then, okay?” Guan Yu said bitterly. Women sure hold grudges.

“Ah, husband, how are you so charming? If women keep flocking to you, what am I supposed to do as your first wife?” Wen Qing feigned melancholy.

Guan Yu’s expression turned peculiar.

Wen Qing, ever sharp, noticed his odd look and suddenly understood. She shrieked, “Husband, am I not your first wife?”

“Uh…” Guan Yu scratched his head awkwardly. “You’d be the second wife.”

“Second wife?” Wen Qing hadn’t expected this. She lunged from the passenger seat, clawing at Guan Yu. “Who’s the first?!”

“Stop messing around—I’m driving!” Guan Yu struggled to steady the car.

“Hmph, your little friend down there isn’t behaving,” Wen Qing teased, then gasped. “Is your first wife Feng Xin? I’ll be bullied to death by her!”

Guan Yu grimaced. “No, it’s not Feng Xin.”

“Then who?!” Wen Qing pressed.

“You’ll meet her soon,” Guan Yu evaded.

Wen Qing sighed dramatically. “I’m just a second wife… destined to be bullied by the first.”

Guan Yu nearly swerved into the curb. Women’s logic!

After three days, the semester began. Campus buzzed with life. As Guan Yu walked to his dorm, he anticipated reuniting with his roommates. Little did he know, a confrontation was unfolding over his bed.

“Wang Zhen, these two students need beds in your room,” declared Qian Younian, a basketball team captain and campus official.

“No vacancies here!” Wang Zhen refused.

Qian Younian sneered. “Don’t lie. These beds have been empty since last year.”

Tensions escalated. Qian Younian’s men began moving belongings into the room. Wang Zhen erupted, tossing their items to the floor. “Get out!”

Qian Younian smirked. “You’re defying orders. Boys—teach him a lesson!”

Ten thugs stormed in, wielding clubs. Wang Zhen fought valiantly but was overwhelmed, beaten to the ground.

Amid the chaos, Wang Zhen seized a chance. He lunged at Qian Younian, pummeling him. “Sneaky bastard! Think you can outplay me?!”

Qian Younian’s thugs retaliated, clubbing Wang Zhen’s head. Dazed, Wang Zhen staggered but landed final blows on Qian Younian’s face.

“Kill him!” Qian Younian roared, bloodied and enraged.

As the thugs closed in, a cold voice cut through the room: “Touch my brother again, and you’ll regret it.”

Guan Yu stood in the doorway, eyes blazing. The thugs froze. With lightning speed, Guan Yu disarmed them, bones cracking under his fists. Within moments, all ten lay moaning on the floor.

Qian Younian trembled. Guan Yu loomed over him. “You dare harm my friend? Your face isn’t the only thing that’ll be broken.”

The price for crossing Guan Yu’s brother had come due.
