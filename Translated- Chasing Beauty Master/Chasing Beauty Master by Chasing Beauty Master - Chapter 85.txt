Though seated by the wall not far away, Guan Yu could see every inch of the two women’s exposed skin and figures with startling clarity. Ka~

Niu Le resembled an overexcited child, his eyes alight with eager curiosity as he explored their bodies with large, roaming hands. The women gasped and whimpered under his touch.

“Heh…Brother, want a turn?” Niu Le glanced back at Guan Yu, whispering his suggestion.

“Keep it to yourself!” Guan Yu rolled his eyes irritably, turning away to smoke with sullen intensity.

He watched as Niu Le peeled off their last scraps of underwear and pounced eagerly. Just as Guan Yu, flushed and flustered, rose to escape to the sofa, Niu Le’s abrupt groan startled him.

“Huh…?” Guan Yu gaped at Niu Le, who now trembled with closed eyes and lifted chin. Words failed him—how could this oaf finish so quickly?

“Damn! That’s it?” Guan Yu exclaimed, dumbfounded.

“Pathetic. Barely brushed the thigh root, didn’t even enter, and you’re done? First time?” The blonde woman, interrupted mid-passion, glared at Niu Le. She’d spread her legs eagerly, only to be abandoned at the threshold.

“I…” Niu Le stammered crimson-faced before collapsing beside her, coughing awkwardly. He shot Guan Yu a sheepish grin.

The blonde sat up, tossing her hair. After a derisive glance at Niu Le, she smirked at Guan Yu while wiping herself. “Handsome, why not play with us?”

“No…I’m sick!” Guan Yu blurted, recoiling from their predatory gazes.

“We’ll use protection…”

“Can’t. It hurts. Wait—this guy recovers fast!” He jabbed a thumb at Niu Le.

As the women stalked naked to the bathroom, Guan Yu burst into laughter.

“Brother, stop! I just…got too excited!” Niu Le scratched his head, clad only in boxers.

Ten minutes later, breathy moans echoed from the bathroom. Exchanging glances, they crept to peek through the door crack.

The women, left unsatisfied, had turned to each other…

“Your mess,” Guan Yu sighed.

“Want a threesome?” he asked Niu Le.

“N-no!” The latter shook his head vigorously, all desire spent.

Guan Yu pushed the door open.

“Join us?” The flushed women beckoned.

“Dress and leave. We’re resting,” he commanded.

“What?” The brunette looked up confused from her crouched position.

“Out. Now!” Guan Yu barked, suppressing his own arousal.

Thus concluded the most frustrating gig of the escorts’ careers—rejected by one, disappointed by another. They muttered curses as they departed.

Meanwhile, Du Xueheng’s room echoed with vigorous activity.

“What? He didn’t do it? Finished instantly?” Du Xueheng laughed uproariously atop his companion. “Old Zhao, you called it! Those boys are greenhorns!”

“Their loss,” Zhao leered, dragging the scorned women into his bed…

Dawn found Guan Yu practicing Bone-Shattering Fist before joining the group. Smirks and knowing glances greeted them.

“Sleep well?” Professor Lin sneered.

“Soundly,” Guan Yu replied coolly.

Li Yunshan arranged travel documents efficiently. By afternoon, papers were ready.

“Shall we depart?” Li proposed. The convoy crossed into Myanmar by dusk, tires kicking up dust on pitted roads.

“There—the drilling machines. That’s the old mining pit,” Li pointed.

After formalities with the white-haired mine owner, the group settled in a modest hotel.

“Tomorrow we select stones!” Li declared.

At the cluttered warehouse next morning, Professor Lin began scrutinizing raw jade with specialized instruments. Guan Yu discreetly activated his detection ability.

“Hmm…skilled,” he admitted privately. Lin’s selected stones included one promising piece amidst mediocre specimens.

“This large striated stone could multiply our investment a thousandfold!” Lin proclaimed dramatically.

Guan Yu’s eyebrows shot up at the 2 million yuan price tag—nearly matching premium carved jade’s value.

“You’re buying this?” he asked Du Xueheng.

“Risk brings reward!” Du retorted.

As others selected stones, Li approached Guan Yu. “Care to partner? 70-30 split after costs.”

“50-50, or I work alone,” Guan Yu countered.

Li clasped his shoulder. “You honor me, brother.”

Their pact sealed, Guan Yu prepared to outshine conventional methods with his unique sight.
