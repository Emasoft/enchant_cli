“What does it mean to be a celebrity?” Guan Yu wondered, turning to look. In the distance, a pristine white-painted carriage approached—strikingly elegant and immaculate. Its grandeur suggested the arrival of someone eminent. The carriage, drawn by two leisurely horses, was surrounded by a bustling crowd, predominantly young women. Had guards not restrained them, these admirers might have leaped onto the carriage in their eagerness to glimpse its occupant.

As the white carriage drew nearer, Guan Yu’s curiosity deepened. “Who could command such adoration?” he murmured.

“Who’s in that carriage? Such a spectacle!” Guan Yu asked a ticket collector nearby.

The man shot him a disdainful glance. “You don’t know? Must be an outsider.”

Though irritated by the man’s tone, Guan Yu nodded. There was no point hiding his unfamiliarity with the capital’s affairs.

“That’s Chu Fan—the star of the Vermilion Theater. The biggest sensation in the capital these past six months,” the man declared, as if the name alone should awe anyone.

Guan Yu remained unfazed, earning a scornful snort. “Country bumpkin,” the man muttered under his breath, clearly offended by Guan Yu’s indifference toward Chu Fan, whom he revered.

“Chu Fan…” Guan Yu repeated. The name meant nothing to him, though it was no surprise in a city teeming with luminaries. What intrigued him was Chu Fan’s affiliation with the Vermilion Theater—the very establishment Guan Yu aimed to acquire at the auction.

Chu Fan’s carriage halted before the Classic Auction House. The crowd parted respectfully, allowing him to bypass the queue—a privilege reserved for the capital’s darlings. The coachman, a youth in neat gray-blue attire, opened the carriage door.

Out stepped a figure who immediately struck Guan Yu with his striking presence. Clad in a spotless white robe draped with a crimson cloak, Chu Fan stood tall—nearly 190 centimeters, surpassing Guan Yu’s own height. His slender frame, refined features, and pale complexion bordered on feminine, yet his bearing exuded masculine vigor. With a charming smile, he waved to admirers, basking in their adulation.

“Interesting,” Guan Yu mused, watching Chu Fan glide into the auction house unchallenged. While Guan Yu prided himself on his rugged handsomeness, Chu Fan’s ethereal beauty belonged to a different realm—one that might appeal to wealthy patrons seeking ornamentation over substance.

Chapter 4763: Don’t Block the Way

After purchasing an admission ticket—a mere one tael of silver, yet a clever revenue stream for the auction house—Guan Yu entered a sprawling courtyard. The open-air venue buzzed with hundreds of attendees. A raised platform at the front served as the auction stage, flanked by reserved tables for dignitaries. Chu Fan already occupied one, surrounded by opulently dressed patrons.

Suddenly, commotion erupted as two burly men shoved through the crowd, clearing a path. “Make way! Don’t block the road!” Behind them rushed a young woman in a white gown—Miss Jiang, a nobleman’s daughter and ardent Chu Fan devotee. Her arrival, marked by entitled disregard, hinted at her family’s influence.

Despite her beauty and poise—rivaling even Qiqi’s—Miss Jiang’s eager approach met Chu Fan’s aloofness. He barely acknowledged her, his gaze fixed on the stage. Guan Yu found the interaction peculiar; most men would revel in such attention, yet Chu Fan seemed indifferent—or perhaps adept at playing hard to get.

Chapter 4764: A Rare Treasure

The auction commenced with trinkets and dubious elixirs until a small box unveiled a fist-sized black crystal. Its obsidian sheen glimmered mysteriously, captivating the crowd. To cultivators, this was no mere gem—it was a rare Black Crystal, invaluable for forging spiritual artifacts.

Guan Yu’s interest sharpened. Having encountered such crystals in Miao City’s caverns, he knew their worth. Here, in the heart of the capital, this stone could spark a frenzy among cultivators willing to bankrupt themselves for it.

As bidding escalated, Guan Yu’s mind drifted to his true objective: the Vermilion Theater. Today, he would secure it, regardless of cost. Let Chu Fan bask in fleeting fame—Guan Yu’s ambitions lay in legacy, not limelight.
