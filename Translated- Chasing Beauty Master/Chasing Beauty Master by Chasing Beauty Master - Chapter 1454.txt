“Moreover, even if we disregard personal sentiments, we must consider the face of the Buddha. Xiao Zhi is the son of Chief Zheng. Can we truly show no mercy and directly condemn him to death? Have you forgotten all the meritorious service Chief Zheng has rendered to the Cloud Azure Sect over these many years?”

**Chapter 3788: No Leniency**

“I, too, am reluctant,” Xuanming replied, his voice heavy. “But he is now afflicted by the demonic sect’s sinister arts. If we do not abolish his cultivation, won’t he risk transforming into a monstrous beast at any moment? This would harm both others and himself. Rest assured, I will personally oversee the process, taking utmost care to avoid damaging his meridians. Afterwards… we can only hope he rebuilds his foundation from scratch.”

Having made his decision, Xuanming’s resolve was unshakable. Chief Lu knew further pleas would be futile. Xiao Zhi’s cultivation was beyond saving. The question now was whether the young man could endure this tribulation.

“Once this matter is settled,” Xuanming declared, “gather all disciples for thorough inspections. Show no leniency to any anomalies.”

Chief Lu recognized the genuine fury beneath Xuanming’s calm. After departing, he ascended Suspended Peak to meet Chief Zheng. None grieved more deeply than the father. “Senior Brother Lu,” Chief Zheng asked quietly, “what did the Sect Leader say?”

“The boy’s life may be spared,” Chief Lu replied, “but the Sect Leader insists on abolishing his cultivation. He vows to preserve Xiao Zhi’s meridians, hoping the child can start anew once healed.”

Chief Zheng nodded grimly. This bitter remedy was necessary. He understood the demonic energy had rooted itself in Xiao Zhi’s core. Without purging his current cultivation, the corruption would fester, triggering repeated transformations.

“My gratitude for your intercession, Senior Brother Lu, and for believing in the boy.”

“No thanks are needed. I’ve watched Xiao Zhi grow—I know his character. My greater concern lies with Guan Yu. Where might he be now? No matter. I must return.”

**Chapter 3789: Courageous Resolve**

Unaware of Xiao Zhi’s plight at the Cloud Azure Sect, Guan Yu grew uneasy. Two days had passed without word from his companion. Xiao Zhi had merely mentioned “taking a walk”—where could he have gone? Had danger struck?

Though Xiao Zhi’s cultivation surpassed most in this region controlled by the Demon Soul Sect, perhaps other matters delayed him. Resolving to proceed, Guan Yu set his course for the sect stronghold. The Demon Lord coveted his Eight-Sided Drum Technique, but Guan Yu would never surrender it. If the Demon Lord could break the seal in his mind… that would warrant gratitude.

Within the Demon Soul Sect, Wang Xiaorong confronted the Left Envoy. “What did you do to Xiao Zhi?” she demanded. “Why did he transform?”

“The Young Mistress’s informants prove efficient,” the Left Envoy smiled. “But this matter concerns the Cloud Azure Sect. Why interrogate me?”

“The Blood Toxin resides solely in your possession!” Xiaorong retorted. “Don’t deny it—Xiao Zhi transformed publicly upon returning! Who else could be responsible?”

The Left Envoy spread his hands. “Though I alone hold the toxin, its contagion spreads through carriers. How Xiao Zhi contracted it remains unknown to me.”

“Swear this isn’t your doing!”

“By what motive would I target Xiao Zhi, knowing your friendship? If seeking pawns within the Cloud Azure Sect, countless candidates exist. Why choose him?”

Xiaorong relented. The Left Envoy never deceived her—if guilty, he’d boast rather than deny. As she turned to leave, he added, “Guan Yu approaches. He’s been granted passage through the green channel.”

“If he learns of this…” Xiaorong sighed. “I almost wish he wouldn’t come.”

“Rumors suggest the Cloud Azure Sect recalls Guan Yu to answer for Xiao Zhi’s ‘crimes.’ With Xiao Zhi condemned, Guan Yu’s fate appears equally bleak—especially bearing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Should he remain here after arriving, he might escape their punishment.”

“Truly?” Hope flickered in Xiaorong’s eyes. “Though I long for him to stay, his stubborn pride would never permit it. Even abandoning his sect, he’d refuse our sanctuary.”

The Left Envoy shook his head. “Knowing this inevitability, why torment yourself? Righteous and Demonic paths cannot coexist. What future exists between you?”

Xiaorong departed without reply. Her heart clung to fantasies—eloping to distant lands, abandoning status and luxury for humble life with Guan Yu. Yet these were mere daydreams. Even if she renounced everything, Guan Yu’s quest to break his seal took precedence.

She vowed patience. When Guan Yu someday reached the Zenith Realm’s pinnacle, perhaps then they could unite. Until that distant dawn, she could only wait.

**Chapter 3790: No Underhanded Deeds**

As Cloud Azure messengers scoured the realm for Guan Yu, none anticipated his arrival at the Demon Soul Sect’s gates.

“You’ve come,” Xiaorong greeted warmly, having dismissed the guards. “I’ve waited long.”

Guanyu surveyed the soaring peaks. “Impressive stronghold. Do you truly scale these cliffs daily?”

“Fool!” Xiaorong laughed. “We descend by flight! Who climbs like a mortal?”

“Ah… yes, of course.” Guan Yu masked embarrassment—his shaky swordcraft had forced the arduous trek.

“Come. Father awaits.”

In the grand hall, the Demon Lord observed his guest. “Your courage merits praise, daring to approach alone. For this boldness, I toast you.”

Guan Yu drained his cup. “You honor me.”

“A man of bearing!” The Demon Lord refilled their cups. “For saving my daughter, another toast.”

After three rounds, the mood shifted. “Previously, you vowed to protect Xiaorong,” the Demon Lord challenged. “Yet she faced grave peril under your watch. Are you all valor without competence?”

“Father!” Xiaorong interjected.

“The fault was mine,” Guan Yu admitted. “I overestimated my capabilities.”

“Nonsense!” Xiaorong countered. “I acted recklessly. Why claim blame?”

The Demon Lord pressed, “Boldness without strength serves no one. Can you truly safeguard her?”

Xiaorong gulped wine to deflect tension, coughing violently. Guan Yu steadied her. “Why force yourself?”

“First times… require courage,” she rasped.

“Guan Yu,” the Demon Lord continued, “your presence here risks Cloud Azure’s wrath. Can innocence withstand slander? Consider Xiao Zhi—”

“Xiao Zhi? What of him?” Guan Yu tensed.

“He returned to your sect with Yanzhao. Two days past, before the entire assembly, Blood Toxin triggered his transformation. Chief Zheng himself struck him unconscious.”

“Blood Toxin?!” Guan Yu surged to his feet. “Your doing!”

“Baseless accusation!” Xiaorong cried. “Hear the full account!”

The Demon Lord’s gaze hardened. “Though branded evil, I disdain underhanded poisons. The toxin spreads through contamination—perhaps Xiao Zhi contacted an infected carrier. Believe as you will.”

“Lies! Only your sect possesses it!”

“Contrary to your belief,” the Demon Lord stated coldly, “Blood Toxin’s contagion spreads through tainted blood. A single drop may corrupt.”

The revelation struck Guan Yu silent. Horrifying implications unfolded—Xiao Zhi’s plight might stem from accidental exposure rather than deliberate malice. Yet this truth offered little comfort. The damage was done.
