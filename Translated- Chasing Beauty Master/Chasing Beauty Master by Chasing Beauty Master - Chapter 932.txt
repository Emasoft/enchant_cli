“Exactly, it’s all about one’s background. Who can compete when his dad’s such a badass? But I heard that just before the break, Ge Yinglai (Revolutionary Hero) became even more brazen. He’d loiter at the school gates, spotting pretty juniors, then flash cash to ‘invite’ them to the cafeteria. Plenty were practically dragged there by force.”

“Really? Good heavens, that’s outrageous!” another voice exclaimed in shock.

“Comparisons will drive you mad. We can only envy those born lucky,” someone sighed.

Listening, Guan Yu (Passerby of Fate) realized the school’s troublemakers had resurged during his absence. Yet he no longer cared to intervene—those cafeteria affairs, especially involving girls who willingly went, were beyond his control. If they chose that path, they knew the risks. Still, Ge’s audacity to snatch students at the gates crossed a line. Guan Yu resolved to call Wei Hongwei (Grand Ambition) later, urging him to handle it. If Wei and Jia Bo (Wave) failed, he’d confront Ge himself. As for Young Master Feng, Guan Yu would deal with him in due time.

Soon, servers arrived with their orders. “Enjoy your meal,” they smiled before departing. Qu Shuangshuang (Double Frost), eyes sparkling, declared, “This looks divine! I’m diving in first!”

“Go ahead. Order more if needed,” Guan Yu chuckled.

“Brother Guan Yu,” Shuangshuang mumbled between bites, “after your errands today… could you pick me up?” Xue Jing (Quiet Snow) sighed inwardly—the meal’s true purpose had surfaced.

“Pick you up? Don’t you stay nights at the hospital with your mother?”

“To take me to your place, of course! I’ll stay over—it’s not the first time anyway. Mom’s legs are better now. She can manage alone.” Shuangshuang emphasized “not the first time” loudly, ensuring Xue Jing heard.

“Well…” Guan Yu hesitated. Outright refusal would hurt her, yet inviting her home risked scandal.

“If you’re busy,” Shuangshuang offered slyly, “just give me your address. I’ll take a taxi!”

She knew Guan Yu liked her but hesitated due to Xue Jing’s presence. Undeterred, Shuangshuang pressed on—this was her chance for happiness.

“What do you mean ‘not the first time’?” Guan Yu feigned confusion.

“Sleeping together! We’ve done it before. Tonight, I’ll share your bed again.” She popped a beef morsel into her mouth, rehearsed lines flowing smoothly.

“Enough! You’re too young for such talk,” Guan Yu chided, though two eavesdropping boys behind him swiveled, drawn by the girl’s melodious voice discussing sleepovers.

One glimpsed Shuangshuang’s doll-like charm—twin braids framing a face as sweet as her tone. He nudged his friend, whispering, “Check out the hottie behind us!”

The other turned, spotting Xue Jing too. “Two beauties?! Who’s that guy? Heaven’s unfair—give me one looker at least!”

Guan Yu ignored their envy. Let fools chatter—he’d no time for petty confrontations.

“I’m serious!” Shuangshuang pressed. “If I’m not shy, why should you be?”

As Guan Yu focused on his steak, Xue Jing’s appetite vanished. As his “first wife,” she couldn’t let this slide. “Shuangshuang, exactly how did you ‘sleep’ together? Do tell—I’m curious.”

“Sister Xue Jing!” Shuangshuang faux-blushed. “It’s embarrassing with strangers here. I’ll share details tonight at home—just family then!”

“You boasted earlier like it’s a trophy. Why shy now?” Xue Jing’s barbed tone cut air.

“Of course I’m proud!” Shuangshuang countered. “Being with Brother Guan Yu is a blessing! Don’t you feel proud too when with him?”

Xue Jing reddened. “You’re too young for this! Focus on studies. His household’s crowded enough.”

“I’m hardly younger than you! Sister Ling’er said his youngest wife’s a year my junior! Why can’t I join?” Shuangshuang retorted, devouring her steak as Xue Jing’s plate stayed untouched.

Guan Yu intervened, “Let’s discuss this later. We’re pressed for time.” He stood, grabbing takeout boxes.

As they moved to leave, a sneer came from behind: “Leaving so soon, pretty boy? Let us help with those girls!”

Guan Yu spun, backhanding the speaker. Blood sprayed across glass as the thug crashed into a table. Shuangshuang screamed at the gory sight.

“Who’s next?” Guan Yu growled, eyes cold. The restaurant froze—a storm had arrived.
