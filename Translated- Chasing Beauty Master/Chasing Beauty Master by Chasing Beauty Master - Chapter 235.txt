The dealer revealed his hand first. He had only taken two cards—a seven and an eight—totaling five points.

When it was Guan Yu’s turn to show his cards, he wore an expression of calm indifference. He picked up his three cards with practiced ease, ready to end the round swiftly.

The spectators found the moment thrilling, though far more nerve-wracking than Guan Yu seemed to feel. Their hearts pounded in their throats. None of them were wealthy; they gambled merely to escape the pressures of work and life. Yet instead of relief, they found themselves burdened deeper by losses. Few ever walked away victorious.

Some understood the futility, but gambling, like a drug, ensnared them. Families fractured, careers crumbled—yet they clung to desperate hope, their tension laced with fragile anticipation.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly, understanding their plight. With a flick of his wrist, he revealed his three cards.

The crowd gaped.

Two aces and a three of spades—five points. Another tie.

Stunned silence followed. The onlookers were genuinely bewildered, while Guan Yu feigned equal surprise. Having accidentally exposed his novice status, he had to play the fool to avoid suspicion from prying eyes.

“Another tie,” Niu Le muttered, rubbing his eyes as he stared at Guan Yu like the man had transformed into a celestial beauty. Guan Yu shifted uncomfortably.

“Back off,” Guan Yu snapped. “I told you to bet on ‘tie.’ Now you’re regretting it, huh?”

Regret didn’t begin to cover it. Niu Le’s guts churned with remorse. Had he bet a million—no, his entire fortune—on Guan Yu’s uncanny luck, his wealth would’ve octupled in minutes. Instead, he watched helplessly as Guan Yu’s 80,000 yuan ballooned to 640,000.

“Boss, don’t ditch me now!” Niu Le pleaded, clutching Guan Yu’s arm. “Whatever you bet next, I’ll follow without blinking!”

Guan Yu shuddered. “Let go, or I’ll leave you behind.”

The threat worked. Niu Le released him, eagerly rubbing his hands.

“Sir, your 640,000,” the dealer said, eyeing Guan Yu with newfound respect. Luck this potent was rare.

With a shrug, Guan Yu collected his winnings under envious gazes.

“Keep playing here or move tables?” Niu Le asked. Guan Yu’s luck felt unstoppable.

“Stay. Changing tables might break the streak,” Guan Yu declared.

The crowd brightened—music to their ears.

**Chapter 586: Winning Until His Hands Went Soft**

Regret gnawed at the gamblers. They’d seen Guan Yu hit a tie yet hadn’t followed, losing dearly. Now, hope rekindled as he stayed. Even the riskiest bets suddenly seemed worth tailing.

“Hurry up, dealer!” Niu Le barked, irritated by the man’s dazed hesitation.

“One moment,” the dealer stammered, fetching fresh cards. Sweat beaded his brow. If the crowd mirrored Guan Yu’s bets, the casino stood to hemorrhage money.

The round unfolded exactly as feared.

This time, Guan Yu shoved his entire 640,000 onto the “Player” zone. The crowd followed, though cautiously—their earlier losses made them stingy. A few defiant souls bet on “Banker,” but their paltry stacks paled against the mountain of chips on “Player.”

The dealer’s hands trembled.

“Flip the damn cards!” Niu Le slammed the table. “You’re wasting our time!”

The dealer jolted, wiping sweat before revealing a face card and an eight of clubs—eight points. Relief flickered across his face. Beating this required a nine—a rare feat.

Niu Le slumped. “Boss, my 100,000’s gone.”

Guan Yu smirked. “No faith? Luck’s still on my side.”

With a flourish, he flipped his cards: a face card and a nine of diamonds. Nine points. Player won.

“NINE?!” Niu Le leaped up, ecstatic. “Boss, I could kiss you!”

Guan Yu kicked him away. “Keep your distance.”

Image mattered. He puffed his chest, declaring, “I checked the almanac today—fortune smiles on me!”

Gamblers murmured. They’d consulted almanacs too, yet only Guan Yu reaped rewards. Truth was, following him guaranteed wins.

Winners cheered; losers shed their pride, vowing to mimic Guan Yu’s every move. Only the dealer despaired, drenched in sweat. This round cost the casino nearly 900,000 yuan. If this continued...

“Again!” Niu Le crowed, clutching his chips. One night’s losses had reversed, and the night was young.

The dealer reshuffled with shaking hands, praying the casino’s experts would intervene.

Guan Yu bet his entire 1.28 million on “Player.” The crowd, emboldened, followed suit—all-in.

“Banker” sat empty.

The dealer’s heart raced as he revealed a two of diamonds and four of hearts—six points.

Guan Yu nudged Niu Le. “Your turn to flip.”

Niu Le froze, then chanted Buddhist mantras under breath.

“Hurry up!” a spectator jeered.

“Shut it! This is ritual!” Niu Le snapped, slamming the cards—a king of clubs and six of spades. Six points. Another tie.

The crowd erupted. Those who’d bet on “tie” roared, their stakes octupled. Guan Yu’s 2.56 million became 20.48 million. Niu Le’s 320,000? A life-changing sum.

“Boss… we won?” Niu Le stammered, face flushed.

Guan Yu nodded. “Your luck’s turning.”

As Niu Le gathered the chips, a woman observed from a plush surveillance room. Barefoot, she sipped wine, her crimson lips curling.

“Fascinating,” purred Chu Hong, the casino’s owner.

Zhou Jin, her strategist, frowned at the screen. “Can’t tell if he’s cheating.”

Chu Hong laughed, her décolletage trembling. “Whether skill or luck, he’s cost me millions. But the night’s long.”

“Interest or lust?” Zhou Jin sneered.

“Both.” She strode out, intent on meeting this enigma.
