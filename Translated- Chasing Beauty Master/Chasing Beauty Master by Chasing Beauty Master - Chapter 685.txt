Some people spotted Guan Yu and the War God Ito behind the fiery and aquatic dragons through telescopes, sending shockwaves through Hakoto City's citizens. Even the Divine Emperor in his palace heard reports of the anomalies atop Mount Fuji. With a knowing smile, he nodded: "Guan Yu must have encountered War God Ito. When two titans meet, they naturally measure their strength. Heh, though our Eastern Isles have always lagged behind Huaxia in all aspects, this time when Guan Yu falls to War God Ito, we'll seize initiative in future collaborations."

Regarding War God Ito's capabilities, the Divine Emperor harbored absolute confidence. He had personally witnessed the warrior's power during a demonstration in the desolate Pacific waters - with mere gesture, Ito had summoned kilometer-high waves that stood suspended like liquid walls, then conjured a flaming dragon that vaporized the aqueous barrier into mist. Such power transcended mortal limits, cementing Ito's divine title.

The Divine Emperor ordered a high-powered telescope erected in his courtyard. Pressing his eye against the lens, he watched the aerial duel unfold.

None burned with greater excitement than Sakurako, though her vantage point mere hundred zhang away brought terrifying proximity. Even through hundreds of meters, the clashing auras of the combatants pressed down like metaphysical weights, stifling breath itself - not mere physical suppression, but primordial soul-crushing dominance.

Sakurako understood both warriors deliberately restrained their energies for her safety. The mere thought of their full-powered clash chilled her - thermonuclear blasts might pale before their unleashed fury.

Ito stood arrogantly behind his flaming dragon, hands clasped behind back: "Guan Yu! I've dedicated myself to fire attunement while you dabble in all five elements. In single-element combat, you cannot prevail. Unleash your full power! At this thousand-zhang altitude, we needn't fear collateral damage. Let us battle unrestrained!"

Truthfully, Guan Yu held little affection for Eastern Islanders, yet Ito's terse candor defied expectations.

"If full power becomes necessary, I'll oblige. But first, let's test whether your flame dragon or my water serpent reigns supreme."

Tilting his head skyward, Guan Yu loosed a resonant cry. A casual right-hand flick sent watery blade slicing through air toward Ito.

At their transcendent Realm Sovereign level, combatants wielded spiritual energy with surgical precision - no wasteful energy leakage as seen in lesser mutants' flashy brawls. Though the aqueous edge appeared merely foot-long and inch-wide, its deceptively plain facade concealed Guan Yu's condensed water essence.

War God Ito dared not underestimate a Realm Sovereign opponent. Roaring, he materialized fiery staff between palms and swung at the incoming blade.

Through his telescope, the Divine Emperor frowned at Guan Yu's diminutive water blade met by Ito's massive staff: "What trickery is this?"

The collision produced soft "boom" - less clamorous than third-class mutants brawling. Distant observers felt nothing, but Sakurako witnessed a ping-pong ball sized black dot manifest between weapons. Though tiny, its presence radiated cosmic dread - an all-devouring maw.

Within dozens of meters, air and vaporized combat energies rushed into the singularity before its collapse.

"Heavens! Was that... a black hole?!" Sakurako gasped.

Their first exchange had torn reality's fabric, birthing miniature singularity that swallowed collision noises whole.

Ito's shock mirrored Sakurako's. He'd heard of Realm Sovereigns tearing dimensional barriers to banish foes into chaotic streams, but witnessing it firsthand against Guan Yu chilled his marrow.

Yet before millions of countrymen, retreat spelled disgrace. Eastern Islanders revered strength, forgiving defeat but despising cowardice.

"RAAAAH!" War God Ito urged his flaming dragon forward.

Chapter 1741: Water-Fire Transmutation

Seeing Ito's fiery charge, Sakurako screamed: "Guan Yu! Beware!"

"Worry not. I'll resolve this in moments." Guan Yu's voice bloomed in her mind like whispered intimacy, calming her nerves.

The Divine Emperor noted Ito's failed first strike. Seeing renewed assault, he rejoiced despite himself.

At ten zhang's distance, Ito merged with his dragon, becoming humanoid inferno wreathed in flames seeking fiery embrace.

Conflagration dyed half the sky crimson, transforming moonlit night into blazing crucible. Mount Fuji's partially collapsed peak melted under Ito's radiance, snowmelt cascading downslope.

Spectators below like Hayakawa Shigeru suddenly sweltered in superheated air, scrambling for shade.

"Could Guan Yu withstand such might?" Hayakawa fretted.

Since Ito's return from divine trials, state propaganda deified him. Yet Hayakawa never sought tutelage despite proximity. Defeated by Guan Yu over Sakurako's courtship, he instead saw infinite cultivation horizons through the foreigner, resolving to become Guan Yu's disciple.

Perhaps Guan Yu's approachable aura or displayed prowess called stronger - Hayakawa knew instinctively whom to follow.

Guan Yu smiled serenely as flaming Ito closed. Only when searing heat licked his robes at three zhang did he raise hands, tracing circular sigil.

Below, millions felt primal agitation - fire's inherent ferocity stirring violent impulses.

Among five elements, fire reigned as most violent and destructive, water its gentle counter.

As Guan Yu completed his gesture, the blazing sky dimmed. Though still crimson, oppressive heat relented.

Between Guan Yu's palms swirled three-foot azure sphere. Though dwarfed by Ito's inferno, its cerulean glow suffused heaven and earth with glacial chill. Restless crowds stilled, minds entering profound calm. Many recalled past transgressions, spontaneously repenting to loved ones.

Though protected by Guan Yu's energy, Sakurako had nearly combusted earlier. Now, ambient flames transformed into cyan vapors entering her lungs. Her body underwent ineffable metamorphosis.

Ito raged impotently at three zhang's distance, three-zhang-tall fire avatar roaring as Guan Yu's azure sphere repelled all advances.

Guan Yu cradled the orb, extending free hand toward Ito: "Harvest!"

Invisible bindings froze Ito completely. Suction emanated from Guan Yu's palm, draining spiritual energy from Ito's dantian.

"Would he... cripple my cultivation?!" Horror gripped Ito. Millennia of mundane cultivation couldn't replicate his divine trial gains. Losing this would reduce him to mortal.

"No!!" Ito's mental scream died unvoiced. Before millions, he'd gladly kneel, yet paralysis held him captive as energy geysered into Guan Yu's grasp.

Below, the Divine Emperor misinterpreted stalemate: "Even if not defeating Guan Yu, parity gives negotiation leverage."

As Guan Yu's left hand accumulated crimson sphere matching his right's azure, he hovered divinity-like.

Energy-depleted, Ito surrendered to despair, bitterness absent: "So ends inferior skill."

Only Guan Yu's bindings prevented plummeting death.

Smiling, Guan Yu clapped spheres together. Cataclysmic merger birthed blinding white energies - gargantuan firework illuminating firmament.

Chapter 1742: Submission

From the luminous eruption, two thicker tendrils entered Ito and Sakurako.

Ito's drained dantian refilled with calmer, mightier energy - no longer requiring frigid Mount Fuji to suppress fiery madness. He now brushed against Realm Sovereign threshold, though earthly spiritual paucity hindered breakthrough.

Sakurako's white wisp catalyzed explosive growth. Her martial arts training recognized this as true spiritual energy - single strand elevating her to first-class mutant!

Unbeknownst to her, such empowerment required both recipient's physical resilience and combined might of Guan Yu and Ito's energies. The white essence represented life force born of water-fire fusion. As elemental opposites (fire-water, metal-wood) combine to spawn creation, drifting motes bestowed divine boons.

Citizens inhaling the essence found ailments cured, vitality restored.

"Is this... celestial power?" Hayakawa murmured, witnessing Sakurako fly toward the combatants.

His father sighed: "I dismissed ancient immortal records as fiction. Yet here stand living deities - though the azure warrior surpasses."

Millions knelt, hailing "Divine Ones." Guan Yu chuckled at approaching Ito: "Your emperor claims divine descent. Now we're called gods - becoming his ancestors?"

Ito knew the imperial divinity myth was political theater. "He'd gladly claim you as progenitor. But having purged my inner flame toxins through your mercy, I glimpse Realm Sovereign ascension. Before, I aspired to rival you. Now I see firefly daring challenge sun and moon. Henceforth, Ito serves as your humble soldier."

Though maintaining public decorum as Eastern Isles' War God, Ito's sincerity shone through.

Guan Yu laughed: "We're brothers confronting extradimensional threats. Your flames melted Mount Fuji's snows - I'll restore her beauty."

Ito's fire attunement precluded snowfall. Nodding, he withdrew. Sakurako buzzed excitedly: "Let me make snow too! I'll be Snow White!"

Though combat concluded, crowds lingered below, speculating about celestial discourse.

Suddenly, cries erupted: "Look! Snow!"

"Sumerian night snow? After that inferno? The peak's melted!"

Yet telescopic observers confirmed: "Snow falls! To Mount Fuji! Divine miracle!"

Mass exodus began as citizens raced vehicles toward the sacred mountain.
