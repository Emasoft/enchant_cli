After Guanyu and Xue Jing emerged, Guanyu first contacted Shensheng and his group, inviting them down the mountain to discuss certain matters. They might need to act as Guanyu's bodyguards until the conclusion of the Yang Family Auction.

Upon receiving this request, Shensheng and his companions immediately agreed. However, only three descended the mountain—Shensheng, Xiaobai, and Bearded Man—leaving one behind to guard the temple.

With these three assisting him, venturing outside should no longer pose a problem for Guanyu. Even if the opposing side refrained from making a move, Guanyu had resolved to confront Bill Lin relentlessly.

Bill Lin's subordinates had injured Shuangshuang, crossing Guanyu's bottom line. This man could not be allowed to remain. Even if he were the young master of a superpower family, so what? He must be eliminated.

As Guanyu prepared to return to Qiaoyuan District, Yang Conghan called: "Guanyu, the treasure map's test results are out."

"What do they say?" Guanyu asked immediately.

"Preliminary analysis suggests it's fake. This pigskin underwent processing and dyeing. Detailed results will require another day," Yang Conghan reported.

"Understood."

After hanging up, Guanyu told Xue Jing: "Initial tests indicate the treasure map is likely counterfeit."

"What now? Will the Yangs still auction it?" Xue Jing inquired.

**Chapter 2628: Reckless Roaming**

"Of course. Even if auctioned, this map won't bear the Yang Family's reputation—they're merely hosting the consignment. Should buyers discover it's fake afterward, the Yangs bear no responsibility. The aggrieved would pursue the original owner," Guanyu explained.

He continued: "But we can't definitively declare the map fake yet. This is only preliminary. We must await detailed results. Moreover, if this concerns the Zhang Family's decade-old treasure hoard, the timeframe isn't extensive. A fifteen-year-old map barely qualifies as antique, making authentication difficult. When the Zhangs were exterminated years ago, legendary wealth vanished. Now a map surfaces—I suspect manipulation behind the scenes."

Xue Jing mused: "Given the old treasure legends, renewed interest isn't surprising. The map's authenticity remains uncertain. Perhaps its propagators want others to hunt the treasure for them."

Guanyu nodded. "All possibilities exist. The situation may be more complex than imagined."

The treasure map concerned Guanyu less than dealing with Bill Lin. His priority remained neutralizing the Feng Family.

**Chapter 2629: Suggestions**

Upon returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guanyu issued strict orders: no residents could leave for any reason without his explicit permission. The women present, including Lan Yu, nodded obediently at his stern demeanor.

Guanyu warned Lan Yu: "Stay here these days—no returning home or wandering about."

"I'll remain without straying," Lan Yu promised.

Guanyu contemplated visiting Jinhua but abandoned the idea—ditching Xue Jing would provoke her fury. Yet bringing Xue Jing along was impossible. He needed perfect strategy.

As Guanyu ate an apple on the sofa, Yingzi approached softly: "Am I disturbing you?"

At his headshake, she sat beside him. "Trouble brewing? I could assist—idling here achieves nothing."

"Too dangerous. How would I face your brother if harm befell you?" Guanyu refused bluntly.

"Doubting my capabilities?" Yingzi straightened proudly. "My cultivation progresses well. I could aid you substantially."

Guanyu recognized her improved skills—likely solid Second-Class Master now. Inspiration struck: summoning Second-to-Wolf as escort might satisfy Xue Jing.

"Help me with something," Guanyu instructed.

Yingzi brightened. "What?"

"Fetch your brother urgently—say I need him for critical business." Guanyu knew Second-to-Wolf responded fastest to Yingzi's summons.

"Just this?" Yingzi pouted but complied. "Should he come directly?"

"Exactly. Don't mention me—claim you need him. He'll hasten here."

Yingzi chuckled understandingly, handing Guanyu a peeled apple. Xue Jing descended freshly bathed: "Any outings planned?"

"None. Rest—you've earned it."

As Xue Jing retired upstairs to cultivate, Guanyu knew his plan half-succeeded. Within an hour, the doorbell rang—Second-to-Wolf's face filled the monitor.

"Damn, he's speedy." Guanyu called: "Yingzi! Your brother's here!"

The siblings reunited warmly at the gate. Guanyu grinned: "Yingzi's name works wonders—you practically flew here."

"You exploited her again?" Second-to-Wolf glared. "Rushing like this could kill someone!"

Guanyu feigned innocence: "She genuinely missed you—ask her!"

Yingzi supported loyally: "I did long to see you, brother."

Second-to-Wolf beamed. "At least Yingzi cares! Unlike some exploiters offering no benefits..." He shot Guanyu a look.

Ignoring this, Guanyu ushered them inside. Second-to-Wolf marveled at the estate: "Should convert these gardens into sports facilities—golf course, perhaps?"

Guanyu dismissed: "I prefer greenery. My estate, my rules."

As they bickered, Yingzi mediated: "Brother, humor him—my welfare depends on it."

Guanyu interjected: "Your brother begrudges my happiness."

"Never!" Second-to-Wolf protested. "But cross Yingzi, and you'll answer to me!"

Yingzi assured: "Guanyu treats me well."

**Chapter 2630: Squabbles**

Second-to-Wolf boasted: "Tracking your target ten days—nothing! Ghosts hide better."

Guanyu countered: "You lost the mark ogling female staff! Admit it!"

Yingzi gasped. "Brother! True?"

Second-to-Wolf flushed. "Nonsense! I'm no lecher!"

Yingzi's skeptical silence damned him further. As Second-to-Wolf spluttered, Guanyu feigned deafness until forced to acknowledge Yingzi's earlier praise.

"Fine, I heard! Now inside before you break your neck!" Guanyu snapped as Second-to-Wolf tripped theatrically.

Yingzi helped her mortified brother up, sighing at their endless rivalry. The trio proceeded indoors, the estate's labyrinthine paths testifying to Guanyu's wealth and Second-to-Wolf's simmering envy.
