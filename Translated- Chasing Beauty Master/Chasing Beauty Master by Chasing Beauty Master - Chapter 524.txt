The words once again reminded Allen that Shituo was right—Locke and his followers were not to be underestimated. Locke himself was a prodigy who had reached the rank of Archmage at a young age, and he had numerous allies. At least three of the Five Elders sided with him.

In contrast, though Allen was a genuine Grand Magus, he could barely handle three Archmages. Pondering this, Allen glanced at the unconscious Guanyu and said, “Our best course now is to wait for Young Brother Guanyu to awaken. We’ll make decisions together once he recovers.”

“Very well. Let’s return and discuss matters further,” someone agreed.

The trio then carried Guanyu out of the Isle of Life. Before departing, Allen assigned two trusted subordinates to guard the island and report any disturbances immediately. This precaution aimed to thwart Locke’s potential sabotage, lest their day’s efforts go to waste.

As they approached the resting quarters, they encountered Locke striding toward them.

“Greetings, Chieftain. Lady Amy,” Locke offered with perfunctory courtesy.

Allen reciprocated, but Amy feigned deafness, refusing even a glance. Locke seemed unperturbed, long accustomed to her coldness. Noticing Shituo beside Allen, he feigned surprise. “Ah! Uncle Shituo! What brings you here?”

Having learned of Locke’s treachery from Guanyu, Shituo masked his disgust. “Why? Are we unwelcome?”

Locke chuckled. “How could I spurn a fatherly figure? As your ‘son,’ how could I not welcome you?”

Shituo inwardly marveled at Locke’s transformation—once honest, now a silver-tongued schemer who trampled others for his goals. By invoking familial bonds, Locke made it awkward for Shituo to oppose him openly.

Yet Shituo, a seasoned veteran, saw through the ploy. After a pause, he boomed with laughter. “You’ve a sharp tongue, boy! If you missed me so, why no visits all these years?”

“Alas, I never knew your whereabouts,” Locke protested.

“Then I’ll pardon you. We’ve pressing matters now. Let’s talk tomorrow.” Shituo gestured for the group to leave. Locke acquiesced, eyeing Guanyu’s limp form before departing.

“How could the slayer of Wei Buqun collapse? Unless…” A realization struck Locke. He sprinted to the Isle of Life under gathering dusk.

**Chapter 1326: The Plan**

Though twilight veiled the island, Locke discerned changes in the World Tree’s foliage. “Impressive… Restoring these leaves must’ve drained them. Let’s raise the stakes.”

Leaping onto the isle, he was halted by two guards. “Halt, Commander Locke!”

“You dare block me?” Locke’s voice turned icy.

“By Chieftain Allen’s orders—none may approach without permission.”

Locke’s brow furrowed. *So the old fox anticipates me. Delaying further will only weaken my position. If he forces my hand…*

“Very well. Stand vigilant,” he growled, retreating. Killing the guards would rouse suspicion—patience was needed.

Once he left, one guard whispered, “Why lie? Allen never gave such orders.”

“Hush! Locke’s malice runs deep. As the Chieftain’s men, we must aid him however we can.”

“True. When the tribe learns the World Tree is healed tomorrow, joy will—”

Meanwhile, Guanyu stirred after hours of unconsciousness. Amy clutched his hand, worry etched on her face.

“My head…” He groaned upright.

“Father! Uncle Shituo! He’s awake!” Amy cried.

Roused from sleep, Allen and Shituo hurried over. “You’ve slept four hours—it’s nearly midnight!” Allen exclaimed.

“Four hours? That long?”

Shituo snorted. “Most would sleep days after such energy depletion. Your constitution’s freakish.”

Guanyu grinned weakly. “The World Tree—how fares it?”

Allen sighed. “An outsider exhausts himself for us, while my own kin plot harm… Ah, the shame.”

Amy pouted. “Don’t call him ‘outsider’! He’s family now!”

Her antics lightened the mood. Guanyu grew serious. “Did you post guards at the isle?”

“Loyalists watch it. Locke can’t interfere,” Allen assured.

“Good. By tomorrow’s deadline, he’ll have no pretext,” Shituo said. “But surface compliance won’t end this. We must crush them utterly.”

Allen hesitated. “Rash action risks civil war. As chieftain, I must protect our future.”

“Mercy to foes is cruelty to oneself!” Shituo argued. “Locke knows no gratitude.”

When asked his view, Guanyu nodded. “Prepare thoroughly. Strike only if provoked—but decisively.”

“So be it. Rest now. Dawn brings challenges,” Allen conceded.

As others left, Amy lingered. “You… you’ll protect Father, won’t you? I’ve already lost Mother…”

Guanyu patted her head. “I promise. Once this ends, I’ll show you the world beyond these woods.”

**Chapter 1327: Valley of Perdition**

Alone again, Guanyu checked his recovered energy. A voice echoed—his bonded spirit, Jingang.

“You risked much today, Patriarch.”

“Your aid was crucial. But Shituo senses your presence.”

“Does it matter? He’s no enemy.” Suddenly, Jingang materialized as a spectral figure. “I need a physical vessel—preferably a high-tier beast’s body.”

Guanyu arched a brow. “A magical beast? Planning dual cultivation?”

Jingang grinned. “Your magic-body refinement synergy inspires me. A compact Earth-rank beast would suffice.”

“Earth-rank? Those rival Archmages! Finding one’s hard enough—capturing it, harder!”

“Patriarch…” Jingang wheedled. “My first request in ages…”

Grumbling, Guanyu relented. “Fine! But if we’re caught by Locke’s spies…”

Under night’s cloak, they slipped into the darkened forest. A guard questioned them at the gates.

“Late errand,” Guanyu replied. “Grant us passage.”

The path ahead promised peril—but for loyal companions, no challenge was insurmountable.
