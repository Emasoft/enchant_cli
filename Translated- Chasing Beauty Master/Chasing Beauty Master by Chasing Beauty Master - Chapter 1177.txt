After enduring relentless torment and abuse from his wife, Lin Zhonggeng had nearly reached the brink of suicide. Fortunately, Lin Qiaoqiao returned home just in time. Since then, the elderly couple had become utterly compliant towards their granddaughter, not daring to voice the slightest complaint.

This martial arts competition to choose a husband had been held with Lin Qiaoqiao's consent. Yet the plan had backfired spectacularly. Originally, she had intended to borrow Guan Yu's prowess to defeat all challengers, thereby forcing him into marriage. But fate proved fickle—who could have foreseen Guan Yu losing his cultivation? Though deeply concerned, Lin Qiaoqiao maintained unwavering faith in him.

Hearing Li Gui's words, Guan Yu felt compelled to deflate the man's arrogance. "Oh?" he sneered with mock surprise. "So Young Master Li also grew up in City A?"

Li Gui clasped hands behind his back, chin lifted imperiously. "What does your petty municipal divisions matter? They hold no bearing on my sincere devotion to Qiaoqiao!"

The father-son duo seemed determined to outdo each other in proclaiming their affection. Guan Yu pressed further: "Qiaoqiao distinctly told me she was raised in City A. Since Young Master claims never to have visited, how exactly does this 'childhood friendship' of yours hold water?" He emphasized the words "childhood" pointedly.

In truth, the Li and Lin families had indeed been close during the girl's youth. The elderly Lins frequently brought their granddaughter back to their hometown for extended stays, during which the Lis became regular visitors. Thus Li Gui and Lin Qiaoqiao had played together often until adulthood's responsibilities reduced their visits. Now they only returned during holidays to visit grandparents.

"You wouldn't understand—nor need you," Li Gui retorted haughtily. His father watched with paternal pride, mistaking arrogance for capability. To Guan Yu, however, the man resembled a starving turtle—his smug, red-nosed face begging to be ground into the dirt.

"Spare me the details," Guan Yu dismissed. Turning to Lin Qiaoqiao, he suggested, "Didn't you bring gifts for everyone? Let's distribute them."

Chapter 3016: Gift-Giving

Though unable to gauge Li Gui's cultivation level since losing his own abilities, Guan Yu noted the children's excitement as Lin Qiaoqiao unpacked numerous bags. She distributed trinkets to youngsters and presents to relatives, earning effusive praise about her filial piety and marriageable virtues.

Notably absent was Li Gui's gift. The man's thick-skinned inquiry came as no surprise: "Qiaoqiao, where's my present?"

"I distinctly remember buying you a watch!" she exclaimed, checking bags in confusion. Unbeknownst to all, Guan Yu had earlier tossed the timepiece into an ornamental pond.

"Probably lost," he shrugged. "Hardly worth retrieving."

"Nonsense!" Li Gui protested. "This was Qiaoqiao's gift—it must be found!" Guan Yu concealed his satisfaction at the man's agitation, having deliberately disposed of the 2000-yuan watch he'd helped select. What galled him was discovering that Lin Qiaoqiao's "good friend" turned out to be this insufferable braggart.

Chapter 3017: Missing Timepiece

As search efforts proved futile, Li Gui's accusations flew: "You! You pauper stole it! Hand it over!" His shout drew everyone's attention. Guan Yu remained calm, anticipating this confrontation.

Lin Qiaoqiao immediately defended him: "How dare you! Guan Yu would never—"

"Face facts!" Li Gui countered. "The bag never left his hands. If not shoplifting, where else?" Some onlookers nodded, their bias showing against the outsider.

Three defenders stood firm—the Lin grandparents and Qiaoqiao herself. They knew Guan Yu resided in the city's wealthiest district, making petty theft implausible. Guan Yu waited, biding his time.

"You're blinded by his façade!" Li Gui spat. "That watch was my proof of your regard!"

"I'll replace it tomorrow," Lin Qiaoqiao offered coldly. "But slandering my friend is unacceptable."

Undeterred, Li Gui advanced: "Let me search him! The thief's hiding it!" His true aim became clear—plant evidence and humiliate Guan Yu publicly.

"Enough!" Lin Qiaoqiao blocked his path. Guan Yu gently touched her shoulder, stepping forward.

"Real men don't hide behind women," Li Gui taunted. "Submit to a search!"

The crowd held its breath as Guan Yu's lips curved. Years of facing far more formidable opponents made this posturing laughable. Yet the game required proper staging.

"By all means," he said, spreading his arms. "But what will you do when you find nothing?"

Li Gui's confidence wavered momentarily before he began patting down Guan Yu's jacket. Midway through, Guan Yu's hand shot out, catching Li Gui's wrist with vise-like grip.

"Careful," he murmured. "False accusations carry consequences."

The warning hung in the air as the spectators realized—this was no ordinary man to be trifled with.
