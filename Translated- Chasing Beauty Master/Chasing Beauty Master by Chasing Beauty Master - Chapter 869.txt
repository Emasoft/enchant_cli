Guan Yu’s gaze remained fixed on Shuangshuang without wavering for a moment, and her words left everyone in the room utterly speechless. He had not expected a seventeen-year-old girl to speak with such maturity. For someone so young to already be considering her mother’s long-term well-being with such foresight and thoroughness was truly remarkable.

Shuangshuang’s mother continued to stroke her daughter’s beautiful hair, her heart swelling with emotion. She had never imagined her youngest child could articulate such thoughts. “Shuangshuang, you’ve grown up… and I’ve grown old,” she murmured.

At this, Auntie’s tears began to flow freely once more. Her years of doting on her youngest daughter had not been in vain—the girl’s maturity far exceeded her expectations.

The atmosphere in the room was heavy with the emotions shared between the Qu family mother and daughter—all except for one person: the village chief’s daughter. Silently, she cursed Qu Shuangshuang for her shamelessness. *He’s the man I chose first! How dare you try to steal him?* Yet she felt no real anxiety. She knew the Qu family would never allow Shuangshuang to abandon her studies so early.

**Chapter 2224: I Know the Way Well**

The entire room was swept up in the emotional exchange between the Qu family mother and daughter—all except the village chief’s daughter, who seethed inwardly. *That Qu Shuangshuang has no shame! I saw him first—how dare she try to take him?* Still, she remained unperturbed, confident the Qu family would never let Shuangshuang drop out of school prematurely.

Whether from the countryside or the city, every Chinese person held one belief firm: education and personal achievements were the only paths to future success and wealth. In their eyes, without knowledge, one would amount to nothing in society—a worthless burden.

As tensions began to rise again, Guan Yu deftly shifted the conversation. “Auntie,” he said, “you need to sit or lie down on the kang with your legs stretched out. That’s the best position for your recovery. Since you’ve agreed to let me treat you, you must follow my instructions from now on.”

“Of course, of course,” Auntie replied, allowing her two daughters to help her onto the kang, where she settled with her legs extended. Guan Yu added, “Today is the first treatment, and you’ll need medicine tonight. I’ll have to go into town to purchase it. Would someone familiar with the roads accompany me?”

“I’ll go! I know the way perfectly!” The village chief’s daughter seized the opportunity immediately. This was her chance to claim Guan Yu for herself.

“Handsome Brother, I’m familiar too—I attend school in town!” Shuangshuang chimed in.

“I’ll go! Me too!”

The girls clamored eagerly, all vying for a ride in the luxury car outside. To them, even one trip in a vehicle worth millions would be a lifetime’s worth of bragging rights.

“Let’s go, then,” Guan Yu said, leading the way to the Bentley Continental parked outside. Though typically a two-seater, Yang Conghan’s limited edition model featured a custom-added back row.

After folding down the front passenger seat to allow access to the rear, Guan Yu opened the car door. Shuangshuang scrambled in first, followed by Ling’er and Qu Meimei. The other girls had initially tried to dissuade Meimei—after all, as tomorrow’s bride, she’d have her chance to ride in style. But Meimei insisted that a car like this could never be ridden too often, and her persistence won out.

Unnoticed by the others, the village chief’s daughter played her hand cleverly. After “generously” letting Shuangshuang, Meimei, and Ling’er into the back, she swiftly claimed the front passenger seat the moment Guan Yu restored it.

With the car now full, the three girls in the snug backseat found it surprisingly comfortable. Ling’er began teaching Shuangshuang how to use her iPhone. Four girls and Guan Yu—the village chief’s daughter, now seated triumphantly up front, felt her first objective had been achieved.

The million-dollar car glided smoothly over the rugged village roads, its premium suspension softening the bumps. For the village chief’s daughter, however, the jostling served a purpose—it was all part of her plan.

As the village’s golden girl, accustomed to deference and pursued by every eligible young man, she had long embraced her sensuality. Since junior high, she’d cycled through relationships, treating intimacy as mutual sport. Now back in the village under her family’s watchful eyes, she still found ways to satisfy her frequent cravings with local admirers—evaluating each encounter against her private metrics of performance.

Today, Guan Yu met every criterion: handsome, tall, undoubtedly virile, and clearly wealthy. She was determined to have him.

As the car navigated the uneven terrain, the village chief’s daughter—dressed in a fashionable oversized green T-shirt with bold buttons—seized her moment. A strategically timed bump loosened her hem, revealing black lace-trimmed stockings. When Guan Yu glanced over, concerned she’d hit her head, he found himself confronted by a daring display of thigh and lingerie.

“Oh!” she feigned distress, “I’m fine—just a sudden stomachache.”

Guan Yu’s next glance revealed even more: her shirt now unbuttoned further, hands artfully lifting the fabric to expose the lacy triangle beneath. “Really, I’m alright,” she insisted, though her fingers had begun exploring beneath the lace.

**Chapter 2225: Unmoved**

Guan Yu’s subsequent look left him stunned. What he’d initially mistaken for stomach-rubbing was now unmistakable—the village chief’s daughter had slipped her hand beneath her lingerie, fingers working deliberately. Leaning closer, she flushed and tightened her thighs, shooting him a provocative glance.

*Is she seriously trying to seduce me with others in the car?* Guan Yu marveled. Though no stranger to bold advances, he found her audacity remarkable. Yet compared to the beauties in his life—including the exquisite Ling’er in the backseat—she paled.

“If the pain’s eased, best stop rubbing,” he advised coolly, refocusing on the road.

The village chief’s daughter froze. Never had a man resisted her so thoroughly. *He’s playing hard to get,* she decided. *No man refuses fresh prey.*

Her escalating motions finally drew the backseat’s attention. Ling’er, blushing, averted her eyes. Shuangshuang, ever mischievous, leaned forward. “Sister Yao, does your stomach still hurt? Let me check!”

The village chief’s daughter jerked her hand free, hastily adjusting her clothes. “I’m fine!” she snapped, inwardly cursing Shuangshuang’s interference.

Guan Yu suppressed a smirk. “I know excellent stomach remedies,” he remarked pointedly, “ones that cure… self-induced ailments.”

The jab stung, but the village chief’s daughter only grew more determined. *Just wait,* she seethed.

**Chapter 2226: Heaven’s Design**

As the car finally hit smoother roads, Meimei turned to Ling’er. “Thank you for bringing such an amazing brother and this beautiful car.”

“No need for thanks between sisters,” Ling’er demurred.

“You should thank me too!” Shuangshuang interjected playfully.

The village chief’s daughter seethed in silence, her plans momentarily thwarted but far from abandoned. Ahead lay miles of road—and in her mind, endless opportunities to claim what she desired.
