“On the chessboard, Guan Yu had slaughtered him mercilessly—what a miserable defeat! If they didn’t find some amusement for Guan Yu, it would utterly betray the ruthless reputation he’d painstakingly built in their circle.

But who was Guan Yu? How could he not see through Cui Jian’s petty schemes? How could he be provoked so easily?

‘Heh, Brother Cui,’ Guan Yu said with a cheeky grin, ‘you’re not wrong, but it depends on the person, doesn’t it? I think Brother Jun and I can become good friends without such methods.’

Guan Yu laughed, but Cui Jian’s smile vanished.

‘Fighting breeds familiarity only with certain people?’ Guan Yu’s meaning was clear: some deserved a beating before becoming ‘acquainted.’ In other words, Cui Jian needed discipline—harsh lessons were unavoidable.

Cui Jian’s weathered face darkened completely.

Chen Yu naturally grasped Guan Yu’s implication but felt no anger. After enduring Cui Jian’s traps for so long, seeing the schemer hoist by his own petard was deeply satisfying. How could he miss this chance to mock?

He burst into laughter. ‘Oh, Lao Jian! Even you have today!’

Cui Jian, nicknamed ‘Lao Jian’ (Old Cheap) for his infuriating nature, now faced the collective scorn of the room. The crowd roared until their sides ached, leaving Xiao Xiong to finally step forward.

These brothers had been tense for days. Xiao Xiong allowed them this rare moment of levity before raising a hand. ‘Enough laughter. Everyone out—I need to speak with Guan Yu.’

All exited chuckling except the grim-faced Cui Jian, with Chen Yu continuing his taunts: ‘The peasants have risen!’

When only Guan Yu and Xiao Xiong remained in the vast room, their expressions sobered.

‘Brother Xiao,’ Guan Yu said earnestly, ‘I know you went to great lengths to pass Mo Kai to me. If I hesitated now, I’d be unworthy. I came to L City to help you through this crisis. Now my burden grows heavier, but I swear: as long as I draw breath, Mo Kai won’t fall.’

Xiao Xiong smiled approvingly, clapping Guan Yu’s shoulder. ‘Just as I trusted you’d come, I trust you’ll pull Mo Kai from this abyss. And I believe your capabilities far exceed what we’ve seen—yes?’

Guan Yu scratched his head sheepishly, confirming Xiao Xiong’s suspicions. Connections like Patriarch Zhao in the capital and his own psychic abilities—unknown to Xiao Xiong—were his trump cards. Hidden assets too: saving a Zhongnanhai heavyweight surnamed Wen, rescuing a tycoon’s heir, favors owed by figures like Li Yuanshan. These lifelines were one-time uses, reserved for direst need.

‘I eagerly await the miracles you’ll work,’ Xiao Xiong chuckled.

‘Brother Xiao,’ Guan Yu shifted tone, ‘explain L City’s situation.’

Xiao Xiong’s smile faded. ‘You know Cheng Gui’s background. Though vicious, he never threatened me before. Now he attacks fiercely, his power multiplying overnight—unnatural. I suspect formidable backers. Otherwise, he’d never dare provoke me.’

Arrogance underpinned by strength.

‘Surface-level, it’s our feud. But higher powers are entangled.’

‘Higher?’ Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed.

Xiao Xiong nodded. ‘The struggle between power and profit—a balance maintained until Cheng Gui shattered it. Now the scales tip, and those above must act.’

Guan Yu frowned. Complexity deepened.

Both Han Hai and Mo Kai were L City’s corporate titans, their annual contributions unmatched. As twin tigers clashing, bureaucrats’ records hung in the balance—defenders of status quo and ambitious climbers alike stirred the pot. Their meddling intensified the conflict, for the victor would reap unimaginable rewards.

**Chapter 624: Capture the Leader First**

Xiao Xiong reigned unchallenged as the underworld sovereign. Even during his half-year incarceration, Mo Kai’s dominance held. But prolonged monopoly bred envy. Previously timid, Cheng Gui now attacked like a rabid dog—Xiao Xiong smelled conspiracy.

Yet Guan Yu’s thoughts raced faster. Through Xiao Xiong’s analysis, he increasingly linked events to Wan Qianshan.

After long silence, Guan Yu spoke. ‘Brother Xiao, I might know something about this hidden scheme.’

‘You?’ Xiao Xiong’s gaze turned razor-edged.

‘In N City,’ Guan Yu explained, ‘I crossed paths with Wan Qianshan—Taiwan’s underworld patriarch. His assassination attempts failed, but I uncovered secrets. He planted three formidable agents in N City, orchestrating a plot. My theory? They aim to lure me here to kill.’

Friends trust friends; enemies distrust all.

‘You threaten them?’ Xiao Xiong growled.

‘Presumably. Why else persist?’ Guan Yu shrugged.

‘After repeated failures, they realized killing you in N City grew impossible. Hence, luring you here where they’ll strike freely.’

Guan Yu nodded.

‘So I’m bait to hook you. Cheng Gui’s backer is Wan Qianshan.’

‘Exactly.’ Speaking with the clever spared effort.

Xiao Xiong’s brow furrowed as he processed this. Guan Yu’s leaps connected disparate threads—outlandish, yet explaining Cheng Gui’s sudden might.

But purpose? Merely killing Guan Yu couldn’t justify upending L City’s order. Greater schemes brewed.

‘Know their plan?’ Xiao Xiong pressed.

Guan Yu smiled wryly. ‘No. That’s another reason I came.’

‘If true, this surpasses my worst estimates.’ Xiao Xiong grimaced. ‘I’ve heard of Wan Qianshan—a true overlord who bent Taiwan’s underworld to his knee.’

‘Your words clarify something,’ Xiao Xiong added. ‘Yesterday’s clash revealed Cheng Gui’s new arsenal—advanced weaponry likely from Wan Qianshan. Without those arms, we wouldn’t have been overwhelmed.’

‘Rogue states smuggle arms to Taiwan,’ Guan Yu mused. ‘With Wan’s influence, acquiring such hardware is trivial. This confirms suspicions. Similar stockpiles probably exist in N City.’

‘Wan’s ambition is vast,’ Xiao Xiong remarked.

Guan Yu’s eyes glinted. ‘Indeed. Greed risks choking him.’

‘You alone could choke him,’ Xiao Xiong said meaningfully.

‘This web exceeds our imaginings. Your plan?’ Having passed Mo Kai’s reins, Xiao Xiong would follow Guan Yu’s lead—though he’d never be a hands-off manager. Mo Kai was his child, still needing nurture.

‘Capture the leader first,’ Guan Yu declared.

‘I tried,’ Xiao Xiong sighed. ‘Cheng Gui’s new guards are elite. Teams I sent never returned.’

‘Not through force,’ Guan Yu shook his head. ‘Open warfare, though effective, invites official backlash. Pressure or sabotage could cripple us mid-struggle.’

‘My plan: turn Cheng Gui’s backers to our side. Without support, he’ll hesitate before fighting.’

Xiao Xiong stared, then laughed. ‘That’s not “capturing the leader”!’

‘A metaphor!’ Guan Yu grinned. ‘Had I excelled in literature, I wouldn’t have settled for art school. Seemed fitting enough.’

‘If those above heard your metaphor, they’d never side with you,’ Xiao Xiong teased, noting Guan Yu’s defensive pout.

On reflection, Guan Yu flushed. A cultured rogue was truly fearsome—his own education needed urgent upgrading.

‘But consider,’ Xiao Xiong sobered, ‘Han Hai’s advantage grows daily. Many bet on them. With Mo Kai’s current state, how attract allies?’

‘Where there’s will,’ Guan Yu stretched lazily, ‘there’s a way.’

:)

**Chapter 625: Tea**

‘This place?’ Guan Yu eyed the antiquated teahouse, turning to Xiao Xiong.

Nodding, Xiao Xiong glimpsed approaching figures and tensed.

Following his gaze, Guan Yu murmured, ‘Cheng Gui?’

‘Yes.’ Xiao Xiong’s voice chilled—their enmity ran deep.

‘Director Jia’s tea might prove bitter,’ Guan Yu remarked meaningfully.

Director Jia Ren—an oddly named but influential police chief—had summoned them to Suya Teahouse after yesterday’s gang wars. That Cheng Gui also arrived spoke volumes.

‘Let’s go.’ Xiao Xiong strode forward, deeming Cheng Gui beneath notice—a mad dog unworthy of attention.

But mad dogs bite.

‘Well, if it isn’t Brother Xiao!’ Cheng Gui sneered. ‘Mo Kai crumbles, yet you sip tea? Admirable composure!’

Xiao Xiong glanced past him, entering wordlessly. Guan Yu followed after a lingering look.

The dismissal stung Cheng Gui’s pride. ‘Bastard! Soon you’ll kneel licking my shoes!’ He stormed inside with five henchmen.

Suya Teahouse, nestled by West Lake, was famed for serenity—a luxury where white-collar workers escaped life’s grind. But no scenery could soothe Jia Ren’s turmoil.

Slumped in his chair, the police director ignored the snow-dusted lake view. Cheng Gui’s sudden assault on Xiao Xiong—both corporate and underworld—had spiraled beyond control. Gang wars bloodied streets, citizens complained, superiors demanded results.

Two minor gangs he could handle. But these were L City’s titans, their companies economic pillars. Arrests risked chaos; inaction meant carnage. Hence, this forced parley.
