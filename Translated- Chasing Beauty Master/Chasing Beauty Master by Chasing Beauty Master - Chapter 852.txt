“I need to go out for a drink and don’t want to drive. Arrange a car,” Feng Xihu (West Lake Feng) instructed.

The bodyguards hurried to the garage. Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu seamlessly blended into their ranks without raising suspicion. After deliberately scanning the guards, Feng Xihu pointed at Guan Yu. “You’ll accompany me. Drive.”

“Yes, Young Mistress.” Guan Yu bowed before settling into the driver’s seat. They departed the Feng estate unimpeded.

Once outside, Guan Yu glanced through the rearview mirror at Feng Xihu’s delicate features. “Where shall we go, Young Mistress?” Though initially sullen, Feng Xihu couldn’t suppress a laugh at his playful tone.

Her laughter surprised even herself—it had been ages since she’d felt such lightness. Guan Yu’s presence always kindled her joy, a stark contrast to recent burdens.

“Thank you,” Guan Yu said earnestly.

“No need. I’m merely acting on my wishes,” Feng Xihu replied calmly, believing she owed him for inadvertently trapping him earlier.

“Pull over here,” she instructed moments later.

Guan Yu parked but lingered, turning to face her. “If I someday kill Feng Shaoye (Young Master Feng), would you resent me?”

Feng Xihu’s expression tightened. After a pause, she murmured, “I won’t involve myself further in your feud. I plan to leave.”

This was her only escape—to avoid witnessing loved ones destroy each other.

“A wise choice. Enjoy your travels.” With that, Guan Yu exited the car.

When Feng Shaoye awoke to reports of his sister’s outing, suspicion never touched him—until Bierlin summoned him to surveillance footage.

“Rest well?” Feng Shaoye greeted cordially.

Bierlin shook his head, rewinding footage of the West Building’s entrance. Four guards had left…but returned with five. Freezing the frame, he pointed. “This man is Guan Yu.”

“What?!” Feng Shaoye roared, leaping up before wincing at his injured leg. “How can you be certain?”

“Four guards departed. This fifth emerged from the West Building—a rat in our walls.” The replay confirmed it: Guan Yu had hidden in Feng Xihu’s quarters, escaping under her protection.

Enraged yet powerless against his sister, Feng Shaoye vented on the oblivious guards. “Blind fools! How’d you miss an extra man?!” After brutalizing them, he expelled the group from the estate.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu found his womenfolk worried but tactful. Xue Jing mentioned a visitor: “A woman came—Lei Jie’s friend, I believe.”

Ganbili—his covert savior—had likely checked on him. His lost communicator (left in Feng’s vault) and dead phone explained the missed contact.

As Zhang Han bounded over, her “bunny hops” drawing eyes to her assets, she sniffed theatrically. “Big Brother Guan Yu! You smell like that woman’s perfume!”

“Enough. Go game,” Guan Yu deflected, relieved when Xue Jing intervened with promises of in-game monster spawns.

Yang Conghan observed silently. Though curious about his ordeal, she respected his privacy—a man would share when ready.

Post-meal, Guan Yu bathed and prepared to rest until Jinhua summoned him. After enduring farewell kisses, he drove to Pan Taisheng’s apartment.

Jinhua’s question cut deep: “I heard Miss Yang moved to Qiaoyuan?” Her tone carried unspoken hurt—she remained his “outside woman,” denied public acknowledgment.

Guilt gnawed as Guan Yu bit into her offered apple. She voiced her fears: “I can’t live in shadows forever…but if my clan’s avengers emerge…”

He embraced her. “My women won’t hide.” Yet both knew reality: until the Yang and Feng families fell, sunlight meant death for Jinhua.

Their conversation turned to Feng’s relocated Ten Thousand Year Demon Domain. “How did they anticipate you?” Jinhua wondered. Unspoken hung Yang Conghan’s role—the Yangs had leaked Guan Yu’s intent.

Meanwhile at the Feng estate, Bierlin’s lust overrode reason. Watching Feng Xihu’s drunken return, he plotted: “Who’d believe her if I took her tonight?”

After meticulous grooming, he slipped into the West Building at dusk, heart pounding. To Bierlin, consequences meant nothing—the Bier family’s wealth smoothed all sins.
