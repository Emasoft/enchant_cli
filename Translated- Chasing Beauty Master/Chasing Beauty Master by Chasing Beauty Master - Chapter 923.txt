“Yes, I just came from her place. What a coincidence running into you while deciding whether to save her or not?” Guanyu pointed at the man beside Pan Xiaoxia and asked, “And this gentleman is...?”

The intimacy between them seemed unusual, Guanyu thought. As expected, after his inquiry, Pan Xiaoxia chuckled and said, “This is my boyfriend, Zhao Yihe.”

Zhao Yihe appeared rather upright. After Pan Xiaoxia’s introduction, he stepped forward first and extended his hand. “Pleasure to meet you.”

“Likewise.” Guanyu shook hands amiably. At first glance, Pan Xiaoxia’s boyfriend seemed decent—likely the scion of a wealthy family, given the luxury sports car parked behind them. Guanyu glanced at it and recognized a sleek gray Aston Martin.

“Ordinary families can’t afford such prestigious cars,” Guanyu remarked with a smile. “Congratulations, Teacher Pan. I’m eagerly awaiting your wedding banquet!”

“Hear, hear! I’m impatient to toast my little sister’s marriage too,” Pan Taisheng interjected, clapping Guanyu’s shoulder as he approached. “If you don’t marry soon, you’ll be labeled a leftover woman! By the way, I heard your sister brought her mother along. If the room’s too cramped, I can arrange a larger one.”

“No need for trouble. They’re perfectly content and asked me to thank you,” Guanyu replied cheerfully.

Pan Taisheng gave Guanyu’s shoulder a hearty thump—a gesture of camaraderie despite the sting. “You rascal! Why the formality? I told you ages ago to claim my sister for yourself. Now she’s taken—regretting it, eh?” he joked boisterously.

True to his blunt nature, Pan Taisheng’s words, though harmless, made Zhao Yihe flush with discomfort, as if he’d settled for someone’s castoffs.

Noticing Zhao Yihe’s subtle shift in demeanor, Guanyu tactfully remarked, “Our Teacher Pan’s beau is clearly a refined gentleman. Mind your rough edges around him—such cultured company might find your coarseness startling.” Pausing, he turned to Zhao Yihe. “May I ask which prominent family you hail from, Brother Zhao?”

Zhao Yihe straightened, pride evident. “I’m the eldest son of the Zhao family in Lian City. Currently managing a branch of our enterprise. My greatest advantage? Ample leisure time—unlike those shackled by work.”

He seemed eager to elaborate, enthusiastically listing his virtues by the roadside, hoping for further inquiries.

“Ah, a scion of nobility! Your bearing exudes grandeur,” Guanyu remarked politely, though he’d never heard of any Zhao family in Lian City. “Teacher Pan’s fortunate to meet someone of your stature. How long have you been acquainted?”

“Just three days!” Pan Taisheng cut in. “My friend introduced them—she’s a legendary matchmaker who’s paired countless couples across the nation.”

Chapter 2361: A Petty Man Revealed

Guanyu nodded, realizing why Pan Xiaoxia—usually astute and proud—hadn’t seen through Zhao Yihe’s pettiness. Time would expose his narrow-mindedness, he mused. The man’s boastful demeanor alone grated—a true gentleman wouldn’t flaunt status so crudely. Likely, Zhao Yihe pursued Pan Xiaoxia solely for her beauty.

“Impressive connections!” Guanyu chuckled. “Have your matchmaker find me some beauties too.”

Pan Taisheng glanced warily at Xue Jing, who remained unfazed. She knew Guanyu jested—no ordinary woman could rival the extraordinary ladies of Qiaoyuan District.

Noticing Xue Jing’s masked face and alluring figure, Zhao Yihe inquired with false courtesy, “Why the mask in mild weather?”

Xue Jing ignored him, disdainful of those who flaunt family prestige. When Zhao Yihe pressed, Guanyu interjected, “I instructed her not to engage strangers.”

Xue Jing’s melodic laugh only intensified Zhao Yihe’s curiosity. Determined to see her face, he proposed, “Let’s dine together! My treat—to better acquaint ourselves.”

Pan Taisheng eagerly endorsed, but Guanyu declined: “My household awaits. Another time.”

Chapter 2362: Celestial Being

“You slight me!” Zhao Yihe protested, though Guanyu saw through his ulterior motives. As tensions simmered, Pan Taisheng mediated: “Another day then.”

Departing, Guanyu’s customized luxury car caught Zhao Yihe’s expert eye—its engineered balance and enhanced engine spoke of masterful modification.

“What’s his background?” Zhao Yihe probed later.

“Guanyu?” Pan Taisheng mused. “He’s from another realm—a celestial among mortals.”

Driven by bruised ego, Zhao Yihe resolved to humble this so-called immortal. Meanwhile, Guanyu predicted their paths would cross again: “His type never rests until salvaging pride.”

Xue Jing shuddered. “Must we endure him again?”

“His curiosity about you ensures it,” Guanyu replied. As they drove home, the Qiaoyuan women’s recent pastime flashed through his mind—comparing him favorably against all men. Their verdict? No earthly rival could match their celestial guardian.
