Everyone believed the treasure map created by Guan Yu was genuine, since it had been the first revealed publicly—much like how first impressions dominate. After witnessing another supposed treasure map emerge, people instinctively deemed it fake. Through collective speculation, Guan Yu's map was elevated to unprecedented heights, its price skyrocketing endlessly.

Jin Ciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) remarked, "I still think this treasure map's authentic. I even told Guan Yu we should strike Billin first—seize those three maps in his hands before he gathers them all. Once he completes the set, it'll be too late. We must act swiftly. How can you claim it's fake?"

"Has anyone or anything actually proven that map's authenticity?" Qi Zhi countered, perplexed. "When rumors of hidden treasure spread, the maps conveniently surfaced afterward. No one's ever verified their legitimacy. I don't understand why everyone's so eager to believe."

Jin Ciyu Lang responded, "These are legends of ancient treasures buried centuries ago! Who could possibly validate them now? If someone could distinguish real from fake, they'd have to be either original mapmakers—who'd be immortals by now—or treasure hunters needing no maps at all!"

His logic held weight. With the treasure's antiquity, no living authority could authenticate the maps. Until Guan Yu's set was fully assembled, they remained "real" by default. Even if challengers emerged, public faith wouldn't waver.

"Younger Brother Jin speaks truth," someone agreed. "The map's reality lies in collective belief. With fragments now valued at millions, who'd pay such sums for fakes? Billin's no fool. Even if counterfeit, their astronomical worth transforms them into truth."

Guan Yu raised his wineglass, signaling a toast. Few shared Qi Zhi's skepticism anymore—most fixated on soaring prices rather than authenticity.

Qi Zhi pressed, "Your reasoning holds merit, Elder Brother Jin. Yet I've heard the inaugural map fragment originated from Guan Yu himself. Might I inquire about its provenance?"

"Excellent question!" Jin Ciyu Lang interjected. "I've wondered this myself. Guan Yu, enlighten us—how did the first map come into your possession?"

Chapter 2879: Vengeance Approaches

Qi Zhi's inquiry—whether probing or genuine—met Guan Yu's swift reply: "When I first settled here, my family purchased land on Qiaoyuan Street for residency. During foundation excavation, workers uncovered a small box containing the map fragment. Initially clueless about its significance, I stored it away until recent treasure rumors surfaced."

"Suddenly, word spread that I possessed a map fragment. Overnight, I became everyone's target—even sleep grew perilous. When Ying Shan Gu (Camp Mountain Aunt), one of the Jianghu's Ten Evils specializing in poisons, threatened me, I surrendered the fragment. Her acquisition became public knowledge, granting me temporary peace."

Qi Zhi nodded. "A tale worthy of legends. Ying Shan Gu's infamous—venomous in body and spirit, surrounded by toxic vermin. None dare approach her."

"Indeed," Guan Yu sighed. "The Poisonous Widow's tragic past shaped her cruelty—murdering husband and unborn child. Such despair breeds monstrosity."

Jin Ciyu Lang scoffed, "Pity the wretched, but her later atrocities..."

"Elder Brother Jin," Guan Yu interrupted abruptly, "Let's order snacks. A pizza sounds excellent—we're all famished, yes?"

Catching Guan Yu's meaningful glance, Jin Ciyu Lang swallowed his words about eliminating Ying Shan Gu—a secret better kept hidden, especially from Qi Zhi whose trust remained unproven.

When summoned, the server inquired, "How may I assist you, gentlemen?"

After ordering mushroom pizza and chilled fish noodles, conversation resumed cautiously. Qi Zhi noted, "Since obtaining your map, Ying Shan Gu vanished completely. Billin's scouts find no trace."

"Jianghu folk are transient," Guan Yu explained. "That night, twenty armed assailants ambushed her for the map. Though she unleashed venomous spiders from pouches—creatures killing within minutes through hemorrhagic fever—she sustained grave injuries. Likely hiding to recuperate, avoiding becoming target practice."

"Most would sell fragments immediately for profit," Qi Zhi observed. "Hoarding suggests greater ambitions."

"Precisely," Guan Yu agreed. "Unlike short-sighted profiteers, the Poisonous Widow schemes long-term. Her notorious ambition explains the solitude."

As Jin Ciyu Lang grimaced at recollected insect swarms, a melodious voice interrupted: "Guan Yu, it's time."

All turned to see Ling'er descending—a vision of perfection that left Qi Zhi spellbound. Her recent transformation under Pan Taisheng's care radiated youthful elegance.

"Allow introductions," Guan Yu said. "Ling'er, this is Qi Zhi—Hou Jinshun's associate. Qi Zhi, meet my sister Ling'er."

"Greetings, Brother Qi Zhi," Ling'er chimed, her dulcet tone liquefying Qi Zhi's composure. "Are you new here? I don't recall seeing you before."

Chapter 2880: Taking Action

Qi Zhi's breath caught—her address of "Brother" carried disarming sweetness. Guan Yu's emphasis on "Hou Jinshun's associate" subtly marked distance, which Ling'er noted despite Qi Zhi's dazed reception.

As preparations commenced for their departure to Pan Taisheng's estate, Ling'er's presence dominated the scene—a living testament to how serenity and proper care could elevate beauty beyond mortal measures. Her every movement captivated, leaving observers like Qi Zhi momentarily forgetting the deadly intrigues surrounding them, lost in contemplation of perfection's transient nature amidst Jianghu's perpetual storms.
