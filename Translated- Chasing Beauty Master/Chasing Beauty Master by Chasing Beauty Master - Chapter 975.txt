“But the current situation allowed her no time to prepare. Qu Guandao naturally understood this too, which was why he had launched relentless attacks from the start, denying his opponent any breathing room.

Yingshan Gu was forced back again, realizing defeat was inevitable today. Yet she couldn't bear letting Qu Guandao obtain the treasure map. Suddenly, his prayer beads came crashing toward her face.

Gritting her teeth, Yingshan Gu untied a bulging cloth pouch from her back. No one could tell what mysterious contents it held.

In desperation, she aimed the pouch at the incoming prayer beads. The pouch burst open, releasing a swarm of venomous centipedes—varying in size and color, some striped with vivid patterns.

The shattered pouch unleashed this toxic horde. To avoid poisoning, Qu Guandao frantically swung his prayer beads to block the falling centipedes.

His golden prayer beads formed a defensive wall, yet one ten-centimeter-long centipede still landed on him. With a startled cry, he flicked it away, but a burning pain already spread through his left shoulder.

The bitten area turned black, the necrosis rapidly expanding. Meanwhile, the fallen centipedes swarmed toward him with uncanny coordination.

'Poisoned!' Qu Guandao's heart sank. His left arm had gone completely numb. Recognizing the venom's potency, he knew survival required immediate escape to detoxify. Without another thought, he smashed a window with his beads and leapt out, snarling, “Yingshan Gu, you venomous hag! This isn’t over!”

**Chapter 2,493: A Necessary Ploy**

After Qu Guandao's retreat, the living room remained chaotic with skittering centipedes. A figure suddenly materialized like a whirlwind, moving too swiftly to track. Moments later, the newcomer halted, holding a transparent jar.

Yingshan Gu finally recognized him—Yang Cheng, current patriarch of the Yang Family. Clasping her fists, she said, “The Yang Patriarch’s skills live up to their reputation. Admirable.”

“A trivial act,” Yang Cheng replied. “I merely feared these poisons might harm my household. They’re yours to reclaim.” He tossed the jar containing the captured centipedes to her.

Yingshan Gu caught it gratefully. These centipedes were vital to her cultivation—years of effort invested. She’d only unleashed them today under dire circumstances.

“My sincere thanks,” she said. Losing them would have meant months of perilous hunting. Yet lingering to pursue the treasure map now seemed impossible.

Old Master Yang stood. “No gratitude needed. These insects matter little to us. Today, you’ve proven formidable indeed—driving off Qu Guandao himself. Few can claim that feat.”

“You flatter me. Fortune favored me,” Yingshan Gu demurred. “I’ll take my leave now, having overstayed.”

As she departed, Yang Cheng muttered, “Why allow such filth into our home? She’s a poison-dripping viper.”

“Necessity,” the old master sighed. “Qu Guandao demanded the nonexistent treasure map. He’s an old ally who once aided our family. Using her to repel him was... pragmatic.”

Yang Cheng nodded, though he ordered a thorough sweep for hidden toxins.

In the jianghu, Yingshan Gu was reviled as the “Latrine Maggot”—feared for her indiscriminate poisonings. Where she lingered, others fled.

“She’ll attend tomorrow’s auction,” the old master warned. “Station guards to restrain her. Deaths at our event would spell disaster.”

**Chapter 2,494: Prudent Avoidance**

That evening, Guan Yu delivered a forged treasure map on pigskin. “The auction’s centerpiece,” he declared.

Old Master Yang squinted at the scribbled lines. “Will bidders believe this?”

“None can authenticate what’s never been seen,” Guan Yu said. “Rumors claim the true map is pigskin. We profit either way.”

“Let’s hope greed blinds them,” the old master chuckled.

Guan Yu inquired about the day’s chaos. “Petty disturbances,” came the reply. “But beware Yingshan Gu—a venomous crone in embroidered slippers. She floats when walking, heels never touching ground.”

**Chapter 2,495: No Second Chances**

Later, traffic snarled as panicked crowds fled. “A snake! It’s eating someone!” a man screamed.

Guan Yu pushed forward, finding a seven-meter serpent constricting a victim. Beside it, a Tibetan mastiff futilely tugged its owner’s legs from the predator’s maw.

“He’s gone,” Guan Yu murmured. Xue Jing trembled behind him, deathly pale.

“Let’s leave!” she pleaded.

But curiosity anchored Guan Yu. Urban jungles shouldn’t harbor such beasts—a harbinger of darker tides swelling in A City’s underworld...
