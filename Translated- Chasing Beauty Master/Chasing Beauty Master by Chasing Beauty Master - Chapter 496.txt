Facing the crowd of astonished faces, Guan Yu knew his sudden appearance was rather abrupt. With no further chance to hide, he decisively leapt down from the tree.

Yet as he jumped, his foot slipped, nearly sending him tumbling. Fortunately, his exceptional balance allowed him to steady himself after a brief stagger. Still, the spectacle drew raucous laughter from the onlookers.

Brushing dust from his clothes under their scrutiny, Guan Yu heard someone call out, “Are you the friend from the Dragon Clan?”

At his nod, the crowd erupted in excitement. A few elven maidens even shrieked. Another voice chimed in, “Why don’t you have horns on your head?”

“Right! Dragons are supposed to be majestic divine beasts, but you look nothing like one!”

“You resemble a human exactly! Are you some infiltrator?”

Guan Yu faltered. Not only the elves—even he didn’t understand why he lacked draconic features or resembled a human. Yet this revealed a crucial detail: elves and humans here remained adversaries!

If they discovered his true identity, he’d likely be beaten senseless. Explaining his origins from another world would sound absurd.

Amid the clamor, Guan Yu sympathized with celebrities hounded by paparazzi—this was unbearable! He resolved to deflect their questions. “Quiet, everyone! Listen!”

The crowd hushed, and he seized the moment. “These are excellent questions! Even we dragons find it perplexing!”

“Don’t tell us you don’t know yourself!”

Guan Yu waved a hand. “Patience, elves! Haven’t you heard ‘Haste makes waste’?”

The elves blinked, shaking their heads innocently.

Remembering this world lacked tofu, Guan Yu sighed. “Never mind. But pay close attention, or don’t blame me for poor explanations!”

The elves leaned in, sharp ears twitching. Guan Yu felt the weight of their scrutiny—his entire story was fabricated. One misstep could unravel everything.

“Why no horns? Why look human? Let me explain: ‘A dragon’s nine offspring differ.’ Our bloodline is volatile. Nine children might resemble humans, dragons, or even elves!”

At the mention of dragon-elf hybrids, the crowd buzzed. A young elf shouted, “Are Dragon Clan maidens prettier than ours?”

Guan Yu grinned. “Need you ask? Of course Dragon Clan… pales next to elven beauty!”

Laughter erupted. Suddenly, whispers spread: “Training! The Instructor’s coming!”

“What? Now?!”

The elf who’d asked about beauty darted over—a boy around Aimi’s age, his gaze resolute despite his youth.

“Young Dragon Master, hide! The Instructor’s vicious!”

Guan Yu patted his shoulder. “No worries. I’m no pushover. You train—don’t let him scold you.”

The elf grinned. “I’m Balong. And you?”

“Guan Yu. Call me Brother Yu.”

“Brother Yu!” Balong’s innocent smile made Guan Yu muse: if everyone were like him and Aimi, how much pettiness would vanish? Adults here paled compared to children’s purity.

Balong returned to the training ground, divided into three sections: children nearest, adolescents and adults beside them, and a mixed group of all ages.

“How are they categorized?” Guan Yu wondered.

A sharp voice interrupted: “You! Who are you? What’s your business here?”

Turning, Guan Yu saw a middle-aged elf—the Instructor—and a hulking, two-meter-tall figure behind him. *An elf?* Normally shorter than humans, elves rarely exceeded 1.8 meters. This brute resembled a half-beast! Yet his pointed ears and attire confirmed it—a monstrously built elf.

As they sized each other up, the Instructor sneered, “Human, aren’t you? Why trespass in Elvenwood?”

“Can’t humans visit?” Guan Yu retorted.

The Instructor guffawed. “Naïve fool! Don’t you know elves and humans are at war? Need I list humanity’s crimes?”

Guan Yu laughed mockingly. Clearly, humans here were despised. Maintaining his dragon guise was crucial.

“Why laugh?” The Instructor scowled, eyeing Guan Yu like a madman.

“I laugh at your blindness!”

“You!” The Instructor’s aura turned murderous. A trainee elf rushed over, whispering, “Sir, he’s the Dragon Clan guest invited by our chief!”

“Dragon Clan?!” The Instructor’s rage dimmed, though suspicion lingered. “You… don’t look draconic.”

Guan Yu smirked. “I’ve explained this. Apologize respectfully, and I *might* repeat it.”

“Enough!” The Instructor snapped. “Prove you’re not human, or face consequences!”

“Try me.”

The hulking elf stepped forward. “Brother Instructor! Let me spar with him! If he’s truly dragonkin, our clan witnesses their might. If not…”

The Instructor’s eyes gleamed. “A fine idea—if the ‘dragon’ isn’t cowardly!”

A blatant provocation. Refusal meant mockery; acceptance, a trap. The crowd gathered eagerly—a historic elf-dragon clash!

Balong tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Brother Yu, don’t! Bandelie smashes boulders with his fists! Everyone fears him!”

Guan Yu patted his head. “Worry not. Brute force alone won’t prevail.”

To the crowd, he declared, “A spar? Simple. Here?”

Bandelie and the Instructor exchanged surprised glances. They’d expected refusal. Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, Bandelie wasn’t just strong—he was a high-level mage, combining physical and magical prowess. Yet his opponent was Guan Yu, a Nascent Soul realm expert from another world.

**Chapter 1257: Learning Through Combat**

The crowd formed a ring as the mismatched pair faced off—towering Bandelie versus lean Guan Yu.

“Yield now, boy,” Bandelie rumbled. “My strikes maim.”

“How fortuitous,” Guan Yu replied. “I too often ‘accidentally’ kill opponents. Give your all—no excuses later!”

Enraged, Bandelie roared, “Thunderous Fist!” Blue magic aura enveloped his fists as he lunged, aiming a crushing blow at Guan Yu’s head.

Instead of dodging, Guan Yu shifted slightly, channeling the force into his arm. The impact numbed his limb, hurling him back three steps. Yet the crowd gasped—Bandelie lay sprawled on the ground!

Cheers erupted, even from Bandelie’s former supporters.

“Silence!” The Instructor bellowed, face purple with humiliation. “Useless oaf! You disgrace me!”

Guan Yu eyed the Instructor contemptuously. Such callousness toward subordinates disgusted him.

Bandelie rose stubbornly. “That… was luck! Again!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Must you persist?”

“I’ll defeat you! Witness my true power!”

Though Bandelie’s stubbornness amused Guan Yu, prolonging this risked complications. “Very well. Use your best technique—I’m bored of feeble strikes.”

Unaware of Guan Yu’s ploy to study magic, Bandelie prepared Gale Slash—a mid-tier spell. The crowd buzzed:

“An earth-tier skill! The dragon’s doomed!”

“But he withstood the Thunderous Fist! He hasn’t even attacked yet!”

As Bandelie’s hands glowed deeper blue, Guan Yu analyzed the magic’s flow. This was his chance to grasp elemental manipulation.

When Bandelie struck, Guan Yu didn’t evade. Instead, he mirrored the spell’s energy pattern, channeling nascent elemental awareness. The clash erupted—not just of force, but of cunning adaptation.

The crowd gaped as Guan Yu, unscathed, redirected the Gale Slash into a whirlwind that lifted Bandelie off his feet. The hulk crashed down, dazed.

Murmurs swept through the elves: “He… he used Bandelie’s own spell against him!”

Guan Yu smiled inwardly. *Magic isn’t so different from qi manipulation. Time to end this.*

“Enough,” he declared. “Your strength is commendable, but technique lacks finesse.”

The Instructor seethed, while Bandelie stared in bewildered respect. Guan Yu’s reputation as a dragon—however dubious—was sealed.
