“Come on, it’s not like you’ll lose anything,” Guan Yu persisted shamelessly.

Gao Wei really wanted to smack him. How could this not count as a loss? Just as she prepared to refuse, her eyes suddenly sparkled with mischief. “Fine, I’ll agree, but you have to change the terms.”

“Name them!” Guan Yu said eagerly.

“If you fail, you have to watch the sunrise with me!” Gao Wei declared.

Their original purpose for coming out here had been to see the sunrise, but the assassination attempt had derailed those plans. Gao Wei had never stopped longing for it.

“Deal!” Guan Yu agreed without hesitation.

**Chapter 805: Food Snatcher**

Seeing Guan Yu agree so readily, Gao Wei suddenly felt like she’d been tricked, though she couldn’t pinpoint how.

Guan Yu inwardly laughed triumphantly. _This woman’s a bit naive!_

Suddenly, his brows twitched as he leaned close to Gao Wei and smirked. “The prey’s taken the bait. I’ll be waiting for that kiss.”

Gao Wei crossed her arms and glared. “Where’s the prey? Show me.”

“Follow me.” Guan Yu grinned, heading in a direction.

After walking seven minutes, Gao Wei looked around skeptically. “Where is it?”

Guan Yu pointed. Hidden in plain sight was a large snow-white rabbit grazing.

Before they could react, a piercing cry split the air. A massive black-and-white bird dove like a missile, talons outstretched toward the rabbit.

“Dammit! My prey!” Guan宇 roared, activating his Gravity System. Lightness enveloped him as he lunged, but the bird’s wings whipped up a gale that sent him sprawling.

The raptor speared the rabbit and soared away.

“Bastard! I’ll pluck your feathers next time!” Guan Yu shook his fist at the vanishing dot.

Gao Wei burst into laughter. “Looks like _I_ won the bet. You owe me a sunrise!”

“Watch this!” Guan Yu ignored her, fashioning a massive slingshot from branches and vines.

**Chapter 806: Beast vs. Beast**

At dawn, the raptor’s cry echoed. Guan宇 hauled his colossal slingshot uphill, Gao Wei in tow.

The giant bird circled above—snowy head, jet body, golden talons gleaming.

“Today you’ll witness archery fit for legends!” Guan宇 declared, loading a stone. The ancient coin in his mind blazed blue as he drew the titanic slingshot taut, eyes locked on his prey.

“Gravity System—Activate!”
