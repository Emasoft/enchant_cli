Huang Yating glanced at Guan Yu’s bitter melon-like expression—a perfect portrait of reluctance—and stifled a giggle behind her delicate hand before turning toward the inner suite. “President Guan, please follow me to review your office. If anything dissatisfies you, inform me, and I’ll arrange adjustments.”

Standing at 172 centimeters with a slender figure, alluring curves, refined features, and impeccable poise, Huang Yating prompted Guan Yu to inwardly lament: *This is undoubtedly a test! Assigning me such a secretary? Pure temptation! If I slip up and ‘handle’ her, it’ll spell trouble.*

His gaze drifted from her pert silhouette to the half-meter stack of documents on the desk. *Damn it. No need to ask—this must be the company data I’m supposed to digest.*

Huang Yating stood before the desk and turned with a practiced smile. “President Guan, these are partial records of Universal Group. President Du instructed me to ensure you familiarize yourself promptly. If physical copies displease you, digital versions are available on the computer. The choice is yours.”

Her perpetually professional smile unnerved Guan Yu. Though as striking as Sun Xiaoya, this girl exuded an unsettling robotic aura.

Unable to resist, he blurted, “Ah, Secretary Huang—forgive the impertinence—but are you human… or a robot?”

Her smile unchanged, she replied softly, “President Guan, I am Universal Group’s first-generation professional robot, currently in testing and unreleased. Presently, I am the sole model.”

Guan Yu sensed no human vitality from her, yet her confirmation stunned him. Pride swelled for Universal Group. While humanoid robots had existed for decades, none rivaled Huang Yating’s flawless mimicry of human movement and expression—a feat he’d never imagined possible.

Impulsively, he reached to touch her skin. To his surprise, she flinched, cheeks flushing as she retreated. “President Guan, it’s working hours. Please mind your conduct!”

She hurried back to her desk, leaving him dumbfounded. *I’ve been accused of harassment… by a robot! As if I’d assault a machine with my harem of beauties! I merely wished to inspect her human likeness!*

*Du Xiaojuan deliberately assigned this robot to torment me,* he fumed inwardly. *Just wait till tonight—I’ll repay this mischief tenfold!*

**Chapter 1697: A Merger Proposal**

Five minutes later, Guan Yu opened his door. “I’ve finished reviewing these. Bring the next batch.”

Huang Yating rose in shock. “Impossible! Thousands of pages processed so quickly? Even robots require time. How can a human achieve this?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Ordinary humans can’t. But I’m no ordinary man. Besides, if humans created you, naturally we’re superior.”

Using spiritual sense to memorize the documents had been child’s play—five minutes was generous. The breadth of Universal Group’s ventures astounded even him: aircraft manufacturing, real estate, military supply contracts, daily commodities… Every sector covered. *Twenty years… How much heartblood did Xiaojuan pour into this empire? Perhaps channeling all her love for me into this enterprise.*

“President Du stated you’d have no further tasks after reviewing these,” Huang Yating informed.

With duties concluded, Guan Yu returned to his office, cross-legged on the sofa as his consciousness enveloped Universal Tower. Thousands labored within. Suddenly, a familiar figure materialized at the entrance—Ouyang Yihan with a middle-aged man—halted by the same mutant woman who’d barred him yesterday.

After subduing Yu Zhengchun and Meng Feilong, Guan Yu had dispatched them to military authorities to plead leniency for the Ouyang Clan. Now, the family sought him here. Activating spatial shift, he vanished—reappearing instantly at the entrance.

“Guan Yu!” Ouyang Yihan exclaimed without surprise, while her father Ouyang Zhengdong and the mutant guard Wei Yan gaped at his teleportation.

Wei Yan, a second-class mutant, stared. “President Guan… How did you…?”

Ouyang Zhengdong marveled at the youthful hero—a living legend appearing younger than his daughter. Once admitted, discussions commenced in the eighth-floor conference room.

Du Xiaojuan joined post-management meeting. Ouyang Zhengdong laid bare their plight: coerced by military over weapons developed for Eastern Island rebels. Guan Yu remained silent until Ouyang Yihan snapped, “Where’s your sympathy? Can’t you help?”

Du Xiaojuan interjected gently, “Miss Ouyang, your family endangered national interests. We’re merely a corporation—powerless against military mandates.”

“Yu Zhengchun offered to steal back the weapons!” Yihan argued. “If Guan Yu went instead…”

Guan Yu nodded. “Eradicating Eastern Island extremists? Possible. But slaughtering innocents isn’t my way. However…” He turned to Zhengdong. “Recreate the weapons using your technicians’ memories. Succeed, and military pressure eases.”

Zhengdong clenched his jaw. “We propose a merger. Combine our enterprises to replicate the technology.”

**Chapter 1698: Compensate My Boyfriend**

Yihan gaped at her father’s bold gambit—offering their family’s prized assets. Unbeknownst to her, Zhengdong—a martial artist himself—recognized Guan Yu’s transcendent power during his teleportation display. With annihilation looming, aligning with Universal Group promised salvation and prosperity.

Du Xiaojuan’s eyes lit at the proposal—Ouyang’s cutting-edge tech dovetailed perfectly with Universal’s expansive but thinly stretched industries. As negotiations progressed, Guan Yu slipped away, retreating to his office.

Noting Huang Yating’s tireless work, he quipped, “Take a break. Fetch me coffee.”

“I’m a robot, President Guan,” she replied, pouring his cup. “We don’t rest—eternally energized. Isn’t that our advantage over humans?”

Before he could retort, a melodious voice interrupted: “President Guan, might I trouble you for coffee?”

Ouyang Yihan leaned against his doorframe, eyeing the opulent office. “How the mighty have risen. Even your secretary outshines me.”

Guan Yu spread his hands. “We’re aiding your family. Why the barbs?”

She circled his desk, perching on the armrest to grip his collar. “You cost me a powerful boyfriend. How will you compensate me?”

Guan Yu’s jaw dropped. “Yu Zhengchun? You hated his coercion!”

“I reconsidered!” she declared. “His willingness to risk death proves his devotion. Now, find me someone equally strong—young, handsome, tender, humorous, obedient…”

“Cease!” Guan Yu laughed. “Seeking Prince Charming or a robot?”

Yihan’s eyes sparkled. “Oh, there is one… right here.”

**Chapter 1699: The Perfect Man**

Guan Yu feigned ignorance as she elaborated her absurd criteria—a transparent ploy to claim him. When he suggested reuniting her with Yu Zhengchun, she nearly combusted.

“After your beating, he’d never dare!” she fumed. “No—I demand compensation! My ideal man must…”

Her ludicrous demands crescendoed until Guan Yu interrupted: “Does this paragon exist?”

Smirking, she sipped her coffee. “Indeed. He’s right here.” *Fool! Must I spell it out?*
