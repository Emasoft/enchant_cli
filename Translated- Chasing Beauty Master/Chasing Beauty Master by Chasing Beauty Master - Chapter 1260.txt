“A’ze whispered, ‘Guan Yu, are we good brothers?’ Guan Yu nodded. A’ze continued, ‘Brothers who drink merrily and make mistakes together, right?’

Guan Yu nodded again, utterly baffled by their implications. A’ze pressed, ‘Then Guan Yu, since we’re such close brothers, shouldn’t you tell us the truth?’

‘I’ve spoken nothing but the truth! Perhaps you’re overthinking things?’ Guan Yu said gloomily, as if he were the one being accused of lying.

Xiao Zhi, unwilling to beat around the bush, cut straight to the point. ‘Guan Yu, confess honestly—are you Master’s long-lost illegitimate child?’

Guan Yu froze, stunned by the accusation. A’ze added, ‘Tell the truth! No lies! Did Master give you such a precious magic artifact to make up for years of neglect?’

‘Exactly! Even my own father wouldn’t casually gift me something this valuable. You must be Master’s secret son—no doubt about it!’ Xiao Zhi declared with conviction.

Guan Yu’s frustration mounted. Out of nowhere, he’d been branded an illegitimate heir—a serious charge. If this reached Xuanming’s ears, he dreaded the consequences.

‘This is pure nonsense! How could I be Master’s illegitimate son? I have parents outside the sect!’ Guan Yu protested.

‘Impossible! If it were an ordinary artifact, fine—but something this precious? And Master even took you to seek Elder Jiu’s help to store spells? My own father wouldn’t do that for me!’ Xiao Zhi retorted, clearly skeptical and intent on digging deeper.

Guan Yu sighed. ‘How do I explain this? Master and I share no blood ties. Besides, he isn’t the only one who’s given me artifacts. Uncle Lu from Front Return Peak also gifted me one. Does that make me his illegitimate son too?’

‘What?! Another artifact?’ A’ze gaped in disbelief. ‘Uncle Lu gave you one too? What else do you have? Show us, you miser!’

Guan Yu relented, realizing they’d hound him all night unless he complied. He summoned the Soulfall Blade and Skyburner Furnace, holding them out for inspection. The sight drove Xiao Zhi and A’ze into a frenzy. Though unfamiliar with the artifacts, the potent energy radiating from them spoke volumes.

‘A’ze, hold me back!’ Xiao Zhi exclaimed theatrically. ‘With all these treasures, I might lose control and rob him!’

**Chapter 3,239: Yours to Keep**

A’ze mirrored his awe. Guan Yu’s trove of treasures had reshaped their perception of him—’domineering’ hardly sufficed.

‘Guan Yu, I’m in awe! Know why?’ Xiao Zhi gushed, as if the artifacts were his own. ‘You’re the first Cloud Azure disciple I’ve seen wielding so many treasures. It’s downright legendary!’

Guan Yu chuckled. ‘Just luck. My spiritual cultivation still lags far behind, despite these artifacts.’

A’ze interjected, ‘Now I’m convinced! Guan Yu must be the secret lovechild of Uncle Lu and Master. Why else would they shower him with such treasures? It’s the only explanation!’

‘Ridiculous! Why not claim I’m your and Xiao Zhi’s lovechild while you’re at it?’ Guan Yu shot back, half-amused. ‘Keep this up, and I’ll report you to Master!’

A’ze grinned sheepishly. ‘You won’t. But really—why else would they gift you these?’

Xiao Zhi finally sobered. ‘Guan Yu, put those away. Carrying such powerful artifacts at your cultivation level is asking for trouble. Others might kill to claim them.’

‘Exactly,’ A’ze agreed. ‘Even I’m tempted! If you weren’t Guan Yu, I might’ve struck already.’

Guan Yu groaned. ‘Enough about me! The Six Peaks Tournament match list is posted. Don’t you want to check it?’

‘After seeing your hoard, I’ve lost all motivation,’ A’ze grumbled. ‘Comparing ourselves to you is pure misery.’

‘Tell me about it!’ Xiao Zhi lamented. ‘Had I known you were this wealthy last night, I’d have drunk you under the table and stolen them!’

A’ze snorted. ‘You? Outdrink Guan Yu? He could drink you under the table using just his nose! Save your breath.’

‘It’s a joke!’ Xiao Zhi huffed. ‘Even if I could, I’d never dare steal from the sect leader and a peak master’s favorite. I’d be expelled!’

‘Wise words,’ A’ze teased.

Guan Yu shook his head, unfazed by their antics. A’ze pressed, ‘Seriously, why did Master and Uncle Lu gift you these?’

Guan Yu hesitated. Revealing his sealed status as a Boundary Sovereign was impossible—ordinary disciples couldn’t perceive it. Only high-level cultivators like Xuanming or Uncle Lu could.

‘Truth is,’ Guan Yu fabricated, ‘when I first arrived, both recognized my rare potential for dual magic-martial cultivation. They competed to take me as a disciple. Uncle Lu, fearing he’d lose to Master, offered his treasured Jade Scepter. Not to be outdone, Master gifted artifacts too. In the end, I received four treasures. Since I’d already gotten them, choosing Master as my mentor was obvious. Uncle Lu also took interest in my friend—a First-Class Sovereign he hopes to recruit as a guardian.’

‘Nonsense!’ A’ze scoffed. ‘Gifting supreme artifacts over a disciple rivalry? Unlikely! Xiao Zhi, you buying this?’

‘Not a word,’ Xiao Zhi agreed. ‘At least make your lies believable!’

Cornered, Guan Yu insisted, ‘It’s true! If you doubt me, so be it.’

Exchanging glances, A’ze and Xiao Zhi reluctantly conceded. If Guan Yu truly possessed dual cultivation talent, the sect’s investment made sense—such a prodigy could elevate Cloud Azure’s standing immensely.

**Chapter 3,240: Spectacle**

‘Guan Yu,’ A’ze probed, ‘where’s this First-Class Sovereign friend? At Front Return Peak?’

‘He’s a recluse,’ Guan Yu said. ‘Eats, drinks, sleeps. But Uncle Lu invited him to watch the tournament.’

Xiao Zhi whistled. ‘A Sovereign ally? No wonder they’re buttering you up! Those artifacts are a bargain if Uncle Lu recruits him.’

‘Exactly!’ A’ze deduced. ‘Uncle Lu probably targeted your friend first. The artifacts were just bait to cozy up.’

Guan Yu groaned as their wild theories spiraled. ‘Enough! Let’s check the match list.’

‘Wait!’ A’ze halted them. ‘You mentioned a Jade Scepter earlier. Why didn’t you show us?’

‘I gifted it to Siqi,’ Guan Yu admitted. ‘Her old sword was mediocre.’

Xiao Zhi paled. ‘You… gave her a supreme artifact?!’

‘Unbelievable!’ A’ze exclaimed. ‘Others would kill for a fraction of your luck!’

Xiao Zhi slumped. ‘I’ve spent months trying to give Siqi a trinket. Now she has a Jade Scepter? My gift’s trash compared to that!’

‘Face it,’ A’ze said, patting his back. ‘Even without Guan Yu, she might’ve rejected you. Supreme artifacts are irresistible.’

‘True,’ Xiao Zhi sighed. ‘But Guan Yu here—lovechild of a peak master and the sect leader? No competing with that!’

‘Hey!’ Guan Yu protested as they laughed.

‘Relax, “Illegitimate Son”,’ Xiao Zhi grinned. ‘When you’re a mighty lord, don’t forget us lowly brothers!’

**Chapter 3,241: A Glimmer of Conscience**

‘Of course!’ Guan Yu played along. ‘If I rise, you’ll be the first to benefit.’

‘At least you’re grateful,’ Xiao Zhi said, punching his shoulder. ‘Now, let’s check that list.’

As they walked, flanking Guan Yu like bodyguards, the latter marveled at his absurd fortune. Branded a secret heir, laden with artifacts, and center of relentless speculation—this was Cloud Azure life now.

Xiao Zhi and A’ze’s loyalty, he knew, stemmed from pragmatism. A future dual cultivator was worth currying favor with. But for tonight, camaraderie trumped ambition. The trio’s laughter echoed, cutting through the sect’s shadowed intrigues.
