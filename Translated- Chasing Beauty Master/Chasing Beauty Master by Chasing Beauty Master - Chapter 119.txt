“This little beauty is so adorable! Brother Yu, I’ve fallen head over heels… Feel my heart, ah, feel it—thump-thump-thump! I’m so blissful, I’ve found the taste of true love!” Wang Zhen whispered dramatically to Guan Yu with exaggerated gestures, looking utterly besotted.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes fiercely and turned his head away, too exasperated to look at him.

Zhao Jing’er stood shyly beside Liu Shilei.

“Classmates, we have a new student who arrived late due to family matters. Let’s welcome her with applause!” Liu Shilei introduced warmly to the class.

Clap-clap-clap! The sudden burst of applause startled Guan Yu again. When he turned, he saw nearly every male student clapping fervently, eyes shining as if their palms might burst. Wang Zhen, beside him, slapped his hands noisily, grinning like a fool.

Niu Le had been following Luo Cheng these past few days, busy with who-knows-what. After the incident, he’d gone to manage those businesses and seemed to be enjoying himself there. Even after Guan Yu returned, Niu Le hadn’t come back to the villa. If he were here, he certainly wouldn’t be as hysterical as these boys…

Thinking of Niu Le’s simple, loyal nature warmed Guan Yu’s heart. This brother had stood by him wholeheartedly. A man needed just one such companion in life—worth everything, fearlessly facing the world.

As he mused, Zhao Jing’er softly introduced herself: “Hello everyone, I’m Zhao Jing’er. I hope for your kindness in the future. Thank you.” After these two sentences, her face flushed pink. Unaccustomed to strangers and public speaking, her shyness only intensified the boys’ longing gazes.

Even Guan Yu’s heartbeat quickened at her bashful charm.

“Brother Yu, eh? Isn’t she stunning?” Wang Zhen, never forgetting his seatmate, noticed Guan Yu’s dazed stare and punched his thigh excitedly.

“Why are you acting like a monkey? Can’t you settle down?” Guan Yu shot him an exasperated look. Was this guy on stimulants? A rutting boar around pretty girls!

“Tsk-tsk… Not like you, Brother Yu! But understandable—this goddess makes any man feel unworthy. Hmm… In this whole class, only I, Wang Zhen, might have a chance to win her favor!” He grinned cheekily.

Mid-smirk, Wang Zhen froze, gaping slack-jawed as Zhao Jing’er walked straight toward him. Her gaze fixed on his sunny, handsome face.

Gulp! Guan Yu heard Wang Zhen’s loud swallow.

The class stared in astonishment. Despite empty seats up front, Zhao Jing’er had walked all the way back to Wang Zhen.

“Uh…” Wang Zhen remained frozen, teeth bared in a rigid smile.

Zhao Jing’er smiled demurely. “Hello…”

“H-hello! I’m Wang Zhen! So happy to meet you!” He sprang up, adjusting his collar before thrusting out a hand.

After a light handshake, she gestured to his seat. “May I sit here? Thank you.”

“Huh?” Wang Zhen blinked at his desk, confused.

“Class rules… no hugging allowed.” He whispered furtively, glancing at Liu Shilei.

Guan Yu facepalmed, wishing he could toss this idiot out the window. Was she asking to be hugged?!

Zhao Jing’er paused, then giggled. “I meant… could we swap seats? I’d like to sit here.”

“What? Why?” Wang Zhen looked utterly lost.

She tilted her head pleadingly toward Guan Yu.

“Ahem.” Guan Yu coughed, stood, and pointed behind. “Sit here.” Grabbing his books, he moved to the back.

Zhao Jing’er nodded sweetly, bypassed Wang Zhen, and settled beside Guan Yu with a radiant smile.

The classroom fell silent. Girls watched curiously; boys burned with envy. Was this sheer luck? Why’d the new beauty zero in on him?

From the podium, Liu Shilei looked most bewildered. Since when was this rascal such a lady-killer? This heavenly girl had claimed him instantly!

Recovering, Liu Shilei shot Guan Yu a meaningful look before clacking out angrily in her heels.

“That’s Shilei-jie. I’ll… go check on her,” Guan Yu whispered to Zhao Jing’er.

Chapter 291: I’ll Move In Too

Zhao Jing’er smiled sweetly.

Guan Yu knew Liu Shilei was upset. Understandable—no woman would feel comfortable seeing her man entangled with another.

He slipped out quietly, only to jump upon exiting—Liu Shilei leaned against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.

“Shilei-jie, I actually know Jing’er!” he whispered urgently.

“Obviously. Come.” She led him to the stairwell.

Guan Yu followed silently.

“Do you care about me?” she asked calmly.

“Of course! Jing’er’s just my sworn sister, really!”

“Really?”

“Absolutely!”

“What about Du Xiaojuan?”

“Uh…” He faltered.

“You’re living together now? No wonder you’ve avoided me.” Her voice trembled.

“It’s not like that! Nothing happened!”

“Not yet. What about later?”

Guan Yu fell silent.

“What’s your decision?” she pressed.

“About what?”

“Stop playing dumb!” She stomped his foot.

“Ow! Seriously, I don’t—”

“You’re breaking my heart!” She jabbed her chest, the movement making her bosom quiver enticingly.

He licked his lips. “Want me to… massage it?”

“Beast! I’m serious. Are you leaving me for her?”

“Never! How could I?!”

“So you’ll openly two-time?”

Two? Guan Yu winced inwardly—Feng Xin was practically his third!

Seeing his hesitation, Liu Shilei sighed. “I don’t mind… but will Xiaojuan? Hmm?”

His eyes widened. Was she… accepting this?

“What’s wrong? Reluctant?” Her lips trembled.

“No! I’m thrilled! I’ve missed you terribly!” He grinned wolfishly, eyeing her curves.

“Where are you looking?!” She blushed furiously.

“Remember your promise? That night in your dorm, you moaned that I could have you anytime—”

“Stop!” She pinched his arm, scarlet-faced. “That… that was the heat of the moment!”

He pouted. “You said it, though.”

Her shy fury intoxicated him. If only he could embrace her here!

“You’re so beautiful. Let me hold you,” he whispered.

“Here? Are you mad?!” She backed against the wall.

“No one’s around…” He stepped closer.

“No! What if someone sees?!”

“Just a quick hug. Please?” He gave puppy-dog eyes.

“Absolutely not! Stop that!” She stamped, torn between refusal and his pleading look.
