During their winter break, Guan Yu had promised Liu Shilei to bring her home for the New Year—an implicit commitment that spoke volumes.

Liu Shilei’s family lived in M City, adjacent to L City. The drive wasn’t far, so they decided to take a car. Of course, Guan Yu wouldn’t be the one driving; that task fell to Lin Dong, his newly acquired subordinate.

As for why Lin Dong accompanied Guan Yu home, it traced back to a conversation where Guan Yu learned Lin Dong had been an orphan since childhood, spending every holiday alone. Moved by this, Guan Yu invited him to celebrate the New Year together. Initially, Lin Dong refused outright, but under Guan Yu’s insistence as his “boss,” he reluctantly agreed.

They arrived in M City by noon. Guan Yu called Liu Shilei, whose voice brimmed with excitement. They agreed on a meeting spot, and Lin Dong drove there to wait.

Soon, Liu Shilei appeared before Guan Yu in casual home attire: black linen cotton pants, a blue padded jacket over a white T-shirt. Her oval face glowed, crescent-moon eyebrows arched in a smile, bright eyes locked onto Guan Yu, and lips so delicate they invited a kiss. Her hastily tied hair added a touch of慵懒美—a lazy charm. Even Lin Dong, whom Guan Yu often teased as a “blockhead” in matters of love, was struck by her ethereal beauty.

Liu Shilei sat across from Guan Yu, smiling. “You’re here.”

“Things have been busy. I’m sorry it took so long,” Guan Yu replied apologetically.

Liu Shilei was his first woman. Though their beginning had been messy, she’d become his. He loved her deeply yet carried a thread of guilt. Her devotion, tolerance, and generosity deserved a lifetime of cherishing. So here he was, to take her home to meet his parents and celebrate the New Year.

“It’s fine,” she said softly. “There are still days until the New Year.”

“True, but before heading home, we ought to visit your parents. If I just whisk their daughter away, who knows if they’ll ever let me through their door again?” Guan Yu naturally slid beside her, clasping her hand.

Liu Shilei rolled her eyes, her heart brimming with happiness.

“By the way, Shilei-jie, let me introduce my brother, Lin Dong.” Guan Yu hadn’t forgotten his friend amidst his romantic pursuits.

Liu Shilei displayed the grace and poise befitting Guan Yu’s partner, putting others at ease effortlessly.

Lin Dong’s sincere remark nearly made Guan Yu throttle him: “What a fresh flower stuck in cow dung.”

“If I couldn’t beat you, I’d make you taste that cow dung firsthand,” Guan Yu grumbled.

“Tch.” Lin Dong shot him a dismissive glance, wounding Guan Yu’s pride. Liu Shilei stifled a laugh.

Knowing he’d gain no ground with Lin Dong, Guan Yu turned to Liu Shilei. “Free this afternoon?”

She shook her head.

Leaning close, he whispered, “Let’s hurry and handle business.”

Her face flushed crimson as she glared at him. Guan Yu feigned innocence. “Why so red? What were you thinking? I meant shopping for your parents! We can’t show up empty-handed.”

Had she misunderstood? Knowing Guan Yu’s tendencies, perhaps—but he’d turned the tables. She pinched his waist in retaliation.

Lin Dong tactfully vanished.

Of course, Guan Yu’s “business” wasn’t merely teasing. They soon booked a presidential suite at M City’s finest hotel for humanity’s oldest dance.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Were it not for dinner plans with her parents, Guan Yu would’ve battled till dawn.

Post-“reunion,” Liu Shilei clung to his arm like a blushing bride as they strolled streets, shopping for gifts.

Guan Yu’s earnestness showed. He quizzed her on her parents’ preferences, appropriate gifts for first meetings, and even factored in her younger brother.

Appearance mattered too. Guan Yu insisted they dress sharply, dragging Lin Dong into a makeover. “Your slob style ruins my heroic image,” he declared.

Liu Shilei’s heart melted.

They chose a mid-tier restaurant—not Guan Yu’s preference, but Liu Shilei worried about his finances. Guilt gnawed at him; he still hadn’t revealed his true circumstances or other romantic entanglements. He resolved to confess everything tonight.

In the private dining room, Guan Yu stood before Liu Shilei. “Do I look presentable?”

She adjusted his collar tenderly. “Perfect. They’ll adore you.”

Guan Yu flashed a bright grin.

Lin Dong teased, “So nervous over in-laws?”

“Sour grapes,” Guan Yu retorted.

Nerves were inevitable. Though he’d met Du Xiaojuan’s parents before, this felt different—a true son-in-law test with zero certainty.

The door opened. A middle-aged couple entered with a teenage boy.

Guan Yu greeted them warmly. “Uncle, Auntie, I’m Guan Yu, here to take my wife home for New Year.”

**Chapter 677: Opposition**

Guan Yu’s bluntness mirrored his afternoon approach—no foreplay, straight to action. Desperation and inexperience justified his directness. Success mattered, not grace.

Liu Shilei’s parents froze. Her mother offered a polite smile; her father and brother ignored Guan Yu, sitting to scrutinize him.

Awkwardness hung thick until Liu Shilei intervened, linking arms with Guan Yu. “Mom, Dad, this is my boyfriend. He brought gifts.” She presented supplements for her parents and an iPhone 5S for her brother. “Liu Jie, thank your future brother-in-law.”

Liu Jie, sporting a wild hairdo, sneered, refusing the phone. Liu Shilei’s face darkened, but Guan Yu stopped her outburst.

Her mother, Cheng Yufang, accepted the gifts. “You shouldn’t have spent so much.”

“Your health is priceless,” Guan Yu replied.

Cheng Yufang beamed—proof of the adage “mothers-in-law dote on sons-in-law.”

Her father, Liu Bingrong, scoffed. “Who knows if these are even real? Scams abound.”

“They’re his sincere gesture!” Cheng Yufang protested.

Liu Bingrong silenced her with a glare. Guan Yu noted the family dynamics—mother subservient, daughter helpless.

“Sit,” Liu Bingrong commanded. Guan Yu obeyed, the picture of respect.

Lin Dong watched, amused. The Guan Yu who ruled N City now humbled before in-laws? Priceless.

“Age?” Liu Bingrong demanded.

“Twenty.”

“Twenty? Occupation? Family?”

“I’m a freshman at Shilei’s university. My father’s a construction worker. My mother passed when I was young.”

“A student? Her student?!” Liu Bingrong’s face darkened. He slammed the table. “Liu Shilei! You shame our family! A teacher-student affair? You’ve disgraced us!”

“I’m not ashamed,” Liu Shilei said firmly. “I choose him.”

Liu Bingrong raised a hand to strike her, but Guan Yu caught his wrist.

“Uncle,” Guan Yu said calmly, “you’ve loved. True love needs no outsiders’ approval—only happiness.”

“Don’t lecture me!” Liu Bingrong yanked free. “Love won’t feed her. What can you offer?”

“My hands and heart.”

“Idiot,” Liu Jie muttered.

Guan Yu ignored him.

“A dependent student? You can’t even pay for dates! How dare you promise her happiness? You’re taking her nowhere!”

“I can provide the best life,” Guan Yu insisted.

“Empty words!” Liu Bingrong sneered. City disdain for rural roots oozed.

“Dad, it’s true!” Liu Shilei remembered Guan Yu’s lavish jewelry gifts.

“Silence!”

Liu Bingrong stood. “My daughter deserves a millionaire. You’re unworthy. This farce ends now.”

He stormed out with wife and son.

Liu Shilei remained. “I’m staying.”

“Cheng Yufang!” Liu Bingrong barked.

Torn, Cheng Yufang hesitated.

Guan Yu intervened. “Go with them. Don’t strain family ties.”

**Chapter 678: Difficulties**

Reluctantly, Liu Shilei left, casting longing glances. Guan Yu maintained composure, determined to win her father over.

Alone with Lin Dong, Guan Yu sighed. “Should we eat?”

Lin Dong smirked. “Your father-in-law’s a materialist. Reveal your wealth—he’ll grovel.”

“Emotionally illiterate fool,” Guan Yu retorted. “True bonds aren’t bought. I need to mend her family, not bribe them.”

“Manipulating even in-laws? If I were him, I’d disown you.”

“You’ll understand when you meet yours.”

After the meal, Guan Yu returned to the presidential suite, where Lin Dong watched cartoons.

“Wasted room,” Guan Yu muttered.

He’d strategize tomorrow. For now, exhaustion reigned.
