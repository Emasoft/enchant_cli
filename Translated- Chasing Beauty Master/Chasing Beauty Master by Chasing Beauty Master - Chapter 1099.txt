“Your cultivation is impressive, Lady Benefactor. Had I known your group included women, I would never have permitted your stay here. I must ask you to leave the mountain at once,” Shen Sheng spoke while parrying blows, sweat beading his brow.

Jiu Biyun pressed her assault with ruthless efficiency, each strike aimed at vital points. Though Shen Sheng’s Second-Class Sovereign cultivation allowed him to hold his ground temporarily, he now found himself purely defensive, devoid of any opening to counter. The woman before him was unmistakably a First-Class Sovereign—a realm far beyond his own.

Yuan Shanding watched the spectacle with grim satisfaction. Jiu Biyun’s dominance was evident; it was only a matter of time before Shen Sheng fell. With three monks soon to be eliminated, their mission seemed straightforward. Yet Yuan’s temper flared as his gaze landed on Shi Gu, the insolent child who’d earlier defied him. Seizing the opportunity while Shen Sheng was occupied, he barked, “You little runt! Come here! Let me teach you some manners!”

Shen Sheng’s voice cut through the chaos, urgent: “Shi Gu! Run and fetch your martial uncles!”

The boy scrambled toward the rear halls, but Yuan snarled to his men, “After him! Don’t let that brat escape!”

Distracted, Shen Sheng faltered. Jiu Biyun’s fist struck his left shoulder, numbing agony radiating through his arm. *Hold on just a little longer. Let Shi Gu bring help before this woman kills me,* he thought desperately.

Yet Yuan, a brute devoid of strategy, fixated on tormenting the child rather than aiding Jiu Biyun. Had he joined forces with her earlier, Shen Sheng would already lie defeated.

Shi Gu’s cries echoed as Yuan’s reinforcements arrived. “Uncle Big Beard! Uncle You Guang! Uncle Xiao Bai! They’re attacking!”

Xiao Bai’s keen ears caught the distress. “Trouble’s come. Move!”

They emerged to find Yuan throttling Shi Gu mid-air, the boy’s face purpling. Without hesitation, Xiao Bai became a blur—a dagger flashed, and Yuan howled as blood gushed from his slashed wrist.

“Coughing violently, Shi Gu clutched his bruised neck. Xiao Bai thrust a phone into his hands. “Call Guan Yu. Quietly. Tell him we’re under siege.”

Outside, Yuan’s men swarmed. Big Beard swung his iron staff like a tempest, You Guang darting alongside him. Yet against over twenty Second-Class Sovereigns, their defense crumbled.

“Surrender now, and I’ll only break your legs!” Yuan taunted, nursing his bandaged wrist.

Xiao Bai, encircled by foes, shouted, “Don’t fight to the death! Find an escape!”

But Big Beard roared, “I’ll hold them! You flee!” His staff whirled madly, cracking against weapons until his arms trembled from the impacts.

Meanwhile, Shen Sheng danced at the edge of death. Jiu Biyun’s relentless pursuit drove him beyond the temple gates. A vicious kick sent him sprawling, breathless and bleeding. *The gap between Sovereign ranks is insurmountable,* he realized bitterly.

As clashes echoed from the front hall, Xiao Bai’s trio formed a defensive triangle, backs pressed together. “Did Shi Gu reach Guan Yu?” he muttered. Hope dwindled with each passing second.

Jiu Biyun sneered, closing in on the crippled Shen Sheng. “Your speed won’t save you forever.” Her palm glowed with lethal intent—

—When a sudden tremor shook the earth. Distant footsteps thundered, growing louder. Guan Yu’s voice boomed across the mountainside: “Who dares touch my disciples?”

The tide was about to turn.
