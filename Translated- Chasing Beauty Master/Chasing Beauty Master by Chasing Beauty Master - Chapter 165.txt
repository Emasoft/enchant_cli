Moreover, the biting cold wind had triggered an alarming fever in Zhao Jing’er’s body—a disastrous turn that compounded their plight.

Guan Yu’s mind grew restless. Stabilizing her condition took precedence, regardless of the dangers ahead.

“Don’t panic, don’t panic. Stay calm, stay calm.” He inhaled deeply, steadying himself.

Resolve hardening, he murmured softly, “Jing’er, turn toward me slowly without standing up. Keep your face toward me.”

Though dazed and on the verge of collapse, Zhao Jing’er retained enough clarity to painstakingly shift her position.

Guan Yu’s heart clenched at the sight of her pallid face.

She blinked at him in confusion. He offered a gentle smile before moving his hand from her head to rest over her left breast, his gaze refocusing intently on the road.

A faint blush bloomed across her ashen cheeks as warmth seeped into her body from his touch, carrying a tingling sensation that revitalized her weary limbs. Tears welled in her eyes—he was healing her, albeit weaker than before. Even in this dire moment, he prioritized her safety.

Guan Yu, however, wrestled with dread. Activating his healing system now risked depleting his energy reserves, dooming them both. Yet withholding it would condemn her. Though he’d stocked chocolates and charged electric batons in the backseat, the chaos of evading gunfire left no chance to retrieve them.

He minimized the energy output, praying to sustain her until escape. But even at reduced levels, the strain drained him. Pallor crept over his face as he clung to sheer willpower. He had to end this threat before exhaustion claimed him.

Unbeknownst to him, greater peril loomed.

Ahead, ten minutes’ drive away, a rugged Hummer idled illegally on the highway’s shoulder. Leaning against it was a lean-framed man in his thirties, dressed in fitted casualwear. A Honghe cigarette dangled unlit from his lips, its tip smoldering. His languid posture belied the sharp lethality in his gaze.

As the cigarette burned to its filter, he swallowed the butt and spat it out, crushing it underfoot before sliding into the driver’s seat. “Time to work,” he muttered, flooring the accelerator.

To any observer, his actions would have defied logic: he sped against traffic, weaving through oncoming vehicles with preternatural precision.

Guan Yu’s ordeal had only just begun.

**Chapter 406: Car Crash**

Minutes stretched into agonizing hours. Guan Yu finally withdrew his hand from Zhao Jing’er’s chest—his energy reserves teetered on empty. Reluctantly, he gripped the steering wheel.

Though bundled in winter layers, her coat had slipped during the electric treatment, exposing her pale curves. He hastily readjusted her clothing.

Flushed and tear-streaked, she nestled into his embrace, arms encircling his waist.

His waning strength slowed their pace. The pursuing Mercedes seized the chance to surge alongside. Its rear window lowered, revealing the gunman’s smirk as he leveled a pistol at Guan Yu’s head.

Cold sweat dripped down Guan Yu’s spine. One final burst from his gravity system might dodge this bullet—but what then? Yet refusal meant instant death. Trapped.

Then, a glint of hope: a lumbering truck ahead.

A vicious grin curled his lips. He slammed the accelerator, inching the Hummer forward. The Mercedes matched the acceleration, closing in recklessly.

Gunfire erupted. A bullet grazed Guan Yu’s cheek, drawing blood. More shots followed, each near-miss tightening the noose.

With a roar, he channeled his last energy. The ancient copper coin in his mind hummed, gravity system flaring. Forty percent reduction slammed onto the Mercedes.

The Mercedes lurched uncontrollably, catapulting past its limits. Before its occupants could react, they collided with the truck’s rear. Metal crumpled. The car flipped violently, landing as a mangled wreck.

Guan Yu exhaled—threat neutralized. But exhaustion dragged him toward oblivion. He managed to park before slumping, barely conscious.

Zhao Jing’er stirred, gasping at his ghastly state: bloodied, pallid, barely alive. Guilt and grief overwhelmed her.

Before he could reassure her, another Hummer barreled toward them—against traffic, hellbent on collision.

**Chapter 407: Heart-Stopping Moment**

Zhao Jing’er froze as Guan Yu yanked her down, shielding her with his body. Her mind flitted to a tabloid headline—“car sex”—before the world upended.

The attacker’s Hummer sideswiped theirs, exploiting its weak points. Guan Yu’s vehicle teetered, then flipped.

Crushed beneath Zhao Jing’er in the wreckage, Guan Yu fought to stay conscious. His legs were pinned; reaching the electric batons seemed impossible.

Outside, the assailant lit another Honghe, indifferent to the gasoline pooling at his feet. He dropped the cigarette.

Flames erupted. The Hummer exploded in a fireball.

Yet Guan Yu emerged, energy renewed by a scavenged baton. He lunged at the man, unleashing a Bone-Shattering Fist combo—only to stagger back, his foe barely budging.

“Not bad,” the man remarked, amused. “You made me retreat two steps.”

Guan Yu glared, fury burning as he glimpsed Zhao Jing’er’s unconscious form. “Your target’s me?” he demanded coldly.
