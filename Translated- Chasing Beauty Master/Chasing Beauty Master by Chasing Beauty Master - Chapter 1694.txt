“Say what you will,” Lin Chen said with a laugh. “Though you, Guan Yu, usually appear clever, I never expected you to grasp the essence of our Yunqing Sect so profoundly in such a short time. You show great promise.”

Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated being outmaneuvered by Lin Chen. It was clear the latter wished to end the conversation—Lin Chen was no fool, sharper than a monkey. Extracting direct truths from him now seemed nearly impossible.

“Senior Brother Lin Chen,” Guan Yu pressed, “you must be cautious of Ling Su. Should we not expel him? Sending him back to the sect would spare us all from danger here.”

**Chapter 4431: A Guilty Conscience**

“That won’t do. Expelling him would be convenient,” Lin Chen mused. Driving Ling Su away would indeed be advantageous, freeing him to pursue Siqi without interference. “But you lack justification. Even as team leader, you cannot dismiss someone without cause. Others would protest.”

Another consideration solidified Lin Chen’s resolve: if Ling Su returned to Yunqing Sect now, Xuanming would interrogate him. All Lin Chen’s secrets would unravel. Ling Su would deny gambling away the silver or owing two hundred taels, and Xuanming would dispatch enforcers. Ling Su must remain here.

“He hasn’t crossed the line yet,” Lin Chen declared. “Let’s ignore his petty provocations.”

“Not crossed the line?” Guan Yu feigned shock. “He wants you dead! If I accuse him of murderous intent to justify expulsion, none would object. Besides, he’s bullied fellow disciples mercilessly. None would mourn his departure.”

Lin Chen shook his head. “Without evidence, accusations of murder hold no weight. Even if he’s detestable, unsubstantiated claims won’t sway others.”

Guan Yu frowned. Lin Chen’s refusal baffled him. Were their positions reversed, Guan Yu would eagerly rid himself of Ling Su—eliminating both a rival for Siqi’s affections and a mortal threat. Yet Lin Chen inexplicably shielded the man.

“You’re right,” Guan Yu conceded. “Without proof or Master’s approval, we cannot act rashly.”

“Though dangerous, there’s no need for fear,” Lin Chen reassured. “Stay vigilant. Once we secure evidence, expulsion will be the least of his worries.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. So Lin Chen wasn’t protecting Ling Su—he awaited an opportunity to deliver graver consequences.

Changing tactics, Guan Yu asked, “Since Salt Marsh Senior Brother’s exposure, you’ve become Master’s favorite. Did you follow my advice during your recent return?”

“Indeed!” Lin Chen chuckled, patting his waist where a hidden five-hundred-tael note lay. “I blamed everything on Ling Su—the lost silver, the debt. Master nearly recalled him immediately. Only my pleading stayed his hand.”

Guan Yu smirked. “My plan served you well. Had you confessed, you’d still be punished at the sect. But now, if Ling Su returns, Master will uncover the truth.”

“Precisely why he stays,” Lin Chen agreed. “Let him bluster. With your golden scale artifact, he dare not disobey. When evidence emerges, we’ll settle accounts.”

Guan Yu finally understood—Lin Chen feared being implicated. Keeping Ling Su here delayed confrontation with Xuanming.

“Ling Su despises you,” Guan Yu warned. “Stay alert.”

“I’ve long been prepared,” Lin Chen boasted, though Guan Yu recalled his near-incineration two nights prior. The memory prompted silent derision.

As Guan Yu considered provoking Ling Su privately, his gaze drifted to Siqi. She rode a camel apart from the group, clutching the jade lion he’d gifted her. Though their newfound intimacy remained secret, her stolen glances betrayed both warmth and anxiety. She longed to announce their bond at the sect, envisioning open affection after this mission.

**Chapter 4432: Spectacle**

The journey dragged under a sinking sun. As cold seeped through thick robes, the caravan neared Camel Town—two hours distant. Suddenly, shouts and torchlight erupted ahead.

“A bonfire gathering?” Wang Jun grinned. “Let’s investigate! After this dreary day, some revelry—”

“Those are battle torches,” Guan Yu interrupted. “Bandits ambushing merchants, likely. Keep distance.”

At Aze’s signal, the group halted. Wang Jun volunteered to scout, slipping through mosquito-ridden grass until the scene clarified—fifty mounted bandits encircling a merchant convoy.

“Hand over all silver!” roared their leader, blade at an old man’s throat. “Or my brothers will strip your corpses!”

When pleas of poverty failed, the bandit chief slashed a wagon. Screams revealed two young women hidden beneath quilts. “Bonus prizes!” he leered, dragging the merchant’s daughters forth.

“Take everything!” the old man begged. “But spare my girls!”

“Too late,” the bandit sneered. “The silver, goods, and wenches are ours!”

**Chapter 4433: Claiming All**

Wang Jun watched, revolted, as the bandits tightened their noose. The merchants’ terror mirrored his own group’s vulnerability—heavy-laden and exposed on this barren trail. Any misstep could draw the marauders’ attention, spelling disaster for all.
