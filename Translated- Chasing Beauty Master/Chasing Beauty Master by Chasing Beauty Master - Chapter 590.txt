Guan Yu smoothly ascended to the position of tribal Hunting Captain. When the previous captain handed over the scepter, he warned that if Guan Yu failed to lead the hunting team well, he would not let him off easily. Upon returning, the maidservant repeatedly remarked on his great fortune, stating that had the snake been cursed, he would never have escaped so luckily.

Only now did Guan Yu realize his earlier impulsiveness. No longer obsessed with mere scraps of meat, his self-made bow ensured he could sustain himself independently. As he contemplated leaving, sudden concern for the Queen gripped him.

Clearly, the villains and witch conspired together, coveting the Queen's position. From the maidservant, Guan Yu learned this tribe allowed only women to rule. Every three years, young unmarried girls were sent on trials abroad. Those surviving after three years gained Queen candidacy and could choose subordinates as consorts.

"If only one returns, she becomes Queen directly. The Wild Woman was the Queen's most beloved child. She's been gone five years now. Had you not brought news, many would think her dead. When she returns, the second batch will begin arriving."

Finally understanding why the witch and villains sought to expel him—they feared he'd inform the Queen about the Wild Woman's whereabouts, undermining the witch's sister's advantage—Guan Yu resolved to stay and help eliminate these threats while honing his skills.

Though Guan Yu's snake-eating feat caused a stir, his faction remained weaker. Through the maidservant, he gathered loyalists without revealing his plans, awaiting the right moment to test their allegiance.

To counter the witch, Guan Yu instituted modern training—running, push-ups—to build strength and endurance. Resistance met his unexplained methods. Enforcing discipline through authority, he drove his team's hunting performance below rivals. After a month of complaints about his incompetence, Guan Yu remained unfazed.

At the month's end, he revealed prepared bows. Initial skepticism vanished when Guan Yu felled a sprinting beast at ten meters, silencing doubters.

Under public pressure, the Queen declared Guan Yu would lose his position if performance didn't improve within half a month. His team seethed with indignation yet finally grasped his deeper purpose.

When Guan Yu hesitated to attend, Huo Lingling glared. "What nonsense! How could I go without you? Forget it—I won't go either!"

Guan Yu sighed, seeing through her feigned indifference. "Enough pretense. Let's go together."

He then spotted a striking woman in crimson—Liu Piaopiao from Jinzhou City, now exuding intensified allure. "Truly a calamitous enchantress," he murmured.

A girlish huff sounded in his ear. "Eyes glued? Shall I summon her for closer inspection?"

Huo Lingling, Huntian Sect's most vexing maiden, surveyed beauties as rivals—especially those eyeing "her" man. Guan Yu quickly diverted: "Even Jinzhou Auction House attends?"

"Of course. Their success owes much to that woman. What do men see in her?" Lingling's tone turned vinegary. Guan Yu's glance flickered between her modest bosom and Liu's dramatic curves.

Though subtle, Lingling noticed. Blushing fiercely, she glared. Guan Yu coughed, averting his gaze.

"Look—who's that?" Lingling pointed to a woman calmly seated beside a white-clad noble. Guan Yu frowned. "Wu Yuying, the genius from three years ago. Grand Elder Suoluo said she entered Blade Edge Academy. Why has she returned?"

As they spoke, Wu Yuying noticed them. Recognizing Guan Yu, her lips curled disdainfully. He smiled wryly—such arrogance from "geniuses" was routine.

"Brother Guan, she seems hostile," Lingling observed.

Guan shrugged. "Returning from elite training, she's earned the right to swagger. But past glories mean nothing here."

As Wu Yuying approached, Guan Yu's expression soured.

"You're Guan Yu?" she drawled, hips swaying.

"Does it matter?" he retorted.

"Little Hai was right—you're all thorns." Her lecturing tone grated.

Guan Yu's eyes roamed her legs. "Such tempting limbs. Pity we've not tested their... prowess."

Flushing crimson, she spat, "Lewd cur! I thought you merely arrogant, but you're outright vulgar!"

"Afraid of something?" Guan Yu taunted.

Stammering, she hissed, "I won't waste words! Why would the Sect Master favor trash like you?"

"Ah—fear the Sect Master? Wise. We're close. Strike me, and you'll regret it." His leer made her shudder.

With a metallic shing, her blade flashed. Guan Yu smirked. "Dare you? Even with permission, what could you do?"

"You insolent whelp! Think topping brats makes you my equal?" Her shoulder's five blue sparks revealed Grand Mage status—a full tier above his Senior Mage level. Yet Guan Yu scoffed, "I fear many, but never women."

Her sword trembled with rage. The insult to her womanhood—long buried under tomboyish attire—struck deep. "You'll pay for this, lecher!"

As steel sang, chaos erupted elsewhere. During Hu Xiaohai's attempt to seize Crimson Sun Grass, Guan Yu barreled through the crowd, sending the bully tumbling. Gasps filled the air as onlookers recognized the intervenor.

"Bastard!" Hu roared, rising. "Last time's beating wasn't enough?"

"The herb's yours! Stop this!" pleaded the fallen sisters.

Hu sneered. "I'll take both herb and flesh!"

Guan Yu scooped up the plant, mirroring Hu's words. Laughter erupted. "Mad from beating?" Hu jeered, charging with metallic skin gleaming.

Their fists collided—but this time, Hu flew backward, bloodied. The crowd gaped. Guan Yu stood firm, skin shimmering—proof of Breakthrough cultivation.

"Impossible! You reached Qi Refinement?" Hu choked.

Another punch sent Hu sprawling. Guan Yu gazed coldly at the groaning bully. The sisters stared, awestruck by this transformed defender.
