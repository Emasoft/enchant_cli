Poison Widow clearly remembered that within the Yu Gang existed a supreme expert. The master who injured Luo Bo might very well be among these people now; otherwise, they wouldn’t dare speak to her so brazenly.

She realized she couldn’t afford to delay any longer. If Guan Yu arrived, matters would escalate disastrously. He might capture her outright and extort Bill Lin for more ransom—a scenario she fully believed him capable of orchestrating.

Gritting her teeth, Poison Widow said with a pained heart, “Very well. We have an agreement. Six million, and I take my people.”

Jia Bo nodded in satisfaction. “Smart choice. Best not oppose our Yu Gang again—you’ll only suffer.”

Poison Widow seethed with regret. The million she’d painstakingly embezzled hadn’t even warmed her hands before being snatched away. After confirming the funds, Jia Bo waved dismissively. “Let them go. Clear the road and send these vermin scurrying.”

**Chapter 2942: What Do You Need Me For?**

Jia Bo’s mood lifted as he eyed the freshly deposited funds, earlier grievances forgotten. Once Poison Widow’s group vanished, he prepared to inform Guan Yu.

A Xiangzhu approached and whispered, “Elder, you handled today well. Perhaps we could… redistribute some of this money…”

Jia Bo shook his head sternly. “Our leader treats us fairly. We won’t betray that trust. Besides, tonight’s damages to the bar and wellness club will require these funds to placate him. Any embezzlement would see us expelled from the Yu Gang.”

Though he chastised the underling, Jia Bo privately lamented—had fewer witnesses been present, he might have skimmed a portion. But with fifty brothers watching, leaks were inevitable. His immediate concern was explaining the night’s events without losing his newly appointed managerial position.

When Guan Yu answered the call, his voice held calm curiosity. “What do you need?”

“Boss, Poison Widow sent forty men to trash our establishments,” Jia Bo reported evenly.

“Casualties?”

“Half fled; we captured the rest. Poison Widow paid six million in ransom. The bar sustained minor damage, but the wellness club was ravaged.”

Guan Yu found the outcome acceptable. “Tend to the wounded and close for tonight. I’ll assess tomorrow.”

Jia Bo blinked in surprise—he’d expected Guan Yu’s immediate arrival. Unbeknownst to him, Guan Yu was occupied at the leather factory’s surveillance room, interrogating Jing Boyan, a disheveled technician formerly under Sun Xu’s command.

“How long did you serve Sun Xu?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Boss, I don’t understand—”

“Enough theatrics,” Guan Yu interrupted. “Switch allegiances, and I’ll double whatever he pays. My word binds.”

Jing Boyan trembled, his grease-stained coveralls and unwashed hair amplifying his pitiable demeanor. “Please don’t fire me! My children need—”

“We’re both adults,” Guan Yu cut in. “Persist in this charade, and you leave now. But know this—Sun Xu’s sinking ship offers no future. Serve me, and your life improves tenfold.”

**Chapter 2943: Leisurely Existence**

Jing Boyan’s eyes sharpened momentarily. “And if Sun Xu discovers my betrayal?”

“Remain within these walls, and you’re under my protection. Within days, I’ll purge all Sun Xu loyalists. Your safety hinges on cooperation.”

Wang Hu, Guan Yu’s lieutenant, snapped impatiently, “Sun Xu’s a dead man walking! Cling to him, and you’ll share his fate!”

After prolonged negotiation, Jing Boyan knelt abruptly, kowtowing thrice. “From this moment, I serve only you, Elder.”

“Rise,” Guan Yu commanded. “Your role remains covert—a shadow member of Yu Gang. First task: name Sun Xu’s moles here.”

Jing Boyan scribbled a list. “These workers steal finished goods under Sun Xu’s orders.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Why aid a fallen master?”

“Fear,” Jing Boyan replied. “Sun Xu’s remnants still hold sway. But your purge will sever his last threads here.”

**Chapter 2944: Winning Loyalty**

Guan Yu studied the names. “Tomorrow, we uproot this corruption. Your vigilance ensures this factory’s future—and yours.”

Jing Boyan’s grime-caked face cracked a sly smile. The unkempt exterior, Guan Yu realized, was masterful camouflage—this man’s sharp mind had survived Sun Xu’s fall by playing the fool. Now, realigned with fresh purpose, he’d become an invaluable pawn in dismantling Bill Lin’s schemes.
