The tone was grand and imposing, as if money truly meant nothing, but in reality? A moment of impulsiveness, rashly throwing in such a sum, and now sensing the tides turning—regret had set in? Too late...

A greenhorn who’d beamed with joy after winning twenty or thirty thousand now faced losing over three million in winnings plus his own principal of several hundred thousand. His guts must be twisting with remorse, his heart bleeding agony. Thinking this, the bosses who’d lost money suddenly felt their moods lift.

Exhaling softly, Guan Yu smirked, tilted his head to glance at the bosses, and stammered, “Seems... I’m a bit nervous! The last three cards—should I call or fold?”

“Fold and save yourself a few grand. Enough for you and your buddies to live comfortably for months. Why gamble until you’re stripped bare? Young man, knowing when to quit is wisdom!” The white-shirted boss advised mockingly, his words laced with sarcasm.

“All in! Threw in millions already—what’s another hundred fifty grand? Call!” Guan Yu slammed a card onto the table.

*Snap!* The card hit the edge, bounced, and flipped over.

No one noticed—or cared—that it was the Five of Clubs. At this critical juncture, who would fret over a single flipped card? A peek at one or two meant nothing.

“That... wasn’t on purpose.” Guan Yu scratched his brow, forcing a sheepish grin.

“No matter...”

“Wait! It’s exposed. Shouldn’t this round be voided?” Guan Yu suggested awkwardly.

“What did you say?!” The gold-chain-wearing man’s eyes bulged, venom in his glare. He couldn’t believe Guan Yu’s audacity to renege over such a triviality.

“I didn’t mean—”

“You think flashing one useless card lets you back out? Who the hell do you think you’re playing with? You motherf—”

“Easy! Just a suggestion. If you don’t mind, forget it!” Guan Yu waved hurriedly, feigning timidity with an ingratiating smile.

To onlookers, Guan Yu was a doomed man moments from ruin...

“Call fifty grand! What’ll it be? Still in?” The gold-chain man’s eyes gleamed crimson, greed palpable as he urged Guan Yu, practically salivating.

The epitome of a gambling addict...

“Call! Fifty grand’s chump change!” Guan Yu swallowed hard, drew a card, and slapped it down.

*Snap!* The Two of Hearts!

Without glancing at it, Guan Yu panted nervously, eyes locked on his opponent.

“Huh?” Liu Er frowned, side-eyeing Guan Yu before silently tossing in another fifty grand.

No matter—he still held two Twos. Even with the Hearts Two exposed, he could swap the spare for the Diamonds Two. His hands rubbed together, mimicking tension, as the Diamonds Two slipped silently into his left sleeve. The prepped Hearts Two, now useless, remained wedged in his right cuff.

“Final fifty grand—showdown! I’m all in!” Guan Yu tossed his cards aside, rolled up his sleeves, and declared coolly.

“Showdown? Heh...” Liu Er smirked, picking up his three cards with practiced flair. Just as his thumb twitched to swap in the Diamonds Two, Guan Yu’s eyes flashed. A surge of Gravity Technique pinned Liu Er’s arm mid-motion, foiling the cheat.

The Diamonds Two stayed trapped in the sleeve.

“Show your cards! Nervous? It’s just millions. I’ll go first!” Guan Yu snatched his cards and slammed them down.

Two Fours and the Diamonds Two...

“A pair? Just Fours?!” The bosses gaped, then snorted derisively. This idiot had sunk four million on such a weak hand? Was he insane?

Behind him, Du Xiaojuan’s grip on Guan Yu’s shirt tightened, her palms sweaty, cheeks flushed, eyes wide as she stared at the opponent’s cards.

**Chapter 167: Stripped Down to Their Waists**

“Reveal them! I’ve got Fours!” Guan Yu trembled visibly, accepting a cigarette from Luo Cheng. His gulps and shaky hands radiated tension.

Yet the gold-chain boss and Liu Er sat frozen, faces ashen, staring wordlessly. Their escape route—the two remaining Twos—had been exposed, one in Guan Yu’s hand, the other flipped earlier. Their backup plan was dead.

Liu Er had spent minutes rigging his sleeves, cycling through a deck via armpit triggers, memorizing each shuffle. The Hearts Two’s exposure should’ve let him swap in the Diamonds Two seamlessly. But now, with both Twos revealed, altering to a straight was impossible. Sleeves already held two cards—adding more would risk exposure.

A lifetime of cheating undone by absurd coincidence...

“Show your cards!” Guan Yu exhaled smoke, pressing.

“I...” Liu Er croaked, voice rasping like a broken gong.

“You win. We’ve got two Twos.” The gold-chain boss interjected coolly, tossing Liu Er’s cards down. Two Twos versus two Fours—a four-million folly. The crowd buzzed with disbelief.

Bao Si smirked inwardly. *Even the slyest fox gets outfoxed.*

“We won?! We won!” Guan Yu slapped his thigh, laughing uproariously. “Told you my luck’s red-hot! These Fours are golden! Pack it up!” He gestured to Luo Cheng and Niu Le, stuffing four briefcases with cash.

The bosses watched, hollow-eyed, as Guan Yu hauled away nearly a million. The victor’s glee masked the room’s dawning suspicion—had he orchestrated this? The exposed card, the timely interference... Yet without proof, they could only seethe.

**Chapter 168: Winning a Big Company**

“Another round? Just us—shirts off!” The gold-chain boss growled, stripping his shirt to reveal pallid flab. Guan Yu followed suit, handing his shirt to Du Xiaojuan.

Bare-chested, they faced off with a fresh deck.

“Your move,” Guan Yu said.

The man glared, chain glinting like a dog’s collar. “I’m low on cash. Let’s bet big.”

“How?”

“Two companies—worth thirty and twenty million. Each hand’s a million. Win enough, they’re yours.”

Guan Yu’s probing gaze confirmed the firms’ legitimacy—a construction giant and a coal transport empire. Nodding, he agreed.

Using his Gravity Technique subtly, Guan Yu let the man win sporadically, masking his edge. Hours passed, smoke thickening the air as the boss sweated through fifty million in losses.

“Construction company’s yours. Papers’ll be drawn.” The man gritted, dignity clinging to ruin.

Guan Yu blinked, stunned. Through his探查术 (Insight Technique), he’d known the stakes—but the reality of owning a empire left him speechless.

The crowd watched, torn between awe and pity. A lifetime’s work, gambled away in moments. Yet rules were rules. Tonight, Guan Yu walked away a king.
