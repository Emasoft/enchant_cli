Noticing the lottery booth owner’s astonished gaze, Guan Yu grinned. “I’m buying a lot!”

The owner quickly nodded in understanding, sliding open the cabinet door and pulling out the stack of tickets Guan Yu had pointed to.

Activating his Probing Technique again, Guan Yu swiftly filtered through the upper layers of tickets.

Ah, there! He locked onto his target.

“This one! Check how much, boss.” Guan Yu handed over the chosen stack and began counting cash.

After paying over eighty yuan for the thick bundle and pocketing his change, he returned to a nearby table and sat down.

Scraping the tickets rapidly with a coin, he already knew which held prizes before revealing the hidden areas.

Minutes later, Guan Yu returned to the counter clutching a stack of winning tickets.

“Hit the jackpot! Take a look… 1,040 yuan.” He smiled, passing the tickets over.

“A thousand? You won?” The owner exclaimed, verifying each ticket before竖起大拇指. “Impressive luck, young man! Exactly 1,040 yuan!” He collected the tickets and counted out cash from his drawer.

“Buying more?” The owner asked cheerfully.

Though another thousand yuan entered his pocket, Guan Yu felt unsatisfied—it was still too little.

“Is this all the tickets? Any left?”

“What, planning to buy them all?” The owner chuckled.

Guan Yu took a drag of his cigarette. “If there’s more, I’ll try my luck again.”

With a laugh, the owner waved. “Wait here.” He bent down and retrieved six unopened bundles from beneath the counter.

“These are 100-yuan bundles, those are 500. Take your pick!”

Hearing of the win, onlookers—mostly migrant workers—crowded around.

“How much did he get?”

“Which prize tier?”

Their envious chatter buzzed like cicadas. After all, this was free money fallen from the sky!

As the owner chatted with the crowd, Guan Yu activated his Probing Technique to scan the new tickets.

“Alright, testing fate again—this 500-yuan bundle.” He slapped five crisp bills onto the counter.

“Such decisiveness!” The owner beamed, swiftly exchanging cash for tickets.

**Chapter 69: Absorption of Candy**

Another win sent the entire booth into uproar. Five thousand yuan from a 500-yuan investment—even the owner turned green with envy.

Tucking away his earnings, Guan Yu patted his bulging wallet and left contentedly.

After scouting nearby booths, he decided to venture farther for bigger catches. Staying in one area risked suspicion if multiple wins coincided. Though harmless, unwanted attention could bring trouble. Best to avoid it.

Waiting at a bus stop, he rode six stops before disembarking near a shopping mall.

Merging into the bustling crowd, he slipped into another lottery booth.

Repeated use of his Probing Technique drained him. Just as he neared the end of scanning, sudden vertigo struck.

He barely caught himself against the counter, trembling violently as cold sweat drenched him. His limbs turned leaden.

Gasping, he deactivated the skill. The dizziness eased slightly.

Wiping his forehead, he staggered out and collapsed on a curb, head buried in arms as he fought to recover.

_What’s happening? Energy depletion?_ Panic surged. Since gaining his abilities, only Gravity Manipulation and Healing required brief cooldowns. Probing and Summoning had felt limitless—until now.

_Thank gods this didn’t happen mid-fight. I’d be dead meat._

Horror chilled him. Was earning petty cash worth risking his life?

_I need a hospital. Now._ He forced himself upright, flagging a taxi.

“Hospital… please,” he wheezed, slumping into the backseat.

“You alright, kid?” The driver glanced worriedly.

“Just… unwell.”

At the hospital, he lurched through admissions alone.

“Where’s your family?” A doctor asked while steadying him.

“I’m a college student here… no family nearby.”

“No friends either?”

“Freshman.” Guan Yu smiled weakly.

Loneliness bit deeper. _How nice it’d be to have someone care._

Test results soon arrived. The doctor frowned. “You need immediate hospitalization. Severely hypoglycemic—dangerously low blood sugar. We’ll start IV glucose and adjust your diet. Malnutrition from hardship?”

_Blood sugar?_ Guan Yu blinked.

After paying for treatment, he lay in the infusion room, watching droplets fall. As glucose flowed, strength returned miraculously.

Sitting up, he flexed energized limbs. _Was that weakness just a bad dream?_

Discharged with orders to consume more sugar, he bought a bag of lollipops. Crunching one, heat surged through his jaws—the candy dissolved instantly, warmth spreading through his core.

_What the—?_ He devoured ten more until the heat subsided.

_So the copper coin’s power feeds on my body’s sugar! I’ll need candy and chocolate on hand always._

Revitalized, his money-making urge reignited. He found another lottery booth nearby.

**Chapter 70: One Hundred Percent Sincerity**

Emerging twenty minutes later with 2,000 yuan, Guan Yu marveled at his speed. _If I did this all day, I’d be rolling in cash!_

But he dismissed the idea. Compared to his antiques expertise and healing skills, lotteries were small fry. _Curing a rich man’s illness could make me millions overnight!_

Depositing 12,000 yuan into a new bank account, he reminisced about backbreaking dock work for 2,000 a month. Now, he’d earned six times that in hours.

As he pondered visiting his new martial arts master, his phone rang—Feng Xin.

“Yes, Sister Xin?” He answered politely. This fiery woman held the key to learning from her grandfather—he couldn’t afford to upset her.

“Where are you? Come for lunch. We need to talk.”

He hailed a taxi to her luxury hotel. The opulent lobby brimmed with luxury cars. _Why spend thousands on meals when people starve?_ He shook his head.

In a private dining room, Feng Xin sipped tea coldly. “Grandfather bathed with you yesterday?”

“Y-yes…”

She sighed. “Ignore his nonsense. He’s old and delusional about marrying me off.”

“But I’m serious!” Guan Yu leaned forward. “I’ll protect you faithfully!”

“What?!” Her eyes flashed.

“I mean it! I’ll obey every order, guard you with my life!”

“You…” She glared, then relented. “Fine. Do as you wish.”

He hid a triumphant smile. Yesterday he’d resisted being her bodyguard—now he’d fight to keep the role for her grandfather’s teachings.

Studying her across the table, he admitted her beauty beneath the stern demeanor. Her peach-blossom cheeks begged to be bitten.
