Guan Yu silently recited the cultivation technique he had just studied, attempting to draw spiritual energy from the heavens and earth. After several attempts, however, he discovered the results were far from ideal. Each effort yielded only minuscule amounts of qi, frustrating him deeply.

“It seems that to achieve decent results, one still has to put in some effort!” Guan Yu sighed.

After learning from previous failures, he began anew. Regulating his breathing into steady rhythms, he gradually absorbed wisps of ambient spiritual energy. Within moments, his lungs brimmed with accumulated qi. Sensing the approaching saturation point, a smile crept across his face.

His earlier failures stemmed from impatience—greedily grasping for too much energy at once. Martial arts strictly forbade such recklessness; one couldn’t become obese from a single bite.

As Guan Yu opened a stone cavern revealing traces of ancient humans, Song Yue’er sent word about collaborating on a related thesis the next day.

Unexpectedly intercepted by Song Yue’er near a glass coffin, alarms blared as security swarmed the scene. Stunned, Guan Yu watched Li Tian, consumed by rage, draw a dagger and lunge again. Guan Yu desperately grabbed the blade while Song Yue’er’s blood sprayed onto a mummy. A blinding white light engulfed them—then came the disorientation of crossing worlds.

Awakening to find primitive tribesmen scrutinizing him, Guan Yu struggled until wolf howls scattered his captors. Armed with the dagger, he fought the pack but sustained a wolf bite. As despair loomed, a female savage appeared, spearing a wolf with her javelin before guiding him to a cave.

Inside, she applied medicinal herbs to his bleeding arm. Daily, she hunted with her javelin while Guan Yu marveled at her survival skills—like friction-fire ignition. His modern lighter once reignited flames, startling her. Though he admired her prowess, his helplessness shamed him as a man.

A month into this alien world, hatred for Li Tian festered. Were it not for that betrayal, he’d never have nearly died here. Song Yue’er’s motives perplexed him—if she conspired with Li Tian, why aid him? Guilt, perhaps?

Occasionally, he sneaked glances at her photos on his power-conserved phone. Just as recovery promised usefulness, the savage woman vanished without warning.

Now alone but equipped with primitive skills and modern wit, Guan Yu resolved to carve his destiny here. Mastering torch and dagger, he hunted small game—often failing and starving. During one expedition, he encountered the hostile man from the sacrificial ritual.

Saving the group from beasts earned Guan Yu no gratitude, only hostility. As he turned to leave, an elder stopped him, inviting him to their tribe.

Correcting his earlier mistakes, Guan Yu resumed slowly gathering spiritual energy. Once saturated, he channeled the qi toward his dantian.

“Sink qi to the dantian, condense energy into swords, strike the core!” he roared. The accumulated qi began sluggishly migrating toward his lower abdomen.

Soon, the movement halted. Opening his eyes, Guan Yu muttered, “As the texts warned—guiding qi to impact the dantian is this technique’s greatest trial. Enduring excruciating meridian ruptures while maintaining laser focus on the energy’s path… A moment’s distraction spells failure. More suffering awaits.”

Resuming, he directed the qi through meridians. Agony twisted his features instantly, yet he pressed onward relentlessly.

After three torturous hours, one meridian pathway unlocked. Collapsing onto his bed, drenched in sweat and breath shallow, Guan Yu rasped, “Damned agony! And this was the smallest meridian! If unblocking them all doesn’t kill me, it’ll leave me crippled!”

Despite complaints, triumph glowed within him. This minor victory enabled the next cultivation phase—the remaining channels could wait.

Resting briefly, he resumed qi absorption. With the new meridian open, he embarked on the final step of the Turtle Breathing Technique: transforming qi into a sea.

Inhaling deeply, Guan Yu guided fresh qi through the cleared pathway. Sensing the energy’s gradual convergence, he smiled.

Though challenging, this phase proved easier than meridian breakthrough. When the first qi threads reached his dantian, Guan Yu performed esoteric hand seals and chanted, “Heavenly energies heed my command—enter the dantian, become the sea!”

The pioneer qi strand spiraled toward his core, subsequent energies whirling around it. As the vortex expanded to fill his dantian, Guan Yu shouted, “Condense!”

The swirling energies compressed toward the vortex’s heart. Guan Yu exhaled in relief as a miniature, slowly rotating qi sea materialized. Though modest, it signified monumental progress.

“All greatness starts small,” he murmured, wiping sweat before succumbing to exhaustion.

At dawn, Guan Yu raced to the mountain peak. With his nascent qi sea, he could now practice the Fist Force technique. Eagerness propelled him upward.

Studying the manual, realization struck: “Fist Force integrates bodily strength with qi—greater energy reserves amplify punch power. The Turtle Breathing Technique’s foundation makes sense now!”

Though crude at first, Guan Yu’s repetitions gradually flowed smoother. From distant trees, a shadowy figure smiled approvingly—the boy showed promise.

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, his father Guan Xiao observed briefly before departing.

“My strikes still lack power,” Guan Yu mused after multiple drills. “I must expand the qi sea.”

“Brother Guan Yu! Look how they admire you!” Huo Lingling’s playful voice interrupted.

“Past flattery pleased me, but no longer,” he replied, patting her head.

Nearby disciples glared enviously as the clan’s jewel flirted with Guan Yu. Among them, Hu Xiaohai—self-proclaimed genius and suitor—seethed.

“That waste hoards all fortune!” Hu muttered. “Just wait—I’ll reclaim what’s mine!”

**Chapter 1483: Spiritual Energy**

Returning home, Guan Yu contemplated the remaining five meridians. That night, chanting absorption mantras, he marveled at swirling qi vortices—a testament to his growing dantian.

Guiding the torrent through channels, sweat beaded his brow despite accelerated progress. After thirty minutes, another meridian yielded. Without pause, he funneled qi into his dantian, the qi sea churning violently as it expanded.

Vortex formation marked success, but Guan Yu pushed harder—the whirlpool’s growth demanded relentless focus. Modern determination merged with ancient cultivation, forging a path through pain toward transcendence.
