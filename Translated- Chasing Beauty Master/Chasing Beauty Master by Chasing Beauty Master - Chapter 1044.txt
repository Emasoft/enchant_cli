The leather factory was vast, resembling a self-contained residential compound. Most of the employee dormitories here housed Sun Xu's loyal subordinates – the concentrated force he had built over years.

After last night's incident, those who had brawled at Qiaoyuan District's entrance remained unaware their headquarters had been ransacked. The less severely injured who didn't require hospitalization returned to find production completely halted.

Originally employing nearly three hundred workers – over half being Sun Xu's men – the compound now stood eerily quiet. Ordinary workers had left after production ceased, while lightly injured men retreated to dormitories, leaving the grounds nearly deserted.

The sprawling factory complex neighbored a residential area where vendors operated various shops selling daily necessities. When Wei Hongwei arrived with his men, they found the gates wide open and unmanned. Vehicles roared into the central courtyard – a space as large as school grounds.

Wang Hu approached Wei Hongwei as the group disembarked. “Everyone remaining here must be Sun Xu's loyalists. Drive them out and secure this place. After obtaining production permits, this will be ours.”

Nodding, Wei Hongwei pointed at dormitory buildings. “Search every room! Bring everyone out! Tell them new management’s taking over!”

**Chapter 2669: I’ll Only Say This Once**

Wang Hu barked orders: “Move faster! Don’t let anyone escape! Gather everyone here immediately!”

Yu Gang members armed with weapons stormed the buildings, herding people to the courtyard. After over an hour, two dormitories stood emptied. Sweating subordinates reported to Wei Hongwei: “Hall Master, we’ve gathered most here. Some areas still need checking.”

Waving dismissively, Wei Hongwei said, “This suffices. Let’s finish quickly in this heat.”

Wang Hu shouted: “Listen carefully! I’ll only explain this once!”

Nearly two hundred people stood in the courtyard – about a hundred Yu Gang members and several dozen confused Sun Xu loyalists. Since yesterday’s destruction and injuries, their vanished leader left them directionless.

Wei Hongwei’s voice boomed: “Your boss is finished! Yu Gang now controls this territory. Though enemies, we show mercy today. Take this chance!”

Shocked murmurs rippled through Sun Xu’s men. Their secret skirmishes against Yu Gang had backfired spectacularly.

A Yu Gang member whispered to Wei Hongwei: “Hall Master, let’s humiliate them properly. They’ve harassed us endlessly.”

After hearing the plan, Wei Hongwei spread his legs and laughed as his subordinate announced: “Our magnanimous Hall Master offers redemption! Crawl through his legs to renounce Sun Xu, and walk free. Refuse, and face consequences!”

With their leader missing and factory destroyed, Sun Xu’s men began complying. The first crawled through amidst laughter. “Smart man! You’re free!” Wei Hongwei declared.

As the line grew, Wang Hu opened another “gate” with his legs, speeding the process. Within minutes, every Sun Xu loyalist had crawled through.

“Pathetic loyalty,” Wei Hongwei sneered. “Not one stayed true.”

Wang Hu ordered: “Take your belongings and leave! Everything else belongs to Yu Gang!”

Surprisingly, thirty men approached. “Hall Master,” one said, “We wish to join Yu Gang.”

Wei Hongwei hesitated but called Guan Yu. “Boss, should we accept Sun Xu’s former men?”

Guan Yu’s laughter crackled through the phone. “Take them! They’ll ease our takeover and train new workers. Keep them confined to factory duties for now.”

Returning, Wei Hongwei announced sternly: “Our leader initially refused, but I pleaded your case! We’ll temporarily accept you to work here – a merciful second chance!”

Tearful gratitude followed. An elderly man stepped forward – Factory Director Gu, Sun Xu’s former right-hand. “We thank you for this lifeline,” he said, bowing.

Appointing Gu as retained director, Wei Hongwei ordered: “First, register all recruits. Second, give my assistant a full facility tour.”

As reorganization commenced, Sun Xu and Ge Ying lay unconscious from blood loss in the Feng residence. Meanwhile, Young Master Feng berated Bill Lynn in the east hall: “Your stupid provocation cost me 50 million! Guan Yu nearly slaughtered us!”

Bill Lynn dismissed the complaints. “Sacrifices were necessary to test Guan Yu’s defenses. Your cowardice disappoints me.”

When Feng threatened to flee north, Bill Lynn coldly replied: “Abandon ship now, and the Bill family abandons you.”

Forced into compliance, Feng swallowed his anger as Bill Lynn plotted his next move – eyes fixed on the upcoming auction and its legendary treasure map.

**Chapter 2671: Two Fools**

The confrontation laid bare their fragile alliance. Bill Lynn’s schemes dangled Feng between survival and destruction, while Wei Hongwei’s successful takeover marked Yu Gang’s expanding dominance – all under Guan Yu’s calculating gaze.
