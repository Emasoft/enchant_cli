Elder Qing tentatively attacked the black hole with her spiritual power, but the vortex-like void directly absorbed her energy before spewing it back. Guanyu violently coughed blood before collapsing unconscious.

Xuanming and other elders panicked, rushing to check Guanyu's condition. Detecting faint breath, Xuanming urgently commanded, "Continue maintaining the ritual! Ensure the other three complete their Merit Bestowal undisturbed!"

Supporting Guanyu's body, Xuanming prepared healing techniques. Elder Qing sat before the youth, her hands glowing—the first time she'd personally intervened for a junior disciple. Something about this boy intrigued her profoundly.

As both elders channeled energy into Guanyu, the seven-colored radiance from the Merit Cauldron continued pouring into his mind despite his unconscious state. Elder Qing's brow furrowed. "Xuanming! What is this cerebral void? How could you not detect such an abnormality earlier?"

"It's a seal," Xuanming admitted shamefully. "It locks away his cultivation and memories. I never imagined it would interfere with the ritual... I wouldn't have risked this otherwise."

"Centuries of experience yet such recklessness!" Elder Qing rebuked. "Were this promising seedling to perish through your negligence..."

Xuanming's guilt deepened. Guanyu was his most valued disciple—this catastrophe defied all expectations.

"The Merit Cauldron wars against the seal," Elder Qing observed. "We must assist its purge, but cautiously. A misstep could shatter his consciousness."

Nodding solemnly, Xuanming focused protective energy around Guanyu's mental meridians. The pulsating void devoured their spiritual probes like hungry quicksand, repurposing their own power against them.

"Reinforce his primary neural channels," Elder Qing instructed. "I'll coordinate with the Cauldron's assault." But the ancient artifact's rainbow brilliance, though diminishing the void's size, gradually dimmed as energies depleted.

Meanwhile, the other disciples completed their enlightenment. Xiao Zhi sprang up exultant: "Alchemical formulas! The Cauldron gifted me pill-refining secrets!" His joy faded upon seeing Guanyu's bloodied form. "What befell him? Assassins?"

"Silence!" Chief Zheng hushed. "His soul battles within. We can only wait."

As days passed, Siqi tended to Guanyu's motionless body under Elder Qing's directives. "Stimulate his limbs," the elder instructed. "Though his body perishes, his mind still fights."

Within Guanyu's consciousness, tsunami-like clashes between the Cauldron's light and void's darkness raged. Fractured memories emerged from the weakening seal—glimpses of forgotten lives and sealed powers. His dantian became battleground for resurgent internal energy and spiritual forces, neither yielding dominance.

"Three days without awakening..." Elder Qing sighed on her fourth inspection. "The window narrows."

Tears streaked Siqi's cheeks as she massaged Guanyu's unresponsive hands. "Why must fate torment the worthy?"

"Blame Xuanming's oversight," the elder snorted. "Yet this boy's vitality astonishes. Ordinary men would've perished yesterday." Her gaze softened. "The struggle is now his alone. Whether he chooses to return..."

As midnight approached, Siqi jolted when Guanyu's pulse vanished. Before her scream formed, Elder Qing materialized bedside. "His bodily functions cease, but mental sparks remain. Maintain circulation—there's still hope."

Unbeknownst to them, within the crumbling void, coalescing energies birthed a nascent equilibrium. Guanyu's fragmented self-awareness grasped at escaping memories, each recollection fortifying his resolve. The Cauldron's dying light fused with his spiritual essence, forging pathways through besieged meridians.

"Persist," whispered ancestral voices from dissolving shadows. "The dual cultivation path awaits..."

**Chapter 3330: Unconsciousness**

Though tormented by warring energies, Guanyu clung to the Cauldron's final lesson—spiritual cultivation was key to conquering the seal. As internal energy and spiritual power reached tentative truce in his dantian, awareness began its arduous climb from abyssal depths.

Siqi started when the corpse-cold fingers she held twitched. Across three sleepless nights, the first sign of life.
