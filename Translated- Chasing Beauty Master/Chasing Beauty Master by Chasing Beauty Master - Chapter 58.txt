After exchanging a few words with Madam Luo, Guan Yu directly flipped back the quilt and pressed his palm against her lower abdomen. While casually conversing with her, he activated his healing technique. The ancient coin immediately emitted a stream of healing energy that swiftly transmitted through his palm to begin treatment.

Seven or eight seconds later, Guan Yu suddenly felt that familiar draining sensation again. His heart clenched as he hastily stopped the treatment. Even after absorbing seven or eight bags of white sugar, he still hadn't completed twenty percent of the healing process.

Damn it... If this were a terminal cancer patient or someone with tumors, wouldn't I need to absorb sugar by the ton?

If only I could sit next to a sugar pile—absorbing energy with one hand while channeling treatment with the other—maintaining perfect balance between supply and output. Then perhaps... there might be hope to complete a full healing session. But realistically, Guan Yu couldn't risk revealing his bizarre ability to anyone. This ideal scenario remained utterly impossible!

Sighing deeply, Guan Yu forced a bitter smile. He'd rushed here eagerly, thinking he could finish the treatment this time. Who knew... the result would be the same!

The only consolation was that Madam Luo clearly looked more vibrant after this session. Healthy pink now tinged her previously pale cheeks, replacing her sickly pallor.

Chapter 139: A Glimmer of Hope

The most stunned observers were the neighboring patients. They'd initially assumed Guan Yu was a charlatan, but after his first visit left Madam Luo able to walk and visibly improved, and now this second treatment bringing even more dramatic changes... The healthy flush on her face seemed nothing short of miraculous!

"Young man, is this... qigong? Are you a qigong master?" A plump woman eagerly scooted closer, beaming with interest.

Guan Yu glanced at her and nodded slowly. "You could say that. It's a method to strengthen the body and treat certain ailments—in theory." He kept his tone casual, avoiding grandiose claims about curing all diseases.

Despite his modesty, the other patients' eyes shone with fervent hope as they stared at him.

"Little brother, could you examine me? I've had two small blisters on my lungs for over half a year. They don't hurt, but the hospital insists on keeping me here without diagnosis..."

Guan Yu pursed his lips and immediately shook his head. "I'm afraid not. Each treatment exhausts me terribly." The idea was laughable—Madam Luo alone kept him busy enough. Did they think absorbing sugar was easy? With all the sneaking around required, when would he find time to treat others?

He'd already decided: aside from close acquaintances, anyone seeking his healing must offer substantial compensation. Without proper incentive, he wouldn't lift a finger.

"Brother, truly... thank you." Luo Cheng accompanied Guan Yu to the ward door, his gratitude tinged with embarrassment.

"Don't mention it. I'll return tonight if possible. I'll do everything to heal Madam Luo quickly." Guan Yu spoke solemnly. This served both as personal experimentation and genuine desire to help.

The Luo brothers now knew about the toxic substances their mother had expelled after treatment, cementing their faith in Guan Yu's abilities.

As they prepared to leave, the door swung open. A stern-faced middle-aged doctor in his forties marched in, nearly colliding with Guan Yu.

"You're still here?" The doctor glared distrustfully.

Shrugging, Guan Yu stepped aside with a smile.

"Luo Xiufen—your medical fees are almost depleted. Today's IVs will be the last. Family members must pay downstairs. Nurses will administer the drips shortly." The doctor announced coldly toward the bed.

Madam Luo hesitated, glancing at Guan Yu. Her sons likewise sought his opinion—unsure if hospital treatment might conflict with his methods.

"Continue the standard care. Let me know if funds run low. Madam Luo, I'll take my leave." Guan Yu ignored the doctor's hostile stare and exited calmly.

The doctor snorted inwardly. What a successful fraud! Aloud, he lectured: "You common folk distrust science? Modern medicine is advanced, yet you believe these charlatans! If he could cure you, why come to hospitals..."

The Luo family endured his tirade in awkward silence.

Returning to campus by taxi, Guan Yu bought another large sugar bag and headed to his dorm. Though his first school days had been consumed by earning money and treating Madam Luo, he felt fulfilled helping such kind people.

Back in his room, he resumed sugar absorption to recharge the coin. When roommates Niu Le and Wang Zhen returned at four to find him "napping," they exchanged amused glances.

"Guan Yu! Living the dream, eh? Skipping half the morning and entire afternoon classes? You're unstoppable!" Wang Zhen slapped Guan Yu's thigh jokingly.

"Had business outside." Guan Yu sat up, shrugging.

"Clearly out-slacking us pros! We should learn from you!"

As they bantered, Tian Hao interjected: "Forget hitting on classmates. Class Monitor Bi's already swarming those girls. Wait till they're bored—maybe you'll get leftovers?"

"Bullshit! I'll show you! Give me a week—I'll conquer that ponytailed girl!" Wang Zhen thumped his leg dramatically.

Guan Yu listened blankly—he'd barely registered classmates during his brief classroom appearances. But mention of girls reminded him—he still needed to contact Du Xiaojuan!

His phone vibrated. "Sis?" He answered cautiously, abbreviating "Shi Lei-jie" to avoid revealing his relationship with their teacher.

Chapter 140: The Window

In the faculty dorm, Guan Yu climbed the stairs, buoyed by Liu Shilei's dinner invitation. Her tender phone voice had warmed him.

Reaching her second-floor door, he froze—Mo Ling alone inside, washing vegetables.

"Come in. Shilei's shopping." She glanced up.

"What's the occasion?"

"Rewarding your hard work." Mo Ling smirked—clearly briefed about his "earnings."

Before Guan Yu could explain his charitable efforts, she gestured: "Help me—water's cut off."

He blinked. Fetch water from the women's restroom during peak hours? Impossible!

"The maintenance valve was left closed. Can you climb up and open it?" She led him to a corridor pipe three meters high—no ladder in sight.

Guan Yu surveyed the spot. Activating gravity-defying jumps here would risk exposure. "Can I step on the wall?"

Mo Ling shrugged. "Just do it."

As she left for a stool, Guan Yu seized the empty corridor. With a running start, he scaled the wall like a spider—grabbing the pipe's valve window.

Peering through grimy glass, he froze—a woman inside the restroom, adjusting her clothes below!

Thud! His forehead hit the window.

"Peeping Tom!!" Screams erupted.

Panicking, Guan Yu dropped down—but too late. Five furious teachers swarmed out, dragging him back.

"Explain yourself!" The pink-clad victim hissed, face pale with rage.

"Wait! I was fixing the valve! Mo Ling can—"

The chemistry teacher sauntered over. "What's happening?"

"Mo-jiao shi, tell them! You asked me to—"

"What does this have to do with me?" Her innocent blink chilled his blood.
