After more than twenty alpha wolves encircled Guan Yu and his companions, the largest wolf—likely the pack leader—raised its head and let out another piercing howl.

At this moment, Guan Yu suddenly noticed something amiss. These wolves weren’t preparing to charge. Instead, each stood rigidly with its tail raised high, glowing faintly at the tip.

“What’s going on here?” Guan Yu muttered curiously.

Wang Xiaorong, seated at the edge of the tent, immediately understood. She urgently warned, “Guan Yu, these are cultivated wolves! They’re preparing to cast a collective spell to attack us. The circle formation means they’re coordinating their magic. Stop them now—target the alpha first!”

These wolves had clearly cultivated for years, though their skill levels varied. The brightness of the light at their tails reflected their strength: dimmer glows indicated weaker cultivation, while brighter ones signaled greater power.

Wang Xiaorong urged Guan Yu to strike the alpha before the wolves completed their spell. Without hesitation, Guan Yu unleashed a Dou Qi Slash from his Soulfall Blade. The radiant arc, over a meter long, shot toward the alpha. But just as it neared its target, the attack collided with an invisible barrier and dissipated like a stone sinking into the sea.

“What’s happening?” Guan Yu exclaimed.

Qiqi, observing keenly, cried out, “They’ve encased us in a semicircular shield! Your attack hit the barrier, not the wolves!”

“A transparent shield? How are we supposed to fight this?” Guan Yu growled, frustration mounting.

The pack, now fully focused, began channeling their spell. Above, beams of light from their tails converged into a single point in the sky. Wang Xiaorong swiftly cast her strongest protective spell on Guan Yu, cloaking him in a dark, smoke-like armor.

A golden bolt of lightning erupted from the coalesced light, crashing onto Guan Yu’s head with a deafening roar. Dazed, he staggered but quickly recovered, thanks to Wang Xiaorong’s shield. As another bolt gathered, Guan Yu dodged, the lightning cratering the ground where he’d stood.

Realizing the shield’s persistence, Guan Yu furiously hacked at the barrier with his Soulfall Blade. Yet the wolves’ spell proved cunning—lightning strikes curved mid-air, forcing him into constant motion. Finally, with a resonant *crack*, his blade shattered the barrier. He lunged at the alpha, their clash erupting into a whirlwind of speed and steel.

Meanwhile, the remaining wolves turned their attention to Wang Xiaorong and the others. Qiqi brandished her Fairy Sword, its edge gleaming. “Stay back!” she declared, slicing off a wolf’s paw as it lunged. “This blade cleaves iron like mud. Try me!”

“Qiqi, you’re amazing!” Duan Ruxue praised, though fear tinged her voice.

Flushed with pride, Qiqi faltered momentarily, nearly caught off-guard by a flanking wolf. Wang Xiaorong’s crossbow bolt pierced the beast’s eye, allowing Qiqi to finish it with a swift decapitation. Blood splattered her clothes, jolting her back to vigilance.

Across the battlefield, Guan Yu struggled against the alpha’s preternatural speed and iron-hard hide. His relentless strikes finally carved a bloody groove into its back. Seizing the moment, he channeled lightning through his blade, driving the crackling energy deep into the wound. The alpha howled, retreating with its haunches singed and trembling.

As the pack leader faltered, Guan Yu pressed his advantage, each strike honed to exploit the weakening fissure in its defenses. The alpha’s retaliatory pounce met only air, its once-ferocious eyes now wide with pain and fury.

While Guan Yu dueled the alpha, Qiqi stood guard, her Fairy Sword a silver blur. “No one’s getting past me!” she vowed, her confidence buoyed by Jiang Yuankai’s praise. Yet her momentary pride nearly cost her when a wolf ambushed from the side. Wang Xiaorong’s timely crossbow shot saved her, the bolt laced with corrosive venom.

“Stay sharp, Qiqi!” Jiang Yuankai cautioned. “These beasts are cunning.”

Qiqi nodded, chastened. “No more mistakes.”

Guan Yu, meanwhile, analyzed the alpha’s movements. Its hide repelled his blade, but repeated strikes to the same spot finally breached its defenses. Infusing his weapon with lightning, he electrocuted the beast from within, forcing it into retreat.

Exhausted but triumphant, Guan Yu turned to aid his allies. Qiqi’s blade flashed, deterring the pack, while Wang Xiaorong’s shield held firm. The wolves, their leader crippled and morale broken, began to scatter.

“Next time,” Guan Yu muttered, wiping sweat from his brow, “don’t underestimate humans.”
