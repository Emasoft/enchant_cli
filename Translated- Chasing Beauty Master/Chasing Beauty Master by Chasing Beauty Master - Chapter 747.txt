“Younger Uncle, I’ve seen that foreigner often at the Flower Night Club. Why is he here too?” Zhang Han directly asked Han Qiao.

Han Qiao stood not far away and had also noticed Zhang Han. Of course he knew her—nearly everyone in City A who frequented the Flower Night Club recognized Zhang Han as Yang Conghan’s niece, as she often visited the club with her aunt.

Han Qiao understood that Zhang Han was an even more troublesome force of nature. If Wei Shengjin had harassed her instead that noon, lying in a hospital bed now would be considered merciful, just as Guan Yu had said. Otherwise, given Zhang Han’s infamous temper—the deadliest in the entire universe—Wei Shengjin would likely be permanently “asleep” in the morgue.

Han Qiao barked at his subordinates, “Stop gawking! Want a trip to the hospital?” His men, eyes bulging like Yang Jing’s, had been staring greedily at the beauties beside Guan Yu. Only after Han Qiao’s sharp rebuke did they snap back to reality.

Watching his subordinates’ disgraceful behavior, Han Qiao sighed. “Let’s go. Utterly embarrassing.” Clueless, the men trailed behind him as he left.

Guan Yu chuckled inwardly. *Thank goodness it was Han Qiao who showed up. Otherwise, tonight’s dinner would’ve been ruined.*

Amid cheerful banter, Zhang Han and Lan Yu shared amusing stories from their afternoon at the amusement park, while Amei sat quietly, barely touching her food. Guilt gnawed at her for cutting short the others’ fun.

Guan Yu shook his head imperceptibly. He couldn’t control Amei’s thoughts—her kindness was simply too profound.

The spicy hotpot dinner, laden with fiery duck intestines and necks Han had ordered, proved too much for Amei’s mild palate. Though Guan Yu specially ordered her a non-spicy vegetable hotpot, she barely ate a few bites before claiming fullness.

Exhausted from the day’s adventures, the group retired to their hotel. After Guan Yu shooed them away, Zhang Han and Lan Yu—now inseparable—pouted their way back to the adjacent room.

Alone with Amei, Guan Yu broke the tension. “Amei, let’s bathe together.” Her meek assent was barely audible.

In the mist-filled bathroom, water cascading around them, Guan Yu jested, “You ate so little today. Let’s replenish your nutrients.” Guiding her head downward, he initiated an intimate remedy.

Dawn found Guan Yu awake first. Amei still slept, her cheeks flushed. Planting a gentle kiss, he recoiled at her feverish skin. Panic struck—last night’s vigorous “exercise” had left her drenched and vulnerable. Channeling his internal energy through her meridians, he stabilized her temperature within minutes, leaving residual energy that could awaken her latent cultivation potential.

**Chapter 1895: Arriving as a Group**

Though indifferent to tournament outcomes, Guan Yu prioritized Amei’s recovery. Even after draining his energy reserves, he’d make the same choice without hesitation.

At the hotel entrance, Chen Tianxiao greeted them. “Enjoy yesterday’s outing?”

“Amusement park all afternoon. You?” Guan Yu countered.

“Got plastered with buddies and slept till midnight,” Chen admitted, drawing laughter.

When asked about tournament rules, Chen shrugged. “They’re keeping it secret until arrival—prevents teams from exploiting weaknesses.”

Nodding approval, Guan Yu drove his beauties behind the school bus.

**Chapter 1896: Draw Duels**

At Shanhai Stadium, Guan Yu spotted Wei Hongwei. “All your ladies are here safely,” Wei panted. “With Sister Yang and Sister Jing guarding them, who’d dare cause trouble?”

Surveying the crowd, Guan Yu noted most spectators were cultivators—Westerners included. This unprecedented gathering defied his expectations of cultivation’s rarity.

Approaching Yang Conghan’s group, Zhang Han immediately tattled: “Auntie! Younger Uncle bullied me!”

Yang’s momentary panic (had Guan Yu deflowered her teenage niece?) dissolved upon hearing the complaint: “He wouldn’t let me sleep with him!”

“I’ll discipline him later,” Yang soothed, relieved Guan Yu’s integrity remained intact.

Guan Yu countered, “No more snacks if you keep slandering me!”

“Then I’ll sleep with you tonight!” Zhang Han bargained, oblivious to the stares their stunning entourage attracted.

Forcing masks on his harem, Guan Yu acquiesced to her demands—partly tempted by the spitfire’s allure, partly to quiet her.

At the competition area, Principal Zhang Taiping (the unchanged predator Guan Yu now recognized) briefed them. The draw pitted Kaihuang Academy against Century Garden—their strongest rivals.

Chen Tianxiao warned: “Their ace Cao Jin surpasses Upper Three Venerables realm. Ge Yinglai’s at Upper Three Venerables too. We’re outmatched unless tactics save us.”

As Zhang Han obliviously munched shrimp crackers, Guan Yu strategized—matching their weakest against Century’s strongest might salvage victory. Yet with Wang Hu’s mediocre skills and Zhang Han’s unpredictability, the odds remained grim.

“Feng Jiawei’s related to the Feng family you humiliated,” Chen reminded. “Expect retaliation.”
