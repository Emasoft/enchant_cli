“Five years? So how much time has passed now?” Guan Yu asked a crucial question.

You Dun calculated for a moment, seeming uncertain as he replied, “It’s already been five years. If I’m not mistaken, that’s correct. But I never intended for my master to seek me out. Over these five years, I’ve only learned superficial skills from the manual—some basics of poisoning and crafting simple toxins. Beyond that, I’ve mastered nothing.

“Besides, I wasted most of my time fooling around. If my master really comes and sees how little progress I’ve made, she’ll surely expel me from the sect.”

“If she expels you, that’d be for the best,” Jinhua chimed in without hesitation, then quickly added, “But our main goal today is to find your master. We mean no hostility toward either of you.”

Upon hearing this, Dake beamed. “Really? That’s wonderful! Truly wonderful!”

“However,” Guan Yu interjected, “You Dun must stay here and not leave. We’ll wait until your master comes to you. Only then can we meet her.”

Thus, they had no choice but to wait passively with You Dun for his master’s arrival. If his calculations were right, she would visit him the day after tomorrow.

Guan Yu decided to let the two live a little longer. Once they met You Dun’s master, he would report them to the authorities. The immediate challenge was keeping You Dun and Dake under surveillance. With no alternatives, Guan Yu called for reinforcements from home, summoning Gambiri once again.

Fortunately, Gambiri had left some men behind earlier for emergencies. Now, they proved useful. After instructing his subordinates to treat the captives decently—binding them but providing food and drink—Guan Yu explained to You Dun, “This is only to ensure you don’t flee. Finding your master requires this. Bear with it for now.”

Dake, clearly displeased, grumbled, “If you’re after You Dun’s master, why bind me too? I’ve got nothing to do with this! Just let me go!”

“Don’t flatter yourself,” Jinhua snapped. “Release you, and you’ll blab to others or rally help to free him!” Without another word, she stuffed a towel into Dake’s mouth.

After settling matters, Guan Yu and Jinhua set out to find an herbal pharmacy. Locating a traditional Chinese medicine shop in the West proved challenging, but they soon stumbled upon a grand establishment styled after ancient Chinese architecture.

Inside, Jinhua marveled at the exhaustive inventory, including many herbs banned in China. She shopped with glee, filling the car’s trunk to bursting. Some rare and costly ingredients she bought in bulk.

At checkout, Guan Yu winced—the bill exceeded 400,000 RMB. Though unfazed by the cost, he was startled by how pricey certain herbs were. Still, it was worth it to see Jinhua’s childlike joy.

On the drive back, Jinhua popped a dried tofu-like morsel into her mouth and offered one to Guan Yu. “What is this? Rock sugar?” he asked, savoring the sweet, minty coolness that refreshed his senses.

“Just eat it. It won’t kill you,” Jinhua chuckled. Guan Yu, familiar with herbal remedies, trusted her—many such substances were harmless or even beneficial.

They returned home past midnight, hauling bags inside. Second-to-Wolf* growled, “Hurry up! I smell food! Been starving all day—you’re ruthless, Guan Yu!”

**Chapter 2346: Sarcastic Remarks**

Second-to-Wolf complained, “Hurry! I’ve smelled the food forever! Starved me a whole day—you’re heartless!”

Apologizing, Guan Yu watched as Jinhua laid out their midnight snack. “Come eat, everyone! You must be famished!”

“Obviously! I’m too weak to move!” Second-to-Wolf yelled. “A Cai! Food’s here! Let’s eat!”

A Cai, now accustomed to the group, joined without hesitation.

“Did you really not eat all day?” Guan Yu asked. “Why not go out?”

“Easy for you to say!” Second-to-Wolf retorted through mouthfuls. “Who’d guard this place? Me? If killers came, could A Cai handle them? Or send A Cai out? Or that half-dead woman?”

Guan Yu and Jinhua exchanged guilty glances—they’d forgotten to arrange meals.

“Sorry,” Guan Yu said. “Assumed you’d manage. Didn’t think you’d actually starve.”

“Spare the sarcasm!” Second-to-Wolf shot back. “Treating a free bodyguard like this—where’s your conscience? Though… these burgers taste amazing today!”

**Chapter 2347: A Fiery Temper**

After dinner, Guan Yu asked Second-to-Wolf, “Leaving with A Cai tomorrow morning?”

“Yes. The farther from you, the better. Your drama’s endless. I’d leave now if I could!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Scared I’ll rope you in again? Don’t worry—I won’t keep you freeloading here.”

“Once you find Jinhua’s grandmaster in two days, you’ll return to China, right?” Second-to-Wolf asked pointedly.

“Yes. I’ll retrieve Sakurako immediately. Tell her to safeguard the golden dagger.”

Second-to-Wolf nodded, his thoughts heavy.

Noticing his melancholy, Guan Yu pressed, “You have much to do—reach First-Class Superior Rank, find your child. Don’t you believe he’s alive?”

Second-to-Wolf’s fists clenched, flames flickering around them. “Even if we met, we wouldn’t recognize each other. I just hope he’s happy… that’s enough.”

“If he were mine,” Guan Yu said firmly, “I’d scour the earth to find him. He deserves a father’s protection.”

Second-to-Wolf stared silently, conflicted.

“Are you so quick to give up?” Guan Yu pushed. “What if he’s suffering, crying for help? Wouldn’t that haunt you?”

Second-to-Wolf’s fist suddenly blazed, striking a tree that collapsed with a thunderous crack.

“Hey!” Guan Yu joked. “That’s my tree! Pay up!”

“Pay? After working for free? You owe *me*!” Second-to-Wolf laughed.

Later, as they drank, Second-to-Wolf sighed, “I envy you. All your women obey so well.”

“They get along,” Guan Yu said. “Compromise when needed.”

“Sakurako’s temper nearly leveled my house once. Like an earthquake!”

Jinhua, returning with snacks, huffed, “I’m his woman, not a servant! Always ordering me around!”

Guan Yu grinned. “They’re all strong-willed… but it works.”
