“Yes, time truly flies. That child suffered greatly back then. If not for Sect Leader’s intervention, he might have been reduced to bones long ago,” Elder Lu added.

Elder Jiu chuckled, “Xiaodong is obedient, honest, and kind-hearted. Since his arrival, our lives here have become more leisurely. At least I no longer need to wash my own clothes—hahaha!”

The group laughed along. Guanyu found Elder Jiu rather amiable now, unlike his stern demeanor earlier. At least the elder could crack jokes.

Guanyu couldn’t help asking, “Is Xiaodong the one we just saw? He’s not a disciple of Cloud Azure Sect? Why is he here with Elder Jiu? Was he punished for wrongdoing too?”

Elder Lu coughed sharply at Guanyu’s slip of tongue. “Ahem! Elder Jiu, Guanyu is still young. Please don’t take his words to heart.”

Only then did Guanyu realize his mistake—implying Xiaodong was confined here as punishment indirectly labeled Elder Jiu a wrongdoer. It was like rubbing salt in old wounds.

**Chapter 3136: The Deaf-Mute**

Guanyu hurriedly apologized, “Elder Jiu, please forgive my thoughtless words. I meant no offense.” Apologies were necessary—not only was the elder his senior, but they also needed his help today. Offending him would ruin their plans.

Elder Jiu waved dismissively with a smile. “No matter. I’ve never regretted my past mistakes, so I’ve no fear of others mentioning them.”

Guanyu mused inwardly, *“Elder Jiu must have loved that demonic sect enchantress deeply. Who’d have thought this old man was such a romantic? After all these years, he still pines for her. I wonder how breathtaking that demoness must have been.”*

“Ah, Xiaodong was always a sensible child. I once considered taking him as my disciple,” Elder Lu sighed. “But his deafness and muteness posed difficulties. Living among sect brothers would’ve invited bullying. Thus, I sent him here instead.”

Guanyu asked curiously, “Was Xiaodong born deaf and mute? He doesn’t seem so.”

Xuanming nodded. “Indeed, he wasn’t. North of our Cloud Azure Mountain lies a small village—merely a few dozen households. Years ago, the demonic sect’s Poison Mist Faction bred venomous creatures there to frame our sect. The entire village perished from infection. By the time I arrived, Xiaodong was the sole survivor. Though I purged his toxins, the poison’s severity left him deaf and mute.”

“How vile!” Guanyu exclaimed. “That Poison Mist Faction deserves divine retribution! Slaughtering a whole village—such cruelty!”

Elder Jiu calmly countered, “We must judge fairly. While many in the demonic sect commit atrocities, not all are evil. They’re human too. We shouldn’t condemn an entire group for individuals’ crimes.”

Elder Lu and Xuanming exchanged glances, nodding slightly. Guanyu held his tongue, sensing the delicate atmosphere.

Guanyu observed how Elder Jiu openly defended the demonic sect. Since ancient times, orthodox and demonic factions stood opposed across an unbridgeable chasm. Righteous sects exterminated demons, while the latter retaliated with bloodshed—an endless cycle.

Elder Jiu’s stance stemmed from knowing his beloved demoness had been innocent, unjustly hunted by righteous forces.

Xiaodong served tea and withdrew. Guanyu diligently refilled the elders’ cups.

After sipping his tea, Elder Jiu asked, “State your business. Why visit me today?”

Xuanming cut to the chase. “Two matters, Elder Jiu. First, we seek your insight into the seal in Guanyu’s mind. Can it be broken?”

“A seal? Poison requires antidotes—I’ve none here,” Elder Jiu puzzled.

“Not poison,” Xuanming clarified. “A demonic seal traps his memories and cultivation. Outwardly, he appears a Jiezun master, but currently, he’s merely ordinary.”

“Remarkable!” Elder Jiu seized Guanyu’s wrist, probing his meridians. “This seal resembles a bottomless abyss! It could devour not just Jiezun cultivation but even a deity’s power! Who cast this?”

Guanyu shook his head. “I’ve forgotten everything before the seal. Its existence was discovered later.”

As Elder Jiu pondered, Elder Lu inquired, “Can you break it?”

“Impossible,” Elder Jiu declared. “Were it elsewhere, I might attempt it. But in the brain? One misstep could kill him. Too perilous.” Turning to Guanyu, he asked, “So you’re ordinary now?”

“Yes,” Guanyu nodded.

“I see,” Elder Jiu mused. “This seal drains all cultivation. Any internal energy produced gets absorbed. Thus, you seek to cultivate magic instead. But danger remains—if the seal breaks later, your unleashed energy and nascent magical reserves might fuse... or explode. Without proper energy channels, you’d die horribly.”

Guanyu nodded. “I understand the risks. But life thrives on challenges. Even if I explode someday, I’ll regret nothing.”

“Stubbornness mirrors Elder Jiu’s youth!” Elder Lu chuckled.

Elder Jiu sighed. “I admire your courage, boy, but why gamble? If you regain Jiezun power, you’ll command universal respect. Why risk magic?”

**Chapter 3137: Troubles**

Guanyu had considered this. But breaking the seal required a Jiezun Relic—near impossible. Hence, his desperate alternative.

“I’ve heard only a Jiezun Relic or demonic royalty can undo this seal—likely cast by their imperial line.”

“A Jiezun Relic? Heavens!” Elder Jiu exclaimed. “Only Jiezun masters develop such relics—crystallized dantians. As cultivation progresses, internal energy transforms: gaseous→liquid→gel→solid. Only at Jiezun stage does it petrify into an indestructible core. This relic stores immense power, making Jiezun masters nigh invincible. Obtaining one? More likely to pluck stars!”

Guanyu nodded. “Knowing its rarity, I abandoned hope until fate led me here. Hence, my decision to learn magic.”

Elder Lu frowned. “If Jiezun masters have relics, why don’t you?”

“Mine was sealed away,” Guanyu explained.

“Wait!” Elder Lu interjected. “They say Jiezun Relics resurrect the dead. True?”

Elder Jiu and Xuanming shook their heads uncertainly. “Legends claim so, but none living have witnessed it,” Elder Jiu admitted.

“It’s true,” Guanyu stated, stunning everyone.

Xuanming pressed, “How can you be certain?”

“I used one to save a life.”

“WHAT?” Elder Lu nearly choked. “You—you sacrificed a Jiezun Relic for someone? A lover? Where’d you even get it?”

Guanyu smiled wryly. “Though my memories are sealed, acquaintances told me I slew a demonic Jiezun beast in battle—the same conflict where I was sealed.”

“You fought a demonic being?” Elder Jiu marveled. “Centuries ago, demons invaded our realm. Their might overwhelmed humanity until gods sealed their portals. Stragglers likely remain hidden, fearing exposure.”

Xuanming asked, “Where did you encounter this demon?”

Guanyu shook his head. “My memories begin post-sealing. My companions forbid discussing the past.”

Elder Lu exclaimed, “Defeating a demonic Jiezun! You’re legendary! How’d you cultivate so young?”

Xuanming chided, “Junior Brother, he can’t remember. Don’t badger him.”

Guanyu added, “My associates shield me from past traumas. Perhaps ignorance is kinder.”

Elder Jiu pressed gravely, “Who did you save with the relic? Such treasures equate to second lives!”

Guanyu sighed. “A clan patriarch lay dying. His daughter implored me—offering anything if I saved him. So I…”

**Chapter 3138: Escalating Impropriety**

Elder Lu exploded before Guanyu finished. “Fool! Seduced by some chit? Throw away a Jiezun Relic for skirts? Women abound! Was your brain addled?”

“AHEM!” Elder Jiu coughed pointedly. “Mind your language, Junior Nephew!”

Unrepentant, Elder Lu grumbled, “Idiot boy! I’d never squander such treasure for flirtation!”

Xuanming and Elder Jiu exchanged exasperated looks.

“The relic was Guanyu’s to spend,” Xuanming reasoned. “What’s done cannot be undone.”

Elder Jiu sighed. “Why save another over yourself?”

“Duh!” Elder Lu interjected. “Smitten by beauty! Youth’s eternal folly!”

Guanyu explained, “I didn’t know about my seal then. The relic’s value was unclear—saving a life seemed noble. I acted impulsively.”

“Noble? Pah!” Elder Lu ranted. “Some pretty face bats eyelashes, and you’d hand over your soul! Pathetic!”

“JUNIOR BROTHER LU!” Elder Jiu thundered. “Compose yourself! Must you always be so brash?”

Yet Elder Lu continued muttering about wasted opportunities and feminine wiles, oblivious to decorum.
