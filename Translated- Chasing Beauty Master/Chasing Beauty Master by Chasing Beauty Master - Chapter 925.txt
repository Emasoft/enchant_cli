After harboring their respective thoughts, the two soon heard the sound growing increasingly distinct.

Jiang Shan hurriedly said to Ji Qian, “Qian’er, hide quickly. Remember—no matter what happens here, do not come out. Understand?”

Upon hearing this order, Ji Qian’s face betrayed reluctance.

Jiang Shan’s expression darkened. “Did you hear me clearly?”

Resigned, Ji Qian nodded and swiftly left Jiang Shan’s side, retreating to hide among nearby ruins.

Meanwhile, the muffled noise grew thunderous, closing in on Jiang Shan.

Steadying his breath, Jiang Shan looked up and soon spotted a creature approaching. Though not large in size, it radiated immense energy.

Shaking the treasure in his hand, Jiang Shan hesitated before tucking it into his robe.

By the time he finished preparing, the sacred beast stood less than ten meters away.

Under faint firelight, Jiang Shan finally saw its form: twin tusks, glossy black mane, and eyes glowing eerie green. It resembled a boar but was far larger.

Jiang Shan steadied himself, activating his energy waves to brace for battle.

The beast eyed him briefly before charging without hesitation, hooves pounding the earth.

Dodging its ferocious assault, Jiang Shan leapt nimbly onto a cypress tree to observe.

When the beast missed its target, it scraped its tusks against the ground and charged again, snapping the sturdy tree in half.

Jiang Shan’s eyes widened in alarm, realizing the creature’s brute strength. No longer underestimating it, he channeled his dantian energy, merging it with his energy waves. A violet halo bloomed between his palms.

As the beast charged once more, he hurled the halo with all his might.

To his shock, the beast halted and absorbed the attack unharmed.

Jiang Shan’s heart trembled. Such a strike would have killed a lesser beast or human. Yet this creature treated his energy as mere nourishment.

What now?

Pondering his next move, Jiang Shan leapt to another tree, aiming to inspect the beast’s hide.

The beast reared upright like a human, thwarting his attempt. Jiang Shan swiftly retreated to a pine branch.

Lowering its forelegs, the beast stared at him with a mix of menace and absurd charm.

At an impasse, Jiang Shan watched warily.

Seizing his hesitation, the beast attacked relentlessly, forcing Jiang Shan into desperate evasion.

When the beast finally paused, panting, Jiang Shan landed on a pine to assess it.

Suddenly, the treasure in his robe blazed brilliantly, leaping forth to bathe the beast’s forehead in light.

A miracle unfolded: the beast docilely shrank to rabbit size.

“Incredible! I’ve never seen such a thing!” Jiang Shan murmured, awestruck yet cautious.

Fear dissolved, he leapt down, intending to strike—but paused.

“Could this be a spirit beast?” he wondered aloud, confirming its identity.

Regret flooded him. “Had I known earlier, I’d never have let the treasure diminish it!”

Spirit beasts harbored coveted spiritual energy, harvestable only in their prime. Diminished, they became ordinary.

Noticing the floating Moonlight Mirror—the beast’s bane and protector—Jiang Shan’s eyes lit with recognition before confusion clouded them.

Soon, the shrunken beast fled. Retrieving the mirror, Jiang Shan prepared to rejoin Ji Qian—but collapsed mid-leap, an unseen force dragging him earthward.

“What’s happening?” he cried, summoning Ji Qian.

She arrived to find him pale and weakened. After hearing his account, she gasped, “The mirror has drained your residual spiritual energy!”

“What?!” Disbelief contorted his features.

Ji Qian insisted, “Give me the mirror.”

Too feeble to comply, Jiang Shan whispered, “Take it yourself...”

Her fears confirmed, she warned, “Without intervention, your vitality may fracture, leaving you weaker than mortals.”

Stunned, Jiang Shan pleaded, “Can you reverse this?”

Ji Qian shook her head. “The mirror only absorbs. You must regain your energy anew. Besides, that borrowed power was never truly yours.”

“But its loss is devastating!” he protested.

Silent, she returned the mirror.

“Dispose of it!” he rasped.

Ji Qian chuckled. “Seal its ends with energy to isolate it. Then it’s harmless.”

Jiang Shan sighed bitterly. “Enough. Let’s leave this accursed place.”

**Chapter 4,367: Gentle Ji Qian**

At his rare show of fear, worry flickered across Ji Qian’s face.

“It’s not you who should fear,” Jiang Shan murmured, gazing at distant stars. “My heart is unsteady.”

A chill wind swept through broken windows as Jiang Shan’s pallor worsened, his vitality sapped.

Ji Qian watched helplessly until Jiang Shan’s forehead grew feverish.

“I’ll recover with rest,” he assured her weakly, though his decline was evident.

Determined, Ji Qian offered, “Let me gather herbs.”

“You don’t know what’s needed,” he demurred.

“But this can’t continue!”

As they lapsed into silence, birdcalls echoed outside. Ji Qian shuddered—then heard Jiang Shan mutter, “Silver fir leaves...”

Her spirits lifted. “Will they heal you?”

He nodded faintly. “My master claimed they cure all ailments.”

Braving the predawn forest, Ji Qian navigated thick undergrowth until finding the distinctive white-barked tree with mottled leaves.

By noon, she returned with leaves to find Jiang Shan near death.

Following his instructions, she prepared a decoction—only to realize they lacked ingredients.

Jiang Shan gestured weakly to a packet in his robe containing the missing herbs.

As Ji Qian brewed the remedy, hope flickered—but Jiang Shan’s fate hung in balance.
