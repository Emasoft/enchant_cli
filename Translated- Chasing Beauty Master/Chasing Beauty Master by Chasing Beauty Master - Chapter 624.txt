“Why save me!” Ling Tian was utterly perplexed. He had never met her before—why would she rescue him? At that moment, Guan Yu slowly opened her eyes, revealing a bone-chilling coldness in her gaze. Though it vanished in an instant, she stared impassively at Ling Tian, her voice devoid of emotion. “One life in exchange for absolute loyalty. A fair trade.”

Ling Tian immediately grasped her meaning. “You’re so certain I’ll obey you?” His eyes brimmed with disdain. No one in this world had ever made him submit completely. Little did he know that very person now stood before him. “I will help you reclaim everything.” Ling Tian froze. “How do you know about that?!”

Guan Yu glanced at him coldly, her gaze sharp enough to pierce through souls. “We are the same—kindred spirits.” Ling Tian murmured, “Kindred spirits?” As if resolving himself, he abruptly knelt on one knee before her. “Master!”

Observing his gesture, Guan Yu’s lips curved into a faint smile. “From this day forth, you no longer exist. Ling Tian is dead. Henceforth, your name shall be—Jue (Utter End)!” Ling Tian stiffened. *Jue?* A bitter laugh escaped him. Yes, he was already dead. From today, Ling Tian would vanish from this world, leaving only Jue!

He couldn’t explain why he felt compelled to trust this girl younger than himself, yet he harbored no regrets. He *believed* she would help him reclaim everything! Seeing Jue’s determination, Guan Yu nodded approvingly. “Now, tell me your story.”

Jue gritted his teeth, voice icy. “I am the new master of the Bloodshed Pavilion. But…” As he recounted his past, Guan Yu listened without a flicker of emotion, as though hearing the most mundane tale. Yet deep within, her simmering resentment began to unravel, threatening to erupt.

Jue had ascended as the Bloodshed Pavilion’s leader, only to be undermined by his lack of strength. His rivals seized power, reducing him to a puppet. Now deemed expendable, they sought his life—yet Guan Yu intervened.

“Good,” Guan Yu said coldly. “I will help you reclaim your birthright—but not with my own hands. What’s yours must be taken by *you*.” Jue nodded fiercely, watching her resolute figure. *Yes. I’ll make them surrender everything they stole. Are you prepared, Akali?*

Guan Yu turned, her tone casual. “How many supporters remain loyal to you?” Jue frowned. “Master, are you planning to…?” Following her gaze into the distance, she replied, “We shall establish a new faction.” Jue’s eyes widened—*rebuild from ashes?*

But comprehension soon dawned. In this realm, power alone wasn’t enough—influence reigned supreme. “Understood, Master!” Guan Yu nodded, relieved by his quick wit. “Lead the way.” As she vanished, a thought echoed: *Akali… my surprise approaches.*

Mid-flight, Guan Yu halted abruptly. Something felt amiss. *What did I forget?* Before she could ponder, Jue stumbled into view, panting. She suddenly recalled: only wind-attuned adepts could fly before reaching Celestial Venerable rank. *How careless of me!*

Offering an apologetic smile, she said, “My mistake.” Yet Jue remained lost in thought. *Wasn’t she a wood-attuned adept? Since when did she command wind?*

“Master… you wield multiple elements?” Though Jue had guessed, hearing confirmation stunned him. Guan Yu’s slight nod left him speechless.

A twelve-year-old Celestial Venerable. A polymath adept. Either fact alone defied belief. *Our master is a true monster,* Jue inwardly marveled, solidifying his resolve. Noticing his awe, Guan Yu sighed. *Am I truly so fearsome?* Grabbing his arm, she soared into the distance.

In a dim hall, an aged man in green robes listened grimly to his subordinate’s report. “Pavilion Master… the assassination failed.” The elder slammed his chair. “Failed?!” He’d deployed nearly all his Celestial Venerables—yet they perished entirely.

“None survived,” the kneeling man added. The elder trembled with rage—half the Bloodshed Pavilion’s strength, obliterated! But then: “However… Ling Tian that whelp is dead.” The elder exhaled in relief. Though costly, eliminating that thorn was worth the sacrifice!

Guan Yu frowned at the derelict shack before them. “We came here… to recruit?” Jue gestured reassurance. “Wait here, Master.” A sharp whistle pierced the air—a dozen shadows materialized. Jue turned to Guan Yu. “Your orders, Master.”

The assassins gaped. Their leader addressing a child as master? Had he gone mad?

The lead black-clad man pulled Jue aside. “Have you lost your mind? She’s just a girl!” Before Jue could explain, Guan Yu’s voice cut through: “All present? Excellent.” A four-star Celestial Venerable’s magic array flared beneath her feet.

The group froze in shock—a twelve-year-old Celestial Venerable?! Guan Yu’s next words shattered their stupor: “By the Pavilion Master’s decree, you traitors shall perish!”

Chaos erupted. The black-clad man rounded on Jue. “Ling Tian! Explain!” Jue could only endure the accusations silently. *Master… you’ve truly trapped me.*

“Attack!” Guan Yu commanded. Confusion reigned—until several assassins suddenly turned on their comrades, weapons gleaming. The lead traitor sneered, “Survival favors the pragmatic.”

As the loyalists moved to retaliate, Jue restrained them. Guan Yu observed their conflict, a predatory smile forming. When the dust settled, ten remained steadfast against her.

“Submit… or die.” The loyalists knelt as one. “We pledge our lives to you, Master!” Guan Yu’s smile widened. These twelve would become her first elite force—the Asura’s Talons.

“From this day,” she declared, “we rise supreme!” Their echoed vow—“Supreme under heaven!”—would later mark the birth of legends.

**Chapter 1587: The Brothel**

Dawn found them fleeing the shack. Passing through desolate Dingyuan Town, Guan Yu ignored the famine-stricken streets—until a commotion arose. A child clutching a bun was beaten by ravenous townsfolk. A scream pierced the air—the child stabbed an attacker, then fled toward Jue. “Save my sister! Please!”

Jue moved to shove the beggar aside, but Guan Yu stayed him. “Why should I help you?”
