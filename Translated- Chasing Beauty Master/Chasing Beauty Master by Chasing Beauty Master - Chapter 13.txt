“Brother, if you’re going to say that, I have to lecture you a bit! No matter how you judge things—whether as a smartass or a dumbass—you’ve got to respect facts! Look at this figure, this physique... How could they possibly match that ‘ass’ label? Quit spouting nonsense from now on. Since it’s your first offense, I’ll let it slide!” With a forced chuckle, he dragged his luggage inside and headed to his bunk.

“Don’t mind him—he speaks without thinking...” Guan Yu whispered apologetically to Wang Zhen with a low laugh.

“It’s fine... I don’t care!” Wang Zhen waved his hand dismissively, casting a sidelong glance at Niu Le.

Seemingly aware he’d misspoken, Niu Le rubbed his nose awkwardly and fell silent.

The four roommates chatted in the dorm, though Wang Zhen soon busied himself arranging his bedding before retreating into his laptop, offering only occasional half-hearted replies. Clearly, the topics discussed by Guan Yu and the others held little interest for him.

“Let me tell you—our university in Nanjing has the highest ratio of beauties among all colleges! Plenty of tycoons and rich businessmen come here to keep mistresses. Our school has even produced big-name celebrities—film stars and...”

“Absolutely true! According to surveys, women make up sixty-five percent of students in our university district. Half of them are moderately attractive, seven percent are stunning, four percent could topple cities with their looks, and about half a percent are downright nation-wreckers! For sheer beauty density, no other art institute compares!” Wang Zhen suddenly pivoted as if injected with adrenaline, launching into a statistical tirade that left Guan Yu marveling at his preparedness.

“But these women... while pretty, their character and intelligence are questionable. They say big breasts mean small brains. Finding a talented, virtuous beauty here who’s both smart and gorgeous? Nearly impossible. Even if they exist, they’re not for the likes of us.” Wang Zhen sighed dejectedly.

Guan Yu nodded vigorously. “Did you research all this beforehand?”

“Of course! Why else would I come? My goal is to cultivate such magnetic charm that beauties will weep and fight to embrace me. But you three...” Wang Zhen smirked, eyeing his roommates. “Reaching my level might prove challenging.”

The assessment wasn’t unfounded. Niu Le’s hulking simplicity might only appeal to deeply insecure women. Tian Hao, resembling a plump field mouse with squashed features, would deter any girl not fond of pets. As for Guan Yu—average at best—he paled next to Wang Zhen’s striking looks.

“Don’t worry,” Wang Zhen declared grandly. “When my charm peaks, I’ll assign each of you several beauties! No more lonely nights with your right hand!”

When blank stares met his crudeness, Guan Yu changed tack: “Let’s celebrate enrollment! My treat.”

“No—I’m local. My family runs a restaurant. Dinner’s on me!” Tian Hao insisted, chest-thumping.

After brief debate, they set out. Campus streets teemed with comely students. Wang Zhen gaped like a country bumpkin, muttering appreciations: “That waist... so slender!” “Perfect legs—just right for shouldering...”

“Have some dignity!” Guan Yu hissed. “Stop eyeing them like starving wolves.”

“You don’t understand,” Wang Zhen retorted. “My obvious admiration is the highest compliment. They pretend disdain, but inwardly bask in honeyed delight. It’s about charisma—I’ll teach you later.”

At Tian’s family eatery, tensions erupted when local thugs tried dining without payment. After violent confrontation left the bullies bloodied and kneeling outside, the students resumed their meal.

Mid-feast, Guan Yu received a call from Feng Xin—his martial arts mentor. Arriving in a Mercedes, the icy beauty stunned the group by declaring herself Guan Yu’s girlfriend.

Later, when reinforcements arrived for the humiliated thugs, Feng Xin’s mere presence dissolved the threat. “Whoever troubles this restaurant answers to me,” she stated, her underworld authority silencing the crowd.

As evening fell, Feng Xin whisked Guan Yu to a high-society gathering. Amidst politicians and gang leaders, tensions simmered. When a smug young heir eyed Feng Xin, Guan Yu’s protective instincts flared—but for now, the storm remained quiet, the night’s challenges merely brewing.
