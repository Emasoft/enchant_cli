After turning a corner, Guan Yu indeed spotted the twenty-four-hour restaurant Feng Xihu had mentioned. The two entered and settled in a quiet corner.

“So what’s the progress on this case now?” Guan Yu asked casually.

Feng Xihu replied calmly, “It’s proceeding smoothly, though some complications remain. That’s actually why I asked to meet you today.”

“Makes sense. This human trafficking ring is massive—handling it must pose difficulties. Do you need my help with something?”

“No. The truth is, I’m urging you to leave immediately. You’ve stirred up serious trouble. This organization isn’t as simple as you think—they have deeper networks behind them. While we’ve pulled out one of their poisonous fangs, they won’t let you go. You need to find a safe place to hide for now.”

As she spoke, genuine concern etched Feng Xihu’s features. Only when Guan Yu saw this expression did his suspicions ease—he’d half-expected her to be Chen Xiaona in disguise.

“I appreciate the worry, but ordinary threats can’t touch me,” Guan Yu said dismissively.

“I know your capabilities, but this is different. Beyond the escaped members, I’ve learned this group has deep ties with local Western authorities. Returning to Huaxia would be safer—your influence there offers protection.”

Feng Xihu’s voice grew urgent yet hushed, her eyes darting around nervously.

“So even here, corruption runs this deep? I thought it was only our side. If their local connections are this strong, relocation does seem wise,” Guan Yu mused.

“For now, you’re safe. The only one who clearly remembered your face—Karas—is dead. Others barely glimpsed you during the raid. Since you retreated quickly, they likely won’t trace you soon. Use this time to leave.”

Guan Yu considered heeding her advice—avoiding trouble was prudent. Yet unfinished business anchored him here; leaving now would feel shameful.

“Alright. I’ll depart in two days. Hopefully, that’s enough to wrap things up,” he said after hesitation.

“What’s so urgent? Can I assist?”

Her question sparked an idea—police resources could expedite his search. “I came here for a friend. Years of poisoning have brought him to death’s door. I’m seeking Jinhua’s master—only their intervention might save him. Do you know the master’s name or distinguishing features?”

“Given your recent caseload, are your precincts too overwhelmed to help? Also, what became of the rescued victims?”

Warmth softened Feng Xihu’s expression. “Several have been reunited with families. Others... it’s complicated. Some remember their homes; others, broken by torture, recall neither names nor origins. We’re seeking higher authorities’ aid for them.”

“And the traffickers? Don’t tell me connected ones were released?” Guan Yu eyed her skeptically.

Their late-night snacks arrived via a tall, lean Western server. After placing the dishes, the young man asked with a smile, “Anything else I can assist?”

“Not for now,” Feng Xihu replied in flawless English.

As the server left, his lewd gaze lingered on her chest. Guan Yu found this unsurprising—beautiful women attracted stares—though he noted the youth didn’t dare harass her.

Observing Feng Xihu’s black coffee—unsweetened, as requested—Guan Yu remarked, “Bitter coffee? Acquired taste. Even sweetened, it’s harsh.”

Stirring the dark brew slowly, she murmured, “Recently grown fond of it. Beyond the bitterness lies unique aroma. The sharpness keeps me alert—essential during hectic investigations.”

“It’ll ease with time. Overconsumption harms health. Rest matters more than caffeine,” Guan Yu advised, careful to sound merely concerned.

“Worry about yourself. This organization’s backers exceed our worst fears. If they target you...”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Let them come. Righteousness shields me. These heartless beasts—I’ll show no mercy. My only concern is facing multiple experts with my current sealed cultivation.”

Deliberately baiting curiosity, he added, “Were my Peak Realm Sovereign strength unsealed, numbers wouldn’t matter.”

As predicted, Feng Xihu’s eyes widened. “Peak Realm Sovereign? Sealed? Explain!”

Though skeptical—she envisioned such masters as white-bearded elders—Guan Yu continued: “Yes. Now reduced to Second-Class Sovereign, my cultivation stagnates. Only a Realm Sovereign’s Sacred Relic could break the seal—an artifact rarer than phoenix feathers.”

“But you possessed one! Why use it to save Patriarch Yang instead?”

“I didn’t know about my seal then. His survival affected an entire clan. My life wasn’t at risk—the choice was clear. Yang Conghan’s hand came later, as their gratitude.”

Feng Xihu softened, approving his selflessness. “Still, securing another relic seems impossible. Why sacrifice so much?”

“To help. No deeper reason.” Guan Yu’s answer belied the truth—he’d effectively gained the Yang fortune through Conghan, their sole heiress.

Shifting tactics, Guan Yu probed: “I recall the Yangs sought your family’s Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Domain to save their patriarch. Your brother demanded Conghan in exchange, yes?”

Feng Xihu flushed. The Fengs’ shady dealings shamed her. “Inter-clan affairs hinge on interests. The Demonic Domain symbolizes our heritage—we couldn’t part with it lightly.”

“Had I not intervened, Conghan would’ve entered your household. My apologies for disrupting those plans.”

Her discomfort grew. The Fengs had sought to absorb the Yangs through marriage—a scheme Guan Yu’s arrival thwarted. Now, steering conversation toward the relic, he masked his true aim: intelligence about the Demonic Domain.
