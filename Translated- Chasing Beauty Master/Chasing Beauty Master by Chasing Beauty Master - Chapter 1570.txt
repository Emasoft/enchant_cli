“Leaving tomorrow? So soon?” Xiao Qi pouted unhappily. “If you insist on leaving tomorrow, I won’t teach you the disguise technique. Unless... you stay a few more days to play with me.”

Who would’ve thought Xiao Qi’s childish temper would flare up like this? He even started threatening Guanyu. Not a good look for a kid to pick up such habits.

**Chapter 4071: A Favor Without Conditions**

Guanyu knew the wolf tribe’s children were clever, so he didn’t want to deceive him. “Xiao Qi, I truly have urgent matters to attend. I can’t afford delays here. I know you’re a sensible child. If I ever have time in the future, I promise to come back and play with you for a few days. How does that sound?”

“Fine! I knew you wouldn’t stay to play with me anyway. I’ve gotten used to being bored here.” Xiao Qi’s face turned cold, his displeasure evident. Guanyu asked, “There might not be much to do here, but you could always visit Ha’er City nearby. Plenty of fun things there.”

“You think I don’t want to? You think I’m free here?” Xiao Qi retorted. “Though the Demon Lord made me a hall master overseeing this tavern, he’s really restricting my freedom. I can’t leave Lupin Town, and matters outside aren’t my concern either.”

Guanyu hadn’t expected such rules. It seemed the poor child had been stifled by these absurd restrictions—confined to this place, which might seem pleasant on the surface but was practically a prison.

He wondered whether all overseers at gathering points faced such constraints or if the Demon Lord specifically targeted Xiao Qi. Perhaps the rule existed to ensure hall masters remained present for urgent decisions, avoiding delays if leaders were absent.

“Don’t worry. I keep my promises. I’ll return to play with you when time permits,” Guanyu assured. “But for now, you must help me with something: keep my identity secret. Don’t reveal you’ve seen me here—to anyone. Understood?”

Xiao Qi’s curiosity reignited. “What’s going on? You seem terrified of being recognized—disguised like this. Did you murder someone? Commit arson? Robbery? Or... worse?”

“Stop joking! I’ve done none of those,” Guanyu said irritably. “I need you to send a message via birdmen to the Demon Soul Sect. Tell Wang Xiaorong I’m waiting here and need her to come immediately.”

“That’s it?” Xiao Qi asked skeptically. “Aren’t you hiding your identity? If the少主 learns you’re here, won’t that expose you?”

“Why would it? Just relay the message directly to Xiaorong. Don’t others in the Demon Soul Sect handle confidential messages?” Guanyu countered.

“They do, but leaks lead to executions. Your case is different. If word spreads that Guanyu is in Lupin Town, your entire plan collapses. So no names—find a way to inform Xiaorong secretly.”

After deliberation, Guanyu suggested, “Have a birdman deliver the message directly to her in private. No written records.”

“Impossible,” Xiao Qi refused. “Birdmen relay messages through chain posts. If your message reaches the wrong hands, your identity is compromised.”

Guanyu frowned. “Then find another way—a code only she understands. Tell her ‘The crossbow awaits the少主 here.’ She’ll know it’s me.”

“Crossbow?” Xiao Qi muttered, intrigued. Despite his curiosity, he agreed to help, trusting Guanyu’s bond with Xiaorong.

**Chapter 4072: Not for Children**

After sending the message, Guanyu awaited Xiaorong’s arrival. Xiao Qi estimated the fastest response would come by tomorrow night. Until then, Guanyu pressed Xiao Qi to teach him disguise techniques, recalling Third Head’s mastery of altering appearance and even physique.

“That’s Third Head’s specialty,” Xiao Qi said proudly. “But true transformation requires cultivating a unique spiritual force. It’s not simple.”

“So complicated?” Guanyu sighed. “What if I learn the basics first?”

Xiao Qi smirked. “Call me ‘Master,’ and I’ll teach you the口诀.”

“You’re pushing it, kid!” Guanyu retorted playfully, pulling out the crossbow. “But maybe a trade? Show me the口诀, and I’ll let you play with this.”

Xiao Qi’s eyes lit up. “What is that? Let me see!”

After demonstrating the crossbow’s power by shattering a bowl and embedding a bolt deep into a pillar, Xiao Qi was awestruck. “This thing’s incredible! Teach me how to make it!”

“First, the口诀,” Guanyu insisted.

Reluctantly, Xiao Qi relented, reciting the口诀 fragments he remembered. Though incomplete, Guanyu absorbed every word, determined to master the art.

**Chapter 4073: Childish Temper**

Xiao Qi’s impatience flared as he demanded the crossbow. “Give it to me! I helped you; you owe me!”

“Patience. I’ll make you one later,” Guanyu promised, hiding a smile. For now, he focused on memorizing the口诀, determined to perfect the disguise technique before Xiaorong’s arrival.
