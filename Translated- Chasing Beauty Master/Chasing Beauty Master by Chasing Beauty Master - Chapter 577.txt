“In that case, I won't disturb further. Who else here holds authority?”

“Well, that would be Elder Soro! Though he's rather arrogant and rarely receives visitors!”

“Arrogant, you say? Heh, now I'm even more eager to meet him!”

The silver-armored guard reluctantly conceded, “Very well. I'll take you to his residence, but I can only escort you to the gates. Once inside, you'll proceed alone.”

Guanyu nodded. “Rest assured, I won't cause you trouble. Should he take issue, I'll bear full responsibility.”

With matters settled thus, the guard turned to Harris and others. “You've returned – attend to your duties. After this young hero concludes his business, you may report to Elder Soro. I'll handle other matters.”

As Harris moved to agree, Murphy suddenly declared, “No! I'm going with Brother Guanyu!”

Harris's face darkened. “You brat! I tolerated your antics outside, but you dare act willfully here? Do you think I'll permit this?” He reached to drag Murphy away when Guanyu intervened.

“Harris, Murphy's presence could prove useful. There's much I don't understand about your Huntian Sect. At least he can explain things.”

“But...”

“Enough! As I said, I'll take full responsibility. You won't be implicated.”

Harris sighed ruefully. “It's not fear of implication, but unnecessary complications...”

Murphy beamed with undisguised delight, having developed reliance on Guanyu who promised advanced magic instruction. The trio then proceeded towards Elder Soro's estate under the silver guard's guidance.

Passing through farmlands, they encountered a towering mountain adorned with tiered structures. “Young Hero, observe these dwellings,” the guard gestured. “One hundred and eight residences for our sect's elite.”

“So many experts in Huntian Sect?” Guanyu marveled, unprecedented in his experience.

“Not precisely. We consider Gold-rank guards upward as experts. All senior mages and above reside here.”

“An intriguing privilege, though not without drawbacks.”

“What drawbacks?” The guard leaned in.

“It demoralizes junior disciples. Where do they dwell?”

The guard pointed behind the mountain range. “Young Hero misunderstands. This hierarchy motivates cultivation. We implement challenge protocols – occupants must defend their residences against challengers. Victors retain their dwellings; defeated descend.”

“Quite ingenious!” Guanyu admired, observing the thousand-meter peak divided into eleven tiers. “Why ten layers? What ranks occupy each?”

“Our disciples are classified: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Monarch. The lower two tiers house Silvers, ascending accordingly. The apex reserves for Monarchs – future sect leader candidates.”

“Monarch-ranked disciples exist here?” Guanyu started, knowing Monarchs equated to Archmage status. “Beyond that would be...”

The guard's gaze turned somber. “Once, yes. But that was a year past...”

“Implying significant events occurred then?”

“Certain matters... better understood with time. For now, I cannot elaborate.”

Guanyu refrained from pressing, pointing instead to the lower tiers. “Which is yours?”

The guard indicated a modest hut at the base's corner, cheeks coloring slightly. Guanyu noted their pride in cultivation ranks spoke well of the sect's discipline.

“If disciples dwell here, where reside the elders?”

“Yonder.” The guard directed attention to floral hills beyond, dotted with lavish villas amidst blooming gardens. “Our leadership enjoys considerable comforts.”

Guanyu chuckled dryly. “Your superiors indulge in pastoral luxury indeed.” The guard remained silent, well-acquainted with sect politics.

Approaching Elder Soro's dwelling – a simple timber structure encircled by wildflower hedges – Guanyu frowned. “No guards? Unnervingly tranquil...”

“Our sect's peculiarity,” the guard explained. “True defenses lie outermost. Inner sanctums require none.”

“Yet you tremble before this peace?”

“Not fear... reverence.” The guard's evasive reply hinted at deeper secrets when the wooden door creaked open.

A youth of seventeen emerged, closing the door swiftly. “Divine Wood Attendant,” the guard began, “we seek audience with Elder Soro...”

“The Elder rests,” the youth interjected coldly. “He receives none.”

Guanyu's patience frayed. “Is this Huntian Sect's hospitality? Pretentious posturing and empty mysticism?”

“Your meaning eludes me, but audience remains impossible.”

“What if I force entry? Could you stop me?”

The silver guard paled. Divine Wood Attendants represented the sect leader's authority – magical prodigies of Diamond rank at minimum. Conflict here meant disaster.

“Young Hero! You promised no disturbances!” The guard pleaded as Guanyu advanced.

“Blame rests solely with me,” Guanyu declared to the impassive youth. “You won't punish him.”

“You presume much,” the attendant replied, unperturbed by insults to his station.

Guanyu's palm coalesced azure energy, launching a surreptitious strike at the cabin. The attendant whirled, crystalline shields materializing through murmured incantations.

“Unusual defense!” Guanyu marveled as his attack dissipated harmlessly. The energy rebounded unexpectedly, forcing him to deflect his own strike – an esoteric technique blending redirection and amplification.

Murphy gaped. “Counterflux Spirit Pill effects! That's Archmage-level refinement!”

Guanyu grinned through gritted teeth. “This elixir took years to perfect. Common apothecaries couldn't fathom its making.”

“Why not auction it?” Murphy suggested. “Tesla Auction House pays handsomely for rare concoctions.”

Thus began Guanyu's venture to Tesla's famed emporium, cloak obscuring his features. The vaulted hall buzzed with nobility and sect representatives. Appraising his Second Tier Spirit Pill, an appraiser's eyebrows rose.

“A prodigy alchemist? Rare indeed...” The evaluation complete, Guanyu entered the auction proper, noting Huntian Sect's leader amidst the crowd – portending extraordinary items forthcoming.

As auctioneer Saly roused bids for his pill, Guanyu's attention sharpened. The game deepened...
