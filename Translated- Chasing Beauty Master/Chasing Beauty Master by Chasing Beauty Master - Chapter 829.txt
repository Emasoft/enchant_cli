Wei Hongwei was at a complete loss. Having just shifted the blame onto Jia Bo, Qian Yaoyao now wanted to call Jia Bo to verify his story. If Jia Bo misspoke, it would spell disaster—house arrest, kneeling on a washboard, the whole ordeal.

Forcing a strained smile, Wei Hongwei said, “Heh... Uh, alright, I’ll call him for you.” He dialed Jia Bo’s number, hands trembling.

“Hey, Jia Bo? Yaoyao wants to ask you something. You *must* tell the truth...” Wei emphasized the word “truth,” clinging to the slim hope that Jia Bo would catch his drift.

Jia Bo, however, was still groggy after gaming all night. He played the same online game as Zhang Han and served as Lü Mei’s in-game bodyguard—available at a moment’s notice, 24/7.

“Huh? What’s Yaoyao want?” Jia Bo mumbled. Qian Yaoyao snatched the phone from Wei, cutting him off.

“Jia Bo, it’s Yaoyao. I need you to be honest. Don’t worry—Wei Hongwei won’t hold it against you.” She steadied her voice.

Jia Bo jolted awake, sensing trouble. “Oh, Yaoyao! Ask away. I’ll tell you everything I know.” Internally, he replayed Wei’s earlier warning.

“Straight answer: Did you and Wei Hongwei go to the cafeteria’s upper floor?” Her directness startled him.

“Which time? You’re overthinking! We... never went!” Jia Bo backtracked, realizing mid-sentence how often they’d actually gone.

“Stop lying! Wei already admitted it,” Yaoyao pressed.

Panicking, Wei blurted loudly, “See? I *told* you I didn’t go! Jia Bo dragged me there that time!”

Qian Yaoyao shot him a lethal glare, silencing him.

Catching on, Jia Bo spun a tale: “Yaoyao, it’s my fault. I knew he had a gorgeous girlfriend but still pulled him along. But Wei’s loyal! He said none of the cafeteria girls compare to you. Are you... insecure about your looks?”

Masterstroke. Wei covertly thumbs-upped, ready to kiss Jia Bo for this save.

Blushing at the “gorgeous” praise, Yaoyao’s anger dissolved. “Oh, just curious! Never mind. Bye!”

After hanging up, Jia Bo chuckled on his bed. “Wei Hongwei, you owe me a feast. Now I’ve got leverage.”

**Chapter 3023: Harmony Begets Wealth**

Reinvigorated, Wei puffed up confidently. Convinced she’d misjudged him, Yaoyao softened.

“I believed you all along! Just... making conversation!” She giggled, cheeks pink at the thought of his compliments.

Wei sulked theatrically until Yaoyao pecked his cheek—a rare public display. Stunned, he savored the thrill: she usually only held hands.

“Another one? This barely counts as compensation,” Wei begged, leaning in.

Yaoyao pinched him. “Don’t push it. That was a one-time exception.”

“Unfair! You wronged me!” Wei protested, half-pleading.

“Take the win or lose it,” she snapped, knowing feigned anger was her best defense.

Wei relented, gripping her hand as they resumed walking.

“Why’s Guan Yu’s car here?” Yaoyao asked.

“Feng Xihu hijacked it. He wants help getting it back,” Wei explained.

“Feng Xihu? The Feng heiress? She’s a nightmare! Did Guan Yu provoke her? Or... like her?”

Wei shrugged. “Who’d court a girl who nearly stabbed her dad? He’s got enough admirers.”

“True. Let’s hope he stays clear. That woman’s lethal.”

“Relax! Guan Yu’s unbeatable,” Wei said worshipfully.

Yaoyao mimed stabbing Wei’s chest. “What if she kills him in his sleep?”

Wei shuddered, imagining Yaoyao as the vengeful girlfriend. “Women are terrifying!”

“Exactly. Cross us, and you’re dead,” Yaoyao teased, tracing a blade over his heart.

“You’d... kill me?” Wei squeaked.

“Only if you misbehave. Be good, and I’ll pamper you.”

“I’ll behave!” Wei vowed, eyeing safer romantic prospects.

**Chapter 3024: I Really Want to Kick You**

Next day, Jia Bo cornered Wei. “Treat me to dinner. I saved your hide.”

Wei, expecting extortion, agreed readily—until Jia Bo specified: “The cafeteria’s upper floor. Private room with waitresses.”

Wei bristled. “You beast! Again? Yaoyao will murder me!”

“You promised! They’ve got pastries, beer, *everything*,” Jia Bo argued.

“One slip, and I’m dead! Plus, it’s 1,000 a head!”

Jia Bo smirked. “Forget Yaoyao. Think of No. 12—her sweet moans...”

“I’ll kick you!” Wei growled.

“Your choice: Join me or pay 1,500. My lips stay shut... for now.”

Wei caved. “Fine. But *you* dragged me, and Yaoyao can’t know!”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu drove Pan Taisheng’s pickup, while Pan endured Feng Xihu’s perfume-drenched Porsche, littered with lingerie.

“Swap back! This car reeks!” Pan complained.

“Busy. Deal with it,” Guan Yu lied, enjoying the truck.

That night, Jin Hua called urgently. Guan Yu rushed over with snacks.

“The Demon Clan’s Notes mention unsealing Zhang Han’s powers,” Jin Hua said, snacking.

“How?”

“Boundary Sovereign’s Relic or Ten-Thousand-Year Demon Domain, plus Demon Emperor’s blood.”

“Zhang Han’s of the Demon Emperor’s line. So Feng’s Domain could free him?”

Jin Hua nodded. The race for the artifact began.
