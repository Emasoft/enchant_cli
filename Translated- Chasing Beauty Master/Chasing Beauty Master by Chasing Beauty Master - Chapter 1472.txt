“The Cloud Azure Sect has never been lenient toward Demon Sect spies. Xuan Ming’s fury is entirely justified,” Xiao Zhi remarked. “Is Guan Yu safe? When did he return? Was he not subjected to inspection?”

“He arrived precisely during the disciples’ inspection and underwent scrutiny himself,” Wang Jun replied curiously. “Since Guan Yu isn’t a Demon Sect spy, he had nothing to fear.”

At this, Xiao Zhi exhaled in relief. Had the Eight-Sided Drum Technique within Guan Yu’s body escaped detection? Could the spirit beast scales have malfunctioned? Though uncertain of the reason, he felt reassured knowing Guan Yu had passed inspection unscathed.

Wang Jun added, “I’ve heard another piece of good news besides the exposure of Zuo Kong Peak’s disciples.”

“Out with it already! Must you always dangle suspense?” Xiao Zhi pressed impatiently.

“The news is—Yan Zhao has fled.” Wang Jun explained, “During the inspection at Tiger Head Peak’s courtyard, he feigned a trip to the latrine to evade examination. His betrayal enraged the Sect Master, who publicly denounced him as a traitor and ordered his execution on sight.”

“Splendid!” Xiao Zhi laughed. “So the villain meets his reckoning. Though allowing him to escape interrogation was a grave misstep. That scoundrel’s freedom will breed endless trouble.”

“What trouble need you fear?” Wang Jun countered. “With Elder Lu’s testimony clearing your name, the entire sect knows you were framed. More auspicious still—Elder Zheng has been reinstated.”

“Yan Zhao’s downfall is karmic retribution!” Xiao Zhi spat angrily. “Were it not for that hypocritical wretch, I’d never have been reduced to this state.”

Wang Jun chuckled. “Your anger is understandable, but Xuan Ming’s rage surpasses yours. Witnesses say his face turned ashen as he thundered before the disciples, issuing Jianghu-wide warrants. Imagine the humiliation!”

**Chapter 3,837: Turbulent Times**

“Naturally,” Xiao Zhi mused. “Yan Zhao was the Sect Master’s protégé for decades—a source of pride as the sect’s foremost disciple. To discover this nurtured prodigy was a Demon Sect spy all along... The betrayal must cut deeply.”

In Xuan Ming’s eyes, Yan Zhao had been a cherished son—continuously coddled for his exceptional talents. Who could have foreseen this poisonous bloom in their midst?

“More glad tidings,” Wang Jun smiled. “All my news today is auspicious.”

“Truly? Then speak swiftly!”

“When Guan Yu returned to Tiger Head Peak’s courtyard, he arrived with such audacious swagger that even Elder Xiang clashed words with him. In his fury, Guan Yu challenged the elder to single combat—flaunting such insolence that none dared intervene. Astonishingly, Xuan Ming permitted this as impartial arbiter. Elder Xiang’s provocation was unwarranted—what schemes brew in that cunning mind?”

“Elder Xiang nurses old grudges,” Xiao Zhi observed. “Humiliated when Guan Yu’s Emperor’s Seal nearly killed him, he masks resentment beneath courtesy.”

“True. As a Peak Elder overseeing Zuo Kong Peak for decades, he’s unaccustomed to defiance—let alone being bested by a junior. Guan Yu truly is a troublemaker wherever he goes.”

Xiao Zhi smirked. “‘Troublemaker’ suits him perfectly. In my brief acquaintance, I’ve noted chaos follows his footsteps like loyal hounds.”

“Precisely! Yet he’s no fool—his return has already stirred fresh storms.”

Wang Jun continued, “During their duel, Elder Xiang shamelessly claimed Guan Yu only prevailed through the Emperor’s Seal.”

“Hardly unfounded,” Xiao Zhi conceded. “Guan Yu’s a novice cultivator against a century-old elder. Without that divine artifact, how could he contend?”

“True, yet Elder Xiang whined that Guan Yu abused the seal’s power—claiming its stored techniques from Patriarch Jiu made it an unfair contest.”

“Amusing logic,” Xiao Zhi chuckled. “Though the Emperor’s Seal’s might is undeniable—at Lu Manor, Guan Yu used its magic to floor hundreds of guards singlehandedly. Patriarch Jiu’s imbued power is truly terrifying.”

**Chapter 3,838: High Stakes**

“Hypocrisy!” Wang Jun snorted. “Elder Xiang complains of unfairness, yet ignores the inherent imbalance between a novice and century-old cultivator. Where’s the justice there?”

“The man’s notorious for pettiness and avarice—traits mirrored in his disciples.”

“You’d marvel at what followed,” Wang Jun said. “Determined to humble Elder Xiang, Guan Yu relinquished the Emperor’s Seal, vowing to fight unaided.”

“Madness!” Xiao Zhi exclaimed. “However mediocre among elders, Xiang’s still a centenarian cultivator! Without the seal, Guan Yu’s courting disaster!”

“So all thought. Yet listen—Guan Yu proposed a wager: should he lose, he’d surrender the Emperor’s Seal. Trapped before the entire sect, Elder Xiang had no choice but accept.”

“Insanity! The Emperor’s Seal rivals immortal artifacts! To stake it...”

Wang Jun raised a hand. “Hear the rest. When Xiang offered his measly Iron Ruler as collateral, Guan Yu demanded fifty years of the elder’s cultivation essence instead.”

“Fifty years?! Is Guan Yu seeking shortcuts? Forced cultivation leaps invite catastrophe!”

“You mistake his aim,” Wang Jun smiled. “He seeks that essence... for you.”

“Me?!”

“To purge your blood toxin. Elder Lu already contributed fifty years’ cultivation to suppress it. Guan Yu aims to complete the cure.”

**Chapter 3,839: Clear Skies**

Xiao Zhi gaped. “Cure the incurable? The Demon Sect’s control mechanism...”

“Guan Yu claims it’s possible—with a century’s cultivation essence. Now Elder Xiang’s debt completes the requirement.”

“But the duel’s outcome...”

Wang Jun grinned. “Guan Yu drew his Desert Eagle! Remember how he slew the Blood Lord and Lu Manor’s master? A single shot to Xiang’s leg ended the fight.”

“He didn’t kill him?!”

“Merely disabled. Sect law forbids lethal duels. Now Xiang must honor his debt—and you shall be cleansed.”

Xiao Zhi exhaled shakily. “That reckless... but ingenious devil! Using the seal as bait...”

“Precisely. While others fret about turmoil, Guan Yu crafts solutions from chaos. The path ahead remains fraught, but for now—rejoice in sunlight breaking through storm clouds.”
