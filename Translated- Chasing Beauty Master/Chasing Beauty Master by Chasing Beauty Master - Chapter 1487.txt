“Good, let us go now. I believe only by questioning this Liu Yun will we uncover the truth. I’m certain she knows this person’s true identity.”

Young Master Li spoke urgently, descending the stairs alone first. Leveraging Magistrate Pang’s authority, he gathered a troop of several dozen soldiers and set off toward Liu Yun’s home.

Magistrate Pang followed shortly after, thinking to himself, *This Young Master Li truly knows no bounds! How dare he use my authority to mobilize government soldiers? This blatant disrespect is intolerable.*

Though Magistrate Pang appeared timid and forbearing, such men often harbored hidden ruthlessness. Those who bided their time were the most dangerous—they waited patiently for the perfect moment to strike, leaving their enemies no chance to defend themselves. This was precisely what Magistrate Pang now plotted.

While Young Master Li blustered daily, his mind lacked Magistrate Pang’s cunning. Though the magistrate outwardly deferred to the young noble, it was merely tolerance born of greed—silver, not fear, stayed his hand.

The procession, led by Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li, arrived at Liu Yun’s home. From afar, Li noticed the wooden gate stood ajar.

“Trouble! They may have fled!” Li waved his arm. “Quickly, follow me!”

The gate, already cracked open, was kicked wide by Li. The small courtyard lay empty. A search of the house revealed no one—only stripped cabinets and abandoned rags remained.

“The bastard! If I ever see him again, I’ll carve him into eight pieces!” Li roared, overturning a table in fury.

Magistrate Pang observed, “They anticipated our arrival. Though this man may be a swindler, his connection to Liu Yun’s family is clear.”

“Of course they’re connected!” Li snapped. “Why else would they warn her to flee?”

In the inner chamber, Li found an incense burner coated in ash—the ancestral tablet it once held was gone. This space had likely enshrined Liu Yun’s deceased husband. *Had I acted sooner,* Li fumed, *none would have escaped.*

Unbeknownst to them, Guan Yu and Wang Jun had already departed on horseback. After fruitlessly scouring the streets for traces of the Mohist Sect, they resolved to escort Liu Yun and her daughter to safety.

“We must head to Zhouji City,” Wang Jun declared. “Staying here serves no purpose.”

Liu Yun drove the carriage while Guan Yu and Wang Jun rode alongside. The younger daughter, Xiao Yuan, slept inside until her mother’s weeping awoke her.

Approaching the carriage, Guan Yu said gently, “Liu Yun, I must tell you something difficult.”

“Speak. I’ve endured worse,” she replied, steadying herself.

“Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li orchestrated the disappearances. They abducted women, ‘educated’ them through torture, then sold them as slaves. Your husband discovered this—his honesty cost him his life.”

“You’re certain they killed him?” Liu Yun’s eyes brimmed. Guan Yu nodded silently.

Tears fell as she pleaded, “Guan Yu, I beg you—avenge him. As a woman with a child, I cannot do this myself.”

“You needn’t ask. Those beasts will face justice,” Guan Yu vowed.

When he added that her eldest daughter had also suffered Li’s cruelty, Liu Yun’s composure shattered. Her wails filled the air until Xiao Yuan emerged, wiping her mother’s tears with tiny sleeves.

Wang Jun rode back, chiding Guan Yu: “Must you rip open old wounds? Action, not words, brings solace!”

Guan Yu acknowledged his error. After Liu Yun regained her resolve, they continued their journey.

“Wang Jun,” Guan Yu proposed, “ride ahead to Zhouji City. Find the Mohist Sect’s outpost and signal me.”

“With what? I’ve no signaling tools!”

“You’re their informant—get a flare from them.”

Wang Jun galloped off like an arrow as Guan Yu stayed with the grieving family.

Meanwhile, in the Mohist Sect, Wang Xiaorong paced restlessly. Though confined by her father—the Sect Master—her thoughts lingered on Guan Yu’s whereabouts.

“Why fixate on that boy?” The Sect Master approached as she stretched. “Countless worthy suitors—”

“None compare!” she interrupted. “Guan Yu surpasses all—in wealth, skill, and spirit!”

“What of Jiang City’s young master? His prospects—”

“A philanderer!” She scoffed. “Guan Yu’s homeland holds riches beyond Jiang’s dreams!”

The Sect Master’s laughter rumbled. “Shall I inspect this legendary homeland myself?”

“You’d terrify his villagers!” she teased. “Stay here, Father.”

“If he’s to be my son-in-law—”

“You admit it!” she crowed.

“I admit nothing!” he grumbled, though affection softened his glare. Their banter continued, sunlight filtering through courtyard trees as sect life unfolded around them.
