Ma Tong wore an expression of hesitation as he stammered, “Brother, you can see the state my casino is in now. After suffering such heavy losses, I can’t just abandon it. Reopening as soon as possible is my top priority. As for dealing with Guan Yu… that’s not urgent. Let’s wait a while longer.”

Having pondered all night and gathered information from contacts, Ma Tong now understood Guan Yu better—a man of unfathomable depths. Provoking him recklessly might backfire. Though vengeance for last night’s humiliation burned in his heart, Guan Yu was no ordinary foe. Caution was paramount.

Bi Erlin hadn’t expected Ma Tong’s reluctance. The man’s tone hinted at dissatisfaction, an unwillingness to collaborate against Guan Yu—a refusal to board their sinking ship.

Fang Su interjected smoothly, “Master Ma is right to prioritize reopening. The casino’s severe damage requires extensive renovations. Fortunately, I know skilled contractors. I’ll have them start repairs immediately—free of charge.”

As Fang Su spoke, he exchanged a glance with Bi Erlin. Both understood: if Ma Tong rejected even this offer, it would confirm either his refusal to join their scheme or his covert allegiance to Guan Yu.

In that case, an enemy he’d become. Bi Erlin wouldn’t tolerate half-measures. Ma Tong’s casino dreams? A fantasy.

A veteran of business intrigues, Ma Tong read their intentions effortlessly. Trapped between two dangers—neither Guan Yu nor Bi Erlin could be slighted—he weighed his options carefully.

“Actually, I have my own professional renovation team…” Ma Tong ventured.

Bi Erlin’s face hardened as he locked eyes with Fang Su.

Noting their reactions, Ma Tong quickly backtracked: “But if Young Master Fang has suitable workers, that’d save me the trouble of summoning my team from out of town. My gratitude.”

Bi Erlin’s demeanor thawed instantly. “Rest assured, Master Ma. Fang Su’s men are experts. Your casino will reopen in grandeur.”

Resigned, Ma Tong exchanged pleasantries before seeing them off. At the entrance, Bi Erlin turned: “I trust your casino will reopen within three days. You must invite me to the grand reopening.”

“Hahaha! Of course! Even if I invite no one else, you two brothers will be first on the list,” Ma Tong forced a laugh.

“Excellent,” Bi Erlin pressed. “In three days, we’ll finalize plans against Guan Yu. I’ll ensure he pays for wrecking your casino.”

Suppressing irritation at this parting jab, Ma Tong smiled tightly. “Then we’ll speak in three days. For now, I trust Young Master Fang will dispatch those workers promptly.”

“Consider it done,” Fang Su assured. “Post supervisors if you wish—any issues can be addressed immediately.”

As their car sped toward the Feng estate, Ma Tong muttered at the retreating taillights: “Bastards. Dragging me into their feud with Guan Yu? Using me as cannon fodder? Dream on.”

Though Guan Yu’s men had razed his casino, Ma Tong understood underworld rules—operating without local approval invited retaliation. Until investigations clarified Guan Yu’s true power, rash moves could prove disastrous.

Last night’s inquiries among City A contacts painted Guan Yu as an indomitable force surrounded by elite guards. Friends warned against confrontation, advising diplomacy instead. Reports of Guan Yu’s subordinate severely injuring Luo Bo—a top international assassin—cemented Ma Tong’s caution.

For now, reopening took precedence. Let Guan Yu make the next move.

Bi Erlin’s car echoed with frustration. “Ma Tong’s loyalty wavers.”

“The coward fears Guan Yu,” Fang Su sneered. “Useless.”

“If he remains uncommitted in three days,” Bi Erlin coldly vowed, “his ventures here end.”

“Better expel him now,” Fang Su argued. “Left unchecked, he might ally with Guan Yu.”

“But if his reopening is disrupted again…” Bi Erlin mused.

“Too risky,” Fang Su countered. “He’ll be prepared. We need subtler methods.”

At the Feng estate, they found Feng Shaoye slumped before a risqué foreign drama, pallid and trembling—clearly overexerted.

“Keep this up,” Bi Erlin mocked, “and Guan Yu won’t need to kill you.”

“I’m studying techniques!” Feng Shaoye snapped without looking up.

Ignoring him, the conspirators schemed until Feng Shaoye interjected: “Fools. Infiltrate Yu Gang’s new recruits at the Sun Xu leather factory. Bribe them to cause trouble at Ma Tong’s casino—make it look like Guan Yu’s doing.”

The plan struck like lightning. “Brilliant!” Fang Su exclaimed.

“Not bad for a degenerate,” Bi Erlin grudgingly admitted.

Three days later, Ma Tong’s lavishly renovated casino buzzed with activity. Bi Erlin and Fang Su arrived early, observing security measures.

“Thanks to Young Master Fang’s workers,” Ma Tong beamed. “Their round-the-clock efforts restored everything splendidly.”

“Our pleasure,” Fang Su replied through gritted teeth, noting the lack of monetary gratitude.

As guests flooded upstairs to gamble, Fang Su grew anxious—his planted troublemakers were late. Meanwhile, Bi Erlin relished the impending chaos, envisioning Yu Gang’s inevitable retaliation.

The stage was set. Whether through manipulated conflict or forced allegiance, Ma Tong’s neutrality would soon shatter—and Guan Yu’s dominion would face its newest challengers.
