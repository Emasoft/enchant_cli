Upon returning, Wang Xiaorong insisted on taking Qiqi shopping to buy her new clothes. Guan Yu couldn’t dissuade her—let them indulge if they wished. However, safety remained a priority, so Guan Yu discreetly assigned two trusted subordinates to follow them, instructing them to report immediately should any danger arise.

Qiqi’s repeated addresses of “Shiniang” (Master’s Wife) sent Wang Xiaorong into raptures, her joy nearly lifting her to the clouds. With that single term of endearment, Qiqi had utterly conquered Wang Xiaorong.

Seeing the two get along so well, the grandfather felt reassured. With the substantial silver they’d acquired, he believed their future would transform. Later, he planned to discuss next steps with the shopkeeper. As long as Qiqi remained safe, his heart was at ease. He also hoped she would learn genuine skills from Old Cang.

Now, the bond between the two women flourished. Wang Xiaorong took Qiqi shopping, returning with an abundance of purchases—all for Qiqi. Though Qiqi initially refused, Wang Xiaorong insisted that as her “shiniang,” she mustn’t let appearances falter, emphasizing the importance of proper attire.

Beautiful dresses, stylish boots, jewelry, hair ornaments, and rouge—everything was procured. The haul was so vast that hired hands had to carry it back. Wang Xiaorong declared, “Silver is meant to be spent. If something doesn’t suit, toss it. No matter!”

For Qiqi, this was the first time she’d ever received so much. That night, too excited to sleep, she laid out every item in her room, trying on each dress.

As the saying goes, “Clothes make the person, as a saddle adorns a horse.” The radiant Qiqi, clad in her new finery, transformed entirely. Her beauty outshone her previous self, her hair playfully tied with two ribbons, enhancing her charm.

Before her bronze mirror, Qiqi twirled in each dress and pair of boots, marveling at their loveliness. Her natural grace made her feel even more exquisite.

When she emerged, the household gasped. None had imagined such a stunning girl lived among them.

Late in Guan Yu’s chamber, he and Wang Xiaorong removed their disguises. “Qiqi’s truly considerate,” Wang Xiaorong remarked. “When I bought her so much, the poor thing cried nervously. Later, I realized she couldn’t bear seeing so much silver spent.”

“Natural, given her upbringing with her grandfather,” Guan Yu replied. “Accustomed to hardship, frugality runs deep. Today’s haul likely surpasses all she’s ever owned. No wonder she’s overjoyed.”

After tidying up, Wang Xiaorong sat beside Guan Yu on the bed. “You’ve no idea—when Qiqi first tried that dress, I was stunned. Never imagined she’d blossom into such a beauty.”

Guan Yu detected a hint of jealousy in her tone—a sentiment no logic could dispel.

“Qiqi’s obedient and possesses excellent martial potential,” he said. “As her shiniang, you should guide her more.”

The title “shiniang” immediately lifted Wang Xiaorong’s spirits. “Of course! Your disciple is mine. If she needs help, I’ll assist. But cultivating inner energy is arduous—will she endure?”

“She’s weathered hardships since childhood. She’ll manage,” Guan Yu assured.

Wang Xiaorong brightened. “I hope Qiqi becomes a master! Your reputation would soar with such a disciple, reflecting glory on this shiniang too.”

“She still doesn’t know my real name or face,” Guan Yu mused. “We must tell her soon.”

As he spoke, the door burst open. Before Guan Yu could react, a sweet-faced girl stood framed in the doorway—Qiqi, too exhilarated to sleep, had come to show her master her new clothes.

She’d meant to knock, but the unlatched door swung open at her touch.

“Why wasn’t this locked? How could you forget something so crucial?” Guan Yu chided Wang Xiaorong.

After collecting garments, Guan Yu left a silver ingot on the counter—payment, not theft. The sum far exceeded the clothes’ value, easing his conscience. Bundling the items in cloth, he realized the main exit was barred.

The door’s internal locks and thick wooden planks made entry impossible without destruction. Exiting required dismantling the barricade, but doing so would leave the shop vulnerable. Opting to avoid trouble, Guan Yu retreated through the roof.

Upstairs, he found mostly women’s silks and a small loom—likely the young proprietress’s domain. Reentering her room, he grimaced at exiting through her bed’s canopy. Ensuring she remained unconscious, he vaulted onto the rafters and replaced the roof tiles meticulously.

**Meanwhile at the City Lord’s rear gate...**

Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi stole official stationery, crafting a forged token. “You write it,” Wang Jun urged. “Your calligraphy surpasses mine.”

Xiao Zhi replicated bureaucratic script perfectly. As they worried over Guan Yu’s delay, he arrived with a cloth bundle. “Couldn’t find Imperial Guard uniforms,” Guan Yu said, “but these will suffice. We’ll claim we’re undercover investigators.”

“We’ve prepared documents,” Wang Jun said. “If discovered, we flee.”

Inspecting the clothes, Wang Jun froze. “These are women’s garments!”

“They’re large sizes,” Guan Yu insisted. “No floral patterns—suitable enough.” Though differing from Imperial Guard attire, the outfits vaguely resembled those worn during the forest ambush.

At the City Lord’s gate, sleepy guards initially rebuffed them until shown the forged token. “We’re secret envoys investigating the explosion,” Xiao Zhi declared. “His Majesty demands urgency.”

The terrified guards ushered them in, explaining the City Lord’s absence. After establishing their cover, the trio retreated to an inn with two crucial maidservants—eyewitnesses to the City Lord’s murder by imperial archers.

**Chapter 4252: Revelation**

At dawn, Guan Yu combed the fire-ravaged hall. “Why search ashes?” Wang Jun asked. “Nothing remains.”

“The City Lord’s body vanished,” Guan Yu countered. “These maids claim he was arrow-shot before the blaze. We need physical proof to counter the Imperial Guard’s narrative.”

Amidst charred beams, Guan Yu calculated the death spot. “Here—three meters in. If we find the arrowhead...”

Though Wang Jun doubted, Guan Yu sifted debris. Time pressed—authentic Imperial Guards could arrive any hour. Their fabricated identity’s fragility heightened the stakes with each passing moment.
