Guan Yu was not one for ostentation, yet today, for the sake of his beloved and knowing countless hidden cameras were trained on him, he resolved to project an unyielding presence.

As Guan Yu stepped onto the hillside, a barrage of camera flashes erupted. Within seconds, images of the young Chinese man—whose features, though not conventionally striking, radiated an effortless charm—flooded websites across the globe.

Hayakawa Shigeru (Lush Summer), who had been waiting impatiently, frowned as Guan Yu appeared. As a Second-Class Variant, Hayakawa’s senses were razor-sharp. He could gauge Guan Yu’s competence yet refused to believe this youth, seemingly younger than himself, posed any real threat. This duel, born of jealousy over Sakurako’s affections, was a calculated move to thrust the Hayakawa clan back into Eastern Island’s spotlight and seize the world’s shifting tides of power.

Though Hayakawa was Eastern Island’s youngest Second-Class Variant, his clan saw him as the ideal figurehead to exploit the global upheaval following the return of individuals from the Divine Relics. Their strategy was sound—save for their fatal miscalculation in choosing Guan Yu as their pawn.

After Guan Yu’s arrival, Sakurako gasped, informing him the betting odds had shifted again: a deluge of mysterious funds backing his victory had adjusted the ratio to 1:3. Her friends bombarded her with messages, gleeful at their impending windfall.

“I admire your courage to face me,” Hayakawa sneered, though his clan’s whispers of the altered odds pricked his pride. “Win or lose, Sakurako’s safety in your hands seems assured.” Unseen by him, his family’s analysts scrambled to unravel Guan Yu’s origins, certain hidden powers backed this unassuming man.

Hayakawa dismissed the odds, confident even at 1:3. Guan Yu remained an underdog—a perception he met with a careless shrug. “So certain of victory?” he taunted, arms folded.

Hayakawa’s aura erupted, the force of a Second-Class Variant scattering onlookers and toppling cameras. Guan Yu smiled. “Good. A feeble opponent would bore me.”

**Chapter 1728: Speculations**

As Eastern Island’s premier Second-Class Variant among the youth, Hayakawa had dueled nearly every local Variant, even holding his own against First-Class foes. His pride was earned—yet Guan Yu’s sudden shift in demeanor unsettled him. Unlike Hayakawa’s tempestuous aura, Guan Yu’s energy coiled inward, detectable only to true masters. To others, he seemed merely a fit young man, his latent power a silent maelstrom against Hayakawa’s roaring waves.

A premonition flickered in Hayakawa’s mind: *Could this man… defeat me?* He shook his head violently, dispelling the doubt. “He’s Sakurako’s age! Even with ancient martial arts or odd techniques, he can’t rival me!”

As Hayakawa strode forward, a car screeched to a halt—Takashi Ichiro, Sakurako’s father, had arrived. Relieved at his daughter’s safety, he turned to the duelists, intrigued by Guan Yu’s unflinching posture.

“How strong is that Chinese man?” Takashi whispered to his shadowed female Variant bodyguard.

“Formidable,” she replied tersely.

“How formidable?”

“Beyond measure.”

Takashi’s eyes narrowed. His guard, among Eastern Island’s elite First-Class Variants, deemed Guan Yu’s strength surpassing even Ito—a legend. Realization dawned: Guan Yu was *that* man. Why had he come? Why entwined with Sakurako?

The guard reassured him. “Had he ill intent, Sakurako would already be harmed. He likely rescued her from Watanabe’s syndicate.”

Takashi’s fears eased. Approaching Sakurako, he teased, “Admiring your hero?”

She blushed, playfully swatting him. “Of course! Who’d stare at *you*, old man?”

As father and daughter bantered, Hayakawa closed in, unaware of Guan Yu’s true identity. Three meters apart—a lethal range for Variants—Guan Yu smirked. “Hesitating? Let’s end this spectacle.”

Hayakawa raised his katana. “I’ll crush you utterly.”

**Chapter 1729: Invisibility**

Sakurako’s heart soared at her father’s tacit approval, oblivious to his concerns. Takashi knew Guan Yu’s reputation—a polygamist CEO entwined with his business empire. Yet for now, Sakurako’s gaze held only adoration.

“Guan, kill him!” she shouted, drawing stares. Chastised, she amended, “Just… don’t kill him! And Hayakawa—good luck!”

The crowd chuckled, tension easing. Guan Yu nodded. “A month in bed, then.”

Hayakawa’s blade flashed—then he vanished. The crowd roared, anticipating Guan Yu’s downfall. But Guan Yu’s senses pierced the invisibility, a smirk playing on his lips. Hayakawa’s technique, evolved from ninjutsu, was child’s play to his divine awareness.

As Hayakawa lunged, Guan Yu vanished—reappearing behind him. The crowd gasped. Hayakawa twisted, stabbing backward, only to find empty air. Sweat beaded his brow.

Guan Yu materialized, arms still folded. “Is this all?”

Hayakawa’s strike met nothing. The crowd’s jeers turned to murmurs. Invisibility faltered, revealing his stunned face. Guan Yu’s chuckle echoed. “Your turn.”
