Xiao Zhi walked to the doorway at this moment. He had no intention of letting this Demon Sect woman get involved in their serious affairs. Making an inviting gesture, he said, "Apologies, but we fellow disciples have crucial matters to discuss. Please take your leave now."

Wang Xiaorong immediately looked at Guanyu with anxious eyes, hoping he would ask her to stay. Never had she imagined these people would start driving her away.

"Guanyu, do you truly dislike my presence so much?" Wang Xiaorong asked with sorrowful expression, appearing pitifully vulnerable.

"Nothing personal," Guanyu replied. "We simply walk different paths. We need to discuss our plans for Duobao Mountain, and your presence would be inconvenient. You should go."

Wang Xiaorong felt deeply wronged. She'd come specifically to see Guanyu, only to be expelled like this! Were it not for Guanyu's presence, she would have already unleashed her fury.

If she left now, they'd still proceed to Duobao Mountain anyway. Perhaps joining them would be better - she could ensure Guanyu's safety while treating it as amusement. Others' lives concerned her not.

Moreover, the Duobao Mountain matter hadn't been her revelation to Guanyu. That blunder belonged to Steward Sun. If the Demon Sovereign demanded accountability later, she had ready excuses.

"Don't you want me accompanying you into Duobao Mountain?" Wang Xiaorong suddenly proposed. "I know that place far better than you. With me as guide, your survival chances increase dramatically."

This was precisely what Guanyu had been waiting for. The playful girl proved easily manipulated. Rising, he said, "You'd truly join us? Truthfully, I'd love exploring with you. After handling this serious business, I'll devote three days and nights to your amusement. How's that?"

"Hehe, splendid! You've said it yourself - no taking back your word later!" Wang Xiaorong replied delightedly.

Xiao Zhi and Aze exchanged satisfied glances. Having the Demon Soul Sect's young mistress as hostage meant even the Demon Sovereign himself wouldn't dare move against them now.

Guanyu pressed further: "But how did your sect discover Duobao Mountain's entrance here? You've known this location long, haven't you?"

"Naturally!" Wang Xiaorong retorted. "Have you forgotten? Ancestor Menghua founded our Demon Sect. His legacy remains our sect's heritage! The Eight-Drum Technique rightfully belongs to us. How shameless you self-proclaimed 'righteous' folk are, stealing what's ours!"

Guanyu's face burned under her accusation. She spoke truth - they were indeed intruders. Legends claimed the Eight-Drum Technique could grant supremacy over all cultivation realms, making its wielder invincible.

Guanyu argued, "The Technique may have been yours millennia past. But such unparalleled power in Demon Sect hands would bring endless calamity! We must prevent you from obtaining it to protect the martial world's peace."

"Pah! Such self-righteous posturing!" Wang Xiaorong scoffed. "You claim we're evil, yet your 'virtuous' sects scheme more poisonously than we ever do - you simply hide behind moral pretences!"

Guanyu privately agreed. Disciples like Xiao Zhi and Aze, steeped in Yunqing Sect's teachings, blindly believed their sect's inherent righteousness. But Guanyu's upbringing and historical knowledge showed how "virtuous" factions often practiced hypocrisy while demonic sects displayed clearer principles.

"Perhaps you're right," Guanyu conceded. "But we serve different masters now. When everyone believes themselves righteous, conflict becomes inevitable."

At least the Demon Sect members appeared more honorable than Red Lotus Sect's scum. In Guanyu's eyes, those degenerates surpassed even demons in vileness.

Chapter 3512: Records

Wang Xiaorong suggested, "Why not depart immediately? What's left to wait for? I'm eager to investigate."

"No rush," Guanyu calmly replied. "Duobao Mountain lies far, and your sect's members just entered. We've time before following."

Xiao Zhi interjected, "This puzzles me - why would Duobao Mountain's entrance be in Qin Manor when the mountain itself lies distant? It defies logic!"

"What's illogical?" Wang Xiaorong retorted. "Aren't you Master Qin's nephew? How ignorant! Perhaps you're an imposter? Not that it matters - this knowledge belongs solely to our Demon Soul Sect."

Guanyu added, "I'm equally curious. How did you identify that rockery as the entrance? Why here?"

Seeing all eyes upon her, Wang Xiaorong explained, "To the uninformed, the distant entrance seems strange. The truth lies in history. Qin Manor stands on land occupied for millennia. Though rebuilt repeatedly, this site originally housed Ancestor Menghua's residence a thousand years past."

Gasps of surprise met this revelation. Guanyu instantly grasped the implications.

Wang Xiaorong continued, "My father possesses records detailing Menghua's legacy. After finding no entrance around Duobao Mountain itself, we deduced it must connect here - Menghua's former dwelling."

Guanyu nodded, "So Menghua and his lover lived here, with Duobao Mountain being their important retreat. He likely tunneled to the mountain for convenience, creating this secret passage."

"Exactly father's conclusion," Wang Xiaorong confirmed. "Initial investigations confirmed the hypothesis."

Chapter 3513: I Don't Believe It

Xiao Zhi demanded, "What exactly is this Eight-Drum artifact?"

Wang Xiaorong elaborated, "The Eight-Drums were Menghua's divine instrument after reaching God Realm cultivation. A supreme immortal artifact. When enemies came for him and his beloved, he discovered her betrayal - she'd poisoned him and conspired with rivals to steal the artifact."

The group listened raptly as she recounted Menghua's tragedy: his poisoning, betrayal by a lover impersonating his true beloved, desperate escape despite mortal wounds, and eventual founding of the Demon Sect to exact vengeance.

"After twenty years building an invincible sect," she continued, "Menghua marched to Duobao Mountain for revenge, only to find righteous sects lying in ambush. The month-long battle left both sides devastated. With dying strength, Menghua retreated into Duobao Mountain and immolated his soul to transmute the Eight-Drums into the legendary Technique."

Guanyu murmured, "A tragic tale. No pain compares to a lover's betrayal."

Xiao Zhi objected, "I don't believe this! The orthodox accounts differ completely!"

Wang Xiaorong sneered, "Fool! Your 'histories' were rewritten by victors. My account comes from Menghua's own journals. Which holds more credibility?"

Guanyu interceded, "Ancient truths are hard to verify. Arguing serves no purpose now."

Changing subjects, he asked, "Xiaorong, does the Eight-Drum Technique truly grant supreme power?"

"Legends claim so," she shrugged. "But the technique divides into four scrolls - east, south, west, north. All must be obtained to unlock Menghua's full legacy. They're unlikely all in Duobao Mountain - Menghua wouldn't concentrate such power."

Guanyu mused, "Makes sense. But even supreme techniques depend on the cultivator's talent."

"Exactly!" Wang Xiaorong agreed. "Our Demon Sect's methods differ from yours, but ultimately channel spiritual energy similarly. Take Blackblood Ridge's Bloodwing Technique - though its transformations appear monstrous, it's still essence manipulation!"

Guanyu chuckled, "Fair point. Though that blood-red monstrosity still unsettles me..."
