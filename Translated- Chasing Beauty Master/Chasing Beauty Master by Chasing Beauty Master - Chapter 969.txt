“After years of living freely, he had no desire to maintain a household full of concubines. Moreover, someone like him navigating the underworld faced constant peril. Keeping his children close would expose them to too much danger.

Boss Kong was a meticulous man. By now, Bear should have succeeded. His garden compound only housed over twenty enforcers.

Pressed for time, he couldn’t summon reinforcements from elsewhere. Sending all his men out left him unprotected, and unease gnawed at him.

The rumble of an engine approached. A black van rolled into view and abruptly halted before Boss Kong. He initially thought Bear had returned.

‘Seems things went smoothly,’ Boss Kong muttered with a smile, unperturbed. In better spirits today, he normally forbade vehicles in his garden to protect his flowers from exhaust fumes.

A sleek sports car followed, stirring suspicion. Could Bear be displaying a hijacked vehicle? But that didn’t add up.

As Boss Kong pondered, a heavy thud echoed. A bulky object tumbled from the car, sending the two beauties beside him into ear-piercing shrieks.

Boss Kong’s eyes widened—it was Bear. Another thud. Instinctively, he reached beneath his rocking chair.

Hidden there was a pistol, reserved for emergencies. Today, it would prove useful.

Bang! The gunshot sent the women crouching, hands clamped over their ears.

Boss Kong drew his weapon, but Guan Yu’s bullet struck his right shoulder. The gun clattered to the ground, snatched up by Jia Bo, who now aimed at Boss Kong’s head. ‘Don’t move! Bullets aren’t picky.’

Guan Yu advanced, Desert Eagle in hand, while Xue Jing scanned their surroundings vigilantly.

‘Who are you?!’ Boss Kong clutched his bleeding shoulder, face paling.

‘The one you invited—or rather, the one Shen Fangcheng wanted.’ Guan Yu smirked. ‘My fees are steep. Can you afford them?’

‘You’re Guan Yu?’ Boss Kong gritted through pain.

‘Indeed. You summoned me. Speak.’

Sweat drenched Boss Kong’s brow. ‘You dare shoot me?! You’ll pay for this!’

‘Oh? A corpse can’t collect debts.’ Guan Yu leveled the gun.

‘Mercy, Master Guan!’ Boss Kong’s defiance crumbled. ‘No quarrel exists between us! That bastard Shen Fangcheng paid me a million to target you! Take it all—just lower the gun!’

‘Fear’s wise. But colluding with Shen displeases me. Let’s see if your three heads and six arms live up to the tales.’ Guan Yu waved the gun tauntingly.

‘Spare me, I beg!’

Guan Yu ordered Jia Bo, ‘Search the place. Carefully.’

Chapter 2,478: A Lesson

Jia Bo and five others ransacked the garden with gleeful abandon. Behind them, over a hundred Yu Gang members swarmed in.

Boss Kong paled further. These weren’t mere students—their disciplined semicircle formation screamed veteran enforcers.

Twenty minutes later, Jia Bo reported a vault embedded in concrete. Guan Yu dismissed it—cash or contraband held no interest.

‘Boss Kong,’ Guan Yu intoned, ‘this bullet’s a warning. Cut ties with Shen Fangcheng.’

‘Never again!’ Boss Kong vowed.

‘Good. Cross the Yu Gang again, and the next shot won’t miss.’

With a shout, the gang withdrew.

Boss Kong, ghostly pale from blood loss, staggered to the hospital.

Back in Qiaoyuan District, Jia Bo grumbled, ‘Why spare him? His men nearly killed you! That vault—’

‘Gluttony chokes,’ Guan Yu cut in. ‘Patience. Opportunities will come.’

Though puzzled, Jia Bo nodded. ‘I’ll distribute rewards.’

‘Monitor Shen. He’ll flee with cash. Catch him and hand this to the police.’ Guan Yu passed Shen’s signed confession.

‘Reorganize the gang. Reward merit, punish faults. Build structure.’

Guan Yu mused—without his cultivation, direct vengeance against the Feng Clan must wait. Strengthening the Yu Gang became paramount.

Jia Bo vowed, ‘Wei Hongwei and I will handle it.’

‘Set traps tonight. Catch whoever’s targeting our members.’

As Guan Yu returned home, Xue Jing berated him. ‘No more risks! You’re mortal now!’

‘You’re my shield,’ he teased.

‘Against a dozen guns? I’m no deity! Promise me!’

Relenting, Guan Yu agreed. The day’s brush with death lingered.

That evening, Wei Hongwei called, whining about missing the action. Guan Yu chuckled until a yelp and Qian Yaoyao’s scolding ended the call.

Chapter 2,479: Moochers

Nightlife pulsed at the Dinghong Bar. A blond-haired youth dubbed Lion King eyed a girl in denim overalls at the counter.

‘Drink?’ He swayed, offering his bottle.

She drained it in one go, cheeks flushing.

‘Feisty! I’m Yu Gang. Stick with me.’ He led her outside, unaware of six pursuers.

In a dim alley, Lion King pinned her against a wall—until taunts echoed.

‘Yu Gang, huh?’ Men brandished pipes and stun batons closed in.

Lion King spat defiance. ‘Touch me and—’

‘Attack!’

Wooden barriers crashed down, trapping the thugs. Unfazed, Lion King resumed his tryst as allies ambushed the attackers.

The leader barked ‘Retreat!’—too late. The Yu Gang’s net tightened.
