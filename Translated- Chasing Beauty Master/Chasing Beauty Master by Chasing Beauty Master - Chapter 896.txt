“Either they’ll be discovered, but if they remain undetected, even an extra person wouldn’t be noticed. The situation inside should be chaotic enough, and the people there are utterly selfish. No one cares about matters that don’t directly concern them.”

Acai strongly agreed with Guan Yu’s assessment, and the conditions inside were indeed disorderly.

“Either they’ll be discovered, but if they remain undetected, even an extra person wouldn’t be noticed. The situation inside should be chaotic enough, and the people there are utterly selfish. No one cares about matters that don’t directly concern them.”

Acai strongly agreed with Guan Yu’s assessment, and the conditions inside were indeed disorderly.

It was as if Acai had spent years within those walls. He didn’t recognize the two people killed by Second Only to Wolf—pickled vegetables, as they were called—nor had he ever seen them before. Even the blindfolded little boy was a stranger to him.

Jinhua understood Guan Yu’s logic: if someone inside noticed them, it wouldn’t matter whether Acai was with them or not. If no one vigilant was present, bringing Acai posed no issue, and he could even help identify some routes.

After finalizing their plan, Guan Yu had Second Only to Wolf board the vehicle as well, instructing him to hide inside. “Once we enter, we’ll get out first. Don’t reveal yourself unless a fight breaks out,” Guan Yu said. Second Only to Wolf nodded. Guan Yu pressed a remote control in the car, and the stone-built gate ahead slowly parted.

Upon entering, they realized the interior was a massive warehouse divided into sections, seemingly empty at first glance.

The warehouse was enormous, roughly the size of two basketball courts. People inside were occupied with unclear tasks. Guan Yu noticed a row of parked vehicles in one corner and casually drove toward them to blend in.

Acai peered outside, recalling, “No, we need to go underground. This area is just offices and sleeping quarters.”

In Acai’s memory, the place he’d been held was far more dilapidated, where abducted individuals were trained and tortured. That location wasn’t here.

Guan Yu turned the car around, heading toward a tunnel leading underground. Jinhua monitored the surveillance, noting only two cameras at the exit and no other security measures.

“This place is as lax as our organization,” Second Only to Wolf remarked. “People here avoid each other, constantly wary of betrayal. Internal strife is frequent, so everyone minds their own business.”

As Guan Yu drove underground, the structure resembled a parking garage. After a turn, they encountered another checkpoint.

Trouble loomed—Guan Yu had no credentials if asked. He parked, observing two middle-aged men in a nearby room. One slept in a chair; the other fiddled with his phone.

Noticing the car, the awake man glanced over, seemingly familiar with the vehicle. “How’d it go?” he asked.

Guan Yu rolled the window halfway, revealing only his forehead. Calmly, he replied, “Smooth. The kid worked efficiently today—decent haul.”

“Good. Knew your people deliver,” the man said, pressing a remote to raise the barrier.

Guan Yu accelerated inward, heart pounding. Jinhua exhaled deeply. The checkpoint guards recognized the car and its occupants, aware of their mission. Thankfully, no ID check occurred.

The underground space was vast, matching the surface. Guan Yu searched for parked vehicles to blend in.

“This is the first underground level,” Acai said, pointing. “New captives are taken to the second level for indoctrination. Park near that lit room—it’s the leader’s quarters.”

They’d infiltrated successfully. The underground bustled with more activity than above.

Guan Yu removed the boy’s blindfold, untied his hands, and let him run. The boy sprinted west, where rows of tiny, cell-like rooms housed expressionless men and women behind iron bars.

“Acai, did you live in those cages?” Guan Yu asked. The occupants were clearly abductees.

Acai nodded silently, spotting his former cell. Returning now with freedom, he vowed never to endure that hell again.

The east side housed higher-ranking members in relative luxury. Guan Yu, Jinhua, and Acai exited the car.

“Only two cameras monitor the exits above,” Jinhua whispered. “Most here surveil the cages. Two more cameras watch the underground exits.”

Guan Yu noted the lax security—complacency from years without incident. The denizens now treated this human trafficking den as a legitimate tea factory, their guard dissolved.

This negligence favored Guan Yu’s team. He carried wallets stolen by the boy earlier—evidence of the night’s “work.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety-Seven: Ignorance of Rules**

The complacent inhabitants now viewed this place as their true organization, a lawful tea factory, forgetting its criminal nature.

Their carelessness played into Guan Yu’s hands. He discarded his disguise, revealing his true face alongside Jinhua. Second Only to Wolf joined them, leading Acai eastward.

Guan Yu resolved to confront anyone blocking their path. The priority was capturing the leader, hopefully still present.

Acai had never seen the leader despite years here. Abductees were divided into groups, each managed by an instructor. New captives were lowly slaves. Only those proving useful through successful missions earned trust, graduating to independent roles after thorough brainwashing.

Instructors received bonuses for recommending capable subordinates, though most remained petty thieves. Higher ranks, like Chen Xiaona’s, enjoyed limited freedom but obeyed all orders.

The burly man killed earlier was the boy’s instructor, celebrating his first successful theft before meeting Second Only to Wolf’s blade.

Guan Yu aimed to purge this den. They headed toward a brightly lit eastern room—a meeting hall where nine figures convened.

“No wonder it’s quiet outside,” Guan Yu muttered before barging in. The attendees, high-ranking members planning tomorrow’s mission, froze at the intrusion.

A fifty-something woman named Karasi—a Westerner with wrinkled skin, a double chin, cropped hair, and glaringly white dentures—slammed the table. “Whose subordinates are these? Have you lost your minds? This is a critical meeting!”

Her rage silenced the room. None recognized the intruders.

Guan Yu, realizing Karasi was the leader, announced, “We’re here for him,” pointing at a skeletal, towering man in a tight black shirt—a Second-Class Venerable Mid Stage cultivator.

Karasi, whose cultivation level Guan Yu couldn’t discern, berated the man: “Gao Shen! Is this how you discipline your men? Such insolence!”

**Chapter Two Thousand Two Hundred and Ninety-Eight: Exit and Close the Door**

Guan Yu shot a reproachful glance at Second Only to Wolf, who’d chuckled at the gaunt man’s effeminate voice. “This is serious,” Guan Yu muttered, though Jinhua and Acai stifled laughs.

The skeletal man’s grotesque appearance—bald, elongated skull, emaciated frame—disgusted them.

Karasi, fuming, addressed her council: “One of you owns these brats. Confess now, or face execution later!”

Guan Yu interjected, “Save your breath. We’re outsiders here to end this.”

The room stirred. Karasi, still oblivious to the threat, sneered, “You’ll regret this intrusion.”

Second Only to Wolf yawned. “Let’s finish this cesspool quickly.”

Guan Yu surveyed the room—Karasi’s aura hinted at First-Class Venerable strength or higher. The skeletal man, though weaker, radiated menace.

“Enough talk,” Guan Yu declared, energy surging. “Tonight, this empire falls.”

Chaos erupted as blades flashed. The “tea factory” would brew no more poison.
