“It seems Guo Dong has learned a great deal here these past few days. He seems to grasp even those aspects over there. This brings Guan Yu some relief—at least Guo Dong is motivated to improve and study. That’s a good sign.”

The factory director stood up and said, “Boss, has something happened at the factory? Shutting down production for a week would incur significant losses. Moreover, we just finalized a deal with a client last night—a long-standing partner whose leather goods processing is quite urgent.”

Guan Yu, though naturally proud of the factory’s operations, knew halting production to mitigate losses was preferable to risking danger. He replied, “Both of you arrange this. Ensure production is suspended within the shortest possible timeframe—no more than a week.”

Guo Dong remained silent, taking the plan sheet back to his desk and scrutinizing documents within a blue folder.

After a moment, he addressed Guan Yu: “Boss, the earliest we can halt production is tomorrow night. A week-long shutdown would delay orders from two clients. We’ll need to coordinate with HR.”

Guan Yu rose. “Good. Contact HR immediately. During this week, I’ll oversee major renovations at the factory. After visiting today, I found the environment utterly unacceptable. I refuse to let my employees work in such hazardous conditions—it endangers their health.”

“We must upgrade the ventilation and fire safety systems to ensure safe working conditions. Employee health and safety are paramount. Implement regular medical checkups—this is crucial. Understood?”

The factory director hadn’t anticipated Guan Yu’s shutdown motive being worker welfare. He felt newfound respect. Under Sun Xu’s previous management, corners were cut for profit—worker conditions never mattered. Regular health checks? Unthinkable. Guan Yu’s approach was revolutionary. The director marveled at the boss willingly incurring losses and client dissatisfaction to create safe, clean workspaces—truly admirable.

“Rest assured, Boss,” the director vowed. “I’ll notify all departments to prepare. We’ll announce the week-long paid leave tomorrow night. The day after, we’ll begin as you instructed.”

“Not the day after—work starts tomorrow night post-shift. Round-the-clock operations. Upgrading ventilation and exhaust systems in such a large factory isn’t simple. We must complete this within the week.”

Guo Dong inquired, “Boss, have you secured workers yet? Should I assist in recruiting?”

“I planned to arrange that later. If you can find help, even better—more hands accelerate progress. The factory’s vast—more workers shorten timelines.”

“Understood. I’ll make calls immediately.” Guo Dong nodded.

Guan Yu actually intended to recruit Wei Hongwei, whose father worked construction—he’d have ample labor connections.

“Additionally,” Guan Yu continued, “replace all outdated fire equipment. No goods may obstruct fire exits or safety systems—disseminate this immediately.”

“No problem. I’ll inform each department personally.”

“Good. Nothing else for now. Tomorrow, Wei Hongwei will coordinate specifics—follow his instructions.” With that, Guan Yu departed.

Current physical labor exceeded Jia Bo’s capacity—his arm injury still healing. Wei Hongwei would lead the renovation crew personally.

Guan Yu knew Wei would relish this lucrative assignment—every fool recognized its kickback potential. Syndicate funds flowed here, and Wei never missed embezzlement opportunities.

When Guan Yu called, background noise assaulted the line. “Where are you, punk? What’s that racket?”

“Boss! What’s up? Yao Yao and I are at her family’s internet café. After police compensation for the recent vandalism, we’re renovating. Just supervising since we’re free.”

“I need you to contact your father—have him recruit skilled workers. Tomorrow, we’re overhauling the tannery’s fire and ventilation systems. Current airflow’s inadequate—severe air pollution. Requires full duct cleaning and larger exhaust fans. Your father can handle this?”

Wei asked curiously, “Boss, isn’t production smooth? Why renovate now?”

“Nonsense! Want me to assign you factory duty? Test conditions yourself?”

“No no no! Don’t worry—I’ll find your workers.”

“More the better. Extensive ductwork needs 24/7 cleaning—requires manpower.”

“Relax, Boss. Professional cleaners? I’ll recruit hundreds—guarantee swift completion.”

“Good. Task’s yours. More instructions later.” Guan Yu hung up.

Wei grinned at Yao Yao. “Another sweet assignment from Boss! Gonna make bank this time!”

Qian Yao Yao glared. “Guan Yu treats you decently, yet you embezzle syndicate funds? How can you smile so shamelessly?”

**Chapter 2721: Wasted Potential**

“Yao Yao, syndicate money molds unused. Better in my pockets anyway. Besides, funds overflow—as second-in-command Head Hall Master, spending syndicate resources is my right.” Wei rationalized brazenly.

Yao Yao sighed. “Your audacity terrifies.”

Early morning found Fang Su rising restlessly—unfamiliar lodgings at the Feng residence disrupted sleep. Spotting Luo Bo exercising in the courtyard, Fang approached: “Grandmaster Luo Bo, up so early?”

Luo Bo nodded impassively. “Young Master Fang arrives early—from home?” Mistaking Fang for an early visitor.

“Actually, I stayed overnight. Must thank you for eliminating Xiao Mu yesterday—saved me great trouble.”

“Duty-bound to protect my Young Master—you’re included. No thanks needed.”

“I’ll head inside then.” Fang entered, curiosity burning about Luo Bo’s injury origin but discretion prevailing. Questioning the humiliating defeat might provoke hostility.

Fang had witnessed Luo Bo’s prowess—a supreme First-Class Adept, godlike in his eyes. Yet Guan Yu possessed subordinates surpassing even this? Unthinkable! Though desperate to know who wounded Luo Bo, Fang wisely refrained.

Luo Bo himself brooded over the defeat. Never imagined Second-Only-to-Wolf would best him so thoroughly. Outwardly recovered, internal injuries from that sword qi required prolonged recuperation. Complacent in the Biers’ luxury, he’d neglected cultivation, assuming his First-Class status invincible.

Years ago, Second-Only-to-Wolf had been insignificant—a fledgling First-Class versus Luo Bo’s seasoned mastery. Now, after years of laxity, defeat reignited competitive fire. Daily cultivation resumed, analyzing that fatal blade strike—concluding only raw power or blinding speed could counter it. This humiliation paradoxically revived Luo Bo’s warrior spirit.

**Chapter 2722: Return Visit**

In the Feng mansion’s east wing dining hall, four figures occupied a five-meter table: Bier Lin, Fang Su, Young Master Feng, and wheelchair-bound Patriarch Feng. Diabetic complications had claimed the patriarch’s left pinky toe, recent surgery proving ineffective. Typically bedridden, today’s rare vigor brought him downstairs.

Bier Lin spoke through mouthfuls: “Fang Su, what’s Ma Tong’s current stance toward us?”

“An outsider in our metropolis—he’ll comply. Especially fearing your Bier Family influence. He’d never dare oppose you.”

“Should we approach him again today?”

“For what? He avoids conflict with Guan Yu but fears you equally. Likely refuses meetings with either—playing neutral.”

Bier Lin’s face darkened. “Unacceptable. Either Ma Tong allies with us, or his casino dies. This city tolerates only two powers—ours or Guan Yu’s. Third parties? Only as allies.”

Ma Tong’s predicament stemmed from Bier Lin’s coercion against Guan Yu. Now hiding outside City A, he operated three casinos across major cities. The new A City venture, launched during the Treasure Map frenzy targeting wealthy patrons, now jeopardized by this power struggle.

Fang Su suggested: “Let’s visit his casino after breakfast—test his willingness.”

At the casino, the assistant manager fawned: “Honored Young Master Bier! What brings you—?”

“Where’s Ma Tong?” Bier Lin marched toward offices, Fang Su trailing eagerly—perhaps another glimpse of Madame Ma’s allure.

“Apologies, Young Master! Boss Ma departed this morning.”

Bier Lin whirled, eyes blazing. “Departed? Where?!”
