“Am I wrong, Jiang the Turtle?” Guan Yu sneered at Jiang Ziqi (Son of Chess)’s reaction. “Don’t think you’re still some snot-nosed brat sucking on lollipops. When I beat you, you whimpered like a jilted little girl. Even if you complain to your grandfather about this beating, you won’t gain any advantage.”



“You should know today is Jingjing’s birthday. That cake you smashed was hers. You’ve hurt her – not just me, but even Old Master Zhao won’t let you off! Think carefully about what your fate will be next!” Guan Yu scoffed disdainfully.



Jiang Ziqi’s face changed color. Given Old Master Zhao’s meticulous care and affection for Zhao Jing’er, he would never allow anyone to bully his precious granddaughter.



The consequences of bullying her – Jiang Ziqi hadn’t seriously considered them!



But would he admit it?



Jiang Ziqi feigned anger: “Guan Yu, don’t throw all your shit at me! You’re slandering me. I believe Old Master Zhao will give me justice! As for you, I’ll make you understand the severity of attacking me!”



Chapter 882: Showdown



Though the family behind Jiang Ziqi didn’t fear Old Master Zhao’s isolated faction – as the Zhao family only had frail Zhao Jing’er left who couldn’t stir major waves – Old Master Zhao remained a founding hero whose influence couldn’t be underestimated even now. Even Jiang’s family wouldn’t lightly offend him unless absolutely necessary. This was precisely why Jiang Ziqi refused to admit anything. Moreover, facing Guan Yu now, how could he lose more face? Truthfully, he’d long wanted Guan Yu dead!



Seeing Jiang’s denial, Guan Yu looked at him contemptuously: “Justice? You dare speak of justice to me? Jiang Ziqi, calling you a turtle hiding in its shell isn’t wrong! Whether you admit it or not, I’ve identified you! You made my sister cry – I’ll beat you until you weep and crawl for teeth!”



Guan Yu’s conviction came from their table’s disrupted celebration and the investigation system’s findings. Seeing Zhao Jing’er cry over the ruined cake fueled his rage. He’d make Jiang pay!



“False charges!” Jiang snarched.



BAM!



A fist smashed Jiang’s left cheek, flooring him. “Since you’ve discarded shame, I’ll rid you of that disgraceful face!” Guan Yu sneered down at him.



Jiang’s pupils constricted as Guan Yu continued: “My earlier punch wasn’t for the cake... but your assassination attempt! How could a small-town playboy like Zhan Shouwang hire professional killers without bigger backing? You’re that backer!”



After kicking Jiang across the floor, Guan Yu produced a small box: “Meet Bloodthirsty Worms. They’ll feast inside you for decades until nothing remains!” Forcing Jiang to swallow them, he watched coldly as agony wracked the man’s body.



Chapter 883: Eliminating Threats



As Jiang writhed, Guan Yu commanded the parasites through mental link. Jiang’s organs burned with unbearable pain – true suffering. Guan Yu watched impassively, showing no mercy. To him, kindness to enemies was self-cruelty. The chapter concludes with Jiang experiencing the horrific consequences of his schemes, while Guan宇 establishes absolute control through the gruesome biological warfare.
