“This is the Ancient Spirit Pill. Many of you have likely heard of it. Crafted by a high-level alchemist, it’s an Earth-tier low-grade pill. Its efficacy is widely praised—it can restore physical strength in a remarkably short time. In evenly matched battles, consuming this pill could decisively shift the balance of power!”

After her explanation, Bai Xuelan announced, “Earth-tier low-grade Ancient Spirit Pill! Starting bid: 500 gold coins. A fair price—hurry and bid!”

“500 gold coins? And they call this a *fair price*?” Guanyu’s heart sank. He recalled his last visit to Jinzhou City, where he’d frugally stretched a mere hundred gold coins over three days. Now, he realized that sum couldn’t even buy a single pill!

**Chapter 1296: The Auction**

The thought filled Guanyu with deep frustration. It seemed no matter the world, the wealthy, handsome, and privileged always lived more comfortably than the poor and ordinary.

Glancing at Huang Wensheng beside him, Guanyu mused, *This official’s son must be the legendary ‘high-society heir.’ I wonder if a 500-gold pill even interests him.*

“Well, Young Master Huang? Doesn’t a pill that rapidly restores combat power tempt you at all?”

Huang Wensheng smiled. “It’s not useless, but I possess superior alternatives. No need for this.”

“What? You have something better than Earth-tier pills?”

Guanyu concealed his astonishment. *The son of a minor city governor already hoards such treasures? This world truly runs on wealth and connections.*

“They’re not as extraordinary as you imagine—merely mid-grade Earth-tier pills. My father knows skilled alchemists, so we obtain them easily.”

“Impressive! Then why attend this auction? Could anything here catch your eye?”

Noticing Guanyu’s envy, Huang Wensheng awkwardly clarified, “These pills are basic necessities for cultivation. True treasures are rare magic crystals, high-tier techniques, or even divine artifacts from antiquity. A single such item could revolutionize one’s cultivation. What we’ve seen so far? Mere appetizers.”

“Ah… of course! I merely wished to test your knowledge, Brother Huang.” Guanyu scratched his head, feigning nonchalance. Around worldly figures like Huang, appearing ignorant would shame even himself.

Huang noticed but ignored the gesture, revealing his indifference to trivialities.

“Speaking of which, Brother Guanyu, why are *you* here? You seem disinterested in these pills.”

Guanyu chuckled conspiratorially. “Naturally—these pills are beneath my notice. I await something truly miraculous.”

“Oh? Do share—what marvel has captivated you so?”

Hearing “miraculous,” Amy leaned closer and whispered, “Dragon Brother, what treasure do you seek? Why don’t I know?”

Caught in his lie, Guanyu flushed but swiftly recovered. Tapping Amy’s forehead, he chided, “Secrets stay secret! And children shouldn’t interrupt adults. Understood?”

Rebuffed, Amy pouted and turned back to the auction, muttering, “Hmph! Keep your secrets. I’ll find out eventually!”

Meanwhile, Huang Wensheng pressed, “You still haven’t revealed this ‘miraculous thing,’ Brother Guanyu…”

“Ah… well, mysteries require mystique! Patience—you’ll see soon enough!”

Guanyu’s bravado masked his uncertainty, but Huang mercifully dropped the matter. By then, Bai Xuelan’s salesmanship had sold the Ancient Spirit Pill for 1,000 gold. Guanyu wiped sweat, thinking, *A pill Huang dismisses fetched 1,000 gold? How exorbitant will the next items be?*

His gaze shifted to the stage, where Bai Xuelan swayed forward with a white tray.

“Friends, those pills were mere preliminaries! Now begins the true auction. Anticipation thrums in the air—let’s unveil our first treasure!”

She lifted the black cloth, revealing a lumpish dark stone.

The crowd buzzed. “A *rock*? I traveled a thousand miles for this?”

“Hush! It might be precious!”

“Precious? Scam! I won’t buy it—bet it’s overpriced.”

“Calm yourselves,” Bai Xuelan purred. “True—this *is* a stone. But no ordinary one. This Flame Stone hails from a volcano’s heart.”

Gasps erupted. “Flame Stone? Essential for forging fire-attribute weapons!”

“Correct!” Bai Xuelan nodded. “Many know of fire blades like the Flame Cloud Sword—wielded only by masters or the supremely wealthy.”

After her explanation, someone shouted, “Announce the bid, Madam Bai! I’m itching!”

The man made a crude gesture, which Bai Xuelan answered with a flirtatious wave, drawing laughter.

“Very well! This Flame Stone’s starting price: 1,000 gold!”

Guanyu had anticipated this—each item’s final price matched the next’s starting bid.

**Chapter 1297: Flame Stone**

Yet the crowd’s acceptance puzzled him. Either these bidders treated 1,000 gold as pocket change, or the Flame Stone’s value justified it.

*Should I acquire a weapon?* Guanyu pondered. In life-or-death duels, superior arms tipped scales. But funds posed his true obstacle. A quality blade’s materials cost thousands—the finished product? Tens of thousands.

His heart quailed. *I must find income—fast.*

Onstage, bidding warred over the ugly stone. “2,500!” “3,000!”

A voice boomed, “5,000!”

Silence. Then: “6,000!”

The contenders: a burly, bare-chested man and an elegant noble. Guanyu stiffened—the latter was Han Yuanqing, retainer to Murong Yu, who sat nearby.

*Damn! Of all people…* Guanyu’s hands itched. That night hunting the Crystal Toad, these two had watched him nearly die to Rock’s brutality. Their smirks haunted him.

*I despise those who kick the fallen. Such ‘friends’ deserve no loyalty.*

As Guanyu plotted vengeance, bids climbed to 10,000 gold.

“You lunatic!” the burly man roared. “No one else bids—you mocking me?”

Han Yuanqing smiled. “Auction rules: bid freely. Don’t want competition? Buy from alchemists.”

The barb stung. “I’m Nantian, overlord of Yongzhou! That stone’s mine!”

“Prove it with gold.”

Tension crackled. The crowd reveled, but Bai Xuelan intervened. “Gentlemen! While precious, camaraderie matters more. Each state your final bid—highest wins.”

Her ploy masterfully pitted pride against purse. Trapped, both men shouted, “15,000!”

Gasps filled the hall. “15,000 for a stone? They could buy a Flame Cloud Sword outright!”

But Nantian smirked. “I’ve only 10,000. You’re the fool, throwing gold like dirt!”

Han Yuanqing’s composure shattered. “You… why didn’t you bid?!”

“Why bother? My coffers are modest—unlike yours, *Lord Moneybags*.”

Though livid, Han Yuanqing feigned indifference as applause erupted. Bai Xuelan crowed, “Congratulations to our buyer! 15,000 gold secures the Flame Stone!”

Guanyu spotted murderous glints in Han’s eyes—fury masked but palpable. Delight warmed him: *This is just the beginning.*

**Chapter 1298: Heaven-tier Technique**

“Next,” Bai Xuelan announced, “our fourth treasure—something extraordinary! Prepare for astonishment!”

A tattered tome appeared.

Guanyu frowned. *This is the ‘treasure’? Some moth-eaten manual?*

“Madam Bai,” a skeptic called, “is this supposed to be Earth-tier techniques?”
