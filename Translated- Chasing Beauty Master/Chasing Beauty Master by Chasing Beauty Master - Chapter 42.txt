Perhaps beaten into submission, one of the middle-aged men seized the moment when Guan Yu's group was distracted. Violently shoving aside chairs, he stumbled out the door with blood streaming down his face, fleeing in panicked desperation.

Wang Zhen snapped to attention. Grabbing a wine bottle, he charged after the escapee like an enraged bull. The fugitive hadn't even descended the restaurant steps before Wang Zhen's bottle shattered against his skull, sending him sprawling on the pavement. "You dare run from the Young Master!" Wang Zhen roared, delivering several brutal kicks to the man's head before dusting his hands with triumphant disdain.

Four battered figures now knelt in neat formation before the restaurant entrance, their drunken bravado thoroughly beaten out of them. Genuine fear shone in their eyes as they trembled before Guan Yu's group. "Dine-and-dash scum!" Guan Yu thundered. "Come begging again and we'll break your legs each time! Now crawl away!"

The quartet scrambled up like pardoned convicts, silently supporting each other through the gawking crowd. Tian Hao wiped blood from his hands, exchanging a grateful nod with Guan Yu. "Let's finish our meal," he suggested, beckoning Niu Le and Wang Zhen back inside.

"Better leave before they return with reinforcements," Wang Zhen cautioned, rubbing his knuckles.

Guan Yu's eyes flashed. "If they dare come back, we'll drop the security shutters and settle this properly." His calm tone carried steel. To Tian Hao's father, he reassured: "Uncle, we'll handle these thugs. We'll smash everything ourselves before letting them touch your shop."

The group resumed their meal with nonchalant ease, though Tian Hao and Wang Zhen exchanged uneasy glances. Guan Yu's phone shattered the tense atmosphere. Feng Xin's name flashed onscreen - why would this battle-ax of a woman call him?

"Xin-jie..." Guan Yu answered cautiously.

"Where have you been?" came the icy reprimand. "One day of bodyguard training and you vanish? Is this how you learn martial arts?"

Guan Yu coughed nervously. "School registration, Xin-jie. After military training when classes start properly, I'll—"

"Enough excuses. Where are you?" The impatience crackled through the receiver.

When the black Mercedes pulled up outside Three Liang Restaurant, Wang Zhen nearly choked on his beer. A statuesque woman emerged - white dress shirt impeccably tailored, leather shoes clicking with authority. Her glacial beauty froze the room.

"Sweet merciful... a goddess!" Wang Zhen's Adam's apple bobbed audibly.

Feng Xin marched straight to Guan Yu, thrusting shopping bags into his arms. "These are for you," she stated, her tone softening imperceptibly as she eyed his worn shirt. The trio gaped as she calmly announced: "I'm his girlfriend."

Guan Yu's protest died under her withering glare. When Niu Le blurted "But you look way older!", Feng Xin's smile turned arctic. "Age?" She tilted her chin defiantly. "Eighteen."

Beer sprayed across the table as Guan Yu choked. Wang Zhen scrambled to recover: "Y-youthful maturity! Perfect match for Guan Yu!" The temperature rose as Feng Xin joined their drinking session, her porcelain cheeks gradually flushing crimson.

"Enough," Guan Yu finally interceded as she reached for another drink. "Women shouldn't—"

"Who dares check my car?" Feng Xin's eyes flashed dangerously. "I could drive this street blindfolded!" Her finger jabbed the air, the gangster princess reemerging. Guan Yu facepalmed as his friends' eyes widened with dawning comprehension about this "girlfriend's" true background.
