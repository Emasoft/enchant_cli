After returning to Tiger Head Peak, Senior Brother Qi cautiously slipped back to his room, intending to pretend he had never left.

Rushing all the way, Chief Xiang arrived directly at Tiger Head Peak's main hall and sought out Xuanming. "Senior Sect Leader, grave news! A terrible incident has occurred!"

"What matter causes such alarm? As a chief of our sect, why do you abandon propriety?" Xuanming inquired unhurriedly.

Chief Xiang didn't even take time to sit. "Senior Sect Leader, you remember my disciple Acai, don't you?"

"Of course. That Acai from Zuokong Peak showed decent cultivation progress. What of him? Wasn't he confined by you? Did he resent the punishment?"

"No! He's dead! Torn apart in the forest!" Chief Xiang's voice quivered with suppressed sobs, his face contorted with grief.

"What? How could this happen?" Xuanming sprang to his feet. "Explain everything in detail!"

Wenming, who had accompanied Chief Xiang as an eyewitness, knelt with a thud and kowtowed. "Sect Master, Acai and I were confined in the cave when we heard noises outside. Curious, we ventured into the forest. A black-furred monster ambushed Acai from behind. I alone escaped—it drained his blood and tore him limb from limb!"

"Black-furred monster?" Xuanming's eyes blazed. "Did you see its form clearly?"

"Yes! Over two meters tall, covered in black fur, with a gaping maw of sharp fangs and enormous razor-clawed paws," Wenming described.

Xuanming frowned. Chief Xiang interjected, "Senior Sect Leader, this clearly bears the mark of the Blood Wing Technique from Black Blood Ridge. Remnants of their faction must still lurk here, daring to defy our Cloud Azure Sect!"

"Though resembling the Blood Wing Technique, this differs from Elder Jiu's previous encounter. The creature that attacked Guanyu at Front Return Peak was much shorter. They can't be the same individual."

"Senior Sect Leader! They dare strike at our doorstep! We cannot tolerate this!"

Xuanming declared decisively, "Summon all chiefs for council. Dispatch senior disciples to investigate the forest—send ample numbers to prevent further attacks."

Within an hour, Cloud Azure's chiefs assembled in Tiger Head Peak's hall. Xuanming announced, "You've heard of Zuokong Peak's tragedy. Share your insights."

Chief Lu sneered, "Serves them right! Disciples breaking confinement to die in forbidden woods? They'd deserve execution even without monster intervention!"

Chapter 3400: Reliable Intelligence

Chief Xiang sprang up, finger jabbing at Chief Lu. "Old fool! You delight in my disciple's death? However flawed, he didn't deserve this! Dare you court karma with such words?"

"Karma? At my age? I merely state facts. Had your disciples obeyed confinement, they'd be alive. This is your indulgent teaching's consequence!"

As Chief Lu left Chief Xiang speechless with rage, Xuanming mediated, "Cease quarreling! Elder Jiu confirmed the previous creature was much shorter—distinct from Wenming's account. This implies multiple infiltrators."

Chief Dai observed, "Then we harbor more than one demonic sect spy?"

Xuanming nodded gravely. "These infiltrators have lurked undetected for years. With Black Blood Ridge's destruction, they grow desperate. This brutal murder—blood-drained and dismembered—reeks of provocation."

"Blood-drained? Unusual..." Chief Zheng mused.

Xuanming frowned. "While the Blood Wing Technique's final form resembles a black-furred bat, practitioners don't require blood. This exceeds normal hatred."

Chief Xiang insisted, "I examined the body myself—shoulder bones crushed by brute strength, victim torn asunder. The blood was completely drained!"

"Such profound enmity... This runs deeper than imagined," Chief Dai remarked.

Chief Zheng stood. "Recall the Beast Poison used by Black Blood Ridge's Blood Lord to control subordinates. Without antidotes, victims transform into mindless beasts within twenty-four hours."

Xuanming added, "Junior Qi reported this—trusted agents received lethal toxins requiring periodic antidotes. The current killer likely lost their supplier after the Blood Lord's death, triggering transformation."

The assembly recalled century-old records—demonic prisoners transformed by untreated Beast Poison once massacred guards in Cloud Azure's dungeons. That incident sealed the underground prisons forever.

Chief Xiang exclaimed, "Then this beast will keep killing! We must hunt it immediately!"

Chief Mu countered, "If we avoid it, the transformed will die naturally within a day. With Black Blood Ridge destroyed and no antidote sources..."

"Not necessarily," Chief Dai interrupted. "Other demonic factions might possess this poison. We can't assume safety."

As others nodded, Xuanming sighed. "A century's peace ends. The demonic sects mobilize openly now."

Chapter 3401: Strategic Considerations

Chief Lu inquired, "Senior Sect Leader, have you learned their plans?"

Xuanming straightened. "Red Lotus Sect reports demonic forces massing near Duobao Mountain outside Qujiang City. They seek the Eight-Sided Drum."

Gasps filled the hall. All knew this immortal artifact—demonic supreme treasure. Millennia ago, Demon Ancestor Menghua cultivated using its secrets, developing godly techniques passed imperfectly to current demon lords.

Xuanming continued, "The Drum's cultivation method divides into four parts. United, they promise invincibility. We must prevent demons from obtaining them!"

"Cloud Azure must lead this intervention!" Chief Lu urged.

Xuanming nodded. "Red Lotus and True Sun already dispatched teams. As orthodox leader, we'll send our best young disciples—Guanyu's group. Their experience against Black Blood Ridge proves their capability."

Chief Xiang objected, "But Guanyu's suspected collusion with demon women! We must investigate first!"

"Then we'll await Guanyu's return tomorrow for clarification," Xuanming concluded.

Next dawn, Guanyu's group arrived at Tiger Head Peak's hall. Though Guanyu and Zhui Lang had healed, Siqi still nursed a shoulder injury.

After bowing, Guanyu immediately asked Chief Dai, "How fares Xiaotong?"

Chief Dai replied, "Awake but resting."

"Then let her testify!" Guanyu demanded, having learned of Qi's accusations during their return.

Chief Xiang sprang up, finger quivering. "Traitor! You consort with demonesses, endanger sect members, and now dare covet Xiaotong?"

Guanyu suppressed his fury, mentally cursing, "You wretched old fool! Mark my words—your comeuppance awaits."

Chief Lu interjected, "Control yourself! Discipline is the Sect Leader's purview!"

As Chief Xiang reluctantly sat, Xuanming addressed Guanyu, "Your senior brother accuses you of collusion. What say you?"

"Falsehoods! Summon Qi and Xiaotong—let truth be unveiled!" Guanyu retorted.

When Qi arrived, trembling, and Xiaotong entered supported by attendants, Guanyu gently inquired, "Senior Sister, how fare your injuries?"

Xiaotong smiled weakly. "Thanks to you all. My apologies for burdening everyone."

Chapter 3402: Eloquent Defense

Guanyu requested a seat for Xiaotong, drawing approving nods from observers. Only Qi and Chief Xiang glared.

Xuanming addressed Xiaotong, "Child, testify truthfully. What transpired at Black Blood Ridge?"

Before she could speak, Qi interjected, "Senior Sister remains confused from injury! Let me—"

"Silence!" Xuanming thundered. "Xiaotong, speak freely."

The hall tensed as all awaited her words that would determine Guanyu's fate and the sect's next course.
