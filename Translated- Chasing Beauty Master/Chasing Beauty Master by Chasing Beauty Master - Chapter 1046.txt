Feitian Lang nodded, indicating the treasure maps did bear some resemblance. "Your treasure map looks quite similar to mine," he said, "but they clearly mark different locations. Moreover, mine appears far more valuable."

"Oh? Might I inquire what Brother Wolf's treasure map looks like? Could you show it to me first?"

Immediately, Feitian Lang's face clouded with wariness. This was the other party's territory. If he produced the map now, there was a ninety percent chance he wouldn't walk out alive today. He absolutely couldn't let the other man see it.

"Apologies," Feitian Lang replied. "How could I carry such an important item on my person? If you're truly interested in buying my map, you should first demonstrate your sincerity."

**Chapter 2674: Don’t Be Hasty**

Feitian Lang rubbed his fingers together pointedly. The message was clear: If Bill Lin wanted to buy the map, he needed to put down a deposit first. Only after payment would he show the map, with the remaining sum settled in full afterward.

"Brother Wolf," Bill Lin said, displeasure evident, "I showed you my maps without hesitation. Isn't this approach rather... uncouth? I'm offering genuine sincerity to purchase your item, yet you won't even let me glance at it before demanding payment. This seems..."

"Caution preserves longevity," Feitian Lang retorted coldly. "This being our first transaction, my distrust is natural. Conversely, if you distrust me, feel free to walk away. I'll simply auction it elsewhere. Even if it sells for less, that's preferable to being swindled here."

Though his logic held merit, Bill Lin was no fool. Feitian Lang ranked among the Ten Great Villains—a man capable of any atrocity. Paying upfront risked the scoundrel absconding with the money.

"Even auctions carry dangers," Bill Lin countered. "That venue poses greater risks than my premises. Aren't you afraid of being ambushed? Countless parties covet that map. Moreover, do you truly believe the auction price would exceed my offer?"

"If you wish to buy, you follow my terms. Otherwise, this discussion ends here." Feitian Lang's voice turned icy.

Seeing no alternative, Bill Lin attempted persuasion: "Brother Wolf, should this transaction succeed, I may require your assistance frequently in the future. Naturally, I'll provide generous compensation. With ongoing collaboration, why would I sabotage you now?"

"I've been a villain for years. My rules are absolute," Feitian Lang declared, rising abruptly. "I'd rather lose profit at auction than risk deception here. If my terms displease you, I take my leave."

As he turned to depart, Bill Lin hastily intercepted him. "Brother Wolf, don't be hasty! Negotiations require thorough discussion. I'm considering your interests. If showing the map is impossible, perhaps a photograph? Otherwise, how can I trust this isn't a bluff?"

"Very well." Feitian Lang produced his phone. "I happen to have photos here. Inspect them if you wish."

Sliding the device across the table, he waited. Bill Lin picked it up, examining an image of a treasure map. While the depicted markings differed, the material quality appeared identical to his own fragments.

Returning the phone, Bill Lin proposed: "I'll advance one million now. The remaining fourteen million upon exchange—map for payment. Agreed?"

"Accepted. I'll notify you of the exchange location later." Resuming his seat, Feitian Lang added, "I seek honest sale. When I troubled Guan Yu for this map, my sole aim was profit. Since you're buying, I'll sell. Rest assured—once paid, I'll play no tricks. You have my word."

Leaning forward, he emphasized: "I could sell to others, but none match your offer. I only hope your purchase intent proves equally genuine."

"My sincerity is evident," Bill Lin snapped. "Why else waste time here? Now, another matter—how did you obtain the map from Houyuan Temple? Those meddlesome monks are Guan Yu's allies. They wouldn't relinquish it easily."

Feitian Lang smirked. "Simple enough. A minor stratagem sufficed. Moreover, Guan Yu seemed eager to be rid of the map. He surrendered it with minimal resistance."

"Truly?" Bill Lin's skepticism showed. Having suffered Guan Yu's cunning firsthand, he found this account improbable. "Why would he yield such a valuable item so readily?"

"The map's a liability," Feitian Lang explained. "Guan Yu recognized it as a ticking bomb—attracting enemies wherever it goes. Initially thrilled, I soon realized its peril. Carrying it invites assassins and opportunists alike."

Bill Lin's jaw tightened. This map should have been his! Instead, Feitian Lang seized it first. His subsequent failed retrieval attempt cost thirty million in extortion and hundreds of injured men—utter disaster.

Recalling Guan Yu's claim about Feitian Lang stealing the map, Bill Lin now saw its truth. "Are you aware," he asked pointedly, "of my profound enmity with Guan Yu?"

"Unrelated to my sale," Feitian Lang shrugged. "I know only your family's immense wealth. The Bill Clan's global reputation for affluence made you the ideal buyer."

Bill Lin's smile returned. "You chose correctly. Only I possess the resources to complete the full map. Others lack such capacity—even martial experts. My advantage is capital."

"While I won't endorse your words," Feitian Lang conceded, "I can't deny reality. Modern endeavors require money. Without it, nothing gets done."

"Having crossed Guan Yu for this map," Bill Lin pressed, "he'll surely seek vengeance. Consider collaborating with me against him." His tone turned conspiratorial.

**Chapter 2675: Priceless Treasure**

Though tempted, Feitian Lang hesitated. Guan Yu's retaliation remained uncertain, and he wished no part in their feud.

Shaking his head, he refused: "I understand your rivalry, Young Master Bill, but I'll not involve myself. My sole aim is selling this map, then retiring far from Jianghu's bloodshed. I'm weary of conflict."

Bill Lin masked surprise at this timidity. "Brother Wolf, can fifteen million truly sustain your retirement? Your aspirations seem... modest."

"For me, it's substantial," Feitian Lang countered. "Greater wealth demands greater risks. I value my life too much. Given even your mighty clan struggles against Guan Yu, adding one villain changes little. The endeavor reeks of danger."

Seeking leverage, Bill Lin upped his offer: "Your martial prowess intrigues me. Aid me against Guan Yu, and I'll add twenty million post-victory. Thirty-five million total—enough for luxury anywhere. Isn't that preferable?"

The figure gave Feitian Lang pause. Such wealth might justify risk. "I... need time to consider. Let's complete our current transaction first."

"Come now, Brother Wolf!" Bill Lin pressed. "Immediate agreement ensures smoother collaboration!"

Internally cursing, Feitian Lang recognized the ultimatum: refusal might sabotage the sale. With Bill Lin aware of the map, escape seemed impossible. Reluctantly, he yielded: "Very well. I'll cooperate—but only with absolute safety guarantees."

"Excellent!" Bill Lin beamed. "Your assistance honors me. Now, retrieve the map. This partnership begins splendidly!"

Though cunning, Bill Lin intended no deception here. Fifteen million meant little compared to the map's value. Legends spoke of unimaginable riches—a fortune spanning generations.

Originally negotiating one million upfront, Bill Lin now impulsively transferred five million. Feitian Lang then led the entourage to his residence.

Contrary to expectations, the map fragment wasn't hidden in some secure vault. Feitian Lang retrieved it from within his pillow. Unzipping the casing, he handed it over. "Inspect it. This is what I took from Guan Yu."

Bill Lin's grin stretched ear-to-ear as he accepted it. "Bold storage choice, Brother Wolf! Weren't you afraid of theft?"

"Axioms hold truth—the riskiest spot proves safest," Feitian Lang sighed. "Normally, I carry it daily. But for our first deal, I left it here. Had things gone awry today..."

He yanked open a nearby drawer, revealing a ticking time bomb. Bill Lin paled.

"Fear not," Feitian Lang assured, snipping a yellow wire. The beeping ceased. "Twelve hours remained. Deactivated now."

Bill Lin wiped cold sweat. "Extreme precautions! Fortunately, our deal succeeded. The remaining ten million will reach your account within 24 hours. To celebrate, let me treat you tonight!"

Nodding, Feitian Lang recognized temporary safety through mutual interests. Yet he added: "Young Master Bill, one request."

"Speak freely! Between brothers, no need for formality."

"Now that our transaction concludes, please spread word you've bought the map. This protects my future movements. Many still seek to kill me for it..."

**Chapter 2676: Right-Hand Men**

The concern held weight. Collaborating against Guan Yu required Feitian Lang's public presence. Only by attributing the map to the formidable Bill Clan could he walk safely—few would dare challenge such a power.

"Understood," Bill Lin agreed readily. "For smooth cooperation, I'll release the news immediately. Remain here briefly while we strategize against Guan Yu."

As their pact solidified, another player stirred—Fang Su.

Upon learning of Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu's grim fates, Fang Su fled abroad, terrified of Guan Yu's retribution. Though hiding overseas, he maintained covert contact with Bill Lin, plotting remotely.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu sat across from Patriarch Yang, playing chess on the eve of the Yang Clan's auction.

"Have you heard?" The old patriarch moved a piece. "Feitian Lang sold his map fragment to Bill Lin. Credible?"

"Likely true," Guan Yu replied. "Feitian Lang's recent bold movements suggest he's divested the map. Bill Lin's wealth makes him the sole plausible buyer."

"Precisely," the patriarch nodded. "Bill Lin's publicity about the acquisition is telling—normally, one conceals such fortune. Their collusion seems certain. Remember: Bill Lin's goals here are twofold—the map and your destruction."

Guan Yu smiled grimly. "Let them come. United, they merely present two enemies to vanquish instead of one."
