“Dad, you… how could you trick someone like this! Where did you get the counterfeit money?” The chubby boy stared at his father in astonishment, his voice low with disbelief.

“I… I… This money was given by Li Quezi (Li the Cripple) and his gang when they ate here yesterday! Three hundred yuan total, all three bills fake. I…”

“You didn’t notice at the time?!”

“I did notice! But would that bastard have exchanged them for me? If he got angry, he’d just smash my shop with his thugs. Our family’s future… Forget it! I’ll take the loss. I’ll burn this cursed money!” The shop owner sighed bitterly, pulling out a lighter and setting the bills aflame.

Guan Yu tilted his head, listening to the father-son exchange. The gist was clear: a customer named Li Quezi had paid with counterfeit bills. This “Crippled Li” likely held some power here, someone nobody dared cross.

Back in his hometown, Guan Yu had seen plenty like him—bullies preying on the meek while avoiding those with fiery tempers. Such village ruffians only respected those who stood firm or instilled fear. Otherwise, they’d walk all over you.

“What? That bastard again? I told you before! To deal with scum like Li Quezi, damn it, you gotta chop him up! Break his other leg so he’ll ride a wheelchair forever. Let’s see him bully people then!” The stocky boy glared fiercely, fists clenched in outrage.

“Quiet! Don’t provoke him. Losing a few hundred yuan… Let them bully me. Once you graduate and get a good job, you won’t have to run this shop and suffer like me!” The father gripped his son’s arm urgently.

“What? Fighting? Chopping people? Need help?” The towering young man’s eyes lit up as he thumped his chest eagerly.

Guan Yu watched them wryly but stayed silent.

“Check, please!” Guan Yu set down his chopsticks softly.

“No charge… It’s free!” The shop owner insisted, grateful Guan Yu had prevented a brawl earlier.

Guan Yu placed cash on the table and led Du Xiaojuan out by the arm.

“Hey…” The tall youth called out, but Guan Yu exited without a backward glance.

“That… that guy’s alright,” the tall one muttered, watching Guan Yu leave with a grin. No one ever stood up for him before. Guan Yu’s intervention had genuinely moved him.

Unaware that these two would later become his most loyal allies, Guan Yu dismissed them as mere passersby. With Du Xiaojuan in tow, he couldn’t retrieve his suitcase from his sister-in-law or practice at Old Kang’s. They returned to the hostel and sat on the bed’s edge.

“What was that mysterious thing you wanted to say earlier?” Guan Yu sniffed, pulse quickening. Was she about to confess feelings?

“Nothing, really. I just… enjoy being with you.” Du Xiaojuan blushed, her voice barely audible.

Guan Yu’s heart skipped. Was this leading where he hoped?

“But… we’ll have to meet secretly now. My aunt forbids me from seeing you. She thinks you’ll take advantage of me.” She sighed mournfully, gazing at him sideways.

“How would I take advantage?” Guan Yu frowned, baffled.

“I… I accidentally told her we kissed! She knows now!”

Guan Yu gaped. Since when did adults report such things to family?

“Senior, you’re joking… You told people about that?!”

“It slipped out during an argument with her!” Du Xiaojuan pouted defensively.

Chapter 85: Do You Still Want to Kiss Me?

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Her naivety exasperated him. Since when did kissing require parental oversight?

“What did your aunt say?”

“She said… you’ve blinded me with sweet talk! That if I stay with you, you’ll trick me into bed!”

“What the hell? Am I that shameless?!” Guan Yu flushed angrily. Though he harbored desires, he’d never act without mutual feelings. To him, intimacy required emotional bonds—anything else was bestial. If he’d wanted casual flings, he wouldn’t still be a virgin after years among street toughs. This slander outraged his self-image as a principled young man. Unforgivable!

“Don’t be mad! I’ll stop telling her anything. We’ll keep it quiet!” Du Xiaojuan pleaded, watching him anxiously.

“Why sneak around? You’re an adult! We’re just friends—what’s shameful about that?”

“I… I can’t argue with her!” She wrung her hands helplessly.

“This isn’t about arguing! Why must we act like secret lovers?”

“I don’t know… Are we just friends?” Her wide eyes searched his face.

Guan Yu faltered. What else could they be?

“Don’t look at me like that!” She tugged his sleeve, flustered. “Friends don’t kiss… And you’ve seen me… down there.”

Guan Yu flushed, cornered. Their relationship defied labels—more than friends, less than lovers.

“I’m confused too!” He admitted weakly.

“Then I’ll call you secretly from now on!” She whispered conspiratorially, though they were alone.

“Fine!” Guan Yu surrendered.

Pleased, she dimpled. “Our little secret. Oh, and… do you still want to kiss me?”

Before he could react, her lips met his in a sweet, breathless rush. Guan Yu’s arms encircled her, pressing her into the mattress as he deepened the kiss. His hands roamed her blouse, cupping her breasts greedily. Damn consequences—she clearly wanted this!

Hiking her skirt to her waist, he marveled at her thighs. “Let me see…” He knelt between her legs, drinking in the view.

White cotton panties hid her secrets, but a faint damp spot betrayed her arousal. “What’s this…” He pressed the slight swell above her mound.

“Stop!” She squirmed, rolling sideways—revealing pale, rounded buttocks. Guan Yu’s breath hitched. He squeezed the supple flesh, mesmerized by its resilience.

“Just looking, okay? Don’t… don’t go further!” She pleaded, covering her face.

“I won’t hurt you.”

“I trust you.” She smiled shyly beneath her hands.

His fingers traced her dampening panties. “Does this feel good?”

“N-no… It’s too much!” Her hips jerked involuntarily.

Confused—weren’t women supposed to enjoy this?—he withdrew. Though aching, he couldn’t exploit her innocence. She trusted him utterly. If he couldn’t promise forever, he wouldn’t take her now.

Crushing her to his chest, he inhaled her floral scent. “You smell amazing…”

Giggling, she nuzzled him. “I love your smell too. Holding you like this… I’m so happy.”

“Will you still hold me like this… later?” Her eyes searched his.

“You’ll have a husband for that someday.”

“I don’t want anyone else! Just you!” Her childlike earnestness warmed him.

“But I’ve got nothing to offer.”

“Having you is enough. We’ll work hard together!” She beamed. “As long as we’re happy, nothing else matters. You’ll always treat me well, right?”

Guilt pricked him as her innocence contrasted with his groping. “You’re too idealistic. Handsome, rich men—”

She bit his chest playfully. “I don’t care! I’ll follow you forever!”

He chuckled, stroking her cheek. “Men are all bad, huh?”

“Except you!” She amended quickly. “My aunt says men only want to see your chest and… down there. But you’re different!”

Guan Yu winced—he’d done both. Yet she clung to him, believing his restraint. Could he honor that trust?

Chapter 86: The Diva

As their whispers faded, Du Xiaojuan glanced at the clock. “Let me take you somewhere fun this afternoon!” Her eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration.
