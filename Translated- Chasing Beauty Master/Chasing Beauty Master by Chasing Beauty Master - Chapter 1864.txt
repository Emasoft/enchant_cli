“Putting on an act, are you?” Patriarch Qin pointed at Qu Hua and said: “I’ve investigated everything thoroughly. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have dragged you here in the dead of night. If you persist in denying it here, I believe you’ll soon savor the taste of torture. Coddled since childhood in our Qin household, I doubt you’ve ever experienced such sensations.”

Patriarch Qin’s gnashing declaration sent chills through not only Qu Hua but also the onlookers beyond the door. Everyone’s pores prickled with discomfort, for the Qin servants had always feared their stern patriarch most—a man renowned for his unyielding severity.

Qin Huan thought this approach unnecessary. Matters ought to be clarified first. Otherwise, beating Qu Hua half-dead would render any interrogation futile.

“Qu Hua,” Qin Huan thundered, “Haven’t I treated you well all these years? Whatever I possessed, I shared with you. The Qin family raised you, yet instead of gratitude, you commit this vile treachery—embezzling our silver! You’re courting death!”

Qu Hua remained silent, slanting a sidelong glance at Qin Huan while inwardly cursing: *Bullshit about treating me well! True, the Qins raised me, and you played the generous cousin—but you always claimed the choicest goods and toys first. Only your castoffs ever reached me.* Years of repressed resentment simmered within him, unvoiced. Were it not for Madame Qin’s constant pampering and lavish allowances, Qu Hua would have rebelled long ago.

“Qu Hua,” Qin Huan pressed, “Who transported the goods unloaded at Black Gate Manor?”

Abandoning pretense, Qu Hua stood motionless with bowed head. Truthfully, even he didn’t know the identities behind this scheme.

He remembered that fateful encounter at Wanyang Tavern—a vision of beauty named Xiao Shao who resembled his dream goddess. Enthralled, Qu Hua’s latent resentment toward the Qins crystallized into action. Though aware of his own inadequacies and financial dependence on the family, Madame Qin’s allowances (squandered as always) bound him to complacency.

After meeting Xiao Shao, Qu Hua became obsessed. Days of lavish spending drained his coffers, yet she remained aloof—permitting only the briefest hand contact. Finally, she proposed: to possess her, Qu Hua needed courage and silver. Her scheme involved diverting shipments—unloading portions at Black Gate Manor before official delivery, then selling the surplus elsewhere. Profits would be split equally.

Enticed by dual gains of wealth and romance, Qu Hua agreed without hesitation. Overseeing the fishing village shipments provided perfect cover. Thus began his irreversible descent—each Black Gate diversion swelling his secret coffers with effortless gains.

When Xiao Shao’s recent absences bred unease, Qu Hua resolved to cease after a few more transactions. Yet his tavern brawl and subsequent injuries delayed this plan—until Patriarch Qin’s discovery.

“Do you think silence protects you?” Qin Huan demanded. “The accounts you managed show glaring discrepancies. Only a fool would miss them. But I know you lack the wit to devise this alone. Black Gate Manor isn’t your territory. Speak—who instructed you?”

**Chapter 4900: Mercy**

Truthfully, Qin Huan hadn’t disliked Qu Hua. The latter’s presence amused like a pampered pet—until this betrayal. Now, even silence couldn’t save him.

Qu Hua maintained muteness. Naming Xiao Shao proved futile—her origins and affiliations remained mysterious.

“Bring the implements! Bind him!” Patriarch Qin barked impatiently. Midnight permitted no delays.

Soon, men carried in a massive frame. Strapped upright to a long bench, Qu Hua trembled as Patriarch Qin ordered: “Show him colors.”

Two men raised his legs, inserting a five-centimeter plank beneath. Agonized screams erupted as sweat drenched Qu Hua. Unaccustomed to pain, he crumpled immediately: “Mercy, Uncle! I’ll talk! Spare me!”

“Did you think my threats empty? Expecting your aunt’s rescue? Delusional!” Patriarch Qin sneered. “Name your conspirator!”

“Xiao Shao...from Wanyang Tavern...she made me do it!” Qu Hua gasped through tears. “That vixen bewitched me!”

**Chapter 4901: Pleading**

“Xiao Shao?” Qin Huan frowned. “Unknown lineage. Which clan?”

“I never asked!” Qu Hua panted, weakened by injuries old and new. “Only desired her beauty!”

“Ignorance excuses nothing!” Patriarch Qin roared. “Break his leg!”

As a hammer-wielding guard approached, Qu Hua fainted. The sickening *crack* of bone roused him to a final scream before unconsciousness.

“Revive him!” Patriarch Qin commanded, making spectacle of this lesson. A water dousing stirred Qu Hua to groggy awareness.

“Xiao Shao’s identity!” demanded the patriarch.

“Truly...unknown...” Qu Hua slurred. “Spare me...”

“Break the other leg!”

Madame Qin’s shriek interrupted: “STOP!” Stumbling in, she cradled Qu Hua’s broken form. “What crime justifies this?”

“Remove her!” Patriarch Qin thundered, though guards hesitated before the matriarch.

Qin Huan intervened, presenting account books: “Mother, he diverted fishing village shipments—colluding with outsiders to embezzle. Evidence and witnesses confirm it.”

Madame Qin trembled. “Impossible! He’s mischievous, not treasonous!”

“Your cursed nephew shames both Qins and Qus!” Patriarch Qin spat. “The Qu line deserves extinction!”

As Madame Qin wept over Qu Hua, Qin Huan proposed: “Perhaps coerced? Let Mother question him.”

The desperate matriarch shook Qu Hua: “Say you were forced!”

But Qu Hua drifted beyond coherence. Qin Huan suggested confinement for later interrogation. Reluctantly, Patriarch Qin agreed: “Guard him closely! Escape means your heads!”

Dawn found Patriarch Qin strategizing with Qin Huan: “Dispatch the next fishing village shipment normally. Surveil Black Gate Manor—flush out this Xiao Shao.”

“I’ll investigate Wanyang Tavern too,” Qin Huan nodded. With household chaos consuming them, retribution against Guan Yu—Qu Hua’s tavern assailant—faded from priority. The disgraced nephew’s survival now hung by threads thinner than spider-silk.
