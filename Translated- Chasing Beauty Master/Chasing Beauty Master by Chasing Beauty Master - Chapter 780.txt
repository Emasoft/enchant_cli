Jones waved her hand, signaling her subordinates to stop and withdraw. After they had all retreated, she fixed her gaze on Guan Yu and slowly walked toward him.

“Do you really not remember me?” she asked, her voice trembling. “Can’t you recall anything? During those days living in the ice cavern, I thought of you every moment. Finally, I couldn’t bear it any longer and came out to find you.”

Tears streamed down Jones’s face as she approached Guan Yu. “The five little bears miss you too,” she whispered. Guan Yu stared at the woman before him.

She was beautiful—an indescribable beauty, a blend of mixed-ethnic charm distinct from the elegance of Huaxia women. Her porcelain-white skin glowed under the light, her flawless features perfectly arranged on a delicate oval face. Her figure was slender yet curvaceous, exuding an enchanting aura reminiscent of Bai Jiao. Such a woman could captivate any man.

Jones finally broke down, sobbing loudly. “Guan Yu, I’m Jones!” Her shoulders shook as she covered her mouth with delicate hands, stifling her cries.

At the sound of her name, Guan Yu’s mind raced through memories like a film reel.

“So it’s you! Jones!” Guan Yu exclaimed in astonishment. He hadn’t recalled her from their farewell in the ice cavern but from what Xue Jing had later told him.

Hearing Guan Yu speak her name, Jones collapsed, her legs giving way as she crouched and wept.

“Sister, what’s wrong?” Lan Yu, who had taken a liking to Jones, rushed to comfort her. “Don’t cry. You’re too pretty to cry.”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected the woman before him to be Jones. Though his memories of her were faint, he knew she was once his woman.

Helpless, Guan Yu bent down, gently helped Jones to her feet, and embraced her. “I’m sorry. This is all my fault,” he murmured.

Lan Yu finally understood—this wasn’t another “sister” but a new addition to their circle.

Unsure how to console Jones, Guan Yu called Xue Jing, urging her to come quickly and bring Amei and Zhang Han for protection.

Jones recounted her journey after leaving the ice cavern. Guan Yu listened with awe. From a fragile girl, she had transformed into a formidable woman, driven to prove she was no longer the naive girl abandoned in the ice. Through relentless cultivation, she’d absorbed the purest spiritual energy between heaven and earth.

In a remarkably short time, she’d become a true master, now just one step away from the peak of the Realm Sovereign. Yet each attempt to cross that threshold summoned Guan Yu’s phantom, distracting her to near-fatal consequences. Unable to endure, she’d left to find him, only to linger in the shadows, fearing her presence would disrupt his life.

Determined to build her own power, she joined a small异能者organization. Her beauty attracted the leader’s unwanted advances, but when he tried to force himself on her, Jones—underestimating her own strength—left him vegetative. The group, awed by her power and beauty, made her their new leader.

Though admirers flocked to her organization, Jones’s heart remained devoted to Guan Yu alone.

As Guan Yu listened, guilt gnawed at him. Abandoning her in that ice cavern was his greatest failure. Even Lan Yu was moved by Jones’s tragic tale.

When Xue Jing arrived with Amei and Zhang Han, Jones wiped her tears and smiled brightly. “Jingjing, my Ice Goddess! It’s been too long.”

Xue Jing stared in shock before recognizing Jones’s mannerisms. “Jones! How have you changed so much?”

The two women embraced joyfully.

“My appearance?” Jones mused. “The ice cavern’s environment and spiritual energy must have altered me. My skin turned this pale, and my features shifted slightly.”

“Oh! The five little bears miss you terribly,” Jones added.

“You brought them here?” Xue Jing lit up.

“Only temporarily. They disliked the climate, so I returned them. But they’re the only five异能者bears in existence! If we call from the North Pole, they’ll come. I visit them often.”

**Chapter 1979: Sunbathing**

No one anticipated Jones’s arrival or her dramatic reunion with Guan Yu. Xue Jing suggested adjourning for the night, but Guan Yu refused.

“Sun Xu!” Guan Yu growled the name like a curse, murder in his eyes.

But with his “family” in tow, revenge would wait. After notifying Mr. Lan of Lan Yu’s safety, Guan Yu tried sending her home.

Lan Yu rebelled. “I know you have many women,” she declared publicly, “but I’m yours too! You can’t keep ignoring me forever!”

Guan Yu froze, unprepared for this outburst. Zhang Han slithered into his arms, taunting, “Uncle, let’s go home and sleep.”

Ignoring the provocation, Lan Yu demanded answers. “If I’m destined for the cold palace, so be it. But tell me!”

“Don’t be absurd,” Guan Yu soothed. “I’ve just been busy lately.”

“Liar!” Zhang Han interjected. “You sleep with Jing-jie and Mei-mei every night! Last time you went to Auntie’s room and made her scream all night!”

“Enough!” Xue Jing silenced her.

Guan Yu sighed. “Lan Yu, if you feel neglected, move to Qiaoyuan District. That might feel fairer.”

Knowing true fairness was impossible, Lan Yu shook her head. “Just… remember me sometimes.”

After Mr. Lan collected his daughter, Guan Yu turned to Sun Xu’s demise. Jones had provided his location, but nightfall stayed Guan Yu’s hand.

**Chapter 1980: No Mercy**

Next morning, Guan Yu summoned Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo to campus woods. “Sun Xu hired异能者to kidnap Lan Yu,” he revealed.

The duo gasped. “We’ll dismantle the Gentleman’s Hall today,” Guan Yu declared. “Spread the word: dissolve the group. Anyone still claiming membership gets punished. Yu Gang won’t accept them.”

As his lieutenants mobilized, Guan Yu stormed Sun Xu’s luxury hotel suite, where异能者guards stepped aside at Jones’s order.

Sun Xu, fresh from showering, flung open the door expecting his kidnapped prize. Instead, Guan Yu’s kick sent him flying.

The ensuing beating left Sun Xu a bloody pulp on imported wool carpet. Dragged naked through the lobby and dumped outside with “BEAST” plastered on his chest, Sun Xu became a public spectacle.

Later, learning Wei Hongwei’s group faced resistance on campus, Guan Yu accelerated his Hummer toward the confrontation. Spotring the ringleader Xiao Gen, he floored the gas.

In a life-saving leap, Xiao Gen clung to a tree three meters away—only for Guan Yu’s thrown dagger to pin his hand to the trunk.

“Five seconds,” Guan Yu coldly counted down. When Xiao Gen stayed put, the silver blade found its mark.

“MY HAND!” Xiao Gen wailed, dangling grotesquely as onlookers recoiled.

“Damn,” Wei Hongwei muttered in awe. “Boss doesn’t hold back.”
