Guan Yu never engaged in unprofitable ventures. Today, standing here with only a woman by his side, encircled by over fifty people yet showing no trace of fear, he trusted that hidden experts lurked in the shadows to protect them.

After some deliberation, Bill Lin concluded today was ill-suited for conflict. Two reasons prevailed: first, in this terrain, Guan Yu held every advantage of timing, location, and manpower, leaving Bill Lin at a severe disadvantage. Second, Bill Lin’s lingering obsession with Shuangshuang compelled him to maintain his gentlemanly facade in her presence.

“Shuangshuang, you see—I’ve brought so many people here carrying flowers, not weapons. I’ve come not to pick a fight but to sincerely court you. Can’t you grant me even one chance?” Bill Lin persisted shamelessly, clinging to a sliver of hope.

Shuangshuang shot him a disdainful glare, her playful smile vanishing. “Earlier, I merely found you irritating. Now you disgust me. Do you not understand Mandarin, or have I spoken unclearly? Save your efforts. We’re impossible because my heart belongs solely to Big Brother. Is that clear enough?”

Bill Lin’s face flushed crimson to his neck. Never in his life had he suffered such humiliation. Since birth, he’d been coddled by throngs of women. From childhood,同龄 girls surrounded him as playmates, and as he matured, women of any type became easily attainable.

Even after joining the Feng Family, he’d never faced rejection. Any woman he fancied would yield for the right price, and those resistant succumbed to threats. Only upon encountering the women of Qiaoyuan District did he realize true beauty’s rarity.

Learning of Shuangshuang days prior, Bill Lin became consumed, losing sleep over schemes to possess her. Knowing Guan Yu protected her and that Kaihuang Academy served as the Yu Faction’s stronghold made claiming her here nearly impossible.

After much deliberation, Bill Lin settled on a softer approach, leading to today’s events. Guan Yu’s arrival was anticipated—without him, Shuangshuang wouldn’t have appeared. Bill Lin had genuinely believed Shuangshuang was merely Guan Yu’s sister, confident his status and charm would win her. Instead, she treated him worse than a stray dog.

Any girl witnessing such a grand romantic gesture should feel moved, yet Shuangshuang rejected him outright, denying even a sliver of hope. The ultimate humiliation came with realizing she wasn’t Guan Yu’s sister but his kept woman.

**Chapter 2914: Grave Consequences**

Though seething with resentment, Bill Lin found himself powerless. This humiliating defeat marked his first failed romantic pursuit. With soft tactics futile, he shifted strategies. “Since Miss Shuangshuang remains unwilling, I’ll take my leave. But now, Guan Yu—how shameless to claim her as your sister when she’s clearly your mistress! Isn’t your harem at home enough? Must you keep little girls outside too?”

Bill Lin aimed to provoke Xue Jing’s reaction, hoping to embarrass Guan Yu.

Guan Yu retorted, “My affairs are none of your concern. If I choose to keep every woman worldwide as mistresses, it’s because I possess the charm and wealth to do so. What’s it to you?”

Matching Bill Lin’s audacity, Guan Yu added, “Perhaps I’m thick-skinned, but at least I’m not despicable.”

Xue Jing overheard but remained unmoved. Even if Guan Yu and Shuangshuang were involved, she wouldn’t bat an eye. From their first meeting, Xue Jing had known Shuangshuang would inevitably become Guan Yu’s. Such a stunning girl deserved him—any other outcome would be a waste.

Though Guan Yu feigned indifference and avoided Shuangshuang, her relentless pursuit left little doubt. She simmered in his pot, a delicacy awaiting consumption.

Bill Lin’s attempts to sow discord failed. Undeterred, he jeered, “Guan Yu, aren’t you too old to be keeping an underage schoolgirl? Imagine the scandal if this spreads!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Do you think such baseless claims anger me? Whether Shuangshuang is mine or not, stay away. Harm a single hair on her head, and I’ll hunt you to the ends of the earth.”

His threat delivered, Guan Yu trusted Bill Lin would weigh the consequences. With Shuangshuang alone at risk in the chaotic academy, even Yu Faction protection couldn’t guarantee absolute safety. A warning was necessary.

Bill Lin glared venomously but dared no action. “Consider today a wasted trip. Let’s go.”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected Bill Lin to retreat so easily with fifty cultivators in tow. He’d prepared countermeasures, aware Xue Jing couldn’t protect both him and Shuangshuang against such numbers. Perhaps repeated defeats had taught Bill Lin caution—recognizing Guan Yu’s superiority, he chose retreat.

As Bill Lin departed, Guan Yu shouted, “Did you send Sun Xu?” Bill Lin paused. “Figure it out yourself.”

Though expecting lies, Guan Yu sought any clue. With Bill Lin gone, the campus gates quieted. Spectators dispersed, disappointed the anticipated clash ended in the intruders’ cowardly retreat. Guan Yu’s legend grew—two women by his side had routed fifty men.

News exploded across the school network, skyrocketing Guan Yu’s reputation.

Shuangshuang asked, “Big Brother, how did you know someone would confess to me? Why’d you come so fast?”

Guan Yu hesitated. Admitting constant surveillance felt too direct; claiming jealousy over rivals was worse. “I tracked Bill Lin. Knowing he came here, I rushed to protect you.”

Uncertain of his own feelings, Guan Yu wondered—if Shuangshuang accepted another, would he approve? She persistently clarified their relationship wasn’t sibling-like, yet he delayed acceptance, using aid as pretext.

“Didn’t you miss me? Those roses almost swayed my heart,” Shuangshuang pouted.

Guan Yu sighed at her antics. “Of course I missed you. And congratulations on topping your department! I’m proud.”

**Chapter 2915: Patience**

“Grades are trivial. Visit more often, and I’ll ace every test.”

Guan Yu deflected, “Your mother mustn’t know yet! I’ll tell her—she’ll be thrilled.”

“She knows. I called her first. She was happy but… accustomed to my first-place streaks. It’s mundane now.”

Guan Yu marveled—others coveted top ranks, yet Shuangshuang treated them as routine.

Xue Jing suggested, “Hungry? Let’s grab KFC.”

“I ate. Class soon. Go without me.” Shuangshuang waved, joining friends.

“Call me if trouble arises,” Guan Yu reminded.

Bill Lin stormed home, fuming. “Guan Yu, I’ll destroy you!”

Poison Widow, noting his rage, soothed, “Patience. Our next move will cripple him.”

Bill Lin recalled their scheme. “How’s the plan progressing?”

Sun Xu, wheelchair-bound, reported, “Guan Yu remains cautious, but my contacts in the leather factory smuggled products undetected.”

“Good. Let his arrogance blind him. Once complacent, we strike,” Poison Widow said.

Sun Xu proposed, “Plant clients to expose shortages. Repeated penalties will bankrupt them.”

Bill Lin agreed but needed the Feng heir’s connections.

Poison Widow added, “I met Ma Tong. He still avoids conflict but agreed to a pact.”

Bill Lin pressed, “Details?”

“He’ll remain neutral but won’t interfere. His casino overshadows Yu Faction’s nearby venues. Guan Yu’s men already monitor his earnings.”

**Chapter 2916: Business Wars**

Ma Tong’s casino, converted from a bathhouse, dominated the North District’s entertainment strip, dwarfing Yu Faction’s revived bar and spa. Ge Yinglai, recovering abroad after Guan Yu severed his tendons, had left his establishments struggling.

Ma Tong preferred neutrality but knew coexistence was temporary. Letting Guan Yu and Bill Lin battle bought him time. Yet with Yu Faction members frequenting his casino, tensions brewed. Profit margins dipped as rivals encroached—a problem demanding resolution.
