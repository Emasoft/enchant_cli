“Father, all you ever think about are those tedious plans of yours—success or failure. But have any of your schemes ever succeeded when I’m around?” Wang Xiaorong retorted impatiently. “But anyway, I’m in a splendid mood today. What’s it to you?”

Wang Xiaorong’s mind was wholly occupied by Guanyu, leaving no room for idle chatter or trivial matters.

The Demon Lord had to concede the point. Wherever Wang Xiaorong appeared, his plans inevitably crumbled. If she refrained from outright sabotage, it was already a blessing.

“My thoughts revolve around vital affairs, while yours dwell on frivolities. Naturally, we share no common ground. Besides,” the Demon Lord sighed wearily, “you’re grown now. I can’t watch over you forever.” The weight of managing the Soul Devourer Sect’s internal and external affairs while enduring his daughter’s reproach left him at a loss.

“Father,” Wang Xiaorong pressed, “could you spare a thought for my feelings? Must every conversation be about missions and strategies? It’s suffocating!”

“Very well,” the Demon Lord relented, his indulgence for his daughter boundless. “I’ll set aside more time to accompany you henceforth.” So long as her whims didn’t jeopardize greater schemes, he would grant her every wish—a habit that had nurtured her capricious “little demoness” temperament.

“Then tell me,” he urged, “what has put you in such high spirits today?”

“I shan’t tell you!” Wang Xiaorong giggled mischievously. She would never reveal her entanglement with Guanyu—not yet, at least.

As the Demon Lord opened his mouth to press further, the Azure Dragon Left Envoy entered. “Young Mistress, you returned early? I searched Cloud Azure Gate for you, fearing you’d wandered off elsewhere.”

Following him came Steward Sun and the fox demoness, who paid their respects to the Demon Lord.

“I’ve been perfectly obedient!” Wang Xiaorong chirped innocently. “No trouble at all!”

“Report,” the Demon Lord commanded. “What transpired at Cloud Azure Gate?”

“We were discovered before nearing the back mountains,” the Left Envoy admitted. “I cannot fathom how.”

“No matter,” the Demon Lord waved dismissively. “Our purpose was mere disruption. Let them stew in anxiety. A graver matter demands your attention.”

“Your orders, my lord?”

“Last night, I reviewed Ancestor Menghua’s journals,” the Demon Lord revealed. “New insights emerged regarding the Eight-Sided Drum cultivation method you retrieved.”

“Then tell us!” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “What is this ‘Golden City’?”

“Cross-referencing records,” the Demon Lord explained, “I believe it refers to Miao City within the Great Desert. You three shall seek it out.”

Steward Sun and the fox demoness exchanged glances but remained silent. “Miao City?” The Left Envoy frowned. “In the desert’s heart?”

“That’s absurd!” Wang Xiaorong protested. “How could a city survive violent sandstorms? You must be mistaken!”

**Chapter 3587: Hard to Believe**

The Left Envoy shared her doubts but dared not voice them. Only Wang Xiaorong enjoyed such frankness with the Demon Lord.

“This is no ordinary settlement,” the Demon Lord insisted. “Miao City adapts to desert life through mystical means.”

“What connects it to the Golden City?”

“Ancestor Menghua’s millennium-old journals hint at contact with Miao City,” the Demon Lord explained. “Under moonlight, the desert’s golden sands would make the city appear as a metropolis of gold—a unique spectacle justifying its epithet.”

This reasoning swayed the listeners. “Brilliant deduction, my lord,” the Left Envoy conceded. “Yet after centuries, does Miao City even endure?”

“We must ascertain this before Cloud Azure Gate,” the Demon Lord declared. “The Eight-Sided Drum’s secrets cannot elude us again.”

“We’ll depart for the northwest desert immediately,” the Left Envoy vowed. “But without coordinates...”

“The journals mention one ill omen,” the Demon Lord interrupted. “Miao City’s location shifts unpredictably across the sands.”

“Shifts?” Wang Xiaorong gasped. “Does it fly?”

“In essence. Its position changes between visits despite marked routes.”

“Incredible!” The Left Envoy marveled, recalling Menghua’s subterranean palace—an engineering marvel. A mobile city surpassed even that wonder.

Wang Xiaorong’s eyes sparkled with anticipation. Such marvels demanded her presence!

“More astonishing still,” the Demon Lord continued, “Miao City houses not humans, but demons.”

Gasps filled the chamber. Only Steward Sun and the fox demoness remained unperturbed.

“An exclusive haven for demonkind,” the Demon Lord elaborated. “Humans find no welcome there.”

**Chapter 3588: No Match**

“How could such a place persist?” the Left Envoy wondered.

“Demons enjoy longevity,” the Demon Lord reasoned. “Steward Sun approaches three centuries, hale as ever. Millennia-old demons likely maintain the city.”

The Left Envoy grimaced. Desert survival alone posed challenges; locating a phantom city seemed impossible.

Wang Xiaorong’s thoughts mirrored Guanyu’s: a demon sanctuary offered respite from human persecution.

“We’ll need extensive preparations,” the Left Envoy advised. “Multiple search parties, ample supplies...”

“Agreed,” the Demon Lord nodded. “This demands sustained effort, not haste.”

“Father,” Wang Xiaorong interjected, “what of the ‘Divine Stone Mountain’ mentioned with the Golden City?”

“The journals show no record. I must study them further. The ‘flowering season’ clue likely indicates summer—our deadline to locate Miao City.”

“Cloud Azure Gate may already pursue this,” the Left Envoy warned. “At the sect, Guanyu recently bested Elder Xiang using the Imperial Seal’s stored magic, leaving him bloodied before the assembly.”

“How audacious!” The Demon Lord chuckled. “Striking his superior!”

“Elder Xiang provoked him!” Wang Xiaorong defended hotly. “Guanyu wouldn’t act without cause!”

The Demon Lord noted her fervor but refrained from comment. Guanyu’s dual cultivation prowess made him an ideal match—were he not Cloud Azure’s disciple.

“The Imperial Seal’s power...” The Left Envoy shuddered. “Its unleashed spell shattered hall windows while nearly killing a sect elder.”

“Guanyu absorbed the Eight-Sided Drum’s first chapter,” the Demon Lord mused. “Even without artifacts, he’d prove troublesome.”

“Wait,” he frowned. “Weren’t Guanyu’s artifacts confiscated?”

“A ruse,” the Left Envoy revealed. “Sect Master Xuanming conspired with him to deter challengers. Had we known earlier...”

“Those artifacts are rightfully his!” Wang Xiaorong snapped. “Attempt theft and you’ll share Blood Lord’s fate!”

“She speaks truth,” the Demon Lord conceded. “Left Envoy, against Guanyu’s Imperial Seal, you’d fare worse than Elder Xiang.”

**Chapter 3589: Grave Peril**

“Indeed,” the Left Envoy admitted. “I might match Elder Xiang in combat, but Guanyu’s strike nearly killed him instantly. I stand no chance.”

“Remember,” the Demon Lord cautioned, “Elder Xiang ranks lowest among Cloud Azure’s elders. Their true power lies elsewhere.”
