Young Master Feng, unable to evade the topic, redirected, “Then tell me, what should we do with those two good-for-nothings now? Do they still have any use?”

The “two good-for-nothings” referred to Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai. These men now only knew how to eat, drink, and leech off the Feng Family’s resources, utterly useless in every other regard.

“Those two are already spent,” Bill Lin stated. “When I returned today, I heard Guanyu even destroyed their headquarters. Keeping them is pointless. Find an opportunity to send them away—they’re worthless now.”

Young Master Feng had also heard about Guanyu’s raid. “Guanyu is ruthless. That very night, he sent men to burn Ge Yinglai’s headquarters—bars, bathhouses, all reduced to ashes. This is his style. We must be extra cautious when dealing with him.”

Knowing escape was impossible, Young Master Feng steeled himself. “Guanyu isn’t just cruel—he’s cunning. Last night’s provocation at his home crossed his bottom line. He’ll retaliate soon. After last night’s chaos, over half our forces are incapacitated. Without cannon fodder, our next move will be difficult.”

Bill Lin speculated, “I doubt Guanyu will act before the Yang Family’s auction. Last night’s battle cost both sides dearly. He’ll need time to regroup. After the auction, universities will reopen. Most of Yu Gang’s members are students—once classes start, his forces will dwindle. That’s our window to strike.”

Though Bill Lin’s reasoning seemed sound, Young Master Feng remained uneasy. To him, Guanyu was more terrifying than a ghost.

With no alternatives, Young Master Feng asked, “Where’s Luo Bo now? I heard he was severely injured. How bad is it?”

Bill Lin replied, “No news yet. He’s vanished without a trace.”

“Let me tell you—Luo Bo’s injury is entirely Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai’s fault. I’ve confirmed it: those idiots forced Luo Bo to assassinate Guanyu, leading to his重伤.”

“What?!” Bill Lin exclaimed. “Luo Bo, a First-Class Master, was beaten to near-death by Guanyu? Impossible! If Guanyu’s that powerful, he’d be invincible!”

Young Master Feng clarified, “Not Guanyu. A hidden expert intervened during the assassination attempt. They clashed, and Luo Bo was gravely wounded before disappearing. I wonder if he’s dead somewhere.”

“A First-Class Master doesn’t die so easily,” Bill Lin mused. If Guanyu had such a protector, targeting him would be exponentially harder. Anyone capable of defeating Luo Bo must possess terrifying cultivation.

“Also, Sun Xu claimed their opponents weren’t Yu Gang members initially. Over a hundred Yu Gang cultivators arrived later, including several experts. Our forces were ordinary people—it was a slaughter.”

Bill Lin frowned. “Then where were Yu Gang’s main forces?”

“Guanyu had already dispatched them to destroy Sun Xu’s leather factory and Ge Yinglai’s businesses. They torched everything.”

“But Fang Su hired cultivators for support. Didn’t they help?”

“They tried. But Guanyu’s experts blocked them. Our cultivators couldn’t break through.”

“Useless trash!” Bill Lin stood. “I’ll interrogate those two fools myself.”

Young Master Feng followed Bill Lin to the north building where Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu recuperated. Finding the pair awake but maimed—missing limbs—Bill Lin’s anger cooled slightly.

“Awake? How do you feel?” Bill Lin asked.

“Crippled. Better dead than like this,” Ge Yinglai spat through gritted teeth.

Sun Xu lay silent, staring blankly at the ceiling, ignoring the visitors.

Bill Lin focused on Ge Yinglai. “Explain last night. How did 500 men and hired cultivators lose so badly?”

Ge Yinglai winced. “We underestimated Guanyu. Initially, his small group of cultivators retreated under our assault. Then his experts arrived—one wielded a massive iron rod, sending men flying with each strike.”

Bill Lin turned to Young Master Feng. “The iron rod wielder—could it be those monks from Houyuan Temple?”

“Didn’t see it myself,” Young Master Feng shrugged. Ge Yinglai added, “They were bald monks. Deadly. Plus a woman beside Guanyu—our men froze in fear.”

“And then?”

“Chaos. When our hired cultivators arrived, fifty guards blocked them. Yu Gang’s main force later flanked us, intercepting our reinforcements.”

Bill Lin pressed, “Why send Luo Bo to assassinate Guanyu? His role was to protect you!”

“We panicked,” Ge Yinglai admitted. “Guanyu stood exposed on a distant car. When we heard our bases were burning, we ordered Luo Bo to kill him. But a hidden expert intercepted—Luo Bo was slashed, kicked, and vanished.”

“Fools!” Bill Lin snapped. “With Luo Bo, you could’ve escaped unharmed. Did you see him after capture?”

Ge Yinglai shook his head weakly. “He spat blood and disappeared. We thought he’d returned here.”

Unknown to them, Luo Bo was recuperating at the Bill residence. Bill Lin seethed—Guanyu’s hidden protector complicated everything.

**Chapter 2673: A Hefty Sum**

Meanwhile, rumors swirled: Feitian Lang (Sky Wolf), one of the Ten Great Villains, had stolen a treasure map fragment from Guanyu and planned to auction it at the Yang Family’s event.

Bill Lin saw opportunity. After multiple failed attempts to contact the elusive Feitian Lang, he offered 15 million for the map. Desperate to unload the “cursed” fragment, Feitian Lang agreed to meet at the Feng Estate.

The next morning, Bill Lin personally greeted Feitian Lang at the gates. In a secured parlor, they negotiated—Bill Lin revealing his own map fragment to establish trust.

Feitian Lang’s eyes gleamed with greed, though he resisted the urge to steal it outright. “A pleasure, Young Master Bill. Your reputation precedes you.”

“As does yours, Sky Wolf,” Bill Lin smiled. “Shall we discuss business?”

The stage was set—a dangerous alliance formed under the shadow of Guanyu’s growing power.
