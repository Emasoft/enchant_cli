After calling out and receiving no response from Ah Cai, Guan Yu immediately understood the situation. He walked over to Ah Cai and said, “Younger brother, let’s go eat. We’ll have the meal together.”

Ah Cai remained dazed for several seconds before processing Guan Yu’s words, murmuring blankly, “Oh… okay.”

After the meal, Guan Yu finalized all necessary arrangements. Tonight was the night to eradicate the human trafficking den. Ah Cai’s external injuries had mostly healed, and he would join Guan Yu tonight. With two more rounds of Jin Hua’s medicinal brews when she had time, his wounds would fully recover.

The stab wound Jin Hua had suffered from the Yang Family Patriarch was near her waist—a spot women particularly cherished, especially during summer when clothing revealed more. Later, Jin Hua brewed a secret formula to erase the scar, and now her waist showed no trace of the injury.

Initially, Guan Yu planned to leave Jin Hua at home, fearing the mission’s dangers. But upon reflection, he reconsidered. This rented house had only been occupied for two days and wasn’t as secure as Qiaoyuan District. Leaving Jin Hua behind might pose greater risks. It was safer to keep her close, where Guan Yu could protect her if danger arose.

As they prepared to depart, Jin Hua donned her black stealthy night attire—a outfit Guan Yu hadn’t seen her wear since their time at Yang Conghan’s villa. So much had changed since then.

Having Jin Hua nearby proved advantageous. She wouldn’t hinder Guan Yu, and her exceptional lightness skills ensured she could escape swiftly if needed. Moreover, her expertise in poisons would prove invaluable tonight.

Guan Yu had summoned two allies who arrived that morning: Ganbili and Second to Wolf, along with Ganbili’s subordinates. Originally, Guan Yu had asked Second to Wolf to monitor Qiaoyuan District, but the latter reported it was now an impenetrable fortress guarded round-the-clock by layers of patrols, police, and advanced surveillance. Even a top-tier expert like Second to Wolf couldn’t infiltrate it.

Guan Yu surmised this tight security was orchestrated by Hou Jinshun and the Yang Family. He had invited Second to Wolf for tonight’s mission knowing he’d agree—the man had lost his son years ago to traffickers, an event that shattered his marriage and drove him into the assassin organization Tian Tuan. Upon hearing Guan Yu’s plan, Second to Wolf eagerly joined, hoping against hope to find traces of his now twenty-year-old son.

Ganbili had been borrowed from Xu Jinglei’s side, bringing additional manpower. By 8 PM, Guan Yu drove to the western edge of Tea Street, an industrial zone on the city’s outskirts. The traffickers operated under the guise of a tea company—a common tactic where dens adopted local street or building names for camouflage.

“Tea company,” Guan Yu muttered as he drove slowly through the sprawling industrial area. The task was daunting, with massive factories spanning hundreds of acres. Ah Cai, who’d been transported blindfolded during his captivity, recognized nothing until a high-speed train thundered over a nearby bridge. “I often heard trains clearly at the den,” he realized.

Following the railway, Guan Yu navigated increasingly desolate roads until reaching a dead end. As they turned back, a speeding car darted into a side path. Suspicious, Guan Yu killed the lights and trailed it. The car stopped where walls enclosed three sides. Three figures emerged: an elderly woman, a burly man, and a blindfolded boy—whom Ah Cai recognized as a fellow trainee.

Before Guan Yu could react, a blade flashed in the headlights. Second to Wolf eliminated the two adults, leaving the bewildered boy. “You’ll alert them!” Guan Yu chided as Second to Wolf approached. The assassin shrugged, “The gate’s here.” He revealed a concealed entrance matching the walls’ yellow paint—a sliding stone door on hidden rails.

Finding the remote in the abandoned car, Second to Wolf proposed infiltrating disguised as the slain traffickers. Guan Yu and Jin Hua donned the dead pair’s clothes, their crude disguises (fake beard for him, aged makeup for her) barely passable. Against Jin Hua’s warnings, Guan Yu brought Ah Cai inside for guidance.

As they prepared to enter, the boy—who’d successfully stolen wallets that night—stood oblivious, his bindings and blindfold intact. Second to Wolf’s blade had granted him unintended freedom, but the real mission was just beginning.
