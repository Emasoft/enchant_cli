“No need, I’ll sit here for a while before returning,” Consort Guifen (Fragrant Osmanthus) replied. “My main purpose in coming is to inform you that I am truly prepared to move against the Second Prince this time. Whether we succeed will depend on the outcome. At the very least, I believe dealing with Prince Zou in the future would be easier than confronting the Second Prince, don’t you agree?”

The First Prince said softly, “These matters are for you to decide, Mother Consort. But please take care not to overexert yourself. Letting things follow their natural course might be wiser.”

Consort Guifen shook her head helplessly. Her son had always been indifferent to the struggle for the throne.

“I take such risks for our future,” she pressed. “If the Second Prince ascends the throne, we mother and son will not survive long. How can I not act urgently?”

“The Second Prince’s influence in the palace is at its zenith. Our strength pales in comparison. You must avoid direct conflict with him,” the First Prince advised. “Moreover, as a consort of the inner court, forming factions could draw Father Emperor’s suspicion. You must tread carefully.”

Though comforted by her son’s concern, Consort Guifen found his passivity unacceptable. “My child, do you truly not wish to fight for your future? If the Second Prince inherits the throne, he will never spare us.”

“What use is becoming emperor?” the First Prince replied flatly. “I have been dull-witted since childhood. Even if I ascended the throne, the civil and military officials would never respect me. A useless waste like me does not deserve the throne. It would only bring calamity to the people.”

“Have you no thought for our survival? The Second Prince and I have forged mortal enmity over these years. Once he takes power, he will have us executed on fabricated charges. Do you not see this?” Consort Guifen’s voice trembled with desperation. She could find no words to ignite ambition in her son.

Since childhood, the First Prince had been neglected by the Emperor. The more he was overlooked, the more indolent he grew. Failing to excel in studies, he abandoned them entirely, devoid of drive. Thus, the Emperor’s disdain deepened.

“I doubt it will come to that. Whoever becomes emperor would have no need to exterminate us. I believe they would leave us a path to survival,” the First Prince said calmly, his demeanor unchanged.

Consort Guifen sighed in resignation. “My struggle with the Second Prince grows fiercer by the day. The future is uncertain—we can only proceed step by step. Rest well, and send word if anything arises. I shall take my leave.” She rose and departed.

The First Prince escorted her to the gates. Only after her carriage vanished did he return to his chambers. Sitting in his chair, he said quietly, “You may come out now. What counsel do you offer?”

From the shadows emerged a man in his fifties—one who would startle Guan Yu and astound the Yunqing Sect. This was Chief Seat Xiang of Zuokong Peak.

“Consort Guifen speaks truth,” Chief Seat Xiang began. “To secure your footing in the capital, you cannot afford mercy. Others will perceive kindness as weakness. Strike decisively when the moment demands.”

**Chapter 4216: Proceeding According to Plan**

“You approve of Mother’s scheme to undermine the Second Prince’s faction covertly?” the First Prince asked. “But I disagree. Let Prince Zou drain the Second Prince’s strength. With experts at his side, Prince Zou will not fall easily.

“You heard the report: over a hundred Imperial Guards, including a centurion, were slain. Clearly, Prince Zou has formidable allies. Sending more men would only yield the same result.

“If the Second Prince discovers our interference, our fragile peace will shatter. We cannot yet oppose him openly.”

Chief Seat Xiang countered, “Your Highness, after years of planning, there is little to fear. Consider this: the Emperor will never pass the throne to Prince Zou, an external prince lacking legitimate claim. No ruler would surrender his realm to an outsider.

“The succession lies between you and the Second Prince. Prince Zou is the Second Prince’s problem. Our task is to weaken the Second Prince’s power through covert pressure. That is our wisest path.”

Though the logic was sound, the First Prince remained uneasy. “Your Highness,” Chief Seat Xiang urged, “the time has come to act. End your feigned passivity. Rise and claim your destiny.”

Their alliance had begun years prior. Recognizing hidden potential beneath the prince’s façade, Chief Seat Xiang had become his mentor, secretly nurturing his intellect and ambition. Under his guidance, the First Prince had grown shrewd, quietly laying the groundwork for his bid for power while maintaining his guise of mediocrity.

“I suspect Guan Yu is among Prince Zou’s retinue,” Chief Seat Xiang continued. “He is a troublesome adversary—brilliant and formidable. Though he opposes me within the Yunqing Sect, he would be an invaluable asset if persuaded to serve you.”

“You have mentioned him before. When Mother spoke of experts aiding Prince Zou, was she referring to him?”

“Guan Yu alone could not have slain a hundred Imperial Guards. I believe he orchestrated the Zhonghua Strategy, which caused their heavy losses.”

The First Prince paced thoughtfully. “What do you suggest, Master?”

**Chapter 4217: Cursing You Behind Your Back**

“We wager that the Emperor will not choose Prince Zou. Align with Prince Zou now. Ensure his safe arrival in the capital, then unite against the Second Prince. This is our optimal course.”

Years ago, Chief Seat Xiang had foreseen limited prospects in the Yunqing Sect. Meeting the First Prince, he discerned latent cunning beneath the prince’s mask of simplicity. Since then, under the guise of sect duties, he had secretly advised the prince, consolidating influence in the capital and sharpening his mind.

The First Prince regarded him as both mentor and strategist. Should the prince ascend the throne, Chief Seat Xiang’s dual status as sect elder and royal architect would secure his power across court and jianghu.

“Very well. I shall approach Prince Zou and seek alliance,” the First Prince declared.

Prince Zou’s convoy had reached Bajia City, a day behind schedule but unharmed.

Unfamiliar with the city’s governor, Prince Zou opted to lodge at the governor’s manor for security. His retinue of jianghu companions settled at a nearby inn, while only Zou Wuhui, Guan Yu, and a few others accompanied him.

Bajia’s governor, Magistrate Zhang, hosted a lavish evening banquet. After days of tension, Prince Zou finally relaxed, assured of a peaceful night’s rest.

Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong retired to their chamber, eager to wash away the grime of battle. “We take forever to dress each morning,” Wang Xiaorong grumbled as they prepared the next day.

“At least we aren’t Wang Jun,” Guan Yu chuckled. “Imagine maintaining a woman’s disguise.”

“He must curse you daily for that idea,” she laughed.

After breakfast, Magistrate Zhang excused himself on official business. Prince Zou, having lost weight from the arduous journey, resolved to rest another day before the final push to the capital.

Zou Wuhui visited the inn to address the wounded. “Those gravely injured will remain here at the prince’s expense,” he announced. “You’ll be retrieved once we reach the capital.”

The mercenaries approved, especially Redman, whose comrades included a man with a chest wound still oozing blood. “The prince honors his protectors,” Redman remarked. “This decision earns my respect.”
