Chapter 1748: Contempt

Twenty years ago, when Guan Yu first entered the Divine Realm, the world had fervently debated whether the greenhouse effect would melt all the ice at the North and South Poles, triggering catastrophic floods to submerge continents and potentially annihilate humanity. Yet now, he observed that the Arctic's expanse hadn't diminished—instead, it showed signs of expansion.

Whether scientists or self-proclaimed environmentalists, all had overestimated humanity's capacity to reshape this planet. Perhaps in certain eras, humans could indeed level mountains or bombard Earth into oblivion with nuclear arsenals. But across billions of years of history, humanity's mere tens of thousands of existence paled into insignificance. Dinosaurs once dominated for millions of years before vanishing entirely—how could our fleeting tenure compare?

Since entering the Divine Realm, Guan Yu often pondered Earth's fragility. Humans were so feeble that a single creature from a demonic realm could eradicate them all.

Spreading his spiritual sense, Guan Yu found no trace of the white bears. Uncertain of their hiding places, he decided to first inspect the human guardians stationed in the barracks.

Xue Jing, her water-attuned spiritual energy shielding her from the Arctic's subzero cold, gleefully tumbled in the snow like a silver-belled sprite. Her laughter soon drew guardians from nearby barracks—figures clad in fur coats and hats emerged, aiming an arsenal of firearms while shouting in English.

Though Xue Jing now possessed third-tier mutant strength, she remained a timid girl at heart. Startled by the weapons, she buried herself in Guan Yu's arms. His brow furrowed at their hostility.

Carrying Xue Jing, Guan Yu approached despite their demands for identification. When vulgar insults began, his patience thinned. These guardians, observing Guan Yu's apparent second-tier mutant level and youthful appearance, underestimated them both.

Minutes later, seated before the guardians with Xue Jing blushing behind him, Guan Yu endured their crude remarks about the girl. Half a year in this desolate ice prison had left these men starved for female company, their tongues loosened by assumed superiority.

Silent until now, Guan Yu finally erupted: "Sons of bitches! Finished your filth?"

The hardened mercenaries roared at this challenge, training their guns. Guan Yu noted their North American features—confirming He Wu's earlier intelligence that China hadn't sent personnel for mutation experiments here.

With Xue Jing in one arm, Guan Yu backhanded their leader. The third-tier mutant commander flew three meters, teeth and blood spraying. Chaos erupted as gunfire shredded icy mist...

When the haze cleared, five guardians found themselves airborne, crashing painfully onto ice. Guan Yu reappeared, untouched, using only his right hand.

Chapter 1749: Bear Onslaught

The leader gaped—their bullet storm had failed against this second-tier mutant cradling a girl. How?

These guardians, accustomed to groveling before successful mutants, now realized their fatal miscalculation. Guan Yu's disdainful gaze swept over them: "I'm from China—not Eastern Island."

Ushered into barracks with sudden deference, Guan Yu and Xue Jing received meager hospitality—rotten meat and decent wine. Xue Jing's summer attire in -50°C finally registered, sparking terrified realization among the guardians.

Conversation revealed rotating shifts monitoring the Divine Realm fifty miles ahead. Recent mutated bear attacks had killed over a dozen, forcing retreat. U.S. reinforcements were delayed.

Alarms suddenly blared as Xue Jing's cry pierced the air: "Husband! Huge bears!"

Five mountainous white bears advanced—each weighing nearly five tons, moving with uncanny coordination. Xue Jing clapped: "Let's adopt one as a pet! They'll scare thieves!"

Guardians cowered in ice cellars while Guan Yu indulged his beloved's whim. When the bears charged, his left hand yanked the central behemoth mid-pounce—eliciting horrified roars as tonnage defied physics.

Chapter 1750: Pet Polar Bear

To Xue Jing, Guan Yu felt protective since their moonlit first meeting. Though polar bears made improbable pets, he acquiesced: "Choose your favorite."

"All five are adorable! Let's take them all!" Her words stunned the hidden guardians—this "cute stupidity" redefined madness.

As the confused bears hesitated at this unprecedented defiance, Guan Yu's stance shifted. Xue Jing squealed with delight while ice trembled beneath titanic paws.

The lead bear found itself inexplicably airborne toward Guan Yu's outstretched hand—its panicked roars echoing across millennia-old glaciers as human and primal forces collided.
