The black fog created by Jin Hua surged violently outwards through the newly formed hole. Guan Yu immediately relished the fresh outside air, yet knew he couldn’t flee yet.

“Jin Hua, go first. Hide in the woods. I’ll follow shortly,” Guan Yu urged. Understanding his intent—that he could act faster without her—Jin Hua abandoned her plan to assist and darted toward the forest.

After watching her disappear, Guan Yu plunged back into the cavern to retrieve their tent and provisions. Without these, survival in the forest would prove arduous. Emerging again, he waited, biding time for the dark mist to disperse. Once it cleared, the Unicorn Water Buffalo would see they’d escaped and presumably drop its massive barrier.

Guan Yu planned to risk the creature’s water projectiles to reclaim their supplies later. Entering now risked the beast discovering the hole and trapping him permanently.

From a distant tree, Jin Hua watched anxiously as the fog thinned. The Unicorn Water Buffalo soon spotted Guan Yu. Unexpectedly, the beast’s horn began glowing brighter and brighter.

As the barrier gradually dissolved, Guan Yu sprinted at full speed, grabbing their belongings. Unnoticed by him, a new barrier—twice the size—began forming dozens of meters behind.

“Guan Yu, run!” Jin Hua screamed from afar. Only then did he glance up and realize the danger. Hurling his dagger at the beast to disrupt its spellcasting, he bolted toward Jin Hua. The distraction worked; the creature paused its shield formation to dodge, granting Guan Yu a fleeting escape.

Sweeping Jin Hua into his arms, he ran desperately, vowing inwardly never to encounter such a monstrous foe again. The distant roars of the enraged beast echoed behind them, but it didn’t pursue—perhaps deeming speed futile—and soon submerged into the lake, restoring calm.

**Chapter 3005: The Peculiar Tree**

After their narrow escape, Guan Yu and Jin Hua ran until exhaustion forced them to halt atop a massive tree. “Damn it, that thing was a super-monster. Absolutely deranged,” Guan Yu panted, drenched in sweat.

Jin Hua leaned against him, compliant as a doll. “True. We couldn’t fight or outrun it. Those rapid water attacks were vile—I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Luckily, we survived,” Guan Yu said, still shaken. “Now I understand why no other beasts lingered near that lake. Only fools like us would blunder in.”

Checking his compass, he found it smeared with mud. After wiping it clean, he confirmed they’d fled southward—deeper into the forest. His satellite定位仪, when retrieved, revealed a shattered screen. “Useless now,” he groaned.

Though directionless, they pressed on at dawn. “Two more days south,” Guan Yu decided. “If we find no trace of Uncle Qing, we’ll turn back. Time’s running out.”

Jin Hua’s heart sank at his despondency. Guan Yu, too, fought despair—had Qing Linger truly perished? Yet he clung to hope, determined to search until the final hour.

As they trekked cautiously through the beast-riddled heart of the forest, Jin Hua fixated on an odd tree ahead—a colossal trunk two meters thick, split vertically into black and off-white halves. Devoid of branches or leaves, it stretched unnaturally skyward, resembling a towering pillar.

Guan Yu’s unease spiked. The area felt eerily silent—no birds, scarce animals. He urged haste, recalling the Unicorn Water Buffalo’s lesson. Jin Hua complied, though curiosity lingered.

Guan Yu’s instincts screamed danger. Regions with few beasts often harbored greater threats. Here, even the trees felt wrong.

**Chapter 3006: Retreat**

As they hurried past more black-and-white “trees,” Guan Yu noticed one unusually close. Its bark resembled overlapping scales. Suddenly, the “tree” shifted.

Horror struck—it was no tree, but a gargantuan serpent rearing vertically, its head sunbathing atop the canopy. Every black-white trunk they’d passed was a camouflaged serpent!

Guan Yu grabbed Jin Hua and fled. These colossal snakes—some over two meters thick and dozens of meters long—could swallow an elephant whole. Their territory explained the absence of other creatures.

Only when distant did Guan Yu speak. “Those ‘trees’ were serpents.”

Jin Hua gaped. “But they stood so straight! How?”

“Their scales blended perfectly. I saw one move.”

She shuddered, imagining the scale. After encountering the Unicorn Water Buffalo, nothing seemed impossible.

Two days later, having found no human traces, they retreated to City A. Guan Yu returned discreetly, Jin Hua to her desolate mansion.

That night, Guan Yu called Qing Linger. “Any symptoms?” he asked urgently—her purported poisoning was days away.

“I’m fine. Where’ve you been?” she replied.

“Helping Jin Hua with something. Rest well.” Hanging up, he headed to Qiaoyuan District, reassured by Hou Jinshun’s report: the residence remained secure, though Yang family had retrieved Zhang Han.

Inside, the spotless house greeted him. He found Xue Jing, Lü Mei, and Amei gaming in Zhang Han’s room.

“Guan Yu!” they cried, abandoning their screens.

“Missed me?” he teased, then mock-scolded Amei: “How late have you stayed up gaming?”

**Chapter 3007: Self-Preservation**

The girls froze, guilty. Xue Jing deflected with a smile: “We kept everything tidy!”

Guan Yu sighed, warmth overriding reproach. Their safety mattered most—and for now, all was well.
