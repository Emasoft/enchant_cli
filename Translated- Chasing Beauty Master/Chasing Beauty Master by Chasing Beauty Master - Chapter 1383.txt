“Although our Yunqing Sect does not ardently covet the Eight-Drum Art,” Elder Jiu continued, “for our sect’s techniques are already the most formidable in the martial world, if we do not seize it, the Demon Sect surely will. Should that accursed faction obtain it, their strength would swell, emboldening them to commit even more heinous atrocities. And we righteous sects would find it increasingly difficult to oppose them.”

Guan Yu chuckled inwardly. *Who would have thought Elder Jiu could talk such big game?* If Yunqing’s techniques were truly peerless, why fear the Demon Sect acquiring the Eight-Drum Art? Even if they did, wouldn’t Yunqing’s “unrivaled” methods still prevail?

The truth was far simpler: whoever mastered the Eight-Drum Art would dominate the martial world, rendering all rivals obsolete. Its reputation alone spoke volumes.

In Guan Yu’s view, Yunqing’s urgency stemmed from dread. Should the Demon Sect obtain the art, Yunqing would lose its edge, and the righteous sects would be driven into hiding—scattered, hunted, their glory shattered.

**Chapter 3584: A Stroke of Luck**

The Yunqing Sect was not alone in its desperation. Every faction privy to the Eight-Drum Art’s resurgence hungered for it. Smaller sects lacked the strength to contend openly, while powerhouses like the Crimson Lotus Sect and Zhenyang Sect bided their time, awaiting clearer leads.

The Crimson Lotus disciples likely still roamed Qujiang City, oblivious to the collapse of Ancestor Menghua’s underground palace. As for Zhenyang Sect, their absence puzzled Guan Yu. His own entry into Duobao Mountain had been sheer luck—thanks to Xiao Zhi’s familial ties in Qujiang and the hidden entrance within the Qin Manor. Had the Demon Sect found it first, the Eight-Drum Art might already be in the Demon Lord’s hands. Fate, it seemed, had intervened.

While Elder Jiu boasted of Yunqing’s supremacy—a claim none openly contested, especially with Xuanming wielding the Hidden Dragon Sword—the Eight-Drum Art’s legendary potency remained an unknown. Guan Yu had absorbed its first portion yet felt no earth-shattering transformation.

“Elder Jiu,” Guan Yu ventured, “why not discreetly monitor the Demon Sect’s movements? With spies embedded among them, we could let them lead us to Miao City. Would that not be wiser?”

“A sound strategy in theory,” Elder Jiu conceded, “but the Demon Sect is cunning. They might mislead us, exposing our agents. A classic case of ‘losing the rice while stealing the chicken.’”

“The Demon Sect likely anticipates this,” Guan Yu countered. “They’re waiting for *us* to exhaust ourselves locating Miao City, then swoop in to claim the prize without effort.”

“Regardless,” Elder Jiu insisted, “we *must* secure the Eight-Drum Art before them. Even if it demands Herculean effort, we proceed. Should they fail to track us, victory is ours.” He nodded, pleased with his reasoning. “This operation stays covert. I’ll inform Xuanming to dispatch a covert team. Secrecy is paramount—we cannot alert the Demon Sect’s spies.”

*Futile,* Guan Yu mused. Yunqing teemed with Demon Sect informants. True secrecy would require him alone to search for Miao City—trusting no one else. Why the rush? The Eight-Drum Art required the “blooming season,” still three months away. Let Lin Chen and Ling Su clamor for glory; their eagerness to impress Xuanming might spare him the trouble.

“Elder Jiu is right,” Guan Yu agreed blandly. “Securing Miao City first is crucial.” Privately, he couldn’t care less. Let others chase shadows while he enjoyed peace.

“Yet pinpointing the ‘blooming season’ is precarious,” Elder Jiu sighed. “Though summer lies three months ahead, locating Miao City itself could take years in the desert—if it even still exists.”

“Like finding a needle in a sea of sand,” Guan Yu remarked.

“True,” Elder Jiu said, resolve hardening, “but we *cannot* relent. This isn’t for our sake, but for the world’s safety. Should the Demon Sect claim the Eight-Drum Art, catastrophe follows.”

Guan Yu conceded the point. In righteous hands, the art might be controlled. In the Demon Lord’s? A tool for carnage. That ambitious tyrant, thirsting to crush Yunqing and dominate the martial world, would spare none who defied him.

“Elder Jiu’s selflessness is admirable,” Guan Yu said, suppressing a shudder at his own flattery. “To prioritize the realm’s welfare despite transcending worldly concerns…”

“Heh! Since when did you, little vase, learn to sweet-talk?” Elder Jiu sneered. The insult prickled—a “vase” was mere decoration, useless. Guan Yu bristled inwardly but maintained his grin.

“I speak only truth, Elder. Your wisdom guides us.”

Elder Jiu’s expression darkened. “There’s something you don’t know. The Demon Lord’s ambitions run deeper. His desire for the Eight-Drum Art ties to a greater scheme.”

**Chapter 3585: A Grave Conspiracy**

“A greater scheme?” Guan Yu leaned forward. The Demon Lord’s hunger for power was well-known, but Elder Jiu’s tone hinted at apocalypse.

“The Eight-Drum Art is linked to a primordial horror.” Elder Jiu lowered his voice. “Years ago, the Demon Lord nurtured a fiend—Tian Yuan, a gargantuan ape-like beast over three meters tall, endowed with monstrous strength and sorcery. It’s said Tian Yuan was a prince of the demonic realm, wounded during their invasion a millennium ago. Though humans sought to kill it, Ancestor Menghua intervened, subduing it through unknown means.

“Tian Yuan’s fang forged Menghua’s Eight-Drum artifact. Later, the beast fell into the Demon Lord’s hands. Under his care, it grew stronger—too strong. Even the Demon Lord feared its uncontrollable wrath. Eventually, it vanished.

“Legends say gathering all four volumes of the Eight-Drum Art can resurrect Tian Yuan. Should it return, humanity faces extinction. With no path to dominance, the Demon Lord seeks chaos—using Tian Yuan to shatter the righteous sects’ hegemony, even if it dooms his own followers.”

Guan Yu’s blood chilled. He’d encountered demonic creatures before, but none rivaling this. Wang Xiaorong once mentioned a childhood brush with a Demon Lord-kept beast—likely Tian Yuan.

“But if Tian Yuan answers to none,” Guan Yu pressed, “why risk reviving it? Wouldn’t the Demon Lord be its first target?”

“Desperation,” Elder Jiu replied. “He’d rather mutual destruction than eternal subjugation. A resurrected Tian Yuan would dwarf even a peak Boundary Sovereign and dual Celestial Immortals—unstoppable.”

Guan Yu grasped the urgency. “So all four volumes are needed?”

“Yes. Menghua fragmented the art to prevent misuse. Fortunately.”

*Not entirely,* Guan Yu thought. He’d already absorbed the first volume. Unless the Demon Lord killed him, four volumes were impossible. And with Wang Xiaorong’s loyalty…

“We must act,” Guan Yu declared, feigning concern.

“Precisely.” Elder Jiu’s gaze sharpened. “And you, Guan Yu, are pivotal. Trustworthy disciples are scarce. Only you can lead this.”

*Flattery.* Guan Yu saw through the manipulation. Yunqing’s indoctrination might sway others, but not him.

“Elder Jiu,” he sighed, “yesterday in Tiger’s Peak Hall, Lin Chen and Ling Su accused me of incompetence and glory-seeking. If they crave merit, let them hunt Miao City. The desert is perilous—perhaps hardship will temper their tongues.”

**Chapter 3586: Endless Troubles**

Elder Jiu nodded. “Jealousy drives them. Before your arrival, they basked in Xuanming’s favor. Now overshadowed, they resent you. Let them taste reality.”

Guan Yu feigned relief. “They’ll return humbled—or not at all.”

As their discussion wound down, Guan Yu offered to keep Elder Jiu company during his meditation—a proposition met with dry amusement.

Meanwhile, Wang Xiaorong returned to the Demon Sect, her spirits high despite a recent failed infiltration of Yunqing’s rear mountains with the Azure Dragon Left Emissary.

“Where is the Left Emissary?” the Demon Lord inquired, noting her buoyancy. “You seem… pleased. Did your mission succeed?”
