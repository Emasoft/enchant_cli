“Old Wu explained, ‘Young Master Bill, why do you feel it’s not worth it? Treasure maps, due to their rarity and immense value, continuously appreciate. You’ve already acquired two pieces, which haven’t lost value. If you auctioned them at the Yang family’s event now, they’d surely fetch higher prices than before, wouldn’t they?’

Bill Lin pondered. Old Wu’s reasoning made sense. The two maps he owned weren’t losses. If auctioned now, each could easily sell for fifty million. With that in mind, sixty million for this third map didn’t seem excessive.

Zhang De feigned deep contemplation. ‘Let me contact Patriarch Yang again for his decision. I’ll visit the restroom first.’

Old Wu urged, ‘Please don’t keep us waiting long.’ Secretly thrilled, he marveled at the bid soaring to sixty million. Though most profits would go to others, his cut remained substantial.

He now admired the strategist behind the scenes. Earlier, bids had crawled to nine million, yet within moments, they’d skyrocketed by half-million increments. No wonder the mastermind demanded ninety percent—such boldness required skill and confidence.

Sixty million satisfied Old Wu. Even after deducting the agreed fifteen million, his share was life-changing. This deal, his largest and most successful, would transform his pawnshop. He envisioned expanding it into the city’s premier destination for collectors.

Wealthy elites frequented pawnshops for rare gifts to curry favor. A grander establishment would attract more high-profile clients. Perception dictated value—a water bottle cost one yuan in a store but five in a luxury hotel. Atmosphere mattered.

Exiting, Zhang De pretended to call while awaiting Guan Yu’s instructions. At sixty million, pushing further risked Bill Lin withdrawing. Guan Yu hesitated, weighing the gamble.

During Zhang De’s absence, Bill Lin gloated. Yang’s hesitation suggested their limit. Swaggering, he declared, ‘Old Wu, prepare the map. The Yangs can’t match this bid. It’s mine.’

Old Wu humored him. ‘Indeed, Young Master. But let’s await Yang’s final response. I doubt they’ll counter.’

Bill Lin sipped air to soothe his burnt tongue. ‘Your tea’s flavorful—pity I scalded myself.’

‘I’ll gift you some later, along with royal jelly,’ Old Wu offered.

‘Tea mastery hinges on skill and tools,’ Bill Lin pontificated. ‘Like cooking—the same ingredients yield different dishes.’

Surprised by Bill Lin’s discernment, Old Wu praised, ‘Young Master’s wisdom astounds! I brew my own tea—my apprentice ruins leaves.’

‘True expertise requires the right hands,’ Bill Lin conceded. ‘We must discuss this again.’

‘You’re always welcome,’ Old Wu smiled.

As Zhang De returned, Bill Lin sneered, ‘Must Yangs dawdle? Sixty million’s the price—take it or leave it!’

‘Patriarch Yang wishes to bid higher,’ Zhang De announced.

‘What?!’ Bill Lin shot up. ‘Sixty-five million?! Fine—I withdraw! Let’s see you profit then!’

Old Wu panicked, knowing Zhang De’s bluff.

‘We raise… one million,’ Zhang De stated flatly.

‘A million?!’ Bill Lin scoffed. ‘Pathetic!’

Guan Yu’s calculated move aimed to pressure without overreaching. Bill Lin’s limit was sixty-five million—exceeding it risked collapse.

‘Name Yang’s ceiling!’ Bill Lin demanded.

‘Sixty-five million,’ Zhang De revealed.

‘Coincidence? That’s my limit too!’ Bill Lin laughed bitterly.

Old Wu feigned amazement. ‘Remarkable! Your appraisals align!’

‘Your counter?’ Zhang De pressed.

‘Sixty-six million—my final offer,’ Bill Lin spat. ‘Yang can’t match this.’

Zhang De nodded. ‘We withdraw.’

Old Wu’s heart soared—sixty-six million! His twenty percent meant two thousand million, while the mastermind took forty-five. Envy flickered; the schemer earned double for mere words.

‘Bill Lin’s wealth prevails,’ Zhang De conceded, departing with flattery. ‘The Yangs salute your largesse.’

‘Don’t linger,’ Bill Lin coldly dismissed.

Post-sale, Old Wu presented the map in a glass case. ‘Shall we formalize the contract?’

‘You’ve profited handsomely,’ Bill Lin grumbled.

‘Merely following agreements,’ Old Wu demurred, sliding over paperwork.

Reluctantly, Bill Lin signed. ‘The funds will transfer later.’ He departed, map secured.

Outside, Poison Widow and Luo Bo awaited. ‘Draw a check,’ Bill Lin ordered, accepting Old Wu’s tea gift spitefully.

Nearby, Second Only to Wolf monitored from a hotel. Once Bill Lin’s convoy left, he joined Zhang De at the pawnshop.

Old Wu paled under Second’s intimidating aura.

‘Your cut’s fifteen million,’ Second stated. ‘The remaining fifty-one million splits ninety-ten. You keep five hundred ten thousand. We take forty-five million nine hundred thousand.’

Old Wu hesitated. ‘Perhaps round it to forty-five million? My efforts merit—’

‘Calculations stand,’ Second interrupted. ‘Every cent counts.’

The room tensed, Old Wu’s greed meeting unyielding resolve."
