Once again directing the accusations at Zhao Jing'er (Quiet Child), Guan Yu finally lost his patience.

“What exactly are you trying to say?” Guan Yu leaned protectively beside Zhao Jing'er, his cold gaze fixed on Feng Xin. From Jing'er's trembling shoulders and fearful eyes, he sensed her embarrassment and terror.

“I’ll say this one last time—it’s not what you think! If you refuse to believe me, tell me: What do you want to hear? What outcome are you hoping for? Do you want me to say I like her, that I deliberately took advantage of her? Fine! I like her! I adore Jing'er’s body, I love touching her—satisfied? If that’s not enough, I’ll add that I’ve fallen for her. Happy now?” Guan Yu retorted angrily, his words tumbling out in a heated rush.

Feng Xin frowned, studying Guan Yu’s resentful demeanor. Something felt off.

“You… Guan Yu, you…” Feng Xin gradually regained her composure, sensing an unusual tension. After a quick analysis, she realized Guan Yu didn’t seem like the type to lose control over lust. In fact, he appeared deeply principled.

Had she truly misunderstood him?

“Guan Yu, you’re lying, right? How could you like her? You’re just trying to upset me, aren’t you?” Du Xiaojuan stammered, tears streaming down her face as she clutched at his sleeve.

“Alright, alright… stop crying.” Guan Yu sighed, overwhelmed by the drama. Though initially furious, the sight of Xiaojuan’s fragile helplessness softened his heart.

As the tension eased, Zhao Jing'er timidly spoke up: “Xin-jie, Brother really was treating my illness.”

Feng Xin opened her mouth to question further, but Guan Yu cut her off with a wave. “Fine—see for yourselves!” He turned, pressing his palm against Jing'er’s bra-clad chest, calmly activating his healing technique.

The white bra instantly scorched and crumbled to ash, revealing her bare breast beneath his hand.

Jing'er whimpered in embarrassment, squeezing her eyes shut as her long lashes fluttered nervously. This was entirely different from past treatments in the capital, where Guan Yu had always touched her through blankets. Now, her unrestrained flesh spilled into his palm, the peaked bud exposed to the air.

Stimulated by the electric current, it stiffened instantly. Jing'er wished she could vanish into the floor.

Meanwhile, Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan gaped in shock.

“How… how is this possible?” Feng Xin whispered. A hand burning through fabric defied all logic. Was there fire in his palm?

Ignoring their stunned silence, Guan Yu focused on channeling healing energy into Jing'er’s body.

“Done.” He exhaled, withdrawing his hand and striding toward the door.

“Jing'er, change your clothes. I’ll make dinner.” He brushed past the two women without a glance.

After a stunned pause, Feng Xin awkwardly apologized: “Jing'er-mei, I’m sorry for misunderstanding.”

“I’m so sorry, really!” Du Xiaojuan echoed tearfully.

Jing'er waved her hands frantically. “It’s fine, really!” Though hurt by the accusations, their earnest apologies flustered her.

Feng Xin fetched Jing'er’s newly bought undergarments while Du Xiaojuan helped her dress. “Jing'er-mei, your skin’s so cool and smooth,” Xiaojuan teased. “And these are so full and bouncy! I wonder what Guan Yu thinks when he touches them.”

“That jerk got lucky, seeing and fondling our sweet Jing'er,” Feng Xin added with a smirk.

Jing'er’s face burned. “Please, stop! This is mortifying!”

Once dressed, Feng Xin announced: “Xiaojuan, stay with Jing'er. I’ll check on our grumpy chef.”

Downstairs, Guan Yu rummaged through the kitchen.

“Cooking personally? How modern of you,” Feng Xin leaned in the doorway, her tone teasing yet edged with jealousy.

Guan Yu set down his knife. “Xin-jie, Jing'er needs specially prepared meals. If you’re jealous, I’ll cook for you daily too.”

Feng Xin’s guilt surged. She tugged his arm. “I… I spoke harshly earlier. I was just… worried about you.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow—rare admission from her.

“But don’t get any ideas about Jing'er!” she warned, poking his forehead. “If you must touch someone…”

Chapter 286: Confessions

Reading his thoughts, Feng Xin pinched his arm, blushing. “What are you imagining?”

“Nothing!” He grinned innocently.

“You’ve got Xiaojuan! No philandering!” she threatened.

Guan Yu studied her silently until she squirmed. As she tried to flee, he pulled her into his arms—their first embrace.

“Xin-jie, are you jealous?” he murmured, lips near her forehead.

“Of a kid like you? Don’t flatter yourself,” she muttered, flushing.

He nuzzled her brow. “No more unwarranted jealousy, understand?”

When she hesitated, he tightened his grip, their bodies pressing together. Feng Xin’s legs trembled against his, her face scarlet.

“Understood,” she whispered, heart racing. Was this a confession? But what about Xiaojuan?

“I’ll cherish you,” he vowed, kissing her forehead and swatting her rear. “Now check on the girls upstairs.”

Dazed, Feng Xin leaned against the stairwell wall, gasping. “He… kissed me? But he’s younger… and taken! Why does this feel so right?”

Resolving to enjoy their secret closeness, she smiled privately.

In the kitchen, Du Xiaojuan approached guiltily. “I’m sorry I doubted you.”

Guan Yu wiped her tears. “I understand your fear. But trust me, alright?”

“I love you so much,” she blurted. “Even if you tire of me someday, just let me stay by you now.”

Moved, Guan Yu embraced her. “I adore you, Xiaojuan. Your tears shatter me.”

Later, as Jing'er devoured her peculiar meal of fish bones and chicken skin, Feng Xin and Xiaojuan fled to dine out.

Over dinner, Guan Yu asked Jing'er: “Did you confirm your school enrollment?”

“Grandfather handles such trifles,” she shrugged.

“Trifles?” Guan Yu chuckled at her nonchalance about privilege.

“Brother, let’s buy a laptop later. Want to invest 2 million with me?” Jing'er suddenly proposed.

“Invest?” Guan Yu blinked.

“To earn money!” she declared brightly.

Chapter 287: Stock Market Risks

As Guan Yu comforted the tearful Xiaojuan in the kitchen, he reflected on women’s tears being men’s kryptonite. Later, watching Jing'er relish her bizarre meal, both women lost their appetites.

“Let’s eat out,” Feng Xin suggested, dragging Xiaojuan away.

At the restaurant, Jing'er requested a laptop. “Brother, dare to invest?”

“Two million?” Guan Yu eyed her skeptically.

She grinned. “Let’s make fortune together!”
