“What ‘me’? Shut your mouth first and let me finish speaking, will you?” Guan Yu said, disregarding Kyle’s livid expression as he continued, “I merely wish to know—aside from being a clan member, are there other requirements to become the Elven clan leader?”

“Of course,” interjected an elder resembling Kyle’s age. “A qualified leader must excel in both civil and martial virtues, commanding profound respect. Even youthful candidates must demonstrate upright character and advanced cultivation.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Understood. Then I ask—aside from Patriarch Allen present here, who among you believes they meet these criteria?”

The chamber fell silent. All exchanged uneasy glances, uncertain how to respond.

After three seconds of stillness, Elder Kyle sprang to his feet. “Electing a clan leader is our sacred Elven affair! How dare an outsider whelp meddle in this?”

“Hoho,” Guan Yu chuckled. “Why must you alone rage like a storm amidst this calm sea? We’re merely discussing possibilities, not enacting succession. Patriarch Allen remains our sole legitimate leader. Let any aspirant first weigh whether they meet the standards before coveting his seat!”

“But under Allen’s leadership, the Source of Life withered!” countered a speaker Guan Yu recognized as Elder Bill—Kyle’s brother. “This crisis threatens our entire clan’s future! If such failure goes unchallenged, what purpose does a leader serve?”

Observing the fraternal elders, Guan Yu smiled knowingly. Their familial ties with Locke explained their coordinated ambition.

“Your point holds merit, Elder,” Guan Yu conceded. “Yet allow me to add—surely you understand the Source’s decline better than I?”

“Wh-what do you imply?” Bill paled, sweat beading his brow.

Guan Yu laughed heartily at his reaction. “Merely a jest! Yet your panic could make onlookers suspect guilt!”

Bill’s murderous glare spoke volumes, though he wisely held his tongue.

“Enough quarreling!” Amy interjected with a placating gesture. “Resume discussions tomorrow.”

As the dissenters retreated, Allen declared, “Let’s formalize this. Since all concern centers on the Source and leadership, I’ll bind both matters. Grant me three days. If the Tree of Life shows no improvement, I’ll resign. Agreed?”

Locke and Kyle’s eyes gleamed—had Allen obtained the Crystal Toad? Locke scrutinized Guan Yu, finding no telltale bulge. Yet they acquiesced, masking their suspicion.

Secretly, Locke remained confident. The Tree suffered not ordinary ailment, but a Gu poison curse learned from western beastkin—a formation immune to Crystal Toad’s magic. His path to power seemed clear. With four elders’ support, overwhelming Allen’s faction would prove simple. As for Guan Yu? A feeble ant beneath notice.

After the council dispersed, Allen barred the doors. Surveying Guan Yu’s disheveled state, he sighed, “Brother Guan, I worried all night after hearing of your mishap. Seeing you hale gladdens my heart!”

“Gladdened by the Crystal Toad’s fate, surely,” Guan Yu teased.

Allen’s awkward smile faltered. “Both, both! Now—show me this legendary relic!”

Guan Yu tapped his stomach. “You’ll find it... here.”

“Wh-what?!” Allen gaped.

“Consumed and digested. I know explanations sound hollow, but I swear—it was accidental!”

Allen groaned. “Had I known earlier before making that vow! Why didn’t you warn me?!”

“You never asked! Besides, who’d predict your self-sabotage?”

Amy pouted nearby. “You’re both horrid! I don’t understand a word—this isn’t fun!”

“Fun?!” Allen exclaimed. “Child, I’m losing my position!”

“Good!” Amy retorted. “Then you’ll finally have time for me!”

Chapter 1287: Venomous Insects

Resigned to the Crystal Toad’s loss, Allen slumped despondently.

“Patriarch,” Guan Yu ventured, “Might I speak plainly?”

“No more riddles! Speak!”

Observing Allen’s rare agitation, Guan Yu grew solemn. “Even intact, the Toad couldn’t cure the Tree. Its blight stems not from natural decay, but deliberate sabotage—specifically, Gu poison.”

Allen jolted upright. “Evidence?”

“From Life Island guards’ testimony. The perpetrator?” Guan Yu paused. “Locke himself.”

“I knew it!” Amy crowed. “That nasty Locke!”

Though shaken, Allen demanded proof.

Guan Yu closed his eyes, summoning elemental energies. Rainbow hues swirled about him—a display leaving Allen awestruck at the youth’s burgeoning prowess.

“Enough marvels!” Allen pressed. “Explain the Gu poison!”

“The Tree suffers not ordinary affliction. Gu venoms vary—insect, beast, floral. We must identify the specific curse.”

“Insects eat trees!” Amy interjected. “So insect Gu!”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. “Plausible! But confirmation requires investigation.”

Allen paled. “Even if known, can we counter it?”

“Perhaps through beastkin aid. The nearest beastman territory lies 3,000 li hence...”

“Three days’ hard ride—barely enough for a one-way trip,” Guan Yu calculated.

“Useless!” Allen groaned. “Any alternatives?”

“Visit Yongzhou’s Golden Auction House. Seek someone named Shituo. Mention resolving the Elven Gu curse—but don’t cite me. Agree to any terms; I’ll handle consequences.”

Chapter 1288: Shituo

As Guan Yu departed, Amy trailed after him. “I’m coming! I know Shituo!”

“Father permits this?”

“He said accompanying you beats moping here!”

Their exit was interrupted by Shao Siming and Luo Xi’s approach. The once-formal pair now chatted amiably—an odd sight in hierarchical Elven society.

“We... didn’t expect you back,” Guan Yu stammered.

Luo Xi smirked. “How gracious of the busy hero to remember us!”

As Amy stifled giggles, Guan Yu sighed. The road ahead promised more turbulence than any Gu poison.
