“A-Yu, you were quite vigorous last night~ Wen Qing absolutely loved it.” Seeing Guan Yu’s astonished expression resembling a violated bride, Wen Qing couldn’t resist teasing him deliberately.

“I…” Her words proved effective. Guan Yu’s face flushed crimson in an instant.

“It’s still early.” Wen Qing murmured as she slowly crawled toward him, her deep cleavage and seductive gaze magnetizing any man’s attention.

Guan Yu felt his throat burning dry, his mind blank. Though his body instinctively recoiled as she approached, his eyes remained fixed on her.

“Want another round?” Wen Qing pressed against him, asking coquettishly.

“N-no… no more.” Guan Yu heard his own trembling voice.

“Sure? Then I’ll be off, young man.” With a light laugh, she strode away.

“Damn it! To be teased by a woman until I’m speechless, and even forgot to check her motives!” Guan Yu cursed after she left, refusing to believe her intentions were pure.

Suddenly remembering his meager cash and $2 Nokia phone, he leaped off the bed naked. Rummaging through his faded jeans, he confirmed his wallet and phone were untouched.

Relieved, he sighed. He hadn’t feared theft—replacements were cheap—but the humiliation of being scammed for both money and body horrified him.

If not for wealth or lust, why approach him?

As confusion struck, he noticed a stack of pink bills on the nightstand. Rubbing his eyes in disbelief, he stared for seconds before exclaiming: “Did I… get paid for sex?!”

“Fuck!” He threw his pants down, lunged for the money, and verified each bill’s authenticity.

“Damn! I really was paid!” Guan Yu gaped at the twelve pink notes, torn between laughter and tears.

Eyeing his phone and wallet, he shook his head bitterly. “Might as well have lost them.”

The Nokia’s buzzing reminded him of last night’s frenzy. Was that really me…?

Shaking his head violently, he answered the call.

“Guan Yu! How dare you return without coming home or calling? Don’t you know how much I missed you, you bastard, you rotten egg!” Du Xu’s tirade dissolved into sobs.

“Senior, don’t cry!” Guan Yu panicked at her tears.

“Idiot! Jerk!”

“Yes, yes, I’m a jerk. Please stop crying.” He imagined her curled on the sofa, tissue box in hand, weeping into the phone.

“When… when are you coming back?” She sniffled childishly after minutes.

“Immediately! I’m leaving now!”

“Half an hour.”

“Done! I’ll be there!” He agreed urgently, fearing renewed tears.

Hanging up, he dressed hastily without washing. In this sprawling city, reaching home in thirty minutes seemed impossible if this was the outskirts. As he turned to leave, a glance at his finger stopped him cold—

Pulling back the sheets, he stared at the blossoming scarlet stain on white linen, the crimson traces under his nail…

Holy hell. Was she… a virgin?

His jaw slackened. Modern girls were terrifying—surrendering their first time so casually? Or maybe… menstruation?

Whatever. A forgotten, sensationless encounter—best treated as a dream.

Rushing downstairs, he hailed a taxi after five minutes. “Master, hurry! Emergency!” he barked upon giving the address.

“Young man, life’s long. What’s the rush?” The driver maintained leisurely pace.

Guan Yu nearly cursed. “Please speed up!” He slapped his “earnings” onto the passenger seat.

Eyes glazing at the pink stack, the driver swallowed lustfully and stomped the accelerator. “Hold tight!”

Fueled by greed, the twenty-minute sprint covered a normally forty-minute route. Guan Yu dashed into the alleyway, panting as Du Xu checked her watch.

“Exactly thirty minutes.” She smiled approvingly.

“You…” He wheezed, infuriated by her grin.

“You left me here!” She preempted his anger.

“My fault.” He embraced the pouting girl.

“Damn right!” She blushed, playfully pounding his chest.

“Yes, all my fault.” He endured her kittenish blows, inhaling her milky fragrance.

“What’s that smell?”

Sniffing like a puppy, she made his heart race—unwashed from last night! Would she discover…?

Suddenly, she shoved him away. “When did you last shower? You reek!”

“Just… one night…” Relief flooded him as he flushed.

“Go wash! Now!” she roared.

Sneaking a peek at her thoughts confirmed her ignorance, calming his nerves.

“Need to return to the hotel first.” He smiled wryly.

“Yu-ge! How was last night?” At the hotel, Niu Le smirked suggestively from the couch.

“Fan-tastic.” Guan Yu gritted through memories of being paid.

“Guan Yu! Didn’t you visit your cousin? Something wrong?” Du Xu inquired.

“No, she treated me well.” He shot Niu Le a grateful look, met with a thumbs-up.

“Go shower! Stinky!” Oblivious to their exchange, Du Xu pushed him jealously.

Twenty minutes later, a clean Guan Yu faced Du Xu’s awestruck gaze.

“Wh-what?” He stammered under her sparkling eyes.

“Guan Yu! You’re amazing!” She leapt into his arms. “Niu Le said you bought a huge red ice jadeite in Myanmar? True?!”

“Ah… yes. Why?”

“We’re rich!” She shrieked, jumping while clinging to his neck, oblivious to his crimson face.

Her breasts rhythmically crushed against him, blood surging to his head. Had they grown? Should I inspect them tonight?

“Ahem! Remember the single man here?” Niu Le coughed pointedly.

Still dangling from Guan Yu, Du Xu kissed him loudly and stuck her tongue out. “We’ll torment you!”

Niu Le mock-growled on the couch. When did these two get so close?

Chapter 219: A First Time?

As the saying goes, money makes ghosts turn millstones. While debatable, wealth undeniably smooths paths.

“Let’s buy a house! No more hotels!” Du Xu’s morning demand yanked Guan Yu from bed. Gathering local friends Tian Hao and Luo Cheng, they scouted properties through an agency.

Niu Le eagerly agreed, hating dawn disturbances by cleaning staff.

Within half an hour, they found a three-story villa—fully furnished, newly renovated, with private yard.

Du Xu’s eyes sparkled at the listing. The agent explained: “Bought for wedding, but bride eloped. Owner can’t bear the emptiness.”

“What idiot bride would flee this?” Tian Hao muttered. “I’d never leave.”

His father would need lifetimes to afford such a place.

“Ha! Want me to find you such a husband?” Du Xu’s jab reddened Tian Hao’s cheeks, though laughter soon eased the moment.

At the villa, the pungent smell of new paint assaulted them. Du Xu dashed inside, marveling at everything.

“Three million,” the agent stated.

“Three million?!” Tian Hao gaped at Guan Yu, who simply asked: “Bank transfer acceptable?”

Post-paperwork frustrations (“Damn bureaucratic slowness!”), they decided to move next day.

That evening, gorging at a restaurant, Tian Hao asked: “Yu-ge, what work made you rich?”

“Just luck,” Guan Yu smiled.

As Niu Le recounted their adventures, Tian Hao regretted not joining earlier.

That night, Du Xu bounced on their hotel bed, chanting: “We have a home!”

“Still excited?” Guan Yu emerged from the bathroom.

She launched into his arms. “You’ll catch me!” Remembering his life-saving catch during her forced suicide jump, she grinned.

“Silly girl.” He smiled into her hair.

“Yay! We’re homeowners!”

Hugging her, he inhaled milky sweetness. “Yes. Our home.”
