Chapter 3250: So Many Matters

His approach aimed to overwhelm through sheer numbers, creating an imposing spectacle. Arriving with over twenty disciples—though none particularly skilled—he sought dominance through quantity alone.

Yet when Elder Dai spoke up, Elder Xiang's expression soured. He shot her a helpless glance, restrained by the crowd from retorting openly.

Xuan Ming nodded, "Elder Dai makes a valid point. The true purpose of our Six Peaks Assembly is to select the most elite disciples for focused cultivation. Quality supersedes quantity. Fellow junior brothers should take heed of her wisdom."

As the leader who'd brought the most disciples from Zuo Kong Peak, Elder Xiang bristled at this consensus. "Elder Dai's view is flawed. While the Assembly does aim to nurture talent, allowing less skilled disciples to observe and learn through competition fosters growth. My numbers serve the disciples' benefit, not empty posturing."

"By that logic," Elder Dai countered coolly, "should we hold tournaments for every underperforming disciple in the sect? Those lacking cultivation need time, not premature defeats that might shatter their confidence. Forcing them into this arena does more harm than good."

"Are you deliberately targeting me?" Elder Xiang snapped. "You only brought ten disciples—perhaps because you've none worth presenting! I brought genuine talents!"

The atmosphere crackled as Elder Dai arched an eyebrow. "I merely state facts at the Sect Leader's request. If you consider your disciples competent, let tomorrow's trials reveal the truth. We'll see whether they're prize stallions or broken mules."

"Preposterous!" Elder Xiang's face reddened. "With twenty participants, at least one must advance!"

"Listen well, Sect Leader!" Elder Dai gestured theatrically. "This confirms my point—padding ranks with mediocrity rather than nurturing true talent!"

Xuan Ming intervened as tensions peaked. "Peace, both of you. Elder Xiang's disciples Wen Ming and A Cai show promise despite their playfulness."

Buoyed by this partial endorsement, Elder Xiang puffed up like a triumphant rooster. Elder Dai merely sighed, accustomed to his petty nature.

As discussions concluded, the participating disciples were tallied: seven from Qian Hui Peak, five from Xuan Zhong Peak, a dozen from Bamboo Forest Peak, and others from Tiger Head Peak. Though not overwhelming in number, three days would be needed to complete the elimination rounds.

Among the six peaks, Zuo Kong Peak was notoriously weak—mirroring their leader's lackluster cultivation. The strongest, Elder Lu of Qian Hui Peak, prioritized freedom over discipline, resulting in only Ma Xiao standing out among his disciples.

Notable talents included Si Qi and Shi Zhen from Ju He Peak, A Ze from Xuan Zhong Peak, and Zheng Xiao Zhi—son of Elder Zheng. As for Zuo Kong's disciples? Their reputation matched their master's: perennial underachievers.

Match pairings were soon displayed on Tiger Head Peak's central bulletin. The rules were straightforward: victors progressed through successive elimination rounds until four finalists emerged. Considerations for elemental affinities and spell counters were acknowledged, with a week-long challenge period allowing disputes after the semifinals.

Chapter 3251: Unbearable

The initial rounds passed without major upsets—mostly straightforward duels. By the third elimination, only eight disciples remained to compete for the final four spots.

Near the match board, Guan Yu walked ahead with Xiao Zhi and A Ze trailing like eager puppies. They intended to check Guan Yu's next opponent when they encountered Si Qi.

Xiao Zhi's entire demeanor brightened upon seeing the aloof beauty. Bounding forward like an excited puppy, he interrupted Guan Yu's greeting: "Si Qi! What fortune to meet you here! Are you hungry? Let me catch pheasants for you in the forbidden woods! The roast is divine!"

A Ze and Guan Yu exchanged pained looks. Surrounding male disciples glared—none more fiercely than Ling Su from Tiger Head Peak. The arrogant cultivator shoved Xiao Zhi. "You think being a peak elder's son impresses anyone? Keep away from Si Qi!"

Guan Yu recognized Ling Su—the disciple whose wrist he'd pierced months prior. Fully healed but no wiser, Ling Su sneered at Xiao Zhi's lovesick antics.

When Ling Su raised a fist, Guan Yu's voice cut through like winter wind: "Brother Ling Su, your wrist moves smoothly now. Quite...recovered."

The color drained from Ling Su's face as he spun toward Guan Yu. Memories of their last encounter resurfaced—the blade through bone, Sect Leader Xuan Ming's stern warnings about provoking this dangerous junior.

"G-Guan Yu!" Ling Su stammered, aborted spell flickering at his fingertips.

"Such swift healing," Guan Yu smiled, the expression chilling rather than warm. "One might think you'd learned caution."

Chapter 3252: Clean Work

Xiao Zhi, oblivious to the tension, kept babbling to Si Qi: "I'll craft you better trinkets! Look—" He produced a glass orb containing glowing fireflies, drawing gasps from female disciples.

Si Qi remained frosty. "I decline."

Undeterred, Xiao Zhi beamed. "I'll make another! Let's—"

Ling Su regained his bravado, shoving Xiao Zhi harder. "Deaf idiot! I said stay away!"

Xiao Zhi finally noticed his antagonist. "Brother Ling Su, unless urgent, let me—"

"I'll show you urgent!" Ling Su's hands blurred into spellcasting—until Guan Yu's dagger-point rested against his throat.

"Consider," Guan Yu murmured, "whether your wrist prefers remaining attached."

The crowd stilled. Even Si Qi's icy composure flickered at the lethal grace radiating from Guan Yu. Ling Su froze, sweat beading as he recalled Xuan Ming's warning: "That one walks with death in his shadow."

Xiao Zhi, finally recognizing danger, gulped. "Perhaps...another time for gifts?"

Guan Yu sheathed his blade with a smirk. "Wise choice." The unspoken warning hung heavier than any steel—a promise etched in the sudden silence.
