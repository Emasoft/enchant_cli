The red-haired man eyed these profit-driven individuals with suspicion, slightly furrowing his brows before a glint of sharpness flashed through his eyes.

*So you cunning bastards want to steal my credit? This achievement is mine alone. No one’s taking it!*

Shifting his stance slightly, the red-haired man positioned himself in front of the middle-aged man and drawled, “Third Brother, there’s no need for you to handle this one. Don’t force me to clash with you.”

“Fourth Brother, spare us the embarrassment with your meager skills,” retorted the middle-aged man, visibly irritated at being blocked.

“Ha! Seems Third Brother here looks down on people!” The red-haired man sneered coldly, his right finger suddenly darting toward the middle-aged man’s throat.

With a swift flick of his sleeve, the middle-aged man sidestepped, a metal ruler materializing in his hand as he swung it horizontally at the red-haired man.

**Chapter 1628: Leave After Being Crippled**

The bald man and the red-haired man erupted into a fierce brawl. Though the red-haired man’s finger techniques were uncanny, the middle-aged man’s mastery of the ruler suppressed him completely.

Watching this, the bald man could no longer remain idle. After being momentarily restrained earlier by the middle-aged man, he roared and charged forward. “Fourth Brother! I’ll aid you!”

*What the hell is going on?* Guan Yu frowned deeply. After exchanging only two moves with him, these men were now turning on each other?

“Brother Shadow, what’s happening with Brother Feng?” Wang Jun muttered in confusion, turning to the silent black-clad man beside him—only to find the man had vanished.

“Huh? Where’d Brother Shadow go?” Wang Jun frowned, realizing he hadn’t sensed the man’s disappearance.

While Wang Jun remained oblivious, Guan Yu knew. Initially puzzled by their sudden infighting, he understood once the bald man joined the fray.

*This is a diversion.*

Had Guan Yu not caught the fleeting exchange of glances among the trio earlier, he might have fallen for their deceit. But now, the game had changed.

Under the dim lights of the small plaza at night, a shadowy figure gradually materialized behind Guan Yu. A cold glint sliced silently toward his neck—a strike devoid of even the whisper of wind, betraying the attacker’s formidable skill.

Narrowing his eyes, Guan Yu smirked mockingly.

The four had always collaborated seamlessly, their cunning reaching exceptional heights. Realizing their internal energy was ineffective against Guan Yu’s robust physique, they knew brute force wouldn’t work. Thus, three distracted him while the fourth stealthily moved in for a decisive strike.

As the shadow appeared, a voice shouted from behind a tree at the plaza’s edge: “Watch out!”

The warning came from Xu Ying, who had followed Guan Yu out of the classroom but lost track of him. Hearing the commotion, she rushed over just in time to spot the assailant behind him.

At her cry, the shadow accelerated his dagger’s thrust, tripling its force. Initially holding back to avoid detection, he now unleashed full power.

Yet the attacker never anticipated Guan Yu’s reflexes. The young man’s fingers snapped up, clamping the blade mere inches from his skin.

Shocked, the shadow yanked at the dagger—but it remained immovable. Terror flashed across his face. Renowned for his ambushes, he prided himself on strength capable of lifting cars single-handedly. Yet Guan Yu’s grip dwarfed his own.

Accepting defeat, the shadow released the dagger and melted into the darkness. But Guan Yu wouldn’t let him escape so easily.

As the figure began to fade, Guan Yu snorted coldly. A ripple tore through the air, followed by a muffled groan and the splatter of blood.

In the same breath, Guan Yu hurled the dagger toward the three charging men. The middle-aged man at the forefront raised his ruler to block.

“Third Brother, don’t!” a hoarse voice barked urgently.

The man twisted aside, but the blade sheared through the ruler and gouged his right arm to the bone before embedding itself into a stone wall. Without the warning, his arm would have been severed.

“Hiss—”

The red-haired man and the bald man froze, aghast. They’d met their match.

The shadow reappeared beside them, eyeing the stunned Wang Jun before addressing Guan Yu with a stiff bow. “We admire your prowess as an异能者 (supernatural being). Would you grant our leader Mu Yun face and let us leave?”

Guan Yu frowned. “What face does Mu Yun deserve? Why should I spare him?”

The shadow’s jaw twitched. “What would it take for us to depart?”

“Simple.” Guan Yu gestured at Wang Jun and the twenty-odd men. “Leave after being crippled.”

The four exchanged uneasy glances. While the others were expendable, Wang Jun—Mu Yun’s nephew—posed a problem. Yet under Guan Yu’s icy gaze, the shadow gritted his teeth and lunged at Wang Jun. The others followed, turning the plaza into a chorus of screams.

Wang Jun received special attention, his mouth swollen grotesquely. Though injuries appeared severe, Guan Yu knew they were superficial—a performance for his benefit.

“We’ve fulfilled your demand. We’ll take our leave.” After maiming the group, the four bowed and turned to flee, eager to escape and regroup.

But Guan Yu blocked their path. “The ‘crippled’ includes you.”

Before they could react, he blurred into motion. Four sprays of blood later, the men clutched caved-in chests and fled.

To Xu Ying, watching from afar, Guan Yu had merely stood still as his foes collapsed. Wang Jun and his entourage limped away hastily.

“Trash.” Guan Yu scoffed, turning as Xu Ying approached.

She scrutinized him, brows knitted. “You’re... surprisingly capable.”

Guan Yu deflected, spotting the injured Yang Lin. “Let’s get him home.”

Xu Ying offered her family driver, but Guan Yu refused bluntly, earning her ire. “Ungrateful jerk!” she muttered as he departed.

Supporting Yang Lin, Guan Yu probed the boy’s internal injuries—multiple contusions. “Why serve Wang Jun?” he pressed as they entered a dilapidated neighborhood.

Yang Lin hesitated, then confessed: his father’s gambling debts, threats, and Wang Jun’s “rescue.” The loans came with strings—medical bills for his now-demented father. “I had no choice,” Yang Lin rasped, brandishing a银行卡 (bank card).

But Guan Yu sensed deception. “Did Wang Jun want something from you?”

Yang Lin stiffened. His family heirloom—a relic his father guarded obsessively—flashed through his mind.

“If you ever sell it, you’re no son of mine!” his father had once roared.

Yet Guan Yu’s question lingered as the boy vanished into the night.

**Chapter 1630: Mutation**

Alone, Guan Yu pondered. Yang Lin’s plight reeked of setup. That heirloom—perhaps more than it seemed.

As he wandered dim streets, unafraid of the darkness, an odd tension prickled the air. Something was amiss.
