Xue Jing shuddered after hearing the story, never imagining the Poisonous Widow could be such a vicious woman. "Killing that adulterous couple was one thing, but why murder her own child? The baby was innocent—her own flesh and blood!"

**Chapter 2751: Three More Arrive**

Jones added, "When consumed by extreme hatred, especially in that deranged state, people become capable of anything. The child in her womb belonged to that despicable man. Of course she resented it too—so she killed it."

Guanyu asked, "What happened afterward? How did she become one of the Ten Great Evils and rise to lead a cultivator organization? From an ordinary woman to this... it's unbelievable."

Xue Jing interjected, "What's so remarkable about her? Sister Jones is the true marvel! She transformed from a young girl into the leader of the Free Organization just to pursue you. All for the chance to find you again."

"Didn't you say Jones had a miraculous encounter that boosted her cultivation? Does the Poisonous Widow have one too?" Guanyu inquired curiously, realizing Xue Jing had inadvertently mentioned something he'd forgotten.

Jones indeed had her miracle—absorbing strands of internal energy emitted from Guanyu's body during their time in an Arctic ice cavern, which propelled her to her current heights.

Jones hastily explained, "My rapid cultivation growth came from that encounter. The Poisonous Widow must have had one too, though no one knows how she transformed. After the incident, she vanished. When she reappeared, she'd become the Poisonous Widow and gradually built the Dark Sun Organization."

Guanyu marveled at the Poisonous Widow's storied past.

With Shengsheng and Xiaobai likely arriving soon, Jones and Xue Jing could jointly handle the Poisonous Widow. Though the Free Organization might suffer losses against the Dark Sun forces, victory was assured. Guanyu awaited Xiaobai's arrival.

As he pondered, the boisterous voice of the burly monk echoed, "Move aside! You're blocking my path!"

Following the shout, Xiaobai's group reached Guanyu. Shengsheng asked, "Are we late?"

"Perfect timing," Guanyu replied.

The Poisonous Widow's faction observed the newcomers—three Second-Class Supreme cultivators. Had they been First-Class, retreat would have been inevitable. Now, the Widow wavered—if Guanyu was a Realm Sovereign, all was lost. If not, battle remained feasible despite potential losses.

The Widow proposed, "Guanyu, what if we exchange money for my nephew's hand? Name your price."

Guanyu chuckled. "You're in no position to bargain. The lightest punishment Fang Su faces tonight is losing a hand. Rest assured, I'll claim your gold regardless."

Sensing fear behind the offer, Guanyu remained unmoved. His forces now complete, he devised a bloodless strategy—just as three more figures approached, two dragging a captive between them.

Fang Su and the Widow turned to see Fang Family Head restrained. Despite earlier precautions, Guanyu's hidden agents had intercepted their escape attempt through the back door. Ganbili's team, mostly Hou Jinshun's men, had lain in wait as ordered.

Upon learning of the capture, Guanyu had the Family Head brought forward. Seeing his father bound, Fang Su recalled Feng Young Master's warning: "Guanyu is omnipotent. Opposing him blindly invites ruin." The truth rang painfully clear.

The Widow cursed, "Didn't I send escorts? How was he caught?" Slapping her forehead, she groaned, "Foolish oversight—underestimated him again."

Guanyu remarked, "Family Head Fang, long time no see. You've grown thinner." Though valuing filial piety, Guanyu used the elder purely as leverage.

"Release him immediately!" Guanyu feigned anger at his subordinates. The unlocked chains clanked—excessive restraints for an old man, but effective theater.

Guanyu addressed the Family Head, "More comfortable now? Stay awhile—your son and I have unfinished business." A nod sent the captive to stand nearby, within easy reach should negotiations fail.

**Chapter 2752: Severing a Hand**

With Xiaobai's trio tilting the balance and the Family Head secured, the Widow recognized impending defeat. Fang Su agonized—sacrifice his hand or condemn his father to losing both?

Guanyu issued an ultimatum: "Five minutes. Choose: your hand, or your father's hands."

Fang Su paced frantically until the Widow calmed him. "Not irreparable yet. We'll find a solution."

"Guanyu acts swiftly! Five minutes and he'll maim Father!" Fang Su hissed.

The Widow's mind raced—direct confrontation risked heavy losses. "Guanyu," she called, "Can't we negotiate alternatives?"

"My mercy ends at one hand," Guanyu coldly replied. "Be grateful I spare his life."

Fang Su knew Guanyu's cruelty. Losing a hand meant social death—no more charming noble ladies, only paid company. The psychological torture was calculated perfection.

"I'll pay two million! Keep the hand!" Fang Su blurted.

Guanyu shook his head. "Time's up." At his signal, guards forced the Family Head to kneel.

"Save me, son!" the elder wailed. "Order your aunt to seize Guanyu!"

The Widow whispered to Ah Gou: "On my signal, rescue the Family Head at all costs."

**Chapter 2753: Fight to the Death**

Fang Su eyed his hand, then his weeping father. "I'll trade my hand for Father's life!"

Guanyu applauded mockingly. "Noble sacrifice. Proceed, and he goes free."

"No!" the Family Head cried. "Take my hands instead! The Fang lineage needs you whole!"

The Widow had heard enough. "Attack!" she suddenly roared. Ah Gou lunged, snatching the Family Head and kicking a guard. As Dark Sun cultivators charged, the Widow retreated indoors with her nephews.

Chaos erupted. Jones and Xue Jing shielded Guanyu while Ah Gou's team fought to reclaim their leader. The night's fragile truce shattered into clashing steel and flying qi—the real battle begun.
