“Moreover, after witnessing the scene just now, Wu Zijun was absolutely certain that Guan Yu’s skills surpassed his own. Catching up would be extremely difficult.

Yet bound by his mission, Wu Zijun had no choice but to grit his teeth and pursue.

His mind was fully focused, nerves taut as he stared at the deadly curve ahead. His foot hovered delicately over the accelerator, meticulously controlling the speed.

Though slower than before, the car still raced far beyond normal limits—blisteringly fast in any ordinary person’s eyes.

Suddenly, he slammed the brakes and jerked the steering wheel. Leveraging inertia and the car’s shifting center of gravity, he executed a serviceable drift around the curve.

Of course, compared to Guan Yu’s earlier flawless maneuver, this drift was merely passable.

Wu Zijun sighed inwardly at the disparity.

Then, an abrupt change made his face blanch.

Mid-drift, the car inexplicably accelerated. No matter how hard he stomped the brakes, speed only surged.

“No!”

His desperate roar echoed as he and the car careened off the cliff.

Like a brilliant firework, the vehicle erupted in a thunderous explosion.

Until his dying breath, Wu Zijun couldn’t comprehend why his car had accelerated. Hadn’t he kept his foot on the accelerator?

Eyes wide in death!

Had he noticed, he might have sensed his car suddenly lightening while inertia remained unchanged—naturally causing uncontrolled acceleration toward the fatal plunge.

All this was Guan Yu’s handiwork.

Now standing pale and drained at the curve’s end, Guan Yu watched the blazing wreckage with a cold smirk.

He’d succeeded again, exploiting the wealthy clan’s familiarity with the terrain!

Had Wu Zijun cautiously taken the curve at normal speed, Guan Yu could never have struck. But the man’s overconfidence in his drifting skills had sealed his fate.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

After briefly confirming the result, Guan Yu returned to his car. Instead of chasing the far-ahead Wu Haojian, he retrieved two batons from the trunk to recharge.

The frantic pursuit had drained him—using scanning systems to map roads, gravity systems for pursuit and kills, even that mid-air drift relying on gravitational manipulation. Without shifting weight to the front via the system, he’d have plummeted to his death—precisely Wu Zijun’s undoing.

Recharged by three batons, Guan Yu groaned in relief, vitality restored.

He stretched lazily, unconcerned about Wu Haojian potentially finishing first, and dialed Lin Dong.

Before he could speak, complaints erupted: “Even a turtle wouldn’t be this slow!”

By implication, Lin Dong was calling him a turtle’s slower cousin—a bastard.

Having known Lin Dong long, Guan Yu immediately grasped the insult.

Fuming internally but maintaining a saccharine tone, Guan Yu said, “Little Lin, don’t fret! I’m coming! Did you block him?”

He couldn’t afford to provoke Lin Dong—currently intercepting Wu Haojian mid-race. Losing that help meant forfeiting the championship and 70 million yuan.

“The bastard’s impatient, mocking you as turtle-scum!” Lin Dong retorted before hanging up.

Guan Yu froze, then chuckled. Lin Dong had masterfully shifted the insult’s origin to Wu Haojian—utterly shameless.

Shaking his head, Guan Yu tossed his phone aside. The copper coin in his mind glowed blue—GRAVITY SYSTEM flared as invisible energy enveloped the car, reducing its weight by 60%.

The vehicle vanished in a blur, leaving swirling smoke.

Much later near Wu Zijun’s fatal curve, Wu Rui inched forward at snail’s pace before stopping.

Peering over the cliff, his face whitened.

“F***! Today’s cursed! Another damn crash! I’ll shut up—hope the others ahead aren’t all dead!”

Far ahead, two parked cars formed stark contrasts.

Lin Dong eyed Guan Yu’s vehicle, taunting, “Seen spendthrifts, none like you! Want your kids to be rich heirs?”

Guan Yu thumped his chest, “Brother’s got money! Besides—” his grin turned sly, “insurance covers repairs. Free thrills!”

Any insurer hearing this would weep.

As Lin Dong sneered, Guan Yu turned to the hostile Wu Haojian and lunged, pummeling him while roaring, “Call me bastard? I’ll beat you into one!”

Chapter 949: Fair Competition

Wu Haojian’s tragedy lay in being a racer, not a fighter. Even Long Tian could overpower him—let alone Guan Yu.

“My prisoner still dares sass me?” Guan Yu kicked the蜷缩 man. “I’ll pound you into turtle soup!”

Wu Haojian curled fetal, minimizing damage from the brutal blows.

If possible, he’d scream: “Bullshit! Who insulted you?!”

His ordeal began when a sudden boulder blocked his winning path. A stranger (Lin Dong) dragged him out, offering no explanation.

Attempts to radio his clan were thwarted—more beatings ensued. Waiting for Wu Zijun and Zhao Xing proved futile. Now this lunatic accused him of insults he never uttered.

When Guan Yu finally paused, he turned accusingly to Lin Dong: “We’re brothers! His insults tarnish you too—how could you endure it?”

Lin Dong眯起eyes dangerously. “You mean to say I’m next?”

Guan Yu stiffened—hit the mark. Years of suppressed frustration sought outlet, but confronting Lin Dong directly meant more beatings. Hence, Wu Haojian became the proxy.

Denying vehemently, Guan Yu changed subjects. Approaching the battered racer, he smiled: “Let me introduce myself—Guan Yu. Heard of me in your clan?”

Wu Haojian’s eyes widened. This was the man who’d thrown the Hao Clan into chaos!

“You’re Guan Yu?!”

The smirking man stroked his chin. “Seems I’m famous!”

Realization dawned—Wu Haojian gasped: “You killed Wu Zijun and Chen Xing!”

“Murder’s illegal,” Guan Yu feigned innocence. “But racing accidents... well, your chosen route’s perilous. Saw two idiots crash earlier—spectacular fireball!”

As Wu Haojian paled, Guan Yu offered: “I’ll grant you fair competition.”

Chapter 950: Dishonesty

“A fair chance,” Guan Yu repeated.

Baffled, Wu Haojian waited.

“I don’t kill, but can’t let you leave alive. Let’s wager.”

Wu Haojian remained wary—this killer’s words meant nothing.

“What wager?”

“Simple.” Guan Yu shrugged. “We race from here. Winner takes glory. Loser...” He trailed off meaningfully.

“A race?”

“Smart lad! We’ll bet our lives.”

Wu Haojian’s eyes lit—his only escape chance. Once in his car, his top-tier skills could outdrive Guan Yu. Maybe even orchestrate an “accident.”

He never considered Guan Yu might be better.
