When Guan Yu saw Lin Dong, he immediately noticed Wan Qianshan. However, his lingering resentment toward Lin Dong's earlier manipulations momentarily pushed Wan Qianshan to the background. After all, with Wan Qianshan pinned beneath Lin Dong's foot, there was no escape.

“Hand him over to me?” Guan Yu tentatively asked.

“What the hell would I want with a man? He’s yours.” Lin Dong curled his lip and casually kicked Wan Qianshan toward Guan Yu as if booting a soccer ball.

A flicker of surprise crossed Guan Yu’s eyes. Lin Dong’s strength far exceeded his expectations.

He nodded gratefully at Lin Dong.

Though still irritated, Guan Yu understood Lin Dong had deliberately aided him. Capturing Wan Qianshan alive was the clearest proof.

With Zhou Jin dead and Wan Qianshan apprehended, the crisis in N City had been averted. Yet the score between him and Wan Qianshan remained unsettled.

**Chapter 664: A Piece of Advice for You**

Wan Qianshan had fallen utterly, reduced to a fish on the chopping block at Guan Yu’s mercy.

Crouching down, Guan Yu studied Wan Qianshan with amused interest. “I took five bullets. Not exactly pleasant. What do you suggest I do about that?”

As Wan Qianshan tried to rise, Guan Yu kicked him back down. “I haven’t finished. Who said you could stand?”

The once-mighty Taiwanese underworld kingpin, unaccustomed to such humiliation, glared venomously. “I’ve lost. If you’re a real man, finish this cleanly. Stop dilly-dallying!”

“How novel!” Guan Yu chuckled coldly. “Where was this grand bravado earlier? You shot me, schemed to torture me, even targeted my woman.” His tone turned glacial on the last words, stoking his fury.

Wan Qianshan opened his mouth, tempted to blame Zhou Jin. But Zhou Jin’s actions had his tacit approval. As for being “decisive”—he hardly had the right to demand it.

“What? Planning to claim Zhou Jin did it all? That you’re blameless?” Guan Yu pressed.

Wan Qianshan remained silent.

“Deny it all you want. I know the truth. But he’s dead now—killed by you. You stole my chance for revenge. So his debts fall to you.” Guan Yu’s logic was merciless.

Wan Qianshan’s chest tightened—Guan Yu was twisting reason itself.

Guan Yu squatted, gaze impassive. “Because of you, Xiao Xiong’s empire nearly collapsed. Because of you, N City descended into chaos—deaths, injuries, comas. By rights, I should slice you to ribbons for harming those I hold dearest. But then I thought—wouldn’t death be too kind? Shouldn’t you leave something behind for those you’ve wronged?”

“What do you want?” Wan Qianshan ground out.

Guan Yu grinned. “I do love dealing with smart men.”

He reached for a cigarette, found none, then caught the pack and lighter Lin Dong tossed him. Lighting up, he blew smoke into Wan Qianshan’s face. “My history’s rusty, but I recall that thriftless old woman (Cixi, the Empress Dowager) who let foreigners humiliate China while signing unequal treaties. Let’s skip judging her. The lesson? When you start a fight and lose, you can’t just shout ‘I’ll be back in eighteen years!’ and walk away. Compensation’s due—for damages and emotional distress.”

The realization struck Wan Qianshan—Guan Yu meant to play imperialist, demanding tribute.

“If I pay, you’ll spare me?” Wan Qianshan sneered.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Depends on my mood.”

Wan Qianshan’s eye twitched. “Take my wealth and my life? Guan Yu, I’ll die before surrendering a cent!”

“‘Die’?” Guan Yu’s smile turned eerie. “There are ways to die.”

A chill crawled through Wan Qianshan’s bones.

In one fluid motion, Guan Yu drew a pistol and shot his thigh without blinking. “Death can be simple... or not. Did Zhou Jin describe Qian Tong’s end? Let’s just say yours will be... harder.”

Agony drenched Wan Qianshan in sweat. Zhou Jin’s report on Qian Tong’s fate echoed: *Unspeakable. A fate worse than death.* Yet the kingpin clenched his teeth.

“Stubborn.” Guan Yu snorted. “Here’s advice: stop posturing. Hear my terms—comply, and maybe you live.”

Wan Qianshan stayed silent, distrusting every word.

Guan Yu mused aloud: “Without Zhou Jin or Huang Ming, that massive Taiwanese pie must be indigestible. Let me help.”

Wan Qianshan’s pupils contracted. “You want my entire Taiwanese empire?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Trading power for life? You’re getting a bargain.”

“Your ambition astounds,” Wan Qianshan spat.

“Yours was grander.”

“Think you can swallow it without choking?”

“My concern. With your cooperation, the rest is manageable.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Do you fear death?” Guan Yu countered.

Wan Qianshan scoffed. “Fear wouldn’t have brought me this far.”

“You fear it.” Guan Yu’s gaze pierced. “Else why the army of bodyguards?”

“So what?” Wan Qianshan stiffened, exposed.

“Yield your empire, and live.” Guan Yu leaned close. “Refuse, and I’ll make you beg for death.”

“Enough games!” Wan Qianshan snapped.

He knew: stripped of power, even spared, his enemies would tear him apart. Better death than surrender.

“Then die.” Guan Yu turned away.

Lin Dong interjected: “Perhaps I’ll offer advice too?”

**Chapter 665: The Puppet**

Guan Yu never fully grasped Lin Dong’s motives—first an assassin, then a savior twice over. Still, he felt genuine gratitude toward this enigmatic youth.

“Advice?” Guan Yu raised an eyebrow.

“Keep him. Let him manage Taiwan for you.”

“A puppet, like he used others?”

Lin Dong nodded. “Taiwan’s too vast to swallow whole. But through him? He knows the landscape. Efficient.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up—control without the struggle. Yet doubt lingered. “He’s a viper. What if he strikes back?”

“You’re the expert in control.” Lin Dong’s smile hinted at secrets.

“Me? I’m no sorcerer!”

“Use what you did to Qian Tong.”

Guan Yu paled. “You know about that?”

“Saw it by accident.” Lin Dong shrugged.

“You followed me?”

“If you insist.”

Cold sweat prickled Guan Yu’s neck—Lin Dong had shadowed him undetected, despite his surveillance system.

“Park Xu left China. Why still track me?”

Lin Dong rolled his eyes. “If I wanted you dead, you’d be dust.”

Guan Yu forced a laugh.

His mind raced—if not assassination, why the surveillance?

Suddenly, a theory struck him. He eyed Lin Dong strangely.

“What?” Lin Dong bristled.

“You’re not... I mean, I prefer women. Several, actually.”

Lin Dong’s face darkened.

Guan Yu backpedaled. “Just a thought! If you’re into that, I know great candidates—”

“Still want Taiwan?” Lin Dong cut in sharply.

“Absolutely.” Guan Yu refocused on Wan Qianshan, forgotten during the exchange.

The fallen kingpin seethed. “I’ll never be your puppet!”

Guan Yu smiled predatorily. “Too early for declarations. Let’s revisit this tomorrow... with *persuasion*.”

“Why wait? Do it now.” Lin Dong insisted.

“I only have one black widow spider.”

“Use more.”

“Eager spectator, aren’t you?”

“Wouldn’t want to delay your grand plans.”

Guan Yu snorted. “Fine. Fetch me five black widows.”

“At night? You do it.”

“No? Then tomorrow. Can’t command animals magically. Want a show? Help out!”

Grudgingly, Lin Dong left, returning with five spiders.

“Too cold here.” Guan Yu gestured to the villa. “This’ll take time.”

“What about me?” Chu Hong, silent until now, finally spoke.

Guan Yu considered. “This isn’t for you. Drive home. I’ll find you tomorrow.”

Reluctantly, she left.

**Chapter 666: Lin Dong’s Plan**

Nothing comes free. For his front-row seat, Lin Dong hauled Wan Qianshan into the villa, dumping him onto a table.

Guan Yu displayed the spiders. “Meet my black widows. I’ll feed them to you—one by one. Still feeling stubborn?”

Wan Qianshan’s stomach churned.

“No answer?” Guan Yu nodded to Lin Dong, who punched Wan Qianshan into submission.

As Guan Yu positioned a spider, Lin Dong asked: “Their venom’s lethal. Sure he’ll survive?”

“If they don’t bite. Controlled.”

“You can do that?”

“How else did twenty men die without firing shots?”

“But how?”

Guan Yu feigned nonchalance. “Trade secret.”

The unspoken truth hummed between them—a game within games, power beyond ordinary means. Yet the dance continued, spiders hovering as Wan Qianshan’s defiance wavered...
