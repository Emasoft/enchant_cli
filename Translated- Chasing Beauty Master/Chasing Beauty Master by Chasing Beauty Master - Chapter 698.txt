Guan Yu surveyed the classroom. Of the forty-some students, most were girls with only a dozen boys. The vacant seats consisted of two desks at the back and another beside Lyu Mei in the middle row.

He walked to his seat and sat down, glancing sideways at his deskmate. His breath caught. Such beauty! Her complexion resembled freshly beaten egg whites, features flawlessly sculpted. How could any human be this exquisite? Her skin looked positively edible.

"Hello deskmate," Guan Yu flashed a dazzling smile, revealing perfect white teeth. "I'm Guan Yu. Looking forward to learning together."

Lyu Mei remained expressionless but silently shook his extended hand.

"Holy shit! That bastard touched my goddess! I'll kill him!"

"Damned newbie! How dare he hold her hand on the first day! My pure goddess is defiled!"

Male students glared daggers at Guan Yu through the morning classes. When noon bell rang, Xue Jing appeared at the classroom door.

"Whoa! A super lolita beauty! Since when did our school hide this stunner?"

Guan Yu approached the doorway. "Let's eat at the cafeteria," Xue Jing chirped. "Haven't had school food in ages!"

Nodding, Guan Yu followed her out. Lyu Mei watched his departing figure, her thoughts unreadable.

The cafeteria resembled a luxury hotel - fifty floors with thousands of private dining rooms. Xue Jing suggested their usual private suite, but Guan Yu chose the bustling main hall. As Xue Jing went to order, a gruff voice barked behind them:

"You're the new kid from Class 1?"

Guan Yu turned to face a hulking foreign student towering two meters tall, a full head above his 180cm frame.

"Listen punk," the giant growled. "However connected you are, stay away from Lyu Mei. She's mine."

"Her being your crush concerns me how?" Guan Yu retorted. "Get lost. You're ruining my appetite."

"Brave words! Cross me and you'll regret it!"

Guan Yu's temper flared. School memories flooded back - endless provocations every damn enrollment. As he prepared to strike, Xue Jing's fiery voice cut through:

"Scram, maggot! Threaten my man again and I'll gather sisters to crush your balls! Now beat it before you ruin MY appetite!"

The foreigner gaped at the petite spitfire. "You'll pay for this!" he spat before retreating.

"My little tigress strikes again," Guan Yu teased over lunch.

"Flatterer," Xue Jing tapped his head with chopsticks. "Though this 'Lyu Mei'... Did you flirt with some beauty and get her boyfriend chasing you?"

"Just my deskmate! Spoke one sentence all morning. No clue why morons target me."

"Even memory-loss can't cure your womanizing," she laughed. "Finish up."

Returning early, Guan Yu found a military-stern man guarding Class 1. Inside, Lyu Mei nibbled from a lacquered lunchbox.

"School serves delicacies. Why bring homemade?" Guan Yu asked.

"My father insists outside food's unsafe," she replied, dabbing her rosebud lips. "Wang Shu delivers it."

The guard entered at her signal, collected the empty container, bowed, and exited.

"Your bodyguard's got style," Guan Yu grinned, ignoring cafeteria warnings.

Lyu Mei smiled. "Wang Shu's been my driver-guard since elementary..."

BOOM! The door crashed open. The foreigner returned with four lackeys.

"There's the bastard cozying with MY Lyu Mei! Break his jaws!" he roared.

Guan Yu smirked at Lyu Mei. "Your boyfriend?"

"JOHN QIAO!" She sprang up furious. "I'm NOT yours! Spread that lie again and I'll end you! Get OUT!"

Undeterred, Qiao lunged. His meaty hand seized Guan Yu's collar... and failed to budge him. A wild punch aimed at Guan Yu's head met empty air as he leaned back. Twisting Qiao's wrist until he yelped, Guan Yu kicked him flying into desks.

The hulk rose shakily, left arm dangling. "GET HIM!" he bellowed.

"Wait!" Guan Yu raised a hand. Qiao grinned, anticipating surrender.

"You brought money?"

The room froze. Even Lyu Mei blinked.

"What trick is this?!" Qiao spat.

"If you've cash to replace broken desks, let's brawl. No money? Fight after school. Can't disrupt classes."

"Fuck your desks!" Qiao roared. "My money's for your hospital bills!"

[Chapter 1772: Rebirth]

Guan Yu lay motionless. The demon-toothed beast hesitated, cowed by the swirling demon core above. Jones pounced, flaming fangs sinking into its neck.

The beast howled, crushing Jones' body. Five spirit cores formed a pentagram above, holy light searing demon flesh. With last strength, the demon hurled Jones' corpse at the five spirit bears, extinguishing their light.

Only Xue Jing remained, her body nearly fully materialized above the ice altar. The demon lunged... as the Genesis Pearl blazed. Arctic blue light shattered the altar, revealing an azure crystal.

"THE PRIME WATER ESSENCE!" the demon gasped. Before it could react, Xue Jing's voice rang crystalline:

"You... killed them?"

Transformed, she floated divine and terrible. The demon quailed - here stood a goddess reborn.
