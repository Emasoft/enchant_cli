Guan Yu patiently persuaded Jiang Xin, using Chu Fan as a deterrent. He fully sensed Jiang Xin's feelings toward him, but he absolutely could not accept her affections. Were it not for his connection to Chu Fan, he might have considered it. Yet facing Chu Fan's existence, Guan Yu believed maintaining distance from Jiang Xin would be best for everyone.

At the mention of Chu Fan, Jiang Xin visibly calmed. Her large eyes blinked silently at Guan Yu, her thoughts inscrutable. Even Guan Yu found himself unable to decipher the complex emotions flickering behind her gaze—a mixture of sorrow, reluctance, hesitation, and pity far beyond her youthful appearance.

Young girls embroiled in matters of the heart often grew sentimental, especially someone as guileless as Jiang Xin. When such girls fell in love, they expressed it through unwavering devotion rather than words or actions.

“But if it’s so dangerous, why can Duan Ruxue go with you?” Jiang Xin steadied her voice and pressed.

Guan Yu frowned. “How did you even learn about this? You’ve been staying indoors—who told you Ruxue is joining us?”

“She told me herself and even asked if I wanted to come.” Jiang Xin explained, “Two days ago, she sent someone to visit. We chatted, and she mentioned accompanying your group to the Far North to find the Eastern Sea. She hoped I’d join as her companion. If she—an ordinary girl without martial skills—can go, why can’t I?”

Guan Yu nodded, finally understanding. So it was Duan Ruxue’s instigation that fueled Jiang Xin’s insistence. “We aren’t bringing her by choice. Only she knows the Eastern Sea’s location. Without her guidance, we’d never find it. The place lies in her grandfather’s homeland, which is why we must involve the Duan family. You’ve misunderstood, Miss Jiang. As for dangers along the journey—Ruxue faces unavoidable risks, but you needn’t subject yourself to them. We dissuade you for your own safety, not to control you.”

He wondered if his words had reached her. If only Chu Fan were present—Jiang Xin always heeded his counsel. Without a word, Jiang Xin turned and retreated indoors, leaving Guan Yu sighing in frustration.

The once-open girl who shared every thought with Chu Fan or the Empress Dowager had become withdrawn, locking her heart away. Her transformation bewildered Guan Yu. Where she once radiated cheerful simplicity, now lingered shadows of unspoken turmoil.

**Chapter 5030: Satisfaction**

Jiang Xin’s childhood security had stemmed from her father Jiang Yuankai and the Empress Dowager. Now grown, she found solace only in Wan Hong’s presence—a towering reassurance that even collapsing heavens couldn’t breach. Lately, her mind churned with confusion. Did she love Wan Hong? His face haunted her dreams, his vow “Don’t fear, I’ll take you home” etched into her soul.

Yet this conflicted with her fading enthusiasm for Chu Fan. She couldn’t reconcile these emotions, nor face Chu Fan’s inevitable reaction. Guan Yu sympathized—Jiang Xin’s pure-heartedness made her universally cherished—but as Chu Fan’s sworn brother, he must maintain distance. Even if she and Chu Fan parted, closeness with her would jeopardize his bond with Chu Fan.

Duan Ruxue bore partial blame for stoking Jiang Xin’s rebelliousness. Shaking his head, Guan Yu approached the newly rebuilt Hongyan Theater—a towering edifice dominating the street.

**Chapter 5031: Planning Ahead**

Near the entrance, Chu Fan and the deputy manager debated signage. “Size isn’t everything,” Chu Fan insisted. “A metal plaque with gold-edged bronze characters would outshine mere bulk.”

The deputy countered, “Wood suffices if it’s large enough to match our grand archway.”

“You’re both wrong,” Guan Yu interjected. Inside, he admired the renovated theater—modernized with tiered seating and VIP boxes near the stage, abandoning traditional elevated platforms. Fixed chairs now ensured orderly seating, while premium front-row spots and seven private balconies offered optimal views.

“Our losses now are investments for future profits,” Guan Yu reassured Chu Fan, noting the recovering troupe members. When offered tea, he chuckled, “Water’s enough. Now, about that plaque…”

**Chapter 5032: A Novel Approach**

“Instead of one massive sign,” Guan Yu proposed, “forge four two-meter characters mounted on the eaves—‘Hongyan Theater’ gleaming from every corner. At height, their scale would impress without overwhelming.”

The deputy gaped. “Characters on rooftops? Unheard of!”

“Anchored properly, they’ll withstand winds,” Guan Yu assured. “Let me sketch the vision.” His designs promised to transform the theater’s façade into a landmark as revolutionary as its interior—a beacon heralding Hongyan’s bold new era.
