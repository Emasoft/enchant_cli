“You despicable villains! How dare you poison the tea? Utterly shameless!” The captain roared through gritted teeth, sweat beading on his forehead.

“Hahaha! Blame your own blindness for daring to drink tea in our territory,” the Demon Soul Sect’s altar master chuckled before coldly ordering, “Brothers, beat them senseless first, then bind them all. Don’t kill them—these fools will fetch a hefty ransom.”

Contrary to his brutish appearance—thick beard and burly frame—the altar master proved cunning. Though many Crimson Lotus Sect members had avoided the poisoned tea and fought back valiantly, their resistance was futile. Only a dozen remained unpoisoned; the rest could barely stand, let alone cast spells.

The Demon Soul Sect disciples swarmed forward, pummeling the captain before subduing and binding everyone.

“Should we help the Crimson Lotus Sect?” Si Qi whispered to Guan Yu. “We can’t let them be captured!”

“We stay out of this,” Guan Yu replied impassively. “This is none of our concern.”

“But the Crimson Lotus is a righteous sect! Turning a blind eye feels wrong,” Si Qi pressed, though she knew Guan Yu’s word was final.

“They brought this upon themselves,” Guan Yu said coldly. “Had they not stalked us, they’d have avoided this fate.”

“Exactly! Let them suffer for wasting our time,” Xiao Mei added with a smirk.

Si Qi studied Guan Yu. “You knew this was Demon Soul Sect territory all along, didn’t you?”

“I recognized their insignia when we arrived,” Guan Yu admitted. “But they pose no threat if we avoid provoking them. Intervening would only force a bloody confrontation.”

As they turned to leave, a voice barked, “Halt! Who are you?”

Guan Yu tensed. “Stay silent,” he warned, especially glaring at Xiao Mei.

“We’re merely travelers resting here,” Guan Yu answered calmly, facing the portly altar master. “We’ve paid for our tea. Is there an issue?”

The altar master leered at Xiao Mei and Si Qi. “What brings such beauties to this wasteland?”

“This is our cult master,” Guan Yu gestured to Xiao Mei, “and my betrothed. We mean no trouble.”

“A cult master?” The man roared with laughter. “You expect me to believe this delicate girl leads a sect?”

“Doubt me?” Xiao Mei stepped forward, eyes flashing. “Challenge me, then!”

“Feisty! If you lose, you’ll warm my bed,” the altar master sneered, weaving spell sigils.

Xiao Mei barely conjured a shield before a dark mist coalesced above him, morphing into a massive sword that shattered her defense. She crumpled, blood staining her lips.

“Had enough?” The altar master gloated. “Surrender quietly.”

Instead, Xiao Mei’s form rippled—she transformed into a towering serpent, tail lashing out twin wind blades. Caught off guard, the altar master was hurled backward.

“I yield!” he spat, dusting himself off. “Take your vile serpent form and begone!”

“Our deal stands,” Xiao Mei hissed, human again. “Lick. My. Boots.”

“Enough,” Guan Yu interjected. “We depart now.”

As tensions simmered, the altar master’s disciples stirred restlessly. Guan Yu’s hand drifted toward his blade, ready to act—but for now, diplomacy held.

Avoiding conflict wasn’t cowardice but prudence. Guan Yu bowed slightly. “We’re from the Jiayi Cult, passing through. Our apologies for the disturbance.”

“Jiayi Cult?” The altar master frowned until an underling whispered, “A minor desert sect, Master.”

“Leave then,” the man grunted, though his gaze lingered hungrily on the women.

**Chapter 4597: No Easy Victory**

Xiao Mei’s serpentine triumph proved fleeting. As the humiliated altar master regrouped, Guan Yu knew this respite was temporary—the true storm loomed ahead.
