“Brother Hong Ren, you’ve arrived just in time. Come here—let me introduce you.” Wang Xiaorong called out first, then pointed at Qiqi.

Hong Ren glanced bewildered at Qiqi and the old man, neither of whom he had ever seen before, their identities a mystery.

Guanyu chuckled. “Allow me to make introductions. This is my sworn brother, Hong Ren. The young lady here is called Qiqi.”

Lowering his voice, Guanyu added, “This young lady was chosen by Xiaorong for you. What do you think?”

Hong Ren and Qiqi exchanged glances. Qiqi had not expected Brother Lao Cang’s sworn brother to be… like this. While his appearance was striking—a fitted martial outfit accentuating his muscular frame, fiery red hair making him stand out, tall and undeniably handsome—she inexplicably sensed an air of frivolity about him.

If given a choice, Qiqi would have preferred Brother Lao Cang, who radiated a steadier sense of security.

The old man scrutinized Hong Ren. Though the young man seemed decent, he shared Qiqi’s impression: unreliable, even unsafe. Perhaps years as a mountain bandit had ingrained a roguish aura into Hong Ren’s very presence.

“Heh, you’ve all gone to such trouble for me. Truly unnecessary—I’m content as I am,” Hong Ren said with a grin. Though Qiqi’s delicate charm was undeniable, his heart remained tethered to the woman he’d loved since childhood.

No matter how beautiful others might be, none stirred him. He preferred his life on the mountain with six hundred brothers—unburdened by romantic ties. Loneliness held no terror for him; companionship aplenty filled his days.

Guanyu pressed, “Hong Ren, mark my words—Qiqi is a rare gem. Miss this chance, and you may never find such a girl again. Raised by her grandparents, she’s been obedient and sensible since childhood, never causing them worry. We’ve found you a partner truly suited for life’s journey. Don’t throw this away.”

Qiqi remained silent, her disinterest in the red-haired man palpable. Though aware he wasn’t wicked, her first impression had settled like unshakable frost.

Guanyu persisted, “Don’t dismiss this yet. Why not spend time together? If it doesn’t work, no one will force it. What say you?”

The old man approached. “Young man, I’m Qiqi’s grandfather. First—why is your hair red?” The crimson locks unsettled him, suggesting disreputable origins.

“I’ve had it since childhood. Made me… different,” Hong Ren replied earnestly, his courtesy hinting at budding interest.

“What do you do? Why are you here?” the grandfather pressed.

Guanyu’s heart sank—revealing Hong Ren’s bandit identity would doom everything. But too late:

“I lead six hundred brothers on Red Name Mountain,” Hong Ren declared proudly.

“Bandit chief who robs merchant caravans?” The old man sighed. “Qiqi, we’re leaving.”

As the pair turned to go, Hong Ren stared at Guanyu, stung by the rejection.

Guanyu rushed to explain, but the grandfather countered, “We’ve traveled widely as performers. Once, your men extorted silver from us near Red Name Mountain. I’ll never let my granddaughter marry a bandit.”

Xiaorong glared. “You claimed to only target merchants! Shame on you!”

Hong Ren scratched his head. “I ordered only caravans robbed. My men overstepped—I apologize.” He offered compensatory silver, but the grandfather refused.

Guanyu admonished, “Discipline your men better. After this crisis, reform them.”

“I will,” Hong Ren vowed. “Any who disobey will be cast out.”

Guanyu turned to Qiqi. “This was a misunderstanding. Hong Ren’s character is sound—I guarantee it.”

Xiaorong interjected bitterly, “Some fates cannot be forced. You may leave.”

As the grandfather departed, Qiqi suddenly took Hong Ren’s silver. “Brother Lao Cang, may this be martial arts tuition?”

Guanyu hesitated—his imminent desert mission left no time. Xiaorong suggested, “Learn from Hong Ren instead!”

“Grandfather forbids bandit contact,” Qiqi stated bluntly.

Hong Ren shrugged—a lifetime of scorn had thickened his skin.

“I’ll teach you,” Guanyu relented. “Keep your silver—wealth I lack not.”

Qiqi’s eyes sparkled. “Are you truly rich?”

“Beyond imagining,” Guanyu smiled, devising a plan. To the grandfather: “Join our caravan guarding the prince to the capital. Ten silver daily for both of you.”

“Ten?!” Qiqi gasped. The sum could fund her grandmother’s medicine for months.

After urgent discussion, the old man sighed. “Qiqi may stay. But care for your grandmother…”

Hooves thundered as Zou Wuhei arrived. “Lao Cang! The city lord’s sealed his mansion—he’s making his move!”

Guanyu rallied his men. “To the city lord’s residence! We’ll breach it if needed!”

As the entourage charged forth, Qiqi watched their dust. “Who is Brother Lao Cang, Grandfather? Even officials fear him.”

“A formidable Jianghu man,” the grandfather mused. “But the silver… and your safety…”

Qiqi squeezed his calloused hands. “Let me try. I’ll return skilled and wealthy.”

The old man nodded slowly. As their cart creaked homeward, he omitted his usual performance critique. Tonight’s drama had surpassed any stage play.
