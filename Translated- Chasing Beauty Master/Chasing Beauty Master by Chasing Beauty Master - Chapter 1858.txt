“We can’t just leave that treasure unclaimed, can we? If Jiang Yuankai finds it first, we’ll be in deep trouble.” Master Cao stroked his beard gravely. “We merchants already dance on imperial strings. Should the court obtain the East Sea’s riches, they’ll devour our great families whole. They’ll never tolerate potential threats like us.”

Master Qin sipped his tea leisurely. “Your concern is valid, Brother Cao, but haste serves no purpose. The East Sea’s treasure isn’t easily found—no whispers of its location have surfaced. When the Grand Princess begins her search, her son-in-law’s household guards won’t suffice. She’ll inevitably seek the palace’s elite troops.”

“Yu Kong’s elite guard remains closest to her,” he continued. “My connections there assure me no movements have been detected. This silence proves the Grand Princess hasn’t stirred. We needn’t rush.”

The teacup clinked as Master Qin set it down. “Consider this—if Wan Hong had truly found that world-shaking treasure, would he have casually gifted the East Sea Dragon Pearl? Its absence from his hands suggests failure.”

“Fool!” Master Cao slammed his fist. “Were I in his place, I’d guard that pearl with my life! Only a simpleton parts with such power.”

“Perhaps strategy guides his actions.” Master Qin’s eyes narrowed. “By publicly bestowing the pearl upon Lady Jiang, he cleverly enlists the Imperial Son-in-Law’s resources. Let others exhaust themselves searching while he waits.”

A new thought struck Master Cao. “Wasn’t the Dragon Pearl stolen by demonic realm creatures decades ago? With both the former martial alliance leader and his beloved Qiao Beauty gone, why does it resurface now?”

Master Qin’s fingers stilled on his cup. “You raise an intriguing point. Though I’ve never seen those fiends myself, historical records confirm their theft. This sudden reappearance...” His voice dropped. “Could Wan Hong be their agent? What if the demonic realm, failing to unlock the treasure themselves, sent him bearing the pearl to manipulate mortal seekers?”

“You suggest he’s a demon?” Master Cao’s chopsticks clattered to the table.

“Not necessarily. The demonic realm might employ human puppets.” Master Qin leaned forward. “Imagine—he delivers the pearl to Jiang Yuankai, knowing the court’s resources will scour the seas. Once the treasure surfaces, demonic forces strike to claim it.”

Though skeptical, Master Cao’s greed overpowered reason. “Then why the public spectacle? Had Wan Hong secretly gifted the pearl, their search could proceed undisturbed.”

“Chaos serves their ends.” Master Qin spread his hands. “But these are mere conjectures. Without proof...”

A dangerous glint entered Master Cao’s eyes. “Elder Brother Qin... what if we collaborated?”

When Master Qin shook his head, the younger merchant pressed: “You know my mind—abduct Jiang Xin. As the Imperial Son-in-Law’s precious daughter and the Emperor’s darling niece, they’d trade the Dragon Pearl for her safety.”

“Madness!” Master Qin’s cup slammed down. “She’s a royal princess exempt from imperial decorum! Any move against her risks extermination—not just for us, but our entire clans!”

“True ambition fears no risk!”

“Not fear—caution!” Master Qin countered. “The Dragon Pearl’s resurgence is too recent. Should Jiang Xin vanish now, suspicion falls instantly on Kyoto’s Four Great Families. The Emperor already chafes at our influence—this would gift him justification for purges.”

Reluctant logic tempered Master Cao’s fervor. Protecting Jiang Xin suddenly seemed prudent—until rivals moved against her.

Chapter 4884: Impatience

Though verbally acquiescing, schemes churned behind Master Cao’s obedient nod. That night, pacing his manor’s moonlit corridors, he reasoned: The Dragon Pearl must still reside with Jiang Yuankai. While Master Qin advocated patience, delay risked losing the prize to quicker rivals.

‘Thirty years of humiliation under imperial boots...’ His fist clenched. ‘This chance won’t repeat.’ Detailed plans unfolded—track Jiang Xin’s movements, dispatch her guards, smuggle her beyond Kyoto’s walls. With the pearl secured, whether finding the treasure or selling the artifact itself, the Cao Clan would rise supreme.

Chapter 4885: Through Fire and Water

Dawn found Master Cao dispacing spies to Jiang Xin’s favorite haunts. Meanwhile, unaware of his ally’s betrayal, Master Qin contemplated solo acquisition of the pearl.

Elsewhere, Lady Qin’s wrath burned. Her nephew Qu Hua’s brutal beating demanded vengeance. Bypassing her cautious husband, she summoned the household’s veteran steward.

“Steward Ma,” she addressed the bowing figure, “you’ve served three generations. Will you lead sixty guards to crush this Wan Hong?”

The old retainer’s brows furrowed. “My lady, the assailant’s skill surpasses our numbers. To ensure victory, we need a hundred men—including ten masters.”

Lady Qin’s jade hairpin quivered with frustration. “Then make it so! But quietly—the master mustn’t know.”

Chapter 4886: Preparations

As Steward Ma departed to muster forces, Lady Qin failed to notice her husband observing from shadowed corridors. Master Qin’s smile held winter’s chill—while others scrambled for pearls and vengeance, deeper currents moved beneath Kyoto’s glittering surface.
