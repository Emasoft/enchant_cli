A bone-chilling, hair-raising sound echoed as Guan Yu mercilessly severed the centipede’s leg. The snap of bone seemed more terrifying than the girl’s earlier screams. The man howled, “Ah…my leg…ah!”

In truth, Guan Yu had struck with the blunt edge of his machete—intent only on breaking the leg to teach a lesson, avoiding excessive gore.

Students crowding the corridor watched Guan Yu as though he were a death god from hell. No one dared speak or intervene.

Guan Yu gazed coldly at the centipede writhing on the floor, clutching his mangled leg. Such scum deserved punishment. Tossing aside the machete, he declared, “This is your fate. Try standing and provoking me again, and I’ll cripple your other leg. Believe it.”

Watching the man’s agony, Guan Yu felt no pity. This was a dog-eat-dog world. Had their positions reversed, his plight would’ve been far worse. Mercy now would breed greater troubles later—just like with Chen Maosheng.

The centipede trembled in fear, finally understanding Guan Yu’s ruthless reputation. If even Chen Maosheng’s hundred-strong mob had failed, his own bravado had been suicidal.

“Brother Guan…Lord Guan! I was wrong!” the centipede babbled, clutching his leg. “Spare me! I’ll never dare cross you again! Wherever you go, I’ll crawl away! Please, have mercy!”

Having achieved his purpose, Guan Yu warned, “Remember your words. Break them, and both legs get replaced.”

“I swear! Thank you, Lord Guan!” The centipede kowtowed through gritted teeth.

With this settled, Guan Yu’s next target was Xiao Gen, Ran Qiang’s former lackey—but that could wait. “Let’s go,” he ordered Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo. The crowd parted like reeds before them. Once gone, whispers erupted: “Guan Yu’s unstoppable now. The centipede ruled through cruelty, but met someone crueler.”

Across Kaihuang Academy and A City’s elite circles, Guan Yu’s name now carried divine weight. Even his followers Wei and Jia commanded fear.

The collapse of the Heroes’ Alliance left many adrift. Though urged to form his own faction to uphold justice, Guan Yu refused the hassle. “Dealing with every dispute myself? No thanks.”

Wei later proposed a campus beauty pageant to capitalize on their influence. Guan Yu considered it until Lü Mei overheard and tattled to Qian Yaoyao.

One afternoon, Qian ambushed Wei at the school gates, dragging him from his car by the ear.

“Think I’m not pretty enough?!” she shrieked, pummeling him before storming off. Wei’s ear remained swollen for days.

Cowering later, Wei asked Guan Yu, “How’d Lü Mei find out about the pageant?”

“I told her,” Guan Yu shrugged. “She threatened to cut ties if I proceeded. Survival first.”

“You betrayed me?!” Wei roared. “Qian hasn’t spoken to me since!”

Lü Mei had falsely claimed the pageant’s top beauties would be distributed between them—a lie that killed the plan. Despite Wei’s denials, Qian remained furious.

Groveling to Lü Mei later, Wei begged: “Sister-in-law, help me reconcile with Qian!”

“Only if you convince Guan Yu to wear matching couples’ shirts with me,” she bargained.

At lunch, Wei piled delicacies before Guan Yu. “You look shabby,” he fawned. “Lü Mei’s new outfit would suit you...”

“Trying to make me her fashion doll?” Guan Yu smirked, but agreed to help.

That afternoon, Guan Yu changed shirts before Lü Mei’s admiring gaze. “Talk to Qian,” he said. “Wei’s suffered enough.”

By evening, Qian summoned Wei for reconciliation dinner. “That fool’s whipped,” Guan Yu laughed. “Qian’s his empress now.”

Walking campus in matching shirts with Lü Mei, they drew envious stares—the campus king and queen, perfectly paired.

Chapter 1919: Rescue Call

Dawn on a weekend found Guan Yu groaning at his ringing phone. Zhang Han’s weak voice pleaded: “Uncle…I’m dying…come quick…”

Rushing to Yang Conghan’s villa, he found Zhang Han listless in bed, her pink nightgown accenting youthful curves. The room smelled oddly floral—a cloying, artificial scent.

“Migraine…weak…” she whimpered.

Investigating, Guan Yu spotted fresh scratches in the door lock. “Someone drugged you last night,” he revealed. “Used master keys and knockout incense.”

“What?!” Zhang Han clutched her chest dramatically. “Did a pervert…violate me?!”

“No,” Guan Yu reassured, opening windows. “But they wanted you unconscious. Question is—why leave you here?”

As air circulated, Zhang Han’s color improved. “Feel better already! You’re magic, Uncle!”

But Guan Yu’s frown deepened. Whoever breached this high-security home had resources—and unfinished business.
