Guan Yu continued, “However, many aspects of your martial world closely resemble the period dramas from my homeland. While I can grasp some elements, if you were to visit my homeland directly, you’d likely find everything bewildering and struggle to learn anything.”

“Father, don’t be in such a hurry,” interjected the voice. “Once Guan Yu breaks the seal, the three of us can go together to his homeland. I’m certain it’s a beautiful city—you’ll see.”

“Let’s discuss this another time,” the Demon Lord said dismissively. “For now, let’s drink and eat.”

Guan Yu sighed in relief, hoping the Demon Lord wouldn’t trouble him further. Returning to his room, he found Wang Xiaorong waiting. “It’s late,” he remarked. “Shouldn’t you be asleep?”

“I don’t want to leave,” she murmured, her breath warm. “Don’t you want me to stay?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Yanzao might return soon. Though he’s from your Demon Soul Sect, our relationship must remain secret. If he discovers it, I’ll be in grave danger. That man is cunning—even when using him, tread carefully.”

“Why fret over that?” she pouted. “Are you really sending me away like this? Shouldn’t you at least hold me?” Disappointed, she had imagined Guan Yu as more romantic, but now he seemed as wooden as any ordinary man.

“Very well.” Guan Yu wrapped his arms around her. Wang Xiaorong nestled contentedly against his sturdy chest, warmth seeping into her as if lulling her to sleep.

“So warm... so comforting. I love this feeling,” she murmured blissfully before abruptly changing the subject. “Guan Yu, could I have another bag of your beef jerky?”

The flavor had haunted her. Without another bag tonight, she’d surely lie awake.

“Of course,” Guan Yu replied. “My friend brought these for me to share. Take them all if you like.”

“Just one more bag,” she insisted. “Keep the rest for tomorrow. I’ll come back then, alright?”

“Agreed. But when you return, disguise yourself. Yanzao will be here—we must pretend not to know each other. Understand?”

“I know,” she said solemnly. “The fewer who know of us, the safer you’ll be. I’d never endanger you.”

After she left, Guan Yu sat pondering. The Demon Lord had avoided critical matters today, fixating instead on trivialities. Though he seemed to tacitly accept Guan Yu’s bond with Wang Xiaorong, his true motives remained opaque.

Guan Yu doubted the Demon Lord cared about his affairs. If the Demon Lord planned to strike after Guan Yu collected all Eight-Sided Drum Techniques, he was deluded—once complete, even the Demon Lord would struggle against him.

Strangely, the Demon Lord hadn’t mentioned the techniques at all. Guan Yu shrugged it off. So long as his cultivation remained uninterrupted, little else mattered. As for Wang Xiaorong’s loyalty, time would tell.

Dawn found Guan Yu sleepless. Yanzao returned as sunlight crept in.

“Daybreak,” Yanzao announced. “Time to depart.”

“Wait,” Guan Yu countered. “A friend is joining us—they’ll aid our desert mission.”

“A friend? Who?” Yanzao narrowed his eyes. “Xiao Zhi?”

“No. Someone I met in the martial world. They know the desert well. An extra ally means greater safety.”

“Outsiders complicate things,” Yanzao snapped. “This is Yunqing Sect’s mission. We don’t need interlopers.”

Guan Yu’s tone hardened. “I’m bringing them regardless. If you object, return to the sect. I’ll complete this alone.”

Yanzao’s face darkened. Before he could retort, the door opened.

A stunning young woman stood framed in sunlight. Yanzao gaped, transfixed. Guan Yu barely recognized Wang Xiaorong—her features now elegantly sharpened, crimson attire radiating vitality.

“May I enter?” she asked sweetly. “I heard raised voices...”

Yanzao recovered swiftly, puffing his chest. “I’m Senior Brother Yanzao of the Yunqing Sect, Guan Yu’s superior. And you are...?”

“Mei Mei, Guan Yu’s fiancée.”

**Chapter 3,651: The Fox Reveals Its Tail**

Yanzao’s smile froze. Guan Yu watched in dark amusement as the senior brother’s facade cracked, revealing the lecher beneath his pious exterior. Wang Xiaorong’s transformation had exposed the hypocrite’s true nature—a wolf in saint’s clothing.
