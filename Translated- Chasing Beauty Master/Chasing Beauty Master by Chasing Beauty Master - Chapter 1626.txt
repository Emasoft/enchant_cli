The girl nodded and said, “I understand your meaning now. My apologies, I thought you were trying to mock me. I never imagined there truly was such a matter. Your fiancée wishes to introduce me to a man, is that it? So that’s why your fiancée urged me to stay?”

“Exactly, exactly. You’re quite clever to grasp it so quickly. As long as you don’t take offense, all is well. Hehehe.” Guan Yu said with a laugh, relieved she hadn’t misunderstood.

The girl looked solemnly at Guan Yu and asked, “Your fiancée thinks highly of me, yet you keep urging us to leave. Is it that you don’t approve of me? Or do you feel I’m unworthy of your brother?”

Guan Yu froze, utterly unprepared for such a question. At a loss, he turned to glance at Wang Xiaorong.

Wang Xiaorong met his gaze, thinking bitterly, *How could Guan Yu, looking as he does now, attract a young girl’s affection? Impossible! Unless she’s blind!*

Guan Yu cleared his throat. “It’s not that I don’t approve…” He stole a glance at Wang Xiaorong and corrected himself, “Well, perhaps I don’t approve. But that’s not quite right either…”

Once a silver-tongued scholar, Guan Yu now found himself tongue-tied by a mere girl’s words.

“He’s already taken a liking to you,” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “Didn’t you notice me pinching him during your performance earlier? That’s when he decided he approved of you.”

“My thoughts aren’t so complicated,” Guan Yu hurriedly explained, fearing Wang Xiaorong’s displeasure. “I simply want you to leave before reinforcements arrive. Once they come, escape will be difficult. Let’s not delay further.”

The girl appeared unperturbed. She and her grandfather knew martial arts—unless overwhelmed by numbers, fleeing wouldn’t be hard. Yet she longed to stay and witness the capabilities of this man who boasted of annihilating Imperial Guards and defying the City Lord.

“Grandfather,” she said shrewdly, “how can we abandon our benefactor after he saved us?” Knowing her grandfather’s code of honor, this single sentence ensured their stay.

The old man nodded. “You’re right. Sir, we’re grateful for your aid, but let us face the consequences. We won’t burden you further.”

“Since this trouble began with me, I’ll see it through,” Guan Yu stated calmly. “As the saying goes, ‘Help others to the end.’ I recognize your honor, Elder—I share it.”

“Take your grandfather and leave,” Guan Yu urged, now joined by Wang Xiaorong’s silent agreement. Wang Xiaorong’s unease grew—the girl’s lingering glances at Guan Yu threatened dangerous possibilities.

Meanwhile, Young Master Zhang stormed through the City Lord’s residence, his swollen face a grotesque mask. Never before humiliated, not even in the Second Prince’s presence, he assembled sixty soldiers. “Bring the whoreson to me!” he screamed, spittle flying. “I’ll have him flayed alive!”

By the time his mob returned, spectators lined the streets. Guan Yu stood calmly with Wang Xiaorong and the two performers as soldiers surrounded them.

“Mad dog returns with its tail between its legs?” Guan Yu mocked, surveying the troops. “You think these curs can touch me? Leave now, and spare yourself greater shame.”

“You dare!” Zhang shrieked, fan trembling in his hand. “My father never struck me! You’ll pay for this!”

At his command, soldiers rushed forward—only to be sent flying by Guan Yu’s Luohun Blade. Battle qi arced through the air as Guan Yu moved like a tempest, striking with controlled precision. Within moments, dozens lay groaning.

Wang Xiaorong nibbled peaches, thoroughly entertained. The girl stared wide-eyed at Guan Yu’s back—this mountain of a man shielding them from calamity.

“I warned you,” Guan Yu said, hauling Zhang up by the collar. “Your father’s indulgence ends here. Bully others again, and I’ll snap your neck. Remember—I’ll beat you senseless every time we meet.”

“Kill me then!” Zhang spat defiantly. “The City Lord and Second Prince will hunt you down!”

Guan Yu slammed him to the ground, fist pounding his stomach. “Test me again,” he growled, “and see how quickly your bravado fails.”

Around them, the crowd murmured in awe. The old performer patted his granddaughter’s shoulder—their protector’s prowess exceeded all boasting. As Zhang whimpered in the dirt, Guan Yu stood tall, the very image of unyielding justice.
