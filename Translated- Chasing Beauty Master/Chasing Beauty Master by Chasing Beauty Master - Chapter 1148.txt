Jia Bo, fuming with rage, gripped his pistol in one hand and a baseball bat snatched from the ground in the other, swinging wildly at the assailants.

The mere presence of his firearm cowed the attackers into submission. Chaos erupted as Yu Bang's four men pummeled over twenty thugs into writhing heaps on the floor, none daring to fight back.

Five minutes later, a breathless Jia Bo barked, "Stop! Drag their leader here!"

Two Yu Bang enforcers, drenched in sweat from their exertions, hauled forward a man swollen-faced like a battered hog. Perched on a barstool, Jia Bo glared down at the captive. "Answer truthfully," he warned, tapping the bat against his palm, "or you'll taste this again."

The bloodied man nodded groggily, a tooth dislodging from his mouth as he croaked, "My name... A-Xiao..." His tearful gaze followed the fallen molar to the floor.

Jia Bo felt no pity. Like his mentor Guan Yu, he knew mercy toward enemies invited cruelty upon oneself. Had he not brandished the gun earlier, their positions might be reversed.

"Call your boss," Jia Bo commanded coldly. "Tell him to bring five million for damages and bail money." The demand was exorbitant – mere hundreds of thousands could repair the bar – but thrift held no place in vengeance.

Chapter 2937: Summon Your Boss

A-Xiao trembled. His employer had promised this would be simple vandalism – smash the unguarded bar, claim Poison Widow's name, and depart. Now captured and extorted, he faced an impossible choice: contacting Ma Tong would invite abandonment, yet refusal meant more beating.

When hesitation lingered, Jia Bo's bat jabbed at his throat. "Waiting for dinner invitations? Make the call!"

Forced to improvise, A-Xiao dialed the casino manager Wen Lanqi. "W-we failed... They want five million..."

Chapter 2938: Passing the Buck

Wen contacted Ma Tong, who feigned prescient calm. "Guan Yu's forces were always formidable. Let Poison Widow handle this – we supplied manpower under her banner."

Relaying this to Poison Widow brought scathing rebuke: "Twenty men overpowered by five? Your recruits are nursery-school weaklings!"

Wen retorted, "They had guns! Your grand plans didn't include arming us, did they?"

The stalemate broke when Poison Widow threatened exposure: "Your men will crack under torture. When they name Ma Tong, Guan Yu's wrath follows."

Chapter 2939: Broken Alliances

Poison Widow and co-conspirator Bill Lin reluctantly negotiated a compromise – each contributing half the ransom to preserve their fragile alliance with Ma Tong.

Back at the casino, Wen confronted Ma Tong's fury: "That venomous hag betrays our agreement!"

Ma Tong's curses echoed through the hall. Five million loomed as blood money – pay to avoid Guan Yu's retaliation, or risk annihilation. As Poison Widow arrived with partial funds, the crime lord's dilemma deepened: swallow the loss or face war on two fronts.

The standoff continued, each faction's moves calculated like chess pieces in a lethal game, where silver and lead held equal currency.
