Guan Yu thought to himself that now was not the time to confront the old man. After all, this place was revered by the entire village. If he clashed with the old man now, the whole village would likely turn against him and implicate his aunt's family.

All he could do now was endure. "Elder," he said, "why don't I take you to their house? They can vouch that I'm not a villain."

"Don't even think about it!" The old man barked sharply. "If you mean harm to the Wen family, wouldn't I become your accomplice by leading you there? Leave now before I strike, or don't blame me for what happens next!"

The old man's tone toward Guan Yu lacked the courtesy he'd shown Jin Ciyu Lang earlier. Clearly, Guan Yu possessed no trace of inner qi despite claiming the Wen family had invited him to slay monsters. To the old man, someone who'd be lucky to escape being monster fodder couldn't possibly hunt beasts. His skepticism was palpable.

Guan Yu hadn't expected his earlier act with Jin Ciyu Lang to go unappreciated. "Elder, I truly am the Wen family's guest. Shouldn't you treat guests better than enemies? Do I look like a villain?" Guan Yu gestured to his refined appearance, confident his demeanor belied any malice.

"Appearances deceive!" The old man sneered. "Even if you're kin to the Wens, skulking here at night reeks of ill intent. That I haven't struck yet is only out of respect for them. Do you want me to break your legs? You, handling monsters? Preposterous!"

Guan Yu's irritation grew at the old man's contempt. Though anger simmered, provoking a fight would endanger the Wen family. "Elder," he said coolly, "you're the village chief, aren't you? As leader, must you view all outsiders as threats? Are we all villains to you?"

"Exactly! Outsiders only bring harm. Why else would they visit our remote village? We neither need nor want their interference!"

The unreasonable old man held all the power here. Arguing on his turf was folly. Worse, his arrogance blinded him—monsters already preyed on villagers, yet he rejected aid. Guan Yu sensed the chief's cultivation was weak, and the village clearly lacked strong defenders given the unchecked monster threat.

Even if Guan Yu abandoned them, he couldn't let the Wens suffer. "Very well, Elder. Since you insist, I'll leave. But my girlfriend remains with the Wens. Summon her, and we'll depart immediately."

The chief stiffened upon hearing another outsider. "Wait here." He produced a beast horn and blew a deep, resonant note that stirred the village awake.

Lin Qiaoqiao jolted upright in bed, finding Guan Yu gone. Dressing hastily, she rushed out to find her aunt and uncle-in-law awake while little Zhu still slept.

"Where's Guan Yu?"

"Wasn't he inside?" her aunt asked.

Her uncle-in-law paled. "That's the emergency signal! Did Guan Yu cause trouble?"

"We must find him!" Lin Qiaoqiao urged. They hurried toward the gathering crowd at the village entrance—a spectacle Guan Yu found ironically efficient compared to city chaos.

Villagers swarmed under the chief's stern gaze. When Lin Qiaoqiao spotted Guan Yu and ran over, the chief glared. "Are you together?"

"What if we are?" she shot back, unimpressed.

Third Elder Brother Wen and his wife emerged, calling urgently, "Guan Yu! Qiaoqiao! Come here!"

The chief blocked their path with his staff. "Wen Laoer! You've violated village law bringing outsiders here!"

"Please, Chief!" The uncle-in-law pleaded. "With monsters plaguing us, my wife fetched relatives to help! They're family!"

"We handle our own affairs!" the chief roared. "I'll punish your household!"

The aunt protested, "Since when can't relatives visit?"

"Six months ago, when I forbade outsiders! Or have you ignored my decree?"

Indeed, since monsters appeared, the chief had isolated the village. "But Guan Yu came to help!" the aunt argued.

"Defiance!" The chief's face purpled. "You'll face judgment before the Sacred Tree!"

Lin Qiaoqiao scoffed, "Bullying with petty power! We'll leave, but harming innocents? You're the villain here!"

"Impudent wench!" The chief turned to the crowd. "She insults our Sacred Tree! Punish her!"

Chants of "Punish!" erupted. Guan Yu realized these brainwashed villagers blindly obeyed. Time to act.

"Chief," Guan Yu declared coldly, "your theatrics don't frighten me. You're the true menace here. We'll take the Wens and leave this godforsaken hole."

The uncle-in-law tugged his sleeve in warning, but Guan Yu reassured, "Trust me. I'll give you a better life elsewhere."

Lin Qiaoqiao added, "Even in cities of millions, none dare cross Guan Yu!"

The aunt, recalling tales of Guan Yu's wealth, silenced her husband. City life beckoned—a world beyond this backwater.

As Guan Yu demanded passage, the chief raised his staff. "Insolent pup! I'll teach you respect!"

Before he could strike, a bestial roar shook the night. Panicked villagers scattered as a hulking black figure lunged at Guan Yu. Shoving Lin Qiaoqiao to safety, Guan Yu drew a flying dagger to parry claws that sparked against steel, the impact knocking both combatants back.

The chief gaped—Guan Yu's speed defied his qi-less appearance. The monster, now visible, resembled a grotesque hybrid: shaggy torso, scaled lower body, crocodilian maw with boar nostrils, and a lashing tail. Exactly the beast from the aunt's stories—minus wings.

"Can't speak, huh?" Guan Yu taunted the snarling creature. "Squealing like a sow suits you."

Enraged, the monster charged again. Guan Yu snapped his fingers. A crimson arc split the darkness as Jin Ciyu Lang descended, severing a clawed hand. Green blood oozed as the beast howled.

"Damn," Jin Ciyu Lang muttered, sheathing his blade. "Three hundred pounds of mutated rage. Qi deviation?"

The battle had just begun.
