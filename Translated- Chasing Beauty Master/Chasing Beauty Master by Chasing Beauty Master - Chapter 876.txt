“Forget it then. Staying in the county town is better—at least I can come back when I miss home. Oh... Oh, Handsome Brother, you touched me.” Shuangshuang exclaimed in surprise.

How could they avoid contact? The two were already pressed tightly together. Shuangshuang wore only a loose yellow Donald Duck nightgown, her alluring figure on full display. Guan Yu’s gaze hadn’t left her chest since they began speaking—those “bunnies” of hers were surprisingly ample for her age. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu stealthily reached out to squeeze one. The springy softness felt marvelous.

“No, I didn’t,” Guan Yu denied, “I was just adjusting my position.” He knew Meimei on the bed below wasn’t asleep yet and didn’t want to leave a bad impression.

“You did touch me! You grabbed my... my chest!” Shuangshuang insisted. Guan Yu broke into a cold sweat, shocked by her bluntness. With someone else present, this embarrassment now hung exposed.

“Oh, that wasn’t intentional. This space is too cramped—any movement brushes against you. Here, let me demonstrate.” Guan Yu’s hand “accidentally” fondled her again.

“Ah!” A jolt like electric current raced through Shuangshuang’s body, drawing a breathy whimper. Her delicate voice—already honeyed—now dripped with irresistible allure.

Guan Yu savored the moment before defending himself: “See? Mere movement causes contact.”

“Maybe... But stop squirming! Or I’ll return to bed,” Shuangshuang warned. Though smitten, her strict upbringing kept her reserved. Crowding together like this already pushed her limits.

Was this Guan Yu’s charm? Perhaps wealth alone magnetized women.

“Fine, I’ll stay still,” Guan Yu conceded.

“Handsome Brother,” Shuangshuang whispered, “you mentioned many women throwing themselves at you. Does being pursued by countless admirers feel wonderful? Are rare heartthrobs like you truly uncommon?”

“Not really. Their chasing means little—compatibility matters. Like you—I fancy you too.” Guan Yu’s reply came smoothly.

Through the thin partition wall, muffled moans seeped from the aunt and uncle’s room. Guan Yu marveled at the uncle’s vigor—the aunt’s passionate cries soon escalated to gasped pleas of “Faster!” and “It’s coming!”

**Chapter 2242: Whispered Conversations**

On the bed below, Meimei burned with shame. *Couldn’t my parents control themselves with guests here?* She buried her flaming face in blankets.

Guan Yu’s hand traced circles on Shuangshuang’s thigh. At his touch, she shuddered as if electrocuted. “Mmm...” Her feverish whimper sent his pulse racing.

This time, Shuangshuang didn’t protest but cooed: “So naughty, Handsome Brother...”

“I’m teaching you resilience—for your own good,” Guan Yu argued shamelessly.

“Oh? Truly?”

“Absolutely.” His wandering hand stoked her rising temperature. “Don’t... you’re terrible...” Her breathy protests clashed with the elderly couple’s symphony, torturing Meimei’s frayed nerves.

“If you keep this up, I’ll leave!” Shuangshuang threatened without moving.

“Aren’t we engaged? What’s wrong with some touching?” Guan Yu’s boldness grew, emboldened by Meimei’s feigned sleep. His roaming hands drew breathy gasps until Shuangshuang finally pulled away.

“I’m leaving!” Yet hesitation rooted her in place—how could she abandon him to this cold kang bed?

“Fine... I’ll stay a bit longer. But no more touching!”

***

“This *is* for your benefit. Every first experience matters.”

“You’re tricking me like a child!” Shuangshuang accused.

“Remember when you kissed me in the car? Consider this payback.”

She clapped a hand over his mouth, glancing fearfully at Meimei. “Don’t mention that! If Sister hears...”

“Then let me touch lightly... but behave!” Her whisper tickled his ear.

Reading her anxiety, Guan Yu grinned. “Our secret stays safe—if you cooperate.”

Shuangshuang locked him in an embrace to restrict movement. “Happy now?”

Cramped space foiled his plans until inspiration struck: “Ever heard of bone-reading divination?”

“Vaguely. Why?”

“I’m skilled in it,” Guan Yu declared, leveraging girls’ curiosity. “Shall I read your fortune?”

“Yes! Do it!” Excitement overrode caution.

On the bed, Meimei’s ears perked up. She emerged slightly from covers, unnoticed by Guan Yu’s sharp hearing.

Under guise of divination, Guan Yu’s “diagnostic” groping soon overwhelmed Shuangshuang. Their lips met passionately until she broke away, panting: “Enough! You... predator!”

Meimei wondered why the “reading” took so long. As she peeked, Shuangshuang’s breathless scolding confirmed her suspicions: “Stop! You... philanderer!”

***

“How is this my fault? You’re the one who—” Guan Yu’s retort died under Shuangshuang’s desperate kiss.

“Never speak of that again,” she hissed.

Post-climax practicality prevailed—with Meimei present and thin walls, further escalation proved impossible.

“That wasn’t bone-reading—just groping!” Shuangshuang accused.

“Didn’t you enjoy it?” Guan Yu smirked.

“Well? What’s my fortune?”

“What do you seek? Love or wealth?”

“You call this bone-reading? You’re just fondling me! Treating me like a fool!” Shuangshuang fumed.

“Wasn’t it pleasant?” Guan Yu teased.

“Enough! Tell my fortune!”

“Love, obviously,” she whispered, shielding her chest.

“Love requires... deeper analysis.” Guan Yu’s leer promised mischief.

“Liar! I’m done with you!”

Modern girls proved frustratingly sharp. “Very well—your loss.”

Curiosity triumphed. “Fine... one last try. But be accurate!”

***

As Guan Yu’s hands roamed freely, the room’s temperature seemed to spike. Meimei writhed silently until Shuangshuang’s gasped “No more... you beast!” broke the spell.

“Finished?” Shuangshuang panted.

“Indeed. Your marital future shines—a doting husband, lifelong bliss.”

“Will he be named Guan Yu? A dashing tycoon from City A?”

“Specifics require... further examination.”

“Cheat!” She tried rising but faltered, weakly pounding his chest. “Jerk...”

“Too weak to move? I’ll bunk below and read Meimei’s fortune instead.”

Meimei’s stifled gasp betrayed her. Shuangshuang pounced between them: “No! Stay away from Sister!”

Guan Yu feigned innocence until Meimei’s whisper came: “Do mine...”

“She’s baiting you!” Shuangshuang warned.

“What harm in trying?” Meimei slipped into Guan Yu’s bedding. “Proceed.”

**Chapter 2244: No Regrets**

As Guan Yu approached, Meimei tensed but didn’t resist. Shuangshuang vaulted between them: “Stop! Lecher!”

“Fine. Let’s sleep.” Guan Yu yawned theatrically. “Tomorrow’s wedding... wonder how marriage life treats brides?”

Meimei turned, murmuring: “Wait... read mine.”

“As you wish.” Triumph gleamed in his eyes.

“He’s tricking you!” Shuangshuang pleaded.

“What’s there to lose?” Meimei crossed to Guan Yu’s bed, whispering: “Begin.”
