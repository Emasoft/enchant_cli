However, immediately after speaking, he felt a pang of regret.

What's happening to me? Mo Ling sighed inwardly.

Zhang Yi's expression instantly darkened, her gaze toward Guan Yu turning distinctly hostile.

The man in question remained blissfully unaware that he'd attracted another enemy—or more accurately, another grudge—as he currently reveled in the soft curves of the thorny rose pressed against him.

“Coming to seduce me again? Prepared to offer yourself this time?” Guan Yu gazed at the beauty before him, a faint smile playing on his lips.

“If surrendering my body could kill you, I wouldn’t hesitate.” Chu Hong replied with a cold smile, though her expression remained forced.

After a brief surge of anger, she had reverted to her usual seductive persona. The carefully cultivated image she’d maintained for years couldn’t be shattered by Guan Yu’s wandering hands.

Moreover, she’d grown numb to his harassment, long past caring.

“Tsk, lying isn’t becoming of you.” Noting Chu Hong’s sudden composure, Guan Yu felt a flicker of surprise, his estimation of her rising. “I’ve always wondered—how does N City’s famed social butterfly remain chaste? What kind of past creates such duality in you?”

“Does it matter?” Chu Hong sneered.

“It does.” Guan Yu’s tone turned grave. “Breaking free from this act might let you live less… pathetically.”

“I don’t need your hypocritical pity.” Her lips pressed into a thin line.

“Hey, aren’t you supposed to seduce and kill me? Where’s your professionalism? Where’s the endless arsenal of temptations? Dragging me to some room stocked with toys and flight attendant outfits—that’s more my style. Wouldn’t that make killing me easier?” he teased.

“Why pretend between us?” she countered.

“At least maintain appearances. If Zhou Jin notices anything amiss, you’ll suffer first, not me.”

“So you did know.” Her expression stiffened, shock flashing through her eyes.

“Learning your connection wasn’t hard. The real mystery is your grand scheme. Care to enlighten me?”

“Why should I? Remember your place—I’m here to kill you, not let you ruin our plans.” Her laugh held contempt.

“You’ll tell me. Otherwise, this elaborate seduction becomes pointless.” His arms encircled her waist, his breath warm against her ear.

“You’re still breathing. That alone proves failure.” Bitterness laced her words.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Zhou Jin doesn’t know I’ve uncovered your ties, does he? Let me guess—while obeying his orders to seduce me, you’re secretly planning to betray him. Surface-level seduction, hidden collaboration—am I right?”

Chu Hong’s pupils contracted sharply, her misstep causing her to tread on his foot.

Unperturbed, Guan Yu waited calmly for her response.

“Let’s continue this in my room.” He halted their dance, guiding her away with a hand on her perfumed shoulder.

**Chapter 637: Guan Yu, the Master Strategist**

The villa’s hosts naturally wouldn’t vacate a room for romantic pursuits. Thus, barely an hour into the ball, under envious stares, Guan Yu swaggered out with the stunning beauty, driving off without ceremony.

His original purpose—investigating the vice mayor’s ties with Cheng Gui—he entrusted to Xiao Xiong. More pressing matters demanded attention.

Contrary to assumptions of a countryside tryst, Guan Yu brought Chu Hong directly to Xiao Xiong’s secured compound.

Amidst heightened security, the villa stood fortified against Cheng Gui’s potential ambushes. Confident in these defenses, Guan Yu led her inside without concern.

In the master bedroom, Guan Yu poured two glasses of red wine, settling comfortably on the sofa to sip his drink, seemingly forgetting their purpose.

Chu Hong remained standing, mind racing through Guan Yu’s earlier deductions. His words had laid her psyche bare, as though she stood naked before his scrutiny.

Finally, she broke the silence. “When did you discover this?”

“I didn’t. Merely speculated.”

“Speculated?”

“Your ties to Zhou Jin came from Qian Tong.” In truth, his异能 (special ability) revealed it, but invoking the deceased carried more credibility. “After that, I monitored you. Unexpected that you’d approach me first.”

He sipped his wine. “You sought to seduce, I sought intel—mutual exploitation. But I found your dual nature: wanton exterior, wounded soul. Your inner turmoil that day must have alerted Zhou Jin, breeding distrust. Tonight proves that rift widened. After the casino incident, assassins failed, costing you a key player. Realizing N City’s defenses, Zhou Jin lured me to L City through Cheng Gui. But he didn’t anticipate your defection. Now you seek alliance over execution. Correct?”

**Chapter 638: Is This Enough?**

Though gifted with mind-reading abilities, Guan Yu lacked discernment of truth. While sensing Chu Hong’s thoughts, he remained cautious of deception.

“How shall I prove myself?” she countered.

“Remove Cheng Gui from L City.”

Her eyes flashed. “Two birds with one stone. Masterful strategy.”

“Merely demonstrating loyalty,” Guan Yu feigned innocence. “Cheng Gui’s fall strengthens Xiao Xiong against Zhou Jin while proving your sincerity.”

“Guan Yu!” she snapped. “I came in good faith. If unwilling, I’ll leave. Must we play these games?”

“Very well. Answer me this: Why did Wan Qianshan plant you in N City?”

“After becoming Taiwan’s underworld godfather, he sought expansion,” she admitted. “Using N and L Cities as footholds through puppets—Zhou Jin and Cheng Gui.”

“Ambitious,” Guan Yu snorted. “Hence their obsession with eliminating me?”

She nodded. “Initially dismissed, you became perceived as a threat. Zhou Jin tolerates no risks to his decade-long schemes.”

“They still underestimate me. Wan Qianshan’s plans will crumble.”

“Where is he now?”

“Last seen in L City. With operations imminent, he’ll likely remain.”

“After settling Cheng Gui, I’ll ensure he never leaves.” Murderous intent radiated from Guan Yu, chilling the room.

“When do they strike?”

“After your death or Cheng Gui’s takeover. They’ll decapitate N City’s factions during chaos.”

“The old masters’ foundations can’t be shaken!”

“They’ve planted moles,” Chu Hong revealed. “With inside help, even the elders’ heirs will fall, destabilizing everything.”

*Crack.*

The wineglass shattered in Guan Yu’s grip, blood mingling with crimson droplets.

“Who?” The question dripped lethal calm.

“Only Zhou Jin knows. His most trusted spies.”

Ignoring his bleeding hand, Guan Yu dialed Feng Xin, urgently relaying warnings about moles and assassination plots. His palpable concern even moved Chu Hong, stirring unexpected envy.

Hanging up, Guan Yu regarded her coolly. “You may leave.”

“Guan Yu!” She surged upright, furious. “I’ve laid myself bare! Don’t discard me now!”

“Words prove nothing. Once your intel’s verified, we’ll discuss partnership.”

Trembling with rage, Chu Hong felt crushing defeat. Despite her concessions, he remained unmoved.
