At this moment, the crowd parted to make way for a middle-aged man. Mayor Wang strode directly to Li Gui's side, sighed helplessly, then looked up at Lin Zhonggeng and clasped his hands in a slight bow.

"Today's events demand justice. The Li family's heinous acts cannot be tolerated. By our town's customs, all male members of the Li household should be burned at the stake. Does anyone object to this punishment?"

Though Mayor Wang's words carried deference to Lin Zhonggeng, his youthful appearance—no more than thirty—marked him as a junior in lineage.

Lin Zhonggeng nodded approvingly. "Town affairs ultimately rest with the mayor. We merely advise. I find his judgment fitting for the Li family. What say the people?"

Nearly the entire town had gathered, along with many outsiders. Maintaining the town's dignity before these guests demanded unwavering justice.

"Burn them! Burn them!"

The crowd roared in unison, voicing no dissent against the mayor's decree.

Guanyu found such archaic brutality jarring. "Must we inflict such torment? A swift beheading would be more merciful than burning souls in agony."

Lin Zhonggeng explained gravely, "Our town's laws are absolute. Fire execution serves as the severest punishment, ensuring the guilty taste utmost suffering for their transgressions."

A chill ran down Guanyu's spine. This feudal society's cruelty in devising tortures appalled him.

"Must we torment the condemned? If death is inevitable, let it be swift." Guanyu pleaded for mercy, earning Mayor Wang's approval.

The mayor proposed, "Let the people decide the Li family's fate by vote—whether by fire or blade."

As night fell, news arrived: Li Gui had escaped during transfer, aided by the obese brawler from the tournament—one of the Ten Villains.

Guanyu volunteered to track them. With Lin Qiaoqiao and Jay, he combed the streets until reaching the abandoned Li compound.

Pushing open the creaking gate, darkness enveloped them. Qiaoqiao clung to Guanyu as they ventured inside. A pair of glowing green eyes in the corner startled her—merely a cat, yet fear gripped her heart.

The hunt continued through shadowed halls, every creak magnified in the oppressive silence. Though Qiaoqiao trembled, Guanyu's resolve never wavered. Justice would be served, but mercy would temper tradition's harsh hand.
