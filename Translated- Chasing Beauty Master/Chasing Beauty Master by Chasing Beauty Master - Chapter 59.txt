“I didn’t… Why would I ask him to fix a valve for no reason?” Mo Ling pursed her lips, tilting her head challengingly as she glared at Guan Yu.

“You…” Guan Yu’s eyes bulged with rage, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles cracked. If she weren’t a woman, he’d have smashed her face in right then.

This was a setup—a premeditated trap, luring him step by step into their snare. Guan Yu took a deep breath, nodded slowly, and stared coldly at Mo Ling.

“You shameless pervert! Peeping on teachers in the bathroom? Why don’t you go home and watch your mom instead? Does your mom—”

“How dare you speak like that? Are you even a teacher?” Guan Yu suddenly turned, his eyes flashing with icy fury as he spat each word through gritted teeth.

“What’s being a teacher got to do with it? Should I strip for you? You’re the shameless one, scared of being called out?” The middle-aged woman shrieked, pounding her fists against Guan Yu’s shoulders.

Teachers from nearby dorm rooms began pouring into the hallway, crowding around and chattering loudly.

“You filthy scoundrel! A流氓 like you shouldn’t even be in college—straight to the police! Execute him!”

“I said it’s a misunderstanding!” Guan Yu inhaled sharply, suppressing his anger as he defended himself calmly.

*Slap!* A sharp crack echoed as a forceful strike landed on Guan Yu’s cheek. Stunned, he slowly turned to face the middle-aged teacher in her forties.

“Are you fucking insane? Didn’t I make myself clear? It was a mistake—I’ll apologize! Is this really necessary?” Guan Yu growled, barely containing his fury.

As the slap rang out, Liu Shilei happened to ascend the stairs, groceries in hand. She froze, startled by the crowd.

“So what if I hit you? You disgusting pervert—I’ll beat you to death today!” The middle-aged woman, now fully unhinged, grabbed Guan Yu’s collar and raised her hand again.

Before her swing landed, Liu Shilei seized her wrist.

“Did you hit him?” Liu Shilei set down her bags, her face icy as she glared at the teacher.

“Yes, I did! Let go, Miss Liu—this shameless—”

*Slap!* Without warning, Liu Shilei struck back, leaving the woman gaping in shock, her hand pressed to her reddening cheek.

“Watch your mouth! Explain yourself—who’s the pervert? How dare you lay hands on my younger brother! Try hitting him again—who do you think you’re bullying?” Liu Shilei advanced fiercely, jabbing a finger at the woman’s nose as she fired off questions like a machine gun, ready to fight for Guan Yu.

“Liu Shilei! What are you doing? He peeped on us in the bathroom! So what if he’s your brother? Does that make it okay?” The teacher retreated fearfully, muttering defiance.

Liu Shilei frowned, turning suspiciously to Guan Yu. “Is that true?”

“Yes…” Guan Yu licked his lips, meeting Mo Ling’s gaze with unsettling calm.

Mo Ling’s heart clenched under his cold, detached stare. She stepped back nervously, wringing her hands. This had gone too far—she’d only meant to teach him a lesson, not…

“Shilei-jie, stop… It’s my fault.” Guan Yu sighed, tugging Liu Shilei’s arm gently.

“What did you say?” Liu Shilei demanded, her eyes blazing as she stared him down.

“What happened? Did you really peek?”

“I…” Guan Yu hesitated, then nodded. “Yes… I saw.”

“It wasn’t intentional!”

“Not intentional? You climbed the window, got caught, then tried to flee? Liu Shilei—you heard him! Your brother’s a pervert! This isn’t over—we’re reporting him to the dean! He’ll be expelled!”

Liu Shilei breathed heavily, her eyes burning with anger. “Aren’t you going to explain?”

“Explain what…” Guan Yu said flatly, glancing at Mo Ling. “I didn’t mean to spy. Believe it or not—I won’t justify myself. No need for theatrics. I’ll drop out myself.” He shook off Liu Shilei’s grip and stormed downstairs.

**Chapter 142: Utterly Infuriating**

“Wait…” Mo Ling reached out helplessly, then let her arm fall.

Guan Yu’s icy, desolate gaze had pierced her heart. This wasn’t what she’d wanted—she’d only meant to humble him. Seeing Liu Shilei’s anguish deepened her regret.

“Teacher Jiang, I’ll investigate this. If my brother’s truly at fault, I’ll bring him to apologize personally,” Liu Shilei said coldly before chasing after Guan Yu.

The onlookers dispersed silently under her glare. Mo Ling hesitated, nails digging into her palms, but couldn’t bring herself to follow.

Guan Yu marched out of the dorm, fists clenched. Spotting a sapling, he sprinted and punched—*crack!*—snapping it mid-trunk. Blood dripped from his shredded knuckles, but he felt nothing.

*This is beyond unjust.* Liu Shilei’s disappointed eyes haunted him.

Explanation? Futile—Mo Ling’s trap was airtight. He’d leave this damned place.

**Chapter 143: It’s This Demon**

Liu Shilei watched Guan Yu’s retreating figure, conflicted. He wasn’t that kind of man—so why?

The snapped tree deepened her sigh.

Meanwhile, dorm supervisor Hao Ge—a pockmarked, lanky man in his twenties—held court with delinquent upperclassmen.

“Newbies this year are wilder than you lot! Smoking, gambling, drinking—breaking every rule! Help me crack down tonight.”

“Sure thing, Hao Ge! We’ll clean house!”

Back in Guan Yu’s dorm, his roommates smoked lazily until Hao Ge kicked the door open.

“Smoking? Think you’re hot shit? Out—now!”

A hallway soon packed with nervous freshmen.

“Who the hell let you play poker here? You asking for a beating?” Hao Ge roared.

As Guan Yu returned, a thug spotted him. “Hey! You—get out here!”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu entered his room.

“Deaf bastard!” The thug barged in—only to be launched across the hall by a flying kick, crashing through a door.

“Who did this?!” Hao Ge stormed over, flanked by lackeys.

“Yell again and I’ll break your jaw,” Guan Yu sneered, stepping out.
