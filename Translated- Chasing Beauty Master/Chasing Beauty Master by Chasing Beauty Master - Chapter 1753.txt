The Scarlet Lotus Sect’s caravan had been traversing the desert for an exceedingly long time—nearly two months. Originally numbering over a hundred members, their ranks had dwindled to fewer than sixty, the rest having perished along the way.

Even so, their mission to locate Miao City remained imperative. Yet without demonic guides to lead them, the search proved arduous. Over these two months, they had nearly scoured the entire desert, only to circle back to this spot, convinced Miao City lay somewhere nearby.

Drawing upon decades of experience, Elder Zhao decided to establish a temporary encampment here. Given that this was the sole path through the vicinity, any travelers would inevitably pass by—a strategic position allowing the Scarlet Lotus Sect to intercept potential adversaries while seeking solutions to their predicament.

“To think this young maiden is the Sect Master of the Heterodox Creed—truly astonishing,” Elder Zhao remarked, stepping forward. “I’ve heard tales of your sect’s notorious exploits in these deserts. Your reputation here is... less than savory, I must say.”

All knew of the Heterodox Creed’s infamy in the desert—a sect akin to the Demon Soul Sect, whose disciples pillaged and slaughtered without remorse, earning them widespread disdain.

That their notoriety had reached even the distant Scarlet Lotus Sect, shrouded in obscurity, spoke volumes. Whether this reflected the Creed’s unparalleled vileness or Elder Zhao’s far-reaching knowledge remained debatable.

To outsiders, the Heterodox Creed appeared irredeemably wicked. Yet survival in the desert’s harsh law of the jungle demanded such ruthlessness. To thrive here, one had to seize and conquer—or perish.

Every individual and sect chose their path. Had the Heterodox Creed refrained from plunder, they could never have rooted themselves in these sands.

“Why the surprise?” Guanyu said nonchalantly. “Surely you’ve discerned she’s a demonic cultivator. Her youthful appearance belies centuries of cultivation—a monster cloaked in girlish guise.”

“Guanyu! How dare you call me a monster? You’re clearly doing this on purpose!” Xiaomei protested indignantly. Had such words come from another, she might have retaliated viciously. But from Guanyu, she could only sulk—his remark had struck a nerve.

Guanyu swiftly clarified, “I merely state the obvious. As the Heterodox Creed’s leader, any discerning eye would recognize your true nature. Did you truly think to deceive an elder of such venerable experience?”

Xiaomei conceded the point. This elder had undoubtedly seen through her demonic essence. By addressing it openly, Guanyu might have disarmed suspicion—perhaps even garnered goodwill.

“You youths are... intriguing,” Elder Zhao remarked impassively, offering no further comment.

Earlier, the elder had discreetly assessed their cultivation levels. While Xiaomei’s demonic aura proved elusive, the old man beside her remained equally inscrutable. Could he too be a demonic cultivator?

Elder Zhao pondered whether to broach the subject. Collaborating with demonic allies might prove advantageous, though orthodox sects typically shunned such alliances.

A demonic cultivator assuming elderly form suggested mediocre cultivation—true masters maintained youthful visages through spiritual prowess.

“What brings you here?” Elder Zhao pressed. “For a Sect Master to lead personally—you seek Miao City, do you not?”

Guanyu knew deception was futile. With their leader present, their purpose was transparent: to locate Miao City using demonic methods. Instead of answering, he countered, “The Scarlet Lotus Sect’s renown precedes you. Such a large contingent must likewise pursue Miao City. Do you not have demonic guides? Perhaps we could... collaborate.”

“An amusing notion,” Elder Zhao chuckled coldly. “We are an orthodox sect—bastions of righteousness. How could we consort with demonic elements? Though we indeed seek Miao City, two months in these wastes have yielded no concrete leads.”

The elder’s startling candor continued: “I understand Miao City belongs to the demonic realm. Those tainted by demonic energy can sense its presence. Yet we’ve reached this point through experience alone.”

Guanyu marveled inwardly. To navigate this far without demonic guidance spoke either of extraordinary skill or secret techniques. The Scarlet Lotus Sect’s commitment was undeniable—two months in this hellscape testified to their desperation.

“Your prowess is commendable,” Guanyu acknowledged. “As paragons of virtue, surely you’ll not impede us? Grant us passage, and we’ll trouble you no further.”

“Why the haste?” Elder Zhao’s tone shifted abruptly. “Our meeting is fortuitous. Should we not confer?”

Guanyu discerned the ploy—they sought Xiaomei’s aid in locating Miao City. An alliance he would never permit.

**Chapter 4586: Clarifications**

“Our paths diverge,” Guanyu declared. “You claim righteousness while branding us desert fiends. We’ve no grounds for fellowship. Either grant passage or we’ll detour.”

Critical now was concealing Miao City’s proximity. Without demonic trackers, the Scarlet Lotus Sect remained lost. Perhaps by tomorrow they’d abandon this position.

Cooperation was impossible. Two months in the desert had reduced these orthodox cultivators to begging help from their sworn enemies—a testament to their desperation.

“We block no roads,” Elder Zhao feigned innocence. “This flat terrain simply suits encampment. We expected no travelers in these barren wastes.”

The lie hung palpable. They’d positioned themselves here precisely to intercept passersby—a final gambit after exhausting all options. With days dwindling, this chance encounter offered their last hope.

“Though your sect’s reputation stinks,” Elder Zhao conceded, “we’ve no quarrel with the Heterodox Creed. In this vast desert, our meeting signifies destiny. Collaboration benefits both.”

Guanyu snorted. “We’ve urgent business. You bar our path while preaching dialogue? Absurd. Let us part ways—permanently.”

As Guanyu’s group departed, a Scarlet Lotus disciple whispered, “Elder, let them go?”

“Would you have us act like bandits?” Elder Zhao chided. “Our sect’s honor remains intact. If they refuse aid, we’ll find another way.”

Retreating to his tent, the elder issued commands: “Send two scouts to track them discreetly. Uncover their movements.”

The logic was sound—following demonic guides might lead to Miao City. Yet in featureless dunes, stealth proved impossible.

Guanyu avoided confrontation, unwilling to reveal their true Cloud Azure Sect identities. Detouring cost mere hours—a small price. As dusk approached, they established camp afar.

The night’s rain had left everyone weary. Though thick clouds blocked the sun, stifling heat persisted.

At dawn, Siqi spotted distant figures—Scarlet Lotus trackers, absurdly conspicuous.

“Rest further,” Guanyu announced. “We’ll depart when refreshed.” Seizing the opportunity, he circled behind the pursuers with Wangjun’s crossbow.

A bolt struck their camel’s skull. As the beast collapsed, Guanyu smirked—let them track on foot now.

By noon, Xiaomei suggested altering course southward. “Miao City nears. This direction feels correct.”

“You lead,” Guanyu agreed. Their camel train outpaced the stranded scout, who soon realized his futility—returning would lose the trail, yet continuing exhausted him.

**Chapter 4587: Spectacle**

“Another group ahead,” Siqi noted through the haze. Approaching revealed not travelers, but combatants—spells flashing amidst blade clashes.

As hostilities paused at their approach, Guanyu recognized one faction: “The High Mountain Sect! How you’ve raced ahead! Encountering more foes?”

The embattled High Mountain cultivators paled—their prior conflict with Guanyu boded ill. The opposing desert tribesmen grew equally anxious, fearing reinforcements.

Guanyu laughed. “The High Mountain Sect—all bark, no bite. Carry on! We’ll observe.”

To the tribesmen’s leader, he explained: “We know these incompetents. Nearly fought them ourselves. How did this skirmish begin?”

The scene epitomized desert law—two factions of mediocre cultivators and swordsmen clashing without honor or purpose. Guanyu resolved to exploit his Heterodox Creed guise, ensuring none recognized his true sect. Let the desert’s chaos unfold—he would watch, and learn, and seize advantage.
