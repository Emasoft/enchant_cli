“Beauty! The department’s flower, the school’s flower! The icy enchantress acknowledged by the entire university, subdued by you just like that? And so docile and obedient. Brother… you’re my lifelong role model. Lift me up, will you? Share some secrets!” Wang Zhen rushed to Guan Yu’s side, gripping his arm fervently as he exclaimed excitedly.

Chapter 315: Beauty Lies in the Lover’s Eyes

Guan Yu hadn’t expected Wen Qing to behave so meekly, boosting his pride so effortlessly. Though inwardly pleased, he maintained an air of nonchalance. “Enough nonsense. Let’s head back…”

“Brother, what’s the point of us setting up this boys’ division?” Tian Hao trailed beside Guan Yu, whispering curiously.

Guan Yu shot them an exasperated glance. “Weren’t you two the ones who wanted to expand our influence on campus? I’m creating legitimate opportunities for you to recruit followers. Still don’t get it?”

Wang Zhen blinked before erupting in joy. “So you’re approving it?”

“Approve what? I’m granting you authority to recruit student council members. But be discerning—no troublemakers or bullies. Understood? Reject anyone who preys on the weak.” Guan Yu’s tone turned serious.

“Got it… but Brother, the students we’re targeting are all slackers failing in every aspect. Is it appropriate to bring them into the council?” Tian Hao hunched his shoulders uneasily.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Do you think I meet any virtue-intellect-physique standards? If I can become council president, why can’t you? Just avoid major scandals. I’ll handle the school.”

“Fantastic!” Wang Zhen rubbed his hands gleefully. At last, he and Tian Hao could make their mark! With the council’s authority, recruiting would be effortless.

“How many can we enlist?”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “As many decent candidates as you find—no upper limit. The more, the better.”

Returning to class with his three brothers, Wang Zhen and Tian Hao—ever the loudspeakers—quickly spread news of Guan Yu’s presidency. Amidst classmates’ whispers, Zhao Jing’er gazed adoringly at Guan Yu. “Wow, Brother! You’re amazing! A freshman becoming student council president!”

Guan Yu chuckled wordlessly.

“Brother… can I join the council too?”

“You want to?” Guan Yu tilted his head. This socially inexperienced girl’s request puzzled him.

“You’ll be so busy now. I… want to stay close. It feels safer.” Zhao Jing’er blinked her luminous eyes softly.

Ah—Guan Yu finally understood. This little shadow simply wanted to cling to him. Smiling indulgently, he conceded, “Fine. You can idle there.”

“Oh! Speaking of which…” Guan Yu recalled Wen Qing’s situation and turned to Zhao Jing’er. “Help me analyze something.”

“What?” She rested her arms on the desk, attentive.

“Well… I met a girl at a bar recently…” Guan Yu summarized the encounter briefly.

“So… after what happened between you, she now wants to be together?” Zhao Jing’er’s cheeks flushed as she whispered.

“Yeah.” Guan Yu rubbed his nose awkwardly.

Zhao Jing’er giggled behind her hand. “Brother, you’re actually shy!”

Guan Yu glared. “Stop teasing. Just tell me—what’s happening here?” While he could usually decipher girls’ intentions, Wen Qing’s sudden advance left him bewildered.

Tilting her head playfully, Zhao Jing’er reasoned, “It’s simple! A superb, handsome, charismatic man like you naturally attracts admirers. Even if she had a boyfriend, he couldn’t compare. After being intimate, her falling for you is only natural!” She nodded decisively, wide-eyed.

Guan Yu reddened under the praise, stammering, “Am I really… that remarkable?” The flattery left him both bashful and inflated.

“Of course! You’re the world’s greatest man—capable, handsome, considerate. Any girl would be lucky to have you!” Zhao Jing’er declared fervently, her face crimson.

Guan Yu coughed nervously, at a loss for words.

Their conversation clearly reached Fu Lili nearby. Zhao Jing’e’s final compliments raised goosebumps across her skin.

“Ugh! Shameless! Has she forgotten her own name?” Fu Lili sneered derisively.

Though surrounding classmates only caught fragments, Zhao Jing’er’s effusive praise was unmistakable. Girls nearby covered smirking mouths.

“Beauty lies in the lover’s eyes. Understandable,” chuckled a bespectacled plump girl behind Fu Lili.

While Guan Yu had made waves recently, none perceived him as the paragon Zhao Jing’er described. Her depiction of him as every woman’s prince charming seemed exaggerated.

“Lover’s eyes? More like duping naive girls!” Fu Lili snorted contemptuously toward Guan Yu.

The class tittered in agreement. Since Zhao Jing’er’s arrival, everyone recognized her childlike innocence—a pure soul untainted by guile.

Chapter 316: The Campus Belle Arrives

Fu Lili’s mockery garnered widespread approval.

Guan Yu merely glanced coldly at her. “Gossiping hag… disgusting.” He turned away, unwilling to engage—better to avoid venomous women unless provoked.

Though Guan Yu ignored the provocation, Zhao Jing’er bristled. Leaning across desks, she retorted, “Fu Lili! Your mockery just proves your poor judgment. You’re utterly unworthy of Brother!” With a triumphant huff, she turned her back.

Amused, Guan Yu whispered, “Why bother? Let her rant.”

“But she’s hateful—mocking what she can’t appreciate!” Zhao Jing’er pouted.

Fu Lili’s face darkened, though fear of Guan Yu kept her from retorting.

“If you’re so charming, why not pursue our faculty’s campus belle, Wen Qing? Conquer her, then boast! Tricking simpletons doesn’t make you Casanova!” Fu Lili’s shrill challenge drew snickers from onlookers.

At that precise moment, Wen Qing herself appeared at the classroom door. A stunned silence fell—as if summoned by the taunt.

Spotting Guan Yu, Wen Qing smiled sweetly and glided toward him. “Darling… I’ve organized all the documents.”

Fu Lili gaped in disbelief. The famously aloof ice queen—every male’s fantasy—just called Guan Yu “husband”? And what of her supposedly perfect match with Xu Wei?

Noticing Zhao Jing’er, Wen Qing hesitated—was this his girlfriend? Before anxiety could take root, Zhao Jing’er rose cheerfully: “Sister-in-law! I’m Zhao Jing’er.” She extended a friendly hand.

“Oh, hello!” Wen Qing’s tension dissolved, accepting the seat Tian Hao provided beside Guan Yu. Being addressed as “sister-in-law” thrilled her—acceptance from his circle!

“Why come so soon?” Guan Yu arched an eyebrow.

“To deliver member lists and event plans.” She laid out documents, shoulders brushing his as she explained council affairs. Zhao Jing’er observed quietly, marveling at Wen Qing’s breathtaking allure—a siren no man could resist.

Flanked by two beauties—one bewitching, one pure—Guan Yu became the classroom’s focal point. Even Niu Le swiveled his head dazedly between them.

“This activity plan—” Wen Qing indicated her proposal “—involves a ‘Wish Board’ for girls’ requests, paired with your friends’ boys’ division fulfilling them. It’ll energize the whole campus. Thoughts?”

“Solid idea. How to implement it?” Guan Yu asked, unfamiliar with council operations.

“Easy. I’ll guide you through it these days.” Wen Qing’s coy blink sent his pulse racing, cheeks flushing crimson.

Chapter 317: Graceful Prowess

Delighted by his reaction, Wen Qing demurely lowered her gaze to detail the plan.

Fu Lili scowled at their intimacy. “Who knows how he became president anyway?”

Overhearing, Tian Hao muttered, “Ignore that lunatic, sister-in-law. She nearly framed Brother recently.”

Wen Qing’s expression chilled. “What did you say?” she demanded, whirling toward Fu Lili.

“Nothing about you!” Fu Lili retorted, though Wen Qing’s glare unnerved her.

“Trash men others reject become some people’s treasures. Abandoning Xu Wei for garbage—how pathetic!” Fu Lili’s voice rose挑衅ly.

Crack! Wen Qing slammed the desk, rising furiously. “What’s your malfunction?”

“Did I name you? Temper, much?” Fu Lili sneered.

Wen Qing’s face flushed crimson. “One more word, I’ll rip your mouth open!”

“Try it!” Fu Lili stood挑衅ly—only to receive a lightning slap as Wen Qing vaulted over three desks via a sideways somersault.

Smack! The backhanded blow sent Fu Lili sprawling over chairs.

“Think I won’t?” Wen Qing glared down coldly.

Scrambling up, Fu Lili lunged—only to be doubled over by a precise kick to the abdomen. Guan Yu watched, impressed—this wildcat possessed formidable skills!
