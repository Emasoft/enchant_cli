“That is truly splendid, Brother Guan Yu. Your approach has only deepened my fondness for you. Acting decisively and following your heart’s desire aligns perfectly with what I admire. Those who scheme endlessly or wield trivial authority like grand decrees are precisely the sort I cannot abide.”

Elder Wang spoke with a touch of humor. Guan Yu chuckled and replied, “Elder Wang, this junior can see you possess great wit. To earn your appreciation is truly an honor. Brothers behind me, come lend a hand!” he called out.

Elder Wang quickly waved his disciples forward to assist, for the armor was far too large and heavy. Had Guan Yu tried to mount it on the iron pillar alone, he would have struggled mightily.

Beside the crate stood an iron pillar designed to support the armor. Once erected, Guan Yu and Elder Wang’s disciples hoisted the massive, two-meter-tall suit weighing hundreds of pounds onto it.

“Heavens above!” one disciple exclaimed. “I never imagined this could be armor! Over two meters tall and nearly five hundred pounds! Who could possibly wear such a thing in battle?”

Elder Wang stroked his beard thoughtfully. “Hmm, over five hundred pounds… The metal in this armor must be extraordinary. Smaller volume with greater weight suggests remarkable density and hardness. Though the armor appears large, ordinary wrought iron would weigh only around two hundred pounds. This… is perplexing.”

Guan Yu marveled at Elder Wang’s insight. The disciple had merely lent a hand, yet he’d estimated the armor’s weight with startling accuracy—a skill Guan Yu himself lacked.

To gauge weight by sight alone, or even by lifting, was one thing. But to determine it precisely through a mere touch? Such ability seemed almost innate, the mark of someone deeply attuned to calculations.

Though proud of his own talents, Guan Yu knew the martial world brimmed with extraordinary individuals. Today’s encounter proved it. Take Xiao Zhi’s ability to subdue spirit beasts after inheriting the Merit Cauldron—was that not akin to a summoner’s power? The mysteries of this world still far exceeded Guan Yu’s understanding.

Guan Yu raised a thumb to the disciple who’d discerned the weight. “Elder Brother, your skill leaves me in awe. With just a touch, you deduced the armor’s heft—truly remarkable!”

“You flatter me,” the disciple demurred. Elder Wang chuckled. “Your attention to detail impresses me as well. But let me boast a little—each disciple I’ve brought today possesses unique talents you’ll come to appreciate.”

Sect Leader Xuanming clasped his hands respectfully. “Our deepest gratitude for your trust, Elder Wang. Your disciples’ legendary talents are indeed as extraordinary as reputed.”

“Hah! Sect Leader Xuanming need not be so modest. The thanks belong to you. My curiosity about your project drew us here. Whatever novel creation the Cloud Azure Sect undertakes is sure to astonish—and I’ve come prepared to be amazed!”

Elder Wang’s forthrightness, though coming from an outsider, felt refreshingly sincere. Guan Yu warmed to the idea of collaborating with such a man on the hand crossbow project.

“Shall we dismantle the armor now, Elder Wang?” Guan Yu suggested. “Let us uncover the secrets of its peculiar components.”

“Yes, yes! I’ve been eager to begin.” Elder Wang stepped forward, examining the chestplate. He tapped the heart region. “This area… It feels like stone, not metal. Could this be some mineral?”

Guan Yu frowned. “If it’s stone, we’re in trouble. Stone lacks a melting point. Reshaping it would require laborious grinding—hardly ideal for our purposes.”

“Let’s not despair yet,” Elder Wang cautioned. “Innovation rarely succeeds on the first attempt. What makes me think it’s stone? Observe its smooth surface. The armor bears many scars, yet the heart and shoulder areas remain pristine—precisely where attacks would focus. Ordinary weapons couldn’t mark this material.”

He directed his disciples: “Begin dismantling from the base. Proceed carefully.”

Working with practiced skill, the disciples unfastened beast-hide straps and sinews binding the metal plates. Most required cutting, freeing the dark iron segments.

Holding a piece, Elder Wang marveled, “No ordinary iron—this is Dark Profound Iron! Exceedingly rare, with exceptional quality. No wonder the armor’s so heavy!”

**Chapter 3924: The Invited Master**

“Density and weight are clear,” Guan Yu noted, “but what of its hardness and elasticity?”

“An astute question!” Elder Wang approved. “Its true merits lie there. Dark Profound Iron is typically forged into rapiers or flexible swords—ideal for their balance of weight and resilience. Though heavy for armor, its springiness makes perfect blade material. Highly prized, this metal.”

Relief washed over Guan Yu—elasticity was crucial for the crossbow. As the disciples removed hundreds of plates, Elder Wang examined the heart-region stone.

Using a lens-like tool, he concluded, “This appears to be ironstone—a mineral with high iron content.”

Blank looks met his words. Sect Leader Xuanming asked, “Could you elaborate? Is this suitable for our project?”

“Ironstone hasn’t been seen in nearly a century,” Elder Wang explained. “As for suitability… That depends on Master Guan Yu’s design. I’ll need to consult him further.”

Guan Yu bowed. “You honor me, Elder. Your expertise far surpasses mine.”

“Knowledge is endless,” the elder replied humbly. “What I know differs from your understanding. True learning requires lifelong curiosity.”

Guan Yu outlined the crossbow’s needs: “The frame requires elasticity and hardness. In my homeland, tempered steel plates provided both. Without such resources here, we must innovate.” He recalled Western hand crossbows using spring mechanisms—impossible here without advanced tools.

“Dark Profound Iron could serve well,” Elder Wang mused. “Its weight matters less for a compact weapon. But this ironstone…” He hefted the mineral. “May I study a sample? Determining its melting point could prove challenging.”

“By all means,” Guan Yu agreed. “This armor was acquired solely for our project. Use its materials as needed.”

Elder Wang shook his head in wonder. “Such extravagance! Many struggle to obtain enough Dark Profound Iron for a single blade. Yet here you’ve acquired enough for armor!”

A disciple added, “It’s priceless on the market—often unavailable at any price.”

Sect Leader Xuanming shot Guan Yu an amused look. Earlier, the youth had dismissed his purchases as “scrap.” Yet this armor contained treasures beyond measure.

“Dark Profound Iron isn’t just for weapons,” the Sect Leader noted. “Its conductivity makes it excellent for magical implements.”

“Precisely!” Elder Wang agreed. “Though not the supreme metal, its versatility earns it the name ‘Omni-Iron.’”

After reviewing materials, Guan Yu presented blueprints. Elder Wang grasped the mechanisms instantly—a testament to his craftsmanship.

**Chapter 3925: Technical Deliberations**

“This hand crossbow,” Guan Yu explained, “surpasses bows in power and concealment. Fatal when fired unexpectedly.”

Elder Wang studied the schematics intently. “The design is ingenious though complex. With proper facilities and materials, I’ll persist until we succeed—but without time constraints.”

Grinning, Guan Yu produced his Desert Eagle. “Observe this—a firearm from my homeland.”

Elder Wang hefted the pistol, amazed. “Metal… and heavy! What sorcery is this?”

“Fifty meters,” Guan Yu said, “and none evade its projectile.”

“Impossible!” the elder protested.

Sect Leader Xuanming smiled. “Even our sect’s masters cannot dodge it unprepared.”

Disassembling the gun, Guan Yu showed the spring. “Can this be replicated here?”

Elder Wang shook his head. “Such precision… Beyond our current craft.”

“As I feared,” Guan Yu sighed. “No machinery for springs.”

Eager despite this, Elder Wang said, “I must witness this weapon’s power!”

Later, in the mountain workshop, Sect Leader Xuanming gestured expansively. “All facilities are at your disposal. Name any need.”

“More than adequate,” Elder Wang approved, surveying the well-equipped space.

“Shall I assign attendants for your comfort?”

“My disciples handle such matters. Though…” The elder hesitated. “Might we have freedom to procure supplies?”

“Of course,” the Sect Leader assured. “Our guards will facilitate your passages.”

As night fell, Guan Yu noted luminous stones replacing electric lights—another reminder of this world’s unique challenges. Yet with Elder Wang’s expertise, perhaps even springs could be reinvented…
