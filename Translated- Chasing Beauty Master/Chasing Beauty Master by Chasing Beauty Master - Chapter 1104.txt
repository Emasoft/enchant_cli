“Oh dear, what should we do then? Why is Yingzi (Cherry Child) unwilling to give you the money?” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) feigned curiosity as he asked.

Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) rolled his eyes and said, “Cut the nonsense. I want half the money. If you need to give some to the monks inside later, you can go back and ask Yingzi (Cherry Child) for it. Isn’t that a perfect solution? If you ask Yingzi (Cherry Child) for ten million, I’m sure she wouldn’t even bat an eye.”

“I don’t want to deceive Yingzi (Cherry Child),” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) objected. “Here’s what I think, Brother Jinciyu. I know you aren’t short on money, and the amount this time isn’t large. With so many members of the Yu Gang standing here watching, if you take half all at once, people will gossip. How about this—five million for you. Does that work?”

Guan Yu (Pass Universe) inwardly acknowledged that today’s resolution owed much to Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf). Without him, matters would not have concluded so smoothly. Though Guan Yu (Pass Universe) had sought his aid many times, Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) had never reaped any benefits.

This pattern couldn’t continue. Not only would it breed resentment, but it would also dampen Jinciyu Lang’s (Second Only to Wolf) enthusiasm. Thus, Guan Yu (Pass Universe) decided to offer tangible rewards this time to ensure his wholehearted cooperation in the future.

Lately, Guan Yu (Pass Universe) had realized how crucial Jinciyu Lang’s (Second Only to Wolf) presence was during critical moments. Take the Fang Family incident—had Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) been present, it would have been resolved far more simply, without mobilizing so many people.

**Chapter 2823: You Know What’s Good for You**

Appropriately rewarding Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) was necessary. Making him feel valued would ensure his continued loyalty and service.

Having such a supreme expert by his side had made every challenge lighter. Today’s events exemplified this—without Jinciyu Lang’s (Second Only to Wolf) timely arrival, the Yu Gang members, even in full force, would have struggled against Yuan Shanding’s (Mountain Stability) twenty-odd experts, incurring needless casualties.

Even if Jones and the Freedom Organization had intervened, subduing Yuan Shanding (Mountain Stability) would have been far bloodier. Today’s outcome underscored the irreplaceable role of a true master.

“Guan Yu (Pass Universe), you’re too stingy! Do you know my usual rates? A single mission easily exceeds five million!” Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) protested.

After deliberation, Guan Yu (Pass Universe) conceded, “Fine. I’ll meet your demand—ten million. Today’s resolution relied entirely on your timely intervention, which prevented greater losses.”

Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) widened his eyes. “What? You agreed? Did I hear right? Or did you misspeak?” He could scarcely believe it. Previously, such negotiations would drag on endlessly. He’d expected five million at best—enough for a few gambling sprees—but ten million? This sudden generosity felt unreal.

“It’s true,” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) affirmed. “Ten million, as thanks. Without your early arrival, today’s outcome would’ve been far messier.”

A smug grin spread across Jinciyu Lang’s (Second Only to Wolf) face. “So you’ve finally recognized my worth! Ha! Took you long enough to appreciate having a master like me!”

He threw his head back, laughing heartily. After years of friendship—and now familial ties through marriage—this was the first time Guan Yu (Pass Universe) had openly acknowledged his value.

Guan Yu (Pass Universe) continued, “I demanded twenty million. You’ll get ten, Houyuan Temple five for repairs, and the remaining five will be distributed among the Yu Gang brothers. Consider this matter settled.”

Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) clapped Guan Yu’s (Pass Universe) shoulder. “Smart move. This ten million won’t go to waste—you’ll see its worth soon enough.”

Internally, Guan Yu (Pass Universe) mused that even without the payment, Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) wouldn’t abandon Yingzi (Cherry Child). But voicing this would undermine his goal: to bind Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) through genuine loyalty, not obligation.

“Wang Hu (Tiger King), handle the transfers as instructed. Ten million to Brother Jinciyu, five to Shen Sheng (Life Application), and distribute five among all Yu Gang members—not just those present today,” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) ordered.

The five million for Shen Sheng (Life Application) and the monks was both compensation and appeasement. The temple’s main hall lay in ruins, requiring extensive repairs. Rewarding the Yu Gang’s swift mobilization with five million—roughly fifteen thousand per member—boosted morale exponentially.

This was Guan Yu’s (Pass Universe) leadership philosophy: a prosperous brotherhood fostered unity and growth. Today’s resolution left everyone satisfied—Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) elated, the Yu Gang thrilled, and even those uninvolved receiving unexpected windfalls.

At Houyuan Temple, the four monks balked at the five million. Youguang (Following Light) protested, “This is too much! Our injuries, though severe, don’t warrant such sums.”

“Even renovating the main hall wouldn’t cost a tenth of this,” Xiao Bai (Little Hundred) added.

Guan Yu (Pass Universe) had anticipated their refusal. “This is your due—compensation from Bill Lin (Forest), not me. Endure your suffering no longer. Accept it.”

Da Huzi (Big Beard) gruffly interjected, “Use this money meaningfully elsewhere. We mountain-dwellers have little use for wealth.”

“Brother Da Huzi (Big Beard), are you mocking my poverty?” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) teased.

“No! That’s not what I meant!” Da Huzi (Big Beard) flushed, dismayed by the misunderstanding.

“The money is yours,” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) insisted. “Renovate the temple. Remember—it’s from Bill Lin (Forest), not me. I’ve lost nothing; you’ve borne all costs.”

Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) chimed in, “Take it! I’m getting ten million and still feel shortchanged!”

Youguang (Following Light) bowed. “We owe you our lives. Thank you.”

Having worked together多次, the group had grown familiar. Xiao Bai (Little Hundred) asked, “How did you arrive so quickly? We thought we’d meet our ends before help came.”

“Guan Yu (Pass Universe) contacted me while I was gambling nearby. Though reluctant at first, I hurried over upon sensing his urgency,” Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) explained.

He’d sprinted from Ma Family’s casino—two streets from the temple’s foothills—using his First-Class Mid-Level cultivation speed to save Shen Sheng (Life Application) in the nick of time.

Youguang (Following Light) sighed, “We’d nearly surrendered when you stormed in and subdued their leader.”

Guan Yu (Pass Universe) added, “When I received the distress call, I knew the situation was dire. Only Brother Jinciyu could resolve it swiftly. Thankfully, he was nearby.”

Shen Sheng (Life Application), gravely injured, remained bedridden, requiring months of recovery.

Youguang (Following Light) worried aloud, “If those men return, we’re defenseless. Only Xiao Bai (Little Hundred) and I can still fight.”

“They won’t,” Guan Yu (Pass Universe) assured. “Having abandoned Bill Lin (Forest), they pose no further threat.”

With arrangements settled and the injured monks refusing additional aid, Guan Yu (Pass Universe) tasked Wei Hongwei (Grand Might) with delivering medical supplies.

“I bought every bandage and disinfectant from nearby pharmacies,” Wei Hongwei (Grand Might) announced, hauling crates.

Guan Yu (Pass Universe) chuckled, “This is excessive, but replace their makeshift bandages with proper ones to prevent infection.”

Youguang (Following Light) grinned. “I’ll practice on these two.”

As Guan Yu (Pass Universe) departed, Bill Lin (Forest) seethed in the Feng Family’s eastern hall. “Why was Guan Yu (Pass Universe) there? Who leaked the plan?”

Yuan Shanding (Mountain Stability) explained, “We ambushed the monks successfully, but an expert appeared, hostageing me. The Yu Gang arrived afterward.”

Bill Lin (Forest) scoffed, “My spies confirmed Guan Yu (Pass Universe) was home earlier. How did he know?”

Luo Bo (Wave) interjected, “If that expert moved at full speed, reaching the temple in half an hour is plausible.”

Yuan Shanding (Mountain Stability) bowed. “We’ll withdraw to ** Mountain. Our failure cost you dearly. Thank you for your aid.”

Bill Lin (Forest) paled. “You’re leaving? Now?”

“Our error caused your loss. We dare not burden you further.”

**Chapter 2825: A Debt of Honor**

Bill Lin (Forest) stared blankly as Yuan Shanding (Mountain Stability) and his men departed, the plan in ashes and twenty million vanished.
