With a flick of her long whip, she coiled around an Earth Rock Beast and flung it out of the city. Mu Fengchen stared in shock—what was she doing? From his vantage point, it appeared Guan Yu was using the beast to attack them. But soon they realized her true intention: she was clearing the monsters from the city. However, as earth-element creatures, the beasts could simply burrow back underground even after being thrown out.

A dark shadow suddenly caught their attention near the city walls. Who else could it be but Hu Xiaohai? The demonic creature plunged its claws into the ground before retracting them and vanishing. The crowd exchanged puzzled glances, unaware of what it had done.

Hu Xiaohai had already returned to the Soul-Devouring Whip. "Thank you for your efforts," Guan Yu said flatly, though a hint of concern tinged her voice. "It's nothing," came the weak reply. Having exhausted all its energy, the creature now needed rest.

Guan Yu refocused on battling the Earth Rock Beasts. Within moments, many had been hurled beyond the walls by her whip. Unnoticed by her, the onlookers gaped as if witnessing an ant toppling elephants—no, an entire herd! Their eyes widened in disbelief. Was this girl a monster or demon herself? To fling such beasts without using spiritual energy—was she even human?

None knew of Guan Yu's brutal training in the Abyss of Death, where she'd sparred with demonic saints despite her sealed powers. To her, saint-level adversaries held no more terror than earthly warriors. Outside the city, several figures dodged falling boulders while Sun-Devouring Beasts were crushed into pulp beneath the barrage.

"Who dares ambush me?!" Ye Wuhen cursed as he evaded the meteoric stones. His subordinates exchanged exasperated glances. Ming Hanfeng's eyes flickered with suspicion before he reengaged the beasts. Bing Su guarded him diligently, allowing no distractions. Within the city walls, Guan Yu sneezed—someone must be cursing her.

By the time she'd cleared the city of Earth Rock Beasts, the battle outside had intensified. "Asura, tend to your wound," Mu Bai urged, eyeing her bleeding leg. "Unnecessary," came her curt refusal. He left without another word, destination unknown.

Gathering wind elements, Guan Yu leapt toward the outskirts, oblivious to Mu Fengchen's stupefied gaze. A twelve-year-old at Earth Sovereign's peak? More monstrous than Ye Wuhen himself! Outside, Ming Hanfeng struggled against multiple peak-level beasts while Ye Wuhen lounged casually, treating the creatures as unworthy playthings.

Guan Yu's attention fixated on a gentle figure amidst the chaos. She'd allow no harm to come to him—not even from gods themselves!

An Earth Rock Beast materialized behind Ming Hanfeng. Guan Yu's heart lurched. Ignoring her injured leg, she teleported behind him, her whip cracking across the beast's hide. A deep gash appeared as Ming Hanfeng turned, comprehension dawning.

"Thank you, Asura." His grateful smile surprised even himself—the first genuine expression since Xiao Xue's disappearance. Bing Su noted this with raised eyebrows before resuming combat.

"Only my duty," Guan Yu replied tersely, relief flashing in her eyes before bloodlust consumed them. "You'll die for this!" Her glare could have slain the beast a thousandfold. Trembling, the creature attempted to burrow to safety.

"Escape? After nearly harming him?" She pressed a delicate palm to the earth. Stone spikes erupted, pursuing the fleeing beast. Ming Hanfeng's eyes widened—a dual-element cultivator!

Back in the city, puzzlement reigned. "Why can't the beasts reenter?" A sudden cry pierced the air: "Metal! The walls are lined with metal!" The crowd murmured understanding—Hu Xiaohai's hidden defense.

Cornered by crystalline thorns, the Earth Rock Beast surfaced desperately. Guan Yu gave chase on wind currents, intercepting it effortlessly. The creature gaped—dual elements indeed!

Chapter 1581: Weakness of Earth Rock Beasts

Ye Wuhen observed Guan Yu between strikes, intrigued. Her whip lashed not at the beast's stony hide, but its eyes. A deafening roar shook the battlefield as the blinded creature collapsed, viscous blood pooling beneath it.

The crowd stared aghast. This child showed no flicker at the gore, earning newfound respect. Ye Wuhen's gaze darkened thoughtfully.

Emboldened by her example, warriors targeted the beasts' vulnerable eyes. Soon only Sun-Devourers remained. Landing gingerly, Guan Yu's leg buckled. Ming Hanfeng materialized beside her. "Stay behind me," he commanded gruffly, surprising himself with the protective urge.

Ye Wuhen watched mockingly as his retainers gaped—their master, moved by a girl? During the distraction, a shadowy figure erupted beneath Ming Hanfeng, slamming him against the walls. Blood trickled from his lips.

Guan Yu's fury ignited. Floating crimson-haired above the fray, she chanted: "Crimson Moon Devours Clouds!" The sky darkened blood-red. Ye Wuhen frowned at this disruption, while others marveled—how could an Earth Sovereign unleash saint-level power?

Wreathed in crimson mist, Guan Yu resembled a blooming spider lily—deadly and mesmerizing. Her Soul-Devouring Whip became a silver blur, dismembering beasts with cruel precision. The crowd recoiled—a spirit artifact! But their awe turned to horror as the whip reduced even Earth Rock Beasts to gravel.

Just as her energy waned, a ancient magic circle flared beneath Guan Yu—four stars orbiting a sword emblem. Gasps erupted: "Saint Sovereign—at twelve?!" She smirked inwardly. Had Hong Feng not suppressed her powers, this breakthrough would've come sooner.

Chapter 1582: Mu Feng City

Retreating beasts thought themselves safe until emerald vines ensnared them, dragging victims back into the crimson storm. Thorns shredded flesh and stone alike, onlookers shuddering at the girl's merciless efficiency.

When Ye Wuhen suddenly appeared behind Guan Yu, both struck simultaneously—not at each other, but an ambushing Earth Rock Beast! The saint-level creature exploded mid-leap. Mu Fengchen exhaled in relief—had the demon prince perished here, their city would've faced apocalyptic retribution.

Guan Yu studied her unexpected ally warily. Why save a stranger? Ye Wuhen himself didn't know—instinct had moved him. Their locked gazes held caution and intrigue respectively.

Ming Hanfeng's unnoticed relief turned to confusion. Why did this girl's safety matter so? Guan Yu's reassuring smile only deepened the mystery.

With final whip cracks, the last beasts fell. Guan Yu descended, leg buckling. Before Ye Wuhen could react, Ming Hanfeng was there. "Are you hurt?" The tenderness in his voice startled even Bing Su.

"Nothing serious... brother... Your Highness." The corrected title dimmed her crimson eyes. Ming Hanfeng's inexplicable pang went unvoiced.

As the survivors regrouped, none noticed the lingering gazes—Ye Wuhen's calculating, Ming Hanfeng's protective, and Guan Yu's veiled turmoil. The battle had ended, but deeper storms brewed beneath Mu Feng City's bloodstained skies.
