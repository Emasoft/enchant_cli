After swaying slightly, Moya (Demon Tooth) abandoned his focus on the five polar bears and concentrated all his strength into his right foot. Guanyu's body sank another half-chi into the ice cave, now submerged up to his waist.

Guanyu spat another mouthful of blood. Crimson trails seeped from the corners of his eyes as every muscle strained to its limit, the skin around his eyelids splitting from the exertion.

Xue Jing's heart bled as she watched. Most of her new body had now materialized - the lower half of her form had already sublimated above the ice platform. In less than five minutes, the full reconstruction would complete. When finished, her power might rival Moya's own.

But could Guanyu endure these final ten minutes?

A sharp *crack* echoed as Guanyu's body suddenly lurched leftward.

"Gahaha! Did your left leg bone just snap?" Moya extended a serpentine tongue to moisten his lips, eyes gleaming with perverse delight like a diner anticipating a feast.

The words pierced Xue Jing's heart. A burst of radiant energy leaked from her form, causing her left side to momentarily flicker as if dissolving.

Though fully occupied resisting Moya's pressure, Guanyu's spiritual sense remained attuned to Xue Jing. Sensing her instability, he transmitted mentally: "Beloved, you must maintain focus! If your reconstruction fails, my death would be meaningless! Our only hope lies in your success. Fear not - I, Guanyu, have survived countless tribulations. Do you think I'd perish so easily?"

As the transmission ended, another *crack* resounded - his right leg bone now fractured. [800]

Xue Jing understood that emotional distraction would hasten Guanyu's demise. Nodding resolutely, she responded: "Understood, husband. Endure a little longer! Once my body completes, we'll roast this demon over slow flames!"

Through excruciating pain, Guanyu managed a mental chuckle: "Silly wife, these demons lack flesh to roast. At best, they'd emit wisps of smoke." Fresh blood spilled from his lips. Xue Jing dared not respond further, withdrawing all spiritual senses to concentrate wholly on her task.

With renewed focus, the stray energy currents stabilized. Her bodily reconstruction visibly accelerated.

Both legs now shattered, sweat cascaded down Guanyu's face like waterfalls. Yet his jaw remained clenched - not a whimper escaped.

"How fascinating," Moya mused. "Though humans are the weakest race across myriad realms, your comprehension and endurance surpass all others. This bone-crushing agony would break even demons. Yet a mere mortal withstands it. But know this - nothing brings me greater joy than watching stubborn wills shatter. Your eventual collapse and groveling shall be exquisite!"

Despite his mocking tone, hidden shock gripped Moya. In his home realm, this same stomping power had pulverized a peak Saint-Realm spirit beast. Though inferior to demonic physiques, beastkin bodies far surpassed human frailty. That this mortal still resisted defied all expectations.

Another sickening *snap* - Guanyu's left arm bent outward at an unnatural right angle, elbow shattered.

Jones had just struggled upright when a second *crack* announced the right arm's destruction.

"Master!!" Jones screamed, bloody tears streaking his cheeks. From their first meeting, some profound karmic bond had linked him to Guanyu. Witnessing his mentor's torment now felt like daggers twisting in his heart. A metallic tang flooded his throat as he vomited crimson.

Using shattered elbows and skull to brace against Moya's foot, Guanyu rasped: "Jones... flee... now!"

"Never!" Jones crawled forward on torn palms, ice scraping his flesh. "We live or die together!"

The five polar bears continued futile attacks until their leader roared, ejecting a fist-sized crystalline orb from its maw.

"Beast Core?!" Moya's eyes flashed with greed, yet maintaining pressure on Guanyu left no opportunity for theft.

Following their alpha, the other bears expelled their cores. The five orbs formed a rotating pentagram in midair.

*Is this... a Beast Spirit Formation?* Guanyu realized silently, beyond speech now.

Moya suddenly sensed danger. With a final stomp, Guanyu's shoulders collapsed inward. His neck snapped audibly, eyes bulging as reverse-flowing energy erupted from his dantian. A torrent of blood and organ fragments gushed forth. His paper-white form plunged completely beneath the ice.

"MASTER!!" Jones' despair unleashed hidden reserves. He lunged at Moya's throat with clawed hands.

Chapter 1774: Amnesia

The Drifter vanished like morning mist, leaving only a golden wisp. Though the light approached slowly, each moment tormented Xue Jing. She mentally cursed the Drifter's ancestors - why couldn't this process hasten?

Finally, the glow infused Guanyu, Jones, and the bears. The polar bears stirred first, now diminutive and docile. They tumbled around Xue Jing's feet like cubs with their mother, but her attention remained fixed on Guanyu.

Anxiety spiked Xue Jing's blood pressure. Darkness encroached...

Suddenly! Silver radiance erupted from Guanyu's form. Before Xue Jing could react, his body transformed into a colossal argent sword that shot from the ice cave straight toward her.

"AAARGH!!" Moya's shriek pierced the air. The demon had stealthily returned to ambush Xue Jing, only to be impaled by the meteoric blade.

Instant annihilation. Focused entirely on his sneak attack, Moya never anticipated Guanyu's resurgence. His dissolving form left behind a dark-glowing object.

"Boundary Sovereign's Sacred Relic!"

Guanyu grasped the irregular black sphere reeking of decay. These relics only manifested when beings above peak Boundary Sovereign perished - a rare occurrence given their near-immortality and escape capabilities. For ordinary humans, absorbing such a relic could elevate them directly to Boundary Sovereign power. For those already beyond, its benefits diminished sharply.

Guanyu assessed his cultivation - now at peak Boundary Sovereign. The ice cave's trials had unexpectedly boosted his strength. Part of him wished to linger in that empowering cold...

Xue Jing threw herself into his arms, showering him with kisses - a stark contrast to her usual icy goddess demeanor.

"Ahem..." Jones' awkward cough interrupted. Guanyu scratched his head sheepishly.

"Want to join?" Xue Jing teased. "I'll share an arm!"

"Enough," Guanyu chuckled. "This place reeks of danger. Let's depart."

Retrieving the Water Origin, Xue Jing marveled as the freezing artifact transformed into a warm crystalline gem. The trio departed with their five bear companions.

"Xue Jing... You've reached Saint Sovereign?!" Guanyu exclaimed upon sensing her energy.

"And the Drifter called me Ice Goddess," she preened, recounting events since his fall.

"Other Origins seal different deities?" Guanyu pondered. "Was the Drifter truly guiding me, or exploiting us to awaken these powers? Is Earth's crisis real, or his fabricated pretext?"

Regardless, the path ahead remained clear. For loved ones' safety, he had no choice but to continue unsealing the remaining four Origins.

Yet all this proved illusion. Xue Jing awoke still entombed in ice. Her desperate fantasies had birtched scenarios of salvation. Reality showed Guanyu lifeless beside her.

"Wake! PLEASE!" She shook him violently, tears freezing mid-fall.

Guanyu's eyelids fluttered open. "Who... are you? Where is this?"

Lightning struck Xue Jing's soul. "Husband! I'm Xue Jing!"

"Xue... Jing?" Blank eyes met hers. "Shouldn't I be in class?"

Chapter 1775: Kaei Academy

The eighteen-year-old girl who became the revered Ice Goddess now faced her greatest trial. For love, she'd risked qi deviation and sealed her own cultivation. Nothing mattered except staying with her amnesiac beloved.

Back in Y City, Guanyu slept three days straight as Xue Jing kept vigil. Upon waking, his memory loss became apparent. Friends collectively treated recent events as bad dreams, never to be mentioned.

With most powers sealed, Guanyu reverted to his teenage self. Xue Jing enrolled them both at A City's prestigious Kaei Academy - a gathering place for scions of nobility, celebrities, and magnates.

At Classroom 3-1's entrance, Guanyu frowned at their male homeroom teacher, Liu Shuowei. "Why's the teacher male this time? Did Xue Jing arrange this?"

"Welcome, Guan Yu." Mr. Liu gestured to a seat beside class beauty LÃ¼ Mei. Angry glares from male classmates followed - none dared oppose the teacher's arrangement in this strict hierarchy where every student held formidable backing.

Thus began a new chapter where an amnesiac cultivator, his goddess lover, and hidden dangers converged in academia's glittering world.
