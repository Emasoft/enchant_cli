“Soon, we’re already at my place,” Lin Qiaoqiao (Skillful and Clever) sighed with reluctance, her tone petulant. “Ugh, why did you drive so fast? I still have so much to say to you!”

“It’s late,” Guan Yu replied. “You need rest for work tomorrow, and your parents were upset earlier. You should hurry home to reassure them. There’ll be plenty of time later—you can always visit me in Qiaoyuan District.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu wanted to rid himself of this troublesome girl quickly. He had urgent business—meeting Jin Hua (Golden Flower) to unravel the secrets of the golden dagger. But Lin Qiaoqiao stubbornly refused to leave the car.

“That doesn’t make sense!” she argued. “If Jingjing forbade you from going out alone, where will you go after I leave? If something happens to you, she’ll skin me alive! Stay at my place tonight. Jingjing lent you to me for a full day—twenty-four hours! It hasn’t even been half that time. You’re still mine.”

Few girls could so boldly insist on housing a man overnight. Lin Qiaoqiao was one of a kind.

Guan Yu frowned. He’d only pretended to be her boyfriend, and the ruse was already exposed. Yet she claimed ownership? By her logic, he’d remain her “boyfriend” until noon tomorrow?

“Don’t be absurd,” he countered. “Your parents know I’m a fraud. They’d chase me out! I have matters to attend to. Another time, alright?”

Finally relenting, Lin Qiaoqiao stepped out. Watching her enter the building, Guan Yu drove off. Avoiding direct routes, he ditched his conspicuous car near Hua Ye Club’s backstreet and called Hou Jinshun (Golden Favorable). “Send me a vehicle. Discreetly.”

Hou Jinshun soon arrived in an ordinary sedan. “Take my car and loop around before returning,” Guan Yu instructed, swapping vehicles.

As he headed to Jin Hua’s, a black SUV tailed him through multiple streets. Normally, Guan Yu would lure pursuers to a remote area and eliminate them. But after recent police incidents, caution prevailed—unknown adversaries might wield heavy weaponry.

Doubling back to Hua Ye Club, Guan Yu slipped inside, bypassing crowds for the restroom. Hou Jinshun monitored the stalkers, who idled across the street, waiting.

The pursuers weren’t enemies—likely either Yang family spies or Fang Su’s lackeys. Slipping out the club’s rear, Guan Yu boarded a prepared van and zigzagged through streets until certain he’d shaken all tails.

At Pan Taisheng’s apartment, Jin Hua yanked Guan Yu inside the moment he knocked. Dressed meticulously, she coiled around him like an eager serpent…

Post-reunion, nearing 5 a.m., Guan Yu produced the golden dagger. “Do these symbols mean anything?”

Jin Hua compared it to her demonic tome. “It’s an incantation! I recognize fragments—mentions of blood and women…”

The dagger, she deduced, was a cursed vessel. “Melting or breaking it would destroy the contents. The spell must be unraveled properly.”

At Guan Yu’s urging, Jin Hua pricked her finger, smearing blood on the blade. Symbols blazed—the dagger glowed white-hot, fusing to her hand. Convulsing, she collapsed, pale and bleeding from seven orifices.

Panicked, Guan Yu channeled internal energy into her body, discovering a rampaging astral fire ravaging her organs. Battling the entity, he redirected it into himself, vomiting blood before blacking out.

**Chapter 2,456: Vanished**

Two days later, Xue Jing (Quiet Serenity) frantically called everyone—Guan Yu had vanished. Lin Qiaoqiao, guilt-stricken, joined the search. Even Hou Jinshun only knew Guan Yu had borrowed a car.

Jin Hua’s existence—known only to Guan Yu and the nurse Ling’er—emerged as a lead. But Ling’er found no answers from Qu Shuangshuang (Double Joy).

As panic gripped Qiaoyuan District, Xue Jing clung to calm. “Don’t alert the elder sisters yet. Guan Yu’s skilled—he might be avoiding us deliberately.”

**Chapter 2,457: Something’s Wrong**

Ling’er, recalling Jin Hua, hurried to her apartment. The silence there felt ominous. Meanwhile, Jin Hua lay unconscious, her fate uncertain as Guan Yu’s absence stretched into crisis.
