“At this moment, Patriarch Fang no longer wished to linger before Guan Yu. The farther he stayed from this man, the better. Though he had lost the entire Fang family’s fortune, at least his life was spared.

Fang Su, for his part, dared not dwell on the hardships to come. Surviving this ordeal was enough. Had he not handed over everything to Guan Yu, he knew Guan Yu would never have let them go.

‘Very well. Spare my life, and the Fang family’s assets are yours,’ Patriarch Fang declared. Though every fiber of his being resisted, the gun pressed to his head left no room for refusal.

‘Good. Had you been this cooperative earlier, things needn’t have come to this,’ Guan Yu replied coldly. ‘I show no mercy to my enemies. You’ll endure this night in discomfort. By tomorrow, lawyers will handle the formalities.’

Rising to his feet, Guan Yu ordered Wei Hongwei and his men to bind Fang Su and his son, then haul them away to spend the night at the Yu Gang’s stronghold.

‘Post guards in shifts. If they escape, recapturing them will be impossible,’ Guan Yu instructed Wei Hongwei.

‘Don’t worry, Boss. Jia Bo, Wang Hu, and I will personally oversee them tonight. Nothing will go wrong,’ Wei Hongwei vowed.

By tomorrow, the Fang family would belong to Guan Yu. Beyond seizing their wealth, he would acquire properties and companies—assets that, once auctioned, would swell his coffers further. Anticipating a share of the spoils, Wei Hongwei eagerly volunteered to guard the Fang father and son.

These two were golden geese; losing them was unthinkable.

With most matters settled, only trivialities remained for tomorrow. The sole regret tonight was Poison Widow’s escape. Her alliance with Bill Lin would surely bring Guan Yu greater troubles ahead.

On the return journey, Xue Jing asked, ‘Do you truly intend to spare Fang Su?’ Knowing Guan Yu’s hatred for the man—rooted in the shooting incident that had endangered his life—she doubted he would show leniency.

**Chapter 2,756: A Potential Ally**

Guan Yu explained, ‘Once I claim the Fang family’s assets tomorrow, I’ll send them abroad—to the most backward nation on earth. Let them fend for themselves there. They won’t survive long, which is kinder than killing them outright.’

Xue Jing nodded. Exiling them to such a hellscape was crueler than execution. ‘I knew you wouldn’t let them off lightly. Keeping them alive risks future threats. Your ruthlessness surprises even me.’

‘They sought my life. Mercy has no place here,’ Guan Yu replied flatly.

Luo Bo had escorted Poison Widow away. Earlier, Ganbiri and her men had lain in ambush near the Fang estate’s rear gate. Yet upon seeing the two figures emerge, they wisely stayed hidden.

Ganbiri sensed these were no ordinary foes—especially the old man, whose aura radiated formidable power. Discretion prevailed.

Guan Yu later praised Ganbiri’s prudence. Had she attacked, they’d have been slaughtered. Without Second Wolf’s presence, none could match Luo Bo.

Upon reaching the Feng residence, Bill Lin awaited Poison Widow. He had heard tales of her infamy.

Luo Bo spoke first: ‘Young Master, I’ve brought the one you tasked me to aid. If there’s nothing else, I shall retire.’

‘Rest well. You’ve earned it,’ Bill Lin replied, rising from his sofa. With a courteous gesture, he added, ‘I am Bill Lin. Please, honored guest, take a seat.’

His deference pleased Poison Widow, who thrived on fear and admiration. She sat without ceremony, fatigue weighing on her. A servant brought water, but Bill Lin’s next words drew suspicion: ‘You must be weary from your journey. Drink, and refresh yourself.’

‘No need,’ she declined. ‘Why aid me? We are strangers.’ Years in the underworld had taught her caution—drinks could be drugged, loyalty bought with poisons. She would not become another’s puppet.

Bill Lin smiled. ‘Strangers no longer. Your recent exploits intrigued me. We share a common enemy, which makes us natural allies.’

‘A common enemy?’ She guessed he meant Guan Yu, though her involvement was merely professional. Were she to withdraw now, Guan Yu might let her be.

‘Precisely. Guan Yu,’ Bill Lin affirmed, seating himself. ‘Your feud with him runs deep. He crushed the Fangs. Will you not join me in destroying him?’

‘Guan Yu is the Fangs’ enemy, not mine. My contract ended with their downfall. I’ve no interest in your feud,’ Poison Widow stated coolly.

‘Ended? How naïve,’ Bill Lin scoffed, masking frustration. ‘Guan Yu hunts every threat relentlessly. Do you think he’ll let you walk free? He’ll pursue you to the ends of the earth.’

Her brow furrowed. ‘Is this true?’

‘Would I lie now?’ Bill Lin pressed. ‘Take Fang Su’s case: Guan Yu stole his betrothed on their engagement day, then hounded him mercilessly. The man is a beast.’

Poison Widow absorbed this. If Guan Yu truly held grudges so viciously, her life would become flight and fear. Against his forces, she stood little chance.

‘So you claim Guan Yu will come for me next?’

‘Undoubtedly. He spares no one—not even the Feng family, whom he nearly destroyed over petty slights. My intervention alone saved them.’

Bill Lin’s plea was strategic. After losing Ma Tong, he needed fresh pawns. Poison Widow’s reputation and resources made her ideal.

Yet she shook her head. ‘I’ve seen Guan Yu’s strength tonight. I cannot oppose him alone, nor do I seek entanglements. I work solo.’

‘Elder Sister,’ Bill Lin implored, adopting familiarity, ‘even if you flee, Guan Yu will find you. Stay. Help me, and we’ll split his wealth—you taking the lion’s share.’

Her interest flickered at the mention of riches. ‘Very well. I’ve little to offer beyond my worn hide, a hundred followers, and the full might of the Dark Sun Organization.’

Bill Lin beamed. ‘Rest a few days. We’ll observe Guan Yu’s moves, then devise a plan.’

As servants brought wine, he toasted: ‘To our partnership.’

‘To your timely rescue,’ she countered. They drank.

‘Given your seniority and fearsome reputation,’ Bill Lin ventured, ‘may I call you Elder Sister Poison?’

She smirked. ‘Of course… Little Brother Bill.’

They drank and conversed, Bill Lin subtly probing: ‘With your years in the jianghu, you must have many allies.’

‘Survival demands it,’ she replied, recalling a past close call—a midnight encounter with duplicitous lovers in a forest, their treachery fueling her hatred for faithless men. One such wretch had met his end by her blade, his callousness sealing his fate.

**Chapter 2,761: No Exceptions**

‘All men are scum,’ she mused bitterly. ‘Not one deserves mercy.’
