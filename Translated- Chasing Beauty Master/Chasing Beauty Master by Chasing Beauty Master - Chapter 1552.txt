“Magistrate Mao, thank you for your hospitality these past two days. If I ever have the opportunity to return, I shall certainly stay here for several days,” Prince Zou said.

“Your Highness is always welcome,” Magistrate Mao replied.

Zou Wuhui announced loudly, “Your Highness, all preparations are complete. We may depart at any moment.”

Prince Zou nodded. “Very well. Let us set out according to the planned route. First to Ao Tian Manor.”

The path to the capital did not pass through Ao Tian Manor, which lay southwest of their current position, while the capital lay due south. Prince Zou’s detour to Ao Tian Manor likely aimed to stabilize affairs before continuing onward.

Ao Tian Manor occupied the remote western mountain region, an area sparsely populated with small towns and villages. The manor itself belonged to Prince Zou, its master Ao Shiyuan being his longtime friend from the martial world.

Their friendship had begun decades earlier when Prince Zou was still a disciple of the Yunqing Sect. At that time, Ao Shiyuan had been a petty hustler caught in a street scam exposed by the prince. Their rivalry transformed into lasting camaraderie.

After Prince Zou saved the emperor, he ensured his friend benefited from the imperial rewards. Using the silver provided by the prince, Ao Shiyuan established Ao Tian Manor.

For years, Ao Shiyuan dreamed of elevating his family’s martial arts, but their techniques remained mediocre, never achieving prominence. Undeterred, he trained disciples diligently at the manor. Though progress was slow, their skills steadily improved.

Prince Zou, meanwhile, had long abandoned Yunqing Sect’s mystical arts. Upon becoming a prince, sect rules forbade him from practicing their techniques. He chose wealth and comfort over cultivation, growing soft over the years.

Magistrate Mao arranged a spacious carriage for the prince’s comfort. The procession set out toward Ao Tian Manor, with Guan Yu and his companions riding close behind the carriage for protection.

Wang Jun whispered to Guan Yu, “Why does Prince Zou travel by carriage? This pace is too slow. If he rode horseback, we’d reach Ao Tian Manor by nightfall.”

Xiao Zhi added, “Indeed. With this lumbering carriage, we’ll need until tomorrow morning. Why not fly him directly to the capital by sword?”

“Fool!” Wang Jun snapped. “That would reveal the prince’s ties to martial sects. The emperor would have his head for conspiring with Yunqing disciples!”

Guan Yu nodded. “The emperor summons the prince to lure out conspirators. Any haste might spoil the trap. This carriage may yet prove problematic.”

“Do you foresee trouble?” Wang Jun asked.

“Merely a hunch. The real danger lies in the forested western hills we’ll reach by dusk. Expect ambushes there.”

“Don’t jinx us,” Wang Jun said. “This open grassland offers no cover for ambushes.”

At Yunqing Sect, Xuan Ming sat in Tiger Peak Hall with Chief Lu and Elder Wang. Several crates of materials lay nearby. “Elder Wang, these materials should aid your crossbow crafting,” Chief Lu said.

Xuan Ming inquired, “How progresses the handcrafted crossbow?”

“With steady materials, I can complete one in five days,” Elder Wang replied.

“Excellent. Once Guan Yu returns, we’ll use his ironstone to forge superior weapons for our disciples.”

Elder Wang frowned. “Without Guan Yu’s input, assessing the crossbows’ quality proves difficult.”

“He’ll return soon from his mission,” Xuan Ming assured. After dismissing them, Xuan Ming searched Guan Yu’s quarters, finding ironstones openly displayed on a table.

“Clever boy,” Xuan Ming chuckled, gathering the precious stones.

Chief Lu observed, “Chief Xiang received two stones for his research. Perhaps he’ll craft formidable weapons.”

“Indeed. Though distributing such treasures among disciples breeds envy,” Xuan Ming mused. The dilemma lingered: whether to forge multiple minor enhancements or a single peerless artifact.

As they departed, Xuan Ming offered, “Choose a stone for yourself, Brother Lu. Your service merits reward.”
