Zou Wuhui rode alone at full gallop back to Bladeless Inn, determined to hire bodyguards for the prince. Yet most residents here were martial arts masters with two ingrained habits – their aversion to court affairs as wandering martial artists, and their inherent arrogance born from formidable skills.

Though aware of this, Zou pressed onward to fulfill the prince's command. His solitary ride proved swift, covering the distance in slightly over two hours. Upon arrival, he first secured a room. Remarkably, the youth at the entrance hut remembered him.

"Didn't you leave yesterday? Why return?" the young man inquired curiously.

Dust-covered and weary from sleepless nights, Zou replied, "Just get me a room. I'll visit the kitchen for food first."

"Oh? Alone this time? Where are your companions?" The attendant asked while retrieving a key from the cabinet.

"Traveling solo." Zou tossed silver onto the counter before taking the key.

His hunger urgent, Zou headed straight to the kitchen. After replenishing his strength, he pondered how to advertise his recruitment. Mere waiting proved ineffective, and direct inquiries seemed equally futile.

Finally inspiration struck – posting notices near the kitchen where all residents congregated. Zou procured paper and ink, writing: "Generous remuneration offered to skilled escorts for protective mission. Silver no object for capable hands. Inquire within."

Using rice paste, he affixed the notice to the pavilion pillars as noon approached. Settling beside his advertisement with a stool, Zou awaited applicants. This remained his best strategy – failure would mean returning empty-handed.

"Who permitted this posting?" A gruff voice demanded from behind.

Zou turned to see a square-faced man with unkempt, nest-like hair and prominent straight eyebrows – appearing around fifty. Though disheveled, his robes remained immaculate. Assuming him to be staff, Zou smiled ingratiatingly.

"Honored sir, I urgently require assistance. If this inconveniences you, perhaps we might..."

"All postings are forbidden here. Remove it immediately!" The man snapped coldly.

"What's this commotion, Uncle Lai?" The familiar attendant youth approached.

Zou seized the opportunity. "Young friend, perhaps you could intercede? I merely seek to hire help." He subtly pressed silver into the youth's hand.

The attendant recoiled. "Don't tempt me! Our manager stands right here."

"Manager?" Zou feigned ignorance.

"You don't recognize Manager Lai?" The youth explained. "One of Bladeless Inn's three stewards. His word governs here."

Realizing the authority he faced, Zou produced two silver ingots. "Honorable Lai, consider this compensation. My mission benefits all – profit for your guests, aid for my cause."

The attendant tactfully withdrew as Lai pocketed the silver, expression softening slightly. "Your notice disrupts our operations. Those lodging here have their own purposes."

"Necessity compels me," Zou persisted, recognizing greed in Lai's eyes. "Only your establishment houses suitable candidates."

After two more ingots changed hands, Lai finally relented. "Remove it by evening then." The manager stalked off, leaving Zou to his vigil.

As noon crowds gathered, most ignored the notice until an enormous man – easily three hundred pounds with flesh spilling over his belt – inquired about payment terms. His mountainous frame made Zou doubt his martial prowess.

"Protection details remain confidential," Zou deflected. "Name your price."

"Two days' hard ride to the capital?" The fat man calculated.

"By carriage," Zou corrected. "Duration uncertain."

The man demanded fifty taels, claiming solitary capability. Zou requested demonstration, leading to an embarrassing scuffle where the lumbering figure tripped over himself. Dismissing this farce, Zou amended his notice: "Applicants must surpass my own skill."

This amendment drew swarming challengers. The first – a scar-faced giant – disarmed Zou effortlessly... then rejected the mission. Bewildered, Zou faced an expanding queue of combatants, the crowd pressing closer as afternoon shadows lengthened.
