These people were already wary of cultivators, and now Aze's spell had nearly killed their servant. No wonder they were furious.

Aze spread his hands helplessly. "Come on, I used the simplest and weakest spell possible. How was I to know your servant couldn't withstand even that? It wasn't intentional – don't blame me unfairly."

The steward tried to speak, but Old Master Zhao stood up, raising his hand to silence him. He glanced at Aze and said coolly, "Duels have rules. This young master has fairly won. We must accept this outcome."

"However," the Zhao patriarch continued, "while your magic is formidable, I cannot risk lives here. Though your spell gravely injured someone, I'll let that pass. Still, I cannot permit further challenges. You may withdraw."

Aze looked stunned. "You never forbade cultivators from participating! And I truly used the weakest spell in my repertoire!"

"You still severely wounded my man," the patriarch countered. "If you duel my daughter next, you might injure her similarly. I cannot allow that. We'll address other matters later, but for now, this challenge ends."

Aze turned to Guan Yu in frustration. With the Zhao family withdrawing consent, nothing could be done. Still, it rankled how they'd underestimated him by sending that feeble old man first – of course he'd been defeated.

Chapter 4398: You're Right

"Very well," Aze conceded. "I didn't realize your men were so fragile. My mistake. Farewell." He turned to leave.

"Wait!" Zhao Xue sprang up, her voice clear as jade chimes. "I'll duel him."

"Xue'er, this isn't a game," her father warned. "His magic is dangerously unrestrained. You saw what happened to Ah Gou. From now on, we'll simply refuse magical challengers."

"But I truly wish to test myself," Zhao Xue insisted, stepping onto the platform. "His spellcasting was slow – Ah Gou underestimated him and didn't dodge. Otherwise, it wouldn't have connected at all."

Clearly ignoring her father's concerns, the young mistress positioned herself center stage. Sensing opportunity, Aze turned back with a smile. "The Zhao heiress shows remarkable spirit. I accept."

"Xue'er, if you're injured today's proceedings will be delayed!" the patriarch fretted, though knowing his daughter's stubbornness. In the Zhao household, even his faintest cough commanded instant obedience – except from this willful girl who danced around his authority.

"Don't worry, Father," Zhao Xue said breezily. "His spells might sting, but they're not lethal. Are you ready?" she asked Aze.

"Not quite." Aze glanced at the glowering patriarch and steward. "Do I have permission to continue? Who actually decides here?"

"I do," Zhao Xue declared, beating her father to the response. "My word rules here. I've never dueled a spellcaster before." She eyed the large brush in his hand. "That's no scholar's tool – it's a magic artifact, isn't it?"

Guan Yu noted the girl's sudden shift from haughty noble to approachable conversationalist. "Correct," Aze admitted freely.

"Then let's skip the duel," Zhao Xue proposed. "No offense, but you're no match for me. Instead, demonstrate some spells. Impress me, and you win."

Aze's smile turned wry. Was he being treated as some street performer? Yet considering his poor combat speed, this compromise suited him. "What kind of demonstration would satisfy you? I'd hate to waste energy for naught."

"Show your most powerful magic. The rest isn't your concern." Her commanding tone betrayed years of privilege.

Guan Yu observed the playful noble. This wasn't about fairness – she simply wanted spectacle. For the gold-rich Zhaos, a few ingots were trivial.

"Should we recall him?" Siqi whispered. "She's toying with him."

"Let him decide," Guan Yu said. Wang Jun snorted ahead: "He's smitten. Wouldn't leave if we dragged him."

True enough, Aze stood eager. "Since Miss Zhao requests it, I'll oblige." He gestured to a weapon rack. "Clear the area. I'll target that."

As Zhao Xue retreated, the crowd murmured in anticipation. Even the patriarch didn't object – mere demonstrations couldn't harm anyone.

Aze raised his brush vertically. The artifact hovered mid-air as he chanted. Guan Yu recognized the Lightning Summoning Technique, though Siqi could cast it faster without tools or incantations.

Chapter 4399: As It Should Be

"Still holding back?" Wang Jun muttered. "This isn't his strongest spell."

"Perhaps he has reasons," Guan Yu said, noting Aze's strained expression. Storing spiritual energy in artifacts took effort – maybe he conserved power.

Sunlight dimmed as thunderheads gathered above. Two ear-splitting cracks later, lightning shattered the weapon rack, scattering blades across the stage.

"Not bad," Siqi admitted. Wang Jun scoffed: "Give me that time, I could match it."

Guan Yu chuckled. "Impressive enough. Those blessed by the Merit Cauldron should excel."

The crowd stared awestruck. To mortals, summoning heaven's wrath seemed divine. Old Master Zhao shuddered – had this lightning struck his daughter...

Zhao Xue herself looked thrilled. "Magnificent! But one trick won't suffice. Show us more!"

"I'm no carnival act," Aze said stiffly. "Though since I'm here... What else would you see?"

"Your ultimate technique. We're all eager to witness true power."

Guan Yu recognized the girl's capricious nature – beautiful but troublesome. Aze might fancy her, but she'd lead him like a puppy.

Resigned, Aze raised his brush again. Its gemstone glowed brighter than sunlight. "A mid-grade artifact," Guan Yu noted. "The dream of many cultivators."

"What's he conjuring now?" Wang Jun asked as spiritual energy swirled.

"Zheng Shouzhu's signature move – the Electric Vortex," Siqi identified. "A devastating area spell."

Dark clouds churned above. The air buzzed as energy coalesced. Aze's chant grew urgent, his brush channeling stored power. With final shout, he slammed the artifact downward.

Instead of lightning, a whirling vortex of electricity materialized, sucking debris into its core. The weapon rack's remnants disintegrated into sparking dust. Gasps erupted as the maelstrom faded, leaving scorch marks radiating across the stage.

Chapter 4400: Drawn In

"Sufficient?" Aze panted, sweat dripping. Maintaining the vortex had drained him.

Zhao Xue clapped delightedly. "Marvelous! But how about—"

Her words died as residual energy suddenly surged. The dying vortex flared back to life, tendrils lashing out. Before anyone reacted, Zhao Xue's hairpin flew toward the electrical whirlpool – dragging her with it.

"Aze!" Guan Yu shouted. But the cultivator was already moving, diving to tackle Zhao Xue clear as the vortex collapsed in on itself with thunderous finality.

Silence fell. Then the crowd erupted in panicked cheers. Pale but unharmed, Zhao Xue stared up at her rescuer. Aze's brush lay broken beside them, its gemstone dark.

"Well," the young mistress said shakily, "that was... educational."

Old Master Zhao rushed forward, torn between reprimand and relief. Aze helped Zhao Xue up, their hands lingering a moment too long. Across the crowd, Guan Yu exchanged knowing looks with his companions. This competition's outcome had become... complicated.
