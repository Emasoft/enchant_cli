Chapter 1689: Farewell to School

Meng Feilong and his companion gaped at Guan Yu, scarcely believing their eyes. From several kilometers away, a golden light no thicker than a bamboo chopstick had reduced that massive boulder to dust. What unimaginable power did this represent?

Suddenly, Meng Feilong's vision blurred. Guan Yu's figure, standing a dozen meters away, seemed to flicker before extending his left hand. Resting in his palm was a walnut-sized stone. With a faint smile, Guan Yu tossed it toward Meng Feilong. "This fragment was blasted from the mountaintop. See if it matches!"

Meng Feilong instinctively caught the stone, only to let out a startled yelp and hurl it away. The rock flew toward Yu Zhengchun, who likewise caught it reflexively before crying out and flinging it aside.

Du Xiaojuan and Ouyang Yihan watched the two men act like foolish children, alternately catching and discarding the stone. Though unclear about the cause, they sensed Guan Yu's involvement.

Clutching their scorched hands, Meng Feilong and Yu Zhengchun howled like slaughtered pigs. The discarded stone now emitted black smoke, igniting surrounding weeds. Despite the lush summer foliage, the vegetation burned fiercely—testament to the stone's searing heat. Moments later, the two men reluctantly opened their blistered palms, revealing flesh charred to ash and exposed finger bones gleaming white.

Guan Yu snorted coldly. "Consider this a minor lesson. Should you ever resume wicked deeds next time, your skulls will burn instead! I'm no officer to imprison you. My method is simpler—execution!"

With a flick of his wrist, cooling energy flowed into the men's injuries. Before their astonished eyes, their ravaged hands healed completely. The mysterious energy then surged into their dantians.

"These are strands of spiritual qi from my cultivation—seeds that shall grow through dedicated practice," Guan Yu declared sternly. "But harbor treachery, and these seeds will detonate. The shattered cliff foreshadows your fate!"

The display of power transcended the witnesses' comprehension. Though Du Xiaojuan and Ouyang Yihan had anticipated Guan Yu's strength, this godlike prowess surpassed even cinematic depictions of immortals.

Remembering Guan Yu's earlier claim of divinity, Yu Zhengchun collapsed to his knees. "You entered the Divine Relic and ascended! You're a Martial God now! Henceforth, I shall worship you utterly—public or private. Should I ever betray you, may my corpse rot unburied!"

Not to be outdone, Meng Feilong kowtowed frantically. "Martial God! Henceforth, you are our master!"

Such abject submission mirrored historical precedents—arrogant minds confronted with the inexplicable often seek deities. As they prostrated themselves, Guan Yu sensed translucent wisps of energy flow from them into his consciousness. Though unfamiliar, the energy felt harmless.

True to his word, Guan Yu imprinted the Righteous Qi Art's cultivation method into the two men. Designed to reform criminals' nature, this technique might temper their vicious dispositions.

Though Yu Zhengchun's matter concluded, the Ouyang family's crisis persisted. Before departing, Ouyang Yihan pleaded repeatedly for Guan Yu's intervention until Du Xiaojuan teased: "If you're so worried, pledge yourself to him! Stick by his side—hit him if he slacks!"

"Would... would that work?" Ouyang Yihan nibbled her lip.

Exasperated, Guan Yu swept both women into his arms. Activating Minor Teleportation, he deposited Ouyang Yihan outside his villa.

"Relax," he assured her. "I've sent those two back to military authorities and will personally contact Dragon Group. They'll grant your family respite. When I visit the capital tomorrow, I'll resolve this permanently. But tell your father—have the factories replicate the Eastern Isles' weapons immediately. Even approximations may suffice. Only through matching or surpassing their arsenal will your crisis end."

Witnessing his divine power, Ouyang Yihan now revered Guan Yu utterly. Had he demanded her hand, she'd have complied without hesitation. She vowed to commence replication at once.

After accompanying Du Xiaojuan through Y City, Guan Yu returned to Mingyang High at three PM. Delivering her to Principal Liu Shilei's office, he prepared for class.

Du Xiaojuan clung to him. "School ends in one period! Why attend now?"

Their amorous antics in the principal's office provoked Liu Shilei to slam the door. "Control yourselves! I'm still principal here!"

Undeterred, Du Xiaojuan demanded kisses until Guan Yu protested: "I must go—matters multiply daily. I plan to leave school, but wish to bid farewell."

Liu Shilei snorted. "Farewells? Or lingering attachments to Sun Xiaoya?"

Unabashed, Guan Yu replied: "Of course! I've yet to cure Auntie Sun's illness. Departing without closure would be dishonorable."

Du Xiaojuan pummeled his chest. "'Auntie Sun' now? Confess! Are you involved with her? Who's better—her, us, or Ouyang Yihan?"

"Neither relationship has progressed that far!" Guan Yu cried. "How compare?"

His words kindled fury. "So you plan to eventually?"

Four feminine hands assaulted sensitive areas...

Chapter 1690: Warmth Amidst Chaos

Extricating himself breathlessly, Guan宇 fled Liu Shilei's office. Passing the staff room, secretary Zhu Qianqian gaped at his disheveled state and flushed face—had this student assaulted the principal? Yet without summons, she dared not intervene.

The final period's自习课 (self-study) at Mingyang High resembled recess—students嬉笑玩闹 (frolicked boisterously). Among高一六班's (Class 6, Grade 1) students, only Xu Ying studied diligently, embodying Madame Curie's focus amidst chaos.

Guan Yu slid beside Xu Ying, observing her undisturbed concentration. "This girl's commendable—privileged yet unspoiled. Yang Lin's improved too—studying earnestly, abandoning delinquent ties. Should visit his father soon—cure his ailment and shield them from Wang Jun's oppression."

Noticing Guan Yu, Yang Lin approached: "Boss, what kept you today?" He'd realized Guan宇 transcended ordinary students. Initially assuming Guan Yu sought school dominance after crippling Wang Jun, Yang Lin now saw broader ambitions—consorting with校外 (off-campus) adults of stature.

"Dealt with some arrogant folks today," Guan Yu replied casually, omitting that said "folks" were two of China's three top变异人 (mutants).

Xu Ying finally noticed Guan Yu, slapping his forehead with a textbook. "Guan Yu! I thought you differed from Yang Lin's hoodlum friends! Skipping school to gallivant—which girl did you chase today?"

Gritting teeth, Guan Yu endured the indignity—no adversary dared strike thus! Yet the gesture evoked nostalgic warmth. His attempted quiet student life kept disrupted by escalating events.

Raising hands in surrender, Guan Yu pleaded: "I had urgent business—cleared with Teacher Sun!"

Xu Ying struck again. "She said 'family guests'! Are you a child awaiting treats? I'll have you清洁值日 (clean duties) for a week!"

Yang Lin guffawed. "Xu Ying, smitten with Guan Yu? Need matchmaking?"

Crimson-faced, Xu Ying hurled books. "Smitten your head! We're desk mates—no intermediaries needed!"

Her stammer betrayed fluttering心跳 (heartbeats). Since witnessing Guan Yu defeat Wang Jun's pseudo-superhuman lackeys, the hero archetype had rooted in her少女心 (maiden's heart).

Perceiving her thoughts, Guan Yu teased: "Not bad—pretty face, decent figure, perky rear, slim waist... just needs fuller breasts. Maybe in few years..."

Yang Lin roared laughter—even Meng Fancheng and Wang Jun dared not jest thus!

Enraged, Xu Ying twisted Guan Yu's chest. "Take that back!"

"Mercy! You'll tear nipples off!"

Amidst the commotion, Guan宇 spotted Sun Xiaoya's silhouette at the door...

Chapter 1691: Bu Shiren's Mutation

Sun Xiaoya's empty office reflected Mingyang's lax final period—faculty often left early. The elite school's privileged students and well-connected teachers maintained traditions unchanged by Principal Liu's tenure.

Advancing on the flustered teacher, Guan Yu grinned. "Seeking me, Teacher Sun? Reward for attending class post-leave?"

Sun Xiaoya retreated, arms crossed protectively. "This is the office! Someone might—"

"I merely seek a kiss," Guan Yu countered, offering his cheek.

Blushing crimson, Sun Xiaoya pecked his face—but Guan Yu yanked her into an embrace. As their lips neared, the door crashed open.

"Stop!" roared Bu Shiren, face contorted with rage. Humiliated by prior defeat and convinced Sun Xiaoya would spurn him forever, the Vice-Governor's son had stewed in resentment. Never considering romantic rivals, he'd neglected investigating Guan Yu—who in M Province could surpass his status?
