Xue Jing obediently nodded, feeling genuinely hungry as she sat by the small table. Glancing up at Shuangshuang, she teased, “Shuangshuang, I’m eating here while you can’t. Aren’t you craving it?”

“Not at all! Though the doctor won’t let me eat, I’m not hungry—just thirsty. If only he’d let me drink water, I’d be so grateful,” Shuangshuang replied playfully.

Seeing her in good spirits, Guan Yu felt relieved, assuming the IV nutrients kept her hunger at bay. He had already arranged for her mother and Meimei to be brought over, as Shuangshuang couldn’t move and needed her aunt nearby.

“Big Brother, this is all my fault,” Shuangshuang said remorsefully. “I insisted on going out, causing this mess. Thank goodness you’re both safe, or I’d never forgive myself.”

Guan Yu smiled. “Don’t talk nonsense. I’m perfectly fine, and you saved both me and Jingjing. If anything, I should thank you. Those people would’ve come for me regardless. I’m the one who dragged you into danger.”

Shuangshuang still blamed herself. “But if I hadn’t asked to go out, you wouldn’t have been in that area. They wouldn’t have found you…”

Guan Yu and Xue Jing had let their guard down the previous night, too caught up in fun to notice they were being tailed. Normally vigilant, they’d missed the signs of danger.

“It’s not your fault. Once you recover, I’ll take you on a trip somewhere. Deal?” Guan Yu offered.

“Yes! You promise?” Shuangshuang’s eyes lit up.

“Of course. But first, focus on healing.”

“I’ll get better fast!” she declared cheerfully.

Though out of danger, Shuangshuang needed rest. When Meimei arrived with their aunt, Guan Yu stood apologetically. “I’m sorry I didn’t protect her.”

“Don’t blame yourself,” the aunt replied. “This girl’s always causing trouble. I should scold her!”

Xue Jing interjected, “Shuangshuang saved our lives. She’s our hero. We’re the ones who owe apologies.”

“Really? My daughter did something useful?” The aunt moved to Shuangshuang’s bedside, tears streaming as mother and daughter embraced, Meimei weeping beside them.

Guan Yu and Xue Jing stood awkwardly until Shuangshuang broke the silence. “Mom, I’m fine! Jing姐姐 worked hard to save me. The doctor says I’ll recover in days.”

The aunt dabbed her eyes. “Thank heavens. If you’d harmed Guan Yu, I’d never forgive you.” Her stern tone belied her relief.

“I bravely protected Jing姐姐! Ask them!” Shuangshuang boasted.

Meimei turned to Guan Yu. “What exactly happened?”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu explained, “Enemies targeted me. Shuangshuang spotted the danger first, warned us, and took a knife meant for Xue Jing.”

“Someone tried to stab you?!” The aunt paled. “How terrifying!”

Xue Jing added, “Shuangshuang’s courage saved us. We owe her everything.”

“Your world is beyond me,” the aunt sighed. “But my foolish girl did something noble. I’m proud.” She stroked Shuangshuang’s hair affectionately.

Guan Yu arranged breakfast for the newcomers. As they ate, he suggested, “Auntie, why not stay here with Shuangshuang? The room is spacious.”

She agreed gratefully. Xue Jing mentioned hiring a tutor for Shuangshuang’s studies, overcoming the aunt’s initial reluctance about costs. “She’s our savior. Money means nothing,” Xue Jing insisted.

“Fine,” the aunt conceded. “But this girl claims she’s a genius who doesn’t need help!”

Shuangshuang pouted. “I can self-study!”

“Tutors are non-negotiable,” Guan Yu declared, silencing her protests.

As belongings were fetched, Xue Jing quietly asked Meimei about her suitor Yinzhong. Blushing, Meimei admitted, “We’re taking it slow.”

“Look at her, lovesick!” Shuangshuang teased from bed.

“Quiet, you!” Meimei shot back. “I hope your scar stays huge!”

“Big Brother promised me scar-free surgery!” Shuangshuang retorted smugly.

Their squabble halted when Ling’er entered with fruit. “Why wasn’t I told?” she chided gently.

After greetings, Ling’er noticed the bandages. “What happened?”

“She shielded me from attackers,” Xue Jing summarized.

“Our little hero!” Ling’er praised.

“See? Even Ling’er姐姐 agrees I’m amazing!” Shuangshuang preened.

Later, Ling’er pulled Guan Yu aside. “Jinhua wants to see you. She’s recovered.”

“I’ll visit soon,” he promised before taking his leave.

As Guan Yu departed, the aunt sighed. “These girls bicker endlessly!”

“But we’re family,” Meimei said, smiling through tears.

In the warmth of the hospital room, bonds of gratitude and love outweighed the lingering shadows of danger.
