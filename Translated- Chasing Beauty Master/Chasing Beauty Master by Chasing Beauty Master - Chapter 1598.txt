But Guan Yu's warning came too late. By the time he shouted, Wang Xiaorong had already plucked the flower, her hand jerking back in alarm at his sudden cry.

Both froze, realization dawning on Wang Xiaorong—they were in an illusionary realm where disturbing anything could spell disaster. Yet moments passed without incident. After listening intently, Guan Yu began to relax, chiding himself for overreacting.

No sooner had they exhaled than a thunderous rumble erupted behind them. Guan Yu glanced upward and paled. Without hesitation, he seized Wang Xiaorong, hoisted her onto his shoulder, and bolted upward as the ground crumbled beneath them. Stone slabs fractured at the platform's edge, plummeting into the abyss below. Staying put meant certain death once their footing gave way.

With the staircase collapsing into the chasm mere meters ahead, Guan Yu hurled Wang Xiaorong toward the remaining platform. As he threw her, the slab beneath his feet vanished, sending him into free fall.

Wang Xiaorong scrambled to her knees on the platform, screaming his name until her voice cracked. "Guan Yu! GUAN YU!" Only the echoes of falling stones answered. Despair twisted her face as tears cascaded down. "This is all my fault... I'll join you now—"

"Don't you dare!" Guan Yu's voice rang out from below. Clinging to a dagger embedded in the cliffside, he dangled precariously. Wang Xiaorong yanked off her belt and flung it down. With a coordinated heave, she hauled him to safety. He collapsed into her arms as she sobbed into his drenched shirt.

"Enough tears," Guan Yu rasped, still shaken but forcing calm. "I'm here." He recounted his narrow escape—a last-second foothold had allowed him to lodge his blade into the platform's edge. Wang Xiaorong trembled with guilt, but he steadied her. "We'll get out. Just touch nothing now."

Surveying their prison—a lone platform flanked by void—Guan Yu theorized the illusion blended reality and deception. He examined the plucked flower, an ordinary bloom, before tossing it into the supposed abyss. Its endless fall confirmed the chasm's reality. "Trapped," he muttered.

Wang Xiaorong suggested brute force: "If our power surpasses the maze-maker's, we could shatter this illusion." Doubtful but desperate, Guan Yu took her crossbow and fired at the main gate. The bolt struck metal—a hollow clang signaling substance beneath the illusion.

Their attention turned to twin stone steles flanking the entrance. One had shifted when Wang Xiaorong leaned against it earlier. "These might be switches," Guan Yu reasoned. "One opens the gate; the other triggers traps." Wang Xiaorong located a recessed character on the movable stele—a potential trigger.

Paralyzed by choice, they debated. "Let's activate both at once," Guan Yu proposed. "Rush through whichever opens." Wang Xiaorong balked but nodded. As they prepared, she murmured incantations, attempting to divine the correct path through fragmented memories of mystic teachings. When her calculations failed, resolve hardened their faces.

"East and west, life and death—we face them together," Guan Yu said, squeezing her hand. They pressed the hidden mechanisms in unison, bracing for salvation or oblivion.
