Only the members of the Organization were fighting relentlessly. Moreover, nearly all these individuals were cultivators, making short work of the enemy's cannon fodder. Though fewer than a hundred had arrived, combined with Xue Jing and Jones' counterattacks, they swiftly suppressed the opposing forces.

The situation on Guan Yu's side stabilized. Seeing the unfavorable turn, Sun Xu said to the expert beside him, "It seems reinforcements have arrived. This doesn't look good. Since when did Yu Gang's members become such formidable fighters?" From Sun Xu's vantage point, the details were unclear, leading him to mistakenly believe Yu Gang's forces had arrived.

Sun Xu's assumption was unsurprising. In his eyes, Guan Yu could only rely on Yu Gang's members. He remained utterly unaware of the Free Organization's existence.

The mob that had eagerly come to stir trouble at Guan Yu's doorstep initially dominated the situation, overwhelming him. But the arrival of this group abruptly shifted the tide.

Jones and Xue Jing halted their attacks, flanking Guan Yu as they surveyed the battlefield. Xue Jing remarked gloomily, "To think they mobilized so many mercenaries in such a short time. Bill Lin's influence is truly formidable."

Guan Yu chuckled lightly. "Influence? Merely deep pockets. These people are clearly motivated by profit. Without those incentives, they'd have fled long ago."

**Chapter 2651: Black Cloaks**

Jones observed the shifting battlefield, her gaze fixed on one individual's performance. Though the Organization didn't boast an excess of experts, it had its share. Her focus now was on a recent recruit—Lu Suicheng.

This man had been recommended by Jiang Fenju and thoroughly vetted by Jones before joining. His cultivation was profound, and his combat style deviated from conventional methods. His figure flickered across the field like a phantom, leaving afterimages in his wake—a signature of his elusive "Drifting Assault" technique.

His fighting method confounded enemies from the outset, allowing him to ambush opponents with stealth. While such skills excelled in one-on-one combat, his current performance against multiple adversaries remained impressive.

On another front, Ge Yinglai and his hundred-odd men barely managed to hold off the dozens guarding the gate. Both sides had reached another stalemate.

Ge Yinglai dared not press further. In his view, if all five hundred men attacked these few dozen, victory would be assured. But with only a hundred advancing, their numbers proved insufficient.

A sharp pain throbbed in Ge Yinglai's chest—a remnant of his earlier clash. The blow had cowed him into retreat.

The gatekeepers also bore injuries. After all, two fists could not fend off four hands, especially in confined spaces where ambushes from behind were inevitable in such chaos.

Moreover, without Guan Yu's explicit permission, the guards refrained from using their prohibited weapons.

Ge Yinglai roared, "Fuckers! Ganging up on me? Come out and fight me one-on-one if you've got balls!"

His shout drew contemptuous glances not only from Guan Yu's men but even from his own allies.

The lead guard sneered, "You didn't demand single combat when your mob surrounded our two leaders earlier."

"Shut your cowardly mouth!" Ge Yinglai retorted, his face flushing crimson. Unfazed by others' disdain, he retreated to Sun Xu and urged, "It's time to deploy them. Otherwise, we'll lose today."

Sun Xu nodded. Beside him stood several black-cloaked figures shrouded in hoods—mysterious hired assassins from a cultivator organization. Their disguises aimed to conceal their identities while delivering a crippling blow to Guan Yu.

Sun Xu pointed toward Guan Yu. "Your targets are the two women and the man between them. Bill Lin promises great rewards for their deaths."

Guan Yu, still assessing the battlefield, noticed Lu Suicheng's avian-like agility. His movements defied conventional qinggong, launching attacks mid-air without visible leverage.

Jones twirled her crescent blade—a weapon seldom used but now essential for Guan Yu's protection. Her eyes remained fixed on Lu Suicheng as she remarked, "See that man?" Guan Yu nodded. "His cultivation is peculiar. I don't recall encountering him before."

"He joined recently—Lu Suicheng, an eccentric cultivator," Jones explained. "The city's flooded with outsiders drawn by the treasure map rumors. Even sect cultivators gather here."

Guan Yu frowned. "This bodes ill. The situation grows uncontrollable." He worried about the informant leaking the map's existence. Two of the Ten Great Villains—Yingshangu and Feitian Lang—had already visited him. Their disappearance after obtaining the map portended more trouble.

"Look out!" A dart pierced through a Free Organization member before hurtling toward Guan Yu's face.

Jones reacted first, deflecting the projectile with her blade. The clang echoed as the dart vanished into the night.

"Too close…" Xue Jing breathed, shielding Guan Yu. The near-miss left all three shaken. The assassin's skill was evident—launching such a strike undetected in darkness required formidable cultivation.

As they steadied themselves, four black-cloaked figures emerged from the crowd. One wielded a compact crossbow—the source of the lethal dart. Their auras radiated danger.

"These four are strong. Be cautious," Guan Yu warned.

Jones stepped forward. "I'll engage them. Xue Jing, guard him."

**Chapter 2652: One Against Four**

Xue Jing agreed without hesitation. Protecting Guan Yu took precedence.

Guan Yu added, "Lu Suicheng could assist." Jones acknowledged but charged ahead, determined to draw the fight away.

Despite being outnumbered, Jones held her ground. The four attackers struggled to gain advantage, their coordinated efforts thwarted by her superior cultivation.

Guan Yu marveled at Jones' growth. The once-innocent foreign girl had transformed into a formidable cultivator, her progress astonishing. Her unwavering loyalty and silent sacrifices weighed on him—he owed her more than he'd ever acknowledged.

The assassins inched the battle toward Guan Yu. Jones fought to maintain distance, wary of hidden weapons. But four opponents proved difficult to contain.

"Let's retreat further," Xue Jing urged. Guan Yu agreed, but vehicles blocked their path—hastily parked during the initial chaos.

Perched on a rock for better view, Sun Xu rallied his men: "Brothers! Our future wealth hinges on today! Charge at Guan Yu—crush him!"

The shout reignited his forces' morale. Free Organization members faltered under renewed assault, several trampled in the frenzy.

Xue Jing tensed, torn between aiding allies and protecting Guan Yu.

Footsteps approached. A voice called, "Brother Guan! Forgive our tardiness!" Shen Sheng, Big Beard, and Xiao Bai arrived.

"Perfect timing," Guan Yu greeted.

Big Beard roared, "Taste my club!" He joined Jones' fray, his massive weapon clashing with a foe's blade in a shower of sparks. The struck assassin flew back but landed deftly, glaring through his hood.

Shen Sheng and Xiao Bai dove into the melee. "Protect Brother Guan!" Shen Sheng's voice trailed as they engaged.

Big Beard wreaked havoc through the crowd, his club disabling limbs without lethal force. The tide turned—assailants recoiled, demoralized by his onslaught.

**Chapter 2653: Relentless Assault**

Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai paled. "We need backup!" Sun Xu dialed urgently. "Yaozi! Bring reinforcements!"

They hadn't staked everything on initial forces. Bill Lin, though obsessed with Qiaoyuan District's women, had orchestrated this probe of Guan Yu's strength from abroad.

The five hundred mobsters and four assassins were mere pawns. Sun Xu, distrusting Bill Lin's assessment, had secretly hired the Yuejing Organization—a hundred-strong cultivator group—with Fang Su's funds and Feng少爺's covert aid.

Three million bought this insurance. Now, as Guan Yu's reinforcements overwhelmed them, desperation demanded their deployment.

The battlefield raged—Big Beard's club, Shen Sheng's precision, and Jones' crescent blade carving through opposition. Yet shadows loomed—the Yuejing cultivators approached, their arrival threatening to escalate the conflict beyond control.
