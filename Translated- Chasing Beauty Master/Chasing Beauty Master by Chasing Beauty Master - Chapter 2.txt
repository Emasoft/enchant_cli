As Professor Wang angrily slammed the table and stood up with a confrontational stance, Guan Yu casually rose to his feet, rolling up his sleeves and adopting a combative posture of his own.

"Alright, alright... Professor Wang, what's all this about! He's just a student, young and impulsive with his words. Why get so worked up over him?"

Seeing Guan Yu's defiant posture, the slender Professor Wang reluctantly sat back down with a huff.

Guan Yu smirked inwardly as he too resumed his seat. When it came to verbal sparring, few could match him, and as for physical confrontation—given the professor's frail build—he stood no chance whatsoever!

The elderly man seated at the center finally looked up after prolonged silence, studying Guan Yu intently before turning to whisper with the beautiful female teacher. After a brief exchange, he nodded.

"Very well, Student Guan Yu—you're admitted."

"Principal, you can't—" The provoked Professor Wang paled, protesting vehemently.

"Enough. I agree with Professor Liu's assessment. Moreover, Guan Yu has applied for the program she oversees. As his prospective advisor sees no issue, the matter is settled."

"But Professor Liu, how could you accept such a student? He—"

Guan Yu blinked in disbelief. He'd fully expected to storm out of this disastrous interview, yet unexpectedly, this stunning teacher had intervened yet again to secure his admission.

As Guan Yu turned to leave, however, the beauty's parting words nearly made him trip over his own feet:

"Professor Wang, please don't take it to heart. Actually... Guan Yu is my younger brother."

Guan Yu scratched his head dumbfounded. Holy hell—was this woman his future cousin-in-law? And here he'd been shamelessly complimenting her figure and curves earlier! Mortification burned through him.

Returning to the classroom, Guan Yu slumped by the window, utterly lost.

When the last interviewees departed, leaving him alone, Liu Shilei glided into the room with light footsteps.

"Guan Yu? I'm Liu Shilei. Why didn't you call before coming for the interview?" she asked softly, lips curving.

Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly, stammering, "Sis... sister-in-law, I—I lost my phone!"

He couldn't bear to admit the humiliating truth—that a grown man like him had been swindled out of his mobile.

"Careless boy! If not for your distinctive name, I might not have recognized you." Liu Shilei's cheeks flushed pink as she glanced away uncomfortably.

"Sister-in-law, I had no idea you were family! Otherwise I'd never have—"

"Enough of that. Let's go—grab your luggage." Cutting him off, she briskly ushered him out.

Trailing behind, Guan Yu's gaze involuntarily drifted to the alluring sway beneath her pencil skirt, the rhythmic click of her heels accentuating each hypnotic movement.

He mentally chastised himself—this was his future cousin's wife! Forcing his eyes away, he quickened his pace when she called:

"Dragging your feet? Is the luggage heavy?"

"No, not at all!" He caught up, walking beside her.

Stealing glances at her porcelain profile—dewy skin, fluttering lashes, flowing hair—he felt caught in a dream.

"New student registration starts the day after tomorrow. You'll stay at the school guesthouse until dorm assignments begin. Leave your bags in my office for now." Her tone remained detached as they walked.

"Thanks, sis—" Guan Yu caught himself, swallowing the familial address.

"Call me Sister Liu. Your cousin and I... well, don't use 'sister-in-law' yet."

He shrugged. Unmarried for now, but inevitable eventually.

"Rascal, you infuriated Professor Wang today. The principal nearly expelled you..."

"I know it was your doing—thank you, sis!" Guan Yu sighed, lightly slapping his own cheek at the habitual slip.

"Just 'Sister' suffices!" She shot him an exasperated look. "Once term starts, address me as Professor Liu in front of others."

"Understood." He nodded vigorously.

"Control that temper—just like your cousin. Stay low-profile." She pursed her lips. "Many students here come from influential families. Avoid trouble."

"Don't worry, Sis. I'm not a kid anymore." He thumped his chest confidently.

"Oh really?" Her sudden laughter sent his pulse racing. "The boy who rolled up sleeves to fight during an interview claims maturity?"

"Sis, I swear! That professor was leering at you! The way he—"

"Enough nonsense!" She bit her lip, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"Just say the word if anyone harasses you. I'll punch their lights out!" He brandished a fist dramatically.

Liu Shilei arched an eyebrow. "Weren't you just boasting about being responsible? Now it's vigilante justice?"

"Different matters! I won't start fights, but no one touches my family." His expression hardened.

Watching his earnestness, she smiled privately. Family? Her relationship with his cousin wasn't what he imagined.

Youthful bravado—he hadn't yet learned how powerless ordinary people could be against life's cruelties...

**Chapter 4: The Uninhibited Girl**

Liu Shilei's faculty dorm was spartan—twin mattresses stacked by the window, neat bedding, a computer atop the desk. Clotheslines strung above displayed knotted stockings and... Guan Yu averted his eyes from the dangling lace undergarments.

"Sit. Leave the suitcase by the door." She kicked off her heels, settling on the mattress.

As Guan Yu perched awkwardly, she fetched water. His gaze kept straying to the intimate garments overhead.

"Why choose our arts school?" she asked. "Dreaming of stardom?"

He grimaced, recalling friends' laughter when he'd announced his quest for true love. Their mockery had died into pensive silence—youthful idealism lingering beneath cynicism.

Now here he stood, those romantic hopes crumbling...

The ringing phone shattered the heavy silence.

After brief exchanges, Liu Shilei rose. "Stay here. I'll handle something and return to cook dinner."

"No need, I'll eat out—" His protest died as his gaze snagged on her stockinged feet—petite, translucent toes triggering sudden dryness in his throat.

"Outside food's unsanitary. Stay put." With that, she departed.

Left alone, Guan Yu's eyes betrayed him, lingering on the delicate lingerie.

*Knock knock knock*

Before he could react, the door burst open. A melodious voice trilled: "Shilei! I'm back to keep you company—"

Guan Yu froze as a stranger barged in.

**Chapter 5: Let Me Explain, Sis!**

Panicked, Guan Yu ducked into the bathroom—only to freeze at the sound of approaching heels.

The woman entered humming, washing garments mere feet from his hiding spot. Guan Yu prayed for invisibility.

Post-crisis, as he crept out, his eyes widened at the abandoned lingerie. A smirk formed—the owner must be quite adventurous.

Then horror struck.

In the last stall sat a wide-eyed woman mid-relief, black skirt pooled at her waist, creamy thighs framing dark curls.

Time suspended.

Three heartbeats later, Guan Yu fled like Olympian sprinter, door slamming behind him.

"PERVERT!" The scream chased him.

Fists pounded his door: "I saw you enter Shilei's room! Open up or I call police!"

"Misunderstanding!" he croaked through the wood, sweat-drenched.

As he cracked the door, a broom handle swung at his head. Disarming it, he faced his accuser—a stunning young woman now barricaded in her own room.

Panting against his door, Guan Yu's mind raced. How to explain this catastrophe?
