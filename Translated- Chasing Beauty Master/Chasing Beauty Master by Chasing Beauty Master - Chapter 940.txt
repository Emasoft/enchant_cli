“It was partly the mother’s carelessness that she only realized something was wrong when her daughter screamed. Fortunately, it happened to be a bus stop. After getting off there, the man tried to flee but was desperately grabbed by the woman. Once bystanders gathered, he had no escape.

When the woman threatened to call the police and demanded an explanation, the despicable man even had the audacity to suggest ‘jointly supporting’ both the mother and daughter—a truly outrageous proposition.

Finding nothing more worth watching, Guan Yu lost interest. After pulling Lan Yu (Blue Jade) through the crowd, he arrived just as Second to Wolf reached the spot.

Easily locating Guan Yu, Second to Wolf was surprised to find him accompanied by a beautiful young girl.

After introductions, Second to Wolf learned her name was Lan Yu. Though aware of Guan Yu’s many romantic entanglements, he couldn’t help feeling critical this time.

After all, Guan Yu had come to take Yingzi (Cherry Child) away. Was it appropriate to bring another woman along for such a task?

Once Guan Yu and Lan Yu entered the car, Guan Yu noticed Second to Wolf’s disapproval and explained, “Ah, after the disaster in the West, assassins have already infiltrated China. I was ambushed just before coming here.”

Second to Wolf grew serious. “That severe? They’re truly targeting you.”

“Yes. Now, whenever I go out, my sisters insist Xue Jing accompanies me for protection. I barely managed to slip away this time, intending to come alone. But I ran into Lan Yu at the airport.

She was traveling solo and decided to join me. My family doesn’t know I’m here—if they find out, I’ll be punished or even sent back to the corporation.”

Second to Wolf accepted this explanation. Given Guan Yu’s reputation, bringing one more woman hardly mattered. Yingzi already knew of his ways.

After over an hour’s drive, they neared Second to Wolf’s home along a straight highway. Lan Yu marveled at the foreign scenery, eagerly questioning Second to Wolf about everything.

Approaching, Guan Yu spotted A Cai (Vegetable) waiting roadside alongside a girl in red—undoubtedly Yingzi, though her face felt only vaguely familiar.

Up close, Yingzi trembled nervously, her translucent, porcelain-like skin seeming almost liquid—so delicate one feared touching it might mar its perfection.

As Guan Yu stepped out, A Cai greeted cheerfully, “Big Brother, you’re here!” He’d been waiting excitedly with Yingzi since Second to Wolf left.

Guan Yu acknowledged him briefly before turning to Yingzi. Overwhelmed, she stood shaking, countless words trapped in her throat.

Dressed in red, her beauty was peerless. Guan Yu felt a flicker of pride—his past self had excellent taste.

Too nervous to meet his gaze, Yingzi kept her head bowed until Second to Wolf gently urged, “Yingzi, the man you’ve longed for is here. Be brave.”

**Chapter 2404: Reimbursing Food Expenses**

The words broke her composure. Tears spilled as Yingzi muffled sobs into her hands. Second to Wolf embraced her, soothing, “Don’t cry now—you’ll ruin your looks, and Guan Yu might not like you!”

The threat worked instantly. Wiping tears, Yingzi bowed slightly. “Hello, Guan Yu. We’ve finally met.”

“Quick, invite everyone inside,” Second to Wolf prompted. “Standing outside isn’t hospitable.”

Yingzi gestured gracefully. “Please, come in.”

The atmosphere felt awkwardly reminiscent of a blind date. With no memory of Yingzi, Guan Yu struggled for words.

After seating everyone, Second to Wolf introduced Lan Yu and A Cai. “We need to ease this tension,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Indeed! Sister Yingzi’s nervousness is contagious,” Lan Yu giggled.

A Cai envied Guan Yu’s knack for attracting beauties. Meanwhile, Yingzi had spent all day preparing dishes that Second to Wolf knew were... ambitious.

“Let’s eat!” A Cai urged. “Yingzi slaved over this feast—even stopped me from sipping cold soup!”

“These are for Guan Yu,” Yingzi chided. “Make your own food if you’re hungry!”

As she reheated dishes, Second to Wolf winced inwardly. Guan Yu, accustomed to gourmet cooking, might struggle with her culinary skills.

The meal proved surprisingly edible—Yingzi had wisely minimized seasonings. While Guan Yu and Lan Yu nibbled, A Cai and Second to Wolf devoured portions.

“Yingzi’s cooking improved miraculously!” Second to Wolf joked. “Must be love.”

“I’ve learned clever tricks,” Yingzi smiled.

Between mouthfuls, Second to Wolf complained, “A Cai eats enough to bankrupt me! Shouldn’t you cover his food expenses?”

“You?” Guan Yu scoffed. “A single mission earns you billions! Besides, I gifted you a talented disciple—be grateful! Or I’ll take them both away.”

**Chapter 2405: Inscrutable Symbols**

“Don’t!” Second to Wolf panicked. “I’ve invested too much in training A Cai! And I’m poor—Yingzi hoards my mission earnings!”

“To stop your gambling!” Yingzi retorted. “I’ll keep funding myself to match Guan Yu’s wealthy women.”

“You’ve enough for two lifetimes!” Second to Wolf argued before relenting.

Changing topics, Yingzi produced a gleaming golden dagger. “This is what you entrusted me. It might help lift your seal.”

Examining the intricate demonic runes, Guan Yu winced as sudden pain lanced his skull. The symbols remained cryptic.

“Perhaps it’s demonic script,” he mused. “Understanding it may unlock the seal.”

“Then there’s hope,” Second to Wolf encouraged.

“Demons? Like in stories?” Lan Yu gasped, unfamiliar with supernatural realms.

As Guan Yu pondered the arcane blade, its secrets lingered—a puzzle demanding patience and ancient wisdom to solve.
