Simultaneously, two powerful skills came crashing towards Guan Yu's position. Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu endured the damage and unleashed two consecutive hand chops, but the result left him stunned.

The remaining two Liu Dians vanished into black smoke upon being struck, their main body disappearing entirely. Liu Dian's figure then materialized behind Guan Yu, a glowing energy coalescing in his palm as he swung toward Guan Yu's back.

Guan Yu inwardly cursed. He teleported away just as his shield shuddered under a heavy blow. Fortunately, the attack posed no real threat.

When Guan Yu turned, three Liu Dians now stood before him. Unfazed, Guan Yu calmly analyzed his opponent's weaknesses. Though Liu Dian's cultivation was inferior—evident from his earlier ambush—his vexing tactics made him a tricky foe.

"Fine. If you want to play with clones, I'll smash every last one," Guan Yu muttered. He charged forward again, shield raised against Liu Dian's frenzied onslaught. With a sudden burst of force, he sent all three clones flying. As before, they dissolved into black smoke.

Anticipating danger, Guan Yu smirked and crossed his arms, roaring, "**Explode…**"

*Boom!* His eggshell-like shield detonated. Behind him, Liu Dian slammed into a steel wall, face pallid and blood spewing from his lips. The blast had hurled him across the arena.

The crowd held its breath. Many secretly hoped Liu Dian would mutate like previous berserkers, prolonging the thrill. But Liu Dian crumpled to the ground, vomiting blood before losing consciousness. Guan Yu frowned. *Did my shield's explosion really pack that much force? Or is his defense just pathetic?*

The referee rose reluctantly. "This round's victor is Guan Yu of Kaihuang Academy!" Picking up a document, he announced, "The fourth A-City Inter-Academy Taekwondo Championship concludes with Kaihuang Academy defeating LanZhe Academy! The title of Champion goes to Kaihuang! Let us also congratulate LanZhe Academy as this year's Runner-Up!"

The principal of LanZhe Academy sighed deeply. Losing the championship paled against his greater loss—a four-million bet on his school's victory, now vanished. LanZhe's team carried Liu Dian off to the hospital.

Guan Yu shook his head. *Hospitals can't truly heal cultivators. Why do they bother? Internal energy circulation is what he needs. Do they think hospitals have healing masters?*

The crowd erupted in applause, chanting Guan Yu's name. Among them stood an ethereal beauty, her lips curved in pride yet conflicted. She rejoiced in his victory but yearned for him to remain an ordinary man...

Returning to Kaihuang's rest area, the principal beamed. "Guan Yu, you've brought glory to our academy. This is your reward." He handed Guan Yu an envelope containing 20,000 yuan—modest but motivational. Wang Hu, Zhang Han, and Chen Tianxiao received similar.

The award ceremony proceeded swiftly. The previous day's third-place playoff had already crowned Linyuan Academy over Shiji Yuanglin Academy. Champions received a grand trophy and individual medals.

With the event concluded, Guan Yu left the stadium. Glory belonged to the school; few would remember the fighters. He skipped the afternoon individual matches, returning to his hotel before departing for A-City.

Finally free of Zhang Han's chatter—now seated with Yang Conghan—Guan Yu pondered the surge of cultivators. *So many gathered here… In the past, the entire world scarcely had this many. What's changed?*

Unbeknownst to him, East Island's experiments in replicating异能者 (superhumans) had leaked to China. Entrepreneurs sold bootleg methods, producing passable results. Authorities scrambled to control this unchecked growth, fearing uncontrollable power.

China's special departments already nurtured compliant superhumans while suppressing rogue elements. Earlier, they'd developed anti-mutant weapons—like the missile that once struck Guan Yu. Successful against third-class mutants (crippling them), second-class (temporary incapacitation), and first-class (30% power reduction), these arms now curbed criminal mutants effectively.

But Guan Yu remembered none of this.

Returning to A-City at noon, the group ate briefly before Wei Hongwei rushed off to meet his new flame, Qian Yaoyao, who'd called repeatedly about afternoon shopping.

With Zhang Han coaxed back to the Yang residence by Yang Conghan, Guan Yu, Xue Jing, and Ah Mei returned to Xue Jing's Qiaoyuan District villa. As Guan Yu snacked on freshly washed fruits, his phone rang.

"Wei Hongwei?" Guan Yu answered.

"Brother Guan! Save Yaoyao! They took her!" Wei Hongwei's panicked voice crackled.

"Slow down. Where are you?" Guan Yu strode to the courtyard, settling into the Da Hang.

"Friendship Mall! Yaoyao bumped into some guy. He called twenty thugs! They dragged her away! Hurry!"

"Stall them. I'm coming." Guan Yu floored the accelerator, the Da Hang shooting forward like an arrow.

*Dragons and tigers lurk in A-City's shadows. Best tread carefully.*

At the mall, Wei Hongwei stood trembling. "They… they took her! Said if we want her back, *you* must call this number!" He thrust a paper at Guan Yu.

"A trap for me? Why target *his* girl?" Guan Yu dialed.

A woman's voice answered. "Guan Yu? Don’t worry—your friend’s unharmed. I merely wish to meet. Come alone to Anping Street's west end."

After instructing Wei Hongwei to wait, Guan Yu sped to the desolate construction zone on A-City's outskirts. The tallest half-built tower loomed ahead. Inside, a ring of men surrounded Qian Yaoyao.

A stunning woman emerged—crimson hair cascading to her waist, figure lethal in tight combat gear. "Release her," she ordered.

The men parted. Qian Yaoyao sprinted to Guan Yu. "They kidnapped me for no reason!"

"Stay close," Guan Yu reassured.

The woman approached. "Forgive the crude invitation, Guan Yu. I meant no harm. I’m Meiyu."

Guan Yu spotted Jiang Fenju—the recruiter from yesterday's "Free Organization"—among her entourage.

Meiyu continued, "Join us. We can restore your memories."

Guan Yu paused. Though intrigued, he shook his head. "My memories will return in time. Threaten my people again, and consequences will follow."

"Wait!" Meiyu blocked his path. "At least let us be friends."

"**Hòu huì wú qī** (Farewell forever)." Guan Yu led Qian Yaoyao away, ignoring her plea.

Jiang Fenju watched, baffled by Meiyu's uncharacteristic persistence. The ice queen who shunned men now melted for Guan Yu?

Yet Guan Yu vanished into the distance, leaving Meiyu staring after him, her crimson hair fluttering in the wind.
