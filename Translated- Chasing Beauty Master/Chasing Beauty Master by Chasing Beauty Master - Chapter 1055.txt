**Chapter 2697: Will Not Stand Idly By**

Ma Tong frowned in confusion. “That doesn’t add up. I’ve had some dealings with Patriarch Yang over the years. He even reserved a seat for me at the Yang family’s auction. If Guan Yu is truly the Yang family’s son-in-law, why would he come wreck my establishment?”

Bill Lin’s heart sank. *Shit. I didn’t know Ma Tong had ties to the Yang family. If this gets clarified, our scheme today will unravel.* He shot Fang Su a pointed look, silently urging him to fix this.

Fang Su’s eyes flickered as he spun an explanation. “It’s simple. Guan Yu acts without regard for consequences. Your new venture here threatens his profits—it’s cutting into his territory. A reckless man like him would smash anything in his way. Why would he care about formalities?”

“If that’s the case,” Ma Tong mused, “I should seek Patriarch Yang’s counsel. He owes me an explanation.”

*Fuck!* Fang Su cursed inwardly. *This is spiraling out of control. If Ma Tong approaches the Yangs, we’re finished. Damn Bill Lin and his big mouth—why reveal Guan Yu’s status?* Aloud, he pressed, “You misunderstand Guan Yu’s nature. Even if you confront Patriarch Yang, it’ll achieve nothing. The Yangs have no control over him. Take our past clashes—they’ve never lifted a finger to aid him.”

“Exactly,” Bill Lin chimed in. “His title as their son-in-law is nominal. The Yangs stay out of his affairs. Dragging them into this would only cause unnecessary trouble.”

Fang Su nodded. “Guan Yu earned that title by saving Patriarch Yang’s life once. The Yangs publicly acknowledged him out of gratitude and face-saving decorum. In truth, he rarely interacts with them.”

Their relentless efforts to sever Guan Yu’s perceived ties to the Yangs gradually swayed Ma Tong. “So these ‘powerful connections’ of his are mere illusions?” Ma Tong murmured.

Bill Lin clapped Ma Tong’s shoulder. “Essentially. But don’t worry—I won’t stand by after tonight’s disgrace. I’ll back you fully against Guan Yu.”

Bolstered by Bill Lin’s pledge, Ma Tong’s defiance hardened. *You think you’re untouchable, Guan Yu? Well, I’m no pushover either. Let’s see how your three heads and six arms fare against me!*

Fang Su interjected cautiously, “Rash action will only backfire. Guan Yu’s cunning and surrounded by experts. We need a meticulous plan.”

Ma Tong scoffed. “I refuse to believe he’s invincible. If he dares cross me, I’ll break him like a twig!” He bellowed for his assistant. “Where are the men I called? They’d better hurry!”

The limping assistant rushed over. “Boss, Lie Bao (Leopard) and Ju Niu (Giant Bull) have gathered two hundred men. More are assembling.”

Bill Lin remained unmoved, but Fang Su hid his surprise. *Ma Tong’s influence is real—mobilizing so many so quickly…*

“Have them report here,” Ma Tong ordered. “We’ll storm Guan Yu’s hideout tonight. Any intel on his location?”

Bill Lin cut in. “We know his habits best. I can lead you to his doorstep, but…” He trailed off meaningfully.

“Speak plainly,” Ma Tong demanded.

“Charging in blindly will get your men slaughtered without scratching Guan Yu. We’ve tried ambushes before—he’s always prepared.”

Fang Su added, “Attack recklessly, and half your force won’t return. Revenge requires strategy, not brute force.”

Conflicted but wary, Ma Tong relented. “Fine. We’ll reconvene tomorrow at the Feng family to plan.”

After the conspirators dispersed, a shadow slipped from the ruined casino into a black Mercedes. The Yang family spy dialed Patriarch Yang. “Guan Yu’s men raided Ma Tong’s casino. Bill Lin and Fang Su stopped Ma Tong from retaliating tonight.”

Patriarch Yang’s brow furrowed. “Guan Yu wouldn’t act so crudely. This reeks of framing.” After consulting the family elder, he called Guan Yu directly.

“Heard you’ve been busy wrecking Ma Tong’s new venture,” Patriarch Yang teased when Guan Yu answered.

“What? I’ve done no such thing!”

“Twenty ‘Yu Gang’ members trashed the place. Ma Tong’s gathering forces. Bill Lin convinced him to delay until tomorrow.”

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “Let them scheme. I’ll play along—it’s been dull lately.”

“Just don’t neglect my daughter,” Patriarch Yang chided before hanging up.

Beside Guan Yu, Xue Jing offered an apple. “Trouble again?”

“Bill Lin’s recruiting new pawns.” Guan Yu bit into the fruit. “He thinks attrition will wear me down. Joke’s on him—every attack only weakens *his* side.”

Xue Jing frowned. “But if he keeps finding allies…”

“Then I’ll dismantle them one by one. By the time Bill Lin realizes, he’ll have no pieces left to move.”
