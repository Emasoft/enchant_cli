“Second to the Wolf” pondered for a moment. This truly was an excellent plan. The more powerful the defensive spells stored in Guan Yu’s Imperial Seal, the safer he would be. Naturally, he wholeheartedly supported this idea. “No problem. Leave it to me. After the Six Peaks Assembly concludes, I’ll go to Convergence Peak and fetch you some spirit fruits.”

As the crowd dispersed, Second to the Wolf initially intended to leave but hesitated. Worried that Peak Master Xiang might secretly cause trouble for Guan Yu, he insisted on staying with the young man for protection.

Guan Yu naturally didn’t object. The two were about to retire to Guan Yu’s quarters when Xuan Ming called out, “Guan Yu, wait. I need to speak with you.”

“Master, what is it?” Guan Yu turned and asked.

“Follow me.” Xuan Ming led him through a side passage of the main hall to a small woodshed deep within the compound. The late hour ensured complete privacy in the deserted area.

Xuan Ming inquired, “You expended the defensive spell stored in your Imperial Seal today, correct?”

“Indeed. I had no choice at the time,” Guan Yu replied with a sigh. Using such precious magic against fellow disciples pained him, especially considering how difficult it had been for Elder Jiu to imbue the spell initially.

“Good. I shall help you store a new defensive spell tonight,” Xuan Ming declared. “This protection will prove crucial for your advancement to the top four in the Six Peaks Assembly. Without it, your path forward would be fraught with difficulty.”

Guan Yu nodded solemnly. A defensive spell could mean the difference between life and death during critical moments in battle.

“Though my magic cannot compare to Elder Jiu’s mastery,” Xuan Ming continued, “few in Cloud Azure Sect can break this Speed-Shelter technique. It should safeguard you adequately in times of peril.”

“Thank you, Master. Let us proceed with the imbuing immediately.” Guan Yu produced the Imperial Seal and handed it over.

The spell Xuan Ming prepared differed fundamentally from Elder Jiu’s previous protection. Where the elder’s magic transformed its user into an impervious golden statue through single-target defense, Xuan Ming’s specialty lay in group protection. His Speed-Shelter technique not only shielded multiple individuals within a defensive dome but also accelerated stamina recovery and wound healing for those inside.

Guan Yu recognized the tactical advantage. Combatants drained from spellcasting could gradually replenish their spiritual energy while sheltered – an invaluable feature despite the technique’s higher initial energy cost.

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi and Aze accompanied Peak Master Zheng back to Suspended Peak’s assigned quarters. Each sect delegation received designated rooms on Tiger Head Peak for the assembly’s duration.

With Suspended Peak’s small contingent, they shared two rooms. Peak Master Zheng addressed his disciples upon returning: “Aze, recount tonight’s events in detail.”

After hearing the full account, Zheng stared in astonishment. “You claim Guan Yu practices both martial and magical cultivation? This cannot be!”

“Master, we witnessed it ourselves!” Aze insisted. “When A-Cai swung his sword, Guan Yu moved faster than sight. Before anyone reacted, he’d already kicked the attacker away, then activated the Imperial Seal’s emergency defense. What else could explain this?”

Xiao Zhi added, “Father, consider this – why else would Uncle Lu and the Sect Leader gift him top-grade artifacts during initiation? They clearly recognize his extraordinary potential.”

Zheng slowly nodded. “Your reasoning holds merit. With a First-Class Mid-Rank guardian constantly at his side, Guan Yu’s background must be extraordinary. Cultivate your friendship carefully – he may prove crucial to Suspended Peak’s future.”

“That guardian’s power...” Aze shuddered. “He appeared like lightning when Peak Master Xiang attacked. Before we blinked, Xiang’s hair was sheared off.”

“A First-Class Mid-Rank warrior’s might defies imagination,” Zheng said gravely. “Had Elder Lu not shouted for mercy, it would have been Xiang’s head rolling. Such practitioners can cross hundreds of meters in an eyeblink once they break through to First-Class realm.”

**Chapter 3268: Never Offend Him**

Elsewhere, Peak Master Dai gathered her disciples – only five including herself. “Si Qi, explain tonight’s incident. Did Guan Yu truly humble Peak Master Xiang?”

“It was his companion, Second to the Wolf,” Si Qi clarified. “When Xiang prepared a high-level spell against Guan Yu, that guardian moved like wind. Before anyone reacted, Xiang’s topknot lay severed on the ground.”

Dai maintained a solemn expression despite inner satisfaction. “And you intervened against Xiang? You know his vindictive nature!”

Si Qi detailed the confrontation’s origins – Xiao Zhi’s provocative comment about Xiang’s hairpiece sparking the conflict.

“Guan Yu spat phlegm into someone’s mouth?!” Dai wrinkled her nose in disgust.

“But Master,” Xiao Tong interjected unexpectedly, “his martial prowess is undeniable. When A-Cai struck, Guan Yu vanished from the sword’s path and countered faster than sight. Only qi cultivation explains such speed!”

**Chapter 3269: Underestimating Him**

Dai absorbed this revelation. A dual cultivator – unprecedented in Cloud Azure Sect’s history. “We’ve sorely underestimated that young man,” she murmured. “Si Qi, maintain close relations but avoid provoking Xiang’s faction. The Left Hollow Peak now bears a blood grudge.”

As discussions continued across Tiger Head Peak, all factions reached the same conclusion: Guan Yu represented an unprecedented variable in the sect’s power dynamics. His dual cultivation path promised either glorious ascendance or catastrophic conflict – none dared predict which.
