Guan Yu seemed to perceive that the events which had transpired could not be succinctly explained. He pursed his lips and slowly rose with a nod.

“Please board the aircraft!” The interpreter, after consulting the city’s core leaders, hurriedly ushered Guan Yu forward.

Though capable of flight himself—and at speeds far surpassing the plane—Guan Yu acquiesced, both unfamiliar with the location and eager to glean insights from the interpreter. Without protest, he followed the man aboard.

Relieved by his compliance, the surrounding leaders scrambled onto the plane in exhilaration.

Half an hour later, the group arrived at the city’s most luxurious entertainment complex. Servants swiftly prepared an extravagant midnight feast, which soon lay spread before Guan Yu.

Having abstained from food for years, the aromas stirred his appetite. After gesturing briefly to those around him, Guan Yu picked up his cutlery and began eating with gusto.

To others, the act of slicing meat with knives appeared laborious—a facade of refinement masking practical limitations. Yet in Guan Yu’s hands, the blades moved like hot knives through butter. With dazzling flourishes, he carved uniform slices that stacked neatly upon his plate, leaving the onlookers awestruck.

Between bites, Guan Yu pointed his knife at the interpreter. “If you’re not eating, make yourself useful. Explain what happened these past years.”

“Of course, sir!” The interpreter nodded obsequiously. “Seven years ago, our planet was divided into nations locked in rivalry, each developing weapons to deter rivals. Then… the Divine Tower descended from the heavens into a nearby primordial forest.”

“Initially dismissed as insignificant, this extraterrestrial pagoda—untraceable by satellites—drew global curiosity. Expedition teams vanished within it. As nations convened to strategize, greater anomalies emerged.”

Guan Yu set down his utensils. “Greater anomalies?”

“The forest’s creatures began mutating—enhanced dozens of times beyond nuclear radiation’s effects. As humanity fought these beasts, they discovered proximity to the tower awakened supernatural abilities in humans. Nations abandoned arms races to vie for this divine site.”

“Months of battle proved futile. To contain the mutated hordes, this walled city was erected. Now, nations unite to send their elite here, hoping to cultivate empowered warriors.”

“How many have gained abilities?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Dozens globally. Other celestial relics appeared, but none rival this tower’s potency.” Nodding, Guan Yu gestured eastward. “I wish to return to Huaxia. That direction?”

“Correct! You… aren’t from this city, are you?”

“I emerged from there.” Guan Yu pointed toward the primordial forest.

“You survived there for years? Were you among the first researchers?” the interpreter stammered excitedly.

“In a sense. Have any others returned?”

“None. You’re the first! And while others gained powers, none match your ability to fly unaided. You’re unparalleled!”

Guan Yu chuckled. Mundane mutations paled before his cultivation arts. The世俗world couldn’t fathom manipulating celestial forces or bending reality itself—abilities he now wielded effortlessly.

After declining the city leader Motansifu’s pleas for alliance, Guan Yu strode outside. With a sleeve flick, cyclones erupted around him. Before the stunned crowd, he vanished into thin air.

“An immortal!” they whispered in awe.

Soaring undetected at hypersonic speeds, Guan Yu reached Huaxia’s borders within half an hour. Touching down in a remote town, he wandered streets unchanged by time—a penniless ascetic amidst closing bars and stumbling drunkards.

Seeking rest, he settled on a park bench. At dawn, a woman’s screams pierced the stillness.

Through shrubbery, Guan Yu witnessed vagrants dragging a girl into their makeshift shack. “Scream all you want—no one’s here!” one leered.

“Release her,” Guan Yu commanded, emerging from the shadows.

“Interfere and die!” a vagrant brandished a stick.

Laughing, Guan Yu caught the weapon. A surge of true energy reduced it to splinters. The men gaped as he advanced—a celestial wrath incarnate.

“Who’s next?” he asked mildly, dusting his hands. The vagrants fled, their prey forgotten.

To the trembling girl, Guan Yu offered a hand. “You’re safe.” His voice carried the calm of one beyond mortal strife.
