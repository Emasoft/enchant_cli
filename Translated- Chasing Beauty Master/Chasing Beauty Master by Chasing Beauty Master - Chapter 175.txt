Wang Jie shifted the topic, his tone thick with discontent.

As classmates present were well aware of Chen Ming's capabilities, they all cast scornful glances at Guan Yu, believing he would stoop to any means to win Li Xi's favor. Yet what did it matter? Once appraised, all lies would unravel.

Lin Lin also shot Guan Yu a puzzled look, pinching his back discreetly with her jade-like hand. "Younger brother, are you truly certain the ring is fake?" she whispered.

Guan Yu nearly sighed aloud. Hadn't Lin Lin been the most vocal earlier about the counterfeit ring? Why did she now doubt his judgment? Perhaps, like the others, she thought he sought attention through grandstanding, only adding fuel to the fire.

Still, curiosity about Chen Ming stirred within him. The crowd's reactions suggested formidable appraisal skills. Activating his scanning system, he reviewed the results and couldn't help marveling at the man's achievements.

Alas, Chen Ming had encountered Guan Yu.

Meeting Lin Lin's gaze with unshakable confidence, Guan Yu smiled softly. "Elder sister, trust me. There won't be any issues."

Lin Lin studied him meaningfully before falling silent.

Li Xi's expression grew complex. She'd heard from Li Yuanshan how Guan Yu's presence had secured their windfall during the Myanmar jade expedition, his appraisal skills reaching master level.

Yet she never imagined Guan Yu could discern a diamond's authenticity at a glance.

Of all present, only Li Xi gave eighty percent credence to his claim, reserving twenty percent for spectacle. Others remained unconvinced.

Turning to Wang Jie, Guan Yu chuckled. "Since you trust this man so deeply, let him conduct the appraisal."

Wang Jie sneered. "Having second thoughts? Apologize now, and I might magnanimously let this slide."

Guan Yu stretched lazily. "The apology's direction remains uncertain."

"Enjoy your brief triumph. Chen Ming, a drink's on me afterward." Wang Jie clapped Chen Ming's shoulder, handing over the Ocean's Heart.

Chen Ming nodded. All overlooked one detail - he'd been first to recognize the gem. Its authenticity was already decided in his mind.

Yet to cement ties with Wang Jie, he produced a loupe, adopting meticulous airs. Though an appraisal expert, career ambitions required boarding Wang Jie's corporate juggernaut.

After ten theatrical minutes, Chen Ming stored his tool. "Brother Jie, the Ocean's Heart is genuine - peerless in cut and quality. No signs of forgery." His sidelong glance at Guan Yu carried disdain.

Wang Jie's accumulated fury dissolved into triumphant provocation. "Hear that? Authentic. Cease your futile schemes."

Guan Yu ignored him, addressing Li Xi: "Do you care about its authenticity?"

The bizarre question stunned the room.

Li Xi's lips quirked wordlessly.

Understanding her tacit response, Guan Yu tilted his head at Wang Jie. "So trusting? Even masters err, let alone mediocrities."

"Insolence!" Chen Ming bristled. "I've appraised treasures beyond this trinket! What credentials grant you rights to judge?"

Wang Jie waved dismissively. "Denial becomes you."

"Who claims defeat?" Guan Yu countered.

Wang Jie's contempt deepened. Chen Ming's verdict was gospel. This obstinacy merely face-saving theatrics - he'd relish watching Guan Yu's final act.

Victory remained his regardless.

"Your next farce?" Wang Jie眯起眼睛，eyes glinting.

Guan Yu shrugged. "My appraisal method will prove it counterfeit. Rest assured - only petty minds plot thefts."

Wang Jie's composure cracked. "You..."

"Brother Jie, let him try," Chen Ming interjected. "More humiliation awaits this charlatan."

With a cold nod, Wang Jie gestured the gem's transfer.

Guan Yu weighed the stone, turning to Lin Lin. "Elder sister, I'll honor your earlier request."

Lin Lin blinked in confusion.

**Chapter 432: The Masterpiece Among Counterfeits**

Moments passed before Lin Lin recalled her pre-dinner jest about crushing Wang Jie's pretensions. Smiling bewitchingly, she purred, "Now that's my dear younger brother."

Her velvet tone stirred Guan Yu's pulse. Their intimate banter suggested hidden rapport to outsiders.

Grinning at Wang Jie, Guan Yu declared: "I'll appraise it, but any damage incurred proves its falsity."

Wang Jie scoffed. Diamonds resisted crude force - at most, Guan Yu might try the water droplet test, which he'd already verified.

"Proceed. But attempt sabotage at your peril," Wang Jie warned.

"Better shattered than letting counterfeits deceive. One fool suffices."

"Such vulgarity!" Chen Ming snapped. "Where's your breeding?"

Wang Jie's jaw tightened. "Eight million means little to me. But slander carries consequences."

Lin Lin giggled. "How noble my brother acts!"

Guan Yu's ears reddened at her boldness. To redirect attention, he requested: "Sister Lin, procure a small hammer."

Her eyes sparkled. "Were you asking for dewy maidens, I'd provide those too."

The hammer arrived. Guan Yu hefted it. "Prepared?"

Wang Jie watched like observing village idiocy. Smashing diamonds required superhuman strength - pure fantasy. Yet refusing would seem petty.

"Damage it, and you pay eight million," Wang Jie gritted.

"Authenticity proven, I'll compensate," Li Xi interjected coolly.

Guan Yu rolled eyes - she'd stolen his heroic line.

Wang Jie's eye twitched at Li Xi's uncharacteristic support. "Proceed."

"You'd bludgeon Ocean's Heart?!" Chen Ming protested.

"The owner consents. Objections?" Guan Yu retorted.

Wang Jie's meaningful glance went unheeded by Chen Ming.

Guan Yu examined the gem admiringly. "A counterfeit masterpiece indeed."

Platinum prongs yielded to his wrench. The stone clattered floorward.

Muscles coiled, hammer arced downward - enhanced by gravitational systems.

*Thud.*

Hearts lurched with the impact.

*Crack.*

Eyes bulged at the shattered fragments.

**Chapter 433: Waste Not**

Guan Yu lifted his hammer, smirk unfolding.

The demolished gem redefined their reality. When had diamonds turned so fragile?

Dawning comprehension eroded Wang Jie's credibility.

Stupefied, Wang Jie stammered, "You maniac! Eight million destroyed!"

Lin Lin recovered first, sneering: "Still denying your fake, fool?"

Guan Yu coldly explained: "Outer layer - genuine blue diamond. Core - blue glass. Seamless fusion marks masterwork. Introduce me to this artisan, Wang公子?"

Lin Lin added salt: "Eight million for counterfeit? Partnering with such masters must profit immensely!"

Wang Jie fled under withering gazes, dignity in tatters.

Lin Lin's laughter shook her scandalously clad bosom - sheer blazer revealing purple lace hints. Guan Yu's blood surged until Li Xi's amused stare cooled his ardor.

The shattered remains testified to humiliated pretensions.
