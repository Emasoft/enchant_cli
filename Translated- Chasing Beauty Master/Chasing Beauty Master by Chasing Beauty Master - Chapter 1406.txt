“What is this ‘technology’ you speak of? Is it edible?” the Demon Lord quipped humorously.

Guan Yu chuckled and explained, “Technology, in our terms, refers to modern scientific products. These products are manufactured through numerous intricate processes requiring specialized instruments—all embodiments of technological advancement.”

Realizing his explanation fell short, Guan Yu suddenly recalled something. “In my quarters, I’ve brought items from my homeland. Xiaorong, send someone to fetch the large pack I carried here.”

Xiaorong cheerfully agreed. The Demon Lord grumbled, “In all her years since birth, she’s never obeyed me so promptly. Always argues otherwise.”

“Father, must you say such things? Aren’t you curious about Guan Yu’s technological wonders? I’m simply eager!” Wang Xiaorong retorted, already darting out.

Soon, Wang Xiaorong returned with an attendant bearing Guan Yu’s hefty pack. “Quickly, set it down carefully here,” she instructed.

As the attendant gingerly placed the pack beside Guan Yu, he retrieved a small vacuum-sealed bag of beef jerky. “I doubt you’ve encountered this here. Any guesses?”

The Demon Lord and Wang Xiaorong stared blankly. “It resembles polished stone,” the Demon Lord remarked. “Yet its surface gleams unnaturally.”

Guan Yu held up the aluminum-packaged jerky—a delicacy imported by Sakurako from her homeland. “This contains edible provisions. Observe.” He tore the sealed notch, releasing rich aromas of spiced beef.

Wang Xiaorong leapt up, astonished. “This truly is food? Beef, isn’t it?”

“Sharp nose!” Guan Yu laughed. “Indeed, beef processed through methods unknown here. Taste it.” He poured the jerky onto a plate.

Discarding decorum, Wang Xiaorong grabbed a piece. The Demon Lord moved to protest, suspecting trickery, but she’d already taken a bite.

Her eyes widened as savory juices dripped. Alarmed by her expression, the Demon Lord sprang up—only for Wang Xiaorong to exclaim, “Divine! The most exquisite flavor I’ve ever tasted!” She unabashedly licked her lips, savoring every drop.

Skeptical yet tempted by the aroma, the Demon Lord hesitantly sampled a piece. His head jerked in approval, thumbs raised. “Guan Yu! How is this beef so tender? The spiced numbness—what sorcery seasons this?”

Knowing explanations would baffle them, Guan Yu recited the ingredients listed: “Sugar, pepper, premium beef…”

The Demon Lord rubbed his temples. “Beyond ‘beef,’ these terms mean nothing!”

“I recognized ‘beef’!” Wang Xiaorong chirped.

Rolling his eyes at his daughter’s mischief, the Demon Lord reached for more—but she snatched the plate away. “You’ve had enough! These are mine now!”

Cradling her prize, Wang Xiaorong declared, “I must visit Guan Yu’s homeland! If this is common fare, imagine their feasts!”

**Chapter 3648: Expanding Knowledge**

Guan Yu nodded. “This jerky is mundane where I’m from. Consider this packaging—” He showed the layered foil-plastic composite. “Machines laminate these materials. No artisan could replicate this.”

The Demon Lord squinted at the metallic pouch. “What sorcerous material is this? Neither cloth, paper, nor metal!”

“Plastic outer layer, aluminum core,” Guan Yu explained, peeling the layers apart. “The vacuum seal preserves contents for years without spoiling.”

“Years? Even salted meats rot within months!” the Demon Lord objected.

“Different preservation methods. Properly sealed, these remain edible indefinitely.”

Shaking his head in wonder, the Demon Lord admitted, “Never have I witnessed such marvels. Today enlightens me.”

Mouth full, Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Show Father that weapon—the ‘gun’ that slew the Blood Lord!”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu produced his Desert Eagle, safety engaged. The Demon Lord hefted it. “A mystical artifact? Heavy for its size.”

“No enchantments. This is a firearm—a ‘Desert Eagle.’ Any hand can wield it.” Guan Yu demonstrated the grip. “Aim and pull the trigger.”

As he gestured, dark thoughts flickered—ending the Demon Lord’s tyranny here. He dismissed them.

Eagerly, Wang Xiaorong urged, “Demonstrate its power! Last time, the noise—”

“Very well.” Guan Yu positioned an apple across the corridor. “The report will be loud. Brace yourselves.”

At thirty paces, he fired. The thunderous crack made Wang Xiaorong flinch. The apple vaporized, the bullet piercing through a wooden railing into stone beyond.

The Demon Lord inspected the damage, awed. “Such instantaneous force! Why cultivate strength when this prevails?”

**Chapter 3649: Your Discerning Eye**

“With this,” the Demon Lord muttered, “centuries of training become folly. One click decides life or death.”

Guan Yu holstered the weapon. “Firearms evolve endlessly. This is but one model from my world’s arsenal.”

“Unfair advantage!” the Demon Lord protested. “Why hone skills when any peasant could master this?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “I wield it only in dire need. Your realm remains safe.”

Beaming, Wang Xiaorong nudged her father. “See? My choice proves wise!”

“Your taste excels, despite his… origins,” the Demon Lord conceded. Turning to Guan Yu, he asked, “Have more such weapons? I’d treasure one.”

“This is my sole defense. Perhaps later, I’ll procure another.”

As they returned, Guan Yu offered more jerky. Wang Xiaorong pounced. “You’ve more? Give!”

Laughing, Guan Yu relented. The Demon Lord mused, “I yearn to see your world. If even preserves astonish, what greater wonders await?”

“With your cultivation, crossing realms should be trivial,” Guan Yu replied. “Our worlds differ as day and night.”
