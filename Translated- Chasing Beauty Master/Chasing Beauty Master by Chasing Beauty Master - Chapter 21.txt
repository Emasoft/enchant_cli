Though she had rejected Guan Yu, Fu Linlin knew that his decision to study here was largely because of her. Already feeling somewhat guilty, she couldn’t bear to see him cornered in his room, beaten and humiliated.

Guan Yu frowned and remained silent, hesitating.

“Come out. I’ll tell you who they are and what they’re up to…” Fu Linlin stamped her foot in urgency, her words tumbling out hastily.

She knew his temperament better than anyone. Other excuses might have failed, but this approach would work. Back in high school, whenever clashes with local troublemakers arose, Guan Yu would exhaustively investigate their backgrounds—adhering to his mantra: *Know thy enemy and know thyself, and you shall never be defeated*.

Though now brimming with confidence—his gravity-manipulating coin granting him near-invincibility against a handful of foes—he still preferred to gather intel. Understanding his adversaries’ motives, numbers, and plans could spare him unnecessary trouble.

After a pause, Guan Yu asked coolly, “Where are you?”

“At the Lianfa Supermarket across from the guesthouse. Hurry!” Fu Linlin urged, peering outside to check if Wang Fubin and his gang had arrived.

“Wait. I’ll be there soon.” He hung up.

**Chapter 49: Retribution**

Hanging up, Guan Yu glanced awkwardly at Du Xiaojuan nestled in his arms. The girl gazed up at him, her eyes wide and expectant.

“I… need to step out. Wait here, okay?” he murmured.

“Maybe I should go back,” she whispered timidly, though part of her longed to linger in his embrace, savoring the warmth and tenderness. Yet fear gnawed at her—fear of yielding to his persistence, of losing herself in the moment.

“I’ll return shortly. Want anything from the store?” He chuckled, pulling her close once more before leaving.

Exiting the guesthouse, Guan Yu headed straight for the supermarket.

Meanwhile, on the third floor of an entertainment complex near campus, Wang Fubin leaned against a pool table, conversing with a burly-armed man in a sleeveless shirt.

“Xu-ge, you’ve got to help me save face here! If word spreads that a freshman humiliated me, I’ll be a laughingstock!”

Zhao Xu, cigarette dangling from his lips, smirked. “Getting your ass kicked by a newbie at Tiger’s bar? Pathetic.”

“The guy’s no joke! He nearly made Tiger piss himself!” Wang Fubin insisted.

“Relax. We’ll finish this game, then handle your ‘problem.’ You know where he’s holed up?”

“The guesthouse. I confirmed it yesterday.”

With Zhao Xu and his Fire Gang allies, Wang Fubin felt assured. *Let’s see you smirk when they’re done with you*, he thought viciously.

“Xu-ge, after this, drinks and sauna on me—”

“Another time. The boss has guests tonight.” Zhao Xu chalked his cue dismissively.

“Right… Thanks, Xu-ge.”

“Don’t mention it. Crushing a student? Hardly a challenge.”

Inside the supermarket, Guan Yu spotted Fu Linlin by the entrance.

“Listen to me!” she pleaded. “Wang Fubin’s bringing gangsters to the guesthouse. Don’t confront them—you’re outnumbered!”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “You called me here for this?”

“We’re still friends, aren’t you? I don’t want you hurt!” Her voice softened.

“Of course we are.” He blinked, looking away.

“What’s Wang Fubin’s background? Who’s he bringing?” Guan Yu grabbed drinks and headed to the checkout, his tone casual.

Fu Linlin trailed him, sighing inwardly at his unshakable calm. *Arrogant as ever*, she thought. But here, without allies or connections, his confidence seemed reckless.

“Wang’s family runs a major real estate empire in S City. The Fire Gang dominates NJ’s underworld—I don’t know specifics.”

“Thirsty?” He offered her a drink.

“How can you be so calm?!” she snapped.

“Ah, right—you’ve moved on to expensive wines. My bad. I’ll treat you someday… when I can afford it.” His smirk stung.

Fu Linlin paled. “You still don’t understand, do you? Wanting security isn’t wrong!”

“Your choices are yours.” He shrugged, turning to leave.

“Wait!” She grabbed his arm. “They’re already here—Wang’s car and two vans! Don’t go back!”

Guan Yu froze, then spun toward the window. Three seconds later, he dropped the bag and bolted outside, gravity powers surging as he sprinted toward the guesthouse.

**Chapter 50: This Girl’s Not Bad**

Fu Linlin stared, bewildered, as Guan Yu vanished. *Why the desperation?*

She didn’t know Du Xiaojuan waited in his room.

Wang Fubin’s crew stormed the guesthouse lobby.

“Which rooms have male guests? Twenty-somethings!” he barked at the terrified clerk.

“Third floor… Rooms 34 and 41.”

“That’s the one!” Wang Fubin led the charge upstairs and kicked open Room 41.

“Where the fuck is he?!” He froze.

Du Xiaojuan sat huddled on the bed, phone in hand. “What are you doing?!” she demanded.

Wang Fubin’s eyes narrowed. “The fuck? Where’s Guan Yu?”

“Get out!” She glared, clutching her phone.

“Playing innocent?” Wang Fubin sneered. “Did his bed warm you up nicely?”

“You’re vile!” Her cheeks burned.

Zhao Xu eyed her appreciatively. “Who’s this?”

“Our campus princess. Never took her for a slut.”

“Feisty.” Zhao Xu stepped forward. “Name’s Zhao Xu. Need help? Just ask.”

“Leave!” She reached for her phone. “I’m calling the police!”

“*Police?*” Zhao Xu laughed. “You’ll beg for more once we’re done.”

As his men filed out, Du Xiaojuan’s courage crumbled. She scrambled to the window. “I’ll jump!”

“Fourth floor? Go ahead—might survive as a vegetable.” Zhao Xu advanced.

Tears streamed down her face. “I’ll die before letting you touch me!”

**Chapter 51: Skill Upgrade**

Zhao Xu licked his lips. “Feisty mouth. Let’s see if it’s as sweet—”

A fist smashed into his jaw.

Guan Yu stood in the doorway, eyes blazing.

Du Xiaojuan sobbed in relief as Zhao Xu staggered back.

“You’re late,” she whispered.

“Not for the main act.” Guan Yu cracked his knuckles, gravity energy swirling around him.
