Chief Seat Zheng nodded, pondering Guan Yu's plausible speculation. The Eight-Drum Technique was no easily obtainable treasure, and the emergence of false leads came as no surprise. These fabricated clues might well be the handiwork of Patriarch Menghua himself—a deliberate ploy to obscure the true path—or perhaps later generations' mischievous inventions.

"Seems I must visit Tigerhead Peak soon," Chief Seat Zheng declared. "I'll discuss these possibilities with Sect Leader. If these rumors were false from the outset, it might dispel his lingering doubts."

Guan Yu considered this favorable. Should Xuanming's suspicions fester, questions about his competence—even accusations of withholding information—might arise. Chief Seat Zheng's intervention could reshape the sect leader's perspective.

Xiao Zhi, having listened intently, interjected, "Since the Eight-Drum Technique surfaced, the martial world's been in turmoil. Even the long-dormant True Sun Sect now stirs."

"Aye, matters darken," Chief Seat Zheng sighed. "We must accelerate preparations."

Guan Yu countered, "I say this entire affair reeks of deception—either Patriarch Menghua's posthumous trickery or the Demonic Soul Sect's disruption tactic. The so-called Eight-Drum Technique might not exist at all! Perhaps four volumes never existed—mere demonic boasts!"

Wang Jun queried, "Then why vie for it?" His question underscored Guan Yu's hypothesis.

"Human greed," Guan Yu explained. "Noble rhetoric aside, orthodox factions fear the Demonic Soul Sect obtaining powerful techniques. Hence their desperate race to seize it first. Yet consider—even if real, these were demonic patriarch's legacies. By what right do orthodox sects plunder them?"

**Chapter 4693: Differing Standpoints**

"To prevent demonic atrocities!" Chief Seat Zheng rebuked, his expression hardening. "Such irresponsible words, Guan Yu!"

Guan Yu bit his tongue, realizing his misstep. Chief Seat Zheng, thoroughly indoctrinated by Cloud Azure Sect's orthodoxy, championed their so-called righteousness. Though inwardly scornful—viewing orthodox methods as thinly veiled thievery—Guan Yu held silence. He knew the Eight-Drum Technique's reality, having secured two volumes himself. His denial merely served to obscure truths from Cloud Azure's leadership.

True righteousness, he mused, shouldn't involve stealing ancestral techniques but devising countermeasures against their use. Yet orthodox factions brazenly pillaged under moral pretense—hypocrisy masquerading as virtue.

Wang Jun interjected diplomatically, "Whatever the Demonic Soul Sect pursues surely bodes ill. We must thwart their schemes." His words eased tensions.

Xiao Zhi proposed, "Preparations complete. Let's dine while conversing."

The group adjourned to Suspended Peak's modest yet immaculate dining hall—seldom used, as disciples typically took meals privately. Today's gathering warranted formality: circular tables arranged, core members seated hierarchically. Chief Seat Zheng and his wife presided, flanked by Xiao Zhi, Du Bingyan, Wang Jun, Guan Yu, and A'Ze—the peak's head disciple.

During the meal, Luo Jie engaged Du Bingyan in familial chatter, inadvertently reopening old wounds. Chief Seat Zheng, unusually festive, broke abstinence to toast Guan Yu with specially procured wine and meats.

Amidst the spread of expertly prepared dishes, Xiao Zhi served Du Bingyan portions. "Consider us family," he urged.

Guan Yu proclaimed, "Today celebrates Xiao Zhi's joy and Suspended Peak's auspicious occasion. Let past sorrows rest." Producing a golden leaf, he offered, "For our new sister—a humble gift."

Du Bingyan recoiled at the glittering offering. "Too generous! I couldn't—"

Xiao Zhi intercepted the leaf. "Foolish! When does Guan Yu part with gold? Treasure this rarity." His jest eased her discomfort as Wang Jun added, "Guan Yu's coffers overflow. This trifle barely dents them."

When Du Bingyan acquiesced, Guan Yu mock-warned Xiao Zhi, "This is her private stash—not yours to pilfer!"

Wang Jun presented his gift—a pearlescent orb in an intricate box. "A modest token."

Luo Jie's scrutiny prompted Chief Seat Zheng's examination. His hands trembled. "Dragon's Eye Amber! The rarest white variant!"

**Chapter 4694: Priceless Orb**

At Chief Seat Zheng's awe, Wang Jun explained its origin—a chance discovery during苗 City's chaos.

"Fate's darling!" Chief Seat Zheng marveled. "This surpasses the bloodstone factions battled over!" (Unbeknownst to all, Guan Yu had secured said bloodstone through Xiao Mei.)

Xiao Zhi pressed, "Explain its significance!"

Luo Jie recounted the legend: A tyrannical dragon king's eyes, transformed into amber after betrayal. "Possession grants immense power."

Chief Seat Zheng clarified, "This white variant's value transcends kingdoms. You've stumbled upon martial world's greatest treasure!"

Wang Jun blinked. "Useful how? Valuable how?"

**Chapter 4695: Ill-Suited Treasure**

Chief Seat Zheng's eyes gleamed. "The Amber's legend holds truth. Its energy..."

As discussions unfolded, Guan Yu noted the irony—orthodox leaders coveting what they condemned, while true treasures circulated through chance and cunning. The feast continued, shadows of coming conflicts lurking beneath celebratory veneers.
