**Chapter 4265: Too Late**

Guanyu felt the time was ripe. The message should have reached Prince Zou by now, and lingering longer risked exposure.

“Let’s stroll outside. There’s nothing interesting here,” Guanyu suggested. To avoid suspicion, he led the two women through several shops. Both enjoyed themselves immensely before they finally returned to the inn.

In a narrow alley, Guanyu deliberately intercepted his pursuers. Seizing one, though without hostility, he said, “Return and inform the Crown Prince: If the crimes of the Imperial Guards are swiftly adjudicated, Prince Zou will agree to meet him upon receiving confirmation.”

The message was clear. Now, it depended on how the Elite Guard would act.

Yu Shu sat in a chamber of the City Lord’s residence, his two subordinates standing before him. “How were you discovered? Did they know they were being followed from the start?”

“Sir, that’s unlikely. We rotated personnel at intervals—they shouldn’t have noticed.”

“Then why were you exposed?” Yu Shu snapped, frustration rising. “Useless! Can’t even handle simple surveillance!”

“Did you see whom they met?”

The men exchanged glances. “No,” one admitted. “They wandered everywhere, shopping and mingling with crowds. We couldn’t pinpoint the contact.”

“So you know nothing!” Yu Shu stood, jabbing a finger at them. “Pathetic! Tracked the entire time and didn’t realize it!”

Regardless, the message had been delivered. Yu Shu decided to inform Yu Kong and let the Crown Prince decide the next move.

By noon the next day, news arrived from the capital. Yu Kong’s orders commanded Yu Shu to continue searching for Prince Zou while spreading word of the Crown Prince’s willingness to negotiate. Additionally, case files, witnesses, and evidence were to be escorted back to the capital.

That night, the Crown Prince met Yu Kong in his study. The latter had slipped out of the palace to relay a message from Consort Guifen: “Her Majesty asks if you require aid. If pressures mount, seek her in the rear palace.”

Consort Guifen, thrilled by Yu Kong’s reports of the Crown Prince’s sudden shrewdness, had clamored to see her son but refrained due to the precarious situation. As a mother, she celebrated this awakening—proof her years of effort hadn’t been wasted.

“All is proceeding as planned,” the Crown Prince replied calmly. “Tell my mother not to worry. Caution remains paramount.”

“I shall convey this, Your Highness,” Yu Kong said. “When will you present the evidence?”

“At tomorrow’s morning court assembly. I’ll expose the Imperial Guards’ crimes before the entire court, ensuring their downfall—and Chancellor Li’s ruin.”

Yu Kong nodded. “This will irrevocably sever ties with the Second Prince. After this, expect turbulence. Avoid provocation; do not give him pretexts.”

“I fear no consequences,” the Crown Prince declared, his newfound confidence striking Yu Kong as almost alien. The timid, evasive prince of old had vanished.

**Chapter 4266: Authority**

At dawn, the Crown Prince entered the palace with a box in hand, flanked by guards. The Emperor, weary-eyed, observed silently. Courtiers buzzed with curiosity—the Crown Prince, who once stood mute through assemblies, now commanded attention.

The Second Prince glared as his brother approached. Last night’s reports had revealed damning evidence delivered to the Crown Prince’s estate. Though seething, he dared not raid it—risking exposure as a regicide.

Since the Crown Prince’s startling rebuttal in the Imperial study, the Emperor’s favor had shifted. A recent visit to Consort Guifen’s quarters—unprecedented in years—signaled rising tides. Other concubines bristled with unease.

When questioned about her son’s transformation, Consort Guifen had deftly attributed it to latent intellect stifled by neglect. The Emperor, remorseful, granted her unrestricted access to their son—a privilege reserved for the heir.

Now, as the Crown Prince knelt in greeting, the Second Prince sneered, “What’s that *thing* in your hand? Court rules forbid unauthorized items!”

The Crown Prince met his gaze, towering slightly. “Since when do *you* lecture your elder brother? Has your education in etiquette failed so utterly?”

The Second Prince flushed. “Even the guards disarm before assembly! Your defiance insults His Majesty!”

“If I err, let the disciplinary officers act. Since when does a *second son* presume to chastise his elder?” The Crown Prince’s voice sharpened. “Do you fancy yourself regent, overriding our father’s authority?”

A stunned hush fell. The Emperor gripped his throne, secretly pleased. For too long, the court had bent to the Second Prince’s faction. Now, balance was restored.

“I—I never—” the Second Prince stammered, dropping to his knees. “Imperial Father, don’t heed his slander! I’d never challenge your divine authority!”

The Crown Prince stood unwavering, the box clutched like a weapon. Around them, officials held their breath, marveling at this unthinkable reversal. The fool prince had become a titan.

**Chapter 4267: The Evidence (Part 1)**

The Second Prince’s knees struck marble. “Imperial Father, I swear loyalty! The Crown Prince twists my words!”

Silence engulfed the hall. All eyes turned to the Emperor, whose expression remained unreadable. The Crown Prince’s accusation hung like a blade—a single misstep could doom either prince.

In his hand, the box held proof to unravel empires.
