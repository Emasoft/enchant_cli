“A bunch of useless trash! You let the Crimson Lotus Sect and True Sun Gate through, yet dare block me from assisting the Right Envoy? Have your brains turned to mush?!” Guan Yu roared, blending curses with bluster, hoping to intimidate the guards into retreat.

After his tirade, the guards seemed to regain some clarity. Guan Yu’s words held logic—if Cloud Azure Sect members had truly arrived, they wouldn’t send a mere dozen. Moreover, obstructing someone claiming to aid the Right Envoy could mean losing their heads.

Since they’d already allowed so many through, letting in another dozen seemed harmless.

“Fine. Take your people in. May you lend the Right Envoy your strength,” the guard captain relented, stepping aside with his men.

Guan Yu nodded, satisfied, and strode forward with his group. The thrill of bullying others into submission felt oddly gratifying.

“Stop them! They’re Cloud Azure Sect imposters!” A voice suddenly rang out from behind—a voice Guan Yu recognized with visceral loathing.

In the distance, a ragged figure resembling a beggar appeared. “Damn it all!” Guan Yu spat. “Ling Su, you cockroach! Still alive? Born to be a shit-stirring pest, aren’t you?”

“They’re Cloud Azure Sect spies, not Heterodox Sect allies! Capture them!” Ling Su shouted from afar, determined to thwart Guan Yu’s advance.

Though blocking Guan Yu offered Ling Su no tangible benefit, it sated his spite. If he could slip in afterward, seize the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, victory would still be his.

“Halt!” A Demon Soul Sect member pointed accusingly. “Guan Yu, I tolerated you for the Young Master’s sake. But if you’re smuggling Cloud Azure rats, don’t blame me for what comes next!”

“Are you blind? Can’t tell friend from foe?” Guan Yu retorted furiously. “Lay a finger on me, and even the Demon Sovereign himself wouldn’t dare protect you!”

His domineering declaration froze the crowd. Guan Yu’s influence under the Young Master’s patronage was legendary—no one dared challenge him openly.

“Look behind you!” Guan Yu added. “That wretch Ling Su is the true Cloud Azure spy—Xuanming’s top disciple! Check his identity before accusing me!”

The Demon Soul Sect members wavered, torn between conflicting claims. One guard recognized the woman beside Guan Yu—Siqi, Cloud Azure’s renowned beauty. Yet despite both groups being Cloud Azure affiliates, Guan Yu’s faction remained untouchable.

“Seize him!” the captain ordered, pointing at Ling Su.

Ling Su paled. “Guan Yu! This petty infighting only helps outsiders. How will you explain this to your sect?”

“You’re the dog here. I don’t roll in filth,” Guan Yu sneered. “Listen well—I’m entering now. Let’s see who dares stop me!”

His boldness cowed the Demon Soul Sect. None risked the Young Master’s wrath. Even the captain backed down, opting to arrest Ling Su rather than provoke Guan Yu.

**Chapter 4610: Holding My Hand**

Guan Yu swaggered forward with Cloud Azure Sect members, Wang Jun trailing proudly. A hundred Demon Soul Sect warriors had yielded to mere words—such power!

Others envied Guan Yu’s clout, but Wang Jun knew the truth: this stemmed from Wang Xiaorong’s favor. Without her affection, the sect would’ve crushed Guan Yu long ago.

The path cleared as guards hastily stepped aside. Siqi marveled at their fear but held her questions.

At the portal’s threshold, Guan Yu gripped Siqi’s hand. “Hold tight. Don’t let go.” They stepped through.

Blinding light forced his eyes shut, but he clung to Siqi’s hand. When his vision returned, desert night had become verdant daylight.

“Are you unharmed?” Guan Yu asked.

“Yes,” Siqi replied. Ten disciples emerged behind them—six missing.

“Scattered entry points?” Guan Yu muttered. “This complicates things. Stay vigilant.”

The tropical forest around them teemed with towering trees, humid and lush. Birdsong and floral scents belied the danger ahead.

“Where’s this ‘Divine Stone Mountain’?” Siqi wondered.

“Likely where the Eight-Sided Drum lies. We move—” Guan Yu froze as distant clashes echoed.

**Chapter 4611: A Strange Discovery**

Ahead, five High Mountain Sect members battled eight Demon Soul warriors. The obese Hall Master who’d wagered with Xiao Mei earlier subdued the last High Mountain fighter.

“High Mountain overestimates itself,” Guan Yu observed. “Exhausted and outnumbered, they’re doomed.”

Siqi nodded. “Others must be scattered too. At least we have ten.”

“Luck favors us,” Guan Yu said. “But these Demon Soul elites aren’t pushovers. Stay cautious.”

As they detoured, the landscape’s eerie uniformity unsettled them—replicated trees, cloned rocks.

“Are we circling?” Siqi whispered.

“No. The sun’s path confirms we advance,” Guan Yu said. Yet identical battle scars marred the terrain—charred earth, shattered stones.

“Look!” A disciple pointed to a field. A colossal claw-mark, twenty meters long, gouged the soil.

“Avoid whatever made that,” Guan Yu warned.

Deeper into cloned woods, fresh clashes erupted. Guan Yu hurried toward the noise, only to find Demon Soul and High Mountain remnants—and another claw-mark.

“This place echoes itself,” he muttered. “Stay sharp. The mountain must be near.”

As they pressed on, the replicated scenery gnawed at their resolve. Time dwindled—failure meant eternal entrapment. Yet no landmarks, no life, only endless verdant mirrors.

Ahead, another skirmish’s din beckoned—and perhaps, answers.
