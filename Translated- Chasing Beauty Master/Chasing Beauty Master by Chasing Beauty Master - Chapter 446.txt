The next morning at Kyoto International Airport, Guan Yu and Wan Qingyang arrived under the escort of the Zhou family. Today they would depart for G City. Eagle and Tiger from the Dragon Group followed, along with a tall young man standing behind Guan Yu like a bodyguard—his recently recruited subordinate, Leopard.

"Xiaoyu, I entrust Xiaoyou's matter to you!" Zhou Xiaochuan declared solemnly. In just days, anxiety had turned half the old man's hair white.

"Don't worry, Grandfather Zhou. I'll do everything I can!"

If earlier Guan Yu had helped merely due to his ties with Zhou Xiaochuan, Wen Shuquan, and Liu Jingguo, now he genuinely wished to assist—not for connections, but for the sake of an ordinary grandfather worried about his granddaughter.

"Grandmaster Wan, don't tell me you've never flown before?" Guan Yu teased as the plane engines roared to life, noticing Wan Qingyang's pale face and death grip on his arm.

Wan Qingyang wiped cold sweat from his brow, stammering, "I... I don't know why, but my legs keep trembling in this contraption."

"Damn! You've got acrophobia?"

"Seems... seems so." Wan Qingyang admitted awkwardly.

Guan Yu burst into laughter, drawing stares from fellow passengers. A cultivator capable of soaring through skies on artifacts, yet afraid of heights? Had he not witnessed it himself, he'd never have believed it.

After hours of Wan Qingyang's trembling ordeal, the plane landed at G City's Baiyun Airport. Regaining his composure, Wan Qingyang surveyed their surroundings: "This place thrives—vital qi flows eastward, bolstered by southern geomantic advantages. Wealth gathers here; its residents are all prosperous nobles."

"If cultivation fails you, fortune-telling awaits," Guan Yu quipped.

G City's province—a southern economic hub teeming with mixed populations—made an ideal hideout for the Demon Sect. Emerging from the airport, instead of lodging at hotels, Leopard led them to the Dragon Group's local branch. The Demon Sect's stronghold, discovered and monitored by their agents, lay ahead.

"What's the situation?" Leopard inquired.

Zhao Xiaolong, codenamed Wild Wolf, the local director, reported: "No movements yet. As they're cultivators, we dare not approach closely. They keep abducting girls from various places. Current observations suggest the captives remain unharmed—but we can't confirm none have been killed."

Leopard nodded silently.

"Rest first. We'll act tonight," Wild Wolf suggested.

Guan Yu pondered: "Leopard, you all rest. Grandmaster Wan and I will scout the location. Send a guide with us."

Guided by local Dragon Group members, they reached an abandoned factory overgrown with weeds—outwardly innocuous, but unable to deceive cultivators' senses.

"Deathly aura permeates vitality; wickedness festers within life. This is the place," Wan Qingyang confirmed.

Though lacking his companion's eloquence, Guan Yu sensed conflicting energies—a repulsive demonic qi clashing with his own.

"Since we've located it, we return tonight."

Under sparse clouds and bright moonlight, they soared to the factory on artifacts. While Wan Qingyang drew attention outside, Guan Yu followed the Dragon Group's rough map to a hidden tunnel.

The unobstructed tunnel ended at a wooden hatch. Climbing the stairs revealed a dim, narrow corridor lined with guarded doors. Black-clad guards—all at least Enlightenment Stage cultivators—surpassed Wan Qingyang's Qingyang Sect, rivaling even the White Cloud Temple.

The Demon Sect's years of dormancy had amassed formidable strength.

"Who goes there?!" A nearby demonic cultivator barked.

Exposed! Guan Yu struck first, but his qi attack dissipated against black armor conjured from swirling miasma.

Shocked, he unleashed palm lightning, killing several attackers—but the commotion drew swarms. Outnumbered, he dodged demonic artifacts and sinister spells, relying on gravity manipulation and superior cultivation to avoid becoming Swiss cheese.

Amid the barrage, an idea struck—the unremarkable black rod from the Dragon Group leader! Channeling qi, he swung the weapon.

"Capture him alive!" the demons jeered.

Suddenly, the rod blazed radiant, blinding enemies. Hovering above, it siphoned black qi from screaming cultivators, draining their powers into oblivion.

"My cultivation... gone!"

"Flee! Flee!"

Within moments, thirty demonic cultivators collapsed as ordinary humans. Guan Yu rushed through doors, finding captive girls—all listless like Zhou Xiaoyou, used as human cauldrons. But Zhou Xiaoyou was missing.

Interrogations proved futile. Rejoining Wan Qingyang outside, Guan Yu barely dodged a thunderbolt. Above, Wan Qingyang dueled a black-robed figure amidst dazzling artifacts.

Struck down, Wan Qingyang warned: "Careful! He's Heart Movement Stage!"

The masked foe rasped: "So you're Guan Yu?"

"Where's Zhou Xiaoyou?"

"Defeat me first!" The demonic cultivator attacked with mountain-crushing force.

Retreating, Guan Yu finally countered with full qi and gravity manipulation. Their collision split earth and air, leaving Guan Yu five steps back, the enemy three.

"Not bad. But this ends now!" The demon conjured a shadowy monstrosity emitting mind-rending screeches—until Guan Yu's black rod emerged.

Terrified, the demon stammered: "Impossible! That rod... it can't be!"

The weapon shattered the apparition. Fleeing, the cultivator vowed: "The Demon Sect will return in a year to dominate this realm!"

"By then, I'll have eradicated your sect!" Guan Yu roared skyward.

**Chapter 1115: Demonic Cultivators**

With the nationwide kidnapping case resolved and Zhou Xiaoyou rescued, a new problem arose—lingering Qi Gathering Pills in the girls' bodies.

"Can't you cure them all?" Guan Yu asked.

"Do I look divine? Fifty girls! Even with your South Ming Fire, it's impossible," Wan Qingyang retorted.

"Let the Dragon Group handle it!"

As Guan Yu lamented, Leopard arrived with a porcelain vial from their leader.

"Scatter Qi Pills—rare antidotes specifically for human cauldrons," Wan Qingyang marveled. "Extremely difficult to refine. How did your leader obtain so many?"

**Chapter 1116: Treating Zhou Xiaoyou**

Back in Kyoto, the Zhou manor bustled with preparations as Zhou Xiaoyou's cauldron maturation neared. Guided by Wan Qingyang, Guan Yu found himself alone with the unconscious girl in a room containing only a bathtub.

"Place her in the tub and remove her clothes," Wan Qingyang's voice instructed.

"Remove her clothes?!" Guan Yu's eyes widened. Was this salvation—or something entirely different?
