“Young lad, you really don’t need to,” the old woman said, though her eyes lingered on the silver in Guan Yu’s hand. He chuckled, pressing the coins into her palm. “Consider it appreciation for your craftsmanship. Even street food deserves its patrons.”

“Well then,” she relented, brushing ash from her apron, “I’ll wrap every last sweet potato from the oven. But there’s nearly twenty here—enough to feed a small army! You’re certain?”

Guan Yu’s smile turned wry. “Twenty companions await, each hungrier than the last.” He tactfully omitted that gluttons like A’ze could devour four in one sitting. These golden-brown tubers would vanish like morning mist.

The iron oven hissed as the woman worked, its layered design ingenious—flames below, thick steel plate above retaining heat. “Two ovens would double your output,” Guan Yu suggested, observing her flip the potatoes with practiced ease. “Sell one batch while the next roasts.”

“Bless you, lad, but most days I can’t empty a single oven.” Her calloused hands moved steadily. “Locals roast their own by hearthfires. Only travelers and rich folk buy mine.” She tied the parchment bundle with twine, the sweet starch scent mingling with woodsmoke. “Mind the cold—eat them warm.”

Dawn painted the streets indigo as Guan Yu returned to the inn. The parcel steamed in his grip, its earthy aroma rousing Siqi from bed. “You’re my hero!” She claimed two potatoes, cheeks dimpling. Before he could protest, the door crashed open.

Lin Chen stood framed in the threshold, eyes darting between them. A beat too late, he feigned nonchalance. “That smell lured me like a beggar to feast! Any spare?”

“You’ll wait your turn.” Guan Yu’s voice frosted over. Only Siqi’s warning glare stayed his hand—the fool had barged into a woman’s chamber at cockcrow! Lin Chen retreated, muttering oaths beneath his breath.

Later, on the frost-bitten road, Guan Yu matched strides with the sulking disciple. “Noticed anything… peculiar about Ling Su lately?” he ventured, studying the caravan ahead. “That tent fire wasn’t accidental.”

Lin Chen’s jaw tightened. “The bastard’s jealous. Thinks he owns Siqi.” His laugh held no mirth. “Our righteous sect? Ha! Wolves wear sheepskins same as any demonic cult.”

Guan Yu stored that confession like a dagger in silk. Let the fools tear each other apart. When the time came, he’d bury both wolves—and their precious master—beneath the snows of their own arrogance.
