Nodding, Sun Xiaoya sat expressionlessly across from Guan Yu.

Sitting with Sun Xiaoya, Guan Yu felt no pressure, casually chatting while eating.

“You came to City C alone to study?” Sun Xiaoya asked.

“Yeah. Why?” Guan Yu tilted his head in reply.

“Hmm…” Sun Xiaoya set down her chopsticks, biting her lip as she studied him.

“Uh… What’s wrong, Teacher Sun?” Guan Yu asked, puzzled.

“Nothing. Let’s eat!” Sun Xiaoya waved her hand dismissively, though her troubled expression and the way she picked at her rice grain by grain betrayed her unspoken thoughts.

After the meal, Guan Yu bid farewell to Sun Xiaoya and left the cafeteria, perplexed. *I didn’t say anything unusual—just mentioned renting a place and studying here alone. Why did she act so strangely? Is there something wrong with being alone?*

He hadn’t walked far when Sun Xiaoya’s voice called out behind him: “Guan Yu, wait!”

“Teacher Sun? What is it?” Guan Yu stopped and turned, confused.

“There’s… something I’d like to discuss. Let’s walk and talk.” Sun Xiaoya tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her voice tinged with awkwardness.

They walked in silence for a while, Sun Xiaoya still biting her lip.

Guan Yu coughed and halted decisively. “Teacher Sun, just say what’s on your mind.”

“My mother… Last night, she badgered me for hours to call you. She has Alzheimer’s, so I had to humor her. I said I’d invite you over tonight. Then… well, I was already struggling with how to handle it, and now you’ve become my student.”

Guan Yu nodded silently.

“Since you mentioned living alone here… Would you come to my place after school? If my mother sees you, I can at least placate her.” Sun Xiaoya spoke softly, eyes downcast.

“Oh. Uh… Yeah,” Guan Yu stammered.

“Is that okay?” Sun Xiaoya blinked up at him.

“Sure! I’ll gladly mooch a meal. Thanks!” Guan Yu snapped to attention, nodding eagerly.

“Then… I’ll wait for you in the office after school.” Sun Xiaoya brushed her long hair back, her tone uneasy.

Watching her return to the teaching building, Guan Yu wiped sweat from his nose and grimaced inwardly. *Her mother’s fixated on me being her son-in-law? What a mess. Tricking an elderly woman with dementia feels wrong… Ah, well—just a meal to build teacher-student rapport!*

Back in the classroom, only a few boys huddled together, chatting. Guan Yu took his seat.

“Hey, what’s your name again?” a boy across the aisle asked.

“Guan Yu.”

“Oh! Dude, you’ve got guts! Not only did you shut down our class belle, but even Yang Lin backed down! Impressive!” The boy grinned, thumbs-up.

Guan Yu smiled faintly. *This trivial drama is nothing. Back in Y City High, my reputation spanned every school.*

“But don’t get cocky. Yang Lin’s no pushover. He’s tight with Wang Jun from Class Five. Wang Jun’s the top dog no one in our grade dares cross. And… Wang Jun’s chasing our class belle, Xu Ying. Got it?” the boy whispered.

Guan Yu nodded. *Makes sense. But I’ll steer clear unless they provoke me.*

### Chapter 1619: I Know My Limits

The afternoon’s final classes were self-study, the homeroom teacher absent. Chaos reigned, laughter and shouts echoing like a party.

*Aristocratic school students sure are wild!* Guan Yu marveled.

During the last period, the classroom door swung open. Three short-haired boys stood at the entrance.

“Yang Lin!” called the narrow-eyed leader.

“Jun Ge! Over here!” Yang Lin scrambled up from the back and hurried over.

“That’s Wang Jun!” the boy beside Guan Yu hissed.

Guan Yu nodded thanks, sizing up Wang Jun: average height, sharp cheekbones, a face etched with menace.

“So this is the new guy who messed with my girl?” Wang Jun jerked his chin toward Xu Ying.

“Yeah, him!” Yang Lin jabbed a finger at Guan Yu.

Wang Jun swaggered over, flanked by lackeys. “New kid, heard you’ve got attitude.”

“State your business or scram. I’m not here to chat.” Guan Yu leaned back, unflinching.

“Bold! So you think you can bully my woman?” Wang Jun sneered, gesturing at Xu Ying.

“Who’s your woman?!” Xu Ying slammed her desk and stood, livid. “Take your fights elsewhere! Leave me out of it!”

Wang Jun’s face darkened. He lunged for Guan Yu’s collar—

Guan Yu exploded upward, fist slamming Wang Jun’s chest. The impact sent him staggering back, nearly toppling his cronies.

“Leave now, and I’ll spare you,” Guan Yu said coldly.

“You’re dead!” Wang Jun roared, grabbing a chair—

“What’s going on?!” A sharp kick to the door. Sun Xiaoya stormed in, frosty gaze pinning Wang Jun.

“We… came to borrow notes!” a lackey stammered.

Wang Jun lowered the chair, glowering at Guan Yu. “You’re dead after school.”

*Seriously? ‘Wait till放学’—how original. Can’t they come up with new material?* Guan Yu rolled his eyes.

“Out!” Sun Xiaoya barked.

Once they’d slunk away, she turned to Guan Yu. “Explain.”

“Nothing happened.”

“Nothing? He nearly brained you with a chair!”

“But he didn’t.”

“Come with me!” Sun Xiaoya snapped, marching him to the hallway as the class buzzed.

Back inside, speculations flew: “Wang Jun’s furious! Bloodshed at dismissal!”

In the hall, Guan Yu shrugged off Sun Xiaoya’s concerns. “I can handle it.”

“These kids fight brutally. Last term, Wang Jun stabbed two people off-campus. I’m worried—”

“I know my limits. Thanks, but I’ll manage.”

Reluctantly, Sun Xiaoya relented. “If trouble arises, come to me immediately.”

After the bell, she reminded him: “Meet me at the office.”

### Chapter 1620: Improvise

As students packed up, Xu Ying whispered to Guan Yu: “Stay in the office late. They’ll leave if they can’t find you.”

“Concerned about me?” He flashed a grin.

“I—! Just don’t get yourself beaten to a pulp!” Xu Ying flushed, hurriedly looking away.

Outside, Wang Jun and his gang loitered, weapons hidden under jackets. Crowds gathered, anticipating a showdown.

But Guan Yu slid into Sun Xiaoya’s car, waving through the window as they drove off.

“Roll the window up!” Sun Xiaoya ordered.

“Just admiring their dedication.” Guan Yu chuckled. *Sorry, boys—prior engagement!*

Wang Jun spat curses. “Hiding behind a teacher? Coward!”

Onlookers jeered, disappointed. Xu Ying, watching from a Mercedes, sighed in relief.

“Home, Uncle Geng,” she said, smiling.

Wang Jun’s gang dispersed, plotting revenge. “Tomorrow—we’ll humiliate him daily!”

At Sun Xiaoya’s apartment, Guan Yu hesitated. “Will your mother recognize me today?”
