“Because Your Highness fears death, that’s why you’re keeping such a distance from the opera troupe.” After speaking, Guan Yu strode toward the main hall, for the prince was already beckoning them.

At that moment, atop the stage erected by the troupe, a man wearing a monkey mask was practicing swordplay with a short blade. Though the performance had yet to begin, this figure seemed to be rehearsing. To most, it appeared routine, but Guan Yu sensed purpose in his movements—the way the short sword subtly angled toward the hall suggested he was measuring distances.

The trio entered the hall, where Magistrate Mao greeted them courteously and invited everyone to take their seats.

“Tonight is simply a gathering for merriment and feasting,” Magistrate Mao declared warmly. “His Highness wishes to express gratitude for your lifesaving efforts. We’ve invited you here to enjoy this modest celebration.”

“You flatter us, Magistrate,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. “To dine with His Highness is an honor we scarcely deserve—a blessing from past lives.”

Once seated, Prince Zou occupied the central position facing the stage. To his left sat Magistrate Mao, followed by Guan Yu, Wang Jun, and Xiao Zhi. To his right were Zou Wuxiao and Zou Wuhui, then three battalion commanders. The massive table, capable of seating thirty, felt spacious with only ten present.

Magistrate Mao owed his rise to Prince Zou’s patronage. Once a minor magistrate near Liaozhou City, his integrity had caught the prince’s eye, leading to steady promotions. Now, as governor of Lianzhou City, his fortunes hinged on the prince’s ascension—especially with the emperor ailing and Prince Zou poised to inherit the throne.

Xiao Zhi’s voice boomed across the table: “Such a feast for so few! My stomach thanks you in advance!”

“Eat and drink heartily!” Prince Zou chuckled. “Magistrate Mao has spared no effort—the finest chefs of Lianzhou prepared tonight’s delicacies.”

“It is my duty,” the magistrate demurred. “With Your Highness, Prince Wuxiao, Princess Wuhui, your trusted aides, and these valiant rescuers here—we are family tonight!”

The prince raised an eyebrow. “If we’re family, why exclude your wife and son?”

Magistrate Mao sighed. “My wayward son roams idly—he’d only disrupt this gathering. As for womenfolk… propriety dictates…”

“Nonsense! Let them join!”

Seizing the moment, the magistrate bowed. “If I may beg a favor, Your Highness. Once you safely reach the capital… might you take my son as your disciple? Let your warriors temper his idle ways.”

Prince Zou studied him. “You’d trust me with your heir?”

“Your tutelage breeds excellence,” the magistrate pressed. “See how your own retinue thrives! I’d have him learn discipline at your side.”

Guan Yu hid a smile. The magistrate’s gambit was shrewd—binding his family’s fate to the prince’s rising star without risk. Should the prince falter, no loss; should he ascend, the rewards would be immense.

“Very well,” the prince acquiesced. “If we reach the capital, send him. But I’ll brook no disobedience.”

As servants circulated dishes, Xiao Zhi attacked the seafood with gusto, while Wang Jun marveled at the extravagance—thirty-one courses, including a central roast lamb no one could reach.

“We need a rotating table,” Guan Yu mused.

“Like a lazy Susan?” Wang Jun grinned.

At the prince’s curious look, Guan Yu summoned carpenters. Demonstrating with a kick-flipped table, he outlined his design—a circular rotating centerpiece.

Amidst the clatter of tools, a woman in azure qipao wheeled in the untouched lamb. With flashing blades, she carved succulent slices for each guest.

“The secret lies in the marinade,” Magistrate Mao explained as the prince savored the meat. “Buried in earthen ovens before roasting—a technique borrowed from beggar’s chicken.”

Though Guan Yu found the seasoning mediocre compared to modern fare, he nodded politely. Xiao Zhi, however, devoured everything within reach—crab, fish, shrimp—like a man starved.

“Young Guan,” the prince observed, watching his composed table manners, “you dine like nobility. Where does such refinement come from?”

The unspoken question hung heavy, but Guan Yu merely smiled. “Your Highness honors us with this feast. How could we not savor it properly?”

As servants rotated dishes, Guan Yu’s eyes drifted to the stage. The swordsman’s blade still pointed toward the hall.
