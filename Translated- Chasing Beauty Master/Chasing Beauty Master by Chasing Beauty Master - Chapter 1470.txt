However, it was uncertain whether Xuan Ming would consent. The Cloud Azure Sect’s regulations forbade disciples from entering the restricted areas. Guan Yu wondered if his proposal to craft hand crossbows might persuade Xuan Ming to make an exception and grant him access to gather materials from the sect’s storerooms.

Xuan Ming remained silent, exchanging a glance with Elder Lu. Guan Yu sensed their reluctance to involve him further. It seemed he needed to embellish the story a bit.

“Master,” Guan Yu began, “if I could first craft a prototype using high-quality materials to test its power, we could later mass-produce these crossbows once we secure sufficient resources. Imagine every Cloud Azure disciple armed with such weapons—our combat strength would soar. Even if the Demon Sect outnumbers us or possesses higher cultivation, we’d stand unshaken.”

Xuan Ming stroked his beard, conflicted. The sect’s rear mountain housed a materials repository, but its treasures had been hoarded for centuries, accessible only to the highest elders. Allowing Guan Yu entry risked setting a dangerous precedent. If other disciples learned of this privilege, demands would flood in, and refusing them would prove impossible.

“Guan Yu,” Xuan Ming finally said, “your idea requires further scrutiny. Let me procure skilled artisans and common materials for a trial. If the results prove promising, better resources will follow. Agreed?”

*So he still won’t let me in*, Guan Yu thought, suppressing a sigh. *Hundreds of years old, yet still so stingy*. But he nodded. Skilled craftsmen would suffice for now. Once he demonstrated the crossbow’s might, they’d all regret doubting him.

He envisioned establishing a crossbow workshop in the city—a venture sure to thrive. Though wealth held little appeal for him now, others could benefit. Xiao Zhi or A Ze might manage the business.

“Since you hesitate to provide quality materials,” Guan Yu said coolly, “I’ll use my own ordinary stock. But expect mediocre results.”

“At least let me assign capable artisans,” Xuan Ming offered.

“Unnecessary. I’ll find suitable craftsmen myself and present the finished crossbow for your appraisal. But mass production for the sect? That dream may die here.”

If the sect refused support, Guan Yu resolved to sell his creations externally. “I’ll open a crossbow shop in the city,” he declared. “Should the sect desire them, your disciples can purchase them like any customer.”

Xuan Ming blinked. “You’d charge your own sect?”

Elder Lu chuckled. “Since when did our disciple become a merchant? If you lack funds, simply ask.”

Guan Yu glared at the two elders. “Respect my invention. These crossbows are *mine*—I won’t give them freely, even to sect members. Mass production requires capital. Unless you’re offering financial backing…?”

He recalled his time at Tiger’s Maw Village: money had bought crucial information. Here, as everywhere, wealth moved mountains. Those who claimed money couldn’t solve everything simply hadn’t acquired enough.

“Enough,” Xuan Ming interjected. “Producing these externally risks the Demon Sect replicating them. If their disciples arm themselves similarly, we’d forge our own demise.”

“Then keep production internal,” Guan Yu countered. “But you must supply rare materials. Alternatively, let me sell inferior models publicly as decoys. The Demon Sect would waste effort copying weak imitations while we stockpile superior versions.”

“A clever ruse,” Xuan Ming admitted, “but your blueprint shows only one design.”

“Others require testing,” Guan Yu said. “Materials and artisan skill vary. For now, secrecy is key—train trusted disciples, produce in batches, then store the crossbows until needed.”

Elder Lu frowned. “Why insist on external workshops? Is profit your true aim?”

“Innovation belongs to the world,” Guan Yu argued. “Secrets never stay hidden. By flooding the market with flawed versions, we control the narrative. When war comes, our disciples wield masterworks while the Demon Sect clutches trash.”

**Chapter 3834: Compromise**

After lengthy debate, Xuan Ming relented. “Produce decoys externally, but the true designs remain sect secrets. And should you need materials…” He paused, weighing the risks of the forbidden repository.

Guan Yu hid a smile. Whether through sect resources or his own enterprise, his crossbows would reshape the jianghu. Let the elders cling to caution—he’d already glimpsed the future.
