“Regaining face before Si Qi is of utmost importance to Lin Chen. Since Guan Yu dares to oppose him here, Lin Chen feels deeply humiliated. To prove himself in front of Si Qi, he resolves to beat Guan Yu into submission tonight.

Guan Yu stands aside observing the commotion. When Lin Chen notices Si Qi suddenly step in front of Guan Yu, he exclaims, “Si Qi, move aside! My spell might harm you!”

Already committed to casting his magic, Lin Chen cannot halt the spell even with Si Qi in its path. Deciding to apologize later, he focuses on teaching Guan Yu a harsh lesson to cement his dominance over Tigerhead Peak.

“Descend!”

Lin Chen bellows, veins bulging as pale blue light erupts before him. The radiant glow coalesces into sharp blades under the night sky, hurtling toward Si Qi.

Unprepared for Lin Chen’s attack, Si Qi has no time to erect defenses. A direct strike from these spirit-energy blades would cripple her.

“Watch out, Si Qi!” Guan Yu shouts.

As onlookers gasp, Guan Yu leaps in front of Si Qi. The blades pierce his body, forcing him back a step. Blood spurts from his mouth.

Lin Chen smirks, pleased his spell spared Si Qi but struck the “fool” who took her place.

Staggering into Si Qi’s arms, Guan Yu coughs weakly. She cradles him, crying, “Guan Yu, are you mad? Why would you do this?”

He smiles through bloodied lips. “As long as you’re unharmed, nothing else matters.”

“You idiot,” she murmurs, touched despite herself.

In truth, Guan Yu had secretly shielded himself with magical artifacts, minimizing the damage. The blood was mere theatrics to win her sympathy.

Lin Chen’s triumph curdles into fury upon seeing Guan Yu nestled in Si Qi’s embrace. “You bastard! Get out of her arms this instant!” he roars, incensed that Guan Yu achieved what he never dared.

As Lin Chen begins another incantation, Si Qi coldly warns, “Senior Brother Lin, do not overstep. I refrain from fighting you out of courtesy, not fear. Must you insist on humiliation?”

Her words echo Guan Yu’s mannerisms, amusing him inwardly. The more enraged Lin Chen grows, the better his plan unfolds.

When Lin Chen unleashes a stronger spell, Guan Yu rises unexpectedly and taps Si Qi’s shoulder. “Rest and recover,” she urges, alarmed.

Guan Yu shakes his head. “This is my fight.”

**Chapter 3161: Beloved Disciples**

Baffled by his resilience, Si Qi recalls Guan Yu’s status as a Realm Sovereign cultivator—his physique far surpassing ordinary immortals’.

In a flash, Guan Yu dashes forward, a dagger glinting in his hand.

“Agh!”

Lin Chen screams as the blade stabs his spell-casting wrist. Blood gushes, scattering the crowd.

Guan Yu looms over him, icy smile chilling. “This is your warning. Next time, my dagger finds your heart.”

Terrified, Lin Chen collapses to his knees, clutching his maimed wrist.

“What is the meaning of this?” Elder Xuan Ming’s voice booms as he arrives. Surveying the scene—Guan Yu’s bloodied dagger, Lin Chen’s injury—he sighs. “Guan Yu, must trouble follow you everywhere?”

The elder notes Guan Yu’s blood-stained lips but prioritizes fairness. “Si Qi, explain.”

“Senior Brother Lin blocked our path and attacked Guan Yu out of jealousy,” she states. “When Guan Yu defended himself, this ensued.”

“Lies!” Lin Chen protests. “He insulted you, Master! I sought to uphold your honor!”

Guan Yu counters calmly, “Ask any witness here. His pride couldn’t bear Si Qi’s company with me.”

Elder Xuan Ming glares at Lin Chen. “Fool! Guan Yu is a Realm Sovereign! You courted your own defeat!” The revelation stuns the crowd.

After sending Si Qi’s group away, the elder tends to Lin Chen. “Heal this recklessness. Let this be a lesson.”

As gossip about Guan Yu’s prowess spreads across Cloud Azure Sect, Lin Chen seethes with vengeful plans. Meanwhile, whispers arise—Elder Xuan Ming’s favor may be shifting, and Tigerhead Peak’s bullies have finally met their match.
