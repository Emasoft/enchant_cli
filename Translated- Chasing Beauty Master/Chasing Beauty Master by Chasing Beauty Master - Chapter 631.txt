Murong Fengyu noticed Guan Yu's gaze fixed on Tian Huanyun and quickly spoke up to divert her attention.

Chapter 1604: The Truth Revealed

“Guan Yu! You’re finally awake! I was so worried!” Murong Fengyu exclaimed, her face etched with concern. Guan Yu smiled faintly and replied in a slow, deliberate tone, “Master, I’ve made you worry.”

The moment he spoke, Ming Hanfeng and the others felt a surge of turbulent energy constrict their chests, leaving them breathless. Under Guan Yu’s gaze, Murong Fengyu had to channel more of her psychic power to resist the pressure. Observing the reactions of those around him, Guan Yu sensed something was amiss but kept silent, his eyes darkening. Their discomfort was clearly tied to him—what had happened?

Murong Fengyu noticed Guan Yu’s realization and sighed deeply. She had known his sharp instincts would uncover the truth soon, but not this quickly.

With a pained expression, Murong Fengyu began to explain, “Guan Yu, it seems you’ve already guessed. I won’t hide it any longer. But remember, no matter what, you will always be my disciple.” Guan Yu chuckled bitterly. His suspicions were confirmed.

Murong Fengyu recounted everything in detail, including how Guan Yu had transformed into a demon. Guan Yu listened impassively, his face a mask of calm, while the others cast sympathetic glances his way. He smiled faintly and asked, “Is that all?” Murong Fengyu’s eyes dimmed. She knew Guan Yu was putting on a facade.

Zhang Wuhen opened his mouth as if to speak but ultimately stayed silent. Guan Yu lowered his head and laughed—a sound that struck everyone as unbearably sorrowful.

“Leave now, or you’ll be harmed,” Guan Yu commanded, aware of the dangerous energy radiating from him. Without hesitation, he issued the order to depart.

The group exchanged lingering looks but said nothing more as they turned to leave. At the doorway, Ming Hanfeng paused and said softly, “No matter what, you’ll always be my dearest sister.” Tian Huanyun, standing by the entrance, nodded tearfully.

Watching their retreating figures, Guan Yu smiled—then fell silent. In the end, he was still alone. If only his father and mother were here; they would have known what to do.

Zhang Wuhen’s heart ached as he approached Guan Yu’s silent figure. “You still have me,” he whispered tenderly. Guan Yu froze, staring at Zhang Wuhen in speechless surprise.

The next day, a figure wrapped like a mummy appeared before the group. Covered head to toe in a long black robe, with even their eyes and hands concealed, the person held a brush. It could only be Guan Yu.

After a night of contemplation, Guan Yu had concluded that avoiding eye contact and speech might suppress the lethal energy pulsing from him. He’d asked Zhang Wuhen to find the robe, and it worked. The sight of him swathed in cloth pained everyone—except Zhang Wuhen, who had vanished by dawn.

Murong Fengyu studied Guan Yu and asked solemnly, “Are you certain about this?” Guan Yu nodded. That morning, he had entered the room in his shrouded attire and written on the table: *I must enter seclusion to cultivate.* Murong Fengyu was stunned. She believed Guan Yu was doing this for their sake, but she was wrong.

While the deathly energy within him was a factor, Guan Yu’s true motivation lay elsewhere. Hu Xiaohai, gravely injured while protecting him, still hadn’t awakened. Moreover, retrieving the Spirit Pearl meant Akali Li would not rest. Guan Yu needed to grow stronger—he would never allow such a tragedy to recur.

Three years passed in a blink. Zhang Wuhen had disappeared without a trace. Then, an immense surge of energy erupted above the demon realm.

“Another Realm Sovereign has emerged!”

“Fantastic! Our demon realm gains a new Sovereign!” The people buzzed with excitement.

“To reach Realm Sovereign in just three years…” Murong Fengyu murmured, gazing at the energy rippling across the sky. Ming Hanfeng smiled proudly. Guan Yu had surpassed even him! Over the years, Ming Hanfeng had risen from Saint Sovereign to Heavenly Sovereign’s peak but remained stuck at the threshold of Realm Sovereign.

“The Master has ascended! She’s emerging from seclusion!” Ling Chi exclaimed, staring eagerly toward the source. Jue mirrored his excitement. Three years without her—how had she fared?

In those three years, Jue had become a Realm Sovereign, while the others reached Heavenly Sovereign’s zenith. Their progress astounded Murong Fengyu, yet they remained dissatisfied. Now, with Guan Yu’s ascension, the gap had widened further.

Murong Fengyu and the others stood anxiously before a door. After three years, what would she be like? The door creaked open, revealing a figure cloaked entirely in black, eyes hidden.

The moment she emerged, they sensed the faint aura of death around her—too weak to harm them now.

“Guan Yu, you’ve finally returned!”

“Congratulations, Master!”

Guan Yu’s lips curved beneath the cloth. Unable to see her face, the group grew somber when she remained silent. Sensing their mood, she quickly shifted focus, writing with her brush: *What of the Netherworld these past three years?*

A heavy silence fell. Murong Fengyu finally answered, “Unknown. None of our scouts returned.”

Guan Yu pondered deeply. What could this mean? Had something happened in the Netherworld?

Unbeknownst to him, upheaval had engulfed the Netherworld. Conspiracies coiled like shadows. At the border between realms, within the Misty Forest, a figure gazed into the distance. “She has returned.”

Chapter 1605: Return From the Illusion

Like a fleeting dream, Guan Yu snapped back to awareness within the Divine Demon Tower. Horrified, he realized how long he’d been lost within its depths…

The demon realm’s trials—its loves, hatreds, and battles—had felt utterly real. Yet upon reflection, they brimmed with strangeness.

Dust caked his body like aged clay. Outside, darkness reigned—nighttime. His family and comrades likely believed him dead. Guan Yu sighed ruefully.

Circulating the vital energy within his body, his joints crackled like firecrackers. Years of stillness gave way to renewed vigor.

After completing an energy cycle, Guan Yu slammed a palm against the tower floor. With a *boom*, he shot upward like an arrow, hurtling toward a window sealed by glowing runes.

“Break!” Drawing on the techniques honed in the illusion, he channeled the Mantra of Mercy. The runic barrier dissolved like mist.

Effortlessly, Guan Yu breached the tower’s seal and soared into the night. Damp wind kissed his face—a jolt of awakening.

*The real world… I’ve returned!*

What of his loved ones? Arms spread, Guan Yu descended like a superhero, gravity’s pull negligible.

The tower’s surroundings lay desolate. Once-teeming with explorers during the Martial Heroes’ Assembly, now knee-high weeds dominated. What catastrophe had driven humanity away?

His initial mission here with the Dragon Group felt lifetimes ago. How many others remained trapped in the tower’s illusions?

With no functioning equipment to contact the Dragon Group, Guan Yu focused inward. His cultivation, once rudimentary, now pulsed at the Great Perfection of the Awakened Realm. The skills and techniques mastered in the illusion were etched into his soul—any one could reshape this world.

Had others escaped the tower’s grasp, or were they still lost, their bodies withering as their energy faded?

Pushing aside these thoughts, Guan Yu activated a spatial shift technique, streaking eastward like a comet. Instinct guided him toward his homeland.

Within minutes, he crossed thousands of kilometers of primal forest. Below, where impoverished villages once stood, a sprawling metropolis now sprawled, its walls resembling the Great Wall. Skyscrapers glittered, their lights rivaling any capital.

“Impossible…” Guan Yu descended, triggering blaring alarms. Searchlights pinned him mid-air as crowds gaped upward.

“A floating person!”

“He’s flying!”

Panicked shouts rose. Some knelt, babbling prayers in foreign tongues.

Alarms wailed as Guan Yu descended onto a rooftop. Settling at the edge, he stilled, blending into the night.

Half an hour later, helicopters arrived. A delegation of wide-eyed foreigners disembarked, hesitant to approach.

Guan Yu turned. “Who leads here?”

A flurry of unintelligible language followed. Frustrated, Guan Yu closed his eyes.

The group panicked, shouting orders. Soon, a translator arrived.

“Sir, I am the chief translator of Liero City. May I ask… where you hail from?”

Guan Yu ignored the broken grammar. “Where is this? Years ago, this was nothing like…”

“Ah! This was once a barren village. But six years ago, calamities decimated humanity. Survivors gathered near these… divine relics, hoping to awaken latent powers. For survival.”

“Calamities?”

“Perhaps… we should discuss this elsewhere?” the translator ventured nervously.

Chapter 1606: The Tower From Beyond

An uncanny dissonance lingered—had he truly escaped the illusion?

As Guan Yu descended, city officials scrambled to their command center, alerted by the commotion.

Landing on a skyscraper, Guan Yu waited. Spotlights bathed him in ethereal glow as crowds gathered below.

A helicopter soon returned with translators.

“Sir, this region was transformed after the Otherworldly Towers appeared. These structures—like your Divine Demon Tower—emit energies that either grant powers… or kill.”

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed. “Otherworldly Towers?”

“Yes. Six years ago, twelve towers materialized globally. Their energy caused mutations. Some gained abilities; most perished. Survivors flocked here, seeking evolution.”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. His three-year seclusion had spanned six years in reality? The world had fractured.

“What of China? The Dragon Group?”

The translator paled. “After the towers came… nations collapsed. New orders arose. The Eastern Alliance persists, but details…”

Before he could finish, a tremor shook the city. Distant screams erupted as a pitch-black obelisk erupted from the earth—another tower.

Guan Yu shot skyward, energy flaring. The translator shouted, “It’s consuming the city! Please, help!”

Chaos reigned as the tower’s dark aura spread, dissolving everything in its path. Guan Yu hovered, memories of his own ordeal surging. This tower’s energy felt ravenous—alive.

Drawing on the Mantra of Mercy, he unleashed a golden radiance. The tower’s advance slowed, its hunger momentarily checked.

“Evacuate!” Guan Yu roared, but his voice drowned in the bedlam. The translator’s team fled as the ground fissured.

Channeling all his power, Guan Yu plunged toward the tower’s core. Reality itself warped around him. Was this another illusion, or had the nightmare followed him back?

The city’s fate—and perhaps the world’s—hung in the balance.
