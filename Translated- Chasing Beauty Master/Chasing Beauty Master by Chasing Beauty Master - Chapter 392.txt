After all, back in Taiwan, he used to be the sole authority. Though he still held decision-making power now, his words and actions weren't as unrestrained as before - Li Xi had planted her people within the company.

Wan Qianshan (Ten Thousand Mountains) understood these ostensibly dispatched managers were actually Guan Yu's agents sent to monitor him and seize power. Though these people usually remained silent during meetings, they always prioritized Guan Yu's interests in major affairs.

"Boss, how do you plan to handle this situation?" A subordinate poured Wan Qianshan a drink.

"Proceed as planned! The moment that bitch arrives, detain her immediately!"

Wan Qianshan drained his glass, eyes glinting venomously. His repeated calls to Li Xi about company losses served only one purpose - luring her here to capture her and threaten Guan Yu.

"This operation must succeed without fail! Is that clear?"

"Understood!" Having never truly submitted to Guan Yu, Wan Qianshan had naturally kept back-up plans. All present were his trusted lieutenants holding significant company positions. Once they seized Li Xi, they could completely take over operations.

As he reveled in visions of humiliating Guan Yu after capturing Li Xi, his phone suddenly rang.

Guan Yu!

Seeing the flashing name on his screen, Wan Qianshan's face hardened. Since becoming Guan Yu's subordinate, the man rarely contacted him directly. What did this call mean? Was Guan Yu coming with Li Xi?

Even if both came to Taiwan, Wan Qianshan resolved to capture Li Xi as planned. Catching Guan Yu too would be ideal - eliminating future complications.

"Heh, Young Master Guan, what instructions do you have?" Wan Qianshan adopted an obsequious tone, though hatred burned in his eyes.

"So the great Boss Wan still remembers me? I thought you'd forgotten who I am!" Guan Yu's opening salvo dripped with sarcasm.

Wan Qianshan's eyelid twitched. Could Guan Yu know something? Reassuring himself that only present company knew about the kidnapping plot, he relaxed. These were absolute loyalists who'd never leak information.

Exhaling slowly, Wan Qianshan chuckled blandly: "Young Master jests. You're my leader. I'd sooner forget my own mother than you!"

"Enough empty flattery. I'm calling to inform you - Li Xi returns to Taiwan tomorrow!"

"Is that so? Wonderful! Rest assured Young Master, I'll take good care of the young mistress." Wan Qianshan smirked inwardly. He'd indeed "care" for that delicate beauty - with several brothers' "assistance."

Had Guan Yu known his thoughts, the man's third leg would've been forfeit.

"Oh, I forgot to mention - I'm sending someone with Li Xi. Prepare to receive them both." Guan Yu hung up without allowing questions.

"Boss, was that Guan Yu?"

"Correct." Wan Qianshan nodded. "He's sending an additional person with Li Xi."

"Isn't that normal?" The subordinate frowned. As Guan Yu's associate and company shareholder, Li Xi traveling with entourage seemed routine.

Wan Qianshan shook his head. Guan Yu's deliberate vagueness indicated this companion's importance might surpass Li Xi's. Capturing both would strengthen their leverage, but greater significance meant greater precautions...

"Wang Yang! Inform the men - plans changed. Hold position until Li Xi and this person arrive."

The subordinate blinked at his leader's severity before nodding.

This revealed Guan Yu's cunning. Though Lin Dong merely accompanied Li Xi as bodyguard, the unspecified warning made Wan Qianshan hesitate, buying crucial time.

"Darling, shall we go?" Warmth (Wen Qing) emerged with Liu Yunshu as Guan Yu hung up.

Chapter 982: Mother-in-Law

Though intimately familiar with Warmth's body, Guan Yu still caught his breath at her精心打扮 appearance. Her glossy black ponytail swung vivaciously behind a white blouse straining against full curves, lace bra faintly visible. Snug blue jeans hugged endless legs, the side profile of rounded hips and tapered thighs forming hypnotic curves. Stilettos added sensual contrast to her youthful energy.

Liu Yunshu mirrored her daughter's outfit - same jeans and blouse. Standing together, mother and daughter resembled sisters, stunning Guan Yu.

"Mom, see? I told you this outfit would dazzle him!"

Accustomed to housewear, Liu Yunshu's new stylishness reflected improved spirits under Warmth's fashion guidance.

"My wife looks breathtaking today. Auntie, you're equally radiant - I nearly mistook you for sisters."

"Enough, let's depart!" Blushing at her son-in-law's praise, Liu Yunshu urged them onward.

Their car sped toward the Liu family compound outside Beijing.

Though the Lius couldn't match the Wen family's influence, Patriarch Liu Jingguo's retired provincial cadre status still carried weight. However, the second generation proved lackluster - eldest son Liu Yunjie only managed municipal legal secretary, paling against Wen Baoguo's ministerial position.

"Husband, if my uncles say anything... don't mind them," Warmth warned approaching the estate.

"Why? Would they look down on me?" Guan Yu puzzled. As their niece's boyfriend, why would they care?

"My uncles and cousins... can be rather snobbish," Warmth admitted bluntly.

"Qing'er!" Liu Yunshu chided, though her smile conceded the truth. "She's right - not married yet but already taking your side!"

"Mother!" Warmth buried her face in Liu Yunshu's shoulder.

"Now now," Liu Yunshu patted her daughter before addressing Guan Yu: "Just treat it as home. Pay no heed..."

Her words tacitly acknowledged family faults while offering support. Had her father not been alive, she'd never have returned with Warmth's beau.

"Understood, Auntie."

Guan宇 remained unfazed. Let them gossip - he knew his worth as Warmth's chosen.

Upon entering the Liu mansion, the women's warnings proved justified.

"Well, if it isn't Sister Yunshu! Summoned us to flaunt your ministerial wife status?" A garishly made-up woman sneered without looking up from her mirror.

"Yazhi, I—"

"Ah, our 'Gold-Mouthed Sister' honors us!" Another interrupted. "Must remind us peasants of her grandeur!"

"Auntie, I—"

"Don't 'Auntie' me! Your golden tongue's blessings might strike me dead!"

Guan Yu's brow furrowed at the venomous exchanges. These supposed relatives behaved like sworn enemies.

Liu Yunshu's sister-in-law intervened: "Perhaps visit Father first?"

Nodding gratefully, Liu Yunshu led them upstairs away from the vitriol.

Though similar in age to Wen Gongquan, Liu Jingguo's frailty showed decades more. White-haired and rheumy-eyed at sixty, he appeared octogenarian. Three months' absence had visibly aged him further.

"Father!" Liu Yunshu's voice cracked seeing bandages peeking from his sleeve.

"Merely old bones bruising easily," Liu Jingguo waved weakly.

"Grandfather, did Auntie's family do this?" Warmth demanded.

Chapter 983: Wen Baoguo's Humiliation

Despite his former rank, Liu Jingguo shouldn't have personal medical staff. However, former subordinates arranged caretakers - conspicuously absent today.

"Enough gloom," the patriarch cut off inquiries before spotting Guan Yu. "Qing'er's beau, I presume?"

"Grandfather, I'm Guan Yu - Warmth's husband."

"Husband?" Liu Jingguo's gaze turned hawkish, decades of authority concentrated in that look. Unfazed, Guan Yu met it evenly.

"Good! Steadfast and principled!" The old man suddenly laughed. "Better judgment than your mother!"

"Father!" Liu Yunshu protested.

"Bah! Had Wen Baoguo shown half this mettle when courting you, I'd have approved! Minister or not, I still disdain that spineless—"

Guan Yu's eyebrows shot up. "Wait... Minister Wen was timid?"

"Shaking like a leaf at fifteen when Yunshu brought him home!" Liu Jingguo snorted. "Couldn't even admit being her boyfriend!"

Warmth gaped. "But Grandfather was already a general then!"

"Precisely!" The patriarch shot his daughter a look. "Ask your mother why he feared me!"

Blushing crimson, Liu Yunshu muttered: "I... may have told him Father executed prisoners during wartime..."

Guan Yu burst out laughing. "No wonder! Meeting an executioner father-in-law at fifteen?"

"Had he courage then, I'd have respected him!" Liu Jingguo grumbled, though amusement softened his edges. "Now look - my sons wallow in mediocrity while that trembling boy became minister!"

As melancholy clouded his face, Liu Yunshu suggested dinner.

Downstairs, the three Liu brothers waited coldly. Youngest brother Liu Yunjiao sneered: "Why this gathering? To feed us lies with food?"

"Where are Father's nurses? Did you drive them off?" Liu Yunshu countered.
