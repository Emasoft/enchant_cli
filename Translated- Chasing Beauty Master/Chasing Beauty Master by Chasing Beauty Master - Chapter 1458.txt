Yan Zhao had not anticipated that today, Elder Lu would confront him at every turn, seemingly preventing direct communication with Xuanming. He realized even a hundred more questions would prove futile—those two critical issues had already been evaded through Elder Lu’s vague responses. Pressing further might only arouse suspicion.

Xuanming also found Elder Lu’s behavior peculiar, yet he refrained from interjecting, as the elder’s reasoning held merit. After Yan Zhao bowed and withdrew, Elder Lu addressed the sect leader: “Senior Brother Sect Leader, the investigation into the traitor within our ranks must remain confidential. Should the demonic sect’s spies learn of it, they will surely devise countermeasures. Not a whisper can leak.”

“Junior Brother Lu, you overcomplicate matters,” the sect leader replied. “With the Cloud Azure Sect’s complete roster in hand, none can evade the roll call. Those absent or refusing inspection will expose themselves.”

“Senior Brother, we cannot afford carelessness,” Elder Lu insisted gravely. “Only through utmost rigor can we clear Xiao Zhi’s suspicions.”

Xuanming nodded. “Your caution is not unfounded. Once the final list is submitted tomorrow, we proceed. Yet do not overreact—Yan Zhao’s loyalty remains unquestionable.”

“I understand,” Elder Lu conceded. “But impartiality demands all undergo scrutiny, Yan Zhao included. My concern lies not in his integrity, but in accidental disclosure.”

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi wrestled with turmoil. Burdened by unspoken truths and lacking recourse to prove his innocence, he grappled with the unbearable stigma of demonic collusion—a charge far graver than murder or arson among righteous sects. Worse still, the inexplicable demonic energy coursing through him defied explanation.

Retracing events since his mission to the desert with Guan Yu, Xiao Zhi found no clear answers. Elder Zheng had initially forbidden his participation, deeming the journey too perilous. Only after Xuanming advocated for his rapport with Guan Yu did Elder Zheng relent. Yet after joining Guan Yu, disaster unfolded—the youth became a wanted fugitive, mysteriously injured and comatose.

Chapter 3800: The Course of Events

Fleeing to an old farmer’s cottage brought no respite. The subsequent pursuit of a black-furred monster through bamboo forests, Guan Yu’s discovery of multiple energies including the Eight-Sided Drum Technique within his body, the confrontation at Tiger’s Maw Manor—none revealed when or how Xiao Zhi had been compromised. Even after clashes with Yan Zhao and their eventual return to the sect, the truth remained elusive.

Yan Zhao’s betrayal now seemed glaring. His accusations against Guan Yu, the damning “evidence” of demonic arts, the suspicious medicinal broth—each piece aligned into a damning mosaic. Trapped without evidence or allies, Xiao Zhi realized Yan Zhao’s scheme: frame Guan Yu, eliminate rivals, and exploit the sect’s paranoia.

Chapter 3801: Do Me a Favor

When meal delivery arrived, Xiao Zhi seized his chance. Recognizing Wang Jun’s voice—a neutral-toned disciple from Bamboo Peak—he pleaded: “Junior Brother or Sister, I beg you—summon Elder Lu. Lives hang in the balance.”

Wang Jun studied him. “Eat first, then I’ll consider it.”

Xiao Zhi devoured the cold rice. “Tell Elder Lu I possess critical information. It concerns Guan Yu’s safety.”

“Guan Yu?” Wang Jun’s demeanor shifted. Accepting the offered black ingot, they warned: “I’ll relay this, but expect no miracles.”

As the cell door clanged shut, Xiao Zhi clung to fragile hope. One night—that’s all he needed. One chance to expose Yan Zhao’s machinations before Guan Yu walked into the same lethal trap.
