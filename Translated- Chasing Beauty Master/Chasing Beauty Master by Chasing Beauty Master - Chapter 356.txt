Her fair skin, tinged with a rosy glow, shimmered subtly. Her elegantly pinned-up hair revealed a slender, alluring neck adorned with a diamond necklace that paled in comparison to her radiant presence.

With exquisite features, a curvaceous figure, and innate grace in every gesture, she naturally became the center of attention at the club. Countless men cast longing glances her way, while women regarded her with envy.

Yet Li Xi remained composed, sipping red wine calmly. A droplet lingered on her crimson lips like dew clinging to a blooming rose, mesmerizing all who gazed upon her.

Even this simple gesture exuded irresistible charm.

Guan Yu clicked his tongue, reluctantly admitting Li Xi was a natural-born enchantress who commanded attention wherever she went.

After composing himself, Guan Yu pulled out a chair opposite Li Xi and grinned. "Sorry I’m late!"

Though he’d had ample time after Li Xi’s call, the charged atmosphere earlier had demanded he indulge in some mischief. After all, abandoning his plans for a romantic rendezvous would’ve been wasteful.

Thus, he’d chosen pleasure over duty.

Li Xi glanced at him coolly. "I’m accustomed to waiting."

Guan Yu shrugged, poured himself wine, and teased, "We’re quite in sync! I’d just arrived in Beijing when you called. Almost made me think you’ve been stalking me out of secret affection!"

Li Xi maintained her impassive expression. "You flatter yourself."

Wounded by her dismissive gaze, Guan Yu changed topics. "Has our collaboration hit a snag?"

Li Xi arched an eyebrow, surprised he’d guessed correctly despite her vague summons.

"Must I remind you our relationship is strictly professional?" Guan Yu leaned closer, smirking. "Unless... you’ve actually developed feelings for me?"

A mischievous urge drove him to provoke this ethereal goddess.

To gauge her true feelings, he even activated his detection system—only to be disappointed.

"Among my suitors, you’re hardly the most exceptional," Li Xi replied evenly, crushing Guan宇’s ego.

Though managing multiple relationships smoothly might be considered talent, Li Xi’s words stung.

"Let’s discuss the technical hurdles in our project," Li Xi redirected.

Their energy storage project’s success was crucial for Guan宇’s ambitions. Overcoming its challenges meant limitless energy reserves—a game-changer for his survival.

After brief contemplation, Guan宇 declared, "We press on!"

Li曦’s gaze intensified. "Even if failure risks your entire empire?"

Guan宇 grinned. "I built this in a year. Worst case, I rebuild."

Li曦 relented. "Tomorrow, meet Chen Lin—a MIT energy storage expert. His expertise might realize your vision."

When a server interrupted, conveying Sun Mande’s summons, Li曦’s composure cracked. Sun’s grandfather’s influence over her family’s jade business forced compliance.

Trapped, Li曦 turned to Guan宇. "Help me resolve this."

Guan宇 feigned reluctance. "Our partnership doesn’t cover personal disputes."

Li曦 countered, "What would make it ‘proper’?"

Their exchange hung as tension mounted—the high-stakes game unfolding in this elegant lounge.
