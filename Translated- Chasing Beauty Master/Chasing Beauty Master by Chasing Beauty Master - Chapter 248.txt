As for Lin Feng, Guan Yu also knew a bit about his character. Putting aside other aspects, he was a master with firearms, which reminded Guan Yu of another skilled gunman—Lin Dong.

He wondered what kind of sparks would fly if the two ever crossed paths.

As for the remaining core member, a man named Han Jian (Treacherous Han), he was nothing but a traitor. When Cheng Gui launched his overwhelming assault against Xiao Xiong, it was this traitor’s collusion from within that caught Xiao Xiong off guard, leading to his forces crumbling overnight. Another critical factor was Han Jian’s control over Mo Kai’s economic lifeline—a fatal blow.

When Lin Feng spoke of him, his voice carried both hatred and sorrow. Among the five sworn brothers who had once shared life and death, one had stabbed them in the back at the pivotal moment. Though not fatal, the betrayal wounded them deeply—a misstep in handling it could have been catastrophic.

Perhaps this was why Chen Yu and Cui Jian had opposed the decision so vehemently.

Lost in thought, Guan Yu and the others arrived at Xiao Xiong’s office.

---

The moment he stepped inside, Guan Yu was stunned by the office’s grandeur.

The six-hundred-square-meter space held only a desk, two chairs, a sofa, and a coffee table, leaving it strikingly empty. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows offered a panoramic view of L City from every angle.

“Young man, are you here to admire the view or to test your skills against me?” Chen Yu’s displeased voice rang out.

**Chapter 621: One Move, One Dragon**

Chen Yu’s sharp tone snapped Guan Yu’s attention back. Smiling at the man twenty years his senior, Guan Yu replied, “I wouldn’t dare call it a test—merely a friendly exchange. I hope Brother Chen will offer guidance.”

“Hmph. Guidance? Kid, here’s your lesson!” Chen Yu wasted no time.

His movements began—slow but deliberate, each step radiating solid, unshakable power.

In a blink, Chen Yu closed the distance, swinging a heavy fist toward Guan Yu’s face while driving his right knee toward his abdomen.

Guan Yu stood calmly, unfazed.

A fraction of a second before impact, Guan Yu vanished. Chen Yu, mid-strike, flew backward with a look of shock, only to be caught by an unseen force before hitting the ground. He felt no pain from the fall, but his stomach burned fiercely.

When the discomfort eased, he found Guan Yu’s smiling face before him.

Pale and conflicted, Chen Yu forced out three bitter words: “I’ve lost.”

“Th-that’s it?” Cui Jian gaped, eyes darting between Guan Yu and Chen Yu in disbelief.

“Chen Yu lost,” murmured the usually silent Wang Jun, his tone tinged with surprise as he studied Guan Yu’s enigmatic figure.

Among those present, only Wang Jun and Xiao Xiong could fully grasp how Chen Yu had been bested. Guan Yu’s timing and speed left even Wang Jun in awe.

He had witnessed it clearly: the moment Chen Yu’s strikes neared, Guan Yu accelerated like a shadow, morphing into a panther-like stance to deliver a devastating punch to Chen Yu’s abdomen. The flawless execution spoke of seasoned combat experience.

What impressed Wang Jun further was Guan Yu’s swift recovery of Chen Yu mid-air—a feat requiring split-second reflexes and precision far beyond ordinary capability.

Thus, with one move, Guan Yu had defeated Chen Yu, leaving him utterly convinced.

“I lost,” Chen Yu repeated, his voice heavy. He’d intended to humble the youth but instead suffered a swift, crushing defeat. “The new generation surpasses the old. Remarkable.”

“Just luck,” Guan Yu said modestly, his sincerity deepening Chen Yu’s respect. Talent without arrogance was rare.

Though defeated, Chen Yu bore no resentment. Turning to Cui Jian, he warned, “If you underestimate him, you’ll fall harder than I did.”

“Hmph! Think every genius is a dime a dozen? One loss and you’re groveling? Since when did you become so soft? I’ll reclaim our dignity,” Cui Jian retorted, though his stern gaze betrayed grudging acknowledgment. Guan Yu’s skill—or luck—demanded caution.

“Cui Jian, Chen Yu’s convinced. Are you prepared?” Xiao Xiong teased, anticipating the outcome.

The unspoken implication hung clear: Cui Jian would likely join Chen Yu in defeat.

Snorting, Cui Jian redirected his irritation. “Guan Yu! Rest up, then sit down for a game. How many stones should I let you take?”

Guan Yu feigned hesitation. “Brother Cui, that seems unfair…”

“Nonsense! I’m no hypocrite. Unlike some, I respect tradition,” Cui Jian jabbed.

“In that case, I’ll take three stones. Don’t blame me if you lose.” Guan Yu masked his resolve to humble the arrogant man.

“Three it is!” Cui Jian waved magnanimously.

Wang Jun caught Guan Yu’s subtle smirk, intrigued as the game began.

Cui Jian opened aggressively; Guan Yu countered with steady, deliberate moves. By mid-game, sweat beaded on Cui Jian’s brow, his pace slowing. Guan Yu remained unruffled.

At the end, Cui Jian sat stunned, staring at the board—annihilated by a “dragon” formation.

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “A narrow win by three stones. Without your handicap, the result might’ve differed.”

Cui Jian snapped his head up, eyes blazing. “You’re right! Let’s play again—no handicaps, you take black!”

The others groaned at his shamelessness, but Cui Jian pressed on. “Fairness matters! That round didn’t count!”

Guan Yu yielded. The man matched Lin Feng’s description perfectly.

**Chapter 622: Rivals to Comrades**

The truly shameless fear none but their equals.

Guan Yu’s Go skills were rudimentary at best. Against Cui Jian’s decades of mastery, he should’ve been demolished—yet his secret edge (a mind-reading system) let him anticipate every move. Cui Jian never stood a chance.

Was it cheating? Absolutely. But Guan Yu wore innocence like a cloak.

“Guan Yu, don’t indulge his tantrums. A win’s a win,” Chen Yu interjected.

“Traitor!” Cui Jian shot back. “Whose side are you on?”

“Yours, clearly—the side of humiliation,” Chen Yu retorted.

“Enough!” Xiao Xiong cut in. “Cui Jian, your move.”

The match resumed. Cui Jian adopted a cautious strategy, calculating each placement. Guan Yu mirrored Cui Jian’s prior aggression, his seemingly chaotic plays masking deeper cunning.

By the end, Cui Jian’s face flushed with defeat. “I… lose.”

“Took you long enough,” Chen Yu jeered.

“I was strategizing! Unlike you, I fight till the end!” Cui Jian barked, though his admiration seeped through. “Your foresight’s uncanny—like you read my mind. Even masters lack that. You’ll be Cheng Gui’s wildcard.”

Guan Yu sweat inwardly—Cui Jian had nearly uncovered his secret.

Xiao Xiong nodded. “I saw his potential. That’s why I entrusted him with Mo Kai.”

“Your vision prevails,” Cui Jian conceded.

Suddenly, he grinned. “Now, how about a spar with Wang Jun?”

Guan Yu shuddered. Lin Feng’s warning echoed: *Cui Jian’s a snake—he’ll bite friend or foe.*

**Chapter 623: The Stakes**

Cui Jian’s treachery knew no allegiance.

Among the five original brothers, only Wang Jun had escaped his schemes. Chen Yu, lured by “growth through combat,” endured weekly beatings from Wang Jun—harsh lessons that forged his resilience.

Now, Cui Jian sought to make Guan Yu his next pawn.
