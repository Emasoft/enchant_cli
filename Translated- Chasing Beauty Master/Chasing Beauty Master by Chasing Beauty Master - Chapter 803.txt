At this moment, a bright red Bugatti supercar suddenly roared into Century Garden Academy. Luxury vehicles and beautiful women always formed an eye-catching spectacle.

The beauty drove straight to the cafeteria entrance. Stepping out of the car, she lit an ultra-slim ladies’ cigarette. She had come specifically to find Cao Jin.

“Boss, there’s a beauty here to see you…”

Most students here were Cao Jin’s underlings. The message spread quickly. Soon, Cao Jin emerged slowly with a tall beauty in his arms, flanked by over a dozen followers.

Cao Jin appeared bare-chested with disheveled hair, wearing only garish Bermuda shorts and no shoes—a rare public display of his slovenly appearance. Having rushed down upon hearing about the visiting beauty, he hadn’t bothered dressing. During his years at the academy, countless pretty girls had succumbed to his charms—voluntarily or otherwise. His lackeys’ sole duty nowadays was scouting attractive classmates for him.

The tall girl currently draped over him was a first-year junior he’d conquered just yesterday. Sweet-faced and statuesque, she’d been “educated” within a day to serve him expertly, much to his satisfaction.

Emerging outside, Cao Jin’s eyes lit up at the vision leaning against the scarlet sports car. “What brings such a goddess to me?” he asked with mock formality.

“I came specifically to meet Boss Cao.” Her voice rang with crystalline clarity—a hundred-point score even without considering her looks. This siren’s tones alone could steal men’s souls. Imagining her breathy moans…

Cao Jin’s fantasy was interrupted as his current companion snarled, “Where did this cheap slut crawl from? Did your mother forget to teach you shame?”

The visitor took a deep drag before flicking her cigarette dismissively. “Boss Cao, is this the quality of women you keep? How could such trash be worthy of a hero like you? True beauties should accompany great men.”

Indeed, the tall girl immediately felt outclassed. The newcomer’s perfection made her appear utterly plain by comparison.

Yet anyone who climbed Cao Jin’s social ladder at Century Garden Academy wasn’t ordinary. Furious at being upstaged, she shrieked, “You fucking whore! How dare you! I’ll teach you some manners today!”

As she moved to attack, Cao Jin shoved her aside. “Get the fuck out of here! Don’t interfere!”

Everyone knew Cao’s ruthless reputation. Cowed by his bark, the tall girl fell silent.

The sports car beauty smiled approvingly—a sight that nearly vaporized Cao Jin’s soul. Her crimson lips parted to reveal pearly teeth as her gossamer gown hinted at voluptuous curves beneath. “Come with me if you want your gift, Boss Cao,” she purred, sliding into the driver’s seat.

Still dazed, Cao Jin stood frozen until her sultry voice snapped, “What are you waiting for? Get in!”

“Hahaha! Don’t mind if I do!” Chuckling, Cao Jin settled into the passenger seat.

In the confined space, the beauty stretched a leg between his thighs. The car rocketed from campus to a secluded lane.

Snaking her arms around his neck, she breathed perfume into his ear: “Do you want me, my hero?” Her translucent gown slipped away, revealing alabaster skin.

**Chapter 2037: The Wound is Poisoned**

Gazing at this celestial vision, Cao Jin gulped audibly. “I’ll die for you! Let’s skip the foreplay—I can’t wait…”

“Patience, hero. You can have me… after you promise me something.” She evaded his groping hands.

“Who are you?”

“Wang Ting.” The name meant nothing to him—beauty trumped all concerns.

Wang Ting was actually Wang Jun’s elder sister. Previously using male aliases, she’d adopted this feminine guise specifically to entrap Cao Jin. No one could’ve imagined “Young Master Wang” transforming into such an enchantress.

“Name a hundred tasks—just be mine!” Cao Jin panted.

“I need you to crush someone for me.”

“Who?” His hands kept wandering.

“Guan Yu from Kihuang Academy.”

“Guan Yu?” Cao Jin knew that name well—the man who’d defeated him in taekwondo and toppled the city’s four major clans.

Noticing his hesitation, Wang Ting taunted, “Afraid of him?”

“Me? Scared? I’ll fucking destroy him!” Cao Jin’s hands grew bolder. “Consider it done. I’ll break him for you.”

Wang Ting’s transformation served one purpose—to manipulate Cao Jin into eliminating Guan Yu. By eliminating her brother’s lover, she believed Wang Jun would return to her. Her plan required sacrificing her charms to secure Cao’s cooperation.

“I knew Boss Cao wouldn’t disappoint me.” She reciprocated his caresses.

Bewitched, Cao Jin would’ve jumped off cliffs for her now. When he reached lower, she intercepted. “Patience. Serve me well, and I’ll be yours completely afterward.”

“Deal…” Their lips met as her delicate hand slipped into his shorts.

Despite his lust-clouded mind, Cao Jin remained shrewd. He’d previously declined Feng Jiawei’s alliance against Guan Yu, preferring campus pleasures over risky power struggles. But for this goddess, he’d make an exception.

Confident in outscheming Guan Yu, Cao Jin planned quick action. His tournament loss had been under rules—now, the battlefield favored his treachery.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu rushed to the Sun family estate after receiving an emergency call. Jin Hua lay bleeding on a sofa, pressing bloodied tissues to her lower back.

“Who did this? How bad is it?” Guan Yu hurried in with a medical kit. Jin Hua’s pallor and green-tinged wound alarmed him—a poisoned sword strike.

“Disinfect it… the wound’s toxic… ah!” Her pained gasp spurred him to action. Placing pillows beneath her, he cleaned the lesion oozing black blood.

Recognizing the venom’s severity, Guan Yu sprayed heated alcohol on the injury. Jin Hua screamed before collapsing unconscious.

For two days, Guan Yu channeled inner energy to purge the poison. Discovering her mirrored organs—heart on the right, viscera reversed—complicated treatment. Finally stabilizing her, he sutured the wound.

Exhausted and starving, Guan Yu faced a new dilemma—Jin Hua needed IV antibiotics but couldn’t risk exposure. Remembering Qing Ling’er’s medical training, he raced to fetch her.

**Chapter 2038: Seeking Help**

At nearly midnight, Guan Yu found Ling’er awake in Pan Taisheng’s apartment. After explaining the crisis, they gathered medical supplies. Borrowing a van, they returned cautiously to avoid detection.

Guiding Ling’er through darkened streets, Guan Yu reflected on how integral he’d become to her life—reuniting her with long-lost father Qing Guanghui, now ailing from chronic snake venom.

“We’ll start with IV antibiotics and glucose,” Ling’er decided, clutching medications. “Adjust treatment after examining her.”

Approaching the secluded estate, Ling’er clung to Guan Yu—her anchor in this ominous night. Though frightened, she trusted him completely. In her reordered world, Guan Yu was the constant stabilizing force.
