A few minutes later, the gang of hoodlums slowed down dejectedly.

“Damn it! How did that punk make this bike so fast? F***! How are we supposed to chase him now?” The leader smashed his helmet against the fuel tank, his handsome face contorted with anger. His two silver earrings glinted on his left ear, adding a rebellious edge to his appearance.

“Big Bro, this road leads straight to the overpass. He either goes to the West Ring’s leisure resort—that tourist spot—or loops halfway onto the overpass toward Ermiao Temple. Let’s cut him off from the other side! Even if he’s fast, he can’t fly!” one of the lackeys suggested.

“Sh*t! Forgot about that! Let’s circle around and corner him!” The handsome youth slapped his forehead and waved his gang to take a detour.

After five minutes of reckless speeding down the nearly empty road, Guan Yu finally slowed the motorcycle. His wind-burned face throbbed with pain. Checking the rearview mirror, he sighed in relief—the pursuers had vanished.

“Let’s stop and rest for a bit before heading back,” he said to Gao Wei, who clung to his back.

“Okay…” she replied weakly, her heart still racing. The thrill of speed had been exhilarating but terrifying. As her feet touched solid ground again, she glared at Guan Yu. “You’re insane! Riding faster than a plane! You nearly scared me to death!”

“Had to outrun them. If they’d caught up, I couldn’t have protected you,” he explained, rubbing his nose.

Gao Wei blinked. *Protect me? He was worried about me?* A faint smile touched her lips. “Thank you…”

“Don’t mention it. I promised Xiaojuan I’d keep you safe,” he muttered.

Half an hour later, with no taxis in sight, Guan Yu reluctantly restarted the stolen motorcycle. This time, he rode slowly. Gao Wei’s delicate fragrance wafted around him as she leaned against his back, her hat long lost to the wind.

To her surprise, the rhythmic vibration of the engine soothed her. Resting her cheek against his shoulder, she felt an unfamiliar sense of security. *Having someone to rely on… feels nice.*

The hoodlums’ detour failed—Guan Yu and Gao Wei had doubled back unnoticed. Lost in Nanjing’s labyrinthine streets, Guan Yu eventually parked near the Qinhuai River and hailed a taxi.

As Gao Wei stepped out at her hotel, she noticed Guan Yu’s wind-reddened eyes. “Here,” she said, slipping off her silver-framed sunglasses. “Wear these next time you decide to impersonate a fighter jet.”

“I… don’t ride often. Thanks anyway,” Guan Yu stammered, then froze. Without the glasses obscuring her face, her luminous eyes struck him like lightning—a beauty no photo could capture.

“Take them,” she insisted, pressing the sunglasses into his hand. With a playful wave, she disappeared into the hotel.

Guan Yu stood dazed, clutching the glasses. *She’s dangerous. Like poisoned wine.* Yet his traitorous heart fluttered.

The next morning, Guan Yu arrived at his university dormitory, only to find two familiar faces locked in a stare-off: the hulking Niu Le and the stocky Tian Hao—the same pair who’d nearly brawled over counterfeit money weeks earlier.

“You?!” they exclaimed in unison.

“Talk about fate,” Guan Yu laughed, dragging his luggage inside.

Niu Le, a burly northerner with a voice like gravel, broke the tension first. “Name’s Niu Le. Anyone messes with you, I’ll chop ’em!”

“Tian Hao, local. Call me Rat,” the shorter one added, still side-eyeing Niu Le.

As Guan Yu unpacked, the rivals resumed bickering:

“Real men don’t let their dads get bullied!” Niu Le growled.

“I wasn’t even there that day!” Tian Hao shot back.

“Enough!” Guan Yu interjected. “We’re roommates now. Drop the grudges.”

During small talk, Niu Le revealed his “audition triumph”: “The judges loved my ‘Two Tigers’!”

“The… nursery rhyme?” Tian Hao gaped.

“Yeah! Took me six months to learn!” Niu Le said proudly.

Guan Yu facepalmed. *How did this guy pass the entrance exam?*

Tian Hao admitted his own dubious path: “My dad’s neighbor was on the admissions panel.”

Shaking his head, Guan Yu realized his college years would be anything but ordinary.
