Guan Yu smiled at their astonished expressions. “This is perfectly normal. Kaihuang is an elite private school renowned throughout the city and nation. Its facilities, educational environment, and teaching quality are all top-tier. Hence the slightly higher tuition fees.”

Auntie’s jaw dropped, rendered speechless for a long moment. Shuangshuang recovered first. Though her heart ached at the enormous sum, she yearned deeply to attend such an exceptional school.

“It’s alright, Mom. Big Brother is incredibly wealthy. This small amount is like a drop in the ocean to him. He doesn’t care at all.” Even as she spoke, Shuangshuang comforted herself inwardly—the money was already spent and irrecoverable. This was the only way.

“Indeed, Auntie. Such a trivial sum truly means nothing to me. If I wished, I could earn back a hundred thousand in minutes,” Guan Yu chimed in, hoping to ease her concerns.

Auntie nodded weakly. “Very well. I won’t oppose this anymore. I could never afford such tuition myself. Consider it Shuangshuang’s good fortune to have met such a doting elder brother.”

Guan Yu and Xue Jing exchanged amused glances, surprised by Auntie’s uncharacteristic acceptance. In the past, she would have erupted in demands for refunds.

Two primary reasons guided Auntie’s consent. First, this opportunity greatly benefited Shuangshuang—an exceptional student yearning for better educational prospects. Second, Auntie sensed Guan Yu’s genuine commitment to guiding Shuangshuang’s future, especially after Xue Jing’s earlier remarks about potential relocation to Qiaoyuan District. Though aware of Guan Yu’s many female companions there, Auntie believed entrusting Shuangshuang to his care would secure her happiness and safety.

Having devoted her life to her two daughters, Auntie’s sole wish was their protection from harm. She trusted Guan Yu’s character implicitly.

With matters settled harmoniously, Guan Yu rose after some conversation. “To avoid delaying Shuangshuang’s studies, I’ll take my leave now. I’ll visit again when free.”

Pouting, Shuangshuang conceded, “Go attend to your affairs then.” Her reluctant expression prompted a wry smile from Guan Yu as he departed with Xue Jing.

Internally, Guan Yu debated how to tactfully leave Xue Jing behind to meet Jinhua discreetly. However, aware of heightened surveillance, he abandoned the idea. Safer to send the poisoned needle via messenger—Qing Ling’er being the ideal choice.

At 9:00 AM, Guan Yu arrived at Hua Ye Club where Ling’er had just begun her shift. The nearly empty establishment found only two morning staff cleaning. Manager Hou Jinshun still slept in his fourth-floor quarters.

“Here to see Ling’er?” Xue Jing inquired.
“Yes, some business.” His cryptic tone discouraged further questions.

A server approached. “We’re not open yet, sir.”
Spotting Ling’er upstairs, Guan Yu pointed. “We’re here for her.”

Hearing his voice, Ling’er turned with a radiant smile. “You’re here! Please come up.”

In her glass-walled office, Guan Yu admired the newly installed silver window films. “These improve visibility remarkably.”

After exchanging pleasantries and recounting the previous night’s assassination attempt, Guan Yu produced a small box. “Ling’er, please deliver this poisoned needle to my associate. I’ll contact her separately.”

Understanding his reference to Jinhua, Ling’er accepted solemnly. Guan Yu cautioned about heightened dangers from Bill Lin and Fang Su’s schemes before departing.

Next, Guan Yu inspected the leather factory—a vulnerable point in Yu Gang’s operations. Supervised by hall masters Gaozi and Guo Dong, the facility maintained uneasy peace with former Sun Xu loyalists among workers.

The appalling working conditions—poor ventilation, inadequate fire safety, and hazardous material storage—alarmed Guan Yu. He ordered immediate shutdown preparations for renovations despite pressing production deadlines.

Meeting factory managers, Guan Yu reviewed production schedules before emphasizing safety overhauls. Deputy Manager Guo Dong, a former classmate promoted within Yu Gang, coordinated shutdown plans around client deliveries.

As Guan Yu departed the noxious facility, his mind already strategized systemic upgrades—ventilation retrofits, fireproofing, and thorough background checks on new hires to weed out infiltrators. Every decision balanced operational needs against escalating threats from rival factions.
