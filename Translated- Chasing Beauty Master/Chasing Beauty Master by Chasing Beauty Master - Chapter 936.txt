At this moment, when Xue Jing turned around, the sight of her exquisite and charming face became genuinely captivating. The middle-aged man raised his eyebrows twice before remarking with amusement, "Um, may I ask if you're here to see someone, miss?"

The bearded middle-aged man's tone instantly shifted, adopting an exaggeratedly genteel and courteous manner. Xue Jing immediately felt repulsed by his abrupt change in demeanor, recognizing it as the mark of an unscrupulous character.

Without responding, Xue Jing retrieved her mask from her hand and put it on before stating calmly, "I am indeed here to find someone. Did your colleagues bring back someone named Guan Yu earlier? I need to see him." Though Guan Yu had already texted saying he was fine, lingering worries compelled her to verify his situation personally.

"Oh, this Guan Yu you mention—what offense did he commit? My comrades wouldn't casually detain someone without reason," the bearded man said while mentally calculating. Observing this beautiful woman's determination, he mentally reviewed every staff member from boiler room attendants upwards, confirming no "Guan Yu" existed within their ranks. Suppressing a smirk, he concluded this visitor's target must be someone detained for serious misconduct—a perfect pretext to maneuver her into his office.

"My friend was taken after a physical altercation. I need to take him home. Is he here?" Xue Jing inquired guilelessly.

"Ah, that's complicated," the bearded man feigned grave consideration. "Assault cases aren't easily resolved. Perhaps you should accompany me to my office. All case files are stored there—if Guan Yu was indeed detained, the documentation would have arrived. Let me check for you."

Beaming with counterfeit helpfulness, he gestured invitingly. Xue Jing, assuming his office access indicated authority, agreed to follow, unaware of his ulterior motives.

"Thank you for your assistance," she nodded.

"No trouble at all—it's my duty. This way," the bearded man replied, leading her upstairs while envisioning the private "entertainment" awaiting them. Though well-practiced in such scenarios, the prospect of this exceptionally beautiful prey excited him anew.

Trailing silently behind, Xue Jing noted the "Deputy Bureau Chief's Office" plaque before entering. So this was a vice-director—no wonder he claimed comprehensive access. With his help, she'd soon confirm Guan Yu's whereabouts.

Internally, Xue Jing cursed Guan Yu for vanishing without explanation, ignoring calls like some evaporated phantom. The irresponsible oaf had forced her into this tiresome search.

"Please sit," the deputy chief said with exaggerated courtesy. "Your friend's name again?"

"Guan Yu," Xue Jing answered, settling on the spacious sofa opposite wall-length bookshelves and filing cabinets. The deputy chief pretended to consult documents while covertly studying her legs, imagining the curves beneath her clothes.

After a theatrical pause, he stood apologetically. "Regrettably, I find no immediate records. But don't fret—I'll make inquiries. Meanwhile, have some water." He poured water with unctuous solicitude, strategically seating himself beside her.

Xue Jing, unsuspicious, accepted the drink. Parched since the restaurant incident hours prior, she sipped gratefully beneath her mask.

"Before calling," the deputy chief leaned closer, "where exactly was your friend detained? I need to contact the relevant task force."

"Outside Kaihuang Academy—a Western restaurant," Xue Jing replied.

"Ah, Team Dacheng's jurisdiction. Let me check." He pantomimed a call. "Dacheng? Did your team detain Guan Yu today? ...No? Perhaps Team Xiangjiao then..." Hanging up, he edged nearer. "Wrong team—I'll try others. But really, why keep your mask on here?"

"I prefer it," Xue Jing said curtly.

Undeterred, he feigned another call before practically pressing against her. When Xue Jing moved away, he exclaimed, "Xiangjiao isn't answering! They're required to maintain contact during shifts—could something have happened?"

Xue Jing's concern for Guan Yu overrode discomfort, allowing the deputy chief to "accidentally" brush against her repeatedly.

"Let me investigate thoroughly," he declared, dialing again under her anxious gaze. "Why isn't Xiangjiao answering? Urgent business here!" His loud protestations masked predatory proximity until Xue Jing occupied the sofa's edge.

As she prepared to stand, the deputy chief suddenly shouted, "What? Assaulted? You mean Team Xiangjiao was attacked?!"

Xue Jing froze, imagining Guan Yu injured in police custody.

"Outrageous!" the deputy chief thundered. "A suspect assaulting officers and vandalizing vehicles! Only drawn firearms subdued him—he's now in holding."

Relieved Guan Yu was accounted for, Xue Jing demanded, "Take me to him."

"Impossible!" he snapped. "This violent felon's under strict confinement. Unless..." His gaze turned predatory. "I could arrange a release...for suitable compensation." His hand groped her shoulder.

Reacting instantly, Xue Jing threw a heavy punch square on his nose—adhering to the principle of striking faces first in confrontations.

"Damn it!" Blood gushed as the deputy chief clutched his face. "You bitch! I'll have you both imprisoned unless you submit!"

Rising in fury, Xue Jing kicked his stomach. "Threaten me? You disgusting vermin!"

The door burst open as a female officer entered—Xiao Lu, whom Xue Jing had earlier asked directions. "What's happening?!"

"Arrest this woman!" the deputy chief howled through bloodied hands.

"Shameless predator!" Xue Jing retorted. "Shouldn't I strike a would-be rapist?"

Xiao Lu instantly grasped the situation. The deputy chief's notorious misconduct made Xue Jing's account credible. However, fearing for her precarious job—obtained through family connections and bribes—Xiao Lu could only mutter apologies and retreat.

"Brainless sow!" the deputy chief raged at Xiao Lu's exit. "Can't even knock properly!"

Meanwhile, Xue Jing confronted her assailant: "Your threats mean nothing. Try touching me again and—"

"Deputy Chief, are you—" Another voice interrupted as Bureau Chief Song appeared downstairs, inquiring through Xiao Lu about his colleague's whereabouts.
