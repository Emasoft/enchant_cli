Feng Xihu said, “Then I won’t disturb you here. Please continue. I’ll take my leave first.”

Without waiting for anyone’s response, Feng Xihu turned and left. As she closed the door behind her, she deliberately glanced back at Guan Yu one last time.

From the moment Feng Xihu had entered, Duan Ruxue had remained silent, quietly observing every move and word exchanged between the two. Her sharp intelligence far exceeded Guan Yu’s expectations. Every gesture and utterance from the visitor had already been meticulously recorded in her mind.

**Chapter 5019: Close Relationship**

Duan Ruxue knew the two indeed hailed from the same place. Their prior acquaintance—and the extraordinary nature of their bond—was evident from the emotions swirling in Feng Xihu’s gaze.

The look Feng Xihu had given Guan Yu overflowed with complex feelings: excitement outweighing joy, affection surpassing resentment. To Duan Ruxue, such a gaze could only mean their shared history held layers of untold stories.

One particular phrase from Feng Xihu’s emotional outburst had piqued Duan Ruxue’s curiosity: “Guan Yu, it’s been so long.”

Though Duan Ruxue had heard the name “Guan Yu” before, she’d never connected it to Wan Hong. The significance of this alias puzzled her, and she resolved to investigate it later.

While it was clear the two had known each other, Duan Ruxue couldn’t discern whether their acquaintance began in their homeland or here. Yet their handshake’s formality convinced her of their shared origins.

After Feng Xihu’s departure, Guan Yu returned to his seat with a bitter smile. “Forgive the spectacle, Younger Sister Ruxue and Elder Duan. I never imagined things would unfold this way... or that it would be *her*.”

“Might you enlighten us?” Duan Ruxue asked. “It’s obvious you two share a past.”

Without hesitation, Guan Yu nodded. “More than mere acquaintances. To put it plainly—we were once lovers. Circumstances and environment prevented us from staying together.”

“Ah, I see. That explains much,” Duan Ruxue acknowledged with a nod.

Guan Yu steered the conversation away from personal matters. Today’s purpose was to discuss Elder Duan’s knowledge of the East Sea.

Elder Duan began, “Young Master Wan Hong, given your closeness with my daughter Ruxue, let’s dispense with formalities. ‘Elder Duan’ sounds stiff to my ears. Please call me Uncle Duan instead.”

“The honor is mine. Uncle Duan,” Guan Yu replied courteously, rising to bow. His impeccable manners reflected the well-bred youth everyone admired.

Elder Duan recognized the young man’s capabilities. Anyone thriving so quickly in the capital’s cutthroat environment was no ordinary person—a fact that motivated his efforts to strengthen their rapport.

“Regarding the East Sea treasure,” Guan Yu cut to the chase, “I understand you possess crucial information.”

“Indeed. As partners, it’s our duty to share useful intelligence.” Elder Duan leaned forward. “My family originated from a coastal settlement called East Sea Town. True to its name, it bordered what we called the East Sea—though whether this matches the legendary East Sea remains unclear.”

“Likely the same. Please elaborate,” Guan Yu urged.

The vagueness surrounding the East Sea’s location troubled him. If easily found, the treasure would’ve been claimed long ago. Yet the East Sea Dragon Pearl and its fabled hoard might not even lie within the sea itself.

Most perplexing was the complete absence of any coastal region bearing the name “East Sea” in modern records—a void Elder Duan might now fill.

“Our so-called East Sea wasn’t an ocean,” Elder Duan revealed, “but an immense lake spanning multiple capital cities. My childhood home nestled on its shores.”

“A lake that vast? It might as well have been a sea!” Guan Yu exclaimed.

“Precisely. In my youth, we fished its waters for sustenance. Then disaster struck, obliterating our town.”

“What catastrophe could erase an entire settlement?” Guan Yu pressed.

**Chapter 5020: Bitter Regrets**

Elder Duan’s tale of resilience impressed Guan Yu. Building a mercantile empire from refugee beginnings in the capital’s ruthless environment spoke volumes about the Duan family’s grit and acumen.

“Maintaining a household is simple; building a dynasty is not,” Guan Yu remarked respectfully. “Your achievements command admiration, Uncle Duan.”

The elder waved off the praise. “You flatter me, Nephew. Your own prowess already rivals mine in youth. Our current grandeur belies decades of struggle—stories no words can fully capture.”

His weary sigh carried the weight of thirty-odd years spent clawing upwards from textile shop apprentices to mercantile royalty. This timeline overlapped with the legendary tale of Martial Alliance Leader Dai Xiaotian—a connection Guan Yu seized.

“Uncle Duan, regarding the East Sea Dragon Pearl once possessed by Qiao Mei Ren—the rumored ‘Princess of East Sea’—were those claims true?”

“Unverified folklore,” Elder Duan admitted. “Most know Dai Xiaotian’s romance with Qiao Mei Ren, but details blur into myth. When our town fell, legends claimed the vortex birthed a monster—Qiao Mei Ren herself, a water demon who sacrificed our home as tribute.

“Later tales say her union with Dai Xiaotian revealed the Dragon Pearl’s dual nature: key to immeasurable wealth and supposedly an immortal artifact. Demons pursued it relentlessly, sparking conflicts that eventually overwhelmed the couple.”

Guan Yu stiffened. “An immortal artifact? But when I held it, I sensed no extraordinary power—only beauty.”

“Mere speculation,” Elder Duan shrugged. “As the treasure myth grew, the artifact angle faded. Yet the Pearl’s allure remains undimmed—hence the current frenzy around it.”

Cold realization dawned on Guan Yu. Had he truly gifted away an immortal treasure? The thought curdled his stomach. Even for Jiang Xin’s ethereal beauty, such generosity now tasted of folly.

“What’s wrong, Nephew?” Elder Duan noted his distraction. “You seem troubled.”

Guan Yu masked his regret. “Merely pondering these tales. That sea monster—was it truly witnessed? Was Qiao Mei Ren actually a demon?”

**Chapter 5021: Childhood Memories**

Elder Duan’s narrative stretched credulity, yet the absence of other survivors left no means of verification. Legends, Guan Yu knew, often bloated with each retelling.

“Our town’s destruction was real,” Elder Duan insisted. “Only Grandfather and I escaped because we’d been weeding distant fields when the skies darkened. A monstrous vortex devoured everything—homes, trees, even the air itself.

“We clung to a boulder as winds howled. Through the sandstorm, I glimpsed the lake’s center—a colossal whirlpool sucking the world into its maw. When the waterspout towered heavenward, we fled until our legs gave out.

“Waking in a forest hamlet, I learned we’d survived. Our proud, isolated community—gone. For years, we wandered until reaching the capital. Starting as cloth-shop apprentices, we scraped and saved until building this...” He gestured at their opulent surroundings.

The story’s raw edges—the childhood terror, decades of toil—resonated with Guan Yu. Here sat living proof that legends often spring from ordinary lives thrust into extraordinary trials.
