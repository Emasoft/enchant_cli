“Brother Du, this is your fault,” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “You’ve utterly wronged her. Some of your words were misguided—you didn’t merely delay her youth, you squandered it. Given that, shouldn’t you take responsibility for her entire life? How can you be such a heartless scoundrel, leaving without a word? Abandoning her alone like that—have you no sense of a man’s duty?”

Having heard the story earlier, Wang Xiao had been furious on the yellow-clad woman’s behalf. Why grieve over such an unfaithful man when there were countless others? Yet Du Teng’s actions were truly inexcusable.

Guan Yu, the calmest among them, spoke evenly. “Brother Du, I too side with the lady in this matter. But I believe you aren’t the villain they paint you as. Your sudden departure must have had reasons—perhaps unavoidable circumstances. Now that you’ve reunited, clarify things properly.”

Guan Yu seemed to have guessed part of the truth. Du Teng hadn’t left out of cruelty, but due to forces beyond his control.

The woman in yellow had finally found Du Teng and understood why he’d left. Having heard much about the Wujian Immortal, she’d pieced together the puzzle. All she wanted now was the truth from Du Teng’s lips—even a simple apology would suffice.

“Du Teng,” she declared, “you abandoned me to challenge the Wujian Immortal at Wujian Manor, didn’t you? You knew it was a suicide mission. That’s why you left that note silently—to make me rebuild my life without mourning your death. Isn’t that right?”

Du Teng stood motionless, head bowed, offering no response. Frustrated, the woman grabbed his sleeve and shook him violently. “You block of wood! Say something!”

*Slap!*

The sharp crack of her palm striking his face echoed through the air. “Speak!” she screamed. “Won’t you even give me an explanation now? I need to know why you left me so cruelly!”

Du Teng remained silent and unresisting as her fists pummeled his chest. The woman’s weeping intensified.

Guan Yu never imagined Du Teng could be so wooden. “Brother Du,” he urged, “standing here mute solves nothing. This must be resolved.”

Wang Xiaorong added, “Yes, Brother Du. Now that she’s found you, explain everything. After all this time, matters should be settled.”

**Chapter 4126: I Cannot Give Up**

Under their persuasion, Du Teng heaved a profound sigh. “Two years ago… leaving you was my only choice. You’re right—after breaking through my cultivation bottleneck, my long-suppressed desire to challenge the Wujian Immortal reawakened. I thought this might be my chance. Knowing the peril, I didn’t want to burden you further. If I died, I wished you to move on unencumbered.”

“Fool!” The woman collapsed to her knees, sobbing. “What life could I have without you? Don’t you know how deeply I love you?” After two agonizing years, she finally heard her lover’s explanation—not rejection, but misguided protection.

Though Du Teng’s actions stemmed from concern, they reeked of cowardice. Abandoning one’s beloved for a doomed duel was no act of courage.

“Brother Du,” Wang Xiaorong said gently, “you thought to spare her pain, but caused greater harm.”

“If I perish challenging the Wujian Immortal, wouldn’t your lifelong grief be worse?” Du Teng countered. “I wanted you free to rebuild.”

His logic was flawed yet not entirely baseless—any choice preserving his challenge would remain wrong. Guan Yu now understood: Du Teng’s earlier claims of having no attachments were lies. This woman anchored his heart.

“Brother Du,” Guan Yu pressed, “you wronged her terribly. She abandoned family and comfort for you. Yet redemption remains possible—renounce this challenge, and find happiness together.”

“Impossible!” Du Teng’s voice hardened. “I’ve prepared years for this. Challenging the Wujian Immortal is my life’s purpose.”

“Then kill me first!” The woman shrieked through tears. “Countless have fallen before the Wujian Immortal. You’d just be another corpse! He’s reigned supreme for decades—what makes you think you’re different?”

“Nothing will deter me,” Du Teng stated. “Even death at Wujian Manor is preferable to lifelong regret.”

As the woman blocked his path, arms spread, Guan Yu intervened: “Brother Du, I don’t question your skill. But why court certain death? Many stronger than you have failed.”

Du Teng sighed. “Last night I told you—this may be my prime. If not now, when?”

“But you’re no loner,” Guan Yu countered. “She stands before you—will you discard shared happiness for suicide?”

Even Wang Xiaorong felt stirred by Guan Yu’s words. The woman wept: “If he cared as you say, he’d never have left.”

**Chapter 4127: I Agree Wholeheartedly**

“Why meaningless?” The woman implored. “You live for me, not some immortal! Am I worth less than your ambition?”

“You’ll thrive without me,” Du Teng insisted.

The stalemate continued—each trying to persuade the other. Guan Yu realized everything hinged on who relented first.

“People don’t live solely for themselves,” Guan Yu reasoned. “When someone becomes your everything, you live for them. Isn’t she worth that?”

Wang Xiaorong nodded. “I’d live for Guan Yu without hesitation. Miss Zhenxiang clearly feels the same. How can you spurn such devotion?”

Du Teng wavered. Decades of martial pursuit versus the woman who’d searched years for him. “Zhenxiang,” he murmured, “if I survive the challenge, I’ll return to you. If not… find happiness anew.”

“How heartless!” She wailed. “My sacrifices mean nothing next to some duel? Is a fight worth more than us?”

“Martial arts are my life’s blood,” Du Teng said bitterly. “Without this purpose, existence holds no meaning.”

Guan Yu made one final plea: “Countless ways exist to prove your skill. Why choose death? Brother Du—with respect—you’re no match for the Wujian Immortal.”

“You’ve never seen him fight,” Du Teng retorted. “What basis have you?”

“This inn teems with masters surpassing you,” Guan Yu pressed. “None dare challenge him. Where’s your prudence?”

“I’m aging,” Du Teng deflected. “Now or never.” Turning to Zhenxiang: “I’ve wronged you, but beg your understanding.”

“I’ll never understand!” She cried. “Having found you, I won’t let you go!”

As tensions escalated, Guan Yu sensed hidden depths. “Brother Du—you know this is suicide. Why persist despite her pleas? You’re no callous man. What aren’t you telling us?”

**Chapter 4128: The Truth Revealed**

Guan Yu’s perceptive words struck home. Zhenxiang clutched Du Teng desperately. “A-Teng! What aren’t you saying?”

The hardened warrior’s voice cracked. “I never wanted to leave… but for your sake, I had to.”

Guan Yu gripped his shoulder. “Unburden yourself, Brother Du. Don’t let love die misunderstood.”

Du Teng’s resolve crumbled. The truth, when it came, would test every bond in the shadow of Wujian Manor’s immortal legend.
