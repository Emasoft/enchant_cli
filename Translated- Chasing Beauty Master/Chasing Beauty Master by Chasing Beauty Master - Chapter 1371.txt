Guan Yu tightly embraced Wang Xiaorong, straining to protect her. As the lake water crashed down, he cursed his inability to safeguard everyone, yet refused to succumb to despair.

He thought bitterly—if only his Eggshell Shield still existed, even mountains of water couldn’t harm them. But such regrets were futile now. Struggling to survive himself, protecting others became impossible. In the end, he could only clutch Wang Xiaorong before darkness swallowed his consciousness.

“Guan Yu! Wake up!” Wang Xiaorong frantically shook his limp body. Minutes passed without response.

Panic rising, she pressed trembling fingers to his nostrils. Relief washed over her—breath still stirred—but why wouldn’t he awaken?

**Chapter 3550: A Familiar Feeling**

Wang Xiaorong surveyed their surroundings: a massive stone platform beneath their feet, an enormous stone gate looming behind. Intricately carved symbols adorned the gate’s surface. “Is this… the Gate of Hell?” she murmured, voice trembling. “Have we died?”

“Cough, cough…” Guan Yu’s spasms sent Wang Xiaorong scrambling to his side. “You’re awake!” she cried, eyes shining. “I called for ages! I was so worried!”

“Where are we?” He blinked at the glittering vault above—countless luminous gemstones embedded in the ceiling cast prismatic light across the platform. Beyond stretched the same lake that had nearly drowned them, its depths now eerily calm.

“The Meng Hua Patriarch’s underground palace?” Guan Yu breathed. The architecture’s grandeur matched legends—polished stonework, that colossal gate. Though still submerged beneath the lake, this clearly wasn’t natural. The crushing currents that battered them must have swept them here.

Wang Xiaorong’s excitement bubbled. “That gate must lead to the Eight-Drum Technique! Let’s hurry!”

**Chapter 3551: I Remember**

The stone gate resisted Guan Yu’s mightiest shove. “It won’t budge! Who builds doors this massive?”

“Perhaps rust sealed it shut?” Wang Xiaorong traced strange triangular sigils carved into the stone. Three meters tall, the gate’s central emblem swirled with cryptic patterns.

Guan Yu slumped against cold stone. “After all we endured… blocked by a door.”

“Don’t despair!” She settled beside him. “Fate brought us here. There must be a way.”

As hours slipped by, frustration mounted. “We should leave,” Guan Yu finally said. “No food, weakening strength—”

“Abandon the Eight-Drum Technique? Your sect ordered this!”

“I never wanted it!” he snapped. “Your father’s ambitions dragged us here. The Demonic Lord’s greed endangers everyone!”

Wang Xiaorong stiffened. “We act true to ourselves—unlike your hypocritical ‘righteous’ sects!”

**Chapter 3552: Not Impressed**

Her finger suddenly froze on a weathered carving. “This pattern… the Blackblood Mountains! The Blood Lord’s cavern had this same symbol!”

Recognition dawned. “The indentation—it’s shaped for the Burning Heaven Furnace!”

Guan Yu’s hand flew to his pouch. Though rumors claimed his sect confiscated the artifact, the miniature furnace still rested within.

“You kept it!” Wang Xiaorong gasped. “But your Azure Cloud Sect—”

“Demonic spies infesting my sect couldn’t uncover this.” He smirked, placing the furnace into the gate’s central recess.

The ground quaked as ancient mechanisms groaned. With thunderous resonance, the gate parted—revealing swirling dust veiling secrets untouched for millennia.

Wang Xiaorong whispered in awe, “To think… what our ancestors considered mere keys, we revere as divine artifacts.”

Guan Yu’s laughter held bitterness. “Humanity’s endless folly—fighting over scraps from greater ages.” Arm raised against the billowing grit, he stepped into history’s shadowed heart.
