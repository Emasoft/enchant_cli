Here is the translated text adhering strictly to all specified rules:

“While Guan Yu was giving some instructions earlier, Chu Hong had been watching him the whole time, though her true intentions remained unclear. Guan Yu couldn’t be bothered to expend energy probing her thoughts.

Giggle...

Covering her mouth with delicate fingers, Chu Hong exhaled a fragrant breath as she murmured, “Younger brother is certainly handsome. Don’t forget you’re treating me to dinner tonight.”

“Dining with a beauty is an opportunity I’d never pass up.” Guan Yu extended his right hand with gentlemanly grace.

Chapter 599: The Thorny Rose

The casino Chu Hong operated combined gambling, entertainment, dining, and lodging into one integrated establishment.

She led Guan Yu to the seventh floor, reserved a private dining room, and ordered several exquisite dishes accompanied by a bottle of 1982 Lafite.

Throughout the meal, they conversed like new acquaintances—laughter interspersed with casual remarks gradually building rapport. What hidden agendas they harbored while finishing this dinner remained known only to themselves.

As the meal concluded, Chu Hong pleaded lightheadedness from the alcohol, having Guan Yu escort her to a room on the seventeenth floor.

Whether Chu Hong was truly intoxicated, Guan Yu couldn’t say. But he knew well that without his treatment system neutralizing the alcohol, their roles might have been reversed—they’d consumed three bottles between them, with Chu Hong drinking more.

Upon entering the room, Guan Yu flushed with embarrassment. His alcohol tolerance wasn’t newly acquired, yet here he was.

Chu Hong’s arm draped over his shoulders, her head resting against him. Her proud peaks deliberately yet casually brushed against his chest—that paradoxical blend of firmness and softness. Though intimately familiar with such sensations, each encounter brought novel thrills. Perhaps this was the eternal allure of intimacy.

With a low chuckle, Guan Yu gripped Chu Hong’s slender waist, carrying her to the bed.

Now her arms encircled his neck, faces nearly touching. Her orchid-scented breath warmed his skin as snowy décolletage filled his vision. The flimsy black evening gown might as well have been invisible against her skin.

Any heterosexual man would react physically to this sight.

As an experienced lover, Guan Yu found his defenses crumbling faster—the more seasoned, the weaker the resistance.

Observing the growing tent below his waist, Guan Yu smiled wryly. He’d thought himself immune to temptation, yet here he stood defeated.

Pressed against Guan Yu’s shoulder, feeling that rigid presence at her abdomen, Chu Hong’s lips curled in a faint smirk.

After steadying his breathing, Guan Yu continued lowering her onto the bed.

Though he could have simply dropped her, what man could handle such a natural seductress roughly? Gentleness became inevitable.

His back nearly bent at ninety degrees before her form fully settled on the mattress.

Glancing down, the snow-white vista of overflowing cleavage and fragrant valley left him intoxicated.

At this moment, Chu Hong moaned softly. Her dazed eyes fluttered as she squirmed slightly—Guan Yu lost balance, tumbling down with her.

The springy mattress bounced their entangled bodies like actors in an erotic film. His throbbing member met her softness, nearly drawing out cries of pleasure.

With Chu Hong’s arms still around his neck, his face became buried between her peaks.

His accelerated heartbeat pulsed against Chu Hong’s abdomen—she felt each rapid thud distinctly.

No man escapes my grasp, Chu Hong thought triumphantly.

Thus, despite recognizing her calculated seduction, Guan Yu surrendered.

Face embraced by voluptuous softness—practice indeed proved truth’s only test. Without firsthand experience, none could comprehend the springiness rivaling the mattress itself.

Pulse racing, blood surging, Guan Yu suffered from his swelling lower half.

Long he struggled without escape.

As the saying goes: When life assaults you, if resistance fails, embrace the pleasure. Guan Yu yielded completely.

Just as he prepared to indulge, Chu Hong twisted free, releasing his neck.

Guan Yu slid behind her, both now lying side-by-side on the expansive bed.

He exhaled deeply—partly from suffocation.

Silence reigned until Guan Yu’s senses cleared, revealing Chu Hong’s subtle breathing.

Asleep? Guan Yu doubted it. Since she sought to entice him, he’d play along—determined to uncover what medicine these schemers brewed, deploying even honey traps.

Undeniably, Chu Hong’s form drove men mad.

From behind, the tailored gown outlined her demonic curves—the perfectly rounded derrière exuded primal allure.

A peculiar smile touched Guan Yu’s lips as his formerly restrained hands grew bold.

He shifted to create maneuvering space.

His right hand found her exposed back—the gown’s designer had bared swathes of skin for maximum allure.

Upon contact, Chu Hong shivered faintly. Guan Yu noted her tension.

Wasn’t she famed as a social butterfly? Shouldn’t this come naturally? Why the nervousness? Were rumors false? Had none touched her before?

This thought intensified Guan Yu’s strange smile.

His fingers traced her infant-soft skin down the spine.

Her body tensed further—his diagnostic system detected microscopic tremors.

Aha! His conjecture proved correct—she was untouched.

Alternatively, some grew intensely excited during passion, their tremors indicating heightened desire.

If rumors held, Chu Hong belonged here.

But as an experienced lover, Guan Yu discerned virgin’s nerves from arousal’s tremors.

He knew with absolute certainty—Chu Hong’s body remained unexplored territory.

Chapter 602: Mantis, Cicada, and Oriole

Zhou Jin’s strategic mind paired with ruthless efficiency.

Having resolved to eliminate Guan Yu swiftly, he’d spare no effort erasing the man from Earth.

Chu Hong started, a nerve struck. “Wasn’t Guan Yu assigned to me? Why change plans?”

“We lack time,” Zhou Jin stated. “Though you’ve bedded him, your new acquaintance leaves him guarded. Waiting for lowered defenses risks exposure. I won’t allow that.”

Chu Hong darkened. “You distrust me?”

“Our enemy’s strength permits no errors,” Zhou Jin countered. “Violence brings complications but ensures speed. Failed assassinations breed opportunities—we await his inevitable lapse.”

“But failed attempts heighten his vigilance!” Chu Hong argued.

Zhou Jin frowned. “You seem reluctant to see him dead quickly.”

Chu Hong paled, steadying herself. “I merely want his suffering prolonged.”

“Great achievements demand sacrificed scruples. Forget unpleasantness.” Zhou Jin sighed.

“Guan Yu’s alertness guarantees your approach will fail. Leave this to me.”

“The matter’s settled.” Zhou Jin’s tone turned imperious, his smile chilling. “Even the vigilant drop guard—say, during bedplay.”

His glance at Chu Hong made her pupils constrict, face bloodless yet expressionless.

“Meeting adjourned.” Zhou Jin waved dismissal, then added, “Yang Long, remain. We’ve details to discuss.”

Chu Hong blanched further. Exclusion from strategy sessions—unprecedented. Under dim lights, none noticed her distress, not even Zhou Jin.

Decisions traditionally involved all three leaders. Today’s exclusion chilled Chu Hong’s eyes. She exited impassively.

Returning home, Chu Hong sat staring blankly before smashing a glass against the wall.

The shattered fragments mirrored her self-image—useful vessel when needed, shattered discard when spent.

Zhou Jin exploited Guan Yu’s weakness—women. A man’s most vulnerable moment: mid-coitus. Success rates soared when targets anticipated pleasure, not bullets.

Thus Chu Hong became the perfect bedmate-bait. Only through her could Zhou Jin track Guan Yu’s movements for optimal strikes—likely during climax.

Zhou Jin’s controlling nature might install hidden cameras for precision.

Unacceptable! Worst was her role as sacrificial pawn—caught in crossfire during the assassination.

Bullets showed no mercy. To maximize success, Zhou Jin would sacrifice her without hesitation.

Her exclusion from planning confirmed this. Earlier seduction assignments merely paved way for this end—her body as trap, their coupling as kill-zone.

All unfolded per Zhou Jin’s designs.

Ha!

“Zhou Jin, worthy of your ‘Strategist Prince’ title—playing the long game magnificently!” Chu Hong laughed maniacally, hurling objects wildly.

Decades of composure shattered. Guan Yu’s words resurfaced:

Pathetic. Pitiable.

Suddenly—cold clarity.

“Guan Yu must have discovered my identity.” Chu Hong muttered. “No—Zhou Jin’s too.”

During the gambling match, Guan Yu’s seemingly casual glances at Zhou Jin suggested recognition.

This realization magnified—she’d underestimated the youth.

His cunning defied his years. She intuited their years-long conspiracy crumbling by his hands.

But what mattered now? A sacrificial piece gains nothing from enlightenment.

She wouldn’t warn Zhou Jin, just as she’d hidden bedroom details. Perhaps for revenge—this self-deception felt incomplete.

The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. But who was mantis, who prey, who predator? Chu Hong’s mind churned chaotically.

Chapter 603: Cannon Fodder

Secret Meeting Room No.1

Yang Long faced Zhou Jin across the table.

Though more brawn than brain, Yang Long frowned. “Excluding Chu Hong—wise?”

“Let her brood,” Zhou Jin sneered. “I suspect divided loyalties.”

“What?!” Yang Long stood abruptly.

“Merely suspicion. Her recent behavior unsettles me.”

Yang Long eyed him. “Do you doubt me too?”

“Absolute allies don’t exist—only shared interests bind us. You I trust.” Zhou Jin smiled.

“Then why distrust Chu Hong...” Yang Long’s knotted brows showed confusion.

“Men chase wealth, women, power. Women want more. Hence her unreliability. Your new task...”

“Which is?”

“Find an ally to eliminate Guan Yu.” Deadly intent flashed in Zhou Jin’s eyes.

“Who?” Yang Long brightened.

“Ma De.”

“The fatso who clashed with Guan Yu?”

Zhou Jin nodded. “His pettiness matches his girth. Chu Hong provoked their conflict to approach Guan Yu, burning bridges with Ma De. He’ll seek vengeance—perfect cannon fodder. Let him charge ahead while you reap rewards.”
