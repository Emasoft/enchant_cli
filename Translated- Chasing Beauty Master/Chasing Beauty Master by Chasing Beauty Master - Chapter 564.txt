Guan Yu remained silent, while Bika Cat beside him nodded with a smile.

"Hehe, it actually sounds quite nice. By the way, they don't seem hostile. Why won't you meet them, Dragon Brother?"

"I can't explain it clearly. I've grown increasingly fond of quiet lately. Too much noise disturbs my peace."

"Boss, you've been a Magus for so many days. Why haven't you shown signs of breaking through?"

Bika Cat's remark made Guan Yu realize something. Due to the Crystal Toad within him, his magical cultivation and comprehension far surpassed ordinary people. He had progressed rapidly since first contacting magic, transforming from novice to Magus within half a year, joining the ranks of elite experts in Lanmei Continent.

Yet Guan Yu's ambitions stretched further. He needed continuous breakthroughs to secure his foothold in this fiercely competitive land. Ordinary people couldn't achieve such feats in mere months - what took him half a year might take others lifetimes.

"After handling current affairs, I'll find a remote cave for seclusion and breakthrough."

"But what should we do now?"

Guan Yu glanced downstairs at the lingering crowd and sighed. "I only hope the War Wolf Mercenary Corps sends someone quickly. Whether for battle or truce, let them decide swiftly. I can't bear staying here longer."

As his words faded, distant screams pierced the air. "What's happening? What mischief now?"

Bika Cat leaped to the windowsill. "Boss, remember what you just said?"

Chapter 1428: Lang Tianming

"What did I say?"

"That wish about War Wolf Mercenary Corps coming quickly. They've truly arrived!"

Guan Yu started - prolonged exposure to Bika Cat had made him a jinx. But there was no time for complaints. The pressing matter was confronting the aggressive mercenaries.

"Amy, stay inside. Bika Cat, with me!"

"No! I'm coming too!"

Guan Yu glared. "You want to go everywhere! Do you know how terrifying werewolves are? They devour people alive, tearing flesh from bone!"

"Ah! Dragon Brother, stop! I'll stay! I'll stay!" Amy covered her ears, face pale.

"Since you don't want to hear, I'll stop. But obey me - stay put. If I find you missing later, punishment awaits." With that, Guan Yu leaped through the window, Bika Cat following.

Landing on the opposite rooftop, Guan Yu surveyed hundreds of meters ahead where dozens of brown-clad figures approached. Leading them was a middle-aged man flanked by four youths - two males including the familiar Lang Tianhua and Lang Duhua, and two females.

The werewolf contingent halted before the scattering villagers. "Don't flee! Didn't Mayor Bade say we have Dragon-Cat Hero? We needn't fear werewolves!"

Though shouted loudly, the words proved ineffective. Only the boldest paused. "Where's Mayor Bade? Fetch the Dragon-Cat Hero!"

"Mayor Bade? He was here moments ago! Where'd he vanish?"

The crowd searched until Xiaowei found him hiding in a teahouse. "Mayor! Why hide here? The villagers need leadership!"

"Ahem! I'm not hiding! I sought quiet to summon our guards!" Bade produced a blue talisman - his invention for emergencies. Chanting spells, he shouted "Break!"

With a boom, the talisman ignited into ashes. "The summoning is sent. Guards will arrive shortly. Check outside while I fetch Master Guan Yu." Before objections, Bade darted out, leaving confused villagers.

In truth, Bade hid in a more secluded room. The duped Xiaowei ran outside to find empty streets - the crowd had retreated 300 meters away. Though still recovering, Xiaowei sprinted toward them, yesterday's horrific memories fueling his flight.

At the halfway point, whooshing sounds approached. Nearing the crowd, a dark shadow flashed - Xiaowei's vision darkened as sinister laughter rang. Before him stood Lang Tianming.

"Run! Why stop?" Lang Tianming sneered. Xiaowei panted heavily, accepting his fate.

"Mortals have tough lives. Thought you died yesterday tumbling down the mountain. Pity your luck - escaping one disaster only to meet another. Let me end your miserable existence."

The crowd watched helplessly. Against werewolves' power and missing leadership, none dared intervene.

"Fiend! Cease your cruelty!"

At Xiaowei's darkest moment, a voice thundered. Between them appeared a dozen silver-armored guards - Bade's summoned Steel Guards. Though average in offense, their full-body armor promised strong defense.

Seeing these protectors, Xiaowei regained hope.

"Haha! Reinforcements? Let's test their mettle!"

"Dare mock Steel Guards? Witness our might!" A guard charged, fist slamming toward Lang Tianming who leaned forward invitingly.

The punch sparked dazzling flames on impact - the crowd gasped. Only collision between hard objects produced sparks, yet Lang Tianming's flesh achieved this!

"How?!"

The stunned guard watched as comrades attacked simultaneously. Seven armored figures lunged at the unarmed werewolf.

Clangs echoed before they scattered like bowling pins. Within minutes, the "indestructible" guards lay battered.

Xiaowei despaired. "Leave me! Don't sacrifice yourselves!"

"Xiaowei, Steel Guards exist to protect villagers in crisis. Fleeing would shame us before our people!"

Comparing this bravery to Bade's cowardice, Xiaowei's heart chilled. "Then let's face this villain together! If death comes, we meet it standing!"

Touched yet unmoved, Lang Tianming chuckled. "Pathetic human sentiments. I only wanted one life, yet you deliver many!"

As he advanced, dark energy swirled in his palm. Chanting strange words, he cast an air-net ensnaring Xiaowei's group. Struggles only tightened the bonds.

"Rise!" The net levitated - one meter, two, three... Ten meters high, the crowd gasped. From such height, survival was impossible.

"Beg and I'll stop." Lang Tianming taunted.

"Never! Death before pleading to scum!" Xiaowei spat.

"Life's precious, but dignity more! We won't degrade ourselves!" a guard declared.

"Madmen all! Since you seek death..." The net ascended further.

"Can't we save them?"

"Save them? With what? We're no match!"

"Where's Dragon-Cat Hero? Our supposed savior?"

"Savior? He fled seeing real danger! Just a passerby humoring fools!"

"You criticize, yet cower here! At least Master Guan saved someone last night! What have you done?"

As arguments erupted, someone pointed skyward. "Look! What's that?"

"Dragon-Cat Hero! Our savior arrives!"

All looked up to see a black silhouette on a rooftop - a young man with a cat perched shoulder. The familiar, reassuring sight of their protector.

Chapter 1430: A Mage Opponent?

Sensing powerful aura behind him, Lang Tianming turned to see Guan Yu observing the floating captives.

"So you're Guan Yu? Let's test your power!" Lang Tianming's palm glowed violet, energy blade sharpening as the air-net constricted tighter.

"Boss, he's provoking you," Bika Cat remarked.

"Indeed. His energy control matches Lang Tianhua's. War Wolf Mercenary Corps breeds formidable foes." Guan Yu's eyes narrowed to slits, murderous intent awakening.
