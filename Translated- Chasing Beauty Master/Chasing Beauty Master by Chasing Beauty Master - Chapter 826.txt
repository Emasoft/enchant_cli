“Could the proprietress be a hidden expert?” Guan Yu wondered. Normally, an ordinary woman would struggle to react when faced with a sudden lunge from an attacker. Yet not only had the proprietress reacted swiftly, she had even grabbed a dish to hurl at the man.

The proprietress must be a cultivation expert whose level Guan Yu couldn’t discern. There were only two possible explanations: either her cultivation far surpassed his, or she practiced an unorthodox method, akin to someone like Jin Hua.

The world held many extraordinary individuals, some capable of devising their own cultivation techniques. Their inner qi differed from ordinary cultivators. By conventional logic, a higher-level cultivator could discern another’s cultivation level through focused observation.

Yet those who practiced unique or unconventional methods remained inscrutable. The proprietress exemplified this. Guan Yu couldn’t gauge her cultivation—either she surpassed him, or her inner qi followed an unorthodox path.

Still, confusion lingered. Given Guan Yu’s abilities, even against someone with an exotic technique, he should have sensed fluctuations in her inner qi. Yet his scrutiny revealed nothing—the proprietress’s body showed no trace of qi movement.

Though Guan Yu currently wielded the strength of a Second-Class Venerable, his true foundation lay at the Peak Realm Venerable level. Anyone below that threshold should be transparent to his perception.

**Chapter 3015: Public Humiliation**

Yet Guan Yu remained puzzled. Even accounting for an exotic technique, he should have detected some inner qi resonance. But his examination confirmed the proprietress had none.

Her cultivation likely didn’t exceed the Peak Realm Venerable tier. She must practice a rare method. No wonder Pan Taisheng had intervened earlier, only for the proprietress to rebuff him. Given the situation, Guan Yu needn’t step in—she could handle Baldy herself.

Her strength wasn’t lacking; she merely concealed it.

Baldy, seeing his two subordinates incapacitated, roared and charged forward, brandishing a machete seemingly conjured from nowhere. He swung at the proprietress without an ounce of mercy.

“That bastard! How dare he slash at such a beauty with a machete? What if he ruins her?” Pan Taisheng fumed, rising to intervene.

Guan Yu stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. “Relax. She’ll be fine.”

As predicted, the proprietress nimbly dodged the strike. The machete cleaved air as she sidestepped, seized another dish, and smashed it onto Baldy’s head.

Patrons, eager to aid without provoking Baldy’s gang, had lined their tables with dishes for her convenience. The proprietress swayed slightly during the evasion—a feint, Guan Yu knew. Such crude attacks couldn’t touch her.

Pan Taisheng’s initial anxiety eased. As a cultivator himself, he now recognized the proprietress’s capability.

Baldy stood with a dish clinging to his scalp, vegetables draping like a grotesque wig. Oil dripped down his face, drawing stifled laughter from the crowd. Even Qing Linger covered her mouth to hide giggles.

Humiliation ignited Baldy’s rage. With a bestial roar, he drew a pistol from his waistband and aimed it at the proprietress. Her triumphant smirk froze—no cultivator outran bullets.

The room fell deathly silent. Guan Yu’s brow furrowed. A gun changed everything. Pan Taisheng mirrored his alarm.

“You bitch!” Baldy spat. “Apologize now and strip naked in front of everyone, or I’ll let you taste lead!”

Past desire for conquest, Baldy sought mutual humiliation. Making her disrobe publicly seemed fitting retribution.

Some pitied the proprietress; others leered in anticipation. Yet she stood defiant, chest thrust forward. “Why should I obey you? Shoot if you dare!”

“You—” Baldy’s gun hand trembled. “Fine! I’ll blow your brains out!” As his finger tightened on the trigger, Guan Yu rose with a thunderous “Halt!”

His voice, infused with qi, enveloped the room. The oppressive aura pinned everyone in place. Baldy’s arm sagged as if weighted by stones, forcing the gun downward.

Guan Yu approached calmly. “Greetings. I’m Guan Yu.” He retrieved the pistol and placed it back in Baldy’s shaking hand. “Careful—firearms are unpredictable. And illegal.” His smile chilled Baldy to the core.

“Y-yes! My mistake! I shouldn’t have—” Baldy stammered, legs quaking under Guan Yu’s crushing aura.

“Inform Hui Ge I’ll pay double protection fees soon. But if anyone troubles this establishment again…” Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. “Leave. Now.”

Baldy fled with his men. The crowd murmured approval at Guan Yu’s deft resolution.

“Who said you could let them go?” The proprietress’s voice rang out. “They wrecked my shop! And who authorized double payments?”

Qing Linger stood indignantly. “Ungrateful wench! He saved you!”

Guan Yu raised a placating hand. “Had Baldy fired, bystanders could’ve been hit. Your business would’ve ended in lawsuits.”

“And my damages?” the proprietress retorted. “That door costs money! Are you their lackey?”

Guan Yu sighed. “Fighting a local gang is unwise. Consider the door a minor loss.”

“Minor? Pay up!”

Exasperated, Guan Yu tossed bills on the table. “Keep the change. Let’s go.”

As they turned to leave, the proprietress demanded, “Stop! You owe compensation!”

Qing Linger whirled. “Madwoman! We’re paying for your rudeness?”

Guan Yu massaged his temples. “How much?”

“Why should—” Qing Linger began, but Guan Yu cut her off. “Arguing won’t help.”

**Chapter 3016: Unreasonable Demands**

The proprietress remained fixated on Guan Yu. “You let them escape. You pay.”

Qing Linger fumed. “You’re insane!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Name your price.”

**Chapter 3017: Too Stubborn**

“Compensate my losses,” the proprietress insisted.

Qing Linger glared. “After saving you, this is your thanks?”

Guan Yu shook his head. To the proprietress: “How much?”

“Five thousand!”

Qing Linger gasped. “Robbery!”

Guan Yu withdrew a wad of bills. “Done.” He turned away, the proprietress’s voice chasing him: “Wait! You—”

“Enough,” Guan Yu said without looking back. “Some battles aren’t worth fighting.”

As they exited, Qing Linger muttered, “That woman’s possessed.”

Pan Taisheng chuckled. “Maybe she fancied you, Guan Yu.”

“Unlikely,” Guan Yu said. “Let’s find a quieter place to eat.”

Behind them, the proprietress watched, lips curving in a cryptic smile.
