“At this point, the other party finally realized what Lin Chen intended. Even without explicit mention, they understood he wanted them to assist him in gambling.

‘Aren’t the two of you partners in deception? Then return now with this silver and win me two hundred taels. Otherwise, I’ll expose your schemes to everyone,’ Lin Chen declared coldly.

The man protested, ‘This won’t work. We’re always monitored during work. If caught, we’ll be ruined!’ His refusal was resolute, as though death itself wouldn’t sway him.

The thin woman interjected, ‘Besides, our shift has ended. Returning now would raise suspicion. Could we wait until tomorrow morning? Perhaps we truly could help you win then.’

Lin Chen frowned. Time was scarce. Delaying until dawn risked creditors hunting him down. ‘No. It must be now. This is your only chance. Refuse, and face the consequences,’ he snapped.

‘Killing us changes nothing!’ the woman retorted defiantly. ‘New dealers and shills have taken over. Even if we returned, we couldn’t win for you. Surely you understand that?’

Lin Chen paused. Her logic was sound. Pressuring them further seemed futile. Calculating swiftly, he asked, ‘What time do you arrive tomorrow?’

‘At daybreak. The casino opens early, bustling with patrons. If you wait, we’ll help you win then,’ the woman offered.

Reluctantly, Lin Chen acquiesced. ‘Very well. But if you fail to appear, I’ll ensure your ruin.’ With a final glare, he departed, hoping his borrowed silver wouldn’t be discovered.

Privately, he plotted: even if successful tomorrow, he had no intention of repaying debts. Once gone, who could pursue him?

After Lin Chen left, the thin woman exchanged a glance with her companion. ‘Shall we truly aid him?’

The man smirked. ‘Let him taste his own poison. We’ll collaborate subtly to bleed him dry. Without evidence, he’ll have no recourse.’

Realization dawned on the woman. ‘Indeed! He holds no proof. Why fear his threats?’

Their scheme solidified: by morning, any evidence would vanish. Denial would be effortless.

Blind to their machinations, Lin Chen returned jubilant. ‘Fortune favors me!’ he crowed, emptying his purse in reckless gambling. By midnight, every coin was lost.

‘No matter,’ he muttered. ‘Tomorrow’s winnings will replenish all.’ Retiring early, he left camel-purchasing duties to companions Aze and Wang Jun.

At first light, Lin Chen hurried downstairs, only to find the casino deserted. Cursing, he spotted the silver-lending beauty from yesterday entering a back room. Seizing opportunity, he followed.

Knocking lightly, he announced, ‘Such an early start, fair lady? Might I share your company?’ Without waiting, he entered.

The woman—Zou Xiaoyu—smiled politely despite his intrusion. ‘Lost your silver again, Young Master Lin?’

‘Not at all!’ he lied smoothly. ‘My steward will settle debts this afternoon. Until then…’ He leaned closer. ‘Might I know your name?’

‘I am Zou Xiaoyu (Little Fish),’ she replied, continuing her account books.

‘A name as refreshing as sea breeze!’ Lin Chen praised. ‘Join me for breakfast?’

‘My meals are prepared elsewhere,’ she declined. ‘But feel free to wait.’

As Lin Chen turned to leave, two burly men entered. Recognizing debt collectors, he feigned calm.

‘You’re Lin Lingsu?’ one demanded.

‘You mistake me,’ Lin Chen bluffed, edging toward escape.

‘False name. False address. Repay two hundred taels now,’ they countered, flanking him.

Lin Chen gripped his Yunqing Sword. ‘Touch me, and face consequences!’

‘The casino’s reputation matters,’ they growled. ‘Pay or suffer.’

‘My steward comes this afternoon!’ Lin Chen insisted, though sweat beaded his brow. Escape plans unraveled as the men closed in.

Chapter 4376: Captured

Upstairs, Ling Su snored obliviously. Lin Chen roused him roughly. ‘We leave now! Meet at West Gate!’ Grabbing his pack, he rifled through Ling Su’s belongings—finding no silver—and fled.

Too late. The collectors blocked his exit downstairs.

‘Lin Lingsu. False identity. Repay immediately.’

‘Absurd!’ Lin Chen brandished his sword. ‘I am Lin Chen, guest here! Harass me again, and—’

‘Your room fees are unpaid too,’ they interrupted. ‘Two hundred taels. Now.’

Panicking, Lin Chen lunged—but the men moved faster. Seizing his arms, they twisted the sword away.

‘To the debtors’ cell with him!’

As they dragged him out, Lin Chen’s grand schemes crumbled. The heavens, it seemed, had withdrawn their favor.
