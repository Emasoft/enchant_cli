“How could you forget this?” Guan Yu rolled his eyes repeatedly, gaining a new understanding of Du Xiaojuan. What a silly girl—perhaps "Little Daydreamer" would suit her better from now on.

"Washing feet, washing butts..." Guan Yu grunted in agreement, his voice muffled.

PS: This chapter flowed exceptionally smoothly. I couldn't help chuckling while writing. Even I've fallen completely for Du Xiaojuan's character—so utterly endearing! What do you brothers think? Isn't she the most adorable girl?

Chapter 191: Gambling on Stones in Yunnan

Early the next morning, Guan Yu got up and took Niu Le and Du Xiaojuan from home straight to Aunt Luo's residence. After deciding last night to leave Du Xiaojuan with Aunt Luo, Guan Yu had already called Luo Cheng to arrange everything. Now Luo Cheng should be waiting for the trio at home.

Driving the car they'd won, they reached the building where Aunt Luo lived before the morning traffic police started their shifts.

Du Xiaojuan resembled an abandoned puppy since dawn, reverting to her sullen demeanor. Pouting with no trace of a smile on her delicate face, her large eyes kept darting toward Guan Yu, brimming with reluctance.

Seeing her state, Guan Yu understood perfectly. He comforted her, "It's alright. You'll be back soon! I'll call you whenever I can, okay?"

"Mmm... I'm fine," Du Xiaojuan forced a smile, her small hand clutching Guan Yu's sleeve tightly.

After explaining the situation to Aunt Luo's family, Luo Cheng and Xiao Si accompanied Guan Yu downstairs. They drove the Land Rover to send Guan Yu and Niu Le straight to the airport for their 11:40 AM flight to Yunnan.

At the airport, after completing check-in procedures, Guan Yu and Niu Le waited in the departure lounge—wide-eyed first-time flyers. During security screening, seeing others surrender lighters, Guan Yu suddenly slapped his forehead.

"Damn... Hold the security check! Let's go!" He urgently pulled Niu Le's arm.

"What's wrong? We're almost up next!" Niu Le blinked in confusion.

Guan Yu yanked the canvas bag from Niu Le's shoulder. "You think we can board with this? Forget it. Let's find storage."

After storing the bag at a luggage depot, they passed through security empty-handed. Their 11:40 flight finally taxied for takeoff after two hours of delays—standard domestic flight unpredictability.

During ascent, Guan Yu's throat tightened watching buildings shrink below. Even with his gravity manipulation and healing abilities, a crash at this height would render everything useless. Only when piercing through clouds did he relax—at this altitude, worry became futile.

Their six-hour flight landed at Mangshi Airport past 7 PM. Unfamiliar with nighttime safety in the border city of Ruili, Guan Yu opted to stay at an airport hotel.

Clueless about jade gambling, Guan Yu relied entirely on his clairvoyant detection skill. Unlike seasoned experts with hard-won experience, he could directly peer into stones—an unfair advantage where "not even immortals could predict jade."

Next morning, they stocked up on chocolates and took a two-hour bus to Ruili. The tropical scenery—wooden stilt houses and banana groves—felt worlds away from Nanjing.

At the bustling gambling market, vendors hawked stones like vegetables. Unlike professionals with headlamps and UV lights, Guan Yu and Niu Le stood empty-handed.

"Young man, authentic Laokeng goods from Hpakant!" A vendor beckoned. Guan Yu activated his detection while pretending to browse. After scanning dozens of stones, he finally found a basketball-sized black rock containing fist-sized emerald green jade—worth at least three million conservatively.

"How much?" Guan Yu casually asked.

"450,000," the vendor said dismissively.

"Expensive? Think I can't afford it?" Guan Yu retorted theatrically. After haggling to 400,000, nearby observers shook their heads—an overpriced gamble.

As money changed hands, a middle-aged spectator murmured, "That parched Hpakant material... too risky even at 300,000." His assistant suggested watching the cutting.

With the stone secured, Niu Le carried the thirty-kilogram load effortlessly. Guan Yu's heart raced—this could be their golden ticket or expensive lesson. The true test would come at the cutting wheel.
