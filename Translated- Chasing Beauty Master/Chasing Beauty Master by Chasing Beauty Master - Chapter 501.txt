Guan Yu didn't know where her confidence came from, but since he remained completely ignorant of Xia Yue'er's background, he temporarily clung to this last shred of hope.

As the two emerged from the jewelry shop and prepared to return to their inn, a provocative voice suddenly rang out: "Hey beautiful! Stick with our boss! He's rolling in cash!"

Guan Yu and Xia Yue'er turned to see three street thugs standing five or six meters ahead. Their entire demeanor exuded the aura of petty ruffians.

When the pair remained silent, the hoodlums mistook their quiet for fear and continued jeering: "Look at that penniless twig beside you! Skinny, broke, dressed like beggared trash – what a waste standing next to a pretty thing like you!"

"Quit hesitating, sweetcheeks! Come give big brother a hug!"

One thug began advancing toward Xia Yue'er, but he'd barely taken two steps when his movement froze – a deceptively slender hand had locked around his throat like an iron vise.

"Y-you... let our boss go! Or... or we'll make you pay!" The remaining two thugs shouted hoarsely, yet neither dared approach. None had seen Guan Yu move – his speed existed beyond their comprehension.

"Well? Still think I'm shabby?" Guan Yu's grip tightened as the choking leader's face purpled. The thug lacked strength to struggle, let alone retort. Survival instincts honed through street life dictated immediate submission.

Seeing the head thug's frantic headshake, Guan Yu gradually loosened his hold. Being new to this town, he preferred avoiding bloodshed for now – these vermin weren't worth killing over trivial offenses.

The remaining two immediately dropped to their knees, kowtowing as they pleaded: "Milord! Spare us! We're victims too! We swear never to do this again!"

Guan Yu's brows furrowed. "Victims? Harassing decent women in broad daylight and still playing victims? Think I'm blind?!"

"Truly milord! Our main trade's robbery! Flirting's just... just a side hustle..." Had the situation been less dire, Guan Yu might have laughed aloud. Since when did street thugs have primary and secondary occupations?

"Spare the semantics!" He barked. "How's robbery and harassment make you victims? Explain clearly now, or none of you leave alive!"

"Mercy! We'll talk! It's... the Murong Family..."

At these words, Guan Yu's memory flashed to half a month prior – camping in the forest with Rossi, Amy, and Kelly, encountering those peculiar Murong Family members: an elder, a youth, and their attendants.

Chapter 1269: Investigating the Murong Mansion

According to Allen's intel, the Murong Clan had grown arrogant and tyrannical after currying favor with the imperial Qin Family. They were also reportedly involved in searching for the Crystal Toad.

"Extracting Murong intel from these rats might aid our plans." With this thought, Guan Yu seized the thug's collar again. "Start talking. Every detail about the Murong Family. Miss one word and I'll sever an arm!"

The thugs nearly wept. Had they known this youth's terrifying prowess, ten lifetimes wouldn't have made them rob him – let alone harass his woman.

But regret held no currency here. Their only hope lay in obediently divulging every Murong secret.

From their trembling accounts, Guan Yu learned the Murong Clan boasted hundreds of members, over a hundred combatants. Among these, less than twenty were Intermediate Swordsmen, five Advanced Swordsmen. The true threat was Patriarch Murong Hai – reaching Great Swordsman rank over a decade ago, now likely at its peak.

Having grasped magical truths, Guan Yu felt newfound confidence. His Nascent Soul from another world enhanced physical combat, while newly learned magic handled ranged attacks.

Though individual Advanced Swordsmen posed little threat, five together could prove troublesome. Combined with Murong Hai's Great Swordsman prowess and the clan's imperial backing... Guan Yu resolved to avoid direct confrontation during the Crystal Toad heist, reserving force as last resort.

After obtaining this intelligence, Guan Yu barked: "Scram! Let me catch you causing trouble again..."

The thugs kowtowed furiously. "Thank you for sparing us, milord!" They scrambled backward, only to freeze when Xia Yue'er suddenly shouted: "Wait! Nobody moves!"

As the trio quaked in terror – fearing Guan Yu's change of heart – the girl rushed over and began rummaging through their pockets. Disappointment colored her voice: "Tch! Only three hundred gold? Thought you big shots carried more! Get lost before I change my mind!"

Watching Xia Yue'er rob the robbers, Guan Yu stifled laughter. These thugs likely never imagined being robbed themselves. Perhaps this humiliation would deter future crimes.

Returning to their inn at nightfall, Guan Yu prepared to bathe and rest before the midnight operation. He'd barely removed his shirt when Xia Yue'er barged in.

"Oops... forgot to knock again!" She averted her eyes from his bare torso, cheeks flushing.

With her hair cascading like black silk and sleep-softened features, Xia Yue'er exuded an indescribable charm. Guan Yu sighed – at least he still wore pants. "What's so urgent? Shouldn't you be asleep?"

"I wanted to ask – are you visiting the Murong Mansion tonight?"

Guan Yu's jaw dropped. How could she possibly know? He'd never mentioned this plan – it remained half-formed in his mind!

This revelation made him reassess the eccentric girl. "Who are you? How did you...?"

"Details later! I swear I mean no harm. Just wake me when you go. Yaaawn... goodnight!" She vanished before he could respond, leaving Guan Yu clutching his half-removed shirt. "This mission just got more interesting," he mused.

Hours later, knocking interrupted his doze. "Yu-ge! Time to go!"

Grumbling, Guan Yu dressed and opened the door to find Xia Yue'er in form-fitting black gear that accentuated her curves. Under the nearly-full moon, they navigated alleys toward the Murong compound.

After half an hour, they reached an illuminated estate – unquestionably the Murong Mansion. In Jinzhou City's hierarchy, the Murongs ruled as de facto lords, their authority unchallenged.

Perched on a neighboring roof, they observed the palatial complex. "Typical," Guan Yu sneered. "Nobles flaunting wealth through imperial connections. But your reign ends tonight."

"Yu-ge," Xia Yue'er whispered unusually seriously. "Don't freak out, but... are you here for the Crystal Toad?"

Though prepared, Guan Yu still startled. "You're full of surprises! Yes. Don't tell me you...?"

"Not interested," she shrugged. "But watching everyone scramble for it sounds fun!"

"This isn't a game! Blood will flow when that treasure appears. You could get hurt!"

"Pfft! I can handle myself. Besides, escaping's my specialty!"

Her cocky grin reminded Guan Yu of their first meeting – chased through streets. Did she enjoy being pursued?

"Hush!" Xia Yue'er suddenly pointed. Armored guards patrolled below – visored helmets, gleaming swords. They ducked until the squad passed.

"Security rivaling the palace," Guan Yu noted.

"Please," Xia Yue'er scoffed. "My home's guards are stricter!" She clapped a hand over her mouth, then giggled: "Kidding!"

As another patrol approached, Guan Yu groaned. "We'll wait till dawn at this rate. Need a distraction."

"Easy!" Before he could stop her, Xia Yue'er hurled a roof tile behind the guards. The shattering echo brought instant alarm.

"Intruders! Search the area!" As guards rushed toward the noise, she tugged Guan Yu: "Move!"

They leapt down, barely dodging returning patrols by hiding behind pillars. "Check everywhere! Kill on sight!" barked the captain.

Once clear, Xia Yue'er pointed excitedly: "Look! That pavilion!"

A multicolored lantern-lit structure floated serenely on a lake, connected by a wooden bridge. The two-level pavilion's upper chamber glowed invitingly.

"Perfect for romantic trysts," Guan Yu smirked.

"I want to live here!" Xia Yue'er sighed.

"Focus!" He hissed. A faint thump came from above. "Someone's inside."

"Could be Murong Hai! Let's capture him for info!"

"You realize he's a Great Swordsman?"

"Scared?" She teased. "Doesn't suit you!"

Though exasperated, Guan Yu admitted her plan had merit. "Stay silent and follow my lead!"

They leapt onto the roof. Peering through tile gaps, Guan Yu abruptly jerked back – nearly getting a nosebleed.

"Perv! Peeping at bathers!" Xia Yue'er hissed after looking.

Guan Yu flushed. Who bathed at midnight? Below, an exquisite woman lounged in a marble tub, steam curling around her jade-like skin...
