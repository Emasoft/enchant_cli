“There’s nothing for you to apologize about in this matter. I wouldn’t want Yang Conghan to follow my brother either. I actually know what kind of person my brother is…” Feng Xihu’s voice trailed off, her words faltering.

Guanyu asked again, “Does your family truly possess that Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm? What exactly is it?”

Feng Xihu glanced at Guanyu. She was an exceptionally intelligent girl and seemed to have already guessed his intentions. However, since she no longer involved herself in family affairs, she replied indifferently, “I’ve only seen the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm once, when my grandfather showed it to me as a child. He said it was the eternal symbol of the Feng family’s resilience, our heirloom. But now, I truly don’t know where it’s kept.

“To be honest, I know you’ve always wanted to obtain it—even everyone in the Feng family knows. But this matter… I really can’t help you.”

Guanyu understood that Feng Xihu’s words now indicated she had taken a neutral stance between him and the Feng family, unwilling to aid either side. He sighed, “I’m just desperate to regain my strength. I believe the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm is actually a Realm Sovereign’s Relic. If I could obtain it, once I recover my power, I wouldn’t fear retaliation from those people anymore.”

Feng Xihu took a small sip of coffee. “All I can say is that the Feng family does indeed possess the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm. When Grandfather was dying, Father wanted to use it to save him, but Grandfather adamantly refused. He said everyone’s fate is predetermined, and the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm is the Feng family’s treasure, not to be used unless the clan’s survival is at stake. But even if you want it, obtaining it won’t be easy.”

“Let’s discuss this another time. Perhaps there are other ways for me to recover.” Since Feng Xihu couldn’t help, continuing this conversation was pointless.

Feng Xihu’s purpose for meeting Guanyu tonight was simple: to warn him to be cautious, as the retaliation from those people would be terrifying.

After finishing her coffee, Feng Xihu stood to leave when suddenly the room spun violently. Her legs gave out, and she collapsed onto the table, unconscious. Simultaneously, Guanyu felt his internal energy churn wildly, resisting an unknown force.

Though dizzy, Guanyu still retained some strength. He immediately realized what had happened—they’d been poisoned, likely by the young waiter from earlier.

The waiter, thinking he’d succeeded, approached with a lecherous grin. “Such a rare beauty! Hahaha! Tonight will be fun!”

Acting as if Guanyu didn’t exist, he reached for Feng Xihu. Enraged, Guanyu barked, “Take your filthy hands off her!”

“Oh?” The waiter froze, shocked that Guanyu remained conscious despite the drug. “Still awake? Must’ve skimped on the dosage. Note to self: use more next time.”

Guanyu coldly retorted, “Next time? Pray you live to see tomorrow.” Suppressing the poison with his internal energy, he stood slowly.

As the waiter pulled out a golden pistol, Guanyu flicked his wrist. A dagger severed the man’s pinky. Catching the falling gun with his foot, Guanyu aimed it at the howling waiter. “Still think there’ll be a next time?”

“Spare me! I was wrong! Never again!” the man begged in rapid English.

It had been close—Feng Xihu nearly fell victim to this scum. Guanyu, not wanting bloodshed, forced the whimpering man into a corner and used Feng Xihu’s phone to call the police. When no one answered, he photographed the culprit before carrying Feng Xihu to his car.

At the nearly empty police station, an officer saluted upon seeing the photo. “Thank you for your cooperation. We’ll apprehend him immediately.”

Guanyu left hastily—the poison still ravaged his system. Barely making it home, he parked roadside to meditate. When he awoke, dawn had broken. Checking his phone, he found fifty missed calls and texts from Jinhua ranging from worried to furious.

Returning home, Guanyu found Second-to-Wolf and Acai still there. “Brother, didn’t you plan to leave today?”

“With you missing all night? I stayed to protect Jinhua,” Second-to-Wolf smirked. “But bringing another woman home? You’re fueling the fire!”

Jinhua stormed out, feigning anger. “So the great Guanyu finally returns! Leaving me waiting all night while cavorting with— Oh, fine. Let’s check your poison.”

As Jinhua examined Feng Xihu, she suddenly gasped, “She’s pregnant!”

Guanyu nearly choked. “What?! That’s impossible!”

“Relax—joke!” Jinhua laughed before turning serious. “Where did you eat last night? Describe the poisoner.”

Guanyu showed Feng Xihu’s phone photo. Jinhua’s expression darkened. “This toxin leaves… complications. We need to act fast.”
