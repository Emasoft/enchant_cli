“So we can’t confront him head-on. We must wait for an opportunity—when Guan Yu’s defenses are weakest—to strike.” Bill Lin panted urgently, frustration simmering beneath his words. Young Master Feng’s cowardice astonished him; the man seemed utterly broken by Guan Yu’s intimidation.

“Don’t lecture me about ‘opportunities’!” Feng snapped, his voice sharp with bitterness. “Last time at Houyuan Temple, you claimed it was our golden chance. What happened? I nearly lost my life! How dare you bring this up again? Handle Guan Yu yourself if you want. I refuse to be dragged into this mess again.”

With that, Feng turned toward the staircase, pausing to deliver a final warning: “Mark my words—crossing Guan Yu will only bring ruin. That man…he’s not normal. Spend enough time around him, and you’ll realize he’s never once tasted defeat.”

**Chapter 2610: Strategy (Part 1)**

Feng ascended the stairs without another glance, his mind haunted by memories of Feng Xihu. Her parting advice echoed relentlessly: *To ensure the Feng family’s survival—to live long yourself—stay far from Guan Yu. Provoke him, and destruction follows.*

He had heeded her counsel, burying old grudges and avoiding all contact. But Bill Lin’s obsession with Guan Yu’s rumored treasure map reignited temptation. The ill-fated ambush at Houyuan Temple—where Feng’s assembled guards were outmaneuvered, his arms broken, his coffers plundered—had been the final lesson. Now resolved, Feng vowed never to challenge Guan Yu again, even if retaliation came. Resistance was futile; negotiation offered the only sliver of safety.

Upstairs, Feng shut his door, leaving the conspirators below. Bill Lin scoffed, “Ignore that spineless fool! Fear has blinded him, but *we* still burn with purpose. My family’s elite fighters join your forces. Together, we’ll strip Guan Yu to the bone!”

“Exactly!” Fang Su slammed the table. “That bastard extorted millions from my family. I’ll carve him to pieces!”

Sun Xu, freshly discharged from the hospital, clutched Xia Jinhua—his new lover since losing Xie Yulu to Jia Bo. “Guan Yu crippled me for months. This ends now. We’re mortal enemies!” His grip tightened on Xia’s breast, eliciting a sharp cry.

Bill Lin’s gaze drifted, uninterested. Since glimpsing Xue Jing at Houyuan Temple, no woman could stir him. Her image consumed his days and dreams, fueling his obsession to eliminate Guan Yu and claim her.

Investigations into Xue Jing had revealed Qiaoyuan District’s other beauties: Amei, Lü Mei, Zhang Han, Lan Yu, Yang Conghan. Their photographs haunted Bill Lin, sparking feverish delirium. Only Guan Yu’s death could grant him access to this harem.

Present among the plotters was Madam Ji, whose lucrative campus entertainment empire Guan Yu had dismantled. “He ruined me,” she hissed, adjusting her slit skirt to tease Bill Lin. “But with your family’s backing, we’ll crush him.”

**Chapter 2611: Strategy (Part 2)**

“Of course!” Bill Lin boasted, ignoring her advances. “United, we’ll overwhelm Guan Yu’s tricks. Even the Yang family’s auction chaos works in our favor—the city’s turmoil masks our strike.”

Ge Yinglai, flanked by student thugs, urged immediacy: “My men wait outside. Let’s end this tonight!”

“Patience.” Bill Lin outlined his plan. “Guan Yu travels with a formidable female bodyguard. We bait her away first. Snipers failed before, but with our combined forces—Sun’s mercenaries, Fang’s funds, Ji’s connections—we’ll corner him.”

Fang Su nodded. “My sister’s three hundred men—including cultivators—were routed. Numbers mean nothing against his allies and that damned pistol.”

“Then hire more cultivators!” Sun Xu interjected. “Drown him in skilled blades.”

Ji scoffed. “Why complicate? Ambush him with five hundred men. No lone girl stops that tide.”

“You underestimate her.” Bill Lin’s voice turned grim. “At Houyuan Temple, five hundred fell like wheat. Guan Yu exploits every weakness. We need precision—not brute force.”

As debates raged, Feng Xihu’s warning lingered like funeral incense: *Some storms cannot be weathered. Some enemies cannot be fought.* Below his sanctuary, the plotters’ fervor crescendoed—a chorus of vengeance blind to the abyss ahead.

**Chapter 2612: Strategy (Part 3)**

Ge Yinglai’s proposal ignited approval: “Snipers. End him silently.”

“Tried.” Bill Lin’s admission doused enthusiasm. “When foreign traffickers hired hitmen, Guan Yu survived. The man’s luck is supernatural.”

Silence thickened until Ji purred, “Then we become the exception.” Her smile sharpened. “All legends die. Let’s write his ending.”

The conspirators leaned in, their pact sealed in venom and ambition. Outside, shadows lengthened over Feng Manor—a gathering storm unaware of the dragon it sought to slay.
