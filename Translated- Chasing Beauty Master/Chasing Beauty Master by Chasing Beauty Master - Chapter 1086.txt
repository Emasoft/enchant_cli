The waitress offered an apologetic smile before producing a small white slip with machine-printed characters—presumably the woman’s itemized bill.

Though illiterate in many of the words, the numbers at the bottom were unmistakable. “Units, tens, hundreds, thousands… over forty thousand!”

The woman gasped, suddenly realizing a critical oversight. While basic medical treatments like bandaging and IV drips might cost under a hundred yuan in Huaxia, the currency exchange rate here was drastically different.

“Damn it! I only made a hundred thousand today, and two IV drips wiped out nearly half! How am I supposed to survive like this?” she muttered, frantically checking the exchange rate on her phone.

Her jaw dropped. The conversion ratio was outrageous. “One Huaxia yuan equals 0.006 units here? What kind of scam is this?” She counted on her fingers, rage boiling over. “Ten thousand yuan here equals just six hundred back home? After getting battered like that, I only earned six hundred yuan?”

The realization shattered her. She collapsed on the spot, a stark illustration of why some profit while others flounder.

Xue Jing recounted this common pitfall for overseas scam artists. Guan Yu and Lyu Mei listened intently. “That woman’s plight is tragic,” Lyu Mei remarked from the backseat.

“She chose to swindle others. No one pities her—they’d say she deserved it,” Guan Yu stated coldly. “Able-bodied people opting for easy gains should face consequences to learn.”

As he spoke, traffic police arrived. Recognizing the luxury car, one officer’s eyes lit up—a golden opportunity, though fleeting. Under recent orders, they couldn’t harass this vehicle. The officers dragged the elderly fraudster from beneath the car, whispered instructions, and sent her off unscathed.

The woman was a seasoned performer in these parts, colluding with police who took kickbacks. “This car belongs to someone high-ranking. They called the chief directly. Let it go today,” an officer muttered. Nodding, the “injured” grandmother vanished.

Bystanders gaped as the ruse unraveled. Someone had even called an ambulance in vain.

With the crowd dispersed by police signals, Guan Yu drove off. “See? Connections solve problems faster than insurance,” he remarked. Lyu Mei exclaimed, “She walked away fine! It was all an act!”

“The emperor doesn’t fret, but the eunuch does. Now you know better,” Guan Yu retorted, earning an eye-roll. Xue Jing braced for another squabble.

True to form, Lyu Mei fired back: “You hit her! Shouldn’t you check?”

“You jumped to conclusions without seeing the truth,” Guan Yu countered. Their bickering crescendoed until Xue Jing snapped, “Enough!”

The trio eventually arrived at a florist. Guan Yu selected yellow and pink carnations mingled with white roses and baby’s breath—a vibrant bouquet that delighted the women. Unable to resist their glee, he added purple roses and lilies symbolizing eternal love.

The arrangements proved bulkier than expected. “Just order more for the others,” Guan Yu decided, commissioning deliveries to Zhang Han, Amei, Yingzi, Lan Yu, and Yang Conghan. The florist beamed at the windfall.

At the Lyu estate, Wang Shu greeted them warmly. Lyu Mei bounded inside, shoes flying. “Mom! Look what Guan Yu brought you!” she trilled, presenting the flowers.

Yao Yu awaited in the parlor, feigning composure as hostess. Her eyes betrayed eagerness. Guan Yu noted Lyu Mei’s discarded shoes—tossed in her sprint—and exchanged pleasantries with lawyer Liu, who lingered awkwardly.

Discussing the Fang family assets, Guan Yu frowned. “Only five million? I’m inheriting scraps.”

Liu masked disdain. *Who turns up their nose at five million?* His gaze drifted to Lyu Mei and Xue Jing, their beauty igniting darker thoughts. *Such wasted potential on this arrogant fool…*

Guan Yu observed covertly as Liu’s eyes roved—the lawyer’s lust poorly veiled. *A wolf in gentleman’s garb.* He resolved to warn Yao Yu later.

“Mom, Guan Yu’s flowers are gorgeous, right?” Lyu Mei chirped, kneading Yao Yu’s shoulders.

“You’ve been behaving in Qiaoyuan District?” Yao Yu asked Xue Jing.

“She’s been perfect,” Xue Jing assured, though Lyu Mei interjected, “I never cause trouble!”

Liu edged closer, devouring the sight of Lyu Mei’s exposed waist. Guan Yu’s voice snapped his focus: “This foreign TV is impressive.”

“A friend imported it,” Yao Yu replied. “Shall I order you one?”

“No need,” Guan Yu declined, smiling. “But you, Auntie Yao—you look younger every time!”

Lyu Mei snorted. “Mom watches it constantly!”

Yao Yu chided her gently as Guan Yu laughed. “I’m used to her candor.”

Unseen by others, Liu’s fingers twitched with suppressed desire. *Patience,* he told himself. *The payoff comes first.*
