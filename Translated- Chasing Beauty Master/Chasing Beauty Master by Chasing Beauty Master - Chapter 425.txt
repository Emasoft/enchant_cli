“What do you think…” Wen Qing’s words abruptly cut off. Just as Guan Yu wondered what happened, a familiar voice suddenly came through: “Hmph! Damn Guan Yu! If you dare come back, I’ll skin you alive!”

“Xin…Xin-jie?” Guan Yu never expected Feng Xin’s voice to emerge from the phone. “Xin-jie, why are you in the capital? Who else went with you?”

“None of your business! You’ve been enjoying yourself out there every day. Do you even remember us?” Feng Xin’s tone overflowed with resentment, yet Guan Yu felt warmth in his heart. It had truly been too long since he’d seen Xin-jie and the others. Their grievances were understandable.

“Heh, Xin-jie, don’t be angry. When I return, you can punish me however you like.”

“Darling, let me tell you—Xin prepared a TV remote, instant noodles, keyboard, and washboard for you to choose from…” Liu Shilei’s voice chimed in.

“Brother Guan Yu, don’t be afraid! Jing’er will protect you!” Zhao Jing’er’s voice emerged before being interrupted by Mo Ling: “Traitorous brat! Biting the hand that feeds you! Just wait till I deal with you!”

“Aiya! Sister Mo Ling, I won’t dare anymore! Stop! That tickles! Brother, come save me quick!”

As the playful banter continued, Guan Yu’s longing to return home intensified. He was about to chat more with his lovers when an unknown number interrupted. Ignoring it at first, he continued exchanging casual remarks with Wen Qing’s group.

After fifteen minutes of persistent ringing from the unknown caller, Guan Yu frowned and temporarily ended his current call.

Dialing back, he demanded: “Who are you looking for?!”

“Guan Yu, correct? Li Xi, Jiang Yiyi, and Song Xiaoya are in our custody. If you want to see them, come to Daya Bay within an hour.” A gruff voice hung up without allowing questions or refusal.

“Who is this? How do they know about my connections?” Guan Yu’s first thought pointed to retaliation from the Taiwanese Song family—only they knew who accompanied him today.

His immediate priority became verifying the kidnapping. Initially unconcerned—given Li Xi’s bodyguard Lin Dong’s formidable skills—Guan Yu’s blood ran cold upon discovering all their phones were switched off. Lin Dong never turned off his phone.

Panicking, Guan Yu hailed a taxi straight to Daya Bay.

**Chapter 1063: The Storm Strikes**

At Daya Bay’s Imperial Capital Hotel, Guan Yu followed instructions to the penthouse presidential suite. Upon opening the door, a cold gun barrel pressed against his temple.

Remaining calm, Guan Yu scanned the room—two middle-aged men, one youth, and four armed guards. His detection system revealed over a dozen security personnel nearby, though Li Xi and Lin Dong were conspicuously absent.

As both parties sized each other up, the balding central figure spoke: “So you’re Guan Yu? Younger than expected.”

“Flattery noted. Where are my friends?”

“Patience, young man. Let’s discuss cooperation first.” The man lit a cigar.

“Cooperation? What kind?”

“Are you aware both the capital’s Song family and Taiwan’s Song clan want you destroyed?” came the counter-question.

“What’s your meaning?” Guan Yu frowned, reassessing his initial assumption about their allegiances.

Reading his confusion, the man chuckled, signaling the guard to lower his weapon. “Relax—though I share the Li surname, we’re unrelated to the Song-affiliated Li family.”

“Song-affiliated Li family?” Guan Yu’s bewilderment deepened.

“Allow introductions—I’m Li Feng, CEO of Imperial Glory International. This is our chairman Li Qi, and his son Li Xuan, our vice president.” The balding man gestured to his companions. “We invited you for two purposes—to clarify we didn’t take your friends, and to propose collaboration.”

“Explain clearly—who took them and why?” Guan Yu demanded.

Li Xuan interjected: “It’s simple. By provoking both Song factions, you’ve forced them to employ Hong Kong’s most influential force—the Lee family.”

“The Lee family?!” Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. The Lees controlled vast commercial empires across Asia, their patriarch Li Zeya recently making headlines by acquiring half of Britain.

“Precisely. Though only distantly related through marriage to Song cadet branches, they’ve mobilized against you.”

Before Guan Yu could process this, his phone rang—Wen Baoguo reporting ominous developments: suspended duties, political appointees blocked, and corporate investigations.

The coordinated assault extended beyond personal vendettas. Taiwan’s political clout combined with Hong Kong’s economic might created an unstoppable force. Even the influential Dongfang family began crumbling under stock market plunges and political pressures.

**Chapter 1064: Collaborating with the Li Family**

In Dongfang Mu’s study, allies convened—Jiang Ziqi, Wang Dahu—all bearing scars from the economic-political blitzkrieg.

“Big Brother Dongfang, whatever plan you have, we’ll follow!” Wang Dahu urged, his family’s police bureau appointments evaporating overnight.

Dongfang Mu sighed heavily. “This transcends simple rivalry. Guan Yu provoked forces rivaling our family’s strength. Against the combined might of Songs and Lees… we’re outmatched.”

The situation mirrored chess pieces being swept from the board. Wen family collapsed, Liu family betrayed by turncoat relatives, while Guan Yu remained stranded in Hong Kong’s danger zone.

When Guan Yu’s phone finally connected with Dongfang Mu, the exchange was terse—acknowledgment of mutual crises before strategizing shifted to Hong Kong’s battleground.

Back at the hotel suite, Li Xuan pressed: “Well, Guan Yu? Will you collaborate?”

“State your terms.”

“We’ll shield you from Lee family strikes. In return, secure our mainland foothold post-crisis.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Why me? Can your ‘Imperial Glory’ truly counter Li Zeya?”

Li Xuan smiled thinly. “Though smaller than Zeya Enterprises, we hold Southeast Asian influence. Help us penetrate China, and we’ll divert Lee family’s attention.”

Negotiations crystallized—Guan Yu’s future pharmaceutical ventures would gain Southeast Asian channels through Li family networks. Though currently unprofitable, Guan Yu envisioned herbal medicine’s regional potential.

“Then we’re agreed.” Li Xuan extended a hand, adding: “Our initial… test… was necessary. Partners must prove their mettle.”

Guan Yu’s glare lingered on the retreated gunman. “Let this be the last ‘test’.”

As strategies solidified, both parties understood—this alliance marked merely the opening gambit in a high-stakes game spanning continents and dynasties.
