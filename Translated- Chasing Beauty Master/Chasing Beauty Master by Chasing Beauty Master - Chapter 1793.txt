Chief Zheng glanced sideways at Xiao Zhi, his expression seeming to say, "Hear that? When I stopped you from going earlier, you threw a fit. Now you see how well I've treated you, eh?"

Xiao Zhi retorted unconcernedly, "When I wanted to go, it was precisely to train alongside you and Guan Yu. I knew even if dangers arose, you'd find solutions. I heard about that storm you encountered – if not for your quick thinking, more people would've died!"

"You wouldn't have returned alive! Spouting nonsense now! Keeping you back was the wisest choice I've ever made." Chief Zheng pointed irritably at his son.

"Father, you don't understand. Even if others faced danger or death, as long as they're Guan Yu's friends, I believe they'd be safe. I trusted him completely – that's why I wanted to go!" Xiao Zhi argued fervently, as if describing some celestial being.

Chief Zheng naturally wouldn't allow himself to lose face before outsiders, especially in front of his own son. Were there no spectators, he wouldn't bother arguing at all.

"All empty words! In that ferocious storm, death could claim you in an instant. Who could guarantee your safety?" Chief Zheng snapped.

Guan Yu and Wang Jun silently observed the father-son dispute, curious to see who'd emerge victorious.

Xiao Zhi pressed on, "I told you – Guan Yu's friends and family never face harm. Look at Wang Jun, his close companion, and Siqi – neither encountered danger. As for others... well, that's different."

"Then there's Senior Brothers Lin Chen and Ling Su. They've opposed Guan Yu since Cloudgreen Sect days. See what's become of them now? That's the price of opposing Guan Yu!" Xiao Zhi spoke without restraint.

Guan Yu grimaced, hastily clarifying, "Xiao Zhi, your words harm me! You can't phrase it like that!" His expression soured, knowing if such talk reached Patriarch Xuanming's ears, unpredictable consequences might follow.

"They brought it upon themselves – has nothing to do with me! Your words make it seem like I orchestrated their downfall!" Though aware of Xiao Zhi's blunt nature and lack of malice, Guan Yu knew such statements could be twisted by malicious ears, potentially blaming him for all casualties.

"I meant no harm, Guan Yu. Just stating facts." Xiao Zhi remained unrepentant, circling back to his original point.

Wang Jun watched amusedly. Everyone understood Xiao Zhi's implication: Those aligned with Guan Yu prospered; his opponents met ruin. Simply put – Guan Yu's exceptional capabilities.

Chief Zheng grasped the meaning too, though doubted Guan Yu's near-mythical portrayal. Despite being dual-cultivated in magic and martial arts, his skills remained immature.

"Even at his peak, Guan Yu's merely human! Can he battle weather itself? In deserts where dangers lurk everywhere, a moment's lapse costs lives!" Chief Zheng jabbed a finger at his son.

"Then I say more would survive with Guan Yu present! Even if he can't stop disasters, his wisdom finds solutions. Without him, complete annihilation!" Xiao Zhi countered.

Nodding reluctantly, Chief Zheng conceded, "On that I can't argue. Guan Yu does possess extraordinary abilities, always devising solutions before crises strike. That's his strength."

As Xiao Zhi prepared another retort, Guan Yu intervened calmly, "Master Zheng speaks true. Our survival was pure luck – perhaps I've always been fortunate. The desert's no place for outsiders ignorant of its ways."

"Take our entry to Miao City through the portal. None anticipated arriving at different locations despite entering together. Such things lie beyond my control."

Wang Jun chimed in, "Exactly! Xiao Zhi, you were right to stay. I nearly died!"

"Really? With Guan Yu around, even Siqi felt safe. What frightened you?" Xiao Zhi asked curiously.

"Didn't you hear? In Miao City, we appeared separately. Siqi lucked out staying with Guan Yu." Wang Jun explained.

Guan Yu suddenly recalled, "Now that you mention it – I held Siqi's hand through the portal and never let go. Maybe physical contact keeps people together? Should we all hold hands next time?"

"Who are you asking? How should I know?" Wang Jun rolled his eyes. "Want to test it next Ghost Festival?"

Guan Yu chuckled bitterly, "Let's pass. That wretched place – nothing but beasts and shape-shifters. Never again."

Chief Zheng listened intently from his seat. Xiao Zhi inquired, "Guan Yu, what's Miao City truly like? I regret missing it. They say it's a demon realm city – all dangers and hellish environment?"

"Only half true," Guan Yu explained. "Dangers abound, but Miao City's environment is paradoxically beautiful – lush mountains, singing birds, fragrant flowers. Yet everything's enlarged: towering trees, grass over two meters tall, gigantic beasts. We encountered a boar five meters long!"

Xiao Zhi gaped in astonishment, finding the description more fascinating than frightening. His regret deepened.

"If there's chance next year, I must see Miao City! You make me want to go now!"

"Save your breath," Chief Zheng cut in. "I'll never permit such danger."

Dismissing his father, Xiao Zhi turned to Wang Jun: "Where did you appear? Why the near-death experience?"

Wang Jun shuddered recalling the shapeshifter whose head morphed into a giant toad's, nearly stopping his heart.

"I landed near the city center. Curious about architecture, I approached what I thought were humans. When they transformed... I barely escaped crawling! Later found Guan Yu's group – else..." He trailed off, still haunted.

Chief Zheng queried, "Do the shape-shifters attack unprovoked? Couldn't you blend in?"

Guan Yu answered, "They don't attack unless detected. Higher cultivators see through disguises. Wang Jun's mistake exposed him – hence the scare."

"Miao City's truly paradisiacal," Wang Jun added. "A mountain blooming with fragrant flowers – if not for the inhabitants, perfect."

This triggered Chief Zheng's memory: "When flowers bloom on Divine Stone Mountain, fragrant winds carry far – divine arts manifest. Finding such a mountain should've led you to the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. The clues were clear!"

He grew thoughtful. "The Sect Master suspects something amiss. Guan Yu – has he questioned you again?"

"Not since my rest period. No disturbances." Guan Yu feigned ignorance.

"Afterwards, the Sect Master gathered us leaders. We believe someone obtained the technique unknowingly. At Tigerpeak Hall, he secretly checked your meridians – found nothing."

"Why suspect this? We witnessed no discoveries – not even traces." Guan Yu played along.

Wang Jun confirmed: "We found nothing – not a shadow of the technique!"

Chief Zheng pressed, "The flower mountain's fragrance – 'when fragrant winds carry far, divine arts appear.' Clear indication!"

"We followed that clue," Guan Yu explained. "Tracked the scent to where Red Lotus Sect and Demon Soul Sect fought. The waterfall cave we found connected to Miao City's forbidden center – surrounded by shape-shifters, we barely retreated alive."

"Logically, the technique should've appeared," Chief Zheng mused. "Miao City's emergence and clues aligned with Meng Hua Ancestor's design. Its absence defies reason."

"Yet reality shows nothing," Wang Jun insisted.

Guan Yu speculated, "Perhaps Meng Hua Ancestor never hid it there. Maybe the chaos itself was his goal – pitting orthodox and demonic factions against each other."

Chief Zheng's eyes narrowed. "Possible. Even the next clue might be false. The capital will soon swarm with seekers. Let's hope for truth this time."
