At this moment, Xiaochun on the stage launched a second attack. The commotion finally drew the attention of the Juhe Peak disciples back to the duel.

This time, Xiaochun's assault differed completely from her previous move. She vertically raised her Yunqing Sword with her left hand while rapidly forming hand seals with her right. Spiritual energy visibly coalesced around her shifting gestures before being channeled into the blade.

Though less visually spectacular than her earlier technique, everyone could sense this attack's potency matched if not surpassed the previous strike.

Aze knew continuing passive defense would lead to defeat. Lower-grade defensive spells required higher spiritual energy expenditure than offensive techniques of equivalent level. Prolonged stalemate would drain him faster - an untenable situation.

The young cultivator's expression hardened. Adopting a horse stance, he gripped his Yunqing Sword tightly while chanting incantations at lightning speed. Soon, a pale golden aura enveloped his body. Releasing his sword, the blade hovered and rotated before him as he clasped hands in prayer-like concentration.

Both combatants now stood poised like drawn bows. The audience held their breath, sensing this clash would decide the match.

Twin shouts echoed as techniques unleashed simultaneously. Aze's sword shot forth like a wild stallion while Xiaochun's blade emitted a white mist-like energy. The opposing forces collided midair with thunderous impact.

**Chapter 3286: Ill Temper**

"BOOM!" A shockwave obliterated wooden decorations at the arena's edge. When the dust cleared, both combatants stood unscathed - robes undisturbed by the cataclysm.

Aze cupped his hands respectfully. "Well fought, Junior Sister Xiaochun. Your cultivation impresses this humble one."

"Defeat is defeat." Xiaochun turned to leave. "My thanks for Senior Brother Aze's mercy in combat."

Xiao Zhi scratched his head in confusion. "They look evenly matched. Why concede? Did sparks fly during their clash?"

The mystery solved itself when everyone noticed Aze's sword lying where Xiaochun had stood. Though his technique had penetrated her defenses, he'd stayed his blade from striking. Her gracious withdrawal acknowledged both the technical victory and his restraint.

"Aze! Magnificent!" Xiao Zhi cheered as officials announced: "Victory goes to Xuanshong Peak's Aze! Prepare well for tomorrow's matches!"

While Xuanshong disciples celebrated, Juhe Peak's female cultivators burned with humiliation. A portly matron stormed over, jabbing a finger at Xiao Zhi. "Who're you calling 'elder sister', you impudent whelp?"

Xiao Zhi grimaced. The woman's squat frame resembled a grain jar, her fair complexion betrayed by crow's feet and aged hands. *She's at least forty. 'Elder sister' was charitable - 'auntie' would be more accurate,* he thought, wisely keeping silent.

"Apologize now!" another disciple shrilled. "You Xuanshong men think you can insult Juhe Peak?"

Xiao Zhi raised placating hands. "A misunderstanding! That wasn't me! If you'll excuse-"

"Stay!" The matron blocked his path. "Your whole sect will apologize!"

As tensions peaked, cheers erupted nearby: "Siqi won! Siqi triumphed!" The Juhe disciples immediately abandoned their quarrel to greet their champion.

"Let's go!" Aze urged. "Before that harpy returns!"

Xiao Zhi hesitated, yearning to glimpse Siqi. The legendary beauty stood surrounded by admirers, her frosty elegance contrasting with her junior Xiaotong's sunny disposition.

"Prioritize tomorrow's matches," Aze insisted. "You'll see her another time."

Reluctantly agreeing, the Xuanshong group retreated. That evening, as disciples gathered around tournament brackets, Guan Yu encountered Xiaotong near the announcement boards.

"Come to check your next opponent?" The cheerful maiden smiled. "Perhaps we'll cross blades tomorrow."

Guan Yu chuckled. "I'd rather not face you. Doubtless I'd lose."

Their friendly banter drew envious glares. Unbeknownst to them, whispers spread: "That philanderer! First Siqi, now Xiaotong! Does he want all Juhe's flowers?"

**Chapter 3287: No Room for Error**

Meanwhile, Elder Dai inspected Siqi. "No complications against Qianhui Peak?"

"Senior Sister ended it in two minutes!" a disciple gushed. "Her opponent flew from the arena!"

"Rest well," Elder Dai nodded. "Tomorrow permits no errors."

As moonlight bathed the sect, strategic discussions continued in hushed tones. For every visible clash of steel, hidden currents of rivalry and attraction swirled beneath - the true drama behind any cultivation tournament.
