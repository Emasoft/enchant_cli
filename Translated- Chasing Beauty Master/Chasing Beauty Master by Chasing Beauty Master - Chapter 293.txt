“There was a momentary illusion—the person sitting across from her wasn’t some brash young man, but a lion, fierce and ambitious, decisive in slaughter and conquest.

After calming her emotions, Zhang Yi finally spoke, “I don’t know what you did to Wan Qianshan, but the reality now is that you’ve only tentatively gained control over him. No one knows what he truly intends. The risks remain, and the Mo family might not take this gamble.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. Zhang Yi had relented, meaning the chips he’d tossed out held significant allure.

As for not understanding Wan Qianshan’s true motives? Guan Yu’s lips curled into a dangerous smirk. Did he *really* not know? Of course not. But he’d naturally keep his异能 (special ability)—to read others’ thoughts—hidden from Zhang Yi.

“Give me one year,” Guan Yu said solemnly.

Zhang Yi fell silent, deep in thought.

Guan Yu pressed on, “A year isn’t long. By then, you’ll see whether I can prove my worth. You’re Mo Ling’s mother. Don’t you want her to freely pursue happiness? If you force her, you might lose not just a political alliance but your daughter too.”

Zhang Yi’s expression shifted, remembering her daughter’s stubborn gaze, a bitter taste in her heart.

“I know you can’t decide this alone,” Guan Yu said, rising. “But I hope you’ll reconsider. I’ll take my leave now.”

This time, Zhang Yi didn’t stop him. She watched him leave, her eyes lingering with an unreadable emotion.

“That young man is extraordinary,” she murmured, sighing, then left.

Zhang Yi’s visit spurred Guan Yu to accelerate his plans. Luo Cheng busied himself consolidating power in N City and L City. Once stable, Guan Yu would head to Taiwan to resolve Wan Qianshan’s lingering threats.

For now, Guan Yu enjoyed campus life—until Feng Xin’s final treatment arrived.

In a room with Feng Xin and her grandfather, Guan宇 spoke gravely, “Today, your scars will vanish completely. You’ll look even more beautiful.”

Feng Xin nodded eagerly, her face already restored to radiant perfection.

Feng LaoYe chuckled, “If Xin’s scars aren’t fully healed, you’ll have to take responsibility for her life.”

After the old man left, tension hung thick.

“Turn around!” Feng Xin ordered.

“But I need to see—”

“Now!”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu obeyed. But through his探查系统 (probing system), he *observed* her undressing—white shirt slipping off, revealing creamy shoulders and curves.

Guan宇’s throat tightened.

When Feng Xin’s shirt half-slipped, he spun back instinctively.

“You—!” she gasped, torn between anger and a strange thrill.

“Don’t move. I’m treating you!” Guan宇 snapped, focusing on massaging her feet, sweat beading his brow.

As his hands traveled upward, Feng Xin’s breath hitched.

“Remove your bra,” he muttered hoarsely. “Such beauty shouldn’t be marred.”

Her cheeks burned, but she complied, heart racing as his hands neared forbidden territories.

“Don’t…*ah*…don’t stop,” she breathed, lost in the paradoxical agony and ecstasy.

Guan宇’s resolve wavered, torn between duty and desire.

In the end, professionalism won.

But not without cost.
