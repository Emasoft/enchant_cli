When Du Xiaojuan recognized the woman who had suddenly burst into the room, she couldn't help exclaiming, “Sister Mo Ling! Why are you here? Didn’t Guan Yu take you home last night? Why are you only wearing a bra?”

“Guan Yu?” Mo Ling looked bewildered. She vaguely remembered drinking too much the previous night and leaving the bar heartbroken after Guan Yu’s harsh remarks. Everything after that was a blur until she woke up surrounded by these four women.

Glancing down at her pink bra and hastily pulled-on pants, Mo Ling’s face flushed crimson. She hurried back to the bedroom—only to freeze at the sight of Guan Yu still asleep on the bed.

Her startled scream drew the four women into the room, their own gasps echoing hers.

Guan Yu blinked groggily at the row of women staring down at him with mixed expressions. “Mo Ling, you’re awake? Wait, why are you all here? Is it time for class?”

His eyes widened when he noticed Mo Ling’s state of undress. “Why are you only wearing a bra?!”

“Shameless!”

“Disgusting!”

“Guan Yu! How could you do this to Sister Mo Ling?!”

“Brother, what did you do to this sister?!”

Guan Yu’s expression turned strained. This was exactly the misunderstanding he’d hoped to avoid by sneaking out before anyone woke. But after enduring a sleepless night of torment, he’d dozed off at dawn—and now faced the consequences.

“You’ve got it all wrong,” he sighed. “I didn’t do anything to Mo Ling.”

Mo Ling’s face burned hotter as she realized she felt no physical discomfort. If Guan Yu hadn’t touched her... why was her top missing?

Only Zhao Jing'er showed a flicker of belief. The other three women radiated skepticism.

Wen Qing gave him a reproachful look. “Husband, if you wanted to stray, you should’ve done it discreetly. Bringing her home so brazenly was wrong.”

“I...” Guan Yu choked on his words.

“Husband?!” Mo Ling gaped at Wen Qing. Wasn’t Du Xiaojuan supposed to be Guan Yu’s girlfriend? How many women did this man have? Her face darkened with disgust. “You’re despicable. I misjudged you.”

Grabbing her clothes, she stormed out—her parting words pouring fuel on the fire.

Du Xiaojuan’s eyes welled with tears as she stared at Guan Yu, wounded innocence radiating from her gaze. He’d taken other women but repeatedly rejected her advances. The injustice cut deep.

“Can’t you see I’m fully dressed?” Guan Yu snapped at the group. “How could I have done anything?”

“Then why was Mo Ling topless?” Wen Qing demanded.

“She sleepwalks.”

He spoke truthfully. During their previous hotel stay, she’d mistakenly accused him of peeking while she used the bathroom—another sleepwalking episode where she’d removed her pants. Now it was her top.

“And how would you know her sleeping habits?” Wen Qing pressed.

Guan Yu hesitated. Admitting they’d shared a bed before would only worsen things.

“Fine, I’ll believe you didn’t cross the final line with her,” Wen Qing relented with a teasing smile.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Her phrasing implied he’d done everything short of the ultimate act.

Feng Xin adopted her authoritative tone. “Guan Yu. Confess how many other women you’re entangled with.”

He clenched his jaw. Answering would only invite more trouble.

“Mo Ling got drunk at the bar last night,” he finally exploded. “Too late to return to campus dorms, sick with a cold—I brought her here. Nothing happened. Believe what you want!”

Brushing past them, he stormed out. Dealing with these women required firmness, not reason.

After hurriedly washing up, Guan Yu wandered the streets aimlessly until a call interrupted his brooding.

“Hello?”

“Guan Yu,” came Fang Zhe’s voice. “Old Commander Zhao approved your request. Your friend will be released today.”

“Really?!” Elation surged through him. He hadn’t expected Commander Zhao to prioritize his appeal. “Thank you, Uncle Fang! Please convey my gratitude to the Commander.”

“We’re family—no need for formalities. Though the Commander misses Jing'er. Bring her to visit sometime.”

“Of course. My apologies for the oversight.”

As the call ended, Guan Yu hailed a taxi to the detention center, school forgotten.

In cell 334, officers barked, “Xiao Xiong! Step out.”

The man complied, resignation weighing his steps—until they led him to the exit instead of a prison van.

“You’re free,” an officer said, removing his shackles.

Xiao Xiong stared dumbfounded at the open gates—then at the familiar figure waiting outside. Memories surfaced of their jailhouse conversation. He’d dismissed the man’s promise of freedom as empty talk.

“Brother Xiao,” Guan Yu smiled. “Congratulations.”

“Thank you.” The words emerged stiffly from the former gang leader.

Guan Yu waved off the formality. “We’re sworn brothers. Let’s get you cleaned up.”

At the villa, Xiao Xiong noted the four distinct sets of toiletries in the lavish bathroom. Emerging refreshed, he smirked. “You’ve got quite the harem, brother.”

Guan Yu played innocent. “What do you mean?”

Xiao Xiong gestured at the bathroom. “Since when do bachelors need four women’s skincare regimens?”

Guan Yu flushed. “Lunchtime?”

Over fine liquor at a luxury restaurant—owned by Feng Xin’s syndicate—Xiao Xiong grew solemn. “My Modest Triumph Group and the Dragon Tiger Gang are yours. I’ll serve as your right hand.”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “You earned those through blood and sweat. I can’t accept.”

“A man’s word is unbreakable.”

“I’m just a student,” Guan Yu protested. “Your men would never accept me. Your empire would crumble.”

Xiao Xiong conceded the point but offered a compromise: “Then remain the shadow commander. The Dragon Tiger Gang answers to you through me.”

Silence hung as Guan Yu weighed the power against his conscience. With enemies lurking, he needed this strength—but at what cost?

Xiao Xiong studied the conflicted youth. This mysterious benefactor who’d sprung him from jail through military connections... What other secrets did he hold?
