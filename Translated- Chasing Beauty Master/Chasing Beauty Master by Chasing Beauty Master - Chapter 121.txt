“They actually plan to use a honey trap on Guan Yu! This is utterly unacceptable!” Liu Shilei thought anxiously. She was already troubled by Guan Yu’s entanglement with Du Xiaojuan. If he joined that film crew and met Gao Wei, what if he developed new feelings?

Though Liu Shilei doubted anything would happen between Guan Yu and the superstar Gao Wei, a woman’s heart naturally recoils at the thought of her lover mingling with other women—especially beautiful ones.

Despite her confidence in her own looks, Liu Shilei knew Gao Wei’s charm was undeniable. That petite woman radiated allure, possessed a heavenly voice, and boasted peerless beauty. Few men could resist her. No wonder Gao Wei had become the dream lover of men nationwide, across all ages.

Even as a woman, Liu Shilei felt deeply moved by Gao Wei’s singing.

“This... seems even more unsuitable. Guan Yu has just started his freshman year. He knows nothing about film crew affairs. He’s unqualified for such a role,” Liu Shilei protested hurriedly.

“Teacher Liu, that’s unfair! With Guan Yu’s intelligence, he’ll adapt quickly. Besides, our student council president is highly sought after by production teams. I doubt he’d refuse such an opportunity.”

Liu Shilei bit her lip, struggling to find another excuse.

“I still think we should discuss this with Guan Yu first. The principal should respect his decision,” she said stiffly.

The veteran principal smiled amiably. “Of course. Let’s hear Guan Yu’s thoughts. Please fetch him, Teacher Liu.”

Defeated, Liu Shilei nodded and left the office, burdened by worry. The principal was determined to thrust Guan Yu into this precarious position!

Ten minutes later, Liu Shilei relayed the principal’s proposal to Guan Yu in the hallway.

“You shouldn’t agree to this. It’s—”

“This sounds amazing!” Guan Yu exclaimed, eyes sparkling.

Liu Shilei glared. “Are you naive or pretending? This ‘opportunity’ is a trap! The student council deals with complex backgrounds and external gangs that even the school can’t control. They’re using you as a pawn!” Her voice rose sharply.

“Troublemakers?” Guan Yu shrugged. “If I become president, no gang will dare step foot here!”

“And how will you stop them?”

“Trust me, I’ve got this. In N City, my word carries weight.”

She pinched his arm. “I forbid you to accept! No discussion!”

Guan Yu sighed pitifully. “Why stop me? Handling troublemakers is my specialty!”

Seeing his confidence, Liu Shilei wavered. Could he really manage?

But she hardened her resolve. “If you take this role, the school will assign you to intern with an external film crew. That’s where Gao Wei’s involved. You’d only go for her, wouldn’t you?”

Guan Yu’s initial excitement about the student council’s freedom crumbled at the internship demand. “Work for free? They can beg me first!”

“Then refuse it all!” Liu Shilei urged.

Relieved by his stance, she softened. “The principal wants to see you.”

As Guan Yu stormed to the office, he resolved to negotiate from strength. Minutes later, he emerged grinning—the principal had dangled Gao Wei as bait.

“This internship isn’t bad! That jade pop star... good exposure!” Guan Yu mused.

The principal winked. “Chase Gao Wei, and our school’s reputation will soar! You’re our best candidate.”

After securing permission to discipline unruly students—with school-funded medical bills—Guan Yu accepted the presidency.

Returning triumphantly, he faced Liu Shilei’s wrath. “You’re just after that star!” she accused, stomping his foot.

Guilty silence confirmed her suspicion.

**Chapter 296: You’re Just After the Big Star**

After lengthy excuses, Liu Shilei snapped, “Get out! I can’t stand you!”

Guan Yu cheekily asked, “Moving in together tonight?”

“So I can watch you flirt with Du Xiaojuan?” She threw a book at him.

“I miss you. It’d be convenient...”

“Convenient for what?” she retorted, blushing.

“Your jealousy proves you care.”

“Bite me!”

He offered his arm. She sank her teeth in, tears falling.

“I’ll stay away,” she said bitterly. “No one wins this way.”

“But where will we... privately meet?” he whispered.

**Chapter 297: Find a Place, Get a Room**

“Pervert!” she spat. “Get a hotel if you’re desperate!”

Guan Yu grinned. “Tonight, then?”

Her book missed as he ducked out, laughter echoing.
