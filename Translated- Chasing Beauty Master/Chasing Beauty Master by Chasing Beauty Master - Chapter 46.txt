The office was empty, as classes had already begun on the first day of the semester. All the teachers had gone to their respective classrooms, leaving the staff room in complete silence.

Supporting Liu Shilei's body as she sat at her desk, Guan Yu urgently studied her face. "Sister Shilei, how are you feeling?"

"I... feel nauseous and dizzy..." Liu Shilei's voice trembled, her eyes flashing with panic. It really was a venomous snake bite—were the toxins taking effect?

Guan Yu took a deep breath, rubbing his hands together anxiously as he paced in circles, utterly conflicted. What should he do? Rush her to the hospital? Or... wait it out?

Waiting wasn't an option. If the venom proved too potent, the consequences could be dire! Yet she refused medical treatment.

Folk remedies crossed his mind—using spiders to suck out venom from snakebites. But aside from questionable efficacy, where could they find spiders in this sterile environment? Not even a fly buzzed in the room.

"This..." Guan Yu hesitated, looking at Liu Shilei uncertainly.

"Sister Shilei, let me... try squeezing out the venom." Even extracting a small amount might slow the poison's spread. Combined with his healing abilities, perhaps they could avert disaster. He steeled himself internally.

"No... don't..." Being a man, having him touch her inner thigh while she sat with legs parted—mere inches from her private area—was unbearably embarrassing.

Guan Yu understood her reservations. Frowning solemnly, he whispered, "Sister-in-law, this is serious. You refuse the hospital, but we don't know if this venom's fatal. Please trust me—I swear no improper thoughts. If you doubt me, I'll blindfold myself..."

As he reached for a scarf on the desk, Liu Shilei bit her lip. "Nevermind... proceed." She adjusted her tight office skirt, pulling the hem upward until it bunched at her hips.

Through flesh-toned stockings, the outline of white lace panties became clearly visible. Guan Yu swallowed hard, kneeling to firmly press around the wound.

While wiping away oozing venom with tissue, he froze—someone was entering! If discovered in this compromising position, especially compromising Liu Shilei's reputation... Thinking fast, he dragged her legs and ducked under the desk, pulling her chair flush against the furniture.

To any observer, Liu Shilei appeared normally seated. But crammed beneath the desk, Guan Yu's shoulders bore her legs like a yoke, her chest pressed against the desk edge. Only someone crawling underneath would detect anything amiss.

"Teacher Liu, not teaching today?" A male voice inquired—likely a colleague.

Liu Shilei's heart raced as she forced calm. "Not feeling well. Resting. Did you need something, Teacher Zhang?"

"Just checking on you. Feeling better after medication?" The man pulled up a chair, settling opposite her.

As their conversation continued, Guan Yu found his face mere centimeters from her intimate area. Warm breath fogged the sheer fabric, carrying an intoxicating feminine musk that made him gulp repeatedly.

The visible outline beneath dampening lace... Each inhalation flooded his senses. Women's secrets held such bewitching allure... Heat surged through him, arousal becoming painfully evident.

Chapter 110: Younger Brother, Help Me

While Liu Shilei maintained surface composure, Guan Yu's heated breaths beneath sent tidal waves of stimulation through her. An unfamiliar craving welled up—she longed to spread wider, press against his face...

Noticing her deepening flush, Teacher Zhang Zhang Rui hid a smirk. His cheap aphrodisiacs—intended for naive students—had serendipitously ensnared the campus goddess. "Let me escort you to rest," he pressed.

"No! I... I'm fine!" Liu Shilei snapped, though inner fires raged. When Zhang Rui reached to assist, she erupted: "Get out! Now!"

Baffled by her sudden resistance yet confident in the drugs' power, Zhang Rui stormed out, vowing to wait until desperation overcame her modesty.

"He's still outside," Guan Yu warned as Liu Shilei tried shifting. Though the venom had been mostly sucked out, each press of his lips against the wound reignited tremors through her body.

Uncontrollably, her hips began undulating against his face. "Younger brother... I need... keep sucking..." she begged, fingers tangling in his hair.

When Guan Yu pulled back in shock, she frantically guided his hand under her skirt. Slick heat greeted his touch as she gasped: "Help me... I can't endure..."

Chapter 111: Kiss (First Update)

Guan Yu's eyes widened at her wanton behavior. His middle finger sank into liquid warmth, her hips grinding against his palm. Using his special vision, he suddenly understood—she'd been drugged!

Rage flashed through him. That bastard Zhang Rui! Yet as her desperate moans filled the air, Guan Yu faced an impossible choice—honor or desire, familial duty or burning temptation...
