“Next to Wolf” mindlessly chased and slaughtered everyone in sight, killing anyone he encountered. It could truly be called a bloodbath. As a born killer, “Next to Wolf” showed no mercy, growing increasingly exhilarated with each life he took.

A Cai was summoned by Golden Flower for a specific task – to release all the prisoners from the iron cages in the western area. Only by completely disrupting this place would the real fun begin.

The iron cages were all locked, with keys held by different overseers. Whoever managed a prisoner kept that cage’s key. A Cai ran back and indeed found many keys on the corpses left by “Next to Wolf”, but these were only a fraction. The three-story cage structure contained nearly a hundred cells, each holding prisoners. Collecting all keys seemed impractical.

The caged prisoners, already tortured beyond endurance, huddled silently in their cells despite the chaos outside, terrified of becoming involved.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu pursued Kalasi outside the tea factory. Though Kalasi had hoped to escape under night’s cover, Guan Yu – as if possessing night vision – intercepted her at the main gate. Kalasi’s cultivation proved formidable.

In their stalemate, Guan Yu’s attacks were effortlessly dodged while Kalasi’s strikes dissipated against his protective shields. Guan Yu analyzed her techniques – his earlier blows had felt like punching cotton, leaving her unscathed. This futile exchange couldn’t continue.

“Young man,” Kalasi remarked coolly, “your talent is remarkable for one so young. Join us, and I guarantee boundless prospects. Why oppose me?”

“Madam Kalasi,” Guan Yu declared righteously, “your evil deeds demand heavenly punishment. Today, I execute justice.”

“Ridiculous!” she scoffed. “Half the world’s trades are illicit. Play god if you wish, but do you imagine yourself divine?”

“When evil crosses my path, I eradicate it. Though wickedness can’t be fully purged, each eliminated villain improves society.”

Kalasi suddenly realized Guan Yu wasn’t a rival assassin but merely a passerby opposing her crimes. Changing tactics, she offered: “I admire your character and skill. Consider joining our ranks.”

Playing along, Guan Yu asked: “What benefits would that bring?” Buying time until “Next to Wolf” arrived seemed prudent.

“Wealth beyond measure,” she promised. “Equal status with me. Name your price – any sum.”

“Gold holds little appeal,” Guan Yu replied. Kalasi sneered – who refused riches?

“Five hundred million dollars for my life tonight,” she bargained, though the sum pained her. Money could be regained – a life couldn’t.

“I care more about your organization’s structure,” Guan Yu probed. Kalasi revealed: “This is but a minor outpost. Our network spans nations, beyond your imagination.”

Guan Yu shuddered – a global syndicate controlling human trafficking could topple governments. Feigning interest, he taunted: “A genius like me deserves higher than equal footing with you.”

As they parried verbally, chaos erupted inside. Golden Flower and A Cai had unlocked cages using found keys, though many prisoners remained fearfully inside. Years of torture and brainwashing left them distrustful of rescuers.

A Cai resorted to smashing locks with a sledgehammer, understanding their trauma. Meanwhile, thirty-odd gang members surrounded “Next to Wolf” and Golden Flower in the basement.

A bearded brute brandishing a massive hammer roared: “Who dares challenge hell itself? None leave here alive!”

“Your leader’s dead,” “Next to Wolf” retorted casually, examining his bloodied blade. “Why die for a corpse?”

The brute laughed heartily: “Good riddance! Now I’ll rule!” His cohorts cheered – Kalasi’s demise meant power struggles.

Regretting his bluff, “Next to Wolf” amended: “Actually, Kalasi lives. I’ll relay your treason.”

The brute paled – Kalasi punished traitors by deep-frying them in oil.

“You’re bluffing!” the beard spat, hefting his hammer. The weapon’s massive iron head whistled through air as he charged.

Suddenly, Gambiri’s forces stormed in, surrounding the encircled gang. Her hulking companion Dayuan bulldozed through the crowd, his 300kg muscled frame clearing a path.

Golden Flower perched on Dayuan’s shoulder surveying the standoff – Gambiri’s reinforcements balanced the numbers. “Fighting’s pointless,” she addressed the beard. “Negotiate instead.”

The once-boastful brute now trembled before “Next to Wolf”’s glowing blade radiating crimson aura – the mark of a First-Class Sovereign’s qi manifestation. The crowd recoiled, recognizing imminent annihilation.

“Leave now and live,” “Next to Wolf” growled. “Persist, and my blade grants swift passage.”

Golden Flower taunted the cowering beard: “Where’s your bravado now? Come test your hammer!”

The trapped brute cursed his earlier arrogance. Survival required quick thinking...

...as the beard desperately backpedaled: “Honored warriors, perhaps this is misunderstanding! Has our humble operation offended you? Let’s discuss reasonably—”

But the hunters had become the hunted. Around them, freed prisoners began stirring, realization dawning that their tormentors’ reign might finally crumble.
