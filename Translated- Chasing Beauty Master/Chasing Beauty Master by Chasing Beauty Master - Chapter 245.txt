It was already late at night, yet Zhou Jin felt not the slightest hint of drowsiness.

Since sending Yang Long to collaborate with Ma De in eliminating Guan Yu, he had been pacing back and forth in the hall of a secret villa. Despite deploying so many well-equipped men, Zhou Jin's mind remained unsettled, simmering with an undercurrent of agitation.

The longer Yang Long stayed out, the more restless Zhou Jin grew. When news finally arrived, it was of Yang Long's death.

Zhou Jin looked as if struck by lightning, his expression blank and eyes vacant as he collapsed onto the sofa. He muttered repeatedly, "Yang Long is dead... Yang Long is dead..."

No matter how he reasoned, he couldn't accept this outcome.

The subordinate delivering the news stood at a distance, head bowed, not daring to breathe too loudly.

After a long silence, a flicker of vitality returned to Zhou Jin's eyes. He suddenly stood, his burning gaze pinning the subordinate as he growled in a low, barely restrained voice, "How did Yang Long die? Were the other fifty men eating shit?"

The authority of a leader required no weapons—a single sentence could make one tremble. The subordinate dared not meet Zhou Jin's eyes, stammering with unconcealed terror.

"B-boss... none of the men sent out... survived."

The subordinate's face turned ghostly pale. Though hardened by bloody battles, he had vomited upon seeing the field strewn with corpses during his reconnaissance mission.

"What? Total annihilation?" Zhou Jin's voice rose sharply in disbelief.

"Y-yes. None of our men survived. And... over half the attack dogs died too," the subordinate repeated his eyewitness account.

Zhou Jin's face shifted through expressions before he asked in a tone that betrayed his own skepticism, "Were there any unfamiliar bodies at the scene?"

After a moment's recollection, the subordinate shook his head. "No. We only found fifty-one corpses—all ours."

Zhou Jin's face drained of color, his eyes flickering with faint dread as he slumped back onto the sofa. "Dismissed," he rasped. "Give our brothers proper burials."

The subordinate bowed and retreated.

Alone on the sofa, Zhou Jin grappled with turbulent emotions. Eventually regaining composure, he took a deep breath and dialed a number. After a prolonged wait, the call connected.

"Come to the villa," Zhou Jin commanded before hanging up, leaving no room for refusal.

Dawn's first light tinged the sky when the summoned figure arrived—a woman with an oval face, phoenix eyes, and an enchanting figure clad in sleek office attire. Fatigue and irritation marred her bewitching features.

This was none other than Chu Hong.

Her already chaotic thoughts about Guan Yu's recent provocations had kept her awake all night. Before she could voice her anger upon entering, Zhou Jin's somber announcement froze her: "Yang Long is dead."

Her reprimand died unspoken, replaced by shock.

Zhou Jin exhaled cigarette smoke without looking up, bloodshot eyes glaring. "Guan Yu killed him."

"You moved against him?" Chu Hong's brow arched as she pieced together last night's events from his sparse words.

Zhou Jin nodded grimly.

"Why wasn't I informed?" she demanded.

Taking another drag, Zhou Jin replied coolly, "You were emotionally compromised yesterday. Moreover, Yang Long was best suited for this."

"If you distrust me, why summon me now?" Her voice turned icy.

"I need your help to kill Guan Yu." His murderous aura chilled her to the bone.

Every moment Guan Yu lived deepened Zhou Jin's unease. Reluctantly, he admitted Guan Yu's strength surpassed all expectations. Yang Long—a man of formidable prowess—had fallen alongside fifty men. That Guan Yu alone could achieve this... the thought terrified Zhou Jin into urgent action.

After Zhou Jin's declaration, heavy silence filled the villa.

"Why should I cooperate?" Chu Hong finally asked.

Zhou Jin relit his cigarette. "You have no choice but to refuse."

"Don't flaunt your cleverness, Zhou Jin. I'm not Yang Long—watch your tone!" she snapped.

"Last night, your behavior around Guan Yu made you unreliable. Our decade-long plans tolerate no risks." His gaze sharpened. "Besides... what retreat remains for you?"

Chu Hong's lips tightened. He was right—they stood together on a precipice. Refusal meant death today... but compliance might only delay it.

"How?" she asked flatly.

"Go to L City." A cold smile twisted his lips.

"L City? What's that to do with killing Guan Yu?"

"N City is his stronghold. We need to draw him out."

"You think I can lure him there?" she scoffed.

"You can't... but someone can. Xiao Xiong."

"Xiao Xiong? Cheng Gui's rival?"

Zhou Jin nodded. "Guan Yu rescued him from prison. Rumor says Xiao Xiong plans to hand L City's underworld to Guan Yu. It's time for Cheng Gui to act—you'll assist him."

"Can you make Cheng Gui move early?"

"I'll inform Boss Wan. Delay risks everything."

A week after Yang Long's failed ambush, Guan Yu enjoyed rare peace. With Du Xiaojuan visiting family and other companions gone, only Feng Xin remained at the villa—her disastrous cooking having miraculously improved through determined practice.

One morning, as Guan Yu descended in pajamas, Feng Xin served breakfast with a solemn announcement: "Xiao Xiong is in trouble."

**Chapter 615: Decision**

Xiao Xiong—legendary founder of the Moka Group who restructured L City's underworld in six months—faced catastrophe.

"What happened?" Guan Yu demanded, rushing to the table.

Though their bond wasn't deep, Guan Yu respected the principled man who'd offered him control of L City's forces. He'd kept discreet tabs through Feng Xin.

"L City's underworld erupted overnight," Feng Xin explained. "Cheng Gui of Hanhai Group dismantled Xiao Xiong's empire with brutal efficiency."

"Impossible!" Guan Yu blurted.

"I reacted similarly," Feng Xin nodded. "But evidence confirms it. Cheng Gui's sudden dominance defies logic—it reeks of conspiracy."

Guan Yu's mind raced. Xiao Xiong's rise from eighteen-year-old rookie to underworld king within years made this collapse inexplicable. "What's Cheng Gui's background?"

"A treacherous snake who murdered his own boss's family to seize power. He tolerated Xiao Xiong's rise until recently..." Disgust colored her voice.

"Could Zhou Jin be involved?" Guan Yu mused.

Feng Xin started. "Why?"

"Instinct. Zhou Jin's scheming might exploit this to lure me to L City—away from my N City resources. He knows I'll help Xiao Xiong."

"You think they're connected?"

"If they use Xiao Xiong as bait... yes." Guan Yu's eyes hardened. "Either way, I'm going."

Feng Xin studied his resolute face—no longer the boy she'd first met, but a man steeling for battle.
