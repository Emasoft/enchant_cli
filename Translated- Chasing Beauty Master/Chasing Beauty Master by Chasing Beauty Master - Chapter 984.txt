Guan Yu feigned a contemplative expression, stroking his chin as he drawled, “Hmm, let me think carefully…”

He paused theatrically before continuing, “A few days ago, Gao Bing and I had quite an extended conversation. We found common ground, and he divulged numerous secrets about your Fang family—over twenty recordings, in fact. If you wish to reclaim all of them, settling on a fair price will be… complicated.”

His implication was clear: a low offer would be rejected outright, while an exorbitant sum might warrant consideration. Trapped by the leverage he held, Fang Ding had no choice but to swallow her pride and negotiate.

To her credit, Fang Ding betrayed no irritation. “Then name your price, Boss Guan. If it’s within the Fang family’s means, I’ll consider it.”

“Each of these twenty-plus recordings contains unique revelations,” Guan Yu countered, his tone sly. “To me, they’re mere curiosities. Their true worth lies in how much the Fang family values its reputation. Why don’t *you* propose a figure?”

By tossing the ball back into her court, Guan Yu aimed to gauge her financial limits. An outrageous demand might scare her off, rendering his blackmail efforts futile.

Fang Ding hesitated. She’d arrived prepared to exchange three million for what she assumed were two or three recordings. Twenty changed everything. Gao Bing’s betrayal now threatened to drown the Fang family in scandal.

“Five million,” she offered after a tense silence. “For all the recordings.”

“Five million?” Guan Yu chuckled, fingers still tracing his jawline. “That exchanges five million for twenty scandals capable of ruining your family. Seems… modest.”

He emphasized “twenty” repeatedly, numbing Fang Ding with the weight of implication. Could her family truly harbor so many damning secrets?

Growing skeptical, she demanded proof. “You keep boasting about these recordings, yet I’ve seen none. Since we’re on your turf and I can’t escape, why not show them? Let’s discuss pricing afterward.”

“As you wish, Miss Fang.” Guan Yu waved dismissively to Jia Bo, who retrieved a small pouch from another room.

The bag spilled forth over two dozen voice recorders. “To demonstrate good faith,” Guan Yu said, “sample any recording here. Verify their authenticity yourself.”

**Chapter 2,516: This Is My Territory**

Fang Ding selected a device at random. Gao Bing’s voice emerged, detailing the Fang family’s recent smuggling operations. A second recorder exposed another illicit scheme.

“Convinced?” Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. “Given the volume, your offer remains insufficient.”

Flushed with shame yet defiant, Fang Ding snapped, “I’ve only heard two! How do I know the rest aren’t duplicates?”

“Do I strike you as a man who collects redundant evidence?” Guan Yu’s smile vanished. “If you insist on insults, our discussion ends here.”

“You can’t keep these!” she retorted. “Name your real price.”

“One million. No backups. Pay now, take everything.”

The sum dwarfed her prepared funds. “I only have five million!” she protested. “Can’t you halve it? Consider it a personal favor owed.”

“Your favor isn’t worth half a million,” Guan Yu scoffed. “My men risked their lives for these. Several lie hospitalized thanks to your family’s thugs. One million. Not a cent less.”

When Fang Ding pleaded logistical delays, he offered a chilling compromise: “Take half now. Return with another five million for the rest.”

“You mock me!” she seethed. “Do you think I can’t seize them by force?”

Jia Bo stepped forward, snarling, “Watch your tongue! Being a woman won’t save you from a beating!”

As Yu Gang members closed in, Guan Yu raised a placating hand. “Remember, Miss Fang—you’re in *my* domain. Cross me, and you won’t leave tonight.”

**Chapter 2,517: Calling Reinforcements**

Undeterred, Fang Ding spat, “You think numbers intimidate me?” She dialed a contact. “Kangzi! I’m at the west city construction site. Bring men—now!”

After a string of calls, she sneered at Guan Yu, “You’re not the only one with allies. Let’s see how long your arrogance lasts.”

Guan Yu leaned back, idly toying with the recorders. “By all means, summon your champions. I’ll await their… disappointment.”

Fang Ding’s subsequent calls mobilized more allies—a infatuated martial arts senior and a brutish admirer dubbed “Brother Wolf.” Flushed with triumph, she envisioned Guan Yu’s imminent humiliation.

Unfazed, Guan Yu remarked, “I do hope your friends prove entertaining. It’s been a dull evening.”

**Chapter 2,518: No Disappointments Guaranteed**

“Just you wait!” Fang Ding hissed, her beauty sharpened by spite. “When they arrive, you’ll beg on your knees!”

Guan Yu’s smirk never wavered. As a cultivator boasting rare talent—her youth belying a Lower Second-Class尊下位 cultivation—Fang Ding had always enthralled martial circles. Tonight, however, her charms would test against cold pragmatism.

The stage was set: a spoiled heiress accustomed to worship, now confronting a man whose ambition eclipsed her pedigree. Outside, engines roared as her reinforcements converged.

“Promise me no disappointments,” Guan Yu murmured to the night air, readying for chaos.
