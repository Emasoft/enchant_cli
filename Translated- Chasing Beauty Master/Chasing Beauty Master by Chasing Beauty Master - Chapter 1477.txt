Guan Yu said, “I’m going out to buy two sets of clothes. Wait here for me.” Wang Jun replied, “I’ll go with you. Once we’ve chosen, we can head straight there.”

After a moment’s thought, Liu Yun interjected, “If you two want clothes, there’s a shop called Quanjia Tailor in town. Their garments are excellent and affordable.”

Once outside, Guan Yu and Wang Jun wandered the streets but found no sign of Quanjia Tailor. “Liu Yun didn’t even give a proper address,” Guan Yu muttered. “Might as well pick any shop.”

They headed south, as Guan Yu recalled seeing a large, impressive clothing store there yesterday. The shop, named Fortune Tailor Shop, had a garish sign but a grand facade. “The goods inside must be decent,” Guan Yu remarked.

Upon entering, a hunched elderly man scurried over. The shop was empty except for the two. “Honored guests, what may I assist you with?” the man asked, craning his neck to look up at Guan Yu.

“We need two fine, luxurious outfits. Show us something suitable,” Guan Yu said.

“We have all styles here, guaranteed to please,” the man replied. “Though prices may be steep, our quality is unmatched.” His eyes lingered on their plain, commoner-like attire—borrowed from Liu Yun—hinting at doubt about their means.

“Cost isn’t an issue. Bring out the clothes,” Guan Yu insisted.

The man led them upstairs, where the garments were undeniably upscale: finer fabrics, elegant cuts, and ornate designs. Guan Yu immediately spotted a white young noble’s attire with purple accents and intricate embroidery. “This one,” he declared.

“Marvelous choice!” the tailor fawned. “This is our finest piece. Feel the fabric—pure quality!”

Guan Yu ignored the pitch. “I’ll take this. Wang Jun, pick yours.”

Wang Jun hesitated. “Aren’t you even asking the price?”

The tailor interjected, “I can offer a discount, but this piece is costly due to its materials—”

“Enough,” Guan Yu cut in. “Charge what you must. Business seems slow lately, no?”

The man forced a laugh. “Our shop sees daily customers! Recent… events in town have merely reduced foot traffic.”

“Then consider us your patrons today. Price it fairly, or we leave.”

Wang Jun selected a simpler azure outfit, befitting an attendant. After paying, they changed. Guan Yu surveyed Wang Jun approvingly. “Perfect. Remember your role as my attendant—it’ll smooth our dealings.”

“You get the glory; I get the scraps. Typical,” Wang Jun grumbled.

Guan Yu added a folding fan to complete his noble guise. As they walked, townsfolk stared—wealthy families had fled recent troubles, making their presence conspicuous.

“Should we head to the magistrate’s office now?” Wang Jun asked.

“Not yet.” Guan Yu paused. “A noble needs a carriage. No proper young master travels on foot.”

Wang Jun scoffed. “Where do you think we are? This isn’t A City with your precious Da Hang cars!”

“True,” Guan Yu sighed, eyeing the rugged road. “Even a Hummer would struggle here. But we need a carriage—preferably rented.”

They returned to Liu Yun, who gaped at Guan Yu’s transformation. “So handsome!” she blurted, cheeks flushing. At twenty-five with two children, she still harbored a girlish heart.

Guan Yu ignored her admiration. “Do you know any wealthy households with fine carriages?”

“The Li family in the east has many,” Liu Yun said. “But why? Are you leaving? What about helping our town?”

“The carriage is part of our plan,” Guan Yu reassured. “Prepare dinner—we’ll return victorious.”

At the Li Estate’s imposing vermilion gates, guarded by stone lions, Guan Yu knocked. A surly guard cracked the door. “State your business.”

“We’re travelers seeking to purchase a carriage,” Guan Yu said, irritation flickering at the discourtesy.

After scrutiny, they were ushered into an opulent parlor with gilded chairs and silk carpets. A maid served tea. “The master will join you shortly.”

Wang Jen shot Guan Yu a look: *This Li fellow loves his pomp.*

Guan Yu suddenly announced, “My attendant needs the privy. Have your maid guide him.”
