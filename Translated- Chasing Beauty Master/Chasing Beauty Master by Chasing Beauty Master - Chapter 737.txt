“Yes, yes, Sister Lanyu, should we call for backup? Can Brother-in-law handle this alone?”

“Rest assured, Guanyu will be fine,” Lan Yu declared resolutely, though anxiety gnawed at her heart. Never had she seen Guanyu engage in such a serious fight. Clearly, this opponent was extraordinary. All she could do now was silently cheer for him.

Even if they summoned family bodyguards, it would prove futile. In clashes between martial masters, ordinary people became liabilities rather than assets, their presence only serving as distractions.

Guanyu externalized his inner energy, as did Li Zhiming. The air around Guanyu shimmered gold, his protective shield visibly expanding to onlookers’ eyes.

This golden aura manifested from their clashing energies – a single exchange between experts sufficed to gauge strength. Now their battle had escalated to pure inner power confrontation.

Suddenly, Li Zhiming flicked his right wrist, conjuring a black energy arrow that streaked towards Guanyu. The golden shield rippled like disturbed water yet held firm. Li Zhiming nearly vomited blood, barely suppressing the surge through sheer willpower. Shock coursed through him – that strike had contained eighty percent of his power, yet failed to breach the shield. He’d gravely underestimated his opponent.

The rebounding damage mechanism of Guanyu’s shield now activated fully. Li Zhiming’s earlier attack had struck before the shield’s completion, sparing him retaliation. But this time, the perfected defense reflected the assault’s full force back at its sender.

Spectators witnessed the hall divided – one half bathed in gold, the other shrouded in ashen gloom.

As their energy clash continued, physical strikes interspersed the contest. Li Zhiming’s initial composure evaporated. Suddenly, both combatants vanished from view.

Reappearing mid-hall, their blurred forms clashed in a flurry of strikes. Within exchanges, Li Zhiming found himself outmatched. Guanyu’s impenetrable shield rendered attacks futile while reflecting damage proportionally – the harder the strike, the greater the rebound.

Forced to simultaneously assault the shield and evade his own rebounding energy, Li Zhiming fought at dire disadvantage. Guanyu seized an opening, his kick sending the opponent crashing against third-floor railings with bloodied cough.

Guanyu landed gracefully, golden aura retracting as he gazed down at his fallen foe.

“Wow! Brother-in-law’s amazing! I adore him!”

“Brother-in-law’s unstoppable! Brother-in-law’s invincible!”

Lan Yu rolled her eyes at her sisters’ chants. The sudden cheers nearly disrupted Guanyu’s energy flow mid-battle. These chants – first “stand tall”, now “get hard”? Ridiculous!

But mercy had no place here. Guanyu leapt to the defeated man’s side, palm edged toward Li Zhiming’s neck for the final strike.

“Spare me! I acknowledge my wrongs!” The once-arrogant fighter now groveled desperately.

“What merit spares your life?” Guanyu stayed his hand coldly.

“I’m close with your friend, the Second-in-command! He wouldn’t want this! For his sake, grant mercy!”

......

“Now you plead? Where’s your former bravado?” Guanyu mocked the broken man.

“I’ll spare you. But continue enabling underlings, and no one’s influence will stay my hand.”

This clemency stemmed not from connections, but recognition of Li Zhiming’s redeemable qualities and rare skill. Perhaps this lesson could forge friendship from enmity.

“Thank you! I’ll discipline my men strictly!”

“May we yet become allies.” Guanyu extended a hand, hauling the man up.

“I’d value such a formidable friend,” Li Zhiming conceded.

Outside observers marveled – fierce opponents now clasping hands. “Brother-in-law’s so magnanimous! I want to be his woman too!”

Lan Yu pinched her sister’s waist playfully. “You hussies! Trying to steal my man? Still want to be friends?...”

......

Next morning’s gloomy skies promised rain. As Guanyu prepared for school, Amei rushed out with an umbrella. “Take this! Catching cold’s no good!”

Touched by her care, Guanyu thanked her before speeding off.

Campus corridors brought encounter with Chen Tianxiao. “Hey! Everyone’s training hard for the tournament. What’ve you been up to?”

“My methods differ, that’s all.”

“Right, you’re the prodigy! Off to basketball court drills. See you!”

Classroom gossipmonger Wei Hongwei pounced immediately. “Boss! Rumor says you beat Mic’s leader last night! True?”

Guanyu flicked the boy’s forehead. “News travels fast when it’s none of your business!”

As Wei launched into flattery, Lü Mei interjected worriedly: “Always fighting! You’ll get hurt someday!”

Before Guanyu could respond, Wei changed tack: “Goddess! When’s my blind date? I’m dying here!”

“Impatient fool! I’ve selected candidates. Wait for arrangements.” Lü Mei’s retort hid private concerns about two female students’ unusually intimate gazes at Guanyu.

......

During lunch stroll, they encountered Wang Bo – leader of the Brotherhood faction – training disciples in a grove. The exchange remained courteous but brief, Guanyu disinterested in recruitment.

Returning to class brought news: “Chen Maosheng’s discharged! Back tomorrow!”

“That quick? Must’ve been too gentle last time.”

The classroom door then admitted an angelic vision – Zhang Han, the loli-styled school beauty, bouncing over to perch on Guanyu’s lap. “Uncle-in-law! Missed me?”

Lü Mei’s jealousy flared anew as Guanyu groaned internally. This living doll’s arrival meant new headaches – her saccharine clinginess rivaled Lan Yu’s.

“Shouldn’t you respect your elder?” Guanyu tried weakly.

“Spank me then!” She presented her bottom cheekily before producing a giant lollipop. “Share?”

As Zhang Han began licking the candy, Guanyu realized her ever-present bag held nothing but snacks. “Still carrying treats everywhere? When will you grow up?”

The cycle continued – admiration from peers, exasperation for Guanyu, and Lü Mei’s simmering醋意. Campus life remained anything but dull.
