Wen Qing gazed at Zhongnanhai with a complex expression and sighed.

When Guan Yu brought Zhao Jing'er (Tranquil) out, the young girl's eyes were still rimmed red from parting with her grandfather. Yet her spirits lifted upon seeing Wen Qing in the car, and she chatted and laughed with her throughout the journey.

Guan Yu wore a grave expression. While fetching Zhao Jing'er, he had spoken privately with Zhao Zilong (Dragon Child) about Lin Dong. Zhao Zilong had offered to assign bodyguards for Guan Yu's protection, but Guan Yu refused.

Zhao Zilong had already helped him immensely. Sending guards to N City might invite criticism, and Guan Yu didn’t want to burden him further.

He sensed Lin Dong’s focus had shifted from assassination to a deliberate game—a contest of wits. Though this was mere speculation, Guan Yu intended to emerge victorious.

Lying awake the previous night, Guan Yu had compared his strength to Lin Dong’s and found himself lacking. Yet he held one trump card: the ancient coin.

After analyzing his four abilities, he concluded the Pet System could counter Lin Dong. By controlling venomous insects, he could launch undetectable attacks—a tactic even Lin Dong might struggle against. This conviction partly justified rejecting Zhao Zilong’s offer.

The pressing issue was acquiring a toxic insect. He thought of Feng Xin (Joyful), whose connections in N City could easily procure one. After dropping Wen Qing and Zhao Jing'er at the villa, Guan Yu headed straight to Feng Xin.

At her office, Guan Yu knocked and entered. Feng Xin, engrossed in case files, didn’t notice him.

“Working so intently?” Guan Yu chuckled.

Feng Xin’s initial irritation melted into a faint smile, though her tone remained calm. “You’re back.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Came to see you right away.” He browsed the files on her desk.

“Need something?” she asked.

“Can’t I visit without an agenda?”

Feng Xin smirked skeptically.

Scratching his head, Guan Yu admitted, “I need Xin-jie’s help finding a small, highly venomous insect in N City.”

“Why?” she frowned.

“Urgent use.” He evaded.

Without pressing further, Feng Xin resumed work. “I’ll inquire. Expect answers in a couple days.”

Grinning, Guan Yu noticed a file and picked it up. “Unrest in N City’s underworld?”

Feng Xin set down her pen. “Minor factions are expanding. Harmless for now—even beneficial, as their reshuffling indirectly aids us.”

Guan Yu frowned, sensing unease he couldn’t articulate. Tossing the file aside, he dismissed it.

**Chapter 472: The Despondent Luo Cheng**

“Anything else?” Feng Xin asked irritably as Guan Yu lingered.

“Nothing… Will you return to the villa tonight?”

Blushing, Feng Xin whispered, “Yes.”

Guan Yu, having asked casually, didn’t grasp her fluster. “I’ll head out then. Haven’t visited school yet.”

As he left, Feng Xin added, “Check on Luo Cheng. He’s been struggling with… emotional issues.”

Guan Yu warmed at her care for his friends. Yet confusion arose—when had Luo Cheng gotten a girlfriend?

“Thanks, Xin-jie.”

She waved him off.

Before visiting Luo Cheng, Guan Yu decided to see Liu Shilei (Poetic Bud), lest she feel neglected. Driving to campus at dusk, he found her preparing dinner. Thrilled by his return, they shared an intimate moment before eating.

Afterward, Liu Shilei didn’t probe his Beijing trip, simply bidding him farewell cheerfully.

**Chapter 474: I Have Someone I Like**

By 10 PM, Guan Yu reached the bustling bar. A starstruck server directed him to Luo Cheng and Niu Le (Happy Ox), drinking in a corner.

“Brother Luo, plenty of fish in the sea! Why fixate on one flower?” Niu Le slurred, arm slung over Luo Cheng. “With your looks, any beauty’s within reach!”

Luo Cheng drained his glass wordlessly.

Niu Le persisted. “You’re a mess! If Brother Yu sees you—what’s so great about Shao Dan (Cinnabar) anyway?”

“You don’t understand love,” Luo Cheng muttered.

“Love my ass! It’s just lust!” Niu Le slammed the table.

“Love consumes your thoughts. She becomes your pillar… Ah, why explain to a brick wall?”

“Then why not chase her?” Guan Yu interjected, joining them.

“Brother Yu!” Luo Cheng started.

Niu Le whined, “You didn’t take me to Beijing!”

“You’d have more fun here,” Guan Yu chuckled, noting Luo Cheng’s haggard state. “Did you confess?”

Luo Cheng nodded.

“She rejected you?”

A bitter half-nod followed.

“She’s law enforcement. I’m a gangster. No future there,” Luo Cheng rasped.

“Bullshit! Her dad’s a snob pushing some rich punk!” Niu Le blurted.

Guan Yu’s voice turned icy. “Are you a man or not?”

“I’m a man making the hardest choice!” Luo Cheng shattered his glass.

“You’re courting her, not her father!” Guan Yu snapped.

Luo Cheng froze.

**The Next Morning**

At 8 AM, Luo Cheng’s call woke Guan Yu. “Help me pick gifts? I might ruin it.”

“It’s your father-in-law, not mine.” Guan Yu hung up, cuddling Du Xiaojuan (Morning Cuckoo), who’d cried herself to sleep in his arms.

Later, at the bar, Niu Le teased, “Brother Luo’s been waiting! Shao Dan left him hanging for her dad’s birthday.”

“Gifts?” Guan Yu asked.

“A golden Buddha… and a ring.” Luo Cheng flushed.

Niu Le howled, “Blushing! Never thought I’d see the day!”

Laughing, they drove to the venue in Guan Yu’s Mercedes.

At the hotel, Shao Dan’s father, Shao Guobang, fawned over Liu Xing, a suitor bearing a 100,000-yuan Rolex.

“Dad, this is too much!” Shao Dan protested.

“Nonsense! Liu Xing’s connections got the bank director here! My promotion’s assured!”

Shao Dan seethed as her father preened.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s group arrived, ready to disrupt the charade.
