“Did you see that? That’s Dragon Lord’s chariot! Dragon Lord has finally made his move! That kid’s days are numbered!” Xiao Nao exclaimed, his eyes blazing with excitement as he stared at the car.

Zamao, who naturally recognized Long Tian’s vehicle, nodded solemnly. A wild idea suddenly flashed through his mind, and he said eagerly, “Brother Nao, should we follow them? I’ve only heard of Long Tian’s reputation but never witnessed Dragon Lord’s true might!”

“See your mother’s ass!”

Out of habit, Xiao Nao slapped him again.

Yet he hesitated. Truth be told, his heart itched with temptation—this was indeed a rare opportunity.

After a moment of contemplation, Xiao Nao said, “We’ll follow from a distance. Don’t interfere with Dragon Lord’s business. Understood?”

Zamao’s eyes lit up instantly, nodding like a chicken pecking rice. He slammed the accelerator to the floor, and the car shot into the darkness.

As for Long Tian, the legendary figure in Zamao and Xiao Nao’s minds, he now lounged lazily in the driver’s seat, his face stern. With one hand on the steering wheel and the other resting on the window, his eyes gleamed with mockery as he stared at the speeding Mercedes ahead.

His gaze resembled a cat toying with a mouse.

In this scenario, he was the cat, and the Mercedes ahead was the mouse.

He had never considered concealing his speed. Thus, Guan Yu quickly noticed his presence and immediately accelerated.

“Trying to show off your speed in front of me? That’ll only get you killed faster!” Long Tian sneered, watching the Mercedes ahead.

Suddenly, he stomped the accelerator, maneuvering the steering wheel with one hand. The car slithered like a snake, effortlessly overtaking vehicles one after another, closing in on Guan Yu’s Mercedes.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu also floored the accelerator. Yet, due to differences in vehicle performance and skill, the distance between them barely widened.

At that moment, a heavy truck loomed ahead, blocking Guan Yu’s path. To avoid being crushed by the truck’s rear, Guan Yu had no choice but to swerve around it.

“It’s over!” Long Tian declared Guan Yu’s doom.

**Chapter 932: Perilous Circumstances**

The heavy truck continued its steady pace, oblivious to the chaos behind.

Guan Yu yanked the steering wheel hard, the car darting to the truck’s right side, aiming to pass it.

Just as the Mercedes’ front cleared the truck’s rear, Long Tian’s modified Bentley abruptly pulled alongside Guan Yu’s car.

In a flash, Long Tian turned his head and grinned coldly at Guan Yu. The Bentley veered sideways, crashing into the Mercedes.

Confident, Long Tian intended to crush Guan Yu’s car beneath the truck’s rear.

But then, the unimaginable happened.

As Guan Yu seemed cornered, his car suddenly accelerated explosively, shooting forward like a rabbit.

Now, Long Tian’s Bentley hurtled toward the truck’s rear.

Panicking, Long Tian jerked the wheel and slammed the brakes. The car spun wildly before colliding with the guardrail.

*Boom!*

The Bentley’s rear crumpled. Though unharmed, Long Tian sat trembling, drenched in cold sweat.

He couldn’t comprehend how Guan Yu’s car had accelerated impossibly at the critical moment.

“You’re truly relentless!” Guan Yu chuckled, glancing at the rearview mirror.

Li Xi, pale-faced, muttered, “You really love thrills.”

“Want something even more thrilling?” Guan宇 smirked mischievously.

Li Xi fell silent.

Guan宇 glanced back, spotting the Bentley closing in. “Persistent bastard!” he muttered.

Yet, he admired Long Tian’s skill. Without his gravity system, the collision would’ve been fatal.

But now, he wanted Long Tian’s life.

“Since you’re silent, I’ll take that as a yes!”

Guan宇 floored the accelerator. The Mercedes, under 60% gravity reduction, became a shadow, vanishing into the night.

Long Tian gaped in disbelief.

Even he had never seen a Mercedes reach such speeds.

“This is madness!” he hissed, activating a hidden boost. The Bentley roared, chasing the Mercedes.

Guan宇 glanced back, smirking. “Time to end this!”

He braked hard, spinning the wheel. The car pivoted, now逆行ing against traffic.

Li Xi’s face drained of color.

Guan宇 laughed maniacally. “Let’s see something *really*刺激!”

Horns blared as cars swerved, drivers cursing.

Ignoring them, Guan宇 raced on.

Finally, headlights pierced the darkness—Long Tian’s Bentley.

Guan宇 braked,横挡在路中间.

“Now it’s time to catch the turtle!” he declared.

*Boom!*

The Bentley spun uncontrollably, crashing into the guardrail.

Guan宇 stepped out, phone in hand.

Li Xi watched his背影, emotions swirling.

关宇 hauled Long Tian from the wreck. “Your skills weren’t bad.”

“You’ll pay for this!” Long Tian snarled.

“Still arrogant?” 关宇 sneered. “Your豪门 is nothing!”

With a swift kick, Long Tian’s ribs cracked.

“Now,” 关宇 smiled coldly, “answer my questions.”

**Chapter 933: Trapped**

关宇 stood triumphant, the Bentley wrecked behind him.

**Chapter 934: Crushing Defeat**

The battle ended as swiftly as it began—Long Tian lay defeated,豪门’s pride shattered.
