Moreover, the treasure map that had been on the table was also missing, presumably rehidden inside the shoes by the other party. Bill Lin thought to himself, "I'm about to purchase this any moment now. Couldn't you have aired out the map's stench beforehand? Do you expect me to receive a freshly reeking treasure map after buying it?"

The indoor odor had somewhat dissipated, allowing Bill Lin and his two companions to finally sit down comfortably.

Xie Lao (Wicked Elder) asked impatiently, "If you're not serious about buying, I'll leave now. Why waste everyone's time?"

"Please stay calm, Elder. We absolutely wish to purchase your treasure map. It's just the price..." Poison Widow interjected.

Bill Lin, wanting to expedite matters in this unpleasant environment, cut in decisively: "Let's make this simple. Since the Yang Family Auction House already bid sixteen million, I'll add another million. How's that? I conduct business swiftly without unnecessary delays."

Xie Lao remained silent, appearing to deliberate. Luo Bo, seeing the reluctance, pressed, "This offer is more than generous. Our young master always gives the highest bids. What's there to hesitate about?"

"Only a million more counts as 'highest'?" Xie Lao retorted pointedly.

Luo Bo countered, "What more could you expect for this stinking map? Though valuable, you've made it reek unbearably. Where would anyone even store it? Do you imagine fetching higher bids elsewhere?"

Infuriated by these remarks, Xie Lao stood abruptly. "My possessions are mine to handle! Whether stinking or trampled to shreds, that's my business! If you're not buying, quit wasting time! I won't sell today at all! Farewell!"

As Xie Lao turned to leave, Luo Bo looked stunned. The acrid stench was undeniable – were they not even permitted to mention it?

Bill Lin quickly rose to intercept. "Elder, please stay! Let's discuss this properly—"

But Xie Lao departed without a backward glance. Bill Lin glared furiously at Luo Bo. "Have you lost your mind today? Spouting such useless words! Did any of that help our position? Now you've driven him away – what's your brilliant solution?"

Luo Bo hung his head, muttering contritely, "Never expected that old codger to storm off over a few remarks..."

As Bill Lin fumed, Poison Widow intervened diplomatically: "Young Master Bill, don't fret. Few would bid over seventeen million. Our offer stands strong. Let's reach out again and negotiate."

Approving her reasoning, Bill Lin nodded. "Have our people contact him immediately. We must secure that map before it reaches Yang's auction house."

**Chapter 2997: Infectious Disease**

Bill Lin knew auction house prices would double the current bid. Securing it now was crucial.

Sniffing his own clothes distastefully, Bill Lin declared, "Enough standing here. I need thorough washing." He led the group toward bathhouses.

Guan Yu monitored these developments. Xie Lao wouldn't sell below twenty million as instructed – Bill Lin's seventeen million offer fell short. Despite the map's odor, its value remained intact.

Post-meeting, Xie Lao relished recounting how he'd fumigated Bill Lin's group to tears. Guan Yu found the report amusing but avoided direct contact – even through phone calls, the imagined stench lingered. Investigating further, Guan Yu learned Xie Lao used the stink to mask bloodstains from his past, evoking unexpected sympathy.

Guan Yu granted Xie Lao urban freedom for minor affairs, provided no major crimes occurred. Now they awaited Bill Lin's next move while Xie Lao carefully avoided numerous treasure hunters.

Xie Lao's clever rumor about foot-borne infectious diseases deterred most opportunists – claiming shoe tamperers would rot alive. Though typically dubious, his malodorous state lent credibility. Survival instincts outweighed treasure lust.

Guan Yu chuckled at the tactic. Whether Bill Lin believed the contagion tale mattered little – desperation would override caution. The waiting game continued, though Xie Lao seemed to savor city life, delaying final transactions. Having achieved their goal of occupying Bill Lin's attention, Guan Yu didn't press – their agreement involved profit-sharing post-sale, not direct orders.

**Chapter 2998: Mischievous**

Anticipating quiet days ahead, Guan Yu received unexpected visitors – police captain Lin Qiaoqiao arrived at Qiao Garden District.

Lounging on the parlor sofa with Yoko massaging his shoulders, Guan Yu called out, "Jingjing, your bestie's here!"

Xue Jing emerged from the kitchen, checking the security monitor. "Why's she coming?" she muttered, uneasy about the bubbly officer's apparent interest in Guan Yu.

"Should I make myself scarce?" Guan Yu offered.

Yoko admired the screen image. "What an exquisite girl! I thought all beauties resided here – except the Yangs. But this one's adorably unique."

Xue Jing rolled eyes at Yoko's praise as Guan Yu retreated with Yoko to Zhang Han's gaming den where Lan Yu, Lü Mei, and Zhang Han remained glued to screens despite Guan Yu's enforced bedtime rules.

"Here to watch?" Lan Yu smiled over her shoulder. Guan Yu nodded, settling on the bed while Yoko resumed her amateur massage.

Meanwhile, Xue Jing greeted Lin Qiaoqiao at the door. "Looking for Guan Yu?" she asked pointedly after the officer's immediate inquiry.

"Visiting you, of course!" Lin Qiaoqiao fibbed, munching an apple from A-Mei's fruit platter. "Though Guan Yu could show some gratitude after my recent help."

Reluctantly summoned, Guan Yu startled Lin Qiaoqiao by shouting near her ear. "AHH! You idiot!" she scolded, clutching her chest. "Nearly gave me a heart attack!"

After settling, Lin Qiaoqiao demanded repayment for helping imprison Sun Xu. Guan Yu countered that she'd gained career merits, but she insisted: "Lend me yourself as a three-day fake boyfriend!"

Xue Jing immediately vetoed: "Impossible now. Not out of jealousy – there's danger involved." She cryptically alluded to Guan Yu's current vulnerability without mentioning his lost cultivation.

**Chapter 2999: Disbelief**

"Would I really endanger him?" Lin Qiaoqiao protested. "He's handled worse!"

Xue Jing remained firm. "Circumstances have changed. Trust me – it's crucial."

Unconvinced, Lin Qiaoqiao probed further until Xue Jing hinted at undisclosed perils. The officer finally relented but remained skeptical, unaware of Guan Yu's power loss. Meanwhile, Guan Yu watched the exchange bemused, caught between the women's conflicting concerns while the gamers remained oblivious, absorbed in their virtual worlds.
