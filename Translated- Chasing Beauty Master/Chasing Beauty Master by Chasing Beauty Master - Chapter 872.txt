On the way back, none of the girls paid attention to Guan Yu anymore, all engrossed in their new phones. Only the village chief's daughter kept trying to engage him, but Guan Yu remained aloof. When she asked about the phones, he gave vague answers, pretending not to hear her other questions.

By the time they returned to his aunt's house at dusk, the sky had darkened. Guan Yu sat down to dinner with Ling'er, Mei Mei, and several of her close friends. The girls took turns reproaching him—those who hadn't gone to buy medicine missed out on getting iPhones, their regret palpable.

Though Guan Yu would have gladly bought more, it was too late to return to the county town. After using the medicine he brought, his aunt's spirits had lifted considerably—a testament to how mental state affects recovery. Knowing she'd receive city treatment for her leg with Guan Yu's help, she felt like she'd met her guardian angel, his afternoon's generosity already transforming their fortunes.

The imported oral and topical medications Guan Yu purchased worked wonders for her neuralgia. While the oral medicine addressed root causes, the topical ointment functioned like mystical plaster, soothing nerve-related ailments.

Throughout the meal, the village chief's daughter clung to Guan Yu's side. Ling'er occupied his left, while the chief's daughter had claimed his right early on. When Shuangshuang tried to swap seats under the guise of asking phone advice, the chief's daughter countered: "I need to consult Guan Yu too—my questions are even more pressing!"

Fuming but constrained by hospitality, Shuangshuang stomped off to help in the kitchen. Trapped between chattering girls, Guan Yu maintained an endless conversation with the chief's daughter as defensive strategy. He noticed her fair complexion and fashionable clothes set her apart from village girls.

Unbeknownst to him, the girls had plotted to get him drunk. Mountain folk drank boldly, and they filled their cups with baijiu. When urged to join, Ling'er shook her head vehemently: "I really can’t, I don’t drink. Honestly, I can’t."

Amid protests of "Just a little for celebration!" Ling'er stuck to cola. The girls turned their full attention to Guan Yu. A bobbed-hair girl raised her cup: "Handsome, let's toast! I'll drink one, you take two!"

Ling'er objected: "Why should he drink double?" But the chief's daughter saw opportunity—drunkenness could forge irreversible bonds. "It's Mei Mei's happy day!" she coaxed. "Drinking's fine—we'll sleep it off later!"

"Bring it on," Guan Yu grinned, aware of their schemes. Even in cities, women flocked to his striking looks. But these rural girls didn't know his secret—internal energy could purge alcohol at will.

Round after round, the girls flushed crimson. Two coughed violently after their first baijiu experience. By third cups, cheeks glowed and tongues loosened. The chief's daughter, despite controlling intake, grew bold—sliding Guan Yu's hand over her body as heat and alcohol thickened the air.

"Let me take this off," she purred, removing her outer layer to reveal a tight camisole. Guan Yu's peripheral vision filled with bouncing curves. Though mildly buzzed from pounds of liquor, he embraced the warm haze.

When one girl staggered out to vomit, Guan Yu shook his head at their stubbornness. The conversation descended into raunchy confessions—first loves, hotel trysts. Ling'er fled, ears burning, while the chief's daughter boasted of carnal experiments: "Ever been taken front and back? Heavenly! I couldn't walk for days!"

A dimpled girl noticed Guan Yu's rapt attention. "You're hearing all our secrets!" she teased. The chief's daughter slumped against him, cleavage exposed. "How should I thank you for the iPhone?" she murmured, voice electrifying.

As laughter erupted at Guan Yu's blushing, the dimpled girl declared: "He's yours tonight! With those broad palms and strong nose, he'll rock your world!" The chief's daughter giggled agreement: "Why not? A rich hunk like him..."

Feigning arousal, Guan Yu excused himself. The chief's daughter assumed he sought private relief, but he headed outside for air. His aunt sent Shuangshuang after him. Finding him in the courtyard, the girl helped locate the outhouse.

"You barely ate," Shuangshuang noted post-relief. Guan Yu praised her helpfulness compared to the drunken crowd. "It's that chief's daughter!" Shuangshuang pouted. "Stole my seat beside you!"

"Come visit in the city," Guan Yu consoled. "I'll treat you properly." As they returned, neither anticipated the chief's daughter's next move—already plotting to ambush Guan Yu upon his return.
