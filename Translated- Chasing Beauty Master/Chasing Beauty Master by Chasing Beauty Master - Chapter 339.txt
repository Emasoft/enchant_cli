“Nurse, we’re not changing rooms, and I don’t want these clothes either. Take them away!”

Wen Ya suddenly spoke up, her tone icy and detached.

At first glance, she knew the upgraded room and clothes were Guan Yu’s doing. Yet his overbearing “generosity” only deepened her resentment. It felt as though she’d become his kept woman—a humiliation that clawed at her pride.

“But… the person who sent these said he won’t take them back,” the nurse stammered, bewildered.

“Then I’ll give them to *you*,” Wen Ya replied flatly.

Her mother, Mei Fanglan, snatched the clothes back. “How could you toss such expensive clothes? Since when did my frugal daughter become so wasteful?” She turned to the nurse, smiling. “We’ll take the new room.”

“Mom, this is *Guan Yu’s* charity. We don’t need his pity!” Wen Ya argued, eyes red.

“Aren’t we already accepting his help? Or will you make me leave the hospital now?” Mei Fanglan retorted.

Wen Ya fell silent. The bitter truth hung between them—they relied on Guan Yu’s money. Defeated, she relented.

In another ward, Bald Qiang lay bandaged and broken, staring blankly at the ceiling. After Guan Yu’s brutal retaliation for attacking Wen Ya, his manhood hung by a thread—literally.

“Even if you’re not a man, you’d make a lousy woman,” Guan Yu mocked, striding in with Luo Cheng.

Bald Qiang winced. “I’ll… adjust my preferences.”

“Shut up. I said I’d fix you.” Guan宇’s hands glowed faintly as his healing system activated, channeling energy into Bald Qiang’s ruined body.

Twenty minutes later, Guan宇 wiped his hands. “Follow my prescriptions. In a month, you’ll be a man again.”

“Thank you, Boss. My life’s yours now,” Bald Qiang vowed.

Guan宇 waved him off. “Just keep your thugs in line. If Wen雅’s bothered again, I’ll send you to Thailand myself.”

Back at the dorm, Wen雅 sat listlessly. Her roommate Chen Si perked up. “Your dad’s better? That doctor’s a miracle worker!”

Wen雅 forced a smile. Her parents’ recovery *was* miraculous—yet it shackled her deeper to Guan宇’s control.

“Come clubbing tonight!” Chen Si begged. “My birthday bash in Jiangnan!”

“No.” Wen雅 turned away. She wouldn’t play pawn in Chen Si’s matchmaking games. Not when every “gift” from Guan宇 felt like chains.
