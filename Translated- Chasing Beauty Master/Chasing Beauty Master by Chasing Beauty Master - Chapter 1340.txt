“In truth, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong were merely bickering idly for amusement, not taking those insignificant minions before them seriously at all.

Xiaobao watched from the side, puzzled. Were these two quarreling out of fear? They’d likely escalate their spat and flee. But after assaulting Young Master Qin, they couldn’t be allowed to escape.

“What are you all standing around for? Hurry up and seize them! Don’t let them escape!” Xiaobao barked. At her command, the six or seven men immediately moved to act.

Guan Yu glared furiously at Xiaobao. This lowly technician had stirred up far more trouble than anticipated. Today’s chaos owed entirely to her meddling.

Wang Xiaorong, unbothered by the escalating situation, grinned. “Seven of them. I’ll handle three—you take four.”

“Enough chatter!” Guan Yu snapped as the lackeys closed in. He lashed out with a kick, sending one unfortunate soul sprawling.

To his astonishment, the force of his strike sent the man flying. Only then did he realize his inner energy had somehow become accessible.

Elated, Guan Yu channeled his qi. With crackling energy, his figure blurred as he dispatched all seven attackers in rapid succession—one precise kick per man, clean and ruthless.

Wang Xiaorong stared, awestruck. During their confrontation with the Blood Lord at Blackblood Ridge, Guan Yu hadn’t displayed such speed—especially while gravely wounded.

Could he have progressed so dramatically in such brief time? She vividly recalled him wielding advanced magical artifacts at Blackblood Ridge, yet now he’d felled seven armed brutes empty-handed in moments. Was the dual cultivation of magic and martial arts truly this terrifying?

From her vantage point upstairs, Xi Liu observed Guan Yu’s display with widening eyes. “I mistook him for a mere scholar last we met,” she murmured. “But these movements reveal profound cultivation. An extraordinary figure... I pray he doesn’t become our adversary.”

Cuihua beside her gazed at Guan Yu with starstruck eyes, marveling at his prowess.

Xiaobao gaped as her men writhed on the floor. This scholarly-looking youth had dismantled them effortlessly.

Qin Taijin’s jaw hung slack enough to swallow an egg. Through drunken haze, he’d only glimpsed flickering movements before his men fell. Cold dread seeped into his wine-fogged mind.

“Stumbled upon iron today,” he cursed inwardly. Though unaccustomed to fear in Qujiang City, memories surfaced of past indiscretions—nearly killed after provoking women from the Strange Demon Cave. His father’s costly negotiations to placate them...

Today’s blunder echoed that disaster. Drunken lust for a pretty face had unleashed calamity. Visions of snake pits and torture resurfaced.

“Guards! More guards! Don’t let them near me!” Qin Taijin screeched, cowering behind Xiaobao.

“A grown man hiding behind a girl?” Wang Xiaorong taunted. “Do you even count as a man?”

Guan Yu noted her habitual challenge to masculinity. Did she doubt every man’s virility?

As Xiaobao’s cries summoned a dozen more enforcers from Echo Pavilion’s shadows, Guan Yu chuckled. “Quite the infestation of lackeys.”

“You could handle thrice their number,” Wang Xiaarong retorted.

Xi Liu descended gracefully, intervening before bloodshed escalated. “Stand down.”

Chapter 3463: Growth and Expansion

Recognizing Guan Yu’s overwhelming advantage, Xi Liu addressed the crowd: “Young Mistress Rong, it’s been years. You’ve blossomed into your mother’s likeness.”

“Indeed,” Wang Xiaorong replied with edged warmth. “Father searched for your Strange Demon Cave sisters endlessly. We’d thought the Twin Demon Queens perished from their wounds.”

Xi Liu’s smile tightened. “Our recovery took decades, but we endure. Please... don’t inform your father of our presence here.”

As they parried, Qin Taijin attempted to slink away.

“Fleeing after using a girl as shield?” Guan Yu thundered, freezing the drunkard mid-creep.

Xi Liu interceded: “Young Master, Young Mistress—he’s my patron. Drunken folly spurred his offense. Spare him this once, for my sake.”

“What worth does this fool hold?” Wang Xiaarong demanded.

“The Qin family’s influence could shutter this establishment,” Xi Liu murmured. Behind her, Echo Pavilion’s true nature stood revealed—not mere brothel, but stronghold of the Strange Demon Cave’s surviving disciples.

Chapter 3464: Granting Face

Wang Xiaarong’s laughter tinkled. “Father will rejoice to find your sect thriving here.”

Xi Liu’s plea carried desperation: “I beg you—keep our secret. We’ve built this refuge over years...”

Their history unfurled—the Strange Demon Cave’s near-annihilation in the Great Sect Wars, their seclusion in deserts and mountains to evade persecution. Of the four demonic splinter groups, only the Demon Soul Sect openly flourished while others lurked in shadows.

Guan Yu pieced together the puzzle: Echo Pavilion’s maids, cooks, even performers—all disciples in disguise. The Twin Demon Queens’ survival explained their resurgence.

Qin Taijin trembled, realizing his drunken prey had become the spider at the web’s center. As sect politics swirled, his fate hung on the Young Mistress’ whim.

Wang Xiaarong studied Xi Liu. “Why conceal yourselves from Father? United, we could—”

“Our paths diverged long ago,” Xi Liu interrupted. “We seek only peaceful livelihood now.” Her gaze flicked to Qin Taijin, then back. “Grant this face, Young Mistress. Let the drunkard go.”

Guan Yu crossed his arms. “Your ‘patron’ deserves a lesson.”

Yet Wang Xiaarong waved dismissively. “For old times’ sake—the toy you gifted me as a child. But heed this, Qin Taijin...” Her voice turned glacial. “Touch another unwilling woman, and not even ten Strange Demon Caves will save you.”

The threat hung as Xi Liu bowed gratitude. In the fragile dance of demonic sects, today’s confrontation settled—but the game’s pieces now stood revealed.
