“Second to Wolf” asked, “Is Chief Dai sending wine over later? She mentioned before that she’d give me some good liquor to try, but I didn’t expect her to take this long to remember.”

Xiao Zhi hastily explained, “No, it’s because when Guan Yu visited earlier, he told Elder Dai you’d been feeling down lately and needed more wine. That’s why she ordered disciples to fetch some for you.”

**Chapter 3,296: A Spectacle**

Second to Wolf nodded. “Ah, so that’s how it is. Seems my reputation carries weight – having it delivered right to my door! Isn’t this splendid? I was just thinking this jar of wine would barely last one barbecue session. Now that Chief Dai’s personally sending more, our next gathering’s secured.”

Soon, Aze arrived, and the four idly chatted in the room while awaiting the promised wine from Gathering Summit.

“Guan Yu, how did your duel go today? Manage to keep up?” Aze inquired first, knowing Guan Yu lacked conventional magic beyond his speed and the Emperor’s Seal techniques.

Truth be told, Aze longed to witness Guan Yu unleash the Emperor’s Seal – those supreme spells promised terrifying spectacle and dazzling effects.

Xiao Zhi interjected excitedly, “Let me tell it! You’ve never seen such an epic clash! From the start, they traded relentless attacks and defenses. While other duels had cheering crowds, the entire audience watched theirs in dead silence – not a single whisper!”

“Really? That intense?” Aze’s eyes sparkled. “Now I regret missing it!”

Guan Yu remained silent as Xiao Zhi spun his tale: “After their war of words – literal spittle flying everywhere – Guan Yu lost a magic artifact and owed a personal favor!”

“What?!” Aze gaped. “A shouting match? Losing treasure and owing favors? This sounds absurd!”

Second to Wolf chuckled mischievously. “Don’t tell me you gambled the Emperor’s Seal? Though I’d wager your opponent was quite the looker.”

“Spot on, Brother Second! Xiao Tong’s beauty is undeniable,” Xiao Zhi grinned lewdly.

Aze pressed, “Xiao Zhi, give the real account. What actually happened?”

“This is the truth! Even if I retold it ten times, it’d stay the same. When Xiao Tong was about to cast her spell, Guan Yu dashed over, grabbed her hand, and whispered something that made her flee blushing. That’s how it ended.”

Aze turned to Guan Yu incredulously. “He’s exaggerating, right? Though it does sound... theatrically impressive.”

“Take it as entertainment,” Guan Yu smiled wryly. “Reality was far more complicated.” He had no better explanation.

*Knock knock knock…*

Second to Wolf leapt from the bed. “Guan Yu, answer it! The wine’s here!”

Opening the door revealed Chief Dai herself with two disciples bearing three large jars. “Chief Dai, please come in,” Guan Yu welcomed politely.

The chief’s smile brightened upon seeing Second to Wolf. “Brother Second, hearing of your recent melancholy, I brought these fine vintages to lift your spirits.”

“Ah, Chief Dai knows me well! I’ve been thirsting for good drink. Such generosity, delivered personally – I’m humbled.”

“No need for formalities between sworn siblings,” she replied, directing her disciples to place the jars.

“Should you need anything else, Brother Second, don’t hesitate. We’re family here.” With that, Chief Dai took her leave, escorted out by Guan Yu.

As Guan Yu turned back, a familiar voice called: “Guan Yu! Over here!”

Wang Jun beckoned from a corner. Approaching, Guan Yu noted, “Long time no see. What brings you?”

“Could we speak privately?” Wang Jun requested.

Leading Wang Jun to Second to Wolf’s vacant room, Guan Yu inquired, “After disappearing from City A, we feared the worst. Yet here you are?”

“Fate works strangely,” Wang Jun sighed. “After you and Xue Jing rejected me... I couldn’t stay. Wandered until hunters brought me here. A magical beast attack left me the sole survivor. Elder Mu of Bamboo Peak saved me, recognizing my talent despite...” Wang Jun trailed off.

Guan Yu cut to the chase: “But Bamboo Peak doesn’t accept female disciples. How?”

Wang Jun met his gaze. “Because I’m a man now.”

“Impossible! I knew you as a woman!”

“That’s why I’m here,” Wang Jun pleaded. “Please keep my past secret. Elder Mu knows – he helped me transition.”

Guan Yu’s jaw dropped. “You underwent... surgery? Why?”

“Rejection broke me. I sought reinvention abroad. The procedure... had complications.” Wang Jun’s pained expression spoke volumes. “Infection left... lingering issues. Elder Mu provides medicine, but the shame...”

Guan Yu absorbed this quietly. “Your secret’s safe with me. But why such drastic change?”

“I wanted... new perspective. Now I regret it. This place lets me rebuild away from past judgments.”

Nodding solemnly, Guan Yu vowed discretion. As Wang Jun departed, Guan Yu mused on life’s unpredictable turns, the aroma of aged wine beckoning him back to camaraderie and the night’s revelries.
