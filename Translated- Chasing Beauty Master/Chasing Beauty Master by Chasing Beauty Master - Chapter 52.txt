Feng Xin pursed her lips in a subtle smile, though inwardly she felt puzzled. This guy truly carried an air of mystery—impressive! The porcelain vase in her office being a replica wasn’t too surprising for him to discern, especially since it had shattered, revealing its material.

But this newly acquired incense burner had been genuinely procured through keen judgment! While Guan Yu dismissed it as mere luck to fool others, she knew better. The desperation he showed scrambling for sixty thousand yuan spoke volumes.

Hmm… an enigma of a man! Feng Xin grinned to herself.

She slowly started the car and drove away from the bank.

In a white van behind them, several rough-looking middle-aged men exchanged glances and nodded. “Follow them. That bag in the kid’s hands must hold at least several hundred thousand!”

These men, stationed outside the bank, had coincidentally locked onto Guan Yu’s bag—the one containing two hundred thousand.

Unaware of their pursuers, Guan Yu chatted casually with the elderly man in the backseat.

“Where do you live, old-timer?” Guan Yu turned slightly to ask.

“Huarui Residential Area in the western suburbs,” the old man replied distractedly, using his expensive shirt sleeve to polish grime off the incense burner.

**Chapter 124: The Robbers**

Guan Yu felt no particular concern, being unfamiliar with the area. But Feng Xin, driving, stiffened. She glanced suspiciously at the old man through the rearview mirror and pursed her lips. Crunch—

Huarui Residential Area—a suburban enclave of wealthy villas. Its residents were anything but ordinary. No wonder the old man could casually spend over a million without blinking.

As they left the city for the western suburbs, traffic thinned noticeably.

“Hmm?” Feng Xin frowned. Since passing the overpass, a white van had tailed them persistently.

Could they be the old man’s bodyguards? But why would he need their ride then? Suppressing her doubts, she stayed silent.

Minutes later, the van abruptly accelerated, pulling alongside them to overtake.

The desolate industrial area, empty at dusk, heightened Feng Xin’s unease. She slammed the gas, surging forward.

“Sir, is that van your security detail?” Feng Xin asked sharply.

The old man looked up, bewildered. “I never use bodyguards. I took the bus here. Why?”

“Guan Yu, hand me my phone!” Feng Xin ordered.

“What’s wrong?”

“We’re being followed.”

Guan Yu blinked, mind racing. Was this a robbery? A vendetta?

Following Feng Xin’s instructions, he dialed her contacts.

“I’m being tailed en route to Huarui. Send backup. Unknown assailants,” Feng Xin briefed tersely.

The old man, now alert, pulled out his own phone. “A-Qiang, I might need assistance. Contact Junzi.”

Guan Yu tried activating his Detection Technique, but the speeding cars disrupted it.

At a factory intersection, a tractor-trailer suddenly veered right. Feng Xin swerved hard, avoiding collision.

“You lunatic! Rich brats think you own the road—” The truck driver’s curses died as the white van blocked Feng Xin’s car. Masked men wielding shotguns and submachine guns stormed out.

“Out! Now!”

Feng Xin trembled, gripping the wheel. A thug smashed his shotgun against her window, but the reinforced Mercedes glass held.

“Down!” Guan Yu yanked Feng Xin into the passenger seat as gunfire erupted. Bullets shattered the rear window, grazing his scalp.

**Chapter 125: Brink of Death**

Had he moved slower, Guan Yu’s skull would’ve exploded. Blood seeped from his scorched scalp.

Survival instinct kicked in. Grabbing the attacker’s arm through the window, Guan Yu snapped his elbow with a gravity-enhanced strike. Bone shards pierced fabric as he wrenched the man’s throat, crushing it.

Seizing a fallen submachine gun, Guan Yu fired blindly to suppress the others. “Drive, Xin!”

As Feng Xin restarted the engine, a fleet of black vans swarmed in. Twenty-armed Fire Gang members surrounded the robbers.

“Drop your weapons!” a bald enforcer barked.

The remaining thugs surrendered. Feng Xin slumped, pallid. “Secure them. Find out who they are.”

Another convoy arrived—Liu Jun, the round-faced gang leader from last night’s banquet, brandishing shotguns.

“Stand down!” The old man emerged, transformed from cowering passenger to authority. “Useless! I’d be dead without this boy!”

Liu Jun shrank under his uncle’s glare. The old man clasped Guan Yu’s hands. “You saved my life!”

Guan Yu forced a smile, fingering his wounded scalp. Around him, the Fire Gang and Liu’s men stood armed, unfazed. Envy stirred—he wanted such power.

**Chapter 126: Justifiable Defense**

Staring at the corpse he’d made, Guan Yu lit a shaky cigarette. First kill.

“It’s self-defense. You’re clean,” Feng Xin reassured.

The old man effusively thanked Guan Yu while berating Liu Jun. Guan Yu watched the gangs, resolve hardening. He’d build his own empire—one where survival didn’t hinge on others.
