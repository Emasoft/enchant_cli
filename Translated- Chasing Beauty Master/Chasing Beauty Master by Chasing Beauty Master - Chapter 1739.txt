Xiaomei's felt tent had been specially reinforced. When the Heterodox Sect had previously camped here, her tent stood significantly larger than others, with multiple reinforced and thickened sections. While other tents used one or two layers of animal hides...

Xiaomei's tent boasted four layers of hides, all secured with thickened wooden stakes, making it exceptionally sturdy. In such ferocious weather, her shelter undoubtedly outperformed others that risked being shredded by gales, while hers could withstand far greater winds.

Guan Yu declared, “This won’t do. The storm worsens by the minute—I must check on the others to ease my mind.” Siqi watched him anxiously, sharing his concern yet uncertain how to dissuade him. Venturing out posed grave dangers, but staying meant abandoning their companions to peril, leaving her torn.

Rising to his feet, Guan Yu addressed Xiaomei, “If opportunity allows, I’ll bring everyone here. I know you disapprove, but state your terms now if you have any.” For the sake of others’ safety, Guan Yu cared little for cost. Silver was his only bargaining chip, and if it sufficed, all the better.

Xiaomei hesitated. She loathed hosting visitors—firstly, as a demon kin, she avoided human company, and secondly, she prized cleanliness above all. Even within the Heterodox Sect, none dared enter her tent without permission, conducting business at the entrance. Allowing Guan Yu and Siqi inside already stretched her tolerance. Now accommodating twenty more? Unthinkable, even if their lives hung in the balance.

Before she could refuse, Guan Yu produced a silver note, offering, “Take this as payment for your hospitality.” Xiaomei was no fool—she instantly recognized the hundred-tael note. In desert life, where survival hinged on trading scarce resources, such sum held immense allure.

Without hesitation, she snatched the note, scrutinizing it for authenticity. “With this silver, I’ll fetch the others. Consider it a transaction,” Guan Yu declared, already striding out as the storm brooked no delay.

Siqi leapt up, pleading, “Wait! Let me accompany you—I can help!” Guan Yu paused, turning back. “For my peace of mind, stay. Trust me, as I trust you to remain safe.”

**Chapter 4549: Fiery Temper**

“Wait here calmly. I swear I’ll return unharmed,” Guan Yu vowed. As he reached the entrance, Xiaomei called sharply, “Hold!” Noting his urgency, she gestured to a corner where a straw raincoat hung. “For the silver’s sake, wear that. It repels rain and cold.”

Nodding, Guan Yu donned the coat and plunged into the tempest. Siqi stared futilely into the murk, while elsewhere, Wang Jun and Aze’s group huddled in their failing tent, instruments forgotten. “They say desert storms are fickle,” Wang Jun muttered, “but a sandstorm paired with torrents? Our luck’s rotten.”

Aze gripped his magic brush. “Stay vigilant. At the first sign of collapse, we cast protective spells.” As if summoned, the tent’s side撕裂 open, the gap widening ominously.

Outside, Guan Yu crawled blindly through howling winds, guided by memory until he collided with a tent—only to find the camel pen half-destroyed, beasts panicked and tethered. No time—he pressed on.

Bursting into Wang Jun’s tent as they prepared spells, Guan Yu,草帽 askew, shouted over the gale: “Abandon this ruin! Follow me!” He secured a rope to the central post, instructing, “Tether yourselves and crawl to Xiaomei’s tent!”

**Chapter 4550: No Issues**

Wang Jun led the line, belt lashed to the lifeline. The sidewind battered them—he resorted to crawling. Aze, sturdier, trudged on. Most followed cleverly, using the rope’s leverage against the gale.

Reaching Xiaomei’s intact shelter, relief turned to dread as three stragglers vanished. Guan Yu swallowed the loss. “Dry yourselves by the fire,” he ordered, though all knew the missing were doomed.

A bereaved brother confronted Guan Yu: “Why stop our spells? Your plan failed!” Guan Yu countered, “Spells would’ve drained us within hours. This tent endures—we saved many.” Wang Jun added, “Some fates can’t be changed.”

Xiaomei coldly remarked, “You’re here on silver’s grace. Rejoice in living.”

**Chapter 4551: Holding Firm**

As the storm raged, the group huddled around flames, clothes steaming. Siqi whispered, “What now?” Before Guan Yu answered, tension simmered—grief and gratitude warring under the demon’s roof, while outside, the desert roared its indifference.
