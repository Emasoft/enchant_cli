“These two scoundrels are truly birds of a feather! Today, this grandpa will eliminate both of you to rid our people of this scourge!”

After receiving a meaningful glance from Kyle, Locke stood up and offered a feigned mediation: “Ah, Elder Kyle, as a senior council member, you shouldn’t speak to our clan leader like this. Elder Allen has served as our chieftain for over a decade. Even without grand achievements, his years of dedication count for something. Wouldn’t you agree?”

Watching their orchestrated performance, Allen inwardly sneered. In truth, ever since Locke’s breakthrough to Grand Mage two years prior, Kyle had sought to elevate him—partly out of resentment for losing the chieftain position to Allen, and partly due to their familial ties.

Two years ago, Locke had still been a promising youth—gifted and kind-hearted. Yet under Kyle’s instigation, he had grown increasingly corrupted, now irreversibly treading a dark path.

Their longstanding coveting of the chieftaincy troubled Allen deeply. Were their intentions noble, he would gladly relinquish power. But their selfishness and belligerence threatened to plunge the elven race back into war’s shadow—a catastrophic prospect.

“Speak your mind plainly, Kyle,” Allen declared coldly. “I, Allen, have lived with integrity, never betraying our kin. Leading our people is no simple task. If you find fault in my governance, voice it openly. But if you scheme in shadows, do not blame me for showing no mercy!”

Though ostensibly directed at Kyle, Allen’s words served as a warning to all present: any covert treachery would be met with ruthless consequence.

Allen’s authority stemmed not only from his rank but his superior cultivation. Among the five elven elders, three stood at peak Archmage level, while two reached Archmage Three Stars. Though Locke, as guardian captain, was merely an Archmage One Star, his youth—half the elders’ age—made him formidable.

Allen alone had attained the Grand Archmage tier. While conventional wisdom held that a Grand Archmage could match three Archmages, real combat variables defied such simplifications.

After Allen’s warning, the tense atmosphere eased slightly. The chieftain nodded, though unease lingered. Among the five elders, only one staunchly supported him; the other four sided with Locke. In a fair fight, Allen could handle two against five—but subterfuge might tip the scales.

**Chapter 1284: Forcing the Palace**

The fragile calm soon shattered as an opposing elder rose. “Elder Allen, I’ve long withheld my thoughts. Since you invited candid critique, I shall speak.”

Meeting the assembly’s gazes, he continued: “Decades ago, we elves surpassed humans in strength. We taught them to fuse swordcraft with magic, birthing their current cultivation system. Yet once empowered, they repaid us by plundering our Life Source and abducting our kin. The wars that followed cost both sides dearly.”

“Though peace came, humans still harass us, even stealing our maidens. How often have we pleaded for action? Yet you turn blind eyes to their insults! You may tolerate this humiliation—I cannot!”

His impassioned speech stirred murmurs of agreement. Unfazed, Allen replied, “Some realities transcend desire. In my position, you’d understand.”

Seeing confused expressions, he elaborated: “You advocate retaliating in kind—raiding human cities, enslaving their people? Is that righteous?”

As silence fell, Allen pressed: “I share your hatred of human brutality. But recklessness would sacrifice countless elves—elders and children alike!”

“Must we endlessly retreat?” the elder countered. “Our descendants deserve dignity, not perpetual victimhood!”

Allen sighed. His restraint aimed to protect the young—yet now it branded him a coward.

“Admit your weakness!” another voice jeered. “Stop hiding behind excuses for incompetence!”

The attacks escalated—from accusations of failure to outright charges of cowardice. As the slander peaked, Locke rose with feigned diplomacy: “Honored elders, as junior among you, I’m humbled to participate. Both perspectives hold merit—the chieftain’s caution preserves peace, while the elders seek elven pride. Perhaps we might table this debate?”

“What do you propose?” Kyle prompted theatrically.

Observing their act, Guan Yu (Dragon Scion) seethed. Their scheming reeked of treachery.

Locke smiled. “Our gravest crisis is the dwindling Life Source—the font of magic for fledgling elves and sustenance for adults. Should it perish, our race faces extinction within decades.”

Nods of grim agreement circled the room.

“Therefore,” Locke declared, “whoever solves this crisis shall lead as chieftain!”

Stunned silence followed. The conspirators exchanged furtive glances, awaiting Allen’s outburst.

“Hahaha! So this charade finally surfaces!” Allen laughed mirthlessly. “I’ve wearied of leadership anyway. But Locke—have you any solution?”

Locke smirked. “The Crystal Toad alone can rejuvenate the Life Source. But its emergence cycles every fifty years. Since Guan Yu squandered this cycle’s chance, we must wait five decades.”

This twist unsettled Guan Yu. A schemer like Locke wouldn’t propose unfavorable terms—there had to be hidden machinations.

Allen’s heart clenched. Days had passed without word from Guan Yu. Yesterday, rumors spread that the dragonkin had died chasing the Crystal Toad—plunged off a cliff during conflict. Though unverified, the news haunted him. If true, he’d bear lifelong guilt—especially towards his daughter Amy, who’d wept inconsolably for her “dragon brother.”

**Chapter 1285: Return**

“Then our debate is meaningless,” a elder sighed.

“Not entirely,” Locke countered. “We might trace the cause of the Life Source’s decline.”

Kyle stood, glaring at Allen. “I don’t know causes—only which chieftain presided over its ruin. For ten millennia our ancestors safeguarded the Source. Now, under your watch...”

The implication hung heavy. Allen bit back retorts—the crisis had indeed occurred during his tenure.

Outside, Guan Yu watched anxiously through a window. He knew truths but hesitated to intervene without understanding Allen’s plans.

“Who are you? Why spy at father’s door?”

Turning, Guan Yu found Amy wide-eyed behind him.

“Dragon brother! Is it really you?”

Hushing her excitement, Guan Yu beckoned her closer. The girl rushed over, inspecting him with joyful disbelief despite his ragged state.

“They said you died! I thought—never mind! You’re here!”

Her chatter inevitably drew attention. “Who’s there?!” barked a voice within.

Resigned, Guan Yu entered with Amy. The assembly gaped—Locke paling in shock.

“Impossible! You...how?!”

“Disappointed I survived?” Guan Yu coldly smiled. “Last night, I met someone remarkably like you—same face, voice, but far more vile. Not you, surely?”

Locke forced a grin. “I’ve been here all along! Glad you’re unharmed!”

“My mistake then.” Guan Yu gripped Locke’s bandaged arm—the very wound he’d inflicted—squeezing viciously. “I’ll have my eyes checked. Now, about solving the Life Source crisis...”

“I support Guan Yu!” Allen interjected.

Outrage erupted. “He’s no elf!” Locke protested. “An outsider can’t lead!”

**Chapter 1286: Qualifications**

“Peace,” Guan Yu raised a hand. “I seek only clarity. By your terms, solving the crisis grants leadership—regardless of race?”

“Never!” Kyle snarled. “We’ll never let outsiders scheme against us!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Old man, must you bark? Can’t we converse civilly?”

“You—!”
