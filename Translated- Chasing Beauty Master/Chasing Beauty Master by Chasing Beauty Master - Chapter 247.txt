This is a classic case of unnecessary worry. To be honest, Guan Yu had completely forgotten about the security guard after passing through the main entrance.

Such is life—the small struggle desperately at the bottom, while the great remain unbothered by trivialities.

During the journey, Lin Feng explained Mo Kai's internal operations in detail. Since Xiao Xiong's first words upon returning were, "I now work for someone else," Lin Feng took extra care to outline every aspect of the company with meticulous clarity for Guan Yu.

The deeper the explanation went, the more Guan Yu admired Xiao Xiong.

The Mo Kai Group occupied a 66-story tower—over a dozen floors higher than Guan Yu's estimate of fifty-something. The corporation's vast business portfolio spanned numerous industries. While not leading in every field, it held significant influence across all sectors.

Their financial performance was staggering, with annual sales reaching 2 to 2.5 billion. Guan Yu, currently strapped for cash, couldn't help feeling envious.

Yet envy aside, he harbored no thoughts of seizing anything.

When Lin Feng hinted these assets might someday belong to Guan Yu, the young man firmly rejected the idea. He wouldn't snatch away the empire Xiao Xiong had painstakingly built like some ungrateful wolf.

He'd merely saved Xiao Xiong's life once, just as he'd spared Lin Feng. By that logic, didn't Lin Feng's life belong to him too?

When Guan Yu used this analogy, Lin Feng chuckled awkwardly, his estimation of the young man rising another notch.

Their private elevator ascended directly to the penthouse.

"How spectacular!" Guan Yu marveled at the panoramic city view through floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Boss, building this high is just pretentious showing-off. What's the point?" Niu Le muttered from a safe distance, his tone dripping disdain.

Guan Yu turned to the visibly tense man and teased, "Don't cry sour grapes. Who knew you'd be such a coward?"

He couldn't suppress a laugh.

Despite Niu Le's bullish nickname, the man suffered from crippling acrophobia. The elevator ride hadn't bothered him, but the transparent walls of the summit left the "ox" trembling. No amount of dragging could make him join Guan Yu in appreciating the "overlooking all beneath heaven" grandeur—a display Guan Yu found utterly contemptible.

Niu Le bristled. "If there's a fire or explosion up here, there's zero chance of escape. That's not pretentious?"

"Enough nonsense," Guan Yu snapped, before his brows lifted. "They're coming."

Upon reaching the top floor, Lin Feng had settled Guan Yu in a lounge before reporting to Xiao Xiong. The boss was strategizing with core members against Cheng Gui's offensive—a discussion likely to continue—leaving Guan Yu to wait.

As a core member himself, Lin Feng's absence from the meeting signaled higher priorities. When pressed for details, he deferred to Xiao Xiong's authority.

Guan Yu chose not to pursue it.

"Younger Brother Guan! You should've notified me earlier—I'd have greeted you properly!" boomed a familiar voice before its owner appeared.

Turning, Guan Yu saw Xiao Xiong striding forward. The man seemed more grounded than during their first meeting—broad-shouldered, steady-paced, his resolute features softened by a genuine smile.

Guan Yu smiled back.

Unshaken under pressure, Xiao Xiong radiated the aura of a seasoned leader.

"Brother Xiao, my abrupt visit was thoughtless. I'll punish myself with three drinks later," Guan Yu offered.

"Excellent! I've waited too long for this. We drink till dawn!" Xiao Xiong laughed, settling opposite him.

"But first," his tone turned serious, "we must discuss business."

Straightening, Guan Yu glanced at the four men behind Xiao Xiong. "I'm listening."

Xiao Xiong nodded gravely. "You saved my life. I've never forgotten my promise. Now I fulfill it—from today, you lead Mo Kai as its new master."

Three of the four men behind him exchanged troubled glances, minds racing. Only Lin Feng remained composed.

His prior interactions with Guan Yu made him uniquely positioned to understand Xiao Xiong's decision.

**Chapter 619: Doubts**

Though Lin Feng had forewarned him, the proclamation still shocked Guan Yu.

"Brother Xiao, that was just casual talk. No need for..."

Xiao Xiong's expression darkened. "My word is iron. What's promised is done—Mo Kai is yours."

"Brother—"

"Enough!" Xiao Xiong cut him off. "This decision stands. Mo Kai faces existential threats—it needs your leadership to survive."

Guan Yu grimaced. The Xiao Xiong he knew was prudent—why force this corporate colossus upon him, risking instability?

"Brother, this is reckless! You'd hand our life's work to an outsider?" protested one of the four lieutenants.

Xiao Xiong's gaze hardened. "I've never broken faith with my brothers. That remains true."

"But this jeopardizes everyone! The men won't accept some greenhorn, especially during crisis! Changing leadership now invites chaos—it could destroy Mo Kai!"

"I've considered this," Xiao Xiong replied calmly. "But I trust Guan Yu's capability. He'll navigate these waters."

The man reddened. "Capability? A twenty-year-old whelp leading Mo Kai? Madness!"

"Madness?" Xiao Xiong's voice turned icy. "Who pulled me from six months' imprisonment? While you lot burned cash for nothing, he succeeded. If he's unworthy, what does that make you?"

"That just means he has powerful connections!" the man retorted weakly.

"Aren't strong connections precisely what we lack against Cheng Gui?" Xiao Xiong countered.

Another lieutenant stepped forward. "Connections don't equal competence. I refuse to bow to someone young enough to call me uncle!"

"Does youth negate ability?" Xiao Xiong's eyes narrowed.

"There's no evidence of his competence!"

"What proof would satisfy you?"

The man hesitated. "There's no fixed measure... It must be demonstrated through action."

"Deny him the chance, and you'll never know," Xiao Xiong said evenly.

"This isn't the time for chances! Mo Kai's survival hangs by a thread—we can't gamble!"

Xiao Xiong leaned forward. "Have you observed him? True, his youth unsettles you. But I tell you now—he surpasses us all. Without him, Mo Kai likely falls. That's why he's here."

"Better than us? I, Chen Yu, challenge that!"

"Cui Jian seconds this!" another joined.

"Wang Jun?" Xiao Xiong turned to the silent figure.

The man rumbled, "I trust our leader."

Lin Feng, unsurprisingly excluded from the poll, bit his tongue.

"Very well," Xiao Xiong smiled. "Let your objections be tested. Lose, and you submit. Win, and I retract everything."

After exchanged glances, the two challengers nodded. Chen Yu stepped forward first.

Xiao Xiong rose. "The office has better space. Follow me."

As the group moved, Lin Feng hung back with Guan Yu. "Thrash Chen Yu thoroughly—he deserves it."

Guan Yu chuckled. "What if I'm the one thrashed?"

Lin Feng rolled his eyes—he'd witnessed Guan Yu's combat prowess firsthand, even against firearms.

Guan Yu's gaze lingered on Xiao Xiong's back. This trial was clearly orchestrated to legitimize his leadership. The boss was determined to pass the torch.

**Chapter 620: The Five Tigers**

Hearing the challenge terms, Chen Yu and Cui Jian exchanged puzzled yet eager looks.

"Brother," Cui Jian voiced their confusion, "you want Guan Yu to face Chen Yu in combat and me in strategy?"

"Would you yield unless defeated in your strongest fields?" Xiao Xiong countered.

The two hid smirks. Chen Yu ranked second in combat among the "Five Tigers," while Cui Jian's strategic mind was unmatched. This seemed an easy victory.

Their confidence masked deeper concerns—as founding members, they'd rather die than see Mo Kai handed to an untested youth.

Xiao Xiong turned to Guan Yu. "Do you play weiqi?"

Resisting the urge to kick him, Guan Yu replied, "A little."

His winter visits to Old Man Feng's tea-and-chess sessions, combined with his cheating "insight" ability, had honed unexpected skills.

"Good enough," Xiao Xiong declared. "Begin with Chen Yu."

As the group filed out, Lin Feng whispered, "Humiliate him properly."

Guan Yu smiled wryly, eyeing the challengers. Lin Feng had briefed him earlier—the Five Tigers included:

Chen Yu: Blunt and hot-tempered.

Cui Jian: Cunning yet loyal.

Wang Jun: Silent strategist—"still as a hound, fierce as a tiger."

The real test was about to begin.
