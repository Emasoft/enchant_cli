Some patients still refused to rest, conversing with their families. Du Bingyan's parents lay innermost, their bodies still without any vital signs, their breathing imperceptibly slow.

Du Bingyan had initially been in good spirits tonight, having acquired substantial silver. Even if those Yunqing Sect disciples with magical arts couldn't cure her parents, the silver would at least cover their medical expenses for a while.

Her daily routine involved keeping vigil at her parents' bedside. Wealthier families could afford hired caretakers, but Du Bingyan lacked such luxury. Beyond tending her parents, she returned home daily to feed chickens - the hens provided eggs for market, a meager but steady income.

Tonight, something felt wrong. The figures on the bed seemed barely alive. When she touched their foreheads, panic seized her - burning fevers. She rushed for the physician.

The awakened doctor grumbled, "What's the matter? All this shouting and clamoring."

"Physician, my parents... their fevers won't break. Please examine them," Du Bingyan pleaded.

The physician yawned lazily, "I've warned you for days - no payment, no treatment. This isn't a charity. Their medicine was stopped today - of course they'd burn up."

"But I begged for one more day! Here's the silver - please hurry!"

Glancing at the dark sky, the physician complained, "Look how late you've come!" His expression softened upon counting the banknotes. "Very well. Wait here while I dress."

Chapter 3996: Beyond Saving

Du Bingyan paced anxiously, fearing irreversible damage. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi seized the moment to examine the elderly couple. Wang's spiritual energy probed their bodies - too late.

Internal organs rotted with complications, cerebral hemorrhages long untreated pressed on nerves - the true reason for their unresponsive state. Now the clotting had worsened beyond even divine intervention.

When Du Bingyan returned with the physician, Wang Jun shook his head and stepped aside. The doctor performed his examination - forehead palpation, tongue inspection. Then came foot-long acupuncture needles that made Wang Jun wince as they disappeared into skulls.

After extensive needling brought no improvement, the physician peeled back eyelids and sighed. "Too late. They won't survive sunset."

Dawn's first light crept across the horizon. The ever-resilient Du Bingyan muffled sobs with her palm, tears cascading silently. Her shuddering frame embodied utter desolation - a soul teetering at despair's precipice, hating her own helplessness.

If only she'd stolen or conned sooner! Now, collapsed in wracking sobs, months of pent-up anguish erupted. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi shared her grief - they'd arrived too late. Xiao Zhi embraced the weeping woman, his shoulder absorbing her tears.

The physician departed without malice - his clinic wasn't a charity, and he'd already extended fifteen days' credit. Du Bingyan's self-loathing intensified - failed daughter, drained family coffers, now facing destitution.

Suicidal thoughts flickered until Xiao Zhi's steady presence anchored her. Wang Jun privately considered this merciful release - sustaining two invalids would have crushed Du Bingyan's life.

"Parting is life's inevitable trial," Wang Jun counseled. "Let them go peacefully. Your own path awaits."

But Du Bingyan heard nothing through the storm of regret. Xiao Zhi remained her tear-soaked pillar until exhaustion set in. "Come, some fresh air might help," he urged gently.

"I'll stay," she whispered hoarsely. "This is their final journey."

Wang Jun pressed a gold leaf into her hand. "For funeral arrangements. Consider it a loan."

Chapter 3997: Departure at Dawn

Du Bingyan numbly accepted - last night's stolen silver had gone to the physician, leaving her penniless for proper rites.

"We must return," Wang Jun reminded Xiao Zhi. "Lord Zhou might depart early."

As they prepared to leave, Xiao Zhi blurted, "If you've nowhere else... come to Yunqing Sect. I... I wish to care for you." He fled before seeing her stunned expression.

Returning to their inn, they found Guan Yu still snoring. "We're early," Xiao Zhi observed.

"His Highness will send word when ready," Wang Jun yawned, collapsing onto bed. But a knock interrupted - the captain from Prince Zhou's retinue delivered a lacquered box.

"His Highness rests today. We depart tomorrow dawn. Tonight, a banquet in your honor."

Inside gleamed nine gold ingots and fine wine. "The prince's generosity!" Xiao Zhi marveled.

Wang Jun pounced. "Split three ways!"

"Guan Yu's wealthy beyond measure!" Wang Jun hissed. "Keep this between us!"

Temptation swayed Xiao Zhi's principles. They divided the gold, carefully replacing the wine.

Chapter 3998: Ingratitude

"Remember," Wang Jun warned, "try keeping it all and I'll tell Guan Yu!"

Xiao Zhi reluctantly agreed to uneven split - five ingots for himself, four for Wang Jun, ignoring the gold leaf given earlier.

Their whispered conspiracy continued, oblivious to Guan Yu stirring nearby. The gold's allure had eroded camaraderie, planting seeds of future discord.
