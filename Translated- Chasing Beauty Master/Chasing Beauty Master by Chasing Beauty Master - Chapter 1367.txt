“Stay behind me and try not to make any sound.” The group advanced quietly, fearful of encountering people from the Demon Soul Sect and Strange Demon Cave, desperately avoiding detection.

They arrived at an extraordinary space—no longer a cave nor cliff, but a lakeside. Guan Yu’s earlier guess proved correct: there indeed existed an underground lake.

Yet no illumination revealed the lake’s full expanse. Surrounding rocks framed the endless black waters stretching beyond sight. “This is terrible,” Xiao Zhi muttered. “How do we cross without boats? Swim?”

“One obstacle after another!” Aze complained. “What madness drove Ancestor Menghua to build this place? Was he deranged?”

With the path blocked ahead, gloom settled over the group. Guan Yu encouraged them: “Don’t panic. Since the Demon Soul Sect and Strange Demon Cave found a way, so shall we. Wait here while I scout.”

He moved rightward along the rocks, Wang Xiaorong swiftly following. “I’ll join you.” Guan Yu didn’t protest—amidst stones and water, danger seemed unlikely.

As they walked, Guan Yu asked: “Xiaorong, did you hear stories about Ancestor Menghua during your time in the Demon Soul Sect?”

“Not specifics,” she whispered, glancing around conspiratorially. “But I know this lake. We’re beneath Duobao Mountain now.”

“So the mountain stands atop a great lake?”

“Exactly. Legend says a millennium ago, this was Duobao Lake. Two divine cultivators punished two sacred beasts here—one imprisoned beneath the waters, the other under the mountain itself. The mountain was conjured through their magic, crushing the original lake beneath.”

“Marvelous,” Guan Yu marveled, though the tale differed slightly from versions he’d heard. Others spoke of two caverns housing the beasts, forever separated yet agonizingly close.

Wang Xiaorong continued: “Later, Ancestor Menghua sought to tame these beasts. Subduing a sacred beast brings immense power and prestige. Thus he built his underground palace here.”

“So he failed?” Guan Yu pressed. “Does a millennia-old beast still dwell here? Where’s Menghua’s palace?”

Wang Xiaorong pointed upward playfully. “Likely above us, or above the lake’s center.”

Their conversation halted at distant voices. Guan Yu signaled silence as they hid behind rocks.

“Left Envoy,” came Xi Liu’s voice, facing the Demon Soul Sect’s leader. “Since we meet here, shouldn’t fellow demonic factions cooperate? Must we shed blood?”

The Strange Demon Cave outnumbered their rivals—over twenty against the Demon Soul Sect’s depleted nineteen. Yet the Left Envoy stood unflinching. “You promised non-interference at Echo Pavilion, Xi Liu. This is betrayal.”

“We seek Ancestor Menghua’s legacy—the Eight-Sided Drum artifact. Your presence opposes the Demon Soul Sect’s interests.”

Xi Liu smiled diplomatically. “The orthodox sects approach. Shouldn’t we unite against them? Unless you’d prefer I ally with Cloudgreen Sect?”

“Dare collaborate with those hypocrites,” the Left Envoy growled, “and the Strange Demon Cave will be erased from existence.”

“Empty threats,” Xi Liu countered. “Fighting us weakens you for Cloudgreen’s arrival. My sisters number many in Qujiang City. Reinforcements come swifter than yours.”

The Left Envoy rotated his golden bracelet—a famed magical artifact. “Foolishness. Our forces in Yingzhen outpace yours. The mountain’s true entrance lies there, not Qujiang’s Qin Manor.”

Xi Liu paled. “What trickery is this?”

“Two purposes: misdirect attention, and ensure discreet entry. While fools search elsewhere, we secure our prize.”

“Even so,” Xi Liu challenged, “how will you summon aid from this depth?”

“Preparations are made.” The Left Envoy’s smile chilled. “Your calculations falter, Xi Liu. The Demon Soul Sect’s reach extends beyond your comprehension.”

As tensions mounted, Guan Yu gripped Wang Xiaorong’s wrist, preventing her from exposing their position during accusations of betrayal. The Young Mistress seethed when blamed for the Left Envoy’s Echo Pavilion visit, but the envoy’s defense soothed her: “The Young Mistress plays no part in sect affairs. Our meeting was coincidence.”

“Enough!” Xi Liu declared. “Today we stake our lives here. The Eight-Sided Drum’s power will elevate whichever faction claims it. Why not join forces?”

“By what right?” The Left Envoy sneered. “What strength does your pathetic cave possess?”

“The strength of necessity.” Xi Liu’s eyes glinted. “Cloudgreen’s vanguard approaches. Fight us now, and you’ll lack strength to resist them.”

The Left Envoy’s bracelet gleamed ominously as calculations warred behind his eyes. Neither faction could afford weakness before the orthodox sects’ arrival—yet trust between demons proved fragile as morning frost.
