“Hmm, you’re right. My master must have encountered formidable enemies. Otherwise, he would never have abandoned me,” the voice replied.

Guan Yu found this plausible. Considering how long his master had been missing—judging by the other’s tone, perhaps thousands if not tens of thousands of years—even if the master still lived, his circumstances were likely dire.

“Senior,” Guan Yu asked, “since your contract with your former master remains, does that mean you cannot form a new bond with another?”

“Heh! You brat! You came here hoping to claim ownership, didn’t you? I knew your ‘friendly chat’ had ulterior motives!” The voice chuckled darkly.

“Not at all, Senior. You misunderstand,” Guan Yu assured. “I already possess two magical artifacts suited to me. I seek no more. I merely ask out of curiosity.”

“You’ve been isolated for ages because the Dragon Eye Amber lay hidden in an unknown place. Now that we’ve found it, rest assured—people will visit you periodically. You’ll no longer be lonely.”

Guan Yu added, “Moreover, after I leave, someone far more powerful may arrive soon to keep you company.”

He aimed to set expectations, avoiding a repeat of Wang Jun’s predicament. By implying free access, he hoped to secure future visits without obstruction.

“Where exactly was the Dragon Eye Amber found?” the voice inquired earnestly.

“In the forests of Miaocheng, a city in the demon realm. My friend discovered it in a bird’s nest,” Guan Yu explained. “He mistook it for an egg. Neither of us imagined it was a supreme immortal artifact.”

“Miaocheng…” The voice pondered. “That aligns. My master was a demonic cultivator. If it surfaced there, it fits. But what fate befell him after all these years?”

Guan Yu startled. The artifact’s former master being a demon explained its immense power.

“Senior, what was your master’s name or distinguishing traits? Perhaps I could search for clues,” Guan Yu offered.

“Futile. My master faced catastrophic peril—else he’d never abandon his artifact. Finding him now is impossible.”

Guan Yu agreed. Such a mighty figure, grievously wounded or in hiding, might already be clinging to life.

“This space is extraordinary. My artifact, the Imperial Seal, has limited dimensions, and its spirit can only manifest through energy. Yet here, the realm is boundless, and you exist tangibly. Astonishing!”

“How dare you equate immortal artifacts with mere magical tools? Fool!” the voice snapped.

“Of course. Immortal artifacts surpass magical ones entirely.”

“Nonsense! It’s not mere superiority—it’s a qualitative leap! A single immortal artifact outweighs countless magical ones!”

Guan Yu inwardly scoffed, *What pride! You’re still a trapped dog, forever confined.* But he dared not voice this, unsure if the spirit could read minds.

“You’ve potential, boy. Cultivate diligently,” the voice unexpectedly advised.

“Thank you, Senior.” Guan Yu sensed the spirit recognized his dual cultivation of magic and martial arts, yet remained unimpressed—a first in his experience. Such indifference hinted at the spirit’s—or its former master’s—extraordinary stature.

“What conditions must one meet to claim the Dragon Eye Amber?” Guan Yu pressed.

“None. My whim decides. But I await my master’s return. I’ll bond with no other… for now.”

“I pray you reunite someday. However, tomorrow, my friend and I plan to gift the Dragon Eye Amber to another.”

“What?! You’d give it away? Have donkeys kicked your brains?!” the spirit roared. “This is the purest white Dragon Eye Amber—a peerless immortal artifact! Even your fathers don’t deserve such a gift!”

*You’re just a spirit. What say do you have?* Guan Yu thought but held his tongue.

“It’s useless to us—a mere trinket since we can’t bond with it,” Guan Yu feigned sorrow.

“Is this a threat?!” the spirit retorted. “Immortal artifacts aren’t casually claimed!”

“Its fame invites danger. We lack power to protect it. Enemies would swarm us. Surrendering it removes that peril.”

The spirit grudgingly conceded. “True. Without strength, possessing it is lethal. But whom will you entrust it to?”

“My master, Xuan Ming—leader of the righteous Yunqing Sect. None now surpass him in single combat.”

“Unfamiliar. But if he’s formidable, I might consider him. Though I wonder—what caliber defines ‘strongest’ in this diminished era?”

“Current cultivators pale to predecessors. Lost techniques, selfish masters hoarding knowledge—the world’s prowess has decayed.”

“Logical. Yet geniuses may still emerge, surpassing ancestors. Otherwise, cultivation itself would’ve vanished.”

“We’ll gift you to Xuan Ming. Though he wields another immortal artifact—the Hidden Dragon Sword—he may visit you. With his millennia of experience, you’ll find conversation engaging.”

“Splendid! I’ll unseal the amber. Let visitors come! My master’s contract be damned!”

With terms settled, Guan Yu withdrew his consciousness.

Chapter 4709: Kicked by a Donkey

Exiting, Guan Yu found Wang Jun asleep by the bed. *He naps while I risk my soul?*

He plotted negotiating favors from Xuan Ming—perhaps exchanging the amber for potent artifacts. As sect leader, Xuan Ming’s greed wouldn’t override propriety.

Wang Jun, sleepless all night, agonized over relinquishing the treasure. Guan Yu understood—who wouldn’t cling to such power? But pragmatism demanded sacrifice.

Chapter 4710: Agitation

At dawn, a disciple summoned them to the main hall.

Inside, Xuan Ming paced frantically, a stark contrast to his usual composure. All sect elders had gathered.

“Wang Jun! Show me the immortal artifact!” Xuan Ming demanded.

Guan Yu interjected, “It’s with me now. Wang Jun gifted it. Thanks to Elder Zheng, we learned it’s the legendary Dragon Eye Amber.”

“Where is it?!”

“Why the hurry, Master? It’s mine, not yours.” Guan Yu feigned nonchalance. “We’ve met its spirit. Truly, immortal artifacts are beyond mortal mastery.”

“You see? I told you!” Elder Zheng exclaimed. “The white Dragon Eye Amber—exactly as the ancient texts describe!”

Initially skeptical, Xuan Ming now stared in awe. “You communed with its spirit? Only supreme artifacts house such entities!”
