“This Cloud Azure Sect’s medicinal pill, though touted for strengthening the body, is only compatible with our sect’s cultivation techniques. After Guan Yu swallowed it, the Eight-Drum Art—previously stabilized in his mind—suddenly surged to life, sensing danger as an external force sought to purge it.

The domineering Eight-Drum Art would never yield its territory. Enraged, it not only resisted the seal in Guan Yu’s mind but also clashed with the spiritual energy within his body, each force vying for dominance over his flesh.

Guan Yu was instantly overwhelmed by excruciating agony, surpassing even the torment he’d endured in Elder Menghua’s underground palace. He writhed on the floor, drenching his clothes in sweat until, unable to bear it, he collapsed into unconsciousness. Yet the battle within raged on—the energies of his spine still clashing violently. If this continued, his body would soon rupture and perish.

After dining with Xiao Zhi, Yan Zhao suggested, “Eldest Senior Brother, are there any interesting spots in this book town? Since we’ve time to spare, I’d like to explore.”

Yan Zhao inwardly calculated: by now, the pill’s effects should have taken hold. He’d deliberately given it to Guan Yu, knowing its true purpose. If Guan Yu harbored demonic cultivation arts, the pill would trigger a backlash rather than aid him.

“Indeed. Wander along Five Star Street. My recovery isn’t complete—I’ll rest at the inn and won’t join you,” Yan Zhao replied.

“Understood. Return and rest, Eldest Senior Brother. I’ll explore alone,” Xiao Zhi said before departing.

As Xiao Zhi strolled the streets, he noticed posted notices. Initially dismissing them as wanted posters, he froze upon spotting Yue Jing and Lai Lixia of the Red Lotus Sect—two villains he’d never forget—among the crowd.

“Lixia, look! Isn’t this Guan Yu from the Cloud Azure Sect?” Yue Jing sneered, pointing at the notice.

A townsman gasped, “A Cloud Azure disciple murdering innocents? How?”

The Cloud Azure Sect’s reputation as the foremost orthodox faction was renowned, even among commoners.

Yue Jing scoffed, “Even righteous sects harbor scum. Such vermin deserve capture.”

Xiao Zhi pushed forward, finding Guan Yu’s portrait under the heading “WANTED,” accused of murdering a Magistrate Zhou.

“Then you must know him?” another townsman asked.

“As Red Lotus disciples, we’ve crossed paths with Cloud Azure members. This one always seemed shady—who knew he’d turn killer?” Yue Jing slandered.

Biting back anger, Xiao Zhi stayed hidden. Confronting them alone was futile, and revealing his sect ties would spell disaster. Best to warn Guan Yu immediately.

As Xiao Zhi turned to leave, a voice shouted, “I’ve seen him! He stays at the Handsome Inn!”

**Chapter 3731: Heaven-Sent Opportunity**

Xiao Zhi paled—authorities would soon raid the inn. He sprinted back.

Yan Zhao, having returned first, found Guan Yu’s door ajar. Inside, Guan Yu lay unconscious on the floor. “Guan Yu? Bathroom again?” Yan Zhao feigned concern before smirking. “Heaven aids me! Killing you now would be effortless… but you’re still useful.”

Drawing Thousand-Year Peach Wood, Yan Zhao gloated, “Once I absorb your Eight-Drum Art, I’ll become invincible—and cure my Blood Toxin. Forgive my ruthlessness, Junior Brother.”

Red light emanated from the wood as Yan Zhao channeled spiritual energy toward Guan Yu’s dantian.

“Guan Yu! Disaster strikes!” Xiao Zhi’s voice echoed outside. Yan Zhao hastily ceased, hiding the wood.

Panting, Xiao Zhi burst in. “Authorities are coming! We must flee!”

Yan Zhao feigned relief. “He’s merely unconscious. What happened?”

“No time! Grab our things—we’ll escape via the rear!”

As they fled on horseback, Guan Yu awoke hours later in a moonlit forest, body aflame with conflicting energies. “Leave me!” he roared, bolting into darkness.

Xiao Zhi tackled him. “What’s wrong?!”

“Don’t… touch me!” Guan Yu thrashed, fearing exposure of the Eight-Drum Art.

**Chapter 3733: Pursue!**

Officer Han frowned at the innkeeper. “You claim ignorance, yet they fled through your back gate!”

A servant interjected, “They took horses! Our master can’t afford more losses!”

“We’ll ‘borrow’ these too!” Officer Han barked. “After them!”

Yue Jing and Lai Lixia watched, hoping for Guan Yu’s capture.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu meditated under moonlight, veins bulging. “I can’t control it!” he gasped before collapsing anew.

Xiao Zhi panicked. “Is he dying?”

Yan Zhao feigned concern. “Merely exhausted. Heaven favors him.”

As dawn broke, the exhausted authorities abandoned pursuit. In the forest, Yan Zhao plotted while Xiao Zhi kept vigil—unaware his trusted senior brother hungered for Guan Yu’s power.
