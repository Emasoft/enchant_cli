The others also looked up. The space here was approximately ten meters high, equivalent to a three-story building, with no windows whatsoever. Only a half-meter square ventilation opening existed near the top.

Chapter 3677: Four Dishes

Guanyu asked, "For a storage room, regardless of size, why build it so tall?"

A-Xiao remained silent while A-Wu replied, "I don't know. It was already like this when I arrived. The height matches the external third floor. Perhaps it was constructed this way for aesthetic purposes."

The windowless room felt dim, yet Guanyu could discern the heron-patterned walls appeared waxed – smooth and glossy. Wooden panels created moisture-resistant partitions, both sturdy and practical.

A-Wu suggested, "Let's leave. This place unsettles me. Three years ago... something horrifying happened here."

"Horrifying incident?" Wang Xiaorong immediately perked up. "What exactly occurred?"

A-Wu whispered cautiously, "Haven't you heard of the Tiangou (Heavenly Dog)? Three years ago—"

A-Xiao abruptly interrupted, "Senior Brother A-Wu! Have you forgotten Master's rules?"

"Y-you should explore elsewhere," A-Wu stammered, hastily retreating.

A-Xiao then guided Guanyu's group through all three floors. Upon reaching the third level, Guanyu understood why the waterfall sounded so deafening – the temple practically clung to the cascade's edge.

Standing on the third-floor corridor, one could nearly touch the plummeting water. The thunderous roar explained the noise. A small window behind them revealed the storage room's ventilation shaft. Guanyu found this puzzling – storage areas required dryness, yet this opening faced the waterfall's spray that risked dampness.

Wang Xiaorong shouted over the roar, "Guanyu! If the waterfall ever widened, wouldn't it wash the temple away?"

"Unlikely," Guanyu replied. "This temple has stood here for ages."

A-Xiao urged, "Few visit this noisy area. Let's descend. Dinner should be ready."

Returning to the first floor, they found Old Qiu waiting. Contrary to expectations of monastic austerity, each place setting boasted four dishes – two meat, one vegetable, and soup – rivaling five-star hotel presentations.

Guanyu marveled at the spread, complimenting Chef A-Huo: "Master A-Huo, I never imagined such culinary skill!"

Old Qiu chuckled, "My temple, my rules. When distinguished guests visit..." He raised his cup. "Let us dine!"

During the meal, Wang Xiaorong suddenly inquired, "Master Qiu, what of the Tiangou legend?"

The old man's jovial expression twisted into a grotesque mask of rage. "Who spoke of this?!"

A-Xiao trembled, "This disciple... merely mentioned it in passing."

"Fools!" Old Qiu smashed his rice bowl. "Never speak of this again! Not one word!" The enraged master stormed out, ruining the festive atmosphere.

Later that night, screams pierced the darkness. Guanyu found Yue Gao trembling outside. "Just... a nightmare," the detective panted.

A-Wu arrived pale-faced. "Did... did you dream of Tiangou?" Without waiting for reply, he fled in terror.

Chapter 3678: Restless Night

Guanyu scoffed at their superstitions. "Tiangou devouring flesh without touching bones? Preposterous! Humans surpass any beast in cruelty."

At dawn, sleep-deprived disciples gathered for breakfast. A-Huo yawned over steaming congee: "Master meditated all night." A-Xiao drowsily admitted copying scriptures till dawn.

Noticing Old Qiu's absence, Wang Xiaorong commented, "Your master sleeps late?"

"Unusual," A-Huo frowned. "Master never misses meals."

A bloodcurdling scream shattered the morning calm. They found A-Wu catatonic outside the storage room, staring upward. There, suspended from the ten-meter rafters, swung Old Qiu's lifeless body.

Chapter 3679: No Escape

Yue Gao organized rescue efforts. "We need ropes!" The ventilation shaft provided access to crossbeams slick with dust. As Yue Gao inched across the precarious beam, Wang Xiaorong whispered, "Guanyu... how did he reach those rafters without ladders?"

Below, A-Huo trembled while catching the descending corpse. The ventilation opening's proximity to the beam solved the logistical puzzle – yet deepened the mystery. Why would the temple master choose this theatrical suicide? And why did his final moments etch such primal terror across A-Wu's face?

The answer, perhaps, lay in the disciples' whispered warnings and the shadowed corners where waterfall spray blended with something darker – something that howled at the moon and left only clean-picked bones.
