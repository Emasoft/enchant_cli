As Xue Mo (Blood Demon) raised the Bloodthunder Bomb toward the ice platform, Guan Yu's heart clenched in urgency. Tilting his head to avoid vital points, his radiant spiritual energy sword blazed with fiery aura as he thrust straight at Mo Ya (Devil Tooth)'s chest.

Mo Ya never anticipated Guan Yu would trade blows so recklessly. By demonic logic, self-preservation should reign supreme when both master and kin faced peril. How could this human risk injury for Xue Jing's corpse?

With a sickening squelch, Mo Ya's claws sank into Guan Yu's shoulder. A pained grunt escaped Guan Yu's lips even as his flaming sword pierced Mo Ya's chest, drawing an agonized roar from the demon.

Activating the copper coin's gravity system, Guan Yu teleported before Xue Mo—only to see the Bloodthunder Bomb already hurled toward its target.

Xue Jing's heart wrenched seeing Guan Yu endure wounds to protect her frozen form. "Husband, don't sacrifice yourself for me!" she transmitted urgently through spiritual sense.

Guan Yu's gaze found her faintly materializing silhouette in the air as he replied, "I failed to shield you from the spiritual frost before. How could I let them harm you again? Focus on reconstituting your body—once complete, you'll help me slaughter these demons!"

Even as he spoke, Guan Yu bit his tongue hard, pushing beyond his limits. Another massive energy sword materialized in his grip. Seizing Xue Mo's chest with his left hand, his right swung the blade toward the demon's neck.

The Bloodthunder Bomb represented Xue Mo's ultimate technique. Having conjured two already at Mo Ya's command, the demon now lacked even the strength to shapeshift. "Master, save me!" Xue Mo shrieked as Guan Yu's sword fell.

Too late. The blade cleaved through demonic flesh with a crunch, Xue Mo's head tumbling free before dissolving into black mist captured in Guan Yu's fist.

A thunderous explosion rocked the cavern. The shockwave hurled Guan Yu thirty feet backward, boots carving ice as he struggled to stabilize.

Whirling around, Guan Yu's blood ran cold. The Bloodthunder Bomb's impact revealed a translucent barrier around the ice platform—the original frost pillar's protective formation. Cracks now spiderwebbed across its surface from previous assaults.

Within the failing barrier, Xue Jing's body had materialized up to her chest while her aerial spirit form gained clarity. "A spiritual avatar?!" Mo Ya bellowed incredulously. "What primordial power lies in this cavern to produce such pure energy?!"

Guan Yu realized these demons had stumbled upon the Arctic Primordial Vault by accident. Spiritual avatars required energy of peerless purity—a legend even Mo Ya had only heard in whispers. The demon's eyes glowed with avarice.

To Mo Ya, Guan Yu posed no real threat—especially after their earlier exchange. With the barrier cracking, consuming that pristine spiritual body seemed inevitable.

Huan Mo (Illusion Demon) trembled nearby, having witnessed Xue Mo's instant annihilation. Any thought of ambushing Guan Yu died as the human absorbed Xue Mo's essence into his dantian. Guan Yu's energy reserves surged, color returning to his face.

Mo Ya watched indifferently as Guan Yu absorbed his subordinate. Sacrificing underlings meant nothing compared to claiming that spiritual trove. Demonic alliances held no loyalty—only mutual exploitation.

Black energy coalesced around Mo Ya's claws as he prepared to shatter the barrier. Guan Yu's flaming sword already descended toward the demon's back.

"Huan Mo! Intercept him!" Mo Ya barked without turning.

The Illusion Demon hesitated, eyes darting. With a contemptuous snort, Mo Ya's claw shot backward, ensnaring Huan Mo in chains of dark energy. "Did you think me blind to your scheming, you treacherous wretch?"

Before Huan Mo could beg, Mo Ya's jaws unhinged, sucking the struggling demon inward like gelatin. Gulping loudly, Mo Ya grinned at Guan Yu. "Persistent pest. Let me reunite you with your woman—in my belly!"

The demon's body swelled monstrously—thirty feet tall with hands like temple gates. "Know why I'm called Devil Tooth?" he sneered, jaws distending to reveal blackened fangs.

Though replenished by Xue Mo's essence, Guan Yu remained outmatched. Yet he stood firm before the barrier where Xue Jing's form now half-materialized. Ducking beneath a crushing palm strike, Guan Yu's blade scored Mo Ya's back, drawing another roar.

Seizing the opening, Qiong Si mustered his last strength. A pillar of fire erupted beneath Mo Ya's groin. The stench of charred flesh filled the air as the demon howled. "Vermin! Taste your own medicine!"

A black spear materialized in Mo Ya's grip, hurled toward Qiong Si. Guan Yu intercepted with crossed palms, the impact blasting both humans backward. Qiong Si collapsed, bones shattered. "Master... flee..." he whispered before going limp.

Guan Yu's vision blurred. They'd known each other mere hours, yet this disciple had fought unflinchingly to the end. "If death comes," Guan Yu vowed silently, "I'll meet it facing forward."

Mo Ya's gargantuan foot descended with mountain-crushing force. Guan Yu raised trembling arms to meet it. Blood geysered from his nostrils upon impact, cracking the ice beneath into a crater that swallowed him to the waist.

"Comfortable?" Mo Ya taunted, inhaling the metallic scent with relish.

Guan Yu licked blood from his lips. "Your legendary demonic strength feels like a massage! Try harder, flea-bitten mutt!"

Above, Xue Jing's tear froze mid-fall. Guan Yu's voice suddenly whispered in her mind: "Fear not, little wife. Once your form solidifies, we'll carve up this cur together!"

Her heart broke seeing fresh blood spray as Guan Yu sank deeper. Through their bond, she sensed her five polar bears waiting above. At her mental command, the massive creatures crashed through the ceiling, paws slamming Mo Ya's back.

"Traitorous beasts!" Mo Ya bellowed, though the blows barely registered. "After I crush this insect, you'll make fine rugs!"

Guan Yu's arms creaked ominously. Through the pain, he grinned savagely—time for one final gamble.

Mo Ya's mocking laughter echoed. "Foolish human! Did you think I wouldn't counter your teleportation tricks?" The demon's innate ability—Demonic Cage Restraint—held Guan Yu immobile. "Now DIE!"

Xue Jing strained against invisible bonds, her half-formed body useless. Qiong Si lay motionless, breaths shallow. Guan Yu met the descending foot with upturned palms, blood erupting from every pore as ice shattered beneath him.

"Let's see... whose will... breaks first..." Guan Yu ground out through clenched teeth. The cavern trembled as primordial energies stirred deep below—the Arctic Primordial's slumber disturbed at last.
