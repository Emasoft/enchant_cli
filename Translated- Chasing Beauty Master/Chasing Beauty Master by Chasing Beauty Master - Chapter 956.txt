Pan Taisheng handed the backup USB drive to Mimi and left with his subordinates.

Guan Yu had sought Pan's help precisely because the seasoned underworld figure excelled at such covert operations. Cautious by nature, Pan and his men had worn helmets throughout their mission in the heavily surveilled villa area, leaving no identifiable traces.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's group had long departed Forest Grand Hotel. At Lin Qiaoqiao's insistence—though no one understood why she'd gotten so wild after drinking—they were now reveling in Hua Ye Club's largest VIP room. Club owner Hou Jinshun had specially vacated the space for them.

After completing his task, Pan Taisheng arrived at the club and handed Guan Yu a freshly recorded USB. "This will keep Wan Badan terrified of you for life," Pan chuckled. "Footage of their...enthusiastic group activities. You understand."

"Perfect. This leverage will keep him in check." Guan Yu smiled, though Pan declined to stay for festivities.

Seeing little personal use for the incriminating footage, Guan Yu sealed the USB in an envelope and tucked it into Lin Qiaoqiao's purse. "Let her make proper use of this," he mused.

As the night wore on, Amei and Sakura grew exhausted while Lin Qiaoqiao reached near-unconscious drunkenness. When Xue Jing struggled to support the stumbling Lin, the latter slurred, "Guan Yu! Come hold me! Jing's too petite—she can't manage!"

No one could tell if this was genuine inebriation or act. "Let her stay at Qiaoyuan District tonight," Xue Jing suggested, herself tipsy. "She can use my room."

Though multiple guest rooms stood empty at the villa, the late hour made preparation impractical. Despite Xue Jing's notorious cleanliness standards, they settled on her offering Lin her bed.

After helping Lin into Xue Jing's room, Guan Yu murmured approvingly, "Nice texture," only to be shoved out by an indignant Xue. "You pervert! Get back to your own room!"

Later, Xue Jing quietly slipped into Guan Yu's bedroom, leaping onto the mattress with a bounce. The alcohol-fueled night passed uneventfully...

"AAAAH!" A bloodcurdling scream erupted from Xue Jing's room at 6 AM, rousing the entire household. Zhang Han simply rolled over while Lü Mei grumbled into her pillow, but others came fully alert.

**Chapter 2445: A World of Difference**

Rubbing her temples, Xue Jing stumbled from Guan Yu's room toward the source of commotion. She found Lin Qiaoqiao huddled on the floor clutching a blanket. "Where am I? Where are my clothes?!"

"Calm down! You got too drunk last night. Guan Yu brought you here."

"But my..."

"I undressed you! Your reeking clothes are being washed." Xue Jing tossed Lin a clean outfit. "This is new—keep it." (Unspoken was her plan to replace all bedding and discard anything Lin had touched.)

**Chapter 2446: Overnight Infamy**

As Amei and Xue Jing prepared breakfast, Lin fiddled with her phone in the living room. Emerging from the bathroom, Guan Yu startled her into dropping the device—revealing the USB plugged into it.

"You PERVERT!" Lin shielded her eyes, kicking wildly. "Why's this disgusting thing in my bag?!"

"That's insurance against Wan Badan," Guan Yu explained. "I didn't expect you to..."

Xue Jing inspected the fallen phone, its screen now cracked. "You owe her a new phone," she scolded Guan Yu. "Preferably one that can't play USBs!"

As Lin chased Guan Yu through the villa with a cushion, cyberspace exploded. Pan Taisheng's uploaded video—titled *Exposé: Deputy Director Wan's Orgiastic Lifestyle*—went viral overnight through social media shares. By dawn, Wan Badan's face (and other body parts) dominated every newsfeed.

**Chapter 2447: Weathering the Storm**

At police headquarters, Wan Badan faced his livid superior Director Zhang Dongyi. Computer screens displayed uncensored footage of his "activities."

"Explain this disgrace!" Zhang roared.

"I...I was framed! That USB last night..." Wan stammered.

"Framed?!" Zhang slammed the desk. "The whole nation saw you live! The disciplinary committee's already been notified."

As colleagues snickered outside, Wan's career crumbled faster than the pixels documenting his downfall. Director Zhang coldly concluded, "Resign quietly. Maybe return after the scandal dies down...in a decade or two."
