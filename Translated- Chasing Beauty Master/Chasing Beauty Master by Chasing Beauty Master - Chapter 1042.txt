“Guan Yu had meticulously calculated this figure before demanding it. Although Young Master Feng would feel heartache over parting with fifty million, he’d gladly pay that sum for peace of mind.

Returning to his room, Young Master Feng gathered all his bank cards. After tallying the amounts, the three cards combined held less than twenty million—not even half the required sum. He muttered bitterly, “What the hell should I do now? Do I really have to dip into the company’s funds?”

These funds were his usual pocket money, scattered across various banks. Rarely did he spend much, except when replenishing the household’s female companions—though most were gifts from sycophants.

A headache throbbed at his temples as he recalled Bill Lin’s idiotic blunders. Even if he emptied all his personal funds, it still wouldn’t suffice for Guan Yu.

His reserves had dwindled after Guan Yu extorted twenty million at Houyuan Temple. Add tonight’s expenses for hiring cultivators, and what remained fell short.

“No choice—I’ll have to borrow from the company,” he resolved. Summoning the accounting director, he acknowledged that despite wielding the Feng family’s authority, corporate funds required formal approval.

Stepping into the courtyard, he winced at the sight of bloodied casualties strewn about. Intending to stall Guan Yu at the gate, his gaze drifted to the unlit West Tower, reminding him of Feng Xihu (West Lake).

The West Tower’s lights had long dimmed. Aside from the cleaning aunt, no one dared enter since Feng Xihu’s departure. She hadn’t contacted the family since leaving, save for sending a token gift on the patriarch’s birthday. Rumors suggested she lived comfortably abroad.

Then he remembered: on her farewell birthday, the patriarch had gifted her a bank card with exactly fifty million. If she hadn’t taken it, it might still lie hidden in her room.

**Chapter 2664: Relief**

Barging into the West Tower, he flung open Feng Xihu’s door. A faint floral scent lingered in the sparsely furnished room. Ransacking wardrobes, handbags, and vanities yielded nothing until he slumped, sweat-drenched, onto the floor—she must have taken the card.

As his phone rang—the accounting director’s call—he spotted a small clutch by the computer. Inside lay a trove of cards: memberships, VIPs, and bank cards.

“So here they are!” He dialed the patriarch to identify the correct card and its password. Powering up her computer, he bristled at the desktop wallpaper—Guan Yu’s face—and furiously deleted all photos.

Confirming the card’s fifty million balance, he scribbled the password on its back and exhaled in relief.

Hurrying to the South Tower’s window, he found Guan Yu lounging on a car roof flanked by two beauties. “Guan Yu! Here’s the card with fifty million. The password’s on the back. Take it and leave!”

He tossed the card. Guan Yu hopped down, but Jones darted past him, snatching it mid-air.

“Thanks,” Guan Yu smirked. “If this holds fifty million, tonight’s feud is settled—but our older accounts remain.” Turning to Jones, he ordered, “Verify the amount and transfer the funds. Use it to cover the men’s medical bills.”

As the entourage dispersed, Young Master Feng finally breathed easy—the jinx was gone.

Returning home, Guan Yu found the women unworried; Xue Jing had already reassured them. Ami bustled to cook, his stomach growling in anticipation.

**Chapter 2665: Smooth Sailing**

At dawn, Guan Yu dispatched crews to scrub the blood-soaked streets of Qiaoyuan District, hiring a fleet of water trucks to cleanse the grime.

He then visited Yang Family’s private clinic. Outside Shuangshuang’s room, her complaints echoed: “Why hasn’t Big Brother come? I won’t heal without him!”

Her aunt chided gently, “He’s busy. Focus on resting.”

“But I’m here,” Guan Yu announced, entering with Xue Jing, who carried a thermos of bone broth.

Shuangshuang brightened. “Big Brother! You’ve cured half my illness already!”

“Rest well,” Guan Yu urged. “Your recovery is what matters.”

Her aunt demurred, “You needn’t visit so often. We’re well cared for.”

“Nonsense. My lifesaver deserves no less,” he replied.

As Shuangshuang praised the soup, Xue Jing beamed. “Drink up. It’ll strengthen you.”

After visiting Shuangshuang, Guan Yu headed to Central Hospital, where Jones met him.

“The card had fifty million,” she said, offering it back.

“Keep it. Allocate a thousand to me for my men. Distribute the rest to your injured—thirty wounded, nine critical, three dead.”

“Compensate the families generously,” Guan Yu stated coldly. “Bill Lin will answer for this.”

Wei Hongwei arrived, dark circles under his eyes. “Boss, five brothers got arrested torching Ge Yinglai’s turf. We need to bail them out.”

Guan Yu nodded. “I’ll contact Yang Congshan. What of Jia Bo?”

“Took a slash to the back. Resting now.”

“Take ten million from Jones. Ensure every injured brother gets premium care and compensation.”

**Chapter 2666: Reckless Hands**

In Jia Bo’s room, Xie Yulu fed him, blushing as the men joked about his “recovery activities.”

“Twenty stitches!” she huffed, fleeing their teasing.

Guan Yu surveyed Jia Bo’s casted arm. “Bravery’s good, but be careful. We lost sixty men—three dead. Cultivators fared better, but it was a costly victory.”

Jia Bo grinned. “Just a scratch. Assign me anything—I’m ready.”

Guan Yu outlined plans to absorb Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu’s territories, expanding the Yu Gang’s influence.

Wei Hongwei grimaced. “I’m too clumsy for this. Needs Jia Bo’s steady hand.”

“Rest first,” Guan Yu told Jia Bo. “But when healed, you’ll lead the takeover.”

As they strategized, the weight of leadership pressed on—a balance of loyalty, loss, and the relentless climb to power.
