“Guan Yu, what’s wrong with you?” Wang Xiaorong asked, noticing his distracted expression.

“Oh, nothing. Just reminiscing about the past.”

“Oh, I want to hear about it! Tell me your story now—I’m dying to know!” she coaxed, clinging to his arm.

“There’s nothing worth telling. Besides, now isn’t the time for stories.”

“No! I insist! You *have* to tell me!” She swung his arm back and forth, pouting. “Pretty please? If you don’t, I’ll sit right here and never move!”

Guan Yu glared, tempted to dump his water flask over her head. Yet faced with her pleading eyes, he relented. “This isn’t the moment. Everyone’s waiting for us to deliver food. I’ll tell you another time, alright?”

“No! I want to hear it *now*! It’s so peaceful here—just the two of us. No one will disturb us!”

“If you keep disobeying, leave. I don’t tolerate childishness,” he snapped, shaking her off.

Wang Xiaorong’s tears spilled instantly. “You’re horrible! Always bullying me!” she sobbed, wiping her face. “I’ll never speak to you again!”

Though determined to ignore her, Guan Yu froze at her heartbroken cries, his feet anchored as if weighed by boulders.

“Fine—you win.” He sighed, returning to wipe her tears. “You know tensions are high. I can’t focus on stories now. I’ll tell you everything another night, I promise.”

**Chapter 3524: Stewed Chicken Soup**

“Let’s hurry and find food. My stomach’s revolting!” Wang Xiaorong conceded, regretting her earlier stubbornness.

Guan Yu couldn’t betray his sect, Yunqingmen, even if part of her wished it. Such treachery would shatter the heroic image she cherished. Their paths—orthodoxy versus demonic cult—made unity nearly impossible.

Yet Wang Xiaorong, ever mercurial, now skipped cheerfully beside him, her earlier despair forgotten. “Let’s check Qin Tai Jin’s room first. Madam Qin needs comfort after today’s chaos,” Guan Yu suggested.

“No! He’ll recognize me!” She clung to him, refusing to budge.

“You know him? Does he know you’re from the demonic sect?”

“He… might remember my face… from when I beat him,” she mumbled sheepishly.

Guan Yu shook his head, finally understanding Qin Tai Jin’s injuries. “To the kitchen, then.”

The once-bustling Qin Manor now lay eerily quiet, its halls nearly deserted as guards converged near Qin’s chambers. The kitchen, however, remained well-stocked. A simmering pot caught their attention, its fragrant steam curling into the air.

“Someone was here recently,” Guan Yu noted, eyeing the freshly stoked fire.

Wang Xiaorong sniffed eagerly. “Whatever’s cooking smells divine! Let’s take it!”

“We can’t steal their soup. It’s probably medicinal broth for Qin Tai Jin.”

“But it’s *right here*!” She lifted the lid, revealing golden chicken broth. “Look how rich it is! They won’t miss it!”

Before Guan Yu could protest, a rotund chef appeared, startling them. “Thieves?!”

“We’re guests!” Guan Yu explained hastily. “Just…hungry.”

Recognition dawned on the chef. “Ah, Master Guan Yu! Take whatever you need! These dishes were for Madam Qin, but she’s lost her appetite.”

Wang Xiaorong seized the chance. “What about this soup?”

“For Young Master Qin. Take it all—he’s already had his share.”

Grateful, they packed the aromatic broth into bamboo containers. Wang Xiaorong nearly drooled over the herb-infused elixir, a testament to the Qin chefs’ skill.

**Chapter 3525: Eat Your Fill**

Back in their quarters, the group devoured the feast. Wang Xiaorong monopolized the soup, draining bowl after bowl until drowsiness overtook her.

“Sleep here, and Guan Yu might vanish!” she fretted, fighting heavy eyelids.

Xiao Zhi and Aze slumped at the table. “Let us rest! We’re dead on our feet!”

“Up!” Guan Yu commanded. “We’re entering Duobao Mountain *now*. If we wait till dawn, Demonic Soul Sect will claim every treasure.”

Groaning, they shouldered bags of supplies—water skins, ropes, and mysterious tools.

“What’s in here? Boulders?!” Xiao Zhi grunted under the weight.

“Freshwater. We don’t know how long we’ll be trapped in there.”

Wang Xiaorong brandished an embroidered water pouch. “Mine’s empty! Fill it, Guan Yu!”

**Chapter 3526: The Marvelous Treasure (Part 1)**

“Move out! The cold air’ll wake you!” Guan Yu urged, leading them into the night. Duobao Mountain’s secrets awaited—and with rival sects already ahead, every moment counted.
