“Did you not hear yet?” The man glanced at Guan Yu before continuing, “This matter has spread far and wide. The Ao Tian Manor (Proud Heaven Estate) was completely massacred overnight – not a single soul remained. Even the guests staying there were killed. None escaped.”

Chapter 4058: Understanding

“How dreadful! What a tragedy. It seems our previous business with Ao Tian Manor must cease. What could have caused such slaughter? And what faction would commit such an atrocity?” Guan Yu feigned ignorance.

“Exactly!” Another white-haired man chimed in, “I'd just finalized a deal with Ao Tian Manor. Now I'm left with unsold fabric stock. Who could have foreseen this?”

“I heard it was the Imperial Guards’ doing,” interjected a well-informed fellow. “They claimed a fugitive had hidden in Ao Tian Manor. First they set fires inside, then slaughtered everyone present – left none alive.”

“How utterly barbaric!” Guan Yu lamented with affected sorrow. “Though the Imperial Guards wield immense power, they shouldn't massacre innocents! All those lives in Ao Tian Manor... This matter can't end here.”

“Who knows?” someone countered. “The Imperial Guards’ backing is unimaginably powerful. Still, this brutality exceeds all bounds.”

“Precisely! Even the mighty Imperial Guards have no right to treat human lives as weeds. This is unconscionable!”

“These killers show less mercy than bandits,” another voice added.

As the crowd buzzed with commentary, Guan Yu turned away, shaking his head resignedly. He whispered to Prince Zou, “Your Highness, Ao Tian Manor met this fate because of our disturbance. If possible, I hope you might aid the victims’ families.”

Prince Zou nodded gravely. “Indeed, this is our duty. We must investigate thoroughly. All identified families shall receive condolences and ample silver.”

Though initially disinclined, the prince couldn't refuse before Guan Yu without losing face. Hearing public condemnation of the Imperial Guards eased his mind – such widespread outrage might prompt imperial intervention.

While the Imperial Guards’ tarnished reputation pleased him, Prince Zou remained acutely aware that multiple factions sought his life, not just the Guards.

“Your Highness,” Guan Yu proposed, “I may need to depart for several days. If agreeable, I'll return in two days with reinforcements. Please remain here awaiting my return. Traveling together afterward would be safer.”

Prince Zou hesitated. Unfamiliar with Haer City and its governor – hence their lodging choice – prolonged stay risked complications. Yet with only four guards remaining if Guan Yu left, the journey's danger multiplied.

Wang Jun interjected, “I see little cause for worry. Given the Ao Tian Manor incident, the Imperial Guards likely won't act immediately. In this large city, hiring mercenaries could suffice temporarily. Gold motivates such men.”

Finding wisdom in this, Prince Zou acquiesced – trapped between retreat and uncertain progress toward the capital. “Lao Cang, my situation already precarious. Your absence increases danger. Could Wu Xiao or Wu Hui handle your errand?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “My task requires contacting friends through unique methods others cannot replicate. Remain at this inn – I'll return with aid in two days. Meanwhile, send men to recruit desperate mercenaries. Those valuing gold over life best ensure your protection.”

Reluctantly, Prince Zou agreed. “Very well. Wu Hui – investigate Ao Tian Manor's situation and comfort victims’ families. Wu Xiao – recruit martial artists with silver. No delays or drinking!”

Keeping both captains for protection, the prince appeared visibly anxious. Noticing this, Guan Yu offered, “I'll leave my son as your guard. His capabilities surpass ordinary men – he'll guarantee your safety.”

Xiao Zhi protested, “I want to go!”

“This is an order,” Guan Yu snapped. “You've played enough. Remember the maiden awaiting you at Minister Mao's residence.” Privately, he sought to avoid the youth's interference during his mission to contact Wang Xiaorong.

Prince Zou brightened. “Excellent! My life rests in your hands, lad. Lao Cang, why not leave your daughter too?”

Maintaining their disguises – Xiao Zhi as “Eldest Son”, Wang Jun as “Second Daughter” – Guan Yu declined. “Second Daughter serves me better. Rest assured, Eldest Son alone can protect you.”

After final arrangements, Guan Yu selected jewelry for Wang Xiaorong while Xiao Zhi greedily pocketed extras. “For Du Bingyan!” the youth claimed, though Guan Yu resolved to retrieve excess later.

Distributing remaining jewels to Ao Tian Manor's victims, the group dispersed. As Guan Yu and Wang Jun departed, she asked, “Who are you contacting?”

“The Mohist Sect. We need Wang Xiaorong.” Guan Yu strode confidently through crowded streets where their disguises drew no attention.

“I knew it!” Wang Jun chuckled. “You've few friends beyond the Mohist Sect's young mistress.”

“You know me well,” Guan Yu smirked. “Let's find their gathering point. There must be one in Haer City.”

After hours fruitless searching, they entered a tavern. “Look!” Wang Jun pointed to a red wine jar bearing a white label with skull-and-butterfly wings – the Mohist Sect's symbol.

Chapter 4060: The Fragrance

“The Ghost Butterfly emblem,” Guan Yu recognized. “This pattern dates from Meng Hua Patriarch's era. Though the original artifact disappeared, the sect maintains it as their sigil.”

When a waiter approached, Wang Jun pricked her finger. “I serve the Left Envoy. Does my blood reveal anything?”

The waiter summoned their leader – a heavily powdered woman reeking of cloying perfume. Her white-painted face and blood-red lips created a ghastly visage.

“We need urgent contact with the Young Mistress,” Wang Jun stated, presenting a Mohist token. “This man is Guan Yu.”

The woman inspected them silently before leading them deeper into the tavern's shadows, her overwhelming fragrance lingering like a visible haze.
