Guan Yu also stood up and politely shook hands with the other man. Hou Jinshun added, “This is my good friend, Qi Zhi. From now on, we’re all friends. Come, sit down and have a drink with us.”

Qi Zhi chuckled warmly. “It’s truly an honor to befriend Master Guan Yu. If I’m not intruding, I’ll gladly join you for a drink.”

“Of course, no need for formalities. Please, take a seat,” Guan Yu replied courteously. Since the others were being polite, he naturally reciprocated. This Qi Zhi was Hou Jinshun’s friend, so he wasn’t an outsider. Sharing a drink seemed perfectly reasonable.

**Chapter 2840: Let’s Snatch a Bargain**

A server brought over a bottle of liquor and several glasses. Qi Zhi raised his cup and declared, “Today, I’m honored to meet Master Guan Yu. I’ll drink first to show my respect.” With that, he downed the entire cup in one gulp.

Guan Yu smiled. “Impressive capacity, Brother Qi. But there’s no need to call me ‘Master.’ You seem a few years older—just call me Guan Yu.”

“Then I’ll drop the formalities, Guan Yu. How did you and Jinshun become friends?” Qi Zhi asked eagerly.

Guan Yu shot Hou Jinshun a mock-stern glance. “Aren’t you being a bit rude here? Have you never mentioned me to your friends? You’re making me lose face!”

Hou Jinshun scratched the back of his head sheepishly. “I’ve told all my old friends about you—they know how formidable you are. But Qi Zhi and I only met two days ago. I haven’t had the chance to bring you up yet.”

“Ah, I see!” Guan Yu laughed heartily. “Brother Qi, take a good look at him! This is exactly how he shamelessly begged to become my disciple back in the day!”

The group erupted in laughter. Qi Zhi’s gaze then fell on Xue Jing sitting further inside. Though his eyes briefly lit up, he tactfully averted them and exclaimed with exaggerated surprise, “Good heavens! Who might this young lady be? To encounter such peerless beauty in this world—what a rare and astonishing delight!”

Hou Jinshun grinned. “Forgot to introduce you. This is Guan Yu’s woman, Xue Jing.”

Qi Zhi nodded politely toward Xue Jing, who returned the gesture with equal courtesy.

Guan Yu frowned. “Hou Jinshun, must you phrase it so crudely? She’s my girlfriend, not ‘my woman.’ That term sounds downright vulgar.”

Hou Jinshun shrugged dismissively, thinking to himself: *You keep a harem at home yet put on airs here. The hypocrisy!* Of course, he dared not voice this aloud.

Qi Zhi remarked, “Brother Guan, you’re truly blessed to have such a celestial beauty by your side. Enviable indeed!”

Guan Yu offered a noncommittal smile. There was something affected about Qi Zhi’s speech—a stilted, archaic quality that grated on the ears.

After casual banter, the conversation turned to the treasure map. Hou Jinshun proposed, “Qi Zhi, since Guan Yu isn’t interested in the map, why don’t we team up to acquire it? Once we get our hands on it, we could easily flip it for millions!”

“That does sound tempting,” Qi Zhi mused. “How about this—I’ll investigate the map’s current whereabouts. If the price is right, we’ll buy it from the pawnshop. Reselling it through proper channels should yield substantial profits.”

Guan Yu interjected, “Brother Qi’s plan has merit. We shouldn’t rush this. The pawnshop is already feeling pressure, which will only intensify. When they can no longer withstand it, they’ll have to sell. That’s when we strike—acquire it cheaply, then resell it through the Yang Family Auction House for maximum gain.”

Hou Jinshun slapped his thigh. “Brilliant! We’ll monitor the pawnshop closely these next few days, apply some pressure ourselves, and wait for them to crack. Then we swoop in and grab ourselves a bargain!”

“Excellent,” Qi Zhi agreed. “This partnership will succeed. We’ll split profits fifty-fifty. I’ve already learned the pawnshop’s location—Golden Prosperity Pawn in the northern district. I’ll keep close watch there.”

After further conversation, Guan Yu departed. On the way home, he asked Xue Jing, “What do you make of Qi Zhi?”

She shook her head. “Unreadable. Even after hours together, he remains opaque. His jianghu background shows in that antiquated speech—it’s off-putting.”

“Agreed,” Guan Yu nodded. “He’s clearly a cultivator, yet appears ordinary. His cultivation method must differ from others, creating that dissonance.”

“Though Hou Jinshun claims they only met recently, Qi Zhi doesn’t strike me as malicious. Hou’s judgment in friends should be sound, right?” Xue Jing ventured.

Guan Yu frowned. “I can’t quite place him either. I’ll have him investigated. As long as we keep our distance, it shouldn’t matter. He’s likely just another treasure hunter drawn by the map.”

This reasoning eased their concerns. Once background checks cleared Qi Zhi, further interaction might be possible. Guan Yu also intended to inquire about his unique cultivation method—a question withheld during their first meeting.

Xue Jing changed subjects. “Your treasure map scheme is unfolding. What next?”

Only she and Guan Yu knew about the planted map—even Jones remained unaware. “Let events develop naturally,” Guan Yu replied. “I want to see how many hidden players emerge. Credit goes to Auntie Qing for that convincing backstory.”

He had approached Auntie Qing for help, and she’d agreed without hesitation—even ready to die at his request. Though Guan Yu tried compensating her, she refused, citing her daughter Ling’er’s increased financial support. He emphasized strict confidentiality, including keeping Ling’er in the dark.

**Chapter 2841: Laying Plans**

The leak at the Night Blossom Club originated from Auntie Qing’s contacts. Guan Yu had simply entrusted her with placing an item conspicuously, without revealing its nature. She’d chosen Old Luo—a village eccentric obsessed with sudden wealth—burying the package in his vegetable patch.

Sure enough, Old Luo “stumbled” upon life-changing fortune the next day. Auntie Qing, aware of Guan Yu’s scheme, asked no questions and kept silent about her role. She felt no envy toward the sudden millionaire—wealth came and went as fate decreed.

“You’ve helped the Qings tremendously,” Xue Jing noted. “Auntie Qing’s trustworthiness and your clever narrative transformed a simple map into legend. That farmer’s windfall was a nice touch.”

“Fortune favors the lucky,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Auntie Qing didn’t know what she planted—it could’ve brought disaster. At least it created a millionaire. Not my money anyway.”

“But escalating developments worry me. What if the map’s trail goes cold?”

“How so?”

“If some collector buys and hoards it, the map loses its purpose. Your plan relies on it circulating to flush out enemies.”

Guan Yu considered. “Even hidden, its location would be known. The owner would face endless trouble—like Bill Lin’s situation.”

Bill Lin’s formidable resources deterred most challengers, yet he still traveled cautiously. Similarly, any map holder would attract greedy eyes. “As long as it exists, tensions remain,” Guan Yu concluded.

“But if it disappears into private hands, manipulating events becomes impossible. Isn’t your goal to expose hidden foes through the map’s movements?”

Guan Yu’s primary adversary, Bill Lin, had been uncharacteristically quiet since Yuan Shanding’s departure. Reconnaissance revealed him holed up in the Feng residence, while his associate Ma Tong gambled freely. Notably, the Poison Widow had vanished from the Feng estate.

“It’s too early for conclusions,” Guan Yu decided. “Qi Zhi investigates the pawnshop tomorrow. We’ll reassess then.”

That night, Guan Yu dispatched Ganbili to probe the Golden Prosperity Pawnshop’s owner.

**Chapter 2842: Waiting Game**

At dawn, Qi Zhi arrived at the northern district’s Golden Prosperity Pawnshop. This chaotic neighborhood housed Ma Tong’s casino—the pawnshop being its sole establishment of its kind. Qi Zhi puzzled why the rural farmer had chosen this particular shop.

Eager for progress, Qi Zhi arrived early only to find shutters down. As he waited in his Audi, Hou Jinshun’s BMW SUV pulled alongside. “You’re up early!” Hou called out. “No sleep after last night?”

“Old habits—I usually nap afternoons. You?”

“Same. Any movement?” The silver security gates remained sealed.

“Been here since seven. It’s nearly eight-thirty!”

“Maybe they’re scared into hiding? That map’s worth more than their annual revenue.”

“But I’m here to buy, not rob!” Qi Zhi complained.

A street sweeper approached. Hou inquired: “Sister, is this shop closed?”

“Was open yesterday,” she replied in thick dialect. “Pawnshops keep odd hours—opens late, closes early.”

Thanking her, they resumed waiting. At nine, a young man on an electric scooter arrived, unlocking the gates. “Finally!” Qi Zhi sighed in relief.

The attendant let them in. The spacious interior featured classical décor with replica antiques, though a vase under glass appeared genuine.

“We’re here to purchase a specific leather artifact for collection,” Qi Zhi stated.

The attendant shrugged. “The appraiser arrives by ten. Wait if you like.”

As they settled onto wooden benches, Qi Zhi surveyed the shop. Outside the protective casing, most items seemed worthless—except that vase. Time crawled toward their fateful meeting.
