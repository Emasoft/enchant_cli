“That’s right. I remember Father mentioning that Senior Brother Chen Hong’s rapid cultivation progress stems from winning the previous Six Peaks Assembly championship. He received a transmission of power from the Merit Cauldron, which propelled his advancement,” Xiao Zhi explained.

“I also heard from Master that this year’s top four finalists will all receive transmissions from the Merit Cauldron, along with additional rewards,” he added.

Aze asked, “Receiving the Merit Cauldron’s power sounds like an incredible opportunity. We must seize it. Are there other prizes beyond that?”

“Certainly! Master said this year’s top four will receive focused mentorship. Not only will they gain the Merit Cauldron’s transmission, but each will also receive a magic artifact personally bestowed by Master. Given his standards, the quality should be exceptional.”

“What? Such generosity?” The two exchanged excited glances, recognizing this as a monumental chance.

Aze, in particular, had been lamenting his lack of proper tools, still relying on the Cloud Azure Sect’s basic Cloud Azure Sword—the lowest tier of magic artifacts.

Xiao Zhi encouraged him warmly, “Aze, you must break into the top four this time! With a high-grade artifact from Master Xuanming, you’ll soar. His selections never disappoint.”

Guanyu mused privately, *Artifacts? Xuanming has already handpicked his favorites. Whether Aze can even reach the finals is uncertain. Among the disciples, only Xuanming’s direct students show real promise—the rest are rabble.*

Xuanming had hinted that Guanyu and Siqi would secure two of the four slots, as both already possessed fine artifacts and required no further gifts. That left two openings. If Xiao Zhi claimed one, the last spot remained contested. Much depended on how Lin Chen and Ling Su—Xuanming’s other disciples—had progressed recently. Aze’s chances hinged on defeating them.

Aze sighed gloomily, “What four finalists? With you two cheating with your magic artifacts, how could I compete? And if Senior Brother Chen Hong joins, I’ll have no hope at all!”

Guanyu reassured him, “No need to worry. Master declared this Six Peaks Assembly is exclusively for newer disciples who’ve never participated before. The Cloud Azure Sect prioritizes nurturing the younger generation now.”

“Really?” Aze’s spirits lifted. “Then I might actually have a shot! Aside from you two, two slots remain. If they’re reserved for recent recruits, I could prevail. Imagine wielding a proper artifact!”

Xiao Zhi cheered, “I believe in you, Aze! Your diligence and innate talent—Father always praises your potential—will carry you through!”

“I’m certain Senior Brother Aze will reach the finals,” Guanyu chimed in. “When you do, I’ll help you pick an excellent artifact from Master’s collection.”

Aze grinned gratefully. After finishing their meal, he suddenly slapped his forehead. “Blast it! I forgot something important!”

“What? Did you skip wiping after your last bathroom trip?” Xiao Zhi teased.

“Nonsense! Remember the wine we buried here last time? Celebrating with Guanyu demands a drink!”

“Right!” Xiao Zhi clapped. “How could we forget? Let’s check if it’s still there!”

They rushed to a nearby tree. Xiao Zhi frowned. “We didn’t bring shovels. How do we dig?”

Guanyu approached. “You buried it here? Is it deep?”

“Not too deep. We stole this from Father’s stash last visit,” Xiao Zhi admitted with a sly chuckle.

“Simple then. Use daggers.” Guanyu produced a blade and began excavating. The prospect of wine paired with roasted meat promised a perfect evening.

Working together, they unearthed a small jar—at least five liters. Aze laughed, “Perfect! Meat, drink, and good company!”

Lacking cups, they passed the jar. Aze took the first swig and gasped, “Still fiery! Glorious!”

Guanyu gulped deeply and praised, “Superb brew!”

Xiao Zhi, a lightweight, warned, “Easy there! Father loves strong liquor, but I can’t handle much.”

“Don’t overdo it,” Aze joked. “If you get drunk, you’re sleeping here tonight.”

As dawn approached, Guanyu urged, “We should return before others notice.”

Aze agreed. “Next time, then. Guanyu, rebury the wine securely.”

“I’ll guard it well. Get Xiao Zhi back safely.”

Returning to his quarters, Guanyu reflected on the night’s insights into the Cloud Azure Sect’s workings. He slept through the day, waking at dusk to find the Six Peaks Assembly preparations in full swing.

Venturing out, he wandered through crowds until familiar voices called—Xiao Zhi and Aze waved energetically.

“Guanyu! Slept all day too, eh?” Xiao Zhi grinned. “Master Zheng’s wine nearly did me in!”

“Hush!” Xiao Zhi feigned secrecy. “Don’t mention that here!”

Guanyu nodded toward a dignified middle-aged man. “That must be Master Zheng. Impressive aura.”

“My father,” Xiao Zhi confirmed.

Approaching respectfully, Guanyu bowed. “Master Zheng, I’m Guanyu, a new disciple of Tiger Head Peak.”

“This is the Guanyu I mentioned,” Aze added.

Master Zheng appraised him. “The Sect Leader’s eye for talent never falters. To gift you the Imperial Seal… extraordinary.”

Xiao Zhi and Aze gaped. *The Imperial Seal—Xuanming’s prized artifact!* They exchanged meaningful glances, suspicions about Guanyu’s true lineage bubbling.

When Master Zheng requested to see the treasure, Guanyu obliged despite the public risk. The master marveled, “Such fortune! The Sect Leader must cherish you deeply to part with this.”

Later, the friends interrogated Guanyu. “Why would he give you the Imperial Seal? You’re no ordinary disciple!”

Guanyu deflected, “Perhaps you imagine more than exists.”

“Admit it!” Xiao Zhi pressed. “You’re the Sect Leader’s secret son! Why else such favor?”

Aze nodded vigorously. “No other explanation fits!”

Guanyu sighed. “Believe what you will. The Seal’s mine now—that’s all that matters.”

As whispers of his speculated heritage spread, Guanyu steeled himself for the coming trials. Tomorrow’s Assembly would test far more than cultivation alone.
