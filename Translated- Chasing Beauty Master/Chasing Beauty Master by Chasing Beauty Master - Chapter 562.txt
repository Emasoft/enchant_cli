At this moment, Guan Yu finally remembered Xiao Wei's situation. Night had already fallen, greatly hindering their search. The most terrifying things in the forest were magical beasts, which typically lurked by day and hunted at night. These unarmed youths made perfect prey.

“We must find Xiao Wei, but with darkness upon us, continuing the search now would endanger us all.”

“Boss, I say we return. Think—if we hadn't encountered Murong Yu earlier, what would our fate have been?”

After Pika Cat's reminder, Guan Yu nodded and addressed the group behind him, “Everyone, to ensure your safety, let's return tonight and resume the search tomorrow. Agreed?”

Silence hung heavy. Guan Yu read the solemn atmosphere in their eyes. Truthfully, he knew well—abandoning the search tonight meant waiting until dawn. Every passing minute diminished Xiao Wei's chances of survival.

As Guan Yu wrestled with indecision, Pika Cat suddenly leapt from his side. A mournful cry echoed from distant bushes.

Following the sound, the group saw a young man clad in black nightclothes emerge. Perched on his shoulder, Pika Cat glared coldly.

Guan Yu's brows arched in recognition.

**Chapter 1423: The Retrieval**

If memory served, this black-clad man was a retainer of the Murong Family. Murong Yu had already withdrawn with his men—why did this one remain?

“Explain yourself. A friendly warning: one false word, and your life ends here!”

The man trembled, having witnessed Guan Yu and Pika Cat's prowess—even a supreme expert like Chen Yaocheng had been defeated in three moves. His own meager skills stood no chance.

“Young Master Guan Yu! My eavesdropping meant no harm!”

“Hmph! No harm skulking in shadows?”

“After departing, our group discovered someone at Sheep Horn Mountain. My master suspected he might be your man but couldn't confirm. He sent me to inquire.”

Guan Yu's heart surged with hope. Pika Cat whispered, “Boss, credible?”

Normally distrustful, Guan Yu reconsidered—he'd spared Murong Yu today, who promised repayment. If Murong retained any conscience, this wasn't deception.

“Young Master Guan Yu, why hesitate now?”

“Exactly! Earlier you cited danger, yet now we know Xiao Wei's location. Why delay?”

“Perhaps he doesn't grasp our bond with Xiao Wei. He's an outsider. Let's go ourselves!”

Hearing these barbs, Guan Yu sighed. Ceasing deliberation, he declared, “Enough! We depart now!”

Leading thirty men toward Sheep Horn Mountain, they brought the black-clad guide as insurance. After two hours' trek, they arrived. Guided to a grassy mound, they found a youth lying beside a torch.

“Xiao Wei! That's him!”

Approaching, Da Peng shouted excitedly. Several rushed forward as Guan Yu examined Xiao Wei—blood smeared his lips and hands, but no other wounds. No werewolf attack.

However, shock and blood loss had left him frail. Unfound tonight, his fate by dawn would've been uncertain.

“Xiao Wei's found but weakened. Let's return him first. Other matters wait.”

Guan Yu turned to the black-clad man with a faint smile. “Tell Murong Yu this repays his debt. My thanks.”

The trembling man relaxed, bowing gratefully. “Understood! I'll report everything faithfully!”

With that, he vanished into darkness.

Four hours later, the group returned to Barren Town with unconscious Xiao Wei, heading straight to Bader's house instead of the inn.

They found Bader asleep with his wife. Annoyed by the commotion, he nearly leapt from bed when Pika Cat's glowing green eyes met his.

“Why... return so late?” Bader yawned blearily.

Guan Yu glared at his disheveled state. “You notice our lateness? We risked lives in the forest while you slept soundly. How?”

“Heh!” Bader scratched his head sheepishly. “I worried sick! But tomorrow's affairs demand energy. Health fuels revolution! Without strength, how fight werewolves?”

Guan Yu nearly gagged at the hypocrisy. Motioning toward Xiao Wei, he ordered, “Prepare a large room. I'll administer recovery pills. That adjacent space suffices.”

Producing Soul Revival Pills from his spatial ring, Guan Yu directed youths to carry Xiao Wei inside despite Bader's protests.

After ingestion, Xiao Wei's breathing steadied, pallor warming to healthy hue. Recovery seemed imminent.

Suddenly, wailing echoed outside: “My son! Where is he?”

Xiao Wei's aged mother soon hobbled in. Guan Yu cleared a path, guiding her to the bedside.

Seeing her motionless son, the old woman wept. “Young Master! What happened? Is he...?”

“Peace, grandmother. He merely slumbers. My pills will rouse him soon.”

The woman collapsed to her knees, kowtowing. “Our savior! How can I repay—”

Guan Yu sidestepped the gestures, urging others to lift her. “I keep promises. Combating evil is my duty. Credit goes to these brave souls too.”

He gestured to the rescue party. Unaccustomed to praise, the youths flushed with humble pride.

**Chapter 1424: Whispers**

A weak voice interrupted: “Mother... Where am I? Who's this?”

Xiao Wei blinked groggily. His mother rushed to caress his face. “Thank heavens you wake!”

“This gentleman saved your life,” she explained.

Xiao Wei struggled to rise in gratitude, but Guan Yu restrained him. “Thank your mother. Her vigil spared no sleep.”

“I... will honor her always. Thank you, Young Master.”

Pleased by his filial resolve, Guan Yu asked, “Recall what transpired today?”

Xiao Wei frowned. “Only... wolf-headed pursuers. I fell into Sheep Horn Mountain's pit... they stopped chasing.”

“Rest now. Stay here tonight. Our honorable Mayor Bader gladly aids his people—isn't that right?” Guan Yu's gaze pinned Bader.

“Of... of course! Stay till morning!”

Guan Yu arched a brow. “You misunderstand. They'll reside here permanently.”

“What?!” Bader's face twisted in protest.

Pika Cat yawned pointedly, fangs glinting. “Boss... Three days meatless. Famished...”

Catching the hint, Guan Yu grinned. “Where find meat this late? Raid Mayor Bader's pantry. Humans suffice.”

Bader paled. To a magical beast, devouring humans seemed natural—and he stood defenseless.

“Young Master! While I cherish our citizens... housing them here inconveniences all! Tomorrow I'll secure them fine lodgings nearby!”

Satisfied, Guan Yu nodded. “We depart then. Pika Cat—move out!”

Leaping from the window, they vanished.

Walking Barren Town's moonlit streets, Guan Yu contemplated the day's meaning—his first truly purposeful day in this new realm, discovering joy in aiding others.

“Boss, been out all day. Wonder if Amy's asleep?”

“Likely. Our stay here shortens. Today's incident but a prelude. If Wolf Poison Flower returned to War Wolf Mercenaries, tides may shift.”

“Can this war be averted?”

“Who knows? I pray so. Human-werewolf conflict would shatter families, claim innocents. Even War Wolf's men are war's victims—now playing aggressors.”

Reaching the inn, they noted light in second-floor windows. Silent as shadows, they leapt upward—child's play for mages.

Peering inside, they saw two figures.

“Sister Spring... Why isn't Dragon Brother back? Could danger...” Amy fretted.

“Don't fret! Master Guan Yu's blessed. That magical cat's formidable too! They'll return safe.”

“Hmm... Sister Spring, do you like Dragon Brother?”

Outside, Guan Yu nearly choked.

Blushing furiously, Liu Chuntian scolded, “Nonsense! Speak thus again and I'll sleep!”

Amy persisted obliviously. “Your blush betrays you! Shouldn't love be proclaimed?”

“Shameless girl! No wonder Master Guan Yu chides you!”

**Chapter 1425: Am I Ill?**

“Truthfully... I don't know. Not love... but being near him feels safe.”

“Boss! Your charm persists—another maiden captivated!” Pika Cat teased.

“Silence, or you're roasted!”

Entering abruptly, they startled the girls.

“Dragon Brother! We worried so!” Amy rushed forward.

“Merely hours abroad. Cease dramatics.”

“But Sister Spring worried too!”

Blushing, Liu Chuntian stammered, “We... feared dangers...”

“Minor troubles. Our success matters.”

“You must rest!” Chuntian urged.

Uncomfortable with her bashful concern, Guan Yu noted Amy's unusual quiet. Once, such attentions were her domain.
