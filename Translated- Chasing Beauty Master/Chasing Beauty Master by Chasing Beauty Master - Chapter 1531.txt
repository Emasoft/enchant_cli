After a short while, Old Fourth returned with a bundle in hand, saying, "Big Brother, I found this in the carriage. It contains some clothes."

The leader opened the bundle and discovered an exquisitely crafted envelope inside. Having studied literacy in his youth, he unfolded the letter and read it.

"Hahaha... Heaven truly favors us!" The leader burst into laughter, his face beaming with joy. "Today we've actually captured a prince! This is a major catch, brothers! We might strike it rich this time!"

Chapter 3970: Rescue Once More

The letter in the leader's hand was none other than the imperial summons for Prince Zou. It appeared the leader understood the document's significance, hence his triumphant laughter.

"Boss, what's happening? Is that envelope valuable?"

"It's not the envelope itself, but its contents!" The leader chortled, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. "Prince Zou here is the real treasure! All we need to do is inform certain interested parties of his whereabouts, and silver will flow into our hands like water!"

The prince glanced at his captors, realizing with dismay that these were no ordinary bandits. The old saying proved true - a thug isn't scary, but a thug with brains is terrifying. Their scheme was alarmingly well-conceived.

Should they deliver Prince Zou to factions supporting either the First or Second Imperial Prince, it would mean certain death for the royal captive and substantial rewards for the kidnappers.

After their jubilant celebration, the leader cautioned, "Lock them up securely. Don't let them escape. I'll contact our buyers - these prisoners should fetch an excellent price."

"Big Brother," one underling suggested, "While the prince is valuable, what about the woman..." His meaningful glance at the defiant yet attractive female captive needed no further explanation.

"Excellent idea!" The leader leered. "As your superior, I'll take first privileges. Then you may have your turns." He approached Zou Wuhui with predatory intent.

"Touch me and you'll regret it till your dying day," Zou Wuhui threatened weakly, her body sapped of strength.

"Still putting on airs?" The bandit mocked, closing in. "You won't cry until you see the coffin, eh?"

As the helpless princess struggled in vain, the door suddenly crashed open with a thunderous bang. Everyone jumped at the interruption.

"Who's there? More customers?" The leader barked, irritation marring his features. "You two - check outside!"

"No need for formalities," came a voice as Guan Yu, Wang Jun, and Xiao Zhi strode in. "We've already let ourselves in."

Originally planning to traverse the bamboo forest towards Lianzhou, the trio had reconsidered and backtracked after noticing suspicious activity around the prince's abandoned carriage. Their surveillance revealed bandits looting the vehicles and sealing the teahouse, prompting their intervention.

Spotting Guan Yu, Prince Zou cried out desperately, "Sir! Please help us!"

"Don't presume familiarity," Wang Jun retorted coldly. "We're merely passing through. Your affairs don't concern us."

Though capable of overpowering the bandits, the rescuers remained cautious. The prince's group clearly suffered from potent toxins, barely able to keep their eyes open.

Xiao Zhi added mockingly, "We came for tea, not trouble. Pretend we saw nothing." The trio turned to leave, baffling the bandits who had braced for combat.

The leader chuckled nervously, "False alarm! These meddlers know better than to interfere. Let's attend to our 'guests'."

Once outside, Guan Yu's group seated themselves conspicuously. "Landlord! Bring hot tea!" Guan Yu called loudly.

"Coming right up!" The false proprietor emerged with a teapot, all smiles. "Anything else, honored guests? We serve light meals too."

"No need," Guan Yu declined pointedly. "We'll drink and depart. Wouldn't want to risk... accidental poisoning."

The landlord stiffened momentarily before recovering. "You jest! Those inside tried dining without payment. We're merely detaining them for the magistrate."

"Not our concern," Guan Yu dismissed. "But tend to our horses first. They need fodder."

As the landlord retreated to conspire with accomplices, Guan Yu's group strategized. "They'll likely drug any food they bring," Wang Jun noted. "How to handle this?"

"Simple," Guan Yu shrugged. "Once refreshed, we subdue them. Just ensure the prince's safety."

"Then why wait?" Xiao Zhi pressed, fatigue evident from his sleepless night.

Their discussion halted as the landlord returned bearing dishes. "A complimentary offering, good sirs. Might we request assistance?"

Chapter 3971: A Favor Asked

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. "Assistance requires compensation."

"The magistrate needs notifying about these dine-and-dash scoundrels," the landlord fabricated. "Your horses will be fed while you... run this errand."

Wang Jun snorted, "After eating your poisoned food? We'd be in no state to go anywhere."

The bandit's smile faltered. "Poison? Preposterous! Merely humble fare."

"Prove it," Xiao Zhi challenged. "Eat some yourself."

The flustered landlord retreated, claiming to fetch replacement dishes. Guan Yu rose abruptly. "I'll check the horses."

Outside, Guan Yu caught two bandits attempting to steal their mounts. With swift strikes, he left the thieves battered. "Lesson learned," he remarked, dusting his hands.

Reentering, the rescuers discovered the prince missing - taken through a hidden exit during the commotion. Zou Wuhui pleaded, "Please! Chase them!"

"Why should we?" Wang Jun countered bitterly. "You spurned our previous help."

Zou Wuhui swallowed pride. "I beg you! Save His Highness, and you'll be richly rewarded!"

"Enough games," Guan Yu decided. "Wang Jun stays guard. Xiao Zhi and I pursue."

Chapter 3972: Deception Revealed

The rescuers split to search, employing mystical tracking arts. Back at the teahouse, Wang Jun revived the groggy guards using cold water. "Sleeping through your duty?" he chided.

Third Captain awoke in panic. "Where's His Highness?"

"Taken," Zou Wuhui said grimly. "We're powerless until the toxin wears off."

"But we checked the food!" Third Captain protested.

"The poison wasn't in the dishes," came the grim realization. "We've all been deceived."
