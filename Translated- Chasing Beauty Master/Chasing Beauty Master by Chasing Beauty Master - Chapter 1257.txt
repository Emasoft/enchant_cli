“I haven’t had rabbit meat in ages!” A Ze exclaimed cheerfully. “Last time was when Peak Master Lu treated us at Qianhui Peak. How fortunate to meet Junior Brother Guanyu today, bringing such a plump wild hare. This is wonderful!”

Zheng Xiaozhi took the hare, skillfully gutted it, discarded the entrails, and rinsed it with water from a nearby forest stream—their chosen spot for its clear waters perfect for cleaning game.

After preparing the hare, Zheng skewered it on a wooden spit and placed it beside the roasting pheasant. Guanyu remarked with a chuckle, “Senior Brother Xiaozhi handles this with such expertise. Your knife work and technique speak of frequent practice. A true connoisseur, I see!”

**Chapter 3231: Admiration**

“Hahaha! Naturally!” Zheng grinned. “Only Qianhui Peak in our Yunqing Sect offers decent fare. The other peaks are dismal. To eat well, one must either barter with Qianhui, or...” He gestured meaningfully at their surroundings.

A Ze snorted. “You’re never satisfied! Your father, Elder Zheng, constantly exchanges favors with Peak Master Lu to bring you delicacies. Meanwhile, folks like us go weeks without proper meals!”

“Can you blame me for craving more?” Zheng retorted. “Why else would I drag you here?”

Guanyu’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. The shared surname and Elder Zheng’s unusual solicitude—could Xiaozhi be the sect elder’s son? He ventured, “Senior Brother Xiaozhi... is Elder Zheng your father?”

“Ah! You guessed it.” Zheng shrugged ruefully. “Being a sect elder’s son means harsher punishments for mistakes, not privileges.”

A Ze rolled his eyes. “Spare us the complaints. Most of us only get wild game by risking these woods. Speaking of which—” He turned to Guanyu. “I admire your daring! Xiaozhi grew up here, but you’ve only joined us two months ago. Yet here you are!”

“Of course!” Guanyu laughed. “I’ve missed roasted meats terribly since arriving. Hunger overcame caution.”

Noticing charcoal remnants from previous fires, Guanyu realized these two were likely the only disciples bold enough to hunt near Tiger Head Peak’s borders, so close to the adjacent Hanging Middle Peak.

“The pheasant’s ready!” A Ze announced, tearing off a massive drumstick. “Junior Brother Guanyu, you’re our guest—take the first portion.”

With gratitude, Guanyu bit into the glistening meat. “Incredible! Senior Brother A Ze, your skills are unmatched!”

“Credit your seasonings,” A Ze demurred. “Xiaozhi and I never had such spices before.”

Xiaozhi sniffed appreciatively. “No wonder it’s aromatic! I thought A Ze finally learned to cook!”

When A Ze kept the second drumstick for himself, Xiaozhi protested, “You glutton! At least share!”

“Catch your own!” A Ze teased, mouth full. “You’ve your father’s treats. We commoners need sustenance!”

Guanyu offered his half-eaten portion, but Xiaozhi declined. “Our bickering’s habitual. Besides—” He gestured at the roasting hare. “My prize awaits!”

As dusk fell, their banter turned to the upcoming Six Peaks Grand Tournament. “They’re restructuring it,” Guanyu shared. “Four finalists will become Sect Leader Xuanming’s direct disciples.”

Xiaozhi groaned. “What motivation is that? Being someone’s disciple hardly matters!”

“Spoken like a man confident of victory!” Guanyu observed.

“Father threatens three years’ seclusion if I fail,” Xiaozhi admitted. “Hence my relentless training.”

A Ze sighed. “Lucky you—personal instruction and magical artifacts. The rest of us scrape by.”

“Ah, the privilege of lineage!” Guanyu quipped.

Xiaozhi produced a glass orb containing glowing insects. “My invention—eternal fireflies!”

“Fake!” A Ze exposed. “Dead bugs coated in phosphorescent powder, floating in water.”

Undeterred, Xiaozhi insisted, “Perfect for courting! I’ll gift this to Siqi of Gathering Peak.”

Guanyu nearly choked—he too admired the renowned beauty. Xiaozhi continued, “You’ve seen Siqi, right? Her beauty stuns all men!”

“Indeed,” Guanyu said casually. “She escorted me to the Ancestral Shrine multiple times.”

The revelation stunned them. “Impossible!” A Ze cried. “She barely acknowledges anyone!”

As night deepened, their laughter echoed through the woods—a camaraderie flavored by rivalry, roasted game, and the unspoken understanding that in matters of love and cultivation, the path ahead promised both competition and unexpected alliances.
