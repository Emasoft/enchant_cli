However, it was evident he had overestimated his authority. Guan Yu didn’t even spare him a glance. Meanwhile, the wolf-woman suddenly produced several daggers and pressed them against Mayor Bard’s neck.

“Guan Yu! Don’t pretend you don’t care! Believe me, I’ll kill him right now!”

Hearing her threat, Guan Yu paused before bursting into laughter. He teased, “Fair lady, I was just wondering why you’d target him. Thought you wanted to vent your frustrations through him. But now I see—you’re using his life to threaten me?”

When the wolf-woman remained silent, Guan Yu continued, “If that’s truly your plan, I must inform you: I barely know this man. His life or death means nothing to me.”

Bika Cat leaped onto Guan Yu’s shoulder, chiming in, “Exactly! Kill him quickly! This old cat wants a good show!”

“You… you heartless bastards!” Mayor Bard whimpered. “After all the hope I placed in you! Ah, I know—you’re resentful I didn’t believe you earlier! I admit my mistake! Save me! Kill this witch, and I’ll reward you with mountains of gold coins!”

**Chapter 1398: A Rice Dumpling?**

The moment Bika Cat turned around, Wolfbane froze. She couldn’t fathom its intentions. Even facing her directly, the cat might struggle to evade—yet now it deliberately turned its back? Was it fleeing?

“Where do you think you’re running, damned cat?” Wolfbane snarled, accelerating her pursuit.

Guan Yu, far from worried, now pitied Wolfbane. Knowing Bika Cat’s habits, he anticipated what came next.

*Zzzt!*

A flash of white light erupted from Bika Cat’s tail, followed by a shrill scream. When Guan Yu looked again, Wolfbane’s face was charred black, her hair standing straight up—a ludicrous sight.

“Hahaha! You wicked cat—that’s brilliantly cruel!”

Humiliated by the electrocution and Guan Yu’s mockery, Wolfbane nearly wished for death. The usually icy woman had never suffered such disgrace. She’d expected to poison Bika Cat effortlessly, only to be outsmarted again!

“I’ll slaughter both of you myself! This is unforgivable!” Wolfbane roared, lunging at Guan Yu.

Unfazed, Guan Yu knew her frenzied state made her easy prey. Yet he had no intention of killing her—she might hold secrets about the Warwolf Mercenaries.

“Bika! Restrain her from behind!”

At Guan Yu’s command, Bika Cat vaulted onto Wolfbane’s shoulders. Before she could react, its tail coiled around her neck like a rope, swiftly binding her limbs until she resembled a trussed-up rice dumpling.

Approaching the immobilized Wolfbane, Guan Yu remarked, “Fair lady, struggling’s pointless. This cat’s tail is tougher than steel—and don’t forget, it conducts electricity. Misbehave again, and…”

The threat worked. Cowed by earlier shocks, Wolfbane stilled, though her dagger-like glare promised murder. Guan Yu shrugged—he’d never feared enemies, least of all these wolf-kin. Better to strike first than wait for their ambush.

“Boss, what now? How do we handle her?”

“Take her back. We’ve been gone hours—I wonder how Emily and Spring are faring.”

Bika Cat nodded but hesitated. Though slender, Wolfbane was still a full-grown woman. Carrying her risked a vengeful bite. Suddenly, the cat brightened. “Boss! Your Spatial Ring! Store her inside!”

Guan Yu blanched. Spatial Rings stored objects, not people—yet parading her through town might cause misunderstandings. Reluctantly, he conceded. “Apologies, lady. Necessity demands this.” Before she could protest, he shoved her into the ring.

As they turned to leave, Bika Cat gestured at the moaning mayor. “What about him?”

“Let him sort himself out. He’ll survive—consider it punishment.” With that, they sped toward the inn.

The streets remained eerily quiet, likely due to rumors about the wolf-woman. Guan Yu scoffed, “These braggarts hide like turtles at the first sign of danger. Pathetic.”

Reaching the inn, they found silence. “Odd,” Guan Yu muttered. “Emily and Spring should be lively. Bika, scout ahead.”

The cat bounded upstairs, returning moments later. “All quiet up there too.”

They entered their rented room—empty. “Where’s the innkeeper? Could the wolf-kin have found us?”

Bika Cat shook its head. “No signs of struggle. If they’d come, this place would be wrecked.”

“Unless the attackers overpowered them instantly.”

As Guan Yu voiced this grim possibility, a voice cried out from behind the door: “Dragon Brother! You’re back!”

Kicking the door open, they found Emily, Spring, and the innkeeper crawling from under the bed.

“Why hide under there? Were you attacked?”

Emily shook her head. “We heard shouts about the witch coming and panicked. Did you catch her?”

“We did. She’s contained.”

**Chapter 1399: The Blue Spatial Ring**

“Contained?!” Spring and the others gasped in disbelief.

Emily stepped forward proudly. “Why the surprise? Dragon Brother’s amazing!” Her tone carried unmistakable ownership, as if declaring Guan Yu her exclusive hero.

Spring teased, “We know he’s incredible, Emily. No need to gloat—some of us might get jealous.” Her sidelong glance at Guan Yu made Emily blush crimson.

Changing the subject, Emily asked, “Where is she? Did you kill her?”

“She’s here.” Guan Yu produced his Spatial Ring.

“How beautiful!” Spring marveled at the azure jewel. Growing up in impoverished Barren Town, she’d never seen such luxury.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Like it? I’ll get you one.”

Emily pouted. “Dragon Brother’s unfair! You’ve never gifted me anything!”

Spring intervened diplomatically. “He doesn’t need to—you’re already family. Giving me this means he still sees me as an outsider.”

Instantly mollified, Emily tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Show me Spring’s present! If it’s not nice, I’ll object!”

Amused by her swift mood shift, Guan Yu produced another ring—his first Spatial Ring, kept for sentimental value. Its sky-blue hue mesmerized Spring, though she demurred, “I can’t accept something so precious!”

“Why refuse what you clearly adore?” Emily snatched the ring and slid it onto Spring’s finger. The moment it settled, Spring’s resolve melted.

Guan Yu patted Emily’s head. “I’ll overlook your rudeness this time. Next, ask before grabbing!”

“You’re always lecturing me like a child!” Emily huffed.

Spring stared at the ring, conflicted. “It’s too extravagant. How can I repay you?”

“Nonsense,” Guan Yu replied. “Among friends, gifts require no repayment.”

The innkeeper eyed it enviously. “That’s worth at least 1,300 gold! My inn would need three years to earn that!”

“Its true value isn’t beauty, but utility.” Guan Yu demonstrated by storing a table inside, leaving the onlookers awestruck.

“Magic!” the innkeeper breathed.

**Chapter 1400: Securing the Wolf-Woman**

Emily gaped at the vanished furniture. “How? It’s so small!”

“A simple incantation.” Guan Yu returned the table with a flick.

Spring finally relented, admiring her new treasure. Meanwhile, Emily’s earlier jealousy transformed into gleeful pride, cementing her unspoken claim over Guan Yu’s affections.

As the group settled, discussions turned to their captive. Guan Yu’s priorities remained clear: extract information about the Warwolf Mercenaries while keeping his makeshift family safe. The blue Spatial Ring glinted on Spring’s finger—a symbol of newfound trust, and perhaps the first spark of something deeper.
