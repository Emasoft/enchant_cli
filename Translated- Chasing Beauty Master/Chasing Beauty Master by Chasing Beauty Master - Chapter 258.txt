“You’re really getting into this act, aren’t you? Keep pretending!” Mo Ling vented her anger on him like a storm, her fists raining down with increased fury.

Guan Yu didn’t resist—nor could he. Under her relentless assault, he began coughing violently, his face flushing crimson. Only then did Mo Ling realize something was wrong. She stopped, her fists trembling as she stared at him with panic-stricken eyes. “What’s wrong with you?”

It took a long while for Guan Yu to catch his breath. “I’m not pretending,” he rasped, a bitter smile tugging his lips. “Though I’m awake, my body feels utterly drained... like I’ve been hollowed out.”

“Why didn’t you say so earlier?” Mo Ling scolded, her cheeks flushing with guilt.

“When did you give me a chance to speak?” Guan Yu retorted, feigning indignation.

Mo Ling’s face reddened further. “You started it. You bullied me first!”

“Bully you? How?” Guan Yu raised an eyebrow, his tone teasing.

“You...! I—ugh, forget it!” Mo Ling huffed, turning away with a mix of embarrassment and coquettish charm.

“So you’re really ignoring me now? Letting regrets linger?” Guan Yu pressed, his smirk widening.

Mo Ling stayed silent, determined to counter his shamelessness with silence.

“What’s so great about me that you’d fall so hard?” Guan Yu prodded.

Still, she refused to answer.

“How would you describe my most dashing moment, Professor Mo?” Guan Yu chuckled, mischief glinting in his eyes.

Mo Ling turned her head away, but Guan Yu persisted. “How about we share a bed tonight to clear up your... misunderstandings about me?”

Mo Ling whirled back, glaring. “I’ll give you the chance—if you’re even *capable* right now.”

Guan Yu’s bravado crumpled. She’d struck his weak spot. In his current state, even lifting a finger was laborious, let alone anything more... strenuous.

“Can I owe you for now?” he bargained weakly.

“No. Opportunities expire,” Mo Ling said triumphantly, savoring her small victory.

A cough interrupted their banter.

Zhang Yi, Mo Ling’s mother, stood at the doorway, her expression unreadable. “Lingling, you’ve been up all night. Rest. You’ll collapse if you push yourself.”

“I’m fine,” Mo Ling protested, reluctant to leave Guan Yu’s side.

“Go,” Guan宇 urged softly. “Bring me something to eat later. I’m starving.”

With a reluctant nod, Mo Ling left.

Alone with Zhang Yi, the atmosphere chilled.

“Thank you for saving her,” Zhang Yi said stiffly.

“It was my duty,” Guan宇 replied.

Zhang Yi’s gaze hardened. “My daughter won’t share a man. Leave her, and we’ll repay you by crushing Cheng Gui politically and financially. Take the deal, or lose everything.”

“What if I refuse?”

“You already accepted when we intervened. The debt is paid.”

Gritting his teeth, Guan宇 nodded. “I’ll take the funds.”

Zhang Yi left, triumphant.

Alone, Guan宇 contemplated his recovery. Why had his drained body revived? The answer lay in energy—desperate absorption.

That night, he crawled to an outlet, charging himself with reckless abandon.

Electricity surged through him, transforming into raw power. His body absorbed it voraciously, strength flooding back.

Then—a voice echoed in his mind:

**Skill Upgrade.**
- *Gravity System* enhanced to 60% efficiency.
- *Healing System* boosted to 60%.
- *Detection Range* expanded to 3 kilometers.
- *Beast Control* duration and precision increased.

Guan宇 grinned. *Now, who dares challenge me?*
