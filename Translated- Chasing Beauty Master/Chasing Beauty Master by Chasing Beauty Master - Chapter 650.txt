After hearing Liu Shilei’s words, Sun Xiaoya became even more convinced that the principal must have assumed something had happened between her and Guan Yu. Just as she was about to explain further, Guan Yu tugged Liu Shilei’s hand and said, “Alright, sis, stop teasing Teacher Sun. You know Old Mrs. Sun has Alzheimer’s. She mistakenly thinks I’m her son-in-law. Tonight, after she falls asleep, I’ll try to treat her. If I can’t cure her, it’ll be inconvenient for me to keep staying and eating at Teacher Sun’s home every day.”

When Guan Yu first arrived at the school, he had little to do and hadn’t yet met Liu Shilei. Staying with Sun Xiaoya wasn’t an issue then, so he felt it best not to attempt treating Old Mrs. Sun’s condition without full confidence. But now, with so many complications arising and Liu Shilei unlikely to approve of him spending days with a beautiful woman, he had no choice but to try healing Old Mrs. Sun. Alzheimer’s, at its core, stemmed from brain degeneration. The restorative power of cultivation spiritual energy should theoretically rejuvenate her mind.

In previous days, Old Mrs. Sun would only rest after seeing Sun Xiaoya and Guan Yu enter their room together, fearing her daughter would kick him out once she slept. But today, exhausted from hosting Liu Shilei—washing dishes and scrubbing pots—she retired early after chatting briefly with the group.

Guan Yu informed Sun Xiaoya he would begin treatment immediately. Expecting acupuncture, Sun Xiaoya was puzzled when Guan Yu simply stood by her mother’s bed. He raised his palms five centimeters above Old Mrs. Sun’s head, closed his eyes, and channeled spiritual energy from his core through his hands.

Sun Xiaoya watched skeptically until tendrils of azure mist emanated from Guan Yu’s palms. She turned to Liu Shilei and whispered, “Principal Liu… is this magic?”

Liu Shilei shook her head subtly, signaling silence. Sun Xiaoya complied, observing intently.

This was Guan Yu’s first attempt at treating Alzheimer’s with spiritual energy. Proceeding with extreme caution, he guided wisps of energy through Old Mrs. Sun’s temples into her fragile brain. Sun Xiaoya flinched when the energy entered her mother’s skull, nearly intervening until Liu Shilei pulled her from the room.

Trembling, Sun Xiaoya gripped Liu Shilei’s hand. “Did you see that? If he makes a mistake… Principal Liu, can he really cure her?”

Though unfamiliar with Guan Yu’s methods, Liu Shilei radiated confidence. Patting Sun Xiaoya’s back, she reassured, “Don’t worry. He’ll heal her.”

Earlier awkwardness forgotten in her worry, Sun Xiaoya now clung to Liu Shilei like an anchor, eyes fixed on the bedroom door.

Within Old Mrs. Sun’s mind, Guan Yu’s spiritual energy mapped her deteriorated brain—vast regions dormant compared to a healthy mind’s vitality. Stimulating the lifeless areas meticulously, he coaxed gradual responses through persistent effort. After thirty minutes, having revived only a tenth of her brain, Guan Yu realized this would require at least ten sessions.

Withdrawing his energy upon hearing Old Mrs. Sun’s steady breathing, Guan Yu quietly exited to the living room. Sun Xiaoya rushed over. “How is she?”

“See for yourself,” he replied, collapsing onto the sofa, drained from the exertion.

As Sun Xiaoya checked her mother, Liu Shilei brought water and guided Guan Yu’s hand to her lap. Despite her forty years, Liu Shilei maintained youthful beauty—her supple thighs eliciting a stir in Guan Yu as he caressed her hand.

Returning, Sun Xiaoya witnessed their intimate gaze and Guan Yu’s hand on Liu Shilei’s thigh. Her mind reeled—their supposed cousin relationship was clearly a facade. Guan Yu must be Liu Shilei’s kept lover! This explained his mid-semester enrollment at the prestigious school. Shock mingled with unexpected jealousy.

Though only twenty-five, Sun Xiaoya had developed unconscious feelings during their forced cohabitation. Now, betrayal sharpened her tongue. “Thank you, Student Guan Yu,” she emphasized bitterly.

Liu Shilei flushed, attempting to withdraw her hand, but Guan Yu held firm. “We’ve been lovers,” he stated plainly. “Ten more treatments are needed. Tonight, we’ll return home. Keep this confidential.”

Sun Xiaoya’s outrage peaked—they dared flaunt this illicit relationship! Liu Shilei’s feeble explanation about knowing Guan Yu for twenty years only deepened the absurdity. How could she have waited for him since infancy?

Unable to confront her principal, Sun Xiaoya vowed resignation post-treatment. Liu Shilei pleaded misunderstanding but ultimately left with Guan Yu.

At Liu Shilei’s suburban villa, stealthy entry avoided alerting the housekeeper. Embracing in the dark foyer, two decades of longing dissolved in passionate kisses. Liu Shilei’s tears mingled joy and sorrow—how could she keep this ageless man as time ravaged her?

“I’ve obtained a Time Reversal cultivation method,” Guan Yu murmured, sweeping her into his arms. “Dual cultivation will restore your youth—permanently.” Blushing, Liu Shilei acquiesced to skin-to-skin practice, darkness veiling their reunion as twenty years evaporated in whispered promises.
