“In the end, Guan Yu looked at Guan Tian and said, ‘Brother, come with me to the dinner party tonight.’”

**Chapter 711: The Two Women Meet**

Guan Yu invited three people to dinner and called Guan Tian to join. The intentions behind this were clear to all. The meal proceeded harmoniously, and as for the matter of “not forgetting the well-digger when drinking water,” Guan Yu trusted Xiao Xiong to handle it well, sparing himself the worry.

The next day, Guan Yu’s group drove Guan Zhongfu to Old Master Feng’s villa. The old man took great care of Guan Zhongfu’s injuries, arranging everything upon their arrival, leaving Guan Yu with little to do.

Ostaku* loved watching *The Deer and the Cauldron*—not for the drama itself, but for the story of Wei Xiaobao and his seven women. Guan Yu had also once adored the series, even idolizing Wei Xiaobao. If even his idol struggled to manage relationships with seven women, how could Guan Yu—with fewer but growing romantic entanglements—possibly fare better?

Yet if Wei Xiaobao ever met Guan Yu, he’d surely regard the latter as his idol. Not only did Guan Yu have more women, but he also maintained harmony among them—a feat worthy of awe. While the outcome was joyous, the journey was fraught with headaches over balancing these relationships. And now, a new headache loomed.

Liu Shilei and Guan Yu entered the room to find Old Master Feng and Guan Zhongfu chatting amiably. Relieved, Guan Yu asked, “Dad, how are you feeling?”

“Wonderful! I’ve never seen a home with such comforts—better than a hospital!” Guan Zhongfu grinned warmly, his yellowed teeth showing. His ease starkly contrasted his earlier stiffness around the old master.

“Guan Yu, who is this?” Old Master Feng finally noticed Liu Shilei.

“Grandpa, this is Liu Shilei,” Guan Yu replied. “My wife.”

Old Master Feng’s expression shifted, scrutinizing Liu Shilei before turning back to Guan Yu. “You’ve met her parents?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Yes, earlier this year.”

“This daughter-in-law of ours is a blessing,” Guan Zhongfu chimed in, beaming.

Old Master Feng sighed, then chuckled. “Very well. Let the young decide their own happiness. I won’t interfere.”

Guan Yu exhaled in relief. “Thank you, Grandpa.”

The old master leaned in conspiratorially. “But if my granddaughter doesn’t mind, neither do I.”

Guan Yu’s smile froze. “I’ll check on Feng Xin’s condition.” He fled the room.

Liu Shilei followed, leaving the two elders bewildered.

**Chapter 712: A Whiff of Jealousy**

“Do you really want to go in?” Guan Yu asked nervously at Feng Xin’s door.

“Afraid I’ll uncover your secrets?” Liu Shilei teased, her smile tinged with醋意 (vinegar—metaphor for jealousy). Though she’d accepted Guan Yu’s other women, a hint of醋意 lingered.

She entered, finding Feng Xin awake. “Hello, I’m Liu Shilei, Guan Yu’s first woman.”

Feng Xin’s gaze sharpened. “Is this true?”

Guan Yu nodded sheepishly.

“Sister,” Feng Xin cooed, her tone suddenly sweet, “Guan Yu never mentioned you.”

Liu Shilei smiled. “I know you. And I know of温情 (Wenqing) and杜晓娟 (Du Xiaojuan).”

Feng欣’s eyes widened. “You know them too?”

“Yes. Since they live under the same roof, I’ve learned much.” Bitterness tinged her voice.

Feng欣’s expression darkened. “There’s also高维 (Gao Wei), the明星 (celebrity) from our school. And李曦 (Li Xi).”

Liu Shilei’s composure cracked. “He… has others?”

**Chapter 713: Ultimate Temptation**

That evening, after treating Guan Zhongfu and Feng Xin, Guan Yu and Liu Shilei headed to a high-end hotel. The air between them crackled with unresolved tension—a storm of醋意 and unresolved questions.

“What did you discuss with Feng Xin?” Guan Yu ventured.

Liu Shilei shot him a look. “You’ll find out tonight.”

The night promised reckoning—for secrets kept,醋意 unspoken, and a tangled web of relationships demanding resolution.
