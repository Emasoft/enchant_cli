“The villas here aren’t cheap. To acquire one, you’d need at least a million. If any property catches your eye, let me know. I happen to know the manager here and might get you a discount,” Liu Fuqiang said with a chuckle.

“No need,” Liu Shilei replied coolly. Unwarranted flattery always harbored ill intentions.

Liu Fuqiang’s expression remained unchanged, as if he had anticipated her reaction. To him, this was merely a coy tactic many women used—feigning indifference to stoke greater interest, ensuring men invested more effort and resources.

“Having more friends opens more paths. Don’t rush to refuse. I’m sure the discount will satisfy you,” Liu Fuqiang persisted.

“With Brother Qiang’s connections, you’d save at least a few hundred thousand, right?” Chen Xiaoyu interjected, playing her role of flattering Liu Fuqiang.

Liu Fuqiang’s eye twitched. A discount of several hundred thousand? No property salesman would offer such a deal. But since the words were out, he’d have to follow through, even if it meant footing the difference himself.

*Sacrificing a few hundred thousand for a stunning beauty? Worth it!*

“Given my relationship with Manager Wang, a five hundred thousand discount should be feasible,” Liu Fuqiang declared.

“Wow! I thought two hundred thousand was generous, but five hundred? Brother Qiang, you’re amazing!” Chen Xiaoyu gushed, though inwardly cursing his extravagance.

Liu Fuqiang basked in her admiration while stealing glances at Liu Shilei, who remained unmoved.

“Guan Yu, let’s look elsewhere. There are other good properties in the city,” Liu Shilei whispered, uneasy about the villa’s astronomical price.

Guan Yu smiled. “Don’t you like this one?”

“It’s perfect… but too expensive. Let’s consider cheaper options,” she replied.

“If you love it, we’ll take it,” Guan Yu said casually.

Liu Shilei gaped. Before she could protest, Chen Xiaoyu sneered, “A brat like you can’t afford this! Only Brother Qiang could. Know your place!”

Liu Shilei’s expression turned icy. “You dare insult my husband? True love isn’t transactional. I pity your shallow understanding.”

Chen Xiaoyu paled, stung by the truth.

Liu Fuqiang, desperate to impress, pointed at the villa. “If you want it, I’ll buy it for you!”

The saleswoman brightened. “This villa costs fifteen million. Cash or check?”

“Fifteen million?!” Liu Fuqiang choked.

For high-end real estate agents, selling a villa meant hefty commissions. This fifteen-million sale would net her half a year’s salary.

When the manager arrived, bowing obsequiously to Guan Yu, the atmosphere shifted.

“Mr. Guan, apologies for the delay. I’ll personally assist you now,” the manager said, dismissing the initial saleswoman.

Guan Yu pointed to the villa. “We’ll take this one.”

“An excellent choice!” the manager fawned.

Liu Fuqiang, realizing his blunder, turned ashen. “The entire villa group belongs to him?!”

After touring the villa, Liu Shilei requested more bedrooms.

“For… future needs,” she murmured, blushing.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Add as many rooms as possible.”

The manager, though puzzled, complied.

As they finalized the purchase, Liu Fuqiang groveled outside, despairing over his folly.

“Strong Brother, what’s wrong?” Chen Xiaoyu asked.

“We’ve offended a titan!” Liu Fuqiang groaned, chasing after Guan Yu to beg forgiveness.
