“Selling silver?” Elder Zheng (Chief Seat) nearly choked with rage upon hearing this, bellowing, “This is a priceless treasure! How could it be sold? If possible, I’d trade my position as Chief Seat for it!”

The moment Elder Zheng uttered these words, the crowd was stunned. Seeing the children’s bewildered expressions, Luo Jie quickly interjected, “Don’t panic. Let me explain. For a cultivator, the most crucial possession is a superior magical artifact. In the martial world, the finest artifacts are classified as high-grade tools, while immortal artifacts have not been seen for ages.

Perhaps because modern cultivators lack the ability to forge immortal artifacts, or because exceptional materials are scarce. Guan Yu’s Imperial Seal, Soul-Severing Blade, and the jade ruyi you gave Siqi are already top-tier high-grade artifacts. But this Dragon’s Eye Amber—it requires no refinement, for it is itself an immortal artifact!”

If the crowd had been astonished before, Luo Jie’s revelation left Guan Yu and the others utterly speechless. An innate immortal artifact? The notion that Wang Jun had casually stumbled upon such a treasure was beyond belief.

“This isn’t suited for you,” Guan Yu snapped, snatching the pearl from Wang Jun’s hand without ceremony.

Before Wang Jun could react, Guan Yu had already leapt away to evade retaliation. Xiao Zhi sprang up next, shouting, “Hand it over! Didn’t you promise this would be Little Yan’s welcome gift? A real man keeps his word!”

“Welcome gift my foot! Elder Zheng said he didn’t want it—it’s mine now!” Guan Yu yelled, his usual composure crumbling in the face of such a treasure.

Wang Jun finally regained his wits, protesting, “Stop fighting! It’s mine! Give it back!” His voice trembled with exhilaration. Who could have imagined the trinket he’d casually picked up was a legendary artifact? Fortune had truly smiled upon him.

Guan Yu tilted his head challengingly. “If you have the guts, come and take it.”

Wang Jun froze. Even with extra limbs, he knew he stood no chance against Guan Yu. The pearl might as well have vanished into the void—once in Guan Yu’s possession, not even Xuan Ming himself could reclaim it without consent.

“Guan Yu... are we still friends?” Wang Jun’s voice cracked with despair, his face a mask of impending tears.

Xiao Zhi chimed in, “Since when do men take back gifts? Have you no shame? Hurry, Little Yan! Demand your present!”

The dining hall of Xuanyuan Peak buzzed like a stirred hornet’s nest. An immortal artifact—a natural one at that—had appeared, and none would let such a treasure slip away.

In truth, Guan Yu meant only to jest. He had no intention of seizing what belonged to another, least of all Wang Jun’s possession. “I don’t want this pearl,” he declared solemnly. “But lend it to me for a day. On my honor, I’ll return it tomorrow.” Rarely did Guan Yu swear oaths, but the artifact’s value warranted reassurance.

His true motive lay deeper. News would spread swiftly, and Xuan Ming would inevitably target Wang Jun first. While Elder Zheng coveted the treasure, his integrity prevented exploitation. Not so for Xuan Ming—a scheming, insatiable man who’d exploit his authority to “borrow” the pearl indefinitely through threats and manipulation.

“Very well. You may borrow it for a day,” Wang Jun conceded, recognizing Guan Yu’s meaningful glance. Trusting his friend’s intentions, he relinquished his claim.

“Return it? This is already Little Yan’s gift!” Xiao Zhi hopped in agitation, barely restraining himself from lunging at Guan Yu. “Hand it over!”

“Enough!” Guan Yu retorted. “Now that Wang Jun knows its worth, how could he part with it? Choose another gift.”

“I want this one!” Xiao Zhi insisted.

“It’s for Du Bingyan, not you! Since when did you become so shameless?” Guan Yu shot back.

Their squabble entertained the onlookers until Luo Jie intervened. “Cease this nonsense! Sit and eat. Xiao Zhi, must you embarrass yourself before your woman?”

“SIT DOWN!” Elder Zheng’s roar silenced the hall. Chastised, Xiao Zhi slumped into his seat.

As the group resumed their meal, Luo Jie addressed Elder Zheng. “Brother, witnessing the Dragon’s Eye Amber is fortune enough. Greater still—Wang Jun’s discovery brings our Cloud Azure Sect an immortal artifact. This is cause for celebration!”

“Indeed! I’ll inform Sect Leader Xuan Ming shortly.” Elder Zheng forced a smile, envy warring with resignation.

The conversation shifted entirely to the amber marvel. Guan Yu remarked, “Wang Jun, thank Elder Zheng’s discernment. Without his wisdom, you’d still be tossing that ‘trinket’ about!”

“True enough,” Wang Jun admitted. “I’ve fiddled with it endlessly since finding it. Who’d have guessed?” Turning to Elder Zheng, he asked, “But why was such a treasure abandoned on the mountain?”

“Not abandoned—likely formed there,” Elder Zheng explained. “The demonic tribes of Miao City cultivate innate powers, oblivious to artifact enhancement. This amber’s significance escaped them.

Legends speak of dragon kings, but amber requires millennia to form. Dragon’s Eye Amber is rarer still. The white variant you possess is the rarest—forged over tens of thousands of years. Red rivals high-grade artifacts; black matches mid-grade ones. A century ago, I saw a black specimen at True Sun Sect.”

Guan Yu interjected, “So white is supreme—a natural immortal artifact requiring no refinement?”

“Precisely,” Elder Zheng nodded. “But immortal artifacts choose their masters. If incompatible, no amount of time breeds obedience—though some yield eventually.”

Wang Jun’s serendipitous fortune left all marveling. “Your trip to Miao City bore wondrous fruit!” Guan Yu laughed.

“Pure luck!” Wang Jun beamed, scarcely believing his ordinary stone was a legend made flesh.

Luo Jie added, “Thank providence you revealed it today. Others might have dismissed it as mere bauble.”

Guan Yu knew Cloud Azure Sect possessed only two immortal artifacts—Hidden Dragon Sword and Merit Cauldron. Yearning to study the amber, he resolved to examine it privately later.

Xiao Zhi grumbled, “Since it’s useless to you, let someone worthy claim it!”

“Nonsense!” Luo Jie chided. “Such treasures aren’t casually gifted. Immortal artifacts possess sentience—they choose masters through affinity or perseverance.”

Changing tack, Guan Yu asked, “Xiao Zhi, when will you wed Du Bingyan? As her ‘family,’ I’ll escort her from Tiger Head Peak in a grand procession with eight bearers!”

Blushing, Du Bingyan murmured, “I’d be honored.”

“Settled then!” Xiao Zhi grinned, overjoyed.

Luo Jie produced an ancient silver bracelet. “This heirloom was my mother’s wedding gift. Now, I pass it to you.”

Trembling, Du Bingyan accepted it with profuse thanks as Luo Jie smiled. “We’re family now. No need for formalities.”

Elder Zheng cautioned, “The girl just arrived. Don’t rush her.”

“Nonsense!” Luo Jie countered. “Xiao Zhi can’t wait. We’ll consult the almanac for an auspicious date.”

Amid laughter, Guan Yu declared, “Let’s host the wedding soon!” The group cheered—all save Wang Jun, who noted the odd pairing: willowy Du Bingyan beside burly Xiao Zhi. Yet the groom’s height and pleasant features softened the contrast.

As festivities resumed, Elder Zheng’s rare smile mirrored the collective joy. Luo Jie’s ancestral bracelet sealed the engagement, while Guan Yu approved of Du Bingyan’s gentle nature. In this moment of camaraderie, even immortal artifacts paled beside human bonds.
