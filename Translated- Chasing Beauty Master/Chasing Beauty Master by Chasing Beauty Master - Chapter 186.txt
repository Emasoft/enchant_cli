“I never expected to see a Korean punk at a Chinese banquet,” Guan Yu retorted sharply.

Piao Xu, fearing he might lose control and stab Guan Yu’s chest right then, snorted heavily and stormed off in a fury.

As he turned away, Guan Yu’s calm voice followed him: “Whatever scheme you’re plotting tonight, I won’t let you succeed.”

Piao Xu didn’t look back, though his face twitched imperceptibly. After a slight pause, he continued walking.

Wen Qing, studying Guan Yu’s resolute profile, teased, “I didn’t realize my husband had so many enemies. This one must’ve started over a woman, right?”

*Ah, women. Must your intuition be so terrifying?*

Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly, avoiding further discussion.

“Let me guess—it’s not any of the ladies at home, or I’d know. Given his murderous glare, the grudge runs deep. You haven’t been in Kyoto long, so Li Xi is unlikely. Back in N City, aside from the captivating Gao Wei, who else could inspire such hatred? Am I right?” Wen Qing arched an eyebrow, her tone playful.

*Whoever claimed “big breasts, no brains” deserved a kick to the face,* Guan Yu thought bitterly.

Mention of Gao Wei conjured her voluptuous figure in his mind—a vision to stir any man’s primal urges.

Since his release from detention, she’d vanished without a trace. Not even Du Xiaojuan had mentioned her. Strange, considering he’d been jailed because of her.

Now reminded, Guan Yu realized he missed her. He resolved to ask Du Xiaojuan later.

“Hey, must you drool so obviously over that starlet? Your wife is standing right here,” Wen Qing remarked acidly.

*Drooling? Where?*

Guan Yu rolled his eyes in protest.

After circling the tedious event with Wen Qing, Guan Yu guided her to a secluded corner for intimate conversation.

Time flew—before any mischief could unfold, the auction commenced.

“Ladies and gentlemen, having mingled sufficiently, we now begin tonight’s auction. The items listed here,” the host brandished a paper, “left me breathless! Prepare for astonishment. Let the bidding begin!”

“I heard *Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains* is among them,” someone whispered.

“Really?” another gasped.

“Insider news. What’s shocking is the donor’s Korean.”

“Tsk. Showing off, that Korean punk.”

Overhearing this, Guan Yu’s frown deepened.

*Fuchun Mountains… Piao Xu?*

**Chapter 459: Sky-High Price**

*What links that painting to profit?* Guan Yu pondered, brow furrowed.

Noticing his tension, Wen Qing joked, “Interested in the painting, dear?”

“Sounds intriguing. Know anything about it?”

“*Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains*—Huang Gongwang’s Yuan Dynasty masterpiece, one of China’s Ten Great Paintings. Priceless. Yet a Korean donated it? Either saintly generosity or sheer audacity.”

“Priceless?” Guan Yu’s eyes glinted. “The donor? You met him earlier.”

Wen Qing grimaced. “That creep who eyed me? A Korean aiding Chinese charity? Never! The painting’s fake.”

Amused by her bias, Guan Yu agreed. “Nor do I believe it’s genuine.”

“But experts here could expose him.”

“Who knows?” Guan Yu smirked toward Piao Xu’s direction.

Meeting his gaze, Piao Xu returned a venomous stare.

“Sir, that student might’ve overheard us in the restroom,” an aide warned Piao Xu.

“So what? We said nothing damning. Focus on the jade harp ring—Mother’s favorite. I’ll secure it.”

**

“Six items tonight—five from board members, one mystery donation, the crown jewel. Let’s begin with Chairman Luo Yuan’s Yuan celadon vase.”

A 3cm vase was displayed.

“Authenticated by Master Appraisers Chen Yuqiang, Gu Yuansheng, and Li Feng. Let’s welcome them!”

Applause erupted.

“Chen Yuqiang came out of retirement! The organizers mean business.”

“They’re really here to vet the mystery item, not the board’s pieces.”

Guan Yu noted—even host Gu Yuansheng doubted the painting’s authenticity.

“Starting bid: 5 million. Minimum increments: 100,000.”

“7 million!”

“9 million!”

Prices skyrocketed.

“Why such huge jumps?” Guan Yu asked.

“Face-giving for Luo Yuan. Pocket change for potential partners,” Wen Qing explained.

“How’d you know?”

“Genius, remember?” She grinned.

The vase sold for 18 million.

Guan Yu marveled—*a fortune for pottery!*

Next: the jade harp ring.

Centered on rare imperial jade, framed by diamonds and emerald, it captivated every woman.

“Though not ancient, its design honors Orpheus’ tragic love. Perfect for your beloveds. Starting bid: 10 million.”

Guan Yu glanced at Wen Qing—entranced.

Bidding frenzy hit 20 million before slowing.

“30 million!” Piao Xu’s shout silenced the room.

Preening under stares, he basked in glory.

“50 million,” Guan Yu stated calmly.

Gasps swiveled toward him.

Piao Xu snarled, “60 million!”

“70 million.”

“80 million!”

“90 million.”

“Sir, control yourself!” Piao Xu’s aide warned.

“100 million!” Piao Xu blurted, breath ragged.

Guan Yu smirked. “Congratulations—it’s yours.”

The room exploded. A billion for a ring!

**Chapter 460: I Bid Ten Billion**

Piao Xu’s glare could’ve slain Guan Yu. “You tricked me!”

“You wanted to compete. Take your prize.” Guan Yu shrugged.

Trapped, Piao Xu choked out, “I… gladly support charity.”

“Why not donate another billion? The children would sing your praises,” Guan Yu pressed.

Piao Xu salvaged pride: “The mystery donor is me. My painting’s proceeds will all go to charity!”

Applause followed.

Guan Yu cut in: “What if it’s fake?”

Silence.

Piao Xu hissed, “Three masters will authenticate it!”

“Yet you ‘donate’ a priceless treasure? How noble!”

“If it’s genuine?” Piao Xu challenged.

“I’ll pay double its final bid,” Guan Yu vowed.

“Let all present witness this!” Guan Yu turned to host Gu Yuansheng.

“You’re certain?” Gu asked.

Both nodded.

“No contracts needed—our reputation suffices,” Piao Xu sneered.

Guan Yu simply smiled.
