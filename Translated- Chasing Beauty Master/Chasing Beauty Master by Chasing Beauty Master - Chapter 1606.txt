Now, Wang Xiaorong was worried about their disguises. If it rained heavily along the way, the animal skin masks she and Guan Yu wore might slip off, exposing their true identities.

Guan Yu said, “No worries. I’ll prepare two bamboo hats later. Once we wear them, we’ll be fine as long as the rainwater doesn’t soak through.”

After everyone was ready, they gathered at the main entrance of the Swordless Inn. There, they handed their room keys to Zou Wuhui.

When Zou Wuhui finished handling the matters and returned to depart, he discovered Zou Wuxiao had vanished. No one knew where the man had gone.

Prince Zou coldly snapped, “That boy grows more unruly by the day! Did he sneak off to drink somewhere again? Send someone to find him immediately!”

Prince Zou’s current entourage numbered over forty, all martial practitioners who had been rigorously tested. Even if they encountered ordinary forces, attacking Prince Zou would prove no easy feat.

Soon, Zou Wuxiao came running from afar, shouting, “Wait for me! Wait for me!”

“Your Highness, my apologies. I must’ve eaten something bad—my stomach turned into raging waves. I just went to the latrine,” Zou Wuxiao explained breathlessly upon arrival, immediately admitting fault.

Prince Zou had intended to reprimand him for not informing others beforehand, but given the urgency of nature’s call, he let it pass and ordered the departure.

Guan Yu suspected hordes of assassins awaited Prince Zou outside. To ensure safety, he suggested the prince avoid marching conspicuously and instead disguise himself.

Prince Zou said, “You mean we should conceal our identities? A sound idea, but how? Many likely already know we’re here.”

“Simple. Our large group is too noticeable. If we split into smaller parties, we’ll evade prying eyes. Whether effective or not, we lose nothing trying.”

“Good. Arrange it. The next town is only an afternoon’s journey—a slight delay matters little.” Prince Zou summoned Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao, instructing them to follow Guan Yu’s orders.

The plan was straightforward. Only Prince Zou and his close aides drew attention; the newly recruited followers were unrecognizable. A simple change of attire would suffice. Guan Yu said, “Fetch plain clothes and ordinary carriages. Change your outfits, and we’ll regroup at noon.”

Guan Yu first dispatched a dozen men with a carriage to rendezvous ahead at Silver Town.

Prince Zou’s group split into three teams. After the first departed, Guan Yu had the prince’s party change clothes and ride in a humble carriage. The third team would follow an hour later.

This way, even if assassins targeted them, they’d struggle to identify which team held the prince—unless they annihilated all three. The strategy heightened security, as outsiders remained unaware.

On the road, Guan Yu’s team numbered nine: his four companions, Zou Wuxiao’s four, and Prince Zou. Zou Wuhui rode inside the carriage while the prince accompanied on horseback—a precaution, as carriages were prime targets during ambushes.

“Spare us, masters! We merely followed orders! Our squad leader said to intercept a group—he never mentioned a prince!”

The lie was blatant. News of Prince Zou’s plight had spread across the jianghu. Even a child would know their true target.

As Guan Yu interrogated, Prince Zou approached. The Imperial Guard soldier, leg slashed, lay immobilized.

Prince Zou demanded, “Answer truthfully, and I’ll spare your life. Otherwise, this becomes your grave.”

Gritting his teeth in pain, the man glared. The prince pressed, “How many Imperial Guards were mobilized against me?”

“A centurion leads over a hundred men. You can’t escape.” Defiance lingered in the soldier’s voice.

Prince Zou chuckled. “Admirable courage. Yet your comrades fled, abandoning you. Why still serve them?”

“How did you know I was in this group?” The prince’s question struck the core.

Indeed, Guan Yu had split them secretly. Even their own men might not recognize the disguised prince. Yet the assassins attacked with certainty—proof of a traitor among them.

“I don’t know. Only the squad leader understood.”

Guan Yu warned, “Play no tricks. Speak truth if you value your life. Where are your remaining forces?”

The man hesitated—a dangerous question. Prince Zou picked up a blade and slashed his wrist. Blood sprayed as the soldier howled.

“Last chance. Where are they?” The prince’s voice turned icy.

Guan Yu glanced at him, surprised by this ruthless side. The prince’s swift brutality contrasted his earlier mild demeanor. Perhaps prolonged pursuit had hardened him.

“I truly don’t know! Spare me, masters! I’m just a foot soldier following orders!”

Prince Zou tossed the blade aside. “Let’s move on. This pawn knows nothing.”

Zou Wuhui asked, “Your Highness, what of the wounded?”

“Kill them. The Imperial Guards would finish them anyway. Mercy lies in a quick death.”

His logic held—survivors would be silenced. The group hastened onward, wary of further ambushes. Guan Yu speculated the Imperial Guards might have split forces too, attacking all three teams.

Upon reaching Silver Town, they found the first team waiting unharmed—no signs of conflict. Settling into an inn, the third team arrived by dusk.

**Chapter 4172: Unmasking the Spy**

In Prince Zou’s room, Guan Yu voiced suspicions: “Your Highness, I believe we have a traitor—likely an Imperial Guard plant.”

“Why?”

“Our three-team strategy was secret. Yet they pinpointed your group. Someone must’ve leaked your position.”

The prince nodded. “But how identify the rat among hired mercenaries?”

“The first team didn’t know your location. The traitor must be in the later groups. Grant me a day to uncover them.”

Approving this, Prince Zou extended their stay. That evening, Guan Yu announced strict curfew: none could leave without Zou Wuhui’s permission.

In their room, Wang Xiaorong cleaned her precious crossbow bolts—irreplaceable due to their solid mercury tips.

Xiao Zhi asked, “Danger tonight? No sleep?”

“Stay alert,” Guan Yu replied. “The spy will try contacting the Guards. We’ll watch for movement.”

Wang Jun complained, “Why the lockdown? We wanted to explore!”

“The spy’s among the later recruits. They’ll slip up.” Guan Yu explained. “The first team’s cleared—they departed before knowing your position.”

Xiao Zhi suggested interrogating all suspects, but Guan Yu preferred patience. “The traitor will surface. Tonight, expect action.”

As darkness fell, vigilance heightened. The inn’s walls held secrets, but Guan Yu’s plan was set—the spy’s moment approached.
