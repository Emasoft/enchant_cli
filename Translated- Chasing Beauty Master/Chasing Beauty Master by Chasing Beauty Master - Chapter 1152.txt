Jia Bo calculated in his mind. Even if the bar and club required luxurious renovations, fifteen million would suffice. After pacifying the injured customer with the remaining funds, the leftover money would become his and Wei Hongwei's personal windfall. Such a lucrative arrangement would delight anyone.

He had already devised a plan. Last night's Xiangzhu (Fragrance Master) who maintained good relations with him would handle the subsequent matters—a mere 1.5 million would suffice.

At that moment, Wei Hongwei, having heard of recent events, entered from outside. “Boss, I heard this was Poisonous Widow’s doing? It’s clearly a provocation against our Yu Gang. We can’t swallow this insult!”

Guanyu replied, “Of course this matter won’t end here. Quickly arrange the next steps and gather all Yu Gang members. Wait for my orders tonight.”

Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei nodded simultaneously. After Guanyu departed, he returned directly to Qiaoyuan District with Xue Jing and contacted Jones. Though Yu Gang had many members, they were ordinary people—effective in numbers but vulnerable against Poisonous Widow’s cultivators. Jones’ assistance would be crucial.

Guanyu knew the Feng family operated a large garment factory in the northern suburbs, handling international orders and producing globally renowned brands.

Bill Lin’s actions demanded tenfold retribution. Tonight, Guanyu planned to rally forces and disrupt the Feng family’s factory until operations ceased—only then would his fury subside.

That evening, Guanyu drove to Yu Gang’s base, now teeming with members. Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei reported, “Boss, we’ve gathered everyone except Wang Hu’s faction. Over three hundred are present.”

Guanyu chuckled wryly. “I didn’t ask for the entire gang. A hundred would’ve sufficed. But since they’re here, let them join.”

Wei Hongwei added, “Teams are organized—four per car, thirty vehicles total. We’re ready to move at your command.”

“Our target is the Feng family’s garment factory in the northern suburbs. We strike hard—smash everything. Leave no mercy. Understood?”

After Guanyu’s orders, the convoy departed. Watching the fleet of silver-gray vans, he felt adrenaline surge—such formidable momentum proved Yu Gang’s growing influence.

As Guanyu prepared to leave, his phone rang—Qi Zhi calling. Earlier, he’d contacted Hou Jinshun to reserve a spot for drinks while awaiting news from the operation.

“Guanyu, my phone died, so I’m using Qi Zhi’s. Didn’t you plan to visit tonight? Your seat’s reserved,” said Hou Jinshun.

“On my way. Hold the spot,” Guanyu replied before joining the club.

Meanwhile, Jones’ team waited in the northern suburbs to protect Yu Gang members. Though the Feng factory likely lacked heavy defenses, caution necessitated backup.

The thirty-car procession resembled a serpent winding through the night. After they departed, Guanyu and Xue Jing arrived at the Flower Night Club.

Inside, Hou Jinshun waved from a dimly lit table. “You’re late! We’ve already had a round,” he complained.

“Delayed by business. Perfect timing for the club’s peak hours,” Guanyu replied, accepting a drink as Xue Jing received juice.

“What’s more important than drinks?” Hou Jinshun teased.

Guanyu’s expression darkened. “Poisonous Widow destroyed my venues last night. They’re closed for renovations.”

“How brazen! A Ten Great Villain indeed,” Qi Zhi interjected. “Will you let this slide?”

“Of course not. My men are delivering a ‘gift’ as we speak,” Guanyu smirked.

Qi Zhi pressed, “What’s your plan?”

Guanyu studied him. “Just securing my properties. Why the urgency, Qi Zhi?”

“Merely curious about your feud with Bill Lin,” Qi Zhi deflected.

Changing topics, Guanyu hinted at undermining Bill Lin’s schemes at the leather factory through bribes—a fabricated tale to test Qi Zhi’s loyalty.

Meanwhile, Yu Gang forces reached the illuminated factory. Workers toiled inside as guards watched TV, oblivious until three hundred members stormed the gates, overturning barriers and flooding the compound.

Ink bombs splattered machinery and fabrics—ruining production. Guards cowered, dialing authorities too late.

Back at the club, Guanyu monitored time. No calls meant success.

Qi Zhi feigned interest: “Need help against Bill Lin?”

“Three hundred men suffice,” Guanyu boasted. “The factory won’t recover soon.”

Subtly, he watched for tells—a fidgeting phone, bathroom breaks—but Qi Zhi remained still.

Guanyu spun lies: Bill Lin’s planted client at the leather factory had been bribed. If Qi Zhi was a mole, this misinformation would reach Bill Lin, sowing distrust.

Yet Qi Zhi showed no reaction. Either he was innocent or exceptionally controlled. Xue Jing’s glance confirmed the stalemate—the trap remained unsprung.
