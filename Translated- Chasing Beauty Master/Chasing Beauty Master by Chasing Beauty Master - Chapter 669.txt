To be honest, Ouyang Yihan hadn't known Guan Yu for long, having only met him a few times. Yet she was well-acquainted with his exploits, particularly the two-decade vigil maintained by Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan. This convinced her Guan Yu must be the perfect lover—how else could such stunning women, who could command admirers wherever they went, remain devoted to his memory for twenty years?

What woman doesn't dream of an ideal partner? Yet such men are rare, sometimes forcing compromises. Ouyang Yihan asked herself: Would she rather share a remarkable man or endure a lifetime with mediocrity? Her conclusion was clear—she could never abide an unloved companion by her side.

Originally bound by family duty to marry Yu Zhengchun, she'd planned to end her life after he stole weapons from Dongdao Island for the Ouyang clan. But Guan Yu's intervention changed everything. With Yu subdued and threats neutralized, Guan Yu's superior strength, combined with Huanyu Group's resources and allies like Meng Feilong, offered the Ouyangs salvation even without retrieving those weapons.

Prior to this meeting, the Ouyang clan convened and concluded this crisis might instead be an opportunity.

Huanyu Group's meteoric rise—from modest enterprise to China's top ten in two decades—revealed Du Xiaojuan's formidable acumen and connections. Witnessing Guan Yu effortlessly defeat two First-Class Mutants (currently invincible in China) further convinced Ouyang Yihan. A godlike warrior commanding vast corporate power—what couldn't he achieve? Aligning with this colossus promised security.

Though aware of Ouyang Yihan's feelings and his lovers' acceptance (past paramours like Mo Ling coexisted harmoniously), Guan Yu hesitated. If her interest stemmed merely from gratitude over saving her family, he wanted no part of it.

To Guan Yu, loveless unions were mutual torment. Glancing at Ouyang's exquisite features and curvaceous figure, he chuckled: "Why seek compensation when perfection stands before you? Speaking of which, Huanyu's developed lifelike robots. Want one? Market value exceeds tens of millions—consider it reparations."

Ouyang gritted her teeth at his teasing smirk. "Nonsense! Even America lacks such tech. Prove it!" she challenged, closing in until her ample bosom nearly brushed his chest.

Guan Yu fought the urge to nip her flushed cheeks. "Suppose we did create one. What then?"

"Then do as you please," she retorted, emphasizing "do" suggestively. The charged word stirred Guan Yu, though he restrained himself, uncertain if her advances were genuine or obligated.

Summoning assistant Huang Yating via intercom, he presented her as the android. Ouyang gaped when Huang parted her scalp to reveal synthetic internals. "Enough! I believe you!" she cried, shielding her eyes.

Post-demonstration, Ouyang marveled at the indistinguishable realism. Guan Yu gestured Huang away. "Satisfied? Describe your ideal man, and we'll craft him."

Ouyang's smile turned impish. "Easy—make one exactly like you. Same looks, personality, combat skills...everything." As Huang discreetly exited, Ouyang bit her lip and leaned in.

"This is on you," Guan Yu mentally noted, intrigued by this rare woman who prioritized family over personal freedom.

Feigning retreat, he let her press closer. "Well? Can you deliver?" she whispered, breath tickling his ear.

"Simple enough," he murmured, seizing her waist. A gasp escaped her as their bodies aligned, her willpower melting under his touch.

During Guan Yu's legendary era, he'd become millions' fantasy—even married women like Sun Xiaoya's mother envisioned him as son-in-law. For Ouyang, embracing this dream felt surreal yet intoxicating. "So...warm," she sighed, nuzzling his chest.

Neither saint nor fool, Guan Yu claimed her lips. As passion escalated, Ouyang suddenly pushed away. "Not here! Tonight, my hotel. And I'll be Third Wife, not Fourth!"

Guan Yu smirked. "Too late—Sun Xiaoya claimed third two nights ago."

"Damn! I should've made my move earlier!" She stamped her foot. "Tell her I was first! Or else..." Grabbing his collar, she threatened: "No admission without that lie."

Bemused by her rivalry-over-jealousy mindset, Guan Yu acquiesced to secrecy about their unconsummated status. After extracting his promise and hotel details (with strict attendance orders to prevent "Fifth" or "Sixth" wives), they returned to the meeting.

By then, Ouyang Zhenghad and Du Xiaojuan had drafted merger documents. Guan Yu rubber-stamped the agreements, shaking hands with his new father-in-law before announcing a joint press conference in three days.

That evening's Huanyu banquet revealed deeper machinations. Du Xiaojuan had invited military commanders, police vice-ministers, and even the Dragon Group leader—a power play masked as celebration.

Approaching General He, Du Xiaojuan toasted: "Your presence honors us." The silver-haired commander reciprocated, eyeing Guan Yu. "A pleasure finally meeting our wandering hero. Youth suits you well, unlike my weathered self."

Their exchange resonated through the room. For the Ouyangs, this demonstrated Huanyu's—and Guan Yu's—unspoken authority. That these titans attended a hastily arranged event spoke volumes.

As negotiations progressed, Guan Yu's mind wandered to Wang Manqing and Xu Ying—potential and forbidden fruits respectively. Meanwhile, Du Xiaojuan shouldered corporate burdens, content to let her man focus on greater battles. Her devotion mirrored Liu Shilei's—both women finding fulfillment in support rather than rivalry.

Whether through charisma or fortune, Guan Yu's harem thrived on mutual affection, not competition. As the night deepened, alliances solidified and futures intertwined, the true game—far beyond corporate mergers—had only just begun.
