At this moment, an inexplicable sense of superiority flared in Guan Yu's heart, yet it vanished within seconds. After enduring countless trials, he understood profoundly: there are always higher mountains and greater people beyond one's current standing.

If one constantly associates with inferiors, they will inevitably decline to that level. Conversely, surrounding oneself with formidable individuals spurs relentless self-improvement until one ascends to greatness.

Observing Moffy, Guan Yu suddenly realized—this man mirrored his former self. The sole difference lay in Moffy being slightly more unscrupulous, though given choice, neither would willingly choose such a path.

Moffy's cunning diplomacy merely carved survival space among stronger peers. Yet he wasn't irredeemably evil, still capable of redemption.

With this thought, Guan Yu patted Moffy's shoulder. “Moffy, would you learn higher-tier magic from me?”

Though spoken softly, these words struck Moffy like thunder. Since joining the Hun Tian Sect, he’d mastered sycophancy but never proper magic. Poverty had forced him into this life of peril without reward—only endless beatings and mockery.

Now, someone offered magical tutelage? It felt surreal. He stood frozen until a heavy slap jolted his skull, accompanied by roaring rebuke.

“You fool! Young Master Guan offers teaching—why aren’t you kowtowing in thanks?”

Harris's blow shocked Moffy awake. He rushed before Guan Yu, thudding to his knees with tear-choked voice: “Thank you, Young Master! If you truly teach me magic, I’ll serve you as ox or horse—no, I’ll do anything! I...”

Mid-speech, Harris yanked him up, snarling: “Enough! A grown man sniveling—how disgraceful! What must Young Master think of our sect?”

Mentioning Guan Yu worked. Moffy wiped snot and tears, ceasing sobs. Harris smiled obsequiously: “Forgive his lack of decorum, Young Master. He’s inexperienced in grand affairs.”

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “When did I take offense? You, however—cease this brutishness. It reeks of low breeding.”

Chastised despite attempted flattery, Harris swallowed irritation. He had another request.

“Young Master... your offer to teach Moffy—is it genuine?”

Guan Yu glared. “Did I sound jesting?”

“N-no! Merely... such sudden fortune left me unprepared...”

Guan Yu frowned. “Unprepared? What’s your stake here?”

“Well... Moffy’s my subordinate. If you teach him, I must learn too! How else lead him?”

“Ah.” Guan Yu stroked his chin. “Then I propose a perfect solution.”

“What solution?” Harris’s eyes glinted like a starved wolf’s.

Guan Yu drawled: “Simple—Moffy needn’t remain your subordinate.”

“What?!” Harris reddened with fury. “None dare poach from Harris! Push further, and I’ll—”

A thunderous crash interrupted. The waiting serpent lunged. Harris scrambled backward—too slow. As fanged jaws loomed, blue light exploded.

When Harris dared open eyes, the serpent had vanished. Guan Yu stood calmly, faint azure sigil fading from his palm. Though the mystic-tier skill seemed basic, its pristine elemental purity—unseen by Harris—had effortlessly repelled the beast.

“You were saying?” Guan Yu inquired innocently.

“I-I meant... if you insist on taking Moffy, who am I to refuse? Haha!”

Harris’s hollow laughter drew suppressed snickers from underlings. Never had they seen their tyrant so cowed. Envy gnawed them—had they known Guan Yu’s blows granted magical tutelage, they’d have queued for pummeling.

Enraged by the rebuff, the serpent returned fiercer. The gang cowered behind Guan Yu—their newfound protector.

Yet one figure stood apart—Moffy, staring down the charging monstrosity.

“Fool! Get back here!” Harris shouted.

Moffy shook his head. “I’ll face hardship head-on, as Brother Guan Yu taught.”

As shadow loomed, Moffy closed eyes... until slicing wind brought azure brilliance. The serpent’s head tumbled—decapitated by Guan Yu’s brutal efficiency.

“Stunned again?” Guan Yu waved before Moffy’s gaping face.

“H-how...?” The gang stood dumbstruck. Such power—their wildest dreams!

**Chapter 1453: Stunned**

Moffy trembled post-ordeal. Guan Yu approached: “Courage matters, but reckless bravery without self-awareness? That’s folly costing lives.”

Confused, Moffy asked: “But you said confront difficulties...”

Guan Yu smiled. “Discernment comes through experience. Surviving adversity requires eyes distinguishing true danger—lessons no book teaches.”

Overwhelmed, Moffy’s eyes welled. “What virtue earned me your guidance? ‘One wise conversation surpasses ten years’ study.’ I’m illiterate, yet now cultured through your words!”

Guan Yu marveled inwardly—the lad’s glibness hid sharp wit and potential.

“Enough cheek!” Harris barked. Moffy scratched head: “Apologies... I’ve never met someone like Brother Guan Yu.”

Guan Yu recognized genuine gratitude, recalling his own yearning for mentorship.

As dusk fell, Harris suggested camping. Guan Yu acquiesced, needing solitude to probe his amnesiac past. Only his name remained—yet conviction burned: memories would return.

The group efficiently pitched tents. Guan Yu wandered beneath constellations—the Big Dipper gleaming—pondering lost family. Their efficiency impressed; the campsite surpassed his own capabilities.

Hunger loomed. A voice提议: “Why not eat the serpent?”

Approval surged. Harris sought Guan Yu’s consent.

“Agreed. I’ll taste serpent meat.”

Men retrieved the carcass and gathered firewood. Soon, skewered蟒蛇肉 sizzled over flames. Guan Yu imitated their cooking, Moffy beside him.

“Never野外烧烤 before, Young Master?”

Guan Yu admitted awkwardness. “You seem experienced.”

“Monthly, we spend days thus. We’re like mercenaries—but fighting for survival, not commissions. You see us weak... yet our burdens are heavy. Slackening means starvation. This hardship tempers us.”

Guan Yu’s perspective shifted—these men endured much.

Noticing his pensiveness, Moffy asked: “Young Master?”

“Call me Brother Guan Yu. I’m likely elder.”

**Chapter 1454: The Big Dipper**

Moffy beamed. “Brother Guan Yu! Another brother—today’s joy!”

His simplicity touched Guan Yu. “Your family... have you contacted them?”

Moffy’s smile died. “Two years since I visited. My ailing mother... I don’t know if she...”

“Don’t speak ill-omens!” Guan Yu chided.

**Chapter 1455: Aromatic Serpent Meat**

The烤蛇肉香气wafted. Moffy’s tale continued: “I left seeking coin for her medicine. The sect... they promised gold but gave only scars.”

Guan Yu’s fist clenched. “We’ll visit your mother. Soon.”

Tears spilled anew—not from fear, but hope rekindled. Around the fire, men ate their fill, unaware this night marked their rebirth.

Guan Yu gazed skyward,北斗七星twinkling—beacons guiding lost memories home.
