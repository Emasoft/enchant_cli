“Oh, it’s fine. The excavation has reached its final stages, and certain things should be revealed to the public now. By the way, these two are my students, here to assist me with some matters.”

Guan Yu and his companion nodded politely at the staff before Cheng Yaohai led them further ahead. Xia Yue’er gasped first: “Heavens! Is this... truly an ancient ruin? How could such a thing exist?”

Guan Yu followed her gaze and froze, his controlled composure crumbling as an involuntary exclamation escaped him.

Before them lay a massive pit—three meters long, two meters wide, and five meters deep—encircled by wooden stakes to prevent accidental falls. At its center rested a translucent jade coffin, through which the outline of a corpse could be seen.

“Impressive, isn’t it?” Cheng Yaohai smiled at their stunned expressions. “According to archaeological records, the world’s earliest jade coffin belonged to Liu Fei, younger brother of Emperor Wu of Han, discovered alongside the famed golden-threaded jade burial suit. While this tomb lacks such a suit, its ten-thousand-year age alone will shake the world!”

Xia Yue’er gaped but voiced doubt: “Could the dating be wrong? Perhaps this is only a thousand years old?”

Before she finished, Cheng Yaohai shook his head confidently. “We’ve repeatedly tested most relics here with cutting-edge technology. Every datum confirms this site predates ten millennia!”

Guan Yu, now past shock, hurriedly snapped photos with his camera’s flash. Zooming in, a chill crawled down his spine. “Uncle Cheng, the person in the coffin looks...”

“I know—terrifying, right?” Cheng interjected. “Though unopened, three conclusions emerge: First, skeletal features and the diamond-studded golden crown indicate an elite female. Second, her contorted posture suggests live burial. Third, her death likely involved a curse.”

“A curse?”

Rather than fear, Guan Yu now felt pity. His mind conjured the woman’s final moments: thrashing in darkness, screaming hoarsely until death claimed her in that airless tomb...

“Look! What’s this?”

Xia Yue’er’s sudden cry snapped Guan Yu from his thoughts. She stared transfixed at her camera screen.

Guan Yu grabbed the camera. On the corpse’s wrist glimmered a faint purple light—a crescent-shaped bracelet when magnified.

Cheng Yaohai had stated the coffin was only unearthed today. How then did the old water-seller outside know of this bracelet? Could she foresee the future? And who was this “Crescent Princess” she mentioned?

“Coincidence!” Guan Yu muttered. Turning to Xia Yue’er, he froze. The once-excited girl now stood catatonic, staring vacantly at the coffin.

“Yue’er! What’s wrong?”

After multiple calls, she shuddered awake, pallid. “I... suddenly feel dizzy. Can’t breathe...”

“Normal reaction,” Cheng explained. “Sealed caves often contain irritants. Newcomers may experience discomfort—even hallucinations.”

Reassured, Guan Yu patted her back. “Better now? Let’s step outside.”

She shook her head. “I’ll be fine. We must document this rare chance!”

A commotion outside interrupted: “Look! The sky’s darkening!”

Guan Yu checked his watch—noon. “A solar eclipse!” Cheng realized. “Today’s the Lunar New Year, a syzygy. Yue’er, Guan Yu—stay here. I’ll investigate!”

As Cheng left with staff, journalists followed, scenting bigger news in the eclipse.

“So many oddities today. Let’s finish and leave,” Guan Yu said, turning—and recoiled.

Xia Yue’er now thrashed wildly, eyes bulging, chanting: “Let go! Don’t kill me!”

This wasn’t the girl he knew. When Guan Yu tried restraining her, she flung him aside with preternatural strength. A purple glow erupted from the coffin—the crescent bracelet now fluorescing eerily.

“It’s that accursed thing!”

As Guan Yu lunged again, Xia Yue’er broke free and dove toward the pit. He barely caught her arm, anchoring himself between stakes—but the loosening posts creaked dangerously.

“Help! Anyone!”

His cries faded unheard as chaos reigned outside. Just as hope waned, footsteps approached—but Guan Yu’s relief curdled to dread.

The newcomer was Li Tian, their stalker. “Tsk tsk,” he mocked. “Need a photo of this pathetic scene?”

“Li Tian! Forget our feud—Yue’er’s losing her mind!”

Li Tian laughed. “Madness suits her! You claim to love her—does sanity matter?”

“You’ll regret this!” Guan Yu snarled.

“Oh, I’ll show you true villainy!” Li Tian stomped Guan Yu’s hand, breaking his grip. As they plummeted, Guan Yu grabbed Li’s leg—dragging all three into the pit.

*Thud!*

They crashed onto the coffin, cracking its surface. When rescuers arrived after a blinding purple flash, the trio had vanished.

**Chapter 1450: Recruitment**

Guan Yu awoke to rancid stench. A bearded brute loomed inches from his face, inspecting him like prey.

“Defensive positions!” an elder barked.

Planks clattered as men encircled Guan Yu. Through parted barriers emerged an old man and youth. “Bazaar, take arms!”

The boy hesitantly lifted a sharpened stick. Guan Yu blinked confusedly. “Are you actors?”

“Enemy spy?” a scrawny lackey whispered.

“Idiot!” the leader barked. “Can’t you see he’s clearly abnormal?”

Amidst absurd banter, Guan Yu wondered: *Another transmigration? This makes three before thirty!*

When the lackey attacked, Guan Yu instinctively blocked—sending the man flying.

The leader paled. “You... from Black Wind Sect?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “I know nothing. Stop asking nonsense.”
