“Exactly,” Bika Cat chimed in. “Old man, think about it. If we were villains, we’d have killed you during the hours you lay unconscious. Would you even have this chance to sit here listening to our explanations?”

Though still frightened, the innkeeper gradually accepted the presence of these two uninvited guests. Their words held logic—after all, they hadn’t threatened his life yet, which already made them infinitely better than yesterday’s monster.

Yet bitterness welled in his heart. Why such misfortune? Yesterday he’d barely survived a deranged bloodsucking fiend, and today he hosted a talking cat! Resigned, he could only pray, knowing they could end him as easily as swatting a fly.

“You must know what interests us,” one said calmly. “Stay composed and tell us everything about that creature. We’ll stay tonight and leave tomorrow. Agreed?”

The innkeeper nodded wearily. “Very well. At this late hour, you’d find no shelter elsewhere... and might encounter that monster...”

“Then tell us—where did it flee after attacking yesterday?”

After a pause, the innkeeper pointed to the nearest hill. “After killing its victim, it fled there. This town is called Guiku Zhen—‘Ghost Wail Town,’ a desolate place of spectral howls.”

Guan Yu frowned. Naming a settlement after ghostly wails seemed ill-omened. “Why such a name? This lies between human and elven territories—shouldn’t it thrive?”

“In my youth, it prospered. But when humans and elves clashed here, countless young men were conscripted. After battles raged, widows outnumbered the living. Though the name mocks, I find no humor in war’s ravages.”

Guan Yu’s hatred for war deepened. Without conflict, this could have remained vibrant. His thoughts turned to Locke, the elven warmonger. If that hawk became elder, war would erupt anew within three years—regardless of who struck first, the outcome would be catastrophic.

“Wherever you hide, Locke, I’ll hunt you down!”

“That hill,” the innkeeper continued, “was the bloodiest battlefield. Ten thousand souls perished there. After nightfall, their wails haunt the air.”

“But why stay in this dreadful place?” Guan Yu asked.

“Ah, youth cannot understand attachment to ancestral soil. When aged, you’ll know—a leaf returns to its roots.”

Guan Yu pondered his own lost homeland. Before he could dwell further, a scream pierced from upstairs. “Bika! With me—now!”

They burst into Amy’s room to find her trembling on the bed, staring at the desk. “Brother Longzu! Something... under there!”

In the midnight gloom, the desk’s shadowed underside seemed ominous. Guan Yu’s neck prickled. “Bika, you’re small—check beneath. I’ll guard Amy.”

The cat’s fur bristled. “Boss! Shouldn’t you face dangers first? Let me protect Miss Amy!”

“Disobey, and I’ll dump you in the mass graves on that hill!”

Grumbling, Bika slithered under the desk. As Guan Yu and Amy watched, a mournful yowl erupted. Guan Yu yanked Bika out as a shadow darted away.

“A rat! A RAT!” the cat shrieked, quivering.

Guan Yu nearly cursed. A cat—afraid of rodents? Before he could react, knocking interrupted.

“Who’s there?”

“Young sir, it’s the innkeeper. Heard a cat’s cry—is all well?”

Upon entering, the man paled at mention of the rat. “Impossible! My inn never had vermin—until two nights past. Swarms overran streets, fearless of humans! We drove them off with torches... then the monster came.”

“Coincidence?”

“Perhaps. But Ghost Wail Town never saw such plague before. That talking cat—surely it hunts rats?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Ask it yourself.”

Approaching nervously, the innkeeper bowed. “Lord Cat... can you repel them?”

“Lord Cat?” Bika preened until Guan Yu’s glare silenced him. “Ahem. If rats herald the monster’s approach, it’s nearby!”

Nodding, Guan Yu hesitated. Hunting the beast meant leaving Amy vulnerable. Yet this chance to find Locke’s trail couldn’t be wasted.

“Guard her well,” he ordered Bika before venturing out.

Moonlight bleached the deserted streets. A mournful wail echoed from an alley—ghostly, chilling. Guan Yu followed, senses alert. The cry led to a crumbling courtyard.

Peering from the roof, he saw a lit room where a girl sobbed over an old man. “Grandfather, hold on! Don’t leave me alone!”

“Spring... flee... before it returns...”

Guan Yu dropped into the yard. “Peace! I mean no harm.”

The girl, Liu Chun Tian, explained her grandfather Liu Yishou—“Skilled Hand”—had fought a wolf-like monster wielding magic. Though a senior swordmaster, he now lay poisoned.

Guan Yu produced a dozen rejuvenation pills. The old man gasped—each worth a commoner’s yearly wage. “We can’t accept such—”

“For your granddaughter,” Guan Yu insisted. “Would you abandon her to solitude?”

Relenting, Liu Yishou swallowed a pill. As color returned, distant howls split the night—the hunt was on.
