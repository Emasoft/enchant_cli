Observing the other’s expression, Guan Yu sensed his words had struck a chord. He pressed on, “Moreover, Senior Brother Lin Chen, I know you’re also fond of Siqi. How can you stand idly by while Senior Brother Ling Su clings to her day after day? Doesn’t it infuriate you?”

“A little, perhaps,” Lin Chen admitted sheepishly. “But since Siqi has openly expressed her aversion to Ling Su, then…”

“She only mentioned Ling Su to me,” Guan Yu interjected quickly. “I find it curious she didn’t speak of you. Given how close the two of you usually are, her singling out Ling Su suggests he must have wronged her somehow. Senior Brother Lin Chen, do you think Ling Su might have done something to offend Siqi?”

Lin Chen paused, considering this. “She truly didn’t mention me? Only her dislike for Ling Su? Now that I think of it, I’ve noticed it too. Siqi is, after all, a young woman. Ling Su buzzing around her like an incessant fly is utterly repulsive.”

Guan Yu stifled a laugh. This fool was even more gullible than he’d hoped. “Of course she didn’t mention you. But now that you mention it, he does resemble a fly. If you were Siqi, wouldn’t you despise such behavior?”

Adopting a grave tone, Guan Yu continued, “I’ve long observed your affection for Siqi, Senior Brother. While compromise is usual in most matters, this is a critical juncture. You cannot cede ground to Ling Su. If they grow closer by the day, aren’t you afraid Siqi will leave for good? Besides, I doubt you wish to see them truly unite. You must intervene—warn Ling Su. Not only would this prevent Siqi’s departure, but it would also elevate your standing in her eyes.”

Gesturing toward a distant rock where Siqi sat listlessly with Ling Su hovering nearby, Guan Yu added, “Look, Senior Brother. Anyone would be driven mad by such pestering. Speak to him before it’s too late. If Siqi storms off, I’ll lack the courage to bring her back.”

Lin Chen followed his gaze, noting Siqi’s visible irritation and Ling Su’s grinning chatter. “I’ll confront him at once. This has gone too far,” he declared, striding forward.

“Wait.” Guan Yu held him back. “A final word, Senior Brother. You may yield in other matters, but when it comes to the woman you love, do not surrender her to another. Regret will follow swiftly otherwise.”

With a resolute nod, Lin Chen approached Ling Su. Guan Yu smiled. The seeds of discord were sown; their camaraderie would never be the same.

“Ling Su, come with me. We need to talk,” Lin Chen demanded, clapping a hand on his shoulder.

“Can’t this wait? I’m busy,” Ling Su snapped, irked by the interruption.

“Busy? With what? Deluding yourself into thinking your antics charm her? Look at Siqi’s face—she loathes you more than a swarming pest!” Lin Chen spat, venting Guan Yu’s earlier words.

“This is your only warning. Ignore it, and don’t come crying to me later.”

“Who are you calling a pest?” Ling Su sneered. “Spare me your sanctimony.”

Infuriated, Lin Chen dragged Ling Su aside. “If you persist, Siqi will return to the Yunqing Sect! Have you no sense?”

Though their quarrels were frequent, their underlying camaraderie usually mended rifts quickly. But now—

“Why? Is the journey too arduous for her?” Ling Su asked, feigning concern.

“Don’t play the fool! She can’t endure your ceaseless buzzing. If you don’t stop, she’ll leave. Our party’s sole beauty gone—how dreary the road ahead would be!”

Ling Su smirked. “Nonsense. My charm and warmth ensure her fondness.” He adjusted his collar preeningly.

“Your delusion astounds me,” Lin Chen retorted. “She wrinkles at the sight of you as if facing a gargantuan fly.”

Ling Su eyed him suspiciously. “Jealous, aren’t you? Using threats to eliminate rivals? Well, it won’t work. And face it—with your stunted stature, Siqi would never favor you.”

“You dare!” Lin Chen jabbed a finger at him. “Mark my words: if you harass her further, I’ll expel you using Guan Yu’s Golden Scale authority. Beg then, and I’ll still send you packing.”

Ling Su paled, recalling Guan Yu’s authority. Forcing a smile, he backtracked, “Surely you wouldn’t ally with Guan Yu against me? Our pact was to oppose him together!”

“A pact you forgot the moment Siqi appeared,” Lin Chen scoffed. “Cease your antics, or lose her—and any hope of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique’s glory.”

**Chapter 4339: For the Sake of All**

“Very well,” Ling Su conceded, glancing at Siqi. “I’ll keep my distance… for now. But once we reach the desert, where retreat is impossible…”

“Then pester her all you like,” Lin Chen agreed. “But anger her now, and Sect Leader Dai’s wrath will fall on us both. Our mission is the Eight-Sided Drum Technique—secure it, and any reward from Master is ours.”

Ling Su nodded grudgingly. “True. My eagerness blinded me. That minx is irresistible.”

Lin Chen followed his gaze, silently acknowledging Siqi’s allure. Most men faltered in her presence—only fear of reprisal from him and Ling Su kept others at bay.

As acting deputy leader, Lin Chen sought to cement his authority, marginalizing Guan Yu. Ling Su’s recklessness nearly ruined this. Without Siqi, morale would crumble.

Guan Yu observed their tense exchange, satisfied his manipulation had taken root. Progress would be gradual, but the rift was undeniable.

Siqi, though vexed, endured for Guan Yu’s sake. To her, his actions were infallible, his needs paramount.

Resuming their journey, Ling Su notably avoided Siqi, strategizing with Lin Chen instead. As dusk approached, Guan Yu urged lodging in Beili Town—a familiar, agrarian settlement lacking grandeur.

Lin Chen, however, insisted on superior accommodations, leveraging his control over funds to rally the group. “Comfort is essential for our mission’s success!”

Guan Yu acquiesced publicly, affirming Lin Chen’s authority while subtly reminding all of their primary objective.

At the town’s largest inn, limited rooms forced pairing. Ling Su seized the chance, propositioning Siqi with oily concern: “A lady needs protection. Allow me to share your room.”

Siqi arched a brow. “Your prowess scarcely surpasses mine. Guard my door if you wish to serve.”

Guan Yu marveled at her uncharacteristic retort—more akin to the spirited Wang Xiaorong than her usual reticence.

Lin Chen chuckled. “An excellent suggestion, Ling Su. Vigilance indeed requires proximity.”

Deflated, Ling Su retreated. “Exhaustion weighs on me. Perhaps rest is wiser.”

**Chapter 4340: Compromise**

As pairings formed, four disciples, Guan Yu, Siqi, Ling Su, and Lin Chen remained unpartnered. Ling Su’s thwarted ambition simmered, while Lin Chen plotted his own approach.

Guan Yu addressed the group: “Understand this hardship. We’d press onward if not for necessity. Eleven rooms for twenty-two—pair wisely.”

Wang Jun and Aze stepped forward promptly, others hesitating. Ling Su’s gaze lingered on Siqi, schemes churning.

Lin Chen intervened. “Choose your pairs. Those remaining will be assigned.”

Yet when the reluctant clustered, Ling Su saw opportunity. “Siqi, danger lurks at night. Let me safeguard you.”

“Your protection?” Siqi replied coolly. “Station yourself outside my door. That would suffice.”

Guan Yu masked surprise. Siqi’s icy wit, though rare, cut deftly.

Lin Chen smirked. “A prudent solution, Ling Su. Vigilance from the threshold honors your concern.”

Ling Su scowled. “Fatigue claims me. Rest is paramount.”

Thus the game continued—alliances shifting, desires cloaked, and the desert’s promise looming.
