“Hmph, Guan Yu, I think you’re scared, aren’t you?” Sister Dao said disdainfully.

“I, Guan Yu, never rise early without profit. How about this—if I win, teacher, you’ll let me kiss you. Then I’ll agree to compete.”

“You!” Sister Dao stamped her foot angrily. Her gaze involuntarily shifted to Brother Xiong, who had long harbored secret feelings for her. He immediately understood her silent plea.

“Shall I compete with you instead?” A towering man removed his shirt and stepped out from behind Sister Dao. He tilted his neck, the joints of his hands cracking loudly. His pectoral muscles appeared larger than Sister Dao’s breasts, and a sinister smile played on his lips as he addressed Guan Yu with ill intent.

This was Brother Xiong—the male combat instructor!

As he passed Sister Dao, Brother Xiong deliberately flexed his chest muscles. He shielded her behind him with one arm while adopting a combat stance with the other, resembling a mountain poised to avalanche.

“Let me teach this ignorant brat a proper lesson.”

Hmph, playing the hero to save the beauty?

“What’s wrong, kid? Scared?” Brother Xiong taunted Guan Yu again.

Guan Yu inwardly scoffed. If I feared anything, it’d be accidentally injuring you! But wanting to avoid escalation, he smiled and shook his head. “Yes, I’m scared.”

Brother Xiong froze, completely unprepared for this response.

Yet seeing Sister Dao trembling with rage reignited the fire in Brother Xiong’s heart.

“Brat, let this teacher show you what real combat is.”

The room fell silent as spectators retreated several steps.

“Whoosh!”

Brother Xiong launched a ferocious punch with astonishing speed. Several timid girls covered their eyes in fright.

Though possessing supernatural abilities and cultivation, Guan Yu had no intention of prolonging the fight. These superficial strikes couldn’t harm him anyway. Letting Brother Xiong land a few blows to save face before Sister Dao might prevent future trouble in combat class.

Instead of dodging, Guan Yu stepped forward. The punch’s force, largely neutralized by his protective qi, appeared devastating to onlookers but felt like striking cotton to Brother Xiong.

“Ah!” Sister Dao cried out. “Stop!” She only wanted to discipline Guan Yu, not kill him!

When the punch landed, Brother Xiong stared at his fist in disbelief. Guan Yu pretended to wipe “blood” from his mouth and grinned. “Enough, teacher. You’ve taught your lesson—can you release me now?”

Recovering his senses, Brother Xiong’s face twisted with confusion, fear, and malice. Before rational thought returned, his eyes reddened with madness. He lifted Guan Yu horizontally and kneed his abdomen violently. Though protected by qi, the brutal scene horrified spectators.

Before Guan Yu could rise, an elbow strike slammed him back down. As he lay motionless, sudden pain exploded on his left cheek—Brother Xiong had stomped on his face!

“Brother Xiong! What are you doing? Release him!” Sister Dao intervened, unable to watch a student endure this.

“Hmph! This brat’s mouth needs discipline. Unless he surrenders now, I’ll teach him thoroughly!” Brother Xiong ground his foot, causing genuine pain as Guan Yu’s cheek deformed.

Zhou Xiaoyou rushed forward, tears streaming as she tugged Brother Xiong’s arm. “Teacher, let him go!”

Rage ignited in Guan Yu’s heart. This man dared make the woman he loved cry!

Unmoved and oblivious to Guan Yu’s growing fury, Brother Xiong sneered. “Know your place, trash. From now on, you’ll only call yourself ‘worthless.’ If you want mercy, swear to it!”

Sister Dao urged desperately, “Guan Yu, just yield!”

Though fury raged within, Guan Yu maintained his playful grin. “Sister Dao, are you worried about me?”

Stamping her foot, she pleaded, “Yes! What will make you yield?” Unexpected admiration stirred in her heart at his unyielding spirit.

Guan Yu quipped, “A kiss from you would do.”

“What?”

The crowd doubted their ears.

As Brother Xiong roared “Seeking death!”, tremendous force erupted beneath his feet. Guan Yu, hands hanging like a meditating monk, leapt up in an odd posture. Brother Xiong crashed to the floor.

Enraged, Brother Xiong charged again like a mad bear. Guan Yu smirked. “Is this all you’ve got? Charging blindly like a beast?”

Snickers rippled through the crowd.

Eyes blazing, Brother Xiong leapt with a spinning kick carrying devastating force.

“Watch out!” Zhou Xiaoyou cried.

Guan Yu stood calmly, not bothering to dodge. “Flashy moves.” Before the words faded, he caught Brother Xiong’s legs. Without using qi or special abilities, his hands flowed like water, dispersing all momentum. As Brother Xiong collapsed, Guan Yu ghost-flashed behind him.

“Boo!” Guan Yu shouted in his ear, startling him.

Brother Xiong whirled around—but Guan Yu had already reappeared behind him, tapping his shoulder. “Hey, look here.”

Instinctively turning, Brother Xiong met a fist-sized punch. Stars exploded in his vision as he staggered and collapsed.

**Chapter 1127: Exorcism Technique**

“Guan Yu! You dare mock me!” Brother Xiong lay groaning on the floor, face contorted.

“Mocking’s just the start!” Before anyone reacted, Guan Yu pounced, raining flesh-smacking punches. Though restraining his strength, three blows rendered Brother Xiong unconscious.

Knowing further strikes might kill, Guan Yu stood and coldly declared, “Challenge me again after weighing your worth. From now on, walk around me.”

His icy demeanor contrasted sharply with earlier frivolity. Sister Dao stared, uncertain which persona was real.

After class, Guan Yu ignored his earlier kissing claim, simply taking Zhou Xiaoyou’s hand to leave.

“Guan Yu, wait!” Sister Dao called, but he didn’t pause. Watching them depart, she felt inexplicable sorrow and anger.

Outside, Zhou Xiaoyou whispered tearfully, “I was so worried earlier.”

Guan Yu softened. “Worried I’d lose?”

“No. You’re strongest in my heart. But I can’t bear seeing you humiliated.”

Guan Yu solemnly vowed, “I promise never to worry you again.”

Zhou Xiaoyou hugged him tightly before releasing.

That night, they cultivated at the back mountain. Guan Yu strove toward Golden Core stage—the Dharma Assembly approached in three months.

Post-midnight, after routine meditation, only Wild Crane Daoist, Feng Qingyang, and Liao Yuntian remained.

Guan Yu recounted the day’s events.

Hearing of Brother Xiong, Wild Crane Daoist fanned himself thoughtfully. “Disciplining fools is acceptable, but avoid unnecessary conflicts. Though Headmaster Wan will handle this.”

Guan Yu nodded. He hadn’t planned escalation, but inexplicable fury had overwhelmed him—a sign of imperfect cultivation.

“No matter. More concerning is Wang Xiaojun’s background.”

Wang Xiaojun emitted immortal energy—likely Golden Core stage. The Heavy Sword Sect lived up to its reputation.

“His sudden appearance at Linchuan University isn’t coincidental.”

Wild Crane and Feng Qingyang exchanged glances. “We know little of Heavy Sword Sect. Perhaps Liao Yuntian knows more.”

As Dragon Pride’s disciple and Dragon Group member, Liao Yuntian understood major sects.

The silent Liao Yuntian finally spoke. “Wang Xiaojun is Master Ziyin’s disciple—rumored reincarnation of Lü Dongbin. He cultivates uniquely.”

Guan Yu raised eyebrows. “How?”

“He cultivates Heaven.”

Ambitious indeed! “Discover why he came here. Why challenge me?”

“Invite him for discussion.”

“Tomorrow noon in Headmaster Wan’s office. Liao Yuntian, bring him.”

The group dispersed. Strangely energized post-cultivation, Guan Yu felt no fatigue.

Next day, during class, Wang Xiaojun eyed Guan Yu hesitantly. Guan Yu ignored him—if matters arose, Wang would approach.

Mid-lecture, Guan Yu grew restless. Spotting Sister Dao at the door, their eyes met—hers conflicted. She vanished when he blinked.

Suddenly, screams erupted. A convulsing boy foamed at the mouth, black mist coiling on his face.

“Epilepsy!” Bao exclaimed, moving to restrain him.

Wang Xiaojun yanked Bao back. “Don’t touch! Not illness—demon possession!”

Few understood, but Guan Yu recognized cultivation matters. The black mist formed an inverted cross—identical to A’fa’s mark!

Wang Xiaojun pressed acupoints, calming the victim.

Impressed, Guan Yu noted Wang’s unadorned movements mirroring his blunt sword. Demon activity suggested dark cultivators—like that illusionist.

“Inform Wild Crane,” Guan Yu told Zhou Xiaoyou and Bao.

Alone with Wang Xiaojun, Guan Yu asked bluntly, “Was that exorcism?”

“Nine Seals technique. Not exorcism—strengthens the possessed.”

Unfamiliar with cultivation lore, Guan Yu requested elaboration.

Eagerly, Wang explained in an empty classroom: “The Nine Seals correspond to ‘臨兵鬥者皆陣列在前’ mantra. Though basic, they birth infinite variations.”

Demonstrating, Wang’s hands flowed through forms—lightning strikes, bamboo shoots, mountain steadiness. Guan Yu mastered them swiftly.

“Why help me?” Guan Yu probed.

The door burst open. Zhou Xiaoyou entered with Wild Crane Daoist.

“So you’re Lü Zu’s reincarnation!” Wild Crane exclaimed.

Wang blushed. “Master mentioned you’d assist me.”

Wild Crane and Guan Yu exchanged glances. Why would Heavy Sword Sect’s Master Ziyin need help?

**Chapter 1128: Nine Seals**

Liao Yuntian explained Wang’s background as Heavy Sword Sect’s rising star. Discussions deepened until nightfall, Guan Yu’s cultivation progressing remarkably.

At dawn, campus life resumed. During class, Wang Xiaojun’s lingering gaze hinted at unspoken words. Guan Yu waited patiently.

When black-misted convulsions recurred days later, Guan Yu’s hands instinctively formed Nine Seals. Energy surged—the path ahead promised storms, but Guan Yu stood ready.
