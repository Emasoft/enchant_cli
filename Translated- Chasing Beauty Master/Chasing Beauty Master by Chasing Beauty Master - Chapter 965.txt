“Let her do as she pleases.” Guan Yu nodded. Wei Hongwei arrived with Yaoyao, who immediately went to chat with Lü Mei.

Wei Hongwei and Guan Yu sat on the sofa chatting. Wei marveled incessantly at Guan Yu’s lifestyle. “Boss, this villa of yours is incredible! The living room alone is three times the size of mine. Living in such luxury—truly enviable.”

“You’ve been here before. Why the sudden awe?” Guan Yu remarked.

Wei’s face crumpled into a pitiful expression. “Boss, you don’t know how stingy my dad is. He bought me an apartment in the south district as a wedding gift. I was thrilled at first, but when I saw it—barely over a hundred square meters! Isn’t that miserly to the extreme…?”

“A hundred square meters isn’t small! Some families live in spaces half that size. Count your blessings,” Guan Yu advised kindly.

“How can I be content? My dad’s own place is over two hundred square meters! I’m his only son—my wedding home should be bigger and lavishly decorated. It’s only right!” Wei declared matter-of-factly.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Your father isn’t the God of Wealth. You should consider what he can afford. Besides, a hundred square meters is plenty for a young couple. Take Jia Bo’s family—they might not even afford a house by the time he marries. Property prices are astronomical now, especially in the south district. Having a place there is already fortunate. Be grateful.”

Wei pondered this and conceded Guan Yu had a point. Compared to Jia Bo, he was far better off. Crunching into a juicy apple, Wei complained, “Boss, you don’t know—my dad’s a gambling addict. The money he’s lost at mahjong could’ve bought me a whole building!”

“Contentment brings happiness,” Guan Yu said, changing the subject. “How’s the cafeteria situation?”

“Not sure. I avoid mentioning it around Yaoyao and don’t usually check. Today’s lunch was meant to treat you and Lü Mei, but she seems unavailable now.” Wei grinned.

“Men obsessed with games are bad enough, but women? Lü Mei’s utterly hooked.” Guan Yu shook his head ruefully, privately relieved Lü Mei wouldn’t join them. Protecting her in dangerous situations would be challenging now.

“Actually, today’s also Yaoyao’s birthday. My mom’s hosting dinner tonight. A day of feasting—heh!” Wei’s eyes lit up at the thought.

Guan Yu patted his shoulder. “Eat less. You’re ballooning up without exercise. Doesn’t Yaoyao mind your weight?”

“I want to slim down, but I can’t resist food! Yaoyao hasn’t complained, but I care about my image. Got any weight-loss tips, Boss?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Two methods: one fast, one slow. Which do you want?”

“The quick one! Spill it!”

“Come to Qiaoyuan District every morning. I’ll beat you up thoroughly. Guaranteed weight loss in half a month—a month max.”

“Are you messing with me?!” Wei protested. Getting daily beatings sounded masochistic. “What’s the slow method?”

“Come every other day. I’ll beat you up then too…” Guan Yu replied, chuckling.

Realizing he’d been tricked, Wei dared not argue. In his mind, Guan Yu could defeat him with a finger. “No real method then.” He finished his apple and grabbed an orange.

“The only real way is diet and exercise—consistently. Otherwise, forget losing weight.”

“Can’t do it. No willpower. Everyone knows diet and exercise work, but who sticks to it? Not me.”

“At least Yaoyao doesn’t mind. If I were her, I’d order you to lose ten pounds monthly—or else breakup. That’d motivate you.”

“Thankfully you’re not her!” Wei laughed before shifting topics. “Boss, I heard you’ve been arresting gangsters and making enemies—all for some police beauty? Yaoyao jokes that wherever there’s a damsel in distress, Guan Yu appears!”

Guan Yu grimaced as Wei added, “Your reputation’s shifting from noble hero to ‘lady killer’.”

**Chapter 2468: Something Amiss**

“Don’t listen to rumors. That officer is Jingjing’s friend. She asked for help—I couldn’t refuse.”

Wei peeled a banana. Guan Yu felt full just watching. “Helping her caused trouble for our gang brothers. They’ve been attacked when alone.”

“Really?”

“Last night, a brother argued at a bar. Normally, mentioning Yu Gang gets respect. But this time, after he left, thugs ambushed him—broke his left leg.”

Guan Yu had anticipated backlash. “Tell Yaoyao and Jia Bo to stay vigilant. Ambushes are likely.”

“We’ve been staying in. Her brother’s transferring her to Kaifeng School. She’ll keep closer tabs on me.” Wei smirked.

“Smart move. Without supervision, you’d stray.” Guan Yu teased. “Heard about Wang Hu?”

Guan Yu vaguely recalled Wang Hu—a righteous cultivation fanatic. “He’s challenging big names, won three matches at Zhouyang High. Aims for taekwondo championship.”

“Him? Impossible.” Though Wang Hu specialized in defense, unfit for tournaments. “He’s Third-Class Adept Lower Tier. Many schools have Second-Class adepts.”

“Rumors say he’s improved rapidly. Beat Wei Yong badly recently—shield reflection injured him.”

Guan Yu frowned. Closed-door matches? Odd for seeking fame. “Monitor him. His strength benefits Yu Gang.”

**Chapter 2469: Grant Me This Honor**

As Xue Jing approached, Wei fawned, “Elder Sister-in-law grows more beautiful! Boss treats you well.”

Xue Jing wore simple white and light jeans, accentuating her fair complexion. Flattered, she offered more fruit.

“No thanks. Boss wants me slim. Saving appetite for dinner!” Wei declined.

“Help yourself to anything,” Xue Jing said warmly.

Yaoyao descended, overhearing. “Admiring other women? Want someone like her?”

Wei panicked. “J-just joking! You’re the best!”

“Better not dare.” Yaoyao turned sweetly. “Let’s eat together. It’s been ages.”

At McDonald’s, they ate casually. After parting, Guan Yu and Xue Jing headed to buy snacks when tattooed men surrounded them.

“Guan Yu, our boss requests your presence. Grant us this honor,” said a bare-chested man with a dragon tattoo.

“Who’s your boss?”

“You’ll see. No harm intended—just talk.”

Xue Jing tensed, but Guan Yu agreed. “Lead the way.”

In the car, he reassured her, “Small fries. They need lecturing—our brothers suffer ambushes.”

He called Jia Bo to arrange backup, determined to end these covert attacks.
