“The truly formidable one isn’t him, but that middle-aged man standing over there. If I’m not mistaken, his status within the War Wolf Mercenary Corps must be quite high.”

Upon hearing Bika Cat’s words, Guan Yu shifted his gaze to the middle-aged man. Thick-browed with a square jaw, the man exuded authority without overt intimidation. Though distant, Guan Yu sensed the formidable aura radiating from him.

“His cultivation is at least at the Archmage level. I can’t precisely gauge his strength, which means he’s likely above us,” Guan Yu remarked calmly.

“Haha, this is exhilarating! I’ve always wanted to test my limits. Seems like today’s the day!”

“Cough… Are you insane? How can you laugh at a time like this? We’ve only got one life to lose!” Guan Yu shot Bika Cat a sidelong glance, though inwardly amused. This damned cat was becoming more like him by the day.

“How could we die? With you protecting me, I’ll live a thousand years!”

“Enough chatter. When the real fight starts, no slacking. Prepare for a brutal battle ahead.”

“Understood! But there’s something I still don’t get—did you notice the people flanking that middle-aged man?”

Guan Yu glanced again and saw a man and woman on either side of the figure—both familiar faces!

“Wolfbane Flower? She’s here too! Why hasn’t the War Wolf Mercenary Corps shown any sign of reconciliation? Did she break her promise after returning?”

“Boss, maybe she tried but wasn’t heeded. Let’s deal with this troublemaker first, then question her.”

“Good. Stay here while I confront him. If he threatens Xiaowei’s group, I’ll engage him. When he’s distracted, rescue them.”

Bika Cat nodded. Guan Yu leaped forward, landing before Lang Tianming and approaching steadily.

“Hey! Who are you?” Lang Tianming barked, tightening his guard as Guan Yu advanced.

“Deaf? Can’t hear me? Stop right there!”

As Guan Yu drew closer, Lang Tianming’s agitation grew. “One more step and I’ll kill them!” He abruptly raised Xiaowei’s group thirty meters into the air—a fatal height if they fell.

Guan Yu paused momentarily, halting his steps.

“Hahaha! Scared, coward? You dare challenge me?”

To everyone’s shock, Guan Yu resumed advancing. Lang Tianming paled—most of his energy was channeled into maintaining the levitation spell. If attacked now, he’d be defenseless.

“You madman! Don’t you care if they die?”

At Lang Tianming’s roar, Guan Yu vanished in a teleportation flash.

“Show yourself, bastard! Fight openly or I’ll devour you!” Lang Tianming spun wildly, searching the empty air as hundreds watched intently.

“Where’d the Dragon Cat Hero go?”

“He’s hiding! The ambush is coming!”

“I’ll bet ten gold coins he doesn’t return!”

“You’re on!”

As the wager concluded, Guan Yu materialized above Lang Tianming like a falling blade. The mercenary leader barely retracted his energy from Xiaowei’s group to counterattack.

Clashing fists and palms erupted with metallic clangs, their blows infused with inner energy and magic. Meanwhile, Bika Cat sprang into action per Guan Yu’s plan.

Xiaowei closed his eyes during the freefall. “Goodbye… This is my fate.”

Yet instead of impact, a cushioning updraft cradled him and the armored guards downward. “What’s happening?” the guard captain asked mid-descent.

“Heaven pities us,” Xiaowei murmured as they landed safely. Though mystified, their survival eclipsed curiosity.

“We can’t match these wolfmen. Let’s retreat—Lord Guan Yu will handle this.”

Xiaowei glanced at the distant battle. “Though I want to help, I’d only burden him. His valor alone saved us.”

“No Steel Guard forgets debts,” the captain vowed. “A hero like him, aiding our barren town without reward—we’ll sing his praises far and wide!”

As combat intensified, Guan Yu gradually gained the upper hand. Lang Tianming, shocked his hostages survived, redoubled ferocious attacks.

After several exchanges, Guan Yu unleashed an Earth-tier skill—Violet Blade Manifestation. Lang Tianming barely dodged the purple arc. “You’ve mastered this long ago!” he growled, reassessing his opponent.

Perching on a rooftop, Lang Tianming demanded, “Why attack without a word?”

“Must I request permission? ‘Greetings, may I duel you?’”

Snorting, Lang Tianming pressed, “At least name yourself before I kill you.”

“Your grandfather is Guan Yu. You’ve heard of me.”

“So it’s true! Eighth Brother said you had skill, but you’re no match for our Second or Third Brothers!”

“Your ranking goes by strength? You’re Ninth?”

“Tenth! Ninth beat me once by luck!” Lang Tianming’s face twisted with resentment.

“Excuses prove weakness,” Guan Yu taunted.

“Insolent pup! I’ll crush you with full power!”

“Oh? You’ve been holding back?”

Instead of intimidation, Guan Yu’s mockery intrigued the mercenary. “Your defiance reminds me of my youth. I like it!”

“Spare me—I don’t fancy men.”

Lang Tianming’s laughter boomed unexpectedly before he sobered. “You’re no wasteland native. Why defend this dump? Name your price.”

“Tempting, but I dislike chains.”

“You reject joining War Wolf’s elite? Fool!”

As Lang Tianming lunged, a shadow intervened—the middle-aged observer now radiating overwhelming aura.

“Tenth Brother, restrain yourself.”

“Second Brother!” Lang Tianming deferred immediately.

The newcomer studied Guan Yu. “So you’re the famed Guan Yu.”

“The one and only.”

“Impudent youth. Know that in my eyes, such bravado is childish.”

“Then you’ve grown old.”

“How dare you!” Lang Tianming bristled, but the elder waved him off.

“Perhaps. But unpolished stones get swept away by torrents. Modesty serves the young.”

“Or they journey beyond narrow streams,” Guan Yu countered.

The man chuckled. “A novel perspective. I am Lang Tianhun, Second-in-Command of War Wolf Mercenary Corps.”

Gasps rippled through onlookers. Lang Tianhun—one of two Archmages in the corps—could reshape battlefields single-handedly. Yet Guan Yu stood unfazed before the living legend.
