Several days later, military personnel returned to the Ouyang residence bearing thunderous news for Ouyang Zhengdong: Their investigation revealed the client commissioning those weapons was an Eastern Islands corporation operating in Huaxia. All twelve produced weapons had reached the Eastern Islands, with three Huaxia mutants already reverted to ordinary humans by their effects.

The Ouyang family had manufactured only twelve units before all products, blueprints, machinery, and tools were confiscated and destroyed. Replication became impossible. Ouyang Zhengdong collapsed upon hearing this, realizing their family had committed an earth-shattering blunder. If the Eastern Islands truly weaponized this technology to neutralize global superhumans, their rise as the world's dominant power would be inevitable.

The military issued a fifteen-day ultimatum: Either produce over twelve weapons with their accompanying radiation beams, or face treason charges.

Manufacturing more weapons proved impossible without specifications. Even understanding the mysterious "radiation beams" required years of research. The Ouyang family's doom seemed sealed—until an unexpected visitor arrived.

A man named Yu Zhengchun (Upright Spring), a fifty-something mutant with three-day regenerative invisibility powers, proposed salvation through marriage to Ouyang Yihan. He claimed he could infiltrate Eastern Islands facilities to steal or destroy the weapons.

Despite his abilities, Yu's wizened appearance—sallow complexion, scraggly yellow beard, and criminal history—repelled Ouyang Zhengdong. How could he sacrifice his beautiful, American-educated daughter to this decrepit thief? The patriarch refused.

Three days later, the military returned demanding answers. Cornered, Ouyang Zhengdong admitted their manufacturing incapacity. The officers counteroffered: Destroy the existing weapons to avoid prosecution.

Suspecting Yu's collusion with authorities, Ouyang Zhengdong reluctantly prepared to accept both demands. But Ouyang Yihan rebelled, fleeing her family's estate and encountering Guanyu.

Initially indifferent to the runaway heiress' marital woes, Guanyu's interest sparked upon learning the Eastern Islands' anti-mutant weapons originated from Ouyang factories.

"Why commission your family?" Guanyu questioned. "Their domestic industries surpass yours."

Ouyang Yihan explained their patented photon-capturing technology—devices self-destructing upon disassembly. The Eastern Islands shouldn't have replicated their systems, yet somehow weaponized them against mutants.

Guanyu smirked. "This Yu Zhengchun is a mutant. Why seek my help?"

The heiress' eyes glittered. "Last night I merely sought solace in drink. Today, I discovered hope. You're the miracle-worker emerging from the African relic—the one who defies gravity!"

Guanyu tensed. His recent exit from the dimensional rift had indeed drawn attention. Liu Shilei, his long-lost love, worried about renewed Dragon Group involvement. Meanwhile, hanger-on Hou Jinshun gaped in awe, envisioning immortal mentors.

Ouyang Yihan pressed her advantage. "Our military contacts confirmed it—a Chinese man with godlike powers exited the relic. Liu Shilei's vanished lover shared your name. Coincidence?"

Unable to deny, Guanyu demanded terms. "Assume I help. What can your family offer?"

"Anything!" Ouyang Yihan gestured flamboyantly. "Even myself as concubine, if Sister Shilei permits!"

Liu Shilei rolled her eyes while Guanyu negotiated an evening meeting with Ouyang Zhengdong at Pearl Hotel.

Later, at Sun Xiaoya's home, domestic chaos ensued. The mentally unstable Mrs. Sun hailed Guanyu as "son-in-law," mortifying her daughter before Principal Liu.

"Just play along," Guanyu whispered as Liu Shilei pinched his arm. "Her mother's illness..."

Dinner became a three-woman farce—flustered teacher, jealous principal, and delusional matchmaker—until conversation turned serious.

"Your mother needs proper treatment," Guanyu stated. Under Mrs. Sun's expectant gaze, golden light emanated from his palm, suffusing her body with healing energy.

Coughing black phlegm, the woman's eyes cleared. "Xiaoya... I remember now. The car accident... your father..."

As mother and daughter embraced, Liu Shilei marveled. Twenty years in the relic hadn't just preserved Guanyu's youth—it forged him into something beyond human.
