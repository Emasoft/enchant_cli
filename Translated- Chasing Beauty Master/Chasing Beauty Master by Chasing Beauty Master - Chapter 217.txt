Almost simultaneously, the three gunmen cried out in pain. Their firearms clattered to the ground as their wrists throbbed, entire arms turning purplish-black. Though invisible in the darkness, they could feel their bodies undergoing horrifying changes.

First came complete numbness in their hands, then paralysis spreading through half their bodies. Within less than a minute, all movement was lost. They collapsed convulsing, white foam bubbling from their mouths.

This carnage belonged to the venomous scorpion – its toxin surpassed even the deadliest serpent's bite. Guan Yu's eyes glinted with murderous intent as he commanded his swarm of venomous insects to engulf the three fallen men. Their agonized screams soon dwindled to whimpers, their final moments far more gruesome than the snipers' earlier demise.

Without sparing them a glance, Guan Yu sprinted toward the factory's sole flickering light. Ten minutes wasted – five remained before detonation.

Chapter 539: Disarming the Bomb

In the small workshop, Li Xi sat gagged with duct tape. Five gunmen positioned themselves strategically – two flanking the door, two facing it directly, while Flamehair crouched behind Li Xi's chair, ready for ambush. Tension crackled through the stagnant air as they awaited Guan Yu's assault.

Flamehair's trembling hand clutched his pistol. The bloodcurdling screams outside defied comprehension – how could one man eliminate two snipers and three gunmen so swiftly? Unless... No, their surveillance confirmed Guan Yu acted alone. The realization chilled his marrow.

With shaking fingers, Flamehair activated the bomb's timer – truthfully set for five minutes now. Previous claims of thirty minutes had been deception to lure Guan Yu. Their true target wasn't Li Xi's death, but trapping both in explosive embrace.

As seconds crawled, the workshop door creaked open. Not human intruders, but a green serpent slithered through the gap. Gunfire erupted as more snakes poured in – a writhing tsunami bypassing Li Xi's vicinity. Chaos ensued as fangs found flesh.

Seizing the distraction, Guan Yu blurred through the doorway. Four precise shots dropped the remaining gunmen. He materialized before Li Xi, staring at the bomb's countdown: 01:00.

"I've never disarmed a bomb before," Guan Yu stated grimly, sweat beading his brow as he exposed red, yellow, and blue wires beneath the casing. The timer ticked...20...19...10...

At 05 seconds, enlightenment struck. His scanning ability revealed the cruel trick – all three wires must be severed simultaneously. With 01 second remaining, the display froze.

Chapter 540: Unforeseen Peril

Guan Yu collapsed against the wall, trembling. One second slower would have ended everything. Three near-death encounters today had tested even his enhanced abilities. Behind him, Li Xi sat pale and shaken, her rapid breaths making the bomb's casing tremble against her chest.

Working methodically, Guan Yu activated gravity manipulation as he removed the device. His fingers froze mid-motion – subtle pressure shift. Without hesitation, he hurled the bomb through the window.

BOOM!

The shockwave powdered glass as flames engulfed the night. Shrapnel peppered Guan Yu's back when he shielded Li Xi. Bloodied but resolute, he carried her from the collapsing factory.

Miles away, Flamehair leaned against a black sedan, filming the inferno. "Boss's trap worked perfectly," he chuckled, imagining rewards awaiting. The enhanced thermobaric device left no survival possible – or so he believed.

Chapter 542: Wan Qianshan's Scheme

As Guan Yu drove through moonlit wilderness, his body throbbed with fresh wounds. Li Xi sat stiffly in back, silk scarf barely concealing her disheveled state. Their eyes met briefly in the rearview mirror – hers sharp with unspoken questions, his hastily averted.

"Shouldn't we...discuss what happened?" Li Xi finally broke the silence, cheeks flushing as she adjusted her makeshift covering.

Guan Yu grinned through split lips. "Right now, I'm more concerned about the glass shards in my—"

The car swerved violently as something massive crashed onto the road ahead. Before them stood Wan Qianshan's elite enforcers, their modified vehicles blocking escape. Moonlight glinted off cybernetic armaments as the true architect of this night's horrors finally revealed his hand.
