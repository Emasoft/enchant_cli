After several repetitions of stretching exercises, the young boy felt his muscles and bones were sufficiently loosened. He began doing push-ups in the courtyard. Despite his tender age, he could effortlessly perform thirty or forty in one breath—a capability honed through years of herb-gathering expeditions in the mountains for his grandfather since early childhood.

The mention of mountain herb-gathering immediately conjured a mental obstacle for Guan Yu—the formidable mountain range called Fierce Tiger Mountain. Legends spoke of numerous ferocious beasts inhabiting those peaks, the most fearsome being tigers.

These were no ordinary tigers, but magical creatures called Saber-Toothed Tigers. Adult Saber-Toothed Tigers ranked as Profound-Level magical beasts, equivalent to human Senior Mages or higher. Even juvenile specimens surpassed Junior Mages in power.

For this reason, villagers of Chen Family Village dared not venture lightly onto Fierce Tiger Mountain. Though aware of its abundant rare resources, they valued their lives above potential gains.

Occasionally, bold souls from the village—those with some magical cultivation or youthful vigor—would attempt expeditions. Tragically, none ever returned.

Thereafter, Fierce Tiger Mountain's dread hold over villagers intensified. Many vowed never to approach those accursed slopes, preferring lifelong isolation to certain death.

Thus Fierce Tiger Mountain became taboo in Chen Family Village conversations.

While aware of these tales, Guan Yu didn't share the villagers' fear. A child's curiosity about nature outweighed his trepidation. Moreover, his grandfather's chronic illness motivated him—if he could reach those forbidden peaks, he might find more potent medicines.

The specific herb he sought was Fire Lingzhi. Once found in smaller mountains, it had been overharvested to extinction elsewhere. Now only Fierce Tiger Mountain might harbor this precious fungus.

This realization stirred restless determination in Guan Yu's heart.

"I must study magic earnestly! When I become a Junior Mage, I'll gather herbs for Grandfather!"

Clenching small fists, the boy declared this vow aloud.

A sudden bout of violent coughing interrupted his thoughts—Grandfather had awakened again.

Guan Yu nimbly dropped from the tree he'd been perched on and rushed to the elderly man's side. "Grandfather, you shouldn't be up so early while unwell! Return to bed—I'll prepare breakfast soon!"

Chen Renzhe (Benevolent Zeal) chuckled at his grandson's concerned face. "Little one, it's already late! In my youth, I rose before five for training. Look—it's past six!"

Checking the time, Guan Yu grinned sheepishly. "So you were that diligent? I'll surpass you—rising even earlier!"

The old man's laughter deepened. "Such spirit pleases me, but remember—early rising alone won't suffice. Magic cultivation depends foremost on affinity!"

"Affinity? What's that? How do I know if I have it?"

Before Guan Yu could finish questioning, a fist-sized crystal materialized in Chen Renzhe's palm—translucent and glittering.

"Grandfather! What's that beautiful thing? May I touch it?"

Without hesitation, Chen Renzhe handed over the orb. The moment Guan Yu's fingers made contact, his body convulsed as if electrocuted. A searing, crawling sensation—like millions of ants burrowing through his palm—engulfed him in agony.

"Grandfather! What's happening? This orb is terrifying!"

Chen Renzhe remained silent, eyes fixed on the crystal. The formerly clear sphere now pulsed with faint azure light that deepened steadily.

Witnessing this, the old man closed his eyes, emotions surging like tidal waves. "Just as I suspected... A once-in-a-millennium genius!"

He glanced at Guan Yu's tortured expression and waved a hand. With a resonant boom, ethereal vapor dissipated from the crystal, restoring its transparency and ending the boy's suffering.

"Why did the pain stop suddenly?" Guan Yu examined his unmarked palm in confusion.

"That agony was an illusion—your consciousness undergoing affinity testing while projecting physical feedback. No actual harm occurred."

Though not fully comprehending, Guan Yu grasped the essential reassurance. "I see. Then... what were the results? You looked shocked—am I hopeless? Should I abandon magic?"

"Foolish boy! Where's your confidence?" Chen Renzhe's stern expression melted upon seeing Guan Yu's downcast face. The child murmured, "I truly want to learn magic... become a great mage... But training costs money... I'd rather spend it on your medicine..."

Chen Renzhe's sternness dissolved into tenderness. "Silly child, leave finances to me. Your duty is cultivation! Now hear your test results—"

Guan Yu's ears perked up attentively.

"They say talent is one in a hundred, genius one in ten thousand. You're one in a million!"

"What? A million?!"

Disbelief warred with elation in Guan Yu's heart. The magical arts that once seemed unattainable now felt within reach. "Truly, Grandfather? I'm... a genius?"

"Have I ever deceived you?" Chen Renzhe smiled, though inwardly conflicted—should such praise foster arrogance? Yet withholding might crush motivation. Resolving to guide carefully, he began formulating training plans.

...

In their humble courtyard that afternoon, Guan Yu mirrored Chen Renzhe's movements with earnest imprecision. Though clumsy, his attempts showed promise.

"Grandfather, why repeat this single technique all afternoon?"

Chen Renzhe glared. "No complaints during training! Question the method, not the pace. My instructions exist for your benefit!"

Guan Yu nodded. Since beginning magical instruction, his grandfather had grown stern—a necessary rigor the boy intuitively understood. Pampering wouldn't forge a true mage.

"I'll ask no more foolish questions. Let's continue!"

Chen Renzhe nodded approval. Guan Yu's flaws would smooth with practice—what took him a month to master as youth, this prodigy might grasp in days.

"We'll rest now. Remember—cultivation requires balance. Practice without reflection breeds confusion; theory without action breeds sloth."

Wiping sweat with his sleeve, Guan Yu fetched water for his grandfather. "Drink first. I'll meditate on this technique."

"Ponder well," Chen Renzhe smiled. "Magic becomes simple when passion drives learning. Forced study rarely yields mastery."

Guan Yu's heart leapt—magic's allure had already ensnared him completely.

As he turned to contemplate indoors, a voice called outside: "Guan Yu! What are you doing home?"

A boy twice Guan Yu's girth—Chen Xiaohu (Little Tiger)—panted at their gate. Though two years older, Xiaohu shared Guan Yu's status as village outcast—his obesity and Guan Yu's frailty making them mutual targets.

"I... wasn't doing anything!" Guan Yu caught himself, remembering his grandfather's warning about secrecy.

"Let's gather herbs! Mother's leg pains returned!"

Guan Yu nodded eagerly—three days had passed since his last harvest. Grandfather's medicinal stock needed replenishing.

After fetching sickle and basket, the boys departed. "What were you gesturing at earlier?" Xiaohu asked.

"Oh... just imagining being a grand mage!" Guan Yu deflected.

Xiaohu guffawed. "You? A mage? Without money or teacher?"

"You'll see!" Guan Yu's cryptic smile hid private resolve.

Their bond sustained both through constant bullying—Xiaohu's weight and Guan Yu's foreign origins marking them as misfits.

"Where to harvest? Nearby hills are stripped bare. Xiaoyong's gang took everything yesterday!"

Guan Yu surveyed denuded slopes, gaze drifting toward distant peaks behind smaller hills. "Heaven won't abandon us..."

Noticing his friend's fixation, Xiaohu paled. "You don't mean... Fierce Tiger Mountain? The beast-infested—"

Guan Yu's finger pressed to lips silenced him. "Swear secrecy!"

At Xiaohu's nervous nod, Guan Yu whispered, "Those untouched heights must hold treasures!"

"Madness! Those monsters eat people!"

Yet desperation outweighed fear. Guan Yu's mother had succumbed to the same mysterious illness plaguing old Liu Yishou's wife—maladies villagers attributed to cosmic malice. When torch-bearing mobs had stormed Liu's home years prior, the old man's calm demeanor amidst chaos still haunted Guan Yu.

"Demon-spawn! Leave Riverside Manor!" the mob had roared, their hatred echoing through Guan Yu's memories.

Now history repeated—Guan Yu's very existence deemed cursed. Only through Xiaohu's friendship and Chen Renzhe's guidance did hope persist.

"Let the fools take these barren hills," Guan Yu declared, eyes blazing with mountain-born resolve. "True bounty lies beyond!"
