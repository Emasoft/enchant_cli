The detection system fed information into Guan Yu's mind, but it didn't specify the reason for the cub's critical condition. Unable to diagnose the root cause, Guan Yu could only resort to desperate measures, relying on energy generated by the treatment system to see if it could prolong the cub's life.

"Treatment System, activate!"

With a mental shout from Guan Yu, the soft blue light emitted by the copper coin in his mind intensified into a piercing azure glow. The treatment system operated at full capacity as streams of energy flowed through Guan Yu's hands into the cub's body.

Chirp... chirp...

Animals possess greater sensitivity to energy than humans. The moment energy entered its body, the cub began chirping joyfully, seemingly enamored with this nourishing power.

Through the pet system, Guan Yu sensed the cub's excitement and couldn't help smiling faintly. At least his efforts were having some effect.

Suddenly, an unexpected mutation occurred!

The therapeutic energy surged into the cub like floodwaters through a broken dam. The cub's body became a bottomless vortex, voraciously devouring Guan Yu's energy.

A wave of weakness overwhelmed Guan Yu. His face paled with alarm.

Was the cub fighting for survival... or trying to kill him? This reckless energy drain would suck him dry if continued!

He needed to stop immediately - otherwise the cub's rescue might cost his own life!

Before Guan Yu could withdraw his hands, an even fiercer suction erupted from the cub. Darkness engulfed his vision as he collapsed, losing consciousness. The copper coin's light faded completely.

Guan Yu awoke to crying. When he opened his eyes, his eyelids felt leaden, his body utterly drained of strength.

His energy reserves had been depleted again! He'd lost count how many times climbing this mountain had left him completely exhausted.

"Guan Yu! You're awake?"

When Guan Yu fully opened his eyes, he saw a tear-stained face etched with anxiety - pale and heart-wrenchingly fragile.

"How long was I out?" Guan Yu whispered hoarsely.

"Three days!" Gao Wei gripped his hands tightly, voice trembling.

Three days?

Guan Yu's mind reeled. He remembered attempting to heal the cub when the mutation occurred, the cub draining his energy until he collapsed. Now he'd slept for three days straight.

The thought chilled him. What was this strange cub?

High intelligence yet critically ill - was this nature's cruel irony?

"Guan Yu, I thought you..." Gao Wei's voice broke again as tears streamed down her face.

During Guan Yu's coma, Gao Wei had kept vigil, surviving only through the falcon's periodic food deliveries. The father bird had guarded them initially before hunting for its other chicks.

"Where's the cub?" Guan Yu asked suddenly.

Chirp!

As if summoned, the cub alighted on Guan Yu's chest.

"That's the cub?" Guan Yu gasped in disbelief.

Chapter 815: The Transformed Cub

Gao Wei nodded. "This is the cub you saved."

Guan Yu examined the transformed creature. Though similar in size, its physique had strengthened remarkably. Its once dull gray plumage now shimmered with obsidian hues, claws gleaming like polished ivory.

This metamorphosis astounded Guan Yu. The cub's drastic changes in three days defied nature. Clearly, the treatment system's energy had triggered an extraordinary evolution.

Chirping cheerfully, the cub nuzzled Guan Yu's cheek with affectionate familiarity.

"It seems bonded to you," Gao Wei observed. "After your collapse, it guarded this cave relentlessly, ignoring even its father."

Over days, Guan宇 observed the cub's ongoing transformations - physical enhancements suggesting either miraculous recovery or unstable mutation.

During recovery, he cautiously resumed treatments, careful to avoid another energy drain. The cub's intelligence proved remarkable, understanding commands and displaying human-like reactions.

"Let's hunt," Guan Yu提议 after regaining strength. "We need provisions."

Chapter 816: The Mysterious Cave

Meanwhile in N City...

Liu Shilei and four other women sat around untouched meals in Guan Yu's villa. The air hung heavy with grief - half a month without news of Guan Yu's whereabouts.

Tearful silence reigned until Feng Xin burst in with urgent news: "We've found him! In Mulan Mountain!"

The villa erupted into frantic activity. Family connections mobilized helicopters, resources converged on the search.

As N City's powers mobilized, Guan Yu himself remained blissfully unaware, hunting with Gao Wei and the transformed cub he'd named Xiao Hei. The intelligent raptor perched on his shoulder, assisting their woodland forays.

When encountering a large wolf guarding its kill, Guan Yu smirked. "Another wolf? Time to skin us a new rug."
