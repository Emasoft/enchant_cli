“You truly are skilled at comfort,” Xiaomei said deliberately, watching Siqi’s nervous expression with amusement. “The weather here is unpredictable—utterly unknowable. Let me tell you, in the desert, such storms either never come or arrive with peril when they do.”

Guanyu shot Xiaomei an exasperated glance. While he had been tirelessly soothing Siqi, this woman had chosen to stoke her fears instead—clearly intent on contradicting him.

“Having lived in the desert for years, you must have ways to handle such weather, no?” Guanyu redirected the conversation.

His question struck true. Xiaomei, a serpent-dwelling cultivator akin to others of her kind, had roamed these sands for centuries. Predators like her either hunted unrefined beasts—or humans. Surviving hundreds of storms, she undoubtedly possessed strategies.

“Of course I’ve endured many such tempests,” Xiaomei replied airily. “I’ve grown accustomed, hence my lack of panic. But severity varies. Some squalls pass swiftly, while others rage for days—unpredictable as the desert itself.”

**Chapter 4546: Nothing at All**

“You’re avoiding the crux,” Guanyu pressed. “What do you do when storms tear apart the felt tents?”

“Nothing complicated,” she shrugged. “I shield myself with protective spells, revert to my true form, and wait out the chaos. We serpents aren’t afraid of such weather. Even buried under dunes, we emerge unscathed. But you humans? Death would claim you swiftly.”

She added, “We fear neither rain nor wind. When gales strike, we burrow into the sand. But you? A tornado might whisk you away forever.”

Siqi’s anxiety deepened. Her earlier resolve had crumbled, leaving her reliant on Guanyu’s presence to stave off despair.

“Even if the tent fails, we’ll endure,” Guanyu reassured. “We’ll cast protective shields to block the rain. Preserving spiritual energy is key—minimal power can sustain us long enough.”

Siqi found logic in his words, though worry lingered. Guanyu’s frustration simmered—if only the Yunqing Sect members were gathered here! United, they could huddle together, rope-bound against the wind, pooling their magic to conserve strength.

“But what of the camels?” Siqi fretted.

“If it comes to that, we’ll prioritize survival,” Guanyu said firmly. “Camels can be replaced—through purchase or negotiation. The Jia Yi Sect has many. Even if Xiaomei refuses, silver will persuade her.”

**Chapter 4547: No Deception**

“Your plan has merit,” Xiaomei conceded, “but overwhelming winds complicate matters. Rebuilding after storms is tiresome—we’ve learned through bitter experience. Our tents are sturdily anchored with thick hides. Unless the storm proves catastrophic, they’ll hold. Worrying now serves no purpose.”

Guanyu acknowledged her point, yet unease persisted. Modern concrete towers from his homeland felt infinitely safer than these flapping shelters. The serpent sisters’ nonchalance contrasted sharply with Siqi’s trauma—a childhood village erased by sandstorms, leaving her orphaned until Sect Leader Dai rescued her. Now, tempests resurrected those ghosts.

“Siqi,” Guanyu murmured, “it won’t be as dire as your memories. We’ll channel our spiritual energy if needed. Observe Xiaomei’s calm—follow her example.”

“But our fellow disciples? The camels?” Siqi pressed.

“The Jia Yi Sect has camels to spare,” Guanyu asserted, glancing at Xiaomei. “We’ll pay silver if required. Right, Xiaomei?”

“We have some,” the serpent-woman admitted, “though raising them here is arduous. Water and fodder are scarce. But for sufficient silver...” Her smile turned predatory.

“We’re partners,” Guanyu countered. “Price us fairly, or we’ll all suffer delays.”

“You might trudge through sand,” Xiaomei smirked. “I’ll keep my camels.”

A thunderous crack interrupted them—lightning striking nearby. Through ventilation holes, Guanyu spotted flapping hides: the camel tent had ruptured.

**Chapter 4548: Unease**

“I must check the others,” Guanyu declared.

“It’s too dangerous!” Siqi protested. “Quicksand forms in soaked dunes!”

“I’m not abandoning our sectmates—Wang Jun and Aze are out there!”

Xiaomei sneered, “This is my domain. I’ll not harbor your rabble.”

Guanyu met her glare. “Would you have me forsake comrades? I cannot.”

“Let the storm cull them,” she said coldly. “Fewer rivals when we seek the Eight-Sided Drum Art.”

Another thunderous roar shook the air as Guanyu hesitated, torn between safety and duty.
