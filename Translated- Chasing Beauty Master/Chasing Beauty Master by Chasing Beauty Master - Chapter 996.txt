“Second to Wolf (Jicilang) had no desire to waste time with Guan Yu here. He still had gambling appointments to keep. ‘What exactly did you summon me for?’ he asked. ‘You wouldn’t explain over the phone. Now that we’ve met, will you finally spit it out?’

‘Of course I’ll tell you now,’ Guan Yu replied bluntly. ‘I want you to kill someone for me.’ The declaration elicited no reaction from Second to Wolf, but Xue Jing nearly choked on her juice. Knowing her place as a woman, she wisely kept silent, focusing on her drink.

‘Kill someone?’ Second to Wolf arched an eyebrow. ‘Who?’ He’d received countless assassination requests—all paid commissions. Yet here was Guan Yu, expecting free labor. ‘If it’s too troublesome, I’m not interested.’

‘It’s straightforward,’ Guan Yu insisted, ‘though the target is cunning. Have you heard of Yingshan Gu (Aunt of Camp Mountain)?’

‘Yingshan Gu…’ Second to Wolf frowned, the name ringing a bell. ‘A Jianghu practitioner, right? The one who bought that mithril sword at the Yang family auction?’

Guan Yu looked surprised. ‘You’re well-informed.’

Second to Wolf poured himself wine with affected elegance. ‘Don’t envy my intelligence network. It’s beyond your comprehension.’

Suppressing an eye-roll, Guan Yu pressed on. ‘Enough posturing. You know about the treasure map. I gave Yingshan Gu a fake. She hasn’t realized yet, and she’s currently nursing a gunshot wound. You must eliminate her before she recovers. If she discovers the deception, she’ll retaliate—and the entire Qiaoyuan District will suffer.’

He emphasized the last point deliberately. Yingzi resided in Qiaoyuan, and Second to Wolf would never let harm befall that area.

‘Is this Yingshan Gu truly so formidable?’ Second to Wolf scoffed. ‘Daring to cause trouble in Qiaoyuan? That district’s defenses are impenetrable—even stray cats can’t slip through.’ He himself avoided approaching its perimeter alarms.

‘Earlier you boasted about your intelligence network,’ Guan Yu mocked, ‘yet you don’t know Yingshan Gu’s reputation? She’s infamous not for martial prowess, but for her mastery of poisons. No one crosses her lightly.’

‘I despise underhanded poison-users,’ Second to Wolf muttered, inadvertently insulting his ally Jinhua.

‘If she finds out about the fake map,’ Guan Yu continued, ‘she’ll unleash venomous insects on Qiaoyuan. Imagine if a centipede bit Yingzi…’ He left the threat hanging, chilling even Xue Jing. In truth, Yingshan Gu wasn’t that fearsome—Guan Yu simply exaggerated to motivate Second to Wolf.

‘Moreover,’ he added, ‘she purchased that mithril sword to cultivate toxic creatures. Mithril itself is poisonous.’

Though reluctant to work unpaid, Second to Wolf acquiesced for Yingzi’s sake. ‘Any leads on her whereabouts?’

‘None,’ Guan Yu admitted. ‘But she’ll likely hide somewhere remote to heal and refine her poisons.’

Second to Wolf grimaced. Not only was this a free, dangerous job—he had to track the target himself. ‘At least send someone to gather intel! How am I supposed to find her?’

Guan Yu smirked. ‘Weren’t you just bragging about your unmatched intelligence network?’

Trapped by his own boasting, Second to Wolf grudgingly accepted the dual task. Perhaps confronting Yingshan Gu would prove an interesting challenge.

**Chapter 2547: Deadline**

‘Give me time to locate her,’ Second to Wolf growled. ‘If I fail, don’t blame me.’

‘You’ll succeed,’ Guan Yu said cheerfully. ‘A top-tier assassin like you? Finding this minor figure will be effortless.’

Xue Jing chimed in, ‘Imagine if Yingzi heard her mighty brother couldn’t track one woman…’

‘Fine! I’ll find her!’ Second to Wolf snapped, pride stung. ‘But I need a timeframe.’

‘Don’t push your luck,’ Second to Wolf warned, downing his drink. ‘You’re not a paying client!’

‘Yingzi said you’d do this free of charge,’ Guan Yu countered. ‘Unless you want her knowing you failed… If Yingshan Gu recovers, Qiaoyuan—and Yingzi—will be endangered.’

Deflated, Second to Wolf relented. ‘One week. I’ll try.’

‘Splendid! Truly worthy of your elite status!’

Unimpressed by the flattery, Second to Wolf demanded details. ‘Her strengths? Weaknesses?’

‘She employs poison-coated insects as projectiles,’ Guan Yu explained. ‘Even grazing them causes中毒. Her轻功 (lightness skill) is exceptional, but she’s vulnerable in close combat.’

‘Then I’ll engage her directly once found,’ Second to Wolf decided.

After finalizing plans, he hurried off to gamble, eager to escape Guan Yu’s manipulations.

Watching him leave, Guan Yu mused, ‘He dotes on Yingzi excessively. They’re siblings—why the need to impress?’

‘He wants her to feel protected,’ Xue Jing observed. ‘To be her pillar of strength.’

Guan Yu’s phone interrupted—Wei Hongwei reported Fang Su’s men causing trouble at the west district construction site.

**Chapter 2548: No Debt Owed**

At the abandoned site, Fang Su confronted Guan Yu with fifty hired cultivators. ‘Return the five million you extorted from my sister Fang Ding! Kneel and apologize, or blood will spill!’

‘Extorted?’ Guan Yu laughed, sipping tea. ‘That was compensation for her transgressions. She hasn’t complained—why do you?’

Fang Su’s temper flared. ‘You’ll regret this arrogance!’

‘Your family’s arrogance precedes you,’ Guan Yu retorted. ‘I owe you nothing. Leave before you regret it.’

Wei Hongwei and the Yu Gang members bristled, ready for battle. Guan Yu assessed the mercenary cultivators—expensive hires, but no match for his resolve.

‘Fang Ding understood opposing me brings ruin,’ Guan Yu said coldly. ‘Will you share her wisdom… or her fate?’
