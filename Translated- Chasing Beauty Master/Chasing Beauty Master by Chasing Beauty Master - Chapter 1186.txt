As Yu Shida soared through the air, he spewed a mouthful of blood. The impact had been too tremendous. Though he had unleashed his most ferocious attack, he hadn't anticipated that Second Only to the Wolf had long been awaiting this very moment.

The instant Yu Shida collided with his opponent's twin axes, an overwhelming force sent him hurtling backward. His internal energy churned violently within him. A metallic sweetness rose in his throat as another spurt of blood escaped his lips.

Thud! When the spectators regained their vision, only Second Only to the Wolf remained motionless on the platform. Yu Shida had vanished.

Those standing at the edges saw clearly—the man had been flung off the arena, rolling on the ground like a bloated sack of grain. His corpulent frame rendered him incapable of rising.

The elderly referee hurried onto the stage and declared, “Yu Shida has been expelled from the arena! Guan Yu wins this match! Who among you wishes to challenge next? Step forth boldly!”

Lin Qiaoqiao’s face blossomed into a radiant smile. Her heart fluttered with relief—surely no opponent remained who could threaten them now. Today’s turmoil would finally reach its peaceful conclusion.

She knew perfectly well the figure on stage wasn’t Guan Yu, but rather his mysterious protector. Never had she imagined this guardian would prove so formidable.

Even Lin Zhonggeng stood astonished. Had this powerhouse not been their ally, today’s outcome might have spiraled into disaster.

Though immobilized in the crowd, Li Gui watched the spectacle with mounting dread. Yu Shida—a First-Class Esteemed Expert, one of the Jianghu’s Ten Infamous Villains—had been hired at great expense by his father. Yet here he lay defeated.

**Chapter 3042: Keeping One’s Word**

Lin Zhonggeng’s audacity shocked all—demanding the Li Family’s young master kneel and apologize publicly to the Lin Family. Yet Li Gui’s rash defiance of the patriarch justified such severity.

“Done! The bargain is struck!” Li Gui agreed without hesitation. Certainty anchored his heart—this impostor couldn’t possibly be Guan Yu, whose skills paled before such might. Soon, Lin Qiaoqiao would be his. Years of longing had driven him to hire this expensive mercenary, only to watch the Lin Family’s schemes dismantle everything.

This gamble represented Li Gui’s final desperate play—staking all on exposing the impersonator.

Lin Zhonggeng, following Guan Yu’s instructions, proclaimed, “Then let us summon Guan Yu forth! He shall remove his cloak before all, proving our honor!”

Lin Qiaoqiao approached the arena, unaware of the conspiracy between her father and Guan Yu. “Father,” she fretted, “why indulge their demands? We know his identity—must we bare it publicly?”

Li Gui’s suspicions flared at her protest. “Does the vaunted Lin Family break oaths?” he jeered. “Even in selecting a son-in-law, must you skulk in shadows? How the mighty have fallen!”

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Lin Zhonggeng thundered, “The Lin Family keeps its word! We’ll provide proof, but mind your own promise, Young Master Li!”

“My word is iron!” Li Gui crowed inwardly. Once that cloak fell, Lin Qiaoqiao would belong to him.

“Father, this is too risky!” Lin Qiaoqiao pleaded. Lin Zhonggeng reassured, “Fear not, my child. Let truth illuminate our integrity. The Lin Family acts without shame!”

Turning to the cloaked figure, Lin Zhonggeng commanded, “Reveal yourself and cleanse our family’s name.”

Before Lin Qiaoqiao could protest further, the hood fell away. A handsome face emerged, drawing gasps from the crowd. “Guan Yu…!” she breathed, joy flooding her heart. Now she understood—her father and beloved had orchestrated this masterful ruse.

**The Bitter Revelation**

Li Gui’s world crumbled. Second Only to the Wolf—now changed into fresh garments—materialized behind him, slapping the immobilizing needle from his shoulder. As feeling returned, Li Gui swayed but remained standing, refusing to believe his eyes.

“Impossible!” he spat. “This is deception! The Lin Family swaps players mid-game!”

“Young Master Li!” Lin Zhonggeng’s voice cracked like a whip. “You accused us without evidence, roused the crowd against us. Now truth stares you in the face, yet you persist in slander? State your true purpose!”

The scheme unfolded—during Li Gui’s initial outburst, Second Only to the Wolf had slipped from the platform with preternatural speed. Guan Yu took his place undetected, while the protector changed attire and flanked Li Gui.

Every move had been prearranged between Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng, their wager included. Even Lin Qiaoqiao’s genuine distress played into the deception, cementing Li Gui’s conviction.

Trapped in his own snare, Li Gui stood speechless before the irrefutable.

**Unmasking Villainy**

Guan Yu addressed the crowd, “Li Gui, shall we recount your family’s crimes? How does scum like you hold standing in this town?” He produced a sinister needle—five centimeters long, its surface oozing black vapor under sunlight. “This poisoned needle pierced me last night at Old Li’s hand. Recall Wu Wenbo?”

The name ignited whispers. Wu Wenbo—last year’s top scholar in both literary and martial trials—had mysteriously perished after surpassing Li Gui’s scores. Guan Yu continued, “His ‘sudden illness’ stemmed from this very toxin. The Li Family silences all who outshine them!”

The crowd erupted. Guan Yu exposed more atrocities—disappearances of talented youths, rigged competitions, covert assassinations. Each revelation hammered nails into the Li Family’s coffin.

**Chapter 3043: Retribution Multiplied**

As the mob’s fury swelled, Li Gui attempted appeasement: “Uncle Lin! Mere jests between families! Surely you’ll not humiliate me?”

“Your jests carried venom,” Lin Zhonggeng coldly retorted. “Now taste their bitterness. Kneel!”

“Kneel! Apologize!” the crowd chanted. Under Second Only to the Wolf’s unyielding grip, Li Gui collapsed to his knees. “I… apologize to the Lin Family,” he ground out through clenched teeth.

“This isn’t over!” Guan Yu declared. “Last night’s ambush, Wu Wenbo’s murder—your house crumbles today!” He brandished the poisoned needle. “Witness the Li Family’s true face!”

The town’s magistrate emerged—a cultivator of evident prowess. Lin Qiaoqiao identified him to Guan Yu: “Magistrate Wang.”

As the crowd bayed for justice, Li Gui seethed with impotent rage. Every hissed insult, every fleck of spittle striking his face, stoked darker resolves. The Lin Family’s triumph would birth vengeance tenfold—this he swore silently. But for now, the wolf stood at bay.
