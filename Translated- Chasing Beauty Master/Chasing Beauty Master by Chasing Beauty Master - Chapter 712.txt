“Kaihuang Academy truly lives up to its reputation as the most luxurious school. The botanical grove to the left of the sports field alone is remarkably vast, containing numerous plants and trees aged several decades to centuries, each of immense value.

At the center of this arboreal expanse lies a small lake where Ah Mei currently floats in a boat, shooting outdoor scenes. Security barriers already encircle the waterfront to prevent overcrowded students from tumbling into the waters.

The lake's considerable size renders Ah Mei's features indistinct from the shore. Only Guan Yu's extraordinary vision allows him to clearly see her – clad in a white lace gown that contours her alluring figure, performing graceful poses like a bride in her wedding dress. Her flawless complexion bears no trace of cosmetics, her exquisite features forming near-perfect symmetry.

'No imperfections' – Guan Yu's silent appraisal of feminine beauty.

Though positioned relatively close with Wei Hongwei, Lü Mei standing before them still struggles to discern Ah Mei's details across the distance.

Guan Yu suggested, "Brother Wei, this isn't worth watching. Let's get lunch."

"Just a bit longer!" Wei Hongwei's glowing eyes remained fixed on the lake center. "Wait till she docks for a closer look!"

"Pervert," Guan Yu muttered under his breath.

Eventually, the boat began drifting shoreward. Wei Hongwei excitedly shouted, "Here they come! Looks like they'll dock right where we're standing!"

Guan Yu surveyed their position, realizing they'd inadvertently stationed themselves at the staff assembly area and prepared docking point. As the crowd pressed closer, Wei Hongwei's drooling anticipation reached its peak when Ah Mei finally disembarked.

Waving to students with dimpled cheeks glowing against alabaster skin, Ah Mei announced, "Thank you all for coming! We'll be randomly distributing concert tickets and signed CDs later!"

The crowd erupted in whistles and cheers. When Ah Mei's gaze fell on Guan Yu's group, her startled expression made Wei Hongwei's nose bleed profusely.

"Pathetic," Lü Mei sighed, handing him tissues.

Ignoring protocol, Ah Mei walked directly toward Guan Yu. Mistakenly believing her attention was for him, Wei Hongwei exhausted his tissue supply trying to staunch the crimson flow.

Palms pressed against nose and pounding heart, Wei Hongwei nearly fainted as Ah Mei stopped before Guan Yu. After smiling at Lü Mei, she addressed Guan Yu with puzzled recognition: "Guan Yu?"

The crowd's envious glares intensified as Ah Mei confirmed, "Are you Guan Yu?"

"Uh, yes... Do we know each other?"

Audible groans spread through the crowd – "Is this idiot serious? The goddess approaches him and he acts clueless?"

"I'm Xiao Mei! Don't you remember?" Her face fell at his blank expression. "A year ago when my father's company was sabotaged and Mother needed expensive surgery – you intervened with financial help and American specialists. I wrote 'About You' because of that! That song made me famous! I could never mistake your face – Mother insisted we repay you!"

Guan Yu scratched his head, genuinely perplexed. Murmurs rippled through bystanders – "So HE'S the muse behind her hit song!"

"Apologies," Guan Yu explained. "I lost my memory in an accident."

"Then let's start anew!" Ah Mei extended her hand. "Hello, I'm Ah Mei." Their handshake drew applause for her sincerity.

Later in the cafeteria, Xue Jing materialized beside Guan Yu's group. "So the little enchantress got tamed?" she teased, noting Lü Mei's blush. When Guan Yu asked about Ah Mei, Xue Jing retorted, "What's it matter? Seems every beauty connects with you!"

"Must be my peach blossom destiny," Guan Yu grinned. Wei Hongwei chimed in: "Boss Guan rules!"

Their banter shattered by a snarling voice: "Rule this, bastard! You Guan Yu?" A gaunt middle-aged man flipped their table violently.

As Lü Mei screamed, Xue Jing identified the aggressor: "He Chuan! Looking for trouble?"

The confrontation escalated until Guan Yu's counterkick sent He Chuan sprawling. "Stay away from Ah Mei," the limping man threatened before retreating.

Post-conflict, Xue Jing revealed Ah Mei's background: "Her father's company rose through Huayu Group's support. You funded her mother's overseas treatment – she wanted to marry you then."

Their walk through campus was interrupted by Wang Jun – a boyish girl relentlessly pursuing Xue Jing. When Wei Hongwei intervened, a vicious groin kick left him writhing.

"Will he... become China's last eunuch?" Lü Mei worried aloud after Wang Jun departed with Xue Jing.

Guan Yu's healing qi stabilized Wei Hongwei, though warning: "Avoid using that area temporarily."

The day's chaos culminated at school gates when Lan Yu – the motorcycle girl Guan Yu previously rescued – arrived in a red Hummer, flanked by Xue Jing, Lü Mei, Ah Mei, and teacher Pan Xiaoxia.

"Handsome! I'm here to repay you with my body!" Lan Yu's bold declaration triggered a four-way standoff between the women.

As crowds gathered, Guan Yu faced his storm of peach blossoms – each beauty staking claim while bystanders marveled at this modern emperor's predicament.
