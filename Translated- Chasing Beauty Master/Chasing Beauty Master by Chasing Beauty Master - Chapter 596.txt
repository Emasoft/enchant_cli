“Though Guanyu had secured victory in this match, curiously, not a trace of joy or triumph could be discerned from his expression. This puzzled Elder Griffon profoundly, for in his experience, disciples who achieved even minor accomplishments would invariably grow complacent. Few indeed were those like Guanyu who maintained such unshaken composure.

After silently commending the youth, Elder Griffon prepared to announce the match’s outcome—after all, the crowd cared more about results than the brutal process. Yet as he raised Guanyu’s hand in triumph, the fallen Hu Xiaohai behind Guanyu suddenly sprang to his feet as if injected with frenzied vigor.

Not only Griffon, but all spectators noticed the drastic transformation. Hu Xiaohai’s magical aura had surged explosively, as though he’d vaulted from mediocrity to mastery overnight. More terrifying was his gaze—venomous and violent—locked onto Guanyu.

**Chapter 1511: Unforeseen Turmoil**

Witnessing this, Elder Griffon’s face paled. He abruptly realized this match might not conclude as smoothly as anticipated.

Acting swiftly to intervene, Griffon lunged forward—but too late. Before he could reach Hu Xiaohai, the latter roared: “You worthless trash! I’ll kill you with my own hands!”

Like a blade unleashed, Hu Xiaohai shot toward Guanyu.

“Halt this instant!” Griffon bellowed. But reason had abandoned Hu Xiaohai; his sole purpose now was to slaughter Guanyu by surprise, all else forgotten.

The crowd instantly grasped the truth: Hu Xiaohai must have ingested a potent elixir. No ordinary mage could recover so swiftly from defeat, let alone attack with enhanced ferocity.

This abrupt twist reignited the audience’s waning interest. On the elevated platform, Sect Master Huo Zhentian’s initial relief curdled into dread—this chaos risked costing the Mixed Heaven Sect two prodigies simultaneously.

Beside him, the composed Liu Piaopiao observed Hu Xiaohai’s state and solemnly declared: “Unless I’m mistaken, he’s consumed a Qi-Converging Pill.”

Huo Zhentian’s expression darkened. “That disgrace!” he spat, pulverizing a stone sculpture with a furious palm strike.

Wu Yuying, equally stunned, finally recognized her grave error in opposing Guanyu. Yet pride forbade repentance; she could only double down on her path.

Upon the platform, Liu Piaopiao smiled at Guanyu below. Though she’d anticipated his victory, the ease of his triumph still surprised her. “Sect Master, matters proved simpler than expected. Younger Brother Guanyu harbors many secrets. That magic skill he employed—surely a Mystic-tier technique? Where would a novice acquire such arts?”

Huo Zhentian chuckled without answering. “The lad’s always been cryptic. But his performance today speaks volumes about his dedication.”

As Griffon sighed at Hu Xiaohai’s prone form—*Fool only learns through humiliation, now disgraced before all while elevating Guanyu’s prestige*—the arena erupted anew.

Defying Griffon’s commands, Hu Xiaohai’s bloodlust intensified. Proximity and berserk magical surges placed Guanyu in mortal peril—one strike could end him.

Yet amidst gasps and shouts, Guanyu remained preternaturally calm, his expression unreadable save for tranquil resolve.

When Guanyu moved to meet the assault head-on, Griffon’s alarm spiked. “After that pill, Hu Xiaohai’s power has doubled! Does the boy not grasp his danger?”

Then Guanyu’s voice rang out: “Five Thunder Fist!”

A thunderous boom erupted as five lightning arcs coiled around his fist. Hu Xiaohai blanched, blood-smeared face contorting in realization of utter defeat. Guanyu showed no mercy—with a sweeping motion, he hurled his opponent like a stone across the arena.

The speed left Griffon reeling. As cheers erupted, the elder marveled at Guanyu’s unfathomable depth—*This youth never regarded Hu Xiaohai as a threat from the start.*

Hu Xiaohai’s crumpled form drew all eyes. Alive or dead mattered little now; his vanquisher was the once-mocked “trash” he’d despised.

None could comprehend it—Hu Xiaohai had surpassed Guanyu in every apparent aspect, yet collapsed faster despite enhanced power. A single punch! Was Guanyu’s strength inversely proportional to his opponent’s?

On the platform, Liu Piaopiao gaped at the black-clad youth. Though she’d prepared herself, reality defied belief. Suddenly she recalled: *Five Thunder Fist—is that even a Mixed Heaven technique?*

**Chapter 1512: Five Thunder Fist**

Huo Zhentian’s shock mirrored hers. The answer was clear—this was no sect skill.

“That Five Thunder Fist is at least a mid-Mystic-tier technique,” Liu murmured. “For a novice like Guanyu to obtain even a high Mortal-tier skill is difficult. How…?”

Though the crowd credited Huo Zhentian, the sect master knew the truth—he’d taught Guanyu nothing of the sort. Core Mystic-tier techniques required advanced cultivation.

*Someone formidable stands behind this brat. I must find and thank them—without their guidance, he’d remain worthless.*

Scanning the arena, Huo’s gaze settled on his daughter Huo Lingling, watching Guanyu with undisguised admiration. Though appearing weak, she’d reached Advanced Mage status under his tutelage and knew sect secrets. Could she have taught him?

Meanwhile, Guanyu wearily relaxed his battle-tensed muscles. Spotting Wu Yuying emerging from the crowd, he steeled himself—this woman had despised him from their first meeting. Yet adversaries, he mused, were as vital as allies for growth.

Instead of confronting Guanyu, Wu rushed to Hu Xiaohai. After assessing his injuries, she carried him away, face etched with grief.

Guanyu felt no pity—not from cruelty, but principle. Had Hu shown restraint, mercy might follow. But treachery demanded consequence.

Approaching the dazed Griffon, Guanyu asked: “Is the match concluded? May I depart?”

Before Griffon could answer, a shrill cry pierced the air: “You little runt, don’t you dare leave!”

**Chapter 1513: Expert Intervention**

All turned to Wu Yuying, standing over Hu Xiaohai’s bloodied form.

“How dare you disrupt proceedings!” Griffon thundered. “Would you breach sect laws?”

“What now?” Guanyu coldly eyed her. “Seeking revenge publicly?”

Wu advanced defiantly. “So you’re frightened?” When met with silence, she pressed: “Even if Hu erred, he’s your sect brother! How could you brutalize him thus?”

Guanyu scoffed. “As a senior sister, making such a spectacle over juniors’ rivalry—how unbecoming.”

Enraged, Wu pointed accusingly. “Silver-tongued viper! You maim a brother without remorse, yet lecture me? Today I’ll teach you propriety in the Sect Master’s stead!”

As Wu persisted, Griffon interposed himself. “Yuying! Withdraw now or face punishment!”

Unyielding, Wu trembled with fury—no one had tended to Hu Xiaohai. In this moment, she finally understood the isolation Guanyu had once endured.
