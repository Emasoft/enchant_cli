When Xue Jing spoke, Xiao Gen felt his legs go weak. He knew Xue Jing all too well, as they were classmates.

Xue Jing was the type to act on her words—a true she-devil. Once provoked, she was capable of anything.

“Why are you here?” Guan Yu asked.

“Didn’t you want to modify your car? I came to tell you the mechanic’s been arranged. Also wanted to check on you. Didn’t expect to run into these scumbags.”

Xiao Gen and the others scurried out timidly. Guan Yu turned and patted Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo on the shoulder, nodding. Xue Jing handed him a slip of paper with a number. “Here’s the mechanic’s contact. Call him directly.”

As she spoke, Xue Jing glanced at Lü Mei beside her. “Ah, out of all these beauties, Lü Mei’s the luckiest, sitting next to you every day. Not like me—sometimes I don’t see you for days.”

Lü Mei retorted, “We don’t sit together *every* day. He skips school for days sometimes!”

“Unacceptable! I’m swapping your seats. Either Lü Mei moves or you do. Sitting next to this ‘bubble-free campus belle’ all day, you’ve grown indifferent to me at home!”

Just then, Pan Xiaoxia entered as class began. Xue Jing declared loudly, “Teacher Pan, shouldn’t Guan Yu change seats?”

“Student Xue Jing, where do you suggest we move him?”

Pan Xiaoxia knew Xue Jing and her unusual relationship with Guan Yu, so she spoke politely.

“Anywhere! Preferably next to the ugliest girl in class. Otherwise, he’ll keep flirting outside—too many beauties around him, making him bored.”

The class erupted in laughter. Even Pan Xiaoxia smirked. “If Guan Yu agrees, I don’t mind. He can sit wherever.”

Wei Hongwei stood up. “Why not have Brother Guan sit by me?”

A murderous glare shot his way. Lü Mei turned, eyes blazing with lethal intent, terrifying Wei Hongwei into slumping back into his seat, silent.

**Chapter 1855: Bringing Glory to Women**

Guan Yu, this playboy, left Xue Jing exasperated. “I’m having dinner with old girlfriends tonight. You’re coming. No bringing other girls.”

Guan Yu hesitated. He didn’t know Xue Jing’s friends. “Your girls’ night—I shouldn’t intrude.”

“You’re *my* man. Why wouldn’t you go?” Xue Jing glared.

“I don’t know them. I’ll just be bored. Better to sleep at home.”

“You’ll meet them! They’re all beauties. Meet one, meet a dozen. Since when do you pass up such chances?” Xue Jing giggled.

After school, Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo accompanied Guan Yu out, fearing Ran Qiang might ambush them.

Guan Yu rode in Xue Jing’s car to Xiangfu Residence, their meeting spot. On the third floor, raucous laughter echoed from a private room before they entered. Guan Yu disliked such scenes.

The room’s opulence stunned him—white wool carpet requiring shoes off, a massive crystal chandelier casting soft light.

Several women clad in luxury brands, around 19-20 years old, radiated youthful energy.

“Last night, I picked up a young stud. Five rounds! He’s still passed out at my place. Tonight, I’ll drain him dry again. My skin’s already glowing!”

“Damn, Big Pineapple! How long’ve you been backed up? Don’t kill the kid!”

“Your husband’s the heir of Huanyang Corp. Can’t he satisfy you? If he finds out you’re cheating—”

“Screw that bastard! He’s got countless mistresses. I’m just quenching my thirst!”

“Five times in one night? Big Pineapple, you’re our heroine!”

Xue Jing entered with Guan Yu. All eyes locked onto him.

Their gazes pierced like he was naked—a lamb among wolves.

“Our Jingjing’s upgraded! No wonder she’s glowing—feeding on this stallion daily!”

“A tender colt! Must be skilled in bed.”

A stranger caked in makeup leered, “A student! I love the barely-fledged ones.”

These high-society women, all attractive with exposed limbs, made Guan Yu feel like prey.

“Enough! Had I known you hussies would be here, I’d have left him home.” Xue Jing pointed at Guan Yu. “Don’t embarrass me.”

Big Pineapple—Tong Yan—laughed. “Don’t scare him limp, Jingjing. But... could we borrow him?”

“Share the stud! Men are for using. Young stamina—he’ll last more than five rounds!”

Guan Yu sweated. Xue Jing’s circle was wilder than he’d imagined.

“They’re always like this. You’ll get used to it,” Xue Jing whispered.

These women expected all men to be horny beasts. Yet Guan Yu’s shyness intrigued them—maybe an act since Xue Jing was present.

“A bashful one! Come sit by me, little brother. I’ll protect you.” Zhao Xin beckoned, her toned figure leaning forward.

Big Pineapple warned, “Avoid her! This divorcee’s been thirsty for a year. She’ll suck you dry.”

Zhao Xin smirked. “You sluts are worse! Jingjing and I are tight. Her man’s mine.”

Amid the banter, Xue Jing seated Guan Yu beside Zhao Xin.

Noticing her awkward posture, Guan Yu remarked, “Sister Zhao, you have severe hemorrhoids.”

The room exploded in laughter.

“From taking it both ways!”

“Overusing toys!”

Zhao Xin flushed. “Office chairs caused this!”

**Chapter 1856: High Society**

High society’s young elite women reveled together—Guan Yu’s first exposure. Older matrons compared designer goods; younger ones discussed men.

Zhao Xin, running her mother’s cosmetics firm, suffered chronic hemorrhoids from desk work.

Big Pineapple teased, “She’s ridden every rich heir. No wonder her backside’s wrecked.”

Zhao Xin ignored her, asking Guan Yu, “How’d you know?”

“Your posture. If you trust me, I can cure it.”

“You?”

“He treated my cramps,” Xue Jing vouched.

Skeptical chuckles arose.

Guan Yu explained, “Hemorrhoids stem from digestive issues. I’ll adjust your diet and use acupuncture.”

“Acupuncture? Let’s do it now!” Zhao Xin suggested.

Xue Jing objected, “You just want to strip him!”

“I’ll just lift my shirt!”

“Not today. I need needles.”

“Teasing me?” Zhao Xin fumed.

Guan Yu offered, “Let me regulate your meridians.”

Holding her hand, he channeled energy. “You drink too much and... overindulge.”

“So hot!” Zhao Xin gasped as warmth spread through her.

The women heckled: “Just a handhold makes you wet?”

**Chapter 1857: Lending Big Sister for a Few Days**

Amid the chaos, Guan Yu noted a lesbian cultivator—Third-Level Adept—among them. Most cultivators understood healing, yet these women remained oblivious.

“No need to undress. Just lift the back.”

Zhao Xin immediately hiked her top, revealing her lower back.

“Not now. I’m unprepared.”

“Fucking jerk!” Zhao Xin cursed.

Apologizing, Guan Yu promised future treatment. Xue Jing chatted elsewhere, oblivious.

The women’s wild energy overwhelmed Guan Yu—a baptism into their hedonistic world.
