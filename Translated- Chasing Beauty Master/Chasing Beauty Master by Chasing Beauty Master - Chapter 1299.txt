“And you’ve only encountered a minor disciple. Those who truly master the Blood Wing Technique to higher levels can transform into bats with massive crimson wings when channeling their energy. Their speed surpasses even real bats, making them incredibly formidable opponents.”

“That powerful?” Guan Yu exclaimed in astonishment.

“Indeed,” Second-to-Wolf continued. “Even when I fought this individual, I could sense his profound cultivation. I couldn’t subdue him quickly. But isn’t this a world of immortal cultivation? How do such beings exist here? If immortal cultivators like you faced them, wouldn’t you all perish? Moreover, I noticed they don’t use internal energy. What’s going on?”

“Brother Second-to-Wolf,” Elder Lu interjected, “perhaps your brief encounter or lack of familiarity with immortal cultivators limits your understanding. While it’s true most immortal cultivators rely on spells for combat, you might assume this merely involves chanting incantations from a stationary position?”

Both Second-to-Wolf and Guan Yu nodded. “Isn’t that how it works?”

“In reality, many spells enhance the caster’s own body. By channeling spiritual energy, one can temporarily amplify strength and speed for close combat—exactly what the Blood Wing Technique achieves. Now you see why they’re so formidable?”

Hearing this, Second-to-Wolf frowned. “Then aren’t they identical to martial cultivators? Why bother with spells at all? Why do you need guardians when such direct methods exist?”

“You overcomplicate matters,” Elder Lu countered. “While such spells exist, they’re like my sect’s techniques—unattainable without precise mantras and hand seals. The Blood Wing Technique of the Demon Sect’s Black Blood Ridge is a closely guarded art, requiring grueling sacrifices to learn. Moreover, their physical enhancements only manifest during energy channeling. Otherwise, they remain ordinary mortals, still inferior to true martial cultivators.”

This explanation somewhat comforted Second-to-Wolf. Martial cultivators dedicated far more effort than immortal practitioners—if such enhancement spells became widespread, it would render their sacrifices meaningless.

Guan Yu murmured, “The world never ceases to amaze with its wonders.”

“The Demon Sect’s methods run deep,” Elder Lu warned. “What you’ve witnessed is but a fraction. There’s much more to learn.”

Guan Yu couldn’t argue. Elder Lu, a centuries-old veteran, dwarfed his own mere decades of life—especially with his recent memory loss. “Have you read the Sect Leader’s sealed letter yet?” Elder Lu inquired.

Guan Yu shook his head. The previous day at Tiger’s Head Peak Hall, Sect Leader Xuanming had discreetly passed him a confidential missive, fearing Demon Sect spies among their ranks. The instructions were to be read only after descending the mountain.

“Let me reveal this,” Elder Lu whispered. “The letter commands you to disrupt the Demon Sect’s plans at Black Blood Ridge. You’ll understand in time.”

Guan Yu nodded, though he trusted Yunqing Sect would eventually handle these cultists. The discussion concluded without resolving how to root out the infiltrators, but Guan Yu cared little—tomorrow’s mission would take him far from mountain affairs.

Emerging into the night, Guan Yu stewed in frustration. His recent severe injury worried him—if his cultivation remained stunted, he’d lose his mind. “Brother Second-to-Wolf, rest first. I need to walk,” he said.

The mercenary, sensing his mood, agreed. “The cultist’s fled anyway. I’ll retire—too much wine weighs my eyelids.”

Alone in the woods outside Qianhui Peak, Guan Yu pondered his unreliable internal energy. Did disuse weaken it? Or did the unsealed energy resist control, requiring磨合? Deep down, he knew neither explanation sufficed. While his spiritual energy responded better, mastery still eluded him.

He envied Siqi and Xiaozhi, who’d fully absorbed their transmitted cultivation. Though they gained specialized knowledge—spells for A’ze, alchemy for Xiaozhi—Guan Yu received only raw energy. The legacy transmission, disrupted by his mental seal, left him empty-handed despite reaching the tournament’s semifinals—a hollow victory.

Moonlight dimmed abruptly. An unnatural stillness gripped the forest. Cold wind whipped past as a shadow lunged. Guan Yu dodged, fists meeting clawed strikes that sent him skidding backward.

He turned to flee—without Second-to-Wolf, survival demanded retreat. “Damned beast!” he cursed. “Disturbing my night stroll! I’ll live to fight another day!”

But the winged monstrosity closed fast. Agony ripped through his recently bandaged wound as claws struck again, hurling him bloodied to the ground. The creature pounced for the kill, razor talons aimed at his throat.

Death’s vacuum enveloped Guan Yu. Desperate, his energy remained inert. “Is this truly my end?” he thought, disbelief warring with resignation.

Steel rang. A blade intercepted the killing strike. Through dazed vision, Guan Yu saw a grey-haired figure in billowing white robes—Master Jiu, radiating authority as he stood between Guan Yu and death.

“Master Jiu?!” Guan Yu gasped, astonished. The immortal elder wielded a slender sword with martial precision, defying Guan Yu’s assumptions about spellcasters.

“Filthy beast!” Master Jiu thundered. “Dare harm my disciple on Yunqing soil? Your life ends tonight!”

Sword clashed against metallic claws as crimson wings beat furiously. Though the monster fought savagely, Master Jiu’s superior technique soon forced it back. With a roar, the creature summoned a swarm of black bats, only to meet a storm of spiritual swords materializing around the elder.

The battle climaxed in a burst of light. Impaled by multiple blades, the monster fled in a smoke bomb’s cover. “Swift escape,” Master Jiu grumbled, sheathing his sword. Turning to Guan Yu, he asked, “Injured?”

“Superficial wounds, thanks to your timely rescue,” Guan Yu replied, still processing how an immortal elder fought like a seasoned swordsman.

Elder Lu later scolded Guan Yu for returning to the danger zone, while Master Jiu explained his pursuit—the creature had trespassed the Ancestral Shrine, fleeing upon detection. Its knowledge of hidden mountain paths troubled them all, suggesting deeper infiltration.

As Guan Yu recuperated, bitter lessons churned in his mind. The Demon Sect’s threat loomed larger, his own weaknesses starker. With travel delayed by injury, he contemplated the shadowy figures seen earlier—high-ranking sect members? The black-furred monster in disguise? Yunqing’s security teetered on a knife’s edge.

Master Jiu’s final warning echoed: “This creature is the same one from six years ago. The Demon Sect’s schemes began long ago.”

Bandaged and restless, Guan Yu realized the true battle transcended physical confrontations—it lurked in trust’s shadows, where allies and enemies wore identical robes. The night’s events were mere prelude to a storm that would test Yunqing Sect’s very foundations.
