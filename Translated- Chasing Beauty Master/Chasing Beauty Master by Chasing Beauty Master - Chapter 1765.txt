“But that giant fat pig was no ordinary foe. The beam it instantly shot from its mouth—Guan Yu estimated it was at least a mid-level spell. To unleash such power instantaneously was no feat an ordinary being could achieve.

The little girl had long since noticed Guan Yu’s group, who remained shielded within the protective barrier cast by the elder. As she approached, tension and unease prickled through everyone.

Though the giant pig had been troublesome enough, now that it was gone, this girl—seemingly less fearsome—was unanimously recognized as the greater threat.

All grew vigilant, preparing to confront her. The girl skipped over, studying them curiously. “Where are you all from? You seem so strange. How did you cultivate into human form with such timid hearts?”

Guan Yu blinked. *Cultivate into human form?* These people were born naturally! Did she mistake them for demonic beings? Likely. And given the locals here were likely all demonic practitioners, ordinary humans shouldn’t exist in this realm.

“Hello, little miss,” Guan Yu said gently, fearing to startle her. “We’re newcomers here and unfamiliar with this place. Might I ask you something?”

“Are you ghosts?” The girl’s face lit with morbid fascination. “Today’s the Ghost Festival! Spirits roam free. Most stay hidden indoors, but I sneaked out hoping to meet ghosts! I wanted to see how they differ.”

“Your Ghost Festival?” Guan Yu echoed, surprised. In China, the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month was indeed associated with such legends, though few took it seriously.

To think this realm shared the same custom! Was there some hidden connection between these two worlds?

“Why is that odd? The Ghost Festival happens every year,” the girl said, still grinning as if unbothered by their supposed spectral nature. “Today, no one’s allowed outside—they say ghosts will possess those who wander. Are you ghosts from beyond?”

If her words held truth, something was amiss. Every year on this date, Miao City’s gateway appeared in the desert, allowing outsiders to enter. But those who came were humans, not ghosts. Did the demonic beings here mistake humans for spirits?

Guan Yu pondered this. “Ah, little miss, you’re mistaken. We aren’t ghosts. We’ve come from outside seeking an item and mean no harm.”

“How strange! Elders say ghosts are terrifying, but you’re quite friendly. Why did you choose today to come?”

“Only today could we enter. Other times, it’s impossible,” Guan Yu explained patiently, hoping to glean more information from her.

Though childlike, this girl was likely centuries old—akin to Xiaomei, who’d spent centuries cultivating human form. Demonic children were nothing like human youths; these “children” were ancient beings with sharp minds.

Animals or monsters embarking on the path of cultivation required eons to grow intelligent. Even the dimmest pig, after centuries, would gain human-level wit. Only then could they shape-shift into human form, a process taking centuries. Most began as children, their immature intellects mirroring their youthful appearances. Others emerged as elders, having spent millennia in bestial forms. Some never achieved human shape at all.

Talent varied. As the saying went: *If effort alone sufficed, why would genius exist?* Those lacking aptitude had no choice but to resign themselves to fate.

**Chapter 4618: This Time, I’ll Listen to You**

Guan Yu knew deceiving this girl would be difficult. He’d considered asking directly about the Eight-Sided Drum Technique but feared repercussions.

As he hesitated, a Zhenyang Sect disciple—lured by her innocent demeanor—approached. “Little girl, do you know where the Eight-Sided Drum Technique is hidden?”

“Ahem!” Guan Yu coughed pointedly, watching her reaction. Thankfully, she seemed oblivious.

Relieved, Guan Yu interjected, “Pay him no mind. He’s jesting. Actually, we’re searching for a divine stone said to lie nearby. Have you heard of it?”

“A divine stone? Never.”

Guan Yu’s heart sank. *She knows nothing.* They’d have to keep searching.

Siqi stepped forward, smiling warmly. “Little sister, you’re so lovely.”

Guan Yu tensed, fearing the demonic girl might lash out. “Siqi, don’t startle her!”

“It’s fine! We’ll get along.” Siqi crouched to meet the girl’s eyes. “*Beneath the golden city, upon the divine stone mountain. When flowers bloom, fragrant winds carry afar—the divine art shall reveal itself.* Have you heard this rhyme?”

The girl shook her head. “No. What does it mean?”

Guan Yu sighed. *Dead end.*

Undeterred, Siqi explained, “It speaks of a mountain crowned by a divine stone, surrounded by blooming flowers. Do you know such a place?”

“Oh! The mountain across here has endless flowers—so fragrant!” The girl pointed.

The group perked up, hope rekindled. “Brilliant, Siqi!” Guan Yu said. “Let’s head there at once.”

“But it’s far,” the girl warned. “Reaching it won’t be easy.”

“What dangers lie ahead? If you help us, we’d be safer,” Siqi coaxed, taking her hand.

“I could help, but Miao City blocks the path. They won’t let ‘ghosts’ through.”

Guan Yu frowned. *Miao City? A city here?* Was the desert’s other side their true destination?

Siqi pressed on. “Little sister, stay with us awhile! Tell me about your home.”

“Gladly! No one usually listens—they say I chatter too much.”

Guan Yu agreed. Her stories might unveil clues. “Let’s walk as we talk. With you guarding us, no creature would dare attack.”

The girl preened. “You’re right! In Miao City, none dare cross me. Even the mountain beasts flee when I revert to my true form!”

*True form?* Guan Yu wondered. *A tiger, perhaps?*

**Chapter 4619: Tragedy**

Guan Yu retrieved a sugar pancake from his pouch—a sweet treat from the Heterodox Sect. “Here. Try this.”

The girl popped the entire pancake into her mouth, jaw stretching unnervingly wide. “Delicious! More?”

Guan Yu handed her the remaining five. She devoured them gleefully. “What’s this called?”

“Sugar pancakes. I’ll bring more next time.” *If there is a next time.* “Little miss, is Miao City your home? Do you have family there?”

“No. My mother was killed centuries ago, during my cultivation. An aunt in Miao City took me in.”

“Oh! Forgive me for prying. That’s… tragic.”

“Tragic? I cultivated human form in just four centuries—a prodigy! Few in Miao City rival me.”

Guan Yu realized demonic beings might not value kinship as humans did. Animals often parted from parents early, rendering such bonds trivial.

Siqi asked, “Are there others your age in Miao City?”

“Yes, but they fear me. Most young ones focus on cultivation, unlike me.”

“Is Miao City large?”

“Large… but not too large?” The girl lacked comparison.

“What’s your name, little sister?” Siqi inquired.

The girl smiled, oblivious to the weight of their quest—and the secrets her tales might yet unveil.
