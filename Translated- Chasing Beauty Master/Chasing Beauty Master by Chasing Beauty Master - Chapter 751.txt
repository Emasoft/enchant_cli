Guan Yu shook his head helplessly and said, “Zhang Han, if you keep causing trouble like this, I won’t take you anywhere again. Don’t even mention knowing me.” He truly disliked conflict—not out of fear, but sheer annoyance.

“It wasn’t me causing trouble! They were the ones picking fights! What was I supposed to do?” Zhang Han protested childishly. Too young to understand, she remained oblivious that her striking appearance itself invited complications.

Several men surged forward, surrounding Guan Yu’s table. He surveyed the scene coolly. “What’s this? Looking for a fight?”

“Guan Yu, we know this girl is from Kaihuang. But you’d better stay out of this,” said a relatively composed man from the group. “She attacked our LanZhe member. Today, we’re taking her for accountability.”

“Bullshit! Your LanZhe lackey started it—he groped my shoulder! I showed mercy by not kicking him to death!” Zhang Han retorted fiercely. Though clingy and playful around Guan Yu and Yang Conghan, she transformed into a fiery pepper with outsiders, her words sharp and strikes lethal.

The aggressors hadn’t expected such ferocity from the petite girl. Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei paused his menu browsing, his gaze fixed on the man Zhang Han had kicked. He recalled another incident where a Kaihuang man harassed her and ended up castrated by her foot. Now, he morbidly observed history repeating itself.

The victim’s face had turned ashen, struggling to breathe on the floor. The restaurant manager hurriedly called an ambulance, desperate to avoid a death that would tarnish their business.

Though outnumbered, the LanZhe group rallied their courage. “Brat, keep yapping now. Once we drag you away, scream all you want later!” one taunted.

**Chapter 1905: Repaying the Debt**

Guan Yu’s patience snapped. “You have one minute to vanish. Or I’ll make you.” His authority carried weight—they’d witnessed his prowess that morning.

Yet the allure of the feisty girl emboldened them. “Guan Yu, you’d really meddle?”

“Meddle? Open your eyes! Check your buddy—he’s halfway to the grave!” Wei Hongwei barked, his courage bolstered by Guan Yu’s presence.

All eyes turned to the victim, now purple-lipped and unconscious.

“The ambulance is coming,” the manager interjected nervously. “Please take disputes outside.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “They’re the troublemakers. Call the police if you want them gone.”

“Fine! If my friend dies, you’ll pay!” a LanZhe member spat before retreating with the others as sirens approached.

Zhang Han, utterly unfazed, continued ordering extravagantly.

Wei Hongwei paled. “My lady, spare my wallet! I’ve got a new girlfriend to fund!”

“Cheapskate! Uncle will reimburse you,” she dismissed, still scanning the menu.

Wei inwardly groaned. *Who dares demand money from Guan Yu? Suicide!*

Post-lunch, while others relished the meal, Guan Yu found the raw seafood bland compared to Huaxia cuisine. Zhang Han, devouring portions that defied her petite frame, drew envious stares—her metabolism a girl’s dream.

The group succumbed to Zhang Han’s pestering and revisited the amusement park. Evening brought new chaos as the women squabbled over sleeping arrangements, driving Guan Yu to bunk with Wei Hongwei.

Restless past midnight, Guan Yu wandered streets until accosted by a stranger: “Guan Yu, greetings.”

The middle-aged man introduced himself as Jiang Fenju, a Lower Second-Class Adept. “I signed up for tomorrow’s tournament. Let’s talk.”

**Chapter 1906: Recruitment**

Over tea, Jiang revealed his motive: recruitment into the Free Society, a top-tier cultivator organization led by a Quasi-Sovereign Realm master. “Our branch, the Natural Gang, handles minor tasks. Join us for wealth and prestige.”

Guan Yu probed: “What missions? Kidnappings?”

“All tasks—petty to perilous. Recent ones? Trivial.”

Declining firmly, Guan Yu questioned Jiang’s true intent. The adept left disappointed, pondering his leader’s interest.

**Chapter 1907: First-Class Disability**

Returning at dawn, Guan Yu queried Yang Conghan about her faction, the逍遙 Society—a Free Society subsidiary. His suspicions deepened but yielded no answers.

The tournament loomed, yet Guan Yu’s thoughts lingered on shadowy organizations and unseen strings pulling his fate.
