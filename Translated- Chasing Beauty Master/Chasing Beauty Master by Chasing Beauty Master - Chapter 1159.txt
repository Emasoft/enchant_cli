Luo Bo couldn’t bear to look at Second Only to Wolf for another minute, let alone speak to him. Standing on the second floor, he leaped directly down to the first level.

Seeing the opposing side preparing to leave, Guan Yu quickly intercepted, “Wait! You think you can come and go as you please, treating this place like a supermarket? If you want to leave, hand over eight million. Not a cent less. You’ve taken your people, but the money remains unpaid.”

At this point, Luo Bo was astonished that Guan Yu still dared to demand payment. Second Only to Wolf flipped down to the first floor, landing before Luo Bo. Having been threatened twice by him, Guan Yu decided Luo Bo did not deserve to live.

He ordered Second Only to Wolf to subdue Luo Bo. Startled, Luo Bo coldly retorted, “You think I fear you? A real fight might surprise you.”

Though Luo Bo spoke bravely, Second Only to Wolf acted without hesitation, swinging his long blade downward.

The two clashed violently, their internal Qi energy so overwhelming that the Feng family’s nearby bodyguards fled in panic. Those too close were sent flying, some grazed by the blade’s edge.

The battle scattered the Feng family’s forces. Poison Widow tried to assist Luo Bo but was blocked by Xue Jing, Shen Sheng, and others.

Meanwhile, Hou Jinshun, previously busy, now observed idly. He mused that if these two experts continued fighting, the Hua Ye Club would be reduced to rubble. He wondered how Miss Yang would react upon learning of this.

Time passed swiftly. After Shen Sheng’s group severely wounded Poison Widow, Luo Bo and Second Only to Wolf still battled. Gradually, Second Only to Wolf gained dominance, leaving Luo Bo defenseless, barely parrying attacks.

As Luo Bo spat blood, Second Only to Wolf closed in, kicking him squarely in the chest. Luo Bo crashed into the wooden staircase railing, shattering it before rolling to a stop, too injured to rise.

Second Only to Wolf pressed his blade to Luo Bo’s throat. “Remember how you humiliated me in the organization?” he hissed.

Luo Bo coughed up blood and tissue. “Ancient history. I never thought a mere underling would best me today. I should’ve killed you then.”

Despite his grave injuries, Luo Bo’s defiance persisted. Second Only to Wolf sneered, “Yet here I stand. You’ve stagnated all these years. How does it feel to have our positions reversed?”

“Feel?” Luo Bo laughed bitterly. “I have two choices: die here or wait for Young Master Bill Lin to ransom me. Correct?”

After Poison Widow was bound and tossed beside Luo Bo, Guan Yu chuckled, “Clever. I won’t let such valuable prey escape.”

Though Xiang Jiamian had fled, Second Only to Wolf’s arrival ensured Poison Widow and Luo Bo’s capture. With Feng’s remaining guards outside, Guan Yu anticipated a hefty ransom from Bill Lin, who’d surely pay for Luo Bo.

As fleeing Feng guards were intercepted by Yu Gang reinforcements, Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo entered the devastated club. “Boss,” Wei asked, “we’ve captured many outside. What next?”

“Take them to our base,” Guan Yu replied. “Bill Lin will pay handsomely. Tonight brings a bountiful harvest.”

Realizing the situation was lost, Luo Bo attempted manipulation. “Second Only to Wolf, you deserve better than orbiting Guan Yu. Even as his brother-in-law—”

Seeing through the ploy, Second Only to Wolf remained vigilant. A master like Luo Bo could escape in an instant if unwatched.

“Pride or survival?” Luo Bo shouted, voice echoing through trees where a couple’s tryst in an SUV was interrupted. The terrified lover fled naked, tripped by Second Only to Wolf’s coin toss.

“See that man?” Second Only to Wolf taunted. “You’re alike—both thieves, though you’re still clothed!”

Despite relentless provocation, Luo Bo refused engagement, his thickened skin from serving Bill Lin evident.

“Let’s negotiate,” Second Only to Wolf offered. “Stop running. I vow not to attack—my honor as pledge.”

Slowing, Luo Bo considered. A killer’s reputation mattered. “What terms?”

“Return peacefully. I’ll trade you for Bill Lin’s gold. Beneficial for both.”

Relenting, Luo Bo stipulated, “Stay thirty meters distant during talks.”

Perched on separate trees, Second Only to Wolf reasoned, “We serve different masters. You’d do the same.”

Luo Bo sighed. “I underestimated you. That boy now surpasses me.”

“Enough nostalgia,” Second Only to Wolf cut in. “Promise not to flee before the ransom, and I guarantee your safety.”

“Join Yu Gang,” Guan Yu later proposed to Second Only to Wolf, “and you’ll be deputy leader—second only to me.”

Tempted yet conflicted about abandoning his assassin career, Second Only to Wolf hesitated until Xue Jing suggested dual roles: secret Yu Gang membership while continuing kills.

“Members receive bonuses too,” she added.

Eyes gleaming at monetary prospects, Second Only to Wolf agreed. “From now, I’m Yu Gang’s deputy. Inform your ranks.”

Guan Yu welcomed him, but when offered a measly 20,000 yuan, Second Only to Wolf balked. “This is beggar’s scraps!”

“Double the standard reward,” Guan Yu insisted.

“Keep your pennies!” Second Only to Wolf scoffed, just as Yang Conghan entered the ruined club, her gaze reproachful.
