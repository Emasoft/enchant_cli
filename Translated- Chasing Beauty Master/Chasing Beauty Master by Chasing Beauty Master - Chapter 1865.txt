**Chapter 4902: Reunion**

These past few days, Guan Yu—now known as Wan Hong—had been thoroughly enjoying himself in the capital with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. Though puzzled by the Qin family’s sudden silence and lack of action, he decided to seize this rare peace. He knew tranquility in the capital wouldn’t last long, so he indulged in leisurely outings with his two companions while he still could.

Today, Wan Hong lounged lazily, pampered from dawn. Even breakfast had been hand-fed to him. Qiqi, acting like a strict housekeeper, sat beside him while Wang Xiaorong held a large bowl of rice. With playful insistence, they’d claimed they’d care for him just as devotedly in his old age.

“Lord Wan Hong, where shall we go today?” Qiqi teased, feeding him a bite.

“Let’s visit the Red Rouge Theater,” Wan Hong replied. “It’s undergoing major renovations. Your insights would be valuable.”

“Perfect!” Qiqi clapped. “Since you own it, we *must* inspect our property!”

The theater now lay in ruins, swarmed by workers clearing debris. Du Teng, overseeing the reconstruction with skilled craftsmen, greeted Wan Hong warmly. “Brother Wan Hong! It’s been too long!”

Wang Xiaorong exchanged polite nods with Du Teng, while Qiqi boldly clung to Wan Hong’s arm. “Our relationship? Isn’t it obvious?” she declared, eliciting an awkward chuckle from Du Teng.

Wary of eavesdroppers, Wan Hong steered the conversation. “I thought you’d be assisting Little Mei at Red Name Mountain. What brings you here?”

“Merely checking the progress,” Du Teng said. “Materials are ready outside the city. Once the site is cleared, rebuilding will begin swiftly.”

As they adjourned to a nearby tavern, Chu Fan hobbled out of the theater, calling, “Wan Hong! Don’t leave yet—I need to speak with you later!”

**Chapter 4903: Rumors**

In the tavern’s private room, Du Teng grew serious. “Two matters. First, I humbly request more antidotes for the Blood Poison.” Wang Xiaorong handed him a small vial without hesitation.

“Second,” Du Teng lowered his voice, “the Cao family plans to kidnap Lady Jiang Xin to extort the Dragon Pearl of the East Sea from her father.”

Wan Hong stiffened. “Are you certain?”

“Rumors suggest Cao has allied with城外 outlaws to abduct her beyond the city walls. Whether the pearl remains with Jiang Yuanhai or the Emperor, Cao believes holding Jiang Xin will force their hand.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected coolly, “Greed blinds them. The pearl’s legend has stirred a frenzy. Even distant factions now probe its origins—including your ties to the Swordless Villa.”

Du Teng nodded. “Your alias ‘Wan Hong’ spreads far. Some trace the pearl’s trail back to the villa’s vaults. But the immediate threat is Cao’s plot.”

“I’ll warn Jiang Yuanhai,” Wan Hong vowed. “This chaos is my fault. I never imagined that cursed pearl would endanger her.”

As Du Teng departed for Red Name Mountain, Chu Fan urgently pulled Wan Hong aside at the theater. “Something’s wrong. I fear for Lady Jiang Xin’s safety.”

“The Cao family?”

Chu Fan shook his head. “Not just them. The pieces don’t fit. Why risk angering the imperial family unless…” He hesitated. “What if this is a larger scheme? The pearl’s allure may have entangled darker forces.”

Wan Hong’s jaw tightened. “I’ll visit the驸马’s estate tonight. Whatever the cost, Jiang Xin *must* be protected.”

Qiqi tugged his sleeve. “We’re coming too. You’ll need us when trouble strikes.”

Wang Xiaorong smiled faintly, her fingers brushing the hilt of her dagger. “Let them try. The Cao family will learn the price of greed.”

The capital’s fragile peace teetered as shadows of ambition and ancient treasure collided. Wan Hong, caught in the storm, prepared to confront the tempest—with his loyal companions at his side.
