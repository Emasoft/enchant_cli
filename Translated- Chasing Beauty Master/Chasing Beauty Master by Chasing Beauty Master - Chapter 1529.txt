**Chapter 3965: Display of Fortitude**

Within the imperial palace, Yu Kong wielded immense influence. As the emperor’s longtime eunuch attendant and chief steward, he also commanded the elite guard stationed in the Guang Palace. Under his decades-long leadership, this force had grown formidable, its reach extending throughout Jiangdu. They meddled in all affairs—both righteous and nefarious.

The emperor had long sought to suppress Yu Kong’s sprawling power, yet found no effective means. Most of the elite guard now consisted of martial arts masters recruited from the jianghu. Why Yu Kong sustained such a force remained a mystery. Some speculated rebellion, yet he remained obedient to the emperor. For now, despite the guard’s prowess, the old eunuch appeared docile, showing no overt signs of treachery.

Meanwhile, the Second Prince enjoyed the joint protection of Minister Qi’s Embroidered Uniform Guard. Thus, a fragile equilibrium held within the palace—neither faction dared provoke the other. As for which force reigned supreme, none could say. Though scheming constantly, the two sides had never clashed openly.

The Embroidered Uniform Guard’s might was undisputed, handling all major incidents in the capital with consummate skill. Yu Kong’s elite guard, while rumored fearsome, remained an enigma—their true strength and bluster yet untested.

**Chapter 3965: Display of Fortitude**

Now Prince Zou had become the target of both factions. The longstanding feud between the First and Second Princes paused as they tacitly united to eliminate him before he reached the capital. His audience with Emperor Huangshan must be prevented at all costs.

In truth, everyone knew the dull-witted First Prince cared little for such schemes. The real instigators were the Second Prince’s agents.

With Zou Wuya’s heroic sacrifice, the prince’s grief weighed heavily. Continuing this journey seemed impossible—interception and assassination loomed at every turn.

At dawn, Prince Zou stood in a roadside pavilion, gaze fixed on the horizon, face unreadable. Last night’s narrow escape, though costing Wuya’s life, had at least brought temporary safety.

Zou Wuhui, anguish etched on her features, pleaded, “Your Highness, since Elder Brother hasn’t arrived by now, the worst must have befallen him. I beg to retrieve his body—to grant him final peace rather than leave him to rot in the wilderness.”

Guanyu immediately countered, “Absolutely not. This isn’t heartlessness—we must depart swiftly. Our pursuers will soon descend. To go now is suicide.”

“Nonsense!” Wuhui retorted. “After last night’s assault and chase, they’ll be exhausted. The bamboo forest battle concluded with Your Highness’ escape—why would they linger?”

Though grateful for Guanyu’s rescue plan, Wuhui found him peculiar. The prince was right—this man’s bearing betrayed no commoner. He clearly hid his true identity. Yet since he meant no harm, perhaps he was simply a chivalrous stranger. No need to pry further.

Guanyu shook his head. “You’re mistaken. Last night’s fog caused chaotic attacks—they likely slew their own allies. Now the mist clears, they’ll redouble efforts to confirm Your Highness’ death. To return now is madness.”

The prince nodded. “Xiao Yu speaks wisely. Wuhui, though I yearn to honor Wuya, circumstances forbid it. He would understand.”

Wuya’s death devastated the prince—the boy he’d raised from childhood, now lost. A parent burying his child, yet he must maintain stoic composure, masking inner torment.

Guanyu and the prince’s logic crushed Wuhui’s final wish, fueling her resentment. Their behavior seemed increasingly suspicious.

“Your Highness,” Wuhui urged, “let us bypass the bamboo forest. Though longer, this route should be safer now that we’ve shaken pursuit. Speed is crucial—only in the capital will we find true safety.”

The prince agreed. After brief rest, they prepared to depart. When Guanyu’s group moved to follow, Wuhui blocked them.

“You needn’t accompany us further,” she declared. “We thank you for saving His Highness. Should opportunity arise, we’ll repay this debt. But fewer travelers move faster.”

Guanyu stiffened—after painstakingly infiltrating the prince’s retinue, now expulsion? Last night’s plan had required excessive sacrifices. A single rider with firecrackers could have created sufficient diversion. The mass casualties served only to thin the prince’s guard, creating openings for newcomers like themselves.

“You discard us like worn-out donkeys?” Wang Jun protested. “We risked everything for the prince! Now you cast us aside? Having made enemies, would we betray you?”

Xiao Zhi shrugged. “Let them go. Working in shadows might prove easier.”

Guanyu studied the wary Wuhui. “We aided you willingly, but if our presence discomforts His Highness, we’ll take our leave.” Mounting his horse, he gestured to depart.

“Wait!” The prince intervened. “We thank you again, gentlemen. But this perilous journey isn’t yours to share. Depart safely.”

Wang Jun smirked inwardly—the prince’s few remaining guards couldn’t possibly ensure safety. Yet to his surprise, the prince bid farewell with courtly grace, reframing Wuhui’s dismissal as concern for their welfare.

Guanyu bowed. “We appreciate Your Highness’ care. Farewell.”

**Chapter 3966: The Tea House**

After the trio left, the prince’s group took the forest bypass toward Lianzhou. By nightfall, Guanyu predicted they’d reach the city. “We’ll await them there,” he decided.

Exhausted from sleepless travel, the prince’s party paused at a roadside tea house. Only three customers occupied the sparse establishment—two laborers sharing wine, and a lone man in the corner.

“Two pots of tea,” Zou Wuxiao ordered, scanning the room. Reassured, the prince entered.

The proprietor fawned, “Sirs, freshly warmed wine if you’d like?”

Wuhui declined, ordering simple dishes instead. The prince invited all to dine together—a rare breach of protocol. “Henceforth,” he instructed, “address me as ‘Master,’ not ‘Your Highness.’ We travel exposed.”

As food arrived, Wuxiao slipped to the back, bribing the owner for wine. Gulping greedily, he ignored earlier prohibitions. The proprietor watched with strange satisfaction.

**Chapter 3967: Something Amiss**

“Where’s that companion of yours?” Wuhui asked when the owner returned.

“Saw no one,” the man lied smoothly.

Inside, Wuxiao guzzled from a heated jug. “Any flasks for travel?” he asked between swigs.

“Drink your fill here,” the owner urged, smile tightening.

As Wuxiao indulged, the proprietor served the prince’s table. Wuhui’s suspicions mounted—why hadn’t Wuxiao returned?

The prince’s group ate warily, unaware of the trap being sprung. The tea house’s stillness felt ominous, the proprietor’s demeanor increasingly unnatural. In the shadows, danger coiled—their fragile safety about to shatter.
