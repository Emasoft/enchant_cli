“Would he be cannon fodder?” Yang Long posed the crucial question. After all, the man was a coal mine owner – hardly foolish enough to become someone else’s sacrificial pawn. Usually, it should be the reverse.

“A nouveau riche with more money than sense,” Zhou Jin sneered, curling his lip. “He only wants to vent his anger. With someone offering assistance, he’d naturally accept. Who knows? He might even intend to use you as cannon fodder. Stay sharp – minimize our losses, but don’t hold back your resources. I won’t rest until he’s eliminated.”

Yang Long chuckled darkly. “I’ll handle it immediately.”

“Make it quick. Eliminate him en route,” Zhou Jin emphasized as Yang Long exited.

Left alone in his chair, Zhou Jin remained motionless, his face contemplative. Killing Guan Yu required catching him isolated. Today presented one opportunity. If unsuccessful... he might have to activate Chu Hong.

Zhou Jin sighed. Internal conflict was truly a last resort.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu found Niu Le still gambling downstairs with the 5 million yuan. Observing discreetly, Guan Yu refrained from using his powers – his objective achieved, further wins might arouse suspicion. Surprisingly, Niu Le’s luck held, netting modest gains.

“Let’s celebrate!” Niu Le insisted when Guan Yu proposed leaving.

Guan Yu frowned. Celebration here meant indulging in every vice imaginable – exactly why Niu Le frequented this den. Strangely, despite debauchery, Niu Le’s physique kept improving.

Tonight, Guan Yu couldn’t risk leaving his friend. With Chu Hong compromised, keeping Niu Le here invited danger. “We’re leaving,” he declared firmly.

As their car departed, a shadow followed.

“We’re being tailed,” Guan Yu announced. A gunshot shattered rear glass as Niu Le ducked. Five vehicles pursued, muzzles flashing in the dark.

Guan Yu activated gravity reduction – the Mercedes leapt forward like a rocket. “Call for backup!” he barked.

A tire exploded. The careening vehicle became a bullet-riddled sieve. “Jump on three!” Guan Yu commanded. Twin figures tumbled into night-shrouded grasslands as the wreck plowed into brush.

Bloodied but alive, Guan Yu ran – gravity-lightened strides eating distance. Warm blood seeped from arm and facial wounds. Behind, hunting parties mobilized with dogs and floodlights.

Yang Long circled the crash site, nostrils flaring. Warm blood on withered grass revealed his prey’s trail. “Bring the hounds,” he ordered via phone.

Guanyu crouched behind a berm, breath ragged. His exploration system scanned empty surroundings – temporary safety. Energy conservation dictated minimal wound treatment. Winter’s bite demanded preserved resources.

The recurring energy shortage frustration resurfaced. How he needed portable storage! But survival came first. After five minutes’ rest, he vanished into darkness – not fleeing prey now, but vengeful predator.

**Chapter 604: Checkmate**

Bloodhounds bayed where the trail went cold. “Spread out!” Yang Long ordered fifty men. “Two-man teams – converge on any contact!”

Unbeknownst, their quarry waited nearby, chocolate-fueled and lethal. Guan Yu’s eyes gleamed predatorily as first team entered his kilometer-wide sensory net. The hunt reversed.
