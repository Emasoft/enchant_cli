“I’ll follow your advice. In a couple of days, I’ll return to the desert to settle some matters and bring back a disciple. Otherwise, being here alone without any followers is too lonely,” Xiaomei said.

Guanyu nodded, thinking it wise. Bringing her disciples would facilitate communication and tasks. Only Xiaomei herself could make this trip, as others didn’t know the way.

“By the way, Guanyu, you’ve seen the structures on this mountain. What are your thoughts on their scale? Should we build something grander?” Xiaomei asked.

Guanyu sipped his tea, stood, and walked outside with Xiaomei following.

Surveying the area from the doorway, Guanyu envisioned this place becoming his stronghold. It needed grandeur, especially since financial constraints were no issue. Hoarding wealth served no purpose.

Pointing around, he declared, “Tear down all existing buildings. None shall remain.”

“Expand the boundaries,” he continued, gesturing. “Clear the trees near the summit to make space. As for architectural style and layout, I’m no expert—nor are you, I assume?”

Xiaomei nodded sheepishly. Since gaining human form, she’d only known desert tents, never grand structures.

Guanyu admitted his own limitations but insisted on expansion. “Our Jiayi Sect here must surpass even the most renowned martial manors. Plan for a thousand disciples. Grandeur is essential.”

“In a few days, I’ll find experts to design this,” he decided. “Red Mountain shall showcase our sect’s might and wealth.”

Xiaomei agreed. She’d been using nearby huts as storerooms, assuming they’d stay. Guanyu’s vision exceeded her own—a true sect headquarters demanded magnificence.

“We’ll await the designers and geomancers. This can’t be rushed,” she conceded.

Guanyu knew no architects personally but planned to recruit masters from the capital. Supervision during construction was crucial—neither he nor Xiaomei could manage this. He considered asking Xiao Zhi for help.

The mountain required complete transformation. Red Mountain’s broad slopes and gentle paths needed restructuring.

“Widen the main gate’s road to eight meters,” Guanyu outlined. “Three-meter stone steps on one side, smooth flagstones for carriages on the other. Develop rear mountain access too. This overhaul demands extensive labor.”

“So much remains,” Xiaomei sighed. “After my desert trip, we’ll commence construction upon my return.”

Guanyu approved. Financing posed no issue—Du Teng’s silver could procure quality materials and skilled workers from the capital. Red Mountain would be reborn.

“Did you come alone?” Xiaomei inquired. “Where’s your shadow, Siqi?”

“I’m investigating the Eight Drums Technique covertly in the capital,” Guanyu replied. “Solo mission under Master’s orders. Cloud Azure’s rules barred Siqi from joining.”

“You ditched her deliberately,” Xiaomei teased. “That girl would brave any danger for you.”

Guanyu denied this, citing sect discipline. He used this respite to finalize plans—his future base required meticulous preparation.

Meanwhile at Demon Soul Sect, Wang Xiaorong buzzed with restless energy. Learning of Guanyu’s return from Right Envoy, she’d resolved to visit Cloud Azure Mountain.

Demon Lord forbade it, citing dangers during Xiao Zhi’s wedding chaos. Only Right Envoy’s promise to monitor Guanyu’s movements calmed her—for now.

Chapter 4758: Easily Understood

The Demon Lord emerged rejuvenated from seclusion, only to frown at Right Envoy’s report.

“No trace of Eight Drums Technique?” he grumbled. “Impossible!”

Right Envoy detailed the苗城 expedition: battles with Red Lotus Sect, True Sun Sect’s futile searches, and the cryptic mural message.

“We interrogated the chieftain before execution—nothing. The verses ‘Longevity Birthday, Radiant Son of Heaven, Snow-Covered Golden Hall, Destiny Reveals Divine Technique’ were all we found.”

The Demon Lord stroked his beard. “Illogical. If苗城 held no technique, why new clues? It must exist!”

“Guanyu couldn’t have absorbed it undetected,” Right Envoy insisted. “Your detection artifact showed nothing.”

“Perhaps next year’s Ghost Festival...” she suggested, mentioning Guanyu’s bloodstone haul.

“I’ll lead the next expedition,” the Demon Lord decided. “This technique will be ours.”

Right Envoy voiced doubts about the clues’ authenticity, noting historical inconsistencies: no emperor had winter birthdays matching “Snow-Covered Golden Hall.”

“Whether false or not,” the Demon Lord ordered, “dispatch spies to the capital. Cloud Azure likely moves already.”

Chapter 4759: Unstoppable

The door slammed open. Wang Xiaorong marched in. “Father! Guanyu’s in the capital. I’m going!”

The Demon Lord sighed. Restraining his daughter was impossible—her loyal informers bypassed his orders.

Right Envoy cautioned, “Young Mistress, the capital’s anti-cultivator sentiment...”

“Pah! They’re just humans,” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “Left Envoy goes. Guanyu goes. I’ll suppress my aura!”

The Demon Lord exchanged resigned glances with Right Envoy. Once Wang Xiaorong fixated on Guanyu, no force in heaven or earth could stop her.
