“Uncle, this cup of wine serves as my apology to you and Aunt. Shilei not being able to accompany you during the New Year weighs on my conscience.” Guan Yu spoke with humble deference, embodying the model son-in-law’s attitude toward his wife’s parents, devoid of his previous domineering arrogance.

Liu Bingrong appeared flustered by the unexpected courtesy, his voice tinged with sycophantic laughter: “Old Guan…”

Before the words “Guan Laoda” could fully escape his lips, a subtle glare from Guan Yu silenced him, prompting an immediate shift in address: “Guan Yu, there’s no need for formalities between family. It was inevitable that our daughter would leave our side someday. I’m comforted that Shilei has found a man like you. I hope you’ll treat her well.”

“Absolutely,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. “If you encounter any business difficulties, Uncle, feel free to speak up. I’ll spare no effort to help you overcome them.”

“We’re family—no need for such courtesies. Your filial intentions alone suffice.” Though his words were polite, Liu Bingrong’s face bloomed with delight.

Though once intimidated by Guan Yu’s ruthless tactics and resolved to avoid provoking him, Liu Bingrong found it hard to let go of his admiration. Having such a capable, promising son-in-law brought him immense face—a sweetness he’d already tasted. During his hospitalization, Zhao Hu himself had visited, promising future assistance in M City. The envious gazes from those aware of Zhao Hu’s status made Liu Bingrong feel his past hardships were worthwhile.

“Families should support each other,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Yu… Yu-ge.” The terror of Guan Yu’s ruthlessness had etched itself into Liu Jie’s heart, leaving him instinctively fearful. His stammer transformed “Yu” into a suggestive homonym, drawing snickers from Lin Dong, who spat out his wine.

Liu Jie paled, trembling at his slip-up.

Guan Yu defused the tension: “As Shilei’s brother, you’re now mine. I won’t let anyone bully you. Youthful mistakes are forgivable, but refusing to change isn’t. As your elder brother, I’ll guide you. Do you mind?”

Deeply affected by recent ordeals under Chen Bao’s torment, Liu Jie nodded fervently: “Yu-ge, I’ll reform.”

Liu Shilei and Cheng Yufang watched in astonishment—had these wayward men truly reformed?

The meal concluded harmoniously. When Guan Yu again proposed taking Liu Shilei home for New Year’s, the formerly resistant Liu family eagerly agreed, even permitting her to stay out that night—a baffling shift that left Liu Shilei and her mother perplexed.

As the sole informed party, Lin Dong focused on eating. After the feast, he tactfully vacated the presidential suite, though Guan Yu declined—he refused to taint their intimacy with Lin Dong’s lingering presence.

Post-passion, Liu Shilei nestled against Guan Yu’s chest, tracing circles on his skin. Sensing his renewed arousal, she blushed but resisted: “How did you make my father and brother accept you?”

“After I share my truth, you’ll let me touch you freely tonight?” Guan Yu teased.

At her warning glare, he relented: “I’ve built a formidable organization in N City. I’m now a... respectable leader. Your family’s acceptance came after necessary interventions.”

Liu Shilei accepted his explanation, their bond deepening through heartfelt confessions and renewed passion.

The next day, Guan Yu returned home with Liu Shilei. His father, Guan Zhongfu, awaited eagerly. To everyone’s surprise, Liu Shilei turned out to be Zhang Xiao’s close friend—now her sister-in-law.

Amidst the joyous reunion, familial bonds strengthened. The story concluded with harmonious acceptance and shared laughter, as former friends navigated their new roles without drama—a testament to serendipity and mutual respect.
