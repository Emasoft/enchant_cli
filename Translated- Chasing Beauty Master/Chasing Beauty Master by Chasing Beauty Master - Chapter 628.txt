Evidently, someone in the demon realm had been effortlessly used as cannon fodder by their own precious son! Mu Bai gazed at Guan Yu, an inexplicable urge to protect her from harm arising in his heart—a sensation that deeply perplexed him. By all reasoning, he shouldn't know this person at all!

Murong Yuan strode directly before Ming Hanfeng, "This old minister greets the Queen Consort! Your Highness! I demand an explanation from Her Majesty!" Though performing the customary bow, not a trace of deference could be discerned in Murong Yuan's demeanor this time. His eyes even carried a hint of disdain! Moreover, his posture made it clear he wouldn't relent until Tian Huanyun punished Griffin!

In his heart, only his younger sister Murong Qian truly deserved to be the Netherworld's Queen Consort. As for the woman before him, the day would come when she'd meekly relinquish the throne! And he believed that day approached swiftly. As his gaze swept over Murong Yuan, Guan Yu immediately discerned the petty schemes swirling in his mind.

Just as Tian Huanyun opened her mouth to speak, Guan Yu cut her off with a cold laugh, "What explanation does Minister Murong seek?"

"Humph! You injured my daughter—you must pay the price! Sever one arm and I'll consider the matter closed!" Murong Yuan declared with self-important magnanimity.

"Murong Yuan! How dare you!" Ming Hanfeng pulled Guan Yu behind him, glaring furiously at the minister. Did this fool have a death wish? Demanding Yu'er sever her arm! If he sought demise, Ming Hanfeng would gladly assist. Guan Yu stepped out from behind Ming Hanfeng, her icy gaze fixed on Murong Yuan. "Sever an arm? Minister Murong's arrogance knows no bounds!"

"You harmed my daughter—retribution is inevitable!" Murong Yuan remained oblivious to her dangerous expression, still posturing arrogantly. With a sneer, Guan Yu turned to Akali Li. "Foster Father, what is the penalty for attempting to harm royalty?"

Caught off guard by her sudden question, Akali Li hesitated. "This..." Surrounding ministers frantically blinked warning signals at Murong Yuan, urging silence.

But the oblivious Murong Yuan stared haughtily at Guan Yu. "The punishment is death!" In his mind, she was merely a insignificant girl—no royal blood to threaten him. Little did he know this very declaration would seal his clan's doom. Hearing this, Guan Yu smiled with satisfaction. "Then you may die."

Tian Huanyun watched her daughter's imperious silhouette with proud tears—her child had truly matured. Ming Hanfeng and Ye Wuhen exchanged amused smiles, astonished by her cunning. Mu Bai gaped at Guan Yu, utterly flabbergasted by her audacity.

Murong Yuan's face paled. Could she be of royal lineage? Impossible! Murong Qian, realizing her brother had fallen into Guan Yu's trap, cried out in panic: "Brother!" She turned pleadingly to Akali Li. "Your Majesty, he meant no harm!" Murong Yuhan, currently healing Murong Siqi, could only nod weakly.

Guan Yu's glacial gaze swept over them, eyes glinting with mockery. "Not unintended? Then it was deliberate." Akali Li's face darkened as Guan Yu publicly humiliated him, yet he dared not interfere with her theatrics.

Provoked by Guan Yu's aggression, Murong Qian shrieked: "You harlot! You injured Siqi first!" Guan Yu's laughter rang cold. "So what? I warned that provoking me carries consequences!" Only then did Murong Qian sense the lethal aura radiating from this girl—an aura of death itself.

Finally, Akali Li's patience snapped. "Enough! Do you forget your king stands present?!" His thunderous roar startled Murong Qian into tearful silence.

Murong Yuhan ceased her healing efforts, pallid face beaded with sweat. Exhausting all her energy had barely stabilized Siqi's injuries. Now she could only glare hatefully at Guan Yu from behind Murong Yuan, wishing to slice the girl into a thousand pieces.

Guan Yu stared contemptuously at Akali Li. Did he think this feeble intervention would save the Murong family? She cared nothing for his posturing. Noticing her smirk, Akali Li's face purpled with rage. Suddenly, Guan Yu smiled cryptically—none could fathom her thoughts.

Slowly, she withdrew the Frost Flute, examining it thoughtfully. Murong Yuhan's eyes burned with covetous hunger—how her power would grow possessing this artifact! Catching that greedy gaze, Guan Yu's lips curled in disdain. The crowd buzzed with confusion—was she surrendering the flute?

Even Ye Wuhen frowned in puzzlement. Surrender? Impossible! Guan Yu smiled sweetly at Murong Yuan. "Shall we wager, Minister? Let's stake this Frost Flute."

Murong Yuan's eyes narrowed suspiciously. What scheme brewed here? But Ye Wuhen immediately grasped her intent—disaster loomed for the Murong clan. "What terms?" Despite misgivings, the flute's allure proved irresistible.

"A duel in three days." Guan Yu stated casually, as if arranging teatime. The crowd gasped—even Ming Hanfeng and his mother stared in shock.

"Done!" Murong Yuan agreed instantly. In his view, this "prince" whose talent supposedly plateaued below Earth尊 realm presented easy prey. How could he refuse heaven-sent fortune? Little did he know this decision would plunge his clan into eternal damnation. Akali Li sensed impending doom, yet couldn't articulate why.

As Murong Yuan accepted, Guan Yu's smile bloomed like a snow lotus on glacial peaks—dazzling yet deadly. "Victors deserve rewards... and losers?" Her next words froze the air: "Shall die."

Chapter 1597: A Stalemate

Meanwhile, Murong Fengyu went berserk seeing his disciple injured by Hu Tianhe, launching frenzied attacks at Wei Fenggu. The latter paled—he'd dismissed Fengyu as a novice界尊, but twin-elemental attacks proved terrifying! Though initially matched, Wei Fenggu now faltered. Desperate, he whistled skyward—a signal that made Fengyu's blood run cold. Guan Yu frowned—what was the old man summoning?

Soon, another界尊's aura erupted on the battlefield. Guan Yu's eyes widened—reinforcements! A hemp-robed man materialized. "Old Wei, why the urgent call?" Wei Fenggu gestured at Murong Fengyu. "Yiyuan, you'll find this one interesting."

Yiyuan's eyes lit up appraising the young界尊—unprecedented talent! Murong Fengyu tensed under the scrutiny of冥王山's strongest warrior, yet resolve hardened seeing Guan Yu's injuries. He couldn't fail her!

As Ling Chi's group formed protective ice barriers around Guan Yu, Tian Huanyun rushed over in distress. "Griffin! Does it hurt terribly?" Her maternal anxiety overflowed.

Guan Yu chuckled reassuringly. "Don't worry, Mother. I'm accustomed to pain." The trio froze—accustomed? What horrors had this child endured?

Unbeknownst to them, daily battles against Saint尊-level flame beasts in Death Abyss had forged Guan Yu's resilience. Hu Tianhe's strike barely grazed her—light magic already healed the damage while she feigned weakness to recover energy.

Hearts aching, the trio vowed to protect this scarred soul. Suddenly, Tian Huanyun turned pleading eyes to Hu Tianhe. "Luo Li, I beg you—spare them! They're your children!"

The crowd stirred—even beasts spared offspring! Yi Yuan and Wei Fenggu paused. Hu Tianhe's voice rang cold. "I have no rebellious sons." Tian Huanyun crumpled—how wrong she'd been!

Kong Lianxu retorted icily. "Nor do we have a father." Guan Yu sneered. "I was never your daughter—just an orphan you exploited!" The crowd's pitying gazes drew her wrath. "Save your pity! I want none!"

Ling Chi's group ached for their mistress—such anguish hidden beneath steel! As Tian Huanyun threw herself before Hu Tianhe, determined to die protecting her children, the king's eyes flickered with concealed anguish.

"Then trample my corpse first!" Tian Huanyun's defiance met stony silence. Ling Chi's faction closed ranks around Guan Yu, their loyalty absolute. Moved by this unprecedented support, Guan Yu whispered, "Thank you."

Jue stared—the ice queen never thanked anyone! "You're our liege!" they chorused, voices echoing across the arena. "We pledge eternal fealty!"

A cold voice cut through: "Well said!" Guan Yu's eyes brightened—he'd awakened!

The Soulsnare Whip at her waist suddenly levitated, ancient runes blazing. The crowd gaped—how could a mere spirit artifact emit Heavenly尊-level energy? As confusion reigned, a figure materialized beside the whip—an eerily beautiful man smiling at Guan Yu.

"Guan Yu, I've returned."

Though his appearance changed, she recognized him instantly. "Welcome back, Hu Xiaohai!" Their grins mirrored each other—the invincible duo reunited!

Zhang Wuhen abruptly interposed himself, glaring at the newcomer. "Who are you?"

Guan Yu's smile faded. "My partner, Hu Xiaohai."

"Partner?" Zhang Wuhen frowned. Hu Xiaohai smirked. "The best partners." His gaze held proprietary pride.

Whirling towards Hu Tianhe, Hu Xiaohai unleashed primordial pressure that staggered the king. Guan Yu chuckled—only he would mock three界尊s! "Injure her?" They sneered in unison. "You're unworthy!"

The crowd reeled at their audacity. Enraged, Wei Fenggu launched an attack. Guan Yu tensed, but Hu Xiaohai scoffed. "Recall how we felled Saint尊 beasts?" Confidence restored, she grinned.

As the wooden elemental sphere exploded, gouging a crater, Guan Yu vowed silently: I'll surpass you all.

Zhang Wuhen watched their synergy with bitter envy—he'd become her sole protector! Meanwhile, Yi Yuan trembled with excitement—an ancient dire beast! This battle proved worth the journey!

Chapter 1598: New Alliance

Hu Xiaohai twirled the whip, his demonic beauty mesmerizing. "Who dares touch her?" The crowd buzzed—a living artifact spirit? Impossible!

Grasping the Soulsnare Whip, he faced the enemies. "Try me." His challenge hung in the air as elemental energies crackled—the real battle now began.
