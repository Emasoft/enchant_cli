Grandfather Lu nodded. “That’s essentially correct. The swordflight technique forms the foundational principle of our Yunqing Sect’s arcane arts. Of course, other sects’ cultivation methods each possess their own utilities and logics. The myriad transformations of this world are unpredictable – even I cannot claim full understanding of them.”

Guanyu pondered: if his internal cultivation had been completely sealed, could he still practice spellcraft? If he attempted cultivation, would the techniques be devoured by these seals? Perhaps advancing his magical arts might even shatter the mental shackles binding him. These possibilities seemed increasingly plausible.

A spark of excitement ignited within Guanyu. “Grandfather Lu,” he inquired, “the arcane arts of your Yunqing Mountain have never been transmitted to outsiders, correct?” His true intention lay in testing whether he might gain access to these coveted techniques.

Grandfather Lu studied the young man. Having long contemplated retaining Guanyu’s presence, the elder seized this opening. “Indeed,” he affirmed, “only those who become formal disciples of our Yunqing Sect may cultivate our methods.”

“Can one simultaneously cultivate magical arts and internal energy?” Guanyu pressed.

The old master shook his head. “What you describe is called Dual Cultivation of Magic and Martial Arts – an impossibility. Each person possesses but a single dantian. Those cultivating spellcraft transform this energy sea into a reservoir of spiritual power, while martial practitioners strengthen the dantian itself. These two paths are fundamentally incompatible.”

Guanyu’s expression fell. It seemed he had indulged in unrealistic fantasies.

“However,” Grandfather Lu continued, stroking his beard, “the founding patriarch of our Yunqing Sect was precisely such a Dual Cultivation master – the only successful case ever recorded. Since his era, none have replicated this feat.”

“So it’s possible? Someone actually succeeded?” Guanyu’s interest reignited. Recognizing the youth’s intent, the elder saw his chance – binding a potential World Sovereign expert to their sect, should those mental seals ever break, would bring incalculable advantages.

Chapter 3104: No Great Matter

“Guanyu,” Grandfather Lu proposed, “your fascination with our arts is evident. Should you consent to enter my tutelage, I could impart the essential mantras immediately.”

Temptation warred with caution. Guanyu understood sect affiliations carried burdens – restricted movements, vows against betrayal, obligations to oppose demonic cults. “I appreciate your kindness,” he declined after consideration, “but freedom suits my nature. Great power brings greater responsibilities I’m unprepared to bear.”

The elder recalibrated. Retaining this prodigy justified bending rules. “Consider this compromise: learn Yunqing Mountain’s arts without formal discipleship’s constraints. The critical question remains – can your sealed physique even cultivate magic?”

“Truly?” Guanyu’s eyes lit up. “No sect restrictions? This is splendid!” Enhancing his capabilities without shackles seemed ideal.

“I must consult our Sect Master for final approval. You’d need nominal disciple status – non-negotiable.”

“A mere title? That’s acceptable.” Guanyu grinned. “When do we meet this senior of yours?”

“Dawn tomorrow. Rest here tonight.”

As they retired, Guanyu marveled at his potential fortune. If this elder possessed such power, the Sect Master might even unravel his cursed seals.

Returning to quarters, Guanyu sought to update Xue Jing but found no cellular signal. “Second Brother,” he summoned his companion, “take my phone downmountain to contact her.”

The Wolf King materialized abruptly, startling Guanyu into dropping his device. The screen shattered spectacularly against stone flooring.

“Damnation! Must you haunt like a specter?” Guanyu cursed, retrieving the ruined phone. “Look at this wreckage!”

“Frightened as a virgin bride?” The warrior scoffed, leaning on his greatsword. “Your trembling hands caused this – blame not my noble bearing.”

After futile arguments, Guanyu borrowed Lin Qiaoqiao’s phone, dispatching his companion on the errand. Dinner arrangements sparked further drama as the willful young mistress refused solitary lodging.

“I’ll perish from terror alone! Either Guanyu accompanies me or none shall sleep!” she declared, crimson-cheeked yet defiant when her cousin exposed her true intent.

Chapter 3105: Loss of Face

At dawn, Ma Xiao delivered summons. “The Sect Master awaits after breakfast.”

“Understood.” Guanyu turned to his skeptical companion. “You disapprove?”

The Wolf King frowned. “Martial and mystical cultivation risks bodily destruction – like walking between erupting volcanoes. Reconsider this path.”

Guanyu shrugged. “My empty dantian presents unique circumstances. Perhaps magic will unlock what martial arts cannot.”

As they debated, Lin Qiaoqiao clung to his arm. “Must you risk this? Current safety suffices!”

“My decision stands,” Guanyu asserted. To his shadow he declared, “No covert escorts – a World Sovereign needs no nursemaids. Appearances matter.”

Chapter 3106: The Exception

Grandfather Lu escorted Guanyu across breathtaking vistas toward Tiger Head Peak. The floating central platform’s vertiginous drop chilled Guanyu’s blood. “Why must we traverse this death trap?”

“Tradition demands it,” the elder chuckled, guiding them onto the mile-long Tiger Head Bridge. “None fly to the Sect Master’s domain. You’re the first outsider privileged to walk this path.”

As they progressed through swirling mists, the bridge’s arcane construction hummed beneath their feet. Guanyu marveled at floating stonework defying mortal physics. “Your patriarchs built wonders!”

“Legends say these peaks were battlefields of godlike immortals,” Grandfather Lu mused. “Our sect merely inherited their remnants.”

Approaching the bridge’s zenith, Guanyu sensed spatial distortions. The elder whispered conspiratorially, “What none know... exceptions exist. Observe.” With a subtle gesture, their footsteps began glowing – the first steps toward unraveling millennia-old secrets.
