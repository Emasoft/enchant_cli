“Never mind, we’re definitely taking you to Imperial Glory today. If you come to M Province without experiencing Imperial Glory, you’re practically a country bumpkin.”

Indeed, Imperial Glory stood as the totem of nightlife here—a realm where boundaries between night and day dissolved, time lost meaning, and endless revelry reigned supreme.

Though early in its peak operating hours, Juele Bar already thrummed at maximum intensity, fueled by regular patrons and newcomers drawn by its reputation. The air was thick with the mingling scents of alcohol and hormones. The DJ cranked the volume to deafening levels as men and women gyrated wildly in the strobe-lit dance floor. Fashionably aloof women laughed coquettishly among clusters of men, their provocative banter teasing those who struggled for self-control. At the bar, sultry women nestled in men’s arms exchanging whispered intimacies, while their partners drank and flirted shamelessly.

Seated alone at a table, Guan Yu sipped his drink, observing the crowd’s unrestrained indulgence. Here, beneath alcohol’s spell and hormonal surges, societal masks fell away—every soul became primal, dancing and singing to shed daylight sorrows.

He’d intended only to rest briefly, but his attention snagged on an unusual woman. Unlike others who pretended to sip cocktails while scanning for prospects, this woman in her early twenties had sat alone at the bar for hours, drinking steadily without glancing up.

*A woman with secrets*, Guan Yu mused, studying her through the haze. Jet-black hair cascaded over her shoulders. Her sky-blue chiffon blouse with lotus-leaf sleeves paired with a knee-length floral skirt revealed porcelain legs ending in black flats. Beneath her bangs, delicate brows furrowed above a flushed, exquisite face steeped in intoxication.

As Guan Yu observed, a weasel-faced man sidled up, following his gaze with a leer. “Buddy, been eyeing that chick forever. Why not make a move?”

“She’s pretty with a killer figure,” the man snickered, “but I prefer more…ample curves. Better handfuls.”

Guan Yu frowned at the lecherous commentary—typical bar camaraderie where men presumed shared vulgar interests. This was Hou Jinshun, the bar’s notoriously perverted bartender whose respectable name clashed with his repugnant persona.

“For ample curves, a sow might suit you,” Guan Yu retorted dryly, playing along.

“Heh, sows have their merits—all that blubber’s gotta feel great. When I’m in the mood, nothing stops me.”

Guan Yu’s estimation of humanity’s bottom sank further.

“Look, if you won’t hit on her, I will. Don’t get jealous,” the man urged, cracking his knuckles.

“You?” Guan Yu eyed his scrawny frame. “How many days you got left before you drop dead?”

“Tch, women don’t appreciate quality. In Japan, they’d be all over me!”

Guan Yu tuned out the braggart. His interest in the woman was fleeting—no desire to engage. Yet as they spoke, a booze-reeking hoodlum staggered toward her.

“Lonely drinking, babe? Let me buy you one,” the man grinned, yellowed teeth bared.

She lifted glassy eyes, squinting. “Sure.”

As she resumed drinking, the man’s gaze raked her body like a starved wolf. He licked his lips and shoved aside a nearby youth.

“Who—? Oh.” The youth paled upon recognizing the thug and fled.

“Deep Sea Bomb shots—on me for the lady!” the thug barked, plopping beside her.

Guan Yu’s brow twitched. *Since when do I play hero?*

“Tough luck, mate,” the weasel-faced man patted Guan Yu’s shoulder. “That’s Lao Dao—notorious gangster. Once crippled a guy over nothing. Runs with the bar owner. Don’t cross him.”

Surprised by the man’s intel, Guan Yu reassessed him—more than just a lecher.

At the bar, Lao Dao groped the woman’s hand. “Party at my place after?”

She jerked free, slurring, “Who’re you? Ugly creep—get lost!”

The thug’s grin vanished. “I bought drinks—you owe me.” He yanked her arm.

“All men are trash!” she shrieked, thrashing as the bar hushed.

Humiliated before the crowd, Lao Dao roared, “Bitch, you’ll pay tonight!” He dragged her toward the exit.

*Crash!* A beer bottle shattered against his skull. The woman stared horrified at the bloody shards.

Lao Dao touched his head, disbelief turning to rage. “You’re dead!” He swung a chair at her head.

The crowd buzzed with morbid excitement. Bouncers watched indifferently.

*Thud!*

Gasps erupted as Guan Yu materialized, chair caught mid-swing, his kick sending Lao Dao flying across smashed tables.

“You okay?” Guan Yu asked gently.

The woman trembled, then collapsed against him. Catching her, he felt her soft warmth—and the weight of trouble.

“Dude, run!” The weasel-faced man tugged Guan Yu toward the exit. Carrying the unconscious woman, Guan Yu followed.

“Stop them!” Bouncers lunged, slamming shut the metal gates.

Trapped, Guan Yu sighed. *Should’ve teleported…*

“You’ve really stepped in it,” his companion muttered as guards surrounded them.

A portly man descended the stairs—San Yan, the owner. The crowd parted.

“Bro-in-law!” The weasel-faced man approached, shocking Guan Yu.

“Jinshun? Explain.” San Yan’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.

“Just a misunderstanding. My friend here got carried away—”

“Your ‘friend’ assaulted Lao Dao. You know the rules.”

As tensions mounted, Guan Yu gauged the room. If diplomacy failed, this den would learn why some storms leave only rubble.
