“So, you already had a girlfriend but pretended to be Qiaoqiao’s boyfriend? What about the martial arts tournament to choose a husband?” Auntie exclaimed in surprise.

Qiaoqiao sighed, “Auntie, stop interrogating us! I did this for my own happiness. If Guan Yu hadn’t won the tournament, I’d have been forced to marry that beast Li Gui. My entire life would’ve been ruined!”

“Do your parents know about this arrangement?” Auntie pressed.

Lin Qiaoqiao shook her head. “They only know half the story.” At this vague answer, Auntie frowned but chose not to pry further.

Xiao Zhu, however, couldn’t resist. “Cousin, what do you mean ‘half the story’?”

“My parents know Guan Yu has other women in his life, but they think our relationship is real. They don’t realize we’re acting,” Qiaoqiao explained.

Auntie nodded understandingly. The Lin family, steeped in traditional values, saw polygamy as normal for powerful men. Thus, Guan Yu’s situation wouldn’t shock them. Still, Auntie noticed Qiaoqiao’s genuine feelings for Guan Yu, while his intentions remained unclear.

Xiao Zhu suddenly hopped off her chair and circled Guan Yu, scrutinizing him.

“Why are you staring?” Guan Yu asked uncomfortably.

“Fake brother-in-law!” Xiao Zhu giggled. “This is perfect!”

Auntie yanked her back. “Enough! How dare you speak so rudely!”

“But it’s true!” Xiao Zhu protested. “If he’s fake, maybe I can marry him!”

“Silence!” Auntie snapped. “Another word, and I’ll throw you outside!”

Terrified, Xiao Zhu clamped her hands over her mouth, eyes brimming with tears.

Qiaoqiao hung her head, heart heavy. She wished this charade could last forever—even as a pretense, being Guan Yu’s “girlfriend” was enough. Returning to City A meant the act would end, stripping her of excuses to linger near him.

Noticing her niece’s sorrow, Auntie softened. “At least Guan Yu protected you from worse fates. What’s next for you two?”

Guan Yu spoke calmly, “I don’t plan life rigidly. Being with Qiaoqiao has been joyful. Even back in City A, we can continue this act.”

Qiaoqiao’s cheeks flushed—his words felt like a promise. Everyone saw her love for him, and Guan Yu, too, seemed unwilling to let go.

“I wish you happiness,” Auntie said warmly. “You make a lovely pair.”

“Uh-oh, fake brother-in-law’s becoming real!” Xiao Zhu whispered, ducking her head when her mother glared.

Qiaoqiao suddenly pouted playfully, “Why congratulate me? Guan Yu’s home is full of stunning beauties! Where’s my happiness in that?”

“Really?” Auntie and Uncle gasped in unison, the latter with poorly concealed envy.

Xiao Zhu chimed in, “So you don’t want him, cousin?”

“Of course I do!” Qiaoqiao retorted.

Uncle leaned forward eagerly. “Guan Yu, is it true? Those unmatched beauties…”

“Exaggerated rumors,” Guan Yu deflected. “We’re close friends sharing a home. Nothing scandalous.”

Auntie seized Uncle’s ear, twisting sharply. “What’s that envious tone? Want a harem yourself?”

“Mercy!” he yelped. “I’m just curious!”

“Curiosity? Shameless!” Auntie berated as the others laughed.

Later, Guan Yu sought Second Brother Wolf outdoors. The mercenary gazed at mist-shrouded peaks. “You’re certain about cultivating magic? If your seal breaks, your qi and magic energies could clash… destroying you.”

Guan Yu nodded grimly. “Without power, I can’t protect anyone. Even if the seal holds, I need strength.”

“Have you told the girls in Qiaoyuan District?”

“Not yet. Xue Jing would panic.” Guan Yu sighed. “But I can’t hide behind others forever. Patriarch Yang grows stronger—Jinhua hides in shadows, fearing him. I must change that.”

Second Brother Wolf gripped his shoulder. “I’ll stand by you, brother. But tread carefully.”

As night deepened, Guan Yu prepared to call Xue Jing. Qiaoqiao intercepted him shyly: “Xiao Zhu and I… we’re scared alone. Stay in our room tonight.”

He agreed, unaware of the emotional tempests awaiting—both in love and the treacherous path of dual cultivation.

The mountain village glowed peacefully below, freed from monsters. Yet storms brewed in Guan Yu’s heart—and the looming shadow of Patriarch Yang’s power.
