“Chen Laida stared at the phone screen, nodding repeatedly, then said, ‘Your fates are now in your parents’ hands.’”

After speaking, he pressed the send button, transmitting the photo destined to throw the police station into chaos—one copy for the police, another for the six hostages’ parents.

Once confirming everyone had received it, Chen Laida sighed in relief. “Now we wait for good news. You all go relieve the brothers on deck so they can catch their breath.”

With his orders given, he leisurely sipped red wine.

While his days were relaxed, the police station erupted into turmoil.

They’d received the photos but hadn’t anticipated hostages aboard the yacht. Before they could verify the six hostages’ identities, their parents flooded the station with calls.

Now, the six identities were confirmed, but Jia Ren’s heart, liver, spleen, kidneys—and even his balls—ached with dread!

Especially his balls. They throbbed terribly.

These six had extraordinary connections. Two were closely related to the mayor, while the others’ backgrounds surfaced: two were heirs to L City’s top enterprises, and two were descendants of high-ranking officials. If any came to harm, Jia Ren would face dire consequences.

Jia Ren scowled at the transmitted photo, racking his brain for a solution.

Time was short. When Chen Laida sent the photo, he’d demanded the police release his men and exchange hostages once they reached international waters.

Jia Ren distrusted criminals’ promises. By the time they fled to open sea, night would fall, and rescuing the six would prove nearly impossible.

Reluctant to compromise yet desperate to save the hostages, Jia Ren sought a middle ground.

Amid his turmoil, Guan Yu and Xiao Xiong argued nearby.

“Guan Yu, you can’t go. That ship’s an armory. Charging in alone’s suicide!” Xiao Xiong growled.

Earlier, Guan Yu had proposed infiltrating the Haifeng solo. Xiao Xiong balked.

“I must go,” Guan Yu insisted.

Xiao Xiong refused. “At worst, we lose Chengui’s trail. But your life’s irreplaceable. I won’t let you risk it.”

“But my friend’s aboard. I have to save her,” Guan Yu countered.

“Leave rescues to the police.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Trust me. If I infiltrate, we’ll have a better shot. I don’t gamble with my life.”

Xiao Xiong relented, securing a helicopter from Jia Ren to drop Guan Yu onto the Haifeng.

The helicopter hovered above the ship. Guan Yu glanced down. “Time to shine, little one.”

**Chapter 643: Solo Infiltration**

Chen Laida gave the police ten minutes. Guan Yu had to rescue the hostages within that window—or all lives would be lost.

**Chapter 644: Direct Assault**

A seasoned fighter rolled across the deck, dodging bullets until sheltering behind a pillar.

**Chapter 645: Life-or-Death Rescue**

Even stoic parents faltered seeing their children’s peril. Mayor Mo Xiong pleaded: “Give me twenty minutes!”

Chen threatened: “Chop three fingers.”

Mo Xiong bargained: “Twenty minutes. That’s my limit.”

Chen sneered: “Five minutes per finger. Then toes. Until I’m safe.”

A henchman raised a knife.

“No!” Mo Ling shielded her cousin.

Gunfire erupted.

A bullet obliterated the henchman’s head.

Another shattered the communication screen.

Guan宇 stood framed in the doorway.

The room froze.

“Don’t shoot!” Chen ordered—a venomous spider clung to his neck.

The black widow’s bite meant death.

“Move, and you die,” Guan Yu warned.

Chen hissed: “Kill me, and they die too!”

Guan宇 shrugged. “Your bosses failed to kill me. You think you can?”

Chen’s eyes widened.

“You’ll die here!” Chen pressed a detonator.

Explosions rocked the ship.

“Out! NOW!” Guan宇 roared.

Flames engulfed them as the hull cracked.

“HOLD HANDS! DON’T LET GO!”

They plunged into frigid darkness.

**Chapter 646: Desperate Survival**

The sinking ship’s icy waters tested them.

Guan宇 rallied the group: “Hold on! Survive!”

They linked hands, battling hypothermia and despair.

One girl faltered.

Guan宇 channeled healing energy through her chest.

“Swim up when the hull breaks!”

They clung together, ascending through burning debris.

Survival hung by a thread.
