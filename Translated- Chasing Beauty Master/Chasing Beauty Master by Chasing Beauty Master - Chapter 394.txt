“Hmph!” Guan Yu snorted coldly, saying nothing as he directly called Li Xi and Lin Dong. “Do something for me – buy out Beijing Liwei Industrial immediately.”

Though still angry with him, Li Xi didn’t ask questions given his grave tone and set to work immediately.

Within half an hour, Liu Yunwei’s phone rang. Moments after hanging up, his teeth ground audibly. “How did you do this?”

Though Liwei Industrial was registered under their names as chairman and CEO, the legal representative was another person. The caller had simply stated the company was sold – through contract signing, they now belonged to Guan Yu.

“None of your concern! If I’m not mistaken, you’re now our company employees. Welcome aboard!” Guan Yu chuckled before suddenly roaring, “Tomorrow, all of you report to clean the offices!”

Humiliation, sheer and unadulterated! Even as Guan Yu’s employees, they were still Liu family scions and Wenqing’s uncles – being ordered to scrub floors was unconscionable!

“We quit!”

“Quit?” Guan Yu sneered. “You think resigning from my company is that simple? Fine – pay 5 million compensation each!”

5 million! These two weren’t worth half that sum. Their only value lay in being Old Liu’s sons and the Public Security Bureau Chief’s brothers. Otherwise, Han Yazhi and Li Yuanyuan – those spendthrift women – wouldn’t have eyed the measly 50,000-yuan medical staff salaries.

Watching their stunned expressions, Guan Yu said coolly, “You thought Grandpa Liu’s reputation and the Liu family’s influence could substitute for actual capability? Useless gluttons like you would’ve been sold out while counting cash for your betrayers! Your ‘partner’ immediately accepted our higher offer and exposed all your dirty dealings. Did you truly believe he’d share hardships with you?”

Li Xi’s message had revealed everything – their collaborator had only used the Liu name for profiteering. These fools thought they’d found allies, not realizing they were being used as pawns.

Now, Liu Yunwei and Liu Yunli slumped in their seats, utterly defeated.

“As for you two!” Guan Yu pointed at Han Yazhi and Li Yuanyuan. “I’ll give you easy work – care for the old man. I’ll pay 10,000 monthly.”

“No! I’m Madam Liu!” Li Yuanyuan shrieked like a madwoman. Having married Liu Yunwei for comfort, she refused to become a servant.

“Refuse? Then explain how you’ll cover your gambling father’s debts!” With his investigative system, Guan Yu had uncovered all their secrets.

“But 10,000 is too little!” Han Yazhi protested. She’d accept caring for the Liu patriarch, but 5,000 each couldn’t cover her cosmetics.

“Too little? Professional nurses cost 3,000. If you can’t manage with 5,000 each, you’re useless!” Guan Yu’s icy tone made their knees buckle into silence.

“Remember – if Grandpa suffers any harm, you’ll all be scrubbing company toilets!”

As Guan Yu sat drinking with the old man, the stunned Liu household absorbed these shocking developments.

The Lius had assumed Guan Yu was some backwater pauper – his plain clothes showed no wealth. Yet unbelievably, he’d acquired the Liu brothers’ company with one call!

Chapter 987: Beating You Is Lenient

Though this only proved Guan Yu’s wealth, the speed of acquisition hinted at formidable connections, temporarily quelling Liu Yunwei and Liu Yunjie’s resistance.

Some remained unimpressed – like Li Bing.

Clearing his throat, Li Bing interjected, “Aren’t you overstepping? These are your elders and Wenqing’s uncles! Have you considered her feelings?”

His concern wasn’t for the Lius but Wenqing herself – compared to Liu Wenwen’s flashy beauty, Wenqing’s pure charm outshone her like a swan beside a duckling.

“How I treat my wife needs your input? Since when does ‘Xiaoqing’ come from your mouth?” Guan Yu sneered, having long seen through Li Bing’s designs. Not punching him earlier was mercy enough.

Li Bing’s face darkened. “Wenqing’s my sister-in-law! Those are my future in-laws – their business is mine! Money isn’t everything. I could bankrupt your company despite your purchase!”

“Try then...” Guan Yu rolled his eyes, then froze. “What did you say? My wife’s your sister-in-law? Fuck your mother!” A thunderous punch landed.

The blow gave Li Bing a black eye and bloody nose, shocking the crowd. After enduring earlier insults calmly, why strike now over “sister-in-law”?

They didn’t know Guan Yu detested anyone coveting his wife. Li Bing’s implication deserved worse – Guan Yu had shown restraint.

“Guards! Guards!” Li Bing howled like a stuck pig. Guan Yu sneered – was this really a military brat? Even Jiang Ziqi was better.

Two burly soldiers rushed in – Li Bing’s guards.

Guan Yu sighed – compared to this clown, even playboy Jiang Ziqi seemed admirable.

“Sir, explain this,” a lieutenant demanded.

Respecting soldiers, Guan Yu shrugged, “His mouth stank – I helped brush his teeth.”

The guards exchanged looks – they knew Li Bing’s character but were bound to protect the Li family’s sole heir.

“Come with us.”

“Young men, let this go for my sake,” Liu Jingguo interjected. He increasingly approved of Guan Yu’s principled flexibility, far surpassing his own sons.

The guards hesitated. They revered the former governor but feared Li Bing’s retaliation.

“Apologies, Elder Liu. We must take him but will report truthfully.”

Liu Jingguo roared at Liu Yunjie, “Fool! Call Old Li!”

“Dad, I’m not close with General Li. Different systems...” Liu Yunjie refused to help the man who’d demoted his brothers to janitors.

“Useless whelp!” The patriarch slammed the table as Wenqing and Liu Yunshu comforted him.

“Husband, say something! Grandpa’s distressed!”

“Alright, alright!” Touched by the concern, Guan Yu dropped pretense. “I’ll go after finishing this meal with Grandpa.”

“No! He’ll escape! Execute him!” Li Bing screeched.

Guan Yu laughed – who did this clown think he was?

As guards advanced, Guan Yu called Jiang Ziqi.

Meanwhile, Jiang Ziqi gaped upon hearing Guan Yu had struck Li Bing. “He’s always tangling with military brats!”

“What happened?” His father Jiang Shang inquired.

“Guan Yu hit Li Dao-shu’s coward son Li Bing. Guards want to arrest him.”

Chapter 988: Jiang Ziqi Isn’t My Backer

“Li Dao-shu? Handle it. Invite Guan Yu here sometime.” Jiang Shang’s interest was piqued.

At the Liu residence, guards watched incredulously as Guan Yu kept drinking with the patriarch. The Lius seethed – only Liu Yunjie remained pensive.

“Husband, will this...” Wenqing’s mother fretted.

“Mother, trust him,” Wenqing insisted.

When Jiang Ziqi arrived, Li Bing yelled, “Jiang! Help me crush this bastard!”

Instead, Jiang Ziqi punched Li Bing’s other eye. “Who’s his backer? Me.” To the guards: “Tell Li Dao-shu I’ll report his misuse of military personnel.”

“You hit me?!” Li Bing wailed.

“Hit you? Need reasons?” Guan Yu waved. “Get this trash out.”

“You call him ‘Young Master Guan’?!” Liu Yunjie’s glass clattered down.

As guards dragged him away, Guan Yu called, “Military cars aren’t safe!” Later, Li Bing’s brakes would mysteriously fail.

Back inside, Jiang Ziqi declined Liu Jingguo’s wine until Guan Yu insisted. The Liu family reeled – since when did the Jiang heir defer to this outsider?

The old patriarch smiled, sensing greater storms ahead.
