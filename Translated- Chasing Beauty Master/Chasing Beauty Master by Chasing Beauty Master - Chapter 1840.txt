“Reporting to Master, the incident at the Immortal’s Banquet Inn was caused by a server embezzling a hundred-tael silver note from a guest.”

“Explain this matter in detail,” Master Cao demanded, disbelieving two such incidents in one day could be mere accidents.

“A wealthy young master from out of town dined there today. He ordered all the finest dishes and wines, paying with a hundred-tael note. After the meal, when the server asked him to settle the bill, the guest refused, claiming he’d already paid. A dispute arose, and the missing silver note was found on the server. Enraged, the guest denounced us as a den of thieves, smashed the establishment, and left without paying. Other patrons, feeling cheated, also departed without settling their bills. Our losses are severe, and our reputation is ruined. This is a grave situation.”

“A young master from out of town? Who?” Master Cao mused aloud, immediately suspecting Wan Hong. “Was it that wretched Wan Hong?”

“No, Master. I’ve seen Wan Hong at the Red Charm Theater. This man was unfamiliar—neither him nor anyone we’ve encountered before. His origins are unknown.”

Master Cao slammed his fist. “How the hell did you train your subordinates? Even if stealing, couldn’t he be discreet? A mere server daring to pocket a hundred taels? The fool has a death wish!”

“Master, I believe the truth lies elsewhere,” the subordinate ventured cautiously. “This server has served me loyally for two years. He’s diligent, cheerful, and free of vices. He wouldn’t steal even a single tael, let alone a hundred. I suspect the guest framed him deliberately.”

“So it was deliberate,” Master Cao muttered darkly. “I knew today’s gambling hall incident wasn’t simple either. Someone is targeting the Cao family.”

“Send men immediately to investigate this man’s background!” Master Cao barked. “When I catch the bastard who dares sabotage my businesses, I’ll tear him limb from limb!”

Suddenly, he paled. “Quick! Send men to the fabric shop nearby! That scoundrel’s likely there now—stop him before more damage!”

“At once, Master!” The subordinate rushed out. A seasoned schemer himself, Master Cao knew today’s events—even if not Wan Hong’s doing—were undoubtedly linked to him. After Cao’s men had disrupted the Red Charm Theater, its owners Chu Fan and Wan Hong would seek revenge. This had to be their retaliation.

**Chapter 4835: You Get What You Pay For**

Unaware of Master Cao’s fury, Guan Yu arrived at the fabric shop. “I’m told you’re premier cloth merchants. As an out-of-town trader seeking partnerships, summon your manager.”

An elderly man in a pristine white gown soon appeared. Despite his years, he stood ramrod straight, his refined attire shedding a decade from his appearance—a walking advertisement for his wares.

“Young Master, I’m the manager. How may I assist?”

“Your reputation precedes you,” Guan Yu replied. “I require premium silks and embroidered fabrics for aristocratic clients. Quality is paramount, though pricing must remain reasonable.”

“Naturally. As the saying goes—you get what you pay for. Please inspect our wares.” The manager gestured toward the vast courtyard where colorful bolts dried under the harsh sun.

Noting a tall wooden pole beside a drying rack, Guan Yu discreetly placed a transparent gem atop it. The concentrated sunlight through the prism would soon ignite the flammable fabrics.

“These are satisfactory,” Guan Yu remarked, eyeing the setup. “For bulk orders, might we negotiate terms?”

“Certainly. The quoted prices are retail. Wholesale partnerships warrant discounts.”

“Excellent. I’ll return tomorrow with my employer to finalize.” With a courteous nod, Guan Yu departed—aware Cao’s men would soon descend.

**Chapter 4836: Inferno**

Moments after Guan Yu left, Cao’s soldiers stormed in. “Any troublemakers here?”

“None,” the puzzled manager replied. “All’s been quiet.”

“Stay vigilant,” the captain warned. “The gambling den and inn were attacked today. Master Cao suspects sabotage.”

Unnoticed, the gem’s focused rays had already smoldered the fabrics. Thick smoke soon billowed as flames engulfed the courtyard. Bucket brigades proved futile against the inferno—the entire stock vanished in ashes, neighboring buildings catching fire.

**Chapter 4837: Reckoning**

Back at Cao Manor, the patriarch raged. “Useless fools! Three businesses destroyed in a day, and you can’t even identify the culprit!”

Slapping a subordinate, he roared, “Was it Wan Hong? I’ll flay him alive!”

“The witnesses all describe the same refined young master,” quavered a fabric manager. “Though older than Wan Hong, their connection remains unclear.”

“I don’t care! Comb the capital! Find him!”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu—now changed—returned to the Red Charm Theater. Chu Fan eyed him suspiciously. “Was this your doing?”

Guan Yu smiled innocently. “How could I? Though whoever struck Cao deserves applause. Karma’s a fitting teacher.”

As Chu Fan pondered, the deputy manager mused, “Could it be the Li family reclaiming what Cao stole from them?”

The flames of retribution burned on.
