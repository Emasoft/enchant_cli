Rather than a desert, it was Miao City that had emerged. The Demon Lord encountered a half-demon within Miao City—a wolf clan demon whose power rivals even a Realm Sovereign. I presume this is news to you?

"Thus, I shall offer one final counsel. Killing me may incur no wrath from the Azure Cloud Sect. But should you harm her, prepare for the Demon Lord's endless vengeance. Her standing in his heart needs no elaboration."

The Swordless Immortal fell silent. His adversary spoke truth—the Demon Lord was not to be trifled with. A cunning and ruthless schemer, he would never relent if his daughter came to harm at Swordless Manor.

Moreover, the Demonic Soul Sect's influence now blazed like the midday sun. Even immortal cultivators would find eradicating Swordless Manor no arduous task.

Most notoriously, the Demon Lord commanded two formidable lieutenants—his Left and Right Envoys. These pillars of the Demonic Soul Sect could likely raze Swordless Manor single-handedly with their forces.

If so, this woman truly must not be offended. Yet the mention of Azure Cloud Sect... Could he be their disciple?

"Today proves most peculiar—four intruders including an Azure Cloud disciple and a demonic cultivator. Since when do righteous and demonic sects consort?" The Swordless Immortal frowned, perplexed.

Nor was he alone in confusion. After Guan Yu's declaration, Du Teng and Zhenxiang stared dumbfounded. When had Xiaorong become the Demon Lord's woman? Since when was Guan Yu an Azure Cloud disciple? Such revelations struck like thunder from clear skies.

Though visibly wary, the Swordless Immortal sneered, "You think these empty threats daunt me? A jest! None have ever cowed me. Your fates rest in my hands."

"What of the Demon Lord? Rest assured he'll never learn your demise here. My title as 'First Under Heaven' bears no falsehood."

Snatching Wang Xiaorong's hand crossbow, he examined the unfamiliar weapon before leveling it at her.

**Chapter 4159: Life-Preserving Measures**

Guan Yu's heart hammered in his throat. One twitch could unleash catastrophe.

"Now I understand why none leave this mountain," he shouted. "You ambush challengers with poison and trickery—how base!"

The crossbow swung toward Guan Yu. "You err. My title was earned through true strength, not hollow reputation. But you've learned too much to live."

Guan Yu's mind raced. If pushed, he'd resort to the Imperial Seal... or a pistol ambush when least expected.

"You trapped us with illusions at the gate, maze arrays in peach groves, venomous serpents, and now poison—all to kill mere admirers? Was this necessary?"

"Necessary? Trespassers deserve death. Only this intrigued me." He brandished the crossbow. "Explain its mechanism. My guards fell instantly to this silent killer—how?"

Guan Yu complied: "My invention—the hand crossbow. Fatal within fifty meters."

"Your creation?" Skepticism laced the Swordless Immortal's voice. "Then only you can produce more? Perhaps your life has value after all..."

"Others replicate it now. The Profound Light Sect enlists True Sun Sect's Elder Wang to mass-produce them. Soon they'll flood the martial world—though inferior to my prototypes."

"Does it require blood-binding? Spiritual energy? Where lies its essence?" The curiosity was palpable.

Meanwhile, Du Teng grappled with revelations—how could an Azure Cloud disciple and Demonic Soul heir unite? Yet the Swordless Immortal's fallen image consumed his thoughts, though sapped strength stayed his blade.

"Craftsmanship and rare materials determine potency," Guan Yu answered.

Nodding approval, the interrogator pressed on: "And earlier—what disrupted my serpent-controlling flute? That thunderous noise bore no relation to your weapon."

Guan Yu produced a pistol, racking its slide. "Another toy invention—loud but harmless."

**BANG! BANG!**

Echoes froze the room. The Swordless Immortal collapsed, twin shoulder wounds gushing. Guan Yu retrieved the crossbow, pistol trained on the fallen figure.

"Your poison neutralizes energy... but not these." His voice turned glacial. "Your calculations erred."

Gritting through pain, the defeated man rasped, "Well played... To think my first day as Swordless Immortal... would be my last..."

**Chapter 4160: True Face**

"First day? Explain!" Du Teng ripped off the golden mask—and gasped. Beneath lay a familiar face from Wujian Inn.

"You're no Swordless Immortal!" Guan Yu exclaimed. "You ascended the mountain before us!"

Du Teng recoiled. "Second Brother? Why impersonate him? Where's the true Swordless Immortal?"

The imposter coughed blood. "We four... challenged him... Others died... I struck as he weakened... Then discovered..."

As his breath faltered, desperate questions flew:

"How could you defeat the legendary Swordless Immortal?" Guan Yu pressed. "A Peak Realm Sovereign shouldn't fall so easily!"

"The truth..." The dying man's eyes glazed. "Visit the secret chamber... All becomes clear... Anyone... can become Swordless Immortal..."

With final twitches, silence fell.

"Check for antidotes!" Xiaorong urged. But searches proved futile—until Guan Yu spied a fleeing servant.

**Chapter 4162: Mountain of Treasures**

Tracking the servant revealed a stone door carved with battling beasts. As the lackey inserted a token, Guan Yu intercepted:

"I'll take it from here."

Alone before the engraved portal, he studied its central mystery—a faceless beast whose visage formed a keyhole-shaped depression...
