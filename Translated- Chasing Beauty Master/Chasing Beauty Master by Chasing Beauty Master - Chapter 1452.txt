“Guan Yu, could this be some misunderstanding? Or is Eldest Senior Brother being wrongfully accused?” Xiao Zhi asked with disbelief.

“It was Wang Xiaorong herself who told me. Think carefully—every time the Black-Furred Monster appeared, Eldest Senior Brother would also vanish. Isn’t that evidence enough?

At Black Blood Ridge, the salt marshes were always under the Blood Lord’s control. After we eradicated Black Blood Ridge, only the Demonic Soul Sect now possesses the antidote to suppress Blood Toxin. Once infected, this poison cannot be cured. Victims can only rely on the antidote to suppress its flare-ups.”

Guan Yu continued, “The Blood Lord created this toxin to control his subordinates. Those who betray him are denied the antidote. When the poison erupts, they transform into Black-Furred Monsters and perish within days, drained of their vital essence. This is no secret.

Yan Zhao may appear as Yunqing Sect’s Eldest Senior Brother, but in truth, he has long been a pawn of the Demonic Soul Sect, controlled by the Left Envoy.”

“I still can’t believe it. How could Eldest Senior Brother be part of the Demonic Soul Sect? There must be a misunderstanding. We must find him and demand an explanation.”

“You’re still blinded! He tried to silence me earlier and fled only when you arrived. If he’s innocent, why run?” Guan Yu pointed at the window.

Xiao Zhi argued, “Perhaps he has hidden struggles. If he truly suffers from Blood Toxin, why not confess to the sect? Maybe Sect Master Xuanming could cure him.”

**Chapter 3,783: Will You Trust Me?**

Guan Yu grew weary of arguing. Xiao Zhi’s mind, steeped in Yunqing Sect’s doctrines since childhood, refused to bend. Yan Zhao valued his reputation above all. Confessing his infection to Xuanming would risk imprisonment or execution, not salvation. Even if spared, his standing in the sect would crumble. Now exposed, Yan Zhao’s hatred for Guan Yu would drive him to retaliate.

Xiao Zhi slumped into a chair, overwhelmed. Returning to the sect to report everything seemed the only path forward.

Guan Yu approached, placing a hand on his shoulder. “This is the truth. If you doubt me, I’ll prove it.”

“Prove it? How? He’s already gone.”

“He’ll return to kill me. We’ll track him. By the next full moon, you’ll witness his monstrous transformation yourself.”

Xiao Zhi fell silent, torn between two trusted figures. “I need to clear my mind,” he muttered, leaving alone.

Guan Yu understood Xiao Zhi’s admiration for Yan Zhao. Time alone might bring clarity.

Though Xiao Zhi respected Guan Yu, his loyalty leaned toward Yan Zhao. He clung to the hope that his idol remained unchanged.

**Chapter 3,784: Unrepentant**

At a tavern, Xiao Zhi found Yan Zhao drinking heavily. “Eldest Senior Brother, tell me the truth. What’s happening?”

Yan Zhao tensed. “Do you also think me a traitor?”

“I don’t doubt you! Guan Yu accused you, but I need to hear your side.”

Slurring slightly, Yan Zhao asked, “Xiao Zhi, you’ve known me since childhood. Do you trust me?”

“Of course! You’re our role model.”

Yan Zhao stood, gripping his shoulder. “Then answer: Do you believe Guan Yu? His closeness to that demoness has clouded his judgment. How dare he slander me as a Demonic Soul spy! I’ve no reason to serve them.”

He then ranted about Wang Xiaorong’s betrayal, lamenting how exposure ruined his espionage. “Returning to the sect would doom me. Xuanming would discover my infection.”

Xiao Zhi urged, “Let’s seek Sect Master’s counsel. He’ll resolve this.”

“Fine,” Yan Zhao agreed, masking his scheming. “Rest tonight. We depart tomorrow.”

Xiao Zhi nodded, unaware of Yan Zhao’s plan to frame him. That night, Yan Zhao spiked Xiao Zhi’s medicine with his tainted blood, infecting him with Blood Toxin.

**Chapter 3,785: Shadowed Strike**

Days later, in Yunqing Sect’s Tiger Peak Hall, Yan Zhao denounced Guan Yu: “He allied with the demoness, killed Lord Lu, and seized the Flaming Stone for the Demonic Soul Sect!”

Sect Master Xuanming thundered, “Guan Yu disregards our laws! He’ll face severe punishment upon return.”

Xiao Zhi protested, “We saved Wang Xiaorong because she rescued us first! Lord Lu trapped us—”

“Silence!” Elder Zheng barked. “Demons deserve death, not collaboration!”

Yan Zhao feigned mercy. “Blame Guan Yu alone. Xiao Zhi merely followed.”

Xuanming ordered Xiao Zhi to confinement. As Xiao Zhi left, Yan Zhao ambushed him with a cursed peachwood artifact, triggering his Blood Toxin.

Xiao Zhi’s body erupted in agony—eyes crimson, black fur sprouting. His roar echoed as he collapsed, thrashing.

Yan Zhao watched coldly. *Forgive me, Xiao Zhi. But my survival requires your sacrifice.*
