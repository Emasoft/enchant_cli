They were oblivious to Guan Yu’s clear perception of Shigeru Hayakawa’s movements, mistakenly believing Guan Yu had merely guessed Hayakawa was attacking his position and thus relocated to Hayakawa’s previous spot—only to inadvertently end up behind him.

Hayakawa himself never imagined Guan Yu could track him. Thrusting his sword forward, whether striking true or not, he vanished once more, reappearing a foot to the right, now face-to-face with Guan Yu.

**Chapter 1730: Empty-Handed Blade Catch**

Yoko screamed in terror as she witnessed Hayakawa’s blade plunging toward Guan Yu’s chest, drawing disdainful glances from the crowd. She cared little for their judgment, consumed by fear for Guan Yu’s safety.

Her father, Takashi, patted her shoulder with a chuckle. “Your concern clouds your reason. Guan Yu was already a top-tier martial artist in China two decades ago, and after twenty years in the Divine Realm, how could he fall to a Second-Class Mutant? Relax—he’ll be fine.”

The First-Class Female Mutant behind Yoko added softly, “Lady Yoko, Hayakawa poses no threat to Guan Yu.”

Yoko nodded. “I know he’ll be safe… but I can’t help worrying. Father, what did you mean? ‘A top-tier martial artist twenty years ago’? Is Guan Yu… old?”

Takashi sighed inwardly. *As the saying goes, ‘A daughter’s heart leans outward.’ Here I am comforting her, yet she latches onto that single phrase!*

To Guan Yu, Hayakawa’s swordsmanship was child’s play. A slight sidestep caused the katana to whistle past his ribs.

Hayakawa stiffened in shock. Even First-Class Mutants struggled to evade that strike, yet this non-mutant had done so effortlessly.

Despite his confusion, Hayakawa pressed the assault. His blade arced downward toward Guan Yu’s crown, the swing slicing through air with a tremor that rippled the starlight. Spectators swayed as if intoxicated; ordinary folk without cultivation moaned, knees buckling.

“Magnificent!” Guan Yu applauded. “A blade technique fused with spiritual assault—vibrations distorting vision and judgment. This strike alone elevates you to master swordsman!”

Japanese kenjutsu prized speed and lethality, yet some masters had blended Chinese techniques into hybrid forms. Hayakawa’s move epitomized this fusion.

Though dazed by the sword’s aura, the crowd only registered the standoff when Guan Yu spoke: katana suspended three inches above his head.

Yoko bit her lip to stifle another scream, terrified of seeing bloodshed. Earlier, Hayakawa had vowed not to kill Guan Yu—at most incapacitating him for a month—yet now the blade descended unstoppably. He could only pray Guan Yu survived.

Gazing into Hayakawa’s eyes, Guan Yu murmured, “Strike with full force.”

*Does he seek death?* Hayakawa wondered, but hesitation vanished as steel met skull.

The crowd erupted in screams, anticipating gore. Yoko squeezed her eyes shut… yet no commotion followed. Peeking timidly, she gasped.

Both men stood frozen—the katana’s edge caught in Guan Yu’s bare left palm.

Hayakawa strained to reclaim his blade, face paling. “How…?”

With a smile, Guan Yu snapped the sword. The severed half melted like ice in his grip, molten droplets hissing on the ground.

Jaws dropped. Spectators echoed Hayakawa’s disbelief: “How?!”

Guan Yu’s voice softened. “The path of cultivation knows no limits. Second-Class, First-Class Mutants—before true power, you’re but ants. Your mutated forms unlock less than ten percent of human potential. What arrogance deems you supreme?”

Humiliated, Hayakawa collapsed. The audience—initially cheering for his victory—now jeered their countryman’s defeat.

“I respect Hayakawa’s honor in defeat,” Guan Yu roared at the hecklers. “But you cursing cowards—who among you dares face me?”

The mob recoiled. Guan Yu’s thunderous shout summoned a gale that flattened the boldest, sending them scrambling.

Approaching the vanquished, Yoko fretted, “Guan… will he die?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Violent? Hardly. He’ll gain tremendous benefit.”

As Yoko scoffed, Hayakawa moaned in unexpected ecstasy—his body reforged by golden energy Guan Yu had channeled into him.

“Pervert!” Yoko flushed, misinterpreting his sounds, and retreated to her car.

Three figures emerged from Hayakawa’s estate: a composed patriarch in traditional robes, his demure wife, and a teen resembling Hayakawa.

“Uncle Hayakawa,” Yoko bowed, cheeks pink. “Please don’t blame Guan. He didn’t—”

Patriarch Hayakawa Fuyuki raised a hand. “A duel of skill warrants no grudge. Moreover…” He bowed deeply to Guan Yu. “Master Guan Yu, forgive my son’s ignorance in challenging you.”

**Chapter 1731: Fortune from Misfortune**

Takashi queried the First-Class Mutant beside him: “Chiyuki, how does Guan Yu compare to Ito the War God?”

Chiyuki—the shadowy guardian named at last—pondered. “Unknowable. Before encountering Lord Ito, I believed myself peerless. Both he and Guan Yu radiate bottomless depth. For ants like us, gauging such beings is impossible.”

Takashi frowned. “But Guan used no flashy techniques.”

“Precisely why he terrifies,” Chiyuki countered. “No aura, effortless movements—true mastery.”

Nearby, Yoko beamed at Guan Yu’s praise, interjecting: “He’s the strongest! Even better than Ito!”

Takashi and Chiyuki exchanged resigned glances.

**Chapter 1732: The Divine Emperor’s Summons**

As the Hayakawas withdrew, Guan Yu’s challenge to Ito reverberated through live broadcasts—an unexpected twist for viewers anticipating a swift nationalist victory.

Later, golden energy searing his veins, Hayakawa knelt despite crowd jeers. “I insulted a true master. Are you… Guan Yu returned from the Divine Realm?”

Guan Yu raised him up, ignoring the xenophobic hecklers. His roar scattered the mob like leaves.

When only Yoko remained, the Hayakawa patriarch approached, acknowledging Guan Yu’s forbearance. The family’s dignity remained intact—no guards intervened, respecting the duel’s sanctity.

Yoko’s father chuckled, envisioning future alliances through his daughter’s match. Meanwhile, Hayakawa shuddered through transformative agony—Guan Yu’s “punishment” actually unlocking latent potential.

“Disgusting!” Yoko huffed at his moans, unaware of his metamorphosis.

As the estate gates closed, Guan Yu knew this victory was but a prelude. Ito the War God awaited—and through televised defiance, their clash became inevitable.
