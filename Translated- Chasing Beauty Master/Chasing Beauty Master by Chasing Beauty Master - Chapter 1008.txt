Xue Jing led Guan Yu directly out through the back gate of Houyuan Temple. This was the only path to the Five Rear Mountains, and the road leading uphill consisted of a single asphalt path that wound its way up to the halfway point of the rear mountain's slope.

The rear mountain stood as a towering peak behind Houyuan Mountain, its slopes precipitously steep. While the front face had this single paved path, the other three sides presented sheer cliffs. To the west roared an immense waterfall that cascaded thousands of feet downward.

By the time they had covered half the distance up the mountain, the thunderous roar of the western waterfall already filled the air.

Xue Jing supported Guan Yu as they ascended at a painstakingly slow pace. Though Feitianlang (Sky Soaring Wolf) constantly urged them from behind, the pair maintained their deliberate speed. Guan Yu complained weakly, "I have no strength left in me. This is as fast as I can manage. Stop rushing—we’re nearly there."

After what felt like an eternity, the asphalt path abruptly ended at a broad, leveled platform mid-slope, as if someone had intended to develop the area. The machine-flattened expanse extended to a narrow overgrown trail that continued upward.

The neglected path had nearly vanished under encroaching weeds. As Xue Jing helped Guan Yu struggle upward, Feitianlang’s impatience boiled over. "How much farther? When will we arrive?"

**Chapter 2577: The Small Cave**

"Patience. We’re almost there," Guan Yu replied hoarsely.

After fabricating numerous counterfeit treasure maps and scattering them about, Guan Yu had prepared this exact scenario—using decoys to mislead potential pursuers. The cave ahead indeed contained one such forgery. His plan was simple: if Feitianlang accepted the map and released them, the matter would end peacefully. But should the bandit attempt murder to conceal the treasure’s location, Guan Yu had instructed Xue Jing to be ready to strike.

Though he judged the likelihood of betrayal small, Guan Yu knew the adage "men die for wealth" held truth. Possessing the map, Feitianlang might eliminate witnesses to protect his claim. Caution was paramount.

As they inched forward, Xue Jing whispered irritably, "Why did you tell him I’m contagious? That was humiliating."

Guan Yu murmured back, "It was the only way to ensure he’d let you accompany me. Would you have trusted me to face him alone?"

When Feitianlang’s patience finally snapped, the pair halted. Guan Yu feigned exhaustion, gesturing weakly ahead. "The treasure map... it’s in that small cave. Retrieve it yourself."

Overcome by greed, Feitianlang threw caution aside and rushed forward. Behind a curtain of weeds lay a meter-high opening—easily overlooked unless one knew where to look.

"Fetch it for me!" Feitianlang commanded, eyeing Guan Yu suspiciously.

Guan Yu collapsed dramatically to the ground. "Look at me. Could I possibly crawl in? I can’t even stand. The entrance requires crawling—something I’m incapable of in this state."

Refusing to risk entering himself, Feitianlang turned to Xue Jing. "Then she goes. Now—or I slit your throats!"

Guan Yu shot him a withering look. "Use your brain! If this were a trap, why would I lead you halfway up a mountain? The map’s there—take it and be done!"

"Fool! How do I know it’s not ambush?" Feitianlang retorted. "You could flee while I’m inside!"

Guan Yu shook his head in mock despair. "Your brawn outweighs your brains. I’m poisoned by your own toxin—without the antidote, I’m crippled for life. Why would I sabotage you?"

Though the logic held, Feitianlang remained adamant. Xue Jing, petite and nimble, ducked into the cave.

**Inside the Cave**

Darkness enveloped Xue Jing as she entered, though faint light revealed a narrow passage widening after a dozen steps. Spiderwebs draped the walls, and the scuttle of rodents echoed in the damp air. Using her phone’s flashlight, she illuminated a five-square-meter chamber containing only weathered stone slabs—ancient resting places.

Her beam caught a rectangular box suspended by a chain from the ceiling—ingenious positioning to deter pests. Inside lay an object she quickly pocketed before replacing it with their prepared item. A shudder ran through her as two rats scurried past—her greatest fear—but she maintained composure.

Emerging, Xue Jing tossed the box to Feitianlang before whispering to Guan Yu, "The show begins."

**Chapter 2578: The Fright**

Feitianlang pried open the box with trembling hands, only for a foot-long emerald serpent to strike at his face! The viper’s hue signaled lethal venom—legends spoke of such creatures requiring millennia to attain that coloration.

Yet Feitianlang’s reflexes proved worthy of his epithet. In a blur, he snapped the lid shut, crushing the serpent’s body before stomping it into the earth. Panting, he glared at the duo. "Clever trick. Nearly cost me my life."

Xue Jing pouted in disappointment as Feitianlang retrieved a rolled parchment from the debris—a square of leather resembling pigskin, marked with cryptic symbols. His laughter echoed off the cliffs. "The treasure map! Fortune smiles upon Feitianlang!"

Guan Yu interjected weakly, "You have your prize. Now the antidote—and release the temple hostages."

Tossing a vial contemptuously, Feitianlang vanished down the mountain, crowing in triumph.

**Aftermath**

Watching the bandit’s retreat, Guan Yu rose smoothly, all pretense of illness gone. "Surprising—he honored the deal. Reputations can deceive."

Xue Jing arched an eyebrow. "You planned this? To redirect the hunters’ focus?"

"Precisely," Guan Yu grinned. "Let the wolves tear at each other over that forgery. We’ve bigger plans."

Returning to the temple, they found Wei Hongwei and others still瘫坐ed weakly. Administering the antidote brought gradual recovery.

Wei Hongwei groaned, massaging his temples. "What poison was that? Any lasting effects?"

"None... unless your conscience acts up," Guan Yu teased before sobering. To the four monks, particularly the bearded stalwart who’d defied Feitianlang, he said, "Your courage impressed me. A man worth calling brother."

The monks gaped. "How’d you hear our conversation? You were unconscious!"

"Acted the part," Guan Yu winked. "Needed to gauge Feitianlang’s true intent."

Wei Hongwei marveled, "I knew you’d outsmart him! But why surrender the real map?"

"Real?" Guan Yu chuckled. "That decoy will set the Jianghu ablaze. Let them chase shadows while we work unseen."

**Chapter 2579: The Gathering Storm**

As the group recuperated, distant shouts echoed up the mountain—proof the forged map had already drawn new players. Guan Yu’s smile held no mirth. "The game intensifies. Ready yourselves."

The bearded monk clasped Guan Yu’s shoulder. "You’ve made an enemy today. Feitianlang won’t forgive this humiliation."

"Let him come," Guan Yu said, eyes hardening. "When wolves circle, sometimes you must become the hunter."

Below, the first torches of approaching factions flickered through the trees—the Jianghu’s vultures, drawn by rumor and greed. The real battle was just beginning.
