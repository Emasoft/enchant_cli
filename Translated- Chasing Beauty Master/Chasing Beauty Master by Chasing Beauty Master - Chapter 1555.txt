“Now look at yours—the reflectivity is somewhat weaker, and the transparency isn’t as pristine as the previous piece. So, Xiao Lu’s meteoric iron is of slightly higher quality than yours. Though they appear broadly similar, even a minor discrepancy in purity can lead to vastly different results when forging artifacts.”

After listening to Chief Lu’s explanation, Xuan Ming nodded in understanding and added, “Uncle Jiu, if you’re willing to refine them, I’ll bring all the remaining meteoric iron to you once I return. With your experience, the artifacts forged would surely be of a far superior grade.”

**Chapter 4032: Cherish What You Have**

“Nonsense. You should experiment yourselves. I’ve no leisure for such tasks at my age, nor do I crave artifacts anymore. The most suitable artifacts are those one refines personally. You ought to try forging your own. Experience comes with time, after all.”

Uncle Jiu’s words were clear, though his refusal was evident. Xuan Ming had hoped to have Uncle Jiu refine the meteoric iron into artifacts for them, but the elder showed no interest in the effort.

Chief Lu remained silent, retrieving his own piece of meteoric iron. He was certain Uncle Jiu wouldn’t take it, as Xuan Ming had already gifted him two pieces.

Internally, Chief Lu mused that Guan Yu had indeed treated him well. Earlier, when selecting meteoric iron in Xuan Ming’s study, he had chosen pieces resembling the two Guan Yu had given him—translucent under sunlight, with excellent reflectivity. Guan Yu must have deliberately picked the finest specimens for him.

Uncle Jiu remarked, “Meteoric iron is a rare treasure scarcely seen in the entire martial world. Rumor claims it originates not from our realm, though none know its true source. You must cherish it dearly.”

“Thank you for the guidance, Uncle Jiu,” Xuan Ming said.

The elder continued, “I too possess a small fragment of meteoric iron, no larger than an egg. With these two new pieces, I might refine them when the mood strikes. If successful, I’ll inform you.”

This implied his agreement to forge an artifact. Delighted, Xuan Ming replied, “Many thanks, Uncle Jiu. We’ve troubled you greatly.”

“Hmph, trouble is trivial. But when Guan Yu returns, ensure he visits me. I’d gladly crack open that boy’s skull to see what peculiarities lie within,” Uncle Jiu chuckled.

“Understood. I’ll relay the message. We’ll take our leave now,” Xuan Ming said.

After departing the mountain, Chief Lu wondered aloud, “What artifact might Uncle Jiu forge? I’m eager to see. Perhaps I’ll delay refining mine until after his success, to learn from his methods.”

“Prudent as ever. Gaining wisdom from others is wise indeed,” Xuan Ming laughed, envisioning the remaining meteoric iron. He planned to keep some for himself and craft spiritual energy reservoirs for disciples. Though not all could receive one, those who did would gain significant combat strength.

Meanwhile, the Demon Soul Sect remained peaceful, save for Wang Xiaorong’s restlessness. Since learning of Guan Yu’s departure from the Cloud Azure Sect, she had yearned to seek him out, yet he had vanished without a trace.

Despite deploying numerous scouts, no news surfaced. Today, her patience frayed, and she confronted the Demon Lord.

“Father, I’m leaving to find Guan Yu. Don’t stop me,” she declared, turning to leave like an ant on a hot pan.

“Halt!” The Demon Lord sighed at his daughter’s impulsiveness. “Must you be so unrestrained? Where’s your decorum?”

“Guan Yu’s whereabouts are unknown, and his silence likely means he’s avoiding you. Searching blindly is futile. Wait until we locate him.”

To placate her, he added, “I’ll intensify the search. Once we have leads, you may go. Isn’t that better than wandering aimlessly?”

“But what if we never find him?” she fretted. “I’ll die of anxiety!”

“Endure a little longer. I’ll dispatch more scouts. Guan Yu will be found swiftly—then you can depart,” the Demon Lord coaxed gently.

“Father, could Guan Yu be in danger? What if something happened?”

“Child, Guan Yu is cleverer than a monkey, armed with treasures and formidable cultivation. Few could threaten him. Even I couldn’t guarantee defeating him. Set your worries aside.”

Wang Xiaorong conceded his point but pressed, “Then why his silence? I must find him! Deploy every sect member!”

“Must you be so unreasonable?” the Demon Lord admonished. “You know this season is when my old wounds flare, leaving the sect vulnerable. Our enemies watch closely. Sending everyone out would endanger us all. Patience!”

Mention of his ailments softened her resolve. This annual period required the Demon Lord’s secluded recovery, but recent events—the stolen *Universal Compass* from the Crimson Lotus Sect and their vengeful pursuit—delayed his retreat. His true fear was Wang Xiaorong’s rash departure amidst the brewing storm.

“But Guan Yu promised me a gift! Don’t you wish to see the crossbow he crafted?” she countered.

“I do, but timing is unfavorable. Perhaps Guan Yu is on a covert mission for the Cloud Azure Sect, necessitating secrecy. If so, your interference would jeopardize him. Your differing statuses complicate matters further.”

Reluctantly, Wang Xiaorong acquiesced. “If he truly cares, he’ll reappear. Trust his intentions,” the Demon Lord reassured before summoning his Left Envoy.

“Report on the Crimson Lotus Sect’s movements. My health demands seclusion.”

“They remain subdued, Master. Our theft of the compass humiliated them, but they dare not act openly. Conceal your retreat, and they’ll stay hesitant.”

“Yet my greater concern is Xiaorong’s safety. If she flees, the Crimson Lotus may target her. Strengthen efforts to locate Guan Yu—only near him will she be secure.”

The Left Envoy nodded. “Strange—Guan Yu has vanished completely. Our spies report no unusual Cloud Azure activity.”

“Another matter: an anonymous patron offers riches for Prince Zou’s assassination.”

The Demon Lord smirked. “The emperor’s ailing health sparks succession wars. Prince Zou, once a Cloud Azure disciple who saved the emperor’s life, now faces scrutiny as a potential heir. The princes conspire against him.”

“A pawn in the emperor’s game,” the Left Envoy deduced.

“Precisely. The emperor uses him to expose his sons’ ambitions. Whether Prince Zou lives or dies matters not—it’s all a ploy.”

“Shall we accept the contract?”

“Why refuse? We’re already deemed heretics. Take the payment. Success… is another matter.”

**Chapter 4034: A Perilous Position**

The Demon Lord’s laughter echoed, cold and calculating. “Let the mortal realm burn. We’ll dance in its ashes.”
