Just as the Venomous Widow tilted her teapot toward the man, the water seemingly about to spill, she inwardly congratulated herself on her cleverness.

But at that precise moment, the man flicked his toes upward and stepped outward. With a metallic clang, the steel teapot crashed to the floor as the man materialized two meters away.

Though Bill Lin and the young attendant assumed the Venomous Widow had simply fumbled, she knew better. This was an expert far beyond her capabilities—someone she couldn't hope to oppose.

The speed was inhuman. Before she could react to the spilling water, he had already vanished. Such preternatural swiftness defied belief.

"Oh dear! Are you alright? My deepest apologies," she exclaimed, her voice honeyed with false concern now that she recognized his superiority.

The man stood like an iron pillar, his voice glacial: "Cease these petty tricks." The words carried an edge that prickled the skin.

This was none other than Second Only to Wolf. Having taken lodgings nearby to monitor the pawnshop, he'd noticed three suspicious vehicles arrive. Recognizing Bill Lin's party, he'd donned a hat and cloak to infiltrate their group.

Entering the shop first to disrupt their plans, he'd anticipated the Venomous Widow's probing when she sat beside him. As she poured tea, he was ready.

His display served as warning—a demonstration of power to deter foolish actions. The gambit succeeded; the Venomous Widow now understood his might.

The attendant rushed forward. "Is everyone unharmed?" He retrieved the fallen teapot.

"My carelessness," the Venomous Widow simpered.

"Not at all. Let me brew a fresh pot." The youth briskly mopped the spill.

Resuming his seat with calculated nonchalance, Second Only to Wolf noted his neighbors' sudden phone fixation. Had his display truly cowed them so? Unlikely—the Venomous Widow was a First-Class Adept herself. This silence felt... strategic.

Indeed, hidden messages flew between conspirators:

[Venomous Widow]: "An elite beyond my skill sits beside us."

[Bill Lin]: "Summon Luo Bo? Between you two..."

[Venomous Widow]: "Uncertain. But reinforcements wise."

Meanwhile, Second Only to Wolf's mind raced. Luo Bo's arrival would expose his identity through aura recognition. He must depart before then—yet abandoning surveillance conflicted with his mission to disrupt Bill Lin's treasure map acquisition.

Originally planning to bid against Bill Lin and drive up the price, this new complication forced recalculation. A discreet call to Guan Yu brought new orders: withdraw, send replacement.

As Second Only to Wolf exited, he instructed the attendant: "Inform Master Wu I bring wealth-bearing news. He must contact me first." Pressing a card into the youth's hand, he vanished.

Bill Lin fretted: "Where'd he go? Fetching allies?"

"Useless," the Venomous Widow dismissed. "Against such skill, numbers mean nothing."

When Luo Bo arrived, his wandering hand found the Venomous Widow's thigh even as he questioned the vanished threat. Though suspecting Second Only to Wolf's involvement, pride kept him silent about past defeats.

The pawnshop door chimed again. A nondescript middle-aged man entered—Guan Yu's plant, Zhang De of the Yang Family. His blunt declaration froze the room: "The Yang Family seeks the treasure map. Name your price."

Master Wu's entrance then sparked fresh competition. Bill Lin rushed to intercept: "I've awaited you all morning, Master Wu. The Bill Family—allied with the Feng Clan—desires..."

But Zhang De cut through: "The Yangs will pay whatever's required."

As tea steamed and tensions simmered, Master Wu's eyes gleamed gold at the prospect of a bidding war. The real game had just begun.
