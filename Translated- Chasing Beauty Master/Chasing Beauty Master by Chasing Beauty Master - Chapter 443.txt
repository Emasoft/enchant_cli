Wan Qingyang (Pure Aspiration) nodded and said, “Though the spiritual energy of heaven and earth isn’t as abundant as before, those favored by providence may still achieve the Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown spontaneously and ascend realms. Brother Guan must be one such chosen soul.”

His tone brimmed with envy. In these diminished times, cultivators toiled through countless hardships for minor breakthroughs. Yet Guan Yu had reached the Heart Motion Realm through sheer serendipity—a fortune no one could regard calmly.

Guan Yu considered himself fortunate but dared not assume uniqueness in the vast cultivation world. “How many sects remain nowadays?”

“To my knowledge, one hundred and eight sects of varying sizes still endure!”

“So many!” Guan Yu had imagined mere dozens at most.

Wan Qingyang inclined his head. “This excludes reclusive sects unknown to me. Some dwell beyond our borders like myself, while others live among mortals, indistinguishable from ordinary folk.”

The modern era left no hiding places for cultivation sects within China’s borders. Some like Wan sought remote wilderness, while others blended into cities with utmost discretion. Places like Mount Longhu, Mount Jiuhua, and White Cloud Temple—though tourist attractions—maintained hidden legacies through illusion arrays. What visitors saw were mere facades, not true inheritors.

True transcendents existed too, like the Abbot of White Cloud Temple who balanced cultivation with leadership of China’s Taoist Association. Currently, the cultivation world’s hierarchy stood thus: Kunlun Sect of Mount Kunlun as foremost, followed by Qingcheng of Mount Emei, Mount Jiuhua’s Buddhist sect in third, White Cloud Temple fourth, with major sects like Mount Longhu and Mount Mao rounding the list. Compared to these, Pure Aspiration Sect remained a minor faction.

“Dwelling in mundane society can stabilize the dao heart. My sect once considered urban settlement but remained tethered to desert isolation through generations of seclusion.”

Chapter 1107: The Dragon Group Arrives

Wan paused before continuing, “If possible, I’d ask Brother Guan’s assistance.”

“Speak.”

“Help us secure a dwelling in the mortal realm for Pure Aspiration Sect.” This plan formed when Wan recognized their desert abode’s dwindling spiritual energy. “F***ing 1'51 Reading Network. I have only one thing to say: our update speed is n times faster than other sites, with fewer ads. Our grotto-heaven’s energy nears depletion.”

“Easily done! I’ll find you an energy-rich sanctuary!”

Though minor, Pure Aspiration Sect’s ancient lineage offered invaluable guidance to Guan Yu—a complete novice needing protection. He resolved to settle them in N City.

“After current affairs conclude, I’ll show you potential sites. Any chosen land shall be yours.”

“My profound gratitude, Brother Guan.”

As they reached the desert’s edge, Wan stored his magical artifact, awaiting Zhou Xiaochuan’s vehicle.

After military transport and aircraft arrangements, they arrived at Zhou Manor within hours.

“Grandpa Zhou, this is Sect Leader Wan,” Guan Yu presented.

“Master Zhou, I deeply regret my disciple’s transgressions. May I examine the traitor to understand his deeds against your granddaughter?”

Zhou waved guards to escort Wan to Ah Fa. Post-departure, Zhou told Guan Yu, “Follow me. Someone wishes to meet you.”

In the parlor sat two ill-matched suits—one tall and lean, the other short and stout. Their sharp gazes and restrained auras betrayed extraordinary natures.

The lean man introduced, “Code One and Code Two, Dragon Group operatives. We require your assistance.”

Dragon Group—China’s shadowy department housing elite soldiers, psychics, geniuses, and superhumans like Guan Yu himself. Anticipating their approach, Guan Yu remained calm. “Why should I comply?”

“Our word equals the higher-ups’ command. You’ve no choice,” the fat man sneered.

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “Dragon Group? Why should I heed you?”

“Guan Yu!” The fat man smashed a premium mahogany table to splinters. “Your parlor tricks pale against Dragon Group’s might!”

“Then why seek my help? Handle it yourselves!”

As tensions escalated, Zhou feared for his courtyard. The lean man intervened, “We request aid, but refusal is possible. However, remember—your loved ones lack protection. Should cultivation sects intervene, we’ll neutralize them.”

Naked threats.

Zhou shook his head—these fools didn’t know Guan Yu thrived on defiance.

“Threatening me?” Guan Yu’s laughter turned dangerous. “Let’s test Dragon Group’s mettle!”

In a blur, he hoisted both men mid-air by their throats. “Dare lay hands on Dragon Group?!” they choked.

“I’ll cripple you both!”

As their faces purpled, Zhou cautioned, “However worthless, their deaths bring complications. Hear their request first.”

Guan Yu flung them outside. “Want my help? Send your leader to negotiate!”

“You’ll regret this!” they vowed before fleeing.

“Trouble brews,” Zhou sighed.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Minnows. Dragon Group needs me more. Why devalue myself through compliance?”

Chapter 1108: Southern Brightness Departing Fire

Unperturbed, Guan Yu strategized—Dragon Group’s desperate request likely involved mortal peril. He’d exact proper payment.

Wan Qingyang emerged then.

“My granddaughter’s condition?” Zhou pressed.

Wan grimaced. “The traitor used Blood Yellow Lotus in her medicine.”

“What’s that?”

“A crimson desert plant resembling yellow lotus but lethally toxic. Mixed into Qi Condensing Pills, it grants 80% success but destroys the cauldron—the patient.”

Meaning Zhou Xiaoyou would die upon pill completion.

Zhou’s face darkened. “Solutions?”

“One... unconventional method.” Wan hesitated. “Is the lady married?”

“No. Relevance?”

“The pill’s extreme yin requires yang compensation. Only a Heart Motion Realm cultivator’s Southern Brightness Departing Fire can neutralize its cold.”

Among cultivation’s Two Great Fires, Southern Brightness Departing Fire kindles in Heart Motion experts, while Three Flavors True Fire emerges at Unity Realm. Guan Yu alone qualified.

“What must I do?” Guan Yu offered readily.

“In fifteen days during pill formation, channel your fire to purge her cold.”

Zhou paled at “burning,” but Guan Yu clarified, “Southern Fire burns souls, not flesh. With control, harmless.”

“Practice absolute fire control these weeks,” Wan urged.

Under Wan’s tutelage, Guan Yu mastered fire manipulation within days, though incantations still annoyed him. “All cultivators begin thus,” Wan assured. “Mastery brings silent casting.”

Progress impressed Wan—typical experts required months. But time betrayed them when Zhou Xiaoyou vanished.

Chapter 1109: Zhou Xiaoyou’s Disappearance

Masked intruders breached Zhou Manor’s defenses undetected—even by Wan—snatching the comatose girl. Only cultivation experts could achieve this.

Zhou’s wrath summoned Dragon Group’s Code Eagle (superhuman agility) and Code Tiger (sonic destruction). Unlike previous envoys, these observed Guan Yu with curiosity rather than contempt.

As five strategized in Zhou’s parlor, storm clouds gathered.
