“Lin Qiaoqiao nodded immediately. She hadn’t expected Guan Yu to be so quick-witted, yet this turned out to be an excellent conversational pivot. ‘That’s right, Aunt,’ she said. ‘You don’t know—there’s been so much trouble in town these past few days. Just this noon, many people were burned at the stake!’”

“Guan Yu knew the aunt wasn’t a local resident but had come from elsewhere.”

“‘I came precisely because I heard about today’s executions,’ the aunt replied. ‘Having never witnessed such a thing, I wanted to see for myself. But this silly girl delayed us by fooling around on the way. By the time we arrived, the burning had already ended.’”

“‘Mama,’ Xiao Zhu retorted, ‘burning people alive must be horrifying! Why would you travel all this way just to watch? We should’ve played longer on the road instead!’”

“‘Exactly, Aunt,’ Lin Zhonggeng interjected as he returned. ‘I was terrified too. Guan Yu and I left before the executions even began.’”

“Lin Qiaoqiao’s mother stood and said a few words before declaring, ‘Continue your chat. I’ll go instruct the servants to prepare dinner.’”

“The aunt observed, ‘Brother-in-law, you look utterly exhausted. What kept you so busy?’”

“‘Ah, you wouldn’t know,’ Lin Zhonggeng sighed, sinking into a chair. ‘Today we executed the male members of the Li family. I’ve been assisting until now—haven’t even had a sip of water.’”

“When a servant brought tea, Lin Zhonggeng snapped impatiently, ‘Fetch me cool boiled water first! How can I drink this scalding brew?’”

“‘At once, Master,’ the servant scurried out. Guan Yu noted the customs here resembled the late Qingcao era—women held no status before men, treated as mere maidservants. The household staff worshipped the master like a deity, obeying every command under threat of reprimand.”

“‘Brother-in-law,’ the aunt pressed, ‘shouldn’t such major affairs be handled by the town magistrate? Why were you involved?’”

“‘You’re unaware,’ Lin Zhonggeng explained. ‘Among those executed was the magistrate’s own wife, Li Hong. She murdered Granny Wang. After her crime was exposed, the council decided the magistrate couldn’t remain in power. Thus the responsibilities fell to me.’”

“‘What?’ The aunt gasped. ‘The magistrate’s wife killed Granny Wang? But everyone revered that elderly widow—her reputation extended even to our village! Why would anyone murder a defenseless old woman?’”

“Only now did Guan Yu realize Granny Wang’s fame reached beyond their town—this was no ordinary matter.”

“‘Li Hong killed Granny Wang to create chaos,’ Lin Zhonggeng clarified. ‘She hoped to divert attention while helping the Li men escape. But none succeeded—all perished in the flames.’”

“The aunt shook her head mournfully. ‘An innocent good soul caught in the crossfire. Such tragedies occur everywhere.’”

“Growing bored with adult talk, Xiao Zhu tugged at Guan Yu’s sleeve. ‘Brother-in-law! Let’s go play outside! I heard you’re super skilled—show me some martial arts!’”

“Guan Yu’s head throbbed at the request but he couldn’t refuse. Lin Qiaoqiao intervened, ‘There’s nothing for us here. Let’s go out.’”

“Relieved to escape the stifling atmosphere, Guan Yu led Xiao Zhu to a willow tree. ‘How about I teach you throwing knives?’ he offered.”

“‘Yes! Yes!’ Xiao Zhu clapped excitedly as Guan Yu had servants fetch two small blades.”

“‘No proper throwing daggers available,’ Guan Yu said. ‘We’ll use these. Watch closely.’ He demonstrated from several meters away, the blade thunking into the trunk.”

“After Xiao Zhu’s failed attempts, she complained, ‘Why can’t I hit it? Are you hiding secrets?’”

“‘No tricks,’ Guan Yu lied. ‘Practice a hundred throws daily. I trained long myself.’”

“Chapter 3070: Knife Tricks”

“Enchanted by her handsome teacher, Xiao Zhu believed every word. She began hurling knives enthusiastically while Guan Yu watched contentedly.”

“‘Brother-in-law,’ she whined between throws, ‘why can’t I aim right?’”

“Guan Yu suggested moving closer. When her blade finally grazed the tree, Xiao Zhu demanded more knives. Lin Qiaoqiao went to inquire about supplies while Guan Yu tried sneaking away.”

“Xiao Zhu grabbed his arm. ‘Stay and teach me! Don’t leave!’”

“‘Your brother-in-law’s an idiot,’ Lin Qiaoqiao teased. ‘You’ll learn nothing.’”

“‘I don’t care!’ Xiao Zhu clung tighter. ‘He stays!’”

“Trapped between them, Guan Yu lamented his predicament—what began as pretending to be Lin Qiaoqiao’s boyfriend had spiraled into babysitting her clingy cousin.”

“When Lin Qiaoqiao returned to find them pressed together, she shouted, ‘Guan Yu! What are you doing?!’”

“‘Teaching knife techniques!’ they chorused. Xiao Zhu added, ‘You ruined my throw, Sister!’”

“Chapter 3071: Ignore Him”

“As Guan Yu resumed guiding Xiao Zhu’s hand, Lin Qiaoqiao fumed at their proximity. ‘Aunt and Father need Guan Yu!’ she insisted.”

“‘No!’ Xiao Zhu protested, tugging Guan Yu’s other arm. ‘I’m keeping him!’”

“Caught in the tug-of-war, Guan Yu wished for escape—until remembering Xiao Zhu’s warm presence. The fifteen-year-old’s deliberate squirming and floral scent tested his resolve.”

“When Xiao Zhu cooed about enjoying his embrace, Guan Yu warned, ‘Focus or I leave!’”

“‘Mean brother-in-law!’ she pouted, grinding against him until Lin Zhonggeng’s arrival interrupted.”

“‘Qiao’er!’ the father called. ‘Why the delay? I heard arguing!’”

“‘Xiao Zhu won’t release Guan Yu!’ Lin Qiaoqiao complained.”

“Xiao Zhu countered, ‘Sister’s jealous! Can’t she share you awhile?’”

“Guan Yu sweat at her phrasing. The matured girl proved immune to past tricks—her calculated flirtations and quick lies revealing unexpected cunning.”

“As Lin Zhonggeng approached, Guan Yu stood trapped between obligations and temptation, the willow’s shadow stretching long over their tangled drama.”
