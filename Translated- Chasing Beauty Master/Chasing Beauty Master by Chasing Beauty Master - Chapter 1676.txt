“That time, we suffered many casualties, but sacrifices were necessary to help Prince Zou escape. The third captain personally drove the carriage charging straight into the enemy ranks to disrupt their formation, buying His Highness time to flee. In the end, Prince Zou survived, but the captain... he never returned.”

“What did you say?” Boss Zhou slammed the table as he roared to his feet. Zou Xiaoyu stood frozen, wide-eyed, scarcely daring to believe her ears.

Guanyu had anticipated this reaction. While inevitable grief was understandable, he hoped the young woman could maintain composure—excessive sorrow might harm her health.

“Are you spinning lies? You claim my sworn brother is dead?” Boss Zhou jabbed an accusing finger, his illiterate temper flaring as always. The burly man looked ready to throw punches.

Guanyu remained seated, speaking calmly. “I wished to spare you this news, yet truth cannot remain hidden. You deserved to know.” His gaze softened. “Every word is true. I accompanied Prince Zou through storms of blood. When we reached the capital, only Zou WuHui remained at his side—all others perished.”

The chair creaked as Boss Zhou collapsed into it, disbelief warring with reluctant acceptance. The account held terrible plausibility.

Rising, Guanyu approached Zou Xiaoyu. “Miss Zou, please accept my condolences.”

The girl nodded mechanically, tears overflowing despite her trembling efforts to contain them. “I knew... When no letters came after father reached the capital... I’d prepared myself...” Her voice shattered. Covering her mouth, she fled the room.

“Should someone check on her?” Guanyu asked urgently.

Boss Zhou stood with heavy dignity. “Let the child grieve. Wait here, Master Guan.”

When they returned later, the tavern keeper’s calloused hand rested on the red-eyed girl’s shoulder. “You still have me, little minnow. Your father’s love remains. His sacrifice for Prince Zou won’t be in vain.”

Apologies were exchanged, tension easing into weary acceptance. Boss Zhou studied Guanyu anew. “You opposed the Second Prince himself? Aren’t you afraid?”

“Fear the victor yet uncrowned,” Guanyu shrugged. “His current power means nothing.”

Suspicion lingered. “Forgive my bluntness—how does a pampered youth survive unscathed where seasoned warriors fell?”

Before Guanyu could respond, Xiaoyu interjected: “Uncle, didn’t you notice? Earlier, I hid outside—you detected nothing, yet Master Guan knew immediately. That proves his capability.”

Modesty proved unnecessary. A sudden fist came streaking toward Guanyu’s face—Boss Zhou’s idea of testing. With effortless motion, Guanyu caught the punch, flipping his assailant to the floorboards.

“Apologies!” Guanyu helped the groaning man up. “Reflex.”

Rubbing his back, Boss Zhou chuckled ruefully. “Well struck! Never seen such speed!”

Xiaoyu’s grief-lightened scold completed the reconciliation. When Guanyu moved to leave, the girl reminded: “Your friend’s debt?”

“Ah yes.” Guanyu produced a golden leaf worth thrice the owed silver. “For Lin Chen’s freedom.”

Xiaoyu frowned. “Why associate with such riffraff?”

“Merely a sect junior.” Guanyu’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “We’re from Yunqing Sect—please keep this confidential.”

Refusing repayment, Boss Zhou clasped Guanyu’s shoulder. “Between Prince Zou’s men, let’s be brothers!”

Xiaoyu protested the generational mismatch until Guanyu proposed: “Titles matter not. Miss Zou may call me ‘elder brother’ while I address Zhou as ‘brother’—separate but equal.”

Laughter sealed the pact. Though declining to stay, Guanyu accepted future friendship. At the inn, Lin Chen’s smarmy gratitude earned only disdain. Addressing assembled disciples, Guanyu announced: “Our funds are exhausted. We await sect reinforcements.”

As murmurs spread, Guanyu watched Xiaoyu discreetly. Her lingering tears couldn’t erase the new understanding in her gaze—nor his unease at debts left unpaid.
