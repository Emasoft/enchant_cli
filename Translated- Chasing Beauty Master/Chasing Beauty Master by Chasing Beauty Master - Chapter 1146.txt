“No, the boss said we must get this done by tonight. Looks like something’s happening at the leather factory. We just need to handle our part and not worry about the rest. This is a fat job! We’ll get extra cash, and I’ll buy you whatever you want,” Wei Hongwei said excitedly.

“So it’s a lucrative job? No wonder you’re so eager. Hehehe,” Qian Yaoyao chuckled.

“You drive home first. Since you didn’t drink, I’ll take a taxi to find the installation crew,” Wei Hongwei said as they reached the restaurant entrance.

Qian Yaoyao suggested, “Why bother with a taxi? I’ve got nothing to do at home. Let me drive you—it’ll save time and hassle.”

Last time, Wei Hongwei had been stopped by police for drunk driving right after leaving a hotel. He’d been severely intoxicated, hauled to the station, and nearly had his license and car confiscated. After his father pulled strings until 3 a.m., they’d settled the matter with a 5,000-yuan fine. Since then, Wei had learned his lesson—now he simply took taxis when drinking.

Taking her advice, Wei agreed, “Fine, drive me then. I need to call my dad first,” he said, pulling out his phone.

Meanwhile, Wang Hu waited in the office. Guan Yu had instructed him to await Wei’s call. Within an hour, Wei and his father had gathered nearly thirty camera installation workers. Qian Yaoyao drove Wei to the leather factory gates, waiting for the full crew before entering.

When Wang Hu arrived, he asked Wei, “Is the boss here?”
“No, he left after notifying you. When will your people arrive?”
“Almost all here—just two or three missing.”

Wang Hu handed over a floor plan. “Does your team have a leader? They can use this to install cameras in marked locations. After finishing, report to me for inspection.”

Wei took the blueprint. “Make copies—each crew works independently and gets paid separately. Give everyone their own map to follow.”

Wang Hu agreed, realizing this would save him from guiding each team. The factory’s sudden camera installation soon reached Bi Erlin’s ears.

In the Feng family’s parlor, Sun Xu (wheelchair-bound), Bi Erlin, Young Master Feng, and Du Guafu (Poison Widow) convened. Sun Xu warned, “Guan Yu’s making moves—dozens of cameras being installed.”

Du Guafu shrugged. “We’ve paused our operations. More cameras won’t matter if Sun’s man controls the monitoring room. Guan Yu’s recordings will show nothing useful.”

Young Master Feng, trimming his nails, countered, “Don’t be so sure. Guan Yu might replace your mole with his own people, exposing everything.”

Bi Erlin snapped, “Why always take his side? Want him to ruin our plans?”
“Just considering possibilities. If my thoughts offend, I’ll leave,” Feng retorted, slamming his bedroom door upstairs.

Sun Xu worried, “Guan Yu likely suspects us. He may purge my old staff once his trainees master the techniques.”

Bi Erlin coldly remarked, “So your people are temporary? A timed liability?”
Sun Xu backpedaled, “Their expertise can’t be replicated quickly. It’ll take years for replacements.”

Du Guafu interjected, “I heard Ge Yinglai’s returning—his legs healed. Sun Xu, remember Bi promised you overseas treatment after this succeeds.”

Bi Erlin grinned. “Once our big order traps Guan Yu, his billion-yuan compensation will fund your recovery. We’ll recoup all losses!”

**Chapter 2933: The Good Life**

Discussing Ma Tong’s involvement, Du Guafu explained, “He’ll disguise his men as my operatives to attack Guan Yu’s businesses. Deniability intact.”

Bi Erlin scoffed, “Still fearing Guan Yu. But manpower’s scarce—we’ll take it. Have Ma Tong strike soon to distract Guan Yu from factory matters.”

Later at Ma Tong’s casino, Du Guafu found him absent. The manager claimed he was “away on business.” Calling Ma, she fumed inwardly—the coward was hiding from Guan Yu’s wrath.

Ma assured, “The plan proceeds tonight. My men will hit his bars and spas—minimal security there now.”

**Chapter 2934: Trouble Brews**

At the newly reopened bar, manager Jia Bo reveled in his perks—flirting with staff in a VIP room. “These uniforms should be easier to remove,” he leered, hands wandering as a blushing server feigned resistance.

Outside, twenty thugs stormed in, bats swinging. Patrons froze as the leader barked, “Smash everything!”

With most male staff replaced by Jia’s female picks, the six remaining men stood no chance. Chaos erupted—glass shattered, screams echoed—while upstairs, Jia remained oblivious, his “good life” about to crumble.
