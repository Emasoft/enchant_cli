Guan Yu was stunned, rendered speechless by Siqi’s question. She was right—why had he acted this way? Where did his confidence come from? Their relationship was still uncertain, not even a flicker of commitment.

Though she had previously hinted at her feelings, they were not yet lovers. Siqi had every right to develop feelings for any other man.

Seeing Guan Yu’s bewildered expression, Siqi knew she had asked a question he couldn’t answer. Indeed, he had no idea how to respond.

“I’ll endure it,” Siqi said coolly. “You found the people, you devised the plan, and since I agreed, I’ll bear it.”

Guan Yu sighed. “I have no confidence. And you… you have the right to like others. That’s beyond my control. I’m not forcing you to endure this. If you’re unwilling, I’ll remove them from the team immediately. Don’t push yourself.”

Hearing this, Siqi’s face darkened further. Her voice trembled. “Guan Yu, can’t you even fight for me? Are you so heartless, using me to entice them? Does this not pain you?”

“That’s not my intention at all. Don’t misunderstand,” Guan Yu explained.

“Isn’t it? We’ve reached this point, yet you deny it. Are you even a responsible man?” Though she held back tears, they spilled from her eyes.

Guan Yu’s heart shattered. Siqi, whom he had always seen as cold and resilient, now seemed fragile. He had wounded her deeply.

“You wanted to bring them here,” Siqi continued. “You wanted revenge. You asked me to play this role, knowing they’d cling to me, knowing how much I despise them. Did you ever consider my feelings?”

Guan Yu fell silent. There was no way to justify his actions. He had traded Siqi’s pain for revenge against Ling Su and the others. Now, it felt utterly worthless.

There were countless ways to deal with them—ways that didn’t require Siqi’s suffering. He had been thoughtless.

“I was wrong,” Guan Yu said apologetically. “When we return, I’ll declare you as my woman. I’ll warn them to stay away—if you wish.”

Siqi wiped her tears. “No. We’ve come this far. I’ll endure it. I’ll help you, even with other tasks. Just… don’t betray my heart.”

Guan Yu flinched, her final words echoing like a blade: *“Don’t betray my heart.”*

Regret surged—a feeling he hadn’t known in years. He had hurt someone who cared for him.

“I understand your heart,” Guan Yu said firmly. “I never intended to use you. This outcome was unforeseen. But know this: your affection is met with my love. You’ll always have a place in my heart.”

He stepped forward, gently wiping her tears. “I was wrong to make you suffer. It ends now.” Pulling her into an embrace, he ignored the distant onlookers.

Though resentful, Siqi melted into his arms, exhaustion weighing on her. She would follow Guan Yu anywhere—even to kill—but this role tormented her. Her nature couldn’t tolerate flattery, especially with Guan Yu watching indifferently.

“I’m sorry,” Guan Yu murmured. “This ends today. They’ll never approach you again. I’ll never ignore your pain.”

“Guan Yu, don’t. I’m not blaming you,” Siqi whispered.

Her anger had softened. Guan Yu’s explanation soothed her—he hadn’t truly exploited her. Knowing his heart, she let go of her resentment.

“I can endure this,” she said. “Let’s continue. Avoid conflict with Ling Su and Lin Chen for now.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “It’s too late. They’ve already seen us. Even unspoken, they know.”

“Right.” Siqi pushed him away. “Why are you still holding me? They’ll see!” Peering past him, she spotted the crowd’s stares and flushed.

Guan Yu smiled. “Let them watch. With or without Lin Chen and Ling Su, we’ll secure the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.”

“But if they learn of our relationship, they’ll plot against you,” Siqi worried.

“Do I look afraid?” Guan Yu shrugged. “I made Lin Chen vice-captain and put him in charge of Xuanming’s gold. Ling Su will seethe. Let them turn on each other.”

“Lin Chen gambles recklessly. He’ll squander the funds, leaving him desperate.”

“But if he loses all our gold, how will we travel?” Siqi gasped.

Guan Yu chuckled, producing a thick stack of banknotes from his sleeve. “No worries. I have endless wealth.”

Siqi gaped. “How? Most Yunqing Sect disciples are poor. Do you run a business?”

“Too tedious. My gold flows without theft or toil.”

Siqi’s mind drifted to their earlier embrace—surely witnessed. “Let’s continue the act. Keep Ling Su and Lin Chen focused on me, not you.”

“If you insist,” Guan Yu agreed. “Play angry when we return. And… why didn’t you wear the dress I gave you?”

“I treasure it too much! Besides, horseback riding ruins skirts.”

“I’ll buy you ten more. Wear them freely.”

“No. The first is special. I’ll preserve it forever.”

Guan Yu mused on their differing natures. Wang Xiaorong would’ve reveled in this scheme, charming and manipulating Ling Su and Lin Chen into ruin. But Siqi’s honesty made her recoil from pretense.

Had Wang Xiaorong received the dress, she’d flaunt it daily. Siqi cherished it privately.

Regretfully, Guan Yu acknowledged his oversight. Siqi’s steadfastness clashed with the task. Alternative plans were needed—perhaps sowing discord between Ling Su and Lin Chen.

“If you love it, I’ll gift you more often,” Guan Yu offered.

Siqi’s frustration stemmed from his aloofness and the men’s pestering. She treasured the dress, fearing damage during travel.

“Let’s return silently,” she suggested. “Answer vaguely if questioned. The act can continue.”

Guan Yu relented. “But stop if it hurts. Revenge has other paths.”

Siqi nodded. “This method is swiftest. I’ll manage.”

Reassured, Guan Yu prepared their return. No explanations were owed.

Back at camp, Ling Su rushed to Siqi. “Did he harm you?”

“No. Just weary from travel,” she replied.

Lin Chen cornered Guan Yu. “Did you embrace her?”

“You’re mistaken,” Guan Yu feigned innocence. “We spoke privately. She regrets joining this mission, wants to return.”

“Why?” Lin Chen pressed.

Guan Yu sighed. “Ling Su’s constant attention repulses her. She’ll leave unless it stops. As vice-captain, perhaps you can reason with him?”

Lin Chen hesitated—he too craved her company.

“Convince Ling Su to relent,” Guan Yu urged. “Once we reach the desert, retreat won’t be easy. Lose her now, and our group loses its only beauty.”
