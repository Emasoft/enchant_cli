Before Guan Yu could react, his body crashed heavily onto the ground. Though the fall wasn't from great height, his accumulated injuries from battling through the night proved too much. The moment he hit earth, darkness swallowed his consciousness.

When he awoke, dawn's pale light filtered through swirling mists carrying the metallic stench of decay. Every muscle screamed as he surveyed his surroundings through the haze. A primal warning prickled his spine—this fog could hide predators ready to pounce.

"Must find shelter," he rasped through cracked lips. "Regain strength... return to Forest of Elves..."

As he staggered forward, an unnatural heaviness permeated his bones. His limbs moved like lead weights. New realization struck—if attacked now, neither fight nor flight remained possible.

Clenching his jaw against the pain, Guan Yu inched toward a clearing in the mist. The fog parted to reveal a deep gorge littered with hundreds of animal skeletons. Some bones gleamed ancient white while others still bore rotting flesh—a charnel ground spanning decades.

"Did single beast devour all these?" His voice echoed hollowly. The scale suggested a predator far beyond ordinary magical creatures. Relief flickered as he noted no human remains. "Am I to be first?"

His racing heartbeat thundered in wounded ribs. This desolate canyon might become his unmarked grave, corpses weathering centuries undiscovered.

KABOOM!

Earth trembled as thunderous footsteps approached. Guan Yu froze—no shelter, no escape. Through swirling mists emerged a silhouette that froze his blood. Not magical beast, but...

"Bloody hell! That's a dragon!"

The Tyrannosaurus Rex counterpart loomed with massive jaws gripping half-eaten prey. Its amber eyes locked on Guan Yu with primal curiosity. Hot breath reeking of carrion washed over him as the snout sniffed closer.

Instinctive recoil sent the beast skittering back. Guan Yu's mind raced—its wariness wouldn't last. The half-consumed carcass bought perhaps hours before turning attention to fresher meat.

Crunching bones echoed as the predator devoured its meal in three monstrous gulps. Guan Yu's hopes sank—his battered form would barely make one mouthful.

Then... the beast yawned. Sunlight glinted off armored hide as it curled up mere meters away, rumbling snores vibrating the ground.

"Stuffed and napping? Perfect!" Guan Yu muttered. But his limbs refused response. Strange crackling emanated from within—bones shifting, flesh remolding. Memories surfaced of the Crystal Toad's essence he'd consumed. Metamorphosis?

As the dinosaur stirred hours later, Guan Yu felt renewed strength coursing through transformed sinews. When jaws snapped toward him, he leaped—not his feeble earlier hop, but a soaring arc landing astride the beast's spiked back.

"Now we dance!"

The enraged creature bucked, but Guan Yu clung like burr. Testing newfound resilience, he intentionally caught the next bite. Steel-like teeth shattered against his hardened flesh.

"Your time's done, big guy." With pitying finality, Guan Yu released a energy blast through its skull. Blue magical core glowed as he swallowed it whole, vitality flooding his veins.

Surveying the canyon exit, he adjusted ragged clothes. "To the Forest of Elves—and reckoning."

Hours later, guards gaped at his approach. Ignoring stares, Guan Yu marched toward Elder Allen's chambers. Voices raised in argument halted him at the window crack.

"...what have you truly done for our kind, Allen?" sneered Elder Kyle, exchanging glances with the traitor Locke—the very elf who'd pushed him off the cliff. Guan Yu's fists clenched. The viper's nest remained, but now... so did his fangs.
