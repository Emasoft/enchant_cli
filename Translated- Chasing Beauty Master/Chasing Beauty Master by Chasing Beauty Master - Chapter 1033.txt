Upon entering the hall, Guan Yu noticed the sofa cushions had indeed been replaced with new ones, along with the coffee table mats. The faint fragrance permeating the space restored the room to its original pristine state.

Xue Jing descended the stairs and informed him, "Guan Yu, Lü Mei claims the first-floor bathroom is too filthy for her use. She insists on having Uncle Wang renovate it entirely."

Guan Yu sighed, "Is that necessary? Couldn't we simply replace the seat cushions, floor mats, and towels? Besides, she has a private bathroom in her suite and rarely uses this common one."

Xue Jing shrugged helplessly. "You know how she is – the classic spoiled princess temperament. If she insists on using the downstairs bathroom for its spaciousness during her grooming rituals, what can we say?"

"Very well," Guan Yu conceded. "Proceed as she demands, but ensure meticulous execution with premium materials." His fingers drummed the polished banister. "Every fixture must meet her exacting standards."

"Understood. We'll have her personally select all items," Xue Jing assured before turning to address Yingzi, who approached with visible apprehension.

The Japanese woman bowed slightly. "My deepest apologies for the commotion my brother caused earlier. Please accept my humble regrets on his behalf."

Xue Jing clasped Yingzi's hands warmly. "Nonsense! We're family here. While Jinchi did create quite the mess, we understand it was mere mischief. A thorough cleaning would suffice, but you know Lü Mei's germaphobia..."

Guan Yu chuckled, joining them. "Indeed, Yingzi. Your brother merely played a prank on me. Even if this entire villa required reconstruction, I'd bear no grudge. His life-saving deed outweighs any temporary inconvenience."

Yingzi's tension eased into a grateful smile. "Your magnanimity honors us. Though I'm certain Jinchi never intended such extensive renovations. Had he foreseen..."

"Please," Guan Yu interjected firmly. "Your brother could demand this estate as payment for saving me, and I'd comply without hesitation. Let this matter trouble you no further." His gaze held hers intently, recognizing the importance of maintaining harmony among housemates. Lingering resentment, like water dripping through stone, could eventually fracture their foundation.

**Chapter 2641: Depleting Forces**

Yingzi's laughter tinkled like wind chimes. "You needn't reassure me so earnestly! This apology was merely formality. Honestly, I care little for others' opinions of me."

Guan Yu studied her eyes, seeking truth behind the nonchalant words. As twilight painted the sky, urgent footsteps heralded Jones' arrival. "Confirmed – Bill Lin has departed. Fang Su remains housebound, while Ge Yinglai's whereabouts are unknown."

"Maintain surveillance," Guan Yu ordered, mind racing. If Fang Su lurked indoors while Bill Lin rallied Guan Yu's enemies, their collusion seemed inevitable. That old adversary's absence spoke volumes – undoubtedly orchestrating schemes from shadowed chambers.

The shrill ring of his smartphone shattered contemplation. Jia Bo's panicked voice erupted: "Boss! Our men are clashing with Ge Yinglai's gang downtown!"

"Engage them fully," Guan Yu commanded without hesitation. "Mobilize all three divisions. I'll join shortly – we strike mercilessly!"

As Xue Jing's yellow Beetle navigated backstreets toward the northern district, Guan Yu's strategic mind dissected the situation. This confrontation reeked of trap – Bill Lin's signature stratagem to drain their resources through attrition warfare.

The scene unfolding downtown confirmed suspicions. Two bloodied Yu Gang members lay surrounded by thugs, while corrupt officers turned blind eyes. Guan Yu's lips thinned. Direct intervention would play into enemy hands, risking legal entanglements. Instead, he deployed Jiang Fenju – their operative melted into the crowd, smartphone aloft.

"Documenting police brutality!" Jiang's amplified voice rallied bystanders. When baton-wielding officers charged, he danced through the mob like will-o'-the-wisp, inciting citizens to film the injustice. The orchestrated chaos collapsed under public scrutiny, assailants scattering like cockroaches beneath light.

**Chapter 2642: Internet Café Brawl**

As Guan Yu retreated from the dissolving conflict, another distress call arrived. "Qian Family Internet Café's under attack!" Jia Bo reported. "Even our injured and female members are targeted!"

Guan Yu's knuckles whitened on the car door. "Have Wei Hongwei stand by. Contact Hou Jinshun – immediate reinforcement to Qian's establishment!"

Xue Jing accelerated through amber lights. "Bill Lin's cunning exceeds expectations. These coordinated strikes..."

"Precisely," Guan Yu grimaced. "Death by a thousand cuts. He seeks to bleed our numbers and resources dry." His mind cataloged recent events – downtown skirmish, internet café assault, surely more to follow. Each required measured response to avoid legal snares while protecting assets.

At the vandalized internet café, Hou Jinshun surveyed the carnage. A young woman lay bleeding, face cruelly slashed. "Who dares maim innocents?" he thundered, strategic fury kindling. Behind him, twenty enforcers barred exits. The real battle was just beginning.

**Chapter 2643: Strategic Respite**

"Clear the wounded!" Hou barked. As underlings carried the disfigured girl out, he addressed the trembling crowd: "Witnesses will testify. Those responsible..." His glare swept the room, "...won't enjoy police custody."

Meanwhile, Guan Yu analyzed patterns from the moving vehicle. "Bill Lin's testing our response times. Next strike will likely..." His phone buzzed with fresh reports even as he spoke.

Xue Jing gripped the steering wheel tighter. "We're playing whack-a-mole across the city. How long can we sustain this?"

"Long enough to discern their command chain," Guan Yu replied, eyes glinting with predatory calculation. "Let them believe we're reactive. Soon, we'll sever the hydra's heads."

As night deepened, the game escalated. Bill Lin's forces harried from multiple fronts, but Guan Yu's countermeasures unfolded like precision clockwork – legal challenges met with public exposure, brute force countered by strategic withdrawals, each move designed to stretch enemy resources thinner than their own. The true battle wasn't in streets or cybercafés, but in the invisible war of logistics and endurance. And Guan Yu intended to win both.
