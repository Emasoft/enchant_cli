Guan Yu swept his gaze around, preparing to dash back to campus when his eyes suddenly paused. "Hmm?" he uttered softly.

Near this slum area lay a nearly abandoned small lake that emitted foul odors every summer, particularly at night. Because of this, passersby never lingered after dark.

With his extraordinary vision, Guan Yu clearly saw a white-clad figure bending over and searching for something by the lake. The silhouette looked familiar.

Xue Jing. What was this naive young mistress doing here?

The world felt both vast and small. The girl rummaging by the malodorous lake was none other than Xue Jing, whom Guan Yu had encountered in the park days earlier. Remembering how she had impulsively proposed eloping with him, Guan Yu felt a headache coming on. First Xue Jing, then that befuddled old lady—this year seemed full of eccentric characters.

Guan Yu glanced warily at Xue Jing. Confirming she hadn't noticed him, he considered slipping away. Yet the thought of leaving a young woman alone in this dangerous area gnawed at his conscience. With a resigned sigh, he resolved to help.

As he hesitated, his brows suddenly furrowed. His sharp senses detected five figures approaching rapidly from his right—their auras peculiar and movements unnaturally swift.

These weren't the same people from before. Their energy signatures differed, stronger than Cat Eye's group. From their trajectory, their target was clearly Xue Jing.

What background did this girl have to warrant multiple superhuman operatives? Shaking his head, Guan Yu couldn't abandon her. Though they'd only met once, her guileless kindness was evident. With his chivalrous nature, how could he not intervene?

As he stepped forward, Guan Yu paused again. "More are coming," he murmured. Recognizing familiar energy signatures, he smirked. "Seems like last time's crew. Let's watch the show first." He melted into the shadows.

At his current cultivation level, few could detect him when he concealed himself.

Xue Jing remained oblivious to the approaching danger, still searching by the lake. Guan Yu wondered how she tolerated the stench as she occasionally hopped about.

Five black-clad figures materialized on the road—muscular, imposing men whose mere presence thickened the air with pressure. Notably, they carried no weapons. Guan Yu frowned. While most superhumans didn't rely on arms, he recalled being told only a few dozen mutated humans existed worldwide. This sudden concentration puzzled him.

Since when had superpowers become so common?

"Miss Xue, long time no see," a chilling voice echoed.

Xue Jing jerked her head up. Seeing the five men, she gasped. "Who are you?"

Though naive, she recognized their hostility. Her hand darted to her waist, retrieving a communication device.

"Now, now, Miss Xue," the central black-clad man drawled, raising a hand crackling with electricity. Before she could react, her device sparked and smoked, rendered useless.

Guan Yu clearly saw the lightning arc from the man's hand strike the device's core. Xue Jing stared at the ruined gadget in panic. "What do you want?!"

"No need for alarm," another黑衣人soothed. "We merely wish to invite you for tea." His four companions began encircling her.

Xue Jing retreated until the fetid lake lapped at her heels. Watching from shadows, Guan Yu frowned. "Is she planning to jump in?" He imagined her floundering in the muck.

The stench grew overpowering as the lake neared. Xue Jing's face twisted not in despair, but indignation. Drowning in sewage? What an undignified end for a young mistress! She hadn't even experienced love or adventure!

Strangely, her thoughts turned not to family, but to Guan Yu—the man who'd rescued her before.

With a sigh, Guan Yu decided to intervene. Raising his hand, he manipulated spatial distances—a feat far more complex than personal teleportation.

A minute's distance away, Cat Eye's group paled when Xue Jing's signal died. They accelerated frantically—then froze. The scenery before them warped, suddenly revealing Xue Jing's predicament 100 meters ahead.

"Stop them!" Cat Eye roared, muscles coiling as he exploded forward. His team followed, bewildered but determined.

"Cat!" snarled a黑衣人. "I'll intercept them!" Four others lunged for Xue Jing.

Seeing reinforcements, Xue Jing leapt toward the lake—only for a黑衣人's arm to grotesquely elongate and snag her.

Cat Eye's fist, sheathed in meteoric iron gloves, smashed into a黑衣人's chest. Instead of resisting, the man's torso ballooned like a bladder. The blow sank deep—then rebounded with terrifying force, sending Cat Eye flying.

"Silkworm Transformation!" Cat Eye spat blood, recognizing the elasticity-based mutation that countered brute strength.

His team surged past to rescue Xue Jing, but the黑衣人easily repelled them. Even enhanced, they were outmatched.

"Die saving the young mistress then!" Cat Eye bellowed. His men paired up—one transferring energy to the other before collapsing. Empowered, the recipients fought harder.

Guan Yu's eyes widened. Humans had developed power transference? This reckless technology could enable tyrants to amass catastrophic strength. He resolved to eradicate such methods.

The boosted fighters initially gained ground, but the黑衣人adapted defensively. As their borrowed power waned, desperation set in.

"Now!" Cat Eye roared. His team abandoned defense, suicidally charging Xue Jing's captor. Bones cracked and blood sprayed as they battered the黑衣人into releasing her.

"Uncle Cat!" Xue Jing wept, witnessing their sacrifice. "This is my fault! I'll never disobey again!"

Panting and bleeding, Cat Eye's team formed a human shield. The lead黑衣人taunted, "You think you can escape? Your master can't save you now."

Cat Eye's heart sank—their enemy knew too much. This was an elaborate trap.

"Transfer your energy to me!" a subordinate urged. "Take the young mistress and flee!"

As they prepared this final gambit, Guan Yu emerged from shadows. "Enough."

His voice froze all combatants. Energy crackled around him as he declared, "This ends now."
