“An Earth-rank technique? Impossible! Such techniques should be exceedingly rare. How could one casually appear at an auction?”

After some discussion among the crowd, Guan Yu saw Bai Xuelan on the high platform wave her hand gently and declare, “Silence! I just heard someone claim this is an Earth-rank technique. Let me correct that person—you are mistaken!”

“See? I told you! This can’t be an Earth-rank technique. Most cultivators on the continent now practice Mysterious-rank upper-grade techniques. Even Earth-rank techniques commonly seen are ordinary ones. Rare or lost techniques are nearly impossible to encounter!”

“Indeed! The value of such techniques isn’t just their rarity. More importantly, they have no natural counters. Once unleashed, few can withstand them. In a way, these techniques are invincible!”

Guan Yu listened in astonishment. So cultivating rare techniques held such advantages! Yet he hadn’t even mastered common techniques, let alone rare ones.

“Elder Bai, are you mocking us? We’ve waited half the day, only for you to present a Mysterious-rank technique? What’s the meaning of this? Do you think us too poor to afford better?”

“Exactly! I, Old Biao, refuse to leave until real treasures are unveiled! Otherwise, I’ll camp here indefinitely!”

“Count me in!”

“And me!”

As discontent rippled through the crowd, Bai Xuelan remained unflustered, as if she had anticipated—or orchestrated—this reaction. With a faint smile, she announced, “When I said this technique isn’t Earth-rank, I meant to reveal its true nature—this is a Heaven-rank technique!”

“What?!”

“Heaven-rank?!”

The room erupted in shock. A Heaven-rank technique lay before them—a treasure considered priceless and nearly unobtainable. Even with boundless wealth, securing one was no guarantee.

Moreover, obtaining such a technique didn’t ensure mastery. Heaven-rank techniques demanded profound comprehension, whether for martial or magical cultivation. Without exceptional talent, a practitioner might lose to someone wielding a Mysterious-rank technique.

Yet for those with matching aptitude, higher-tier techniques offered overwhelming advantages. For Great Swordsmen or Archmages, a Heaven-rank technique could triple—even quintuple—their combat prowess. Typically, such experts used Mysterious-rank upper-grade or Earth-rank lower-grade techniques. Access to Heaven-rank methods would utterly suppress opponents.

As the crowd buzzed, Bai Xuelan’s expression shifted. “I have two announcements—one good, one bad. Which would you hear first?”

“The good news!” came the unified cry.

“Very well. The good news is I spoke truth—this is indeed a Heaven-rank technique. The bad news? It’s incomplete, containing only two-thirds of the original.”

“Incomplete?!”

Many nearly collapsed. They’d readied tens of thousands of gold coins for a Heaven-rank bidding war, only to learn it was fragmentary! Their hopes plummeted from peaks to abyss.

The reason was simple: Heaven-rank techniques were created by pinnacle experts. Modifying or completing such works required even greater imagination and control—tasks for legends among legends. Without the missing third, this scroll was useless. None present could restore it.

**Chapter 1299: The Game of Tycoons**

Spending fortunes on an incomplete technique appealed to none. As debates over its worth raged, Huang Wensheng nudged Guan Yu. “Brother Guan, why so quiet? Is this the treasure you awaited?”

Guan Yu snapped from his thoughts. “No, my target remains later. Perhaps it won’t surface today.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu himself didn’t know what he awaited. Without funds, naming a desired item would require producing corresponding gold—an impossibility for his empty pockets.

“Nonsense! With your apparent wealth, seize opportunities! Remember—‘Opportunity knocks but once!’”

Guan Yu nearly choked. *I’ve fooled him into thinking I’m rich? Imagine his face when the truth emerges!*

Onstage, Bai Xuelan smiled. “You must crave details about this Heaven-rank technique. Yet even I lack them.”

“What? The seller doesn’t know? Then it’s likely fraudulent!”

“Alternatively, its Heaven-rank status is unverified!”

“Such an unreliable technique can’t command high prices!”

“Regarding price—the seller sets the minimum bid at 10,000 gold coins.”

Gasps filled the hall. Who would pay such sums for an ambiguous fragment? Without the missing portion, it was worthless trash. Spending 10,000 gold here wasn’t wealth—it was idiocy!

Amidst hesitant silence, Bai Xuelan added, “No pressure to buy. The seller seeks a destined owner. If none emerges, the price doubles!”

“By heavens! What seller is this? If he craves gold, why not rob people? Why swindle buyers with this rubbish?”

“Exactly! I’ve coin to spare, but won’t feed parasites!”

“Boycott it! Let none purchase!”

As outcries swelled, Bai Xuelan raised a hand. “Non-bidders may refrain from heckling. Further disruptions will have guards escort offenders out.”

Instantly, silence fell. All feared the Golden Auction House’s backing—its endurance across thousands of kilometers relied on housing supreme experts. Rumors spoke of five Sword Kings and even a peak Sword Emperor among their ranks. A Sword Emperor matched a Grand Magister, meaning this house alone rivaled elven might—a reason humans dominated the Blue Beauty Continent.

Satisfied, Bai Xuelan resumed, “My warning targeted disruption, not dialogue. Now, this Heaven-rank technique lacks any bid. Does none desire it? If no offers emerge within ten counts, I’ll regrettably withdraw it.”

Most faces remained stony—useless exorbitant techniques couldn’t compete with tangible elixirs or weapons. As Bai Xuelan counted down—“Ten… nine… eight… seven…”—she scanned the room. Finding no takers, she sighed. “Three… two… one…”

“12,000 gold!”

At the final moment, a voice rang from a corner. All turned to stare—Guan Yu craned his neck—spotting a gaunt, black-robed man in an obscure seat, impervious to mockery.

“Who’s that fool?”

“Fool? That’s Xia Tianfeng, young master of the Black Dragon Mercenary Group! His father leads both the group and the Dark Mercenary Alliance!”

The crowd hushed. Bai Xuelan recognized him instantly, her smile deepening. “Young Master Xia! I’d thought this technique unwanted. How mistaken I was!”

Just as Xia Tianfeng’s bid seemed secure, another voice interjected—“15,000 gold!”

“Madness! Who dares challenge Xia Tianfeng now?”

The bidder—Murong Yu, earlier victim of the third auction—locked eyes with his rival. Xia Tianfeng sneered. “20,000 gold!”

Gasps erupted. Murong Yu hesitated, then growled, “25,000 gold!”

**Chapter 1300: I’ll Buy It For You**

The crowd cheered the duel—wealthy games amused them. Xia Tianfeng escalated ruthlessly: “35,000 gold!”

Bai Xuelan glowed—this far exceeded expectations. As Murong Yu prepared to counter, his steward Han Yuanqing tugged his sleeve. “Young Master, our funds dwindle!”

Murong Yu seethed. The feud with Black Dragon began during a crystal toad hunt at Tigerhead Mountain. If not for Xia Tianfeng’s sister Xia Yue’er and her moonlight mirror, Guan Yu (now supposedly dead) wouldn’t have stolen the prize. With that toad, Murong Yu could’ve advanced beyond Great Swordsman!

“Steward, check our remaining gold!”

“Young Master… we have 50,000 left.”

“Enough!” Murong Yu smirked. “Even if I lose, I’ll inflate the price! Xia Tianfeng, enjoy the show!”

Bai Xuelan drawled, “Does Young Master Murong concede? Silence awards the prize to Xia Tianfeng.”

Murong Yu sprang up. “Since Young Master Xia covets this, I’ll simplify matters—50,000 gold! Take it if you dare!”

The hall froze. Guan Yu’s jaw dropped—50,000 gold equated to five million in mortal terms! Only fools or tycoons spent thus.

Xia Tianfeng bristled. *Murong Yu turns the trap on me!* He prepared to raise further when a new voice chimed:

“50,001 gold!”

Laughter stifled as all sought the bidder—Huang Wensheng, rising beside Guan Yu.

“Brother Huang!” Guan Yu gaped. “You’d buy this scrap?”

“Scrap? This is genuine treasure! A Heaven-rank technique—do you comprehend its value?”

Guan Yu vaguely grasped tiers from Mysterious to Earth ranks, but Heaven-rank’s might eluded him.
