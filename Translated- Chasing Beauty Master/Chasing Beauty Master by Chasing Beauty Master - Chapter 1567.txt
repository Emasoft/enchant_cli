The proprietor halted and gestured, declaring, “Sir, take a look at these steeds. Each has been meticulously selected for their unmatched swiftness—ordinary horses could never hope to rival them. Please inspect them at your leisure.”

Guan Yu paced back and forth, scrutinizing the horses. They were indeed fine specimens; the proprietor had not exaggerated their quality. Yet compared to the red stallion he had glimpsed earlier, these fell short. A white mare among them caught his eye, but even it paled beside the crimson beauty.

Shaking his head, Guan Yu remarked, “These are adequate, but none compare to that red stallion outside.”

The proprietor’s expression tightened. “Sir, I can see you’re a discerning judge of horses. That red stallion is exceptional, but it has… a temperament. It refuses to be ridden. The moment anyone mounts it, chaos ensues. Just last month, a young nobleman was thrown and gravely injured. I had to compensate his family handsomely. Believe me, I’d gladly sell it—it’s been languishing here for half a year—but its ferocity makes it impossible. I’m at my wit’s end!”

“Is that so?” Guan Yu’s eyes gleamed. “Then let me attempt to tame it.”

“You may try,” the proprietor cautioned, raising a finger, “but any injuries are your responsibility. I cannot afford further liabilities.”

Guan Yu turned abruptly. “First, name your price for the white mare.”

A sly smile flickered across the proprietor’s face. “Ah, that one? A superb choice! Bred on northern grasslands, its coat gleams like polished jade, and its speed leaves rivals in the dust. Acquiring it cost me fifty taels. After a month’s upkeep, I’ll part with it for seventy—a steal compared to the usual hundred!”

“If you’re not turning a profit,” Guan Yu retorted dryly, “perhaps slaughtering it for meat would serve you better. I’ll revisit the red stallion.”

The proprietor’s smile vanished as Guan Yu strode away. Muttering curses under his breath, he trailed behind.

In the courtyard, the red stallion stood regal, its coat blazing like sunset. Guan Yu’s resolve hardened—this mount would prove indispensable for royal escorts and desert crossings alike. “Name your price,” he demanded.

“Price?” The proprietor chuckled nervously. “First survive a ride around the yard. But remember—any mishaps are yours alone to bear. Even seasoned trainers have failed. One veteran broke his neck when it trampled him. I’ve forbidden further attempts.”

Guan Yu snorted. “Save your warnings. State the price.”

“A hundred taels,” the proprietor blurted. “Paid that sum myself to a desperate youth. A purebred rarity!”

Guan Yu smirked. The lie was transparent—no stable paid such sums. “Fifty taels,” he countered, approaching the stallion.

The beast met his gaze, proud eyes flashing defiance. As Guan Yu reached to stroke its neck, it snorted warningly, muscles coiling. Undeterred, Guan Yu roared—a thunderclap of sound. The stallion reared, hooves slashing air where Guan Yu had stood moments before.

Dancing back, Guan Yu timed his leap perfectly. As the stallion charged, he vaulted onto its back. The proprietor gasped. “Madman!”

The stallion erupted into frenzy—bucking, spinning, arching vertically to dislodge its rider. Guan Yu clung like a burr, fingers tangled in crimson mane. Sweat slicked his palms as the beast’s fury mounted.

Channeling spiritual energy, Guan Yu lightened his body, hovering above the saddle. Confused, the stallion slowed. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu dropped his full weight, reinforced by inner qi. The stallion’s knees buckled, crashing it to the dirt.

“Impossible!” The proprietor gaped as Guan Yu leaned close to the panting beast. “Yield,” he murmured, “or remain here forever.”

Slowly, the stallion’s head lowered. Guan Yu eased the pressure. Instantly, the horse surged up—only to freeze as mountainous weight returned. Three times this dance repeated before the proud neck finally stayed bowed.

“Fifty taels,” Guan Yu stated, dismounting. The proprietor nodded dumbly, too stunned to haggle.

Thus the crimson demon met its master, not through brutality, but through wisdom that bent even wild hearts to will.
