“Senior Brother, what a decisive judgment. Imposing restrictions on you would naturally be impossible, yet when you greedily took that Apricot Yellow Banner years ago, you should have known full well that until the day you become sect leader, you cannot fully control it. Should circumstances change, being controlled by others was inevitable.” Ye Qingfeng slowly approached Yin Ye, gazing at this once-beloved senior brother now fallen to such a state, his heart a tumult of mixed emotions.

“Heh. You and your father schemed for years. Elder Daoxu spoke truly - your family only thinks of yourselves. Common disciples like us are mere chess pieces in your eyes.” Having realized his utter helplessness, Yin Ye rapidly calmed himself, his icy stare fixed on Ye Qingfeng.

“Enough. I’ve no wish to bandy words. For years, how did our family treat you? And how did you repay us? Elder Daoxu?” Ye Qingfeng chuckled coldly. “You’ve merely changed hands from one chess player to another. What difference does it make? Truthfully, Senior Brother, had you truly resisted, who could have compelled you? This is but the insatiable greed of the human heart.” With a derisive snort, Ye Qingfeng seized Yin Ye and vanished, showing neither concern nor care for Yan Qing.

Elsewhere, Yan Qing discovered his own escape routes had vanished.

“Speak your piece quickly. This may be your final opportunity.” Guan Yu regarded the man before him with wry amusement. This same man had once inflicted unprecedented humiliation upon him when he first entered the cultivation world. Now, glancing at the spiritual sword in his hand, Guan Yu laughed mirthlessly.

“Nothing remains to be said. Reaching this juncture was my miscalculation - inferior strength, indecisiveness. Had I slain you before the sect gates then, subsequent events would never have occurred. Nor would defeat have festered into inner demons, tormenting me until this end. Guan Yu... that defeat rankled. Let us clash once more.” Yan Qing slowly turned, suddenly realizing he had nowhere left to retreat.

“Very well. Let us battle.” Complex emotions surged through Guan Yu. Though this opponent wasn’t evil, his death remained necessary - a matter beyond mere right or wrong.

Guan Yu’s blade trembled, violet lightning crackling as he unleashed the Seven Stars Sword Art. The Golden Core-level technique fused with his personal insights into swordsmanship unleashed power far beyond Yan Qing’s anticipation.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

“Heh. Blocking thirteen strikes. Pity...” As their positions shifted, blood droplets cascaded from the tip of Guan Yu’s quivering blade.

“You think victory assured? Guan Yu, it’s precisely this arrogance that disgusts me most.” A fierce glint flashed in Yan Qing’s eyes as his sword flew back to hand. Maintaining sword flight in the mortal realm proved no easy feat.

“Let us decide life and death.”

Shadows blurred as fanaticism burned in Yan Qing’s gaze.

“Thunk!”

The sickening sound of steel piercing flesh echoed, yet no triumph showed on Guan Yu’s face - only solemn gravity.

“Even in death... I’ll make you suffer. Cough... Leave an arm behind!” With his heart pierced, Yan Qing mustered final strength to swing his glowing azure blade.

“Clang!”

The sword rebounded harmlessly from Guan Yu’s shoulder.

“Cough... Spirit Robe... Heh... Luck favors you...” Yan Qing’s fading voice slurred as he collapsed, eyes closing, lips curving in a final enigmatic smile.

“Perhaps death is your proper归宿 now.” Closing his eyes, Guan Yu grappled with unprecedented complexity towards a fallen foe.

Returning to the villa, Guan Yu found Yin Ye restrained like a beaten cur, malice burning uselessly in his eyes. Dismissing the condemned man, Guan Yu addressed the youth sipping red wine.

“Your spirits seem low. Do the dead weigh on your conscience?” Ye Qingfeng’s serene smile provoked violent impulses in Guan Yu.

“Know this - I detest such tones. Today, as Qingling’s brother, I’ll indulge you. Next time... And learn guest etiquette - don’t touch what isn’t yours.” A dangerous glint flashed as Guan Yu ascended the stairs, ignoring the stunned youth.

“Fascinating. You dislike being manipulated?” Watching Guan Yu depart, Ye Qingfeng felt an unfamiliar chill.

Alone in his room, Guan Yu exhaled deeply. Nearly deceived by Ye Qingfeng’s blunt manner masking imperious commands - first using Ye Qingling to silence objections, then clouding judgment with benefits, leaving Guan Yu no recourse but compliance.

“Golden Light, why must humans scheme so?” Slumping wearily, Guan Yu voiced uncharacteristic fatigue. Eliminating Yan Qing left him chafing against manipulation, yearning for true freedom.

“Humans, as spiritual beings, inevitably harbor passions and cunning. Master need only keep conscience clear - such matters warrant no concern.” The shimmering Golden Light orbited Guan Yu, recognizing this vulnerability appeared solely in private.

“Easy words. To control destiny requires both power and wisdom. Will you aid me?” Guan Yu recognized shared plight - no mortal enmity with Yan Qing, yet necessity demanded the kill. Weakness meant death. Witnessing both Yan Qing and Yin Ye’s fates crystallized his resolve: strength above all.

“Naturally, Master. We share destiny. I pray the Demon Subduing Sect’s legacy flourishes through you.” Golden Light’s chuckle lightened the mood.

“Then let us begin by teaching our Kunlun guest proper scheming.” Exhaling slowly, Guan Yu acknowledged Ye Qingfeng’s strategic correctness yet resented his brother-in-law’s overbearing manner.

Within minutes, Guan Yu mastered his emotions - familiar terrain from past turmoil. Vent, reflect, then confront.

Ye Qingfeng had caught him unprepared, yet neither truly lost - the Kunlun scion captured his target while Guan Yu eliminated a rival.

Unlike Ye Qingfeng, Guan Yu’s attachments lay in the mortal realm. Leaving vengeful cultivators alive risked his lovers’ safety. But now, possessing the Demon Subduing Sect’s stronghold granted newfound confidence.

“Brother Guan, my sibling summons you.” Ye Qingling’s crystalline voice announced her presence.

“How shameless. Yet perhaps such opportunists become true overlords.” Though despising Ye Qingfeng’s tactics, Guan Yu couldn’t ignore Qingling’s plea.

“Enter, Qingling. We must talk.” Resigned to compromise, Guan Yu accepted responsibility - though committing nothing improper, his word bound him to claim Qingling.

“Brother... Are you unhappy?” The girl’s timid query revealed fragile sensitivity. Since their nominal engagement, she sensed his discontent.

“Why say so? What displeasure could I have?” Guan Yu clasped her trembling hand, first intimate contact as acknowledged lovers, soothing the tense maiden.

“Don’t deceive me. I know my brother’s nature. Despite others’ praise, his surface bluntness masks Father’s Kunlun-devoted ruthlessness. Marrying me will burden you, won’t it?” Her fragmented anxiety conveyed clear understanding of his resentment.

“Fret not. As your brother, I’ll avoid conflict. His aims don’t oppose mine. Return to Kunlun and await my formal proposal.” Gently tapping her forehead, Guan Yu half-deceived, unwilling to involve her in complexities beyond her years.

“I...”

“Hush. Trust me.” Drawing her into an embrace, he silenced further protests.

“You... How dare!” Blushing like startled hare, Qingling fled.

Chuckling, Guan Yu watched her retreat, warmth in his gaze. Knowing his emotional debts, he vowed to shield his women from unnecessary burdens.

“Apologies for tardiness.” Guan Yu greeted the assembled company’s peculiar stares with clasped hands.

“Brother Guan’s conquest speed merits... discussion.” Zhang Ziran’s leer earned universal disdain.

“Brother Ye, shall we discuss plans?” Guan Yu ignored the rogue, addressing Ye Qingfeng.

“With all present, let us deliberate Kunlun’s proposal.” At the oval table’s head, Ye Qingfeng sent documents floating to attendees - Kunlun’s undisputed dominance evident.

“You jest, Brother Ye. Are we Kunlun vassals?” Yun Xuanwu froze her copy to dust.

“Is this the consensus?” Ye Qingfeng’s chilling composure cracked slightly - unprecedented defiance towards the orthodox sect.

“Sister Yun speaks for all. Weren’t suggestions invited?” Zhang Ziran sneered.

“Amitabha. Given Kunlun nearly eradicated us, such arrogance fits.” Fanon’s bluntness cut deeper.

“Exterminating demons? Where? How? Will Kunlun elders act?” Zuo Qingyi’s cold critique further inflamed matters.

“You...” Ye Qingfeng rose angrily, unprepared for universal opposition despite his impending sect leadership.

“This plan reeks. Should its author witness reality before pontificating? Kunlun demands four-tenths of demon assets for nothing?” Guan Yu’s icy rebuke struck hardest.

The assembly’s resentment stemmed from recent near-death in Yin Ye’s machinations - Kunlun’s heir offering neither apology nor contrition, merely assuming command.

“Very well. Enlighten me regarding mortal rules.” Mastering fury, Ye Qingfeng conceded.

“As the sole mortal here, I’ll explain.” Guan Yu outlined principles: civilian protection, non-interference, equal cooperation with secular authorities. “You should appreciate this after recent events.”

The gathering’s hostility reflected lingering trauma from Kunlun’s schemes. Ye Qingfeng’s presumptuous leadership proved intolerable.

“Since Brother Guan lectures so eloquently, present your anti-demon strategy.” Regaining composure, Ye Qingfeng counterattacked.

Guan Yu recognized the shifted dynamic - though checkmated temporarily, Ye Qingfeng remained formidable. The true game had just begun.
