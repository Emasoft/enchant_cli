Sun Xu, though fearful of Guan Yu, knew he had to take this risk for his future—collaborating with Guan Yu.

During their time at the Feng residence, Sun Xu had only just regained enough mobility to sit in a wheelchair when Bill Lin sent them out under the guise of “letting them get some fresh air.” In truth, they were being expelled.

With their power utterly destroyed, Bill Lin now saw them as useless wastes of resources. It was simpler to cast them out than continue feeding them.

Another expelled companion, Ge Yinglai, fared no better. Like Sun Xu, his tendons had been severed, and both were unceremoniously ejected by Bill Lin.

Yet Ge Yinglai’s luck held. After his forces were crushed by the Yu Gang, they hadn’t been absorbed. Once free, he rallied many loyal followers back to his side.

Sun Xu, however, faced a bleaker reality. With his leather factory seized and renamed by Guan Yu, his sole power base crumbled. Most former subordinates now worked under Guan Yu, their loyalty dissolved. Survival here demanded pragmatism—no one would follow a crippled has-been.

Since Guan Yu took over, working conditions and wages improved drastically. To the workers, Sun Xu became a stranger, ignored as they relished their newfound stability.

Still, a few diehard loyalists remained—those deeply indebted to Sun Xu. They bided their time in the factory, awaiting their moment.

Guan Yu lounged on a sofa, smirking at Sun Xu. “You seem to be getting by.”

“Thanks to your mercy in sparing my life,” Sun Xu replied stiffly, discomforted by that mocking smile.

“I spared you not to oppose me again,” Guan Yu said coldly. “Choose your allegiance wisely.”

“I only came to retrieve personal belongings,” Sun Xu argued. “Your men detained me. Our feud should be over—is this necessary?”

“Over?” Guan Yu’s voice sharpened. “You led hundreds to my doorstep on Bill Lin’s orders, seeking my family’s blood. Do you think that debt vanishes so easily?”

Sun Xu tensed. Clearly, Guan Yu hadn’t forgotten. Yet what threat could a broken man pose now?

“I’ve paid dearly for crossing you,” Sun Xu pleaded. “Must you hound a cripple?”

“I don’t hunt you,” Guan Yu said. “But cross me again, and your borrowed time expires.”

Sun Xu recognized the futility of resistance. In A City, Guan Yu stood unchallenged—a colossus versus a beggar.

**Chapter 2909: Revelry**

“I seek only my possessions,” Sun Xu insisted. “Must I beg permission to collect clothes?”

“Everything here is mine,” Guan Yu countered. “My men showed restraint by not beating you senseless. Be grateful.”

Defeated, Sun Xu switched tactics. “Some items hold sentimental value—my parents’ heirlooms. They’re worthless to you. Let me take them, and I’ll vanish from your life.”

Guan Yu knew Sun Xu’s history—orphaned young after his parents perished in a plane crash, inheriting wealth that funded his rise as a delinquent kingpin. The leather factory was his last legacy.

“Why should I trust you?” Guan Yu sneered. “Were our positions reversed, you’d show less mercy.”

“Search with me then,” Sun Xu offered desperately. “You’ll see I want only mementos.”

Curious, Guan Yu agreed, assigning Wang Hu and guards to monitor him. The group moved toward the dormitory’s sixth floor—a climb impossible for Sun Xu’s wheelchair.

“Carry me up,” Sun Xu begged, offering cash.

Guan Yu laughed. “My men don’t grovel for pennies.”

Xue Jing proposed retrieving the items themselves, but Sun Xu insisted on personal supervision. Guan Yu’s suspicion hardened.

“Leave before I lose patience,” Guan Yu finally growled. “You’re beneath even a dog in my eyes.”

Defeated, Sun Xu retreated. Guan Yu knew this charade masked deeper schemes—likely connected to recent factory thefts.

“Replace all his old lackeys with our men,” Guan Yu ordered Wang Hu. “Root out the rot.”

As they departed, crisis struck again—Bill Lin was publicly courting Qu Shuangshuang at their school gate, a floral battalion in tow. Guan Yu stormed toward the confrontation, rage simmering.

The stage was set for new clashes, old grudges far from settled.
