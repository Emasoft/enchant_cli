“The flavor is quite good,” Guan Yu remarked, “though having frequently partaken of roasted meats in my wandering days before meeting Your Highness, I’m not easily moved by such fare. Back then, though we seldom tasted delicacies, game from the mountains often filled our bellies—ha!”

His words held truth. In lean times, those adrift in the martial world would hunt wild game—hares, pheasants, and the like—to roast over flames.

The Prince chuckled. “Ah, you humble me, Brother Yu. You’re right. Before inheriting my title, during a mission where my purse was stolen, I once slept beneath a tree in the mountains. Starving and penniless, I caught a pheasant to roast.”

“So even Your Highness has such tales!” Magistrate Mao flattered. “You must have been a gallant wanderer like Brother Yu in those days?”

“Gallant? Hardly. But I did intervene often when justice demanded it.” The Prince’s voice brimmed with pride. Such interventions had once led him to save the Emperor himself.

“Divine aroma,” Xiao Zhi managed between mouthfuls, his plump face glistening with grease. The man’s voracity was as comical as it was baffling. Thankfully, the swelling on his face—courtesy of Du Bingyan’s salve—had nearly vanished.

Chapter 4014: A Clever Concept

“Eat your fill, Brother Zhi!” the Prince urged. “Magistrate Mao prepared this feast to honor you all.”

“My deepest thanks,” Xiao Zhi said, clasping his hands. “Never have I tasted such splendor. This honor flows from Your Highness’s grace and Magistrate Mao’s generosity.”

Rising, Guan Yu gestured outside. “Your Highness, the carpenter’s work is ready. This rough prototype demonstrates the concept. Refined craftsmanship would enhance its utility.”

He approached a table whose center bore four grooves. Inserting circular wooden blocks, he layered a smaller tabletop atop the larger base, leaving a forty-centimeter border for aesthetic balance. Seating himself, he declared, “Observe: each diner places their utensils here, while all dishes rest on this rotating surface. Simply turn it to bring any dish within reach—no servants needed to serve courses or pour wine.”

The Prince strode over, entourage in tow. “Marvelous! This solves every dining inconvenience. How did you conceive such brilliance?”

In truth, such “Lazy Susans” were commonplace in Guan Yu’s homeland, crafted from wood, glass, or even marble. But he demurred, “I merely adapted a design from an inn—the Handsome Heroes Lodge. Their master was no ordinary man.” He omitted mentioning how its owner, Yan Zhao, had nearly killed him there.

“This must be widely adopted!” the Prince exclaimed.

“Indeed,” Magistrate Mao agreed. “I’ll retrofit every table in my manor. Next visit, Brother Zhi needn’t strain for distant dishes!”

Laughter ensued, Xiao Zhi ruefully shaking his head.

As servants ushered them back for theatrical performances, Guan Yu noted a masked figure lurking—likely the assassin. But surrounded by guards and with Zou Wuxiao present, the threat seemed negligible.

The Prince raised his cup. “To Magistrate Mao’s hospitality! Despite perils on my journey, these days of respite—and the company of Brothers Yu, Zhi, and Wei—have steeled my resolve. We depart at dawn.”

“May Your Highness reach the capital safely to fulfill His Majesty’s decree!” Magistrate Mao toasted.

Outside the manor, Du Bingyan peered futilely at the guarded entrance. “Sir,” she implored a sentry, “I seek my friend Xiao Zhi. Might I enter?”

“Think this a peasant’s hut?” the soldier sneered. “Wait till he emerges.”

Undeterred, she slipped him silver. “Please, just announce me?”

Pocketing the bribe, he feigned reluctance. “Important guests dine within. Disturb them, and I’ll lose my head.”

“Thief!” she shouted, drawing bystanders. “You take silver then refuse aid? Such a dog deserves beating!”

“Whoreson liar!” the guard retorted. “Where’s your proof? Begone, lest I arrest you!”

When two more guards seized her, Du Bingyan spotted the petition drum. A desperate strike resounded through the compound.

Chapter 4015: Reckless Audacity

“Who dares?!” Magistrate Mao barked as the drum’s echo interrupted the revelry. “My apologies, Your Highness. I must attend to this.”

He stormed out to find Du Bingyan bound. “This shrew abused the guards and disturbed the peace!”

“Lies!” she cried. “I sought Xiao Zhi! That thief took my silver!”

“Release her!” Magistrate Mao thundered, recognizing Xiao Zhi’s name. “Who accepted bribes? You’ll answer for this!”

Turning to Du Bingyan, he softened. “Your friends are honored guests. Forgive this disgrace.”

Chapter 4016: Defying Heaven

As guards quailed, Du Bingyan pressed, “They’d jail me unjustly! I only wish to see Xiao Zhi!”

“Escort her inside—gently!” Magistrate Mao ordered. To the Prince, he explained, “A misunderstanding, Your Highness. This lady’s companions saved your life.”

The Prince smiled. “Then she’s most welcome. Let this incident teach vigilance against corruption.”

Thus Du Bingyan entered, her persistence rewarded—and a sentry’s greed marked for reckoning.
