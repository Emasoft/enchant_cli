“Agreeing to join the Móhún Sect seems to have resolved everything. This arrangement appears mutually beneficial.”

The Demon Lord chuckled, “Rest assured—even if I held such notions, I wouldn’t task you with them. Your true value lies in healing others. That shall remain your primary duty.”

Three-Heads bowed silently, his demeanor conveying satisfaction. The Demon Lord boomed with laughter, “Excellent! To celebrate your induction into our sect, tonight we’ll host a grand banquet in your honor.”

“May I see Xiaoqi now?”

“Of course. Truth be told, I’ve treated your young brother well. He’s playing in the rear courtyard with Rong’er. You may visit them.”

Three-Heads nodded deferentially. Having joined the sect, he now followed its protocols—bowing upon meeting and departing from the Demon Lord.

Entering the spacious rear garden adorned with blooming trees and flowing streams, Three-Heads immediately spotted Xiaoqi confined in a cage while Wang Xiaorong (Lotus) teased him. He recalled how the wolf demon had preferred human form since mastering shape-shifting, finding it more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.

Rushing forward, Three-Heads grabbed the cage. “Xiaoqi! Are you unharmed? Who dares imprison you? I’ll free you at once!”

He then noticed the cage’s peculiar nature—a spell-sealing prison forcing wolf demons like Xiaoqi to revert to true form while nullifying their magic, preventing human transformation.

“Impudence!” Wang Xiaorong snapped as Three-Heads attempted to open the cage. “Who are you to touch my belongings? Seek death?”

Their eyes met. Wang Xiaorong experienced sudden familiarity, though she couldn’t place his identity. Regardless, his audacity infuriated her—none dared handle her possessions so brazenly, not even the Left Envoy.

“Put that down! Who permitted your meddling?” she demanded coldly.

“This cage holds my sworn brother who dislikes confinement. Is freeing him wrong? Is this your promised care—imprisonment?” Three-Heads retorted.

Wang Xiaorong planted hands on hips, sneering, “Fool! Where else should we keep this wolf? Loose him and he’d flee! Whether he’s your brother matters not—I’m not done amusing myself. None shall touch him today!”

The Left Envoy approached urgently, having heard of Three-Heads’ recent induction. Conflict now threatened delicate negotiations. “This is misunderstanding! Young Mistress, Three-Heads—cease quarreling!”

“Left Envoy, perfect timing!” Wang Xiaorong complained. “Who is this intruder? Did he come to assassinate Father? He presumes to steal my wolf—utterly unreasonable!”

Three-Heads glared at the Envoy, gesturing at the cage. “You claimed Xiaoqi received proper care. Is this your definition?”

Chapter 3751: Grandeur

Tiger’s Maw Village originated when founder Yi Botian fled enemies to this desert-adjacent wasteland, shunned for its frequent sandstorms. After vanquishing foes, Yi deemed it auspicious ground, establishing permanent settlement.

Through generations, the village expanded beyond typical hamlet size. Natural shifts pushed deserts westward while villagers planted windbreak forests. Decades passed without major storms—whether from vegetation or desert retreat remained debated.

Current leader Lu Lian maintained low profile. Though rumors praised his heroism, few outsiders verified claims. The self-sufficient settlement recognized no official governance—Lu’s authority reigned supreme.

Entering the bustling village, Guan Yu noted typical market stalls lining streets. Yan Zhao suggested, “Lu Lian maintains ties with our Cloud Azure Sect. Let’s seek his hospitality through sect connections.”

“This entire area belongs to Tiger’s Maw?” Guan Yu inquired. “No government presence?”

“Correct,” Yan Zhao explained. “Lu Lian governs all here—effectively local magistrate.”

Xiao Zhi added, “They say Lu Lian welcomes guests. Our sect credentials should ensure warm reception.”

After inquiries, they reached the village center’s palatial compound—Lu Manor’s towering gates rivaled Cloud Azure’s mountain stronghold. The ten-meter portal bore a massive plaque declaring “LU MANOR”.

Xiao Zhi marveled, “Such grandeur! Master Lu enjoys his comforts.”

Yan Zhao warned, “Mind your tongues. Every resident here owes allegiance. Offending anyone risks collective wrath.”

Guan Yu noted approvingly—Yan Zhao displayed unexpected prudence beyond his womanizing reputation.

Four statue-like guards flanked the gates. Guan Yu smirked inwardly: Four sentries for mere gates? Either paranoia or extravagance.

Yan Zhao approached courteously. “Honorable guards, I’m Cloud Azure’s head disciple Yan Zhao. We seek audience with Master Lu during our mission to desert ruins.”

A guard sneered, “Cloud Azure? Daily we get sycophants seeking favors. Begone!”

Undeterred, Yan Zhao glanced at companions. Guan Yu suggested, “Let’s find lodgings elsewhere. Why court rejection?”

But Yan Zhao—penniless since squandering funds—insisted. After procuring silver from Xiao Zhi (pocketing half), he bribed a guard whose demeanor transformed instantly. “Esteemed guests! I’ll announce you immediately!”

Yan Zhao muttered returning, “Money talks, as ever.”

Guan Yu observed dryly, “Ancestral tradition—this ‘custom’ won’t change.”

The guard admired his silver en route. “Tonight’s pleasures secured! These sect fools throw money freely.”

Announced in Lu’s study, the lord contemplated—though disinclined to socialize, recent troubles warranted outside aid. “Receive them in main hall,” he ordered.

Chapter 3752: Protocol

The visitors entered an opulent hall where tea was served. Guan Yu sipped appreciatively—smooth, invigorating brew. Yan Zhao and Xiao Zhi performed elaborate courtesies before drinking.

Yan Zhao fawned, “Honored Master Lu, your legendary exploits reached even our remote sect. We, humble Cloud Azure disciples journeying to desert ruins, beg your hospitality.”

Lu Lian—mid-forties, average build, goateed with weary eyes—smiled graciously. “Cloud Azure’s presence honors this humble estate. Please, savor this premium tea.”

As Guan Yu noted the lord’s concealed spiritual energy, Yan Zhao continued flattery until Lu Lian raised a hand. “Young master flatters me. Truthfully, your timing proves fortuitous. A local matter requires outside resolution...”
