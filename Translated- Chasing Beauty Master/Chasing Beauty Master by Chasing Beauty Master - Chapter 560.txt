“In an instant, the crowd began raising their hands eagerly to follow Guan Yu. Seeing this, Guan Yu quickly said, “I need strong and courageous young men. That elder over there—please don’t join in needlessly!”

His words drew laughter, creating a warm atmosphere that momentarily dispelled the tension of impending crisis.

From over a hundred volunteers, Guan Yu selected thirty men. As they prepared to depart, they noticed Mayor Bard had vanished without a trace.

“That scoundrel of a mayor,” Guan Yu muttered. “Once we resolve the werewolf problem, I’ll make sure he pays!”

Ten minutes later, Guan Yu led the thirty-strong group toward the forest at dusk. They had to find the missing Xiaowei before nightfall.

“Brave souls of Barren Town,” Guan Yu declared, “you honor your home with your courage. But no one acts alone—we move as one. If anyone disagrees, speak now or withdraw freely.”

The group remained silent. Glancing toward the forest, Guan Yu added, “Since there are no objections, we press onward. I want no casualties—or this endeavor becomes futile.”

Half an hour later, they reached a forest entrance three hundred meters ahead, guided by Dapeng’s directions. Guan Yu’s heart grew uneasy as darkness thickened.

**Chapter 1418: A Fateful Encounter**

Upon entering the eerily silent forest, Guan Yu turned to Li Dapeng (Great Roc). “Are you certain this is the right spot? There’s no trace of anything here.”

Dapeng hesitated, doubting himself, but urged them to press forward. After fruitless searching, a shout pierced the gloom: “Young Master Guan Yu! Over here—signs of a struggle!”

Rushing over, Guan Yu found trampled grass and bloodstains faintly visible in the fading light. “This must be the place,” he thought.

Dapeng confirmed it, reigniting Guan Yu’s resolve. “But hours have passed,” someone interjected. “They’ve likely fled.”

“Our priority isn’t fighting werewolves,” Guan Yu countered. “It’s finding Xiaowei. Every moment counts!”

“But with this much blood,” another voice worried, “what if the werewolves already…?”

A thump silenced the speaker. “Idiot! Don’t jinx us! Xiaowei’s tough—he’ll pull through!”

Guan Yu organized teams of five to search safely. As their calls echoed through the trees, startling birds, he led Dapeng and Bika Cat deeper into the treacherous undergrowth.

Thorns snagged their clothes, oozing irritating sap. Dusk deepened into moonless dark beneath the dense canopy.

“Leader,” Dapeng asked, “can we still find him in this blackness?”

“We’ve come this far,” Guan Yu replied. “Turning back now would—”

“What if Xiaowei escaped and returned home?” Dapeng interrupted.

“Unlikely,” Guan Yu said grimly. “Once werewolves mark prey, survival is…” He trailed off at Dapeng’s uneasy glance. “Apologies. Let’s keep moving.”

A distant cry shattered the tension: “Emergency! Over here!”

Rushing toward torchlight, Guan Yu froze—the gathered figures weren’t werewolves, but humans led by a familiar foe: Murong Yu!

“Guan Yu!” Murong Yu laughed coldly. “Fate toys with us, meeting here!”

“The feeling’s mutual,” Guan Yu retorted. “Though ‘fate’ with you leans toward tragedy.”

**Chapter 1419: Provocations Without Remorse**

As Murong Yu’s white-haired advisor Chen Yaocheng demanded Guan Yu’s death, Bika Cat yawned. “Grandpa, did you escape the nursery? This forest’s no place for naptime.”

“Insolent beast!” Chen sputtered, face purpling.

“Beast?” Bika Cat tilted its head. “Says the bald tortoise hiding behind his master.”

Murong Yu sneered, “Since when do vermin speak?”

“Since fools started listening,” Guan Yu shot back. “Test its claws if you doubt.”

When Murong Yu hesitated, Chen growled, “Let me crush this arrogant whelp!”

“Crush?” Guan Yu smirked. “Bika, this fossil’s yours. Don’t strain yourself.”

Murong Yu’s men snickered until he silenced them. “Enough! Chen, uphold our honor!”

Trapped, the old mage stepped forward. “Prepare to meet your ancestors, brat!”

Guan Yu yawned. “Bika? This relic’s beneath me.”

As the cat stretched lazily, Barren Town’s youths cheered—their first taste of defiant pride in years.

**Chapter 1420: Man Versus Cat**

Chen’s staff glowed ominously. “Die, feline pest!”

Bika Cat dodged effortlessly. “Grandpa’s got arthritis! Need a warmer shawl?”

Murong Yu seethed as his men stifled laughs. “Chen! End this farce!”

But the cat toyed with the mage, claws sheathed. “Left! Right! Oops, almost tripped!”

Guan Yu crossed his arms, smirking. “Your ‘champion’ dances well. Trained him yourself?”

As Chen panted, humiliation burning brighter than his spells, the forest echoed with Barren Town’s newfound laughter—a sound long absent from their weary lives.
