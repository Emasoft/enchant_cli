“Wen Qing (Tenderness) and Feng Xin (Joyous Heart) didn’t continue their verbal sparring. Since the ‘official wife’ had already spoken, they naturally had to obey.

With nothing major left, the women headed upstairs to their rooms. Seizing a quiet moment, Wen Qing stealthily approached Guan Yu and whispered, ‘Honey, I’ll sneak into your room tonight. Remember to wait for me!’

Guan Yu’s waning spirit instantly revived, nodding eagerly like a chick pecking rice.

Wen Qing covered her mouth with a chuckle and went upstairs.

In high spirits, Guan Yu hummed a tune as he ascended, noticing Mo Ling helping Liu Shilei carry cosmetics to her room.

Smiling, Guan Yu asked, ‘Lingling, need any help?’

Mo Ling stared into his eyes, scrutinizing him until he squirmed before declaring, ‘Hmph, don’t get any ideas. I’ll lock my door tonight.’

With that, she left, leaving Guan Yu standing there bemused.

Watching her retreat, Guan Yu stroked his chin and mused, ‘Not a bad idea, actually.’

**Chapter 824: A Dream of Three Sharing a Bed**

Guan Yu waited impatiently for nightfall, lying in bed imagining what outfit Wen Qing would wear.

A soft knock interrupted his thoughts.

‘Maybe a nurse costume?’

He flung the door open, only to freeze at the sight of Feng Xin.

‘Xin’er, what brings you here so late?’ he asked awkwardly.

Feng Xin glanced around furtively, slipping into his room. Avoiding his gaze, she murmured, ‘They’re all asleep... I wouldn’t come otherwise.’

Guan Yu’s expression turned incredulous.

Before he could react, another knock came. Wen Qing tiptoed in, her smile fading as she noticed Feng Xin.

‘What are *you* doing here?’ they demanded in unison.

Wen Qing smirked, ‘I’m here to accompany my husband, of course.’

Feigning exhaustion, she climbed into bed. Feng Xin, fuming, followed suit.

Guan Yu stared dumbfounded as both women lay back-to-back, leaving space between them.

Seizing the moment, Guan宇 shed his clothes and slid between them.

**Chapter 825: Ecstasy Beyond Ecstasy**

The night unfolded with passionate entanglements, culminating in a steamy ménage à trois. Come morning, an exhausted but satisfied Guan宇 answered persistent knocking.

Mo Ling stood outside, smirking. ‘Lazy pig! Lunch is ready. Though...’ she leaned in conspiratorially, ‘try not to overexert yourself. Even young men need rest!’

**Chapter 826: Gao Wei Awakens**

Post-lunch, discussions turned practical. Liu Shilei mentioned the upcoming centennial celebration. Guan宇 declined attending: ‘I need to check on Gao Wei. She’s still unconscious.’

As others departed for school preparations, the villa quieted, leaving Guan宇 with Wen Qing and Feng Xin—a charged dynamic lingering from last night’s escapades.

‘Sleep well, darling?’ Wen Qing teased, glancing at Feng Xin.

Guan宇 grinned roguishly. ‘Tonight’s encore?’

‘Fine by me,’ Wen Qing purred. ‘Unless someone’s too shy...’

The air crackled with unspoken challenges and promises.
