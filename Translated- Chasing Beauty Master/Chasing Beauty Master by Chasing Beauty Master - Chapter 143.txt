Sitting in the car, Gao Wei softly comforted Guan Yu: “It’ll be alright. I’ve already notified the company. They’ll send people to explain and handle this matter. They’ll arrange the best lawyers for both of you.”

Guan Yu curled his lips faintly, smiling silently. He didn’t take Gao Wei’s words as a lifeline. Expecting her company to protect him? They had no relationship whatsoever—why would they exhaust themselves to rescue him and Niu Le? When disaster strikes, who would bother with such trivialities?

While driving, Guan Yu called Li Yuanshan. After briefly explaining the situation, he said solemnly: “Old brother, this situation might be serious. I’m heading to the police station now. If you can’t reach me, I’m entrusting this matter to you. Don’t worry about money—once I’m out, I’ll find a way…”

“Younger brother, why say such things to your elder brother? Leave it to me! I’ll book a flight immediately. Don’t worry—we have connections higher up!” Li Yuanshan readily agreed.

Guan Yu felt somewhat assured about Li Yuanshan. As the top player in China’s jewelry industry with ample assets and connections, handling this shouldn’t be problematic.

Gao Wei lowered her head, thoughts in turmoil. Guan Yu and Niu Le’s predicament was entirely her fault—she couldn’t possibly remain uninvolved! She bit her lip resolutely.

**Chapter 351: Imprisonment**

Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly while driving. After mumbling incoherently under Gao Wei’s persistent questioning, he abruptly braked and parked: “I was with Shi Lei-jie first, then fell for Xiao Juan. But after loving Xiao Juan, I found I couldn’t let go of my feelings for Shi Lei-jie… Understand?”

Gao Wei stared blankly, nodding then shaking her head: “So your conclusion? You like both girls?”

“Yes…” Guan Yu sighed solemnly against the steering wheel.

“Don’t you realize how despicable this makes you? Guan Yu, I thought you were responsible! How can you be so reckless?” Gao Wei rebuked angrily, though unsure why she felt such indignation.

Guan Yu glanced at her: “You don’t understand… No one could.” He shook his head self-mockingly.

“You might see this as promiscuity, but I can’t bear to hurt either beloved. They’re like my own flesh. I’ll take it step by step.” He gazed bleakly at passing scenery.

Gao Wei sneered, glaring: “Excuses. Even phrased beautifully, it’s still immoral.”

Guan Yu smiled bitterly, restarting the car without reply.

Regretting her harshness, Gao Wei awkwardly apologized: “Sorry… I spoke carelessly. You’re actually quite good. Xiao Juan seems devoted to you—you should treat her better.”

Guan Yu nodded calmly. He needed no instruction on cherishing his women.

At the police station, as Guan Yu and Du Xiao Juan entered the duty office, a crew-cut officer produced handcuffs before they finished explaining.

“What’s this?” Guan Yu dodged angrily.

“Surrendering suspects should behave! Homicide cases warrant handcuffs at minimum!” The officer barked. Another cop grabbed a baton, blocking the door.

Amused by their vigilance, Guan Yu extended his wrists. If he wanted to escape, these two couldn’t stop him.

As officers led him upstairs, Gao Wei covered her mouth tearfully. “I’ll save you!” she called after him.

At the stairwell turn, Guan Yu smiled calmly: “Go home. Stay safe. When I’m out, give me a hug as…”

The crew-cut cop shoved him: “Shut up! Think you’re leaving?”

Watching Guan Yu disappear in handcuffs, Gao Wei’s heart shattered. Why did this near-stranger affect her so?

In the interrogation room, Guan Yu calmly recounted events.

“Lies!” A fat detective slammed the table. “We heard you disrupted a film shoot, assaulted Piao Xu, and murdered a bodyguard with your accomplice!”

“What?” Guan Yu stood furious.

“Sit down!” The detective roared. “This isn’t your turf!”

Calming, Guan Yu shrugged: “I’ve told the truth. Verify with the crew. Release me.” He rattled his cuffs.

The officers laughed scornfully: “Murder suspects don’t walk free! Enjoy jail until trial!”

Closing his eyes, Guan Yu sneered. Clearly, Piao Xu had manipulated testimony. Let them play their games—truth would prevail.

**Chapter 352: The Enraged Crew-Cut**

Descending the corridor, Guan Yu nonchalantly reached for a cigarette. The crew-cut cop slapped it away: “Think this is your home?”

Guan Yu coldly crushed the cigarette underfoot, lighting another while staring defiantly.

“You itching for a beating?” The cop grabbed his collar.

A senior officer intervened: “Let him smoke, Liu Ji-li. He’s just a kid.”

“Fucking college brat!” Liu spat. “Act tough here—see what happens tonight!”

Passing a detention cell, Niu Le’s voice boomed: “Officer! I need to piss!”

“That bastard’s been yelling all morning!” Liu sneered. “Needs more beating!”

“Niu Le? You there?” Guan Yu called.

“Brother! These bastards want me to confess murder! You okay? They hit you?” Niu Le shouted.

“Shut up!” Liu threatened through the cell window. “I’ll electroshock your ass!”

“Fuck your mother!” Niu Le retorted.

Enraged, Liu kicked the door: “You’re dead! Just wait!”

Turning, Liu froze under Guan Yu’s murderous gaze.

“Try touching my brother,” Guan Yu hissed, “and your sister taking bus 14 from Tianqiao Road, your mother in the cafeteria, your father at Green Corp—I’ll destroy your family. Test me.”

Liu paled—how did this punk know his relatives?

“Remember your place,” Guan Yu tapped Liu’s cheek. “This uniform won’t always protect you.”
