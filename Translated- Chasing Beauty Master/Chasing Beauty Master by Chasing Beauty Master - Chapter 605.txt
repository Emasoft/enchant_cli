Chapter 1534: Breakthrough Again

Yet Guan Yu did not immediately leave the Scripture Pavilion, as disciples were normally forbidden from entering this place. They cherished this rare opportunity. Checking the time, Guan Yu saw about two double-hours remained before the session ended. Deciding to make use of the remaining moments, he took Huo Lingling on a casual stroll to explore the pavilion's mysteries.

To fulfill formalities, Huo Lingling randomly retrieved a scroll from a low-grade Yellow Tier magic box by the path – a token gesture to mark their visit. As they walked and chatted, they noticed crowds gathering wherever they went. Observing this, Guan Yu sighed and resolved to exit soon.

Just as they turned to leave, Guan Yu glimpsed a familiar figure. "Liu Chuntian?" he murmured inwardly. This daughter of Liu Yishou had once been close to him. However, after his sudden loss of cultivation power, she had distanced herself – a lingering thorn in Guan Yu's heart.

Liu Chuntian now stood before a layer of azure light waves, fiercely attacking it. Yet her strength proved insufficient; the barrier remained unmoved despite her efforts. Witnessing this, Guan Yu felt no mockery but a pang of sorrow.

Clearly, the magic box within this barrier belonged to Mysterious Tier Intermediate-Level magic. Though slightly below his requirements, it surpassed what most disciples could handle. This puzzled Guan Yu – how had Liu Chuntian detected this scroll? Normally, only cultivators reaching specific levels could sense corresponding-tier magic boxes and perceive these barriers. Yet Liu Chuntian's drenched appearance betrayed her inadequate capabilities.

"Brother Guan Yu grows more formidable by the day!" Huo Lingling chimed in with admiration.

Guan Yu merely smiled faintly. "Passable. Truthfully, it hasn't fully met my expectations. It seems I'm still lacking."

Hearing this, surrounding disciples nearly choked with exasperation. This insatiable youth had achieved what others dared not dream, yet still complained! How were they supposed to measure up?

As the violet light waves dissipated, Guan Yu saw a dark cavern entrance emitting chilly air. Testing the opening with his hand, he entered with Huo Lingling while other disciples watched from behind.

Inside the previously pitch-black cave, light suddenly illuminated a thick, dust-covered magic scroll resting at the center – clearly ancient.

"Brother Guan Yu, this scroll must have lain here for ages! Had you not come today, who knows when it might have resurfaced?"

"You overthink matters," Guan Yu chuckled noncommittally. The triennial tournament rarely produced true geniuses. Even qualified individuals would struggle to chance upon this cavern. Thus in Huntian Sect, obtaining magic scrolls depended on fate.

Blowing off dust, Guan Yu read the inscription: "Flame Wind Palm – Mysterious Tier Advanced." This brought mild satisfaction. He understood his acquisition owed much to the Sect Master's favor.

As Guan Yu lifted the scroll to leave, a hand suddenly snatched it away. Whirling around, he found Huo Lingling holding the scroll.

Examining it calmly, she said, "Brother Guan Yu, I hesitate to mention this. While others would deem this Mysterious Tier Advanced scroll a great fortune, truthfully, for your current cultivation and latent potential, practicing it brings less benefit than imagined."

Surprised, Guan Yu demanded, "Explain! Why would this treasure become worthless in your eyes?"

Seeing his expression shift, Huo Lingling flicked her wrists, producing a worn cyan scroll. Despite its appearance, Guan Yu's sharp intuition detected power surpassing Mysterious Tier Advanced.

His heart quickened. Beyond Mysterious Tier could only mean... Earth Tier magic! Any Earth Tier artifact, regardless of grade, held immense value.

Watching Guan Yu prepare for advancement, Huo Lingling felt both joy and anxiety. Breakthroughs rarely proceeded smoothly, often bringing unforeseen complications.

Striving to ensure success, she channeled golden elemental energy to envelop Guan Yu. Only by exhausting her efforts could she maximize his chances.

As celestial elements gradually infused Guan Yu's body, his condition stabilized. Under the blazing sun, Huo Lingling observed his meditative form and sighed in relief – this breakthrough would elevate Guan Yu's standing within Huntian Sect.

When dusk deepened, Guan Yu awoke groggily, rubbing his eyes. "Lingling, how long did I sleep?"

Before she could answer, he noticed anomalies. Stretching produced crackling bone noises. "Lingling! What's happening? Did I... breakthrough again?"

Amused by his bewildered look, Huo Lingling suppressed a smile. "Indeed! Never have I seen one advance through slumber. Were everyone so fortunate, masters would crowd the world!"

Chapter 1535: The Alchemy Cauldron's Role

Hearing Bikamiao emphasize the magic alchemy cauldron's importance, Guan Yu asked, "Does possessing a superior cauldron guarantee better magic elixirs?"

"Not entirely. Even with an excellent cauldron, an unskilled alchemist cannot produce quality elixirs. Refining superior magic pills requires both cauldron and alchemist to contribute equally."

This explanation gave Guan Yu fundamental understanding. As Bikamiao summoned his cauldron, magical herbs flew into it with a radiant glow.

When the herbs entered, Bikamiao waved his dragon claw. A lid-like object materialized above the floating cauldron, descending to seal it. The feline then spat out a tiny orb crackling with lightning.

The orb's appearance dramatically raised ambient temperature. Nearby plants rapidly desiccated, astonishing Guan Yu. Ignoring his shock, Bikamiao guided the orb beneath the cauldron.

Upon reaching its destination, the orb transformed into azure flames wreathed in lightning. The black cauldron gradually turned gray. "Bikamiao! What's this? It looks eerie!" Guan Yu exclaimed.

"Fool! No flame, no elixirs. This is my Thunderfire – lightning-forged alchemical flames! What you witnessed was mere spark compared to true Thunderfire. Had I unleashed genuine flames, not just this mountain but all Qingyang Town would've turned to ash!"

Guan Yu shuddered, recalling how the sparks alone withered vegetation. Suddenly, an exotic fragrance revitalized his spirits. Tracing the scent, he found it emanating from the cauldron.

As the Thunderfire vanished, Bikamiao barked, "Stop gawking! Fetch vials for the elixir!"

Snapping to attention, Guan Yu caught a thrown vial adorned with dark patterns emitting magical vibrations. "Don't bother peering inside," Bikamiao said. "This spatial vial's interior dwarfs its exterior – a dimensional container."

When the last drop flowed in, Bikamiao retrieved his cauldron. "Now find more vials. We'll auction these in town, then purchase my listed herbs."

Chapter 1536: Vanishing Elixir

Noticing the lidless vial, Guan Yu asked, "Won't the contents spill?"

"Try emptying it," Bikamiao teased. Shaking the inverted vial vigorously yielded nothing. Guan Yu realized the dark patterns' magic prevented leakage. "These markings resemble a sealing array!"

"Perceptive! The 'Qiankun Lock' array traps occupants until the caster eliminates them," Bikamiao confirmed.

Eager to learn, Guan Yu's hopeful gaze met Bikamiao's dismissal: "Forget it! At your level, attempting this array would destroy you!"

"Can't I aspire?" Guan Yu retorted.

"Enough! Fetch vials. After auctioning these at Divine Wind Auction House, buy my herbs." Divine Wind, the Moon Empire's premier auction chain founded by Grand Alchemist Kaxier, dominated commerce.

Navigating bustling streets, Guan Yu ducked into an alley at Bikamiao's urging. "Why here?" he questioned, awaiting instructions.
