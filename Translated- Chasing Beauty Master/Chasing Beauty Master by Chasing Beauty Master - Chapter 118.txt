“Ahem... Well, if you’re short on money, I can give you some. Making profits requires long-term planning, understand?” Guan Yu said with a restrained smile. This little girl thought reading a few books made her understand market trends and business? How naive. Unless... she planned to exploit her grandfather’s connections for shady deals. But at his advanced age, the old man surely cared little for wealth.

Seeing Guan Yu’s dismissive expression, Zhao Jing’er pouted and huffed, “Brother, you don’t trust me? I guarantee I’ll turn your two million into three within a week!”

Guan Yu grimaced, coughing awkwardly. If making money were so easy, why would there still be so many struggling workers?

Even Du Xiaojuan, the simple-minded girl, covered her mouth to suppress giggles. No one believed a sheltered girl could be a financial genius.

After lunch, Guan Yu took Zhao Jing’er to a electronics mall. She chose an 8,000-yuan laptop before they returned home.

Back in her room, Zhao Jing’er connected to Wi-Fi and buried herself in research, skipping proper meals as she hunched over her laptop.

“Rest early. School starts tomorrow,” Guan Yu said softly, ruffling her hair as he sat beside her.

“Mhm, got it!” She turned with a sweet smile.

Noticing her screen, Guan Yu frowned. “You’re... stock trading?”

“Yes...” She nodded absently.

Guan Yu nearly laughed. Stock markets were complex labyrinths where few prospered. This naive girl thought she could strike gold? Preposterous.

Yet he refrained from mockery, simply watching with amusement.

“Brother... would you really invest a few million for me to manage?” she asked earnestly.

Guan Yu sighed. “What’s in that little head of yours? You think this is some money tree?”

Seeing her stubborn pout, he relented. “Fine. One million. When it’s gone, no more fantasies.”

A million meant little to him now. Besides, she might not lose it all.

“Perfect! We’ll handle bank transfers tomorrow! One million—promise!” She clapped excitedly.

Years of secretly analyzing indices in her grandfather’s study had convinced her of her skills. With Guan Yu’s capital, she’d finally prove herself!

**Chapter 288: Enrollment and Registration**

As Zhao Jing’er typed, Guan Yu leaned against her, his hand slipping under her shirt to caress her soft chest.

After nudging her bra aside, his palm settled possessively.

Blushing fiercely, Zhao Jing’er stole glances while pretending to focus on her screen, though his electric touch shattered her concentration.

The “treatment” lasted mere seconds before he readjusted her bra and withdrew his arm.

“Sleep well, little sister,” he said, tweaking her nose.

“Oh, take a hot bath tonight. Improves circulation. Your body’s still too cold.”

Alone, Zhao Jing’er stared at her chest, biting her lip as conflicting emotions swirled.

**Chapter 289: Zhao Jing’er’s Charisma**

The next morning, Feng Xin drove the trio to campus.

“I’ll fetch you at noon,” she said before speeding off, ignoring Guan Yu’s safety reminders.

The former gang leader turned chauffeur—Guan Yu chuckled at the irony.

After parting with Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu led Zhao Jing’er toward administration—only to freeze at the crowd awaiting them: principals, directors, even the city’s education bureau chief.

“Reporting... for enrollment?” Guan Yu stated awkwardly.

The bald bureau chief practically bowed. “Miss Zhao! Everything’s arranged! Any needs—tell the principal directly!”

Overwhelmed by the sycophantic welcome, Zhao Jing’er clung to Guan Yu until he rescued her: “We’ll head to class now.”

The principal watched them leave anxiously. This Guan Yu who’d challenged the mighty Jin family... would he bring more chaos than Jin Cheng?

**Chapter 290: May I Sit Here?**

Zhao Jing’er’s only request was joining Guan Yu’s class—easily granted.

As Guan Yu reentered the classroom, whispers erupted. His clash with Jin Cheng had made him legendary.

“Yu-ge! Over here!” Tian Hao waved eagerly. Recent events had elevated him and Wang Zhen to campus celebrities.

Guan Yu dismissed their schemes for recruiting underclassmen. “Handle it yourselves. No interest in campus gangs.”

While discussing the cowed Jin faction, Wang Zhen sneered at the cornered Fu Lili. “That shrew’s been quiet lately. Deal with her?”

“Ignore her if she stays tame,” Guan Yu said, though inwardly calculating risks. Without solid backing, provoking powerful families was dangerous.

The door swung open.

“Holy... angel!” Wang Zhen gaped as Liu Shilei entered with Zhao Jing’er.

The classroom stilled. This ethereal beauty—pale, delicate, radiating otherworldly grace—made even the female teacher Liu Shilei feel maternal.

Zhao Jing’er’s gaze swept the room before settling on Guan Yu. Softly, she asked:

“May I sit with you?”
