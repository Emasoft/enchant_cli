The Watanabe Society's influence in the Eastern Islands was formidable, to the extent that even the police department dared not provoke them lightly. It was said that the Watanabe members grew so brazen after nightfall that they would expel officers from their territory, declaring: "Daytime belongs to you police, but night belongs to the Watanabe Society. Should you dare step into our domain, we'll teach you the meaning of ultimate fear."

Yet what followed left Sakurako witnessing the unimaginable. A power repair vehicle parked by the roadside suddenly roared to life like a maddened bull, charging toward three young delinquents. Astonishingly, the trio appeared equally frenzied - instead of evading the oncoming truck, they accelerated toward its grille. Three dull thuds echoed like watermelons smashing against pavement as their skulls shattered upon impact, brains spattering across the asphalt.

The crowd surged forward like tidal waves, murmuring about the uncanny incident. While the truck's sudden movement could be attributed to mechanical failure, the delinquents' suicidal charge defied reason. As Sakurako holstered her pistol to investigate, Guan Yu gently grasped her wrist. "This is a traffic accident under jurisdiction of road police. As an officer, shouldn't you refrain from overstepping?"

His calm demeanor tempered Sakurako's impulse. Recognizing the crowd's presence and the accident's apparent nature, she nodded. "I'll check for casualties."

Internally, Guan Yu tensed. Having subtly influenced Sakurako's consciousness through spiritual energy, he expected compliance. Her residual autonomy to verify the delinquents' condition revealed unexpected mental resilience.

"Wouldn't you rather fulfill hostess duties by treating me to dinner?" Guan Yu smiled. "Their shattered skulls would ruin anyone's appetite. Best we avoid the spectacle."

Imagining the gory scene, Sakurako palmed. "You're right. Let me take you to our finest sushi establishment."

Earlier, the delinquents' anti-Chinese slurs had kindled Guan Yu's lethal intent. Constrained by public scrutiny, he'd manipulated both their consciousness and the truck driver remotely. This covert elimination ensured his Eastern Islands agenda remained uncompromised.

Though not one for patriotic proclamations, Guan Yu held his homeland and kin as sacrosanct. Any transgression against these received merciless retribution.

Having spent mere hours in the Eastern Islands, Guan Yu sensed mounting hostility - an ominous undercurrent he aimed to quell.

Sakurako navigated through Huko City's aging districts until reaching a railway-adjacent building. Descending to a basement, they arrived at Sukiyabashi Jiro - the revered sushi sanctuary she'd praised.

Even Guan Yu's untrained eye recognized Sakurako's extraordinary status. The ten-seat counter, requiring three-month reservations, parted effortlessly before them. The octogenarian chef simply gestured them to seats.

While appreciating the culinary artistry, Guan Yu found little taste for Eastern Islands cuisine, mirroring his disdain for certain locals. Yet he mimicked Sakurako's relish to avoid offense.

Mid-meal, wooden doors crashed open. Katana-wielding brutes stormed in, clearing other patrons before leveling blades at the pair.

Twelve glinting swords pointed menacingly, yet the elderly chef continued shaping rice with undivided focus. Unperturbed, Sakurako murmured between bites: "Guan, honor Chef Ono's craft. Savor each morsel."

Guan Yu's eyelids twitched - from the wizened chef emanated formidable energy. Despite their bluster, the intruders froze, intimidated into silence until Ono completed his current piece.

Placing the finished sushi with ritual care, Ono cleansed his hands before addressing the leader. "Watanabe Society?"

Though disinterested in the cuisine, Guan Yu consumed his meal respectfully. He noted the gang members' palpable fear toward Chef Ono - clearly, this sushi master concealed martial prowess.

The leader bowed deeply. "Apologies, Master Ono. These two killed three of ours. We must take them, regrettably disrupting your business."

Ono nodded. "In my establishment, guests are sacred. Resolve matters beyond my hundred-meter perimeter." His frail frame radiate authority.

When underlings protested, Ono's blade flashed - an ear thudded floor. The chastened group retreated hastily.

As Ono resumed work, Guan Yu detected qi reminiscent of Chinese cultivators. Sakurako, unsurprised by events, kept eating. Post-meal, she patted her stomach. "Master Ono, you ruin my diet every time! Thank you."

Both exited without payment. Bowing, Guan Yu complimented: "Exquisite sushi."

Ono smiled. "Mr. Guan, no need feign enjoyment. Many Chinese dislike our flavors."

Guan Yu stiffened - the old man had discerned his true identity. Sakurako remained oblivious to the name correction.

"I once wandered China," Ono reminisced. "Studied under an immortal-like master, though my aptitude limited me to basics. He claimed true power lay beyond his grasp. Tonight, I witness that power incarnate."

Guan Yu's mind raced - this unknown Chinese sage predated his knowledge. Dragon Group's records needed updating.

Acknowledging exposure, Guan Yu stood. "You flatter me."

Ono shook his head. "Eastern Islands and China share close waters. I implore mercy where possible."

"Evil begets evil," Guan Yu countered. "Our world faces impending catastrophe requiring united fronts. We won't foolishly weaken ourselves."

The chef aged visibly, bowing deeply. "Your righteousness humbles me."

Exiting, Guan Yu marveled to Sakurako: "Who'd imagine this humble chef ranks among your top three swordsmen?"

"My own mentor!" Sakurako beamed, drawing a flexible blade. "Stay back - I'll handle them."

Guan Yu's spiritual sense detected three elite mutants in a nearby car. As he feigned nonchalance, inside the restaurant Ono murmured: "Kindred spirits across seas remain but dreams..." before stilling.

Outside, Watanabe members charged. Sakurako's blade danced - twelve katanas met twelve severed limbs. Her footwork blended Eastern swordsmanship with Chinese martial arts, drawing Guan Yu's admiration.

Watching Sakurako advance, Guan Yu contemplated: "Some bond for lifetimes yet remain strangers; others connect at first glance." Her initial hostility had paradoxically revealed kinship.

As heiress to a zaibatsu, Sakurako feared no yakuza. The Watanabe grunts knew only their targets' descriptions, unaware of Sakurako's blade or Guan Yu's aura chilling their veins.

The leader roared charge. At three meters, Sakurako exploded forward like mist, blade singing. Simultaneously, a mutant smoke-phased from the car.

Guan Yu moved - restrained to conventional martial display. The mutant arrived late; twelve men lay maimed, howling amidst spreading bloodstench.
