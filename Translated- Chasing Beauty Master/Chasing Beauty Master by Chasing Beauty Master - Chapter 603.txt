Dozens of spiritual energy currents converged from all directions, encircling the wisp of lightning element. The fleeing electric strand accelerated its escape, provoking Guan Yu's frustration. Gritting his teeth, he pushed his spiritual energy manipulation to its limits. As his pursuing forces closed in, relief washed over him.

Yet sweat cascaded down Guan Yu's drenched back. Never before had he channeled such vast spiritual reserves while enduring the searing agony radiating from his Dantian. Exhaustion threatened to overwhelm him.

"This won't do," he muttered through clenched teeth. "If I don't act soon, I'll collapse. Wait—that technique might work!"

A sudden epiphany illuminated his features. The chasing spiritual currents halted abruptly, retreating instead of advancing. Sensing reprieve, the lightning element paused—only to find itself engulfed by a colossal vortex materializing around it.

Chapter 1529: The Vortex

A titanic suction force erupted from the swirling maelstrom. The lightning element froze in bewildered hesitation—a fatal delay. By the time it attempted escape, the vortex's gravitational pull had already ensnared it. "Run now?" Guan Yu snarled, veins bulging as he poured every ounce of strength into maintaining the vortex. "Too late!"

The spiraling forces intensified exponentially. With a final desperate struggle, the lightning strand vanished into the vortex's heart. Guan Yu's triumphant roar echoed through the chamber: "Thought you could escape me?!"

Maintaining the vortex's rotation, he forced the captured element into dizzying spirals. His strategy crystallized—using the rotating Qi Sea within his Dantian to imprison the rebellious energy. Against expectations, the lightning element's momentary confusion allowed swift victory.

Hours later, observing the pacified energy slowly orbiting his Dantian, Guan Yu collapsed onto his bed as bone-deep fatigue claimed him.

Dawn's golden fingers crept through his window, illuminating a disheveled youth reeking of burnt ozone. Sunlight roused Guan Yu, whose refreshed eyes sparkled with newfound vigor. Wrinkling his nose at his stench, he bolted outside to wash.

Returning cleansed, he nearly collided with his father Guan Xiao at the courtyard entrance. "Father! Weren't you meant to be away?"

"The clan summoned me," Guan Xiao replied, stroking his beard. "Preparations for the Three-Moon Youth Tournament begin. They require my presence."

Curiosity ignited in Guan Yu's eyes. "Might I attend this year?"

His father's eyebrows arched. "Since when does my bookish son care for martial contests?"

"Times change," Guan Yu grinned. "I've grown stronger."

Guan Xiao chuckled. "Stronger? Boy, the tournament features prodigies like Wang Tianlong—nearly a Second Stage Warrior. You're merely Qi Refining Second Layer."

Unfazed, Guan Yu retorted, "Second Stage Warriors aren't my ceiling. I'll surpass even you!" Darting away, he left his father's laughter trailing behind.

Chapter 1530: Assistance

At his mountain training ground, Guan Yu meditated until a familiar voice interrupted. "No pressure, eh?" Bikamiao the Saint Dragon materialized, whiskers twitching with amusement.

"Would you prefer I cower?" Guan Yu shot back.

"Cheeky fledgling!" Thunder cracked as a bolt struck Guan Yu, charring him black. "But credit where due—you've stabilized your first lightning strand overnight."

While Guan Yu picked soot from his hair, Bikamiao explained, "My Mystic Thunder enhances both magic resistance and elemental affinity. Try absorbing another strand."

The difference proved astonishing. Guan Yu seamlessly drew a second lightning wisp into his Dantian. "Does this resistance apply to other elements?" he inquired post-training.

"Lightning reigns supreme among six elements," Bikamiao lectured. "Master it, and others become easier. Few humans achieve this—you're now among rare company."

Chapter 1531: Dragonkin Revisited

"Besides dragonkind, only Thunder Sprites wield lightning," Bikamiao continued. "As for tomorrow's training..." A sinister grin spread. "...we'll double the Mystic Thunder's intensity."

Guan Yu's triumphant smile froze.

Next dawn found him weathering amplified thunderbolts atop mist-shrouded peaks. Bikamiao observed contentedly as Guan Yu endured, collapsing only when his skin began cracking. "Enough for today," the dragon conceded. "Absorb another strand while your affinity peaks."

Though battered, Guan Yu's determination burned brighter than the arcing lightning around him.
