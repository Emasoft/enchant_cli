Initially, Young Master Men appeared as a refined gentleman of noble status, handsome appearance, and wealthy background. Yet through prolonged interactions, people gradually discovered he was merely a wolf in sheep's clothing.

All eyes nervously watched Guan Yu's expression. Young Master Men fidgeted uneasily, uncertain what action the imposing figure might take next.

Waving his hand dismissively, Guan Yu remarked, "Let it be. We shouldn't force what cannot be. Though given your tender years, even if you've mastered several instruments, it's likely mere entertainment. I doubt you could perform any truly exquisite melodies."

"Young Master speaks true," Cuihua replied without pretense. "The few instruments I learned serve only to please guests. As for skill level, I remain most rudimentary." She accepted Guan Yu's barbed comment with grace.

"Excellent! I appreciate your candor. Come drink with me then. The ambiance here at Echoing Jade Pavilion proves rather agreeable." Guan Yu smiled, beckoning Cuihua to pour wine.

Seeing Guan Yu's improved mood, Young Master Men relaxed slightly. Yet lingering doubts about Guan Yu's identity persisted - why would a high-ranking official suddenly appear in Qujiang City? Could this be some minister's scion?

"Young Master bears the Guan surname? Forgive my dull eyes - might I inquire which esteemed Guan family claims your lineage? I should pay proper respects at your residence when convenient." Young Master Men probed cautiously.

Ignoring the question, Guan Yu sipped his wine approvingly. "Ah, excellent vintage! Paired with beauty-poured libations, truly sublime. How fortunate I am today - making Young Master Men's acquaintance while discovering such remarkable company in this humble establishment."

**Chapter 3425: Stand and Speak**

Guan Yu nodded with feigned understanding as Young Master Men vented: "Brother Guan knows we come here for amusement. These tavern wenches act above their station despite their lowly status! When I offered gold for her compliance, this pretentious strumpet refused - as if commoners could catch my eye!"

"Your words hold truth," Guan Yu conceded. "Yet aspirations differ. The madam mentioned various tiers of entertainers here. Perhaps you should... diversify your pursuits?"

"I only pursued Cuihua for her youthful charm. Dozens throw themselves at my door daily - why bother with these trulls?"

Guan Yu believed the claim. As the city magistrate's second son, countless matchmakers swarmed Young Master Men's threshold. Such privilege bred arrogance.

"Ah, seems either insufficient effort or specific objections from Miss Cuihua." Guan Yu produced a heavy money pouch. "Since you fancy her, let me assist. Observe how golden persuasion works."

He thrust the bulging gold sack at Cuihua. The girl paled, prostrating herself. "Young Master! How have I erred? Punish this lowly one!"

"Why fear? This gold is yours to accept Young Master Men's suit. Though refusal remains your right." Guan Yu's smile held dangerous charm.

Young Master Men's eyes gleamed at the bounty. Two benefits beckoned - claiming the beauty while anticipating kickbacks from her windfall. His gaze towards Guan Yu turned worshipful.

"Rise when speaking," Guan Yu commanded.

Trembling, Cuihua stood head bowed. The life-changing sum tempted powerfully - enough to purchase Echoing Jade Pavilion itself! Yet as an orphan raised by madam Xiliu, she'd never contemplated selling virtue for wealth.

Torn between lifelong security and self-respect, Cuihua wavered. Serving the decent-seeming Guan Yu might be tolerable, but submitting to the odious Young Master Men repelled her.

"Forgive me, Young Master. My duties encompass music and companionship only."

"Brainless wench!" Young Master Men exploded. "Refusing this fortune? I'd bed swine for such gold!"

"Excellent! Shall I fund your porcine tryst?" Guan Yu slid the pouch towards him.

Young Master Men blanched. "Mere... hyperbole, Brother Guan!"

"Jests require care. Since Miss Cuihua declines, we must respect it. Gold solves many problems, but not all." Guan Yu retrieved his purse, handing Cuihua a gold leaf instead. "A meeting gift. Accept it."

"Take what our master gives!" bodyguard Xiao Zhi barked.

Cuihua kowtowed, receiving the leaf. "This lowly one thanks Young Master's generosity."

Guan Yu chuckled at her kneeling in thin yellow skirts. "No need for ceremony. My gifts require only acceptance."

**Chapter 3426: Prodigal**

Madam Xiliu arrived, bowing deeply. "Echoing Jade Pavilion thanks Young Master's unprecedented largesse."

Young Master Men burned with humiliation as Guan Yu declared, "This gold leaf secures Miss Cuihua's exclusive service. Institute a membership system - regular patrons earn discounts."

The shrewd madam grasped the concept instantly. "Your wisdom enlightens us, Young Master."

"Another condition." Guan Yu pointed at Cuihua. "She attends no others. Cite my prohibition if requested."

Xiliu glanced nervously at Young Master Men, whose forced smile conceded defeat. "Naturally, Brother Guan's pleasure comes first."

"Should more gold be needed..." Guan Yu began.

"Sufficient! Cuihua is yours alone," Xiliu vowed. The madam's mind raced - this profligate could elevate Cuihua to concubine status, solving all problems.

**Chapter 3427: Lavish Feast**

Departing, Xiao Zhi muttered, "Squandering Master Lu's gold on a tavern wench! He'll skin you alive!"

"Necessary performance," Guan Yu retorted. "Only overwhelming wealth could deter that lecher permanently."

"Admit you fancied her!"

"Must I rescue only paramours?" Guan Yu kicked at his companion. "Though were I interested, what of it? We're both unattached."

Bodyguard A'ze chuckled, "Xiao Zhi fears you'll steal Miss Siqi's affections."

"Precisely! With you occupied elsewhere..."

Guan Yu laughed heartily. "Even then, Siqi would choose me! Chew on that bitterness!"

Their raucous banter echoed through Qujiang's streets, the gold-spattered performance having achieved its purpose - a vulnerable girl protected through calculated extravagance.
