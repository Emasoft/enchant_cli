Wang Jun glanced curiously at Guan Yu, immediately understanding his intent. He nodded, stood up, and exited the room. The maid who overheard Guan Yu's words guided Wang Jun out.

Guan Yu had wanted Wang Jun to survey their surroundings and detect anything unusual for future reference. Fortunately, Wang Jun grasped his meaning instantly. Guan Yu felt relieved—bringing someone with worldly experience like Wang Jun had been the right decision.

Unbeknownst to them, Old Master Li had been observing from a shadowed corner. Now alone with Guan Yu, he scrutinized the young man's reactions. Every item in the room—the furniture, decor, even the calligraphy and paintings adorning the walls—exuded opulence. Had Guan Yu shown the slightest greed or suspicious behavior, Old Master Li would have exposed him as an imposter.

So far, however, the noble composure both guests displayed amidst such wealth impressed him. Their refined manners and indifference to luxury convinced him they were genuine aristocrats. Moments later, Wang Jun returned from his brief absence.

Emerging at last, Old Master Li strode forward with a genial smile. “Ah, honored guests! Forgive this old man’s tardy welcome. Please, sit!”

Guan Yu observed the spry man in his fifties. Though aged, Old Master Li carried himself with the authority of one accustomed to command—back straight, steps brisk, robes resplendent, gold hairpin gleaming. This could only be the master of the house.

Rising politely, Guan Yu clasped his hands in greeting. As the younger party, deference was expected. “Greetings, Old Master Li. We apologize for intruding unannounced.”

“No need for formalities! The Li family always welcomes distinguished travelers.” The old man gestured magnanimously, settling into the host’s seat with impeccable posture. “Let us discuss your purpose over tea.”

A maid entered bearing an exquisite red jade teapot and cups—another display of extravagant wealth. Guan Yu noted their value but betrayed no reaction. The Li family’s riches were none of his concern, though he sensed Old Master Li’s sharp eyes assessing him beneath the affable facade.

After sipping his tea, Old Master Li inquired, “Might I ask your origins and destination?”

Wang Jun remained silent, leaving Guan Yu to respond. “We hail from Qujiang City. I am Young Master Luo, traveling to Zhouji City for materials. Alas, our carriage broke down en route. Hearing of your household’s renowned prosperity, we hoped to purchase a replacement.”

Internally, Guan Yu fretted. The Luo family’s fame could be a double-edged sword. If Old Master Li recognized inconsistencies in his story…

“Ah, the Luo family!” The old man’s eyes crinkled. “I met your father years ago—you were but a child then. How time flies!”

Guan Yu’s relief was short-lived. This man had indeed encountered the real Luo patriarch. Fortunately, years had blurred the details. “I recall Father mentioning a ‘Uncle Li.’ Your distinguished bearing must have left an impression.”

Wang Jun tensed, fearing exposure, but Guan Yu smoothly covered: “My attendant suffers from travel fatigue and stomach troubles. Pay him no mind.”

When Old Master Li offered medical aid, Wang Jun seized the chance to exit, pretending another bout of illness. Alone now, Guan Yu navigated the verbal chess match.

“Qujiang abounds in resources,” pressed Old Master Li. “Why seek materials elsewhere?”

“A private invention,” Guan Yu deflected. “I require sturdy beast sinews and mystic steel—specialties of Zhouji City.”

The old man’s gaze sharpened. “We may have sinews in our storeroom. Stay for lunch, and I’ll have the steward show you.”

Guan Yu declined politely, pressing for immediate carriage arrangements. Beneath the courteous exchange, both men weighed hidden agendas—Old Master Li seeking favor with the powerful Luo family, Guan Yu maintaining his fragile deception.

Meanwhile, Wang Jun explored the compound, noting the eerie quiet. Few servants stirred despite the daylight. The ostentatious estate in this remote town raised suspicions—wealth here meant power unchecked, secrets easily buried.

Finding nothing amiss, Wang Jong reluctantly played his role, muttering curses at Guan Yu’s “stomach ailment” ruse. His absence, however, served its purpose—removing an unpredictable element from the delicate negotiations.

As Guan Yu parried probing questions about Qujiang’s commerce, he sensed Old Master Li’s growing conviction in his identity. The promised carriage became inevitable—a small price for the Li family to curry favor with the Luo heir.

Yet time pressed. Guan Yu insisted on departing posthaste, citing his attendant’s health. Old Master Li relented, promising prime horses and vehicles. The dance of courtesy continued, each move calculated, every smile veiling unspoken calculations.

Outside, autumn leaves swirled where Wang Jun paced, unaware their success hinged on Guan Yu’s silver tongue and the fragile house of cards it sustained.
