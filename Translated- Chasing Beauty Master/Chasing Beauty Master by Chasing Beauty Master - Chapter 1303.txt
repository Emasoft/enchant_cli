From the very beginning, Guanyu had repeatedly exercised restraint, but this Wang Xiaorong truly went too far. If the other party continued like this, Guanyu had no intention of saving face for her any longer.

"Xiaorong, are you staying here alone?" Guanyu asked kindly.

"Exactly. Since I'm alone, I get terribly frightened at night," Wang Xiaorong replied, putting on a pitiful expression.

"If you're truly alone, why insist on Room Six instead of choosing any ordinary room?" Guanyu inquired calmly.

"Because you reserved Rooms Five, Six, and Seven. Didn't you just say several men would be staying in Five and Seven? By occupying Six, I'll be much safer. Any disturbance would bring you rushing to my aid immediately."

The girl's cunning left Guanyu speechless. With her reasoning laid bare, he could only concede: "Very well. We'll take other rooms. I trust nothing will happen. Moreover, you all have your own capabilities. No major issues should arise."

Though Guanyu remained composed, Wang Xiaorong found his restraint unsatisfying. She considered provoking him further but decided against it, realizing true anger might force her hand.

After dinner, as the group ascended to their rooms, Wang Xiaorong bounced over to Room Six. Siqi and the others reluctantly took opposite Room Three. By the time Guanyu's party arrived, the entire second floor had been occupied.

Standing at her doorway, Wang Xiaorong smiled coquettishly at Guanyu. "Such a long night ahead. Can you really sleep? Why not chat awhile? I do enjoy conversing with you."

Guanyu shook his head. "My apologies. The day's journey has wearied me, and tomorrow brings more travel. I must retire."

Xiao Zhi marveled at Guanyu's refusal of such a charming invitation. Though Wang Xiaorong's temper left much to be desired, rejecting a beauty's request seemed almost sacrilegious.

"Xiaorong, if Guanyu's tired, I'm wide awake! Shall I keep you company?" Xiao Zhi offered with a grin.

"You?" Wang Xiaorong shot him a withering look. "Don't flatter yourself. I've no interest in your chatter." With that, she slammed her door shut.

At dawn, Siqi and Xiaotong rose early to prepare for the journey to Qujiang City. Over breakfast, Xiao Zhi mounted his horse and asked, "Guanyu, did that Wang Xiaorong bother you again last night?"

"What trouble could she cause? Her ire never seemed directed at me."

Xiao Zhi chuckled. "When she asked to chat last night, you actually refused? Didn't seek her out afterward?"

"Of course not. I returned to my room and slept straight through till morning."

Xiao Zhi sighed with mixed emotions. "What a waste. Such a beauty, utterly wasted."

"Enough," Guanyu retorted. "She's just a girl. How could I entertain such thoughts?"

As Xiao Zhi opened his mouth to respond, Guanyu cut him off: "No more on this. Let's make haste."

By afternoon, Qujiang City's gates loomed ahead. Aze sighed: "What a journey! Finally here. Shouldn't we eat first?"

"Agreed," Guanyu said. "We'll find a restaurant upon entering." The uneventful journey had been surprisingly smooth.

Guanyu inquired: "Aren't we staying at Xiao Zhi's uncle's residence? Shouldn't we proceed directly? Surely he'll accommodate us well."

"Not possible," Xiao Zhi replied. "My uncle lives north of the city – still some distance. We'll lodge here tonight and depart early tomorrow. I'll send word ahead."

Nodding, Guanyu suggested: "Let's find an inn then."

They chose an establishment near the city gates. Qujiang's prosperity manifested in bustling streets lined with merchants and performers showcasing skills for coins. Well-wishers rewarded impressive acts with silver.

That evening, Guanyu announced: "Rest well tonight. We depart at dawn."

"Must we rise early?" Xiao Zhi grimaced. "The remaining distance isn't great. Let's sleep properly."

Considering this, Guanyu conceded: "Very well. We'll depart when you wake naturally."

Xiao Zhi brightened. "Excellent! Aze, let's explore the night markets. Far livelier than Luyu Town!"

Securing three adjacent rooms, Guanyu found himself oddly missing Wang Xiaorong's antics. As he meditated that night, attuning his inner energy, a sudden crash interrupted his cultivation – likely his companions' horseplay, he reasoned.

"Xiaotong! Are you there?" Siqi's urgent voice shattered the stillness.

Guanyu emerged to find Siqi distraught. "I stepped out briefly. When I returned, the door was smashed and Xiaotong gone!"

Investigating their room, Guanyu noted the inward-smashed door and strange black hairs beneath a stool – coarse strands resembling those of the Black-Furred Monster from Cloudgreen Sect.

"What happened here?" Xiao Zhi and Aze rushed in.

"Xiaotong's been taken. We must act quickly." Guanyu displayed the hairs.

"Animal fur?" Xiao Zhi wondered.

Aze's eyes widened. "The Black-Furred Monster followed us? Took Xiaotong?"

"Likely. We must split up to search," Guanyu urged.

Siqi objected: "Not alone. Pairs for safety."

Agreeing, they divided teams. The bustling streets offered little clue until Guanyu noticed a dilapidated building bearing a "Gambling Den" sign.

Inside the smoke-filled den, Wang Xiaorong materialized, slapping Guanyu's shoulder. "Fancy meeting a fellow gambler! Come play dice!"

Guanyu showed her the hairs. "Xiaotong's been taken. Do you recognize these?"

Wang Xiaorong's expression darkened. "You crossed them? Fools! Their methods are brutal. With just two of you, rescue's impossible. Fetch reinforcements."

"Only Xiaotong was taken. Tell us where to find them!"

"That shrew?" Wang Xiaorong sneered. "Why should I care?"

"This is life and death! Must you be so childish?" Siqi snapped.

"Childish?" Wang Xiaorong whirled on Guanyu. "Remember this – without me, your friend dies unknown!" She stormed off.

Swallowing pride, Guanyu pursued her. "My words were harsh. Please, help us."

Smirking, Wang Xiaorong conceded: "For your sake then. But you owe me a favor."

"Name it, within reason."

"Undecided. But first..." Her eyes gleamed. "Gather your fools. That place requires numbers."

At dawn, the regrouped party followed Wang Xiaorong through winding alleys. "The Black Claw Gang operates here," she warned. "They traffic in dark arts. Those hairs belong to their beast-tamers' hybrids."

The abandoned temple loomed ahead, its crumbling arches veiled in mist. Strange growls echoed within. Wang Xiaorong drew twin daggers. "Ready yourselves. Once inside, there's no retreating."

Guanyu nodded, hand resting on sword hilt. The real trial was about to begin.
