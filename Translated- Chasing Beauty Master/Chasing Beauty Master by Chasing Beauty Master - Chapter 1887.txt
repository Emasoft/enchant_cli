However, at the Grand Prince's residence, Yu Kong understood this was an assignment devoid of any personal gain. The Grand Prince wouldn't offer him silver coins, for everyone knew of his frugal nature and meager stipend – evidenced by the shabby, timeworn state of his manor.

Yet Yu Kong remained steadfastly loyal to Consort Guifen and thoroughly acquainted with the Grand Prince's circumstances. Though he wouldn't presume to offer unsolicited advice, he acknowledged the prince's basic courtesy in at least inviting him inside for tea.

**Chapter 4959: Courting Favor**

After one sip, Yu Kong nearly spat out the brew. Swallowing with forced politeness, he finally blurted, "Your Highness, forgive my bluntness – but as imperial royalty, how can you drink such swill? Even common teahouses serve better leaves than this!"

The Grand Prince smiled ruefully. "My apologies, Chief Steward. I seldom drink tea, hence the poor quality. I'm ashamed to have embarrassed myself before you."

"This simply won't do!" Yu Kong pressed. "We share common cause, Your Highness. As royalty second only to the Emperor, your household's state... well, I'll refrain from commentary. But though your stipend is modest, shouldn't you at least maintain basic appearances? By heavens – this tea tastes like death brewed from years-old dust!"

"You shame me with your honesty," the prince acknowledged. "I shall reconsider my ways."

"Precisely! Given our connection, never hesitate to seek my assistance." Yu Kong leaned closer. "Regarding His Majesty assigning you this prime investigation – you should thank the Grand Princess. Without her counsel, this opportunity would never have come your way."

"The Grand Princess advocated for me?" The prince's eyebrows rose. "But she shows favor to none. Could this stem from my saving Jiangxin County Princess?"

"Her motives elude even me," Yu Kong admitted. "During the imperial council with Minister Qi present, she suddenly proposed your name – suggesting the inquiry required someone completely impartial. This not only aided you but implicitly implicated Second Prince's faction."

Understanding dawned. "By framing me as an outsider, she implies Second Prince's connection to the case. Clever. I must express gratitude."

"Without question," Yu Kong nodded. "Though she abstains from court affairs, her influence rivals Second Prince's. Cultivating her favor could prove invaluable."

As they parted, the prince reflected that this unexpected boon actually originated from Wan Hong's contrived merit in rescuing Jiangxin. How ironic that his rivals' past failures to court the princess now presented his opportunity.

**Chapter 4960: Trust Earned**

That afternoon's brutal interrogations proved fruitless. Faced with tight-lipped prisoners enduring torture and deception alike, the frustrated prince slumped in his chambers that evening.

"You mustn't abandon hope so easily," came Chief Advisor Xiang's voice as he emerged from shadows. Rising to greet his mentor, the prince lamented, "All conventional methods failed. These are true deathsworn – unafraid of pain or promises."

"Ordinary tactics won't break such men," Xiang advised. "Many have no families, but others' kin are controlled by their masters. Investigate their backgrounds. Isolate and deceive them – exploit their hidden vulnerabilities through lies and psychological warfare."

When the prince moved to act, Xiang stayed him: "Seek Wan Hong's counsel. He'll provide unconventional solutions."

"You too trust him?" The prince frowned. "Uncle Zou also recommended him. What merits such faith?"

"Capability and reliability," Xiang stated simply. Recalling his past enmity with the youth at Cloud Azure Sect – how Guan Yu (Wan Hong's true identity) had bested him despite Xiang's seniority – the advisor admitted, "Though he once wounded me, I've grown to respect his prowess. His artifacts and strategic mind make him invaluable."

"Even you couldn't defeat him?" The prince marveled. "Such talent in one so young..."

"Precisely. Cultivate his alliance – it will serve you well."

Resolved, the prince decided: "I'll first thank my royal sister, then consult Wan Hong."

**Chapter 4961: Among Friends**

At the Consort's estate next morning, Jiang Yuan opened received the prince's unexpected visit. "Her Highness remains at palace with Jiangxin," he explained. "But regarding her advocacy – credit truly lies with Wan Hong. He orchestrated this through me."

"Wan Hong again?" The prince's astonishment mirrored Jiang Yuan's concern about potential enmity. Quickly clarifying, the consort added, "Consider him an ally. All friends here."

Though arriving empty-handed, the prince's sincerity pleased Jiang Yuan, who understood imperial siblings' delicate positions. As they conversed, both recognized the intricate web of favors and hidden maneuvers binding court politics – where true power often moved through unexpected channels.
