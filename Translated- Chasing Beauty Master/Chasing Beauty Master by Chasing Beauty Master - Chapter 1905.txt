“Just now, Guanyu had said the same thing. Since both of them expressed identical meanings, could they be fellow townsmen? However, Duan Ruxue didn’t reveal this thought. If they discovered this connection themselves during their meeting, the realization would carry far more emotional weight.

Guanyu shifted the topic, saying, “Sister Ruxue, I believe you’ve also heard about Chu Fan’s situation? As you know, Chu Fan is my sworn brother. He’s currently detained over the East Sea Dragon Pearl. Do you have any suggestions on how we might locate him?”

**Chapter 5006: The Agony**

“I have indeed heard of this matter,” Duan Ruxue analyzed. “But in our eyes, those perpetrators are utterly deluded. In the entire capital, only two individuals possess the stature to negotiate for the East Sea Dragon Pearl: Jiang Xin and the Grand Princess.

Apart from these two, no one else holds sufficient influence to exchange for the pearl. Forgive my bluntness, but given Chu Fan’s status as a mere performer, attempting to use him to extort Jiang Xin is inherently flawed. It’s an impossible scheme.

First, Jiang Yuan’kai would never surrender the Dragon Pearl for Chu Fan’s sake. Even if Jiang Xin desired it, no one else would consent. Thus, capturing Chu Fan was a miscalculation from the start—a futile endeavor.”

“Your reasoning is sound,” Guanyu replied. “But who might be a more plausible suspect? Everyone knows Jiang Yuan’kai and the Grand Princess would never trade the Dragon Pearl for Chu Fan’s life. Yet he remains my brother. I must exhaust every means to save him.”

Duan Ruxue continued, “This incident must involve internal collusion. When Lord Cao abducted Jiang Xin previously, it was through inside and outside coordination. I suspect the same here.

Within the capital, no one would dare act openly—too risky, too easily exposed. Outsiders alone couldn’t devise such a detailed plot to exploit Chu Fan against Jiang Xin for the Dragon Pearl. This reeks of capital insiders.

Collusion is the most logical explanation. But this complicates investigations, as the true schemers remain hidden. Countless covet the Dragon Pearl—untangling this web won’t be simple.”

Guanyu understood all too well. The true headache lay in the absence of clues. During Jiang Xin’s abduction, Du Teng’s coincidental discovery had provided leads. Now, with Chu Fan vanished without trace—no perpetrators identified, no location known, no whispers of information—they faced utter stagnation. Chu Fan lacked Jiang Xin’s luck, and Du Teng couldn’t stumble upon another fortuitous clue.

“Elder Brother Wan,” Duan Ruxue cautioned, “let me speak plainly. This differs from Jiang Xin’s capture. If Jiang Xin can’t produce the Dragon Pearl promptly—or can’t produce it at all—Chu Fan’s life hangs by a thread. Those criminals won’t keep a hostage indefinitely. Disposing of a performer would be as simple as crushing an ant.”

“I share your fears,” Guanyu admitted, frustration evident. “That’s why I’m desperate to deploy more investigators. Yet I’ve no other recourse.”

When Jiang Xin was taken, the capital had erupted—gates sealed, tens of thousands of soldiers scouring every alley and rathole. The overwhelming pressure had broken the kidnappers’ resolve. Now, circumstances reversed: Chu Fan’s disappearance drew no official concern. Only Guanyu sought him, unaided by military might.

The powerful watched this drama unfold, indifferent to a performer’s fate. Only Guanyu treated him as kin.

“The outlook appears grim,” Duan Ruxue conceded. “But take heart, Elder Brother Wan. I’ll dispatch my own agents upon returning. We’ll focus investigations within the capital—if collusion exists, traces must remain here.”

“My gratitude, Sister.” Guanyu rose. “I must find Chu Fan swiftly. As you said—his peril grows by the hour.”

Certain the Duan family bore no involvement, Guanyu returned to his inn. Donning night-clothes, he prepared to infiltrate the Second Prince’s residence—perhaps the key lay there. Though expecting little, he knew he must try. The Tang and Qin households also demanded scrutiny.

Fate proved unkind. The Second Prince was absent. The Tang estate lay deathly silent—perhaps due to the late hour, though Guanyu knew Tang Muchen still lingered at Wanyang Tavern.

Near surrender, Guanyu passed the Qin mansion on his return. The witching hour offered perfect cover for reconnaissance—even empty-handed observation held value.

The Qin family’s ambitions loomed large. Lord Qin’s machinations shadowed many schemes. Their capital influence remained formidable, bolstered by Lord Qin’s daughter marrying into the Second Prince’s household—a connection elevating their status beyond reproach.

Clad in black, Guanyu hovered above the Qin compound. Even guards dozed at this hour. As he prepared to depart, a stately structure in the central courtyard caught his eye—modest in size yet exuding grandeur.

Candlelight flickered within. Without hesitation, Guanyu descended silently onto the roof.

**Chapter 5007: Within Reason**

Landing soundlessly, Guanyu stilled, listening. Beyond the nocturnal quiet, he sensed presence within. Lifting a roof tile, he glimpsed shelves laden with books and antiques—a study, likely Lord Qin’s.

Muffled voices drew him across the roof. Peering through another gap, he witnessed three figures: Lord Qin enthroned behind a massive desk, Qin Huan standing before him, and a bearded stranger resembling a barbarian.

The bearded man declared, “If unresolved soon, our fee increases.”

“We agreed upon payment after completion,” Qin Huan retorted. “The deposit’s paid. Demanding more mid-task breaches trust!”

“Young Master Qin mistakes me,” the beard countered. “Our bargain covered capture—achieved without trace. Thus, our duty ends. Pay the balance. My men need sustenance—and funds for... recreation.”

“Confinement costs weren’t stipulated!” Qin Huan snapped. “Your fee already exceeds market rates!”

“For lesser houses, perhaps.” The beard smirked. “But the mighty Qin clan—stingy over trifles?”

Lord Qin raised a hand, silencing his son. “State your terms.”

“A thousand taels now,” the beard demanded. “Else my men might... relocate the hostage. Surely General Jiang’s daughter would pay handsomely for her beloved performer?”

**Chapter 5008: Silver Tongues**

Guanyu’s pulse quickened. The puzzle solved itself—the Qin family had hired these bandits! Now the snakes turned on their masters. Poetic justice indeed.

As suspected: internal collusion. The Qins, ever-aware of capital affairs, knew Jiang Xin’s vulnerabilities. Using outside thugs to snatch Chu Fan—only to be blackmailed by their tools.

The beard pressed his advantage: “Dawn brings either silver or the hostage delivered to Jiang Xin. Choose wisely.”

Qin Huan spat curses, but Lord Qin stayed composed. “A thousand strains our previous terms. Five hundred additional suffices.”

“Five hundred?” The beard scoffed. “Barely enough for tavern slops! The Qins—bargaining like fishwives?”

“You overstep!” Qin Huan roared.

“Do I?” The beard grinned. “My men grow restless. Without silver, they’ll seek... alternative compensation.”

Guanyu watched, torn between disgust and grim satisfaction. These vipers deserved each other. Yet Chu Fan’s life hung in this sordid balance. Every second mattered.
