Young Master Men pointed to the attendant lying nearby, completely disregarding the severity of his injuries. Whether the man lived or died mattered little to him. Even if someone perished, it would be inconsequential in his eyes. The pressing matter now was to swiftly return and summon men to seize Cuihua.

“That won’t do,” Guanyu declared with righteous confidence. “The dog belongs to you. When a pet errs, its master bears responsibility. Unless you apologize today, you shan’t leave this place.”

Xiao Zhi chuckled. “Let’s find seats nearby and observe how Guanyu handles this.” The two settled at a neighboring table. Xiao Zhi waved and called, “Miss, come here.”

A female shop assistant approached politely. “How may I assist you, gentlemen?”

“Bring us a pot of fine tea and two small dishes,” Xiao Zhi ordered. As they sipped tea and watched the spectacle, they felt no concern for Guanyu—even if he thrashed this tyrannical young master, it would serve as just retribution.

Young Master Men, astonished by Guanyu’s audacity despite knowing his identity, spat, “You dare show me such disrespect knowing I’m the City Lord’s son? Do you court death? Or perhaps wish to be banished from Qujiang City?”

Guanyu sneered. Though the other flaunted his status, such tactics held no sway over him. “Young Master Men, your noble lineage may surpass mine, but while others fear you, I do not. My demand stands: apologize, or you leave not.”

Guanyu knew the pampered heir, accustomed to bullying others, would never humble himself publicly. As the City Lord’s second son, apologizing before spectators was unthinkable. Yet his words struck a chord—unlike cowering commoners, Guanyu neither fled nor groveled.

Young Master Men’s mind raced. *He knows my station yet still challenges me. Does he scorn the City Lord’s authority? Could he possess greater backing? Yet no such figure exists in Qujiang...*

After scrutinizing Guanyu’s foreign attire, he softened his tone. “Your name and origin?”

The crowd marveled at this uncharacteristic civility. All wondered: Who dares oppose Young Master Men so boldly?

“You’re unworthy of my name,” Guanyu declared, chin raised. “Not even your father merits such knowledge.” Sensing hesitation, he amplified his pretense. “As for my origins—a mere City Lord’s son has no right to inquire. I initially sought only apology, but now I shall visit your father personally.”

Young Master Men paled. *Could he be a high-ranking official or noble?* Though the City Lord doted on his second son, he remained a just administrator beloved by citizens. The son’s previous atrocities—like torching a peasant’s home—had only earned temporary reprimands before old habits resumed.

*If this man complains to Father...* The young master shuddered at imagined consequences. Guanyu noted the shifting expressions—his bluff was working.

“You think the City Lord’s estate welcomes any vagrant?” Young Master Men tested, though fear tinged his voice.

“Then I’ll verify this myself.” Guanyu turned to leave, prompting the panicked noble to block his path—now sobered and clear-eyed.

“Stay, esteemed sir! Let us converse reasonably.” Young Master Men forced a smile. “My attendant erred—please accept my deepest apologies.” The mention of “petty City Lord’s estate” cemented his belief in Guanyu’s superior status. Offending such power meant ruin.

“Since your apology lacks sincerity, I’ll seek justice from your father. He’ll honor my request.” Guanyu maintained grave composure.

Xiao Zhi and Aze sipped tea amusedly, watching the charade unfold.

“My blindness insults your stature!” The young master bowed. “Allow me to host you at our estate tonight as apology. Let friendship blossom.”

Guanyu shook his head. “Your delayed apology proves insincere. That your father permits such misconduct warrants official censure.”

“No!” The young master blurted. “I formally apologize for my subordinate’s offense!” *Father’s position mustn’t be jeopardized!*

“As the City Lord’s second son,” Guanyu pressed, “why earlier threaten to demolish this establishment and seize someone?”

Eager to please, Young Master Men gestured upstairs. “Shall we discuss privately over tea? Since you decline our estate’s hospitality...”

After feigned deliberation, Guanyu nodded. “Very well. My throat parches.” He ascended, subtly signaling his companions.

“Who are these?” The young master eyed Xiao Zhi and Aze coldly.

“My attendants. Any objections?” Guanyu retorted.

“None! Please join us.” Young Master Men shouted upstairs: “Proprietress! Prepare your finest chamber! Send Cuihua to entertain our guest with wine and music!”

The proprietress studied Guanyu—an unfamiliar face hoodwinking the young master. Though recognizing the trio as cultivators masquerading as nobles, she played along, grateful for the intervention.

In the opulent chamber, a lavish feast materialized. Guanyu surveyed the spread. “Such extravagance for two?”

“No excess demonstrates sincerity!” The young master bowed again. “Again, I apologize.”

Guanyu waved at his “attendants.” “Join us. Waste not.”

Young Master Men’s eye twitched at servants dining with masters but forced a smile. “Naturally! Valets deserve comfort.”

“Your magnanimity befits noble lineage,” Guanyu praised as all settled.

Xiao Zhi and Aze stifled laughter while maintaining decorum.

Three courtesans entered, Cuihua among them. The proprietress announced, “Does this selection please Young Master Men?”

Deferring to Guanyu, the young master gritted, “Serve this esteemed sir well. Reward awaits.”

As the women approached, Guanyu raised a hand. “One suffices. Keep the lute player.”

Cuihua froze—why her? Guanyu’s hidden motive?

Young Master Men’s heart sank—his coveted prize snatched again. “Perhaps... another performer?”

“No. Her.” Guanyu pointed. “Others may leave.”

When Cuihua confessed inability to play the jade xiao, the young master exploded. “Useless wench! Learn your craft!”

Guanyu waved dismissively. “Enough. Her presence suffices.”

Cuihua trembled, fearing escalating demands. Yet Guanyu’s noble bearing suggested different intentions than the young master’s crude appetites. The game continued—a delicate dance of power and pretense.
