However, Wang Jun knew now was not the time to ask questions, so he held his tongue.

Guan Yu walked over and casually picked up the broadsword that had fallen to the ground.

“I told you earlier I’d give you a chance, but you failed to seize it. Do you think I should spare your wretched life?” Guan Yu said coldly.

Not only had these bandits extorted silver, but they had also tried to abduct the man’s daughters. Such despicable acts were intolerable. This scum would only bring endless trouble if left alive.

“S-Sir, I was wrong! Please spare me! I beg you!” The bandit leader, now half-dead from Guan Yu’s aura strike, had lost all defiance. He knelt on the ground, kowtowing frantically.

With a feeble shout, the leader wheezed, “You idiots, what the hell are you staring at? Hurry up and kowtow to beg for mercy! Do you all want to die here?”

At his words, over fifty men thudded to their knees, bowing and pleading for their lives.

“Sir, we…we just formed this group! Today was our first raid! We never imagined crossing paths with you! We deserve death! We were blind fools! Please, have mercy!” the bandit leader implored.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “First raid? No wonder you’re so incompetent. But even newborn wolves show greed. To demand silver and hostages on your first outing—such audacity is beyond reason.”

“We’ll never do it again! Spare us, and we’ll vanish forever!” The leader’s only thought was survival. Nothing else mattered now.

“Leave. I never intended to kill you. Go,” Guan Yu said dismissively.

Supported by two underlings, the leader staggered away. In their haste, they abandoned all their plundered silver, fleeing empty-handed.

Approaching the old caravan master, Guan Yu asked, “Are you unharmed? The bandits are gone. Your daughters need not fear anymore.”

“Quick! Kneel and thank our savior!” the old man urged, nudging his daughters to kowtow.

“No need.” Guan Yu steadied them. “You should conserve your strength. The danger has passed. Best depart swiftly.”

Noticing the remaining cargo wagons, Wang Jun retrieved a sack of silver. “Guan Yu, what about this?”

“Give it to them, along with the goods. We’ve no use for it,” Guan Yu replied. They were in haste and couldn’t afford delays.

Wang Jun grinned. “With so much silver, can’t I take a cut? At least let this effort count for something.”

Guan Yu smiled wordlessly. The silver was ownerless now—let whoever wanted it take their share. He had no interest in petty riches. After Wang Jun took his portion, the remainder would go to the old man.

Ironically, the ordeal had brought the old master unexpected fortune. Not only were his daughters saved, but he also gained silver and goods beyond expectation.

As Guan Yu turned to leave, one daughter rushed forward. “Benefactor, may I ask your honorable name? I wish to remember it and repay your kindness someday.”

“I’m Guan Yu. Call me Brother Guan if you like. This was a trivial act—I seek no reward.” With that, he and Wang Jun rejoined their traveling party. They still had considerable distance to cover before reaching Luotuo Town. If delayed further, they’d arrive past midnight.

Wang Jun remarked, “They’re likely heading to Luotuo Town too. Why not travel together?”

“Their wagons move faster. The cold worsens—an elderly man and two girls shouldn’t catch chill trudging at our pace. Let them go ahead,” Guan Yu decided.

Upon returning, A Ze hurried over. “What took so long? What happened?”

“Bandits raiding a caravan. Simple enough,” Wang Jun shrugged.

“Resolved? Can we move on?” A Ze pressed.

“It’s settled. Guan Yu helped an old man with two daughters. He nearly killed their leader with one strike. Ended quickly,” Wang Jun said.

“Killed someone?!” A Ze gasped. Siqi overheard and approached, alarmed at the thought of casual killing.

Wang Jun chuckled. “Joking! Guan Yu just wounded the leader. They begged mercy, he let them go. We returned. That’s all.”

Clapping his hands, Guan Yu addressed the group. “Stay alert. We press on. Rest awaits in Luotuo Town.”

The caravan resumed its journey. The air grew colder. Passing the raid site, they found it deserted—the old master had efficiently cleared his wagons.

**Chapter 4437: Reaching the Destination**

The seasoned caravan master alternated between transporting his own goods and others’, rarely idle. After Guan Yu left, he settled his daughters into a wagon, bundled them in quilts, and tethered the horses in tandem. By linking each subsequent horse to the preceding wagon’s tail, he could steer the entire convoy from the front.

Luotuo Town wasn’t far now. This makeshift arrangement would suffice until arrival, where goods could be traded for silver. At least the trip hadn’t been in vain.

Fearful of the bandits’ return, the master drove his convoy relentlessly. By the time Guan Yu’s group passed through, they were long gone.

The sky darkened, clouds smothering any light. Wind bit sharper, cold gnawing through layers. Guan Yu regretted not packing warmer clothes. Siqi fared better, thanks to Lin Chen’s thick borrowed coat.

Ahead, faint lights flickered—Luotuo Town at last. It was nearly midnight.

A Ze wished for wings to fly straight to an inn. The town, true to its name, remained ordinary. Once a camel-breeding ranch established by a wealthy merchant, it had evolved into a humble settlement. Though expanded over years, its core trade persisted—camels.

Harsh climate stunted agriculture, leaving camels as one of few surviving livestock. Positioned near northern deserts, the town served as a crucial supply stop for desert travelers. Sustained by steady traffic, it thrived modestly.

“Finally! Hot food and rest!” A Ze dismounted, exhausted. The disciples, accustomed to cushioned sect life, wearied visibly from the arduous trek.

Guan Yu instructed Lin Chen to secure lodgings. Meanwhile, the group warmed themselves in a nearby tea house.

Inside, Guan Yu noticed a ghost butterfly carving behind the counter—a Demon Soul Sect outpost. Fitting, given the town’s proximity to desert expeditions, especially with the upcoming Eight-Sided Drum competition in Miao City.

“Waiter! Hot tea!” A Ze called. The nearly empty shop suddenly bustled with over twenty patrons.

The proprietor observed curiously but focused on service. “Right away, honored guests!”

A waiter scurried over, wiping tables. “Traveling so late? First time here? The cold here strikes fast after sunset.”

Lin Chen grimaced. “Freezing! Look at my hands!”

The waiter nodded. “Rare to see night travelers. Passing through to the desert?”

Guan Yu recognized the probing. Let them know—Yunqing Sect’s participation in Miao City’s affairs was expected.

As tea arrived, A Ze sighed. “Ah, warmth!”

“Can’t the tea shut you up?” Wang Jun snapped, unnerved by the Demon Soul Sect presence. His blood toxin required discreetly obtaining antidotes here before the desert journey.

Lin Chen returned, reporting inns were small. “Two inns—seven rooms and four. We’ll split up.”

Guan Yu stood. “Settle in early. Rest well tomorrow.”

**Chapter 4438: Complimentary Offer**

Wang Jun seized the moment to seek the outpost’s steward for antidotes. Meanwhile, the waiter returned with dishes.

“Compliments of the house. May I ask your origins? Desert-bound?”

Guan Yu cut in, tossing silver. “From Niu Town. We’ll call if needed.”

The waiter retreated. Wang Jun excused himself to locate the outpost. Lin Chen, unaware of sect ties, had secured two nearby inns.

“Let’s move. Rest well—tomorrow’s a break,” Guan Yu announced. The group dispersed into the bitter night, longing for respite.
