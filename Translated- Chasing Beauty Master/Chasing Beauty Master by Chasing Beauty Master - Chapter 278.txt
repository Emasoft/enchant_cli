“Oh?” Guan Yu sneered, not bothering to conceal his disdain as he struck back: “I see no need for that. Given your level of skill, even if I explained my treatment methods, you’d be utterly clueless. Stealing techniques? Don’t even think about it.”

The doctor stiffened, his face twisting in humiliation. He understood all too well that Guan Yu was mocking his earlier meddling during the treatment. Yet he couldn’t refute it—after all, his own skills paled in comparison.

Even under Guan Yu’s icy glare, the doctor dared not lash out. Instead, he felt compelled to ingratiate himself. Guan Yu’s miraculous healing methods were worth currying favor for, even if he couldn’t steal them. Associating with such skill could boost his reputation—a path to fame and fortune.

After all, Guan Yu and his family would leave once the hospitalization ended, while the doctor remained. By maneuvering behind the scenes, he could claim partial credit for Guan Zhongfu’s rapid recovery. Wealth and prestige would follow.

With this in mind, the doctor plastered on an obsequious smile. “Sir, I presume you’ll need traditional medicine to recuperate the patient. Our hospital has a TCM department. If you’d like, I can take you there.”

Guan Yu studied the doctor’s sudden about-face with amusement. He saw through the man’s ulterior motives but chose not to expose them, nodding slightly. “Then I’ll trouble you.”

“No trouble at all,” the doctor replied eagerly, waving his hands.

Turning to Guan Tian, Guan Yu said, “Brother, I’ll get medicine for Dad. Stay here with him. Once things are settled, we’ll deal with those who need dealing with. The Guan family won’t be bullied so easily.”

Guan Tian’s expression darkened as he nodded solemnly.

As Guan Yu left with the doctor, Lin Dong followed, claiming curiosity about the herbal prescription. Having survived in the wilderness dealing with venomous creatures, Lin Dong knew pharmacology well. He wanted to see if Guan Yu’s formula held secrets—though both knew the investigation system wasn’t just for healing.

With the doctor’s connections, obtaining the herbs proved swift. However, when Guan Yu returned to the ward, he found a crowd clustered outside—trouble brewed within.

A domineering voice boomed from inside: “I’m already doing you a favor visiting this old man! Don’t push your luck! I’ll make sure you get nothing!”

Guan Yu’s face hardened. Pushing through the crowd, he kicked open the door to reveal Luo Quanyuan—a lackey of Hengxin Real Estate’s boss—berating Guan Tian. Without hesitation, Guan Yu struck, his brutal efficiency leaving Luo writhing on the floor.

“If you dare kick him, I’ll break that leg,” Guan Yu warned coldly.

Defiant, Luo Quanyuan lashed out. A sickening crack followed as Guan Yu shattered his ankle. When police arrived, Guan Yu simply claimed it was “friendly sparring.”

As officers questioned the scene, Luo seized the chance to call his boss—the feared “De Ge.” Though fearing retribution, anything was better than enduring Guan Yu’s wrath.

The stage was set for reckoning.
