“Young lady, may I ask your name? There is indeed a guest named Xiao Zhi here.” Magistrate Mao paused before adding, “My subordinates meant no harm. They merely enforce strict vigilance as troublemakers often come here. Please do not take offense.”

“I am Du Bingyan (Frozen Swallow). Could you ask Xiao Zhi to come out?” she replied, finding this official more reasonable. “While I understand their duty, claiming innocence would be false. If your City Lord’s guards take silver yet falsely accuse civilians, they hardly deserve their posts.”

“I shall discipline them thoroughly and ensure such incidents never recur,” Magistrate Mao assured, smiling as he instructed a soldier: “Go inquire if anyone recognizes a Miss Du Bingyan.”

The magistrate’s approach seemed fair—unlike his guards who acted like rabid watchdogs, deluded by false superiority. Knowing his subordinates’ misconduct, Magistrate Mao sought to placate Du Bingyan, fearing her complaints might tarnish the mansion’s reputation before the Prince.

Inside, the Prince conversed with Guan Yu while Wang Jun absently watched a theatrical performance of Tang Seng’s pilgrimage to the Western Heaven. Xiao Zhi, disinterested in the spectacle, stuffed his mouth with delicacies.

A soldier entered, bowing to the Prince. “Your Highness, Magistrate Mao inquires if anyone knows Du Bingyan.”

Hearing the name, Xiao Zhi nearly choked. “Where is she?” he exclaimed, rising.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Your Highness, this Du Bingyan is my friend’s… intimate companion.”

“Splendid!” the Prince laughed. “Invite her to dine with us—the more, the merrier!”

Du Bingyan lacked such privilege—even the magistrate’s family remained excluded. Guan Yu interjected, “Xiao Zhi, since she’s here, meet her outside. See if she needs assistance.”

Wiping grease from his lips, Xiao Zhi bowed to the Prince and departed.

Magistrate Mao, preparing to admonish Du Bingyan, was startled when Xiao Zhi emerged with the returning soldier.

Noticing her disheveled clothes and battle-worn appearance, Xiao Zhi urgently asked, “Xiao Yan, what happened?”

Overwhelmed, Du Bingyan threw herself into his arms, finding refuge in his steadfast presence. “You’re truly here! The physician didn’t lie—this is wonderful!”

“How proceeded your parents’ funeral arrangements?” Xiao Zhi asked gently. “When we returned to the clinic, you’d already taken their remains.”

“With your friend’s gold leaves, I bought fine coffins—my final act for them. Later, thinking you might seek me, I returned to the clinic and learned you were here.”

“Does your family need further assistance? I’ve time today, but we depart tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow?” Her eyes clouded with reluctance.

Magistrate Mao tactfully withdrew. “I’ll leave you to reminisce. Feel free to wander the premises.”

Xiao Zhi bowed apologetically. “We’ve troubled you enough, Magistrate. Please attend to your duties.”

Chapter 4017: Conditions

Xiao Zhi recognized Du Bingyan’s plight—evident from the rope in a guard’s hand. Yet amid delicate circumstances, he prioritized reunion over confrontation.

A dilemma gnawed at him: bringing Du Bingyan on their perilous journey to the capital with the Prince posed dangers, yet abandoning her to loneliness seemed equally unthinkable. As they walked the mansion’s corridors, he ventured, “Xiao Yan, I wish to care for you always. Will you follow me?”

Her cheeks flushed—she adored his blunt yet guileless sincerity. Though her shy answer was clear, practical hurdles remained.

Without combat skills beyond petty thievery, she’d be vulnerable on the road. Yet sending her to distant Yunqing Sect proved impractical. “I leave tomorrow,” he began haltingly.

“Must you go? Can’t you stay?” she pleaded.

“This mission from my sect—to protect Prince Zou en route to the capital—is secret. You must tell no one.” At her eager nod, he continued, “Though sects seldom mingle with officials, many covertly rely on imperial patronage. The Emperor, ailing and disenchanted with his sons, summoned the Prince—once my sect brother—who saved His Majesty years past. Now, rival factions plot to intercept us. We guard him incognito. Having you near would endanger us both.”

Du Bingyan understood. “I’ll await your return here. Promise you’ll come back safely.”

“I vow it.” Yet anxiety lingered—how would she fare alone?

“I’ve survived this long,” she reassured. “Keep your focus. I’ll manage.”

Pressing four gold ingots into her hands, Xiao Zhi insisted, “Take these. They’ll sustain you until I return from Yunqing Sect.”

Chapter 4018: Lawlessness

“I can’t! Your friend already gave generously—”

“This eases my mind. My companion is wealthy—we lack nothing.” Relenting, she accepted the troth-gift.

“I’ll visit my parents’ graves tomorrow,” she said. “I may not bid farewell.”

“I should pay respects too, but duty binds me here.”

“They’d understand. My home—” she described its location, vowing, “I’ll wait there forever if needed.”

“I’ll find you,” he promised, embracing her flushed face.

Meanwhile, Magistrate Mao apologized to the Prince: “A misunderstanding—the guards feared assassins. The lady resorted to the grievance drum.”

Guan Yu bowed. “Our profound apologies for the disturbance.”

“No harm done,” the Prince waved. “Friends of Xiao Zhi are friends of mine.”

Outside, the theatrical battle between the Monkey King and Bull Demon King escalated—masked assassins closed in. With key guards absent, the performers seized their moment, clashing toward the hall.

Guan Yu watched keenly. These were the same men from the noodle shop—poised to strike when defenses seemed weakest.
