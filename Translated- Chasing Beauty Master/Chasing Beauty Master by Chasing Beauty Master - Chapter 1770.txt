The Crimson Lotus Sect was no exception. Though Elder Zhao was formidable, even the strongest would eventually tire. Seizing this opportune moment to have his disciples prepare a combined spell was the wisest choice.

The Demon Soul Sect, however, faced a different situation. While they too possessed collaborative spells, none of the dozen individuals behind the Right Envoy knew how to execute them. These were high-ranking members of the sect, untrained in such tactics. Yet they remained active, each mindlessly casting spells at Elder Zhao’s shield.

Outnumbered, the Crimson Lotus Sect relied on Elder Zhao alone to hold the front line. The Demon Soul Sect clearly struggled, and if the enemy disciples succeeded in unleashing their spell, the Right Envoy’s side would be forced onto the defensive.

*This Elder Zhao is truly remarkable,* Guan Yu thought. *The strength of this shield is unlike anything I’ve encountered.* He silently calculated that even exhausting his spiritual energy wouldn’t breach it. The elder’s centuries of cultivation were no empty boast.

Of course, if Guan Yu tapped into his internal energy, a few Battle Qi Slashes would shatter it. Spell shields excelled against magical attacks but offered scant defense against internal energy. A single ordinary slash might suffice.

The Demon Soul Sect’s members proved cunning. Among them stood the Fat Altar Master, who had previously wagered with Xiaomei. Positioned near the Right Envoy, he clearly held high status.

“Disperse!” the Fat Altar Master bellowed. “Focus all spells on their elder!”

By scattering, they negated the Crimson Lotus Sect’s impending area-effect spell. Guan Yu grudgingly acknowledged the Fat Altar Master’s tactical acumen.

As spells pummeled Elder Zhao’s shield, Guan Yu noted it could still hold awhile longer. The Right Envoy, however, recognized the enemy’s strategy. With a flourish of her Soul-Devouring Whip, she toppled a nearby tree toward the shield.

Guan Yu had seen this weapon before during his time with Wang Xiaorong. A gift from the Demon Lord himself, this high-grade magical instrument comprised over two meters of steel rings studded with gemstones, its tip ending in three dagger-like blades. When infused with spiritual energy, the gems shimmered brilliantly, transforming the whip into a lethal dance of light.

Elder Zhao countered by darting from his shield to sever the falling tree, only to retreat under a fresh onslaught of spells. Meanwhile, crimson lotus patterns glowed beneath the Crimson Lotus disciples’ feet—their combined spell neared completion.

The Right Envoy’s Fire Phoenix shrieked overhead before diving into the shield. The resulting explosion drowned even the waterfall’s roar. As the shield shattered, Demon Soul Sect spells ravaged the exposed disciples.

Elder Zhao made his desperate move. Crushing the Xuan Paper in his hands, he summoned a glowing portal. “Incredible,” Guan Yu murmured. The elder had destroyed his own high-grade magical instrument—a beast-hide parchment fused with liquefied spirit gems—to create an escape route.

**Chapter 4631: Fleeing for Life**

After ushering his disciples through, Elder Zhao vanished into the portal moments before it collapsed. Only battle scars remained where the Crimson Lotus forces had stood.

The Right Envoy, her face impassive, recalled her whip. “Regroup and scout the area.” Her exhaustion mirrored the sect members’, all drained from relentless spellcasting.

Guan Yu gained new respect for the Crimson Lotus Sect. Elder Zhao’s shield had withstood overwhelming assault until the Phoenix struck. Without that portal, none would have escaped the Demon Soul elites—all Altar Masters or higher.

The Xuan Paper’s secret lay in its creation: spirit gems melded with mystical beast hide, forming vascular-like patterns across its surface. By releasing its stored energy, Elder Zhao had conjured a teleportation gate—a rare skill known to fewer than five cultivators.

This gambit carried dire risks. Portal destinations proved random—a desert, volcano, or ocean depths all loomed as possibilities. Yet facing annihilation, the Crimson Lotus disciples embraced the unknown.

**Chapter 4632: Discovered**

“Why linger?” a Demon Soul cultivator mocked, discovering a wounded Crimson Lotus disciple. “Did your elder abandon you?”

“Mercy, sir!” The disciple trembled. “The portal... it only moved me here!”

Nearby, Wang Jun’s suppressed chuckle betrayed their position. The Right Envoy whirled, whip at the ready. Guan Yu stepped forward, trailed by three companions.

“Aunt Right Envoy!” he called cheerfully. “You grow more radiant with each meeting!”

The Right Envoy’s stern expression softened. “Still silver-tongued, I see. I’m relieved Xiaorong didn’t join you.”

“I’d never endanger her,” Guan Yu replied, sensing Siqi’s sidelong glance.

Their exchange recalled their last encounter at Elder Meng Hua’s tomb, where Guan Yu had claimed the Eight-Sided Drum technique for the Cloud Azure Sect. “This time,” the Right Envoy noted, “it seems our sects will clash again.”

“Other factions remain,” Guan Yu countered. “The True Sun Sect still contends, and the Crimson Lotus retains forces.”

“Yet you watched our battle unmoved,” she chided. “Should Elder Zhao learn of your fraternization, even Sect Master Xuan Ming might struggle to protect you.”

Her warning carried hidden concern. The Right Envoy’s cold demeanor thawed around Guan Yu and Xiaorong, whose bond she secretly favored. For now, survival depended on maintaining this fragile rapport—and ensuring Siqi’s jealousy stayed hidden.
