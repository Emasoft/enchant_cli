His left hand lingered on Liu Shilei's voluptuous hips, gently caressing as he slowly rolled her pencil skirt up to her waist. The flesh-colored stockings revealed a tantalizing glimpse of purple that quickened his pulse. Liu Shilei responded immediately to his touch, soft moans escaping her lips.

Guan Yu deepened their French kiss while deftly unbuttoning her blazer. The patterned purple bra barely contained her full breasts. His right hand slid behind her back, skillfully releasing the clasp. Freed from restraint, her rosy peaks hardened under his experienced ministrations.

Sweeping her onto the bed, Guan Yu buried his face between her breasts like a suckling infant. The pink buds stiffened under his practiced tongue. His free hand worked downward, peeling the stockings to her ankles, exposing milky thighs to the cool air.

Timing his moves with predatory precision, Guan Yu removed her lavender lace panties at the peak of her arousal. Their collision ignited like tinder meeting flame – two naked bodies entwined in Liu's dormitory, passionate cries echoing as pent-up desires erupted.

When their fervor finally subsided, glistening limbs remained intertwined. Liu Shilei traced circles on his chest, murmuring, "Promise me you'll stop courting trouble. When the police took you away... I was terrified."

"Never again," Guan Yu vowed, tightening his embrace.

"Then... once more?" A blush bloomed across her cheeks.

Surprise flickered across his face – her first time initiating intimacy. As her cherry lips descended, Guan Yu roared like a beast reclaimed. The room soon resonated with carnal symphony anew.

By noon's light, Liu bustled in the kitchen while Guan Yu marveled at his fortune. This woman alone would make any man's life complete – yet she wasn't his only blessing.

The doorbell interrupted his reverie. A vision in amber down jacket and black leggings stood framed in the doorway, curves defying winter layers. Guan Yu's expression frosted as he returned to his computer without acknowledgment.

Mo Ling's hopeful smile withered. Since their last disastrous encounter, she'd ached for reconciliation. Now his indifference crushed her heart. "Who is it?" Liu called.

"It's me," Mo Ling forced cheerfulness, joining the kitchen.

"Mo Ling! No need to help – go relax," Liu insisted, radiant from recent passion.

Shaking her head, Mo Ling busied herself with vegetables. The kitchen's warmth couldn't thaw her icy regret. Liu noted red-rimmed eyes. "Guan Yu doesn't hold grudges," she whispered.

A bitter smile twisted Mo Ling's lips. Whatever nascent feelings existed between them had frozen solid. Silent tears fell as she recalled Guan Yu's former tenderness.

At lunch, Guan Yu lavished attention on Liu while ignoring Mo Ling's presence. After picking at her food, Mo Ling fled – tears streaming as the door slammed behind her.

"Why treat her so coldly?" Liu pressed later.

Guan Yu lit a cigarette. "Spoiled brats need lessons. Let her reflect." His smirk softened. "But for your sake, a sincere apology would suffice."

Liu shook her head fondly. After her departure for work, Guan Yu wandered campus until Wang Zhen's call interrupted his girl-watching.

"Celebrating the Men's Department tonight?" Guan Yu decided. "A-Sa-Di Club, nine o'clock."

As dusk fell, Guan Yu encountered Fu Linlin confronting her ex-lover. When the man struck her, Guan Yu intervened with brutal efficiency.

"I detest men who hit women," he stated coldly, pummeling the brute into unconsciousness.

Fu Linlin clung to him tearfully. "You still care!"

Guan Yu disentangled himself. "We're ghosts of who we were. That naive boy died long ago."

Her hopeful smile shattered as he walked away.

That evening, Guan Yu found himself herding an unlikely entourage to the club – his villa's female residents insisting on joining. Four beauties flanking him drew envious stares, especially when Feng Xin arrived in a Mercedes.

"Department bonding?" Feng Xin declared, brooking no argument. Even timid Du Xiaojuan and blushing Zhao Jinger joined the expedition. As the engine purred, Guan Yu sighed – tonight's "celebration" promised chaos.
