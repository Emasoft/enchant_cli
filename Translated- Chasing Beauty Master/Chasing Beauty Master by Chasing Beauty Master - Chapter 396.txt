“Fuck! I’m done thinking—I’m going home!”

Perhaps to flaunt his victory to Guan Yu, Li Xi had barely settled Song Qifeng into the car after leaving the café before slamming the door shut. Spotting Guan Yu, Li Xi hesitated but said nothing, slipping into the driver’s seat. Despite his face swelling like a pig’s head, Song Qifeng’s lips still curled into a grin.

A grin dripping with thick mockery.

“Fuck! Keep laughing and I’ll make your face swell even more!”

Song Qifeng snorted coldly, mouthing a silent threat at Guan Yu: “Just wait and see!”

Damn it! If Li Xi hadn’t been in the car, Guan Yu would’ve used his system to sabotage this pig’s brakes...

...

At Shangshang Bar in Beijing’s Workers’ Stadium, Guan Yu was nearly drunk by the time Lin Dong arrived. He lay slumped over the bar, half-conscious, as a sultry woman poured him another drink.

Lin Dong shooed the woman away, ordered a drink, and pretended to lunge at Guan Yu.

“Fuck! Have you no sympathy? I just got dumped!” Guan Yu suddenly roared, sitting upright.

Lin Dong, long aware of his friend’s sobriety, replied impassively, “If you can get dumped, then pigs can climb trees.”

With a harem rivaling ancient emperors, how could this playboy ever experience heartbreak?

Guan Yu glared, momentarily speechless, before retorting, “Fuck you, loveless bachelor!”

“Bachelor?” Lin Dong chuckled wryly. Perhaps it was true.

“Wait—are you... in love?” Guan Yu gaped at Lin Dong’s uncharacteristic smile. In all their years together, he’d never seen the stone-faced man grin—let alone with such lecherous delight.

Ignoring Guan Yu’s probing stare, Lin Dong sipped his drink. “You didn’t call me here for gossip.”

“Of course not! I’m telling you—I got dumped!”

“Could’ve fooled me.”

Fuming internally, Guan Yu acknowledged his masochism—why seek comfort from this bastard? Abandoning hope, he changed tack: “Look into someone named Song Qifeng.”

“Song Qifeng?” Lin Dong’s brow furrowed. After a long pause, he asked, “The one from Guangdong?”

“Not sure, but he has a southern accent.”

“If it’s who I think... he’s the only target I ever spared.”

“Oh?” Guan Yu leaned in, intrigued. Anyone surviving Lin Dong’s blade must be significant.

“Years ago, I took a contract on him. But as my blade touched his throat, the client canceled.” Lin Dong’s tone turned clipped. Though the broker had recalled the hit, his code demanded blood—so he’d left a scar on Song’s neck instead.

“Big players can make brokers break rules. Normally, canceling a hit requires hiring rival killers to intercept. But with Song... my broker simply called it off.”

“Meaning his backer pressured your broker directly?”

“Scared?” Lin Dong side-eyed him.

“Of what? He’s human. And I handle humans just fine.” Guan Yu smirked. As a quasi-superhuman, fearing ordinary men would be pathetic.

Lin Dong studied him pensively. Despite their camaraderie, Guan Yu’s true capabilities remained shrouded.

As they spoke, commotion erupted from a corner booth...

Chapter 992: The Backer?

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened when he recognized the figure on the sofa. He strode over.

Song Xiaoya, a college junior working at the bar to support her family, trembled like a cornered fawn. She’d spilled wine on a patron’s trousers, and his tattooed entourage now loomed over her.

“S-sir, I’ll pay for the cleaning...” she stammered.

“Pay? This is designer! Thousands!” a thug barked.

A languid voice interrupted: “Li Yu? Since when do crime lords bully students?”

Guan Yu’s arrival broke the spell. Song Xiaoya darted behind him, pulse racing.

“Don’t worry, little sister. I’ve got you.”

Little sister? She peeked at her protector—barely older than herself, yet radiating safety.

Li Yu’s jaw clenched. This man had destroyed his gang, his legacy. Only vengeance stayed his hand.

“What brings you here, Guan Yu?”

“Same as you—drinks. Or did you buy the place after your gang collapsed?” Guan Yu’s smirk deepened. “How’s your crew faring since fleeing Beijing?”

Li Yu lunged up, but a pale hand restrained him. “Sit.”

To Guan Yu’s astonishment, the once-proud gang lord obeyed.

The stranger smiled. “So you’re Guan Yu. Sit.”

“You’re a Li? I beat one this morning—any relation?”

“Li Bing? No. Though his grandfather’s no pushover.” The warning carried hidden bait—testing Guan Yu’s mettle through proxy conflict.

As they parried, Lin Dong tensed. This youth exuded danger beneath courteous veneer.

“Drink?” The stranger gestured to wine.

“Where’s the baijiu?” Guan Yu complained. “Call this a bar?”

A thug muttered about白酒 not belonging in clubs. Guan Yu shot back: “No culture! Li Yu, your lackeys’ quality matches their numbers now.”

Li Yu’s composure cracked. “I won’t endure your insults!”

“Insults? This is pity. I’d fire such idiots.”

“Enough.” The stranger raised a hand. “Li Yu works for me now. Let bygones be.”

Guan Yu arched a brow. “Begging?”

“If needed.”

“Fine. I’m magnanimous to losers.”

Lin Dong nearly choked. Magnanimous? Since when?

Later, Li Yu confronted his new master: “Why yield to him?”

The youth swirled his wine. “Know why Guan Yu thrives? His woman is Wen Baoguo’s daughter.”

Li Yu paled. The National Security Minister’s son-in-law?

“Being a kept man,” the stranger mused, “is talent too.”

...

Chapter 993: The Gigolo...

Lin Dong’s unease grew. This “Li Shao” hid depths no one plumbed. As Guan Yu left unharmed, schemes coiled in the shadows.

“If he’s Wen’s puppet...” Li Yu began.

The youth smiled. “Precisely why he’s worth observing. Let him dance awhile longer.”
