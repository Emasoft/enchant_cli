The situation in the arena suddenly shifted. Though Zhouyang Academy hosted today's event, the referees—two professional taekwondo judges hired externally—showed no bias. Wu Chumei's thrown drink bottle resulted in Zhouyang's disqualification, granting Zhang Han from Kaihuang Academy an instant victory.

Gasps filled the arena as the referee announced the verdict. No one had expected such an abrupt conclusion to the first match. None blamed the referees for the rightful call, nor dared criticize Wu Chumei herself.

Flustered, Wu Chumei rushed to the center, pleading, “I’m so sorry, Yunqing! I didn’t mean for this to happen!”

Qian Yunqing shook his head resignedly, refusing to rebuke her. Meanwhile, Zhang Han bounced gleefully, blowing him a playful kiss of gratitude.

Enraged, Wu Chumei lunged at Zhang Han with a kick. Qian Yunqing moved to intervene but faltered too late. Zhang Han effortlessly swayed her serpentine waist, dodging the strike. With a lollipop in hand, she smeared Wu’s cheek before sliding the sticky treat into her collar.

The crowd gaped anew as Zhang Han teased, “Your collar’s too loose—let me cover that up. And since your chest is flat, this’ll add some padding!” She then skipped toward Guan Yu.

Humiliated, Wu Chumei tried to retaliate but was ordered away by Zhouyang’s faculty. Bitterly vowing revenge, she stormed off.

Zhang Han plopped onto Guan Yu’s lap, whining, “I’m exhausted! Hand over the snacks, Brother-in-law—I wasted half a lollipoo!”

Guan Yu sighed, passing her a plastic bag. “You’re such a mischievous imp.” He pinched her chubby cheek.

“Do you like naughty imps like me?” she giggled.

Before Guan Yu could reply, the referee called the next match: Chen Tianxiao versus Zhao Yan. Zhouyang’s star fighter had already fallen to Zhang Han. Chen swiftly defeated Zhao Yan, while Kong Jian capitalized on Wang Hu’s defensive lapse.

Guan Yu subdued Sun Linlin in one move, concluding the quarterfinals. The advancing schools were Kaihuang, Lanzhe, Linyuan, and Shiji Garden. Yet all of City A buzzed about Zhang Han’s scandalous victory.

**Chapter 1890: Giving Up a Seat**

That afternoon, Yang Conghan called Guan Yu to her home, where Zhang Han lounged like a princess. Jin Hua served fruit while urging, “Please watch over Zhang Han during tomorrow’s competition.”

“Don’t worry, Auntie! I’ll stick to Brother-in-law like glue—even follow him to the bathroom!” Zhang Han grabbed a banana.

Guan Yu resigned himself to babysitting the clingy girl. To placate her, Yang Conghan took her shopping for 5,000 yuan worth of snacks.

Lan Yu then phoned, demanding to accompany Guan Yu as his plus-one. Though he’d planned to bring the docile Amei, Lan Yu’s tantrums wore him down. She even barged into Xue Jing’s villa at Qiaoyuan District, luggage in tow.

Amei graciously yielded her spot when Lan Yu proposed usurping Zhang Han’s companion quota. Zhang Han, now content with Guan Yu’s company, relinquished her slot.

**Chapter 1891: Room Assignments**

At dawn, Guan Yu drove his van to fetch Zhang Han, whose snacks overflowed the trunk. Lan Yu’s refusal to vacate the passenger seat sparked a feud.

“Why should you sit here? Move!” Zhang Han yanked Lan Yu’s arm.

“Who are you to order me?” Lan Yu retorted.

Guan Yu threatened to abandon both unless they behaved. Reluctantly, Lan Yu retreated to the back, mollified by his explanation: “Zhang Han’s under my guardianship. Don’t make this harder.”

The four-hour drive proved torturous as Zhang Han chattered nonstop, demanding snacks and bathroom breaks until Guan Yu stuffed the cabin with treats. By journey’s end, he felt decades older.

At the coastal resort Shanhai Bian, room assignments placed Guan Yu (Room 1515) and Zhang Han (1516) as neighbors. The sleeping arrangement debate reignited upon entering the spacious suite.

“I’m staying with Brother-in-law!” Zhang Han thrust her keycard at Amei.

Lan Yu snapped, “We’re his girlfriends—you’re overstepping!”

Zhang Han flopped onto the king bed. “We can all share! I don’t mind seeing him naked!”

“We’ll be doing *couple things*,” Lan Yu hissed.

“So can I!”

Guan Yu finally erupted: “Amei stays with me. The rest take the other room.”

Stunned silence followed. At lunch, their entourage drew stares—especially when a gawking waiter smashed expensive wine. The manager’s shrill scolding amused them as they explored the bustling tourist haven.
