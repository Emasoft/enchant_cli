Guan Yu slowly set down his teacup and began grinning foolishly. "Seems luck's still on my side. Alright—I'm all in."

With a sweeping motion, Guan Yu pushed his remaining chips to the center of the table. The room erupted in commotion, though the crowd was sparse—no more than a dozen people in the vast space.

Earlier, the five players had each added another 50 million to the pot, bringing their individual stakes to 100 million.

Luo Cheng nearly panicked, his arm trembling as he handed over 50 million to Guan Yu, sweat dripping from his brow.

Now, Luo Cheng felt his vision darken, his mind reeling. The round wasn't even over, yet Guan Yu had recklessly gone all-in with the additional 50 million. This was pure impulsiveness.

While others buzzed with excitement, Guan Yu himself stood trembling. He leaned forward on the table, eyes locked on the three remaining players. "I'm all in. Are you calling?"

The three men's lips twitched under his gaze. This guy's a madman, they thought.

Fatty Ma gritted his teeth. His visible cards showed three Kings, with a final Ace. Only one Ace remained unaccounted for—a near-impossible chance it lay in Guan Yu's hand. He refused to believe Guan Yu held three Aces.

After a brief hesitation, a ruthless glint flashed in Fatty Ma's eyes. He shoved his chips forward. "I'm all in too."

Boss Sun startled at this second act of madness, an uneasy premonition coiling in his gut.

When he saw the final card match his desperate prayers—the Queen of Clubs—he nearly leaped up to thank the Bodhisattvas. But the thought vanished as quickly as it came.

He held three Queens, yet Fatty Ma likely had three Kings. Why else would he go all in? As for Guan Yu—Boss Sun dismissed him outright. Besides Fatty Ma's Ace, the remaining one lay in his own hand as the hidden card.

Thus, Boss Sun mentally eliminated Guan Yu from contention.

With no retreat left after investing tens of millions, Boss Sun swallowed hard and pushed his chips forward, clinging to slim hope against Fatty Ma's possible bluff.

Unlike the others fixated on cards, Zhou Jin's gaze darted between the players, lingering longest on Guan Yu—the enigma he couldn't decipher.

Drawing a deep breath, Zhou Jin declared solemnly, "I call."

The table now held a mountain of chips worth 400 million, dazzling to behold.

"Show your hands," barked Fatty Ma, confidence oozing from his three Kings. He flipped his hidden card. "Three Kings! This pot's mine!"

Boss Sun's face turned ashen as hope died. Of course Fatty Ma would dare go all-in with three Kings. Why had he, with mere three Queens, joined this madness?

At that moment, Zhou Jin rose with a smirk, revealing his cards. "You celebrated too soon. My full house—three Nines and two Jacks—beats your Kings."

Fatty Ma's laughter died mid-chuckle.

"Apologies," Guan Yu interjected softly, flipping his hidden Ten. "My three Tens and pair of Aces seem to edge you both."

**Chapter 597: A Slight Headache**

The soft statement detonated like thunder. All eyes snapped to Guan Yu, whose mocking smile mirrored Zhou Jin's earlier arrogance.

Fatty Ma's three Kings, Zhou Jin's full house—both crushed by Guan Yu's superior hand.

The crowd gaped. Zhou Jin's pupils dilated in disbelief before realization struck—Guan Yu hadn't bluffed his cards, but bluffed the players themselves.

The epiphany left Zhou Jin dazed. Rather than deceiving everyone, Guan Yu had specifically manipulated him into escalating the bets.

Understanding this, Zhou Jin's eyes flickered with newfound wariness.

"Lost? Impossible! You cheated!" Fatty Ma roared, jabbing a finger at Guan Yu.

Guan Yu sneered. "Everyone here knows I didn't cheat. Can't handle loss? Don't disgrace yourself at the tables."

"I demand your hands severed per casino rules!" Fatty Ma barked at his bodyguards. "Do it!"

The guards lunged. Guan Yu's eyes hardened. As one kicked toward him, his lightning-fast hand caught the ankle. Activating his gravity system, he swung the man into his partner's punch—

Crack!

Ankle bones snapped as fist met shin. The second guard recoiled, but Guan Yu's left hand already gripped his arm—

Snap!

The arm deformed before Guan Yu's kicks sent both men flying. In a blur, he stood before Fatty Ma.

The obese man barely registered the movement before Guan Yu's fist buried itself in his gut. Fatty Ma collapsed, wheezing, eyes bloodshot.

From takedowns to Fatty Ma's kneeling, mere seconds had passed.

"So fast... so strong," Zhou Jin murmured, awed.

Behind them, Niu Le whipped out his trusty machete. "F***ing pig! I'll carve you!"

Guan Yu intercepted the swing. "Enough."

He shook his head. After Park Xu's incident, he needed to curb Niu Le's blade-happy impulses.

Niu Le spat on the groaning Fatty Ma. "Lucky bastard. Next time, I'll skin you."

Turning to Chu Hong, Guan Yu smiled. "Apologies for the mess. Let me know if this causes trouble. I'll handle any... lingering issues."

Chu Hong seethed inwardly. The brat was dragging her casino into his feud.

If she acknowledged trouble, he'd "resolve" it—meaning she'd inherit Fatty Ma's wrath. Denying problems would slight the powerful magnate. Trapped, she forced a laugh.

"Little brother," she purred, "no one causes trouble here. Don't worry your handsome head."

Guan Yu's smile widened. "I never doubted you." He glanced around. "Game's over. Join me for dinner?"

Chu Hong's tinkling laugh filled the room. "Finally showing sister some care?"

Their flirtatious exchange ended the game. Boss Sun stormed out, 100 million lighter and spurned. Fatty Ma staggered up, shooting venomous glares before limping away.

Zhou Jin departed last, having paid 100 million for crucial insights into Guan Yu's tactics.

Alone with Chu Hong, Guan Yu teased, "Staring so long—am I that dashing?"

**Chapter 598: Borrowed Blades (Part 1)**

Who said Guan Yu was just some twenty-year-old punk? The kid was a seasoned fox.

By making her complicit, he'd forced her hand. Yet this might be her chance to deepen their connection—and his eventual downfall.

As Chu Hong wrestled with dilemmas, Guan Yu surveyed the 400 million chips. Niu Le drooled until a flick to his head brought him back.

"Take 100 million for your projects," Guan Yu told Luo Cheng. "Niu Le gets five. The rest goes to me."

After disbursing funds, Guan Yu shooed them away. "Scram. Don't ruin my evening."

Niu Le grinned, giving a thumbs-up. "Don't wear her out, boss!"

Left alone, Guan Yu turned to Chu Hong. "See something you like?"
