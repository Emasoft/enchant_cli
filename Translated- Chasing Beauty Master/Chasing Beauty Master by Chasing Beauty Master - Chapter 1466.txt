The disciples of Tigerhead Peak had all been inspected. Lin Chen’s heart nearly leapt to his throat, but fortunately, he passed safely and finally relaxed. After the inspection, Lin Chen immediately requested permission from Xuanming to leave, citing physical discomfort as his reason.

When Guanyu arrived outside Tigerhead Peak, he saw from afar that the courtyard was brightly illuminated, likely by numerous night pearls, and filled with the clamor of voices.

Quickening his pace, Guanyu reached the main gate of Tigerhead Peak only to find it tightly shut despite the crowd inside. Confused by the situation, he surveyed the area.

After a moment’s consideration, Guanyu realized he could neither use swordflight nor leap over the gate. With no other option, he pounded forcefully on the door.

A while passed with no response—perhaps the chaos inside drowned out the noise. He knocked again, harder this time.

Still ignored, Guanyu resorted to kicking the gate repeatedly, the reverberations echoing loudly. This finally caught the attention of several disciples inside.

Had the noise not been heard, Guanyu would have barged in directly.

A disciple from Bamboo Forest Peak, sharp-eared and quick-witted, rushed to Elder Mu’s side and reported, “Master, someone is pounding on the main gate—quite violently.”

“Oh? Are you certain?” Elder Mu glanced toward the gate, curiosity tingeing his voice.

“Without doubt. The gate itself trembles as if about to collapse. How could I mistake it?” the disciple insisted.

Nodding, Elder Mu approached Xuanming and gestured toward the entrance. “Senior Brother Sect Leader, a disciple reports loud knocking at the gate. Should we investigate? Could it be Yanzao returning?”

“Quickly! Send someone to open it! It must be Yanzao!” Xuanming’s spirits lifted as he ordered Tigerhead Peak disciples to unseal the gate, convinced Yanzao’s return would salvage his dignity, proving the disciple’s loyalty.

Two agile Tigerhead Peak disciples sprinted to the gate. When the heavy doors creaked open, they revealed not Yanzao but Guanyu. The entire courtyard fell silent as all eyes turned to the figure at the threshold, astonishment etched on every face.

No one had anticipated Guanyu’s return at this critical hour—not even Elder Lu. Had he learned of Cloudgreen Sect’s turmoil? Impossible—today’s assembly to root out spies was known only to Xuanming, Elder Lu, and Elder Mu. None would have leaked the information.

Yet here stood Guanyu, seemingly aware of the sect’s crisis. Since Yanzao had earlier shifted all blame onto him, everyone assumed Guanyu would never dare return.

Xuanming rose, a faint smile breaking through his surprise. Guanyu’s return suggested innocence—or at least preparedness to counter accusations. Moreover, his willingness to face judgment proved he hadn’t betrayed the sect—a vital reassurance given Guanyu’s unparalleled importance to Cloudgreen’s future.

Striding confidently into the courtyard under countless gazes, Guanyu approached Xuanming. Passing Elder Xiang, he deliberately shot the man a contemptuous glare, bristling the elder’s hackles with rage.

“Master, my return was delayed for reasons I must explain,” Guanyu declared.

Though disheartened by Yanzao’s desertion, Xuanming welcomed Guanyu’s arrival. Even if grievances existed, they could be aired now. The sect leader had already resolved to nurture this exceptional disciple whose potential could elevate Cloudgreen to new heights—to neglect such talent would be unforgivable.

“First,” Xuanming began, suppressing his relief, “explain why my messengers found no trace of you these past days.”

With the entire assembly present, Xuanming intended for Guanyu to clear his name publicly. He trusted the young man’s shrewdness—Guanyu wouldn’t risk appearing unless prepared.

“Master,” Guanyu launched into fabrication, “I never received your summons. I was ambushed, gravely wounded, and took refuge in a cave. An elderly woman saved me.”

With Yanzao absent and no evidence to contradict him, Guanyu spun his tale freely.

“Ambushed?” Xuanming frowned. “But you escaped Tiger’s Maw Manor unharmed. How were you injured?”

Guanyu measured his response carefully. “Master, may I ask—what mission did Yanzao undertake? On my return journey, he ambushed me with lethal intent. Only swift flight saved my life.”

Xuanming jolted upright. “You encountered Yanzao?”

**Chapter 3822: Great Hope**

Guanyu’s question probed Yanzao’s status. If Xuanming had dispatched him, different tactics would apply. But if the elder had fled exposure as a traitor...

“Indeed. Within Cloudgreen territory, Yanzao emerged from hiding to attack me unprovoked, clearly seeking my death.”

Xuanming’s cheek twitched. This confirmed Yanzao’s betrayal and flight.

The revelation stunned disciples below. Those who revered Yanzao felt icy disillusionment—their role model now branded a traitor. Others feared for Cloudgreen’s stability, while ambitious juniors secretly rejoiced at the rival’s downfall.

Most struggled to reconcile Yanzao—Xuanming’s star disciple of decades—with sudden treachery. Yet some delighted in the comeuppance of his former bullies.

Seated regally, Xuanming addressed Guanyu: “You witness tonight’s gathering. Following Xiao Zhi’s incident, we purge demonic cult spies. Yanzao fled to evade scrutiny.”

Guanyu inwardly smirked. Perfect—Yanzao’s exposure was ideal, though escape rankled. Still, the bullet wound would plague the traitor. Without proper medical care, he’d likely limp forever.

Feigning sorrow, Guanyu growled, “No wonder he attacked! He failed before but overestimated himself this time. Had he not fled, I’d present his head to you.”

Snickers rippled through the crowd. Many deemed this bravado—Yanzao, Cloudgreen’s foremost disciple, outmatched Guanyu utterly. Even with the Imperial Seal’s depleted power, none believed Guanyu could best Xuanming’s protege.

Elder Xiang rose with a derisive snort. “Boy, arrogance invites mockery. Claiming you’d take Yanzao’s head? Absurd! Though proven traitor, your boast reeks of falsehood.”

Leftpeak disciples, long hostile toward Guanyu, jeered:

“If you’re so mighty, explain how you’d defeat him!”

“All bluster! Relying on the Imperial Seal to play hero!”

Guanyu’s eyes narrowed. Time to humble these doubters.

Elder Lu interjected, “Elder Xiang, control your disciples! Your earlier obstruction allowed Yanzao’s escape. Will you never learn?”

**Chapter 3823: Overbearing Arrogance**

Before Elder Xiang could retort, Guanyu taunted, “Elder Xiang, your wounds healed well. Perhaps convalescence left you restless?”

The elder’s face purpled. “Know your place, whelp! Dare you disrespect your superior?”

“Superior?” Guanyu sneered. “A master who breeds such ill-mannered disciples brings shame. Look there—” He pointed at a kneeling disciple, bloodied and disgraced. “Your teachings produce trash. Have you no shame?”

“You overstep!” Elder Xiang trembled with rage. “My disciples’ failings are none of your concern! Cease your slander!”

“Or what?” Guanyu smirked. “Have you forgotten our last encounter?”

Xuanming intervened: “Guanyu, apologize! Elder Xiang is your senior!”

Neither would yield. Guanyu refused to debase himself; Elder Xiang craved vengeance for past humiliation.

“Senior Brother Sect Leader!” The elder pointed accusingly. “You witness his insolence! I shall discipline him!”

“Come then,” Guanyu beckoned. “I await.”

Elder Xiang demanded, “Surrender the Imperial Seal first! Lest its power harm bystanders.”

Guanyu laughed scornfully. “Pathetic—a sect elder fearing a junior’s artifact? To challenge me yet demand disarmament? You disgrace Cloudgreen!”

Amid gasps, Guanyu placed the Imperial Seal on the ground. “Against you, I need no relic. It would be wasteful.”

The crowd buzzed. Without his artifact, even the weakest elder should crush Guanyu. Yet the youth stood defiant as Elder Xiang took position in the courtyard.

Elder Lu warned, “Guanyu! Don’t be rash!”

But the duel was joined—pride against ambition, the sect’s future hanging in the balance.
