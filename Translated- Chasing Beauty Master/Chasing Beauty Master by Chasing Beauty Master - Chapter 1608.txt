“Prince,” Guan Yu began, “I estimate a fifty percent chance that Zou Wuxiao (No Resemblance) has fled. The remaining possibility is that he clings to false hope, intending to return and either feign ignorance of your suspicions or beg for mercy.”

“Let us set aside his affairs for now,” Prince Zou waved a hand. “What of the defensive preparations? Surely no major oversights remain?”

“Your Highness need not worry,” Guan Yu replied. “The mercenaries we hired understand the risks of casualties. They’ve been amply supplied—every resource I could procure is at their disposal. How long they endure depends on the Imperial Guards’ ferocity, but they shall not falter lightly.”

“And our course now? Do we simply wait? The Imperial Guards have surrounded this place with overwhelming numbers. Surely they’ll raze the entire inn?”

“For the moment, yes—we hold our position.” Guan Yu’s voice carried iron conviction. “Even if the heavens collapse outside these walls, we do not stir. The Imperial Guards may be ruthless, but they’ll not waste effort searching every lodging house. Remain calm—we are secure here.”

Prince Zou nodded, his survival now inextricably tied to Guan Yu’s counsel. Nearby, Zou Wuhui (No Regrets) trailed behind Wang Jun as they escorted the prince to his temporary sanctuary—a strategic move orchestrated by Guan Yu. With Zou Wuhui guarding the prince, Guan Yu could confront the Imperial Guards unimpeded.

“Your Highness!” Zou Wuhui exclaimed upon seeing the prince, relief flooding her features as she bowed. “When did you relocate? I’d no notion of—”

“Lao Cang’s design,” the prince interjected. “A scheme serving dual purposes: confounding our pursuers while rooting out traitors in our ranks.”

Zou Wuhui’s expression tightened. Before she could speak, the prince continued, “Should you encounter Wuxiao, bring him to me silently. No questions—we cannot risk alerting our enemies.”

“As you command.” Her obedience was automatic, though confusion churned beneath. How could Zou Wuxiao—raised alongside her in the prince’s household, cherished as blood kin despite their lack of relation—betray their liege? Since childhood, the prince’s manor had been her sanctuary, where Zou Wuxiao and Zou Wuya (since slain) shielded her from all adversity. Now, with Wuya gone, Wuxiao’s alleged treachery struck like a dagger to the heart.

**Chapter 4177: Not a Single One Shall Escape**

Zou Wuhui burned to confront Wuxiao, to demand why he’d allegedly sold their prince to the Imperial Guards. What possible grievance could justify such perfidy?

Guan Yu approached the prince. “Your sanctuary here is secure. The Imperial Guards will soon realize your absence—it’s time I joined the fray. My companions will protect you.”

At the prince’s nod, Guan Yu departed with Wang Xiaorong—the latter insisting on accompanying him despite risks—leaving Wang Jun, Xiao Zhi, and Zou Wuhui behind.

Chaos reigned at the original inn. Imperial Guards ransacked rooms, interrogating patrons only to find their quarry vanished. Hidden in shadows, Zou Wuxiao frowned—how had the prince’s retinue slipped away unnoticed? Had security been lax, allowing escape during the initial commotion?

“You call this intelligence?” The Centurion’s blade hovered at Yan Zhao (Salt Marsh)’s throat as empty courtyards mocked their efforts. “Where is your promised target?”

“The information was sound!” Yan Zhao forced calm, aware of a hundred hostile eyes upon him. “They fled upon sensing your approach—a rat abandoning ship. My informants shall answer for this!”

The Centurion snorted, sheathing his blade. Alliance with this Demon Soul Sect cultivator rankled, but better tentative partnership than open enmity. “To the previous inn!” he barked. “Seal and search it—leave no rat hole unprobed!”

**Chapter 4178: Never Afraid of Trouble**

Ten guards kicked in the inn’s doors, only for the entrance to slam shut behind them. Moments later, corpses rained from upper windows—bodies throttled by rope nooses—crushing unprepared soldiers below.

“Archers!” roared the enraged Centurion. Twenty bowmen nocked arrows as Guan Yu observed from within. “Surrender the prince, or perish beneath our shafts!”

Guan Yu’s laughter rang from the third floor. “Impressive display, Centurion! Shall we negotiate?”

“Only terms I offer are death or treason!” came the retort. “Yield the prince!”

“Your prince isn’t here.” Guan Yu’s tone dripped mock pity. “Did Salt Marsh not mention? The Demon Soul Sect excels at feeding lies to desperate men.”

All eyes turned to Yan Zhao. “Silence their tongues permanently, and no tales spread!” the cultivator spat.

“Bold words for one hiding behind imperial skirts!” Guan Yu countered. “Test our defenses if you dare.”

“Fire!” The Centurion’s hand swept down. Arrows hissed through windows—only to thud harmlessly into rope-net barriers Guan Yu’s men had strung. Collecting the undamaged shafts, the defenders grinned—now armed with ammunition for their bamboo bows.

**Chapter 4179: Storm the Gates**

“Send your puppet mage to flatten the building,” the Centurion sneered as initial volleys proved futile.

Yan Zhao paled. “My arts aren’t suited for... structural demolition.”

“Useless!” The Centurion turned to his troops. “Assault positions! Leave none alive!”

As soldiers advanced, Guan Yu’s voice carried cold promise: “You’ll regret crossing this threshold.” In the shadows, Zou Wuxiao watched—a ghost torn between loyalties.
