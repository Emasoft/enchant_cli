“This!” Guan Yu conjured a bottle of white liquor like a magician. “Grandpa, this is called Mendaolu (Knock Out a Donkey), a specialty from Inner Mongolia. It burns like a knife scraping your heart—utterly exhilarating! Try it!”

Seeing the liquor, Hu Zongze remarked coolly, “I’ve heard the elder’s health is delicate. Such strong liquor seems unwise.”

**Chapter 974: Making Someone Faint Out of Anger**

Wen Baoguo frowned. “Father, perhaps you should drink something milder?”

“What? Milder drinks? I’m no delicate woman!” Wen Shuquan glared, displeased.

“Grandpa, don’t look down on women!” Wen Qing pouted. “I can drink too!”

Liu Yunshu scolded, “Qing’er! Mind your words!”

“Hmph! Grandpa started it by belittling women!”

“Alright, alright! This old man apologizes!” Wen Shuquan chuckled indulgently. “My granddaughter rivals any man! Forgive this foolish grandfather?”

Wen Qing brightened. “That’s better!” She stealthily poured herself a cup and gulped it down.

“Cough! So spicy!”

“Foolish girl! Drink water!” Liu Yunshu fretted, hastily offering a glass.

Wen Baoguo shot Guan Yu a venomous look. Clearly, his daughter needed distancing from this troublemaker—already learning to drink!

Noticing his future father-in-law’s glare, Guan Yu rolled his eyes. What’s that got to do with me?

“Come, Xiaoyu! Clink glasses with Grandpa!” The elder downed half a cup in one go, smacking his lips. “Excellent! Real fire in the belly!”

“Exactly, Grandpa! Real men drink liquor! Unlike Father-in-law here…” Guan Yu’s jab nearly made Wen Baoguo’s lungs explode with rage. Even Hu Zongze’s face darkened—one sentence insulting both men.

Unfazed by their glares, Guan Yu cheerfully refilled their cups. “True men drink without fuss! Bottoms up!”

“Fine!” Wen Baoguo drained his cup.

“Father-in-law! Such capacity—a real man!” Guan Yu fawned.

“Obviously!” Wen Baoguo preened at the flattery.

“Brother Hu? Not drinking? Think my liquor inferior?” Guan Yu prodded.

Hu Zongze’s gaze turned venomous. Accustomed to European nobility and fine wines during his years abroad, he considered white liquor barbaric. Moreover, Guan Yu had poured him three ounces—enough to fell an ox.

Yet with Wen Baoguo having drunk, refusal would seem cowardly. Gritting his teeth, Hu Zongze declared, “I’ll drink!”

The first sip triggered violent coughing. Guan Yu clucked faux-concernedly, patting his back. “Brother Hu! Need water? Qing’er, fetch some!”

“Unnecessary!” Hu Zongze shook him off, forcing the entire cup down.

“Marvelous! Another!” Guan Yu refilled it.

Hu Zongze longed to slap that smirking face. Three consecutive cups? Clearly deliberate! Yet to save face before Wen Shuquan, he choked down the second.

“They say three cups upon entry—the third must be drunk!”

“Agreed!” Hu Zongze ground out.

Now crimson and swaying, Hu Zongze was clearly done. Undeterred, Guan Yu raised his own cup. “As Qing’s husband and your junior, I should toast you as elder brother!”

Though suspecting mockery, Hu Zongze’s fogged mind accepted. As he neared the final sip, his stomach rebelled—he spewed violently.

The aptly named Knock Out a Donkey (65% alcohol) lived up to its name. Four cups was impressive, but vomiting at the table? Disgraceful.

“What waste!” Guan Yu lamented. “Teachers taught us to cherish grain! Though liquor isn’t grain, it’s brewed from sorghum! Shameful waste, Brother Hu!”

Already queasy, Hu Zongze’s eyes rolled back—he fainted.

“Pathetic.” Guan Yu sneered. “Can’t even handle banter?”

“Guan Yu! Too far!” Wen Baoguo thundered.

“Father-in-law! I merely offered drinks! His weak constitution isn’t my fault! What man faints from three cups? Right, Grandpa?”

Wen Shuquan nodded. “True! In my youth, I downed two bottles of firewater! Zongze’s limits aren’t Xiaoyu’s fault.”

“Father! Why always take his side?!”

“He’s my granddaughter’s chosen! Should I favor outsiders? Qing’er’s happiness matters most!”

Though valuing status, Wen Shuquan prioritized his granddaughter’s joy. Even a pauper could become emperor if she loved him.

Wen Baoguo relented. “Fine. Let Zongze stay overnight.”

“Nonsense! His home’s nearby. Call his family!”

**Chapter 975: The Wen Family’s Future Heir**

The tense dinner concluded. Granted permission to stay, Guan Yu tried sneaking off with Wen Qing, but Wen Shuquan summoned him to the study.

The elder’s demeanor had shifted—no longer the genial grandfather, but a formidable general. “Sit. Drink?” He poured Mendaolu.

Declining, Guan Yu waited.

“Xiaoyu, we’ve monitored you since you courted Qing’er. As a soldier, I’d never permit her to wed someone like you—yet here you stand. Know why?”

“No.” Guan Yu admitted. His humble origins puzzled him—why would a military titan accept him?

“You mirror my youth.” Wen Shuquan smiled. Both rose from nothing through grit and luck. “But true strength lies in remaining grounded despite success. Baoguo lacks this—hence his resentment. Also… you stole his precious daughter.”

“I truly love Qing’er. I’ll cherish her forever!”

“I believe you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here.” The elder’s eyes narrowed. “Though your harem makes me want to thrash you! Were it not for Qing’er’s wishes…”

Guan Yu shifted awkwardly.

Waving this aside, Wen Shuquan continued, “Youth has its ways. Even Old Li’s granddaughter fell for you—he’ll be livid! Less tolerant than I, that one. Brace yourself!”

Referring to Li Xi’s grandfather, another retired general.

“As for Hu Zongze’s grandfather—a vindictive old coot. But he won’t lower himself to trouble you while I live. I’m aging, Xiaoyu. Baoguo’s limited. The Wen family… will rely on you.”

“Grandpa! You’ll live twenty more years!”

Wen Shuquan laughed. “Five would suffice!”

Entering abruptly, Wen Baoguo demanded, “What’s this about five years?”

“Zongze gone?”

“Left. He’ll sleep it off.” He glared at Guan Yu.

“Why obsess over Hu’s boy? Xiaoyu is Qing’er’s choice—and our heir!”

“Father! I promised his father a marriage pact!”

“Foolishness! Qing’er’s wishes override ancient jokes!”

“My concern for Qing’er is why I tolerate this rascal!” Wen Baoguo pointed accusingly.

“You couldn’t stop them anyway!” Guan Yu muttered.

“What?!”

“Nothing! Merely inquiring—trouble sleeping? Need… assistance?” Guan Yu smirked suggestively.

Blushing, Wen Baoguo stormed out as Guan Yu’s phone rang—Jiang Ziqi.

“Guan Shao! The club matter’s resolved.” Uncharacteristically polite.

“Well done.” Guan Yu approved.

“There’s a后天night party at Xinyuan Club. Interested?”

“No.”

Hanging up, Guan Yu reconsidered—Hu Zongze mentioned a后天event. Calling back: “That party—organized by Hu Zongze?”

“How’d you know?”

“I’ll attend.”

As he hung up, both Wens stared intensely.

“You’re… acquainted with the Jiang heir?”

**Chapter 976: Missing That Banana**

Jiang Ziqi’s forced allegiance had been resentful. This sudden deference puzzled Guan Yu. At the party confirmation, he’d attend—and confront Hu Zongze.

Meanwhile, the Wen patriarchs assessed their unconventional heir, equal parts exasperated and impressed. The family’s future balance now rested on this roguish young man’s shoulders.
