Hearing Amy's words, Guanyu suddenly felt embarrassed. It was his negligence that had allowed Locke to escape. Now faced with Amy's question, he truly didn't know how to explain it to her.

Patriarch Allen, noticing Guanyu's discomfort, quickly intervened to save face. "Amy, you've just awakened. Don't dwell on unpleasant matters. Later, I'll prepare more restorative elixirs for you to recuperate properly!"

"That's right, Amy," Guanyu added. "Don't think about anything now. When I return, I'll bring you many wonderful things!"

"Return? What do you mean? Brother Dragon Clan, where are you going?"

Only then did Guanyu realize he hadn't told Amy about his impending departure. Given Amy's previous dependence on him, she would likely insist on following if he left.

As predicted, when Amy saw Guanyu's prolonged silence, she grew anxious and turned to her father. "Father, is Brother Dragon Clan leaving our Elven Forest?"

Patriarch Allen also realized the situation but struggled to explain. Since Guanyu's arrival, Amy had become more vivacious and cheerful, smiling far more than in the years after her mother's departure. Now that the elven affairs were resolved, a prodigy like Guanyu was destined for greater exploits across the continent—he couldn't remain confined to their forest. Thus emerged the inevitable conflict: Guanyu's departure would break his precious daughter's heart.

Previously, Guanyu might have taken Amy adventuring, but her recent recovery made this impossible. To persuade her, Guanyu decided to fabricate a tale. "Amy, you've always called me 'Brother Dragon Clan.' Since I belong to the Dragon Clan, I must return home."

"I know! Brother Dragon Clan's home is Dragon Valley!"

As an otherworldly human, Guanyu knew nothing of Dragon Valley but feigned familiarity. "Exactly! Dragon Valley is beautiful, with friendly dragonfolk. When you recover fully, I'll take you there!"

"Really? Wonderful! I'm already better! Take me now!"

Guanyu sighed helplessly while Patriarch Allen chuckled wryly. "Stubborn girl! This time I won't indulge you. How can you think of playing in this condition?"

Suddenly, Shituo entered, commenting on their discussion. "What spell has this rascal Guanyu cast to enchant both Amy and Roxie?"

Guanyu shrugged innocently. "I've done nothing. Don't worry—if I take them to Dragon Valley, it'll only be after full recovery."

"But..."

"Enough 'buts'! If you don't heal properly, we'll all worry. Do you want everyone upset because of you?"

Though reluctant, Amy stayed silent, unwilling to trouble Guanyu or her father. The group then left to let her rest, while Guanyu prepared to depart the Elven Forest for the wider world.

Returning to his room, Guanyu collapsed wearily onto his bed, exhausted from Soul-Devouring Powder's effects.

"Boss! Boss! Wake up!"

A low voice roused Guanyu from deep slumber. Blinking drowsily, he felt something furry brushing his face. Snatching the creature, he tossed it aside. "What is it? Can't you see I'm sleeping?"

The Bikacat—whose power rivaled Sword Kings—leapt back nonchalantly. "Boss, a beauty's running this way!"

"Beauty?" Guanyu's eyes lit up. Dressing hastily, he peered outside to see Shaosiming approaching.

Clad in ethereal purple gauze, Shaosiming floated gracefully as always, radiating celestial charm.

"Master Guanyu! Are you inside?" she called softly before reaching his door.

Guanyu decided to tease her. Pretending sleep, he remained silent until she entered. "Still asleep? Such a lazybones!"

"Who are you calling lazybones?"

The voice startled Shaosiming—it didn't come from Guanyu.

...

...

Chapter 1365: My Name Is Husband

The voice hadn't been Guanyu's!

Shaosiming paled, scanning the room. "Has an intruder entered? Why wasn't he detected earlier?"

Sensing spiritual fluctuations, she detected another presence matching Guanyu's formidable aura.

"Show yourself! No more tricks!"

Rustling sounded behind her. Whirling around, she faced a tall figure.

"Ah!" Shaosiming screamed before recognizing Guanyu. Angrily, she swatted his shoulder. "You frightened me! Weren't you just asleep? What's this mischief?"

"Where's the surprise without mystery?" Guanyu replied tenderly, eyes glinting.

"Since when such sweet talk? How's your Soul-Devouring Powder injury?" Examining his hand, she tutted. "Quite severe, but your thick hide will heal soon."

"Cough... Did you come to visit or mock me?"

"What do you think?" Her coy smile faded. "Earlier, I heard a strange voice here—from a peerless expert!"

Guanyu knew Bikacat's antics but played along. "Really? Could they match your 'Husband'?"

"Husband? What's that?"

"Ahem... 'Husband' isn't a thing—it's my title. When I roamed the martial world, this name struck fear into hearts, making foes surrender without battle!"

Shaosiming eyed him skeptically. Unlike naive Amy or infatuated Roxie, she remained clear-headed. "Truly? Or your own fabrication?"

"Would I lie? Granted by fellow warriors—mere vanity titles I disregard."

"But... I've never heard experts called 'Husband.'"

Captivated by her beauty—unsurpassed among women he'd known—Guanyu pressed on. "Doubt me? Let me demonstrate! You mentioned that expert—I'll subdue him!"

Shaosiming gaped. Though unseen, she'd sensed the intruder's power rivaled Guanyu's.

Seizing her astonishment, Guanyu launched his courtship scheme. Whispering instructions to Bikacat, he declared, "I'll summon my title. If he remains, he'll cower!"

"What if he fled from fear?"

Guanyu sighed dramatically. "Still distrust your Husband? Sense if he remains. If he dares flee, I'll end him!"

Intimidated despite her decade as Elven Lawkeeper—equivalent to human justice elders—Shaosiming obeyed like a girl. After concentrating, she nodded. "He's still here."

Guanyu smiled, mentally warning Bikacat: *This wildcat better not ruin my act!* The feline cooperated, revealing just enough aura.

"Confirm he's powerful?" Guanyu continued. At her nod, he added, "His strength equals Sword Kings—a Magister-level mage!"

Though expecting greatness, Shaosiming hadn't imagined such might. "Would he have spared me due to you?"

"Now witness your Husband's power!" Guanyu roared suddenly: "Demon! Surrender or face annihilation!"

Silence ensued. Just as Shaosiming doubted, an ethereal voice quavered: "Husband! Spare me!"

Chapter 1366: Nami

Shaosiming jumped. Though evidence mounted, confusion remained. "Master Guanyu, was that truly...?"

Guanyu feigned hurt. "Still distrustful? And why still 'Master Guanyu'?"

"What else should I call you?"

"Didn't you hear? 'Husband'!"

"But... it sounds odd."

"Titles often do. Let me discipline that intruder again!"

Guanyu shouted authoritatively: "Demon! Leave without frightening my friend!"

The voice trembled: "Forgive me, Husband! I'll depart!"

Even Guanyu marveled at Bikacat's performance. Shaosiming stared dumbfounded—the mighty expert had become a cowering weakling.

"Hu-Husband," she ventured shyly, "could you make him appear?"

Guanyu panicked internally. "He dares not show himself. Next time, I'll capture him!"

Before Shaosiming could question further, Roxie's voice interrupted: "Master Guanyu?"

Both turned to see Roxie enter, freezing at the sight of Shaosiming. The girls' locked gaze created tension even Guanyu couldn't describe.

"Perhaps... you called too softly?" Guanyu offered weakly.
