Long ago, there came a day when the man’s heart suddenly changed. He became enamored with a princess in the imperial palace. Initially, the woman knew nothing of this. To pursue the royal princess, the man began studying diligently, aiming to pass the imperial examinations and become the top scholar. His goal was to gain proximity to the princess and declare his love.

Years later, driven by ambition, the man indeed became the top scholar and was personally received by the Emperor. From that day onward, he never returned to his wife.

When the woman learned of her husband’s betrayal, her heart refused to yield. Every day, she climbed Mandarin Duck Mountain to gaze at the distant palace, hoping for even a glimpse of her man.

Yet the mountain’s vantage point remained too far. Even if she spotted figures, she could never discern their identities. Still, she never abandoned hope, convinced her husband would eventually return.

Decades passed. The woman grew old, her strength waning until she could no longer climb. In her final moments, she mustered her last energy to ascend the summit. Peering down at the palace, she suddenly seemed to see her husband’s figure.

There she sat, breathing her last. Her body petrified into a stone statue that remains perched on the mountaintop to this day, its eyes eternally fixed on the palace—a testament to her undying devotion.

Upon learning her tale, people named the mountain "Mandarin Duck Mountain." The woman’s stone effigy was enshrined as an immortal.

Legends say that when the dead turn to stone, their souls ascend as living deities while their bodies petrify.

Over time, young maidens yearning for love and their idealized princes began pilgrimages to the mountain, venerating the "Great Immortal of Mandarin Ducks." Many prayed to find true love or ensure their husbands’ fidelity.

Thus, the site became sacred to lovelorn maidens. In an era where marriages were arranged and women’s status low, this mountain symbolized their deepest hopes. Even matchmakers visited, seeking auspicious unions—a practice especially cherished by common families, whose marital freedoms outweighed those of nobles and officials.

**Chapter 4295: Truly Beautiful**

Guanyu suggested, “Let’s go up the mountain and take a look? We’ve nothing better to do anyway.”

Qiqi eagerly agreed, imagining the summit’s delights. Unlike Wang Xiaorong—who preferred staying home with good food—Qiqi disliked overeating. Whether from lifelong habit or newfound vanity about her figure, she strictly controlled her diet. Restless by nature, she thrived on outdoor adventures.

Leading the way, Qiqi marched ahead while Guanyu and Wang Xiaorong followed. Dressed as an older couple, they appeared like parents escorting their child.

Suddenly, Qiqi turned and asked, “Handsome Master, why didn’t you admit who you were when the Crown Prince asked today? Becoming friends with someone so important—isn’t that a good thing?”

Earlier, entering the Crown Prince’s estate had thrilled Qiqi. The sprawling mansion fascinated her, its novelties etched in memory to later regale her grandfather.

At the summit, Guanyu spotted an aged yet majestic pavilion. Believing the legendary stone immortal resided inside, he stood at the entrance and gazed out. “Truly beautiful.”

His first impression: the glittering panorama below revealed most of the vast palace complex, teeming with activity. Though distant, the layout was discernible. “A telescope would help,” he mused.

Wang Xiaorong said, “I want to light incense and pray to the Great Immortal.” Whether genuine or not, she saw no harm in trying.

Guanyu declined. “You two go. I’ll stay here and enjoy the view.”

From this height, the bustling capital unfolded—crowded streets, distant palace sentries stationed every few meters. Mandarin Duck Mountain’s vantage faced the palace’s flank, offering sweeping visibility.

“Excuse me?” A voice interrupted. Behind Guanyu stood a disabled woman in her thirties, leaning on a crutch. Her right leg was severed at the knee.

Guanyu stepped aside. The woman thanked him as she passed. Watching her struggle, he wondered why she’d undertake such a grueling pilgrimage.

Fireworks suddenly lit the palace sky—vibrant hues honoring Prince Zou’s arrival. Guanyu guessed the Emperor hosted a grand banquet.

Meanwhile, Second Prince raged in his chambers. Prime Minister Li, Seventh Minister, and the injured Bloodhunt Sect Elder attended his tirade.

“Useless!” The prince roared. “I’ve given you silver, women, men—yet you fail to kill Prince Zou? Even you returned half-dead! Spare me your lies!”

The Elder countered, “Prince Zou’s entourage includes a hidden weapons master. My disciple died instantly—I barely escaped. My shoulder wound resists healing. I must retreat to meditate.”

“Disappear then,” the prince sneered. “Your sect’s exposed. Don’t resurface without my call.”

As the Elder departed, news spread: Prince Zou’s arrival had stirred the court. The Emperor hosted a lavish banquet, pointedly ignoring the assassination attempts.

Prince Zou chose to reside with First Prince, a strategic move the Emperor approved. With Second Prince’s faction overpowering, the Emperor welcomed this balance.

Next noon, First Prince hosted Prince Zou with operatic performances. “Your Highness honors me,” Prince Zou said graciously.

“The honor is mine,” First Prince replied. “Had Father not summoned you, I’d have sought you sooner. Your fame reached me in childhood.”

Their private discussion focused on consolidating power before First Prince’s imminent departure to Hanbei. Though Guanyu’s group paid respects, they soon excused themselves.

Prince Zou’s ambitions had shifted. Once content as the Emperor’s pawn, near-death journeys hardened him. Now, he eyed the throne—believing neither prince worthy.

**Chapter 4298: Heart-to-Heart**

During his audience, the Emperor feigned warmth, ignoring Prince Zou’s ordeals. This indifference cemented Prince Zou’s resolve: only the crown could compensate his suffering.

First Prince, tutored by strategists, now grasped power’s importance. Allying with Prince Zou bolstered his confidence.

Yet Prince Zou saw deeper. Surviving assassination plots revealed his indispensability. Each brush with death fueled his determination. Arriving in the capital, he vowed: “I’ll claim what’s owed—for myself and the fallen.”

The Emperor’s silence spoke volumes. To him, Prince Zou was a tool—discarded if broken. This realization ignited a fire. After weathering storms, Prince Zou would either seize destiny or die trying.
