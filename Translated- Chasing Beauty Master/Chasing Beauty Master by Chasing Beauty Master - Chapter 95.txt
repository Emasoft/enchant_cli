“These two delicate petals, tender and pink, with sparse, curly strands, are so beautiful… A world apart from the female leads in those adult films I’ve watched online. This… is immaculately pristine, not a single trace of disorder. The sight before me resembles a flawless masterpiece from an artist’s brush—utterly perfect, breathtakingly beautiful enough to make one’s heart tremble.

This… is the place that haunts men’s dreams! To share…

Chapter 230: Meeting the Future Father-in-Law

Early the next morning, Guan Yu held the nearly naked Du Xiaojuan in his arms, his face haggard with emotional exhaustion.

The night’s activities had been too intense! Though they hadn’t crossed the final threshold, the little minx’s mouth and hands were utterly soul-stealing, keeping Guan Yu awake until past 2 AM. Had it not been for his iron willpower, they might have broken through that final barrier during their second encounter.

Upon waking, Du Xiaojuan gave Guan Yu a sweet smile before wrapping herself in the blanket to dress. How ironic—after baring everything last night, daylight now made her shy.

Niu Le stayed in the downstairs room. After all three freshened up, they went outside the villa compound to a breakfast shop.

“Call your parents later,” Guan Yu said softly between sips of congee. “Arrange for us to meet them over a meal.”

“Maybe… we should wait a few days? My aunt promised not to tell them yet,” Du Xiaojuan whispered, eyes downcast with apprehension.

Contacting her family meant risking forced return to Beijing if Guan Yu failed to resolve things. She might never see him freely again.

These days with Guan Yu had brought unprecedented peace and joy. If her parents insisted on transferring schools and separating them, Du Xiaojuan feared she might lose her mind—succumbing to lovesickness or depression.

The mere thought of parting stabbed her heart like twisting knives.

“Trust me,” Guan Yu said with an arched brow. “Everything will be fine. Don’t you believe in my capabilities?” He perfectly understood her hidden anxieties.

“Oh…” The girl stared at him with wide eyes before nodding obediently and resuming her meal.

Back at the villa, Du Xiaojuan hesitated with the phone. “Must we call now?”

“Absolutely.” Guan Yu lounged with crossed legs, cigarette dangling from his lips.

Seeing him light up, Du Xiaojuan hastily retrieved a lighter from under the coffee table. With a click, she offered the flame while pleading, “Can’t we wait a few days?”

“Now,” Guan Yu insisted after a deep drag, his gaze unwavering.

“Fine!” Pouting, she made the call.

In a Beijing courtyard house…

“What? Xiaojuan called?” Mrs. Du dropped her embroidery hoop. “She wants to bring that hoodlum here? Where?”

Du Xueheng frowned. Though his twenty-one-year-old daughter dating was normal, her choice of a penniless delinquent galled him. After days living together, he knew what must have occurred.

But accepting marriage because they’d slept together? Impossible!

Moreover, he’d personally promised to introduce his daughter to Guan Yu. Now…

Remembering Guan Yu, Du Xueheng sighed. After Myanmar, the young man had pledged to help with jade gambling ventures. But since that dinner with Li Yunshan, no further word came. Too embarrassed to press, Du could only wait.

Worse, after resolving the red jadeite issue, Guan Yu had flown from Yunnan without leaving contact details. Were those drunken promises empty?

Amidst financial ruin and these troubles, his daughter now wanted to present this ruffian? Du’s disgust mounted.

“Book flights to Nanjing immediately! We’ll bring her back and cut off contact with that… that bastard!”

“Don’t let that scoundrel off easy,” Mrs. Du snapped. “Bring Uncle Deng and Xiao Li—teach him a lesson!”

Unaware of these plans, Du Xiaojuan hung up pouting. “Father… scolded me.”

Guan Yu pulled her onto his lap. “After meeting me, he’ll praise your choice.”

“Stop joking!” She elbowed him, disbelieving.

“Evening meeting arranged?”

“Father wants us at Aunt’s place. He’s… not in dining mood.”

“Same difference. Let’s shop—need proper attire to impress my future father-in-law.”

“Who’s yours?” she protested, cheeks flushing as she tacitly accepted.

Chapter 231: Attacking My Big Brother?

After futile shopping where Du Xiaojuan adored every outfit Guan tried (“lover’s bias”), he settled on sportswear. A salon visit later, the trio wandered streets until Du Xueheng called.

“They want us now.”

As Guan hailed a taxi, Luo Cheng called: “Yu哥! Where are you? Want to celebrate our shops’ completion!”

After arranging pickup, Luo arrived in the won Land Rover.

“Where to, Yu哥?” Luo asked obsequiously after opening doors.

“Cut the act,” Guan laughed.

En route to Du’s aunt’s compound, Du Xiaojuan spotted two figures at the entrance—an elderly man and pockmarked youth.

“Why’s Father bringing them?” she wondered. “Uncle Deng, our longtime family steward, and Xiao Li, his ex-military driver. Father never travels with them!”

As they exited, the steward blocked Du Xiaojuan’s path. “Young Miss, go upstairs. We’ll handle this.”

“Handle what?” she protested as both men advanced on Guan Yu.

Niu Le and Luo Cheng immediately flanked Guan.

“Come quietly,” Uncle Deng sneered, gesturing to a black sedan.

“After the meeting,” Guan countered.

The pockmarked youth lunged. Niu Le charged like a bull, absorbing a neck chop to tackle his opponent. As the man staggered, Luo Cheng sprinted-kicked his face, then pinned him down, pounding his head against concrete while Niu Le kicked ribs.

“Dare touch our big brother?” they roared.

Chapter 232: Shooting a Movie?

The ex-soldier lay dazed under the pummeling—street brawlers defeating military training through brute force. Guan watched coldly as his men administered the beating.
