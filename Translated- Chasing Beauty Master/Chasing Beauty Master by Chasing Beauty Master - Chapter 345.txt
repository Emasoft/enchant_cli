“You’re crawling away on your own, or should I make you crawl?”

Wu Shungang finally realized why those words sounded so familiar—they were his own, spat out verbatim and now thrown back in his face.

Coincidence? Perhaps. But for a man of Wu’s pride, such humiliation was intolerable. His face darkened as he growled, “What if I refuse both options?”

A sinister smirk crept across Guanyu’s lips. “Then I’ll choose for you.” He advanced slowly, eyes sharp, radiating danger.

Wu’s bravado wavered. This stranger might lack the status to challenge him, but Guanyu’s martial prowess was undeniable. In two swift steps, Guanyu seized Wu’s collar and hoisted him effortlessly, gravity systems humming. Wu’s feet left the deck, dangling over the waterway. One slip, and he’d plunge.

Choking, Wu clawed futilely at the iron grip. Guanyu’s laughter chilled the air. “I forgot to mention—there’s a third option: I choose for you. It’ll be...messier.”

“Y-you...” Wu rasped, rage choking him more than the hand.

“Guanyu, be reasonable!” Wang Siyu intervened. “Violence solves nothing!”

“You forfeited your right to speak,” Guanyu spat, turning his wrath toward her. Her earlier silence during Wang Zhen’s beating stung worse than Wu’s arrogance.

With a brutal knee strike, Guanyu sent Wu overboard. The splash echoed as Wu thrashed, broken and sputtering.

“Enough!” A sharp female voice cut through—Wenya.

Guanyu froze. The voice was achingly familiar.

Wenya stood beside a stranger, a man whose presence ignited Guanyu’s fury. “Let him go. He’s my friend.”

“Your friend?” Guanyu’s laugh was brittle. Disillusionment curdled his heart. Wenya’s cold defense of another man crystallized his betrayal.

Wu’s agonized wails faded as Guanyu turned away, shoulders slumped. “Let’s go,” he muttered to Wang Zhen and Niu Le.

The night’s final insult came in a bar’s strobe-lit chaos. As Wenya navigated the crowd, a greasy hand reached for her. Qin Tian intercepted it, his grip iron. “Touch her,” he warned the leering thug, “and you’ll crawl out of here broken.”

The thug sneered. Qin Tian’s eyes narrowed. Violence hung thick, unspoken.
