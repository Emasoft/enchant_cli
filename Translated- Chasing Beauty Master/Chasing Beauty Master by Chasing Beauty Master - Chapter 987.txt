Fang Ding seethed with resentment inwardly. “Guan Yu is simply inhuman. All this time in the dead of night, he was just toying with her. Had I known there was such an expert among their ranks, I would never have been so arrogant. Why did I have to end up in this wretched state?”

Chen Yaofei and Fang Ding were outstanding talents among the younger generation. Given their extraordinary backgrounds, it was natural for them to carry an air of domineering pride. But today, they had misapplied that arrogance.

Originally, they had thought two Second-Class Zun cultivators could dominate this insignificant place. Yet they were instantly crushed. A Second-Class Zun expert being kicked flying—what did that signify? How high must their opponent’s cultivation be? Fang Ding dared not even imagine.

Turning around and seeing Fang Ding’s current state, Guan Yu smiled faintly. “Aiyo, how could you treat Miss Fang so disrespectfully? Help her up at once.”

These words nearly made Fang Ding vomit blood. She glared at Guan Yu with murderous intent.

Xue Jing waved her gun before holstering it, barking sharply, “Didn’t you hear him? Get up! You’d better check on your dear Senior Brother Chen’s condition. Since you brought him here, you’ll be implicated if anything happens to him.”

Fang Ding felt utterly humiliated, her shame so profound she wished for death. Never in her life had she suffered such indignity.

In this state, how could she care about Chen Yaofei? Her lower abdomen still throbbed from Xue Jing’s kick. Slowly rising, she limped to Chen Yaofei’s side.

By now, Chen Yaofei had been helped up by two subordinates. Though battered, as a Second-Class Zun cultivator, Jones’ powerful kick had mainly caused superficial wounds. His internal organs remained intact, and with some recuperation, he would recover.

After glancing at Chen Yaofei, Fang Ding wordlessly turned to leave. She couldn’t bear staying another second here. Resolving never to see Guan Yu again, she moved toward the exit.

Suddenly, the roar of car engines echoed from the distance—a substantial convoy. Guan Yu glanced questioningly at Jones, assuming she had called reinforcements.

But Jones shook her head. She hadn’t summoned help, having rushed over immediately after a brief notification.

As Fang Ding reached her car, a massive fleet arrived—forty to fifty vehicles of every type flooding the warehouse’s open grounds. Guan Yu sighed. “Seems tonight truly is sleepless.”

He secretly admired Fang Ding’s influence. To mobilize such forces so quickly, despite their ulterior motives, demonstrated formidable power.

Headlights dimmed as three to four people emerged from each vehicle. Even Jones frowned at the sight—over a hundred people now crowded the grounds, nearly half being cultivators of varying levels. Without Jones’ help, Guan Yu knew even his entire Yu Gang present would suffer heavy losses against this force.

The Yu Gang members swallowed nervously. Combined with Chen Yaofei’s men, their opponents numbered nearly two hundred. If this tide surged forward, resistance would be impossible. All eyes turned to Guan Yu, hoping their leader had a plan.

Fang Ding paid little mind. Her psychological wounds overshadowed everything—tonight’s events would haunt her forever. She only wanted to go home.

But the arriving vehicles blocked her path. Initially suspecting Guan Yu’s doing, she then recognized familiar figures—including her so-called “Brother Wolf,” known to others as Lao Lang (Old Wolf).

Lao Lang, a burly thirty-five-year-old tyrant, stood average in height but towered in cruelty. Ruthless and cunning, he cultivated connections with the useful while ignoring others. A Second-Class Zun expert, he enjoyed renown in martial circles, often “studying” techniques from declining sects through gifts and theft.

Though maintaining a low profile, his reputation and strength commanded fear. When his dream girl Fang Ding requested aid, he mobilized contacts through favors and threats, amassing this horde.

“Brother Wolf?” Fang Ding listlessly greeted.

“Little Fang, what happened?” Lao Lang’s uncharacteristically gentle tone made nearby associates shudder.

Most girls would weep when wronged, but Fang Ding straightened, her haughty demeanor resurfacing. Seeing the encircling crowd, she thought viciously, “Guan Yu, can even this army not subdue you? You won’t see tomorrow’s sun!”

Humiliation burned into murderous intent. With Fang family wealth and these forces, killing Guan Yu would carry no consequences.

Noticing Fang Ding’s disheveled state, Lao Lang boasted, “Who dared mistreat you? With this army, we’ll crush them!”

Feigning vulnerability, Fang Ding accused, “It’s Guan Yu inside...he tried to take advantage of me...”

Lao Lang erupted. “Friends! Let’s gut that bastard!”

As the mob surged in, Fang Ding pointed out Guan Yu. “That’s him!”

“Miss Fang,” Guan Yu interjected coolly, “You’ve been summoning forces all night. Now you claim I’m the aggressor?”

“Enough!” Lao Lang brandished his spiked club. “She says you’re guilty—that’s enough! Tonight, your head answers!”

“Moron,” Guan Yu sneered.

The insult stunned Lao Lang. Chuckling nervously, he turned to his men. “Hear that? The pup barks!”

A companion scoffed, “Old Wolf, you gathered us to fight schoolchildren? This is embarrassing.”

Murmurs spread through the crowd—many were reluctant recruits through social debts. Confronting students tarnished their reputations.

Fang Ding urgently clarified, “They have real experts! That woman,” she pointed at Xue Jing, “defeated me in five moves. Senior Brother Chen was knocked out instantly.”

Skeptical glances turned to the unconscious Chen Yaofei. Lao Lang studied Xue Jing—no detectable qi, yet allegedly overpowering Second-Class Zuns. The crowd wavered between doubt and wariness.

Fang Ding pressed, “Check Senior Brother’s condition yourselves! Would I lie about this?”

As attention shifted to Chen Yaofei’s battered form, tension crackled. Lao Lang hefted his club. “Whether true or not, tonight ends here!”

The standoff intensified, a powder keg awaiting ignition.
