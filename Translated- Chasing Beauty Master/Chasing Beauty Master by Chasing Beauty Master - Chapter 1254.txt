Lin Chen was a senior disciple of Tigerhead Peak and could be considered the elder brother among the Yunqing Sect disciples. Not only had he been at the sect for a long time, but his seniority also perfectly met the requirements for participation in the Six Peaks Tournament.

Xuanming intended for Lin Chen to compete, confident that his cultivation level would secure a spot in the top four. This way, Xuanming could avoid parting with another magical artifact. After all, as Lin Chen’s master, canceling his disciple’s reward would raise no objections—even Lin Chen himself wouldn’t dare complain.

“That settles it. Do your best when the time comes, and don’t overthink it,” Xuanming said, patting Guanyu’s shoulder.

Guanyu thought to himself that wielding the Emperor’s Seal in the tournament meant he had little to worry about—no one stood a chance against him. Soon after, a disciple led Guanyu to his assigned room on Tigerhead Peak.

Upon arrival, Guanyu’s first priority was locating the latrine. His traumatic experience at Convergence Peak still haunted him. He ventured alone to inspect the facilities and was relieved to find that, though the latrine’s design mirrored Convergence Peak’s, it was nearly free of waste—likely due to fewer occupants here.

Returning to his room, which Xuanming had arranged, Guanyu found it reasonably spacious but similar to his previous lodgings on Reverie Peak and Convergence Peak. A round wooden table occupied the center, adorned with a teapot and four stools. To the right stood a classical bed against the wall, complete with curtains. While basic amenities were present, the glaring absence of toilet paper irritated him.

Guanyu resolved to purchase a large stock of toilet paper during his next trip to the city—enough to last his entire stay at Yunqing Sect. He couldn’t endure another day using rough xuan paper. The room’s dusty state suggested prolonged neglect, so he decided to clean it himself, realizing Tigerhead Peak likely lacked servants.

A question crossed his mind: Did even Xuanming clean his own quarters? Disciples’ rooms were one thing, but the sect leader’s chambers? Shaking off these thoughts, Guanyu focused on tidying his space.

By dusk, after extensive cleaning, Guanyu headed to Tigerhead Peak’s dining hall. From afar, a pungent earthy odor assaulted his senses. Inside, two lengthy rectangular tables—each over ten meters long—dominated the room, capable of seating fifty. But Guanyu’s concern wasn’t seating; it was the mysterious source of the stench.

Peering through a window into the kitchen, he recoiled at the unsanitary scene: a middle-aged man with grime-encrusted hands and untrimmed nails kneaded dough, shaping dumplings to drop into a boiling pot. Though ostensibly making fried meatballs, the cook’s filthy appearance revolted Guanyu.

Initially sitting to order, Guanyu soon realized this wasn’t a restaurant—meals required queuing. As the hall filled, he joined the line, gagging at the persistent stink. He resolved to complain to Xuanming, wondering if the sect leader ever endured this squalor.

Forcing down a few bites of the unpalatable food, Guanyu sought out Xuanming. “Master, there’s a serious issue—the dining hall’s conditions are appalling!”

Xuanming frowned. “The dining hall? It’s been years since I visited. Is the food disagreeable?”

“Disagreeable? It’s nauseating! The kitchen reeks, and the cook’s hygiene is atrocious!” Guanyu exaggerated.

With a wry smile, Xuanming replied, “We cultivators don’t prioritize culinary matters. After reaching my level, spiritual energy sustains me—I eat perhaps twice monthly.”

Guanyu retorted, “Master, you’ve cultivated for centuries. I’m a novice—I need proper meals to build strength. Elder Lu of Reverie Peak always said, ‘Food is the fuel of life.’ Even cultivators require nourishment.”

Relenting, Xuanming promised kitchen reforms. Grateful, Guanyu returned to his now-clean room, ready to begin his cultivation journey with renewed focus.

Meanwhile, Lin Qiaoqiao arrived at the hospital where her aunt and cousin Xiao Zhu stayed. “How’s Uncle?” she asked urgently.

“Much better—the fever broke,” her aunt reassured.

“Where is he now?”

Xiao Zhu chirped, “Dad’s in the bathroom! Did you bring gifts, Cousin?” Eyeing the packages, she added slyly, “Has Cousin-in-law Guanyu ‘conquered’ you yet?”

“Hush, child!” the aunt scolded, though Lin Qiaoqiao smiled wistfully. “I’d welcome becoming his woman.”

Her aunt counseled patience with Guanyu’s extraordinary life. Lin Qiaoqiao sighed, “Being apart torments me—he consumes my thoughts.”

When the uncle returned, looking gaunt but improved, discussion turned to discharge plans. Lin Qiaoqiao offered them residence at the Lin estate, which Xiao Zhu eagerly endorsed.

As Xiao Zhu devoured gifted chocolates—a rare treat—Lin Qiaoqiao reviewed medical reports. Dr. Wang Wu entered, confirming upcoming surgery. Though suspicious of excessive tests, Lin Qiaoqiao trusted Guanyu’s judgment in choosing this hospital.

When Wang Wu recognized her as “Guanyu’s woman,” his obsequious manner confirmed the staff’s reverence for Guanyu. Assured of proper care, Lin Qiaoqiao departed, her heart oscillating between longing for her lover and anxiety about his dangerous world.
