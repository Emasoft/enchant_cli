“Old Doctor, regardless of any grievances between the Lin family and others, you needn't concern yourself with such matters,” Town Chief Wang said with a drawn face. “What we must address now is Granny Wang’s cause of death. Out of respect for her, I suggest we return her body home for a thorough examination.”

Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng exchanged glances, compelled to accept this course. Guan Yu instructed Lin Zhonggeng to deploy additional Lin family guards to monitor both the Li family members and Town Chief Wang’s wife, ensuring none could escape. With the imminent departure of Second-Leader Wolf alongside Guan Yu to Granny Wang’s residence, reinforcements were crucial—especially given Elder Li’s status as a cultivator requiring heightened vigilance.

Granny Wang’s modest home boasted a spacious courtyard where a massive coffin now lay at its center, the elderly woman’s body resting serenely within. The compound teemed with villagers, spilling beyond the low walls as crowds gathered to witness this grim revelation.

“Old Doctor,” Town Chief Wang’s voice carried a veiled threat, “are you certain about exhuming the body? Disrespecting the deceased is a grave accusation I cannot shoulder lightly. Have you considered the consequences?”

The physician wavered momentarily, aware that failing to uncover foul play could tarnish his reputation irreparably. Guan Yu himself harbored doubts—their suspicions of foul play hinged solely on reports of the town chief’s wife visiting the premises at dawn.

“The chief’s wife likely silenced Granny Wang to aid her Li family kin’s escape,” Guan Yu deduced inwardly. Targeting the elderly widow—a vulnerable, solitary figure—had been a calculated move.

Noting the physician’s hesitation, Lin Zhonggeng stepped forward. “Honored doctor, exhumation is now necessary. It will grant Granny Wang justice, reassure the living, and”—he added pointedly—“validate your medical expertise against those questioning your treatment of her chronic ailments.”

Galvanized, the Old Doctor declared, “Even if it costs my reputation, I’ll prove my competence! Open the coffin!”

Four burly men pried loose the coffin’s massive nails with crowbars and mallets, heaving aside the heavy lid. Within lay Granny Wang, pallid and still. The physician’s trained eye immediately noted absence of poison signs but observed unnaturally dilated pupils, congested forehead veins, and faint bruising around the neck—hallmarks of strangulation.

“She was smothered,” he announced, sparking communal outrage. Villagers clamored for the perpetrator’s execution by fire, their chants swelling like stormwaves.

Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng shared knowing looks—their suspicions confirmed. Town Chief Wang stood ashen-faced, calculating escape routes as the mob’s fury mounted.

“The killer used fabric—likely clothing—to strangle her between four and six this morning,” the physician elaborated, plucking textile fibers from Granny Wang’s neck. Guan Yu examined the body, deducing the murderer had improvised a weapon from available materials.

Turning to the trembling town chief, Guan Yu pressed, “You claimed to have discovered the body at dawn. Yet you ordered immediate encoffinment without proper examination. Why the haste?”

“My wife alerted me after glimpsing Granny Wang collapsed!” the chief blustered, redirecting blame. “Our subordinates witnessed the same!”

Guan Yu dissected the timeline: the pre-dawn discovery, rushed funeral procession meant to mask Li family members escaping disguised as mourners. “Your wife’s ‘coincidental’ sighting aligns too neatly with the Li family’s disappearance,” he countered.

As villagers bayed for the chief’s wife to be summoned, Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng combed Granny Wang’s sparse dwelling—a frugal existence evidenced by worn furniture and bare essentials. Finding no murder weapon, they awaited the crucial interrogation.

“Her death served to enable the Li family’s flight,” Guan Yu murmured to Lin Zhonggeng. “The funeral procession would’ve let them slip away unnoticed. Without evidence, though, the chief will sacrifice his wife to save himself.”

The stage was set: the grieving widow’s humble home now courtroom, her coffin the damning witness against corruption festering beneath the town’s placid surface.
