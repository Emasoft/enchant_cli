The sky was just beginning to lighten when Guan Yu awoke. The heavy rain outside had ceased, though he couldn't fathom why he'd risen so early. Yet Wang Xiaorong had beaten him to it, entering with a lacquered box in her hands as he stirred.

“You’re awake, Guan Yu! Perfect timing—come eat.” She set the box on the table, revealing breakfast fetched from the kitchen.

“What hour is it? Why are you up at this ungodly time?” Guan Yu asked, squinting at the cloud-choked sky that hid the sun’s position.

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “It’s still early. Everyone else is asleep—you could’ve rested longer. See? I put on the beast-hide mask myself without your help. Getting better, aren’t I?” Her laughter tinkled like wind chimes.

Guan Yu nodded, eyeing the disguise snug on her face. The mask’s secrecy was vital—if discovered, disaster would follow. Even her solo trip to the kitchen had unsettled him. “Don’t wander alone again,” he warned. “If you’re hungry, wake me or send Wang Jun. Safety first.”

“I thought the mask would suffice,” she replied, unwrapping steamed buns. “Besides, I wanted us to eat together.”

Her consideration warmed him. With the mask distorting her features into anonymity, he let the matter drop. After breakfast, they found Zou Wuhui surveying the mist-cloaked mountains. “Will we stay another day?” Guan Yu asked.

“The Prince’s orders,” Zou Wuhui confirmed. “Last night’s storm washed out the mountain paths. The carriages can’t pass, and more rain brews. We wait.”

As they walked toward the front hall to settle lodging fees, their stone-paved path gleamed from the downpour. Xiao Zhi’s voice suddenly barked behind them: “Old Cang! Where you off to?”

Wang Xiaorong scowled at the two young men skidding to a halt. “Rushing to your graves?”

“To breakfast!” Wang Jun retorted, earning an eye-roll.

“The kitchen serves all day,” Guan Yu said, remembering his appointment with Du Teng. “Join us if you wish.”

The mess hall buzzed with early diners. Guan Yu’s group claimed a table near the kitchen’s warmth, though Du Teng was nowhere in sight. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi returned with heaping plates, drawing gasps from Wang Xiaorong. “You’ll eat the kitchen bare!”

“Free food shouldn’t go to waste,” Wang Jun grinned through a mouthful of dumpling.

A commotion arose as a disheveled man with bird’s-nest hair took a neighboring seat. His companion—a towering figure with a comically elongated chin—drew stares. The hall fell quiet save for the kitchen’s bellows wheezing like a tired dragon.

Between bites, snatches of conversation floated over: “...challenge the Swordless Immortal today...” “...rather we go together...”

A fly buzzed Wang Jun’s face. He swatted irritably. Crack! Two broken chopsticks suddenly pinned the insects to a pillar—thrown blind by the long-chinned man. Guan Yu’s jaw slackened. To strike moving targets by sound alone... This was the work of a First-Class Supreme expert.

“Incredible...” Wang Jun breathed.

Guan Yu nodded grimly. If such masters hesitated to face the Swordless Immortal, what did that say about the mountain’s lord? His thoughts churned until Du Teng’s arrival cut through the murmurs.

“I take my leave,” the challenger announced. Every eye turned, some pitying, others resigned.

“Brother Du,” Guan Yu urged, “reconsider. The Swordless Villa—”

“My mind’s set.” Du Teng smiled, deathly calm. “If I don’t return... perhaps erect a stone to say I once walked this rivers-and-lakes.”

As they walked toward the mist-wreathed foothills, Du Teng glanced at Guan Yu’s middle-aged disguise. “Clever face. How’d I know you? Only you’d call me ‘Brother’ here.”

The path steepened, damp pines weeping leftover rain. Somewhere above, the Swordless Immortal waited—a legend who’d reigned supreme for decades. Guan Yu’s gut tightened. What Du Teng lacked in power, he compensated in fatalistic resolve. A resolve that might etch his name into tomorrow’s obituary stones.
