When Poison Widow heard that Luo Bo intended to kill Jiubianyun, her heart skipped a beat. Yet for the greater scheme, it seemed this was the only way forward.

Poison Widow acted solely for her own interests. Unlike Yuan Shanding, who valued loyalty deeply, she believed any remaining usefulness by Bill Lin’s side made this venture worthwhile. Without hesitation, she agreed.

Upon arriving at the Yang family’s clinic, the trio was immediately struck by its grandeur. *The Yangs truly spare no expense,* Poison Widow mused inwardly. *Even a clinic is built with such opulence.*

Feng Family Head and Luo Bo showed little reaction. At the entrance, their car was stopped. Only after verifying their identities and inspecting a series of documents were they permitted entry.

Luo Bo parked in the courtyard and remarked, “The security here is tighter than expected. Without your status, they’d never have allowed us in.”

Feng Family Head smiled faintly. “Naturally. This place is stricter than some prisons precisely because of its reputation for safety. That’s why influential figures prefer to seek treatment here.”

He added sternly, “I’ll gather information shortly. Stay put for now. Roaming these two massive buildings blindly will only waste time.”

Luo Bo and Poison Widow nodded. They drove to the underground parking lot, where elevators provided direct access to each floor.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-Nine: No Room for Carelessness**

Young Master Feng had already been assigned a room on the third floor, reserved for the Yang family’s business associates—wealthy merchants who paid handsomely for treatment. Like them, Feng Family Head had sent a substantial red envelope to Old Master Yang in advance.

Otherwise, the guards would never have allowed their entry. Only Yang family members received free treatment; even their cleaning staff were accommodated without charge, albeit on lower floors. The hierarchy was clear: higher floors offered better environments and superior care.

Prominent figures, though financially dependent on the Yangs, received top-tier treatment gratis. The Yangs curried their favor to ensure smooth business operations. Others paid exorbitantly, with red envelopes determining their floor assignments. The first floor housed servants and distant relatives, while each ascending level improved in luxury and medical resources.

Feng Family Head’s third-floor placement indicated his sizable bribe. Despite the clinic’s lavish appearance, it operated at a loss. State-of-the-art equipment and world-class specialists drained funds, while income relied solely on “gifts” from associates like Feng. Yet the Yangs tolerated the deficit, valuing the political capital it bought.

Upon entering the third floor, a young nurse escorted Feng to Room 314.

“Thank you, Nurse. When will my treatment begin?”

She checked her clipboard professionally. “You’ll need an electrocardiogram first. A doctor will notify you afterward.”

“Thank you,” Feng replied courteously. Every action here reflected on his family’s reputation—no carelessness permitted.

Once alone, Feng instructed his companions: “Stay here. I’ll investigate during my ECG.”

Soon, the nurse returned. “Mr. Feng, please follow me.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Thirty: A Disordered Facade**

As Feng left, Poison Widow muttered, “This place is a maze. How do we find Jiubianyun if we can’t search?”

“We’ll act tonight if Feng fails,” Luo Bo said coldly. “Kill her swiftly and leave. No traces.”

Feng followed the nurse, resisting distractions as he strategized. “Nurse, might I have a floor plan? I fear getting lost.”

“Your chest badge lists your room number. Any nurse can guide you back,” she replied politely.

Undeterred, Feng feigned confusion during his ECG. “Isn’t this the fourth floor? I was certain…”

The doctor frowned. “Each floor has its own ECG room. You’re on three.”

“But I came from four!” Feng insisted, hiding his badge.

When the doctor stepped out to verify, Feng discarded his badge and slipped away. He scoured floors, seeking guarded rooms where Jiubianyun might be held.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Thirty-One: Not as Expected**

A broadcast soon alerted staff to search for a missing patient. Cornered, Feng played lost. “Isn’t this three?”

“Let me escort you,” a nurse insisted.

After completing tests, Feng returned empty-handed. “I’ve checked floors one to three. She’s not there.”

“Let us help,” Poison Widow urged.

“No. Cameras everywhere. My status shields me; yours won’t.”

That evening, Feng ventured to the fifth floor—exclusive to tycoons. Each door had a dedicated nurse.

“Looking for someone?” a nurse challenged, noting his third-floor badge.

“Jiubianyun. Admitted today.”

“No one here by that name.”

Defeated, Feng descended. On four, chatter filled halls. Yet time ran short—staff were already searching.

“Sir, let’s return you,” another nurse interjected.

Resigned, Feng complied. The hunt would resume, but patience was paramount.
