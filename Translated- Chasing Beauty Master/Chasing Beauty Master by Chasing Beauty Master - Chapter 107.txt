“What’s all this commotion? What are these kids up to? Have they no respect for the law? How dare they cause such a scene!”

……

Yet, did those old rivals from the past know that Guan Yu was his adopted grandson? If unaware, matters might still be manageable. But once this connection came to light, the situation would undoubtedly grow far more complicated! With such a glaring vulnerability exposed, those former adversaries would surely exploit it to the fullest. Old Master Liu inhaled deeply, closing his eyes in resignation.

……

Chapter 260: Coming to Arrest Me?

……

Utterly oblivious that his actions at the school gate had drawn such widespread attention—with certain eyes now firmly locked upon him—Guan Yu chatted merrily with the local thugs and hoodlums.

Suddenly, provincial authorities dispatched special agents to oversee the investigation of this case. These newcomers were naturally trusted subordinates of the Jin family’s higher-ups. As Director Nie anxiously awaited Old Master Liu’s call, the provincial agents were already en route.

“Director Nie, we’ve obtained concrete information and evidence regarding the instigator of this riot and public disorder. Provincial authorities will shortly send you the suspect’s profile. Before my arrival, ensure arrest warrants and bulletins are distributed to all jurisdictions. We must act swiftly—this brazen criminal cannot be allowed to escape!” The provincial supervisor’s call carried an ironclad tone.

This was disastrous. Director Nie acquiesced repeatedly before hanging up and urgently contacting Old Master Liu.

……

Alas, retired officials held no real power. Though Old Master Liu retained some influence and disciples across local governments, he found himself powerless against deliberate obstruction from old foes. Staying silent might leave room for negotiation; intervening could turn this chess game into checkmate.

While emperors remained calm, eunuchs fretted. Guan Yu, utterly unaware of the webs being woven around him or the efforts expended on his behalf, bid farewell to the gang leaders in high spirits. Drinking heartily with Luo Cheng and Niu Le at his restaurant, he left others scrambling to resolve his troubles.

……

In a military guesthouse in N City, a white-haired old man listened to his guard’s report. “We’ve verified the hospital director’s claims. The late-stage uremia patient was indeed cured without surgery. Here are the medical records and recent activity logs.” The guard handed over documents and photos.

“Good. As long as Director Yu’s account is truthful,” the old man nodded calmly. “Has Jingjing’s transfer been arranged?”

“Though we confirmed the treatment evidence, the young man responsible remains untraceable. We… haven’t identified him yet.”

“I asked about Jingjing’s arrangements,” the old man repeated, reclining in his mahogany chair.

“Sir, given the young mistress’s frail health, long travel is inadvisable. We recommend finding this youth and bringing him to Beijing.”

The old man sighed. “Spare no effort. Fang Zhe, I’ve faced cannon fire without flinching, but watching my granddaughter… Find him at any cost. He may name his price—only her life matters now.”

Fang Zhe snapped a salute. “Understood, sir. We’ll deploy all resources immediately.”

“Mind your approach. Such talents often have quirks. Be courteous—no military bluntness.”

……

Half an hour later, Fang Zhe emerged from Mother Luo’s home. After initial alarm, she’d cooperated upon learning his Zhongnanhai Special Guard status. Now armed with Guan Yu’s address, Fang Zhe smiled. “Yijing Villa Area. Let’s move.”

……

Meanwhile, after drunken farewells, Guan Yu and Niu Le took a taxi home. Worried about Du Xiaojuan facing school gossip alone, Guan Yu tensed when her call came.

“Guan Yu… Where are you? It’s so late… I’m scared!” Her trembling voice pleaded.

“Almost home. What’s wrong?”

“There… there are police outside! Sirens, pounding doors—I don’t know what’s happening!”

Police? Could this be about the school incident? Were they here to arrest him?

……

Chapter 261: Arrest and Detention

Hearing Du Xiaojuan’s panic, Guan Yu’s heart clenched. Fleeing would leave her terrified. Steeling himself, he told Niu Le: “Get a hotel tonight. Don’t come back.”

Confused but compliant, Niu Le stumbled into a massage parlor while Guan Yu raced home.

Approaching his villa, he found eight police cars and shouting officers. “Looking for someone?” Guan Yu quipped casually.

“Hands up!” An officer recognized him from the warrant. Guns cocked in unison as searchlights hit his face.

“Show me the arrest warrant,” Guan Yu demanded calmly. The agent flashed the document. “Let me reassure my girlfriend first.”

“Take him!” the provincial supervisor barked. When Guan Yu insisted, the official pistol-whipped him, bloodying his face. “Resist again and I’ll shoot!”

Director Nie intervened: “Let him speak to her. Basic humanity—”

“This suspect faces multiple charges!” the supervisor countered. “Move him now!”

As officers grabbed him, Guan Yu roared: “I need to see her!” Another brutal strike followed. “One more word and you’re dead!”

……

Chapter 262: Bloodied Eyes, Death’s Visage

The provincial agent sneered—this local upstart had dared cross the Jin family. His mission: crush this troublemaker and uproot his allies. Tonight’s brutality was just the beginning.
