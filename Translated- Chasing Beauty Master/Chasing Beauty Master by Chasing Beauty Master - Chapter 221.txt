Upon hearing those final two words, Qian Tong suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of liberation.

He wouldn't answer any of Guan Yu's questions. At worst, he'd endure another venomous snake bite before Guan Yu sent him to meet his maker. What did he have to fear? Yet how gravely he miscalculated – a catastrophic error of judgment.

"How many pawns like you has Wan Qianshan (Myriad Peaks) planted in N City? Who are they?" Guan Yu demanded.

Qian Tong remained silent – though truthfully, he couldn't speak even if willing.

Guan Yu rose abruptly from his chair, clamping his right hand over Qian Tong's swollen mouth. Resigned to death, Qian Tong mentally cursed eighteen generations of Guan Yu's ancestors, yet instead of suffocation, he felt an unexpected coolness spreading across his lips.

The sausage-like swelling from Guan Yu's earlier kicks gradually subsided under this strange chill. When the pressure lifted moments later, Qian Tong's jaw hung slack – not from paralysis, but sheer astonishment.

Though residual puffiness remained, the fiery pain had vanished. As Qian Tong marveled at this devil's touch that healed as readily as harmed, Guan Yu's next words confirmed his deepest dread – this man straddled the line between human and spectral entity.

"Don't say I lack mercy," Guan Yu resumed his seat with feline grace. "I'm granting you speech to answer. The choice is yours."

"Just kill me already, you bastard!" Qian Tong spat... then froze in shock. His voice! The snake's venom... how?

Testing other limbs brought disappointment – paralysis remained – yet this miraculous recovery of speech alone shattered his understanding of reality.

"Still unwilling?" Guan Yu's smile widened like a crescent blade.

Qian Tong's eyelid twitched violently before he snarled, "Screw your whore mother!"

His triumphant defiance curdled into horror as he watched – utterly helpless – a serpent begin its slow, deliberate crawl into his gaping mouth. Though slender enough to slip down his throat with ease, the mere obstruction triggered involuntary voiding, fouling the air with acrid stench.

Guan Yu observed coldly as the reptile disappeared entirely into Qian Tong's convulsing body. This theatrical cruelty wasn't about extracting information – it was retribution. Every twitch of the snake within became an exquisitely calibrated torture.

When the creature's tail finally vanished, Qian Tong truly comprehended Guan Yu's promise of "a fate worse than death."

Chapter 450: Your Silence Changes Nothing

Veins bulged on Qian Tong's forehead as cold sweat drenched him. Unearthly guttural moans escaped his lips while imagined horrors multiplied – what vile acts might this living invader commit within his organs? Kidneys... liver... spleen... all seemed to twist in sympathetic agony.

"Comfortable?" Guan Yu reclined with mocking ease.

"You... demon!" Qian Tong rasped through bloodied teeth.

"The true demonry hasn't begun." Guan Yu examined his nails. "I vowed you'd beg for death's release."

As new convulsions wracked his body – kidneys first, then lungs constricted by serpentine coils – Qian Tong's complexion cycled through morbid hues. Each organ's violation brought fresh hell: labored breathing, oxygen-starved dizziness, only to be shocked awake by liver-crushing anguish.

When the torture shifted to his spleen, Qian Tong's resolve shattered. Bestial howls echoed through the building, startling Feng Xin downstairs from her tea. Now he understood – compared to this, Zhong Liang's quick death had been mercy.

"K-kill me..." Qian Tong pleaded through crimson-frothed lips.

"Opportunities missed stay missed," Guan Yu intoned, unmoved.

"But... Wan Qianshan's secrets..." The broken man grasped at final bargaining chips.

"All truths reveal themselves in time," Guan Yu shrugged. "You've outlived your usefulness."

As realization dawned, Qian Tong's death rattle crescendoed – not from renewed torture, but psychological annihilation. Even when Guan Yu mercifully stilled the internal predator, residual trauma kept the man writhing.

In his final moments, Qian Tong's bulging eyes witnessed Guan Yu leveling a pistol. "I salute your fortitude," the executioner declared. "This ends swiftly."

The named roster froze Qian Tong's dying mind – Chen Biao, Wang Dahu, Yang Long, Zhou Jin, Chu Hong... How? He'd never uttered these co-conspirators! As the bullet pierced his heart, his last thought crystallized: Wan Qianshan would fall to this enigma.

"Your silence changed nothing," Guan Yu murmured, closing those sightless eyes. The room's fetid air couldn't mask his own pallor – gunplay still churned his stomach, accustomed though he was to poison's cleaner kill.

Chapter 551: Purge (Part 1)

Downstairs, all eyes tracked Guan Yu's descent with new wariness. "Why the stares?" he feigned nonchalance.

"Brutal methods," Feng Xin remarked, though her gaze held calculation rather than judgment.

"You watched?"

"Your victim's operatic screams required no visuals." Her nose wrinkled. "Even banshees would blush at that performance."

Guan Yu's shrug didn't mask his satisfaction. The subsequent strategy session unfolded efficiently – Feng Xin would summon the remaining power players: the Lin and Xu families. With the fallen Xu clan's void, N City's underworld required... restructuring.

As they departed for Old Master Feng's villa, cleanup crews discovered Qian Tong's remains. Seasoned enforcers retched at the tableau, their whispered reassessments of Guan Yu carrying equal parts awe and terror.

The old master's greeting held gruff affection. "Finally remembered this fossil, eh?" His eyes twinkled behind spectacles as Guan Yu's healing hands worked on aged joints, the charade of massage masking his system's true capabilities.

Over steaming dishes, strategic discussions intertwined with familial warmth. "That vermin clan..." the patriarch growled through rice, "...needs erasing." His chopsticks pointed like a general's baton.

Feng Xin's sidelong glance at Guan Yu held unspoken questions. His answering nod sealed fates – N City's underworld would soon run red, baptized in the storm of Guan Yu's vengeance.
