Niu Le gripped his machete, itching for confrontation. When he saw someone charging forward, his eyes lit up. Without waiting for Guan Yu’s order, he brandished his blade and surged ahead.

“Gonna chop you to pieces, you bastard! Hack, hack—fuck your mother!” Niu Le swiftly overpowered his opponent. Ignoring his own bleeding shoulder, he relentlessly swung his machete while snarling curses.

This suicidal ferocity stunned the onlookers. The hesitant underlings gulped as they stared at the gaunt boy curled against the wall, his shredded shirt revealing a blood-soaked back with mangled flesh—a gruesome sight.

“Who’s next?” Niu Le barked, planting his feet and thrusting his blade toward the crowd.

“Enough talk! Let’s gut them!” Tian Hao roared, snatching a fallen machete and charging.

The mob scattered like startled birds. Niu Le and Tian Hao gave chase until Guan Yu called them back.

Gripping Jin Cheng’s bloodied chin, Guan Yu smirked at his swollen, battered face. “You called me out. Here I am. What’s your play, ‘man’?” he rasped, slapping Jin Cheng’s cheek.

“N-nothing…” Jin Cheng wheezed, nose flattened against the wall. Blood bubbles gurgled from his nostrils with each labored breath.

“Nothing? So you just wanted a beating?” Guan Yu tilted his head mockingly.

Terrified by the machetes in Niu Le and Tian Hao’s hands, Jin Cheng trembled. “M-misunderstanding! Your men attacked mine—I came to talk peace!”

These lunatics had struck first, far exceeding normal brawl limits. Jin Cheng had intended to solidify his authority by crushing these newcomers. Instead, his reputation lay in tatters.

Though seething with humiliation, survival instincts prevailed. “H-how do we settle this?” he stammered, wiping clotted blood from his eyelids.

Guan Yu jabbed Jin Cheng’s forehead. “Your thugs apologize publicly by sundown. Name their backer. Otherwise…” His voice turned glacial. “This ends today.”

**Chapter 248: They’re Not to Be Trifled With**

Jin Cheng blinked dazedly. Apologies? Conspiracies? He didn’t even know why his men had clashed with these demons.

“Understood?” Guan Yu tightened his grip on Jin Cheng’s face.

“Y-yes!”

“Scram.” Guan Yu swatted Jin Cheng’s head like a misbehaving child.

The former campus king staggered away, bloodied handprints smearing the walls like macabre blossoms.

Leaning against the wall, Guan Yu offered cigarettes to his crew. “Hurt?”

“Just a shoulder scratch,” Niu Le shrugged.

“Change clothes at the dorm.” Guan Yu dismissed medical concerns—his healing magic could handle minor wounds.

Classroom doors creaked open as students whispered:

“Who are those freshmen? Four against twenty!”

“Total badasses!”

“Temporary victory. Big Brother Jin’s got gang connections. This isn’t over…”

The administration feigned ignorance, delegating discipline to instructor Liu Shilei. Finding Guan Yu missing again, she massaged her temples and dialed his number.

“Where are you, troublemaker?”

“Changing clothes. Be right there.”

In her office, Guan Yu played innocent. “They attacked us first! Should we’ve let twenty thugs chop us up?”

Liu Shilei sighed. “That Jin Cheng’s hospitalized relatives are pressing charges. His uncle’s a city official. This could escalate.”

**Chapter 249: The Why**

Post-lunch, Liu Shilei summoned Guan Yu again. “They’ve filed police reports. We need damage control.”

As Guan Yu apologized, enraged shouts erupted downstairs.

“Which classroom? I’ll skin that bastard alive!”

A bald brute with a dozen henchmen shoved past Liu Shilei. “Bitch, move!”

Guan Yu stormed out, crew in tow.

“Looking for me?” he challenged, shielding Liu Shilei.

The leader, Jin Xing, gaped at Guan Yu’s composure. “You crippled my brother. Why?”

Liu Shilei intervened: “Youthful hotheads—”

“Stay out of this!” Jin Xing brandished a wrapped weapon. “Give me one good reason not to end you!”

Guan Yu met his glare. “Self-defense. Your brother brought twenty blades. Ask him why.”
