“Golden Flower (Jinhua)” said with a cheerful smile, holding a white towel in her hand that appeared freshly soaked in hot water. Approaching Guanyu, she handed him the towel and remarked, “Wipe yourself off. There’s just one last dish left—it’ll be ready soon.” Every gesture Golden Flower made for Guanyu was observed by Second-to-Wolf (Jin Cilang), who mused that if Golden Flower were Sakurako (Yingzi), she would likely treat Guanyu with the same meticulous care.

**Chapter 2325: I Don’t Care**

Golden Flower (Jinhua) chuckled warmly, clutching a steaming white towel. She approached Guanyu and offered it to him, saying, “Clean yourself up. The final dish is almost done.” As Golden Flower attended to Guanyu, Second-to-Wolf (Jin Cilang) watched pensively, imagining that if Sakurako were here, she too would dote on Guanyu with such tenderness.

During the meal, Second-to-Wolf couldn’t help but remark, “Ah, what a lavish spread! The flavors are exceptional. You’re truly fortunate, Guanyu.”

Secretly, Second-to-Wolf lamented Sakurako’s abysmal cooking skills—her one glaring flaw. Despite her countless virtues, culinary prowess eluded her. Over the years, she had diligently studied cookbooks and techniques, yet every dish she prepared for him ended in disappointment. Her skills remained stubbornly stagnant, frozen at the level of a teenager’s haphazard attempts.

Golden Flower beamed. “Of course! This feast is both to welcome you and bid farewell to A’Cai. Since you’re leaving tomorrow, I wanted to make this last meal memorable. I’ve spent hours preparing everything—please enjoy!”

A’Cai hesitated awkwardly, too reserved to eat freely. Noticing this, Guanyu placed a large shrimp in his bowl and advised, “Treat this place as your home, A’Cai. Eat whatever you like. Don’t hold back—act like a man, understand?”

“Yes, I will,” A’Cai replied with a timid smile. Meanwhile, Second-to-Wolf devoured the meal with gusto, savoring a rare moment of indulgence amidst his nomadic lifestyle. Between mouthfuls, he remarked, “Guanyu, once you regain your memories and reclaim your peak Nascent Soul cultivation, such cozy dinners will become luxuries of the past.”

Guanyu nodded solemnly. The comment immediately drew Golden Flower and A’Cai’s attention.

“Peak Nascent Soul?”
“You’re recovering your memories?”

They exclaimed in unison, their faces etched with shock. Golden Flower wondered why Guanyu suddenly spoke of memory restoration, while A’Cai gaped at the revelation that his companion might be a deity-like Nascent Soul expert.

Guanyu addressed Golden Flower first. “You may not know this, but earlier, when Second-to-Wolf channeled his qi into me, he discovered something in my mind.”

“What?” she pressed, alarmed by his grave tone.

“You recall Zhang Han’s seal, correct?” Guanyu countered.

“Of course—the Whirlpool Seal in his mind,” Golden Flower replied. “According to the Bamboo Scrolls, it’s a unique demonic clan technique. Does this relate to your memories?”

Guanyu steadied himself. “Second Brother found the same seal—a Whirlpool Seal—in my mind.”

The words struck Golden Flower like thunder. She swayed slightly, struggling to process the implications. “So…your amnesia isn’t from injury but this seal? This…this can’t be real!”

“It is,” Guanyu confirmed calmly. “I don’t know why I’m bound by a demonic seal or how I’m connected to their kind. Only restored memories will reveal the truth.”

Golden Flower pressed further, eyes gleaming. “Do you have a way to break it? Have you obtained the Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Realm?” Her mind raced—if Zhang Han could also be freed, her family’s vengeance might finally be attainable.

Guanyu shook his head, glancing at the bewildered A’Cai. Though the youth understood little, he hung on every word, enthralled by the prospect of Guanyu’s godlike status.

“I lack full certainty,” Guanyu admitted. “Before losing my memories, I grew close to Second Brother’s sister. When we parted, I gifted her a golden dagger. Based on Sakurako’s accounts, I suspect it’s either a Nascent Soul Relic or the key to breaking my seal. Once we settle matters here, I’ll retrieve Sakurako and study the dagger.”

Second-to-Wolf elaborated, “As a cultivator, you know peak Nascent Souls can glimpse the future. Guanyu must have foreseen calamity and left that dagger as a failsafe—a key only he could use.”

Golden Flower’s eyes widened. “If it’s truly a Nascent Soul Relic, that aligns with ancient texts! Such relics are the only known counters to demonic seals. The Feng Clan’s ‘Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Realm’ must be one too—they just renamed it ignorantly.”

“The Feng Clan? Of the Four Great Families?” Second-to-Wolf interjected. “When their young master hired me to kill Guanyu, I swindled 200 million from him! Had I known about their relic…”

Guanyu shot him a withering look. “Even 2 billion wouldn’t make them surrender a family heirloom. Their defenses are fortress-like—I barely escaped alive during my last incursion. Hundreds of guards, snipers, electrified walls…”

Second-to-Wolf scoffed. “With our combined strength, we could slaughter our way in!”

“We’re after the relic, not a massacre,” Guanyu retorted. “The Fengs have Bill Clan backing—foreign mercenaries immune to local laws. Their compound rivals a military base. Last time, only Gambir’s (Ganbili) diversion saved me.”

Undeterred, Second-to-Wolf grinned. “A challenge! Let’s plan a stealth retrieval. No bloodshed…mostly.”

Golden Flower warned, “The Bills station snipers round-the-clock. One misstep and—”

“Enough talk!” Second-to-Wolf slammed the table. “Four billion, Guanyu. I’ll fetch your relic. But if I die, tell Sakurako…tell her I died rich!”
