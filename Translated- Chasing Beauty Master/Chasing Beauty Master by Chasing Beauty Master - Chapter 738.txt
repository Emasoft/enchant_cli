“Who says I’ll never grow up? I’ve already grown up! Who says you can’t eat snacks while beating people up?” Zhang Han pouted her little mouth in protest, still licking the lollipop clutched in her hand.

“What did you come here for? If it’s nothing, hurry back. Class is about to start.” Guan Yu urged impatiently.

“Of course it’s important! But I’m exhausted from running all the way here. I need to recharge with this lollipop first.”

“Then what exactly do you need from me?” Guan Yu sighed in resignation.

“I want you to train with me every day! The taekwondo competition is coming up soon, and I’m desperate to improve. But practicing alone is so boring. That’s why I came to drag you along!” Zhang Han declared, utterly ignoring the stares from their classmates.

**Chapter 1872: So You Were Lying**

“I don’t have time right now. I’ll train with you when I’m free, okay? Go back for now.” Guan Yu planned to deal with future problems later—his priority was shooing her away.

“Hmph! You said it yourself! No take-backs! I even recorded it!” She rummaged through her tiny bag, pulled out a phone, and triumphantly waved the saved recording. “If you break your promise, I’ll tell Auntie you bullied me…and spanked my butt!”

Guan Yu watched helplessly, shaking his head. Dealing with this little ancestor was pure torture.

Nearby, Wei Hongwei—a self-proclaimed admirer of Zhang Han—overheard their exchange. His heart shattered as he misinterpreted their relationship. Tears streamed down his face until a sudden realization struck: “Wait…‘Uncle’? Brother Guan is Zhang Han’s uncle by marriage? Her aunt is Yang Conghan, who’s Brother Guan’s girlfriend! So they’re family! Haha, that explains it!” Relief washed over him.

Zhang Han suddenly hopped off Guan Yu’s lap and extended her hand imperiously. “Let’s go.” Her demeanor mimicked an adult leading a child home.

“Go where?” Guan Yu frowned.

“To train with me, obviously! You promised—no take-backs!” She stuck out her lower lip.

“I…” Guan Yu faltered.

“You said you’d come when you had time! I have proof! You liar…waaaah!” She plopped back onto his lap, wriggling and kicking her feet. “I’ll tell Auntie you bullied me!”

The petite girl’s squirming triggered unfortunate physiological reactions. Guan Yu’s head throbbed as if struck by a bomb. “Alright, alright! I said I’d go when I’m free. I’m not lying!” He chose his words carefully, fearing further outbursts.

“But you’re free right now! You’re lying! Lying liar!” Her tantrum escalated until Guan Yu surrendered: “Fine! I’ll go with you now!”

Classmates watched in awe. The notoriously fierce Zhang Han—who once hospitalized a suitor for daring to approach her—was now a pouting child in Guan Yu’s arms. None dared cross her normally; her combat skills and the Yang family’s influence made her untouchable. Yet this untamable beauty had everyone’s idol wrapped around her finger.

“Yay! Let’s go!” Instantly sunny, Zhang Han grabbed his hand and skipped out.

**Chapter 1873: Meddling Troubles**

“Where are we training, little ancestor?” Guan Yu asked as they left the building.

“Just follow me!” She licked her lollipop, leading him toward a secluded grove instead of the usual gym.

At fifteen, Zhang Han was a prodigy—acing college entrance exams at eleven. The Yang family kept her in school to enjoy childhood, though her whims often defied logic.

“Why not the basketball gym?”

“Boring! I’m tired—carry me!” She raised her arms expectantly.

Defeated, Guan Yu lifted her in a princess carry. “Mmm! So safe and comfy! Your chest is like a squishy pillow!”

“That’s muscle, not sponge,” he grumbled.

Their path intersected with Chen Maosheng, freshly discharged from the hospital. The lecherous heir appraised Zhang Han hungrily. “New fling, Guan Yu? Public displays are tacky.”

“Meddling creep! Take your ugly eyes off me or I’ll gouge them out!” Zhang Han brandished her lollipop like a sword.

Chen smirked as thirty thugs emerged. “Let’s see you try.”

Guan Yu remained calm. “Back for more hospital time, Chen?”

“Today you’ll graduate to the morgue!” Chen spat. More reinforcements arrived, swelling their numbers to eighty.

Zhang Han yawned. “Annoying flies. You handle them, Uncle—but keep holding me!”

As attackers charged, a golden shield shimmered around Guan Yu. Each assailant recoiled as if hitting a wall, crashing into comrades. Zhang Han clapped in delight while Chen paled.

“He’s a demon!” someone cried.

“Pathetic,” Guan Yu sneered, advancing unscathed. “Our ‘cosmic super cutie’ wants a walk. Move.”

Chen’s bravado crumbled. “Kill them!” he shrieked from a safe distance.

**Chapter 1874: Murderous Glare**

The mob hesitated. Rumors of Zhang Han’s lethal kicks and Guan Yu’s invincibility froze them.

“Useless! We outnumber them!” Chen roared.

Zhang Han sighed. “They’re asking to die. You fight—I might kill them by accident.”

Guan Yu’s shield brightened. “These minions? A hundred more wouldn’t matter.”

The insult galvanized the crowd. Fists flew—only to rebound catastrophically. Bodies piled up as the pair strolled through chaos, untouched.

Chen, now trembling, ordered a retreat. Guan Yu’s laughter echoed. “Still think numbers matter?”

Zhang Han yawned again, snapping her lollipop stick. “Boring. Let’s find somewhere quieter.”

As they disappeared into the trees, Chen collapsed, his revenge plot in ruins. The grove echoed with Zhang Han’s giggles and the groans of defeated thugs.
