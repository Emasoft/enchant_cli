Xiao Zhi wore a look of helplessness as he complained, “Isn’t this enough? Guan Yu, I’m begging you—stop messing with me, alright?”

“That won’t do. This last challenge is a benefit I must secure for everyone,” Guan Yu replied with a chuckle. “Besides, if we skip this part, our fellow sect brothers and sisters will surely blame me.”

Siqi gazed curiously at Guan Yu and asked, “What exactly are you planning? Is this truly for everyone’s benefit?”

“Of course! Hahaha!” Guan Yu glanced around before declaring, “Now, all sect brothers present here are in luck—including the Juhe Peak sisters inside the house. Everyone gets to share in this fortune!”

He continued, “Next, it’s time for Xiao Zhi to distribute blessings. Since today is your joyous occasion, we’re all celebrating with you. So, you must give each sect brother and sister here—including those inside—a red envelope containing two taels of silver.”

“These two taels will also symbolize the depth of your love for Du Bingyan (Ice Swallow). Surely, a wealthy man like you wouldn’t hesitate over such a trifling sum, right?”

**Chapter 4739: Long-Planned Scheme**

The crowd erupted into cheers the moment Guan Yu finished speaking, all agreeing that Xiao Zhi ought to “bleed” a little for the occasion.

In truth, Xiao Zhi had only prepared a few red envelopes for specific rituals, none to spare for this sudden demand. Though he didn’t begrudge the silver, his face tightened with worry—he simply hadn’t brought enough. On such a happy day, giving red envelopes was customary, yet he found himself at a loss.

Noticing his distress, Guan Yu waved to Wang Jun, who approached with a broad grin and produced a large red cloth bag. Inside were dozens of smaller red pouches, each holding two taels of silver.

“Last night, Guan Yu told me to prepare these,” Wang Jun announced. “I’ll lend them to you now, but after the wedding, you must repay me double. No backing out, understand?”

Xiao Zhi shot Guan Yu an exasperated look. During their drinking session the previous night, Guan Yu had persuaded Wang Jun to prepare these envelopes, claiming they’d prove useful. Now, Xiao Zhi had no choice but to borrow them—with interest.

Wang Jun considered this a shrewd deal. Xiao Zhi, after all, was wealthy, and with prestigious guests from the Yunqing Sect showering Xuanzhong Peak with gifts, repayment would be no issue.

Guan Yu grinned. “Just accept your fate, Xiao Zhi. Look at all these sect brothers and sisters waiting for their red envelopes!”

“Fine. It’s clear you all conspired against me,” Xiao Zhi sighed, resigning himself.

Nearly twenty sect members—brothers from Yunqing and sisters from Juhe Peak—lined up. Xiao Zhi distributed the envelopes, though some overeager disciples snatched extras. Even Guan Yu, despite his wealth, took one for luck.

Once done, Xiao Zhi groaned, “Guan Yu, can I see my bride now?”

“Of course! But one last condition: you must carry our beautiful bride to the sedan chair yourself. It’ll emphasize her dignity,” Guan Yu declared.

Though tradition dictated the couple walk hand-in-hand with a red silk flower, Xiao Zhi gladly agreed. Du Bingyan (Ice Swallow) was light, and he eagerly pushed open the door to find her waiting, veiled beneath a crimson hood.

With a laugh, he swept her onto his back. Clinging happily, Du Bingyan (Ice Swallow) radiated joy as firecrackers crackled and Guan Yu shouted, “The bride enters the sedan! Let the procession begin!”

Mounted on his steed, Xiao Zhi led the way to Xuanzhong Peak. Behind him, eight burly sect brothers strained under the weight of the ornate “eight-person sedan”—a custom-made marvel so heavy it required sixteen bearers on standby. To ease their burden, Elder Zheng devised a solution: Xuanming, the sect leader, cast a Levitation Spell on the sedan, lightening its load significantly.

This rare spell, mastered only by Xuanming, turned a typically impractical art into a lifesaver. Without it, the bearers would have struggled immensely. Now, the procession moved smoothly, the spell lasting the entire journey.

**Chapter 4740: Reunion**

“You really set me up,” Xiao Zhi grumbled to Guan Yu. “Now I owe Wang Jun dozens of taels—double! This was all your scheme!”

“So what?” Guan Yu retorted smugly. “Shouldn’t you spend generously on your wedding day? Or do you regret marrying such a beauty over mere silver?”

“Of course not!” Xiao Zhi protested. “I’d pay hundreds without hesitation!”

“Empty words,” Wang Jun teased. “You looked ready to faint at the thought of parting with a few taels!”

Laughing, Xiao Zhi countered, “Even if I lacked funds, Guan Yu would lend them. What are friends for?”

“Don’t drag me into this,” Guan Yu playfully refused. “Your wedding, your expenses. I’m here to make things difficult today!”

The boisterous group arrived at Xuanzhong Peak, now packed to capacity with sect members. Firecrackers boomed as Elder Lu officiated the ceremony. Crossing a fire basin, the couple knelt before Elder Zheng and Luo Jie (Luo Family Matriarch), their parents.

Elder Lu, ever the humorist, chided Luo Jie when she nearly interrupted the rites. “The ceremony requires bowing to elders! Control your excitement!”

Amid laughter, Elder Zheng addressed the crowd. “Thank you all for honoring Xuanzhong Peak. Enjoy the festivities, and my deepest gratitude to Sect Leader Xuanming for his support.”

In the throng, Guan Yu spotted Xiao Dong—a deaf-mute disciple from the back mountains—gesturing toward the rear hall. Realizing Elder Jiu (Longevity Elder) and other reclusive elders waited there, Guan Yu noted the couple would later pay respects to them.

Following tradition, Xiao Zhi lifted Du Bingyan’s (Ice Swallow) veil with his hands instead of a steelyard pole, revealing her tearful smile. Elder Lu then presented golden leaves shaped into a flower, symbolizing enduring love.

**Chapter 4741: Honoring the Elders**

Elder Zheng gifted Du Bingyan (Ice Swallow) a martial manual once used by the legendary Swordless Immortal. Blushing, she corrected herself after Elder Lu’s reminder: “Thank you… Father.”

Xuanming bestowed upon Xiao Zhi an ancient tome titled *Spiritual Beasts and the Cosmos*, sparking his exhilaration. “Thank you, Sect Leader!” he exclaimed, kowtowing.

Other elders offered gifts—some lavish, others modest. Elder Xiang’s golden hairpin drew quiet amusement, given his notorious frugality.

As the ceremony concluded, the newlyweds retreated to greet hidden elders, their joy echoing through a sect united in celebration.
