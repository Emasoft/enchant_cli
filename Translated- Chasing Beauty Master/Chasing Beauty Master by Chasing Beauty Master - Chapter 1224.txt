Helpless, Guan Yu knew relying on this crude woman was impossible. Now his only hope lay in meeting her mentioned master. All he wanted was to return swiftly to Front Return Peak. With night deepening, Lin Qiaoqiao and others must be frantic with worry.

The more Guan Yu walked, the angrier he became. Exhausted from escaping the forest, he'd taken the wrong path—only to encounter this unreasonable woman who neither yielded to threats nor persuasion. Misfortune truly plagued him.

Women on Yunqing Mountain? This surprised Guan Yu. Of the two disciples met today, Ling Su proved treacherous while this woman was downright boorish. Disappointment weighed heavy.

Approaching closed gates far less imposing than the Ancestral Hall's rear mountain entrance, the woman behind shouted, "World, open!"

The gates creaked ajar, revealing two women. Guan Yu's eyes brightened.

Two fair-faced maidens stood before him. Their plain white robes, embroidered with sky-blue floral patterns from hem to waist, accentuated graceful figures with deep purple sashes. The attire blended elegance with subtle luxury.

Most striking were their plunging necklines. Guan Yu's gaze feasted hungrily, noticing other identically dressed women within. These Convergence Peak disciples' revealing garments suggested their master must be male.

"You're back, junior sister? Who's this man?" one woman demanded. "Bringing males here? Master will punish you!"

"Senior sister misunderstands," the escort replied. "I found this suspicious man lurking outside. Best let Master decide. Where is she?"

The newcomers scrutinized Guan Yu head-to-toe, their piercing stares making his skin crawl. "Haven't you seen handsome men before?" he snapped. "Your sister asked about your master. I'm in haste—stop delaying me!"

**Chapter 3145: Fortunate Encounter**

The women blinked, recollecting themselves. "Master mentioned you earlier. She awaits in the main hall."

"Let's go then."

As Guan Yu stole glances at cleavage, a rough shove propelled him forward. "Move!"

The main courtyard surpassed other peaks' splendor—fragrant blossoms filled ornamental gardens where passing female disciples whispered behind sleeves. Guan Yu felt like exotic livestock, realizing males seldom visited this sequestered female domain.

In the grand hall, an imposing middle-aged woman sat atop dais steps. Her lavender gauze robe exuded authority, jade-green bracelet contrasting raven tresses. Cold eyes surveyed the assembly like drawn blades.

This must be their master—Convergence Peak's Chief. As his escort passed, delicate fragrance wafted—subtle yet intoxicating. Guan Yu inhaled deeply.

"Master, mission accomplished. This man lurked suspiciously outside. I brought him for your judgment." Her tone softened remarkably from earlier harshness.

Though viewing her back, Guan Yu noted her jade hairpin and alabaster neck. Identical robes couldn't conceal her exceptional grace.

"Lurking near Convergence Peak?" The Chief descended slowly. "Daring to trespass Yunqing Sect. State your purpose."

Ignoring the question, Guan Yu gaped at his surroundings—no males in sight. He'd expected male leadership, but even the Chief was female. What fortune!

When silence lingered, his escort turned coldly. "Master asked you a question! Are you deaf?"

Facing her fully, Guan Yu's breath caught—an unparalleled beauty. Her jade hairpin framed meticulous bangs above charcoal-drawn brows. Porcelain skin, obsidian eyes, and rosebud lips adorned a heart-shaped face. Only lingering melancholy marred perfection.

Guan Yu's gaze locked, sensing profound sorrow beneath her frosty demeanor. He yearned to comfort her, though observers only saw his brazen staring.

Their eyes met—her initial anger softened by Guan Yu's earnest gaze. In his clear pupils, she glimpsed unexpected solace, as if finding an ally beyond her strict master.

"Siqi, did this rogue harm you?" The Chief's voice shattered the moment.

Blinking, Siqi averted her gaze. "No, Master. I held him at swordpoint throughout."

"Well done."

Now knowing her name—Siqi, as lovely as her appearance—Guan Yu cursed himself. Mistaking her sword for firearm! These mountain dwellers probably never saw guns.

Before interrogation, Guan Yu blurted, "Chief, I'm Tigerhead Peak's new disciple under Xuan Ming. Lost my way to Convergence Peak. No offense intended."

"Silver-tongued pup!" The Chief—Dai Qianjie—sneered. "First ogling Siqi, now spinning tales? Our Sect Leader hasn't taken disciples for centuries!"

Guan Yu's heart sank. Dai Qianjie's sharp eyes had noted his Boundary Venerable cultivation earlier. Though Siqi claimed capture, the Chief knew no junior disciple could subdue such power. Hence her cautious approach despite sect rules barring males.

**Chapter 3146: Hidden Motives**

The hall tensed as disciples drew swords hearing "Boundary Venerable." Guan Yu pleaded, "I'm telling truth! Contact Master Xuan Ming! My friends at Front Return Peak—"

"Lies!" Dai Qianjie interrupted. "Ancestral Hall access requires even my approval. You, a newcomer? Preposterous!"

Guan Yu groaned—the harder he tried, the less credible he became. Dai Qianjie's hand shot out, mystical force yanking him airborne by the throat. Bound by Siqi's spell, he hung helpless.

"Master, he might be truthful!" Siqi knelt urgently. "Please verify with Sect Leader first!"

"Defending him?" Dai Qianjie thundered. "My most trusted disciple betraying me?"

"No, Master! I only seek truth!" Siqi kowtowed tearfully.

Guan Yu choked out, "Don't punish her! I'm stranger to her!"

This "defense" worsened suspicions. Dai Qianjie sealed Guan Yu's legs with a gesture, dropping him paralyzed. "Confess your collusion!"

"We're innocent!" Siqi sobbed. "Raised by you since childhood—"

"Then why beg for him? Why his concern for you?" The Chief's voice rose. "Only explanation—you conspired to infiltrate us!"

Guan Yu interjected coldly, "Chief Dai, your paranoia shames you. Bullies always fear shadows."
