Jones’s cultivation was now nearing the Boundary Sovereign realm, and years of hardship in the outside world had imbued him with an air of natural authority. With a faint smile, he said, “Then I won’t stand on ceremony.” While this imposing aura meant little to others, Ah Mei seemed visibly intimidated.

After exchanging a few perfunctory farewells, Liu Shilei, Du Xiaojuan, and Xue Yingfeng prepared to leave. Guanyu stood and asked, “Sisters, why not stay a few more days?”

“Cut it out!” Du Xiaojuan retorted playfully. “A mountain of work is waiting for me at the company. My phone’s been ringing nonstop these past two days. Unlike you, lounging around all day just hitting on girls.”

“Has my issue been resolved?” Guanyu pressed.

“It should be settled. We’ve destroyed the key evidence. Sun Heizi can’t touch you through legal means now. If he resorts to underhanded tactics, you’ll have to handle it yourself.”

Du Xiaojuan stepped forward and patted Guanyu’s shoulder. “I trust your capabilities. Just the fact that you’re the leader of a Boundary Sovereign-level异能者 (supernatural) organization is enough to deal with Sun Heizi. With you as the second-in-command, that wretch doesn’t stand a chance.”

Guanyu was stunned, and Jones looked equally alarmed. How did Du Xiaojuan know such details about Jones’s identity as the organization’s leader—or even Guanyu’s recent promotion? It seemed too far-fetched.

Noticing Guanyu’s bewilderment, Du Xiaojuan said cryptically, “Walls have ears. We’re leaving now.” Even Guanyu couldn’t fathom the full extent of her influence.

As the trio departed, Guanyu wondered, *If I hadn’t lost my memories, what would my life be like now? Would I still be searching for the Primordial Life Sources Xue Jing mentioned? And is that Drifter still watching me?*

Too many questions swirled without answers. Shaking off the thoughts, Guanyu had brought Jones to introduce her to the others and familiarize her with their operations. With little to do that evening, he strolled leisurely to the Flower Night Club.

He intended to ask Hou Jinshun about any leads on Jin Hua, a task he’d also delegated to Jones, instructing her to mobilize her subordinates. If Jin Hua resurfaced, it could unravel the truth of events from over a decade ago—and the secret within Zhang Han.

The club bustled with decent business. By this hour, Qing Linger should have clocked out. Entering the main hall, Hou Jinshun greeted him, “Guanyu! What brings you here today?”

Guanyu found a seat, and Hou Jinshun joined him. “Just passing time. How’s Qing Linger handling her job?”

“Well enough. She stays upstairs managing accounts, while I handle the floor. We barely cross paths.” Hou Jinshun opened a cocktail for him.

Guanyu sipped the drink. “Any news on Jin Hua?”

Hou Jinshun shook his head. “Nothing. It’s been eerily quiet lately.”

“Quiet?”

“Yeah.” Lighting a cigarette, Hou Jinshun continued, “Several regulars—ones who know about the incident years ago—haven’t shown up for days. They used to be here daily.”

Guanyu dismissed it as coincidence. As evening deepened, the club filled with patrons.

Suddenly, a booming voice erupted: “The hell is this swill? Tastes like water!” A middle-aged man spat his drink, face contorted in disgust.

Hou Jinshun and Guanyu turned to see a stocky, bearded man glaring at his glass.

**Chapter 1989: Causing Trouble**

Approaching with a smile, Hou Jinshun asked, “Sir, what seems to be the issue?”

“Your damn club sells fake liquor! This is piss!” The man stood, a head shorter than Hou Jinshun.

“We’ll replace your drink. Please refrain from disturbing others.” Hou Jinshun’s politeness masked years of dealing with troublemakers.

A fresh cocktail was served. The man took a gulp—and spewed it out, narrowly missing Hou Jinshun.

Unfazed, Hou Jinshun suggested, “Perhaps something milder?”

The man sneered. “One more fake drink, and I’ll trash this dump!”

Hou Jinshun returned with a murky green concoction. “This one’s fierce. Best taken in one swig.”

The man obliged—and instantly choked, face flushing green as he spat violently. “Burning! My mouth’s on fire!”

The crowd roared. Guanyu grinned; the “drink” was clearly horseradish mix.

“Seems this was too strong,” Hou Jinshun deadpanned. “Another swap?”

Enraged, the man lunged, but Hou Jinshun—now a seasoned fighter—dodged effortlessly. Coldly, he warned, “Few dare cause trouble at Flower Night. Leave now, or you’ll be carried out.”

When the man kicked a table, brawny security guards materialized. At nearly two meters tall, their mere presence silenced him.

“Touch me, and you’ll regret it! I just wanted to see Miss Yang!” he blustered, confidence waning.

*Crack!* Hou Jinshun smashed a glass on his head. “Throw him out.”

Cheers erupted as guards hauled the bleeding man outside. Hou Jinshun announced, “Apologies for the disruption. All drinks 10% off tonight!”

The crowd cheered. Flower Night’s exorbitant prices made even a 10% discount substantial. Patrons paid premium sums for imported beers, fine wines, and the elusive chance to glimpse Yang Conghan, the club’s legendary owner.

As Hou Jinshun rejoined Guanyu, Yang Conghan descended the staircase. The room hushed, then erupted in applause. Dressed in a sapphire-blue gown with a delicate flower adorning her chest, her porcelain skin and pearl necklace gleamed under the lights.

Spotting Guanyu, she glided toward him. “What brings you here?”

“Catching up with an old friend.”

After Hou Jinshun briefed her on the incident, a crash interrupted them. A man stormed in—Li Zhiming, leader of the Mac gang.

“Who the hell hit my brother?!” he bellowed.

Hou Jinshun eyed the shattered door. “Big Boss Li, you’ll pay for that glass.”

Yang Conghan stepped forward. “We’ve had no quarrel with Mac. Your brother brought this on himself.”

Li Zhiming snarled, “I want justice!”

Yang Conghan called the police. Footage confirmed the brother’s provocation. Officers urged Li Zhiming to drop the matter, but he refused.

Guanyu approached, smirking. “Looking for a workout, Big Boss? Or just bored at Mac?”

**Chapter 1990: Brothers**

The Flower Night Club thrived on its reputation—and Yang Conghan’s allure. Patrons believed glimpsing her celestial beauty brought fortune, as the rhyme went:

*“A goddess descended from heaven, bestowing fortune and wealth with a single glance,
Bringing joy and prosperity to all, where riches and success advance.”*

Tonight, her presence electrified the room. Guanyu, accustomed to her beauty, found himself applauding with the crowd. Her azure gown accentuated her grace, the pearl necklace a testament to her elegance.

As Yang Conghan engaged Guanyu, Li Zhiming’s threat hung in the air. The Mac leader’s brother had been humiliated, and retaliation loomed. Yet in Flower Night, where power and allure intertwined, Guanyu and Yang Conghan stood ready—a Boundary Sovereign and a queen of the night, united against the storm.
