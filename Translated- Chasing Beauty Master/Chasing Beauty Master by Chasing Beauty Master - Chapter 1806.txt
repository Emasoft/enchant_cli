Guan Yu continued, “Has the deputy manor lord I arranged last time returned recently?”

“No,” Elder He replied, his tone noticeably more respectful than before. “It seems the deputy manor lord left shortly after you entered seclusion. There has been no news of him since, nor has he returned.”

Guan Yu nodded in satisfaction. His question had been rhetorical—of course he knew Duteng had not returned. However, Duteng was expected to arrive within the next few days, and Guan Yu was waiting precisely for his return.

“Very well,” Guan Yu declared. “From this moment onward, all significant matters within the manor must be documented in writing and presented to me for review. It seems my recent oversight has led to lax management. Henceforth, I will enforce stricter control. If there is nothing else, you may all withdraw.”

**Chapter 4725: Determined to Leave**

After the others dispersed, Second Elder He remained. Guan Yu regarded him curiously. “Second Elder He, do you have something to discuss?”

Among the three elders of Swordless Villa, Second Elder He managed the fewest affairs. Most responsibilities fell to Elder He and Third Elder He, leaving Second Elder He with little to occupy his time.

“Manor Lord,” Second Elder He began, bowing deeply, “I have a request. As I serve little purpose here and find myself idle, I ask permission to leave the mountain. I wish to wander the jianghu for some years. Having reached my sixtieth year, I’ve spent decades within Swordless Villa and have not descended the mountain in many years. Before my death, I desire to roam the world and unburden my heart.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Second Elder He, has something troubled you here? This villa is a place of peace where you may enjoy your twilight years. Why subject yourself to the hardships of the jianghu?”

“I implore you to grant my request,” Second Elder He insisted, his voice firm.

Swordless Villa lacked nothing. Nestled in a picturesque location alive with birdsong and blossoms, few who entered ever wished to leave. Though Second Elder He had contributed much over the years, his duties had been light. The villa offered comfort and security, far preferable to the uncertainties of the jianghu—especially for a man of his age.

Guan Yu sensed an unspoken reason behind this sudden request. Earlier, only Second Elder He had remained silent while the other two elders spoke. Had conflicts arisen between them? Yet the three elders had long been pillars of Swordless Villa, renowned martial experts who coexisted harmoniously. They managed separate affairs, avoiding entanglement. What discord could have emerged?

“Second Elder,” Guan Yu pressed, “is there another reason for your departure?”

“There is none,” the elder replied. “I seek only to fulfill a final wish.”

Guan Yu sighed. “Though reluctant to see you go, I cannot force you to stay. Should you grow weary of wandering, know that Swordless Villa’s gates remain open to you.”

**Chapter 4726: The True Reason**

After the others left, Guan Yu returned to the mountain cavern’s secret chamber, where Wang Jun tirelessly sifted through treasures. “We may need to stay here several days,” Guan Yu remarked. “I await someone’s arrival.”

Wang Jun approached. “This is Swordless Villa, isn’t it? You’re posing as the Swordless Immortal—hence the mask. Where is the true Swordless Immortal? Countless challengers await at the foot of the mountain. Aren’t you afraid of exposure?”

“Posing?” Guan Yu removed his mask, smiling. “There is no pretense. I *am* the Swordless Immortal. Let challengers come.”

“Stop jesting,” Wang Jun retorted. “Where is the real one?”

Guan Yu grew solemn. “Does my guise falter? The villa’s elders already suspect me. As for the true Swordless Immortal…” He gestured to a skeletal remains in the chamber’s corner. “He likely perished long ago.”

Wang Jun inspected the bones. “This skeleton has decayed here for at least a decade. You claim this is the Swordless Immortal?”

“Lower your voice,” Guan Yu chided. “This man was indeed the Swordless Immortal, though I cannot say when or how he died. The legend of his undefeated prowess drew endless challengers. Victors were compelled to leave their martial secrets, enriching these walls. Over time, the title became a mantle passed between conquerors. Each successor, enticed by these treasures and techniques, assumed the mask and name.”

Wang Jun’s eyes widened in understanding. “So the Swordless Immortal is not a person, but a role claimed by those who defeat the previous holder. The victor inherits everything—including the legend.”

“Precisely,” Guan Yu affirmed. “Thus, I am no impostor. Through countless cycles, the fiction has become truth.”

**Chapter 4727: Trusted**

The next day, Duteng arrived. “I came swiftly upon your summons,” he said. “What requires my aid amidst such riches?”

Guan Yu led him to the chamber. “A friend’s faction plans to relocate to Red Mountain. They require funds—silver transported discreetly and repeatedly. Only you can undertake this task.”

Duteng chuckled. “You trust me not to embezzle these fortunes?”

“Take what you wish,” Guan Yu replied, handing him the Swordless Immortal’s token. “I’ve faith in your honor.”

After arrangements were made, Guan Yu and Wang Jun returned to Cloud Azure Sect. Unbeknownst to them, Chief Zheng had finalized his son Xiao Zhi’s wedding to Du Bingyan—scheduled in four days, coinciding with Zheng’s own anniversary.

As preparations engulfed Cloud Azure Sect, Wang Jun marveled at their haul. Though tempted by more treasures, he heeded Guan Yu’s advice: *“Gluttony dulls appetite. Cherish what you’ve claimed.”*

Time flowed swiftly. On the eve of the wedding, Du Bingyan would depart from Tiger’s Peak—her bridal procession—while Xiao Zhi journeyed from Hanging Bell Peak to greet his bride. The stage was set, the villa’s secrets buried beneath ceremony, and the legacy of the Swordless Immortal continued its eternal dance.
