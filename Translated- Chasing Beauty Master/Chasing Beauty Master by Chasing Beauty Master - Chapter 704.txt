“Good heavens, this little chili pepper’s temper flares up so unpredictably. She’s hard to handle,” Guanyu mused, deftly steering the conversation away. “By the way, today’s drink is exceptionally good. Try it if you don’t believe me.” He handed the beverage bottle to Lü Mei.

Lü Mei flushed with embarrassment. That indirect kiss earlier had been her first. Since childhood, she’d refused even her parents’ kisses. Yet today, her carefully preserved lips had been casually claimed.

“Fine, I’ll drink! Who’s scared?” True to her fiery nature, she took a sip. What difference did it make now? One kiss or two—the damage was done.

Beyond her shyness, sweetness bloomed in Lü Mei’s heart. Uncle Wang’s parting words echoed within her. Unconsciously, she’d grown fond of this boy beside her.

In a corner of the schoolyard, a group of students puffed vigorously at cigarettes.

“Young Master Chen, the investigation into Guanyu hasn’t yielded much yet. I need more time. But rumors say he’s connected. Xue Jing from Class Six—that little enchantress—is his girlfriend. Just her alone is trouble. Few dare cross her,” reported a yellow-haired youth.

Among the smokers, Chen Maosheng appeared relatively normal compared to his motley crew—dyed hair, ripped jeans, sleeveless shirts—a pack of riffraff.

“Damn it! Since when does this nobody think he can steal my woman? He’s begging for death!” Chen Maosheng crushed his cigarette underfoot.

“Young Master Chen, best tread carefully until we know more. Bide your time.”

“Hmph! What powerful connections could he have? In City A, I know every heavyweight. He’s just some upstart. My father’s resources could squash him like a bug.” Chen Maosheng itched to drag Guanyu here and stomp him into pulp.

“Exactly! Who in City A dares oppose you? Lü Mei was practically your betrothed. Now this bastard interferes,” a red-haired sycophant added.

That evening, Guanyu rode shotgun in Xue Jing’s red sports car. “Take me to Friendship Mall. I need to shop.”

Xue Jing’s eyes narrowed. The mall sold luxury goods—not Guanyu’s usual haunt. Suddenly, she understood.

“Buying gifts for Lü Mei?” she pouted. “You spendthrift! With a beauty like me by your side, you’re still chasing others? Known her days and already splurging? We’ve been together ages—where’s my gift?”

Guanyu stayed silent. Too-clever women were troublesome—they saw through everything.

“The whole school knows I’m your girlfriend. How does it look when you parade another girl so soon? Where’s my face as the campus enchantress?”

“If you won’t drive me, I’ll tell my sisters. They dote on me, you know,” Guanyu threatened, referring to his former wives who now posed as doting siblings—all except Xue Jing, his “official” girlfriend.

Xue Jing’s mouth twisted. Her tantrums never worked on him. Between his harem at home and new conquests abroad, this amnesiac playboy remained unstoppable.

Why did heaven bless this wastrel with all the beauties?

“Jingjing, what’s good for a first gift?” Guanyu pressed.

Xue Jing sighed, swallowing her jealousy. When Guanyu lost his memory, the other “wives” volunteered as sisters while pushing her into the girlfriend role. She’d dreamed of having him to herself—until this latest entanglement.

“Either a phone or a ladies’ watch. Both work.”

“Perfect. We’ll get both.”

**Chapter 1789: The Mole-Faced Brute**

At Friendship Mall, Guanyu relied entirely on Xue Jing’s taste. Reluctantly, she selected an exorbitant watch—neither cared about cost.

Exiting, Xue Jing grumbled, “I’m billing your sisters for this. Feeding you, housing you, schooling you, funding your romances—what cosmic debt do I owe?”

Guanyu shrugged. “Complain to them. I’m broke.”

Next noon, Guanyu repeated his tactic. “Wei Ge, reserve tables at Grand Rich Hotel again.”

“On it! Following you’s always a feast!” Wei Hongwei scampered off.

Guanyu aimed to bring Lü Mei and present yesterday’s gifts. “Lü Mei, join us? The drinks won’t taste right without you.”

Her heart raced—this boy had stormed her defenses. When Guanyu reached for her hand, she flinched but couldn’t escape his grasp.

“Come! Surprises await,” he declared, tugging her along.

At the classroom door, Uncle Wang appeared. “Young Mistress, your destination?”

“Uncle Wang, I’m taking Lü Mei to lunch. Her safety’s guaranteed.”

The bodyguard nodded approval. “If the Young Mistress agrees, I’ve no objection. But any harm befalls her, the Lü family will hunt you down.”

Guanyu led Lü Mei past, her delicate hand in his, face crimson as a blushing bride. Across campus, envious stares followed.

Outside school gates, five burly men surrounded them. Lü Mei gripped Guanyu’s arm, terrified.

“Stay behind me,” Guanyu soothed, pushing her protectively. To the mole-faced leader, he smirked, “How about I pluck that ugly wart?”

“You’re dead!” The brute charged. Fists collided—CRACK!—the thug collapsed, howling over his shattered hand.

“Kill him!” the leader screamed. Others drew daggers.

Guanyu lunged, disarming one attacker. In the blur, the gang inexplicably stabbed each other. Bystanders gaped as Guanyu reappeared beside Lü Mei, unharmed.

Sirens wailed. Police took statements but left after Guanyu declined prosecution. Uncle Wang approached, impressed. “My judgment holds—you’re extraordinary.”

Wei Hongwei reappeared, whining about hunger. At Grand Rich Hotel’s private room, they found Wei’s new girlfriend Wang Xiaoqian—a recent rescue from assailants.

“Meet my girl—your sister-in-law!” Wei announced.

Guanyu grinned. “A brother’s wife is family indeed!”

Laughter erupted. As lunch progressed, Wang Xiaoqian’s ordeal emerged—Wei had saved her from attackers days prior. The feast continued, tensions momentarily forgotten.
