“You little punk, I didn’t expect you to be this capable. But you’d better never use that dark attack again. Dark magic not only devours others—if mishandled, it can backlash and destroy you both in mutual annihilation.”

“Understood. I had no choice earlier! Now you handle those two black-clad men—leave their leader to me!”

“Haha! Spirited! The young should have such mettle!”

As Guan Yu and Shituo prepared themselves, laughter suddenly rang out behind them.

“Hahaha! Seems I’ve missed quite the spectacle!”

Turning, Guan Yu saw Elder Kyle approaching.

“Elder Kyle! Save us!” Amy cried upon seeing him.

Yet Kyle appeared deaf to her plea. Scanning the surroundings with a furrowed brow, he strode toward Guan Yu. “As a guest of the elves, you bring Miss Amy to stir trouble near the Elvenwoods? This only deepens the rift between elves and humans!”

Seeing Kyle’s immediate condemnation without inquiry, Guan Yu realized the elder had likely observed the entire conflict. His intervention now could drastically sway the battle’s outcome.

“Captain Wei, how have they offended you? I’ll report to the Chieftain for strict discipline. We’ll compensate your Blackwater Mercenaries’ losses.”

Watching Kyle’s sycophantic display, Guan Yu nearly retched. He became certain—Kyle and this “Captain Wei” shared secrets.

Chapter 1316: Wei Buqun

Contrary to expectations, Captain Wei coldly sneered at Kyle’s offer: “Compensation? You speak lightly! How will you repay my brothers’ lives?”

“Well...” Kyle feigned distress. “As the saying goes—every debt has its debtor. This matter concerns not the elves. Shouldn’t you confront whoever slaughtered your men?”

“Who else but this whelp? Only his blood will quench my hatred!”

“Brother Guan Yu, how could you indiscriminately slaughter Blackwater members? When this spreads, what will outsiders think? It’ll worsen human-elf relations!”

Sighing theatrically, Kyle suddenly exclaimed as if struck by inspiration: “Captain Wei, regardless, Guan Yu remains our friend. Could you spare him for my sake—”

“Spare him? ‘A life for a life, a debt repaid in blood.’ No one’s面子 (face) matters today—he dies!”

“Hah! Knew the spear would point at me eventually.” Guan Yu laughed coldly at their act. “Why not drop the charade? Your acting’s terrible.”

“You...” Kyle’s beard quivered with rage. “Ungrateful wretch! I try saving you, yet you bite the hand? How heartbreaking!”

“See, Brother Kyle? This obstinate fool’s beyond redemption. Left alive, he’ll become a scourge upon all.”

“Enough! Fight if you’ll fight! Two grown men gossiping like fishwives—where’s your shame? That grand slanderous帽子 (hat) you’ve stuck on me? I can’t bear its weight!”

“Fine! Since you court death, I’ll oblige. Don’t blame others for not saving you later!”

“Wait!” Shituo leaped between them as Guan Yu prepared to engage Wei Buqun.

“You? Still alive?” Kyle started upon seeing Shituo.

Puzzled by Kyle’s reaction, Shituo recalled leaving the Elvenwoods decades ago when Kyle and Chieftain Allen were young. Their only interaction had been during the chieftain election when he supported Allen.

Unknown to others, Amy knew Kyle had blocked her father from aiding the beastkin race. Without their obstruction, Uncle Shituo wouldn’t have left, elf-beastkin relations would thrive, and most importantly—her mother might still live.

Though young, Amy remembered every wrongdoer. These debts would be collected.

“Why shouldn’t I live?” Shituo’s expression darkened at Kyle’s question.

Realizing his slip, Kyle backtracked: “No offense—merely surprised. Hasn’t it been decades? Many missed you after your departure.”

“Truly?” Shituo doubted. During his stay, only Allen’s faction welcomed him. Others were indifferent or hostile. Without Allen’s protection, he’d have left immediately.

The awkward silence broke when Kyle asked: “What brings you to the Elvenwoods now?”

“Merely visiting old friends. Unwelcome?”

“Nonsense! Welcome indeed! Let me inform the Chieftain for proper reception—” Kyle turned to leave but Shituo blocked him.

“Since returning anyway, let’s go together. Why stand on ceremony?”

“But...” Kyle’s eyes darted to Wei Buqun, silently pleading: What now?

Surprisingly, Wei nodded: “Take the girl. He only killed my underlings—let it pass.”

“And him?” Kyle pointed at Guan Yu.

“Him? He doesn’t leave today. Blood demands blood.”

“Meanies! Don’t bully my Dragonkin Brother!” Amy spread her arms protectively before Guan Yu. “Kill him over my dead body!”

Seeing Amy’s defiance, Wei glared at Kyle: “Remove her in five seconds, or I’ll eliminate her first.”

“Miss Amy, cease this folly! Come away!”

“No! I stay with Dragonkin Brother!”

Kyle sighed: “He’s beyond redemption. Staying means death!”

“I don’t care! He killed bad people! Should we’ve let them kill us? Coward—flee alone if scared!”

Chapter 1317: Sword Control Technique

“You...” Kyle’s beard bristled. “Youth today know no gratitude!”

Meanwhile, Wei’s patience expired. Murderous intent coalesced in his eyes.

“Have it your way!”

Wei summoned a three-foot sword—Xuanhei Blade, a premium earth-grade weapon crafted by masters, exceptional in material and workmanship.

“Fine blade,” Guan Yu mused, eyeing potential spoils. Had Wei known his prey considered him prey, rage would’ve overwhelmed him.

Noticing Guan Yu’s gaze, Wei sneered: “Trembling? Submit now for a quick death.”

“Haha! Bring it!” Guan Yu pulled Amy behind him, purple energy wreathing his form.

“Impressive. Had you not killed my men, I’d admire such talent. Too late now.”

“Spare me your admiration, dwarf! Let’s see what a Sword King’s worth—don’t embarrass yourself!”

As Guan Yu spoke, Wei’s blade thrust forward. Guan Yu tried dodging but found himself immobilized.

“What sorcery?!”

Bracing defensively, Guan Yu realized: This runt surpasses those Grand Swordmasters. A Sword King’s reputation holds truth—he’d ensnared me mid-conversation!

“Haha! Where’s your arrogance now? Die!”

As the blade neared Guan Yu’s skull, Shituo leaped to aid—only to be blocked by two Grand Swordmasters.

At the critical moment, Guan Yu’s form erupted upward, exploding the ground beneath.

Relieved by Guan Yu’s escape, Shituo focused on his opponents—two Grand Swordmasters matching his prowess.

“Hmph! Surviving my Soul-Devouring Curse? Excellent! You’ve ignited my battle-lust—let’s play properly!”

“Unleash everything! I’ll dismantle it all!”

Wei chanted, his sword levitating.

“Sword Control Technique?!” Shituo exclaimed. This advanced skill required immense aura control and a premium blade—minimum earth-grade.

“Sounds impressive...” Guan Yu mused, undaunted. Facing a true expert might prove instructive.

Wei now stood meditative, Xuanhei Blade quivering overhead like a hungry predator.

Guan Yu watched warily, defenses heightened.

Suddenly, Wei’s eyes snapped open: “Have at you!”

The blade shot forth like a loosed beast. Guan Yu dodged easily. “Overhyped trick—”

Before he finished, the sword struck again with uncanny precision.

“Persistent pest!” Repeated dodges revealed the technique’s danger—continuous precise strikes exhausting the target. “Can’t keep dodging!”

Noticing Wei controlling the blade eyes-closed, Guan Yu smirked. “Cut the puppet strings!”

Luring the blade behind Wei, Guan Yu roared: “Gale Slash!”

A blue wind-blade shot at Wei, who hastily chanted, recalling Xuanhei to block.

“Lucky escape! Next time—” Guan Yu glanced at Shituo, who’d downed one Grand Swordmaster and pressed the other. “Three minutes till he’s free. I need time!”

Chapter 1318: Critical Moment

Guan Yu grimaced—this defensive battle favored Wei. Any mistake meant death. He needed strategy.

Wei sneered: “Awaiting rescue? I’ll end this swiftly!”

“Strike!” The reinvigorated Xuanhei attacked fiercer than ever, each thrust lethal.

Guan Yu countered with earth-grade skills, deflecting the blade momentarily before it resumed assault.

“Damned nuisance!” As frustration mounted, a scream pierced the air.

Wei clutched his bleeding neck—Amy stood behind him, dagger in hand.

“Dragonkin Brother! Now!”

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu roared: “Gathering Qi into Blades!”
