Finally, whether due to toxin发作 or physical collapse, Guan Yu collapsed limply to the ground.

Chapter 373: Released

"Brother, brother..."

A crisp, melodious voice tinged with tears reached Guan Yu's ears. Struggling to open eyes that felt weighed down by thousand-pound lids, he glimpsed only boundless whiteness through his haze before sinking back into unconsciousness.

After what felt like eternity, Guan Yu mustered enough strength to open his eyes. His right hand lay clasped within a pair of soft, boneless little palms.

Seeing him awaken, the girl exclaimed with tearful joy, "Brother! You're awake! Thank goodness! I thought I'd never see you again!"

Turning his head, Guan Yu beheld a stunning tear-streaked face - heart-shaped with dewy translucent skin, her fragile appearance more gaunt than days prior, evoking heartbreaking tenderness.

With great effort, Guan Yu raised his right hand to wipe Zhao Jinger's tears. "Who dared upset our Jing'er? I'll teach them a lesson."

Her tears transforming into laughter, Zhao Jinger pouted, "You're the one who made me worry! When I heard you were dying, my heart nearly broke!"

"How could I bear to leave such an adorable Jing'er? Your brother's life is charmed." Guan Yu smiled weakly.

Nodding vigorously, Zhao Jinger grasped his hand anew. "I couldn't bear losing you either. Promise you'll protect yourself."

"Where am I?"

"N City First People's Hospital." Her sweet smile mirrored her lifted spirits.

Guan Yu frowned. "Wasn't I in detention? Are police guarding outside?"

Zhao Jinger's delicate nose wrinkled. "Grandfather took until today to get you released! If he'd delayed longer..." Her eyes reddened again as voice trailed off.

The door swung open, revealing a square-jawed middle-aged man with stern features. Having caught her complaint, he sighed, "Jing'er, don't blame your grandfather. Securing Guan Yu's release today required immense effort from the Old Commander. He considers not just Guan Yu, but your treatment too."

Zhao Jinger hmphed, turning away. Fang Zhe shook his head wryly - within days, this boy had surpassed her grandfather's importance.

Recognizing the Old Commander's chief guard, Guan Yu struggled upright. "Thank you, and please convey my gratitude to the Old Commander. I'll personally express-"

Fang Zhe waved him off. "I've watched Jing'er grow like my own daughter. Call me Uncle Fang. Since you've stolen her heart, consider us family."

Blushing crimson, Zhao Jinger glared. "Uncle Fang! What nonsense!"

Guan Yu awkwardly cleared his throat. "Uncle Fang... was my cellmate released too?"

"Of course."

Relief washed over Guan Yu, earning Fang Zhe's approving nod.

"He's in the next room with knee injuries needing rest," Zhao Jinger interjected. Guan Yu nodded, already planning to heal Niu Le's wounds after recovering.

Fang Zhe chuckled. "You leave chaos wherever you go - assaulting police, surviving viper bites after doctors gave up... Remarkable."

Guan Yu shrugged. "Those officers were lawless. I regret not hitting harder."

"Harder? You broke two ribs! They're hospitalized too!" Fang Zhe pointed accusingly, though amusement glinted in his eyes.

"Serves them right."

Fang Zhe's expression sobered. "A mere deputy chief recklessly firing his weapon? We've stripped his position and jailed him. Justice is served."

"Should've been executed!" Zhao Jinger clenched petite fists. Her rare fury had accelerated the official's downfall.

Observing her flushed cheeks, Guan Yu stroked her hair. "After resting tomorrow, I'll resume your treatment."

At mention of treatment, Zhao Jinger's face reddened anew, recalling how his healing touch had... amplified certain curves, making her bras uncomfortably tight.

Noticing their intimacy, Fang Zhe tactfully withdrew. "I'll report to the Commander. Rest well these days. We'll handle remaining matters."

"Wait!" Guan Yu called. "There's Xiao Xiong, jailed for offending the governor. Could you...?"

"I'll try." Fang Zhe's immediate agreement surprised Guan Yu.

"Thank you, Uncle Fang!"

Chapter 374: Promise

Tilting her head, Zhao Jinger blinked curiously. Guan Yu explained, "A brother I met inside."

"Quite the eventful two days!" She giggled.

Changing subject, Guan Yu asked, "Why are you alone here?"

"Should I have brought everyone?" Her knowing smile made him flush. He missed his villa's ladies, yet dreaded their clashes - especially Wen Qing's unapproved status.

"Feng Xin likely knows you're out." Zhao Jinger's comment stirred Guan Yu's memories of holding the formidable businesswoman tenderly...

Noticing his dreamy expression, Zhao Jinger fought unexpected jealousy before mentally chiding herself to be happy for him.

Observing her pallor, Guan Yu murmured, "You've lost weight without my cooking. It pains me."

"Then fatten me up again!" The double entendre struck her belatedly, cheeks blooming anew.

Guan Yu caressed her porcelain cheek. "I'll make you plump and rosy."

Yet his current weakness frustrated him. Attempting to activate his detection system proved futile - the bronze coin in his mind remained dormant. Energy depletion required urgent replenishment.

Electric charging! But how to reach outlets undetected? And needing to wait until mobility returned...

Breaking the silence, Guan Yu asked about her school life. Her bright reply - "So much better than sickbed isolation!" - stabbed his heart.

Squeezing her hand, he vowed, "After curing you, we'll tour the world."

"Really?!" Her eyes sparkled.

"Have I ever lied?"

Overcome, she threw arms around his neck, breasts pressing against him. Her natural fragrance and softness stirred dangerous impulses...

When lips accidentally brushed her cheek, then met hers, passion ignited. His exploring tongue and wandering hands elicited soft moans before she jolted upright, scarlet-faced.

"I... need the bathroom!" Fleeing, she berated herself through the mirror - not angry at him, but mortified by her response.

Returning sheepishly, she sat like a chastened child. Guan Yu chuckled at her adorable awkwardness.

Chapter 375: Suffering in Repression

Innocent as blank paper, Zhao Jinger had surrendered completely to Guan Yu's guidance. His right hand lingered over her sweater-clad peaks, teasing buds to hardness until her soft gasp broke the spell.

Meeting his gaze, she gasped and sprang up, flushed and panting. Guan Yu licked lips回味ing the taste, pulse racing with equal parts guilt and thrill.

Beast! She's your sister! his conscience screamed. But... not by blood, argued temptation.

"Jing'er, about earlier..."

"Bathroom!" She fled again, leaning against the door while stomping feet. "So embarrassing! What must he think?!"

Emerging eventually, she avoided eye contact, sitting demurely. Guan Yu's heart melted at her innocence.
