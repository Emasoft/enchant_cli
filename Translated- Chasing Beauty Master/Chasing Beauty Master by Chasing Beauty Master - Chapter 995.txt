Guan Yu explained, “After the aunt screamed, we all rushed in, wanting to see what had happened. But none of us realized the killer was hiding behind the bathroom door at that moment.”

“Exactly,” Xue Jing continued. “When the aunt came for the last time and found the bathroom door unlocked, yet no one noticed the killer leaving, it proved they’d never left the bathroom. The killer hid behind the door while the aunt began cleaning!”

Her words sent chills down everyone’s spines. In their haste to investigate after hearing the scream, no one had noticed the lurking figure.

Thus, the killer had remained inside. Amidst the chaos of everyone rushing in, the killer pretended to arrive belatedly and slipped out unnoticed. This explained why no one saw the killer exit.

“And that killer,” Guan Yu declared sharply, “is you—Feng Guangjun!”

Shocked expressions spread across the room. No one could believe their seasoned colleague Feng Guangjun was the murderer.

Feng Guangjun had always been on excellent terms with Hou Jinshun, who trusted him deeply and delegated many responsibilities. This gave Feng considerable influence at the Flower Night Club.

Though stunned by the accusation, Hou Jinshun trusted Guan Yu’s judgment. “A-Jun…is it really you? Why?” he asked bitterly.

Feng Guangjun’s face twisted. “These are just baseless accusations! Where’s your proof?” he retorted. Indeed, Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s case rested on speculation.

Xue Jing countered, “After Xiao Qi started working here, you became infatuated with her. Though she agreed to date you, she remained chaste. You tried repeatedly to push her boundaries but failed. Yet you saw this as proof of her virtue.”

**Chapter 2544: The Truth of the Matter**

Guan Yu narrated, “Let me tell a story everyone here knows. Cui Li often mocked Feng for failing to ‘conquer’ Xiao Qi. But Feng believed she’d eventually yield willingly. His pride in having her as his girlfriend grew, especially after gaining Hou Jinshun’s favor.

However, when the handsome Deng Chaowen joined the club, he set his sights on Xiao Qi. Despite warnings that she was Feng’s girl, Deng learned Feng had never truly possessed her. Viewing her as a challenge, Deng resolved to steal Xiao Qi and humiliate Feng.

At first, Feng dismissed Deng’s efforts. But as Deng relentlessly pursued Xiao Qi with gifts and invitations—all rejected—Feng mocked Deng’s arrogance.

One night, after Hou Jinshun sent Feng on an errand, he returned to find Xiao Qi and Deng whispering in a corner. Enraged, Feng confronted them, but Deng taunted him about their ‘private conversation.’

Today, Feng messaged Xiao Qi demanding answers. Her vague replies fueled his suspicions. He summoned her to the bathroom, where they argued fiercely. Convinced she was hiding an affair, Feng tried to force himself on her.

When the cleaning aunt knocked, Feng silenced Xiao Qi. After the aunt left, he pinned her to a toilet, tearing at her clothes. As Xiao Qi threatened to scream, he choked her with one hand while clutching a phone. In his frenzy, he accidentally crushed her windpipe.

Hearing the aunt’s second knock, Feng panicked. He hid behind the door, emerging unnoticed during the commotion. After disposing of their phones, he blended into the crowd.”

“A compelling tale,” Feng sneered, “but I was fetching steak in the kitchen. I couldn’t have been there.”

Guan Yu retorted, “The kitchen staff confirmed you fetched the order over an hour ago. You had ample time.”

**Chapter 2545: It’s All My Fault**

“Where’s your evidence?” Feng demanded. “A story doesn’t prove murder! Yes, we had issues, but I’d never kill her!”

Xue Jing said, “Everyone else’s alibis hold. You killed her in a moment of madness. Confess, and we’ll plead for leniency.”

“No evidence means no guilt!” Feng insisted.

Guan Yu stepped forward. “You want proof? Xiao Qi’s phone never left this room. A large-screen device can’t be flushed. It’s still on you!”

Hou Jinshun interjected mournfully, “A-Jun, if you have her phone, surrender it. Guan Yu won’t relent.”

Defeated, Feng produced the phone. “It was an accident…I never meant…” He collapsed, weeping.

Hou Jinshun shook his head. Though Feng was a trusted subordinate, murder couldn’t be ignored. “The police will handle this,” Guan Yu said before leaving to meet Second Only to Wolf.

Outside, the mercenary teased, “Playing detective? How noble.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “You’re late.”

Xue Jing smirked at Second Only to Wolf. “Should I tell Sakurako how you complain about helping?”

He grimaced. “Must you weaponize my wife?”

As Hou Jinshun approached with wine, Guan Yu advised keeping the incident quiet. After he left, Second Only to Wolf snorted, “Meddling again. You’ll bring trouble.”

**Chapter 2546: Repercussions**

Hou Jinshun later examined Xiao Qi’s phone, confirming Feng’s guilt. Alone with Feng, he vowed, “I’ll help you.”

“Can you really?” Feng begged.

“We’ll bribe the police,” Hou Jinshun murmured. Though uneasy, Feng agreed.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu reflected that exposing Feng might harm the club. Yet justice demanded accountability.

When Second Only to Wolf mocked his idealism, Xue Jing retorted, “At least he cares. Unlike some.”

As the trio bickered, Hou Jinshun returned, having alerted the authorities. Guan Yu departed, knowing the fallout would test the club’s future—and Hou Jinshun’s loyalty.
