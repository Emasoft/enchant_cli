The daughter of Qin Lao Ye (Old Master Qin), who was also Qin Huan’s elder sister, had become one of the Second Prince’s imperial consorts and held considerable status and power within his residence.

Several years prior, leveraging the Qin family’s influence and connections in the capital, Qin Lao Ye had forcibly married his daughter to the Second Prince to further their ambitions. At the time, the Second Prince was several years younger than Qin Lao Ye’s daughter, yet she ultimately became his principal consort, wielding immense authority.

Chancellor Li remarked, “Second Prince, while Cao Lao Ye (Old Master Cao) acts with reckless disregard for consequences, we must not allow his actions to implicate us. If His Majesty were to involve us in this matter due to his transgressions, it would be a grave injustice.”

“What do you propose now? That I plead for mercy? Abandon such thoughts. I cannot utter a single word in His Majesty’s presence—there is no recourse,” the Second Prince replied. “Await further news and tread carefully.”

The Second Prince knew the situation was dire. Not only Cao Lao Ye’s daughters but even the Qin family might be dragged into this quagmire.

Chancellor Li continued, “This Cao Lao Ye is utterly audacious. His actions have implicated half the capital. If His Majesty truly orders the extermination of nine clans, none will escape—even I, as chancellor, may face calamity.”

“This is indeed possible,” the Second Prince agreed. “His Majesty, advanced in years, has long sought to weaken the capital’s powerful factions. Cao Lao Ye’s self-destructive folly at this critical juncture provides the perfect pretext for His Majesty to eradicate multiple major forces, thereby stabilizing the capital.”

He added, “Given His Majesty’s temperament, only by seizing the initiative and controlling the broader situation can he tighten his grip on those around him. This affair allows him to eliminate all latent threats.”

“Ah, this bodes ill,” Chancellor Li fretted. “Second Prince, do you think His Majesty might use this as an excuse to reclaim command of the Imperial Palace Guard from me? I’ve heard he has long contemplated this.”

This remark jolted the Second Prince. Indeed, this was no trivial matter.

The Imperial Palace Guard had originally been overseen by a Grand Commander. After his downfall, during the peak of the Second Prince’s influence—when half the court bowed to his will—the guard’s authority had been thrust into Chancellor Li’s hands through relentless lobbying by officials.

His Majesty, under immense pressure, had reluctantly agreed, declaring it a “temporary stewardship” by Chancellor Li. Yet this arrangement had persisted to the present.

All knew Chancellor Li and the Second Prince were allies. The Imperial Palace Guard under Chancellor Li’s control might as well have been under the Second Prince’s direct command. Over the years, the pair had accomplished much through this force.

“You are correct—this is grave. We must devise a solution,” the Second Prince said.

Encouraged, Chancellor Li pressed, “The Imperial Palace Guard is our pillar. Without it, we lose our leverage against the Eldest Prince, who commands Yu Kong’s elite troops. We cannot afford complacency.”

“The Eldest Prince’s recent heroic rescue has earned him great merit. If His Majesty strips us of the guard now, he will likely hand it to the Eldest Prince. Then, our days will grow bleak.”

“True,” the Second Prince conceded. “But His Majesty scowls at the mere sight of me. I dare not provoke him further. Yet we must act to regain his favor.”

After a pause, Chancellor Li brightened. “Second Prince, I have an idea. Let us present His Majesty with a gift he will cherish.”

As the Second Prince waited expectantly, Chancellor Li elaborated, “Recently, I obtained a rare white stone of unknown origin. Its surface bears golden veins that naturally form the characters ‘Longevity Rivaling Heaven.’ Remarkably, the uncarved stone measures nearly two meters and resembles a crown. I had intended to gift it to you, but offering it to His Majesty now might secure our safety.”

“Intriguing. Have it brought for my inspection,” the Second Prince ordered.

“At once. But let us deliver it to the palace today,” Chancellor Li urged.

“Easier said than done. His Majesty refuses audiences. Even with such a treasure, gaining access is no simple task,” the Second Prince countered.

“I have another idea—a last resort,” he continued. “His Majesty dotes excessively on Princess Jiangxin. While others find him unyielding, he softens for the Eldest Princess and her daughter. If we secure the Eldest Princess’s intercession, she might persuade His Majesty to show mercy, potentially sparing even the Cao family.”

**Chapter 4939: Words Must Not Be Spoken Recklessly**

“This is too difficult,” Chancellor Li sighed. “The Eldest Princess’s household avoids all factional ties. Infiltrating it is impossible. As for the Cao family… when their confiscation comes, the Eldest Prince will reap their riches. A enviable prize indeed.”

“Focus on protecting ourselves and the Imperial Palace Guard,” the Second Prince chided. “Your ambitions overreach.”

Reluctant to part with the white stone yet finding merit in the plan, Chancellor Li mused, “Let us proceed step by step. Second Prince, as the Eldest Princess’s royal brother, could you not appeal to her directly?”

At that moment, Qin Lao Ye’s daughter—the Second Prince’s principal consort—emerged from the rear courtyard.

“Greetings, Imperial Consort,” Chancellor Li bowed.

“Rise, Chancellor Li,” she said. “I overheard your discussion of the Cao matter. Has the Qin family’s peril left you leisure to meddle further?”

“My younger brother pleads for aid,” the Imperial Consort explained. “I seek your assistance.”

“I have no solutions,” the Second Prince deflected.

The Imperial Consort pressed, “Chancellor Li’s counsel is sound. As siblings, your entreaty might move the Eldest Princess.”

“I refuse,” the Second Prince snapped. “That formidable woman is beyond my approach.”

Chancellor Li concurred, “The Eldest Princess surely rages over her child’s endangerment. Persuasion now is unlikely.”

“Enough. Chancellor Li, fetch the white stone. We shall present it to His Majesty today,” the Second Prince commanded.

After Chancellor Li departed, the Imperial Consort warned, “Though the Qin family escapes implication for now, Cao Lao Ye’s eventual testimony could doom us all—including you, Second Prince.”

“Do you imply the Qins colluded with the Caos?” the Second Prince demanded. “Such words, if overheard, would destroy your clan!”

“I cannot say,” she evaded. “But Cao Lao Ye frequented our household. Should evidence emerge…”

“What do you propose?”

“Cao Lao Ye must die swiftly. His death ends all threats,” she declared.

The Second Prince’s eyes gleamed. “Precisely! With him gone, stability returns.”

“His Majesty delays trial to unnerve us into error,” the Imperial Consort analyzed. “Killing Cao Lao Ye in custody resolves everything.”

“But he’s confined in the Heavenly Prison. Am I to storm it? His sudden death would raise suspicion.”

“The Imperial Guard!” she exclaimed. “Magistrate Qi’s men frequent the prison. They could stage his suicide.”

“Brilliant!” the Second Prince cried. “Summon Magistrate Qi!”

When Magistrate Qi arrived, the Second Prince ordered, “Have your guards eliminate Cao Lao Ye discreetly. Make it appear self-inflicted.”

Though uneasy, Magistrate Qi acquiesced. “It shall be done.”

As Magistrate Qi left, Chancellor Li returned with the white stone. Marveling at its splendor, the Second Prince declared, “We depart for the palace at once!”

Meanwhile, Emperor Hongzhi deliberated with General Yu Kong. “Without evidence against the Qins, we cannot act rashly,” Yu Kong cautioned.

“Evidence will surface,” the emperor vowed. “The Qins’ decades of schemes cannot be flawless. When it emerges—combined with Cao Lao Ye’s testimony—their doom is sealed.”

**Chapter 4940: Such Stupidity**

“You don’t know?” the Second Prince berated Magistrate Qi. “How incompetent! Cao Lao Ye surely rots in the Heavenly Prison’s deepest cell!”

“I’ve secluded myself lately, ignorant of developments,” Magistrate Qi fibbed.

Cutting through pretense, the Second Prince whispered, “Use your prison access to kill him. Stage it as suicide.”

“But his sudden death…”

“Such stupidity!” the Second Prince hissed. “Make it convincing—a guilt-ridden end. Once done, even His Majesty cannot protest.”

Relenting, Magistrate Qi vowed, “It will be handled immaculately.”

As the conspirators dispersed, Chancellor Li arrived with the miraculous stone. The Second Prince admired its golden veins. “To the palace! His Majesty’s delight shall be our shield.”

In the rear halls, Emperor Hongzhi mused over Cao Lao Ye’s fate. “Let the Qins squirm. Their own missteps will deliver them to justice.”
