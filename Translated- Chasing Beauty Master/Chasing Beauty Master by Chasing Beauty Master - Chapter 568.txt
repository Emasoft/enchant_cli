The old man gazed at Guan Yu’s earnest expression, his heart swelling with emotion. His eyes glistened with unshed tears, but he held them back, knowing that if he faltered in his resolve, this child would lose his pillar of strength.

“Little one, you needn’t rise so early anymore,” he said gently. “This old man isn’t hungry in the mornings. Two meals a day will suffice.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Grandpa, don’t worry about me. I can’t sleep in anyway—it’s a habit after all these years. Besides, even if you’re not hungry, I am!”

With a playful grin, Guan Yu drew a hearty laugh from the old man. “You little rascal, always quick with a retort for this old man! Hahaha… *cough* *cough*!”

The laughter triggered the old man’s asthma, leaving him red-faced and wheezing. Guan Yu hurriedly handed him a cup of water and gently patted his back.

“Grandpa, I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have made you laugh. I’ll… I’ll punish myself!”

He flipped twice on the ground, somersaulting like a acrobat. The old man, now recovered, watched with quiet awe. *This child has innate talent for martial arts. What a waste that an old relic like me can’t nurture it.*

Noticing the old man’s distant gaze, Guan Yu scrambled up. “Grandpa, are you still upset? Should I flip again?”

Instead of answering, the old man asked abruptly, “Guan Yu… do you wish to learn magic?”

The question stunned Guan Yu. In all his years, Grandpa had never once mentioned magic. Why now?

Though Guan Yu had never practiced magic, he lived on a continent that revered it. To him, magic was like a ghost—everyone spoke of it, yet none had truly seen it. For common folk like them, magic was a luxury as distant as the stars.

What Guan Yu didn’t know was that the most renowned mage in Chenyun Village’s history—the Grand Mage who’d vanished decades ago—was none other than the man before him: Chen Renzé (Benevolent Grace). After a catastrophic accident stripped him of his powers, Chen Renzé had altered his appearance and returned to the village in secret. To Guan Yu, however, Grandpa was simply Grandpa—a humble elder raising a parentless child.

“Grandpa, I don’t want to learn magic,” Guan Yu lied, fists clenched. How could a boy his age resist the allure of magic? But their meager existence barely covered food—how could they afford such dreams?

Chen Renzé saw through the deception. “Little one, stop fibbing. I know your heart.”

Guan Yu’s fists relaxed. Meeting the old man’s kind eyes, he confessed, “I do want to learn… but magic costs too much…”

“Cough! Must your clever mind always take the straight path?” Chen Renzé chuckled. Before Guan Yu could question him, the old man extended his arm. A faint blue vein pulsed beneath the withered skin, glowing with otherworldly light.

On the Azure Beauty Continent, mages were ranked across nine tiers and four realms: Apprentice, Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Grand Mage, Archmage, Grand Archmage, Forbidden Curse Mage, and Grand Forbidden Curse. Each realm bore a sigil color—green for Yellow Rank (Apprentice to Intermediate), blue for Mysterious Rank (Senior to Grand Mage), purple for Earth Rank (Archmages), and orange for Heaven Rank (Forbidden Curse practitioners).

Chen Renzé’s blue sigil marked him as a Mysterious Rank Grand Mage—once the pride of Chenyun Village. Yet even this achievement paled against the continent’s true powers.

“Who said magic requires gold?” Chen Renzé’s eyes twinkled. “Have you forgotten your grandpa’s talents?”

As Guan Yu gaped, memories surged through Chen Renzé—of the night Guan Yu’s parents, pursued by masked assassins of unimaginable strength, had thrust their infant son into his arms. “Let him live quietly,” they’d begged. “Never let him seek vengeance.”

For eight years, Chen Renzé had hidden, disguising even his face. Now, guilt gnawed at him. *Have I robbed this child of his destiny?*

“Guan Yu,” he said solemnly, “if you discovered I’d lied to you… would you hate me?”

The boy met his gaze unflinchingly. “Grandpa, you’ve raised me. I’ll find my own answers when I’m grown. Until then, I’ll trust you.”

Chen Renzé’s laugh turned watery. “With those words, this old bones could die content. Now listen well—starting tomorrow, I’ll teach you magic. But never reveal it to others. Swear this!”

Guan Yu’s heart raced like a galloping steed. Magic! Yet he schooled his features, remembering Grandpa’s teachings: *A great man stays calm amidst storm and sunshine.* Only the hurried clatter of his spoon betrayed his excitement.

**Year 1438, Chenyun Village**

The legend of Chenyun’s Grand Mage had faded into folklore, his disappearance a mystery. None suspected the frail old man tending vegetables was that very hero, his power sealed, his past erased.

**Year 1439: The Path of Magic**

“Really, Grandpa? You’re not joking?” Guan Yu’s eyes shone like twin suns.

Chen Renzé ruffled his hair. “If you’ve talent, you’ll learn in months what others take years. But if not…”

“I *will* have talent!” Guan Yu declared, small fists shaking. The mountains echoed his vow.

Chen Renzé’s heart ached. He’d delayed this moment, fearing to draw attention. But the boy’s unquenchable spirit left no choice. *Forgive me,* he silently begged Guan Yu’s parents. *I must kindle this flame.*

**Year 1440: The Sabertooth**

Dawn’s first light found Guan Yu scaling the ancient locust tree—his companion since infancy. Below, Chen Renzé watched, pride and dread warring in his chest. Today’s lesson would change everything.

The tree’s gnarled branches seemed to whisper secrets of the coming storm.
