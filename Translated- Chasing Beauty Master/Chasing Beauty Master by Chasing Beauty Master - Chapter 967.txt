The situation was clear—the person who had covertly targeted members of the Yu Gang at night could be none other than Shen Fangcheng. Among those Guan Yu had helped Lin Qiaoqiao apprehend, Shen Fangcheng represented the most formidable faction. If even he dared not retaliate against the Yu Gang, others would certainly lack the courage.

Yet Shen Fangcheng knew full well he had orchestrated the attacks. However, rumors of Guan Yu’s fierce protectiveness toward his subordinates had reached him. Earlier, Guan Yu had mentioned Yu Gang members having their legs broken, so admitting involvement was out of the question. With Guan Yu’s temperament, Shen’s own legs would surely meet the same fate.

Since Guan Yu lacked concrete evidence, denial remained Shen’s only path. Regret gnawed at him—antagonizing Guan Yu had been a grave mistake. But it was too late for remorse; survival now demanded his full attention.

“Boss Guan, spare me! I swear I had nothing to do with this! Please investigate thoroughly! I beg you!” Shen Fangcheng pleaded, his voice trembling.

Though Shen’s pitiful act was convincing, Guan Yu saw through it. Without evidence, however, outright punishment was impossible. Yet leniency was never an option—guilty or not, Shen would not escape unscathed.

Guan Yu steadied his tone. “Let’s table this matter for now. But today’s grievances are settled. No need for courtesy between us.” Rising, he addressed Jia Bo: “You arrived promptly. Any obstacles? Seems you’ve been itching for action. Let’s show them what real bandits look like—smash everything!”

At Guan Yu’s command, Jia Bo directed over a hundred Yu Gang members to commence destruction. The cacophony of shattering objects and raucous cheers filled the air.

Meanwhile, Shen’s compliant secretary had emptied his safe, its contents now spread across the mahjong table.

Guan Yu surveyed the haul. “Damn, you live lavishly. Gold bars and cash stockpiled for escape—enough to disappear and live comfortably anywhere.”

His attention snagged on a small transparent bag. “What’s this?” He lifted the packet of white powder. Recognition flashed. “Well, well. This seals your fate. Anyone entangled with this poison is doomed.”

The bag’s contents—a substantial quantity of drugs—spelled disaster. This evidence alone could imprison Shen for life.

The remaining stacks were all U.S. dollars—a practical choice for fugitives, given the currency’s global acceptance.

An idea struck Guan Yu. He gestured at Shen with his gun. “Come here.” Obedient as a kitten, Shen scrambled forward on hands and knees.

“Take whatever you want, Boss Guan!” Shen implored. “Consider it never mine! No one will know!”

Moments earlier, Shen had silently cursed Guan Yu, wishing ill upon his descendants for this devastating raid. But the drugs’ discovery eclipsed all else—terror now gripped him.

If Guan Yu handed the narcotics to police, Shen’s fate would be sealed.

“We’ve no mortal enmity, Boss Guan. Spare me, and I’ll remember this mercy forever! We could even become partners—” Shen’s words dissolved into frantic kowtows, forehead smacking the floor.

“Enough.” Guan Yu reclined in the massage chair. “Secretary—activate this thing.”

“Let me!” Shen scrambled to assist.

“Agh!” The secretary shrieked as Guan Yu kicked Shen back. “Did I permit movement? Keep kneeling!”

**Chapter 2,473: Servitude**

Shen staggered up, body screaming from repeated kicks. “Y-yes…”

“Press the button,” Guan Yu snapped at the secretary. Xue Jing rolled her eyes—the controls were armrest-adjacent, yet he insisted on theatrics.

The high-end chair hummed to life, its silent mechanisms hinting at a six-figure price tag.

“How did you plan to spend this fortune?” Guan Yu twirled his Desert Eagle.

“It’s all yours, Boss Guan!” Shen groveled.

“Good. Secretary—fetch paper, pen, and inkpad.”

Dictating terms, Guan Yu outlined Shen’s “voluntary” donation of all assets to charity—aid for impoverished students, families, and medical patients. The secretary’s elegant script captured every detail.

“Sign and fingerprint this.”

Trembling, Shen complied, tears staining the document as he relinquished his wealth.

Jia Bo reentered, eyes gleaming at the treasure. “We’ve smashed everything. Next orders?”

“Distribute this.” Guan Yu tossed bundles of cash. “A thousand per member. Deliver the rest to our injured brothers.”

As they prepared to leave, Guan Yu pocketed a drug sample. “This ensures your compliance. Donate tomorrow, and it disappears. Defy me, and it goes to the police.”

**Chapter 2,474: Desperate Measures**

Post-departure, the secretary dabbed Shen’s bleeding forehead. “We should report this!”

“Idiot!” Shen roared. “He has the drugs! And his police connections would bury us!”

Surveying the ransacked office, Shen muttered, “As long as the mountain stands, firewood remains.” To the secretary: “Pack everything! Now!”

Dialing a contact, Shen wheezed: “Elder Kong? My factory’s destroyed! Guan Yu’s gang did this—they took drugs to blackmail me!”

Kong, a low-profile underworld figure, chuckled. “A student bested you? Pathetic.”

“Help me ambush him! I’ll pay a million!”

“Money tarnishes our bond,” Kong smirked. “But since you insist… Consider it done.”

As Kong mobilized twenty armed thugs, Guan Yu’s convoy rolled through southern districts, unaware of the trap ahead.

Jia Bo tallied shares in the lead vehicle, euphoria permeating the ranks. Tonight brought both mayhem and profit—a perfect outing.

Little did they know, hunting rifles and sawed-offs awaited down the darkened road.
