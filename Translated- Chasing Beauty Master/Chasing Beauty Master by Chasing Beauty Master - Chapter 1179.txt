Lin Qiaoqiao was now furious whenever she saw Li Gui. With her muddle-headed father by her side and the inexplicable behavior of the Li family today, she couldn't understand why they kept provoking Guan Yu. Normally, the Li family could twist any situation to their advantage, but tonight they seemed determined to court disaster.

Guan Yu was no ordinary man – this she knew well. Neither the Lin nor Li families could afford to offend someone of his stature. Despite repeated warnings, the Lis remained obstinate. Had Li Gui not stubbornly targeted Guan Yu earlier, matters wouldn't have escalated this far.

Watching the confrontation unfold, Lin Qiaoqiao decided to wash her hands of it. The Li father-son pair seemed no match for Guan Yu anyway. Let him teach them a lesson.

In childhood, she'd admired Li Gui as an exemplary older brother. But as they grew, his petty, calculating nature emerged – always scheming for advantage until she gradually distanced herself. Yet childhood bonds persisted; whenever she returned home, they'd still gather with other friends for meals and merriment.

Though aware of Li Gui's narrow-mindedness, she never imagined he'd go this far – especially against Guan Yu.

**Chapter 3021: Come Here If You Dare**

"Fine," Lin Qiaoqiao declared coldly. "Since you insist, I'll stay out of this. But let me be clear – whatever happens next has nothing to do with the Lin family. All present are witnesses. If the Lis suffer losses, don't blame us."

Li Gui sneered at Guan Yu. "You overestimate this trash, Qiaoqiao. Crushing him would be easier than wringing a chicken's neck."

"Solve your business however you like," she retorted. "But if you must fight, take it outside. I won't have my family's property damaged." Her suggestion stemmed from recognizing Guan Yu's unyielding resolve.

Lin Zhonggeng, her father, felt torn. While this arrangement prevented immediate destruction, any outcome would put the Lin family in an awkward position. As the crowd moved outside, he followed, hoping to gauge Guan Yu's true capabilities through this confrontation.

By the Lin family gates stood the tournament arena prepared for tomorrow's bridal contest. Guan Yu positioned himself at the clearing's center, turning to taunt: "Well, Li? You wanted to search me. Here I stand. Come if you dare."

Though initially proposing to fight both Lis simultaneously, Guan Yu reconsidered. Without his inner energy, facing two cultivators might prove disastrous. Better to bait Li Gui first, then adapt if the father joined.

The crowd formed a circle as Li Gui approached, sneering: "Today you'll witness the Li family's might, you thieving bastard. I'll find my watch on your corpse!"

Without warning, Li Gui lunged – a blatant foul by martial standards. The onlookers remained silent, their goodwill toward the Li family outweighing concerns of fairness.

Lin Qiaoqiao's fists tightened as Li Gui attacked with his gentleman's fan. Though called a "friendly spar," the murderous glints in both men's eyes betrayed deadlier intentions.

Li Gui moved with third-class upper rank cultivator speed, fan whirling through air. Guan Yu, weaponless but nimble, relied on footwork rather than brute strength. His darting movements and rapid boxing combinations forced Li Gui into retreat.

The crowd gasped as Guan Yu suddenly shifted tactics – hands behind his back, legs blurring in the "Erlang Leg" style. This Yang family technique, inspired by boxing footwork, emphasized waist-powered kicks delivered with piston-like rhythm.

"Having a seizure, trash?" Li Gui jeered before a thunderous kick sent him flying three meters, fan clattering to dust. Guan Yu stood panting, sweat-drenched. Without inner energy, even defeating a third-class cultivator drained him severely.

As Li Gui writhed on the ground, his father stepped forward. "Impressive skills, young man. Let this elder test your mettle properly."

**Chapter 3022: Maximum Force**

"You shameless curs!" Guan Yu spat. "Defeat the son, then the father comes? Even cultivators shouldn't stoop to such车轮 tactics!"

Lin Qiaoqiao protested: "Uncle Li! This is outright bullying after Guan Yu's exhausted!"

The elder Li feigned dignity: "Merely scholarly interest in his unique style. Surely the young hero doesn't mind?"

Guan Yu, buying time to recover, bluffed: "I didn't even use inner energy on your worthless son. You really want public humiliation at your age?"

The gambit worked. Hesitating, Elder Li withdrew: "True, contesting youths beneath my station. We'll settle this another time."

**Chapter 3023: Buying Time**

As the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu hid his relief. Each breath brought strength returning – his sealed energy paradoxically allowing rapid physical recovery. Tomorrow's tournament loomed, but for now, crisis was averted through wit and the Yang family's legacy.
