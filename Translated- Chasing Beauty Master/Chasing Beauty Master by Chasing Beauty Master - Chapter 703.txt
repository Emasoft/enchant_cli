Liu Shuowei listened to Guan Yu’s words. Though unwilling, his heart—which had nearly leapt to his throat—settled upon hearing the matter would not be publicized. He asked, “Then, Guan Yu, whatever you request, as long as it’s within my capabilities, I’ll accomplish it.”

“First, you must ask the principal to transfer you to another class. Our class no longer needs you. This will effectively prevent you from seducing Lü Mei. Hmm... preferably transfer to Class Six.” Guan Yu thought to himself: Xue Jing, that little demoness, is in Class Six. If she learns of your scandals, she’ll surely give you a proper ‘welcome’ with her fists and feet.

“Fine, no problem.”

“Second, from now on, you will serve me. I’ll naturally approach you when I have orders, but I won’t treat you unfairly. Once the leverage I hold no longer threatens you, you may betray me.”

Seeing Liu Shuowei nod, Guan Yu continued, “Third, you are forbidden to deceive female classmates henceforth. If you want to play around, seek those who sell themselves. I assume the principal has given you ample funds. Finding young, pretty ones among them shouldn’t be difficult. There’s no need to trick innocent schoolgirls.”

“Alright, I’ll obey.” Liu Shuowei agreed, helpless. If this scandal were exposed, his life would be ruined—not only losing his career but also facing strife from his ghastly-looking wife. Losing the support of his father-in-law, the deputy director of the education bureau, would spell true doom.

**Chapter 1786: Rejected**

Liu Shuowei proved obedient, following Guan Yu’s instructions meticulously. Guan Yu commandeered Wei Hongwei’s phone, claiming it was for his own good—the videos inside were too damaging. Wei Hongwei, coming from a wealthy family, simply laughed and bought a new one, relinquishing the old phone to Guan Yu. For the latest chapters of this book, please visit 800 (www.800book.net).

Guan Yu tasked Wei Hongwei with keeping a close eye on Liu Shuowei. True to his word, Liu Shuowei refrained from approaching any female classmates.

Days later, Liu Shuowei was reassigned to teach Class Six. Unexpectedly, Guan Yu’s Senior Year Three Class One welcomed a beautiful young teacher, reportedly recruited from a university.

The arrival of this teacher, Pan Xiaoxia, sent the male students into a frenzy. During lessons, they competed in zeal, eager to interact with her. Pan Xiaoxia, radiant and statuesque at around 1.7 meters tall, possessed a curvaceous figure that captivated the entire class.

At noon, Wei Hongwei sidled up to Guan Yu. “Brother Guan, since you swindled my phone, shouldn’t you treat me to a meal? Last time you borrowed it, I booked a fancy restaurant and ordered a feast, but you stood me up. I ended up paying myself. [Dancing E-Book]”

Guan Yu chuckled. Even without seizing his phone, Wei Hongwei had assisted him often. Treating him was only fair. “Sure. Name your craving—lunch is on me today.”

“Awesome! Brother Guan’s the best! Let’s feast!” Wei Hongwei cheered.

Meanwhile, Class Monitor Chen Maosheng approached Lü Mei with a smirk. “Lü Mei, I have some questions about today’s problems. Could you help me? Let’s discuss them over lunch.”

From Wei Hongwei, Guan Yu had learned about Chen Maosheng’s background: his family had generations in real estate, their business vast, surpassing ordinary firms, with international branches. Kaihuang High had been built over a decade ago by Chen’s father. Despite poor academic performance, Chen owed his monitor title to nepotism—former homeroom teacher Liu Shuowei had granted it to curry favor with his influential father.

Chen Maosheng, bespectacled and outwardly refined, was known for his malicious heart. A snob who bullied the weak and cowered before the strong, he had long coveted Lü Mei but dared not approach her while Han Qiao—her previous suitor—was around. Now that Han Qiao had vanished, Chen seized his chance.

Guan Yu, planning to invite Xue Jing and Lü Mei to lunch, frowned at Chen’s brazen move. Disgusted by Chen’s pretext of “discussing problems,” he nearly scoffed aloud.

Lü Mei, whose grades topped the school, often helped classmates with academics. She replied coldly, “We can discuss questions here. I’ll decline lunch—Uncle Wang will deliver my meal soon.”

Chen’s face darkened. Shooting Guan Yu a glare, he stalked off.

“Brother Guan, Chen Maosheng seems to resent you. Did you harass his mother?” Wei Hongwei quipped.

“His mother? I wouldn’t touch her even if she begged,” Guan Yu retorted dismissively.

“You’ve already made enemies by taking that seat,” Wei Hongwei warned. “Many are plotting against you.”

“Let them come. I wouldn’t sit here if I feared trouble. The more challengers, the merrier.” Guan Yu turned to Lü Mei. “Join us for lunch today?”

Lü Mei’s heart fluttered. *Does he... like me?* Torn, she hesitated. Accepting might invite gossip after rejecting Chen, but refusing could hurt Guan Yu. Before she decided, Uncle Wang entered with her lunchbox.

Guan Yu stood respectfully. “Uncle Wang, I’d like to treat Lü Mei to lunch. Please take her meal back. If you’re concerned for her safety, join us—it’ll foster camaraderie.”

Uncle Wang hesitated. Though tasked with safeguarding Lü Mei, he couldn’t deny her wishes. Both looked to Lü Mei, who finally murmured, “I prefer my mother’s cooking. Thank you, but another time.”

**Chapter 1787: The Young Uncle Wang**

Guan Yu hadn’t expected rejection. “Very well.” He headed out, leaving Lü Mei staring at his retreating figure, heart heavy with regret. *Why didn’t he insist?*

Outside, Chen Maosheng blocked Guan Yu’s path. “Newcomer, stay away from Lü Mei. You saw our connection. Know your place, or you’ll regret it.”

“Regret? What connection? That you’re classmates?” Guan Yu laughed derisively. “Dream on.”

As Guan Yu left, Chen seethed. *Just wait. I’ll make you regret crossing me.*

Alone in the classroom, Lü Mei listlessly poked her untouched meal, thoughts consumed by Guan Yu—his words, his actions, every detail etched vividly in her mind. *Why do I remember him so clearly? Do I... like him?*

Uncle Wang, observing her, sighed. A veteran of unrequited love, he recalled his youth: pursuing a female comrade in the army, rejected repeatedly. Only after her death in a shootout did he discover her hidden affection—pages of unanswered letters and diary entries. Now widowed, he cherished those memories.

“Uncle Wang, I’m not hungry. Take it away,” Lü Mei said.

Noticing the untouched food, Uncle Wang urged, “Miss, skipping meals harms your health. Eat a little.”

Lü Mei shook her head. Uncle Wang sighed. “Miss, seize opportunities. Follow your heart—happiness matters most.”

“Thank you, Uncle Wang.”

Left alone, Lü Mei sank into contemplation until Guan Yu’s voice startled her. “What’s so engrossing? Me?”

“H-How did you know?” she blurted, flushing crimson.

Grinning, Guan Yu unveiled a spread of dishes. “I knew you wouldn’t eat. Brought these back. Wei Hongwei’s at a hotel. Dig in!”

Lü Mei smiled, touched by his thoughtfulness. “Slow down. You’ll choke.”

Mouth full, Guan Yu mumbled, “You care? I eat fast—it’s tastier. You nibble like a sparrow.”

Giggling, Lü Mei watched him chug from a bottle—her bottle, lipstick still on the rim. Guan Yu grinned. “This drink’s extra sweet today.” He gulped more, delighting in her scarlet cheeks.

“Are you hot?” he teased.

“N-No... I’m full.”

“Full? I bought all this!” Guan Yu’s eyes twinkled. Realizing his jest, Lü Mei huffed. “So what? I’ll waste it if I want! You bought too much!”

**Chapter 1788: Buying Gifts**

Guan Yu’s antics dissolved her irritation. As they ate, he ‘accidentally’ drank from her bottle again, savoring the indirect kiss. Lü Mei, mortified, prayed he hadn’t noticed.

“Strange—this tastes sweeter than usual,” Guan Yu mused aloud, suppressing a smirk. Lü Mei’s blush deepened, her neck flushing. When he feigned concern, she stammered, “I-I’m fine. Really.”

Chuckling, Guan Yu continued his charade, savoring her flustered reactions. Beneath the playful ruse, both sensed the unspoken tension—a dance of attraction, neither willing yet to name.
