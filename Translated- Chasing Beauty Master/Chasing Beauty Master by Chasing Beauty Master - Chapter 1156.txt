“I’m not trying to scare you, but to warn you. I can offer you a deal. Hand over the leaders of the Cosmic Gang, and we can avoid bloodshed. The rest of you may leave unharmed. What do you say?” Luo Bo stated impassively.



The current situation was far from ideal. Both Luo Bo and Qiong Si pondered the same dilemma: if a fight broke out, both sides would suffer heavy losses. Though Luo Bo had brought over a dozen of Poisonous Widow’s subordinates, fewer than fifty among them were cultivators—half the number of Qiong Si’s forces. Combined with the Cosmic Gang’s three hundred members, Luo Bo’s side would be at a severe disadvantage.



Qiong Si also weighed the potential aftermath. Though their opponents were fewer, the Cosmic Gang’s members risked severe injury or death.



The Feng Family’s bodyguards, though lazy, were all capable fighters—young and robust individuals recruited precisely for their strength.



But as Luo Bo had noted, the Cosmic Gang consisted entirely of university students. While they might excel in numbers, their lack of combat skill made them vulnerable in close-quarters combat. A confrontation would lead to heavy casualties.



After much deliberation, Qiong Si concluded there was no perfect solution. Even if her Freedom Organization members formed the front line, Luo Bo’s presence posed an insurmountable threat. She stood no chance against him alone.



Luo Bo knew capturing a First-Class Supreme Expert like Qiong Si—Guan Yu’s woman—would suffice for their goals.



“Do you truly believe I can’t capture you?” Luo Bo challenged, though he knew subduing a First-Class Supreme Expert alive would be far harder than killing one.



As his words faded, a voice rang out from the Cosmic Gang’s ranks: “I believe you cannot.”



Luo Bo’s brow furrowed in recognition. Second Only to Wolf emerged, smirking. “It’s been a while. You’ve grown bolder.”



Luo Bo grimaced. Second Only to Wolf’s presence shifted the balance entirely. With him and Qiong Si combined, victory was impossible.



Guan Yu had anticipated this. He’d stationed Second Only to Wolf among the crowd, knowing his presence alone would deter Luo Bo.



As planned, after the confrontation dissolved, Qiong Si’s forces returned to their base, while Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo led the Cosmic Gang back to await Guan Yu.



Back at the Feng residence, Poisonous Widow fretted. “The Cosmic Gang’s massive mobilization shows Guan Yu’s fury over the destruction of his venues. We must hope Luo Bo returns with key hostages to mitigate our losses.”



A message interrupted her thoughts—a photo of Xiang Jiamian, battered and bloodied, with a ransom demand: “Bring ten million within two hours, or he dies.”



Billlin, furious, cursed Guan Yu’s audacity. But with Xiang Jiamian’s cover blown, rescue seemed futile.



“We’ll wait for Luo Bo’s return,” Billlin decided. “If he captures Cosmic Gang members, we’ll trade them for Xiang Jiamian.”



Hours later, Luo Bo returned empty-handed. “We retreated. The opponent had nearly four hundred, including Second Only to Wolf. Fighting would’ve been suicide.”



Billlin’s rage erupted. “You failed? Again?”



Luo Bo shrugged. “Survival was our only victory. Against such odds, retreat was our sole option.”



Defeated, Billlin seethed. Another loss to Guan Yu—another blow to their dwindling hopes.
