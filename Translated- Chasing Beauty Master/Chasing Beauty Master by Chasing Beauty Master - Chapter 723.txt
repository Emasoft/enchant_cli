“So that’s how it is,” Guan Yu mused. He had known Yang Conghan wouldn’t reside here. Her living outside simplified matters. He imagined her dwelling in a secluded villa with only her and Jinhua, making his plans far easier…

Upon entering the Yang family’s main residence, several towering bodyguards—each over six feet tall and radiating authority—approached. Becoming a Yang family guard was no trivial feat.

“Young Mistress,” the bodyguards bowed in unison.

Yang Conghan nodded. “They’re my guests. Where is Grand Elder?”

“He returned moments ago and is dining,” one replied.

Following her through the front hall into the rear courtyard’s side chambers, Guan Yu noted the estate’s formidable security: sentries at every turn, surveillance cameras denser than an imperial palace’s defenses. Without Yang Conghan leading them, penetrating this fortress would have been impossible.

“Grandfather, look who I’ve brought!” Yang Conghan called out, spotting her grandfather at dinner.

Yang Kunlun, her grandfather, smiled faintly at his cherished granddaughter. “Xiao Han, have you eaten? Join me. It’s been too long since your last visit. What brings you today?”

Noticing the trio behind her, he inquired, “And these guests are…?”

“Let me introduce them,” Yang Conghan began, gesturing to Guan Yu. “This is Guan Yu, chairman of Huayu Group. The beauty beside him is his girlfriend, and the portly one is his close friend.”

Yang Kunlun’s chopsticks clattered to the floor. Guan Yu’s arrival signified hope—a lifeline for his doomed son.

Guan Yu’s first impression of Yang Kunlun was of a father who’d sacrificed everything. Though advanced in years, the elder’s robust physique hinted at formidable cultivation, likely sustained to preserve his son’s fading life force. Yet Yang Kunlun’s haggard face, deep wrinkles, and stark white temples betrayed the toll of overexertion—a body aged prematurely by desperation.

Suddenly revitalized, Yang Kunlun strode forward. “Chairman Guan! Forgive this inadequate welcome. Had I known of your arrival—”

“You flatter me, Elder Yang,” Guan Yu interjected courteously. “I apologize for the abrupt visit.”

**Chapter 1836: An Inconvenient Position**

After exchanging pleasantries, Yang Kunlun marveled, “To think Huayu’s chairman is so youthful! Had I not seen it myself, I’d never believe it. I imagined a man in his forties. When considering the sacrifice of the World Sovereign’s Relic, I’d feared my granddaughter’s happiness would be compromised. Yet here we find mutual benefit!”

As they moved to the main hall, Xue Jing urged, “Elder Yang, let us assess the Family Head’s condition first.”

“Yes, Grandfather. Father’s situation takes precedence,” Yang Conghan added.

Nodding, Yang Kunlun led them through winding corridors and a rear garden’s grove to an isolated, sealed chamber. The moment its heavy iron door opened, frigid air engulfed them.

Inside the ice cellar lay the Yang Family Head at its center. The sight stunned them all. Xue Jing’s suspicions of deception vanished. Wei Hongwei turned away, unable to bear the gruesome spectacle.

Yang Conghan trembled, tears streaming as she clutched her mouth. Her father resembled a skeletal wraith—bald, emaciated, sustained only by a thread of potent Qi shielding his heart meridian. Guan Yu recognized this as Yang Kunlun’s lifelong cultivation poured into preserving his son.

After checking the pulse, Guan Yu asked, “When did the Qi deviation occur?”

“Nearly a year past,” Yang Kunlun replied.

“Even with the relic, recovery may leave him crippled. We must act swiftly. Xue Jing, the relic.”

As Xue Jing produced the glowing World Sovereign’s Relic, its energy flooded the chamber. The artifact seemed sentient, greedily absorbing the ambient moisture. Guan Yu placed it in the comatose man’s mouth, guiding it down the esophagus with Qi.

Sitting cross-legged, Guan Yu channeled energy to dissolve the relic and mend shattered meridians. Time crawled. Wei Hongwei, lacking cultivation, soon faltered in the cold. Even Yang Kunlun struggled.

“Elder Yang, let us wait outside,” Xue Jing suggested. “This chill endangers you.”

“Agreed! I’m freezing to death!” Wei Hongwei bolted out.

Yang Kunlun glanced at his son. “We’ll trouble Chairman Guan further. Come.”

“I stay with Father,” Yang Conghan insisted, resolve unshakable.

Left alone, her anxiety deepened. Hours passed. Gradually, the cold penetrated her defenses. Shockingly, she found Guan Yu and her father encased in inch-thick ice.

Panicked, Yang Conghan embraced Guan Yu from behind, crying out at the piercing cold. Channeling her cultivation against the chill, she clung until footsteps announced Xue Jing’s return with the others.

Wei Hongwei’s eyebrows danced at the sight of Yang Conghan’s hands resting suggestively on Guan Yu. “Lucky bastard,” he muttered.

Rousing, Guan Yu sensed Yang Conghan’s steady breath and fragrance. He withdrew his energy—the Family Head’s meridians were half-restored, his complexion healthier, having assimilated both the relic and Yang Kunlun’s Qi.

Yang Conghan started, flushing crimson as she realized her compromising position.

“Satisfied?” Guan Yu teased. “Or need more?”

“You rogue!” She swatted his shoulder, mortified.

Rising, Guan Yu sobered. “Thank you, but never risk this again. You could’ve died.”

Yang Kunlun rushed forward. “Chairman Guan, his condition—?”

“Stabilized. He’ll recover fully, even gaining unparalleled cultivation from assimilating your energy and the relic.”

Relief swept the room. Xue Jing smiled—not for the Yangs, but for Guan Yu’s triumph.

**Chapter 1837: Pig-Brained**

Yang Kunlun had his son moved to a sunlit front chamber. “He needs forced feeding thrice daily—liquid diets initially. Expect digestive issues. Bowel care is essential. Awakening depends on his absorption of the relic’s power—days, perhaps months.”

Clasping Guan Yu’s hands, Yang Kunlun vowed, “The Yang family owes you an immeasurable debt. Any future need, we’ll brave flames for you.”

“Address me as Guan Yu. Your family already repaid me.” He glanced at Yang Conghan, who blushed, twisting her skirt. The unspoken pact hung clear—she was his now.

Amidst knowing smiles, Yang Conghan arranged her father’s care, deciding to stay.

Departing, Wei Hongwei gushed, “Brother Guan! You’re invincible! Nothing’s beyond you!”

Guan Yu basked in the flattery.

Next morning, he found Pan Xiaoxia vibrant in class and napped contentedly, drooling until Lü Mei dabbed his mouth.

At lunch, Lü Mei teased, “Heard you claimed A City’s Ice Queen?” Her tone sharpened on “claimed.”

Guan Yu shot Wei Hongwei a glare—the blabbermouth. “She came willingly. Should I refuse?”

“Hmph.”

Entering with two lunchboxes, Butler Wang set them down. Lü Mei pushed the black one forward. “Mother made this for you.”

“Black and white pairing? Charming.” Guan Yu grinned.

“You skipped days without word!” she pouted.

He kissed her cheek. “Compensation enough?”

“Fool! Butler Wang’s watching!” She swatted him, giggling.

Wei Hongwei burst in, clutching a red ear. “Brother Guan! Save me!”

“Boiled alive in ten minutes?”

“Lan Yu’s blockading the gate! Demands you or she’ll camp there! Look what she did!”

Guan Yu groaned. “Idiot! Eat cafeteria food! Must you play big spender?”

“But Jia Bo invited girls! I need a date!”

“Random girls dining with strangers? Let Lü Mei find you a proper match.”

Guan Yu turned to Lü Mei. “Prioritize his ‘needs.’ Find someone… functional.”

Lü Mei hesitated. (To be continued in *800 Book Net*)
