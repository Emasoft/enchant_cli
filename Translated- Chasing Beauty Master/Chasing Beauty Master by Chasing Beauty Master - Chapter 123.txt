“Both here to check into a hotel room, young men in their twenties. Yet the disparity in their situations and treatment created such a striking contrast.”

Guan Yu cast a sympathetic glance at the poor fellow, raising his eyebrows in helpless resignation before gesturing for Liu Shilei to follow him toward the elevators.

No sooner had they entered the elevator than the doors began closing—only to be violently interrupted by a plump middle-aged woman dragging the young man toward them like a hurricane. At the last possible moment, the woman pivoted sideways, thrusting her ample posterior against the closing doors.

*Screech—* The doors shuddered violently, rebounding open with alarming speed. The impact nearly dislodged the mechanism entirely. *Damn, she almost broke the door!* Guan Yu silently cursed, coughing awkwardly as he shifted to make space. Even so, the elevator groaned and swayed perilously when the woman barged in.

As the elevator ascended, Guan Yu prayed fervently that the woman wouldn’t move an inch. If the cables snapped under her momentum… *What a tragic way to die.*

Reaching the fourth floor safely, Guan Yu exhaled in relief. *Survived the elevator, but her perfume might’ve finished me off anyway.* The cloying chemical stench—more industrial solvent than fragrance—had polluted the air like toxic fumes.

Tugging Liu Shilei ahead, Guan Yu hurried down the hallway to avoid trailing the woman. At Room 411, he fumbled for the keycard. Glancing sideways, he spotted the dejected young man lingering outside Room 41, head bowed as if bearing the world’s sorrows.

Sensing Guan Yu’s gaze, the man looked up despairingly, his eyes pleading toward Liu Shilei.

*Oh hell no.* Guan Yu bristled, shooting the man a territorial glare before possessively wrapping an arm around Liu Shilei and steering her into their room.

The stranded youth hesitated at his doorway.

“Darling, come in… sit with me!” The rotund woman—clearly fearing her prey might escape—beckoned with a meaty paw resembling a bear’s paw.

*BANG!* A thunderous door slam echoed from next door. Guan Yu knew the poor soul was doomed. Tonight’s ordeal would be merciless.

Alone in their room, Guan Yu and Liu Shilei relaxed on the bed. He nuzzled into her hair, murmuring sweet nothings until a bestial groan erupted through the wall.

“Ugh…”

“So… big!”

The woman’s raspy, exaggerated coos left Guan Yu stunned. Despite the三星hotel’s supposedly decent soundproofing, rhythmic *slapping* noises and guttural moans soon permeated the room.

Liu Shilei flushed crimson, burying her face against Guan Yu’s chest. “That woman’s… ferocious,” Guan Yu muttered. Clearly, the pair hadn’t bothered with showers before charging into battle.

When dual cries of passion replaced solo performances, the adjacent drama crescendoed:

“Oh! You’re amazing!” the woman panted.

“Fuck—Auntie! My back! Ease up! You’re crushing my pelvis!” the man wailed.

Liu Shilei stifled giggles into her palm. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu tilted her chin up mischievously. “How about we… do some homework too?”

“Don’t you dare!” she protested, though her breath hitched as his hands wandered. Minutes later, her resolve crumbled under his touch and the relentless soundtrack from next door.

“I—I need a shower!” Liu Shilei squirmed, tugging at the hand beneath her waistband.

Guan Yu’s fingers dipped lower. *Ah, dampness.*

She fled to the bathroom. Smirking, Guan Yu lit a cigarette, listening to the neighbor’s agonized yelps until the noise subsided. Two hours later, Liu Shilei emerged—flushed and limp—only for Guan Yu to corner her again.

**Chapter 301: Where Do You Like? Where Exactly?**

Bathroom antics gave way to bedridden exhaustion. Liu Shilei lay sprawled like a steamed shrimp, gasping. “You brute… no mercy at all.”

“You told me to hurry,” Guan Yu teased, kissing her swollen lips.

“You’re responsible for this,” she pouted.

“Gladly.”

Their post-coital tranquility shattered when Du Xiaojuan called. Guan Yu tensed, but Liu Shilei chuckled. “Answer it. *I’m* the one her boyfriend’s with tonight.”

She clung to his back, breasts pressed against him. “Besides…” Her gaze dropped meaningfully. “You’re… spent, aren’t you?”

*Clever girl,* Guan Yu realized—she’d drained him deliberately. The call revealed Zhao Jing’er hadn’t eaten all day, forcing his return home.

**Chapter 302: A Single Misstep Leads to Eternal Regret**

“Leaving?” Liu Shilei asked brightly.

“Yeah…”

To his surprise, she beamed. “Let’s meet again tomorrow? Or the day after?”

*Addicted already?* Guan Yu marveled.

Checking out, they encountered the wrecked young man clutching his back in the lobby—a stark contrast to his radiant companion. The woman glowed, hair glossy from her conquest.

Guan Yu bit back laughter. *Choose your flings wisely, friend.*

After dropping Liu Shilei off, Guan Yu returned home to find Zhao Jing’er listless on the couch.

“Big Brother!” She perked up, playing the dutiful sister.

Du Xiaojuan bounded downstairs, sniffing him suspiciously. “Why so late?”

“Student council paperwork,” he lied.

As she nuzzled his chest, Guan Yu marveled at the ancient wisdom: *Lovers’ quarrels mend in bed.* Truly, the perfect conflict resolution.
