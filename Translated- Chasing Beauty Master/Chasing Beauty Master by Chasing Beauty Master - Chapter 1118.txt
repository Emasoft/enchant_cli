Bill Lin immediately brightened. “That’s right! You’re absolutely correct. Excellent – this is indeed a brilliant plan. Hehe, if I can acquire the treasure map at a low price, you’ll certainly receive your share of benefits when the time comes.”

Slapping Zhang De’s shoulder heartily, Bill Lin continued, “All this goes without saying. Naturally, Young Master Bill should be informed of everything worth knowing.” Zhang De spoke with practiced deference. Bill Lin now regarded Zhang De with newfound appreciation, finding the man increasingly agreeable and even considering recruiting him.

At this moment, Old Wu emerged from the inner chamber, smiling broadly as he addressed them. “My deepest apologies for keeping you waiting. Shall we continue our discussion inside?”

“Excellent suggestion!” Bill Lin took the lead. “Today’s business is of great importance and warrants thorough deliberation. Let us proceed.” Following this, Old Wu ushered Zhang De and Bill Lin into the private chamber, leaving Widow Poison and Luo Bo waiting outside. Though excluded, Bill Lin saw no threat from Old Wu and acquiesced comfortably.

Once seated in the inner chamber, Bill Lin cut to the chase. “Master Wu, my purpose here is clear – to purchase that treasure map you’ve acquired. Will you now show us the merchandise?”

Old Wu offered an apologetic smile. “Given the item’s extraordinary value, I cannot casually reveal it. Perhaps we might first discuss pricing?”

This familiar tactic – identical to how Old Wu treated other clients – only strengthened Bill Lin’s faith in Zhang De’s earlier warnings. “What?” he exclaimed. “You demand price negotiations before verification? How can we discuss numbers without authenticating the item? Master Wu, this shows remarkable lack of sincerity!”

“Ah, Young Master Bill misunderstands!” Old Wu hurried to explain, taken aback by the outburst. “Precisely because this treasure cannot be easily replicated do I exercise such caution. You must understand – I wouldn’t dare offer you counterfeit goods even if I possessed a hundred lifetimes’ courage!”

Finding this explanation somewhat palatable, Bill Lin fell silent, glancing meaningfully at Zhang De.

Zhang De interjected smoothly, “Preliminary price discussions aren’t unreasonable, merely time-consuming. Our Yang Family Patriarch heard you acquired this map for 1.5 million from a farmer. To demonstrate our goodwill, Patriarch Yang authorized me to purchase it for 6.5 million – granting you 5 million pure profit. How does this sound?”

Old Wu’s expression frosted over. “This price... is shockingly low. Completely unacceptable.” Even Bill Lin stared wide-eyed at Zhang De, astonished by the absurdly low offer.

Noting Old Wu’s reaction, Zhang De pressed on, “Master Wu, know when to quit. Half a million profit in two days is substantial. You’re not operating the Yang Family Auction House here – did you truly expect to fetch tens of millions?”

“That’s precisely what I intended!” Old Wu retorted bluntly. “If Yang’s auction can achieve such prices, why shouldn’t I?”

Chapter 2861: Greater Convenience

“You overestimate your position,” Zhang De countered. “The crucial difference is security. The Yangs guarantee absolute protection for auction items – can you offer the same? Should you sell this map today, tomorrow might bring chaos. Have you considered this?”

Bill Lin marveled at Zhang De’s silver tongue, watching him miraculously justify this laughable 6.5 million valuation. Privately, Bill Lin recognized that accepting such a price would confirm the map’s falsity – no genuine treasure would be sold so cheaply.

“Let me improve the offer,” Bill Lin interposed. “Seven million. Does this seem reasonable?” Though still absurdly low, every penny saved mattered to him.

Old Wu struggled to conceal his disappointment. He’d anticipated fierce bidding between A City’s two wealthiest buyers, yet both offered pittances. Just yesterday, someone had offered 15 million, which he’d rejected hoping for better today.

“This price won’t do,” Old Wu shook his head. “You know the market value, Young Master Bill. Have you forgotten what you paid at auction?”

“I remember clearly,” Bill Lin shot back. “But that was a secured auction. Why didn’t you consign it there if you wanted premium prices?”

Old Wu hesitated. He’d considered Yang’s auctions, but their next event was weeks away – too risky given the map’s dangerous nature. Moreover, Yang’s exorbitant commissions made direct sales preferable.

“I obtained this map to profit,” Old Wu stated firmly. “While I don’t expect auction-level prices, 20 million seems reasonable.”

Zhang De burst into derisive laughter. “Hah! You’re truly greedy! Twenty million for unseen goods? This farce isn’t worth my time.” He made to leave, but Bill Lin restrained him.

“Brother Zhang, patience! Let’s allow Master Wu to reconsider.” Bill Lin found himself trusting Zhang De’s judgment despite himself.

Seeing Zhang De’s exit nearly derail negotiations, Old Wu panicked. His grand scheme of pitting two wealthy buyers against each other was collapsing. Could yesterday’s mysterious caller be involved? The one who’d mentioned a 10% cut if desperate?

“Is twenty million truly excessive?” Old Wu pressed. “This is a coveted treasure! Shouldn’t risk warrant reward?”

“Profit is acceptable,” Zhang De retorted, “but not greed. Five million profit in two days suffices. My limit is six-point-five.”

Bill Lin, now fully convinced of Yang Family’s suspicions about the map’s authenticity, made his move. “Master Wu, let’s compromise. Nine million – take it or leave it.”

Zhang De feigned shock. “Young Master Bill’s generosity astounds! To keep bidding despite doubts – such extravagance!”

“Merely a hobbyist’s whim,” Bill Lin preened. “Even if fake, it’s a curiosity for my collection.”

Old Wu’s face darkened. This wasn’t the bidding war he’d envisioned. His dream of easy millions evaporated before him.

Chapter 2862: Presumed Authenticity

Observing Old Wu’s distress, Zhang De administered the final blow. “Consider this – with Young Master Bill as your client, future opportunities abound. His collecting passion could make you rich. Don’t let stubbornness ruin prospects.”

Old Wu finally relented. Retrieving the map from a liquor-scented safe, he revealed the glass-encased parchment. The two buyers scrutinized it – Bill Lin with meticulous care, Zhang De with theatrical skepticism.

“Hmm,” Zhang De frowned. “Having seen three authentic fragments at Yang’s auctions, I notice discrepancies here.”

“Impossible!” Old Wu protested. “I’ve personally verified auction pieces! This matches their aged parchment perfectly!”

Bill Lin seized the opportunity. “My two fragments differ significantly – darker parchment with fainter markings. Yours appears... deliberate.”

Old Wu paled. This wasn’t negotiation – this was sabotage! The cruel irony of treasure hunting struck him: first forgeries became “authentic” through presumption, while subsequent genuine articles were dismissed as fake.

Chapter 2863: Perfect Comprehension

“Let’s cease pretenses,” Bill Lin declared. “Despite doubts, I’ll offer nine million – take it or watch us leave.”

Cornered, Old Wu swallowed his pride. As Zhang De suppressed triumphant smiles, the bitter transaction concluded – a far cry from the fortune he’d envisioned, but preferable to dangerous possession. The game concluded, leaving each player convinced of their own victory.
