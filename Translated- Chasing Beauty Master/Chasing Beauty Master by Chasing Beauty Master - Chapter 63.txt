“Ordinarily, Guan Yu carried himself with a carefree nonchalance, appearing indifferent to everything. Yet since childhood, he’d endured scorn from those around him. Coming from a poor family, both relatives and neighbors looked down upon him and his father. In the eyes of ordinary folk, households mired in hardship naturally invited disdain.

Growing up surrounded by such cold sneers and mocking glances, Guan Yu had long grown accustomed to it. During his father’s interactions with neighbors and relatives, the old man’s voice always carried a hint of timidity, lacking conviction. All these experiences forged Guan Yu’s innermost fragility while simultaneously nurturing his fiercely guarded pride and dignity.

A man may be poor in life, but never in spirit. It was this very fragility—this yearning for warmth, for someone to cherish, care for, and love him—that drove Guan Yu to stubbornly enroll in this university despite his family’s hardships. He’d followed Fu Linlin’s footsteps in pursuit of true affection, only to become entangled with Liu Shilei and now this sweetly naive girl before him through a twist of fate.

Gazing down at Du Xiaojuan’s peacefully sleeping face, an unexpected serenity filled Guan Yu’s heart. A gentle tenderness and affection, like a slowly flowing stream, lingered in his chest. In this moment, he felt profoundly content.

Brushing aside the stray locks clinging to her forehead, he studied her flushed cheeks and delicate features. Pinching her soft cheek, he marveled at its springy resilience.

Du Xiaojuan smacked her lips drowsily, blinking up at him through half-lidded eyes before curling around her plush bear and drifting back to sleep.

“Hey, senior, take off your clothes before sleeping. It’s uncomfortable like this,” Guan Yu whispered, gently shaking her shoulder.

She merely nestled deeper into the pillow, her serene expression undisturbed.

Sighing, Guan Yu glanced at her skin-tight jeans. Should he… help remove them?

Rolling her onto her back, he steeled himself and undid the button. As he slowly pulled down the zipper, his heartbeat quickened.

*Don’t think perverse thoughts. Stay calm.* Chanting this mantra, he carefully slid the jeans off one leg. The white thermal leggings beneath clung to her shapely curves, the swell of her hips and fullness of her thighs testing his resolve.

Averting his gaze, Guan Yu removed her beige jacket. Beads of sweat formed on his brow as he surveyed her in the leggings and blouse.

*No further. The shirt will wrinkle, but…* Removing more would leave only her bra. Though he’d touched—even buried his face in—those soft mounds before, stripping a trusting girl while she slept felt downright beastly.

Holding her lotus-petal delicate feet, he removed her cotton socks. The jade-like coolness of her tiny toes against his palm proved oddly soothing.

After a moment’s hesitation, Guan Yu kicked off his shoes and climbed onto the bed. Lying beside her, he prodded her chest experimentally—the spongy softness sending heat coursing through him.

Clenching his fist, he forced down rising desires and wrapped an arm around her. Within minutes, his traitorous hand crept back to cup her breast, the supple resilience beneath his palm drawing an audible gulp.

*This won’t do!* Scowling, he sat up. The legendary Liu Xiahui’s composure suddenly seemed superhuman. The temptation of her rounded hips mere inches away, the suggestive cleft visible through thin fabric…

Slapping his own cheek, Guan Yu chastised himself. *Desire is natural, but don’t become despicable! She trusts you!*

After draping a quilt over her, he tried spooning her—only for her floral scent and soft warmth to reignite his arousal.

Flipping positions, he lay head-to-foot with her. Though aware of her proximity, this arrangement finally brought peace. Just as he began drifting off, icy toes brushed his arm.

“Cold feet mean no one cares for you?” he mused, cradling her chilly foot. “Yet you’re the pampered heiress. Old sayings are nonsense.”

As he warmed her toes, Du Xiaojuan shifted, draping her other leg across his waist. Dawn found Guan Yu marveling at his own restraint—a modern-day saint.

Morning light roused Du Xiaojuan. Blinking sleepily, she jolted upright upon realizing their position. Meeting Guan Yu’s bloodshot eyes near her feet, she giggled: “So you really are a foot fetishist! Comfy?”

Guan Yu gaped, memories of their hotel misunderstanding resurfacing. “I—I was just—”

“Hush.” She tossed aside the quilt and spread her arms. “For being good… hug?”

Relieved at escaping condemnation, Guan Yu embraced her. After freshening up, he proposed: “Let me buy you shoes today.”

Recalling their first meeting—the ruined shoes, the phone incident—Du Xiaojuan agreed.

With Niu Le in tow, they breakfasted before hitting the mall. Guan Yu outfitted her completely, reveling in his newfound wealth. Though tempted to wallow in cash like Scrooge McDuck, he restrained himself—such antics could wait for millions.

His current goal: Earn enough to free his father from labor. While unsure how to spend riches, he knew financial security required constant effort.

Post-shopping, Guan Yu secreted himself in a bathroom to absorb purchased sugar—his peculiar energy source. Emerging, he deflected Du Xiaojuan’s curiosity: “Hospital visit next.”

At the ward, Luo’s mother greeted them effusively: “Your qigong worked wonders! The swelling’s gone!”

Meanwhile, doctors pored over her miraculous test results. The hospital dean, envisioning career advancement, schemed to present this “miracle healer” to influential figures.

As Guan Yu left with his companions, he resolved to conceal his abilities—even from these trusting friends. The path ahead promised both wonder and peril.
