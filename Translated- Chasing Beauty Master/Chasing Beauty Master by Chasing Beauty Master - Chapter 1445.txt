Finally, Chief Zheng declared, “Xiao Zhi, Guan Yu, and Yan Zhao, your primary objective must be to locate Miao City. Understood? All other matters are trivial. Guan Yu, should any complications arise, pay close attention to your well-being. If the situation becomes untenable, return immediately. The Sect Leader will resolve any issues for you.”

Guan Yu understood the implicit warning in Chief Zheng’s final words: *Do not embarrass the Yunqing Sect with reckless behavior, and never forget the Sect’s nurturing. Do not betray us.* It now struck him that the Sect had sent Xiao Zhi not just as a companion but as a watchdog.

Xiao Zhi pressed further, “We’ve heard the Demon Soul Sect is attacking Tiger’s Maw Manor because the Demon Lord seeks an item from Manor Lord Lu. Moreover, Manor Lord Lu knows how to find Miao City. Father, if we aid Tiger’s Maw Manor in repelling the Demon Soul Sect, might Manor Lord Lu then assist us in locating Miao City?”

“That remains uncertain,” Chief Zheng replied. “I know little of this Manor Lord Lu. Tomorrow, I shall consult the Sect Leader on how to proceed. If Manor Lord Lu truly knows Miao City’s whereabouts… he may well be a demonic practitioner.”

Guan Yu despised their cautious approach. To him, Manor Lord Lu’s malevolence was glaringly obvious. Only a demonic ally would possess such knowledge. *Had he been righteous, the Demon Lord would never have collaborated with him initially. Manor Lord Lu once traded captured cultivators to the Demon Lord for temporary peace. Now that he’s grown arrogant and defiant, the Demon Lord seeks to crush him.*

Moreover, Guan Yu suspected Manor Lord Lu not only knew Miao City’s location but also secrets of the Eight-Drum Technique.

Within the Demon Soul Sect’s stronghold, Wang Xiaorong tossed restlessly. Unable to escape, she approached the Demon Lord directly. “Father, Brother Santou said Guan Yu’s life hangs by a thread. I beg you—let me see him, even from afar. I swear no trouble will follow.”

**Chapter 3761: Acting Like a Madman**

The Demon Lord reclined lazily, eyelids half-lowered. “Guan Yu is a rare dual cultivator of martial and mystical arts. He faces no real peril. Santou likely exaggerated to unsettle you.”

“But he seemed earnest! This wasn’t a jest!”

“These days demand your focus on aiding me, not pining after some Yunqing disciple. A daughter’s heart is never fully her father’s once she grows up—but must you shame me by siding with my enemies before even wedding?”

“How can you say that?” Wang Xiaorong protested. “Guan Yu is different! Your quarrel is with Yunqing Sect, not him alone. Must you count him among your foes?”

The Demon Lord sighed. “Our spy in Tiger’s Maw Manor has gone silent—likely exposed. Manor Lord Lu proves more capable than expected.” He fixed her with a stare. “You’re aware I prepare to strike Tiger’s Maw Manor. Guan Yu and his sect brothers now reside there, plotting to aid Lu against us.”

Wang Xiaorong fell silent, stunned. If Guan Yu stood with Tiger’s Maw Manor, he’d be in grave danger during the assault. “Father, let me join the attack! I’ll assist Sister Right Envoy and ensure victory.”

The Demon Lord arched a brow. “Your words are dutiful, but your heart seeks only Guan Yu. I see through your ploys, little fox.” He paused, then smirked. “Very well. The Right Envoy needs reinforcements. Accompany her.”

Wang Xiaorong bolted upright. “I’ll depart at once! Rest well, Father!” She fled before he could reconsider, not even pausing to pack or change clothes, seizing a horse to gallop into the night.

The Demon Lord shook his head. “That girl… acting like a madman.”

At dawn, Yan Zhao awoke groggily. The knockout drug Xiaohui had slipped into his wine left him ravenous and disoriented. *That treacherous maid! I’ll demand justice from Manor Lord Lu when next we meet.*

Summoned to breakfast, Yan Zhao joined Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi—the latter emerging from Guan Yu’s chamber. “Since when do you rise early, Guan Yu?” Yan Zhao yawned. “You usually laze till noon.”

“Hunger conquers habits,” Xiao Zhi remarked. “Elder Brother, you look dreadful—pale as a ghost. Rough night?”

“Ugh, Manor Lord Lu’s wine felled me. Let’s eat.” Yan Zhao deflected.

In the grand hall, Manor Lord Lu sat alone. Guan Yu probed, “Where are your family members, Manor Lord?”

Yan Zhao glanced around, noting Xiaohui’s absence. *Do the maids rotate shifts?*

Lu chuckled. “A bachelor’s confession: I’ve no wife or children. Tiger’s Maw Manor consumes all my energy.”

“Your stewardship brings prosperity,” Yan Zhao flattered. “A legacy any ancestor would praise.”

“Merely upholding my forebears’ work,” Lu demurred. “Stagnation would mark me a failure.” Noticing Yan Zhao’s searching gaze, he added, “My apologies for Xiaohui’s misconduct. She’s been dismissed.”

Yan Zhao hid his disappointment. *Such a waste!* “The fault was mine—poor tolerance for strong drink.”

Lu studied him. Last night’s ravenous beast now posed as a refined gentleman. *Playing the noble before his juniors?* Aloud, he invited, “Join me at the western ramparts today.”

“We toured them yesterday,” Xiao Zhi said. “Even Qujiang City’s walls pale before yours.”

**Chapter 3762: Sound Reasoning**

“Generations of Lu family labor built them,” Lu replied proudly. “Nothing but the finest—a bulwark against countless threats.”

Guan Yu observed Lu closely. The man’s relaxed demeanor amidst impending siege puzzled him. *Such confidence—or façade?* “Manor Lord, you mentioned knowing Miao City’s location. Surely you’re aware of the Eight-Drum Technique?”

Lu feigned surprise. “That myth? In my view, it doesn’t exist.”

“But we witnessed its first volume in Meng Hua’s tomb!” Xiao Zhi countered.

“Saw it? Or saw a forgery?” Lu challenged. “Meng Hua’s prowess was exaggerated. Had the Eight-Drum Technique been real, the demonic sects wouldn’t have declined.”

Yan Zhao glanced at Guan Yu but held his tongue.

“The Demon Soul Sect seeks it,” Xiao Zhi pressed. “Guan Yu saw their first volume!”

“Deceptions,” Lu scoffed. “If the Demon Lord possessed even one volume, chaos would reign. Its absence proves the technique’s emptiness.”

“Sound reasoning,” Yan Zhao mumbled through a mouthful of food, though doubts nagged him. *If the technique’s weak, why covet Guan Yu’s?*

Lu pressed his advantage. “Rumors claim the second volume lies in Miao City. Had I such knowledge, I’d have seized it already. Why fear the Demon Soul Sect?”

Guan Yu sensed the subterfuge—Lu’s darting eyes betrayed concocted lies. *He knows more than he admits.* Aloud, he quoted: “*Beneath golden spires, on sacred stones, when blossoms scent the wind, divine power emerges.* This verse guides seekers to Miao City on the fifteenth of seventh month. You’ve heard it?”

Lu blinked innocently. “Poetic nonsense. What proof links it to the Eight-Drum Technique?”

Guan Yu barely suppressed a sneer. *Even obscure sects chase this rumor. His ignorance is feigned.*

**Chapter 3763: A Grudge nursed**

Yan Zhao shoveled food while scheming. *If the technique’s weak, why does Guan Yu’s aura feel so potent? I must extract it—but how with Xiao Zhi guarding him?*

Lu continued, “The Demon Lord likely fabricated this ‘Eight-Drum’ legend to misdirect. Wise men shouldn’t—”

Guan Yu interrupted, “Every faction from major sects to bandits now scours the desert for Miao City. You alone remain indifferent?”

Lu spread his hands. “Tiger’s Maw Manor focuses on practical defenses, not fairy tales. Let fools chase shadows.”

*Liar,* Guan Yu thought. The Eight-Drum’s energy had once rivaled the seal in his mind—its power was undeniable. *Lu hides his greed behind reason.*

Yan Zhao swallowed a dumpling, frustration simmering. *That technique is my key to supremacy. Guan Yu’s vigilance tightens daily… When will my chance come?*

Unseen by others, Manor Lord Lu’s fingers twitched—a nervous tic. His performance strained against Guan Yu’s piercing scrutiny. *Let them doubt the legend. Fewer rivals when I claim it.*
