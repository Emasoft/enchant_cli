Over a dozen provocatively dressed girls waved small flags and screamed wildly on the sidelines, exuding a fierce, untamed energy.

Yet to Guan Yu's eyes, this race was pathetically small-scale—utterly incomparable to events hosted by elite families. The road's terrain map especially disappointed him, presenting no real challenge. Apart from three or four thirty-degree bends, the entire course was essentially a straight line.

To put it bluntly, Guan Yu could navigate this route blindfolded.

These arrogant young masters wasted their Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Koenigseggs—professional racing machines—on such a trivial track.

Just then, a fiery young woman approached. Around eighteen or nineteen, she wore a revealing halter top and shorts so short they barely covered essentials, her pale legs drawing countless stares.

She scrutinized Guan Yu, Jiang Ziqi, and Dongfang Mu with disdain before addressing Dongfang Huowu (Fire Dance): “So this is your cavalry, Xiao Wu? A college student? One who looks halfway presentable, and another… practically ancient! Should he even risk a heart attack playing this game?”

Guan Yu and Dongfang Mu exchanged wry smiles, too mature to retaliate. Not so Jiang Ziqi—the quintessential Beijing elite bristled at being called “presentable.” Only their restraint stopped him from slapping her.

“Sun Yaoqi (Radiant Jade), save your gloating until you’ve beaten my master!” Dongfang Huowu thrust Guan Yu forward.

Sun Yaoqi burst into laughter. “Desperate much, Xiao Wu? Hiring this bookworm as your master? He can’t possibly race! You’d have better luck with me!”

Though not a professional, Guan Yu had never been so belittled. He reminded himself: She’s just a kid. Be the bigger person.

Undeterred, she taunted, “Hey, nerd! Scram home and study! Without good grades, how’ll you survive this competitive world?”

The crowd roared. Even Dongfang Mu chuckled. Jiang Ziqi smirked, needling, “Now, Guan Yu—gentlemen don’t squabble with little girls.”

Enough. Guan Yu hauled Sun Yaoqi over his knee and spanked her bottom.

*Smack!*

Stunned, she writhed. The pampered princess had never been spanked—not even by her mother—let alone humiliated publicly. But Guan Yu’s strength overwhelmed her.

Dongfang Huowu cackled, relishing her rival’s comeuppance—until recalling her own first encounter with Guan Yu. Blushing, she stole a glance at him. *Does he have a spanking fetish?*

Guan Yu, thoroughly enjoying himself, ignored her thoughts.

Sun Yaoqi’s tears finally erupted.

Baffled, Guan Yu wondered why these girls cried so easily. “Had enough? Or need more lessons?”

Sniffling but defiant, she challenged, “Bully! Race me properly!”

“Feisty!” Another smack. “Deal. When I win, you’ll serve me—tea, foot massages, the works—for a month.”

“Be your maid? Never!” The heiress recoiled.

“Then I’ll keep spanking.” Guan Yu found her spiritedness amusing, not malicious.

“You’re vile!” She threatened tears, but he remained unmoved.

“Fine!” She spat. “When I win, you’re my slave!”

They chose cars: her silver Koenigsegg versus his Ferrari. Guan Yu noted her bold choice—a beast most men feared to handle.

As engines revved, Dongfang Huowu hissed, “Lose, and you’re banned from our house!”

Guan Yu rolled up his window, ignoring her.

At the flag drop, Sun Yaoqi’s Koenigsegg rocketed ahead. Guan Yu lingered, savoring his Ferrari’s purr before casually accelerating.

“He’s not even trying!” Dongfang Huowu fumed as Sun Yaoqi vanished ahead.

Dongfang Mu reassured, “He’ll win. Watch.”

Halfway through, Guan Yu floored it. The Ferrari screamed forward, overtaking Sun Yaoqi at the first bend.

“How?!” She gaped at his taillights, then furiously pursued.

Guan Yu toyed with her—surges and slows keeping her perpetually behind. Enraged, Sun Yaoqi overaccelerated…

At the next bend, her car careened toward a cliffside guardrail.

Time froze—until Guan Yu materialized, slamming onto her hood. The Koenigsegg screeched to a halt inches from the drop.

Shaking, Sun Yaoqi clung to him, sobbing.

The spectators stared, awestruck. Jiang Ziqi murmured, “Is this his true power?”

Dongfang Mu grinned. However Guan Yu did it, his prowess was undeniable—and crucial for their looming clash with the Song family.

“Enough tears,” Guan Yu said gently. “You’re safe.”

She clung tighter. “I don’t have a boyfriend,” she blurted, burying her face in his chest.

**Chapter 1083 Racing Against Sun Yaoqi (Radiant Jade)**

The crowd erupted as Guan Yu’s Ferrari crossed the finish line first. Sun Yaoqi, trailing behind, grudgingly acknowledged defeat.

**Chapter 1084 Rescue**

Dongfang Huowu watched them return, torn between relief and an unfamiliar pang. Her brother teased, “Jealous?”

“Never!” She flushed, heart racing. *Why does this bother me?*

Jiang Ziqi chuckled. Guan Yu’s romantic entanglements were just beginning.
