Yang Zhensheng tilted his head with a smirk and strode toward the black-clad man sprawled on the ground. Standing over the prone figure, he glanced down before grinning at Niu Le. “Quite the ruthless move… Tone it down next time. If you actually kill someone, no one can save you.” He raised an eyebrow at Guan Yu and nodded.

Guan Yu shrugged with a chuckle, quirking his brow at Niu Le, who scratched his head sheepishly. The latter’s face was smeared with dried blood, giving him the appearance of a bedraggled stray cat.

“Get up! Stop playing dead! Keep lying there and you’ll bleed out for real!” Yang Zhensheng barked, delivering a sharp kick to the black-clad man’s side.

The man groaned weakly, eyelids fluttering open before sliding shut again.

“Refusing to move, eh? Think playing dead will work on me?” Yang Zhensheng snorted, nudging the man’s abdomen with his toe. “Look at all that blood. Once it’s gone, so are you! Enjoy savoring death’s approach. You lot—” He jerked his chin at the other subdued figures. “—On your feet! Hands on heads! Load them into the vans!”

Four men behind Yang Zhensheng moved swiftly, herding the battered captives toward the vehicles.

“Pathetic. Bragging about being ex-mercenaries abroad, yet getting beaten by college kids.” Yang Zhensheng folded his arms contemptuously, prodding the motionless figure with his boot. “Still can’t get up?”

The man shook his head faintly. Once a severely injured person loses their last shred of willpower, regaining the strength to fight becomes nearly impossible.

“Call an ambulance. Alright, Brother Guan—take your people and clear out. I’ll handle the rest.” Yang Zhensheng waved dismissively.

Guan Yu remained silent, jerking his chin at Wang Zhen to signal the retreat. The freshmen swaggered away like triumphant generals, clustering around Wang Zhen and Tian Hao with cocky grins. Bystanders gradually dispersed.

“Those two have rallied quite the following. Mostly thanks to Niu Le’s reckless charge—without him leading the charge, few students would’ve dared lift a finger,” Guan Yu mused, clapping Niu Le’s shoulder. “Go wash up. Nose alright?”

“Feels broken…” Niu Le tilted his head back, dabbing bloodied tissues to his face.

Guan Yu pursed his lips. “Wait at the washroom.” He turned toward Liu Shilei’s group, inhaled deeply, and approached them.

The real headache began—placating Liu Shilei while managing Du Xiaojuan and Wen Qing. It felt like navigating a lover-wife collision, every solution fraught with peril.

Scrubbing his neck, Guan Yu gestured vaguely. “Let’s head back. Whatever comes, I’ll face it.”

Liu Shilei shot him a glare, huffed at Du Xiaojuan and Wen Qing, then stomped away without another word.

Seizing the moment, Wen Qing sidled up to Guan Yu, looping her arm through his. “Hubby, you were amazing back there!” she purred.

Du Xiaojuan stood trembling, lips quivering as she stared woefully at Guan Yu.

**Chapter 323: You… Bad Woman**

Guan Yu rubbed his nose awkwardly under Du Xiaojuan’s wounded gaze, his eyes darting away. Her heart chilled at his evasiveness—this wasn’t mere misunderstanding. His guilt confirmed there was truth to Wen Qing’s claims.

Tears pooled in Du Xiaojuan’s eyes as she stepped forward, tugging his sleeve. “This… This isn’t real, right? You don’t know her…”

Guan Yu grimaced, shooting Wen Qing a pleading look. Instead of helping, she mimicked Du Xiaojuan’s pout and clung to his other arm. “Who says we’re strangers? He’s my man. I’m his woman.”

“Liar!” Du Xiaojuan whirled to Guan Yu. “You didn’t know her before, right?”

“Didn’t he declare it himself earlier?” Wen Qing countered sweetly. “He said no one touches his woman. Right, hubby?”

Guan Yu groaned inwardly. Niu Le, sensing disaster, tugged Zhao Jing’er’s arm. “Let’s bounce.”

“But I wanna wait for Brother!” the oblivious girl protested.

“Now!” Niu Le hissed, dragging her away despite her protests.

“Stupid Ox!” Jing’er pouted, glancing back curiously at the tense trio.

Du Xiaojuan’s tears spilled over. “Let’s go home… Please? I don’t want to stay here!” Her voice cracked. “Ignore this crazy woman!”

Guan Yu’s chest tightened at her despair. Alcohol’s curse—if only he’d avoided that bar, that night with Wen Qing… Yet he’d taken her virginity. A man owned his actions.

Wen Qing pressed closer. “Do you live together? Can I move in too? Dorms are so lonely…”

Guan Yu stared heavenward. Du Xiaojuan’s tears fell like crystalline drops. “Let’s go home… Please?”

Heart clenching, Guan Yu brushed her tears away. “Class ends soon. Wait in my classroom?”

“I’ll come too!” Wen Qing chirped. “I’ll pack tonight!”

Trapped, Guan Yu fled. “Bathroom break!”

**Chapter 324: Three in a Bed**

Wen Qing cornered him outside the men’s room. “You promised to take me!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Three people sharing a bed? Your reputation—”

“I’m yours already,” she breathed, lips grazing his ear. “That night… I’ve never felt such bliss.” Her breasts pressed against him. “Let me stay. I’ll behave. Even if she bullies me…”

Guan Yu nearly choked. Du Xiaojuan bully Wen Qing? More likely the reverse.

Her floral scent enveloped him. “I’ve never pursued anyone before. You’re my first.” She nipped his earlobe. “Three could be… fun.”

Guan Yu’s resolve crumbled. “Not tonight. There’s… others at home.”

“Others?” Wen Qing’s eyes sparkled. “How many women do you have?”
