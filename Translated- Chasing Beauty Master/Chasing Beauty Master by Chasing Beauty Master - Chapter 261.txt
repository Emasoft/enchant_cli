“Tsk tsk, how touching,” Zhou Jin sneered. “I originally sent Chu Hong to seduce you, never expecting she’d actually fall and become your woman. Honestly, I don’t see what charm you possess.”

Another gunshot rang out, striking Guan Yu’s arm.

This shot was pure venting of an imperceptible rage. Regarding Chu Hong, Zhou Jin harbored possessive desires. The fact that something he hadn’t obtained had been claimed by another infuriated him. Yet this anger didn’t translate to affection—otherwise, he wouldn’t have shot her without blinking.

For enemies, Zhou Jin adhered to one principle: impartial cruelty.

Turning, he fired at Chu Hong’s arm and sneered, “Did you think you could hide your actions? From your first contact with Guan Yu, your demeanor shifted. Though well-concealed, I noticed. I gave you a chance at redemption by sending you to L City. Instead of eliminating him, you collaborated to destroy an entire shipment of arms. Your fatal error was extracting the arms intel from Cheng Gui. You’d have vanished upon return had you not been useful.”

A brutal punch to Chu Hong’s abdomen followed. She endured silently.

“Bastard!” Guan Yu cursed, his gaze flickering to an inconspicuous spot. Almost there.

“Curse all you want,” Zhou Jin taunted. “Whether you finish today or not matters little. I won’t kill you yet—you’ll witness how N City’s underworld falls into my hands. You’ll see the tale of four fields and forty oxes unfold.”

“Scum!” Guan Yu’s eyes burned crimson.

Bang. Another bullet struck his other arm.

“Lunatic!” Guan Yu spat.

Bang. A shot to the calf.

Agony nearly shattered his consciousness. So this was the price for cursing—a bullet per insult. How humiliating.

“Why stop?” Zhou Jin chuckled. Guan Yu stayed silent, willing his allies closer to strike.

Then came devastating news.

“Zhou Jin,” Wan Qianshan reported, “the sudden deaths were from venom—poisonous spiders.”

“Spiders?” Zhou Jin’s gaze sharpened on Guan Yu. “However you managed this trick, your gambit fails. No more surprises.”

“Brother Shan, have the men guard against those arachnids. Leave these lovebirds to me.” Zhou Jin’s smile turned glacial. Wan Qianshan nodded. With Huang Ming dead, Zhou Jin naturally assumed his position. Let the upstart play hero—there’d be time later to leash him.

“Surely you’re not fool enough to take five bullets just for a woman. Were you banking on those spiders finishing us?” Zhou Jin pressed. “Silence confirms it. Your unpredictability’s too dangerous. Meant to let you watch your women die one by one, but she’ll get merciful quick release.”

The gun barrel aligned with Chu Hong’s forehead.

Chapter 662: Unexpected Reinforcements

Had Chu Hong lost her gamble? Perhaps. Yet she felt no regret—today outshone all her previous hollow triumphs. For once, Guan Yu had shown her she wasn’t merely a tool, but a woman of flesh and feeling. Worth dying for.

“I’ll make you watch,” Zhou Jin ranted, madness rising. “Every woman tied to you will share her fate. But I’ll keep my word—you’ll see our grand finale!”

Guan Yu remained impassive. “You think I’d storm this den alone? Neither you nor Wan Qianshan leaves alive tonight. Spare her, and I’ll let you scurry back to Taiwan.”

Zhou Jin froze, scrutinizing Guan Yu’s unreadable calm. “Release us?”

Guan Yu nodded solemnly.

“Why trust you?” Zhou Jin laughed hysterically. “Your villa’s rubble, Feng Xin near death. Your forces crippled, allies poisoned or dead—all my doing. You’d spare me?”

Another nod. “I’d kill you gladly. But her life’s worth trading.”

“Honest to a fault,” Zhou Jin snorted.

“Lie, and negotiations end. Release us, you depart N City.”

“Take me for a fool?” Zhou Jin jeered. “Where are your ambushers? You’re beaten, bargaining from weakness.”

Sighing, Guan Yu suddenly roared: “Now!”

A suppressed gunshot pierced the night. Wan Qianshan’s nearest henchman collapsed, bullet between eyes.

Chaos erupted. Amidst the crossfire, Guan Yu blurred into motion—snapping Zhou Jin’s wrist, seizing the gun, using the screaming man as human shield.

Before eyelids could fully blink, Zhou Jin lay broken at Guan Yu’s feet. Enhanced abilities post-upgrade showed terrifying potency.

“Holy Hollywood blockbuster,” Guan Yu cursed, gaping at the unfolding carnage. Mysterious sniper fire dropped enemies with machine-like precision—every shot a kill.

Chu Hong murmured, “Should’ve filmed this.”

Through his scanning ability, Guan Yu pinpointed the shooter—and nearly choked. The idiot was smoking casually mid-battle, smoke trail betraying position yet remaining unscathed. Before Guan Yu could facepalm, the man vanished like mist, abandoning eight survivors.

“Fall back!” Guan Yu barked, dragging Chu Hong while using Zhou Jin’s corpse as ballistic mulch. Wan Qianshan’s men unleashed hellfire, reducing the strategist to Swiss cheese.

Chapter 663: Crisis Averted

In death, Zhou Jin’s final hatred burned not for Guan Yu, but Wan Qianshan—discarded after years of loyal service.

Wan Qianshan now fought for survival. If Guan Yu held escape’s key, Zhou Jin’s corpse meant nothing. The grand ambition lay shattered.

“Bastards!” Guan Yu cursed, absorbing voltage from shockrods to replenish bullet-drained energy. Supercharged, he kicked Zhou Jin’s riddled corpse into the fray and returned fire—clumsily. Two hits from five shots. Outgunned, outmanned.

Then salvation—the sniper’s cadence resumed. Guan Yu simultaneously wanted to kiss and strangle the shooter.

When silence fell, a familiar drawl sounded: “Coast clear.”

Guan Yu stormed over. “Lin Dong! Nearly got me killed, you prick!”

The smoking marksman shrugged. “Ran out of ammo. Figured you’d croak, but here you stand—five bullets and still hopping. Fascinating resilience.”

Guan Yu’s eye twitched. Scanning Lin Dong’s thoughts revealed the truth: the bastard had watched his struggle for entertainment. Later retribution would come, but for now...

Beneath Lin Dong’s boot squirmed Wan Qianshan. The mastermind’s empire had crumbled to a whimpering rat.
