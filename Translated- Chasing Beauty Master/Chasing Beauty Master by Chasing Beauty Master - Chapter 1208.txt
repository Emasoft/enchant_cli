“What Uncle-in-law says makes sense,” Guan Yu thought. The visions of delicious food he had conjured in his mind shattered instantly at these words.

“Ah, let’s not talk about it anymore. The more we speak, the hungrier I get. I’ll just have some steamed buns first.” Lin Qiaoqiao picked up a large white bun, tore off a piece, and began nibbling.

Before long, Ma Xiao returned. This time, several men followed behind him carrying aromatic dishes. The rich scent of meat wafted into the room before they even entered. Guan Yu’s appetite surged, and he sprang to his feet. Platters of meat dishes adorned the table, including a roasted pig’s leg. Guan Yu laughed heartily, “Ah, thank you so much, Senior Brother Ma Xiao! Let’s not stand on ceremony—dig in!”

Ma Xiao replied, “Please enjoy your meal. Someone is stationed outside—call if you need anything.” With that, he withdrew.

The table now overflowed with delicacies: a roasted chicken, a glistening pig’s leg still steaming with fragrant oils, and two plates of savory beef. Guan Yu and his companions ate with gusto.

Tearing off a large chicken leg, Guan Yu handed it to Xiao Zhu. “Eat up, Xiao Zhu. You must be starving.”

It was already noon, and everyone felt the pangs of hunger. Xiao Zhu gleefully took the drumstick and took a hearty bite. “Wow, this is delicious!”

Guan Yu then offered the other chicken leg to Lin Qiaoqiao. “This one’s for you. Both drumsticks should go to you girls.”

Lin Qiaoqiao accepted it without hesitation. “I told you!” she said between mouthfuls of beef. “When I saw that pasture earlier, all those poultry must be raised for feasts. There are so many—I wonder how many people live up here. They must never run out of food!”

Guan Yu, his lips glistening with grease, remarked, “This mountaintop doesn’t seem large. The main hall ahead occupies nearly a third of the space. The rest appears to be guest rooms and study chambers. There probably aren’t many residents.”

“Hard to say,” Second-to-Wolf chimed in. “We’ve only seen about a dozen people here, including those who brought the food.”

Auntie, eating nervously, voiced her worries. “Guan Yu, why have they brought us here? Could they imprison us forever?”

“Hah, impossible,” Guan Yu reassured. “They’re not fools to keep us here indefinitely. They likely detained us to prevent us from harming that sacred tree. Once they’re assured of its safety, they’ll let us go.”

Uncle-in-law interjected, “These are immortals—ageless beings! That white-bearded sage spoke of events from millennia ago as if he’d witnessed them. We mustn’t offend these celestial beings, lest we incur divine wrath.”

Guan Yu sighed inwardly at his uncle’s superstitious mindset but chose not to argue.

“Mom, I’m thirsty,” Xiao Zhu piped up. Auntie glanced around but found no water.

Lin Qiaoqiao stood. “Senior Brother Ma Xiao said to call for help. I’ll fetch water.”

“No need,” Second-to-Wolf said, ladling soup into a bowl. “This broth might look bland, but it’s better than plain water.”

Xiao Zhu sipped cautiously, then brightened. “Wow! It’s delicious—like seafood!”

“Impossible!” Second-to-Wolf peered into the pot. “It’s just white soup with tofu. Where’s the seafood?”

Guan Yu stirred the pot with chopsticks and discovered shark fin. “Ah, it’s crucian carp soup! Simmered long enough to turn the broth milky. Look—there’s fish meat beneath!”

The group, now stuffed with meat, indulged in the savory soup until they leaned back, satiated.

As they settled for a post-meal rest, a knock interrupted. Ma Xiao entered, addressing Guan Yu, “If you’ve finished, Master requests your presence in the main hall.”

Guan Yu wondered if this summons followed a “last meal” tradition but agreed. Second-to-Wolf insisted on accompanying him for safety.

In the grand hall, the master greeted them warmly. “How was our Qianhui Peak’s hospitality?”

“Excellent,” Guan Yu acknowledged. “Your chefs are skilled. Now, may we discuss your purpose?”

The master gestured to seats. “As guests of Qianhui Peak, you deserve proper reception. I summoned you to inquire about the demonic aura within you. Will you speak truthfully?”

**Chapter 3102: So Be It**

Grandfather Lu sighed. “We detected the energy too late. By the time we pursued, he’d vanished.”

“What connects this to the Tree of Life? Wasn’t it formed from the demon’s tail?” Guan Yu questioned.

“Not quite,” Grandfather Lu explained. “The sapling emerged from the river with immense power, nearly draining it dry. Our elders identified it as the Demon Clan’s Life Tree. The seed must have been hidden in the demon prince’s tail. When the village chief severed it, the seed germinated in the river, growing into its current form.”

“If it’s demonic, why not destroy it?”

“The matter isn’t simple,” Grandfather Lu replied. “Our elders altered the terrain and erected barriers to conceal it from demons. Destroying it would unleash catastrophic energy, breaching the barriers and alerting the Demon Clan. Their invasion would bring apocalypse.”

Guan Yu paled at the revelation. “But letting it drain the land’s vitality endangers villagers!”

“The tree only caused harm once when a child poisoned himself with a leaf. The plague resulted from residual demonic miasma, which we contained. The village chief’s mutated son stems from inherited corruption—human error, not the tree’s doing.”

Guan Yu conceded reluctantly. “Perhaps I overreacted. Preserving the barrier outweighs the risks.”

“Precisely. We’ve sought solutions for millennia without success.”

**Chapter 3103: The Example**

As Guan Yu prepared to leave, a disciple rushed in. “Master! The Demon Sect mobilizes in Yu City. Their purpose remains unknown.”

Grandfather Lu frowned. “After their defeat a century ago, their resurgence bodes ill. We’ll address this after the Six Peaks Assembly.”

Turning to Guan Yu, he explained, “The Demon Sect comprises vile humans and shape-shifting fiends, not true demons. As the leading orthodox sect, we must eradicate them.”

Guan Yu grasped the parallels to martial sects. “What’s the Six Peaks Assembly?”

“A centennial competition among our six peaks,” Grandfather Lu elaborated proudly. “Disciples compete, with finalists training under our patriarch on Tiger Head Peak to learn supreme techniques.”

“Impressive scale. How do you traverse these peaks?”

“Through sword flight—a fundamental skill for cultivators. Unlike your internal energy, we use spiritual power, making aerial travel effortless.”

Second-to-Wolf marveled, “So one must fly to cultivate? Fascinating!”

The exchange illuminated the vast differences between martial and spiritual cultivation, painting a vivid picture of the sect’s grandeur and the precarious balance between mortal and supernatural realms.
