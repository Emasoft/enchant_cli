Ah Mei took a deep breath to steady herself. Xue Jing said reassuringly, "Don't worry, Guanyu will be fine. When has your older sister ever lied to you?"

Ah Mei nodded, yet still voiced her concern, "Sister Jing, do you think Guanyu might really get hurt when he goes out in the future? We shouldn't let him leave so casually anymore."

"Let's worry about the future later. Hurry and check on Guanyu now," Xue Jing said, wiping Ah Mei's tears as the younger girl struggled to stop crying.

Lying on the bed after Yang Conghan and Lü Mei changed his clothes and wiped him down with warm towels, Guanyu noticed Ah Mei's absence. "Is Ah Mei not home? Why don't I see her?"

Lü Mei gently tucked his blanket. "Ah Mei hid in the bathroom crying when she saw you covered in blood. She's always been timid. The sudden sight of all that blood terrified her."

Realizing he'd frightened the poor girl, Guanyu immediately asked Zhang Han to fetch her.

"Guanyu, are you okay? Sniff..." Ah Mei entered, seeing him clean and blood-free, but her tear-swollen eyes and hiccupping breaths betrayed her lingering distress.

"Come here. Let me see if you're alright," Guanyu chuckled. Obediently approaching, Ah Mei whispered, "I was so scared! I thought... all that blood... my soul nearly left me!"

"Don't be afraid. That wasn't my blood—it belonged to others. See? No wounds at all." To reassure her, Guanyu tried lifting the blanket but winced as the movement jostled his injured organs.

Coughing violently, he was immediately surrounded by concerned women: "Are you alright?" "Why did you move recklessly?" "You must be careful!"

Awakened from sleep yet fully alert now, they fussed over him. Ah Mei's tears flowed anew as she bit her lip to stifle sobs. Heart aching at her distress, Guanyu rasped, "Open the blanket. Let her see."

"No need! I believe you!" Ah Mei clutched the covers. "Your safety is all that matters."

"Silly girl, I'll be fine," Guanyu affirmed. Fragile and timid even in games—she couldn't bear to attack cute monsters—Ah Mei nodded vigorously like a bobblehead. "You must be hungry! I'll make your favorite shrimp soup!" Her tear-soaked nightgown clung to her chest, eyes panda-like from crying.

The mention of food stirred Guanyu's hunger. Having barely eaten at Meimei's place at noon, it was now past 2 AM. "Yes, I am rather peckish. Please prepare it."

While Xue Jing and Ah Mei cooked, surprisingly, even mischievous Zhang Han helped instead of pestering Guanyu—sensible enough not to disturb his recovery. Ah Mei carefully fed him spoonfuls before everyone retired.

Guanyu slept until next afternoon, rejuvenated. As he tried rising, Xue Jing stopped him: "Don't move. Stay resting—you're still weak."

Embarrassed, Guanyu confessed, "But I need to urinate."

"Urinate? Simple enough." Xue Jing nodded to Zhang Han, who bounded onto the bed.

"Careful!" Ah Mei cried, but Zhang Han giggled as she yanked off Guanyu's blanket and pants, playfully flicking his member. Lü Mei produced a bedpan while others rolled him sideways.

"Relieve yourself freely," Xue Jing smirked. Crimson-faced, Guanyu complied—comforted that his women's teasing would stay behind his back.

"Ah, much better," he sighed. The girls giggled as Zhang Han pinched her nose theatrically: "I wonder how Big Brother's pee smells!"

After the commotion, exhaustion reclaimed Guanyu. While he recuperated, outside, Qiongsi and Second-Only-To-Wolf hunted his escaped martial sister—a master escape artist evading even First-Class Supreme experts.

Tracking her to Gancheng's mountainous terrain, Second-Only-To-Wolf found her dilapidated hideout between two hills—ideal for her分身(doppelgangers) to scatter. Waiting until night, he demolished the shack with a sword strike, only to find decoys.

Tracking westward, he ambushed her on sparse-wooded Xishan. "Where to?" His blade glowed crimson as she summoned clones.

"Wait!" she stalled. "How did you find me?"

"Your smug sigh reached my ears," he sneered. "Cleverness loses to greater cleverness."

Chapter 2251: Smarter Than You

As she desperately summoned doppelgangers, Second-Only-To-Wolf explained, "The eastern commotion was diversionary qi blasts. I never left—heard your gloating."

Realizing her fatal mistake, the martial sister cursed her hubris. With a bloodied blade raised, the hunter concluded: "Tonight ends this."
