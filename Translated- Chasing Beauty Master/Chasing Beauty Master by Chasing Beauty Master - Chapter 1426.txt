“You shouldn’t speak without knowing the facts. When I entered, I hadn’t planned to give him any money. But when I was about to leave, I thought—after they went through all that trouble to entertain me for so long, answering my questions and helping me inquire about someone—if I just turned and left without buying anything, they’d surely curse me behind my back. Wouldn’t that upset me if I heard? Anyway, it wasn’t much. Giving a little made them admire and thank me instead.”

“How utterly trivial. From the looks of it, the person you’re seeking isn’t known to ordinary folks. Let’s just head to the back and check. Didn’t that waitress say their boss has a residence here? We might find him.” Wang Xiaorong suggested.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Forget it. Let’s go eat first.”

“I’ve been waiting for you to say that! My stomach’s been protesting for ages, but I didn’t want to dampen your search.” Wang Xiaorong pouted.

“Silly girl.” Guan Yu chuckled, tousling her hair. “I’d hoped to find Boss Wang and invite him to dine with us—a chance to chat. You should’ve spoken up sooner. Nothing matters more than filling an empty stomach.”

“Hehe, I remember passing a stone pot tavern on the way here. It was crowded—must be good. Shall we try it?”

Guan Yu nodded. Wang Xiaorong immediately grabbed his arm and hurried forward.

Upon arriving, the tavern was indeed packed. Though modest in size, its reputation drew patrons like moths to flame. The aroma of wine defied the narrow alley’s obscurity.

“Wonder if there’s any space left…” Wang Xiaorong muttered upon entering.

Unlike other establishments where hosts or servers greeted guests, no one acknowledged their presence.

“The staff must be swamped. Look at that lad—drenched in sweat.” Guan Yu pointed to a young man wiping his brow with a towel.

“Let’s find our own seat. That corner table’s free.” Wang Xiaorong gestured toward a window-side spot.

The ground floor alone held thirty tables, nearly all occupied. The remaining seats were poorly positioned, but Wang Xiaorong chose a large table by the window.

As they walked, Guan Yu observed the diners. Most had stone pots before them—each twice the size of a regular bowl—filled with mixed rice and dishes. Others feasted on spreads of food and drank from stone-carved vessels, distinct from typical wine jars.

Their chosen table, though recently vacated, bore leftover grains. Wang Xiaorong grimaced. “Guan Yu, call a server to clean this.”

Nodding, Guan Yu scanned the room. Spotting a clerk at the counter furiously abacus-ing, he flicked a copper coin with precision, striking the man’s arm.

“Incredible aim!” Wang Xiaorong gasped.

The clerk, initially irate, pocketed the coin and scurried over. After wiping the table thrice, he invited them to sit.

As Wang Xiaorong moved to take her seat, a scrawny boy of fifteen plopped down and barked, “Four seafood stone pots!”

“Damn—a seat thief,” Guan Yu muttered.

Wang Xiaorong, restraining herself, said gently, “Child, this table’s taken. Please find another.”

The boy—skeletal with upturned eyes, a bulbous nose, and a thick-lipped mouth adorned with a mole—snapped, “Who says it’s yours? I sat here first!”

His vulgar retort betrayed a maturity beyond his years. Before Guan Yu could react, the boy grabbed a curved knife and slashed at him. Guan Yu pinned the boy’s wrist to the table, effortlessly overpowering him.

“Let go, bastard! My brothers’ll kill you!” the boy spat, attempting to kick. Guan Yu blocked, smashing the boy’s foot against a table leg.

Enraged, the boy hawked a glob of phlegm. Guan Yu dodged, and the projectile struck a woman at the next table.

“Who the hell spat?!” her towering husband roared, seizing the boy by the collar. “Eat this filth, brat!”

As the giant forced the boy’s face toward the tainted food, three hulking men stormed in. “Who dares harm our brother?!”

**Chapter 3710: Spitting in Public**

Guan Yu sat calmly. “A brat like you deserves no mercy. Even thirty brothers couldn’t move me.”

The boy, now purple-faced, screeched, “You’re dead! My brothers’ll slaughter you all!”

The tavern fell silent as the giant pressed the boy’s face into the pot. Suddenly, three bizarrely mismatched men barged in—one tall and gaunt, another short and rotund, the third dark-skinned with wild hair.

“Looks like the Beggar Sect’s elders,” Guan Yu whispered to Wang Xiaorong, stifling laughter.

**Chapter 3711: Dark-Skinned**

The trio’s leader—jet-black with frizzed hair—bellowed, “Release our brother, or die!”

Chaos erupted as patrons scrambled. Guan Yu stood, readying for battle. The dark giant cracked his knuckles. “You’ll regret tangling with the Blackhill Triad!”

Wang Xiaorong drew her dagger. “Three against two? Hardly fair.”

“Four, counting the brat,” Guan Yu corrected, eyeing the boy now cowering behind his brothers.

The standoff tensed—until the tavern door burst open again. A voice colder than winter cut through: “Enough.”

All turned. A pale man in silk stood framed in daylight, a jade pendant glinting at his chest. The Triad blanched. “Boss Wang!”

The newcomer smiled. “Guan Yu, was it? I hear you’ve been looking for me.”
