“I did it! What do you want? Come… all of you, get in here! Now…” With that, Guan Yu stepped aside, clearing the dormitory door and pointing provocatively at the spacious area inside.

The imposing Hao-ge had been radiating murderous intent moments earlier. But upon turning and seeing Guan Yu, he choked on his breath, eyes bulging as he stared in terror.

*Holy hell, it’s that demon!* His mind raced. *Damn… he’s in my dorm zone? This is bad!*

His boss, the dorm supervisor Feng Lei, was still hospitalized after nearly having his skull smashed by Guan Yu’s stool. And those brothers from off-campus? They’d been battered bloody by Guan Yu’s metal signpost until their bones cracked. Even now, Hao-ge’s legs shook remembering it. If he hadn’t hung back that night, he’d be in the ER too.

*It’s him…* Hao-ge gulped audibly, his face twitching before transforming into an obsequious grin. “Oh! It’s you, Big Brother! You’re… staying here?”

Guan Yu had already clenched his fists, ready to unleash the Triple Combo of the Bone-Breaking Fist on this scrawny weasel. But the sudden sycophantic shift left him bewildered.

“You are…?”

“You might not know me, Big Brother, but I know you! Let me introduce myself—I’m Wu Hao, the dorm supervisor! Could we… step inside to talk?” Hao-ge laughed nervously, desperate to avoid provoking Guan Yu’s wrath.

“Hao-ge, who the hell is this? Let’s fuck him up… daring to touch my brother, I’ll—”

“Shut your trap! Are you brain-dead?” Hao-ge whirled, glaring at the instigator. *Idiot! Can’t you see I’m kissing his ass here? You itching for a beating?*

The thug named Big Donkey shrank back under Wu Hao’s roar, eyeing Guan Yu warily.

“Come in…” Guan Yu tilted his head casually and strode back into the dorm.

“Y-yes, right away…” Wu Hao’s tension eased. *Thank god this madman responds to flattery. Maybe we’ll survive this.*

Following Guan Yu inside, Wu Hao hurriedly offered a cigarette. “These fools offended you, Brother. Don’t mind them—they didn’t know who you were! They’d never dare otherwise!”

Guan Yu took the cigarette, lips pressed tight. *Does he know me from the Fire Gang? Or through Boss Liu Jun?* It never occurred to him that Wu Hao had witnessed his brutal takedown of over a dozen men and been permanently traumatized.

“That one upset you, right?” Wu Hao jabbed a finger at the groaning sophomore outside. “I’ll make him apologize!” He stormed over and dragged the pale-faced student inside. “Bow and call him Yu-ge!”

“But I’m a sophomore…” the thug muttered.

“You wanna die? Apologize!” Wu Hao hissed through clenched teeth.

“S-sorry, Yu-ge…”

Guan Yu exhaled smoke, eyeing the cowed student. “Act less cocky next time. Clearly, you haven’t been hit enough.”

“Exactly! He’s asking for it!” Wu Hao fawned, patting Guan Yu’s shoulder. *If I buddy up to this beast, no one will dare cross me again!*

When Guan Yu later announced his decision to drop out, his roommates gaped in shock.

“What? But school just started! Why?”

“No reason. I’m done.” Guan Yu calmly packed, ignoring their protests. Blood still dripped from his knuckles—remnants of his rage-fueled punch that had bent a sapling.

As commotion erupted again in the hallway—upperclassmen bullying freshmen—Guan Yu stormed out. “Shut your filthy mouths! You think you’re hot shit? Try cursing again!”

The chastised thugs slunk away. Guan Yu turned to the awed freshmen. “Don’t take their crap. So what if they’re seniors? Stand your ground!”

**Chapter 145: Take Me With You**

Guan Yu’s defiance electrified the freshmen. Even the dorm supervisor kowtowed to him—who *was* this guy?

Back in his room, Guan Yu resumed packing until a call interrupted.

“Guan Yu? It’s me… Du Xiaojuan. I’m under house arrest! Dad won’t let me return to school—he’s transferring me! Come sneak me out tonight!”

“What? Where?”

“I’ll hang a white tissue from my window at 9:30. Be there!”

Guan Yu blinked. *Eloping with this timid girl?* Yet her determination surprised him.

As he prepared to leave, hulking Niu Le blocked the door.

“Take me with you!”

“What? No! Stay in school!”

“But you’re quitting!”

“I can’t act or sing. You at least know ‘Two Tigers’!” Guan Yu deadpanned, referencing the children’s song.

Niu Le pouted as their roommates facepalmed.

**Chapter 146: Teach Him a Lesson**

Meanwhile, Wu Hao stewed in his office. His annual freshman shakedown ruined, he glared at complainers. “Drop it! He’s connected!”

“But Hao-ge, he disrespected you!”

“I said *enough*!” Wu Hao snapped, though humiliation burned. That memory of Guan Yu’s berserker rage still haunted him—no amount of backup could conquer that demon.

Reluctantly, his lackeys dispersed. Wu Hao sighed. *This year’s profits… gone.*

But Guan Yu, now hailed as a hero by freshmen, cared little. His path lay elsewhere—a phone call, a daring rescue, and perhaps an unlikely entourage. The real drama was just beginning.
