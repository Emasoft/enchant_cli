“I am certainly not joking. Even if I were, would I jest about Master Zhou’s life? His complexion clearly indicates an advanced stage of poisoning. The venom has reached his heart. He is beyond salvation.”

Guanyu continued, “I possess some knowledge of poisons. Master Zhou’s condition is now beyond remedy unless a Qi Master intervenes immediately to detoxify him. Otherwise, there is no hope.”

“Are you speaking the truth? I must return at once to inform them. There might still be time to save Master Zhou!” Yue Gao turned to leave, but Guanyu could not stop him.

“Brother Yue Gao, it’s not that I wish to hinder you. But rushing there now will only implicate you. If you’re falsely accused of poisoning a high-ranking official—a capital offense—would you not fear being entangled in this calamity?”

“But a human life is at stake! Knowing this, how can I stand idle? I respect your principles, but given my friendship with Master Zhou, I cannot watch him die without cause. I must warn him regardless of consequences.” Yue Gao grew increasingly urgent. “Guanyu, you should leave. Do not involve yourselves further.” With those words, he sprinted away.

Chapter 3693: Purchasing a Carriage (Part 2)

Upon entering the shop, a white-haired man in his sixties approached with a smile, eyeing Guanyu and Wang Xiaorong’s attire appraisingly.

“How may I assist you both today?”

“We seek to purchase a carriage. Might you recommend your finer models?” Guanyu inquired.

“Of course! Our Ao Di Carriage Workshop is renowned throughout ten villages. Ask anyone—our reputation precedes us. Nobles and officials all procure their carriages here.”

“Ao Di?” Guanyu blinked. “You mean Audi? Isn’t that... rather coincidental?” The name similarity struck him as borderline copyright infringement.

“Our workshop is called Ao Di, specializing in carriage-making for over twenty years. The elite exclusively patronize us,” the shopkeeper clarified.

Nodding, Guanyu requested, “We need a single-horse carriage for personal use. Could you show us your options?”

“Certainly! Our courtyard displays numerous models. Please follow me.” Noting their luxurious garments, the shopkeeper eagerly led them to the rear compound.

Merchants here judged by appearances. Ragged customers received neither warmth nor service—often met with dismissive remarks about “high prices” and suggestions to “try elsewhere.” But well-dressed patrons like Guanyu and Xiaorong enjoyed red-carpet treatment.

The sprawling backyard served as both workshop and showroom. Enclosed by two-meter walls, the thousand-square-meter space stored processed lumber and raw tree trunks. Artisans carved intricate patterns into wood using handheld tools, their craftsmanship entirely manual. To the left stood several finished carriages draped in sun-faded cloth.

“Please examine these specimens,” the shopkeeper gestured. “Should you prefer customization, select a style from these samples.”

“We require immediate purchase today. Do you have ready stock?”

“Most clients commission custom work, but these samples employ premium materials. You may choose from these.”

“How long would customization take?” Wang Xiaorong inquired, eyeing the weathered samples skeptically.

“With round-the-clock labor, five to six days.”

“That long?!”

While Xiaorong balked, Guanyu found the timeline reasonable given the handcrafted process. He examined the models—simple two-wheeled carts with boxy canopies, another with wooden roofs adorned by carvings, and an open-air design resembling imperial palanquins shaded by large umbrellas.

“Let’s select from these samples,” Guanyu suggested. “We can’t wait for custom work.”

“But these look worn. Suitable for personal use perhaps, but as a gift to Yue Gao?” Xiaorong wrinkled her nose.

The shopkeeper interjected, “We can refinish any chosen carriage with fresh paint—restoring its new appearance. Our materials are superior: axle elm for unbreakable durability, ash wood for lightweight flexibility. Observe the thickness compared to competitors’ flimsy imitations...”

Guanyu tuned out the technical spiel. Wood types meant little to him. “Your selection is limited. We’ll try elsewhere.”

At the next establishment, a forty-something proprietress with crepy neck skin greeted them flirtatiously. “Welcome! Our prices are fairest, quality unmatched.” She brushed Guanyu’s chest suggestively, her gravelly voice oozing false charm.

Chapter 3694: The Unreasonable Proprietress

Wang Xiaorong’s temper flared. “Let’s leave!” She dragged Guanyu outward as the woman called after him: “Handsome, stay for tea even if you don’t buy!”

“Shameless harlot!” Xiaorong whirled, venom dripping. “Dare solicit my man before me? I’ll teach—”

Guanyu clamped her mouth. “Calm yourself! This isn’t our territory.”

“Who you calling ‘harlot’?!” The matron shrieked. Six thugs emerged, blocking their exit. “Apologize or don’t leave!”

Xiaorong struggled against Guanyu’s grip. “Let me teach her!”

“Must we stoop to their level?” Guanyu pleaded. But the proprietress pressed harder: “Trash-talking brat! Apologize now!”

Onlookers gathered, shopkeepers siding with their longtime neighbor. Xiaorong spat: “I’d raze this dump if not for Guanyu!”

“Raze my shop?!” The woman cackled. “Try it, you little—”

Guanyu interjected coldly: “We’ve apologized. Persist, and consequences follow.” Golden qi flickered in his palm—a cultivator’s warning.

Undeterred, the matron sneered: “Think magic makes you special? Seize that bitch!”

As thugs advanced, Guanyu kicked the lead attacker, sending him sprawling. Xiaorong vibrated with rage behind him.

Chapter 3695: Broken Bones

“Last chance,” Guanyu warned icily. The matron snorted: “Teach them respect!”

When the thugs lunged, Guanyu moved like lightning—disarming two with precise strikes. Bones cracked under controlled blows, men collapsing howling. The crowd gasped; cultivators were rare here.

“Enough!” Guanyu’s voice froze the remaining attackers. He turned to the ashen-faced proprietress: “Seek trouble again, and your ‘shop’ becomes kindling.”

Dragging a fuming Xiaorong away, he sighed inwardly. Carriage shopping shouldn’t require breaking jaws.
