“Tsk… You actually saw through it. How dull. Haha! Master, your Jingang (Golden Vajra) has returned! Did you miss me?” A small bald figure materialized abruptly, as if emerging from thin air.

“Heh, missing you? Not particularly. When did you awaken? And that physical vessel—you’ve abandoned it?” Guan Yu’s brows furrowed slightly. The previous Jingang had exuded a profound, weighty presence, but now he felt almost insubstantial—as if he didn’t truly exist.

“Haha! Old Qin warned me long ago. This body of mine is now a weapon spirit’s form, utterly incompatible with a human vessel. I stubbornly refused to listen, and we both paid the price. Though I repaired that body, my spirit vessel was already depleted. This setback has left me worse off. I fear I can only assist you from within the Demon Subduing Staff from now on.”

Jingang maintained his cheerful grin, yet a tinge of bitterness and sorrow seeped into his voice. Clearly, he had attempted something unprecedented—and failed.

“It matters not. Your presence is enough. Let Elder Qin handle that vessel.” Guan Yu smiled faintly, his hand caressing the black staff. To him, Jingang was akin to a friend. As long as he remained, other concerns meant little.

“Enough sentimentality for now. Jingang, you’ve made the wisest choice. We primordial spirits need those vessels far more than you. If I slighted you earlier, I apologize. Now, I must rouse Old Mo—we’ll require his aid for what’s to come.” Qin Wuliang sighed deeply, his expression complex as he observed Jingang’s fading form. With a flick of his sleeve, he vanished alongside the pile of demonic soil and scattered artifacts, returning to the Demon Subduing Sect’s mountain gates.

“Jingang, what is Elder Qin preparing?” Moments later, Guan Yu watched as Qin Wuliang levitated mid-air, surveying the pocket dimension before inscribing talismanic symbols across the Thorn Demon Sect’s grounds. The process dragged on interminably, and Guan Yu soon grew bored—such arcana held no appeal for him. Yet Liu Shilei and Mo Ling observed with rapt fascination, clearly versed in these arts.

“Heh, isn’t it obvious? He intends to refine this place.” Jingang’s casual remark stunned Guan Yu. Refine? This entire area?

“Indeed, Sect Master. The Demon Subduing Sect’s Alchemy and Artifice Peak Elder, Yue Yan, pays his respects.” A figure materialized abruptly—the very body Jingang had once inhabited. Though the man stood motionless, Guan Yu felt crushing pressure radiating from him, a searing heat that scorched both flesh and soul. Just as the agony became unbearable, the sensation vanished. Before him stood a man wearing an apologetic smile that didn’t reach his mischievous eyes—this elder promised to be… challenging.

“Old Yue! What’s the meaning of this? A power play?” Before Guan Yu could speak, Jingang bristled. However Guan Yu had become sect master, Yue Yan’s disrespect struck as a personal affront.

“I—this subordinate wouldn’t dare. But the sect master position isn’t for just anyone. Though this youth seems adequate, I’ve yet to see what qualifies him to lead.” Yue Yan clearly held reservations about Jingang, even addressing him as “subordinate,” yet still refused to acknowledge Guan Yu’s authority.

“Elder Yue, understand this—I never sought the sect master role. If you desire it, extract the sect from my consciousness and establish it elsewhere. Let whoever wishes lead.” Guan Yu exhaled deeply as golden energy from the Great Demon Subduing Scripture coursed through him. When he looked up, terrifying golden light shimmered in his eyes—unintentional yet oppressive. Even Yue Yan faltered, instinctively averting his gaze.

“You… cultivate the Demon Subduing Scripture?” Yue Yan suddenly gripped Guan Yu’s shoulder, trembling with excitement as if beholding a rare treasure.

“Precisely. Old Yue, you know my temperament. I wouldn’t endorse him unless he could restore our sect’s glory.” Qin Wuliang interjected, understanding his old friend’s stubbornness—only concrete proofs would sway him.

“This bone age… Hah! Jingang, you’ve outdone yourself! To find such talent in this era of decayed arts… Yue Yan acknowledges the sect master! Forgive my earlier impertinence.” Physical contact revealed Guan Yu’s exceptional qualities. Though Yue Yan’s rebirth left him at the early Tribulation Transcendence stage, requiring three heavenly trials to reach Mahayana, he now recognized the youth’s potential.

“Naturally! Would my judgment err?” Jingang preened under the praise.

“Enough. Elder Yue, we’ll revisit the sect master matter later. My cultivation stems from the Demon Subduing Sect—I won’t betray that debt. Time will prove my worth.” Guan Yu frowned, uncertain about Yue Yan’s abrupt shift but welcoming the improved rapport.

Power held little allure for Guan Yu—though none disliked control, he disdained forcing it. Since embarking on this path, responsibilities had multiplied. The sect that forged him wouldn’t languish in obscurity under his watch.

**Chapter 1224: Collusion and Conflict**

“Elder Qin, you’re certain this can repair White Cloud Temple’s damaged ley lines?” Guan Yu stared incredulously at the crystalline orb in his hand.

“Without doubt. Though small, that primal world fragment yielded two Essence Cores—one for our sect, the other to repay White Cloud Temple. Without Wild Crane Daoist, you’d never have entered cultivation.” Qin Wuliang confirmed, teaching Guan Yu the activation method before retreating to seclusion.

After delivering the core to Wild Crane, Guan Yu awaited demonic factions in a villa near Linchuan University. The auction would be discreet—he trusted them to maintain secrecy.

Three days later, familiar faces arrived alongside strangers. Yin Qianji introduced representatives from five of the Seven Great Families—Li Qinghe, Zhao Mu, Yu Xuansong, and Duan Jiayao.

“Let’s begin. Seven Demon Heart Pills—they purify the demonic heart, sharpen spirit, suppress inner demons. Invaluable for cultivation. Bid.” Guan Yu unveiled jade bottles, knowing these pills’ rarity in an era of depleted resources.

“Giggle~ These are mine, darlings. Thirty elemental essences plus seven mystic woods.” Green Mist’s eyes gleamed—the pills perfectly suited her heart-centric cultivation.

“Apologies, sister. My brother needs these too. Thirty-five essences, ten heavy waters.” Duan Jiayao countered bluntly, her family’s influence negating deference.

The bidding escalated until Green Mist secured them at fifty essences and ten mystic wood seeds. Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed at the collusion but completed the transaction.

Next, Demon Drake Blood for body tempering drew lackluster bids. When Heavenly Pillar claimed it cheaply, Guan Yu’s patience snapped.

“The auction ends here. Leave.”

“You dare mock us?!” Li Qinghe erupted.

*Crack!*

A resounding slap sent Li Qinghe flying through the villa wall before he could finish. The assembly froze—none had seen Guan Yu move.

“You’ll all depart now.” Guan Yu remained seated, his casual display of power chilling the room. These young elites understood the skill required to humiliate Li Qinghe so effortlessly.

“Sect Master Guan… might I still purchase the Seven Orifices Life Pill?” Duan Jiayao ventured timidly, determined despite the tension.
