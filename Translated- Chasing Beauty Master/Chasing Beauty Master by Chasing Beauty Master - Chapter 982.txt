“You’re finally showing some sense, boy. This old man’s heart feels slightly comforted now. Don’t worry—your thirty percent share is guaranteed. I’ll arrange for the money to be transferred to you as soon as possible.” Old Master Yang chuckled. Since the other party had already demanded thirty percent, Yang Conghan couldn’t argue further.

Meanwhile, fearing unexpected complications if they delayed, Old Master Yang hurried to settle the matter and transfer the funds quickly to avoid trouble.

Guanyu and Xue Jing sat on a long wooden bench nearby. Guanyu asked, “Old Master, there’s something I’d like to ask you.”

Old Master Yang turned his head toward Guanyu, grinning as he pointed at him. “Questions from a rascal like you might go unanswered.”

Guanyu understood the implication and smiled. “Was it the Feng Family who won that treasure map in the end?”

Old Master Yang glanced at him, chuckling. “Hah! You said it yourself. I didn’t tell you anything.”

Guanyu laughed, grasping the message. In the martial world, there were rules: auction houses must keep the identities of consignors and buyers confidential if requested. Leaking such information would severely damage the auction house’s reputation and risk lawsuits.

Similarly, winning bidders could demand anonymity. Revealing their identities would invite immense trouble and legal battles. However, if someone uncovered a buyer’s identity through other means, the situation changed. Such matters were complex, but both sides typically had monitors to prevent foul play.

Old Master Yang recalled last year’s auction, where a buyer at the Yang Family Auction House purchased an insurance policy worth millions to safeguard his anonymity. If leaked, the Yang Family would owe tenfold compensation. The buyer, thinking himself clever, leaked his own identity through rumors, then sued the Yangs. After investigation, the Yangs’ formidable influence exposed his scheme. In the end, the buyer ended up compensating the Yangs heavily—a classic case of “scheming for gain but losing everything.”

Only a powerhouse like the Yangs dared offer such anonymity guarantees. Nowadays, most buyers didn’t bother hiding identities, as information often spread publicly. Typically, they simply warned the Yangs not to disclose their names, and the Yangs fiercely protected their privacy.

This reputation, built over decades, made buyers trust the Yangs deeply. By neither confirming nor denying, Old Master Yang made it clear: the Feng Family had won the treasure map.

**Chapter 2511: Old Age**

Guanyu inwardly smirked. The Fengs had taken a massive loss. He wondered how they’d react upon discovering the map was fake. Even if they realized it, they’d blame the Yangs, not him. Guanyu secretly hoped the Yangs and Fengs would clash, allowing him to reap the benefits. With the Fengs backed by the formidable Bill Family and the Yangs’ own might—including Yang Cheng, a Realm Venerable expert—the outcome was unpredictable.

Guanyu fantasized about both sides weakening each other, after which he’d aid the Yangs to crush the Fengs and seize the Eternal Demon Domain. Delighted the Fengs had taken the bait, he still wondered about the identity of the group that challenged them during the auction. Asking Old Master Yang now would be futile.

“I have matters to attend to later, so I’ll skip the chess game. I’ll take my leave now,” Guanyu said, standing.

“Stay for dinner! It’s been ages since you drank with this old man,” Old Master Yang urged.

Yang Conghan frowned. “No alcohol! Grandpa, I’ve forbidden you from drinking. Your health isn’t what it was. You must stop!”

Indeed, Guanyu noticed Old Master Yang’s declining vitality—a result of losing his cultivation. Years ago, he’d transferred all his power to save Yang Cheng, leaving his body frail. Yang Conghan strictly monitored his health.

“Bah! This old bones won’t last much longer. Denying me drink would make death bitter!” the old man joked.

“Don’t say such things!” Yang Conghan scolded, feigning anger. “You’ll live to a hundred! Never speak like that again, or I’ll ignore you forever!”

“Fine, fine! I’ll obey,” Old Master Yang sighed, then asked Guanyu, “Does Conghan’s temper trouble you in Qiaoyuan District?”

Guanyu glanced at her. “Not at all. She’s only domineering with you. She treats me kindly.”

The old man chuckled wryly. “Seems everyone bullies me. Guanyu, send Hanhan over sometime. I miss her chatter—it’s too quiet without her.”

Guanyu sensed genuine loneliness beneath the words. The once-vigorous patriarch now seemed aged. Wealth couldn’t fill the void left by absent family—Yang Cheng was always away, while Yang Conghan and Zhang Han lived distantly.

Yang Conghan, noticing her grandfather’s melancholy, clasped his hand. “I’ll move back tomorrow! I’ll keep you company every day.”

Old Master Yang stroked her hair tenderly. “Silly girl. Live your youth. Just visit when you can. I truly miss Hanhan…”

“I’ll bring her to stay with you today,” Guanyu offered promptly.

“But you have errands,” Yang Conghan said. “Let me fetch her.”

Guanyu nodded. “Good. But be cautious—the streets are chaotic with outsiders due to the treasure map. Avoid flashy cars.”

As Yang Conghan left, the old man joyfully ordered servants to prepare feasts for Hanhan’s return.

Guanyu and Xue Jing departed but didn’t head straight to Qiaoyuan District. After arranging protection for Yang Conghan, Guanyu drove to the western construction site—the Yu Gang’s gathering spot.

The warehouse, hastily decorated, now held fifty tables indoors and a dozen outside. Massive industrial fans hung from high windows to ventilate smoke from the evening’s barbecue feast.

Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo bustled about directing preparations. Spotting Guanyu, Wei rushed over. “Boss! The event starts at five. It’s only noon—rest up for tonight!”

Guanyu shrugged. “I’m fine. What are those fans for?”

“For the smoke!” Wei explained. “Fifty grills mean fifty charcoal pits. These’ll keep the air clear.”

Jia Bo added, “We’ve slaughtered ten cattle, twenty sheep, and have endless seafood. Tonight’s a feast!”

Guanyu approved. “Spare no expense. Our brothers deserve the best.”

Trucks arrived laden with alcohol—beer, spirits, everything. By 5:30 PM, the warehouse buzzed with sizzling meat and camaraderie. Guanyu sat centrally, a beer in hand.

“Brothers!” he declared. “Yu Gang’s success is yours! To show gratitude—” He downed the bottle in one go, met by roaring cheers.

Wei Hongwei announced bonuses. Initially planned at 1,000 yuan each, Guanyu raised it to 5,000, plus 20,000 for merit. The crowd erupted.

When Wei fretted about cash shortages, his girlfriend Yao Yao suggested mobile transfers. The solution delighted everyone.

As revelry continued, Guanyu noticed Jia Bo’s lingering glances at Xie Yulu—their unspoken romance amused the gang. Some whispered they’d nearly married after a pregnancy scare.

**Chapter 2512: Bottle in One Gulp**

The party raged on, meat and alcohol flowing freely. Guanyu, knowing his limits, toasted the crowd collectively. “To Yu Gang!” Three hundred bottles clinked, downed in unison.

Laughter and grease filled the air, fans whirring overhead. In that moment, the Yu Gang felt unstoppable—a brotherhood forged in fire and feast.
