Liu Shilei's voice softened as she said gently, "I'll wait for you. I called to tell you that Mo Ling has also come to the capital. Her family's here, so you should keep in touch with her. It's good to have someone looking out for you there. I worry about you being alone outside."

A warm feeling surged in Guan Yu's heart. He replied softly, "I understand, sis."

Mo Ling was right beside him anyway. How could she possibly take care of him? If anything, he needed to look after her.

After exchanging more pleasantries, Liu Shilei reluctantly ended the call.

Before Guan Yu could put his phone away, it rang again. A mysterious smile tugged at his lips as he answered. The voice from the other end sounded even more plaintive than Liu Shilei's: "Guan Yu, when are you coming back? I miss you so much."

"Xiaojuan, soon. It should only take a couple more days," Guan Yu comforted her.

It took considerable time before Du Xiaojuan's mood gradually stabilized. After hanging up, Guan Yu exhaled deeply. He hadn't been home for days and wondered how everyone was doing—his women and brothers.

Just as Guan Yu began feeling sentimental, his phone rang again. Seeing the caller ID, he chuckled wryly.

It seemed like they'd all conspired to call him today.

"Hello, hubby! Have you missed me these past few days? I'm dying to see you! Can't talk now—about to board the plane. We'll chat when I arrive!" Wen Qing's cheerful voice chimed from the receiver.

"What? Where are you going?" Guan Yu urgently asked.

"The capital."

The line went dead before he could respond.

Guan Yu's mind reeled. Why was Wen Qing coming to the capital?

Chapter 455: You Talk Too Much

"Why are you coming to the capital?" Guan Yu quickly demanded into the phone, but only a dial tone answered him.

He immediately tried calling back. "The number you have dialed is powered off."

"Turned off?" Guan Yu frowned slightly, shaking his head before pocketing his phone.

Leaning back on the sofa with his arms spread, he stared at the ceiling while Wen Qing's image filled his thoughts. Her sudden trip to the capital felt somehow connected to him.

His relationship with Wen Qing had begun with him carelessly taking her virginity, leaving him with an unreal sensation. To this day, he knew nothing substantial about her. This abrupt, inexplicable affection unsettled him—he simply wasn't accustomed to it.

Yet the genuine emotion radiating from Wen Qing's every gesture stirred his protective instincts. He couldn't determine her true position in his heart.

A wave of irritation surged. Rubbing his temples, Guan Yu forcibly cleared his mind.

Gurgle.

Glancing at his stomach, Guan Yu smiled bitterly. How could three women spend over two hours on a spa session? Had they forgotten about eating?

As if summoned, the trio's laughter drifted through the door. They entered just as another stomach rumble echoed through the room.

Lin Lin covered her mouth, completely unapologetic. "Younger brother, hungry already? Hasn't it only been a little while?"

Guan Yu rolled his eyes dramatically. "A little while? You've been pampering yourselves for two hours! I'm starving to death here!"

"Was it that long? If Mo Ling hadn't worried you'd get bored, I would've stayed longer. Palace-level service! This might be my only chance to experience it!" Lin Lin retorted with faux innocence.

Mo Ling shot her a glare. "Only someone with nothing better to do would worry about this pervert."

Guan Yu sniffed indifferently. "Sis, I'll just give you the membership card. Then you can come whenever. No need to overstay—I don't need this thing anyway."

Lin Lin teased, "Oh? Hand it over then! Let me show off in front of others."

Without hesitation, Guan Yu produced the card and placed it in her palm. "No need to stand on ceremony. These things don't interest me. Carrying it around just feels awkward."

Lin Lin stared in shock. "You're really giving this to me? This isn't something money can buy!"

Guan Yu shrugged lazily. "It's cumbersome."

Having navigated society's complexities for years, Lin Lin recognized his sincerity. She studied him deeply before joking, "Since little brother's so generous, big sister will accept. Tsk tsk, what an excellent brother I've acquired."

Guan Yu smiled without comment, changing the subject. "Shall we eat now?"

As the quartet followed Manager Li to the club's premier restaurant, Lin Lin deliberately lagged behind. Leaning close to Guan Yu's ear, she whispered playfully, "Remember what I said earlier? My man needs at least diamond membership. Your platinum status more than qualifies... care to consider me?"

Guan Yu stumbled mid-step, face darkening. Ignoring her, he hurried forward to walk beside Li Xi.

Lin Lin's laughter tinkled behind them.

Chapter 456: Husband?

At Beijing International Airport, a lightly dressed woman emerged. Her white down jacket and leggings accentuated her curves, while the Hermès scarf framed a face that halted travelers mid-stride—men collided with each other, captivated by Wen Qing's pheromone-like allure.

Taking a deep breath, she murmured, "Back again," her tone laced with nostalgic resignation.

Finding no familiar face in the crowd, disappointment clouded her features. "Called him specially, yet he's not here to greet me. Hmph! Probably flirting with some woman."

"Wen Qing."

The warm voice made her stiffen. Turning, she saw Yang Yang approaching, her expression cooling.

"Surveillance on point as ever," she remarked acidly.

Yang Yang maintained his smile. "Anything concerning you deserves full attention."

"Seen me? Then leave. I have matters." She moved past him.

"Does anything outweigh visiting Elder Wen? He's been awaiting your return."

Wen Qing sighed internally. "Husband, seems I'll have to delay seeing you."

"What was that?" Yang Yang asked.

"None of your concern," she snapped, striding toward the waiting car destined for Zhongnanhai.

During the ride, Yang Yang probed, "Returning specifically to see Elder Wen?"

"No."

"Then why—"

"Attend the charity gala." Her fleeting smile—a blooming night-blooming cereus—left him entranced.

"But you've never cared for such events! Especially flying from N City—"

"Do you ever stop talking?"

Chapter 457: Platinum Privilege

Lin Lin embraced luxury to the fullest. After dining, she continued indulging in the club's amenities. Guan Yu reluctantly accompanied them until evening departure. Li Xi rode his Mercedes while Lin Lin drove off in her Maserati with Mo Ling.

Though returning early, Li Yuanshan had already retired—his intentions clear. The living room's atmosphere grew taut when Guan Yu and Li Xi found themselves alone.

Stealing glances at Li Xi, Guan Yu's blood heated remembering that morning's intimate encounter—the memory of her black lace lingerie vivid. Though subtle, Li Xi noticed his gaze. Flushing, she bid a terse "goodnight" and retreated upstairs.

The following two days saw Guan Yu treating Zhao Jing'er while recuperating at the villa. Until fully healed, he dared not venture out—Lin Dong posed too grave a threat.

Standing before a mirror, Guan Yu adjusted his tailored black suit. "Must I wear this? Feels constricting."

Li Xi, resplendent in white evening gown that accentuated her curves, replied calmly, "It complements my attire. You'll adjust."

At the five-star hotel hosting the charity gala, luxury vehicles crowded the entrance. Guan Yu eyed the towering structure warily.

"Yusheng Group's property," Li Xi explained. "Security's stringent—no need for concern."

"You see through everything," he admitted ruefully.

"Perhaps I could assist," she offered.

He shook his head. "Beyond help."

The grand ballroom already buzzed with elites when they arrived. All eyes converged on the striking pair—particularly burning male gazes targeting Guan Yu for "defiling" their ice goddess.

"Regretting coming?" Guan Yu whispered. "I've become target practice."

Before Li Xi could respond, a sneer sounded behind them: "If it isn't the cockroach who survives everywhere."

Guan Yu turned to face Yang Yang. "Surprised your brother didn't warn you about provoking me?"

"Would you dare make scene here?" Yang Yang goaded.

Tension crackled until a feminine voice pierced through:

"Hubby! Finally found you!" Wen Qing emerged, beaming. "Missed you so much!"
