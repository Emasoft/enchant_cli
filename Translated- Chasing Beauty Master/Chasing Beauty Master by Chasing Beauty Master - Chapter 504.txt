When someone cried out about unfairness, Guan Yu couldn't help but laugh uproariously. "Old chap," he said, "are you jesting with me? Though young, I've roamed the rivers and lakes for years! This is the first time I've heard anyone demand fairness in our world!"

His words silenced the crowd. Though many privately agreed, none showed it. Guan Yu stood alone against factions – provoking them would cost dearly. Moreover, the Crystal Toad in his grasp made him their common target. Alliances could form and fracture later.

Suddenly, a voice cut through the tension. "Youth, you must see your predicament. United, we could pluck that toad from your hand as easily as taking candy from a babe. We offer two choices."

Guan Yu eyed the speaker – a pampered young master in opulent robes, barely twenty. He needed no divination to guess the "choices": surrender the toad or die resisting. Neither appealed. He'd promised Clan Leader Alan to retrieve this relic, and personal pride forbade surrender.

"Enough," Guan Yu snapped coldly. "Your choices stink worse than three-day-old fish. Want the toad? Come claim it!"

The young aristocrat from Jinzhou City trembled under Guan Yu's glare. Though mediocre in talent, expensive elixirs had boosted him to Advanced Sword Master rank. To Guan Yu? Less than nothing. He'd sparred with Peak Great Sword Masters and lived. Sword Kings might give pause... but not today.

As those ice-cold eyes pinned him, the young master's bravado crumbled into primal fear. This wasn't a man before him – but a predator. Yet pride held him fast. "Wretched cur!" he blustered, drawing his azure steel blade. "I'll teach you manners!"

Guan Yu sighed. "Vanity truly is a killer. You know you're outmatched. Without this audience, you'd be groveling. Since you court death..." Blue mist coalesced around his hands as the crowd gasped – a mage!

The fool charged, aiming to strike before the spell formed. At ten centimeters, Guan Yu uttered: "Break."

The languid elements exploded. Bones crunched as the youth flew thirty meters, painting the hillside crimson. Guan Yu shook his head. "Impatient. Had you waited, your corpse might've been art."

The crowd quaked. To casually kill an Advanced Sword Master? What monster stood before them?

"Next?" Guan Yu's gaze swept the crowd, strategy clear – cull the bold to cow the rest. Murmurs rippled. None dared meet his eyes... until a melodic voice rang out.

"I shall."

The crowd parted, revealing a slender figure with pointed ears – an elf! Gasps erupted. "A magic-wielding human versus an elven spellcaster!" "Since when do elves meddle here?"

Guan Yu recognized him instantly – Locke, Elven Guard Captain. Against all odds, the elf stood unafraid amidst potential enemies.

"You actually came," Guan Yu smirked.

Locke returned a frosty smile. "You're here. Why not I?"

"But this is human territory. Don't fear mob justice?"

The elf glanced at the silent crowd. "Will they aid you... or me?"

Guan Yu stayed silent. Locke pressed closer. "Guan Yu – human masquerading as dragon, deceiving our elders. Were I clan leader, you'd be carrion."

"Ah, but I know your secret too," Guan Yu countered. "The World Tree's corruption... your doing?"

Locke's composure flickered. "What else do you know?"

"Enough to bury you. Care to gamble?"

The elf laughed harshly. "Join me. Surrender the toad, and I'll make you Guard Captain. All elven beauties – even Amy – could be yours."

Guan Yu's disgust deepened. "Tempting... but I prefer freedom."

Locke's mask shattered. "Fool! I offered paradise!" Violet light erupted around him as the crowd murmured – Magus-tier power! "Perish then!"

"Earth Tier Art – Sixfold Annihilation!" Six violet orbs streaked from all angles. Guan Yu barely dodged, the impact cratering stone where he'd stood.

Before he recovered, another barrage came. "Damned spammer!" Guan Yu cursed, leaping aside. But Locke anticipated, closing in mid-air.

Guan Yu unleashed his trump card – Nascent Soul empowerment from another realm. "Gale Slash!" A blue arc forced Locke back, buying seconds to flee toward cliffs.

A thousand violet blades pursued. Most missed – one pierced his back. Though his enhanced body absorbed the blow, agony lanced through him as he tumbled downslope.

Clutching the struggling Crystal Toad to his chest, Guan Yu heard pursuers: "Don't let him escape!"

Gritting through pain, he reached the precipice. Five enemies arrived, Locke gloating behind them. "Run now, dragon impostor!"

Bloodied but unbowed, Guan Yu faced the abyss. His Gravitational System mastery – untested at such heights – was his only hope. Better shattered bones than capture.

"Come then!" he roared at the cliff's edge. "Let's see who flies true!"
