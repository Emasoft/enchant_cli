It was only because Old Master Zhao had found Zhao Jing’er that such a girl with a stubborn, nearly incurable illness had been nurtured for eighteen years. For anyone else, this would have been impossible. This was a tug-of-war with the King of Hell itself!

Guan Yu rubbed his nose awkwardly, turned to glance calmly at Zhao Jing’er, then took a deep breath and said slowly, “Old Master, you overstate matters. Since I’ve agreed to help you save her, I will certainly do so. However…”

“However what? Name any condition!” The old man’s eyes blazed with hope. How could he not be excited, not rejoice? Conditions meant nothing now. Even the most impossible tasks would be tackled with every ounce of his strength. Over the past decade, every shred of love he might have poured into his own children or descendants had been wholly devoted to Zhao Jing’er.

In this moment, Old Master Zhao was not a revered revolutionary elder, nor the illustrious founding statesman whom even the current national leaders treated with utmost respect. Now, he was simply Zhao Jing’er’s grandfather—a doting old man willing to sacrifice everything for his granddaughter.

Guan Yu waved his hands earnestly. “Old Master, I’m not setting conditions. You misunderstand. It’s… this young lady’s condition is truly dire. The treatment effects won’t manifest quickly. This will be a prolonged process—perhaps three to five months, maybe a year or two, even longer…”

This wasn’t Guan Yu trying to frighten the old man with exaggerations. Zhao Jing’er’s body had deteriorated far beyond mere heart issues. Over a decade of insufficient blood supply and deficient blood components had caused all her bodily functions to slowly degrade. When every organ operates at a slowed pace for years, systemic collapse becomes inevitable. Though the root cause was her heart, the damage was now universal.

Every organ in Zhao Jing’er’s body was on the brink of shutdown, functioning in a near-dormant state. A few days later, even Guan Yu’s arrival might have been futile.

After all, the upgraded healing technique now only achieved forty percent efficacy. For minor injuries or surface wounds, this percentage worked wonders. But for chronic, entrenched illnesses like this, “forty percent” remained theoretical—requiring ten treatments, or a hundred. This had already been proven with Mother Luo’s nephritis.

Moreover, energy constraints loomed. The graver the illness, the more energy consumed. Guan Yu’s current reserves were insufficient for such severe treatment. A perfect healing session might achieve that forty percent, but energy shortages could reduce it to a tenth—or less.

This was an unprecedented, Herculean task.

“Time isn’t an issue!” Old Master Zhao declared fervently. “Any condition—anything you need—I’ll fulfill it! Can you begin treatment now?”

Initially, the old man had only half-believed in Guan Yu’s qigong healing. Only desperation had driven him to seek out this young man in N City. But after hearing Guan Yu’s precise diagnosis—matching every detail of Jing’er’s condition—conviction replaced doubt. This youth possessed real skill!

If Guan Yu could cure his granddaughter, nothing else mattered. That was Old Master Zhao’s ironclad resolve.

Guan Yu nodded. Future treatments could wait. Right now, the girl’s body teetered on the edge—every moment counted.

“Remove these IV lines and equipment. Leave only the oxygen,” Guan Yu instructed the nurses, pointing at the tangle of machines.

The nurses stared in shock. “Remove them?”

“Yes. Remove them,” Guan Yu repeated calmly.

A thirty-something female doctor glared at him. “Are you mad? These machines are keeping her alive! Without them, she’d die within minutes! Do you even understand what you’re doing?”

Guan Yu met her gaze coolly. “Tell me—do these machines cure her? Can they make her well?”

“They… sustain her vitality.”

“Exactly. They sustain. I intend to heal. Do you grasp the difference?”

The nurse turned helplessly to Old Master Zhao, who hesitated painfully. Yet with no other hope in sight, he steeled himself.

“Remove them!” he barked, slamming his cane against the floor.

The nurses obeyed, though resentment simmered. As the machines fell silent, Guan Yu pulled a chair to the bedside. “Everyone else, leave. I need silence.”

Old Master Zhao promptly shooed the room clear, remaining himself to watch intently.

Beneath the blanket, Guan Yu’s hand encountered skin cold as ice. Only its soft resilience confirmed this was a living body. Tracing up her arm, his fingers paused at her shoulder, then drifted downward—

And settled on the rise of her chest.

Zhao Jing’er’s eyes widened in alarm as Guan Yu’s palm pressed against her. Though frail, her figure held surprising fullness. Guan Yu gave her a reassuring look.

“Qigong healing. Breathe calmly.”

Adjusting his position, his thumb brushed a sensitive peak. Jing’er gasped, cheeks flaming, but Guan Yu maintained professional detachment.

“A physician’s duty knows no taboo,” he said preemptively as Old Master Zhao stirred.

In truth, Guan Yu felt no improper intent. The upgraded healing technique now surged like a river compared to its former trickle—vivid blue currents intertwining with red energy. As it flowed through his palm, an odd phenomenon occurred: the thin hospital gown seemed to dissolve beneath his touch, leaving direct contact with chilled, silken skin.

Startled, Guan Yu instinctively flexed his fingers—confirming the shocking reality. He now cupped bare flesh, impossibly soft and resilient.

Zhao Jing’er whimpered, sweat beading her nose—a miracle in itself, as her sluggish metabolism had never permitted perspiration. The treatment was working: her blood flow accelerated, organs stirring from dormancy.

After several seconds, Guan Yu withdrew his damp hand, discreetly sniffing fingers that carried a milky fragrance. Jing’er shot him a mortified glance but reported to her grandfather: “I… feel better. Breathing’s easier.”

Old Master Zhao nearly wept with joy. “Marvelous! Rest now, Guan Yu—you’ve earned it!”

Guan Yu addressed Jing’er solemnly: “This is merely stabilization. Full recovery will require years of treatment.” He emphasized this to prepare her for future intimate sessions.

“However long it takes!” the old man vowed. Then, abruptly: “You’re in university, yes? Where?”

The upgraded healing technique astonished Guan Yu. Previously, treating Mother Luo drained him within seconds. Now, after five continuous seconds, energy still surged powerfully.

Noticing Jing’er’s flushed face and bitten lip, he chided himself. *Focus! This is medical treatment, not...*

Closing his eyes, he channeled energy into her heart’s clogged pathways. Soon, he withdrew—palm slick with sweat.

Jing’er glared accusingly at her grandfather, who misinterpreted her distress: “Does it work? You look better!”

“I… can breathe better,” she admitted, shooting Guan Yu a conflicted glance.

Guan Yu pressed: “Your condition remains critical. What I did today merely halted deterioration.”

Old Master Zhao waved this aside. “Years mean nothing! By the way—” His eyes gleamed with sudden inspiration. “Where’s your university? Should Jing’er live there with you for treatments?”
