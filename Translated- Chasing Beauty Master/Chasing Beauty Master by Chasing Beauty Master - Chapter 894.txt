Guan Yu knew that Feng Xihu (West Lake) had likely secured her position at the local police station through her own efforts. Had the Feng family or the Bill clan used their wealth to intervene, she wouldn't still be doing menial tasks at the precinct.

While this police department appeared strict, sufficient bribes could make it operate no differently from its counterparts in Huaxia – albeit less egregiously.

**Chapter 2291: Beyond Comparison**

Guan Yu understood Feng Xihu’s situation clearly. If either her family or the Bills had truly invested resources, she wouldn’t remain stuck with janitorial duties. The same systemic flaws existed here as in Huaxia, merely less pronounced.

“Oh, let’s get started then. Ask whatever you need. I’ll answer fully,” Guan Yu said tersely, eager to conclude this interrogation.

Jinhua had recognized Feng Xihu the moment she stepped out of the patrol car. Having met her previously at a banquet with Yang Conghan, Jinhua recalled her distinctly.

Lai Li watched in quiet astonishment. Though she’d known Guan Yu briefly, his extraordinary charisma – that indefinable quality rendering women helplessly drawn – became glaringly apparent as this stunning policewoman openly flirted with him while he maintained polite distance. Rumors of his “harem” back in Huaxia resurfaced in her mind. Were all other men on earth extinct? Her heartbeat quickened traitorously despite herself.

Glancing at A’Cai beside her, Lai Li sighed inwardly. Though the youth possessed a sunny demeanor, he paled in comparison to Guan Yu’s commanding presence. Suppressing improper thoughts, she shook her head and retreated to the kitchen for fruit.

Feng Xihu conducted her “official inquiries” with thoroughness bordering on excess, prolonging the session unnecessarily. Her lingering gaze upon departure betrayed unresolved feelings she’d believed conquered.

As dusk fell, Guan Yu stretched lazily. “Lai Li, let’s dine out. You must be hungry.”

Before Lai Li could respond, Jinhua chirped, “McDonald’s! Authentic American burgers must trump Huaxia’s!”

Their plans halted abruptly when the door burst open.

“Laila?!” The group gasped in unison, uncertain if this was another impostor.

The genuine Laila froze upon seeing the crowd. “Are you hurt?” she demanded, rushing to embrace her sister after spotting the departing police car.

After explanations about the day’s chaos involving a doppelgänger kidnapper targeting A’Cai, Laila reluctantly joined their dinner outing.

The meal proved lively, particularly Jinhua’s consumption of two burgers and a steak. “I’ve got anti-fat secrets!” she boasted when questioned.

Returning late to their rented villa, Jinhua began brewing foul-smelling medicinal paste while Guan Yu reviewed Chen Xiaona’s incriminating recording with A’Cai.

“Tomorrow night,” Guan Yu declared. “We dismantle that trafficking den.”

**Chapter 2292: All That Rots**

A’Cai paled. “Alone? That’s suicide!”

“Not alone,” Guan Yu assured. “Striking first during their complacent night shift is strategic. Delay risks retaliation.”

Though uneasy, A’Cai trusted his mentor’s judgment. The trafficking ring’s lax nighttime security – revealed through Chen Xiaona’s intel – presented their best opportunity.

As midnight approached, Jinhua presented her malodorous remedy. “Apply this without scratching,” she ordered before retiring.

The stinking brown sludge burned hotter with each passing moment on A’Cai’s skin. Binding his hands to resist itching, he focused on cultivation despite the agony.

Guan Yu observed approvingly – such discipline hinted at great potential.

**Chapter 2293: Countdown**

Upstairs, he found Jinhua sprawled across princess-themed bedding, television blaring as she slept. The juxtaposition of childish decor and her lethal skills never ceased to amuse him.

Jetlagged, they awoke mid-afternoon to find A’Cai already meditating, his scars visibly faded.

During their belated meal, A’Cai hesitated – years of scavenging leftovers in the trafficking compound left him unaccustomed to dining alongside others.

“Eat,” Guan Yu commanded gently, aware of the youth’s trauma. Tonight’s operation would begin his redemption.

The clock ticked toward reckoning.
