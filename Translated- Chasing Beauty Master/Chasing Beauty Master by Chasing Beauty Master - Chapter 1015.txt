Young Master Feng gritted his teeth and said coldly, "Damn it! Since there's no retreat, we might as well fight to the death." He began directing his bodyguards to scale the walls, thinking that since he'd already offended Guan Yu, he might as well commit fully. Perhaps they could break through the gates, and even if they failed, he'd drag Bill Lin down with him.

"Once Guan Yu comes after me, Bill Lin will suffer too!" Having made up his mind, Young Master Feng summoned the bodyguard captain. "Gather everyone beneath the main wall immediately. Prepare to storm the courtyard. Even if you're struck by bricks, you'll die inside those walls! Understood?"

Furious and desperate, Young Master Feng's orders made the captain tense. "Young Master, shouldn't we send the bulldozers?"

"That bastard Bill Lin blocked the mountain path! The bulldozers can't reach us!" Feng roared.

"What?" The captain paled. "Then how do we retreat? There's only one road!"

"Retreat is impossible," Feng said icily. "Either we kill Guan Yu, or we all perish here." Despair tinged his voice now. Knowing Guan Yu wouldn't show mercy, he resolved to fight with everything left.

Cornered men grow bold. This was Feng's situation - facing death either way, he'd take others down with him.

Though reluctant, the bodyguards assembled beneath the wall at their captain's bellowed command: "Charge! Storm the courtyard! Even if bricks shatter your skulls, die inside those walls! Move!"

Inside the courtyard, Guan Yu had long anticipated this assault. Standing by the brick pile, he remarked laughingly, "How foolish. Were it me, I'd have breached this place effortlessly by now."

As he spoke, a mass of heads appeared atop the wall. Xue Jing took aim and hurled a half-brick with lethal precision.

**Chapter 2595: Bricks Exhausted**

The air filled with flying bricks, smashing into attackers amidst agonized screams. Feng's bodyguards fought desperately, many leaping into the courtyard despite head wounds. Yet those struck by Xue Jing and the Bearded Man's projectiles fared worse - the bricks' tremendous force knocked victims backward, leaving them writhing on the ground.

Wei Hongwei and Xiao Bai's throws proved weaker and less accurate. Though Guan Yu had lost his cultivation, his brick-hurling skill nearly matched Xue Jing's, honed from Yang Conghan's dagger-throwing tutelage. Still, the frenzied assault continued unabated.

Frowning at the onslaught, Guan Yu instructed, "Xiao Bai, guard the gate. Disable anyone approaching, but don't kill."

Xiao Bai's speed-focused cultivation made him ideal for this - rapid strikes could neutralize multiple attackers. Twenty-odd invaders already lay groaning in the courtyard, only five still standing. These "lucky" survivors froze when they saw the composed figure blocking the gate.

"Don't make me hurt you," Xiao Bai said, twirling a dagger. "Leave now, or I'll throw you out."

New arrivals ignored the warning, charging blindly toward the gate. Xiao Bai's fist crumpled the first attacker's chest. Others hesitated, then rushed forward in unison. Methodically, Xiao Bai disabled each one, attempting to emulate the Bearded Man's effortless throws. Straining, he managed to hurl one lightweight guard over the wall, knocking down two others. "I'll never match that brute strength," he muttered, shaking his head.

Guan Yu chuckled while lobbing bricks. "The Bearded Man's throwing technique leaves Xiao Bai breathless."

The Bearded Man guffawed. "The fool chose a scrawny target and still struggled! Pathetic!"

Their banter drowned beneath anguished wails. Soon, Guan Yu's stockpile depleted. Nearly forty invaders remained standing, with fifty total in the courtyard. The tide had turned.

"They're out of bricks!" someone shouted.

Guan Yu sighed ruefully. "Xiao Bai, fall back. Let them open the gate."

With no projectiles left, defending became pointless. As the gates creaked open, Young Master Feng retreated fearfully while Bill Lin marveled at his pawns' success. The courtyard easily accommodated their combined forces - Feng's fifty survivors and Bill Lin's hundred-strong contingent.

Guan Yu's group lounged casually at a pavilion, sipping water. Bill Lin's gaze locked onto Xue Jing, his jaw slackening. "A celestial beauty!" he breathed, advancing unconsciously until her scornful glare made him check himself.

**Chapter 2596: Changed Attitudes**

Bill Lin straightened, adopting false decorum. "My apologies for this unpleasantness. We're here merely to discuss acquiring your treasure map fragment."

Guan Yu didn't look up from his cup. "First, let Feng kowtow before me."

"You ask the impossible!" Bill Lin protested, though privately dismissing Feng's dignity. His attention kept straying to Xue Jing, calculating how to possess this peerless beauty.

Guan Yu's voice turned glacial. "Those you brought? Paper tigers. The real danger lies at your feet."

Bill Lin glanced nervously at his remaining fighter, Ha Da. Swallowing fear, he tried negotiation: "Name your price for the map."

When Bill Lin offered a paltry sum, Wei Hongwei spat his water. "You insult us! That's beggar's coin!"

Guan Yu smiled dangerously. "The map's not for sale. But since you've come..." His gaze swept the courtyard, strategy unfolding.
