Xue Yingfeng was a straightforward man. Seeing that Sun Heizi couldn’t put down the jade qilin in his hands, he decided against beating around the bush. Since he was already here, there was no point wasting time. Cutting straight to the chase, he said, “Old Hei, the reason I’m here today is to ask a favor of you.”

“No need for formalities between us. Just say what’s on your mind,” Sun Heizi replied casually.

“You must know Guan Yu, right?” Xue Yingfeng probed. At the mention of Guan Yu’s name, Sun Heizi’s face darkened. “Why bring him up?”

“Well, the truth is… Guan Yu is my son-in-law,” Xue Yingfeng paused before continuing. “I heard Guan Yu beat Sun Xu quite severely, but Sun Xu kidnapped Guan Yu’s woman first. I’d like to know your thoughts on this.”

“Guan Yu is your son-in-law?” Sun Heizi’s expression grew stormier, his tone icy. “Even if he kidnapped his woman, that doesn’t justify beating Xu’er so badly he’s still unconscious in the hospital! I don’t care who Guan Yu is—sooner or later, I’ll avenge Xu’er!”

As he spoke, Sun Heizi slammed his fist violently onto the desk. Sensing slim chances of reconciliation, Xue Yingfeng still pressed on: “Scuffles between youngsters are normal. Why take it so seriously?”

Though Sun Heizi’s fierce appearance might intimidate others, Xue Yingfeng—a trained martial artist—remained unfazed. Smiling placatingly, he said, “Old Hei, don’t be hasty. It seems Guan Yu did go too far this time. That’s precisely why I’m here to apologize on his behalf.”

“I don’t need apologies, and I won’t accept them. Once I finish urgent matters, I’ll settle scores with that little beast!”

“Old Hei, if you’ll accept it—here’s five million. I hope you’ll show mercy?” Xue Yingfeng produced a check from his pocket, its string of zeros confirming the sum. “This is for you. No need to stand on ceremony.”

Though the Sun family was wealthy, five million was no small amount—enough to tempt even them. When Sun Heizi remained silent, Xue Yingfeng stood and placed the check before him. “Old Hei, could you let this matter slide?”

Sun Heizi, who had been lovingly caressing the jade qilin, gritted his teeth and returned it to its box. “Old Xue, we’re old friends. I won’t mince words—take your things and leave as you came.”

Xue Yingfeng hadn’t anticipated such resolve. Though aware the Suns stood no chance against Guan Yu, he knew reasoning with Sun Heizi now was futile. Sighing, he shook his head. “Old Hei, let me offer friendly advice: you can’t contend with Huayu Group.”

Sun Heizi visibly stiffened, finally confirming Guan Yu’s identity. Rumors about Guan Yu’s background had circulated, including speculation he was Huayu Group’s young chairman—now verified.

Yet even against Huayu’s chairman, Sun Heizi vowed to fight. He wouldn’t let Xu’er’s beating go unanswered. Xue Yingfeng left the jade qilin but took back the check. Having fulfilled his duty to Guan Yu, there was nothing more to say. Let Sun Heizi keep the trinket as a warning.

Meanwhile, Du Xiaojuan had approached City A’s mayor through considerable connections. The selection of Kaihuang High’s new principal required high-level meetings, leaving little attention for Sun Xu’s case. Reassured by the mayor’s neutral stance, Du Xiaojuan felt confident the authorities would turn a blind eye.

Guan Yu, summoned by Jones, arrived at the construction site on Ping’an Street. The scene differed markedly from previous visits—Jones stood with over a hundred gathered subordinates, all psychic cultivators. Guan Yu marveled inwardly: over a hundred practitioners! Regardless of individual strength, this was a formidable force. Scanning the crowd—pseudo-psychics mixed with true experts—he approached Jones, awed by the organization’s might.

Midway, Jones met him, her beautiful face radiant. Whispering, she said, “Guan Yu, I planned to hand you the organization directly but feared losing key members. So I devised an alternative.”

**Chapter 1984: Defiance**

Regardless of individual strength, this was undeniably a powerful force. As Guan Yu marveled at Jones’ organization, he continued toward her. Meeting him halfway, Jones took his hand and announced to the crowd: “Everyone, today I announce that Guan Yu—my man—is now Second-in-Command of the Free Organization, wielding full authority.”

Outcry erupted, particularly among men who’d joined pursuing Jones’ beauty. To retain talent, Jones remained nominal leader while elevating Guan Yu. Though willing to abandon the organization for him, she couldn’t discard years of effort lightly.

“We only follow you, Boss! Why should he be Second?” someone shouted.

Jones explained, “This isn’t favoritism. Guan Yu’s strength justifies his position. Challenge him—if you win, you take the role.”

Murmurs spread. Some recognized Guan Yu as this year’s city taekwondo champion. Others dismissed him: “Some nobody steals our Boss and position? I challenge him!”

The crowd parted for Ji Ge—a mid-level Second Zenith expert. Rough-looking with stubble and tattered clothes, he resembled a beggar. Jones approved the match.

Guan Yu assessed his opponent. Defeating this elder would cement his position. After courteous greetings, they faced off. Ji Ge opened with swift energy blasts. Guan Yu’s egg-shaped shield deflected some; others gashed steel barrels behind him.

Ji Ge closed in with blistering strikes, overwhelming Guan Yu’s defenses. Just as defeat seemed imminent, Guan Yu detonated his shield—the explosion catching Ji Ge off-guard. Following with a flying kick and precise dagger throw, Guan Yu pinned Ji Ge’s shadow to a pillar with a blade at his throat.

The crowd gasped. Coughing blood, Ji Ge conceded: “Thank you… for mercy.” Guan Yu then healed his leg meridians before medics arrived. Though exhausted, Guan Yu had proven himself.

**Chapter 1985: Second-in-Command**

Watching the battle, Jones grew concerned. Why was Guan Yu struggling? Unaware his cultivation was sealed, she’d assumed invincibility. Yet he’d triumphed through wit and speed.

As medics took Ji Ge away, Jones whispered, “Your power… it’s diminished?” Guan Yu’s weary nod confirmed her suspicion. The road ahead promised greater challenges, but for now, the Free Organization had its new Second.
