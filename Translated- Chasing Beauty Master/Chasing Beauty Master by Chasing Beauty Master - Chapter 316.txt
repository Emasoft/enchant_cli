He jerked his head to the sides and saw Gao Wei lying beside him, finally allowing his heart to settle! To his delight, the baton that had fallen with them wasn't lost—it lay right between them.

This was truly a lifesaver!

Guan Yu struggled to inch his body toward the baton. Though the object lay mere inches away, it took him over three hours to reach it. Sweat drenched his face, but his efforts weren't in vain—his fingers finally brushed the baton.

With great effort, he activated the switch.

*Zzzzt...*

The baton emitted a crackling sound upon contacting his body, sparks flickering at the touchpoint. Guan Yu's body desperately absorbed the electricity, causing excess energy to leak out.

Like sweet spring water in a desert or ice under scorching sun, Guan Yu greedily absorbed the energy. His body felt bathed in spring breeze, an indescribable pleasure.

But joy was fleeting!

The baton's charge soon depleted. Though it couldn't fully restore Guan Yu, it at least granted him mobility—enough for now!

Stretching, Guan Yu hurried to Gao Wei's side. Activating his scanning system, invisible waves enveloped her body, feeding information directly into his mind.

His expression grew graver by the second!

**Chapter 798: Modern Version of "Waiting by the Stump for Rabbits"**

Gao Wei's injuries were severe—essentially, no part of her body remained intact.

Though multiple fractures weren't immediately fatal, the broken rib piercing her lung posed mortal danger, compromising breathing and causing internal bleeding.

This was already fortunate under dire circumstances.

Without Guan Yu using gravity and healing systems to protect her, Gao Wei would have shared Zhan Shouwang's fate—shattered upon impact.

Guan Yu faced a dilemma!

While Gao Wei's injuries were treatable through his systems, the critical issue was energy shortage.

The baton's charge only partially restored him. Now, he could only sparingly use scanning and pet systems—overusing gravity or healing systems risked fatal energy depletion in the wilderness.

After contemplation, Guan Yu knelt, placing hands on Gao Wei's chest. The ancient coin in his mind glowed dimly as healing energy flowed into her heart and lungs.

Soon, cold sweat drenched Guan Yu's forehead, his pallor returning.

He withdrew once stabilizing Gao Wei's condition.

Though temporarily safe, her wounds could worsen, forcing Guan Yu to seek energy sources.

Time pressed. After creating a makeshift bed in a cave, Guan Yu embarked on his search.

Hours passed fruitlessly until he discovered Zhan Shouwang's corpse.

Standing over the body, Guan Yu pondered. The bullet hole in Zhan Shouwang's forehead brought no satisfaction—only confusion. Why had this assassin been killed?

Shaking his head, Guan Yu left. Tragedy had claimed its rightful recipient.

At dusk, desperate for energy-rich food, he hunted—leading to a comical chase through twilight forests.

"Damn fatty rabbit! When I catch you..." Guan Yu panted, collapsing exhausted.

Suddenly, he remembered his pet system. Grinning, he activated it—the rabbit froze mid-chase, then sprinted into his arms.

"Troublesome pest!" Guan Yu growled, triumphantly carrying his dinner.

Modern "stump-waiting" indeed! By nightfall, he'd captured three rabbits and two pheasants using his systems.

Returning to the cave, he roasted his quarry.

*Burp...*

Satiated, Guan宇 prepared for tomorrow's challenges.

**Chapter 800: Treating Wounds**

Life brimmed with surprises.

Yesterday's despair transformed into hope. After exhaustive efforts, Guan Yu secured remaining honeycombs.

Gazing at Gao Wei's pale face, he focused healing energy on her fractured ribs.

Two sleepless days passed, ten honeycombs consumed. Finally, Gao Wei's ribs partially healed, breathing normalized.

"You... survived?" Gao Wei whispered tearfully upon awakening.

"Thanks to you," she murmured, blushing as Guan宇 tended her needs.

Thus began their wilderness convalescence—a testament to resilience and unconventional medicine.
