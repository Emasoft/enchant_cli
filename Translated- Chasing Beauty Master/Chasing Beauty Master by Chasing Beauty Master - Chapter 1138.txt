“Young Master Bill, you certainly have interesting hobbies. I’ve noticed that despite your advanced age, you’re here at the school harassing my younger sister?” Guan Yu said irritably.

**Chapter 2911: Shamelessness**

“Guan Yu, you’re mistaken. I’ve taken a liking to Qu Shuangshuang—does that concern you? I believe my sincerity will surely move her,” Bill Lin declared brazenly.

“Nonsense! Shuangshuang is my sister. How could this *not* concern me? Move her? With what?”

“I’m certain Shuangshuang will feel my sincerity.” Bill Lin spoke with grandiose confidence, as if he’d resolved to persist until Shuangshuang accepted him.

“You’d better leave now. Rumor says your family hides three treasure maps. With such a small entourage, aren’t you afraid of being robbed?” Guan Yu threatened.

Bill Lin’s gaze drifted covetously toward Xue Jing beside Guan Yu. Though she wore a mask, he couldn’t resist stealing glances.

“Shuangshuang hasn’t rejected me yet. What right do you have to order me away?”

“The right of being her brother. She can be with anyone—except *you*. Got it?” Guan Yu retorted sharply.

It was midday break, and streams of students passed by. Most recognized Guan Yu, the legendary leader of the Yu Gang whose fame originated from this very campus.

Just then, a lively group emerged from the building. Leading them was Shuangshuang, bouncing cheerfully. Spotting Guan Yu from afar, her joy doubled.

A classmate had earlier informed her: *A wealthy suitor waits at the gate with fifty men holding fifty roses. Other girls are green with envy!*

Qu Shuangshuang thrived on drama. Though many secretly admired her, none dared openly pursue her due to the Yu Gang’s influence. To those covert admirers, she’d gently declined, quietly confessing her heart already belonged to a “Prince Charming.”

That prince, of course, was Guan Yu. Approaching the gate, she chirped, “Big Brother, you’re here!”

Guan Yu waved. Shuangshuang scampered over like a kitten, allowing him to sling an arm around her shoulders. “This shameless old man brought a crowd to woo you. What should we do?”

Blushing under his public embrace, Shuangshuang smiled sweetly. “They can leave the flowers—I’ll pretend *you* bought them. Then they can all scram. Hehe!”

This was Bill Lin’s first close encounter with Shuangshuang. Stunned by her doll-like beauty, he stammered, “Sh-Shuangshuang, my feelings are genuine. Please give me a chance.” He reverently laid his roses at her feet.

Shuangshuang’s heart fluttered—if only Guan Yu were the one holding these flowers! She’d long yearned for that day, uncertain when it might come.

Guan Yu remained silent, letting her handle the situation.

Shuangshuang ignored the offering. “Are you blind? My Big Brother is right here! Bold of you to approach me. Leave before he loses his patience.”

Pointing mockingly, she added, “Look at your idiotic face! Stop embarrassing yourself. Go!”

Bill Lin gaped, never having been so brusquely dismissed. “Shuangshuang, I truly adore you. Won’t you let me prove myself?”

“No.” Her refusal was instant.

The surrounding crowd buzzed. Bill Lin, accustomed to women flocking to him, reeled from this humiliation. He’d envisioned a romantic scene after days of preparation, only to be brutally rejected.

Convinced his wealth and looks would win her, he’d ordered a thousand roses to seal his triumph. Instead, his hopes cratered.

“Hear that?” Guan Yu tightened his grip on Shuangshuang. “Aging men shouldn’t mimic youths. Aren’t you ashamed?”

Ignoring Guan Yu, Bill Lin pressed on. Though he’d anticipated interference, today’s plan blended charm and coercion. “Shuangshuang, what must I change? I’ll do anything—even plastic surgery! The Bill family’s wealth can make it happen!”

Xue Jing almost pitied him—until noticing his lecherous glances.

Shuangshuang smirked. “Really? Then reshape yourself into my Big Brother’s image. Then I’ll consider it.”

Bill Lin froze. Becoming his rival’s double? Unthinkable! Yet he forced a smile. “Any other form? Anything but *him*.”

Shuangshuang’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “How about a horse? I’d glance at you then. Hehe!”

The crowd erupted in laughter. Guan Yu chuckled, “Brilliant! A beastly form suits you.”

Bill Lin’s face purpled with rage. “Enough! Guan Yu, don’t push me!” His fifty henchmen encircled them—clearly elite fighters from the Poison Widow faction.

Guan Yu masked his concern. Though Xue Jing could handle herself, protecting two civilians against these numbers was risky. Yet he smirked, “Think this rabble can take me?”

“This was supposed to be romantic!” Bill Lin spat. “But you’ve ruined it. Let’s settle this by force!”

Shuangshuang taunted, “Cornered dog jumping the wall? Your pack’s too small!” Secretly, Guan Yu calculated: if they held out until Yu Gang reinforcements arrived...

“You’ve opposed me at every turn!” Bill Lin roared. “Even in love? This is Kaihuang Academy’s gate—you’d dare attack here?”

Guan Yu gestured at the surrounding thugs. “Fifty fighters to declare ‘sincerity’? Leave now, or I’ll end you sooner than planned.”

Bill Lin paled. Guan Yu’s reputation for ruthless follow-through haunted him. What if today’s gamble backfired?

**Chapter 2912: The Bite Back**

“I’m not here to fight!” Bill Lin backtracked. “I only wished to court Shuangshuang fairly!”

“With an army?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Hear this clearly: approach her again, and I’ll destroy you. I’ve stayed my hand not from fear, but patience. Test me.”

Bill Lin trembled. Guan Yu’s arrogance was legendary—but so were his victories. Even with Poison Widow elites, doubt gnawed at him.

Shuangshuang clung to Guan Yu, savoring his protective stance. To her, no one compared—this foreign clown least of all.

As tensions peaked, distant shouts echoed. Yu Gang members poured from campus buildings. Bill Lin’s resolve crumbled. With a frustrated snarl, he signaled retreat, his grand romantic farce ending in humiliated defeat.
