“These men are not disciples of his Shilie Sect. No matter how many perish, he naturally wouldn’t feel distressed. Thus, no one cared about the deaths of these cannon fodder at the front.

As Guan Yu slaughtered, the sky suddenly brightened, capturing everyone’s attention. The pitch-black night turned to daylight in an instant. After two breaths, the heavens flushed crimson. Then, above the ranks of elite soldiers, numerous fiery orbs descended from the sky.

“Bad!” Guan Yu cried out in alarm. This was clearly the enemy’s unleashed spell—a fireball incantation targeting the elite troops. If those blazing spheres struck, even survivors would be grievously wounded. Worse, if the flames weren’t swiftly extinguished, they’d spread rapidly.

“Disrupt the spell! Hurry!” Guan Yu roared. Fortunately, the fireball spell’s range was limited, though some soldiers below already danced wildly, ablaze.

His voice thundered, and Wang Xiaorong, whose expertise lay in water-based spells, had already begun acting upon seeing the fiery assault. Hearing Guan Yu’s command, she chanted without hesitation. A dark cloud materialized above the elite soldiers, unleashing a torrential downpour.

Soon, the drenched flames smoldered into smoke. The men found relief as the rain cooled scalded flesh and dulled their pain.

Had Wang Xiaorong delayed, the spreading inferno would have crippled their forces. Flames clinging to bodies would’ve spelled disaster.

Guan Yu scanned the Shilie Sect’s ranks. The instant spellcaster—a master among them—had demonstrated formidable power through that near-instantaneous casting.

Moreover, the caster hadn’t uttered a single incantation. Such skill was no trivial matter. A few more spells like this would overwhelm the elite troops.

The fiery meteor spell had been unleashed by a Shilie elder, intending to deliver a crushing blow. Confident in his fire magic, the elder had believed this spell would secure victory with ease.

Stored in his magical artifact for years, the spell’s deployment pained him, yet desperation left no choice. Notably, the caster had deliberately avoided Guan Yu’s position, wary of the warrior’s countermeasures.

Targeting the rear ranks instead, the elder’s pride turned to frustration when his flames were quenched by sudden rain before achieving anything.

**Chapter 4281: Combined Casting**

The elder glared bitterly at the sky. His meticulously prepared spell had been wasted without effect—snuffed out like a candle.

Misfortune indeed! Fire spells typically overpowered others, yet today they’d encountered a water mage. Elemental countering rendered his efforts futile. Any further spells would meet swift neutralization.

Yu Shu first arranged evacuation of severely wounded fighters to prevent further harm. Meanwhile, the Shilie elder seethed. His treasured spell had failed, and his forces were being steadily pushed back. Time pressed urgently.

Spotting Prince Zou’s carriage from an elevated position, the elder shouted, “All units focus! Combine forces for Meteor Spell—target the carriage in their ranks!”

Disciples produced varied magical implements—some decent, others crude, a few empty-handed. The Meteor Spell required collective willpower and spiritual energy—a devastating group incantation. The elder staked everything on this strike.

Guan Yu noticed twenty-some cultivators channeling energy, turbulent currents swirling above them. They needed disrupting immediately. However, knowing the carriage was empty, he prioritized family safety but still yelled, “Shield the carriage! Protect its occupant at all costs!”

Time was critical. Wang Xiaorong acted without concealing her identity. Raising her Butterfly Pouch, she chanted. A massive azure tortoise-shell dome enveloped the carriage—a defensive barrier stronger than usual, empowered by the artifact’s energy.

The narrow road swarmed with relentless attackers. Guan Yu disabled foes without killing, though trampling claimed several lives. Attempting to leap skyward proved impossible amidst the press.

As the meteor formation coalesced, Guan Yu noted Wang Xiaorong’s shield over the carriage but doubted its resilience. Still, since Prince Zou wasn’t inside, priority remained on routing the enemy.

The elite troops fought valiantly under Guan Yu’s lead. Wang Jun observed from the rear, spotting a crescent-blade wielder cutting through ranks with lethal grace—severing limbs and heads.

Wang Jun leveled his crossbow. Amidst battle clamor, the bolt flew silently. The killer sensed danger, parrying at the last moment with a metallic clang! The impact staggered him.

Eyes blazing, the man roared, “So you’re the sniper! I’ll end you first!” charging toward Wang Jun.

The cultured phrasing from this blood-soaked warrior puzzled Wang Jun. Retreat proved impossible as allies pressed forward. Guan Yu kicked aside an opponent, drawing his pistol.

Suddenly, daylight erupted above the carriage—a blazing sun-like radiance. Combatants froze, gaping at the spectacle. A crimson vortex formed—an inverted volcanic maw hanging ominously.

Guan Yu bellowed, “Everyone retreat!” realizing the Meteor Spell’s expanded radius. Too late. Football-sized fireballs rained down, scorching air and earth alike.

The carriage vicinity—manned by Hongren’s brothers—became hellfire. Men writhed, ablaze. Hongren watched in anguished futility as comrades burned.

Wang Xiaorong’s shield dimmed under fiery onslaught, then shattered. Flames engulfed the carriage. Panicked horses, themselves burning, stampeded through friendly ranks—trampling thirty soldiers.

“Extinguish the flames!” Yu Shu ordered. Men threw sand on smoldering comrades. As the fiery hail ceased, Wang Xiaorong summoned a thunderstorm—a desperate bid to douse remaining fires.

Prince Zou, witnessing this hellscape from safety, shuddered. Had he remained in the carriage, nothing would remain. “Can we retreat beyond their spell range?” he asked Zou Wuhui.

“We mustn’t move,” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “They’ll suspect deception if we withdraw. Instead, advance! Mourn ostentatiously—make them believe you perished. They may then withdraw.”

**Chapter 4282: Remorse**

None objected. Feigning grief might deceive the enemy. As Yu Shu tended wounded, the Shilie forces seemed hesitant to press further.
