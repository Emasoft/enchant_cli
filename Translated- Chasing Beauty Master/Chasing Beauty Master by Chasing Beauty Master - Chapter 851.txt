“Ah, little sister, the surveillance footage shows no sign of Guanyu leaving. I’m certain he’s still within the Feng residence. The other three buildings have been thoroughly searched. Only the west tower remains—he’s most likely hiding there.” Young Master Feng patted the shoulder of the bodyguard beside him, signaling to be set down.

He continued, “You must understand my concern. If Guanyu is hiding in the west tower and the guards withdraw, you’ll be in grave danger. Guanyu is the Feng family’s sworn enemy. I can’t rest until he’s captured.”

Feng Xihu (West Lake) pondered his words, her heart stirring with conflicting emotions. Part of her wished Guanyu truly were hidden here—it would mean seeing him again, sharing more time together…

“Very well, you may search,” she relented, her voice softening. “But no one enters my room.” The bodyguards exhaled in collective relief.

As Feng Xihu turned toward her chambers, Young Master Feng hurried to intercept her. “Wait! He could be in your room! It’s dangerous to go alone!”

“I’ll search my own quarters. This doesn’t concern you.” She strode past him, ignoring Bi Erlin’s hopeful gaze. The man had hoped to impress her, but she didn’t so much as glance his way.

Behind the door, Guanyu tensed at the approaching footsteps. Would she scream upon discovering him? Betray him? He steadied his breathing, poised to subdue her if necessary.

The west tower’s staircase, normally muffled by French wool carpets requiring barefoot ascent, now echoed with deliberate stomps. Feng Xihu’s lotus-patterned heels struck each step sharply, creating intentional noise. Her mind raced: surveillance showed no exit. Every corner of the Feng estate was monitored—Guanyu couldn’t have escaped undetected unless invisible. If not in the other buildings…

Her room offered no hiding spots—a stark rectangle without partitions. Guanyu pressed against the door, breath held.

“Big Brother,” she called loudly from the threshold, “everything seems fine here. Withdraw your men. I wish to rest.” The raised voice served dual purposes: reassuring Guanyu and dispersing the search party.

When she entered, she didn’t turn to face him. “Aren’t you afraid I’ll harm you?” Guanyu asked from behind the door.

Feng Xihu stretched languidly, ignoring his question. She slipped off her shoes and slid beneath the covers, back turned.

“I need to… relieve myself,” Guanyu awkwardly confessed. “Could you…?”

She pulled the blanket over her head. Outside, guards shuffled below.

The muffled sounds that followed made her cheeks burn. Guanyu, equally embarrassed, had sat to minimize noise. Afterward, he checked the door—four guards remained posted downstairs.

“No trace of him,” a guard reported to Young Master Feng.

“Withdraw,” came the frustrated order. “But leave four at the entrance. Protect my sister.”

In the monitoring room hours later, Young Master Feng rubbed tired eyes. “Bi Erlin, where could he be?”

“You still believe he’s here?” Bi Erlin yawned. “We’ve turned this place inside out.”

“My instincts say yes. Her room…”

A phone rang in Feng Xihu’s chamber. She answered tersely: “What now, Big Brother?”

“Just checking if you’re hungry. Should I send up some congee?”

“Don’t disturb me.” She hung up.

Alone again, the room’s floral scent intensified. Guanyu sat cross-legged on the carpet as Feng Xihu slept fitfully. When she awoke hours later, she found him at her computer—desktop wallpaper displaying his photo, folders brimming with documented encounters and unrequited confessions.

“How dare you!” She yanked him from the chair, tears welling. Files scrolled—dates, memories, yearning words.

Guanyu’s throat tightened. This proud heiress, envied by all, had hidden depths of loneliness. When she collapsed sobbing into his arms, he could only pat her back awkwardly.

“Listen carefully,” she whispered later, composure regained. “I’ll get you out.”

As she exited to confront the guards, Young Master Feng replayed surveillance footage frame by frame, oblivious to the truth under his nose.

In her room, Guanyu studied the French carpet’s imprinted shoe marks—the very clues that betrayed his presence. Outside, four loyal guards stood watch, never suspecting their lady’s heart had become the ultimate safehouse.
