“Will you two stop messing around?” Guan Yu said helplessly. “Even if my tastes changed drastically, I’d never go for something like that. At worst, I still have the women in Qiao Garden.”

Jones had been joking all along. As Guan Yu tried to explain, she added mischievously, “I thought you’d grown tired of those women in Qiao Garden and wanted a change of flavor, so you picked someone like this. Hehehe.”

Jones’ remarks were particularly unbearable to Xue Jing, who shuddered and broke out in goosebumps. Brushing her arms, she deliberately shot Guan Yu a sidelong glance before edging away, as though he carried some filthy contamination.

Guan Yu blinked, observing Xue Jing’s exaggerated reaction. “What’s that look for? Do you actually think that way about me? Seriously?”

“I didn’t before,” Xue Jing retorted, “but after hearing Jones’ reasoning, it makes sense. Are you… unclean? Stay back! Keep your distance!” She recoiled further as Guan Yu took a step toward her.

Seizing the opportunity, Jones pressed, “Did I actually hit the mark? Has Guan Yu’s taste really shifted?”

Dodging Guan Yu’s advances, Xue Jing mused, “It does seem plausible. Only now do I realize there were many solutions to this problem, yet he chose the most convoluted one. Though it appeared gentle, perhaps he truly has his eye on Jiu Biyun.”

**Chapter 2835: Overwhelmed**

Guan Yu broke into a sprint, chasing Xue Jing. “Don’t you dare run! Just wait till I catch you—you’ll regret this!”

Xue Jing easily outpaced him, shamelessly channeling her inner energy to flee faster. Guan Yu stood no chance.

Soon gasping for breath, Guan Yu wheezed, “You little brat! Keep running and see if I take you back tonight! Get over here now, or I’m leaving without you!”

Xue Jing shot Jones a pleading look. Naturally, Jones sided with her. “It’s late. Why don’t you both stay here? My place is spacious enough.”

“Yes! Let’s do that!” Xue Jing clapped. “Jones, I’ll share your room!”

Guan Yu objected, “No. We have matters at home, and nights are unsettled lately. I’ll sleep better there. Let’s go, Jingjing.” He turned to leave but found Jones blocking his path in a blur of movement.

“I said you’re staying,” Jones declared. “Why insist on leaving?”

“You—” Guan Yu faltered, momentarily stunned by her audacity. A spark of irritation flared. “Move. When I say we’re leaving, we leave.”

Xue Jing froze at Guan Yu’s stern tone, but Jones stood her ground. “Make me. You can’t beat me anyway.”

“Rebellious, are we?” Guan Yu growled. “Need a reminder of who’s in charge?”

“Try it,” Jones taunted. “Knock me down, and you’re free to go.”

“Fine! Since you’ve forgotten your place—” In one fluid motion, Guan Yu hoisted Jones over his shoulder, then snagged Xue Jing with a twist of his arm. Marching toward the bedroom, he announced, “You’ll both learn exactly how ‘unclean’ my tastes have become!”

Fortunately, Jones’ soundproof room spared others from the night’s commotion...

**Chapter 2836: Refreshed**

At dawn, Xue Jing awoke stiffly, her legs trembling from overexertion. Despite this, she rose to prepare breakfast—a daily ritual she shared with Amei to prevent Qiao Garden’s residents from starving.

Blinking groggily, she realized her surroundings—last night’s escapades rushed back. Though aching, she couldn’t shirk her duties. Her movements roused Jones.

“Why up so early?” Jones groaned. “It’s six! Another hour won’t hurt…”

Xue Jing whispered, “We must make breakfast. Help me navigate here.”

Jones yawned, “Meals arrive at seven. Sleep more.” Remembering Jones’ staff, Xue Jing sighed. Her scattered clothes posed another issue—several undergarments lay torn. Glaring at the slumbering Guan Yu, she dressed in his beige shirt, resolving to leave him shirtless as payback.

After freshening up, Xue Jing sought Jiu Biyun’s room. Few in the Freedom Organization knew her whereabouts until Jiang Fenju appeared.

“She’s in a guest room,” he said. “The doctor just administered an IV. I’ll escort you.”

Entering, Xue Jing found Jiu Biyun pale and hollow-eyed. “How are you? Do you need anything?”

“When can I contact Yuan Shanding?” Jiu Biyun rasped. “Bill Lin must’ve abandoned him by now.”

“Not yet,” Xue Jing replied. “Bill Lin insists Yuan stay at the Fengs’. We’ll pressure him today—if he remains, we’ll threaten your safety.”

As silence fell, Xue Jing departed after instructing Jiang Fenju: “Keep her alive. Fulfill reasonable requests.”

Guan Yu awoke rejuvenated, as if shedding ten pounds overnight. After breakfast, he and Xue Jing left to investigate the Fengs’ situation. Having lost Jiu Biyun, Feng’s household must be frantic.

Back at Qiao Garden, Guan Yu sent Yuan Shanding photos of Jiu Biyun taken that morning, then called. “See? She’s safe. But why are you still at the Fengs’? Testing my patience?”

Yuan protested, “Bill Lin asked me to stay! I’ve broken no terms!”

“Fool!” Guan Yu snapped. “Bill Lin wants her dead to turn you against me. I moved her first. Check where Poison Widow and Luo Bo vanished—they tried killing her last night!”

Confronted, Bill Lin feigned innocence. “I’d never harm her! They’re helping rescue her!”

Skeptical, Yuan Shanding demanded proof. Bill Lin led him to a room, whispering, “They’re at Yang’s clinic with Feng—rescuing her!”

**Chapter 2837: Radio Silence**

“Rescuing?” Yuan frowned.

“Would Feng accompany a hit squad?” Bill Lin countered. “Use your head!”

But Yuan stood firm. “Guan Yu threatens to kill her if I stay. I leave today.”

“One more day!” Bill Lin pleaded. “They might succeed!”

“No. I won’t gamble her life.” Yuan turned, deaf to Bill Lin’s curses against Guan Yu.

Watching him go, Bill Lin seethed. Without Yuan’s forces, his plans crumbled. Yet the truth remained buried—Poison Widow and Luo Bo had indeed failed, their fates unknown.
