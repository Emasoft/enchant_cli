“A man as fickle-hearted as him showing such unwavering devotion to one woman is an exceedingly rare occurrence.”

“Truth be told,” Ling Su said with an aggrieved expression, feigning pitifulness, “I’m being pursued by assassins and fled into the desert. After days without food or a single drop of water, I came here seeking help. If I leave now, my enemies will surely catch and kill me. I know outsiders aren’t welcome here, so I won’t impose further.”

Ling Su wondered if this tale would convince them to let him stay. He desperately needed to remain, knowing Guanyu’s group would arrive today. Once they came, they’d likely rest nearby. If he stayed hidden, he could sabotage them from the shadows, making those bastards rue their carelessness.

Mazhagen studied Ling Su’s appearance. Though the clan leader was absent, the silver offered proved too tempting. “Our clan shuns outsiders,” he said, glancing at Xiaomei, “but since your life’s at stake, I’ll let you rest here one day. Tomorrow at dawn, you’ll leave with provisions.”

“This mercy is bought by your silver,” Mazhagen added sternly. “Were the clan leader present, you’d be turned away.”

Ling Su’s face brightened. “My deepest gratitude! Might I trouble you for food now? My stomach’s been empty for days.” He bowed slightly, maintaining his charade.

Xiaomei remained silent. Though distrustful, she deferred to Mazhagen’s decision.

After exchanging names, Mazhagen instructed, “I’ll take you to shelter, but first you must change clothes to blend in.” Pocketing the silver pouch, he marveled at its weight – more wealth than he’d seen in years.

This suited Ling Su perfectly. New garments would make him harder for Guanyu’s men to recognize. “Brother Mazhagen,” he pressed, “my pursuers may arrive soon. Should anyone come, you mustn’t reveal my presence.”

“Worry not,” Mazhagen assured. “Though the clan leader’s away, sentries guard our borders. No outsiders enter. I swear this as the clan leader’s son.”

The plan unfolded perfectly. Though spent of silver, Ling Su contemplated retrieving it later. His priority remained ambushing Guanyu’s group first.

“Xiaomei, fetch him my spare clothes,” Mazhagen ordered. The ill-fitting garments hung comically on Ling Su’s smaller frame, but served their purpose. As they departed, Ling Su shot a covetous glance at Xiaomei, inwardly cursing: “What waste – fresh cabbage devoured by swine! When will Fortune grant me such beauty?”

The desert winds had eased since nightfall. Clad in Mazhagen’s thick fur-lined coat, Ling Su felt revived after drinking deeply earlier. He followed warily, suspecting treachery. The settlement appeared deserted, residents sheltering from harsh elements.

Approaching a massive black cube-shaped structure, Ling Su gasped. “What is this place? Building such in the desert must’ve been arduous!”

“Our clan hall and gathering place,” Mazhagen explained proudly. “Two years our people labored, hauling materials across deserts. Your sanctuary lies within.”

Guards admitted them through towering doors. Inside, a wellspring buzzed with activity as Ha clansmen in colorful attire queued for water. “This artesian well sustains us,” Mazhagen said. “Its sweet waters first drew us here when fleeing persecution.”

Ling Su recalled the faintly sweet water Xiaomei had given him. “Remarkable! You dug this yourselves?”

“It predates us,” Mazhagen replied. “We discovered it while escaping those who called us ill-omened. Once numbering thousands, plague decimated us. Now mere hundreds remain, hiding here to rebuild.”

Ling Su feigned sympathy while inwardly scoffing: “Fools! With such weakling attitudes, extinction beckons.”

Mazhagen continued, “Our leader says we’ll return triumphant to Central Plains someday.” He gestured at orchards beyond the hall where leafless trees bore thick-skinned green fruits. “These ‘human fruits’ and livestock sustain us. Try one.”

Peeling the verdant rind revealed golden flesh. Ling Su bit into the juicy sweetness. “Delicious! Tastes like ambrosia.”

“We cultivate these groves and preserve meats,” Mazhagen added. “Though grains won’t grow, we trade for supplies. Now rest – you’ll need strength for tomorrow’s journey.”

As they ascended spiral stairs, Ling Su eyed the strange bounty. Survival here defied desert logic, yet these stubborn people persisted. His mind raced with schemes – against Guanyu’s men, against these naive hosts, against the cruel fate that left him silverless and lusting. The game was afoot.
