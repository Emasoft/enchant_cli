Since emerging from Kunlun, Guan Yu's reputation in the cultivation world had far exceeded even his own expectations. Two Great Ascension realm cultivators now inspired awe across both orthodox and demonic factions, with even reclusive sects beginning to stir – some extending invitations, others viewing him with hostility or guarded observation.

These reactions stemmed not from his status as Wild Crane Daoist's disciple, but rather his position as Sect Master of the Demon Subduing Sect. Truth be told, Guan Yu had effectively become a sect apostate.

Only Guan Yu himself understood the true weight he carried. With Vajra Guardian no longer able to support him openly, self-strengthening became imperative. As Vajra had declared at Kunlun Square that day: "This world ultimately bows to the strongest fist." Guan Yu resolved to forge himself into that ultimate fist.

The Demon Subduing Sect's legacy brought both glory and formidable backing, but more profoundly, responsibility. Recent months saw Guan Yu not only cultivating divine abilities but restructuring sect regulations and establishing new disciple recruitment criteria.

Rebuilding a near-extinct sect proved labyrinthine. As Guan Yu navigated this process, he prepared for an overseas voyage. Lingering thorns demanded extraction – though Nascent Soul initial stage cultivation restricted worldly travels, the mental discomfort of unresolved matters proved intolerable. Three days later, as Penglai Island came into view over the Eastern Sea, Guan Yu's lips quirked upward. Another bout of unbridled action awaited. How he missed simpler days of low-profile existence... yet this path held its own appeal.

**Chapter 2002: In Pursuit of Penglai**

"Sect Master, are you considering resolving the lingering threats directly at Penglai?" Qin Wuliang observed Guan Yu with approval. The young leader's recent preoccupation with Ye Qingling and apparent neglect of sect affairs had raised concerns, but this decisive move revealed strategic foresight. "These matters shouldn't be rushed."

"Precisely. I require Elder Qin's assistance. Your previous counsel about establishing roots in the Central Plains holds merit, but available territories are already claimed. The recent conflict with Outer Domain Three Sects revealed intense xenophobia. With our fresh enmity toward Kunlun, establishing a mountain gate should wait." Guan Yu engaged in his first serious discussion about sect foundation with the elder.

Recent months served dual purposes – atoning for past neglect of Ye Qingling while decompressing from over a decade of arduous cultivation. Through travels and leisure, Guan Yu's mental state gradually refined. Balance between tension and relaxation remained essential, even for cultivators.

"Your reasoning is sound, Sect Master. But where exactly is this Penglai Island? Ancient records mention Penglai Paradise as Antarctic Immortal's domain, unlikely matching modern geography." Qin Wuliang's sharp intellect showed why Vajra had prioritized his resurrection.

In antiquity, immortals roamed freely while Great Ascension cultivators were mere foot soldiers. Only thirty-six primordial experts survived within the Demon Subduing Sect's protective arrays, preserving their spiritual consciousness through millennia until suitable vessels like Qin's current body became available.

Though sparse spiritual energy prolonged soul-body integration, survival itself remained miraculous. "No matter. Penglai will find us if we don't seek it. Elder Qin, how fares your fusion? When will full control manifest?" Guan Yu smiled serenely. Previously constrained by weakness, he now held strategic advantages beyond Wild Crane Daoist's support.

"Full control? Sect Master jests. After millennia of soul erosion, I can barely manifest early Great Ascension power. Mastering this Great Ascension physique requires three centuries at minimum – with favorable conditions." Qin's timeframe left Guan Yu speechless.

"No matter. Are we being tracked? Those formations you deployed en route weren't merely decorative." Decision made, Guan Yu would deploy his hidden cards strategically when required.

"Of course. Here are surveillance images. But Sect Master... how did you detect my movements? I took utmost care." Qin's confidence wavered, unnerved by Guan Yu's unexpected awareness.

"A minor trick. Survival demands certain safeguards. My thanks, Elder Qin. By nightfall, Penglai's location will be ours." Guan Yu's enigmatic smile discouraged further inquiry – some mysteries best retained.

**Chapter 2003: Storming the Gates**

"Leopard? Yes. I need full profiles on these individuals before tonight." Guan Yu's rapid phone conversation in his seaside villa revealed complete recovery – physical and mental prime restored for impending conflicts.

After meticulous planning with Qin Wuliang, Guan Yu rested knowing challenges ahead involved not just cultivation world clashes but mortal intrigues.

"Guan Yu, Kyoto's fax arrived. Dragon Group's Ninghai branch representatives await. Will you receive them?" Lin Dong, gradually evolving into Guan Yu's mortal-world steward, presented documents.

"Indeed. How did Long Aotian handle my Dragon Group status?" Guan Yu checked his watch – 6:07 PM. The organization's efficiency impressed even him.

"Special Assistant position granted, equivalent to Vice-Commander with jurisdiction over East China. Regional authorities notified." Lin Dong marveled at Guan Yu's seamless orchestration.

Descending to meet five male and female agents exuding arrogance typical of Dragon Group operatives, Guan Yu's glacial gaze instantly subdued their pretensions. These local toughs involuntarily bowed under psychic pressure, their defiance crumbling before unseen dominance.

"Elites should understand your temporary subordination. Personal compensation awaits post-mission. Complete these tasks and await me at Tianfu Tower." Guan Yu's blunt approach suited these worldly players.

**Chapter 2004: Eliminating Threats**

"Tianfu Group monopolizing coastal shipping in thirty years? The Cheng family's talent pool lacks cultivators?" Guan Yu reconfirmed intel with Ninghai branch chief Xiao Xiao – a stunning young aristocrat – en route to headquarters.

"Dragon Group's detection methods never fail. But Guan Yu... what reward might this 'Special Assistant' offer?" Xiao Xiao's playful tone masked shrewd calculation.

"You'll see. Ensure local authorities stay clear – I merely make a statement." Guan Yu's smile chilled as they entered the brightly-lit Tianfu Tower at 8 PM.

Chaos ensued as plainclothes officers secured the lobby. A charging security guard froze mid-lunge at Guan Yu's psychic command, dragged away without resistance.

"What did you tell him?" Xiao Xiao whispered in the elevator.

"Cease movement or perish." Guan Yu noted guards' Foundation Establishment cultivation – clear evidence of Penglai's mortal-world tendrils.

The conference room door exploded inward. Guan Yu's demeanor shifted from icy authority to genial menace, unsettling even Xiao Xiao.

"Who dares—" A young man's shout died as Guan Yu's psychic aura engulfed the room.

"Chairman Cheng recognizes me, surely?" Guan Yu's smile radiated arctic malice.

"Guan Yu... to what do we owe this... honor?" Cheng Tianfu maintained composure despite cold sweat.

"Honor? Ask your security chief why he tracked me for Penglai! Does your family wish annihilation?" Guan Yu's laugh echoed as he flicked fingers, sending the chief crashing into walls – a crumpled heap with Late Core Formation cultivation.

"Evidence, Guan Yu! This is—" Cheng YuanYang's protest died before Dragon Group credentials.

"Call your connections. I could dismantle Tianfu within hours." Guan Yu's casual tone drained color from Cheng faces. This wasn't battle – it was checkmate before first move.

"Name your terms." Cheng Tianfu capitulated, glancing at his son.

"Service. Talent deserves utilization." Guan Yu's smile returned. Securing Cheng's maritime assets served dual purposes – severing Penglai's influence while expanding his own.

**Chapter 2005: Severing Roots**

Subsequent negotiations proceeded smoothly through intermediaries. Within days, Guan Yu studied nautical charts to a modest island bearing Penglai's hallowed name.

"Insulting the ancient blessed land's legacy." Qin Wuliang sneered as Guan Yu activated a jade token against coastal rocks, teleporting into the sect.

"Demon Subduing Sect Master Guan Yu and Elder Qin Wuliang pay respects!" Guan Yu's thunderous proclamation shook the island.

"A Kunlun-defying whelp dares—" A azure-garbed giant materialized, bestial aura rippling.

"Shape-shifting demon? How dare this offshore den shelter monsters!" Qin intercepted the creature's pressure, Dragon-Tiger Scepter clashing against twin hammers.

"Human treachery!" the demon roared.

"Your corpse shall guard our mountain." Qin's counterattack intensified as Guan Yu observed calmly – this beast posed no true threat. The true battle for Penglai's secrets had just begun.
