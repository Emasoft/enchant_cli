Guan Yu gently stroked Zhao Jing'er's silken hair and said, "Brother still has some matters to attend to. Stay home and keep Grandpa company, Jingjing. I'll come get you immediately after finishing my business, okay?"

He understood the reason for Zhao Jing'er's low spirits, and could only coax her with comforting words. The lingering guilt from accidentally seeing her naked earlier still weighed heavily on his conscience.

"Not too long. Maybe four or five days out." Guan Yu answered uncertainly.

"Be careful out there," Zhao Jing'er whispered softly.

"Mhm." Guan Yu nodded gently.

Zhao Zilong felt a sense of defeat. Despite being Zhao Jing'er's biological grandfather, he'd been completely overlooked - this favoritism towards outsiders was simply too blatant. Yet considering it differently, he felt pleased. At least Zhao Jing'er had found emotional support, no longer the pitiful girl who might be taken by heaven at any moment.

He smiled at Guan Yu: "Tian Xun's five men will secretly protect you at all times. Lin Dong can't touch you. Focus on safety first before considering how to apprehend Lin Dong."

Guan Yu shot Zhao Zilong a grateful glance.

The breakfast concluded on cheerful notes. Guan Yu couldn't help but admire Zhao Zilong's efficiency. Before he'd even finished his post-meal cigarette, all requested items appeared on the table, including a military-grade phone. As Zhao Zilong put it, "One can hardly manage affairs outside without a phone."

Without ceremony, Guan Yu took the phone and left Zhongnanhai alone. Naturally, he wasn't foolish enough to exit through the main gates conspicuously, choosing instead a discreet route. Being immediately spotted by Lin Dong would be... kidney-and-liver-achingly troublesome.

Reaching downtown Beijing after putting distance from Zhongnanhai, Guan Yu dialed Li Yuanshan's number. Surprisingly, a woman answered - she'd be arranging all his行程in the capital. Guan Yu lit a cigarette indifferently as he waited.

He was about to meet a beauty - one that would utterly surprise him.

Chapter 424: The Goddess

Northern winters bite with particularly bitter cold.

After waiting several street-side minutes with no arrival, Guan Yu settled into a nearby café. Ordering a cappuccino, he idly fiddled with his new phone. Having grown up with limited exposure to technology, even ordinary phones perplexed him - this military-grade device left him completely baffled. Losing interest after minutes, he began surveying nearby beauties.

Though Beijing women maintained decent standards, none met Guan Yu's exacting criteria. His eyes had been spoiled by the stunners at home; what others considered beauties barely registered as passable. When faces disappointed, he turned to figures - but damn this winter, burying curves beneath layers!

After thirty unremarkable minutes, just as he withdrew his gaze, movement at the café entrance arrested him. An exquisite oval face with newborn-baby soft skin. Glossy vermilion lips. Eyebrows painted by poets. Eyes holding liquid light. Winter couldn't conceal her golden-ratio perfection. Yet this supreme beauty exuded icy detachment - the very incarnation of an unapproachable goddess.

Her entrance dimmed the entire café. Time froze as all eyes locked onto her, patrons forgetting their original purposes. Guan Yu clicked his tongue in admiration, equally captivated. "Such beauty belongs in heaven, not earth," he mused, mentally comparing her to his housemates - different flowers, incomparable.

After appreciating his fill, Guan Yu resumed sipping coffee. Gorgeous as she was, she sparked no interest - his domestic challenges remained unresolved. Even goddesses would have to wait.

Several well-born dandies immediately ditched their girlfriends, preparing to approach. But their jaws dropped when the goddess headed straight towards a shabby youth in worn sneakers and cheap tracksuit - the kind they'd assume was construction labor if not for his café seat.

All wondered: How could a goddess favor this pauper? That they knew each other? Impossible! Worse, the scruffy lad kept drinking coffee, oblivious to her approach! Maybe she's just passing by, they desperately hoped.

Their hopes shattered as she sat opposite him. Eyeballs practically rolled across the floor. Was this modern goddesses' taste? Shunning handsome elites for construction-worker-turned-poseur?

Only when seated did Guan Yu look up, mild surprise flashing then fading. "Do we know each other?"

The goddess regarded him coolly: "Not yet. But we will. Won't you offer me coffee?"

Guan Yu squinted, grinning: "Order your own. I've only enough for mine."

Hostility radiated from every male present. These beasts cursed his wastefulness - a coffee's petty cost versus an exquisite beauty's company! Even mere conversation would be priceless!

This confirmed their "construction worker" theory. One dandy strode over gallantly: "Miss, might I have the honor of buying your coffee?"

The goddess didn't even glance his way, maintaining her stare. Guan Yu felt exposed under her gaze, as if she could unveil all secrets. Uncomfortable, he finally set down his cup.

"I'm curious - how'd you find me here?"

Her expression remained placid, though inwardly surprised. Instead of answering, she countered: "Would you wait outside in -20°C for half an hour?"

Guan Yu shrugged: "Then how'd you pinpoint this location?"

Indeed, upon her sitting, Guan Yu guessed she must be Li Yuanshan's contact. He envied Li for acquiring such beauty - their relationship unknown.

"Intuition," she stated.

Guan Yu rolled eyes - rather trust ghosts than women's tongues. Yet shock ran through him - this woman wasn't simple. Without Tian Xun's counter-surveillance confirming no tails after leaving Zhongnanhai, he'd suspect her of having him followed. Her deduction skills terrified.

Activating his detection system, Guan Yu investigated. The truth proved laughable - she'd arrived when he entered, observing through the window! More surprising was her identity: Li Yuanshan's daughter, Li Xi.

Chapter 425: Business Opportunity

Discovering Li Xi's surveillance method, Guan Yu shot her a glare, slightly annoyed she'd made him wait. Leaning forward, he asked: "Do you like me?"

"First meeting," Li Xi frowned coolly, though puzzled by his abruptness. Such forwardness lowered her impression.

"Then why watch me thirty minutes?" He grinned, pointing at the window.

Her frosty composure cracked. How had he detected her observation? Was he feigning ignorance earlier? Testing her? But why test when unaware of her identity?

Countless questions flooded her mind. A flicker of panic, quickly suppressed. Since exposed, honesty prevailed: "Merely curious if you matched my father's descriptions."

Guan Yu rubbed his nose: "Conclusions?"

"Thirty minutes. Sixteen women eyed. Three held your gaze over three minutes, others under one. Matches my data - an unrepentant playboy." Her tone stayed flat.

Guan Yu reddened, dignity wounded by public exposure. Her freakish observation skills (even timing each glance!) earned his verdict: This woman had too much free time.

The lingering dandy finally slunk away, realizing his invisibility. Guan Yu hastily changed subject: "There's something I need your help with."

"Speak," she replied casually.

Guan Yu outlined his need: A portable, high-capacity power storage device - compact as a pocketable stun gun but exponentially more powerful, with instant charge/discharge.

Li Xi fell silent. The concept was brilliant. Current markets lacked such products. Successful development promised massive profits. Extending this concept - phones lasting years; replacing bulky industrial power sources... The applications were endless in our electricity-dependent world. Market domination would be swift, profits astronomical.

Li Xi saw beyond Guan Yu's needs, envisioning global commercial conquest. Her business acumen proved razor-sharp. Looking up excitedly: "I've never heard of such products, but we can research them."

She detailed potential applications and profits. Even conservative estimates suggested future world riches. Guan Yu's blood boiled. This could accelerate his power-building exponentially! He admired her vision - while he sought personal solutions, she saw revenue streams. What a gap!

Yet he questioned: "Why tell me this?"

"As originator, you deserve knowledge. But this cake's too big for us. R&D costs are prohibitive. Security would be nightmare. Capital sharks would devour us once word leaks."

Her analysis doused Guan Yu's fervor. Indeed, complexities abounded. Secrecy could involve national cooperation - Zhao Zilong's connections might help. Military/political benefits would ensure state protection. But funding...

"How much for initial research?"

Li Xi pondered: "Still conceptual. Proper assessment needed, but certainly beyond my father's total assets."

Guan Yu's head throbbed. Funding posed huge challenge. Yet such potential couldn't be abandoned.

Chapter 426: Class Reunion

"How long for assessment?" Guan Yu asked.

Li Xi eyed him curiously - his persistence surprised her. "About a week."

"A week..." He repeated. His Beijing stay matched this timeline. "Could your team prepare it? I'll cover salaries. Deliverable in a week?"

She raised eyebrows: "I've said it's impossible currently. Why bother?"

"What about military partnership?"

Li Xi paused, analyzing: "That solves both issues. But securing cooperation's difficult. Worse, they might steal the idea. National interests would supersede individual claims."

Her words chilled Guan Yu. Indeed, the state might appropriate such strategic technology. But he'd already considered this risk.
