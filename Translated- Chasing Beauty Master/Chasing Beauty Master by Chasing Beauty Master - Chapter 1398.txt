“Have you seen Guan Yu? When is he departing tomorrow?” Wang Xiaorong asked urgently. These past few days, she had yearned for Guan Yu day and night, even dreaming of their heart-pounding encounters in the grove during sleep—memories that left her endlessly savoring the moments.

"Reporting to Young Mistress, I did meet Guan Yu. However, a minor complication arose. Xuanming assigned Yan Zhao, the chief disciple of Tigerhead Peak, to accompany him on this mission. Guan Yu stated that to avoid exposing his identity and to secure a stable foothold in the Cloud Azure Sect, having Yan Zhao by his side prevents him from visiting the Demon Lord at the Demon Soul Sect, fearing suspicion," Wang Jun reported.

"Yan Zhao?" Wang Xiaorong paused, pondering deeply. Wasn't Yan Zhao himself a member of the Demon Soul Sect? What was there to fear? Yet she knew Yan Zhao's identity remained shrouded in mystery, unknown to others, so she refrained from further comment.

Moreover, she had promised Guan Yu to never casually disclose their relationship. Now trouble brewed—if Guan Yu didn't visit the Demon Soul Sect, the Demon Lord would refuse to permit Wang Xiaorong's joint mission with him. This posed a grave problem.

After deliberation, Wang Xiaorong declared, “This is the plan: Tomorrow morning, I’ll arrange for Guan Yu to meet me here—their必经之路. Return and inform him that I’ll handle all arrangements. If necessary, we’ll abandon the Demon Soul Sect visit. I’ll request the Demon Lord to emerge and meet Guan Yu elsewhere.”

Wang Jun nodded. “Understood. If there are no further matters, I shall take my leave.”

“Good. Ensure Guan Yu receives this message. Tell him to follow my instructions without deviation—this guarantees success,” Wang Xiaorong commanded.

On his return journey, Wang Jun puzzled over why the Demon Lord insisted on meeting Guan Yu. That the Demon Lord would deign to emerge personally when Guan Yu couldn’t visit the sect seemed excessively accommodating. Had Guan Yu truly...consummated his relationship with the Young Mistress? It appeared the Demon Lord, as a prospective father-in-law, sought to hold his future son-in-law accountable. How would Guan Yu face this patriarch?

At dawn’s first light, Wang Jun arrived at Guan Yu’s door, weary from overnight travels. Guan Yu still slept when Wang Jun raised his hand to knock. Suddenly, a cold blade pressed against his neck—Second Wolf stood behind him, having just returned and finding a suspicious figure lurking outside Guan Yu’s chamber.

“Who are you?” Second Wolf demanded.

Wang Jun dared not turn. “Hero, stay your hand! If you’re here to kill the room’s occupant, I’ve no part in it. I too seek him, though our purposes may differ.”

“Silence!” Second Wolf barked. “Sneaking here at this hour shows familiarity with these premises. How else would you locate this chamber? State your purpose!”

“Hero, blades lack eyes—spare my flawless skin. I bear no ill intent. Please exercise restraint,” Wang Jun pleaded, detecting from the man’s tone that he meant Guan Yu no harm.

Second Wolf remained unconvinced. The stranger’s black attire and travel-worn appearance suggested mischief, though his slight build contradicted a professional assassin’s bearing. Deciding Guan Yu’s presence would clarify matters, Second Wolf kicked the door open with a thunderous crash.

Guan Yu jolted awake from sweet dreams of domestic bliss with Wang Xiaorong. “What’s happening?!” he shouted, leaping from bed.

Recognizing the figures, he roared, “Who dares wreck my door?! Second Brother? You’re back? Wang Jun? What devilry brings you here at dawn?!”

“You’re unharmed—good,” Second Wolf said, sheathing his blade upon realizing Guan Yu knew the visitor. He entered, dropping a large bundle on the table. “Days of relentless travel have exhausted me.”

Wang Jun eyed Second Wolf warily, unnerved by how silently the man had approached. Had he meant harm, Wang Jun’s head would already lie severed. Clearly, this was the rumored expert guarding Guan Yu.

“Guan Yu, what friends keep you? This one nearly took my life!” Wang Jun complained, eyeing the shattered door—its lock broken by a single kick.

“Pay him no mind—he’s ever vigilant,” Guan Yu sighed, ushering Wang Jun inside. “You’ve met Wang Xiaorong?”

Second Wolf interjected, “This shadowy figure lurked outside your door in dusty black robes. Shouldn’t I be cautious?”

“You’re not wrong. My thanks, brother. Had you slain my ally, I’d bear eternal guilt.”

“I act for your safety. Rest assured—I’m no bloodthirsty madman,” Second Wolf retorted, drinking deeply. “Rushed back without pause after passing Lin Qiaoqiao’s town. Two days’ hard riding—nearly killed the horse.”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu pressed Wang Jun: “Does Wang Xiaorong have news? What does she say?”

“The Young Mistress insists you follow her arrangements for guaranteed success.”

“What arrangements? Am I still to visit the Demon Soul Sect?”

“Unclear. Likely not. She may have the Demon Lord meet you elsewhere. When you depart with Senior Brother Yan Zhao today, you’ll pass her town. There, you’ll receive further instructions.”

“So I’ll learn my next steps upon meeting her?”

“Precisely.”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. “I detest being led by the nose.”

Second Wolf, knowing Guan Yu’s distaste for manipulation, offered, “Shall I scout ahead?”

“No. I’ll humor her this once. Never again.”

Sensing Guan Yu’s displeasure, Wang Jun excused himself. “My message is delivered. Rest well—you’ve journeyed all night.”

After Wang Jun left, Second Wolf asked, “Aren’t you curious about home?”

Guan Yu remained taciturn, unsettled by Wang Xiaorong’s high-handedness yet resolved to comply this final time. “How fares everyone?”

“Doubt you care—your thoughts dwell on that Wang Xiaorong. ‘One’s own children are best, others’ wives are fairest’—how true!” Second Wolf teased.

“Enough! I’ve little time before my mission. Speak plainly.”

“Exhausted, but seeing you revives me. All are well but miss you dearly. Xue Jing nearly followed...”

“She didn’t come?!” Guan Yu interjected anxiously.

“Relax—I dissuaded her. Assured them you’re safe here breaking your seal. Lin Qiaoqiao’s testimony finally calmed them.”

“Good. And the Feng Family?”

“Quiet. Before leaving, I had Hou Jinshun consolidate forces in Qiaoyuan District. The Yu Gang eradicated a minor faction. Our defenses there are ironclad—even the Fengs would hesitate.”

“Excellent. Why didn’t they relocate to Huayu Corporation as I instructed?”

“They refused—insisted on waiting at home. Lü Mei and Lan Yu wished to remain near family. I acquiesced.”

Noticing the large bundle, Guan Yu asked, “What’s this?”

“Supplies!” Second Wolf unveiled charging banks, flashlights, batteries, vacuum-sealed steaks. “Nearly died bringing these. Met spectral barriers—violent winds bearing sword energy! Lost one pack protecting this. My horse vanished then reappeared miraculously. Torrential rains nearly drowned me. This world...it’s not our own.”

Guan Yu frowned—likely evidence of dimensional instability. “These electronics are waterlogged.”

“Let them dry. The food’s safe—Zhenzi specially sent these.” Second Wolf sighed. “Even so...this realm resists our technology.”

Guan Yu pondered—perhaps cosmic balance prevented modern devices from disrupting this world. As Second Wolf unpacked, both wondered what new trials awaited.
