“How… how were you able to withstand the attack of Lingbo’s Subtle Sword?” Xia Tianfeng stared at Guan Yu’s unscathed figure, his voice trembling with disbelief.

Guan Yu chuckled lightly, spreading his hands. “Didn’t you hear Murong Yu say it during the day? I fell from a ten-thousand-foot cliff and emerged without a scratch. My offensive capabilities might be lacking at present, but I have one notable trait—I’m remarkably durable!”

In the past, such a boast from Guan Yu would have provoked Xia Tianfeng’s derision. Yet witnessing it firsthand now extinguished all skepticism.

“Brother Guan Yu, I’ve truly witnessed your prowess today! With an ally like you, dominating Yongzhou City seems trivial. Even conquering the entire Blue Beauty Continent feels within reach!”

“Hahaha! Young Master Xia flatters me too much.” Guan Yu waved dismissively. “I know my limits better than anyone. Such excessive praise might hinder my growth!”

Xia Tianfeng nodded awkwardly. “A fair point. Very well. Should anyone in Yongzhou City dare trouble you henceforth, seek me out. As Moon’er’s friend, I’ll stand for you!”

**Chapter 1306: The Master of the Golden Auction House**

Guan Yu knew Xia Tianfeng’s words held weight. As the young master of the Black Dragon Mercenary Corps, lacking such audacity would render him unworthy of leading the foremost of the Ten Dark Mercenary Groups!

After their spar, fatigue tugged at Guan Yu. He bid farewell to Xia Tianfeng, Huang Wensheng, and the others. Returning to the main hall with Amy, he found a towering figure seated within—none other than Shituo, whom he hadn’t seen all day.

“Elder Shituo, where have you been all day? Your absence was notable.”

Shituo shot him a sidelong glance. “Unlike you, idling about with a girl, I’ve duties as a guardian here. Understand?”

Guan Yu suppressed a sigh. *This old man’s temper is foul. A simple inquiry provokes such ire!*

“Boy, are you cursing me in your heart?”

“Ah… Elder Shituo, how could I? I revere you deeply!” Guan Yu forced a laugh.

Shituo snorted. “Your thoughts are written plain on your face. But enough—I heard you stole the spotlight at today’s auction.”

The mention reminded Guan Yu of the mysterious ring now adorning his finger. “Merely rumors! Don’t lend them credence, Elder!”

“Rumors? Would White Steward’s words be mere gossip?”

“White Steward? Ah…” Guan Yu grimaced inwardly. *That Snow Lan! She watched idly as I nearly brawled, then slandered me afterward. Vile woman!*

As he muttered under his breath, a velvety voice purred beside him:

“Little Brother Guan Yu… Are you maligning Snow Lan in your heart?”

Before he could react, Bai Xuelan’s fragrance enveloped him, her porcelain skin pressing close. Guan Yu endured her teasing while marveling, *Do they truly read my thoughts?*

“Sister Snow Lan, you jest! Why didn’t you aid me earlier? Did you wish to watch me beaten to death?”

“Perish the thought! With your skills, how many present could truly challenge you? As for that yapping Murong Yu—pay him no heed. This is Yongzhou, not Jinzhou. His bark outweighs his bite here.”

Guan Yu nodded, realizing Bai Xuelan’s calculated restraint.

“Another question—”

“The 100,000 gold coins?” she interjected.

“Yes… Was it your doing?”

To his surprise, she shook her head. “Though fond of you, I’d never bestow such a fortune. That sum exceeds even my means.”

“Then… Elder Shituo?”

The guardian shrugged. “Ten coins, perhaps. Ten thousand? Impossible.”

“Neither of you? Then who—”

Bai Xuelan smiled cryptically. “The master of this Golden Auction House—Jinx.”

“Jinx? Not human?”

“Correct. He’s of dragon kin.”

“Dragon kin?!” Guan Yu spluttered.

“Why the shock? Doesn’t this little one call you ‘Dragon Brother’?” She gestured to Amy. “Meet him. You might become fast friends.”

Guan Yu’s stomach dropped. *A fake dragon meeting the real deal? Disaster!* More pressing was Amy’s faith—her constant “Dragon Brother” address hinged on this deception.

“Wow! Dragon Brother found family!” Amy clapped. “You must go!”

Seizing her wrist, Guan Yu whispered urgently, “Want me to stay? Then never ask this again. True dragons would take me far away—forever.”

Amy paled. “No! Dragon Brother stays! Never see them!”

“There, there.” He patted her head. “I’ll remain.”

Bai Xuelan watched this manipulation with wry amusement. “Shameless, deceiving a child.”

“Sister Snow Lan mean! Dragon Brother never lies!” Amy huffed.

“As you wish.” The stewardess shrugged, exiting with the girl.

**Chapter 1307: Swearing to Kill Him**

Alone with Shituo, Guan Yu faced piercing scrutiny. “You’re no dragon. Why the pretense?”

“Two reasons: dragon reputation aids travel, and hides my magic.”

“Magic? How does a human reek so of sorcery?”

Guan Yu recounted his trials in the Elvenwood—omitting his otherworldly origin—while Shituo’s eyes narrowed at the crystal toad’s mention.

“Countless would kill for that treasure in your blood.”

“My blood?!”

“A jest—mostly. But envy drives men mad. That Murong Yu…”

“Him I’ll handle.”

Shituo snorted. “A royal lapdog. But persistent pests require… permanent solutions.”

Chastened, Guan Yu changed tack. “Elder, return with me to Elvenwood. Locke—the traitor who cast me down the cliff—poisons the World Tree! He’d sacrifice even Amy for power!”

The guardian’s composure shattered. “He dares?! Using our clan’s forbidden curses?! I’ll skin that whelp alive!”

**Chapter 1308: Consent**

Shituo’s roar shook the hall. “The World Tree’s decay spells doom for elves!”

“Precisely! Without aid, their kind faces extinction.”

“But I…” Conflict twisted Shituo’s features.

“What grudge stands between you and Elder Allen?”

“None!” The denial came too quick. Guan Yu pressed until Shituo relented:

“Long ago, I helped Allen seize elven leadership. He promised alliance against humans… then abandoned us.”

“Yet you’ll help now?”

Silence. Then a growl: “For the World Tree… and Amy. I’ll go.”
