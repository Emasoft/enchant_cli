While conversing with Huo Lingling, Guan Yu casually glanced across the training grounds. His eyes happened to meet Hu Xiaohai's venomous glare directed at him. Rather than feeling intimidated, Guan Yu found this comical. Having weathered countless storms, he'd never considered petty characters like Hu Xiaohai worth his attention. Yet as the saying goes – sometimes trouble finds you even when you avoid it. This time, Guan Yu might have indeed encountered such trouble.

"A man who can't even control his own emotions persists in opposing me. How absurd?" Guan Yu murmured. "The road to heaven lies open, yet you choose the path to hell."

On the training grounds, Griffin's crushing defeat had instilled fear of Guan Yu's prowess among the others. Those who failed the trials yet sought entry to the Magic Training Class turned their hopes to other disciples. As afternoon shadows lengthened, matches concluded one after another until the arena settled into stillness.

Just as Guan Yu prepared to depart, a young woman came running. "Brother Guan Yu!"

The silver-bell voice made him turn. A finely dressed girl approached at a trot. When she drew near, Guan Yu recognized Liu Chuntian (Spring Sky).

"Something urgent?" His tone carried frost, still smarting from her previous misunderstanding – an incident he'd never bothered to explain.

Liu Chuntian hadn't expected his lingering resentment. Assuming he'd forgotten, the awkward silence stretched until she forced a smile. "I... came to congratulate you, Brother Guan Yu."

"Thanks." His reply remained terse, each syllable clipped.

At that moment, Huo Lingling approached from afar. She seized Guan Yu's arm in a possessive gesture, as if staking claim before her rival.

Though no longer fond of Liu Chuntian, Guan Yu bore her no hatred. Wishing to avoid a feminine quarrel, he attempted to lead Huo Lingling away. But Liu Chuntian called out: "Tomorrow begins formal magic training. My grandfather will instruct us. I hope you'll attend."

Guan Yu halted mid-step. "Your grandfather? Liu Yishou (One-Hand Liu)?"

Nodding eagerly, Liu Chuntian continued: "Yes! After losing contact with you, Grandfather and I searched everywhere. You sacrificed so much for Barren Town. Our people never properly thanked you. Heaven guided us here, only to find you... bereft of magic..."

"Enough!" Huo Lingling cut in sharply. She knew of Guan Yu's vanished powers but avoided the subject to spare him pain.

"Apologies," Huo Lingling declared, tightening her grip on Guan Yu's arm. "We've already made plans to visit Jinzhou City tomorrow. Perhaps another time."

Onlookers stared agog. This icy princess who treated others with indifference now clung to Guan Yu with shocking intimacy.

Liu Chuntian sighed, disappointment etched on her features. As the Huntian Sect's princess, Huo Lingling's status left no room for defiance. Defeated, Liu Chuntian withdrew.

Watching her lonely retreat, Guan Yu rolled his eyes. "Must you reject her so cruelly?"

"Wasn't that your intention?" Huo Lingling blinked innocently.

"Well... yes... but need you be so blunt?" He shook his head. "Nevermind. What's this about Jinzhou?"

"I've been cooped up here forever!" She pouted. "Consider it celebrating your restored talents!"

"Fine, but no mischief. If you wander off, I won't come searching."

"You'd like that, wouldn't you?" She stuck out her tongue. "I'll stick closer than your shadow! Annoy you to death!"

Guan Yu shrugged at her childish antics. "Observe the crowd's stares. Imagine what they're thinking."

"Let them stare!" She waved dismissively. "Only my cared-for opinions matter."

"And you're certain of their approval?" he teased.

Huo Lingling's porcelain cheeks flushed crimson. She pinched his arm viciously. "Take that back!"

Grimacing through the pain as whispers swirled around them, Guan Yu mused on the adage: "Like a mute tasting bitter herbs – suffering beyond words."

As they walked, Huo Lingling suddenly asked: "Do you resent me for keeping you from magic lessons?"

"Even without power, I remember every advanced technique." Guan Yu shook his head. "Liu Yishou's teachings? Mere yellow-tier spells. Useful for novices, but worthless to me."

Rather than arrogance, Huo Lingling heard justified confidence. She knew once recovered, Guan Yu would rank among Huntian Sect's top three – surpassed only by her father Huo Zhentian and Elder Suoluo.

What truly irked her was Liu Chuntian's opportunism. During Guan Yu's落魄 days as a "useless cripple", she'd offered no aid despite owing him Barren Town's salvation. Now seeing his resurgence, the hypocrite sought reconciliation – a shift that filled Huo Lingling with feminine unease.

Meanwhile on the observation platform, Sect Master Huo Zhentian watched the departing pair with mixed emotions. "Today marks Huntian's glory – both Lingling's surprise and Guan Yu's exceeding expectations. Yet... something troubles me. My daughter's future with this youth... I pray my foreboding proves false."

Returning to his quarters, Guan Yu collapsed onto a chair. "Exhausting, but worth it. At least I've reclaimed some dignity."

Changing clothes, he retrieved auction-acquired pills. Following Bicamao's instructions, he brewed a basin of Foundation Elixir. Stripping swiftly, he plunged into the glowing liquid. Cooling energy seeped into his pores as he closed his eyes.

Memories of the day's trials surfaced. "All worlds share one truth – power commands respect. Without strength, excellence goes unseen."

His thoughts turned to Amy. How long since their parting? What torment did she endure with the Wolf Tribe? If Patriarch Allen knew his precious daughter's plight... "Wait for me, Amy. Fifteen days – I swear! The Wolf Clan will pay in blood!" His eyes glinted ferociously, revealing a darkness absent in daylight.

Contemplating Wolf Tianhun and Wolf Tianba's might, Guan Yu acknowledged current weakness. Yet survival proved heaven's will for his resurgence. Come the Challenge Tournament's top three ranking, unrestricted access to the Scripture Vault's arcane scrolls awaited – his true objective.

"Hu Xiaohai," Guan Yu murmured, observing sweat beading on reinvigorated skin. "Hone your skills. I crave worthy opposition, not feeble sport."

A knock interrupted his cultivation. "Brother Guan Yu? Are you there?"

"Wait! Don't enter!" Naked in his elixir bath, Guan Yu recognized the voice instantly.

"Didn't catch that!" came the oblivious reply. The door creaked open.

"Stay out!" Guan Yu channeled qi explosively. A shockwave sent Huo Lingling tumbling backward.

"Oww! What's happening?" Her tearful complaint pierced the door. Peeking through the crack, Guan Yu's heart twinged at her tear-streaked face.

Meanwhile, Wang Xiao passing Guan Yu's usual training hill found it deserted. Recalling the youth's haggard state the previous night, concern propelled him downhill. Guan Yu awoke cautiously, testing limbs for residual paralysis from yesterday's ordeal. To his astonishment, arms once ravaged now bore unblemished skin.

"How?" He marveled. "Yesterday's agony should've left scars..."

The door burst open. "Why skip training? Trouble?" Wang Xiao demanded.

"Merely overslept." Guan Yu rose, avoiding mention of last night's tribulation. "Shall we?"

Diverging paths at the courtyard, Guan Yu headed west. Reaching the summit, he launched into fist drills. Enhanced power shocked him – last night's torment had tempered his flesh beyond expectation.

Testing on a boulder, his punch shattered stone. "Fourth meridian unblocked brings exponential growth!" Though pleased, he recognized this mere stepping stone. The true path demanded relentless grinding.

As dusk fell, Wang Xiao discovered Guan Yu amidst pulverized rock. "You missed morning drills!"

"Apologies, Father. Won't recur."

Left alone, Guan Yu contemplated the shattered boulder. "Each meridian amplifies force geometrically." His gaze hardened. "Hu Xiaohai... better prepare."
