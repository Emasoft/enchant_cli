“What do you mean? Are you saying I deliberately barged in and stripped for you to see?” Mo Ling huffed as she stood up, storming to the bathroom door. She yanked it open and charged out, glaring fiercely at Guan Yu.

"Not... but that's literally what happened! Uh... I mean the sequence of events!" Guan Yu frantically waved his hands in explanation.

Mo Ling stared at him with venomous intensity, her expression resembling that of someone confronting their father's murderer. "You shameless pervert! Peeping on people using the bathroom and still making excuses! I'll... I'll bite you to death!" Though she vaguely understood Guan Yu's account was likely true, having him spell it out made her feel like she'd intentionally paraded herself before him.

Leaping forward, she seized his arm and sank her teeth into it. Through his thin shirt, Guan Yu gritted his teeth without resisting, letting her gnaw viciously as he pleaded, "Don't be angry, Sister Mo! My fault. I shouldn't have stood there watching. But I genuinely didn't react in time! And... well... curiosity got the better of me."

Expecting him to recoil from the pain, Mo Ling was stunned when Guan Yu remained motionless, calmly enduring her bite while continuing explanations.

"Are you stupid? Doesn't this hurt?" She released his arm with a frustrated shake, hands on hips as she pouted angrily.

"As long as you're not angry anymore... I'm sorry! Next time such... opportunities arise, I'll turn away immediately. Deal?" Guan Yu murmured apologetically.

Mo Ling exhaled sharply and lifted his sleeve, revealing a row of purple teeth marks. "Serves you right! Remember this lesson!" She prodded the bruise with feigned indifference, though guilt flickered across her face.

When Guan Yu winced, she wrinkled her nose childishly. "Wait here. I'll finish using the bathroom first, then continue lecturing you!" With that, she flounced back into the bathroom.

Guan Yu nearly choked - she hadn't even completed her original bathroom visit! As he turned to sit down, the sudden sound of rushing water froze him mid-step.

The oppressive silence amplified every noise.

Inside, Mo Ling flushed crimson on the toilet seat, mortified. That jerk must have heard everything!

Practicing mental chastity mantras, Guan Yu hurried to the desk and lit a cigarette. The acrid smoke calmed his racing thoughts.

"You smoke?" Mo Ling emerged drying her hands, eyeing the curling tendrils with surprise.

Guan Yu shrugged. "I'm an adult. What's the fuss?"

"Looking all innocent but rotten inside! Youth wasted on bad habits!" She plopped onto the bed, scrutinizing him.

"What bad habits?"

"Peeping on girls!" She sat bolt upright, triumphant.

**Chapter 23: Detection System – Seeking Favorites**

Guan Yu's face fell. "That was a misunderstanding! Stop bringing it up! I'm not that despicable!"

Biting back laughter at his pitiful expression, Mo Ling teased, "Flatter me properly and I'll drop it."

"Sister Mo, you're stunning - beautiful face, perfect figure..." He flicked ash, smirking.

"Sweet-talker!" She rolled her eyes, though visibly pleased. "Not that!"

"...And kind-hearted, never angry..."

"Enough! Sleep now." She curled up on the bed, patting the space beside her.

"Worried I'll bite again?" She teased, chin propped on hand.

"No... It's stressful sharing a bed."

"Why?"

"Afraid I can't control... thoughts. You smell so nice..."

"Enough! Dirty-minded brat! Sleep! Does your arm hurt?"

"Manageable." He gingerly lay beside her.

Under glaring lights, both stared wide-eyed at the ceiling. Thirty silent minutes passed, their heartbeats audible.

Mercurial as the moon - one moment fierce, the next tender. If only he could read her mind...

The thought triggered golden light in his mind. The bronze coin reappeared, rotating amidst strange symbols that flooded his consciousness. Alertness surged.

**Detection System Activated.**

New text appeared beside the coin. Another ability unlocked through mere thought? Could he wish for anything? Imagining emperorship yielded nothing. Disappointed, he turned to find Mo Ling stealing glances.

Their eyes met. She flinched away, lashes fluttering.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu activated Detection. Heat surged through his eyes. Information cascaded:

*Primary Detection: Target exhibits nervousness, shyness. Moderate affection detected. Permitted intimacy: handholding, embracing. Seeks fairytale romance.*

Stunned, Guan Yu nearly gasped. She liked him?

While reveling in this revelation, he noticed Mo菱's pretense of sleep. Boldness swelling, he reached for her hand.

**Chapter 24: Sleeping Embrace**

Her soft palm ignited fireworks in his chest. Feigning palmistry, he reactivated Detection, learning of her political family background - details even her colleague didn't know.

"Your love line..." He pretended surprise. "Matches mine perfectly - simple, enduring affection. Wonder who'll win such beauty?"

Maintaining the charade, he clasped both her hands. "Holding hands while sleeping isn't improper, right?"

Mo Ling's racing heartbeat betrayed her act. Guan Yu's masculine scent enveloped her, the contact sparking unexpected joy.

"Need a pillow..." he mused aloud.

As he hesitated to embrace her, Mo Ling "sleepily" rolled closer. Seizing the chance, he enfolded her quilt-wrapped form.

Though separated by layers, euphoria overwhelmed him. His father's tuition fees felt justified if this led to bringing home such a beauty.

Pressed against his chest, Mo Ling's heart threatened to burst. His warmth felt unexpectedly comforting.

Dawn found them entangled - her leg hooked over his hip, his hand crept beneath her clothes to cup a breast.

"AHHH!" She screamed, kicking wildly before recalling the night's events.

"You... YOU!" She pummeled him with a pillow, face crimson.

Rubbing sleep from his eyes, Guan Yu stared bewildered at the assault, completely unaware of his nocturnal transgression.
