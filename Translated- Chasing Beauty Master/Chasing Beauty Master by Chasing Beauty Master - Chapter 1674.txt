“Two hundred taels is no small sum. If you refuse to repay, we’ll have no choice but to take you to our boss. You can imagine the consequences. This isn’t an empty threat.” The man exchanged a glance with his companion. Suddenly, the thug behind Lin Chen kicked the back of his knees.

Caught off guard, Lin Chen staggered and dropped to one knee. As he tried to move, cold steel pressed against his throat.

Turning his head, he saw a foot-long blade glinting at his neck. The assailant had him pinned in a half-kneeling position. Fear surged through Lin Chen—captured, penniless, and utterly helpless. This was disaster. If taken away, he’d face unimaginable horrors.

“Easy now! Let’s talk this through. That blade’s dangerous—one slip and everyone loses.” Lin Chen forced exaggerated calm into his voice.

“No more delays. Move!” A kick slammed into Lin Chen’s ribs as another thug seized his bag and Cloudsteel Sword, eliminating any escape chance.

“Wait! Where are you taking me?” Lin Chen shouted, hoping nearby disciples might hear. If allies came, there’d be hope. Otherwise, this abduction meant certain death.

“I never refused payment! Give me until afternoon!” Lin Chen roared. “I’ve no silver on me—how can I pay now?”

His desperate cries gave the blade-wielder pause. “Your false identity voids any extensions. You’ll be detained until repayment.”

Zou Xiaoyu entered, unfazed by Lin Chen’s predicament. “Gentlemen, you’ve found him. Our breakfast spread awaits—shall we dine first?”

“No. This fugitive goes to confinement.” The thug shoved Lin Chen forward. Zou Xiaoyu merely glanced at him, silent.

“Lady Xiaoyu, intercede! I promised afternoon repayment!” Lin Chen pleaded. “They’ve blades at my neck—this savagery!”

Zou Xiaoyu replied coolly, “This is their jurisdiction. I’ve no authority here. Farewell, Young Master Lin.”

“Halt!” Guanyu’s voice rang from above. He’d witnessed everything. Descending, he assessed the thugs and Zou Xiaoyu—her sharp, cunning eyes betrayed hidden depths.

“Why detain my friend?” Guanyu asked, already knowing the answer.

“Your friend owes two hundred taels under false pretenses.” A thug waved the loan contract.

Guanyu feigned shock. “You borrowed using a fake identity? Foolish! Why not seek me instead?”

“Enough lectures! Help me!” Lin Chen begged.

“Mind your tone,” Guanyu said coldly. “If you want help, earn it.”

Zou Xiaoyu interjected, “Sir, notify his family or steward. Payment’s the only solution.”

Guanyu ignored Lin Chen, addressing Zou Xiaoyu. “He’s a fraud with no family here. You’re surnamed Zou—related to Prince Zou?”

“Yes. Prince Zou is my adoptive grandfather.”

Guanyu’s brow furrowed. “Your father served as Prince Zou’s third captain during his fiefdom establishment here.”

“Yes. Father accompanied Prince Zou to Liaozhou. How do you know this?”

“I’m Prince Zou’s longtime confidant,” Guanyu lied smoothly. “Passing through, I intended to visit him. Sadly, he’s summoned to court.”

Lin Chen brightened—maybe Guanyu’s connections could save him.

Zou Xiaoyu studied Guanyu, sensing his authority. “If you’re truly his friend, notify his family for repayment.”

“His identity’s fake. He’s a penniless outsider. We’ll take him to the boss,” a thug growled.

“Wait!” Guanyu intervened. “Take me to your superior. I’ll negotiate.”

Zou Xiaoyu hesitated. Despite suspicions, she led Guanyu to her uncle’s courtyard where he trained daily.

“Uncle, this gentleman claims acquaintance with Prince Zou,” Zou Xiaoyu introduced.

Her uncle—a burly man with battle scars—eyed Guanyu skeptically. “Prove it.”

Guanyu smiled. “Prince Zou’s third captain died protecting him en route to court. Shall I describe his final moments?”

Zou Xiaoyu paled. “What? Father’s dead?”

“Regrettably, yes. He fell valiantly against assassins. Prince Zou mourns him deeply.”

Zou Xiaoyu staggered, tears welling. Guanyu steadied her. “Honor his sacrifice. Now, release my friend. I’ll settle his debt.”

The uncle scowled. “Two hundred taels. Now.”

Guanyu tossed a heavy purse. “Count it.”

As the thugs scrambled for coins, Guanyu whispered to Zou Xiaoyu, “Visit Prince Zou in court. He’ll explain everything.”

Lin Chen rubbed his freed neck, muttering, “Never again...”

Guanyu smirked. “Remember this lesson. Next time, I won’t intervene.”

The dawn sun illuminated Liaozhou’s streets as the trio exited, shadows of intrigue lingering behind them.
