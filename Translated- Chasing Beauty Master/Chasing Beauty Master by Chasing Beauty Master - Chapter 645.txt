“Oh?” The portly man cast a meaningful glance at Hou Jinshun before approaching Guan Yu. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing,” he said casually, though his eyes signaled his men to keep watch on Hou.

Hou Jinshun’s heart sank as he observed the man’s smiling facade. When he tried to speak again, several bodyguards blocked his path.

“Let me go!” Hou snarled, glaring at the men restraining him.

The guards wore pained expressions. “Brother Hou, don’t make this difficult for us…”

Meanwhile, the portly man reached Guan Yu’s side. A chair was hastily brought for him. Sitting leisurely, he scrutinized Guan Yu from head to toe, lingering on the unconscious woman slung over the young man’s back. “So you’re the one who injured my sworn brother?”

Nodding calmly, Guan Yu met his gaze. “I did. What of it?”

“What of it?” The man burst into laughter as if hearing the world’s greatest joke. “Simple. Leave your arms and legs here, then crawl away!”

Guan Yu chuckled darkly. “A bar owner who judges without inquiry? And if I refuse?”

“Then I’ll make you comply.” The man leaned back and snapped his fingers. Five bare-chested bruisers emerged, cracking their knuckles as they advanced like wolves eyeing prey.

Seeing no chance for reasoning, Guan Yu gently laid the woman on a sofa before turning to face the thugs. Cracking his neck, he smirked. *Five sandbags. Perfect for practicing.*

“First you close the doors, then unleash your lapdogs,” Guan Yu taunted, thumb raised mockingly. “Will the master mutt join later? Though given your blubber, I doubt you could fight a puppy. Pathetic.”

The portly man’s face purpled with rage. “CRUSH HIM! 100,000 per arm!” The bounty electrified his men, their eyes gleaming with bloodlust.

**Chapter 1638: The Objective**

Hou Jinshun watched from behind San Yan (“Three Eyes”), shaking his head at Guan Yu’s recklessness. *Had he shown humility, a beating and six months’ recovery would’ve sufficed. But insulting Three Eyes as a dog? Fatal mistake.*

He underestimated Guan Yu.

A whipkick launched one thug airborne, crashing into another. A gut punch left a third vomiting blood. A final rib-cracking kick sent the last flying. Within three moves, four men lay broken, the fifth fleeing in terror.

Three Eyes gaped, sweat beading his forehead. These were Thai boxing champions he’d recruited – each capable of defeating ten ordinary men. Yet Guan Yu dismantled them like toys.

*This power... only those Nightmare Creatures possess such strength.* Memories of a recent encounter chilled him – a being who slaughtered dissenters with casual brutality. Now Guan Yu’s aura radiated similar primal dominance, scattering the remaining guards like startled mice.

“Still want my limbs?” Guan Yu asked mildly, taking a seat.

Three Eyes scrambled up despite his towering bulk. “T-This lowly one erred! Spare me!” He began slapping his own bloated cheeks rhythmically. When Guan Yu remained silent, he roared at his men: “Why aren’t you beating yourselves?!”

Soon the bar echoed with slaps and chanted apologies. Only Guan Yu, the unconscious woman, and Hou remained exempt.

“May I leave now?” Guan Yu finally asked, watching Three Eyes’ face swell to porcine proportions.

“Y-Yes! Please!” The mob boss nearly wept with relief.

**Chapter 1639: Take Me As Your Disciple**

As Guan Yu exited carrying the woman, Hou Jinshun made his decision. “Wait! Master!” He caught up, panting. “Take me as your disciple! Make me a pseudo-adept! I’ll serve you faithfully!”

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. “What can you offer? As a fighter? A financier?”

Hou’s shoulders slumped. “I... I’m just a wastrel.” Yet desperation glimmered beneath his shame. Years of mediocrity had crystallized into this gamble – his only chance to transcend his pathetic existence.

**Chapter 1640: Become My Brother**

Guan Yu studied the groveling man. Hou’s bar intervention, though ineffective, revealed lingering integrity. *A lecher, yes, but not a predator like that ‘Old Blade’*.

“Become my brother instead,” Guan Yu declared.

Hou blinked. “Brother? But I’m...”

“Unworthy? Perhaps. But even weeds grow toward sunlight.” Guan Yu’s gaze pierced him. “Will you grasp this light, or rot in shadows?”

The question hung between them – an offer to rewrite destiny itself.
