“Look, it’s the foremost figure of the Demon Sovereign Continent—Ye Wuhen! And Ming Hanfeng, who succeeded him!” Sharp-eyed onlookers immediately recognized them, spreading the news excitedly. “Where? Let me see! It really is them!”

Ming Hanfeng frowned in displeasure, disliking being gawked at like circus animals. In contrast, Ye Wuhen remained utterly unperturbed, as if the crowd didn’t exist.

“Ye Wuhen?” Ming Hanfeng questioned skeptically. He hadn’t expected the demon realm to summon *him*. Though their reputations were comparable, they’d never met—until now. Ignoring Ming Hanfeng, Ye Wuhen strode directly toward Guan Yu with a smile. “Apologies, little sister. Are you unharmed?”

Guan Yu snapped out of her daze, her cold gaze flickering as she studied the smiling youth. She glanced longingly at Ming Hanfeng before turning to leave. As she passed Bingsu, a fleeting murderous glint flashed in her eyes. Sensing the frost in her aura, Ye Wuhen’s smile stiffened momentarily before resuming. *Seems the Netherworld isn’t so dull after all.*

The moment Guan Yu departed, Ming Hanfeng felt an inexplicable pang of loss, as though something vital had slipped away. “I never imagined *you* would come to retrieve me,” he remarked coolly.

“I merely happened to be cultivating here,” Ming Hanfeng retorted icily—a half-truth. He’d arrived days earlier, intending to leave until Bingsu appeared, demanding he await the demon realm’s envoy. Ye Wuhen hummed indifferently. “Hm.”

Mu Bai, recognizing one as the Netherworld prince and the other as the Demon Realm’s heir, dared not slacken. “Why not visit the City Lord’s Manor? I am Mu Bai,” he suggested, glancing worriedly toward Guan Yu’s retreating figure. *With her strength, she should be safe...*

“Agreed,” Ming Hanfeng assented flatly. Ye Wuhen nodded, and the group swaggered toward the manor. Upon returning, Guan Yu faced Hu Xiaohai’s confusion: “Why not reveal yourself to your brother?” After years of longing to reunite with her mother and brother, her refusal baffled him.

“The one behind my brother... belongs to *him*,” she replied tersely. Realization dawned on Hu Xiaohai.

“City Lord, pardon the intrusion,” Ming Hanfeng addressed Mu Fengchen with a hint of respect. The Mu family’s generations-long guardianship of Mapleleaf City against foreign invasions commanded his esteem.

“No need for formalities, Your Highness,” Mu Fengchen replied hastily. As Mu Bai slipped away to seek Guan Yu, she too prepared to depart. They met midway. “Where are you off to, Xiuluo?” Mu Bai asked, perplexed.

“To the Royal Capital,” Guan Yu stated. Mu Bai froze—he’d anticipated her departure, but not so soon. Masking his dismay, he urged, “At least bid farewell to my father.”

Relenting under his hopeful gaze, Guan Yu nodded. Mu Bai exhaled in relief, leading her inside.

“Father! Xiuluo is leaving!” Mu Bai burst in, dragging Guan Yu. Mu Fengchen frowned at the interruption. “My apologies, Your Highnesses. My son lacks decorum.” Silence greeted him. *Have I offended them?*

Before he could apologize again, a stunned voice cut through: “You?!” Ming Hanfeng gaped at Guan Yu, an inexplicable joy surging within him. Ye Wuhen smirked devilishly—*we meet again.*

Guan Yu quickly composed herself. *Of course Ming Hanfeng, as the Netherworld prince, would be here.* “Xiuluo, are you departing?” Mu Fengchen asked weakly.

“Yes.”

“Where?”

“The Royal Capital.” Her gaze flickered toward Bingsu, who shuddered with foreboding.

“Why not accompany Mu Bai in a few days?” Mu Fengchen proposed, too frail to journey himself. “Together, then,” Ming Hanfeng interjected, inexplicably drawn to her. Ye Wuhen nodded—her presence promised amusement. Their subordinates exchanged baffled glances. *Since when do our masters act so... human?*

“Splendid!” Mu Fengchen agreed, relieved the princes would safeguard his son.

Guan Yu stifled irritation—*my journey decided without consultation?*—yet secretly welcomed the chance to stay near her brother.

Chaos erupted as Situ Jiannan barged in. “City Lord! Devourer Beasts!”

Mu Fengchen paled. In his weakened state, even one Devourer could obliterate them—let alone Mu Bai, merely an Earthly Sovereign.

“Devourer Beasts?” Ye Wuhen sneered. “Are they formidable?”

“Solitary, spherical demonic beasts,” Mu Fengchen explained. “They cannibalize to grow stronger and larger.”

Ye Wuhen’s mockery faded—his instincts warned of hidden dangers. Mu Bai, ever trusting his father, volunteered: “Let me handle the city’s defense!”

“We’ll investigate,” Ming Hanfeng declared, Bingsu at his heels. Ye Wuhen’s retinue followed. Mu Fengchen, supported by his family, trailed anxiously. Guan Yu sighed but joined.

At the gates, Rong Shi and guards strained against battering Devourers. “The City Lord’s here!” Relief turned to confusion at the princes’ presence.

Ye Wuhen and Ming Hanfeng surveyed the horde. “Leave these to us,” Ye Wuhen ordered his subordinates. Ming Hanfeng and Bingsu dove into the fray.

Underestimating the beasts proved fatal—the weakest were Mid-Earthly Sovereigns, with over a dozen Mid-Saint Sovereigns! Yet the princes, both Saint Sovereigns, fought relentlessly, their energies weaving a lethal tapestry.

Guan Yu watched, awed. *Brother’s already a Mid-Saint Sovereign. I must catch up!* Onlookers gaped—*teenage Saint Sovereigns? How?!*

Inside, subterranean rumbles heralded hulking Earthfiend Beasts. “Father, let me defend the city!” Mu Bai insisted, leaping into danger before Mu Fengchen could object.

“Mu’er!” the City Lord cried helplessly. Guan Yu observed Mu Bai’s stubborn valor with a knowing smile.

As outer defenses held, inner walls crumbled. Mu Bai, overwhelmed, faced certain death until a crimson blur intervened—Guan Yu.

“Your leg!” Mu Bai gasped as she kicked an Earthfiend, bone audibly cracking.

“Worry about yourself,” she snapped, bandaging the wound impassively. Drawing her Soul-Devouring Whip, she grinned. “Hu Xiaohai! Playtime!”

A shadowy beast materialized, baffling spectators. *A tamed demonic beast? Impossible!*

“This one’s mine,” Guan Yu declared, lunging at her attacker. Hu Xiaohai grumbled but obeyed, battling the rest.

Chaos ensued—Guan Yu darted between beasts, her whip spinning them into dazed collisions. When an Earthfiend ambushed her, she vanished, leaving it to smash into walls. *An afterimage?!*

Mu Bai pleaded: “Can we drive them beyond the city? The civilians...”

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. *Innocent?* Memories of her own betrayed innocence surfaced. Yet she relented. “Hu Xiaohai—expel them.”

Mu Bai’s compassion clashed with Guan Yu’s cynicism. Reluctantly, she ordered the evacuation. As Hu Xiaohai herded beasts outward, Guan Yu seethed—*why this sudden unease?*

**Chapter 1580: Beyond the Whip’s Reach**

The Earthfiend leader rallied its pack, ignoring Hu Xiaohai’s taunts. Guan Yu assessed the encircling horde, frustration mounting. *Why this restlessness?*

Mu Bai’s plea echoed: “They’re innocent!”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. *Innocence dies first in this world.* Yet she motioned Hu Xiaohai onward, her whip cracking like thunder.
