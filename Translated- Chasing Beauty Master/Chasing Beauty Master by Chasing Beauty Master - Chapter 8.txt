“Gravity doubled!” Just as the iron frame was about to crash onto his opponents, Guan Yu suddenly released his grip while amplifying the weight of the plaque once more!

*Thud—* With a muffled impact, the hundred-pound iron frame smashed mercilessly into the waists of two thugs ahead, sending their bodies flying like autumn leaves swept by the wind.

*Bang!* The iron frame landed half a meter before Guan Yu. Ignoring the two writhing on the ground clutching their backs, he glared furiously at the remaining gang members, swiftly hoisting the plaque again with a roar before charging forward.

“Is this bastard even human? He’s swinging that massive thing like it’s weightless!” The thugs who had been jeering moments earlier froze in terror, hesitating to advance. Yet while they faltered, Guan Yu surged forward relentlessly, wielding the iron frame like a whirlwind.

*Whoosh—* The weapon arced through the air with a howling gust, toppling three more men. Guan Yu then heaved the frame overhead and hurled it toward the remaining group.

*Clang!* The iron behemoth crashed through the crowd, raining down like a collapsing sky. Fortunately, gaps in the welded structure spared most—only two were struck on the shoulders and collapsed, while three others stood petrified within the frame’s hollow center, gaping at Guan Yu as if witnessing a vengeful deity.

**Chapter Eighteen: Scared to the Point of Wetting Himself**

Having felled nearly half his foes, Guan Yu’s battle spirit peaked. After flinging the iron frame, he strode toward the survivors like a war god incarnate. Even unarmed, he radiated confidence against the final few.

Terrified beyond reason, the remaining thugs watched as Guan Yu’s fist sent one man flying—a spray of blood accompanied the victim’s crash five meters away. The others dropped their weapons and fled. Even the less injured scrambled away, abandoning comrades to escape.

Only Feng Lei remained, slumped against a wall with an ashen face. His jaw trembled soundlessly, gulps of saliva echoing in his throat. He longed for wings to flee the impending beating. Bruised and battered, he’d left his hospital bed seeking revenge, only to watch his dozen allies fall within moments. Now, paralyzed by fear, he couldn’t even run.

As Guan Yu stormed toward him, Feng Lei frantically clasped his hands in pleading, but no words emerged. “I… I…” he stammered, shrinking under the crowd’s stares—until a sudden *splash* broke the silence.

Looking down, Feng Lei’s face twisted in humiliation: he’d wet himself. His jeans dripped audibly, drawing uproarious laughter from onlookers.

When Guan Yu seized his collar and raised a fist, Liu Shilei and Moling rushed over, pulling him back. “Stop! You’ll face real trouble if this escalates!” Moling urged in his ear.

Guan Yu glared at the fallen thugs. “Get up and scram! Remember—next time I see you, you’re dead meat!”

Feng Lei stumbled away, head bowed in shame. As a university teacher, this disgrace would haunt him forever.

**Chapter Nineteen: This Lady Isn’t Made of Tofu!**

After ensuring Liu Shilei and Moling’s safety, Guan Yu prepared to leave the dorm. “Let us escort you,” Liu Shilei insisted, fearing ambush. Moling chimed in eagerly, “Yes! If they’re still out there, I want to watch you fight again!”

Liu Shilei pinched Moling’s waist. “Troublemaker!” But Guan Yu finally relented under their insistence.

As they walked, a call summoned Liu Shilei to the principal’s office—police had arrived. Moling volunteered to accompany Guan Yu alone. “Don’t worry,” she reassured. “Shilei-jie handles the higher-ups well.”

At the campus gate, Guan Yu paused. “Go back. I’ll be fine.” Moling teased, “Then walk me back!” When he hesitated, she scoffed, “Scared I’ll bite?”

At the hostel entrance, Guan Yu insisted again. “I’m not some delicate flower!” Moling retorted, dragging him inside. Yet moments later, they spotted dozens of thugs gathering outside campus—reinforcements armed with clubs and pipes.

“Stay here!” Guan Yu growled, but Moling clung to him. “Are you insane? There’s fifty of them!” Her chest pressed against his back as she yanked him toward safety.

**Chapter Twenty: Come Sleep on the Bed**

Back in the hostel room, Moling perched on the bed. “Aren’t you afraid of so many?” she asked. Guan Yu shrugged. “Numbers mean nothing if they’re cowards.”

When Moling called Liu Shilei, they learned police were managing the mob. “Stay put,” Moling decided. “I’ll wait here till they leave.”

As midnight approached, tension thickened. Moling finally noticed their proximity and flushed, but held her ground. “You’re not staying alone,” Guan Yu insisted.

“Then share the bed,” she challenged, patting the mattress. “Unless you’re scared?”

Guan Yu’s pulse raced. “I don’t bite,” Moling added with a sly smile. “Unless provoked.”

Outside, the gang’s shouts echoed, but inside, an entirely different battle of nerves had begun.
