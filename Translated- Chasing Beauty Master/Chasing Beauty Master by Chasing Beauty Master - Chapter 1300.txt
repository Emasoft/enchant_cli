The next morning, Guan Yu rose early instead of sleeping in. Due to the injuries on his back preventing him from lying down comfortably and lingering pain, he had spent the night channeling spiritual energy to heal himself. After some restorative rest, he felt sufficiently recovered to start the day.

After breakfast, Guan Yu announced, “We’ll wait for Siqi and the others before heading down the mountain. My injuries are no longer serious.”

In truth, Guan Yu had barely slept all night, combining spiritual energy and internal energy to continuously heal his wounds. By dawn, his injuries had nearly vanished—a recovery speed that even surprised him.

However, he recalled Elder Lu’s instructions: they were not to descend the mountain until his return with further news. Guan Yu decided it was best to wait.

“Guan Yu, you were injured last night? How did that happen?” Aze asked.

“While walking in the woods, I was ambushed by a black-furred creature when I let my guard down,” Guan Yu replied tersely. To him, being wounded was shameful, but blaming it on a sneak attack softened the embarrassment.

“A black-furred creature? I’ve never heard of such a monster in Cloud Azure Sect. Are you sure?” Xiao Zhi questioned skeptically.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “Elder Lu identified it as the Bloodwing Technique from the Demon Sect’s Black Blood Ridge. This dark art transforms the user into a bat-like creature using spiritual energy. Those with higher cultivation can even manifest wings. The creature had apparently been hiding within our sect.”

“That dangerous? If it wounded even you, none of the disciples stand a chance against it!” Xiao Zhi exclaimed.

Guan Yu privately acknowledged the creature’s strength. His own unstable control over internal and spiritual energy was best kept secret. Still, among the younger disciples, none could rival that monster.

“True. All of you should stay vigilant. Last night, Elder Lu went to Tiger Summit Peak to inform the Sect Master. We’re to await orders here,” Guan Yu said.

At that moment, Siqi and Xiaotong entered. “Guan Yu, we heard you were injured! Are you alright?” Siqi asked urgently.

Guan Yu blinked. “How did you know? News travels fast.”

“At dawn, Tiger Summit Peak summoned Master for urgent discussions—likely a meeting of all Hall Masters. I heard it from the messenger,” Siqi explained.

“I see. My injury may delay our departure.”

“Yes. Tiger Summit Peak insists we wait until you’ve fully recovered.”

“But I’m nearly healed after working all night. We can leave now without issue,” Guan Yu insisted.

Xiao Zhi practically vibrated with excitement. Though this wasn’t a pleasure trip, he treated it as one.

“Look—Elder Lu returns!” Aze pointed skyward. A figure approached rapidly. Guan Yu smiled. “Good. I’ll request permission, then we depart.”

“Guan Yu, you seem well. No lasting effects?” Elder Lu asked upon landing.

“Completely recovered. See for yourself.” Guan Yu removed his outer robe, revealing bandage-free skin where wounds had sealed.

Elder Lu nodded. “The Sect Master says if you’re healed, your group may descend. Regarding last night’s incident—consider it unresolved. The Sect Master will handle it.”

As they prepared to leave, Elder Lu handed Guan Yu a small pouch. “What’s this?”

“Gold coins. I’m not wealthy, but these should aid your journey.”

Opening the pouch, Guan Yu gasped. “Damn, so many! Thank you, Elder Lu!” In this cultivation realm, currency took the form of ancient-style gold coins rather than paper money. The hefty pouch astonished everyone—including Xiao Zhi and Aze, who found Elder Lu’s “modest” claim laughable.

Elder Lu chuckled. “Save gratitude. Once you reach Qujiang City and Xiaotong’s wealthy uncle, you’ll have ample funds. Carrying more would burden you.”

Xiaotong gazed admiringly at Guan Yu. Marrying such a man promised lifelong luxury and happiness.

After final thanks, the group departed. Guide Ma Xiao led them downhill before bidding farewell.

**Chapter 3348: Wishful Thinking**

The journey from Cloud Azure Mountain to Qujiang City proved long. Traveling north on horseback, they reached a tiny hamlet by afternoon—a mere cluster of thatched huts serving as a roadside inn.

“Let’s rest and eat before continuing. The horses need respite,” Guan Yu suggested.

Entering the empty inn, two gaping servers stared at Siqi as if seeing a goddess.

After ordering, Guan Yu advised, “Siqi, Xiaotong—we must conceal our identities. Please wear veils. Siqi’s beauty alone could invite trouble.”

Siqi frowned. “Must we?”

“Siqi should, but why me?” Xiaotong smirked.

“Absolutely. I know you cherish your beauty, but this is a mission. Be grateful I’m not making you disguise as men,” Guan Yu declared.

Aze interjected, “We should alter how we address each other too. No more ‘senior sister’ or ‘brother’.”

“Agreed. Let’s pose as merchants,” Guan Yu nodded.

“Or siblings! Or couples!” Xiao Zhi leered, earning a glare from Guan Yu.

“Dream on, pervert! I’d sooner marry a ghost!” Xiaotong retorted.

Xiao Zhi’s eyes gleamed. “Then pretend with Guan Yu!” Xiaotong blushed, silently pleased—exactly his scheme to pair himself with Siqi.

“Enough. Siblings don’t work—we look unrelated. Any ideas?” Guan Yu asked.

The women stayed silent until Xiao Zhi pressed, “Your silence means agreement!”

Guan Yu cut in, “We’ll decide later. Remember—no spellcasting unless critical. Hide your artifacts.”

Xiaotong pouted. While others concealed weapons, her Cloud Azure Sword remained visible.

“Let me carry it,” Guan Yu offered. “Many travelers bear swords. Just don’t let it be recognized.”

Wrapping the hilt and spiritual orb in black cloth transformed the ordinary blade into something mysterious. “Now it looks imposing!” Xiao Zhi remarked, recalling a warrior’s similarly wrapped blade.

After meager meals of rock-hard buns, they resumed travel. Soon, their horses faltered—foaming and collapsing.

“The inn’s feed must’ve been poisoned!” Guan Yu realized.

Stranded in wilderness miles from the next town, Xiaotong groaned, “Twenty li on foot? Should we fly?”

“Sword flight is our sect’s signature. Too recognizable,” Guan Yu否决.

**Chapter 3350: Baffling**

As they debated, the horses lay exhausted. With night falling and no shelter, the group faced an uncertain path—their mission’s challenges only beginning.
