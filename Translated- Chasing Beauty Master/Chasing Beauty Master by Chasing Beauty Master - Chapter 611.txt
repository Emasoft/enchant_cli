**Chapter 1550: Unleashing the Killing**

Guan Yu’s consciousness continued to fade until she finally slipped into a coma. In the moment before she lost consciousness, the Soul-Devouring Whip ceased draining her blood and flew toward the Demonic Egg. A massive energy field erupted between the two, as if transferring something unseen. The demons froze in shock—what in the world was this?!

Meanwhile, Guan Yu lay unconscious, oblivious to the chaos around her. The demons, however, assumed she had been drained dry by her own weapon and perished. A smug relief washed over them—such a prodigious enemy would have been a nightmare if left alive!

A sharp *crack* jolted the demons from their triumph. The magic array on the Demonic Egg suddenly flared. “Ah! This light… it’s identical to the one from days ago!” a demon shrieked. The others snapped to attention, their eyes blazing with greed. This egg was their mission’s prize. According to the elders of Demon City, the treasure emerging this time held unfathomable power—either utterly worthless or a peerless artifact. Given the spectacle before them, it was clearly the latter!

The eggshell shattered completely, revealing a pitch-black head. “Is it an artifact spirit? Or a demonic beast?” The demons gaped in confusion. Inky hair veiled its face, but glimpses of jet-black fangs hinted at lethality. As the shell fell away, a small, human-like body emerged—save for its monstrous head. What *was* this creature?!

The lead demon stepped forward, curiosity overriding caution. He reached out to touch it, but the instant his finger made contact, searing pain shot through him. The creature clamped onto his fingertip, greedily sucking his blood. A chilling realization struck—this was how the human girl had supposedly died! Panicking, he tried to pull back, but the creature seized his right arm. A flash of claws severed it cleanly. “Ah—!! My hand! Damn you! I’ll kill you!” he roared, forgetting all orders from the elders.

“**Demonic Bone Howl!**”

“Boss, no!” The other demons lunged to stop him, but too late. A ghastly wail, like the cry of netherworld spirits, echoed across the forest. The demons clutched their ears, writhing in agony.

Just as they assumed the creature had perished in the attack, a shadow darted past. The lead demon’s head thudded to the ground. Before the others could react, their leader was dead.

“Boss!” one cried. “It—it killed him!” The demons stared in disbelief. A newborn creature slaying a Saintly Venerable? Impossible! Yet fear gripped them—what kind of monstrosity possessed such power, even in infancy?!

“Capture it!” a demon yelled. They unleashed a barrage of attacks: “**Inferno Sky!**” “**Gale Fury!**” But the creature dodged effortlessly, treating their assaults as a game. When the demons paused, exhausted, they nearly fainted—it was *playing* with them!

“We can’t catch it!” a yellow-haired demon spat, though his eyes gleamed with sly satisfaction. Suddenly, the creature struck.

“Screech—!” Its claws slashed the air, conjuring a black wind blade that sliced through several demons. “Retreat!” one screamed. The others fled, awestruck and terrified.

**In Demon City**
“My lord, I… I failed,” the yellow-haired demon knelt in a bone-carved hall, trembling. “Dismissed,” a cold voice replied. Relieved, he scrambled out.

A black skeletal throne rotated, revealing a red-robed man identical in attire to Guan Yu. A dark skull mask obscured his face as he swirled wine in a goblet. “Chimei,” he murmured before vanishing in a crimson streak.

**Awakening**
Guan Yu stirred, expecting to find herself in a demonic lair. Instead, she lay unharmed, the Soul-Devouring Whip beside her. *Why did they spare me?* Shaking off doubts, she grabbed the whip. “I don’t know why you drank my blood, but you’ll always be my partner.” She guessed half-right—the true savior now dwelled within the weapon.

As she staggered away, the whip flickered faintly. Unnoticed, a black-clad man tailed her under orders: “Monitor her. Do not harm her… yet.”

**Tree Hollow**
Returning to the desolate hollow, Guan Yu trembled with grief. “Alone again,” she laughed bitterly, fists clenched. “Black Serpent Dragon! Master! I *will* avenge you!” Her rage erupted, detonating the surrounding swamp. The hidden observer shielded himself from the blast. “Earth Venerable-level power, yet unleashing Saintly Venerable force? A monster indeed!”

Collapsing to her knees, she wept—then hardened. “I *will* grow stronger. For revenge.” She repeated it like a mantra, wiping tears before meditating to heal. The watcher marveled at her resolve. *Could she survive long enough to become a threat?*

**Days Later**
In Demon City’s throne room, the red-robed lord listened as his agent reported Guan Yu’s recovery. “Convalescing? I underestimated her.” Admiration flickered beneath his mask.

The yellow-haired demon barged in, pleading to retrieve the whip. The lord’s eyes narrowed. “You wish to leave?” Before the fool could finish, a wave of the hand reduced him to ash. “Continue surveillance,” the lord ordered his agent, who vanished obediently.

**Chapter 1551: Humiliation**

**Netherworld**
Akalili, Lord of the Netherworld, paused his work. “Demon Sovereign. Show yourself.” A cloaked figure materialized—Murong Fengyu, Guan Yu’s master.

“Here to chat,冥王 (Nether King)?” Murong Fengyu smirked, removing his mask.

“State your purpose.”

“How does one open the Death Abyss?” Murong’s tone brooked no refusal.

Akalili bristled but dared not fight—Murong, a dual-element Celestial Venerable, outranked him. “Even I cannot open it. Why ask?”

“My disciple is trapped there!”

“A *human* in the Abyss? Preposterous!” Akalili sneered inwardly. Murong left in despair, unaware Akalili had orchestrated Guan Yu’s plight.

**Death Abyss**
Guan Yu glared eastward. “Demon City.” Her voice dripped venom.

**Demonic Realm**
Murong stood before a grave. “Forgive me, Guan Yu. I failed you.”

His companion, Ye Wuhen, scoffed. “Since when was she your disciple? Or… more?”

Murong cuffed him. “Respect your sister-disciple.”

Ye Wuhen yawned. “Whatever. She’s dead anyway.”

**Demon City Gates**
Guan Yu faced a centaur-like demon guarding the entrance. “To enter, defeat me!”

“Just you?” Her bloodlust flared.

The demon swung his blade—but a whip-crack severed him mid-sentence. “You said defeat you,” she coldly remarked, stepping over his corpse into a tunnel of skulls.

A shadow trailed her, impressed. *No fear. This child is extraordinary.*

After an eternity, light beckoned. Guan Yu paused, conflicted. Carrying the Soul-Devouring Whip inside risked bloodshed—yet she refused to stow it. Resolute, she pressed on.

**Chapter 1552: Soul-Devouring Whip**

At the tunnel’s end, Guan Yu faced Demon City’s sprawling darkness. She ignited a flame, revealing walls of bone. Unfazed, she marched toward the distant glow—not hurrying, merely enduring.

Emerging at last, she hesitated. The whip at her waist could ignite chaos, but she wouldn’t conceal it. *So be it.*

A centaur guard blocked the gate. “Human! Challenge me to enter!”

“Defeat you? Done.” Her whip lashed out, bifurcating him before he finished. She stepped through, entering a realm of endless night.

The watcher, hidden, mused: *Ordinary children would’ve fled screaming. But she… what destiny awaits?*
