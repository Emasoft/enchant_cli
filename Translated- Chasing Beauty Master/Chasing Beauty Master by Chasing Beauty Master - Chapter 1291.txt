“Hearing this, Xiao Zhi immediately stood up and said hurriedly, ‘Guan Yu, let me go with you to check. Let’s go.’”

Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi entered another room. The furnishings here were even simpler, with the only notable difference being that the walls were made of stone. It seemed they had ventured deeper into the mountain cave, and the air carried a chill.

The room was empty and small, showing no signs of water. Xiao Zhi groaned, “Alas, there’s no water here. We’ll have to endure the thirst.”

Guan Yu, listening intently, suddenly raised his hand to silence Xiao Zhi. A faint sound reached their ears—the trickle of flowing water.

**Chapter 3,322: The Unthinkable**

“I hear flowing water,” Guan Yu whispered. “It must be over there. Let’s investigate.”

He led the way toward the innermost corner, where a cloth curtain hung from the ceiling, partially obscuring their view. The sound emanated from behind it.

Xiao Zhi cautioned, “Be careful, Guan Yu. I’ll wait here.” Sensing something amiss, he chose to stay back while discreetly gripping his bronze talisman, ready to cast a protective spell if danger arose.

Guan Yu, undeterred, reasoned that the stone walls likely concealed a natural spring. The absence of dust despite the room’s age hinted at habitation. With Yunqing Sect’s elders nearby, he dismissed Xiao Zhi’s caution as excessive.

Pulling aside the curtain, Guan Yu froze. Before him steamed a wooden tub fed by a bamboo channel diverting water from a hot spring crevice. But his gaze locked onto the occupant—a stunning woman bathing in the tub, her snow-white skin glistening.

“You little brat!” The woman’s roar preceded a splash of water to Guan Yu’s face, blinding him momentarily.

“Demon!” Xiao Zhi shouted, unleashing an energy blast that vanished soundlessly into the curtain. As the fabric disintegrated under another explosive force, the woman emerged—dripping waist-length hair framing a face of celestial beauty. Xiao Zhi gaped, transfixed.

**Chapter 3,323: Enough Foolishness**

“How dare you peeping tom fools disturb me!” The woman’s fury crackled in the air.

Master Xuanming hurried in, bowing deeply. “Elder Qing, spare these ignorant disciples!”

“Elder...Qing?” Guan Yu stared at the youthful beauty. This was Yunqing’s revered elder? Her appearance defied expectations—petite frame, flawless features, and skin like polished jade belying centuries of cultivation.

“Explain this intrusion!” Elder Qing snapped, water droplets clinging to her lashes. “Arriving unannounced during my bath!”

Guan Yu protested, “Master, I only sought drinking water! I didn’t know—”

“Silence!” Xuanming cut him off. “Apologize at once!”

“But I barely glimpsed—”

“A glimpse?” Elder Qing’s voice rose. “Shall I disrobe fully for your viewing pleasure?”

Guan Yu paled. “My deepest apologies, Venerable Elder. This lowly disciple overstepped.”

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi—still processing the elder’s divine countenance—blurted, “Witch! How dare you ambush Yunqing disciples!” He brandished his talisman, ignorant of the catastrophe his words invited.

Gasps filled the chamber. Sect Leader Zheng trembled. “Fool! Kneel before Elder Qing!”

“Father jokes,” Xiao Zhi laughed nervously until Zheng’s thunderous glare struck him mute. The reality crystallized—this goddess-like figure commanded power eclipsing all present. With trembling knees, he kowtowed. “This unworthy disciple begs forgiveness! Your celestial beauty blinded my judgment!”

**Chapter 3,324: Unresolved Threads**

Elder Qing’s anger gradually subsided into melancholy. “Where is Elder Jiu?” she asked quietly, tracing the bamboo water channel. “Still avoiding me after all these years?”

The elders exchanged uneasy glances. Xuanming cleared his throat. “We’ve come regarding the Gongde Ding’s empowerment ritual. These four disciples earned the privilege through the Six Peaks Tournament.”

“Four?” Her eyebrow arched. “Tradition permits only one.”

“These exceptional times demand exceptional measures,” Xuanming replied carefully, aware of Guan Yu’s discreet study of the elder. The youth’s mind raced—Elder Qing’s lingering glance toward the mountains suggested centuries-old heartache interwoven with Yunqing’s history. To gain her favor, he realized, one might need to unravel the mystery of her estrangement from Elder Jiu.

As discussions continued, Guan Yu noted how the steaming spring water mirrored Elder Qing’s paradoxical nature—a fiery spirit encased in ageless beauty, her casual posture belying the spiritual pressure that made seasoned cultivators sweat. He filed away every detail: the peculiar care in her hairpin placement, the faint scar on her wrist that even immortal cultivation couldn’t erase, the way her laughter never quite reached her eyes when speaking of the past.

Somewhere beyond the stone walls, a nightingale’s song echoed through the mountain pass—a lonely counterpoint to the tension thickening the chamber.
