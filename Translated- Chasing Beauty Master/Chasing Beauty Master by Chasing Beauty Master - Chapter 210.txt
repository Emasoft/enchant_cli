Chapter 522: Master of Under-the-Table Deals

Yet one minute passed, then two, then three... until five full minutes elapsed without a single student stepping forward.

When Liu Gang dropped his bombshell accusation, only a handful of classmates had briefly averted their eyes. But none spoke up—they weren't fools. Everyone understood the game this newly-appointed dean was playing.

With renewed determination, the students returned to their activities, leaving Liu Gang to perform his solitary farce.

"Fine! Splendid!" Liu Gang's laughter dripped with suppressed rage. "Such admirable loyalty and unity! Since you're all so devoted to protecting the culprit, you'll share the punishment. Ten-thousand-word self-criticism essays from every one of you, due tomorrow. Fail to comply, and I'll ensure you fail Politics class. Worse still—permanent disciplinary marks in your academic records. Think carefully. Those who come forward now will receive leniency. My offer stands."

For art students, failing classes meant little. They could always pay extra fees before graduation to obtain diplomas. But Liu Gang's second threat struck home—a black mark in their official records would haunt job applications. Not all came from wealthy or connected families. Many relied on clean records to secure decent livelihoods after graduation.

The room filled with uneasy glances. Liu Gang's trap snapped shut—career-ending consequences versus betraying a classmate.

Satisfaction bloomed across the dean's bloated face. No one could withstand this pressure forever. Let them play the hero now—the first domino would fall soon.

When a chair finally scraped against the floor, Liu Gang's triumph turned to ash. The rising figure wasn't some timid informant, but Wang Zhen—the very student who'd openly defied him earlier.

Bad blood ran deep between them. Months prior, Liu Gang's son Liu Wei had bullied a student council member, even hiring thugs to attack the boy. As head of the male student department, Wang Zhen led his battle-hardened crew to crush both thugs and Liu Wei himself. The dean's subsequent attempt to expel Wang Zhen failed when the principal protected the student—Liu Wei had violated campus security protocols by bringing outsiders.

Now fate delivered Wang Zhen into Liu Gang's clutches.

"Was it you?" Liu Gang barked, barely containing his glee. This time, expulsion would stick.

Wang Zhen regarded him with withering scorn. "Which eye witnessed my involvement? Stuff your gut with trash if you must, but mind your tongue before lightning strikes."

The dean's face purpled. Mockery of his obesity and veiled threats? From a student? Unthinkable! Yet as an educator, he couldn't retaliate openly.

"Then why stand?" Liu Gang growled through clenched teeth.

"To remind a petty bureaucrat: your new title grants no real power." Wang Zhen's voice cut like winter wind. "Dare abuse authority for personal vendettas? Threaten our futures? You couldn't survive the backlash. Posturing fools always fall—remember that before digging your own grave."

Students straightened in their seats. The bluff called, fear evaporated. Dozens of hostile eyes now pinned the sputtering dean.

"And as your student," Wang Zhen added sweetly, "I must advise: old men should bundle up against cold. Frostbite might... diminish your administrative vigor."

Male students erupted in laughter. The innuendo hung thick—everyone knew Liu Gang's rumored "after-hours tutoring" of female staff.

"You... Wang Zhen! Prime instigator! Expulsion!"

"Evidence?" A new voice sliced through the chaos.

Guan Yu leaned against the doorway, icy amusement in his gaze. "All I smell is cheap perfume and under-the-table deals. Quite the expert, aren't you?"

Chapter 523: Stench of Corruption

Rage upon rage choked Liu Gang. Humiliated by students, now accused of sexual misconduct? True, he'd eyed younger teachers, but his new position hadn't allowed time for such... indulgences.

He whirled to face the interloper—short-cropped hair, chiseled features, mocking smile. Pure contempt radiated from the youth.

"Apologize!" Liu Gang thundered, jowls quivering. "Slanderous lies!"

Guan Yu sniffed theatrically. "Lies? That cloying stench says otherwise. Multiple partners too—your cologne's practically a cocktail."

"Preposterous!" Liu Gang's protest died as his own nostrils flared. Beneath fish market reek from the prank's water bucket... was that... urine? Students burst into fresh guffaws.

"Let's poll the class," Guan Yu suggested.

"Master perfumer!" Wang Zhen chimed in. "Teach us your ways—be a proper educator!"

"Don't forget the piss stench!" shouted Tian Hao from the back, the liquid culprit himself.

Guan Yu's nose wrinkled in realization. Liu Gang's face transitioned from purple to corpse-gray.

"Defamation! Criminal defamation!" The dean seized a chalkboard eraser. "Who are you? How dare—"

The projectile sailed harmlessly past as Guan Yu sidestepped. "Attending class, obviously. Your deductive skills explain the career stagnation."

Liu Gang's vision blurred with rage. Never had a student so flagrantly insulted him. Previous troublemakers were expelled—poor ones without connections. But this... this viper needed extermination.

"Expulsion! Immediate expulsion!"

"Based on what?" Guan Yu advanced, predator-calm. "Your wounded pride? Let me educate you, 'Dean' Liu."

Panic flashed across Liu Gang's face as Guan Yu seized his tie. The silk noose tightened.

"Teachers earn respect. You? Professional blackmailer. Career built on expelling the powerless." With effortless strength, Guan Yu hoisted the squirming dean off his feet. "Time for fieldwork."

The classroom door burst open. Two hundred pounds of corrupt academia sailed through the air, skidding across snowdrifts in a ten-meter belly slide.

As cheers erupted behind him, Guan Yu dusted his hands. Wang Zhen whooped, slapping his back.

"Boss! You haven't lost your touch!"

"Legend! How'd you bag Professor Wen?"

"Save me!" Guan Yu fled the sudden interrogation, laughter trailing behind.

Outside, Liu Gang lay wheezing in his urine-stained suit. Somewhere beneath the snow, his authority dissolved like salt on ice.

Chapter 524: Leave Us a Lifeline

"Y-you... assault!" Liu Gang clawed at his throat, legs pedaling air as Guan Yu held him aloft.

"Expel me? Then this is farewell courtesy."

The dean's polished shoes dangled helplessly. "I'm... educator... unhand..."

"Educator?" Guan Yu's grip tightened. "You're a leech. Stealing futures to climb higher."

With a heave, Liu Gang became a human projectile. The snow-cushioned impact spared his face, but not his dignity. Ten meters of groin-first skid left an indelible yellow trail.

Guan Yu turned to find forty awestruck faces. Wang Zhen's applause broke the silence, soon joined by thunderous cheers.

"Boss Guan's back!"

"Teach us your dating secrets!"

Amid the uproar, Guan Yu caught his friends' eyes and slipped away. Some battles were won, but the war against corruption? That required subtler strategies.

Outside, Liu Gang's muffled curses blended with students' laughter—a symphony of comeuppance. The snow kept falling, burying old grudges, nurturing new hopes.
