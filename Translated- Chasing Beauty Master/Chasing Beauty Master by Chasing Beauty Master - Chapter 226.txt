**Chapter 562: The Exam Begins**

Guan Yu gazed at the translucent glass bottle containing several buzzing flies and nodded in satisfaction.

These flies were twice the size of ordinary ones, their glossy green heads gleaming with a nauseating sheen. He unscrewed the bottle cap, eager to witness their potency.

No sooner had he cracked open a sliver of the lid than a putrid stench assaulted his nostrils, nearly making him retch. He hastily resealed it, now fully convinced these were indeed the “countryside manure-pit specials” Luo Cheng had promised. Even the flies from the outhouse in his own rural village hadn’t reeked this badly. He could only imagine the ordeal Luo Cheng had endured to capture them.

Yet the more repulsive the flies, the more pleased Guan Yu became. Their success in tormenting Liu Gang hinged entirely on these grotesque creatures.

A day of calm passed at the villa.

The next morning, as Guan Yu walked through campus, he sensed an oppressive atmosphere. Such was the nature of exam season—these few days would either be swiftly forgotten or haunt students through the New Year if failed.

His class’s exam was scheduled for 1:30 p.m., but he arrived early to finalize plans with Wang Zhen.

Entering the classroom with Zhao Jinger (Quiet Beauty), he found Wang Zhen and the entire class already waiting.

“Brother Yu, how’s it going?” Wang Zhen rushed forward, grinning. “Our futures here depend on you. Don’t let us down!”

Guan Yu flicked his forehead. “As your leader, would I abandon you? Relax—everything’s arranged. Did you collect everyone’s phone numbers?”

“All here!” Wang Zhen eagerly pulled out a phone. “I preloaded every classmate’s number. Just input the answers and hit send.”

“Impressive forethought.” Guan Yu nodded approvingly before handing Wang Zhen a small vial. “Before the exam, discreetly sprinkle this on Liu Gang. Don’t get caught.”

Wang Zhen squinted at the clear liquid. “What is this?”

Leaning close, Guan Yu whispered an explanation. Wang Zhen’s expression shifted from puzzlement to barely suppressed laughter.

“Don’t mess this up,” Guan Yu warned, flicking his forehead again.

“Genius!” Wang Zhen竖起大拇指. “Where’d you get this? I need some for future use against that bastard Liu!”

“You think this is easy to make?” Guan Yu snorted. “This tiny bottle took ages.”

Noticing Wang Zhen’s covetous glance, he added sternly, “Use it all. Even a drop left ruins the effect.”

Wang Zhen deflated but perked up at the thought of Liu Gang’s impending misery.

Internally, Guan Yu fought laughter. The “magic potion” was mere tap water. This theatrics prevented suspicion—how else to explain winter flies targeting Liu? The “potion” provided plausible deniability.

As final preparations unfolded, Wang Zhen suddenly gestured to the class. In unison, they stood and chorused, “Thank you, Sister Jinger!”

Zhao Jinger flushed crimson, hiding behind Guan Yu. “It’s not like that!”

Her protest ignited knowing chuckles.

Guan Yu shot Wang Zhen a glare, but the instigator had already vanished.

Amidst the camaraderie, one figure stood apart—a girl in the corner watched coldly, fingers tracing her cheek as she muttered, “I never forget those who strike me.”

**Chapter 563: The Traitor**

As class monitor, Wang Zhen oversaw the cheating operation with unanimous support, while Guan Yu orchestrated from the shadows.

Time crawled for the anxious students. Though assembled since 8 a.m., exams wouldn’t start until afternoon. Wang Zhen insisted they remain for “emergency readiness,” leaving them to chat and fidget with phones.

Returning from a covert mission, Wang Zhen flashed Guan Yu a thumbs-up—the “potion” had been deployed on Liu Gang.

Guan Yu checked the classroom’s three security cameras and his watch. At exam start +10 minutes, Zhu Lin (Willow Grove) would disable them per their plan.

Six controlled flies lurked in his pocket, tranquilized by the Pet System. Everything awaited Liu Gang’s arrival.

His smirk faded as a paunchy middle-aged man waddled in—Liu Gang himself, clutching exam papers and a signal jammer.

“How convenient you’re all here,” Liu Gang announced. “The exam’s been moved up. Five minutes to prepare.”

Outcry erupted.

“What about Niu Le? He’s still sleeping!” Wang Zhen protested.

“That truant?” Liu Gang sneered. “I called him earlier. His attitude was… enlightening.”

Wang Zhen paled. Their schedule relied on Zhu Lin hacking cameras at the original time. With exams now imminent, the plan crumbled.

“Begin!” Liu Gang declared, unpacking papers.

As panic spread, Guan Yu coldly observed, “We’ve been betrayed.”

**Chapter 564: Liu Gang’s Dirty Play**

Wang Zhen stood, resolve hardening. “I’ll take the fall. Let me warn Zhu Lin!”

Guan Yu yanked him down. “We find the traitor post-exam. I need you here.”

“But—”

“There’s always a way.” Guan Yu’s calm voice cut through the chaos.

Liu Gang’s triumphant smirk faltered under Guan Yu’s icy glare. The real battle had just begun.
