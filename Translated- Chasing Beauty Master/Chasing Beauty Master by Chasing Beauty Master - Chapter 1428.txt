“I am the proprietor here!” the man said coldly, glaring at the three bizarre-looking individuals. Their animal hide clothing and disheveled hair marked them as troublemakers. The proprietor knew these arrogant ruffians were undoubtedly the source of the disturbance.

“I warn you now—you’ll pay in full for everything you’ve smashed. Not a single coin less! After compensating, take your fight outside. Don’t disrupt my business further,” the proprietor declared icily.

Guanyu raised an eyebrow in surprise. Faced with these odd characters, the proprietor showed no fear and spoke with unyielding authority. Clearly, this was no ordinary man.

Inside, the towering figure clutched his injured right arm, calculating his next move as the two attackers closed in. The proprietor’s timely intervention diverted the trio’s attention, granting him a momentary reprieve. The giant secretly hoped to lure the fight outside—escape routes would multiply in the bustling streets, and his wife could slip away unnoticed.

**Chapter 3715: Repayment**

“Old fart, what the hell are you blabbering about?” Third Brother roared, jabbing a finger at the proprietor. “Can’t you see your lordships are teaching this wretch a lesson? So what if we broke a few lousy tables? We’ll pay double! But today, that bastard humiliated our little brother—he won’t leave here breathing!”

“Payment isn’t enough! No fighting on my premises!” The proprietor strode forward, voice booming. “You’re ruining my business! Leave now, or I’ll summon the authorities. Once they arrive, escape will be impossible.”

Second Brother, marked by his unibrow, snarled, “You shriveled sack of bones! My face got smashed in before I could take revenge, and now you prattle about stopping us? You’re clearly in league with him!”

“Ignore this fool! Let’s finish that bastard first!” The hulking Boss Pan brandished his golden blade, jowls trembling as he charged.

“You’ve brought this upon yourselves!” The proprietor’s threat rang hollow as the brutes ignored him.

Guanyu observed curiously. The proprietor was clearly no cultivator—just an ordinary man. Why risk provoking armed thugs? Did he value his tavern more than his life?

The towering figure suddenly raised a hand. “Wait!”

The combatants paused, bewildered. This was no martial tournament—who called timeouts during blood feuds?

As the rotund boss and lanky third brother hesitated, the leaner man jeered, “What? Finally scared? Grovel through my legs and kowtow to Second Brother, and I might spare your pathetic life!”

“No mercy, Third Brother!” Unibrow protested. “After what he did to me, only his death will satisfy!”

Boss Pan chuckled. “Our softhearted Second Brother turns vicious today! Don’t fret—Big Brother will avenge your shame tenfold.”

Meanwhile, the proprietor barked orders: “You two—ride fast and fetch the authorities! Tell them bandits plague my establishment!” His loud pronouncement sent frightened patrons streaming toward the exits.

“Look what you vermin have done!” The proprietor jabbed an accusatory finger. “You’ll compensate every lost copper of today’s earnings!”

Guanyu marveled at the man’s audacity. These Mountain Ma bandits oozed malice, yet this commoner stood his ground like a general commanding troops.

“Think I care about your filthy coins?” Boss Pan bellowed. “I’m buying out this piss-hole! All irrelevant rats—scram before I paint the walls with your guts!”

His roar triggered a stampede. Within moments, only a dozen patrons remained. Guanyu tugged Wang Xiaorong’s sleeve. “Let’s go. When officials arrive, complications will multiply. We’ve delayed enough already.”

“But the spectacle!” Xiaorong protested, though she followed.

“Halt!” The spiteful child pointed at Guanyu. “Big Brothers! These two bullied me too! They tried stealing our seats—don’t let them escape!”

“Third Brother! Bar the doors!” Boss Pan thundered. “None leave until we’re done!”

The lanky man blurred across the room, slamming the entrance shut. “Try leaving now, worms!”

“Seal us in at your peril!” The proprietor warned. “Authorities approach! Surrender now or—”

The Mountain Ma brothers howled with laughter. “Officials? Imperial guards couldn’t stop us today!” Unibrow leered at Xiaorong’s veiled form. “After settling accounts, maybe we’ll sample your pretty companion...”

**Chapter 3716: Deadly Games**

The giant interjected urgently: “Hear me! When officials arrive, we’ll all suffer. True warriors don’t battle bureaucrats—take this outside!”

Boss Pan sneered. “Think I fear your escape? Let’s dance under the sun then!”

As the brawl prepared to relocate, the proprietor blocked their path. “Compensate my damages first!”

Cold steel kissed his throat as Boss Pan growled, “Grandpa here could buy ten of your hovels!” A hefty gold ingot flashed before the proprietor’s widening eyes. “See this, maggot? More than your lifetime’s earnings!”

The proprietor’s demeanor transformed instantly. “Noble lords! This lowly one spoke rashly! Of course mighty heroes like yourselves—”

“Hah! Gold-touched tongue wags differently!” Boss Pan snatched back the ingot. “But why pay when he’s the culprit?” He pointed at the giant. “Settle with him after we’re done!”

Guanyu stifled a laugh—the bandit chief possessed unexpected humor. But the proprietor’s greed resurged. “I care not for your squabbles! You break it, you pay! Authorities will seize your riches regardless!”

Unibrow spat. “Mountain Ma Four fears no officials! That bastard dies today—even the Emperor’s guard couldn’t save him!”

Guanyu assessed the stalemate. The giant’s injured sword arm hung useless—likely fractured. The spiteful child’s vendetta had spiraled beyond reason. And through it all, the avaricious proprietor kept one eye on Boss Pan’s bulging money pouch, already scheming to split its contents with corrupt officials.

As tensions escalated, Xiaorong’s stomach growled audibly. Guanyu sighed—between delayed journeys, missed meals, and this brewing catastrophe, their mission to Cloudgreen Sect faced mounting complications. But with exits barred and blades drawn, escape now required either violence... or patience.
