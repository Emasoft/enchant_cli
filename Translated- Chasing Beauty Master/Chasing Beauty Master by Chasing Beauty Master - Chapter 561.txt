“Very well, I shall fight!” As Chen Yaocheng uttered these words, he glared venomously at Guan Yu. All his humiliation and distress had coalesced into hatred now directed at the young man. In his mind, were it not for Guan Yu, he would never have been reduced to proving himself against a beast.

Bikacat paid no heed to Chen’s reluctance. The magical feline’s sole focus lay in strategizing how to floor his opponent the instant combat commenced. Unlike his restrained approach against Barren Town villagers, he intended to thoroughly humble this arrogant elder.

“Hehe, old man,” Bikacat taunted before the clash, “You seem rather unwilling to fight me.”

“Cease your prattle, beast,” Chen retorted coldly. “You’re unworthy of conversation.”

The scathing remark momentarily stunned even the quick-witted Bikacat. Recovering swiftly, the cat chuckled, “Well then, since words fail us, let fists decide. But before we begin, allow me to propose a wager.”

“What manner of wager?” Murong Yu interjected, intrigue coloring his voice.

“Simple. If I floor him within three moves, he’ll kowtow thrice to my master while crying ‘Grandfather, I was wrong!’”

“I’ll slaughter you!” Chen roared, trembling with rage. Decades of cultivation barely restrained his murderous impulse.

“Chen Yaocheng, stand down!” Murong Yu barked before addressing Bikacat. “Little stray, I’ll accept your three-move condition. But what if you fail?”

“Then I submit to your mercy,” Bikacat replied without hesitation.

“How bold!” Murong Yu’s eyes narrowed as they shifted toward Guan Yu. “But let’s amend the stakes. Substitute him as the forfeit.”

“You overreach—”

“Agreed!” Guan Yu interrupted Bikacat’s protest. Smiling at his companion, he added, “My life’s in your paws now. Don’t disappoint me.”

Bikacat’s heart swelled. Though Guan Yu often bullied him capriciously, staking his life to enable this confrontation demonstrated profound trust. The weight of responsibility pressed heavier, yet as a divine beast, his mental fortitude transformed anxiety into surging energy.

“How admirable! Rest assured, Guan Yu,” Murong Yu sneered, “Your decisiveness merits a dignified demise.” His chilling laughter raised goosebumps on Guan Yu’s skin, inexplicably conjuring thoughts of Murong Yu’s sister—the gentle beauty Murong Li. That such siblings shared blood troubled him deeply.

“Let reality decide our fates,” Guan Yu declared, locking eyes with Bikacat. “Make this count.”

Shedding his usual nonchalance, Bikacat stepped forward solemnly. “Old man, my master’s life hangs in balance. Blame heaven for what comes next.”

“Impudent whelp!” Chen’s composure shattered. Sword gleaming, he lunged with decades-honed fury.

Bikacat’s agility proved superior. Darting beneath the thrust, he unleashed a thunderous Lion’s Roar technique. Hurricane-force winds erupted, sending Chen scrambling. “Child’s play!” the elder scoffed, dodging the gale.

Ignoring taunts, Bikacat vanished into the tempest. Spectators murmured:

“Fled already?”

“Overestimated himself!”

Guan Yu remained calm. Knowing Bikacat’s penchant for unorthodox tactics, he awaited surprises.

A sudden crackle overhead preceded lightning striking Chen within the whirlwind. The elder’s agonized scream pierced clouds as his robes charred and hair stood electrified.

Murong retainers gaped. Their revered elder now resembled a deranged beggar. Though battered, Chen remained standing—technically fulfilling the wager’s terms.

“One more move!” Murong Yu encouraged nervously, realizing Bikacat’s prowess rivaled Guan Yu’s. “Endure this, Chen Bo!”

“I’ll die standing before disgracing Murong honor!” Chen vowed hoarsely.

“Stubborn fool,” Guan Yu sighed. Wise men knew when to yield.

Bikacat materialized, tail ablaze with prismatic motes—emerald, azure, violet, amber, and faintest white. To initiates, these resembled fireflies. To Guan Yu, they represented ascending magical tiers—the faint amber glow particularly alarming, denoting skills few mortals mastered.

Chen paled, recognizing his fatal miscalculation. Before he could react, Bikacat’s tail lashed. Chromatic projectiles homed in, their beauty belying lethality.

“Illusions!” Murong Yu shouted. “The true strike comes above!”

Chen dropped precipitously... only to discover blood blossoming across his chest. He collapsed, consciousness fading amidst gasps of disbelief.

“Three moves exact!” someone cried.

Murong Yu stared dumbstruck at his fallen retainer. “You murdered him!”

“Merely blood-sealed his arteries,” Bikacat corrected. “He’ll perish in two hours unless treated.”

Verification proved Chen lived. “Why spare him?” Murong Yu demanded.

“Courtesy of his master’s wisdom,” Bikacat nodded at Guan Yu. “Now begone. Next time, I show less mercy.”

As Murong forces retreated, Guan Yu praised Bikacat’s performance before eyeing the chromatic technique. “That move needs a name.”

“Five-Colored Bloom?” Bikacat suggested reluctantly when Guan Yu proposed the flamboyant title.

“Master Guan,” a voice interrupted, “Shall we resume searching for Xiao Wei?”

The unresolved quest beckoned, leaving Bikacat’s newly christened technique glittering in the night like deadly fireworks.
