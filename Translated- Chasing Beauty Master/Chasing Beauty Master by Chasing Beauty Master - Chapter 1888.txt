“Before departing, Prince Zou had informed me that if I encountered any difficulties, I should seek assistance from Young Master Wan Hong (Vast Reach). It appears that even before I approached him, he has already extended his aid. This suggests Prince Zou must have made arrangements with him prior to leaving,” the First Prince remarked.

Whether this was truly the case, Jiang Yuankai could not say. He knew nothing of Guan Yu’s relationship with Prince Zou or its depth.

As for whether Wan Hong’s assistance stemmed from deference to Prince Zou, Jiang Yuankai neither knew nor cared. In any case, he had persuaded the Princess Royal to speak on the First Prince’s behalf before the Emperor—an unprecedented gesture of goodwill toward Wan Hong.

This concession was made solely out of gratitude for Wan Hong saving Jiang Xin’s life. Otherwise, neither Jiang Yuankai nor the Princess Royal, who had always disdained court affairs, would have intervened.

“Perhaps so,” Jiang Yuankai replied. “Your Highness, given your esteemed status, such trivial matters hardly warrant personal thanks. Yet if you find yourself at leisure, you are always welcome to visit our residence.”

With a smile, he added, “After all, we are kin by marriage. As the Princess Royal’s brother, frequent visits would be most fitting.”

“My gratitude, Imperial Son-in-Law. Yet these days, I am drowning in responsibilities—overwhelmed by tasks I cannot manage,” the First Prince said wearily. “His Majesty entrusted me with investigating the Jinyiwei’s breach of the imperial prison to assassinate Lord Cao. But thus far, I’ve made no progress.”

“Oh? How so?” Jiang Yuankai inquired. “I heard the intruders were imposters disguised as Jinyiwei. Are they all strangers with unknown masters?”

“Precisely. They are undoubtedly counterfeit agents, yet these men are trained death warriors. Despite every method—persuasion, threats, even torture—they remain silent. Not a single useful word escapes them,” the First Prince lamented.

Jiang Yuankai nodded gravely. “Then these are men of steel resolve. As death warriors, extracting information will prove arduous. Alternative strategies are needed.”

“I’ve exhausted every conceivable approach. They might as well be mute. I cannot fathom how to break them,” the First Prince sighed.

**Chapter 4962: Seeking Counsel**

“A dire predicament. Whoever trained such warriors is no ordinary foe,” Jiang Yuankai observed. “Moreover, Your Highness must guard against their suicide or rescue attempts.”

“A valid point!” the First Prince agreed.

“If these warriors remain loyal, their master may attempt to retrieve them. Preventing their suicide is paramount—deny them any opportunity.”

“Understood. I almost hope rescuers come. With traps laid around the prison, we could capture them all!”

“Caution is vital,” Jiang Yuankai warned. “If the master knows the prison’s defenses, they may avoid direct confrontation. Expect cunning.”

The First Prince conceded the wisdom in these words, being inexperienced in such matters.

“Imperial Son-in-Law, I wish to consult Young Master Wan Hong. Yet I know not where he resides in the capital. Might you assist?”

“Certainly. I shall send a guide,” Jiang Yuankai offered.

“My profound thanks.”

“A trifling favor, Your Highness.”

Soon, an escort led the First Prince to Guan Yu’s inn. Guan Yu, who had planned to visit the Hongyan Theater, received him unexpectedly.

“Your Highness honors me with this visit. What brings you here?” Guan Yu inquired.

Dispensing formalities, the First Prince replied, “I seek your counsel on a pressing matter.”

Pleased his alias remained undisclosed, Guan Yu nodded. “Speak freely.”

“First, I must thank you for your aid. Regarding the Jinyiwei imposters who attacked Lord Cao in prison—are you aware?”

“The entire capital buzzes with it,” Guan Yu remarked.

“His Majesty ordered me to investigate. I’ve exhausted all methods—the captured warriors withstand even torture. I humbly seek your insight.”

“State your case,” Guan Yu urged, masking irritation. Prince Zou’s prior request compelled his cooperation.

“Lord Cao was guarded by the Emperor’s most trusted sword-bearing sentinels. During their morning shift change—the prison’s most vulnerable moment—Jinyiwei agents entered with forged credentials. Distracting the guards, they strung Lord Cao from a noose.”

“A soldier’s timely intervention saved him. The imposters were surrounded, but many guards fell in the skirmish. Captives revealed they were death warriors, not true Jinyiwei. His Majesty granted me full authority via the Yellow Jacket, yet I remain thwarted. How might we extract their secrets?”

Guan Yu scoffed. “A farce! Only Jinyiwei could penetrate that prison. They knew shift patterns, Lord Cao’s location, and replicated flawless credentials. Minister Qi disowns them? Of course! Would he admit culpability?”

**Chapter 4963: Without Evidence**

The First Prince frowned. “You suspect Minister Qi? Without proof, we cannot act. The captives’ silence paralyzes us.”

“Bypass them. Investigate the Jinyiwei directly. Scour Minister Qi’s domain for flaws. Who else desires Lord Cao dead? Only Minister Qi and the Second Prince’s faction.”

“But to probe Minister Qi without evidence...”

“The Yellow Jacket empowers you! Minister Qi serves the Second Prince—must you fear him?” Guan Yu pressed.

Though uneasy, the First Prince conceded. “If Minister Qi were innocent, he’d investigate the credential leak. His inaction betrays guilt.”

“Precisely! Seize this mandate. Scour the Jinyiwei—none dare oppose the Emperor’s decree. Even failure bears no consequence.”

“Yet haste is critical,” Guan Yu warned. “Were I Minister Qi, I’d already destroy evidence.”

“I shall act as you advise,” the First Prince resolved.

Rising, Guan Yu added gravely, “Your Highness, know this—mercy toward Minister Qi endangers yourself. He is the Second Prince’s blade. Eliminate him first, lest he strike you down.”

The words lingered as the First Prince departed. Toppling Minister Qi would cripple the Second Prince’s power—a vital step toward supremacy. Hesitation spelled doom; ruthlessness promised survival.

**Chapter 4964: Swift Betrayal**

Minister Qi, sleepless with dread, sought the Second Prince.

“Your Highness, the Emperor assigned the investigation to the First Prince! If he discovers anything, I am doomed!”

“Useless fool!” the Second Prince spat. “Your Jinyiwei bungled a simple kill! How could imperial guards best them?”

Minister Qi seethed inwardly. Even a dog deserved scraps, yet here he received only scorn. The alliance’s fractures widened.
