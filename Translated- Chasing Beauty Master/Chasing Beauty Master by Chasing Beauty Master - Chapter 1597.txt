Now one was already dead, another had lost combat capability, leaving three opponents. Du Teng came to assist Guan Yu. Two against three had become much easier.

Guan Yu said, “We don’t wish to annihilate you all, but you sought to kill us first. If any of you still wish to live, withdraw now.”

The three opponents remained defiant toward Guan Yu and Du Teng. Earlier, their companions had caused trouble using spells, hence the situation. They considered targeting the two women first but found no opportunity.

The three opponents acted like puppets, ignoring Guan Yu’s words. Zhenxiang prepared to cast spells from behind to aid Guan Yu and Du Teng, but Wang Xiaorong stopped her: “They can handle it from here. Let’s conserve our strength. Save your spiritual energy—it might be needed for greater challenges.”

Zhenxiang nodded. True enough, Guan Yu wielded his Soul-Severing Blade with sweeping strikes, driving his opponents back step by step. He seemed even more formidable now than during his earlier spar with Du Teng.

After a few exchanges, Guan Yu felled another foe. Du Teng also defeated one, leaving the last man to flee in terror back into Swordless Villa—perhaps to call reinforcements or report the incident.

Guan Yu adjusted his stance and turned calmly. “Xiaorong, I was worried about you earlier. Thankfully, you remembered to use it at the critical moment.”

“Yes, the situation was dire. I had no time to cast spells, so I resorted to this,” Wang Xiaorong replied with a smile.

Zhenxiang regarded her with admiration. “Xiaorong, the spell you used earlier was strange. I noticed you didn’t use a magical tool. Is *this* your artifact?” She pointed to the hand crossbow.

“This serves as my magical crossbow,” Wang Xiaorong said. “To be honest, I’ve trained in spellcraft since childhood.”

“Impressive! So your elders are masters of magic?”

Wang Xiaorong nodded but said no more. Disclosing her identity as the Young Master of the Demon Soul Sect to a disciple of True Yang Sect seemed unwise.

Though curious about the spell, Zhenxiang refrained from pressing further.

“What now? Do we proceed inside?” Du Teng asked.

Guan Yu replied, “Let’s enter together and see what tricks they have left. With luck, we might meet the Swordless Immortal. If we encounter resistance we cannot overcome, we retreat. Stay vigilant.”

“Agreed,” Du Teng said, scratching his head. “Since we’re here, let’s explore. Consider it an adventure. Both of you, stay cautious.”

As he stowed his greatsword, he added, “That fleeing man—who knows if he’s raising an alarm.”

“Likely reporting to the Swordless Immortal,” Wang Xiaorong speculated. “We’ve fought here long enough. If reinforcements were coming, they’d have arrived. Since none emerged, perhaps we’ve passed this trial.”

“Probably,” Guan Yu said, gazing inward. “Let’s move.”

***

Upon entering Swordless Villa, the group encountered an anomaly. Past a bend, they expected typical villa grounds but instead found a sprawling peach blossom grove.

The grove stretched far, with buildings visible beyond. Multiple paths branched ahead, leaving Guan Yu uncertain which to take.

“Trouble,” Du Teng said. “This is a maze formation. Straying blindly will trap us. Stay put.”

Guan Yu recognized it too. To proceed, they needed to decipher the formation.

“The servants must know the safe route,” Wang Xiaorong suggested, pointing outside. “Fetch the one Du injured earlier. They can guide us.”

“Brilliant! Why didn’t I think of that?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Wait here. I’ll retrieve him.”

“I’ll help,” Wang Xiaorong said, unwilling to part from Guan Yu. Hand in hand, they exited.

Outside, Guan Yu frowned. The gravely wounded man had vanished—along with the dead servant Wang Xiaorong had shot.

The area showed no traces of battle, not even bloodstains. In mere moments, the scene had reset unnervingly.

Bodies might be moved, but the vanished blood defied logic. Guan Yu felt uneasy. How had everything restored so swiftly?

**Chapter 4142: Trap (Part 1)**

“Where are they?” Wang Xiaorong stared at the empty grounds. A missing corpse was strange enough, but even bloodstains had disappeared. Had someone from inside retrieved them unseen? Yet no one had passed the sole exit.

“Even the blood is gone,” Guan Yu muttered.

A creeping dread gripped him—the fear of the inexplicable. Such unease hadn’t touched him in years.

Wang Xiaorong’s eyes lit up. “I realize now—we’re trapped in an illusionary realm. Look!”

She pointed behind them. Guan Yu turned, stunned. The villa’s gate, which he’d destroyed earlier, now stood intact. The entire surroundings mirrored their initial arrival, as if nothing had occurred.

Only Du Teng and Zhenxiang were missing. Guan Yu shouted, “Brother Du! Are you there?”

No reply came. The silence suggested they’d entered a separate space, isolating the two groups.

Wang Xiaorong clutched his arm. “Guan Yu, where are we? Let’s leave. This place frightens me.”

“Stay calm. I’m here,” he reassured her. “You’re right—this is no ordinary maze. We’re in an alternate dimension.”

“What do we do? Could Brother Du be in danger?”

Guan Yu pondered. When had they entered this illusion? Perhaps arrival itself had trapped them. Without finding an exit, they’d remain lost.

The peach grove inside had clearly been a maze formation. Guan Yu speculated that defeating the villa’s guards properly might have granted safe passage.

Now trapped, he refused to yield. Every illusion had a weakness.

Seeing Wang Xiaorong’s fear, he said, “Returning here may have triggered this realm. Stay alert—traps likely await.”

She nodded. “Aunt Right once told Father of an illusionary realm that trapped her for ages. Here, the impossible becomes possible. This isn’t reality.”

Guan Yu agreed. The eerie stillness hinted at hidden dangers. Illusionary realms differed from maze formations—the former manipulated perception through energy, creating false realities. Escaping required either overwhelming power or locating the realm’s flaw.

“We’re definitely in an illusion. We must find the exit swiftly,” Guan Yu said.

“But how? I can’t distinguish illusion from reality.”

“Recall our arrival—the high winds from this elevation? Now there’s no wind, no scent of trees. This silence isn’t natural.”

Wang Xiaorong tensed. “What do we do?”

Guan Yu eyed the villa’s gate. “Retreating won’t work. Our only path is forward—through the villa again.”

“But what if it’s dangerous? If Brother Du and Zhenxiang aren’t here, they’re still in the real world, right?”

**Chapter 4143: Trap (Part 2)**

“Yes. Let’s hope they don’t wander into this realm searching for us,” Guan Yu said grimly.

“Wait here. I’ll test the gate.” He approached the sealed entrance, considering scaling the wall.

“Be careful of traps,” Wang Xiaorong urged.

The gate mirrored its original state, as if Guan Yu had never shattered it. He vaulted onto the wall—and froze.

“What’s inside?” Wang Xiaorong called.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Nothing. Just a bottomless abyss.” Peering over, he saw sheer cliffs plunging into void. Though an illusion, the drop felt perilously real.

Retreating, he said, “We must seek the exit here. The platform seems barren, but…”

Wang Xiaorong suggested, “What if we retrace our steps? The exit might be obvious.”

“Unlikely, but worth checking.” Gripping her hand, he warned, “Don’t let go. Traps could strike anywhere.”

They descended the stairs, but Guan Yu halted. “The steps were steeper before. These feel altered.”

As they turned back, Wang Xiaorong noticed a vibrant red flower on a tree. “How beautiful!” She reached for it.

“Don’t touch that!” Guan Yu shouted—
