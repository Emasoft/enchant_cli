Guan Yu nodded. “If you have matters to attend to, you should go. I won’t keep you.” With that, Second Only to Wolf turned and left. Watching his gloomy retreating figure, Guan Yu felt quite pleased.

Having such a supreme expert as an ally was truly fortunate—many problems could now be resolved with ease. Just then, the sound of an ambulance echoed outside. It was likely summoned by Jia Bo earlier. Once the ambulance arrived and took Fang Su to the hospital, this matter would be settled.

Guan Yu picked up his phone and dialed a number. The recipient answered with a languid voice: “Guan Yu? What do you want?”

“Miss Fang, I’m honored you still remember my number,” Guan Yu teased deliberately.

**Chapter 2554: Rudeness**

Fang Ding, who was currently accompanying her ailing father, replied irritably, “Guan Yu, spit it out or hang up. Don’t disturb me if it’s nothing.”

“It’s definitely something,” Guan Yu said solemnly. “Fang Su came to my place tonight with over fifty men, demanding the five million back. But that money was your compensation to me—how could I return it? We fought, and now Fang Su is lying unconscious on the ground.”

“What? What did you do to my brother?” Fang Ding exclaimed in shock and fury.

“Don’t panic, Miss Fang. Your brother isn’t seriously hurt, though he’ll likely need to stay in the hospital for a while. This is the consequence of provoking me,” Guan Yu replied.

Fang Ding snapped, “If anything happens to my brother, I’ll make you pay!”

Guan Yu reminded her, “Relax. I’ve already called an ambulance for him. I’m informing you so you can prepare the money for his surgery. Delay any longer, and it might be too late.”

Though Guan Yu meant this as a kindness, Fang Ding showed no gratitude. Well, he never sought recognition for his good deeds anyway.

Fang Su deserved his fate. Xue Jing’s kick to his face had disfigured him—a fitting punishment. After hanging up, Fang Ding hurriedly gathered her things to visit her brother at the hospital.

As she packed, she muttered, “I warned him not to provoke Guan Yu, but he wouldn’t listen. Now he’s been sent to the hospital. Who knows how badly he’s injured? Serves him right.” Her heart churned with anger, worry, and pity.

After settling matters, Guan Yu took Xue Jing back to Qiaoyuan District. By the time Fang Ding reached the hospital, Fang Su had already been wheeled into surgery. Anxiety gnawed at her.

Uncertain of Fang Su’s condition, she grew impatient and resolved to confront Guan Yu. “What exactly did you do to my brother?”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu was in his bedroom, engaged in vigorous “exercise” with Amei and Sakurako. His phone rang at a critical moment. Seeing Fang Ding’s number, he paused reluctantly. “Miss Fang, do you know how rude it is to call so late?” he asked irritably.

Amei lay nearly exhausted on the bed, while Sakurako fared better. Guan Yu continued moving gently as he spoke.

“Guan Yu, you bastard! My brother’s still in surgery—what did you do to him?” Fang Ding roared.

Now understanding the reason for her call, Guan Yu chuckled. “Your brother’s condition isn’t my concern. I didn’t lay a hand on him—he brought this on himself. If he’s been in surgery this long, they’re probably reconstructing his face. You’d better memorize his current appearance. Post-surgery, he might become unrecognizable. Hahaha…”

Avoiding a direct answer, Guan Yu provoked her further. Fang Ding hissed, “I’ll call the police! Do you think assaulting someone makes you right?”

“Go ahead,” Guan Yu retorted indifferently. “But remember: Fang Su hired fifty-plus illegal cultivators from dark organizations to attack me. If the police get involved, who do you think they’ll side with?”

“You—” Fang Ding choked on her words. She knew Guan Yu was right. Fang Su had initiated the conflict. Involving the authorities risked exposing his ties to the underworld, endangering the entire Fang family.

After consideration, she abandoned the idea. Guan Yu’s severe retaliation could easily be framed as self-defense. Fang Su’s prior aggression made legal recourse unwise.

“Don’t worry, Miss Fang. He’s only disfigured. This surgery might help him reform and start anew,” Guan Yu added mockingly.

Fang Ding hung up without another word. Arguing further was futile—she’d await her brother’s emergence from surgery.

Guan Yu claimed Fang Su only lost his looks, implying no mortal danger. If he survived, she’d urge him never to oppose Guan Yu again.

While tending to her ailing father, Fang Ding had researched Guan Yu. Her findings shocked her—the Fang family stood no chance against him. Guan Yu’s power dwarfed theirs entirely.

Had they known his true status earlier, the Fangs would never have antagonized him. The feud began when Fang Su’s pursuit of Lin Qiaoqiao was thwarted by Guan Yu. Seeking revenge, Fang Su ordered steward Gao Bing to undermine the Yu Gang covertly.

Matters escalated until reaching this dire point.

Recently, treasure map rumors had engulfed China, drawing outsiders to City A for opportunistic gains. The martial world stirred tumultuously. Under mysterious manipulation, most focused on the Yang Family and Qiaoyuan District—a troubling trend.

The Yang Family’s intervention temporarily eased tensions as they investigated the mastermind.

**Chapter 2555: Scenery**

Guan Yu suspected the Bill Family’s involvement, with the Feng Family colluding. Fortunately, the Yangs’ efforts calmed the martial community.

Two treasure map fragments had surfaced: one auctioned by the Fengs, the other lost with the vanished Yingshangu.

Under the Bills’ protection, few dared confront the Fengs openly. However, alliances formed to target them covertly. Whispers circulated of exorbitant offers for map fragments.

The high prices tempted many to risk their lives. For ordinary martial artists, acquiring a fragment meant sudden wealth.

Though assembling the full map promised legendary riches, even a single fragment now commanded staggering sums.

Two days later, the martial world split: some sought Yingshangu, others gambled on the Fengs. Many hesitated, wary of the Fengs’ strength and the Bills’ backing.

Yet greed overrode caution. Raiding the Fengs could transform ordinary fighters into the wealthy.

Second Only to Wolf quietly hunted Yingshangu, but her caution thwarted all searches. Guan Yu deduced she remained in City A, monitoring the treasure hunt while recovering.

He deployed his own agents to track her.

One evening, Guan Yu drove aimlessly with Xue Jing. He’d arranged to meet Second Only to Wolf, who insisted on a new location—the old Ran Family estate in the eastern industrial zone.

The area, sparse in residences and traffic, seemed an odd choice. Following directions, Guan Yu leisurely drove with Xue Jing, enjoying the rare peaceful moment.

Xue Jing’s laughter bubbled as she relished their carefree time. Secretly, she wished Guan Yu’s lost cultivation would never return, allowing her eternal guardianship.

To her, staying by his side was happiness enough.

Arriving at the designated spot—a narrow alley beside a thick willow tree—they found it deserted. Second Only to Wolf hadn’t arrived.

“Why did he choose this place?” Xue Jing asked nervously, clinging to Guan Yu’s arm. “It’s dark and empty—creepy.”

Though a skilled cultivator, her feminine fears surfaced. Guan Yu patted her hand. “Don’t worry. I’m here. The air’s polluted here—probably factories nearby.”

The willow’s east side held a dead-end alley; to the south lay overgrown vacant land with withered trees. The stifling summer night carried faint chemical odors.

“There must be chemical or steel plants nearby. Why meet here?” Xue Jing wondered.

“He has his reasons,” Guan Yu replied, suspecting Yingshangu’s trail.

“Who’s there?” Xue Jing suddenly tensed, spotting a figure—Second Only to Wolf.

“Impressive perception, Miss Xue,” he praised, emerging. “No wonder Guan Yu keeps you close.”

Guan Yu hadn’t detected him. Xue Jing’s vigilance, born of protective instinct, had noted his approach.

“You’re early,” Second Only to Wolf remarked. “Notice anything unusual here?”

“Yingshangu’s nearby, isn’t she?” Guan Yu deduced.

“Correct.”

Guan Yu elaborated, “Summer nights should swarm with mosquitoes, especially near overgrowth. Yet there are none. No insect sounds either. The weeds appear chemically withered, but no one would spray here. Poison likely killed them—and the pests. Yingshangu’s venomous pets cleared the area. She’s using factory emissions to mask her presence.”

Second Only to Wolf nodded. “I found a venomous centipede here. With the city hunting her, she’s exploiting industrial stench to hide. She’s nearby, but searching this industrial zone is challenging.”

“We mustn’t alert her,” Guan Yu cautioned.

“That’s why I sought your help,” Second Only to Wolf said. “My men lack the skill. With your aid, we’ll find and eliminate her.”

**Chapter 2556: Devoured**

Second Only to Wolf continued, “The entire area’s insects have been devoured by her poisons. Those dead weeds? Toxins killed them. She’s erased all traces of life here to avoid detection.”

Guan Yu surveyed the silent, lifeless field. “Then let’s begin. She won’t escape tonight.”
