As Guan Yu drew closer and saw the situation ahead, he gasped sharply. Before them stood what appeared to be an enormous bear—colossal beyond imagination.

A massive earth-gray bear, larger than any elephant, wielded mystical arts. Encircling it were members of the True Sun Sect, locked in a battle of attrition. Whether they had provoked the beast or been ambushed remained unclear.

Chapter 4612: The Giant Grizzly

Despite the True Sun disciples bombarding the colossal creature with spells, their attacks proved as ineffective as scratching an itch.

The bear's own sorcery, however, stunned onlookers. With a thunderous stomp of its front paw, an invisible shockwave rippled across the ground.

The circular energy wave spread outward, and suddenly the True Sun disciples moved as if trapped in molasses—their spell incantations slowed to a crawl.

Every human within range became ensnared in this temporal quagmire, their movements dragged into lethargy. The bear, conversely, gained alarming speed.

“Incredible,” Guan Yu murmured, observing from a distance. “A spell-wielding grizzly of this magnitude... The True Sun Sect faces grave trouble.”

His words proved prophetic. The slowed disciples became easy prey. With a single swipe, the bear sent one flying like a bullet—the victim crashing into a distant tree with bone-shattering force. A backward kick dispatched another.

When the deceleration spell abruptly lifted, the bear's movements normalized. Yet it attempted the same tactic again, disregarding incoming attacks.

“Fall back!” shouted an elder of the True Sun Sect. “Retreat ten paces! Engage with ranged spells!”

The shrewd commander had discerned the bear's gravity-based magic only affected a ten-meter radius. By withdrawing beyond this range, his disciples nullified the temporal distortion.

Though the bear’s spell now found no targets, it persisted—not for offense, but to enhance its own mobility. As the humans withdrew, the cunning beast seized its chance to flee.

“Regroup,” the elder urged shaken disciples. “This accursed forest breeds monsters where even trees loom threateningly.”

Emerging from cover, Guan Yu approached with raised hands. “Friends of the True Sun! What quarrel sparked this ursine confrontation? Truly, that beast could chill the boldest heart.”

“Cloud Azure Sect?” The elder squinted, recognizing their borrowed Crimson Heretic Sect robes. After explanations, alliances formed—twenty strong now marched together through the mist-veiled wilderness.

“We’ve seen neither hide nor hair of our comrades since entering,” the elder fretted. “This ‘Miao Realm’ sprawls like its own continent.”

Guan Yu nodded. “The riddles point to ‘Divine Stone Mountain beneath Golden City.’ Yet where...”

Their discourse halted as ghostly buildings materialized ahead—concrete structures mirroring earthly architecture but inhabited by shape-shifting horrors.

Wang Jun wandered this uncanny replica of home, accosting pedestrians who transformed into frog-headed monsters when pressed. A child’s extending tongue sent him sprawling.

“Demonic city!” he gasped, fleeing through streets empty save for phantoms. Though mountains ringed the horizon, locating the mythical Divine Stone Peak seemed hopeless alone.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s expanded party encountered rival sects but avoided conflict. “None know the Eight-Sided Drum Art’s location,” he observed. “We all grope blindly.”

As they pressed onward, the true scale of their challenge unfolded—a realm where reality itself seemed malleable, and every shadow hid teeth or treachery.
