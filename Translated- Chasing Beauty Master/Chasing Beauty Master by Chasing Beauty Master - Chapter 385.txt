The younger brother touched his swollen cheek and lowered his head.

Huang Zhongxing's expression softened slightly before he turned to the other three men. "Proceed as planned. Take the target out and dispose of her in a remote area. As for the woman with her..." He snorted coldly. "She simply had the misfortune of being with Li Xi today. Take them both. Understood?"

"Understood!"

"If unexpected situations arise, fire a few shots into the crowd. With this many people, a couple of deaths won't matter. Our priority is creating chaos to escape. Clear?"

"Clear!"

"Move out!"

Huang barked sharply. The five men instantly dispersed into the bustling crowd, hands buried in pockets concealing their weapons. Though scattering in different directions, their destination remained unified—the café where Li Xi sat.

Meanwhile, Li Xi slumped exhausted in her chair, massaging sore shoulders amidst a mountain of shopping bags. "You bought everything you liked and disliked," she complained. "Might as well have purchased the entire store."

Lin Lin stared at her wide-eyed.

"What?" Li Xi frowned.

"Xi Xi, you've changed!" Lin Lin exclaimed, her voice rising.

Li Xi fell silent.

Lin Lin grabbed her hand excitedly, as if discovering treasure. "You feel different now—like an immortal descending to earth, yet carrying mortal warmth!"

Li Xi tapped Lin Lin's forehead reproachfully. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Giggle! I like this change! Before, you were an untouchable goddess. Now you're becoming a real woman—learning to complain! The old you never tired no matter how long we shopped."

Li Xi's silence returned.

She couldn't deny the truth. This transformation undoubtedly stemmed from Guan Yu's infuriating influence. Prolonged exposure to him had subtly reshaped her personality. Was this progress? Uncertainty brewed restless irritation in her heart.

"Who are you daydreaming about?" Lin Lin waved hands before Li Xi's face teasingly.

Emerging from her thoughts, Li Xi smiled faintly but remained mute.

Lin Lin leaned closer conspiratorially. "Thinking of Guan Yu? Did he change you? Has our goddess finally fallen from her icy throne into love's river?"

Li Xi answered multiple probing questions with continued silence. Matters of the heart defied explanation—best understood through wordless comprehension.

"Giggle! If you miss him, call him!" Lin Lin pulled out her phone, scrolling contacts. "Hope he hasn't changed numbers. If he did, I'll skin him alive!"

"Oh! It's ringing! Heaven denies me this cougar's chance!" Lin Lin alternated between delight and complaint.

Li Xi sighed. Lin Lin's tongue could conjure drama from thin air.

"Stop this!"

Li Xi snatched for the phone, but Lin Lin reacted faster. The device slipped through their fingers, clattering to the floor.

"You're being ridiculous!" Lin Lin bent to retrieve it.

A man suddenly appeared beside Li Xi. "If I were you," he murmured, pressing cold steel against her ribs, "you'd focus on me now."

"Who are you?!" Lin Lin demanded, oblivious. Li Xi recognized the gun's metallic chill.

"What do you want?" Li Xi raised her voice deliberately, eyeing the still-connected phone. "This is International Trade Plaza. You can't escape."

The man smirked. "Escape? With you as ticket, we'll walk out easily. Worry about yourself."

"Who sent you?"

"You'll know... later." He waved the weapon. "Behave, and this stays civil."

Resistance proved futile against armed professionals. Exiting the café, Li Xi noted approaching thugs with telltale bulges at their waists—no ordinary street rats.

"Boss, easier than expected!"

These were Huang Zhongxing's men from the Hao Clan.

"Stay alert until it's done!" Huang warned sternly. Though successful, this mission held his life in balance. Scanning the oblivious crowd, he gestured sharply. "Move!"

At the Li family villa, Guan Yu's face darkened as he hung up. Activating his gravity system, he materialized at the abandoned café—finding only Li Xi's glowing phone.

"Bastards dare touch my woman!" Venom laced his whisper. Only the Hao Clan would retaliate for his casino winnings. Their targeting Li Xi instead of him directly ignited volcanic rage.

"Confirmed?"

Lin Dong showed surveillance footage: Li Xi calmly following Huang's crew into a black Jeep.

"Need me to...?"

"Eliminate Li Yu's old hound."

After Lin Dong departed, Guan Yu cold-dialed Jiang Ziqi. "Seeking early grave, Jiang?"

"What madness—"

"Your scheming games? If not for your usefulness..." Guan Yu's voice dropped arctic. "Li Xi's kidnapped. Hao Clan's work. Find her location."

Jiang Ziqi's throat tightened. His ploy to pit Hao Clan against Guan Yu had backfired spectacularly. "Just locate her?"

"Fail this simple task..." The line went dead.

On the highway, two Jeeps sped toward the city outskirts. Blindfolded Li Xi maintained composure despite anxiety.

The driver licked his lips, eyeing her through the rearview. "Boss, how we handling this piece?"

Huang smacked his head. "Touch her and I dump your corpse roadside!"

A ringing phone interrupted. Huang answered obsequiously: "Done, boss!"

Li Yu's voice crackled: "Bring her to headquarters alive."

As the Jeeps U-turned, Li Xi broke silence: "You're Hao Clan."

Huang started. "How—"

"Only your kind lacks brains to kidnap me."

"Shut it!" Huang leaned close, reeking of tobacco. "Play nice or I redecorate that pretty face—"

The Jeep screeched violently, Huang's skull cracking against metal.

"Fool! Can't you—" The driver pointed trembling ahead.

Through windshield, a figure stood calmly mid-highway.

"Fucking hell..." Huang paled. "Guan Yu!"
