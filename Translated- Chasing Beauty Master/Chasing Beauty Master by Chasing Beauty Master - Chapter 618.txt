As she gazed upon the colossal spider, battle fervor surged within her. A Sovereign Supreme-level magical beast – she'd never crossed blades with such a creature before! Today presented the perfect opportunity. With a whip-crack that split the air, her Soul-Devouring Whip lashed towards the arachnid. The creature scuttled aside with surprising agility, the whip's barbed tip gouging deep scars into the stone floor. Sensing Guan Yu's assault, the spider ceased hesitation, immediately spewing thick webs towards her.

"Let's test your craftsmanship," Guan Yu murmured, eyeing the descending mesh. Her whip sang upward, shredding the sticky net into worthless filaments. "Never fails in a pinch," she thought grimly. Enraged by its ruined trap, the spider launched volley after volley of webbing while frenzied vampire bats drove Hu Xiaohai towards the stone bridge's midpoint. Their predicament resembled meat filling in a monstrous sandwich.

Panic clawed at Guan Yu's throat. To perish here, unfinished vengeance burning in her heart? Unthinkable! As twin assaults converged from both flanks, she summoned swirling winds to cocoon herself. Snatching Hu Xiaohai mid-leap, she lashed her whip around the bridge's parapet, dangling precariously beneath the stone arch as attacks collided above.

Peering into the bottomless chasm below and the prowling beasts above, Guan Yu held her breath. The spider's heightened senses soon detected their presence. With simultaneous roars, both monsters attacked the dangling pair. "No escape without ending this," Guan Yu realized, steeling herself.

Hu Xiaohai launched at the vampire bats while Guan Yu faced the arachnid colossus. "Its venom means instant death," she recalled, "yet these bats endure. Unnatural resilience for mere beasts." The spider's mandibles clacked rhythmically, spewing acid-laced webs that dissolved stone where they landed. Guan Yu's whip became a silver blur, deflecting each corrosive projectile.

"Think me some helpless kitten?" Guan Yu snarled as fury overrode caution. Elemental attacks erupted in rapid succession – earthen spikes, metallic shards, razor winds – driving the spider back in alarm. The creature steadied itself, calculating: A tri-elementalist, yet unrefined. Manageable, if barely.

Meanwhile, Hu Xiaohai danced between the vampire bat's talons and wind blades. Though his毒 (poison) ravaged the creature, its stubborn vitality defied reason. "Persistent cockroach!" the bat screeched, unleashing supersonic waves that shook the cavern. The stone bridge trembled, chunks plummeting into the abyss.

Guan Yu's whip cracked against falling debris as wind currents buoyed her upward. Hu Xiaohai, momentarily stunned, found himself ensnared in webbing. Flames erupted from his paws, reducing the sticky prison to ash. Reunited, the pair faced their adversaries across the crumbling bridge.

The spider's multifaceted eyes blazed with murderous intent. United now against the interlopers, both beasts attacked in concert. Guan Yu feinted towards the spider, baiting twin wind blades from the bat. At the last instant, she recalled Hu Xiaohai into the whip and sidestepped, letting the attacks collide. The resulting shockwave propelled her past the spider's defenses.

Hu Xiaohai materialized beneath the startled arachnid, claws flashing. Multiple legs severed, the crippled beast collapsed. The poisoned bat, wings faltering, gathered its remaining strength for final sonic assault. The cavern quaked, stone raining down as Guan Yu sprinted through flame-encircled corridors.

Emerging into daylight, she glanced back at the collapsed tunnel. "Nearly became permanent decor," she breathed. The journey onward revealed worse – serpentine walls undulating with scaled bodies. Hu Xiaohai's voice echoed in her mind: "Fool! They sense kindred spirit in you."

Navigating the living carpet of snakes, Guan Yu reached a shimmering azure barrier. Her hand passed through effortlessly – a prison meant for demons, not humans. Beyond lay molten rivers where a draconic shape stirred in the magma.

"Merely diluted lineage," Hu Xiaohai scoffed as the lava-born wyrm emerged. Guan Yu's grip tightened on her whip. This ancient creature's obsidian scales drank in the hellish glow, eyes burning like captured suns. Survival now depended on wits, not strength – her depleted reserves couldn't sustain another battle. The true trial had only begun.
