However, many people at that time believed that the golden shimmer of the nearby sands was caused by the appearance of Miao City. In truth, this was not the case—it was related to sunlight. Only when such conditions were met would Miao City manifest.

If these conditions were not fulfilled, Miao City would certainly not appear. Hearing Guan Yu’s explanation, Xiaomei grew worried. This season was prone to rain, and light drizzles could persist for days without cease.

Xiaomei asked, “If it rains, will Miao City fail to appear? Would all our efforts be in vain?”

“Not just ours—*everyone’s* efforts would be wasted. It would be as if the heavens played a colossal joke on the entire martial world,” Guan Yu replied with a bitter smile. “Let’s hope the weather clears swiftly and the rain holds off.”

Xiaomei remained uneasy. Oppressively humid days devoid of wind often heralded heavy rain, and the likelihood was high.

“We’ll have to wait and see,” Guan Yu said. “There’s nothing else we can do for now. Everyone should rest and conserve their energy.”

In truth, Guan Yu suspected he wasn’t the only one who had noticed this. Surely the Demon Soul Sect had also discerned the problem. Yet they remained here, waiting. There was no reason to lose heart—he could only pray the rain would stay away, or that his assumptions were mistaken.

Inside the tent, Guan Yu lay awake while Siqi slept soundly beside him, her soft breaths signaling exhaustion from their journey and her previous sleepless night. Guan Yu chose not to disturb her, letting her rest as he imagined the form Miao City might take.

A city of the demon realm—what would it look like? Would its inhabitants, all demonic beings, live in human guise or their true forms? With so many animal varieties, how did they communicate? Such questions occupied his mind. He envisioned a dilapidated settlement, devoid of proper structures or dwellings.

“Senior brother, look—there are people ahead,” a youthful voice called outside.

The camp had been quiet, so the voices roused Guan Yu’s vigilance. Not wanting to wake Siqi, he slipped out silently.

A group of about twenty approached—the smallest contingent he’d encountered so far, far fewer than the dozens or hundreds typical of other factions. They were unfamiliar, neither from the Demon Soul Sect nor the Crimson Lotus Sect.

“Might I ask if Miao City lies nearby?” one of them inquired directly, catching Guan Yu off guard.

**Chapter 4601: Reputation in Ruins**

Guan Yu studied the group. “Who are you?” he countered.

“We are wanderers of the martial world, journeying through the desert in search of Miao City,” the man answered calmly. Though polite, their origins remained ambiguous.

“If you’ve come this far, you must have guides. Why ask me?” Guan Yu pressed.

An elderly man stepped forward, weathered by travel yet dignified. “Young hero, we followed certain signs and directions. If you’d rather not answer, why engage in banter?”

Guan Yu frowned—the retort, though courteous, had deftly cornered him. “Then tread quietly. My companions are resting,” he said, stepping aside but keeping watch. If they attacked, his Desert Eagle pistol was ready, though Siqi’s crossbow lay elsewhere.

The group nodded and moved past without another word. Intrigued, Guan Yu muttered aloud, “I may not be of the martial world, but I know its affairs. I recognize the Demon Soul Sect, Cloud Azure Sect, Crimson Lotus Sect, and even the obscure High Mountain Sect. Yet your faction eludes me—are you lesser-known than even them?”

Suddenly, a realization struck him: the Zhenyang Sect. He’d only met one member—Da De’s wife—but their presence in the desert seemed likely. These travelers’ subdued demeanor matched the Zhenyang Sect’s reputation for discretion.

“Reputation is but hearsay,” the elder remarked dismissively as they walked. “What use is it?”

Guan Yu, undeterred, pressed further. “The Zhenyang Sect should halt here. The Demon Soul Sect lies ahead—your numbers are too few to confront them.”

The elder paused. “You claim to be no martial artist, yet your insight suggests otherwise. Are there truly many Demon Soul Sect members ahead?”

“Would I deceive you? Send scouts to verify. Why risk annihilation?”

“Our identity?” The elder feigned ignorance. “Why would the Demon Soul Sect care about mere travelers?”

*Damn it!* Guan Yu seethed inwardly. *This old fox is a master of pretense.* Aloud, he scoffed, “Your secrets mean nothing to me. Do as you will.”

“We are but a minor sect,” the elder said. “Your warning is appreciated.”

As they departed, Guan Yu called out, “Will the Zhenyang Sect forever hide like turtles? Skulking through generations?”

The elder whirled back, composure cracking. “Mind your tongue, young man. We endure while others falter. Our absence speaks to *their* failures, not ours.”

Guan Yu smirked. The Zhenyang Sect had vanished after the Righteous-Demon War a century prior, evading even the Demon Soul Sect’s searches. Yet here they were, cloaked in false modesty.

**Chapter 4602: Shadowing the Enemy**

After the war, the Zhenyang Sect had become legend—rumored extinct yet sporadically resurfacing. Now, lured by rumors of the Eight-Sided Drum technique, they emerged to vie for power.

Guan Yu advised, “Rest here and observe the Demon Soul Sect. Their elders might recognize you.”

The elder weighed the risks: admitting their identity by staying or facing ambush ahead. “We’ll proceed cautiously,” he decided.

As they left, a youth asked, “Grandfather Tan, why not ally with the Cloud Azure Sect? Their numbers would aid us.”

“The Cloud Azure Sect’s leader and ours are old allies,” Elder Tan replied. “If they’re nearby, we’ll join them. For now, we find shelter and wait.”

“But why don’t sect leaders handle such tasks themselves?” the youth persisted.

“A leader guards their sect’s honor and safety,” Elder Tan explained. “To venture out recklessly invites disaster. Our duty is to act as their hands and eyes.”

**Chapter 4603: Sweltering Heat**

The group pressed on, seeking a secure spot to await the fifteenth of the seventh month—the prophesied date for Miao City’s emergence. The stifling air clung to them, a portent of storms to come.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu retreated to his tent, mind racing. The Zhenyang Sect’s arrival complicated the fragile balance. With the Demon Soul Sect ahead and tempers fraying under the heat, the desert’s golden sands seemed poised to witness a clash of shadows and ambition.
