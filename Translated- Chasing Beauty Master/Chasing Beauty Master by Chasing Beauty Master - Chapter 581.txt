Huo Zhentian had no mood to bother with them at the moment. Rising from his seat, he slowly approached Guanyu with a genial smile. "Brother Guanyu, you truly haven't disappointed me. Yet I'm curious—if you were at your physical peak during the test, would the results have differed?"

Guanyu smiled wryly. Truthfully, stamina remained his Achilles' heel. The brief contact with the crystal orb had already wearied him. Yet years of hardship had forged willpower surpassing ordinary men. A mere show of determination would suffice to weather this trial.

"Sect Master, may I ask a question..."

"Speak freely. No need for formalities!" Huo Zhentian replied heartily.

"Earlier when Elder Suoluo announced the rules, one clause stated that top three performers could select suitable cultivation manuals from the Scripture Pavilion. Does this rule still hold?"

Huo Zhentian was no fool. Understanding Guanyu's implication, he chuckled after brief contemplation. "Haha, of course! Naturally it still..."

His words were interrupted as Griffin stood abruptly. "Sect Master, while I reluctantly accepted your exception allowing this outsider to test, now you include him in our rankings? Do you realize how this undermines others?"

"Undoubtedly there's impact," Huo Zhentian countered, "but only when skill proves inferior! Had their magic surpassed this 'outsider,' no issue would exist! I've repeatedly emphasized—rules are made by men and meant to be broken. Stubborn adherence to convention will see Huntian Sect trampled beneath others' feet!"

The assembly fell silent. Though not wholly convinced, none dared openly oppose their Sect Master. The most aggrieved was Enkes—moments ago scheming with Hu Xiaohai against Guanyu, now demoted from third to fourth place. The true loss wasn't rank but exchanging a magic scroll for Fire Spirit Pills.

"Guanyu! I, Enkes, swear eternal enmity! In the coming challenges, I'll make you pay in blood!" Enkes snarled as if Guanyu had slain his father.

Hu Xiaohai beside him inquired, "Sect Master, with testing concluded, when do challenges commence?" His glance toward Guanyu mingled provocation with wariness—the outsider's earlier display having unsettled him.

"Challenges may begin now. But are you certain to participate?" Huo Zhentian asked curiously. Typically, challengers were unqualified candidates targeting barely-qualified disciples. Elite disciples like Hu Xiaohai neither received nor issued challenges.

Yet Hu Xiaohai nodded coldly. "Not only I—he'll participate too!" He pointed at Enkes, who added viciously: "Since rules are made to be broken, let this first victim reclaim his due!"

Guanyu remained unperturbed by the results, his calmness further infuriating detractors. Elder Suoluo now interposed himself between Guanyu and the glowering duo, announcing: "Testing concludes. Unqualified may challenge qualifiers—vice versa permitted."

"But Uncle Suoluo," Huo Lingling interjected, "wasn't challenge privilege previously limited to..."

Enkes cut her off: "Enough of 'previously'! As Sect Master said—rules are for breaking! I'll reclaim what's mine!" All understood his meaning—third place's scripture access stolen by Guanyu's intrusion.

Yet the challenge's true purpose emerged as near-qualified disciples eyed barely-passed peers like hungry wolves. Though statistically improbable for level twos to defeat threes, this final chance meant avoiding laborer conscription.

Amidst tense atmosphere, Huo Lingling nudged Guanyu. "Look—they're all staring at you!"

Guanyu yawned before noticing dozens of hostile gazes. "Seems I'll be busy," he sighed.

Huo Lingling giggled. "I predicted this! They think us cheaters—me a spoiled brat, you a cripple. They dare not challenge me, so..."

"Though harsh, truth rings clear," Guanyu conceded. "Were I them, I'd pick easier targets."

Their whispers ceased as hulking youth Jamess marched over. "You're Guanyu? Let's duel!" Despite feigned courtesy, contempt flickered in his eyes—the test's shockwaves hadn't erased ingrained prejudice.

Guanyu exchanged glances with Huo Lingling before smiling. "Since you insist—I accept."

Jamess hesitated, torn between suspicion of fraud and fear of genuine power. Ultimately, pride won. "I'll expose him publicly! Pummeling him will make me today's star!"

Chapter 1472: Proving Mastery

As they took positions, observers noted stark contrast—Jamess' brawn against Guanyu's slight frame. Huo Zhentian watched anxiously, aware of Guanyu's recent recovery yet uncertain of his limits.

Jamess charged, fist engulfed in flames. "Phoenix Fist!" Guanyu sidestepped effortlessly. When Jamess intensified his assault, time seemed to slow for Guanyu. At the critical moment, he deflected the strike and countered with palm to chest.

"Thunderous Palm Strike!"

The deafening impact sent Jamess flying three meters. Crowds rushed to find him pale but alive, blood trickling from his lips, terror in his eyes.

Silence descended as reality struck—Guanyu's prowess was genuine. Huo Zhentian erupted in laughter, decades-long wish fulfilled as Huntian Sect's prodigy emerged.

Backstage, Hu Xiaohai whispered to shaken Enkes: "Go next. Fail, and I'll intervene."

Guanyu gazed at his palm, marveling at resurgent power. The crowd's awed murmurs washed over him—today marked not just a comeback, but the unveiling of mysteries buried since his fall from grace. As challengers reconsidered their folly, he smiled. The game had just begun.
