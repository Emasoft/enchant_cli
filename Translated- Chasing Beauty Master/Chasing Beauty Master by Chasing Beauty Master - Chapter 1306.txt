“That wretched boy, how annoying.” Wang Xiaorong cursed Guan Yu, then chuckled to herself, “Who knew he could be so caring toward friends, so generous, handsome, skilled in martial arts, and brimming with treasures?”

As she mused, her cheeks flushed unbidden. Yet a grim reality loomed before her—Guan Yu belonged to the righteous sects, while she was a member of the Demon Sect.

Even if Wang Xiaorong now fancied Guan Yu, their paths could scarcely converge unless one abandoned their identity—a near-impossible feat. As the daughter of the Demon Lord, she could never forsake her father. The only solution lay in persuading Guan Yu to join the Demon Soul Sect. After pondering, she deemed this plan viable. Her next task was to devise a way to lure Guan Yu into defecting.

The Demon Lord had ordered her to kill Guan Yu at the opportune moment, but not only was there no such opportunity—she couldn’t bring herself to strike. Poisoning proved futile, as Guan Yu and his companions meticulously checked their food with silver needles. Yet allowing Black Blood Ridge to seize the Blazing Heaven Furnace was unthinkable. Thus, Wang Xiaorong resolved to first help Guan Yu rescue his comrades.

At noon, Wang Xiaorong arrived at the inn and roused Guan Yu’s group. Having just lain down after discussing matters with Siqi, Guan Yu groaned, “Xiaorong, didn’t you tell us to rest? Why wake us now?”

“This place is no longer safe. Pack your things and follow me,” she stated bluntly.

Once outside, Wang Xiaorong scanned the street. Several vendors averted their gaze under her scrutiny—Black Blood Ridge spies surveilling Guan Yu’s group. These tails needed shaking off urgently.

Leaning close, she whispered to Guan Yu, “Ride out separately on horseback. Circle widely and regroup at the blacksmith’s shop west of the city in two hours. Understood?”

Grasping the situation, Guan Yu nodded and relayed the plan to Xiao Zhi and the others. The group split up, weaving through the city to lose their pursuers.

By nightfall, they reconvened a mile west of the city. Wang Xiaorong’s horse carried numerous bundles. “What’s all this?” Guan Yu asked, eyeing the luggage.

“Supplies for the rescue, obviously. Did you think I’m here for leisure?” She dismounted and tossed a bundle to Guan Yu. “Change into these clothes.”

“Here? Now?” Xiao Zhi glanced nervously at Siqi, his heart racing.

“Must you idiots go rescuing someone dressed like peacocks? Black attire—now!” Wang Xiaorong snapped.

Grumbling, they changed. Xiao Zhi’s hopes of glimpsing Siqi undressing were dashed when she simply layered the black robes over her clothes. The outfits, complete with wide-brimmed hats obscuring their faces, mirrored those of Black Blood Ridge subordinates—perfect for infiltration.

Wang Xiaorong explained, “Black Blood Ridge lies ten li ahead in a hilltop cavern. The approach through this poplar forest is riddled with traps. Follow my lead exactly, or you’ll die here.”

As they nodded, she distributed four cloth strips. “Keep these safe,” she warned, handing out incense sticks and flint. “Lose any item, and your corpse won’t be my concern.”

“We understand,” Guan Yu assured. “We’ll follow your commands.”

“Then we move out.” Wang Xiaorong spurred her horse forward, the group galloping toward their destination.

Deep within Black Blood Ridge’s sweltering cavern—where steam rose from uncertain depths below—the Blood Lord lounged on furs. His subordinate Heibao reported, “Lord, Guan Yu has vanished from the inn. Our watchers lost them at noon.”

“Lost?!” The Blood Lord shattered a table with one strike. “Useless vermin! Feed the failed trackers to Great Ox!”

Heibao cowered. “B-but Lord, with the hostage, Guan Yu must surface. Let us post notices citywide demanding the Blazing Heaven Furnace for her life.”

“Clever,” the Blood Lord purred, stroking his beard. “See it done.”

Nearby, the drugged hostage Xiaotong stirred awake. “Guan Yu’s too smart for your tricks!” she spat, rattling her chains.

“Feisty little thing,” the Blood Lord smirked. “But your value lies in your breath. Shouldn’t you hope for rescue?”

Xiaotong fell silent, torn between longing and dread. The Blood Lord chuckled. “Such spirit! Guard it well—your lover might yet trade his treasure for it.”

Under moonless skies, Wang Xiaorong halted at the poplar forest’s edge. “The entrance lies beyond. These trees mirror each other—only the mountain’s silhouette reveals the path.”

Guan Yu studied the jagged peaks. “Then why delay?”

“Five against hundreds—and the Blood Lord’s demonic bull?” Wang Xiaorong countered. “We sneak in, find Xiaotong, then strike.”

Xiao Zhi scoffed, “If you fear, stay behind!”

“That ‘bull’ feeds on human souls,” she hissed. “Its lightning magic shreds flesh. We avoid confrontation.”

As tensions rose, twigs cracked behind them. Guan Yu smiled. “Show yourself, Brother Jinci.”

The shadowy figure emerged—their hidden ace, the peerless warrior Jinci Lang. With grim nods, the team plunged into the lethal woods.
