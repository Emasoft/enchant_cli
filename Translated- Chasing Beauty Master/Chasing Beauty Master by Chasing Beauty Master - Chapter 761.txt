Guan Yu took a taxi and stopped a short distance from Yang Conghan's villa. After surveying the surroundings—the streets nearly empty at 2 a.m. despite being downtown—he stealthily entered the property. Finding no anomalies in Zhang Han's room, he waited until dawn. "Well, this trip was wasted. The culprit didn't show," he muttered.

If the target was Zhang Han herself rather than an object, what made her so valuable? Kidnapping attempts, drugging... Guan Yu pondered but found no answers, deciding to shelve the matter.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District for breakfast, Xue Jing knew of his midnight excursion but asked no questions. As a woman, she believed in supporting her man without prying—he’d share if he wished.

Driving his motorcycle to campus, Guan Yu passed scowling security guards acting like owed millions. Ignoring them, he headed straight in. Today marked the official recruitment for the newly announced Yu Gang. Word spread by Wei Hongwei had drawn swarms of students eager to join—Guan Yu's formidable reputation promised protection and opportunities under his banner.

Wang Hu soon approached in class. "Guan Yu, your gang's rise has shaken smaller groups. I want to join. Take my Brotherhood Society as your subsidiary. All members will answer to you."

Recognizing Wang Hu's sincerity and the strategic boost, Guan Yu agreed. "Welcome. The Brotherhood becomes Yu Gang's branch. You'll be Grand Elder, commanding both factions."

Wang Hu beamed—his new title outshone his previous role.

During break, crowds of male students queued to register with Wei Hongwei, now a vice leader alongside Jia Bo. The process included identity checks to weed out spies. Amid the chaos, Guan Yu flirted with Lü Mei, playfully touching her hand until security chief Du Zhao barged in with thuggish guards brandishing batons.

"Scram! No gang recruiting here!" Du Zhao barked. When a slow-moving student was punched bloody, tensions flared. Eyes turned to Guan Yu, testing his leadership.

"Everyone, disperse for now. We'll regroup later," Guan Yu ordered calmly, though inwardly seething. He noted onlookers' disappointment at his restraint but bided his time.

After the crowd left, Wei Hongwei fumed. "We looked weak!"

"Patience," Guan Yu replied. "Their arrogance will cost them soon."

Lü Mei worried he’d become another bully like Chen Maosheng. "We’re a legitimate group guiding lost students," he assured, though his true aim was consolidating power against rivals like Sun Xu and the security faction.

Later, visiting teacher Pan Xiaoxia’s empty office, Guan Yu flirted shamelessly. "Let me check your meridians," he offered, using the pretext to caress her hand before pulling her onto his lap. Their tryst was interrupted by Principal Zhang Taiping’s knock.

"Inviting Pan老师 to dinner?" the lecherous principal simpered.

"She’s tutoring me tonight," Guan Yu countered. When Zhang threatened expulsion, Guan Yu blackmailed him with knowledge of his collusion with Liu Shuowei.

"Spread this, and your wife learns everything," Guan Yu warned, exiting triumphantly as Zhang scrambled after him, suddenly compliant.
