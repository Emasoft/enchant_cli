“Why should I carry you? You’re so heavy—carrying you all the way to the mall would be exhausting!” Guan Yu rolled his eyes. He hadn’t even carried his own wife before. Carry *her*? He wasn’t so idle as to waste his strength on that.

“Hey, have you no gentlemanly manners? My ankle’s twisted this badly—how am I supposed to walk if you don’t carry me?”

Dongfang Huowu fumed indignantly. She was, after all, a great beauty. Couldn’t this guy show a little compassion?

Guan Yu remained unmoved, replying coolly, “What’s ‘gentlemanly manners’? Is it valuable? I’ll take a pound of it if you’ve got any!”

Ridiculous! That sort of thing wasn’t edible—why bother? Besides, it was Dongfang Huowu herself who had refused his offer to massage her ankle. What did that have to do with him?

“You—you—you!”

Dongfang Huowu gritted her teeth in frustration, itching to pounce on Guan Yu and bite him hard. The guy was utterly detestable. Fine! It was just a twisted ankle, not a broken arm or leg. She’d walk on her own!

Steeling herself, she struggled to stand despite the pain. But her ankle had swollen terribly, neglected until now, puffing up like a steamed bun. The moment she put weight on it, she cried out and stumbled toward the ground.

As her delicate rear threatened to collide brutally with the hard pavement, Dongfang Huowu inwardly groaned—her butt would surely split into four pieces this time.

Yet suddenly, a figure dashed forward and caught her in his arms.

Needless to say, it was Guan Yu.

“Hmph! I thought you didn’t care?” Dongfang Huowu secretly gloated but feigned disdain, pounding his chest with her dainty fists.

“Behave yourself, or I might just spank you!”

Exasperated by her antics, Guan Yu abruptly scooped her up in a bridal carry. Surprisingly, despite her curves, she weighed little—like a soft bundle of cotton, light and comfortable in his arms.

Dongfang Huowu had only wanted him to carry her on his back. Startled by the sudden lift, she instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck.

Meeting his gaze at such close proximity, her cheeks flushed crimson without warning.

“Hey, stop staring. I know I’m handsome, but control yourself,” Guan Yu remarked flatly, his eyes fixed ahead.

“Conceited! Narcissist!” She turned her face away, huffing.

Amused by her reaction, Guan Yu found her unexpectedly endearing.

The two-mile journey wasn’t particularly long. With his abilities, Guan Yu could have reached the destination in minutes even while carrying her. But to avoid revealing his true prowess, he walked normally. His stamina was formidable—carrying Dongfang Huowu, or even three or four more, posed no challenge.

Yet the sweltering heat eventually beaded his forehead with sweat. Noticing this, Dongfang Huowu pulled out a handkerchief and gently wiped his brow.

Guan Yu stared at her, baffled. “Dongfang Huowu, has the pain addled your brain?”

“What do you mean?” she asked, puzzled.

“If not, why the sudden kindness? Wiping my sweat doesn’t seem like you.”

Knowing her usual temperament—where expecting others to serve her was the norm—this act of consideration felt utterly out of character.

He was right. In her life, Dongfang Huowu had rarely shown such care for anyone beyond her parents. Even her elder brother, Dongfang Mu, had never received such treatment. Witnessing this scene would have shocked her family speechless.

Snapping back to reality, Dongfang Huowu blushed furiously at her uncharacteristic behavior, her cheeks ripe as apples.

*Could I… like this guy?*

The thought startled her. She shook her head vigorously, mentally chanting, *Impossible! We’ve only just met! He’s stingy, rude—nothing like my ideal man! I’m just being nice because he’s tired. That’s all!*

Noticing her pensive nods and headshakes, Guan Yu chuckled. “What’s with the theatrics? I thought you were having a seizure.”

“*You’re* the one having a seizure!” For some reason, Dongfang Huowu’s face burned hotter each time she glanced at him, her sharp tongue turning clumsy.

Guan Yu sighed, opting not to engage further.

“Hey, why’d you stop?” she asked as he halted abruptly.

“Stop? We’re here.”

Looking around, she realized they’d reached the parking lot, surrounded by onlookers smirking at the scene.

She shot Guan Yu an accusatory glare—he could’ve warned her!

“Put me down!”

Squirming under the crowd’s knowing gazes, she demanded release.

But Guan Yu replied calmly, “Stay still. I’ll get you into the car.”

Ignoring her protests, he carried her to the vehicle, gently settling her into the passenger seat and buckling her seatbelt.

Watching his meticulous care, Dongfang Huowu felt an unexpected sense of security. On reflection, he wouldn’t make a bad boyfriend—decent looks, formidable combat skills, tender when needed. Imperfect, yet surpassing most men.

In her mind, Guan Yu had suddenly become the epitome of an ideal partner.

“Hey, your lovesick act is showing again.”

**Chapter 1039: Become My Disciple**

“*You’re* the lovesick one!” Dongfang Huowu glared but refrained from further bickering.

To prevent her family from worrying, Guan Yu called Dongfang Mu before speeding toward the Dongfang residence. His driving surpassed professional racers’, the car weaving through traffic as scenery blurred past.

Most girls would’ve screamed in terror, but Dongfang Huowu gripped the door handle excitedly, urging, “Faster! Go faster!”

“Any faster and this car’s done for!” Guan Yu had already pushed the vehicle to its limits.

“Guan Yu, I never knew you drove like this! Do me a favor!” she shouted over the roar.

“What?”

“There’s this idiot who keeps challenging me to races. Help me crush him!”

“Why not do it yourself?” After trouncing elite racers, Guan Yu had lost interest—no challenge remained.

“I tried! But that moron recently apprenticed under some ex-racing legend. His skills skyrocketed—I can’t beat him now.”

The “idiot” was a wealthy heiress turned rival after her boyfriend developed an ill-advised crush on Dongfang Huowu. What began as petty jealousy escalated into high-stakes racing duels. Though initially dominant, Dongfang Huowu had recently lost repeatedly, her pride wounded by the rival’s smugness.

“No.”

Guan Yu refused flatly. If Dongfang Mu discovered him enabling her dangerous hobby, repercussions would follow.

“Why not?” Her glare could’ve killed.

“No reason. Just no.”

“If you don’t help… I’ll tell my brother you bullied me!”

“Go ahead!” Guan Yu welcomed this—Dongfang Mu would discipline *her*, not him.

Defeated, Dongfang Huowu resorted to pleading. “Please? I’ll do anything!”

Soft tactics finally wore him down. “*Anything*?”

“Yes!”

“Then become my disciple. From today, obey me unconditionally.”

“Deal!” She agreed instantly, then narrowed her eyes. “But no unreasonable demands—like… like asking me to marry you!”

Guan Yu choked, nearly slamming the brakes. “You’re overthinking!”

Flushing, she backtracked, “Just… no improper requests!”

“Fine.” He nodded, already envisioning the pampering he’d demand—tea service, massages. The thought of the Dongfang heiress waiting on him would scandalize Beijing’s elite.

Oblivious, Dongfang Huowu daydreamed of victory while Guan Yu plotted her “training.”

Upon arriving, Guan Yu hesitated to carry her inside, wary of misinterpretation. But Dongfang Huowu insisted, arguing, “It’s normal if I’m injured! My brother would blame you otherwise!”

Resigned, he carried her into the compound—prompting a swarm of relatives to gather.

A five-year-old boy toddled up, chirping, “Uncle! Candy!”

Guan Yu sweatdropped. “I’m not your uncle!”

Dongfang Huowu blushed furiously. “Little rascal, stop nonsense! He’s not!”

The child crossed his arms. “Liar! Only uncles carry aunties!”

“Brother Qicai! Sister Yazhi! Control your kid!” she yelled.

A young couple emerged, smirking. “Seems right to us. Why else would you let him carry you?”

The boy stuck out his tongue triumphantly.

“My ankle’s hurt! How could I fancy *him*?”

Guan Yu, now composed, noted the man’s approval. “He’s quite handsome—good match for you.”

Dongfang Huowu gaped indignantly as Guan Yu preened.

The man’s wife added, “He’s tall, dignified—nothing like your past flings.”

Dongfang Huowu shot Guan Yu a guilty glance. “Those were just jokes!”

Her “relationships” had been brief dalliances with celebrities, stringing them along without commitment—a fact her family knew well.

“Deny it all you want,” the woman teased. “Why explain if he’s not your boyfriend?”

**Chapter 1040: Boyfriend**

The crowd’s knowing looks cemented the misunderstanding. Guan Yu, embracing the role, carried her inside with theatrical care, while Dongfang Huowu’s protests grew increasingly feeble—her heart inexplicably fluttering at the charade.
