This was Guan Yu’s brilliant stratagem of deception!

His feud with the Haomen syndicate had reached white-hot intensity. Naturally, he couldn’t register for the race under his own name – he’d likely end up dead in the streets before even reaching the racetrack.

Thus, he immediately thought of his younger brother, Jiang Ziqi.

As a top-tier young master of the capital with formidable backing, Jiang Ziqi’s identity was perfect for registration. No one would connect him to Guan Yu, avoiding suspicion from Haomen.

Now, Guan Yu thought of Jiang Ziqi again.

It must be said that Jiang Ziqi had become Guan Yu’s number one subordinate, destined for endless toil.

“You’re treating Jiang Ziqi like a workhorse. Aren’t you afraid he’ll suddenly rebel?”

Li Xi’s question indirectly acknowledged Guan Yu’s approach.

“Heh, as long as he’s got half a brain, he won’t make that mistake!” Guan Yu laughed confidently.

“You’re truly a villain who collects others’ secrets and commits every evil deed!” Li Xi commented coolly.

Li Xi didn’t doubt Guan Yu’s confidence. She believed even more that Guan Yu must hold some leverage over Jiang Ziqi to make such an influential figure obey him.

This wasn’t an era where virtue commanded respect.

Guan Yu’s blossoming smile froze.

Calling it “collecting secrets” sounded elegant enough that he could accept it. But being labeled an “evil villain”? That he absolutely refused.

He knew this was mocking his previous “villainous” actions toward Li Xi. Guan Yu sighed inwardly – whether goddess or mortal woman, they were dangerous creatures who nursed grudges. One misstep and you’d step on a landmine!

“I’m leaving for Taiwan next week. What about you?”

Li Xi’s sudden subject change left Guan Yu momentarily disoriented.

“Could I take this as an invitation?” Guan Yu winked mischievously.

Li Xi tilted her head slightly. “Don’t flatter yourself. The Li family’s Taiwan market opened with your help. Having you there makes things easier.”

Though Li Xi claimed practical reasons, Guan Yu saw through the flimsy excuse.

His smile returned. “After this blow, Haomen’s in chaos. Their attention will shift from me. A Taiwan trip with a beautiful companion sounds perfect.”

Li Xi nodded slightly and stood. “I’ll take my leave then. See you next week.”

“Wait!” Guan Yu scrambled up.

“Something else?”

Rubbing his head with a guileless smile, Guan Yu gestured around the room. “There’s still a week before Taiwan. I can’t just sleep here every day, can I?”

His pleading eyes made his intention clear – he wanted to crash at her villa again.

Without reacting to his audacity, Li Xi paused briefly before striding out in her heels.

Guan Yu grinned wolfishly, rubbing his hands as he hurried after her.

**Chapter 958: The Debt Collector Arrives**

In a military compound in the capital, Jiang Ziqi hurled his phone at a massive LCD screen.

The shattering glass echoed through the room as his face darkened.

Xiao Dao stood silently nearby, accustomed to these outbursts. The transformation of this once-legendary figure into Guan Yu’s lackey had been complete.

“Perhaps this was fate’s design,” Xiao Dao sighed inwardly.

“Prepare the car. We’re visiting the Luxury Car Club tomorrow,” Jiang Ziqi suddenly ordered.

Xiao Dao nodded. He knew the club was Haomen’s headquarters.

Standing before floor-to-ceiling windows, Jiang Ziqi’s features twisted. His whitened knuckles and bleeding palms betrayed his fury. “Guan Yu!” he spat through clenched teeth.

Earlier, Guan Yu had ordered him to collect debts from Haomen. Being treated as an errand boy again was the final insult. Yet despite his hatred, Jiang Ziqi could only endure.

**Chapter 959: Disrespect Shown**

At Haomen’s heavily guarded headquarters, Li Yu listened to his subordinate Chang Qing’s report.

“Multiple large bets were placed on Guan Yu through sophisticated methods. I failed to detect them earlier...”

Li Yu waved off the apology. “Of course Guan Yu would exploit the betting pools. His victory was planned from the start.”

When a subordinate announced visitors claiming championship prize money, Li Yu’s face contorted with murderous intent. “Show me this man who dares oppose Haomen!”

In a conference room surrounded by guards, Jiang Ziqi sipped tea with apparent ease. The atmosphere crackled with tension until Li Yu arrived.

“Jiang family. Jiang Ziqi,” came the icy introduction.

Recognition dawned on Li Yu. The Jiang family’s military connections made them untouchable. Forcing a smile, he said, “What brings Young Master Jiang here?”

“Settle the debts,” Jiang Ziqi cut straight to the point.

Li Yu pretended ignorance. “I’m afraid I don’t understand.”

“Don’t play dumb!” Jiang Ziqi snapped as Xiao Dao shifted into combat stance.

Li Yu’s smile vanished. “Respect is mutual, Young Master Jiang. Making enemies benefits no one.”

“Is that a threat?” Jiang Ziqi’s eyes narrowed dangerously.

The standoff intensified, two powerful forces colliding over unpaid debts and wounded pride.
