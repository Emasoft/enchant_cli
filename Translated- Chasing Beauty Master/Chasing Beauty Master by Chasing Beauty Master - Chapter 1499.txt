“Why don’t I go with you to make the purchases?” Wang Xiaorong suggested.

Guanyu nodded and walked to Liu Yun’s room, knocking on the door. Liu Yun slowly opened it from inside. Guanyu said, “Liu Yun, I need to make arrangements. Since we may need to return to the town to resolve prior matters, it might be inconvenient to take you back and forth.”

“I understand. I overheard your conversation,” Liu Yun replied, meeting Guanyu’s gaze. The sincerity in Guanyu’s eyes showed no trace of ill intent.

Liu Yun continued, “But could I avoid going to the Demon Sect’s territory? If you leave, may I simply wait here for your return?”

Guanyu hadn’t expected this request. Perhaps the Demon Sect’s reputation in her mind was indeed unfavorable, and he saw no reason to force her. “Very well. Stay here with Xiaoyuan and remain cautious. I believe I’ll return within a few days, then escort you both home,” he assured her.

Guanyu considered it acceptable for Liu Yun and her daughter to remain. He could later request Demon Sect members to keep watch, ensuring their safety.

Wang Xiaorong, hearing Liu Yun’s words, initially wanted to retort against this slight toward the Demon Sect. But Wang Jun shook his head at her, signaling restraint. Realizing Guanyu might disapprove, she swallowed her words—arguing with ignorant folk seemed pointless.

The trio then left the inn and first visited a teahouse. “Where’s Brother Zuo Envoy?” Wang Xiaorong asked immediately upon entering.

“Ah, the Left Envoy mentioned handling some affairs. He didn’t specify his return time, Young Mistress. Please feel free to command us in his stead,” replied the elderly teahouse attendant.

“Do you know where quality steel is sold here?” Wang Xiaorong glanced back at Guanyu, realizing his required materials might not be available in one location. They’d need to procure items piecemeal.

Starting with steel, she added, “Assign someone familiar with this area to accompany me. I need to purchase materials.”

“Young Mistress, you’ve found the right person! Having resided here over a decade, I’ll guide you myself. I’m thoroughly acquainted with this place—ask me anything,” the elderly man offered.

Wang Xiaorong looked to Guanyu, who nodded approval. “Very well. First take me to procure premium-grade steel—not from common markets. Do you know specialized vendors selling rare items?”

“Indeed! There’s an auction house hosting nightly events, occasionally featuring exceptional goods. Shall I take you?” the elder suggested.

Leading the way, he explained Guanyu’s requirements: not large quantities, but superior metal for crafting crossbow frames—a demanding specification, as quality armaments required exceptional materials.

After some distance, the elder gestured ahead: “Young Mistress, behold—the largest auction house here.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded silently, signaling him to proceed. Material selection rested with Guanyu, who observed the bustling streets with admiration. This materials hub—Zhouji City—lived up to its reputation: sprawling, densely populated, and teeming with commerce. Multiple auction houses likely existed, all worth investigating when time permitted.

While major establishments displayed premium goods at premium prices, smaller venues might harbor overlooked treasures. Still, visiting this grand emporium first posed no harm—Guanyu spared no expense for worthy items.

Approaching the imposing auction house entrance, they marveled at its grandeur. A massive plaque spanned five meters in length, bearing golden characters: *Central Street Auction House*. The ostentatious facade reflected status—larger establishments flaunted greater wealth and prestige.

Stone statues flanking the entrance depicted fierce warriors, their menacing expressions deterring mischief-makers. Inside, the bustling hall swarmed with patrons—buyers, sellers, and spectators alike.

Wang Xiaorong inquired, “Such crowds! But isn’t the auction held nightly?”

The elder smiled. “The grand event occurs evenings, but smaller daytime auctions exist. Many come merely to observe—spectators must purchase admission tickets.”

Guanyu mused at the shrewd business model—profiting from both merchandise commissions and entrance fees. The atmosphere resembled theatrical entertainment, where bidding wars between wealthy nobles and merchants provided public spectacle.

“Zhouji City attracts affluent collectors and traders,” the elder elaborated. “They purchase curiosities or invest in goods for resale elsewhere. Competitive bidding between young masters of great houses creates dramatic scenes—both entertaining and educational for onlookers.”

Guanyu agreed—frequent exposure to rare items cultivated connoisseurship among regular visitors. “Let’s inquire about current auctions,” he suggested.

As they progressed, the elder explained: “Should no auction occur, the upper floors host permanent exhibitions—items sold at fixed (though steep) prices.”

“Cost matters not if quality satisfies,” Wang Jun interjected. “Guanyu spares no expense for excellence.”

**Chapter 3888: Gathering Materials (Part 1)**

The envisioned sidearm crossbow demanded compact size, lightweight construction, and formidable power—requirements necessitating premium materials. Common wood or sinew proved inadequate. Guanyu recalled a Western-designed miniature crossbow from his past—palm-sized yet capable of penetrating thick tree trunks with 5cm bolts. Its semi-automatic mechanism allowed rapid reloading via magazine-like quivers—an innovation he sought to replicate.

Such craftsmanship required extraordinary alloys. The original weapon appeared entirely metallic, even its bowstring. Recreating this in current circumstances posed challenges, but Guanyu remained determined to fashion superior armaments for Wang Xiaorong and Wang Jun.

“Young Mistress, let’s inspect the second floor,” the elder suggested. “You might find desired items there.”

Wang Xiaorong turned to Guanyu. “Shall we? We’ve time before the auction.”

Approving, Guanyu ascended to a marketplace-like expanse—counters displayed wares ranging from human-sized porcelain vases to thumbnail-sized luminous pearls. Though dominated by ornate gold/silver jewelry and decor, weaponry sections caught his eye. Among swords and sabers, an imposing suit of armor drew particular attention—massive enough to require a two-meter-tall wearer of Herculean build.

“Interested in General Ao’s armor?” A saleswoman approached. “Forged from refined steel a century ago, it weighs nearly 100 kilograms. Worn by the founding general who secured our emperor’s throne, it’s a unique historical artifact. Though battle-scarred, its strategic reinforcements at shoulders and heart remain pristine.”

Guanyu requested to examine the metal quality. Normally forbidden, the attendant permitted a tactile inspection given his serious intent. The weathered steel showed ordinary composition except at critical areas—superior alloy perhaps reserved for vital zones. Though primarily commemorative, its metal might be repurposed for crossbow frames if sufficiently resilient.

**Chapter 3889: Gathering Materials (Part 2)**

While the armor’s historical significance appealed to collectors, Guanyu assessed its practical value. The thick shoulder plates and breastplate showed superior metallurgy—potential material for reforging. However, the attendant cautioned against damaging the relic during examination.

Guanyu’s fingers traced a deep blade scar near the collar. “May I test the metal’s hardness?”

“Within reason,” the attendant conceded. “This survived countless battles—moderate testing won’t harm it.”

Withdrawing a dagger, Guanyu scraped discreetly at an inner surface. The steel’s resistance suggested high carbon content—promising for weaponcraft. His mind calculated: smelting down certain sections could yield enough material for multiple compact crossbows without destroying the armor’s integrity as an antique.

Meanwhile, the elder returned with news: “An auction begins within the hour—the only afternoon session before midnight’s grand event.”

“Excellent,” Wang Xiaorong exclaimed. “Guanyu, browse here until then. Perhaps you’ll find hidden gems.”

Nodding, Guanyu continued surveying merchandise. Among glittering trinkets, a glass case caught his eye—a peculiar mechanism resembling clockwork gears, possibly part of some ancient machinery. His fingers itched to dismantle and study it, but restraint held sway. Every artifact here carried stories; every purchase required strategic consideration.

As the auction hour approached, anticipation thickened. Somewhere within these walls lay the components for creating peerless weapons—and Guanyu intended to claim them all.
