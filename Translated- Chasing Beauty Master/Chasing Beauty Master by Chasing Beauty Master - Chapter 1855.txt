“Just these small fries?” Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) sneered. “It depends on how we fight. I’d consider lasting two breaths an overestimation.”

As she spoke, the Qin family guards brandished their sabers and charged at Guanyu. With fluid movements—one kick, two kicks, three kicks—Guanyu sent all dozen assailants sprawling backward. His crisp, elegant motions resembled a dance.

The current Guanyu was no longer the novice who first entered the martial world. In those days, he had relied on equipment—pistols, crossbows, throwing daggers. Now, his martial skills had advanced by leaps, his cultivation progressing a thousand li daily. Ordinary fighters stood no chance against him.

Though the Qin family commanded thousands of soldiers, Guanyu cared not. Destroying them would pose little difficulty. His display of skill drew varied reactions—gasps of awe, suspicion, curiosity—from the surrounding crowd.

“So the fellow actually has some skill,” murmured Sister Mei, observing from the second floor of Wanyang Restaurant despite not stepping outside. “This Wan Hong’s martial prowess runs deep. He’s not to be underestimated.”

Jiang Xin (Heart’s Mirror) had shut her eyes in terror when the guards swarmed Guanyu, expecting him to be hacked to pieces. Yet when the screams subsided, she opened her eyes to find him standing unscathed, as motionless as a mountain.

Chapter 4876: Fear

Guanyu stood like an immovable peak, one hand clasped behind his back, gazing disdainfully at the Qin guards writhing on the ground. Chu Fan (Mortal Song), an opera performer with some martial knowledge, had clearly witnessed Guanyu’s movements. The speed displayed—swifter than a galloping horse—marked him as a true master.

“Sister Xiaorong, you were right!” Qiqi (Jade Jade) giggled, clapping her hands. “They lost faster than a sneeze! Even I could defeat such useless fellows!” The two girls treated the affair as light amusement, their carefree laughter contrasting sharply with Jiang Xin and Chu Fan’s anxiety.

Bystanders reacted diversely—some silently cheered the downfall of Qin’s bullies; others marveled at the audacity of challenging the capital’s foremost family. A few simply relished the spectacle, craving greater drama.

“I know your Qin family rules this capital,” Guanyu declared coldly, his voice thunderous with authority. “But today you’ve chosen the wrong target. No one in this world may touch my women.” He suddenly pointed at Qu Hua (Brilliant Flower), making the injured man flinch. “This was but a warning. Threaten them again, and you dig your own grave.”

Guanyu’s aura of dominance rippled through the crowd—commoners, merchants, nobles alike. This display of power would make “Wan Hong” reverberate through the capital like summer thunder.

Yet to his surprise, the Qin retainers showed no fear. Qu Hua’s twisted face burned with hatred. Raised in privilege, accustomed to tyranny, he trusted his family’s invincibility. “Useless dogs!” he screamed at his cowering guards. “Seize him! And don’t let those two bitches escape!”

The two elite guards surged forward, displaying decent qinggong (Lightness Skill). Guanyu initially dodged their coordinated attacks, then snapped a wrist with brutal efficiency, confiscating a saber. “Mere decorations,” he scoffed as he disarmed them, sending both flying with precise kicks.

Chapter 4877: Reckoning

“Pathetic,” Qiqi remarked, arms crossed. “Why does the Qin family waste silver on such trash?”

“Their coffers overflow,” Wang Xiaorong retorted. Secretly, she wondered why Guanyu showed restraint—the Guanyu she knew during Prince Zou’s days would have left corpses, not groaning men.

From her vantage point, Sister Mei mused, “This Wan Hong remains an enigma. His background demands investigation.” Similar thoughts occupied many observers—who was this mysterious youth who gifted priceless treasures, befriended nobility, and now defied the Qin?

Jiang Xin flushed, recalling how Guanyu had once carried her airborne, his “accidental” brushes against sensitive areas. Though indignant then, she now secretly longed for another flight—provided he behaved.

Guanyu pointed at Qu Hua’s carriage. “Leave now if you value your life. The matter ends here. But tell your Qin masters—I welcome their challenges anytime.” His voice carried imperial finality.

Qu Hua fled like a whipped cur, but everyone knew this wasn’t over. The Qin would return with greater force. Yet Guanyu cared not—his concern was finding new lodgings, having severed ties with Red Opera House.

News of the confrontation spread like wildfire, reaching even the Imperial Palace. During court discussions, the Second Prince warned: “Father, this Wan Hong appeared suddenly. He’s already clashed with two great families. We must ascertain his origins.”

Emperor Xuan nodded gravely. “Dispatch investigators. And Prince Zou—visit the Imperial Consort’s residence. Learn what the Princess knows of this man.”

Meanwhile, Tang Muchen (Wood Dust) consulted his father about allying with the Duan family against rumored Qin-Cao collusion. Elder Tang stroked his beard thoughtfully. “The Duan girl’s claims require verification. We move cautiously.”
