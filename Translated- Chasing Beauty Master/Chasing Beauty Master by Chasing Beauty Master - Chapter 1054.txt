Today marked the grand opening of Ma Tong's casino, and the Yu Gang members clearly couldn't tolerate his profit-making in this territory. They'd undoubtedly sent thugs to wreck the place.

Observant individuals noted Guan Yu's conspicuous absence—perhaps Ma Tong's failure to invite him for the casino's inauguration had provoked this retaliatory strike.

Various theories swirled through the crowd's minds as two dozen assailants first beat the assistants to the ground, then stormed upstairs to smash gambling equipment. No one was spared—those who lagged behind faced brutal blows.

Chaos reigned in the newly ruined casino. Many stood paralyzed, unprepared for this disaster. Ma Tong had foolishly postponed hiring security for the opening day, never imagining anyone would dare attack his establishment.

While bedlam erupted outside, the office remained undisturbed. Fang Su's hands roamed freely over the woman's body, his positioning artfully blocking Ma Tong's view. The woman remained silent this time, her deliberate slowness in opening the wine bottle suggesting she relished this illicit interlude.

To Fang Su's surprise, this vixen proved more wanton than even Liu Chan. Clearly, Ma Tong hadn't been satisfying her needs. As Fang Su's groping intensified, the woman nearly collapsed—only his quick reflexes prevented her from crashing into a wine rack.

When Ma Tong's impatient voice cut through the tension—"Can't you useless women even open a bottle properly?"—the clever mistress stayed silent, knowing any vocal response would betray their activities. Fang Su smoothly covered: "Almost done. Madame Ma injured her fingers—I'm assisting."

"Fucking useless bitches. Should've raised dogs instead," Ma Tong spat. As the cork finally popped, Fang Su poured the 1982 vintage with feigned nonchalance.

Ma Tong raised his glass. "A toast! Honored by Young Master Bill's presence today—"

His phone's ill-timed ring interrupted the gesture. Seeing his assistant's name, Ma Tong cursed: "Blind motherfucker calling now?"

The assistant's labored breathing filled the line. "Boss... emergency... where are you?"

"Fuck your ancestors! Can't you see I'm entertaining VIPs? What's happened—your period came early?"

"They... they wrecked the place! Yu Gang thugs—twenty of them!"

"What?!" Ma Tong roared. The office's soundproofing—originally installed for private "entertainment"—had blocked all noise from the destruction below. Rushing to the window, he saw guests fleeing the chaos.

"Who dares challenge me?!"

"They claimed Yu Gang sent them. No prior conflicts... don't know why..."

Ma Tong's face purpled with rage. A grand opening ruined—this humiliation would reverberate through every underworld circle in China. After spewing curses, he barked: "Summon Leopard and Bull with all their men! Drag Guan Yu here in chains!"

As Ma Tong stormed out, Fang Su and Bill Lin exchanged knowing glances. Bill feigned concern: "Trouble with Yu Gang?"

"That fucking Guan Yu!" Ma Tong spat. "Sends men to smash my casino—says they'll destroy every venue I open here!"

Bill clucked false sympathy. "How reckless. We've both clashed with Yu Gang—their reach extends further than you'd imagine."

"Their boss is just some college punk!" Ma Tong scoffed.

Bill's tone turned grave. "Don't underestimate him. Guan Yu commands two formidable identities—CEO of Huayu Group and future son-in-law of the Yang Clan, leaders of the Four Great Families."

Ma Tong's bluster faltered. These revelations changed everything—Huayu's financial might combined with Yang Clan's influence made Guan Yu virtually untouchable.

Fang Su interjected: "He never openly uses Huayu's resources, but those elite bodyguards? Definitely corporate-funded."

Bill nodded. "Even my men couldn't defeat his protectors. That level of security requires Huayu's deep pockets."

Ma Tong's fists clenched. Though seething over his ruined casino, confronting this dual-powered adversary required caution. Yet pride demanded retaliation—especially with Bill's subtle prodding.

"Set up a meeting," Ma Tong growled. "We'll use your knowledge of his weaknesses. Even emperors can fall—let's see how long this college boy lasts against united forces."

As assistants scrambled to contact mercenaries, Bill concealed a triumphant smile. Another powerful enemy for Guan Yu—exactly as planned.
