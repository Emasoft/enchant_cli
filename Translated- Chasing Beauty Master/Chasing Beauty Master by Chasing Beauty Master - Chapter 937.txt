“Hmm? But what?” Director Song asked inexplicably.

“Oh, n-nothing... I’ll head downstairs first if there’s nothing else.” Xiao Lu stammered, then hurried down the stairs.

Director Song watched her retreat with a puzzled frown. *Could the Deputy Director have done something to her? Even if he’s crossed lines before, he wouldn’t target a pregnant woman, would he? If that’s truly the case, I’ll have to give him a stern warning.*

Shaking his head dismissively, he convinced himself it couldn’t be. Though the Deputy Director’s conduct was often questionable, even he wouldn’t stoop to such bestial behavior.

Inside the office, Xue Jing seethed, “I’ll give you one chance. Tell me where you’ve taken Guanyu right now, or today’s matter won’t end simply.”

“You think you can intimidate me, brat?” the Deputy Director sneered, his comical appearance undermined by the blood trickling from his nose and the hand clutching his stomach. “Anyone who enters this place won’t leave easily!”

But Xue Jing, too worried about Guanyu to humor his theatrics, snapped, “Last chance. If you don’t tell me Guanyu’s whereabouts, I guarantee you’ll be stripped of your deputy title by tomorrow.”

“Damn it! You think I’m scared of your threats?” he barked, laughing bitterly. “Who do you think you are—the Jade Emperor? I wasn’t raised on empty threats! If you don’t submit today, forget about seeing your friend!”

**Chapter 2,396: Two Versions**

Xue Jing, frantic with worry, repeated, “Last chance. If you don’t tell me where Guanyu is, you’ll lose your position by tomorrow!”

“Hell! You think I fear your bluffs?” he retorted, spittle flying. “I’ll say it again—obey me, or you’ll never see him!”

The office door slammed open. “Who the hell barges in without knocking?” the Deputy Director roared.

“Watch your tone!” Director Song’s voice cut coldly through the room. “What’s all this noise? This is a police station, not a market.”

The Deputy Director paled. “A-Ah, Director Song! What brings you here?”

“Can’t I visit? What happened? Why are you bleeding?”

“This girl attacked me! I was just about to have her arrested!” the Deputy Director whined, playing the victim.

“You’re the director? Perfect timing,” Xue Jing interjected. “I came here looking for someone, but this scoundrel lured me in and assaulted me. He deserved every hit!”

Though aware of his deputy’s misconduct, Director Song opted to side with him—their camaraderie, forged through bribes and shared indulgences, demanded it. Men, after all, had their weaknesses.

“Enough lies!” the Deputy Director coughed, feigning outrage. “No one will believe you! I’ll have you arrested!”

“You said you’re here for someone. Who?” Director Song asked, noting Xue Jing’s refined demeanor. Crossing the wrong person could spell disaster.

“Guanyu.”

Director Song stiffened. The Yang Family’s patriarch had personally called to demand Guanyu’s release. “Guanyu was never detained here. We let him go.”

“One claims he’s imprisoned, the other says he’s free. Who do I believe?” Xue Jing glared.

“Guanyu was released en route after the Yang Family’s intervention. He never arrived here,” Director Song insisted, name-dropping to imply favor-trading.

“You liar! All that ‘calling to check’ was just an act to grope me!” Xue Jing turned to leave, but Director Song blocked her path.

“Please extend my regards to the Yang Family,” he said smoothly.

“Regards? This man—” she jabbed a finger at the Deputy Director, “—must resign. I’ll ensure it.”

Realizing his blunder, the Deputy Director groveled. “I-I was blind! Please, show mercy!”

Xue Jing scoffed. “If Guanyu knew what you did, you’d be half-dead already. Pack your things—your tenure ends now.”

Director Song chastised him, “Fool! Guanyu is the Yang Family’s son-in-law! Had we detained him, this entire bureau would’ve been purged!”

Trembling, the Deputy Director bowed. “M-My apologies, madam! I didn’t know!”

“Save your theatrics. Your resignation is inevitable.” Xue Jing strode out.

After her exit, Director Song berated his deputy. “You’ve doomed yourself! Guanyu’s allied with the Lü and Yang Families, runs Huayu Group, and is a national taekwondo champion! Provoke him, and you’re dead!”

The Deputy Director crumpled onto a sofa, muttering, “Is there no way out...?”

“Beg Guanyu for forgiveness, or that girl. Otherwise, pack your bags.”

Defeated, the Deputy Director whimpered, “But the Feng Family...?”

“The Fengs barely survived Guanyu’s wrath themselves! Their heir hired top assassins, wasted billions—all failed. You think they’ll save you?”

Slumping further, the Deputy Director whispered, “So... it’s over?”

“Should’ve kept your hands to yourself. Even the ‘entertainment’ in Guanyu’s Qiaoyuan District is off-limits!”

**Chapter 2,397: Packing Up**

Meanwhile, Xue Jing discovered Guanyu’s phone was off—he’d already passed airport security, evading her. Sighing, she drove home, vowing, “You’ll get an earful later.”

At the airport, Guanyu relaxed. Boarding in five minutes—he’d escaped cleanly, sans entourage.

“Guanyu? Is that you?” A melodic voice startled him. He turned to see Lan Yu’s playful grin.

“Lan Yu? What’re you doing here?”

“Vacationing with friends! Off to Japan. You too?”

Guanyu groaned. *Coincidence... or another babysitter?*

**Chapter 2,398: Serendipity**

Lan Yu beamed. “Same flight? How fun!”

Guanyu sighed. *Alone time? Not today.*
