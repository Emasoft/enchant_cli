The two men smiled faintly and pressed a green button by the main gate. Instantly, billowing dust rose from the ground accompanied by deafening rumbles. Moments later, an elevator materialized in the center of the courtyard.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. Truly, different circles employed different methods. While the cultivation world used mystical arts like Qimen Dunjia to conceal secrets, the Dragon Group utilized high-tech solutions by building their headquarters underground. Without knowing the mechanism, none would suspect the prestigious organization's subterranean location.

The facility proved impressive. Beyond the elevator lay a vast square flanked by towering modern structures. Though lacking the ancient majesty of White Cloud Temple, it exuded technological sophistication and contemporary flair.

As Guan Yu surveyed his surroundings, a coldly melodious voice rang out: "Well, if it isn't Young Master Guan! To what do we owe this rare visit to Dragon Group headquarters?"

Without turning, Guan Yu recognized the sarcastic tone. Within the entire organization, only the two operatives codenamed One and Two held grudges against him since their last encounter.

"Ah, if it isn't my two defeated challengers! How delightful to see you again," Guan Yu retorted cheerfully. Though seeking assistance today, he'd never tolerate disrespect.

"Defeated challengers?!" The pair flushed crimson, fingers trembling as they pointed accusingly. "Who are you calling defeated?!"

"Need I remind you of our last encounter?" Guan Yu's voice dropped dangerously. "Moreover, I detest being pointed at. Lower your fingers unless you wish them broken."

As the trio confronted each other, operatives Eagle and Tiger observed the spectacle with amusement, making no move to intervene. The commotion drew curious onlookers who quickly identified Guan Yu, their expressions shifting to recognition. Though visiting Dragon Group for the first time, his reputation preceded him.

Codename One and Two stood paralyzed. Pride prevented compliance, yet they knew confronting Guan Yu publicly risked humiliating defeat. Trapped between honor and pragmatism, they stiffened like statues.

Salvation arrived in the form of a tall youth. "Panther!" they cried desperately.

Codename Panther swept his gaze across the scene, icy aura intensifying when landing on Guan Yu. The air crackled with palpable energy.

Guan Yu's brows furrowed. "Impressive presence."

Chapter 1112: Acquiring Subordinates

Panther, Dragon Group's "War God" and leader of Eagle and Tiger's squad, thrived on challenging powerful opponents. Seeing their commander's battlelust ignited, One and Two exchanged triumphant glances.

The combat specialist possessed unique perception - his fighting spirit intensified when sensing worthy adversaries. Having long anticipated this confrontation, Panther seized the opportunity.

"I challenge you," he declared impassively.

"Not interested," Guan Yu waved dismissively. "I'm here for documents, not petty squabbles."

"Afraid?" Panther's sneer dripped contempt.

"Childish taunts won't work." Guan Yu turned to Eagle. "Fetch the files."

The operatives remained motionless. With Panther unyielding, none dared obey. Moreover, summoning Guan Yu aimed precisely at humbling his arrogance.

Guan Yu's expression darkened. "Explain yourselves."

"Documents require passing my test first!" Panther stepped forward, aura swelling as admirers watched reverently. The duel became inevitable.

Exhaling sharply, Guan Yu suddenly erupted: "What's with this pretense? Dragon Group's all bark? Codename Panther? Why not Kitten? As for you two - call yourselves Square Root of Three! Send real challengers if you want entertainment!"

The crowd gaped. Guan Yu's coldly intellectual reputation clashed violently with this vulgar outburst.

Undeterred, he continued: "Cat got your tongues? Where's Dragon Group's famous..."

"Enough!" Panther roared. "Accept my challenge!"

"What's my prize for winning?"

"You won't."

"Careful your tongue doesn't trip you," Guan Yu scoffed. "One punch would finish you."

"Guan Yu!" Panther trembled with rage, inept at verbal sparring. "Do. You. Accept?"

"Gladly! Nothing pleases me more than disciplining arrogant pups. But stakes first."

"Name them."

"If I win, you deliver the demon sect files and serve me three years."

"And if you lose?"

"Do with me as you will."

"Done!" Panther lunged panther-quick, fist whistling through air.

"Cheap shot!" Guan Yu barked, hands already forming seals. A white energy wave blasted Panther meters backward. Cultivator's qi - invisible yet devastating - proved overwhelming against mere physical prowess.

"Cheater!" One and Two shouted.

"Cheating?" Guan Yu smirked. "No rules barred techniques. Unless Dragon Group fears true power?"

The accusers fell silent.

"Still不服(unconvinced)?" Guan Yu taunted the prone Panther.

"...Unconvinced!"

"Then rise for another lesson!"

Panther sprang up, delivering a thunderous blow that could dent steel plates. Yet upon striking Guan Yu, tremendous反弹力(rebound force) hurled him airborne again.

"How?!" The War God stared at undamaged fists.

"Your concern?" Guan Yu loomed overhead. "Submit or keep tasting defeat."

Silence hung heavy. Finally, under collective gaze, Panther gritted: "...Submit."

Gasps rippled through observers. Dragon Group's elite commander becoming another's subordinate? Unthinkable disgrace! Yet none dared intervene - none surpassed Panther's might.

"Your resentment means nothing," Guan Yu stated coolly. "Honor your vow. Challenge me again when stronger, but betray me..." He let the threat linger. "Now. The files."

Chapter 1113: Southern Preparations

"Understood," Panther ground out through humiliation.

As Eagle and Tiger led Guan Yu away, the victor ignored his new subordinate. True confidence required neither gloating nor fear - defeated opponents stayed defeated. Whether Panther rose from this humiliation or broke mattered little to Guan Yu.

The archives entrance revealed an unremarkable middle-aged man. "Director," Eagle and Tiger saluted.

Guan Yu blinked. This plain, smiling man led Dragon Group? No imposing aura, just paternal warmth.

"Leave us," the director ordered. When alone, he chuckled: "Not matching expectations?"

"Frankly, no."

"Appearances deceive." Producing an obsidian rod, he explained: "A cultivation artifact for your demon-hunting mission."

Guan Yu inspected the unremarkable object skeptically. "Feels mundane."

"All will clarify in time." The director's eyes twinkled. "Dragon Group welcomes all talents - including discreet cultivators."

After accepting the dubious "gift" and receiving the promised USB drive, Guan Yu departed for Zhou Manor. Analysis revealed the demon sect's base beneath G City's abandoned factory - formerly an ancient temple atop spiritual ley lines.

"Ancient sanctums become demon nests," cultivator Wan Qingyang noted grimly.

"Then we depart in three days," Guan Yu declared. After settling affairs with the Wen and Liu families, entrusting businesses to trusted allies, he bid farewell to lovers in N City.

Chapter 1114: Rescue

With mortal ties secured, Guan Yu focused wholly on cultivation and the impending mission. Old Master Wen joked about passing family legacies to unborn grandchildren, while the Liu patriarch lamented ruined descendants.

Final preparations complete, Guan Yu stood ready. The southern journey would test more than martial prowess - it demanded confronting darkness that threatened both mortal and cultivation realms. Yet as he gazed southward, anticipation burned brighter than apprehension. The game had truly begun.
