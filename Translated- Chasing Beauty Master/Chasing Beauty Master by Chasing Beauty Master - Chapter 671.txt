Half a month passed in this manner. During this period, Guan Yu made several trips back to Y City, completely curing Auntie Sun's illness. Now Auntie Sun finally realized she had mistaken Guan Yu's identity initially. Yet through this twist of fate, Guan Yu had truly become her son-in-law, filling Auntie Sun with indescribable joy.

According to Sun Xiaoya, after Wang Jun recovered from his injuries and returned to Mingyang School, he underwent significant changes. No longer the domineering bully of before, he reportedly persuaded his father to purchase a serum injection that transformed him into a Pseudo-ESP User. Clearly, Mu Yun had revealed Guan Yu's true identity to Wang Jun, who now aspired to become a hero like Guan Yu—a meaningful legacy Guan Yu left in Mingyang.

Before departing, Guan Yu imparted cultivation techniques to Yang Lin, who could now be considered an Ancient Martial Inheritor. After Guan Yu cured his father's illness and Wang Jun ceased bullying him, Yang Lin's family circumstances improved to manageable levels despite remaining financially strained.

To further assist Yang Lin's family, Guan Yu planned to recruit Yang's father into Huanyu Group. With covert support from both military and Dragon Group factions, it would be foolish not to leverage this opportunity for rapid corporate expansion.

Over these fifteen days, Huanyu Group's technicians collaborated with the Ouyang family's engineers to successfully replicate the weapons originally developed by Eastern Islanders for the Ouyangs. Now awaiting final improvements and prototype testing, the military had already signed a 300 million yuan contract for thirty units of these temporarily named Godslayer Rifles. Additional contracts for military vehicle equipment totaling over 10 billion yuan kept the entire Huanyu Group bustling—all except Chairman Guan Yu himself.

On this particular morning, Huang Yating informed Guan Yu of visitors the moment he entered his office. Hou Jinshun had arrived in the capital with Yang Lin's father Yang Mingchuan and Xue Jing.

While Hou and Yang were expected, the appearance of mischievous Xue Jing came as a surprise. Xue Yingfeng had mentioned in recent calls that his daughter constantly asked about "Big Brother" Guan Yu, but none anticipated her persistence in tagging along.

Bursting into the office, Xue Jing exclaimed, "Big Brother! You're so mean! You came to the capital without telling me! Dad says you're different now—too busy for me. Tell me, are you still my Big Brother or not?"

Guan Yu couldn't help smiling at the memory of this lively girl who'd nearly been kidnapped during their lizard-hunting escapade. She tugged his hand petulantly, "We promised to elope together! Why did you sneak off alone? Promise-breaker!"

Under Hou and Yang's raised eyebrows, Guan Yu hastily protested, "Jingjing! Don't say such things! If your sisters-in-law hear this, I'll be in trouble! I never agreed to elope—that was your idea!"

Pouting, the girl declared, "I won't call them sisters-in-law! When I grow up and marry you, I'll be the first wife!"

Dark lines of exasperation formed on Guan Yu's forehead. "Fine, we'll discuss that when you're older. Does your father know you came with Brother Hou?"

"Of course!" She nodded vigorously. "I told him I'm learning skills from Brother Houzi. He agreed immediately."

Guan Yu contemplated using spiritual energy infusion to rapidly develop powerful subordinates, surprised Xue Jing sought Ancient Martial inheritance. Studying her intently, he grasped her wrist.

Blushing as his large hand enveloped hers, Xue Jing whispered, "Big Brother... Uncle Yang and Brother Houzi are watching..."

The two men exchanged glances, mentally branding Guan Yu a pervert. As they retreated to chat with Huang Yating, Xue Jing pressed closer despite Guan Yu's backpedaling into his desk.

"You can't escape me," she purred like a vixen, petite frame melding against him. "We'll roam the martial world together, eliminating villains as immortal lovers!"

Though reminding himself she remained a child, Guan Yu couldn't ignore the soft curves brushing his chest or the floral scent of her hair. Channeling spiritual energy into her meridians, his eyes widened in shock.

Rechecking confirmed his discovery—Xue Jing possessed an innate Water Attribute constitution, a one-in-a-billion purity! Elated, he lifted her spinning, only to have the girl seize the moment for a movie-perfect kiss attempt.

"Where did you learn these tricks?" He tapped her forehead, reluctantly pecking her lips when met with puppy-dog eyes.

Xue Jing triumphantly declared, "Sealed with a kiss! You're mine now! No more flirting without my permission—unless I approve the girls!"

Guan Yu groaned internally at being "claimed" by this teenage tyrant. Placing her on the desk, he explained, "Little imp, you're actually a treasure! You have a supreme Water Attribute physique!"

In the outer office, Hou Jinshun's attempts to flirt with Huang Yating took surreal turns. "Miss Huang, might I inquire if you're single?"

The android secretary smiled uniformly. "I've been operational for three months without a boyfriend. Perhaps the company will manufacture one later."

Xue Jing whispered, "Husband, is she... a robot?" Startled by her perceptiveness, Guan Yu nodded subtly.

Unaware, Hou pressed on: "Would you consider me? At first sight, I felt you were my destined love!"

Observing Huang Yating's faintly hopeful expression, Guan Yu intervened: "Brother Hou, Yating isn't ordinary. Can you accept that?"

"Whatever her peculiarities, she's my soulmate!" Hou declared passionately. "This feels like rebirth!"

Xue Jing chimed in: "Exactly! True love ignores backgrounds! This is real romance!"

As Guan Yu facepalmed, the scene encapsulated his chaotic yet vibrant world—where ancient cultivation met robotic assistants, battlefield weapons coexisted with boardroom deals, and a teenage girl's whims could upend an immortal's composure.
