**Chapter 1564: Yao Mi’er**

Yao Mi’er stared at Guan Yu, who held the Soul-Devouring Whip, and suddenly burst into laughter—a piercing, ear-splitting cackle that forced Guan Yu and the surrounding demons to cover their ears. Her petite frame began to swell grotesquely, expanding until she loomed half the size of a building. Her once-friendly, girl-next-door visage twisted into a monstrous visage: a gaping, carnivorous-flower mouth lined with razor-sharp fangs, while her pink hair transformed into dripping petals that oozed dark green venom. The liquid sizzled as it struck the ground, emitting acrid fumes. Her body morphed into a tangle of plant-like roots, their veined tendrils pulsating faintly beneath the surface.

“A demon’s true form!” gasped the onlookers. In the Demon City, revealing one’s primal demonic body was strictly forbidden. Yet Yao Mi’er had dared defy the City Lord’s decree! But she no longer cared—today, either the Asura would die, or she would perish. Desperation left her no choice but to gamble everything.

“Asura! Today, one of us dies!” Yao Mi’er’s bulging eyes burned with hatred as she glared at Guan Yu. Her petals turned jet-black and hurtled toward Guan Yu and Hu Xiaohai, forcing them to retreat and defend themselves with their powers.

“How much longer can you hold on, Asura?” Yao Mi’er sneered, intensifying her assault. Hu Xiaohai watched Guan Yu, now bloodied, with growing worry. “Xiaoxue, are you alright?” Guan Yu shook her head. “I’ll live. What about you?” Though relieved by her response, Hu Xiaohai—bound to Guan Yu as her weapon’s spirit—knew the truth of her injuries.

“I’m an ancient direbeast! My very essence is poison. How could her petty toxins harm me?”

Above the arena, Ming turned to Hong Feng. “City Lord, this—”

“Watch closely,” Hong Feng interrupted, his gaze cold. *This is the price of mercy. Here, weakness is death.* Ming’s eyes remained fixed on Guan Yu. Over time, he’d grown to understand—and pity—her plight. Yet his duty bound him to obey.

Finally, Guan Yu’s powers flickered back to life under the light element’s influence. “Hu Xiaohai! End this!”

Understanding instantly, Hu Xiaohai lunged at Yao Mi’er. The demoness, ignoring his advance, focused all her fury on Guan Yu. “Die, Asura!”

Guan Yu’s lips curled into a sinister smile as she raised the Soul-Devouring Whip. Yao Mi’er’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Impossible!”

“Nothing’s impossible.” With a final scream, Yao Mi’er fell. Guan Yu recalled Hu Xiaohai into the whip and strode from the arena under the demons’ stunned gazes. *Unkillable?* Ming watched her retreating figure with newfound respect.

Blood dripped from Guan Yu’s wounds as she walked the streets, her scent drawing hordes of demons. Yet none attacked. She knew why—the City Lord wouldn’t let her die so easily. But she was wrong. Hong Feng had issued no such order. The demons held back not out of fear but respect—for her resilience, her power to rival a Saint Sovereign, and the unyielding spirit that earned her the title “Asura King.”

Back at Slayer’s Abode, Guan Yu collapsed onto her bed, too weary to heal. Hu Xiaohai nursed his own wounds silently within the whip. After a moment, she rose to tend her burns. Tracing a scar on her face, she whispered, “Is this the cost of mercy? Father, Mother… would you even recognize me now?”

**In the Netherworld**
Beneath a full moon, Tian Huanyun sighed. “Xiaoxue, my child… where are you?”

“Mother, rest.” A white-clad figure emerged behind her—Ming Hanfeng.

“Any news?” she asked.

“She’ll return,” he lied, masking his guilt. Four years ago, he’d hidden the truth: Xiaoxue’s disappearance tied to Akali’s betrayal. Even now, the memory haunted him. *How could a father sacrifice his own child?*

**Two Years Later**
A crimson-clad figure strode into the arena, igniting the crowd’s roar: “Asura King!” Her obsidian mask obscured most of her face, leaving only a chilling gaze fixed on her opponent—a demon trembling in terror.

None who faced her survived intact.

Guan Yu advanced relentlessly, her prey retreating until cornered. The demon summoned a golden hammer, clutching it like a lifeline.

“Hu Xiaohai,” she said lazily, “your turn.”

A shadow flashed. Before the crowd could react, the demon’s head vanished. The black-cloaked Hu Xiaohai reappeared beside Guan Yu, casually tossing the gory trophy aside. “Next time, pick someone worthwhile.”

The arena erupted. Guan Yu left without a glance.

**City Lord’s Hall**
“It’s time,” Hong Feng declared, watching Guan Yu depart. “Ming. Bring her.”

When summoned, Guan Yu showed no surprise. “What deal?” she demanded, meeting Hong Feng’s gaze unflinchingly.

“We’re alike,” he mused.

“A misfortune,” she retorted.

He smirked. “I’ll free you. In exchange, shatter the Abyss’s seal.”

“Why me?”

“Because you’re my chosen pawn.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. *Pawn? Never.* But she nodded. “Done.”

Hong Feng produced a black vial. “Drink. It nullifies the curse I placed on you… and ensures compliance.”

She gulped it down. Fire and ice ravaged her veins. Hu Xiaohai’s voice echoed worriedly from the whip, but Guan Yu hissed, “I’ll find an antidote. We’re leaving tomorrow.”

**Chapter 1566: The Art of Gu Poison**

Hong Feng applauded as Guan Yu crumpled, her body wracked by alternating agony—flames searing her meridians, frost devouring her bones. A black line surfaced on her middle finger: the Gu’s mark.

“Fool! Why drink it?” Hu Xiaohai raged.

“It was the only way,” she gasped. “I’ll break this poison. Just wait, Akali… I’m coming.”

The next day, Hong Feng led her to the arena. Ming chanted, summoning a vortex of black smoke. Demons writhed as their blood pooled toward a spectral gate. Guan Yu watched, coldly curious.

“Why?” she asked as screams faded.

“Observe.”

When the gate opened, Hong Feng gestured. “Go.”

Guan Yu stepped forward, her resolve unshaken. The path home—and vengeance—lay ahead.
