“What? Such a thing happened? Patriarch Allen shouldn’t be that kind of person, right?” Guan Yu never imagined such history existed between Shituo and Allen, finally understanding his lingering resentment.

“Whether he’s that sort matters not. What I know is his inaction cost hundreds of beastkin lives that day. The disgrace I bore made me exile myself from our tribes – never returning to beastkin territories nor venturing near the Forest of Spirits since.”

“Did Patriarch Allen offer no explanation? Surely he faced constraints. Though clan leader, newly ascended rulers lack authority against senior elders. Such political struggles are natural... There must have been misunderstandings!”

“Spare your defenses. These considerations alone stayed my vengeance. Had no external pressures existed – had his refusal been willful neglect – I’d have slaughtered him where he stood!”

Shituo’s declaration carried iron resolve. Guan Yu sensed the depth of that ancient betrayal – hope’s collapse magnifying despair, compounded by hundreds of lost kin.

“Take heart. I swear Patriarch Allen isn’t ungrateful! Journey to the Forest now. Demand answers – let this festering wound finally heal. Delaying further will only deepen the rift between you.”

As Shituo prepared retort, muffled sobs echoed from the doorway.

Both turned to find Aimee standing there, tears streaming down her cheeks.

“Aimee? How long have you been listening? Did you... hear everything?”

The girl nodded through her tears. “Uncle Shituo... you’ve wronged Father. His refusal... it was because of... because of Mother...”

“Your mother? What of her? Is she well?”

The girl’s grief confirmed Shituo’s dread. Aimee wiped her eyes, voice breaking. “Mother... she’s gone.”

The revelation struck like thunder. As Shituo stood speechless, Guan Yu approached, gently patting her shoulder. “Don’t weep, little one. The departed watch from above – they wish only your happiness. Be strong for her.”

Sniffling, Aimee managed a nod. “I understand, Dragon Clan Brother. I’ll be happy every day!” Comforted, she sat as Guan Yu urged, “Tell us the full story. Only truth can mend these broken bonds.”

“Though young then, I remember clearly. When beastkin clashed with humans, Father prepared reinforcements. But elders opposed him. During their quarrel...” Her breath hitched. “They took Mother hostage. In the struggle, Father slew their ringleader, but Mother... she took a fatal blow shielding him.”

Shituo staggered as if struck. “So this... I wronged him grievously!”

“Father never forgave himself. He blamed his weakness, avoiding you lest memories of Mother’s death resurface.”

Guan Yu’s heart swelled with respect. Such friendship transcended mortal bonds – yet his gaze fell upon motherless Aimee. Her willful nature now made tragic sense – a child raised without maternal guidance, indulged by guilt-ridden father.

“Enough! At dawn, I journey with you!” Shituo’s resolve crystallized. “My brother sacrificed his beloved for my cause – how can I hesitate now?”

Chapter 1309: Until We Meet Again

Dawn found Guan Yu groggily roused by scratching noises. Gray light filtered through windows as he yawned. “Who’s making racket this ungodly hour?”

A head popped through his window. “Wake up! Uncle Shituo says we leave early!”

Guan Yu nearly cursed. Yesterday’s reluctance transformed into predawn urgency – the beastkin’s mercurial temperament truly baffling.

“Tell him I’ll rise... in two hours.”

“But...” Aimee hesitated.

He ruffled her hair. “No ‘buts.’ Off you go. We’ve all day to reach the Forest.”

Before she could move, Shituo’s growl echoed outside. “Enough laziness! Yesterday’s firebrand now sleeps like hibernating bear? Pathetic!”

Guan Yu sprang up, feigning cheer. “Merely teasing Aimee! Ready in three breaths!” True to word, he emerged moments later, impeccably dressed.

“Hmph! Had you not dawdled, we’d be halfway there!” Shituo glared. “Bid farewell to your friends swiftly. Half-hour only!”

As Guan Yu turned, Aimee grabbed his hand. “I’ll accompany Dragon Clan Brother!”

Shituo’s gruff chuckle followed them. “Youth’s vigor... how I envy it.”

At the inn, Huang Wensheng and Xia Tianfeng emerged just as Guan Yu arrived. “Brother Guan! We sought you for farewell drinks!”

“Regretfully, duty calls me away. Our fellowship, though brief, burns bright. In better days, I’ll visit your estates.”

Xia grinned. “Dare I refuse? Yue’er would skin me alive otherwise.” Mention of the fiery girl lifted Guan Yu’s spirits.

As they parted, Huang called, “Where bound, brother?”

Guan Yu removed Aimee’s hood, revealing elven ears. “Now you see. Until fate reunites us!”

The men gaped at the little elf skipping beside Guan Yu. “A... a spiritfolk? What manner of man is he?”

“One best befriended,” Xia murmured. “Apprentice Rong’s days are numbered.”

Chapter 1310: Departure

Approaching the forest by midday, Guan Yu suddenly reined his steed. “Halt! Danger ahead.”

Shituo scoffed. “I sense nothing. Boy cries wolf?”

“Trust me,” Guan Yu insisted. As Aimee added her pleas, the beastkin reluctantly closed his eyes – then stiffened. “By the ancestors... ambush!”

The trio dismounted, tension thickening. Guan Yu’s warning proved true – enemies encircled them, their concealed presence now palpable. Survival demanded cunning... and steel.
