Ling Su somewhat regretted arriving late. Though the town wasn't particularly large, it wasn't small either. Relying solely on himself to search at this hour would undoubtedly prove futile.

Just as Ling Su contemplated giving up, a figure caught his eye - one strikingly similar to Lin Chen. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed him.

Lin Chen had changed into an azure gentleman's robe of exquisite craftsmanship, the fine fabric suggesting considerable expense. Earlier, noticing daylight lingering, he had visited a tailor shop to purchase more affluent-looking attire befitting a romantic rendezvous. However, the chosen garment required alterations for his portly frame, delaying his departure until dusk.

This delay allowed Ling Su to spot Lin Chen passing by the steamed bun shop en route to the southern district. Puzzlingly, despite numerous clothiers along the main thoroughfare, Lin Chen had deliberately chosen an out-of-the-way establishment before circling back past the bun shop - an inexplicable detour.

"Perfect timing," Ling Su thought, trailing discreetly. "Whatever mischief you're plotting ends here."

Lin Chen strode purposefully through thinning crowds as vendors closed stalls. Reaching the southern district, he paused before "Amei Inn" - ostensibly a tavern but primarily functioning as lodgings for travelers. The suggestive name and crimson lanterns promised certain... amenities.

Inside sprawled a bustling hall filled with drinkers. Behind the counter stood two provocatively dressed young women whose revealing attire blurred lines between hospitality and other services. Approaching them, Lin Chen inquired with affected charm, "Is Miss Amei available?"

"Looking for Amei?" One appraised him dismissively. "She's in the Rose Room. Third floor."

The other offered coyly, "Shall I escort you, young master?"

Lin Chen's jowls quivered with glee. "Your enthusiasm is noted," he simpered, "but I'll ascend alone today." Waddling upstairs, he passed doors labeled "Peony Chamber" and "Lotus Suite" before locating his destination.

The mere name "Rose Room" set his palms sweating with anticipation. Visions of Amei's statuesque figure and pearl-like skin danced in his mind - surely tonight would bring amorous conquest!

Outside, Ling Su observed the inn's popularity. Knowing Lin Chen's usual abstention from drink and lodging, he followed inside. Approaching the attendants, he feigned concern: "Pardon, have you seen my friend - about this tall, rather portly?"

"You mean Amei's visitor?" came the noncommittal reply. "We don't disclose guests' whereabouts."

Proffering silver, Ling Su pressed, "It's urgent."

The attendant pocketed the bribe unblushingly. "Our rules forbid it."

Suppressing outrage, Ling Su stalked upstairs. On the third floor, he glimpsed Lin Chen circling confusedly before encountering Amei herself ascending the stairs.

"Apologies for the wait," the innkeeper purred, adjusting her crimson d√©colletage gown. "Those foolish girls misdirected you - the Rose Room's actually on second floor."

As they entered a chamber, Ling Su pressed against the adjacent wall. Within, Amei's coquettish laughter rang out: "Do try our specialty - Rose Fragrance wine. Eight grains aged with rose petals..."

Lin Chen's slurred compliments soon dissolved into drunken ramblings: "Slander! That bastard Ling Su... claiming I have... disease..."

A heavy thud silenced him. Ling Su waited... and waited. No amorous sounds emerged - only eerie stillness.

Steeling himself, Ling Su burst into the room. Lin Chen lay unconscious amidst overturned cups, while Amei calmly sipped wine. "How disappointing," she mused. "The antidote's price just doubled."
