“They will certainly come. In a place like this, the Imperial Guards would never let Marquis Zou slip away. Such a golden opportunity is too rare to miss. We must all remain vigilant and prioritize the Marquis’s safety above all.”

Wang Jun remarked, “The Imperial Guards are led by a centurion with over a hundred men. This number comes from a severely wounded man we captured today, but I find it unreliable. Would the Imperial Guards truly dispatch such a large force?”

**Chapter 4173: Relocation**

“It’s highly possible,” Guan Yu said, leaning forward. “As we draw closer to the capital, factions seeking to harm Marquis Zou will grow bolder. Their greatest fear is his safe arrival.”

If the Imperial Guards indeed attacked with a centurion and a hundred men, repelling them would prove difficult. Guan Yu believed a strategy was urgently needed.

Inside his chamber, Marquis Zou sensed the looming danger. He had summoned both captains to his room, hoping to bolster his security. “Has the third squad’s surveillance been arranged?” he asked.

Zou Wuhui replied, “Twelve men are in the third squad. Their names are recorded, and they’ve been stationed on the second floor. If any attempt to send messages, we’ll know immediately.”

“Guan Yu’s plan is futile,” Zou Wuxiao countered. “Those who leave tonight aren’t necessarily spies. This approach is flawed.”

“The inn is sealed,” the Marquis interjected. “Anyone attempting to leave is suspect. For now, we proceed with caution.”

A knock interrupted them. Guan Yu entered and said coolly, “Your Lordship, I wish to discuss a matter privately. Do you have a moment?”

Though surrounded by trusted aides, Guan Yu’s demeanor suggested secrecy. The Marquis waved everyone out. “Speak freely,” he said once alone.

Guan Yu sat without ceremony. “My lord, I advise you to relocate.”

“Relocate? Is this place unsafe?” the Marquis questioned, puzzled. With guards stationed everywhere, moving seemed riskier.

“The Imperial Guards will strike tonight. A covert relocation would enhance your safety. Traitors lurk among us. If you depart discreetly, even if we fall in battle, they’ll never find you.”

“Covert relocation?” The Marquis hesitated, fearing reduced protection. Safety in numbers felt preferable to stealth.

Guan Yu pressed, “I merely suggest. The choice is yours.”

“How would this work? Do I go alone? Will you accompany me?”

“Wuhui and Wuxiao must attend you. My four men will follow covertly. The captains can manage the defense here. If the Imperial Guards attack, our men can fight or retreat unburdened. Without you present, the enemy will withdraw.”

The logic resonated. With spies in their ranks, the Imperial Guards already knew his location. “A centurion leading over a hundred men would overwhelm us,” Guan Yu added. “Your presence here endangers everyone.”

Relocating preemptively would leave the enemy empty-handed. Lives might be lost, but the Marquis’s survival was paramount.

After deliberation, the Marquis nodded. “Very well. But where shall we go?”

“I anticipated your agreement. Wang Jun scouts nearby inns as we speak. We needn’t go far—just beyond suspicion.”

“Inform me once he finds a place. I’ll prepare.”

**Chapter 4175: A Hurried Departure**

“Notify only Wuhui and Wuxiao. Exclude the captains,” Guan Yu instructed before leaving.

Later, the Marquis donned Wuxiao’s clothes and a bamboo hat. As Wuhui escorted him out, she told the captains, “Guard His Lordship diligently. We’ll return shortly.”

“At your command.”

Wang Jun awaited them at a diagonally opposite inn. After settling the Marquis, he returned. Guan Yu’s group and Wuxiao, now disguised, arrived at the new location. Wuxiao clutched his stomach. “My bowels ache again. I must visit the latrine.”

The man drinking with Wuxiao was none other than Yanzhao, who sought to assassinate the Marquis but repeatedly failed. Enraged, Yanzhao had infected Wuxiao with a blood toxin and kidnapped his family in Liaozhou City. During a drunken encounter, Yanzhao triggered the toxin, then offered an antidote, revealing his control. A jade hairpin—Wuxiao’s wedding gift to his wife—confirmed the threat.

Cornered, Wuxiao betrayed the Marquis to save his family. Yanzhao, shrewdly allying with the Imperial Guards, used Wuxiao’s intelligence. Earlier, Wuxiao’s latrine visit had leaked the Marquis’s location in the second caravan. This time, he signaled the covert relocation, ensuring the Imperial Guards targeted the original inn.

The Imperial Guards, a disciplined hundred-strong force, surrounded the building. Their centurion, masked and sharp-eyed, barked, “Seal all exits! Not a fly escapes!”

Inside, Wuhui panicked. “How did they find us? Who’s the traitor?”

Xiao Zhi urged, “Guan Yu warned us to flee!” Wang Jun agreed. “We must go now!”

“I’ll fetch His Lordship!” Wuhui cried.

“He isn’t here!” Xiao Zhi snapped, dragging her. “Stop shouting! Do you want them to hear?”

Wuhui glared. “Only a few knew of this place. You or Guan Yu must’ve betrayed us!”

“Use your brain!” Xiao Zhi retorted. “If we were traitors, would we stay?”

Wang Jian added, “Who’s missing? Think!”

“Second Brother?” Wuhui whispered, shaking her head. “Impossible! He’d never betray His Lordship…”

“Argue later!” Wang Jun hissed. “We must escape!”

Wuhui rushed to the empty room. “Where is he?!”

“Moved to safety earlier,” Xiao Zhi said. “Now move!”

As they fled through a rear window, the captains at the original inn debated the Imperial Guards’ movements. Wang Jun later regrouped with them. “Prepare for battle. They’ll come here next.”

“Where’s Wuxiao?” Wuhui asked desperately.

“Gone,” the captain replied.

**Chapter 4176: Reasons**

In a secure location, Guan Yu and the Marquis awaited news. “The Imperial Guards targeted the decoy inn,” Guan Yu reported.

The Marquis sighed. “I never imagined my own foster son would betray me. Such sorrow…”

“Perhaps he had reasons,” Guan Yu offered. “Hear him out if he returns.”

“Treason is treason. No excuse suffices.” The Marquis’s face contorted with grief and fury.
