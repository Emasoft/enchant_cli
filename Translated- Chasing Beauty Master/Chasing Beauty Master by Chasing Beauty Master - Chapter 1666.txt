“Moreover, this is the territory bestowed by the Emperor upon Prince Zou as a lifelong fiefdom. Within the walls of Liaozhou City, Prince Zou reigns as its sovereign. Any decree from His Highness holds the weight of imperial edict. Yet Prince Zou governs with benevolence, ensuring peace and order through stringent laws. Transgressors find themselves confined in the dungeons of the princely estate. Over time, Liaozhou has become a haven for the virtuous and a deterrent to the wicked, its people both reverent and awed by Prince Zou’s authority.”

“Upon entering the city, one is greeted by bustling streets rivaling even the Eight Families’ City in splendor. Under Prince Zou’s governance, Liaozhou thrives magnificently. Though it cannot match the Eight Families’ City in population—prosperous due to its proximity to the capital—Liaozhou’s vigor remains undeniable.”

Guan Yu chuckled as they walked, “Luckily, I devised this plan. Otherwise, that fellow Lin Chen would’ve dragged you to search for inns with him.”

“Even if he asked, I’d refuse,” Siqi said dismissively. “I’d never humor his delusions.”

Wang Jun marveled, “Who’d expect such liveliness here? Guan Yu, look at that vendor’s wares—they’re rather eerie.”

Following his gaze, Guan Yu spotted a cart laden with paper effigies, their painted faces hauntingly lifelike. “Where do we find a horse buyer?” Siqi asked.

“We’ll wander a bit,” Guan Yu replied lazily. “Selling them isn’t urgent. We’re merely strolling.”

“But twenty horses could fetch fifty taels!” Aze exclaimed. “That’s no trifling sum!”

Wang Jun laughed. “Fifty taels is a drop in the ocean for Guan Yu. His wealth dwarfs such petty coins.”

Aze, unaware of Guan Yu’s true affluence, pressed, “Is he truly that rich? Show me proof!”

Guan Yu smiled. “Exaggerations. Let’s find a buyer or leave the horses. Either way, I’ll settle with Lin Chen.”

As they bickered, Lin Chen and Ling Su scouted inns. Ling Su glared. “You’ve been deceiving me, Lin Chen. You warned me away from Siqi, yet you cling to her!”

“You’re delusional,” Lin Chen retorted. “Si琪 detests your pestering. I’m merely courteous.”

Their quarrel escalated, insults flying. Ling Su sneered, “You think a toad like you could win her? Dream on!”

Lin Chen, stung by jabs at his stature, shot back, “At least I don’t reek of desperation!”

The feud simmered as they entered a bustling inn doubling as a gambling den. Lured by the clamor, Lin Chen’s eyes gleamed. “A perfect spot—gamble below, rest above. Let’s stay here.”

He booked rooms, frugally pairing occupants. Downstairs, the raucous dice tables beckoned. Lin辰’s fingers itched. “Time to play,” he murmured, drawn to the cacophony of bets and shouts, a shrill-voiced woman dominating the fray.
