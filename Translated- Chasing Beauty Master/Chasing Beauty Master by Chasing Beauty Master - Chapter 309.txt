“Guan Yu’s expression darkened suddenly. A playful impulse surged within him. He strode to Chu Hong and wrapped his arm around her waist, grinning. ‘I choose who to accompany based on their worth. They’re not qualified, but you are!’”

---

Chu Hong’s body tensed abruptly. She glanced at Guan Yu with a coquettish smile, licking her upper lip. “Fine, I’ll take you for the night!”

Guan Yu felt a primal heat rising within him, his throat parched.

---

“This woman still enchants all who see her, as ever!”

Her wine-red, low-cut evening gown revealed a tantalizing expanse of pale skin, the deep valley between her breasts nearly spilling out. The tailored dress clung to her hips, and her delicate feet rested on an exquisite Italian wool rug, inviting fantasies.

---

Every smile, gesture, or glance from Chu Hong could bewitch men. Guan Yu struggled to restrain himself.

---

Chu Hong felt Guan Yu’s breathing grow heavier. With a light laugh, she disentangled herself. “The price for your company is steep. We must address… pressing matters first.”

---

Guan Yu shrugged playfully. “I’m your boss. You work for me, and I pay your wages!” He emphasized “wages” pointedly.

---

“You want me as your secretary?” Chu Hong batted her lashes.

---

“Secretary?” Guan Yu feigned confusion.

---

“Handle business by day, handle the secretary by night!” Chu Hong giggled behind her hand.

---

Guan Yu’s restraint snapped. “So this is why you waited in the office? Let’s not waste time.”

He pulled Chu Hong close, hands roaming freely, crumpling her expensive gown.

---

Chu Hong arched her back, brows furrowed. Memories surfaced—their past adversarial encounters where Guan Yu had seen through her defenses. Now, though resistant, a part of her acknowledged their tangled bond.

---

*Knock. Knock.*

---

“Seems duty calls first,” Chu Hong teased, slipping free as the door opened.

---

Nine people entered—disgruntled clients led by Wu Lan. A tense negotiation ensued until Chu Hong declared: “I am Guan Yu’s woman. *He* owns this club.”

---

Shock rippled through the room. Wu Lan paled, realizing Guan Yu’s formidable reputation. After hasty apologies, the group retreated.

---

Alone again, Guan宇 rose to leave. Chu Hong called out, cheeks flushed. “Have you forgotten something?”

---

“What’s left? I’ve seen everything worth seeing.” He grinned. “Though I’d return if the ‘socialites’ improved.”

---

Chu Hong laughed. “As the boss’s *secretary*, I’ll take note.” Her tone held unspoken promise.

---

Later, as he departed, Guan宇 turned. “When you’re ready to be my woman willingly, I’ll be waiting. That day will come soon.”

---

Chu Hong stood motionless, her icy resolve thawing. Unbeknownst to her, the man had already claimed a part of her heart.

---

That evening, tensions simmered. The card game meant to placate his harem backfired when Feng Xin noticed discrepancies.

---

“Husband, I bought more Victoria’s Secret. Want to see?” Wen Qing purred.

“Yes!” Guan宇 answered reflexively.

---

Feng Xin glared. “If I don’t draw a card tonight, neither can she! Or forget about slacking off later.”

Guan宇 swallowed hard. Feng Xin’s dominance extended even here—her fiery passion both thrilling and dangerous.

---

“Fair? It’s rigged!” Mo Ling accused, crossing her arms.

---

Guan宇 grinned sheepishly. The chaos of his unconventional household continued unabated.
