“Look, Guanyu has already said that this information might very well be false. Therefore, we shouldn’t waste excessive manpower this time,” Chief Zheng reminded. “After all, Kyoto isn’t an easy place for cultivators to operate. It’s better to send only a few people to investigate.”

“No, we must spare no effort. We absolutely cannot let the Demonic Soul Sect obtain the Eight-Drum Technique again. Even if the news is likely fabricated, we must treat it as genuine.”

Xuanming interjected, “Later, when discussing with the elders, we realized that while history records no emperors with suspicious birthdates, this doesn’t negate the possibility. However, a major event once occurred in the martial world that may be connected to this matter.”

“What event?” the group pressed urgently, surprised Xuanming still withheld details at such a critical juncture.

“The elders consulted ancient texts,” Xuanming explained. “Nearly a millennium ago, snow fell in the eighth lunar month. That day resembled the apocalypse—howling winds swept between heaven and earth, temperatures plummeted inexplicably. A scorching summer day turned bitterly cold, with blizzards raging until nightfall.”

“That day coincided with the reigning emperor’s birthday celebration. Court officials braved the storm to gather at the palace, yet the snowfall grew so heavy it nearly entombed the golden halls.”

“No one understood the cause. It seemed Heaven had suddenly chosen to punish mankind. Many believed the end had come, yet such phenomena never recurred. I wonder—could this anomaly have been witnessed by Ancestor Menghua?”

“This theory strains credibility!” Chief Zheng objected. “It reads like a folktale embellished over generations. Moreover, it’s ancient history—impossible to verify. Even if true, how could Ancestor Menghua’s message about an emperor’s birthdate relate to our current sovereign? Determining that long-lost date itself would be impossible!”

“Investigating will prove challenging,” Xuanming conceded, “but we cannot abandon the effort.”

Having exhausted his arguments, Chief Zheng prepared to depart, having no further authority over subsequent plans. Xuanming strode away without regard for others, leaving Chief Lu looking ashen-faced—today’s greatest loser, thoroughly outmaneuvered by Guanyu, who had cunningly claimed several of his treasured artifacts. Though Chief Lu’s heart bled at the loss, he knew reclaiming them from that slippery youth was hopeless. Resigned, he trudged off, consoling himself this counted as “investing in the next generation.”

Locking himself in his study, Xuanming eagerly produced the Dragon Eye Amber. Guanyu’s mention of its immensely powerful artifact spirit had inflamed his curiosity. Examining the extraordinary immortal artifact—a rarity in the martial world—Xuanming marveled. Miao City’s legendary wealth came to mind: the bloodstone conflict between Red Lotus Sect and True Sun Sect, the basketball-sized hematite unprecedented in Jianghu. Such squandered resources! Like Chief Zheng, he resolved to revisit the desert next Seventh Moon, seeking both the Eight-Drum Technique and rare materials to forge mighty magic tools for Yunqing Sect’s ascendancy.

Though Yunqing possessed two immortal artifacts—Submerged Dragon Sword and Merit Cauldron—these sect treasures weren’t personally his. The cauldron remained under elder guardianship; the sword required the sect leader’s token to activate, reserved for existential crises. This amber represented Xuanming’s first personal immortal artifact—a white-grade treasure befitting his status. Imagine wielding both sword and amber in battle!

Calming himself, Xuanming sat cross-legged, clasping the amber. His consciousness suddenly flashed into its inner realm—the same white void Guanyu and Wang Jun had described.

“Another visitor!” a voice rang out as the space constricted to a two-person area. The legless artifact spirit materialized, eyeing Xuanming disdainfully. “An old man? How tedious. Bring back that lively youngster!”

“Are you the artifact spirit?” Xuanming studied the crippled entity, its power unfathomable even to him. “You mean Guanyu?”

“I care not for names. You’re dull company. Leave and fetch him.”

Suppressing irritation, Xuanming pressed on: “I seek to bond as master. As leader of Jianghu’s premier sect, none surpass my strength.”

The spirit laughed. “Arrogant fossil! My former master could crush two of you. Your petty sect leadership impresses none here.”

“You misunderstand,” Xuanming insisted. “Current Jianghu has no stronger candidates. Bonding ensures this treasure’s glory rather than obscurity.”

“Glory with you?” The spirit’s domain violently expanded. “I’d rather sleep eternally than endure your boasting!”

“Consider reality,” Xuanming persisted. “Ancient masters are gone. Without me, you’ll fade into legend. With me, Dragon Eye Amber’s fame will shake the world!”

“Your Jianghu stagnates if you’re its pinnacle.” The spirit yawned. “Wake me when worthy candidates appear.”

Despite Xuanming’s diplomatic efforts, the spirit remained obstinate. “Your posturing insults me. That youth spoke true—Jianghu’s new generation decays. Begone!”

Xuanming’s patience frayed. “We’ve no quarrel. Bonding benefits us both.”

“Benefits?” The spirit sneered. “You presume to own me? This immortal artifact chooses its master—not the reverse. Your paltry power can’t compel me.”

Realizing persuasion had failed, Xuanming’s eyes hardened. “Then I’ll employ… alternative methods.” Energy surged around him—the room’s temperature plummeting as his aura intensified. The spirit finally showed interest, its smirk widening.

“Now this grows mildly entertaining...”
