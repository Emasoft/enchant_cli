“You have better fortune than I do,” Guan Tianze rolled his eyes at Guan Yu. “When I pursued Zhang Xiao back then, it took me years of effort to win her over. But you? You went to the city for barely half a year and brought back such a daughter-in-law for Dad. Who knew you had such luck hidden away?”

“Heh, seems I lacked an eye for beauty,” Guan Yu chuckled, reveling in his good fortune—a habit he dearly loved.

“Now that we’re both settled, Dad wants to tear down our old house and rebuild for good fortune. I agreed, but I’ll cover the costs. Don’t worry about the money—during my time in City N, I seized some opportunities and managed to prosper.” Guan Yu shifted topics abruptly.

“The car you drove back made that clear,” Guan Tian snorted, then sighed. “You’ve outshined me, little brother.”

“Success is relative. If you weren’t capable, how could such a wonderful woman like Sister-in-law Zhang have chosen you?” Guan Yu retorted.

Mentioning Zhang Xiao brought a flicker of pride to Guan Tian’s face. Winning her heart and making her a part of the Guan family remained his proudest achievement.

“I want Dad to stop working at the construction site. He’s been toiling his whole life—I can now provide him comfort. Maybe even bring him to City N,” Guan Yu continued.

Guan Tian nodded, trusting his brother implicitly. Though Guan Yu had only returned with a car, Guan Tian believed in his sibling’s capabilities without reservation—such was their bond.

Guan Tian’s expression turned grim. “I’ve thought about easing Dad’s burdens too. He agreed to retire after finishing this final project. But he’s loyal to the crew that fed our family for years. He’ll leave only after this job ends—on the fourth day of the new year.”

Guan Yu respected his father’s decision.

On the fourth day, Guan Zhongfu returned to the construction site for his last job.

On the fifth day, news arrived: Guan Zhongfu had fallen fifteen meters during high-altitude work.

Chapter 699: Fury

Guan Zhongfu lived by gratitude and loyalty.

With both sons successful—Guan Tian as a civil servant and Guan Yu driving a luxury car—life seemed bright. Guan Yu spun tales of机遇 (opportunities) in City N, though his explanations felt thin. Liu Shilei reluctantly corroborated his lies to protect Guan Zhongfu from the truth of his dangerous life.

But tragedy struck. Despite surviving the fall, Guan Zhongfu faced blindness and paralysis from brain hemorrhages and spinal injuries. Doctors warned of lifelong disability.

Fury ignited in Guan Yu. Investigating the accident revealed negligence: shoddy safety measures by profit-driven contractors. Outraged, he vowed justice.

Using his healing system, Guan宇 assessed the severe injuries—displaced organs, broken ribs, cranial trauma. Doctors deemed surgery too risky, but inaction meant blindness and paralysis.

“I’ve studied medicine in City N. Let me treat Dad,” Guan宇 insisted.

Skeptical but desperate, Guan Tian relented. Removing the oxygen mask and bandages, Guan宇 channeled his治疗系统 (healing system), focusing on dispersing淤血 (hematomas) and repairing the spine.

But a doctor’s shout interrupted: “This is reckless!”

Chapter 700: No Time for Lectures

The doctor stormed in, outraged. “You’re endangering the patient!”

Guan宇 met his glare calmly. “I know the risks. Step aside—I’ve no time for lectures.”

Ignoring protests, he placed hands on his father,电流 (currents) flowing through his治疗系统. The room buzzed with unseen energy as he worked meticulously, determined to restore his father’s health and seek retribution against those responsible.
