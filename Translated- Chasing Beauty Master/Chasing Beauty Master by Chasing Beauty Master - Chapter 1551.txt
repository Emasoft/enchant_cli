Guan Yu gazed at Prince Zou, forcing a strained smile. At this juncture, Prince Zou had no choice but to pin his hopes on Guan Yu and his two companions—otherwise, fear might have compelled him to remain sequestered here indefinitely.

Zou Wuxiao was utterly useless. The man became so addled by drink that he scarcely recognized himself. Even if aware the wine were poisoned, he would drain it without hesitation. Thus, Prince Zou knew better than to rely on him.

As for Zou Wuhui, though shrewd and clear-minded, her capabilities had seen little improvement over the years. Against two skilled adversaries, she would be swiftly overwhelmed.

The three remaining captains were even less competent than Zou Wuhui. Though Magistrate Mao had assigned a platoon of soldiers to escort Prince Zou, their presence offered scant protection.

Thus, Prince Zou concluded that his survival hinged entirely on Guan Yu’s trio. Their full abilities remained obscured, but their displayed prowess—particularly Guan Yu’s devastating internal energy slash earlier—marked them as extraordinary. Prince Zou suspected them to be cultivators, their arcane arts forming an impregnable shield if properly utilized.

The journey’s route had been meticulously planned. By tomorrow’s departure, they would reach Ao Tian Manor—a day’s travel away. Initially, Prince Zou had considered sending envoys ahead, but fearing assassins lurked everywhere, he abandoned the idea.

Wang Jun whispered to Xiao Zhi, “What of Du Bingyan? We leave tomorrow. How will you settle her?”

“I’ve given her gold to wait here,” Xiao Zhi replied, loud enough for Prince Zou to overhear. “Once we safely deliver His Highness to the capital, I’ll return for her.”

Prince Zou’s ears pricked at this. Though still wary of their motives, their consistent protection had begun to erode his suspicions. He resolved to test whether their techniques truly belonged to the Yunqing Sect.

“Xiao Zhi,” Prince Zou interjected, “I hear your beloved recently lost her parents?”

Xiao Zhi, surprised by the prince’s knowledge, bowed. “Indeed, Your Highness. She is now alone in the world.”

**Chapter 4022: A Request**

“How tragic,” Prince Zou murmured. “Magistrate Mao shall care for her in your absence. Would that suffice?”

“This humble official would be honored,” Magistrate Mao swiftly assented, recognizing an opportunity to curry favor.

“Have her reside in the City Lord’s Manor,” Prince Zou continued. “Safety and comfort shall be guaranteed.”

Xiao Zhi’s eyes brightened. “Your generosity astounds me. But might this burden Magistrate Mao?”

“No trouble at all!” the magistrate protested. “My home is vast, and your friend shall want for nothing.”

Wang Jun clapped Xiao Zhi’s shoulder. “See? She’ll live like nobility here.”

Yet Prince Zou’s benevolence concealed darker designs—by hosting Du Bingyan, he gained leverage over Xiao Zhi. Should betrayal arise, her life would become bargaining chip.

Xiao Zhi, oblivious to this stratagem, pressed further: “Your Highness, I’ve another request. Could Magistrate Mao fetch her in two days, after funeral rites conclude?”

“Consider it done,” Magistrate Mao vowed. “I’ll send word once she’s settled.”

**Chapter 4023: Divergent Methods**

As night fell, the trio convened in Guan Yu’s chamber.

“Does the prince truly trust us now?” Wang Jun wondered aloud.

“He clings to Zou Wuhui and that drunkard Wuxiao,” Guan Yu countered. “Our three rescues merely make us useful tools.” He revealed his earlier foreknowledge of the assassination attempt: “I waited to intercept the dagger precisely when trust hung in balance.”

Xiao Zhi gaped. “You knew? Why not warn him?”

“And risk error?” Guan Yu’s smile was razor-thin. “One misstep and we’d lose what little credibility we’ve earned.”

Wang Jun grasped the implication: “By saving him at the lethal moment, you deepened his dependence.”

Nodding, Guan Yu dissected the prince’s machinations—the “kindness” toward Du Bingyan being mere hostage-taking. Yet he advised compliance: “Refusal now would heighten suspicion. Magistrate Mao’s reach ensures she’s already within their grasp.”

**Chapter 4024: The Journey Resumes**

Dawn unveiled thirty soldiers and an ornate carriage awaiting Prince Zou. Magistrate Mao bowed deeply. “May Your Highness travel safely. Command me if further needs arise.”

As the entourage departed, Guan Yu’s group maintained vigilant masks. The prince’s feigned camaraderie couldn’t obscure the truth—they danced on a knife’s edge, where one misstep might doom both protectors and protected. Yet in this deadly waltz, Guan Yu’s calculations ran deeper still, his true designs as veiled as the mists shrouding distant cultivation peaks.
