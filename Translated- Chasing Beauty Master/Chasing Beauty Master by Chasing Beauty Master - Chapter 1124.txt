“I’m not interested in treasure maps. Those things are ticking time bombs that could explode at any moment. I don’t want to be watched like prey everywhere I go. Look at Bill Lynn now—wherever he goes, he needs bodyguards trailing him. It’s terribly inconvenient,” Guan Yu explained.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-Six: Hospitality**

Second to Wolf chimed in, “Exactly. Think about how much money he spent buying those treasure maps. Now they’re just sitting at home, utterly useless. He hardly dares step outside because so many people want to target him. Everyone’s waiting for an opportunity. Can you blame them? Those maps of his are practically legendary.”

Qi Zhi nodded. “Treasure maps are truly valuable things. I’d love to get my hands on one too, but I lack the funds. I can only dream. Still, if even Bill Lynn fears being targeted, it shows that while treasure maps are priceless, their risks are immense. Without power or backing, owning one could get you killed.”

“Not necessarily,” Guan Yu countered. “Take Mr. Wu, the owner of Jinxin Pawnshop. He acquired a treasure map and has been perfectly fine so far.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-Seven: Making a Fuss**

“Ah, that’s just luck!” Second to Wolf exclaimed. “Who’d have thought a farmer would stumble upon a treasure map and sell it to Jinxin Pawnshop for a mere 1.5 million? Mr. Wu must’ve struck gold overnight. When Hou Jinshun and I visited the pawnshop, the owner seemed decent enough. I saw the map myself, but couldn’t verify its authenticity. When Mr. Wu quoted 20 million, I had to walk away.”

Guan Yu pressed, “I heard about this. Hou Jinshun mentioned your friend wanted to buy it. Did he succeed?”

“Not yet. My friend’s in the car business. After hearing about the map, he’s been pestering me for details. He knows it’s valuable but risky.”

Qi Zhi poured wine for everyone and raised his glass. “Come, brothers, let’s drink!”

After they drank, Qi Zhi chuckled, “I knew if Brother Guan Yu was here, Old Hou would bring out the good stuff. Next time, I’ll call you first—free premium wine!”

Second to Wolf boasted, “Of course! This club belongs to the Yang Family, and Guan Yu’s their son-in-law. Naturally, they’d serve him the finest.”

In truth, Guan Yu never paid here. Yang Conghan had long instructed that his visits be complimentary. Hou Jinshun, the manager, always rolled out red carpets with gourmet meals and imported wines. Whenever Guan Yu arrived, Hou would produce top-shelf liquor and join them for drinks. Any leftovers after Guan Yu left usually ended up in Hou’s private stash—a minor indulgence Yang Conghan tolerated, valuing Hou’s managerial skills over petty accounting.

Hou Jinshun had managed Midnight Blossom Club for years, seamlessly handling all operations and befriending staff and regulars alike. Replacing him would be disastrous. While other employees like Ling’er received modest raises, Yang Conghan discreetly increased Hou’s salary twice this year. Consequently, Hou treated the club as his home, working from dawn till midnight, rarely leaving unless Guan Yu required assistance.

“Hou Jinshun serves me good wine on orders—it’s not his money anyway,” Guan Yu remarked lightly.

Qi Zhi grinned. “Drinking with you is a privilege—free top-tier liquor! But back to treasure maps. Didn’t you take photos at the pawnshop? Any chance I could see them?”

The question was perfectly timed—casual yet probing.

“Ah, sorry! I deleted those photos,” Qi Zhi shrugged, fiddling with his phone. “Since I couldn’t afford 20 million, keeping them seemed pointless. But we could visit Mr. Wu later if you’re curious.”

Guan Yu waved it off. “Just a passing whim.”

Qi Zhi snorted, “That farmer was a fool! Selling the map for peanuts at a pawnshop instead of bringing it here. Had I met him, I’d have offered millions more.”

Second to Wolf added, “He thought the antique box was valuable, not the map inside. Clueless!”

“Exactly!” Qi Zhi agreed. “But Mr. Wu’s luck won’t last. After two days, he’ll have to lower the price.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-Eight: The Fake**

“Why?” Guan Yu asked.

“Simple. The farmer blabbed while drunk—now everyone knows Mr. Wu has a cheaply acquired treasure map. Desperate buyers will swarm him. He’ll panic-sell soon.”

Guan Yu countered, “Your intel’s outdated. Mr. Wu already sold it.”

“What?!” Qi Zhi choked on his wine. “For how much?!”

“Sixty-six million,” Second to Wolf deadpanned. “Bill Lynn bought it two hours ago.”

Qi Zhi gaped. “Sixty-six million?! Who’d be that insane?!”

Guan Yu confirmed, “True. Check with Mr. Wu yourself.”

“Bill Lynn’s swimming in cash! But why overpay?!”

Second to Wolf smirked. “Bad timing—he competed with the Yang Family. Bidding war.”

Qi Zhi laughed. “Bet Bill Lynn’s face was priceless! Only the Yangs could push him that high.”

Guan Yu mused, “Had Bill Lynn not bought it, your friend might’ve had a chance.”

Qi Zhi shook his head. “The Yangs would’ve snatched it anyway. Though honestly, these maps are overhyped. Even if real, gathering all fragments is impossible. Only rich fools believe in phantom treasures.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “You think they’re fake?”

“Of course! Who verified these ‘treasures’? The whole craze started after rumors spread. For all we know, it’s an elaborate hoax.”

Unbeknownst to Qi Zhi, Guan Yu had engineered the counterfeit maps to divert danger. When pressured by martial artists like Yingshangu and Feitian Lang, he’d planted fragments to satisfy their greed. Now, with Bill Lynn and others chasing illusions, Guan Yu could finally breathe—his ruse had worked perfectly.

As the wine flowed, Guan Yu hid a smile. Let the wealthy play their expensive game. The real treasure was surviving it all.
