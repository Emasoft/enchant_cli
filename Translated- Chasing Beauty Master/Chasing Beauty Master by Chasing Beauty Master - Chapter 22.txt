Gritting her teeth, Du Xiaojuan saw Zhao Xu preparing to pounce and drag her down. Without hesitation, she leaped through the window!

"Better dead than defiled by these scoundrels!" she thought desperately, eyes tightly shut as wind roared past her ears. Her heart lodged in her throat during those fleeting seconds of freefall from the fourth floor—seconds that stretched into an eternity of flashing regrets. She'd never experienced love, had only shared her first kiss with Guan Yu today. If only she'd given herself to him properly instead of meeting this wretched end!

Guan Yu's head snapped up as he sprinted toward the guesthouse. His heart plummeted when he saw Xiaojuan's figure in the window. "Don't jump!" he tried to scream, but her body was already plummeting.

Blood rushed to his eyes as adrenaline surged. Ten meters separated him from her trajectory. With every ounce of strength amplified by his Gravity Technique's weight reduction, Guan Yu shot forward like a loosed arrow. A golden flash erupted in his mind—*Ding... Gravity Technique upgraded...*—but he had no time to process it.

Spreading his arms beneath the falling girl, Guan Yu watched her descend like a comet. At the last moment, Xiaojuan opened her eyes—not to a final glimpse of the world, but to Guan Yu's crimson, vein-popping face contorted with fury and desperation.

"Fool! Move!" she tried to scream as her waist and neck collided with his arms. Before impact, Guan Yu activated his enhanced Gravity Technique on her body. Though reduced, the hundred-jin weight's momentum still hammered his arms like a freight train. He dropped into horse stance, hands cushioning the blow as his elbows cracked against pavement.

Xiaojuan stared dazedly at her savior. Alive! Yet searing pain pinned her to the ground. Bystanders gaped—this youth had caught a falling person bare-handed!

Kneeling with ruined arms, Guan Yu glared up at Wang Fubin and Zhao Xu in the window. Fresh blood dripped from his mangled hands. "Hold me!" he growled through clenched teeth. Though rage burned to dismember them, reason prevailed—injured and outnumbered against armed foes, retreat was their only option.

"Don't let them escape!" Wang Fubin's roar spurred the van drivers into action. Guan Yu scooped Xiaojuan up, the upgraded Gravity Technique lending ethereal lightness to their bodies. He cleared half-meter hedges like hurdles, scaled three-meter garage walls with rooftop sprints, vanishing into residential alleys as their pursuers stared slack-jawed.

"Martial arts master?" Zhao Xu spat incredulously, stomping his foot. The girl's suicidal defiance left him shaken—had she died, their gang's female leader would've flayed them alive. This "chivalrous" underworld code made villainy downright inconvenient.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu collapsed onto a park bench miles away, chest heaving. Xiaojuan whimpered as she tried sitting up. "I'm sorry this happened because of me," he murmured, guilt twisting at her swollen cheek.

She stared silently until he tried standing. "Where are you going?" she panicked, clutching his sleeve.

"To the bathroom."

"I'll come!" She scrambled up, shadowing him to the restroom door like a lost kitten. Two hours and multiple Healing Technique applications later, Guan Yu's hands scabbed over miraculously.

As dusk fell, he suggested returning to campus. Xiaojuan shook her head violently. "My aunt's coming—she's a police officer with a gun!" True to word, rhythmic knocking soon announced their salvation.

"Juanjuan! Open up!" called a melodic voice.

"It's Auntie!" Xiaojuan brightened, still clinging to Guan Yu's arm.

"You should greet her..." he hinted awkwardly.

She released him with reluctant slowness. When the door opened, a sharp-eyed policewoman took in the bloodstained youth and her niece's death grip on his shirt. Her raised eyebrow spoke volumes.
