“By the way, what were you saying earlier about dual cultivation of magic and martial arts? Can I try it? How do I know if I have that ability?” Zhao Xue suddenly remembered to ask.

Wang Jun chuckled, “You’re truly full of whimsical ideas. Dual cultivation of magic and martial arts? That’s no simple feat. It’s a rarity seen once in a millennium. Ordinary people lack such fortune, but you’re lucky—”

“Ahem!” Guan Yu coughed forcefully, cutting off Wang Jun’s words. This fellow was clearly about to expose Guan Yu as one of those legendary dual cultivators.

Guan Yu wanted no additional trouble. Wang Jun’s loose tongue was truly exasperating. After being interrupted, Wang Jun finally realized his blunder and promptly fell silent.

“What’s wrong? Why did you stop him, Guan Yu?” Zhao Xue asked curiously, sensing his deliberate interference.

Her aristocratic temper flared as she pressed, “What are you hiding? I consider you friends, yet you keep secrets from me! What did he mean by ‘lucky’? Continue!”

Wang Jun glanced helplessly at Guan Yu, who sighed deeper. A’ze, ever the mediator, nudged, “Guan Yu, you should take pride in this. What’s the use of hiding it? Look how anxious she’s become.”

Indeed, Zhao Xue had risen to her feet. “Exactly! Speak already! Is there a way for me to learn magic? Please help me!”

Wang Jun threw caution aside. “Your ‘luck’ isn’t about learning magic yourself. It’s that standing before you is the legendary dual cultivator himself. Guess which of us it is!”

“It must be Guan Yu,” Zhao Xue declared without hesitation, crushing Wang Jun and A’ze’s hopes. They gaped at her confident accuracy.

“How did you know?” Wang Jun sputtered.

“Isn’t it obvious?” Zhao Xue analyzed: “A’ze? No. This elegant lady here? Unlikely. You? Even less so. Guan Yu clearly leads your group and carries an exceptional aura. It has to be him.”

“Your praise honors me, Miss Zhao,” Guan Yu replied courteously. “I only gained this ability through extraordinary circumstances.”

“Circumstances? What circumstances? Tell me everything!”

Zhao Xue’s relentless curiosity cornered Guan Yu again. She resembled an insatiable child, demanding full understanding of every detail.

Guan Yu grimaced, struggling to explain coherently. “Let me first explain dual cultivation. Conceptually, it’s simple—simultaneously harboring inner qi and spiritual energy within one’s body. Normally impossible, yet achievable for dual cultivators.”

**Chapter 4406: No Solution**

“But my inner qi is still minimal,” Zhao Xue tilted her head. “Does that mean I can’t learn magic either? I only developed this qi through arduous cultivation over the past year.”

A’ze suggested, “Couldn’t we let her attempt spellcraft? Surely there’s no harm?”

“Great harm,” Guan Yu countered. “Reckless attempts could destabilize her qi or induce spiritual backlash. I advise against such dangerous experiments.”

Zhao Xue’s eyes sparkled. “Then how did you succeed? Can you teach me?”

“I cannot teach what I don’t understand myself. If you insist on trying, I’ll assist—but cautiously.”

“What if you purge my qi? Then I could learn magic!”

“I lack that power. At most, I’ll share basic incantations. But you mustn’t rush. Impatience invites disaster.”

Relieved, Zhao Xue smiled. “Then instruct me now. Do I need special tools?”

“Fetch ink and paper.”

Guan Yu transcribed verses and handed them over. “Meditate on these foundational mantras. Test if conflicts arise.”

Obediently clutching the paper, Zhao Xue worried, “Will this kill me?”

“No. I’ll guard you. Stay calm.”

Sitting cross-legged, Zhao Xue recited the verses with intense focus—once, twice...

*Splat!* Blood suddenly sprayed from her lips. The group startled as Guan Yu urgently commanded, “Stop! This path is closed to you.”

**Chapter 4407: Recklessness**

Zhao Xue paled ghastly upon awakening. “It’s impossible... The energy repelled at my dantian. Agonizing.”

Guan Yu marveled inwardly—her talent was extraordinary. Had she not cultivated qi first, she’d have been a prodigious mage.

“Now you see: qi and magic cannot coexist. Your experiment proves it.”

“But I’m fascinated by magic! Isn’t there another way?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Had you come before developing qi, yes. Now? Even abandoning your cultivation won’t help.”

“I’ll discard my qi!”

“Too perilous. Persist with qi cultivation—you’ll become a master.”

A maidservant’s shriek interrupted them. “Miss! You’re bleeding!”

“Cease your dramatics! I’ll live,” Zhao Xue rasped weakly before dismissing the servant.

Guan Yu rose. “We’ll take our leave. Rest and recover.”

“Nonsense! You’ll dine here,” Zhao Xue insisted, standing shakily. “I’ve much more to请教.”

Over dinner, Zhao Xue grilled Guan Yu relentlessly about cultivation techniques. Even Wang Jun and A’ze gained insights from his patient explanations.

Meanwhile, Lin Chen returned disheveled to Yunqing Sect. Confronted by Elder Lu, he spun lies: “Ling Su gambled away our funds! Guan Yu sent me for reinforcements.”

Elder Lu frowned. “The gold was Guan Yu’s responsibility. How could Ling Su steal it?”

“I—as deputy leader—managed the treasury. Ling Su stole it while I slept!”

Skeptical but constrained, Elder Lu directed him to Sect Leader Xuan Ming, who declared: “Recall Ling Su for punishment!”

Lin Chen panicked inwardly—how to frame Ling Su further? Yet he pressed on: “Let Ling Su redeem himself by securing the Eight Drums Manual in Miao City.”

Xuan Ming sighed. “His arrogance crosses limits. Should he jeopardize our mission, expulsion awaits.”

**Chapter 4408: Contempt**

Lin Chen continued his deceit: “Guan Yu already reprimanded him. We need funds to resume our journey.”

Every word flowed smoothly, painting Ling Su as the sole culprit. Had the true gambler heard this slander, murderous rage would’ve ensued.

Thus, Lin Chen’s web of lies held—for now.
