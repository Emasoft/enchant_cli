“Alright, I’ll attend to official matters first. We’ll catch up later.” Guan Yu said, holding the documents and seal as he entered the room where the Fang Family Patriarch was detained.

Chapter Two Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine: Pleasant Journey

Guan Yu slammed the documents onto the table before the Fang Family Patriarch. “You’ve really done your share of wicked deeds. I’m almost reluctant to spare your life. People like you are nothing but a scourge on this world.” He began with a few threatening words.

“Guan Yu, you can’t go back on your word! Integrity matters. If you flip-flop like this, how are you any different from the likes of us?” The Fang Family Patriarch stammered, guessing Guan Yu must have reviewed the files to speak this way.

In truth, Guan Yu hadn’t examined the documents—he’d only come to intimidate. Yet his hunch proved correct: a thorough investigation would surely reveal nothing savory.

“Fine. I won’t stoop to your level or break my promise. Sign these papers and fingerprint them. Afterward, I’ll have you sent abroad. Let’s hope we never meet again.” Guan Yu spoke with forced benevolence. This wasn’t entirely a deception; he did intend to exile them overseas—though their destination remained undisclosed.

The Fang Family Patriarch gritted his teeth. Resistance was futile now. Guan Yu’s current civility would vanish at the first sign of defiance.

Forced to sign and fingerprint, the patriarch understood the stakes. Who would willingly surrender a lifetime’s accumulated wealth? The agony of loss twisted like a blade in his chest.

“Hurry up. I’ve no patience for delays. Need I remind you this signature isn’t strictly necessary?” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy as the patriarch hesitated.

Trembling, the man picked up the discarded pen and scrawled his name across each document. Guan Yu watched closely, wary of tricks.

Finally, fingerprints were added. Though legally redundant after signatures, they bolstered the papers’ authority.

“Well done.” Guan Yu nodded. “From this moment, everything belonging to the Fang family is mine. May our paths never cross again. Pleasant journey.”

Rising, he signaled Jia Bo and Wang Hu. “Both of you—come with me.”

Outside, Guan Yu retrieved a dossier from the table. “These contain the passports, identification, and flight tickets for Fang Su and his father. The plane departs at three. Escort them to the airport now.”

Jia Bo accepted the folder. “Two hours should suffice. We’ll leave immediately.”

“Wait.” Guan Yu stopped them. “Leave your firearms here—they’ll cause trouble at security. Unshackle them before the terminal to avoid suspicion.”

Wang Hu frowned. “But without restraints, they might flee. The airport’s crowded, and with police around—”

“Let them run if they dare.” Guan Yu interrupted. “If they choose to stay in China, they choose death. Your duty ends at delivering them to the airport.”

Reentering the room, Jia Bo announced, “Time to go.” He hauled Fang Su upright while Wang Hu pulled the patriarch to his feet.

Passing through the lobby where Guan Yu and Xue Jing stood watching, Jia Bo sneered at Fang Su: “Look at the mighty young master now. This is the price of opposing our boss.”

Guan Yu called after them, “Jia Bo—give them ten thousand yuan for initial expenses abroad.”

As Jia Bo nodded, Fang Su blurted, “Where are you sending us?”

“Check your tickets at the airport.” Guan Yu’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “You’ll be met upon arrival. The climate may take getting used to, but you’ll adapt. Beyond survival, your future is your own concern.”

His unspoken threat hung heavy: remaining in China meant forfeiting their lives.

The intended destination—a destitute microstate plagued by disease and extreme heat—remained unmentioned. With no outward transportation, they’d be driven hours from a neighboring country’s airport to their final hellscape. Survival there? A matter of fate.

With the Fangs expelled, Guan Yu ordered the mansion purged of valuables, tasking Wei Hongwei with the sweep.

“All spoils belong to the faction. Anyone caught hoarding will be exiled from the Yu Faction and punished severely. No exceptions.”

Departing, Guan Yu drove to Qiaoyuan District to fetch Lü Mei. Visiting her mother Yao Yu at the Lü estate required decorum—and gifts. Bringing Lü Mei also preempted gossip about arriving with only Xue Jing.

“You’re negotiating business with my mom? Seriously?” Lü Mei gaped, turning from her computer.

“Dead serious. You’ve half an hour to prepare.” Guan Yu grinned.

Pouting, she conceded, “I haven’t been home in ages. Fine!”

Though forbidden from casual outings due to dangers, Lü Mei enjoyed frequent guarded visits from family steward Wang Shu. Now, hastily swapping pajamas for a pink crop top and distressed denim shorts, she emerged barefoot, white socks peeking under black flats.

“Speedy as ever.” Xue Jing remarked.

“Mom won’t care.” Lü Mei shrugged, exchanging socks for shoes at the entrance.

En route, Guan Yu pondered, “What gift for Yao Yu? Can’t arrive empty-handed.”

“She has everything.” Lü Mei waved dismissively. “Just pick something expensive.”

Xue Jing teased, “Rich girl—don’t you know your mother’s preferences?”

Guilt flickered across Lü Mei’s face. “She… always knows mine.”

Lightening the mood, Guan Yu joked, “How about a man? A widow might appreciate—”

“YOU JERK!” Lü Mei lunged from the backseat, throttling him as the car swerved.

“I’m driving!” Guan Yu choked out between laughs, wrestling the steering wheel straight.

The car fishtailed wildly before stabilizing. Lü Mei released her grip, sulking as Guan Yu gasped, “Trying to kill us all?”

Xue Jing dissolved into laughter. “Never dull with you two!”

Pouting, Lü Mei crossed her arms. “Don’t you dare disrespect Mom again!”

“Noted.” Guan Yu chuckled, adjusting the rearview mirror. “Now let’s find that gift—preferably one that won’t get me strangled.”

As the trio continued, the unresolved tension of exile plots and family dynamics hummed beneath their banter—a momentary lull before looming storms.
