**Chapter 4528: Killing Without Mercy**

The Heterodox Sect members acted shrewdly, scattering across the battlefield. Groups of them encircled Ha Tribe warriors, attacking with long spears specifically designed to counter the tribe’s close-combat prowess. They inflicted gradual injuries, whittling down their opponents one by one.

Without such tactics, the Ha Tribe warriors’ overwhelming strength would have been unstoppable. A single close encounter could send foes flying.

Even so, two hundred Ha Tribe warriors proved too much for the Heterodox Sect to handle—especially now that their cultivators’ spells had been neutralized.

“Switch to single-target spells!” Xiao Mei ordered after her two area spells failed. She focused on picking off individual Ha Tribe warriors with precise magical strikes.

As the enemy cultivators launched their focused attacks, Guan Yu’s allies began casting protective shields over the Ha warriors. Each shattered barrier was immediately renewed.

Guan Yu observed nearly thirty enemy cultivators. For a desert faction to command such loyalty spoke volumes about their leader’s prowess.

“Siqi, don’t you know a lightning-based spell?” Guan Yu asked. “One that doesn’t kill but numbs its victims like an electric shock, leaving them paralyzed as if drugged?”

Siqi nodded, though she winced at Guan Yu’s renaming of her technique.

“Why not try that spell on Xiao Mei?” he pressed.

“Impossible,” Siqi shook her head. “The current would spread through conductive materials. With so many hostages near her, collateral harm is inevitable.”

“Let it spread!” Guan Yu countered. “The shock won’t kill—just incapacitate. Once they’re all stunned, our spells can work freely.”

Siqi hesitated, unwilling to risk children’s lives. Relenting, Guan Yu abandoned the idea, opting instead for direct spell clashes. Admittedly, his own magical prowess paled beside Siqi’s.

As Guan Yu pondered, Xiao Mei began chanting anew. “Siqi,” he warned, “her next spell targets a warrior. Reinforce their shield the moment she attacks.”

“Understood. I’ll watch closely,” Siqi vowed.

Guan Yu raised his Soulfall Blade, preparing his first proper spell in ages—a single-target assault from the relic weapon. The blade whirled in his hands as he muttered incantations, then suddenly—

**CRASH!** A colossal sword materialized above Xiao Mei, smashing down before she could react. The strike threw her from her palanquin, scattering her bearers.

The display left Guan Yu’s allies gaping. None could match such potent single-target magic. Wang Jun blurted, “What spell was that? I’ve never seen its like!”

“Necessity breeds innovation,” Guan Yu shrugged. “With hostages present, lightning spells were too dangerous. This alternative sufficed.”

Xiao Mei rose, disheveled but unharmed. “Sneak attacking me? Fine!” She seized a hostage, snapping their neck. “Let’s see you stop this!”

Helpless, Guan Yu watched the brutality unfold. Such wanton slaughter couldn’t be tolerated. “Coward!” he roared. “Fight me alone! If I win, release the hostages. If I lose, we’re yours to command!”

Xiao Mei appraised the white-robed youth—a vision of heroic charm that made her pulse quicken. “Very well,” she purred. “Dawn tomorrow. Today, I’ll free half the hostages. Win then, and I’ll release the rest. Lose, and you’re mine.”

“Agreed.” Guan Yu’s reply drew protests from Siqi and allies fearing traps, but he remained resolute. “Trust me. I’ve outwitted Cloudgreen Sect’s elders—a desert upstart won’t best me.”

As half the hostages stumbled home, their gratitude flowed only to Ha chieftain Ma Zhagen, ignoring Guan Yu’s impending duel.

**Chapter 4529: A Cup of Tea**

At dawn, Guan Yu approached the Heterodox stronghold. Instead of immediate combat, an envoy greeted him: “Our教主 invites you to tea.”

Intrigued, Guan Yu entered a lavish tent where Xiao Mei lounged in scarlet silks, barefoot and barely dressed. “Welcome, pretty one,” she cooed, adjusting his collar. “Why aid those brutes?”

Guan Yu’s hands wandered as freely as his words. “I seek information about Miao City.”

“Ah, the Eight-Sided Drum technique.” She poured tea, her scent intoxicating. “Many have died pursuing that.”

As Guan Yu drank, Xiao Mei settled in his lap. “Men should sample all beauties,” she murmured. “Why limit yourself to that icy companion?”

“Variety spices life,” he agreed, fingers tracing her curves. “But my interest in you isn’t carnal. Tell me of Miao City’s defenses.”

Her laughter tinkled. “So bold! But first—” She kissed him, poison on her lips. Guan Yu staggered, feigning collapse.

“Fool!” Xiao Mei sneered. “Now you’ll lead me to the Drum technique’s location!”

**Chapter 4530: Feigned Weakness**

Guan Yu’s body convulsed convincingly. As Heterodox members bound him, he mentally cataloged their numbers. Let them think him helpless—the trap would soon reverse.

When alone, he dissolved the fake toxin. Tonight, while Xiao Mei gloated, he’d free the hostages and dismantle her sect from within. The real game had just begun.
