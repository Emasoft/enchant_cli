The Left Envoy casually beckoned to Wang Jun, intending to have him approach to inquire about Guan Yu's whereabouts, since they were both from the Cloud Azure Sect and should have arrived together this time.

Upon clearly seeing Wang Jun's face, Wang Xiaorong immediately recalled him—they had met before, and she'd also seen him during her previous encounter with Guan Yu in the Cloud Azure Sect's forest.

Though the Left Envoy could wait patiently, Wang Xiaorong could no longer contain her urgency. She longed to see Guan Yu this very instant.

“You came with Guan Yu, didn’t you? Take me to him now.” Without wasting a single word on pleasantries, Wang Xiaorong strode forward and pointed directly at Wang Jun’s nose.

Wang Jun glanced at the Left Envoy. As the latter’s subordinate, he awaited his superior’s nod of approval. Once granted, he replied, “Please follow me, Young Mistress. Guan Yu is resting at the inn across the street.”

“Elder Brother Left Envoy, there’s no need for you to accompany me. Go report to the outpost first. I’ll be perfectly safe.” With that, Wang Xiaorong took the lead toward the inn.

The Left Envoy calmly instructed, “Remember—you must ensure the Young Mistress’s safety at all costs.”

“Understood.” Wang Jun bowed and hurried ahead to guide her.

The sudden arrival of Wang Xiaorong and the Left Envoy startled the outpost’s manager, who feared some major incident had occurred. Normally, high-ranking figures like them would have sent advance notice for preparations, yet this time no warning had come, leaving everyone tense.

After entering the teahouse, the Left Envoy ordered, “Close the doors. No more customers today.”

Two attendants promptly cleared the remaining patrons. This teahouse served as the Demon Soul Sect’s primary outpost in Zhouji City.

One of the Demon Soul Sect’s strengths lay in its vast network—nearly every region in the martial world hosted their outposts, each managed by an Incense Master with six to seven subordinates. Remote areas like this maintained smaller outposts, while larger cities might have multiple branch altars staffed by dozens of disciples under a Hall Master.

In contrast, the Cloud Azure Sect kept to itself, seldom intervening in external conflicts unless critical news eventually trickled in through delayed and fragmented reports. The sect’s lack of dedicated intelligence networks left it far behind the Demon Soul Sect in information accuracy and reach.

After the outpost was cleared, the elderly Incense Master approached the Left Envoy obsequiously. “Esteemed Left Envoy, what instructions do you have for us during your unexpected visit?”

“Prepare a fine room for me to rest,” the Left Envoy replied impassively, inwardly grumbling about being dragged here late at night. With the Young Mistress now visiting her beloved, he had nothing better to do than recuperate from the journey—having carried Wang Xiaorong using his spiritual energy, he felt thoroughly drained.

“Of course! Our rooms are all vacant. Please choose any you like,” the old man said.

“Have some dishes and wine brought to me,” the Left Envoy added as he ascended the stairs.

Meanwhile, Wang Xiaorong bombarded Wang Jun with anxious questions about Guan Yu’s safety and troubles.

“Young Mistress, could you please stop asking all at once? We’ll see him shortly—you can ask him directly,” Wang Jun replied with a wry twist of his lips. “Guan Yu’s always meddling in others’ business, and this time’s no exception.”

Upon reaching the inn, Wang Jun led her to Guan Yu’s spacious quarters. Finding the room empty, Wang Xiaorong showed no curiosity about its size.

“Where’s Guan Yu?” Her voice immediately roused the sleeping man.

Having settled Liu Yun and Xiao Yuan in another room, Guan Yu emerged upon hearing the familiar voice. “Xiaorong? You came so quickly?”

Though only ten days had passed, to Wang Xiaorong it felt like half a lifetime. Without a word, she threw herself into his arms.

“Guan Yu, you must have missed me! I knew you would!” she declared happily.

“I did,” Guan Yu chuckled. “And truthfully, I need your help here. The situation’s become rather棘手.”

“Of course! I knew you’d only ask if it were serious. I defied Father’s objections to come with Elder Brother Left Envoy—I couldn’t bear not knowing you were in trouble.”

Noticing the intimate atmosphere, Wang Jun tactfully tried to withdraw. “Guan Yu, where are Liu Yun and Xiao Yuan?”

“They’ve retired for the night. The journey exhausted them—even I was about to sleep when you arrived.”

“Mother and child? There are others here?” Wang Xiaorong’s curiosity sharpened. She scrutinized every detail about Guan Yu’s companions, though only Si Qi ever stirred her jealousy.

Recognizing her醋意, Guan Yu explained, “We met Liu Yun母女 in a town where they sheltered us during trouble. Now they face danger—I couldn’t abandon them.”

“But must you share a room?” Wang Xiaorong gestured pointedly.

Wang Jun edged toward the exit, sensing impending conflict.

“He booked the rooms,” Guan Yu indicated Wang Jun. “I sent him ahead to arrange things. The母女 arrived later by slower carriage.”

Wang Xiaorong glared at Wang Jun. “Have you lost your mind? Don’t you know our relationship? Why would you house him with other women?”

Trembling at her wrath, Wang Jun bowed deeply. “This subordinate erred in judgment. It won’t happen again.”

“Xiaorong, it’s reasonable—we have three separate rooms here. You’re overreacting,” Guan Yu interceded.

“Fine. But if it happens again…” She left the threat hanging before turning to Liu Yun’s door. “I want to see them.”

Despite Guan Yu’s suggestion to wait until morning, she marched forward. Liu Yun emerged, holding a sleeping Xiao Yuan.

“You must be Guan Yu’s friend,” Liu Yun said softly. “Forgive my appearance—we didn’t mean to disturb you.”

Wang Xiaorong’s hostility melted upon seeing the plain-dressed, tired-looking woman. “Not at all. Since you’re Guan Yu’s friend, we’ll help. You should rest.”

Relieved, Guan Yu suggested supper. Wang Jun returned with a lavish spread, clearly aiming to please.

Over the meal, Guan Yu recounted the corrupt magistrate and human trafficking ring. “They’re selling trained women to wealthy buyers. We must stop the next shipment.”

“But without evidence, how?” Wang Xiaorong frowned.

“That’s why I need your influence. If someone authoritative investigates, we can provide clues discreetly.”

“I’ll consult Elder Brother Left Envoy tomorrow. He’ll find a way.” Privately, she wondered if the Demon Soul Sect, often labeled a demonic faction, would intervene. If not, bribing officials remained an option.

As Wang Jun served the feast, Guan Yu noted wryly that his subterfuge as a Cloud Azure Sect spy remained hidden from Wang Xiaorong—for now. The night’s tensions eased into strategic planning, their fates entangled with bureaucratic corruption and sect politics.
