Park Xu glared fiercely at Guan Yu, snorted with displeasure, then pointed at Guan Yu and instructed Old Luo to send someone to the supermarket.

After placating the male lead, Old Luo turned to look at Guan Yu and Niu Le. Grinning wryly, he waved them aside. When they reached a secluded spot, Old Luo sighed, “Stay away from that man. He’s notoriously short-tempered! Don’t argue with him—just keep your distance. His family partly sponsors this production. Even the director speaks politely to him!”

Guan Yu curled his lip disdainfully. *Damn, an actor putting on airs. So what if he’s a star?*

Seeing Guan Yu’s sullen silence, Old Luo shook his head. “Young man, let it go… When you graduate, you’ll enter this industry too. We crew members can’t afford to provoke A-list celebrities. One word from the director, and we lose our jobs!”

As they spoke, several staff members called for Old Luo. He hurriedly reassured the two before rushing off.

Guan Yu spat on the ground and glared at Park Xu, who was drinking water in the distance. The pampered twenty-one-year-old actor tilted his head back, shooting Guan Yu a provocative smirk brimming with hostility. Having been openly contradicted, Park Xu now held a grudge against both Guan Yu and Niu Le.

**Chapter 335: Who Is This Woman?**

Park Xu’s gaze burned with challenge and animosity. Guan Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered coldly.

Noticing the hostility, Niu Le growled, “That son of a bitch asking for a beating? Big Bro, let me thrash him!”

Guan Yu pulled him back. “Ignore that pretty boy. Let’s watch the show. If it’s boring, we’ll leave.” He dragged Niu Le to a nearby chair, where they casually observed the commotion.

Minutes later, several young actresses emerged from a makeshift dressing tent. Giggling coquettishly, they flocked around Park Xu, clearly vying for the attention of the wealthy, handsome lead.

Niu Le snorted discontentedly, muttering under his breath. The sight of so many beauties fawning over the pretty boy clearly irked him.

Guan Yu glanced indifferently at the scene. When his gaze met Park Xu’s, the actor curled his lip in a smug, triumphant grin.

As Park Xu chatted animatedly with the actresses, a beige sports car entered the filming area. Though Guan Yu didn’t recognize the luxury brand, its majestic design exuded opulence.

The moment the yellow car arrived, the entire crew froze. Staff members turned in unison, while the director and producers hurried forward to greet the newcomer. Even Park Xu hastily disentangled himself from the women and rushed to the car.

*Who’s this with such grand airs?* Guan Yu wondered.

The car door opened, revealing delicate brown high heels and slender, stocking-clad legs that shimmered like fish scales in the sunlight. Before Guan Yu could see more, the crowd surged forward, blocking his view. Through the throng, he glimpsed only a flash of black skirt and shapely legs.

*Who the hell is she?* Guan Yu’s curiosity burned as the woman—surrounded by admirers—glided toward the tents. Park Xu trailed behind her, oozing sycophantic charm with his practiced gentlemanly smiles.

*Hypocrite!* Guan Yu thought, recalling how Park Xu had leered at the actresses’ cleavage and thighs earlier. Yet despite his disdain, he couldn’t deny his growing interest. *Why is everyone fawning over this woman?*

“Let’s go,” Niu Le grumbled, rubbing his stomach. “This is boring.”

“Wait a bit longer,” Guan Yu insisted, determined to solve the mystery. *Could it be Gao Wei? But the crew said she wouldn’t arrive until tomorrow…*

As the crowd dispersed after the woman entered a tent, a supervisor barked, “Back to work!” The crew scattered, accustomed to such spectacles.

Filming resumed, but the mysterious woman remained out of sight. Park Xu now portrayed a character with dual personalities—alternating between suave charm and deranged madness. Guan Yu scoffed at the actor’s exaggerated “cool” poses but grudgingly admitted his convincing portrayal of insanity.

When Park Xu’s character violently pinned a screaming actress against a tree, even Niu Le tensed as if ready to intervene. After the director called “Cut!”, Park Xu instantly transformed back into his genteel persona, gently helping the actress up.

“Actors…” Guan Yu muttered derisively at the rapid shifts. “Let’s leave.”

As they turned to go, the director pointed at them. “You two—assist Young Master Park with props during filming.”

Guan Yu glared, ready to refuse, when a young woman emerged from a tent. Dressed in a white sundress that made her resemble a woodland fairy, she looked up while brushing hair from her face—and froze upon seeing Guan Yu.

Their eyes locked. Guan Yu’s jaw dropped.

*Holy shit! It’s her—Gao Wei!*

**Chapter 336: Temporary Assistant**

Gao Wei approached, her surprise melting into a faint smile. Park Xu rushed to intercept her. “You should rest! Your scenes come later.”

Ignoring him, Gao Wei addressed Guan Yu: “These two will be my temporary assistants.” Her intervention diffused the tension, though the director shot Guan Yu a warning look.

As Gao Wei led them away, she asked Guan Yu, “Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be in college?”

“School arranged this,” he shrugged. “Came when I heard you were the lead.”

She warned him about Park Xu’s influential background, but Guan Yu remained unimpressed. When filming resumed, Park Xu ordered Guan Yu to fetch costumes.

Niu Le exploded: “Watch your mouth! Want paint dumped on your pretty face?”

Chaos erupted until Gao Wei reappeared. “Enough! They’re my assistants now.”

Later, while Gao Wei prepared for her scene, Niu Le whispered, “Bro! You know the goddess? Since when?”

“Shut up and watch,” Guan Yu snapped, though his eyes lingered on Gao Wei’s ethereal beauty.

During Gao Wei and Park Xu’s scene, the actor snapped at Guan Yu: “Get out of the shot!”

Before Guan Yu could retort, Gao Wei called him over. “My zipper’s stuck. Help me check it.”

The crew gaped as the notoriously aloof star allowed a mere assistant near her. Guan Yu moved behind her, examining the white dress’s neckline zipper—

**Chapter 337: Aren’t You Chinese?**

[...]

**Chapter 338: Expulsion Order**

“I’m mixed race! Korean!” Park Xu ground out through clenched teeth.

Niu Le sneered, “So you couldn’t make it there and came here to leech?”

Changing tactics, Park Xu asked about Gao Wei’s connection to Guan Yu.

Niu Le puffed his cigarette. “My bro’s a lady-killer. The prettier they are, the harder they fall for him.”

Realizing he’d been mocked, Park Xu seethed. *Damn hick!*
