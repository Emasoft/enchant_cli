What’s even stranger is that every man of the Ha Clan possesses extraordinary strength as if born with it. Even those who don’t focus on training become immensely powerful wrestlers. This peculiarity is compounded by the fact that their physiques grow increasingly robust over time.

The average height of an ordinary Ha Clan man exceeds six feet, a trait that arouses suspicion among outsiders. However, the women remain largely unchanged, showing no signs of unusual strength, though their lifespans have notably lengthened compared to before.

**Chapter 4525: Changes Occur**

Yet these transformations and phenomena bear no relation to the so-called “secret manuals” rumored outside. The clan leader himself possesses no such manuals. As for the cause, he once suspected the ancient well within the Wooden Tower.

Perhaps the well’s water triggered the Ha Clan’s metamorphosis, but this still does not explain the supposed manuals. The clan leader never imagined the mere rumor of these manuals would bring such calamity upon his people.

“I’ve told you—the Ha Clan has no secret manual you seek. Even if you slaughter everyone here, I cannot produce what doesn’t exist. At this point, do you truly believe I’d still lie? Do you think I’d cling to a nonexistent manual while watching children die by your hand?” The clan leader’s voice trembled with desperation.

Xiaomei pondered. Perhaps she had overthought this. The Ha Clan likely held no manuals, and further interrogation would prove futile. If such a manual existed, they would have surrendered it by now. During her stay with the Ha Clan, she had come to know the leader as fiercely protective of his kin—a man who would prioritize their lives over pride.

“If there’s no manual, then explain this: where does your men’s strength come from?” Xiaomei demanded. “Don’t claim it’s mere training. I won’t believe that.”

The old clan leader sighed. “I don’t know who spread the rumor of a manual, but they clearly meant to harm us. As for your question—it’s one I’ve studied for years. I concluded it must stem from our ancient well. Prolonged consumption of its water has altered us.”

Xiaomei found this plausible. During her six months with the Ha Clan, she’d noticed no changes except feeling increasingly youthful. She’d initially attributed this to her dalliances with Mazhagen, but now realized the well’s water was the true cause.

With this revelation, further questions were pointless. The Ha Clan’s fabled “secret manual” was mere hearsay. All her efforts had been wasted. Yet having antagonized the clan, she couldn’t release the hostages now. The Ha Clan must be eradicated to prevent future threats.

**Chapter 4526: What Did You Expect?**

The next morning, Mazhagen prepared his forces, leaving only two guards at the Wooden Tower to protect the elderly and children. The rest marched to attack the Jia Yi Sect.

Guanyu’s group also readied themselves. Mazhagen advised, “Ride camels for speed, but leave unnecessary belongings here to lighten your load.”

“Agreed. Let’s store our gear in a tent,” Guanyu replied. “We’ll travel swifter.”

The camels, well-fed the previous night, brimmed with energy. Mazhagen led the vanguard, followed by Guanyu’s party. Within two hours, they reached the Jia Yi Sect’s territory.

“Sect Leader, the Ha Clan approaches. How shall we respond?” a subordinate reported.

Inside a grand tent, atop a raised platform resembling a throne, Xiaomei reclined on a lavish couch. “Mobilize all forces. This battle decides our fate,” she declared, rising with a sweep of her hand.

Anticipating the attack, Xiaomei had positioned hostages at the center of her formation, encircled by cultivators and guards. This tactic, inspired by the Bru Clan incident, aimed to deter enemy spells—any attack would endanger the hostages.

The Ha Clan’s warriors typically charged ahead to shield their cultivators. Last time, a single protective spell had thwarted their assault. Now, facing greater numbers, Xiaomei deemed the hostage shield essential.

Guanyu frowned at the setup. Mazhagen signaled caution to avoid harming captives. Among the crowd, a masked woman sat regally on a golden palanquin—clearly the sect leader. Though her youth surprised Guanyu, he focused on strategy.

Unable to unleash area spells, Guanyu opted for defensive enchantments on the Ha Clan fighters. Meanwhile, he and Siqi could target Xiaomei directly with precision strikes.

**Chapter 4527: Miscalculation**

The sight of a young woman as sect leader baffled Guanyu. Her exposed skin suggested she was barely past adolescence. Mazhagen, heart heavy, stepped forward.

“Xiaomei, the clan leader saved you, adopted you, treated you kindly. I cherished you. How can you feel no remorse?”

“Remorse? Don’t jest!” Xiaomei sneered.

The hostages now realized Xiaomei’s identity. The clan leader burned with shame for sheltering a viper.

“Fool! My ‘injuries’ were a ruse to infiltrate your clan and search for the manual,” Xiaomei spat. “Your leader pretended fatherly care but lusted after me. He forbade our relationship to keep me for himself. You desired my beauty, not my heart. Admit it!”

The clan leader flushed crimson, recalling his failed advances. Murmurs of disgust rippled through the crowd.

“Enough!” Mazhagen roared. “Release my people, or blood will flow!”

“You think cultivators frighten me?” Xiaomei retorted. “Attack!”

As spells erupted, Guanyu barked orders: “Shield Mazhagen’s group!” Cloud Azure disciples layered protective auras on the Ha Clan warriors.

Xiaomei’s first assault—blades raining from a vortex—met Aze’s defensive barrier, bolstered by his magic brush. When her second strike came, Siqi’s jade scepter summoned an even stronger shield.

Guanyu seized the opening, slashing his Soulfall Blade to scatter enemy lines. Ha Clan fighters surged through the breach, but the Jia Yi Sect’s numbers soon overwhelmed them.

Xiaomei’s smirk faded as her plan crumbled. Guanyu’s keen eyes spotted her preparing another spell. “Siqi, reinforce the shields!”

The swift counter left Xiaomei gaping. Her vortex faltered against Siqi’s preemptive defense. Guanyu’s blade-art shattered enemy ranks, but the tide of battle shifted unpredictably...
