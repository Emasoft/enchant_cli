“Don’t say that! I, Guan Yu, am sincerely grateful to you, old brother. We’ll have many opportunities to work together in the future. Let’s not fuss over such trivial matters. Besides, there’s no guarantee we’ll profit anyway?” Guan Yu waved his hand with a smile.

As the two chatted, Du Xueheng had settled payment for the first batch of six or seven raw stones. This single purchase alone cost over four million yuan. Clearly, these were top-grade materials from the old mining pit—extremely valuable with high chances of lucrative returns.

Yet the jade-gambling trade lived by the adage: “One cut brings poverty, another brings wealth, and yet another shrouds you in hemp cloth.” Countless examples existed of enthusiasts spending entire fortunes on promising-looking raw stones, only to find nothing upon cutting. Risk and fortune walked hand in hand.

“Continue! Continue!” Du Xueheng directed his attendants to carry out his purchased stones while urging Professor Lin to hurry his selections.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu led Niu Le and Li Yunshan in casually browsing through the room’s offerings. Piles of rough jade littered the space as Guan Yu swiftly dug beneath them, selecting three modestly sized stones of about ten kilograms each.

After a cursory inspection, Guan Yu found no exceptional materials. Though many showed traces of green jadeite, their exorbitant prices left little room for profit. “Let’s take these three for now. Old brother, surely they don’t only have these stones here?”

Li Yunshan blinked. “There’s another stockyard behind, but... those materials are inferior.”

Guan Yu nodded with a casual smile. “Let’s look anyway. Who knows—we might find premium jade there? These are too expensive for decent margins.”

Understanding immediately, Li Yunshan led the group to a rear warehouse where jade roughs lay in disorganized heaps. “These stones are cheaper—thousands or even hundreds per piece,” Li Yunshan explained. Normally, he’d ignore such rejects with minuscule chances of containing jade. But witnessing Guan Yu’s prior miracle of extracting legendary glass-grade emerald from scrap in Yunnan, he felt confident.

Kneeling, Guan Yu meticulously examined stones, selecting those with promising green hues and translucency while discarding lackluster specimens. After choosing over a dozen, he frowned. How much could he truly earn this way? Worse—if all his picks yielded jade, suspicions would surely arise!

Chapter 209: How Could This Be?

Tossing aside seven or eight barren stones, Guan Yu sighed. “Enough for now. I’ll browse elsewhere for worthwhile purchases.”

As Li Yunshan instructed his man Tiger to settle payments for selected stones, Guan Yu wandered. The rear stockyard held nothing remarkable—no ice-grade jadeite, let alone superior varieties. His chosen stones might yield four to five million yuan profit at best.

Exiting the warehouse, they encountered Burmese workers hauling a meter-square boulder fresh from mining, its surface still muddy. Guan Yu’s casual glance triggered inner shock—the stone glowed crimson within!

Baffled, he asked Li Yunshan, “Does jadeite come in other colors?”

“Black and red exist. Black is low-grade, though some sell decently. Red jadeite? One in ten thousand. Cheap when ordinary, but top-grade red surpasses ice-grade green by multiples—rare treasures!”

Nodding, Guan Yu eyed the massive stone. “Can we transport this?”

“Easily! The mine owner can escort it to the border.” Without hesitation, Li Yunshan sent Tiger to negotiate. After purchasing the 700,000-yuan boulder, they returned to find Du Xueheng ecstatic over thirty-odd stones—his all-in gamble.

“Li! Look!” Du Xueheng thrust forward a cut stone. “Professor Lin’s device works—this 30,000-yuan stone is worth 500,000!” Guan Yu glanced at the mediocre jadeite within, noting half the selected stones contained worthless green streaks.

As Professor Lin emerged announcing another “find,” Guan Yu’s inspection revealed another dud. He warned Du Xueheng, “These will lose money—especially the large ones.”

Du Xueheng sneered, “Worry about your own deals. I know what I’m doing!” Stung, Guan Yu retreated. Li Yunshan pulled him aside, puzzled by his concern for a stranger.

Chapter 210: You’re My Blood Ancestor

The return trip saw euphoric buyers until stone-cutting began. Du Xueheng’s complexion sickened as slice after slice revealed losses. “How?!” he croaked, collapsing as his 20-million-yuan investment—his entire liquidity—evaporated.

Other lamenting buyers cursed Professor Lin and Du Xueheng. “I said never bet on speckled surfaces! You fools!”

Meanwhile, Li Yunshan’s stones began yielding—green after green. By afternoon’s end, thirty cuts had netted over ten million yuan. When the massive boulder reached the saw, the crowd erupted at the revelation: ice-grade crimson jadeite—a half-meter-square treasure worth billions.

Li Yunshan trembled, grabbing Guan Yu. “Brother—no, ancestor! You’re my blood ancestor! How can I ever repay this? Everything I own is yours!”

Amidst the frenzy, Du Xueheng stared hollowly at Guan Yu—the man who’d tried to save him. Too late.
