His eyes still involuntarily strayed to the small white-socked foot. Coughing awkwardly, he sat down helplessly and reached to pull at the quilt.

“Mmph…this is so embarrassing! I can’t face anyone! Stop tugging—hey! I’ll kick you!” Du Xiaojuan’s muffled threats emerged from beneath the covers as she squirmed.

When Guan Yu persisted in trying to peel the quilt from her head, she lifted her foot and lashed out blindly.

“Wait—don’t!” Caught off guard, Guan Yu found her sole planted squarely against his shoulder. Instinctively, he tilted his head and trapped her ankle against his cheek.

“Uh…” Frozen in disbelief, Guan Yu swallowed hard.

**Chapter 44: The Foot Fetishist**

Du Xiaojuan halted her struggles mid-wriggle, still shrouded in bedding as she blinked dazedly. Peeking out, her face flushed crimson to the roots of her hair. She hastily retracted her left foot, pouting reproachfully at him.

A peculiar psychology gripped her—being casually touched on the hand might not stir such turmoil, but having her foot captured against a man’s cheek sent waves of mortification crashing through her.

“Wh-what are you doing?!” she stammered, wide eyes brimming with accusation.

“I didn’t do anything! You kicked me!”

“Then why’d you take off my shoe?”

Guan Yu grimaced, rolling his eyes. *She’s the one who kicked it off!*

When he stayed silent, Du Xiaojuan curled up and sat upright, studying him intently.

“Are…are you a foot fetishist?” she ventured timidly.

Guan Yu’s face erupted into a shade rivaling ripe tomatoes. “N-no! What nonsense!” he spluttered, teeth gritted. *Where did this brat learn such terms?!*

Her skepticism deepened at his reaction. “It’s okay…I read online that most guys have hidden tendencies. Don’t feel bad!”

*Feel bad?!* Guan Yu nearly choked. He longed to pry open her skull and examine the bizarre wiring within.

“I know you’re shy about admitting it. Here—” To his horror, she kicked off her remaining shoe and draped both socked feet across his knees. Turning sideways, she retrieved her phone as if nothing were amiss. “Read whatever you like. I’ll just…read my book.”

“I—what? I told you I’m not!” His pulse thundered. *Since when did I become a foot fetishist?!*

“Online therapists say acknowledging the issue helps normalize it,” she recited serenely, her melodic voice belying the madness.

Guan Yu teetered on the brink of sanity.

“No kissing or biting!” she suddenly warned, flipping over—just as he stared despairingly at the twin socks adorning his lap. Their eyes met in electric mortification.

Du Xiaojuan’s heart hammered wildly, an alien mix of panic and…anticipation? Returning to her phone, she absorbed nothing. *He claims indifference yet ogled my feet!*

Guan Yu contemplated headbutting the wall. Though part of him thrilled at the delicate arches—their pristine whiteness evoking certain…*educational* foreign films—he refused to accept this absurd label.

“Senior, I’m serious! Stop teasing!” he implored, pushing at her feet. The cotton-soft warmth beneath his palms sent treacherous shivers through him. Gulping, he steeled himself and shoved them aside.

What followed left Du Xiaojuan momentarily stunned before she dissolved into tearful giggles. Emulating her earlier retreat, Guan Yu yanked the quilt over his head.

*I’m being bullied by this innocent-looking imp!* Her peals of laughter finally provoked him to fling off the covers, glowering.

“Keep laughing?” he threatened through clenched teeth.

“Giggle…junior, you’re adorable!”

*Adorable?!* Guan Yu’s soul withered. A six-foot man reduced to “cute”!

As she wiped mirthful tears, he seized her wrists, pinning her down to tickle mercilessly.

“Ahaha! St-stop! I surrender!” She writhed like a caught fish, legs flailing.

When he relented, she gasped breathlessly: “Stinky Guan Yu! Trying to kill me? And you’re totally a foot—”

“I’m NOT!”

“Are too!” She pummeled his chest between giggles until he pinned her limbs, their position growing dangerously intimate. Heart racing, he abruptly silenced her protests with a searing kiss.

**Chapter 45: Willing Participation**

Du Xiaojuan froze. Never had she imagined her first kiss would be stolen so abruptly. Sheltered through high school and wary of suitors daunted by her family’s status, she now lay captive to lips softer than imagined, their tentative exploration sending electric currents through her veins.

Guan Yu marveled at the honeyed warmth, his tentative suckle at her lower lip igniting primal yearning. As their tongues shyly met, time dissolved. His hand crept upward, cupping a soft mound through fabric—

“Mmmph…” Du Xiaojuan broke away dizzily, lips swollen. “Wait…need air.”

Panting, she gazed up through fluttering lashes. “You…you didn’t ask!”

“Then…senior,” he rasped, “may I kiss you?”

“Better.” Smiling coyly, she looped arms around his neck, drawing him down.

Their renewed kiss grew bolder, his thumb circling a peaked nipple through cloth as his thigh pressed between hers.

“Nngh…Guan Yu…” She arched helplessly, the unfamiliar pleasure overwhelming. “I…I want to devour you,” she confessed against his ear, nibbling his jaw.

Encouraged, he nuzzled lower—

“Wait!” She pushed him back, suddenly solemn. “Is this…wrong?”

“Huh?”

“Kissing…touching…shouldn’t that be for couples?” Blushing furiously, she squirmed. “Take your hand away first!”

Chastened, Guan Yu rolled aside. The weight of their rushed intimacy settled heavily.

“Hey…” She poked his arm. “You okay?”

“Yeah.”

“That was my first kiss. Yours too?”

“Yeah.”

Giggling, she propped her head. “How was it…kissing me?”

“G-good,” he managed hoarsely.

“You’re not bad…for a junior.” She sighed dramatically. “Too bad you’re younger. Otherwise…”

“Younger?!” He turned, incredulous.

“My ideal boyfriend needs to dote on me. And I must love him madly!” Her starry-eyed declaration underscored her naivety.

Guan Yu smiled bitterly, recognizing the gulf between fantasy and reality.

**Chapter 46: Shared Secret**

“This…us…” Du Xiaojuan bit her lip. “Should we tell anyone?”

Guan Yu stiffened.

“Kissing’s for couples, right?” Her whisper trembled. “You…do you have a girlfriend?”

“No.”

“Me neither.” She traced idle patterns on the sheets. “But…this stays our secret, okay?”

He nodded mutely, the unspoken question hanging—what were they now?

“Just…don’t avoid me tomorrow.” Her playful facade cracked, revealing vulnerability.

“Never.” Catching her hand, he interlaced their fingers.

They lay in charged silence, the quilt a fragile shield against the world. Outside, dusk painted the sky in hues of possibility—and the terrifying, exhilarating unknown of what came next.
