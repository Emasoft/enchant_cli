“Bang!” A gunshot rang out. Guan Yu cared not for his opponent’s thoughts—his earlier shot had been aimed precisely at their strongest fighter. Seizing the perfect moment, the bullet struck the back of the man’s skull, dropping him lifeless without a struggle.

The gunshot’s crack jolted everyone awake, pulling their stunned gazes away from the aftermath of the meteor spell.

The enemy forces began retreating, their charge halted. Perhaps they had been shaken by Guan Yu’s lethal shot.

“Hold your positions! Do not rush blindly!” someone from the opposing ranks shouted.

The elder from the Cult of the Bloodthirsty Hunt grimaced, the agony in his shoulder unbearable. Satisfied with the meteor spell’s devastation, he slumped to the ground. Though his wound had been staunched with spiritual energy, the pain inexplicably sharpened—a mystery that gnawed at him.

Zou Wuhui, having steeled himself, rushed to the charred carriage and knelt with a dramatic thud. “My prince!” he wailed. “This subordinate has failed to protect you! Forgive me, Your Highness…”

Wang Xiaorong stifled a laugh at Zou Wuhui’s exaggerated performance. Others followed suit, kneeling behind him with bowed heads, feigning grief.

The scene baffled both the enemy and Guan Yu. *What’s happening? Did the prince return to the carriage?*

As Guan Yu puzzled, a cry rose from the enemy: “The target is dead! Retreat!”

“Heh. You claimed we lacked the means to kill Prince Zou,” sneered the elder who had earlier confronted Guan Yu. “What say you now?”

Guan Yu turned coldly. “You’ve won this round. But mark my words: henceforth, neither the jianghu nor the imperial court will harbor your wretched cult. Consider your fate.”

“Wait!” the elder barked. “Our identities are exposed. We cannot leave witnesses—especially not the Elite Guard. If we spare them, not only will our cult suffer, but so will you!”

“The target is eliminated. Further losses here are pointless. Retreat!” another voice countered.

“Fools! We have the advantage! My disciples can unleash another spell. Slaughter them all!”

“Do it yourself, then,” came a icy retort. “My men will no longer be your cannon fodder. Withdraw!”

As Guan Yu had surmised, the attackers were not unified. The vanguard, bearing heavy losses, refused to fight on, while the cult, desperate to erase evidence of their involvement, clashed over strategy.

With the reluctant cultists forced to retreat, the battlefield fell silent. The enemy vanished swiftly, taking even their wounded and dead, leaving no trace.

Guan Yu exhaled. Prince Zou had narrowly escaped death. The ambush had been meticulously planned, exploiting their vulnerabilities. Without the carriage’s destruction as a diversion, another spell might have doomed them all.

The cultivators’ coordinated power stunned him. Though individually weak, their combined might was fearsome—a lesson in why even mighty sects avoided provoking such groups. Shielded by frontline fighters, their spells could turn the tide.

Returning to the group, Guan Yu forced a smile. “False alarm. They believe the prince perished in the flames, and their elder’s injury hastened their retreat.”

Wang Xiaorong grinned. “My idea, wasn’t it brilliant? When they targeted the carriage, I knew they’d assume the prince was inside. Now they’ll never find him.”

“Clever indeed,” Guan Yu acknowledged. The group’s relief contrasted with Hongren’s grief. Many of his comrades lay dead.

“Do not mourn,” Guan Yu said, clasping Hongren’s shoulder. “Loss is inevitable beyond the safety of Redpeak Mountain. This is the price of the jianghu.”

Hongren nodded grimly. “I understand. Leave me be—I’ll endure this.”

Yu Shu approached. The Elite Guard had suffered heavy casualties, particularly from the frenzied, burning horses.

“Your Highness,” a soldier reported, “the wounded require an escort. Severely injured cannot travel—some must remain here until we send carriages from the capital.”

Prince Zou nodded. “My gratitude to the Elite Guard. I owe you a debt.”

“Duty compels us,” Yu Shu replied. Glancing at Guan Yu, he added, “Even I feared you were in the carriage. Your foresight saved you.”

Guan Yu demurred, “Merely luck. We underestimated the enemy. The Second Prince’s alliance with the jianghu blindsided us.”

“Yet we endure,” Zou Wuhui interjected. “Do we press on or rest?”

All turned to the prince, who deferred to Guan Yu.

“We proceed,” Guan Yu declared. “Without a carriage, the prince must ride horseback. Blending into the ranks will safeguard him further.”

The prince agreed. Safety outweighed comfort—even a grueling ride was preferable to death.

As the regrouped convoy set out, Hongren approached the prince. “Your Highness, I beg leave to bury my fallen brothers. It’s the last honor I can offer.”

Guan Yu intervened. “Wait. Alone, you cannot manage. Journey to the capital first. Tomorrow, return with tools and men. The Elite Guard will guard the bodies until then.”

Reluctantly, Hongren acquiesced.

Dawn approached. By midday, they would reach the capital. Exhaustion weighed on the travelers, their weariness palpable as daylight broke.

“Halt and rest,” the prince ordered. “Eat, drink, and regain strength.”

Guan Yu hid a smile. The prince, unaccustomed to horseback, clearly ached. A respite would serve all.

**Chapter 4285: Confirmed**

Meanwhile, the Second Prince awoke irritated, disentangling himself from his twenty-fourth concubine. His Chief Steward, Lao Qian—a covert elder of the Cult of the Bloodthirsty Hunt—awaited urgently.

“Prince Zou is dead,” Lao Qian announced. “Burned alive in his carriage. The Cult’s meteor spell ensured it.”

The Second Prince’s fury melted into glee. “Truly? At last!”

“Witnesses saw his men mourn by the ashes. The Elite Guard’s presence prevented retrieving the body, but his death is certain.”

Ecstatic, the Second Prince rushed to court, eager to claim his uncontested path to the throne.

In the opulent carriage, attendants scrubbed and dressed him as he reveled in triumph. At court, the Emperor, pallid and weary, addressed ministers about northern floods.

The Second Prince stayed uncharacteristically silent, savoring his invisible victory. Prince Zou’s demise marked the end of all opposition—even the feeble Crown Prince posed no threat. The throne, he believed, was now his.
