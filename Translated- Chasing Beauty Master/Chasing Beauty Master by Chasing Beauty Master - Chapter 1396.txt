“To prevent Guan Yu from harboring further suspicions, Master Jiu explained, ‘In truth, I forbid others from entering my study to honor a vow I made long ago. After she decided to leave me, I realized that books were not the only important things in this world. There are many matters and people who hold great significance, all of whom treated me with kindness. She left precisely because I spent every waking moment buried in books, oblivious to her needs and never showing her care.’



Chapter 3620: A Visitor Arrives



‘At the time, I hadn’t understood the meaning of loss. But after her departure, I knew—and I deeply regretted not spending more time with her. In my anguish, I nearly burned my study to ashes, for my love of those books had cost me everything. Later, I swore never to read again. All my collected works would remain sealed forever. It is because of this vow that I cannot allow you entry. If you were to step inside, my promise would be broken. Do you understand?’



After hearing Master Jiu’s explanation, Guan Yu nodded. So this was the reason. It seemed unlikely to find an opening through Master Jiu himself; another approach would be necessary. Though Master Jiu appeared amiable, he was stubborn. Once his mind was set, further persuasion would be futile.



‘I will expedite the matter concerning Miss Yezi, Master Jiu. If there’s nothing else, I’d like to rest. I didn’t sleep well last night,’ Guan Yu said, rising and heading toward his room. As he passed the study, he glanced at the bronze lock on the door.



The lock was enchanted, impossible to open. Frustrated, Guan Yu saw no better option than to abandon the attempt for now. He would wait until Little Dong next cleaned the study.



Returning to his room, Guan Yu calculated the days he had spent at the rear mountain. It was nearly time for Second-to-Wolf to return.



He wondered how his family fared—they must be worried, especially his two elder sisters from Huayu Group. Though strict, forbidding him from this and that, he knew their intentions were good.



Xue Jing, that girl, must miss him terribly after so long. As for Lü Mei and Zhang Han, those two were likely too engrossed in games to spare him a thought. Yingzi had been diligently learning cooking from Xue Jing when he left, and A-Mei… she’d probably cried herself sick by now.



As Guan Yu lost himself in these musings, a knock sounded. Opening the door, he found Little Dong.



‘Back so soon, Little Dong? What treasures did you procure?’ Guan Yu asked with a smile.



‘Someone’s come for me? Ah, it must be Master’s summons. My days here are over—I must leave.’ Watching Little Dong’s gestures, Guan Yu continued, ‘A disciple from Tiger’s Head Peak seeks me? No doubt Master Xuan Ming wishes me to search for Miao City in the desert. Though I anticipated this, I hadn’t expected it so soon.’



He had planned to investigate Master Jiu’s study tonight, but Xuan Ming’s timing left no opportunity. It would have to wait for another visit.



‘Understood. I’ll go shortly,’ Guan Yu signed to Little Dong.



At the front hall of the rear mountain, a disciple waited outside. Guan Yu recognized him as an unremarkable junior from Tiger’s Head Peak.



Without Master Jiu’s permission, the disciple dared not enter. Guan Yu approached and asked, ‘Senior Brother, has Master sent you?’



The disciple nodded. ‘Junior Brother Guan Yu, the Sect Master requests your presence at Tiger’s Head Peak’s main hall for council.’



‘I’ll take my leave of Master Jiu and follow shortly,’ Guan Yu replied. The disciple departed, casting a resentful glance at Little Dong.



‘A deaf-mute gatekeeper,’ the disciple grumbled inwardly. ‘How does Master Jiu endure such company? Knocking for hours under the scorching sun—my legs are numb!’



Returning to the hall, Guan Yu bowed to Master Jiu. ‘Master summons me—likely regarding the desert mission. I take my leave. Please take care.’



Master Jiu smiled. ‘Go. Do not forget my matter.’



‘Rest assured,’ Guan Yu vowed. ‘Once my friend returns, I’ll have him assist with Miss Yezi’s affairs. You’ll be informed immediately of any news.’



After exchanging farewells, Guan Yu hurried to Tiger’s Head Peak’s grand hall. All sect leaders were present, including the recovering Zuo Kong Peak’s Master Xiang.



Greeting Xuan Ming and the elders, Guan Yu stood respectfully. Master Lu rose first. ‘Guan Yu, you know why we’ve summoned you?’



‘I’ve heard nothing,’ Guan Yu feigned ignorance. ‘I’ve been secluded at the rear mountain.’



Master Lu continued, ‘The Demon Sect’s Eight-Sided Drum Technique is said to reside in Miao City, deep in the desert. As our most capable junior disciple, you’re tasked to reach it before the Demon Sect. Can you succeed?’



‘No confidence,’ Guan Yu replied bluntly, stunning the assembly. ‘I lack desert experience. The Demon Sect holds the advantage. How could I be certain?’



Master Lu pressed, ‘You’re our rising star! If you doubt yourself, who else can we rely on?’



Guan Yu countered, ‘Master Xiang once boasted Zuo Kong Peak’s readiness. Let his disciples undertake this.’



Master Xiang, though pale, remained calm. ‘Our disciples are… inadequate. This task requires your skill.’



Smirking, Guan Yu declared, ‘If even Zuo Kong Peak admits incompetence, I’ll accept. What Zuo Kong cannot achieve, I shall!’



Master Lu beamed. ‘Well said! Name your requirements.’



‘I need nothing,’ Guan Yu said loftily. ‘A righteous disciple acts for the sect’s honor, not rewards.’



Murmurs of admiration arose. Master Xiang hid a sneer—let the arrogant fool perish in the desert.



Xuan Ming offered, ‘Will you require companions? Choose any junior disciple.’



Before Guan Yu could answer, Master Xiang interjected, ‘Why burden him? With his prowess, others would only hinder him.’



‘How thoughtful,’ Guan Yu mocked. ‘You’d prefer I die alone? Perhaps I’ll take companions to collect my corpse—so you may celebrate.’



Chastened, Master Xiang fell silent. Guan Yu turned to Xuan Ming. ‘If I may request—assign me Yan Zhao. His skills may prove useful.’



Xuan Ming agreed. ‘So be it. Prepare today. Depart at dawn.’”
