“As for the level of ceremony, that depends on one's status or position in the chieftain's esteem. The highest honor is a roasted whole ox, followed by a suckling pig, then a whole lamb. Today, Ma Zhagen using such high ceremony to receive a new friend—Ha Dabai wasn't sure if this was appropriate.

However, excessive courtesy is naturally preferable. Everyone desires grander rituals, though Ha Dabai recalled the last time the chieftain entertained a friend, only a stewed chicken was served—nothing so lavish.

In the desert, the Ha Clan had methods to raise poultry and livestock for sustenance. Yet this remained a desert—raising animals was troublesome, with feed being the primary issue.

Thus, unless hosting noble guests, such fine dishes weren't served. The chieftain often said: 'Raising these creatures isn't easy. We shouldn't reserve them all for guests—we should enjoy them ourselves since we labored to rear them.'

Ha Dabai wholeheartedly agreed. Whenever he ventured to the Central Plains, he'd return with slaughtered poultry bought externally to share with the clan.

As for why Ma Zhagen treated Ling Su so courteously today with such high honors—it wasn't foolishness nor genuine friendship. The primary reason was Ling Su's silver.

Over a hundred taels of silver constituted immense wealth for the entire Ha Clan, let alone Ma Zhagen personally. He'd scarcely seen such sums in his life.

Thus Ma Zhagen was overjoyed. It was precisely this silver that made him regard Ling Su as a dear friend. Otherwise, given Ling Su's earlier attempt to bully Xiao Mei, Ma Zhagen would have thrown him out immediately.

After enduring discrimination from Jianghu folk, the Ha Clan grew unwelcoming to outsiders. Normally, no outsiders entered their desert domain.

Only the chieftain's external friends received occasional hospitality. Others were neither received nor welcomed.

Ling Su's luck held—firstly, the chieftain was absent. Secondly, he carried over a hundred taels that caught Ma Zhagen's eye, permitting him to stay.

Had the chieftain been present, even with Ling Su's silver, hospitality would've been denied. Though a hundred taels wasn't trivial, the chieftain wouldn't break clan rules for it.

With the chieftain away, Ling Su's fortune held. His displayed silver won Ma Zhagen's favor, earning him this grand reception.

The three sat around the roasting lamb, flames newly lit beneath. Edible portions would take time.

Ma Zhagen filled enormous bowls with wine. Ling Su grimaced—the vessel seemed larger than his head. 'Might as well drink straight from the jug,' he thought.

Ma Zhagen raised his bowl: “Come, Brother Ling Su! Meeting you brings me joy. Let's drain these first!”

Ling Su forced a smile: “Brother Ma Zhagen, I've little tolerance for drink—normally abstain. But meeting you both gladdens me. How about you two drink more while I sip? I beg your understanding.”

This dampened the mood. In Ha Clan culture, refusing drink during festivities was deeply disappointing. Ha Dabai's smile vanished, though as Ma Zhagen's guest, he remained silent.

Ma Zhagen hesitated, smile fading: “If Brother Ling Su abstains, let him converse with us. That too brings joy.”

Noting their displeasure, Ling Su hastily explained: “I don't refuse drink lightly. If I lose sobriety, pursuing enemies may catch me. Even at risk of offending you, I must preserve my life.”

Truthfully, Ling Su's capacity was poor. While Lin Chen could outdrink Tigerhead Peak's best, Ling Su paled in comparison. The enormous bowl alone terrified him—such quantity could kill.

“Brother, such words insult us!” Ma Zhagen declared. “Within Ha Clan territory, any enemy of yours becomes ours. You're under my protection here.”

This assurance relieved Ling Su. With Ha Clan guarding against outsiders like Guanyu's group, limited drinking seemed safe if he maintained awareness.

Ha Dabai added: “Exactly! Outsiders can't enter here. We'd never admit your enemies. Moreover, Ma Zhagen honors you with third-tier roasted lamb. Surely you won't spurn such courtesy?”

Chapter 4497: An Honor

Ling Su nodded: “Very well. Your assurances earn my trust. My earlier caution shames me. I'll punish myself with a sip in apology.”

Lifting the bowl, he noticed milky whiteness—likely fermented mare's milk or goat's milk wine, explaining its hue.

A tentative sip revealed mild alcohol without burn, carrying distinct mutton aroma. Realizing it was low-proof milk wine, Ling Su relaxed—this was barely stronger than water.

“Brother clearly values loyalty! Your trust honors us. We'll drink first to show respect!” Ma Zhagen and Ha Dabai drained their bowls in gulps.

Though knowing the wine's weakness, Ling Su marveled at their capacity. The mutton aftertaste displeased him, but he resolved to treat it as water.

“Your drinking prowess astounds me! Though I can't match it, I'll drink until I retch if needed!”

“Splendid! I knew Ma Zhagen's friends were sterling!” Ha Dabai laughed. “This promises merry drinking!”

They feasted raucously. After five-six bowls, the Ha clansmen remained steady while Ling Su struggled through two, belly distended and mouth reeking of mutton.

Ling Su inquired: “Brother Ma Zhagen, might I attend the Clan Strongman Contest? I'd cherish witnessing such spectacle.”

“Of course! As my friend, you're welcome!” Ma Zhagen answered, though he glanced at Ha Dabai—privately conceding this year's title would go to his rival.

Personally, Ma Zhagen cared more about his relationship with Xiao Mei than the contest, surprised he'd sustained such lasting affection.

Ha Dabai explained: “The contest coincides with our annual wrestling championship—our men's most exhausting yet joyous day. You arrive fortuitously!”

“Honored indeed!” Ling Su pressed: “Who seems favored for this year's title? Surely both of you lead the field?”

Ma Zhagen sighed: “I lack confidence. Last year I barely edged Ha Dabai. After his year's training, he'll surely surpass me. The title is his.”

“You mock me!” Ha Dabai demurred as they exchanged courtesies.

Ling Su changed tack: “If the clan dislikes outsiders, will the chieftain expel me upon return?”

“Never!” Ma Zhagen vowed. “My friends receive the chieftain's tolerance.” Privately, he planned to gift part of the silver to ensure acceptance.

More wine flowed. Ling Su evaded Ma Zhagen's questions with fabricated tales of victimhood.

Raising his bowl again, Ling Su proclaimed: “Meeting you both in this desert is my life's fortune! I toast your generosity!”

The cloying milk wine posed no intoxication threat. They drained another round cheerfully.

By now, several jugs emptied. All showed tipsiness—the deceptively mild drink carried delayed potency.

“Only your Ha Clan could thrive in this harsh desert,” Ling Su remarked.

“Wrong!” Ma Zhagen corrected. “Many groups survive here—like the vicious Jia Yi Sect that pillages desert dwellers.”

Chapter 4498: A Tense State

Ling Su feigned surprise: “How does your small clan withstand such marauders?”

Ha Dabai laughed: “Never underestimate Ha men! The Jia Yi Sect fears us. When they once came seeking supposed cultivation secrets, we bloodied them! They've stayed away for years.”

“Amazing! To know such heroes honors me! Another toast!” Ling Su urged.

Ma Zhagen added: “We regularly curb the Jia Yi Sect's excesses. After the chieftain returns, I'll lead men against their recent expansions.”

Ha Dabai shrugged: “Routine matter. We don't fret over those curs.”

Ling Su's curiosity piqued about rumored cultivation methods. Observing Ma Zhagen single-handedly rotating the heavy lamb on its spit—a feat requiring tremendous strength—he suspected secret techniques.

The desert, he realized, mirrored the Jianghu—heroes and villains coexisting everywhere. If anything, the Jia Yi Sect sounded worse than the Demonic Sect.

As they drank, Ma Zhagen lamented: “This year's title escapes me. The honor shall be yours, Ha Dabai.”

Though putting on brave face, Ma Zhagen smarted—as the chieftain's son, he should uphold family prestige. Ha Dabai remained silent, the lifelong dream within grasp.

Ling Su inquired: “They say past champions could lift oxen single-handed. Do such men still exist?”

“Long gone,” Ma Zhagen sighed. “In our prosperous days, yes. Not since our decline.”

Changing subjects as drunkenness loomed, Ling Su asked: “What other groups inhabit the desert?”

“The worst are Jia Yi Sect—burning, killing, plundering without remorse.”

“But how does your small clan resist?”

Ha Dabai grinned: “Our men fight like ten each! After we repelled their raid for supposed cultivation manuals, they've feared us for years.”

Ling Su's interest in these rumored manuals grew. If existent, he coveted them. Such strength explained Ha warriors' might—like Ma Zhagen effortlessly wielding the heavy roasting spit.

The desert, Ling Su mused, hid unexpected societies. Wherever humans dwelled, good and evil flourished. Here, the Jia Yi Sect's depravity perhaps exceeded the Jianghu's Demonic Soul Sect.

“Another toast!” Ling Su proposed. “To desert's fiercest heroes!”

As they drank, Ling Su noted the milk wine's delayed effect—his head now swam despite low alcohol content. The Ha men, consuming multiples of his intake, likewise slurred.

Ma Zhagen suddenly lamented: “This year's contest... the honor leaves our family. Bitter indeed.”

Though resigned, his tone betrayed pain—the chieftain's son should uphold tradition. Ha Dabai stayed quiet, desire and ambition warring with comradeship.

Ling Su recognized the strained dynamic. His plans crystallized—exploit this rivalry, uncover cultivation secrets, and turn desert powers against his pursuers. For now, he played the grateful guest, toasting with foul-tasting wine that promised future advantage.
