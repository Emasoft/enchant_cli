After Guan Yu emerged from the tent, the group was still packing their belongings. Startled by his sudden appearance, Aze was the first to react, shouting, "Who are you? When did you arrive here?"

"Stay calm, everyone. I'm Guan Yu." He raised his hands in reassurance. Siqi then stepped out behind him, standing by his side. Had Siqi not been present, no one would have believed this transformed figure was truly Guan Yu—the change was utterly inconceivable.

Wang Jun approached and asked, "Why are you disguising yourself again? Are we assuming false identities once more?"

"Exactly. Gather around, everyone," Guan Yu called out. When the group assembled, he continued, "From now on, you must forget our status as disciples of the Yunqing Sect. For our safety, we'll adopt new identities. Since we're all wearing the robes of Jiayi Sect disciples, we'll pose as their members. No one must reveal our true affiliation. This is crucial for everyone's protection."

Aze nodded. "So from this moment, we're Jiayi Sect followers. I agree—this is wise. Given the Yunqing Sect's prominence, many would seek to target us. Concealing our identities offers greater security."

Wang Jun added, "Should I also alter my appearance? It would be troublesome if someone recognizes me."

"If you don't mind the inconvenience, I won't stop you," Guan Yu replied calmly. "Frankly, applying thick makeup, attaching fake beards, and wearing wigs in this sweltering heat is exhausting. But it's necessary for our safety."

He continued, "Furthermore, no one should address me as Guan Yu anymore. Call me 'Old Guan' instead. Since we're changing identities, our names must change too."

Curious, Aze circled Guan Yu, chuckling. "Old Guan? That's rather amusing. But tell me—did you saw off part of your leg for this disguise?"

"It looks fascinating! Can you help me try a disguise too?" one senior brother joked, clearly entertained by Guan Yu's new appearance.

"I'm not exaggerating—this is truly uncomfortable." Guan Yu pointed to the sweat beading on his forehead. "Not everyone needs disguises, but I'm a special case. During previous missions, I've been recognized by many in the jianghu—disciples from the Soul Demon Sect and Crimson Lotus Sect know me by sight. If they spot me, our ruse would collapse. Hence this transformation."

The group accepted his explanation without question. When Xiaomei was summoned, the naturally curious girl stared at Guan Yu in disbelief. His shortened stature, aged wrinkles, beard, and altered voice made him unrecognizable—she wouldn't have believed this was Guan Yu even if threatened.

"I don't care! You must teach me this disguise technique!" Xiaomei demanded stubbornly, pouting. "If you refuse, I'll expose your Yunqing Sect identities and ruin your charade!"

Guan Yu sighed helplessly. With the northern group approaching rapidly, he finally persuaded Xiaomei to wait until after their departure for lessons.

The approaching party halted fifty meters away, their leader shouting, "Who are you blocking our path?"

Guan Yu and Xiaomei stood at the forefront, observing the forty-strong group clad in unfamiliar attire. "Do you recognize them?" Guan Yu whispered.

"Not exactly," Xiaomei murmured. "Their robes resemble those of the Blade Arrival Gang, but I'm uncertain."

Guan Yu scoffed loudly, "You jest! Accusing us of blocking your path? In this endless desert where anyone may traverse freely? We arrived first—your accusation is laughable!"

The desert indeed had no defined paths, only endless dunes. The accusation was clearly pretextual—either targeting their smaller group or seeking trouble outright.

As the opposing group conferred among themselves, someone declared, "This is our planned route through the flattest terrain!"

Another voice, more diplomatic, added, "We've no time for conflict. Please step aside."

Guan Yu considered yielding to avoid confrontation, but Xiaomei—accustomed to the Jiayi Sect's dominant desert reputation—refused. "What pack of wild dogs dares bark here? State your names!" she shouted defiantly.

The opposing group's leader, a middle-aged man dismounting his camel, addressed Guan Yu calmly, "Elder, is this your granddaughter? The desert is no playground. Take her home."

"Big Brother A," a voice protested from their ranks, "will you let that insult pass?"

The leader ignored this, telling Xiaomei, "Apologize, and we'll let this go."

"Apologize? In your dreams!" Xiaomei retorted. "I've roamed these sands six hundred years—never bowed to anyone! You think numbers frighten me? Try laying hands on us!"

When challenged to reveal their sect, Xiaomei declared, "I am the Jiayi Sect's Matriarch! Your ancestors weren't born when I ruled these sands!"

The group grew uneasy at her bold claims. Guan Yu interjected, "Your robes suggest Blade Arrival Gang ties. What's your connection?"

"These were gifts from them," their leader admitted. "We're the Highland Sect, allied with both Blade Arrival Gang and Yunqing Sect. Cross us at your peril!"

This provoked uproarious laughter from Guan Yu's companions. The notion of threatening Yunqing Sect disciples with their own sect's name was prepirous.

Suspecting demonic sect affiliation, the Highland Sect drew weapons. Their leader brandished a dagger-sized spiritual tool, while disciples wielded ordinary blades—pathetic compared to Yunqing's arsenal.

Wang Jun stepped forward, casually aiming his crossbow. "Planning to attack with those toys?"

"Stay your hand," Guan Yu warned quietly, then addressed the group: "Blind fools! You threaten whom you claim as allies!"
