“A great hero?” The man sneered darkly. “What a joke. What use is a ‘great hero’? Can heroism fill your belly? The weak are meat for the strong. To survive in this world, heroes are worthless—they die young. We brothers have no taste for such foolishness.”

**Chapter 5053: Shifting Circumstances**

In a dilapidated inn within a small town, Guan Yu and his companions faced dire straits. Jiang Yuan-kai and Qiqi had fallen victim to poison—a notorious concoction of the Eleven Prairie Brothers, long infamous in the martial world. Now, Guan Yu alone sparred with their schemes.

He had unraveled the mystery of the poisoning. Thankfully, he had abstained from drinking the wine—a decision owed to Duan Ruxue’s earlier admonition about “warming liquor to nourish the kidneys.” Without her advice, he might have imbibed long ago.

Yet one puzzle gnawed at him. Hearing the brothers boast of their venom’s potency, Guan Yu questioned, “But your poison seems unreliable. They drank the tea and show clear symptoms, yet *she*”—he gestured to Xiao Rong—“drank it too and remains unharmed. Why?”

Before the brothers could retort, Jiang Yuan-kai rasped an explanation: “Young Master Wan, this poison’s sole purpose is to briefly disperse one’s internal energy. Martial artists thus weakened become helpless prey. But Miss Xiao Rong… perhaps she isn’t a practitioner. For ordinary folk—those without internal energy—the poison is harmless.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit with understanding. One of the Eleven Brothers chuckled, “Heh, the Imperial Son-in-law’s knowledge is as vast as his reputation. Truly, your experience shines.”

“So Ruxue would also be unaffected, like Xiao Rong?” Guan Yu mused. He poured tea for Duan Ruxue, offering it with a smile. “You must be thirsty. Drink to calm your nerves.”

“Poisoned tea? How vile!” She recoiled, pointing accusingly. “You’re insufferable!”

“Merely testing the poison’s effect,” he replied innocently. “It won’t kill you.”

“Fiend! Drink it yourself!” she snapped, cheeks flushed.

Jiang Yuan-kai watched wearily. That Guan Yu could jest amid peril spoke either of utter disregard for the Eleven Brothers or dangerous overconfidence.

Guan Yu turned to the disguised innkeeper. “Among your eleven, you seem the eldest. Are you their leader?”

The man nodded brusquely. “I am. What of it?”

“First—where are our people? Have you captured them?”

“Foolish question!” The fake innkeeper waved a hand. “Bring them in!” Soon, Xiao Wu and others were dragged forth—bound, pale, eyelids drooping with poison’s weight, mirroring Jiang Yuan-kai’s state.

“Imperial Son-in-law,” the leader sneered, “let’s speak plainly. These captives mean nothing. Return them I shall. You know our aim: the East Sea Dragon Pearl. Hand it over, and we depart. Harm none. Agreed?”

Jiang Yuan-kai rasped weakly, “You… plotted well. Scared the townsfolk into darkness, seized this inn knowing I’d come. Once, I respected you Eleven Brothers as heroes. Had you faced me honorably, I’d have surrendered the Pearl without quarrel. But this… this venomous trickery? Even in death, you’ll never claim it!”

“Heroics now, when you’re crippled?” The leader spat. “Against a top-ten martial master like you? Without schemes, we’d never dare! Enough blather! Spare your breath—we’d have killed you already if not for lingering respect.”

“Imbeciles!” Guan Yu cut in. “You think anyone carries a treasure like the Dragon Pearl openly? Would *you*? It’s surely hidden elsewhere!”

His words, meant to stall, only inflamed them. “Enough nonsense!” the leader roared. “Jiang Yuan-kai! Must we torture you into compliance?”

Guan Yu stepped forward. “Your plan failed—I never drank the wine. You’d have struck earlier otherwise.”

“Think we fear you?!” The leader surged, but Guan Yu’s hand flashed blue—a silver needle gleaming with cold light. “Your poison affects martial artists’ energy… but against cultivators?” He smiled mirthlessly. “Useless.”

**Chapter 5054: Complications Unveiled**

Guan Yu’s display sent the brothers into hushed panic. Wang Xiao Rong then produced her Butterfly Pouch artifact, tendrils of spiritual energy swirling. “These ruffians? I’ll handle them.”

The Eleven Brothers paled. Their sword formations could trap martial experts, but against cultivators? In close quarters, spells would overwhelm them before blades could dance.

Jiang Yuan-kai stared at the pouch, aghast. “The Butterfly Pouch… You’re the Demon Cult’s Young Master!”

Wang Xiao Rong winced at Guan Yu—her identity, exposed. Even Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated Jiang recognizing the artifact.

“Sharp eyes,” Guan Yu acknowledged. “After the Demon Matriarch’s death, the pouch passed to her sole heir. But circumstances… are complicated. We’ll explain later.”

The Eleven Brothers recoiled. “Imperial Son-in-law consorting with the Demon Cult?!” their leader jeered. “When this spreads, your honor will crumble!”

Jiang Yuan-kai’s face tightened—reputation was his lifeblood. Guan Yu saw the danger. Rising, his aura erupted, pressing down like a mountain. “None here will live to speak of it.”

His energy—realm of a Peak Boundary Sovereign—crushed the room. One brother bolted for the door. Wind hissed—Guan Yu vanished, reappearing to kick the fugitive back. The man screamed, a bloodied needle piercing his foot.

“I cultivate both magic and martial arts,” Guan Yu intoned. “Many covet the Dragon Pearl… but you? Too bold. Too vile. Do you merit mercy?”

The brothers’ resolve shattered. Quarrels erupted: “I said this was suicide!” “Now we face a demonic dual-cultivator!”

Guan Yu’s gaze frosted. “Final words? Or shall I end this?”

Pleading erupted. “Spare us! We saw nothing!” Knees thudded as men kowtowed. Their leader cursed their cowardice, but fear reigned.

Jiang Yuan-kai watched grimly. Mass slaughter troubled him, yet Guan Yu’s logic held—dead men tell no tales. Wang Xiao Rong sighed, stowing her pouch. “Had I known you’d resolve this, I’d have stayed hidden.”

Duan Ruxue’s admiration for Guan Yu chilled to dread. His aura—once heroic—now reeked of bloodshed. Yet what choice remained?

**Chapter 5055: Pleas for Mercy**

The poisoned man wailed, clutching his foot. Guan Yu stood implacable. “Begging won’t sway me. You chose this path.”

“But… but we’ll vanish!” one brother wept. “Never speak of the Cult! Please!”

Their leader roared, “Die with dignity!” but dissenters turned on him. “*You* led us here!” “Meet your fate alone!”

Guan Yu observed coldly. Their unity—the Eleven Brothers’ famed strength—crumbled like dust. Justice demanded their end, yet the weight of eleven lives gave pause.

Jiang Yuan-kai finally spoke, voice strained. “Guan Yu… Must bloodshed be the only way?”

The room held its breath. Even heroes, it seemed, could falter before the abyss.
