Zhang Han pouted her little mouth in displeasure, springing out of Guan Yu's arms in a flash. Swinging the snack-filled bag in her hand, she charged into the crowd with flying fists and kicking feet.

Guan Yu stopped to watch with amusement. This little ancestor Zhang Han was vicious – she specifically aimed her kicks at the crotches. Every victim unleashed heaven-shaking wails, some even collapsing unconscious from the pain before they could scream.

The white Mary Jane shoes on Zhang Han's tiny feet looked adorable with their round toe caps bearing panda patterns. But their cuteness proved inversely proportional to the agony they inflicted when smashing into sensitive areas.

Guan Yu felt his scalp tighten as he watched, phantom numbness creeping through his own groin. This little imp could truly kill a man.

Within moments, over a dozen men lay moaning on the ground. The remaining attackers stood frozen, hands instinctively shielding their vulnerable parts.

"You think this old lady is some sickly kitten? Try coming closer and I'll kick you to death!" Zhang Han jabbed her finger at the cowering circle.

Her triumphant sneer melted into dismay when she peered into her snack bag. "You rotten bastards crushed all my treats!" she wailed, face flushing crimson. "I'll murder every last one of you!"

With a flying leap, she planted her foot square in the face of the nearest thug. The man's nose crumpled as he flew backward, slamming into a tree five meters away with a sickening crunch.

Guan Yu moved swiftly, grabbing Zhang Han before she could strike again. "Enough! You'll kill someone for real!"

The struggling girl twisted like an eel in his grip, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks. "Waaah! It's all their fault! They ruined my snacks! Uncle-in-law, make them pay! Kill them all!"

Guan Yu sighed. These snacks meant more to her than life itself – though he noted wryly that she'd been the one using them as a weapon. When this princess threw a tantrum, the entire city trembled. The sight of her precious treats reduced to crumbs would indeed spark nuclear-level meltdowns.

"Alright, alright," he soothed. "We'll make these idiots pay tenfold. They'll buy you mountains of new snacks, okay?"

"I don't want their stinky money!" she hiccuped, burying her face in his chest. "Waaah! I hate them! Hate them!"

Guan Yu rocked the sniffling girl. "Then I'll buy you new ones myself. A whole truckload. Just name the store."

The tears slowed. Red-rimmed eyes peered up at him. "Really? You'll take me shopping?"

"Cross my heart. We'll fill carts until they overflow."

After considerable coaxing, Guan Yu carried his sniffling charge toward campus gates. The remaining thugs scattered like cockroaches before his murderous glare, their leader Chen Maosheng fleeing into the woods.

The supermarket's fluorescent lights gleamed on overflowing carts. Guan Yu watched in dismay as Zhang Han meticulously inspected each package.

"Why so picky? Snacks are snacks."

"Nu-uh!" She shook her head emphatically. "Cheap ones have bad chemicals. Ruins your skin!" Her tiny finger jabbed nutrition labels. "See? This has MSG! And that one – artificial coloring!"

Guan Yu's eyebrows climbed. This snack connoisseur operated on Michelin-star standards. No wonder she'd gone ballistic over crushed treats – each represented hours of careful curation.

His amusement faded when he noticed the watchers. Five men, their predatory gazes poorly disguised as casual shoppers. Cultivators, all of them.

"We'll finish next time," Zhang Han declared suddenly, hugging her mountain of selections.

Guan Yu froze. "Next... time?"

"Mmhmm! The cart's full!" Her innocent blink didn't fool him. This was a trap – the first of infinite "next times" until he became her permanent snack sherpa.

The cashier's scanner beeped relentlessly. ¥3,000 later, Guan Yu staggered under grocery bags while Zhang Han skipped ahead, already munching ¥50 lollipops.

The Da Hang's engine roared through neon-lit streets. Zhang Han whooped as Guan Yu slammed the accelerator, leaving their pursuers' black van eating dust.

"Faster, Uncle-in-law!"

He grinned despite himself. The girl had nerves of steel, munching imported shrimp crackers as they hit 130 km/h. When he suddenly cut lights and veered into woodland, she clapped in delight.

"Are we playing hide-and-seek?"

"Something like that." Guan Yu watched the confused van pass. "Let's see where they report failure."

The driver's frustrated call echoed through still night air: "Target lost."

As the van retreated northward, Guan Yu ghosted after them in silent pursuit. Beside him, Zhang Han's eyes shone with mischief, already plotting her next snack expedition.
