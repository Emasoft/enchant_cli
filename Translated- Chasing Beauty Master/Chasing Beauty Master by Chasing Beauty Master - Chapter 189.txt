Wen Qing’s face also turned extremely grim as she cursed under her breath, “Yang Yang, that bastard.”

A moment later, someone pressed a gun against Guan Yu’s forehead.

“Hey, hey, have you forgotten my existence? Do you think you can take him away without my permission? No one else gets to lay a finger on my target,” Lin Dong said irritably, the cigarette in his mouth nearly burned to the filter.

“Second Brother, I can’t take it anymore. I’m going to kill this guy today,” the young man declared.

With that, he turned and pulled the trigger at Lin Dong.

But the instant he turned, he saw a cluster of glowing sparks flying toward him, growing larger in his widening pupils.

“Ah—!”

“My eye!” the young man roared, clutching his right eye.

Seizing the perfect moment, Lin Dong swiftly closed the distance, disarmed the young man, and fired a shot at the person holding a gun to Guan Yu’s head.

*Bang!*

The gunshot echoed, and the man collapsed, a bullet hole between his brows.

Lin Dong then pressed the gun against the young man’s temple and warned, “I suggest none of you move, or his brains will decorate the floor.”

Guan Yu reacted just as quickly, pulling Wen Qing behind him and moving to Lin Dong’s side.

“You think this will make me obey? If he dies, none of you will survive,” the lead man growled darkly.

“Oh? In that case, you can die now. Your so-called ‘Second Brother’ clearly doesn’t care about your life,” Lin Dong said, his index finger resting lightly on the trigger, applying just enough pressure to threaten without firing.

“No! Second Brother, I don’t want to die!” the young man pleaded in terror.

“You… Fine. Let him go, and I’ll let you leave,” the man relented bitterly.

“Should’ve agreed earlier. You go first—I’ll cover the rear,” Lin Dong said, glancing at Guan Yu with a smirk.

“You…” Guan Yu hesitated.

“Only I get to kill you. They don’t,” Lin Dong laughed.

“Thank you,” Guan Yu said deeply, meeting his gaze before leaving with Wen Qing without another word.

**Chapter 467: The Slap Master**

Once they were far from the night market, Guan Yu finally exhaled in relief.

“Husband, will that man be alright? If it weren’t for him, we might not have made it out alive today,” Wen Qing said, her voice trembling with lingering fear.

Guan Yu’s palms were sweaty. Though he’d faced guns before, none of those encounters had been as perilous as this. Lin Dong’s confidence bordered on recklessness—had his shot missed or failed to kill, Guan Yu would’ve been the one dead. But such was the difference between a master and an amateur.

As for whether Lin Dong would escape unharmed, Guan Yu harbored no doubts. A man who remained composed under the threat of a dozen guns was beyond his comprehension.

“He’s far more terrifying than we imagine. Those men are no match for him,” Guan Yu said with a faint smile.

“What exactly is your relationship with him? One moment he wants to kill you, the next he saves you?” Wen Qing asked, puzzled.

Guan Yu shook his head. Even he, as the person involved, didn’t understand. “Let’s go,” he said.

Wen Qing nodded.

But they hadn’t gone far when two figures lunged from the crowd, fists and feet aimed at Guan Yu’s back.

Guan Yu’s hair stood on end. He yanked Wen Qing forward, spun around, and unleashed the Three-Link Bone-Breaking Fist ultimate move. The attackers halted abruptly, avoiding direct confrontation.

They shifted sideways, striking at Guan Yu’s upper and lower body. Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed—they clearly knew his strengths and were targeting his vulnerabilities.

Blocking a punch with his right arm, Guan Yu seized the attacker’s wrist with his left hand and yanked hard, pulling the man off-balance. Activating his Gravity System at 40% weight increase, Guan Yu stepped forward, driving his knee into the man’s abdomen.

The man crumpled, retching and collapsing in agony. Switching to weight reduction, Guan Yu dodged the second attacker’s strike, circled behind him, and delivered a punch to the kidney. The man dropped like a stone.

Guan Yu sneered at the two on the ground. “Pathetic. Go home and train a few more years if you want to ambush me.”

Turning to Wen Qing, he froze. Her expression was strained, her eyes blinking rapidly.

“Wen Qing, what’s wrong?” he asked, confused.

“Run!” she urged.

“If you want your woman to die here, go ahead,” a cold voice spoke behind Wen Qing. A man stepped into view, half-hidden behind her, a gun pressed to her back.

Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened. “What do you want?”

“Come with us,” the man said.

Several more men emerged from the crowd, hands concealed, encircling Guan Yu.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Fine, I’ll go. But on one condition: let her go.”

“You’re in no position to make demands,” the man retorted.

Guan Yu’s eyes turned icy. “Then I won’t go.”

“You don’t care if she dies?”

“I care. But I’m not a fool. If she comes with me, she dies. If I don’t go, she might still die—but I’ll avenge her, and you’ll all pay,” Guan Yu said coolly.

“Don’t think your handful of men can stop me,” he added.

The man hesitated. Capturing Guan Yu in a crowded area was difficult, but his boss demanded Guan Yu’s presence tonight.

Finally, he nodded. “Fine. We’ll release her.”

“Husband, don’t!” Wen Qing pleaded.

Guan Yu gave her a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry. A fortune-teller once said I’m blessed with nine lives. Remember: don’t leave the banquet early again. Look at the trouble it’s caused.”

With a meaningful glance, he let the men march him away at gunpoint.

Left alone in the bustling crowd, Wen Qing frowned, replaying Guan Yu’s words and final look.

*“Don’t leave the banquet before it ends…”* She muttered it repeatedly.

*Trouble… The storage room!* Her eyes widened. Earlier, Lin Dong had mentioned Guan Yu’s bodyguard was locked in the hotel’s storage room. Guan Yu was hinting for her to find his bodyguard for help.

Realization struck. Wen Qing sprinted toward the banquet hotel.

**Chapter 468: Comfortably Numb**

Guan Yu was taken to an isolated villa far from Kyoto’s bustle. Bound and seated in the lavish living room, he awaited his captor.

“Hahaha! Guan Yu, you’ve finally fallen into my hands!” A manic laugh preceded Park Xu’s entrance.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “You?”

“Surprised? You should’ve expected this when you crossed me,” Park Xu sneered, his smile venomous.

“Not really. I figured it was you—just didn’t expect such audacity. This is China, not Korea. You’ve overstepped,” Guan Yu said dismissively.

“Still arrogant, even now?” Park Xu spat.

“Don’t worry—I won’t kill you quickly. That’s too merciful. I’ll make you beg for death!”

“Madman,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Mad? You did this to me!” Park Xu’s eyes blazed. “You humiliated me over women, at dinners, during charity events—you destroyed my reputation in China. Now you’ll pay.”

Guan Yu lounged lazily. “As a professional slap-giver, I specialize in smacking shameless people. You’re exceptionally shameless—seems I’ll have to keep slapping.”

**Chapter 469: The Monster**

Park Xu’s face twisted. “You’ll get no more chances.”

“Planning to silence me?” Guan Yu narrowed his eyes.

“Beg, and I’ll make your death quick.”

“Was Lin Dong your man earlier?”

“Lin Dong? Who’s that?”

A whispered update from a bodyguard clarified matters.

“Oh, that failed assassin? Yes, I hired him. Pity he was incompetent—letting you live this long,” Park Xu scoffed.

“So it was you.” Guan Yu’s gaze turned murderous.

Park Xu shuddered involuntarily but pressed on. “You deserve worse! Because of you, I’m half-crippled!” He gestured furiously at his groin.

“Take him to the freezer. I’ll watch him freeze to death—slowly!”

…

Guan Yu initially found Park Xu’s plan amusing. With his healing system, cold meant nothing. But his smugness vanished when stripped to his underwear and thrown into a subzero chamber.

*Damn psycho,* he thought, activating his healing system to generate warmth.

Park Xu watched through glass, cackling. “How does it feel, Guan Yu? This is poetic justice!”

Guan Yu pretended to shiver while secretly reveling in the cold’s manageable drain on his energy.

Enraged by Guan Yu’s resilience, Park Xu ordered the temperature lowered further. When told it was already at -50°C, he snarled, “Electrocute him!”

Metal clamps snapped onto Guan Yu’s wrists. He feigned agony as electricity coursed through him—but inwardly rejoiced. The shocks replenished his energy.

“Hah! This feels amazing!” he thought, convulsing theatrically.

Park Xu’s laughter echoed. “Suffer, you bastard!”

Unbeknownst to him, Guan Yu was thriving, the voltage secretly fueling his healing system. The monster in the ice wasn’t Guan Yu—it was Park Xu’s own deranged vengeance.
