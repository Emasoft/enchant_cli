Jiù Bùyùn sighed in relief. She had finally defeated the cunning Shen Sheng, but killing him now felt too merciful after he had toyed with her for so long.

“Boy, seems you’re not so tough after all,” she sneered, cracking her knuckles. “No time for games now. I’ll truss you up first before helping the others.” Her search for rope proved futile.

Resigned, she resolved to knock him unconscious. Yet as she approached, a pragmatic thought struck—wouldn’t execution be safer? Having grown up in a mountain bandit stronghold where bloodshed was commonplace, she saw no moral quandary. But then Bier Lin’s words echoed: *Living captives fetch higher ransoms from Guan Yu.*

“A massive fortune…” The words rolled sweetly on her tongue. She grinned down at the gasping Shen Sheng. “Seems your hide’s worth keeping after all.”

The young man glared helplessly, his abdomen throbbing from her earlier strike. As Jiù raised her hand for the knockout blow, danger prickled her senses—a crimson blade materialized like bloody lightning at her flank!

With preternatural reflexes, the First-Class Sovereign cultivator twisted aside. The phantom edge still grazed her arm, drawing first blood. Before her stood Second-to-Wolf, his earth-toned cloak billowing without wind.

**Chapter 2813: Timely Rescue**

The crimson blade’s aura chilled bones. Shen Sheng recognized this warrior who’d once repelled Guan Yu’s assassin at Qiao District. “Save my juniors first!” he urged through gritted teeth, ignoring his own peril.

“All will live,” Second-to-Wolf declared. His blade became a scarlet comet streaking toward Jiù. Though weaponless, the bandit queen dodged with feral grace—until the warrior’s follow-up strike.

*Schlick!*

The blade skewered her left arm. A brutal twist reduced the limb to crimson mist. Jiù’s agonized scream echoed as she collapsed.

“By the heavens…” Shen Sheng paled at the gory spectacle.

**Chapter 2814: Contained Threat**

In the courtyard, three battered disciples formed a bleeding triangle. Big Beard leaned heavily on his staff, five gashes weeping crimson. “Flee without me!” he growled.

Xiao Bai shook his head, blood dripping from a split lip. “Guan Yu comes.”

Their attackers paused as Second-to-Wolf materialized behind leader Yuan Shanding, blade kissing his throat. “Order retreat,” the warrior commanded, “or lose your head.”

Yuan’s Adam’s apple bobbed against cold steel. “Stand down!”

As Xiao Bai tended to Big Beard’s mangled shoulder, Second-to-Wolf kept vigil. “Move and die,” he warned the cowed bandits.

**Chapter 2815: Aftermath**

The temple gateway revealed the battle’s toll—Shen Sheng meditated amidst blood-spattered stones, while Jiù slumped against a wall clutching her mangled stump. Crimson Rorschachs decorated the courtyard, each spray telling of Second-to-Wolf’s merciless strike.

Xiao Bai shuddered at the carnage. “Senior Brother…”

Shen Sheng opened bloodshot eyes. “The others?”

“Safe.” The younger monk swallowed bile. “Thanks to Second-to-Wolf.”

Jiù’s glare burned across the gore, but her remaining hand stayed still—sealing qi points to staunch the bleeding. The game had changed, and the bandit queen knew when to bide her time.
