Wang Jun was truly vexed. He hadn’t expected that coming here to claim ownership would result in such humiliation from an artifact spirit. The injustice burned, yet he dared not vent his anger—this was entirely the other’s domain, and Wang held no right to protest here.

“If you refuse, then so be it. There’s no need to humiliate me like this, is there?” Wang Jun pouted. “If you’re unwilling, fine! I can’t be bothered claiming ownership anyway. Once I leave, I’ll toss this Dragon’s Eye Amber into a cesspit. Let you stew in filth for eternity—see how you like that!”

“Oh ho! I hadn’t pegged you for such a spiteful little creature,” the artifact spirit retorted, eyes narrowing. “You’re far too weak. I am the spirit of an immortal artifact—how could I possibly accept a feeble master like you? Save your breath; this is absurd.”

It seemed genuine disdain—and perhaps unavoidable. As the spirit had said, an immortal artifact would never bow to someone so insignificant. Reality was cruel.

Frustration gnawed at Wang Jun, yet he had no recourse. How could he compel this half-ghost, half-human entity to submit? If Guan Yu were here, perhaps...

Outside, Guan Yu observed Wang’s motionless form. No movement, no response—how strange. Entering a magical artifact’s space, especially a desertscape, should allow instant assessment: presence of a spirit, success or failure in claiming ownership. Why this prolonged trance?

“Wang Jun? How goes it?” Guan Yu whispered. No reaction—Wang might as well have been asleep.

“Are you alright?” Guan Yu nudged him gently. Still nothing. Unease prickled.

By all logic, even if Wang’s soul had entered the artifact, cutting off external senses, he should still perceive being called or touched. At minimum, he’d emerge to report.

Trapped inside? In danger? If so, disaster loomed—a soul unrecovered would leave Wang a lifeless husk.

Guan Yu resolved to act. Wake Wang, whatever the cost. Ownership matters shouldn’t require this long.

Reaching for the Dragon’s Eye Amber, Guan Yu found an invisible barrier shielding it. Panic surged—he couldn’t even touch the artifact!

Desperate, Guan Yu placed hands on Wang’s shoulders, channeling spiritual energy through the young man’s arms toward the amber. Perhaps severing the connection...

“Why the hurry? Isn’t this place delightful?” The artifact spirit smirked as Wang pleaded for release. “You disturbed my centuries-long slumber. I shan’t let you leave so easily.”

“I came to claim ownership. Since you refuse, I’ll depart!” Wang retorted. “Besides—do you even need sleep?”

A being without physical form shouldn’t require rest—clearly, the spirit invented excuses.

“My ‘sleep’ is cultivation,” the spirit sniffed. “Time flies thus. As for you...” A mocking chuckle. “Pathetically weak. Laughably so.”

Suddenly, Wang felt violent suction pulling him backward—as if grabbed from behind.

The spirit’s eyes flashed. “Escape? Not so simple!” With a wave, the pulling force diminished, replaced by winds thrusting Wang forward.

Outside, Guan Yu sensed resistance but pressed harder, spiritual energy flooding Wang’s meridians.

“Oh? This one’s interesting,” the spirit mused. “Stronger than you, certainly. Let’s test his mettle.”

The spirit raised a hand—magnetic force pinned Wang midair. Agony tore through him as opposing forces pulled body and soul apart.

“Stop! You’re killing me!” Wang screamed. Guan Yu’s external pull and the spirit’s grip threatened to rend him asunder.

“Enough,” the spirit sighed. “I’d hate boring corpses.” Releasing Wang, the backlash hurled Guan Yu against a wall.

Ignoring his own bruises, Guan Yu rushed to Wang—now slumped over the table, the amber clattering floorward.

“Wang Jun! Wake up!” Shaking him fiercely.

Eyelids fluttering, Wang groaned: “Guan Yu?... Did you... nearly tear me in half?”

“I tried rescuing you! What happened?”

“Nightmare.” Wang shuddered, retrieving the amber. “The spirit... shape-shifting hermaphrodite, waist-down missing... called me idiot, chatterbox... but finally relented.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “So the mighty Wang Jun got schooled by a ghost?”

“Laugh while you can! It said its realm expands with thought—mountains materialize at whim. I blinked and stood before a pagoda!”

“Fascinating.” Guan Yu grew serious. “But since claiming ownership failed...”

Wang grimaced. “It mocked my weakness. Original owner’s likely alive—the spirit implied as much.”

“Then keeping this treasure...” Guan Yu frowned. “Elder Xuanming will demand it. Unless...”

“No!” Wang clutched the amber. “I won’t surrender it!”

Yet both knew—some forces cannot be resisted.

**Chapter 4704: Nearly Lost My Life**

The spirit’s sudden release sent Guan Yu crashing. Wang’s revival came with bitter realization: without Guan Yu’s intervention, he’d have been trapped indefinitely.

**Chapter 4705: Unkeepable**

Wang’s retelling painted the artifact’s wonders—realms shaped by thought, a capricious spirit defying mortality. Yet Guan Yu saw deeper implications: an immortal’s lost treasure, its true master perhaps still roaming.

“If the original owner lives,” Guan Yu mused, “this amber cannot truly be yours. Xuanming’s reach is long...”

Wang’s grip tightened. “Then we hide it! Develop countermeasures!”

But in their hearts, both youths understood—some storms cannot be weathered. The Dragon’s Eye Amber’s brilliance might illuminate their path briefly, yet like moonlight on water, no hand could clutch its glow forever.
