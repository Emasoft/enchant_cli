**Chapter 4053: Only One Way**

The current situation was far more manageable than the previous night. At the very least, escaping wouldn’t be an issue for Guan Yu.

Guan Yu said, “The situation is highly complex. Your Highness, please wait here while I assess the circumstances outside. Rest assured, the enemy won’t storm in for now.”

Zou Wuhui immediately asked, “How can you be so certain? After firing those incendiary arrows, they’re clearly preparing for a full assault.”

“You’re mistaken,” Guan Yu replied. “The reason they launched fire arrows to probe us is precisely because they’re unaware of our defenses. Had the Imperial Guards known our vulnerabilities, they would’ve charged in already. Their hesitation and continued use of fire tactics indicate they intend to flush us out rather than risk entering. This proves their reluctance to engage directly.”

Xiao Zhi interjected, “Then why not confront them head-on? They’re mere minnows—nothing to fear!”

Guan Yu shot Xiao Zhi a sidelong glare. The man spoke recklessly, heedless of his own standing. True, Guan Yu and his companions could likely scatter the enemy with a few spells, but doing so would expose their identities. Unless absolutely desperate, they had to remain concealed. The Manor Lord and others exchanged skeptical glances, uncertain whether this bold child’s confidence was genuine or mere bravado.

**Chapter 4053: Only One Way**

Prince Zou declared, “Old Cang speaks wisely. Let us remain calm and devise a proper strategy. For now, we stay put. The enemy dares not act rashly.”

Changing the subject, Guan Yu asked, “Manor Lord, how many carriages does Proud Heaven Manor possess?”

The Manor Lord paused, perplexed by the question, but answered, “We have roughly seven or eight serviceable carriages.”

“Excellent. That’s sufficient,” Guan Yu said. “Please ensure they’re safeguarded immediately. Those carriages may become our lifelines—they must not be destroyed by fire.”

Many frowned in confusion. If fleeing were the goal, wouldn’t horses be faster than cumbersome carriages? Yet Prince Zou trusted Guan Yu implicitly. “Manor Lord, oblige him. Old Cang serves as our strategist—his word guides us.”

The Manor Lord nodded hastily. “Of course, Your Highness. I’ll dispatch men to guard the stables. The carriages are stored at the rear, beyond the reach of frontal fire arrows.”

“Time is critical,” Guan Yu urged. “Wait here—I’ll scout outside.” With that, he slipped out.

The night blazed with firelight, but Proud Heaven Manor’s scattered buildings spared it total ruin. Only a few structures burned uncontrollably. Scaling the outer wall, Guan Yu found the grounds eerily vacant—the Imperial Guards had withdrawn. Two archer teams lingered near the gates, while the main force waited afar, poised to strike once the prince’s group emerged.

This played perfectly into Guan Yu’s plan. With carriages creating diversionary paths, the enemy’s numerical advantage could be fragmented. Spotting movement among the distant troops, Guan Yu dared not linger. He vaulted back inside, avoiding potential arrow volleys.

Returning, he found all eyes upon him. Prince Zou feigned composure, but Guan Yu recognized the prince’s concealed agitation—a leader masking fear with calm.

“Old Cang, did you encounter the enemy?” Prince Zou pressed.

Guan Yu nodded. “As reported, two archer teams guard the walls. The main force observes from the southern hillside. Given Proud Heaven Manor’s location between two slopes, they’ve taken position on the gentler southern terrain.”

Zou Wuhui suggested, “Why not send our men to eliminate those archers?”

“Too risky,” Guan Yu countered. “Their main force could descend swiftly. We’d lose more than we gain.”

Prince Zou paced. “They aim to drain our resources and morale before striking.”

“Precisely,” Guan Yu agreed. “Though cautious after last night, we cannot idle here. I’ve conceived a plan requiring all carriages.”

He dipped a finger in tea and sketched on a table. “Your Highness, observe. We position carriages at the gates, then charge out simultaneously. Spread them across divergent routes—the enemy won’t know which holds you. Their forces will scatter in pursuit. Speed is vital; capture means death.”

Pausing, he added, “I’ll escort your carriage with my child. Assign others to remaining vehicles—two per carriage at minimum.”

Prince Zou paled. “This seems perilous. If caught…”

“You must also exchange robes with a decoy,” Guan Yu continued. “Let them draw the enemy’s focus.”

Though risky, the plan was their sole option. Prince Zou’s expression darkened—this gamble might doom Proud Heaven Manor itself.

Wang Jun proposed, “We could enhance the ruse by disguising all carriage occupants.”

**Chapter 4054: Scatter and Flee**

“Elaborate,” the Manor Lord urged.

Prince Zou nodded. “All ideas are welcome. Let us refine the optimal strategy.”

Wang Jun explained, “Since we’re using multiple carriages, maximize confusion. Under night’s cover, outfit everyone in similar garb to Your Highness. The Manor Lord can provide duplicate robes. With false beards via my disguise techniques, each decoy will resemble you.”

Though clever, this required twenty sacrificial souls—carriage crews unlikely to survive pursuit. After debate, the Manor Lord assembled carriages at the gates. Disguised passengers boarded, armed with bows to harass pursuers.

Routes were assigned: Guan Yu and Zou Wuhui accompanied the prince; Wang Jun paired with Xiao Zhi; captains divided among other carriages. The Manor Lord provided maps, outlining dispersal points after crossing a river.

Guan Yu objected, “Our carriage should backtrack. The enemy expects forward flight—reversing course may evade attention.”

Finalized, the grim plan unfolded. Volunteers stormed the archers, exploiting their close-combat weakness. Gates burst open—eight carriages surged forth like arrows.

From the hillside, the Imperial Guard commander roared, “They’re fleeing! Pursue! Leave none alive!”

Though outnumbered, the carriages gained ground on Proud Heaven Manor’s smooth approach. Pursuers bottlenecked downhill, picked off by rearward arrows.

“There’s Prince Zou!” a soldier shouted as wind billowed a carriage curtain. Yet identical figures appeared in multiple vehicles, paralyzing the commander with indecision.

“Split into five units!” he finally ordered. “Each squad chase one carriage! None escape!”

Most troops gave chase, but the commander lingered, suspecting a ruse. “The prince might still hide within! Storm the manor!”

His remaining force slaughtered Proud Heaven Manor’s defenders. Captured and maimed, the Manor Lord died without betrayal, his estate erased from the martial world by dawn.

**Chapter 4055: Collateral Damage**

The fleeing carriages employed deadly archery, exploiting night and chaotic pursuit. After fording a river, they scattered further. Imperial Guards split accordingly, prioritizing forward routes.

Guan Yu’s backtracking carriage soon outran pursuers. Baffled, he halted—why no chase? Ahead, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi also paused.

Prince Zou fretted, “We must press south to Haler City!” Secretly, he regretted detouring to Proud Heaven Manor. Had they proceeded directly from Lianzhou City, this catastrophe might’ve been avoided. Instead, they’d doomed allies without gaining strength.

“Old Cang,” the prince asked guiltily, “do you think they’ve destroyed the manor?”

Within the rattling carriage, Guan Yu gripped the reins, the weight of collateral damage hanging heavy as they raced toward uncertain refuge.
