The Demon Lord put away the Myriad Phenomena Disk. With nothing pressing to attend, he decided to visit Wang Xiaorong. "That girl has been holed up in her room ever since returning last time. Who knows what she's up to? I should check on her," he muttered to himself.

Arriving outside Wang Xiaorong's chamber, he called softly, "Rong'er, are you inside?"

"Father, do you need something?" came the reply.

"Can't I visit without reason? Open the door—I'm coming in." He pushed against the door, finding it bolted from within. "Locking your door in broad daylight? Are you fearing danger within our Demon Soul Sect?"

"Coming, coming! Just a moment—I'll open it right away!"

Shortly after, Wang Xiaorong opened the door. "What brings you here, Father? Come in."

"All this secrecy—what are you doing in here?" The Demon Lord eyed her curiously as he entered.

"Nothing much. Just bored. You won't let me go out—what else can I do?" she replied.

"Bored... in your room?" The Demon Lord studied her. Having raised her for years, he instantly detected her lie. "Since when have you ever stayed cooped up quietly? Do you take me for a fool?"

Wang Xiaorong stuck out her tongue silently. "What mischief are you brewing here? Out with it!" he pressed.

His gaze fell on a wooden block and wood shavings littering the table. "Why are you carving wood? What's this for?"

In truth, Wang Xiaorong had been studying the hand crossbow design Guan Yu mentioned. When he'd departed Zhouji City last time, she'd insisted on accompanying him until he dissuaded her by giving her a copy of the crossbow schematics.

Of course, Guan Yu had warned her the designs were crucial and must remain secret—especially from the Demon Lord. After returning to the Demon Soul Sect, she'd pored over the diagrams daily, now attempting to carve wooden components, hoping to craft a wooden replica as a keepsake for Guan Yu.

This project alone kept her indoors—otherwise she'd have long since escaped to roam freely. Hearing her father's approach, she'd hastily hidden her work, but traces remained on the table.

"Oh, this? Just whittling statues for fun," she fibbed.

"You? Idle hands? Your mind's always with Guan Yu. Since when do you take up crafts?" he challenged.

Lifting the tablecloth, he discovered various wooden pieces and two papers underneath. Wang Xiaorong panicked: "Father! Don't rummage through my things!"

"I only want to know what you're hiding. What harm in looking?" He retrieved the papers.

"What's this? These diagrams?" he inquired, squinting.

"Ugh, you wouldn't understand. Just a toy I'm making!" She snatched back the papers.

"Toy-making? You think you can fool me? Since childhood, your only 'toys' were bullying others!"

Realizing evasion was futile—and that her father would eventually uncover the truth—Wang Xiaorong bit her lip, mentally apologizing to Guan Yu.

"These are plans for a 'hand crossbow'—Guan Yu's invention. A type of hidden weapon," she confessed.

The Demon Lord reclaimed the papers, studying them. "Strange shape. What complex mechanism is this?"

"It's called a hand crossbow. Guan Yu made me swear secrecy. Now that you know, you mustn't tell anyone! If he discovers this betrayal, I'll never hear the end of it!"

Resigned, she reasoned partial disclosure was safer if her father kept quiet.

"Again with Guan Yu! Must every matter involve him? His name alone gives me headaches," the Demon Lord grumbled.

"Then stop asking questions! You pressed me for answers!"

He sighed. Though disinterested in Guan Yu's schemes, curiosity gnawed him. "Very well—explain this device's purpose."

Wang Xiaorong brightened. "It's immensely powerful! Though I've not seen it, Guan Yu claims superior potency to his firearms. If mass-produced, it could drastically enhance our sect's combat strength!"

The Demon Lord recalled recent news—Xuanming summoning True Sun Sect elders. Now the pieces connected. "So this is why they sought True Sun's expertise... But can you replicate it? Even if successful, a wooden model would be useless."

"Let me take these to Left Envoy. He might—"

"No!" She seized the papers. "Guan Yu swore me to secrecy! He promised me a personalized version later. We should wait and reverse-engineer that perfected model instead!"

"Trust that scoundrel?"

"Absolutely! Mass production for Cloud Azure Sect will take ages. Meanwhile, Guan Yu will supply us. Premature leaks would endanger him—Cloud Azure executes informants!"

After deliberation, the Demon Lord conceded. "Very well. But what progress have you made?"

Wang Xiaorong proudly displayed wooden components. "See? The crossbow body matches the diagrams perfectly!"

"Well-crafted. My daughter's focus bears fruit." He smiled ruefully. "When you receive Guan Yu's crossbow, inform me immediately."

Post-visit, the Demon Lord summoned Left Envoy. "Cloud Azure collaborates with True Sun Sect on a 'hand crossbow'—reportedly surpassing firearms. Monitor their movements closely."

Left Envoy frowned. "Stronger than firearms? Unthinkable! Their concealed workshop in back mountains must be the production site."

"Keep utmost secrecy. Mobilize all spies—I want constant updates."

Shifting topics, the Demon Lord produced the Myriad Phenomena Disk. "Meanwhile, many gather in the desert awaiting Miao City's appearance. Take Salt Marsh and secure our position. Eliminate troublesome competitors."

"As you command."

Elsewhere, Guan Yu and Wang Jun collaborated with Elder Wang on crossbow development. The elder had identified the armor's shoulder and chest plates as rare ironstone—legendary material for forging superior magical instruments.

Elder Wang entreated Guan Yu: "This ironstone quantity is unprecedented! Might I have some? My assistance comes freely, but..."

Guan Yu smiled. "You forget—Cloud Azure commissioned you. This ironstone's value? Priceless. Five million taels seemed exorbitant, yet here we sit on a fortune."

The elder's eyes gleamed—no merchant would've sold such treasure at any price. For cultivators, ironstone meant power... and Guan Yu held the mother lode.
