Wang Jun hurriedly said, “Guan Yu, don’t jump to conclusions. The truth is, we split the gold the prince gave us out of necessity—we were broke! You’ve got plenty of money, so I figured you wouldn’t mind, right? That’s why we divided it between us.”

“You’re right. I don’t mind,” Guan Yu replied expressionlessly. “Precisely because I don’t care, there’s nothing more to discuss. Go rest.”

Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi exchanged glances. Guan Yu’s tone made it clear he was upset—a bad sign. As their pillar of support, Guan Yu’s current aloofness unnerved them.

In truth, Guan Yu genuinely had no interest in the gold. The prince’s future rewards would undoubtedly be substantial. If they successfully escorted him to the capital, a hefty reward awaited them. Guan Yu was playing the long game; while the current gold was considerable, he didn’t urgently need it.

Yet Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi grew more anxious the calmer Guan Yu appeared. Wang Jun knew the consequences of angering Guan Yu—a slow, excruciating torment without visible cause.

Guan Yu glanced at them. “Why are you still here? Anything else? If not, go rest. You didn’t sleep all night—aren’t you tired?”

After a moment’s hesitation, Wang Jun pulled out five gold ingots and placed them on the table. Guan Yu asked curiously, “What’s this?”

“Guan Yu, you know us—we’re not greedy. We just got carried away seeing so much gold and split it without saving your share. Are you upset?” Wang Jun explained.

Xiao Zhi quickly added his four ingots to the pile, silent but watchful.

Provoking Guan Yu would spell disaster. Even Xuan Ming avoided crossing him. Xiao Zhi now grasped the weight of Guan Yu’s influence.

No one who knew him dared provoke him, and those who did met grim fates—Elder Zheng being a prime example.

Guan Yu chuckled, surprised by their actions. “What’s this? Pitying me? Do I look that greedy or poor?”

“Not at all!” Wang Jun clarified. “This gold was meant for all three of us. Dividing it without you felt wrong. How should we handle it?”

“I lack nothing. You keeping it is as good as me having it. Why fuss? Though you didn’t tell me, do I seem that petty?” Guan Yu said wryly.

He had intended to let them keep the gold to ease future negotiations for larger rewards. Their overthinking amused him.

“You’re really not angry?” Xiao Zhi ventured. “I thought you were upset we took the gold. Glad you’re not.”

Wang Jun suggested, “We don’t need this much gold on our journey, but everyone loves it. Let’s pool it under your care and draw from it as needed.”

“No need for formalities. The prince didn’t specify recipients. Keep what you’ve taken—I truly don’t need it.” Guan Yu waved dismissively, amused by their caution.

Xiao Zhi glanced at Wang Jun, relieved.

Wang Jun laughed. “Good, you’re not angry! I knew you weren’t petty.” He reclaimed his five ingots. Xiao Zhi followed suit, saying, “We’ll hold onto the gold. Use it whenever needed.”

“Gold’s useful, but moderation suffices. Wang Jun may need materials for more crossbows later. Keep it,” Guan Yu advised.

Xiao Zhi asked eagerly, “Can you make me a hand crossbow? Wang Jun’s looks impressive.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow at Xiao Zhi using “high-end.” Wang Jun boasted, “This treasure isn’t for everyone. Rarity defines value—don’t you know that?”

“Father said the Yunqing Sect plans to issue them widely,” Xiao Zhi countered.

“Even then, yours would be peashooters next to mine,” Wang Jun smirked. His collapsible crossbow, refined with Guan Yu’s expertise, was a masterpiece.

“Mine’s like a high-grade magical artifact. The sect’s mass-produced ones will be ordinary—no comparison.”

Xiao Zhi scoffed, “You keep the best for yourselves and give scraps to disciples?”

Guan Yu retorted, “Crafting quality crossbows requires premium materials. The sect’s scale demands common materials—be realistic.”

Wang Jun added, “The Yunqing Sect’s mass production is a massive undertaking. Basic materials are already a feat—where would they get advanced ones?”

Guan Yu had an idea. Elder Zheng, a century-old cultivator, must have hoarded rare materials at Xuanyun Peak.

“Xiao Zhi, ask Elder Zheng for materials. With good ones, I’ll craft you a powerful crossbow. Superior materials mean deadlier force.”

Xiao Zhi nodded. As Elder Zheng’s son, he could request materials post-mission.

“After this task, I’ll get materials from Father. I want a crossbow like yours!”

Wang Jun blurted, “Mine’s nothing! Guan Yu has a better one.” He demonstrated his collapsible crossbow.

Guan Yu stopped him. “Don’t flaunt it. If the prince covets it, we’ll have trouble.”

“Why should I hand it over? I’m not his lackey!” Wang Jun scoffed.

“They’ll claim it threatens the prince’s safety. Avoid provoking them,” Guan Yu warned.

Reluctantly, Wang Jun fired a bolt through the doorframe. Xiao Zhi gaped at the embedded arrow.

“Impressive, right?” Wang Jun grinned. “But the specialized arrows are costly.”

Xiao Zhi marveled, “With this, why cultivate spiritual power? It’s incredible!”

“Exactly!” Wang Jian agreed. “I considered embedding a dark crystal to store spiritual energy—boost its power!”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Unnecessary. A crossbow’s strength lies in surprise attacks. Charging spiritual energy wastes critical moments.”

Xiao Zhi begged, “Make me one! Even a basic model!”

Wang Jun snapped, “You think it’s easy? We slaved over these! They’re not laundry!”

Xiao Zhi turned to Guan Yu. “Yours must be for Wang Xiaorong, right? Show me!”

Guan Yu reluctantly produced a miniature crossbow. “Keep this secret.”

**Chapter 4008: The Plump Woman**

Xiao Zhi stared. “So small? How’s it stronger than Wang Jun’s?”

“Size deceives,” Wang Jun said. “Remember Guan Yu’s pistol? This crossbow’s deadlier.”

Xiao Zhi recalled the pistol’s lethal range. “I want one!”

A servant interrupted, summoning them to the prince’s banquet.

In the hall, a massive table stood beside an outdoor stage. Spotting a woman backstage, Wang Jun asked, “Doesn’t she look like Du Bingyan?”

Xiao Zhi agreed, but Du Bingyan was busy mourning her parents.

In a dilapidated courtyard, Du Bingyan knelt between two coffins, burning paper money in silence. Chickens clucked nearby as she grieved, abandoned by relatives after her family’s downfall.

Wang Jun’s gold leaf had spared her the indignity of a pauper’s burial. Alone, she kept vigil, tormented by guilt and loss.
