Though Liu Chuntian (Spring) was also startled, she fared slightly better than the innkeeper. After all, her grandfather was undeniably a mage.

“How wonderful! Now when I go out with Grandfather again, I won’t have to worry about carrying things!”

“By the way, Brother Longzu (Dragon Clan), didn’t you say you subdued that witch? Where is she now?”

At that moment, Guan Yu suddenly remembered something. He hurriedly removed the spatial ring from his finger and said, “You’re right—I nearly forgot her! If we don’t let her out soon, she’ll suffocate in there!”

He was referring to Lang Duhua (Wolf Poison Flower), who had been trapped inside the spatial ring for a full hour. Who knew what state she was in now?

When Guan Yu aimed the ring at the ground and shouted “Release!”, a bound woman materialized on the previously empty floor.

Lang Duhua (Wolf Poison Flower) lay stiffly on the ground. After several minutes of observation by Guan Yu and the others, she began slowly writhing.

The wolf-woman now resembled frost-bitten eggplant—utterly wilted. Yet since she hadn’t reverted from her lupine form, her appearance remained unsettling.

Liu Chuntian and Amy stood far back, fearing the prone werewolf might suddenly leap up to sink fangs into their necks.

“Amy, don’t fear. She can’t attack anymore—I’ve sealed her clavicle meridians to prevent transformations.”

No sooner had Guan Yu spoken than Lang Duhua threw back her head with a bestial roar. Her ferocious gaze swept the group before settling on him.

“You bastard! Even if I die, I’ll never let you go!”

Hearing her threats, Bikamao hopped before her. “Witch, if not for Boss’s mercy, I’d have electrocuted you already! Yet here you spew ingratitude!”

“You’re no better—all crows are black! Whatever monster you are, kill me and the Warwolf Mercenary Corps will hunt you to the ends of the earth!”

“Oh? Is Cat Lord here so dashing? Forget you chasing me—your whole corps pursuing me for life? How embarrassing!”

“Smooth talkers indeed! The upper beam crooked, the lower beam follows—birds of a feather flock together!”

“Who are you calling ugly, you hag?!”

Lang Duhua lifted her head to see the speaker—a delicate-looking girl. It was Amy. As Guan Yu’s die-hard fan, how could she tolerate insults against him?

Of course, Lang Duhua wasn’t one to back down. The slur ignited her fury. “You brat! If these ropes weren’t binding me, I’d teach you proper manners!”

“Exactly! Helpless and friendless—that just proves your uselessness!”

Amy’s increasingly venomous retorts stunned Lang Duhua. None around Guan Yu were normal—martial experts, cunning talkers, each capable of inflicting torment.

“I won’t stoop to your level. Kill me if you will—I’m at your mercy!”

To Guan Yu’s surprise, Lang Duhua offered no resistance now, as if resigned to her fate.

Still, he remained cautious. Werewolves were notoriously treacherous—Lang Tianhua (Heavenly Wolf) exemplified this, and Lang Duhua would’ve poisoned him already if not outmatched.

“Brother Guan Yu, where’s my father?”

Liu Chuntian’s sudden question startled him. He hadn’t seen Liu Yishou (Skilled Hand) since their separation at the mass grave. Had the werewolves captured him? If so...

Guan Yu’s face fell. He smiled awkwardly at Liu Chuntian. “Well... Sister Chuntian, I don’t know your father’s whereabouts...”

“Did you lose my grandfather? Has something happened? Brother Guan Yu, answer me! What’s wrong with Grandfather?!”

“Sister Chuntian, don’t panic! Brother Longzu will think of something! Grandfather’s blessed—he’ll be fine!”

Amy’s comfort rang hollow. Guan Yu knew Liu Chuntian’s deep bond with her grandfather, her only family since childhood. Anyone would despair in her place.

As anxiety gripped them, a voice called from outside: “Worry not—I’m here!”

Relief flooded the room. Tears streamed down Liu Chuntian’s face as she rushed into Liu Yishou’s arms. “Grandfather! Where were you? We waited hours—we were so afraid!”

“There, there. See? I’m unharmed. Thanks to Young Master Guan Yu’s aid—he had me flee while facing the werewolves alone. Without him, I’d be dead!”

Liu Chuntian glanced guiltily at Guan Yu. “Forgive me, Brother Guan Yu! I wrongly accused you earlier. Please don’t be angry!”

Her earnest apology melted any irritation. “No harm done. Anyone would react similarly—it shows your deep love for family. You’re a good girl.”

“Hehe, if you keep praising me, I’ll blush!” She ducked her head shyly.

Changing the subject, Guan Yu addressed Liu Yishou. “Uncle Liu, where did you go after escaping the graves? Why return so late?”

“Young Master, I tried fleeing toward town under your cover, but injuries slowed me. Worse, I got lost after half an hour. When I turned back to find you, I heard voices deep in the forest.”

“Voices? The Warwolf Corps?”

“No... but certainly not locals.”

“Not them? Then trouble brews for the town. How many?”

“Thirty or more, led by a white-bearded elder and youth in his twenties.”

Guan Yu nodded, foreboding chilling his heart.

“Brother Longzu, what’s wrong? Should we leave if it’s dangerous?”

He longed to depart, but Amy’s month-long poison deadline anchored them. Failure meant catastrophe.

“Brother Guan Yu, do you know these people Grandfather mentioned?”

“Uncertain. Many fit that description here.”

“What now, Young Master? Any plans?”

“The Warwolf Corps bears grudges. Lang Tianhua will return with reinforcements, and with this captive...” He gestured at Lang Duhua. “We must prepare thoroughly.”

“Boss! The Corps’ strength is fearsome—even regular members challenge us. Their next assault could overwhelm us!”

“Obviously! Got any bright ideas?”

“We have her.” Bikamao nudged Lang Duhua with a paw. “Let’s trade her for Locke to cure Amy! Use her as hostage!”

“A decent plan... but would the cunning Warwolves agree?”

“Consider this—she’s one of few female members. Rare equals valuable. Locke’s just a sheltered elf they exploit against his kin. Their bond’s transactional—no loyalty. Her worth outweighs his.”

Guan Yu smiled at Bikamao’s shrewd analysis. “Continue.”

“If wrong, we’ll exploit their mutual distrust. Turn them against each other!”

Applause interrupted them—Liu Yishou. “Young Master, your cat speaks wisdom!”

“Old man!” Bikamao bristled. “I’m Bikamao, not ‘your cat’!”

“Ah, forgive me. Bikamao’s stratagem is brilliant! A masterstroke sowing discord among foes!”

“Obviously!”

Guan Yu chuckled at their bickering. “Enough! We’re in mortal peril here!”

“Brother Guan Yu, if Amy and I burden you, leave us behind. The werewolves won’t target us.”

“Sister Chuntian! We’d never abandon you! Have faith in Brother Longzu!”

Amy’s earnest plea redirected attention to Guan Yu, who sighed inwardly—the kind girl’s heart warred with practicality.

“Sister Chuntian, Uncle Liu, rest assured. Even if we part later, I’ll secure your safety first. Our meeting was fate—you’re family now.”

Moved, Liu Yishou bowed deeply. “Your kindness surpasses ours. The Liu family shall never forget this debt. Virtue rewards the virtuous!”

As the old man began kneeling, Guan Yu stopped him. “Uncle! You shame me! I help friends and kin. In this world... you’re all I trust.”

His words stirred them, though questions lingered about his mysterious solitude. Noticing their curiosity, Guan Yu smiled wryly.

“You wonder about my family? I miss them dearly.”

“Then why not seek them, Brother Guan Yu?” Liu Chuntian asked.

“How? I don’t even know where they are.”

“Are they... far?”

“Beyond any distance you know.”

Their bafflement amused him. Only Bikamao shared his secret.

“Is your home... not on Lammai Continent?”

Gasps followed his nod.

“Correct. I hail from another world—Earth. No magic, no elves, only humans and technology surpassing your arts.”

Their stunned silence greeted tales of cities destroyed by bombs, moon landings, and instant communication.

“But... how defend without magic?”

“Through science—mightier than spells. Yet I’ve no way back. I miss... embracing my wives.”

Blushing, Liu Chuntian averted her eyes. Liu Yishou coughed, changing subject. “Let’s focus on evading the Warwolves!”

Noticing Amy’s sudden silence, Guan Yu approached. “What’s wrong?”

She stared ahead, unresponsive.

“Such a frown mars your beauty.”
