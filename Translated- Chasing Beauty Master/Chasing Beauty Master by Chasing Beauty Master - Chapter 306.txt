“Guan Yu is indirectly covering the medical expenses, which is also a way to prevent Wen Ya from investing too much time into work. If Wen Qing knew about this, she’d surely praise him for being a somewhat useful chairman!”

“Since you love dancing so much, you must long for a bigger and broader stage. The upcoming centennial school celebration is a perfect springboard to let your talent shine and be discovered. If you miss this, there won’t be a second chance.”

Guan Yu patiently persuaded step by step.

Originally, he thought curing Wen Ya’s mother would make Wen Ya agree to his request. Little did he expect Wen Ya to withdraw into such an extreme, almost pathological state, which gave him a headache.

Wen Ya stared deeply at Guan Yu, hesitating for a long time.

“Besides, you acknowledged me as your boyfriend at school, using me as a shield. Now part of the attention from your admirers has shifted to me. Even if I’ve done nothing praiseworthy, you have no reason to refuse me!”

Wen Ya walked forward slowly, a faint smile curling at her lips.

“Fine, I agree!”

Her clear, elegant voice floated into Guan Yu’s ears, making him sigh in relief. He’d been worried Wen Ya would remain stubborn.

“Let’s go get medicine for your mother!”

**Chapter 774: Evil Overcomes Courage**

Wen Qing had been exceptionally busy lately.

With the centennial school celebration approaching, Wen Qing effectively became the student council president, exhausting herself to ensure smooth operations. Additionally, she temporarily took over as lead dancer due to a vacancy.

Today, she personally attended dance rehearsals. Watching the playback, her brows furrowed deeper—something felt missing in the performance.

After a long while, she shook her head self-deprecatingly. “I just don’t have the talent for dance.”

“Who says my wife lacks talent? I think you dance beautifully!” A teasing voice came from behind.

Wen Qing turned to see Guan Yu, snorted, and looked away.

Guan Yu hugged her from behind, inhaling her fragrance. “Darling, why ignore me?”

“You know why!” Wen Qing retorted.

“Every successful woman has a hardworking husband. This ox never slacks!” Guan Yu joked.

“Oh? With so many fields to plow, how could you slack?” Wen Qing rolled her eyes.

Guan Yu turned her around seriously. “Let’s discuss business.”

“Oh, so you remember business? I thought you’d forgotten after wallowing in luxury!” Wen Qing fumed.

“Did you convince Wen Ya?”

“No. Maybe I should join the dance instead,” Guan Yu quipped.

“Using your charm to seduce everyone?” Wen Qing teased.

Suddenly, commotion erupted as everyone turned to the entrance.

Wen Ya appeared, dressed simply yet stunningly. Murmurs filled the room.

“Why is Wen Yal here? To rehearse?”

“No way. She refused earlier.”

Wen Ya approached Guan Yu. “I’m late due to work.”

“No worries. Your mother’s condition is stable. Focus on dancing.” Guan Yu reassured her.

Wen Qing glared at Guan Yu. “You lied to me!”

“Let’s start rehearsals,” Wen Qing said to Wen Ya.

News of Wen Ya’s participation spread rapidly, causing a sensation. Crowds flooded the rehearsal hall.

Meanwhile, Zhan Shouwang seethed with rage upon seeing photos of Guan Yu and Wen Ya online. “I’ll make you regret crossing me!”

**Chapter 775: Trouble Strikes**

Wen Songbai’s煎饼 stall was destroyed by城管 (urban management officers). Beaten and hospitalized, his right leg fractured.

“Who did this?” Guan Yu demanded, fury simmering.

“Rehabilitation Hospital,” answered Bald Qiang.

At the hospital, Guan宇 stormed in, pulling Wen Ya outside. “We’re settling this now!”

**Chapter 776: Confrontation**

Wen Ya felt utterly exhausted. Her father’s injury and legal battles against corrupt officials crushed her spirit.

“Let’s confront them!” Guan Yu declared, dragging her toward retribution.
