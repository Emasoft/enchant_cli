“Oh? Then this matter has become complicated. We need to slowly gather evidence.” The police officer spoke while opening the crippled man’s phone. After fiddling with it for a moment, he suddenly roared, “Are you mocking me, brat? There’s nothing in your phone! You claimed to have recorded footage of the scene? I think you’re the troublemaker here!”

“Impossible! I clearly recorded it earlier. How could it be gone?” The crippled man snatched back his phone, intending to search for the video he’d captured.

But upon holding the device, he immediately realized the problem—the phone was completely empty, restored to factory settings like it was brand new. Only then did he understand these officers were colluding with their adversaries. The policeman hadn’t been searching for the video earlier but formatting the device.

“You…” The crippled man trembled with rage, clutching the phone. He knew he was doomed. Without surveillance footage or recordings, he couldn’t clear his name even with a hundred tongues.

The officer bellowed, “You’re clearly here to cause trouble! Arrest both of them!”

Qian Yunqing reacted belatedly, finally realizing these officers conspired with the blond-haired youth inside to fabricate this chaos. Yet when the police moved to detain him, he couldn’t possibly resist—that would compound his charges. As two officers handcuffed Qian and the crippled man, an ambulance arrived outside.

Only one ambulance came, insufficient to carry all dozen injured. The gravely wounded girl lying on the floor was prioritized. Meanwhile, officers escorted two detainees outside. Hou Jinshun stared in shock—Qian Yunqing and the Yu Gang member now wore handcuffs. What was happening?

Just as Hou stepped forward to inquire, the blond-haired youth swaggered out triumphantly. Everything became clear: these officers were accomplices targeting Qian Yunqing.

Hou’s mind raced. He couldn’t let them take Qian away—once in custody, a beating was inevitable.

**Chapter 2646: Punctured Tires**

“Comrade officers, I witnessed the incident inside. As a citizen, I’m willing to provide testimony,” Hou Jinshun declared, blocking their path.

An officer narrowed his eyes. “Unnecessary. This comrade”—he gestured to the blond youth—“will provide a detailed account.”

“Delighted to cooperate,” the youth chimed smugly.

Though Hou itched to kick the grinning provocateur, he remembered Guan Yu’s warning: avoid violence that could justify arrests. The priority was stopping this sham.

Hou retreated discreetly, “found” a nail, and placed it beneath the patrol car’s tire. Once the vehicle moved, the puncture would immobilize them. From a distance, he called Guan Yu, who replied, “I saw everything. I’ll contact connections to secure their release. Wait.”

Guan Yu then dialed Lin Qiaoqiao. “Qiaoqiao, when will you arrive? This is urgent!”

“Big cities have traffic jams at night—don’t you know?” came her harried reply. “I’m almost there after dropping off that pest.”

The patrol car started, lurched five meters, then BANG!—the tire exploded under sudden acceleration. Cursing officers inspected the damage as Hou approached, all helpful innocence. “Terrible blowout! I’m a mechanic—need help changing that spare?”

Gratefully, they opened the trunk. Hou “worked” with theatrical efficiency... for fifteen unproductive minutes. Distant sirens announced Lin Qiaoqiao’s arrival. Her patrol car halted outside the internet café.

“Which precinct are you from? Sightseeing?” Lin’s voice cut like ice. The officers gaped—this stunning beauty wore a detective captain’s insignia.

“We responded to a disturbance here,” one stammered. “Detained the instigators.”

“This café’s owner is my friend. Who dared cause trouble?” Lin’s tone sharpened.

The officers exchanged nervous glances. “Perhaps you should contact your friend directly...”

Lin had prepared. “This is my jurisdiction. Hand over the detainees.” When they resisted, she played her card: “Cooperate, and I’ll ensure you’re credited. Refuse, and I’ll report your obstruction.”

Meanwhile, Hou sabotaged the spare tire. “Disaster! This replacement’s defective too!”

As officers panicked, Lin pressed her advantage: “Your vehicle’s immobilized. Transfer the prisoners to me—I’ll owe you a favor.”

Temptation flickered in their eyes. Lin leaned closer, voice honeyed. “What if I sweeten the deal? Generous compensation... and personal gratitude.”

One officer gulped. “How... generous?”

“Ten thousand each. Cash.” She produced an envelope. “Keep this between us.”

Their resolve crumbled. “Well... since the car’s unusable...”

**Chapter 2647: Bribes and Betrayal**

“You’re hindering official duties!” Lin’s glare intensified. “Persist, and I’ll pursue this to the fullest.”

The officers wavered—though higher-ranked, Lin couldn’t override their jurisdiction. Yet her dual offer of cash and future favors proved irresistible.

“Our superiors assigned this,” one muttered weakly, though his partner’s gaze lingered on Lin’s beauty.

“Five thousand upfront already lines your pockets,” Lin purred, stepping closer. “Double that, plus... flexibility regarding my ‘appreciation’.”

The blond youth erupted as they transferred prisoners. “Why release them?!”

“Our car’s dead. Another unit handles this now,” an officer snapped, avoiding his gaze.

**Chapter 2648: Fury**

In her Volkswagen Beetle, Xue Jing glared as Lin flirtatiously winked at Guan Yu. “Stay away from that vixen!” she hissed.

Guan Yu, still dazed by Lin’s charisma, mumbled agreement. The blond youth raged impotently as Qian and the crippled man walked free—Lin’s “gratitude” having bought their liberty.

Lin’s satisfaction came not from bribing fools, but aiding Guan Yu. Now, she anticipated his... thorough gratitude.
