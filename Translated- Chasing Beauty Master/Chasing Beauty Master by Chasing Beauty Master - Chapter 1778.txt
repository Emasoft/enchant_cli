“The elders of the True Sun Sect grew impatient. ‘We’ve claimed this Blood Stone,’ one declared. ‘Disciples—retrieve it. Attack anyone who dares obstruct us.’

The Red Lotus Sect immediately tensed. Elder Zhao warned, ‘Approach further, and we’ll show no mercy.’

Ignoring him, two True Sun disciples advanced toward the Blood Stone, eyes locked on the Red Lotus members.

‘Prepare the Red Lotus Formation!’ Elder Zhao roared. ‘Hear this clearly: today, we’d rather perish than let anyone seize the Blood Stone!’ Behind him, disciples swiftly arranged themselves into battle positions.

Spell formations—meticulously designed by masters—were the Red Lotus Sect’s hallmark. While joint spellcasting wasn’t uncommon, their formations optimized power and speed by positioning each disciple at critical nodes. Some spells even required specific formations to unleash their full devastating potential.

**Chapter 4651: Ill Intentions**

The True Sun elder, observing the Red Lotus’s mobilization, cast shimmering shields over his two advancing disciples. Guan Yu’s eyes widened—unlike the typical dome-shaped shields here, these resembled *eggshells*, identical to the rebound-capable shields he himself once wielded.

‘Remarkable technique, Elder,’ Guan Yu pressed. ‘What’s this shield called?’

‘That’s confidential,’ the elder replied tersely, eyes fixed on the Red Lotus. Guan Yu studied the shields, baffled. *How could spiritual energy replicate a shield designed for internal qi?*

As tensions peaked, Xiao Mei emerged nearby. ‘Guan Yu! What’s happening? Weren’t you trapped in Miao City’s forbidden zone?’

‘Not now,’ Guan Yu dismissed, nodding toward the impending clash.

Azhe interjected politely, ‘The Miao Chief hasn’t returned. We…found an escape route.’

‘A secret tunnel,’ Guan Yu added, cutting off further questions. ‘Let them fight. Observe.’

The Red Lotus formation glowed ominously, while the True Sun disciples stood shielded. Guan Yu noted the elder’s calm—why not disrupt the enemy’s spell?

‘We adhere to honor,’ the True Sun elder explained, sensing Guan Yu’s curiosity. ‘As righteous sects, we strike only *after* being attacked.’

Guan Yu nodded, though others might deem this chivalry foolish.

The Red Lotus spell erupted—a colossal ice mass materialized above the True Sun ranks. The elder’s disciples linked hands, summoning a tornado-like barrier. Winds roared, deflecting the ice’s trajectory. Though the shield shattered, the redirected debris caused minimal harm.

‘Astounding!’ Xiao Mei gasped. ‘That ice would’ve crushed me!’

Guan Yu smirked. ‘Desert life has narrowed your horizons.’ Privately, he marveled—the elder’s foresight had neutralized the Red Lotus’s strike perfectly.

**Chapter 4652: An Eye-Opening Spectacle**

‘Why are *righteous* sects fighting?’ Xiao Mei pressed.

‘Over that.’ Guan Yu pointed to the Blood Stone. ‘A mere rock. Not worth your schemes.’

The True Sun elder taunted, ‘Your tricks won’t deter us. The Blood Stone goes to the strong.’

Elder Zhao retorted, ‘We’ll perish before yielding!’

Guan Yu watched coolly. *Let them exhaust each other. The stone may yet fall to me.*

The True Sun disciples channeled spiritual energy through interlinked hands, conjuring a cyclonic shield. When the Red Lotus hurled a glacial mountain, winds sheared it into harmless fragments. Ice melted; leaves settled.

‘Today’s clash was…educational,’ Guan Yu remarked.

Xiao Mei shuddered. ‘My sect wouldn’t survive such power.’

**Chapter 4653: Unyielding Pride**

The True Sun elder hid his relief—had the Red Lotus been at full strength, his barrier would’ve failed. ‘Your spells impress,’ he conceded, ‘but we’ll test your resolve once more.’

Elder Zhao, though weary, stood firm. ‘We’ll fight to the last breath.’

Guan Yu lingered, plotting. *When both sides collapse, the stone becomes mine.*

The Red Lotus, though depleted, rallied. Another cataclysmic exchange loomed—one that would decide the victor…or leave none standing.”
