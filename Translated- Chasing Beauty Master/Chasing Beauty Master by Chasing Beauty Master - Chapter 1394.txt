Master Jiu shook his head and smiled. “I know you’re trying to comfort me, but don’t insult my intelligence. My junior brother was a formidable cultivator. Even if he wanted to return, he could easily tear open a dimensional rift with his magic.”

Yet as he spoke, Master Jiu began to find Guan Yu’s reasoning more plausible. The young man pressed, “That’s not necessarily true. Perhaps your junior brother was grievously wounded by demonic creatures and hasn’t recovered. He might lack the strength to perform advanced spells. I’m being serious—this isn’t empty comfort.”

A flicker of hope crossed Master Jiu’s weathered face. “Your theory isn’t impossible. But after all these years, any injury should have healed by now.”

“Consider this,” Guan Yu leaned forward. “The battle against demonic beings was no ordinary skirmish. Lingering wounds would be natural. Tell me—can cultivators truly traverse any realm they wish? Does tearing open dimensional rifts guarantee passage?”

“In principle, yes,” Master Jiu nodded. “But one must know their destination. Even the most powerful can’t guarantee precise rift formation. The opened rift might lead anywhere. It’s never absolute.”

“Could your brother have lost his way?” Guan Yu suggested. “Wandering between realms, unable to locate the correct rift. If so, he might still live.”

“Impossible.” Master Jiu’s denial carried decades of grief. “He’d never forget the return path. Unless... unless your earlier theory holds. Severe injury preventing rift creation—that I could believe.”

Guan Yu pressed his advantage. “How did you return, Master Jiu? If you were gravely wounded in another realm...”

The old cultivator’s eyes grew distant. “Fate intervened. When demonic forces cast me into that foreign realm, my injuries left me powerless. The spiritual energy there was thin, the air foul—ill-suited for recovery. Then... I met someone.”

“A friend?” Guan Yu’s curiosity burned.

“I awoke in a soft bed, bandaged and broken. A local girl named Yezi had found me bleeding by a riverbank. She nursed my body, but spiritual recovery proved impossible in that energy-starved world. My calculations showed a century needed for full restoration—time I didn’t possess.”

Master Jiu’s voice softened. “Yezi... she became my confidant. When I demonstrated cultivation arts, she believed my tale. Knowing I must leave, she devised a solution—an ice cavern where spiritual energy concentrated. For two years, she brought daily meals despite my protests. Through that icy sanctuary and her care, I recovered stronger than before.”

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. “This Yezi—she clearly loved you. Yet you left?”

Shame tinged Master Jiu’s admission. “My heart belonged to another—my martial sister here. Yezi understood. On parting, she said...” His throat tightened. “She said cherishing our time together was enough. But abandoning her haunts me still.”

“You never returned? Never sought her?”

“The realm’s name fades from memory.” Master Jiu turned away. “Some doors are best left closed.”

Shifting tactics, Guan Yu asked, “What of the demonic serpent you battled? Could it still threaten mortals?”

“A colossal viper—twenty meters long, armored scales. My junior brother fought it as I fell through dimensions. Its fate remains unknown.”

Recognition flashed in Guan Yu’s eyes. “I encountered such a beast! Lairing in a forest cavern, bearing ancient wounds beneath tumorous scars. Could it be the same?”

Master Jiu gripped his staff. “If gravely injured... yes. That you survived suggests our battle weakened it. Fortune favors you, boy.”

“Then I avenged you!” Guan Yu grinned. “Your serpent fell to my blade.”

The old cultivator’s laughter held bittersweet notes. “Strange how destiny unfolds. Without that battle, I’d never have met Yezi. Our paths weave through heaven’s loom—mortals merely follow the threads.”

Guan Yu studied the nostalgic gleam in Master Jiu’s eyes. “You still think of her. That gratitude... or more?”

“Enough!” Master Jiu rapped his staff, though his blush betrayed truth. “Why this sudden interest in ancient history?”

“Merely...” Guan Yu’s smile turned conspiratorial. “...seeking wisdom from your storied past. And perhaps... guidance to certain restricted archives?”
