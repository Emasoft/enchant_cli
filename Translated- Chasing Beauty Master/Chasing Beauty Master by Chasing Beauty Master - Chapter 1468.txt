“Guan Yu toyed with the pistol and said indifferently, ‘Perhaps none here have seen this object. It originates from my homeland and does not exist in these lands. Without exaggeration, this surpasses any magical artifact in potency. Its name is Desert Eagle, commonly called a handgun.’”

“‘This weapon of mine can kill an enemy within seventy meters in a single strike, consuming neither internal energy nor spiritual power. More remarkably, it can fire consecutively. At close range, the projectile may penetrate multiple foes, potentially injuring two or even three with one shot.’”

Though many found his words incomprehensible and dubious, Guan Yu’s earlier demonstration of a Battle Qi Slash kept dissenters silent. Meanwhile, disciples of Zuokong Peak grew restless as their master remained unresponsive.

Xiaotong of Juhe Peak tugged Siqi’s sleeve, exclaiming, “Look! That object in Guan Yu’s hand—last time in Black Blood Ridge, he used it to instantly kill the Blood Lord!” Siqi nodded silently.

Elder Dai observed meaningfully from afar, while Elder Xiang steadied himself behind his shimmering protective shield. The eight-meter distance between combatants felt precarious yet manageable for spellcasting.

As Guan Yu leveled the silver firearm’s dark muzzle at Elder Xiang’s forehead, Xiaotong gasped behind her hands. Siqi cried out, “Guan Yu! No killing!” Her familiar voice echoed through the crowd.

“I never intended his life,” Guan Yu murmured, remembering his promise to preserve Elder Xiang’s spiritual power for Xiao Zhi’s treatment. The enraged elder, however, channeled frost energy through his iron ruler, conjuring a glittering ice blade above Guan Yu’s head.

The crowd held its breath—until a thunderous BANG shattered the silence. Disciples screamed as smoke curled from Guan Yu’s weapon. Elder Xiang collapsed, howling, his left leg pierced clean through by the mystical projectile.

“Merely a warning shot,” Guan Yu declared, watching blood pool around the elder’s wound. The Desert Eagle’s fearsome reputation solidified as onlookers grasped its instantaneous, invisible lethality.

When Siqi blushed at his public acknowledgment of obeying her plea, Guan Yu turned to the groaning elder: “Remember our wager—fifty years of spiritual cultivation for Xiao Zhi’s cure.”

As Zuokong disciples carried their master away, Sect Leader Xuanming examined the smoking weapon with keen interest. “This ‘handgun’... if replicable...”

Following a thorough spiritual inspection confirming Guan Yu’s purity, Xuanming denounced the traitorous Yan Zhao. Guan Yu recounted his narrow escapes from poisoned meals and ambushes, omitting only the Emperor Seal’s role in containing the forbidden Eight-Drum Art.

Throughout the proceedings, Elder Lu watched anxiously until Xuanming’s verdict: “No trace of demonic influence remains. The Eight-Drum Art never took root in his body.” Relief washed through the assembly as the sect leader issued execution orders for the absconded traitor.

Guan Yu bowed, the Desert Eagle gleaming at his hip—a foreign marvel now inextricably woven into the tapestry of cloud-piercing peaks and ancient rivalries.
