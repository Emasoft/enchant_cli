Thus, Zhao Hu could follow the trail and gain a general understanding of Liu Bingrong's background. Guan Yu's actions were solely aimed at dispelling Zhao Hu's concerns.

Having his thoughts guessed and being bailed out by Guan Yu left Zhao Hu somewhat embarrassed. He forced a smile and said, "This matter is easy to handle. When does Brother Guan plan to set up your father-in-law?"

Guan Yu pondered for a moment before replying, "He's a chronic gambler. I suppose he frequents casinos. Once he steps into Brother Hu's casino, we can act. Notify me then, and I'll go watch a good show."

Zhao Hu chuckled. "Brother Guan, just wait at home. When your father-in-law enters my casino, I'll inform you immediately."

As for why Guan Yu wanted to trap his father-in-law, no one cared. What mattered was Guan Yu's favor.

With business concluded, Guan Yu and Zhao Hu exchanged pleasantries. The three had a late-night meal to bond before parting ways.

Zhao Hu, now sober, turned to Chen Bao, who had reappeared, and asked, "How did you handle that kid?"

Chen Bao replied respectfully, "I threatened him to follow Guan Yu's instructions. I'll monitor him closely. If he falters, he'll taste some fists."

Zhao Hu nodded. "Handle this carefully but make it seem arduous. Ensure others remember your 'kindness'."

Chen Bao nodded in understanding.

Zhao Hu massaged his temples, eyes closed. "Investigate that kid's father. Deliver their family details by tomorrow morning. Monitor all casinos for his father's presence. Find ways to lure him into our casino quickly. Since Guan Yu requested it, we can't let him doubt our capabilities."

Chen Bao hesitated. "Brother Hu, must we help Guan Yu so earnestly? His influence is vast but irrelevant to M City."

Zhao Hu smiled cryptically. "Consider it an investment. Better to befriend such people than enemies. When I need help later, Guan Yu won't refuse. Remember, M City isn't solely ours. The other two factions eye our profitable casinos. With Guan Yu as an ally, we might counter them."

Chen Bao remained skeptical.

Zhao Hu added meaningfully, "Interest is the best bond for friendships like ours."

In the presidential suite, Guan Yu studied Zhao Hu's profile, frowning.

Lin Dong lounged, eating grapes while watching cartoons. "Find his status acceptable?"

Guan宇 shrugged. "Not just acceptable—he's a mini-overlord here."

"Smells like a wolf in sheep's clothing," Lin Dong remarked.

Guan Yu disagreed. "He wants me indebted to tackle M City's other factions. With me, his position strengthens."

"Fetching your wife home for New Year comes at a cost," Lin Dong chuckled.

"Call it inviting wolves instead," Guan Yu retorted.

Lin Dong raised an eyebrow. "Already eyeing M City while Taiwan's unfinished?"

Guan宇 grinned. "By the time M City needs me, Taiwan will be mine."

Lin Dong scoffed. "Ambitious."

Guan宇 shrugged. "Small ambitions can't protect those I care about."

Lin Dong fell silent.

The next evening, Zhao Hu informed Guan Yu that Liu Bingrong, flush with cash, was gambling heavily.

Guan宇 surmised the money's origin, growing angry. He and Lin Dong headed to the casino.

Zhao虎 welcomed them, showing Liu Bingrong's gambling via a hidden camera.

Liu Bing荣, initially winning big, soon faced a crushing downfall.

"Human nature's greed," Guan宇 remarked coldly.

"Time for the show."

Liu Bing荣's initial euphoria turned to despair as he lost everything, including borrowed funds.

Witnessing his father-in-law's ruin, Guan宇 felt no pity.

"Game over," Lin Dong said.

Guan宇 disagreed. "Zhao Hu will push him deeper. Let's wager on the duration."

They debated, eventually focusing on the screen.

Liu炳荣's luck turned catastrophic. Borrowing against his home, he lost 400,000 in minutes.

Overwhelmed by fear and debt, he collapsed—a victim of his own greed.
