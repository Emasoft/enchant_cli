When the gun muzzle pointed at him, Dake felt his heart turn cold, an overwhelming sense of insecurity gripping him. For reasons unknown, he detested this sensation intensely—it was as though his life now dangled in another's palm, perilously vulnerable.

The pitch-black barrel could discharge at any moment. In such circumstances, a gunshot wound would undoubtedly prove fatal, with no one present to aid him.

Guanyu pondered but couldn't lower his weapon. At the very least, this firearm restrained the two adversaries. Though no mortal enmity existed between them, maintaining this standoff seemed prudent. "You expect me to obey just because you say so?" he retorted. "Do you think you're still the big shot from the restaurant?"

"Alright, alright, brother!" Dake's entire body trembled visibly, his feigned terror almost convincing. "We haven't reached a life-or-death impasse. State your terms—I'll satisfy them however I can."

How could he not fear? Facing that ominous barrel, each passing second might bring his collapse. Anxiety churned within him like boiling water.

"Since we bear no deep grudges," Guanyu pressed, "explain your partnership. Are you two collaborators in crime?"

Before he finished speaking, Jinhua pointed at You Dun standing behind them. "Best not twitch," she warned. "At this range, even if stray bullets miss you, Dake's life hangs by a thread."

Observing You Dun's restless retreat toward the room, Jinhua maintained her vigilance.

Hearing this, Dake wheeled around furiously. "Stay fucking still!" he roared at You Dun. "Can't you see we're negotiating?" Yet his true concern lay elsewhere—whether Guanyu had alerted the authorities.

If tensions persisted without escalation, Guanyu likely wouldn't fire without absolute necessity. But should police already be en route, all their bargaining would prove futile. Prison gates might soon clang shut permanently on Dake's freedom.

"Approach," Guanyu commanded, gesturing with his pistol. Under Dake's threatening glare, You Dun reluctantly complied.

"Excellent," Guanyu nodded. "First question: Are you organized criminals? Was yesterday your first assault on female patrons? Detail your operations."

Cornered, Dake confessed through gritted teeth: "We've operated for years, targeting women exclusively. After...entertaining ourselves, we release them unharmed."

"Elaborate. Your methodology."

"You Dun's my cousin. After I started restaurant work, we devised this scheme. He takes night shifts to drug patrons using his...pharmaceutical skills. The sedated women are then delivered to me. Compensation seals his cooperation."

"So—kinsmen conspirators!" Guanyu mused, finding the account credible given Dake's palpable fear and coherent details.

Turning to You Dun, he pressed: "Who's your master? Don't lie—I recognize your knockout drugs."

"My master?" You Dun hesitated. "I never learned her name. Truly."

"Gender? Age? Whereabouts?" Jinhua interjected urgently.

"Female. Around eighty, maybe? Haven't seen her in years—honestly forgot until you asked."

"Disgraceful!" Jinhua snapped. "Forgetting your own master's age? Where's your filial piety?"

"She never mentioned it! When we met, she already seemed ancient. I'd nearly forgotten her existence."

"How did you meet? Why did she teach you?" Guanyu demanded.

"Five years back, when I was fifteen," You Dun began, sweat beading his forehead, "I hunted rabbits in distant North Mountain. Chasing a large hare into a cave, I stumbled upon..."

His tale unfolded—a cavernous space illuminated by flashlight, revealing an elderly woman entangled with a massive black serpent. Though terrified, he'd shot the creature under her desperate urging. The woman later gifted him a manual on poisoncraft, marking their first encounter.

"Half a year later," he continued, "she intercepted me on a street, confirmed I'd studied her text, and formally initiated me as her disciple. Gave me a bamboo ruler as token. Said she'd return in five years to assess my progress."

"Did she mention the Poison Mystic Sect?" Jinhua pressed.

"Yes! Exactly! She promised rewards if I mastered the manual within five years."

Jinhua rolled her eyes inwardly. Their sect ancestor had inexplicably taken this wretch as disciple? Rescuing her from a serpent didn't warrant such folly! She resolved never to reveal their shared lineage.

Guanyu chuckled at You Dun's visible trembling. "Snakes still frighten you?"

"Deathly afraid," came the shaky reply. "That black serpent haunts my dreams."

"And you never saw your master again?"

"Twice total. After the mountain, she ambushed me six months later—made me kneel in an alley, proclaimed me her pupil, then vanished."

As You Dun concluded, Jinhua fought to keep disgust from her face. This perverted coward—her martial uncle? Unthinkable. She'd guard this shameful secret to the grave.
