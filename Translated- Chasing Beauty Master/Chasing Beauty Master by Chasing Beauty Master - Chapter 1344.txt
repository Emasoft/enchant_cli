“Madam Qin and the other women hadn’t noticed anything amiss at the moment. With cheerful smiles, they said, ‘Exactly! We’re all family here. Make yourselves comfortable. Let’s eat first.’”

Guanyu pulled Siqi to sit beside him. Qin Taijin watched coldly, shooting Guanyu a venomous glare from the corner of his eye. “To think such a stunning beauty would follow this pretty-faced brat,” he seethed inwardly. “What a waste. I must find a way to get that exquisite creature into my bed.”

Guanyu feigned ignorance of Qin Taijin’s dark mood, not bothering to read his expression. “I should warn that scoundrel properly when I get the chance,” he thought. “If he dares flirt with Siqi again, he’ll have only himself to blame for the consequences.”

Qin Taijin proved himself a true bastard. Last night at Echo Pavilion, his disgusting leer at Wang Xiaorong had been nauseatingly vulgar. Now he set his sights on Siqi. Fortunately, he remained sober today, maintaining a facade of composure. Had he repeated yesterday’s drunken antics, Guanyu wouldn’t have hesitated to slap him before his entire family again.

Xiao Zhi sensed the thickening tension. What should have been a pleasant gathering now hung heavy with awkwardness.

During the meal, Qin Taijin asked, “Mother, did you send someone to fetch me last night when I was drunk?”

“Of course not! I didn’t even know where you were,” Madam Qin countered. “A young lady brought you home. Oh, she tended to you so attentively! Which family’s daughter was that?”

Qin Taijin naturally wouldn’t admit she’d been a paid companion. Mumbling evasively, he said, “I was too drunk. Don’t remember who brought me back.”

Guanyu interjected, “Young Master Qin, weren’t you drinking at Echo Pavilion? The girl who brought you back—I know her. She’s Xiao Bao, one of their entertainers.”

“What?” Madam Qin gasped. “An Echo Pavilion entertainer? What a pity! That girl seemed so refined and caring. I thought she came from a good family!”

Though initially impressed, Madam Qin’s expression soured upon learning Xiao Bao’s occupation. “And you!” she scolded Qin Taijin. “Stop frequenting such dens! Those places swarm with lowlifes—dangerous and beneath your station! What if rumors spread?”

Qin Taijin glared daggers at Guanyu, barely restraining himself from kicking the young man. “You insolent whelp!” he fumed silently. “Daring to expose me under my own roof! Just wait—you’ll pay for this.”

“Understood, Mother,” Qin Taijin replied smoothly. “The Zhao brothers insisted on taking me yesterday. It won’t happen again.”

Xiao Zhi redirected the conversation. “Aunt, what illness did Steward Chen contract before leaving?”

Madam Qin’s face darkened. “Ah, poor Uncle Chen... He suddenly developed a contagious disease. Rather than risk infecting the household, he chose to convalesce in his hometown. We provided funds, but haven’t visited yet.”

“But Uncle Chen was a cultivator! Despite his age, he’s always been robust. What contagion could fell him? Did physicians examine him?”

“Your uncle said physicians were consulted, but I don’t know details.” Madam Qin sighed. “He served our Qin family devotedly. We really should send someone to check on him.”

Seeing the lady knew little more, Xiao Zhi changed tack. “The current steward, Sun—was he someone you knew previously, or recommended?”

“Steward Sun came recommended by your uncle’s friend. They praised his loyalty and diligence. With your uncle traveling often lately, we needed reliable management.”

Guanyu’s eyes narrowed. An external recommendation—this confirmed his suspicions. These plotters first framed Uncle Chen, then installed Steward Sun. Only with Chen’s authority could Sun move freely to execute their schemes.

“Naturally,” Guanyu remarked. “Over seventy percent here belong to demonic sects. The Crimson Lotus Sect doesn’t even bother hiding—their red-garbed disciples flaunt themselves openly. They’re either fearless or fools, risking annihilation by revealing their numbers and stronghold.”

Xiao Zhi shook his head. “Not just demonic sects. Father mentioned True Sun Sect members have infiltrated too.”

“True Sun Sect?” Guanyu’s interest sparked. “Mysterious indeed—often heard of, never seen.”

“They arrived early but remain deeply concealed,” Xiao Zhi explained. “Weakest of the three orthodox sects, they avoid direct conflict with demonic forces through perfect camouflage.”

Guanyu assessed the factions. Currently, the Demon Soul Sect dominated as the strongest demonic branch. With the Blood Ridge Sect destroyed and the Monster Cave’s Twin Flower Demon Queens disinterested, only the elusive Blood Hunt Sect remained unknown.

Meanwhile, orthodox sects presented their own challenges. While Azure Cloud Sect sent only scouts, Crimson Lotus mobilized en masse, clearly desperate to claim the Eight-Sided Drum Technique for their own advancement—their mediocre reputation sustained merely by numbers.

“True Sun’s secrecy baffles me,” Guanyu mused. “Why not emulate Crimson Lotus’s boldness? Public presence could intimidate demonic forces.”

“They can’t afford losses like Crimson Lotus,” Xiao Zhi countered. “Father says True Sun’s leaders ignored Azure Cloud’s alliance proposals regarding the Eight-Sided Drum affair. Cowards!”

Aze snorted. “True Sun fears the demonic sects. They’ll only emerge if the technique surfaces—never proactively.”

Nodding, Guanyu concluded, “Then we stand alone. Crimson Lotus would sooner fight us than cooperate. Better rid ourselves of such ‘allies’.”

Siqi frowned. “If True Sun hides and Crimson Lotus schemes, does that leave Azure Cloud as orthodoxy’s sole true pillar? How did such timid sects gain equal standing?”

“Reputations are fickle,” Guanyu said. “Other sects might surpass us in secret. But—”

His words cut off as city guards marched through the street. Thirty soldiers pushed past bystanders, surrounding a Crimson Lotus tea house. “Arrest them all!” their captain barked.

Red-robed disciples protested as blades pressed their throats: “You dare target Crimson Lotus? You’ll regret this!”

“Silence!” the captain snapped. “We arrest exactly who we mean to!”

Nearby observers quickly spread the news—Crimson Lotus’s Yue Jing and Lai Lixia had crippled the city lord’s son over a stolen artifact. Enraged, Lord Men ordered all Crimson Lotus members expelled or arrested.

“This benefits us,” Guanyu told Siqi. “Crimson Lotus hindered more than helped. Let the city lord purge these obstacles.”

Xiao Zhi grinned. “Shall we visit the city manor? Perhaps ‘pay respects’ to the injured young lord while enjoying Crimson Lotus’s humiliation?”

“An excellent plan,” Guanyu agreed. “After lunch, we’ll witness their downfall firsthand.”

**Chapter 3476: Defiant to the End**

Qin Taijin wandered streets haunted by Siqi’s beauty—a rare flower he burned to possess. Heading to Echo Pavilion, he aimed to buy silence about last night’s drunken disgrace.

Entering the establishment, he demanded: “Fetch your madam. Now.”

A waiter scurried off, unaware this visit would ignite fires far beyond sealed lips and silver bribes.
