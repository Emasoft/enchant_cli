“Too many people would only alert the enemy,” Jiranzi Lang pondered. This vast area would be too cumbersome to search alone. Better to summon Guan Yu for assistance – perhaps they could comb through the entire region in one night.

“I called you here to help locate Ying Shan Gu. If you find her, don’t engage – just notify me.” Jiranzi Lang shot Guan Yu a sidelong glance tinged with reproach. “You ask me to work for free, yet surely you can spare this small favor?”

“Of course. It’s my duty,” Guan Yu replied cheerfully. “Your ability to trace Ying Shan Gu’s movements through such details is remarkable. I suspect she’s recuperating nearby while cultivating her poisons.”

“Precisely. To eliminate her swiftly, we begin now. Use this to communicate.” Jiranzi Lang handed Guan Yu a device resembling a flashlight.

“This tracker will alert me if you find her. Press the button, and I’ll pinpoint your location immediately.”

Nodding in understanding, Guan Yu cautioned, “Let’s proceed cautiously. Avoid her venomous creatures at all costs.”

After exchanging warnings, Jiranzi Lang vanished into the darkness. As Guan Yu and Xue Jing lingered, she asked, “Where should we start?”

“The chemical plant. Cultivating poisons releases distinct odors. Industrial smells there could mask her activities.”

Xue Jing agreed. “There’s a sizable plant north of the road we took. We should investigate there first.”

As they turned to leave, a cold laugh echoed behind them. “You’re Guan Yu, correct?”

They spun to see two strangers – men Guan Yu didn’t recognize, though the city had been flooded with outsiders lately.

Xue Jing clenched her fists. “Who are you? State your business!”

A gaunt man smirked. “We’re here for the treasure map. Hand it over peacefully, and we’ll all enjoy this lovely night.”

Guan Yu studied them – both lean with spiked hair and goatees, clad in identical black leather outfits and boots. Their only distinction lay in their hair: one snowy-white from scalp to eyebrows, the other jet-black.

Xue Jing recognized them instantly – the infamous twin bandits Da Bai (Great White) and Xiao Hei (Little Black), notorious among the Ten Great Villains of the martial world.

“The treasure map isn’t in my possession anymore,” Guan Yu said evenly. “Ying Shan Gu stole it. Surely you’ve heard?” He masked his tension – confronting these seasoned experts without backup risked Xue Jing’s safety.

In his prime, Guan Yu would’ve dispatched such villains without hesitation. Now, caution prevailed.

“Enough lies!” Da Bai snapped. “Our sources confirm you still hold a map. What Ying Shan Gu took is irrelevant – we want yours.”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. The existence of his decoy map was known only to four people. Had there been a leak?

Feigning innocence, he countered, “Two maps surfaced – one auctioned by the Yang Family, another stolen from me. You’re misinformed.”

Xiao Hei adjusted his pitch-black locks. “Don’t play coy. We know you bought the Yang Family’s map at auction.”

Guan Yu and Xue Jing exchanged startled glances – clearly, someone was framing them. Likely the Feng Family, diverting attention while undermining rivals.

Though Xue Jing showed no fear, the twins’ ruthless reputation warranted caution. Guan Yu continued calmly, “The Yangs sold their map to the Fengs – common knowledge. Why question verified facts?”

“Recent visitors to the Fengs left empty-handed,” Da Bai retorted. “Our information’s gold-standard. Produce the map or die here.”

When Da Bai demanded the tracker device, Guan Yu reluctantly tossed it over. Without Jiranzi Lang’s immediate aid and Xue Jing’s need to protect him, confrontation risked disaster.

“If I possessed the map, would I linger here?” Guan Yu spread his hands. “Facing legendary villains like yourselves, I’d flee instantly.”

The twins preened at their feared reputation. Da Bai sneered, “Flattery won’t save you. Hand it over!”

Knowing surrender meant death regardless, Guan Yu gambled: “The map’s elsewhere. Let my friend leave, and I’ll take you to it.”

“No!” Xue Jing declared. “I stay with you.”

“This isn’t negotiable,” Guan Yu insisted, but her resolute gaze silenced him.

Da Bai interrupted, “Neither leaves until we have the map. Try anything, and this wasteland becomes your grave.”

Assessing their prey – Guan Yu seemingly ordinary, Xue Jing disregarded – the twins grew impatient. Xiao Hei drew twin steel tridents glinting coldly in moonlight.

Guan Yu raised placating hands. “Lead the way then. But remember – kill us, and the map’s lost forever.”

As they moved through the desolate landscape, Guan Yu’s mind raced for escape plans. The Ten Great Villains’ resurgence – first Ying Shan Gu, now these twins – signaled deepening chaos. Whoever controlled the treasure map’s narrative controlled the storm engulfing the city. And in this tempest, survival demanded more than strength – it required cunning worthy of the legends themselves.
