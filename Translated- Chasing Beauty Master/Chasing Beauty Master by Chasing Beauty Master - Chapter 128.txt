“Fine… fine, have it your way. So tell me, what do you mean by all this now?” Guan Yu said helplessly, pursing his lips. Damn, a one-night stand at a bar actually led to another encounter. Looks like there's a high chance of getting stuck with her this time!

Though she's a beauty, they had no prior connection, and she was a little wildcat who enjoyed indulging herself. Guan Yu felt inexplicably awkward inside. Such women always struck him as unreliable.

“What do I mean? I'm naturally listening to you. Actually, after leaving the hotel that day, I regretted it... These past days, I kept wondering if we'd meet again. I've been captivated by you—I think I've fallen for you...” Wen Qing blinked her large eyes, gazing tenderly at Guan Yu as she spoke softly.

Guan Yu gulped hard. “Miss, you... aren't joking, are you?”

“Who's joking with you!” Wen Qing retorted seriously, tilting her head to look at him.

“You have a boyfriend! Besides, that night was just fooling around! We were drunk and lost control!” Guan Yu said with a defeated expression.

Wen Qing suddenly frowned, displeased. “What do you mean? Don't you want me?”

“It's not that I don't want you... but you already have a boyfriend!”

“Even married couples divorce. What's a boyfriend?” she argued stubbornly. “Besides, nothing happened between us! We barely held hands. I never had any feelings for him!” she pouted.

Guan Yu looked her up and down. “No feelings? Then why...”

“Agreed to be his girlfriend?” Wen Qing finished his hesitant question. “He pursued me since high school. Through college—freshman, sophomore year—I finally gave in from sheer persistence. But I made it clear from the start: if I ever found someone I truly liked, I'd break up immediately!” She tilted her chin defiantly.

“Ah... I see,” Guan Yu nodded. “But we don't know each other. You've known Xu Wei for years. If you wanted to hook up, wouldn't he be the logical choice?”

Wen Qing rolled her eyes. “I don't want him! I chose you. That night, I went drinking to vent. I was upset because he went whoring with classmates while lying about a birthday party! Angry, I went to the bar... and met you.”

Guan Yu nodded dazedly. “So you sought revenge on Xu Wei through me? Then it's simple! Our night was a mistake, a coincidence. Let's just forget it—”

Before he finished, Wen Qing pinched his sides hard. “After all that, you still deny responsibility? What's unworthy about me? I insist on being your woman—you can't escape!” She threw her arms around his neck, pressing her body against his.

Holy hell... What kind of mess is this?!

“Wait... I need clarity. What exactly is between you and Xu Wei—” Guan Yu needed answers. He couldn't stand ambiguity—what if she still carried feelings? The thought disgusted him. This was crucial!

Chapter 313: The Confession

Wen Qing's face darkened. “Why keep mentioning him?”

Guan Yu looked innocent. “I must understand your relationship. Even as my woman, do you still have feelings for him?”

“How dare you! Do I look like some promiscuous harlot?!” She pinched him fiercely.

“Didn't you say you sought me out because Xu Wei visited prostitutes? Would you care if you didn't feel anything?”

Wen Qing snorted. “I was furious! He claimed to love me yet sought cheap thrills elsewhere!”

“If you didn't love him, why care?” Guan Yu challenged, leaning back.

“I told you—I don't! I just couldn't swallow his hypocrisy!” She turned away angrily. “He pretended to protect me, knowing I'd never agree to his vulgar demands—”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “So you retaliated by sleeping with me? That's all?”

“Yes...” She nodded firmly.

“Then your 'feelings' are just revenge. Why claim to be my woman?!” He tried pushing her away.

“But I am your woman! I do like you!” She clung from behind, shouting stubbornly.

Coughs erupted from outside—Niu Le was choking in shock. Damn! His boss had seduced the student council's vice president—the ex-president's girlfriend—in mere minutes?!

Hearing this, Guan Yu flushed but couldn't shake her off. Turning, he met her gaze: “If I visited prostitutes, would you retaliate too?”

“Impossible! With me around, why would you?” She smiled confidently, chin lifted. As the campus belle—a stunning beauty even by entertainment industry standards—she brimmed with self-assurance.

“Hypothetically,” Guan Yu pressed.

“Then I'd bite you hard and lock you up! But I'd never seek others—I'm yours now.” She nuzzled against him sweetly.

Guan Yu massaged his temples. This girl truly meant to entangle him! But accepting a woman after one reckless night? Absurd!

“Listen, Wen Qing... I already have a girlfriend,” he declared solemnly.

She blinked tearfully. “Do you love her or me?”

Guan Yu's head throbbed. Love? After one night? Please!

When he stayed silent, she pouted mournfully. “Will you choose her... or me? You won't abandon me, will you? I'm your woman!”

He exhaled sharply. “I have three girlfriends. We live together. Get it?” He exaggerated to repel her.

Instead, Wen Qing beamed. “Perfect! Three more won't matter then!”

What the—?! Was this beauty brainless? Willingly becoming a concubine without foundation? It felt surreal.

“No more rejections! You're hurting me... husband...” She wrapped around his waist, gazing up pleadingly.

Guan Yu choked. Husband?!

“Wen Qing, that night—”

“Was my choice. You might think me loose, but I’m not! I was tipsy, but wouldn’t sleep with just anyone. Husband, you mesmerized me—your embrace felt so safe. How your friends respect you... You're a real man. Your scent... I’ve thought of you endlessly since that morning I left. The more I missed you, the deeper I fell...” Her earnest confession overwhelmed him.

“I know you don’t love me yet. But I’ll stay by you—just be kind, care for me... Let me feel loved. Once you know me, you’ll love me. I’ll be obedient, good to you...” She implored.

Damn—Guan Yu's mind short-circuited. Never had flattery and confession left him so dizzy!

Chapter 314: The Obedient Beauty

A gorgeous woman's heartfelt praise and confession—was this happiness or bewilderment? Guan Yu felt both.

Noticing his daze, Wen Qing giggled. “Touched? Will you accept me?”

He blinked. “Let me process this...” Fishing out a cigarette, he lit it—only for Wen Qing to swiftly light it for him.

“I’ll be good,” she promised, embracing him again. Her soft curves and floral scent muddled his thoughts anew.

Damn femme fatales! No wonder heroes fell for beauties' wiles throughout history!

“Let’s... try dating?” he conceded.

“Really?!” She beamed joyfully.

“Wait—you’re still Xu Wei’s girlfriend!”

“I’ll break up now!” She dialed immediately.

Guan Yu watched as she called Xu Wei. “Sweetheart... Why did you side with that guy? I—”

“Shut up!” Wen Qing coldly interrupted. “We’re done. I’ve found my man. You should be happy for me.”

Silence. Then frantic pleas: “Baby... what’s wrong? Did I upset you? I’ll change—”

“Stop. I never loved you. Goodbye.” She hung up.

“Satisfied?” She turned sweetly, demeanor transformed.

Guan Yu rubbed his nose. “Alright... for now. This is chaotic. I need space.”

Subdued, she nodded. “Your phone?” She programmed her number into his outdated device. “There—saved as ‘Sweetheart’!”

Linking arms, she declared: “Let’s go! I’ll organize the student council materials for you tonight. Don’t worry—I’ll manage everything!”

Dazed, Guan Yu let her lead him out. His three friends outside froze comically—their boss had conquered the campus belle in six minutes?!

“How?!” Wang Zhen gaped.

“Later.” Guan Yu extricated himself from Wen Qing’s clinginess. “I’ll find you,” she promised, departing reluctantly.

Watching her leave, the trio remained statuesque. “Let’s go!” Guan Yu urged.

“Boss! How?!” Wang Zhen pressed enviously.

Guan Yu sighed. This surreal reality required serious adjustment.
