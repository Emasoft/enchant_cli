Guan Yu shrugged indifferently. “Do as you please! But I’ll make this clear—I never provoke others unprovoked, yet if provoked, I eliminate them without mercy. The Song family had better not push me to madness. Otherwise, the consequences will far exceed your capacity to endure.”

His women were his reverse scales—inviolable!

He would never tolerate even the slightest harm or insult to them. Song Dawei stood as a living testament to this principle.

Ignoring Song Shaoqin’s darkened expression, Guan Yu paid for the wristwatch with his card and left the International Trade Center with Wenqing.

On their way back, Jiang Ziqi called.

“Young Master Guan, did you cripple Song Dawei?”

“Indeed.”

Guan Yu wasn’t surprised Jiang Ziqi knew. Given the commotion he’d caused, it would’ve been stranger if Jiang hadn’t heard. Likely, other factions in the capital already knew too.

“Why?” Jiang Ziqi paused, correcting himself. “I mean… the Song family isn’t simple. This matter won’t be easily resolved.”

“So what?” Guan Yu retorted. From the moment he crippled Song Dawei, he’d anticipated all repercussions. Reconciliation was never his intent. Moreover, he’d long known confrontation with the Song family was inevitable—this merely accelerated it.

Jiang Ziqi fell silent. Over time, he’d learned Guan Yu feared no strife. If Guan dared provoke the Song family, he naturally harbored no fear.

Perhaps this was a courage Jiang himself lacked.

Sighing, Jiang said, “Understood. Rest assured—I stand with you.”

**Chapter 999: Intimacy**

Seated in the passenger seat, Wenqing gazed at Guan Yu, her heart swelling with bliss. She and the others hadn’t fallen for him due to his looks, wealth, or capabilities, but because he loved them all equally. With him, they felt safe.

“Darling, though your husband is devilishly handsome, must you stare so intently?”

Guan Yu’s sudden teasing startled her. Blushing, she retorted, “Nonsense! You’re nowhere near as handsome as celebrities!”

“Pfah! Those pretty-boy actors? None compare to your husband!” Guan Yu sneered at the effeminate, delicate-faced stars he disdained.

“Hmph!” Wenqing turned away, though inwardly she agreed—her husband *was* the handsomest.

Noting her adorable pout, Guan Yu whispered, “Put on that evening gown when we get home. Let me admire you properly.”

Despite earlier unpleasantness, they’d purchased formal attire at another upscale mall. Wenqing’s snow-white gown, worth eight million, shimmered with gold and jewels yet accentuated her noble grace. Fitted as if tailored for her, it highlighted every curve.

Guan Yu had nearly regretted buying it—such beauty displayed publicly felt like gifting others a priceless view.

“You’ll see it tonight anyway. Why the rush?” Wenqing asked.

“But you’re irresistible in it! Please, darling?”

Amused by his childish pleading, she teased, “Very well, little brother. I’ll indulge you.”

**——**

Upon reaching the Wen residence, Guan Yu hurried Wenqing into changing.

“Why the urgency?”

Obliging, she donned the gown and glided toward him.

The dress, designed by a renowned master, had awaited its destined wearer. When Wenqing tried it on, the shopkeeper instantly recognized her as the muse, slashing the price from twenty million to eight.

Now, she radiated celestial allure—a vision that stole Guan Yu’s breath. His eyes fixated on her exposed neckline and hinted cleavage, mouth agape.

“Stop staring!” she chided, cheeks flushed.

“You’re breathtaking,” he growled, pulling her close, hands gripping her hips.

“Gently!” She lightly pounded his chest before yielding.

“I want you,” he murmured into her ear.

“But it’s daytime! Mother’s outside!”

“Then keep quiet.” His hands slid beneath her dress, fondling her breasts. “They’ve grown fuller.”

“*You* did this!” She rolled her eyes. His constant attentions had indeed enlarged them.

“Lovely. Women crave such curves, no?” His fingers teased her peaks, stoking her arousal.

“I’m no dairy cow!” she gasped, arms encircling his neck.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu lifted her skirt—

Knocking interrupted. Startled, he barked, “Who?!”

“Brat! Open up—it’s urgent!” Wen Baoguo’s voice boomed outside.

*Damn!* Guan Yu cursed inwardly. Of all times!

“Busy! Speak through the door!”

“Guan Yu! Come out NOW!” Wen Baoguo’s tone brooked no refusal.

“Go,” Wenqing urged, anxious about discovery.

“But I’m still hard!” He thrust upward, drawing a whimper. “Tonight—wear this dress again.”

“You fiend!” She smacked him, neither agreeing nor refusing.

Taking her silence as consent, he sighed at his unspent arousal. “Apologies, brother. Father-in-law trumps all.”

“What nonsense!” Wenqing blushed furiously.

**Chapter 1000: The Song Family’s Background**

Emerging disgruntled, Guan Yu faced Wen Baoguo’s glare. The older man snorted, well-aware of interrupted activities.

“Did you castrate Song Dawei?”

“Yes.” Guan Yu shrugged.

Wen Baoguo’s face darkened. “Must you act rashly?! Do you grasp the Song family’s power? The fallout?!”

“What fallout?”

Wen Baoguo’s tirade met infuriating calm. “The Songs’ influence is unimaginable! You’ve stirred a hornet’s nest!”

Grandfathers Wen Gongquan and Liu Jingguo entered, flanked by caretakers. Noting the tension, Liu snapped, “Bullying the boy again, Minister Wen?”

“He crippled a Song!”

“A *collateral* Song,” Wen Baoguo clarified.

“So? Weaklings deserve their fate!” the elders scoffed.

“But his sister married into Hong Kong’s Lee family! They’ll retaliate!”

The grandfathers frowned.

“Grandpa, who *are* the Songs?” Guan Yu asked.

Wen Gongquan explained, “Our nation values lineage. The Songs… recall modern history’s most prominent family?”

Guan Yu’s eyes widened. “The one that produced two first ladies?”

“Yes. Though believed disbanded after their exile, the Songs thrive abroad. Their Beijing branch liaises with their American and Taiwanese bases.”

“But they’re mere merchants!”

Liu Jingguo shook his head. “Red-topped merchants. Their wealth permeates national infrastructure and resources. Their collapse would shake the country.”

Guan Yu paled. The Songs’ deep-rooted influence meant war with them endangered the nation itself.

**Chapter 1001: Gathering Storms**

“For decades, they’ve embedded themselves in critical sectors,” Liu continued. “Their fortune rivals our treasury. Their reach mirrors America’s political financiers. We rise or fall together now.”

Guan Yu grasped the severity. The Songs’ tentacles choked vital industries—a stranglehold enabling extortionate demands.

Wen Gongquan concluded gravely, “Provoking them risks catastrophic chain reactions. Tread carefully.”
