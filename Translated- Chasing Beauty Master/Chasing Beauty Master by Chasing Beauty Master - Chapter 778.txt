“Yes, this is West Willow Village,” replied Passerby A.

Guanyu drove around aimlessly through the village. West Willow Village wasn’t particularly large, but neither was it small. The note from Jinhua had only instructed him to come here without specifying an exact location. Faced with an entire sprawling village, how was he supposed to find anything?

By noon, he still had no leads. Many villagers he asked about anyone surnamed Jin claimed no such family existed. Frustrated, Guanyu decided to drive back. Perhaps this was just one of Jinhua’s pranks—a diversion tactic? Still, with Xue Jing at home, Amei and Zhang Han should be safe.

Yet unease lingered. He called Xue Jing. “Jingjing, has anything happened at home?”

“No, except Hanhan’s been crying and throwing tantrums, demanding you take her out to play. She’s been bouncing around the house like a monkey,” Xue Jing replied calmly.

Relieved, Guanyu set aside his worries. With no trace of Jinhua, he turned back.

He decided to visit the Night Blossom Club, hoping Hou Jinshun might have leads. Arriving at noon when few patrons lingered, Hou Jinshun had a server bring nuts as they sat down to talk.

“Any news on Jinhua?” Guanyu asked.

Hou Jinshun shook his head. “She’s deliberately hiding. With China’s vast population, finding someone like her—who’s far from ordinary and skilled at concealment—is no easy task.”

Guanyu agreed. The morning’s cryptic note baffled him—perhaps merely a prank. Jinhua likely wouldn’t risk meeting him easily, assuming the Yang family’s son-in-law would side with them. Appearing openly might alert the Yangs.

Still empty-handed after the wild goose chase, Guanyu left the club and headed home.

En route, Lü Mei suddenly called. “Guanyu, come quick! My stomach… it hurts terribly. I don’t know why!”

Lü Mei had been in class when Uncle Wang delivered lunch. Before eating, agonizing pain struck. “Stay calm. I’m on my way,” Guanyu reassured, flooring the accelerator. At school, Wei Hongwei and Uncle Wang hovered helplessly as Lü Mei, refusing to be moved, insisted on waiting for her man.

Ignoring security guards’ glares, Guanyu honked through the crowded noon streets and parked beneath the teaching building. Rushing to the classroom, he encountered Wang Jun. “Guanyu! I need to—”

“Later!” he cut her off. Pan Xiaxia arrived simultaneously, having rushed over upon hearing the news.

In the classroom, Lü Mei lay pale-lipped and drenched in cold sweat. Without hesitation, Guanyu scooped her up and ran out. “Why wasn’t she taken to the hospital earlier?!” he demanded.

“She refused until you came,” Uncle Wang apologized.

Guanyu cradled Lü Mei tenderly. “This is my fault.” Driving one-handed, he grasped her wrist to check her meridians—and froze.

She might be pregnant. The revelation struck like lightning. Yet only a medical confirmation could be certain.

At the hospital, blood stained Lü Mei’s black skirt. “Doctors! Where are the doctors?!” Guanyu shouted. Staff rushed her into surgery. Guanyu, Uncle Wang, and Wei Hongwei anxiously waited outside. Guanyu vowed never to forgive himself if this caused lasting harm.

Five minutes later, the surgeon emerged. “What’s wrong with her?!” Guanyu pressed.

“Next time she has cramps, just take painkillers at home,” the doctor chuckled. “She’s perfectly healthy.”

“But the pain and bleeding?!” Guanyu persisted.

“Merely her menstrual cycle. No need for hysterics.” The doctor walked off, leaving them dumbfounded.

Menstruation?! The absurdity dawned on them. Lü Mei, now medicated, still winced but managed a weak smile. Though Guanyu suggested hospital rest, she insisted on returning home.

“I’m sorry, Guanyu,” Lü Mei murmured in the car. “I’ve never had cramps before.”

“Life changes might’ve caused this. I’ll help regulate your qi later,” he promised, planning acupoint therapy.

Despite the false alarm, Guanyu urged her to rest, but Lü Mei—ever the diligent student—insisted on returning to class. Sun Xu’s continued absence spoke volumes; the coward hid from retribution.

Bored on campus, Guanyu learned Wei Yong had joined the Yu Gang, seeking mentorship. Confronted by Wei Yong outside the building, Guanyu demurred: “I’m not qualified to teach yet, but there will be time.”

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei’s attempt to disband the Gentleman’s Hall backfired when Xiao Gen—Sun Xu’s new lieutenant—countered rumors. A botched ambush in the woods left Wei Hongwei’s forces outnumbered until Wei Yong’s intervention enabled their escape.

Later, Sun Xu—plotting in a luxury hotel with Bai Jiao—considered kidnapping one of Guanyu’s lovers. “Let’s take Lan Yu,” he decided, malice curling his lips.
