“Huff…”

Jingang abruptly appeared in mid-air, his black staff resembling a pillar supporting the heavens as it viciously crushed down toward Xuan Feizi. In an instant, the spiritual energy in the air seemed to freeze.

“How dare you—”

“You dare strike, you thief?!”

……

The Kunlun disciples erupted in curses, but their shouts proved futile. They were all swept aside by the oppressive force of the descending staff—even those at the Tribulation Transcendence stage. Only Xuan Feizi remained standing at the center of the plaza, his face ashen as he glared at the black staff plummeting from the sky.

“You go too far…” A flicker of light flashed in Xuan Feizi’s hand, revealing a small apricot-yellow banner. With a gentle shake, a myriad of auspicious lights, thousands of auspicious auras, and golden lotuses blooming in abundance erupted. The downward momentum of the black staff halted abruptly, even showing signs of rebounding.

“Too far? Hahaha… This world belongs to the strong. Today, I am stronger—so even if I trample you, what can you do? If that were the true Apricot Yellow Banner, I’d admit defeat. But this counterfeit? Break!” Jingang laughed wildly. His staff trembled thrice in an eerie rhythm before accelerating violently, colliding with the golden lotuses.

*Boom!*

Black and golden lights clashed like meteors. Surging primal energies collided in the air, obscuring both figures in a dazzling storm of energy.

Everyone present stared intently at the swirling chaos. Who would prevail?

*Thud!*

A figure shot out awkwardly, stumbling several steps after landing—Xuan Feizi. As the energy dispersed, a massive trench carved by Jingang’s staff scarred the Kunlun plaza. Jingang stood tall, staff in hand, his calm gaze silencing all who dared meet his eyes.

“Old man,” Jingang declared arrogantly, “hear this: if Ye Qingling isn’t here within five minutes, I will bathe Kunlun in blood. Let’s see who can stop me!” His domineering aura felt justified—even the Kunlun Grand Elder wielding an immortal artifact had fallen to a single strike. Who could oppose him?

“Hah… Very well. Sect Leader, this matter rests on your decision. After all, she is your daughter.” Xuan Feizi exhaled deeply. For a moment, he had sensed death’s breath—that black staff was undoubtedly an immortal artifact of destruction.

“I have no objections. I never agreed to this marriage—it was the Grand Elder’s insistence. Sect Leader Guan, wait a moment. I’ll fetch Qingling.” Ye Xinwu’s calm words left the crowd stunned. The Kunlun Sect Leader had no shame!

“Ye Xinwu, you—” Hai Wubo’s face paled. Standing beside Xuan Feizi, he trembled with fury, yet knew the tide had turned. With his master defeated, what could he do?

“Guan Yu! If you think to steal my wife from Kunlun, you’ll have to tread over my corpse!” Hai Wubo, groomed by Xuan Feizi’s faction to contend for leadership, mustered his courage. If Ye Qingling were taken, he’d become a laughingstock.

“Brother Guan Yu, you’ve finally come for me?” Ye Qingling gazed at Guan Yu, tears of joy streaming. Three years had matured the young girl.

“Qingling, I—*Watch out!*” Guan Yu’s relaxed expression vanished as Hai Wubo vanished, reappearing behind Ye Qingling with murderous intent.

“Hmph. How dare you lay hands on our future sect mistress?” Qin Wuliang’s expression hardened. With a flick of his finger, the Dragon-Tiger Scepter transformed into a binding light, hoisting Hai Wubo mid-air. Purple lightning crackled along the bonds, eliciting agonized screams.

“A minor lesson. Don’t worry—I’ll spare his life. Kunlun’s discipline sorely needs improvement.” Qin Wuliang’s tone dripped disdain.

“Qingling, I’m sorry I’m late. Come with me. From today, no one will ever harm you.” Guan Yu flashed to the stunned girl, embracing her gently. His eyes brimmed with tenderness, guilt, and resignation—after this upheaval, returning to Kunlun would be impossible.

“It’s alright. I understand… You had your reasons. But you came, didn’t you?” Resting her head against his chest, Ye Qingling radiated bliss. This long-dreamed moment felt surreal yet undeniable.

Departing with four, returning with five, they secluded themselves at the mountain’s base. Once Jingang and Qin Wuliang were recalled into the sect, Jingang exhaled heavily—his borrowed body had reached its limit.

“Old Qin, the rest is yours. This vessel can only be used within the sect. To fight outside again… I’ll need half a year to nurture it.” Jingang’s voice weakened as silver light streamed from his body into the Fumo Staff, entering dormancy.

**Chapter 2000: Bloodslayer’s Descent**

“We owe you much. Few could shatter the Apricot Yellow Banner with a single strike. Rest well—I’ll handle sect matters.” Qin Wuliang sighed. Jingang enduring until leaving Kunlun surpassed expectations, but the price was steep—six months of recovery for a borrowed form.

“We’ve made bitter enemies today. Jingang, how should Fumo Sect proceed?” While Guan Yu lingered with Ye Qingling, Qin Wuliang contemplated the sect’s future for the first time since awakening.

“This Kunlun venture has pros and cons. But Fumo Sect’s long dormancy ends today—we’ve made our mark. Old Qin, consult the sect leader during my recuperation.” With a golden flash, the Fumo Staff stilled.

“The sect, always the sect…” Qin Wuliang’s expression turned wry. Guan Yu’s potential remained unclear—his Kunlun conduct showed propriety, not brilliance. Closing his eyes, Qin focused on harmonizing with his new body.

Over following months, Guan Yu toured Ye Qingling across the land, earning her admiration with his vast knowledge.

“Brother Guan Yu, how do you know everything?” Ye Qingling gazed at him with starry eyes.

“Books, little fool. This is the Yangtze’s estuary. The boundless sea… I’ve always yearned to explore it. When time allows, let’s sail its vastness.” Guan Yu smiled at the 18-year-old who still resembled a sprite.

“Yes! By then, the sisters should finish seclusion. I’d love to play with them!” Ye Qingling darted along the shore like a butterfly, her laughter enchanting as a lark’s song.

“Sect Leader, beware—something in the sea!” Qin Wuliang’s warning preceded an explosive surge. A blue net ensnared toward Ye Qingling as a monstrous wave crashed toward Guan Yu.

“Qingling, *move!*” Guan Yu’s expression darkened. Dragon and tiger phantoms materialized, their roars freezing the air.

*Boom!*

Guan Yu shattered the watery wall. Ye Qingling, sensing danger, vanished with a flash of purple lightning—Thunder Evasion—reappearing 500 meters ashore.

Beyond the dissipating wave, Guan Yu glimpsed a figure soaring like a roc. Circling once, it dove viciously toward Ye Qingling.

“You dare?!” Purple lightning crackled at Guan Yu’s feet as a dragon-shaped aura lashed out. The attacker halted mid-air, pivoting into a raptor’s dive.

“Fine! Let’s see if your talons outmatch my fists—*Dragon Soaring the Heavens!*” Guan Yu unleashed the Dragon Subduing Palm, golden dragon aura clashing 78 times mid-air before a final collision sent both combatants earthward. Ye Qingling had already retreated to Guan Yu’s side; the blue net retracted.

“Ren Xuesha of Tianpeng Sect?” Guan Yu tensed. The final exchange revealed his opponent’s superior cultivation—Golden Core late-stage versus mid-stage.

“Heh. Worthy of Wild Crane’s disciple. But survive this? Next time? Guan Yu, face me alone—unless you want bystanders hurt.” Ren Xuesha—Ren Qiansha’s brother, Tianpeng Sect’s inner disciple—was infamous for brutality.

“Truly shameless. If you discard honor, so shall I. If I win, the Ren Clan faces my wrath.” Guan Yu coldly stored Ye Qingling in the sect realm, steeling himself. A mid-stage Golden Core challenging a late-stage—with superior artifacts—was perilous.

“Hah! You think you’ll live to try?” The blue net surged, reeking of brine—a Golden Core-grade artifact.

Guan Yu flicked a yellow orb—earth essence condensed. Activating Gravity Domain, the net faltered.

“Child’s play. Anything else? If not…” Guan Yu smirked. Though the orb lacked grade, elemental suppression—earth over water—worked flawlessly, per Qin Wuliang’s guidance.

**Chapter 2001: Transcending Stages**

“A mid-stage Golden Core, so arrogant? Witness the gap between stages!” Ren Xuesha sneered, a roc phantom materializing behind him.

“*Divine Ability: Roc Spreads Wings!*”

Ren Xuesha vanished, the phantom solidifying.

*Screech!*

The roc appeared above Guan Yu, talons and golden feathers slashing. Twin golden beams shot from its eyes.

“Hmph. Divine Abilities? I have those too! *Dragon’s Roar and Tiger’s Howl!*” Guan Yu vanished, replaced by a white tiger whose sonic roar rippled visibly.

The roc faltered, destabilized.

*Roar!*

A golden dragon entangled the roc, its form fading to reveal Ren Xuesha’s battered body.

*Boom!*

Dragon and tiger struck simultaneously. Ren Xuesha crossed arms, vomiting blood as he hurtled backward.

“Impossible! Divine Abilities require late-stage Golden Core! How?!”

“Possible for me. If I couldn’t surpass you, how would I be called a genius? Die, Ren Xuesha!”

Purple light flashed. Guan Yu vanished, a violet sword materializing.

“*Divine Ability: Northern Dipper—Celestial Pivot!*”

The blade passed. A head rolled. Guan Yu stood behind, holding the severed head.

“Pity. Weak resolve. A proper challenge would’ve honed you, Sect Leader.” Qin Wuliang’s voice echoed regretfully.

“Easy? I’m spent! Without the true Fumo Heart Sutra, two Divine Abilities would’ve killed me!” Guan Yu trembled, unaware his feat—transcending stages—would soon resound across the cultivation world.

That night, within the sect, Guan Yu stared dumbfounded as Qin Wuliang demonstrated over a hundred ways to annihilate Ren Xuesha using only *Dragon’s Roar and Tiger’s Howl*.

“This defies reason…” Guan Yu groaned. Though his replication talent mimicked forms, mastery required practice.

“These are but my experiences. Techniques are dead—innovation breathes life. This basic Fumo Sect skill, when mastered, has slain those a major realm higher. As sect leader, you must excel.” Qin Wuliang departed, leaving Guan Yu to train.

“Slaying a realm above…” Excitement kindled. His connection to Fumo Sect deepened—what secrets might its foundations hold?
