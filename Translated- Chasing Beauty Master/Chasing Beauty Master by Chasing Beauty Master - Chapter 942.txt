Guan Yu now saw three individuals, each positioned at different vantage points, all stationed on the flanks. Likely fearing another sudden emergence of golden energy spheres within the house, they kept a cautious distance.

After scrutinizing the area, Guan Yu detected no others. The buildings across the street were residential—unlikely hiding spots for snipers.

Yet given the circumstances, it seemed only five adversaries had arrived today? Something felt amiss. Whether targeting Second to Wolf or himself, the opposing force surely exceeded this number.

“There must be hidden operatives lying in wait,” Guan Yu concluded silently. Closer observation was imperative. Just then, two figures approached cautiously from the west.

Second to Wolf, ever shrewd, strode forward to intercept them. “Halt! Identify yourselves!” he barked.

Startled, the duo immediately aimed their pistols at him. Second to Wolf dropped into a crouch, hands raised in supplication. “Mercy, sirs! This is my first time stealing—spare me!” he pleaded in flawless Japanese.

Guan Yu initially worried Second to Wolf might be recognized. But the moment the pair turned, his companion had already ducked his head, trembling convincingly.

The two assailants—a man and a woman—glared down. “Scram if you value your life,” the woman snapped in accented English.

Guan Yu frowned. Despite their Eastern features, they spoke English—likely to obscure their identities. As Second to Wolf cowered, the pair edged closer, guns trained on him.

After scanning their surroundings, the woman ordered, “Look up,” her tone icy and precise.

“Y-yes, ma’am! Please don’t shoot! Damn your grandmother—” Mid-plea, Second to Wolf exploded into motion.

His hands shot out, seizing their wrists with surgical precision. A twist disarmed them. Yanking the pair forward, he released their wrists and struck their throats in one fluid motion.

The duo collapsed without a sound, necks snapped. Watching from afar, Guan Yu marveled at the lethal elegance—true to a First-Class尊者 (Supreme Adept).

Retrieving the fallen pistols, Second to Wolf turned to toss one to Guan Yu, only to find him already behind him.

“Hell! When did you climb down?” Second to Wolf grumbled, unsettled by Guan Yu’s undetectable movements despite his own heightened senses.

“Just now,” Guan Yu replied, accepting the weapon. “From the tree, I spotted two on the left, one on the right, all aiming at the house. Unknown if more lurk elsewhere.”

**Chapter 2409: You Don’t Understand Me**

“Of course there’s more. This isn’t child’s play,” Second to Wolf countered. “Our priority is diverting attention so Sakurako can evacuate Lanyu and A’cai through the hidden exit. Lingering inside risks bombardment—grenades or worse.”

Guan Yu nodded. “We’ll split up—you take the right, I’ll handle the left. The gunfire will signal Sakurako to move.”

“No. I’ll draw fire alone. You escort them out,” Second to Wolf insisted.

“Unacceptable. I won’t let you face this alone,” Guan Yu refused.

Second to Wolf smirked. “Risk? These ants pose no threat. Stick to the plan.”

“I said no,” Guan Yu stood firm. “They’ve studied your capabilities. They’ll come prepared. Snipers, reinforcements—it’s suicide alone.”

Second to Wolf’s eyes narrowed. “Since when do you doubt me? Or has your spine turned to jelly?”

Guan Yu ignored the jab. “Dividing their focus halves the danger. Every second we argue endangers Sakurako.”

Relenting, Second to Wolf nodded. “Fine. But mask up—delay their identification.”

Tearing cloth from their garments, they veiled their faces and split.

Guan Yu burst forth, a blur of motion trailing afterimages. His pistol barked thrice—wild shots amid his serpentine sprint. Enemy gunfire erupted from opposite buildings, but his erratic path defied targeting.

Meanwhile, Second to Wolf lunged into the fray, cleaving a boulder with his blade and hurling it onto a black van. The crushing impact drew half the attackers leftward, easing Guan Yu’s onslaught.

“Full assault! Snipers—engage on sight!” an unseen commander roared.

Bullets rained as adversaries swarmed from flanking structures, armed with assault rifles. Guan Yu’s shield shimmered, deflecting rounds that would have shredded flesh.

**Chapter 2410: Without Hesitation**

Inside, Sakurako heard the gunfire. “Crawl to the bathroom—quickly!” she instructed.

Lanyu and A’cai followed, bellies to the floor. Reaching the lavish bathroom—more lounge than utilitarian space—Lanyu gaped. “This is a *bathroom*?”

“Later!” Sakurako hissed, triggering a hidden door. “We flee—now!”

“But Guan Yu—” Lanyu protested.

“He’ll find us once we’re clear. Staying makes us liabilities,” Sakurako argued.

A’cai added, “The gunfight intensifies. Our escape buys their retreat.”

Reluctantly, Lanyu agreed. They emerged into a copse, reaching a riverbank.

“I can’t swim,” A’cai admitted shamefully.

Sakurako assessed a poplar. “A’cai—split this!”

Channeling training from Second to Wolf, A’cai shattered the trunk. They launched a buoyant section into the water.

“Hold this,” Sakurako directed. “We’ll push you across.”

**Chapter 2411: Escape (Part 1)**

Clutching the log, A’cai waded into deeper currents as the women guided him. Lanyu, though slight, powered through with practiced strokes.

Behind them, gunfire crescendoed—a desperate symphony urging their flight.
