“Hmm? What did you say? Have the guts to repeat that?” Wen Baoguo's eyes narrowed sharply as he glared coldly, snorting furiously!

Chapter 889: Grandpa Isn't Sick - You're the One Who's Ill

When forcefulness is needed, one must persist in being forceful. Otherwise, maintaining constant humility would only create an impression of weakness and incompetence.

Especially when facing people like Wen Baoguo who have long held high positions or belong to powerful family clans, Guan Yu had accumulated considerable experience!

The key lies in demonstrating capabilities that make them take notice or possessing bargaining chips that stir their interest.

Put bluntly, it's about the food chain of interests. As long as they can gain existing or greater benefits from this chain, they have no reason to reject its existence - they'd even gladly accept it.

This was fully demonstrated in handling Mo Ling's situation.

Guan Yu also believed Wen Baoguo would eventually accept him. Showing some forcefulness now would make future interactions with his father-in-law easier.

Look how far ahead Guan Yu was thinking!

Ignoring Wen Baoguo's rage, Guan Yu smiled calmly: "Though others can't save Grandpa's critical condition, it doesn't mean he's reached his twilight beyond salvation!"

Wen Baoguo raised his eyebrows. "So you have a solution?"

Guan Yu straightened proudly with confident nod.

His confidence came from the healing system - the miraculous energy from that bronze coin could cure any illness. Even a dying man clinging to life could be revived through Guan Yu's miraculous power.

However, others saw this confidence as arrogant presumption. Wen Baoguo sneered: "Big talker! Aren't you afraid your lies will choke you?"

Wen Qing protested: "Dad, let him examine Grandpa and you'll see!"

"I won't risk Grandpa's life with some untrustworthy quack!" Wen Baoguo said sternly.

"Dad, Guan Yu's my husband!" Wen Qing retorted.

"You think I don't know his promiscuous life? Calling him husband - have you no shame? We still want face!" Wen Baoguo roared angrily.

The argument escalated until Guan Yu intervened: "Uncle Wen, besides trusting me, do you have other options? If others could help, Grandpa wouldn't be like this! Without Grandpa's influence, your future path won't be smooth!"

Wen Baogoo's expression stiffened - Guan Yu's analysis struck true. His political future depended on his father's influence.

"This isn't your concern!" Wen Baoguo said coldly.

"But it's your problem!" Guan Yu countered seriously. "Moreover...Grandpa isn't sick. You're the one who's ill!"

This bombshell stunned everyone. Wen Baoguo roared: "What did you say?!"

"I said - you're ill, while Grandpa's perfectly healthy!" Guan Yu reiterated.

Using his investigative system, Guan Yu had discovered Wen Shiquan was feigning illness while Wen Baoguo harbored serious health issues.

Chapter 890: Do You Have Any Other Objections?

After exposing Wen Shiquan's pretense, the old man suddenly sat up laughing: "Good! Good grandson-in-law! How did you see through my act?"

Guan Yu smiled: "As your doctor and grandson-in-law who saved your life before, noticing your act was natural."

Wen Shiquan praised Guan Yu while berating his son: "You couldn't even recognize my pretense! I support Guan Yu and Qing'er completely! Do you have any other objections?"

Chapter 891: A Private Word

After resolving the confrontation, Wen Shiquan privately told Guan Yu: "My pretense aimed to test you and bring Qing'er home. You passed admirably!"

The family was astonished by Wen Shiquan's sudden recovery and full endorsement of Guan Yu. Despite Wen Baoguo's protests, the patriarch's authority prevailed.
