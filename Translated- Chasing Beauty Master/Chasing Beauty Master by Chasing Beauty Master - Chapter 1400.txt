“Especially Guan Yu, who was new to the sect—his sword-riding skills were still somewhat unpolished. Thus, Xuan Ming had already arranged for two fine horses to await them at the foot of Yunqing Mountain. The two hung their packs on the saddles and began their journey.

They reached a town in less than half a day. Yan Zhao declared loudly, “Let’s rest here before continuing, shall we?”

In truth, Yan Zhao had received orders from the Demon Soul Sect to stop here—all part of Wang Xiaorong’s arrangements. Guan Yu, coincidentally thinking the same, recognized this as the town Wang Xiaorong had mentioned and nodded.

The town, neither large nor small, was called Northridge. Wang Xiaorong, accompanied by several Demon Soul Sect members, awaited Guan Yu’s arrival there.

The pair entered an inn, where a waiter hurried over with a smile. “Honored guests, please ascend to the private chamber upstairs. Your meal will be served shortly. Please wait a moment.”

Guan Yu grew suspicious. The waiter’s tone suggested this was Wang Xiaorong’s doing—they had anticipated his arrival, even preparing food in advance. Yet he worried such obvious arrangements might alert Yan Zhao.

Upon reaching the upper floor, Yan Zhao said, “Guan Yu, wait here. I’ll scout outside. Start eating without me.”

“Where shall we regroup afterward?” Guan Yu asked.

“Tomorrow morning, right here. We’ll rest tonight and continue then.” With that, Yan Zhao left.

Guan Yu found it peculiar. *Is he deliberately giving me time alone? Could he have noticed something?*

Unbeknownst to him, this was Wang Xiaorong’s command. Upon arriving, she had secretly instructed Yan Zhao to separate from Guan Yu and report to the Demon Soul Sect’s branch. Her sole aim was to isolate Yan Zhao.

As Guan Yu waited, servers streamed into the room bearing dishes and wine jars. The last attendant announced, “Your feast is complete, sir. Enjoy at your leisure. Summon us for anything.”

Left alone with the lavish spread, Guan Yu decided to eat rather than let it go to waste. Just as he lifted his chopsticks, the door swung open to reveal Wang Xiaorong, smiling brightly. “You’ve finally come! I’ve waited days! Xuan Ming truly dawdles—how long does it take to send you out after all my planning?”

Guan Yu startled. “How dare you come so openly? Yan Zhao might still be nearby!”

Wang Xiaorong laughed. “Worry not. Your esteemed senior brother Yan Zhao is actually one of *our* Yunqing Sect members.”

“Impossible!” Guan Yu stared, incredulous. *Does the Demon Soul Sect infiltrate everyone? Will Yunqing Sect survive this?*

“Nothing’s impossible for the Demon Soul Sect,” she replied, gliding inside. “Why else would Yan Zhao leave? ‘Scouting’? Ridiculous! I sent him away so we could meet.”

“Yan Zhao serves *your* sect? But he’s Xuan Ming’s star disciple! No wonder Yunqing’s secrets never stay hidden.” The revelation shook Guan Yu, though it explained Yan Zhao’s uncharacteristic restraint.

Now he understood Wang Jun’s earlier assurance—with even Yan Zhao compromised, their plans were indeed foolproof.

Closing the door, Wang Xiaorong sat across from him. “Let’s dine while we talk. How do you find my selection?”

“Edible. I’m not picky.” Guan Yu began eating. “I hear the Demon Lord wishes to see me?”

“Yes. When I told Father about us, he insisted on meeting you.”

“You *told* him? I explicitly said to keep this secret!”

Wang Xiaorong flinched at his anger. “I had no choice! Father was sending assassins. Only by confessing could I protect you!”

Guan Yu believed her sincerity. “Why target me? For the Eight-Sided Drum artifact?”

“Naturally! You obtained its first fragment from Elder Menghua’s tomb. Without our relationship, you’d already be dead.” She leaned forward. “But there’s more—Father plans to use the drum to resurrect the Heavenly Ape, a primordial beast. Its revival would bring cataclysm.”

Guan Yu froze. “Resurrecting that monstrosity? Are you certain?”

“According to Elder Jiu, yes.”

Horror paled Wang Xiaorong’s face. She knew the legends—the Heavenly Ape’s return would drown the world in blood.

“Then why meet me?” Guan Yu pressed. “To claim the drum fragment? I’ll never surrender it.”

“He won’t harm you now. My protection ensures that.”

“Where?”

“You’re honored—Father came personally, a first! But fitting for his future son-in-law.” Her proud smile faltered at Guan Yu’s frown. “There are conditions for our desert journey to Miao City.”

“Name them.”

“First, alter your appearance. Beauty invites trouble.”

She preened at the compliment. “Done.”

“Second, conceal your identity. No Demon Soul guards—I’ll protect you. Their presence risks exposure.”

“Father may object, but I’ll try.”

“Third, maintain Yan Zhao’s cover. He remains merely Yunqing’s senior brother to me.”

“Easily done.” She nodded eagerly. “Once Father agrees to withdraw guards, all terms are met?”

“Yes. I’ll address it during our meeting. Overshadowing protection often backfires.”

**Chapter 3,633: No Favors Granted**

After dining, Wang Xiaorong explained Yan Zhao’s defection: “The Blood Lord of Black Blood Ridge poisoned his subordinates, including Yan Zhao during his infiltration. After we destroyed that sect, Yan Zhao’s antidote came from us. Survival required his loyalty.”

Guan Yu connected the dots. “So the Left Peak Forest murders…?”

“His poison flare-up, yes. Keep this secret.”

“My loyalty lies with neither side,” Guan Yu vowed. “But while posing as Yunqing’s disciple, I must play their game.”

Wang Xiaorong’s gaze softened. “I understand. Yet I wish to know you better—your past, your true aims…”

“That stays buried.” His tone brooked no argument. “Regarding the Demon Lord—if he attacks, I’ll retaliate. Warn him.”

She marveled at his audacity. Though no match for her father, Guan Yu’s unshakable confidence radiated authority. “Should it come to that, I’ll shield you with my life.”

Both knew the stakes. The Eight-Sided Drum’s power could unleash apocalypse. Yet Wang Xiaorong resolved to oppose even her father should he pursue this madness.

“Meet him now,” she urged. “He’s waited hours, respecting your need to rest.”

Guan Yu stood, steeling himself. “Lead on.”

Giggling, she clasped his arm. “Time for the awkward suitor to meet his father-in-law!”
