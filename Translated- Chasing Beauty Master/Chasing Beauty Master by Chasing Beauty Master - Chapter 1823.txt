“You lot only know how to spout pleasantries,” said an elderly man standing to the side. His weathered appearance spoke of vast experience and years accumulated.

“Back when Dai Xiaotian (Enlightened Heaven) was the Martial Alliance Leader,” the old man continued, “his beloved was captured. He sought to rally the martial world to rescue her, yet not a single comrade would join him. Going alone against the demonic realm’s creatures? Surviving would’ve been a miracle.”

Guanyu’s curiosity stirred. “Such a tale! As Alliance Leader, Dai Xiaotian must’ve had authority and sworn brothers. Why did none aid him?”

“The demonic hordes were overwhelming in both power and numbers. Their target was the East Sea Dragon Pearl. Who’d follow him to certain death?”

Guanyu nodded. Facing inevitable doom, none would volunteer. Yet Dai Xiaotian’s desperate bid for his beloved compelled admiration.

“In truth,” the elder explained, “Dai Xiaotian never truly demanded others join him. He knew any companions would perish needlessly. That night, he gathered his closest friends. While they feared he’d ask them to join his suicidal mission, he instead drugged their wine.”

“When they awoke,” the storyteller’s voice thickened, “they found him gone. His final words lingered: ‘To save my love, my death suffices.’ He faced the demonic horde alone.”

“Later accounts say he slaughtered countless demons, nearly rescuing Lady Qiao. Yet ultimately, he fell to their traps, dying without escaping with his beloved.”

Hearing this fragmented history, Guanyu grasped Dai Xiaotian’s essence—a true hero sacrificing himself despite hopeless odds. Such courage deserved reverence.

“Though Dai Xiaotian perished,” another voice interjected, “Lady Qiao’s fate remains unclear. His last stand crippled the demonic forces, driving them back to their realm.”

“A heroic tale I’d never heard!” Guanyu exclaimed. “This Dragon Pearl carries such tragedy. Yet the ending... unsatisfying.”

“His bravery bought humanity peace,” Guanyu mused. “Expelling the demons makes him a savior.”

The old man sighed. “People remember curses, not blessings. Some call Dai Xiaotian foolishly lovesick. Others blame Lady Qiao’s Pearl for attracting demons. None credit his sacrifice. Heroes fade; scandals endure.”

“Truth in that,” Guanyu conceded. “Good deeds vanish like morning dew while wickedness stains history’s fabric.”

Contemplating the luminous pearl in his hand—retrieved from Swordless Manor’s vaults—Guanyu marveled. This artifact’s tragic legacy now enhanced its mystique. Murmurs around him shifted from admiration to avarice as treasure rumors surfaced.

“They say the Pearl hides secrets of East Sea riches,” a bystander whispered. “Enough to rival kingdoms!”

Guanyu tensed. The crowd’s gaze turned predatory. Whether this orb truly held power mattered less than their sudden hunger. He needed to act.

“Venerable elder,” an onlooker pressed, “how came you by this Pearl?”

Guanyu improvised: “Found in a sunlit cavern, its radiance marked it special. Only now do I learn its name and legend.” Feigning nonchalance, he added, “Today, I gift this to Lady Jiang.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The Jiang heiress blinked in astonishment, still moved by the tragic romance. To her, the Pearl symbolized undying love far beyond material worth.

“For me?” Her voice quivered. At this impressionable age, such tales of devotion pierced her heart. Even were it mere glass, the story alone would enchant her.

Guanyu bowed, hiding his calculations. While treasure rumors intrigued him, survival outweighed greed. Possessing this notorious artifact invited endless peril. Let nobility shield it now.

“Beauty deserves splendor,” he declared. “Only your grace could honor this Pearl’s legacy.” His flattery danced expertly between sincerity and strategy.

Lady Jiang flushed, disarmed by praise that usually repelled her. Nearby, her suitor Chu Fan glowered, suspicion and jealousy warring in his gaze.

“This reeks of deception!” Chu Fan interjected. “None parts with such treasure without motive!”

Guanyu met his glare. “Not all measure worth by your petty standards. I seek only the Black Gemstone in exchange.”

The heiress waved aside objections. “Done! The gemstone’s yours.” She cradled the Pearl like a newborn, already enthralled.

As Guanyu accepted her promise, relief mingled with unexpected regret. He’d meant this jewel for his beloved Xiaorong, yet survival dictated otherwise. The Black Gemstone’s mystical potential outweighed sentimental attachments.

“Your generosity humbles me,” he thanked Lady Jiang, ignoring Chu Fan’s murderous glare. With the crowd’s greed now redirected toward nobility, Guanyu could finally breathe.

Yet as he withdrew, the heiress’s voice halted him: “Your name, stranger? I’d know who brings such gifts... and stories.”

Her directness charmed him. “Guanyu, my lady. A wanderer fortunate enough to cross your path.”

He departed amidst buzzing speculation, the Dragon Pearl’s legacy continuing its unpredictable journey. Somewhere, Dai Xiaotian’s ghost might smile—his sacrifice, though forgotten by history, had kindled new fires in living hearts.
