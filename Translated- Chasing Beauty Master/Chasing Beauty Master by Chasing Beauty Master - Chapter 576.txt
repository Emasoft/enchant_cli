Guan Yu shook his head and said, “What’s there to handle? I’m not that wicked. Besides, I actually quite like these young folks. At least they’re vibrant and energetic, unlike your dreary self who only knows how to flatter!”

Harris flushed with embarrassment at Guan Yu’s words and quickly changed the subject. “Haha, Young Master Guan Yu jests. Ahem... Is everyone’s clothing dry? Let us depart!”

Without waiting for consensus, Harris strode forward ahead of the group.

Guan Yu chuckled. He deemed Harris’s type negligible—as long as the man didn’t provoke him, he wouldn’t interfere regardless of what was said or done.

After another hour of trekking, Guan Yu finally glimpsed a towering mountain ahead. Murphy pointed and said, “Brother Guan Yu, the Huntian Sect lies just beyond that peak. Are you certain you wish to enter with us?”

Guan Yu nodded. He sensed deeper implications in Murphy’s words but saw no alternative. Moreover, he trusted his own strength. The Huntian Sect couldn’t be too formidable—otherwise, Harris, as their Black Deacon, would have displayed greater prowess.

“Since I promised to accompany you, I won’t go back on my word. Didn’t I also vow to teach you magic?”

“But earlier you said...”

“That was just to scare you! Did you truly believe it? Fear not—though I’m no heroic paragon of integrity, I honor commitments within my power.”

Murphy’s heart swelled with joy upon hearing Guan Yu reaffirm his promise. He quickened his pace, leading the group toward the mountain gate.

When they reached the base, an enormous stone wall loomed before them. Guan Yu marveled at the divine craftsmanship. “This could be a tourist attraction in another world! Pity it’s merely used as a cave here.”

As Guan Yu stood transfixed, a dark shadow flashed before his eyes. Four or five figures materialized before them.

“Halt!”

Guan Yu observed the speaker—a black-clad man with an icy demeanor radiating aloof authority.

“Greetings, Captain,” Harris addressed the guard. “We’re the hunting party that departed yesterday. Due to unforeseen delays, we stayed overnight outside. We request passage.”

“Oh?” The guard scrutinized them, his gaze settling on Guan Yu. “Who’s this? He’s no disciple of our Huntian Sect.”

“Your discernment is keen, Captain. Indeed, he isn’t—but he’s our friend!”

“Friend? On what grounds? With our sect’s ongoing feud against the Blackwind Sect, how do we know he’s not their spy?”

Unfazed, Harris thumped his chest. “Though I don’t know Young Master Guan Yu’s origins, I guarantee he’s no Blackwind agent. Besides, they couldn’t recruit someone of his caliber!”

“You guarantee?” The guard sneered. “With what credibility? You returned empty-handed after a day and brought this stranger here. What’s your game?”

“I—I have no ulterior motives! Heaven knows my loyalty to the Huntian Sect is absolute!”

“Loyalty isn’t self-proclaimed. If I report your recent... activities to the Sect Master, you’ll be lucky to escape flaying!”

“You vile cur! This grudge stems from me besting you for the Black Deacon position last year! Petty worms like you deserve punishment. Continue this narrow-minded spite, and greater retribution awaits!”

“You dare curse me?” The guard named Nackle swung his blade at Harris’s head—only for the weapon to freeze mid-air.

The two had been rivals since Nackle lost the Black Deacon position to Harris. Though tensions simmered, open conflict had been avoided—until now.

When the suspended blade didn’t fall, Harris glanced past Nackle to Guan Yu, realizing the intervention’s source.

“Strike! Why hesitate?” Harris taunted, noticing the energy currents around the immobilized blade—proof of power beyond Nackle’s capacity.

Guan Yu remarked coolly, “Don’t mistake limited experience for prowess. The world teems with masters you’ve never encountered.”

Another guard approached Guan Yu. “So you’re a peerless expert?”

“Peerless? No. But ‘master’ suits me well.”

The guard’s hollow laughter ceased abruptly. “Such arrogance! Let’s test your claims!”

He attacked—a pitiful display to Guan Yu, who sidestepped and flicked a countermove. Though gentle, the strike sent the guard sprawling.

Trembling, the guard wiped sweat from his brow. “Young Hero, forgive my ignorance!”

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “You were doing your duty. Know this—I’m no spy.”

“Of course! Of course!” The guard stammered as Harris led Guan Yu through the gates.

Inside, Guan Yu gaped at the vista—endless wheat fields bordered by fruit trees, a vibrant utopia defying his expectations of a grim stronghold.

“How...?” Guan Yu murmured.

Murphy asked anxiously, “Do you dislike it here?”

“Like it? I love it!” Guan Yu exclaimed. “This harmonious paradise surpasses all imagination!”

**Chapter 1459: The Peach Blossom Spring**

As they traversed the fields, laborers paused to stare. A silver-clad figure approached—a Silver Guard of the Huntian Sect’s hierarchy:

Bronze (Apprentice Mage)
Silver (Advanced Mage)
Gold (Archmage)
Diamond (Magus)
Sovereign (Grand Magus)

Harris explained, “This is our new friend—a formidable expert our Sect Master will value!”

The Silver Guard probed Guan Yu’s energy, baffled to detect less than 20% elemental essence—a Mid-Level Mage’s baseline. Suspecting deception, he lunged.

Harris intervened, but Guan Yu stopped him. “Let him learn through experience. Some only yield when crushed.”

“You arrogant pup!” The guard drew his sword—only for it to recoil into its sheath under Guan Yu’s aura.

Purple energy erupted, pinning the guard like a puppet. “Still believe I’m weak?” Guan Yu mocked.

Terrified, the guard knelt. “Spare me, Great Hero!”

“Cease the dramatics. Take me to your Sect Master.”

“H-he’s... in secluded cultivation at the forbidden grounds!”

Guan Yu’s aura intensified. “Lying carries consequences.”

“I swear it’s true!” The guard quaked.

**Chapter 1460: The Turncoat**

Suddenly, the Silver Guard collapsed, weeping. “Mercy! I beg you!”

Murphy’s group stared, astonished by the tough guard’s breakdown.

Guan Yu sneered. “Pathetic. Your posturing fools none. Now lead me.”

“B-but the Sect Master truly isn’t...”

“Enough!” Guan Yu’s energy spiked, crushing the guard further. “Shall I demonstrate again?”

Harris urgently whispered, “Young Master, consider the repercussions!”

As tensions peaked, the guard’s resolve shattered completely—a hollow shell of bravado exposed.
