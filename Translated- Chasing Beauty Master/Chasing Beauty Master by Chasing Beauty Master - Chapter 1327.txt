“Aze remarked, ‘But that Young Master Men today was truly taken for a ride by Guanyu. You’re really something, Guanyu—even the City Lord’s second son fell for your tricks!’

‘Enough joking,’ Xiaozhi interjected as he hurried over. ‘I barely ate anything back at Echo Pavilion to avoid blowing Guanyu’s cover. Guanyu, since you splurged on that courtesan, you won’t mind treating Aze and me to a proper feast now, right?’

‘Are you out of your mind?’ Guanyu groaned. ‘You wasted a whole table of food earlier, and now you want me to treat you again? Fine!’ He relented, hoping to silence their chatter before they gossiped to Siqi. ‘What do you want to eat?’

Xiaozhi’s eyes lit up. ‘Just around the corner is the most famous Huangjiang Roast Duck in Qujiang City! I’ve heard it’s incredible—we have to try it!’

‘No problem,’ Aze said with feigned reluctance. ‘I’m not hungry, but I’ll join you.’

‘Ugh, your fake modesty is infuriating!’ Xiaozhi snapped. ‘If you don’t want to go, stay home and bother your servants for food!’

Aze chuckled, raising his hands in surrender. ‘Come on, Xiaozhi—can’t I play along? You and Guanyu act high-and-mighty all the time!’

‘Oh, *please*, Lord Aze!’ Xiaozhi clasped Aze’s arm dramatically. ‘I beg you—join us! Without you, the meal would taste like ashes!’

‘Enough!’ Guanyu interjected. ‘If you two keep this up, I’m leaving. I can’t stand the theatrics.’

‘See?’ Aze sighed. ‘You’ve annoyed Guanyu.’

Xiaozhi rolled his eyes. ‘Guanyu’s just as sappy with Siqi. I’m only following his lead.’

‘But seriously,’ Xiaozhi added, ‘Huangjiang Roast Duck is legendary—people travel across the jianghu just to taste it. My uncle even has shares in the place!’

‘That famous?’ Guanyu mused, intrigued. He wondered if it lived up to the hype, recalling how some renowned dishes disappointed. ‘Is it marinated in soybean paste?’

As they turned the corner, a bustling street came into view. Three hundred paces ahead stood a grand pavilion dwarfing Echo Pavilion, its entrance swarming with patrons. A gilded sign above read *Huangjiang Roast Duck*.

‘There it is!’ Xiaozhi pointed. ‘I can already smell it!’

Aze reminisced, ‘Nothing beats the rabbits Guanyu roasted back in Cloudgreen Sect’s woods.’

‘True,’ Guanyu said without humility. ‘The spices here are lacking, though.’

‘Now I’m craving your rabbit again,’ Xiaozhi lamented. ‘But duck will have to do—’

Before he finished, a cloaked swordsman barged into him. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ Xiaozhi shouted, but the man strode onward, leaving a trail of blood droplets.

‘He’s injured,’ Guanyu observed.

‘Move!’ A familiar female voice rang out. Guanyu turned to see Wang Xiaorong, her eyes sparkling. ‘Guanyu! What are you doing here?’

‘Why *wouldn’t* I be here?’ he replied, warmth flickering in his chest despite himself.

Aze stepped between them, cold. ‘Demon sect sorceress, keep your distance. We’re orthodox disciples—no business with your kind.’

Wang Xiaorong pouted. ‘I’m here for Guanyu, not you. Out of my way!’

‘We should keep to our own waters,’ Aze warned.

Ignoring him, she asked Guanyu, ‘Did you see a cloaked swordsman? I’m tracking someone.’

Guanyu gestured ahead. ‘He went that way—you’ll lose him if you delay.’

‘Too late now,’ she shrugged. ‘Why not join you for dinner?’

‘We’ve already eaten,’ Aze lied.

Xiaozhi’s heart sank—his roast duck was slipping away.

‘Do I owe you silver? Did I desecrate your ancestors?’ Wang Xiaorong retorted. ‘I’m here for Guanyu, not you. Stop acting like his father!’

‘You—!’ Aze sputtered.

‘*I’m already Guanyu’s woman*,’ she declared, stunning them all. ‘He can’t shake me off.’

Guanyu sighed. ‘Why demean yourself like this?’

‘Let’s eat!’ she chirped, clinging to his arm. ‘I heard you wanted roast duck—my treat!’

Aze and Xiaozhi exchanged uneasy glances. If the sect learned of this, Guanyu would face severe punishment.

The roast duck house teemed with patrons. A waiter guided them to a fourth-floor private room, where Yue Jing suddenly accosted them.

‘Guanyu! Consorting with a demoness?’ Yue Jing accused. ‘You stole my Jade Trigram for her, didn’t you?’

‘Watch your tongue!’ Wang Xiaorong shot back. ‘Who’s the real thief here?’

As tensions flared, Guanyu braced for the storm—one that could upend alliances and ignite the jianghu’s simmering strife.”
