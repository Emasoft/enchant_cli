The tall, lanky man named Gao Shen (High Kidney) held the second-highest position here after Kalasi. However, Kalasi suspected these men weren't directly under Gao Shen's command. After calming herself, she said indifferently, "Let's table this matter for now. We have important business to discuss. Have them wait outside."

Gao Shen felt bewildered. Why would Kalasi suspect him? Why did these strangers claim to be his subordinates? He clearly didn't recognize any of them. "Madam Lasi," he protested with an innocent expression, "I don't know these people. If they are followers from my branch, I truly have no knowledge of this situation."

Kalasi had no intention of wasting time on Guan Yu's group. In her mind, these insolent interlopers who dared anger her deserved death. "Gao Shen," she declared, "considering your past contributions to the organization, I'll let you handle this. Dispose of them and let's continue."

Though surprised by Kalasi's uncharacteristic leniency, Gao Shen recognized this as an opportunity. If he eliminated these strangers quickly, he might escape punishment. Raising his bony arm, he barked at Guan Yu's group, "Why are you still here? Get out before I make you!"

The four remained motionless. Second-to-Wolf itched to strike, his fingers twitching at the sight of Gao Shen's posturing, but he waited for Guan Yu's signal. Guan Yu stood calmly, an amused smile playing on his lips as if this confrontation concerned him not at all. "We came specifically to see you," he addressed Gao Shen. "We have urgent business to discuss. If this isn't the place, let's talk outside. This matter requires immediate resolution."

The room erupted in shocked murmurs. How dare these interlopers show such audacity? An elderly man nearest to Guan Yu rose slowly - a rotund Westerner barely reaching 1.4 meters tall. From Guan Yu's perspective, the man's waist circumference nearly matched his height, creating a comical spherical silhouette. His stubby legs resembled chicken drumsticks as he waddled off his chair.

The dwarf's neck bulged thicker than his face, folds of flesh spilling over his collar. His malicious glare promised violence. Guan Yu turned to Jinhua with mock surprise. "Jinhua, he's shorter than you! First time I've seen an elder shorter than your stature."

Jinhua, though petite by Chinese standards at 1.5 meters, suddenly felt tall compared to this Western dwarf. The absurdity struck her - if the lanky man was "High Kidney," shouldn't this rotund creature be called "Short Bladder"? (The dwarf's actual name, Ai Pangguang, roughly translated to "Short Fatty," proved her intuition uncannily accurate.)

"Get out!" the dwarf bellowed, swinging a meaty fist at Guan Yu with unexpected speed. A glint of steel flashed in his hand. Guan Yu sidestepped smoothly, his counterkick accidentally connecting with the dwarf's face instead of abdomen due to the height difference. The crunch of nasal cartilage echoed as the spherical body crashed into a table edge, blood streaming from ruined nose and cracked skull.

Chaos erupted. Six attendees sprang to their feet, weapons drawn. Kalasi's eyes narrowed as she reassessed the intruders. Her initial assumption of common thieves evaporated when she failed to discern Guan Yu's cultivation level. Scanning the group, her face paled upon sensing Second-to-Wolf's aura - this was no ordinary mercenary, but a First-Class Adept!

"Who are you?" Kalasi demanded, forcing calm into her voice. The atmosphere crackled with tension as underlings awaited her command.

Guan Yu produced a grenade with theatrical flourish. "Let's discuss this civilly. Everyone... weapons on the floor. Now."

As firearms clattered to the ground, Second-to-Wolf smirked. The game had begun.
