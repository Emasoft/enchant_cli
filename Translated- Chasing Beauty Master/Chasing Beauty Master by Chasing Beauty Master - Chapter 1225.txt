Guan Yu simply wanted to deflate the opponent's arrogance. This old woman had clearly lived too long on the mountain, becoming a self-righteous creature who thought herself extraordinary when she was merely a frog at the bottom of a well.

After Guan Yu's words, Siqi grew even more anxious. Her master was already furious enough, yet Guan Yu kept provoking her. This situation was becoming truly dire.

As expected, Dai Qianjie's rage intensified the moment Guan Yu finished speaking. Having lived centuries, she'd never encountered such audacious speech. This was utter lawlessness!

Seeing her master's genuine fury, Siqi had no choice. Gritting her teeth, she secretly released the spell restraining Guan Yu's arms and began dissolving the paralysis spell on his lower body, hoping to let him escape.

But Dai Qianjie detected this immediately. She'd intended to teach this insolent brat a lesson first, never imagining someone would dare undo her spells on him. Her eyes bulged with fury as she roared at Siqi: "Siqi! How dare you collude with him! Today, I shall eliminate you two adulterous rats!"

Madness consumed Dai Qianjie. Her most beloved disciple's betrayal pierced deeper than any blade. Though it pained her, she must cleanse the sect's honor. The penalty for betrayal was singular - death.

As Dai Qianjie moved to strike Siqi, Guan Yu suddenly raised his hand and shouted: "Halt!"

His roar carried an icy edge that dropped the hall's temperature visibly. Guan Yu now exuded formidable authority.

Unfazed, Dai Qianjie resolved to eradicate this Yunqing Sect blight. Her palm shot toward Siqi's head - a strike meant to obliterate decades of cultivation.

Siqi surrendered to fate. With her master's trust gone, she closed her eyes awaiting death.

Guan Yu strained against his bonds. As Dai Qianjie's palm descended halfway, an object suddenly materialized before them.

Dai Qianjie froze. Her eyes locked onto the Blazing Heaven Furnace in Guan Yu's hand, then shifted to the Jade Ruyi Scepter in his other grasp.

These weren't common artifacts. The Blazing Heaven Furnace she recognized clearly - Elder Lu had proudly displayed it at Tiger Head Peak. How could such treasures be in this brat's possession? She snatched the furnace for inspection.

Guan Yu then produced Soulfall Blade and Imperial Seal, laying all four artifacts before her.

He'd never intended to reveal these treasures, knowing their allure invited trouble. But desperate times demanded desperate measures.

"Elder Dai," Guan Yu declared, "you recognize these four artifacts. Soulfall Blade and Imperial Seal were gifted by Master Xuanming. Blazing Heaven Furnace and Jade Ruyi came from Uncle Lu. Does this prove my status as Yunqing disciple? Their choice artifacts demonstrate their favor. Think carefully before acting."

Though threatening, Guan Yu's words couldn't mask Dai Qianjie's shock. She verified each artifact, noting the Imperial Seal already bore a master's bond.

Her eyes nearly bulged from their sockets at the treasures. Guan Yu remained calm - these were gifts from Xuanming and Elder Lu. Stealing them would incur their wrath.

"Is...is this truly their gift?" Dai Qianjie stammered incredulously.

"What else? You think I stole from two Elders?" Guan Yu retorted.

These supreme artifacts were practically extensions of their owners' souls. The idea of theft was laughable - the Elders carried them constantly.

Dai Qianjie considered one possibility: "Did you agree to become Xuanming's Guardian? Is that why he gifted these?"

"Enough questions! Contact my Master or Uncle Lu immediately! Delay further and chaos will engulf Front Return Peak!" Guan Yu snapped impatiently.

Chapter 3148: Elevating Status

Dai Qianjie ignored his tone, sweeping all four artifacts into her possession. Guan Yu's heart sank - was this woman planning murder and theft? Yunqing Sect headed the righteous factions! Surely not...

Yet the possibility loomed. Dai Qianjie indeed contemplated killing Guan Yu and silencing witnesses. The Imperial Seal's power tempted her - its reclamation after his death could store four combat spells. But with numerous disciples present, mass slaughter would be required. The thought flickered briefly before extinguishing.

"You...you dare steal these?" Guan Yu accused.

Resuming her seat, Dai Qianje taunted: "Steal? An excellent notion. You think I lack courage?"

"You lack the means," Guan Yu coldly countered. "Kill me, and you must slaughter all witnesses. Become the entire martial world's enemy for trinkets? Worth becoming Yunqing's traitor? Hunted eternally?"

"Clever boy." Dai Qianjie smirked. "I merely safeguard these temporarily." Turning to Siqi: "Contact Elder Lu and Sect Leader immediately. Truth will out."

As Siqi departed, she passed Guan Yu with icy detachment, ignoring his gaze despite their shared ordeal.

Relief washed over Guan Yu. Xuanming's arrival would resolve everything. He prayed Front Return Peak remained stable.

"Your name?" Dai Qianjie demanded.

"Guan Yu."

"Explain this - you claim to be Sect Leader's disciple, yet possess Elder Lu's artifacts. Why gift such treasures to a non-Front Return Peak disciple?"

Tired of this interrogation, Guan Yu dropped his bombshell: "He's my grandfather." Fabricated lineage could elevate status and secure future advantages.

Dai Qianjie's cold lips twitched. "Since when does Elder Lu have such a grandson? His son isn't thirty yet, unmarried. Explain."

"Are you census-taker? I'll remain silent." Guan Yu's patience expired. Rescue neared.

"Such insolence! Is this how your master teaches respect for elders?"

"Junior Sister Dai," boomed Xuanming's voice entering the hall, "did anyone teach you to mistreat my disciple thus?" The Sect Leader arrived with Elder Lu, Siqi trailing silently.

Beside them stood Second-to-Wolf, disheveled from combat. Seeing Guan Yu restrained, the warrior roared: "Who dares harm him? I'll take their head!"

Black-red battle qi erupted, paling the female disciples. Xuanming swiftly dispelled Guan Yu's paralysis.

"Brother Wolf, peace!" Guan Yu urged. "They merely restrained me as precaution."

As the aura receded, Dai Qianjie exhaled shakily. Second-to-Wolf's primal aura had pinned her like prey.

Xuanming addressed Dai Qianjie coldly: "Explain this treatment of my disciple."

Under orders, Siqi recounted events: finding Guan Yu skulking near Juhe Peak, suspecting espionage, the confrontation...

Elder Lu interjected: "Guan Yu! You were supposed to return to Front Return Peak! Did our Juhe Peak sisters' beauty lure you? Your friend here nearly killed me thinking I harmed you!"

Second-to-Wolf bowed apologetically: "My fault, Elder Lu. I acted rashly."

Xuanming pressed: "Why wasn't Guan Yu's identity verified? Why resort to execution?"

Guan Yu seized the narrative, feigning weakness: "Master! I declared myself repeatedly! Elder Dai called us conspirators! She nearly destroyed Senior Sister's cultivation and killed me!"

"What?!" Both Elders erupted.

Dai Qianjie attempted: "I merely sought to intimidate-"

"Lies!" Guan Yu interrupted dramatically. "She stole all my artifacts!"

Xuanming's voice turned glacial: "Junior Sister. Return his possessions immediately. You'll reflect deeply on this transgression."

Second-to-Wolf brandished his blade: "If Yunqing treats guests thus, keep your trinkets! We depart forever!"

Chapter 3149: Mere Intimidation Tactics

The hall tensed as Sect Leader and Elder Lu turned expectantly to Dai Qianjie. The artifacts' fate hung in balance, exposing deeper sect rivalries and the precariousness of Guan Yu's newfound status.
