“Aze was also speechless with shock. Usually, when he and Xiao Zhi came here, they only encountered pheasants, rabbits, or hedgehogs and birds – those were all they could catch.

Encountering such a massive wild boar, they wouldn’t dare approach it. To catch something like that, they’d need to use magic. But spells caused too much destruction and risked detection, so they couldn’t be used here.

Moreover, if the boar spotted them, it would attack. Every time, they had to release spiritual energy to scare it off.

‘Come on, stop gawking. Let’s haul this big guy over. Today we’ll feast properly!’ Guanyu said cheerfully.

Xiao Zhi and Aze were the most excited. Though they’d gotten pork from Qianhui Peak before, those were farm-raised pigs. They’d never tasted forest boar meat. They weren’t sure how it would taste, but believed it must be excellent.

Guanyu grabbed a hind leg while the other three each took a leg to lift the boar. Guanyu exclaimed, ‘Holy cow! This thing must weigh over two hundred jin! Second Brother, you actually carried this back from so far? That’s incredible!’

‘Can’t you see I’m exhausted? Stop making light of it. What about you? Catch anything good?’ Second-to-Wolf said nonchalantly. As a mid-level cultivator, he’d recover quickly after resting.

‘Two small hares – enough for three. But you brought this monster! We’ll need days to finish it,’ Guanyu laughed, thinking he wouldn’t have bothered with such an unwieldy prize.

The four carried the boar to the streamside. Xiao Zhi asked excitedly, ‘Second Brother, how did you kill and bring it back?’

Xiao Zhi reckoned even if he and Aze managed to kill a 200-jin boar, they couldn’t have carried it. The weight – over 100 jin per person – was too much for cultivators’ physiques over long distances.

Especially through this pathless thicket of trees and weeds. If it were them, stopping and starting, they’d barely make it back by dark – completely spent.

Second-to-Wolf shrugged. ‘Nothing special. I spotted it not far out. It attacked first, then fled when realizing its mistake. The cunning beast kept dodging through dense woods. When I closed in, it’d confront me, then bolt when I struck.

Finally I got serious. After killing it, I slit its neck to drain blood. Only then did I realize how far I’d chased it. With the dense forest, I had to navigate slowly while carrying it back.’

**Chapter 3281 How**

Aze gave Second-to-Wolf a thumbs-up. ‘I’m in awe, Second Brother! Carrying 200 jin all that way! Earlier we praised my Yunqing Sword, but your long blade doubling as a carrying pole? Genius!’

Guanyu said, ‘Aze, check the rabbits. Don’t let them burn. I’ll handle the boar.’

‘When the rabbits are done, give Second Brother first taste. There’s wine too – want a swig to recover?’ Aze said, running back to the fire.

‘Good. I’ll take that wine to regain strength,’ Second-to-Wolf chuckled. Guanyu drew his dagger and slit the boar’s belly.

When the rabbits roasted, Guanyu had already skinned the boar. They discarded head, tail and trotters, keeping four hams.

Xiao Zhi suggested, ‘Guanyu, let’s split the carcass and start roasting some. Agreed?’

‘Same thought. Take the rabbits off, we’ll roast pork next,’ Guanyu said, bisecting the boar. He discarded entrails into the stream and split the spine.

Xiao Zhi marveled, ‘That dagger’s incredibly sharp! Small but effective!’

‘This blade’s been with me years. Excellent weapon – I often fight with it,’ Guanyu said. It was the dagger Yang Conghan gave him.

After quartering the boar, Guanyu asked, ‘Xiao Zhi, this enough?’

Xiao Zhi nodded. Guanyu washed a portion in the stream, scoring the meat. ‘This helps seasoning penetrate. Makes tastier roast.’

‘So scholarly!’ Xiao Zhi praised. Guanyu thought it basic knowledge – surprising Xiao Zhi didn’t know.

‘You two done?’ Second-to-Wolf called. ‘Come eat! Half rabbit each. Perfectly roasted – delicious!’

**Chapter 3282 Impropriety**

As Second-to-Wolf drank and ate merrily with Aze, Xiao Zhi grew impatient. ‘Guanyu, you handle the pork. I’m starving!’

‘Go ahead. I’ll finish cleaning and start roasting,’ Guanyu replied.

After preparing pork, Guanyu stoked the fire before joining them.

Second-to-Wolf teased Xiao Zhi, ‘All meat no drink? Plenty wine left!’

Xiao Zhi’s face flushed red after one sip. ‘Sorry, Second Brother. Better stick to meat. Can’t hold liquor.’

‘True,’ Aze laughed. ‘Xiao Zhi’s a one-sip wonder!’

‘Haha! You can’t drink but always initiate toasts? Usually drinkers do that!’ Second-to-Wolf chuckled.

Xiao Zhi sighed. ‘Sometimes crave it, but two sips knock me out. Still… can’t resist occasionally.’

‘Better than nothing,’ Guanyu said. ‘Last time Xiao Zhi took four sips! With this tasty meat, he’ll drink less today.’

Time flew as they feasted. Soon only bones remained, and the wine was drained.

‘Time to head back,’ Guanyu reminded. ‘Aze has a match soon.’

‘What about leftover pork?’ Aze asked. ‘Let’s bundle it in branches and hang high. Preserve for next time.’

Guanyu agreed. Second-to-Wolf added, ‘Invite me next trip! Wild boar beats farmed any day. And don’t forget wine!’

Xiao Zhi promised, ‘I’ll handle the wine next time!’ They doused the fire with stream water and… other contributions, then departed.

Exiting woods, Guanyu said, ‘Almost match time. Hurry, Aze!’

Checking the sun, Aze nodded. ‘Perfect timing.’

Guanyu added, ‘Go ahead. I’ll nap – perfect after feast. Good luck!’

‘Don’t worry,’ Aze said confidently. ‘I’ll win that artifact. Few in Yunqing Sect can best me.’

**Chapter 3283 Possibility**

Returning to Xuanzhong Peak arena, Head Zheng approached. ‘Aze! Where were you? Your opponent changed to Huihe Peak’s Xiaochun. Go there now.’

‘What? Why a female disciple? Previous opponent withdraw?’ Aze asked.

‘Not sure. Just fight whoever. Go!’ Head Zheng said.

Xiao Zhi volunteered, ‘I’ll cheer you!’

Aze eyed him. ‘You just want to see Siqi. Hopeless.’

‘You know my feelings!’ Xiao Zhi grinned. ‘She’s in my bones…’

‘Disgusting!’ Aze shuddered. ‘Stay away from my match!’

Xiao Zhi caught up. ‘Can’t I support you?’

‘Drop the act. Since when do young men and women have “pure friendship”? None exists!’ Aze retorted.

Xiao Zhi insisted, ‘My feelings are pure!’

‘Only because you’re not even friends yet,’ Aze scoffed. ‘Face it – with Guanyu’s gifts and talent, Siqi will choose him.’

‘Can’t I admire her anyway?’ Xiao Zhi said stubbornly.

Arriving at Huihe Peak, crowds gathered – mostly female disciples and Zuokong Peak observers.

Xiao Zhi gaped. ‘So many people!’

Aze noted, ‘Zuokong disciples from last match. Wonder who won.’

Xiao Zhi’s eyes darted until spotting Xiaochun. ‘Xiaochun! Where’s Siqi?’

‘At Qianhui Peak’s match. Back later,’ she replied.
