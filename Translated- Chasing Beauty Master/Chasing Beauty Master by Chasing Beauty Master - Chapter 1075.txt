Today, Second to Wolf did not come. Previously, upon hearing news of Granny Yingshan, Second to Wolf went to investigate. Guan Yu urgently came here to cause trouble for Fang Su and didn't summon him, mainly because they hadn't anticipated such formidable experts by Fang Su's side before arriving.

Poison Widow carefully observed Guan Yu, stepping forward to whisper in Fang Su's ear, "That man called Guan Yu—are you certain he's an expert?"

Fang Su nodded without hesitation. "Absolutely. He's not just skilled but extraordinarily powerful. He even killed a First-Class Venerable expert."

"Are you sure?" Poison Widow's expression shifted strangely as she pressed.

Seeing her reaction, Fang Su hesitated. Cautiously, he asked, "Auntie, is something wrong? I haven't witnessed Guan Yu's prowess firsthand, but Young Master Feng of the Feng Family and Master Bill both attested to his capabilities. Previously, Young Master Feng spent heavily to hire two super First-Class Venerable assassins, both defeated by Guan Yu. Later, another First-Class Venerable named Ma He was also slain by him—this was personally witnessed by Young Master Feng."

Poison Widow's gaze remained fixed on Guan Yu. After Fang Su finished speaking, she nodded faintly in understanding. Though she scrutinized Guan Yu thoroughly, she detected no traces of cultivated internal energy. If Guan Yu were truly an expert, her own First-Class Venerable cultivation should have sensed something—unless his power far surpassed hers, reaching the Realm Venerable stage.

If Guan Yu were a Realm Venerable, tonight's battle would be futile. Surrendering outright would be their best option. Facing a Realm Venerable, Poison Widow lacked even the courage to fight—the gap was insurmountable.

Yet Realm Venerables exuded an innate majesty, their aura palpable without exertion. Guan Yu, however, appeared utterly ordinary, devoid of any discernible presence—indistinguishable from his subordinates.

Instead, the girl beside Guan Yu caught Poison Widow's attention. Her cultivation seemed comparable to Poison Widow's own.

Noticing Poison Widow's shifting expressions, Fang Su hesitantly asked, "Auntie, what's happening? Is there something wrong with Guan Yu?"

Poison Widow replied, "I'm uncertain. To me, Guan Yu shows no signs of cultivation—he seems completely ordinary. Why does everyone insist he's an expert?"

"Impossible! Countless witnesses attest to his power. When he stormed the Feng Family alone, he escaped despite being surrounded by hundreds and six snipers lying in wait. How could he be ordinary?" Fang Su argued.

Poison Widow frowned. "Two possibilities remain: either Guan Yu truly lacks cultivation, or he's a Realm Venerable. If the latter, we should flee immediately. Resistance would be futile."

"What? That can't be!" Fang Su blurted, hastily covering his mouth before glancing nervously at Guan Yu. "But earlier you said dealing with his group would be effortless!"

"Circumstances have changed," Poison Widow sighed. "I didn't know his true strength before. Regardless of Guan Yu's status, that girl beside him matches my cultivation level."

Fang Su recognized Xue Jing. He knew she was skilled, but if Poison Widow claimed their cultivation was comparable—what level did that imply?

Burning with curiosity, Fang Su asked, "What's Xue Jing's cultivation level? Have you discerned it?" Cleverly realizing their equivalence, he sought to deduce Poison Widow's own strength through comparison.

**Chapter 2749: Each One Is Hard to Part With**

"Who's Xue Jing?" Poison Widow inquired.

"The woman beside Guan Yu. I've known her—she's always followed him," Fang Su answered.

"If I'm not mistaken, she's a First-Class Venerable," Poison Widow declared shockingly. Fang Su's jaw dropped comically wide—enough for her to "see his stomach."

"Impossible! She's that powerful?"

"Would I jest at such a time?" Poison Widow rolled her eyes.

Though reluctant to believe, Fang Su reconsidered—if Poison Widow was also First-Class Venerable, his aunt's formidable status comforted him. Yet if Xue Jing matched her, who would handle Guan Yu? Glancing at the mute, dull-witted Ah Gou behind them, Fang Su dismissed relying on him—such hopes were futile.

"Situation's dire. What should we do?" Fang Su fretted.

Poison Widow mused, "I still doubt Guan Yu's purported strength. Best to force him into action—only then can we gauge his true power."

"Sounds feasible, but how? If he targets me first, I'm doomed!"

Accustomed to his cowardice, Poison Widow knew forcing Guan Yu's hand required sacrificial pawns—but she cherished every subordinate. "Devise a plan to provoke him. If circumstances worsen, we retreat immediately."

Fang Su's usually sharp mind faltered under pressure.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu observed their hushed conference. Though unheard, he knew they plotted countermeasures or awaited reinforcements. He allowed this—tonight's confrontation demanded resolution regardless of reinforcements.

Facing Poison Widow's caliber, Guan Yu refused to let Xue Jing or Jones risk themselves. Though Xue Jing appeared First-Class Venerable, sealed cultivation limited her true power. Jones's forces waited behind—while she might temporarily suppress Poison Widow, their equal cultivation made the risk untenable.

Guan Yu never gambled without certainty. Xue Jing had sensed numerous cultivators lurking—the battle's outcome remained unpredictable.

He awaited Monk Bai's arrival. If necessary, threats would suffice.

Regretting scarce manpower, Guan Yu lamented Yu Gang's limited forces—depleted further tonight, they'd be vulnerable to Bill Lin's retaliation.

After hesitation, Fang Su shouted, "Guan Yu! Why blockade my residence? Admiring the scenery? Our views pale compared to Qiaoyuan District's!"

"Surprisingly self-aware," Guan Yu sneered. "I've come to settle accounts. Sever one hand, and our feud ends. Spare others—fair terms?"

Fang Su feigned composure against Guan Yu's trademark arrogance. "Must we be so extreme? No alternatives?"

"Last time at Qiaoyuan District, I took Ge Ying and Sun Xu's limbs. You escaped then, only to return worse—sending assassins. Who's crueler?" Guan Yu retorted.

"Guan Yu, our feud needn't be mortal. You value wealth—let money resolve this."

Guan Yu laughed coldly. "I'll take your money and your hand! Mercy demands nothing less. Refuse, and I'll raze the Fang Estate tonight."

Inflamed by Guan Yu's audacity, Fang Su roared, "You dare threaten my family? My forces dwarf yours! Underestimate me at your peril!"

As prearranged, Poison Widow clapped twice. Over a hundred cultivators emerged from Fang Estate's walls and surrounding streets—blackening the landscape. Xue Jing had anticipated ambushers, though not this multitude.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Hiding them was pointless. Did you think numbers intimidate me? With your barely First-Class Venerable ally, you challenge me? Ignorant of my reputation?"

Though emboldened by his forces, Fang Su's confidence wavered. Guan Yu's taunts made his heart pound—fear threatening to overwhelm him.

Poison Widow stepped forward. "Young man, curb your arrogance. Though outnumbered, we'll make victory costly. Spare my nephew, and we negotiate."

Locking eyes across the distance, Guan Yu noted her thick makeup. "Fang Su's your nephew? Remarkable—this fool has a First-Class Venerable aunt. What faction claims you?"

"Dark Sun Society. Small but growing. Join us, and I'll grant leadership."

Guan Yu summoned Jones, previously waiting in vehicles. Recognizing Poison Widow, Jones exclaimed, "Poison Widow?"

"Freedom Leader? What coincidence!" Poison Widow countered.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow—unexpected acquaintances. Jones sneered, "No coincidence. I assist my man here. You? Taken up with this pretty boy?"

Unfazed, Poison Widow retorted, "My affairs concern you not. When did you shack up with this pretty face?"

"Our relationship's legitimate. Must I report to you?" Jones smirked. "Fang boy—beware! She murdered her husband and unborn child. Seek death elsewhere?"

Poison Widow paled at the exposure. Fang Su whispered, "Auntie, you know her?"

"We've crossed paths. Competed for deals—she's ruthless. Situation deteriorates."

Guan Yu asked Jones, "You know this crone?"

"One of Jianghu's Ten Villains. We nearly clashed before mediators intervened. Now she consorts with Fang whelps."

"Poison Widow's his aunt," Guan Yu noted, adding another Ten Villains foe to his list—Granny Yingshan escaped, Sky Wolf crippled, now this.

Xue Jing gasped, "Sister Jones! She truly killed her husband and child?" Mimicking a pregnant belly.

"Precisely. She was ordinary once—infatuated with a man her family opposed. Discovering his affair while pregnant, she slaughtered the lovers, then ripped out her full-term baby and strangled it!"

**Chapter 2750: Legitimate Relationship**

Poison Widow's estimation of Guan Yu rose—he'd anticipated her hidden forces, remaining unperturbed by their appearance.

Guan Yu taunted, "Fang Su! Think these pawns and your novice First-Class Venerable threaten me? Underestimate me at your peril!"

Though surrounded, Fang Su's courage crumbled. Guan Yu's reputation loomed larger than any numerical advantage.

Poison Widow interjected, "Reckless words, boy! Though fewer, we'll make you bleed. Spare my nephew, and terms favor you."

Guan Yu's piercing gaze noted her caked makeup across the distance. "Your nephew? This idiot's family surprises. What cabal spawned you?"

"Dark Sun Society. Modest but ambitious. Join, and lead."

Summoning Jones revealed unexpected familiarity. "Poison Widow?" Jones exclaimed.

"Freedom Leader! Strange meeting," Poison Widow countered.

Guan Yu inquired about Dark Sun's strength, but Jones volleyed, "My man handles business here. You? Bedding this pup?"

"None of your concern," Poison Widow shot back. "Since when do you dally with pretty boys?"

"Legitimate lovers need no excuses," Jones smirked. "Fang child—flee this husband-killer! She murders babes in wombs!"

Poison Widow's composure cracked. Fang Su whispered, "You know her?"

"Business rivals. She's vicious. Situation worsens."

Guan Yu queried Jones, "You know this hag?"

"Ten Villains member. Nearly fought before. Now she toys with Fang trash."

"His aunt," Guan Yu noted, tallying another Villains feud.

Xue Jing gasped, "She truly killed her family?"

Jones confirmed grimly, "Ripped her child out—full term—and killed it."
