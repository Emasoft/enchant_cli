Guan Yu understood Song Shaoqin's implication—this young man was apparently a legendary "death warrior"? Meaning he carried something that could harm them?

Activating his detection system, Guan Yu inhaled sharply. The bastard had truly gone all out! Through the scanning interface, he clearly sensed high-intensity explosives concealed on the youth. Though unsure of the blast radius, detonation in this small club would undoubtedly injure multiple people. Given their proximity, he and his group would bear the brunt.

**Chapter 1021: An Unexpected Conclusion**

While Guan Yu's gravity system could ensure his swift escape with Wen Qing, abandoning Lin Dong and Lin Ling was unthinkable. More crucially, Li Xi remained with them.

"Damn it! Song Shaoqin, you’re truly ruthless!"

"Hah! Guan Yu, you forced my hand! Beating Song Dawei was one thing, but laying hands on *me*? Do you think I’m some punching bag?" Song Shaoqin laughed maniacally, bordering on derangement.

Guan Yu feared no shrewd opponent, but lunatics unnerved him—especially armed ones. Waving dismissively, he cut off the grating laughter: "Enough! Song Shaoqin, you win! I’ll go with you!"

As Guan Yu moved to follow, Dongfang Mu materialized unexpectedly, blocking his path. "Brother Guan, where are you headed?"

"Ahem... Young Master Song insists on hosting me. Reluctant as I am, I’ve no choice." Guan Yu blinked, baffled. Hadn’t this man witnessed the entire spectacle? Unbeknownst to him, Dongfang Mu had been engrossed in the club’s antiques and artworks throughout the commotion.

To Dongfang Mu, cultural treasures eclipsed all worldly affairs.

Frowning at Guan Yu’s reply, Dongfang Mu turned to Song Shaoqin: "Why force him if he’s unwilling?"

"Brother Dongfang! Song’s plotting revenge—he wants to abduct Guan Yu!" Wang Dahu interjected. Unlike Guan Yu, Wang understood Dongfang Mu’s background—the Dongfang family rivaled the Songs in influence, with deeper military-political ties.

"Is this true?" Dongfang Mu’s gaze sharpened.

"Does Brother Dongfang intend to interfere?" Song Shaoqin’s bravado faltered. Provoking the Dongfang heir could spell disaster for the Song family.

"Interfere? Whatever grievance you hold against Brother Guan, you’re not taking him tonight. I require his assistance." Dismissing Song, Dongfang addressed Guan Yu: "You’re Guan Yu? Meet me tomorrow afternoon—we’re visiting a location." Without awaiting confirmation, he strode off, leaving the crowd stupefied.

Guan Yu stared after him. The man’s audacity! Yet refusal seemed impossible. Would Dongfang’s name truly deter Song?

Wang Dahu whispered admiringly: "When did you connect with the Dongfang clan? Had you invoked Dongfang Mu earlier, this farce would’ve ended hours ago!"

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Had he known Dongfang’s clout outweighed Song’s, he’d have name-dropped immediately. Only fools spurn powerful allies.

"You’ve lucked out this time, Guan Yu! This isn’t over!" After tense deliberation, Song Shaoqin departed. With the Dongfang family’s intervention, annihilating Guan Yu risked catastrophic repercussions. Let Hong Kong allies deal with him later—the Song patriarch wouldn’t let this insult stand...

As Song exited, Li Mufeng’s hopes of exploiting the situation evaporated. With a sigh, he too left.

Only Guan Yu’s group and spectators remained. Li Bing had fled earlier, unwilling to challenge Guan Yu’s rising star. Song Qifeng approached Li Xi hesitantly: "Xi’er, let me drive you home."

Li Xi glanced at Guan Yu. "Unnecessary. I have my car."

......

"Brother Guan! Shouldn’t you celebrate with drinks?" Zhu Zixiang of the Zhu family—who’d withdrawn earlier—approached obsequiously.

"Indeed!" added Cao Qiang of the Cao family. "None defy the Songs unscathed. Your survival’s unprecedented!"

These opportunists sought to leverage Guan Yu’s Dongfang connection. Guan Yu saw through their hypocrisy: "Should I light fireworks to thank the Songs for sparing me?"

Flustered, they persisted: "Our families aided the Wens and Lius... Perhaps you could introduce us to the Dongfangs?"

Guan Yu laughed mirthlessly: "You jest, surely? Why would I facilitate that?"

**Chapter 1022: A Theatrical Conclusion**

The Song-Guan feud paused its theatrics. Though unresolved, Guan Yu remained unperturbed—so long as his loved ones weren’t targeted, he could manage.

As the club emptied, attendees reevaluated their assumptions. Previously seen merely as the Wen family’s son-in-law, Guan Yu’s Dongfang-backed defiance of the Songs reshaped perceptions.

Families who’d withdrawn faced Guan Yu’s scorn. Zhu Zixiang, Cao Qiang, and others departed ruefully—their wavering loyalty cost them potential alliances. Neutral observers relished their comeuppance: alignment errors carried steep prices.

......

"Brother Guan, I’m Zhou Kang—Jiang Zigi’s associate." A group approached. "We apologize for not supporting you earlier, but the Songs..."

Jiang Zigi smirked wordlessly. Guan Yu waved: "I understand. You didn’t join the Songs—that’s support enough."

Zhou Kang brightened: "Your magnanimity ensures future greatness beyond Song Shaoqin’s!"

Wen Qing beamed proudly while Guan Yu suppressed eye-rolls. These sycophants praised him solely for the Dongfang association.

Concluding, Guan Yu declared: "As Jiang’s brother, you’re acquaintances now. Let’s interact more."

Jiang Zigi thrilled—Guan Yu’s acknowledgment elevated his status among peers. Zhou Kang’s faction swallowed bitterness, realizing Jiang now held the key to Guan Yu’s circle.

Post-departures, Wang Dahu’s faction remained. Guan Yu thanked them sincerely.

Wang clapped Guan Yu’s shoulder: "No formalities! Though initially here on family orders, your mettle impressed me. In Kyoto, the Wangs stand with you!"

Only Guan Yu’s inner circle lingered—Wen Qing, Lin Dong, Lin Ling, Li Xi, and Mu Xiyan.

Li Xi glanced at Guan Yu: "I’ll take Lin Ling."

"Let me escort you," Guan Yu offered.

Li Xi’s gaze flicked to Wen Qing: "Accompany your wife. I have my car."

Wen Qing smiled sweetly, fingers surreptitiously pinching Guan Yu’s waist: "Darling, ensure Miss Li’s safety."

Gritting through pain, Guan Yu vowed nighttime retribution.

Li Xi demurred: "Lin Ling and I will go together."

"But I want Lin Dong to take me home!" Lin Ling pouted.

Li Xi’s glare brooked no refusal. Reluctantly, Lin Ling acquiesced.

As Li Xi’s group left, Mu Xiyan pouted: "Abandoning me, Guan Yu?"

Wen Qing bristled: "Why should he care about you?"

"You permitted Li Xi!"

"Li Xi’s his business partner. What’s your relation?"

Mu Xiyan clung to Guan Yu’s arm: "It’s dangerous for a girl alone at night..."

Her kittenish plea nearly swayed Guan Yu until Wen Qing’s pinch revived him. "Miss Mu, we’re strangers—and I’m your ‘Shàoqīn gege’s’ enemy."

"I like whom I choose. I’m pursuing you—won’t you give me a chance?"

Guan Yu nearly succumbed to her charms. Ultimately, Wen Qing relented—Mu Xiyan could ride along temporarily.

**Chapter 1023: Agony and Ecstasy**

Guan Yu sighed internally: being devastatingly handsome truly was a curse.
