During the meal, Uncle proved quite talkative, chatting about everything under the sun. When topics ran dry, he unexpectedly began recounting his business experiences.

"Let me tell you," Uncle said, leaning forward, "my main trade is fabrics. Though I dabble in smaller ventures, our entire family depends on this cloth business. Last year, I met this peculiar client—a woman around forty from out of town. Came to discuss business, but really just wanted to take advantage of me!"

He chuckled dryly. "She proposed using our family's fabric-making techniques to produce goods elsewhere, offering me a cut. If sales went well, she even suggested branching into clothing. Can you believe it? Our textile methods are ancestral secrets! Sharing them would be commercial suicide. Letting others profit from our craftsmanship? That's outright theft!"

**Chapter 3410: Using One's Head in Business**

"So, Uncle, did you agree?" Xiao Zhi asked curiously.

"Of course not! Only a fool would hand over golden geese. Our fabrics must stay in our hands to maximize profits. Why let others reap rewards?"

Guan Yu observed Uncle's honest demeanor—his square-jawed face and unpretentious bearing belying his wealth.

Xiao Zhi laughed. "Uncle's shrewdness proves years in trade aren't wasted. Had it been me, I might've taken that easy money!"

"Ha! Trying to swindle me? Not a chance," Uncle retorted, slapping the table.

Guan Yu understood: someone had sought franchising, but Uncle's rigid approach rejected it. Perhaps with guidance, his business could expand further. That such a conservative man built this empire hinted at hidden cunning. One well-placed suggestion might enlighten him.

"Uncle—forgive the familiarity, but since Xiao Zhi calls you Uncle, may I too?" Guan Yu inquired politely.

"Of course! Consider yourselves my nephews," Uncle boomed. "Speak freely!"

Guan Yu nodded. "Actually, I believe that client wasn't swindling you. Her proposal had merit."

"Don't jest, Guan Yu!" Xiao Zhi waved dismissively. "This was clearly a scam. You lack business experience."

"I've handled larger enterprises than Uncle's," Guan Yu stated solemnly.

Had others made such claims, Xiao Zhi and A'Ze might've laughed themselves sick. Yet Guan Yu's earnest delivery commanded belief—even Si Qi beside them nodded. Such was his charisma: his words carried innate credibility.

Intrigued, Uncle leaned in. "I'd like to hear your perspective. Business discussions always excite me!"

Guan Yu began, "Take my hometown example. I started selling skewered meat on the streets. Though competitors abounded, my secret seasoning made 'Guan Yu Skewers' wildly popular. Demand overwhelmed supply—I could grill ten skewers every ten minutes. Even working dawn to dusk, maximum daily earnings capped at five hundred coins. At that rate, wealth would take decades."

"Then I franchised. Sold my brand and seasoning recipes. For five thousand coins per franchisee, hundreds joined. Within two years, 'Guan Yu Skewers' spread nationwide. Five hundred franchises meant millions earned—what would've taken twenty-five years of grilling. Your fabrics enjoy similar fame. That client likely sought franchising—an expansion opportunity."

Uncle stroked his chin, digesting this. "Two years' earnings surpassing twenty-five... Remarkable!" He raised his cup admiringly. "A toast to your brilliance!"

Xiao Zhi grinned. "Guan Yu, even Uncle praises you! Since when did you master commerce?"

Guan Yu shrugged. Franchising was commonplace in cities, but explaining complex distribution chains to them seemed futile.

**Chapter 3411: One Too Many Drinks**

Uncle still frowned. "But if others learn your methods, why pay franchise fees? Couldn't they counterfeit 'Guan Yu Skewers'?"

"Back home, we register brands legally," Guan Yu explained. "Unauthorized imitations get reported. Authorities shut them down for infringement. Similarly, franchise contracts should specify territories and scales to control quality and distribution."

Nodding slowly, Uncle declared, "You're extraordinary, Guan Yu! At my age, hearing such innovative strategies... This wisdom must be recorded in our family annals for future generations!"

"You flatter me," Guan Yu demurred. "Just knowledge from my homeland."

The feast concluded merrily, with Guan Yu drinking heavily alongside Uncle.

**Next Morning**

Guan Yu awoke past ten, head throbbing. The others waited impatiently in the front hall.

"Finally up?" Xiao Zhi teased. "We're visiting Duobao Mountain. It's five li north."

Guan Yu grimaced. "No rush. That mountain's swarming with sects, yet none found the entrance. Heard Demon Sect scouts died exploring caves there."

Xiao Zhi blinked. "How'd you know? Father updates me via this." He produced a black ingot-shaped device. "Channel spiritual energy, and it links to his counterpart. We can communicate across distances!"

"Video calls? Impressive!" Guan Yu marveled.

"Recent invention post-Dharma Cauldron enlightenment," Xiao Zhi preened. "Soul Arts let me craft tools and tame spirit beasts. Once my cultivation deepens, I'll forge mighty artifacts!"

"Damn! Can you refine magical items now?" A'Ze exclaimed.

"Basic ones only. But someday..." Xiao Zhi's eyes shone.

Guan Yu clasped his shoulder. "Your potential's limitless."

"Praise from Guan Yu? My mother always said I'd shine!" Xiao Zhi beamed.

**Chapter 3413: Framed**

As they neared Duobao Mountain, two Red Lotus Sect disciples accosted them.

"Thieves! Return Senior Brother's jade pendant!" the woman brandished her sword.

Guan Yu turned lazily. "Proof? By your logic, my missing purse must be your theft!"

"Lies!" the man, Yue Jing, spat. "Our pendant vanished after encountering you beggars!"

A'Ze slammed the table. "Scram before we teach manners!"

Unfazed, the pair drew blades. Accustomed to bullying juniors, they sneered at these "commoners."

Guan Yu smirked. Let the flies buzz. Their sect's darlings would learn humility soon enough.
