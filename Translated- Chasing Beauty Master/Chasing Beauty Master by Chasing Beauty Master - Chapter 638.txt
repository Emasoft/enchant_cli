“Let’s play it by ear! It’d be best if she doesn’t recognize you!” Sun Xiaoya, who was opening the door, blinked uncertainly.

Yet against all hopes, the moment the door swung open, the same elderly woman from last night rushed over excitedly. Upon seeing Guan Yu, her face blossomed into a radiant smile as she chattered incessantly, “You’re back! Quick, quick, change your shoes! It’s so good you’re back!”

Guan Yu forced an awkward smile, swapped into slippers, and was promptly dragged by the hand to sit on the sofa by the enthusiastic woman.

“Why are you so busy? You didn’t come home all night! Your mother worried herself sick! No more staying out overnight, understand?”

“Ah! Yes, understood!” Guan Yu nodded stiffly, his face rigid.

Sun Xiaoya rolled her eyes helplessly, then said flatly to Guan Yu, “Keep my mom company. I’ll make dinner.”

After changing into loungewear, Sun Xiaoya tied on an apron and busied herself in the kitchen, leaving Guan Yu alone in the living room to endure the confused old lady’s chatter.

“Child, look how wonderful your wife is! So diligent, right? She’s just a bit cold on the outside and has a temper, but her heart’s warm!”

Guan Yu nodded repeatedly, offering vague responses.

**Chapter 1621: Stay Here Tonight**

Against all expectations, the elderly woman from last night rushed to the door the moment it opened. Beaming at Guan Yu like a sunflower, she prattled, “You’re back! Quick, change your shoes! So good you’re back!”

Guan Yu smiled awkwardly, changed into slippers, and was pulled onto the sofa.

“Why were you so busy? Out all night! Your mother worried all evening! No more staying out, understand?”

“Ah! Yes, understood!” Guan Yu nodded stiffly.

Sun Xiaoya sighed, shooting him a glance. “Keep my mom company. I’ll cook.”

After changing clothes, Sun Xiaoya worked in the kitchen, abandoning Guan Yu to the old woman’s relentless chatter.

“Your wife’s so good! Hardworking! Just a bit cold-tempered, but kind inside!”

Guan Yu nodded robotically.

Half an hour later, dinner was ready. The three sat at the table.

“I’ll serve myself!” Guan Yu stood hastily as Sun Xiaoya reached for his bowl.

“Let your wife do it! Sit!” The old woman pressed his shoulder down, smiling.

As they ate “harmoniously,” sweat dripped from Guan Yu’s brow. *Heavens, this warmth is overwhelming!*

While cleaning up, Guan Yu whispered in the kitchen, “Should I leave now, Teacher Sun?”

Sun Xiaoya massaged her temples. “Wait till Mom sleeps. I’ll take you back later.”

“Alright.”

But the old woman, as if energized, rambled endlessly in the living room about marital harmony, repeating advice like a broken record. Sun Xiaoya calmly retreated to her room, leaving Guan Yu stranded.

By 8 PM, after two hours of nonstop chatter, Guan Yu was drenched in sweat. *How is she so energetic?!*

“Mom, why don’t you watch TV? I need to… discuss something with Xiaoya,” Guan Yu interjected weakly.

“Why ‘Xiaoya’? She’s your wife!” the woman huffed.

“It’s a pet name. Young folks use them!” Guan Yu’s smile strained.

“Fine! Go!” The woman chuckled, waving them off.

Relieved, Guan Yu scurried to Sun Xiaoya’s door—only for her to open it first.

“Teacher Sun, your mom won’t sleep!” He wiped his brow.

“Wait here.” Sun Xiaoya pointed to her bed before leaving.

Alone in her fragrant, cozy room, Guan Yu fidgeted until Sun Xiaoya returned, defeated. “She’s engrossed in TV.”

Guan Yu nearly wept. *This is psychological torture!*

Checking her watch, Sun Xiaoya sighed. “It’s 9 PM. She won’t sleep soon. Stay the night?”

“What?!” Guan Yu’s mind raced. *Stay? With her? A stunning beauty… But is this proper?*

Sun Xiaoya rolled her eyes. “Or wait longer.”

“But… what if your future husband finds out?”

“What husband? Nonsense!” She glared.

*Unmarried? Then why the matchmaking?* Guan Yu puzzled.

“I’m letting you stay so you’ll rest well for class. Take the floor.” She tossed him a tracksuit.

“Floor?!” Guan Yu grimaced.

“Want me to sleep there instead?” She arched a brow.

After she showered, the sound of water and TV tormented Guan Yu. *The floor it is.*

Returning in pajamas, her cheeks flushed, Sun Xiaoya ordered, “Your turn to shower.”

In the bathroom, Guan Yu pondered the absurdity. *A grown man and teacher sharing a room?*

Later, lying on the floor, he meditated until midnight—when Sun Xiaoya’s restless breaths betrayed her wakefulness.

“Teacher Sun? Asleep?” He approached her bed.

She froze, silent.

Chuckling, Guan Yu grabbed his pillow. “I’ll sleep on the couch.”

Sneaking out, he settled on the sofa—only for the old woman to shriek upon spotting him during a midnight bathroom trip.

Lights blazed. “Why’s he here? Did you fight?!”

“No! Just… needed air!” Guan Yu fibbed.

“Lies! Xiaoya, let him sleep properly!” The woman confiscated his floor bedding, forcing him back into the bedroom.

Trapped, Sun Xiaoya grumbled, “Now we can’t even sleep apart!”

**Chapter 1622: Another Fight?**

The old woman’s sharp eyes caught the missing bedding. “You *are* fighting! Share the bed!”

Helpless, the pair stood awkwardly.

“This is your fault!” Sun Xiaoya hissed.

Guan Yu sighed. *So much for chivalry.*

**Chapter 1623: Sleepless Night**

The old woman’s decree left them no escape. Under her watchful eye, they reluctantly prepared to share the room—a night of tension and unspoken thoughts ahead.
