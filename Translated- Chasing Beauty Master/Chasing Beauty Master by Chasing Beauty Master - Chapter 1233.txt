“Of course there was,” Elder Jiu nodded. “She said she wanted to elope with me, to leave this place forever and find a sanctuary where we could live free from the endless conflicts between righteous sects and the Demon Sect. But I refused. I couldn’t abandon my sworn brother or the Azure Cloud Sect we’d built together. Our sect was our life’s work. Had I left then, my brother would’ve crumbled under the pressure from the orthodox factions. So I returned here, even if it meant risking my life to protect Azure Cloud.”

“She must have hated you deeply?” Guan Yu ventured cautiously.

Elder Jiu’s gaze grew distant. “At the time, she defied immense pressure to be with me—even dismissed the Demon Sect Leader’s warnings. She was ready to abandon everything. Yet I betrayed her trust for the sect.” He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a jagged scar on his wrist. “She bit me so fiercely here, tearing flesh in her despair. That expression…I’ll never forget it.”

“Elder Jiu,” Guan Yu pressed, “after all these years, have you never tried to find her?” However tangled their past, decades had passed. Two souls once bound by love—surely time could mend old wounds.

But who knew what bitterness lingered in her heart? Hatred born of love often outlives even memory.

From his robes, Elder Jiu withdrew a milky-white triangular jade pendant, its surface polished to a mirror gleam. A crimson antique knot dangled beneath it. At its center glimmered a heart-shaped contour—imperfect yet unmistakable, as though nature herself had etched it.

“Guan Yu,” the elder said gravely, “once your cultivation reaches its preliminary stage, Patriarch Xuanming will send you下山. When that day comes, I ask a favor of you.”

“Command me, Elder. I’ll see it done.”

“The Demon Sect stirs again. Their forces mass near Northern Ning Town—for what purpose, we’ve yet to discern. A century has passed since the last Great Sect War, and their ambitions brew anew. Our righteous factions cannot idly watch their resurgence. Your mission will be to uncover their schemes. Take this pendant.” He pressed the jade into Guan Yu’s palm. “Find someone named Yin Bingshan.”

Guan Yu studied the relic. “If I may ask…is this Yin Bingshan the one you’ve long yearned for?”

The elder nodded without hesitation. “We crafted these matching pendants when we first met. Hers is a smaller triangle, but their essence mirrors each other. Should you find her, give her this. Tell her…through all these years, I’ve never forgotten.”

Admiration warmed Guan Yu’s chest. Here was a man who loved fiercely, acted decisively—no regrets, no half-measures. This errand wasn’t merely delivery of a trinket, but an olive branch across decades of silence.

“Upon my下山, locating Yin Bingshan will be my first priority,” Guan Yu vowed. “I’ll place this in her hands myself.”

Their conversation stretched through the night until Xiao Dong’s sudden appearance startled them. The deaf-mute servant emerged rubbing sleep from his eyes, gesturing urgently. Dawn’s first light spilled over the horizon—they’d talked till morning unnoticed.

“Heh, daybreak already,” Elder Jiu chuckled, rising. “Xiao Dong prepares breakfast. Let us freshen up.”

As they walked back, Guan Yu realized how starved the elder must have been for companionship. With Xiao Dong unable to converse, these midnight talks had become rare solace.

“Rest today, Elder,” Guan Yu urged. “We can begin infusing the Imperial Seal tomorrow.”

“Nonsense! After breakfast, we’ll start. Sleepless nights are my custom.” The elder waved dismissively, then froze. His gaze sharpened toward the gate. “Visitors at this hour? Guan Yu, go see.”

Memories of Dai Shouzuo and Siqi flashed in Guan Yu’s mind. He hurried to unbolt the Ancestral Hall’s massive doors. There they stood—the stern-faced聚合峰leader and her disciple, anticipation crackling between them.

“Did I come too early?” Siqi asked, though her usual ice-mask demeanor couldn’t hide the eagerness in her posture. Beside her, Dai Shouzuo’s eyes locked onto the jade ruyi Guanyu produced.

“This is for Siqi,” Guan Yu warned as the聚合峰leader reached greedily. He pulled the artifact back. “Your role today is only to sever her current sword’s bond.”

Dai Shouzuo flushed, composing herself. “Merely wished to inspect it. Such a treasure…”

The ruyi’s history loomed between them—a legendary Demon Sect relic from bygone wars, now to be wielded by a righteous disciple. As procedures began, Guan Yu watched Dai Shouzuo’s hands dance through intricate seals, blue light unraveling from Siqi’s blade like captured moonlight.

“Looks simple,” Guan Yu remarked as the sword’s glow faded.

“Appearances deceive,” Dai Shouzuo warned. “Adepts have gone mad or died attempting this. The artifact’s rank demands corresponding strength. This ruyi? Only a Half-Immortal could break its bond once forged.”

When Siqi finally clasped the ruyi, its aura shifted from ochre-black to cerulean—acceptance. Though her face remained impassive as jade, joy radiated through her fingertips’ reverent touch.

“Thank you,” she murmured, the words warmer than any smile. “I’ll cherish this.”

As the聚合峰pair departed, Elder Jiu clucked reproachfully. “Gifting such a treasure after one day? Smitten indeed!”

Guan Yu grinned sheepishly. “What can I say? Her beauty bewitched me. Besides—it suits her perfectly.”

“Ha! Straightforward as ever. A man’s heart should guide his actions boldly.” The elder’s laughter echoed through dawn-lit halls. “Now rest. Our real work begins.”
