Guanyu observed for a moment before remarking, "This bamboo flute could be considered a mid-grade magical artifact, though of ordinary quality. Compared to the beast hide you presented earlier, it falls somewhat short. After all, these white gemstones aren't particularly high-grade."

Elder Zhao's nostrils flared with barely contained fury. "Guanyu!" he snapped, face darkening. "Are you deliberately causing trouble here? First you dismiss my rice paper as unremarkable, now you claim this flute inferior to that paper! What precisely is your intention?"

Guanyu paused, recognizing some validity in the accusation. His arbitrary comparisons did seem unfair. With a rueful smile, he turned to the True Yang Sect's elder. "Honored Elder, perhaps you could now display your treasure for our appreciation?"

Guanyu remained confident. Since the True Yang elder had agreed to this competition, he must possess worthy items - to appear empty-handed would be humiliating.

"Elder Zhao's flute is indeed commendable," the True Yang elder said smoothly, producing his own instrument. "But perhaps you'd care to evaluate mine?"

The new flute bore superficial similarities to Zhao's bamboo model, yet differed crucially. Where Zhao's instrument had white gemstones at the finger holes, this one bore a single quail-egg-sized emerald at its end - clearly the spiritual energy reservoir.

Guanyu approached for closer inspection. "Comparing the two," he announced, "Elder Zhao's pales in comparison. While both are bamboo flutes, the spiritual gemstones tell the tale. Multiple common white stones versus a single premium green gem. If Elder Zhao's flute barely qualifies as mid-grade, this True Yang artifact solidly occupies that tier. My judgment declares the True Yang Sect victorious over Crimson Lotus this round."

Chapter 4659: The Dagger

"Your evaluations focus only on crude comparisons!" Elder Zhao protested. "Practical utility matters more than superficial grading! My multi-gem design allows far more convenient spiritual energy storage and channeling than their single-stone contrivance!"

While Zhao's argument held technical merit regarding functionality, none could deny the True Yang flute's superior material quality.

Guanyu raised his hands placatingly. "The decision rests with me. True Yang's entry demonstrates slight superiority. I trust Elder Zhao accepts this ruling?"

With the coveted Bloodstone at stake and Guanyu's authority established, Zhao had little recourse. "Very well," he conceded bitterly. "For fairness' sake, we'll proceed. Let True Yang present first in the next round!"

The Crimson Lotus elder now preferred reacting rather than initiating, hoping to counter rather than be countered.

True Yang's elder assessed the situation. Prolonged competition risked uncertain outcomes. Best to stake everything on his finest treasure. Normally he'd hesitate to reveal such wealth, but the Bloodstone's allure outweighed caution.

From his robes emerged a small dagger - utterly mundane in appearance, its gray patina suggesting neglected rust. Even Guanyu appeared perplexed. Though privately inclined toward True Yang due to disliking Crimson Lotus, this "treasure" strained credibility.

Noticing the skepticism, the elder maintained composure. He angled the dagger for inspection without relinquishing it. Only when Guanyu drew near did details emerge - the gray hue stemmed not from corrosion, but from the entire object being carved from jade!

"A gray jade imitation dagger?" Guanyu breathed in realization.

"Precisely," the elder confirmed with quiet pride. "Not forged metal, but unworked precious stone naturally formed in this shape."

The twenty-centimeter jade piece, though unrefined, pulsed with latent potential. "This raw jade hasn't been spiritually refined yet," Guanyu observed. "Not truly a magical artifact."

"Correct," the elder nodded. "Like your Bloodstone, its current form belies glorious potential. Proper refinement will unveil its splendor."

From across the room, Elder Zhao's mocking laughter rang out. "You consider unworked stone a treasure? Until refined, it's worthless! Are True Yang's coffers so empty you must peddle raw materials as artifacts?"

True Yang's elder countered coolly, "Our wager concerned treasures carried, not operational artifacts. Unless you claim the Bloodstone itself is worthless?"

Guanyu interjected, "Elder Zhao, by your logic, this Bloodstone I hold would also be mere rock. Should I gift it to True Yang then?"

"Enough sophistry!" Zhao spluttered. "We compete through actual treasures, not geological specimens! Produce real artifacts or concede!"

Guanyu raised an eyebrow. "The jade's inherent value is evident. Your move, Elder Zhao. What comparable treasure can Crimson Lotus present?"

Chapter 4660: The Debate

Zhao's face darkened. "This crude stone doesn't qualify! Unrefined materials are like unproven cultivators - potential means nothing until realized! Would you fear some novice claiming to be future archmage?"

Guanyu frowned at the flawed analogy, but True Yang's elder struck back: "By your measure, our contested Bloodstone is equally worthless. Shall we abandon our competition over 'mere rocks' then?"

The rhetorical thrust found its mark. Zhao blustered, "Don't twist words! The Bloodstone's status is established! That dagger-jade isn't!"

"Then produce Crimson Lotus' counter!" Guanyu demanded.

Zhao knew he couldn't match the jade's latent value. His remaining artifacts paled in comparison. "This... this farce proves nothing!" he deflected. "True Yang's destitution forces them to peddle uncut stone as treasure!"

True Yang's elder sighed. "Must you persist in shifting goalposts? First challenge, then rule-changing when outmatched?"

Tension thickened as both factions recognized the impasse. True Yang's humble circumstances became apparent - years of hiding from the Demon Soul Sect's predation had impoverished them. Their isolation, meant to foster growth, instead caused decline through lost disciples and stagnant resources. Meanwhile, their persecutors flourished.

Chapter 4661: The Chasm

"Without agreed rules," the True Yang elder said wearily, "this contest becomes meaningless. You alter terms to ensure victory."

Zhao crossed his arms. "My terms are simple: operational artifacts only. That stone doesn't qualify."

Guanyu intervened: "Then let's establish clear criteria. Do we judge inherent value or current utility?"

Before Zhao could respond, the True Yang elder produced documentation. "This jade's provenance..." he began, but Zhao waved dismissively.

"Enough! Crimson Lotus withdraws from this farcical..." His tirade died as the elder activated the jade, emitting a resonant hum that silenced the hall. Latent power shimmered across its surface.

Guanyu's eyes widened. "It's... already partially attuned!"

The revelation hung heavily. Zhao's face purpled with rage and humiliation, understanding dawning - True Yang's apparent poverty concealed unexpected depths. The game had changed.
