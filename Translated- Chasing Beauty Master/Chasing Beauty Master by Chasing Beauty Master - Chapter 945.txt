“Second to Wolf also witnessed this situation, and by now the enemy had completely ceased their attacks. Seizing the opportunity, Second to Wolf swung his long blade continuously as a blood-red mist gradually rose around him, growing denser by the moment.

Even Guan Yu felt a sliver of fear from the murderous aura Second to Wolf unleashed. After continuous swings, the man became entirely enveloped in the crimson fog, leaving only the crescent-shaped sword energies visible as they shot outward.

The power of a First-Class Venerable Mid Rank was no joke. When Third Brother swung his great blade at the blood mist, his attack was devoured instantly. Though the moment was brief, Guan Yu clearly saw the shock flashing across Third Brother's face.

The attack methods of Second and Third Brothers were peculiar. While Guan Yu's shield possessed reflective properties, their assaults primarily combined pure physical strikes with spiritual attacks, rendering his shield's rebound effect nearly useless.

Now, the sword energies released by Second to Wolf all glowed blood-red. Each crescent-shaped wave, over a meter long, continuously flew from the crimson mist. When Third Brother defiantly struck again with his blade, even Guan Yu was startled.

Third Brother's great blade must have altered its attack method. As a First-Class Venerable, his strikes carried razor-sharp precision, the accompanying soul attack even affecting Guan Yu. This single slash actually cleaved Second to Wolf's blood mist cleanly in two.

Yet no physical body existed within the divided mist. The severed crimson fog slowly reunited, restoring itself to its original form within the blink of an eye as sword energies continued pouring forth unabated.

Witnessing this, Guan Yu felt renewed astonishment. This was the true Second to Wolf - the consummate skills of a top-tier First-Class Venerable Mid Rank assassin.

Guan Yu couldn't discern the nature of this technique. Perhaps Second to Wolf concealed himself within some hidden corner, or perhaps he had truly transformed into the blood mist itself.

The sword energies from the red fog multiplied and accelerated. Within mere breaths, the fierce crimson crescents seemed to breach the enemy's defensive barrier while dispersing much of the surrounding poison gas. As the miasma thinned, Guan Yu finally glimpsed their surroundings clearly.

“Could it be... over already?” Guan Yu muttered to himself incredulously.

With the poison dissipated, an eerie silence fell. The only change was the ring of felled trees surrounding them, severed by Second to Wolf's sword energies.

Surveying the area, Guan Yu found no trace of the Four Venomous Evils. Evidently, they had fled - likely due to Fourth Brother's gunshot wound crippling their combat effectiveness. Knowing they stood no chance against Guan Yu and Second to Wolf combined, escape became their only option.

The blood mist around Second to Wolf gradually dissipated, revealing his form. Surveying the destruction he'd wrought, he declared with dark satisfaction, “It's been too long since I've fought seriously. Truly exhilarating.”

Within a fifty-meter radius, every tree lay felled by his sword energies. Above one meter from the ground, nothing remained save scattered leaves drifting slowly downward.

Guan Yu realized Second to Wolf had unleashed his ultimate technique. The phenomenon of physical dissolution into mist was something Guan Yu had never witnessed before - utterly marvelous. He resolved to seek instruction from Second to Wolf regarding this skill when time permitted.

“Those two shots of yours were brilliant,” Second to Wolf praised, nodding approvingly. “In the heat of battle, you maintained such situational awareness to pinpoint their hidden positions. Impressive.”

Guan Yu grumbled, “I never got to act before they fled. You claimed all the glory, yet still mock me.”

“Damn it! Couldn't you see I was fighting for my life? Who'd have thought a couple random shots from you would scare them off? This is utterly frustrating,” Second to Wolf complained bitterly.

With an amused smile, Guan Yu countered, “I used strategy, you used brute force. We both contributed, though your methods were more... visually spectacular. Practical effects aside.”

“Enough. The enemy's retreated and we're safe. All I ask is that you and Sakurako leave promptly. Remaining near me is too dangerous,” Second to Wolf stated gravely.

“Those four seemed formidable, but fled so easily? Not nearly as fearsome as rumored,” Guan Yu questioned.

Leaping across the river with Guan Yu, Second to Wolf explained, “Their true strength lies in combined efforts. Being quadruplets, their teamwork surpasses normal coordination. Together, they could overwhelm even a First-Class Venerable.

Chapter 2417: Clash of Titans (Part 2)

Legends claim they've slain Realm Venerables, though such tales' veracity remains unknown. Meeting them today... their performance matched your impression - far weaker than reputed.

Moreover, your shot crippled Fourth Brother, their hidden weapons expert. With their core member severely wounded, retreat became inevitable.”

“They likely never imagined I retained two bullets. Had they known, they wouldn't have been so careless,” Guan Yu mused.

“True. Even I was surprised. After expending my rounds, I discarded my pistol. When I saw you holster yours, I assumed sentimental attachment. Never guessed you kept two rounds reserved. Your foresight is remarkable,” Second to Wolf admitted.

Guan Yu found this persistent praise uncharacteristic of Second to Wolf's normally arrogant demeanor.

As Sakurako approached with Lan Yu and A'cai, she anxiously asked, “Guan Yu! Brother! Are you both unharmed?”

“Of course,” Second to Wolf chuckled. “With experts like us, what enemy could prevail?”

Guan Yu turned the concern around: “What about you all? Our greatest worry was your safety.”

“Since everyone's fine, let's leave quickly. This place still frightens me,” Lan Yu pleaded, clutching Guan Yu's arm.

Though the women hadn't witnessed the poison mist confrontation, the earlier gunfight left Lan Yu deeply shaken.

“Agreed. We should depart,” Guan Yu nodded.

After brief consideration, Second to Wolf led them roadside. “Crossing this road leads to my other property at West Lunliu Avenue. If undiscovered, it should be temporarily safe.”

Realization dawned on Guan Yu. “You own multiple safehouses to evade vengeful foes? Given your nation's limited territory, hiding spots must be scarce. Why not take Sakurako to China?”

Second to Wolf shook his head. “My pursuers possess formidable resources. They'd track me anywhere - even the moon. While China might complicate their search, Sakurako's condition prevents that option. Her constant longing for you would only intensify there, becoming unbearable when unable to meet.

Thus, we maintain numerous properties. When discovered at one, we relocate to another. This nomadic existence has become our normal.”

Guan Yu nodded silently. Unencumbered, Second to Wolf could roam freely. But Sakurako's presence tethered him, forcing constant vigilance about her safety - hence his urgency for Guan Yu to take her away.

With enemies multiplying, Sakurako's peril increased daily, compelling Second to Wolf's insistence on reuniting her with Guan Yu.

Lan Yu remained pale-faced, clinging to Guan Yu's arm. Sakurako appeared calmer, perhaps accustomed to such dangers. But Lan Yu trembled from her first experience of live combat - where a single bullet could prove fatal.

Her legs weakened until she stumbled, saved from falling only by Guan Yu's quick grasp.

“Lan Yu! Are you hurt?” Guan Yu asked urgently.

“Just... frightened,” she whispered. With no alternative, Guan Yu lifted her bridal-style. “You're safe with me.”

As they proceeded, Sakurako showed no jealousy. She wasn't petty-minded - even if Lan Yu were a stranger needing aid, she'd approve of Guan Yu's assistance.

“Wait here while I scout ahead,” Second to Wolf instructed. Returning shortly, he waved them forward. Guan Yu carried the now-slumbering Lan Yu, her terror having exhausted her.

Chapter 2418: Regulations

The new residence's dust had been hastily swept. “This place hasn't been inhabited for ages. Make yourselves comfortable despite the grime,” Second to Wolf offered.

After gently laying Lan Yu on a sofa, Guan Yu warned, “We can't linger. The enemy will strike again while momentum favors them.”

“Agreed. You must take Sakurako to China immediately. She'll be far safer there,” Second to Wolf urged.

“There should be flights tonight. Let's depart this evening,” Guan Yu proposed. “You and A'cai could go anywhere - but Qiaoyuan District remains your home whenever desired.”

Moved, Second to Wolf replied, “Your care for Sakurako is all I ask. Once she's gone, no vendetta will concern me. A'cai and I may wander freely - hunters will find tracking us difficult.”

Guan Yu understood completely. Sakurako had been her brother's burden despite their profound bond. Only escalating dangers forced this separation.

Nodding, Guan Yu vowed, “Entrusting Sakurako to me means trusting my care. I never mistreat those close to me.” He then called Yang Conghan: “Check tonight's Japan-China flights. Three tickets. Secure the earliest available.”

Hanging up, he told Second to Wolf, “Should you ever need shelter in China, I'll arrange accommodations near Qiaoyuan District.”

Second to Wolf expressed gratitude, having already considered post-Sakurako plans: secluding himself with A'cai to breakthrough to First-Class Venerable Upper Rank, however long that might take.

Unmentioned was Qiaoyuan's unwritten rule - established by Xu Jinglei to prevent romantic entanglements among Guan Yu's numerous beauties - forbidding male overnight stays except Guan Yu himself. Even visiting relatives like Aunt Lü's Uncle Wang departed after brief visits. The women maintained this discipline scrupulously.

“If you ever seek Chinese residence, notify me immediately,” Guan Yu pressed. “I can arrange multiple safehouses.”

“Urban China doesn't suit me,” Second to Wolf admitted. “Crowded cities offer poor hiding. I'd prefer rural areas permitting multiple escape routes if besieged. Urban apartments become death traps when enemies blockade exits.”

“Regardless, remember my offer. My influence guarantees assistance,” Guan Yu insisted.

With genuine appreciation, Second to Wolf nodded. “I'll remember. But presently, I plan secluded cultivation with A'cai's support. Breaking through to Upper Rank may take years... perhaps decades. Only then might I consider Chinese residence.”

“Cultivation matters, but stay vigilant,” Guan Yu cautioned. “Those attackers were clearly backed by powerful patrons. Exercise extreme caution.”

Second to Wolf laughed dismissively. “This is routine for me. Why doubt my capabilities?”

Sakurako, recalling the battle's intensity, worried anew. Though accustomed to frequent attacks, today's scale surpassed previous encounters. Each new enemy cohort grew stronger than the last.

“Brother, please come to China with us,” she implored. “Guan Yu can protect you there.”

“Impossible,” he refused gently. “I won't endanger you both. China's constraints would suffocate me. My safety isn't your concern - freedom remains my best defense.”

He left unspoken the deeper truth: with Sakurako secure, he could finally unleash his full power without restraint. The true Second to Wolf, unfettered by familial concerns, would become a storm none dared challenge.
