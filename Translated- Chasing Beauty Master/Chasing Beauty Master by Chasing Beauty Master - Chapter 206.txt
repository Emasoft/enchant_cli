“Alright, your Manchu-Han Imperial Feast has arrived. Seeing your current state, you clearly can’t feed yourself. Let me assist.” Guan Yu flashed his pearly white teeth again, but Gao Wei sensed no warmth—only a predatory gleam, like a beast baring fangs.

Pushing the dining cart toward Feng Minglun, Guan Yu noted the man had marginally recovered, no longer coughing up fluids, though nausea still gripped him.

When Feng Minglun saw Guan Yu leaning down with that smile, his expression stiffened. Instinct drove him to rise, but a massive foot met his face, slamming his skull against the floor with dizzying force.

“So many dishes here. Care to pick one first?” Guan Yu gestured to the cart.

Feng Minglun glanced at the exquisite spread—visually stunning, aromatically rich—yet it stirred no appetite. He remained silent, baffled by Guan Yu’s motives.

“No choice? I’ll choose for you.” Guan Yu rummaged beneath the cart and produced a bowl of soup. “Jade Pearl Broth. Perfect to soothe your stomach.”

“Open wide,” Guan Yu urged cheerfully.

Realization dawned on Feng Minglun. This “imperial feast” wasn’t about indulgence—it was about force-feeding him the entire cart’s contents. The thought of his stomach rupturing from such gluttony horrified him. He clamped his lips shut.

But fate, like rivers flowing to sea, cares not for mortal wills.

“Won’t open? Then I’ll help.”

Guan Yu’s foot slammed into Feng Minglun’s chest. Agony arched the man’s body, jaws springing open involuntarily. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu poured the scalding broth down his throat.

The execution proved imperfect—some liquid spilled—but most found its mark. Feng Minglun’s world dissolved into searing torment as sixty-degree heat scorched his esophagus, making Guan Yu’s earlier kick feel heavenly by comparison.

He’d rather endure gangland torture than this culinary hell—and this was merely the appetizer. The cart remained laden.

“How’s the flavor?” Guan Yu mused at Feng Minglun’s silence. “No complaints? Splendid. Next course.”

By the fifth dish, Feng Minglun lost consciousness. Guan Yu tsked, “Pathetic. Barely started and already broken.”

His peripheral glance caught Li Dayong cowering in shadows, phone pressed to ear. The lackey was summoning reinforcements—undoubtedly underworld types, given Officer Bai Jie’s useless police report.

Li Dayong shuddered under Guan Yu’s icy stare, nearly dropping his phone. He’d dialed a triad boss allied with Feng Minglun, too terrified to intervene directly yet unable to watch his superior’s humiliation.

**Chapter 512: Dual-Purpose Retribution**

Feng Minglun awoke to Guan Yu’s boot—a rude revival he’d have avoided given choice. The man looming above was pure demon, devising tortures beyond sane imagination.

His stomach convulsed, bile rising. Chest burned from repeated stomps whenever he resisted opening his mouth. Countless kicks? Lost track. His face crusted with half-digested sludge expelled through gastric trauma.

Death seemed blissful.

Meeting Guan Yu’s faintly smiling eyes, Feng Minglun tasted primal fear—and venomous hatred. He’d make this bastard pay in blood. And that bitch Gao Wei too—this nightmare traced to her.

*Whore*, he seethed inwardly.

The murderous glint didn’t escape Guan Yu. Leaning close despite the filth, he purred, “Enjoying yourself?”

Feng Minglun stayed mute—not from defiance, but exhaustion. Every ounce of strength went to retching. Better silence than provoking more “courses.”

Unbeknownst to him, he’d already crossed Guan Yu’s red line.

“Silence means delight. Don’t worry—we’ve all night to play.”

Guan Yu selected another dish. Feng Minglun blanched at the braised pork ribs—each chunk dumpling-sized. Choking hazards incarnate.

Death’s proximity shattered composure. He thrashed wildly until a brutal kick sapped his strength, leaving him wheezing blood.

“This...is murder!” he rasped.

“Murder?” Guan Yu chuckled. “I won’t let you die.” His healing abilities guaranteed that. “Just sharing culinary delights. You seem...enthusiastic.”

“Enthusiastic my ass!” Feng Minglun spat. When had he ever consented?

Guan Yu’s gaze turned glacial. Killing intent pinned Feng Minglun like a specimen. For one heart-stopping moment, the man felt himself a corpse.

Returning to reality drenched in cold sweat, he gasped as Guan Yu declared, “You’ll pay for that.”

Another rib-cracking stomp pried his jaws.

Feng Minglun’s eyes rolled back. Hadn’t he paid enough? Little did he know he’d triggered Guan Yu’s ultimate taboo.

Three kicks failed to open the clamped mouth. “Stubborn,” Guan Yu sneered, wrenching the jaw downward with a sickening *crack*.

Li Dayong finally intervened. “Stop! My contacts are coming—triad enforcers! You’ll regret this!”

Guan Yu’s grin widened. “Disappointed? I’ve been waiting for them.” The rib cascade poured into Feng Minglun’s dislocated maw.

Choking convulsions followed. Li Dayong recoiled, terror-struck by the young man’s ruthlessness.

Gao Wei approached anxiously. “Guan Yu! This could kill him!”

“Remember my medical skills?” he winked. “Death’s not an option. Call it...dual-purpose discipline.”

Her cheeks flushed at the innuendo. “Shameless lech!”

Meanwhile, Feng Minglun writhed, ribs lodged in his windpipe. Guan Yu finally hoisted him by the collar, delivering a palm-strike and spinning kick that launched both man and blockage through the doorway.

As Feng Minglun projectile-vomited, the restaurant doors burst open.

**Chapter 514: Snowbound Stroll**

Guan Yu and Gao Wei departed the private club, leaving Liu Jun to handle aftermath. Xu Feng discreetly avoided interrupting their moonlit exit—as did Bai Jie, who trailed them outside.

“Wait!” The star called out, demeanor subdued. “I...yield. You protect her better than I ever could.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Why quit now?”

“Today proved it.” Bai Jie gestured limply. “When thugs threatened her, I froze. You acted. She needs that. And...” He swallowed. “She loves you, not me.”

As the actor retreated, Guan Yu remarked, “Interesting chap.”

“Good riddance,” Gao Wei breathed, then blinked as snowflakes kissed her cheeks.

“Stroll?” Guan Yu offered.

They wandered through the whitening park, his jacket around her shoulders. Silent understanding bloomed between crunching footsteps.

“Cold?” he asked.

She shook her head but snuggled deeper into the coat. Lanterns cast golden halos on fresh powder, ice glinting beneath the lake’s glass skin.

“Thank you,” she murmured later.

“For the coat? I’m—”

“For everything.”

He grinned. “What are pretend-husbands for?”

Her elbow found his ribs, but laughter followed. Snow swirled around them—two figures dissolving into winter’s embrace.
