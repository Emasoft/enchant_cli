Standing beside him was a diminutive man of about five feet in height, gaunt and frail in appearance. Though his temples bore streaks of gray and his stubble showed signs of whitening, suggesting an age of at least sixty years, this small-statured man wore a peaked cap pulled low over his brow, obscuring his features from view. Despite his elderly appearance, he exuded an aura of authority that commanded instinctive fear from those around him.

When Bill Lin posed his question, the old man responded in flawless Western tongue: "Ordinary practitioners could never achieve such mastery. To project inner qi to this extent requires at least the Realm Sovereign level. Yet this woman... I cannot be certain without witnessing it firsthand."

Near the doorway stood a rotund figure whom Guan Yu would immediately recognize—the portly peace officer. To everyone's surprise, this man was revealed to be part of the Feng Family.

Bill Lin berated the quivering officer: "You were supposed to capture Guan Yu! Instead, you let a murderer escape right under your nose! Do you know what 'incompetent' means?"

"B-Bill-sama," the officer stammered, sweat beading on his forehead, "he had a gun! That mad look in his eyes—I swear he would've shot me!"

"Useless swine!" Bill Lin roared, slamming his fist on the table. "The Feng Family might as well employ pigs for all the good you do!"

After his tirade, Bill Lin demanded: "Describe exactly what you felt when that girl beside Guan Yu unleashed her qi."

The officer trembled as he recalled: "Sudden gales—terrible winds that knocked people off their feet. And cold... such piercing cold it could freeze a man's bones in moments. Had it lasted longer..."

The wizened old man stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Cryogenic qi? Rare indeed. Her cultivation defies categorization—Realm Sovereign power manifesting through unorthodox means."

"Can you gauge her true strength?" Bill Lin pressed.

"Impossible," came the curt reply. "Her frost qi suggests Realm Sovereign mastery, yet her control lacks refinement. A paradox."

As the discussion grew heated, Ge Yinglai interjected: "Arguing solves nothing. Our surveillance showed Guan Yu escaping to the Yang Family's private clinic. What happened after?"

The officer paled. "Their guards barred entry! When Yang Conghan herself appeared, my reinforcements fled like frightened rabbits! I barely escaped their enforcers!"

Bill Lin's face flushed crimson with rage. "You spineless—"

"Enough." Young Master Feng descended the staircase, his calm voice cutting through the tension. "Guan Yu is no ordinary prey. Provoke him recklessly, and you'll reap whirlwinds beyond your control." His warning delivered, he retired upstairs, leaving the conspirators to their scheming.

Chapter 2624: Sound Reasoning

"The Yang auction approaches," Sun Xu suggested. "Our best chance to strike."

Ge Yinglai shook his head. "Guan Yu anticipates this. The clinic becomes his fortress—none dare breach Yang territory."

Bill Lin's eyes narrowed at their elderly advisor nicknamed "The Rat." This venerable cultivator represented the Bill Family's hidden strength—too valuable to risk lightly. "We bide our time. Let Guan Yu make the first move."

"But delay grants him advantage!" Ge protested. "He'll—"

"—Expect our attack," Bill Lin finished. "Therefore, we prepare welcoming gifts. Let him walk into our web."

Dawn found Xue Jing awakening to find Guan Yu keeping vigil by Shuangshuang's bedside. Though pale, the injured girl managed a weak smile. "The doctors call my survival miraculous. Thank you, Elder Sister Jing."

Xue Jing's throat tightened. "You took that blade for me. This debt can never be repaid."

Guan Yu gestured to steaming congee. "Eat. You've burned through your qi reserves." His eyes softened watching Xue Jing's reluctant compliance, knowing her stoic facade masked deep concern.

As sunlight filtered through clinic windows, Yang Conghan entered with fresh bandages. "The assassins bore Feng Family marks," she stated without preamble. "Their game escalates."

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. "Let them come. This ends at the auction." His hand rested briefly on Shuangshuang's—cold, but steadily warming. Xue Jing observed the gesture, her frost qi still circulating through the patient's meridians.

In that moment, three resolve hardened—a trinity forged through fire and ice, ready to weather the gathering storm.
