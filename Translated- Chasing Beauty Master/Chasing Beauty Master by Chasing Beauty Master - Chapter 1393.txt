“What does it matter if they’re wasted?” Elder Jiu still appeared reluctant as he said, “Since ancient times, no person of capability has ever passed down all their knowledge to descendants. Later generations could never fully inherit their ancestors’ wisdom, for secrets were always withheld. Thus, each generation grows weaker than the last. Countless advanced spells and cultivation techniques were buried with their creators. I merely preserve the books I’ve collected—is there anything wrong with that?”

With Elder Jiu’s stance, Guan Yu found no way to argue. It seemed entry to the study would not be permitted. Guan Yu resolved to rely on his own methods.

That night, as silence enveloped the mountains, Guan Yu sat idly in his room before sneaking out. Uncertain of Elder Jiu’s true capabilities, he wondered if breaking into the locked study would trigger detection.

Yet curiosity overwhelmed caution. The simple lock proved mere decoration under Guan Yu’s skilled hands. Retrieving a gold leaf—a gift from Chief Lu—he hammered it into a key shape. These crude locks posed little challenge to one of his talents.

Confident in his makeshift key, Guan Yu crept toward the study under moonlight. As he approached the door, his fingers brushed an ancient bronze padlock. The moment he touched it, arcane energies flared.

“A magical seal?” Guan Yu muttered in frustration. He had anticipated a simple mechanism, not a spellbound guardian. The unexpected defense left him stymied.

Uncertain of the enchantment’s nature, he dared not proceed recklessly. If the spell connected to Elder Jiu’s awareness, any tampering might alert the old master. Given Elder Jiu’s notorious protectiveness of his sanctum, discovery promised severe consequences.

Trapped before the sealed portal, Guan Yu glared at the glowing lock. After exhaustive mental calculations yielded no solution, he retreated empty-handed.

The mystical barrier proved insurmountable. Guan Yu’s limited understanding of spellcraft left him helpless. If the enchantment served as both lock and alarm, the study remained impregnable.

Returning to his quarters, Guan Yu pondered alternative routes. Perhaps rooftop entry? Though removing tiles might create noise, careful movement could avoid detection. Surely Elder Jiu hadn’t warded every surface?

Lacking ropes for safe descent, Guan Yu abandoned the plan. Even using qinggong to leap down risked audible landings. Defeated again, he slumped onto his stool, mind racing for solutions.

Dawn found Guan Yu unusually early at the main hall. Today’s mission: convince Elder Jiu to teach him seal-breaking techniques. Normally accompanied by Xiao Dong, the space held only the elderly master today.

“Good morning, Elder Jiu,” Guan Yu greeted. The master merely nodded, eyes half-closed in drowsy indifference. Guan Yu pressed, “Where’s Xiao Dong?”

“Sent him down the mountain for supplies,” Elder Jiu murmured without opening his eyes. “Our stores needed replenishing.”

“What? Had I known, I’d have accompanied him! I know the lower villages well—” Guan Yu’s eager offer died as Elder Jiu raised a hand.

“Unnecessary. He’s made this trip often. State your true purpose.”

Guan Yu grinned, sliding beside the elder. “Your wisdom shines through! Indeed, I seek guidance.” He launched into elaborate flattery comparing Elder Jiu to Zhuge Liang, only to stumble when met with blank confusion.

“Zhuge Kongming was a legendary strategist from my homeland,” Guan Yu explained, detailing the ancient tactician’s marvels. “To call someone ‘Zhuge’ is our highest praise for wisdom.”

Elder Jiu’s eyebrows rose. “Interesting. This Zhuge’s realm—I’ve visited similar lands.”

“You’ve been to my world?!” Guan Yu gaped.

“Twenty years past,” the elder nodded. “Chasing a demonic entity through dimensional rifts. Your world’s towering buildings, horseless carriages—‘cars,’ you call them—were... memorable.”

As Elder Jiu recounted battling the跨界恶魔, Guan Yu’s astonishment grew. The tale of lost comrades and accidental dimensional travel unfolded—a revelation that their worlds occupied separate planes of existence.

“Impossible!” Guan Yu protested. “I journeyed here conventionally!”

“Conventional paths sometimes cross dimensions,” Elder Jiu countered. “Your route forms a stable bridge between realms. Those unaware walk past Cloudgreen Sect’s mountains seeing only wilderness.”

The implications stunned Guan Yu. If true, his entire understanding of geography collapsed. Even as Elder Jiu described technological marvels from twenty years prior, Guan Yu’s mind raced—what if the missing junior brother still wandered modern streets?

“Could your lost companion be trapped in my world?” Guan Yu ventured.

Elder Jiu’s face clouded. “Perhaps. Without the portal path...” He sighed. “Enough reminiscing. State your actual request.”

Guan Yu leaned forward. “Teach me to break magical seals. Last night’s... academic curiosity remains unsatisfied.”

A knowing glint flashed in the elder’s eyes. “So the lock held? Good. Let’s discuss tuition...”
