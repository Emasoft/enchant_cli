Ling Su had already gained considerable knowledge about the Ha Clan, yet remained uncertain whether the legendary manual truly existed. If it did, he fervently desired to obtain it.

Moreover, the Jia Sect appeared deeply interested in this manual. Strengthening their forces by seizing the Ha Clan's mysterious text seemed their best strategy. Once acquired, the secrets of the Ha Clan's mighty warriors would surely unravel.

Ling Su probed cautiously, "The Jia Sect acts so brazenly, committing endless atrocities. Yet the Ha Clan, with all its might, hasn't launched a full assault to eradicate them? Eliminating the sect entirely would crush their ambitions toward your manual. Despair proves the most effective deterrent."

"Though our Ha Clan is strong," Hada Bei explained, "our power has limits. Destroying the Jia Sect isn't simple—they're no pushovers. Their greatest advantage lies in numbers. As the saying goes, 'Even a mighty tiger struggles against a pack of wolves.' When they deploy human-wave tactics, our smaller forces cannot endure."

"If left unchecked," Ling Su countered, "the Jia Sect's obsession with your manual will persist endlessly. They'll scheme ceaselessly to obtain it, bringing perpetual trouble."

"There's no need for concern," Ma Zhagen interjected. "Our Ha Clan isn't easily crushed. Even if the Jia Sect attacks, the desert's harsh environment favors defenders. Whoever initiates an offensive becomes the disadvantaged party."

"Exactly," Hada Bei affirmed. "In desert warfare, attackers suffer natural disadvantages. If the Jia Sect assaults us, we defenders hold the advantage—they'd battle both our forces and the elements. Conversely, if we besiege their stronghold, breaching their defenses becomes nearly impossible."

**Chapter 4499: A Discovery**

Guan Yu had risen early, his gaze fixed on the distant black pillar still visible on the horizon. Its persistent presence disproved one theory—this was no mirage, but a tangible structure.

Determined to investigate, Guan Yu led his party forward. With Ling Su gone, the atmosphere lightened considerably. Siqi clung to Guan Yu's side, her camel keeping pace with his as she chattered amiably.

By midday, they reached the pillar's vicinity. The landscape here differed markedly—thicker vegetation sprouted across the dunes, allowing camels to graze as they walked.

"Look there!" Wang Jun pointed ahead.

The black pillar loomed hundreds of meters away, surrounded by clusters of yurts at its base. Guan Yu initially suspected rival factions might be camped there, but the scale suggested permanent settlement.

"Could people actually live here?" Guan Yu asked Siqi.

"Quite possible," she replied. "Desert dwellers aren't uncommon."

"If true," Aze interjected, "we could replenish our water. Those reserves would greatly aid our journey."

As they approached, figures emerged from the pillar's base. Guan Yu realized the structure itself housed inhabitants. Its imposing height hinted at purposes beyond mere shelter.

"Let's advance and rest there," Guan Yu decided. The group moved toward the nearest yurt, unaware that watchmen atop the black pillar—called Wooden Towers by the Ha Clan—had already spotted them.

**Chapter 4500: The Confrontation**

With the clan chief absent, Ma Zhagen—the chief's son and mightiest warrior—received the visitors' report. He and Hada Bei had been drinking with Ling Su since morning, all three now thoroughly intoxicated yet coherent.

Ling Su's muddled mind recalled Guan Yu's threat: no mercy if they met again in the desert. Yet emboldened by alcohol and the Ha Clan's protection, he chose confrontation over hiding.

"Seems my pursuers arrived," Ling Su slurred, lifting his heavy head. "Timing matches expectations."

"Stay calm, brother," Ma Zhagen assured. "Even the Jia Sect wouldn't dare harass us. We'll send them packing."

As the Ha leaders staggered out to confront the newcomers, Guan Yu dismounted, astonished by the approaching giants. Ma Zhagen towered over him like a human grizzly, while Hada Bei's bronze musculature radiated raw power.

"Who are you?" Ma Zhagen demanded brusquely. "The Ha Clan welcomes no outsiders."

Guan Yu noted their alcoholic breath. "We're desert travelers, merely curious about this place."

"Leave immediately," came the dismissal.

As Guan Yu turned to depart, Aze spotted Ling Su emerging from a yurt. The traitorous disciple swaggered forward, flanked by his intoxicated protectors.

"So we meet again," Ling Su taunted. "Under my brothers' protection, what can you do now?"

Guan Yu's voice turned glacial. "I warned you—every desert encounter ends in your punishment. Have you forgotten?"

To the gathering crowd, he declared, "Ling Su! As a Cloud Azure Sect elder's direct disciple, how dare you carouse with outsiders? When our master learns of this..."

"Enough!" Ling Su interrupted. "My status isn't your concern. These are my new brothers—what business is that of yours?"

Guan Yu's hand moved toward his weapon. "Today, I'll purge our sect's disgrace."

**Chapter 4501: Unresolved Tensions**

Ma Zhagen and Hada Bei exchanged glances, reassessing the situation. This wasn't mere external enmity—it involved internal sect discipline. Yet alcohol-fueled loyalty bound them to Ling Su.

"Touch him," Hada Bei growled, "and you go through us first."

Ling Su, despite his swimming head, seized the moment. "See how you're outmatched? Leave while you can."

Guan Yu's gaze swept the muscular entourage. Direct combat against these human titans seemed futile. Yet allowing Ling Su's betrayal to stand was equally unacceptable.

"The Cloud Azure Sect will investigate this thoroughly," Guan Yu vowed. "Your alliance with desert clans won't shield you forever."

As tensions crackled like desert lightning, both sides recognized this confrontation remained unresolved—a temporary stalemate dictated by terrain and intoxication rather than true resolution. The desert winds carried promises of future reckonings.
