“Bad news! This creature’s blood is poisonous! Everyone be careful—cover your mouths if possible!” Second to Wolf shouted urgently as he assessed the situation.

Guan Yu grew increasingly certain this creature was connected to the legend of the Sacred Tree. Upon reflection, the monster must have been lurking atop the tree all along—how else could it have suddenly appeared behind him?

The village entrance sprawled wide. While Second to Wolf’s ability to traverse the distance in a single breath spoke to his extraordinary speed, this lumbering beast clearly lacked such swiftness. It could only have been hiding within the Sacred Tree’s branches—or perhaps it was the tree’s resident guardian all along.

“No need for excessive caution,” Guan Yu remarked. “Though its green blood may carry toxins, as long as we avoid direct contact, we won’t be poisoned.”

The monster, now missing a claw from Second to Wolf’s strike, writhed and groaned in the distance. Guan Yu added, “Harsh, don’t you think? You struck rather mercilessly.”

“Beasts that prey on innocents deserve no mercy,” Second to Wolf retorted, already darting forward. In a blur, he crossed ten meters, his blade flashing crimson. The creature’s agonized howls echoed as limbs fell. By the time Second to Wolf returned to cleanse his toxin-streaked blade in the stream, the fight had ended.

The monster now lay mutilated—legs and remaining claws severed, utterly helpless. Guan Yu glanced at the village chief’s ashen face. Second to Wolf had deliberately spared the creature’s life, leaving it barely conscious for interrogation.

The chief trembled like a man mourning his son, muscles twitching in anguish.

“It should revert to its original form once the poisoned blood drains,” Second to Wolf predicted, approaching. Guan Yu withheld his suspicions, waiting to gather the villagers before revealing the truth.

The chief glared venomously at Second to Wolf. “You! I banished you, yet you return to desecrate our Sacred Tree! Seize him!” His command rallied the crowd, but none moved against the man who’d subdued the monster.

Guan Yu turned with a cold smile. “Attempting to silence witnesses, old man? Shouldn’t you bid farewell to your ‘precious son’ instead?”

The chief froze. How could this outsider know?

“Lies!” the chief roared, his staff erupting in radiant white light—a revelation of his Second-Class Revered realm cultivation. He lunged, only for Second to Wolf to intercept him, disarming the elder with a single kick.

“Another move,” the warrior warned, “and consequences will follow.”

As the chief collapsed in despair, Guan Yu pressed: “Explain this monstrosity.” The crowd murmured, torn between doubt and growing realization.

Lin Qiaoqiao edged closer. “Guan Yu… you mean that creature is… his son?”

“Precisely,” Guan Yu confirmed. “The chief has long concealed this truth.”

Chaos erupted. Villagers recalled the chief’s son supposedly devoured by a monster months prior. Yet as the beast’s form shimmered—black fur retracting, bestial features melting into human visage—a gasping middle-aged man emerged.

“It’s him!” someone cried. “The chief’s son!”

The transformed man rasped a final plea: “Father… confess…” before expiring.

**Chapter 3091: The Monster Emerges (Conclusion)**

Amid the chief’s wails, the truth unraveled. For generations, their lineage had borne a curse tied to the Sacred Tree. A century prior, an injured stranger sought refuge, only to transform into a bloodthirsty beast upon the birth of the chief’s ancestor. The cycle repeated—each generation’s firstborn morphing into a monster sustained by blood, hidden by shame.

“We… we had no choice!” the chief sobbed. “The Sacred Tree’s legend… our ancestors’ pact…”

Guan Yu understood now—the tree served as both prison and sanctuary. The chief’s son, driven by primal hunger, had escalated from livestock to humans. When Guan Yu challenged the chief earlier, the son—still cognizant in monster form—had attacked in paternal defense.

As villagers processed this, Second to Wolf observed: “The poisoned blood warped his body. Its purge returned his humanity… briefly.”

Lin Qiaoqiao’s uncle stepped forward. “Chief, explain properly. We deserve that much.”

Between ragged breaths, the elder recounted their ancestral burden—a lineage of cultivators bound to guard the Sacred Tree, their firstborns sacrificed to contain an ancient evil sealed within. The tree’s spiritual energy had long suppressed the curse, but recent weakening allowed the transformation.

Guan Yu pieced together the cultivation aspects—the chief’s extended lifespan, his spiritual staff. This was no mere village drama but a collision of mortal struggles and immortal pacts. As dawn approached, the crowd grappled with revelations that blurred the lines between protector and monster, duty and damnation.

The warrior and cultivator exchanged glances. Some battles required blades; others demanded truths long buried.
