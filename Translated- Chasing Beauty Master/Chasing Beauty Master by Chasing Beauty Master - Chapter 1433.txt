“There’s still time before the fifteenth of July, so there’s no rush. Though finding Miaocheng in the desert won’t be easy, I doubt it’ll stump us. The main issue now is that I’m feeling unwell and need to rest here for a few days,” Yan Zhao said.

Xiao Zhi nodded. If Yan Zhao was unwell, rest was necessary. Guan Yu, too, intended to stay and wait for Wang Xiaorong. He wondered if she had managed to persuade the Demon Lord to let her leave again after returning.

After breakfast, Xiao Zhi suggested, “Senior Brother, since you’re unwell, let me escort you back to your room to rest.”

“Ah, yes! That would be most kind,” Yan Zhao replied with an inward sneer.

Guan Yu had matters to attend to and decided to explore the area. Xiao Zhi accompanied Yan Zhao to the inn. Though Yan Zhao hadn’t planned to let Xiao Zhi follow, Guan Yu had already paid for another day’s lodging. Without this, Yan Zhao would have had nowhere to stay. *Xiao Zhi has always lived under Elder Zheng’s watchful eye. Now that he’s out on a mission, he must be carrying plenty of silver*, Yan Zhao thought.

**Chapter 3728: Arrested**

On the way back, Yan Zhao feigned distress. “What rotten luck! Last night, I got drunk and lost my money pouch. Utterly cursed!”

“Oh?” Xiao Zhi eyed him skeptically, recalling Yan Zhao’s state the previous night. “Senior Brother, where *did* you drink last night? You didn’t return until dawn.”

“Hmm… Some tavern… I can’t recall the name. Drank until I blacked out. Still have a headache,” Yan Zhao mumbled vaguely.

Xiao Zhi assumed Yan Zhao had simply gotten drunk and caused a scene, oblivious to his own actions. *Poor soul—losing his money and dignity.*

“Oh no!” Yan Zhao suddenly halted. “My pouch is gone, and I only paid for one day at the inn. I’ll end up sleeping on the streets! Guan Yu would never lend me a coin.”

Xiao Zhi couldn’t let his senior brother suffer. “Don’t worry. Take my silver—no need to repay.” He handed Yan Zhao two silver ingots.

Yan Zhao’s eyes lit greedily. *This is enough for plenty of fun!* He snatched the ingots. “Xiao Zhi, you’re a lifesaver! I left the sect with barely enough silver, and now even that’s gone. Without you, I’d starve!”

“Think nothing of it. You’ve helped me countless times in the sect.”

“I’ll repay you double when we return!”

“No need, Senior Brother. We’re family.”

Yan Zhao smirked inwardly. *Who knew this fool would be so useful? Money truly makes heroes kneel.*

At the inn, the staff had changed shifts. Yan Zhao swaggered in, eager to flaunt his new wealth, but the familiar face was gone.

“Where’s yesterday’s attendant?” he demanded.

“We rotate shifts every other day. How may I assist you?” the new attendant replied.

“A third-class room for one day. Any discounts for longer stays?”

“A week’s stay grants a 5% discount and membership.”

“No, just one day.”

Yan Zhao secured the same room and dismissed Xiao Zhi. Lying in bed, he recalled his secret mission. Before leaving the sect, Elder Xuanming had privately tasked him with obtaining the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. He’d been given a centuries-old peachwood talisman capable of detecting and absorbing demonic energy.

*If I use this to drain Guan Yu’s Eight-Sided Drum Technique—inherited from the demonic Meng Hua Patriarch—my power will soar. Even the Left Envoy of the Demonic Soul Sect won’t rival me. I’ll cleanse my blood curse, shake off the sect’s control, and reclaim my status as Yunqing Sect’s top disciple. Wealth and women will follow!*

Buoyed by ambition, Yan Zhao’s headache vanished. He sought Xiao Zhi to probe Guan Yu’s whereabouts.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu wandered the streets, unaccustomed to Wang Xiaorong’s absence. Suddenly, a troop of guards surrounded him.

**Chapter 3729: Clear the Path**

Constable Han emerged, smirking. “Nowhere to run now. Surrender quietly.”

Guan Yu frowned. “What’s the meaning of this?”

“You assaulted my men and murdered Magistrate Zhou of Taohua Town. You’re a wanted criminal.”

“You’re delusional. That death was from poison—nothing to do with me. Step aside.”

“Arrest him!”

Guan Yu incapacitated several guards and slipped into an alley. That evening, as he dined with Xiao Zhi, Yan Zhao knocked.

“Let’s eat! I found a superb noodle shop,” Yan Zhao urged.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Since when is *he* generous?”

“I lent him silver,” Xiao Zhi explained.

At the Yangchun Noodle Shop, Yan Zhao grew unusually quiet.

“Senior Brother, you still look ill,” Xiao Zhi noted.

“Just… fatigued,” Yan Zhao lied, hiding his plan to prolong their stay.

When Yan Zhao brought side dishes, Guan Yu ate without suspicion. By nightfall, he was stricken with violent diarrhea.

**Chapter 3730: Wanted**

“Was it the noodles?” Xiao Zhi asked the next morning.

Yan Zhao laughed. “Karma bites, eh? Here—take this pill. It cured my stomach.”

Wary, Guan Yu inspected the Yunqing Sect’s medicinal pellet. Detecting no poison, he swallowed it. Soon, searing heat and agony erupted—his demonic Eight-Sided Drum energy clashing with the pill’s purifying essence.

Yan Zhao’s trap had sprung.
