Wang Chao, flushed with humiliation, threw another fist whistling through the air, each strike effortlessly deflected by Guan Yu's calm movements.

To onlookers, it appeared the frail Guan Yu was being forced into retreat by Wang Chao's onslaught. But Wang Chao knew better – this unassuming opponent was far from simple! Though he seemed to drive Guan Yu backward with each blow, an unsettling sensation crept through him, as though something vital were draining from his body, slipping through his fingers like sand.

Another punch, this one fueled by desperation, arced downward. A faint smile curled Guan Yu's lips. Three moves. Checkmate.

In a blur, Guan Yu vanished before the crowd's astonished eyes.

"Invisibility Art? But that's a technique only Sixth-Rank Gold Warriors can master!..."

"Invisibility Art?..."

"Could it be...?"

As murmurs swirled, Guan Yu materialized again – directly behind Wang Chao. A commanding shout split the air: "Qiankun Palm!"

On the platform, Elder Altai brought his hands together in applause. This unremarkable youth had first drained his opponent's vital energy, then struck with a decisive blow during their moment of weakness! Devious... yet brilliant!

Caught off guard, Wang Chao was sent sprawling meters across the ground.

Guan Yu pressed forward with another Qiankun Palm. Though Wang Chao blocked it, the force behind this strike carried far deadlier intent. One more such blow would end him.

As Guan Yu's palm descended once more, Wang Chao closed his eyes in resignation. "I yield!"

The crowd erupted in shock. Huo Lingling stood dumbfounded. Though she'd trusted her brother's protection, never had she imagined Guan Yu's strength could overwhelm a Gold Warrior two ranks his superior! If Wang Chao's talent counted as first-rate, Guan Yu's was peerless! To think their family's greatest asset would be surrendered so easily – the injustice burned!

"This... this is..."

"What? Would the mighty Wang family renege on their vow?" Guan Yu's father interjected, voice trembling with suppressed triumph. "All of Wutanaris bears witness!"

"The Wang family honors its word!"

"Excellent! By dawn two days hence, we expect the Jade Gate flying the Lin banner!" With a flourish of sleeves, he departed.

The Wang clan's faces cycled through shades of black and green, a spectacle of chagrin.

......

"Guan Yu! Magnificent! You've brought glory to the Lin name!" Elder Altai thundered from the council hall's central seat, eyes alight. "Not only have you humiliated the Wangs who oppressed us for years, but claimed their Jade Gate – the very heart of their wealth!"

"Elder Altai flatters me." Guan Yu's reply carried detached calm, as though discussing another's deeds. "The Lin family is my home. I cannot abide its humiliation."

"You've hidden your depths well, boy! Even your own father remained oblivious!" Lin Hui chuckled, eyeing the youth by the hall entrance. "We underestimated you all these years. How much have you endured?"

"No hardships worth noting. My past self simply... failed to command attention."

"Ah, child..." Lin Hui nodded solemnly, leaving the unspoken hanging.

Guan Yu's maturity far exceeded his years – forged through countless days enduring the "trash" epithet, weathering storms in silence.

......

"Father, I've failed." The battered Wang Chao knelt trembling before his sire. Surrendering their primary revenue source to the rival clan – for his hot-tempered father Wang Shan, such loss was anathema.

"Worthless spawn! How dared you stake the Jade Gate?" Wang Shan's beard quivered with rage.

"I was certain of victory! Who could foresee..."

"That Guan Yu would defeat you?"

"He... he concealed his true power! Otherwise, Huo Lingling would be your daughter-in-law now!" Wang Chao wrung his hands, eyes glinting obsessively.

"You... lust-blinded fool! Crushed yet still dreaming of women? You'll die in some harlot's embrace!" Wang Shan shook with apoplectic fury. "You'll be the ruin of House Wang!"

Head bowed, Wang Chao ventured: "Must we truly surrender the Jade Gate?"

After heavy silence, Wang Shan growled: "Let them claim our treasure? Not without cost! Order every jade fragment burned within the day. Let them keep worthless ashes!"

"Yes, Father!"

Dark clouds swallowed the moon, plunging the world into gloom.

......

"Brother Guan Yu! Rise! The sun scorches your bed!"

"Brother Guan Yu, awaken!"

"Brother! Elder Altai summons you! Uncle Lin Hui grows impatient!"

Dawn found Guan Yu prizing open sleep-crusted eyes to Huo Lingling's sparrow-like chatter. After last night's victory, he'd meditated till daybreak. Though cultivation refreshed spirit, his low rank strained body's limits. A wry twist touched his lips – the path to power stretched long indeed. Physical tempering must come first.

"My little songbird, must you chirp so? These eyes scarce closed..."

**Chapter 1522: Elder Candidate**

Guan Yu suddenly swept the chattering girl into his arms. Huo Lingling froze, breath caught.

"Why so flushed?" Guan Yu blinked innocently.

"Brother... release me..." Crimson spread across her neck.

"But I've always held you thus. What changes today?" He nuzzled her silken hair.

Her pale complexion now glowed ruby, fingers plucking nervously at sleeves.

"Very well." Relenting, Guan Yu chuckled. "What urgent matter rouses me at dawn?"

Huo Lingling exhaled relief. "I... wanted to thank you for saving me from Wang Chao yesterday."

"Natural duty to family. How else explain to the patriarch?"

"Is that all?" Her murmur barely escaped.

"What?"

"N-nothing! Elder Altai bids you hurry to council – urgent matters!"

"After dressing."

"I'll wait outside!" She fled like startled deer. Guan Yu shook his head. "Do I resemble flood or beast?"

Watching her retreat, he pondered: Could this girl harbor... improper affections?

......

The council hall, constructed by Elder Altai's grandfather from Wutanaris riverbed crystals and three tons of molten mountain jade, bore witness to Lin family's former glory. As Guan Yu entered, elders' gazes converged – admiration, pride, skepticism, envy. Unperturbed, he took a corner seat. Years of such looks bred immunity; humans worship strength and scorn weakness regardless.

"Today's assembly concerns this year's Elder Candidate nominations." Elder Altai's voice stilled the hall. "Recommendations are advisory – final decision rests with Patriarch Lin Mo."

The implication hung clear: This nomination served Guan Yu. None dared oppose Altai, whose White Crystal Battle King prowess and mind-reading arts commanded absolute respect.

"Has Council considered Lin Hui's son Guan Yu?" Altai boomed. "His reclamation of Wutanaris' prime jade source merits candidacy!"

Guan Yu's lips parted, then sealed.

"Any objections? Superior candidates?"

Eyes dropped throughout the hall. None wished to challenge Altai's might.

"Then this matter is–"

"Guan Yu is unworthy."

All turned to Lin Hui's father, Patriarch Lin Mo. "His strength remains inadequate. The candidate should be Lin Yu of Lin Jing's line."

Gasps rippled. Elder Altai's face darkened – this obstinate old leopard sabotaged his own bloodline! Little did he know the nomination's true peril.

......

After dismissing inconsequential debates, Lin Hui summoned Guan Yu to the gardens.

"Son, understand my purpose."

"I do..."

"This nomination would chain you to petty local politics. Your destiny lies beyond these walls."

Silence. Then: "Thank you... Father."

Lin Hui produced several manuals. "Cultivation techniques. May they aid your journey."

Guan Yu's nose stung as he accepted the books. He turned quickly, hiding moist eyes from his father's teasing.

**Chapter 1523: Qiankun Palm**

Beyond the garden waited Huo Lingling, crimson robes accentuating porcelain features. She started as arms encircled her waist.

"Who awaits so anxiously?"

"You, of course!" She turned, pouting.

"Truly?" Guan Yu teased.

Her delicate fist feigned strike at his chest. "Who else would I await?"

"Peace, I jest. What brings you?"

"Why did Uncle block your candidacy?"

"His faith in me."

At her puzzled frown, he explained: "He believes I'll achieve greatness beyond this city's confines."

Huo Lingling embraced him, fingertips brushing the shadows beneath his eyes. "He's wise."

"Come – time for training."

......

The training grove echoed with colliding palms, swirling autumn leaves in their wake. Ominous clouds mirrored the combatants' energies – Guan Yu's inky darkness against Huo Lingling's radiant white.

"Improved, yes?" She laughed, fist sheathed in blinding light.

Guan Yu licked lips, battle-lust rising. Their qi spheres collided in silent cataclysm, dissolving into ether.

"Take this!" Huo Lingling lunged, fist cratering earth where Guan Yu stood moments before.

"Murderous intent, sister?" He grinned from behind her.

"Knew you'd dodge!" She reformed qi, challenging: "A qi contest?"

As dark and light energies coalesced, storm clouds mirrored their gathering power. The very air hummed with impending revelation.
