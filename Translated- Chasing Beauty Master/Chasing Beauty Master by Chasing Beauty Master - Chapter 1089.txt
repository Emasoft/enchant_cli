“Ah, if I weren’t in such a hurry to sell, I wouldn’t be letting go of so many shares at such a low price,” Guan Yu grumbled. “Well, better to let our own people benefit than outsiders, I suppose.”

As he spoke, Guan Yu finished signing the documents and handed them to Lawyer Liu. “Lawyer Liu, take a look. Is everything in order now?”

Lawyer Liu eagerly picked up the papers, scanned them, and replied with satisfaction, “All set. Once Yao Yu transfers the agreed amount to you, the transaction will be complete.”

The prospect of millions more flowing in thrilled Lawyer Liu. “Since we’re all free today, why don’t I treat everyone to dinner later?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “I’ll pass. You two go ahead. After being swindled by you, I’ve lost my appetite. I’ve decided to fast for a few days to balance things out—and Lü Mei’s joining me.”

Yao Yu knew Guan Yu’s words were aimed at her, but she remained unfazed. “Hehe, Lü Mei does look a bit plump lately. Eating less might do her good as a young lady.”

Guan Yu sighed. Outarguing Yao Yu was impossible; she was a seasoned player in the business world, her wit unmatched. Without ceremony, Yao Yu picked up a card from the coffee table and handed it to him. “This card holds exactly twenty million. The password’s on the back. Feel free to check the balance now if you doubt me.”

“No need. If I’ve already lost nearly twenty million, why would I fear a shortfall here?” Guan Yu pocketed the card.

Yao Yu blinked in surprise. “You knew you lost twenty million?” She glanced at Lawyer Liu, incredulous.

“Of course. I’m no fool. Though I’m not well-versed in stocks, I have a rough idea of these shares’ value. I just didn’t want the hassle.”

Turning to Lawyer Liu, Guan Yu added, “I initially planned to entrust you with selling my remaining assets, but given how you’ve betrayed your employer, I can’t use your services anymore.”

Yao Yu offered an apologetic smile. “You’ve walked away with twenty million effortlessly. That’s already a great deal. We’ve toiled tirelessly yet earned far less, haven’t we?”

“Aunt Yao, you always spin things to your advantage—reaping benefits while playing the victim,” Guan Yu retorted wearily. Eager to leave before Yao Yu remembered the news scandal and stirred more trouble, he called upstairs, “You two, come down! We’re leaving.”

Yao Yu stood, attempting to delay them. “Stay for dinner! Why rush off when you’ve barely visited?”

“No. Can’t you see those two refuse to come down? Even if we stayed, they’d hide in their rooms. Lü Mei’s your daughter—surely you know her temper?”

Yao Yu chuckled. “Very well, I won’t insist.” Earlier, after seeing the news, she’d initially panicked but believed Lü Mei’s explanation. She trusted her daughter never lied to her, especially now that she’d accepted Guan Yu.

**Chapter 2785: Calling for Help**

Yao Yu had deliberately provoked Lü Mei to leave. Had her daughter stayed, Yao Yu might’ve harshened her taunts. With Lü Mei gone, no one remained to demand money for Guan Yu, securing today’s success.

This was Yao Yu’s true scheme. Though the deal was sealed and profits secured, Lü Mei and Xue Jing descended the stairs without a glance at Yao Yu, slipping on their shoes and darting to the car outside.

They left without bidding farewell, leaving Yao Yu with a pang of emptiness. Had her gain cost her daughter’s coldness? She consoled herself that time would heal things. A gift to the Qiao Yuan District would mend all.

While Lü Mei might disrespect her mother, Xue Jing wouldn’t. As a junior, Xue Jing felt obliged to show courtesy. Dragged into the car, she protested, “Lü Mei, even if you’re angry, I can’t be rude. I should at least say goodbye.”

“Jingjie, are you truly my friend?” Lü Mei snapped, blocking her exit.

Xue Jing sighed. “Of course, but I won’t let others mock my manners.” Ignoring Lü Mei’s glare, she stepped out to bid farewell.

Guan Yu watched helplessly. When Lü Mei’s temper flared, she acknowledged no one—not even him. Now, not even Yao Yu dared provoke her.

“Aunt Yao, since our business is concluded, I’ll take my leave. You and Lawyer Liu can celebrate your gains.”

Yao Yu feigned courtesy. “Must you rush off? Stay for a meal!”

“No. Besides…” Guan Yu paused. “Lü Mei won’t stay either. She’s still furious.”

Yao Yu knew they’d refuse. “Then drive safely. I won’t see you out.”

“Goodbye, Aunt Yao,” Xue Jing interjected politely.

Back in Qiao Yuan District, Lü Mei’s anger melted upon seeing the grand bouquet in the living room. Everyone there had received gifts, radiating joy. Amei and Yingzi chatted animatedly on the sofa about flowers.

Yingzi described the blossoms of her hometown, while Amei—a former star accustomed to lavish bouquets—declared this the most beautiful she’d ever seen.

Only Zhang Han remained indifferent, glued to her game. Even when Amei delivered her flowers, she mumbled, “Pretty. Leave them there. I’m busy fighting monsters,” and hadn’t glanced since.

Returning home, Guan Yu found the women cheerful. He wondered how others outside had reacted to their flowers. If not for Yao Yu, he’d never have thought to gift them—ironic gratitude.

**Poison Widow’s Gambit**

Poison Widow, having left the Feng family, resided in a secluded village—a tranquil, spacious contrast to the crowded city. Her choice hid another motive: the treasure map.

Long hearing rumors of the map, she’d established a temporary base here, relocating her Dark Sun Organization. When the Fang family sought her aid against Guan Yu, she agreed, hoping to link it to the map.

Instead, the alliance destroyed the Fangs and nearly cost Poison Widow her life. Guan Yu’s overwhelming force haunted her. Of her 100 cultivators, only 70 survived.

“Guan Yu, this isn’t over,” she hissed, nursing bitter wine.

Bill Lin, her collaborator, had coaxed her into summoning a renowned ally: Yuan Shanding, the 41-year-old “Mountain King” of ** Mountain. With a hundred followers, he’d crushed rivals to dominate the impoverished region.

**Chapter 2786: The Mountain King Arrives**

Yuan Shanding’s reputation as a ruthless bandit belied his loyalty. Years ago, Poison Widow saved his life, a debt he never forgot. At her call, he rallied 50 elite cultivators and 200 newer recruits, galloping toward her village at dusk.

Hooves thundered as the convoy arrived, startling villagers and dogs alike. Leading on a crimson steed, Yuan Shanding halted at the village’s edge, consulting his wife, Jiu Biyun—a stalwart partner who’d stood by him despite infertility. They’d adopted a son, doted as their own.

“Brother Yuan, you came so swiftly!” Poison Widow greeted, ushering them into her compound.

“For my sworn sister, no delay!” Yuan Shanding boomed, dismounting. Behind him trailed his top aides—Da Zai and Er Zai, near first-class cultivators.

As horses were stabled, Poison Widow led them inside, relief mingling with scheming resolve. The game against Guan Yu had just escalated.
