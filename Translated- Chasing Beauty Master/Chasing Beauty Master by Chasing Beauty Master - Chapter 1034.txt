“Call a fucking ambulance, my ass! I’m the one who beat these people! What of it? I’m just taking a breather before beating them again. Who the hell do you think you are to meddle?” A lanky young man with dyed yellow hair, seated inside, roared at Hou Jinshun.

Hou Jinshun glanced over. The speaker sat on a chair flanked by three others, clearly all part of the same group. These four had stationed themselves here to wait for Guan Yu’s arrival. Meanwhile, a boy on the other side pulled out his phone to make a call.

The yellow-haired youth inside pointed furiously at him. “Fuck your mother! Still daring to call? Beat him!”

The boy turned to flee, but his injured leg slowed him. Two thugs wielding large cleavers charged forward, overturning every computer desk and chair in their path to sow chaos.

The boy recording with his phone belonged to the Yu Gang, as did the beaten girl. Hou Jinshun noted the boy’s limp and leg injury, realizing he stood no chance alone. The boy had already called for help when the girl was attacked and now sought to gather evidence, but his injury and the numerical disadvantage forced caution.

Hou Jinshun itched to intervene, but Guan Yu had strictly forbidden action. As the cleaver-wielding thugs closed in on the limping boy, anxiety gripped him.

“Who dares cause trouble here?” A furious bellow erupted from outside as Qian Yunqing pushed through the crowd at the entrance.

Hou Jinshun recognized Qian Yunqing, knowing his sister Qian Yaoyao was Wei Hongwei’s girlfriend, though Qian remained unaware of Hou’s identity.

Relief washed over Hou—Qian Yunqing, a cultivator of considerable skill, could handle this.

“Another fucking busybody!” The yellow-haired youth sneered from his chair, annoyed their target Guan Yu hadn’t arrived. These were Sun Xu’s men, paid upfront to stir chaos until Guan’s appearance. Sun Xu, collaborating with Bill Lin against Guan Yu, dared not show himself, fearing retribution.

Since this wasn’t Guan, Sun’s orders were clear: attack anyone interfering.

Sun Xu had chosen Qian Yunqing’s internet café precisely, aware of its ownership and Qian Yaoyao’s ties to Wei Hongwei. Though Sun knew Qian, his lackeys didn’t. Qian lived quietly, managing two family-owned cafés with his sister.

The café attendant hurried to Qian. “Boss! That yellow-haired punk and his crew wrecked the place. Look at that girl—they beat her beyond recognition!”

Qian surveyed the devastation—overturned computers, prime evening business ruined. Rage ignited. “Who sent you? Explain now, or none of you leave!”

“Fuck your posturing! Kill him!” The yellow-haired leader brandished his cleaver and charged.

The shrewd cameraman limped behind Qian for protection. Two attackers swung at Qian’s head with their cleavers. The crowd gasped as Qian caught one wrist mid-swing, the blade halted inches from his skull.

With a wrenching twist, Qian snapped the man’s arm. The cleaver clattered as he disarmed him, blocking the second attacker. Fists flew, teeth shattered, noses bled—two thugs crumpled, groaning.

The yellow-haired leader froze, stunned. Sun’s supposedly skilled men fell like wheat. Advancing meant sharing their fate—a fool’s errand.

“This is your warning!” Qian thundered. “Cross me again, and this is your end!” Normally peaceable, he seethed at these disruptions to his livelihood.

“You’re in over your head, punk!” the leader blustered, emboldened by Sun Xu and the Feng family’s backing. “Apologize now, or—”

“Explain yourselves!” Qian demanded. “Or you’ll leave here horizontal!”

“Fuck your explanations! We answer to higher powers! You’re dead meat!”

Qian cared not for their masters—the café’s damages demanded compensation. “I’ve called the police. They’ll handle you.”

“Die, meddler!” The leader lunged. Hou Jinshun noted the attacker’s pitiful Third-Class Honorable cultivation—suicidal against Qian’s Second-Class strength.

Blades clashed, sparks flying. Qian feinted, then slammed his blade’s flat against the leader’s face, sweeping his legs. A crack echoed as the youth sprawled, cheek crimson.

“Kill him!” the leader screeched, retreating. To Qian’s surprise, over a dozen hidden accomplices surged from the crowd, wielding steel pipes.

Hou watched calmly—Qian could handle this. Though outnumbered, Qian’s cultivation outclassed them. A kick felled the first attacker, but cramped space allowed a pipe to strike Qian’s skull. Blood trickled, but he fought on, strikes growing ruthless.

“He’s hurt! Finish him!” the leader urged. Yet as comrades fell, hesitation spread.

A baton-wielder crept behind Qian, but he blocked blindly, crushing the man’s groin with a backward kick. The attacker collapsed, pale and sweating.

Panic gripped the leader—without men, their trap for Guan Yu would fail. He dialed Sun Xu. “Boss! Some cultivator’s wrecking our men! Guan Yu’s not here!”

“Treat him as Guan Yu,” Sun ordered. Capturing Qian would pressure Wei Hongwei through Qian Yaoyao.

Reinvigorated, the leader rallied remnants. Within minutes, Qian subdued them all, glaring at the trembling ringleader. “Compensate my losses, or you’re not leaving!”

“You’ll pay for this!” The leader dialed police. Sirens wailed outside.

Qian smirked. “Good—let them see your crimes.”

Officers stormed in, dispersing bystanders. Hou slipped out to avoid exposure. The limping Yu Gang member approached an officer. “They attacked first. The boss stopped them. I have video proof.”

“Lies!” the leader countered. “He attacked us!”

The officer ignored both, demanding Qian’s documents. “Show me your license and ID.”

Qian complied, adding, “Surveillance footage was hacked and destroyed.”

“No evidence, then,” the officer said, as the leader smirked. Outside influences had clearly reached the law. The stage was set for injustice—unless the phone’s recording turned the tide...
