At once, the families aligned with the Song clan grew uneasy, flooding the Song residence with calls. Only after receiving firm reassurances did their anxieties abate. Yet puzzlement lingered—how had Guan Yu emerged unscathed from his solo venture into the Song stronghold? Had some clandestine pact been struck?

Speculation ran rife among rival houses. Many feared being duped by the Songs into aiding their own betrayal while counting silver coins for their captors.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's faction breathed newfound vigor. After days of being pummeled without reprieve by Song assaults, this pivotal news lifted their spirits like a cleansing gale. Confidence in toppling the Song dynasty surged within their ranks.

**At the Hu Family Estate**

"Guan Yu! What brings you here?" Hu Zongze nearly toppled from his chair at the intruder's arrival. News of Guan Yu's exit from Song territory had barely registered before the man materialized at their doorstep—a development both baffling and alarming.

"What if I said I came to thrash you? Would you believe it?"

"Young man! This is the Hu residence!" snapped Elder Wang, standing rigid beside Hu Zongze. The aged retainer's voice dripped frost, recalling his previous threats at the Imperial Academy—exchanges Guan Yu remembered all too clearly.

"Well met, Elder Wang. Wasn't there talk of teaching me a lesson? I've yet to see this grand instruction materialize."

The elder's face darkened like storm clouds. "Do you mock your elders, boy?"

"Mockery? No. I state plain truth—your time has passed. Retirement suits you better than meddling in youth's quarrels." Guan Yu's tone remained casual, indifferent to the elder's purpling visage.

"Insolent whelp!"

Though nominally a steward, Elder Wang shared brotherly bonds with the Hu patriarch. Even Hu Zongze dared not address him thus. Incensed by this humiliation, the old warrior lunged with military precision—a former elite commando's grip seizing Guan Yu's arm in a bone-twisting hold meant to snap limbs.

Yet as pressure mounted, the younger man's flesh transformed to iron-hard resilience. Unbeknownst to the elder, Guan Yu's异能 (supernatural ability) channeled gravitational forces into reinforced musculature.

"I said you're obsolete."

A thunderous kick sent Elder Wang crashing across marble floors. Blood sprayed from his lips as he crumpled—a testament to Guan Yu's mercy, for full force would have meant instant death.

**Chapter 1090: The Hu Family's Olive Branch**

"I'll end you, Guan Yu!" Hu Zongze roared, charging to avenge his surrogate grandfather's disgrace.

"Stand down, Zongze!" A weathered voice halted the heir mid-lunge.

"Grandfather! He insults our house!" protested Hu Zongze as Patriarch Hu Zhongxin entered—eyes sharp despite his years, radiating vitality that justified whispers of the Hu leader's enduring vigor.

"Withdraw." The patriarch waved dismissively before appraising Guan Yu. "They say 'May my descendants rival princes.' Henceforth, let it be 'May my heirs emulate Guan Yu.' Old Wen and Liu chose well."

His admiration held weight. Decades of governance honed his judgment—where others saw a provincial youth, Hu Zhongxin recognized the steel beneath Guan Yu's casual demeanor. Compared to his own hotheaded heir, the contrast proved stark.

"Since you're Wen's grandson-in-law, I'll presume familiarity—sit, Xiaoyu." The overture of peace hung palpable.

Guan Yu inclined his head, accepting the offered seat as courtesies demanded.

"How fare Old Wen and Liu?"

Baffled but polite, Guan Yu nodded.

"We campaigned together in our prime—brothers-in-arms sharing life and death..."

"Grandfather!" Hu Zongze interjected, "Why reminisce with this—"

"Silence!" The patriarch's rare rebuke stunned the room. A tug from Elder Wang restrained the fuming heir.

Hu Zhongxin continued smoothly, "Zongze's temper flares—you'll overlook this, Xiaoyu?"

The question hung loaded. Guan Yu cut through pretense: "Speak plainly, Elder Hu."

"Very well. Our houses' feud ends now. The Hu clan withdraws from this conflict."

Shock rippled through the chamber. Hu Zongze paled. "Why retreat? Do we fear him?!"

A resounding slap answered him. "Out!"

The heir staggered, venomous glare locking on Guan Yu before storming out.

"My apologies for this spectacle." The patriarch's contrition seemed genuine.

Guan Yu rose. "Your stance noted. I take leave."

"Elder Wang will—"

"Unnecessary." Guan Yu departed with Tang Xiao, leaving simmering tensions behind.

**Chapter 1091: The Song Family's Plight**

As Guan Yu exited, Hu Zhongxin's mask slipped—features hardening. "Fetch Zongze."

Meanwhile, Tang Xiao pondered aloud: "Why such submission? A general turned meek..."

"Deception," Guan Yu snorted. "The old fox plays weak to buy time. His heir's no tiger—housecat at best."

Tang Xiao marveled at his leader's perspicacity. Where he saw retreat, Guan Yu discerned strategy—a chessmaster anticipating moves threefold.

The conflict's fever pitch saw minor houses crumbling daily. Vacated positions and assets fed bureaucrats and merchants alike—vultures profiting from noble houses' collapse.

Though the Songs seemed cornered, their overseas branches loomed—Taiwanese and American counterparts potentially tipping scales. Yet Guan Yu remained unfazed, knowing Beijing's prohibition against foreign interference clipped those wings.

**Chapter 1092: Coerced Courtship**

At a familiar café where Li Xi once faced abduction, Guan Yu sipped espresso until a bespectacled girl accosted him.

"Comfortable?" She slid opposite him, removing shades to reveal striking eyes.

"Afternoons demand leisure."

"Spare the Songs."

"Reason?"

"Me." Her coquettish smile held calculated charm.

"Unpersuasive."

"None?" She pouted. "Am I so plain?"

"Only my wives hold sway."

"Then take me as one!"

"Uninvited baggage?"

"Guan Yu!" She bristled. "I offer freely!"

"Declined."

"Hypocrite! You collect spouses like stamps!"

"To what end, this meeting?"

The standoff crystallized—another gambit in the endless game of thrones, where romance and rivalry danced their eternal waltz.
