“What’s the matter, cat got your tongue now?” Master Qin roared furiously. “Your entire Cao family compound is surrounded by five thousand Imperial Guards! Now you’ve realized fear, haven’t you?”

Master Cao stared silently at his accuser. Though he’d initially hoped to beg for mercy and perhaps secure an escape route through Master Qin’s assistance, such delusions now lay shattered. The man before him clearly thirsted for his demise—no quarter would be given.

A messenger rushed in announcing the Eldest Prince’s arrival with the Imperial Guard. Having failed to locate Master Cao elsewhere, the royal entourage now descended upon the Qin estate with martial pomp.

“Summon Master Qin immediately,” the Eldest Prince commanded without preamble, “or surrender Master Cao at once.”

Within moments, Master Qin and his son Qin Huan emerged, bowing deeply. “Your Highness honors us with your presence,” Master Qin groveled. “We beg forgiveness for lacking proper reception.”

Though unpopular in the capital, the prince’s royal blood demanded deference.

“Master Qin,” the prince’s voice dripped ice, “rumors claim you harbor the fugitive Master Cao. Explain why he sought your residence in the dead of night.”

Before Master Qin could respond, guards roughly shoved Master Cao forward. “A grave misunderstanding, Your Highness!” Master Qin protested. “He came begging aid, but how could I comply? Our households share no ties! Take him—do as you will!”

At this betrayal, Master Cao wheeled on his former ally, eyes blazing. “Qin! You think mere words can sever our alliance? My downfall ensures yours!”

“You—” Master Qin sputtered, aghast at this deathbed calumny.

“Lying cur!” Master Qin bellowed. “You’d drag my house down with you? These baseless accusations—”

“You orchestrated everything!” Master Cao roared back. “Now you feign innocence? If I perish, you’ll join me in hell!”

The prince motioned guards to remove Master Cao. As for the Qins—investigations would determine their fate, not a condemned man’s ravings.

Meanwhile in the palace, Princess Jiangxin rested through the afternoon, attended by the Princess Royal. The Emperor, exhausted from the night’s crisis, had retired. The Princess Royal eventually succumbed to fatigue herself, slumbering by her daughter’s bedside.

These two women held the Emperor’s deepest affection. The Princess Royal’s mother, his most beloved consort famed as the palace’s peerless beauty, had perished in childbirth. This tragedy forged an unbreakable bond between the Emperor and his firstborn daughter.

When the Princess Royal later endured her own perilous delivery bearing Jiangxin, physicians barely saved her. The trauma left Princess Jiangxin an only child—her parents dared not risk another pregnancy.

Thus doted upon by both Emperor and mother, Jiangxin matured surprisingly humble and dutiful. The recent ordeal had shaken the Princess Royal profoundly.

News of Jiangxin’s abduction rippled through court. Among the concerned was Virtuous Consort Guifen, mother to the Eldest Prince. Typically reclusive to protect her son’s precarious position, she now stirred from seclusion.

Carrying an embroidered sachet of her own making, Consort Guifen approached Jiangxin’s chambers. “The Princess Royal and young mistress rest,” a maid informed. “Please return later.”

Resigned, Consort Guifen offered the sachet. “A token for Princess Jiangxin—may it bless her recovery.”

The maid marveled at the exquisite craftsmanship and refreshing fragrance. Before departing, Consort Guifen started at the Princess Royal’s summons from within.

“We appreciate your concern,” the Princess Royal said wearily after accepting the gift. Though court rivals envied Jiangxin’s imperial favor, Consort Guifen’s sincerity shone genuine.

After the consort’s departure, Jiangxin awoke complaining of hunger. As maids scurried for refreshments, the girl noticed the scented sachet. “How lovely! Who—?”

“From Consort Guifen,” her mother explained. “The Eldest Prince’s mother. He rescued you, remember?”

Jiangxin frowned. “Uncle Prince? But I recall... it was Wàn Hóng who saved me. He fought off those brutes, carried me back...” Her voice trembled recounting Cao Di’s assault.

The Princess Royal’s smile faltered. “Darling, you were feverish. The Eldest Prince brought you home.”

“No!” Jiangxin insisted. “Wàn Hóng cradled me all the way. His arms... so strong...” A blush crept her cheeks as she recalled the vigilante’s protective embrace.

Alarm gripped the Princess Royal. This “Wàn Hóng”—whose very name haunted her—now threatened to eclipse Jiangxin’s betrothed, Chu Fan. The girl’s detailed recollections—Wàn Hóng’s whispered reassurance, “Don’t fear. I’ll take you home”—suggested dangerous attachment.

“Rest now,” the Princess Royal deflected. But her mind raced. This mysterious savior’s motives? His faction? Why had investigators found nothing? Until answers came, she resolved to keep Jiangxin distant from the enigma.

Their conversation halted with the Emperor’s arrival. “My precious! Summon the physicians!”

“I’m fine, Grandfather!” Jiangxin laughed through mouthfuls, uniquely privileged to dine unabashed before the throne. As the Emperor beamed, the Princess Royal watched her daughter’s innocent joy—and feared the storm clouds gathering around Wàn Hóng’s shadow.
