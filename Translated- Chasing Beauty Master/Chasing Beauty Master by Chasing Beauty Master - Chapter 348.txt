“Then, he clapped his hands, drawing curious glances from everyone present.

The atmosphere became subtly ambiguous. None present were fools - though many of these second-generation heirs had peculiar tempers, their intelligence wasn't lacking. Zhao Qianxiong hadn't particularly hidden his intention to curry favor, and all present understood his motives.

Yet even knowing his aim was to ingratiate himself, irrepressible curiosity remained. After all, men's desires towards women ran strong, especially when facing extraordinary beauties.

After clapping, Zhao Qianxiong calmly resumed his seat.

The next act would feature his prized bet for today's wager. To win over these young masters, the offerings couldn't be mediocre - poor quality would insult rather than flatter.

The profligate sons of the capital most despised receiving dogshit when expecting bear paws.

As the private room's lights dimmed, the glass door slid open. Under Zhao Qianxiong's smug gaze, tonight's "main course" unfolded before Xu Yuan and Jiang Ziqi.

A slight nod. The face concealing pure innocence revealed a hint of shyness.

Jiang Ziqi remained composed, but Xu Yuan's eyes betrayed barely restrained mirth.

"Qianxiong, where did you find such premium goods? I've frequented your place before - were you hiding the best stock?"

Though outwardly scolded, Zhao Qianxiong inwardly rejoiced. Xu Yuan's crude language indicated pleasure.

"Where? Where? Young Master Xu's approval honors this Zhao!" Beaming, he urged the newcomers to toast.

The twin sisters entering were barely eighty-pointers in looks, but their virginal innocence and identical features added ten points. When Zhao first found them, even he lusted. If not for his... inadequacies, they'd have been deflowered long ago.

Though Jiang Ziqi lacked lustful tendencies, he raised his cup: "Brother Zhao, drink with me?"

Zhao Qianxiong flattered, twin sisters pouring wine. As Zhao raised his cup, a thunderous crash erupted.

An unidentified object plummeted onto the table, smashing exquisite dishes to ruin.

Zhao's face flushed crimson with rage. Recognizing his right-hand man Tian Boyuan as the projectile, he wheeled furiously toward the intruder.

"Ho! Jiang Ziqi, living the high life!" Guan Yu glanced at the twins, smirking.

"Who are you? Seeking death?" Zhao roared, slamming the table.

Guan Yu coldly eyed him: "Your lackey ruined my cake. We'll settle your account later. Now scram!"

Zhao momentarily froze, then realization dawned. Snatching his phone, he advanced threateningly.

"Who the hell do you think you are? You won't leave here alive!"

As Zhao approached, Guan Yu grinned. "Done talking? Then sleep."

A thunderous fist collided with Zhao's face. The burly man crumpled, unconscious.

"Pathetic." Guan Yu grabbed a wine bottle, sneering at Jiang Ziqi. "Your taste disappoints."

Xu Yuan rose, eyeing the twins. Guan Yu moved faster, seizing both girls.

"Want them? Tough luck!"

"GUAN YU!" Xu Yuan bellowed.

The tranquility shattered. Xu Yuan, habitual spectator, now burned with rage. Watching Zhao fall wasn't the issue - Guan Yu's madness exceeded bounds.

Guan宇 casually swigged wine, smirking. "Xu Da-shao, calling me?"

"Release them!" Xu growled.

"Denied." Guan宇 dragged a twin closer. The girl yelped as Guan宇 wiped snot on her chest, thrusting her at Xu.

"FUCK!" Xu recoiled into soft flesh and... snot.

"Want them to jerk you off? I'll film it!" Guan宇 taunted.

"GUAN YU!" Xu and Jiang roared simultaneously.

Xu scrubbed his face furiously. Jiang's calm cracked. "What do you want?"

Guan宇 advanced,瓜子 in hand. "You emerged? Thought you turtle-hid."

Jiang's shadow emerged - Xiao Dao. "Mr. Jiang."

"Xiao Dao, toss him."

"One hand suffices." Xiao Dao's tone bored.

Guan宇 hurled a bottle. Xiao Dao sidestepped effortlessly. Guan宇 charged, elbow swinging with augmented force.

Xiao Dao shifted, counter-elbowing Guan宇's wrist. CRACK! Guan宇 staggered, ribs fractured.

"Break his legs!" Jiang ordered.

Guan宇 shrugged, charging anew under gravity boost. Plain fist rocketed toward Xiao Dao's face.

Xiao Dao parried, elbow meeting wrist. Thud! Guan宇 retreated, bleeding.

Jiang sneered: "This society rewards results, not fairness. Today you'll regret crossing me."

Xiao Dao's eyebrow twitched. This target proved unexpectedly resilient.

Fist met elbow. GRUNT! Guan宇 retreated, ribs screaming. Treatment system activated, healing energy flowing.

Jiang smirked. Xiao Dao's stolid expression finally cracked - this target's resilience defied reason.

The ex-special forces veteran faced unprecedented challenge. Guan宇's speed INCREASED under assault. Unheard of!
