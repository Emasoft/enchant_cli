Wang Xiaorong's heart fluttered with restless urgency. Though delighted by the prospect of reuniting with Guan Yu after their prolonged separation, anxiety gnawed at her as she fussed over her appearance in the chamber. Her spirit had already flown ahead to their meeting, leaving her hands to mechanically adjust hair ornaments and silken robes.

"Has the Young Mistress finished preparing?" inquired the Left Envoy's voice beyond the door, his shadow visible through the paper screen.

"Almost! I must look perfect!" came Wang Xiaorong's breathless reply. Emerging in a swirl of embroidered gauze, she presented herself with arms outstretched. "Well?"

The Left Envoy's eyes widened. The already striking maiden now glowed with celestial radiance, her vermilion lips and kohl-rimmed eyes enhancing natural beauty into devastating allure. "The moon itself would hide in shame before you, Young Mistress. No further adornment is needed."

"Nonsense! For Guan Yu, only perfection suffices." She adjusted a jade hairpin with trembling fingers. "You'll escort me personally?"

"As the Demon Sovereign commands. His Lordship insisted I deliver you safely." The Left Envoy's expression sobered. "Two branch hall masters will shadow us. Your father's orders."

Wang Xiaorong's delicate nostrils flared. "Tell those lurking oafs to keep their distance! If Guan Yu objects to their presence, I'll vanish into thin air and give Father apoplexy!"

The envoy sighed, recognizing the futility of argument. While the Demon Sovereign mobilized his elite guard against the Red Lotus Sect's recent assaults, his willful daughter remained oblivious to danger. "Consider this," he offered tactfully, "Young Master Guan's reputation precedes him. With his... unique capabilities, perhaps extra protection proves unnecessary."

"Precisely!" She tossed her head, obsidian hair swirling. "Between Guan Yu's divine artifacts and my own cultivation, we need no nursemaids! Now make haste - I'll not travel with those creaking old vultures!"

One hundred days of rigorous training had transformed Guan Yu under Xiao Qi's tutelage. Where Wang Xiaorong's crude disguise techniques relied on false beards and swapped robes, the boy prodigy taught profound metamorphosis - bone-shifting mantras and supple beast-hide masks indistinguishable from true flesh.

"Remember your promise!" The elfin instructor brandished a honey-glazed pastry, sticky fingers gesturing emphatically. "That repeating crossbow design better be worth my lessons!"

Guan Yu chuckled, pushing aside a plate of cloying desserts. "Patience, little master. When next we meet, you'll have schematics to make even the Artificer's Guild gasp."

Dusk found Prince Zou's retinue finalizing preparations at a riverside inn. Twenty-three mercenaries and shadowy operatives filled the courtyard, their price negotiated through discreet channels. "We depart at dawn with or without Guan Yu," the prince declared, observing his sons review the roster. "The capital's jackals scent weakness."

"Surprise!" Wang Xiaorong's cry echoed through the safehouse as she launched herself at the unfamiliar face. Guan Yu staggered back, the expertly crafted mask slipping to reveal his true features. "You wretched fox! Making me fret all this way!"

Left Envoy cleared his throat, eyeing the strategic maps unfurled nearby. "The Demon Sovereign's terms are clear. Any harm befalling the Young Mistress, and rivers of blood will flow." His gaze hardened. "I trust you grasp the... complications of sheltering her while aiding Prince Zou?"

Guan Yu gently disentangled himself from the clinging maiden. "Your shadows may withdraw. Our safety lies in secrecy, not steel." Producing a lacquered case, he revealed an array of disguises. "The Red Lotus Sect hunts demons, not humble pilgrims. We'll vanish into our new roles before dawn."

As the Left Envoy departed with reluctant approval, Wang Xiaorong twirled in her coarse hemp garments, transformed from celestial beauty to rustic maiden. "Well?" She struck a mock-ferocious pose with a firewood bundle. "Do I charm as a woodcutter's daughter?"

Guan Yu's laughter faded as distant temple bells tolled the hour. Somewhere beyond these walls, assassins sharpened blades and rival sects stirred. Tomorrow's journey would test more than disguise arts - it would challenge the very balance between mortal politics and cultivation world intrigues.
