“Nothing. This fool just had the nerve to target me. Do I look like some rich guy? By the way, why are you here?” Guan Yu asked Huang Shan. He had originally called to have her notify the station’s duty officers, expecting someone else to come.

“Oh, I happened to be on duty tonight. I came straight over after your call,” Huang Shan replied, offering another word of thanks.

“No need for formalities. We’re friends, and it was just a small favor.” Guan Yu felt awkward under her repeated gratitude.

Huang Shan grew serious. “This was no small favor. We’ve been tracking this suspect for a long time. He’s committed multiple crimes in this area—robberies, rapes… Recently, the bureau even formed a special task force to monitor this district. Last time, he nearly slipped through our fingers, but thanks to you, we finally caught him.”

Surprised the man was a repeat offender, Guan Yu remarked, “With so many crimes, he must have accomplices. You should investigate thoroughly.”

Huang Shan nodded. “Guan Yu, there’s one more thing. You’ll need to come to the station for a statement. Since you apprehended this major suspect, there’s a reward—”

“Ah, keep the reward. Just say you caught him. I’ll skip the statement—you know what happened. I’ve got things to do. Bye!” Before she could protest, Guan Yu vanished like a thief, dragging Qing Linger away.

Huang Shan touched her delicate face, baffled. *Did I scare him off? Am I that intimidating?*

As Guan Yu drove Qing Linger back to Pan Taisheng’s apartment, she asked from the passenger seat, “Why didn’t you go with that officer?”

“Too much hassle. Plus, I’m not fond of cops,” he shrugged.

Dropping her off late at night, Qing Linger suggested, “It’s a long drive back. Why not stay here?”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. *Is this my chance?* Masking his excitement, he feigned reluctance. “Well… it *is* late. I’ll make do here tonight.”

Upstairs, her room carried a refreshing scent—not perfume or flowers, but her natural fragrance. Unlike Yang Conghan’s subtle musk, Qing Linger’s aroma was light yet invigorating, detectable only to others, especially men.

The scent electrified Guan Yu’s senses. As Qing Linger excused herself to shower, he nearly blurted, *“Why wait? Let’s skip the bath!”* Instead, he grinned. “Take your time. I’ll be waiting.”

Puzzled but unbothered, she left. Guan Yu nibbled a bitter, chemically-ripened orange before wandering into her bedroom. Her lingerie—black lace, sheer mesh—sent his pulse racing. Sniffing the garments, he stripped and burrowed under her fragrant quilt.

Emerging from her bath in a towel, Qing Linger found him sprawled on her bed. “Guan… what are you doing?!”

“Waiting for you,” he declared. “No point pretending now. Let’s go!”

Blushing crimson at her exposed lingerie, she fled to another room. *He’s saved me countless times… I do like him… but he’s with Miss Yang! Is this just a fling? I’m not that kind of girl!*

Meanwhile, Guan Yu facepalmed. *Misread the signals! Need to cool it.* He slept till noon, finding breakfast laid out—burgers, steamed eggs, bacon.

Mid-meal, the doorbell rang. A veiled, sunglasses-clad woman stood outside. “Looking for someone?”

“You.”

Yanking her inside, Guan Yu gaped as she revealed herself—Jin Hua, thinner and paler but still striking. “How’d you find me?”

“I know your every move.” Her voice dripped sweetness despite a cough.

“Why risk coming? I could turn you over to the Yangs.”

“You won’t.” She smirked.

“Why not? They’d torture you for information.”

“Would you really let others have me?” She leaned closer, breathless. “I’d rather give myself to you.”

Guan Yu’s resolve wavered until noticing her injury. “Who attacked you?”

“Not sure if it’s the Yangs. Barely escaped last night.” She lit a cigarette, surprising him. “I need your help.”

“Why should I? The Yangs are my in-laws.”

Jin Hua’s gaze hardened. “Because Yang Cheng once nearly killed Zhang Han trying to break her seal—the same kind binding your memories. Unlock hers, and you unlock yours.”

Stunned, Guan Yu demanded, “How do you know about my seal?!”

“Your seal was done by Moya of the demon clan. Zhang Han’s mother was half-demon—that’s why her seal matches yours.”

As Guan Yu processed this, Jin Hua added, “Three families allied with Ma Hai plan to destroy the Yangs, then target you and Zhang Han.”

“You exposed her?!” he roared.

“They’d have learned anyway. My goal is eradicating all four families.” Her eyes blazed. “Help me, and you save yourself.”

When Guan Yu asked about Zhang Han’s rumored inheritance, Jin Hua sighed. “The Jins’ wealth once dwarfed theirs. If the seal holds treasure, it’s beyond what those petty clans possess. But breaking it would make Zhang Han a demon hybrid—hunted by all.”

“Then why push this?”

“With you,” she smiled coyly, “we need no treasure. Yang Cheng nearly died forcing her seal. The Yangs lied about his ‘qi deviation.’ They traded Yang Conghan for your Jiezun Sacred Relic.”

Betrayal prickled Guan Yu until Jin Hua delivered the final blow: “Ma Hai and the three families move against the Yangs first. You’re next.”

“Who’s Ma Hai?!”

**Chapter Two Thousand and Seven: She Arrives**

Jin Hua exhaled smoke. “A puppetmaster. And your newest enemy.”

**Chapter Two Thousand and Eight: A Special Cigarette**

As the cigarette’s peculiar scent wafted, Guan Yu realized—this was no ordinary smoke. Jin Hua’s secrets unraveled with every puff, binding their fates tighter than any seal.
