The Right Envoy now hoped that the Eight-Drum Technique would manifest—even if not obtained by her, its emergence through someone else would suffice. That way, she wouldn’t have to remain trapped here, for the Right Envoy had no desire to abandon this dazzling world.

A single day should have passed swiftly, mere hours slipping by. Yet today, everyone nearby felt time stretch endlessly, as if centuries had condensed into one interminable span.

At last, evening arrived. The sun behaved strangely today—by this hour, it should have set, yet half its disc still clung to the horizon as though the day had lengthened.

Even as the sun dipped, the heat remained oppressive. The scorching sands could fry an egg; no one dared stand upon them.

Then, a crimson cloud materialized in the western sky. Bathed in the sun’s dying rays, it painted the heavens red, casting the desert below in a rosy glow.

Gradually, the red shifted to gold. Guan Yu and his companions stepped forward, awestruck by the spectacle.

The entire desert now shimmered under a golden mantle, as if they stood in an ocean of gold.

Siqi exclaimed, “Wow! This view is breathtaking! If only we could capture this moment! Now I feel these two days of roasting were worth it.”

**Chapter 4607: The Portal**

Guan Yu stood pensively. Their wooden sandals protected them from the heat, but others lacked such fortune. Though the sands glittered like gold, no one ventured out.

So this was the origin of “Beneath the Golden City”—the fleeting sunset clouds had transformed the land into a gilded spectacle, as if preordained.

Guan Yu marveled at the beauty but knew bloodshed would soon follow. How many would perish in Miao City tonight?

Nearby observers gaped in wonder, but the Red Lotus Sect faced dire straits. Many suffered heatstroke or burns, with no means of treatment. Their plight stemmed from Elder Zhao’s reckless order to march under such conditions.

Had they stayed put, this disaster might have been avoided. Now, some writhed in delirium, even attacking others.

Though the temperature had slightly dropped, the sands still radiated blistering heat. No one wished to move.

The desert’s golden splendor lasted mere minutes before fading. As the last vestige of light vanished, a flash like a meteor streaked across the distant sky.

“Something’s happening over there!” Siqi pointed left. “Could Miao City have appeared?”

Xiaomei rushed over. “Why are you still here? The portal to Miao City is open! Hurry—time is short!”

“No need to rush,” Guan Yu said calmly. “A city can’t vanish quickly. Let’s gather our things.”

As they prepared, the Soul Demon Sect’s members stampeded toward the light, abandoning camels and tents.

Xiaomei urged, “I won’t wait! The portal might close. Did you think the whole city would materialize? It’s just an entryway!”

“A portal?!” Guan Yu frowned. After all their preparations, they’d expected the city itself. “Leave everything. We’ll proceed lightly.”

Among their sixteen, casualties were inevitable. Guan Yu’s priority was securing the Eight-Drum Technique, but protecting Siqi, Wang Jun, and Aze was paramount.

Leading his sect brothers forward, Guan Yu noted Xiaomei had already vanished. Their alliance had ended.

Approaching the portal, they heard clashing weapons and saw spells illuminating the night. Guan Yu halted. “This isn’t the best time to approach.”

From a dune, he observed the massive, translucent portal—over ten meters wide—amidst chaotic battles. Even the battered High Mountain Sect arrived, barely recognizable.

The Red Lotus Sect, Soul Demon Sect, and True Sun Sect clashed. Elder Zhao and Red Lotus elites had already entered the portal, followed by the Soul Demon Sect’s Right Envoy and her captains.

**Chapter 4608: Observation**

The True Sun Sect fumed. After aiding the Red Lotus against the Soul Demon Sect, their allies had abandoned them. Now trapped fighting alone, they summoned a defensive shield through protracted incantations.

“Soul Demon lackeys!” their elder shouted. “Your leaders are gone! Cease this futile battle!”

The plea worked—without commanders, the Soul Demon disciples faltered. Seizing the chance, the True Sun Sect slipped into the portal.

Wang Jun grew anxious. “Guan Yu, shouldn’t we enter? Others might claim the technique first!”

“The early bird doesn’t always win,” Guan Yu replied. But it was time. Approaching the portal, they faced Soul Demon guards.

“Brothers of the Soul Demon Sect!” Guan Yu called. “Has the Right Envoy arrived? She summoned us to aid her!”

“Who are you?” a guard challenged.

“I’m Guan Yu! The Right Envoy requested my help—or do you defy your Young Master’s ally?”

Recognition flickered. “The Right Envoy entered already. Wait here.”

“Fool!” Guan Yu barked. “We’re from the Heterodox Sect, her allies! If she’s in danger, can you bear the blame?”

The guard wavered, fearing the Young Master’s wrath. Guan Yu pressed, “Use your head! Would the Azure Cloud Sect send so few? Let us pass!”

**Chapter 4609: A Helping Hand**

The guard relented, and Guan Yu’s group advanced. The portal’s glow bathed them as spells erupted nearby. True Sun members, having escaped earlier, were long gone.

Guan Yu assessed the chaos. “Steady. We move as one.”

They slipped through the luminous threshold, the desert’s heat replaced by an eerie chill. Miao City awaited—and with it, the Eight-Drum Technique’s secrets.
