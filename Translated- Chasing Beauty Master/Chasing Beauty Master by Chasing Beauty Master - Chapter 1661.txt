“But now that things have come to this, Ling Su felt he must devise a proper solution. Ultimately finding no alternative, he sought out Lin Chen.

‘Is there truly no other way to resolve this matter?’ Ling Su asked with an ingratiating smile as he approached Lin Chen.

Lin Chen had been in his room counting gold coins, assessing how much remained from their savings. He’d considered that if enough was left, he might indulge in some leisure. Upon seeing Ling Su enter, he hastily concealed the coins—wealth should be kept hidden. This Ling Su was utterly unreliable; if he discovered where the gold was stored, he’d surely seize it without hesitation.

Lin Chen glanced at Ling Su and scoffed, ‘What now? Weren’t you brimming with unyielding pride earlier? You claimed not to fear even First Seat Dai, let alone our master. Weren’t those your own words?’

‘I was merely saving face before our martial brothers! Surely you didn’t take that seriously?’ Ling Su offered an apologetic smile. ‘Siqi intends to return to the Yunqing Sect—I never anticipated this! Can’t you think of a way to persuade her? Let’s just say I was wrong, alright?’

‘“Say” you were wrong? You were wrong to begin with!’ Lin Chen glared at Ling Su, irritation rising. ‘Let me make this clear: The only way to appease Siqi now is for you to apologize and explicitly acknowledge your faults. There’s no alternative.’

‘I can’t go to her now—it’s impossible!’ Ling Su wrung his hands. ‘Think about it! If I approach her, she’ll recoil at the mere sight of me before I utter a word. Why don’t you intercede on my behalf? I’ll admit my mistakes through you!’

‘I’ve met shameless men before, but none as brazen as you!’ Lin Chen snapped. ‘I never realized you’d sink this low. You create a mess, then expect me to clean it up?’

Yet Ling Su’s willingness to humble himself was unprecedented. Lin Chen pondered—to prevent Siqi’s departure, he’d have to attempt mediation, though success remained uncertain.

‘Come now, between brothers like us, must we split hairs?’ Ling Su chuckled. ‘When I’m in trouble, you should help!’

‘Very well. For our bond’s sake, I’ll assist this once,’ Lin Chen relented. ‘But mark this: I’m preserving your dignity now. If you continue ignoring my counsel, don’t blame me for washing my hands of you. I warned you earlier—this mission has just begun. Opportunities will abound. Why provoke conflict now? Siqi’s renowned as the Ice Goddess. She requires patience—haste ruins all. Heed my advice: keep your distance henceforth. If you repeat this folly, I’ll offer no further aid.’

Throughout this lecture, Ling Su absorbed nothing, resentment simmering beneath his compliant expression. How could Lin Chen be so unbrotherly over trivial matters?

Feigning contrition, Ling Su smiled. ‘Understood! I’ll obey you henceforth. Just ensure Siqi stays through tomorrow, and all will be well.’

Lin Chen nodded grimly. ‘I’ll try. No guarantees.’

Meanwhile, Guan Yu stood outside Siqi’s door where it stood ajar, conversing with her. Noticing Lin Chen’s approach, he shifted topics: ‘Siqi, Senior Brother Ling Su didn’t act maliciously. Please reconsider. Our desert mission desperately needs your guidance. Could you stay for my sake?’

‘I’ve no wish to leave,’ Siqi replied, ‘but Ling Su crossed all bounds. Anticipating greater dangers ahead, withdrawal seems prudent.’ Her words, coordinated with Guan Yu, were meant for Lin Chen’s ears.

Earlier, their discussion had involved Guan Yu advising Siqi on subsequent maneuvers. Now turning, Guan Yu addressed the newcomer: ‘Senior Brother Lin Chen! Perfect timing. Siqi insists on departing tomorrow. How should we proceed? Our mission crucially requires her desert expertise. Without her, we’re doomed.’

Lin Chen sighed. ‘This is Ling Su’s fault—his impulsiveness knows no bounds. Siqi, I come to apologize on his behalf. He recognizes his error but clings to false pride. Please find forgiveness this once.’

His earnest tone reflected Guan Yu’s earlier emphasis on Siqi’s indispensability. Damn Ling Su’s recklessness! In the Yunqing Sect, none dared provoke the Ice Goddess under First Seat Dai’s protection. Away from sect constraints, Ling Su’s audacity had swollen—but since Siqi chose this performance, they’d play along.

Chapter 4344: Strained Camaraderie

‘As a woman,’ Siqi declared, ‘I must safeguard my dignity and safety. Prevention outweighs regret.’

Lin Chen glanced helplessly at Guan Yu, who obliged: ‘Siqi, Ling Su erred gravely. But I vow you’ll stay—without your guidance, we’ll perish in the desert before reaching Miaocheng. Though shocked by his conduct, I guarantee he’ll never transgress again. Should he, I’ll invoke the Golden Scale’s authority to expel him. Forgive us this once.’

Guan Yu bowed deeply, his conviction so palpable even Siqi nearly believed her own grievances. Lin Chen marveled at his persuasive prowess—this voluntary atonement for Ling Su was extraordinary.

Collecting herself, Siqi sighed theatrically. ‘For your and Senior Brother Lin Chen’s sakes, I’ll relent. Let this incident dissolve. But Guan Yu—one more offense, and you must honor your word.’

‘Absolutely,’ Guan Yu vowed. ‘Master entrusted me the Golden Scale to discipline wayward disciples. Next transgression, I’ll exile Ling Su.’

As Siqi nodded approval, Guan Yu turned to Lin Chen: ‘My gratitude for aiding this reconciliation.’

‘No need,’ Lin Chen replied stiffly, unsettled by their sudden camaraderie.

Siqi added, ‘I overheard your rebuke of Ling Su at dinner. Thank you—but don’t let this strain your friendship.’

‘Worry not,’ Lin Chen assured, warmed by her acknowledgment. ‘Ling Su’s actions warranted censure.’

Ironically, Ling Su’s blunders had drawn Siqi closer to him—a silver lining in this debacle. With crisis averted, Lin Chen returned to report success.

‘Did you convince her?’ Ling Su pounced. ‘Is she staying?’

‘I practically groveled,’ Lin Chen glared. ‘Only through silver-tongued persuasion did the reasonable Ice Goddess relent. But cross her again, and you’re beyond salvation.’

‘Splendid!’ Ling Su beamed as if crisis had never occurred. ‘All troubles vanish now!’

Lin Chen claimed full credit, dismissing Guan Yu’s role. ‘I exhausted every argument. Siqi fears your harassment—she loathes you now! Do you grasp her revulsion?’

Ling Su shrugged, indifferent. Infuriated by his ingratitude—not even a thanks, unlike Siqi’s courtesy—Lin Chen warned coldly: ‘Next offense, you’ll be expelled, not her.’

‘You threaten me?’ Ling Su sneered. ‘I wasn’t raised on empty menaces!’

‘You’d test Guan Yu’s authority? He wields the Golden Scale! Defy him, and you’ll face expulsion or combat. Recall how he struck First Seat Xiang twice! Even Master yields to him.’

Ling Su paled. Guan Yu’s fearsome reputation and the Golden Scale’s mandate were undeniable. ‘Keep away from Siqi,’ Lin Chen pressed. ‘Next provocation, neither Dai nor Guan Yu will spare you.’

‘Enough nagging! I’ll manage,’ Ling Su snapped, preparing for bed.

Lin Chen concealed his satisfaction—Ling Su’s exile from Siqi’s proximity created opportunities for himself. Their rapport had visibly warmed.

Later, Guan Yu lingered at Siqi’s door. ‘They call you the Ice Goddess—hardly speaking for days. Doesn’t silence burden you?’

Chapter 4345: Unanswered Questions

Lin Chen’s fury ignited. ‘You ungrateful cur! Have you forgotten your groveling pleas? Like a dog you came! And now this insolence?’

‘Gratitude?’ Ling Su laughed mirthlessly. ‘Does it fill bellies or quench thirst? Our transaction’s concluded—why pretend courtesy?’

Bitterly amused, Lin Chen recognized Ling Su’s ruthless pragmatism. Where others repaid kindness, Ling Su discarded allies like used tools.

‘Very well,’ Lin Chen spat. ‘Handle future troubles alone. Remember my warning—persist in harassing Siqi, and Guan Yu will exile you with the Golden Scale’s might. Even Master couldn’t shield you then.’

‘Who? Guan Yu dare expel me?’ Ling Su slammed the table. ‘That whelp lacks the spine! Master himself appointed me!’

‘The Golden Scale overrules all,’ Lin Chen reminded. ‘Guan Yu answers to none—not even First Seat Xiang escaped his blows. Cross him, and you’ll learn true consequence.’

Ling Su’s bravado faltered. Within the sect, his status offered protection. But Guan Yu, wielding the Golden Scale, operated beyond conventional hierarchies. Even Master Xuanming deferred to his judgments.

‘Steer clear of Siqi,’ Lin Chen reiterated. ‘Her patience wears thin, and Dai’s protection extends beyond sect walls.’

‘Enough! I’ll exercise discretion,’ Ling Su growled, lying down. As Lin Chen feigned disapproval, inner triumph surged—with Ling Su marginalized, Siqi’s favor leaned his way. Ling Su’s recklessness had unwittingly served him.

Guan Yu’s voice carried through Siqi’s door: ‘They say you’re made of ice—silent for days. Doesn’t solitude torment you?’”
