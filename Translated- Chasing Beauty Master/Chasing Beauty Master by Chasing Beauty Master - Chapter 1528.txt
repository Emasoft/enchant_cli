“At this moment,” Guan Yu said, “the emperor’s decree has thrust Your Highness into peril. Though your journey to the capital will be fraught with danger, mastering the means to preserve your life is not impossible. If you heed my counsel, endure hardship, and learn swiftly, I believe you will reach the capital safely.”

Though Guan Yu’s words bordered on insolence, all present knew the emperor’s decree had indeed placed the prince in this dire predicament.

The original edict had not specified the reason for summoning Prince Zou, leading many to assume it concerned succession—a matter never easily resolved.

“Let us all sit,” the prince said calmly. “This matter requires careful deliberation. Since we have come this far, haste will serve no purpose.”

Guan Yu was surprised by the prince’s composure. He had a plan to ensure the prince’s escape, but after witnessing the loyalty of those willing to die for him—likely due to past favors—he deemed his scheme feasible.

Zou Wuxiao stepped forward. “Your Highness, remaining trapped here is futile. Allow me to lead a charge and gauge the enemy’s strength.”

“That would be a pointless sacrifice,” Guan Yu retorted, pointing at him. “Your forces arrived hastily at dusk, while the enemy has been preparing since dawn. Archers lie in wait. In this fog, you’d be riddled with arrows before glimpsing their shadows.”

The prince now regretted ignoring his subordinates’ earlier advice to retreat from the bamboo forest’s edge and return at dawn. Their current plight might have been avoided.

“Do you have a better solution?” the prince asked bluntly. “And why should I trust you?”

Guan Yu met his gaze. “Trust is your choice, Your Highness. I cannot compel it. I offer a plan, but its acceptance rests with you.”

The prince weighed his options. This youth might truly be his salvation. With no alternatives, he resolved to listen.

Zou Wuhui, however, bristled. “Audacious peasant! How dare you address His Highness so!”

The prince raised a hand, silencing her. “Enough. Why do you aid us, sir?”

“To right an injustice,” Guan Yu replied plainly. Before departing, Xuan Ming had sternly warned him to conceal his identity as a disciple of the Yunqing Sect—a secret to be guarded even unto death.

Hiding his origins was simple enough, provided no one probed deeply or investigated. These strangers knew nothing of him.

“What payment do you demand?” the prince asked, assuming silver motivated this “chivalrous” aid.

“None,” Guan Yu said with a cold smile. “Not all men crave wealth. I tend my gardens, crops, and livestock here. Silver holds little use for me.”

The prince frowned. Silver he could provide, but Guan Yu’s refusal complicated matters. What costly demand might follow?

“What then do you seek?”

“I’ve said it—I act on principle. To demand rewards would betray ulterior motives. Our meeting is mere chance.”

Impressed by such selflessness in crisis, the prince’s resolve strengthened. “Then I thank you. But what is this plan of yours?”

“It requires sacrifice,” Guan Yu said, glancing around. “The enemy tracks you by sound amidst the fog. We must create chaos—divide into three groups to confuse their archers. Amidst the disorder, you’ll escape.”

The prince nodded. “A sound strategy, but at grave cost.”

“Necessary,” Guan Yu pressed. “Rearguard fighters will likely perish, but there’s no alternative.”

Zou Wuhui interjected, “If silence is key, why not slip past them quietly?”

“Impossible,” Guan Yu countered. “A full company cannot traverse bamboo without noise. The fog amplifies every sound—a snapped twig brings death.”

Zou Wuxiao growled, “Then what? We can’t charge blindly nor wait here!”

“We advance strategically,” Guan Yu explained. “Send decoys with firecrackers to mask your retreat. The commotion will let a small group escape unseen.”

As debates raged, the prince raised his hand. “Calm yourselves. Panic breeds folly.”

Guan Yu bowed. “Your composure honors you, Your Highness. Three teams will strike different directions. When the enemy scatters, we’ll spirit you away.”

Zou Wuhui knelt. “Let me lead the rearguard. Brothers, safeguard His Highness!”

The prince’s voice softened. “This may be our final parting.”

“You raised me from childhood,” she said fiercely. “I gladly repay that debt with my life.”

Zou Wuya, their eldest brother, objected. “The rearguard is my duty. Third Sister, you must protect him.”

As they argued loyalty, two figures entered—Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun, Guan Yu’s allies—bearing sacks of firecrackers.

“Enough debate!” Guan Yu urged. “We move now. Survivors regroup at Lianzhou crossroads at dawn.”

The prince hesitated. “But that route leads back the way we came.”

“Precisely,” Guan Yu said. “Your intended path is anticipated. Retreat disarms them.”

With time pressing, the prince acquiesced. Three teams mounted up, firecrackers in hand. At Guan Yu’s signal, explosions shattered the night as decoys charged. Through the chaos, the prince’s small band slipped away.

Zou Wuya rode through fog, arrows whizzing past. When fireworks faded, he found himself surrounded. A arrow grazed his helm, unhorsing him. As enemies closed in, he recognized their garb—mercenaries, not imperial troops.

Survival meant exposing the conspirators: likely the princes vying for the throne. But first, he had to live...

The ambush unfolded as predicted. While decoys drew pursuit, Guan Yu’s group navigated hidden paths. Behind them, clashes echoed—each strike buying the prince precious time.

“Your Highness,” Wang Jun murmured, “we cultivators flew here by sword. No mortal sentry could detect us.”

The prince noted their uncanny arrival but held his tongue. Questions about Guan Yu’s true identity could wait. Survival came first.

At dawn’s brink, battered remnants gathered at Lianzhou crossroads. Of thirty, eight remained. Zou Wuya was not among them.

“We press on,” the prince said, masking grief. “His sacrifice demands it.”

Guan Yu nodded. The game of thrones had claimed its first pawn—but not the last.
