“Senior Brother Sect Leader, you can’t say that,” Lu protested stubbornly. “Though this magic artifact of mine carries traces of demonic aura, those are merely remnants from its previous owner. The artifact itself has no consciousness. Once a new master claims it, the residual evil qi will dissipate. How can you claim yours is superior?”

Xuan Ming retorted with equal fervor, “This Soul-Falling Blade of mine is a relic preserved from the divine-demon wars of antiquity! Though it was once wielded by a mere foot soldier during that primordial conflict, its power cannot be underestimated. Fewer than ten treasures remain from that cataclysmic era—and this is one of them.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu found himself more drawn to the blade. At the very least, carrying such a massive weapon while traveling would grant him an imposing presence akin to Second Only To Wolf. Though the blade’s appearance lacked refinement, its practical value shone through—suitable for close combat yet capable of channeling magic at range. The pitch-black metal, of unknown origin, radiated an aura of indestructible solidity.

Lu pressed his case: “Don’t underestimate this Sky-Scorching Furnace! Everyone knows demonic artifacts surpass human craftsmanship. Their race’s inherent physical and magical superiority allows them to forge implements beyond mortal capabilities. This furnace was created by a master of the Demon Imperial Clan—its prowess is extraordinary!”

Their rivalry left Guan Yu in a dilemma. He schemed silently, calculating how to claim both treasures despite the near-impossible odds. These elders guarded their artifacts like cherished lovers—merely displaying them was already a grand gesture. Receiving one would require eight lifetimes’ worth of virtue; obtaining both seemed unthinkable.

“Grandpas,” Guan Yu feigned helplessness, “if you continue this stalemate, claiming both artifacts are equally magnificent, how can I possibly choose? You must elaborate on your respective treasures’ unique merits.”

**Chapter 3130: The Final Choice**

Xuan Ming adopted a paternal tone: “Guan Yu, for your safety and comprehensive development, I advise choosing my Soul-Falling Blade. As a novice cultivator, using Lu’s demonic artifact risks qi deviation through demonic backlash.”

“Should Guan Yu select my artifact, he becomes my disciple!” Lu interjected. “I’d safeguard him day and night—your concern is unnecessary, Senior Brother.”

“Disciple Lu, your very argument supports my position,” Xuan Ming countered. “Under my tutelage, he’d receive superior guidance. Moreover, this blade’s versatility in close and ranged combat aligns perfectly with his needs—was this not your earlier assertion?”

Guan Yu now realized why Xuan Ming had withheld the blade during Lu’s earlier display of the Solar Yang Sword—the sect leader had been reluctant to part with it until now.

“Let the boy decide,” Lu declared, approaching Guan Yu with the furnace. “The choice is yours. Further words are pointless.”

Guan Yu nodded gravely, stealing covetous glances at the swirling dark energies surrounding the furnace. How he wished to simply seize it!

“Whichever path I choose today, know I’ll remain your devoted disciple. Should I ever break these seals and regain my Realm Sovereign power, I’ll aid either of you unreservedly.”

His honeyed words moved both elders. Xuan Ming sighed, “With such promises, our purpose is fulfilled. Choose freely—we’ll bear no resentment.”

Guan Yu mentally scoffed. Once these artifacts were his, future obligations could wait. Who knew if he’d even be reachable after regaining his true power?

Tears welled in Lu’s eyes. “Child, you’ve spoken this old man’s heart. Such understanding of elders’ wishes...”

Guan Yu smiled innocently. “Why not let me apprentice under both? Grandpa Xuan could teach magic while Grandpa Lu instructs cultivation techniques. Wouldn’t this ideal solution avoid hurting either’s feelings?”

He watched their reactions keenly—dual mentorship might secure both treasures. When their silence stretched too long, he backtracked: “Forgive my greed, but your virtues make choosing unbearable. I merely wish to spare one grandpa’s heartache.”

“The idea has merit,” Xuan Ming conceded, “but dual apprenticeships invite ridicule. One cannot have two masters—it violates ancestral traditions.”

Guan Yu feigned enlightenment. “Grandpa Lu... what of our earlier discussion about sworn brotherhood?”

Both elders instantly grasped his implication. Lu nodded slowly. “Your earlier pledge suffices. Should you choose Senior Brother, we’ll still become oath brothers.”

Snatching the Soul-Falling Blade from Xuan Ming’s grip, Guan Yu pretended concern at the elder’s pained expression. “Grandpa Xuan seems reluctant. Should I return this and choose the furnace?”

“No!” Xuan Ming forced a smile, though parting with the blade felt like losing a lover. “This artifact is yours. Cultivating ties with a future Realm Sovereign outweighs material loss.”

Guan Yu pressed his advantage: “As Grandpa Xuan’s disciple, shouldn’t my ‘Grandpa’ Lu still teach me cultivation? Residing at Front Return Peak facilitates this.”

Lu’s eyes lit up—hosting a Realm Sovereign at his peak offered immeasurable prestige. Gritting his teeth through the agony of loss, he blurted: “Our bond transcends formalities! Take the Sky-Scorching Furnace too!”

Guan Yu snatched the furnace before Lu could reconsider. “Eternal gratitude, Grandpas!” He stashed both treasures with glee.

**Chapter 3131: Formal Apprenticeship**

Lu stared at his empty hands, mentally berating his impulsiveness. Xuan Ming gaped—his junior had carried that ancient furnace for centuries!

“Possessing multiple supreme artifacts at your current level invites danger,” Lu desperately cautioned. “Best store them with us, keeping just one.”

“Grandpas wouldn’t reclaim gifts, would you?” Guan Yu chided, making both elders flush with shame. “I’ll guard them carefully. Now, how do I formalize my apprenticeship?”

Xuan Ming sighed in defeat. “A simple kneel and tea offering suffices for a nominal disciple. Remember—our sect upholds righteousness. Never harm the innocent.”

As Guan Yu knelt, he mused wryly: So begins my cultivation journey. The lukewarm tea Xuan Ming forced down mirrored the elder’s bittersweet acceptance.

**Chapter 3133: Transgression**

Soaring above Cloud Azure Mountain’s peaks with Lu, Guan Yu admired the sect’s sprawling majesty. “Where does Elder Jiu reside?”

“Guardian of our sect’s deepest secrets in the rear mountains,” Lu explained, detouring around restricted flight zones. Circling westward, they landed at a bamboo forest bordering Tiger’s Head Peak.

“Is this the rear mountains?” Guan Yu eyed the trodden path through fallen leaves.

“Not yet. Beyond lies restricted airspace—we proceed on foot from here.”

“You frequent this route to visit Elder Jiu?”

“Occasionally. Why?”

“The path appears well-used.”
