“Hmm, there’s no need for you to remind me of that. Little Brother Guan Yu isn’t a fool. In this current situation, he wouldn’t dare lie to me, right?” Lang Tianhun spoke, suddenly turning his gaze toward Guan Yu. Though a faint smile lingered on his face, his tone carried an undercurrent of threat.

“Your words are most wise, Senior. However, if I simply divulge everything now, it seems rather unfair to me. How about this—let’s exchange information…”

Before Guan Yu could finish, he noticed Lang Duhua frantically blinking at him, as if warning him to watch his words.

Yet this subtle detail did not escape Lang Tianhun’s notice. He glared at Lang Duhua and snapped, “It’s not your turn to speak yet. Must you always resort to petty gestures?”

Lang Duhua stuck out her tongue sheepishly after being reprimanded.

“I know you used this very method with Lang Duhua earlier, extracting much information about our War Wolf Mercenary Group from her. You’re indeed shrewd, young man. But such tricks won’t work on me!”

“Senior, there’s no need for anger. What I propose is actually advantageous to you. I’ll answer all three questions you just asked, and in return, you need only answer one of mine. How does that sound?”

Lang Tianhun pondered briefly before replying, “Very well. Speak first.”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected Lang Tianhun to let him take the lead, but the order mattered little. In the end, he’d only get to ask one question.

“Where is Locke now?”

Lang Tianhun, seemingly anticipating this, showed no surprise. “He is currently under the protection of our War Wolf Mercenary Group. Do you intend to move against him?”

“Senior, does that count as answering my question? If so, I’ll respond just as vaguely later. So…”

“Little Brother Guan Yu, one must possess self-awareness. Otherwise, great misfortune may follow. Understand?”

“I do. Thank you for the warning, Senior. Still, I hope you’ll clarify. I know Locke is with your group, but where exactly? To my knowledge, the War Wolf Mercenary Group has a headquarters and several branches, correct?”

“‘To your knowledge’?” Lang Tianhun frowned, casting a sidelong glance at Lang Duhua. “You’re new here. How could you know this? Or did someone tell you?”

“I deduced it myself. An organization as vast as yours couldn’t possibly operate from a single location,” Guan Yu explained quickly.

“Hah! How astute, Little Brother Guan Yu. Indeed, we have both a headquarters and branches. I’ll tell you this—this is merely a branch. Our headquarters lies far away, where our leader resides.”

“So Locke is at this branch?”

“Yes. Does this answer satisfy you, Little Brother Guan Yu?”

“It’ll suffice. I know pressing further won’t yield more. Best to quit while I’m ahead. Now, let me address your earlier questions.”

Guan Yu paused, collecting his thoughts. “First, I am indeed human. But the first friends I made in this world were elves. Without them, my cultivation path would’ve been far harder. They’ve aided and encouraged me greatly. For them, I hold eternal gratitude.”

“I see. So you’re a man of loyalty and sentiment. Had you first encountered our War Wolf Mercenary Group, things might’ve unfolded quite differently, no?”

“Perhaps. Now, the second matter. I seek Locke because I require him for a task. If you assist me by handing him over, I, Guan Yu, swear friendship with your group and pledge not to harm his life. Refuse, and the consequences… even I cannot predict them.”

“Do you think such words are wise to utter before me?”

“Hey, are you insane? Can’t you stop interrupting when my boss is speaking? It’s downright rude!”

Bikao the cat, ever hot-tempered—especially when his master was threatened—snarled the retort.

But Bikao seemed to forget that among the War Wolves sat Lang Tianming, a youthful hothead. Hearing the cat’s words, he stormed forward. “What’s this? My second brother and Guan Yu are humans talking. What’s a stray cat doing butting in? Scram!”

“I ain’t scrammin’! Wanna fight, punk?”

“Fight it is! I’ve long wanted to teach this beast a lesson!”

As Bikao and Lang Tianming’s quarrel escalated toward violence, Guan Yu made no move to stop them. As Bikao’s master, he understood the cat’s temper. Moreover, in this tense standoff where direct conflict was unwise, letting Bikao vent might demonstrate their resolve.

“One final question—is the elven princess with you?”

“If I guess correctly, you heard this from Locke himself?”

“Does it matter who said it?”

“Senior, you overlook a crucial point. Do you know what crimes Locke committed in the Elven Forest?”

“What crimes?”

“As captain of the Elven Forest guard, he abused his prodigious talents to openly challenge the Elven Chief’s position. To seize power, he even colluded with humans, seeking profit amidst chaos.”

Lang Tianhun remained silent, gesturing for Guan Yu to continue.

“Cooperating with such a man—do you truly believe your group stands to gain?”

“Your words hold merit. Yet I must say—you gravely underestimate the War Wolf Mercenary Group’s strength. Locke’s schemes are child’s play in my eyes. No threat at all.”

“Very well. If that’s your stance, I’ve nothing more to add. As for your third question—the so-called elven princess isn’t with me. Thus, we’ve nothing further to discuss.”

“Oh? Little Brother Guan Yu, have you never heard the saying ‘A wise man knows when to yield’?”

“Of course. But I also know another saying.”

“Which is?”

“When pushed beyond endurance, endurance ends.”

Lang Tianhun stared, then burst into booming laughter.

“Splendid! The boldness of youth! So you refuse to negotiate in good faith?”

“Before saying that, reflect on your own actions!”

Guan Yu’s words thickened the air with tension. All present readied for battle. Bikao heightened his vigilance—this was their strongest foe yet, their most perilous encounter.

“How about this—let’s make an exchange!”

“Didn’t we already trade information?”

Lang Tianhun shook his head. “True. But since that’s done, let’s trade something else.”

“What?” Guan Yu asked warily.

“People.”

“Boss, don’t agree lightly! This guy acts mild, but he’s rotten inside!”

Guan Yu shot Bikao a sidelong glance. “Even a fool could see that. What I need now is a plan. Must we truly fight to the death?”

“Boss, what do you think he means by ‘trading people’?”

“Isn’t it obvious? He wants us to exchange Amy for Locke!”

“What?! We can’t agree to that!”

Guan Yu nodded grimly. “Of course not.”

As Guan Yu and Bikao whispered, Lang Tianming barked impatiently, “What’s all the muttering? Didn’t you hear my second brother? Answer plainly—agree or not?”

“Senior, I don’t quite grasp your meaning regarding this ‘exchange’...”

“Oh? How could someone as clever as you fail to understand?”

As they spoke, a voice suddenly rang from afar.

“Dragon Brother!”

Hearing this, Guan Yu’s heart sank. Lang Tianhun smirked coldly. “No explanation needed now. If I’m not mistaken, this girl is the elven princess I mentioned?”

“She’s no princess! Just an ordinary elf!”

“Dragon Brother, what are they talking about?” Amy asked, running to Guan Yu’s side.

“I told you not to come out! Why didn’t you listen?”

“I just wanted to see you! Why are you so angry?”

Guan Yu struggled to explain the danger to the oblivious Amy. Bikao interjected urgently, “Boss! They’re moving!”

Guan Yu whirled to see the wolfmen fanning out, preparing to encircle them.

Though wary of the others, Guan Yu focused on Lang Tianhun—the true threat.

“Boss, what now? We could escape, but what about Amy?”

This was precisely Guan Yu’s concern. Had Amy stayed hidden, their odds—though slim—would’ve been better.

“We’ve no choice. I’ll handle Lang Tianhun. You take Amy and fight the rest. Escape at the first chance!”

“But...”

Noting Bikao’s hesitation, Guan Yu pressed, “Problem? Should we switch roles?”

“It’s not that… Boss, you know his power. Facing him could be fatal!”

“What alternative do we have? Wait here to die?”

Seeing Guan Yu’s resolve, Bikao said no more, grabbing Amy’s hand to flee.

Once they’d bolted, Guan Yu sprinted in the opposite direction—hoping to split their pursuers’ attention.

But Lang Tianhun saw through the ploy instantly. He led the chase, hounding Guan Yu relentlessly.

Never had Guan Yu fled so desperately. After over an hour of exhausting flight, just as he thought he’d shaken them, a shadowy mass loomed ahead.

Before Guan Yu could react, darkness swallowed his consciousness.

**Chapter 1437: Amnesia**

Chenzhou Village, a small settlement in the Blue Beauty Continent, housed over four hundred souls—80% surnamed Chen.

Living simply, rising with the sun and resting with its setting, the villagers knew little of the wider world. But this peace wouldn’t last.

One dawn, as the sun crested the horizon, a youthful voice called out:

“Grandpa, wake up! Time to eat!”

The voice belonged to a man in his twenties, though it carried a childlike lilt. This was Guan Yu.

A month had passed since his unconscious arrival. Stripped of memory, he believed himself a child of eight or nine. An old man had taken him in as a grandson.

A raspy cough answered. “Cough… Guan Yu, eat first. Grandpa isn’t hungry.”

Instead of obeying, the boy scrambled up the courtyard’s locust tree with practiced ease.

“Grandpa’s asthma is acting up again. If only I had money for a proper doctor…”

Though young, his face bore a determination beyond his years. Gazing at distant peaks, he mused:

Chenzhou lay encircled by mountains, accessible only through a treacherous, rain-slicked pass between two smaller hills—a secluded world unto itself.

Grandpa had once spoken of secrets within the tallest peak. To Guan Yu, this made perfect sense. The village seemed a speck compared to that colossal range.

His deepest wish was to conquer that mountain—not for glory, but to find a cure. In his memory, Grandpa had always been ill. If he lost his only family…

A tear slid down his cheek—not from fear, but frustration.

Parentless, Guan Yu had endured years of bullying. Village children taunted him as a foundling. Grandpa’s silence on the matter only deepened the mystery.

“Hmph! Grandpa’s hiding something!” he muttered, careful never to voice this aloud.

Who were his parents? Why was he here? Were they even alive?

The questions brought a headache. A child’s mind shouldn’t bear such weight.

“Focus on Grandpa’s health first. If he recovers, maybe he’ll tell me everything!”

A cough interrupted his thoughts.

“Cough… Little one, climbing again? You’ll fall!”

Guan Yu slid down the trunk like a squirrel—a skill honed over three years.

“Grandpa! Come eat before it’s cold!”

Eager to avoid scolding, he dashed inside to serve breakfast.
