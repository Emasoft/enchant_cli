Cao Jin's fist wind struck the thick iron wall, imprinting a palm mark that revealed his formidable strength and ruthless approach.

After Guan Yu dodged the attack, Wei Hongwei, Yang Conghan, and others broke into cold sweat for him—that had been dangerously close.

Cao Jin launched relentless assaults, yet Guan Yu's elusive movements defied prediction. Determined, Cao Jin closed in for close-quarters combat.

Guan Yu's continuous evasion without counterattacks infuriated Cao Jin, who interpreted this as mockery. Halting his attacks, Cao Jin glared.

At that moment, Guan Yu struck back. The audience watched as a miraculous egg-yellow shield instantly enveloped his entire body.

Cao Jin stared bewildered at Guan Yu's flickering figure. Without hesitation, he unleashed a powerful strike toward Guan Yu.

A surge of energy shot toward Guan Yu, but upon touching the eggshell-like barrier, the shield trembled slightly, reflecting the attack back.

Proving his prowess, Cao Jin swiftly dodged the rebounding energy with a sideways flip.

The crowd gasped. "A shield that reflects damage? This is cheating!"

"It's over. The match might as well end now."

"That guy from Kaihuang is insane! What kind of shield is that?"

Many spectators speculated Guan Yu relied solely on his flashy shield without real combat skills, deeming him inferior to Geying in both defense and offense.

Guan Yu admired his Eggshell Shield, noting its hue had faded slightly since last use.

With the shield's reflection ability, Cao Jin dared not attack recklessly. He sought close combat, but Guan Yu's erratic movements denied him any opening.

In truth, Guan Yu feared no close engagement. From their first exchange, he had recognized Cao Jin's inferiority. Ending the fight swiftly would have been easy, but Guan Yu chose restraint to avoid excessive attention. "As the saying goes, 'Fame fears the strong,'" he mused, wishing to evade unnecessary trouble.

Seizing an intentional flaw Guan Yu left exposed, Cao Jin lunged forward. Guan Yu, having deciphered his patterns, prepared to conclude the battle.

Their clash intensified. Guan Yu focused on blocking, feigning vulnerability to lure Cao Jin into overcommitting before delivering a decisive blow.

On the platform, Amei buried her face in Xue Jing's arms, too terrified to watch. Xue Jing, aware of Guan Yu's true capabilities, calmly reassured her. "He's toying with his opponent. Victory was always his."

Chapter 1900: Berserk Transformation

As the match neared its end, Guan Yu exploited Cao Jin's momentary lapse to deliver a non-lethal blow to his abdomen. Cao Jin spat blood, collapsing meters away. Just as the referee rose to declare Guan Yu's victory, an unforeseen transformation occurred—Cao Jin levitated, bones crackling as his body expanded grotesquely.

Guan Yu retracted his shield, stunned. The once frail Cao Jin now towered with Huanqiao-like musculature, eyes blood-red and veins bulging.

"A Berserker!" someone screamed.

Berserkers—rare mutants capable of explosive power amplification—were typically state-controlled assets. Triggered by rage, Cao Jin's latent berserker blood had awakened.

Though temporarily invincible, berserkers faced severe post-transformation exhaustion. Yet in this moment, Cao Jin radiated primal fury, craving combat.

Roaring, he teleported before Guan Yu, delivering a thunderous punch that sent Guan Yu crashing into the iron wall. The crowd gasped as Guan Yu barely suppressed a mouthful of blood.

Realizing brute force wouldn't prevail, Guan Yu relied on speed. Reactivating his shield, he dodged Cao Jin's meteoric dropkick that dented the reinforced wall.

Yang Conghan urged Xue Jing: "Should we forfeit?"

Xue Jing shook her head. "This is his battle. Interfering would dishonor him."

Chapter 1901: Victory

As Cao Jin's sonic roar battered the trembling shield, Guan Yu realized reflection had failed—the attack neared the shield's limit.

Vanishing from sight, Guan Yu moved at blinding speeds. To ordinary eyes, he disappeared; experts barely tracked his afterimages.

In their climactic clash, Guan Yu feinted, redirecting his kick to stomp Cao Jin's skull. When the berserker retaliated with a desperate headbutt, Guan Yu channeled golden energy into his palms, unleashing a radiant shockwave.

The dual strikes pinned Cao Jin against the wall. Collapsing, the berserker reverted to his original form—unconscious, battered, and destined for prolonged recovery.

Chapter 1902: The Fool

The audience erupted in thunderous applause, electrified by the unprecedented duel. Even the dazed referee finally announced: "Guan Yu of Kaihuang Academy...victorious!"

Amidst the cheers, Amei sobbed into Xue Jing's embrace, while the victor gazed calmly at his fallen foe. This battle—etched into every witness' memory—proved that sometimes, the greatest strength lies not in frenzy, but in measured brilliance.
