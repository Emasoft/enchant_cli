As Kaili was dragged along by Guan Yu for dozens of meters, she suddenly wrenched her hand free. "Let go! Release me!"

"What's wrong?"

Kaili stopped to glare at Guan Yu, then glanced at the dazed Young Astrologer in the distance. "Big Brother Guan, what's going on between you and the Young Astrologer now? I feel like you've got some ambiguous connection with every girl in our elven tribe!"

Guan Yu shook his head with a faint smile. "You exaggerate! At least there's nothing between you and me..."

Most girls would blush at such teasing, but Kaili merely sneered. "Save your breath. I only want an ordinary man who can protect me. A great philanderer like you who saves thousands of women across time isn't worth my notice!"

Guan Yu knew Kaili bore prejudice against him – though truthfully, anyone without prejudice here would be abnormal. He didn't mind her sarcasm. This was better; if every woman flirted with him, he'd be overwhelmed. The current few were already enough trouble!

"Enough of this. Who told you I'd left Elvenwood?"

Kaili rolled her eyes. "Who else? Rossi!" She sighed. "Who knows what charm you possess? Before meeting you, Rossi was a vivacious beauty. Now she mopes about like resentful housewife."

"Oh... I see." Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly. That kiss must have deeply affected her. But now wasn't the time for promises – everything could be settled after helping the elves eliminate that rotten apple Locke.

"What happened to your clothes? They're in tatters after just days apart. I'm impressed you can still flirt dressed like this!"

Only then did Guan Yu notice his singed garments – though the flames had been extinguished, the damage remained. Remembering how he'd teased the Young Astrologer earlier, he suddenly found the situation absurd.

When Guan Yu fell silent, Kaili didn't pry. Matters of the heart confused her, and she cared only for studying magic to become a formidable woman like the Grand Astrologer.

They walked in silence for half an hour before Kaili pointed at a path. "Through here lies the Great Hall. I've matters to attend."

The so-called Great Hall was the massive tilted banyan tree – both the political heart of elvenkind and second only to the sacred Isle of Life in importance.

Approaching familiar steps, Guan Yu saw the assembled crowd in the hall as if waiting for his arrival. No guards hindered him this time. Entering the council chamber, he bowed to Patriarch Allen. "Guan Yu greets the Patriarch."

Chapter 1253: Rock-Paper-Scissors

Though pleased, Allen's expression held more disbelief than joy. That Guan Yu could return unscathed after a week on the Isle of Life was astonishing – and potentially problematic.

As predicted, a man at the end rose first. Surveying Guan Yu's appearance, he sneered, "Did bandits attack you, Young Master Guan? Even beggars wouldn't wear such rags. This hardly befits a dragon clan heir!"

Undoubtedly Locke – Guan Yu's archnemesis among elves. Though few encounters had occurred, their enmity now demanded blood.

Guan Yu laughed heartily. "How astute! Though I met no beggars, vicious hounds plagued me for days. Their barking still echoes as I entered!"

The assembly watched this clash between elven guard captain and dragon noble, knowing intervention helped neither side.

"Enough!" Allen interjected. "Young Master Guan, your return honors Elvenwood. Please refresh yourself first."

As Guan Yu turned to leave, a white-bearded elder spoke: "Wait. I've questions needing answers."

Guan Yu inwardly cursed the colluding old fool and young scoundrel. "Ask away," he said through gritted teeth.

The elder pressed: "All know you left Elvenwood abruptly days ago, only to suddenly return. What game do you play?"

"I love this place as second homeland. Satisfied?"

The elder faltered at Guan Yu's brazen lie. Another voice challenged: "Mountain sentries report no outsiders entered Elvenwood these days. Did you fly here, Young Master?"

Guan Yu sighed at the greasy middle-aged interrogator. "Must I endure this farce just to bathe?"

When silence followed, Locke rose triumphantly: "Recent rumors mention the Fruit of Life—"

"Enough!" Guan Yu roared. "One question only! Let you three decide by rock-paper-scissors who asks!"

Tension dissolved into chuckles. As patriarch, Allen couldn't interfere – elven law required council consensus, with majority votes even able to depose him. Guan Yu's quick wit again eased pressure.

The three opponents flushed crimson. Rock-paper-scissors in solemn council? What mockery! Yet refusal meant losing answers.

"Mark my words," Locke growled. "You'll learn whom to cross. Defying me means death!"

Guan Yu shrugged off the threat, further infuriating the proud captain. Under protest, Locke, Elder Kyle, and the greasy man played the childish game – to uproarious laughter. Through opponents' intentional losses, Locke "won."

"Well?" he snapped.

Guan Yu smirked. "Reluctant? I needn't answer."

Locke mastered his rage. "Where were you these days – Elvenwood or Isle of Life?"

"That's two questions."

The crowd groaned at Guan Yu's trickery. Though frustrated, elders found entertainment in their dull routines.

Locke rephrased: "Did you visit the Isle of Life?"

Guan Yu paused dramatically before asking innocently: "What... is the Isle of Life?"

Game over. Leaving baffled interrogators behind, Guan Yu departed to bathe.

After luxurious washing and rest, Guan Yu awoke at dusk. Contemplating the tranquil woods, he yearned for family in his original world. Facing dangers alone wore on him.

Chapter 1254: A Touch Simple-Minded

"Dragon Brother, are you there?"

Speak of companionship... Guan Yu scrambled into fresh clothes, trousers half-fastened when Amy appeared, blinking owlishly.

"What are you doing, Dragon Brother?"

"Getting dressed. Can't you see?"

Amy nodded.

"Then why watch? Little simpleton..."

"I'm not little!"

Guan Yu marveled at the patriarch's eccentric daughter – unfazed by "simpleton" but indignant at "little." Dressing quickly, he sat as Amy rushed over.

"Dragon Brother! I heard how you humiliated Locke! Whenever I argue with him, I lose. You avenged me!"

She shook his arm gleefully. Guan Yu smiled bitterly – to her, this was mere quarrel, not deadly feud.

"Why dislike Locke? He treats you well."

Amy tilted her head. "Don't know. Just dislike him. His kindness feels false."

Guan Yu nodded approvingly – surprisingly mature perspective for her age.

Coughing, he ventured: "Do you... like Dragon Brother?"

"Of course!" she beamed.

"How much?"

"Enough to marry you when I grow up!"

Guan Yu choked. "You know what that means, little one?"

"Means having babies! I'm not afraid! And don't call me little!"

Her logic amused him – willing to bear children but not endure nicknames. Such contradictions existed only in her innocent world.

Suddenly pulling him up, Amy declared: "Take you somewhere fun!"

Guan Yu followed through growing noise to discover... an amusement park! Carousels, slides, wooden Ferris wheels – even water rides. Elven ingenuity rivaled human creations.

"Like it?" Amy glowed with pride.

Nodding, Guan Yu watched elflings dart about. This was the idyllic paradise of childhood dreams.

"Big Sister Amy! Play with us!" begged a tiny elf.

Patting the child, Amy asked Guan Yu: "Won't you join?"

"Too big. Explore instead."

Disappointed but obedient, Amy warned: "Come back later!"

Watching her play elder sister to the children, Guan Yu's heart stirred. This naive girl transformed into nurturing guardian. Shaking his head, he chided himself for being charmed.

Venturing down a quiet path, Guan Yu encountered a massive circular wall. Hearing activity beyond, he climbed a tree to peer over – and gasped.

Thousands of elves filled an immense training ground. "Their practice arena," he murmured. Such numbers explained elven dominance – thousands of mages comprised formidable force.

"Who's there?!"

Hundreds of eyes turned upward as Guan Yu froze.
