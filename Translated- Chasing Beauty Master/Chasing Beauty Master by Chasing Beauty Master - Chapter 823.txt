“Ah Mei didn’t overthink. She would never lie about anything. Just as she was about to speak, Xue Jing, standing nearby, interrupted. ‘Ah, Guan Yu, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll go cook for you,’ Xue Jing said.

‘Oh right, I’ll prepare the dishes,’ Lü Mei added hastily, sensing the tension, then followed Xue Jing out.

As Lü Mei scurried past Guan Yu like a thief, he uttered softly, ‘Stop.’ He turned and grabbed her arm, leaning close to her ear with a mocking tone. ‘During my absence, it seems Miss Lü of the Vaughn family has changed quite a bit? Even venturing into the kitchen now?’

Lü Mei, visibly afraid of his reproach, stammered, ‘Ah? Um, actually, I was just going to help Sister Jingjing. Hehehe…’

‘Ah Mei, answer my question,’ Guan Yu straightened up, fixing his gaze on her. Ah Mei now realized that telling the truth would anger him, yet she couldn’t bring herself to lie.

After an internal struggle, she confessed, ‘We usually stay up playing games until around one, sometimes even until dawn. Hanhan once played for two days and nights without rest.’

Ah Mei’s trembling words turned Lü Mei’s face ashen. She glared at Ah Mei as if wanting to devour her, mentally cursing her as a brainless fool.

‘What did I tell you before I left? Did you take all my words as a joke?’ Guan Yu’s voice carried a hint of anger, immediately reducing Ah Mei to tearful sobs. His single reprimand had already shaken her deeply.

But this matter demanded a stern lesson. Even with Ah Mei crying, he couldn’t let it go.

Guan Yu continued, ‘Do you still consider me your man? How could you treat your bodies like this? How could you do this to me? While I’m away worrying about you, you’re here harming yourselves?’

‘Guan Yu, I was wrong. I’m sorry, Sister Jingjing, Sister Lü Mei…’ Ah Mei wept, apologizing to Guan Yu for her mistake and to the others for revealing the truth.

‘Jingjing, come out,’ Guan Yu called toward the door, knowing Xue Jing had hidden outside instead of going to the kitchen.

Xue Jing entered, her face equally guilty. ‘We weren’t really as Ah Mei described. We rarely stay up that late. It’s always Hanhan dragging us into playing, that’s why…’

To deflect blame, Xue Jing pinned everything on Zhang Han, who wasn’t present. This wasn’t entirely false—among the four, Zhang Han was the most gaming-obsessed, often keeping the others up late. Even after returning to the Yang family, her habits remained unchanged.

Seeing Lü Mei’s increasing distress and glancing between her and Xue Jing, Guan Yu softened. ‘Enough, don’t cry. I’m not blaming you—I’m worried about your health. If you don’t care for yourselves, you’re not caring for me. You can play, but rest properly. Understand?’

He embraced Ah Mei, gently wiping her tears. Among them, she was the most timid and fragile, needing the most protection.

After comforting them, Guan Yu took a long bath, washing away days of tension from remaining hyper-vigilant in the forest’s dangers.

That night, he shared Zhang Han’s large bed.

The next morning, Guan Yu’s first task was visiting the Yang family. Letting Zhang Han stay there posed risks.

‘Old Master Yang, how’s your health lately?’ Guan Yu greeted courteously. By etiquette, as Yang Conghan’s husband, Yang’s patriarch should be his grandfather too. However, due to Guan Yu’s status, they maintained formal titles—his own insistence.

‘Guan Yu, it’s been a while. I’m touched you remember this old bone,’ Yang’s patriarch chuckled.

Yang Conghan was absent, and Zhang Han was likely gaming. She’d surely bounce out upon hearing of Guan Yu’s arrival.

‘I’ve been away handling matters… What a pity.’ Guan Yu hinted at his recent endeavors, aiming to remind Yang that he’d saved the family heir’s life and that the Boundary Sovereign Sacred Bead used for that could’ve aided another friend now.

Old Master Yang probed, ‘Speak freely here, Guan Yu. Can this old man assist?’

Guan Yu had awaited this yet couldn’t disclose Uncle Qing’s situation fully. ‘My trip was to help a friend, but I failed. A friend suffers a decade-old serpent venom—a severe case. How I wish for another Boundary Sovereign Sacred Bead…’

Yang’s expression flickered imperceptibly. ‘Indeed, those beads are rare. You saved my son with one—I’m eternally grateful.’

‘It was Master Yang’s fortune and Conghan’s blessing,’ Guan Yu demurred.

‘Still, we thank you,’ Master Yang added.

‘Actually, I’m also here to retrieve Zhang Han. The girls keep clamoring for her return—their noise is splitting my head.’

Old Master Yang paused, reluctant to let Zhang Han leave. Her presence reassured him, given her exposed identity. ‘She’s only just returned. After her long stay with you, let her remain awhile.’

‘It’s no trouble, but the others miss her company,’ Guan Yu pressed.

Master Yang stayed silent until his son interjected, ‘Hanhan’s been gaming nonstop here. Best not burden you further.’

Guan Yu frowned, realizing the Yangs distrusted him. ‘I know Zhang Han matters to your family, but my women’s safety is paramount. Whether Yang rises or falls, Conghan remains mine. I’ll let no harm touch her. Other affairs don’t concern me.’

This declaration shielded both Zhang Han and Yang Conghan from familial conflicts.

Old Master Yang brightened. ‘Your capability isn’t in doubt, but… Very well. Let Zhang Han go. I trust you’ll keep Yang secrets.’

‘Rest assured—no outsider will learn what shouldn’t be known.’

‘Big Brother! Did you bring snacks?’ Zhang Han’s voice chirped as she leaped into Guan Yu’s arms.

‘Plenty at home. Hurry back before your sisters devour them all.’

Pinching her chubby cheeks, Guan Yu noted she hadn’t changed—still adorably plump.

‘Let’s go now!’ She tugged him out after bidding farewell.

At Qiaoyuan District, Zhang Han booted her PC, piled snacks nearby, and forgot Guan Yu’s existence.

Watching the four women resume their gaming obsession, Guan Yu sighed and left. At least they were safe at home.

Next, he sought Qing Ling’er. Her father’s poison deadline loomed tomorrow. That deranged junior sister—using such methods to force his appearance!

Even if she still loved Uncle Qing, he’d rage upon learning what she’d done to Ling’er.

By 5 PM, Ling’er should be off work. Guan Yu headed to Pan Taisheng’s apartment, spotting him arriving in a pickup truck.

‘Guan Yu! Long time! Drink?’ Pan grinned.

‘Sure. I’ll grab provisions.’

‘Forget that—there’s barbecue across the street!’ Pan, already red-faced from drink, dragged him toward a small eatery named Xiao Dan’s Restaurant.

As they walked, Pan slurred, ‘See that place? Let me tell you…’
