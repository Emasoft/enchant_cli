“Old Wang inquired with an air of composure.”

The horse-faced young man nodded. “Correct. Though acquainted with Young Master Hu, to call me his plant would be going too far. I, Ouyang Jian (Sword), haven’t fallen to such depths. Since I’ve already bid for this jade, I shall pay the sum!”

*Truly, his name fits him perfectly!*

Regardless of whether Ouyang Jian was Hu Zongze’s accomplice, Guan Yu found no grounds to object now that someone willingly paid 1.1 billion for a counterfeit. Still, he felt a pang of regret. Strip away the artificially forged blood patina, and the jade itself held considerable value—perhaps not billions, but certainly worth tens of millions.

His original plan to provoke Hu Zongze into selling it for millions now lay in ruins.

Noticing his chagrin, Wen Qing comforted him, “It’s alright, dear. Just a piece of jade. I never truly desired it, especially since it wasn’t the real ‘Eternal Heart’!”

“My wife is the best!” Guan Yu kissed her cheek. “I promise I’ll find the genuine Eternal Heart for you.”

A disheveled man nearby shook his head ruefully. “Easier said than done. Do you know where that jade last vanished? After the tragic lovers’ deaths, Emperor Wanli entombed it with him. When his mausoleum was later plundered, the jade resurfaced decades ago—some say it went to Japan, others claim Chiang Kai-shek took it to Taiwan. Whatever the truth, it’s certainly not on the mainland now. I’d thought this auctioned piece might be the legendary artifact... What a shame it’s fake. To glimpse the true Eternal Heart—I’d die content!”

The man, appearing over thirty with unkempt attire, radiated wistful yearning when mentioning the relic.

Guan Yu introduced himself, “I’m Guan Yu. May I know your name?”

“So you’re Guan Yu! No wonder you’re attracting so much attention. I’m Dongfang Mu (Eastern Wood). Just call me Dongfang.” His casual tone matched his slovenly appearance.

Lin Lin gasped. “You’re *the* Dongfang Mu?”

Puzzled, Guan Yu wondered about the man’s fame.

“Younger Brother Guan, the Dongfang family is an ancient Kyoto clan with deep political, commercial, and military connections,” Lin Lin explained. “Though the Hu family currently leads Kyoto’s elite circles, the Dongfangs eclipse them in true influence. They’re Kyoto’s only family spanning five generations—the patriarch is over a century old!”

Her elaboration left Guan Yu unimpressed. Why such awe for this scruffy heir when she’d shown none toward Hu Zongze?

Noticing his confusion, Lin Lin whispered, “With over a dozen fifth-generation members, the family’s succession remains contested. Dongfang Mu was the fourth generation’s prime candidate... until he rejected the mantle.”

“Why?” Guan Yu found such renunciation incomprehensible.

“He’s obsessed with art! An expert in antiques and artworks, he globetrots visiting museums year-round.”

As they conversed, Dongfang Mu kept muttering lamentations, confirming his single-minded passion.

“Are antiques that profitable?” Guan Yu suddenly asked.

“Profitable?” Lin Lin rolled her eyes. “Every nouveau riche buys artifacts for prestige—most clueless about authenticity. They’ll pay millions for fake calligraphy or vases just to appear cultured.”

Her contempt mirrored encounters with wealthy philistines.

“Then Dongfang Mu must be wealthy indeed?”

Guan Yu contemplated collaboration but doubted the scion would partner with him.

Lin Lin nodded vigorously. “Beyond wealthy! His personal assets alone dwarf multiple national institution directors’ combined fortunes!”

Resigned, Guan Yu shelved partnership plans but resolved to befriend him. “Brother Dongfang, I possess several fine jade pieces. Would you examine them?”

“Jade?” Dongfang Mu hesitated—his expertise lay elsewhere—but finally acquiesced.

Exchanging contacts, Guan Yu received a minimalist business card bearing only “Dongfang mu” and a phone number. *How eccentric*, he mused, pocketing it.

As the gathering waned, Guan Yu prepared to leave with Wen Qing and Lin Dong—until sudden silence gripped the hall.

**Chapter 1012: Song Shaoqin’s Arrival**

Newcomers’ entrance sparked varied reactions—schadenfreude, indifference, concern.

Spotting the leader, Guan Yu narrowed his eyes. “Thought you wouldn’t show.”

“That’s Song Shaoqin?” Lin Dong asked drily.

“The very ‘formidable’ Song heir who terrified my father-in-law into nearly executing me.” Guan Yu shrugged, unimpressed by the average-looking scion.

Lin Dong saw through his bravado. “You’re unworried?”

“Why fret?”

“Then why entrust Wen Qing to me?”

Guan Yu admitted, “Just cautious about her safety.”

Their banter contrasted with Song’s retinue’s scrutiny. A portly youth sneered, “*This* is who beat your uncle? Unremarkable.”

Song remained silent as a girl giggled, “Jia Yan, he’s more complex than you think.”

“Three heads? Six arms?” Gu Jiayan scoffed.

The girl—Mu Xiyan—nodded toward Wen Qing. “See her? Wen Qing, daughter of the National Security Minister, granddaughter of a founding general. His other flames include Li Xi—your beloved goddess.”

“Bullshit! Li Xi wouldn’t...” Gu Jiayan spluttered.

Mu Xiyan continued mercilessly, “Oh, he’s also subjugated Jiang Ziqi—your rival.”

Enraged, Gu Jiayan vowed vengeance until Mu Xiyan added, “Of course, Li Xi barely knows you exist.”

As the group bickered, Mu Xiyan declared her intent to pursue Guan Yu, stunning her companions.

**Chapter 1013: Two Women, One Suitor**

Guan Yu anticipated confronting Song Shaoqin—not being accosted by a vivacious beauty in figure-hugging jeans and a snug tee that accentuated her curves.

Wen Qing pinched him jealously as Mu Xiyan smiled. “You must be his girlfriend? Better guard him tightly—I might steal him.”

“You’ll fail,” Wen Qing retorted, shielding Guan Yu.

Undeterred, Mu Xiyan extended her hand. “I’m Mu Xiyan. May I court you?”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “Court me? We’ve just met!”

“Now we’re acquainted. I don’t mind your existing girlfriends.” She winked at Wen Qing. “More the merrier!”

Wen Qing glared daggers as Guan Yu declined, though secretly lamenting the missed opportunity.

Mu Xiyan persisted, “Marriages dissolve daily—a mere girlfriend’s no obstacle. Unless...” Her eyes sparkled with challenge. “You fear falling for me?”
