“That Dragon Eye Amber is an extraordinary immortal artifact,” Guan Yu said disdainfully. “Aren’t you feeling shortchanged, Master? If so, let’s swap back. These trinkets of yours are useless to me anyway. I’d rather reclaim the immortal artifact.”

Xuan Ming had no recourse against Guan Yu’s attitude. Logically, the exchange for the immortal artifact was fair. Arguing further risked provoking new demands from Guan Yu, leaving Xuan Ming at a disadvantage. With a bitter smile, he remained silent.

Elder Jiu interjected, “Xuan Ming, visit me tomorrow. For now, let’s address Elder Ba and the young lady’s matter. How shall you test her?”

Though Elder Ba yearned to inspect the Dragon Eye Amber, Xuan Ming hadn’t brought it. “Young lady,” he said, seating himself, “attack me freely. Rest assured, I’ll not harm you.” His aim was to gauge Du Bingyan’s capabilities while offering guidance.

“Elder Ba is formidable,” Guan Yu urged. “Wield that Blood Sword with all your strength. This is a rare chance to learn from a master.”

Du Bingyan’s resolve stirred at Guan Yu’s words. Enhancing one’s prowess was every cultivator’s desire.

The lavish gift stunned everyone. Elder Lu’s heart ached witnessing such a prized artifact given freely, while the three elders marveled. Even as sect elders, they’d never casually bestow high-grade magical tools.

Elder Lu seethed inwardly. Guan Yu’s recklessness infuriated him—such a treasure, squandered! Yet, with the bride’s parents, Xiao Zhi and the Zhengs, present, he couldn’t intervene.

Xiao Zhi clapped Guan Yu’s shoulder jovially. “Your generosity honors us, Brother Guan! Such a gift for Little Yan!”

“The sword suits her,” Guan Yu replied. “Besides, it’s clearly meant for a woman. Credit Elder Lu, though—it was his treasure. Thank him, not me.”

Noticing Elder Lu’s pained expression, Xiao Zhi led Du Bingyan to kneel before him. “Our deepest gratitude for this precious gift, Elder Lu.”

Guan Yu had orchestrated this gesture to soothe the elder. Forcing a smile, Elder Lu said, “The artifact was yours to give. My role ended when I passed it to Guan Yu. Your courtesy is acknowledged.”

“Then let us proceed,” Elder Jiu declared. “Young lady, wield your Blood Sword against Elder Ba.”

Another elder, Elder Qi, teased, “Don’t grow complacent, Ba! That’s the legendary Blood Sword she holds. At your age, being bested would shame our Cloud Azure Sect!”

Guan Yu found the elders’ names amusing—Jiu, Ba, Qi—their homophones hinting at absurd numerology. He stifled laughter, wondering who’d devised such titles.

Though terrified, Du Bingyan couldn’t retreat. The crowd’s presence and Elder Ba’s assurance steeled her. After bowing, she drew the Blood Sword. Crimson light flashed as she vanished, reappearing a hair’s breadth from piercing Elder Ba’s heart!

Gasps filled the hall. Such speed! Guan Yu wasn’t surprised—Du Bingyan’s agility defined her Forming the Golden Core from Qi cultivation.

“Impressive!” Elder Ba exclaimed, conjuring a token-like talisman to block the strike. He’d underestimated her. Though the token clanged against the blade, the impact shoved him back.

Du Bingyan pressed her advantage, thrusting at his throat. The elders tensed—had she mastered external Qi projection, the strike would’ve been fatal. Dodging narrowly, Elder Ba retreated, shedding his earlier nonchalance.

Elders Jiu and Qi watched intently. Each of Du Bingyan’s strikes aimed lethally. Only Elder Ba’s expertise prevented defeat. For Xiao Zhi and Xuánzhōng Peak’s honor, Du Bingyan fought relentlessly, determined to prove her worth.

Her blade whirled, painting crimson arcs as she blurred across the chamber. Even seasoned cultivators marveled. Xiao Zhi realized he’d have fallen instantly to such speed.

Elder Ba, a martial fanatic, countered with spiritual energy-enhanced agility. Though lacking internal Qi, his decades studying combat techniques let him parry with a spiritual staff. A strike to Du Bingyan’s leg ended the bout.

“Remarkable!” Elder Ba praised. “Self-taught, yet you’ve reached this level. With proper guidance, you’ll shake the martial world.”

Beaming, Xiao Zhi and the Zhengs bowed in gratitude. Du Bingyan demurred, “My skills are rudimentary.”

Guan Yu smirked. He’d long recognized her genius—a prodigy any master would covet. Yet, becoming her teacher would complicate his friendship with Xiao Zhi. Occasional guidance sufficed.

Elder Qi puffed his gem-encrusted pipe—a peculiar magical artifact. “You held your own against the Blood Sword, Ba. Color me impressed.”

“A warrior’s weapon is part of their strength,” Elder Ba replied. “The test was fair.”

Guan Yu pondered the Blood Sword’s fame. Though he’d gifted it casually, its synergy with Du Bingyan’s talents was undeniable. The scabbard’s spirit-storing gem might go unused, but the blade itself magnified her prowess exponentially.
