“Earlier this morning, a maid from Jiang Xin’s (Heart) side came to report to me, saying their young mistress would come here soon. She also asked me to relay a message: when I see you, I should inform you that Jiang Yuan Kai (Primal Founder) has matters to discuss and requests your presence at his residence. But it’s been hours, and Jiang Xin still hasn’t arrived. I fear something may have happened to her?”

“It couldn’t happen that quickly, could it?” Guan Yu abruptly remarked.

“What do you mean? What couldn’t happen quickly?” Chu Fan (Common Chu) widened his eyes. Guan Yu thought grimly—worries bred reality. Had the Cao Family truly acted so swiftly? If so, they must have been observing her for some time, seizing this chance to abduct Jiang Xin.

“What are you two doing?” A voice called from behind them. Without turning, they recognized Jiang Xin’s lively tone.

“Greetings, Lady Jiang. It seems you’re truly a devoted patron of the Red Beauty Theater,” Guan Yu chuckled, visibly relieved at her arrival.

“Spare the formalities, Wan Hong (Vast). Actually, I came to find you. My father wishes to meet you. He hopes you’ll visit our residence at your earliest convenience.”

“Oh? What business would the Imperial Son-in-Law have with me? I’ve now provoked two great families—the Cao and Qin clans loathe me deeply. Even the capital’s citizens avoid me. Wouldn’t his summons risk implicating him against those houses?”

“I’ve no idea what he wants. My task was merely to deliver the message. The rest is none of my concern,” Jiang Xin replied with a laugh.

Guan Yu nodded. “I’ll make time to pay my respects soon.”

“Chu Fan, didn’t you have something urgent to discuss? Was it merely your excessive concern for Lady Jiang?” Guan Yu turned to ask.

“I wanted to ask about the Qin Family’s movements. I fear they might disrupt tomorrow’s shipment of costly materials. If they strike then, it’ll spell disaster.” Though Chu Fan’s worry had eased upon seeing Jiang Xin safe, his brow remained furrowed.

“Set your mind at ease,” Guan Yu assured. “The Qin Family is too preoccupied with internal strife to trouble us. Their own affairs consume them.”

“What exactly has happened? You seem well-informed,” Chu Fan pressed. Jiang Xin also leaned in curiously, unaware of the Qin’s troubles.

Guan Yu saw no harm in sharing. “Rumors suggest Qu Hua (Splendid Tune), their fisheries manager in the fishing village, embezzled funds. If proven true, Qu Hua won’t escape severe consequences.”

“Such audacity!” Jiang Xin exclaimed. Chu Fan’s expression betrayed muted satisfaction.

“If true, this grants us respite. The Qin won’t harass us for now,” Chu Fan noted.

“Should they seek trouble, it’ll be with me alone. The Red Beauty Theater remains untouched,” Guan Yu stated.

Jiang Xin’s eyes sparkled. “Wan Hong, they say you single-handedly defeated over a hundred Qin guards—including a dozen experts—on the streets! Is it true? I’m beginning to admire you!”

“A mere display,” Guan Yu chuckled. “The Qin’s forces proved laughably weak. A sneeze might have toppled them.”

“Had I not shown mercy, none would have escaped. I spare the innocent needless bloodshed,” Guan Yu added.

“Chu Fan, why not learn martial arts from Wan Hong? Once skilled, you could protect me,” Jiang Xin suggested playfully.

Guan Yu had long recognized Chu Fan’s potential—his natural physique and self-taught inner energy from stage combat hinted at greatness. Yet Chu Fan’s temperament dissuaded him from offering guidance. Even if asked, he’d refuse.

Jiang Xin’s jest unknowingly stung Chu Fan. Her constant praise of Wan Hong grated him. Must he study under this newcomer to earn her regard? The implication that he couldn’t currently protect her fueled silent resentment, though he dared not voice it.

“You’ve demolished the entire theater! How ambitious. I’m eager to see the new Red Beauty Theater rise,” Jiang Xin remarked, aware of Chu Fan’s lifelong devotion to his craft.

“Lady Jiang, the capital grows perilous. For safety, limit your outings. Stay within your father’s estate. If you wish to meet Chu Fan, have him visit you there,” Guan Yu advised, alluding to the Cao Family’s schemes.

“What dangers? All seems calm,” Jiang Xin protested.

“Appearances deceive. Heed caution,” Guan Yu insisted. After her departure, he warned Chu Fan: “Avoid meeting Jiang Xin freely. Forces plot against her.”

“Who’d dare target a royal niece?” Chu Fan gasped.

Guan Yu offered no further explanation. Jiang Xin herself felt unease, realizing she’d ventured out with only two maids and no guards.

Before leaving, she reminded Guan Yu: “Don’t forget to visit Father soon.”

Chu Fan’s anxieties eased regarding the Qin Family’s threat. As they parted, Guan Yu spotted a familiar figure outside a tavern. Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) gasped: “Left Envoy!”

The Demonic Soul Sect’s Left Envoy stood observing them before entering the establishment. Inside, he addressed Guan Yu coldly: “Your clashes with two great houses cast doubt on your ability to protect our Young Mistress.”

“Doubt me? Then guard her yourself,” Guan Yu retorted.

Wang Xiaorong interjected: “We’re safe here, Left Envoy.”

“Superficial safety. Your name draws more than clan enemies—countless seek the East Sea Dragon Pearl’s secrets through you,” the Left Envoy warned. “This tavern belongs to our sect. Use it as refuge if needed.”

Chapter 4906: Retreat Over Valor

Though unmarked, the tavern’s strategic purchase demonstrated the sect’s reach. After the Left Envoy departed, Guan Yu prepared to visit the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence alone.

“We want to see the estate too!” Qiqi protested when excluded.

“It’s unsafe and improper. My reputation suffers if I’m seen relying on women,” Guan Yu reasoned.

“You’re ashamed of us!” Qiqi accused, sparking a quarrel. Wang Xiaorong mediated while Guan Yu struggled to appease her. Ultimately, they remained behind as he ventured forth—into gathering storms both political and martial.
