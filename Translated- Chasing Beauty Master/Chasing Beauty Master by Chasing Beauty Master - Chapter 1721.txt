“So it has come to this,” Mazar muttered. Having promised Ling Su protection, he was determined to keep his word. Moreover, he now considered Ling Su a true friend—and friends stood by each other. Since Ling Su had already made enemies within his own sect, there was no room for hesitation.

“Enough!” Mazar stepped forward, pointing at Guan Yu. “Leave now, or we won’t hold back. Ling Su is our sworn brother here in the Hada Clan. Not a single finger shall be laid on him while he’s under our protection. If you wish to fight, you’ll have to step over my corpse first.”

Ling Su stifled a grin behind them. *Damn it, finally someone’s standing up for me. This feels incredible.*

Guan Yu frowned, baffled at how Ling Su had forged such loyalty from these desert warriors in half a day. Confronting the Hada Clan here would be unwise, yet letting Ling Su slip away gnawed at him.

“This is an internal matter of the Yunqing Sect,” Guan Yu said coldly, his voice laced with menace. “Do you truly wish to interfere?”

An oppressive aura radiated from him, chilling even his companion Siqi. Across from them, Mazar and Hadabei tensed, while Ling Su—despite his drunken bravado—felt a flicker of fear.

Guan Yu’s display of power confirmed he was no ordinary cultivator. Mazar exchanged uneasy glances with Hadabei. Intervening in sect affairs was treacherous, and Guan Yu’s group seemed formidable.

Hadabei turned to Ling Su. “Brother, this complicates things. If this is truly your sect’s internal strife, our involvement may be... improper.”

“Indeed,” Mazar added. “You claimed these were personal enemies, but this seems different.”

Ling Su’s heart sank. *Are these oafs backing out now? Pathetic!*

“Brothers, this isn’t about me—it’s about your honor!” he declared. “These outsiders trespass on Hada territory. Drive them out so we may resume our drinking!”

Mazar brightened. “True enough! We welcome no outsiders here. Settle your sect quarrels elsewhere. But while Ling Su remains under our roof, we protect him. Leave now!”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. The Hada Clan’s stance was clear: they’d shield Ling Su here but wouldn’t pursue matters beyond their borders. Reluctantly, he conceded. Provoking desert dwellers on their turf was folly.

“Ling Su,” Guan Yu spat, “consorting with outsiders? The sect will hear of this. Hide here forever, or face punishment!” With that, he led his group away, casting one last glance at the mysterious wooden tower.

Ling Su exhaled in relief. Guan Yu’s threat lingered—he’d need to deal with him permanently before returning to the Yunqing Sect. For now, he reveled in his temporary victory.

As they resumed drinking, Ling Su sighed dramatically. “When will I gain enough strength to crush these bullies?”

Mazar frowned. “You’re fellow disciples. How did this feud begin?”

“A woman.” Ling Su’s voice turned bitter. “The Yunqing Sect stands as the righteous pillar of the cultivation world. I was Tiger Head Peak’s top disciple, beloved by our master. Siqi—the sect’s foremost beauty—and I were considered destined partners... until Guan Yu arrived.”

He described how Guan Yu had seduced Siqi during his absence on a mission, bribing her with rare treasures. “By the time I returned, they’d... consummated their relationship. When I challenged him, his magical artifacts overwhelmed me.”

Hadabei stroked his beard. “Why pursue the Eight-Sided Drum Technique here?”

Ling Su feigned surprise. “You know of it?”

“Rumors say it lies within Miao City,” Mazar said. “But locating anything in this desert is folly. Last year, the Jiayi Sect lost hundreds to that cursed place.”

“Yet Guan Yu seeks it,” Ling Su pressed. “If I claim it first, I could redeem myself. The technique’s four volumes supposedly grant dominion over the martial world. We can’t let the Demonic Soul Sect obtain them!”

Hadabei shrugged. “We care little for cultivation manuals. But the Jiayi Sect raids nearby villages tomorrow. Join us if you wish.”

Ling Su’s eyes gleamed. “Gladly!” To demonstrate his worth, he flicked a wrist. Lightning shattered a human-faced fruit tree outside.

Mazar winced at the loss but nodded approval. “Impressive. Let’s see that power against the Jiayi dogs!”

As night deepened, Ling Su nursed his wine, mind racing. *The Hada Clan’s aid could secure the technique... and Guan Yu’s demise.*

**Chapter 4502: Rumors**

Guan Yu marched his disciples through the dunes, frustration simmering. Ling Su’s interference had cost him rest and intelligence about Miao City. Now, tracking the Demonic Soul Sect’s trail was his only lead.

“That snake charmed the Hada Clan somehow,” he muttered. “Probably bribed them. No matter—we’ll find Miao City first.”

**Chapter 4503: Rumors**

“The verses about Miao City are lies!” Mazar laughed as Ling Su gaped. “Spread by the Jiayi Sect to lure the greedy. Even if you find it, the Eight-Sided Drum Technique may not be there.”

Ling Su’s drunken haze lifted. “But last year, a volume surfaced in Meng Hua the Ancestor’s tomb! The others must appear this year.”

Hadabei shook his head. “Miao City’s guardians are monstrous. Last July, Jiayi lost three hundred men there. Seek glory elsewhere, brother.”

Ling Su clenched his cup. *Guan Yu will take the risk. So must I.* Aloud, he sighed. “Without that technique, I’m doomed. But helping you against Jiayi tomorrow is honor enough.”

Mazar clapped his back. “Rest now. Dawn brings bloodshed.”

As the Hada warriors retired, Ling Su stared into the desert night. *Jiayi’s defeat will earn their trust. Then... Miao City.*
