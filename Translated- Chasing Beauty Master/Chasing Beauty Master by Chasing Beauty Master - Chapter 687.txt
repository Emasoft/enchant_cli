Living day after day in the villa while guiding the cultivation of Hayakawa Shigeru, Sakurako, Hou Jinshun, and Xue Jing, Guanyu found his life remarkably fulfilling. As for Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan, neither wished to pursue cultivation, burdened as they were by numerous responsibilities. Guanyu did not press the two women, content to prolong their lives through elixirs and spiritual energy, ensuring their companionship for years to come.

Over a month of tranquility passed. One day, as Guanyu meditated in his bedroom with Xue Jing nearby, the young girl—who had long harbored ardent feelings—persistently clamored to become his true wife. Though teased by others as a “little nympho,” she remained unbothered, her determination unwavering.

Liu Shilei had returned to Y City to resume her duties as principal of Mingyang High School, while Sun Xiaoya continued teaching there. Liu feared leaving the school unattended lest unscrupulous individuals target it. Meanwhile, Xue Jing clung to Guanyu daily. Despite the presence of alluring beauties like Du Xiaojuan, Sakurako, and Ouyang Yihan, Guanyu found no opportunity to act on his desires. His pent-up frustration inadvertently accelerated Hou Jinshun and Hayakawa’s cultivation progress through rigorous training.

Through her persistent cultivation beside Guanyu, Xue Jing had developed water-attribute spiritual energy. During meditation, she became enveloped in a halo of pale blue light, resembling an ethereal fairy encased in a crystal orb—radiant beyond compare.

Were it not for her tender age, Guanyu might have long succumbed to his urges. Yet at merely nineteen, he restrained himself, unwilling to cross that line.

Suddenly, Guanyu’s eyes snapped open mid-cultivation. Retrieving a glowing orb from his robes—the Illusory Heaven Pearl—he observed its surface shimmering inexplicably, despite having left it dormant for weeks. Simultaneously, Xue Jing’s placid blue aura turned turbulent, as though summoned by the pearl’s light.

A flash emanated from the orb, projecting Earth’s phantom image. Unlike before, no ancient voice spoke—only a map materialized, its northernmost point illuminated. Guanyu recognized the Arctic. In the Five Elements cosmology, the north corresponded to water, represented by the Black Tortoise. The pearl’s reaction to Xue Jing’s supreme water-attribute energy confirmed their connection.

Xue Jing awoke from meditation, sensing her dantian’s energy roiling under the pearl’s pull. Attempting to rise from the sofa, she found herself paralyzed, unable to speak—her wide eyes locking onto Guanyu in alarm.

Guanyu shook his head reassuringly. Grasping the pearl, he perceived its urgent directive: journey north. Had Xue Jing’s power matured enough to harness the Arctic’s Primordial Essence?

As the thought formed, the pearl’s glow dimmed, Earth’s image vanishing. The orb reverted to an ordinary golden sphere in his palm. Freed from paralysis, Xue Jing leaped into his arms, tapping the pearl petulantly: “You bad ball! Are you trying to scare me to death?”

Whether coincidence or fate, He Wugang’s report of Arctic anomalies aligned with the pearl’s guidance. Resolute, Guanyu decided to depart immediately with Xue Jing.

Releasing his divine sense, Guanyu left mental messages for all, announcing their Arctic quest. Clasping Xue Jing’s hand, he soared through the window into the night sky.

Mid-summer’s warmth enveloped them as they glided above the capital. Below, Kyoto’s streets pulsed with light and life—a flowing tapestry of humanity and vehicles. Guanyu gazed fondly: *This is the world I protect. Though its people lack strength, their spirit is indomitable. I vow to safeguard this land.*

Channeling spiritual energy, he formed a protective barrier around them, accelerating northward.

Xue Jing marveled at her maiden flight, echoing Sakurako’s earlier wonder. She exclaimed at drifting clouds and landscapes below. Guanyu maintained moderate speed, one arm around her—inwardly tormented.

Despite her youthful appearance, Xue Jing’s mature physique pressed against him as she squirmed excitedly. Half a month’s abstinence and her deliberate obstruction of his liaisons with others had left him strained.

“Could you... keep still?” Guanyu rasped, bodily reactions intensifying.

Provoked, Xue Jing wriggled deliberately. “Why? I’m happy! Does my moving bother you? Hmm... Did you hide an electric rod in your pants?”

Overcome, Guanyu pulled her across his lap, delivering playful swats. “Imp!”

“You won’t touch me yet block others!” Xue Jing retorted, clinging to his thigh. “I’ll be fourth wife at worst! It’s unfair—we met first, yet that teacher became third!”

Guanyu sighed at her fixation. Though nineteen and legally adult, her father Xue Yingfeng tacitly approved her affections. Yet Guanyu hesitated, fearing her feelings stemmed from hero-worship rather than maturity.

Contemplating the Five Primordials, he wondered—would each require a woman of supreme elemental affinity? Xue Jing (water) and Sakurako (wood) fit this pattern. Three more—metal, fire, earth—might await. The prospect daunted even him; legendary prowess notwithstanding, he was no Yellow Emperor bedding thousands.

Ignoring Xue Jing’s teasing, he quelled his arousal through meditation. Sulking, she cursed his “cowardice” before drowsing against him as Russia’s vast fields unfolded below.

**Chapter 1747: Arctic Guardian**

A formidable aura surged earthward. Guanyu stiffened, jostling Xue Jing awake. “What? Won’t kiss me but shakes me?” she grumbled.

“We’ve company.”

“Here? Who else flies like you freaks?”

A cyan streak approached—a wood-attribute cultivator. Guanyu mused: first Japan’s fire-aligned Ito, now this Russian. Were single-element practices common outside his omni-attuned path?

The hulking figure—nearly seven feet tall and burly—halted before them. “Greetings! You must be Guanyu of China. I am Ivanov. Sensing an aerial expert, I came to investigate.”

Guanyu noted Russia’s swift response—tracking his supersonic trajectory and deploying Ivanov within minutes. Post-“Divine Realm” returnes like Ivanov bolstered national strengths, yet their synchronized emergence puzzled him.

“Which Divine Realm did you enter?” Guanyu inquired.

Xue Jing whispered, “He’s so fat!”

Ivanov chuckled. “Once as lean as you, young sir. Wood-attribute cultivation enhances vitality—and weight.” To Guanyu: “I emerged three days prior from a Pacific island realm. Other nations remain unaware.”

Xue Jing gasped. “Will Sakurako get fat too? That’d be tragic!”

Guanyu suppressed a grimace. Redirecting, he mentioned their Arctic mission. Ivanov declined, citing adjustment needs after two decades in the “demon world.”

Noticing Ivanov’s abrupt coolness upon discussing the Divine Realms’ Mandarin usage, Guanyu’s suspicions deepened. Why did all realms employ Chinese? How did the Illusory Heaven Pearl’s ancient voice know the language eons before its existence?

Post-farewell, they descended near Arctic outposts—human garrisons monitoring local anomalies. Guanyu recalled Commander He Wu’s briefing: international rotations guarded these sites, though China focused on African realms.

Landing miles from the nearest base, they prepared to seek the Primordial Essence—a secret Guanyu guarded jealously, even from his own nation. The Arctic’s mysteries awaited.
