**TRANSLATED TEXT:**

Wen Qing exclaimed in surprise, "Even my grandfather hasn't met Guan Yu yet. How could he place such high hopes on him?"

“Heh, why not bring that lad to meet the General when you have time? Then you’ll know,” Li Yun replied without directly answering Wen Qing, instead making a light-hearted joke.

Wen Qing’s cheeks flushed as she whispered, “Let’s wait until the timing is right.”

“What you consider immature timing might already be ripe,” Li Yun said with a meaningful smile.

Wen Qing blinked playfully, staring at Li Yun in confusion.

“Uncle Li, just tell me—why has my grandfather taken such a liking to Guan Yu?” She tugged at Li Yun’s arm, suddenly acting coquettish.

She realized her grandfather must have had significant interactions with Guan Yu. When Guan Yu disappeared, her grandfather had mobilized resources far beyond her expectations to search for him. Now, he’d even sent his personal secretary to oversee the matter, deepening her astonishment.

Li Yun glanced at two other men nearby and lowered his voice. “The General’s orders include not only finding Guan Yu but also delivering a message: it’s time for him to take you to meet the General!”

Wen Qing froze, staring at Li Yun in shock. Her grandfather wanted to meet Guan Yu? Panic flickered in her heart. Unlike Mo Ling, gaining her family’s approval for Guan Yu would be difficult—yet her grandfather already knew everything.

Li Yun observed her reaction, sighing inwardly. He grew curious about Guan Yu’s charm, which had captivated Wen Qing.

“The helicopter’s back—they must have found something.”

Wen Qing turned abruptly, eyes fixed on the approaching helicopter. Tension hung thick as the aircraft landed, revealing a disheveled, shirtless figure—Guan Yu.

“Honey!” Wen Qing rushed forward, embracing him.

Guan Yu’s scarred torso told tales of hardship. “I’m here now,” he murmured, soothing her.

“Was it Jiang Ziqi?” Wen Qing pressed.

Guan Yu’s smile turned cold. “Who knows? But whoever did this will pay.”

The reunion was emotional. Mo Ling and Zhao Jing’er wept, relief washing over them.

“Let’s go home,” Wen Qing urged.

Guan宇 carried Gao Wei, still unconscious, back to the villa.

Guan宇’s return brought tears of joy to the villa’s women. After settling Gao Wei and freshening up, a familiar chirp echoed through the room.

A sleek black bird with snow-white claws landed on Guan宇’s shoulder—Xiao Hei (Little Black).

“How did it survive the toxins?” Guan宇 marveled, recognizing the bird he’d rescued.

Xiao Hei nuzzled him, radiating familiarity. Using his healing system, Guan宇 channeled energy into the bird, eliciting joyful chirps.

“You’re still after my energy, huh?” Guan宇 chuckled, wary of repeating past exhaustion.

Xiao Hei’s intelligence charmed the women, though it mischievously tangled Mo Ling’s hair, sparking laughter.

Xiao Hei’s presence fascinated everyone. Its agility and disdain for touch amused the group, especially when it playfully dodged Mo Ling.

“This bird’s too clever!” Mo凌 exclaimed, half-annoyed, half-amused.

Guan宇 smiled, sensing the bird’s unique bond with his energy—a mystery yet to unravel.
