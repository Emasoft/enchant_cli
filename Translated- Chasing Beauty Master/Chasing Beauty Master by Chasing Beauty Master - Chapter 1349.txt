“This is nothing,” Xiao Zhi chuckled. “A man’s room being this messy is perfectly normal. A Ze hasn’t even lived here long. You’ve no idea how it was back at Xuanyun Peak…”

“Xiao Zhi, must you keep blabbering? Do you really want my embarrassing habits known to the whole world?” A Ze groaned, scratching his head. “Apologies—I’ll clean up right away.”

“Pfft, there’s no one else here. Everyone already knows your quirks. No harm in mentioning them now,” Xiao Zhi retorted with a smirk.

A Ze was notoriously lazy about tidying. While he always dressed sharply when going out, his living space resembled a warzone. He’d wear every piece of clothing until all were filthy before finally washing them.

Siqi wrinkled her nose in dismay. “How do you even live like this? It’s practically a garbage dump!”

Flustered by her teasing, A Ze hurriedly gathered the clutter. Guan Yu laughed. “A man’s space being messy is understandable. A Ze, it’s high time you found a woman to take care of you.”

“Guan Yu, don’t shift the topic by mocking me!” A Ze protested, torn between laughter and exasperation.

“I’m serious. A woman’s influence would curb your habits. Having someone tidy up for you is natural.”

Eager to escape the conversation, A Ze grabbed a teapot. “I’ll fetch hot water to brew tea!” He darted out.

Earlier, A Ze had meant to clean his room before inviting the others, but Qin Taijin’s injury had distracted him.

Seated around the table, Guan Yu remarked, “With Qin Taijin injured and most guards stationed at his quarters, the manor’s defenses are lax. If Steward Sun is truly suspicious, he’ll act tonight.”

“Who in Qujiang City would dare attack Brother Qin?” Xiao Zhi wondered aloud.

“Not necessarily locals,” Guan Yu said, recalling Qin Taijin’s arrogance at Echo Pavilion. “Someone from outside might’ve struck him. With so many outsiders here for Duobao Mountain—especially Demonic Sect members—they wouldn’t care about his family’s status.”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “Qin’s used to bullying others. Arrogant fools like Yue Jing deserve a beating.”

Siqi frowned. “Guan Yu, aiding the City Lord’s Manor against the Red Lotus Sect today felt wrong. They’re fellow righteous cultivators. Weakening them only helps the Demonic Sect.”

“True,” Guan Yu conceded, “but Yue Jing and Lai Lixia made cooperation impossible. Keeping such ‘allies’ is pointless.”

“I agree,” Xiao Zhi added. “Their actions disgust me more than the Demonic Sect’s.”

A Ze returned with steaming water. “I checked Qin’s room earlier—guards are packed outside! The kitchen’s boiling chicken soup on Lady Qin’s orders, ready the moment he wakes.”

“A noble’s plight keeps the whole household on edge,” Guan Yu mused.

“Did you see Steward Sun?” Xiao Zhi asked.

“No. Maybe he’s waiting outside Qin’s room too.”

“Unlikely. With so many servants there, the steward wouldn’t linger. Let’s extinguish the lamp and wait.”

As they sipped tea, Siqi abstained, disliking the bitter aroma. Xiao Zhi produced his Black Ingot, channeling spiritual energy into it fruitlessly.

“Is that thing broken?” Guan Yu teased.

“No. My father must initiate contact from his end. He’s probably… ‘shut off,’ as you’d say.”

“‘Shut off’?” The others stared blankly. Guan Yu waved dismissively—explaining modern terms was futile.

Suddenly, the Black Ingot vibrated. A glowing square of light materialized above it, revealing Sect Leader Zheng’s hazy image.

“Whoa, video calls with vibration? Insane,” Guan Yu muttered.

“Father! We’ve news,” Xiao Zhi said, updating him on the Red Lotus Sect clash.

Sect Leader Zheng frowned. “The Red Lotus are allies. Sun Lianzi will hold grudges. Be cautious.”

“We’re not afraid of them,” Guan Yu argued. “But they’d hinder our mission.”

“Avoid further conflict. Sun Lianzi schemes in shadows. Focus on Duobao Mountain—the Demonic Sect’s gathering suggests their plan nears fruition.”

Xiao Zhi mentioned Steward Sun’s suspicious activities.

“Meddling in household affairs is unwise,” Sect Leader Zheng warned.

“We’ll only investigate his motives,” Xiao Zhi assured.

After the call, Guan Yu muttered, “Best keep secrets from the sect. Demonic spies infest Cloud Azure.”

“Movement outside!” A Ze hissed.

Guan Yu blew out the lamp. Peering through the window, they spotted a shadowy figure by the garden rockery—too tall to be Steward Sun. The man emitted eerie, fox-like howls.

“That’s the sound I heard before!” A Ze whispered. “It’s a human mimicking a fox!”

Siqi trembled, accidentally kicking the door. The figure whirled—eyes blazing crimson in the dark.

“Holy shit! Fire eyes?” Guan Yu gasped.

Siqi screamed as the figure vanished, leaping away with what seemed like multiple tails.

“My fault…” Siqi whispered.

“It’s fine,” Guan Yu soothed, noting her uncharacteristic fear.

Another figure approached the rockery—Steward Sun, scratching his head in confusion before leaving.

“That’s our man. We’ll bunk in my room tonight. Siqi, you don’t mind?”

She shook her head. “I’ll meditate.”

Back in darkness, Guan Yu asked, “Did you notice? Those eyes weren’t human.”

“A demon-human,” Siqi whispered. “A shape-shifting fox demon. They… they slaughtered my family.”

Guan Yu placed steadying hands on her shoulders as she trembled. “The one tonight had the same eyes.”

“So that was a fox demon?” Xiao Zhi exclaimed.

“Quiet!” A Ze hissed.

Guan Yu’s mind raced. This world held more mysteries than he’d imagined—cultivators, demons, and now shape-shifting monsters. Yet in this realm of flying swords and spiritual arts, perhaps it was all too real.
