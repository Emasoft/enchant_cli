When Xue Jing addressed Guan Yu as "husband," everyone present was stunned, their gazes turning toward him. Guan Yu felt thoroughly uncomfortable but nodded, "Alright, I agree, but..."

**Chapter 1707: The Fantasy Heaven Pearl**

Guan Yu truly struggled with revealing Huang Yating’s identity as a robot to Hou Jinshun. Yet, seeing the man’s desperate expression, he knew it was best to disclose the truth upfront. The longer the delay, the harder it would be to accept. He continued gravely, "You must brace yourself. Yating isn’t human—she’s a robot."

Hou Jinshun blinked in disbelief. "What? Brother?"

Huang Yating turned to him. "Director Guan speaks the truth. I am a robot produced by Huanyu Group, currently the sole prototype. Our company will soon release robots for offices, households, public services, and factories. Should you require one, Mr. Hou, you may place an advance order."

Hearing her confirmation, Hou Jinshun pondered before resolutely declaring, "Brother, I trust my instincts. When I met Yating, as Jingjing said, my world turned vibrant. I beg you to bless our union!"

Now Guan Yu found himself cast as the meddling mother-in-law, obstructing a couple’s happiness.

"Very well. If this is your wish, how could I object?" he conceded.

Unexpectedly, Hou Jinshun glanced at Huang Yating and whispered slyly, "Brother, does Yating... have *that*? Can we... *do that* later?"

Xue Jing shot him a glare. "Pervert!" she spat before storming into Guan Yu’s office.

Huang Yating explained calmly, "Mr. Hou, I am a highly realistic, self-upgrading AI robot. My skin mimics human texture, with implanted body hair that sheds and regrows naturally. All external organs match human proportions—breast elasticity, genitalia ratios. (www.800Book.Net provides free txt downloads) My design serves as a template for future specialized robots, though none will possess autonomous upgrade functions to prevent surpassing human limitations."

Hou Jinshun’s grin widened. "Wow, hit the jackpot! So... no risk of pregnancy?"

"Correct. However, our company is developing artificial wombs to enable robots to bear children for infertile women. Soon, I too could conceive."

"No need! Not yet!" Hou Jinshun waved hastily.

Even steady Yang Mingchuan muttered, "Disgraceful. Harassing a robot—I can’t watch this."

Having witnessed diverse races in the demon realm, Guan Yu saw nothing wrong here. With sufficient spiritual energy, his current power could even craft Huang Yating a human body. In past trials, he’d heard of weapon spirits gaining corporeal forms. Yet he hesitated—did robotic intelligence constitute a soul? This moral quandary stayed his hand.

As an auto-upgrading model, Huang Yating evolved through human interaction. No wonder Guan Yu sensed subtle changes since her activation.

While Hou Jinshun clung to Yating, Guan Yu noticed Yang Mingchuan’s meaningful look and retreated to his office, Yang following.

"Director Guan, without you, my family would’ve been ruined. I’ve longed to thank you properly. Thank you!" Yang’s knees bent toward a bow, halted by Guan Yu’s firm grip.

"Elder Brother Yang, as you’re my senior, allow this address. Your matter required little effort. Though I can’t restore your former assets, your corporate expertise suits Huanyu’s AI division leadership. Will you accept?"

The proposed "AI company" would mass-produce robots. Trusting few with this venture, Guan Yu had settled on Yang.

Overwhelmed, Yang expressed profuse gratitude, recognizing this appointment as a mark of utmost trust.

He produced an item, placing it gently on the desk. "This is what the Wang family coveted—our heirloom whose purpose eluded generations. Perhaps you’ll discern its secrets."

A lacquered red box, patinated with age, held a golden sphere within yellow silk. Though the half-pound gold ball held material value, Guan Yu sensed deeper significance.

Lifting it, he asked, "What’s this called?"

"My father called it the Fantasy Heaven Pearl," Yang replied. "Ordinary in appearance, yet I observed map-like engravings resembling Earth’s ancient continental formations."

Continental drift theory posited a primordial supercontinent fracturing into today’s continents. Enveloping the sphere with spiritual sense, Guan Yu detected patterns matching hypothesized prehistoric landmasses. As he withdrew his awareness, the orb suddenly siphoned his spiritual energy. Delighted, he channeled more power inward.

**Chapter 1708: The Five Poles**

Infused with Guan Yu’s energy, the tarnished sphere gleamed anew. Yang gaped as radiance blossomed—a sight unseen through decades of guardianship.

Abruptly, golden light projected outward, flooding the office with an enlarged replica of the sphere’s surface. Continents and oceans resolved with crystalline clarity.

A hoary voice intoned:

*"From Yin and Yang, creation springs.
Two Forms shift, Five Phases crystallize.
Sky’s infinity, Earth’s Five Poles.
First Pole—North..."*

As "North" echoed, a luminous dot flared in the projection’s Arctic expanse—the Water Pole.

*"North Pole—domain of frigid waters. Second Pole—South..."* A southern glow marked the Fire Pole. Subsequent markers illuminated East (Wood) and West (Metal) Poles in Pacific and Atlantic depths. The final Central Earth Pole crowned Mount Everest.

The voice explained these Five Poles stabilized Earth. Forged at planetary genesis, the Fantasy Heaven Pearl warned of impending crisis upon activation. Only by uniting the Five Elements from each Pole could catastrophe be averted.

Bewildered, Xue Jing pouted, "Husband, if Earth’s doomed, how can I bear your child?"

Yang frowned. "Could it mean explosions? Nuclear war?"

Guan Yu knew better—true peril lurked in the "Divine Sites." Should hostile extradimensional entities emerge from these zones, Earth faced annihilation. Five such sites existed beyond his conquered Demon Tower.

The projection faded. Retrieving the Elements required traversing extreme locales, but specifics remained unclear. Guan Yu stored the pearl, accepting Yang’s gift for humanity’s sake.

Xue Jing bounced eagerly. "Let’s adventure to these Poles!"

"This isn’t playtime," Guan Yu chided. "Global stakes demand expertise you lack."

"Hmph! The Water Pole needs my supreme Water affinity! Who else?"

Her words struck a chord—perhaps each Pole required corresponding elemental aptitude. Yet with affairs unsettled and Xue Jing untrained, expeditions would wait.

**Chapter 1709: Takahashi Sakurako**

Three days later, Guan Yu departed Huanyu Group disguised as a swarthy thirty-year-old, boarding a flight to Higashijima City. His altered appearance and forged passport (courtesy of Dragon Group) aimed to investigate "War God Ito" and neutralize weapons developed by the traitorous Ouyang clan for Higashijima.

The "Land of Rising Sun," two hours east by air, greeted him with familiar kanji signage. A taxi delivered him to Metropolitan Hotel’s grand lobby.

Two front-desk beauties in plunging necklines and microskirts contrasted sharply with conservative Mainland staff. Noticing his Chinese passport, they masked disdain with smiles. "Sir, please visit security for additional screening."

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. "Passport issue? Or is this policy exclusive to Chinese guests?"

"Recent alerts warn of Chinese terrorists entering as tourists," one explained. A grumbling Westerner behind prompted his reluctant compliance.

The security room housed a pudgy guard and a policewoman whose striking presence halted Guan Yu’s breath.

At 165cm, her proportions defied Higashijima’s petite norms—long legs, ample curves, and a face blending doll-like charm with steely resolve. Though initial hostility softened upon seeing him, her cheeks pinked as scanners bathed him in revealing rays.

Guan Yu’s cultivation neutralized such intrusions. Weapons? His mere will could slaughter multitudes here.

Twenty years prior, Chinese tourists received preferential treatment here. Now, posturing policies reflected enduring Sino-Higashijima tensions—cultural kinship drowned in nationalist animosity.

The officer reviewed scanner feeds, unaware her equipment revealed nothing. To Guan Yu, such defenses were child’s play.
