Ling Su strode out, approached the door, and delivered a thunderous kick. With a resounding crash, the wooden panel flew off its hinges, testifying to the tremendous force behind his strike.

Yet what greeted his eyes left him dumbfounded. The room held no trace of Amei—only Lin Chen lay sprawled naked on the floor like a lifeless dog. Though his chest still rose with breath, his utter unconsciousness puzzled Ling Su. Had the fool drunk himself into oblivion?

But how could anyone sleep through such a golden opportunity? This clearly defied Lin Chen’s lustful nature. Ling Su scanned the room. Apart from a small square table bearing a wine pot and two cups—evidently the source of Lin Chen’s downfall—the space stood empty. Amei had vanished as though she’d never existed.

Approaching the table, Ling Su sniffed the wine. Its heady rose fragrance intrigued him—a novel brew indeed. Just as he considered sampling it, a realization struck. He turned to prod Lin Chen’s limp body with his foot. No response, even after sharper kicks.

Inspecting the scene, Ling Su found only discarded clothes beside the unconscious man. Lin Chen’s belongings—hundreds of taels of silver and his jade pendant—had disappeared.

“That woman’s a bandit!” Ling Su exclaimed aloud. The setup became clear: drugged wine had knocked Lin Chen out cold, allowing the thief to strip him clean. While Ling Su should have rejoiced at his rival’s misfortune, irritation prickled him—another had claimed this satisfaction.

Amei’s scheme unfolded plainly. She’d lured Lin Chen here after he foolishly flaunted five hundred taels at the bun shop. Feigning romantic interest, she’d drugged him and pilfered every coin. The idiot had actually believed her act!

Ling Su rummaged through the discarded garments, confirming not even a copper remained. “Brother, I’m delighted by your plight,” he sneered at the motionless form. “This karmic payback suits you perfectly. Preening like a peacock without mirroring your actual worth? Now freeze naked in the streets for all I care.”

With Lin Chen’s funds gone, their expedition would face delays—no silver meant no supplies. But Ling Su couldn’t muster concern. Whether the fool lived or died mattered not. Though tempted to finish him, years of camaraderie stayed his hand... as did cowardice. Murder exceeded his villainous appetite.

Departing, Ling Su spitefully bundled Lin Chen’s clothes and vanished into the night. Let the oaf wake to humiliation.

Hidden behind a bookshelf, Amei emerged once silence fell. She’d feared Ling Su would raise an alarm, nearly attacking him before witnessing this unexpected betrayal. “I thought myself wicked,” she murmured, “but stealing his clothes? That’s diabolical genius.”

Counting her loot—the original five hundred taels plus nearly two hundred more—Amei grinned. “Not bad for a day’s work.” She moved to a wall painting, revealing a hidden compartment crammed with jewels and gold—ill-gotten gains from countless duped travelers.

The bun shop’s “granddaughter” was in truth the elderly proprietor’s young wife, biding time until inheritance crowned her a wealthy widow. For now, this room served as her hunting ground, targeting out-of-town marks through flirtation and drugged wine.

Wrapping Lin Chen in a quilt to avoid fatal exposure, Amei prepared to dump him outside. Let his “friend” explain the missing clothes. She’d replace the broken door and staff, erasing all traces.

Meanwhile, Ling Su tossed the stolen garments near their inn. Most disciples already slept, unaware tomorrow’s desert expedition hung in jeopardy. Sipping wine downstairs, he feigned nonchalance as Guan Yu and Siqi entered.

“Guan Yu, join me,” Ling Su called, abandoning subtlety. “We can’t depart tomorrow—our funds have vanished.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Lin Chen gambled it all again?”

“Worse. Robbed blind by a woman. Not a copper remains.” Ling Su relished the coming storm. “Deal with him as you will—I’ll testify to his incompetence.”

As Guan Yu vowed expulsion, Ling Su hid a triumphant smile. Let the purge begin.
