“Why are you asking me? I don’t even know who to ask,” Guan Yu grumbled. “There’s no logic to this. If she chose to follow them, then so be it. Even Xiaomei herself is relying on her senses to track them. None of us have a clear goal, but I’m sure it’ll take no more than two or three days to find them.”

**Chapter 4572: Teaching Him a Lesson**

“Ugh, the sun in this desert is unbearable. My skin feels like it’s about to crack. Let’s hope nothing goes wrong these next few days,” Wang Jun sighed.

Siqi giggled beside him. “You’re a grown man who already looks quite feminine, yet here you are worrying about your skin. As a woman, even I don’t fuss over it this much.”

Guan Yu froze. Gender was a sensitive topic for Wang Jun, and it was best not to dwell on it. He quickly interjected, “Don’t be surprised, Siqi. I also care about my skin, but for this mission, we have to endure. Wang Jun, you should try to bear it too.”

Wang Jun said nothing and rode his camel over to Aze, where the two began murmuring privately.

Siqi glanced curiously at Guan Yu. “Did I say something wrong? Do you think I misspoke earlier?”

“No. Your skin is flawless—even this harsh sun can’t darken it. Others would envy you. It’s nothing,” Guan Yu reassured. After a pause, he added, “Also, try not to distinguish between men and women in front of Wang Jun. He’s… sensitive about gender topics.”

“Why?” Siqi frowned, puzzled. “Aren’t men and women inherently different? Is Wang Jun not a man?”

Guan Yu tensed, shooting a glance at Wang Jun, who was still deep in conversation with Aze. Thankfully, he hadn’t overheard. Otherwise, his mood would sour for days. Though Wang Jun couldn’t retaliate against Siqi, his sulking would make Guan Yu’s life miserable—especially since they were close friends.

Lowering his voice, Guan Yu said, “That’s exactly what you shouldn’t say. Be more careful.”

To clarify, he whispered, “Wang Jun… isn’t actually a man.”

“What?!” Siqi gasped loudly, drawing everyone’s attention.

Guan Yu winced. He should’ve prepared her first to avoid such a reaction.

“What’s going on with you two? Why the commotion in broad daylight?” Xiaomei called out, slowing her camel to join them. “Mind sharing the gossip?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Private matters. None of your business. I was just reprimanding her.”

“Oh?” Xiaomei’s eyes gleamed with mischief. “Why not let me watch? I could use some entertainment.”

“Family disputes shouldn’t be aired publicly. I’ll discipline her properly tonight,” Guan Yu retorted coolly.

Xiaomei chuckled. “Ah, so the best lessons happen after the candles are blown out. Enjoy yourselves, then.” She urged her camel forward to lead the group again.

Siqi, aware Guan Yu was deflecting, remained unoffended but deeply curious. Guan Yu leaned closer. “I’ll explain Wang Jun’s situation, but keep your reactions in check. Understand?”

Siqi nodded eagerly.

“In your world, this isn’t unheard of, though rare. You know of eunuchs in the imperial palace, right? Men castrated to serve royalty? Wang Jun is… the opposite. Does that make sense?”

Siqi pondered. “So Wang Jun was a woman but became a man?”

“Exactly. Wang Jun was once a dignified woman, but due to personal reasons, underwent a medical procedure in our homeland to transition. However, he can’t father children. Such choices aren’t widely accepted there, which is why he avoids the topic here. He detests being reminded of it.”

“I see,” Siqi murmured, glancing at Wang Jun with newfound sympathy. “Thank you for telling me. I might’ve offended him otherwise.”

“Act as if you never learned this. Never speak of it to anyone—not even your master, Elder Dai. This is Wang Jun’s secret. I’d never have told you unless necessary.”

**Chapter 4573: Sweltering Heat**

“I swear I’ll keep it to myself,” Siqi vowed, understanding the gravity. If word spread, Wang Jun could face ridicule or worse. She resolved to bury the secret.

The journey proceeded smoothly, as Guan Yu predicted. The only torment was the scorching sun, fiercer than previous days. Summer’s approach amplified the desert’s oven-like heat, with sand burning underfoot. By evening, the group relished the milder temperature, though the ground still radiated warmth.

Guan Yu longed for a shower—a futile wish here. After resting, they hurried to pitch tents before nightfall. Though the sand retained heat, the wind grew colder. Linked tents ensured safety against potential storms.

As darkness settled, many lounged outside, chatting. Guan Yu and Siqi sat on the warm sand, relieved the sweat had dried. Siqi, still pondering Wang Jun, asked, “Why would he choose to become a man? Does your homeland favor sons over daughters?”

“No,” Guan Yu replied. “Unlike here, where war and polygamy marginalize women, my homeland practices equality. Women fight and work alongside men. Wang Jun’s choice stemmed from personal identity, not societal pressure.”

“But why reject being a woman?”

“It’s about individual inclination. In our world, some women are drawn to other women. Wang Jun’s transition aligned with his true self, though such paths are often met with prejudice.”

“Oh…” Siqi finally grasped the nuance. “Your homeland sounds fascinating. I’d love to visit.”

“It’s a world apart,” Guan Yu mused. “Imagine your current era as my homeland’s ancient past. Culturally, we’re millennia ahead.”

Siqi’s eyes widened. “Are you from the future? A thousand years ahead?”

Guan Yu grinned. “Exactly. To you, I’m a time traveler.”

“If I cultivate for a millennium, will our world resemble yours?”

“Perhaps, but both worlds evolve. They’ll never mirror each other.” Guan Yu marveled at her quick comprehension. Siqi’s bond with him felt almost telepathic, her loyalty split between him and her master, Elder Dai. He dreaded future conflicts with Yunqing Sect, knowing her heart would撕裂.

**Chapter 4574: Unruly Shouting**

The night passed uneventfully. By dawn’s first light, Xiaomei’s shouts roused the camp.

“Why the racket?” Guan Yu groaned, emerging bleary-eyed. “It’s barely sunrise!”

“We leave now!” Xiaomei declared. “The cool hours are ideal for travel. Everyone up!”
