The monster now lay weakly on the ground, motionless yet still panting heavily. Clearly exhausted, it emitted muffled groans with none of its former sharp-eyed ferocity – thoroughly subdued after the battle.

Guan Yu and Jiang Yuan cautiously advanced several paces, maintaining a prudent distance. Such cunning creatures might feign weakness to lure prey closer. "Brother Jiang," Guan Yu snorted, eyeing the prone beast, "I wonder if this thing understands human speech. It nearly escaped us earlier – capturing it was no small feat."

"Indeed, an astute adversary," Jiang Yuan agreed. "Though communication seems impossible. We'll likely never learn its origins or why it preyed here. Once we secure it, we should investigate that black hole." He gestured toward the ominous pit, determined to bury whatever remains the creature had left from its grisly feasts. If bones remained, proper burial was owed. Should the beast prove to have devoured everything, dissection would be their grim duty.

"We must act swiftly to prevent complications," Guan Yu urged, raising his Soul-Reaping Blade. "This abomination serves no purpose alive."

"Agreed," Jiang Yuan hefted his broadsword. "Allow no recovery – strike now!"

As both warriors poised for lethal blows, Wang Xiaorong approached from afar, believing the matter settled.

Suddenly – *whoosh!* – the monster sprang upward with explosive force, freezing the attackers mid-swing. The black hole's blue barrier had dissipated. With desperate roar, the creature lunged toward the pit despite Guan Yu's blade shearing its tail and Jiang Yuan's strike crippling a hind leg. Blood sprayed as it vanished into the abyss, sacrificing flesh for freedom.

"Deceived!" Guan Yu cursed. "Its weakness was feigned – waiting for the barrier's collapse!"

Jiang Yuan grimaced. "Had we struck immediately..."

The beast's ruse became clear – playing possum to regain strength while the magical seal expired. Now it fled into stygian depths, leaving the hunters thwarted.

**Chapter 5075: Cautious Advance**

"After it!" Jiang Yuan declared. "While wounded!"

Guan Yu turned to Wang Xiaorong. "Return to Qiqi. We pursue."

"I help!" she insisted, gripping his arm. After brief consideration, he nodded – her magical support might prove vital.

Descending into pitch darkness, they ignited torches revealing a vast cavern. Damp walls glistened with ancient moss, the air thick with stagnant moisture. Jiang Yuan led cautiously, each step echoing through the subterranean expanse.

"This flood-exposed chasm must be ancient," he observed, examining water-smoothed stones. "But where's our quarry?"

The trio navigated winding tunnels, finding no spoor. At a bifurcation, Wang Xiaorong detected faint airflow from the left passage. "An exit nearby!"

Confirming the subtle draft, they split – Jiang Yuan taking the right fork while the couple pursued the left.

**Chapter 5076: Divided Paths**

"Stay close," Guan Yu warned, clasping Wang Xiaorong's hand. The oppressive darkness pressed around their flickering torchlight, every shadow potentially harboring ambush.

Jiang Yuan's voice echoed final advice: "Limit exploration time. Regroup at camp if unsuccessful."

As they progressed, Wang Xiaorong suddenly halted. "Wind!" she whispered. The faint current suggested proximity to surface access – and possibly their prey's escape route.

Guan Yu confirmed the telltale breeze. "This way. Quickly!"

Torch flames wavered as they pressed forward, the monster's blood trail long washed away by subterranean waters. Determination warred with prudence – how far dare they chase this wounded terror through the earth's bowels? The answer lay ahead in the lightless deep, where human senses faltered but primal instincts thrived.
