Hearing Lü Mei’s words, Guan Yu remained unmoved, as if he hadn’t heard her at all. Standing up, he said, “Brother Wei, let’s go to the bathroom. The mosquitoes in this classroom are huge—they bite like hell.”

Lü Mei flushed with anger. “Guan Yu, what do you mean by that?” she snapped. “Explain yourself clearly! Who are you calling a mosquito?”

Finally responding to her outburst, Guan Yu turned to face her. “Miss Lü of the noble Lü family,” he said coolly, “as someone of distinguished upbringing, shouldn’t you mind your manners? Your screeching is ruining your image in the eyes of your male classmates. Besides, do I owe you money? Or any favors? What gives you the right to shout at me like this?”

Guan Yu’s words infuriated the little hellion Lü Mei even further. Though she had a spoiled young lady’s temper, she was still a girl with thin skin. Unable to bear his mockery, she buried her face in her arms and burst into tears at her desk.

Guan Yu froze. The usually tough girl had crumbled into sobs without warning. Wei Hongwei tugged his sleeve nervously. “Brother Guan, this looks bad. The whole class is watching. What do we do now?”

Lü Mei’s wails grew louder, as if she were pouring out weeks of pent-up grievances. Every male student’s heart ached at the sound.

Guan Yu paced helplessly until their homeroom teacher approached. “Guan Yu,” she said, “even if Lü Mei was wrong, shouldn’t a man show more magnanimity? Women shouldn’t be spoiled, but they still need gentle handling.”

“Sob…I d-don’t…want him…sob…to handle me!” Lü Mei hiccuped through tears, her words barely intelligible. Guan Yu massaged his temples. Her devastated crying made him wonder if he’d truly driven her to this state.

Relenting, he approached her desk. “Miss Noble Lady, could you please stop crying? Let’s talk this through. What good does weeping do?”

**Chapter 1801: The Heavy Blow**

His words had some effect. Lü Mei’s sobs gradually quieted, allowing Guan Yu to breathe easier. But then Chen Maosheng strode forward from the back, placing his hands on Lü Mei’s shoulders—a move that drew venomous glares from every male classmate.

Seizing the opportunity to take advantage, Chen Maosheng sneered at Guan Yu. “You’re a real piece of shit, Guan Yu. Apologize to Lü Mei right now, or I’ll make you regret it.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Chen Maosheng, does your family know you’re such a brazen asshole? A petty coward like you isn’t worth my attention. Why don’t you hire more thugs to ambush me at the school gate again? Oh wait—last time they ended up cowering before me. How’s that working out for you?”

Murmurs spread through the class as Wei Hongwei added loudly, “So it was Chen Maosheng who sent those men to block Guan Yu and Lü Mei! They got humiliated instead. Now he’s back for more? Asking for a beating!”

Suddenly, Lü Mei lifted her tear-streaked face and glared at Chen Maosheng. “Take your filthy hands off me.”

Panicking, Chen Maosheng stammered, “Lü Mei, let me explain! I just have some issues with Guan Yu—”

“I said remove your hands!” Lü Mei stood abruptly and slapped him hard across the face. “Get lost! I never want to see you again!”

Gasps filled the room. “Damn, the little devil’s unleashed! She even dared slap Young Master Chen!”

“Serves him right! Should’ve hit him harder!”

Chen Maosheng clutched his reddening cheek, face darkening. “You bitch! How dare you strike me?!”

Pan Xiaoxia, witnessing this, frowned in disappointment.

When Chen Maosheng drew back his arm to retaliate, the class held its breath. But his palm froze inches from Lü Mei’s face—Guan Yu had materialized beside her, two fingers clamped like steel around his wrist.

“You’re trash, Chen Maosheng,” Guan Yu growled, tightening his grip until Chen Maosheng yelped in pain. “A man hitting a woman? Disgusting.”

*Slap! Slap! Slap!*

Three resounding strikes left Chen Maosheng dazed. As he stumbled back, Guan Yu kicked him viciously, sending him crashing into desks before he crumpled to the floor, howling like a scam artist.

The class watched in grim satisfaction. When Guan Yu moved to deliver another blow, Lü Mei tugged his sleeve. “Enough,” she whispered.

Seeing her tear-stained, vulnerable face, Guan Yu’s anger dissolved. He longed to embrace her. “Fine,” he said softly. “For your sake, I’ll spare him today. But if he doesn’t change, next time I won’t hold back.”

Lü Mei wordlessly released him and returned to her seat. Chen Maosheng, nursing broken ribs, was hauled to the hospital while Guan Yu followed Teacher Pan to her office.

“You went too far today,” she admonished. “Such violence could have serious consequences.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Cultivators like us sometimes lose control. Besides, who knew he’d break so easily?”

Pan Xiaoxia’s eyes narrowed. “How did you know I’m a cultivator? Are you one too? Why couldn’t I sense it?”

“Those with higher cultivation can see through others’ levels,” Guan Yu replied. “You couldn’t detect mine because I surpass you.”

**Chapter 1802: The Staged Accident**

Pan Xiaoxia confessed her stalled progress since beginning cultivation six months earlier, guided by cryptic words from a mysterious monk. Guan Yu took her hand, probing her meridians.

“There’s a parasitic energy consuming your cultivation,” he concluded. “It’s feeding on your newly gained qi. If left unchecked, it could devour your spiritual consciousness.”

Pan Xiaoxia paled. “Can you help?”

“I can try, but it requires time. Meet me after school.”

That evening, as Pan Xiaoxia drove them to her apartment, an elderly woman suddenly collapsed before their Bentley.

“Are you hurt?” Pan Xiaoxia asked, rushing out.

The woman wailed theatrically. “My leg’s broken! I need compensation!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Classic staged accident. Let the police handle this.”

**Chapter 1803: The Stolen Child**

While waiting, Guan Yu noticed the “grandmother” held a baby unnaturally. “That child’s probably stolen,” he muttered, dialing the police.

The old woman, growing impatient, began banging her head on the hood. Guan Yu watched coldly. “Keep表演. The cops will love your drama.”

As twilight deepened, the truth unfolded—the child was indeed kidnapped. When officers arrived, Guan Yu handed over the dashcam footage, exposing the fraud.

“Let this be a lesson,” he told the trembling impostor. “Next time, pick a mark who can’t see through your lies.”
