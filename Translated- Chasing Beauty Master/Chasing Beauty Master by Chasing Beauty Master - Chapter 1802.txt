“There are also several small metal flowers here, though I can’t tell what metal they’re made of.” Guan Yu remarked curiously, “Uncle Lu, perhaps my knowledge is lacking. I’ve only known magical artifacts to embed a single type of pearl for storing spiritual energy. But this Phoenix Bracelet is adorned with multicolored pearls—I’ve never seen anything like it.”

First Seat Lu explained, “This is actually simple to explain. You’re right—normally, each artifact can only bear one type of pearl for spiritual storage, as refiners can only fuse one type onto it. The uniqueness of this Phoenix Bracelet lies in its construction. These pearls each possess distinct qualities yet are interconnected through the bracelet’s mysterious metal. This metal binds all pearls into a unified storage space. Since you haven’t bonded with it yet, you can’t perceive its true marvel. The bracelet’s greatest wonder lies in its refinement process. It requires multiple refinements, each adding a new pearl. Thus, its completion must have spanned considerable time. As for the colorful pearls… perhaps the refiner simply favored beauty.”

Guan Yu nodded. The master who refined this bracelet was likely a woman—one with a keen eye for aesthetics. Yet the metal’s ability to harmonize disparate pearls defied conventional logic, marking this as an extraordinary breakthrough.

Confirming it as a high-grade artifact, Guan Yu decided to keep it. Such an exquisite piece would make a perfect gift for charming ladies—an essential tool for winning feminine favor.

Meanwhile, Wang Jun had drifted toward Xuan Ming, eyeing a jade flute beside him. The flute measured about a foot long, slightly thicker than a thumb. Guan Yu recognized it from his early days at Yunqing Sect. When his dual aptitude for magic and martial arts was discovered, both Xuan Ming and First Seat Lu had vied to take him as a disciple. During their competition, Xuan Ming had once displayed his treasures—this flute among them.

What etched it into Guan Yu’s memory was his initial desire to claim it. The flute’s pristine appearance—its vivid green hue—exuded scholarly elegance. Holding it would instantly project refined grace, perfect for cultivating an air of sophistication.

“Don’t hold back—take what catches your eye. We’re sacrificing an immortal artifact anyway. Why hesitate?” Guan Yu strode over, plucking the flute and handing it to Wang Jun. “See if you like it.”

The moment his fingers brushed the jade, Guan Yu froze. A chilling sensation crawled up his arm as the flute began draining his spiritual energy autonomously. He flung it to the ground with a startled cry, “Don’t touch it yet!” Turning to Xuan Ming, he warned, “Master, this flute absorbs spiritual energy! I felt it the instant I held it.”

Unfazed, Xuan Ming nodded. “This flute does carry traces of sinister demonic energy. Recall how you fancied it upon your arrival? I withheld it then, fearing its corrupting influence might overwhelm your fledgling cultivation. But now…” He appraised Guan Yu, “…you should be capable of subduing it.”

Chapter 4714: Golden Leaves

“Can Wang Jun use it safely? Any risks?” Guan Yu pressed.

“No issue,” Xuan Ming assured. “Though classified as a high-grade artifact, its malevolence has waned over years in my possession. With minor adjustments, it can be safely wielded.”

Such concessions revealed their desperation for the Dragon Eye Amber—a true hemorrhage of treasures.

Guan Yu turned to Wang Jun. “Take it. This is an exceptional artifact. Once bonded, its demonic traces will gradually purify—like Siqi’s Jade Ruyi. Fear not.”

Wang Jun gingerly retrieved the flute. To his relief, no energy drain occurred. Delight blossomed as he examined the piece—not jade, but flawless emerald gemstone carved into perfection. Compared to his current iron fan artifact, this treasure justified sacrificing the Dragon Eye Amber.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu circled the room until First Seat Lu’s bait caught his eye—a bulging pouch of golden leaves, identical to previous gifts.

“Uncle Lu, you shouldn’t have…” Guan Yu grinned, pocketing the pouch without hesitation.

The practicality of minting gold into leaf form outweighed cumbersome ingots. Easily divisible and portable, these leaves simplified transactions—a system Guan Yu had nearly exhausted after funding Wang Jun’s crossbow project. This replenishment pleased him, though his scavenger hunt continued.

Among First Seat Lu’s wares lay an ancient sword. Its metal scabbard bore intricate carvings—patterns or script indecipherable to Guan Yu. Resembling Qin-era weaponry, it exuded antiquated grandeur. Marketed in the mortal world, such an artifact would fetch astronomical sums.

Unlike typical spirit-blades storing energy in hilt gems, this sword’s scabbard glittered with crimson stones.

“Bloodstones?” Guan Yu gasped, lifting the blade.

“Your discernment improves.” First Seat Lu puffed with pride. “Rare bloodstones adorn this scabbard. This Blood Sword has accompanied me for centuries. Discovered in a village elder’s home during my youth, it was my first high-grade artifact—a treasure beyond belief for a novice cultivator. The bloodstones alone make it invaluable.”

As Lu extolled its virtues, Guan Yu unsheathed the blade. A crimson aura flashed—vanishing as steel met scabbard. Repeating the motion confirmed the phenomenon.

“This scarlet glow birthed its name,” Lu explained. “Observe—the scabbard’s twin bloodstones align with another at the blade’s base when sheathed. Drawing the sword separates them, releasing that crimson flash. Magnificent, no?”

Guan Yu hefted the blade. Though shorter than standard swords—ideal for single-handed use—its unusual tapered design (three fingers wide at base, narrowing to pinky-width at tip) balanced substantial weight. The rare metal composition suited both genders, offering versatile handling.

Contemplating replacing his Soulfall Blade, Guan Yu practiced forms, growing fonder by the moment. He resolved to claim it pending further evaluation against his current weapon.

Wang Jun, content with his flute, worried Guan Yu’s greed might overstep. Meanwhile, Guan Yu ransacked both masters’ collections until Xuan Ming snapped: “Guan Yu! Raiding both our hoards? With whom are you bargaining?”

“Ah! Forgot that detail.” Guan Yu grinned shamelessly. “This supreme treasure deserves double payment. Feeling cheated, Master? Split the Dragon Eye Amber between yourselves.” He tossed the amber aside, sparking a scramble.

“Don’t brawl! Whoever claims it strengthens Yunqing Sect!” Guan Yu warned as the masters lunged. Xuan Ming, closer, grabbed it first—only for Lu to strike his wrist. The amber flew as robes tore and kicks redirected its fall. After brief tussling, Xuan Ming triumphed, stashing his prize hastily.

First Seat Lu glowered. “Since the amber went to Sect Leader, return my treasures. This affair no longer concerns me.”

Wang Jun tensed—his earlier fears materializing.

Guan Yu recoiled. “Uncle Lu! A man’s honor is his face, a tree’s its bark. You offered these willingly. Would you shame yourself before the entire sect?”

Xuan Ming feigned innocence. “This doesn’t involve me. Settle your own disputes.”

Chapter 4715: No Relation

“But I provided treasures expecting the amber!” Lu protested. “Since I gained nothing, why should you keep them?”

“Reneging in your old age?” Guan Yu retorted. “You agreed this amber outweighed all combined treasures! Will you dishonor your word?”

“At least return everything except the gold leaves!” Lu bargained.

“Dream on.” Guan Yu stood firm. “I already regret parting with the amber. Demand restitution? Absurd!” He gestured at Xuan Ming. “Retrieve the amber from him, and I’ll return your trinkets.”

Lu turned pleading eyes to Xuan Ming, who shrugged. “Why involve me? This is your quarrel.”

Chapter 4716: Fortune’s Arrival

“Sect Leader! How can you be so detached?” Lu fumed, veins throbbing. His plundered treasures haunted him, while Xuan Ming basked in amber-induced bliss.

Guan Yu interjected, “Uncle Lu, you vowed any treasure for the amber. Honor your oath. Unless…” He smirked, “…Master coughs up more goods, compensating my ‘loss.’”

As Lu glared, Xuan Ming yawned. “Their business, not mine.”

The standoff crystallized—Guan Yu victorious in his plunder, the masters nursing their wounds, and Wang Jun marveling at how greed had triumphed over sect elders’ wisdom.
