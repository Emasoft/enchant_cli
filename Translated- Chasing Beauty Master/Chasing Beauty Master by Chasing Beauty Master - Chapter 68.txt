“Luo, the big boss? Where the hell did this Luo guy pop up from? Never heard of him! What’s his turf?” Perhaps irritated by his losses, the middle-aged man tilted his head and looked provocatively at Luo Cheng.

“Nothing…I’m no big shot. Compared to you gentlemen, I’m just a street punk. I’m nothing!” Luo Cheng sensed the tension in the air and forced a smile, though inwardly he cursed. *Guan Yu’s winning too blatantly. No wonder these big shots are pissed—he’s cleaning them out without mercy!*

Several underlings brought by the bosses, including seasoned card sharps, had been scrutinizing the game throughout. Yet Guan Yu kept winning—sometimes without even touching the cards. It could only be attributed to sheer luck!

“Liu’er, take over for me. I’m hitting the restroom.” The gold-chain-wearing man stood, jerking his chin at a scrawny young man beside him.

Bao Si hesitated, then noticed the other bosses eyeing him. He tilted his head, rubbed his nose, and glanced at the wall clock before swallowing hard. “Half an hour. It’s getting dark. If you wanna keep playing, wrap it up by then. Afterward, I’ll treat everyone to dinner. Let’s keep it lively!”

Meeting the bosses’ gazes unflinchingly, Bao Si stood his ground. This was his compromise. *My casino’s reputation hinges on fair play. I promised no cheating. Now these bosses are ganging up to swindle this rookie. Time to show some backbone.*

As for how much Guan Yu would lose? Not his problem.

The game resumed. Though unsure why Bao Si had set a time limit, Guan Yu vaguely guessed the reason.

*Cheating?* Guan Yu smirked inwardly. *With my detection ability, what do I care about their tricks? I’m the grandmaster of all cheats!*

**Chapter 164: Vomiting What You’ve Eaten**

Rounds passed with mixed wins, but Guan Yu kept folding early, refusing to escalate bets.

When the gold-chain boss returned, looming behind Liu’er with a venomous glare, the atmosphere thickened.

“What’s wrong, kid? Losing your nerve after winning? Dragging this out like you’re mocking us?” the boss sneered, edges of fury showing.

Guan Yu shrugged. “No good hands. Who’d back down from easy money?”

The man snorted dismissively.

Three cards slid to Guan Yu. A glance froze him—three sixes. Liu’er’s hand? Three nines.

*A setup to bleed me dry.*

Knowing the trap, Guan Yu flipped two sixes with feigned confidence. “A pair! Might even be three. Fold now!” He tossed in 10,000 yuan, ignoring the third card.

Bosses folded strategically, leaving Guan Yu and Liu’er.

After 100,000 yuan piled in, Guan Yu suddenly waved. “I’m out. Your hand beats my pair.”

“But we haven’t seen your last card!” Niu Le protested, thumping Guan Yu’s shoulder.

“Why bother? Think I’d magically get three sixes? Even if I did, I’m done!” Guan Yu slapped his thigh, discarding the cards.

The hidden heart six vanished into the pile—a missed fortune. Liu’er frowned. *Did he notice my shuffle?*

**Chapter 165: Is Two Million Even Money?**

Later, Guan Yu dealt himself two aces against Liu’er’s two kings. The pot swelled to millions as bystanders watched breathlessly.

“Running low?” Guan Yu nodded at Liu’er’s dwindling stack.

“Don’t worry. Fourth Brother, bring another 500,000!” the gold-chain boss barked.

When the cash arrived, Guan Yu’s blood chilled—Liu’er’s hand now held three kings. *He switched cards under our noses!*

Guan Yu shoved his cards into the pile. “Fold.”

The room gasped. *Abandoning a million-yuan pot?*

Du Xiaojuan and Luo Cheng stared in confusion. Guan Yu’s 400,000 profit had just halved, yet he smiled. *They’ll vomit back every stolen coin.*

**Chapter 166: Showdown**

Current hand: Guan Yu’s pair of fours versus Liu’er’s pair of twos.

As bets skyrocketed, Du Xiaojuan tugged Guan Yu’s shirt, agonizing. *Why gamble on such trash?*

“Using cards as markers. Each equals 5,000 yuan.” Guan Yu stacked his remaining deck.

The gold-chain boss leered. “Sure you can cover this, kid? Those markers aren’t playthings.”

Guan Yu grinned. “Two million’s pocket change. Keep worrying about your own cash.”

Sweat beaded his brow. *Where’s his ace? How’s he swapping cards?*

Liu’er remained unflappable. Guan Yu’s mind raced—*Duplicate cards?*

The final bet loomed. Guan Yu’s markers neared exhaustion.

“Time to show,” the boss jeered.

Guan Yu steadied his breath. *Stay calm. Find the trick.*
