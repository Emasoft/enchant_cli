“Is everyone tired?” Guan Yu glanced at the people in the courtyard. These brothers truly came through in times of need. He heard they had moved the road-blocking dirt piles bit by bit with their bare hands – an immensely laborious task.

Observing their energetic demeanor, Guan Yu nodded in satisfaction. “There’s still work to be done recently. After we finish these tasks, I’ll host another feast with wine for everyone. Today, I want to express my gratitude here.”

Cheers erupted from the crowd, their excitement palpable. They felt following Guan Yu guaranteed prosperity.

Over the following days, Guan Yu maintained frequent contact with the four monks. He had Wei Hongwei and Jia Po contribute funds and manpower to renovate the rear temple’s walls and courtyard. The walls, badly vandalized, required bloodstain removal and repainting. Otherwise, pilgrims visiting the mountain temple would flee at the sight of blood-smeared walls.

Guan Yu developed good rapport with the monks during this period. Without their earlier assistance, he wouldn’t have survived until reinforcements arrived. Feeling genuine gratitude, he instructed Wei Hongwei – already acquainted with them – to donate supplies and incense money to Houyuan Temple under the guise of Buddhist offerings.

Moreover, Guan Yu contemplated inviting them to join the Yu Gang. He believed it was time to strengthen the gang by recruiting cultivators. The four monks’ inclusion would be ideal.

One evening, Guan Yu and Xue Jing revisited Houyuan Temple where Wei Hongwei and the monks awaited. En route, Guan Yu had Wei Hongwei bring vegetarian dishes, steamed buns, wine, and meat. Seated in the front courtyard pavilion, they conversed while the monks ate vegetarian fare. Wei Hongwei and Guan Yu consumed the meat and wine, while Xue Jing nibbled steamed buns before declaring herself full.

“Big Beard, are you abstaining too? Come have some meat,” Guan Yu teased.

The burly monk blinked. “Of course. As Master’s second disciple and temple monk, I must keep precepts. How could I break vows?”

“Remarkable! Who’d guess a vegetarian could maintain such physique? I thought you indulged in meat and wine!” Guan Yu chuckled.

Big Beard smiled. “Modern monks aren’t so strict – it’s more about self-restraint. Many monks nowadays eat meat and drink. But we four were raised by Master. Even Xiao Bai, though keeping his hair, must observe precepts. Otherwise, Master would expel us.”

“Your Master’s that strict? Don’t you sneak bites when he’s absent?” Guan Yu mischievously suggested.

“Impossible!” Shen Sheng interjected. “Master’s 104 years old but sharp-eyed. He discerns everything. If we broke vows, he’d know immediately upon meeting us.”

“That formidable?” Guan Yu grew curious about this centenarian sage.

Through casual conversation, Guan Yu learned the monks never descended the mountain. Houyuan Temple’s spacious rear courtyard grew vegetables sustaining them, sometimes for half-year stretches without leaving temple grounds.

“Today I came mainly to thank you all for your previous assistance,” Guan Yu stated solemnly.

Shen Sheng waved dismissively. “Brother Guan Yu, further thanks become tedious. Though our worlds differ, we understand camaraderie and shared hardship. You’ve shown great kindness through Young Master Wei’s efforts. Let’s avoid formalities.”

Nodding, Guan Yu said, “Then I’ll speak plainly. I’ve a proposal – I wish to invite you to join Yu Gang…”

Guan Yu studied their reactions intently after his proposition. The monks exchanged glances before Shen Sheng responded, “We recognize your generosity and integrity, Brother Guan Yu. But Yu Gang remains an underground organization. If Master discovered our involvement, we’d face severe punishment – possibly confinement.”

Guan Yu smiled reassuringly. “Don’t worry. If you join, I’ll handle all consequences.”

Their hesitant expressions persisted, unaccustomed to secular conflicts. To Guan Yu, these four were treasures – their combined combat prowess could rival a First-Class Honored cultivator. Their coordinated defense had withstood Ha Da’s assaults; united, they could challenge higher-tier opponents.

“My invitation stands practical, not ceremonial,” Guan Yu clarified. “You may maintain mountain life. I’d only request assistance during crises.”

Relief washed over the monks. Shen Sheng declared, “Even non-members would aid you, Brother Guan Yu. That’s friendship’s duty.”

“Exactly!” Big Beard boomed through mouthfuls of steamed bun. “As brothers, demand our help whenever needed!”

Guan Yu pressed, “Then you agree to join Yu Gang?”

Wei Hongwei cheered, “Marvelous! With four seniors joining, Yu Gang’s power surges! Let’s toast!”

Raising his cup, Guan Yu proclaimed, “Drink to this! You’re now Yu Gang members!”

Cornered, the monks acquiesced. Shen Sheng lifted his teacup, “Then we’ll toast with tea, joining Yu Gang.”

Big Beard added, “I’ve long desired to experience山下生活 – mountain foot life. Provided Master remains unaware!”

They drained their cups. Though Guan Yu could afford drunkenness (Xue Jing being designated driver), he cautioned Wei Hongwei against overindulgence.

“No matter,” Shen Sheng assured. “Young Master Wei can lodge here if intoxicated. Alternatively, I’ll drive him back.”

“You can drive?” Guan Yu asked, surprised at mountain-dwelling monks’ modern skills.

The four chuckled. Shen Sheng explained, “We dwell differently, but aren’t ancient relics. Of course we drive.”

Delighted, Guan Yu declared, “Excellent! I’ll have Wei Hongwei procure vehicles for you all – any model within gang finances.”

Anticipating refusal, Guan Yu preempted, “This settles it. Vehicles facilitate mobility.” The monks reluctantly agreed, Shen Sheng noting, “Temple guardianship remains. When needed, three of us will assist.”

Guan Yu found this acceptable – three cultivators sufficed. The feast continued until midnight.

In subsequent days, Guan Yu sought news of Feitian Lang’s whereabouts since obtaining the treasure map. One morning while strolling his courtyard, Yang Conghan called – unusual unless urgent.

Answering, Guan Yu asked, “What’s wrong, Conghan?”

“Preparing another pre-semester auction, we’ve received someone offering a treasure map. I’m en route to verify,” she replied, car speakers echoing.

“I’ll come immediately.” Hanging up, Guan Yu summoned Xue Jing. En route, she complained about hasty departure, to which Guan Yu teased her masked appearance before explaining the situation.

Chapter 2604: Reappearance of the Treasure Map

At Yang’s auction house, they met Yang Conghan who led them to a VIP room. Two unfamiliar men sat with a small box on the table – presumably containing the map. Neither resembled Feitian Lang nor Yingshan Gu.

After staff dismissal, Guan Yu posed as appraiser while the Yang heiress stood aside. Unfolding the leather scrap, he observed crude markings and a partial “图” (map) character. Unlike his counterfeits, this appeared aged with darkened, indistinct markings.

“I’ve never seen this,” Guan Yu admitted. “This fragment requires professional dating. However, being incomplete limits its value.”

The irritable consignor snapped, “Stop blathering! List it at 10 million base price under my name. Your commission stays.”

Post-examination, Yang Conghan whispered, “Sure it’s not yours?”

Guan Yu rolled eyes. “Certain. My fakes differ. This might be the fourth map’s emergence – authenticity unknown.”
