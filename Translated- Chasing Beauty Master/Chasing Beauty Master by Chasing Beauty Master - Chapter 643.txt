“No!” Cat’s Eye growled. “Transfer the energy to Xiao Si! He excels in speed. I fear I cannot escort the young mistress to safety!”

“No, Uncle Mao! I won’t abandon you!” Xue Jing declared stubbornly, her face etched with unwavering resolve.

“Tsk tsk, such melodramatic farewells! How laughable!”

Just as the group conversed urgently, a mocking voice drifted through the empty streets. The sudden intrusion startled everyone. Turning as one, they saw a young man sauntering toward them, hands in pockets and a faint smile playing on his lips—Guan Yu.

“Who are you?” The black-clad men frowned, their voices low. To their senses, this newcomer radiated no extraordinary aura, appearing utterly ordinary. Yet how could a mere mortal approach undetected? Impossible!

“Senior!” Cat’s Eyes’ face lit with hope. He recognized Guan Yu—the expert who had accompanied the young mistress days prior. His racing heart steadied. With this formidable presence here, their lives were secure.

The black-clad men paled. Anyone Cat’s Eye addressed as “senior” could not be weak. Noticing their target’s genuine relief, they lunged toward Xue Jing, intent on seizing her and fleeing.

Watching their charge, Guan Yu’s brow furrowed slightly, a cold smirk forming.

“Did I permit you to move?”

His words fell like a guillotine. Silence swallowed the night—even the crickets’ chirps ceased. The attackers froze mid-lunge, sweat beading on their foreheads. An invisible force locked their bodies in place.

**Chapter 1633: Stay There and Wait**

Terror!

The nameless assailants trembled, cold sweat drenching them. Spatial confinement! Among mutated abilities, this ranked among the most fearsome. Such powerhouses were supposed to be monopolized by major factions—why did one appear in this backwater city?

Cat’s Eye’s group gaped in shock. Their employer possessed spatial abilities, but even he couldn’t effortlessly immobilize five enemies.

“Our deepest gratitude for your intervention, Senior!” Cat’s Eye bowed deeply, reverence coloring his voice. His eight companions followed suit.

“Fate connects us. How could I watch you perish?” Guan Yu approached, smiling at Xue Jing.

“You…”

Xue Jing’s heart churned with conflicting emotions. She’d initially hoped for Guan Yu’s rescue, then pinned hopes on Cat’s Eye—only to face despair again. Now, his timely arrival felt divinely ordained. Was he her guardian spirit?

(Had Guan Yu known her thoughts, he’d have retorted: “Young mistress, you overthink. Coincidence alone brings me here. I’ve no time to babysit you daily…”)

“You risked everything for…this?” Guan Yu eyed the creature clinging to Xue Jing’s arm—a green iguana. The girl had clearly sneaked out to retrieve this pet.

Blushing, Xue Jing murmured, “I…find him endearing.”

Cat’s Eye’s group stared incredulously. They’d nearly died for a lizard? Suppressing frustration at their mistress’ whims, they sighed inwardly.

As Guan Yu chatted casually, the immobilized men endured agony. Uncertainty gnawed at them—what fate awaited?

After exchanging pleasantries, Guan Yu turned to Xue Jing. “How shall we deal with them?”

With a subtle flex of power, the spatial prison扭曲ed. The men’s bodies contorted grotesquely, features twisting in silent screams. Cat’s Eye watched their tormentors suffer, awe and dread rising.

Seeing their pleading eyes, Xue Jing’s resolve wavered. But Cat’ Eye stepped forward, whispering reminders of their comrades’ injuries. Rage kindled in her gaze as she surveyed her bloodied guards.

“Big Brother…throw them into the lake!” she declared through gritted teeth.

“What?!” Guan Yu and Cat’s Eye gaped. The captives’ eyes blazed with desperate hope.

“Young mistress, this is unwise!” Cat’s Eye protested.

Guan Yu chuckled. “As you wish.” With a wave, the men splashed into the fetid waters—their senses magnified tenfold. Every putrid odor, every wriggling parasite became excruciatingly vivid. Their confinement would lift in three hours.

To Cat’s Eye, Guan Yu mind-whispered: *“The bindings dissolve at dawn.”* The guard nodded gratitude—tonight’s humiliation would breed vengeance. Better to eliminate threats quietly.

**Chapter 1634: Uproot the Weed**

“One puzzle remains,” Guan Yu mused. “Mutants number under a hundred globally, yet here…”

Cat’s Eye bowed. “We’re *pseudo-mutants*—our powers come from serum injections extracted from true mutants. Less potent, but mass-producible. Major factions hoard such methods.”

Guan Yu’s frown deepened. This explained the abundance. Pseudo-powers created factional signatures—a dangerous game.

As dawn approached, Guan Yu prepared to leave. Xue Jing hesitated: “Will we meet again?”

Smiling, he condensed qi into a blood-red bracelet. “This withstands three mortal dangers. Shatter it, and I’ll come.”

Donning the glowing artifact, Xue Jing walked away transformed. Behind her, five muffled screams echoed from the lake.

**Chapter 1635: Imperial Glory Bar**

Staring at locked school gates, Guan Yu groaned. Midnight. Where to go? Bars stayed open…

A scarlet Ferrari F430 roared past, laughter trailing. “To Imperial Glory!” its occupants cheered. Following the noise, Guan Yu melted into neon-lit shadows.
