“There’s no such thing as a ‘Golden City.’ If there truly were a city made of gold, bandits would have looted it long ago. But if we’re speaking of the most prosperous city, that would undoubtedly be the capital. Though I’m not certain if that’s the place being referred to.”

“Perhaps it really is. Your Mohist Sect must have already sent people to the capital, right?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Correct,” Wang Xiaorong nodded. “Agents have been dispatched not only to the capital but to all plausible locations. We’re casting a wide net.”

She spoke without reservation, unafraid of Guan Yu knowing the truth. As for the so-called Golden City, its identity remained a mystery to be unraveled slowly.

Guan Yu longed to obtain the second volume of the Eight Drums cultivation manual. With both volumes, he might finally break the seal imprisoning his inner energy and memories—a day he had awaited for what felt like an eternity.

“If it’s beyond comprehension, why dwell on it?” Wang Xiaorong tilted her head. “You’ve never cared for such trivialities. Why the sudden urgency?”

“Curiosity, nothing more,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Elder Menghua (Dream Transformation) truly outdid himself, leaving us this riddle to solve. Once word spreads, the martial world will surely erupt in chaos.”

As he spoke, a rustle echoed from the distance. “Who’s there?!” Guan Yu barked, hand flying to his sword hilt.

Wang Xiaorong tensed, fearing Yunqing Sect pursuers. Instead, a familiar figure emerged from behind a towering oak—Wang Jun, a disciple of Bamboo Peak whom Guan Yu had known since their days in City A.

*This is bad,* Guan Yu thought, pulse quickening. *If Wang Jun reports seeing me consorting with demonic cultivators, I’ll never clear my name with Elder Mu.*

Wang Xiaorong relaxed upon recognizing the newcomer. “Why are you here?” Guan Yu demanded softly, muscles coiled like a spring.

“Merely enjoying the scenery,” Wang Jun replied casually. “Heard voices and came to investigate. Bold of you two to meet openly in daylight—and at such volume. Do you court discovery?”

“This forest spans leagues,” Wang Xiaorong countered. “Your presence here is the true oddity.”

Approaching, Wang Jun bowed deeply. “Greetings, Young Mistress.”

“Enough formalities.” She waved dismissively.

Guan Yu gaped. “You’re with the Mohist Sect?!”

Chapter 3574: You Big Dummy

Wang Jun nodded warily, caught between loyalties. A single misstep could prove fatal.

“Fear not,” the Bamboo Peak disciple assured Guan Yu. “Your secret remains safe with me.”

“See that it does,” Wang Xiaorong commanded. “Today never happened. Understood?”

“By your will, Young Mistress.” With another bow, Wang Jun vanished into the foliage.

“Can we trust him?” Guan Yu pressed. “My standing in Yunqing hangs by a thread.”

“His life belongs to the Mohist Sect,” she said with cold certainty. “He values his neck too much to betray us.”

Relieved, Guan Yu noticed a bulky sack nearby. “Yours? What’s inside?”

“Bedding for outdoor naps.” With theatrical flair, Wang Xiaorong unfurled the bundle, assembling a makeshift tent using poles and quilts.

“Planning to homestead here?” Guan Yu marveled.

“Last night’s mountain excursion proved chilly,” she admitted, confirming Guan Yu’s suspicion about the shadow he’d glimpsed near Tiger Peak.

“The note on my pillow—your doing?”

“Sent a messenger while you were out. Didn’t notice immediately, did you?” Her laughter tinkled like wind chimes. “Oh, you big dummy!”

As twilight deepened, they feasted on fragrant roasted pheasant within the cozy shelter. Wang Xiaorong produced two wine jars, her eyes glinting strangely. “One each. No leaving until they’re empty.”

“You’re on!” Guan Yu boasted, unaware of the herbs steeped in his drink. By the third cup, the world spun pleasantly.

“This wine... unusually potent,” he slurred, heat spreading through his limbs.

“Special medicinal blend,” Wang Xiaorong purred, edging closer. Her perfume overwhelmed the campfire’s smoke.

When Guan Yu awoke at dawn, the headache pounding his skull paled against the shock of bare skin against his—Wang Xiaorong nestled beside him, raven hair fanned across the quilts.

*Disaster.* His mind raced. *How could I—? The Yunqing elders will exile me for this. And the Mohists...*

The young mistress stirred, stretching like a contented cat. “Awake already?” She traced his collarbone. “Now that I’m yours, you’d best not disappoint me.”

Guan Yu’s throat tightened. “Last night... I don’t—”

“What’s done cannot be undone.” Her smile held steel beneath silk. “But fret not—I’ll not drag you to the Mohist Sect. Yet.”

As she spoke, distant bells tolled morning rites. Guan Yu bolted upright. “I’m expected at the back mountains!”

Wang Xiaorong clung to his arm. “So eager to flee after claiming your prize?”

“This isn’t a game!” He disentangled himself, dressing hastily. “If Elder Jiu notices my absence—”

“Go then.” She pouted, though triumph glittered in her eyes. “But remember—you belong to me now.”

Chapter 3575: The Aftermath

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, the “medicinal herbs” had been carefully chosen aphrodisiacs. Wang Xiaorong watched him stagger into the mist, satisfaction curving her lips. *Let that Yunqing hussy try to steal him now.*

Her fingers brushed the love bites on her neck—trophies of conquest. The game had just begun.
