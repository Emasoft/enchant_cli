Finally, after carefully lowering Master Lao Qiu’s body, Yue Gao meticulously examined the beam above before declaring, “Guanyu, I’ll now retrieve the rope and secure it to this beam. Slowly lower me down by the rope.”

Guanyu complied, aware that Yue Gao might wish to gauge the height firsthand or resolve lingering questions. In truth, Yue Gao sought potential clues—though his efforts proved futile.

The group reconvened in the warehouse, isolated and far from convenient transportation or communication. Official authorities would take considerable time to arrive. Meanwhile, temple visitors had begun arriving to offer incense. With only a handful of temple residents and no one to greet them, pilgrims wandered in freely. Upon hearing of the death, the crowd gathered to gawk, while the three remaining disciples had lost all composure to attend to visitors.

Wang Xiaorong remarked, “Two deaths in two days since meeting you, Yue Gao. Are you some cursed star?”

“Unfair!” Yue Gao protested wearily. “Though I’m a detective, I don’t wish death upon anyone!”

Hearing this, Awu urgently interjected, “Detective? Then tell us—was my master killed by the Heavenly Dog? It must be! The Heavenly Dog has returned!”

The crowd shuddered at Awu’s outburst, faces paling with terror. Even Yue Gao felt a chill, though he couldn’t reconcile the inexplicable circumstances.

Ah Huo echoed hysterically, “The Heavenly Dog has come! Just like three years ago! Master’s death matches Ah Gong’s! None of us will escape!” His voice rose to a shout.

Guanyu stepped forward, steadying Ah Huo’s shoulder. “Master Ah Huo, calm yourself. Jumping to conclusions helps nothing. These Heavenly Dog tales are mere legends.”

“Legends?!” Ah Huo spat, verging on frenzy. “Three years ago, it slaughtered Ah Gong. Now Master? This temple is cursed! We’ll all die here!”

Outside, a dozen pilgrims clustered, buzzing about the temple’s grim news. Inside, Guanyu examined Master Lao Qiu’s corpse—swollen chest, protruding tongue, bloodshot eyes burst from asphyxiation. The body had cooled and stiffened, still clad in last night’s unchanged robes.

“Initial observations suggest death occurred six to eight hours ago,” Yue Gao announced. “A single ligature mark on the neck, rope alignment consistent with self-strangulation. Superficially, this appears suicidal.”

**Chapter 3680: Illogical**

“Impossible!” Awu roared. “How could anyone reach that beam without ladders? Only the Heavenly Dog—who soars through skies—could hang Master there! This is its work!”

Trembling violently, Awu seemed utterly convinced. Though the atmosphere chilled them, both Guanyu and Yue Gao dismissed supernatural explanations, despite lacking answers about the beam.

Guanyu probed, “Awu, recount the three-year-old incident.”

Collecting himself, Awu explained, “Three years back, the Heavenly Dog descended, feasting on flesh. Our junior brother Ah Gong was found hanged identically. Now Master... History repeats!”

Guanyu nodded—the parallel was striking, yet suicide remained plausible. “Yue Gao, could they have climbed via ventilation shafts to hang themselves?”

“Impossible,” Yue Gao countered. “The beam’s thick dust showed no disturbance. No traces of climbing—as if the body materialized there. The walls are wax-coated, impossibly smooth. Even martial arts masters couldn’t scale ten meters unaided. Hauling a corpse up? Unthinkable.”

Guanyu concurred—neither suicide nor homicide explained the logistics. Solving the ascent method would unravel the mystery, but celestial dogs held no credence with him.

Wang Xiaorong urged, “Guanyu, this isn’t our affair. This place chills me. Let’s leave.”

“Stay calm,” Guanyu soothed. “We can’t abandon Yue Gao. This will resolve soon.”

Considering the seven temple occupants—victim included—Guanyu deduced the killer among the three disciples. He questioned, “Are only you four in this temple?”

Ah Huo snapped, “Yes! Until you three arrived! You brought the Heavenly Dog!” He pointed accusingly.

Yue Gao interjected, “We’ve no motive. As a detective, I’ll uncover the truth.”

“Convenient!” Ah Xiao sneered. “Detectives spin lies! The Heavenly Dog came for you!”

Guanyu countered, “Why would we kill him? Where’s the logic?” He then inspected the warehouse—ten-meter height, waxed walls, minimal footholds. A newly noticed hole in the wall puzzled him. “Was this here yesterday?”

Awu insisted, “The Heavenly Dog made it! Three years ago, an identical hole appeared after Ah Gong’s death! Humans couldn’t carve this without tools!”

Examining the structure—waxed inner layer, thick wooden planks, sturdy log exterior—Guanyu acknowledged the difficulty. Noticing peach petals by the hole, he stored the clue.

**Chapter 3681: Your Cooperation is Requested**

Ah Huo added, “Master repaired that hole after Ah Gong’s death. Now it’s reopened.”

Guanyu inquired about notifying authorities. Yue Gao confirmed a messenger had been dispatched. Guanyu ordered the body preserved for officials and led the group outside.

Alone with Yue Gao later, Guanyu admitted no concrete leads but suspected the three disciples—particularly Ah Wu and Ah Huo, present during both incidents. Though Yue Gao seemed unlikely, Guanyu withheld trust.

Revisiting the ventilation shaft, Guanyu studied the waterfall-soaked walkway. Peach petals swirled in torrents below. Wang Xiaorong’s approach interrupted his thoughts.

Returning inside, Guanyu noticed the warehouse’s peculiar double-layered door. At the wall hole, inspiration struck. He summoned Yue Gao. “We must question their alibis.”

Yue Gao obliged, addressing the disciples: “Brother Awu—after last night’s meal, your whereabouts?”

“Suspecting me?” Awu bristled. “Because I’m skilled?”

Guanyu placated, “Merely eliminating possibilities. Your cooperation is vital.”

Awu recounted, “I slept in my room. Our chambers adjoin—you heard Yue Gao’s nightmare cry at midnight. I emerged then.”

Guanyu recalled—Master Lao Qiu had already died by then, clearing Awu. Turning to Ah Huo: “And you?”

“Meditated until preparing dawn meals.”

Ah Xiao claimed, “Copied scriptures all night. I’ll show you the pages.”

**Chapter 3682: Watching Eyes**

As Guanyu pondered, an unsettling sensation prickled his neck—the distinct feeling of being watched from the shadows.
