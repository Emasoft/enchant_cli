Since meeting Guan Yu, her life had been changing—constantly changing. Gazing at Guan Yu’s steadfast and reliable back, Qing Linger’s heart churned with confusion. She didn’t know what this emotion was, yet she kept asking herself: Could this be love?

When they arrived outside the Sun family’s high walls, Guan Yu turned and lifted Qing Linger into his arms. Her graceful figure was suddenly suspended in the air as he cradled her in a princess carry. She felt light as a feather. Lowering his head to glance at her flustered face, Guan Yu said softly, “Don’t be afraid.”

Qing Linger nodded vigorously, clutching the medicine box tightly to her chest. With a leap, Guan Yu carried her over the wall into the Sun family’s courtyard.

When they arrived outside the Sun family’s high walls, Guan Yu turned and lifted Qing Linger into his arms. Her graceful figure was suddenly suspended in the air as he cradled her in a princess carry. She felt light as a feather. Lowering his head to glance at her flustered face, Guan Yu said softly, “Don’t be afraid.”

Qing Linger nodded vigorously, clutching the medicine box tightly to her chest. With a leap, Guan Yu carried her over the wall into the Sun family’s courtyard.

Upon seeing Jin Hua, Qing Linger hurriedly checked her pulse. Well-versed in traditional Chinese medicine, she reassured Guan Yu, “Don’t worry, Brother Guan. She’s just extremely weak. Everything else seems normal.”

Guan Yu nodded, urging her to administer the medicine quickly. Qing Linger unwrapped Jin Hua’s bandages, disinfected the wound anew, and reapplied fresh dressings before starting an IV drip.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu entered the surveillance room to review footage from the past two days, fast-forwarding through recordings to spot any suspicious activity.

An hour later, finding nothing unusual, he deemed the location temporarily safe. Instructing Qing Linger to care for Jin Hua, Guan Yu drove to the countryside to fetch her mother after obtaining the address—a promise he intended to fulfill for Qing Hui that very night, even if it meant forgoing sleep.

Qing Linger had visited her mother a few days prior and confirmed her stable condition. She had already phoned her mother to expect someone’s arrival.

Their destination was Ji Bei Village north of City A. With sparse traffic at midnight, Guan Yu maintained high speed until passing an industrial zone. According to Qing Linger’s directions, the village entrance was marked by a thick poplar tree over two meters in girth. A li further west, at the end of a lane surrounded by a fence, stood two small houses—her home.

The fenced property stood out amidst neighboring brick-walled compounds. Meeting Qing Linger’s mother—a woman in her forties appearing nearly sixty due to chronic illness and malnutrition—Guan Yu verified his identity via phone before escorting her back.

By 5 a.m., they returned to Pan Taisheng’s apartment. Leaving the reunited family in privacy, Guan Yu retrieved Qing Linger and stationed himself by Jin Hua’s side, vigilant against threats. He surmised her injury stemmed from the Yang family, as only their elites could surpass Jin Hua’s evasion skills—her bone-shrinking techniques and peerless lightness footwork made her capture improbable without prowess rivaling his own.

The perpetrator narrowed down to one candidate: Yang Cheng. Guan Yu never imagined Yang Cheng himself would target Jin Hua. Recalling how he’d used the Boundary Sovereign’s relic to save Yang Cheng’s life, he now questioned the decision. Decades-old grudges persisted—Jin Hua’s vendetta against the families and their determination to eradicate her ensured endless strife.

Caught between factions, Guan Yu felt compelled to act yet conflicted. Had Yang Conghan married into the Feng family, leveraging their legendary Ten Thousand-Year Demonic Realm to heal Yang Cheng, circumstances might differ.

Gazing at Jin Hua’s pallid face, pity welled within him. This girl bore lifetimes of burdens with unyielding resilience. Gently caressing her cheek, he kissed her forehead.

Suddenly, Jin Hua stirred, eyelids fluttering open. “Guan Yu… Am I still alive?” she whispered hoarsely.

“You won’t die while I’m here,” he assured.

A faint smile tugged her lips. “Thank you.” A voracious hunger surged through her as she blinked up at him. “I’m starving…”

“Three days unconscious—of course you are. I prepared food earlier.” Reheating KFC takeout in the microwave, Guan Yu served her.

Watching Jin Hua devour a drumstick, he relaxed—her appetite signaled recovery. “How did you get injured?” he asked, placing a glass of water beside her.

“I went to Yang Conghan’s villa to retrieve something while scouting the families’ movements. The Yangs tracked me. Yang Cheng ambushed me, wielding the Yang Family Sword coated in lethal poison. They want me dead.”

Nodding, Guan Yu pressed, “The Yang Family Sword? Is it formidable?”

Jin Hua shot him an exasperated look. “Old Master Yang Kunlun forged his reputation with that blade. Defeating countless masters earned him the nickname ‘Yang the Annoying’ for challenging anyone skilled, consent or not. During the massacre of my Jin family, that sword claimed innumerable lives.” Her grip deformed the hamburger.

“Focus on healing now,” Guan Yu urged, aware her exposure meant three families—possibly excluding the Lü—sought her life.

The Lü clan, led by a matriarch since its lord’s death a decade prior, had withdrawn from conflicts.

“What did you seek at Conghan’s villa? Can I help?”

“A Demon Realm journal I carried for years. It documents arcane lore I’ve barely deciphered. Fully understanding it could break the seal on Zhang Han’s memories.”

“Demon Realm journal?” Guan Yu mused. “Have you heard of the Feng family’s Ten Thousand-Year Demonic Realm?”

“It was mine!” Jin Hua bit savagely into her burger. “The jade allegedly revives the dead, but its origins are unclear. The Fengs seized it during the war.”

“Where’s your journal? I’ll retrieve it.” Guan Yu offered, conflicted—unsealing Zhang Han’s memories might awaken a vengeful demon. Yet Jin Hua’s determination to ally with her against the families risked catastrophic war.

“Rest after eating. I’ll bring dinner and a nurse tonight.” Departing, Guan Yu returned Pan Taisheng’s car before heading to campus.

As he mounted his motorcycle, Wei Hongwei sprinted over. “Boss Guan! Where’ve you been? Your phone’s dead! We nearly called the police!”

“Idiot. If I were in trouble, would cops help?” Guan Yu scoffed.

Unfazed, Wei continued, “The new principal’s another hottie! Liu Hongshuang—she visited your class, cozy with you. Another sister?”

“She’s just a friend.”

“Really? When she asked Lü Mei who she was, your girl thought she’s another mistress! They almost fought!”

Guan Yu winced—Lü Mei’s jealousy was legendary. Entering the classroom, he found her sulking. Presenting lunch from “Aunt Yao,” he charmed her into a steak date at Milan.

Over dinner, Lü Mei suddenly declared, “I want a proper status.” Startled, Guan Yu kissed her, culminating in a passionate encounter. Proposing she move in with A’mei and Xue Jing, he assuaged her worries about parental approval.

Exiting the restaurant, they found thugs surrounding his car. “You Guan Yu? Our boss Cao Jin wants you.”

**Chapter 2041: Settling the Score**

Leading Lü Mei out while explaining Liu Hongshuang’s platonic role, Guan Yu eased her temper. Ravenous, she requested steak at Milan’s private booth.

Mid-meal, Lü Mei dropped her bombshell: “I want acknowledgment.”

Stunned, Guan Yu moved beside her, sealing her lips in a kiss that escalated into fervent intimacy. Afterward, nestled against his chest, she murmured, “I just want to see you daily.”

Suggesting she reside at Qiaoyuan District with A’mei and Xue Jing, he assured her mother could send escorts. Agreeing, Lü Mei clung to him.

Exiting, they confronted green-haired youths eyeing Guan Yu’s car. “Cao Jin wants you,” their leader sneered.
