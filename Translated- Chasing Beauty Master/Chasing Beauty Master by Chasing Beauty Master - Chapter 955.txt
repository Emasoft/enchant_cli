“Absolutely not! You mustn’t wrong an innocent man,” Guan Yu hastily defended himself. “I’d never met her before today. We only became acquainted after you introduced us. Who could’ve imagined I’d suffer such a loss by accidentally letting someone take advantage of me?”

Lin Qiaoqiao flushed with indignation. “Guan Yu, how can you twist things like this? It was just a momentary impulse! How is it ‘suffering a loss’ for you? That was my first kiss! I don’t even know who to hold accountable now. Hmph!”

“If you feel cheated, I can return it,” Guan Yu replied with a teasing grin. “How about I kiss you back? That’ll balance things out.”

Lin Qiaoqiao gaped speechlessly, torn between embarrassment and fury. “Jingjing, what’s wrong with your man? He keeps scheming to take advantage of me! I’m only tolerating this out of respect for you. Anyone else, and I’d have beaten them senseless!”

**Chapter 2442: Such a Raw Deal**

“Could you even beat him?” Xue Jing stifled a laugh behind her hand. “Besides, you kissed my man first. It’s only fair he kisses you back to even the score.”

Lin Qiaoqiao threw up her hands. “Are you all insane? Since when is randomly kissing people normal? I’m done with you!” She plopped into her seat, pouting furiously. The impulsive kiss had already mortified her, and now Guan Yu’s group was mocking her over it. The humiliation burned deeper.

Worse still, she’d kissed another woman’s husband right in front of his three wives. Her heart raced like a startled deer, thudding wildly as she relived the thrill of the moment. The more she dwelled on it, the hotter her cheeks burned…

Watching her, Xue Jing inwardly groaned: *Another one falls.* Lin Qiaoqiao’s expression plainly betrayed her budding interest in Guan Yu. The old Lin Qiaoqiao would’ve flown into a violent rage after such an affront, leaving the offender battered.

Yet here she sat, crimson-faced and silent—shyness incarnate. Xue Jing had never seen her friend so flustered. This bashful reaction spoke volumes: Lin Qiaoqiao wasn’t angry. And lack of anger meant… interest.

Xue Jing glanced at Guan Yu, who calmly comforted Amei—still shaken from Wan Badan’s earlier gun threat. Regret gnawed at Xue Jing. Introducing Lin Qiaoqiao to this ladykiller had been a grave mistake.

Even a fiery temper like Lin Qiaoqiao’s had melted under his charm. *I’ve brought a rival upon myself,* Xue Jing lamented. *This is entirely my fault…*

Among her many friends, Xue Jing had avoided introducing beauties to Guan Yu, knowing they’d inevitably succumb. If this continued, his harem might overflow Qiaoyuan District! She’d assumed Lin Qiaoqiao’s tigress demeanor would repel him, but fate had other plans. Overnight, Lin Qiaoqiao’s attitude toward Guan Yu had transformed.

“This isn’t fair—I’m the real victim here!” Lin Qiaoqiao’s sudden outburst startled everyone.

Guan Yu sighed. “*You’re* the victim? I lost out too! What now? Should I kiss you again to settle it?”

“You shameless jerk! Come near me and I’ll smash your skull!” Lin Qiaoqiao feigned anger, though conflicting emotions churned within. Part of her recoiled, yet another part replayed their kiss.

“Then what do you propose?”

Guan Yu found the situation absurd. Her boldness—though meant to deter Wan Badan—had crossed lines.

After pondering, Lin Qiaoqiao declared, “I don’t care! Since I’m the injured party, Guan Yu should pay for this meal.”

Xue Jing’s eyes widened. “Qiaoqiao, are you daft? Guan Yu doesn’t care about meal money. You’re still getting the short end!”

“Then… what should I do?” Lin Qiaoqiao groaned.

Tonight’s lavish dinner—a heartfelt gesture to thank Guan Yu—had strained her finances. Born to modest shopkeeper parents who’d scrimped to secure her police position through her uncle’s connections, Lin Qiaoqiao lived frugally. This meal likely cost half a month’s salary.

Though Wan Badan might retaliate, her uncle’s influence as precinct captain and her recent merits should shield her.

“Perhaps one more kiss will balance our ledgers,” Guan Yu suggested cheerfully.

Xue Jing intervened urgently, noting Lin Qiaoqiao’s uncharacteristic tolerance. “Qiaoqiao, provoking the deputy commissioner could endanger your job. What if he fires you?”

“He won’t,” Lin Qiaoqiao dismissed. “Wan Badan’s too ashamed to mention tonight’s fiasco. He’ll avoid antagonizing me, fearing I’ll expose him.”

“Let’s hope. Losing your job over this would be tragic,” Xue Jing fretted.

Guan Yu suspected otherwise. A scoundrel like Wan Badan would surely harass Lin Qiaoqiao, possibly implicating her uncle. In this world, crossing superiors never ended well.

Lin Qiaoqiao’s eyes sparkled mischievously. “Exactly! If I get fired, I’ll live off Guan Yu at Qiaoyuan District!”

**Chapter 2443: Reckless Arrogance**

Xue Jing gaped. Lin Qiaoqiao might as well have shouted “I love you, Guan Yu!”

“Qiaoqiao, have you gone love-drunk? Are you tipsy?” Xue Jing shook her friend’s shoulders.

Sensing tension, Guan Yu excused himself to call Pan Taisheng. After arranging protective measures, he returned to find the women merrily drunk. Lin Qiaoqiao, especially inebriated, kept challenging him to drink—a futile effort against his limitless tolerance.

Even teetotaler Amei succumbed, coughing after her first beer. “Blech! Why drink this bitter swill?”

“It grows on you,” Lin Qiaoqiao giggled, equally flushed.

Meanwhile, in VIP Room 9, Wan Badan seethed while fondling his mistress. “Insolent brats! I’ll make them pay!”

Zhao Zhenwang nodded. “Teach that cocky youngster a lesson!”

“None shall escape retribution—especially those bitches in Room 2. Lin Qiaoqiao… your days are numbered.”

As Zhao summoned his secretary Mimi, Pan Taisheng’s bikers lurked outside. Following Guan Yu’s orders, they tailed the Rolls-Royce to Wan’s villa—a luxurious den funded by corruption.

**Chapter 2444: Vile Schemers**

Inside the opulent bedroom, the drug-fueled quartet indulged in depravity. Pan Taisheng scaled the balcony, capturing damning footage through spotless windows. After fifteen minutes of debauchery, he retreated, leaving henchmen to vandalize the gates.

Mimi answered the disturbance, hobbling in a bathrobe. “Who dares cause trouble here?”

“Tell Wan Badan we’ve got a video,” a thug growled. “One wrong move, and it goes viral nationwide.”
