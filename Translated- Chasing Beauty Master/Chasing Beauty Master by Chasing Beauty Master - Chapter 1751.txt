Guan Yu continued, “As our sect leader just stated, we are the Jiayi Sect. Are your ears stuffed with chicken feathers? We have no relation to any Demon Soul Sect or the like.”

The opposing group began murmuring again, resembling a leaderless mob where every decision required communal debate—like casting votes through public discussion.

Having exhausted verbal provocations, Guan Yu’s side noticed their opponents’ earlier arrogance waning, replaced by wariness. This shift was favorable. Retreat was unthinkable for Guan Yu’s group, especially after recognizing their adversaries’ incompetence.

If the opposition withdrew voluntarily, it would save everyone effort. A physical clash, even without casualties, would waste spiritual energy on these unworthy foes—a true squandering of resources.

Guan Yu had no intention of harassing them if they left peacefully. But if they persisted in foolishness, courtesy would be discarded.

“The Jiayi Sect? Never heard of it—likely some insignificant minor sect. We’ve no reason to fear them,” sneered a youth to the middle-aged man beside him, his tone defiant and itching for conflict.

**Chapter 4580: Detour**

“In this land of survival of the fittest, we don’t wish to bully the few with our numbers. Simply step aside, leave your supplies, and we might avoid bloodshed,” declared the middle-aged man after their huddled discussion.

Instead of retreating, the demand escalated—not only passage but their provisions too. Absurdity incarnate.

“If you truly oppose ganging up on us, why not match our numbers? One-on-one duels!” Xiao Mei taunted.

“Do you understand the meaning of ‘overestimating yourselves’?” Guan Yu said coolly. “Even conversing with you drains my energy. This is your final warning: return. The desert isn’t for your kind.”

As he spoke, Guan Yu drew his Soulfall Blade. Xiao Mei instinctively edged away, unsettled by the weapon’s aura—a primal fear stemming from her serpentine nature, though she couldn’t explain why.

Done with diplomacy, Guan Yu resolved to teach them a lesson and resume their journey. Before the opposition could react, his blade blazed under the sun, unleashing a Qi Slash that struck the ground between both parties. Sand erupted skyward before pelting down on their foes, sowing panic.

The once-flat desert now bore a three-meter-deep chasm, impassable save by flight. This display aimed to deter further aggression, rendering their path blocked.

Trembling, the adversaries gaped at the fissure. Such power! Engaging him directly meant certain defeat.

“They’re bluffing!” the youth insisted. “Only their leader is strong. Overwhelm him, and the rest will crumble!” His inexperience showed—relying on numbers rather than wisdom.

Guan Yu issued a final ultimatum: retreat or face annihilation, regardless of any ties to the Yunqing Sect.

“Heed this warning,” Xiao Mei declared, chin lifted. “Henceforth, steer clear of the Jiayi Sect. Consequences await those who defy us.” Guan Yu’s display bolstered her confidence—with such a guardian, the desert held no terrors.

“Think us cowards?” the youth retorted. “We outnumber you twofold! A single collective spell could obliterate your pathetic sect. Arrogant upstarts!”

The middle-aged man remained silent, scrutinizing Guan Yu’s blade. Recognition dawned—this was no ordinary weapon but a potent spiritual artifact. Rubies along its spine and hilt glowed with stored energy.

“Wait!” the middle-aged man interjected as the youth prepared to attack. “Though few, they aren’t to be trifled with. Let us detour peacefully.” He gestured retreat.

“Uncle Wen! You’d shame the Gaoshan Sect?” the youth protested.

“Discretion prevails,” the elder replied firmly, masking his true reason—the artifact’s threat. “They aren’t our enemies. Cease this folly.”

“But their insults! Must we swallow this humiliation?” The pampered sect heir, unaccustomed to defiance, flushed crimson.

“Temporary retreat ensures calm. Provoking them risks disaster.” The elder invoked their mission’s priority, threatening to send the youth back.

Humiliated before the crowd, the youth snapped, “You’re my father’s lapdog! I’ll settle this later!”

Guan Yu smirked at their infighting but prioritized departure. “Ready? We move.”

“Coward! Letting them escape tarnishes our sect’s honor!” the youth raged, restrained only by the chasm.

**Chapter 4581: Revelations**

The youth was the Gaoshan Sect leader’s spoiled heir, shielded by a doting mother. The middle-aged man, a senior hall master, barked, “Cease this! Their leader wields a high-grade artifact. Its mere presence signals our inferiority. Engage, and we perish.”

Overhearing, Guan Yu approved the elder’s discernment. Had they fought, annihilation would’ve followed, Yunqing Sect ties notwithstanding.

Cowed yet seething, the youth spat, “Gaoshan needs no cowardice! This isn’t over!”

Guan Yu’s group proceeded unscathed, while the fractured Gaoshan contingent faced bleak prospects—even if they found Miao City, defeat loomed.

“What’s ahead?” Xiao Mei paused, eyeing distant figures. Evening’s approach offered cooler travel, the harsh noon sun replaced by milder light.

Nearing suspected Miao City coordinates, encounters multiplied. Guan Yu urged urgency—the lunar seventh month’s fifteenth day approached, their deadline.

“Ask me? I’m as lost as you,” Xiao Mei shrugged. “But increased activity suggests we’re close.”

Ahead lay the only viable route between massive dunes. Detouring meant arduous traversal. “We advance,” Guan Yu decided. “Assess that group cautiously.”

As they prepared, Wang Jun pointed left. “Ruins!”

A weathered stone wall protruded from sands—unlike typical wooden desert structures. The party investigated, finding more remnants hinting at a forgotten settlement.

**Chapter 4582: Enigma**

“A village? Or fortress?” Guan Yu mused. Centuries-old debris suggested a lost tribe. Xiao Mei, six centuries old yet preoccupied with cultivation, knew little.

“Stone construction here is odd,” Guan Yu noted. “Who built this?”

Before speculation deepened, scouts from the ahead group approached. “Identify yourselves!” they demanded.

“You first!” Xiao Mei retorted, irked by their rudeness.

Guan Yu recognized their attire—identical to the Gaoshan Sect’s. Two riders atop camels watched from a dune, their garb unmistakable. The cycle of confrontation threatened renewal.
