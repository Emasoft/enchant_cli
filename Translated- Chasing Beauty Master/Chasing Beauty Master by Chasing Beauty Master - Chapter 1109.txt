“Though Poison Widow had sought his help, Yuan Shanding had yet to assist her in any substantial way, which weighed heavily on his conscience. After a moment’s contemplation, he said, ‘Young Master Bill, perhaps this is for the best. I can no longer continue aiding you, but I can introduce a friend of mine. His capabilities are extraordinary, and with his assistance, your efforts will surely yield twice the results with half the effort.’”

“In his anxious state, Bill Lin was momentarily stunned before hastily asking, ‘Truly? Where is this friend of yours now?’”

“‘He isn’t a local,’ Yuan Shanding replied, ‘but if I personally invite him, it shouldn’t be an issue. Please wait a day or two, Young Master Bill.’”

“‘Excellent! May I ask who this esteemed friend of yours is?’ Bill Lin inquired, eager yet cautious.”

“Yuan Shanding settled into a wooden chair and calmly stated, ‘You must have heard of the Ten Great Villains of the jianghu. Poison Widow is one of them.’”

“‘Of course I’ve heard of them. So far, three have surfaced. The first is Lady Yingshan—a woman as venomous as a scorpion. After obtaining a treasure map from Guan Yu, she vanished without a trace. The second is Sky Soaring Wolf, who also secured a treasure map from Houyuan Temple but met his end due to insatiable greed.’ Bill Lin lit a cigarette, exhaling a plume of smoke. ‘The third is Poison Widow herself. She was the first of the Ten Great Villains to ally with me. Initially, Young Master Fang Su of the Fang family was my ally. To counter Guan Yu, Fang Su brought in his aunt—Poison Widow. Yet the Fang family fell to ruin, and Guan Yu’s ruthless tactics nearly claimed her life. It was only through my exhaustive efforts that she was saved.’”

“Bill Lin spoke as though he were a paragon of virtue, framing himself as the orchestrator of every success while distancing himself from any misdeeds. Yuan Shanding listened without objection, aware that flattery would serve his purposes better in the absence of dissenters.”

“Through recent interactions, Bill Lin had discerned Yuan Shanding’s character—a man who, though no saint, was not wholly wicked. Yuan Shanding possessed a streak of kindness, prompting Bill Lin to employ both coercion and coaxing to retain him.”

“‘After Poison Widow sought my aid, matters escalated to this point,’ Yuan Shanding continued. ‘However, the friend I intend to summon is different. Though also one of the Ten Great Villains, his true identity remains shrouded in mystery.’”

“‘Another of the Ten Great Villains, yet so enigmatic? Who is he?’ Bill Lin pressed, curiosity piqued.”

“‘He is known in the jianghu as the Masked Ghost,’ Yuan Shanding revealed. ‘His prowess lies not only in his formidable cultivation but also in his mastery of disguise. His illusions leave opponents utterly defenseless.’”

“Bill Lin’s eyes gleamed with anticipation. Even if Yuan Shanding departed, the introduction of such an ally softened the blow of recent setbacks. ‘I’ll contact him shortly and ensure he arrives posthaste,’ Yuan Shanding added. ‘Offer him monetary incentives, and he will undoubtedly deliver results.’”

“‘Money is no obstacle if he proves valuable,’ Bill Lin chuckled, buoyed by the prospect of a new strategy against Guan Yu.”

“Later, news reached Guan Yu that Yuan Shanding had dutifully withdrawn with his subordinates—over fifty men—via a chartered bus back to ** Mountain. Though Bill Lin had offered transportation from the Feng family’s fleet, Yuan Shanding declined, citing concerns over Guan Yu’s spies in Western Zhou. A conspicuous convoy might arouse suspicion.”

“Chapter 2,838: Concealment”

“Ordinarily, Bill Lin would have seethed at Yuan Shanding’s departure, yet he feigned indifference to maintain appearances. Guan Yu, wary of the abrupt peace, dispatched agents to tail the bus and chart its route, ensuring preparedness for future contingencies. Verification confirmed Yuan Shanding’s full retreat, leaving no trace in the Feng estate.”

“With the Feng family patriarch recalled and Jiu Biyun discreetly returned to the Yang family’s private clinic—relocated for added security—Guan Yu’s vigilance remained unshaken. Though Jones’s hideout offered greater safety, the clinic’s medical facilities better served Jiu Biyun’s recovery. Bill Lin, aware that harming her now would only incriminate himself, abandoned further schemes against her.”

“Days of relative calm followed. One evening, Guan Yu visited the Flower Night Club with Xue Jing, where Hou Jinshun greeted him with a bottle of red wine, oblivious to Xue Jing’s presence as he launched into conversation.”

“Since the restroom murder incident, the club had tightened security without dampening its lively atmosphere. Unlike typical rowdy venues, it thrived on patronage from those aware of its influential backing.”

“Lowering his voice, Hou Jinshun asked, ‘Have you heard? Another treasure map has surfaced.’”

“Guan Yu feigned surprise. The map was his own creation—a bait to lure hidden foes from the shadows. ‘Another one? Where?’ he probed.”

“‘An old farmer claimed to have unearthed a wooden box in his field,’ Hou Jinshun recounted. ‘Inside was an ancient hide—a treasure map sold to a pawnshop for 1.5 million. The fool celebrated here, drunk and loose-lipped.’”

“‘A pity,’ Guan Yu remarked. ‘At auction, it’d fetch ten times that.’”

“‘Why not buy it back?’ Xue Jing interjected, playfully feigning ignorance.”

“‘The pawnshop knows its worth,’ Guan Yu explained. ‘Retrieving it now would cost dearly. Let others squabble over it.’”

“Hou Jinshun fretted, ‘What if someone completes the set?’”

“‘Let Bill Lin stew in paranoia,’ Guan Yu shrugged. ‘He dares not step outside without an army. We’ll act when the time is ripe.’”

“Their discussion was interrupted by a commotion. A burly man with a gold chain berated a slender youth in a white suit for spilling his drink. Hou Jinshun mediated, offering complimentary drinks as peace offerings.”

“Observing the youth, Guan Yu sensed an enigmatic cultivator. ‘His aura is... unusual,’ Xue Jing murmured.”

“Hou Jinshun later introduced the white-suited man. ‘This is Guan Yu, my mentor.’”

“‘An honor,’ the man smiled, extending a hand. ‘I’ve long admired your reputation.’”
