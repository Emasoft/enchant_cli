“Might there be?” Liu Shilei arched her delicate willow-leaf brows, her heart already somewhat enlightened. She continued questioning: “What about Li Xi?”

“Li Xi?” Guan Yu’s eyelids twitched violently. Then he answered with righteous fervor and absolute certainty: “That one—absolutely not!”

“Truly none?” Liu Shilei was slightly taken aback by Guan Yu’s reaction and countered.

“This… truly none!” Guan Yu reaffirmed resolutely.

Liu Shilei sighed softly and fell silent, evidently believing Guan Yu’s words. She knew at this point, he had no reason to deceive her.

For reasons unknown, just as Feng Xin felt profound crisis upon meeting Liu Shilei, Liu Shilei herself now experienced a sense of peril upon hearing Guan Yu’s inclinations toward Feng Xin and Gao Wei.

Though Guan Yu merely harbored goodwill toward them, as Liu Shilei gradually recognized his excellence, she harbored no doubt these affections could evolve into substantive relationships. She believed her man’s worth!

Seeing the contemplative look and faint worry etched between Liu Shilei’s brows, Guan Yu’s heart ached faintly.

Here lay this nearly flawless woman before him, yet he still entertained thoughts of others—what scoundrel would do such a thing?

**Chapter 716: Encountering Tycoons While House Hunting**

The future brimmed with unknowns. Even with his supernatural abilities, Guan Yu couldn’t guarantee outcomes. But one certainty burned within him: no matter what transpired, he’d cherish this selfless woman before him.

Burdened by guilt, Guan Yu pulled Liu Shilei tightly against him, burying his face in her fragrant tresses, greedily inhaling her warmth.

After a long moment, Liu Shilei lifted her gaze. “Guan Yu, should I move into your place?”

“Yes!” Guan Yu answered without hesitation, adding: “Tomorrow we’ll view houses!”

Liu Shilei laughed—a deep, joyous laughter—tears glistening at her lids before cascading down her cheeks onto Guan Yu’s broad chest.

She understood the implications: Guan Yu was offering her legitimacy, a home bearing her name.

Though other women might dwell in this household, she alone held the rightful title. This sufficed.

As Guan Yu’s influence grew—perhaps beyond his own reckoning—he trusted Luo Cheng’s capabilities wouldn’t disappoint.

True to form, Luo Cheng acted swiftly. When Guan Yu mentioned seeking new lodgings, Luo Cheng called that very night.

Hanging up, Guan Yu wore an odd expression.

“No suitable houses?” Liu Shilei asked anxiously.

Guan Yu shook his head.

“Too expensive?” she pressed. “I’ve savings for a mid-range home’s down payment. We’ll manage the rest gradually.”

Guan Yu’s gaze softened. “You’ll see tomorrow.”

The next day, they visited Tianyu Villa Complex—N City’s premier estate for the wealthy.

A portly middle-aged man with a heavily made-up young woman perused properties nearby.

“Darling, this villa’s understated luxury matches my taste,” the woman cooed. “Only three million—let’s buy it!”

“Done!” The tycoon declared, lecherous eyes glued to her cleavage.

As the couple kissed, the man’s gaze snagged on the newcomers—specifically Liu Shilei’s striking beauty.

**Chapter 717: Covetous Intent**

Money corrupts—yet women adore wealthy rogues. Such was reality.

Chen Xiaoyu adored her sugar daddy who’d gifted her a three-million villa. Now scheming to claim ownership, her gaze turned venomous toward Liu Shilei.

“Sweetheart, see that woman?” The tycoon groped Chen’s buttock, nodding toward Liu Shilei. “I want her.”

Chen’s eyes flashed jealousy. “She might be trouble—they’re here buying villas. Wealthy backgrounds?”

“Wealthy? Pa!” The tycoon sneered. “Poor lovebirds playing house.”

**Chapter 718: The Tycoon Wants Your Friendship**

“Beauty matched with villa—perfection!” a voice interrupted.

Guan Yu turned, scowling. “Your balls ache or kidneys hurt?”

The tycoon flushed. “Say that again!”

“Only idiots spout ‘villas suit beauties’,” Guan Yu scoffed.

Chen intervened: “Darling, why lower yourself?”

The tycoon turned to Liu Shilei, oozing false charm. “Madam, seeking property?”

Liu Shilei frowned but nodded politely.

“Excellent!” The tycoon beamed. “Let’s discuss… privately.”
