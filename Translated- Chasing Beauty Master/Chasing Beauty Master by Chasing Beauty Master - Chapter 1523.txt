Xuanming looked at Elder Xiang with frustration. “This isn’t about whether it’s related or not. The problem is, you lost the bet with Guanyu, didn’t you? And I was the referee at the time. Now he’s sent me to collect. Shouldn’t you at least honor your word?”

Elder Xiang retorted, “I treat Guanyu like a child. I never intended to take him seriously. If I refused to acknowledge the bet, do you think I’d lose?” Xuanming nearly groaned at his shamelessness. The man’s audacity was truly unparalleled.

“Let me ask you this,” Xuanming said sharply. “If Guanyu had lost that day and his wager was the Imperial Seal, but afterward he reneged, claiming it was all a joke, and refused to hand it over—what would you have done?”

Elder Xiang’s eyes flashed. *He wouldn’t dare. I’d split his skull on the spot!* But he swallowed those words, knowing Xuanming was cornering him. Instead, he forced a conciliatory smile. “Guanyu’s just a child. Why would I stoop to his level? Even if he’d lost, I wouldn’t have demanded the Imperial Seal.”

The lie hung thickly between them. Of course Elder Xiang would have claimed his prize—but history favored the victor, and he felt no need to dwell on hypotheticals. Xuanming sighed deeply, leaning back in his chair. “This is giving me a headache. Guanyu’s hounding me to collect, but you’re reneging. What am I supposed to do?”

“Furthermore,” he pressed, “Guanyu now demands to bring Xiao Zhi to the desert. He insists you purge Xiao’s Blood Toxin first. As you well know, among our new disciples, only Guanyu has the capability to confront the Demon Soul Sect in the desert. Without him, we’re lost.”

Xuanming’s frustration mounted. He briefly considered sacrificing fifty years of cultivation himself—a bitter pill, but perhaps necessary.

“Clearly, you’re unworthy of this Black Ironstone.” Xuanming stood abruptly, snatching the dark metallic ore from the table. “I’ll find another way. Maybe this can offset fifty years’ cultivation after all.” The blatant reversal—offering the treasure only to reclaim it—was a masterstroke.

“Elder Brother Sect Leader, wait!” Elder Xiang scrambled to his feet. “You promised this ironstone to me earlier! How can you go back on your word? As Yunqing Sect’s leader, shouldn’t you keep your promises?”

“And you, an Elder, break vows like passing wind!” Xuanming snapped. “My face burns with shame for you. If you can cheat, why can’t I reconsider? Keep your lousy iron ruler. This isn’t for you.” His voice turned icy. “Guanyu will come for you eventually. When he does, don’t expect my help. This mess is your doing.”

He strode toward the door but deliberately slowed his pace, muttering loudly, “Hopeless. I’d planned to secure you a second ironstone. Two could forge a peerless artifact... but clearly, it’s wasted effort.”

“Wait!” The mention of a second ironstone struck home. Elder Xiang’s resolve wavered. Such treasures came once in a century—two were beyond rare. Fifty years’ cultivation, though substantial, could be regained. But these stones...

“Elder Brother,” he entreated, “let’s discuss this over tea. No need for haste.”

Xuanming turned, sensing an opening. “What now? I must persuade Guanyu to proceed. If he refuses, your Left Void Peak disciples will go to the desert instead.”

Elder Xiang blanched. The desert meant certain death for his disciples. Forcing calm, he gestured to the tea set. “Please, sit. This tea from Elder Lu is exquisite. You mentioned Guanyu refuses the mission unless Xiao Zhi accompanies him?”

After a deliberate sip, he continued, “This is unacceptable. Xiao Zhi’s loyalties remain unconfirmed. What if he flees like Yan Zhao did?”

“Xiao is different,” Xuanming countered, savoring the bitter brew. “Elder Zheng vouches for him, and Elder Lu stakes his life on it. There’s no demonic taint—I’d stake my own reputation.”

Chapter 3950: A Game

Xuanming pressed his advantage. “Consider this trade—fifty years’ cultivation for two ironstones. A worthy exchange, no? A superior artifact outweighs mere cultivation years. Your combat prowess wouldn’t diminish.”

Elder Xiang knew the truth in this. A top-tier artifact could match fifty years’ power, and cultivation could be regained. But the stones... “You promised the ironstone earlier. How can you renege?”

“Must I spell it out?” Xuanming’s glare held contempt. “The choice is yours—stones or cultivation. Decide.”

After agonizing calculation, Elder Xiang relented. The stones’ value outweighed his pride. “Very well. But I’ll need your help refining them post-treatment.”

“Naturally,” Xuanming agreed, relief flooding him. The matter was settled.

Chapter 3951: Allocation

Days later, in Bamboo Peak’s confinement chamber, Xiao Zhi knelt trembling as Elder Xiang entered with entourage. “The Blood Toxin purge begins now,” the Elder declared. “Prepare yourself.”

Elder Lu explained, “This will excise the poison through Elder Xiang’s fifty-year cultivation infusion. The pain will be... considerable.”

Xiao bowed deeply. “My thanks, honored Elders. And to Young Master Guanyu—”

“Save gratitude for survival,” Elder Xiang cut in. With Elder Lu safeguarding the process, the brutal purification commenced.

Meanwhile, Guanyu awaited news at his workshop, crafting a hand crossbow for Wang Jun. When summoned by Xuanming, he learned of Xiao’s successful treatment. “He convalesces now,” the Sect Leader reported. “The desert mission proceeds once he recovers.”

“My thanks, Master.” Guanyu produced an ironstone. “For Elder Xiang’s artifact. May it humble him.”

As Xuanming departed with the stone, Guanyu contemplated securing another for Wang Jun’s weapon. Her current blade paled against demonic threats. With Elder Jiu’s craftsmanship... possibilities abounded.

In the forge’s glow, Wang Jun labored obsessively over her crossbow. Gold-reinforced bolts took shape—compact, dense, lethal. Sleep forgotten, she envisioned desert battles where this weapon would prove its worth.

Two days hence, as Xiao Zhi awoke weakened but cleansed, Guanyu examined the finished crossbow. Its mechanism clicked with deadly precision. “To the desert then,” he murmured. “Let the Demon Soul Sect tremble.”
