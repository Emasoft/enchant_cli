“Chu Fan, handle things here yourselves first. Do not let a single person leave. I will report to the authorities immediately, declaring every one of you suspects. They will all be arrested on the spot, leaving no chance for escape. If the culprit does not step forward, everyone will suffer together!”

Guan Yu continued fiercely: “Then I’ll visit the Cao family. I’ll beg Master Cao for mercy and offer him terms he cannot refuse. Even the East Sea Dragon Pearl is within my means to procure. Appeasing Master Cao won’t be difficult. Once he reveals the traitor’s name, we’ll have our answer.”

Admittedly, Guan Yu’s approach was ruthless yet brilliant. To uncover the saboteur, he was willing to humble himself before Master Cao, offering lavish concessions until satisfied. Information extracted from the Cao patriarch would be irrefutable.

Chu Fan stood motionless, scanning the crowd before suddenly asking, “Xiao Liu—have you gambled recently?” The abrupt question made the young man named Xiao Liu tremble violently.

Among the crowd stood a short, wiry youth as thin as a twig—utterly unremarkable. This was Xiao Liu, whom Chu Fan had addressed.

In the troupe, Xiao Liu played minor roles—animals, props, or background figures. His ability to perform acrobatics and somersaults made him a diligent performer. Generally well-liked, he maintained decent relationships with all.

Yet Xiao Liu harbored one fatal flaw: a gambling addiction. Outside rehearsals and performances, he haunted gambling dens. Even penniless, he’d linger to watch others play, finding perverse satisfaction.

A slave to chance, he’d sooner stake his last coin than buy a decent meal. As Chu Fan pondered earlier, Master Cao would target someone with vulnerabilities. Xiao Liu’s addiction made him prime for bribery.

Thus, Chu Fan’s first suspect was clear.

Stammering under scrutiny, Xiao Liu replied, “T-Troupe Leader, I haven’t gambled in ages! Rehearsals have kept me too busy lately!”

Chu Fan recalled Xiao Liu’s frequent presence these past days—it seemed plausible he’d abstained.

Guan Yu doubted mere questioning would yield truths. The sabotage likely occurred over the past two nights, given his feud with the Cao family began two days prior.

“Xiao Liu,” Guan Yu interjected, “what did you do after dusk two nights ago?”

“I... I don’t remember well. After dinner, I rested briefly, then strolled with Da Gang,” Xiao Liu quavered.

“And last night?” Guan Yu pressed. “The perfect window for sabotage. Surely you didn’t wander alone again?”

“W-we rehearsed all afternoon yesterday. After dinner, I went straight to bed. Never left my room!” Xiao Liu’s voice shook.

Chapter 4822: Prime Suspect

Guan Yu nodded skeptically. A claim of solitary sleep lacked witnesses. His suspicions hardened—the stage had been intact during yesterday’s rehearsal. Destruction must have come overnight.

Methodically, Guan Yu began interrogating everyone’s whereabouts. Three suspects emerged without alibis. The deputy troupe leader and others had been drinking late together, eliminating them.

Guilt gnawed at Guan Yu. His feud with the Cao family had brought disaster upon Scarlet Beauty Theater. He vowed to unmask the traitor.

Finally, Guan Yu fixed on Xiao Liu. “If I’m right, Cao’s people paid your gambling debts. Recall—Troupe Leader Chu paid months’ wages two days ago. Where’s your silver now?”

Cornered, Xiao Liu panicked as all eyes turned. “I... lost it gambling! But that was two nights back! Last night I truly slept alone!”

“You didn’t sleep!” Guan Yu thundered. “You were beneath the stage with a saw! Admit it!”

“I swear it wasn’t me! I’ve been here years—why betray everyone?” Xiao Liu pleaded desperately.

“Loyalty crumbles before sufficient silver,” Chu Fan observed coolly. “Confess now—your guilt is plain.”

Guan Yu added, “Others have witnesses. Only you and two gravely injured lack alibis. Would they sabotage themselves? You’re the sole suspect!”

“Vile creature!” The deputy leader roared, jabbing a finger. “I treated you as kin! You’re lower than beasts!”

Guan Yu reconstructed events: After settling with Chu Fan two days prior, wages were distributed. Xiao Liu, owing debts, gambled his entire pay that night. Cao’s agents pounced, entrapping him with loans until he agreed to sabotage.

Under cover of night, while others drank, Xiao Liu sawed through stage supports using Cao-provided iron rods.

Chapter 4823: Bitter Enmity

As Guan Yu finished, Xiao Liu collapsed. The deputy leader recalled: “Last night, drunkenly relieving myself, I glimpsed a skinny figure near the stage. I thought nothing of it—until now!”

Xiao Liu fell to his knees, sobbing: “I had no choice! The debts... they threatened jail! I’m too young for prison—no wife yet! Spare me!”

“I’ll kill you myself!” The deputy leader kicked Xiao Liu sprawling. Others surged forward, fists raised.

“Enough!” Chu Fan barked. “Killing him solves nothing.”

“Drag him to the magistrates!” someone shouted. “This wretch nearly crippled me!” cried another injured performer.

As the mob converged, Xiao Liu bolted. Guan Yu channeled his inner qi, light as a swallow treading air as he pursued. Upon catching up, he mercilessly kicked Xiao Liu squarely in the back of the head.

The mob descended, beating the prone figure. Guan Yu intervened: “Stay your hands. He may yet prove useful against Cao.”

“Better dead than treacherous!” spat the deputy.

“Murder brings its own reckoning,” Guan Yu countered. “My fight is with Cao. Preserve him as a witness.”

Hauling up the bloodied youth, Guan Yu addressed the troupe: “My quarrel drew Cao’s wrath here. Take these funds to rebuild Scarlet Beauty Theater grander than before. I’ll bankroll full renovations.”

Though resentment lingered, Guan Yu’s silver tempered outrage. Chu Fan limped forward: “We’re bound to you now. But Cao’s power dwarfs ours. Reconsider this feud.”

Guan Yu sneered, “Cao’s but a gnat to me. Keep this wretch alive—he’ll serve our purpose.” After arranging repairs, Guan Yu departed to gather funds and allies, plotting Cao’s downfall through their business vulnerabilities. First, he’d consult Jiang Yuankai—the merchant surely knew Cao’s weak points.

Chapter 4824: Return

Bringing down a colossus like Cao demanded strategy, not brute force. Guan Yu resolved to dismantle their enterprises systematically. But first, intelligence was key—and Jiang Yuankai held the answers.
