When Fang Ding arrived, Fang Su hastily ended his phone call and asked, “Sis, how did it go? Guan Yu didn’t give you any trouble, did he?”

Fang Ding nodded and handed him a voice recorder. “This is what Guan Yu gave me. Listen to it yourself, then decide what to do.”

“What’s this?” Fang Su asked suspiciously. If Guan Yu had provided it, it couldn’t be anything good—so why bother listening?

“The recording will clarify something important. Just hear it out.” Without another word, Fang Ding turned and walked to her room. Fang Su muttered behind her, “What’s all this secrecy? Sis seems off today.”

**Chapter 2503: Secrets and Mysteries**

Driven by curiosity, Fang Su pressed play. The crisp voice of Gao Bing emerged, but the content made his pulse quicken. By the end, his face had paled, cold sweat beading on his forehead. The implications were catastrophic—if leaked, the Fang family would face ruin.

Knowing Gao Bing was currently discussing matters with his father downstairs, Fang Su wrestled with whether to disclose this. Ultimately, he decided he had no choice—such a weighty matter required Patriarch Fang’s judgment.

Clutching the recorder, Fang Su rushed downstairs. Patriarch Fang, noticing his son’s ashen face, asked urgently, “What’s wrong? Are you ill?”

Gao Bing, seizing the chance to flatter, chimed in, “The young master must be exhausted from overwork. He needs rest.”

“Steward Gao, please leave. I need to speak with Father privately,” Fang Su said, steadying his voice.

“Huh?” Gao Bing exchanged a puzzled glance with Patriarch Fang. Typically, the patriarch dismissed others to confer with Gao Bing, his most trusted aide and maternal uncle. The patriarch had intentionally shielded his children from family affairs, believing them too young.

Patriarch Fang, though perplexed by his son’s urgency, nodded. “Lao Gao, step out for now.”

Gao Bing shot Fang Su a questioning look. Normally, Fang Su sought his help to conceal misdeeds from the patriarch. Why the sudden secrecy? Baffled, he complied.

Once alone, Patriarch Fang pressed, “Xiao Su, what’s this about? Something you can’t share openly?”

Hands trembling, Fang Su passed him the recorder. “Father, listen—is this truly our family’s doing?”

Though rarely involved in the family’s shadowy enterprises, Fang Su knew their illicit dealings. But this—counterfeit trafficking in China—could destroy them if exposed.

“What’s all the mystery?” Patriarch Fang scoffed, pressing play. Gao Bing’s voice filled the room. Within moments, the patriarch slammed pause, aghast. “Where did you get this? Summon Gao Bing—now!”

“Hear it all first,” Fang Su urged calmly.

**Chapter 2504: Buying Time**

By the recording’s end, Patriarch Fang erupted in fury. “The last voice—Guan Yu?!”

Fang Su nodded. “He gave this to Sis. Gao Bing has betrayed more than this.”

“That bastard!” The patriarch hurled the recorder to the floor, shattering it. “This can’t get out! I’ll have Guan Yu killed!”

Fang Su intercepted his father’s call. “Father, think! Guan Yu wants us panicked. He extorted three million for a useless steward. He may not even release these—we can buy the recordings back. If he does leak them, we’ll claim Gao Bing framed us. Without evidence, we’re safe.”

Patriarch Fang gradually calmed. “True. We’ll halt operations, destroy evidence. They’ll find nothing.” He clasped his son’s shoulder proudly. “You’ve your father’s shrewdness. The family’s future is secure with you.”

“We must interrogate Gao Bing first,” Fang Su advised. But when they called, Gao Bing’s phone was off.

“He’s fleeing!” Fang Su realized. Indeed, Gao Bing—spotting the recorder earlier—had grabbed essentials and vanished. The Fang family’s frantic search proved futile. His disappearance loomed as a ticking bomb.

Meanwhile, Fang Ding believed resolving the crisis hinged on retrieving Guan Yu’s recordings. She resolved to negotiate with him.

**Chapter 2505: Feasts and Futures**

Elsewhere, Guan Yu addressed his gang, the Yu Faction, before a chest of three million cash. “This is our collective reward. Let’s allocate funds: participants receive bonuses scaled by contribution, others get a flat sum. Then”—cheers erupted—“feast tonight! Decorate this place properly—it’s our headquarters now!”

Amidst jubilation, Guan Yu delegated tasks: purchasing vehicles, renovating the warehouse, and preparing for tomorrow’s auction at the Yang family’s downtown high-rise. By 2 a.m., he departed with Xue Jing, needing rest for the event.

At dawn, crowds swarmed the Yang auction house—a subterranean complex beneath a bustling business tower. While elites with invitations or purchased tickets accessed the underground hall, others crowded a cinema-turned-viewing area upstairs. Security ensured only qualified bidders entered, their wealth verified, tickets costing ten thousand yuan each. The air buzzed with anticipation, all eyes on the rumored treasure map—today’s crown jewel.
