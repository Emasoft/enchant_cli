The young man nodded lazily. It didn’t matter if he told Guan Yu this, because in his eyes, Guan Yu was still a dead man—merely one who would die slightly later. He didn’t mind letting Guan Yu understand his fate before perishing.

“Who sent you? Who are you?” Guan Yu pressed further.

Upon learning he was the target, Guan Yu glanced toward Zhao Jing’er’s direction, a pang of guilt stirring within him.

“I’m an assassin. I cannot reveal my employer’s identity, even to someone about to die. It’s a matter of principle,” the young man replied solemnly, his expression turning grave.

A killer’s dignity was his life.

But then he smiled again. “However, I can tell you who I am, so you’ll know whose hands you fell to. My name is Lin Dong.”

**Chapter 408: The Time Bomb**

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow and smirked. “Are you so certain you can kill me right now?”

Lin Dong replied flatly, “Since becoming an assassin, I’ve never failed. I never allow myself to fail.”

Guan Yu nearly rolled his eyes. *This assassin isn’t cold—just overly confident.*

But Guan Yu was equally self-assured. Refusing to back down, he challenged, “Come and try.”

“Oh?” Lin Dong moved instantly.

Guan Yu’s pupils contracted sharply. Lin Dong’s speed far exceeded his expectations. This was the first time he’d seen someone achieve such velocity without relying on a gravity-defying system like his own. His estimation of Lin Dong rose several notches.

To Guan Yu’s relief, Lin Dong didn’t brandish a pistol like the men in the Mercedes earlier. *That would’ve been nerve-wracking.* Still, he remained wary, wondering if Lin Dong carried a hidden firearm to deploy mid-fight.

Lin Dong did indeed have a gun, but he deemed Guan Yu unworthy of its use. Though Guan Yu’s performance surprised him, it didn’t warrant genuine concern.

As Lin Dong lunged, Guan Yu activated his gravity system again. His body lightened, his speed matching Lin Dong’s—even edging slightly ahead.

Lin Dong’s mind reeled. He knew the agony it had taken to hone his speed, yet Guan Yu surpassed him effortlessly. A competitive fire ignited. This mission had become intriguing—far from the boredom he’d anticipated.

In a blink, they collided.

Lin Dong’s moves were unadorned yet precise, each strike terrifyingly powerful. His combat experience dwarfed Guan Yu’s rookie skills. Only by employing Bone-Shattering Fist did Guan Yu avoid utter humiliation. But as the fight dragged on, his awe grew. *How is this human so monstrous?*

From start to finish, Lin Dong maintained relentless aggression. Finally, he landed a crushing blow to Guan Yu’s chest.

Guan Yu gritted his teeth, opting for mutual destruction—he slammed his fist into Lin Dong’s torso. With his healing system, he could recover instantly by draining a few electric batons. This was his only path to victory.

Their fists struck simultaneously. Both staggered backward.

Every fiber of Guan Yu’s body screamed in pain. Years of farm labor had forged his physique, yet Lin Dong’s hammer-like blows surpassed even Old Feng’s might. By comparison, Lin Dong’s arrogance was justified. Without his coin’s supernatural aid, Guan Yu would’ve perished long ago.

Silently activating his healing system, Guan Yu felt the upgraded system mend his aches with minimal energy expenditure. Soon, he stood unscathed.

Lin Dong, however, clutched his congested chest. That Guan Yu remained standing after his full-force strike was astonishing.

Now, Lin Dong began regarding Guan Yu seriously—his speed, explosive power, and willingness to trade blows marked him as the most intriguing opponent in years.

Rubbing his sternum, Lin Dong openly praised, “You’ve surprised me today. Failure doesn’t exist in my lexicon. I’ll follow you to Jingdu until the job’s done. We’ll meet again.”

With that, Lin Dong vaulted into his Hummer. The engine roared as he shot Guan Yu a meaningful smile and sped away.

Guan Yu wanted to eliminate this walking time bomb, but Lin Dong’s abrupt exit left no opening. It showcased the assassin’s terrifying experience and intellect.

The thought of being hunted in Jingdu made Guan Yu’s scalp prickle. Part of him wanted to cancel the trip, but trouble avoided only fermented. Better confront Lin Dong head-on.

A puzzle lingered: Why had Lin Dong retreated when he could’ve pressed the attack or used his gun? The answer came with thunderous rotorblades overhead.

Looking up, Guan Yu spotted a green military helicopter descending—Fang Zhe’s reinforcements had arrived. His eyelid twitched. Lin Dong had detected the distant threat and fled moments before exposure. *Such preternatural awareness! Does he have千里眼 or顺风耳? Or something like my coin?*

The helicopter’s swift arrival and Lin Dong’s split-second escape timing chilled Guan Yu. The deeper he pondered, the more Lin Dong’s menace grew.

*And I haven’t even reached Jingdu yet. What other dangers await there?*

Suddenly, this journey felt infinitely more complex than he’d imagined.

But Guan Yu wasn’t one to cower. Fortune favored the bold. Once his power and influence grew, even gods and buddhas would fall before him—let alone a mere Lin Dong.

Indeed, this trip would mark a pivotal turning point in Guan Yu’s rise.

**Chapter 409: Zhongnanhai**

The first to rappel down was Fang Zhe, scanning the surroundings with professional vigilance.

Seeing the crumpled Mercedes and burning Hummer, his chest tightened. Though absent during the battle, the wreckage spoke volumes about its ferocity. Relief washed over him—Guan Yu and Zhao Jing’er were alive.

He hurried over to find Guan Yu crouched, intently examining Zhao Jing’er. Fang Zhe held his silence.

Four soldiers descended next, taking defensive positions around Guan Yu, weapons at the ready.

After a long moment, Guan Yu exhaled heavily. His diagnostic scan showed Zhao Jing’er stabilized, needing no immediate treatment. Lifting her unconscious form, he rose.

“Guan Yu, is Jing’er alright?” Fang Zhe finally asked. He’d held back earlier, having witnessed Guan Yu’s miraculous healing before.

Turning with a tired smile, Guan Yu replied, “Uncle Fang, she’s just shaken. No serious harm. We should leave—she needs rest.”

He omitted his fear of Lin Dong lurking nearby.

Fang Zhe nodded. “The helicopter’s here.”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Her condition can’t handle a helicopter ride. We need a vehicle.”

“My oversight,” Fang Zhe conceded. “This was the advance team. Support vehicles are coming—we’ll drive when they arrive.”

Guan Yu tightened his hold on Zhao Jing’er, saying nothing.

Their location—midway between N City and Jingdu—complicated rescue efforts. Before reinforcements arrived, the original Volkswagen escort caught up, parking roadside.

Two young men emerged, guilt-ridden glances at Guan Yu and his burden. Saluting Fang Zhe, they reported stiffly, “Captain, we failed. Two targets escaped.”

Fang Zhe frowned. These men’s skills were exemplary—their opponents must’ve been extraordinary. The attackers’ focus on Guan Yu became clear. Why target Zhao Jing’er? None would dare provoke her grandfather’s wrath, and her hospital-bound life invited no enemies.

Meeting Fang Zhe’s questioning look, Guan Yu said, “I’ll explain en route. Let’s find shelter for Jing’er first—she’s still feverish.”

Urgency sharpening his movements, Fang Zhe personally drove them away in the Volkswagen.

Resting Zhao Jing’er’s head on his lap, Guan Yu stroked her hair and confessed, “You’re right, Uncle Fang. This was a planned hit on me. I dragged Jing’er into it.” He recounted events verbatim.

Gazing at her pale face, regret gnawed at him.

“Did you see the surviving attacker?” Fang Zhe asked sternly. “The Mercedes corpses are being investigated. We’ll have answers in Jingdu.”

Guan Yu marveled at Fang Zhe’s efficiency. “His name’s Lin Dong. Unbelievably skilled—nearly killed me.” He detailed Lin Dong’s preternatural escape timing.

“Lin Dong…” Fang Zhe repeated, brow furrowed. The name rang faint bells—someone with such instincts couldn’t be ordinary.

While driving, Fang Zhe phoned for a background check on Lin Dong, to be combined with the dead men’s data.

Three hours later, Jingdu’s skyline emerged.

Guan Yu gaped at the metropolis’ daytime splendor—crowded streets, endless traffic. His second visit, yet the first proper look. Last time, Old Zhao had whisked him here at night. Now, its grandeur dwarfed N City.

Directionally challenged, Guan Yu only noticed their arrival when the Volkswagen halted before two statue-still soldiers guarding a gate. Fang Zhe’s credentials gained them entry.

The compound resembled an elite residential area—low buildings scattered amidst serene yet imposing grounds. Patrols of armed squads heightened the secure atmosphere.

*What is this place?* Guan Yu wondered, awestruck.

Ten minutes later, Fang Zhe parked before a modest villa. “We’re here. The Old Marshal awaits.”

Guan Yu’s throat tightened.

**Chapter 410: Dragon’s Wrath**

His nerves were justified. Anyone’s first visit here would unnerve them. If Marshal Zhao blamed him for Jing’er’s injury, he’d have to accept it.

Carrying Zhao Jing’er inside, Guan Yu found the villa sparsely furnished—wooden furniture, tea sets, bookshelves. Eerily lifeless.

“Does the Marshal live alone here? No servants?”

Fang Zhe nodded. “I manage his daily needs. Only he resides here.”

Entering the parlor, they found a white-haired man pacing—Marshal Zhao Zilong, hands clasped behind his back, worry etched on his face.

Saluting, Fang Zhe announced, “Mission accomplished. No casualties.”

The Marshal’s initial smile at seeing Guan Yu vanished when he noticed Zhao Jing’er’s pallor. “What happened? Is she—”

“She’s fine,” Guan Yu interjected. “Just frightened. I failed to protect her as promised. My deepest apologies.”

Relief softened the Marshal’s features. “Set her down in her room first.”

As Guan Yu carried her away, the weight of Jingdu’s shadows pressed heavier. This journey’s true trials had only just begun.
