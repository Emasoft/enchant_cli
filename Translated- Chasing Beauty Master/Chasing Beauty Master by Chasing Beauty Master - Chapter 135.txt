Guan Yu smiled tenderly and embraced Feng Xin once more.

“You greedy thing, your mind wanders at the sight of beauty. That girl’s no good—too bewitching…” Feng Xin muttered under her breath.

Thus, Feng Xin was appeased. Though her resentment toward Wen Qing remained fierce, the likelihood of another explosive confrontation had diminished for now.

“Don’t visit that girl tonight,” Feng Xin warned, clinging to Guan Yu’s arm as he prepared to leave.

**Chapter 330: And There’s Another**

Hah… even this needed managing? Guan Yu chuckled and nodded. “I won’t. I’ll come see you tonight.”

“You wish! If you dare show up, I’ll… I’ll…” Blushing furiously, Feng Xin glared at him, threats dissolving into incoherence.

Amused, Guan Yu watched her fluster. With a stomp of her foot, she snapped, “Get lost! Stop annoying me! Go!” She shoved him out unceremoniously.

Leaving Feng Xin’s quarters, Guan Yu headed straight to Wen Qing’s room.

Wen Qing, stunned by his visit, flushed with gratitude. She approached him meekly, eyes brimming. “Darling… they all hate me!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “This act makes things difficult. I agreed to let you stay, but can’t you at least pretend to be genuine?”

Wen Qing’s tender expression froze, as if doused in ice water.

“What do you mean?” she demanded, brows knitting. “You think this is an act?”

Guan Yu’s silent smirk confirmed her suspicion.

Tears welled in her eyes. “I’ve laid my heart bare for you! Never have I pursued any man like this… and you doubt me?” She wiped her cheeks angrily.

Another crying woman. Guan Yu scratched his head helplessly—he couldn’t bear tears. He’d just placated Du Xiaojuan, though her gloom lingered. Now Wen Qing wept. Had he misjudged her?

*Slap!* He smacked his forehead. *Idiot! Use your powers—Inspection Technique!*

Activating the skill, he locked eyes with her.

*Ding!*
*Target consciousness: clear. Mental state: calm. Accuracy: 75%.*

A flood of insights struck him. His gaze softened, doubts dissolving. Wen Qing’s feelings were genuine—her longing had grown steadily since that night. Her boldness had unnerved him, but her heart was true.

“Don’t cry… it hurts me,” he murmured, reaching to wipe her tears. She turned away.

“I’m shameless, aren’t I? Knowing you have others, still I followed you here—only to be suspected. Loving you was my greatest mistake!”

Her vehemence startled him. As she grabbed her luggage, panic gripped him. The thought of her in another’s arms twisted his heart.

Blocking her exit, he pleaded, “I’m sorry. I was wrong.”

“You believe me now?” she choked.

“Yes. My fault.” Guilt weighed his voice as he studied her exquisite face.

Wen Qing collapsed into his arms, sobbing. A sharp pain suddenly pierced his shoulder—she bit down hard, holding for ten agonizing seconds.

“My mark,” she sniffed, releasing him. “Never doubt me again.”

“I promise,” he rasped, rubbing the wound.

With Wen Qing pacified, Guan Yu sighed. Managing multiple women was exhausting. Then it struck him—*Liu Shilei remains!*

**Chapter 331: Just Wanted to See You**

Having calmed three women, Guan Yu finally slept. Tomorrow would bring another challenge: explaining things to Liu Shilei.

No woman would tolerate her man’s philandering. Despite her claims of indifference, Liu Shilei’s jealousy ran deep. The thought of her made him smile—stubborn yet fragile. Hurting her was unthinkable.

Du Xiaojuan woke crying that night, clinging to him desperately. By dawn, she’d quieted, leaving Guan Yu to ponder his chaotic situation—romantic entanglements, Luo Cheng’s faction, his stalled ambitions.

Quick wealth through gemstone gambling paled against long-term enterprise. Current funds were insufficient, his influence in N City still superficial.

*Complacency breeds ruin,* he resolved. Progress demanded urgency.

Next morning, the tense trio accompanied him to campus. Du Xiaojuan remained sullen but compliant. Wen Qing embraced him pointedly before leaving, provoking eye-rolls.

In class, Tian Hao and Wang Zhen relayed Liu Shilei’s summons.

Her office buzzed with chatting teachers. Liu Shilei didn’t look up as Guan Yu entered.

“The school secured you a film internship. Report today.” She slid a contact card across the desk. “Take two student assistants.”

“Professor Liu, I—”

“Dismissed.” Her tone iced over.

Undeterred, Guan Yu leaned closer. “I just want to look at you.”

Colleagues choked on their tea. Flustered, Liu Shilei scribbled a note: *Stop this! We’ll talk later.*

**Chapter 332: Rascal, Don’t Say It**

Outside, Guan Yu pulled her into an alcove. “Let’s talk properly.”

“Are you insane?” She kicked his shin, cheeks crimson.

In her empty dorm, she crossed arms. “Explain.”

“You’re jealous.”

Her glare wavered. The standoff broke when Guan Yu’s persistence wore her resolve. Their silent battle ended with her conceding a private meeting—the first thaw in her frosty demeanor.
