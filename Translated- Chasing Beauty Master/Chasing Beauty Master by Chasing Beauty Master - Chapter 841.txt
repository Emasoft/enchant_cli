Chapter 2153: Another Move and We Won’t Hold Back

Beneath the wooden crate lay two figures with black sacks over their heads—one stout, the other lean. Hou Jinshun concluded these must be Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo.

Beside the commercial vehicle stood a rickety wooden table and several long benches occupied by three Feng Family underlings.

Three outside, three inside—six men in total. Calculating their numbers, Hou Jinshun declared, “We’ll pose as Young Master Feng’s men and march straight in.”

With six opponents, Hou felt confident of victory if conflict arose.

Leading his men back to the warehouse entrance, Hou swaggered through the creaking iron gate. The three Feng guards outside immediately tensed.

“Who goes there?” One shone a flashlight at them while others drew blades from their coats. “Halt! Take another step and we won’t hold back! Identify yourselves!”

Fear tinged their voices—Hou’s group outnumbered them.

Halting, Hou announced, “We’re Ma He’s men, sent by Young Master Feng to retrieve the hostages.”

A shrewd guard whispered to a companion, “Call the Young Master to verify.” Turning to Hou, he demanded, “Proof you serve Ma He?”

“No need for calls,” Hou interjected, producing a pistol. “The Young Master lent this as proof. Recognize it? Ma He has defeated Guan Yu. The matter’s settled—these hostages are now useless.”

As Hou advanced to hand over the weapon, he suddenly withdrew it. “Too dark out here. Let’s inspect it inside.”

The guards recognized the firearm—they’d polished it daily. Yet one skeptic blocked them: “Only you enter. Your men wait here.”

“Clever bastard,” Hou cursed inwardly. Smile vanishing, he snapped, “Still doubt us? With this gun, we could’ve slaughtered you already. You’d leave my men shivering in this damp cold?”

Convinced by this logic, the guards relented: “All enter—but surrender the pistol first.”

Hou handed it over. “Inspect quickly—we must return it.”

Inside the warehouse, Wei and Jia remained hooded. As six guards clustered around examining the weapon, one exclaimed, “It’s genuine! I chipped the grip while cleaning!”

While others nodded, the skeptic insisted, “I’ll confirm with the Young Master.”

Panicking as the guard dialed, Hou signaled his men. A needle-like rapier materialized in his hand—half-meter long, thin as a knitting needle.

Before the call connected, cold steel flashed. The skeptic’s gun-hand tumbled away, wrist severed clean. Blood geysered two seconds later.

“AAAAAH!” The scream echoed through the woods. Hooded hostages cowered as Hou’s men subdued the remaining guards.

“Get him to hospital,” Hou warned a less-injured guard. The men scrambled into their vehicle and fled.

Unhooding the captives, Hou met Wei’s terrified scream: “Don’t kill me! I’ll pay anything!”

Recognizing Hou moments later, Wei cried, “Brother Hou! You’re rescuing us?”

“On Guan Yu’s orders,” Hou nodded. As they supported the numb-legged captives outside, Guan Yu himself arrived with Jones.

“They escaped,” Guan Yu sighed at the battle’s aftermath. At the hospital, examinations revealed minor injuries—Wei’s shock, Jia’s superficial back wound.

When pressed for details, Wei fabricated: “Thugs insulted our gang! We fought but got overwhelmed...”

Guan Yu saw through the lie. Under threat of future abandonment, Jia confessed: “A stranger promised... entertainment... better than cafeteria girls. We were drugged in the car.”

“BRAIN-DEAD MORONS!” Guan Yu roared. “You think free pleasures rain from heaven? One more slip-up and I won’t save you!”

The chastised pair sat rigid. “UNDERSTOOD!”

Guan Yu warned solemnly: “The Fengs strike from shadows. Stay vigilant—their next move might be fatal.”
