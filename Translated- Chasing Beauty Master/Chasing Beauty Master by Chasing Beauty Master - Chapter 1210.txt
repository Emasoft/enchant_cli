“Moreover, there are gaps between each stone step,” Guan Yu remarked with trembling awe as they ascended. “Grandpa Lu, why on earth did you people build this bridge so perilously? Isn’t it terrifying to traverse? Look at these cracks! One misstep and you’d plunge to your doom!”

“Hehehe, impossible,” chuckled Grandpa Lu, observing Guan Yu with amused fondness as one might regard a skittish pet. “Those gaps are barely a finger’s width. Do you truly think you could fall through?”

“Even if I can’t fall, it’s still unnerving! I know this bridge might’ve been here since your sect’s founding, but that’s no excuse. At least you could renovate it—lay crimson carpets over these gaps to mask them. Wouldn’t that make the crossing less dreadful?” Guan Yu grumbled.

Grandpa Lu’s laughter echoed. “That would require miles of carpet! Truth is, we of Mount Yunqing fear no such heights. You’re the first to voice this concern in centuries, young exception!”

Resolving never to tread this accursed path again—regardless of whether he mastered their mystical arts—Guan Yu decided future visits to Tiger’s Head Peak would be Grandpa Lu’s burden. The half-hour crossing felt interminable, each step amplifying his vertigo until solid ground finally welcomed his soles.

Before them stretched a vast plaza, fifty paces wide and over two hundred long, culminating in towering vermilion gates. “The Tiger’s Head Hall,” Grandpa Lu announced. “The Sect Leader awaits within.”

As they approached, Guan Yu’s gaze drifted to a shimmering lake flanking the cliffside. “How does water pool so high in these peaks? Where does it flow from?”

Grandpa Lu shrugged. “Another mystery I’ve never pondered. Perhaps mountain springs feed it. The waters have remained thus since time immemorial.”

“You’ve dwelled here decades yet know nothing of your own domain?” Guan Yu sighed theatrically.

“Curiosity never plagued me as it does you,” the elder replied. “I seldom visit unless summoned. Decades may pass between my ascents.”

Guan Yu bit back retorts about immortal timescales. Before them loomed colossal gates twenty meters high—absurd grandeur that made him mutter, “Did ancients expect giants to visit? Such waste!”

Beyond lay a staircase leading to a palatial hall dwarfing imperial courts. As they entered, Guan Yu gaped at the vaulted ceilings and minimalist grandeur: flawless patterned carpets, bronze braziers, and at the dais’ summit, a throne outshining dragon seats.

There sat Sect Leader Xuanming, his grey mane coiled beneath a jade hairpin, draped in flowing azure robes that whispered of celestial winds.

“Elder Brother Sect Leader,” Grandpa Lu bowed. “This is Guan Yu, the prodigy I mentioned.”

Mimicking the salute, Guan Yu improvised: “Greetings, Great Immortal!”

A rumbling chuckle answered. “Great Immortal? Since you address Lu as grandfather, call me Elder Xuanming. We needn’t stand on formality.”

“Then, Elder Xuanming,” Guan Yu pressed, “Might I learn Yunqing’s arts? Grandpa Lu brought me hoping—”

The Sect Leader’s piercing gaze swept over him. “Lu claimed you’re a Realm Master despite appearances. Show me your meridians.”

As Xuanming’s spiritual probe entered Guan Yu’s body, it recoiled from the maelstrom devouring his dantian. “Remarkable!” the elder exclaimed. “This vortex seal... I’ve seen its like before—on a girl child years past.”

“Zhang Han!” Guan Yu blurted. “Her mother, a demonic royal, cast that seal while dying!”

Xuanming’s eyes narrowed. “Demonic magic? Then only their bloodline can break this. Yet...” He turned to Grandpa Lu. “Perhaps Elder Jiu could—”

“Elder Jiu?” Grandpa Lu paled. “But he’s secluded since the Great War!”

Xuanming nodded gravely. “Our founder’s last surviving companion dwells in reclusive meditation. He... resents disturbances.”

Undeterred, Guan Yu pressed, “What of learning your arts? Must I join as disciple?”

The Sect Leader stroked his beard. “Our rules demand novices study precepts for a year before touching esoterica. Yet for a sealed Realm Master...” His voice trailed into weighty silence, the hall’s shadows deepening with unspoken implications.
