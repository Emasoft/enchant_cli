“Yu Kong, do you now admit your guilt?” The emperor pointed angrily at the prostrate figure below. Yu Kong, the aged eunuch who had grown and aged alongside His Majesty, had served the throne his entire life. Though the emperor held genuine affection for this lifelong companion, that very trust had become the foundation of Yu Kong’s unchecked power. As Chief Eunuch, his authority extended far beyond the elite guards to every corner of the inner palace, rendering him second only to the emperor himself.

In recent years, the emperor had sought opportunities to curb this overgrown influence, yet Yu Kong’s flawless conduct and legion of defenders made it impossible—until now. The scandal involving the elite guards had spread through the martial world, stripping Yu Kong of all plausible denials. Seizing this chance, the emperor resolved to finally discipline his once-trusted servant.

“Your Majesty, this old servant is wronged!” Yu Kong wailed, forehead pressed to the floor. “The assassination attempt on Lord Zou was orchestrated by Sun Jian without my knowledge! He must have acted under someone else’s orders—I only learned of it afterward!”

The emperor’s jaw tightened. With Sun Jian dead—whether from his wounds or Yu Kong’s silencing hand—the eunuch had deftly shifted blame to a corpse. “Sun Jian was your subordinate!” the emperor thundered. “How could you remain ignorant of fifty men being mobilized? What manner of supervisor are you?”

“Your Majesty speaks true,” Yu Kong groveled. “This was my negligence. Henceforth, I shall strictly discipline all under my command to prevent such lapses.”

“Your men have made the entire realm mock my rule!” The emperor’s voice rose. “Even children’s rhymes scorn my governance! Shall I be remembered as history’s fool?”

“All surviving conspirators shall be publicly executed,” Yu Kong vowed. “Not one will escape justice. I swear to quell this turmoil swiftly.”

“As their commander, your crimes merit death!” The emperor paused, then moderated his tone. “Yet ignorance may spare your life—though not your punishment.”

“This humble servant accepts Your Majesty’s judgment.” Yu Kong hid a smirk. The palace couldn’t function without him, and both knew it.

“Confiscate one year’s stipend,” decreed the emperor. “You are stripped of your position as Supervisor of the Inner Palace.”

This demotion severed Yu Kong’s unrestricted access to the harem—and his clandestine dealings with Lady Guifen. The message was clear: the emperor knew.

“I thank Your Majesty’s mercy.” Yu Kong kowtowed. “All matters shall be resolved posthaste.”

As the eunuch withdrew, the emperor sighed. Trust had become a phantom in this nest of schemers.

Meanwhile, Lord Zou’s party reached Mingwen City. The day’s ambush—their most perilous yet—had been thwarted by Guan Yu’s prowess. Now, in a spacious inn chamber, the prince dined with his protectors.

“Eat well, Lao Cang,” Lord Zou nodded to Guan Yu. “Today’s victory owes much to your valor.”

“Our duty, my lord.” Guan Yu inclined his head. Across the table, Zou Wuxiao nursed a deep arm wound, his combat prowess diminished.

When the city governor arrived unannounced, Lord Zou received him with thinly veiled chill. “To what do I owe this late visit?”

“Merely to offer hospitality!” The governor simpered, beady eyes darting. “Had I known of your arrival—”

“Spare the courtesies.” Lord Zou cut him short. “Does Mingwen harbor mercenaries for hire?”

“Alas, such riffraff are banned within city walls.” The governor’s ingratiating smile never wavered. “They skulk in hills and hovels.”

As the prince dismissed him, the governor retreated, his oily demeanor leaving unease in his wake. The road ahead promised greater dangers—ones no false friend would shield them from.
