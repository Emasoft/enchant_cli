Yet the Demon Lord never anticipated that Wang Xiaorong and Guan Yu had already consummated their relationship. Given this development, killing Guan Yu became utterly impossible. Moreover, this bond might even be leveraged to recruit Guan Yu into the Demon Soul Sect. The Demon Lord's immediate desire was to confront Guan Yu, pose critical questions, and observe his responses.

These machinations remained unknown to Xuanming. The Demon Lord had already devised a contingency: should Guan Yu prove ungrateful or resistant to persuasion, he would expose their affair to the entire Cloud Azure Sect. Once scandalized, Guan Yu's position within the sect would become untenable.

Xuanming would undoubtedly lead the charge against him, with others swiftly following. However, this scheme would irreparably tarnish Wang Xiaorong's virtue.

Chapter 3607: The Grand Study

Master Jiu maintained stringent protocols for this domain. Xiao Dong, feigning alarm, warned Guan Yu against unauthorized entry, lest Master Jiu's wrath bring severe punishment.

Guan Yu nodded understandingly. He already knew this restricted area housed not only Master Jiu's lifetime collection of texts but numerous precious artifacts. Unregulated access would have reduced it to chaos long ago.

Perhaps the study concealed Master Jiu's secrets—a reasonable justification for its protection. Yet Guan Yu's curiosity burned fiercely; denied entry, sleep would surely elude him tonight.

Though Xiao Dong's vigilant presence barred conventional entry, alternative methods might prove feasible. Guan Yu retreated, unwilling to force his way. Despite Xiao Dong's youth and muteness, Guan Yu sensed formidable power in the attendant—likely surpassing his own combat skills in direct confrontation.

Nurtured under Master Jiu's tutelage in the Cloud Azure Sect's secluded mountains, Xiao Dong's cultivation had flourished through relentless discipline. His current prowess neared master-level status.

Returning to his quarters, Guan Yu observed Xiao Dong still diligently working through his window. Earlier offers to assist in cleaning the study had been firmly rejected, underscoring its sanctity.

Contemplating nocturnal infiltration, Guan Yu dismissed the idea—without illumination, exploration proved futile, and lighting lamps risked exposure.

Resolving to petition Master Jiu directly, Guan Yu approached the main hall. The elder sat motionless before ancestral tablets, prayer beads rotating through wrinkled fingers, eyes closed in meditation.

"Master Jiu," Guan Yu whispered, drawing near, "are you asleep?"

The elder's eyelids lifted slowly. "I heard your hurried footsteps from afar. What urgent matter brings you panting here?"

"Merely wishing to converse," Guan Yu smiled innocently.

"Speak plainly, little fox," Master Jiu replied tersely, clearly resuming interrupted devotions.

Undeterred by the rebuke, Guan Yu produced the Imperial Seal artifact. "This fascinates me—what master craftsman forged such a wonder? Its sentient spirit and responsiveness seem miraculous."

Master Jiu countered, "Why sudden interest in artifacts? Your cultivation remains too immature for such mysteries."

"Though I grasp not its depths, might I understand its principles? What materials forge such treasures?"

"Artifact crafting demands profound spiritual energy, rare materials, celestial alignment, earthly resonance, human harmony—and fortune's favor," Master Jiu intoned. "Superior artifacts require exceptional components, though true masters can transform mundane objects through serendipity."

Guan Yu persisted, "If materials matter less than craftsmanship, could I attempt creation? Surely practice yields experience."

"Folly!" Master Jiu scoffed. "Failed attempts drain vital energy and shatter resolve. Most artifacts emerge through happenstance, not design."

Undeterred, Guan Yu pressed until Master Jiu relented, handing him a wooden block. "Channel your qi through this. Let reality temper your enthusiasm."

Hours later, yelps echoed as flames engulfed the wood, blistering Guan Yu's palm. "Why combustion?!" he cried, nursing injuries.

"Failed infusion," Master Jiu observed wryly. "Now you comprehend my warnings."

Chapter 3608: Fortunes Smiling

"One failure proves nothing!" Guan Yu protested. "Had I used metal—"

"Material matters not," interrupted the elder. "Even paper becomes artifact in skilled hands. Consider A'Ze's calligraphy brush—crafted from parchment, yet potent."

Guan Yu's skepticism softened. "Then the Furnace of Heavenly Blaze...?"

"Forged from common bronze through Deity Meng's fortuitous touch. True mastery lies in seizing destiny's moments."

Chapter 3609: Denied

"Then might I study artifact tomes?" Guan Yu ventured. "Knowledge accelerates cultivation."

Master Jiu's eyes narrowed. "Your true aim surfaces. The study remains forbidden."

"But—"

"Enough! This conversation concludes." The elder's beads resumed their rhythmic click, signaling immutable refusal.
