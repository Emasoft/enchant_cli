“Impossible.” Chu Fan said, “Though I haven’t been in the capital long, I’ve heard of how the Cao family seized the Li family’s assets back then. They accused the Li clan of treason, exterminated their entire lineage down to the ninth degree. How could any survivors remain to seek revenge? The Caos wiped them out root and branch to eliminate future threats.”

“Truly ruthless methods,” Guan Yu remarked coolly. “The Cao family’s evils will be repaid in time. Today’s events are merely the beginning.”

Chu Fan shook his head helplessly. “Empty words. Opposing such a powerful clan isn’t done through talk alone. Besides, such talk shouldn’t be uttered carelessly outdoors. Eavesdroppers could bring unnecessary trouble.”

Guan Yu cared little. In the capital, none feared the Cao family less than he—a man without property or attachments. Destroying the Caos would be ideal, but if unsuccessful, he could simply vanish without consequence.

Not so for Chu Fan. To thrive here without challenging the Cao family’s dominance, he dared not provoke them. A misstep could dissolve the Hongyan Opera House entirely, leaving his own fate uncertain.

Thus, confronting the Caos now was impossible. Chu Fan prioritized the opera house and Jiang Xin’s safety, resolved to develop quietly while avoiding clashes. This divergence in their perspectives stemmed from their circumstances—a reality Guan Yu understood.

Guan Yu asked, “Have you seen Lady Jiang these past days? Surely matters at the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence are settled by now.”

“Unclear. I’ve been recuperating, only leaving daily for medical treatment.” Chu Fan replied flatly. “I haven’t seen Jiang Xin.”

His foot injury—diagnosed as severe bone fissures—required prolonged rest and crutches. Logically, Jiang Yuan should’ve resolved the East Sea Dragon Pearl affair by now. Jiang Xin would’ve rushed to Chu Fan’s side upon hearing of his injury. Her absence puzzled Guan Yu, who resolved to visit Jiang Yuan.

“Focus on healing. That matters most.” Guan Yu produced a stack of banknotes. “Ten thousand taels. Take this.”

Though fond of wealth, Chu Fan showed no joy. “The silver you left earlier sufficed. Why more?”

“I’ve arranged for master craftsmen to arrive soon,” Guan Yu explained. “They’ll demolish and rebuild this place. Move the troupe to a nearby inn—all expenses covered. Take this for lodging. Request more if needed.”

“Rebuilding the entire opera house?” Chu Fan frowned. “Wouldn’t that take years?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Not so. Your recovery needs three months minimum—others longer. These funds should sustain you through convalescence. As this disaster stemmed from my conflict with the Caos, I bear responsibility.”

Noting Chu Fan’s concern, he added, “With ample funds and skilled workers, construction will finish in two to four months. By reopening, your injuries will heal, and Hongyan Opera House will rebirth itself in splendor.”

The timeline felt distant even to Guan Yu, uncertain how long the Eight-Sided Drum Technique’s emergence might keep him here. Yet he vowed to continue funding the reconstruction regardless.

The deputy manager interjected, “Master Chu, Lord Wan’s plan is sound. We can’t perform in this state. Let us rebuild properly.”

“But the costs...” Chu Fan hesitated.

“Manageable,” Guan Yu assured. “Less than purchasing this estate. I’ll cover everything in exchange for twenty percent of future profits.”

Though reluctant, Chu Fan accepted—without Guan Yu’s aid, the troupe would’ve disbanded. Taking the silver, he broached his deeper worry: “Why help us so? What’s your relationship with Jiang Xin?”

Guan Yu sighed. “I feared this. Jiang Xin and I are mere friends. I’m neither her betrothed nor Jiang Yuan’s chosen son-in-law. We’ve known each other days. Pursue her freely—I’ve my own fiancée.”

Chu Fan nodded slowly. “Even were you rivals, I’d yield. You’re superior in every way. If she chose you, I’d offer blessings.”

“That day won’t come,” Guan Yu vowed, moved by Chu Fan’s sincerity. “We’re brothers. Trust this.”

Their pact sealed, Guan Yu invited the troupe to feast at the luxurious Wanyang Restaurant. Only three longtime members remained—loyalists since the opera house’s founding. All declined, self-conscious about their status, leaving Chu Fan and Guan Yu to dine alone.

As Guan Yu sought transportation for Chu Fan’s crutch-bound journey, a familiar carriage approached—Jiang Xin’s ostentatious European-style coach, trailed by guards.

“Look who emerges!” Guan Yu grinned. “The young mistress finally freed.”

Jiang Xin burst out before the carriage halted: “Chu Fan! Are you hurt? Let me fetch our physician!”

“Merely a sprain,” he soothed. “You’ve grown thinner.”

“Confined for days!” she complained, glaring at Guan Yu. “Your cursed East Sea Dragon Pearl caused this! I only learned of the attack yesterday.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Ten days late, yet you fret?”

She huffed. “I’d have come sooner if not for Father’s restrictions. What happened here? They said many were injured—”
