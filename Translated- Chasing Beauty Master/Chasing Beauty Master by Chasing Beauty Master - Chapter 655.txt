This time, Liu Shilei couldn't accompany Guan Yu to the Sun family. Riding in Sun Xiaoya's car, Guan Yu informed her he needed to take several days off in three days for matters in the capital. Sun Xiaoya replied coldly, "If you want leave, just tell Principal Liu directly. Once she approves, who dares refuse you?"

Guan Yu watched Sun Xiaoya's pretense of focused driving, her eyes deliberately avoiding him, finding the situation amusing. Though her initial attitude towards him had been purely teacher-student, he sensed new undercurrents now – perhaps subtle jealousy arising since she discovered his relationship with Liu Shilei.

Upon their arrival, Mother Sun was overjoyed see Guan Yu, urging Xiaoya to prepare extra dishes while chattering: "Xiaoya, your husband works hard all day to earn money. A woman should serve her man well for a happy home. A woman's success isn't in career achievements but family happiness. Look at me – my husband left me. What happiness remains?"

Mother Sun's words sparked Guan Yu's curiosity. During his time here, neither Xiaoya nor her mother ever mentioned the father. Had he passed away or divorced Mother Sun?

Feigning casualness while helping in kitchen, Guan Yu inquired about Xiaoya's father. She turned sharply, teeth clenched: "Hmph! All men are scum! My father was like that, you're the same – both heartless abandoners!"

Raising hands in mock surrender, Guan Yu protested: "Teacher, you can't judge all men by your father! And when have I ever 'abandoned' anyone?"

Waving her kitchen knife, Xiaoya retorted: "Sleeping in the same bed isn't 'improper' enough for you?" Having changed into home clothes after work – a thin blouse she normally wore privately with her mother – her movements caused the neckline to slip, revealing ample cleavage as she gestured angrily.

Guan Yu's gaze involuntarily dipped before he cautioned: "Careful with that knife, sister." Before he finished, Xiaoya slipped on kitchen puddles, the blade swinging toward his head as she fell.

Time seemed suspended. Instead of tragedy, Xiaoya found herself suspended mid-fall, strong arms catching her against a firm chest. The knife clattered as she realized Guan Yu had miraculously moved behind her.

"Are you hurt?" Guan Yu murmured. Blushing furiously, Xiaoya squirmed: "I'm fine! Let go! Where are your hands?!" His palms cupped her soft curves, her wriggling intensifying sensations until blood rushed to his nose and lower body.

Their thin summer clothes left nothing hidden. Xiaoya froze as she felt his arousal, masculine scent clouding her senses. Years of celibacy for her mother's sake earned her the "Ice Queen" title, but that fateful shared bed had planted forbidden seeds. Now embraced, those suppressed desires resurfaced.

As Xiaoya's trembling subsided, she tentatively returned the embrace, face buried crimson in his chest. Guan Yu lifted her chin, meeting parted lips in an electric kiss that left them both breathless.

"Shameless! Even your teacher dares molest?" Xiaoya gasped when they separated. Their moment shattered by Mother Sun's sudden applause at the doorway: "That's right! Newlyweds should be affectionate! How else get grandchildren?"

Banished from the kitchen, Guan Yu later treated Mother Sun's dementia. Channeling spiritual energy, he discovered his own image in her mental pathways – puzzling evidence of past connection. Could this elderly woman be some forgotten paramour? The horrifying thought struck – what if Xiaoya was his secret daughter? Yet timelines didn't match.

That night, facing Xiaoya's bedroom door left suggestively ajar, Guan Yu hesitated. Inside, she lay pensive, finally confronting him: "What's between you and Liu Shilei?"

Guan Yu smiled ruefully: "Not what you think. I'm no kept man. Truth is... she was my teacher too, long ago."

Xiaoya scoffed – how could Guan Yu, seemingly under twenty, have studied under Liu Shilei? Yet moonlight revealed an ageless quality about him. The mystery deepened when Guan Yu asked about her father's name.

"Wait!" Xiaoya suddenly realized. "Mother's dementia... she kept talking about legendary heroes from twenty years ago! The Dragon Group's Guan Yu who vanished exploring the Demon Tower! You share his name and... face?"

Guan Yu's heart skipped. Those old propaganda posters... could Mother Sun have imprinted that heroic image, explaining her instant acceptance? Yet how to explain appearing unchanged after two decades?

As Xiaoya traced his features wonderingly, Guan Yu's mind raced. The truth hung between them – a temporal paradox where past and present lovers' stories dangerously intertwined.
