“Alright, I don’t want to hear your flattery. Since we’re all in agreement, let’s each attend to our tasks!”

Under Guan Yu’s mediation, the dispute was perfectly resolved. After the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu approached the innkeeper and asked, “Proprietor, do you know where Mayor Bade’s residence is?”

The innkeeper frowned curiously. “Young Master Guan Yu, didn’t you just call Mayor Bade a fool earlier?”

“Correct, he is indeed a fool. But right now, there’s a matter only he can handle.”

“Oh? What matter are you referring to?”

“No need for you to know. Just tell me his address. I’ll handle the rest!”

“Very well.” The innkeeper refrained from further questions. Pointing northeast, he said, “Follow this street straight ahead for about ten kilometers. You’ll find a large estate—that’s Mayor Bade’s mansion.”

“Good. I’ve left Amy and Liu Chuntian at your inn. Keep an eye on them and ensure they don’t wander off. Can you manage that?”

The innkeeper nodded. “Young Master Guan Yu has toiled so much for Barren Town. Though I’m of little help, this small task I can handle!”

“My thanks!” Guan Yu glanced at Bika Cat and Liu Yishou behind him. “Let’s go!”

“Ah? Must I come too?” Liu Yishou blinked in surprise.

“Normally not, but as an outsider, I lack credibility here. Apologies for the trouble—rest assured, there’ll be no fighting this time.”

“Er…alright then!” Liu Yishou rose shakily. Advanced in years and exhausted from the day’s ordeal, his bones ached as if about to crumble. Were it not for his granddaughter Liu Chuntian, he doubted he’d have survived this long.

Guan Yu shook his head inwardly. Barren Town was truly dilapidated. Of its thousand inhabitants, barely a few dozen practiced magic—mostly the elderly, weak, or infirm. Even the Wolfmen’s weakest forces could easily slaughter them all. Were it not for his intervention, this place would soon become a ghost town!

Following the innkeeper’s directions, the group arrived twenty minutes later at a vast clearing. A solitary mansion stood amidst hundreds of meters of grassland. Comparing it to the shabby buildings in the residential area they’d passed, Guan Yu sneered—this mayor clearly prioritized luxury over his people.

Approaching the wrought-iron gates, Guan Yu frowned. “Why are the gates shut? Is the mayor never home?”

“I wouldn’t know. As a commoner, I’ve had little contact with him beyond major assemblies. But I’ve heard Mayor Bade dislikes staying idle—often strolls nearby when free.”

“Then why today’s exception?”

“Boss, don’t forget he was attacked by Wolfthorn Flower this morning. Though not life-threatening, his injuries require recuperation.”

“Then he must still be inside. Bika Cat, scout ahead. Report immediately if anything’s amiss.”

“Understood!” Bika Cat leaped onto the gate, vaulted into the compound, and vanished from sight within seconds.

Guan Yu and Liu Yishou waited outside. Minutes later, Bika Cat reappeared, grinning. “Seems we underestimated Bade!”

“What? Isn’t he there?”

“Oh, he’s inside alright.”

“Good. Let’s enter.”

“Ahem…Boss, Bade’s indeed present—with two others.”

“Who?”

“His wives, I presume. They were…occupied when I arrived.”

“Pfft!” Guan Yu nearly spat blood. Despite his injuries, Bade remained energetic enough for a threesome!

“Did you inform him of my visit?”

“I did. But they were…busy. We should allow them preparation time.”

Guan Yu nodded—any man would understand.

Another ten minutes passed. Impatient, Guan Yu ordered, “Bika Cat, hurry him up!”

As Bika Cat hesitated, a flustered figure rushed from the mansion—Mayor Bade himself.

“What do you want?” Bade’s eyes flickered with unease, clearly still traumatized from the morning’s events.

Guan Yu smirked. “Recovered well, I see. Those wounds don’t hinder your…duties.”

Bade flushed. “State your business!”

“We’re here about the Wolf Girl.”

“Nonsense! There’s no Wolf Girl here! Leave at once, or I’ll call guards!”

“So this is Barren Town’s hospitality? How enlightening.”

“I’ll summon guards if you linger!” Bade pressed a red button on the gate. Alarms blared as dozens of masked swordsmen emerged from the bushes—his private guard.

“Impressive display. Where were they this morning against the Wolf Girl?” Guan Yu taunted. “Ah yes—you said we could leave out of gratitude for saving your life. Seems your life’s value is…modest.”

“Enough! Leave now!”

Bika Cat sprang onto the gate, snarling, “You trembled like a leaf this morning! Now you strut with hired muscle? These lackeys won’t last three minutes!”

“Braggart! Test them if you dare!”

Seeing diplomacy futile, Guan Yu shrugged. “Bika Cat. Playtime—no fatalities.”

The divine beast’s eyes gleamed. With a roar, azure energy blasted from its maw, flattening the guards instantly.

Bade gaped at his fallen men. “Get up! Fight!”

Guan Yu coldly observed. “Rejoice they’re merely groaning, not corpses.”

Trembling, Bade stammered, “Wh-what do you want?”

Bika Cat jeered, “Where’s your bravado now?”

Guan Yu interjected, “Enough. Mayor Bade, we require your assistance regarding the Wolfmen.”

“Assistance? You’re powerful enough!”

“Not for fighting. Your skills are…lacking. We need you to help save Barren Town.”

Bade paled. “More Wolfmen?”

“The one today was weak. Your entire town couldn’t withstand their main force.”

“Then…we’re doomed?”

“Unless,” Guan Yu leaned closer, “you cooperate fully.”
