“Alright… I don’t blame you. You’ll meet a girl you like sooner or later. Even if not now, in a few years, you’ll have to face love and marriage eventually.” Liu Shilei glanced faintly at Guan Yu, rolling her eyes.

What… did she mean? Guan Yu froze again, blinking rapidly, utterly lost for words.

After a long silence, his face red and neck bulging, he stammered, “Sister Shilei… you… you won’t marry me?”

**Chapter 181: I Believe You**

Liu Shilei turned to stare at him for a full ten seconds before sighing. “You’re still young… the gap between us is too wide. Let’s keep things as they are. I’ve said it before—when you find someone you love and no longer want to stay with me, we’ll just…”

“What are you saying?” Guan Yu frowned, displeased.

“Let me finish!” Liu Shilei waved her hand calmly. “When you meet a woman you truly love, you’ll understand why I’m saying this. I… don’t want you to struggle later.” Her forced smile carried a tinge of sorrow, sharp enough to pierce the heart.

“Don’t look at me like that. Maybe one day I’ll find a good man and leave you first. Who knows about tomorrow, right?”

“No!” Guan Yu stopped abruptly, glaring with possessive intensity. “You’re mine! Don’t even think about other men!”

Liu Shilei bit her lip. “Then what? Marry me? I’m years older. Would your family agree? What would others think?” Her gaze met his steadily.

“Who cares about them?” Guan Yu retorted defiantly, chin lifted.

“Stop being childish. I’m just speaking hypothetically.” She shook her head with a faint smile.

“Even hypothetically! You’re mine alone—no one else!” He grabbed her soft hand, clasping it fiercely.

“Fine, I’m all yours. Happy now?” She chuckled affectionately, pinching his pouting cheek.

Guan Yu’s expression softened. “No matter what happens, I won’t leave you! And… you can’t like other men either.”

The words sounded laughably naive, but his urgency lent them weight.

“Okay, I promise. Little rascal.” Liu Shilei cupped his face, her fingers tracing his brows with tender warmth.

How could she bear to part from him? Since childhood, she’d never known the sweetness of a boy’s kiss or embrace—until him, her student, a decade younger. Now, with Guan Yu dropping out to live with Du Xiaojuan, her heart ached silently. Though their intimacy had begun accidentally—a drugged mishap—she couldn’t blame him.

Her “advice” masked her true feelings. Watching his flustered, boyish possessiveness, her heart softened.

Around them, cars and passersby blurred. In that moment, only each other existed.

“I’ll make you happy. Always,” Guan Yu vowed solemnly.

“Mhm.” Liu Shilei smiled, radiant.

As they wandered, Du Xiaojuan’s name hung unspoken between them.

“Stay away from school awhile. Let her family’s anger cool. I’ll mark your absence as a leave—months or a semester won’t matter.”

From Liu Shilei’s account, Du Xiaojuan’s family vilified Guan Yu as the scheming seducer who’d lured their daughter away.

“Gaining their acceptance will take time. Calmly persuade her to reconcile with them.”

“But Sister Shilei, there’s really nothing between us!” Guan Yu insisted earnestly.

“I believe you. Still, plan ahead—no foresight invites trouble.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Empty words! Her “belief” clearly doubted him. Yet why did she still cling to his arm, unbothered?

Baffled, he struggled to decipher her thoughts.

“To win her family’s approval, you need achievements. Arranged marriages are outdated, but as a penniless boy, how can they trust you?”

“Trust me with what? There’s nothing!” He stamped his foot.

“I know… I trust you.” Her nod contradicted her tone.

*This is trust?* Guan Yu gaped, speechless.

“Take it step by step. I’ve arranged temporary work—my classmate’s film crew is shooting here. Treat it as an internship.”

So she’d planned his job too! Yet—did he need wages to support Du Xiaojuan?

**PS:** New Year’s arrived amidst sluggish updates. Hectic days aside, two chapters emerge late. Wishing everyone joy and prosperity!

**Chapter 182: I Don’t Know How to Make Money**

Guan Yu nearly refused, nearly revealed his true circumstances. But seeing her earnest efforts, he stayed silent.

Her logic was undeniable: without status, Du Xiaojuan’s family would scorn him. A business empire might change that.

Did he love Du Xiaojuan? Unclear. Yet instinctively, he felt she belonged to him—that naive girl he yearned to protect. The possessiveness tormented him.

Noticing his silence, Liu Shilei squeezed his arm. “Don’t worry. Our… *incident* was accidental. I won’t cling to you. When you find your true love, I’ll disappear quietly.”

“Don’t say that!” Guan Yu met her gaze fiercely. “I never dreamed someone as beautiful and gentle as you could be mine. The past doesn’t matter—I want you. I’ll make you happy, always.”

Her heart quivered. Clutching his arm, she nodded heavily.

They strolled under willows, hands linked—peaceful, natural. *Grow old together*… the thought lingered.

After hours wandering, he escorted her back to campus, Du Xiaojuan unmentioned.

Returning to the hotel, he found Du Xiaojuan and Niu Le laughing at TV skits.

“Where’d you go? You said you’d be back soon!” She bounded over, tugging his sleeve.

Guan Yu evaded, mind churning. His excuses felt hollow even to himself. Why else would he rescue her?

The road ahead loomed rocky. As Liu Shilei said, his penniless state doomed him in her family’s eyes.

“Enough TV. Let’s discuss earning money.” Guan Yu turned off the screen.

“Gamble again! Next time, win millions from strangers!” Niu Le grinned.

Useless. Guan Yu eyed Du Xiaojuan. “Any ideas? Fast money?”

“I don’t know how to make money,” she mumbled.

He sighed. “What’s your family’s business?”

“Jade. Necklaces, pendants… stuff like that.”

Jade! Inspiration struck. Excelling in her family’s field might win approval.

**Chapter 183: Jade Gambling**

“Contact your family someday. They’ll worry, hate me forever otherwise.”

“You’re… sending me back?” Du Xiaojuan palmed, clutching his shirt in panic.

Guan Yu flicked her forehead. “After escaping? Let them catch me?”

“Then why ask?”

“Plan ahead. Your family’s hunting us. My school’s buzzing with their rage.”

She faltered. “They’ll… calm down.”

“They’re searching everywhere. We can’t hide forever.”

The dilemma tightened. Liu Shilei’s self-sacrificing words haunted him—how could he abandon her? Yet Du Xiaojuan’s wide-eyed devotion anchored him equally.

“We need money. Serious money.”

“How?”

“Your family deals in jade. Let’s try jade gambling.”

“Huh?”

“Raw stone gambling. Fortune from jadeite.” Determination glinted in his eyes.
