Chapter 3944: Full of Schemes

"If we truly end up injuring Xiang Shouzuo (First Seat Xiang), that fellow might feign illness again for some time—something Guan Yu certainly didn’t want. Moreover, Xiao Zhi couldn’t wait any longer. Thus, Guan Yu had Xuan Ming seek out Xiang Shouzuo first, presenting him with a piece of ironstone to keep him pleased."

Guan Yu continued, “If First Seat Xiang can better assist Xiao Zhi in dispelling the Blood Poison, I might have even more ironstone remaining after crafting the hand crossbow.”

Xuan Ming understood Guan Yu’s implication. If Guan Yu refused to cooperate, no one could persuade him. Over time, Xuan Ming had come to know Guan Yu’s temperament—forceful methods would never work, as he heeded no one’s counsel.

Xuan Ming said, “Guan Yu, I’ll naturally help you approach First Seat Xiang. But you know what kind of man he is. While I can speak to him, I can’t guarantee his willingness.”

“If he refuses,” Guan Yu said coldly, “I hope you won’t interfere with what I do next. Such a faithless individual hardly deserves to remain Yunqing Sect’s First Seat.”

“Do you remember what I told you when you first arrived?” Xuan Ming replied. “I know you yield to softness, not force. Even if First Seat Xiang loses face, he’s still a sect elder. When you joined us, I gifted you many magical tools—not for you to turn them against your own comrades.”

This was Xuan Ming’s warning: Guan Yu must not resort to harsh measures against sect members. Losing Xiang Shouzuo’s cooperation would be disastrous. If the First Seat agreed willingly, matters would proceed far more smoothly.

After a moment’s thought, Xuan Ming added, “Guan Yu, what if I take this ironstone you’ve given me and present it to Xiang Shouzuo? For years, he’s lacked a suitable magical tool. This might intrigue him enough to agree.”

Given the circumstances, Guan Yu had little choice but to concede for Xiao Zhi’s sake. Xiang Shouzuo was a scoundrel—injuring him would only give him excuses to feign illness and withhold treatment.

Relenting, Guan Yu said, “Very well. If Xiang Shouzuo agrees, I’ll gift you another ironstone once Xiao Zhi recovers—as thanks.”

“Splendid! This matter is settled. I’ll send word later.” Xuan Ming resumed his seat. “You may return now. Await my news.”

When Guan Yu returned to the back mountain, Wang Jun asked, “What happened? Did Xuan Ming demand more ironstone? Was he dissatisfied with the small piece?”

“Of course not. He was overjoyed,” Guan Yu replied. “But his main purpose was to send me to the desert to find Miao Cheng.”

“Again? It seems Xuan Ming is determined to obtain the Eight-Drum Technique,” Wang Jun remarked.

Guan Yu chuckled wryly. “Indeed. Who am I but a pawn? When the master commands, I obey.” Privately, he didn’t mind—he already possessed the first volume of the Eight-Drum Technique. Securing the second would be advantageous.

Guan Yu mused that mastering the complete technique might one day help break the seal in his mind. His anticipation grew. With his skills, success was assured unless the Demon Lord intervened personally.

Wang Jun changed topics. “Have you heard of the Demon Soul Sect’s recent exploits?”

“What happened?”

“During Red Lotus Sect Leader Sun Lianzi’s birthday celebrations—a thinly veiled gift-grabbing affair—the Demon Sect sent two agents to steal their treasured Universal Compass.”

“Universal Compass?” Guan Yu frowned. “Isn’t the Red Lotus Sect’s treasure the Jade Octagram? What use does the Demon Lord have for this compass?”

“Major sects hoard multiple treasures. Yunqing has the Hidden Dragon Sword, but the Merit Cauldron is equally formidable. The Universal Compass must hold significance. A Red Lotus elder was injured during the theft.”

“By whom?”

“The Three-Headed Medicinal Immortal,” Wang Jun revealed. “The same one who saved you in the bamboo grove. Surprised he didn’t rescue Xiao Qi himself earlier?”

Guan Yu pondered this inconsistency but dismissed it. “The Demon Soul Sect’s affairs don’t concern us. Xuan Ming wants me to find Miao Cheng in the desert. How did you respond?”

“I’ll go. He says crafting crossbows can wait—we must prevent the Demon Lord from obtaining the Eight-Drum Technique. Many Yunqing disciples have already been wounded or killed there.”

Wang Jun scoffed, slumping into a chair. “Yunqing postures without substance. Their elders and leaders laze about, scheming while junior disciples risk their lives. Sending novices to deadly missions—what folly!”

“It’s strategy,” Guan Yu countered. “Projecting weakness lulls enemies into complacency. When true conflict arises, seasoned members will emerge.”

“At what cost? The desert teems with Demon Sect experts. Sending you alone—do they want you dead?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “I welcome the challenge. Consider it an adventure. I’ve long wondered about Miao Cheng’s mysteries.”

Chapter 3945: A Clever Plan

“How exactly did you negotiate with Xuan Ming?” Wang Jun pressed.

“I demanded Xiang Shouzuo cure Xiao Zhi’s Blood Poison before I depart. I’ll take both Xiao Zhi and you, leaving Wang Zhanglao (Elder Wang) in charge here. Without me, he’d bungle the crossbows anyway.”

“You think Xiang Shouzuo will agree?”

“That depends on Xuan Ming’s persuasion. Until Xiao Zhi is healed, I won’t budge.”

Guan Yu focused on finalizing Wang Xiaorong’s crossbow. The solid mercury arrowheads posed challenges—their toxic nature required careful handling.

Seeking Elder Wang’s expertise, Guan Yu presented the metal. “Can this be forged into arrows?”

Elder Wang hefted the dense material. “Solid mercury? Brilliant! Its weight and toxicity make perfect projectiles.”

“But how to shape it without poisoning ourselves?”

“High-temperature molds,” Elder Wang explained. “Clay molds withstand the heat. Once melted and cast, we’ll polish them.”

Guan Yu marveled at the simplicity. “How many arrows can we make?”

After calculations, Elder Wang concluded, “Fifty or more. Deliver the specifications—I’ll have them ready in two days.”

Gratified, Guan Yu returned to his workshop. Within three days, the crossbow would be complete. He envisioned Wang Xiaorong’s delight upon receiving it.

Unbeknownst to him, Wang Xiaorong had learned of his desert mission. She confronted the Demon Lord, pleading, “Father, let me join Guan Yu!”

“Absolutely not!” the Demon Lord thundered. “The desert devours even seasoned experts. Guan Yu’s protection means nothing against its whims!”

Chapter 3946: Firm Refusal

Wang Xiaorong tried bargaining. “Guan Yu crafted a special crossbow for me. Don’t you want to examine its power?”

The Demon Lord wavered momentarily—such a weapon could shift balances. Yet paternal concern prevailed. “Even for that treasure, I won’t risk your life. Old Sun perished there, and he knew the sands intimately.”

“But our forces are already in the desert!”

“No! You’ll meet Guan Yu elsewhere if needed. Never in that graveyard!”

Defeated, Wang Xiaorong stormed out, plotting alternative schemes. Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s preparations continued—unaware of the storms ahead, both literal and political.
