Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo had finally taken Guan Yu’s words to heart, fully grasping the gravity of the situation. They were determined not to become his weakness or a liability.

After offering a few more words of reassurance to the two, Guan Yu, Jones, and Hou Jinshun left. The trio headed to the Midnight Blossom Club for a late-night meal.

Meanwhile, Young Master Feng still lay unconscious in the woods. Fortunately, the Feng family’s subordinates had managed to rush his severed limb to the hospital in time. Had they been any later, his arm would have been rendered useless.

The Feng family’s men informed the patriarch of Young Master Feng’s disappearance, sending him into a rage. He mobilized every member of the household to search for his son.

Upon hearing the news, Feng Xihu (West Lake) sought out her father. “Father, what’s happened?” she asked. Seeing his beloved daughter, the patriarch’s anger subsided slightly. “Your elder brother is missing,” he replied.

“But he always travels with so many guards. How could he vanish?” Feng Xihu grew anxious. Such a thing had never happened to the Feng family before.

The patriarch slumped onto a sofa and sighed. “I warned him not to provoke Guan Yu openly, but he wouldn’t listen. That Guan Yu is no ordinary man. Let’s pray he wasn’t the one who took your brother, or we’ll face dire consequences.”

At the mention of Guan Yu, Feng Xihu’s eyes sharpened. She knew her brother had gone to confront him and was vaguely aware of the family’s covert plans against Guan Yu.

“No, Guan Yu wouldn’t abduct him,” she stated firmly. Though she hadn’t interacted much with Guan Yu, she understood his character well enough. Capturing Young Master Feng would serve no purpose and only invite trouble.

As for killing him outright—Guan Yu wouldn’t dare commit such an act openly.

“Why are you so certain?” the patriarch asked.

“Because capturing that useless brother of mine would be pointless,” Feng Xihu retorted before retreating to her room.

The Feng family deployed over a hundred people, even their kitchen staff, to scour the woods. Yet Young Master Feng remained elusive.

A portly chef, panting heavily, cursed inwardly: *Fuck, I’m just a chef, not some Feng family dog. Making me search for a missing brat? This is exhausting!*

Accustomed to a life of leisure within the Feng estate, the chefs resented being dragged into this mess.

**Chapter 2156: A Severe Illness**

The same portly chef, gasping for breath, muttered curses under his breath. *Damn the Feng patriarch!*

Exhausted and irritated, he spotted a poplar tree and moved to sit. But as he lowered himself, he let out a shriek: “Mother of god!” A body lay beneath the tree. Terrified, he bolted.

His flabby frame jiggling as he ran, he screamed, “Dead body! Dead body!” A kitchen worker unaccustomed to such horrors, he fled blindly into the deepening woods until he stumbled upon two Feng family guards.

“Wait for me!” he wheezed, trembling. “I saw a corpse back there!”

The guards laughed at his drenched pants. Enraged, the chef snapped, “Laugh all you want! Go see for yourselves if you’re so brave!”

“A corpse? Could it be Young Master?” one guard wondered. Realizing the possibility, the trio retraced the chef’s panicked path. By dawn, they found the unconscious Young Master Feng under a tree.

When he awoke, he startled. “What the hell? Where am I?” It took him a minute to recall the previous night’s events. Surrounded by subordinates, he regained his bravado. “Useless fools! It took you all night to find me in this tiny woods? *Achoo!*”

A sneeze interrupted his tirade. His body ached, and his skull throbbed from Hou Jinshun’s blow.

Returned to the Feng estate, the sleepless patriarch finally relaxed upon seeing his pale son. The young master had contracted a high fever from lying exposed all night. His illness lingered for days, deepening his hatred for Guan Yu, who remained unharmed while Ma He had vanished.

**Chapter 2157: The Celestial Corps**

After recovering, Young Master Feng brooded in his favorite room, smashing a trinket. “Damn it, I’ll tear you into a thousand pieces!” he vowed, silencing the trembling woman beside him.

The memory of that night in the woods haunted him. He shuddered to think what wild beasts might have done. His fury then turned to Hou Jinshun, manager of the Midnight Blossom Club—a杨家 (Yang family) establishment. “I’ll target that manager. The Yangs won’t interfere over a mere employee.”

He ordered investigations into Hou Jinshun, planning to strike at Guan Yu through him.

Meanwhile, the Feng family had secretly contacted the renowned international assassin group, the Celestial Corps. Guan Yu had clashed with them before losing his memory.

The Celestial Corps boasted numerous experts, including over ten First-Class Venerables. They’d once assassinated a national leader guarded by elite forces, cementing their reputation.

To negotiate, Young Master Feng traveled abroad. Despite language barriers, the author mandates all characters speak Chinese, so communication posed no issue.

In a lavish European-style hotel suite, Feng awaited the Celestial Corps’ liaison. Securing this meeting had cost the Feng family considerable resources, reflecting their determination to eliminate Guan Yu.

A tall, curvaceous Western woman entered—her dark skin contrasting with golden curls, clad in a tank top and shorts. Though her exotic beauty didn’t appeal to Feng’s taste, her seductive aura intrigued him.

“Hello,” Feng greeted, standing to shake hands. He realized she towered half a head above his 170 cm frame.

“Hello, I’m Gumbili,” she replied in accented Chinese.

After exchanging pleasantries, Feng stated his purpose: “I wish to hire your strongest experts to kill someone.”

Gumbili feigned shock. “The mightiest? They’re untouchable deities. Let’s discuss your target’s cultivation level instead.”

Feng revealed Guan Yu was a Second-Class Venerable.

“For a Second-Class, we recommend one First-Class or two Second-Class Venerables,” Gumbili said, rubbing her fingers暗示 (hinting at payment).

Suppressing irritation, Feng ordered a subordinate to present stacks of USD.

Gumbili’s smile widened. “Two First-Class Venerables would ensure success. The fee is 200 million upfront, plus another 200 million upon completion.”

Feng balked. “I heard it was 100 million per First-Class!”

“Demand has increased,” Gumbili shrugged.

After haggling and bribing her further, Feng secured the original rate: 100 million per First-Class. Total cost: 400 million.

**Chapter 2158: 250 Million**

Gumbili, satisfied with her bulging purse, conceded. “Given your… generosity, we’ll honor the old rate. Two First-Class Venerables for 200 million upfront, 200 million after.”

Though staggering, Feng agreed. The Feng family would scrape together the funds. Guan Yu’s head was worth any price.
