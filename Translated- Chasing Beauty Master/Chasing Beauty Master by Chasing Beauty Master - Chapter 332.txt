“Ah, what a fortunate yet unfortunate man!” Wen Qing sighed deeply.

Guan Yu looked at Wen Qing with confusion, not understanding her words.

Wen Qing smiled faintly and said, “You’re fortunate enough to have six women at home already. Though you flirt around, they never get angry and still dote on you – seems you’ve been thoroughly spoiled! Yet you’re unfortunate because the woman who makes your heart itch still isn’t yours! I wonder – in those mountain woods with such perfect opportunities, why didn’t you claim Gao Wei?”

Guan Yu stood dumbfounded.

Wen Qing’s reasoning was too brutally perceptive.

Her words cut straight to the bone.

Guan Yu swallowed hard, wounded and exasperated. “I’m a righteous man! Don’t spout nonsense!”

“Righteous? A righteous man who wants daily threesomes? I bet you’ve imagined getting all six women into one bed!” Wen Qing rolled her eyes.

Cough! Cough!

Guan Yu covered his mouth, disguising his guilt with righteous indignation. “Nonsense! I’ve always treated Jing’er as a sister – never had improper thoughts!”

“She’s not your blood sister. Just a ‘god-sister’!” Wen Qing emphasized the word with a suggestive tone, completely altering its meaning.

Guan Yu was stunned.

His women truly were extraordinary.

“Enough. The star’s solo is ending. Prepare for your couple’s performance!” Wen Qing glanced at the stage where Gao Wei’s song neared its conclusion.

“Tsk, first being my co-host husband, now performing as a couple with her. If I were a man, I’d envy you to death!”

Guan Yu nearly collapsed from exasperation.

Gao Wei’s voice was true celestial music, elegant yet deeply moving. As the final note faded...

Thunderous applause erupted!

“Weiwei, I love you!”

“Weiwei, another song!”

...

Gao Wei smiled and waved farewell, turning to leave.

“Seems our audience wants more. Gao Wei, leaving now would ruin the fun!” Guan Yu emerged backstage with perfect timing.

Gao Wei froze, her gaze complex as she looked at Guan Yu.

“Come, let’s spend more time on our alma mater’s stage.” Guan Yu naturally draped his arm around Gao Wei’s shoulders, guiding her forward.

The audience erupted again!

“Let’s have Gao Wei choose an audience member to duet with! What say you?” Guan Yu shouted.

Wen Qing was both gentle and formidable. Though she seldom showed her strong side around Guan Yu, this didn’t mean she tolerated challenges to her boundaries.

Wang Dachui’s provocation earned him icy disdain.

“Let’s see how this plays out!” Wang Dachui sneered, plotting revenge.

“For a century, our university has nurtured outstanding talents – including an Asian superstar. You know who I mean, right?” Wen Qing’s voice soared.

“Gao Wei! Gao Wei!”

The crowd roared like caged beasts finally freed.

As the atmosphere peaked, Wen Qing announced: “Yes, Gao Wei! Let’s welcome our superstar!”

The curtains parted to reveal Gao Wei in moon-white evening gown, her presence eclipsing the lavish stage.

“Hello everyone. I’m Gao Wei, honored to return to my alma mater.” Her celestial voice sparked thunderous cheers.

Backstage, Guan宇 watched the radiant figure, sighing deeply.

“Husband, entranced by our star’s aura?” Wen Qing teased.

“Just appreciating art.” Guan宇 shrugged.

“Hmm? Body’s pure, but your heart’s itching?” Wen Qing pressed.

Guan宇 scratched his head sheepishly.

“Ah, what a fortunate yet unfortunate man!” Wen Qing sighed.

When Gao Wei’s performance concluded, Guan宇 seized the moment: “Leaving now would disappoint your fans!”

Gao Wei paused, tension radiating from her frame.

“Let’s share more time with our母校.” Guan宇 guided her forward, his arm around her shoulders.

The crowd erupted again!

“Let’s have Gao Wei choose someone to duet with! Who should it be?”

Gao Wei gazed at Guan宇, her voice clear as spring water: “I want to sing with Guan宇.”

The crowd exploded.

“Forget Love” resonated through the stadium, Gao Wei’s voice intertwining with Guan宇’s. Though unfamiliar with the lyrics, Guan宇 followed her lead, their voices merging in bittersweet harmony.

As the final notes faded, thunderous applause shook the foundations. Gao Wei’s smile held secret melancholy, visible only to those who knew to look.
