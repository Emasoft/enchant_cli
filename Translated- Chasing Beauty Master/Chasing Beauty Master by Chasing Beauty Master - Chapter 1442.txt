“Young Hero Yan (Salt Marsh), there’s no need for formalities. The Yunqing Sect is the foremost righteous faction in the martial world. As their chief disciple, your status is illustrious—many envy the disciples of Yunqing for their role in vanquishing evil and upholding justice. As for me, I share deep ties with your Chief Xiang. Just ten years ago, we fought side by side.” Manor Lord Lu began by emphasizing his connection to the Yunqing Sect, as if forging camaraderie.

**Chapter 3753: Each Has Their Needs**

Manor Lord Lu chuckled warmly. “Now that you’ve come to my humble estate, please dispense with formalities. Treat this as your home and act freely.”

“We thank you for your hospitality, Manor Lord Lu,” Yan Zhao replied. “Though our journey here was fraught with challenges, we now have a request to make of you.”

“Speak freely! I shall spare no effort to assist,” Manor Lord Lu declared with unhesitating generosity, as though no request could daunt him.

Initially, the manor lord had hoped to detain the trio for a few days and enlist their help in resolving a pressing matter. To his delight, they broached the subject first. *If I aid them, they’ll surely reciprocate,* he mused.

Yan Zhao continued, “Our mission requires crossing the desert. We’ll need camels to traverse the vast distances. Without them, the journey would be perilous. Might you provide three camels for our use?”

“Hah! Such a trifling matter hardly warrants a ‘request’! Even had you not asked, I’d have gifted them upon your departure. All camels here are bred on my estate—not the finest, but certainly reliable.” Manor Lord Lu waved a hand dismissively.

Xiao Zhi sipped his tea and interjected, “Manor Lord Lu, I am Xiao Zhi. Chief Zheng of the Yunqing Sect is my father.”

“Ah! So you’re Chief Zheng’s son! How you’ve grown—time flies!” The manor lord’s tone oozed familiarity, as though he’d known Xiao Zhi since childhood. His duplicitous charm was palpable.

Xiao Zhi pressed, “Manor Lord, you seem weary. Dark circles shadow your eyes—has some trouble weighed on you?”

Yan Zhao now noticed the manor lord’s haggard appearance, as if sleepless for days.

Manor Lord Lu sighed. “Two days past, I received word of an impending attack from the Demon Soul Sect. They gather forces to strike Tiger’s Maw Manor. Though I fear nothing for myself, our ordinary villagers… If battle erupts, the innocent will suffer. The Demon Soul Sect’s cruelty leaves me sleepless. This is no simple predicament.”

“The Demon Soul Sect?” Yan Zhao frowned. “What grudge could they hold against you?”

“The Demon Lord once invited me to his stronghold, likely to exploit my knowledge of locating Mirage City. I refused. Moreover, Tiger’s Maw Manor guards a treasure he covets—the Mystical Fire Stone, our guardian relic. He sought to ‘borrow’ it, but I’d never surrender our heritage. This assault is mere pretext.”

The manor lord spoke urgently, as though willing Guan Yu and the others to grasp the gravity.

“Hardly surprising,” Guan Yu remarked. “The Demon Lord’s greed is legendary. With your knowledge of Mirage City and possession of the Mystical Fire Stone, his aggression was inevitable.”

Yan Zhao declared grandly, “Manor Lord, we cannot stand idle in your hour of need. Command us as you will!”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “As righteous disciples, we must oppose the demonic sects. We’ll lend our strength!”

“Indeed, combating evil is our sacred duty as Yunqing disciples.”

Manor Lord Lu smiled in satisfaction. With three Yunqing elites aiding his defense, the odds improved. “But your mission… I wouldn’t delay you.”

Guan Yu studied the manor lord, uncertain if this crisis was genuine. Yet Tiger’s Maw Manor’s peril seemed no feint.

The manor lord had orchestrated this meeting precisely to secure Yunqing’s aid. Once the Demon Soul Sect was repelled, the trio could resume their journey.

“Our mission isn’t urgent,” Xiao Zhi countered. “If we help repel this attack, will you guide us to Mirage City afterward?”

“If I survive the battle, I’ll lead you myself,” Manor Lord Lu vowed.

Yan Zhao added, “Your manor teems with martial talent. Would the Demon Soul Sect dare assault such strength?”

The manor lord straightened proudly. “Every soul here trains in combat. What began as a hamlet of dozens now houses thousands. Though we lack the Demon Soul Sect’s ancient foundations, Tiger’s Maw stands united. Yet war benefits none—only the people’s ruin.”

**Chapter 3754: A Lend of Strength**

Manor Lord Lu struck a noble pose. “War rends families and tramples the helpless. Even victors pay dearly. This I cannot abide.”

Guan Yu found these the manor lord’s first sincere words. True—war’s true victims were always the common folk.

“Manor Lord Lu, your wisdom humbles us,” Yan Zhao fawned.

The manor lord basked in the flattery, adopting a pained expression. “Though I’ve tried diplomacy, the Demon Lord’s ambition brooks no restraint. We’ll evacuate our vulnerable and fortify defenses. Our martial artists are skilled, but against the Demon Soul Sect’s legions… We must prepare thoroughly.”

Guan Yu noted the rare humility. Tiger’s Maw might rival minor sects, but the Demon Soul Sect’s cultivated warriors dwarfed their might.

Exchanging glances, Yan Zhao and Xiao Zhi turned to Guan Yu. He shrugged—their mission could wait. Witnessing this clash might prove instructive.

Manor Lord Lu’s hospitality wasn’t altruistic. His design to enlist them was transparent, yet Yunqing’s principles demanded intervention.

“Manor Lord,” Yan Zhao proclaimed, “we three shall stand with Tiger’s Maw. Righteousness compels us!”

Overjoyed, the manor lord clasped his hands. “With Yunqing’s heroes here, victory is assured! Our terrain favors defense—the western slope forces attackers uphill. Guard three flanks, and the battle is ours!”

Guan Yu recalled the mountainous approach. Tiger’s Maw’s elevation and walls posed challenges, but the Demon Soul Sect might resort to cunning over brute force. Spies likely already infiltrated.

**Chapter 3755: Hindrances**

“The Demon Soul Sect masses westward,” Manor Lord Lu warned. “Their assault looms within days.”

Yan Zhao nodded. “Your walls tower five meters—no easy breach. We’ll hold firm.”

“Your aid is invaluable. When this ends, I’ll personally thank Yunqing.”

“We but fulfill our duty,” Yan Zhao intoned. “Evil must be eradicated.”

After further pleasantries, servants led the trio to lavish guest chambers. Guan Yu’s room boasted silken bedding and opulent furnishings. He collapsed onto the bed, pondering the Demon Soul Sect’s motives. *Why a full-scale assault? If the Mystical Fire Stone is the prize, why not stealth?*

Unless… Manor Lord Lu himself was the target. His knowledge of Mirage City—accessible only to demons—hinted at darker truths. Guan Yu’s thoughts churned. The upcoming clash might unveil more than battle cries.
