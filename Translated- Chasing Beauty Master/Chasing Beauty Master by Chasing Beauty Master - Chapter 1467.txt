Guan Yu turned to Elder Lu with a faint smile and said, "Thank you for your concern, Elder Lu. But rest assured—while I may not be your match in combat, dealing with such trash is well within my capabilities."

Seeing Guan Yu's confident demeanor, Elder Lu relaxed. He knew Guan Yu never acted recklessly. If the young man spoke with such assurance, there must be no cause for worry. Beyond Elder Lu's trust, Elder Xuanming also believed in Guan Yu.

Elder Xuanming had remained silent all this time, neither intervening nor stopping the impending duel. He wanted to observe both the fight and Guan Yu's improvements firsthand—to understand why the young man dared act so arrogantly upon his return.

If Guan Yu lost, it would temper his arrogance. If he won, it would showcase his prowess before the disciples and reveal his newfound strengths. Either outcome held value.

Elder Zheng shook his head helplessly. While he held no dislike for Guan Yu, the boy's tendency to show off troubled him. Perhaps only through bitter failure would the youth learn prudence. This was precisely why Elder Zheng had previously discouraged Xiao Zhi from associating too closely with Guan Yu. The young man's roots in Cloud Azure Sect remained shallow and unstable.

If Xiao Zhi and Guan Yu together offended too many people, it would hinder their future prospects. Elder Zheng believed today's lesson might prove necessary—even if Elder Xiang appeared incompetent, he still outmatched Guan Yu.

Most disciples also doubted Guan Yu. Though Elder Xiang's reputation among them was poor, his strength remained undeniable. Guan Yu's bravado seemed exaggerated, especially after voluntarily setting aside the Imperial Seal. Wouldn't this invite humiliation? How could preserving face matter after being battered by Elder Xiang?

Elder Dai watched with amusement, not believing Guan Yu would win yet certain the clever youth had tricks prepared. As a former Peak Sovereign expert, even if defeated, Guan Yu wouldn't suffer complete disgrace. There might be unexpected moves yet.

**Chapter 3824: Teaching You a Lesson**

Elder Dai clearly remembered Guan Yu's cunning from their time at Convergence Peak. The shrewd youth never acted without purpose. By relinquishing the Imperial Seal now, he must be laying a trap for Elder Xiang.

Most disciples cheered for Elder Xiang, especially those from Hollow Peak, shouting excitedly that their master would finally redeem past humiliations today.

Guan Yu smiled. "Elder Xiang, shall we make a wager?"

"Enough chatter! Attack first, lest others accuse me of bullying youth." Elder Xiang spat, lips twisted.

"No hurry. A simple fight lacks flavor." Guan Yu's smile widened. "Let stakes make it interesting. Otherwise, I've no interest in sparring with you."

"Fear grips you, whelp?" Elder Xiang planted hands on hips, laughing uproariously. "Kneel and apologize before all disciples, and I'll spare you today!"

Elder Dai frowned. This didn't align with Guan Yu's character. The youth wouldn't surrender without fighting—this must be part of his scheme.

Elder Zheng sighed inwardly. The boy's earlier arrogance now gave way to retreat, inviting mockery. What pointless stubbornness.

Elder Xiang's supporters grew more vocal, Hollow Peak disciples nearly dancing as they cheered. Elder Xuanming watched disapprovingly—a senior elder bullying a junior while disciples mindlessly cheered reflected poorly on Hollow Peak's discipline. Today's exposed traitor already indicated needed reforms.

"Whether I fear matters not," Guan Yu countered, bending to retrieve the Imperial Seal. "If you dare not wager, I'll take my leave."

"Wait!" Elder Xiang barked. Guan Yu paused, hiding his satisfaction.

"Boy, you cling to false pride rather than apologize. Very well—name your wager."

Guan Yu pretended to ponder. "The Imperial Seal. Agreeable?"

"Truly?" Elder Xiang's eyes gleamed as he stole a glance at Elder Xuanming. The legendary artifact every cultivator coveted could elevate its wielder exponentially. Even a novice like Guan Yu had used it to accidentally defeat him before—such was its power. As a divine artifact, its might scaled with the user's strength.

Elder Xiang's heart raced. Obtaining it today would be effortless fortune. Once his, not even the Sect Leader could reclaim it.

Elder Lu watched anxiously. Gambling the Imperial Seal? Reckless!

"Excellent!" Elder Xiang nearly salivated. "After teaching you respect, the Seal shall be mine. Begin!"

Guan Yu replaced the Seal on the ground. "Patience. Should I lose, it's yours. But if you lose, what equivalent treasure will you stake? Fairness demands equal value. Isn't that right, everyone?"

The crowd roared agreement. Elder Xiang flushed—as Hollow Peak's impoverished leader, he owned no comparable artifacts. His iron ruler, crafted from rare materials a century prior by Elder Cao, paled against the Imperial Seal's divine status.

Guan Yu sneered. "That rusty ruler can't match my Seal. Name something worthy."

"What else would you have?" Elder Xiang growled. "I possess nothing better."

Guan Yu feigned disappointment. "Then stake fifty years of spiritual cultivation. If you lose, transfer fifty years' worth to Xiao Zhi. Elder Lu already sacrificed fifty years to stabilize his blood poison. Yours would complete the cure."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Elder Xuanming stood abruptly. "Truth? The Blackmarsh blood poison has no antidote!"

"None," Guan Yu confirmed. "But a century of spiritual energy can purge it—as told by the elder who saved me in the mountains." He fabricated the "elder," concealing Wang Xiaorong's involvement.

Elder Zheng looked gratefully at Elder Lu, marveling at his fifty-year sacrifice. Turning to Guan Yu, he felt profound gratitude—this was true friendship.

Elder Xiang calculated. Though fifty years' cultivation was precious, victory seemed assured. The Imperial Seal's allure overwhelmed caution. "Done! Begin!"

Guan Yu nodded, leaving the Seal. "I'll fight without it—lest you cry unfairness."

Drawing Soulfall Blade, he spun the magnificent weapon. Murmurs of envy arose—another supreme artifact!

**Chapter 3825: Fairness**

"Have at you!" Guan Yu channeled internal energy through the blade, releasing a golden arc of battle qi. The shockwave smashed Elder Xiang's defensive barrier, forcing him back several steps despite hastily dispersing force through spiritual energy. His head throbbed from residual impact.

Gasps erupted. "Battle Qi Blade! Impossible!" someone cried. Indeed—a technique requiring at least Second-Class Sovereign mastery. Though Guan Yu's current strength hovered there, his combat experience far exceeded it.

Elder Zheng gaped. So this was a demonic-martial dual cultivator's power! Even Elder Xuanming stood amazed—such brilliance hadn't been seen in decades.

While others marveled, Guan Yu hid his anxiety. That strike drained his reserves. Against Elder Xiang's spiritual prowess, he stood no chance conventionally. Thus, he produced his Desert Eagle pistol—an alien artifact to all present.

**Chapter 3826: No Killing**

The crowd buzzed at this strange new weapon. Elder Xiang eyed it warily. Guan Yu aimed coldly. "This ends now."

Gunfire cracked. Elder Xiang collapsed, clutching his shoulder. Shock paralyzed the audience. Guan Yu lowered the smoking weapon. "Never underestimate innovation."
