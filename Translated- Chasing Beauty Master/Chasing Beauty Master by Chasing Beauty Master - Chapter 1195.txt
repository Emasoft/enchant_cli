Now only about twenty men remained, while their opponents had completely blocked the road with at least forty or fifty people. Even if these adversaries were incompetent, overwhelming numbers gave them the advantage of two or three against one.

After all, no one wanted to get injured. But when Li Gui shouted and charged forward first, the black-clad followers behind him couldn't just stand by idly—though none fought with true ferocity.

They attacked from the rear, continuously harassing the Lin family's men. Lin Zhonggeng observed his subordinates struggling in combat. The disparity was clear: their opponents were cultivators, while most of his men only knew rudimentary martial skills.

However, Lin Zhonggeng had prepared for this. Raising his hand, he barked, “Archers, ready!”

Li Gui froze upon hearing this. Old Master Li’s expression darkened further—it seemed heaven itself had doomed the Li family.

Once the Lin family’s archers were in position, Lin Qiaoqiao declared imperiously, “Li Gui! Surrender now, or every last one of you will be shot dead here!”

Her tone carried the authority of her former role as police captain in the city. Though not overtly threatening, it radiated undeniable dominance.

Li Gui stopped fighting and turned to look back, despair crushing his spirit. He sought his father’s decision, but the frail old man—already weakened by days without food or drink, exhausted from the journey and recent sprint—sat slumped on the ground, head bowed in silent resignation, clinging to his last shred of will.

The men sent by Zhang San had no intention of dying here. Faced with the archers, they immediately ceased fighting.

The narrow road, flanked by high walls, offered no cover. The leader of the black-clad men approached Li Gui and muttered something.

But Li Gui had no mind to engage. With enemies vastly outnumbering them, escape was impossible.

**Chapter 3067: Don’t Blame Us for Being Merciless**

The black-clad leader shouted across the road, “We’re merely hired help with no quarrel against you! Let us pass, or even if we fight to the death, you’ll gain nothing but wasted lives!”

Lin Zhonggeng considered this. In the brief skirmish, five or six of his men had already been injured without inflicting a single wound. A full battle would mean heavy losses—a foolish choice.

“Very well,” Lin Zhonggeng conceded. “Your men may leave, but not a single Li clansman goes with you.”

The leader nodded and told Li Gui, “Brother, don’t blame us. You see the situation—there’s no chance of victory. We’ve done all we can for you.”

“Let’s go!” The black-clad men dropped their weapons and marched forward.

Lin Zhonggeng ordered his men to open a path. Once the mercenaries departed, he waved his hand, and the Lin family swiftly bound every remaining Li member.

The Li family resisted fiercely, but their fate was sealed. Without delay, the Lin forces escorted them back to the execution ground.

A crowd still lingered, anticipating either the Li family’s escape or the execution of Li Hong that would follow.

The presiding magistrate had been about to order the executions when news arrived of the Li family’s capture. Now, the Lin family delivered them all—including Li Gui—to the center of the square.

The Li clansmen, devoid of hope, stood listlessly. As they were positioned, Guan Yu approached Lin Qiaoqiao and asked, “Where did you run off to earlier?”

“Don’t ask—it’s so embarrassing!” she groaned. “I must’ve eaten something bad. This morning, my stomach rebelled! I was stuck in the bathroom for over an hour. I knew when they came to arrest people, but there were so many… I was too scared to come out!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Lucky escape. If Li Gui had caught you, things would’ve gone badly.”

Had Li Gui seized Lin Qiaoqiao, he’d have taken her hostage alongside the Li women to leverage their escape. Given his obsession with her, he’d have done it without hesitation.

“I can’t watch this,” Lin Qiaoqiao said. “Let’s leave, Guan Yu.”

Nodding, Guan Yu remarked as they walked back, “This matter is settled. I’ll depart tomorrow. Aren’t you returning yet?”

“I’ve a month’s leave! Can’t you stay longer? Missing your women back home?” she pouted.

“I want to avoid your father pressuring us into marriage. With everything resolved, he’ll surely push again. Best I leave early.”

Lin Qiaoqiao longed to marry Guan Yu—each day he stayed increased the possibility. “Even if we wed, it’d be pretend! Why fear that?”

“Of course I fear it!” Guan Yu shook his head vehemently. “Playing your boyfriend to deceive your parents was wrong enough. A fake marriage? Absolutely not!”

If news of such a marriage reached his lovers in Qiaoyuan District, they’d skin him alive. Moreover, he had no intention of marrying—perhaps ever.

Lin Qiaoqiao relented. “Fine. If you’re leaving, I’ll go too. Without you, staying here is pointless.”

“As you wish.” Back at the Lin estate, Guan Yu retired to his room, exhausted. He’d barely closed his eyes when the door burst open.

“Who’s there?!” he barked, bolting upright.

Lin Qiaoqiao bounced in, all traces of her police captain demeanor gone, replaced by a lovestruck girl’s giddiness.

“Get up! My cousin’s here! She heard about her ‘handsome, martial arts-proficient future brother-in-law’ and insists on meeting you!”

Guan Yu, who slept nude in the tropical heat, yanked a sheet over himself. “You barged in without knocking? I’m not dressed!”

He braced for her outrage, but instead, Lin Qiaoqiao blushed crimson, eyes wide. Yet she didn’t flee—her gaze lingered.

“Why aren’t you dressed? You didn’t have to strip completely!” she murmured, voice uncharacteristically soft.

“Aren’t you leaving so I can dress? Your cousin’s waiting.”

Instead, she picked up his clothes and tossed them to him. “Hurry up! So fussy—worse than a woman!” She exited, cheeks burning.

Guan Yu sighed in relief—he’d never been so unnerved by a girl. Dressed, he confronted her outside.

“Why must I parade for every relative? Am I a pet?”

Lin Qiaoqiao giggled. “It’s local custom! Besides, I’ve seen all of you already—why shy about clothed appearances?”

“You’re the one peeping! Admit it—my perfect physique dazzled you.”

“Nonsense!” She reddened further. “I’d never seen a naked man before—just educational!”

“So unimpressed? Maybe I’ll skip meeting your cousin.” He turned away.

“Guan Yu!” she cried. “Must you compete with a girl? How petty!”

“I’m the victim here! Shouldn’t I grieve your ‘insults’?”

“You know I didn’t mean it! Must you provoke me?”

“Then confess—how’s my body?” he teased.

“Stop!” She covered her face. “I didn’t mean to barge in! You’re so… annoying!”

Relenting, Guan Yu chuckled. “Fine, I’ll spare you—this once.”

Beaming, she grabbed his arm. “Come! My cousin’s waiting.”

As they walked, Lin Qiaoqiao’s mind replayed the earlier scene. With anyone else, she’d have erupted in rage—but with Guan Yu, her temper had vanished.

In the main hall, Lin Qiaoqiao’s mother sat with two guests: a woman in her forties and a teenage girl.

“Aunt, this is Guan Yu, my fiancé,” Lin Qiaoqiao announced, clinging to his arm. “Cousin, meet your future brother-in-law!”

The aunt smiled approvingly. Guan Yu noted her well-maintained beauty, barely marred by necklines hinting at her age.

“Hello, Aunt.”

“Such manners!” she praised. “Rare in youths nowadays.”

The girl hopped up, scrutinizing Guan Yu. “Wow! You’re hotter than any Korean oppa! Did you get plastic surgery?”

“Cousin!” Lin Qiaoqiao scolded. “He’s naturally perfect! Unlike those manufactured idols.”

The girl persisted. “No way! His skin’s better than mine! If he’s real, find me one too!”

“Hush!” The aunt chided. “Apologize, Xiaozhu!”

Guan Yu smiled. “No need. She’s charming.”

Xiaozhu preened. “See? Brother-in-law likes me!”

“Enough!” The aunt threatened, “Or I’ll send you home.”

Changing topics, the aunt asked, “When’s the wedding? The martial tournament chose Guan Yu weeks ago.”

Guan Yu interjected, “With Elder Wang’s recent passing, celebrating now would be disrespectful. We’ll decide after her seventh-day memorial.”
