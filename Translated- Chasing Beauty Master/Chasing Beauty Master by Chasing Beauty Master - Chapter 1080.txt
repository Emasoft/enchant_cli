Poison Widow had not expected the man’s tone to be so defiant. With a cold sneer, she declared, “I care not for your affairs, but this day next year shall mark your death anniversary. All you wretched men deserve to die!” As she spoke, a gleaming silver dagger materialized in her hand, thrusting straight toward his throat.

The man gasped in terror, “What do you think you’re doing? Do you have any idea who I am? You dare to kill—” His words choked off as the blade pierced his neck, leaving a gaping wound that gushed blood.

At that very moment, a young woman who had been hiding nearby in fear rushed out with her clothes still disheveled, witnessing Poison Widow’s lethal strike.

“Ah!”

The woman let out a piercing scream upon witnessing this gruesome scene before collapsing in a dead faint.

Later, Poison Widow found herself targeted by relentless assassins. Initially assuming they were old enemies, she eventually discovered the truth: the man she had killed that night was Shan Family’s eldest son, a prominent figure from a powerful martial clan rivaling the Yang Family’s influence.

With the Shan Family’s young master slain and his killer’s appearance burned into the witness’s memory, the clan unleashed endless waves of assassins to avenge their heir. Poison Widow spent months fleeing for her life, narrowly escaping death multiple times. Were it not for timely warnings from allies, she would have perished.

After taking refuge in a friend’s stronghold, the hunt gradually subsided—though Poison Widow knew the Shan Family still sought her. This ordeal catapulted her infamy across the jianghu. Realizing the need for her own power base, she established the Dark Sun Sect with allies’ help. Within a year, over a hundred cultivators flocked to her banner, drawn by her fearsome reputation.

It was only after her rise that the Fang Family took notice and sought alliance.

During a meeting, Bill Lin raised his glass in toast. “Sister Poison’s exploits stir the blood! Truly remarkable, hahaha.”

“You flatter me, Brother Bill,” Poison Widow demurred. “My reputation merely precedes me.”

“Modesty ill becomes you,” Bill Lin countered, studying her reaction. “Now, Guan Yu poses immense danger. Our chances against him seem slim... Might your jianghu connections lend aid? With reinforcements, our odds would improve.”

This had been Bill Lin’s scheme all along—any ally Poison Widow recruited would serve as expendable pawns.

“I could call upon friends,” she admitted, “but I hesitate. Favors demand repayment.”

“Have you forgotten Guan Yu’s vast wealth?” Bill Lin pressed. “Distribute extra shares to your allies. Surely that suffices?”

Poison Widow nodded. The stakes warranted the risk. “Very well. I’ll contact them. Should any come, treat them well.”

Bill Lin beamed. “Naturally! It shall be done…”

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei’s group delivered Fang Su and his father to Yu Gang’s western stronghold.

“Stay vigilant tonight!” Wei barked. “These two are our golden geese. Our fortunes depend on guarding them well!”

“We’ll watch them even if it costs sleep!” the men chorused.

Bound to wooden chairs in a warehouse, the captives endured rotating guards. Guan Yu arrived later, less concerned about ransom than permanent elimination of the Fang threat.

“Boss, all’s secure,” Wei reported. “Hall Masters guard them in shifts.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Rest easy. Bill Lin’s abandoned them. No rescue comes tonight.”

Driving home, Guan Yu asked Xue Jing, “Will Bill Lin attempt to save Fang Su?”

“Unlikely,” she replied. “Saving Poison Widow shows he values her faction over useless Fang Su.”

“Agreed. Bill Lin seeks Poison Widow’s strength against us. We must prepare.”

Xue Jing added, “Though should Poison Widow herself intervene…”

“Impossible,” Guan Yu dismissed. “She’s besieged and kinless to Fang. Her scattered forces won’t regroup.”

“Then our true concern is their alliance. Bill Lin will exploit her as cannon fodder.”

“Let them come,” Guan Yu declared. “I’ll meet every challenge. Bill Lin won’t upend China!”

His bold words heartened Xue Jing, recalling his former fearless self before losing cultivation.

Dawn found Guan Yu rudely awakened. “Rise! Lin Qiaoqiao’s here with urgent news!”

Grumbling about interrupted dreams of landing a giant fish, Guan Yu dressed meticulously in white suit.

“Planning to propose?” Xue Jing teased when he descended.

Lin Qiaoqiao’s breath caught—he wore the same attire from when he’d humiliated Fang Su as her fake beau.

“You took forever!” she snapped, checking her watch. “I’m late! Hand over the Desert Eagle from last night!”

Guan Yu feigned ignorance. “Why?”

“Bullets match that gun! Officers saw you shoot! Surrender it or face arrest for illegal firearms!”

“My protection?”

“Replace it! Unless you want jail!”

Guan Yu lounged, biting an apple. “What if I refuse interrogation?”

“Don’t test me!” Lin fumed. “Give the gun. I’ll erase prints and claim it’s not yours. Deny everything if summoned.”

“Tiresome,” Guan Yu sighed. “Xue Jing, contact Elder Sister. We need political cover.”

Lin protested, “Must you involve higher-ups?”

“This isn’t petty crime,” Guan Yu countered. “Multiple deaths, public gunfire—it’s national news. Without backing, we drown.”

The stakes were clear: without powerful intervention, the storm would consume them all.
