Gao Wei’s attire exuded both sensuality and nobility, trading the allure of her white midday dress for an air of aloof elegance.

Beside her, Guan Yu appeared far more casual. Without the armor of a tailored suit, his relaxed outfit made him resemble a college student—a stark contrast to Gao Wei’s polished presence.

Xu Feng, Gao Wei’s agent, trailed behind them. Though privileged to attend this dinner, her gaze as she observed Guan Yu held complicated layers, her lips sealed.

To Xu Feng, this youth—ostensibly a student—radiated an inexplicable authority that unsettled her. His unassuming demeanor belied a natural command, leaving her uneasy.

“Honored guests, may I inquire which private room you’ve reserved?” A server bowed slightly as the trio approached.

“Ruyi Pavilion,” Guan Yu replied lazily.

The server’s eyes flickered with surprise at his attire but swiftly masked it. Those frequenting this elite establishment defied superficial judgments. With a practiced smile, she guided them inward.

As Feng Minglun’s formally invited guest, Gao Wei led the procession, followed by Xu Feng. Guan Yu—the shameless freeloader—lingered discreetly at the rear.

Inside Ruyi Pavilion awaited four men. Feng Minglun and Bo Jie were familiar faces to Guan Yu; the other two strangers undoubtedly shared Feng’s agenda.

When Gao Wei entered, Feng’s eyes flashed with predatory hunger—swiftly veiled but not unnoticed by Guan Yu. Rising with theatrical warmth, Feng extended a hand. “Miss Gao, what pleasure to meet again.”

As Gao Wei hesitated, Guan Yu materialized behind her, seizing Feng’s proffered hand. “Director Feng! Delighted to reunite!”

Feng recoiled instinctively, his left hand already purple from their last encounter. Doctors had diagnosed minor fractures—souvenirs from Guan Yu’s earlier “handshake.” The right hand now joined its sibling in agony.

Had decorum allowed, Feng might have smashed his elbow into Guan Yu’s grinning face. Instead, he retreated to his seat, hands throbbing, thwarted from further advances.

Gao Wei shot Guan Yu a grateful glance before seating herself. The young man sprawled beside her, immediately drawing hostile glares from four directions. Bo Jie’s murderous stare spoke of their midday altercation in the dressing room, while Feng’s companions radiated shared resentment.

Where beauties gather, battles brew.

Before Guan Yu’s chair warmed, he’d antagonized every man present. “Being a beauty’s faux beau is thankless work,” he mused, chewing vigorously as courses arrived.

Protocol demanded Feng offer a toast to commence the meal. But as the executive half-rose, Guan Yu lunged for the braised beef. “Try this!” he urged Gao Wei through a full mouth, plopping meat into her bowl.

The actress bit back laughter while Feng hovered awkwardly between standing and sitting.

“Eat up!” Guan Yu waved chopsticks dismissively. “The crispy duck’s divine.”

Feng’s ally Li Dayong intervened: “Director Feng, won’t you introduce our guests?”

“Ah yes! Our new brand ambassador, Miss Gao Wei, her agent Xu Feng, and...” Feng’s gaze hardened on the chewing youth, “...her companion, whom I don’t believe we’ve met.”

Li pounced: “A student friend, perhaps? No need to rush—meals here can be boxed for dormmates.” His smirk implied pauper’s manners.

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. “Really? I can take leftovers?”

“Order whatever you wish,” Feng forced through gritted teeth.

Beaming, Guan Yu summoned the menu. After faux deliberation, he declared: “Except these three dishes, prepare everything else—to go. Oh, and six bottles of this Bordeaux.”

Silence gripped the room.

Feng’s eyelid twitched at the financial hemorrhage—this feast would cost half his annual salary. Yet pride demanded compliance. “Your... friends are fortunate.”

“Their fortune is your generosity!” Guan Yu grinned, grease-shined hand outstretched. Feng recoiled as from a viper.

**Chapter 508: Booking You For The Night**

Wine-loosened tongues soon lowered Feng’s guard. Leaning across the table, he fixed Gao Wei with liquored boldness: “Miss Gao, your every smile haunts me. Deepen our... collaboration, and I’ll ensure your permanent reign as Dior’s China ambassador.”

Bo Jie slammed his glass. “You overstep, Feng!”

“Silence!” Feng sneered. “You’re disposable—a puppet I can unstring tomorrow.”

Gao Wei’s porcelain skin flushed with fury rather than wine. Before she could retort, Guan Yu’s chuckle cut through: “Director Feng’s generosity already astounds. Perhaps next he’ll offer to book starlets by the hour?”

The room froze. Feng’s face purpled, veins bulging. Guan Yu merely raised his stolen Lafite in mock toast, the embodiment of cheerful ruin.
