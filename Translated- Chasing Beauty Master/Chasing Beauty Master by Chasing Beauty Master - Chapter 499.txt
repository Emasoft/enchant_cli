If Guan Yu hadn’t been able to knock Bowen down with a single move, his life would have been in grave danger. Now, the situation was reversed—though both lay on the ground, Guan Yu could at least stand and speak, while Bowen remained unconscious.

This skirmish left Guan Yu satisfied. Not only had he gained ample time to observe Bowen’s martial techniques—a formidable Earth-rank skill—he also felt confident that mastering it through diligent practice was achievable.

What pleased him more than acquiring the technique was his newfound inspiration to refine it. Though bold, the idea was theoretically feasible.

Too weakened to linger, Guan Yu left the Advanced Magic Training Grounds supported by Amy and Shao Siming.

Watching their retreating figures, a voice in the crowd hissed, “Refining techniques? Hmph! That brat’s no joke. I must inform Young Master Locke!”

Returning to his quarters with Amy’s aid, Guan Yu collapsed onto his bed, exhausted. Soon, a servant rushed in: “Miss Amy, Young Master Guan, the Patriarch has arrived!”

“Father’s here?” Amy paled, hastily urging Guan Yu, “Brother Longzu, stay in bed! Don’t tell him I took you to the Advanced Training Grounds!”

“Why?”

“Just trust me!”

Before Guan Yu could reply, a voice chuckled from the doorway: “Trust her? Little imp, always scheming!”

“Hmph! Are you even my real father? Look how dutiful I’ve been!” Amy protested, bustling to fetch a stool and pour tea for Allen.

Waving off her flurry, Allen sighed, “Enough. I already know. Rest assured—I won’t punish you. This was Young Master Guan’s own doing.”

Guan Yu nodded awkwardly. “Nothing escapes your sight, Patriarch. Since returning from the Isle of Life, my constitution has subtly transformed under the Life Source’s influence. My perception and control of magical elements now far surpass before. What I need now is实战 to deepen my understanding of magic’s essence.”

“Well said!” Allen’s eyes gleamed with approval. He admired Guan Yu’s potential, knowing full well that had the youth employed non-magical strengths against Bowen, the outcome would have differed.

Amy blinked innocently. “Brother Longzu, Father—what are you talking about?”

Allen snorted. “Blame yourself for slacking in training! Young Master Guan has surpassed you in mere days!”

“I train hard! Besides, Brother Longzu’s a genius—how can I compare?”

“Enough,” Allen sighed before turning grave. “Young Master Guan, I bring news of the Crystal Toad.”

**Chapter 1264: The Crystal Toad**

“Crystal Toad?” Fatigue forgotten, Guan Yu straightened. Though clueless about its purpose, the fierce competition among factions marked it as invaluable. As a treasure enthusiast, he couldn’t let this slip by.

Allen’s expression darkened. “The latest news isn’t favorable.”

Guan Yu’s heart sank—had someone claimed it?

“Patriarch, you mean—”

“Not yet,” Allen cut in. “But traces have been spotted. Only its agility prevents capture.”

Relieved it remained unclaimed, Guan Yu resolved to leave the Elven Forest. Though magic study mattered, the Crystal Toad’s allure outweighed all.

“Your intention, Patriarch?”

“I know you desire it,” Allen said bluntly. “But our Life Source dwindles. Having witnessed its importance, will you help us secure the Toad?”

“And if I claim it for myself?”

Allen smiled wryly. “We’ll reward you with a peak Earth-rank technique.”

Tempting as it was, Guan Yu hesitated. “I’ll agree—but what does the Toad truly do?”

Allen relented. “The Crystal Toad’s translucent body regenerates damaged tissue. But its true power lies in post-regeneration amplification—each healing multiplies strength. For a初级 mage, this could rival中级; a魔导士 might挑战魔导师!”

Guan Yu’s breath caught. If Locke obtained this, he’d gain power to overthrow Allen, exploiting the elves’ Life Source crisis. Having barely defeated Bowen—a mere大魔法师—Guan Yu shuddered imagining facing魔导士 Locke.

“I’ll secure the Toad,” Guan Yu vowed. “But why choose me over stronger elves?”

“I see your hidden strengths,” Allen said meaningfully. “But more importantly, I trust you. They… do not.”

**Chapter 1265: Stop Chasing Me**

Guan Yu marveled at Allen’s foresight—he’d long suspected Locke’s rebellion yet tolerated him as guard captain. Such restraint spoke volumes.

Their discussion halted as soft snores arose. Amy had dozed off on a bamboo couch.

“When do I depart?” Guan Yu asked.

“The Toad emerges more frequently during full moons. The next is in three days.”

“I’ll leave at dawn tomorrow.”

At first light, Guan Yu crept out only to encounter an unexpected figure—Roxy, whom he’d avoided since their awkward encounter.

“Leaving?” she asked stiffly.

He nodded, tension thickening until Roxy turned to leave.

“Roxy!”

She froze as he embraced her. Tears spilled as she clung back.

“I’m sorry,” he murmured. “When I return, I’ll take you with me.”

“I’ll wait,” she whispered.

Emerging from the Elven Forest, Guan Yu pondered the Toad’s whereabouts when his companion, Jin Gang, warned of approaching energy.

Leaping into a tree, he watched a black-clad figure dart below, pursued by shouts: “Stop!”

The figure halted, pleading, “Stop chasing me! It’s annoying!”

A woman’s voice.

Grinning, Guan Yu dropped between them. “Gentlemen, bullying a lady?”

The lead pursuer, a mustached youth, sneered. “Boy, know who we are? Scram!”
