“Pfft…” Blowing off the residual ash from the blade, Guan Yu examined the newly sharpened knife. Its edge gleamed wickedly. He lightly prodded the wooden bed frame, the tip sinking in effortlessly. With a satisfied smirk, he sheathed the weapon and tucked it into his robe.

At a roadside eatery, Guan Yu devoured a bamboo steamer of buns before striding onto the street. Though unfamiliar with the area, he followed traffic signs toward Shiqing Road with measured steps. Beneath flickering streetlamps, he paused at a fruit stall to inquire directions. Learning Di Yaya’s location, he moved like a shadow toward the neon-lit entertainment complex.

The parking lot overflowed with luxury vehicles. Standing beneath pulsing neon, Guan Yu studied the gaudy signboard before entering.

“Welcome, sir. Are you alone?”

Guan Yu nodded curtly. “The billiards club – where’s the staircase?” His calm demeanor gave no hint of murderous intent as he addressed the attendant.

“This way, please.” The server guided him through opulent halls to an elevator adorned in imperial gold, every surface screaming decadence. The doors parted on the third floor to reveal a bustling billiards hall. Dozens of youths clustered around green-felt tables under crystal chandeliers.

Selecting a cue from the rack, Guan Yu prowled the perimeter.

“Playing alone, sir? Shall I find you a companion?” A curvaceous hostess offered with saccharine sweetness.

“No need.” His gaze swept the room until landing on Zhao Xu – the man whose face he’d memorized during Fu Linlin’s fatal plunge.

As Zhao Xu bent over a shot, Guan Yu approached. With calculated nonchalance, he jabbed the cue’s thick end into the man’s backside.

“The fuck?!” Zhao Xu whirled, only to meet a whistling cue across his face. The crack of splintering wood echoed as gravity-enhanced force smashed him onto the table, features distorting grotesquely. Blood and teeth sprayed across green felt.

“You bastard!” Zhao Xu’s crew surged forward. Guan Yu hurled the broken cue like a javelin, skewering the lead attacker’s neck.

“Back off!” He barked at the remaining men, advancing on the twitching Zhao Xu. “Which hand did it?”

The semi-conscious man gurgled incoherently. Guan Yu seized the right wrist, pinning it beneath his boot. The fruit knife flashed down, impaling Zhao Xu’s palm with a sickening crunch.

Screams filled the hall as Guan Yu twisted the blade, snapping it off in bone. He rose, aiming a steel-toed kick between the man’s legs—

“HALT!”

A woman emerged from the elevator – late twenties, black suit draping a lethal frame. Raven hair framed cold eyes as she snapped fingers. A bodyguard drew a pistol.

Guan Yu barely registered the warning before her polished loafer connected with his gut, sending him crashing against marble walls.

“Barging into my territory?” She sneered, circling her prey. “Still want to play hero?”

Clutching his abdomen, Guan Yu triggered healing magic. Pain dissolved into vibrating energy. He lunged, using her body as shield against the gunman. Blunted steel pressed into her sternum.

“Clear the room!” He barked, blade at her throat.

“You’ll never leave alive,” she hissed, even as her men retreated.

“Try me.” The knife drew blood. “Drop the gun!”

As the weapon clattered, Guan Yu maneuvered toward windows. Three stories up – survivable with gravity control. But the woman’s laughter froze him.

“Kill me, and my people will slaughter everyone you love.”

Guan Yu’s grip tightened. “Then you’ll die first.”

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: The Fierce Woman**

The standoff shattered as Guan Yu spun, hurling them both through glass. Wind whipped hair as they plummeted—

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Unleashing Carnage**

Mid-fall, Guan Yu reversed their positions. Concrete rushed up as he channeled weightlessness. They hit the pavement in a roll, the woman’s body cushioning his impact.

Before the gunman could aim, Guan Yu vanished into shadows. His voice echoed from alleys: “This isn’t over!”

Back inside, Zhao Xu’s whimpers mixed with the clink of broken glass. The woman rose, dabbing her neck. “Find him. I want that rat’s head.”

Somewhere in the neon jungle, Guan Yu smiled. Let them come. Tonight’s dance had just begun.
