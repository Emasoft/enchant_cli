“Auntie, let me help you. You’ve been busy all day—why don’t you sit and rest for a while?” Qiaoqiao offered.

Xiaozhu paid no attention to the adults’ affairs, while Guanyu surveyed the room’s furnishings. The space was modestly equipped with old appliances: a vintage cassette player-radio combo, relics of an era long vanished from cities. A battered washing machine and a small fridge, both seemingly ancient, occupied a corner, their functionality uncertain. Despite these relics, Guanyu noticed the absence of a television.

“No TV?” he whispered to Qiaoqiao. “Why have other appliances but not a TV? I thought everyone prioritized buying one first.”

Qiaoqiao replied softly, “There’s no TV signal here. What’s the use? This isn’t your mansion. Even these old appliances were gifts from my dad years ago. Otherwise, there’d be nothing.”

Guanyu nodded, realizing the remoteness likely deterred satellite installation. “That man earlier must be your uncle? He seems decent,” he murmured.

In the center of the room stood a square table beside a traditional kang—a heated brick bed—where Xiaozhu had already kicked off her shoes and bounced onto the platform.

“This region is southern, with mild winters. Why do they have a northern-style kang here?” Guanyu wondered aloud.

Qiaoqiao explained, “I’m not entirely sure, but winters here are damp and chilly. Sleeping on regular beds harms the body over time, so every household builds a kang. When humidity sets in, they light a fire beneath to warm it.”

Guanyu found this reasoning sound. As he chatted with Qiaoqiao by the kang, the aunt and uncle soon returned.

“I haven’t introduced you yet—” the aunt began.

“Let me do it!” Qiaoqiao interjected. “Uncle, don’t you recognize me?”

“You’re… Qiaoqiao? My, how you’ve grown! So beautiful now—I almost didn’t recognize you!”

“Yes, it’s me! I visited as a child. This is my boyfriend, Guanyu. Guanyu, this is my uncle—you can call him Uncle too.”

Guanyu rose with a smile. “Hello, Uncle. We came in a hurry and didn’t bring gifts. Please forgive the oversight.”

The uncle blinked in surprise. “What a handsome pair, heaven-made! No need for gifts—just visit often!”

As everyone settled comfortably, the aunt’s lingering curiosity resurfaced. Last night, Xiaozhu and Qiaoqiao had both dashed to Guanyu’s room to “play cards”—with Xiaozhu even forgetting her clothes. The aunt longed to ask but hesitated, noting Xiaozhu’s clinginess to Guanyu.

With the urgency of catching the mystical beast, the uncle excused himself to check the water heater. Once alone, Guanyu asked, “This village is serene but isolated. What’s the story behind the giant tree at the entrance?”

Qiaoqiao echoed his curiosity. “Auntie, tell us about the tree!”

The aunt obliged. “That tree predates my arrival. Legends say it’s centuries old, but its true origins are a mystery.”

Lín Qiǎoqiǎo interjected, “How did you and Uncle meet?”

Guanyu shot her an amused glance. “Since when are you so nosy?”

Xiaozhu perked up, ears keen. The aunt chuckled. “Fate, I suppose. Your mother and I ran a humble tailor shop in town. We mended clothes for laborers—your uncle among them. His worn work clothes brought him to us often, and… well, here we are.”

“So you’re a seamstress? That’s amazing!” Xiaozhu exclaimed.

“Hush, you.” The aunt swatted playfully. “We altered garments for practicality, not fashion. Your uncle’s well-fitted clothes? My handiwork.”

Guanyu admired, “Such skill is rare nowadays. In cities, people discard torn clothes. Your talent would shine there.”

“Mom, keep going!” Xiaozhu urged.

The aunt continued, “Your uncle courted me through those visits. Back then, your mother and I were sought-after beauties!”

Lín Qiǎoqiǎo grinned. “You’re still stunning, Auntie! Age hasn’t dimmed your charm.”

Guanyu agreed silently; both sisters had aged gracefully, their daughters inheriting their loveliness.

“What about my parents?” Lín Qiǎoqiǎo pressed.

“Ah, their meeting was… unconventional.” The aunt stifled laughter. “Your father, drunk and desperate, stumbled into our shop seeking a restroom. When your mother asked what he needed, he gasped, ‘Toilet!’—then relieved himself right there!”

Xiaozhu gasped. “He peed himself?!”

“Mind your tongue!” the aunt scolded, though laughter bubbled through. “Your mother, ever quick-witted, shut the shop to spare his dignity. She gave him clean clothes and hid the incident. Afterwards, he frequented our shop—out of gratitude… or attraction.”

Lín Qiǎoqiǎo howled. “Dad’s secret shame! I’ll never let him live this down!”

Guanyu chuckled. “So their romance began with… urinary urgency?”

“Precisely! Your mother’s cleverness won him over. He brought clients, they grew close, and the rest is history.”

Lín Qiǎoqiǎo marveled. “Mom pursued Dad? Unbelievable! She acts so demure now.”

“City life enforces monogamy,” Guanyu mused. “Had they stayed rural, perhaps…” He trailed off, realizing his blunder.

Lín Qiǎoqiǎo glared. “Are you implying Dad’s loyalty is legal compulsion, not love? You’ve plenty of women yourself!”

The aunt’s eyes narrowed. “Guanyu has many women?”

Xiaozhu shrugged. “Men keep mistresses—even city ones. No big deal.”

Adults gaped at the girl’s worldly remark.

The rustic cottage, though humble, was tidy—a fact Lín Qiǎoqiǎo appreciated. Guanyu imagined wealthier acquaintances like Yáng Cónghán or Lǚ Méi recoiling here.

As the uncle returned, announcing hot water, Xiaozhu waved him off. “We’re gossiping! Later!”

Resuming, the aunt explained how Lín Qiǎoqiǎo’s mother shielded her future husband’s dignity, sparking a bond that defied social strata. “Your father, a noble’s son, became our patron. Slowly, love bloomed.”

“So Mom charmed him with mercy,” Lín Qiǎoqiǎo mused. “Who’d guess she was so bold?”

“Destiny works oddly,” the aunt said. “In their village, men took multiple wives, yet your father remained devoted. City laws helped, but their love was genuine.”

Guanyu’s earlier comment hung awkwardly until Lín Qiǎoqiǎo snapped, “You’ve no room to judge—your harem’s notorious!”

Regret flashed across her face as the aunt pounced. “Harem? Guanyu, explain!”

Before he could, Xiaozhu interjected, “Modern men have side chicks. Normal!”

The room stared, torn between shock and amusement at the girl’s audacity.
