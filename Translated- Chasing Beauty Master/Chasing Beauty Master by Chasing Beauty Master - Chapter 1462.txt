“Elder Lu, why the hurry to leave? Come, sit down and let’s talk properly. What urgent matter requires such haste?” Elder Mu could no longer restrain himself. A fragrant roast chicken lay on the table—to let it go without fine wine would be a crime against heaven.

Moreover, Elder Lu’s prized liquor wasn’t something ordinary people could taste. How could Elder Mu resist? He stood and pulled Elder Lu back to his seat.

“First set down the wine jar. We’ll discuss matters slowly. Look at your impatience—ready to storm off at a moment’s notice.” Elder Mu wrested the wine jar from Elder Lu’s hands and placed it firmly on the table.

Elder Lu’s expression remained frosty. “You know full well why I’m here. Since you refuse to help, there’s nothing left to discuss. I might as well seek our Sect Leader directly. Whether he permits it or not, I must see Xiao Zhi for Yunqing Sect’s sake. I fear no man’s judgment.”

“Ah, Elder Lu! You’re absolutely right—this humble one admits fault. But must your temper blaze hotter by the day? Sit, sit. Let us speak calmly.” Elder Mu coaxed.

Seeing this conciliatory tone, Elder Lu sensed room for negotiation. His demeanor softened as he took his seat.

Elder Mu smiled. “I know everything you do is for Yunqing Sect’s welfare. Wait here while I dismiss the guard disciples. During their shift change, you may visit Xiao Zhi. This matter must remain hidden from our Sect Leader. Even Bamboo Peak disciples shouldn’t witness it.”

“That’s acceptable. I’ll follow your arrangements. If you enable this meeting, Elder Mu, you’ll have my deepest gratitude. Henceforth, whenever you desire fine wine, simply send word and I’ll deliver it personally.”

**Chapter 3810: Iron Needs Rice, Steel Requires Grain**

Today’s gifts hadn’t been wasted—the other party had acquiesced. The information came from Elder Zheng’s faction, convincing Elder Lu that Xiao Zhi must possess crucial intelligence requiring this clandestine meeting.

“Very well. The guard shift changes in half a shichen. I’ll dismiss the disciples—you’ll have half an incense stick’s time. Not a moment longer. If discovered by returning guards, don’t you dare implicate me.”

Elder Lu chuckled. “Worry not. Half an incense stick suffices. I’ll await your signal here.”

Time flowed swiftly. When half a shichen passed, Elder Mu rose. “Follow me. After I divert the guards, proceed to Xiao Zhi. Here’s the key—return it afterward.”

Nodding compliance, Elder Lu followed to the prison’s shadowed corner. Elder Mu approached two gatekeepers: “Both of you—come with me. There’s urgent business.”

“Master, should both leave? We just began our night watch. The post would be unmanned,” objected a dutiful disciple.

“When your elder commands, you obey! Bamboo Peak’s defenses are impregnable. No harm will come.”

Day shifts required single guards, nights demanded pairs. As dusk deepened, the evening guards had just relieved their daytime counterparts.

Watching Elder Mu lead the disciples away, Elder Lu slipped to the cell door. The key turned smoothly. Inside, Xiao Zhi sat meditating to regulate his chaotic spiritual energy, startled by the intrusion.

Seeing Elder Lu enter, Xiao Zhi’s spirit lifted—Wang Jun had kept his promise after all!

“Uncle Lu! You came!” Xiao Zhi scrambled to his feet.

Noticing untouched food trays by the door, Elder Lu’s face darkened. “Child, starving yourself despite injuries? This self-neglect harms you gravely.”

Xiao Zhi sighed. “Elder Lu, how could I eat in this place? Wrongfully accused, consumed by thoughts of vindication—what appetite remains?”

“Child, iron needs rice as steel requires grain! Should you sicken from starvation, what becomes of us? Of your parents? While we labor for your exoneration, you squander our efforts through self-destruction. Is this how you repay us?”

Xiao Zhi hung his head. “Your rebuke is just. I erred. Henceforth, I’ll eat every meal without complaint.”

“Good. Remember—though confined, many fight for your justice. The spiritual energy I spent decades cultivating revived your life. Don’t waste this gift.”

“I understand, Uncle Lu.” Xiao Zhi’s voice cracked. Coddled since childhood under Elder Zheng’s protection, this imprisonment weighed heavily.

“Time is short. You summoned me—what matters require telling?”

“I must expose someone—Yan Zhao.”

“Yan Zhao?” Elder Lu frowned. “What charges? Has he betrayed our sect?”

“He’s a Demon Sect spy. The black-furred monsters at Yunqing Sect, the murder of Left Void Peak’s disciple A’cai—all Yan Zhao’s deeds. Infected with Blood Toxin at Black Blood Ridge, he’s controlled by the Blood Lord. After Guan Yu destroyed that nest, Yan Zhao survived through Devil Soul Sect’s patronage. Every full moon, his Blood Toxin flares unless suppressed by their antidote.”

“Impossible!” Elder Lu protested. “Evidence?”

Xiao Zhi shook his head bitterly. “None. Precisely why I sought you. Others would dismiss this as baseless slander.”

“Worse—they’d accuse you of defaming our senior disciple, compounding your crimes.”

“Thus I confide only in you. Every word is truth.”

“Without proof, what logic supports this?”

“Recent realizations. Whenever black-furred monsters attacked—at Yunqing Sect, when Guan Yu nearly died—Yan Zhao vanished, reappearing days later.”

“Circumstantial at best. Substantiate your claims.”

“At Tiger Mouth Village, Yan Zhao obstructed us repeatedly. When Guan Yu exposed him at the inn, they battled until Yan Zhao fled through windows. Disbelieving his treachery, I pursued him... only to walk into his trap during our return.”

“Elaborate! Did Yan Zhao attack you? How does Blood Toxin spread?”

**Chapter 3811: Kowtow of Gratitude**

“Uncle Lu, you may not know—my transformation at Tiger Head Peak resulted from Blood Toxin. Victims become murderous beasts during flare-ups, dying exhausted of essence-blood without antidotes.”

“You imply Yan Zhao infected you? If contagious, hasn’t he spread it widely?”

“Direct transmission requires contact with tainted blood. Yan Zhao added his blood to my medicinal broth during our return. That’s how I was poisoned.”

“Plausible, yet without witnesses...”

“He sought to eliminate me publicly at Tiger Head Peak’s hall—discrediting Guan Yu and I simultaneously. With us executed, his secrets remain buried.”

“Such depth of scheming... For decades, Yan Zhao stood as Yunqing’s model disciple. Who’d suspect Demon Sect collusion?”

“Why would our rising star serve demons? What could they offer beyond his current prestige?”

“Test him, Uncle Lu! The truth will emerge.”

“If proven, justice shall prevail. Tomorrow, Tiger Head Peak hosts sect-wide inspections. Should Yan Zhao’s infection be confirmed, your innocence shines forth.”

“At last!” Xiao Zhi exhaled in relief. “May that scum receive his due!”

Checking the time, Elder Lu rose. “I must depart. Any final words?”

“Only gratitude for saving my life.” Xiao Zhi kowtowed thrice, forehead striking stone until bruised purple.

“Child, unnecessary!” Elder Lu lifted him urgently. “I trust your character—raised under Elder Zheng’s guidance, you’d never betray us. My actions serve righteousness.”

“My life owes to decades of your cultivated energy. How can I repay this debt?”

“Energy regenerates—lives don’t. Survive, child. Keep hope.” With final shoulder clasp, Elder Lu departed.

Heart lightened, Xiao Zhi devoured the cold meal—never had stale prison fare tasted sweeter. His secret burden lifted, he willed Yan Zhao’s imminent exposure.

**Chapter 3812: The Parting Gift**

Guan Yu sat immersed in a wooden tub, Wang Xiaorong guarding against disturbances. Though secure within Devil Soul Sect’s walls, her concern mounted—what began as warm water now emitted chilling vapors, its surface nearly frozen.

Tentatively testing the water, Wang Xiaorong jerked back from the icy shock. “Guan Yu! Please be safe...” she whispered, battling panic.

When half a shichen passed without change, she reached to rouse him—only for violent coughs to erupt suddenly.

“Cough! Cough! Cough...”

“Guan Yu!” She rushed forward with thick towels.

“F-freezing!” He leaped out, teeth chattering. Wang Xiaorong swathed him immediately.

“Need dry clothes! Quick!” After drying and dressing, Guan Yu cocooned himself in quilts, color returning to his lips.

“Close call... but success!”

“You’ve mastered it? Oh, Guan Yu!” Her joy faded as implications surfaced. “Now you’ll leave...”

“Our future holds reunion,” he comforted. “When this ends, I’ll take you to my homeland—countless wonders await.”

“I’ll wait eternally.” She forced a smile. “Just... come back for Xiao Zhi safely.”

As Guan Yu envisioned returning to Yunqing Sect, determination solidified—Xiao Zhi’s liberation neared.
