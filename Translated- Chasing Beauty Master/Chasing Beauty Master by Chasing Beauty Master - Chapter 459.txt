“Haha, we’ve searched for him so long. Since he isn’t with us, he must have claimed the benefits of this inheritance ground. If he surrenders them obediently, we’ll grant him a clean death. Otherwise, we’ll refine him into a Mystic Corpse, condemning his soul to eternal unrest.” The Cult Master of the Demonic Sect now appeared far from pristine. Violet light flickered across his body, his once pale skin turned pitch-black—clearly struck by Lightning Arts. Though seemingly unharmed aside from dishevelment, his venomous tone revealed a bone-deep hatred for Ye Qingling (Clear Spirit).

“Guan Yu, hand over Ye Qingling and the treasures of the inheritance ground. We might spare your life.” Qing Fu (Green Bat) sneered, his dagger dancing in his hand as he stared triumphantly at Guan Yu. Xiang Tiansheng (Heavenborn Xiang) nearby had already activated his talismans, while Ren Qiansha (Thousand Slayer Ren) stood motionless, his murderous aura palpable.

“Hmm…”

Guan Yu’s face darkened. With a flash of violet light at his feet, he vanished.

“Roar…”

A small white tiger phantom streaked through the air. Xiang Tiansheng was sent flying, his face frozen in disbelief even mid-air.

“How dare you—!”

*Crack!* The sound of snapping bones echoed as Xiang Tiansheng flew like a cannonball struck by a truck, landing lifelessly.

Qing Fu teleported beside the unconscious Ye Qingling, dagger poised to strike—only to freeze as primal terror gripped him. He vanished again, but the dread clung like a curse.

“Still running?” Cold light flashed in Guan Yu’s eyes.

*Boom…*

*Thud…*

Qing Fu’s eyes widened in shock as Guan Yu’s kick sent him spinning through the air. Before he could right himself, another kick followed. After twenty bone-crushing strikes, Qing Fu collapsed as a mangled corpse.

“Impossible! How is he this fast?” Ren Qiansha paled. Two elite demonic cultivators—one dead, one crippled—in moments? Since when had Guan Yu grown so strong?

Ren Qiansha fled toward the demonic faction’s gathering point. Safety in numbers would neutralize Guan Yu’s threat.

“Ngh…”

“Hm?”

As Guan Yu moved to pursue, Ye Qingling stirred awake. Reluctantly halting, Guan Yu channeled vital energy into her, administering a White Cloud Temple healing pill. Though inferior to ancient elixirs, it stabilized her weakened life force.

“Qingling, what happened? Why were you alone? Did your Eldest Senior Brother betray us? Where are the others?” Guan Yu’s questions tumbled urgently. The thought of Kunlun’s chief disciple colluding with demons was unthinkable—yet here they stood.

“I argued with Eldest Senior Brother… He went mad! He ambushed Sister Zuo, but Zhang Xiaojun and Fa Neng saved her. Then… he allied with demons! We’re trapped at a stone tablet. Zhang Xiaojun’s formation array bought time to send me for help. Guan Yu, please save them!” The fifteen-year-old’s fragmented account painted a dire picture. Yin Ye’s jealousy had driven him to madness.

Whatever the reason, you’ve harmed my friends. You’ll pay, Yin Ye. I’m coming.

“Calm yourself. Can you still fight?” Guan Yu’s voice steadied. The balance of power had shifted catastrophically. With demonic factions converging, their only hope lay in strategy—retreat never crossed his mind. Surrender to fear? That wasn’t his nature.

“Sister Zuo shielded me. I’m unharmed, just drained from Thunder Evasion. I can fight. But Guan Yu—charging headlong against four late-stage Golden Core experts and their minions? It’s suicide!”

“Some paths demand walking. Some faces demand confronting. Show me the way.” Guan Yu resolved to go alone. If Qingling survived, the truth would outlive him.

“Vajra, is there sanctuary here? Can she be sent out?” Guan Yu mentally queried his artifact spirit.

“None leave without inheriting the monument. Three li ahead lies the Demon-Subduing Radiance Array. Here’s its control method. Must you go?” Vajra’s tone held concern.

“They’re my comrades. My debtors. I must.” Guan Yu’s resolve crystallized. Fear lingered, but courage outweighed it.

“Good! A true cultivator walks his path! Though unworthy of wielding the Demon-Subduing Staff fully, I’ll lend three strikes. Each can cripple a late Golden Core!” Vajra’s voice thrilled with battle-lust.

“Aren’t you a war artifact? Don’t pretend disinterest.” Guan Yu sent the array knowledge to Qingling. His confidence stemmed from the staff—without it, recklessness would be folly.

“Guan Yu, you—”

“No arguments. Wait at the array. If I succeed, I’ll find you. If not…” His gentle firmness brooked no debate.

Qingling bit back tears and fled. Better a living witness than a dead burden.

**Chapter 1162: Battling the Horde of Demons (Part 2)**

Guan Yu emerged, the twelve-foot ebony staff radiating soul-chilling gloom. His lone approach felt like an advancing army.

“DIE, GUAN YU!” Qing Tian (Sky Lifter) materialized above, a colossal violet hammer swelling to sixty feet. The sky darkened under its descent.

*Clang!*

The hammer shattered. Qing Tian flew backward, vomiting blood, plowing a furrow through earth. The crowd gaped—their arrogance crumbling before Guan Yu’s casual might.

“Is this your welcome?” Guan Yu strolled forward, eyes locking on the retreating Yin Ye. That strike had channeled the inheritance ground’s power through Vajra’s guidance. One of three chances spent.

“Why?” Guan Yu’s staff pointed at Yin Ye.

“Why?!” Yin Ye laughed bitterly, clutching the Apricot Yellow Banner. “Decades of service to Kunlun, yet I remain a placeholder! The legacy artifacts? Reserved for the Sect Master’s son. My marriage proposal? Denied. Even Qingling scorned me!”

“Your grievances aren’t my concern. You chose demons.”

“Allies of convenience! These wretches?” Yin Ye’s banner unfurled, golden lotuses shielding him.

“A flawed imitation.” At Vajra’s prompt, Guan Yu’s staff shattered the legendary defense. Yin Ye flew like a broken doll, life flickering.

“He broke the Apricot Yellow Banner?!” Onlookers trembled. The “peerless defense” myth lay shattered.

“Dear Guan, I’ve stayed neutral. May I leave?” Lü Wu (Green Mist) smiled tensely. Ren Qiansha had already vanished.

Guan Yu exhaled, pallor revealing the toll. Three divine strikes had drained him—yet the demons’ fear preserved his bluff.

The battlefield stilled, balance of power rewritten in a staff’s shadow.
