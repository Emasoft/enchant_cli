“While the monster was fleeing, the village chief mustered his last reserves of spiritual energy to activate the silver sword artifact, severing the creature’s tail into the river.

After that incident, an inexplicable plague ravaged the village for months, afflicting not just humans but even livestock. The epidemic proved catastrophic, claiming countless lives.

At the brink of the village’s annihilation, a mysterious cultivator arrived. Through arcane arts, he purged the plague, saving the dwindling population.

Later invited to the chief’s home, this cultivator discovered the chief’s wounds from battling the monster had never healed. Toxins from the creature’s claws had festered within him. Though the cultivator suppressed the venom, even he couldn’t fully eradicate it.

Years passed without incident until the village’s river began mysteriously dwindling. Just as fears of drought arose, a sapling sprouted midstream. Defying seasons, it grew rapidly—verdant even in winter’s frost.

Within a year, the sapling thickened to a meter-wide trunk, transforming the river into a brook. Remarkably, it absorbed all floodwaters during storms, protecting the village. Hailed as a Divine Tree, it became sacred.

Yet calamity lingered. The old chief’s suppressed toxins proved hereditary. Three descendants inherited the corruption, transforming into bloodthirsty beasts requiring fresh blood to survive. My son’s current state is but the initial phase. Left unchecked, he’ll evolve into an ancient winged demon clad in scales.”

The aged chief’s voice trembled. “We later discovered the Divine Tree grew from the monster’s severed tail. Its wood carries the same venom. Those afflicted find solace beneath its boughs... and their corruption accelerates.”

As understanding dawned on the crowd, Guan Yu demanded, “If your son became a monster, why spare him? Don’t you realize the danger?”

“How could I kill my own child?” The chief wept. “At first he only preyed on livestock. But now... Now the bloodlust consumes him.”

Third Elder Wen interjected, “Your family’s cultivation arts should ensure longevity. Why has your lineage dwindled?”

“Our ancestral manuals pass only to males,” the chief explained. “Moreover, the land’s spiritual energy wanes. Few achieve advanced cultivation now.”

Lin Qiaoqiao suggested, “Why not relocate? This cursed place isn’t worth clinging to!”

But Guan Yu turned to the Divine Tree. “If you knew its origin, why preserve this poison?”

“After the plague, none dared touch it,” the chief admitted. “We feared disturbing it might resurrect the scourge.”

As villagers debated, Silvermane—the chief’s uncle—barked, “None shall leave! Secrets stay buried here!”

Swords flashed. Silvermane pressed his blade to the chief’s throat. “Destroy that accursed tree. Now.”

Under duress, the chief raised his staff. Arcane sigils shimmered as thunderous energy gathered above the Divine Tree. The crowd watched breathlessly—this ancient evil’s reckoning had come.
