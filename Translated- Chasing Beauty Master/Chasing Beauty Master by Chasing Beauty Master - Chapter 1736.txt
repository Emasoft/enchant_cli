“Keeping a serpent by your side might be tolerable if others remain unaware, but now that everyone knows, the thought of having a giant serpent around all day would unsettle anyone. Don’t you agree?” Guan Yu persuaded.

If Xiao Mei could leave her younger sister within the Jiayi Sect, matters would ease considerably, and none of the fellow disciples would voice complaints. Otherwise, this situation would prove difficult to resolve.

Xiao Mei replied, “I refuse. I intend to take my younger sister on training and cultivation journeys. Leaving her in the Jiayi Sect would hinder her progress. Would that not be unwise?”

“Cultivation isn’t limited to venturing outward. Often, cultivating in tranquility enhances one’s abilities far more,” Guan Yu persisted. “Take my master, for instance. He hasn’t left the sect for decades, nor ventured down the mountain for training. Cultivation takes many forms—it need not always involve travel.”

“Your master may not require such journeys, but my younger sister does.” Xiao Mei’s resolute expression made it clear no argument would sway her. She would keep her sister by her side.

Guan Yu now regretted not setting terms earlier. His frustration grew as he realized further persuasion was futile.

“Very well. If you insist, I’ll say no more. But I advise you to keep your sister hidden. Do not startle others with her presence,” Guan Yu conceded reluctantly.

“That won’t do either,” Xiao Mei refused. “If I bring her for training, she must roam freely. I cannot confine her indefinitely. What if prolonged restraint harms her?”

Guan Yu frowned. This woman was immovable. Were it not for needing her cooperation, he would never endure such obstinacy.

Xiao Mei’s true motive lay undisclosed. Her claim of “training journeys” was a ruse. Her real aim was to reach Miao City—a realm dominated by demons, where animals might outnumber humanoid beings. A serpent could navigate its streets far easier than a human.

Her sister, now capable of understanding speech, would stealthily search for the Eight-Drum Technique within Miao City. A serpent’s agility made this mission possible. Thus, Xiao Mei’s insistence stemmed from necessity, not mere stubbornness.

Chapter 4541: Advance Notice

“Since you refuse, let’s take this one step at a time.” Guan Yu turned to leave.

Xiao Mei called out, “This isn’t irreparable. I can keep her hidden—even leave her behind. But since it’s your people who fear her, I have a condition.”

Guan Yu halted, wary of traps. “What condition?”

If reasonable, he might agree to appease his companions’ fears.

Xiao Mei stepped closer, smiling. “If you promise to stay near me on this journey—avoiding no deliberate distance, granting my reasonable requests—I’ll leave her in the Jiayi Sect.”

Guan Yu stiffened. Accepting would sever ties with Siqi. “Keep her with you. Your terms only bring me strife.” He turned away again.

Xiao Mei shouted after him, “Must you be so petty? I won’t devour you! We’re allies—I mean no harm!”

Had Guan Yu agreed, Xiao Mei would still have refused. She and her sister were rare desert sand serpents, their yellowish hue blending seamlessly with dunes. Having cultivated for centuries, Xiao Mei had attained human form while her sister remained in serpent shape. The Eight-Drum Technique in Miao City demanded her sister’s presence—no training pretext held truth.

Though familiar with the desert, Xiao Mei feared Guan Yu’s prowess. Together, the sisters could safeguard each other. With Guan Yu’s group outnumbering her, she needed her sister’s aid if conflict arose—a serpent’s long-range abilities offsetting her weak close combat skills.

Her earlier proposal had been mere jest. Even if accepted, she’d have defied it. Delaying her sister’s cultivation paled against their mission’s urgency.

“I fear greatly—thus, no compromise remains. We proceed as fate allows.” Guan Yu departed, ignoring further calls. Negotiating with this scheming woman wasted breath.

Since Xiao Mei persisted, Guan Yu addressed his companions pre-departure: “Gather round! I’ve news to prevent unwarranted alarms.”

“What now? You interrupted my nap!” Wang Jun grumbled drowsily.

“You’ll wake fully soon. At noon, we learned Xiao Mei’s younger sister is a giant desert serpent. Some already know Xiao Mei’s demon nature. Her sister, though serpentine, understands speech and poses no threat. Fear not.”

“She’s bringing that snake? I dread serpents! The one we saw earlier?” Aze shuddered at the prospect.

“Even small snakes terrify me,” another disciple admitted.

Despite unease, objections dwindled. “Rest assured, it won’t attack. Its heightened senses may aid us—detecting dangers early, scouting where humans cannot.”

Guan Yu fabricated benefits to ease fears. If perceived as helpful, the serpent’s presence might grow tolerable.

With reluctant acceptance from all, Guan Yu concluded, “Prepare! We depart shortly. Endure hardships ahead.”

Chapter 4542: Futility

As the group assembled, Xiao Mei emerged empty-handed—no pack, no visible serpent. Guan Yu assumed her belongings (and sister) were stowed on camels.

Noting their readiness, Xiao Mei frowned and approached. “Are we departing now?”

Guan Yu nodded. “No delays.”

She shook her head. “Impossible. Look west.” She pointed at the haze-obscured horizon. Guan Yu squinted but saw only sandstorms.

“What do you sense?” he pressed.

“A tempest approaches. We must fortify camp, not travel.”

“A storm? Certain?”

“I’m no liar. Stay or go—I remain.” She retreated to her tent.

Reluctantly, Guan Yu ordered preparations. Xiao Mei’s serpent lineage granted weather sensitivity—he couldn’t ignore her warning.

Inside her tent, Guan Yu demanded confirmation. “This storm—truth?”

Xiao Mei smirked. “Why would I lie? Believe what you will.”

“How do we endure it?”

“Fortify tents, gather所有人. Winds paired with rain bring peril. United, use spells to shield yourselves.”

Guan Yu organized reinforcements—binding tents with ropes, corralling camels, congregating disciples in his largest tent. Though inviting Xiao Mei risked exposing her sister, her desert-born resilience rendered external protection unnecessary. Serpents could burrow to safety if dunes collapsed.

Chapter 4543: No Objections

As winds intensified, Guan Yu double-checked preparations. Siqi accompanied him, though stinging sands made her regret it. Tents lashed together, camels secured, disciples huddled inside—they awaited the tempest.

Xiao Mei’s prediction held: by dusk, torrents would strike. Survival relied on collective magic. Yet Guan Yu knew—for desert serpents, this was merely another storm.
