The head of the Fang family chuckled helplessly and said, “You don’t understand Guan Yu’s capabilities. Don’t underestimate him—he’s extremely shrewd. Not only does he have many skilled fighters around him, but he’s also uncannily prescient. We’ve suffered losses at his hands several times now.”

Seeing that the Poison Widow still looked unconvinced, Fang Su added, “Guan Yu’s greatest weakness is his womanizing. He currently keeps four or five women at his home, all in improper relationships. Auntie, imagine—a high school student raising so many women! Such a man truly has no shame.”

Fang Su’s words aimed to provoke the Poison Widow’s resentment. She harbored lifelong hatred for philandering men, particularly those who stole women. Upon hearing that Guan Yu kept so many women at home, the Poison Widow erupted in fury: “What a bastard! Such men shouldn’t exist in this world! Lecherous scum should have their filthy parts cut off first, then pickled in brine!”

Her outburst startled the Fang father and son. They hadn’t expected such an extreme reaction. The Fang patriarch grew even more fearful—he’d recently been enjoying himself with that Liu Chan girl. Thankfully, his wife remained unaware.

If his affair with Liu Chan were discovered and reported to the Poison Widow... This woman, who had brutally slaughtered her own husband and children, would surely show no mercy to her brother-in-law. The patriarch shuddered at the thought of losing his “treasure.”

He resolved to warn Liu Chan immediately to keep their relationship secret. For now, he’d suppress his urges until the Poison Widow departed.

Fang Su continued fanning the flames: “Exactly! Such scum shouldn’t live to harm more women. I’ve always sympathized with their plight, yet that bastard Guan Yu keeps recruiting more into his home—utterly shameless!”

The Poison Widow declared coldly, “Good. The sooner we eliminate such men, the better. Even if this weren’t about helping you, I’d never spare him once learning of these deeds. Just wait for the show—I’ll never let such trash escape justice.”

Fang Su and his father exchanged covert glances of triumph.

After dinner, Guan Yu decided to visit Ma Tong’s casino for the first time since its opening. Accompanied by Xue Jing, he thought negotiating with Ma Tong might prove beneficial. Though not particularly interested in gambling, he found casual play amusing.

The casino’s rules restricted non-chip holders to the first floor. Only after exchanging for chips could patrons access upper levels. Most visitors played a few hands for fun—exchanging chips cost nothing if they didn’t lose them.

Guan Yu wore casual attire while Xue Jing sported a white half-sleeve shirt and skinny jeans, her face masked. Though attempting anonymity, they still drew occasional recognition.

Despite Luo Bo’s earlier disruption, Bill Lin had sent new troublemakers—veteran Feng family bodyguards who immediately spotted Guan Yu. One hurried to phone in the sighting.

Alerted to Guan Yu’s presence, Bill Lin contacted Fang Su. The Fang household was hosting a banquet for the Poison Widow’s arrival. Seizing the opportunity, Fang Su showed Guan Yu’s photo: “Auntie, our target’s at the casino with a woman. This is him.”

The Poison Widow glanced dismissively at the photo. “This brat? Doesn’t look formidable. I’ll send some subordinates to capture him.”

“Auntie, the woman with him is highly skilled. Don’t underestimate them,” Fang Su cautioned.

“Relax. My people are extraordinary. What if she’s skilled? Doubt my capabilities?” The Poison Widow arched an eyebrow arrogantly.

Fang Su forced a smile. Though skeptical her subordinates could threaten Guan Yu, he held his tongue. Having suffered multiple defeats, he maintained cautious optimism.

At the casino, Guan Yu and Xue Jing approached a massive arcade machine—a six-player fishing game with vivid graphics. Players controlled turrets to shoot digital fish, exchanging captured targets for chips.

Noticing two vacant seats, Guan Yu invited Xue Jing to play. She declined, prioritizing security vigilance. Guan Yu inserted a chip, receiving 100 virtual cannonballs worth ¥1 each. After quick losses, he increased bets, gradually mastering the game’s timing and patterns.

Within half an hour, his ammunition grew from 500 to nearly 2,000—a ¥2,000 profit. Opposite him, a high-roller fired ¥500-per-shot ammunition funded through staff-assisted top-ups. Guan Yu marveled at the casino’s profitability—this single machine could generate tens of thousands nightly.

Compared to Sun Xu’s leather factory barely clearing ¥5 million annually, this operation’s pure profit potential dwarfed traditional industries. No equipment maintenance, minimal staff costs—just endless streams of wealthy patrons losing fortunes.

**Chapter 2,732: Taking a Liking**

As Guan Yu suggested Xue Jing try adjacent seats, two men approached. One muscular in a black tank top, the other a bald, tattooed giant—both leering at Xue Jing.

“Hey sweetie, why the mask in this heat? Show us your face,” the bald one sneered.

His companion added, “With that body and fair neck, you must be gorgeous. Take it off—if we fancy you, you’ll be famous!”

Xue Jing turned away in disgust. “Disappear if you value your lives.”

Guan Yu interjected coldly, “Don’t ruin my mood. Leave now.”

Undeterred, the bald man leered, “She yours, pretty boy? Name your price—we’ll borrow her for a spin.”

When they reached for Xue Jing, she kicked the bald man’s face, leaving a shoe imprint. Both laughed perversely. “Spicy! We like it rough!”

Xue Jing whispered, “They’re targeting us. Let’s leave.”

Guan Yu stood, matching their height. “Take this outside. Don’t disturb others.”

As they moved to leave, the men blocked their path—the confrontation escalating toward inevitable violence.
