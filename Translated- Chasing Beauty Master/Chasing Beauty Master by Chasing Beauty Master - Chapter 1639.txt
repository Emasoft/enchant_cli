A young man in the crowd said coldly, “Master, our cover seems blown. How did they discover our identities? What should we do now?”

“Since our identities have been exposed, we cannot leave any witnesses alive. Only this way can our secrets remain safe,” replied an elderly man beside him. This old man was merely a Protector of the Voracious Hunt Sect, not its Sect Master.

Chapter 4278: Insults

The Voracious Lord had not been seen for countless years, and none in the martial world knew whether he lived or died. The reputation of the Voracious Hunt Sect had mostly faded from the rivers and lakes. That they dispatched an elder to lead this operation today spoke volumes about its importance.

“I’m most curious – who exactly are you, and how do you know so much?” someone from the opposing crowd demanded.

“Who I am matters not,” Guan Yu replied indifferently. “What I wish to know is whether you have the face to show yourselves now that your identities are exposed. Do you still intend to skulk in shadows?”

The compact crossbow in his hand was already primed. Should any opponent step forward and negotiations sour, he would loose a bolt without hesitation – status be damned.

Yet no one emerged. Guan Yu had no intention of wasting precious ammunition on mere foot soldiers. “You’re surely thinking of slaughtering everyone here to preserve your secrecy, yes?” he continued mockingly. “But delusions cloud your minds. With so many of us present, do you truly believe none could escape? Once word spreads that you ambushed Prince Zou and assaulted the Elite Guards, even the Second Prince couldn’t shield you from imperial wrath – let alone the Demon Lord’s attention!”

As Guan Yu spoke, a figure finally emerged from the enemy ranks. Expecting the elderly elder, Guan Yu was surprised to see a youth instead. “Oh?” he sneered. “You send this whelp to parley? Weak in cultivation and tender in years – does the Voracious Hunt Sect lack all competent members? Or do you simply not fear me slaying your messenger?”

His deliberate mention of “Voracious Hunt Sect” caused audible gasps. Apart from the Elite Guards, all present now understood their adversaries’ affiliation. The sect members themselves grew visibly uneasy, their decades of shadowy existence and masked identities suddenly shattered.

“You’re unworthy to address our elders,” the youth retorted haughtily. “My presence here is already a magnanimous concession.”

“Ha!” Guan Yu’s laughter dripped scorn. “A petty sect that’s crawled through the martial world’s gutters for years dares such arrogance? What position do you claim – the Jianghu’s lapdogs? Or the imperial court’s?”

Seeing negotiations hopeless, Guan Yu abandoned courtesy. The enemies’ aggressive stance left no doubt – they would never let Prince Zou escape alive. Though conflict seemed inevitable, he’d hoped to avoid bloodshed through diplomacy. Their belligerence extinguished that possibility.

The sect members floundered under Guan Yu’s verbal onslaught, their clandestine habits ill-suited for open confrontation. “Can’t you produce someone articulate?” Guan Yu pressed. “Is this embarrassment truly your sect’s best? Has the Voracious Hunt Sect fallen to recruiting trash?”

The youth pointed furiously. “Don’t overreach! Who do you think you are? None here shall leave alive!”

“Ridiculous!” Guan Yu scoffed. “The grandest jest I’ve ever heard. Your pathetic sect lacks strength to detain us all. When the Demon Soul Sect’s Left Envoy attacked with elders and protectors, we routed them! What hope have you vermin against us now? Moreover...” He gestured to the Elite Guards. “With imperial protectors at our side, how dare you oppose the royal house? Consider your choices carefully.”

As the enemies faltered, a new figure emerged – an elderly man whose sharp eyes and wrinkled skin betrayed advanced age despite his masked face. “We’ve tracked your every move from Liaozhou City,” the elder stated calmly. “We know your capabilities, yet still intercept you here. Do you truly believe escape possible?”

Guan Yu recognized a seasoned adversary. “You seem marginally competent – likely this whelp’s master?” he probed, noting the elder’s surprise. “Don’t wonder how I know. Let me confess – your sect harbors informants. Your secrets flow freely to me.”

Chapter 4279: Silent Killers

Though bluffing, Guan Yu pressed his advantage. “Your grand display with an elder-led force shows the Second Prince’s resolve against Prince Zou. Pity you encountered me. State your terms – I may yet show mercy.”

The elder remained unmoved. “Surrender Prince Zou and depart peacefully. Otherwise...”

“The Voracious Lord himself might give me pause,” Guan Yu interrupted. “But you?” He signaled Wang Jun, who instantly loosed a crossbow bolt. The projectile pierced the youth’s throat before anyone reacted.

“MY DISCIPLE!” The elder caught the collapsing body as others recoiled. Guan Yu remained cold. “A warning. Withdraw now, or more will fall.”

But blood demanded blood. “KILL THEM ALL!” the bereaved elder roared. As enemies prepared a Meteor Spell, Guan Yu fired his Desert Eagle. The gunshot’s thunderous report froze combatants mid-motion. Though the elder dodged the bullet, it tore through his shoulder.

Chaos erupted. “BLOCK HIS PATH!” the wounded elder screamed as Guan Yu charged, Soulreaper Blade gleaming. A yellow energy wave from his first strike felled frontlines, stunning all witnesses. This display of power – clearly surpassing First-Class尊者 – transformed Guan Yu into an avatar of destruction.

Chapter 4280: Stop Him!

The Elite Guards rallied behind Guan Yu’s onslaught. Though individually weaker, their numbers overwhelmed as Guan Yu carved through enemies like wheat. His revitalized core energy enhanced every movement, turning the Soulreaper Blade into a sanguinary tempest.

“STOP HIM!” became the enemy’s desperate refrain. Yet their frontline sacrifices – likely mercenaries rather than sect members – proved futile. Guan Yu’s blade drank deeply, each strike bolstered by renewed spiritual power. The Voracious Hunt Sect’s ambitions crumbled before this whirlwind of steel and qi, their carefully laid plans undone by one man’s indomitable will.
