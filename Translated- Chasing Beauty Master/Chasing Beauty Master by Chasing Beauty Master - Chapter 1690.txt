Just as Guan Yu was about to leave, a young girl came running up from behind. She appeared to be around ** years old.

The girl wore tattered clothes, her disheveled hair clearly uncombed for days. Her face was smudged with dirt, accentuating her grimy appearance, yet her large, dewy eyes sparkled with life.

“Big brother, could you share one of your roasted sweet potatoes? I’m so hungry,” the girl said, stopping beside Guan Yu and pointing at the sweet potatoes in his hands.

Before Guan Yu could respond, the elderly woman selling the potatoes interjected, “Xiao Yue, don’t bother the gentleman. I still have some here. Wait until they’re ready—I’ll give you one.”

“Take this one—it’s still warm,” Guan Yu said kindly, handing the girl a steaming sweet potato.

“Thank you, big brother!” The girl beamed before skipping away.

The old woman sighed. “Poor child. She’s an orphan but ever so sensible. She visits every few days, and I share whatever leftovers I have. She calls me ‘Grandma,’ you know.”

“She seems clever, though her circumstances have forced her into this life. Your bond is a rare kindness,” Guan Yu remarked quietly.

Giving away a sweet potato was no hardship for the woman—her humble earnings came solely from selling these potatoes. Yet sharing them with Xiao Yue brought her simple joy.

“Xiao Yue knows I struggle,” the woman continued. “She never comes daily—only when truly starving. Sometimes she even helps me with chores. Such a good child.”

Guan Yu smiled wryly. “If you ever need assistance, I’d gladly help.” The woman’s advanced age likely made tasks difficult, and he felt compelled to offer.

“Now that you mention it…” She gestured to a large sack behind her. “Could you help move these potatoes closer to the stove tonight? They’ll freeze otherwise.”

“Of course.” Guan Yu effortlessly lifted the sack into place.

“Thank you! Moving them alone takes me ages,” the woman said gratefully.

Guan Yu waved off her thanks and prepared to leave, discreetly attempting to leave silver behind. But the woman stubbornly refused, insisting her needs were met.

As he departed, Guan Yu glanced back to see a group of small beggars gathering around the woman, each receiving a sweet potato. Unbeknownst to him, she devoted all her earnings to caring for these orphans. Though moved, Guan Yu knew temporary charity couldn’t change their fates. Resigned, he walked on.

**Chapter 4419: A Rare Find**

Intending to return directly, Guan Yu paused at a nearby jewelry shop. Perhaps he could find a gift for Siqi here.

The store bustled with female customers. Shelves displayed not only accessories but also women’s daily necessities—explaining the gender exclusivity. A shopwoman in her thirties approached. “May I help you, sir? Shopping for your wife?”

“A small gift. Do you have anything unique?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Unique? You’ve discerning taste!” She gestured to a display of jewelry boxes. “Would you prefer necklaces, earrings, or bracelets?”

Finding the selection too commonplace, Guan Yu shook his head. “Anything else?”

Noting his fine attire, the shopkeeper brightened. “I do have one exquisite piece, though the price…”

“Cost is no concern if it pleases me.”

She produced a small box containing a thumb-sized jade lion. Carved from translucent emerald-green stone, its intricate details betrayed a master craftsman’s hand.

“A fine piece, but unsuitable for a lady,” Guan Yu mused, setting it down.

“Ah, but this rarity enhances beauty and wards off chills!” the woman pressed. “It’s one-of-a-kind—no replicas exist.”

Despite reservations, Guan Yu’s curiosity piqued. “I’ll take it for myself. Price?”

“One hundred taels.”

Guan Yu’s eyebrows rose—such quality would command fivefold in cities. Suspecting forgery, he inspected it closely before nodding. “Done. But this lion surely has a mate. Where’s its pair?”

“Astute! Legends say a prince commissioned matching lions for his beloved—carved from jade surpassing the imperial seal’s quality. Sadly, only this one reached me.”

**Chapter 4420: A Treasured Gift**

Pleased by Guan Yu’s decisiveness, the shopkeeper grew talkative. “The prince sought to impress history’s greatest beauty. Master artisans labored months on these—each detail flawless.”

Uninterested in folklore, Guan Yu pressed, “Any other rarities?”

“Indeed!” She retrieved another box. “This pendant’s called ‘Golden Blossom.’ Forged from crimson jade with gold inlay—a palace treasure that stunned even royal craftsmen.”

The rose-shaped pendant glowed ruby-red, its gilded edges catching the light. Though barely quail-egg-sized, its perfection captivated Guan Yu. “I’ll take it. Add a chain—something understated.”

As she fetched chains, Guan Yu mused on the name—Golden Blossom. It stirred memories of another Jin Hua from his past, her allure unforgettable. Shaking off nostalgia, he selected a simple cord to accentuate the pendant’s elegance.
