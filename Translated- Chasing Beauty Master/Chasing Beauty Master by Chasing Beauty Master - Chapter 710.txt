The old woman was truly bloodied and battered from her collision. This was a game of who could out-stubborn whom—and Guan Yu proved even more unyielding. Leaning out of the car window, he taunted, “Auntie, why don’t you hit the car a few more times? I’ll give you an extra two hundred yuan per bump. How about it? Five hundred if you smash it hard enough. Go ahead—if the car gets damaged, I’ll cover it myself. No need for you to pay a dime.”

Dazed from her earlier theatrics, the old woman realized she’d met someone unfazed by her antics. Digging into the tattered pockets of her coat, she pulled out a brand-new iPhone and dialed a number. “Dali? I’ve run into some troublemakers here. Get the boys over quick.”

“Holy shit, she’s got a crew?” Guan Yu exchanged a startled glance with Pan Xiaoxia as they eyed the gleaming phone in the woman’s grubby hands. “Fuck, she’s richer than I am! Calling some thug named ‘Dali’? You could summon the King of Hell himself and I wouldn’t flinch. Let’s see who outlasts whom today.”

Though seething, Guan Yu knew laying hands on an elderly woman was out of the question. Better to wait for the police.

Within a minute, a Jinbei van screeched to a halt, disgorging three burly men. The infant in the old woman’s arms wailed incessantly, ignored as she pointed accusingly. “They hit me and refuse to pay! Handle this before the cops arrive!”

Refusing to back down, Guan Yu stepped out, his gaze sweeping over the men. “You’ve picked the wrong mark today. Walk away now if you want to avoid worse trouble—but the auntie stays. She owes me for damaging my car.”

The crone whispered urgently to Dali, “Look at their car—they’re loaded! Don’t let them slip away. My head’s nearly split open from their recklessness!”

Dali nodded. Recognizing the impending clash, Guan Yu sighed—sometimes, delivering cosmic justice fell to him. Without warning, he launched a kick at Dali’s abdomen.

Though Dali’s hulking frame rivaled a wrestler’s, Guan Yu intended only to humble him. Yet as his foot neared its target, Dali’s hand shot out, seizing Guan Yu’s ankle. A dagger flashed in his other hand, arcing toward Guan Yu’s calf.

Pan Xiaoxia gasped from the car—their foe wasn’t to be underestimated. Guan Yu twisted midair, spinning 360 degrees to wrench free before driving a heel upward into Dali’s jaw. The thug staggered back three meters, crashing to the pavement.

“Not bad,” Guan Yu remarked dryly.

Despite his bulk, Dali moved with surprising agility, springing up in a carp flip. Rubbing his jaw, he conceded, “Didn’t expect a master here. We’ll retreat. Let’s go, Ma.”

But Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed on the squalling infant. “Hold on! Auntie here hasn’t settled her debt. Leaving so soon?”

“We’re outmatched,” Dali growled. “What do you want?”

“Compensation. Repairing this ride will cost at least hundreds of thousands. Let’s call it a million—pocket change for folks like you.”

“A million? Dream on! Even if I had it, you’d get nothing! Don’t think your cultivation makes you invincible. All of us together might—”

Distant sirens cut through his bluster. As panic flashed across the thugs’ faces, Dali barked, “Second Brother! Get Ma out of here!”

A scrawny, bearded man nodded, herding the old woman toward the van.

“No one leaves!” Guan Yu flicked up the fallen dagger, sending it lightning-fast into the van’s tire. With a hiss, the vehicle listed sideways.

Guan Yu’s true target became clear—the suspicious infant. As police cars rounded the corner, the crone paled. “What... what do you want?”

“A million yuan. Or the baby. Black market prices for infants must be decent.”

“He’s not worth a million!” she blurted, then froze—her admission hung in the air. The child, snatched from a distracted mother at the mall, was meant to be today’s profit booster. Instead, they’d chosen the worst possible mark.

Dali spat, “Fine, we’re crash-scammers. Name your terms.”

But Guan Yu simply pointed at arriving officers. Bodycam footage confirmed the staged accident. As police hauled the gang away, Guan Yu noted the apartment Pan Xiaoxia parked at—oddly modest for someone driving a Bentley.

“My brother owns this building,” she explained. “Temporary lodging until I settle in A City. Care to stay? Free of charge.” Blushing at her unintended implication, she hurried inside.

The apartment’s opulence stunned Guan Yu—marble floors, gilded fixtures—a hidden palace. “Your family’s in logistics?” he guessed.

“Pan Logistics Group. We touch every shipment in China. This complex? My father bought it for my brother, Pan Taisheng.”

Later, as they sat cross-legged channeling energy to suppress the rogue Yin force in Pan Xiaoxia’s meridians, Guan Yu realized the gravity—this parasitic energy, deliberately implanted by a mysterious monk, was consuming her from within. It would take ten more sessions to fully subdue.

Post-treatment, Pan Xiaoxia’s soaked blouse clung revealingly. Though temptation flickered, Guan Yu averted his eyes. Chivalry had its price—cold showers awaited him tonight.
