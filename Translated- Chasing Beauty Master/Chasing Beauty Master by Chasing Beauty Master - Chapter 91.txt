“Guan Yu, let’s buy a house. Staying in hotels is no good anymore.” These words from Du Xu that morning had dragged Guan Yu from his blankets, rallying all his brothers to hunt for a property. After all, Tian Hao and Luo Cheng were locals—they’d know far better than outsiders like them where to find a place.

Niu Le nodded vigorously at the idea of house-hunting. He loathed being woken at dawn by hotel staff asking if they needed cleaning. Damn it! Who wants their room scrubbed at the crack of dawn?

Within half an hour, they’d zeroed in on a promising listing from a reputable local agency—a three-story villa with private courtyard, fully furnished and recently renovated.

Du Xu’s eyes sparkled as she pored over the brochures and photos, immediately insisting they visit. En route, the agent explained the owner had built it for his wedding, but the bride had eloped with another man. The heartbroken groom couldn’t bear the empty villa and decided to sell.

“That bride must’ve been brainless!” Tian Hao spat, adding under his breath, “I’d never walk away from such a place.”

His father would need to flip thousands of woks to afford this mansion.

“Pfft—ha!” Du Xu, seated nearby, caught his muttering. She collapsed against Guan Yu in laughter, pointing at Tian Hao. “If you want such a husband, I can introduce you!”

The jest flushed Tian Hao’s cheeks crimson, though the young men quickly shrugged it off.

“We’re here,” the agent announced, swaying her curvaceous frame out of the passenger seat. She unlocked the villa gates with practiced elegance.

The group followed her through spacious grounds that could park a dozen BMWs and host banquets beneath twin towering trees—testaments to the owner’s dashed wedding dreams.

When the ornate white door swung open, the chemical tang of fresh paint assaulted Guan Yu’s nostrils, triggering sneezes. Unfazed, Du Xu shoved past the agent to explore, fingertips brushing every surface in delight.

After touring the villa, even Guan Yu nodded approval. At the price inquiry, the agent hesitated before exclaiming, “Thirty million!” Her eyes glazed with commission dreams—this sale would net her six grand this month alone.

“Thirty million?!” Tian Hao gaped at Guan Yu, doubting his friend’s coffers. Du Xu meanwhile beamed puppy-dog eyes, mentally chanting ‘Buy it!’

“Bank transfer acceptable?” Guan Yu asked, amused by Du Xu’s antics.

The agent bobbed her head eagerly.

By 5 PM, after endless bureaucratic hurdles, Guan Yu simmered. Damn China’s glacial paperwork! At least the villa wasn’t buried in some remote forest—that would’ve broken him.

They decided to spend one final night at the hotel before moving. Starving, the men transformed from lounge-lizards to food vultures when dishes arrived.

“Yu-ge, what golden business are you in?” Tian Hao pressed, recalling Guan Yu’s formerly penniless student days. Dropping thirty million without blinking?

“Just lucky,” Guan Yu shrugged.

Niu Le clapped Tian Hao’s shoulder, launching into tales of their post-school adventures. As the stories unfolded, Guan Yu realized how many jaw-dropping feats they’d packed into months—luck so potent it invited envy.

That night, Du Xu bounced across their hotel bed in bear-print nightdress, barefoot and giddy. “We have a home!” she crowed after days of euphoria.

“Enough celebration, senior sister,” Guan Yu chuckled, emerging from the bathroom.

She leapt into his arms. “I knew you’d catch me!” Her trust stemmed from when he’d saved her mid-plunge from suicidal despair.

As she nuzzled against him murmuring “Our home,” Guan Yu inhaled her milky scent. “Yes. Our home.”

But nocturnal proximity tested limits—her sleeping form pressed against him, legs entwined, breath warm on his neck. When his hands wandered, her drowsy protests stayed him. “Next time you tease,” he warned, kissing her brow, “I won’t stop.”

Dawn saw Du Xu dragging him from bed, berating his laziness. At checkout, the manager’s profuse apologies over imagined complaints amused Guan Yu into better humor.

Packed and impatient, Du Xu demanded immediate departure. “Breakfast first,” Guan Yu yawned.

“Eat eat eat! You’re such a pig!” she huffed, then meekly added, “I want soybean milk and fried dough...”

Niu Le volunteered to fetch food, earning Du Xu’s glare when he interrupted her tender moment with Guan Yu. A vibrating phone saved the tension—Feng Xin’s call summoned Guan Yu to Master Feng.

Next morning, Master Feng’s call yanked Guan Yu from carnal dreams. “You neglecting this old man?” the teacher boomed. After hurried apologies, Guan Yu rushed to Diyaya Entertainment City, only to be critiqued for his casual attire.

“You call this presentable?” The master dragged him on a shopping spree, seventh outfit finally passing muster. “Now you look like my disciple!”

Thus groomed, Guan Yu stood ready for whatever society event his master deemed worthy—clueless about the coming storm detailed in Chapter 221: The Turncoat, and Chapter 222: Banquet Preparations.
