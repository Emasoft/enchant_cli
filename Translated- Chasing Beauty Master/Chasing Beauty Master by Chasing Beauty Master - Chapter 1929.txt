“No need to be nervous, all of you. I just have a few questions to ask,” Jiang Yuankai pointed at the man on his left and said, “You first. Did you personally witness the beast within the dark abyss?”

The soldier visibly tensed, shaking his head. “I never saw it, but I heard its cries—terrifying howls that echoed every night. The sound resembled a bull’s bellow!”

“Nonsense! Those were clearly eagle shrieks—piercing and shrill. You must’ve misheard,” another soldier interjected.

“How could I mistake it? I hear that sound nightly, always emanating from the abyss. Impossible to confuse!” the first retorted defiantly.

“Speak one at a time,” Jiang Yuankai waved his hand. “Who among you has laid eyes on this creature?”

“I have!” declared the soldier at the far right. “I nearly became its prey!”

Nodding, Jiang commanded, “Good. Describe it thoroughly—appearance, size, distinguishing features. Leave nothing out.”

“Yes, sir.” The soldier swallowed. “During my night watch, without warning, a scorching gust erupted from the abyss. When I turned, a colossal beast soared forth. Its massive claws lunged at me... The sight froze my blood. I fainted straightaway.”

“Elaborate further. What else did you observe?” Jiang pressed.

“It had at least eight legs—over thirty feet long—like a gigantic ant. But its claws resembled eagle talons, and its forelimbs bore dark metallic spikes that gleamed like weapons. Its entire body glowed crimson, radiating intense heat from afar. The creature’s maw... twin pincers like monstrous shears. Utterly horrifying.”

As the soldier recounted, Jiang Yuankai and Guan Yu exchanged meaningful glances. This creature clearly originated not from their world but the demonic realms—likely spellcasting kin.

Such bizarre accounts were unprecedented. Jiang consulted decades-old records chronicling past demonic incursions—detailed bestiaries describing appearances, behaviors, and arcane abilities. Yet none matched this ant-like monstrosity with avian claws.

“Has anyone witnessed its magical capabilities? How does it attack?” Jiang inquired.

Silence reigned until one soldier ventured, “It flies without wings, swift as lightning. Strikes at night, snatching victims with its claws before retreating to the abyss. Whether it uses spells... we couldn’t tell.”

Dismissing the men, Jiang frowned. The creature’s nocturnal hunts required no magic—raw speed and talons sufficed. Without understanding its true power, they faced dangerous unknowns.

Guan Yu approached. “We waste time. Can we confirm only one beast dwells below?”

For if singular, their combined strength could prevail. But multiple foes would demand greater caution. Jiang shook his head. “Impossible to ascertain. Differing cries suggest multiple entities—or terrified soldiers imagining variations.”

“Then let us wait for nightfall,” Guan proposed. “Ambush it outside rather than risk the unknown depths. Seal the abyss after it emerges.”

“Agreed,” Jiang nodded. “But sealing a twenty-foot chasm? Beyond our means.”

As soldiers withdrew, the trio prepared. Guan Yu instructed Wang Xiaorong in laying magical traps—imbuing gemstones with offensive spells. By dusk, they’d positioned triggerable enchantments around the barren perimeter where floodwaters and the beast’s passage had stripped all vegetation.

“Stay with Ruxue tonight,” Guan told Qiqi. “Your martial skills are still green. Protect her.” Though reluctant, the girl acquiesced.

Jiang ordered his lieutenant: “Guard their tent.” Meanwhile, Guan reviewed his plan. Wang’s spell-gems could unleash stored magic when tripped—crude but effective landmines against the swift foe.

As darkness deepened, unnatural silence smothered the forest. Even insects stilled their chorus. Then—a deep, resonant moan like a bull’s challenge echoed from the abyss.

“It comes,” Wang whispered. The air grew stifling, motionless. Another bellow shook the night, closer now. From the void’s maw, a scorching wind erupted as shadow resolved into monstrous form—
