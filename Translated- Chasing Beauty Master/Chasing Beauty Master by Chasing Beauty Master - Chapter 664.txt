Du Xiaojuan held Ouyang Yihan’s excited little hand and whispered, “I told you there was no need to fear. Even if Guan Yu involves himself in your affairs, how could he let you down? Isn’t it reassuring to stand beside such a man? Why not join us as sisters?”

Seeing Guan Yu effortlessly handle Yu Zhengchun, Ouyang Yihan felt reassured, believing he could resolve the Ouyang family’s crisis. Her spirits lifted, cheeks flushing as she said to Du Xiaojuan, “President Du, it’s strange. You two not only avoid jealousy but are as close as blood sisters. Guan Yu vanished for twenty years, yet you both waited. Does he truly possess such magnetism?”

Du Xiaojuan, sensing Ouyang Yihan’s shifting resolve, leaned closer and murmured, “No woman is selfless in love. But when a man surpasses ordinary excellence, it’s inevitable others will gravitate toward him. Who doesn’t admire heroes? Consider ancient emperors with their three palaces and six courtyards—could any woman claim them alone? And our Guan Yu… well, no single woman could endure him. You’ll understand later. If one were to share his bed alone, she’d fear the nights. His… vigor is overwhelming.”

At twenty, Ouyang Yihan grasped the implication. Crimson-faced, she stammered, “Sister Du! What ‘understanding later’? I don’t want to know…”

Du Xiaojuan giggled. “Calling me ‘sister’ already? You’ve agreed in your heart. Such beauty—even I’m enchanted. Those cheeks, that figure…”

Ouyang Yihan protested with playful indignation. Their conversation, overheard by Guan Yu, amused him. A wife recruiting concubines was rare, yet Ouyang Yihan’s bashful demeanor stirred his interest.

Before today, Ouyang Yihan had merely felt goodwill toward Guan Yu. But witnessing him effortlessly injure a first-class variant human ignited genuine admiration.

Seeking security and aligning with strength were primal instincts. In nature, males compete while females choose the mightiest—a survival imperative beyond morality.

The Ouyang family teetered on ruin. No clan dared aid them. Only Yu Zhengchun offered help, demanding Ouyang Yihan as payment. Prepared to sacrifice herself for her family’s survival, she had resolved to comply then end her life afterward.

In such crises, chastity’s sanctity fades against a clan’s survival.

Yu Zhengchun materialized meters away, face disfigured, cheeks hollow. He spat blood laced with shattered teeth—Guan Yu’s slap had stripped him bare.

Trembling, Yu Zhengchun croaked, “What… are you? Human? Ghost? No ordinary being can defeat a first-class variant human!”

Guan Yu eyed him coldly. “Frog in a well. Your ignorance astounds. Human? Ghost? I am divinity.”

Suddenly, Guan Yu turned toward Y City. “Who approaches—Meng Feilong or Hong Wudi?”

Though Yu Zhengchun had summoned Meng Feilong, the latter’s aura remained undetected. Guan Yu’s prescience confirmed his superiority.

**Chapter 1687: So It’s You**

Meng Feilong’s arrival in Y City served dual purposes: avenging his nephew Meng Fancheng’s injury and aiding Yu Zhengchun’s pressure campaign against the Ouyang family. While Yu Zhengchun lusted after Ouyang Yihan, his true aim was seizing control of her family’s influence. Despite serving the military, he chafed under its yoke, plotting independence through the Ouyangs’ subjugation.

Similarly, Meng Feilong directed his brother Meng Jingang’s expansion in Y City. Recent arrests of Meng’s men by Hou Jinshun and Wang Manqing threatened the Black Dragon Society’s operations, necessitating Meng Feilong’s intervention.

Yu Zhengchun and Meng Feilong, comrades since pre-variant days, now stood among China’s elite first-class variant humans, rivaled only by the elusive Hong Wudi. Their alliance vexed authorities.

Approaching the scene, Meng Feilong frowned. He recognized Ouyang Yihan and vaguely recalled Du Xiaojuan, but Guan Yu’s youth puzzled him. Why would Yu Zhengchun need aid against a mere boyfriend?

Within thirty meters, Meng Feilong froze. Yu Zhengchun’s deformed visage defied reason—their enhanced bodies could withstand vehicles, yet here lay defeat by mere palm strikes.

“Where’s Hong Wudi?” Meng Feilong demanded, twin shortswords gleaming.

Yu Zhengchun paled. “Hong Wudi’s here?”

Meng Feilong’s gaze shifted to Guan Yu. Recognition struck—the youth accompanying Hou Jinshun! Then, noting Du Xiaojuan, he gasped: “Du Xiaojuan? CEO of Huanyu Group?”

Finally, memory ignited. His voice quavered. “You! Guan Yu!”

Yu Zhengchun blinked. “Who’s Guan Yu?”

Ignoring him, Meng Feilong stammered, “You returned from the Divine Ruins? Then your power surpasses all variants!”

The name ‘Guan Yu’ triggered Yu Zhengchun’s recollection. Decades-old propaganda resurfaced—the hero lost to the Divine Ruins’ experiments.

**Chapter 1688: True Power**

Years prior, China glorified Guan Yu to recruit Divine Ruins volunteers. When mortality rates soared, governments turned to hardened criminals. Yet Guan Yu’s legend lingered among survivors like these two.

“Aren’t Divine Ruins entrants dead?” Yu Zhengchun rasped.

Guan Yu smiled. “Had I perished, rogues like you would run unchecked—oppressing the weak, building empires. Criminals masquerading as heroes.”

Bullies crumble before greater strength. Now, the tyrants trembled.

Meng Feilong hid skepticism until Guan Yu asked, “Your forte is speed?”

“None surpass me!” Meng Feilong boasted.

Before the words faded, pain seared his wrist. His sword now rested in Guan Yu’s hand—movement imperceptible.

“Telekinesis?” Meng Feilong frowned.

“Blind fool.” Guan Yu’s blade dissolved midair, vaporizing within breaths. “Your ‘variants’ are pathetic—awakened scraps of potential too meager to kill you. True strength…”

He gestured toward a distant mountaintop. Golden light lanced from his palm. With nuclear fury, the summit vanished—a mushroom cloud etching disbelief.

“This… is power.”
