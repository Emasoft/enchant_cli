After hearing Guan Yu’s words, Ling’er stopped blushing and no longer tugged at Aunt Qing’s sleeve. She wanted to say something but seemed unable to voice it.

**Chapter Two Thousand Two Hundred and Thirty-Nine: Agreement, Agreement**

Guan Yu knew what she wished to say. Since she remained silent, he spoke instead: “I understand Ling’er yearns for a stable life. She needs someone who can provide her with security and protection—not necessarily someone wealthy. I cannot offer her that stability, and my wealth makes me an unsafe choice in her eyes. That’s the truth.”

His words pierced Ling’er’s heart, perfectly aligning with her thoughts. She had imagined being with Guan Yu countless times but always rejected the idea. His immense wealth made her feel insecure.

Moreover, Guan Yu’s dangerous lifestyle troubled her. Though he appeared idle, Ling’er had heard much about his involvement in violent conflicts. At Huaye Club, where she worked, news of the city’s events—big or small—spread faster than the press. Even rumors of Young Master Feng hiring top-tier assassins from the Tian Organization to kill Guan Yu had reached her ears.

Ling’er felt such a man was unsuitable for her. First, she feared becoming a burden to him, leaving him helpless in crises. Second, she worried about her parents’ anxiety. If something happened to Guan Yu now, the Qings would fret over him as a friend. But if he became their son-in-law, their worries would multiply. Ling’er herself would agonize—what if she learned a top-tier assassin targeted him? She’d lie awake night after night.

A filial daughter, Ling’er resolved never to choose a partner who might cause her parents distress. If no suitable man existed, she’d rather remain single forever.

In a soft voice, Ling’er said, “Brother Guan is right. I overthink things, and… I feel unworthy of him. I cherish our current relationship—he as my elder brother, I as his younger sister.”

Shuangshuang, indignant on her behalf, interjected, “Sister Ling’er, if I were you, I’d demand a place by Handsome Brother’s side—with a proper title! You clearly love him. Why torment yourself?”

Shuangshuang’s words struck true. Ling’er’s heart belonged entirely to Guan Yu, aside from her parents. Yet she refused to disrupt their bond or accept more of his kindness, feeling indebted enough to serve as his maid or caretaker.

Seeking to divert the conversation, the clever Ling’er seized on Shuangshuang’s remarks: “Ah, Shuangshuang, have you taken a liking to Brother Guan? Shall I play matchmaker?”

Without hesitation, Shuangshuang declared, “Of course! Handsome Brother is my Prince Charming!” She skipped over to Ling’er. “If you help me win him, I’ll repay you handsomely once we’re together!”

Auntie scolded laughingly, “Enough, Shuangshuang! Have some shame, girl!”

“Why?” Shuangshuang pouted. “I’m grown! The Wang girl behind our house married a year younger than me. Why can’t I pursue love?”

In rural areas, early marriages were common—girls often wed by eighteen, sometimes younger.

Qu Meimei marched up to Guan Yu, pointing at his nose. “Guan Yu! I, Meimei, have set my sights on you. Give me a straight answer—yes or no?” Her comically fierce stance suggested violence if refused.

Guan Yu’s mind raced. A rejection might send Shuangshuang storming out again—she’d only just been coaxed back. After a prolonged silence under everyone’s expectant gazes, he smiled. “This is… complicated. As you know, I already have several women in my life. I adore Shuangshuang, but she’s too young. Don’t you agree?”

Auntie and Uncle remained quiet. Having Guan Yu as their son-in-law would elevate the Qu family’s status. Despite their brief acquaintance, Auntie recognized his integrity and kindness—Shuangshuang would fare well with him.

“So do you agree or not? Stop beating around the bush!” Meimei pressed.

Cornered, Guan Yu glanced pleadingly at Ling’er and Aunt Qing. The former ignored him; the latter advised, “Speak your truth, child. Whatever your answer, we’ll respect it.”

Relenting, Guan Yu said, “Let’s revisit this later. After Auntie’s treatment in the city, Shuangshuang can visit my place frequently. If she adjusts well, she may stay. If not, she’s free to leave.” He hoped time would dampen her feelings.

Misinterpreting his words as acceptance, Shuangshuang threw her arms around Guan Yu and kissed his cheek. “So you agree! Are we engaged now?” Startled, Guan Yu nodded helplessly.

To escape further discussion, Guan Yu feigned exhaustion. “It’s late—shouldn’t we rest? The wine’s making me drowsy.”

Auntie agreed hurriedly. “Yes! Guan Yu must rise early tomorrow to escort Meimei for her wedding.”

Sleeping arrangements proved challenging in the sprawling but sparse Qu residence. Auntie and Uncle took their room, Aunt Qing and Ling’er the inner heated brick bed. Guan Yu was lodged in the western room—a storage space cluttered with boxes and a cramped bed.

Auntie apologized, “Forgive our humble accommodations.”

“Not at all,” Guan Yu assured, though the rock-hard bed promised sleeplessness.

After lights-out, Uncle whispered, “City folks aren’t used to brick beds. But he’s a good lad—we’re lucky he’s helping with Meimei’s wedding.”

“True,” Auntie replied. “Though I panicked accepting his 20,000 yuan wedding gift. We’ll return it when he marries.”

Uncle shuddered. “What if he has multiple weddings? We can’t afford 20,000 each time!”

“We’ll give 20,000 for his first marriage, then modest sums afterward,” Auntie reasoned.

They then debated Shuangshuang’s prospects with Guan Yu, acknowledging his wealth and kindness but worrying about shared affections. Their murmured conversation soon turned amorous, their creaking bed audible to Guan Yu.

Restless, Guan Yu heard Shuangshuang’s whisper: “Handsome Brother… can’t sleep?”

“The bed’s like stone,” he admitted.

“Country life’s harder than city comforts,” she sympathized, reaching to touch his hair. “Join me below? There’s space.”

Noting Meimei’s silent shift to make room, Guan Yu countered, “Why not come up here? We’ll chat.”

Shuangshuang eagerly slipped into his narrow space. “Just talking—no touching!” she giggled, then added, “But I’m your fiancée now!”

As they whispered about her schooling, Guan Yu offered to transfer her to a city institution.

“Wonderful!” Shuangshuang cheered, then hesitated. “But I’d miss my parents terribly…”
