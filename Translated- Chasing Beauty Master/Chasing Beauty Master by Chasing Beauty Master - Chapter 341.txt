“Civilized matters are not handled publicly. This is the opinion of the school’s leadership, who believe Wen Ya is highly likely to be the second prodigy after Gao Wei. If any scandal erupts, it won’t just affect her own development but also damage the school’s reputation.”



“You must understand—a single Gao Wei has already made the school’s name resoundingly famous. If a second prodigy emerges, the school will undoubtedly become a shining star in the education world.”



“Such an opportunity is something the school naturally won’t let slip.”



“This is precisely why Wen Ya was summoned here for questioning instead of being taken directly to the police station.”



“Wen Ya, don’t waste everyone’s time. Honestly confess what happened last night, and you might receive leniency!” Wang Dachui barked sternly.



“But I didn’t do anything—nothing at all!” Wen Ya replied calmly.



“What kind of attitude is this?!” Wang Dachui growled.



“You claim innocence, yet irrefutable evidence lies before us. No amount of denial will help! If you confess now and take responsibility for your mistakes, the school may show mercy in your punishment. Otherwise, once this escalates, you’ll not only ruin your future but also tarnish the school’s reputation. Can you bear those consequences?”



Wang Dachui pressed impatiently, “Don’t tell me you lack motive. I know your family’s circumstances—a low-income household with both parents hospitalized, your mother requiring expensive surgery. With no income, how could you afford their medical bills or continue your studies? At this point, what choice do you have but to resort to deceit? The stolen equipment was worth over 300,000 yuan, and the keys were in your possession. How could you resist?”



Wang Dachui cornered Wen Ya, his words aimed at speeding up the police investigation and quashing any negative fallout.



“You weren’t at the crime scene, and you’re not foolish enough to leave obvious traces. But nowadays, do evildoers need to act personally? I must admire your tactics—throwing up smokescreens? But your attempts to cover up only expose you further!”



“With solid evidence and clear motive, confess to the police now. Don’t waste time or make this unpleasant!” Wang Dachui urged.



Wen Ya’s heart sank.



Tears blurred her vision.



At this moment, she felt utterly helpless—a deep, piercing helplessness!



Whether from wrongful accusations or life’s cruel realities, despair gripped her.



“Just because my family is poor, I’m automatically branded a thief? Is poverty a crime? Should the poor bear blame for others’ mistakes?”



The injustice burned. Poverty had made her a sacrificial lamb, a scapegoat for reality’s cruelties.



“I didn’t steal anything! I’m innocent—framed!” Wen Ya screamed hoarsely, her voice raw with defiance.



Her cry held both anguish and rebellion against an unjust world.



She refused to submit to this twisted reality.



Why must the poor always bear the blame?



It wasn’t fair—profoundly unfair!



But confronting this injustice only deepened her helplessness. The poor’s voices remained insignificant.



“Secretary Wang, I see no need for further caution. Proceed through standard protocols!” Officer Zheng said coldly.



Wang Dachui gritted his teeth. “Then handle it as Officer Zheng suggests!”



Officer Zheng nodded. “Take her away. Let’s see how long she resists at the station!”



As they moved to arrest Wen Ya, a voice rang out: “Not everyone’s as brainless as you fools!”



A figure appeared at the door—Guan Yu.



**Chapter 857: Kowtowing**



Guan Yu’s calm voice struck like thunder. Officer Zheng exploded: “You! Repeat what you said!”



Guan Yu smirked. “I’ve heard of people begging for favors, but begging to be insulted? You’re a brainless imbecile!”



Officer Zheng’s face darkened, fists clenched. “You’re under arrest for insulting officers and obstructing justice!”



“What proof? Did I name you? Or call you an imbecile? If you’re too fat to fit through doors, that’s your problem!” Guan Yu retorted mockingly.



When Officer Zheng grabbed him, Guan Yu flipped him effortlessly. The other officer met the same fate.



“Advocating civilized law enforcement? You’re the violent ones!” Guan Yu scoffed.



Wang Dachui approached nervously. “Mr. Guan, this is a school. Attacking officers is… unwise.”



Guan Yu glared. “You imbecile! You framed Wen Ya without evidence. Why not crown yourself with cuckoldry? You’re unfit to be secretary!”



Wang Dachui groveled. “Yes, Mr. Guan. I’ll ensure justice for Wen Ya.”



“Justice? She’s clearly framed! Use your brain!” Guan Yu roared.



After berating Wang Dachui, Guan宇 secured Wen Ya’s release. As they left, he warned: “Grow a brain!”



**Chapter 858: My Woman**



Outside, Guan Yu confronted Wen Ya. “Let me help find who’s targeting you.”



Wen Ya coldly rebuffed him. “I need no help from you.”



Undeterred, Guan Yu insisted: “You’re in danger. Let me protect you.”



Though resentful over past tensions, Wen Ya reluctantly acknowledged his point. The recent framing proved threats lurked.



“Tell me everything recent. I’ll eliminate any danger to you,” Guan Yu vowed.



Thus began their uneasy alliance against unseen enemies, as Guan Yu resolved to shield Wen Ya from the shadows targeting her.
