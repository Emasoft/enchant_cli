“Not yet. There is another matter—I hope Prince Zou and Your Highness can keep my identity confidential. The name Guan Yu shouldn’t appear in the capital yet,” Guan Yu said. “Recently, the name Wan Hong has gained prominence. I still need this alias for certain plans.”

“Rest assured,” Prince Zou pledged. “I personally guarantee we’ll protect this secret. Not a soul shall hear of it—not even Hongren.”

Guan Yu continued, “By the way, there’s another favor I’d like to ask of Your Highness.”

“Speak freely,” the Crown Prince replied amiably. Having met Guan Yu earlier and heard Prince Zou recount their perilous journey to the capital, the Crown Prince held profound respect for the man. Were it not for Guan Yu, Prince Zou might never have survived the trip.

The Crown Prince now regarded Guan Yu with newfound appreciation, recognizing how invaluable such a capable ally could be—even among brothers.

“Though the imperial city’s lockdown has lifted, merchant caravans still face strict inspections and travel permits,” Guan Yu said with a smile. “Tomorrow, I need to transport construction materials through the gates. Might Your Highness grant them passage?”

The materials for rebuilding the Scarlet Moon Theater awaited outside the walls, with craftsmen already gathered at the site. Despite the eased restrictions, moving large shipments through crowded checkpoints remained challenging.

With the Crown Prince’s intervention, however, the process would smooth considerably.

The Crown Prince agreed cautiously, “I can permit this, but may I ask—what purpose do these materials serve?”

“The Scarlet Moon Theater lies in ruins. I intend to rebuild it grander than before,” Guan Yu explained. “Materials will arrive over several days. Your Highness’s cooperation would be invaluable.”

“Consider it done,” the Crown Prince nodded. “As Prince Zou’s savior, you’ll face no hindrances—this much I owe to his honor.”

Guan Yu smiled gratefully. “My thanks, Your Highness.”

Prince Zou interjected, “I’d heard of the theater’s misfortune. That performer Chu Fan had remarkable talent. A pity about the... accident.”

Guan Yu’s smile turned icy. “Your Highness jests. There are no coincidental accidents—only calculated schemes. Those who disrupt my affairs will reap what they sow.”

“Yet I remain puzzled,” Prince Zou pressed. “Why purchase that theater under the Wan Hong alias? The exorbitant price made waves even in my circles.”

The Crown Prince chuckled. “Come now, Prince—you’re a regular at auctions. Such news couldn’t escape you, especially given your taste for curiosities.”

Laughter filled the room before Guan Yu clarified, “To establish roots here, one needs foundations. The Scarlet Moon Theater is now my foothold in the capital.”

“A shrewd move,” Prince Zou approved. “Though costly, its prime location and reputation instantly elevated Wan Hong’s status among the elite—a strategy I admire.”

The prince sighed ruefully, “I’ve contemplated similar approaches. Despite my title, lacking a proper residence here diminishes my standing. A grand manor would bolster both prestige and influence—much as your theater does.”

Guan Yu nodded, recognizing kindred strategic thinking. In the capital, opulent estates symbolized power—the Four Great Families’ sprawling compounds stood testament to this truth. Without such visible markers of wealth and status, accessing high society remained impossible.

“Had I not acquired the theater or gifted the Eastern Sea Pearl,” Guan Yu mused, “I’d never have crossed paths with Jiang Xin, Duan Ruxue, or Tang Muchen. Even confronting Cao Di and Qu Hua required that standing.”

Prince Zou smiled knowingly. “Your insight cuts deep, Guan Yu. My manor in Liao City suffices, though building here would be simple enough—a choice of modesty over ostentation.”

As Guan Yu prepared to leave, the Crown Prince offered, “Shall I arrange special passage through the gates?”

“Unnecessary.” With a cryptic smile, Guan Yu melted into shadowy corridors before soaring undetected over the city walls.

**Chapter 4919: Stubborn Denials**

“How did he escape?” The Crown Prince marveled later. “The gates are impregnable!”

“Not through earth, but air,” Prince Zou speculated. “His capabilities defy imagination. Let him be—his warnings serve us well.”

Meanwhile, in a secret chamber of the Qin Manor, two figures conversed tensely.

“Why summon me at this hour, Elder Qin?” demanded Lord Cao, masking unease.

The aged Qin patriarch sipped tea deliberately. “These troubled times disrupt sleep, do they not? When imperial wrath hangs over us all...”

Lord Cao feigned concern. “At your advanced age, rest is vital. Let the capital’s uproar resolve itself.”

“Resolve?” Qin’s eyes narrowed. “When suspicion falls on us? Tonight, I dissolve our alliance. The Cao family’s affairs concern me no longer.”

Lord Cao stiffened. “What nonsense is this? What have we done?”

“Need I name it?” Qin leaned closer. “Who else would dare kidnap Princess Jiang Xin? The Eastern Sea’s treasure has blinded you to reason.”

“Slander!” Cao protested. “Even if I coveted the Dragon Pearl, I’d never risk annihilation! This is no mere crime—it’s dynasty-shaking treason!”

Qin pressed relentlessly. “You proposed kidnapping her yourself weeks ago. Now this ‘coincidence’?”

“Loose talk between allies!” Cao countered, the picture of injured innocence. “Would I endanger my clan so rashly? The real culprits are desperate outsiders—like those mobbing the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence!”

Qin’s brow furrowed. “What mob?”

“Two days past,” Cao bluffed smoothly, “vagrants besieged Jiang Yuan’s mansion, demanding the Pearl. You’ve not heard?”

**Chapter 4920: Unthinkable Acts**

Qin’s teacup clattered. This new information complicated matters. Could outsiders truly orchestrate such brazen acts? Yet Cao’s denials rang too practiced, his panic too controlled.

The game of masks continued—each lord guarding secrets deadlier than daggers.
