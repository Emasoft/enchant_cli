Wang Xiaorong first surveyed the surroundings. At that moment, a young gentleman descended the stairs, his features dignified though disheveled, supported by a courtesan whose looks were passably fair.

"Ah, look how attentively that courtesan attends him," Wang Xiaorong remarked. "Truth be told, that gentleman's stature and appearance rival yours. The courtesan beside him is quite comely too. Who'd have thought Echo Pavilion houses such beauties?"

Guan Yu followed her gaze. The gentleman did indeed cut a respectable figure, though his rumpled clothes and alcohol-flushed face betrayed his inebriated state. With numerous guest chambers available for overnight stays, Guan Yu wondered why this drunkard insisted on leaving in such condition.

The man in question was Qin Taijin. As Xiao Zhi was absent and Guan Yu had never met Qin before, recognition proved impossible.

"Steady, Young Master," urged Xiaobao, the courtesan supporting him. "Your carriage awaits outside." Her heart fluttered with hope—having given herself to this wealthy patron today, perhaps her fortunes might change. The vigorous Qin had claimed her at noon, slept briefly, then resumed drinking until evening. Now, as dusk fell, he insisted on returning home despite his stupor, claiming family awaited him.

Their amorous entanglement had been abruptly interrupted when Qin demanded departure. Xiaobao hastily dressed him and summoned the coachman. Thus did Guan Yu encounter the scene upon entering.

"What haste!" Wang Xiaorong tittered. "One would think he's escaping capture, garments half-fastened. No wonder men flock to this den of carnal pleasures."

Guan Yu ignored her barbed commentary, knowing argument served no purpose. "Wasn't it you who insisted on visiting? We can leave if it displeases you."

"Now that we're here, let's enjoy the ambiance." Wang Xiaorong gestured toward a spacious table. "We'll dine before departing."

As they moved to sit, Qin Taijin descended the stairs with Xiaobao's assistance. The drunkard's bleary eyes lit upon Wang Xiaorong. "Well now! Echo Pavilion conceals such rare blossoms?" He leered at her black attire. "This beauty's style differs from the rest—spicy and unique. I approve!"

Mistaking her for a courtesan, Qin addressed Wang Xiaorong directly: "What's your name, pretty thing?"

Wang Xiaorong's aristocratic temper flared. Being accosted before Guan Yu proved intolerable. Guan Yu interposed himself. "Sir, you mistake her identity. She's my companion."

Chapter 3460: Your Blessing

Qin attempted to shove Guan Yu aside but succeeded only in dislodging Xiaobao. Losing support, he crashed to the floor. "Earthquake? Help me up!" he bellowed.

Xiaobao rushed to assist, swallowing resentment. She understood wealthy patrons brought not happiness but gold—and gold solved all. Let men philander; with coin, she could keep lovers of her own.

"Not you!" Qin slapped Xiaobao's hands away, ogling Wang Xiaorong. "I want that beauty's touch!"

Unbeknownst to him, this "beauty" hid thorns. "Speak another insolent word," Wang Xiaorong warned, "and I'll pluck your eyes like grapes!"

Xiaobao intervened hastily: "Forgive him, he's deep in his cups. We'll trouble you no more."

Guan Yu waved dismissal. "Take him away. We'll overlook this drunken folly." Better to avoid commotion that might expose Wang Xiaorong's demonic sect ties.

"Whores putting on airs?" Qin slurred, rising unsteadily. "You're lucky I favor you! Name your price—I'll triple it!"

Wang Xiaorong seethed. Normally, she'd have taught such oafs harsh lessons, but restrained herself for Guan Yu's sake. "Disappear before I forget you're drunk!"

Qin staggered upright, grin widening. "Feisty! I tire of meek women. Your fire excites me!" His hand reached for Wang Xiaorong's chin.

Guan Yu intercepted the groping limb. "Test my patience further," he growled, "and your wealth won't save you from grave consequences."

Wang Xiaorong's anger melted into warmth. How she adored Guan Yu's protective stance—a true man shielding his woman.

"Dare threaten me?" Qin blustered. "Know you who I am?"

Guan Yu scoffed at the drunkard's posturing. To Xiaobao he said, "Remove this fool ere I lose restraint."

"Afraid now, whelp?" Qin jeered. "Scamper off—but leave the girl! She'll drink with me."

Crack! Guan Yu's slap sent Qin reeling, saved from collapse only by Xiaobao. Blood trickled from the dandy's lip. "You struck me? Guards! Seize them!"

His summons brought six burly attendants. Guan Yu assessed them—muscled but mundane. Wang Xiaorong sighed theatrically: "Trouble finds us wherever we go! Can't we ever enjoy peace?"

"Peace?" Guan Yu retorted. "Had you veiled your beauty, we'd not be here! Must you parade your charms?"

"Parade? Should I mask this face?" Wang Xiaorong touched her cheek mockingly. "Wear a face veil like some bandit?"

"Exactly! A scrap of silk might spare us endless—"

"Enough!" Qin roared, interrupting their banter. Twin shouts of "Silence!" cowed him momentarily.

Chapter 3461: Unwise Provocation

Wang Xiaorong planted hands on hips. "A true man shoulders burdens! Must I solve every—"

"Must you bait every lecher?" Guan Yu countered. "If you—"

"Cease this drivel!" Qin interjected. Another dual rebuke silenced him.

Xiaobao shrilled commands: "Surround them! These ruffians assaulted Master Qin!" The guards tightened their circle.

Guan Yu eyed the brutes contemptuously. Were these the best a moneyed fop could muster? Wang Xiaorong's laughter tinkled. "How tedious. Must we always dance this dance?"

"Blame your fatal allure," Guan Yu grumbled. "A simple veil—"

"Never! Let the world admire what's mine to show!" She preened, secretly thrilled by his jealous protectiveness.

Qin gaped at their nonchalance. Where was the cowering fear? The pleading mercy? These two bickered like an old married couple amidst impending violence!

"Enough theatrics!" he spluttered. "You'll—"

"Quiet!" they snapped in unison, reducing him to sputtering silence.

The standoff crystallized—drunken arrogance versus seasoned nonchalance. Guan Yu flexed his fingers, ready to educate these fools on the price of hubris. Wang Xiaorong's eyes glinted, anticipating the coming storm with relish. Let the dance begin.
