Inside the music classroom of the teaching building, Xie Yulu (Rain Dew) lay atop a long rectangular lectern, her face flushed as she panted heavily. Pressed against her was her close girlfriend Xia Jinhua (Golden Flower), the two entangled in a heated moment when Xie Yulu’s phone abruptly rang.

After answering the call, her excitement faded into irritation. “Of all times...” she muttered, reluctantly ending their tryst.

Guan Yu had no clue what schemes were afoot. After Sun Zhi hung up, the crowd behind him parted to reveal Xie Yulu and Xia Jinhua entering arm-in-arm, their intimate display drawing uneasy glances. Guan Yu realized the traitor had revealed herself.

Wei Hongwei had initially been delighted to see these beauties, fellow members of the Yu Gang. But the unexpected soon unfolded.

Spotting Guan Yu, Xie Yulu batted her eyelashes and cooed, “Guan Yu, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to betray you.”

Guan Yu had never taken these two seriously—their loyalty meant little. Unfazed, he watched as Xie Yulu raised her voice: “Enough pretending! Those loyal to me, step forward now!”

Confusion rippled through Wei Hongwei, Jia Bo, Wang Hu, and others. As Xie Yulu finished speaking, sixty to seventy members from Wang Hu’s hundred-strong force shifted to her side.

The truth struck Guan Yu: Xie Yulu had poached his people. He’d assumed her Yu Gang membership was mere amusement, never suspecting her as a mole.

A flicker of surprise crossed Guan Yu’s face. How had this seemingly delicate woman orchestrated such subterfuge? Worse, many defectors were former Wang Hu Gang members.

The numbers now skewed dangerously: Guan Yu retained fewer than fifty, while Sun Zhi’s forces swelled to nearly three hundred.

Though Guan Yu, Xue Jing, and Wang Hu—all supernaturals—remained unafraid, their outnumbered comrades faced certain slaughter if battle commenced.

The coup had unfolded swiftly. Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, Xie Yulu had begun recruiting defectors during his absence after exposing the principal’s crimes. Skillfully evading Wei Hongwei’s surveillance, she’d employed threats, bribes, and seduction to dismantle his ranks.

As the imbalance became clear, students watching from classrooms gripped their desks anxiously. Lü Mei’s palms sweat as she fretted for Guan Yu.

“This is bad! Even Guan Yu can’t fight so many!”

“But he’s always defied odds! Remember when Chen Maosheng’s hundred-strong mob couldn’t touch a hair on his head?”

“True! And Xue Jing and Wang Hu are elite supernaturals. This isn’t over yet!”

Murmurs filled the halls. Guan Yu, Kaihuang Academy’s star pupil, had become a campus idol after successive triumphs. Most students rooted for him now.

From her office window, Liu Shilei (Poetry Bud) arched an eyebrow at the scene below. Yet she remained unworried—such trifles were beneath Guan Yu’s capabilities.

**Chapter 1999: Charge!**

Debates raged among spectators:

“Xue Jing and Wang Hu are top-tier supernaturals. Don’t count them out!”

“Guan Yu’s our legend! He’s beaten worse odds!”

Female students especially adored Guan Yu—not for classic looks, but for his integrity and power. Unlike bullies, he protected the weak, cementing his hero status.

Kaihuang Academy’s largest clash loomed. Excitement crackled as students anticipated Guan Yu’s next miracle.

Sun Zhi, simmering with old grudges, finally snapped: “Guan Yu! Today ends this!”

“Last warning, Sun Zhi,” Guan Yu coldly intoned. “Spare yourself your father’s fate. Beg now, or suffer without mercy later.”

“Arrogant fool!” Sun Zhi roared. “Brothers! Crush him, and Kaihuang is ours! Charge!”

Wang Xiaoqian’s motorcycle squad revved forward first, riders swinging iron rods. Wang Hu and Stone Ox dodged blows, hefting bikes to hurl into the mob, scattering formations.

“Attack!” Three hundred surged.

Guan Yu led the countercharge, each strike felling foes as he carved toward Sun Zhi. He ordered Wang Hu and Wei Yong to shield non-supernaturals Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo. Xue Jing, though lacking her former Ice Goddess powers, wielded twin frost-tipped sticks that paralyzed on contact—a weapon even Guan Yu hadn’t known she possessed.

The Yu Gang remnants employed guerrilla tactics—harassing, retreating, then striking again. Guan Yu noted their cleverness, vowing to promote the strategist later.

Outside, engine roars announced reinforcements—not Jones, but Qian Yunqing (Fortune’s Rise) with Zhouyang Academy supernaturals, including follower Wu Chumei. Wei Hongwei had secretly alerted Qian Yaoyao (Distant Fortune), prompting her brother’s swift aid.

“Break through!” Qian Yunqing shouted, charging to rescue his brother-in-law.

With external pressure easing, Guan Yu advanced over fallen bodies. Facing Wang Xiaoqian—a supernatural barely above mortal—he struck ruthlessly, a kick sending her crashing through two henchmen.

Sun Zhi paled as Guan Yu neared. Neither he nor Xie Yulu anticipated the deafening chants now shaking the campus:

“Guan Yu! Undefeated!”

Students leaned from windows, cheering their champion who’d cleansed the school of tyrannical guards. Even Lü Mei’s class roared support, swelling her pride.

Liu Shilei watched Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s relentless advance. These ordinary youths stood no chance against her protégé.

**Chapter 2000: The Unyielding**

The thunderous chants unnerved Sun Zhi and Xie Yulu. Opposing Guan Yu meant opposing the entire academy.

Panic mounted as Guan Yu felled dozens. Yu Gang guerrillas suffered under enemy weapons but persisted. Desperate to reach Sun Zhi, Guan Yu fought with primal fury—every punch a takedown.

Sun Zhi’s rage peaked. Drawing a military dagger, he feigned retreat before lunging at Guan Yu’s throat.

Guan Yu dodged, counter-kicking Sun’s abdomen. The duel intensified—Sun Zhi’s blade dancing toward vitals, Guan Yu parrying amidst distractions.

“You think you match me?” Guan Yu taunted, a lightning kick sending Sun Zhi airborne. Seizing the dagger, he plunged it into Sun’s thighs—once, twice—before pummeling the defiant leader.

“Finish me…or I’ll return!” Sun Zhi spat through bloodied lips, refusing surrender.

“Halt!” Guan Yu’s roar silenced the battlefield. All eyes turned as Xie Yulu tried slinking away.

Noticing her escape attempt, Guan Yu tightened his grip on the battered Sun Zhi. The crowd held its breath—Kaihuang’s fate hung balanced.
