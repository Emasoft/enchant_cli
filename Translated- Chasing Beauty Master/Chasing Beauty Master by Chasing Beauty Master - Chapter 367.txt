Thus, the platform he desired remained perpetually out of reach.

He had time to wait—but who wouldn’t wish to achieve fame and stretch their wings sooner?

To put it bluntly, this "thousand-li steed" lacked a keen-eyed patron. Yet Guan Yu seemed like a worm in his gut, somehow knowing the deepest cravings of his heart. Chen Lin couldn’t help feeling this man might be the patron he’d been waiting for.

As Chen Lin hesitated, Guan Yu spoke again: “Whether to take this platform lies with you, not me. I’m in no hurry—time is plentiful.”

After these words, Guan Yu reclined comfortably on the sofa, poured himself a glass of red wine, and sipped with evident relish.

Chen Lin stared deeply at Guan Yu, clenched his teeth, then strode forward and sat across from him.

“Shall we discuss cooperation now?” Chen Lin began.

“Heh, that’s precisely why we’re here,” Guan Yu replied lightly.

After a pause, he continued: “If you join me, I can grant you fame, wealth, and glory.”

“I don’t want petty riches,” Chen Lin reminded him.

Guan Yu sniffed and chuckled: “Nor am I one to chase small profits. You can contribute through technical shares—I’ll grant you one percent.”

Chen Lin’s expression tightened. He shook his head resolutely: “I demand thirty percent.”

Guan Yu glanced at him but said nothing, leisurely savoring his wine. Li Xi likewise furrowed her delicate brows, observing Guan Yu’s demeanor in silence.

Their shared silence stemmed from one truth: Chen Lin’s greed.

Thirty percent? Guan Yu had only promised Li Xi ten to twenty percent—and that for her full-time dedication. Yet Chen Lin now demanded thirty. Guan Yu couldn’t help thinking the man deluded himself.

The private room’s atmosphere grew stifling.

This tension, however, hardly troubled Chen Lin. His ambition had always driven away potential patrons.

After a long silence, Guan Yu narrowed his eyes, leaned forward, and said coldly: “Don’t you think you’re overreaching?”

Chen Lin shook his head, spreading his hands with confidence: “In China, energy development and utilization remain uncharted territory. So-called experts are groping in the dark, stumbling at every step. Abroad, however, they possess mature theoretical frameworks and practical experience, surpassing us by generations. To catch up would require investments far exceeding the thirty percent I ask—a fact I’m sure you grasp. Otherwise, why approach me?”

Smiling with pride, he pressed: “So yes, I’ll help—but only for thirty percent. Not a fraction less!”

Guan Yu pondered, then said: “Your reasoning is persuasive. But are you certain you can deliver?”

His gaze sharpened suddenly, burning into Chen Lin with intimidating force.

Chen Lin’s pulse quickened. He hadn’t expected such oppressive authority from a young man. This redefined Guan Yu in his eyes.

Suppressing his unease, Chen Lin smiled confidently: “When all others in China are helpless, I alone offer you hope. Isn’t that worth thirty percent?”

Guan Yu studied him until sweat nearly pooled in Chen Lin’s palms. Why this tension? Was it Guan Yu’s innate aura of command?

Abruptly, Guan Yu laughed: “Do you know what I’m researching? Or who my collaborators are? The military.”

“The military?”

Chen Lin’s eyelids twitched. The term carried sensitive allure. Everyone knew the state’s immense investments in defense. Even a sliver of such projects promised staggering profits.

Guan Yu nodded, radiating confidence that dwarfed Chen Lin’s: “Exactly. Once our product launches, formal military cooperation begins. Then, everything you desire will materialize. Ponder that.”

He lounged back, swirling his wine, leaving Chen Lin to wrestle with the revelation.

Chen Lin’s composure finally cracked. Military collaboration—this explosive prospect stirred him deeply. He wasn’t foolish; he understood what such ties represented. No other suitor offered this.

His internal conflict stretched longer than ever.

Finally, Chen Lin met Guan Yu’s gaze and growled: “Twenty percent—my final offer. Agree, and we proceed. Refuse, and we part here.”

He added: “This is my utmost concession.”

Guan Yu’s smile faded into icy detachment. He shrugged: “Then pay for the wine and get out.”

**Chapter 923: The Negotiation Breaks Down**

Greed has limits. Beyond a threshold, even ambition becomes intolerable. For Guan Yu, no room remained for compromise.

“Pay and leave!” Guan Yu waved impatiently.

He could tolerate ambition—even harness it. But Chen Lin’s demand crossed into covetousness. This wasn’t drive; it was predation. Chen Lin eyed his enterprise like a wolf eyeing prey. Such a man, however talented, could never be trusted.

Chen Lin’s fate was sealed.

The man’s expression darkened. His position grew awkward. Wasn’t negotiation about starting high to carve bargaining space? Yet Guan Yu refused all maneuvering, slamming doors shut.

Worse, Guan Yu hadn’t budged an inch. Chen Lin felt insulted. Was this his fated patron? Doubt gnawed at him.

Yet the cake tempted too fiercely.

Chen Lin remained, glowering: “Are you certain? Nationwide, no one surpasses me in this field. Without me, your project will flounder—costing more time, money, effort. Surely you see this?”

He played his trump card, the same that had never failed.

But Guan Yu cut him off coldly: “I want a loyal dog, not a wolf scheming to bite its master. Whether you’re a wolf-dog or pure predator matters not—you reek of ambition.”

Chen Lin’s face flushed mottled hues. Was this insult or backhanded praise? Instinct said the former.

“Fifteen percent. My final offer,” he ground out, suppressing fury.

Guan Yu eyed him like a fool: “Now I doubt your intellect matches your skill. Forget one percent—take a million yearly salary. Accept and sign now. Refuse, pay and leave.”

His meaning couldn’t be clearer. Yet Chen Lin feigned ignorance, clinging to avarice.

“A million?!”

Chen Lin’s fists clenched. This was beggar’s pay! Other firms offered tens of millions. Guan Yu’s offer spat on his worth.

“A million suffices for annual visits here,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Five percent—my absolute底线 (bottom line).” Chen Lin inhaled sharply, as if making a monumental sacrifice. “My诚意 (sincerity) is shown. Now display yours.”

Truthfully, the military connection had hooked him. He’d pushed for maximum gain, but Guan Yu’s inflexibility forced retreat after retreat. Still, five percent could realize his dreams.

“Talking with idiots wastes breath,” Guan Yu sighed, then snapped: “Our discussion ends here. Leave!”

Chen Lin’s face cycled through hues. Despite his concessions, Guan Yu remained unmoved—infuriating and baffling.

To yield further would surrender all leverage. Deadlock ensued.

As Chen Lin left, he tossed back coldly: “We’ll meet again.”

Though humiliated, he clung to confidence. When Guan Yu faltered and needed him, the tables would turn. Negotiations rarely concluded in one round. This was a battle of endurance.

“Oh, we’ll meet again—soon. By then, you’ll beg for that million,” Guan Yu retorted, smile frosty.

Chen Lin stormed out, slamming the door.

**Chapter 924: Evening Reunion**

Alone with Li Xi, Guan Yu sipped wine and smiled wryly: “Apologies—talks collapsed. Our collaboration may delay. Blame me?”

Li Xi lowered her lids: “You’re the boss. The decision’s yours.”

Guan Yu huffed: “You hold ten percent shares! Can’t dump all responsibility on me.”

Whenever hurdles arose, Li Xi wielded this deflection, leaving Guan Yu floundering. Couldn’t they share burdens?

“I never evade责任 (responsibility) where none exist. Why borrow trouble?” Li Xi met his gaze, eyes luminous.

Guan Yu groaned. Her confidence in his problem-solving irked and impressed him. The woman saw too clearly.

“Life’s tedious!” He slumped back, sighing theatrically.

“Your plan?” Li Xi cut through.

Guan Yu shrugged: “Men like him—rising so young—must have skeletons. Find them. Then he’ll obey utterly.”

Li Xi frowned: “Such secrets aren’t easily uncovered.”

“Man proposes, heaven disposes,” Guan Yu replied cryptically, though his bearing radiated certainty.

Though curious, Li Xi’s nature forbade probing. Guan Yu lit a cigarette, features veiled in smoke, smile inscrutable.

Li Xi studied him silently.

Later, in Kyoto’s western suburbs—an enclave of the wealthy—Chen Lin drove to a clandestine lover’s nest, the taste of defeat still bitter.
