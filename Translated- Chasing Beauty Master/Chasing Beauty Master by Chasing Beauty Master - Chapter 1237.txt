“There couldn’t be a giant snake over a meter thick and dozens of meters long here, right? Or packs of horned wolves? Or that enormous horned monster in the pond?”

Having witnessed such creatures before, Guan Yu had grown utterly immune to beasts. Even if predators appeared, he wouldn’t fear them. Clutching a small knife in his hand, he was confident he could fend off a whole pack of wolves.

And if the wolf pack proved too large, Guan Yu still had a pistol hidden at the small of his back—his secret weapon, a last line of defense known to no one else.

As a martial artist, Guan Yu remained unfazed by the prospect of wild beasts. But Si Qi, being a cultivator, lacked close-combat skills, so her fear was understandable.

Watching Si Qi glance around anxiously with every few steps beside him, Guan Yu saw an opportunity to steal a moment of closeness.

“Sister Si Qi, there’s no need to be afraid,” he said, reaching for her delicate hand. It felt warm, soft, almost boneless to the touch, filling him with quiet bliss. “Even if beasts attack, I’m here to protect you.”

Si Qi stiffened, instinctively trying to pull her hand back, but Guan Yu held firm. “Don’t be scared, Sister Si Qi. I’ve got you.”

Under normal circumstances, such words from anyone else would have made her scoff and kick them away. Few in the Yunqing Sect dared claim they could protect her. Yet when Guan Yu spoke them, she believed him utterly. If danger came, he’d fight it off.

In the moonlight, she studied his tall, handsome profile, a deep sense of safety washing over her. She forgot to retrieve her hand, anchored by the comfort of his grip.

Guan Yu, sensing her acquiescence, felt a spark of hope. At the very least, she didn’t dislike him. Holding her exquisite hand was a pleasure in itself.

The forest stretched endlessly, its edges still unseen. Navigating by instinct alone was challenging even by day, but at night—with no paths to follow—it grew treacherous.

This area was rarely visited, as disciples were forbidden from entering the back mountains without permission. Those with urgent business could take the approved route through Tiger Head Peak, avoiding this detour entirely.

“Sister Si Qi,” Guan Yu asked, “why didn’t you seek the Sect Master’s permission to pass through Tiger Head Peak when you came?”

“That would’ve taken time,” she replied. “I didn’t know where the Sect Master was, and my master insisted I retrieve you quickly. I ran the whole way.”

Guan Yu hadn’t realized her straightforward nature. Her haste made sense—had all gone smoothly, they’d have returned to Convergence Peak by dusk. Yet here they were, stranded after nightfall.

Not that Guan Yu minded. Strolling hand-in-hand with Si Qi through the moonlit woods was its own reward. Suddenly, his sharp eyes caught a flicker of light in the distance. He froze.

**Chapter 3179: Observe and Adapt**

“Sister Si Qi, stay still,” he whispered. “I’ve spotted something.”

“What? Where? Don’t scare me!” she gasped, edging closer.

Guan Yu’s mind raced through possibilities. The light he’d seen—too distant to be an animal’s eyes—resembled a torch or glowing object, briefly flaring before vanishing.

“Why would I joke about this?” he said gravely. “This forest is forbidden to Yunqing disciples, correct? No one should be here.”

“Yes. Trespassing violates sect rules,” Si Qi affirmed. “Punishments are severe.”

“Yet there’s someone ahead.” The light flickered again, confirming his suspicion—someone was using a concealed light source, wary of detection.

“It’s definitely people,” Guan Yu insisted. “Should we hide?”

Si Qi brightened. “Maybe Master sent help since I’m late! Let’s go!”

He held her back. “If it were rescuers, they’d keep their lights open, not hide them. They’re up to something secret.”

Her excitement faded into tension. “Where’s the light? I don’t see it.”

Guan Yu pointed. “Watch that spot closely.”

After moments of squinting, Si Qi huffed, “There’s nothing—oh!” A brief glimmer flashed and died.

“Did you see?” Guan Yu asked. She nodded, transfixed.

“We can either sneak closer or stay hidden and observe.”

Si Qi steeled herself. “Let’s investigate. If they’re outsiders plotting against the sect, we should know.”

They crept forward, mindful of rustling leaves. As they neared, muffled voices emerged, easing Si Qi’s fear of beasts. Yet uncertainty lingered.

Through the gloom, Guan Yu discerned three figures in black, faces masked. One held a staff topped with a luminous pearl the size of an egg, its colors shifting under moonlight—the source of the flashes.

“What a magnificent pearl,” Si Qi murmured, captivated.

Guan Yu’s mind raced. If he could claim it for her jade scepter, the gem would enhance its beauty. The staff itself radiated power, clearly a high-grade magical artifact.

The trio conversed intently—one lecturing, another nodding, the third keeping watch.

“Let’s move closer,” Si Qi urged.

**Chapter 3180: Hurry**

Nodding, Guan Yu inched forward with her. But as they closed in—

“Who’s there?!” the lookout barked. “Show yourselves!”

Guan Yu startled. They’d been silent—how had they been detected?

Si Qi shot him a helpless glance. Resigned, Guan Yu prepared to step out when two figures rose from nearby bushes—Yunqing disciples in black-belted robes.

“Zuokong Peak disciples,” Si Qi whispered, noting their sashes.

The duo—Wang Cai (nicknamed A-Cai) and Wen Ming—had come poaching game, lured by the forest’s abundance. Caught between hunger and fear of punishment, they now faced the intruders.

“This is Yunqing territory!” Wen Ming declared shakily. “Leave at once!”

The staff-bearer sneered. “Brave words, little pup. Run along before you regret it.”

A-Cai tugged Wen Ming’s sleeve, ready to flee, but Wen Ming stood firm. “We must report this to our master!”

“Report?” The man laughed coldly. “You’ll be dead before sunrise.”
