“No one could have imagined that the girl was actually an assassin sent by someone else. There was no indication from her appearance, and Guan Yu had no suspicions either. Such an inconspicuous, unsuspicious girl turned out to be a hired killer—how perilous.

Guan Yu reflected that if assassins could appear so casually, he’d have to stay vigilant around everyone when going out. He felt some relief that Xue Jing wasn’t by his side. Had she been harmed, regret would have been useless.

In the span of a few breaths, Guan Yu and the girl had vanished. The three policemen finally regained their composure. The team leader’s phone rang.

“Hello? Commissioner Song, something terrible has happened,” the captain answered with palpable fear.

“Don’t speak. Listen. Did you arrest someone named Guan Yu?” Commissioner Song demanded through the phone.

“Yes, we did detain a Guan Yu, but—” Before the captain could finish, Commissioner Song interrupted, “You’re blind! How dare you arrest anyone indiscriminately? Release him immediately. I’ll deal with you when you return.”

Already shaken by recent events, the captain now faced pressure from his superior. “Commissioner Song, was it wrong to arrest him? Guan Yu admitted to severely assaulting someone.”

“Admitted your head! Release him now! Are you questioning my orders?” The commissioner’s tone turned icy.

“No, but... Guan Yu has already escaped,” the captain confessed helplessly.

“Escaped? Even better. Consider this matter closed,” Commissioner Song said flatly. Guan Yu’s escape amounted to the same as releasing him. Hearing commotion in the background, he added, “What’s happening there? Traffic jam?”

**Chapter 2391: Your Affairs Are None of My Concern**

“No, but... Guan Yu has already escaped,” the captain repeated weakly.

“Escaped? Even better. Let this end here,” Commissioner Song stated. Though hearing horns blaring, he pressed, “What’s that noise? Another gridlock?”

The captain explained, “It’s complicated. I’ll report in detail when we return.”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu confirmed the assassin girl hadn’t pursued him. Likely sent by the human trafficking ring, he shuddered. A direct attack wouldn’t have frightened him, but this stealthy approach was insidious. Modern assassins wielded firearms indiscriminately—no regard for cultivation levels. A point-blank shot would have been fatal.

Guan Yu had orchestrated his arrest to shake off Xue Jing’s surveillance. By having her escort Shuangshuang home while Yang Conghan arranged his escape, he’d gained freedom. His priority now was visiting Yingzi at Jinyu Zailang’s—a promise long overdue. Xue Jing’s constant presence had thwarted him until this risky gambit.

Recalling the assassin’s appearance, Guan Yu realized she hadn’t been among the original restaurant patrons. She’d infiltrated the crowd, filming and cheering to blend in. Her unassuming demeanor disarmed suspicion. Without the panicked driver swerving, he’d be dead. Narrow spaces left no room to dodge bullets.

Now free, Guan Yu called Yang Conghan. “Conghan, book me the earliest flight to Japan.”

“Why? Taking Xue Jing on vacation?” she teased.

“Vacation? I’m handling business. Don’t tell her.”

“No,” Yang Conghan refused. “The sisters ordered Xue Jing to monitor you. I won’t defy them.”

“You’re my only hope! I escaped specifically for this.”

“So you got arrested to ditch Xue Jing? If the sisters find out I helped—”

“They won’t! Keep it secret. Please!” Guan Yu pleaded before hanging up.

He dared not contact Xue Jing yet—his sisters could force planes to return. Better to notify after reaching Japan. Soon, Yang Conghan’s sleek car arrived.

“Ticket secured?” Guan Yu urged. “Drive me to the airport.”

He texted Xue Jing about meeting friends, ignoring her calls.

“Don’t make this blow up,” Yang Conghan warned. “I can’t face the sisters’ wrath.”

“I’ll take full responsibility. This trip’s necessary.”

“What’s so urgent you can’t bring Xue Jing?”

“Let’s just say... female company complicates things,” Guan Yu smirked.

Yang Conghan sighed. She knew her place, never prying into his affairs.

**Chapter 2392: No Stupid Moves**

“I’m just traveling. Having a woman around cramps my style,” Guan Yu added with a lewd grin.

Yang Conghan shook her head. She focused on her role, unconcerned with his other relationships.

“With so many at home, you still wander. Your flight’s booked, but deny I helped. I won’t become Qiaoyuan District’s public enemy.”

“How soon?”

“Departure in forty minutes. Hurry.”

Guan Yu grinned. Freedom! Beyond leisure, he sought Yingzi regarding the golden dagger—a potential key to breaking seals. Restoring his peak cultivation as a Boundary Sovereign could change everything.

They sped through West Suburb, passing Qiongsi’s territory toward Rose Ridge Airport. The tourist hotspot overflowed with summer visitors, but Guan Yu ignored the scenery.

At the airport, Guan Yu warned, “Don’t reveal my destination. I need time before Xue Jing tracks me.”

“Obviously. I’m not suicidal,” Yang Conghan retorted.

“One last favor...” Guan Yu scratched his head awkwardly. “Lend me money. I rushed out empty-handed.”

Yang Conghan laughed, handing him a bank card. “Password: eight eights. Should suffice.”

Without checking the balance, Guan Yu grinned. “Thanks! Bye!”

After he vanished into the crowd, Yang Conghan drove off. Guan Yu collected his ticket, cleared security, and powered off his phone. Three hours until landing—too late for interference.

Meanwhile, Xue Jing returned to the police station after delivering Shuangshuang. Finding no officers from the restaurant, she wandered until a bearded man challenged her.

“Who are you? What’s your business?”

Startled, Xue Jing turned to face the leering officer. His eyes roved her figure, lingering on her exposed calves. Unaware of the danger, she pressed on—determined to find Guan Yu.
