Feng Xin sat at her desk, pursing her lips slightly. "No need. He has it with him! In my car. Go down and get it!" With that, she picked up the car keys from the desk and tossed them to the man.

Over ten minutes later, Guan Yu found himself being glared into submission by Feng Xin, reluctantly entering the partitioned lounge.

Sitting on the small bed, he changed into the casual outfit Feng Xin had bought him. Twisting his torso experimentally, he emerged with resignation.

"Hmm... not bad." Feng Xin offered rare praise, though her tone seemed more complimentary toward her own discerning taste.

"Where are we going tonight?" Guan Yu asked as he sank back onto the sofa, puzzlement coloring his voice.

"A private gathering. Some celebrity might attend. Doesn't matter – we'll make an appearance and leave." Feng Xin replied without looking up, her focus remaining on the documents before her.

The afternoon passed in Feng Xin's office with Guan Yu meticulously studying a small manual, occasionally gesturing as if practicing techniques with intense concentration.

By seven p.m., twilight veiled the city as Feng Xin drove them toward an upscale leisure club.

"We haven't eaten. Aren't you hungry? Let me treat you." Guan Yu's gaze lingered on roadside barbecue stalls where middle-aged men guzzled beer from massive steins, his stomach growling in response.

"There'll be food there. Such a glutton." Feng Xin's lips curved faintly, a ghost of amusement dancing in her eyes.

Guan Yu sniffed and chuckled.

Entering the club's marble-floored lobby that mirrored constellations of embedded ceiling lights, Feng Xin murmured, "City officials will attend. Ignore their conversations – just accompany me through formalities. We'll leave after dinner." Her wariness toward Guan Yu's troublemaking tendencies remained palpable.

Their entrance hushed the bustling crowd. A paunchy middle-aged man rose with theatrical flourish. "Ah! The Fire Gang's Iron Lady graces us! I knew Miss Xin would honor Liu with her presence!"

"Brother Liu flatters me. Between old acquaintances, why stand on ceremony?" Feng Xin's handshake was glacial as winter steel.

Liu Jun smirked, his gaze lingering before turning to other guests. Guan Yu observed the decor – black marble floors reflecting artfully arranged bamboo accents and trickling water features evoking mountain serenity.

"Secretary Wu – that woman... the Fire Gang's leader they mentioned?" A haughty young man in his mid-twenties swirled his wine glass while appraising Feng Xin from across the room.

"The very same. A frostier beauty you'll never find – nearly thirty and no man's thawed that ice. Interested, Young Master Gu?" The mayor's secretary simpered.

"Conquering such challenges excites me. Arrange an introduction later?"

As the mayor's entourage arrived, tensions simmered through the lavish banquet. Guan Yu's jaw tightened under veiled contempt from powerbrokers, his resolve hardening with each condescending glance.

When the Speedster Gang's Luo Cheng arrived pleading for mercy over unpaid debts, Liu demanded fingers or kidneys as collateral. Guan Yu's intervention came sharp and unexpected:

"This debt – I'll shoulder it."

All eyes snapped to him.

Liu's jowls quivered with suspicion. "The Fire Gang meddles now?"

"My personal choice," Guan Yu countered coolly. "You want money – here's your solution."

Feng Xin's quiet endorsement – "I guarantee it" – hung in the air like drawn steel.

As Luo Cheng stared in confusion at his former quarry turned benefactor, Guan Yu met his gaze steadily. No words were needed – the seeds of rebellion against N City's corrupt power structures had been sown.
