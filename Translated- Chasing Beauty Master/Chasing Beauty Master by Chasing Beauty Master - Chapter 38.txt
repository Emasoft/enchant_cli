“Hmm? What is it?” Despite Gao Wei’s presence, Xu Kai maintained a polite smile, calmly gazing at Guan Yu.

“Your mother… is a woman, right?” Guan Yu blurted out the nonsensical question, leaving everyone stunned.

Xu Kai’s face darkened as he glared at Guan Yu. *Why would he ask such a thing? Did he… tell Gao Wei what I said in the smoking room?*

*He must have! Otherwise, why would Gao Wei be so cold? Damn it—this could ruin me!* Clenching his teeth inwardly, Xu Kai feigned confusion. “What? Are you insulting me?”

“No… you misunderstand. I just wanted to emphasize how great women are. They birth and raise you—don’t look down on them!” Guan Yu replied flatly before scoffing and turning away.

Pale and seething, Xu Kai opened his mouth as if to retort, then angrily shook his arm and stormed off.

“Guan Yu, why did you speak to him like that? What’s going on?”

“Nothing… I just think he’s scheming and has some misogynistic views. Can’t stand it, that’s all.” Guan Yu shrugged casually, offering no further explanation.

Gao Wei, however, frowned slightly and glanced thoughtfully at Xu Kai’s retreating figure.

“Who is he, Weiwei-jie? Didn’t you have a female agent? Why’s this strange man here now?” Du Xiaojuan blinked her large eyes at Gao Wei.

“Oh… he’s Sister Xu’s younger brother. She’s dealing with family matters, and since he just graduated in this field, he’s temporarily filling in for her for a month or two. It’s a way to train him into the company.” Gao Wei explained offhandedly before turning to Guan Yu. “What did he say earlier?”

*She’s sharp.* Guan Yu admired Gao Wei’s perceptiveness, tilting his head toward the smoking room.

“Nothing… enjoy your chat.” Guan Yu smiled and stood up again.

Xu Kai returned to his companions, his face twisted with rage.

“Xiao Kai, what’s wrong?”

“Forget it! That bastard’s targeting me!” Xu Kai snarled, glaring at Guan Yu and the others.

After listening to Xu Kai’s hissed account, his friends scowled at Guan Yu.

“Relax… Aren’t they going out tonight? We’ll teach him a lesson—consider it payback for getting us in to see the star. If we don’t beat him to a pulp, I’ll have wasted all these years in N City!” A lean man with a thin mustache growled.

By the time Guan Yu and Du Xiaojuan left the civic center, evening had fallen. Gao Wei, after finalizing backstage arrangements and disguising herself, met them at the main entrance.

Minutes later, she appeared before them in a pink tracksuit, white sneakers, and a baseball cap, her long hair tied into a casual ponytail.

“Let’s eat first,” Gao Wei said to Du Xiaojuan, ignoring Guan Yu entirely.

Stars naturally carried an air of aloofness. No matter how approachable, they seldom warmed up to indifferent strangers—especially male ones.

Throughout the meal, Guan Yu acted like a silent bodyguard. After paying the bill, he sat back down, sipping tea without a word.

“You paid?” Gao Wei asked in surprise when the waiter informed her.

“Yeah…” Guan Yu smiled mildly. Dining with women, whether friends or lovers, meant men should foot the bill—a principle he upheld even with near-strangers.

Noting Guan Yu’s cheap attire, Gao Wei stifled a laugh. *Is he pretending to be generous?* “Thank you for dinner,” she said wryly.

“Don’t mention it. A bodyguard’s duty,” Guan Yu replied, earning a sudden chuckle and an eye-roll from Gao Wei.

**Chapter 90: Perfect Score at Whac-A-Mole**

The Qinhuai River’s nightscape was breathtaking.

Trailing behind Du Xiaojuan and Gao Wei, Guan Yu quietly accompanied them along the riverbank.

“Look! A Whac-A-Mole game! Let’s try it!” Du Xiaojuan tugged Gao Wei toward a crowded arcade machine.

The game rewarded high scores with plush toys—modest prizes for ten yuan a play. Having frequented such arcades in his hometown, Guan Yu found it trivial.

As Du Xiaojuan and Gao Wei excitedly approached, Guan Yu followed wordlessly.

Parents and children crowded around the machines, laughing as rubber mallets thudded.

“Let’s compete! Who can hit the most?” Du Xiaojuan suggested, gripping her mallet.

Gao Wei adjusted her cap. “You’ll lose.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Sure.”

The game began. Du Xiaojuan clumsily swung with one hand, giggling as she missed most targets. Gao Wei fared better, scoring 600 points.

But Guan Yu’s machine erupted in cheers: “Perfect score! All moles eliminated!”

“How?!” The stall owner gaped. *No one’s ever hit 1000!*

“Try again!” Du Xiaojuan begged.

Smirking, Guan Yu obliged. With preternatural speed, his mallets flew—anticipating every pop-up. Another perfect score.

The crowd buzzed. “Husband, try it! He’s amazing!”

Guan Yu claimed two giant plushies—a bear for Gao Wei and a doll for Du Xiaojuan.

“For me?” Gao Wei pointed at herself, amused.

“Unless you want me carrying a teddy?” Guan Yu retorted.

Rolling her eyes, Gao Wei hugged the bear, her elegance magnified by the whimsical contrast.

**Chapter 91: A Beauty to Topple Kingdoms**

By the river, Gao Wei leaned against a railing, chin resting on her plush bear. The streetlights haloed her silhouette—a peerless Eastern beauty whose elegance could topple cities and kingdoms. Even Guan Yu stole glances, heart fluttering.

As silence settled, Du Xiaojuan’s phone rang. She paled, frantically signaling for quiet.

“What’s wrong?” Guan Yu frowned.

But Du Xiaojuan’s panicked whisper drowned in the river’s murmur.
