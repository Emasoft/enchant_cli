After speaking, Guan Yu’s hand suddenly materialized a dark-blue luminous blade—an enhanced version of his *Condensing Qi into Blades* technique, now capable of channeling sixty percent of his power! This meant he could concentrate six-tenths of his total cultivation into his palm, transforming it into a razor-sharp sword that shot toward his opponent! Compared to other techniques, this move was swift and straightforward, yet demanded immense control and mental fortitude. Fortunately, Guan Yu met these exacting requirements, which was why he favored this technique above all others.

***

“What kind of move is this? A Mysterious Tier technique?” At the sight of the dark-blue blade, Locke nearly spat blood, pointing at Guan Yu and shouting, “You insolent brat! You dare challenge me with a Mysterious Tier technique? Are you truly courting death? Know this—I will show no mercy. Prepare yourself!”

As he spoke, a purple net unfurled from Locke’s palm. Upon closer inspection, each mesh was woven from silver needles—no ordinary ones, but venom-coated spikes.

“Heavens! Locke’s truly intent on killing him! He’s using *Rain of Poisoned Silver Needles* right from the start! This move’s forbidden even in training, yet he deploys it in a duel!”

“Exactly! But the gap between this Dragon Clan youth and Locke is too vast. I bet he’ll collapse after this single strike!”

“Ugh, what a waste! I just placed a bet on him, and now he pulls out some unheard-of Mysterious Tier technique. Ridiculous!”

Faced with the onslaught of thousands of venomous needles, Guan Yu froze momentarily. *So Locke’s hatred runs this deep? He wants me dead at all costs.* He tried to dodge, but the needles shifted with his movements. Snorting coldly, Guan Yu retorted, “Hmph! Since you’ve shown no mercy, little bastard, don’t blame me for retaliating in kind. I’ll make you savor your own ‘finest move’!”

To everyone’s shock, Guan Yu suddenly charged straight at Locke. Common sense dictated evasion, yet here he was, rushing headlong toward his attacker. *Is he suicidal?*

Locke blinked in surprise but quickly regained composure. His *Rain of Poisoned Silver Needles* shared a trait with Wei Buqun’s Obsidian Sword—both relied on spiritual energy to control weapons and track targets.

Seeing Guan Yu closing in, Locke had no choice but to retract his attack. Continuing would harm them both—a risk he couldn’t take.

Undeterred, Guan Yu pressed forward. At the last moment, he leaped, driving both feet into Locke’s chest while unleashing his long-prepared *Condensing Qi into Blades* strike. The force of the blow propelled him backward into a midair flip.

Locke staggered but steadied himself, his face darkening. Moments ago, he’d boasted of defeating Guan Yu in one move. Now, not only had he failed, but he’d nearly been toppled himself.

The crowd stared, stunned. The seemingly frail Guan Yu had not only held his ground but gained the upper hand.

“How did he do that? It defies all logic!”

“Ahem! Since when must martial arts adhere to ‘logic’? Any technique that fells an opponent is valid. Why cling to conventions?”

As the spectators debated, those supporting Guan Yu exhaled in relief, as though a boulder had lifted from their hearts. Yet they remained wary—Guan Yu’s momentary advantage stemmed from unpredictability. What followed would be far harder.

“Daddy, can Brother Guan Yu win?” Amy stood beside Elder Allen, tiny hands clutching her dress hem anxiously.

Elder Allen sighed softly. “Young Master Guan Yu isn’t without hope, but the odds are slim… unless he possesses hidden aces we’ve yet to see.”

Amy’s worry deepened. Though Guan Yu had surprised her repeatedly, his opponent was Locke—the Elven Clan’s greatest genius in centuries. Could he truly overcome such a prodigy?

Landing gracefully, Guan Yu adjusted his robes and grinned at the seething Locke. “I told you—I’m not the same Guan Yu. You’ll regret sparing me before.”

“I already do. But know this—I never repeat mistakes.”

“Since you insist,” Guan Yu sneered, “I’ll grant your wish. Your death will erase all regrets.”

“Insolent fool!” Locke spat. “You think a cheap trick gives you the right to boast? Laughable! I’ll show you the insurmountable gulf between us!”

With that, Locke withdrew a thumb-sized gem from his spatial ring. Though unremarkable at first glance, its appearance triggered gasps: “Is that… a Magic Stone?”

“Gods! Locke’s using a Magic Stone here? Has he gone mad?”

Guan Yu frowned. Having spent months in the Elven Forest, he’d never heard of Magic Stones. *What makes this rock special?*

Before he could ponder further, Locke swallowed the stone and began chanting unintelligible incantations, one finger aimed at Guan Yu. Elder Allen shouted, “Brother Guan Yu! Evade!”

Though detecting no visible threat, Guan Yu trusted the elder’s warning and sprang aside, cursing, “Did that bastard swallow another enhancement pill? Doesn’t he know the side effects?”

A thunderous rumble answered him. All eyes turned skyward as a dark shape emerged from the western horizon—a colossal bird, likely a magical beast.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. *So he’s summoning a familiar? He’s pulling out all stops.*

“Unfair!” someone protested from below. “Guan Yu fights barehanded! How can you summon a beast?”

The crowd murmured agreement—until Locke’s avian monster swooped into the crowd, seizing the protester in its beak. The man’s screams ended abruptly with a sickening *crunch* as the beast severed him midair.

Horrified silence followed. Even Locke’s supporters recoiled. “How vile! To slaughter kin like this!”

“We must never let Locke become chief! He’ll doom our clan!”

Yet none dared speak loudly now. The grisly display had silenced dissent.

Watching Locke’s descent into madness, Elder Allen grew more resolute. *He must not lead.* But the duel’s three-round format favored Locke. With Guan Yu now facing both Locke and an Earth Tier beast, victory seemed impossible.

Locke scoffed at Guan Yu’s challenge. “Fairness? How naive! If you’ve no familiar, that’s your failing—not mine!”

His words stung. In Blue Beauty Continent, only true masters could subdue magical beasts. Contracting one required not just strength but a Magic Stone matching the beast’s tier. Locke’s purple stone marked his avian as Earth Tier—a pricey investment, as such stones sold for 100,000 gold coins.

Now circling overhead, the Ancestral Beast’s power rivaled Locke’s own. To most, Guan Yu might as well fight two grand mages.

**Chapter 1348: Beast Battle**

Infuriated, Guan Yu glared at the crowd. *Think I’ve no familiar?* “Amy!” he called. “Come here!”

The girl hurried over, clutching a cat. “Brother Guan Yu… if it’s too dangerous, forfeit! We’ll find another way—”

Guan Yu smiled, cutting her off. “Have faith! When have I ever lost? Even if I did, it won’t be to *him*—my reputation’s at stake!”

He gestured to the cat. “You! Quit lazing about!”

Reluctantly, the cat—Bika—leaped onto Guan Yu’s shoulder.

“Go on, Amy. Prepare to be amazed!”

As Amy retreated, a voice murmured, “That cat…”

She turned to see Roxie approaching. “Sister Roxie! You’re here!”

“I… finished my tasks.” Roxie’s eyes never left the arena. “Can he win?”

Amy forced optimism. “He promised! Let’s pray for him.”

Nodding, Roxie whispered inwardly, *Please be safe. This isn’t your fight… If only we’d never met in the forest…*

Onstage, Locke burst into derisive laughter. “What’s this? Jealous of my beast, so you grab a stray cat? Pathetic! No familiar? Then fight alone! Must you embarrass yourself?”

The crowd jeered. Locke’s Ancestral Beast loomed menacingly—a winged titan from ancient lineages. Guan Yu’s “familiar” was a fluffy kitten.

Bika bristled silently, restrained only by Guan Yu’s order not to speak.

“Enough yapping!” Guan Yu snapped. “Let’s fight!”

“Die, brat! Ancestral Beast—ATTACK!”

At Locke’s command, the beast dove, talons aimed for Guan Yu’s skull. To everyone’s astonishment, Guan Yu stood motionless—until the last second.

With a deft step back, he hurled Bika upward. The cat landed squarely on the beast’s head.

Startled, the Ancestral Beast aborted its strike, spiraling skyward while shaking violently.

“Shake it off!” Locke roared. “Crush that vermin!”

Obediently, the beast ascended, thrashing wildly. Spectators craned their necks, certain Bika would plummet to its death.

Three minutes passed. The beast’s movements slowed.

Locke smirked. “Fool! A stray cat against an Earth Tier beast? You’re delusional!”
