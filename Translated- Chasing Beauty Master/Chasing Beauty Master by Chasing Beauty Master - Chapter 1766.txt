The little girl replied cheerfully, “Just call me Xiao Hei (Little Black), sister. That’s what everyone calls me.” The name sounded rather unremarkable—passable for a young boy, but decidedly rustic for a girl.

To Guan Yu’s ears, such a name would be akin to naming a dog in Huaxia, utterly unfit for a human.

The group pressed onward, finally reaching the mountain summit after an arduous climb. The peak soared high, its pathless slopes choked with dense trees and scattered remnants of vegetation ravaged by animals.

Upon arriving at the summit, they had hoped to behold the panoramic vista of Miao City below. Instead, they were met with thicker haze, reducing visibility to a frustrating blur.

“Xiao Hei—such a distinctive name,” Siqi remarked before asking, “Since you’ve cultivated for centuries to assume human form, you must be formidable. But tell me—are there other animals in Miao City ahead?”

“Of course not,” Xiao Hei answered with a faint smile. “Only yaoren—those who’ve transformed into human guise—may descend this mountain and enter Miao City. I was fortunate, mastering human form after four centuries of cultivation. Some linger here for millennia, still trapped on these slopes.”

Her words left the group perplexed. So Miao City permitted entry solely to yaoren who had achieved human transformation, while ordinary beasts and lesser creatures were confined to the mountains or outer wilderness?

Evidently, this was an ironclad rule. The yaoren within Miao City wielded formidable cultivation, easily expelling or slaughtering any unworthy intruders from the mountains. Resistance was futile against their superior power.

Though brimming with unanswered questions, Guan Yu knew Xiao Hei wouldn’t volunteer information unprompted. Steady inquiry was necessary.

A Zhenyang Sect elder interjected, “We’ve reached the summit. How should we proceed? If Miao City is impassable, perhaps we should skirt along the ridge.”

Guan Yu suggested resting first. “Let’s pause here. The climb has exhausted everyone.”

Siqi pressed Xiao Hei, “So only transformed yaoren may enter Miao City, while others must cultivate here until achieving human form?”

“Exactly,” Xiao Hei confirmed. “Miao City’s central district is reserved for the mightiest. Lesser creatures begin at the fringes, surviving where they won’t be harassed or killed.”

“I see. Gaining entry must be a great honor,” Siqi mused. “But you mentioned we can’t traverse Miao City to reach the flower sea. What path do you recommend?”

“Since the big brother shared his sugar cakes,” Xiao Hei chirped, “I’ll guide you! Circumventing the city would require a massive detour, but I can lead you along its edge. Follow me!”

She bounded ahead, visibly exhilarated. Guan Yu now grasped Miao City’s structure: a human-like metropolis at the core, encircled by concentric rings of ascending cultivation tiers.

The outermost ring housed low-level beasts and fledgling cultivators. As they advanced inward, creatures honed their skills until reaching the mountainside—the final threshold before human transformation. Only then could they descend into Miao City, the ultimate aspiration for all cultivating beasts.

**Chapter 4621: Reunion**

As Xiao Hei led them through lush, undisturbed vegetation on the city-facing slope, Guan Yu realized Miao City lay nestled within a mountainous basin—a natural barrier only crossable after achieving human form.

The tranquil city-side starkly contrasted the beast-ridden outer slopes. Countless creatures yearned to enter, envying yaoren like Xiao Hei who strode freely into the urban heart.

Guan Yu grew tense. Any encounter here would involve powerful adversaries, unlike the manageable beasts outside. Combat prowess varied wildly—a rabbit yaoren might outpace a wolf in transformation yet remain weaker in raw strength. Cultivation duration and innate talent created unpredictable hierarchies, as seen when a pheasant had routed a white tiger earlier.

Nearing the foothills, Guan Yu suddenly stiffened. “Someone’s ahead.”

“Guan Yu! Is that you?” A lean figure emerged from behind a tree—Wang Jun, who had fled Miao City after a terrifying encounter.

Xiao Hei gaped at the newcomer. “How did this little brat get here?”

Wang Jun eyed the yaoren warily as Guan Yu rushed forward. “Thank heavens you’re safe! We’ve been separated from five others.”

The Zhenyang elder asked if Wang Jun had seen their missing comrades. “Just me,” he sighed. “I stumbled into Miao City and nearly died of fright. It’s crawling with powerful yaoren.”

**Chapter 4622: A Marvel**

As the group descended, Wang Jun warned, “Prepare to be shocked. When I first saw Miao City, I thought I’d returned to Huaxia.”

He gestured ahead. Through thinning haze, buildings materialized—concrete structures with glass windows, eerily mirroring modern architecture. Paved roads crisscrossed the settlement, though devoid of electricity or vehicles.

“Incredible,” Guan Yu murmured. Though lacking modern amenities, Miao City’s sophistication surpassed anything in Jianghu. The yaoren had replicated human civilization with uncanny precision.

“Our time’s limited,” Guan Yu urged. “We must reach the flower mountains beyond. The ‘fragrant winds’ from the divine stone mountain likely originate there.”

Wang Jun agreed. “Miao City’s encircled by these peaks. Only flight or grueling climbs bypass them. We’ve come this far—we can’t turn back empty-handed.”

As they traversed the urban fringe, Guan Yu marveled at the paradox—a replica of home, yet inhabited by beings both familiar and utterly alien. Every step deepened his resolve: the secrets ahead were worth any peril.
