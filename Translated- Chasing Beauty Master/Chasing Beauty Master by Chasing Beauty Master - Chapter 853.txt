Bi’er Lin, who had always been indulgent and arrogant, acted entirely on his whims without ever considering the consequences. Yet when he last demanded Feng Xihu (West Lake) to come at his call, Bi’er He had fiercely reprimanded him. In all his years growing up, Bi’er He had never once scolded Bi’er Lin, nor even raised his voice at him.

Having been pampered since childhood, Bi’er Lin would never yield easily. His agreement to assist the Feng family was primarily driven by his desire for Feng Xihu. Though raised surrounded by beauties, Bi’er Lin found himself utterly captivated the moment he laid eyes on her. Her image burned itself into his mind.

He never imagined a woman so perfectly suited to his tastes could exist—as if painted into reality. From that day onward, Bi’er Lin muttered in his dreams: “Women from Huaxia truly are incomparable.”

Now, Bi’er Lin reasoned that even if Feng Xihu discovered his transgressions after sobering up, the Feng family would dare not retaliate. At worst, Bi’er He might berate him again. Compared to the prize of claiming Feng Xihu, enduring a scolding seemed trivial.

His scheme succeeded. The Feng family remained oblivious to his intentions toward Feng Xihu. Though the West Tower appeared heavily guarded from the outside, he found it empty upon entering.

This was Bi’er Lin’s first time inside the West Tower. To maintain his gentlemanly facade, he had never ventured in before. Despite his noble upbringing, the eccentric decor astonished him—the main hall resembled a lavish bedroom.

The circular bed at the center exuded sensuality, while floral photographs adorned the walls, transforming the space into a blossoming sea.

Rushing to the second floor, Bi’er Lin rubbed his hands eagerly. As he reached for the door, a voice startled him: “Who’s there?”

The female voice nearly startled him out of his aroused state. Whirling around, he found a housemaid.

She had been cleaning downstairs and initially ignored the intruder, assuming it none of her concern. But witnessing his furtive ascent to the forbidden second floor, she grew suspicious.

As the Feng family’s longtime housemaid—one who had served Eldest Miss Feng for over two years—she knew the second floor was strictly off-limits to all except Feng Xihu herself.

Recognizing Bi’er Lin upon his turn, she asked, “Young Master Bi’er Li, what are you doing here?”

**Chapter 2202: Unclear and Ambiguous**

Though merely a housemaid, she belonged to the Feng household. Bi’er Lin feared she might expose him. Murder crossed his mind, but the ensuing chaos dissuaded him.

“Oh, nothing,” he said with practiced courtesy. “I heard Miss Feng returned intoxicated and came to check on her.”

“But… the second floor is forbidden,” the maid hesitated. “No one, not even family members, may ascend.”

“Rest assured, my intentions are pure. Miss Feng won’t object,” Bi’er Lin asserted solemnly. Convinced by his status as the Feng family’s honored guest, the maid relented.

“Very well. Proceed,” she said, resuming her work.

Bi’er Lin hadn’t anticipated the maid’s presence. To eliminate witnesses, he ordered, “Tidy my room, launder my clothes, and replace my bedsheets. Now.”

The maid complied promptly. Seizing his chance, Bi’er Lin scurried into Feng Xihu’s room like a frenzied monkey.

The unlocked door revealed Feng Xihu sprawled on a vast quilt, her gentle breaths audible in the silent room. Bi’er Lin yanked the covers away.

Though still clothed, her alluring posture overwhelmed him. Stripping hastily, he froze as commotion erupted outside.

**Chapter 2203: Will Not Succeed**

Feng Xihu awoke to the noise, squinting until her vision cleared. Spotting the two men at her doorway, she screamed: “Get out!”

A barrage of objects—phones, wallets, pillows—rained down, driving the men downstairs. Still tipsy, Feng Xihu staggered to the landing and roared: “Who permitted you here?!”

“Sister, let me explain—” Young Master Feng began.

“Silence!” she thundered. “You know my rules! Get out!”

Her deafening shriek sent both men fleeing to the East Tower’s hall. There, Young Master Feng seethed but restrained himself—the Bi’er family’s support against Guan Yu remained crucial.

“You could’ve courted her properly,” he admonished. “Had you succeeded today, it would’ve doomed our family!”

Bi’er Lin dismissed the warning, resenting the interrupted tryst. “Spare me the lecture. You ruined my plans!” He stormed off.

Young Master Feng considered informing Bi’er He but hesitated. His shrewd subordinate A’qing cautioned: “Angering Bi’er Lin risks losing his aid against Guan Yu.”

Acknowledging this, Young Master Feng promoted A’qing to chief bodyguard.

**Chapter 2204: Prepared**

When asked his tenure, A’qing answered vaguely: “Half a year, Young Master.”

“Prove yourself loyal, and prosperity awaits,” Young Master Feng promised.

“I won’t disappoint you,” A’qing bowed, hiding a calculating gleam.
