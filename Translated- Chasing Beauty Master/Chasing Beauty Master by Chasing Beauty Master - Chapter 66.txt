“Brother Yu, with your luck, if you went out gambling, you’d wipe everyone out! You’re the Gambling Sage!” One of Luo Cheng’s underlings rubbed his hands together, exclaiming in awe.

Guan Yu froze for a moment, staring at Luo Cheng in stunned silence.

The idea suddenly struck him. With his clairvoyant ability, gambling could indeed yield massive profits. After all, seeing every card in play meant guaranteed victories and no losses.

“Gambling’s no good… Xiao Qi (Little Seven), don’t learn such nonsense. None of you are allowed to gamble, understand?” Mother Luo, sitting on the hospital bed, had been watching them with a smile until now. Hearing the suggestion, she immediately chastised them.

Luo Cheng and his friends hunched their shoulders, exchanging sheepish grins before winking at Guan Yu.

Yet their casual remark had inadvertently shown Guan Yu a path forward.

“Hey, what kinds of games do people play out there?” Guan Yu leaned toward Luo Cheng and whispered. Though he’d once run with local troublemakers, he’d never witnessed high-stakes gambling among the wealthy. His former circle had lacked such figures.

With over 800,000 yuan in hand, Guan Yu needed to leverage this capital for greater gains. Petty bets of tens of yuan wouldn’t suffice—he might as well buy lottery tickets otherwise.

“You’re serious about this?” Luo Cheng eyed him skeptically, muttering under his breath.

Guan Yu pressed his lips together and nodded.

“High-Low Draw, Fight the Landlord, Gold Flower—all sorts.” Luo Cheng fanned out the deck, plucking a card to demonstrate. “Simple rules: tens are highest, face cards count as ones. Your eight beats my five.”

The game’s simplicity relied purely on luck. With bets of 1,000 yuan per round, fortunes could swing by millions within hours. This was true gambling.

“Tell me more about the other games.” Guan Yu pointed at the cards, eyes gleaming.

Though puzzled, Luo Cheng noticed Guan Yu’s unnerving winning streak and growing interest. He began explaining each variation, but Guan Yu triumphed effortlessly every time.

The onlookers grew increasingly astounded. Luck might explain a few wins, but Guan Yu’s relentless dominance defied chance.

“Brother Yu… have you trained in gambling?” Luo Cheng asked cautiously.

Cheating in underground rings carried severe penalties—finger amputations, regardless of status.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Just luck. You dealt the cards. I didn’t even touch some of them.”

Luo Cheng frowned, more baffled than ever.

Grinning, Guan Yu leaned closer. “Know any good spots? Let’s test this out.”

Luo Cheng’s eyes lit up. After a furtive glance at his mother, he nodded firmly.

Guan Yu’s streak could mean massive earnings.

“I’ll make calls. When do you want to go?”

“Now. Fast as possible.”

Thus, Guan Yu’s moneymaking plan took its first step.

Outside the ward, Luo Cheng phoned an acquaintance. After pleasantries, he cut to the chase:

“No issue if he’s got cash. Bring him to Luofu Hotel’s lobby. Call me then.”

“Any games running now?”

“A few real estate tycoons are playing. Minimum stakes around a million per day. Your friend up for it?”

Overhearing, Guan Yu nodded decisively.

“Done. See you soon, Fourth Brother.”

Hanging up, Luo Cheng explained, “Bao Si (Fourth Brother) runs bus lines and has connections. His games are safe and clean.”

“Perfect. Wait here or come withdraw cash?” Guan Yu pressed.

Though not a formal casino, these high-roller games operated similarly, skimming profits from each pot. For the wealthy, security and discretion mattered most—ideal for Guan Yu’s plans.

Turning to Niu Le and Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu grinned. “Let’s hit the bank. Time to strike gold.”

Du Xiaojuan trailed silently behind, while Niu Le hefted a canvas bag stuffed with 800,000 yuan.

At the bank, withdrawals proceeded smoothly. They repacked the cash into a bulging satchel and hailed a taxi back to the hotel.

Bao Si, a pockmarked man exuding crude opulence, greeted them skeptically. “This your ‘big boss’?” He snorted at Guan Yu’s youthful appearance.

Luo Cheng shrugged. “Money talks. Let us play.”

In the suite, middle-aged tycoons eyed the newcomers like children at a brothel.

“Since when do kids join?” a bald man sneered around his cigarette.

Ignoring them, Guan Yu took a seat as Niu Le unpacked stacks of cash. The men chuckled at the modest sum.

They played Gold Flower. Ante: 200 yuan. Guan Yu folded three hands coldly before raising 5,000 yuan on a pair of nines.

“Minimum’s 5,000,” a young heir corrected mockingly.

The bets escalated to 20,000. Guan Yu matched calmly, knowing his hand trumped all.

When opponents folded, he raked in 30,000 yuan. Behind him, Du Xiaojuan barely stifled a cheer.

Subsequent rounds saw Guan Yu oscillate between extreme caution and bold strikes, netting over 100,000 yuan. The veterans grew irritated—this novice kept slipping through their traps.

Yet as Guan Yu lit a cigarette, his poise never wavered. The true game had just begun.
