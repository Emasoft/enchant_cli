At this moment, Sakurako and Lanyu from behind also caught up. Both had been swimming while pushing the poplar trunk with their other hands. Acai similarly clung tightly to the trunk with one arm while vigorously paddling through the water with the other.

The twenty-meter-wide river was swiftly crossed by the three. Upon reaching shore, they gasped for breath—especially Lanyu, who slumped exhaustedly. "I'll never separate from Guanyu again," she complained. "If she were here, she could've carried me across! But no, I nearly killed myself hauling this wretched boy!"

"Enough," Sakurako said serenely. "We're family now. No need for complaints—we've crossed safely. Soon enough, Elder Brother and Guanyu will join us."

Acai flushed crimson at Lanyu's reproach. Plagued by deep-seated insecurity, he felt he'd brought nothing but trouble since meeting Guanyu.

Lowering his head in silence, the boy's burning cheeks betrayed his shame.

"We should hide quickly," Sakurako urged, scanning their surroundings. Drenched and ill-suited for further travel, the trio took comfort in the sweltering weather that would dry their clothes without risk of chill.

Meanwhile, Guanyu found herself in retreat. Though protected by her formidable Eggshell Guardian Shield, the enemy's overwhelming firepower threatened to penetrate even this defense. Bullets whizzed past as she dodged and retreated—one misstep from a lethal hit.

Wolf Second (Second to Wolf), however, faced fewer adversaries wielding inferior weapons. His defense remained comparatively effortless.

Guanyu fired her pistol while retreating, downing two foes. Yet their state-of-the-art armor rendered such efforts futile—these opponents were armed to the teeth.

As Wolf Second noted Sakurako's group had likely crossed the river, his movements accelerated. His battle-blade whirled, deflecting incoming bullets with uncanny precision. Gradually, a swirling wind barrier materialized before him, intercepting the barrage.

"BREAK!" His roar unleashed the tempest upon enemy ranks. The explosive detonation sent bodies flying, yet the armored foes rose unscathed, reloading weapons as they prepared renewed assault.

"Enough games—we withdraw!" Wolf Second barked. At Guanyu's nod, he added, "Cover me!"

Wind barriers erupted consecutively from Wolf Second—modest in power but sufficient to deflect bullets during their retreat. As the pair fell back, pursuing enemies received orders to advance.

Another concentrated blast from Wolf Second cleared their path. In the sudden silence, both warriors dashed riverward with preternatural speed, reaching the bank within breaths. From a concealed vantage, Sakurako spotted their approach.

"They're coming!" She began rising to signal when white smoke erupted before the approaching pair. Four figures materialized mid-river, weapons gleaming—the Four Venomous Blights.

"Four Venomous Blights?" Wolf Second frowned. Blocking their path across the twenty-meter span stood these infamous assassins from the Ding'e Organization—rivals to his own Legend Society. Though individually weaker, their combined tactics could challenge even Boundary Venerables.

The quartet's reputation preceded them: Poison (eldest, wielding toxic arts), Perversion (second, master seducer), Might (third, first-class venerable), and Gambit (youngest, card-throwing bone collector). Together, they formed a Composite Boundary Venerable—a force Wolf Second dared not underestimate.

"Who hired you?" Wolf Second demanded, calculating their deadly synergy. Beside him, Guanyu assessed their weapons—bloodied axe, suspicious rod, cleaver-like greatsword, and lethal playing cards.

"Think we can separate them?" Guanyu whispered. Wolf Second shook his head grimly as the Blights stood united. Behind them, pursuing gunmen had withdrawn, confident in their assassins' prowess.

From her hiding place, Sakurako bit her lip. Interference now could prove fatal. The true battle was about to begin.
