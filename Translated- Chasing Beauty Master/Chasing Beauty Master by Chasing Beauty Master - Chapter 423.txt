A pale, slender arm marred with numerous knife scars emerged from beneath the sleeve.

Guan Yu inhaled sharply. What depths of anguish must drive someone to self-mutilation like this?

After a steadying breath, he placed his hand over the jagged scars. Combining his diagnostic system with physical examination, he assessed Jiang Yiyi's condition. Minutes later, he withdrew with understanding.

"Yiyi, would you mind lying on the bed?"

Her suspicious glance prompted swift explanation: "No ulterior motives. I can cure your illness."

Contrary to assumptions, Jiang's "special autism" wasn't psychological—evidenced by her acceptance of Cao Xiping (Joyful Peace) and Dongfang Mu (Eastern Wood). Rather, it stemmed from a rare physiological disorder Guan Yu could treat through extended therapy.

"You... truly can heal me?"

For the first time, emotion cracked Jiang's impassive facade. She knew her condition intimately—the futile parade of psychologists and physicians, the gradual surrender to despair as parents and friends watched helplessly.

Her deterioration followed cruel logic: liver qi stagnation worsened by emotional distress, creating a vicious cycle of physical and mental decline.

"Trust me, Yiyi. I'll restore you."

As she settled on the bed, Guan Yu produced silver needles. Precise insertions at key acupoints preceded specialized massage techniques. Gradually, Jiang's tension dissolved into deep slumber. Working with feather-light touch, he removed the needles, tucked her in, and exited quietly.

The waiting trio—Jiang parents and Cao—swarmed him immediately. "Mr. Guan! How is she?"

Their anxiety was palpable. Previous physicians had fled after cursory examinations—none lingered two hours like Guan Yu. Hope hung thick in the air.

**Chapter 1058: Return Journey**

"Treatment proceeded smoothly. She should awaken soon with noticeable improvement." Guan Yu's directness cut through formalities.

"Truly, Dr. Guan?" Mrs. Jiang—Ding Xiaoqin—clutched her husband's arm, equal parts hope and disbelief staining her words. Years of disappointment made trust brittle.

"Within half an hour, we'll see results." His calm assurance steadied them.

"Tea! Refreshments!" The butler scurried off as Jiang Weirwen regained composure.

Cao blurted, "Cure Yiyi, and I'll work for you free!"

"Then I'll save considerably." Guan Yu grinned, recognizing this debt would secure Cao's loyalty.

Shifting conversation, Jiang Weirwen inquired, "What brings you to Taiwan, Mr. Guan? How did you meet Xiping?"

"Through your daughter's predicament." Guan Yu summarized Li Xi's kidnapping and Cao's involvement, omitting Wan Qianshan's fate. His supernatural abilities remained need-to-know.

"Taiwanese business ventures?" Jiang probed.

"Technology sector."

"Capital-intensive," Jiang observed. Though Guan's enterprises showed promise, their scale paled against Jiang's empire.

"Consider pharmaceuticals. With your medical prowess..."

The proposition hung—Jiang offered either collaborative development using Guan's formulas or distribution rights through their established networks. Both options promised wealth eclipsing his tech ventures' slow growth.

"Agreed. I'll draft formulas shortly."

**Chapter 1059: The Song Family**

Mid-discussion, Jiang Yiyi emerged—pink tracksuit, sleep-rubbed eyes. "Mom, I'm hungry."

Ding wept as she embraced her daughter. Two days' self-imprisonment had ended.

"Feel like walking outside?" Guan Yu offered.

Jiang Yiyi nodded. Sunlight called.

As gratitude poured forth, Guan Yu tempered celebrations: "Treatment requires three more months. Liver qi residuals linger."

"But you return to the mainland soon?" Cao interjected.

Jiang Weirwen resolved: "Yiyi accompanies you."

Guan Yu hesitated—explaining this beauty to his wives? Cao's teasing "You're getting lucky!" didn't help.

"I'll ensure her comfort," Guan finally conceded. With Cao joining them, plans solidified.

Taiwan's underworld ambitions faded as legitimate collaboration bloomed. After farewells, Guan returned to his hotel—empty. Li Xi and Song Xiaoya shopped, naturally.

His phone rang. Lin Dong reported: "That plane bully Cao Dahai's causing trouble. Brought Song family muscle."

**Chapter 1060: Reckoning**

At Ximending shopping district, porcine Cao Dahai leered at Song Xiaoya and Li Xi. Beside him stood Song Huanyu—self-proclaimed "true Song scion" versus Beijing's "branch family."

"Drink with us," Cao sneered, "or never return home!"

Li Xi's icy query cut through: "Related to Beijing Songs?"

"Merely offshoots," Song Huanyu boasted.

"Song prestige?" Guan Yu's mocking voice preceded his arrival.

Cao snarled, "You're dead!"

Song Huanyu gestured thugs forward—halted by Cao Xiping's bellow: "Touch Jiang family's future son-in-law? Kowtow to your uncle!"

Jiang Yiyi blushed crimson yet stayed silent. Guan Yu gaped at the impromptu engagement.

As Song's men hesitated, Guan Yu coldly assessed the bullies. Beijing grudges resurfaced—this Song would learn consequences.
