“Wan Hong, I believe you’ve already heard—Jiang Xin has been missing for an entire day, and there’s still no trace of her. Everyone is saying she’s been kidnapped. What should we do now?” Chu Fan spoke, his face drenched in sweat.

Chu Fan, despite needing a crutch to walk, had hobbled through several streets out of worry for Jiang Xin. He knew it was futile, but sitting idle at home had been unbearable. Anxiety gnawed at him relentlessly.

Guan Yu had initially intended to stay out of this affair. The Cao family’s target was the East Sea Dragon Pearl, and Jiang Xin herself was likely unharmed. Yet, after much deliberation, he couldn’t ignore it—Jiang Xin was a good woman, her father Jiang Yuan Kai was honorable, and aiding Chu Fan felt like the right course. Indifference was no longer an option.

With no other recourse, Chu Fan had turned to Wan Hong for help.

“We need to wait a little longer,” Guan Yu replied calmly. “Don’t panic. As we’ve surmised, Lady Jiang is not in mortal danger. Her captors want the East Sea Dragon Pearl, not her life.”

**Chapter 4915: Assistance**

“The East Sea Dragon Pearl?” Chu Fan finally recalled. “Wasn’t that already presented to the Emperor? Why would those bastards kidnap Jiang Xin?”

“Using Jiang Xin to extort the Dragon Pearl is their best strategy,” Guan Yu said impassively. “Whether the Pearl is with Jiang Yuan Kai or the Emperor, seizing her is their only leverage.”

Here, Guan Yu felt a pang of guilt. Had he not gifted the Dragon Pearl to Jiang Xin in the first place, none of this trouble would have arisen.

“Then why is Jiang Yuan Kai hesitating? He should trade the Pearl for her immediately! Does he want her corpse instead?” Chu Fan spat angrily.

Guan Yu detested Chu Fan’s temperament. “If that’s your opinion, go advise Jiang Yuan Kai yourself. He’s your future father-in-law. Convince him to surrender the Pearl and negotiate her release.”

Chu Fan fell silent, head bowed. He knew such bluntness wouldn’t resolve matters.

Guan Yu clasped his shoulder. “You came to me because you trust me. I swear Lady Jiang will remain unharmed.”

“Rashness won’t help now. The city gates are sealed, and the elite troops are scouring every corner. We must wait until their search concludes before planning our next move.” Guan Yu continued, “But rest assured—if an opportunity arises, I’ll bring her back.”

Chu Fan nodded mutely. In the capital, though adored as a celebrated actor, he was still merely an entertainer. His usual glamour meant nothing in this crisis. Friendless and powerless, he had no choice but to seek Guan Yu’s aid.

The elite troops acted swiftly. Tens of thousands combed the capital through the afternoon and night, conducting a meticulous, grid-by-grid search. Yet, as Guan Yu predicted, they found nothing—not even Jiang Xin’s two maidservants.

Guan Yu had anticipated this. Captives would be smuggled beyond the walls immediately. Du Teng had mentioned城外接应—mercenaries hired by Lord Cao awaited outside to spirit her away. Safety lay beyond the city.

The Emperor’s lockdown order came too late. The abduction occurred at dawn; Jiang Yuan Kai learned of it by noon. Hours of futile searching passed before the Grand Princess sought imperial intervention. By then, the trail had gone cold.

It was now past midnight. “Return home. All you can do is wait,” Guan Yu advised, patting Chu Fan’s shoulder. The latter limped away, a pitiable figure receding into the darkness.

“Must you meddle in court affairs?” Wang Xiaorong approached as Chu Fan left, holding fresh clothes. She’d discerned Guan Yu’s intent to venture out.

Guan Yu nodded. “Fetch my nightclothes. I’m going out. Perhaps this excursion will yield clues.”

“I must intervene. This is a step toward forging ties with the court—not for Jiang Yuan Kai, but to aid Prince Zou and the Crown Prince. If successful, the credit will be theirs.”

During his time in the capital, Guan Yu had operated on the imperial periphery. To obtain the Eight-Sided Drum technique, deeper court connections were essential. Aligning with the Crown Prince and Prince Zou would earn their gratitude. With the Cao family doomed and the Qin clan deterred by royal protection, his path would clear.

“Stay here. The streets are chaotic,” he instructed before departing.

Qiqí and Wang Xiaorong, for once, obeyed without protest—model embodiments of compliance.

Clad in black, face veiled, Guan Yu scaled rooftops under a starless sky. He moved like a shadowed raptor, aiming first for the city gates to rendezvous with the Crown Prince or Prince Zou before venturing beyond.

The capital thrummed with uneasy vigilance. Torches lit major thoroughfares where troops maintained patrols post-search. Tension hung thick as palace emissary Yu Kong reported to the Emperor.

“Your Majesty, Commander Jiang and I led the search from south to north. We breached every courtyard, opened every door, probed every crevice—yet found no trace of Lady Jiang or anything suspicious.”

The Grand Princess, steadfast until now, nearly crumpled at this news. Lesser mothers would have shattered sooner.

**Chapter 4916: Quarrel**

“Time has betrayed us,” the Grand Princess said. “Xin’er vanished at dawn. By noon, we knew. Half a day’s search yielded nothing before I sought your aid. The kidnappers surely fled the city upon seizing her.”

“Delay is unacceptable. Scour the ends of the earth, but bring her back alive!” The Emperor’s decree brooked no dissent.

“Yu Kong, deploy the elites beyond the walls! Order the Crown Prince to lift the lockdown but intensify gate inspections. Detain anyone suspicious!”

The command was folly—searching the boundless城外 was needle-in-haystack futility—but Yu Kong accepted it with a resigned bow. Rest would wait until Lady Jiang’s safe return.

The Crown Prince shuttled between gates, striving to prove his capability. The Southern and Northern Gates, opposing titans connected by the capital’s grand central avenue, demanded his constant attention.

Prince Zou, resting at the Crown Prince’s manor, found the fruitless search unsurprising. Meanwhile, Guan Yu recalled Du Teng’s words—materials for the Scarlet Opera House, stranded outside the Northern Gate due to the lockdown. Perhaps clues lay there.

Approaching the Northern Gate’s torchlit commotion, Guan Yu spotted the Crown Prince confronting another figure.

“Elder Brother, are you deliberately thwarting me? I have urgent business beyond the walls! Search my carriage if you must, but let me pass!” The Second Prince descended from his coach, indignation aflame.

The day’s humiliations festered—the Emperor awarding the Crown Prince a Yellow Jacket and command of Chancellor Li’s guards grated deeply. Now, denied passage to a midnight rendezvous at North Mountain Temple, his fury boiled over.

“By Father’s order, none may pass without his decree—not even the Empress!” The Crown Prince stood firm, towering over his sibling.

“You’re bluffing!” The Second Prince glared upward, resentment simmering. These were Chancellor Li’s men—his own allies—yet here they barred his way.

Prince Zou’s arrival interrupted the standoff. “Second Prince, what urgency drives you out tonight?”

“State affairs! Must I explain myself to you? Let me through!”

“Patience, Nephew. The lockdown lifts at dawn. Can this wait?” Prince Zou’s tone soothed, aware an imperial reprieve was imminent. Placating the vindictive Second Prince now would avert future strife.

Reluctantly, the Crown Prince yielded. As the gates groaned open, Guan Yu dropped silently behind them.

**Chapter 4917: Concealed Identity**

“Who goes there?” The Crown Prince spun, alert.

“Peace—it’s me.” Guan Yu lowered his mask, stepping into the torchlight.

“Guan Yu! When did you arrive?” Prince Zou smiled warmly.

“Your Highnesses.” Guan Yu bowed. “I’ve come regarding Lady Jiang. I’ve leads pointing城外. Also, monitor the Cao estate—they may be implicated.”

“The Cao family?” Prince Zou frowned.

“Speculation, but vigilance costs nothing. The lockdown’s end approaches. With your permission, I’ll investigate beyond the walls.”

“Agreed. I’ll deploy Hong to surveil them. You’ve met her, yes?”

Guan Yu’s eyes flickered at Hong’s name—a ghost from another life. Nodding, he melted back into the night, his mission clear beneath the suffocating sky.
