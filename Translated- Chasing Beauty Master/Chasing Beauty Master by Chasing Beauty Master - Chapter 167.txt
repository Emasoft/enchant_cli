Zhao Zilong sat down and looked at Fang Zhe, saying, “Fang Zhe, give me a detailed account of what happened.”

Guan Yu placed Zhao Jing'er on the bed and removed her beige cotton jacket. Her snow-white, tender left breast became fully exposed to the air. Guan Yu froze momentarily before glancing around to ensure no one would enter. His gaze lingered on her exposed form.

In the earlier crisis, Guan Yu had paid no heed to such details. Now, however, the scene before him formed a striking tableau—the smooth, firm curve of her breast crowned by a delicate pink peak. Though not his first time seeing Zhao Jing'er's body, he found himself captivated anew.

Resolving to treat her once more, Guan Yu reminded himself his intentions were purely medicinal. To act otherwise would make him no better than a lecher. His true concern lay in her awakening—without maids present, who would redress her? Certainly not Zhao Zilong, who'd likely shoot him on sight for such presumption.

Admittedly, this rationale also provided convenient justification for his touch. Without hesitation, he placed his right palm against her chilled breast, its icy softness peculiar yet intriguing. An involuntary squeeze elicited faint moan from the unconscious girl—a whisper-thin sound that reverberated through Guan Yu's mind like thunder.

He glanced nervously at Zhao Jing'er, relieved to find her still unconscious. Collecting himself, he murmured "Amitabha Buddha"—though the prayer's intent remained ambiguous—before closing his eyes to activate his healing system. The ancient coin in his mind shimmered with azure energy as warmth flowed from his palm into her chest, gradually nourishing her fragile heart.

After eight seconds, he opened his eyes to find Zhao Jing'er's luminous gaze fixed upon him. "You woke quickly," he remarked awkwardly. "How do you feel?"

Blushing furiously, the girl nodded. Though grateful to survive and see Guan Yu first upon waking, their compromising position flustered her. The lingering pressure of his hand on her breast—despite completed treatment—fueled both embarrassment and irritation.

Noticing her discomfort, Guan Yu asked, "Are you unwell?"

"Brother... have you finished treating me?" she countered pointedly.

Realization struck. Coughing discreetly, he withdrew his hand. "I... became distracted worrying about your condition."

An awkward silence descended until shattered by sudden clamor outside. Seizing the excuse, Guan Yu rose. "I'll investigate the noise. Change clothes and join us—your grandfather's worried."

The scene shifted to the parlor where Founding Marshal Zhao Zilong's wrath manifested in shattered teacups and stormy countenance. Fang Zhe maintained calm silence as Guan Yu approached. "Marshal, anger harms your health. What warrants such fury?"

"Lawless scum!" Zhao Zilong boomed. "Assassins dare threaten you in my capital? Fang Zhe! Mobilize security. That so-called 'King of Assassins' Lin Dong must be apprehended!"

Guan Yu's heart swelled with unexpected gratitude. Yet greater shock came with the title "King of Assassins"—an apex predator whose legendary gunmanship guaranteed fatal headshots. Why hadn't Lin Dong drawn his weapon during their encounter? The unspoken answer—that Guan Yu hadn't warranted such effort—would have rankled.

As plans solidified to use military resources against the assassin, Zhao Jing'er emerged wearing fresh attire. Her grandfather's demeanor softened instantly. "Come, sit with me," he urged, launching into affectionate chatter that eventually turned to romantic inquiries. When asked about potential suitors, her stolen glance toward Guan Yu betrayed more than words.

Perceptive old eyes noted the silent exchange. Though aware of Guan Yu's complicated romantic entanglements, Zhao Zilong chose discretion—his granddaughter's happiness outweighed outdated proprieties.

Later, as Guan Yu cleaned up, Zhao Jing'er's playful demeanor masked deepening concern. Walking through Zhongnanhai's illuminated grounds, she finally voiced her fear: "Stay here with me these days, please?"

The unspoken plea hung heavy—safety within government confines versus peril beyond. Yet Guan Yu's resolve hardened. Passive defense offered no solution. To end the threat, he'd become bait, leveraging his mysterious coin's powers to turn hunter against hunted.

Their stroll continued, arms linked, unspoken tensions simmering beneath night's tranquil facade. In this guarded sanctuary of power, a deadly game of cat-and-mouse was being set in motion—one that would test limits of skill, courage, and the strange artifact binding Guan Yu to his fate.
