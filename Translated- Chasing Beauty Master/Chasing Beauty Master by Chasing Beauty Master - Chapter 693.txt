Though separated by the ring of ice shards, Guan Yu could still sense that the spiritual energy within Xue Jing had far exceeded her capacity to endure. Yet the torrent of energy from above showed no sign of ceasing, continuing to pour relentlessly into her body. The young girl began to weep in terror, her slight frame emitting faint cracking sounds as if she might shatter at any moment.

Guan Yu's gaze remained fixed on Xue Jing's face. Though he attempted to probe her condition with his divine sense, the ice barrier repelled all intrusion. Watching her anguish, his heart felt as though pierced by blades. Should any harm befall her, he knew the weight of regret would crush him utterly.

Now, fear took root in his heart. Perhaps that ancient voice's words had been mere deception—a ploy to lure them here and seize control of someone with supreme elemental affinity?

**Chapter 1761: Enthralled**

Their acquaintance had been brief. Their first meeting occurred in that city park when Guan Yu, freshly returned from the Demon Tower, had chosen to rest there overnight. By chance, he'd intervened when Xue Jing was being harassed.

To him then, it had been a simple act of chivalry. But from the moment their eyes met, the nineteen-year-old girl became convinced this man was her destined partner.

Though too young to comprehend true love, an instinctive dependence had overwhelmed her maidenly reserve. She'd clung to him daily, playfully addressing him as "husband."

Now, upon the ice platform, an invisible force—whether the glacial surface's grip or some potent suction—rooted Xue Jing in place. She longed to leap into Guan Yu's warm embrace, yet found herself utterly immobilized.

As spiritual energy saturated every fiber of her being, Xue Jing felt her body slipping beyond her control. Only a sliver of clarity remained in her mind. Panic engulfed her—the visceral certainty of impending death.

It was as if the world had abandoned her. Her beloved stood mere zhang away, yet separated by the chasm between life and death. She strained to meet Guan Yu's gaze, yearning to clasp his steady hand and face any peril together.

But the paper-thin ice barrier rendered them worlds apart. Xue Jing understood this hope for naught.

*If only I were stronger—his equal. These cursed restraints couldn't hold me. This terrible energy wouldn't rupture my form.*

In her eyes, Guan Yu read her desperate wish—for shared resistance against the raging energies above. With a roar, he lunged at the ice barrier, golden light coalescing into a massive sword in his palm. Channeling his full power, he prepared to strike.

Strangely, witnessing Xue Jing's torment had shattered his customary composure. The ancient voice's warnings about the Five Polar Origins being crucial to saving their world faded from mind. Only her salvation mattered now.

Jones, who had been relying on Guan Yu's infused energy to withstand the bone-numbing cold, saw his master charging madly toward the icy cylinder. The sword's aura flared dangerously as Guan Yu raised it high. "Master, stop!" he screamed, ignoring his own frostbitten limbs to grapple Guan Yu from behind.

Though uncertain of Xue Jing's condition, Jones recognized his master's abnormality. Previously anxious yet controlled, Guan Yu now resembled a stranger—this impulsive assault contradicted his usual strategic nature. Would breaching the ice not risk her explosive demise?

But reason had abandoned Guan Yu. Crimson-eyed, he swung the colossal blade downward with a bestial roar.

Within the icy prison, Xue Jing's numb body paradoxically heightened her perceptions. Though earlier unable to sense external presences amidst the energy influx, she now perceived Guan Yu's derangement.

"*Husband!*" Her lips formed the cry, soundless beyond the barrier.

The spiritual sword struck. Though no audible impact echoed, the energy column above quivered. Then the golden blade exploded into fragments. Guan Yu hurtled backward like cannon shot, cratering the distant ice wall. Blood trickled from his lips.

"*Don't!*" Xue Jing's silent scream went unheard. Never had she witnessed her invincible love wounded—he who always vanquished foes with effortless grace.

Guan Yu staggered up, shaking off ice shards. A new sword materialized—smaller, dimmer—as he marched forward again. Jones intercepted him, shouting, "You'll harm Senior Sister!"

"*Harm her?*" Guan Yu's lips twisted coldly, dragging the blade. "*The demonic cultivators control her! Release me or die!*"

Though ignorant of "demonic cultivators," Jones knew Xue Jing's state resulted from Guan Yu's own Primordial Pearl—the artifact he'd said held Earth's fate. Weak as he was, Jones recognized this madness as possession, not reason.

Inside the barrier, Xue Jing sensed the energy influx peaking. As the column dwindled, her consciousness floated free—a disembodied soul hovering above the cavern.

**Chapter 1762: Have I Died?**

Watching Guan Yu threaten Jones, Xue Jing cried soundless warnings. Guan Yu stood heaving, glaring at the frostbitten disciple clinging to his legs. Conflict raged within.

Turning, Xue Jing beheld her physical form—now cerulean as glacial sculpture. Eerily beautiful, this detached perspective revealed her anew.

Horror struck as she looked down: her soul-form lacked substance. No body, not even the motion of "looking"—mere illusion of thought.

*Am I dead?*

Her essence strained toward Guan Yu, immobile and mute. Only observation remained.

*So this is death—painless. But... I never bore him that daughter...*

Agony transcended physicality. In moments, she aged centuries—from playful girl to time-worn crone, lifetimes compressed.

Unbeknownst to either, the Five Polar Origins weren't brought by the ancient voice, but were Earth's birthright. The Five Elements—metal, wood, earth, water, fire—underpinned creation itself. From primordial singularity came yin-yang duality, then the Five Phases that shaped reality. By resonating with the Northern Water Origin, Xue Jing had absorbed elemental quintessence—a truth far beyond her novice comprehension.

Guan Yu's roar shattered contemplation. He kicked Jones away, the disciple crumpling unconscious against the wall. Xue Jing's soul winced as Guan Yu turned desperate eyes to her lifeless body—pale and serene as meditating celestial.

Howling grief, Guan Yu became whirlwind of destruction. Each sword-strike against the barrier rebounded cruelly, fracturing bones and ice alike. Jones stirred weakly, pleading unheard. Xue Jing's heart (had she possessed one) would have bled watching her love's suicidal assaults.

**Chapter 1763: Demonic Possession**

Had Guan Yu retained reason, he'd have questioned: How could a newly ascended Saint-level cultivator perish from pure energy infusion? Why did his界尊 (World Sovereign) cultivation succumb so easily to frenzy?

Madness precluded such thoughts. Again and again he charged, a broken puppet of obsession. Jones crawled doggedly, intercepting Guan Yu's latest rebound. Though ribs cracked, he pinned his master down.

Gradually, the crimson receded from Guan Yu's eyes. "*Jones? Why restrain me?*" he rasped, noting their mutual injuries. "*Did enemies attack?*"

As clarity returned, both Xue Jing's soul and the battered disciple sighed relief. Guan Yu surveyed his ruined body—fractured meridians, depleted dantian. Even standing proved arduous.

"*What happened here?*" he murmured, mind sluggish yet alarmed. Since returning to Earth, none could challenge his World Sovereign prowess—not even combined Saint-level foes. This devastation defied reason...
