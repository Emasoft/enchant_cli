“A pass?”

Gao Wei extended a hand toward the sky, smiling at Guan Yu.

Guan Yu wore an expression of resigned reluctance, sighing softly before raising his hand to clasp Gao Wei’s cold right palm.

A blush flashed across Gao Wei’s cheeks as her smile bloomed like a flower.

Yet flowers inevitably wither.

*Rustle...*

Every word of Guan Yu and Gao Wei’s conversation echoed clearly in the ears of the audience, sparking waves of gasps and murmurs. Countless eyes stared in disbelief at the two on stage.

So Guan Yu was the host!

So Gao Wei’s greatest wish was to sing a duet with him!

So their onstage posture was so intimate!

What exactly was their relationship?

The question lingered in every mind, haunting and inescapable.

The reporters, electrified as if discovering a new continent, trained their cameras on the pair, flashbulbs popping incessantly.

Gao Wei raised the microphone to her lips, her eyes brimming with tenderness. A soft exhale, and her crystalline voice began to resonate through the hall:

*Meeting on the street*
*Speeding cars made us familiar*
*Cold lake under night’s chill*
*Warm quilts—so near, yet far*
*Affection blossomed*
*Dawn’s glow—I’d live or die with you*
*Knowing you, I knew love*

*Owing you a kiss*
*After the kiss, I swore to forget love*
*Forget love...*

A cappella, pure and unadorned.

No musical accompaniment, yet brimming with ineffable charm. Like wine aged to perfection, its aroma vanished the moment the seal was broken.

**Chapter 838: The Kiss I Owe You**

Time brewed love, only for it to wound in return.

Some face love’s scars courageously; others flee.

Gao Wei chose the latter, expressing her love through song.

Even a cappella, the audience was enraptured. They might not grasp her love, but they felt its fragility and preciousness through her voice.

Yet the refrain—“forget love”—brought both heartache and pity.

Guan Yu understood. These lyrics chronicled their journey from meeting to mutual understanding.

Silent, the copper coin in his mind glowed blue. His探查系统 (Detection System) activated, invisible energy threads reaching into Gao Wei’s mind.

He grew quieter still.

Gao Wei loved him, yet chose to abandon this unrequited love. Her decision pained Guan Yu, but he respected it.

*What is love? Who can define it?*

As the song ended, the stadium fell silent.

Gao Wei opened her eyes, twin tears tracing her cheeks. Her alabaster face wore loneliness and sorrow.

This song, born after leaving Guan Yu’s villa, encapsulated her tangled emotions—a melody of love and pain.

Even when her agency later begged to include it in her albums, she refused. Until one day, *Forget Love* resurfaced, catapulting her to global fame.

*Clap! Clap! Clap!*

Applause erupted, thunderous and heartfelt.

Then time froze.

The crowd gaped at Gao Wei’s next move.

“I owe you a kiss!”

She switched off her mic, whispered in Guan Yu’s ear, then stood on tiptoe, her lips brushing his cheek.

Guan Yu stood stunned.

He understood this kiss’ origin—a bet made during their wilderness escapade. But why risk her pristine image?

Love, once deep, becomes inescapable.

When Guan Yu regained his senses, Gao Wei had vanished.

Chaos erupted.

“You! The president wants you in his office!” Wang Dachui, the administrator, barked.

Ignored, Wang sneered: “You’ve disgraced the school! Expulsion awaits!”

“Piss off. I’m not in the mood,” Guan Yu growled.

“You dare threaten me? You’re finished here!”

“I said,” Guan宇 grabbed Wang’s collar, “*get lost*.”

A shove sent Wang sprawling.

“Remember this,” Guan Yu loomed over him. “Insult my woman again, and you’re dead.”

Wang staggered away, vowing revenge.

That night, as the world buzzed over the scandal, Guan Yu slept exhaustedly.

In the dark, a sigh echoed.

**Chapter 840: The Storm Breaks**

Though the celebration succeeded, the fallout from Guan Yu’s scandal overshadowed it. Media outlets scrambled to dig into his past, while university officials scrambled to contain the damage.

The storm had just begun.
