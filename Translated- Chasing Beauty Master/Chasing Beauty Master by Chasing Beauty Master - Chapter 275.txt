“Liu Shilei gently closed the door, stretched lazily, and took a deep breath of the fresh air—something impossible to savor in the city—instantly shaking off the fatigue from last night’s insomnia.

“Dear, why are you up so early? Shouldn’t you rest more?” Guan Zhongfu, who had risen early to busy himself in the courtyard, greeted Liu Shilei with a warm, rustic smile.

From the moment he laid eyes on Liu Shilei yesterday, Guan Zhongfu had taken a liking to this daughter-in-law. After getting acquainted over dinner last night, he grew utterly delighted with her grace, elegance, and virtuous demeanor. He repeatedly murmured that the Guan ancestors must have accumulated immense virtue over generations to bless Guanyu with such a wife.

“Unc—” Liu Shilei startled at the sudden voice, catching herself before uttering “Uncle” and instead saying, “Dad, you’re up so early! After drinking so much last night, does your head hurt?”

The title “Dad” was something Guanyu had urged her to use the previous night, reasoning that since she was now his wife brought home, calling him “Uncle” felt too distant. Besides, when Guanyu met Liu Shilei’s parents, he’d boldly addressed her father as “Father-in-law,” which had thrilled Liu Bingrong. It would’ve been unfair if Liu Shilei didn’t reciprocate by calling Guan Zhongfu “Dad.”

Thus, blushing, Liu Shilei softly called out “Dad,” sending Guan Zhongfu into such joy that he drank heavily last night—though it didn’t stop him from rising early.

“See how thoughtful she is, worrying about Dad drinking too much,” Guanyu remarked.

Guan Zhongfu’s smile widened. “I’m hardy—that bit of liquor’s nothing. Dear, you’ll need to adjust a little. The countryside isn’t as comfortable as the city. Did you sleep cold last night? I’m sorry you had to wake so early.”

Regret tinged his expression.

“It’s fine,” Liu Shilei reassured with a smile. “I just wanted to rise early and breathe the fresh air. Opportunities like this are rare.”

Guan Zhongfu, embodying the simplicity and kindness of rural folk, exuded an approachable warmth—a key reason Liu Shilei quickly bridged the gap between daughter-in-law and father-in-law.

“If you’d like, visit more often with Guanyu. I’ll renovate the house so you’ll stay comfortably next time,” Guan Zhongfu offered.

“No need for trouble. The current arrangement is fine,” Liu Shilei demurred, not wanting to appear pampered.

“It’s no bother. I’ve worked construction for years—it’s my expertise,” Guan Zhongfu insisted. “Besides, now that both my sons have found wives—you and Zhangxiao are such fine ladies—marrying them is their fortune. We can’t let you live in hardship. When you wed, a new house will make the celebration merrier.”

Liu Shilei flushed, touched yet uncertain. Since Guanyu’s recent confession about his other relationships—including Mo Ling, whom he hadn’t hidden—she’d accepted his honesty, despite her twinges of jealousy.

As Guanyu emerged, he chimed in: “Dad’s right. When we marry, a new house is a must. Leave the renovations to me—I’ll make the envy of the village!”

Guan Zhongfu frowned. “Stay grounded. No flashy vanity.”

Guanyu grinned mischievously. “I meant the village will envy us for having two beautiful, virtuous wives!”

Guan Zhongfu pondered, then nodded. “True. We can’t wrong the girls. Hurt them, and I’ll thrash you!”

Guanyu vowed, “I’ll ensure my wife is the happiest woman alive,” his gaze tender on Liu Shilei.

Guan Zhongfu rolled his eyes. “Stay serious.”

Turning to Liu Shilei, he added, “Ignore his boasts. Happiness is what matters. If he wrongs you, tell me.”

Liu Shilei, moved by their warmth, helped paste spring couplets—a task Guan Zhongfu initially refused but relented under her insistence.

As the day unfolded, the house brimmed with festivity. By noon, a lavish meal awaited.

Post-lunch, the men—tipsy—paid respects to ancestors. That night, Zhangxiao commandeered Guanyu’s room for girl talk, leaving him to bond with Guan Tian and Lin Dong over drinks.

In the room, Zhangxiao prodded Liu Shilei about Guanyu’s sudden wealth. Reluctantly, Liu Shilei revealed his dual identity as a underworld leader.

Zhangxiao gasped. “A mafia boss?!”

Liu Shilei nodded. “N and L cities’ underworld.”

As the night deepened, conversations meandered through relationships, futures, and secrets—each revelation weaving a richer tapestry of their intertwined lives.
