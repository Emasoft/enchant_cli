Under normal circumstances, no one would seek to kill such an elderly person—neither wealthy nor possessing treasures. Even thieves wouldn't bother with such a household.

Outside, someone announced the arrival of a person. Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng stepped out to find Mayor Wang's wife, Li Hong (Red Plum), brought over from a coffin shop in the western district. She wore an oversized black tracksuit—clearly belonging to Mayor Wang—with a beige headscarf wrapped around her head. Earlier, Guan Yu had noticed Li Hong concealing bundles of white and hemp cloth beneath her clothes to deliver mourning garments to the Li family.

When Li Hong arrived, she exchanged a silent glance with Mayor Wang. The moment her hiding place at the coffin shop had been discovered, she knew her scheme was unraveled.

The coffin containing Grandma Wang lay open as the elderly physician examined it. Turning to Li Hong with an impassive expression, he said, “Li Hong, we’d like you to recount this morning’s events. You were the first to discover Grandma Wang’s passing.”

The physician, a highly respected figure in town, addressed the mayor’s wife by name without formalities.

Without hesitation, Li Hong replied, “This morning, I planned to make dumplings for Grandma Wang. Worried she might have already eaten, I came early to inform her. But when I arrived, I found her lifeless on the floor. Frightened, I immediately ran back to notify the mayor.”

Though Li Hong avoided mentioning the Li family, Guan Yu remained patient. Truth required methodical unraveling.

With no concrete evidence or murder weapon, the investigation proceeded cautiously. The physician nodded, having already heard about Mayor Wang’s subsequent arrival and arrangements.

“Did you notice anything suspicious when you arrived?” the physician pressed.

Li Hong feigned thought before shaking her head. “No. It was still dark. I only saw the door ajar and her body on the floor before fleeing.”

“What time exactly did you arrive?”

“Around five o’clock, perhaps. I don’t recall precisely.”

When questioned, one of the mayor’s subordinates—trembling nervously—claimed he hadn’t checked the time during the hurried summons.

The physician then turned to Mayor Wang. “A witness claims they saw you heading toward the western district near the coffin shop around four this morning, only to turn back. What were you doing?”

Caught off guard, the mayor stammered, “I’ve recently taken up power walking for exercise. As a doctor, you understand the benefits of morning workouts.”

“I specialize in medicine, not fitness,” the physician countered. “Odd that no one’s mentioned your alleged exercise routine before.”

“Perhaps I’ve always risen too early for others to notice,” the mayor deflected.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu examined Grandma Wang’s body. Her modest yet well-tailored clothes appeared aged and ill-fitting—likely hand-me-downs from wealthier households. Finding no obvious wounds, he noted only disheveled hair. Within the strands, he discovered faint beige threads.

The physician’s interrogation continued, covering every detail from coffin delivery to those who handled the body, yet yielding nothing. Abruptly, the elderly doctor confronted Li Hong. “The time of death aligns with your visit. You’re the prime suspect.”

Li Hong protested, “She was already dead when I arrived! Just because I found her doesn’t make me the killer!”

Guan Yu intervened, presenting threads from the corpse’s hair. “These match your headscarf’s loose fibers. You *did* make contact with her.”

“Many own similar scarves!” Li Hong retorted. “This proves nothing!”

Undeterred, Guan Yu lifted Grandma Wang’s hand. “Her nails hold navy blue fragments—identical to your chipped nail polish. When she struggled against her attacker, she scraped them from your fingers.”

The crowd erupted as Li Hong stared at the evidence. Silent tears replaced her defiance.

“Confess your motive,” Guan Yu demanded.

Li Hong’s chilling laugh silenced the room. “I did it alone. To create chaos so the Li family could escape. Kill me if you must.”

“You sacrificed an elder for fugitives?” the physician roared.

“No further explanations.” Li Hong knelt, her hollow stare meeting the crowd’s outrage. “I accept any punishment.”

The physician shook with disgust. “To murder such a venerable soul… You’re utterly heartless.”
