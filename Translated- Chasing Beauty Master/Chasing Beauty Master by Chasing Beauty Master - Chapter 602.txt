This cycle did not last long before Guan Yu ceased feeling that excruciating pain. Vaguely, he sensed magical elements brushing against his skin before vanishing. Startled by this peculiar sensation, he realized—could this be the magical element perception Bika Cat had mentioned? With rising excitement, Guan Yu immediately focused his mind to sense those fleeting elements. *Whoosh, whoosh...*

As the magical elements continuously grazed his skin before disappearing, Guan Yu's heart surged with exhilaration. If the earlier sensation had been an illusion, this was undeniable reality—he could now perceive the free-floating magical elements around him!

"**I’ve truly sensed them!**" he inwardly roared. Though faint, this awareness filled him with joy. Soon, Guan Yu became wholly immersed in that wondrous sensation. Gradually, his perception of the elements intensified, though he still couldn’t distinguish their types. Yet among the myriad elements, one variety pulsed with particular strength—a throbbing resonance that soon birthed an audacious thought: *Could I commune with this element?*

Abruptly, swirling vortices materialized around Guan Yu, churning the previously calm air. Outside the magical barrier, Bika Cat—who had been meditating—snapped open his eyes and shouted, **"Guan Yu! Don’t rush to commune with them yet! Use your internal spiritual energy to accelerate the flow of magical energy within your body!"**

Obediently withdrawing his focus, Guan Yu channeled his spiritual energy to quicken the magical currents inside him. As he did, the vortices around him grew fiercer, and his perception sharpened. Delighted by his progress, he hastened the energy’s flow—only for Bika Cat to caution, **"Steady! Maintain your pace. Focus on the strongest element you sense and try to *harness* it!"**

Slowing his efforts, Guan Yu poured his entire being into perceiving the elements. Gradually, the once-elusive magical particles began coalescing toward his outstretched palm. Watching this, Bika Cat nodded approvingly. **"Not bad, brat. To gather ambient elements so quickly—even a tiny cluster—is commendable."**

Guan Yu, now in a profound trance, remained oblivious to his surroundings. Over time, the crackling lightning arcs coating his body dimmed and vanished. As the last spark dissipated, the vortices faded. Sensing the shift, Guan Yu stirred and opened his eyes to find Bika Cat grinning at him.

**"Impressive comprehension, kid,"** Bika Cat remarked. **"I expected half a day for you to grasp magic’s threshold, yet here you are—awake in two hours."**

"Did I...succeed?" Guan Yu breathed.

In answer, Bika Cat gestured to Guan Yu’s right hand. There, cradled in his palm, flickered a luminous, irregular orb crackling with lightning.

**"That,"** Bika Cat explained, **"is the thunder element you sensed—extracted from the second-grade Thunder Devourer’s magical core. You’ve merely refined existing elements, not drawn them from the world. Until you can gather ambient magic unaided, you’re not yet a true mage."**

Guan Yu’s face fell. **"Must I always rely on cores? Can’t I ever collect elements myself?"**

**"Patience,"** Bika Cat chided. **"This was merely training wheels. True mastery comes when you forge your Magical Core. Only then will you command the heavens’ elements."**

Though disheartened, Guan Yu’s resolve reignited at Bika Cat’s promise: **"Endure the trials ahead, and I’ll mold you into a formidable Magic Alchemist."**

**"Now that you perceive magical elements,"** Bika Cat declared, **"I’ll teach you basic spells."**

Eyes blazing with zeal, Guan Yu knelt and performed a formal bow. **"Disciple greets Master!"**

Chuckling, Bika Cat tossed him a tome. **"This grimoire will help you condense a Magical Core—your key to true magic."**

"What’s a Magical Core?"

**"Like a cultivator’s Golden Core channels spiritual energy, your Magical Core will store elemental power. The stronger the core, the greater your magic."**

Guan Yu grimaced—he hadn’t even formed a Golden Core yet. Bika Cat, sensing his doubt, added, **"Fear not. Mastery takes time. Meanwhile, study this."** He threw another book. *Thunder Arts* gleamed on its cover.

Inside, Guan Yu found three spells: *Thunder Blade* (a striking spell), *Wind Thunder Step* (a movement enhancer), and *Heaven’s Thunderfall* (an area-devastating tier-two spell).

**"Train diligently,"** Bika Cat growled, suddenly severe. **"Many sought my tutelage and were refused. Disappoint me, and I’ll strip your power myself—I’ll tolerate no disgrace!"**

**"I swear to persevere!"** Guan Yu vowed.

**Chapter 1528: Thunder Element**

Retreating to meditate, Guan Yu followed the grimoire’s instructions: *To forge a Magical Core, first anchor a strand of ambient element within your dantian.*

Closing his eyes, he willed the swirling magical vortices closer. His consciousness tentatively probed one vortex—nearly getting shredded in the maelstrom. *So this is why few dare magic cultivation,* he realized, shaken.

Undeterred, he persisted. After an arduous half-hour, his mind brushed a responsive thread—thunder element! Guiding it painstakingly to his palm, he then faced the true trial: transferring it into his dantian.

The moment the lightning thread touched his energy center, agony erupted. The rebellious element writhed, threatening to escape. Remembering the text’s advice, Guan Yu enveloped it with spiritual energy. The element feinted surrender before darting aside—outsmarting him.

**"You little—!"** Enraged, Guan Yu marshaled dozens of energy tendrons. His dantian became a battleground as he cornered the fugitive spark. **"Now *rotate*!"**

Forcing the element into a spinning orbit, he stabilized it through sheer will. Sweat-drenched and trembling, he grinned triumphantly. *First step done. Now...the real work begins.*
