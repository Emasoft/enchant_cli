“But now that something has happened to him, not a single soul stepped forward to help. This chilled Feitianlang's heart to the core. Worse still, the village chief—fearing misfortune might fall upon himself—actually sent people to drive Feitianlang out of the village.

After being expelled, though abandoned by all, he resolved never to surrender.

Rushing back to the village outskirts, he found his wife collapsed on the ground, utterly drained from weeping. The child in her arms had cried so hard its voice had gone hoarse, its tiny mouth gaping soundlessly as tears streamed down.

Witnessing their plight, he burned with self-loathing for his helplessness and seethed at the villagers' heartlessness. Had more men joined him, they could have scared off the wolves. Yet not a single soul offered aid.

The wolves seemed to be deliberately waiting for the woman's strength to wane. Circling silently, the cunning pack bided their time until their prey was utterly defenseless before moving in.

As the exhausted woman slumped at the center of the pack, an enormous alpha wolf threw its head back and howled. The five or six wolves began closing in.

With a roar, Feitianlang charged forward wielding his butcher's knife. Fear had abandoned him; his bloodshot eyes blazed with the fury of a man ready to tear apart every threat to his family.

A wolf lunged at him, and man and beast tumbled together in a frenzy. He felt neither the fangs sinking into his flesh nor the claws raking his skin. With sheer force, he plunged his blade into the beast's heart.

But when he staggered to his feet, the scene before him froze his blood—a nightmare he would carry to his grave.

The massive alpha wolf was tearing into his wife's body while the remaining pack stood guard, their heads swiveling vigilantly. It was as if their leader feasted while his underlings kept watch.

**Chapter 2572: The Massacre**

No resistance remained. The ground swam with blood. His wife's mutilated body lay in tatters. At this sight, Feitianlang's rage erupted into an inferno.

Bellowing, he threw himself at the pack. By the battle's end, Feitianlang stood grievously wounded, clinging to life. Though he had slaughtered every wolf, his family was already gone—only mangled corpses remained.

Bleeding profusely, he crawled to their side, consumed by agony. Yet through unimaginable willpower, he survived. No ordinary man could have endured such mauling—every inch of his flesh shredded—yet he lived.

From that day, his heart turned to ice. He cursed the villagers' cowardice for sealing his family's fate. Uncontrollable fury consumed him.

Wiping bloody tears, he rose unsteadily. In his right hand gleamed the butcher's knife; his left clutched the alpha wolf's severed paw. Thus armed, he returned to the village to exact vengeance.

By dawn, the mountain hamlet had become a graveyard. Those who fled survived; those who stayed met his blade without mercy. Men, women, children—none were spared by the blood-mad Feitianlang.

Overnight, the village perished. Feitianlang vanished, presumed dead from his wounds. Jiang Yue's tale became legend—until years later, when survivors spread stories of his lone wolf-slaying, dubbing him "Feitianlang" (Sky-Soaring Wolf).

Jiang Yue had been forced to this extremity. The villagers' callousness birthed this monster. The true villains weren't the wolves, but the humans who refused aid.

When Feitianlang reappeared, he bore a wolf's paw encased in metal—a grisly memento and weapon. Renowned as the most ruthless of the Ten Great Villains, he acknowledged no allies, living solely by his own brutal code.

Though rarely initiating conflict, any provocation triggered relentless pursuit—a fight to the death regardless of opponents' strength. Now, coveting the treasure map said to be on Guan Yu, he kidnapped Xiao Wang's mother to force cooperation.

**Chapter 2573: The Impoverished Monks**

Xiao Wang's nervousness while delivering drugged water betrayed him to Guan Yu's sharp eyes.

Guan Yu frowned. Yesterday, he'd dealt with Two Evils—now Feitianlang appeared. Were all Ten converging on City A? Worse, why did they target him despite his planted rumors about the map being with Feng Family and Yingshan Gu?

Who leaked information? The only suspects were the four monks...

Feitianlang swaggered in, ignoring Xiao Wang's demands for payment. After confirming his victims' drugged state, he sneered: "Your mother's free. Money? I'll pay when I have it."

"You promised!" Xiao Wang protested. "We had a deal!"

"Deal?" Feitianlang's laughter turned icy. "You think scum like you deserve honesty? Run now, or die."

Terrified, Xiao Wang fled. Feitianlang then administered antidotes to the monks.

As the monks stirred, Shenghai—the calmest—addressed the intruder: "This is the Buddha Hall. You shouldn't..."

"Shut your mouth!" Feitianlang roared. "I go where I please!"

When Shenghai tried rising, he collapsed—poisoned and weakened. Xiaobai diagnosed: "The toxin saps our strength."

The bearded monk raged: "We sheltered you! This is how you repay kindness?"

"Kindness?" Feitianlang's bitter laugh echoed. "You dare speak of repaying? Hypocrites! You're all the same—selfish beasts!"

Guan Yu, feigning unconsciousness, understood Feitianlang's misanthropy stemmed from that village's betrayal. Years hadn't dulled his trauma—only deepened his hatred.

**Chapter 2574: Defiance**

Feitianlang revealed his scheme: "Awake, you'll take blame for drugging Guan Yu. Cooperate, and we'll split the treasure map's riches."

"Never!" The bearded monk spat. "Kill me first!"

Guan Yu silently admired this unyielding integrity. In an age of treachery, such steadfastness was rare.

"Fool!" Feitianlang sneered. "Side with him and gain nothing!"

"Jiang Yue is my friend. I don't betray friends." The monk's resolve never wavered, even with death looming.

Lying motionless, Guan Yu felt an unexpected warmth. Here was someone worthy of true friendship—a man who chose principles over profit, even at mortal peril.
