With so many people present here, all eager to forge a connection with Miss Jiang, yet none having the opportunity, it was astonishing when Miss Jiang herself proposed friendship to Guan Yu—an honor every man in the capital would covet.

Chu Fan kept reminding her at her side, but she seemed resolute. Having received such a generous gift of extraordinary beauty, it would be ungracious to refuse.

Guan Yu had been waiting for this moment. Turning back respectfully, he said, “My surname is Wan, with the given name Hong.”

“Wan Hong?” Miss Jiang repeated softly, as if etching the name into her memory. “Very well. From this moment, we are friends—if you’re willing.”

Envy rippled through the crowd at her words, but none could deny that only a treasure like the East Sea Dragon Pearl could capture Miss Jiang’s attention. Possessing such a relic rendered courting her favor unnecessary—after all, its rumored hidden treasures could grant one every desire.

Many silently noted this turn of events. Soon, whispers of the Dragon Pearl’s resurgence after decades would spread across the martial world, inevitably stirring a storm of bloodshed over its secrets.

Extending her delicate hand, Miss Jiang added, “Should you ever need assistance in the capital, seek me out. I’ll help however I can—consider this my gratitude for your priceless gift.”

**Chapter 4773: A Match Made in Heaven**

Guan Yu gently clasped her soft, jade-like hand—its texture akin to supple satin—and smiled. “To befriend Miss Jiang is the fortune of three lifetimes’ cultivation.”

“You flatter me,” she replied. “Such generosity deserves equal courtesy.”

Though reluctant to release her hand, Guan Yu maintained his composure, aware of Chu Fan’s watchful gaze. Lingering might provoke the man’s displeasure or tarnish his own image.

Chu Fan interjected, “Jiang Xin, you shouldn’t befriend strangers so hastily. His intentions are unclear, and as an outsider—” His tone carried protective concern.

Miss Jiang laughed lightly. “Since he gifted me this treasure, his character speaks for itself.”

Guan Yu glanced at Chu Fan. “You two appear a perfect match—talent and beauty united. Rest assured, my interest lies solely in the obsidian gem, not in disrupting your bond. The Dragon Pearl was merely a means to that end. Understand this clearly.”

Chu Fan’s skeptical expression betrayed lingering distrust. Any man would crave proximity to someone of Miss Jiang’s status and beauty—how could Wan Hong be an exception?

Sensing his jealousy, Guan Yu remarked diplomatically, “Though new to the capital, your reputation precedes you, Brother Chu.”

“Indeed!” Miss Jiang chimed proudly. “Even His Majesty knows of Brother Chu Fan’s fame.”

Guan Yu nodded. Chu Fan’s renown was undeniable, though his pettiness marred the impression. “Earlier, you seemed aloof toward Miss Jiang. It’s heartening to see your care.”

The barb struck true. Chu Fan’s earlier aloofness contrasted starkly with Miss Jiang’s open affection—a dynamic rooted in deeper struggles. Despite his status as a celebrated performer, Princess Chang, Miss Jiang’s mother, deemed him unworthy—a mere “entertainer” beneath her daughter’s station.

Forced to distance himself to avoid royal wrath, Chu Fan nurtured ambitions of proving his worth. Only then could he bridge the chasm between their social standings and earn approval to wed Miss Jiang.

Recognizing the tension, Guan Yu tactfully withdrew. “I’ll take my leave. Enjoy your time together.” Retrieving the obsidian gem, he retreated to observe the next auction phase.

**Chapter 4774: Opposition**

The auctioneer’s hammer fell—Miss Jiang secured the gem for 30,000 taels, publicly pledging it to Guan Yu. True to her reputation, she received the gem immediately, payment deferred without question.

To Guan Yu, the exchange was worthwhile. Authentic or not, the Dragon Pearl’s mythical treasures paled against the gem’s immediate value—a bargaining chip for future dealings with the material-hungry Xuan Ming.

The final lot was announced: Red Beauty Theater, a prime estate near the imperial palace. Starting bid—30,000 taels, increments of 5,000. Chu Fan instantly bid 35,000.

Guan Yu had anticipated this. “40,000,” he countered, drawing every eye. Miss Jiang and Chu Fan stared in disbelief—this newcomer threatened Chu Fan’s long-sought ambition.

The auctioneer crowed, “The generous donor of the Dragon Pearl bids 40,000!”

Murmurs swirled. Why would an outsider vie for this overpriced property? Chu Fan had painstakingly saved to claim his theater’s home, refusing Miss Jiang’s aid to avoid Princess Chang’s scorn. Now, this enigmatic Wan Hong jeopardized everything.

**Chapter 4775: Misunderstanding**

“What is Wan Hong’s aim?” Chu Fan muttered. Miss Jiang shared his confusion. The theater’s value lay in its association with Chu Fan’s success—its owner had inflated prices precisely to exploit his desperation.

Chu Fan’s pride clashed with practicality. Acquiring the estate would cement his standing, yet Wan Hong’s intervention reeked of sabotage. Was he Princess Chang’s pawn? The timing was too perfect.

As Guan Yu stood firm, spectators buzzed. His boldness radiated calculated ambition—a newcomer flaunting wealth to carve status among the elite. For Guan Yu, the estate wasn’t mere property—it was a stepping stone into the capital’s power circles, whatever the cost.
