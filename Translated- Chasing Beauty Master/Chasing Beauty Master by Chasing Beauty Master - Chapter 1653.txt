“Actually, Wang Jun felt the same way. After purchasing crossbow bolts, Guan Yu arrived at Tiger Head Peak’s main hall to submit the roster. The list handed to Xuan Ming clearly listed only a few names: Wang Jun, Siqi, Ling Su, and Lin Chen. At the end, he had added a note requesting Xuan Ming assign him at least twenty more capable individuals.

Guan Yu believed that in a place like the desert, having more people would undoubtedly be advantageous—they could support one another. With fewer hands, any danger would fall solely on his shoulders.

Xuan Ming glanced at the list, surprised Guan Yu had selected both Ling Su and Lin Chen. He knew of their past friction with Guan Yu but hadn’t expected such lingering resentment.

‘Guan Yu,’ Xuan Ming began, ‘must both Ling Su and Lin Chen go? You know Tiger Head Peak currently has only these two outstanding disciples. Sending both would leave us appearing… depleted.’

‘Master, Tiger Head Peak has many disciples. Their absence shouldn’t pose an issue, especially with no ongoing conflicts. Moreover, the desert is fraught with peril. I chose them precisely for their capabilities. Sending two elites from Tiger Head Peak, then recruiting the rest from other peaks, avoids accusations of stinginess, no?’

Xuan Ming had no rebuttal. Guan Yu was right—greater dangers demanded stronger companions. After a pause, he asked, ‘Have you spoken to them? Do they agree to join you?’

In Xuan Ming’s view, Ling Su and Lin Chen were shrewd; aware of their discord with Guan Yu, they’d likely refuse. If they declined, he wouldn’t force them—they were his prized disciples, after all.

Guan Yu smiled. ‘I’ll show them the roster. With over twenty participants, there should be no issue. Besides, they’ll surely agree. This concerns Yunqing Sect’s greater good. They’ll want to contribute.’

‘And Wang Jun?’ Xuan Ming pressed. ‘Is he joining you again? Won’t it exhaust him?’

‘He sought me out himself. He’d rather face danger than languish idly at Yunqing Sect,’ Guan Yu replied.

‘Very well,’ Xuan Ming conceded. ‘Shall I select the remaining disciples?’

Guan Yu nodded. ‘Yes, Master. Assign a few from each peak. Since the mission is perilous, no single peak should bear all losses. Distributing the risk prevents grievances. Once prepared, we’ll depart.’

‘I’ll arrange it. By tonight, you’ll have twenty. Rest assured—this is crucial. I’ll ensure each peak sends capable disciples.’

‘Thank you, Master.’ Guan Yu added, ‘I’ll inform Ling Su and Lin Chen myself. I saw them outside earlier.’

‘Go then. If they refuse, send them to me. At least one will accompany you.’ Xuan Ming sought to reassure Guan Yu—Ling Su and Lin Chen’s formidable cultivation would bolster the team’s safety.

Outside, Ling Su and Lin Chen lingered, scheming. Approaching, Guan Yu spotted Siqi inside—explaining their fixation.

‘Greetings, senior brothers! What occupies you here?’ Guan Yu called loudly, alerting Siqi to their presence.

Ling Su and Lin Chen glared but dared not act, fearing Guan Yu’s strength.

‘Guan Yu,’ Lin Chen sneered, ‘even as a Tiger Head disciple, you can’t roam freely without permission.’

**Chapter 4323: The Importance of Ideas**

‘You’re stunning,’ Guan Yu remarked bluntly, turning to Siqi.

Blushing, Siqi fidgeted in her new attire—a first for her. The dress revealed her calves, a daring departure from convention.

While others gaped, Wang Jun chuckled. ‘Guan Yu, your creation has captivated everyone. Why not design a skirt with meters of fabric? Even more striking!’

‘Impractical. This allows ease of movement,’ Guan Yu replied.

Siqi’s delight was evident. The dress accentuated her beauty, its sleeves cropped to her forearms and hemline daringly short. Her porcelain skin mirrored the gown’s ivory hue.

Lin Chen gaped, drooling. ‘Magnificent…’

Guan Yu nodded. ‘Beauty enhanced by the dress—though the hairstyle lacks refinement. A simple high ponytail clashes.’

He resolved to restyle her hair, despite lacking modern tools. Undoing her ponytail, he let her raven tresses cascade. With Wang Jun’s aid, he wove intricate braids, pinned back with a cloth ribbon. The result—a blend of elegance and edge—left the crowd awestruck.

‘Guan Yu,’ the elderly Lu Shouzuo marveled, ‘you transform beauty into timeless art. Women age, yet your hands preserve their youth.’

Wang Jun smiled ruefully. Though she could surpass Guan Yu’s skills, she hadn’t conceived such innovations. Siqi’s metamorphosis—mundane in modern China—here redefined aesthetics.

Regret flickered in Wang Jun. Only now did she grasp feminine allure’s power—a realm forever beyond her grasp. ‘Exquisite,’ she murmured. ‘In my past life, I’d have kissed you.’

Lin Chen, wiping drool, seethed. ‘How did he devise this?’

Ling Su whispered, ‘He’s winning Siqi’s favor. We must retaliate.’

‘Patience,’ Lin Chen growled. ‘Our chance will come.’

**Chapter 4324: Breaking Through**

Preparations complete, Guan Yu addressed the team: ‘After descending, we’ll fly directly to Qujiang City.’

En route, Guan Yu avoided Siqi, letting her fly alongside Wang Jun and A’Ze.

‘Surprised Xiao Zhi stayed behind,’ Wang Jun remarked. ‘Elder Zheng must’ve insisted.’

A’Ze nodded. ‘They argued fiercely. Xiao Zhi craves adventure, but Elder Zheng fears the desert’s dangers.’

‘Wise,’ Guan Yu said. ‘Xiao Zhi should focus on Du Bingyan—marriage would please Elder Zheng.’

A’Ze pouted. ‘Why wasn’t I invited last time?’

‘We traveled incognito,’ Guan Yu explained. ‘Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi posed as my children.’

‘Xiao Zhi said it was harrowing—fighting nightly, killing dozens.’

‘True,’ Wang Jun said. ‘Guan Yu’s Soulfall Blade turned crimson with blood—yet later, it absorbed the stains.’

Guan Yu recalled the anomaly—the blade’s engravings devouring blood. He’d meant to investigate but forgotten.

In Qujiang City, Guan Yu tasked Lin Chen with finances, offering him deputy leadership.

‘Why me?’ Lin Chen sneered.

‘As Yunqing’s rising star, you command respect,’ Guan Yu said, ignoring Ling Su’s scowl.

Ling Su interjected, ‘If incompetent, relinquish command!’

‘The role is mine by Master’s decree,’ Guan Yu replied, handing Lin Chen the purse. ‘You’ll manage expenditures.’

Lin Chen hesitated, flattered yet wary. Ling Su fumed, excluded from authority.

Thus, tensions simmered as the group braced for the desert’s trials, alliances and grudges intertwining beneath the arid horizon.
