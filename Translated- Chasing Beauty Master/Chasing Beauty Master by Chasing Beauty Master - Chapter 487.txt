Before the words could fully leave her lips, the gray-clad men flanking her struck the back of her head, rendering her unconscious. Aimi and Luoxi paled with alarm.

The Blackwater Mercenary Corps—one of the Ten Great Mercenary Groups within the Dark Mercenary Alliance—was notorious across the lands.

"That voice... it's familiar. Kaili—it must be Kaili! She must have come looking for me. This is all my fault for sneaking out to follow you." Aimi's small face flushed with guilt as she wrung her hands.

Luoxi, too consumed by anxiety to comfort her, felt sweat drenching her palms. "We must save Kaili. We can't let her fall into the Blackwater Corps' hands."

Yet how could they manage it? Between them, Aimi was a Junior Elemental Archer—equivalent to a Junior Sword Master—while Luoxi, a novice mage, barely matched a Senior Swordsman's prowess. The gray-clad men across from them likely possessed Senior Swordsman strength, and the blue-robed leader's power eluded Luoxi's perception entirely. He radiated an aura surpassing even a Senior Sword Master.

Survival alone seemed precarious, let alone rescuing Kaili. Luoxi's heart sank. Even with the Blue Moon Demon Wolf's Junior Sword Master-level strength, they stood no chance. Wait—they still had Guanyu! Remembering his enigmatic demeanor, Luoxi clung to a flicker of hope.

The blue-robed leader, observing their prolonged silence, seemed to sense their weakness. Hearing the captive elf's cries, his eyes gleamed at the prospect of two additional elf maidens. Three beauties would fetch no small fortune!

Exchanging a covert signal with his men, he led their advance. Guanyu remained motionless, eyes shut, while the Blue Moon Demon Wolf snarled low, tension thickening like storm clouds.

**Chapter 1233: Tremble, Mortals**

Luoxi edged backward, pulling Aimi with her as the demon wolf retreated step by step. The enemy, now certain of their identities, grew bolder. Fearing the elf maidens might flee, two gray-clad henchmen dragged the revived Kaili forward. Gagged and bound, she could only whimper helplessly, tear tracks glistening on her porcelain cheeks—a sight to wrench any heart.

"Elven friends, stay awhile," the blue-robed man called, gesturing to Kaili. "You recognize this one, no?"

"Release Kaili, you vile dark mercenaries!" Aimi shouted, face crimson with rage. Luoxi nocked an arrow, poised to loose it at the slightest provocation.

"Now, now—let's avoid rash actions." The leader smirked. "My men might accidentally mar this beauty's flawless skin." A gray-clad thug pressed a dagger to Kaili's throat, its edge dimpling her pearlescent flesh.

Kaili thrashed desperately, oblivious to the crimson threads blooming at her neck. Her tear-filled eyes pleaded with her friends to flee.

Reluctantly lowering her bow, Luoxi silently begged, *Guanyu, wake up! I'll even call you 'husband' if you save us now...*

As if hearing her plea, Guanyu's brow twitched. His hand absently squeezed something soft.

"You lecherous dragon—how dare you grope there?!" Luoxi flushed scarlet, pinching his waist in retaliation.

"Hiss—!" Guanyu jerked awake, his romantic interlude shattered by searing pain. "Damn women and their knack for finding soft spots—universal across worlds, I see!"

With the enemy closing in, Guanyu reluctantly released Luoxi's warmth. Flipping gracefully from the wolf's back, he landed with Olympic-worthy flair, basking in the stunned silence before feigning shyness. "Now now, don't stare—I might blush."

The absurdity shattered the tension. Luoxi and Aimi burst into giggles, their fears momentarily dispelled. Across the clearing, the mercenaries gaped in apoplectic frustration.

"Who the hell are you, interrupting our business?!" A narrow-eyed thug barked.

The blue-robed leader remained wary. "State your name, stranger. The Blackwater Corps handles its affairs—stand aside."

"Blackwater Corps? Never heard of 'em." Guanyu yawned.

The thug bristled, but his leader raised a hand. "We rank among the Dark Mercenary Alliance's Ten Great Corps. Our captain, Blackwater, sits on the Alliance's council. Insult us at your peril."

"Enough! Leave the elf and scram."

Rage flashed in the leader's eyes. "So you choose opposition? Know this—none who cross Blackwater live to regret it."

"Guanyu, be careful!" Luoxi whispered. "They specialize in assassinations—their combat experience—"

Squeezing her trembling hand, Guanyu grinned. "Today, Blackwater runs clear. Witness cultivation's might—tremble, mortals!"

As Guanyu spouted nonsense, Luoxi's gaze softened. *If he saves Kaili... calling him 'husband' might not be so bad.*

"Wolf! Guard them—or you're stew meat!" The demon wolf obediently herded the elves backward.

"So be it!" The leader barked. "Form the Blackwater Sword Array!"

Twelve gray-clad men encircled their leader, charging as one.

Guanyu scoffed. "A 'sword array'? Cultivation arrays use multiples of nine—this pathetic imitation merely funnels power to one. Amateur hour."

"Beware!" Luoxi cried. "The array boosts his strength tenfold—from Senior Sword Master to Mid-Level Grand Sword Master!"

Guanyu waved dismissively as the empowered leader lunged, blade blazing.

*Meridians still healing... can't overexert.* Channeling elemental energy into his eyes, Guanyu's pupils flashed like gemstones. The leader recoiled, vision blurred—

—And began savagely hacking at his own men, who stood dumbly awaiting slaughter.

The elves stared, slack-jawed. Luoxi swelled with pride.

**Chapter 1234: Roasted Mole Rats**

Regret flooded the leader as his men fell. Never in hundreds of battles had he faced such helplessness.

"What sorcery is this?! Who are you?!"

"Die ignorant, fool." Guanyu's chilling tone sent shivers through friend and foe alike.

Seizing Kaili as hostage, the leader roared, "If I can't kill you, this beauty dies with me!"

As his blade plunged toward Kaili's chest—

—The Blue Moon Demon Wolf lunged, severing his arm mid-swing. A energy bolt from Guanyu finished him.

"Pity. Could've interrogated him." Guanyu patted the wolf. "Good boy."

The rescued elves tended to Kaili, who gazed at Guanyu with awe.

"Big Sister Kaili, he's amazing!" Aimi chirped. "Luoxi calls him 'husband'!"

Kaili's cheeks colored at the term's implied intimacy but held her tongue—this dragon-man's favor could benefit their entire clan.

"We must flee," Luoxi urged. "These were mere foot soldiers. Next encounter won't be so easy."

Mounting the overburdened wolf, the group raced through darkening woods. By nightfall, they'd halved the distance to Elvenwood.

"We rest here," Kaili declared at a clearing.

"Here? Not a cave?" Guanyu asked.

Aimi giggled. "Silly—elves don't sleep in caves!"

Kaili pointed to glowing violet eyes in nearby bushes—scores of lowly mole rats. "Their presence means no higher beasts prowl here."

Impressed, Guanyu built a fire and skewered rodents. The elves recoiled at first but soon eyed the sizzling meat with covert hunger.

"Hungry, ladies?" Guanyu teased, savoring their conflicted expressions.
