“But he wouldn’t let her obtain a single tael of silver. Without silver in hand, even if she wanted to flee, where could she go? With no money, escaping becomes impossible. The old master aimed to control this, forbidding her from venturing out to buy things himself, all to keep her tethered here. That’s why he did this.

**Chapter 4470: How to Handle This**

Even if he favored her, the old master felt such a dangerous person could no longer remain by his side. Keeping someone so perilous nearby risked her poisoning him with wine one day and dumping his corpse in a desolate burial ground.

‘How deeply disappointing,’ the old master declared coldly. ‘I treated you so well, yet you betrayed me behind my back. Now, at this critical juncture, you still lie! The Yunqing Sect disciples would never fabricate such matters. Explain yourself! And those valuables in your bundle—where did they come from?’

His heart had turned to ice. He resolved to wash his hands of this affair. Let the Yunqing Sect decide her fate. Since they had come knocking, he could no longer shield her.

‘Gentlemen,’ he addressed the sect members, ‘I’ve grasped the situation. I shall not interfere. Her audacity nearly cost your junior brother his life—this enrages me as well. Handle her as you see fit. I relinquish all responsibility.’

Upon hearing this, Shi Zhenxiang fell to her knees in terror, begging for mercy. This wouldn’t do—she knew the Yunqing disciples wouldn’t spare her. Their righteous facade masked cruel intentions.

She had believed her coquettish charms would sway the old master to her defense. Never had she imagined he’d resolve to cast her out.

Glaring at Guanyu, Shi Zhenxiang spat, ‘I returned your silver! You blocked my escape under pretense of discussion, but clearly plotted my downfall!’

Guanyu remained unmoved. This viper-hearted woman played the victim, yet her murderous nature couldn’t be concealed. To drug a man, abandon him in frozen burial grounds—such actions revealed lethal intent. Any ordinary person would perish from cold or terror.

‘Naturally you must settle this affair,’ Guanyu replied indifferently. ‘As for your fate—that’s no concern of mine.’

Ling Su approached, frustration evident. ‘She returned everything? She stole over two hundred taels of silver and a five-hundred-tael note from Lin Chen. Did she surrender it all?’

‘Correct,’ Guanyu nodded. ‘I intercepted her escape south of town. She yielded the silver then.’

Ling Su grimaced—Guanyu always seized opportunities first. Unwilling to leave empty-handed, he pressed, ‘That silver belongs to Lin Chen, who now lies gravely wounded. His mental state deteriorates, and this delay hampers our plans. How shall we resolve this?’

The old master shook his head resolutely. ‘Handle your affairs as you will. Her destiny is her own now.’

‘That won’t suffice,’ Guanyu countered. ‘Though you now reject her, she acted as your wife. You bear responsibility for her deeds. To abandon her thus shows utter heartlessness.’

‘What more can I do?’ The old master’s voice broke. ‘Her atrocities surpass bandits’ cruelty! I indulged her every whim, yet she betrayed me with wanton treachery. What use is such a woman?’

His firm stance surprised them—he truly meant to sever ties.

Ling Su interjected, ‘My junior brother lies broken. Her actions caused severe injury, mental trauma, and critical delays. We demand compensation.’

‘Indeed,’ another disciple added. ‘Lin Chen requires costly treatment. Our wasted time merits recompense.’

Shi Zhenxiang stood desolate. Flight proved impossible—her parents remained in town. ‘Name your price,’ she resigned.

Ling Su feigned propriety. ‘As upright sect members, we’ll demand reasonable compensation. The sum must be justifiable.’

‘Fifty taels at least,’ one suggested. ‘Lin Chen suffers terribly.’

‘Eighty!’ another argued. ‘The venom drained his spiritual energy. He nearly died!’

Ling Su glared at their naivety. These fools squabbled over crumbs when fortunes lay within reach.

Guanyu remained silent, content to let them negotiate. Ling Su finally declared, ‘Two hundred taels. Her crimes extend beyond Lin Chen—she’s stolen from countless victims. As righteous cultivators, we should—’

‘Two hundred? Highway robbery!’ Shi Zhenxiang shrieked. Her bundle contained treasures, but this demand reeked of banditry.

Ling Su’s smile turned predatory. ‘Refuse, and we’ll escort you to Yunqing Sect for disciplinary judgment. Who knows what punishments await?’

‘You threaten me?’ She jutted her chin. ‘Take me then! I’d rather face judgment than pay extortion.’

The bluff faltered—Ling Su hadn’t anticipated her defiance. Guanyu intervened, ‘Very well. Ling Su, dispatch two men to escort her and Lin Chen back. Let the sect elders decide.’

Panic flashed across Shi Zhenxiang’s face. Yunqing’s distant headquarters meant weeks of travel—and uncertain fate. ‘Two hundred is impossible! You’d bleed me dry!’

Guanyu moderated, ‘Let’s compromise. One hundred taels.’ His gaze challenged Ling Su to refuse.

Grudgingly, Ling Su acquiesced. Shi Zhenxiang rummaged through her bundle, shielding its contents. With trembling hands, she produced a hundred-tael note.

**Chapter 4471: My Decision**

‘Consider this settled,’ Guanyu declared. At the inn, Lin Chen remained bedridden—his snakebitten leg requiring days of treatment.

When a junior disciple reported the silver’s recovery, Lin Chen groaned. ‘Guanyu has it now? My hidden funds—gone!’

The disciple whispered, ‘Elder Brother Ling Su witnessed your... compromised state last night. He testified about the woman’s scheme.’

‘He SPIED on me?’ Lin Chen’s injured leg jerked painfully. ‘That bastard let me suffer!’ Rage warred with helplessness—he’d need to bide his time for vengeance.

**Chapter 4472: Never Mention This Again**

‘Enough,’ Lin Chen growled. ‘Speak no more of this.’ His mind churned—exposed embezzlement, Ling Su’s betrayal, impending punishment from Sect Leader Xuanming...

At dawn, a disciple delivered a small purse. ‘Elder Brother Guanyu left this for your convalescence. We depart shortly—you’ll return to Yunqing alone when healed.’

Lin Chen stared bleakly at the coins. His grand plans lay in ruins, victims of lust and greed.”
