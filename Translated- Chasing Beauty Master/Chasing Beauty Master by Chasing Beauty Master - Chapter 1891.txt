“However, if we were to destroy or discard it outright, that would be a great pity. After all, this counts as a treasure – such exquisitely crafted items are rarely found outside. Let this old minister perform a favor by gifting it to Your Highness, the Second Prince.”

Upon hearing Chancellor Li’s words, the Second Prince’s heart swelled with delight. He hadn’t expected the chancellor to be so astute in reading intentions and adapting swiftly.

Earlier, the Second Prince had deliberately intimidated Chancellor Li, harboring this very scheme from the start. The moment he had laid eyes on the chancellor’s dragon-turtle statue upon entering, he had coveted it. All the talk of potential extermination of clans had been mere threats to pressure him.

After all, the severity of the matter could swing either way. By frightening the chancellor, the Second Prince aimed to claim the dragon-turtle.

This dragon-turtle, indeed a Western auspicious symbol, was said to bring perpetual luck once consecrated. However, the Second Prince knew such statues were typically carved from wood. Rarely did one encounter such extravagance – a massive lump of gold meticulously sculpted into a lifelike masterpiece.

The prince had wagered that intimidating Chancellor Li might compel him to relinquish the treasure. While others might be deemed unworthy of possessing such an artifact, the Second Prince stood as an exception.

“Chancellor Li is most thoughtful,” the Second Prince remarked, concealing his glee beneath a composed facade. “In truth, this object will forever remain a threat to you. Displaying it here is akin to housing a bomb in your study – it could detonate at any moment. By the time it explodes, it would be too late for regrets.”

“Very well. Since Chancellor Li insists, I shall reluctantly accept this gift,” the prince declared solemnly. “You may dispatch servants to deliver the dragon-turtle to my residence immediately.”

The Second Prince feared the chancellor might reconsider. The statue’s value was immense – not only as a master artisan’s work but also for its sheer weight in gold. He couldn’t risk waiting until his return; having it transported directly to his estate would cement ownership.

Chancellor Li, surprised by the prince’s swift acceptance, ventured: “Your Highness claims this item defiles imperial dignity and cannot remain. Would it not be better for this old minister to destroy it?”

This counter arose from lingering unease. Though parting with such a priceless treasure pained him, the chancellor feared endless repercussions. Should complications arise later, the Second Prince could easily implicate him as the source. The statue would become permanent leverage, and with the prince being the Emperor’s son, blame would inevitably fall on Chancellor Li. Destruction seemed safer.

The Second Prince immediately objected, turning sharply: “What? Chancellor Li, do you grudge me this trifle? Setting aside its nature, my taking it preserves your life – this you should clearly understand.”

“Moreover,” he continued, “as a prince, I cannot retain such imperial-defaming objects. I’ll have it disposed of properly. Given its apparent value, I’ll arrange its sale in the Western regions. We’ll split the proceeds equally – how does that suit you?”

**Chapter 4970: Malicious Intent**

The prince’s proposal was pure deception – no silver would ever be shared. Once obtained, he intended to keep the treasure. Even if forced to sell, not a coin would reach the chancellor.

Chancellor Li found this plausible. Destroying such finery seemed wasteful, and selling might yield substantial returns. “As Your Highness commands,” he acquiesced. Surviving court politics required constant vigilance – a misstep could doom both him and his family.

Though inwardly bleeding, the chancellor ordered servants to deliver the dragon-turtle. The Second Prince, exhilarated by this effortless gain, imagined plundering more treasures from Li’s estate.

Having served as first-rank chancellor for years, Li must have amassed considerable wealth. Known for hoarding gifts rather than giving, he’d never offered the prince presents despite regular favors. The prince, covetous of all treasures, now viewed Li with newfound respect.

Earlier, Li had presented the Emperor with a peerless white gem for longevity – likely one-of-a-kind. If he possessed such rarities, more must lie hidden. His habitual poverty claims and shabby official robes had been mere pretense – beneath lurked substantial wealth.

The prince yearned to explore Li’s mansion for more prizes but needed plausible pretext. Abrupt demands would appear too brazen.

“This is my first visit to Chancellor Li’s estate,” the prince mused. “Your lavish study suggests extraordinary splendor elsewhere. I’d love a full tour – surely surpassing my own residence. Don’t you agree, Minister Qi?”

“Ah?” Startled, Minister Qi stammered: “Y-yes, Your Highness speaks truly.”

“Your Highness jests,” Chancellor Li protested, sweating. “Your sudden visit surely isn’t for admiring these shabby quarters? They pale before your noble palace.”

“Quite right,” the prince chuckled. “Minister Qi and I came primarily to visit and tour your estate – being our first occasion. There’s also... a minor matter requiring your assistance.”

“Command me, Your Highness. This old servant will brave any danger.” Li’s anxiety spiked – a tour might unleash disasters. Already regretting the dragon-turtle’s loss, he feared further depredations. Were these visitors bandits?

While the prince remained composed, Minister Qi grew urgent: “Chancellor Li, we seek your Imperial Guards’ aid regarding the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s predicament.”

“Oh? Elaborate, Minister Qi.”

“You’ve heard of their troubles. As fellow servants under His Highness, we should assist each other. Your guards maintain a contingent at the imperial prison, yes?”

Li’s mind raced, uncertain of their aim but wary. “Indeed, by imperial decree. They support prison guards during emergencies – all elite personnel.”

“Precisely,” Qi pressed. “With the Embroidered Uniform Guard banned from the prison, our captured agents remain inside.”

“You expect me to rescue them? Impossible!” Li exclaimed. “My men only reinforce security. They won’t intervene in prisoner affairs.”

“Misapprehending, Chancellor. We require them not for rescue... but execution.”

Li started, glancing at the prince. Killing their own? However distasteful aiding Qi might be, this exceeded expectations.

The Second Prince explained: “Don’t be shocked. Circumstances force us to eliminate loose ends. Better they die than risk betrayal.”

Understanding dawned on Li. With the Crown Prince investigating, any evidence or testimony from the prisoners could doom Minister Qi. Though Qi and Li shared no friendship, their alliance under the Second Prince necessitated mutual protection. Losing the Embroidered Uniform Guard to rivals would weaken their faction.

“Minister Qi,” Li queried, “I heard those agents were rigorously trained – loyal unto death. You’d truly eliminate them?”

“Alas, necessity dictates,” Qi sighed. “Cultivating such operatives takes years. But retaining them risks exposure.”

“Surely the Crown Prince lacks such capability?” Li countered. “That fool couldn’t extract secrets from stones.”

“You underestimate the situation,” Qi grimaced. “The Crown Prince gained this investigation through Princess Chang’s influence. While the prince himself is inept, the princess is shrewd.”

“Her intervention merely repays his rescue of Princess Jiang Xin,” Li dismissed. “She won’t meddle further – as His Highness knows.”

The Second Prince interjected: “We thought similarly, but today the Crown Prince visited Marshal Jiang Yuan’kai’s residence, then sought Wan Hong at Fortune Inn. Afterwards, he raided the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s headquarters.”

“So Jiang Yuan’kai and Wan Hong support him?” Li feigned concern while secretly relishing Qi’s distress.

“Hadn’t the Emperor confirmed your agents were impostors? Why raid their base?”

“Doubtless Jiang or Wan advised him,” Qi fretted. “Initially, I feared nothing – the Crown Prince’s incompetence ensured no breakthroughs. But those two advisors demand caution.”
