Xuanming said, “Take this with you. Since Guanyu has instructed you to return immediately, do not delay any longer. Set off now.” He handed Lin Chen a cloth pouch. Upon receiving it, Lin Chen deliberately peeked inside and found several silver notes.

There were two notes of five hundred taels each, totaling one thousand taels. *This should be more than enough,* Lin Chen thought. Even after repaying the two hundred taels he owed, eight hundred would remain, sufficient for everyone’s needs.

Truthfully, the gold Lin Chen had lost and the two hundred taels in debt were insignificant to the Cloud Azure Sect—mere pocket change. Yet he hadn’t expected Xuanming to hand over the money so readily. Clearly, the matter was urgent, and delays were unacceptable.

“Understood, Master. I’ll return at once to regroup with the others,” Lin Chen replied.

Xuanming then posed the same question as the Lu Division Head: “The travel funds were originally under Guanyu’s care. How did they end up with Ling Su? Was Guanyu unaware?”

Lin Chen had anticipated this. His answer remained unchanged: “With over twenty people on the journey, Guanyu’s capacity was stretched. He deemed me reliable and appointed me deputy leader, entrusting all funds to my care.

“The fault lies with my carelessness. During our rest one night, Ling Su—who shared my room—stole the entire sum while I slept. He gambled it all away and even incurred an additional two hundred taels in debt. Without funds, we couldn’t proceed. Thus, Guanyu sent me to seek your aid.”

Xuanming nodded. “Do not blame yourself. You’ve done well. If Guanyu trusts you, fulfill your role as deputy leader. Work together to retrieve the Eight-Sided Drum Manual.”

“This disciple swears to fulfill your expectations and complete the mission,” Lin Chen declared with a bow.

“Good. I trust you. Any other needs? Any troubles during the journey?”

“None. The journey proceeded smoothly without hindrance.”

As Xuanming retreated to his chamber, Lin Chen nearly vibrated with excitement. *With this sum, who’d dare look down on me now?*

Calculating silently, he decided five hundred taels would suffice. Repaying the two hundred to the gambling den left three hundred for travel expenses. The remaining five hundred? *Mine to keep.*

After all, once the mission succeeded and Xuanming obtained the manual, such trivial sums would hardly matter.

**Chapter 4409: A Fine Game**

At dawn the next day, Guanyu estimated Lin Chen’s return. True to his prediction, Lin Chen arrived in Liaozhou City, though exhaustion lined his face.

Half-asleep on horseback during the journey, he now felt invigorated. He headed straight to the bustling gambling den and knocked on Zou Xiaoyu’s door.

“Enter,” a man’s voice answered. Puzzled, Lin Chen stepped inside to find a middle-aged stranger.

“Where’s Zou Xiaoyu?”

“Who are you? State your business.”

Unbeknownst to Lin Chen, Zou Xiaoyu—after learning of her father’s fate from Guanyu—had departed for the capital with Boss Zhou to confirm Third Captain’s death. Impatient, she’d left the previous evening, leaving her duties to this replacement.

“I’ve come to repay a debt,” Lin Chen declared haughtily, disappointed his planned theatrics were wasted.

“Her whereabouts are unclear. Hand the silver to me. Your name?”

“Lin Lingsu. Two hundred taels. Perhaps I’ll wait for her return—”

“She won’t return soon. Repay now.”

After fruitless searches for the name, the man frowned. “No record exists. Are you certain?”

“Absolutely. I’ll return when she’s here.” As Lin Chen turned to leave, two familiar enforcers entered.

“Borrowing again?” one sneered.

“Repaying,” Lin Chen retorted, brandishing his pouch. “See this?”

“The debt’s forgiven. Boss Zhou’s orders. Leave before we make you.”

*Forgiven?* Lin Chen masked his surprise. *Guanyu’s influence truly runs deep.* “Very well. Farewell.”

His fabricated records already destroyed, Lin Chen exited, elated. From debtor to wealthy man—what a transformation!

The den’s clamor tempted him. Approaching a dice table, he recognized the shrill-voiced woman and her colluding dealer. “You two play quite the game,” he mocked.

Their faces paled. Though lacking proof, Lin Chen pressed on: “Scheming together daily—ever fear lightning?”

Patrons turned, eyes burning. The woman spat back, “Watch your tongue, liar! Leave or bleed!”

Lin Chen raised his voice: “Three nights ago, I saw them splitting profits! She pretends to win, but loses to the dealer—all a ruse! Drive them out! Make them return our silver!”

The crowd erupted. “Thieves!” “Return our money!” Chairs splintered as chaos spread.

Lin Chen grinned. *Serves you right for ruining me.*

“That troublemaker!” A guard pointed. Thugs lunged, but Lin Chen—despite his bulk—twisted free. “Blackmailers! Prince’s backing lets you rob us?”

As brawls erupted, he slipped toward the vault—only to find armed guards. A drunk’s failed charge proved their skill. *Best retreat,* Lin Chen decided, vanishing into the streets.

**Chapter 4410: In High Spirits**

Lin Chen strolled away, buoyant. The debt vanished, mischief accomplished—what joy! Now to find Guanyu and depart. Let the den burn; no concern of his.

Boss Zhou and Zou Xiaoyu, en route to the capital, remained oblivious. While Zhou tolerated minor scams for profit, this riot exceeded all expectations.

Yet Lin Chen cared not. His path ahead gleamed—wealth secured, troubles behind. For now, contentment reigned.
