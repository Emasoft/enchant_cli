Guan Yu leaned closer, his eyes remaining narrowed as he activated his inspection system. His jaw dropped in astonishment. "Holy hell... there must be at least a thousand of these!"

"Did you expect just one?" Lin Dong retorted irritably. "You think our trip to Yunnan was for nothing?"

"Heh, I just couldn't see them clearly," Guan Yu chuckled apologetically. "Let's get to work. These things are invisible to the naked eye. We can't risk them entering our bodies."

He quickly snapped the small container shut.

Wan Qianshan's recent days had been miserable. Though Guan Yu treated him decently with good food and drink, constant terror gnawed at him - those creatures lurking inside his body might kill him any moment.

But three days later, his anxiety proved unnecessary. The realization turned his face ashen. Those damned spiders had already died in his gut and been excreted. The excruciating abdominal cramps during the process nearly drained the life from him.

Now he understood Guan Yu's deception. As he mentally dismembered his tormentor, the man himself reappeared.

"Wan Qianshan, enjoying your vacation?" Guan Yu grinned.

The captive snorted heavily. "We had an agreement. When will you release me to Taiwan?"

"Release you? Let you regroup and have me chopped into pieces?" Guan Yu's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"Do I dare?" Wan Qianshan shot back bitterly. "With your creatures still inside me? Any betrayal would kill me within days." Even as a captive, he refused courtesy.

"Exactly what you're plotting," Guan Yu sneered. "As for those spiders - impressive digestion you've got there. Even survived expelling them." He clicked his tongue mockingly.

Wan Qianshan's heart raced though his face remained impassive. "Fabricate charges if you will. Just end this if you won't cooperate."

"Cooperate? Of course!" Guan Yu spread his hands. "Taiwan's a juicy cake. I'll stuff myself sick with it."

"Then release me! My prolonged absence risks chaos there," Wan Qianshan threatened.

"Soon," Guan Yu's voice turned icy. "But first, try this special gift from Yunnan - the very thing that made you faint when mentioned."

Fear finally cracked Wan Qianshan's composure. "Don't you dare! I'll never cooperate if you kill me!"

"Your choice ended long ago." In a blur, Guan Yu forced open the man's jaws, emptying thousands of bloodthirsty insects into his mouth.

Choking and clawing at his throat proved futile. "What did you feed me?!" Wan Qianshan roared.

"A local Yunnan delicacy - hematophagous insects. Let me educate you..." Guan Yu explained coldly. "These thousands will thrive in you for seventy years. They won't die like black widows or get excreted. Unless drained completely, they're permanent tenants. Their effects... you'll learn firsthand."

A blood-curdling scream tore through the air as Wan Qianshan crumpled, his body wracked with tenfold agony than before.

"Comfortable?" Guan Yu mocked before his gaze turned flinty. "Remember - you're my puppet now. Manage Taiwan well, and enjoy wealth till death. Cross me, and you'll beg for death's release. Now crawl back to your island."

That night, Feng Xin awoke from prolonged unconsciousness to find only Guan Yu keeping vigil. Bandages swathed her face, leaving only eyes and mouth visible.

"Guan Yu," she rasped weakly upon waking, "bring me a mirror."

"Sis, why...?" He complied despite confusion.

Staring at her reflection, Feng Xin froze before bursting into anguished sobs.

"Ruined..." she whispered desolately.

Chapter 672: Beauty Lies in the Eyes of the Lover

Men adore beauty; women admire handsomeness - humanity's innate love for aesthetics.

Feng Xin's shattered reflection overwhelmed her with anxiety, helplessness, and creeping dread. This disfigurement struck like lightning - unbearable.

Curling into herself, she buried her face in knees as tears flowed. Guan Yu's heart ached watching her.

"Sis, I'll fix this," he vowed softly.

When words failed, he gently unwrapped her bandaged left hand despite her flinch. "Let me prove it."

Meeting his earnest gaze, she reluctantly extended her maimed limb. Once delicate hands now bore grotesque burns across eighty percent surface, though Guan Yu's covert treatments had slightly faded the scars.

"Energy therapy might sting," he warned before channeling azure light from his copper coin artifact. As cooling energy flowed through her arm, Feng Xin gasped at the miraculous relief.

Watching sweat bead on Guan Yu's pale face, her eyes softened with emotion. Whether cured or not, his devotion moved her deeply.

After treatment, examining her improved hand brought astonished joy. "It worked!"

"Told you," Guan Yu smiled weakly. "Traditional qi circulation therapy from an old master."

"You sure it's not TV magic?" she teased weakly.

"Life breeds wonders," he deflected. "Rest now. We'll continue tomorrow."

As he turned to leave, her trembling voice stopped him: "If... if I stay like this... would you...?"

Darkness amplified his firm reply: "You'll always be my most beautiful sister."

Under bandages, Feng Xin smiled through tears. Perhaps love truly blinded flaws.

Chapter 673: The Psychology of a Gambler

Alone in his room, Guan Yu's calm facade crumbled. His bold promise haunted him - fully healing extensive burns seemed impossible through gradual energy therapy.

Chain-smoking failed to soothe his turmoil. Online research revealed only skin grafts and topical treatments - both inadequate for severe burns.

Suddenly inspired, he rushed back to Feng Xin's bedside. Activating his inspection system, azure light enveloped her sleeping form as he desperately sought solutions through his artifact's enhanced capabilities.

Energy drained alarmingly fast, but gambling on breakthrough, he persisted. Sweat poured as mystical currents probed every burned inch...
