“The medicine is ready. This is the Earth Mystical Pellet. Have Senior Sister Zuo take it. Not only will it eradicate her lingering ailments, but it will also consolidate her foundation and nurture her vitality, granting her potential for further breakthroughs.” With a twist of his hand, Guan Yu produced a medicinal vial from thin air. The Earth Mystical Pellet was the Enchantment Sect’s sacred healing medicine—a supreme Golden Core-grade elixir. Each vial contained only one pellet. At the Golden Core level, as long as one wasn’t dead, any injury could be healed.

“With this medicine acquired, Brother Guan... have you obtained the inheritance?” Wang Xiaojun’s eyes flashed with sharp light. He naturally understood the significance of ancient legacies, though he harbored only envy—such opportunities were fated, impossible to predict.

“I’ve indeed received part of the inheritance. Everyone, listen: after I refine this legacy monument, we’ll have only half an hour. The exit lies three li to the east. We must move swiftly when the time comes. Understood?” Guan Yu solemnly relayed the crucial details to the group. Those present were trustworthy, so he saw no need to conceal his gains.

Placing his hand once more upon the legacy monument, golden radiance erupted. The massive stone stele shrank until it condensed into a pinpoint of golden light that vanished into Guan Yu’s glabella. Where the monument had stood, a bottomless pit now yawned.

“Move out!”

Three li meant nothing to cultivators—they traversed the distance in moments. As they passed through, Guan Yu noticed demonic sect members and Yan Qing trailing closely behind.

None were fools. With Guan Yu having obtained the inheritance, following him promised survival.

“Rumble...”

As the group escaped the collapsing space, they turned to see a colossal sinkhole form where the land had been, as though the earth itself had vanished.

“Congratulations on your triumph, Young Master Guan. Should the opportunity arise, do visit our Yin Kui Sect. Lü Wu awaits you~” The Yin Kui Saintess Lü Wu gazed at Guan Yu with practiced allure, her demeanor that of a seductress. Yet her eyes betrayed utter emotional detachment.

“Enough of these third-rate enchantments. Should the occasion arise, I’ll visit your sect. But this matter remains unsettled—the Demon Emperor Sect, heh...” Guan Yu sneered coldly before departing swiftly with his companions.

“Third-rate... Hmph!” Lü Wu’s charming facade fractured into genuine irritation before melting into a blossom-like smile that inexplicably stirred hearts—true mastery of allure lay not in obvious displays, but in subtle manipulation.

“The Yin Kui Saintess’ enchantments dismissed as third-rate? What disgrace to our demonic sects. Sister Lü Wu, shall this humble brother teach that upstart a lesson?” Ren Qiansha materialized ghostlike beside her, oozing obsequiousness.

“The Cult of the Evil God’s leader... You’ve been spectating this whole affair. If you’re so inclined, test him. But hasn’t your sect abandoned cultivation matters to focus on mortal realms? Why appear now?” Lü Wu’s demeanor shifted to icy detachment, restrained allure paradoxically intensifying her charm—true manipulation required no explicit commands, merely subtle suggestion.

“Merely observing Guan Yu’s depths. Next, leave him to me. As for 151 Literature Network? One sentence: update speed surpasses rivals n-fold, fewer ads.” Ren Qiansha’s eyes glinted murderously, crimson light bleeding into his gaze. Lü Wu curled her lip—these heretic cultists were all madmen.

“Upon returning, I’ll convince our master to eliminate him. We assumed Wild Crane Daoist was spent—destined to barely sustain White Cloud Temple’s fortunes for decades before meeting ruin. But this boy’s ancient inheritance changes everything. If he survives, he’ll become our demonic sects’ greatest threat. You two—heed this warning.” Qing Tian departed grim-faced, clearly damaged at his core. Though tensions lingered between them, greater enemies necessitated uneasy alliances.

“The Foundation Consolidation Pill will solidify your dao foundation. Take it with the Tendon Transformation and Marrow Cleansing Pills for complete rebirth. Afterwards, convert your zhenqi to cultivate the Great Demon Subduing Scripture—this will condense true essence. Though your cultivation will appear as early Golden Core, you’ll rival peak Golden Core experts.” Within his consciousness sea, Guan Yu refined his physique under Jingang’s guidance.

Swallowing the pills, Guan Yu assumed meditation posture. Spiritual energy surged violently. Moments later, his body convulsed as tendons and marrow seemed shredded—only for healing currents to instantly rebuild them anew. The cycle repeated endlessly.

Agony akin to internal flaying soon forced Guan Yu to shut his senses, entering trance. Seven perilous hours followed—only the artifact spirit’s vigilance allowed such risk. Awakening, he found himself encased in blackened scabs. The slightest movement shed this carapace, revealing a transcendent physique.

“Flesh perfected, body unified. Master, while unremarkable by ancient standards, your physique is unmatched today.” Jingang danced around Guan Yu as shimmering light, childlike in exuberance.

“This torment yields ‘unremarkable’? Heh. My body now rivals peak Spirit Silence cultivators sans essence. When can I begin the Great Demon Subduing Scripture?” Guan Yu threw a punch—the sonic boom and tiger’s roar confirming supersonic speed. Such flesh defied mortal limits.

“The Great Demon Subduing Scripture is the orthodox method of the Demon Subduing Sect, created by ancient golden immortals. Though our version only reaches Nascent Soul stage, cultivation remains arduous. Temper your body further and refine your spirit. When your essence stagnates, begin conversion. But master—someone urgently seeks you outside.” Jingang explained cheerfully, appreciating Guan Yu’s respectful partnership.

“Brother Guan Yu, my elder brother wishes to meet you.” Ye Qingling’s voice carried complex undertones. The once-carefree girl had matured through recent trials, her feelings toward Guan Yu now tinged with hesitant attraction she couldn’t comprehend.

**Chapter 1167: Secure Internals Before External Affairs**

“Ye Qingfeng arrives timely. Have him await me in the parlor.” Guan Yu noted Ye Qingling’s change but remained unsure how to approach the fifteen-year-old’s budding emotions.

“Brother Ye traveled far—what brings you?” Guan Yu surveyed the fashionably-dressed youth, struggling to reconcile modern attire with cultivator identity. Without introduction, he’d mistake this for a university student.

“Let’s dispense formalities. First, gratitude for saving my sister. Second—assessing your worth as potential brother-in-law. Straight answer: Do you fancy her?” Ye Qingfeng’s bluntness stunned both listeners.

“Well...”

“Yes or no?”

“Yes.” Guan Yu glanced at the crimson-faced girl, acknowledging his genuine, if nascent, feelings.

“Good. Though you’re no saint with multiple women, mutual affection suffices. You’re shameless yet honest—you pass my test.” Ye Qingfeng stroked his sister’s hair. Personally dissatisfied, he prioritized her happiness. “But this is merely my approval. To truly be together, you must prioritize her needs. Now—official business. My father sends me to eliminate traitor Yin Ye, recover Kunlun’s treasure Apricot Yellow Banner, and unite righteous sects against demonic forces. You’re pivotal in both matters.”

**Chapter 1168: Necessity of Strength**

“Regarding Qingling—what conditions apply?” Guan Yu steered back, determined to clarify terms without future constraints.

“Conditions aren’t mine to set. Rest assured—Qingling’s happiness won’t be bargained. Kunlun’s factions are complex. Though Yin Ye was father’s chief disciple, he conspired with rivals. Your master’s past misfortune was unknown to father—Wild Crane won’t oppose your union. Priority now—help me capture Yin Ye.”

“My injuries healed. How may I assist?”

“I’ll track him. You clear the area and prevent escape. The Carefree Sect already exiled Yan Qing—eliminate him on sight.” Ye Qingfeng’s directives were characteristically precise.

After mobilizing Dragon Group to lockdown transportation hubs, Guan Yu coordinated the operation. “My forces await your signal.”

“Heaven and Earth, Qiankun Lend Law—Spirit Butterfly Guide, Manifest!” Ye Qingfeng burned two hairs, their ashes coalescing into a golden butterfly. “This leads to Yin Ye.”

Tracking the butterfly through Chengdu’s suburbs, they arrived at a private winery veiled by detection arrays—evidently a Carefree Sect stronghold.

“Police inspection—summon your manager.” Police vehicles soon arrived. When the manager emerged—Liu Rushu, fallen from youthful arrogance—Guan Yu cut to the chase: “Is Yan Qing here?”

Ye Qingfeng produced a violet-gold token: “By Carefree Sect’s decree—Yan Qing, traitor colluding with demons, is excommunicated. All disciples shall execute him on sight.”

As the sect leader’s holographic edict played, shock rippled through disciples. “Take us to them.”

“They’re in... Master, flee! Kunlun’s—urk!” Liu Rushu’s warning ended abruptly as two figures burst from the compound. Guan Yu and Ye Qingfeng gave chase.

“Elder Brother, cease resistance.” Ye Qingfeng calmly approached Yin Ye, whose golden core flickered ominously. “Planning to detonate? Too late.”

A talisman reduced Yin Ye to helplessness. “You... placed restrictions on me?!”

“Father requires you alive—too many secrets at stake.” Ye Qingfeng’s smile chilled as he restrained the traitor, the first move in Kunlun’s greater purge.
