Guan Yu and Wang Jun could travel directly via sword flight, while the purchased armor and other items could be sent back by carriage. Wang Xiaorong remained here, as Guan Yu's primary purpose was to have her assist Liu Yun and her daughter, fearing unforeseen complications.

Upon returning to Yunqing Sect, Guan Yu first visited Xiao Zhi at Bamboo Peak. Xiao Zhi was overjoyed to see him.

“Guan Yu, what brings you here today?” Xiao Zhi asked.

“I just returned from outside and wanted to check on you,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. “After not seeing you for a few days, you seem to have gained weight—your cheeks look fuller.” Seeing Xiao Zhi in good spirits reassured him.

However, Sect Leader Xiang’s prolonged absence puzzled Guan Yu. Had the leg injury not healed yet? It was time to remove the blood toxin from Xiao Zhi. He resolved to inquire about this with Xuanming at Tiger Head Peak’s main hall later.

“You won’t be staying here much longer,” Guan Yu told Xiao Zhi. “Once Sect Leader Xiang arrives, he’ll purge the blood toxin from your body. You’ll soon be as healthy as anyone else.”

Xiao Zhi sighed deeply. “I shouldn’t have trusted Yan Zhao. Had I listened to you, I wouldn’t have been ambushed or poisoned. I nearly lost my life and almost dragged my father into punishment. This is all my fault.”

“Now you understand?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Think—have I ever deceived you since we met? I considered you a friend, yet you doubted me. Truthfully, that stung a little.”

Xiao Zhi knew Guan Yu’s complaint was lighthearted. The latter had not only aided him personally but also resolved major issues for Xuanzhong Peak.

Seeing Xiao Zhi’s somber expression, Guan Yu grew serious. “Enough brooding. Everyone at Xuanzhong Peak awaits your return—especially A’Ze. The first thing he asks about whenever we meet is your condition. He worries deeply. Don’t lose heart here. Stay strong, and you’ll recover in time.”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “Guan Yu, having brushed with death, I’ve gained clarity. I was naïve and ignorant before—this ordeal exposed my folly. Were it not for you, I’d have met King Yama long ago.”

“None of that gloom.” Guan Yu patted his shoulder. “As my friend, you’ll always be safe while I’m here. But heed this: in this jianghu of schemes and counter-schemes, nothing is absolute. Trust no one completely—not even the Sect Master. Take my words as you will. I’ll say no more.”

In Tiger Head Peak’s grand hall, Xuanming sat elevated, with Guan Yu standing below. “Guan Yu, did you acquire what you sought on your trip?”

“Regrettably, I found none of my desired items,” Guan Yu shook his head. “Perhaps they’re too rare. Though Zhouji City is renowned for materials, most are common. Securing treasures in such haste proved impossible. I merely procured some basics.”

He produced a VIP token from Central Street Auction House. “I’ll frequent this establishment when possible. Fortune might yet smile upon us.”

“I’ve secured master craftsmen—renowned artisans arriving tomorrow with apprentices,” Xuanming said. “Disappoint me not.”

“Though lacking premium materials, the metals I obtained should craft formidable crossbows,” Guan Yu countered. “Their efficacy depends on your artisans’ skill.”

“Their craftsmanship is peerless. Describe your vision, and they’ll realize it. We’re preparing a workshop in the back mountains—ready within days.”

Guan Yu concealed his displeasure. Xuanming’s arrangements felt restrictive, akin to imprisonment. While crossbow production required secrecy, Guan Yu preferred traveling to source materials while refining designs. Yet arguing proved futile—Xuanming prioritized security above all.

“Ordinary materials may yet yield serviceable prototypes,” Guan Yu conceded. “Once functional samples exist, you’ll witness their potential. Equipping the entire sect remains a long-term goal.”

“Excellent. These artisans—the ‘Divine Hands Masters’—craft wonders from wood and metal alike. Tomorrow begins our endeavor.”

“Divine Hands Masters? From Zhenyang Sect?” Guan Yu’s eyebrows rose. The elusive innovation-focused sect rarely interacted with others.

Xuanming smirked. “Indeed—a Zhenyang elder leads them. They’re drawn by curiosity about your crossbow designs. Clever, no?”

“But secrecy? If they replicate our designs...”

“Crucial components will be fabricated separately,” Xuanming interrupted. “Handle sensitive parts yourself. Let them assemble mundane sections.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Precision requires seamless integration. Divided labor risks flaws.”

“Then obscure the purpose! Let them work blind.”

“You already disclosed the crossbow concept to lure them here!”

Xuanming slapped his forehead. “Ah, true! Regardless, we proceed. First, create a working model.”

“We’ll impose confidentiality agreements,” Guan Yu suggested. “Threaten repercussions if designs leak.”

“Adequate. Now, about Sect Leader Xiang...”

Xuanming waved a sleeve. “I mediated your wager, but pressuring a sect leader exceeds my reach. Handle this yourself—I’ll not interfere.”

“Then I’ll confront him directly. Xiao Zhi’s safety takes precedence. Until the blood toxin is purged, I’ll camp at Left Void Peak—even if materials and craftsmen arrive.”

Xuanming sighed. “Very well. I’ll... remind Sect Leader Xiang discreetly.”

The next day, materials arrived. Guan Yu hid the white beast sinews—Xuanming mustn’t glimpse these. At the hall’s entrance, an entourage entered—led by a tanned, grey-bearded elder exuding vitality.

“Elder Wang! Your reputation precedes you.” Guan Yu bowed.

The elder chuckled. “Flattery aside, let’s begin! My students and I crave this challenge.”

As they examined the procured armor, Elder Wang’s eyes lit up. “Extraordinary craftsmanship! These shoulder plates—what alloy is this?”

“Your insight astounds,” Guan Yu replied. “I purchased this relic hoping experts like yourself might decipher its secrets. Shall we dismantle it for study?”

Elder Wang’s grin widened. “Marvelous proposal! Let us unravel history’s mysteries together!”
