“What kind of person Guan Yu truly is, even Elder Dai doesn’t fully understand. She only knows he is deeply cherished by Elder Lu and the Sect Leader. But according to Siqi’s account, only an inner energy cultivator would possess such abilities.”

Elder Dai frowned in contemplation. “Guan Yu came to our sect to study magic, yet he was previously an inner energy cultivator. Could it be…he’s pursuing dual cultivation of magic and martial arts?” At this realization, she exclaimed aloud in astonishment.

Hearing the term “dual cultivation,” Siqi and her fellow disciples exchanged glances, their faces etched with disbelief.

“You all witnessed Guan Yu casting spells afterward, correct?” Elder Dai pressed for confirmation.

“We did, and clearly,” Siqi recalled. “When Elder Xiang moved to attack Guan Yu with formidable magic, I feared for his safety and cast a protective barrier before him. Yet Guan Yu unexpectedly invoked a spell from the Imperial Seal, transforming into a golden figure who shielded me. Elder Xiang’s assault proved utterly ineffective against him.”

Elder Dai nodded. “Precisely. If Guan Yu can wield the Imperial Seal’s magic, it confirms his status as an immortal cultivator. Activating the Imperial Seal requires spiritual energy—without even a trace of it, the artifact cannot be awakened.”

“Then…is Guan Yu truly a dual cultivator?” Xiaotong blurted in amazement.

“All evidence suggests so,” Elder Dai affirmed. “From now on, you must foster good relations with him. Never provoke his displeasure. Understood?”

In truth, Elder Dai had repeatedly emphasized this during their time at Convergence Peak, initially aiming to improve Guan Yu’s impression of Second Only to Wolf. Now, however, her ambitions extended beyond mere recruitment. If Guan Yu indeed mastered dual cultivation, aligning with him became imperative.

Though aware of Guan Yu’s capabilities, Siqi had never seen him in action. That this man who feared heights might conceal such power challenged her previous underestimation. “Master,” she inquired, “how can we conclusively determine his dual cultivation?”

“The proof lies before you. Guan Yu commands inner energy while simultaneously channeling the Imperial Seal’s spiritual power. His dantian harbors both forces—though the precise mechanics elude my understanding.”

Siqi’s respect deepened with this revelation. Elder Dai continued, “No wonder the Sect Leader values him so highly, and why Elder Lu and Xuanming vie for his favor with precious artifacts. As a rare dual cultivator, Guan Yu justifies their lavish investments.”

This realization steeled Elder Dai’s resolve to recruit Second Only to Wolf, however slim the opportunity. She would not relinquish this pursuit.

At Left Void Peak, Elder Xiang’s entourage occupied numerous guest quarters arranged by Tiger Head Peak. Entering Acai’s recovery chamber, he found Wenming present.

“Master,” Wenming greeted with a bow.

“How fares Acai’s condition?” Elder Xiang inquired.

“Grateful for your concern,” Acai replied weakly from his bed. “A head wound with minor bleeding, bruised knees—nothing grave.”

The youth endured lingering pain, though proper treatment had stabilized his injuries.

Elder Xiang sighed. “Why provoke Guan Yu despite the Sect Leader’s warnings? Suspended Peak’s disciples wisely befriended him early. As a dual cultivator, his future influence could eclipse entire peaks. Our enmity may doom Left Void Peak.”

“I refuse to believe some upstart can overthrow us!” Acai protested.

Wenming added, “We merely exchanged words with Suspended Peak disciples. Guan Yu intervened unexpectedly. Acai acted to preserve our dignity.”

“Short-sighted!” Elder Xiang lamented. “While Suspended Peak cultivates alliances, you court disaster. Without the crowd’s interference, even I might have fallen to Guan Yu today.”

Left Void disciples slumped under their master’s unprecedented criticism. The normally protective elder’s despondency revealed profound disappointment.

“Guan Yu’s insolence warranted correction,” Wenming ventured, “but that mysterious mid-tier cultivator accompanying him—how could the Sect Leader permit outsiders? What if they threaten our sect?”

“The Sect Leader’s decision stands,” Elder Xiang deflected. “They don’t reside here—beyond our jurisdiction. Now, explain tomorrow’s Six Peaks Assembly. With Acai incapacitated, how did this conflict begin?”

After Wenming’s account, Elder Xiang focused not on his disciples’ aggression but gasped: “You ingested Guan Yu’s spittle?!”

Acai retched violently, expelling medicinal broth. Elder Xiang’s brow furrowed. “Such humiliation cannot stand! While our provocation was minor, this disgrace demands redress.”

Yet practicality tempered outrage. “Guan Yu remains indispensable to the sect’s prestige. Direct action risks the Sect Leader’s wrath. We must endure—forbid all further conflicts with him.”

Acai seethed at this unprecedented impotence. Wenming proposed subterfuge: “Master, should we eliminate him covertly?”

“Impossible!” Elder Xiang recoiled. “As prime suspects, we’d face relentless investigation. Bide your time—retribution requires patience.”

The disciples exchanged hollow glances. Their once-infallible protector now counseled submission, upending years of swaggering privilege.

Summoned to Tiger Head Peak’s rear chambers, Ling Su faced Xuanming’s interrogation. “I hear you ‘mediated’ tonight’s dispute?”

Ling Su smiled ingratiatingly. “Merely urged restraint when Guan Yu disrespected Elder Xiang.”

“Enough theatrics!” Xuanming slammed the table. “Your provocations escalated tensions. Did my previous warnings mean nothing?”

The elder saw through his protégé’s machinations. Though once indulging Ling Su’s petty tyrannies, Guan Yu’s emergence had altered everything. “Continue this path, and I’ll exile you to Bamboo Forest Peak for discipline!”

Ling Su knelt, crimson-faced. His golden era—when misdeeds transformed into virtues through Xuanming’s favor—had crumbled before Guan Yu’s ascent.

Dawn found Guan Yu and Second Only to Wolf conversing through night. The latter insisted on remaining despite lacking magical aptitude—his body rejected spiritual energy, proving martial and mystical energies mutually exclusive. Guan Yu’s unique constitution, forged when his inner energy seal paradoxically permitted spiritual cultivation, marked him as history’s first dual cultivator since the sect’s founding ancestor.

Though initially reluctant to stay, Guan Yu recognized dual cultivation’s advantages—whether breaching the seal or mastering new powers. Second Only to Wolf’s stubborn companionship eased homesickness, while Xuanming’s mentorship promised unprecedented growth. In this convergence of chance and destiny, Guan Yu’s path diverged from ordinary cultivators, charting a course that could redefine the sect’s legacy.
