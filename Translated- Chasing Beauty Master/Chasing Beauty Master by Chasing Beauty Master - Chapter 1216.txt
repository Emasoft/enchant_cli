Xuanming said, “Guanyu, this Eight Treasures Pagoda was crafted by ancient immortals. Though it cannot be called a divine artifact, among magic tools, it stands as a superior-grade treasure. Ordinary magic tools pale in comparison to its formidable power. I believe that possessing it will greatly smooth your path of immortal cultivation.”

Guanyu stepped forward curiously, eyeing the small pagoda in the elder’s hand. A peculiar energy emanated from it, radiating ripples of golden light. “Grandpa Xuan, may I examine this treasure first?” he asked eagerly.

“Of course. I brought out this Eight Treasures Pagoda precisely to gift it to you,” Xuanming replied, though his heart ached as if pierced by needles.

Grandpa Lu, seated nearby, saw Guanyu’s apparent fondness for the pagoda. Not wanting the youth to easily become the sect leader’s disciple, he interjected firmly, “Guanyu, don’t be hasty. Choosing a magic tool requires careful consideration. For your own good, I must say this Eight Treasures Pagoda isn’t suitable for you.”

Xuanming frowned. “Junior Brother Lu, your objection makes no sense. Since Guanyu has chosen my treasure, why interfere?”

“I’m not obstructing, but this pagoda truly isn’t suited for him,” Lu insisted, his expression suggesting ulterior motives.

“Why unsuitable? Do you reject every treasure I offer? If you can present something superior, do so. Otherwise, hold your tongue,” Xuanming retorted, annoyed by his junior’s interference. Having sacrificed his most prized possession only to face resistance, his patience wore thin.

Grandpa Lu adopted a solemn tone. “Elder Brother Sect Leader, hear me. As a Jiezun expert with sealed cosmic energies within him, Guanyu needs a tool that accommodates both cultivation and combat. Once his seals break and he regains Jiezun strength, he’ll become a dual-cultivation master of magic and martial arts. Your pagoda, though excellent for pure cultivators, would become obsolete. Moreover, since its previous owner perished and it hasn’t been re-bonded, forcing compatibility would be wasteful.”

Producing a sword shrouded in misty aura, Lu continued, “This Ziyang Sword suits a dual-cultivator perfectly. Its spiritual storage rivals your pagoda, while serving as both weapon and magic tool. Observe!”

The blade emerged from an intricately carved scabbard exuding subtle fragrance. Its hilt bore an egg-sized white gem emitting ethereal vapors, the entire weapon a masterpiece of arcane craftsmanship.

“Magnificent!” Guanyu gasped. Xuanming’s eyes widened. “The Ziyang Sword? Junior Brother, when did you acquire this legendary relic?”

Lu smiled faintly. “A century’s search ended when I retrieved it from a beast’s belly—likely swallowed as curiosity. This blade once belonged to the Jade Blood Sect’s matriarch, renowned for annihilating thousands of demonic cultivators a millennium ago.”

Guanyu marveled, “After millennia in a monster’s gut, it still smells fragrant? Incredible!”

“The scent comes from the mystical wood scabbard engraved with cultivation mantras,” Lu explained. “The hilt’s unyielding black metal defies analysis, and the white gem itself is a potent spiritual vessel. However...” He paused meaningfully. “Only its bonded master can unsheathe it.”

“How finicky!” Guanyu remarked, though secretly admiring the ornate weapon. “Why haven’t you claimed it yourself, Grandpa Lu?”

“An aromatic sword ill-suits a centuries-old patriarch,” Lu chuckled. “Besides, I’ve my preferred tools. This deserves someone like you—a future legend.”

Xuanming countered, “If fragrance bothers you, wouldn’t Guanyu face similar ridicule?”

Guanyu interjected, “I rather like the scent. This sword seems mightier than the pagoda.”

“Historically renowned, yes,” Xuanming conceded, “but my pagoda stores more spiritual energy and can seal combat spells within. That sword? A gilded relic—more show than substance.”

“Nonsense!” Lu retorted. “Can your pagoda slash enemies in close combat? This blade serves dual purposes!”

**Chapter 3123: Courting Favor (Part 2)**

As the elders bickered like marketplace hawkers, Guanyu feigned interest in the sword. “Perhaps the Ziyang Sword suits me better.”

Lu beamed through pained eyes, consoling himself that securing a future dual-cultivation guardian justified sacrificing his treasure.

“Wait!” Xuanming waved his sleeve, summoning twenty-seven glowing artifacts that orbited him in four tiers. “Choose any!”

Among them, a golden seal pulsed with imperial majesty. “The Imperial Seal!” Lu exclaimed bitterly. “You refused me this for centuries!”

Xuanming declared, “Guanyu, this Emperor’s Seal surpasses all. Though it pains me, I gift it freely.”

Guanyu grinned slyly. “Grandpa Xuan, I’ve not agreed to be your disciple yet.”

“No matter. Destiny binds us.” Xuanming shot a triumphant glance at Lu, playing the long game of mentorship through lavish gifts.
