“Then how should I thank you?” Du Teng said. It was evident that the other party, knowing he now had a child, had undergone a complete shift in thoughts and attitude, abandoning his original purpose of challenging the mountain.

Zhen Xiang finally relaxed, gazing at Du Teng as she said, “Ah Teng, if possible, I hope you’ll come back with me now. Our child is still waiting for us at home.”

Du Teng hesitated before deciding, “My brother can help me. Let’s wait two more days. By the evening of the day after tomorrow, I’ll definitely accompany you home. Trust me, alright?” Zhen Xiang didn’t speak but leaned into Du Teng’s embrace, savoring the moment.

Seeing this, Guan Yu nudged Wang Xiaorong, signaling for them to leave and not disturb the couple’s reunion.

“Hey, brothers! Don’t go!” Du Teng called out from behind.

“We don’t want to intrude on your time together. You two catch up—we’ll take our leave,” Wang Xiaorong said with a laugh.

**Chapter 4131: Unmatched Skill**

Du Teng, holding Zhen Xiang’s hand, caught up to them and said earnestly, “We’re old flames—no need for ‘alone time.’ Thank you both for your advice earlier. After all this time, how about we head to the fire hall for a meal?”

“Yes, we’d like to thank you both properly,” Zhen Xiang added, her tears now forgotten as she smiled and removed her veil, soaked through from crying.

Seeing Zhen Xiang’s true face, Guan Yu noted that while she couldn’t be called stunning, her features were refined and pleasant. Age had softened her beauty, but in her youth, she must have been far lovelier.

As the four walked toward the fire hall, Guan Yu asked, “Brother Du, that person from Black Blood Ridge who harmed you two years ago—did you ever learn his name?”

“When I saved him, he said his name was Yan Zhao. Hmph! I’ll never forget him. He’s the reason I suffered so long, the reason my family fell apart! If I get the chance, I’ll make him pay!”

Zhen Xiang added coldly, “That heartless wretch! You saved him, yet he betrayed you. He deserves death!”

“But perhaps we’ll never get that chance. A year ago, I sought revenge, but later I heard Black Blood Ridge was destroyed—their entire lair razed, everyone in their hidden caves slaughtered. Not a soul survived,” Du Teng said bitterly. “Yan Zhao got off too easy!”

Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong exchanged glances. The name Yan Zhao had surfaced again, like a persistent fly, buzzing everywhere they turned.

The story aligned: two years ago, Yan Zhao had likely been a spy for Yunqing Sect within Black Blood Ridge. Even then, he’d been poisoned by blood toxins, deceiving Yunqing Sect all along.

Wang Xiaorong nearly revealed Yan Zhao still lived, but Guan Yu stopped her. Better to let the reunited couple believe him dead, freeing them from vengeance and allowing peace.

“I’ve heard the same,” Guan Yu said. “A villain like Yan Zhao must have met his end. Such evil never prospers.”

Du Teng went to secure another room while they waited for Guan Yu’s antidote. At the fire hall, now empty, Guan Yu sat at his morning seat and pointed to two chopsticks embedded in a pillar. “Brother Du, look—someone managed this today, both skewered at once.”

“A master!” Du Teng marveled. “I couldn’t do this. Piercing one fly with a chopstick, perhaps—but two? Unmatched skill...”

Guan Yu remarked, “Even such a master claims he’d fail against Swordless Immortal. Yet you still meant to charge to your death. Thankfully, your child stopped you.” Du Teng smiled ruefully, glancing at Zhen Xiang.

As Guan Yu brought food and wine, Zhen Xiang’s resentment over Du Teng’s past abandonment faded. Though he bore blood toxins, she cared only that he lived.

“Ah Teng, you haven’t introduced your friends,” Zhen Xiang reminded.

“Ah, right! Forgive my thoughtlessness,” Du Teng said. “This is Lao Cang, a brother I met here, and his fiancée.”

Knowing the inn’s purpose, Zhen Xiang asked curiously, “Are you two here to challenge Swordless Immortal too?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Nothing so bold, sister-in-law. We’re merely passing through to Zhouji City, drawn by curiosity.”

“Men and their honor,” Zhen Xiang sighed. “I’ll never understand it.”

Wang Xiaorong added, “I know my limits, but *someone* here still fancies the idea.” She nodded at Guan Yu.

With the group’s efforts—and the child’s influence—Du Teng had been dissuaded. But if Guan Yu insisted on challenging the mountain, Wang Xiaorong dreaded how to stop him.

“Let’s drink, brother,” Du Teng urged. “But heed my advice—stay away from that mountain.”

Guan Yu drained his cup. “I only wish to see it, not fight. Yet the sect’s rules bar even that. I’ve half a mind to sneak in at night.”

“Drop the notion,” Du Teng said. “You couldn’t best me—what hope against Swordless Immortal?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Underestimate me, brother? Let’s spar and see!”

**Chapter 4132: Brothers’ Spar (Part 1)**

Wang Xiaorong knew Guan Yu’s pride—he’d never tolerate being belittled.

“Gladly!” Du Teng stood, moving to the courtyard. “Come, youngster. Losing’s no shame at your age.”

“Don’t hurt him!” Zhen Xiang called.

“I’ll be gentle.”

Guan Yu followed, grinning. “If *you* lose, don’t blame me for humbling an elder.”

“Bold words! Strike first.” Du Teng raised his guard.

Guan Yu didn’t hesitate. With a burst of speed, he closed the distance, fists flying. Their clash rang out—dozens of exchanges without clear advantage.

“Hold nothing back, brother!” Guan Yu taunted. “Your lady watches!”

“Enough boasts!” Du Teng roared, parrying a blow before leaping back. He drew his greatsword—thick-backed and heavy, a weapon Guan Yu had seen him practice with nightly.

As Zhen Xiang and Wang Xiaorong moved for better view, the former murmured, “I never realized Brother Cang was so skilled.”

“Even I don’t know his full strength,” Wang Xiaorong admitted. “He’s never lost.”

“Never?”

When Du Teng brandished his blade, Guan Yu summoned his Soulfallen Dagger—risking recognition but needing parity.

Noticing the weapon’s aura, Zhen Xiang whispered, “Sister Xiaorong... is that a *magic artifact*?”

“Yes. He’s a rare dual cultivator—martial and magical. Please keep this secret.”

Zhen Xiang gasped. Dual cultivation was legendarily perilous. “Heaven’s mercy... Ah Teng is outmatched.”

Unaware, Du Teng focused on Guan Yu’s dagger, dismissing its elegance. But as Guan Yu channeled energy, the blade flared. A spinning slash sent a searing arc toward Du Teng, who barely blocked it.

Wave after wave of energy strikes followed—horizontal, vertical, relentless. Du Teng staggered under the assault, robes fraying, hair loosened.

From afar, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi watched, joined by Lord Zou and his guards. “He’s like a ballista!” Wang Jun exclaimed. Yet Du Teng, though battered, held firm.

To cultivators, Guan Yu’s attacks revealed their true nature—spiritual energy shaped as martial force, blending disciplines seamlessly.

**Chapter 4133: Brothers’ Spar (Part 2)**

Du Teng gaped. How could one so young unleash such relentless strikes? Unbeknownst to him, Guan Yu’s dagger amplified his spiritual reserves, merging qi and magic.

Zhen Xiang recognized the imbalance—a cultivator overwhelming a pure martial artist. She nearly intervened but held back. Rules permitted no foul here.

Finally, Guan Yu paused. “Well, brother? How fare my strikes?”

Du Teng stood disheveled, hair wild, clothes torn. “Impressive... I misjudged you.”

“Your turn to attack,” Guan Yu offered.

“Stop this!” Zhen Xiang cried. “Ah Teng, you can’t win. He’s dual-trained!”

Ignoring her, Du Teng charged. Blades met—Guan Yu’s dagger flicked, a phantom slash grazing Du Teng’s shoulder.

Zhen Xiang shook her head. Against one who blended martial speed with magical strikes, resistance was futile.

As Guan Yu prepared another blow, the courtyard spectators held their breath—unaware this spar would redefine all their understandings of power.
