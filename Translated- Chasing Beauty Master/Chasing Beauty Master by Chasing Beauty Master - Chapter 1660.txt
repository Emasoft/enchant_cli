“Siqi, look, there are still two rooms left with four of us remaining.” Lin Chen stepped forward and said, “Since you refuse to share with Ling Su, and as Captain Guan Yu bears responsibility for everyone’s safety, that leaves only me, the deputy captain. Your only choice is to share a room with me.”

After speaking, Lin Chen’s heart swelled with glee. Such sudden good fortune—he’d never imagined this opportunity would fall into his lap. He then handed the room key to Siqi.

However, Siqi did not take it. She wasn’t one for eloquent arguments. At that moment, Guan Yu approached and asked, “So there are two rooms left?”

Lin Chen nodded curiously. “Don’t tell me you want to share a room with Siqi? You’re the captain. You have many responsibilities, including guarding everyone’s safety at night. That’s your duty.”

“Of course, I understand,” Guan Yu replied. “Which is why I think it’s most appropriate for you to room with Ling Su. As for Siqi, she can have her own room. Earlier, you mentioned I should prioritize protecting everyone, so I’ll sleep in the hallway. How does that sound?”

Everyone’s expressions turned to shock, including Siqi’s. She had assumed Guan Yu would step forward to offer sharing a room with her—and she would have happily agreed.

Instead, Guan Yu’s decision left Lin Chen and Ling Su speechless. They had no rebuttal.

“Sleep in the hallway? That’s not right,” Lin Chen said, narrowing his eyes. “There are still two rooms. No one would feel comfortable making you sleep outside.”

Internally, he cursed Guan Yu: *This bastard! If you want to sleep outside, fine—but why ruin my plans? How infuriating!*

Guan Yu explained, “With only two rooms left, you and Ling Su take one, and Siqi takes the other. As the sole woman here, propriety dictates she shouldn’t share with men. That leaves me without a room, so I’ll sleep outside.”

He added, “If any of you prefer, you can swap places with me. I’ll guard outside Siqi’s door. I doubt anyone objects to this arrangement.”

Faced with Guan Yu’s generosity, the others could hardly complain. They had rooms while their captain slept in the corridor. To protest further would be unreasonable.

Guan Yu took a key from Lin Chen and handed it to Siqi. “This room is yours. Rest early. I’ll guard your door later.”

Turning to the others, he said, “If anyone dislikes this arrangement, feel free to swap with me. Either of you can take my spot outside.”

Though worried Guan Yu might tire himself, Siqi trusted he had a plan. No one would foolishly stand guard all night.

Accepting the key cheerfully, Siqi said, “Very well. I’ll take a room alone. As the only woman, such treatment is fitting. The rest of you can sort yourselves out.”

**Chapter 4341: Regret**

With that, Siqi entered the inn. Lin Chen, seeing his scheme collapse, sighed. “Let’s all head in. Rest awhile, then gather downstairs for dinner.”

Guan Yu entered Wang Jun’s room, finding it spacious enough for two.

Wang Jun said, “Just stay here tonight. You brought this on yourself.”

“No need. I did this for Siqi’s sake,” Guan Yu replied. “I couldn’t let her lose face in front of everyone.”

“You’re not seriously sleeping outside, are you?” Aze chuckled. “This floor’s big enough. I can sleep here—Duoni won’t mind.”

Guan Yu patted his shoulder gratefully. “Thanks, but I’ll manage. If needed, I’ll join you later. Even a chair will suffice.”

Meanwhile, Ling Su searched room by room until he found Siqi’s—coincidentally adjacent to Wang Jun’s.

Knocking on her door, he called, “Siqi? Time for dinner. Everyone’s waiting downstairs.”

Hearing no reply, he smirked. *Is she asleep? What if I catch a glimpse of something…*

Rubbing his hands excitedly, he announced, “Siqi, I’m coming in!” He pushed the door open swiftly, hoping to catch her unprepared.

But the room was empty. “Siqi? You here?” he shouted, bewildered.

In Wang Jun’s room, Guan Yu shook his head. Siqi sat beside him.

“Lock your door tonight,” Guan Yu advised. “They’ll barge in recklessly. Stay cautious.”

“I’ll be fine,” Siqi said dismissively. “Let’s eat. Everyone’s tired.”

At dinner, Siqi trailed Guan Yu, determined to avoid Ling Su. The inn’s large round tables seated eight, and she secured a spot beside Guan Yu—only for Lin Chen to seize the seat on her left.

Ling Su descended late, dismayed to find no place near Siqi. He tapped a junior brother’s shoulder. “Move. I need to discuss matters with the captains.”

He settled opposite Siqi, who inwardly groaned. *Like a persistent rash…*

During the meal, Guan Yu stayed silent. Lin Chen finally ventured, “Siqi, is the food to your liking?”

“It’s fine. I’m not picky,” she replied politely.

“If you want anything special, just ask. I handle provisions,” Lin Chen boasted.

Noticing Ling Su mirroring her every bite, Siqi feigned concern. “Senior Brother Lin, why does Ling Su act this way? He even barged into my room earlier. Had I been there…”

Lin Chen bristled. “If he oversteps again, tell me immediately. I’ll discipline him!”

“By then, it might be too late,” Siqi said coolly. “As the only woman here, I feel unsafe. I’ll return to the Cloud Azure Sect tomorrow.”

“Don’t!” Lin Chen pleaded. “I’ll talk to Ling Su. He’ll stay away, I promise!”

Setting down her chopsticks, Siqi murmured, “If you help me, I’ll be grateful. You’re far kinder than Ling Su.”

As she left, Lin Chen’s heart soared. *She prefers me!* He devoured his meal, elated.

**Chapter 4342: Overreaction**

“Ling Su!” Lin Chen brandished his chopsticks. “Did you forget our talk already?”

The hall fell silent. Fellow disciples watched curiously—the two had been inseparable since Guan Yu’s arrival.

Guan Yu hid a smile. Siqi’s words were his coaching, meant to drive a wedge between the pair.

Lin Chen continued loudly, “How dare you invade Siqi’s privacy? She’s our sect’s pure and virtuous beauty—everyone’s goddess! Have you no shame?”

Gasps erupted. Ling Su shrugged. “She wasn’t even there. Why the fuss?”

“What if she’d been changing?” Lin Chen roared. “As her senior, you violate her room? Disgraceful!”

Wang Jun chimed in, “Senior Ling Su, you entered her room? How brazen!”

Guan Yu feigned concern. “What happened, Senior Ling Su?”

Under collective scrutiny, Ling Su faltered. “I just invited her to dinner! What’s wrong with that?”

“By barging in?” Lin Chen stood, livid. “Now she’s returning to the sect! When Elder Dai hears of this—”

Guan Yu rose. “Elder Dai dotes on Siqi. How will you face her?”

As Guan Yu left, Ling Su yelled, “I’ve done nothing wrong! Even Master would agree!”

“Keep telling yourself that,” Lin Chen sneered. “Once Siqi reports you, see how ‘right’ you feel!”

**Chapter 4343: No Mercy**

After dinner, Ling Su stewed. Siqi’s departure would doom him. *I rushed things. Should’ve waited for the desert…*

Approaching Lin Chen, he grumbled, “This is trivial! Why escalate it?”

“Trivial?” Lin Chen scoffed. “Elder Dai will skin you alive!”

Ling Su paled but blustered, “She’s overreacting!”

“Overreacting?” Guan Yu reappeared, cold-eyed. “Harm Siqi again, and I’ll make you regret existing.”

The threat hung heavy. Ling Su gulped, finally grasping the gravity.

Guan Yu turned to Lin Chen. “Keep him in line. Last warning.”

As disciples dispersed, whispers buzzed. Ling Su’s recklessness had cost him allies. Guan Yu’s ploy succeeded—the rift was now irreparable.
