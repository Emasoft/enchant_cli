**Chapter 1065: Rescue Mission**

Though the Song and Li families had joined forces against Guan Yu, Li Zeya himself would not intervene. This allowed Li Xuan to effortlessly divert their attention away from Guan Yu.

Guan Yu had mentioned it casually, never truly expecting Li Xuan to confront Li Zeya’s family. Their partnership had yet to solidify, and given Li Zeya’s formidable influence in China, Li Xuan would not recklessly challenge him.

With matters settled, Guan Yu could focus on rescuing Li Xi and the others. Yet frustration gnawed at him—no calls had come, and Cao Xiping had been taken away, leaving no leads. For now, he could only wait.

Li Feng and Li Qi had left to prepare for diverting the Li family’s attention, while Li Xuan remained with Guan Yu at the hotel, awaiting news.

During this time, Grandfather Wen and Grandfather Liu called, assuring Guan Yu of their full support regardless of his actions. Clearly, the two elders were prepared to mobilize every resource to aid him.

Guan Yu doubted their ability to help significantly. Retired for years, their influence had waned—a fact underscored by the current crisis. Still, their political and military connections, built over decades, might prove useful.

The incident had once again stirred chaos in Beijing. Upon learning Guan Yu was at the center, reactions ranged from shock to schadenfreude, though some worried for him.

As the saying goes, “When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter; when the wall crumbles, the crowd pushes.” Guan Yu had no shortage of enemies in Beijing. During his clash with the Song family, many smaller clans had seized the chance to strike. Now, families like Hu Zongze’s swiftly allied with the Song family, vowing revenge. Even the Zhu family, previously rejected by Guan Yu, joined their ranks.

Unfazed, Guan Yu coolly remarked to Dongfang Mu, “Let them dance for now. Once this is over, I’ll deal with them one by one.”

“What’s your plan, Xiaoyu?” Dongfang Mu asked.

“I’ve partnered with Dihao International in Hong Kong. They’ll draw the Li family’s fire. Once the Li family withdraws from Beijing, focus all efforts on crushing the Song family.”

Guan Yu disclosed Li Xuan’s involvement. Hearing “Dihao International,” Dongfang Mu nodded. “They’re reliable. Don’t underestimate them—had they expanded earlier into Southeast Asia, they might’ve surpassed Li Zeya’s family already.”

This bolstered Guan Yu’s confidence.

“Understood. Once I rescue Li Xi and the others, I’ll return to Beijing immediately.”

“Good,” Dongfang Mu replied before hanging up.

Beijing now simmered with tension, split into three factions: the proactive Song alliance targeting Guan Yu, the reactive Dongfang coalition defending him, and the neutral bloc. Though weaker, both major factions vied for the neutrals’ support, knowing their collective strength could tip the scales.

The neutrals, however, remained cautious. Many understood this was a decisive battle—victory meant dominance in Beijing, even all of China; defeat meant annihilation.

Few could have predicted that this upheaval would stem from a single university student: Guan Yu.

While Beijing simmered, Hong Kong roiled. Dihao International, based in Southeast Asia, launched a sudden attack on Zeya Industries, causing its stock to plummet by a percentage point—with further drops likely. Analysts speculated this was Dihao’s first move to reclaim Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, Li Zeya, stationed in the U.K., personally called to monitor the situation.

Guan Yu, however, was already en route to a remote island near Central. Li Xi, Lin Dong, and others had been taken there.

The island, a holiday spot deserted outside peak seasons, greeted Guan Yu with a villager who asked, “Are you Mr. Guan Yu?”

Nodding curtly, Guan Yu demanded, “Where are my friends?”

“This way, sir.” The villager led him through winding paths to a secluded cabin in a grove. “Inside,” he said before departing.

Guan Yu scanned the area, his detection system revealing over thirty trained guards. Yet inside, only Lin Dong and Cao Xiping were present—Li Xi, Jiang Yiyi, and Song Xiaoya were missing.

*They’re holding back a card*, he realized, stepping inside.

“Goddamn it, Guan Yu! What took you so long? I’ve been tortured half to death by these bastards!” Cao Xiping wailed, his pampered life ill-prepared for captivity and slaps.

Lin Dong, leaning against a wall, opened his eyes briefly, guilt flashing in his gaze. As a top-ranked assassin, recent failures weighed heavily on his pride.

“Shut up!” A thug kicked Cao Xiping, silencing him. The man then sneered at Guan Yu, “Thought you’d have three heads and six arms. Looks like you’re nothing special.”

“Spare the theatrics. Bring out your boss,” Guan Yu retorted, certain these lackeys weren’t the masterminds—Lin Dong would never have been captured otherwise.

“Clever,” the thug mocked. “But clever men die fast. Think you’ll walk out unscathed?”

On his signal, a dozen armed men emerged, guns trained on Guan Yu and the others.

**Chapter 1066: Locating Lin Dong**

“Guan Yu, go save Li Xi! I’ll handle this!” Lin Dong urged, though his drugged state left him powerless.

Guan Yu scoffed, “Save your breath. I know you’re weakened. Stay quiet while I deal with these fools.” To the thug, he taunted, “You think these toys can stop me?”

“Toys?” The thug laughed. “Let’s see you handle them!”

But moments later, his men lay unconscious.

“How?!” the thug stammered.

Cao Xiping cheered, “Hell yeah, Guan Yu! You’re a legend!”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu coldly ordered the thug, “Take me to your boss.”

When the man threatened Guan Yu would never find Li Xi without him, Guan Yu smirked. “A little insect might change your mind.” He flicked a Heart-Devouring Worm into the thug’s mouth.

Agonized screams followed as the worm gnawed his flesh. “Make it stop! I’ll talk!”

Guan Yu halted the torment. “Lead the way.”

**Chapter 1067: Departing Hong Kong**

In the Tomson Riviera penthouse, Li Zilong sipped wine, a seductive woman in his arms. Across from them sat the captive Li Xi, Jiang Yiyi, and Song Xiaoya.

“Darling, what will you do with them?” the woman cooed, feeding him wine.

“Kill the men, keep the women,” Li Zilong replied, lust undisguised.

The woman pouted. “Am I not enough? Send them to Madam Zhang’s brothel!”

Li Zilong slapped her thigh. “Don’t be cruel.”

Li Xi shook her head, voice icy. “Song Ziyu, why degrade yourself?”

Song Ziyu—member of the Song family’s collateral line and sister to Song Ziming, whose clash with Guan Yu sparked this feud—glared. Once Beijing’s celebrated socialite, she’d married into the Li family’s weak-willed branch, only to cheat with ambitious Li Zilong.

Humiliated by Li Xi’s past rejection from Song Qifeng—the man she desired—Song Ziyu struck Li Xi’s face. “You think you’re better?!”

Li Xi’s expression remained calm, though pain flickered.

Watching, Li Zilong licked his lips. *A true goddess.*
