Guan Yu continued, “You two good-for-nothings! When the Demon Soul Sect sent people to steal from your homes, they took the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Silkworm, injured your members, and destroyed your belongings. Now your enemies stand right before you, yet you remain unmoved. I truly doubt whether you two wastes possess even an ounce of loyalty to your sect!”

Yue Jing and Lai Lixia were at a loss for words. Having been berated and insulted by Guan Yu earlier, they now faced his renewed accusations—all of which were undeniable truths. The Crimson Lotus Sect disciples around them grew visibly uncertain.

Lai Lixia said, “Senior Brother, the conflict between the Cloud Azure Sect and the Demon Soul Sect has nothing to do with us. Let us leave. We have urgent matters to attend to.”

“Agreed. Let’s go inquire about what happened in the palace earlier,” Yue Jing hastily nodded, ignoring the disdainful glances from others as he turned to lead his group away.

Guan Yu sneered. *These two truly are spineless. Seeing the Demon Soul Sect’s experts here, they dare not even utter a word. The Crimson Lotus Sect lacks the strength to oppose the Demon Soul Sect. They bully weaker disciples but cower when faced with true power. No wonder they usually swallow their pride.*

With a few sharp remarks, Guan Yu had frightened off the Crimson Lotus Sect. Normally, the Left Envoy would not have allowed them to depart so easily, but with the Eight-Sided Drum Technique now in Guan Yu’s possession, he had no time to spare for trivialities.

Wang Xiaorong spoke up, “Left Envoy, you should return to the Demon Soul Sect. Once I return, I will personally explain everything to Father. I assure you, Guan Yu has no intention of handing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique to anyone from the Cloud Azure Sect.”

To prevent further conflict, she added, “Left Envoy, you may not know this, but Guan Yu seeks the Eight-Sided Drum Technique not due to his sect’s orders, but for personal reasons. A powerful seal in his mind restricts his abilities and fragments his memories. Collecting all four volumes of the technique is his only hope to break this seal.”

“Once Guan Yu gathers all four volumes, he will free himself from the seal. Please, do not make this harder. Take your men and leave,” Wang Xiaorong implored.

The Left Envoy nodded. While he distrusted others, Wang Xiaorong’s solemnity convinced him. Glancing at Guan Yu, he warned, “Guan Yu, the Young Mistress must not come to harm. Remember this.”

**Chapter 4988: The Debate**

After issuing orders to return to the Demon Soul Sect, the Left Envoy paused and turned back. “Guan Yu, you’ve already collected three volumes. Each volume reveals clues to the next. Did today’s discovery yield nothing?”

“It did!” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “Left Envoy, when we left the Golden Hall, words formed in white powder on the roof: *Boundless seas, valleys of the horizon, treasure of the dragon pearl, divine technique fulfilled.*”

Muttering, the Left Envoy frowned. “Treasure of the dragon pearl? Could the next volume be tied to the East Sea’s legends?” Still pondering, he departed with his men.

These clues would have remained secret had Wang Xiaorong not revealed them, as Guan Yu intended to share them with none. Yet under the circumstances—where the Left Envoy’s forces could not attack Guan Yu out of deference to Wang Xiaorong—disclosing the riddle offered some consolation.

The Left Envoy’s parting words struck Guan Yu. *Boundless seas… dragon pearl treasure… Could this refer to the East Sea Dragon Pearl and its fabled hoard? If so, I cannot leave the capital yet. My path remains tied to Jiang Yuankai.*

For now, only Guan Yu and the Demon Soul Sect knew of the clues. Unless the sect leaked them, others—including the Crimson Lotus Sect—would never guess the Golden Hall’s rooftop held the answer.

As for Yue Jing and Lai Lixia, those vile insects who constantly opposed him… *The more despicable the foe, the more they cross one’s path. Today I let them slip away, but next time, regardless of the situation, I will teach them a lesson they’ll never forget.*

Even crippling them would not sate his anger, yet as a Cloud Azure disciple, killing fellow orthodox cultivators risked severe repercussions. Sect Leader Sun Lotus would demand retribution, and not even Elder Xuan Ming could shield him.

Dawn broke over the capital, chaos rippling through its streets. Few understood the cause: intruders had stolen the colossal white gemstone from the Golden Hall overnight.

When guards stormed in, they found only the gem’s empty pedestal. The Emperor, enraged, canceled his birthday festivities. A breach of palace security overshadowed all else—who knew if assassins might strike next?

Nobles and officials gathered for the thwarted celebration. The Crown Prince stepped forward. “Father, we cannot let these thieves escape justice! Grant me the Imperial Guards to scour the city!”

“Fool!” The Second Prince scoffed. “These culprits vanished without trace. What hope have you, even with the Guards?”

“I’d deploy them to search every corner! Have you a better plan?”

The Crown Prince aimed to weaken Chancellor Li’s Imperial Guard forces through this endeavor.

“The stolen gem’s size and weight imply immensely skilled culprits,” countered the Second Prince. “Sending troops blindly would waste lives. The Guards are newly reorganized—their loyalty uncertain. Chancellor Li’s agents know the capital, but sacrificing them is unwise.”

“So we let these brazen criminals roam free?” The Crown Prince glared. “Are we to cower before them? Even if they sprouted three heads, we cannot tolerate such insolence!”

“Idiot.” The Second Prince turned to the throne. “Father, discreet investigation is wiser. The gem’s bulk limits how far it can be moved. Let us monitor covertly, then strike once we identify the culprits.”

**Chapter 4989: A Clever Plan**

Both princes vied for control of the investigation—a prime opportunity for glory. The Second Prince schemed: *Resolving this could restore my standing. Pin the blame on scapegoats, declare the case closed. The gem is lost, but my reputation would soar.*

“These mere ruffians warrant no fear,” interjected Prince Zou. “Lock down the city! Execute captives publicly as warning!”

Many ministers nodded approval. The Emperor decreed, “Prince Zou shall lead this task. Coordinate with Yu Kong for resources. Leave no accomplice unpunished.”

“Your Majesty’s will be done,” Prince Zou bowed.

The capital sealed its gates, mirroring the lockdown during Princess Jiangxin’s abduction. Soldiers combed every district, citizens tense under scrutiny.

Most terrified was Master Qin. The Cao family’s downfall had nearly ensnared him. Now, discovering palace intruders within his estate meant certain execution.

Gathering his household, Qin interrogated each servant for suspicious ties. In his study, his son Qin Huan reported, “Father, the Cao clan’s feud with Chu Fan of Rouge Theater is noteworthy. Chu Fan holds Princess Jiangxin’s favor.”

“Why mention an actor?” Master Qin frowned. “I tasked you with investigating the East Sea Treasure.”

“Consider this: Cao sought the treasure by abducting Jiangxin—a fatal mistake. We need not repeat it. Instead, seize Chu Fan. Jiangxin’s affection for him may compel her to beg Jiang Yuankai for the East Sea Dragon Pearl as ransom.”

Master Qin’s eyes lit up. “Brilliant! Chu Fan’s capture would pressure Jiangxin without directly threatening royalty. Spread word that he knows the treasure’s secret. Demand the dragon pearl for his life. Even if Jiang Yuankai refuses, we lose nothing by killing the actor.”

“Once the lockdown lifts, we’ll hire outsiders to abduct him. Safer that way,” Qin Huan added.

**Chapter 4990: Insight**

Prince Zou’s forces scoured the capital twice, arresting suspects but finding no gem. Cultivators from sects like Crimson Lotus, Demon Soul, and True Yang were expelled—yet Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong evaded detection.

That evening, Prince Zou summoned Guan Yu to the Crown Prince’s residence. Accompanied by Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong, Guan Yu found the estate surprisingly modest—nowhere near the Second Prince’s opulence.

In the council hall, Prince Zou asked, “Guan Yu, your thoughts on the palace intruders? Cultivators could easily infiltrate, yet we found no gem.”

Guan Yu chuckled nervously. “Why dwell on this? You expelled the sects. The theft caused no real harm—merely a missing stone. Let it rest.”
