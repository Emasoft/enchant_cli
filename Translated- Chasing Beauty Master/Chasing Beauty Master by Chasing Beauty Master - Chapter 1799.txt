“But even if you keep it on your person, it will bring you endless troubles and dangers. Is it worth it? Would you really risk your life for a divine artifact?” Guan Yu warned.

“For a cultivator, a divine artifact is indeed worth risking one's life for.” Wang Jun replied calmly, determined to retain the Dragon Eye Amber rather than surrender such a precious treasure.

Guan Yu cautioned, “Yet you forget this is an artifact you cannot control. Keeping it may give you psychological comfort, but serves no practical purpose. In your hands, this divine artifact becomes merely a dangerous toy that endangers your life.”

Hearing this, Wang Jun hesitated. He had indeed overlooked this crucial point earlier. The artifact spirit within the Dragon Eye Amber looked down on his weakness and would never accept him as master. The treasure would remain a useless trinket in his possession.

“Very well. Since keeping it proves futile, I'll follow your advice and exchange it with Xuanming for something useful.” Wang Jun conceded.

“Naturally. We must ensure this Dragon Eye Amber is sacrificed for worthy compensation.” Guan Yu said coolly. “Let's return and seek Xuanming directly.”

Wang Jun inquired, “Guan Yu, do you think Xuanming could bond with this artifact spirit?”

“Uncertain. Xuanming's true capabilities remain unknown to me. Perhaps he could - after all, as Cloud Azure Sect's leader, his power should be formidable.” Guan Yu reasoned.

After finalizing their plans, Wang Jun carried the Dragon Eye Amber back to Guan Yu's quarters. Night had fallen when they arrived, deciding to approach Xuanming at dawn. Wang Jun settled to rest in Guan Yu's room for the night.

Midnight found both men restless. Wang Jun struggled with parting from the treasure, while Guan Yu burned with curiosity about the artifact spirit, yearning to confront it yet apprehensive of its power.

The spatial realm was controlled by the artifact spirit. If trapped like Wang Jun had been, with no means of escape and Wang Jun's inability to rescue him, disaster would follow.

Chapter 4706: Unnecessary

Risking entry seemed unwise. Guan Yu recognized his limitations - he might not prevail against the artifact spirit in its own domain.

Pondering this, Guan Yu sat at the table while Wang Jun reclined on the bed, amber in hand. “Guan Yu,” Wang Jun mused, “if Xuanming bonds with this artifact, wouldn't that strengthen Cloud Azure Sect? Wouldn't that count as my contribution?”

“You still dwell on such thoughts?” Guan Yu retorted. “Cultivators covet artifacts obsessively. As a divine artifact, Xuanming will undoubtedly claim it - though whether he can bond with it remains uncertain. I suspect not.”

“As sect leader wielding the Hidden Dragon Sword - which only leaders can command - Xuanming likely already bonded with it. If so, he cannot bond with this amber.” Guan Yu explained.

“Then Xuanming has no need for it.”

“Not need, but desire.” Guan Yu countered. “You don't understand cultivators like Xuanming. They collect artifacts voraciously - I'd wager Xuanming hoards at least fifty, if not a hundred. Can he bond with all? Impossible. Yet he hoards them like a collector, studying them to derive new techniques. Even unbonded, this divine artifact's research value would make it irresistible.”

Wang Jun sighed, reluctant to surrender his hard-won treasure. Noticing this, Guan Yu advised, “No need for regret. We'll secure superior artifacts for you. This amber, while divine, brings more peril than benefit. Without bonding, it's useless. Even if bonded, your current strength couldn't protect it. Once word spreads, every rogue cultivator would hunt you. Better trade this hot iron for practical treasures.”

Though logical, Wang Jun remained troubled. “Guan Yu, why not attempt bonding? With this divine artifact as secondary to your Imperial Seal...”

Guan Yu shook his head. “I've no desire for death magnets. Even if attackers failed, the harassment would be endless. Moreover, from your description of the capricious spirit, entering risks entrapment beyond your power to rescue.”

Chapter 4707: Suicide Seeker

“If you won't, we'll trade it tomorrow. But surely someone as clever could escape?” Wang Jun tempted.

Guan Yu pondered. Though a divine artifact tempted him, complications abounded - abandoning current bonded artifacts (Imperial Seal with crucial Eight-Drum Techniques and Soulrend Blade's combat utility) proved unwise. Moreover, carrying such treasure invited danger beyond his current capacity.

Yet curiosity prevailed. “Hand me the amber. I'll attempt entry.” Guan Yu declared, settling with the artifact.

Wang Jun cautioned, “Consider carefully! If trapped...”

“If unresponsive by dawn, seek Xuanming. Explain and he'll extract me.” Guan Yu devised.

Nodding approval, Wang Jun watched as Guan Yu clasped the amber and closed his eyes.

Guiding a wisp of soul consciousness into the amber, Guan Yu's vision flashed. Suddenly he stood in mist-shrouded limbo, distant mountains and pagoda looming through haze.

“Visitors arrive! Where's the welcoming party?” Guan Yu shouted, knowing the spirit monitored all.

A gale whipped up as a voice mocked, “Another fool comes courting death!”

The artifact spirit manifested - floating grey-robed figure with phantom lower body, matching Wang Jun's description.

“Must you hover? Neck pains from staring.” Guan Yu complained.

“Interesting...” The spirit descended, peering curiously. “Here to bond?”

“Merely visiting. My friend said you seemed lonely.” Guan Yu shrugged.

The spirit chuckled coldly. “First visitor seeking conversation. What shall we discuss?”

“How long have you been trapped here?” Guan Yu probed.

“Trapped? I AM this realm!” The spirit snapped. “No time exists here. Stupid question!”

Undeterred, Guan Yu flattered, “One of your power must transcend such limits. Surely you could leave if desired?”

The spirit darkened. “You mock me? My master lives - our bond persists though his presence fades. He must be... detained.”

Chapter 4708: Uncommon Specimen

“Then your master survives but is incapacitated?” Guan Yu deduced.

The spirit's form flickered. “Clever worm. Unlike the last fool, you show promise. Why not attempt bonding?”

Guan Yu smiled wryly. “I prefer survival over glory. My current artifacts suffice.”

“Wise... for a mortal.” The spirit mused. “Yet your soul bears strange traces - dual cultivation paths? Unusual...”

The conversation danced on - Guan Yu probing carefully, the spirit vacillating between interest and ire. Each exchange revealed more about the artifact's history and the spirit's mercurial nature, while Guan Yu masked his true intentions beneath layers of feigned curiosity and strategic flattery.

Outside the amber's realm, Wang Jun kept vigil, unaware of the psychological duel unfolding within - a battle of wits where one misstep could trap Guan Yu eternally in the artifact's jade prison.
