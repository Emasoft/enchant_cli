“Ghost Actor, your real name is Xiang Jiamian, also known as Ghost Mask. I’ve heard of you too,” Guan Yu said with a disdainful gaze. “They say your disguise skills are ‘delightfully’ advanced, yet I saw through you immediately. Seems your acting isn’t as masterful as claimed.”

Xiang Jiamian knew Guan Yu’s prowess. Bill Lin had promised him substantial rewards—primarily monetary—if he could embed himself near Guan Yu and earn his trust. Though Xiang cared little for wealth himself, the Venomous Widow desperately needed funds to rebuild the Dark Sun Organization. After Guan Yu shattered their ranks during the Fang family incident, over half their members vanished. To restore their glory, the Venomous Widow required vast resources to attract new cultivators, as most experts only joined well-funded factions offering better prospects than solitary life.

This time, the Venomous Widow sent Xiang to squeeze more money from Bill Lin. Yet Guan Yu’s vigilance had exposed him early. “Your reputation precedes you, Guan Yu,” Xiang sneered, drawing a broad steel cleaver resembling a butcher’s blade. “But let’s see if your skills match your tongue!”

The weapon, comically oversized with a two-palm-wide blade and short handle, seemed absurd in his slender hands. Guan Yu watched mockingly as Xiang swung it with practiced ferocity. Despite Xiang’s ranking among Jianghu’s Ten Great Villains, his infamy stemmed not from cultivation strength but treacherous methods—ambushing foes through deception rather than open combat.

Though only a Second-Class Sovereign, Xiang’s unorthodox techniques allowed him to duel First-Class Sovereigns evenly. Yet against Xue Jing’s dagger and Hou Jinshun’s fists, he faltered. “You dare challenge Guan Yu?” Hou roared, lunging bare-handed. Xiang parried with a Wind-Splitting Slash, forcing Hou to dodge. Xue Jing blurred into the fray, her dagger clashing against his cleaver with sparks.

“Using numbers now?” Xiang taunted after their exchange rattled him. Meanwhile, Guan Yu reviewed phone footage of Xiang panic-messaging allies upon learning of the planned raid on Feng family’s factory—irrefutable proof of his betrayal.

“Traitor!” Hou bellowed, coordinating attacks with Xue Jing. As Hou swept at Xiang’s legs, Xue Jing thrust for his heart. Desperate, Xiang blocked her strike but left himself open to Hou’s crushing kick. Spitting blood, he collapsed as Xue Jing’s blade kissed his throat.

“Resistance was futile,” Guan Yu remarked coolly while Hou rained vengeful slaps across Xiang’s face. “Did Bill Lin send you? Or the Venomous Widow?”

Gagged by pride and pain, Xiang glared silently until Hou seized his hair. “Speak, worm! Or lose those eyes!”

Amidst the chaos, Guan Yu pieced together the plot: a failing Dark Sun’s last gambit, Bill Lin’s dwindling allies, and Xiang’s humiliating downfall before jeering onlookers. As phones recorded the scene, Guan Yu knew this spectacle would ripple through Jianghu—but darker tides awaited.

**Chapter 2953: Evidence**

“One fails, so you swarm like rats?” Xiang spat blood, though fear flickered beneath his bravado. Guan Yu’s evidence left no room for denial—the intercepted message timestamped perfectly with his panicked reaction.

“You’ll regret crossing us,” Hou growled, hefting Xiang’s own cleaver. Yet as the crowd murmured and security neared, Guan Yu intervened. “The Venomous Widow’s desperation reeks. Tell me Bill Lin’s plan, and your death may be swift.”

Xiang’s sealed lips earned him another brutal slap. “Still defiant?” Hou sneered. “Let’s see how long that lasts.”

**Chapter 2954: Negotiation (Part 1)**

Bound and battered, Xiang’s hatred burned. “Mark my words, Hou Jinshun—this shame will be repaid tenfold!”

“Repaid?” Hou laughed coldly. “You’ll be lucky to see dawn.” As he raised the cleaver, Guan Yu’s voice cut through: “Enough. Let his masters witness their pawn’s failure.” The real game, he knew, had just begun.
