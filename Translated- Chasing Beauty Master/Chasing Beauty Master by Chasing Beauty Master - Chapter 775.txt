“Boss Sun, we’ve lost them.” Li Yuan stared at the intersection ahead, where Guan Yu’s car had vanished.

“Damn it! He still managed to slip away!” Sun Xu slammed his fist against the car seat.

This golden opportunity had slipped through their fingers. There would be no next time—now Guan Yu’s retaliation loomed. Sun Xu had long prepared an escape route, knowing he’d have to live under constant threat. He’d already hired a team of bodyguards from a supernatural organization to guard him around the clock.

The gun he’d brought today had cost him a fortune through a friend’s connections. Worse, the damn thing came without bullets—it was empty, just a prop to intimidate Guan Yu. If he’d had ammo, he’d have shot the bastard on sight. The bullets were still en route, and he hadn’t planned to reveal the gun today, but desperate times called for desperate measures.

Blood seeped from the triangular wound on Guan Yu’s left arm, staining the car seat. The limb had gone numb, sharp pain radiating through it. By now, it was nearly 10 p.m. Seeing no pursuers in the rearview, Guan Yu slowed and dialed a number. “Hello? Ling’er, are you home?”

Qing Ling’er, a nurse, was his only hope for treating the wound.

*Sniffle.* “Guan… Guan-ge, I’m home…” Her voice trembled with tears.

“Why are you crying?”

“Oh, it’s nothing. Just watching a Korean drama.”

Guan Yu sighed. Girls obsessed over those shows as if the actors could leap off the screen. Did fictional heartthrobs really outshine real men? “Ling’er, pause the drama. I need your help.”

Hearing the strain in his voice, she sobered. “What’s wrong?”

“Do you have a first-aid kit?”

“Of course.”

“I’ll be there soon. Unlock your door.” Hanging up, Guan Yu circled the block to shake any tails before parking underground near Pan Taisheng’s residence.

When he staggered into Ling’er’s apartment, she gasped. His left side and right hand were drenched in blood.

“Guan-ge! Sit on the sofa—I’ll stop the bleeding!” She rushed to fetch her kit while he perched on the coffee table, avoiding staining her furniture.

The wound, two centimeters long and deep, had begun clotting but showed ominous purple discoloration. “It’s poisoned!” Ling’er exclaimed. “Who did this to you?”

Guan Yu had suspected as much from the numbness. Bai Jiao’s dagger must have been coated. He’d sealed key acupoints to contain the toxin. “Just ordinary poison. Clean it with alcohol—it’ll neutralize.”

“But alcohol will burn horribly!”

“Do it. Now.”

Trembling, Ling’er poured. Guan Yu roared in pain, body shuddering as she burst into tears. “I’m sorry! Are you okay?!”

Teeth gritted, he rasped, “Fine… It’s done.”

“You need stitches! Let’s go to a hospital!”

“No. They’re armed. Use your kit.”

“I’ve never sutured anyone! And there’s no anesthetic!”

“I’ll endure. Pretend it’s sewing cloth.”

After terrified hesitation, Ling’er complied. Guan Yu bore the agony silently, sweat dripping. Once bandaged, she cleaned his bloodied torso, cheeks flushing at his lean, muscular frame.

The atmosphere thickened as her fingers brushed lower. Startled by his body’s reaction, she stumbled back.

“It’s… just enthusiastic,” Guan Yu joked awkwardly.

“You’re impossible!” She tossed him the towel. “Finish yourself!”

“Help me to the end! At least my legs?”

“I’ll hang your clothes. Watch TV!” She fled to the balcony.

Later, Guan Yu yawned. “It’s late. Let’s sleep.” He flopped onto her fragrant bed. “Join me?”

“We can’t share a room!” She retreated to the guest bedroom.

By morning, his arm had healed remarkably—the poison proved weak. After breakfast, he drove her to work at the Hua Ye Club.

There, Hou Jinshun approached. “That woman you asked about—Jin Hua—we’ve got leads.”

In a private room, Hou unraveled the mystery: Jin Hua, born Jin Yuhua, was the sole survivor of a billionaire family massacred decades ago. Five conspirators—including ancestors of today’s Four Great Families—had bombed her father’s car, looted the Jin vaults, and built their empires with the spoils.

“The little girl thrown from the explosion… that’s Jin Hua?” Guan Yu murmured.

Hou nodded. “She’s waited years to avenge her family. And Yang’s maid, Zhang Han—she’s the key Jin Hua needs.”

The pieces fell into place. Guan Yu’s fight had just escalated from street brawls to a decades-old blood feud.
