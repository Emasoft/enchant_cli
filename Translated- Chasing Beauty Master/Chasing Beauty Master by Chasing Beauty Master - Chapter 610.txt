Chapter 1547: The Black Flood Dragon

Trapped by a horde of demons that had ambushed him beneath the forest, the Black Flood Dragon found no escape. Worse still stood a humanoid demon far stronger than him! A sharp-eyed demon suddenly recognized him and shrieked, “Lord! It’s them!” The humanoid demon cast him a haughty glance before looking away, as if prolonged eye contact would taint its dignity. “Where are the humans you promised?!” The surrounding demons trembled with fear at its rage, none daring to speak lest they invite calamity.

The Black Flood Dragon sneered at the humanoid demon and stated coolly, “I stand alone today.”

“Oh? How bold!” The demon taunted, its eyes brimming with disdain. “Lead me to that child, and I’ll spare your life!” The demons, initially relieved by Guan Yu’s absence, now quivered at the mention of seeking her out. Though Guan Yu seemed weak compared to this foe, her ruthless methods haunted their minds. None wished to antagonize her unless forced.

“Impossible!” the Black Flood Dragon retorted. While the demons knew Guan Yu’s whereabouts, his solitary arrival suggested he’d hidden her. None dared speak, fearing the fate of the lizard demon.

“Shadowy Tidal Surge!” Knowing he stood no chance, the Black Flood Dragon struck first.

“Foolish overreach!” The humanoid demon vanished, replaced by a colossal emerald tornado that devoured everything in its path. Trees and stones disintegrated into dust as the whirlwind surged toward the Black Flood Dragon like a murderous grinding wheel. When the attack formed, an overwhelming sense of invincibility gripped every demon’s heart.

The Black Flood Dragon revealed his colossal draconic form. “A mere insect?” scoffed the tornado-shaped demon. Though flood dragons were rare in the Abyssal Depths, strength alone commanded respect here—rarity offered no protection.

The tornado collided with the Shadowy Tidal Surge. Instead of an explosion, the latter spiraled into the whirlwind’s rotation like water in a centrifuge. Within moments, the Black Flood Dragon’s attack dissolved into nothingness.

All demons marveled inwardly: *Such power!* Though the Black Flood Dragon had anticipated his foe’s strength, the demon’s cunning—using the tornado’s rotation to dismantle his attack—left him awestruck.

*Damnation!* He refused to relent. “Blackwater Skyward!” The dragon soared upward, scattering demons beneath him as he vanished into the clouds.

The humanoid demon smirked, eyes alight with mockery, as if victory had been predetermined. It followed into the stormclouds, only to find the Black Flood Dragon shrouded in corrosive acid rain. If strength failed, terrain would suffice.

“Submit, insect!” The acid rain proved harmless to the demon. The Black Flood Dragon dodged frantically, but his speed paled in comparison. Soon, the demons below witnessed a massive form plummeting from the sky—none other than the battered dragon himself!

Mid-cultivation, Guan Yu jolted awake with sudden unease. She glanced at the meditating Murong Fengyu before bolting from the tree hollow.

Murong Fengyu stirred, assuming demons had returned, and followed. Guan Yu flew to the swamp’s edge, shouting, “Black Flood Dragon! Are you here?” Finding no demons, Murong Fengyu approached. “Guan Yu, he left earlier,” he admitted, realizing he’d never informed her.

“What? When?!” Panic surged as she grabbed his robes. “He left when you began cultivating. Something’s wrong!”

“During my cultivation? This is dire!” Guan Yu shot into the sky, Murong Fengyu close behind.

Dangling bloodied from a tree, the Black Flood Dragon dripped lifeblood onto grass now unnaturally verdant. The humanoid demon grinned hungrily. “Your heart must be delectable.” Its clawed hand plunged into his chest, spewing emerald blood. The dragon glared with defiance. *My lord…beware…*

Guan Yu faltered mid-flight, plummeting until Murong Fengyu caught her. Landing, they found battle scars and faint emerald bloodstains. Guan Yu scooped bloodied soil, her dread intensifying. Murong Fengyu scanned for scavenger demons lurking post-carnage.

A voice boomed overhead: “Human child! Come to Demon Abyss Valley at once, or this dragon becomes my meal!”

“Curse them!” Guan Yu raced toward the voice, Murong Fengyu wary of traps.

Demon Abyss Valley—home to two-thirds of the realm’s demons—stood eerily silent. Above the motionless horde, a figure lounged against a tree, another’s corpse hanging nearby.

Chapter 1548: Demon Abyss Valley

Guan Yu halted at the valley’s edge, entering stealthily. Murong Fengyu followed, impressed—her emotional depth hadn’t clouded her caution. The demons expected a flashy entrance, not this silent approach.

The valley mirrored Death Swamp’s bone heaps, but these were demon leftovers: fresh carcasses reeking, some still fleshed. Guan Yu’s grief ignited at the sight of the dragon’s body. Her hair and eyes crimsoned anew with violent rage.

Murong Feng羽 gripped her arm, sensing dozens of Saint-level demons nearby. But her fiery gaze warned: *Kill all in my path.*

“Foolish human! Remember the name Greedwolf—your end!” the humanoid demon sneered.

“You killed him?!” Guan Yu’s bloodlust swelled, hair blazing.

“Indeed!” Greedwolf spat, insulted by her disregard. “Seek vengeance, vermin?”

Murong Fengyu’s guilt churned—had he stopped the dragon’s departure…

“Infernal Conflagration!” Before Greedwolf moved, searing heat charred him. Demons stared in awe—strength alone earned respect here.

Guan Yu’s fury softened slightly toward Murong Fengyu. She knew her recklessness risked attracting stronger foes, but regret held no place.

At the dragon’s corpse, her small hand trembled. *If only I’d been stronger…*

“Guan Yu, flee!” Murong Fengyu yanked her back as a black energy sphere obliterated the body and nearby demons.

“No!” She watched the dragon’s remains atomize in his arms. Powerlessness crushed her—she’d failed to protect even a corpse.

A gray magic阵 engulfed Murong Fengyu, repelling Guan Yu. “Master!”

Realization struck him—today marked their one-month limit. He battered the阵 futilely. “No!”

“Master!!” Guan Yu scrambled to his vanished spot, finding nothing.

“You’ll PAY!” Her scream rent the air. Crimson hair and dress blazed as she blamed all demons.

“Such bravado!” A dozen cloaked figures emerged. “You’re unworthy.”

Madness consumed her. “Crescent Moon’s Withering!” The blood moon dyed her Soul-Devouring Whip crimson. Demons recoiled—until a scream tore their focus: one now bled emerald, his blood vanishing into the whip.

“A spirit artifact!” a demon gasped. (Weapon tiers: Earthbound, Spirit, Saint—Earth-grade. Celestial, Imperial, Divine—Heaven-grade. Demon God-tier—supreme.)

As demons closed in, Guan Yu braced for death—until a red light struck them down. A hovering egg etched with ancient runes floated above.

“What egg dares strike us?!”

“Eat it!”

The leader froze. “This…could it be…a weapon spirit?!”

“Impossible! No spirits exist here!”

The egg pulsed red, shaking Guan Yu’s whip free. It circled the egg protectively. Drawn by a call, Guan Yu stood—blood dripping—as the whip slashed her palm, draining her lifeblood.

The whip drank deeply, Guan Yu’s vision dimming. Yet it continued—until the egg’s crimson light erupted, piercing the heavens.
