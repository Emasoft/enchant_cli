Even the Second Prince was seeing this token for the first time. He took it and examined it first before asking, “Minister Qi, though we’ve been grasshoppers tied to the same string all these years, and you’ve done much for me, I’d only heard whispers of this hidden force of yours. Yet now it appears... this lies beyond my expectations.”

“Your Highness overthink,” Minister Qi replied. “This old servant has served you wholeheartedly for many years.”

“Of that I’ve no doubt. Yet this token...” The Second Prince’s voice tightened with unease. “If I guess rightly, none could command your death warriors without it.”

That a court minister harbored such covert power—unknown even to the Emperor—now revealed its terrifying implications to the Second Prince himself. “Minister Qi,” he said darkly, “your shadow network within the Imperial Guards... it gives one pause.”

Minister Qi’s heart chilled further. Not only had he lost numerous elite warriors, but now the Second Prince’s suspicion cut deeper than any blade. “Your Highness,” he protested, “though I maintain this small force, you’ve always known of it! Surely you don’t doubt my loyalty now?”

Yet doubt had indeed taken root. By rights, the token commanding these death warriors should belong to the Prince himself. But with current affairs unfolding, the Second Prince decided to shelve this matter. “Enough,” he waved. “Chancellor Li, take this token. Have your men rush to the prison and relay Minister Qi’s command.”

Chancellor Li accepted without comment, though inwardly noting the Prince’s changed demeanor toward Qi—a shift he deemed advantageous. “I’ll dispatch men immediately. Though simple in appearance, this task requires appeasing the prison guards first. It cannot be rushed.”

Meanwhile, the Eldest Prince arrived at the Imperial Guards’ headquarters, summoning captains and commanders. Their universal ignorance of recent prison events deepened his suspicions.

In the sprawling Imperial Guards complex, systematic inquiry proved impossible. Yet claiming ignorance of the prison incident—a major affair—stretched credibility. The Eldest Prince showed counterfeit commander tokens to various officers. Veterans recognized the fakes, while newer recruits proved unreliable witnesses.

The crucial clue emerged: recent recruits shouldn’t exist in the fully-staffed Guards. The Prince recalled Minister Qi secretly replenishing losses from intercepting Prince Zou’s faction—losses never reported to the Emperor.

Elsewhere, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi arrived at Fortune Inn on sect business. “Sent by Xuanming?” Guan Yu smiled. “The East Sea Dragon Pearl, I presume?”

The disciples exchanged glances. “You’ve heard then,” Wang Jun admitted. “The sect master hopes we’ll assist your treasure hunt. The whole Jianghu buzzes with this.”

“Easier said!” Guan Yu countered. “Am I to split myself between seeking the Eight-Sided Drum technique here and chasing rumors? I can’t be two places at once.”

“The sect master prioritizes the Drum technique,” Xiao Zhi explained. “The treasure rumors originated here—he merely asks you to gather intelligence while in the capital.”

Guan Yu eyed the newlywed. “Xuanming sends you so soon after your nuptials? Rather heartless, separating lovebirds.”

“My choice,” Xiao Zhi flushed. “Du Bingyan needed to visit her parents’ grave post-wedding. I accompanied her.”

As the Demon Soul Sect’s Young Mistress Wang Xiaorong offered wedding congratulations, tension thickened. Xiao Zhi’s sectarian prejudice clashed with forced civility, his recent poisoning by a demonic traitor fresh in memory.

When the elfin Qiqi declared herself Guan Yu’s “little wife,” shock rippled through the room. “She’s my... sister publicly,” Guan Yu amended weakly, prompting Qiqi’s theatrical clarification about secret identities.

Chapter 4976: Shifting Circumstances

Two days later, as the visitors departed, Chancellor Li returned Minister Qi’s token. “Your orders were delivered,” he reported to the Second Prince. “Yet the prison remains quiet.”

Minister Qi’s brow glistened. “True death warriors would’ve obeyed instantly! Their silence suggests...” He paled. “If they’ve turned, my head will roll.”

The Second Prince’s gaze sharpened. “Chancellor Li, could your men have erred?”

“The prisoners share Cao’s cellblock—confirmed through days of inquiry.”

“Then why no deaths?” The Prince turned to Qi. “What if your ‘loyal’ warriors betrayed you?”

Minister Qi shuddered. Exposure meant execution—not just for Cao’s assassination, but all clandestine operations. “Your Highness,” he croaked, “this could unravel everything.”

“Don’t panic yet.” The Prince’s voice hardened. “Chancellor Li, watch the prison closely. If opportunity arises... eliminate the prisoners directly.”

As the plotters schemed, none noticed shadows shifting beyond their chambers. In the silent prison, bound warriors exchanged knowing looks—their loyalty no longer certain. The game’s pieces trembled, awaiting the next move.
