“Correct. Lord Zhou is quite knowledgeable. The toxin on this iron needle is indeed lethal. However, when it encounters knockout drops, it instantly disperses through the body. Mere seconds are enough to claim a life,” Guan Yu declared.

Yue Gao added, “Guan Yu, are you suggesting the killer pruned Lord Wan with this small iron needle earlier without his notice? Since this poison wouldn’t kill immediately unless combined with knockout drops, the murderer later sent Lord Wan a cup of tea laced with a heavy dose of those drops. Only after drinking it did Lord Wan die?”

“That’s one interpretation, but it fails to explain one crucial detail,” Guan Yu countered. “Lord Wan’s time of death.”

He continued, “As I mentioned earlier, based on his body temperature and rigor mortis, Lord Wan died less than an hour ago—likely within half an hour. The discoloration spreading from his lips to toes further confirms this.”

“Within half an hour?” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “Does that mean Lord Wan was still alive when we arrived at the manor? Could he have not yet drunk the tea?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “This teacup serves as critical evidence. Everyone recognizes this porcelain cup—specially crafted with thick walls concealing a hollow interior. Such design preserves heat effectively, keeping tea warm for hours. Yet when we entered, the tea was completely cold, proving it had been sitting here for at least two hours.”

Lady Wan snapped impatiently, “Enough of this nonsense! If you accuse me of murder, produce evidence! Why would I invite a detective to my home if I were guilty? This is absurd!”

“Precisely because you wished to craft an airtight alibi under a detective’s nose,” Guan Yu retorted, locking eyes with her. “By staging the scene before investigators, you ensured suspicion would never fall on you. Admirable scheming, Lady Wan.”

“Outrageous lies!” She turned to Lord Zhou. “Will you permit this slander? I demand justice!”

“Justice you shall have,” Lord Zhou sighed. “But Guan Yu, unless you provide concrete evidence against Lady Wan, I must ask you to leave.”

Guan Yu smirked. “If you’ll indulge me further, the truth will reveal itself. The murderer is none other than Lady Wan. For proof, Lord Zhou—inspect her black gloves. They likely conceal more of those poisoned iron needles. Given the audience, she dare not dispose of them now.”

Lady Wan paled, her composure cracking. True to Guan Yu’s words, her gloves hid a spare needle—its deadly toxin meant for emergencies. She’d planned to discard it later, never anticipating this exposure.

As Lord Zhou approached, she clenched her fists, refusing to cooperate. Guan Yu pressed his advantage: “When we first met at the inn, Lady Wan wore no gloves. Yet upon entering the manor, she donned them—odd behavior for a noblewoman who affects fashion. The gloves appeared precisely when she needed to conceal evidence.”

Yue Gao nodded. “True—she handed me Miss Yuqing’s documents bare-handed at the inn.”

“Thus the gloves’ significance,” Guan Yu concluded. Observing Lady Wan’s panic, Lord Zhou conceded the likelihood of guilt but turned to Guan Yu. “Yet contradictions remain. The cold tea suggests hours passed, but the fresh corpse contradicts this. Explain.”

Guan Yu moved to a bookshelf, lifting a portrait frame. Alongside Lord Wan’s image stood another woman—not his current wife. “The timeline holds. Lady Wan, restless all night, grew impatient. After drugging Lord Wan’s tea, she staged a locked room using Yue Gao’s fishing line method—leaving telltale marks on the threshold. Discovering this oversight, she scattered extra lines to confuse investigators.”

He paced dramatically. “She then fetched us, committing the murder amidst detectives. When we broke down the door, Lord Wan appeared asleep. While we examined the room, she approached, implanted the needle behind his ear, and faked grief when his body slumped—accidentally dislodging the needle. Her miscalculation sealed her fate.”

Wang Xiaorong gasped. “You mean she killed him after we arrived?”

“Precisely,” Guan Yu affirmed. “The half-hour death window coincides with our presence. Only she could’ve acted then.”

“But we encountered the old master leaving!” Wang Xiaorong protested.

Lord Zhou frowned. “Motive, Guan Yu? Why murder her husband?”

“As second wife, she feared displacement. With Lord Wan’s son marrying and inheriting, her control over the estate would crumble. Eliminating Lord Wan and framing the senile patriarch secured her dominance. Investigating the fiancée’s background was mere pretext to block the marriage.”

As Guan Yu’s words sank in, Lady Wan collapsed, weeping. “I never wanted this! But if my stepson inherited, I’d be cast out! This was my only choice!”

“Take her away,” Lord Zhou ordered. Turning to Guan Yu, Yue Gao marveled, “Are you truly a detective? Such brilliance surpasses even mine!”

Wang Xiaorong beamed. “Our Guan Yu is extraordinary—a polymath who solves any puzzle!”

Lord Zhou requested their testimony, but Guan Yu demurred. “Yue Gao witnessed everything. His account suffices.”

As dawn broke, the pair returned to their inn. Finding their companion Salt Marsh absent, they eventually discovered him frail and pallid. “Ate too much rich food,” he groaned. “Spent all night in the privy.”

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “Serves you right for gluttony!”

“Waste not,” Salt Marsh weakly protested before Guan Yu cut in: “Rest today. We depart tomorrow.”
