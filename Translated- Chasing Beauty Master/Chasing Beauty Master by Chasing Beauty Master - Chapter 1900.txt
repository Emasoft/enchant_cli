“You’re still saying that? Nowhere is safe these days. A major incident occurred in the palace just days ago. You don’t even know—when danger comes, it can’t be stopped,” Jiang Yuankai said.

“If all else fails, let’s use a straightforward method,” the Princess continued. “We’ll spread a rumor that Chu Fan has already been killed. Once the news reaches Xin’er, she’ll grieve for some time, but at least she won’t keep making a fuss like now. After the sorrow passes, things will settle.”

Jiang Yuankai nodded heavily. Though not ideal, he deemed the plan feasible. After all, they truly couldn’t risk the precious East Sea Dragon Pearl to save Chu Fan. In both his and the Princess’s hearts, Chu Fan’s worth didn’t measure up to such a treasure.

**Chapter 4993: First Time Asking for Help**

Learning of Chu Fan’s “death” would devastate Jiang Xin. But by restricting her from leaving home recently, they hoped her grief would fade with time, allowing the matter to conclude peacefully—at least without surrendering the Dragon Pearl.

“Very well. For now, this seems the only path. But the news mustn’t come from us. Outsiders must deliver it to Xin’er. Otherwise, she won’t believe it. Our daughter appears naive, but she’s clever beneath the surface,” Jiang Yuankai remarked.

The Princess agreed. If Jiang Xin continued her uproar, she couldn’t endure it any longer.

Upon returning to her room, Jiang Xin couldn’t sit still, her heart aflame with worry. Chu Fan’s captors would surely torment him, and every delay in retrieving the Dragon Pearl heightened his peril.

Desperate, Jiang Xin realized her parents would never consent to trade the treasure. Frantically, she recalled someone who might help—Lord Wan Hong (Guan Yu). Biting her lip, she resolved to seek him, even if it meant venturing into the unknown.

“Xiao Yun, come in!” Jiang Xin called.

Her maid hurried inside. “Miss, are you hungry? You haven’t eaten since morning. Shall I fetch food?”

“Come look at this blanket—it’s soiled. Bring a new set and take this away,” Jiang Xin said oddly, scrutinizing her bedding in broad daylight.

Xiao Yun, her lifelong companion and confidante, approached without suspicion. As the maid turned her back, Jiang Xin seized a candlestick and struck her nape. With a soft thud, Xiao Yun collapsed onto the bed.

Trembling, Jiang Xin whispered, “Forgive me, Xiao Yun. I had no choice. I’ll apologize later—rest here awhile.”

Donning Xiao Yun’s clothes, Jiang Xin hid the maid under blankets, then slipped out of the estate with her head bowed. As the Princess’s favored maid, Xiao Yun enjoyed certain privileges. Guards at the gate merely asked her errand before letting “Xiao Yun” pass unchallenged.

Jiang Xin marveled at her smooth escape. She sprinted toward Fortune Inn, Guan Yu’s residence, several streets away.

At the inn, she inquired about Guan Yu’s room—the grandest on the second floor. Without hesitation, she knocked and pushed the door open. “Is Lord Wan Hong here?”

Inside, Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong, and Qiqi were mid-scuffle on the bed, the door unlocked. Frozen in awkward poses, they hastily disentangled. Guan Yu straightened his robes, flushing. “Miss Jiang? It’s late. Have you come to see me?”

The two women ducked under blankets, disheveled. “Please, come in,” Guan Yu said awkwardly. “Apologies for the…informality.”

“No matter. I’ve come secretly to beg your help,” Jiang Xin replied, entering.

Guan Yu nodded, already aware. “This concerns Chu Fan, doesn’t it? I’ve heard but found no leads yet. Rushing to surrender the Dragon Pearl risks both it and his life. Patience is key—without the pearl, they’ll keep him alive.”

“But I can’t wait! You’re his sworn brother—please save him!”

“I’m trying, but without clues, I’m powerless. Trust that his captors won’t harm him while they want the pearl.”

Jiang Xin pleaded, “You’re my only hope. This is the first time I’ve ever begged anyone.”

Guan Yu sighed. “I’ll investigate the capital’s major factions tomorrow, starting with the Three Great Families. The culprit likely knows your bond with Chu Fan and the pearl’s value. Second Prince is a suspect—your mother’s court stance may have provoked him.”

“Second Uncle? Impossible!”

“You’re young, Miss Jiang. The world’s darker than you know.”

“I’m not a child!” she retorted, indignant.

Guan Yu continued, “If not the Prince, other powerful players covet the pearl. The kidnapper understands the capital intimately—hence my focus here.”

Reassured by his involvement, Jiang Xin relaxed slightly. “Thank you, Lord Wan Hong. Forgive my intrusion.”

“Let me escort you back. The streets are unsafe at night.”

Jiang Xin glanced at the bed, a pang of inexplicable discomfort stirring. “Very well.”

After instructing the women to stay, Guan Yu draped his cloak over Jiang Xin’s shoulders. Though oversized, it shielded her from the autumn chill.

**Chapter 4994: Shelter from the Wind**

The gesture warmed Jiang Xin, yet his touch sent a nervous tremor through her. “I lack a carriage. We must walk,” Guan Yu said.

“I don’t mind,” she murmured.

As they strolled under the moon, Jiang Xin lingered, her pace slowing. “Lord Wan Hong…may I ask something?”

“Of course.”

She halted, moonlight illuminating her earnest gaze. “When I was kidnapped, everyone credited Prince Huang. But I know it was you who saved me.”
