“Everything I said is true. Because this gathering point is temporary, they usually relocate to cultivate new recruits after acquiring them. That’s why there are so few people here. Normally, those abducted from the east are sent west for training, and those from the west are sent east. This way, even if the abducted try to escape, they’re in unfamiliar territory and can’t easily flee.”

Chen Xiaona’s explanation sounded plausible, and Guan Yu nodded in acceptance. He then asked, “Your trafficking den must have many skilled members, but they can’t be on guard twenty-four hours a day, right? If I wanted to rescue the abducted, when would be the best time to strike?”

The question was grave. Chen Xiaona had already divulged more than she should, believing that if her ropes were loosened, Guan Yu would slaughter everyone here. Returning to her organization, she could explain herself without being branded a traitor. But this new inquiry was perilous—leaking such information would bring immense trouble to the syndicate.

When Chen Xiaona remained silent, Guan Yu paused his efforts to untie her and asked, “What’s wrong? Don’t you want these ropes removed?”

Chen Xiaona suddenly felt a wave of dizziness, her mind growing foggy. Only then did she realize she’d been deceived.

A seasoned veteran, Chen Xiaona understood the physical states of cultivators intimately. Even if prolonged restraint caused her limbs to numb from poor circulation, the brain, rich with blood, shouldn’t succumb to paralysis. Yet now, her head felt leaden, her thoughts scrambled—clear signs of drugging.

She suddenly recalled the water Jin Hua had brought her earlier. It must have been tainted. Guan Yu had feigned ignorance all along! No wonder he’d acted so kindly—the water was poisoned.

“Guan Yu, you despicable scum! Resorting to such underhanded tricks!” Chen Xiaona spat through gritted teeth.

Unfazed, Guan Yu straightened, smiling as the drug took hold. “Different foes demand different tactics. Soon, you’ll obediently answer every question. Saves us both the trouble.”

Chen Xiaona strained against her bonds, hoping Guan Yu’s earlier fumbling had loosened them. But his next words enraged her: “Save your strength. I never intended to untie you. I was just checking the knots—and tightening them.”

Defeated, Chen Xiaona’s consciousness blurred. The knockout drug in the water served its purpose—a hypnotic agent to lower defenses, allowing interrogation without the risks of invasive mental probes that could damage the mind.

By the time Chen Xiaona’s eyes rolled back, drool spilling from her lips, the drug had peaked. Guan Yu began his questioning, extracting crucial intel even A’cai hadn’t known. With this information, dismantling the trafficking ring seemed feasible.

Guan Yu recorded the confession, planning to hand it to the police at the right moment. Though tempted to execute Chen Xiaona, he opted to spare her life, deciding collective justice through law enforcement was preferable.

**Chapter 2,289: The Black Captain**

After securing the confession, Guan Yu had Jin Hua administer the antidote. A’cai dragged Chen Xiaona to the courtyard as Laili contacted the police.

Western police efficiency impressed—within five minutes of the call, sirens wailed as two patrol cars screeched to Laili’s gate. Seven heavily armed officers emerged, their gear enviable.

A towering black officer, nearly two meters tall with burly shoulders, led the approach. “Who called it in?”

His team eyed the Easterners warily—recent terrorist attacks by Asian suspects had left tensions high. A mall bombing killing forty still haunted the city, the perpetrators suicide-poisoning before interrogation.

“I reported it,” Laili said, pointing at Chen Xiaona. “She’s part of a trafficking ring. My friends caught her trying to abduct me.”

Chen Xiaona glared venomously at the black captain. She remembered his face—the officer who’d gunned down her lover during a botched operation. Her hatred burned.

As Laili fluently recounted events (scripted by Guan Yu), the captain noticed Chen Xiaona’s venomous stare. “You seem to despise me. Have we met?”

“Bastard! I’ll kill you!” Chen Xiaona writhed futilely toward him.

“No need for such animosity,” the captain replied, feigning innocence.

Guan Yu stepped forward with a disarming smile. “Officer, she hates you because you killed her husband—an Easterner during a trafficking bust.”

“Ah! So they’re connected,” the captain mused. Behind him, a tall female officer with striking blue eyes studied Guan Yu curiously, her gaze appreciative amidst her colleagues’ suspicion.

**Chapter 2,290: Reunion**

“Indeed,” the captain nodded. “You seem well-informed. Would you assist with our report?”

Guan Yu inwardly groaned—visiting the station was inconvenient. The captain, deceptively amiable, proved shrewd.

Compromising, the captain offered: “If the station’s too much, we’ll take your statement here.”

Relieved, Guan Yu agreed. The captain then radioed: “Ms. Lei, we need on-site documentation.”

A woman emerged from a patrol car—petite at 1.6 meters, clad in athletic wear with police gear at her waist. Her jet-black hair danced in the breeze as she approached.

Recognition struck Guan Yu like lightning—Feng Xihu, his complicated past flame, now radiantly transformed.

“Guan Yu, long time no see,” she smiled.

Stammering, Guan Yu managed only, “Hello.”

“You know each other?” the captain asked.

“An old friend from China,” Feng Xihu replied.

As officers hauled Chen Xiaona away, Feng Xihu stayed behind for questioning. Inside, she teased: “Neglecting your harem to gallivant with new lovers?”

Guan Yu deflected, asking about her police career.

“After leaving A City, I drifted until realizing police uphold justice everywhere,” she shrugged. “Though here, becoming an officer’s no easy feat—unlike China, where money talks.”

Their banter continued, Feng Xihu subtly probing about Jin Hua while Guan Yu redirected. The reunion, charged with unresolved history, unfolded under the watch of justice—and a female officer’s admiring gaze.
