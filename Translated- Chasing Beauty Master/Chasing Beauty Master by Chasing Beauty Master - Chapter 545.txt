“After all, elves are nimble. Amy swooped over to Bika Cat’s side in an instant, scooping it up as she exclaimed, ‘Bika Cat, where were you last night? I thought you’d gotten lost!’

‘Bika Cat? That’s its name?’ Liu Chuntian asked curiously.

‘Mm-hmm! Sister Chuntian, this isn’t an ordinary cat—it has many extraordinary abilities!’

Guan Yu rolled his eyes helplessly. This little girl really had to boast about it to everyone! It seemed Bika Cat was about to become famous again in Barren Town.

‘Amy, stop talking and come eat properly!’ Guan Yu called out, trying to rein her in.

But Amy completely ignored him, tossing back, ‘I’m not hungry! The food’s awful—you eat first!’

She then continued explaining Bika Cat’s uniqueness to Chuntian. ‘Sister Chuntian, can you tell this isn’t just a cat but a formidable magical beast?’

Liu Chuntian’s cultivation was lower than Amy’s, her knowledge limited to basic swordsmanship as a novice swordswoman. Shaking her head, she admitted, ‘I can’t sense anything, but now that you mention it, there is something unusual about it…’

‘Oh, let me tell you—this is a Magister-level magical beast! If converted to human swordsmanship rankings, it’d be equivalent to a Sword King!’

Though Liu Chuntian had braced herself for something impressive, the words ‘Sword King’ still shocked her. Her grandfather, whom she considered a master, was only an Advanced Sword Master—several tiers below a Sword King! That meant even her revered grandfather couldn’t defeat this adorable creature…

‘W-wow… really? How can it be so powerful?’

Amy preened at Chuntian’s astonishment, her childish vanity gratified. ‘But that’s not even its most remarkable trait!’

At this, Liu Yishou—eating at another table—held his breath. *These youngsters keep shattering my worldview. Meeting them makes me feel like I’ve wasted half my life!*

When Amy’s words reached him, his pride suffered another blow.

Leaning conspiratorially toward Chuntian, Amy whispered, ‘I’ll tell you a secret—Bika Cat can speak…’

‘What?! It talks?!’

The bombshell made Chuntian shriek, flinging the cat from her arms in terror.

Liu Yishou gaped in disbelief. Though not highly cultivated, he’d encountered hundreds of magical beasts—none that spoke!

Poor Bika Cat had been blissfully nestled in the beauty’s arms when it suddenly hit the floor headfirst. Scrambling up, it glared at Chuntian. ‘Young lady, if you disrespect me again, I’ll lose my temper!’

The still-terrified Chuntian froze upon hearing its voice. Simultaneously, Liu Yishou leapt between them, shielding his granddaughter as he quavered, ‘D-don’t hurt her!’

Guan Yu quickly intervened. ‘Ahem, apologies. It’s temperamental but means no harm. It only got upset after being thrown down for no reason.’

‘I’m sorry… I was just scared…’

Chuntian’s pitiful expression instantly melted Bika Cat’s anger. It transformed back into a docile kitten, rubbing against her ankles.

The tension dissolved as Chuntian giggled at the tickling fur. Amy happily scooped up the cat, feigning sternness. ‘Hmph! Bad kitty! If you snap at people again, I’ll have Dragon Brother punish you! Understood?’

‘Meow!’ Bika Cat nodded sweetly.

After breakfast, they prepared for their mission. Having promised Guan Yu, Liu Yishou resolved to search the mass graves for the monster.

When Amy and Chuntian insisted on joining, Guan Yu vetoed firmly. ‘This isn’t a picnic—you’ll only be liabilities. What if something happens?’

‘But—’ both girls protested.

‘Enough. We’ll return quickly if there’s danger. Besides, it’s daytime—monsters won’t show easily.’

‘Fine… but be careful!’

‘Grandpa, stay safe! Lord Guan Yu, protect him!’

Daylight emboldened them to bring Bika Cat—whatever awaited might require its prowess.

**Chapter 1380: Demon Hunt**

Nodding, Guan Yu set off with Liu Yishou and Bika Cat toward the burial grounds.

The streets showed slightly more activity than yesterday, though townsfolk still hurried about stockpiling supplies against the monster.

‘Are these people fools?’ Guan Yu muttered. ‘If the monster comes, how will hoarding help? Hiding solves nothing.’

Liu Yishou frowned. ‘Don’t mock them, young lord. Not everyone shares your prodigious talents. Commoners can only hide and pray.’

‘Ah, I meant no offense,’ Guan Yu backpedaled. ‘But perpetual avoidance only emboldens the creature. Why not unite to drive it out for good?’

Sighing, Liu Yishou admitted, ‘Easier said than done. Our townsfolk lack such resolve—they’ll only act when personally threatened.’

Guan Yu nodded—this mirrored human nature from his previous world. He’d hoped for better here, but found the same selfishness.

‘Very well. Let’s proceed quietly. We’ll request help only if necessary.’

‘Agreed. Drawing attention before locating the monster would be unwise.’

They reached the town’s edge where a low hill loomed—desolate and eerie from neglect.

A farmer spotted them approaching the forbidden area and shouted, ‘Are you mad? Stay away!’

Guan Yu approached. ‘Why? What do you know about the burial grounds?’

‘Outsider, that place is cursed! Enter and you’ll never return!’ The man noticed Liu Yishou. ‘Old Liu! You know better than to lead him there!’

Before Liu could explain, Guan Yu interjected, ‘We’re investigating the monster rumors—they say it came from there.’

‘Monster?!’ The farmer paled. ‘That’s no monster—it’s…’ He trailed off, shaking his head. ‘Forget it. Just don’t meddle!’

As the man turned to leave, Guan Yu flashed 100 gold coins. ‘Tell us what you know, and this is yours.’

Greed overcame caution. ‘Fine! That “monster” is vengeful spirits—accumulated resentment from thousands buried there! They’ve come collecting debts!’

Guan Yu nearly groaned—ghost stories in a magic-and-swords world? Still, he thanked the man politely.

After pocketing the gold, the farmer warned, ‘Kind stranger, leave this to locals. Why risk your neck?’

Watching him leave, Guan Yu felt pity. These people’s apathy gnawed at him—why should an outsider care more than them?

Liu Yishou sighed. ‘You were right, young lord. Their cowardice and greed make them deserve their fate.’

‘Don’t say that. I’m just frustrated. But having taken this on, I’ll see it through—my honor demands it.’

Secretly, Guan Yu suspected the “monster” linked to Locke—if so, curing Amy’s poison would clear his conscience for future adventures.

**Chapter 1381: The Mysterious Apprentice**

After another hour’s trek, the burial hill loomed—a nightmarish landscape even for Guan Yu’s battle-hardened eyes. Countless mounds and scattered bones littered the slope. Strangest of all, sunny skies had given way to ominous clouds, casting everything in eerie gloom.

‘This place reeks of death. Was it always like this?’

Liu Yishou nodded. ‘Decades past, elves and humans fought brutally here. Thousands perished, many unclaimed. The resentment lingers.’

‘Who first connected the monster to this place?’

‘Rumors spread after recent attacks. Most blame accumulated grudges, but I saw the creature myself—it’s no ghost.’

Guan Yu trusted Liu’s account over hearsay. ‘Bika, scout ahead. Stay alert and call if threatened.’

As the cat vanished, Liu Yishou awkwardly offered, ‘Perhaps I should wait here…’

‘Too late—we’re already in its territory. Stay close.’

Half an hour passed with no sign of Bika Cat. Guan Yu’s confidence wavered despite knowing its abilities.

The gloom deepened unnaturally—high noon now felt like dusk. Liu Yishou trembled. ‘Could… could the monster have eaten your cat?’

‘Nonsense! A Magister-level beast outmatches—’ Guan Yu cut off as rustling sounded ahead.

They tensed, expecting Bika—but a gray-robed youth emerged instead.

The stranger froze upon seeing them. ‘Wh-what do you want?!’
