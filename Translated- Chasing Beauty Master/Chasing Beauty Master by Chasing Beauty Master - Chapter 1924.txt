Jiang Yuankai spoke up at this moment, “If you wish for any chance of resolving this situation, hand over the antidote now and cure my men of their poison.”

The leader kicked the man beside him and cursed, “Hurry the hell up! Bring out the antidote for these lords! Stop kowtowing like idiots!” His anxious movements betrayed both fear and desperation, grasping at this sliver of hope with frantic urgency.

Guan Yu truly had no intention of sparing these men. Protecting Wang Xiaorong’s identity was paramount—these loose tongues could never be allowed to spread rumors.

After Xiao Wu and others took the antidote, their strength quickly returned. Jiang Yuankai also ingested a pill, though Qiqi was left to sleep peacefully—perhaps she’d recover naturally by dawn without needing the antidote.

Regaining his vigor, Jiang Yuankai stood and shook out his limbs, feeling his internal energy stabilize. “Brother Wan, retract your aura. I believe there’s another way to handle today’s matter.”

“Very well. I’ll defer to your judgment,” Guan Yu nodded. His initial intent to kill had been for Jiang Yuankai’s sake, but since the man himself proposed mercy, Guan Yu relented. Still, he kept vigilant watch—none would escape under his gaze unless they outran lightning itself.

Jiang Yuankai stepped forward. “Without my stating the obvious, you know what’s required to leave here alive. Yet I cannot simply release you. I demand assurances—my reputation cannot afford carelessness.”

“Prince Consort, we understand completely,” the leader rasped. “We swear to return to the grasslands and abandon the martial world forever. Today’s events will never leave our lips.”

“Once, I might have trusted your word. But your actions today shattered that faith.” Jiang Yuankai’s voice turned glacial. This was his final concession—for family and honor, he’d prepared alternatives. Lives might be spared, but freedom and reputations would be forfeited.

“Survival isn’t impossible,” Jiang continued, “but where’s your sincerity? How can I trust oaths from those who’d vanish beyond my reach? Loose tongues would make me a laughingstock.”

**Chapter 5056: A Better Reason**

The dilemma hung thick. Xiao Wu, resentment burning, spoke from behind: “My lord, these vermin don’t deserve mercy! They nearly killed us!”

Another subordinate agreed: “Their treachery proves them faithless. Were our positions reversed, they’d show no quarter even after seizing what they wanted.”

Guan Yu silently concurred. Mercy toward cutthroats was folly—a betrayal of self-preservation.

Jiang Yuankai turned, eyes hardening. “One path remains: each of you severs an arm and renounces the martial world. That... or death.”

Gasps arose from Wang Xiaorong and Duan Ruxue at the brutality. Yet between limb and life, the choice seemed clear—until one considered these grassland warriors. An arm lost meant disgrace and helplessness among their people.

“Screw your arms! We’ll die fighting!” Roaring, the leader swung his broadsword at Jiang Yuankai—emboldened as Guan Yu’s suppressing aura had lifted. Jiang dodged frantically, still weakened from the poison. Xiao Wu and others rushed to aid him.

Guan Yu moved like shadow, his Falling Soul Blade severing limbs with surgical precision. Chaos erupted until all eleven grassland brothers lay defeated, three missing arms, blood pooling on the ground.

“Brother Jiang,” Guan Yu suggested, “let’s finish them. Leaving such scum alive serves no purpose.”

“They’re not irredeemable,” Jiang countered. “But their tongues and freedom shall be forfeit.” He ordered Xiao Wu: “Remove their tongues and imprison them in the capital’s dungeon under our guard. Let their cells become their graves.”

Guan Yu approved—better than slaughter. The group’s nerves were frayed, especially Duan Ruxue, who now regarded Guan Yu and Jiang with fearful awe.

As arrangements were made to send prisoners back, their numbers dwindled. “We’ll rest here tonight,” Guan Yu decided. “I’ll scout secure lodging.”

The inn’s cramped rear rooms forced uncomfortable arrangements. Duan Ruxue refused to room with Wang Xiaorong until Guan Yu positioned guards nearby. “My room borders yours left and right. You’ll be safe.”

“You’re insufferable!” Duan Ruxue stamped her foot, pride warring with fear. She secretly wished for Guan Yu’s company but lacked pretext.

**Chapter 5057: A Slap**

Dawn found Duan Ruxue sleepless, haunted by severed limbs and leering eyes. Desperate, she crept to Guan Yu’s door—which swung open to reveal Jiang Yuankai’s quarters. Mistaking the figure in bed, she reached out—

“Who’s there?!” Jiang bolted upright, fist connecting with her eye. She crashed to the floor as guards burst in, witnessing the compromising scene.

“You brute!” Duan Ruxue slapped Jiang before fleeing, her shriek rousing the entire inn.

**Chapter 5058: The Fingerprint**

In her room, Duan Ruxue sobbed, left eye swollen shut. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi stared bewildered as Guan Yu arrived.

“What happened?” he demanded.

Before explanations came, the crimson handprint on Jiang Yuankai’s cheek told its own tale—a night’s peace shattered by misadventure and martial honor’s sharp edge.
