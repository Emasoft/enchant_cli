Li Yunshan was truly exhilarated! He never expected Guan Yu to present him with such an enormous gift—it far surpassed his wildest expectations! What an incredible surprise!

Originally, they had agreed to split both the purchasing funds and final profits equally. Yet the profits from this red jadeite before them would undoubtedly surpass his earnings from three to five years of business!

His effusive embrace of Guan Yu stemmed from overwhelming gratitude. Yes, pure gratitude!

He knew Guan Yu wanted to repay him. But such a magnificent gift was beyond astonishing! Staring at the red jadeite, Li Yunshan solidified his resolve: he must maintain good relations with Guan Yu and follow his lead. Absolutely.

With an exasperated smile, Guan Yu patted Li Yunshan's back and muttered, "Old brother, what are you doing... Sister-in-law won't be pleased if she finds out!"

"Huh?" Li Yunshan and the surrounding crowd froze momentarily before realization dawned. Li Yunshan's earlier declaration of "sharing everything" had inadvertently included... wives! With a bitter laugh, he punched Guan Yu's shoulder. "Brother, that's one thing we can't share!"

"Exactly! If you wanted to share that, I'd refuse too! You're getting off too easy!" Guan Yu chuckled teasingly.

The lighthearted joke warmed the atmosphere. Li Yunshan excitedly rubbed his hands, leaning closer to examine the colossal treasure. "So rare! Within half a day, every major newspaper and news outlet nationwide will be clamoring to report this!"

Moreover, the red jadeite's sensational impact might attract major international jewelry corporations for acquisition... They'd truly struck gold this time!

As the crowd buzzed around the gem, Guan Yu noticed Du Xueheng sitting despondently in a corner. Under normal circumstances, Guan Yu wouldn't spare pity for someone who'd treated him coldly in Myanmar. But considering Du Xiaojuan's connection, he couldn't let Du Xueheng face bankruptcy. After all, his primary purpose in participating in this stone gambling was to improve relations with Du Xiaojuan's family.

Calmly approaching, Guan Yu pulled up a chair beside Du Xueheng.

The dejected man looked up at Guan Yu's impassive face and forced a smile. "Congratulations, Brother Guan. You and Boss Li are the true victors here."

Indeed, while others celebrated Li and Guan's windfall, who noticed those left behind?

Guan Yu tilted his head slightly. "Just luck."

"Luck?" Du Xueheng shook his head bitterly. How could repeated "luck" explain consecutive jackpots? True skill lay beneath.

Rubbing his face, Du Xueheng sighed. "Back in Myanmar, you warned me. Yet I foolishly ignored your advice. My own carelessness caused this."

"Don't dwell on it. We'll find better stones next time. Join me on another venture—how about it?" Guan Yu encouraged cheerfully.

"What? Truly?" Du Xueheng gaped in disbelief. After proving his expertise twice over, countless tycoons would beg for Guan Yu's partnership. Yet here he was, offering help voluntarily!

This unexpected kindness during adversity overwhelmed Du Xueheng. His so-called friends now avoided him, yet this young man reached out. Remembering his past hostility in Myanmar, shame burned his cheeks.

"Life has ups and downs. Don't let this setback define you." Guan Yu poured tea, handing a cup to Du Xueheng, who scrambled to receive it respectfully.

Watching Du's obsequious manner, Guan Yu suppressed amusement. If only he knew Guan Yu was the very suitor he'd driven away from his daughter! The irony of becoming sworn brothers with his potential father-in-law!

Noticing Guan Yu's interaction, Li Yunshan frowned. What connection warranted such attention? Clearly, deeper ties existed than met the eye.

As arrangements were made to transport the priceless jadeite, Li Yunshan approached. "Let's celebrate—just our inner circle." His dismissive glance at Du Xueheng stung the落魄man's pride.

"Let Du join us," Guan Yu interjected. Before refusals could form, Li Yunshan magnanimously declared: "A few million loss means nothing! For Brother Guan's sake, I'll cover it!"

The dramatic shift highlighted Guan Yu's influence. Du Xueheng stammered gratitude, astonished by the mogul's sudden benevolence.

Later in the car, Li Yunshan inquired directly: "What's your history with Du?"

"He's my classmate's father."

"Female classmate?" Li raised an eyebrow.

Guan Yu's awkward cough confirmed it. "I only recently discovered. Though he disapproved of me before..."

Li Yunshan scoffed. "Short-sighted fools! But worry not—with your talents, women will flock naturally."

At the五星hotel banquet, liquor flowed freely. Three rounds later, flushed faces and slurred speech prevailed.

Du Xueheng raised a trembling glass. "I don't thank you for promising help... but for treating me with respect when others scorned! I'll always consider you my brother!"

Guan Yu froze. Sworn brothers? With his girlfriend's father?

"I swear—no ulterior motives!" Du Xueheng vowed. "If I lie, may lightning strike—"

"Enough!" Guan Yu intercepted the oath. Through his special perception, he confirmed Du's sincerity. But this comedic twist—future father-in-law as sworn brother? Absurdity!

Leaning close, Du Xueheng slurred conspiratorially: "I know why you're kind... Those prostitutes I sent? Forget it! Real men indulge! But you? Resisting those hotties? Admirable!"

Guan Yu gaped. The misunderstanding deepened.

"Listen," Du continued. "My daughter's a beauty... I'll introduce you! Between brothers, no problem!"

Guan Yu choked. Du Xiaojuan's own father offering her up? The irony!

Later, returning to his room, Guan Yu received Du Xiaojuan's call. "I miss you," she sighed.

"Soon," he promised. "Your family matters... let's say I've made unique progress."

Indeed—what progress! From enemy to sworn brother, with her father eagerly matchmaking. If only she knew!

Hanging up, Guan Yu shook his head. When truth emerged, what spectacular chaos would ensue?
