At this moment, Guan Yu devised a plan. Since there was still some time left, he might as well go intimidate Li Gui. He found a large black cloak and dressed himself identically to Second Only to Wolf. Standing together, the two were nearly indistinguishable except for a slight difference in height.

Guan Yu was slightly taller than Second Only to Wolf. After instructing him on what to do, Second Only to Wolf nodded in understanding.

Soon after, Second Only to Wolf stealthily approached Li Gui from behind and inserted a silver needle into his shoulder. Li Gui cried out in pain, bewildered as his entire body became paralyzed.

A cold voice whispered in his ear, “What is your relationship with the person on the stage? Speak the truth, or I guarantee your immediate death.”

Trembling with fear, Li Gui realized his immobility was this man’s doing. To save his life, he spilled everything. “Spare me, great hero! Spare me!” he pleaded.

Second Only to Wolf hissed coldly, “Keep your voice down. Slowly explain your connection to the man on stage, and I’ll spare you.”

“Y-yes! That man was hired by my father. He’s one of the Ten Great Villains of the martial world—Ghost Lightning. Beyond this employment, we have no other ties! I beg for mercy!” Li Gui stammered, shivering.

“You’re obedient. I like that. But you must pay for your actions.” With that, Second Only to Wolf departed, leaving the needle embedded in Li Gui’s neck.

“Great hero, please release me! I admit my wrongdoing and swear never to repeat it!” Li Gui wailed, unaware his tormentor had already left. Paralyzed by the needle sealing his meridians, he stood rigid as if acupuncture-point locked.

Meanwhile, Second Only to Wolf washed his hands casually below the stage before leaping onto the platform. The crowd erupted in cheers, eager to witness a thrilling duel.

An elderly man approached Second Only to Wolf. “Please present your identification.”

Handing over Guan Yu’s ID, Second Only to Wolf received a nod. “Mr. Guan Yu meets our arena requirements. Proceed to select your weapon.”

The cloaked figure nodded and moved toward the weapon rack. Guan Yu watched from a shadowed corner, unnoticed by all except Li Gui, who puzzled over the concealed identity. The elderly Lin family member’s lax verification also raised suspicions—normally, identities were thoroughly checked. Li Gui himself had struggled to forge Yu Shida’s credentials.

But immobilized, Li Gui could only fret about his predicament. Removal of the shoulder needle would free him, yet none came to aid.

At the weapon rack, Second Only to Wolf surprised Guan Yu by selecting a massive battle-axe instead of his signature long saber. The weapon’s two-meter wooden haft and thirty-centimeter blade resembled an elongated version of Li Kui’s legendary axe from “Water Margin”—cumbersome and unpopular due to its weight and unwieldiness.

Guan Yu frowned. While confident in his ally’s skills, this choice seemed recklessly theatrical for a match determining Lin Qiaoqiao’s marital fate. Yet he held his tongue, trusting Second Only to Wolf’s judgment.

The warrior tore cloth from his pants to wrap the axe’s handle, creating insulation against electricity—a clever countermeasure against Yu Shida’s lightning-based cultivation. Dragging the weapon center stage, he began peculiar practice swings.

Chapter 3039: Mounting Anxiety

Guan Yu realized the strategy: wooden haft and cloth wraps provided insulation against Yu Shida’s lightning attacks. Traditional metal weapons would conduct electricity dangerously.

The duel commenced with Yu Shida hesitating, sensing his opponent’s formidable aura. “Is that really Guan Yu?” Lin Qiaoqiao whispered to her father Lin Zhonggeng, who clenched his fists in silent prayer.

Second Only to Wolf continued eccentric axe maneuvers until Yu Shida unleashed a thunderous bolt from his rapier. The crowd gasped as lightning tore across the stage—only for it to explode harmlessly against a crimson energy shield surrounding the axe-wielder.

Yu Shida gaped as subsequent lightning barrages similarly shattered against the protective dome. The cloaked warrior remained unfazed, his shield flickering red with each impact.

Chapter 3040: Satisfactory Results

This defense was Second Only to Wolf’s latest innovation—inspired by Guan Yu’s legendary barriers but requiring constant energy infusion. While lacking his friend’s effortless deployment, it proved effective against electrical onslaughts.

Frustrated, Yu Shida lunged close-range, rapier crackling with condensed lightning. At the crucial moment, Second Only to Wolf swung upward—axe met blade in a blinding flash that whited out the arena. When vision returned, Yu Shida hurtled backward, defeated by his own reflected force.

The crowd erupted as Second Only to Wolf stood triumphant, axe still whirling through practice arcs. Guan Yu smirked—his ally’s unorthodox methods had prevailed again.
