“Because my daddy is the most amazing person in the whole wide world, that's why I'm not worried at all! Heehee!”

"Ahem..." Amy's words struck right at Alan's heart. His previously deflated spirits instantly reinvigorated. Like a child receiving praise, his face bloomed with paternal pride as he declared, "Naturally! Good you recognize that!"

Observing this comedic father-daughter duo, Guan Yu suddenly felt a pang of longing. His thoughts drifted to his own parents, then to his wives in another world.

"Xiao Ling, Shilei, all my beloved wives... your husband misses you! When I've carved out new territory here, I'll bring you all to experience this wondrous foreign realm together!"

"Dragon Brother, what are you thinking about?"

Amy's tiny hands gripped Guan Yu's arm as she blinked her large innocent eyes. The child's adorable appearance snapped Guan Yu back to reality. With a soft smile, he teased, "I was wondering why our elven princess is so utterly charming."

"Stop that! Amy's grown up now! Don't call me cute anymore!" The girl's protest sent both Guan Yu and Alan into laughter.

Suddenly remembering his purpose, Guan Yu straightened. "Chief, I have a request. Might I ask a favor?"

"Speak. If within my power, I shall oblige."

Encouraged by Alan's forthrightness, Guan Yu stated, "When I first entered the Elven Forest, I sampled your race's treasure - the Source of Life. Yet what you consider sweet nectar tasted vile to me. Rossi explained it's due to first-time consumption."

"Precisely! The Source of Life is as vital to elves as its name implies. Its efficacy and flavor are unparalleled - our entire race depends on it." Alan's face glowed with racial pride when mentioning the sacred substance.

"I've heard the Source resides on an isolated island. Might I be permitted to visit?"

Guan Yu held little hope for approval, yet dared ask regardless. The Source's rumored ability to enhance elemental absorption and comprehension could prove crucial for adapting to this world. If he could transcend human limitations in elemental attunement, perhaps even develop magical abilities...

A mage wielding gravity manipulation? With such power, dominance across realms seemed possible - and with it, any beauty he desired!

Alan frowned at the request. No outsider had ever visited the sacred site. Approval would breach centuries of tradition and invite opposition from Elder Kyle's faction. Yet his daughter's pleading eyes and Guan Yu's earnest gaze swayed him. "Very well. But discretion is vital. Take this talisman and observe secretly. The Source may yet benefit your constitution. Return transformed."

Guan Yu felt deeply moved by this unexpected trust. "I'll honor your words." He noted the implicit permission for extended stay, provided he remained undetected.

"Father! I want to accompany Dragon Brother!"

"Absolutely not!" Alan's refusal brooked no argument. "This must be done covertly. Your presence would draw attention."

Pouting momentarily, Amy relented. "Fine. I'll stand guard outside! Let me catch anyone badmouthing you!"

"You imp..." Guan Yu chuckled, pinching her cheek.

"Don't call me 'imp'!" Amy slapped his hand away. "Call me that again and I'll ignore you forever!"

...

Moonlight silvered the mist-shrouded lake as night fell. Guan Yu gazed at the sacred isle, talisman in hand. "Finally. May this aid my cultivation. Three days maximum, Alan said - prolonged exposure risks backlash." The so-called backlash meant not just lost progress, but stolen abilities - akin to cultivation deviation.

The talisman circumvented the protective array jointly maintained by Alan and three elders. Forceful entry would trigger alarms. "So many precautions... Well then, Source of Life - here I come!" With a leap, Guan Yu vanished into darkness.

Chapter 1246: Blessing or Curse?

Dawn found Guan Yu blinking awake on a massive tree limb. Remembering his nighttime arrival via talisman, he wondered - had the artifact's side effects or sheer exhaustion caused his immediate slumber?

After stretching, Guan Yu surveyed the island. Hundreds of massive trees stood with listless foliage despite their girth. Recalling Alan's concerns about dwindling Source production threatening elven survival, Guan Yu approached a relatively healthy specimen.

High in its branches glinted fist-sized green fruits. Leaping up, Guan Yu plucked one. "The Source must be inside." The spiky fruit resembled durian. Crushing it released colorless liquid. Though wary from his first bitter experience, Guan Yu sniffed - fragrant, as Rossi described.

He drank deeply. Sweetness flooded his senses. "Incredible! Same substance, completely different experience after a day!" After devouring eight fruits, restraint halted him despite craving more.

"Master, your body's saturated. Now attempt elemental perception." The voice in his mind signaled Vajra's awakening.

"I'll try. During this-"

"I'll maintain vigilance. Obviously." Their long partnership made the unspoken rebuff clear - of course the guardian spirit would protect his cultivation.

Guan Yu smiled. Though the island seemed secure, evening would bring elven harvesters. Settling in meditation pose, he initially felt nothing unusual. Then warmth blossomed in his dantian, spreading through his meridians.

Suddenly, all elements - metal, wood, water, fire, earth, light, darkness - came rushing like frenzied moths to flame. Though eyes remained closed, Guan Yu sensed the maelstrom. Had he looked, the spectacle would terrify.

"Master?!" Vajra's alarm coincided with Guan Yu's realization - elemental overload was inflating his body like balloon. Levitating helplessly, his form swelled dangerously.

"Can't absorb all! Select elements!" Vajra urged. But consciousness fading, Guan Yu barely registered. With a flash, Vajra materialized and struck his head. Darkness claimed him.

...

Guan Yu awoke to sunset hues. Rising gingerly, he rubbed his throbbing skull. "Vajra! Next time, aim elsewhere. What if you damaged my brains?"

"Apologies, Master. Emergencies permit no delicacy. Any changes?"

Guan Yu flexed limbs. "Just soreness. Wait-" Black markings spiderwebbed his hands. "Poison? Qi deviation?"

"Unlikely. Try moving."

As Guan Yu gestured, Vajra exclaimed, "Look! Your hands!"

Black patterns shifted with each motion. "Feels heavier... but wait - elements stir when I move!"

Vajra laughed triumphantly. "Master! You've awakened as a mage!"

"Mage? Preposterous! I'm Nascent Soul-"

"That was another world! Here, embrace new possibilities!"

The logic disarmed Guan Yu. "How?"

"Test it. Destroy that flower through magic."

Guan Yu promptly kicked it. "Like this?"

Facepalming, Vajra groaned. "MAGICALLY! Forget martial arts! You're a mage now!"

After multiple failed attempts, Guan Yu sat cross-legged, chanting "I am a mage" like mantra. Three minutes later, eyes snapped open. "Burn!"

Flames erupted from his fingertips, reducing the blossom to ashes.

"I... did it..." Guan Yu stared in awe. Within days, an otherworldly human grasped magic basics - sufficient for any novice's pride.
