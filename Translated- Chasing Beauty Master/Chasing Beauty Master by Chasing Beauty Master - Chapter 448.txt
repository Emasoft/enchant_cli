If he could take them along, Guan Yu would certainly have done so.

That night, they attended to him with even greater abandon.

The next morning, fearing tearful farewells, Guan Yu kissed each of them on the cheek before employing the Earth Shrinking Art to return to the Zhou residence.

“Grandfather Zhou, I wish to take Xiaoyou (Morning Excellence) with me for three months of cultivation. Do you consent?”

**Chapter 1119: Dao Nine Farewell**

( ) Elderly folk typically rise early, and though Guan Yu had arrived at an uncommonly early hour, Zhou Xiaochuan (Little River) was already breakfasting. KeLe extends wishes for success to all college entrance exam takers.***

Zhou Xiaochuan naturally had no objections, but before he could nod, Zhou Tianci (Heaven’s Gift) immediately refused. “You brat! Always coveting our Xiaoyou! Let me make this clear—she will *not* be going with you!”

“Impudent fool! Withdraw!” Zhou Xiaochuan’s eyes narrowed sharply at his son.

*Worthless wretch! Can’t he see that Xiaoyou would only benefit from accompanying Guan Yu?*

Had he not heard the adage circulating these days: “If one must have a grandson, let him be like Guan Yu”?

A man so universally praised could hardly be lacking. Moreover, every interaction had left Zhou Xiaochuan thoroughly impressed.

He’d once worried Guan Yu might disdain Xiaoyou. Now that the young man had come seeking her, how could he refuse?

“Father!” Zhou Tianci protested resentfully.

“Xiaoyou’s life was saved by Guan Yu—need I remind you? Summon her and let her speak her mind.” Zhou Xiaochuan ordered his son to fetch his granddaughter.

Zhou Xiaoyou (Morning Excellence) had willingly become Guan Yu’s Dao companion, her heart already inclined toward him.

When Xiaoyou appeared, her flushed cheeks betrayed her fondness for Guan Yu.

Zhou Xiaochuan’s heart bloomed with delight. He’d long hoped to unite them after her recovery.

“Let’s go. I’m ready,” Xiaoyou murmured shyly.

Zhou Tianci could do nothing. With both his father and daughter in agreement, his objections were futile.

“Where are we headed now?” Xiaoyou asked as they walked.

“First to the Dragon Group headquarters. We’re meeting them there as agreed yesterday,” Guan Yu replied, casually draping an arm around her shoulders.

Their newfound spiritual intimacy made the gesture feel natural.

At Dragon Group headquarters, Guan Yu strode unannounced into the leader’s office. The staff paid no heed—this had become routine.

After all, even Bao (Leopard) had been bested by Guan Yu. What chance did they have of stopping him? Not that they had any grounds to try.

“Ho! You’ve brought her already?” Long Aotian (Proud Heaven Dragon) greeted with an amused grin.

Something about the man’s smile struck Guan Yu as unnerving. *Best not provoke this one lightly,* he thought, remembering the unassuming yet potent rod Long Aotian had given him previously. A man who’d risen to lead the Dragon Group was no simple foe.

“Naturally. I feared you’d miss me too keenly during my absence,” Guan Yu replied in a deliberately cloying tone that made Long Aotian shudder.

“Enough! Spare me the theatrics,” Long Aotian cut him off.

“But surely you knew this was my nature?” Guan Yu pressed, relishing the leader’s discomfort.

The man’s usual stern demeanor made this playful side unexpectedly entertaining.

“Where are Master Yehe (Wild Crane) and Wan Qingyang? They should’ve arrived by now,” Guan Yu asked after waiting awhile.

“Likely waiting outside, assuming you hadn’t come,” Long Aotian chuckled, clearly enjoying the tease.

“Why didn’t you tell me?!” Guan Yu shot him a glare, mentally chiding the man while maintaining outward composure.

Their recent interactions had fostered a familiar camaraderie.

“To serious matters. Your destination—” Long Aotian began, interrupted by the arrival of Wild Crane Daoist and Wan Qingyang. Anticipating Guan Yu’s presence, they joined Bao as Long Aotian addressed the group: “Exercise caution. You may not be alone there.”

Areas rich in spiritual energy rarely remained secret.

“Leave it to me. Focus on your affairs—I’ve made arrangements,” Wild Crane Daoist stroked his white beard assuredly.

Long Aotian trusted the elder implicitly after years of acquaintance.

Before their departure, he tossed Guan Yu another object—ugly yet undoubtedly useful, like previous gifts.

“What’s this?” Guan Yu inspected the walnut-like husk.

“Discover that yourself,” Long Aotian dismissed them with a wave.

Stowing the mystery item, Guan Yu followed the others out.

“Master, where exactly are we going?” he asked Wild Crane Daoist, envisioning secluded, energy-rich locales.

“All will be clear when we arrive by car,” the Daoist replied, habitually smoothing his beard.

Their confusion at eschewing flight arts was met with: “Our destination isn’t hidden. You’ll find it resembles prior sites.”

**Chapter 1120: The Cultivation Grounds Are... A School?**

“This is...?” The group stared in astonishment—Guan Yu most of all. ***KeLe extends wishes for success to all college entrance exam takers.***

He’d imagined ancient forests, not...

“Linchuan University,” Xiaoyou murmured. “I’ve been here before.”

“Cultivation isn’t about scenery,” Wild Crane Daoist said, amused by their shock. “This place brims with spiritual energy. We’ll attend classes by day, cultivate at night—an ideal arrangement.”

“But shouldn’t sacred sites look... sacred?” Guan Yu protested.

“Energy isn’t judged by appearance,” Wan Qingyang countered. “My Qingyang Sect thrived in desert wastes until their energy waned.”

“True,” Guan Yu chuckled. “When I first saw your young sect leader there, I mistook him for a child charlatan.”

Wild Crane Daoist gestured at Guan Yu, Xiaoyou, and Bao. “This remote university holds unique power. Merely residing here enhances abilities. From today, you three are students.”

“And us?” Wan Qingyang indicated himself.

“You’ll be my assistant,” the Daoist decided.

“As what? I should know my role here.”

“University board member. At my age, what else?” The Daoist laughed.

Guan Yu nodded—it made sense.

“You, nodding!” Wild Crane Daoist swatted his head. “Think me ancient?”

Guan Yu smirked. *I implied nothing!*

**Chapter 1121: The Terrifying Gaze**

During class, a passerby’s piercing stare locked with Guan Yu’s—unmistakably hostile, undoubtedly targeting him. By the time Xiaoyou asked what was wrong, the figure had vanished.

“Guan Yu! Explain the rediscount rate,” the professor demanded, catching his distraction.

Prompted by Xiaoyou’s whisper, Guan Yu answered flawlessly, though his mind lingered on those chilling eyes—a harbinger of coming trials.
