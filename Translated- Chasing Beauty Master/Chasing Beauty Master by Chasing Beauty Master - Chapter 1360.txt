“It seems all those were lies,” Guan Yu remarked. “They’ve long been interested in Elder Meng Hua’s relics. Xi Liu is determined to obtain the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Only then can the Monster Demon Cave grow stronger, allowing them to rise above their current plight and no longer live in constant fear under the Demon Lord’s watch.

“Securing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique is their only path to prominence. That’s why Xi Liu must come tonight, even if it means severing ties with the Demon Soul Sect.”

“This isn’t surprising. If even I know about this, others must too,” Guan Yu said. “It seems we’ve gained another enemy within Duobao Mountain.”

Wang Xiaorong seethed with frustration. Xi Liu had clearly deceived her earlier, claiming she wished to avoid worldly conflicts and live quietly, content with managing the Echo Pavilion. Now, it was evident those words were hollow.

“Hmph! Once I return, I’ll inform Father about the Monster Demon Cave’s schemes and have him deal with them,” Wang Xiaorong declared, pouting.

Guan Yu sighed. “Could you perhaps climb down now?”

Wang Xiaorong giggled sheepishly. “Oh, I’d grown so comfortable sitting here—it felt so steady, I forgot I was perched on your shoulders! No wonder it was warm.” With an apologetic smile, she hopped down.

Si Qi harbored deep resentment toward Wang Xiaorong. Were it not for their reliance on her to enter Duobao Mountain, she would have driven the girl away long ago.

“Guan Yu, should we head in now?” Xiao Zhi approached and asked.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Not only should we wait, but we’ll let the Monster Demon Cave enter first. Once they clash with the Demon Soul Sect, their conflict becomes none of our concern.”

“The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. A fine plan,” Xiao Zhi said eagerly.

Initially, they feared the Monster Demon Cave’s arrival would compound their troubles, given both factions belonged to the Demon Sect. Yet Guan Yu reconsidered: provoking conflict between them might not only avert additional challenges but also conserve their strength.

“Guan Yu, all your scheming targets the Demon Sect. Do you even regard me as one of them?” Wang Xiaorong grumbled, discomforted by the anti-Demon Sect talk amidst these righteous cultivators.

Were it not for her deep affection for Guan Yu, she would never endure this humiliation. She’d have long retreated and ordered her subordinates to eliminate these minor threats from Cloud Azure Sect. But to remain by Guan Yu’s side, she tolerated their words, feigning deafness.

**Chapter 3518: Lack of Strength**

“Aren’t you with us?” Guan Yu replied warmly. “With you here, we can enter Duobao Mountain. Without you, there’d be no purpose in my going.”

His comforting tone mollified Wang Xiaorong, whose temperament softened easily with kind words—especially from Guan Yu.

“I’ve betrayed even the Demon Soul Sect for you. You must take responsibility,” she cooed.

The saccharine words sent shivers down Guan Yu’s spine. Xiao Zhi and A Ze watched enviously as beauties flocked to him. Xiao Zhi wistfully imagined Si Qi treating him with such affection—though it remained mere fantasy.

A Ze, observing from the window, reported, “Two more arrived. The Monster Demon Cave has mobilized many tonight.”

“Let them come. They’ll clash with the Demon Soul Sect, sparing us the trouble,” Guan Yu said dismissively.

Wang Xiaorong understood Guan Yu’s strategy: let rivals weaken each other, allowing Cloud Azure Sect’s quartet to claim the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Yet she warned, “Don’t celebrate prematurely. If the Monster Demon Cave overwhelms the Demon Soul Sect, you’ll face greater peril.”

“Impossible. If they annihilate the Demon Soul Sect’s thirty-strong force, their own ranks will dwindle. We benefit either way.”

“You underestimate them,” Wang Xiaorong countered gravely. “The Demon Soul Sect’s Left Envoy leads their group. With me present, he dares not act against you. But if the Monster Demon Cave eliminates them, they’ll show no mercy—regardless of my status.”

Guan Yu conceded her point. Xiao Zhi added pragmatically, “She’s right. The Monster Demon Cave can swiftly reinforce from Qujiang City, while the Demon Soul Sect’s reinforcements are distant. We must guard against the Monster Demon Cave.”

“Unnecessary,” Guan Yu dismissed, sitting. “The Monster Demon Cave lacks the strength to defeat the Demon Soul Sect.”

“Whether they do or not, caution is wise,” Wang Xiaorong said. “If they attack, it’ll be you protecting me, not the reverse.”

A Ze returned from the window. “At least two dozen. They scaled the western wall. Some remain visible on rooftops, but vanish upon descending. Should I investigate?”

“They’ve brought significant numbers. We need a strategy,” Guan Yu said. “Stay hidden. Let them engage the Demon Soul Sect first.”

“Agreed. We’ll wait until they’ve advanced, then follow discreetly.”

“How cunning!” Wang Xiaorong chided. “I can’t wait! What if they plunder Duobao Mountain’s treasures?”

“Feel free to enter alone,” Guan Yu teased.

“Ugh, you’re insufferable!” she huffed, reluctantly staying put.

A Ze hurried back to the window, signaling silence. “Someone approaches!”

Qin Manor’s staff should be attending Master Qin Tiaijin, while the Demon Soul Sect had likely entered Duobao Mountain. Who could this be? Guan Yu joined A Ze at the window.

A woman in black robes, masked, approached hesitantly—likely from the Monster Demon Cave, yet lost or separated. She counted rooms along the guest quarters before stopping at theirs.

A Ze poised to strike, but Guan Yu recognized her voice as she whispered, “Guan Yu, are you inside?”

Cui Hua of the Echo Pavilion. Why visit now? The room fell silent until Wang Xiaorong snapped, “Are you deaf? Answer her!”

Grunting in annoyance, Guan Yu opened the door. Cui Hua entered, startled to find Wang Xiaorong among them.

“Young Mistress? Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be with the Demon Soul Sect in Duobao Mountain?”

“Can’t I visit my man?” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “Why are *you* here, skulking about at night?”

Cui Hua blanched at her boldness. “I came to discuss matters with Guan Yu. It seems ill-timed.”

“Speak freely,” Xiao Zhi encouraged.

Guan Yu closed the door. “How many has the Monster Demon Cave sent? What’s their plan?”

Cui Hua explained Xi Liu’s proposal: ally with Guan Yu against the Demon Soul Sect to prevent their acquisition of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. The Monster Demon Cave prioritized denying the technique to the Demon Soul Sect over claiming it themselves.

**Chapter 3519: Truly Irritating**

Cui Hua’s mission complicated by Wang Xiaorong’s presence. “Since when do righteous sects consort with the Demon Soul Sect?” she challenged.

“We don’t,” Xiao Zhi interjected. “She’s merely a stubborn pest.”

Relieved, Cui Hua addressed Guan Yu. “Xi Liu wishes to cooperate. Assist us against the Demon Soul Sect, and we’ll help you secure the technique.”

**Chapter 3520: Collaboration**

Guan Yu weighed the offer. Alliance with the Monster Demon Cave risked provoking the Demon Soul Sect further, but their forces were already entrenched. With Wang Xiaorong’s precarious position and the looming threat of both factions, cooperation might balance the scales.

“Very well,” Guan Yu agreed. “But any betrayal, and our accord ends.”

Cui Hua nodded. “Xi Liu anticipates your terms. We’ll signal when to strike.”

As they finalized plans, tensions simmered—a precarious alliance forged in the shadows of Duobao Mountain’s looming conflict.
