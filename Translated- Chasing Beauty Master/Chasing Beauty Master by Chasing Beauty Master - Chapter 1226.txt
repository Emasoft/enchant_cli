No one had expected that Second-to-Wolf would depart so abruptly, and Guan Yu offered no resistance as he was dragged away. The real test lay in observing Xuan Ming's reaction.

Elder Lu was first to block Guan Yu's path, chuckling amiably, "Guan Yu, this is all a misunderstanding. Why dwell on trivial matters? I, your Elder Lu, swear to announce your status publicly shortly. Every soul in Cloud Azure Mountain will know, and we'll retrieve your magic artifacts. Please calm your anger."

Guan Yu pouted exaggeratedly, feigning indignation. "Elder Lu, Elder Xuan, I first thank both of you for your care. Truly, I don't wish to leave, but I cannot stay here. Just moments ago, my life hung by a thread—I'm still trembling with fear!"

His self-sacrifice act required continuation. Second-to-Wolf barked, "Enough talk! Let's go!"

Xuan Ming interjected, "Guan Yu, Wei Shi acted rashly this time. Yet I'm curious—didn't I order Ling Su to escort you to Front Return Peak? How did you end up here?"

Earlier, Ling Su had complained to Xuan Ming, portraying Guan Yu as a brute who repaid kindness with violence by stabbing his wrist during the escort.

Recalling this, Guan Yu adopted a mournful tone. "I thought having two elders here meant I need fear nothing."

**Chapter 3150: You Are Not Welcome Here**

Guan Yu's strategy proved cunning. By invoking his "grandfathers'" status first, he emphasized closeness to these influential Cloud Azure Mountain figures regardless of audience.

He continued tearfully, "But upon returning from the back mountains, I was handed to an unfamiliar senior brother. When he glimpsed my magic artifact, murderous intent arose. I barely escaped by wounding his wrist and fleeing into unfamiliar woods. Lost, I stumbled here expecting aid, only to nearly lose my life. This place isn't for me—I must depart."

Regarding Ling Su—Xuan Ming's prized disciple—direct accusations lacked credibility. Framing it as artifact greed made plausible sense.

Guan Yu's pitiable recounting nearly moved even Dai Qianjie.

Given the covetable nature of Guan Yu's artifacts, Ling Su's temptation seemed natural. Xuan Ming grew anxious—losing Guan Yu after investing so many treasures would be disastrous.

Approaching Xuan Ming, Guan Yu murmured, "Master, I thank your concern, but I don't belong here. The artifacts from you and Elder Lu remain with Head Dai. Retrieve them later. Clearly, I'm unwelcome. Farewell."

As Guan Yu turned to leave with Second-to-Wolf, the elders struggled to devise retention arguments. On his first discipleship day, Guan Yu had already endured capture as a spy, interrogation, artifact confiscation, and near-death—unacceptable treatment for any newcomer.

Silence gripped the hall. Even Elder Lu faltered until Si Qi suddenly cried, "Guan Yu, wait!"

Stopping at the threshold, Guan Yu faced the unexpected interceptor. Si Qi pleaded, "If anger over my arrest drives you away, I'll accept any punishment from our sect leader. Please stay—none here despise you."

Meeting her limpid gaze, Guan Yu smiled gently. "I leave firstly to prove our innocence, sparing you punishment. Secondly, my departure isn't your fault. When others condemned me, only you spoke in my defense. For that, I thank you."

Hearing of Dai Qianjie's murder attempt, Xuan Ming glared furiously at his subordinate. Such reckless conduct without consultation tarnished sect dignity—now nearly costing them a precious disciple.

Pale and silent, Dai Qianjie recognized her blunder. A Boundary Master like Guan Yu represented immense value to cultivators. Her impulsive actions now threatened this asset.

Si Qi persisted, "Even if not for me, leaving over Aggregate Peak's actions shames us before the sect leader. Your departure would bring collective punishment. If grateful, stay and spare us this disgrace."

"Impossible, Master—ah, Sect Leader Xuan," Guan Yu corrected. "A sensible leader wouldn't punish you over a novice. Had Ling Su succeeded in killing me, none would've protested—a disposable newcomer's fate."

His bitter words discomforted Elder Lu, who interjected, "They acted unaware of your status as the sect leader's disciple! We'll announce it mountain-wide, granting unprecedented access to all areas except forbidden zones. Unheard-of privileges!"

Guan Yu remained noncommittal. His feigned exit required conviction—Ling Su's wrist injury demanded resolution. Without this performance, Xuan Ming might seek retribution for his favored disciple's wounding.

Lacking witnesses to Ling Su's artifact greed, Guan Yu's defensive act became aggression. Only exaggerated victimhood could obscure culpability.

"Elder Lu, I appreciate your kindness," Guan Yu lamented, "but Cloud Azure Mountain now haunts me with Ling Su's covetous shadows and Head Dai's murderous intent. Could any cultivation thrive under such darkness?"

**Chapter 3151: Most Welcomed**

Second-to-Wolf tugged Guan Yu's sleeve. "Enough prattle! Countless sects await beyond this den of snakes."

Alarmed, Xuan Ming blurted, "Guan Yu! Today's mishaps caught me unprepared. Though Cloud Azure Mountain disappointed you, Elder Lu's guarantees ensure future safety. Will you not reconsider?"

The sect leader dreaded Second-to-Wolf's point—rival sects would gladly nurture a Boundary Master. Worse, demonic factions might exploit this grievance.

Si Qi added, "Elder Lu's exceptional privileges exceed any disciple's待遇. Such favor still moves you not?"

Guan Yu shook his head mournfully. "Head Dai's grudge and Ling Su's vendetta promise future persecution. Why linger in peril when safer havens abound?"

As Si Qi conceded defeat, Xuan Ming reluctantly intervened—a sect leader personally entreating a novice risked embarrassment, yet Guan Yu's value justified it.

"Guan Yu," Xuan Ming intoned, "No sect matches our offerings. The artifacts we gifted—coveted by all cultivators—remain yours. Will you abandon them?"

Seizing the bait, Guan Yu whirled dramatically. "Sect Leader! Mentioning artifacts reminds me—Head Dai's murderous glare at the Emperor's Seal nearly slew me a thousandfold! Your timely arrival alone saved me."

"What?!" Xuan Ming thundered, rounding on Dai Qianjie. Elder Lu glared coldly. "Junior Sister Dai! A sect elder coveting a junior's artifact? Have you no shame?"

Xuan Ming roared, "So this explains your recklessness! Had you slain Guan Yu for the Emperor's Seal, you'd have been stripped of rank! Such base greed defiles our sect's honor!"

Trembling, Dai Qianjie whispered, "Sect Leader, I merely confiscated suspect stolen goods while summoning you. No murder intended."

"Lies!" Guan Yu pointed accusingly. "Only your disciples' presence stayed your hand—mass murder being too cumbersome. Admit your momentary lethal greed!"

Dai Qianjie hung her head—this junior's perception unnerved her. Xuan Ming decreed, "For disgracing our sect, Aggregate Peak enters year-long seclusion! Next offense brings rear mountain confinement!"

Gasps erupted. This harsh punishment excluded Aggregate Peak from the imminent Six Peaks Tournament—their greatest humiliation.

Dai Qianjie begged, "Sect Leader! Punish me alone! Don't deprive our disciples of the tournament!"

**Chapter 3152: Misjudging You**

Guan Yu hid a smirk—poetic justice for her persecution of Si Qi.

Elder Lu questioned, "Why display artifacts carelessly? Ling Su and Dai Qianjie's temptation stemmed from your recklessness."

Guan Yu explained, "Ling Su's negligent escort endangered me mid-flight. The artifact's exposure was accidental. Later, Head Dai threatened to cripple Si Qi—I revealed treasures to distract her, leading to confiscation."

Nods confirmed his logic. Revealing artifacts to save Si Qi justified the risk.

Si Qi implored, "Don't misjudge my master! Her strictness stems from concern for our cultivation. Please understand!"
