In society, the only place to taste genuine "fresh meat" was here. Jia Bo knew that despite Yaohua's outwardly provocative demeanor, she was actually quite conservative. He remembered an incident where an old man tried to win her over with money. Even when the tip reached 100,000 yuan, Yaohua flatly refused. This alone revealed her true character.

"Thank you, Sister Ji." After expressing his gratitude again, Jia Bo dragged away Wei Hongwei, whose eyes had gone rigid with shock. Later, when Yaohua entered the private room and discovered Li Yuan lying half-dead on the floor, she nearly jumped out of her skin.

"Oh heavens! This is terrifying! Someone call for help immediately! Don't let this bastard die in my room and ruin my business! Get someone to haul him away!" Yaohua screamed for assistance.

Eventually, an ambulance arrived after someone called emergency services, but by then Li Yuan had already sunk into a deep coma.

Wang Jun seethed with anger. She wouldn't let this matter rest. Riding her road racing motorcycle home, she took a long shower before sitting silently on the sofa, still shaken by today's events. It had been too close—if Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei hadn't appeared, she didn't dare imagine the consequences.

The silhouette of a young man flashed through her mind. He already treated her with indifference. Had Li Yuan succeeded today, she would have lost all face to pursue him. At this moment, Wang Jun made a resolution: she would never go out alone to drown her sorrows again.

When Wang Ting returned home and saw her younger brother sitting damp-haired on the sofa, clearly fresh from the shower, her heart ached. Though she knew her profound affection for him was taboo, emotions proved impossible to control once they took root.

Draped in a white bathrobe, Wang Jun appeared particularly vulnerable. Wang Ting approached softly, noticing his grim expression but attributing it to another drinking bout. Sitting beside him, she gently inquired, "You look troubled. What happened?"

"Do you know Li Yuan?" Wang Jun asked tonelessly. Wang Ting blinked in confusion. The name meant nothing to her, and she couldn't fathom why her beloved brother would ask.

Seeing his listlessness, she pressed with concern, "Tell me what's wrong."

Wang Jun leaned habitually against his sister's shoulder. "Do you know... I nearly had my purity stolen by Li Yuan today?"

"What?" Wang Ting gasped, fury flashing in her eyes. "Who is this Li Yuan? How dare he?"

As Wang Jun recounted the ordeal, both shuddered at the narrow escape. Wei Hongwei later pondered whether to inform Guan Yu. "Do you think this concerns Brother Guan?" he asked Jia Bo on their walk.

Jia Bo considered before smacking Wei Hongwei's head. "You idiot! Who cares if it's related? Just call him! Whether he acts is his business!"

Meanwhile, Guan Yu had just left Jinhua's place to escort Ling'er home. After receiving Wei Hongwei's call, he decided against involvement. Given Wang Jun's unexplained alliance with Cao Jin against him, he wanted no connection until matters were clarified.

Approaching Pantaisheng Apartments, a dark figure suddenly darted across the road. Guan Yu slammed on the brakes. The abrupt stop sent the unseatbelted Ling'er lurching forward. Instinctively, Guan Yu threw out an arm to block her fall—his hand landing squarely on her chest.

"Ouch!" Ling'er cried out, shooting him an accusatory look as she rubbed her sore breasts. But Guan Yu's attention fixed on the shadowy figure before their car.

"Ling'er, recognize him?" Guan Yu asked calmly. Peering through the windshield, Ling'er screamed at the spectral figure looming in the night.

Heart pounding but emboldened by Guan Yu's presence, she managed, "Brother Guan... is this some nighttime scam artist?"

**Chapter 2065: Being Tricked**

Guan Yu shook his head. "Remember your father mentioning his martial sister?" Ling'er gaped at the cloaked figure. "That's her? Why block us now?"

"Don't reveal your identity—it's dangerous," Guan Yu warned before exiting. He knew Qing Guanghui's embittered junior sister had waited decades to settle old romantic scores. Exposing Ling'er as Qing's daughter could prove fatal.

"Senior," Guan Yu addressed respectfully, "We bear no enmity. Why harass us?"

The figure remained shrouded in an oversized black coat, face hidden beneath a deep hood. "Spare the platitudes! Where's that old fool Qing?"

"He returned to the rainforest for snake gallbladder antidotes. The venom still threatens his life." Guan Yu's honesty earned a snarled "Lies!" Before he could react, the woman split into two shadowy duplicates.

She'd believed Ma Hai's claim about curing Qing's poison and absconding with Guan Yu. Now determined to force Qing's whereabouts, she attacked. Remembering Qing's advice about her photophobia, Guan Yu tried stalling—but she cleverly maintained only two clones to conserve energy.

Dancing around the clones' strikes, Guan Yu lured them to a brightly lit commercial district. As expected, the clones slowed under the glare. But just as he prepared to counterattack, all duplicates vanished into the crowd. Realization struck—she'd been toying with him all along.

Panicked she might target Ling'er, Guan Yu hailed a taxi. Returning, he found the woman gripping Ling'er's throat. "One month," she hissed, forcing a pill down the girl's throat. "Bring Qing, or she dies screaming."

**Chapter 2066: Unanswered**

Back home, Guan Yu checked Ling'er's meridians but found no abnormalities. "Maybe it's a bluff," Ling'er suggested, though Guan Yu dared not risk it. Qing's whereabouts remained unknown, lost in vast rainforests.

That night, Guan Yu's thoughts churned. He'd need to contact Qing somehow—even if through underworld channels. At Flower Night Club the next afternoon, Hou Jinshun shook his head at the request: "Tropical forests span continents. Finding one old man? Impossible."

Yet Guan Yu couldn't shake the image of Ling'er's frightened eyes. Whether trap or genuine threat, he'd move heaven and earth to protect her—even if it meant becoming the hunted himself.
