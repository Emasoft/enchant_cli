Elder Zheng also began to grow concerned. Xiao Zhi continued, “Father, the Demon Sect has gathered so many people here tonight. It’s time for them to act. What should we do?”

“Could we strike first in secret before they move?” Elder Zheng replied with a reluctant expression. “Two days ago, I reported to the Sect Leader and Master. I said other sects had sent large forces while we only have four people. I insisted we must reinforce our numbers, but Elder Mu stubbornly refused, claiming more people would only alert the enemy prematurely. So the matter was delayed.”

“Father, the Demon Sect’s experts have all gathered at Uncle’s residence. If we act here, this place will become a battlefield. Uncle’s family will be in grave danger,” Xiao Zhi argued.

Guan Yu interjected, “It’s too late for words now. The Demon Sect’s experts are all here—not to mention that fox demon, there’s also the Azure Dragon Left Envoy. The four of us are no match for them. We can’t provoke trouble. We can only wait and see how things unfold.”

Elder Zheng sighed. “This is all Elder Mu’s fault. Who knows what he was thinking? Regrets are useless now.” After a pause, he added, “None of you should act recklessly. Charging into certain death is folly. Guan Yu is right—we must observe how events unfold.”

“There’s another matter,” Guan Yu said. “I’ve heard Meng Hua the Ancient Ancestor set countless traps and mechanisms within Duobao Mountain (Treasure Mountain). Let the Demon Sect members trigger them first. Once the defenses are disabled, we can follow.”

“Exactly! Do not act impulsively. The Azure Dragon Left Envoy is no trivial foe,” Elder Zheng warned gloomily. “I’ll seek the Sect Leader’s decision now.” He deactivated the Black Yuanbao communication device.

Aze protested, “Are we truly to sit here idly?”

“What else would you suggest?” Guan Yu snapped. “I’ll scout the situation. The three of you stay in this room. Do not wander off—understood?”

“Guan Yu,” Xiao Zhi ventured, “shouldn’t we inform Aunt? This crisis unfolds in her home. Is ignorance truly better?”

“No! Their ignorance may protect them. Even if they knew, what could they do? The Demon Sect holds overwhelming numbers. Knowledge would only mark them for slaughter,” Guan Yu countered. “Stay here. I’ll investigate.”

As Guan Yu swaggered toward the artificial hill, darkness had fallen. The Demon Sect’s move was imminent.

Before reaching the rear mountains, he overheard loud voices ahead—the Demon Sect clearly regarded this territory as theirs, dismissing all threats. Perhaps they believed Guan Yu’s group posed no danger, especially with the Azure Dragon Left Envoy present.

“Fox, your cruelty knows bounds. I said kill two to intimidate, yet you slaughtered over a dozen. Excessive, don’t you think?” a voice chided.

A shrill retort followed: “Since when does our Left Envoy care? We’re the Demon Sect—killing is our nature! Lately, you sound like some righteous fool. Do you mourn these dead?”

Crouching in shadows, Guan Yu spotted two figures: the Azure Dragon Left Envoy and the effeminate man from earlier—undoubtedly the fox demon.

The Left Envoy chuckled. “Perhaps I overthink. I merely feared your delicate frame might tire. No deeper meaning intended.”

“Hah! The Left Envoy concerned for me? How novel!” the fox demon sneered. “I eliminated witnesses to maintain our cover. With rumors spreading about disturbances in the Qin Estate, our sudden influx of ‘recruits’ would raise suspicion otherwise.”

Steward Sun approached, bowing. “Left Envoy, we’ve installed climbing stairs by the artificial hill. Shall we proceed?”

“Fox, let’s lead the vanguard,” the Left Envoy declared, gesturing forward.

“Wait for me! Such fun needs my presence!” a girl’s voice trilled. Guan Yu immediately recognized Wang Xiaorong’s tone.

Emerging from the Demon Sect crowd, Wang Xiaorong grinned at the Left Envoy. “Young Mistress! Why are you here?” the Left Envoy demanded, glaring accusingly at Steward Sun.

“Why shouldn’t I come? Excitement requires my touch!” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “Don’t blame Old Sun—he never noticed me among the men. If I’d been easily spotted, would I deserve being the Demon Soul Sect’s Young Mistress?”

“Young Mistress!” The fox demon and Steward Sun bowed simultaneously. None had anticipated the sect leader’s daughter disguising herself among male recruits.

Chapter 3506: Absolutely Not

The Left Envoy grimaced. This mischievous heir had slipped past his notice—no surprise given her legendary infiltration skills.

“Young Mistress, Duobao Mountain’s interior is fraught with deadly traps. You cannot enter—it’s too perilous,” the Left Envoy insisted.

“Nonsense! I’ll see what’s inside. Why else would I come?” Wang Xiaorong pouted. “If this stinking fox can enter, why not me?”

The fox demon winced at the insult but remained silent. Having owed his life to her after she rescued him from assassins, he endured her pranks without complaint.

“This mission is critical. I beg you—do not interfere,” the Left Envoy pleaded. “If the Demon Lord learns of your presence, I’ll be severely punished. Would you wish that?”

“Your punishment isn’t my concern! Tell Father you didn’t recognize me. My disguises fool even him sometimes!”

Steward Sun interjected respectfully, “Young Mistress, heed the Left Envoy. Remain here for safety.”

“I’m coming! With so many protectors, what could go wrong?” Wang Xiaorong stamped her foot. “If you’re all useless, I’ll flee danger myself!”

“No! This time I refuse!” The Left Envoy stood firm. “Even if you complain to the Demon Lord or demand my execution—I won’t yield!”

Wang Xiaorong blinked, unaccustomed to defiance from the usually indulgent Left Envoy. Knowing even her father would support his stance, she relented: “Fine! To avoid ruining your plans, I’ll stay. Happy?”

Secretly, she plotted to find Guan Yu first, then trail the group later.

“Thank you for understanding,” the Left Envoy said, relieved. Wang Xiaorong’s safety meant more than his life.

Wang Xiaorong waved dismissively. “I’ll amuse myself elsewhere. Carry on!” She skipped away, chanting, “Guan Yu, where are you? Heehee!”

She passed Guan Yu’s hiding spot. Though reluctant to engage, Guan Yu realized accompanying her might grant safer access to the mountain under her protection.

Tracking her movements, Guan Yu noted she headed straight for his quarters—how did she know his location?

At his door, Wang Xiaorong knocked. “Guan Yu! Are you there? Come out, you big dummy!”

Inside, Xiao Zhi whispered, “The Demon Soul Sect’s Young Mistress here? They treat this place as their own!”

Siqi fretted, “We should check on Guan Yu. He’s alone against so many—”

Her raised voice carried outside. Wang Xiaorong’s eyes narrowed. “You rotten Guan Yu! No wonder you ignored me—hiding some woman inside!” she shrieked. “Come out now, you shameless cheat!”

Chapter 3507: Unsettled Expressions

Guan Yu lurked by the corner, exasperated by the accusations. He waited, timing his appearance.

Inside, Siqi’s jealousy flared. “Xiao Zhi, send her away. Say Guan Yu’s out.”

Xiao Zhi hesitated. “She’s relentless. She’ll wait indefinitely.”

“Then I’ll tell her,” Siqi declared, storming out. “Stop shouting! People need rest!”

“Well! Guan Yu’s little junior sister,” Wang Xiaorong taunted, hands on hips. “What’s a girl doing in a man’s room at night? How brazen!”

Siqi coldly retorted, “My whereabouts are none of your concern. At least I’m welcomed here. Unlike some, screaming at closed doors.”

Aze and Xiao Zhi gaped at Siqi’s uncharacteristic sharpness. Guan Yu winced at the palpable tension.

Wang Xiaorong reddened. “You—! Tell that cheat Guan Yu I’m not done with him!” She stormed off, leaving Siqi victorious yet unsettled by her own unspoken fears.
