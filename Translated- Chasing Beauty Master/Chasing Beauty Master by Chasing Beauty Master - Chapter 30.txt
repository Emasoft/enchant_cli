Under the intermittent stolen glances from Guan Yu, Feng Xin’s heart fluttered uncontrollably. Several times she nearly scolded him or glared his way, but each time she reluctantly held back. *Let him look,* she resigned herself. *A brat experiencing his first crush…*

Moreover, being adored by such a youth indirectly affirmed her allure. And this sensation… it wasn’t entirely unpleasant!

**Chapter 71: Had Enough of Looking?**

The two ate in silence, Guan Yu’s furtive gazes grating on Feng Xin’s nerves until she longed to pluck his eyes out.

*Strangely,* Guan Yu mused, *this manly woman grows more agreeable to the eye the longer I look. Undeniably, she’s a true beauty. Pity her temper’s so dreadful. And those clothes! What a waste of such curves…*

“Finished?” Feng Xin dabbed her lips elegantly with a handkerchief. “Grandfather wishes to see you this afternoon. I’ll take you.”

“Uh… yes! Almost done!” Guan Yu eyed the remaining feast mournfully. *Such waste! Could I take leftovers?* He discarded the thought. *Risk angering her? Not worth losing my chance to learn martial arts.*

Exiting the hotel, Guan Yu gaped as Feng Xin opened a black Mercedes. *Other girls favor pink sports cars or cute Beetles. How unconventional.*

*A gang’s big sister parading in a Beetle?* He smirked, sliding into the passenger seat. *This suits her better.*

Feng Xin reversed smoothly from the parking lot without sparing him a glance.

“Can you drive?” she asked flatly.

“Hmm?”

“Bicycles!” He grinned, hoping to amuse her. Instead, she shot him a venomous glare.

*No humor allowed, apparently.*

“I can… but no license.”

“Register for one tomorrow.”

The stifling silence pressed on Guan Yu. His eyes wandered rebelliously from her cropped hair down to her neckline and—

*Those twin peaks… how tantalizing! To squeeze them—* He jerked his gaze away. *Better not provoke the tigress.*

Resisting proved futile. Soon he peeked at her thighs beneath tailored slacks. *Perfect legs. Imagine them in skirts and stockings… What a waste on such an ice queen.*

Feng Xin’s jaw tightened. *I’ll bite this punk raw!*

“Enough staring!” she barked, halting at a villa’s gates. “We’re here. Out!”

Blushing, Guan Yu obeyed. The manicured gardens with fountains and flowerbeds left him awestruck. *Extravagant as a painting!*

“Seen enough? Inside!” Feng Xin marched ahead.

Trailing her, Guan Yu’s eyes lingered on her swaying hips. *A tragedy,* he sighed inwardly.

Catching his leer, Feng Xin whirled, livid. “Where’re your eyes wandering, pervert?!”

“Ah… Just call me Guan Yu!” He scratched his neck, embarrassed.

“Hmph!” She clenched her fists, restraining violence.

“Xin-jie… a suggestion?” he ventured.

She ignored him.

“Your legs and figure—they’d stun in skirts. More suitors would—”

“You—!” She stormed inside, quivering with rage.

*My goodwill earns glares?* He trailed her miserably.

The opulent parlor confirmed the owners’ wealth.

“Grandfather, here’s your man,” Feng Xin announced wearily to the dozing elder.

“Ah, Guan Yu? Sit.” Master Feng waved dismissively.

“No need, Master! I’ll stand!” Guan Yu fawned. *My future hinges on this!*

“Master?!” Feng Xin gaped. “Grandfather, when did you—?”

“Oh, didn’t I mention? I’ll teach him our Bone-Shattering Fist.”

“WHAT?!” Her eyes bulged. “Our ancestral art—passed only to family! You vowed to teach my future husband!”

“Aging changes plans. You won’t wed, and the art dies with me. Guan Yu’s righteous, skilled—ideal.”

**Chapter 72: Trial**

Feng Xin pouted. “Why must men inherit it? I’ve trained years!”

“Female physique suits softer styles. You’ve barely scratched the first tier.”

“But him? You barely know him!”

“He defended a girl single-handedly at your club. Worthy.”

“I refuse!” She shook his arm. “Find another!”

“He’ll protect you.”

“Him? Scrawny rat!”

“Test them, then.” Master Feng gestured upstairs. “Training hall—compare strength.”

The gymnasium boasted wooden dummies and weights.

“How’s this fair?” Guan Yu muttered. *With gravity magic, 150-pound lifts? Child’s play.*

Feng Xin reappeared in workout gear—crop top and shorts—revealing toned abs and legs. Guan Yu ogled, transfixed.

“Enjoying?” she hissed.

“You’re… stunning!”

Flustered, she adjusted weights. “Begin!”

**Chapter 73: Madwoman!**

They faced off with barbells.

Feng Xin hoisted hers effortlessly, pride fueling each lift. *I’ll prove women surpass men!*

Guan Yu activated gravity reduction. The weight halved. *Easy victory.*

“Still smirking?” she spat.

Master Feng left, chuckling. “Inform me after.”

As Feng Xin strained, sweat glistening, Guan Yu’s gaze drifted lower—

“PERVERT!” She lunged, barbell swinging.

“Crazy bitch!” He ducked. *So much for chivalry!*
