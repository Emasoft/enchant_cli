“You always know how to spout nonsense. What does a child like you understand?” Aunt reprimanded disapprovingly, though her gaze at Guan Yu seemed slightly peculiar.

Guan Yu looked helplessly at Lin Qiaoqiao, his unspoken words written plainly on his face: *You let the secret slip. You handle this mess yourself.*

Lin Qiaoqiao muttered gloomily, “Aunt, you’ve misunderstood. I was just joking with Guan Yu earlier. This blockhead is lucky to have met me. How could there possibly be another woman? Hahaha…”

Aunt chuckled. “Goodness, you gave me quite a fright! I was thinking—any man should be content to meet a beauty like you. How could he still go looking for other women?”

“It’s all her reckless talk. There’s no such thing,” Guan Yu said helplessly. He couldn’t let Aunt’s family learn about his true background. If they found out, Lin Zhonggeng would likely know soon too.

*Best to keep this hidden for now,* Lin Qiaoqiao thought. As for her future with Guan Yu… she’d decide as circumstances unfolded. Still, she’d already chosen him. Her cheeks flushed as memories of last night surfaced.

She’d slept naked in Guan Yu’s bed—her first time sharing such intimacy with a man. Though nothing improper occurred, she’d barely slept, finally dozing off near dawn. Despite her shyness, being close to him felt… sweet. The only irritant had been Xiao Zhu’s presence. That fifteen-year-old girl acted strangely possessive, as if competing for Guan Yu. *I’ll never let my cousin steal him,* Lin Qiaoqiao vowed.

Guan Yu changed the subject. “It’s still early. Since Uncle’s here—and he grew up in this village—could you tell us more about the great tree at the entrance? We’d love to hear its story.”

“Yes, he knows far more than I do. Go on, tell them,” Aunt urged.

Uncle smiled and sat down. “The tale of that tree comes from elders. Whether it’s true, I can’t say.”

“We just want the story,” Lin Qiaoqiao insisted.

“Long ago, this was flat woodland without surrounding hills. A pair of immortals arrived bearing a seed from another realm. They planted it, and a sapling sprouted swiftly. But lacking water, the immortals reshaped the land with divine power—raising earth into surrounding mountains. Streams flowed down to nourish the sapling, which grew into a massive tree a meter thick.”

“The immortals settled here to guard their creation. When they eventually departed, they compelled several humans to remain as caretakers—branding them to eternally protect the tree. Thus, our village formed.”

“Our valley’s structure is the immortals’ work. Though encircled by mountains, no storm or flood touches us. The Sacred Tree ensures rainwater flows safely through its stream. Once, during terrible floods, waters rose a meter high yet never breached our homes. We bow to the tree when passing—it demands respect to maintain our protection.”

Guan Yu marveled, “So it’s not of this world? Repelling floods is astonishing!” He’d noticed the basin’s geography earlier. Without divine intervention, the village should flood annually.

“Incredible!” Lin Qiaoqiao exclaimed. “That ancient tree even formed a natural bridge over its stream. Does it have other powers?”

Uncle shook his head. “Its leaves stay green year-round, barely falling. But they’re lethally poisonous. Decades ago, a child died after pricking his finger on one. His corpse turned green, triggering a plague that nearly wiped us out. A wandering sage saved us, warning never to touch the tree.”

“How terrifying!” Lin Qiaoqiao gasped. “It protects yet endangers us?”

“Perhaps it punishes disrespect,” Uncle mused.

Guan Yu realized the tree was both deity and tyrant to villagers—a revered idol demanding absolute obedience. Offending it meant disaster.

**Chapter 3083: The Legend (Part 2)**

Village rules forbade children from playing near the Sacred Tree. Disrespect meant severe punishment. Guan Yu pondered: *This otherworldly plant thrives on water. It doesn’t repel floods—it devours them.* During storms, it greedily absorbed rainfall, preventing floods but leaving surrounding vegetation parched. The dwindled stream suggested it once drank from a mighty river.

*Clever tree,* he thought. *It takes just enough water to sustain the ecosystem while hoarding the rest.* Yet its toxic presence oppressed the village. Modernity flourished in nearby towns, but this place remained a backward enclave—isolated, impoverished, trapped by devotion to their arboreal overlord.

“Any other legends?” Guan Yu asked.

Uncle lowered his voice. “There’s more, but we’re forbidden to tell outsiders. If the chief knew…”

Guan Yu started as faint breathing sounded behind him. Xiao Zhu had fallen asleep against his back. Aunt carried the girl to bed, then addressed the couple: “Qiaoqiao, will you two mind sleeping in the inner room?”

Lin Qiaoqiao flushed but didn’t protest. The main room’s heated bed accommodated three; only the inner chamber remained. Aunt clearly intended to nudge the “engaged” pair closer.

**Chapter 3084: The Legend (Conclusion)**

The inner room held a simple wardrobe and wooden bench. Lin Qiaoqiao burrowed under quilts, face hidden. Guan Yu tactfully avoided teasing her—her fiery temper simmered beneath the shyness. The bed’s hardness contrasted with modern mattresses, but warmth seeped through the bricks. Outside, the family’s soft breaths mingled as Guan Yu lay still, respecting Qiaoqiao’s nervous stillness.
