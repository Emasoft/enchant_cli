Wang Xiaojun straightened his posture and declared solemnly, "My master is preparing to undergo a tribulation. This celestial trial is perilous beyond measure, requiring Daoist Wild Crane's protective assistance."

"Yet the Heavy Sword Sect boasts countless experts," Guan Yu inquired. "Why seek external guardians?"

"This..." Wang Xiaojun stammered, hesitation etched across his features. Sensing his reluctance to elaborate, Wild Crane Daoist and Guan Yu exchanged glances before preparing to take their leave. Time pressed urgently—tonight's full moon demanded their cultivation efforts, daylight hours already being pressed into service.

Having received numerous kindnesses from Wang Xiaojun, Guan Yu felt compelled to offer some gesture. "Though we cannot aid in this matter," he ventured, "did you not mention your master assigned two tasks before entering the mortal realm? What was the second?"

Wang Xiaojun's discomfort deepened as he averted his gaze. "The second... was to kill you."

Silence crystallized the air. Wang Xiaojun's deadly earnestness permitted no jest. Guan Yu hastily fabricated an excuse to depart—neither request could he fulfill.

......

Beneath the luminous full moon, Guan Yu absorbed celestial energies through his breathing exercises. The fatigue of flesh dissolved as his cultivation advanced. Upon reaching the Golden Core stage, an inner core would form within him—transcending mortal sustenance and worldly attachments, ascending to true immortalhood. Opening his eyes, Guan Yu felt impurities purged, spirit invigorated.

Three figures materialized from the shadows: Wild Crane Daoist, Wan Qingyang, and Liao Yuntian.

"Impressive progress," Wild Crane appraised Guan Yu.

"Yet the Golden Core remains elusive," Guan Yu sighed.

"That threshold between mortality and dao proves treacherous," the elder stroked his sparse beard. "Should you fail to break through before the Dharma Assembly, we shall focus on mastering spells. Now—spar with Yuntian once more."

......

Days of companionship had forged mutual respect between Liao Yuntian and Guan Yu. With eagle-like precision, Liao leapt backward, adopting a combat stance.

Guan Yu's instincts flared—this Liao radiated unprecedented danger.

**BOOM!** Liao descended like a meteor, crushing force emanating from his stomp. Guan Yu's fists met the assault head-on, spiritual energy colliding in thunderous concussion.

Blood surged in Guan Yu's throat as he staggered back. Before recovery came Liao's follow-up strike. Seizing his opponent's meridian point, Guan Yu channeled energy to numb the limb—only for Liao to shift momentum through shoulder rotation.

To observers, their clash appeared instantaneous—contact and separation within eyeblinks.

Liao's superior cultivation showed through refined control. Yet inspiration struck Guan Yu—why not test Wang Xiaojun's Nine Seals technique?

**Chapter 1129: Liu Zizai**

Roaring, Guan Yu charged with hand-seals blazing. Surging qi manifested as tsunami-force waves, destabilizing even Liao's seasoned composure.

Belatedly raising defenses, Liao found himself overwhelmed. Kneeling under the assault, he stared incredulously at his erstwhile inferior. Guan Yu's heart soared—mastery of the Nine Seals promised imminent supremacy!

"Remarkable!" Wild Crane's eyes gleamed. "These enhanced Nine Seals—could they be the Heavy Sword Sect's Essential Mantra?"

Guan Yu's hoped-for surprise evaporated under the elder's discernment. Liao's competitive spirit reignited, curiosity overriding defeat. Though willing to share the technique for future alliance, Guan Yu puzzled—why would Wang Xiaojun impart lethal secrets while plotting his demise?

......

"Enough. This path ill-suits me," Liao coldly declined after struggling with the esoteric seals. "Regarding your inquiry into the three sects—developments have emerged."

Investigations revealed multiple cultivation factions converging on Linchuan University—Heavy Sword Sect being but one. The Dragon Group's decades of mortal protection meant nothing to these immortal aspirants who revered only Enforcers.

"Could Linchuan's spiritual currents surpass even the three sects' blessed lands?"

Guan Yu scoffed. Immortals coveting this place implied extraordinary energies.

"Impossible," Wild Crane countered. "Their ancestral realms overflow with thousandfold potency. Their purpose here lies elsewhere."

"Shall I arrange their forcible assembly?" Liao proposed.

Guan Yu inwardly shuddered—Wang Xiaojun's dual missions proved extreme solutions bred extreme intents.

......

Dawn's darkest hour found Guan Yu confronting a silhouette—the same shadow that aided him against illusion arts earlier. Their silent communion broke as the figure vanished into woodland.

Pursuit led Guan Yu through stygian depths until feminine desperation pierced the gloom: "Help!"

Groping downward, his hand closed on an icy, trembling wrist. He hauled up a mud-caked figure—not the shadow, but a disheveled cultivator.

"Gratitude, fellow daoist," the shivering woman composed herself. "Liu Zizai of Carefree Sect. May I know your..."

"A cultivator?" Guan Yu marveled. Carefree Sect's presence confirmed Liao's reports—all three great sects had infiltrated the university.

......

**Chapter 1130: Liu Rush**

"Senior Brother summoned me via astral message," Liu Zizai revealed, eyes dimming. "A trap awaited."

Factional strife even among transcendent sects—Guan Yu marveled at the irony. "The culprit?"

"Unknown."

Recalling the Dragon Group's planned conclave, Guan Yu offered alliance. Liu Zizai readily accepted, directing him to her sect's leader—Liu Rush.

"Why do sects converge here?"

"Carefree seeks an artifact," she shrugged. "Lower disciples know little."

......

Dawn found Guan Yu seeking Liu Rush's classroom. A meditating man exuded ageless cultivation aura—yet emitted no detectable energy. As Guan Yu turned to leave, a hand clamped his shoulder.

"Identify yourselves!" snapped a narrow-eyed youth.

The meditator stirred. "I am Liu Rush," he smirked. "And you?"

Before Guan Yu could respond, the cultivator's gaze turned contemptuous. "Ah—a Foundation Establishment gnat and Golden Core trash."

Derisive laughter erupted.

"Your sect's dogs surpass me?" Guan Yu retorted, nodding at the Core Formation guard.

Rage ignited. Slaps resounded as Leopard (Bao) intercepted attacks meant for Guan Yu. When the loyal subordinate lunged vengefully, a Silent Spirit cultivator effortlessly restrained him.

"Destroy this vermin's spiritual roots," Liu Rush commanded.

As energies gathered for the crippling strike, Guan Yu realized—these immortal disciples considered mortals as insects. But Leopard was no insect—he was brother.
