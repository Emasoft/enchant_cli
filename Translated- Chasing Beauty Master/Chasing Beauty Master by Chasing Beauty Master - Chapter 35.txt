While driving, Feng Xin occasionally stole glances at Guan Yu’s expression, only to find him gazing out the window at the night scenery, lost in thought. Equally reserved by nature, Feng Xin made no effort to break the silence, leaving the atmosphere heavy.

“Where are you getting off?” she asked casually, glancing at him.

“The main gate of N University is fine.” The guesthouse was just across the road from the campus, making the entrance convenient.

As she drove, Feng Xin wrinkled her nose slightly, frowning at Guan Yu. Whether from exercise or not, he carried a strong, musky scent—unmistakably masculine. She pursed her lips but said nothing.

When they reached the university gate, Guan Yu thanked her and moved to exit. Tilting her head, Feng Xin remarked coolly, “Remember to shower before bed. And… those clothes need changing.”

Guan Yu glanced down at his wrinkled shirt, flushing slightly. He nodded and stepped out.

Most of his clothes were still in his cousin’s wife’s dorm. What he wore now were the same clothes he’d arrived in days ago. His other set, stained with blood during his confrontation with Wang Fubin, had been discarded.

Watching Feng Xin drive away, Guan Yu suspiciously lifted his collar to sniff. No odor. Shaking his head in confusion, he walked back to the guesthouse.

Early the next morning, refreshed and alone, Guan Yu began his planned workout. After devouring several lollipops to replenish his energy, he activated his Gravity Art.

Instantly, his body felt encased in leaden armor. Gritting his teeth, he lowered himself into a push-up position.

The essence of the Bone-Crushing Fist lay in speed and force, demanding rigorous arm and core strength. Greater muscle elasticity meant faster, deadlier strikes—making physical training paramount.

Under 0.4x gravity, fifty push-ups felt like lifting weights. By the end, his arms trembled, drenched in sweat.

After using Healing Art to recover, Guan Yu focused on squats—leg strength had always been his priority. He envied martial artists’ whip kicks and aerial combos.

*Hands guard the gates, but legs deliver the blows.* Mastery of leg power could end fights instantly. Even the Bone-Crushing Fist’s finishing moves relied on sweeping kicks to disrupt balance.

Hours later, muscles quivering and stomach growling, Guan Yu finally stopped. Having regenerated energy four times, he wiped off sweat and donned his shirt, heading to retrieve his clothes.

Before leaving, two knocks sounded at his door.

*Who’d visit me here?* In this city, he only knew a handful of people—all women. Puzzled, he opened the door.

“Senior Sister? Why are you…” He blinked. Du XiaoJuan stood there, radiant in a breezy dress and beige shoes, smiling brightly.

“Just checking on you!” She grabbed his arm cheerfully. “What’re you up to?”

*Two days since the incident… why’s she still clinging?* Guan Yu wondered if she remained traumatized from the fall.

“About to grab breakfast. Join me?” He smiled at the girl glued to his arm, enjoying her childlike affection despite her immaturity.

“Sure! I barely ate.” She beamed up at him.

“By the way,” she added coyly, “Auntie said those two who harassed me are hospitalized with serious injuries. Was that… you?”

“No,” Guan Yu coughed. He saw no need to boast.

“Whoever did it, I’m grateful!” She giggled, tightening her grip as they descended.

“Hey… did you think about me yesterday?”

Blushing, Du XiaoJuan’s question stunned him. *Is this a confession?* His heart raced. *Am I about to escape singlehood before term starts?*

She was adorable, doll-like… but he preferred mature women. A dilemma.

**Chapter Eighty-Three: Counterfeit Money Incident**

At a small diner near the guesthouse, Guan Yu and Du XiaoJuan ordered breakfast. The cramped space held three tables, walls plastered with handwritten menus. Only they and a towering newcomer occupied the room.

The newcomer—over six feet tall, built like a tank—slumped by the entrance with a military satchel. “Three steamers of buns! Congee! Pickles!” His voice boomed like thunder.

Guan Yu observed the boy’s weathered face. *Another freshman?*

As their food arrived, the giant devoured his meal, cheeks bulging. “Check!” he garbled through mouthfuls.

The bespectacled owner approached. “Eighteen yuan.”

The boy fished out crisp hundred-yuan notes. The owner took one, then stealthily swapped it for a limp counterfeit from a shoebox cash register.

“This bill’s bad. Swap it,” the owner insisted.

“The hell?” The boy slammed the table. “I gave you a new note! This rag’s fake!”

Denials erupted until the owner’s pudgy son emerged, escalating to fists. When the son fetched a meat cleaver, the giant whipped out a gleaming machete from his satchel.

“STOP!” Guan Yu intervened, blocking the clash. He berated the owner: “Scamming over 100 yuan? Your son’s life worth so little?”

Shamed, the owner returned the real bill. The giant snorted, “Saved your fun, huh?” but sheathed his blade.

**Chapter Eighty-Four: Not Bad, This Guy**

The giant’s explosive temper reminded Guan Yu of the Black Whirlwind from *Water Margin*. Only his Gravity Art-enhanced speed prevented bloodshed.

“Petty scams aren’t worth dying over,” Guan Yu lectured the trembling owner before resuming breakfast. Du XiaoJuan clung to him, wide-eyed.

The giant paid properly, grudgingly nodding at Guan Yu. “Could’ve had fun… but you’re alright.”

As chaos settled, Guan Yu mused: *This guy’s trouble… but interesting.*
