“What do you mean by this, Guan Yu? Are you saying her breasts are beautiful, or that the scenery hidden beneath them is alluring?”

...

“Also, why would a massage require removing this thing? It’s clearly just an excuse—your lecherous excuse!”

...

Seeing Feng Xin hesitate to proceed, Guan Yu realized her misunderstanding. Without another word, he kneaded the soft mounds, weary yet exhilarated.

...

“Ah...”

...

The physical pleasure drew another moan from Feng Xin—long, melodic, rising and falling in pitch, stirring Guan Yu’s restless desires.

...

“Oh...”

...

Overwhelmed by the heat coursing through her body and the stimulation from her compressed breasts, Feng Xin teetered on the brink of ecstasy.

...

While she reveled in pleasure, Guan Yu suffered.

...

His grip tightened as he glared at her. “Stop moaning—I’m treating you!”

...

**Chapter 743: Recovery**

...

Feng Xin seethed inwardly—why must he bark orders during a simple treatment?

...

Guan Yu felt equally aggrieved. Healing her demanded immense physical and mental exertion. Resisting the temptation of her body and now her moans—so akin to lovemaking sounds he’d heard from Wenqing and Liu Shilei—pushed him to the edge.

...

“Turn over and lie face down,” he ordered gruffly.

...

“My back too?” Feng Xin frowned.

...

“Of course—this is a full-body burn. Comprehensive care is needed.”

...

After preliminary treatments, most of Feng Xin’s burns had healed, leaving only minor scars and residual toxins. Guan Yu’s meticulous massage, guided by his healing system, eradicated every trace. Any physician witnessing this would’ve been astounded.

...

Exhausted, Guan Yu declared, “Done!”

...

Feng Xin sprang up, glaring. “Pervert!”

...

“Medical necessity,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Your body’s purged toxins—feel the stickiness and odor? That’s detoxification. Your skin will glow anew.”

...

“Then why remove my underwear?!”

...

“To prevent... exposure,” Guan Yu stammered, avoiding her gaze.

...

“Liar!” Feng Xin spat, covering herself and fleeing to the bathroom.

...

Moments later, a crash echoed. Rushing in, Guan Yu slipped on soap and collapsed atop her.

...

**Chapter 745: Inescapable Fate**

...

Their entangled bodies froze. Guan Yu’s hardened member pressed against Feng Xin’s core, igniting primal urges.

...

“Bastard—get off!” Feng Xin hissed, yet her traitorous body responded.

...

“Xin’er... I love you,” Guan Yu murmured, capturing her lips in a searing kiss.

...

Lost in passion, Feng Xin surrendered, whispering, “Be good to me...”
