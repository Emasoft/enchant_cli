“Aiyo… don’t, don’t hit! Let’s talk this through!” Wang Fubin hadn’t expected the other party to deny him any chance to posture. Seeing himself about to be thrashed, he hastily shrunk back and stammered repeatedly.

“You little bastard think you can swagger here? Settle your bill and scram!” Without bothering for explanations, several burly bouncers grew more emboldened as Wang Fubin backed down, barking threats.

Wang Fubin’s face darkened further. Noticing Fu Linlin and other girls staring at him in shock, his pallor turned ashen—this humiliation was unbearable!

The “brothers” he’d brought along stood frozen, useless as expected.

“Brothers, where’s Tiger? Tell him to come out!” Wang Fubin straightened his collar, squared his shoulders, and adopted a domineering tone.

“Oh? You know Tiger? No wonder you’ve got the guts to act tough!” The chubby leader eyed Wang Fubin skeptically before jerking his chin. “Go upstairs and fetch Tiger! Kid, what’s your deal? Smashing tables and wrecking the place?”

Recognizing Wang Fubin might actually know their boss, the man stepped forward, slapped Wang’s shoulder, and offered a cigarette.

“F***… came for a drink, but your damn waiter messed with me! This bottle cap flew up and gashed my face!” Wang Fubin indignantly pointed at his bruised cheekbone.

Leaning against a chairback with casual amusement, Guan Yu observed Wang Fubin. So this wasn’t just a rich brat—he had underworld connections. No wonder the arrogance.

As Guan Yu watched, a man descended the stairs—sleeveless shirt, gold chain thick as a pinky finger around his neck, jowls wobbling comically. Despite his bulk, three deep forehead creases and piercing eyes lent him a fierce aura. “Who’s this bigshot demanding my presence?” Tiger grumbled while swaying forward.

Wang Fubin spun around. “Brother Tiger! Just here for drinks—little misunderstanding with your men!”

“Well, well… Fubin! What’s with your face? Looks like a dog pissed on it!” Tiger guffawed, slapping his thigh.

Wang Fubin’s plan to salvage pride via Tiger backfired spectacularly. As Du Xiaojuan giggled beside Guan Yu—“That fat man’s hilarious! ‘Dog piss’ fits perfectly!”—Wang’s face twitched with rage.

Spotting Guan Yu and Du’s mocking smirks, Wang exploded: “Laughing at me, you motherf***ers? You wanna die?”

Though Du’s laughter stung, Wang knew better than to provoke her. Guan Yu, however, seemed an easy target—a poor pushover who’d endured earlier taunts silently.

Bullies prey on weakness. Seizing the chance, Wang slammed the table, snatched a bottle, and jabbed it at Guan Yu’s face. “What’s so funny, trash?”

In a blur, Guan Yu rose. His fist shattered the bottle mid-swing before his palm cracked across Wang’s cheek.

The room froze. No one anticipated Guan Yu’s lethal speed—one moment smiling, the next striking with brutal precision.

Sprawled on the floor clutching his face, Wang gaped. “Y-you dare hit me?!”

Eyes icy, Guan Yu kicked a chair aside and lunged, stomping Wang’s mouth. Teeth split lips as blood dribbled down.

“I’ll… I’ll…” Wang’s threats died under Guan Yu’s murderous glare. Scrambling beneath a table, he emerged on the other side, pointing shakily. “Y-you’ll pay for this!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Keep barking. Every word earns another beating.”

Tiger stormed over, swiping at Guan Yu’s head. “You hit my brother in front of me?!”

Ducking the slap, Guan Yu seized Tiger’s chain and twisted. Metal bit into flabby neck flesh as a knee rammed the gangster’s gut.

“What if I did?” Guan Yu hissed, yanking Tiger close.

“L-let’s talk… civilized men use words!” Tiger wheezed, voice shrill as a eunuch’s.

A henchman lunged with a dagger. Guan Yu pivoted, caught the blade barehanded, and kicked. Gravity magic amplified the blow, sending the thug flying like cannon fodder.

Holding the bloodied knife, Guan Yu pressed its tip to Tiger’s eyeball. “Still want trouble?”

Time seemed to freeze. The trembling blade hovered millimeters from Tiger’s retina, a crimson droplet quivering at its edge.

“D-don’t! Let’s talk!” Tiger squeaked. For all his bluster, facing death unmoved wasn’t his style.

Releasing the chain, Guan Yu shoved Tiger aside and turned to Wang Fubin. The gang leader massaged his throat, abandoning retaliation—Guan Yu’s feral glare promised worse.

Let the rich brat get stabbed, Tiger thought bitterly. Serves him right for picking fights over nothing!

Patrons watched awestruck as Guan Yu wiped bloody hands, then pressed the knife to Wang’s nose. “Go on. Insult me again.”

Wang trembled, sweat and blood mingling on his chin.

“Ignoring you was mercy. Flaunt wealth again, and I’ll end you.” Guan Yu’s casual tone belied his glacial stare.

Tossing the knife aside, Guan Yu pulled out his wallet. “Check, please.”

“My treat!” Tiger hastily offered.

Guan Yu smirked. “I can afford water.” Nodding at stunned Du Xiaojuan, he added, “Leaving?”

“Y-yes! I’ll pay!” She scrambled ahead, wide-eyed.

As they exited, the crowd gaped in stunned silence.

In the taxi, Du bubbled with excitement. “You were amazing! Those gangsters froze!”

Guan Yu flexed his bleeding palm. “Got any tissues?”

“Oh!” Du gasped, pulling out纸巾. “Why grab the blade?!”

“I’ll manage,” Guan Yu said, but Du insistently cleaned his wound on her lap, drawing the driver’s chuckle.

“Young lady’s a keeper. Don’t take her to rough places.”

“We’re not dating!” Guan Yu protested as Du blushed crimson.

Pouting, Du tossed the纸巾 aside. Guan Yu wrapped his hand, hiding rapid healing.

“Free tomorrow?” Du suddenly asked after sulking.

“Why?”

“Grandpa’s birthday… help me pick a gift? At the flower market?”

Guan Yu blinked. “Flowers? I know nothing about—”

“Neither do I! Just come!”

Relenting, Guan Yu followed her, enduring envious stares from male students. Walking beside the campus belle, he finally understood why men flaunted beautiful companions—the jealous gazes were oddly satisfying.
