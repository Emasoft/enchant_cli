Madam Qin understood all too well that the household guards weren't at her personal disposal – particularly the several dozen elite warriors protecting Master Qin's person. Some were renowned martial artists specially invited to Qin Manor as personal bodyguards. Such men lay entirely beyond her authority to command.

Steward Ma shared this understanding. His gaze swept over the injured men before them, each with identically broken right arms. Though no martial artist himself, he recognized the precision required for such uniform injuries. This Wan Hong clearly operated on an entirely different level than ordinary guards.

"For absolute certainty, my lady," Steward Ma bowed, "allow me to handle this affair. I'll make... discreet arrangements."

Madam Qin's smile blossomed like a poisonous flower. This was precisely why she'd summoned the old retainer. "How splendid! I'll await your good news then." She turned to the guards with venomous sweetness: "You'll obey Steward Ma's orders. When you find that Wan Hong, beat him to death. I'll bear all consequences."

As the lady departed with her maid, Steward Ma shook his head wearily. Though vested with authority to command guards, he seldom exercised it. Yet a direct order from the mistress couldn't be refused.

"Wait outside the gate," he instructed the guards. "I'll make final preparations." His steps carried him towards Master Qin's personal guard contingent – elite warriors drawn from Jianghu's finest, their services secured through mountains of silver. These living fortresses accompanied the merchant lord everywhere, for great wealth breeds great enemies.

By dusk, Steward Ma had mobilized both regular guards and six of these elite fighters. The expedition's true purpose wasn't avenging Qu Hua's disgrace, but salvaging the Qin family's face. Even if Master Qin later objected, the justification stood clear.

Meanwhile at a bustling market street, Guan Yu found himself flanked by Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. The girls' insistence had dragged him from their inn, though his instincts prickled with unease. Vendors' cries filled the air as children darted through crowds, the atmosphere thick with roasted meats and imminent danger.

"Finally some excitement!" Qiqi twirled, cotton candy clutched in hand. "Much better than stuffy Demon Soul Sect!"

Wang Xiaorong nodded absently, her attention caught by approaching tumult. A phalanx of armed men materialized through the crowd, Steward Ma at their helm. The old retainer's deceptively mild features tightened as he pointed at Guan Yu.

"Young Master Wan Hong, I presume? The one who maimed our Qu Hua?"

Guan Yu's laugh held steel. "You bestow 'Young Master' on that animal? The title shames itself." His eyes swept over the hundred-strong force. "So Qin Manor sends its steward? Where's the master? Afraid to soil his hands?"

Steward Ma's veneer cracked. "Arrogance requires either capital or blindness. You possess neither." His hand slashed downward. "Subdue him!"

The attack came in waves – common guards first, then subtle killers hiding martial prowess. Guan Yu's Falling Soul Blade flashed, severing limbs with surgical precision. He moved like quicksilver through the throng, always keeping Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi in peripheral view.

When two elites broke off to target the girls, Wang Xiaorong's crossbow snapped up. Twin shots punched through skull and throat before the attackers closed half the distance.

"Qin Manor stoops to kidnapping women now?" Guan Yu's roar carried over clashing steel. Blood fountained as he bisected a swordsman. "Your master's shame outlives his corpse!"

Steward Ma watched his forces dwindle, cold realization dawning. This wasn't a suppression – it was harvest. Each fallen elite represented years of investment and connections severed. The old retainer's hand crept toward the emergency flare at his belt...
