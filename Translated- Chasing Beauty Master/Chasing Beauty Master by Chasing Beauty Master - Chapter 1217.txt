Then, Xuan Ming (Mysterious Enlightenment) waved his hand, and the Emperor's Seal floated before Guan Yu. Xuan Ming's heart bled with genuine anguish as he relinquished it. Guan Yu cradled the seal in his palms like a precious treasure.

Though now merely five centimeters in size, the Emperor's Seal outshone all other magical artifacts in radiance, as if deliberately flaunting its power. A warm current instantly flowed into Guan Yu's body, suffusing him with profound comfort. Lu stood nearby, wide-eyed yet restrained from action.

"Grandpa Xuan," Guan Yu asked eagerly, "what are the primary functions of this Emperor's Seal?"

"Let me explain," Lu interjected. "The origins of this seal remain obscure. It's said an ancient emperor possessed it during turbulent times. Obsessed with immortality, he dispatched envoys to seek esoteric methods. Eventually, an eccentric sage approached him, promising longevity in exchange for a tribute of beautiful women."

"Beauties were plentiful in the emperor's court. He readily agreed, ordering a hundred maidens delivered to the sage. Pleased, the sage produced this Emperor's Seal and taught the emperor arcane arts."

"Over time, the emperor mastered all the sage's techniques. Yet while engrossed in cultivation, he failed to notice the sage usurping his throne, harem, and kingdom. The sage exploited feminine yin energy to forge dark artifacts. When the emperor finally rebelled, he was grievously wounded and forced into exile."

"Years later, the deposed emperor returned, having cultivated rapidly through the seal's power. But the sage's sinister arts proved invincible, his followers transformed into deathless warriors. In fury, the emperor unleashed the seal's might, obliterating the entire palace. Unable to reclaim his throne, he destroyed it rather than let others possess it. Ultimately, he bartered his soul to the seal, unleashing cataclysmic energy that nearly annihilated the kingdom."

Guan Yu listened raptly. "How ruthless! He destroyed his own palace with family still inside—elders and children alike!"

Lu continued, "After the palace's destruction, the seal's energy corrupted vast lands. Both sage and artifact vanished thereafter."

"Such cruelty must have slaughtered countless innocents," Guan Yu remarked.

"All emperors are merciless," Xuan Ming sneered. "Weakness cannot hold thrones."

"But what truly makes this seal special? Can it trap souls?" Guan Yu pressed.

**Chapter 3125: The Emperor's Seal's Functions (Part 1)**

Lu clarified, "The seal doesn't trap souls. It possesses sentience—a near-immortal artifact with arrogant awareness that rejects unworthy masters. Xuan Ming readily gave it to you precisely because its pride demands an exceptional owner. As an ordinary mortal lacking spiritual energy or inner power, you'd normally be unfit."

Xuan Ming added, "Beyond sentience, its true value lies as an auxiliary artifact. None surpass its supportive capabilities. It stores four pre-loaded spells for instant activation—a mid-tier immortal artifact's power."

Guan Yu gradually understood. Most artifacts amplify spiritual energy for spellcasting. This seal instead stores complete spells, deployable without incantations or energy expenditure. Typically, cultivators bond one artifact to avoid conflicting energies, but the seal's unique design prevents such issues.

"After centuries," Xuan Ming sighed, "this remains the only auxiliary artifact I've encountered. Even sect leaders possess nothing comparable."

"What of the soul-bargaining legend?" Guan Yu asked warily.

Xuan Ming dismissed, "Old tales. The emperor willingly burned his soul for power through the seal's sentience. Without such sacrifice, only divine-level spells could achieve that destruction."

Lu interjected, "Perhaps we should reconsider gifting this dangerous artifact—"

"Nonsense!" Xuan Ming snapped. "Attempt bonding it, Guan Yu. If issues arise, discard it later. It won't hinder other artifacts."

Guan Yu nodded. Closing his eyes, he focused on the seal. Golden light streamed through his nostrils, transporting him to a shimmering void. Before him floated a luminous orb—the seal's consciousness.

"I've waited millennia, chosen one," boomed a voice.

"You're the seal's sentience?" Guan Yu asked.

"Indeed. Trapped here, I've rejected countless unworthy aspirants. Your aura intrigued me—a latent powerhouse."

Guan Yu masked his mortal status. "How do we bond?"

The sentience sighed dramatically. "Fate delivers a strong master... with vacant wit. Our pact is already sealed. Check your left palm."

A miniature seal mark glowed on Guan Yu's hand. "What of soul-devouring myths?"

"Lies!" it protested. "That emperor begged me to transmute his soul's combustion into energy. I nearly exhausted myself doing so. His choice, not my hunger."

Reassured, Guan Yu returned to reality. Xuan Ming rushed forward. "Success?"

"Yes. The sentience confirmed the truth." Guan Yu displayed his marked palm.

Xuan Ming lamented, "Decades I studied it, yet you bonded instantly. Artifacts choose whimsically."

Lu pressed, "Any dangers?"

"None," Guan Yu smiled. "The sentience explained everything."

Xuan Ming gestured expansively. "Now choose any artifact here. The seal proves your worthiness beyond doubt."
