Bill Lin ignored Guan Yu, surveying the scene before him. Yuan Shanding's subordinates were being forced to squat on the ground by Yu Gang members, not daring to move a muscle, while Yuan Shanding himself had been handcuffed to the stone lion at the entrance. Seeing this situation, Bill Lin heaved a deep sigh.

“Guan Yu, I don't understand. What exactly happened today? I sent people to deal with the monks here—there's some unresolved history between me and these monks. How does this concern you?” Bill Lin feigned ignorance.

“Is that so? Then I must apologize. These monks are my friends. When friends are in trouble, I must help. Today, you sent so many skilled fighters to attack my friends. Clearly, you hold me in contempt,” Guan Yu replied.

Bill Lin knew Guan Yu wasn't as easily fooled as others. “Guan Yu, I’ve already heeded Young Master Feng’s advice to leave you alone. Why do you keep opposing me? Why must you interfere in everything I do? I can’t help but wonder—is this deliberate?”

“Do you think I have nothing better to do than antagonize you? You flatter yourself. Enough talk. My friends suffered severe injuries today. Since these men were sent by you, let’s discuss how to resolve this. I wouldn’t mind handing them over to the police.”

Guan Yu’s tone carried a threat. If Yuan Shanding and his men were sent to the authorities, Yuan would undoubtedly expose Bill Lin during interrogation—a disaster for the latter.

Yuan Shanding’s group consisted of bandits with multiple murders to their names, some even lacking legal identities. If caught, they’d face dire consequences. Their downfall would drag Bill Lin down too, as hiring such killers carried heavy penalties.

Knowing the stakes, Bill Lin cut to the chase: “Let’s skip the formalities. How much to release them?”

Guan Yu stepped forward, smiling. “Straight to business, Young Master Bill. Money simplifies matters. These men of yours are skilled—I’m impressed you found so many capable pawns. Experts command higher prices, and my friends’ injuries are severe. Twenty million seems reasonable.”

“You go too far!” Bill Lin snapped. “Every time you extort me, it’s tens of millions! Do you think money grows on trees?”

Yuan Shanding’s eyes nearly bulged from their sockets at the sum. “Twenty million? Impossible! Bill Lin would never pay that much for us!” For Yuan’s group, this was an unimaginable fortune.

Guan Yu remained unmoved. “Young Master Bill, surely the illustrious Bill family wouldn’t balk at such a trifling amount?”

Bill Lin hesitated. The figure was carefully calculated—substantial yet manageable. Losing fifty skilled operatives would cripple his plans, but replacing them would prove harder than recouping the money.

“You’re ruthless,” Bill Lin finally said. “But these men were mere acquaintances introduced days ago. Twenty million is excessive.”

“Then leave,” Guan Yu coldly dismissed. “No one’s stopping you.”

Biting back anger, Bill Lin countered, “I’ll pay for my friend’s reputation, but twenty million is unreasonable.”

“If I were you,” Guan Yu pressed, “I’d pay without hesitation. Skilled men like these are worth far more. Your penny-pinching reveals why no one remains loyal.”

As tensions mounted, Zhijin Yu Lang emerged, locking eyes with Bill Lin’s subordinate Luo Bo. “Brother Luo Bo,” Zhijin smirked, “your recovery seems progressing well.”

“The wounds heal,” Luo Bo replied stiffly, “but not completely. You must relish seeing me like this.”

Zhijin’s warning hung sharp: “We serve different masters now. Provoke me, and I won’t hold back.”

Luo Bo wisely held his tongue. Observing his usually fearless subordinate cowed, Bill Lin paled when informed of Zhijin’s superior cultivation level—nearing Upper First-Class Adept status.

After tense negotiations, Bill Lin relented: “Twenty million it is. Release them.”

As Yuan Shanding’s group knelt in gratitude, Bill Lin basked in their apparent loyalty, unaware their bow symbolized apology, not allegiance. Once freed, Yuan intended to disappear—bound by deeper loyalties than money could buy.

When Bill Lin tossed the check contemptuously, Guan Yu let the disrespect slide. “Our dear Young Master will rage when he realizes he paid twenty million for useless pawns,” he remarked after Bill Lin’s departure.

Zhijin demanded half the ransom, but Guan Yu redirected funds to the injured. “Extract more from Yingzi later,” he bargained, knowing the fiery woman controlled Bridge District’s finances.

As the group dispersed, Guan Yu chuckled at the unfolding irony—a costly lesson in misplaced loyalty, paid in cold hard cash.
