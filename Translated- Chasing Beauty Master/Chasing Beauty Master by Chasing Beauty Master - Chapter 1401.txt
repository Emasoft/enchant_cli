Chapter 3634: Heeding Opinions

Guan Yu could only sigh helplessly at Wang Xiaorong's words. After leaving the room, he went directly to the third floor and entered a spacious chamber.

Though large, the room felt starkly empty. The vast hall contained only a circular wooden table near the window, adorned with a tea set. A middle-aged man in his forties sat there savoring tea with practiced elegance. Beside the tea set lay a chessboard, and to Guan Yu's surprise from afar – it was Chinese chess. Who would have thought such people here enjoyed this?

The Demon Lord sat sipping tea and moving chess pieces, seemingly engrossed in his solitary game. Observing him, Guan Yu noted the man's imposing stature – taller than himself, with a square-jawed face exuding stern resolve. His ink-black hair was tied back with a bronze hairpin, twin locks of hair framing his temples. Though expressionless, the Demon Lord nodded slightly after each sip, as if approving his own tea artistry.

Wang Xiaorong tugged Guan Yu forward cheerfully. “Father, I’ve brought Guan Yu.”

The Demon Lord finally turned, locking eyes with the younger man. As the junior, Guan Yu bowed slightly. “Greetings, Demon Lord. I heard you’ve long wished to meet me. After Wang Xiaorong’s persistent urging, I decided to accept.”

“Oh? Were you so reluctant?” The Demon Lord rose, radiating authority.

“Truthfully, yes.” Guan Yu met his gaze unflinchingly. “Your reputation in the martial world precedes you. Moreover, having obtained the first part of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique from Elder Menghua’s crypt – something I know you covet – I feared this meeting might endanger me.”

He glanced at Wang Xiaorong. “But given my... close relationship with Xiaorong, I must occasionally heed her counsel.”

“At least you’ve some sense,” the Demon Lord grunted, waving them to sit. “Come, boy. Let’s talk over chess.”

Wang Xiaorong blinked in surprise. Her father had yielded faster than expected despite Guan Yu’s bluntness.

As they settled at the board, the Demon Lord asked, “Do you play?”

“Passably,” Guan Yu replied modestly.

“Good. We’ll converse through the game.”

Wang Xiaorong warned, “Be careful, Guan Yu! Father spends days playing with Left Envoy at the Soul Demon Sect. Sometimes their matches last weeks!”

“We’ll see,” Guan Yu said, arranging red pieces. “But first – red moves first, then green. Knights move diagonally, elephants traverse squares, cannons strike over mountains, pawns never retreat, and generals stay veiled. Same rules?”

The Demon Lord nodded. “Similar, though I’ve not heard that ‘red first’ saying.”

“Father!” Wang Xiaorong pouted. “You’re being unfair! Let Guan Yu have first move!”

“Very well. Begin.”

Guan Yu opened with a central cannon – a bold gambit. The Demon Lord responded by advancing an elephant, eyes never leaving the board. “You should know,” he remarked, “I nearly had you killed for that technique.”

“But Xiaorong stayed your hand. My thanks for that mercy.”

The Demon Lord sighed. “What use is conquering realms if I cannot please my only daughter? Her happiness comes first.”

Guan Yu arched a brow, reassessing this reputedly ruthless figure. “I admire that sentiment. With such a daughter, you’ve every reason to rejoice.”

Wang Xiaorong beamed, pearly teeth gleaming as she struggled to contain her smile.

The match intensified quickly. Guan Yu developed his chariots early – the most powerful attackers. The Demon Lord adopted an unorthodox strategy, advancing all five front pawns to claim territory.

“Father!” Wang Xiaorong protested as the board became congested. “Are you bullying him?”

“Silence, girl. This is strategy.”

By the fifteenth move, Guan Yu’s chariots and cannons penetrated enemy lines, pinning the Demon Lord’s knight and chariot. Forced to retreat a knight to protect a pawn, the Demon Lord changed tack. “You’re from another realm, aren’t you?”

Guan Yu shot Wang Xiaorong a glance.

“I never told anyone!” she cried. “Not even Father!”

“True,” the Demon Lord confirmed. “My spies are thorough.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Correct. I stumbled here through a dimensional passage.”

Wang Xiaorong gasped. “You never said it was another world!”

“I only recently understood it myself,” Guan Yu admitted, maneuvering his chariot. “But why does it matter?”

The Demon Lord’s knight leaped forward, threatening Guan Yu’s position. “Because knowledge is power. Your... unique perspective interests me.”

As pieces clashed, the Demon Lord mused, “Life mirrors chess. Overconfidence breeds downfall.”

“Yet passivity guarantees defeat,” Guan Yu countered, sliding his chariot to trap the Demon Lord’s cannon. “One wrong step leads to more – but recovery requires boldness.”

The Demon Lord chuckled darkly as his cannon fell. “Well played. Yet the game is long.”

Chapter 3635: I Don’t Believe

“You think trapping my cannon wins you advantage?” The Demon Lord’s retreating knight suddenly threatened Guan Yu’s flank. “True power lies in patience.”

Wang Xiaorong bit her lip, sensing the tide turning. Guan Yu’s chariot dodged the knight’s path. “Patience without action is stagnation. Your cannon dies regardless.”

“A small loss.” The Demon Lord sacrificed the piece, then lunged at Guan Yu’s remaining elephant. “But your defenses crumble.”

Guan Yu smirked, chariot sweeping toward the Demon Lord’s elephant. “Sacrifices go both ways.”

“Fool!” The Demon Lord’s second elephant countered the strike. “Did you forget paired elephants protect each other?”

“Did you forget my bishop?” Guan Yu’s hidden cannon fired across the board, obliterating the defending elephant.

Wang Xiaorong clapped gleefully as the Demon Lord scowled. “Cheap tricks!”

“Valid tactics,” Guan Yu corrected. “You taught me – life mirrors chess.”

The Demon Lord slammed a pawn forward. “Enough games. Why ally with my daughter?”

“Must motives always be complex?” Guan Yu advanced his knight. “Perhaps I simply...”

“Don’t!” Wang Xiaorong interrupted, blushing. “Just play!”

The Demon Lord studied them, then gruffly muttered, “Hmph. Your knight overextends.”

Chapter 3636: One Wrong Step Leads to More

As night deepened, the match reached its climax. Guan Yu’s early aggression left him overextended, while the Demon Lord’s patient pawn advance now constricted the board.

“Your flashy opening falters,” the Demon Lord gloated, a pawn promoting to cannon. “Substance outlasts style.”

Guan Yu wiped sweat, realizing his trapped chariot. “Yet without risk, there’s no reward.” He sacrificed the chariot to breach the Demon Lord’s defenses.

“Rash!” The Demon Lord’s general retreated. “You’ve no pieces left!”

“Wrong.” Guan Yu’s lone knight leaped – a checkmate threat.

The Demon Lord froze. Every escape path led to defeat. After long silence, he tipped his king. “Well... played.”

Wang Xiaorong exploded in cheers. Guan Yu exhaled shakily. “You let me win.”

“Never.” The Demon Lord’s stern mask cracked into a smile. “But perhaps... you’re worthy of her.”

As Wang Xiaorong embraced them both, Guan Yu finally understood – this chess match had never been about the game.
