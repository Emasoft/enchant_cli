But unexpectedly, Guan Yu and his group had brought people in, disrupting his plans. Now he had no choice but to help Guan Yu's team rescue their companion.

If it had been Guan Yu alone, Senior Brother Qi would never have let him go. Handing Guan Yu over to the Blood Lord would have earned him immense glory, potentially elevating his status in Blackblood Ridge above even Black Panther and Black Wolf.

However, with Xiao Zhi and A'Ze present alongside Siqi, Senior Brother Qi couldn't betray Guan Yu without absolute confidence in eliminating them all. Rescuing the hostage took priority now. By aiding Guan Yu's mission, he could at least return to his sect with some merit.

Senior Brother Qi desperately wished to be a normal disciple wholeheartedly serving the Yunqing Sect. But circumstances forbade it—he'd been forcibly fed the Blood Lord's lethal poison. Without monthly antidotes, he'd transform into a black-furred bat until death.

When Xuanming originally sent Senior Brother Qi down the mountain, he'd first come here. For years he'd secretly transmitted intelligence to the sect. The reports about the Demonic Cult gathering forces at Qujiang City all came through him. Yet to gain the Blood Lord's trust here, he'd been forced to take that fatal poison, becoming what he was now.

Even Senior Brother Qi himself no longer knew which side to serve. Though he longed to return to secluded cultivation at Yunqing Sect, that path was closed. He was no longer the headmaster's beloved disciple, but a key operative of the Demonic Cult's Blackblood Ridge.

Killing for the Blood Lord, conducting missions, plundering—if his sect learned of these deeds, they'd never forgive him. Worse, without monthly antidotes, he'd become a murderous black-furred bat demon. Neither side would tolerate his existence.

"New here? Daring to cheat at gambling—you've got a death wish!" A voice shouted from the innermost mahjong tables.

Snapped from his thoughts, Senior Brother Qi looked up to see an enraged gambler clutching Xiao Zhi's collar. "Big brother, I was just joking! No need for this!" Xiao Zhi pleaded fearfully.

"You lose, you pay! Think this is child's play?" The man lifted Xiao Zhi's head, revealing his identity. Senior Brother Qi immediately intervened: "These new subordinates are mine. Have they offended you?"

"Oh? If it isn't Brother Qi." The man sneered. "He lost and refuses to pay. You know our rules—no debts allowed."

"Consider Wolf Brother's face. I'll cover his debt." Senior Brother Qi maintained his stern expression. As Wolf Brother's subordinate, the man eventually relented: "For Brother Qi's sake, I'll grant him extension."

Xiao Zhi sighed in relief, impressed by Senior Brother Qi's influence. Secretly pleased at avoiding payment, Senior Brother Qi coldly ordered: "No money? Stay out of gambling dens. Follow me."

Trailing excitedly behind, Xiao Zhi and A'Ze recognized their senior—champion of the Liu Feng Grand Assembly a century prior, sent on missions years ago and never seen again... until now.

In a secluded area, Senior Brother Qi admonished: "This is too reckless! If something happened, how would I explain to the headmaster?"

"Senior Brother, you've risen high here!" Xiao Zhi marveled. A'Ze added: "Of course! Our senior excels everywhere. The headmaster sent him to investigate the Demonic Cult—clearly he's succeeded."

Though basking in their admiration, Senior Brother Qi remained vigilant: "Lower your voices! Guan Yu's team awaits. We'll regroup at the wine cellar."

At the cellar, Second-to-Wolf guzzled alcohol defiantly as Senior Brother Qi entered. Focused on rescuing Xiaotong, the senior ignored the provocation—maintaining dignity before juniors mattered most.

"Now that we're assembled, what's the plan?" Guan Yu asked.

Senior Brother Qi sighed. "You came too abruptly. Xiaotong's guarded day and night in the Blood Lord's lair. Our only option is a direct assault."

Second-to-Wolf slammed his gourd. "I say we charge in! With our numbers—"

"Foolish drunkard!" Senior Brother Qi cut him off. "The Blood Lord isn't stupid. He'll take Xiaotong hostage while reinforcements surround us. Think before speaking!"

As Xiao Zhi anxiously pressed for action, Senior Brother Qi seized the moment to publicly shame the duo: "You two! Gambling when lives are at stake! Had I not intervened—"

Guan Yu grew irritated by this petty grandstanding. Wang Xiaorong observed Senior Brother Qi's showboating with disdain—such self-aggrandizement revealed poor character.

"Enough reprimands," Wang interjected. "I have a plan. Senior Brother Qi, trusted by the Blood Lord, will lead a rescue team. Meanwhile, others create diversion by setting fire to the wine stores. Flames will draw guards away from the lair."

Though Guan Yu approved, Senior Brother Qi objected: "The Blood Lord would suspect me immediately!" His cowardice obvious, he added: "I'll handle the arson team."

Disgusted by his evasiveness, Guan Yu finalized plans: "Second-to-Wolf, Siqi and I will confront the Blood Lord. Xiaorong joins the rescue. Senior Brother Qi leads the distraction team."

As they moved out, the scene shifted to the Blood Lord's chamber where the demonic leader berated a subordinate: "Useless worm! Burn the intruders!"

Spotting Wang Xiaorong removing her hood, the Blood Lord froze. "You! Wang Xiaorong! Daring to invade my domain!"

"Would I come unprepared?" Wang retorted, revealing her identity as the Demonic Sect Leader's daughter. "Harm me, and my father—"

"Your father's not here!" The Blood Lord transformed into a black-furred monstrosity, swinging his warhammer. "Today you feed my hounds!"

As Guan Yu and Second-to-Wolf engaged the beast, Wang and Siqi worked to free Xiaotong from her chains. "I knew you'd come!" Xiaotong whispered weakly.

"Save strength," Siqi urged, channeling spiritual energy into the locks.

The battle raged—the transformed Blood Lord proving formidable. Second-to-Wolf realized with alarm that this demon's power rivaled his own. Yet through coordinated attacks, they pressed forward, the fate of all hanging in the balance...
