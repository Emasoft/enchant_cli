Huang Zhongxing was also startled. Right in front of the car's hood, Guan Yu leaned casually against the guardrail, waving relaxedly at them through the windshield.

“B-boss! H-he...he just appeared out of nowhere!”

Haozi remained petrified, utterly shaken by Guan Yu’s inexplicable arrival. After obtaining Li Xi’s location from Jiang Ziqi, Guan Yu had activated his gravity system and raced here at blinding speed before leaping directly in front of Huang Zhongxing’s vehicle. Haozi nearly mistook him for a ghost.

In truth, had Guan Yu not deliberately masked his presence, many would’ve sworn they’d seen an apparition!

“Out of nowhere?” Huang Zhongxing scoffed. “Are you fucking blind? He’s human, not a ghost! How could he just ‘appear’?”

“But I really saw—”

“Enough bullshit! Floor the gas! Ram him! Crush him to paste!”

Seeing Guan Yu standing unflinching before the car, Huang Zhongxing’s fury erupted. *Think I won’t run you over? I’ll grind your bones to pulp!*

“Hit him! Kill him!”

Haozi slammed the accelerator to the floor. The engine’s roar crescendoed as Li Xi screamed through the window, “Guan Yu! Run! They’re going to kill you!”

“Shut up!” Huang Zhongxing backhanded her viciously. “Faster! Now!”

Releasing the brake, the Jeep lunged forward like a beast, hurtling toward Guan Yu.

Even a light tap from such a massive off-road vehicle could cripple a man. With Haozi’s full-throttle assault, any ordinary person would’ve been crushed instantly.

But Guan Yu was no ordinary man. His superhuman abilities allowed him to evade effortlessly—no hesitation needed.

Yet he stood firm. As the Jeep barreled closer, a cold smirk curled his lips. “You dared lay hands on my woman? That arm of yours belongs to the dogs now!”

**Chapter 967: The Shock**

Only when the Jeep nearly grazed him did Guan Yu leisurely activate his gravity system. He raised a hand, as if to casually push the vehicle aside.

Haozi and Huang Zhongxing sneered. “You think you’re a machine? Blocking a car with your hand? Delusional!”

Blindfolded, Li Xi heard Huang Zhongxing’s taunt and panicked, her heart clawing up her throat. *Why isn’t he moving? If he dies...what’ll happen to me?* Unconsciously, her hidden feelings spilled into the open.

“Hah! Time to die, Guan Yu!”

Huang Zhongxing’s face twisted with glee as the Jeep closed in. Imagining the glory of delivering this victory to the Magnate Society, his body quivered with excitement.

But reality defied his expectations. The moment the Jeep touched Guan Yu’s outstretched palm, it collided with an immovable force. Metal shrieked as tires spun wildly, spewing sparks across the asphalt—yet the vehicle froze mid-charge.

Huang Zhongxing and Haozi gaped in horror.

“A ghost! He’s not human—a ghost!”

Haozi, foot jammed on the gas, trembled uncontrollably. His bulging eyes threatened to pop from their sockets. Huang Zhongxing slumped pale against his seat, muttering, “This isn’t real...can’t be real...”

No human, regardless of strength, could halt a speeding vehicle. Yet Guan Yu had—defying all logic!

Unconcerned by their shock, Guan Yu disabled the engine via his scanning system and strolled toward them.

---

True to his name “Mouse,” Haozi let out a shrill “Ghost!” as Guan Yu approached, then slumped lifeless—scared to death.

Huang Zhongxing fared little better. Trembling and glassy-eyed, the stench of urine filled the car. He’d pissed himself in terror.

Disgusted, Guan Yu ignored him and carried Li Xi from the backseat.

Tearing off her blindfold, Li Xi threw herself into his arms, tears streaming. “Are you hurt? Are you okay?”

*Well, this is a silver lining!* Guan Yu grinned inwardly. *Li Xi, still pretending you don’t care? Your act’s crumbling!* Relishing her soft warmth, his thoughts wandered.

Nearby, Lin Lin—rescued by Lin Dong—clasped her hands to her chest, starry-eyed. “So romantic! So heroic!”

Lin Dong studied Guan Yu warily. *What did he do to terrify Huang Zhongxing so? And that driver...died of pure fright. How?*

Hearing Lin Lin’s sigh, Li Xi snapped back to reality. Blushing under Guan Yu’s teasing gaze, she bit his shoulder hard and shoved him away.

“Damn! You bite like a dog!” Guan Yu rubbed the deep teeth marks—she hadn’t held back.

Smoothing her disheveled hair, Li Xi regained her icy composure, glaring silently.

Undeterred, Guan Yu slung an arm around her. “Xixi, I know you’re shy, but don’t worry—I won’t tell anyone you’re in love with me!”

*Xixi?* Lin Dong’s stoic face twitched with nausea.

Li Xi shot Guan Yu a frosty look. “Must you be so narcissistic?”

“It’s confidence! Admit it—you were terrified for me earlier. That’s love!” His hand wandered along her shoulder.

“Let go!” She resisted stomping his foot, gritting, “Release me or I’ll bite again!”

“You wouldn’t dare, Xixi.”

*Crunch!* Guan Yu howled as her heel smashed his toes.

“Lin Lin, let’s go.”

Without a backward glance, Li Xi strode away. Lin Lin offered a sympathetic shrug before following.

“What about them?” Lin Dong gestured at Huang Zhongxing and the other thugs.

Guan Yu’s playful demeanor vanished, replaced by icy severity. “Give them to Jiang Ziqi. Let him deliver this ‘gift’ to the Magnate Society.”

---

Meanwhile, Li Yu grew uneasy. Huang Zhongxing should’ve reported back by now. Calling his number yielded only a dead line.

“Dammit!” He slammed his desk. Something had gone wrong.

A lackey burst in, panicked. “Boss! Trouble—Boss Chang is dead!”

“What?!” Li Yu paled.

At the villa, Chang Qing’s corpse lay undisturbed. Examining the fatal neck wound, Li Yu concluded: a professional kill, no struggle. Within Magnate territory, under their watch—only one enemy possessed such skill.

“Guan Yu!”

Though the Magnates had many rivals, only Guan Yu dared confront them head-on now. “Find him! Track his—”

His phone rang. Seeing the caller ID, Li Yu stiffened.

“Young Master Jiang.”

Jiang Ziqi’s voice held equal frustration. Despite surveilling Huang Zhongxing, the feed had static before Guan Yu’s arrival—clearly Guan Yu’s doing.

Arriving at the scene per Guan Yu’s call, he’d found only a catatonic Huang Zhongxing, Haozi’s corpse, and maimed Magnate henchmen.

**Chapter 968: The Cohabitation Question**

Jiang Ziqi longed to gauge Guan Yu’s true power, but this spectacle only deepened his dread.

Haozi’s death—asphyxiation from adrenal shock. The Jeep showed no collision damage. Guan Yu had halted it through sheer force.

Whatever method he’d used, Jiang Ziqi felt utterly outmatched. For the first time, helplessness gripped him.

“You know why I’m calling,” Jiang Ziqi stated.

Li Yu, viewing Jiang Ziqi as Guan Yu’s mouthpiece, understood Huang Zhongxing had failed. His fists clenched, murder in his eyes.

“What does Guan Yu want?”

“He’s returning your trash. Handle them.”

The message was clear: Satisfy Guan Yu through Jiang Ziqi, or face consequences. Jiang Ziqi knew his role—mediator or scapegoat.

“Dispose of them. Just tell me Guan Yu’s terms!”

“Disband the Magnates. Leave the capital. My advice.”

“Impossible!” Li Yu barked. The Magnates were generations’ labor—he wouldn’t destroy it. “If Guan Yu wants war, we’ll fight!”

“Fool. This isn’t between you and Guan Yu anymore. It’s between you and me. Or rather, the Jiang Family and you.”

“The Jiangs?” Li Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Using your family against us?”

If true, the Magnates were doomed.

“Advising you: Refuse, and you’ll regret it. Without Jiang support, Guan Yu can still crush you effortlessly.”

*Click.* The line died.

“Bastard!” Li Yu hurled his phone. Jiang Ziqi’s final words haunted him. *Was Guan Yu toying with us all along?*

But Jiang Ziqi never bluffed...

Sighing agedly, Li Yu ordered, “Convene the council.”

“Wait!” A young man in colonel’s uniform entered.

Recognizing him, Li Yu brightened.

Back at the villa, tension lingered between Guan Yu and Li Xi. She retreated upstairs without a word.

Slumping on the sofa, Guan Yu grumbled as Lin Dong remarked dryly, “Real men cry.”

“Cry my ass! I’ll win her over!”

“Next steps?”

“Take my stubborn bride-to-be to Taiwan.” Guan Yu shrugged. Liu Wanqian’s rebellion seemed trivial compared to Li Xi’s defiance.

“And the Magnates?”

“Jiang Ziqi’ll handle them.”

“Using him as your blade? You’ve grown cunning.”

Indeed, Guan Yu’s scheme pitted Jiang Ziqi against the Magnates. Regardless of outcome, Guan Yu profited—a masterstroke of manipulation.

“Try me!” Guan Yu challenged.

“No hands.”

Thus ensued a one-sided kicking match.

Upstairs, Lin Lin badgered Li Xi: “So you *do* like him! When’s the wedding? Babies when?”

“We’re not even dating!”

“You’re living together! Basically married!”

Li Xi flushed crimson. “He’s a tenant! Roommates!”

“Sure, ‘roommates.’ When’s the upgrade to lovers?”

“Never!”

“Bet he’s fantasized about you. And you about him!”

Li Xi retorted, “What about you? Think he’s immune to your...assets?”

Their figures mirrored each other—slim, leggy, curvaceous—though Lin Lin’s bust edged slightly fuller.
