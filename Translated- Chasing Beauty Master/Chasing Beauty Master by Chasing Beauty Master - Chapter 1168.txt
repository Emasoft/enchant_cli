Just as he was about to depart, another treasure map fragment surfaced. If this fragment's position proved favorable when combined with the three he already possessed, they might finally discern the approximate location of the hidden treasure.

Poison Widow voiced similar thoughts: "Who knows what section this new fragment shows? If it's from the central area, we might finally pinpoint the exact burial site."

Young Master Feng, ever the contrarian, scoffed, "Impossible! The crucial central fragments never appear prematurely. Suppose there are twelve fragments total – if key sections surfaced too early, what purpose would the remaining pieces serve? The full picture can't emerge until every last fragment is assembled."

His reasoning proved sound. When Guan Yu had originally designed these maps, he'd intentionally rendered each fragment's markings ambiguous. Only through complete assembly could the true location be deciphered – thus ensuring every scrap maintained its value.

Guan Yu had instructed Elder Xie to deliver the fragments to the Yang Family's auction house for safety. Constant surveillance and assassination attempts had become untenable, even with Elder Xie's formidable cultivation to protect him. Yet the eccentric old man refused compliance, relishing the prospect of "stretching his limbs" through combat after years of seclusion.

Uncertain of Elder Xie's true capabilities, Guan Yu reluctantly acquiesced. His greatest fear remained Luo Bo – that peerless expert could overwhelm even Elder Xie's mastery of unorthodox techniques.

Though irritated by Feng's earlier remarks, Bill Lin grudgingly acknowledged their validity. "In all our confrontations," he mused aloud, "Guan Yu's never shown interest in collecting these fragments. Why?"

"Perhaps he finds the endeavor tedious," Poison Widow suggested. "Or doubts the treasure's existence entirely."

"Yet he bid fiercely against me at Yang's auction," Bill countered. "Only withdrawing when prices soared beyond reason."

"Then his current indifference stems from calculation," she deduced. "He knows your collected fragments are irreplaceable. Without them, any fragments he acquires remain useless. Why waste effort on incomplete puzzles?"

Enlightenment dawned on Bill. "Exactly! Since he can't obtain my pieces, pursuing others becomes futile. This explains his sudden apathy." Straightening in his chair, he declared, "Then the path clears! With Guan Yu out of contention, these fragments shall be mine!"

Luo Bo interjected, "But Master, our flight departs tonight—"

"Cancel it!" Bill waved dismissively. "The treasure's promise outweighs past losses. Full acquisition could recoup everything!"

As Luo Bo exited to handle arrangements, Poison Widow recounted Elder Xie's theatrical debut: the unkempt elder's commotion at Night Blossom Club – stomped toes, public shoe removal that nauseated the Yang heiress, extorting compensation before trading his "family heirloom shoe pad" for cash.

"A madman using treasure maps as insoles?" Bill laughed incredulously. "Either an imbecile or brilliantly unorthodox. Find him before others recognize that scrap's value!"

Elder Xie proved remarkably visible – reeking of decay yet frequenting luxury establishments. His stench-laden appearances at upscale hotels, nightclubs, and spas became tabloid fodder. Bill's operatives required no detective work; media coverage tracked the odorous trail.

At Golden Peace Hotel's opulent private dining room, Bill's entourage faced the olfactory assault of their target. Between ravenous mouthfuls of thirty-course banquet, Elder Xie resembled a starved ghoul – gnawing fallen bones from the carpet, grease-smeared face glistening under chandeliers.

Poison Widow studied him warily, ancient memories stirring. Could this wretch be one of the legendary Ten Fiends? But those terrors hadn't been seen for decades...

Patient through the grotesque spectacle, Bill finally addressed the belching elder: "Why auction through Yang's leeches? Sell directly to me – higher profits for both."

Wiping hands on stained robes, Elder Xie feigned reluctance: "This ancestral relic... only poverty forces my hand." His eyes gleamed with cunning. "But rumors say it's valuable. What's your offer?"

"First authentication," Poison Widow interjected smoothly. "Then negotiation."

Chomping a drumstick, the elder mumbled, "What's one scrap matter? You need all twelve!"

Bill's smile tightened. This "madman" understood the game perfectly.
