“Ahem, old uncle, rest assured and use them. I have plenty—see for yourself!”

After speaking, Guan Yu reached into his pouch again and pulled out dozens of other pills. The old man glanced over them and gasped in astonishment—several were Earth-grade elixirs! “In my decades of life, I’ve never seen so many Earth-grade elixirs at once! Young man, where did you acquire these?”

“That… I can’t explain right now,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. “But first, take these pills to ease your pain!” He couldn’t very well admit he’d stolen them.

“Very well. Since you insist, I’ll humbly accept,” Liu Yishou said, swallowing the pills.

True to their Earth-grade potency, the effects were extraordinary. Soon after ingestion, warmth surged through the old man’s body, and his wounds began closing visibly!

Liu Chuntian gasped in disbelief. “Grandpa! Look—your injuries are healing!”

Though surprised, Guan Yu knew this was superficial. Venom still lurked within Liu Yishou’s veins. The thought of poison reminded him of Ami. “Old uncle,” he pressed, “did that monster use magic or swordsmanship?”

“A mix… but leaning toward magic.”

“Magic! It must be him!” Guan Yu growled.

“Young Master Guan Yu, have you found a clue?” Liu Yishou asked.

Guan Yu hesitated. Though harmless, these strangers didn’t need his full story. Burdened already, he couldn’t risk new complications. His mind turned to Ami—even with Bikamao guarding her, that unreliable cat left him uneasy.

“Oh, nothing. Just recalling a similar case. If you fear staying here, join me at the inn. We can watch each other’s backs.”

Liu Yishou nearly refused until Chuntian interjected, “Grandpa, Master Guan Yu’s right! If that monster returns, we’re defenseless!”

“But we barely know him…”

Though unspoken, Guan Yu understood the distrust. He sighed. “Since you doubt me, let me ask—what cultivation level do you perceive me at?”

Liu Yishou scrutinized him, then closed his eyes. Upon reopening them, shock filled his gaze. “Impossible! How can someone so young reach such heights?”

Chuntian tugged his sleeve. “Grandpa, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing… just marveling at meeting a prodigy. With Master Guan Yu’s power, even that monster would struggle!”

Chuntian’s heart fluttered. *Handsome and formidable… I wonder if he’s taken?*

Unaware of her thoughts, Guan Yu watched the bickering pair. *How can they laugh so carefree after nearly dying?*

At the inn, relief washed over him seeing Ami and Bikamao safe. The cat smirked. “Boss, were you hunting monsters… or beauties?”

Guan Yu glared. “Later, furball.”

Ami sprang from bed, leaping into his arms. “Dragonkin Brother! I was so worried!”

“Wow! Did you bring this sister to keep me company?” Ami chirped.

“Ah, yes. How are you feeling?”

“My poison’s gone! Why ask?”

Guan Yu coughed. “Just checking your rest. I didn’t sleep either.”

“Elves don’t need much sleep!”

Chuntian watched them, a pang in her chest. *They must be siblings… right?*

Liu Yishou approached Guan Yu. “Forgive my question—she calls you ‘Dragonkin,’ yet you seem human.”

“You’ve met dragonfolk?”

The old man’s silence confirmed it. “I’ll explain another time. Now, does Ami share your venom?”

“Unclear. I’ll compare samples later.”

“But you said she’s cured?”

Guan Yu lowered his voice. “Does she look cured?”

After scrutiny, Liu Yishou shook his head.

“Then rest. At dawn, take me to the graveyard. Let’s meet this monster.”

“But it attacked in daylight before!”

“Good. Saves me the hunt.”

Liu Yishou marveled at the youth’s audacity. *Arrogant… but perhaps justified.*

At cockcrow, Guan Yu awoke to find the girls already chatting downstairs.

“Dragonkin Lazybones! The sun’s up!” Ami teased.

Breakfast proved challenging—strange local dishes tested Guan Yu’s palate. Chuntian giggled at their grimaces.

“Meow!” Bikamao’s entrance diverted the girls, who rushed to pet him.

Guan Yu sighed. *Two chatterboxes already…*
