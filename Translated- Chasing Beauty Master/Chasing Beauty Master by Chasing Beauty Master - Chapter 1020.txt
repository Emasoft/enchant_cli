The little sprite Qu Shuangshuang stared unblinkingly at Yin Zhong with her large, sparkling eyes, making the young man visibly uncomfortable. Yin Zhong had only experienced one romantic relationship in his life – his first and only.

During university, Yin Zhong had dated a classmate. Though deeply devoted, he found himself constantly catering to his volatile girlfriend. Friends warned him not to "hang himself on a single tree," witnessing how she treated him like a servant. Yet love blinded him until that fateful sophomore gathering.

Drunk and emboldened, his girlfriend embraced another male student before Yin Zhong's eyes, sneering "You're just an idiot!" The cruel words from his beloved shattered him. How could the woman he'd cherished for eighteen months view him as a fool?

Heartbroken, Yin Zhong abandoned his studies to apprentice at his father's auto repair shop. Over the years, classmates and parents tried arranging matches, but he refused all introductions. Only when time softened old wounds did he agree to meet Meimei through Xiao Yang's mediation – a virtuous country girl praised for filial piety and simple honesty.

At the arranged meeting, Meimei kept her eyes demurely lowered after their initial handshake, while Shuangshuang examined Yin Zhong with unnerving intensity. "Shuangshuang!" Xue Jing chided as waiters served their order. "This match is for your sister! Don't go fancying him yourself!"

"Of course not!" The younger sister protested, cheeks flushing. "I'm just checking if he's bad! Can't let sister marry a scoundrel!"

Laughter filled the air. "These sisters!" Xiao Yang marveled. "Who'd guess such beauties came from the countryside?"

"Rural roses like these are rare," Xue Jing affirmed. "Proper girls from decent families, unlike those city hussies."

Guanyu privately thought Meimei fortunate if Yin Zhong approved. Observing the bashful pair, Xue Jing teased: "Why so shy? Are we the ones courting?"

Shuangshuang tugged Meimei's sleeve. "He's no match for Brother Guanyu, but not bad! Doesn't seem wicked."

Guanyu cleared his throat. "Why compare me? I'm not here to marry!" The unintended slight stung – two men present, yet immediately deemed inferior.

Yin Zhong smiled ruefully. "Who in City A doesn't know Guanyu's reputation? Of course I pale in comparison."

"Nonsense!" Guanyu waved this aside. "We're all equals here. Let's speak plainly."

Xiao Yang nudged Yin Zhong. "You're the suitor! Be proactive! Grown man shyer than the maiden!"

**Chapter 2608: My Fears**

"Apologies." Yin Zhong rubbed his nose. "First blind date. Nervous."

Conversation flowed for two hours over dinner, carefully avoiding the crucial question. As they parted, Xue Jing made them exchange contacts to develop friendship first.

Later at the hospital, Xue Jing pressed Meimei: "Well? Suitable?"

"He's... nice." The country girl worried. "But city folk with family business... why want a village girl?"

Xue Jing phoned Yin Zhong immediately. "Meimei likes you. Will you court her?"

"Beautiful, my type," came the reply. "Temperament seems compatible. Let's try."

When told, Meimei's shy smile betrayed her joy. Shuangshuang chimed in: "Big brother's decent!" before recounting events to her bedridden mother.

As Guanyu tried departing, Shuangshuang pouted: "You promised to show me the city! Breaking your word?" Trapped by her puppy-dog eyes, he surrendered.

**Chapter 2609: Dreaming Of**

Meanwhile, Feng Manor buzzed with conspirators – Ge Yinglai from Century Garden Academy, Sun Xu, Fang Su, all united against Guanyu.

Young Master Feng watched uneasily as Bill Lynn rallied forces. His mended arm twinged at memories of past defeats. "Opposing Guanyu brings ruin!" he warned. "Abandon this madness!"

But Bill Lynn, still seething from temple humiliations and coveting Xue Jing, would hear none of it. "Gather every enemy he's made! We'll crush him through numbers!"

The Feng heir shuddered, recalling how Guanyu nearly destroyed their family. Only Bill family intervention saved them. Now this foreigner's obsession threatened to rekindle disaster.

In the packed hall, Bill Lynn declared: "Tonight we feast, then plan Guanyu's downfall! Any dissenters, leave now!"

None moved. Feng tried sneaking away, but Bill Lynn dragged him back. "Coward! Eliminate him first, and no revenge follows!"

"Easier said than done!" Feng retorted. "Countless have tried! Even your four elite guards failed in Japan!"

The air thickened with tension as old enemies and new allies plotted. Somewhere in the city, unaware of the gathering storm, Guanyu drove through neon-lit streets with a chattering country girl rediscovering wonder through her smartphone's lens.
