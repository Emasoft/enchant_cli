“The Chen family turned down such a great opportunity?” Guan Yu asked curiously. “Why would they reject such a lucrative prospect? Are they fools? Can noodles made by fools even taste good?”

Lin Qiaoqiao explained, “The Chens are local farmers from Huzhou Town who rose to fame through their Yangchun noodles. They insist on selling their noodles exclusively within Huzhou Town. Anyone craving their noodles must come here personally. This policy brings both economic activity and connections to our otherwise remote, forgotten town filled with martial artists. Without outsiders visiting, we’d have faded into obscurity long ago.”

Intrigued, Guan Yu grew eager to taste these legendary noodles. Noticing his interest, Lin Zhonggeng said, “Qiaoqiao, take Guan Yu to try the noodles. Your mother and I will head home with the luggage. Don’t stay out too late.”

“Great! Let’s go!” Lin Qiaoqiao chirped, tugging Guan Yu’s arm as she skipped toward the Chen Family Noodle House. Guan Yu marveled at her uncharacteristic vivacity—he’d only known her as a fiery-tempered girl quick to argue or pout, never this playful.

Upon entering, Guan Yu gaped at the establishment’s grandeur. Despite its imposing exterior, the interior surpassed expectations: four stories of ancient-style architecture, with the first floor alone spanning over 500 square meters. The central hall resembled a marketplace atrium, its wooden staircase lacquered crimson leading to a bamboo-curtained second floor. “This place is massive—and packed!” he remarked.

“See? Even on regular days, it’s this busy,” Lin Qiaoqiao said, steering him toward a secluded first-floor table. The black square table and long benches exuded antiquity, a novel dining experience for Guan Yu.

As they settled, a server handed them a menu. Beyond Yangchun noodles, it offered simple sides and drinks—standard for any noodle shop catering to diverse tastes. “Two Yangchun noodles, soy sauce potato shreds, and soy sauce pork liver,” Lin Qiaoqiao ordered promptly, already holding out twenty yuan.

“You know the price by heart?” Guan Yu asked after the server left. “And why only those two dishes?” He’d intended to treat her to more, fearing the order seemed meager.

“This is plenty. They don’t allow leftovers to be taken, and these are their specialties,” she said, her eyes darting around the bustling hall. “No takeout? Unheard of! Even street vendors allow it nowadays. Why the restriction?”

Lin Qiaoqiao lowered her voice. “The Chen family’s century-old soy sauce recipe is their secret. They forbid takeout to prevent imitation. Without samples, no one can replicate it.”

Guan Yu scoffed, “With modern technology, duplicating a sauce’s flavor isn’t hard.”

“Exactly why they’re cautious. By keeping the sauce confined here, they’ve maintained their noodle’s uniqueness for generations,” she countered. Guan Yu now understood why the Chens rejected investors and chain expansions—their soy sauce’s secrecy was paramount.

Observing the kitchen through fogged glass, Guan Yu noticed an elderly man meticulously ladling sauce onto each noodle bowl via a conveyor belt. Nearby, a screen displayed the recipe: “A handful of thin noodles, half a bowl of broth, three drops of lard, one spoon of Chen family soy sauce, and two bok choy leaves.” The sauce’s centrality was undeniable.

When their steaming bowls arrived, Guan Yu marveled at the portion—generous for five yuan. The clear broth swirled with soy sauce, garnished with scallions and greens. Lin Qiaoqiao instructed, “Stir it so the sauce blends in.”

The first bite surprised him—a clean, savory flavor with a subtle umami hint, devoid of greasiness or overpowering seasonings. “The soy sauce truly elevates it,” he admitted.

“Told you!” she grinned. “Dad ate these as a child for two yuan a bowl. Even when he grew tired of them, he’d crave them again after a few days.”

As they left, Lin Qiaoqiao proposed a stroll through the flagstone-paved town. Rows of towering tile-roofed houses lined the streets, some adorned with cylindrical “chuanzi” structures on their roofs.

“Those aren’t chimneys,” she explained when Guan Yu pointed. “Each chuanzi represents a son in the household. No chuanzi means they have daughters. It’s an old tradition—boys were once celebrated extravagantly here.”

Guan Yu teased, “So when you were born, did your family mourn?”

“I was born in the city! My parents aren’t backward like that,” she retorted, gesturing at grander homes with ornate gates and dragon-decorated eaves. Wealth here wore its face openly, unlike the city’s homogenized apartments.

Walking past modest homes lacking walls or gates, Guan Yu mused on the visible divide between affluence and simplicity—a stark contrast to urban anonymity where wealth often hid behind identical facades.
