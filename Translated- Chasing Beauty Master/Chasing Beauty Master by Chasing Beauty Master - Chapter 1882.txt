“Prince Zou continued, ‘Therefore, I must go this time. If no one pacifies the disaster victims in the north, the situation may spiral out of control. Initially, the affected area was not vast, but as the displaced have received no aid—plundering and killing have left nearby resources exhausted and people slaughtered—the chaos has gradually spread to other regions.

This trend must be contained. Otherwise, it will grow irreparable. By then, pacification would become far more difficult. Though I cannot leave now, I must. Entrusting this matter to others would be unwise.’

**Chapter 4946: Offering Counsel**

Guan Yu had not expected Prince Zou to be so well-informed about the people’s plight. Whether his concern was genuine or feigned remained unclear.

Yet, from his words, the prince’s focus on aiding the victims—regardless of seeking merit—appeared commendable. Guan Yu knew the northern crisis was worsening. If unchecked, it might threaten Prince Zou’s Liao City, as the disaster zone lay close.

Perhaps fearing the Second Prince would seize control of relief efforts again—allowing embezzlement to persist and the crisis to eventually reach Liao City—Prince Zou resolved to act swiftly. Despite obligations binding him here, he sought Guan Yu’s help overseeing matters in the capital.

Guan Yu smiled. ‘Your Highness’s empathy is the people’s blessing. A ruler like you is rare. Yet you are right: the disaster funds must not fall into the Second Prince’s hands. But surely you know he will not relent if denied.’

‘I anticipate dangers,’ Prince Zou replied. ‘But with Hongren and his men guarding me, I am confident. I must deliver the funds swiftly and calm the spreading unrest.’

‘Your dedication to the people is admirable,’ Guan Yu said.

‘You flatter me, Brother Guan Yu. A ruler—whether virtuous or corrupt—depends on the people’s support. Lose that, and no position endures.’

‘Wise words. Yet aiding you in this matter is... complicated. My involvement could fuel rumors about the Crown Prince’s reliance on outsiders, damaging his standing with the Emperor.’

Such rumors might cost the Crown Prince the lucrative task of investigating the Cao family. Prince Zou acknowledged this, realizing Guan Yu’s unique status barred open alliance with the Crown Prince.

‘If this approach fails,’ Prince Zou asked, ‘do you have another solution?’

‘A simple one,’ Guan Yu said. ‘The Crown Prince must trust himself. Only self-reliance will resolve this.’

‘But this opportunity is too precious to lose!’ Prince Zou argued. ‘Rescuing Princess Jiangxin earned the Emperor’s favor. We cannot let the Second Prince steal this advantage.’

As Guan Yu ate, he mused on Prince Zou’s greed: hoarding both the northern relief credit and the Cao investigation, yet lacking the manpower. Reluctant to meddle in court affairs, Guan Yu saw no role for himself but proposed, ‘Let the Crown Prince consult Consort Guifen when uncertain. My direct involvement is unwise.’

‘Ah!’ Prince Zou exclaimed. ‘Appointing you as his advisor would legitimize your counsel!’

‘Spare me, Your Highness,’ Guan Yu refused. ‘I’ve no interest—or patience—for court matters. But consider this: the Crown Prince saved Princess Jiangxin. Seeking aid from the Grand Princess or Consort Jiang Yuankai would be fitting.’

Though Prince Zou pressed, Guan Yu stood firm, suggesting this alternative.

‘A sound idea,’ Prince Zou conceded. ‘But they avoid court factions. Would they help?’

‘Given the debt for Jiangxin’s rescue, perhaps. If not, I’ll approach Consort Jiang myself—though I make no promises.’

Guan Yu, wary of exposing his Yunqing Sect ties, agreed only to covert support. Satisfied, Prince Zou departed, unaware the Crown Prince secretly relied on Elder Xiang of the Yunqing Sect—Guan Yu’s rival—for counsel.

**Chapter 4947: A Suggestion**

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuankai urged returning home, but the Grand Princess refused. ‘The palace is safer. Those brigands might still target Jiangxin!’

‘The danger arose from your obsession with the East Sea Dragon Pearl!’ she rebuked.

Jiang Yuankai sighed. ‘At least credit Wan Hong for her rescue, not the Crown Prince.’

‘Nonsense! The Crown Prince brought her to the Emperor. Wan Hong merely assisted.’

‘But witnesses say otherwise—’

‘Must you contradict me?’ she snapped. ‘The Crown Prince is family. Why let outsiders claim glory?’

Jiang Yuankai warned, ‘Favoring him openly aligns us with his faction. Some may even accuse us of staging Jiangxin’s abduction to bolster him!’

‘Preposterous!’ she cried. ‘I’d never risk Jiangxin!’

‘Yet perceptions matter. Stay neutral.’

Relenting, she muttered, ‘Still, I’ll remain here. Home feels unsafe.’

**Chapter 4948: Insecurity**

Jiang Yuankai frowned. A wife refusing to return bespoke marital strife, but arguing was futile. ‘You’ve changed,’ he remarked. ‘Once, we faced perils together.’

‘Jiangxin’s safety outweighs all,’ she said.

He pressed, ‘Why credit the Crown Prince?’

‘Why not? Must Wan Hong profit?’

‘Rumors will claim you back his faction.’

‘Let them! I’ll not grovel to outsiders.’

Jiang Yuankai sighed. ‘The Emperor will decide. Our interference risks entanglement.’

She acquiesced grudgingly, though distrust of Wan Hong lingered. The East Sea Dragon Pearl’s allure had upended their lives, and suspicion clouded every alliance."
