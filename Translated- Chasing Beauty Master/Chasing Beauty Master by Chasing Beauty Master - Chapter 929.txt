“Just as Amei learned the news and began inquiring about Guan Yu, she discovered he was nowhere to be found at Huayu Group when she went to look for him. His whereabouts remained unknown.

Amei had even personally visited Huayu Group to gather information, but not only did she fail to find Guan Yu—she couldn’t even catch a glimpse of the two beautiful top executives on the highest floor.

Despite being a rising star, a colossal entity like Huayu Group paid no attention to someone of Amei’s stature. Yet she refused to give up, continuing her search for Guan Yu.

Later, by chance, Amei received news that Guan Yu had appeared in City A.

This coincided with the Yang family’s announcement of betrothing Yang Conghan to Guan Yu. Overnight, Guan Yu became the renowned son-in-law of the Yangs, the leading family among the Four Great Clans—a sensational development that thrust him into the spotlight.

It was during this time that Amei heard rumors of Guan Yu’s presence in City A, though she couldn’t confirm if it was the same man she sought. She decided to hold a concert there. Despite Guan Yu’s reluctance to attend, several companions, including Yang Conghan, persuaded him.

Wei Hongwei, in particular, clamored to go, even begging Guan Yu to secure concert tickets. Thus, Guan Yu attended—and it was there that Amei finally reunited with the man she’d yearned for day and night.

After reminiscing about Amei’s painful past, Guan Yu glanced at the late hour and said softly, “What’s past is past. Don’t dwell on it too much. One must look forward. Let go of old burdens and focus on what lies ahead. That’s how you’ll find true happiness.”

“I do feel happy and blessed now,” Amei murmured, “but… I don’t want life to move forward.”

Guan Yu blinked. “Why not?” He assumed lingering regrets weighed on her. “Holding onto sorrow will only suffocate your joy and burden your life.”

Amei smiled sweetly. “Because I want time to stand still. If life stays rooted here, I’ll remain by your side forever… and never lose you.”

“Ah, clever girl!” Guan Yu chuckled, tapping her delicate nose. “Wishing to halt time so you’ll never age—a fantasy all women share, hm?”

“Enough chatter. It’s late,” he added. “Sleep is vital for preserving youth. Staying up ruins the complexion. Understood?”

At his words—“Let’s go to sleep”—Amei’s face flushed crimson. She buried herself in his chest, too flustered to process anything else.

Seeing her bashful demeanor, Guan Yu’s interest stirred. He swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bedroom.

***

The next day, Guan Yu received an unknown call—a rarity, as he typically ignored such numbers. This time, he answered.

Before he could speak, a cheerful female voice chirped, “Is this Big Brother Guan Yu?”

**Chapter Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Six: Running Around**

For reasons unclear even to himself—and despite the late hour—Guan Yu felt unusually spirited.

The following morning, he again answered a strange call. The moment he connected, the same lively voice greeted him: “Is this Big Brother Guan Yu?”

Guan Yu checked the number, confirming it was unfamiliar. “I’m Guan Yu. Who’s this?”

“How could you forget me so soon?” the voice teased. “Just a few days apart, and you’ve erased me from your mind? Nobles truly have short memories!”

Beside him, Amei stirred awake, her late rise due to last night’s exertions. Normally, she’d have prepared breakfast by now.

Before Guan Yu could respond, Amei smiled drowsily. “I’ll make breakfast. We can’t let everyone starve.”

“Go ahead,” Guan Yu nodded.

The caller giggled. “Oh, Big Brother, just waking up now? You’re as much a sleepyhead as me!”

Recognition dawned. “Qu Shuangshuang! I thought it was a wrong number. What brings your call today?”

“I’ve always had time! You’re the busy one!” she retorted. “I’m visiting Mom at the hospital during summer break. Missed you, so I called!”

Guan Yu suddenly recalled his overdue visit to treat her aunt. The previous session was half a month prior—delayed by a week due to recent chaos.

“Wait at the hospital. I’ll come shortly,” he promised.

“Yay! I’ve missed you!” Qu Shuangshuang exclaimed, hopping by her mother’s bed. After hanging up, Guan Yu realized summer vacation had begun. She’d likely obtained his number from her mother.

His mind drifted to the night before Qu Meimei’s wedding, recalling Shuangshuang’s alluring presence in her western room.

Amei headed to the kitchen, only to find Xue Jing had already prepared breakfast. Xue Jing, Zhang Han, and Lü Mei sat eating at the table.

Upon descending, Amei faced their knowing stares. Blushing under their scrutiny, she stammered, “You… didn’t call me for breakfast?”

“We tried,” Lü Mei said slyly, “but you weren’t in your room. Then we spotted your… *ahem*… undergarments outside Guan Yu’s door. Didn’t want to interrupt your… festivities.”

Xue Jing huffed. “He ignores me after I trail him everywhere! Snatches Amei away—what fairness is that?”

“He hasn’t touched me in ages!” Zhang Han pouted.

“He treats me like air!” Lü Mei snapped.

Their banter mortified Amei, though she secretly reveled in their envy. Head bowed, she hurried to wash up.

Guan Yu emerged, stretching. “Amei cooked already? Smells amazing!”

Xue Jing fumed. Her efforts went unnoticed, credit stolen!

Noticing the trio’s icy glares, Guan Yu scratched his head. “Why the stares? Why didn’t you wake me?”

“After last night’s *racket*?” Xue Jing retorted. “We barely slept! And you dare ask for breakfast?”

In the bathroom, Amei—startled by the remark—slipped, barely catching herself on the sink. Had she really been so loud? She’d tried to muffle herself…

Guan Yu defused the tension. “Couldn’t sleep. Amei kept me company. Let’s not dwell.”

“We were gaming all night!” Lü Mei complained. “You never checked on us—just moaned with her!”

Xue Jing added, “I cooked, yet you praise *her*? Revolting!”

**Chapter Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Seven: Where to Today**

“Enough,” Guan Yu sighed. “Xue Jing, change clothes. We’re heading out.”

Zhang Han leaped into his lap, disrupting his meal. The table overflowed with congee, side dishes, cornbread, and milk.

As Guan Yu reached for chopsticks, Xue Jing barked, “Wash first! You reek of last night’s sweat!”

Zhang Han pinched her nose cutely. “Ew, Big Brother! Shower!”

Laughter erupted. Amei reappeared, demure. “I drew your bathwater, Guan Yu.”

Caught between three scowling women and one angelic Amei, Guan Yu marveled at life’s richness.

Post-breakfast, Guan Yu endured his daily ordeal: waiting for Xue Jing’s outfit changes. Today, she emerged in thirty minutes—a record.

Dressed in a translucent pink mini-dress, she resembled a princess. “Where to?” she asked in the car.

“Visiting an elderly woman I aided long ago,” Guan Yu said. “Haven’t seen her in ages.”

“When do you shop?” he asked. “You’re always in pajamas at home.”

Xue Jing glared. “You’re never home! We sneak out with your suffocating bodyguards. Can’t even flirt with men!”

Guilt pricked Guan Yu. He’d neglected them.

***

At the hospital, Guan Yu led Xue Jing to Madam Qu’s private suite. Inside, a doctor chatted with the bedridden aunt while Qu Shuangshuang lounged on another bed, swinging socked feet and humming.

“Brother Guan Yu’s here!” Shuangshuang squealed, bouncing.

Xue Jing eyed the vivacious girl, suspecting Guan Yu’s “charity” had ulterior motives.

The doctor updated Guan Yu: “Her recovery progresses well. Rest is key.”

Madam Qu smiled weakly. “No need to visit so often. I can walk now.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Eight: Jealousy Games**

As Guan Yu conversed, Qu Shuangshuang gaped at Xue Jing’s flawless beauty—a sculpted masterpiece without flaw.

The aunt and doctor turned at the commotion. Guan Yu inquired about treatments, while Xue Jing simmered, convinced he’d rescued the family solely to charm the daughter.

In the Qu women’s eyes, Guan Yu had morphed into an incorrigible philanderer—yet they couldn’t help adoring him nonetheless.
