Here is the:

At this moment, Guan Yu was on his way to the Song Family residence when he received the Crown Prince's call. He wasn't surprised. The Crown Prince, revered by all young masters in the capital, was no fool like those aligned with the Song Family. If he couldn't discern the intricacies of this conflict, Guan Yu would have been sorely disappointed.

"Whether I need your help or not, you know better than I do! What should be done—I trust you understand without further elaboration!"

Without waiting for a response, Guan Yu abruptly ended the call. Tang Xiao, driving in front, shook his head with a bitter smile. Among all the young masters of prominent families, only Guan Yu would dare speak so bluntly to the Crown Prince of the capital!

It seemed he still needed to work harder to surpass this man.

"Crown Prince, when the current situation clearly favors the Song Family over Guan Yu, why are we still choosing to stand on his side?"

Li Yu couldn't comprehend the Crown Prince's reasoning. He knew the Crown Prince feared Guan Yu more than Song Shaoqin. Since helping Guan Yu might create a powerful enemy, why not take this opportunity to crush him?

"Li Yu, do you know why you lost your family's influence in the conflict with Guan Yu?" The Crown Prince walked to the window, gazing outside with detachment.

"I don't!" Li Yu answered honestly after a pause. The loss of his family's standing still rankled him. Though Guan Yu's current strength was formidable, he remained resentful about being defeated by this outsider.

How could a provincial upstart destroy two decades of family legacy with his bare hands?

"A person's strength manifests in many forms—scheming, backing, vision. Anything that aids you counts as power. Yet all these pale before fortune. When heaven favors a man, his rise becomes inevitable."

The Crown Prince's tone remained neutral, neither admiring nor envious. "How many of Guan Yu's women are ordinary? Could an average man make such exceptional women utterly devoted? This is Guan Yu's fortune and discernment—both qualities you lack. Li Yu, if you can't view Guan Yu objectively, our future will remain precarious."

This final statement served as a warning for Li Yu to abandon his hatred and face Guan Yu with equanimity.

Li Yu took a deep breath and nodded. "Understood."

"I know what's in your heart. Our cooperation with Guan Yu is temporary—opportunities will come. Now, go find Dongfang Mu."

"Yes, Crown Prince!"

As Li Yu withdrew, the Crown Prince remained by the window, his expression inscrutable. "Guan Yu... I must admit your luck is formidable, making the higher-ups abandon Song Family to protect you. But how long will this fortune last? I await with interest..."

Meanwhile, at the Song Residence:

"Father, why would the Taiwan Song Family withdraw without warning? Don't they realize this leaves us vulnerable?"

Song Shaoqin paced restlessly, his usual aristocratic composure shattered. The Taiwan branch's sudden withdrawal had stunned the entire family.

Their Taiwanese connections had been the delicate thread keeping the authorities lenient toward the Song Family's "audacious actions." Without this buffer, even setting aside the higher-ups, Guan Yu's faction alone could overwhelm them.

"The exact reason remains unclear. Rumor says their backyard caught fire in Taiwan, forcing them to focus there."

The mainland Song Family had received only vague explanations about "urgent matters" requiring attention in Taiwan.

"Could this be Guan Yu's doing?" Song Shaoqin speculated. The Li Family's earlier withdrawal had been due to Guan Yu's local support from Emperor Group in Hong Kong. It stood to reason Guan Yu might have employed similar tactics against the Taiwan branch.

"Uncertain." Song Shaoqin's father shook his head. Their intelligence on Taiwan's situation was limited. Though aware of four major families rivaling the Songs there, these clans shared deep ties—internal strife seemed improbable.

What then was the true cause?

As they pondered, several collateral family members entered. "Shaoqin-ge, the situation worsens! Our allied families suffer heavy losses in business and politics. Many minor clans have collapsed entirely. What should we do?"

"Expendable pawns matter not. Tell them to keep resisting—say we've contacted the American Song Family to negotiate with the higher-ups. I refuse to believe Guan Yu's coalition of Eastern and Jiang Families can withstand our assault!"

"But—"

"No buts! Make it happen!"

Song Shaoqin irritably cut off his cousin. As he turned to consult his father, a calm voice interrupted: "Master Song seems troubled."

"Guan Yu!" Song Shaoqin's eyes blazed crimson at the sight of the visitor. "What brings you here?"

"I feared I might never see my old friend again. Came for a final visit."

The barb nearly choked Song Shaoqin with rage. Final visit? Did this upstart think victory assured?

"So you're Guan Yu?" Song Tianxiang, Shaoqin's father, observed the young man matching his son's age but radiating sharper composure. His heart sank—this poise alone outshone his heir.

"You must be Uncle Song. Greetings."

Guan Yu nodded courteously.

"Guan Yu, our family underestimated you. But don't rejoice—the final laugh remains undecided!"

Song Tianxiang's cold snort carried warning. (Note: The original Chinese mentioned a website prompt here which has been omitted per translation rules.)

"Wise words, Uncle. The last laugh defines the true victor. Yet current circumstances favor us. Does this not concern you?"

Guan Yu sat unceremoniously before Song Tianxiang, demeanor relaxed yet piercing.

Paradoxically, though physically lower, Guan Yu's presence seemed to loom over the standing Song Tianxiang. "Concerned? About you devouring our family? The Song Clan has dominated the capital for decades—how could a whelp like you compare?"

Guan Yu shook his head. "Uncle still misreads the situation. Your family's past dominance is undeniable, yet now you merely match me. In this alone, you've already lost ground."

His words held truth. When Guan Yu first arrived in the capital, the Songs could have crushed him like an ant. Yet within months, he stood as their equal—proof of fortune's fickleness.

"Even so, Guan Yu! The final victor won't be you! Never you!"

Song Shaoqin's frenzied shout drew disdainful looks from Tang Xiao and even his disappointed father. The heir's composure had shattered completely.

As word spread of Guan Yu's arrival, the Song compound filled with family members. The current patriarch, Song Jiadi—Shaoqin's great-grandfather and second-generation leader—entered surrounded by retainers.

At over a century old, Song Jiadi moved with the vigor of a man in his sixties, his ruddy complexion belying advanced age. No wonder he retained patriarchal authority.

"So this is the whelp who's brought you to your knees?"

Song Jiadi's piercing gaze settled on Guan Yu, drawing ashamed looks from the Song clansmen.

"Young man, you impress." The patriarch's approval shifted abruptly to sternness. "Yet striking my grandson and provoking our family shows grave disrespect!"

"Respect or not, actions speak. If Elder Song means to lecture me with seniority, spare the effort."

Guan Yu stood unbowed.

"Bravo!" Song Jiadi advanced coldly. "Do you not fear we'll detain you to pressure your allies?"

The patriarch's decades-honed authority forced Tang Xiao back a step. Guan Yu remained unaffected, meeting the elder's gaze squarely. "Attempt it, and I guarantee the Song Family's destruction will outpace your worst fears!"

"You think this old man fears empty threats?"

"Empty? Do I strike you as a bluffer?" Guan Yu's smile radiated unshakable confidence.

As silence fell, Guan Yu continued: "Elder Song, your wisest course is surrender. Thus might your family's foundations endure."

"Surrender? You presume to command the Song Family?" Song Shaoqin spat. Withdrawal now would sacrifice not just power but reputation—who would follow a family abandoning its allies?

Guan Yu shrugged. "You reject counsel? Then blame none but yourselves. Pray the Song name survives tomorrow."

He turned to leave, only to be blocked by Song retainers.

"Detaining me now?" Guan Yu's amused tone betrayed no anxiety.

"Let him pass!" Song Jiadi commanded.

"But Patriarch—"

"Make way!"

The retainers parted. Guan Yu laughed heartily and swaggered out under hostile gazes.

"Great-grandfather, why release him? We could have used him as leverage!"

Song Shaoqin burned to capture this nemesis. Song Jiadi's reproving look softened to a sigh. "Child, remember the higher-ups watch our conflict. Illegal detention would bring their wrath upon us."

"You think they'd attack us for Guan Yu?"

The heir found this inconceivable given their family's entrenched influence.

"Overmighty subjects invite imperial suspicion." The patriarch sank into his chair. "In our expansion, we forgot this truth. I suspect the authorities use Guan Yu to curb our power. Would they permit harming their chosen tool? Guan Yu came boldly because he knows this."

The analysis shocked listeners. Indeed, the Song Family's unchecked growth and arrogance had drawn governmental displeasure. Without Guan Yu's provocation, they might never have realized this impending reckoning.

"Then what should we do, Great-grandfather?"

Chapter 1089: The Arrogant Guan Yu

"Humph!" Song Jiadi's expression hardened. "The authorities won't find us easy prey. Since retreat proves impossible, we fight to the end!"

Understanding the government's indirect strategy paradoxically freed the patriarch. Official intervention would remain covert—this would be a true clan war. Victory would elevate the Songs further.

"Contact the American Song Family. I'll speak with their patriarch myself."

Song Jiadi knew governmental backing made Guan Yu formidable. Drawing their overseas branch into the fray became essential...

"Master Guan, why reveal the authorities' stance to the Songs? Doesn't this disadvantage us?"

Tang Xiao remained perplexed. Forcing the Songs to fight desperately seemed counterproductive.

"You think they'd surrender after my warning?" Guan Yu's sidelong glance held hidden depths.

After consideration, Tang Xiao ventured: "They'll fight relentlessly."

A top-tier family wouldn't capitulate to mere words.

"Precisely. I want their desperate struggle." Guan Yu's eyes gleamed. "The authorities want moderation, but half-measures leave smoldering threats. I'll eradicate this danger completely—lest it become a weapon against me later."

Tang Xiao grasped the logic but voiced new concern: "Won't destroying the Songs alarm the higher-ups?"

Guan Yu nodded. "Hence we must appear battered in victory. Post-triumph, we'll shift focus overseas—lull their vigilance."

His plan was set: after crushing the Songs, redirect energies to pharmaceutical ventures, letting domestic affairs cool.

"Where to now?"

"The Hu Family."

As Tang Xiao turned the car toward Hu Zongze's residence, news of Guan Yu's bold visit and safe exit from Song territory spread through the capital. The implications shook the Song faction:

How dare he be so audacious?

Why didn't the Songs act?

Were they surrendering?

If so, what of their allies?
