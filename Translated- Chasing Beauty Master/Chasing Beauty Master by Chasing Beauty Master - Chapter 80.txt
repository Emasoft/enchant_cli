“Young man, come… take a look at my raw jade materials. These are all old mine material from Mowanki. See this eel-skin rough? Absolutely worth a gamble!” The neighboring stall owner, seeing his competitor’s provocation had already sold a piece, hastily greeted Guan Yu with equal enthusiasm.

“Hmm… let’s see!” Guan Yu played along with exaggerated nonchalance, grinning as he stopped before the stall.

“How much… for this one?” Guan Yu casually patted a scaly-surfaced rough stone.

“This… well, 150,000. For you, young man, 120,000!” The vendor chuckled obsequiously.

Guan Yu paused, chewing his chocolate as he studied the vendor’s eyes. After a moment, he waved dismissively. “35,000. I’ll take it now if you agree.”

“Ah! Such haggling is unheard of!” The vendor clutched his chest in theatrical dismay.

“Look at this tiny pebble! Proportionally speaking, compared to the 400,000 piece I just bought, 35,000 is generous!”

“Young man, you misunderstand. Whether jade emerges has nothing to do with size—it’s about the quality beneath the surface!”

Guan Yu tilted his chin arrogantly. “Enough chatter. 35,000—yes or no?”

Through his detection skill, Guan Yu already knew this stone had sat neglected for three months. Its ambiguous pine-flower patterns and scales deterred buyers, including the vendor himself who considered it unlikely to yield jade. Moreover, it had been a free add-on during his old mine purchase—initially priced at 30,000-50,000, yet no one had even inquired.

Such stones—neither promising nor worthless—were shunned by cautious gamblers. Guan Yu’s fair offer left the vendor wavering.

“Young brother, can’t you add a little more?”

“Take it or leave it.” Guan Yu smiled serenely.

“Fine! 35,000!” The vendor gritted his teeth.

The stone contained a lighter-sized emerald strip. Cross-referencing online jade charts, Guan Yu estimated six-figure value.

After swift payment, Niu Le hoisted another stone. More vendors beckoned as they progressed.

“Youngster, examine mine! Not old mine material, but jade hides anywhere!” Another vendor urged, emboldened by Guan Yu’s spending.

“Alright, let’s see…” Guan Yu crossed his arms, surveying stones like a casual shopper.

Observers smirked—this novice didn’t even inspect stones properly! Yet he kept purchasing like a profligate heir.

After two more acquisitions, Niu Le struggled under the load. A kind vendor rented them a reinforced steel cart—capable of holding tons. Empowered, Guan Yu piled stones recklessly.

“Young man, you should cut them open! What’s the point of hoarding?” An elderly onlooker admonished.

“No rush. Luck strikes eventually.” Guan Yu waved dismissively.

Twelve stones later—some barren, some promising—his total surpassed 1.5 million yuan. Niu Le, sweating, suggested testing their haul.

At a jade workshop, the master carver eyed their cart. “Which first?”

Guan Yu handed a barren stone. The master measured meticulously before slicing—nothing. Crowd sighs followed.

Another dud. “Pity! I expected apple-green here,” the master lamented.

Guan Yu grinned, selecting a grayish stone. “Maybe this one’s lucky!”

The master’s blade grazed emerald edges perfectly. Gasps erupted—“It’s rising! Look at that water head and color!”

“How much?” Guan Yu feigned shock.

“At least 600,000 now. Continue?” the master asked.

Through detection, Guan Yu confirmed 700,000 potential. “Cut here!” He pointed precisely where the master would’ve calculated.

The second slice deepened the green. Bidding wars erupted—66,000 settled instantly.

Subsequent stones brought more wins. When ice-grade jade emerged, frenzy peaked. A well-dressed observer approached during the 640,000 yuan transaction.

“Young friend, might we speak privately?” The man proposed a premium purchase.

As money transferred, Guan Yu’s instincts prickled—danger loomed. In this border town, flashing newfound wealth was asking for trouble...
