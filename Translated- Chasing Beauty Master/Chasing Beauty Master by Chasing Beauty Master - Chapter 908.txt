“At this moment, Sakurako’s voice came through the phone again: ‘Though I don’t know what cultivation realm you were in back then, I know you were incredibly powerful, fearlessly soaring through the skies with me. Oh, and you defeated our Ah Shen (The Deity).’

Sakurako seemed to speak while reminiscing, ‘Back when we first met, you actually came on a mission. Then you took me to challenge Ah Shen. But when Ah Shen saw you, he didn’t dare strike. Later, as we left, Ah Shen furiously attacked us from behind. You carried me as we flew through the sky.

Ah Shen’s overwhelming attacks relentlessly pursued us—they were utterly terrifying, capable of overturning rivers and flattening mountains. Yet even his strikes couldn’t harm us. I was terrified, but you calmly kept flying. Not a single one of Ah Shen’s attacks touched us.

If we consider this, Ah Shen was a god in our eyes—a master of the Sovereign Realm. Yet you completely ignored his assaults. That must mean you were at the peak of the Sovereign Realm back then, right? Did I analyze this correctly?’

After Sakurako finished speaking, Guan Yu remained lost in thought. *So I was once a peak Sovereign Realm expert? But what exactly is Ah Shen?* He asked abruptly into the phone, ‘Sakurako, who is this Ah Shen?’

After posing the question, Guan Yu thought of Second Only to Wolf (The One Beneath the Wolf). He probably knew about Ah Shen. Just as Guan Yu turned to ask him, he noticed Second Only to Wolf’s jaw hung open like a black hole, revealing the contents of his stomach.

‘Do you know who this Ah Shen Sakurako mentioned is? Is he powerful?’ Guan Yu asked, amused by Second Only to Wolf’s comical expression.

‘Damn! The peak of the Sovereign Realm? This can’t be real! My future brother-in-law is a peak Sovereign Realm expert? How am I supposed to live with dignity now? This is madness!’ Second Only to Wolf muttered in shock, ignoring Guan Yu’s question.

Sakurako’s voice returned through the phone: ‘Ah Shen is a god-like figure in our nation—our greatest warrior, revered as a deity. That’s why everyone calls him Ah Shen.’

‘What’s his cultivation level?’ Guan Yu pressed, though Sakurako hadn’t addressed the key point.

‘Ah Shen should be at the Sovereign Realm, at minimum. Reaching the Sovereign Realm is every cultivator’s dream, but few ever attain it,’ Sakurako explained.

Guan Yu pondered silently, savoring Sakurako’s words. *If Ah Shen is at least Sovereign Realm, and I ignored his attacks, does that mean I was at the peak of the Sovereign Realm?*

He suddenly burst into laughter. *Hah! So I was once a god-tier expert!* His guffaws snapped Second Only to Wolf from his daze.

Initially stunned by Sakurako’s revelation, Second Only to Wolf had short-circuited. Now regaining composure, he glared at Guan Yu. ‘Seriously! How does a peak Sovereign Realm expert like you get beaten up and sealed? Are you a fraud? How embarrassing!’

Guan Yu continued smirking, but before he could retort, Sakurako interjected with mock anger: ‘Brother! No swearing! Don’t insult Guan Yu, and don’t curse in front of us—or I’ll never forgive you!’

**Chapter 2,323: Slaughtering the Donkey After It’s Done Grinding**

Second Only to Wolf froze. In his memory, Sakurako always doted on him. *Since when did she start siding with an outsider?*

‘What a pathetic older brother I’ve become! Fine, have it your way,’ he sighed. *Once a sister finds her man, she forgets her family. Though it stings, her happiness matters most.*

Guan Yu chuckled at Second Only to Wolf’s plight. ‘Remember—no more swearing. Or I’ll tattle to Sakurako.’

‘Ungrateful brats! You sweet-talk me when useful, then discard me like trash? This is pure betrayal!’ Second Only to Wolf protested.

‘Don’t misunderstand,’ Guan Yu grinned. ‘This isn’t betrayal—it’s slaughtering the donkey after it’s done grinding!’

Sakurako’s giggles joined Guan Yu’s laughter. Second Only to Wolf could only seethe silently, biting back curses to avoid Sakurako’s wrath.

‘Humph! The two of you gang up on me. Arguing would make me look petty,’ he huffed, salvaging his pride.

After composing himself, Guan Yu asked Sakurako seriously: ‘Do you know anything else about my past?’

‘Not much—we only spent a few days together. But I recall you came to our country on a mission about human experimentation—creating artificial mutants by forcibly turning ordinary people into cultivators. You left after stopping it, promising to return for me after handling something in the Arctic’s extreme cold regions. But you never came back...’

Her voice trailed off sorrowfully. Guan Yu listened but found no memories to anchor her words.

Second Only to Wolf interjected: ‘If you were sealed after going to the Arctic, something powerful there must’ve caused it. You should revisit that place—it might help recover your memories.’

Guan Yu nodded. ‘Agreed. But I’ll need time. Going now as a Second-Class Sovereign would be risky—whatever subdued a peak Sovereign might still lurk there.’

With little else revealed, Second Only to Wolf announced: ‘Sakurako! Guan Yu and I are in the West now. Once he finishes his task here, he’ll bring you to Qiaoyuan District!’

‘Really? Truly?’ Sakurako squealed, rushing to a mirror to inspect her flawless features. *I must look perfect—Qiaoyuan’s women are legendary beauties. I’ll match them!*

‘Of course! When have I lied?’ Second Only to Wolf affirmed.

‘You promised to stop swearing, yet today—!’ Sakurako countered.

‘Still my sister? Must you embarrass me before Guan Yu?’ he groaned.

Guan Yu smirked. ‘Why fear shame in front of family? Right, Sakurako?’

Her cheeks burned crimson at his implicit acknowledgment of their bond. Second Only to Wolf sighed internally—*My dear sister now belongs to another. But her joy is what matters.*

‘Sakurako, I’ll fetch you after this mission. Wait for me,’ Guan Yu vowed.

‘Mm,’ she whispered. As they prepared to hang up, she cried: ‘Wait!’

**Chapter 2,324: A Supreme Expert’s Power**

‘Do you remember the golden dagger you gave me?’ Sakurako asked urgently.

‘I only learned of it from your brother today. My memories...’

‘You entrusted it to me before leaving, insisting it was vital. You said to return it when we reunited—that it’d help you. Maybe it’s a Sovereign Relic to break your seal?’

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. *Peak Sovereigns possess prescience. Did I foresee my sealing and leave this key?*

‘Brilliant! Have your brother bring it tomorrow. It might restore my memories!’

‘Of course!’ Sakurako agreed.

After hanging up, Guan Yu marveled. *Peak Sovereigns transcend mortality—no need for food or sleep, wielding supernatural abilities like foresight. If that dagger is a Sovereign Relic...*

His yearning to regain memories burned fiercely.

As dusk fell, Guan Yu turned to Second Only to Wolf. ‘Stay tonight. Jinhua’s prepared a feast—I can smell it. Let’s eat.’

They entered the villa to find diligent Ah Cai still cultivating. Jinhou called out: ‘Perfect timing! Wash up—dinner’s ready!’

‘Your nose never fails,’ she teased. ‘Ah Cai didn’t notice the aroma mid-cultivation, yet you caught it from outside!’
