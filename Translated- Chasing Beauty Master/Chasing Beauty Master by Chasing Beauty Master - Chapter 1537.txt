**Chapter 3986: Stealing Livelihoods**

Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi grew frustrated. What were they to do now? Wang Jun stood and declared, “Everyone, remain calm. Form an orderly line. I’ll stay here all night to resolve your concerns. There’s no need to rush—take your time.”

Xiao Zhi added, “If you keep crowding like this, no one will get their turn. That helps no one!”

“Get the hell out of my way, all of you!”

Suddenly, a shout erupted from outside. Wang Jun recognized the voice—the drunkard from earlier had returned. The troublemaker had actually come back for a fight.

The crowd, previously jostling in urgency, fell silent at the roar. Everyone turned to see what new commotion had arisen.

“You fraud! I’m here to settle accounts!” The man stormed in, flanked by several tough-looking companions. “Today, I’ll smash your damned stall!”

Xiao Zhi bristled. They’d been enjoying their little game of deception, only to face this disruption. He rose, ready to confront the drunkard—he feared no brawl—but Wang Jun swiftly pulled him back. If Xiao Zhi acted recklessly, their “master” persona would crumble.

Wang Jun addressed the drunkard calmly, “I’m occupied with serving these patrons. Kindly refrain from disturbing us. Whatever grievance you hold can be addressed later.”

“Screw you!” The man spat. “I’m here to beat you senseless and reclaim my silver!”

Wang Jun’s earlier words had been strategic. He pressed on, “My patrons’ time is precious. Hindering me matters little, but wasting *their* hours is another matter.”

“Exactly! Stop causing trouble and leave!”

“How dare you disrespect the master! We’re waiting for our fortunes!”

One complaint ignited the crowd. Soon, accusations flew like arrows, escalating into outright curses.

Though the drunkard had brought muscle, the sheer number of angry townsfolk gave him pause. Offending so many was unwise.

“Are you all fools?” he protested. “He’s no master—just a swindler! Don’t believe a word he says!”

“*You’re* the liar!” someone retorted. “We’ve seen the master’s powers firsthand!”

Many others voiced support for Wang Jun, their faith unshaken.

Wang Jun feigned serenity. “A fraud? Such claims demand proof. What have I supposedly stolen from you? Enlighten us.”

The drunkard brandished a rusted cleaver. “You cheated me of two taels of silver! Return it now, or I’ll take your life!”

“Preposterous.” Wang Jun scoffed. “Why would someone of my stature swindle pocket change? Two taels mean nothing to me.”

An elderly man interceded, “Leave now, young man. This master wields immortal arts. Provoke him, and you’ll regret it!”

Another added, “He showed his powers earlier! If he wished, a flick of his wrist would send you flying. Do you court death?”

**Chapter 3986: Stealing Livelihoods (Continued)**

The crowd’s jeers grew overwhelming. The drunkard had intended to thrash this “charlatan” with his brothers, never anticipating such united opposition.

Wang Jun’s gaze then fell on two figures in the crowd—the master and apprentice from a nearby acrobatics troupe. Their hostile glares unsettled him. While the drunkard could be chased off, these performers might recognize them. Trouble loomed.

He nudged Xiao Zhi discreetly. “See those two? They’re watching us. Stay alert—if they expose us, the game’s over.”

Xiao Zhi glanced over. The pair now approached. Had they been recognized? Unlikely—Xiao Zhi’s face was buried under a fake beard, and Wang Jun had swapped his earlier female disguise for male attire.

The crowd hushed as the performers neared, leaving even the drunkard bewildered.

The younger acrobat accused, “Where’s your decency? We perform nearby, yet you steal our audience with your fortune-telling! Move your con elsewhere!”

Wang Jun replied coolly, “This street belongs to none. Your stage and our stall share no conflict. Why dictate where we practice our craft?”

“No conflict?” The youth sneered. “You’ve siphoned our crowd! We perform to empty seats because of you!”

Wang Jun sat, impassive. “The people choose where to linger. If your act fails to captivate, blame not us.”

“This is about basic courtesy! We were here first!”

“By that logic, must every newcomer seek your permission?” Wang Jun countered. “The street is free to all—peddlers, performers, strollers alike. Who are you to claim dominion?”

He added, “Perhaps your act simply... lacks appeal.”

The drunkard, sensing an alliance, shouted, “They’re frauds stealing your trade! Let’s wreck their stall together!”

The acrobat pressed, “Regardless, you must leave! Your presence ruins our livelihood!”

Xiao Zhi snapped, “What gives you the right? Your tricks deceive these good people! We’ve spared you exposure—be grateful!”

Wang Jun subtly tugged Xiao Zhi’s sleeve, reminding him to maintain their “master” decorum.

“If you value discretion,” Wang Jun warned the performers, “leave now. Must I unveil your deceptions?”

The younger acrobat paled. His elder companion—a middle-aged man with a glued-on beard—barked, “Lies! Our feats are genuine skill!”

Wang Jun rose, the crowd parting as if swept by an invisible wind. “Very well. Let me demonstrate your tricks.”

He strode to the acrobats’ stage, seized a gong, and struck it. “Gather round! Witness their swindles exposed!”

**Chapter 3987: Explanations for Later**

Spectators flocked, eager for drama. Wang Jun hefted a sledgehammer beside the “chest-crushing stone” used in their act. Channeling spiritual power into his arms, he shattered the prop.

“Observe the fractures,” he announced. “Fresh breaks show lighter interiors. These cracks are old—glued and disguised. A light tap completes the ‘miracle.’”

The crowd erupted in anger. The acrobats gaped—their years-long scam, exposed.

Wang Jun moved to their “boiling oil” cauldron. The fire beneath had died, leaving the liquid lukewarm. He dipped his hand in. “No ‘iron palm’ art here. This pot holds oil atop water. When heated, steam bubbles mimic boiling. The mix stays cool enough for bare hands.”

Xiao Zhi reignited the flame. Soon, bubbles surfaced. Wang Jun plunged his hand in again, unharmed. Xiao Zhi followed suit, feeling only warmth.

“Deceivers!” the crowd roared. “Return our silver!”

The performers bolted, abandoning their props. In their flight, the older man’s fake beard tore off—revealing another youth. The mob gave chase, but the pair vanished like hares.

Wang Jun checked the time. “Enough fun. We should rest—Prince Zou will want to depart early.”

“Master, stay!” A man blocked their path. “Read my fortune! Tell my financial prospects!”

Wang Jun waved him off. “Not tonight. Perhaps tomorrow.”

But the crowd swarmed, desperate for his wisdom.

“Enough!” Wang Jun raised his hands. “Return tomorrow evening. I’ll address all then. Now, disperse!”

Escaping the throng, they found the drunkard waiting. Silverless and furious, he cornered them with his gang.

“Return my money!” he demanded. “No crowd to protect you now!”

Wang Jun’s voice turned icy. “Persist, and you’ll regret it.”

The drunkard signaled his men. Xiao Zhi grinned—finally, a chance to test the spiritual power he’d absorbed after cleansing his blood curse.

Whipping out his copper lock artifact, Xiao Zhi summoned a gale that hurled the attackers backward. They crashed meters away, groaning.

The drunkard gaped. “S-Sorcerers!” He and his crew fled, terror-stricken.

**Chapter 3988: Silver Talks**

Walking back, Xiao Zhi chuckled. “Those tricks of yours—even I nearly believed them! How’d the coin-string not burn?”

Wang Jun smiled. “The rope was soaked in brine and coated with lime. Delays combustion. Simple alchemy.”

“Where’d you learn such cons?”

“Another time,” Wang Jun deflected. They paused outside a brothel’s glowing lanterns.

Xiao Zhi yawned. “Let’s just rest.”

Wang Jun eyed the establishment. “Perhaps… silver might smooth tomorrow’s journey.”

Xiao Zhi groaned. “Must we?”

Wang Jun’s grin widened. “When has coin ever failed us?”
