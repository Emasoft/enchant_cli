After becoming intimate with Guan Yu, Yang Cong’s heart became wholly consumed by him. Yet his aloofness toward her only deepened her longing, which grew stronger with each passing day.

Previously, when Guan Yu sought her help, she readily assisted without hesitation. But now, traces of resentment had begun to surface. Guan Yu believed the time was not yet ripe to show Yang Conghan excessive concern.

He needed to wait for the precise moment when Yang Conghan would feel she could not live in this world without him. Only then would she be deemed “qualified” in his eyes.

Guan Yu also harbored no fear that another man might enter Yang Conghan’s heart, for he remained her sole choice.

After Yang Conghan left, Ling’er remarked, “Brother Guan, do you think Sister Yang was jealous? Because she saw us together?”

Guan Yu nodded. “It’s possible. We haven’t met in a long time. I’ve always claimed to be busy, yet when we finally cross paths, she finds me with another woman. Anyone in her position would feel upset.”

“I sensed it too,” Ling’er said worriedly. “The way Sister Yang looked at me felt... hostile. Do you think she resents me?”

Her current job was exceptionally favorable—light hours, ample holidays, and a high monthly salary of over seven thousand yuan plus commissions, a sum few could match.

Earning nearly ten thousand yuan a month with such ease was unimaginable elsewhere. Yet Yang Conghan’s recent coldness made Ling’er fear dismissal if jealousy took root. Still, she doubted it; Yang Conghan did not seem the petty type.

Noticing Ling’er’s anxiety, Guan Yu reassured her, “Don’t worry. This is between her and me. She won’t target you—it’s beneath her.”

He trusted Yang Conghan’s magnanimity. She wouldn’t antagonize Ling’er over their association, especially since Guan Yu had secured Ling’er the job. Any dismissal would require his consent.

“That’s a relief!” Ling’er giggled. “Brother Guan, you’re truly remarkable. The city’s most admired beauty, pursued by men from the southern gates to the northern walls, is just a meek girl in your presence!”

Guan Yu tilted his head, amused. “Since when did you learn to flatter? I don’t recall you ever speaking this way, even in jest.”

“Really? Maybe you never noticed before!” Ling’er feigned innocence.

“Little imp,” Guan Yu chuckled. “But you’re right—your Brother Guan *is* that impressive.”

Glancing toward the flower shop, he added, “Let’s go buy flowers.”

At the shop, Guan Yu selected two lavish bouquets—one for Ling’er, the other for Jinhua.

Ling’er beamed, clutching her flowers. Guan Yu shook his head, baffled by women’s fascination with blooms. To him, the wild grasses on Houyuan Temple Mountain, with their vibrant greens and delicate textures, surpassed these fragrant stems in beauty.

But Ling’er cared little. Holding the bouquet Guan Yu bought her, she radiated joy. Though she’d received flowers before—like the bouquet Hou Jinshun gave during the Flower Night Club’s reopening—this gesture felt special.

Exiting the shop, Guan Yu suggested, “Come with me to Jinhua’s tonight. We’ll have dinner together.”

Ling’er hesitated. Though eager to spend time with him, she knew Guan Yu and Jinhua, secret lovers long separated, deserved privacy. “I’ll head home. I eat little at night anyway,” she declined tactfully.

Guan Yu had anticipated this. Bringing Ling’er would provoke Jinhua’s wrath—a risk he avoided by relying on Ling’er’s discretion.

“Why eat so little?” he asked.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-Five: So Ugly**

“To lose weight, obviously!” Ling’er exclaimed. “Eating at night makes you fat!”

“You’re already skin and bones! You need gains, not cuts.” Guan Yu exaggerated, though Ling’er’s figure was ideal—maintained through disciplined eating, unlike Jinhua and Zhang Han, who devoured endlessly without gaining.

“If I don’t control myself, I’ll bloat up in days!” Ling’er shuddered. “A belly full of flab... how hideous!”

As they walked, Guan Yu escorted her home. “I won’t invite you in,” Ling’er said. “Hurry to Jinhua—she’s missed you terribly.”

Her thoughtfulness, always prioritizing others, was why Guan Yu valued her.

At Jinhua’s building, Guan Yu’s phone rang—Pan Taisheng calling.

“How’s Old Sun?” Guan Yu asked.

“In surgery. The X-ray showed pelvic fractures, but recovery’s possible with care. Any progress on your end?”

“Resolved. The inspector’s arrested, and compensation will come. He’ll pay for his cruelty.”

“Damn right! I’d have beaten him dead if you hadn’t stopped me!”

“Justice is served. He’ll never harass you again.”

After discussing Qi Zhi—a suspicious tenant Pan couldn’t recall—Guan Yu hung up and knocked on Jinhua’s door. No answer.

As he pondered, the elevator dinged. A middle-aged woman emerged, startling him until she spoke—Jinhua’s voice unmistakable beneath the disguise.

“You worried?” she teased, laden with grocery bags. “I stockpiled since someone forbade me from going out!”

Inside, Jinhua gleefully arranged the roses Guan Yu brought while he eyed her snacks. “You’ll gain weight eating all that!”

“Unlike your stick-figured girls, I stay slim!” She tossed off her disguise, revealing her fair complexion.

Discussing the golden dagger’s talismans, Jinhua theorized, “Your cultivation wasn’t destroyed—it’s sealed alongside your memories. Deciphering these runes could free both.”

Guan Yu sighed. “A useless hunk of gold until then.”

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-Six: Unchanged**

Jinhua brandished the unaltered dagger. “Patience. Once I crack these symbols, everything returns.”

Guan Yu mused, “Yingzi said I entrusted this to her, promising to reclaim it. I don’t remember, but she cherished it like a piece of me.”

“She had no reason to lie,” Jinhua said. “And the runes’ clarity proves she protected it well.”

“Clarity means nothing if we’re clueless.”

Jinhua smirked. “Then I’ll study harder. Now—” She tugged his hand. “Enough talk. You owe me months of company!”
