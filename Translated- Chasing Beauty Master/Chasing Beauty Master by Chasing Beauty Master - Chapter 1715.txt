“Senior Brother Ling Su.” Aze stepped forward, raising his voice against the howling wind. “This mission was ordered by the Sect Master himself. We must complete it without fail. Yet your actions have baffled us all. Why would you harm us? What is your purpose?”

“Purpose?” Ling Su sneered. “I’m not targeting everyone—only Guan Yu. This matter concerns no one else. As the team leader, Guan Yu disgusts me. I merely wish to make trouble for him. That’s all.”

“Fortunately, I uncovered your treacherous intentions,” Guan Yu said coolly. “You think you can disrupt me? A pipe dream. Go train for a few more years before trying again.”

Guan Yu waved dismissively, signaling Ling Su to leave. “From this moment onward, I don’t want to see you during this mission. If I catch sight of you again, I won’t let you off so lightly. If you value your life, scram—now. The farther, the better.”

Guan Yu’s harsh tone startled many fellow disciples. Some thought him overly severe—after all, only a camel had died. Was such drastic punishment necessary?

Moreover, Ling Su had always been untouchable. Yet Guan Yu had openly humiliated him. No one knew how Ling Su would retaliate.

Ling Su pointed at Guan Yu, acutely aware of his own inferior strength. The current Guan Yu wielded numerous magical artifacts—even the Imperial Seal alone was beyond Ling Su’s ability to counter. Provoking him now would be folly.

“Guan Yu, remember this—you’re the one driving me away today. Don’t regret it. I’ll settle this debt with you in time.” Ling Su gritted his teeth before turning and striding into the desert.

Alone in the sands, survival would be arduous—especially without a tent or camel. Yet as a cultivator of considerable skill, he could rely on spiritual energy to endure.

Instead of retreating, Ling Su pressed deeper into the desert. He recalled a mysterious black pillar spotted earlier and resolved to investigate. Once an opportunity arose, he’d return to sabotage Guan Yu’s efforts.

**Chapter 4486: Departure**

Ling Su refused to believe Guan Yu could maintain constant vigilance. The moment guard slipped, he’d stealthily return—slaughtering camels and burning tents. Previously, he’d acted openly. Now expelled, he’d operate in shadows, ensuring Guan Yu knew no peace.

After Ling Su’s departure, Guan Yu approached the dead camel and sighed. He’d anticipated Ling Su might cause trouble in the desert—still resentful over Siqi—but targeting the camel first enraged him.

“Finish preparations and rest early,” Guan Yu instructed. “From now on, act as if Ling Su never existed.”

Inside the tent, Siqi fretted, “Guan Yu, Ling Su headed deeper into the desert. Expelling him risks grave danger. What if something happens?”

Raised in the Cloud Azure Sect, Siqi valued camaraderie. Though appalled by Ling Su’s actions, she still pleaded for him.

“If he dares reappear,” Guan Yu said coldly, “I’ll show no mercy. I spared him once for old ties. Next time, death awaits. If he’s wise, he’ll flee this place.”

“But he’s the Sect Master’s favored disciple,” Siqi persisted. “What if he perishes here? The Sect Master…”

Guan Yu scoffed. “I spare no leniency for enemies. This was his only chance. If he lingers to plot against me, I’ll eliminate him—even if it means expulsion from the Cloud Azure Sect. Such consequences mean little to me.”

Siqi fell silent, torn between anger at Ling Su’s betrayal and lingering affection for a longtime brother. She prayed he’d retreat to the sect and abandon further strife.

Many disciples resented Guan Yu’s harshness—particularly Ling Su’s allies. They deemed a camel’s death insufficient cause for exile. Upon their return, they expected Sect Master Xuan Ming to censure Guan Yu.

Others, long oppressed by Ling Su’s arrogance, rejoiced inwardly. Freed from his bullying and extortion, they relished the prospect of peace.

Regardless, events had unfolded. With Lin Chen earlier abandoned at an inn and Ling Su now exiled—Xuan Ming’s two prized disciples neutralized—some speculated Guan Yu aimed to usurp their positions by sabotaging the mission.

If the mission failed, Guan Yu could blame Lin Chen and Ling Su. If successful, he’d claim sole credit, ascending the sect’s ranks.

Many dismissed Guan Yu as an upstart relying on powerful artifacts. They doubted his ability to challenge entrenched rivals like Lin Chen and Ling Su.

Unconcerned with others’ opinions, Guan Yu focused on the task. Those who opposed him could voice complaints—or leave.

Though Aze supported Guan Yu, he worried for Ling Su’s survival in the harsh desert. Yet with the mission paramount, he shelved his concerns. Ling Su’s cultivation prowess should suffice.

**Chapter 4487: Inner Thoughts**

Ling Su trudged onward, guided by the black pillar glimpsed earlier. Dawn’s approach revealed it as a towering structure—possibly inhabited.

Closer inspection showed it wasn’t a pillar but a square wooden edifice over ten meters tall, surrounded by yurts arranged in three orderly rows.

Exhausted from trudging through sand, Ling Su lamented lacking a camel. Now understanding Guan Yu’s prioritization of the beasts, he pressed toward the structure.

The compound’s scale impressed him—transporting materials here demanded immense effort. Deep foundations would be necessary to withstand desert storms.

As sunlight intensified, Ling Su hastened. Without water or shade, dehydration loomed. Reaching the yurts, he noted hardened paths between them—signs of habitation.

Approaching a peripheral yurt, he called, “Is anyone here?” and entered without response.

Inside, the spacious yurt smelled of milk and feminine belongings. A screen partitioned the room. Hearing movement, Ling Su rounded it to find a disheveled young woman clutching her garments.

Her disheveled hair and sleepy eyes couldn’t mask her striking beauty. Ling Su felt an immediate allure—her gaze almost hypnotic.

“Who are you?” she demanded, eyeing his unfamiliar attire.

**Chapter 4488: Tranquility**

Ling Su’s gaze swept the yurt’s interior—thick-layered hides insulated against wind, wooden frames supporting the structure. This was no ordinary settlement.

“I mean no harm,” Ling Su said, feigning courtesy. “I seek water and food. May I trouble you for assistance?”

The woman studied him warily. “You’re not from the clans. Why venture here?”

“I’m… lost,” Ling Su lied. “Separated from my caravan. Please—a drink?”

Her eyes narrowed, but she gestured toward a water vessel. As Ling Su drank greedily, schemes brewed in his mind. This place could serve as a hideout to monitor Guan Yu’s group.

Beyond survival, revenge burned bright. Visions of Guan Yu’s demise fueled him—flaying his skin, pulling tendons, savoring every scream. And Siqi… she’d finally be his.

After replenishing, Ling Su excused himself to “explore further,” though his true aim was reconnaissance. The black tower’s purpose intrigued him—perhaps a watchtower or ritual site?

Circling the compound, he noted armed guards patrolling. These weren’t mere nomads. Stealth became paramount—he’d need to blend in until Guan Yu’s team arrived.

Finding an unoccupied yurt, Ling Su appropriated a cloak and headscarf. Disguised, he melted into the settlement’s rhythms, biding time until chaos could be sown.

Somewhere in the desert, Guan Yu’s group advanced. Ling Su smiled. Let them come. When they did, he’d be ready—a viper in the sands.
