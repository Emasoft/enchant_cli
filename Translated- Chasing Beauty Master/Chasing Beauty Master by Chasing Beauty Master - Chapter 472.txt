“Twenty seconds. Heh, interesting. Jingang (Golden Vajra), are those the Blood Asura’s weaknesses you mentioned?” Guan Yu’s hands wove intricate seals as a terrifying aura brewed within him.

“Ten, nine, eight, seven...”

“Enough counting! Watch this—Nanming Lihuo’s Vermilion Bird Seal!” Guan Yu’s face twisted grotesquely as he felt his spiritual energy being rapidly drained.

Cobalt flames coalesced into the form of a Vermilion Bird that let out a piercing cry before exploding violently. Within a twenty-meter radius, everything became engulfed in azure-purple fire.

“Kekeke... An amusing junior! Nanming Lihuo (Southern Brightness Departing Fire)?” The dispersed blood shadows recoiled as if seeing a ghost, rapidly coalescing into a humanoid form that gradually solidified into a man.

“A mere three-thousand-year-old Asura avatar dares act so arrogantly? Guan Yu, lend me your body—no, let me take control for three minutes. I’ll slaughter this wretch.” In Guan Yu’s consciousness sea, Jingang (Golden Vajra) stomped furiously, clearly incensed by the disrespect. Though Guan Yu’s attack looked impressive, it hadn’t harmed the enemy’s core.

“How?” Guan Yu inhaled deeply. Though this space existed independently from their world, its stability and spiritual density far surpassed anything he’d known—evident from his accelerated energy recovery. He popped a pill into his mouth while warily eyeing the red-haired middle-aged man nearby.

“Close your eyes, empty your mind, and enter your consciousness sea.” Jingang’s voice turned ice-cold. This soul-overriding method would never be used except in life-or-death situations.

* * *

“Hah... Having a physical form feels splendid.” When the eyes reopened—now belonging to Jingang rather than Guan Yu—they revealed mild surprise at the seamless transition.

“Panting already after that little display, boy? Fresh blood... How many years has it been?” The Asura licked crimson lips with a scarlet tongue, staring at Guan Yu and Zhang Ziran like a starving man eyeing bread.

“Brother Zhang, rest. I’ll handle this.” Jingang’s eyes narrowed as he appeared behind Zhang Ziran. A precise chop neutralized the swirling purple talismans around him, the exact force knocking Zhang unconscious.

“Hmm? You’re not that brat... No matter. I’ll feast regardless!” The Blood Asura split into countless blood shadows swarming toward Guan Yu, driven by primal hunger.

“Ha! A Nascent Soul-stage runt daring to posture before me? Let’s educate you.” Jingang flicked a finger, releasing a purple-blue spark that exploded into a colossal net ensnaring all blood shadows.

“Damnation! Who are—ARGH—!”

The contracting net compressed the shrieking Asura into a basketball-sized sphere. Nanming Lihuo crackled as it purified the entity, eliciting sizzling screams.

“Time’s short. Choose: submit or perish.” No trace of Jingang’s former levity remained. Cradling the flaming orb, he exuded sovereign authority that dominated heaven and earth.

“You think I’d—ARGH!” The proud Asura’s defiance died as flames constricted viciously, eliciting steam-like shrieks.

“Names mean nothing. Since you’re stubborn, I’ll refine you into nourishment.” Jingang’s eyes hardened as flames intensified, his right hand secretly clutching a low-grade spirit stone.

“NO! I submit! I SUBMIT!” The Asura’s survival instinct overrode pride. Jingang exhaled inwardly—taming this entity would prove invaluable.

“Then offer your Blood Core space and soul essence.” Mere verbal submission wouldn’t suffice. Safeguards were essential.

“What? How do you—Very well!” Shock flashed as the Asura complied. Its Blood Core—a crimson particle akin to a human heart—and soul essence materializing as a frail blood infant near collapse received golden suppression sigils and wisps of azure flame.

* * *

“Now that you’re subdued, explain this place. More than just a tomb, isn’t it?” Regaining control, Guan Yu watched the flaming sphere dissipate. The reappearing Asura now appeared gaunt and weakened.

“Boy, this pl—ARGH!” Soul-searing agony dropped the creature writhing like Sun Wukong under the golden headband.

“Address me as Master. Henceforth, you’re my servant. Remember your place.” Guan Yu stared dispassionately at the convulsing Asura.

**Chapter 1195: Graveyard of Corpses**

“Understood... Master...” All defiance evaporated. Survival instinct crushed remaining arrogance.

“You need a name. ‘Old Blood’ suffices. Now describe this space.” Guan Yu waited calmly. Wandering blindly while Zhang remained unconscious invited disaster.

“Master, I’ve not fully explored this realm. That damned Daoist trapped me here long ago. It’s a burial ground—not vast. We broke the plain’s restrictions. The valley yonder remains unexplored.” The subdued Asura—now Lao Xue (Old Blood)—spilled everything.

“Formations? Seems my friend hid truths. Lao Xue, guard the perimeter. Alert me to intruders.” Guan Yu decided to revive Zhang first for explanations.

* * *

“Ugh! Guan Yu, why strike me?” Zhang’s immediate质问 pleased Guan Yu—it signaled trust.

“Some matters are best unknown. The Blood Asura’s tamed but ignorant of this place. You summoned me to break formations—where are they?” Guan Yu asked pointedly, accepting mutual secrecy.

“This isn’t my ancestor’s tomb but an ancient sect’s reincarnation ground housing countless cultivation remains. My granduncle discovered it but fell to Asura ambush while returning. The key only admits two Golden Core cultivators. I seek Dragon-Tiger Mountain relics from the valley’s outskirts.” Zhang sighed, ashamed of deception.

“Enough chatter. Let’s move.” Eager to conclude affairs in this perilous ancient graveyard, Guan Yu urged forward.

* * *

Sprinting across plains, they soon discovered flight capability. Soaring exhilaration ended abruptly at a formation barrier near the valley.

“Here? Wait—Lao Xue returns.” Guan Yu sensed his servant’s approach through their soul link.

The bedraggled Asura descended hastily. “Two youths tried entering—one wielded Thunder God’s Pearls. Enemies, Master?”

“Obviously. Leave them. Focus on breaking this formation.” Guan Yu consulted Jingang mentally.

“Simple. Let Sister Liu handle this. Master, head northwest—I sense something vital there.” Jingang delegated to Liu Shilei while urging Guan Yu onward.

* * *

“HAHAHA! The Heaven-Piercer is mine! Henceforth, the Three Sacred Sects shall bow to my Demonic God Cult!” A maddened roar echoed ahead.

“Ren Qiansha? What’s he—?” Guan Yu froze as apocalyptic black energy descended like vengeful gods.

“DEMONIC GOD DESCENSION! Hurl my true form there—NOW!” Jingang’s unprecedented urgency made Guan Yu fling the black staff with all strength before charging forward.

“GUAN YU! STOP HIM FROM SUMMONING THAT ABOMINATION OR WE DIE!” Qiantian’s desperate shout greeted their arrival at a nightmarish scene—a massive formation spewing undead hordes while two winged azure wolves assaulted the struggling cultivator.

“Destroy the array! Each take a wolf! If that summoning completes, we’re finished!” Qiantian roared, pulverizing a zombie.

“Done!” Seven violet swords materialized above Guan Yu, stabbing downward in Big Dipper formation. Purple light shattered the array, ceasing the undead tide.

“What’re these?” Guan Yu brandished his sword at the frost wolves.

“Glacial Howlers—weak to fire!” Qiantian summoned a massive hammer.

“Vermilion Bird Fire Rain!” Countless flame sparrows streaked toward the beasts.

“Four Symbols Sword Dance—VERMILION BIRD!” Guan Yu’s blade merged with a colossal fire avian. A flash later, the bisected wolf halves thudded to the ground.

**Chapter 1196: Demonic God’s Descent**

“HAHAHA! So-called righteous geniuses can’t stop me! Demonic God—DESCEND!” Ren Qiansha knelt worshipfully as a black vortex tore the sky.

*BOOM*

A colossal hand emerged, space fracturing like glass around it.

“Surrender now, and I’ll make your deaths quick!” Ren gloated behind an impenetrable gray barrier as Guan Yu’s sword and Qiantian’s hammer rebounded uselessly.

“Nine-Word Mantra: Divine Soldier Manifestation—EVIL PURGE!” A golden dragon aura enveloped Guan Yu’s blade as it shot toward Ren.

“INSECTS DARE CHALLENGE A GOD?” The emerging titan flicked the sword away contemptuously. Guan Yu crashed into Qiantian, coughing blood.

“Lungs... burning... Beware miasma...” Guan Yu wheezed, suppressing invasive demonic energy.

“Can you use that immortal artifact?” Qiantian eyed the fully manifested Demonic God in despair.

“HEY! HURRY UP!” Guan Yu shouted into the void.

“Your women—I’ll cherish them thoroughly!” Ren’s manic laughter accompanied the Demonic God’s slowly descending fist.

“KILLING MY MASTER REQUIRES MY PERMISSION!” A familiar mocking voice rang out.

*CRASH*

A colossal black staff shattered the demonic fist. Jingang materialized protectively before the fallen duo.

“Cutting it close!” Guan Yu exhaled shakily—the fist had nearly crushed them.

“Would I miss your funeral?” Jingang grinned, staff gleaming with primordial power.
