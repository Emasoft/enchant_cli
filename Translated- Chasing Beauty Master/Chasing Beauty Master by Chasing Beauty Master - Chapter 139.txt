As the commotion over there settled down, Guan Yu slowly turned back to his seat.

Niu Le, who had been stuffing his face all this time, cheeks bulging like a squirrel's, mumbled through mouthfuls: "Fuck, being a celebrity's exhausting! Still gotta play drinking buddy! Big Bro, tell Gao Wei to quit this shit! Not worth the hassle!"

Guan Yu shot him an amused glance. "What's that got to do with me?"

"Everything! She'd listen to you, right?" Niu Le declared with utter conviction, as if stating universal truth.

Chuckling, Guan Yu shook his head helplessly. This superstar woman was merely a nodding acquaintance through Du Xiaojuan's connection. Though their meeting had some... interesting twists, they could barely be considered friends! Since when did her affairs become his responsibility?

Just as Guan Yu prepared to leave after Niu Le finished gorging himself, the director's table erupted in boisterous laughter. Xu Dalong and his entrepreneur friends were clearly enjoying themselves, their merriment reaching new heights.

Yet Xu Dalong's eyes kept drifting toward Gao Wei like compass needles finding north. This lotus-pure beauty stirred primal desires in any red-blooded man – those phoenix eyes, that jade-carved face begging to be cradled and cherished. Flushed with pleasure from Piao Xu and the director's flattery, Xu Dalong suddenly clapped his hands.

"Though not part of the crew," he announced grandiosely, "allow me to say a few words!" Rising with theatrical flair, the hotel tycoon relished this chance to preen before Gao Wei and other beauties. His investment in this film wasn't just for advertisements – it was a stage for his peacock strut.

Chapter 341: The Paupers

Xu Dalong cleared his throat, assuming benevolent benefactor airs. The banquet hall fell silent as crew members paused mid-bite.

"I am the proprietor of this establishment," he orated, voice swelling with false modesty. "Old friends with Director Feng here! For our honored guests filming in N City, I guarantee—"

His magnanimous speech shattered when Niu Le spat half-chewed fish onto the table. "Fuck me! This fish is rancid! Tastes like vinegar! Y'all taste that?"

The abrupt outburst echoed through the silent hall. Oblivious, Niu Le turned to Guan Yu: "Try the meatballs though! Damn good. Why ain't you eating more?"

Xu Dalong's face darkened. Piao Xu sneered: "Ignore those paupers. Starving country bumpkins. Disgraceful."

"Fuck you say?!" Niu Le roared, veins bulging. Guan Yu restrained him with a hand on his shoulder. "Let's go."

"Fuckers called us poor trash!" Niu Le fumed, stomping like an enraged bull. Only Guan Yu's grip prevented him from smashing a bottle over Piao Xu's head.

Piao Xu's mocking laughter followed them: "Next time there's leftovers, I'll call you paupers!"

As they reached the elevators, Xu Dalong intercepted them. "Take the stairs! You're blocking the way!"

When they ignored him, elevator doors opened to reveal Xu Bin – local mafia boss – who brightened upon seeing Guan Yu. "Brother Guan! What fortune!" Their warm handshake and camaraderie left Xu Dalong gaping.

Chapter 342: Untouchable

After Guan Yu left, Xu Bin wheeled on his cousin: "You nearly messed with him? That man's untouchable! Next time he comes, everything's free. Understand?"

The revelation left the banquet crowd murmuring. Gao Wei watched the exchange with newfound interest, while Piao Xu's sneer faltered.

Next day on set, the atmosphere shifted. Crew members stopped ordering Guan Yu and Niu Le around. The duo wandered freely, cracking jokes with technicians until they found themselves in Gao Wei's dressing room.

"Scram! This is my space!" Piao Xu stormed in, livid at finding them bantering with his crush.

Guan Yu rose slowly, cracking his knuckles. "Say that again?"

Piao Xu backpedaled as Gao Wei intervened. "Enough! Guan Yu, out!"

Chapter 343: Do Me a Favor

Later, during filming breaks, Guan Yu lounged against Gao Wei's makeup table. "Admit it – you'll miss my charming company."

"Charming?" She snorted. "More like street thug charisma. Perfect for playing traitors or bandits."

Their laughter died when Piao Xu reappeared, face purple with rage. "Get your filthy feet off my station!"

Guan Yu stood nose-to-nose with him: "Wanna repeat that?"

As security moved in, Gao Wei's phone recorded everything – including Piao Xu's eventual retreat, humiliated yet again. The dressing room incident became set legend, cementing Guan Yu's reputation as the crew's uncrowned king.
