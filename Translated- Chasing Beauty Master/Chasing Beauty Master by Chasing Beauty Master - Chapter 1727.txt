**Chapter 4518: A Good Child**

The Jia Yi Sect seized this opportune moment to descend upon the Ha Clan with their followers. They burned, slaughtered, and plundered. The remaining clan members stood no chance against the sect’s overwhelming forces. By midday, the Jia Yi Sect had stripped the Ha Clan bare.

Ling Su, sensing danger, fled swiftly to avoid entanglement in the chaos.

Finally, the Jia Yi Sect pressed forward to the wooden tower, capturing the elder chief. Their leader demanded, **“I have but one purpose here: hand over your clan’s mysterious secret manual, and the rest of your people shall be spared. Observe your subjects—I will execute them one by one at intervals until you comply.”**

**“Delusions!”** The elder chief retorted, trembling with rage. **“Even if you slaughter every last soul here, I will never surrender this manual. Moreover, our clan possesses no such secret! These are mere rumors!”**

**“Hmph! You vermin, steeped in atrocities, shall reap what you’ve sown. Even in death, I’ll never yield it to you!”** The sect leader, unswayed, waved a hand dismissively.

In truth, the elder chief knew nothing of any manual. The origins of this claim were murky, and he remained unaware of Ma Zhagen’s current plight.

**“Your clan has long opposed us. Do not mistake the Jia Yi Sect for fools. Today, I take you captive to extract this secret,”** declared the sect leader, his serpent-masked visage gleaming coldly.

The Ha Clan’s men were slaughtered, while women and the elder chief were taken hostage. When Ma Zhagen returned, he found his homeland razed, its vibrant people reduced to corpses.

The missing—including the elder chief—were either captured or had fled. Ma Zhagen seethed, realizing the sect had lured him away with an empty fort strategy. **“Jia Yi Sect! I will make you repay blood debts with blood!”** The rift between the Ha Clan and the sect deepened irreparably.

Ma Zhagen regrouped his forces, burying the dead and fortifying the wooden tower. Though battered, the clan’s elite fighters remained intact. Resolved to fight to the death, Ma Zhagen vowed to track the sect’s movements and strike.

Hadabei, however, grew restless. His wife and children were absent among the dead, granting him fleeting relief. **“Zhagen,”** he urged, **“the sect seeks this manual. We must rescue the captives before more suffer. Their cruelty knows no bounds!”**

**“I share your urgency,”** Ma Zhagen replied, **“but I know nothing of this manual. Even if it existed, where would I find it?”**

**“Did the elder chief never hint at its location?”** Hadabei pressed. **“Let us search. Perhaps we can trade it for their lives.”**

Ma Zhagen eyed him warily. **“Hadabei, your concern is commendable, but this ‘manual’ is a pretext. The sect seeks to destroy us.”**

Unbeknownst to Ma Zhagen, Hadabei had struck a deal with the sect leader—spare his family, and he would secure the manual. Yet Ma Zhagen’s ignorance seemed genuine.

That night, Hadabei slipped away to a newly established sect outpost. The masked leader questioned him: **“What of the Ha Clan? Any trace of the manual?”**

**“None. Ma Zhagen is clueless. I swear it,”** Hadabei replied. **“Now, where are my family?”**

The sect leader dismissed his followers and removed her mask, revealing a stunningly beautiful face—a young woman with mesmerizing eyes. **“Do you care only for your family, not me?”** She embraced him. **“Am I lesser than your aging wife? Tell me—who holds your heart?”**

Flustered, Hadabei stammered, **“You… of course it’s you. But she and I… there’s history—”**

**“Silence!”** she interjected. **“If you cling to them, I’ll have them killed. You belong to me alone.”**

Seduced, Hadabei abandoned all thought of his family. The leader ordered him to extract the manual’s location from the elder chief, promising freedom in exchange.

At the prison, captives initially rejoiced at Hadabei’s arrival. His wife cried, **“You’ve come to save us!”** Their son pleaded, **“Father, I’m hungry!”**

Hadabei’s resolve wavered momentarily. **“Good child… you’ll be safe,”** he murmured, stroking the boy’s hair before addressing the elder chief. **“Surrender the manual, and all live.”**

**“Traitor!”** the chief spat. **“The Ha Clan disowns you! Our fate is none of your concern!”**

Enraged by the chief’s defiance, Hadabei snapped, **“You stubborn fool! Each day you delay, another dies. How long will you cling to lies?”**

His wife wept, **“Have you forsaken our beliefs?”**

Hadabei coldly compared her to the sect leader’s allure. **“I do this to survive. Hand over the manual, or watch your people perish.”**

When the chief remained silent, Hadabei ordered an execution. A prisoner begged, **“Chief, give them what they want! Must we all die for nothing?”**

The chief sighed. **“I swear—no manual exists. These are baseless accusations. If they return tomorrow, I’ll offer myself first.”**

---

Returning to the Ha Clan’s tower, Hadabei was intercepted by Ma Zhagen. **“Where have you been?”**

**“I needed air,”** Hadabei lied. **“The sect demands the manual, yet we’re powerless—”**

**“You went to them,”** Ma Zhagen accused. **“Their timed attack reeks of insider aid. You returned unharmed, well-fed—a traitor’s luxury.”**

Hadabei feigned innocence. **“You wrong me! I urge the manual’s surrender to save lives!”**

**“Liar!”** Ma Zhagen countered. **“Your obsession with the manual betrays you. Why push this fiction unless you serve them?”**

**Chapter 4519: Exposed**

Hadabei’s facade crumbled. Ma Zhagen pressed, **“The sect knew our plans. You leaked them. Admit it!”**

**“This is madness!”** Hadabei protested, but panic flickered in his eyes.

Ma Zhagen’s voice turned icy. **“You returned unscathed, your loyalty eroded. The chief’s favoritism toward me gnawed at you, didn’t it? Now you’d sell our clan for a woman’s lies.”**

Hadabei backed away, realizing escape was his only option. But Ma Zhagen’s men blocked the exits. The truth, like a drawn blade, left no room for denial.
