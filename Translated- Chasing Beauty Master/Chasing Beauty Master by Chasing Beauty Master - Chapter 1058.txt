“Bi Erlin and Fang Su followed along as well. With nothing else to do, they figured playing a few rounds wouldn’t hurt. From afar, Fang Su spotted a beautiful dealer shaking dice and remarked, “I’ll go play some dice. Simple enough—won’t strain the brain.”

Bi Erlin chuckled, “You’ve got your eye on that pretty dealer, haven’t you? Stop pretending with me. Let’s go—I’ll join you for some fun too.”

Fang Su shot him a disdainful look. “Damn, so you’re after the same thing.”

Bi Erlin whispered slyly, “Didn’t you have that girl at home? Not satisfying enough? Looking to spice things up?”

Fang Su knew he meant Liu Chan—now essentially his father’s plaything. Having lost interest in her himself, he was naturally seeking fresh prey. “What man doesn’t want variety? Home-cooked meals can’t compete with forbidden fruit,” Fang Su replied breezily.

“Hah! True enough. Let’s go charm that little beauty,” Bi Erlin said, brightening. “Since we’re both interested, how about a fair competition? Whoever she picks gets her. No interference. Deal?”

Fang Su lifted his chin arrogantly. “Deal.” Though less wealthy than Bi Erlin, Fang Su prided himself on his pretty-boy looks. Bi Erlin’s mixed Western features, he reasoned, would pale against his own classic Eastern charm when vying for a clearly Chinese woman’s attention.

The gaming floor buzzed with activity, but the dice table drew the largest crowd. Two factors explained its popularity: the simplicity of betting “Big” or “Small,” and the stunningly tall, slender dealer whose smile had every man orbiting her station.

After shoving through the throng, Fang Su perked up at the sight of the dealer. Noticing most bets piled on “Small,” he recklessly tossed his entire stack onto “Big” and boomed, “All on Big! If I win, you’re spending the night with me, sweetheart. My word’s gold—you won’t regret it!”

Up close, the dealer’s porcelain skin and delicate features confirmed her allure. While Bi Erlin hesitated over his chips, Fang Su’s bravado hung in the air.

Bi Erlin opted to observe first. If “Small” hit, Fang Su would be wiped out. If “Big” won, he’d still have chips for another round. The dealer lifted the dice cup with practiced grace, her flawless Mandarin announcing, “Bets closed. Rolling now.”

As the cup arced through the air, three dice clattered inside. Cheers of “Big!” and “Small!” erupted. Fang Su’s shouts of “Big! Big! Big!” mingled with stolen glances at the dealer’s unreadable smile.

The cup slammed down. Tension crackled. Bi Erlin’s lips moved silently, willing an outcome that would crush all bets: “Triple… Triple…”

The cup lifted. Three ones stared back—a Triple. The crowd groaned. Fang Su gaped at the dice, disbelief etched on his face. “Bullshit! Rigged!” a losing player spat before storming off.

“Apologies, gentlemen. Triple—house takes all,” the dealer demurred, sweeping the chips away with a rake.

Bi Erlin struggled to contain his glee. Not only was Fang Su busted, but departing players thinned the competition. “Think, you idiot!” he mocked. “Casinos don’t let outsiders win. When bets balance, the house plays Triple. Obvious!”

Fang Su glared at Bi Erlin’s remaining chips. “Loan me some. I’ll pay you back—win or lose.”

“Our deal was chips-only. You’re out.” Bi Erlin hugged his stack protectively. “Enjoy the view.”

Undeterred, Fang Su turned to the dealer. “Beautiful, got plans tonight?”

“Sir,” she replied smoothly, “please refrain from personal questions during work hours.”

Bi Erlin snorted. “No class, as usual.”

As the next round began, Fang Su spitefully rooted against Bi Erlin’s “Big” bet. Their rivalry crescendoed with each shake of the cup—until factory whistles blew elsewhere, unnoticed.

Miles away, workers streamed from Yu Gang’s newly acquired leather factory. In the cafeteria, upgraded meals boosted morale. “Never ate this good under Sun Xu!” a worker marveled.

“Yu Gang takes care of its own,” boasted Mei Ren, a veteran member. Two newcomers slid beside him.

“Mind if we join?” asked the sharper-dressed one. “We’re new—heard great things about Yu Gang.”

Mei Ren eyed them. “What’s your background?”

Before they could answer, night shift alarms blared. Wang Hu, the factory’s newly appointed head, scanned the perimeter. Though Sun Xu’s old cronies posed little threat now, vigilance remained key. With Blue Boss securing small orders and workers training on machines, stability was fragile.

The newcomers exchanged glances. Their mission—whether to infiltrate or observe—hung unspoken in the air thick with the scent of fresh leather and simmering ambition.
