“Actually, I’d love to keep listening to Dao Yi’s nonsense. Honestly, things have been tense lately – this makes for a good distraction.”

Zhou Xiaochuan glared fiercely at Zhou Tianci. “Apologies, Xiao Yu. This unfilial son has made us all look like fools!”

Guan Yu smiled. “Don’t blame Uncle Zhou. He’s just worried about your granddaughter.”

Zhou Tianci had indeed acted out of desperation by seeking Dao Yi’s help. Yet he remained distrustful of Guan Yu. What could this college student – still wet behind the ears – possibly achieve where even the finest doctors in the capital had failed?

“Come, Xiao Yu. Let’s check on Xiaoyou.”

**Chapter 1097: Zhou Xiaoyou**

Following Zhou Xiaochuan, Guan Yu entered a cramped windowless room draped in black cloth. A sliver of daylight through the doorway revealed a pale girl huddled trembling on a narrow bed, comforted by a middle-aged woman.

This was Zhou Xiaoyou.

Guan Yu’s first thought was that her condition resembled Jiang Yiyi’s, but the girl’s vacant stare contradicted this. This wasn’t psychological – pure terror gripped her.

As Zhou Xiaoyou muttered “Go away! Don’t come near me!”, Guan Yu finally understood why Dao Yi claimed she’d encountered ghosts. Her state left little doubt.

“How is she?” Zhou Xiaochuan asked anxiously.

The mother sighed. “Same as ever – keeps babbling about seeing spirits. What evil have we invited?”

“Xiao Yu, please examine her.”

Nodding, Guan Yu approached cautiously. Before he reached the bed, Zhou Xiaoyou suddenly lunged at him with inhuman strength. He dodged effortlessly as the parents struggled to restrain their daughter.

“Mr. Guan!” Zhou Tianci snapped after subduing his daughter. “We don’t need your help. Leave!”

“Tianci!” Zhou Xiaochuan roared. “One more word and I’ll throw you out first!”

Ignoring the tension, Guan Yu darted forward and tapped Zhou Xiaoyou’s pressure point, rendering her unconscious.

“What are you doing?!” Zhou Tianci bellowed.

“Emotional instability hinders treatment,” Guan Yu calmly explained, checking her pulse. Moments later, he stood. “Let’s discuss outside.”

The family’s anxiety peaked at Guan Yu’s grave expression. “It’s hysteria – what common folk call ‘ghost possession’,” he revealed.

“But there’s more. Traces of hallucinogens in her system suggest... deliberate poisoning.”

The Zhous froze. “Who would target Xiaoyou?” Zhou Xiaochuan demanded.

“Consider recent conflicts. Any enemies?”

Zhou Tianci hesitated before confessing: “Three months ago... my son forcibly acquired a hotel. The previous owner bore an inverted crucifix tattoo...”

As realization dawned, Zhou Xiaochuan erupted: “You allowed extortion?! Find that man immediately!”

**Chapter 1098: Liu Shilei’s Reunion**

Leaving the Zhou residence, Guan Yu received Wen Qing’s call: “Husband! Where are you? Shilei’s reunion starts soon!”

Slapping his forehead, Guan Yu raced to Caesar Boulevard where his wives awaited. After enduring playful scoldings and public kisses that drew stares, the group split – others shopping while Guan Yu accompanied Liu Shilei to Aquamarine Palace.

A silver BMW screeched into the parking lot. A tall youth emerged, spotting Liu Shilei: “Shilei! It’s really you!”

Ignoring Guan Yu, Zhu Yiqun grabbed her hand. “Still as fragrant as ever!”

Liu Shilei quickly excused herself. As they passed, Guan Yu discreetly jabbed Zhu’s waist with a silver needle, sending him yelping like a scalded pig.

“Must you?” Liu Shilei chided gently.

“He deserved worse,” Guan Yu shrugged.

Inside, catty remarks began immediately. A jealous classmate sneered: “Couldn’t find a real man, so you brought your brother?”

“My husband prefers being pampered,” Liu Shilei retorted, feeding Guan Yu delicacies.

When a plump woman mocked him as a “kept man”, Guan Yu fired back: “At least I’m keepable. Who’d want your greasy self even with a billion?”

As the insulted woman stormed off, male suitors pounced: “A real man shouldn’t live off women!”

Liu Shilei wiped Guan Yu’s lips tenderly. “My man does as he pleases. I’ll support him always.”
