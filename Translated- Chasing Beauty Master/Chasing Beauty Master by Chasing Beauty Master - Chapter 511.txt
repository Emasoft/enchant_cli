“If that weren’t the case, how could they possibly stay together every day? Amy also loves being with the person she likes every day! Dragon Clan brother, what about you?”

Though Amy’s words were somewhat childish, they struck a deep chord within Guan Yu’s heart. While he aspired to dominate the world, his truest desire was to live peacefully with his beloved, far from strife and chaos. Yet this remained a mere fantasy. As the saying goes, “Ideals are plump, reality is bony.” Life’s disappointments outnumbered its joys. Even now, Guan Yu couldn’t predict his fate, let alone promise happiness to anyone. All he could do was strive silently, knowing every effort brought him closer to future success.

Lost in thought, Guan Yu unconsciously hummed a song familiar from another world:
“Darling, fly slowly, beware the roses with thorns ahead. Darling, open your mouth, the floral scent in the wind will intoxicate you…”

“Wow! Dragon Clan brother, you’re amazing! Such a beautiful song! Amy loves it!”

Seeing Amy’s adoring expression, Guan Yu mused inwardly: *Has this girl never heard anyone sing before? My croaky voice being praised? How embarrassing!*

*Clap! Clap! Clap!*
Applause sounded behind them.

Turning, they saw a debonair youth standing nearby. “What refined elegance! A talented scholar, a fair lady, splendid scenery, and moving music—truly beyond words!”

Guan Yu observed the youth—about twenty, dressed in white robes with a Lingxu Sword at his waist, handsome features exuding proud defiance.

“You flatter us,” Guan Yu replied courteously. “I’m Guan Yu, and this is my younger sister Amy. My crude singing happened to reach your ears—how embarrassing.”

The youth smiled. “No need for modesty! I’m Huang Wensheng, son of Jian Guang City’s governor.”

“Ah, an official’s second-generation heir! What an honor!” Guan Yu quipped.

“Second-generation? What does that mean?”

Realizing the term didn’t exist here, Guan Yu explained: “It means someone whose father holds office inherits that status.”

“Fascinating! Brother Guan’s wisdom teaches me new things.”

“Please, no more praise,” Guan Yu interjected. “I’ve a peculiar habit—compliments make me nervous.”

“Brother Guan jests well.”

As the men chatted, Amy puffed her cheeks indignantly. “Are you two done? Am I invisible unless I speak?”

Both men laughed. Huang Wensheng approached theatrically: “Ah! How could I overlook such a lovely maiden here?”

“Don’t act familiar! Who’s your ‘maiden’?” Amy brandished a fist at Guan Yu. “And you! Since when am I your sister?”

**Chapter 1294: The Golden Token Auction House**

Guan Yu wasn’t worried about Amy’s sudden temper—she was like a child, easily soothed.

“Is... everything alright?” Huang Wensheng asked awkwardly.

“Watch this,” Guan Yu said, pinching Amy’s puffed cheeks. “Our beauty’s anger turns her ugly!”

When teasing failed, Huang whispered advice. Reluctantly, Guan Yu approached: “Dear Miss Amy, I’ll never call you ‘sister’ publicly again.”

Amy whirled around. “Took you long enough! I’d have told Uncle Shituo you bullied me!”

Guan Yu shot Huang an impressed look: *This guy’s a romance master, taming even unreasonable girls!*

“If you’re free,” Huang suggested, “let’s tour the gardens.”

Guan Yu glanced at Amy’s nod before agreeing. “But shouldn’t a governor’s son find such scenery mundane?”

Huang sighed. “I’d trade status for freedom. My path’s predetermined—no choices.”

“Every family has troubles,” Guan Yu countered. “You worry about paths; commoners lack roads entirely.”

“Yet you’ve achieved remarkable cultivation young. How?”

Guan Yu tensed, but Huang added: “Don’t fear—I only sense your aura’s strength rivals mine. No specifics.”

Nodding, Guan Yu conceded: “Let’s enjoy the weather instead.”

Strolling through the auction house’s gardens, they reached a crystalline lake framed by swaying trees. Beyond lay the main auction hall—crowded with elites eyeing rare pills and artifacts.

“Dragon Clan brother! So many people ahead—let’s look!” Amy’s address made Huang reassess Guan Yu: *A hidden Dragon Clan member? No wonder his magical aura’s faint...*

Guan Yu noticed the scrutiny but embraced his false identity—useful in crises.

The circular auditorium held over three thousand—testament to the Golden Token Auction House’s prestige.

“It gets livelier once bidding starts,” Huang remarked.

Guan Yu nodded, feigning nonchalance though inexperienced. Huang, believing the “Dragon Clan” excuse, found any odd behavior acceptable.

As they settled, Snow Orchid Bai—the auctioneer—appeared on stage.

“Welcome! Today’s rare pills and techniques won’t disappoint!”

Cheers erupted, though one voice called: “With Miss Bai here, who needs treasures?”

Snow Orchid giggled coquettishly. “Master Lin! Your words could keep me here all day!”

Guan Yu shivered at her saccharine tone, realizing her affections were performative.

“She’s bone-deep seductive,” Huang commented.

“Interested?”

“Gods no! She flirts with everyone—who could bear that jealousy?”

Before bidding commenced, Guan Yu spotted familiar faces—including the icy Murong Yu. *Fate crosses us again... Were it not for his sister’s sake...*

He recalled Murong Li—the gentle girl he’d once used as hostage, who’d seemed willing.

As Murong Yu sat, Snow Orchid announced: “Let the auction begin! First item: Xuan-tier Cultivation Pills enhancing elemental perception! Starting bid: 100 gold!”

Guan Yu nearly choked—now he understood Elder Shituo’s warning about poverty.

Scoffs arose: “100 gold for common pills? Scam!”

Snow Orchid retorted sweetly: “Find me ten such pills for 100 gold, then talk.”

Mock bids began—101, 111 gold—until someone shouted “150 gold!”

The crowd jeered at the show-off, but Snow Orchid closed the sale at 200 gold.

“Next item!” She unveiled a crystal-clear pill under black cloth, igniting fresh anticipation...
