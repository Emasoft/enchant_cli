Without uttering a word, the Left Envoy turned and departed, fully aware of Guan Yu's relationship with the Young Mistress. He harbored no fear of any tricks from the young man.

Shortly after the Left Envoy's departure, Xiao Zhi inquired, "Guan Yu, we still don't know where Wang Xiaorong is being held. How do we rescue her?"

"We rescue her regardless. If we don't know her location, we search until we find it," Guan Yu replied coldly, his face stern.

Xiao Zhi had never seen Guan Yu so resolute. In his memory, Guan Yu had never allowed his beloved to face such peril. This was his fault—had he not been careless, Wang Xiaorong would never have been captured. Should any harm befall her, Guan Yu would never forgive himself.

He cursed his present weakness. In his past life in Huaxia, he would have long since seized Manor Lord Lu and tortured him for answers. But now, constrained by his demonic identity and sect politics, direct action proved complicated.

Though no leads had emerged, Guan Yu remained determined to save Wang Xiaorong, even if it meant overturning every stone in Lu Manor.

Returning to his chamber to collect his thoughts, Guan Yu was interrupted by Xiao Zhi's sudden inspiration. "Why don't we disguise ourselves as Lu Manor guards? If I procure two uniforms, we can search the manor freely. What do you think?"

Guan Yu nodded. "An excellent plan. Let's proceed."

Meanwhile, Manor Lord Lu regulated his breathing, relieved his internal injuries weren't severe. Thanks to Yan Zhao and Xiao Zhi's healing, his condition had stabilized.

In a dim dungeon, Wang Xiaorong sat trembling, shackled hand and foot. The cavernous cell's only light came from a wall-mounted brazier. Stone walls surrounded her, escape impossible.

"Guan Yu, you fool! How could you not notice my abduction right outside your door? When will you save me?" she muttered, clinging to faith in his rescue.

The dungeon's stone door groaned open. Manor Lord Lu entered with guards. Wang Xiaorong turned away, masking fear with defiance.

"My dear Young Mistress," Lu crooned, "comply, and you'll remain unharmed."

She remained silent, refusing to acknowledge him.

"Resign yourself to escape," Lu continued. "This dungeon is impregnable. Cooperate, and I guarantee your safety."

"Spare your fantasies. Kill me if you dare!" she retorted, mustering courage.

"Ah, such demonic pride!" Lu sneered. "But defiance will only prolong your suffering." He motioned to a guard. "Bring writing tools."

As ink and brush were placed beside her, Lu commanded, "Write to your Demon Lord father. Demand he exchange the Blood Poison and Eight-Sided Drum Technique for your life. This is your only salvation."

Wang Xiaorong laughed mirthlessly. "You understand nothing of the Demon Lord. He spurns threats. Even if I wrote, he'd let me die and slaughter you in vengeance."

"Enough!" Lu roared, though he knew her words held truth. Years prior, when her mother had been captured by righteous sects, the Demon Lord had sacrificed his own wife rather than yield.

"Very well," Wang Xiaorong conceded, feigning cooperation. "Allow me time to compose this letter."

"One night," Lu warned. "No tricks." He departed, unaware of her stalling tactic.

At midnight, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi donned guard uniforms, navigating the chaotic manor. The Left Envoy's fiery black dragon spell had ignited multiple buildings, creating perfect diversion.

"Fire! To arms!" Chaos reigned as flames spread.

"Secure the dungeon!" Lu barked, recognizing the ruse. "Let none exploit this distraction!"

Though seething at his manor's ruin, Lu restrained himself—outmatched and injured, retaliation would wait.

Guan Yu pointed to a heavily guarded gate. "That untouched post likely holds Xiaorong."

Overpowering the guards, they descended into an underground complex. Finding a sealed stone door, they were ambushed by Lu's troops.

"Honorable disciples of Yunqing Sect," Lu mocked, emerging through parted ranks, "rescuing a demoness? How disgraceful for your sect! Seize them!"

In the narrow passage, Guan Yu fought valiantly while Xiao Zhi unleashed spells. Outnumbered, Guan Yu summoned the Imperial Seal, unleashing heaven-sent lightning that felled swathes of guards—Lu included.

Escaping the electrified carnage, the pair took refuge in a derelict chamber reeking of decay. "We've alerted the enemy without rescuing Xiaorong," Guan Yu fretted.

"We must inform Senior Brother Yan Zhao," Xiao Zhi urged. "If Lu turns the sect against us..."

"Lu wouldn't dare oppose Yunqing while feuding with Demon Soul Sect," Guan Yu reasoned. "Find Yan Zhao—he'll understand."

Outside, Yan Zhao returned to find Xiao Zhi waiting.

**Chapter 3773: Schemes Within Schemes**

Yan Zhao entered their hideout, scowling. "Was last night's inferno your doing? Flames nearly consumed me in bed!"

"The Left Envoy's work," Xiao Zhi explained. "We infiltrated to rescue the Demon Soul Sect's Young Mistress."

"Manor Lord Lu deceives us," Guan Yu interjected. "His true aim is the Blood Poison and Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Warn the sect."

Yan Zhao maintained composure. "Remain hidden. I'll handle this."

As he left, Yan Zhao pondered their recklessness. The Left Envoy's orders to rescue the Young Mistress complicated matters—Guan Yu's blunder had tightened security.

Confronting Lu, Yan Zhao feigned ignorance. "Why the reduced guard?"

"Minor disturbances," Lu lied through gritted teeth, secretly seething over Guan Yu's lightning assault.

"I pursued the Left Envoy but lost him," Yan Zhao fabricated. "Have you seen my junior brothers?"

"Perhaps they left the manor," Lu suggested, playing along.

"Let us hope they cause no trouble," Yan Zhao replied, both men masking mutual suspicion.

"Rest assured," Lu declared, "no demon shall escape my dungeon."

The chess game continued, each player guarding their true intentions behind smiles sharper than blades.
