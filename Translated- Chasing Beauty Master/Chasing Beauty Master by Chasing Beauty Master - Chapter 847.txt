In the East Tower dining room of the Feng residence, Feng Xihu entered looking travel-worn after a long day's work. Seated at the table were Patriarch Feng and Young Master Feng, the spread of dishes before them remaining largely untouched by the weary woman.

After glancing at the food, Feng Xihu declared, "I've no appetite. I'm going to bathe."

As she turned to leave, Young Master Feng set down his chopsticks. "Younger sister, eat something before you go. You've toiled all day."

"I said I'm not hungry."

"I actually have matters to discuss. Come sit." At this, Feng Xihu returned, ladled herself soup, and sat beside him. After sipping the broth, she asked, "What is it?"

"I need to mobilize company funds. Your assistance in liquidating assets would be appreciated." The Young Master's request stemmed from his renewed determination to hire elite assassins from the Tian Tuan Organization - a plan vehemently opposed by Patriarch Feng due to both exorbitant costs and uncertain outcomes.

To Young Master Feng, only First-Class Supreme assassins could eliminate Guan Yu. "Once Guan Yu dies, other matters become trivial. Money can always be regained," he insisted.

Feng Xihu scoffed, "What? Broke for women? Such petty sums require only HR approval. Why trouble me?" She resumed drinking her soup.

Leaning closer, the Young Master revealed, "I need two hundred million." The declaration nearly made Feng Xihu choke. "What could you possibly need that for?" she demanded, eyes widening.

Even as she asked, realization dawned. "Family liquidity isn't what it was. Hire your assassins if you must, but remember you've been swindled before. Can you guarantee no repeat?"

"Rest assured, sister. Last time was carelessness. This time I'll negotiate terms personally with the assassins - absolute certainty." The Young Master puffed his chest confidently.

"Two hundred million poses complications. Must you insist on Tian Tuan's premium assassins? Two First-Class Supremes?" Feng Xihu frowned.

Slamming his chopsticks down, Young Master Feng growled, "The cost pains me too, but Guan Yu must die. Only such experts ensure success."

Feng Xihu sighed deeply, exchanging glances with Patriarch Feng. Recognizing her father's tacit approval, she acquiesced, "The family fortune is yours to manage. But liquidating two hundred million requires at least a week."

"Done! After waiting this long, seven days matter little." The Young Master's excitement stemmed partly from surprise - he'd expected resistance given Feng Xihu's rumored affection for Guan Yu. Believing her compliance signaled abandonment of that attachment, he impulsively pinched her skirt hem - a habitual gesture toward women during emotional highs.

The momentary lapse proved catastrophic. As his fingers registered the fabric's texture, horror dawned. Feng Xihu erupted silently, standing to deliver a resounding slap that left his ears ringing. Before he could recover, her stiletto-clad foot launched him chair and all across the room.

**Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred and Sixty-Nine: Not Intentional**

The slap reverberated through Young Master Feng's skull as he crashed to the floor, the stiletto heel embedding in his flesh. When Feng Xihu advanced for further retribution, he scrambled to plead: "Sister! Unintentional! I beg mercy!"

Patriarch Feng intervened despite his frailty, positioning himself as human shield. "Xiao Hu, your brother meant no harm. Spare him."

Regaining composure, Feng Xihu glared daggers at her sibling. "Touch me again and I'll end you. Need funds? Then abstain from women starting today - not a penny for your debauchery!"

This edict horrified both men. For Young Master Feng, carnal pursuits were lifeblood. Even Patriarch Feng protested: "You can't starve him thus! Our family can afford two hundred million without such extremes!"

"You too, father - equal abstinence." Feng Xihu's steely gaze brooked no argument. The Patriarch paled, reliant on carnal "medicines" for vitality.

After tense negotiation, Feng Xihu relented: "Two hundred million in one month. During this period, one indulgence every ten days. Violate this, no funds." She departed without awaiting rebuttal.

Patriarch Feng admonished his son: "Must you provoke her? She controls our fortunes now!" The chastened Young Master endured the deprivation, counting days until his month-long sentence ended.

The delay granted Guan Yu valuable preparation time. Though Feng Xihu could have produced the funds in three days, she honored her word. When the month elapsed, Young Master Feng immediately contacted Tian Tuan's domestic branch.

**Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred and Seventy: Just Pay**

At a luxury hotel in City Y, Young Master Feng prepared to meet his contact at Miao Miao Elite Club. In a fourth-floor VIP suite, he found a Japanese man named Jinci Yu Lang ("Second Only to Wolf") fondling a woman.

After verifying credentials, Feng Xihu's brother stated his requirement: "Can a First-Class Supreme handle a Second-Class Supreme target?"

Jinci Yu Lang bristled. "My credentials speak. Task incomplete? Full refund."

The Young Master revealed Guan Yu's file. "My last First-Class Supreme hire failed against him."

"Impossible!" The assassin scoffed. "Unless..."

"Target had external assistance," Feng Xihu's brother clarified. Satisfied, Jinci Yu Lang accepted the down payment. "Prepare the remaining hundred million within three days."

Elated, the Young Master reveled in anticipation of Guan Yu's demise - and his impending return to carnal pleasures. But this meeting was merely his first move. As evening fell, he awaited a second assassin in another private room.

The door burst open to reveal a disheveled sixty-year-old. "You're Feng?" growled the newcomer, aura crackling with menace.
