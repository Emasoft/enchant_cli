After everyone had returned to their original positions, Xuan Ming said, "I know of your loyalty to the sect, and I trust you all. Were it not for Junior Brother Lu's insistence, I would have forgone this and directly inspected the junior disciples."

"Senior Sect Leader," Elder Lu declared loudly, "I repeat—no one receives special treatment, including ourselves. In Cloud Azure Sect, apart from you, everyone must undergo inspection."

Elder Xiang curled his lip disdainfully. "Elder Lu, aren't you being overly cautious? We old fellows have served Cloud Azure Sect for centuries. How could any of us be compromised?"

**Chapter 3815: Escape**

"I suspect no one, yet in this matter, I trust no one either," Elder Lu said, his conscience pricked. Though he'd previously believed Wang Jun's loyalty to Cloud Azure Sect was unquestionable, here he stood spouting bold claims without evidence. In truth, he'd never properly inspected Wang Jun but had relied on the man's apparent competence and shrewdness.

Elder Lu continued, "On this grave day, if all disciples must be inspected, then we—as members of Cloud Azure Sect—cannot be exceptions. Special treatment must not exist."

Elder Xiang sneered. "For days, the Sect Leader demanded our disciple rosters. Only now do we learn their purpose. Clearly, Elder Lu knew earlier. This redundant scheme must be your doing! Have you considered that while Blood Toxin victims might be exposed, Demonic Sect spies without the toxin would remain hidden? This is a waste of time!"

"Even so," Elder Lu countered, "we must act. Knowing the Demonic Sect uses Blood Toxin to control people, we must root out both infected and coerced operatives. As Cloud Azure Elders, we must persist!"

Elder Dai, the sect's sole female Elder, rarely intervened but now spoke: "I find Elder Lu's reasoning sound. Gathering everyone serves as warning—traitors among us will be found and punished. Though time-consuming, this poses no harm. Finding nothing would itself be victory."

Elder Mu added, "Let us begin swiftly. But Sect Leader, if you provide more spirit beast scales, we could assist to hasten—"

"Impossible!" Elder Lu cut in. "Only the Sect Leader's inspection holds authority. Others might show leniency."

"Elder Lu!" Elder Mu retorted. "You'd exhaust our leader? With over a thousand disciples, solo inspections take ages. Let us cross-check other peaks' disciples!"

Xuan Ming nodded. "A fair point. Yet I possess only three spirit beast scales, plus one in the Ancestral Shrine—four total. We'll use them all to accelerate the process."

Elder Lu fell silent. Cross-inspecting other peaks seemed acceptable, as no Elder would favor outsiders.

"Since we Elders are cleared," Elder Lu said, "let inspections commence with Tiger Head Peak's disciples. Sect Leader, where is Yan Zhao? Begin with him." His gaze swept the hall—Yan Zhao had vanished.

"Where is Yan Zhao?" Elder Lu roared, leaping to his feet. The crowd murmured—Yan Zhao, present moments prior, had disappeared.

Xuan Ming raised a hand. "Calm yourselves. Yan Zhao excused himself earlier for... bodily needs. He'll return shortly."

"He's fled!" Elder Lu thundered. "Men! With me!" Disciples from Front Return Peak surged to follow.

Xuan Ming waved them down, exasperated. "Junior Brother Lu, contain yourself! This baseless suspicion shames my senior disciple of decades—Tiger Head Peak's most seasoned junior elder! Your rashness—"

"Delay risks his escape!" Ignoring protests, Elder Lu stormed toward Tiger Head Peak's rear quarters with his disciples.

**Chapter 3817: Clarification**

Xuan Ming stood on the dais, amplifying his voice with spiritual energy: "Silence! Yan Zhao has truly betrayed us. I visited his chambers—ransacked, valuables gone. He fled prepared."

Elder Lu returned fuming. "Chased for leagues—no trace! He knew back paths! This was planned!"

Xuan Ming offered no rebuttal, humiliation burning—his star disciple, a Demonic Sect spy! The world seemed upended.

Elder Lu pressed, "I long suspected Yan Zhao! Elder Xiang's obstinacy gave him escape time!"

Elder Xiang bristled. "Accusing me? His bathroom break needed no my permission! Blame the Sect Leader!"

"Careful words, Elder Xiang!" Elder Lu shot back. "Implying our leader's fault?"

"Enough!" Xuan Ming commanded. "I declare Yan Zhao wanted sect-wide—nay, realm-wide! Kill on sight! Bounties await his head!"

The decree sparked uproar. Disciples reeled—their admired senior, now a fugitive? Some murmured of possible mistake, but his flight spoke volumes.

For Elder Zheng, this proved fortuitous. Elder Lu exhaled heavily: "Sect Leader, Xiao Zhi warned me long ago."

"Why withhold this?" Xuan Ming snapped.

"Without evidence, I couldn't act. Now, let me clear Xiao Zhi's name—though infected by Blood Toxin, he's no willing traitor!"

As the crowd quieted under Xuan Ming's glare, Elder Lu continued: "When Xiao Zhi publicly transformed, I questioned—Blood Toxin erupts predictably, not randomly. He was framed!"

"You claim Yan Zhao orchestrated this?" Xuan Ming probed.

"Precisely! After their mission report, Yan Zhao followed Xiao Zhi out. Using the Millennium Peach Wood you gifted him, he forcibly activated Xiao Zhi's latent toxin!"

**Chapter 3818: Truth Revealed**

Xuan Ming paled. "Evidence?"

Elder Lu met his gaze. "I accuse not from hindsight. Long I suspected but lacked proof. Today's failed inspection confirms it. Let truth be told: Guan Yu first detected Yan Zhao's deceit. Upon his return, all shall be clear!"

"Guan Yu!" Xuan Ming's rage reignited. "That brat hides with the Eight-Sided Drum technique—unreported treasure! He dares not face judgment!"

Elder Zheng interjected, "Sect Leader, Guan Yu's insights could exonerate Xiao Zhi. We must—"

"Enough!" Xuan Ming thundered. "This council adjourns. Let every peak commence inspections! Dismissed!"
