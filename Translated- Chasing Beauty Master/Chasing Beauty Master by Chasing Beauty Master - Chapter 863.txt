“Handsome Brother, I heard you mention all those women who chased after you, throwing themselves at you willingly. That must feel amazing, right? Are exceptional heartthrobs like you rare?” Shuangshuang inquired curiously.

“Not really. Their pursuit didn’t affect me much. As long as they suit my taste, it’s fine. Like you—I like you too,” Guan Yu replied without hesitation.

The rooms were separated only by a thin door. Faint moans and gasps drifted over from Aunt’s room.

Guan Yu marveled inwardly—Uncle was still vigorous despite his age. Life seemed satisfying for them. Aunt’s cries carried an undeniable fervor. Before long, her panting breaths gave way to fragmented phrases like “faster” and “it’s coming,” barely audible through the walls.

Guan Yu marveled inwardly—Uncle was still vigorous despite his age. Life seemed satisfying for them. Aunt’s cries carried an undeniable fervor. Before long, her panting breaths gave way to fragmented phrases like “faster” and “it’s coming,” barely audible through the walls.

On the bed, Meimei flushed with embarrassment, her body burning. *How could Mom and Dad be so shameless? They’re usually loud, but tonight we have guests! Couldn’t they restrain themselves?* Mortified, she buried her face under the quilt, cheeks aflame.

As he spoke, Guan Yu’s hand wandered downward, tracing circles before brushing Shuangshuang’s thigh. Startled by the muffled sounds from the adjacent room and Guan Yu’s touch, Shuangshuang jolted as if electrocuted. A soft “Ah!” escaped her lips, her body temperature spiking.

This time, instead of resisting, she whispered coyly, “Handsome Brother, you’re so naughty. I never expected you to be this bold.”

“Not at all. I’m just teaching you resilience. It’s for your own good,” Guan Yu quipped.

“Oh? Really?”

“Of course. Don’t overthink it.” His restless hand resumed its exploration, stoking Shuangshuang’s rising heat. “Stop… you’re terrible,” she protested breathily, her voice dripping with affectation. Between the elderly couple’s audible passion and the escalating tension on the *kang* bed, Meimei squirmed in discomfort, desperately willing herself to sleep.

“If you keep this up, I’ll leave and ignore you,” Shuangshuang threatened, though her body remained motionless despite her words.

“Aren’t we practically engaged? A little touch won’t hurt.” Guan Yu’s composure had unraveled, stirred by the neighboring commotion.

Assuming Meimei feigned sleep, he grew bolder, roaming Shuangshuang’s body until her breaths turned ragged. Meimei, silent and flushed, found her own temperature climbing in response.

“I’m serious—I’ll go back!” Shuangshuang declared halfheartedly. Yet as she moved to leave, hesitation gripped her. *Poor Handsome Brother, stuck alone on this freezing bed…*

After a pause, she relented. “I’ll stay a bit longer, but no more touching!”

“This is for your growth. Everyone needs first experiences,” Guan Yu insisted.

“You’re just tricking me like a child! Since when is this proper teaching?”

“What’s wrong? You kissed me in the car earlier. Consider us even.”

Shuangshuang clapped a hand over his mouth, glancing anxiously at Meimei. *Please let Sister be asleep. If she hears, I’ll never hear the end of it!*

“Don’t mention that again. You can touch… lightly. But no extremes,” she breathed into his ear.

Guan Yu smirked, recognizing her fear. “Deal. Keep behaving, and I’ll take that secret to my grave.”

Trapping his arms in an embrace, Shuangshuang asked, “Satisfied?” The cramped space limited his movements.

“Ever heard of bone-feeling fortune-telling?” Guan Yu abruptly asked.

“Vaguely. Why?”

Seizing on her curiosity, Guan Yu proposed, “I’m skilled in it. After witnessing my healing earlier, trust me to read your bones?”

“Yes! Do it now!” Excitement lit her face. *He can even tell fortunes?*

On the bed, Meimei’s ears perked up. She emerged slightly from the covers, unnoticed—until Guan Yu’s sharp hearing caught her rustling.

**Chapter 2243: Master Manipulator**

“You’re not reading bones—you’re groping flesh! Stop treating me like a fool,” Shuangshuang accused, though she allowed his hands to wander until overwhelmed. Their lips met again, parting only when she pushed him away.

Meimei, straining to observe, heard Shuangshuang gasp, “Enough! You’re a wicked, philandering scoundrel!” Her fists playfully pummeled his chest.

“How is this my fault? You’re the one who—” Guan Yu’s retort died as Shuangshuang silenced him with another kiss.

“Never speak of that again,” she hissed. Guan Yu nodded, content with his conquests. Further advances were impossible—not with Meimei nearby and thin walls.

“You call this bone-reading? Pure deception!” Shuangshuang grumbled.

“Didn’t you enjoy it?” He chuckled. “Now, shall I interpret your fate? Love or wealth?”

“Love, obviously.” She shielded her chest, forcing him to pause.

“Love requires… deeper analysis. Another touch might clarify—”

“Liar! I’m done with you!”

*Modern girls are too sharp!* Guan Yu lamented. “Fine. Doubt me if you must.”

Relenting, Shuangshuang whispered, “One last try. Be precise.”

His hands roamed freely as heat thickened the air. Meimei writhed silently until Shuangshuang gasped, “Stop! You’re unbearable!”

Panting, she demanded, “Well? My future?”

Guan Yu adopted a sage tone. “You’ll marry well—a doting, dashing tycoon from City A, perhaps surnamed Guan?”

“Tease! I’m leaving.” Weakness delayed her exit. “Brute!”

“Stay. I’ll bunk with Meimei instead—read her fortune too.”

Hearing this, Meimei stiffened, a soft whimper escaping.

“Don’t you dare!” Shuangshuang wedged between them. “No harassing Sister!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Sleep then. Pity—tomorrow’s bride won’t know her marital prospects…”

Meimei turned abruptly. “Wait… read mine.” Curiosity triumphed.

“Sister, he’s a fraud!” Shuangshuang warned.

“What harm?” Meimei slipped into Guan Yu’s bedding, murmuring, “Proceed.”

**Chapter 2244: No Regrets**

Meimei’s bare form stunned Guan Yu—countryfolk often slept unclothed. As he took her hand, his fingers traced callouses from farmwork. His other hand strayed lower, encountering no resistance.

Shuangshuang interrupted their heated moment. “Done yet?”

“Y-yes,” Guan Yu stammered. Meimei shot her sister a resentful glance.

“Well?” she asked breathlessly.

“Your marriage will be… adequate. Your husband kind, life ordinary. But beware—infidelity looms. Don’t get caught.”

Meimei absorbed this, torn between belief and suspicion, as the old couple’s final cries echoed next door. Guan Yu remarked, “Such passion! Youth pales in comparison.”

The sisters blushed furiously, humiliated. Guan Yu slid beside Meimei. “Fear not—this is true divination.”

As he reached for her, Shuangshuang lunged between them. “No! You greedy rogue!”

Defeated, Guan Yu yawned. “Sleep. Tomorrow’s big day awaits.”

But Meimei’s whisper halted him: “Continue. I… want to know.”

Shuangshuang glared. “He’ll exploit you!”

“I’ll risk it.” Meimei’s resolve held. Guan Yu smiled—another victory.
