Hou Jinshun brandished his broadsword, pressing its cold edge against Xiang Jiamian’s nose. “From this moment on,” he growled, “you’ll answer every question Guan Yu asks. If not, I’ll use your own blade to chop off your hands and feet. Believe me, I’ll do it!”

The threat sounded vicious, but Xiang Jiamian—a man who had spent years intimidating others with his blade—remained outwardly unfazed. How ironic that the predator now found himself prey, the tables turned cruelly against him. Though his face contorted with rage, fear gnawed at his gut like a rabid rat. Even among the Ten Great Evildoers, none could face their own mortality without trembling. His crimes had always been committed from a position of power; never before had cold steel threatened his flesh.

Xiang squeezed his eyes shut, pretending deafness to Hou’s threats. The slap of the broadsword’s flat against his cheek echoed dully. “Still playing tough?” Hou sneered. “Your thick skin can’t save you now.” Without warning, the blade flashed downward. A wet crunch echoed through the chamber as Xiang’s severed foot thudded to the floor.

Screams erupted as blood arced through the air. Spectators recoiled, young women shielding their eyes. Even Xue Jing, standing several paces back, paled as crimson droplets spattered her sleeves. The metallic tang of blood filled the air as Hou pressed his gore-slicked blade to Xiang’s throat. “Next time,” he hissed, “it’ll be your head.”

Guan Yu watched impassively, surprised by Hou’s ruthless efficiency. While he’d ordered tendons severed in past interrogations, this brutal amputation crossed lines even he hesitated to approach. “Stop the bleeding,” he commanded. “We need him conscious.”

Hou’s lackeys moved with practiced efficiency, binding the stump with torn cloth and rope. As the bloodflow slowed, Xiang’s screams subsided into whimpers. Guan Yu loomed over the broken man. “Shall I repeat my questions?”

Xiang’s ashen face glistened with sweat. “I... serve Bi Erlin,” he gasped, “but Poison Widow’s the true master. My task was to infiltrate your circle... destroy you completely.” Each word came labored, yet laced with reluctant admiration. The young gang leader’s reputation hadn’t done him justice—this wolf in human skin sniffed out deception like bloodhounds scent prey.

“Killing me would’ve been simpler,” Guan Yu mused, eyeing the cauterized stump. “But Bi Erlin’s coin bought you inadequate intelligence.” He leaned closer. “A one-legged cur holds no value—not to me, nor your masters. Speak of the tannery plots, and perhaps I’ll grant cleaner death than your enemies would.”

Chapter 2956: Negotiations (Finale)

As Xiang rasped out fragmented truths, wheels turned elsewhere. Poison Widow paced Feng Manor’s opulent halls, her stiletto heels clicking like countdown ticks. “The fool’s been compromised,” she hissed at Bi Erlin. “Send Luo Bo with two hundred men. Crush Yu Gang’s rabble at the garment factory!”

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei’s forces retreated from their systematic demolition, thirty vehicles snaking through predawn streets. Headlights pierced the gloom—Feng’s reinforcements arrived in force. Luo Bo stepped from the lead car, squaring off against the statuesque琼斯 (Joan) who blocked his path.

“A bodyguard playing soldier?” Joan taunted, her twin dao gleaming. Behind her, shadows resolved into rows of black-clad fighters—Free Society operatives far outclassing Feng’s thugs.

Luo’s grin held no mirth. “Children and theater performers,” he scoffed, though his eyes betrayed unease. The air crackled with impending violence as dawn’s first light bled across the horizon.

Unseen in the chaos, a figure observed from a nearby rooftop. His gloved hand tightened around a sniper rifle’s stock—an insurance policy Poison Widow had planted days prior. The crosshairs drifted between Joan’s forehead and Luo Bo’s heart. Whoever fell first would determine tonight’s victor... and the balance of power in the city’s underworld.
