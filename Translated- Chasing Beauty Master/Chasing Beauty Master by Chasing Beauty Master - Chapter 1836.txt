Several days later, Guan Yu returned to the capital. His first stop was the Red Rouge Theater to assess its condition. Upon arrival, he found everything largely unchanged except for the cleared debris where the collapsed stage once stood.

The theater's doors stood wide open yet eerily empty. Curious, Guan Yu ventured inside and encountered the deputy manager. "Deputy Manager, is Chu Fan here?" he inquired.

"Oh, the manager went out this morning and hasn't returned. No one knows where he went," the deputy replied.

"Where is everyone else? Why is this place so deserted?" Guan Yu frowned, recalling he had instructed them to renovate freely before his departure.

"The manager distributed silver for medical expenses and recuperation, allowing everyone to return home until we rebuild. Restoring the theater will take time," the deputy explained.

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. The theater's decline felt like a personal failure. He had invested heavily in this venture, only to suffer losses from the Cao Family's sabotage. "Let everyone rest for now. Tomorrow, we begin rebuilding. Have Chu Fan report to me upon his return."

After nodding, the deputy withdrew. Though weary from travel, Guan Yu's mind buzzed with unfinished business. He recalled his previous meeting with Jiang Yuankai, who had revealed the Cao Family's reliance on their daughters' connections for wealth.

Retiring to his quarters, Guan Yu applied Wang Xiaorong's disguise technique—a skill he deeply appreciated. Unlike crude methods like animal-hide masks, this art used spiritual energy to alter facial features and even body proportions, rendering him unrecognizable.

Wang Xiaorong had inherited this rare technique from the Demon Lord, who deemed it unusable until she mastered it effortlessly. Surprisingly, Guan Yu had also grasped it during Prince Zou's escort mission—a feat that defied the Demon Lord's assumption of its gender-specific nature. Perhaps his unique dual spiritual-physical constitution enabled this exception.

Conserving energy, Guan Yu merely adjusted his facial contours to appear older before heading to a nearby Cao-owned gambling den. The establishment, previously seized from a merchant named Li through false charges, thrived despite its sordid history.

The bustling casino reeked of sweat and desperation. Guan Yu entered unchallenged, his fine attire granting immediate passage. Inside, a long hall stretched fifty meters with crowded gaming tables.

At a dice table, a thirtyish female dealer in a crimson qipao commanded attention. Her plunging neckline distracted gamblers as she expertly shook the dice cup. Guan Yu observed her subtle techniques—strategic pauses, calculated slams—ensuring the house always won by balancing bets.

After three cautious rounds, Guan Yu boldly placed fifty taels on "Big." The dealer shot him a sharp glance, then revealed "Small." Undeterred, he doubled his bet, drawing followers. "Trust me, it's Big!" he proclaimed, rallying the crowd.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's allies mobilized. Du Teng, his trusted lieutenant, supervised the theater's reconstruction using funds from Swordless Villa's vaults—a treasure trove including daily earnings from the thriving Swordless Inn.

Back at the casino, the dealer alternated wins and losses to string along Guan Yu, now wagering hundred-tael notes. When he next pushed a stack toward "Big," dozens followed suit. The dealer's hands imperceptibly tensed on the cup—this round demanded special handling.

As the dice clattered, Guan Yu hid a smirk. Let them think him a rich fool. Soon enough, substantial wins would lure out the Cao Family's overseers. Tonight's game had only just begun.
