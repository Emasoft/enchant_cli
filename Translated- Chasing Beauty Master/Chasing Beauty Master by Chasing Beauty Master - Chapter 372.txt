The night highway was sparsely dotted with scattered vehicles. Occasionally, one or two cars sped past Guan Yu, all accelerating without exception—no one dared stop to witness the commotion.

This was an accident-prone zone, and the two men by the roadside appeared locked in mortal enmity. Who would willingly court misfortune in such circumstances?

Of course, the passersby guessed correctly—Guan Yu and Long Tian indeed harbored a blood feud!

Under the dim yellow streetlights, Guan Yu narrowed his eyes at the silent Long Tian and sneered, “What’s wrong? Cat got your tongue? Or are you playing for time, waiting for reinforcements?”

Long Tian’s expression shifted dramatically as an inexplicable sense of peril gripped his heart. Meeting Guan Yu’s gaze, he felt as though all his secrets lay exposed.

Guan Yu had guessed right. A cautious man like Long Tian would never confront an enemy alone without gauging their strength. He had merely taken the vanguard role to test his opponent’s capabilities. If manageable, he’d handle it himself. If outmatched, the backup lying in wait would serve as insurance.

Long Tian’s legendary status within the Haomen clan wasn’t built solely on martial prowess—his strategic mind played an equal part. True mastery required both courage and cunning.

Yet now, his meticulously crafted, foolproof plan showed cracks. This development placed his life in grave danger. He couldn’t predict whether Guan Yu would kill him immediately to eliminate future threats.

Though it sounded absurd, Long Tian felt a visceral dread he hadn’t experienced in years—a harbinger of impending catastrophe.

His eyes flickering with calculation, Long Tian glared coldly and declared in an icy tone, “I told you—no matter what, your end remains the same: death!”

Emphasizing the final word, Long Tian pushed off the ground with his palms, propelled himself upward with a powerful kick, and launched a ferocious punch toward Guan Yu’s face. The fist tore through the air with a faint whistle—clearly no mere show of force.

The movement flowed seamlessly, executed in one breath.

A flicker of surprise crossed Guan Yu’s eyes, quickly replaced by a cold smirk. Activating the ancient copper coin suspended in his consciousness, azure light erupted as the words “Gravity System” glowed—60% weight reduction concentrated on his right fist.

“Bone-Shattering Fist!”

Guan Yu’s low shout accompanied his counterpunch. At the moment of collision, his gravity system switched to weight amplification. The explosive force contained in that strike became terrifying.

Boom!

The fists collided. Long Tian’s face twisted anew as indescribable power surged through his arm, ravaging his entire body. He flew backward uncontrollably and crashed heavily onto the pavement.

A pained groan escaped Long Tian as he stared at his grotesquely twisted right arm. A single move had reduced him to utter defeat. One punch shattered his so-called legend and myth!

“Tch. The Haomen sent trash like you to kill me? What a joke!” Guan Yu scoffed, discreetly flexing his numb, aching fist beneath his cloak. Despite choosing to meet force with force, the outcome surprised even him. While humiliating Long Tian, his own hand throbbed painfully—proof that his opponent’s skills weren’t as worthless as claimed.

“Of course, you can scuttle back with a message. If the Haomen only has third-rate amateurs like you, don’t bother coming again. I’ve no time to waste on mediocre punching bags—they’re not even worth using as sandbags!”

Long Tian nearly vomited blood from rage. A celebrated figure reduced to insignificance before Guan Yu? Unbearable! He had to reclaim his dignity and prove his worth—not just validate himself, but erase Guan Yu from existence.

Thus, Long Tian moved again!

Springing up, he charged Guan Yu. Halting a meter away, he pivoted on his left foot and unleashed a lightning-fast side kick toward Guan Yu’s waist.

“Truly a glutton for punishment.”

Guan Yu shook his head but remained vigilant. His own right leg shot out faster and fiercer. He welcomed this brute-force exchange—thanks to his healing system, any non-fatal injury would cripple his foe.

But Long Tian, having learned his lesson, refused another direct clash. As Guan Yu’s foot lashed out, Long Tian twisted his waist, deftly evading the strike. Using the momentum, he spun and swung a fist at Guan Yu’s neck.

Guan Yu blocked with his forearm, bent low, and drove an elbow enhanced by the gravity system into Long Tian’s abdomen—faster than his opponent could react.

Boom!

Long Tian folded like a shrimp, blood spurting from his mouth as he collapsed convulsing at Guan Yu’s feet. The undeniable truth lay before him—he wasn’t even worthy of being Guan Yu’s opponent. His proud racing skills paled in comparison, and his martial prowess proved utterly pathetic.

Yet a faint smile tugged his lips—his stalling tactic had succeeded. Reinforcements would arrive soon!

**Chapter 935: The Threat**

“Do you think your delay tactic worked? That your allies are coming? That my death approaches?”

Guan Yu’s mocking voice pierced Long Tian’s triumphant reverie, jolting him into feigned composure.

“Aren’t you curious?” Guan Yu continued. “If I knew your plan and recognized your weakness, why waste time playing with you? Care to guess?”

He chuckled. “Certainly not to let your friends turn me into Swiss cheese!”

Long Tian’s face finally showed true alarm. Guan Yu’s words revealed disturbing possibilities he dared not acknowledge. Dread seeped into his heart.

“Humoring you was just boredom relief while waiting—a passing itch to pummel someone. Otherwise, wasting energy on your pathetic skills? The rice I eat to replenish strength isn’t free, damn it!”

Guan Yu’s contempt stung deeper than bitter herbs. Long Tian mentally cursed: “Who the hell wants to fight you, you lunatic? ‘Just wanting to beat someone’? You’re spitting on my dignity!”

Before he could retort, Guan Yu cut in: “Speak of the devil—perfect timing for your beating! Hey, that rhymes! Destiny decrees you’re punch fodder!”

Long Tian longed to slap Guan Yu’s smug face but froze at the sudden appearance of another man—materializing like a ghost, silent-footed, cigarette smoke veiling features that exuded menace.

“Damn, if not a ghost, he’s cosplaying as one,” Long Tian inwardly swore.

“Xiao Lin, he called you a ghost,” Guan Yu laughed.

The newcomer was Lin Dong, urgently summoned by Guan Yu. Aware of Haomen’s might and lacking allies in the capital, Guan Yu had called for backup.

Lin Dong glanced sideways, plunging Long Tian into an icy hallucination—for one heartbeat, he felt already dead. Cold sweat drenched his back. Never before had silent presence instilled such bone-deep terror. Now, he desperately wished to eliminate Guan Yu,恩怨 aside.

Bafflement struck—how had Guan Yu known his unspoken insult? Mind-reading? Why wasn’t this bastard buying lottery tickets instead?

“Settled?” Guan Yu asked Lin Dong, ignoring Long Tian.

Stretching lazily, Lin Dong nodded with habitual sarcasm: “Minor pests had you quaking? They say courage shrinks with age, but you’re barely grown yet! By fifty, ‘mouse-hearted’ would flatter you.”

Guan Yu nearly slapped him. “I didn’t need you for those small fries! But their backer is Haomen! Not that a country bumpkin like you would know...”

Lin Dong yawned. “Met Li Yu on a mission once. Wasn’t my target then—else he’d be dead.”

Long Tian scoffed inwardly at the boast. Guan Yu, however, twitched—he knew Lin Dong never bluffed.

Seizing the opening, Guan Yu fawned: “Brother Lin! If you could’ve killed Li Yu once, you can again! Let’s discuss—”

“No discussion,” Lin Dong cut coldly. “I’m no deity. Killing Li Yu? Not happening.”

Guan Yu’s face fell. Stubborn ass!

As a Haomen warrior, Long Tian couldn’t stomach their audacity. “You think Yu-ye is easily challenged? Delusional! Even with two hundred men, you couldn’t touch a hair on his head!”

“True?” Guan Yu asked.

“For two hundred like you? Yes,” Lin Dong taunted.

Guan Yu’s face darkened. “Can’t reach him, eh?” He suddenly kicked Long Tian’s ribs, eliciting a scream. “But I can reach you!”

His voice turned glacial. “Tell me—if Haomen loses a champion, will Li Yu go mad?”

**Chapter 936: The Frenzied Self-Destruction**

Long Tian’s heart plunged. His worst fear materialized—the hunter becoming prey.

“Dare you?” he forced through clenched teeth.

Guan Yu’s chilling laugh answered. “Stupid question. Having brought you this low, why hesitate to finish it?”

“You wouldn’t!” Long Tian spat. “Kill me, and Haomen’s wrath will hound you eternally! I know them—know Yu-ye—better than you!”

Guan Yu shrugged, unimpressed. “Ripping you out alive from the tiger’s jaws—bloody and raw—might make Li Yu think twice. Besides...” He eyed Long Tian. “Given what I’ve cost Haomen, is reconciliation possible? No. So you die.”

Long Tian paled. Guan Yu saw through everything—the billions lost when Guan Yu erased a Haomen car empire overnight. Yu-ye’s fury demanded blood. Only full restitution could placate him... which Guan Yu would never provide.

Facing such an adversary chilled Long Tian—one who matched his every calculation. Yet he’d never suspect Guan Yu’s surveillance systems.

The true horror lay in Guan Yu’s next words: “Eliminating you serves as warning. Let Haomen comprehend—move against me, and their teeth get pulled one by one.”

Long Tian’s lips moved soundlessly, the crushing reality rendering him mute. His legend, his pride—all crushed underfoot. Even now, reinforcements delayed...

Guan Yu leaned closer, death in his smile. “Any last words?”

The highway wind howled through silence. Somewhere, engines roared—too late. Long Tian closed his eyes, awaiting the end. Yet his fingers twitched toward a hidden device...

A flash. A beep.

Guan Yu’s eyes widened. “You madman—!”

The explosion lit the night.
