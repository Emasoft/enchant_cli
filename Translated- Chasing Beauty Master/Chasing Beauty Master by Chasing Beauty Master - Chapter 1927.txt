At least this long sword was considered a treasure by Guan Yu. When time permitted in the future, he would surely find Qiqi a suitable and fine weapon.

For now, those Guan Yu cared about most already possessed satisfactory magical artifacts or weapons. Though he was concerned about Wang Xiaorong, her Butterfly Pouch had no superior replacement, and Guan Yu lacked better artifacts to offer her.

The Jade Ruyi he gave Siqi was a high-grade magical artifact. Even compared to Wang Xiaorong’s Butterfly Pouch, it held its own.

Wang Jun obtained a Jade Flute, though its original name remained unknown. Rumored to have been wielded by a high-ranking figure from the Demon Sect, such advanced artifacts were rare. Acquiring it was a stroke of fortune. Though tinged with demonic aura, Wang Jun’s cultivation over time, combined with the Yunqing Sect’s innate resistance to malevolent energies, would eventually transform the flute into an exceptional artifact.

Xiao Zhi and Aze’s artifacts, though mid-grade, were commendable—a bronze lock and a calligraphy brush, gifts from Xuanming. These were formidable tools. Unlike others, Xiao Zhi’s cultivation path required little reliance on artifacts.

Taming spirit beasts was a mystery to others. Only after reaching a certain cultivation level would results manifest. Though progress might be slow, Xiao Zhi’s dedication promised future greatness, and his temperament suited this arduous path.

Du Bingyan wielded the Blood Sword gifted by Guan Yu. Though categorized as an artifact, its material was exceptionally hard and sharp, perfectly complementing her modest martial skills. With it, her combat prowess had ascended markedly.

Lastly, Qiqi. Her skills had improved greatly, but during recent drills, she resorted to practicing with a branch for lack of a proper weapon.

The long sword Guan Yu retrieved from the Swordless Villa’s vault was exceptional—razor-sharp. The vault housed numerous renowned weapons, many left behind by defeated challengers. Guan Yu chose this sword partly due to Wang Jun’s influence.

While rummaging through a golden mound, Wang Jun unearthed the sword. Guan Yu noted most weapons were neatly displayed on wall racks, suggesting the villa’s late master valued order.

When Wang Jin casually tossed the sword aside after finding it unremarkable, its blade cleaved through a gold ingot upon landing. Though gold isn’t hard, the blade’s effortless cut—relying solely on its weight—astounded them.

Intrigued, Guan Yu claimed the sword. Light as plastic yet unnaturally sharp, its material baffled him, but he deemed it a treasure. Now, it would go to Qiqi.

As Guan Yu presented the sword, Qiqi grinned, anticipating another prized possession. She never hesitated to claim his offerings.

**Chapter 5064: A Melodious Name**

Qiqi approached, eyeing the plain-looking sword skeptically. Yet she trusted Guan Yu’s discernment—nothing he carried was ordinary.

As she reached for it, Jiang Yuan gasped. “Could this be… the legendary Fairy Sword? Unless it’s a replica?”

“Brother Jiang recognizes it?” Guan Yu handed him the blade. “I found it in an obscure place. It seems ordinary but defies logic—unbelievably sharp yet featherlight. Its material eludes me.”

Jiang Yuan examined the hilt’s egg-shaped, dull-yellow stone—its sole ornament. Upon closer inspection, he inhaled sharply, disbelief etched on his face.

Drawing the blade released a shrill, metallic screech that lingered like a whistling wind. Jiang Yuan’s excitement grew. “Without doubt, this is the Fairy Sword! Every detail matches the legends!”

“Such a lovely name!” Qiqi chimed, noting his awe.

Guan Yu chuckled. Qiqi’s endearing simplicity contrasted with the shrewdness of others like Wang Xiaorong, Siqi, or Duan Ruxue. He preferred her guileless charm.

“Ordinary?” Jiang Yuan twirled the sword. “Two decades ago, the Immortal Lovers would’ve been enraged by such words!”

“Immortal Lovers?” Guan Yu asked.

“Their renown stemmed from this very blade,” Jiang Yuan explained. “During a martial arts conference twenty years ago, this couple emerged from obscurity, challenging elites. The man was dashing, the woman peerlessly beautiful. Together, they defeated six top contenders—myself included—seeking to challenge the Swordless Immortal. After entering the villa, they vanished… along with this sword.”

He tossed a silver ingot and sliced it midair. The blade emerged unscathed. “None could withstand its edge. My ancestral saber shattered against it. Many retired their prized weapons rather than face destruction.”

Returning the sword, he mused, “Its return heralds upheaval.”

Guan Yu dismissed concerns. With him nearby, Qiqi’s safety was assured.

Ecstatic, Qiqi unsheathed the sword. Despite its length—nearly five feet—its lightness suited her petite frame. Channeling energy into a practice strike, the hilt’s stone flashed gold, releasing a crescent wave that felled a distant tree and scarred a wall.

Jiang Yuan shook his head, awed. “A treasure’s power is staggering.”

Earlier, Qiqi’s branch had barely snapped. Now, the sword amplified her prowess exponentially.
