Afterward, he gathered several friends to study the ox, eventually deciding to dissect it for answers. After all, it was exceedingly rare for an ox to wield magical abilities, and they were determined to uncover the reason behind its supernatural demise.

Following the dissection and extensive research, they discovered that one of the ox’s leg bones radiated an intense aura of spiritual energy. Remarkably, all the spiritual energy within the ox’s body originated from this single leg.

In the end, after extracting the leg bone and refining it through spiritual cultivation, it was supposed to become a high-tier magic artifact. However, the refinement process failed, leaving the bone as nothing more than an ordinary magical tool—far inferior to their expectations.

No one knows how this ox leg bone ended up in the hands of Chief Zheng, who later gifted it to Xiao Zhi. Among the disciples of the Yunqing Sect, Xiao Zhi’s possession of this bone was already considered an exceptional artifact.

Most disciples wielded Yunqing Swords—the most basic of magic artifacts. In the cultivation world, magic tools held paramount importance, and only the Yunqing Sect, as the largest sect, could afford to equip every disciple with a Yunqing Sword.

Other sects might not even manage to provide their disciples with such rudimentary tools.

Guan Yu had initially wondered why the Yunqing Sect’s chiefs, with their profound cultivation and abundant collections of artifacts, didn’t distribute superior tools to their disciples. Doing so could significantly enhance their disciples’ cultivation and accelerate their progress.

Now he understood: though the chiefs possessed many artifacts, their numbers were limited. Distributing them unevenly would breed jealousy and discord, undermining the sect’s unity.

Guan Yu had also thought that since the chiefs possessed high cultivation and the ability to refine artifacts, why not spend their ample free time crafting tools for their disciples? If every Yunqing disciple’s artifact were elevated a tier, the sect’s overall strength would rise exponentially.

But now he realized why the chiefs refrained. Refining artifacts consumed vast amounts of spiritual energy, which required time to replenish—unlike hunger, which a meal could satiate.

Excessive depletion of spiritual energy demanded prolonged rest to recover. The only way to increase one’s spiritual reserves was through relentless cultivation.

Moreover, refining artifacts required not just energy but rare materials. High-quality materials were exceedingly scarce, while common ones often produced useless artifacts inferior even to Yunqing Swords.

Naturally, higher-tier artifacts demanded greater refinement skill and spiritual power. Without sufficient cultivation, crafting superior tools was impossible.

Evidently, refining artifacts was arduous, and the Yunqing Sect’s ability to mass-produce Yunqing Swords for its disciples was already commendable.

In the cultivation world, a superior magic artifact was more precious than life itself—exceedingly rare. Xiao Zhi’s possession of one, despite its comical appearance, was the envy of many.

Standing on the platform with the large bone in hand, Xiao Zhi waved cheerfully at Guan Yu. The crowd below roared with encouragement.

On the other side, Jiang Chao ascended the stage clutching a Yunqing Sword, his face icy as though owed an unpaid debt. While the audience had cheered for Xiao Zhi, Jiang Chao’s arrival hushed them. Only a few disciples from the Bamboo Forest Peak raised half-hearted shouts.

“Seems Jiang Chao isn’t very popular,” Guan Yu mused. This was his first time seeing Jiang Chao—a tall, gaunt man with a long face, downturned lips, and a complexion marred by acne scars. His perpetually sullen expression blended a bitter melon’s frown with a shoehorn’s curve.

According to Wang Jun’s account the previous night, Jiang Chao spoke little, had no friends, and devoted himself entirely to cultivation. His current prowess was earned through sheer diligence, yet even the Bamboo Forest Peak’s Chief Mu held him in low regard.

**Chapter 3307: Doomed**

His wooden demeanor and poor social skills had alienated him. Other disciples often slandered him before Chief Mu, worsening his reputation until the chief ignored him entirely.

Isolated, Jiang Chao grew increasingly reclusive. After fifteen years in the Yunqing Sect, his relentless effort had earned him a place in the tournament. Today, he sought to prove his worth.

He yearned to reach the semifinals, to regain face before his peers and Chief Mu, to show that the chief’s neglect had blinded him to talent.

Jiang Chao faced Xiao Zhi with fierce determination. While Xiao Zhi had thoroughly researched his opponent, Jiang Chao knew nothing of Xiao Zhi—friendless and shunned, save for occasional conversations with Wang Jun.

Wang Jun found Jiang Chao decent, if taciturn. Yet Jiang Chao never initiated conversation, leaving Wang Jun to approach him. Despite enduring constant ridicule, Jiang Chao never retorted.

Xiao Zhi’s familiarity with Jiang Chao gave him an edge. With their cultivation levels comparable, strategy would decide the match.

“Greetings, Junior Brother Jiang Chao,” Xiao Zhi said amiably. Having joined the sect earlier, Xiao Zhi outranked Jiang Chao in seniority, despite Jiang Chao’s age.

Jiang Chao responded with a silent bow. His advancement to the top eight had stunned the Bamboo Forest Peak. Chief Mu, who’d pinned hopes on Wang Jun, now marveled at Jiang Chao’s unexpected rise.

Yet Jiang Chao’s aloof exit after conceding the match—ignoring his sectmates and chief—left Chief Mu fuming, vowing to punish his insolence.

**Chapter 3308: Transgression**

Unaware of the offense he’d caused, Jiang Chao retreated, disheartened. Years of toil had brought him inches from the semifinals, only to falter. He avoided his peers, dreading their scorn.

His departure, however, alienated the entire Bamboo Forest Peak. Some disciples conspired to retaliate.

As cheers engulfed Xiao Zhi, Grandmaster Xuanming announced the next match: Siqi of the Convergence Peak versus Linchen of the Tiger Summit.

Siqi ascended with her jade Ruyi scepter, its spiritual aura awe-inspiring. Linchen, wielding a Yunqing Sword, leered at her.

“What a pity to face you,” Linchen sneered. “Hurting you—even staining your robes—would be a crime.”

Siqi remained impassive. At Xuanming’s signal, she raised her Ruyi, its power dwarfing Linchen’s sword. The crowd gasped. Even Xuanming sighed, realizing Linchen’s defeat was inevitable.

Linchen, deflated, glanced at his blade and called out, “Wait!” But Siqi, poised to cast, ignored him. The Ruyi’s glow intensified, sealing his fate.
