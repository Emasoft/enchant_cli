“All members of the organization are cultivators, though their exact cultivation levels remain uncertain. After all, Ge Yinglai and his associates had only recently contacted these people, spending thirty million to hire the entire organization. They were kept in reserve precisely for causing tonight's commotion at the doorstep.

As expected, their five hundred men proved utterly inadequate against Guan Yu. Now that three more experts had joined the opposing side, pushing their forces into retreat, Sun Xu couldn't allow this situation to continue. He immediately called Yaozi to bring reinforcements.

Yaozi, the deputy leader of the Yuejing Organization, earned his nickname from his kidney-shaped face. Leading over a hundred men from their group, he'd originally been stationed near Qiaoyuan District for an ambush against Guan Yu's forces. But events had outpaced their plans.

With the Yu Gang's reinforcements yet to arrive and their frontline collapsing, Yaozi's intervention became crucial. Otherwise, these cannon fodder would soon be wiped out. Upon receiving Sun Xu's summons, Yaozi charged in from a flanking position with his hundred-strong contingent brandishing diverse weapons.

Witnessing this surge, the head guard at the main gate urgently requested Guan Yu's permission to deploy weapons. Guan Yu hesitated upon receiving this report. The enemy had mobilized far more cultivators than anticipated. Without expert reinforcements, even fifty elite guards would struggle against a hundred cultivators – and suffer heavy casualties.

Meanwhile, Jones and Shensheng's combined efforts had felled two black-cloaked assailants, their chests bloodied and bodies motionless on the ground. Guan Yu ordered Shensheng's group to reinforce the entrance. Jones, using her last defeated opponent as a human shield, bulldozed through to the gate, her brutal tactics sending shockwaves through enemy ranks. Even Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu felt a chill – this woman fought with terrifying ferocity.

The human shield, clearly deceased after being battered through the crowd, exemplified her ruthlessness. Though the fifty guards faced overwhelming pressure against a hundred cultivators, the arrival of three experts stabilized the situation. However, the sheer number of enemy cultivators posed relentless challenges. Even Jones required time to subdue multiple opponents, unlike her usual one-strike kills against ordinary foes.

Guan Yu observed the battlefield from a vehicle roof despite Xue Jing's protests about visibility making him an easy target. Chaos reigned as Free Organization members scattered while enemies swarmed, exploiting numerical advantage with backstabbing tactics. Combatants had to develop eyes in the back of their heads.

At the gate, Shensheng, Xiaobai, and Jones held their ground against swarming attackers. Though outnumbered three or four to one, they maintained parity through skill. Casualties mounted on both sides until Guan Yu received Wei Hongwei's call: “Boss, Feng Family's exterior is heavily guarded. Should I proceed with Phase Two?”

Guan Yu ordered Jia Bo's remaining hundred Yu Gang members to reinforce their position while directing others to raid Ge and Sun's undermanned territories. The strategic play aimed to capitalize on enemy concentration here.

Ge Yinglai grew uneasy. “How long must this drag on? I didn't sign up for an all-nighter!”

Sun Xu coldly assessed: “We're trading fifty cannon fodder for each of their elites. Our reserves will deplete first. Worse still – where are the Yu Gang forces? Those fighting aren't students but seasoned cultivators.”

Realization dawned on Ge Yinglai. The absence of familiar Yu Gang faces like Wei Hongwei meant Guan Yu had other cards yet to play. Panicked, he hissed: “We need an exit strategy before their main force arrives!”

Sun Xu remained analytical: “The Yu Gang's delay suggests diverted priorities. Perhaps they're...” His speculation trailed off as engine roars announced approaching vehicles. Jia Bo's reinforcements had arrived, blocking escape routes with dozens of cars.

On Guan Yu's command, Bearded Titan roared towards the gate battle, his warclub clearing paths through terrified enemies. “Xiaobai! I've got your back!” he bellowed, smashing into the fray with earth-shaking blows.

As combatants adapted tactics – fighting back-to-back to prevent flanking – Guan Yu's forces regained momentum. The tide was turning, and Ge Yinglai's earlier confidence evaporated. Survival, not victory, now dominated his thoughts.”
