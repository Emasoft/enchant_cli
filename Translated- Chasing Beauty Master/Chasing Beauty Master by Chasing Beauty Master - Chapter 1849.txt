Duan Ruxue said, "The Cao Family's recent enemies would be Chu Fan from Rouge Theater and another man named Wan Hong."

"Those people?" Tang Muchen muttered softly. "They're just minor characters. Surely they wouldn't warrant such drastic reactions from the Cao Family."

"You're mistaken, Young Master Tang." Duan Ruxue countered. "Cao Di was severely injured by Wan Hong here. Jiang Yuankai has been shielding Wan Hong single-handedly, and there's even rumors from the capital claiming Wan Hong is Jiang Yuankai's chosen son-in-law. You must have heard this."

"With Cao Di still bedridden from his injuries, given Patriarch Cao's obsessive doting on his son, retaliation against Rouge Theater is inevitable. The Cao Family knows full well about Wan Hong's connection to the theater and Chu Fan's relationship with Jiang Xin."

"Do you think Jiang Xin would stand idly by while the Cao Family nearly destroyed Rouge Theater? The man she loves, Chu Fan, even suffered leg injuries. Considering this, the Cao Family's current troubles likely originate from the Imperial Son-in-Law's residence."

Tang Muchen pondered this before exclaiming, "Now that you mention it, this makes perfect sense! Chu Fan's injury stems directly from Cao's retaliation. Given Jiang Xin's relationship with Chu Fan and Wan Hong's ties to Jiang Yuankai, this must be the Imperial Son-in-Law's household assisting Rouge Theater's counterattack against the Cao Family."

"But if even we can deduce this, the Cao clan aren't fools. Shouldn't they have realized too? If they suspect Jiang Yuankai's involvement, why not confront the Imperial Son-in-Law's residence directly?"

"Are you a pig-brained fool?" Duan Ruxue snapped impatiently. "Do you think the Cao Family dares provoke the Imperial Son-in-Law lightly? Even with concrete evidence, they wouldn't dare move against that household. Neither the Imperial Son-in-Law nor the Grand Princess are to be trifled with."

"This is precisely why the Cao Family secretly seeks alliance with the Qin Family despite knowing their enemy's strength. Our two families will inevitably be drawn into this conflict. Patriarch Cao will stop at nothing to avenge his son. While the future remains unclear, we should observe this tiger fight from the mountainside unless directly threatened."

"I understand. You needn't worry, Miss Duan," Tang Muchen replied calmly.

"Good. I feared your mind only housed women, but it seems salvageable after all," Duan Ruxue retorted sarcastically.

Tang Muchen smiled bitterly at her barb. "This all stems from that troublesome Chu Fan. I can't fathom what Jiang Xin sees in that pretty-faced actor. A mere performer causing such upheaval!"

"Jiang Xin's discernment exceeds yours, at least. Should she hear you disparage Chu Fan, your troubles would multiply," Duan Ruxue warned.

"Then there's that detestable Wan Hong," Tang Muchen grumbled. "Appearing suddenly in the capital like a mushroom after rain, stirring up constant commotion. His mere presence irritates me."

"You know Wan Hong?" Duan Ruxue asked curiously.

"Not exactly. We've crossed paths a few times." Tang Muchen gestured vaguely. "You saw him earlier - the man in white standing beside me outside."

"That was Wan Hong?" Duan Ruxue's eyes lit up. The unorthodox man causing recent uproars appeared even more intriguing up close.

She mentally cataloged his exploits: purchasing a black gemstone at Classical Auction House, gifting Jiang Xin the East Sea Dragon Pearl initially mistaken as the Grand Princess's pawn against Chu Fan, then astonishingly buying Rouge Theater's estate himself. The subsequent Dragon Pearl revelations had reignited decades-old rumors about East Sea treasures.

From appearing at Jiang Yuankai's banquet where Cao Di was beaten, to every subsequent conflict involving Rouge Theater - Wan Hong seemed the epicenter of capital intrigues since his arrival. Duan Ruxue resolved to meet this enigma.

"Young Master Tang, our agreement stands. I take my leave now on urgent business. We'll reconnect when opportunity arises." With that, Duan Ruxue turned to depart.

"May I visit the Duan residence later? Don't bar your gates against me," Tang Muchen called after her.

"My doors remain open," she replied without turning back.

Watching her retreat, Tang Muchen sighed. Though briefly tempted by her beauty, he knew better than to provoke the formidable Duan heiress. With their families now allied, patience would serve better than haste.

Reaching the second-floor staircase, Duan Ruxue paused to scan below. There stood Wan Hong with Chu Fan and Jiang Xin, conversing animatedly. Her luminous eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she devised an approach strategy.

**Chapter 4860: Close Ties**

Few in the capital could grievously wound Cao Di then lounge unscathed, even under Jiang Yuankai's protection. Yet Wan Hong sat casually, disregard for the Cao Family evident. What backing empowered such audacity? Duan Ruxue burned with curiosity.

Deciding to leverage childhood ties with Jiang Xin, she approached gracefully. "Jiang Xin! Still here? I was occupied with Tang Muchen earlier and missed you."

Guan Yu (Wan Hong) noted her arrival. Though intrigued by her Western-style dress, he disdained arrogant noblewomen. As she addressed only Jiang Xin and Chu Fan, he rose politely. "I'll take my leave. Enjoy your conversation."

"Wait!" Duan Ruxue interjected swiftly. "You must be the illustrious Wan Hong? Your exploits precede you. Jiang Xin's fortunate to have two exceptional gentlemen by her side."

"You misunderstand," Guan Yu clarified. "Miss Jiang and I are mere acquaintances. Her bond with Chu Fan is fated. Please don't misconstrue."

Duan Ruxue arched an eyebrow. Most men coveted Jiang Xin's beauty, yet Wan Hong distanced himself impeccably. Even her own charms seemed ineffective. "My apologies. I've long admired Chu Fan and Jiang Xin's union. As for yourself... might we become acquainted?"

Jiang Xin giggled. "Why so formal, Wan Hong? Making friends is good!"

Guan Yu's gaze drifted toward Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi nearby. "The honor is mine, Miss Duan," he conceded, recognizing potential benefits in befriending the powerful Duan clan.

**Chapter 4861: Arrogant Disregard**

"Your dress intrigues me," Guan Yu remarked. "Its design resembles my homeland's fashions. Did you create it?"

"Our seamstress's work. Her innovative designs please me greatly."

"Marvelous craftsmanship. Might I meet this artisan?"

"Certainly. Visit anytime." Duan Ruxue's response came smoothly, though Jiang Xin teased: "Interested in the seamstress? Is she beautiful?"

Guan Yu chuckled. "Were I seeking beauty, why look past the celestial vision before me?" His compliment flushed Duan Ruxue's cheeks.

Chu Fan interjected: "Wan Hong already has companions." He nodded toward Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi sampling desserts across the hall.

Following his gaze, Duan Ruxue observed the two women. Though Wan Hong's aloofness stung, his priorities became clear. She smiled enigmatically - this puzzle required solving.
