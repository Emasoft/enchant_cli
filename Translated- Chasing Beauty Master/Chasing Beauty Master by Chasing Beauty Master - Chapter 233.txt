“Guessing answers only earns five points—truly, how low has Guan Yu’s character sunk?”

After the jokes ended, the conversation turned serious: how to deal with Fu Lili, the informant.

“Boss, how do you plan to handle Fu Lili?” Wang Zhen asked, his voice thick with harshness.

When he first learned of the class informant, Wang Zhen had been furious. Now that he knew it was Fu Lili—who had a grudge against Guan Yu—his anger burned hotter.

Guan Yu glanced at him indifferently. “A five-point score is enough to make her the school’s laughingstock. My punishment ends here. As for the rest…you’re the class monitor. You decide.”

Wang Zhen paused, then said, “Thank you, Boss.”

As the leader of the boys’ faction and Wang Zhen’s superior, Guan Yu naturally wouldn’t overstep. Hence, Wang Zhen had sought his opinion.

But sensing Wang Zhen’s rage, Guan Yu handed him the final decision to placate him.

No one could blame Wang Zhen for his fury. He loved leadership and excelled at it. When the class united against Liu Gang’s schemes, only to be sabotaged by a classmate—Fu Lili—how could he not seethe?

Guan Yu nodded, curious. “How will you deal with her?”

Wang Zhen replied decisively, “Betraying the class means she’s forfeited her right to stay. I’ll spread word of her treachery. Under the scornful gazes of her peers, she’ll have no choice but to crawl out of this class—and this school.”

Surprise flickered in Guan Yu’s eyes.

He’d expected Wang Zhen to resort to violence. Instead, the plan was to erase her from their world.

Though ruthless, it revealed Wang Zhen’s resolve—a trait fit for greater ambitions.

Without Fu Lili and Liu Gang, the exams were trivial. Even without Guan Yu’s help, Wang Zhen elevated the class’s scores to unprecedented heights, earning schoolwide acclaim.

As for the suspiciously high marks? Everyone drew salaries here. No one pried.

Exams concluded Guan Yu’s first university semester.

Their arts school dismissed earlier than standard colleges. With nearly six weeks until Lunar New Year, Guan Yu decided to remain in N City until the holiday approached.

In N City, Guan Yu’s rise had been meteoric. Luo Cheng’s influence now spanned industries. A lab researching compact high-capacity energy storage had been established, with Li Xi recruiting talent nationwide. The foundation was laid.

Of course, professionals handled these matters, sparing Guan Yu direct involvement.

Yet his days remained uneasy. The “chess pieces” Wan Qianshan planted in N City haunted his thoughts. He spent weeks strategizing their removal.

“Brother Yu, what’s on your mind?” Luo Cheng asked, noticing Guan Yu’s distraction.

Since winter break began, Guan Yu occasionally visited Luo Cheng’s establishments—unlike Niu Le, who came solely to carouse. Now, Guan Yu sat drinking in a bar corner while Niu Le…vanished as usual.

“Ah…admiring the view,” Guan Yu joked, sipping his drink.

Luo Cheng nearly rolled his eyes. With the beauties in Guan Yu’s villa, barflies held no appeal. But he changed topics: “After absorbing those four minor gangs, our strength surged. I plan to build a five-star hotel and luxury club on their turf. Your thoughts?”

“You have full authority. Trust your judgment,” Guan Yu smiled.

Luo Cheng’s competence shone during the gang dismantling. Four specialized squads, flawless execution—Guan Yu had absolute faith.

“But…” Luo Cheng hesitated, not from overstepping—Guan Yu’s previous candor had dissolved all barriers between them.

“Spit it out. Trouble?” Guan Yu prodded.

Luo Cheng nodded sheepishly. “Rapid expansion strained our funds. For further growth…we need capital.”

Understanding dawned. “How much?”

“Thirty million upfront for the hotel and club.” Luo Cheng rubbed his hands, moved by Guan Yu’s implicit trust.

“Thirty million?!” Guan Yu blinked.

“Problem?” Luo Cheng tensed.

“Give me time.” Guan Yu massaged his temples. Li Xi’s lab already consumed promised funds. Now this?

“It’s urgent,” Luo Cheng pressed. “Yang Long, Zhou Jin, and Chu Hong eye our territory. Delay risks losing it.”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. “Them again.”

After a beat, he vowed, “You’ll have the money in three days.”

Relieved, Luo Cheng grinned. Thirty million meant liquidity to outmaneuver rivals.

“I won’t fail you,” he promised.

Guan Yu waved it off. “Where’s Niu Le?”

The wild Niu Le had skipped every exam. Only intervention from Liu Jun’s uncle—the education bureau director—kept him enrolled via administrative loopholes. Now he “enjoyed” N City’s delights before holiday confinement.

“Obsessed with gambling lately. Probably at the underground casino,” Luo Cheng shrugged.

“Underground casino?” Guan Yu perked up. “Explain.”

Luo Cheng straightened. “It’s a notorious N City hub. Daily, elites gamble fortunes there—a money-printing machine. Also…a laundry for dirty cash.”

Guan Yu frowned. “If it’s elite, why ‘underground’? Illegal?”

“A private club,” Luo Cheng clarified. “But exclusively for gambling.”

Pausing, Luo Cheng added meaningfully, “You’ll find the owner…interesting.”

“Chu Hong?” Guan Yu guessed.

Luo Cheng gaped. “How?!”

“Mainland bans gambling. Who else but the socialite could charm elites into such a den? Your ‘interest’ hint confirmed it.”

Luo Cheng applauded. “Brilliant.”

“If it’s hers,” Guan Yu worried, “is Niu Le safe?”

“She runs a business. Members play freely. Besides, she doesn’t know you’re watching. Niu Le’s fine.”

Guan Yu relaxed, then smirked. “Seems your thirty million might arrive early.”

Luo Cheng paled. “You’re visiting? Gambling’s risky! Even pros lose millions.”

Guan Yu stood, stretching. “Lead the way.”

Resigned, Luo Cheng obeyed, praying Guan Yu wouldn’t get hooked. Little did he know—Guan Yu’s detection system guaranteed wins.

The “underground” casino occupied a downtown palace of gilt opulence. Presenting VIP cards, they entered a hall rivaling Versailles—buzzing with N City’s elite: tycoons, powerbrokers, all gambling fortunes.

Guan Yu’s lip curled. *How many beds did Chu Hong warm to build this empire?*

He exchanged 10,000 yuan for chips. Luo Cheng relaxed—minimal loss risk.

“Go enjoy yourself,” Guan Yu dismissed him, wandering past poker tables.

Luo Cheng left to find Niu Le.

Guan Yu’s goal was twofold: probe Chu Hong’s operations and replenish funds. His detection system made card games child’s play.

Stopping at a baccarat table, he noted the rules—two cards each, third optional. Bets on banker, player, or rare 8:1 “tie.”

Amid jeers, someone placed 1,000 chips on “Tie.”

Guan Yu smiled. Tonight, probability would bend.
