The Second Prince continued, “The Crown Prince did not come after you but went directly to the Embroidered Uniform Guard headquarters. This suggests he lacks concrete evidence and currently has no means to act against you. Thus, I advise you to remain hidden for now. Avoid appearing in public and giving him any opportunity to exploit weaknesses.”

Minister Qi (Enterprise) nodded in understanding. After careful consideration, he concluded that most affairs within the Embroidered Uniform Guard had been properly arranged. His trusted subordinates were unlikely to betray him, so no significant issues should arise.

“This incident was likely orchestrated by the Crown Prince and His Majesty as a pretext to dismantle the Embroidered Uniform Guard,” the Second Prince declared.

“What do you mean by this?” Minister Qi inquired.

“How can you fail to grasp the obvious? After all your years by my side!” the Second Prince chided. “Since its inception, the Embroidered Uniform Guard has always been led by a high-ranking military commander of great merit—or even the Emperor himself. Yet now, its command has fallen to a civilian official like you. Do you not comprehend the implications?”

“This old minister is well aware. Are you suggesting His Majesty intends to reclaim the Guard’s authority?” Minister Qi countered.

“Precisely,” the Second Prince replied. “His Majesty likely senses mounting dangers and seeks to consolidate his power. This opportunity to weaken the Guard will not be overlooked.”

**Chapter 4967: Going Together**

“Your Highness, the Embroidered Uniform Guard is our faction’s backbone. Without it, we lose all leverage against our rivals. We cannot afford to forfeit such influence,” Minister Qi argued.

Minister Qi knew the Second Prince’s concerns were valid. Years ago, the Guard’s Commander had been his own son—a valiant general who had distinguished himself on the southern frontier at just sixteen. Trained in martial arts since childhood, his son had risen through merit to become Deputy Commander of the Guard, answering directly to the Emperor.

Leveraging his son’s prestige, Minister Qi had climbed from a minor sixth-rank official to his current position as Minister of Justice. His son’s relentless service in resolving critical cases had earned the Emperor’s deep trust—until a sudden, mysterious illness claimed his life within two months, baffling all imperial physicians.

Grief-stricken, the aging Emperor, moved by the family’s loyalty, granted Minister Qi full control over the Guard alongside his ministerial duties. Now, fearing instability after the recent breach of the imperial prison, the Emperor seemed poised to reclaim power—starting with the Guard.

Losing the Guard’s command after decades was unthinkable for both Minister Qi and the Second Prince.

“I fully grasp the severity of this,” the Second Prince said urgently. “Minister Qi, you must act immediately. The prisoners in the imperial jail cannot be allowed to live. Send your men to silence them—now.”

Minister Qi frowned. “But my agents can no longer access the prison. The Guard’s personnel are barred from entering.”

“Then we’ll enlist Chancellor Li’s aid. He has contacts there,” the Second Prince decided. “No—waiting is too risky. We’ll go to him directly. Out the rear gate, quickly!”

The Second Prince’s urgency stemmed from fear that tortured prisoners might divulge secrets. As they hastened to his carriage, Minister Qi offered, “My carriage is parked ahead.”

“No time for formalities,” the Second Prince snapped. “Ride with me. We go together.”

**Chapter 4968: The Auspicious Ornament**

Meanwhile, Chancellor Li brooded in his manor over recent setbacks—the botched assassination of Lord Cao and the Emperor’s fury. With the Cao family now accusing their allies, the Qin clan faced ruin, threatening the Second Prince’s faction. The arrest of Guard agents further destabilized Minister Qi’s position.

A guard rushed in. “My Lord! The Second Prince approaches with urgent business!”

“The Second Prince himself? How unusual,” Chancellor Li mused, quickly arranging a reception. Though senior to the prince, protocol demanded respect.

The golden-roofed royal carriage, infamous for its reckless speed through crowded streets, soon arrived. Alighting with Minister Qi, the Second Prince cut short pleasantries. “We’ve no time for courtesies. To your study—now.”

Chancellor Li’s opulent study astonished them. Lavish artworks and treasures cluttered the space, dominated by a massive golden dragon-turtle statue—a western “auspicious ornament” believed to attract fortune.

“Has this been consecrated?” the Second Prince asked, attempting to lift the shockingly heavy piece. “Such wealth exceeds a chancellor’s legitimate means. Your corruption is evident.”

Chancellor Li paled. “Your Highness jests! These are mere tokens of your past generosity—”

“This ‘dragon-turtle’,” the Second Prince interrupted coldly, “places the imperial dragon beneath a tortoise shell—a mortal insult to His Majesty. Its mere presence here justifies your execution.”

Trembling, Chancellor Li knelt. “I swear it’s only a goodwill charm! In its homeland, every household displays one!”

“Yet here,” the Second Prince hissed, “it symbolizes the Emperor cowering under a shell. Should this reach his ears...”

Minister Qi intervened, helping Chancellor Li rise. “We’re allies. This stays between us—provided you cooperate.”

**Chapter 4969: Misreading Intentions**

“But countless people own these ornaments!” Chancellor Li protested weakly.

“Commoners are irrelevant,” the Second Prince retorted. “You’re a high minister. His Majesty needs only pretext to destroy you. Dispose of this immediately.”

Realizing the danger, Chancellor Li acquiesced. “You’re right. I’ll have it melted down tonight.”

“See that you do,” the Second Prince warned. “Now—to urgent matters. The prisoners...”

As discussions turned to the imperial jail, Chancellor Li grasped his precarious position. The dragon-turtle’s discovery had handed his allies a lethal weapon—one requiring absolute compliance.
