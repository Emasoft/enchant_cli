“I never take things for free. I have no habit of accepting others’ possessions without effort. Let’s fight first.” The beggar refused outright, insisting on a duel despite being offered gold freely.

The small ingot produced by Steward Zhao was indeed smaller than the larger ones displayed behind—perhaps due to its meager size.

“Do not mistake me for a mere beggar,” the other party declared. “I’ve journeyed from afar without provisions, reduced to this state. When I found myself penniless and desperate, your arena appeared as if tailored for me. I shall compete to claim the gold.”

With the crowd watching, the steward had no choice but to oblige. If the beggar proved skilled, he would grant him gold after a fair match.

Master Zhao rose and approached, feigning benevolence. “Esteemed warrior, why trouble yourself? Accept the gold graciously. My servants are formidable. Why risk injury?”

“Even if I lose, I won’t take what isn’t earned,” the beggar replied staunchly. “Victory grants me rightful gold. Defeat sends me away empty-handed.”

Seeing his resolve, Master Zhao relented. A spectacle would entertain the crowd, and the gold mattered little.

Earlier, Axiong fought unarmed against bare-handed challengers. Now, as the beggar wielded a staff, the Zhao household deployed armed retainers to avoid disadvantage.

“A’Lang, spar with him—restraint is key,” Steward Zhao ordered.

A’Lang stepped forward, retrieving a spear from the weapon rack. Guanyu surmised he was versatile in arms, choosing the spear to counter the staff’s reach—longer weapons held the edge in balanced duels.

Compared to a wooden staff, the spear’s metal tip posed greater threat. A’Lang appeared competent, and Guanyu noted the Zhao family’s retainers were impressively trained.

Though A’Lang’s short stature made the spear seem unwieldy, Guanyu trusted his choice. The two faced off, the beggar gripping his staff, poised.

Wang Jun muttered, “Thank heavens I didn’t volunteer. A’Lang surpasses Axiong. Against him with weapons? I’d stand no chance.”

“The Zhao family pairs armed challengers with armed defenders,” Guanyu observed. “Unarmed opponents face Axiong. Fair enough—fighting unarmed against weapons would be unjust.”

A’Ze interjected, “But if I used my ritual brush as a weapon, would they deploy an armed opponent?”

“Unlikely,” Guanyu replied. “A brush isn’t a weapon. If they claim otherwise, it’d be absurd.”

“True. Let’s see how A’Lang fares. That beggar’s ragged but formidable,” A’Ze remarked.

Guanyu sensed faint inner qi in both combatants—either novices with meager reserves or masters concealing their strength. Likely the former, as profound cultivators were rare here.

Spear and staff clashed. The beggar struck first, his staff whirling overhead before smashing downward. A’Lang blocked firmly, unfazed, but staggered back from the impact.

After several exchanges, A’Lang slowed, outmatched. Guanyu noted the beggar held back, toying with him. Soon, A’Lang yielded defeat.

“He’s skilled,” Wang Jun admitted. “Even I couldn’t best him. Lady Zhao might struggle too.”

The beggar had boasted confidence earlier—now proven. As A’Lang retreated, Zhao Xue impatiently stepped forward, veiled and silent, bowing respectfully.

“Mistress, will you choose a weapon?” the steward asked.

“Unnecessary,” her melodic voice rang out. “Fighting bare-handed is concession enough.”

The crowd murmured—how could she face a staff unarmed? Yet Zhao Xue moved like drifting silk, evading every strike with preternatural grace. The beggar pressed fiercely, but she flowed around his attacks.

Growing impatient, he feigned exhaustion. Sensing opportunity, Zhao Xue lunged—only for him to pivot, thrusting his staff like a spear. The blow struck her shoulder, nearly knocking her off the platform.

Conceding defeat, she ordered, “Steward, grant him two ingots.”

The steward complied, though the marriage candidacy went unmentioned. The beggar thanked her, shouldered his staff, and departed.

“Why not claim candidacy?” A’Ze wondered. “With her beauty, why refuse?”

“Perhaps he’s wed already,” Guanyu mused. “He sought only gold for wine.”

Wang Jun sighed. “Who’d expect such skill in a beggar? This world’s cultivators aren’t to be underestimated.”

Guanyu reflected—while immortal cultivation dominated, martial artists like Zhao Xue excelled through arduous training. Yet most favored the easier path of qi refinement, extending lifespan without bodily strain.

Zhao Xue’s prowess was rare, born of personal dedication. As the crowd dispersed, the Zhao family’s reputation for formidable retainers—and their daughter’s unyielding spirit—lingered in the air.
