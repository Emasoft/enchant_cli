“Good friend…” Guan Yu chuckled and nodded repeatedly. Had they reconciled? He was genuinely surprised, feeling a mix of relief and unexpected joy.

He had assumed Mo Ling would despise him completely, yet she had unexpectedly taken the initiative to apologize and seek reconciliation.

Watching Mo Ling walk back to the dormitory, Guan Yu scratched his head and turned toward the school gates. However, he still didn’t understand Mo Ling’s temperament. Had he chased after her and seen her expression at that moment, he would have been startled.

Mo Ling, now puckering her petite face in irritation, snorted and rolled her eyes fiercely. “You stinker! Think hiding will save you from this lady’s wrath? Dream on! I’ll keep you steady first—the real show is yet to come!” she fumed inwardly.

How could a young maiden who’d been seen naked not be furious? Though Guan Yu wasn’t entirely to blame, letting this slide so easily? Not a chance!

**Chapter 119: The Great Ming Xuande Incense Burner**

Leaving campus, Guan Yu waited by the roadside for Bus Route 11 according to his prechecked route. The bus was sparsely occupied, and he took a window seat, tilting his head to study the route map. Over a dozen stops—this would take a while.

He pulled out his cheap 200-yuan phone and idly played Snake, the only semi-intellectual game it offered. After clearing seven or eight levels, the serpent grew too long and bit its own tail.

Distracted by the game, he soon arrived at the antique market. Behind the Guomao Plaza lay his destination: a bustling expanse teeming with flowers, birds, fish, insects, ancient artifacts, and paintings. Rows of antique shops flanked the street, though roadside vendors outnumbered the stores.

Without his detection ability, Guan Yu would never have engaged with antiques. Calligraphy, ancient paintings—all were mysteries to him. He wandered slowly between stalls.

In his view, items worth hundreds of thousands with quick resale potential were likely porcelain. Collectibles like bird-and-flower paintings required too much effort to match with buyers, and coin collections were out of the question. Even if he found valuable copper coins, locating buyers within two days would be difficult. Liquidation was paramount.

At every stall displaying porcelain bowls or jars, Guan Yu paused to activate his detection skill.

Though mentally prepared for the challenge—knowing 95% of market items were fakes, with genuine pieces priced near market value—he still hoped for a lucky find. “Picking leaks” meant acquiring undervalued treasures, demanding sharp eyesight and expertise he lacked.

After an hour of circling, Guan Yu found nothing valuable. Unlike other markets, vendors here sat idly smoking or polishing items, none bothering to solicit customers.

This wasn’t easy. Quick millions were a fantasy. Repeatedly using his detection skill wearied him—each activation required analyzing an item’s age and value.

Focusing on porcelain, he encountered a few genuine pieces but retreated upon hearing their prices. Sellers demanded sums exceeding his skill’s appraisals. Reselling would require finding specific buyers—a daunting hurdle.

“Enough… Time to refuel.” He bought a bag of chocolates and candies, stuffing his pockets. Chewing chocolate, he wandered to the market’s shaded northern section.

While inspecting a Republic-era porcelain bowl (worth under 10,000), Guan Yu glanced sideways and froze.

A male Guanyin statue? The figure bore a halo, stood on a lotus, and held a willow branch—but Guanyin was female!

“Interesting.” Abandoning the bowl, Guan Yu examined the statue. His detection skill revealed a Sui Dynasty artifact valued at 30,000–70,000. Why so low? Sui-Tang relics should fetch over 100,000.

Before the statue sat a grimy bronze incense burner, blackened by age or soot.

“Master, how much for this Bodhisattva statue?” Guan Yu asked casually.

The vendor glanced dismissively. “60,000—includes the incense burner.” He returned to his *Story Club* magazine.

60,000 matched his skill’s appraisal. Guan Yu activated detection on the burner—and his pulse quickened.

*Great Ming Xuande Incense Burner. Authentic. Value: 300,000–800,000.*

A treasure! This unremarkable burner was his golden ticket. Buying the male Guanyin meant getting the burner free—netting tens of thousands in profit.

Suppressing excitement, Guan Yu feigned ignorance. “Is this real? Not a replica?”

“Scram! Bought this from a village family! Know-nothing fool!” the vendor snapped.

Guan Yu persisted. “Can you lower the price?”

“Make an offer.”

“25,000?”

“You joking? I paid 50,000! Get lost!”

Guan Yu knew the vendor lied—he’d bought both items for 3,000. But a regular customer had offered 58,000. Time was critical.

“Wait—when do you close? I’ll get the money in two hours!”

“Till 5 PM. Hurry.”

“Keep it for me!” Guan Yu rushed off. Two hours to raise 40,000.

Lottery shops! He dashed across the commercial district.

At the first shop, he used detection on scratch tickets—2,000 yuan won. Next stop: 1,000 yuan. This pace wouldn’t suffice.

Desperate, he called Feng Xin.

**Chapter 120: Raising Funds**

“Xin-jie, I need to borrow 35,000. I’ll repay tomorrow!”

“Where are you?”

“Guomao’s antique market.”

“Wait there.”

Feng Xin excused herself from a business meeting. “We’ll resume tomorrow.”

**Chapter 121: Borrowing Money**

Guan Yu leaned against a tree, relieved she’d answered.

“Xin-jie, it’s urgent. I’m at the market’s main gate.”

Hanging up, he sighed. Borrowing grated on him—he needed sustainable income.

Feng Xin dismissed her clients. “Ta Long, host Manager Liu’s group. I have urgent matters.”

She strode out, heels clicking purposefully toward destiny.
