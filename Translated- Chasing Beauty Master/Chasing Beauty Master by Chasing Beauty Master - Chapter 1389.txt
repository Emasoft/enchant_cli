Yanzao said, “Master, if those two fox demons from the Soul Demon Sect can directly sense Miao City's location, there's no need for us to send disciples haphazardly searching elsewhere. The desert is perilous – we shouldn't risk our junior brothers' lives. I propose dispatching only our most capable and cunning disciples to secretly trail the Soul Demon Sect members. This way, we can accurately pinpoint Miao City's whereabouts.”

Xuanming had predominantly assigned disciples from Left Void Peak for this mission. Though reluctant, they dared not disobey their elder's command. Everyone understood the mortal dangers of the desert, yet the search for Miao City could not be abandoned.

“Our Cloud Azure Sect has no shortage of competent disciples,” mused another voice. “But this mission is doubly dangerous – not only must they brave the treacherous desert, but also shadow the Soul Demon Sect undetected. This is an exceptionally arduous task.”

Xuanming turned to Elder Lu. “What say you, Junior Brother Lu? How about sending Ma Xiao from your Front Return Peak? He's a seasoned disciple with considerable cultivation.”

Elder Lu's expression tightened. Though Ma Xiao was his most promising disciple, sect duties took precedence over personal preferences. The current Cloud Azure Sect differed greatly from its united past – now, constant rivalry brewed between peak elders, each vying for prestige through their disciples' achievements.

A disciple's competence reflected directly on their master's reputation. In these competitive times, none wished to risk their prized students on dangerous missions, preferring to keep them close for accelerated cultivation.

Yanzao interjected, “Master, since the recent Six Peaks Tournament concluded with four top disciples emerging from our younger generation, shouldn't we entrust this crucial mission to them? Sending others might prove... inadequate.”

Elder Lu's face flushed crimson as he pointed accusingly. “Yanzao! Are you implying my Front Return Peak's Ma Xiao is incapable? This is blatant provocation!”

Such boldness was unprecedented – openly questioning an elder's disciple risked grave offense. Yanzao hurriedly bowed. “Elder Lu, I meant no disrespect. Ma Xiao is undoubtedly exceptional, but Front Return Peak oversees vast farmlands and pastures. With his numerous responsibilities there, why burden him further with this mission?”

Seizing the offered pretext, Elder Lu nodded. “Sect Leader, Yanzao makes a fair point. Guan Yu and the other tournament finalists have rested sufficiently since their return. Their capabilities are undeniable.”

Xuanming stroked his beard thoughtfully. “While logical, Guan Yu remains in secluded punishment at the back mountains. Releasing him prematurely might cause... discontent.” All present understood the unspoken reference to Elder Xiang, still bedridden from Guan Yu's ruthless strike.

Elder Lu pressed, “Senior Brother, we must prioritize the greater good. If the Soul Demon Sect obtains the Eight-Drum Technique first, subduing the Demon Sovereign will become impossible. Surely Elder Xiang would understand this crisis transcends personal grievances.”

After contemplation, Xuanming conceded. “Very well. I shall personally explain this to Elder Xiang. Prepare to accompany me to Left Void Peak.”

As they departed, Yanzao hid a sly smile. Wang Xiaorong's scheme was complete – Guan Yu would likely perish in the desert, neatly eliminating a thorn in their side through demonic hands. Who accompanied him to death mattered not.

Meanwhile, deep in secluded cultivation, Guan Yu observed the stalemate between the Eight-Drum Technique's energy and its seal within his mindscape. Both forces waited motionless, like predators anticipating the first strike.

“Grandmaster Jiu,” he asked the dozing elder beside him, “what are our odds against the Soul Demon Sect in the desert?”

The wizened cultivator slowly opened his eyes. “Unpredictable. This isn't merely a two-party contest – other sects will likely intervene. Miao City's elusive nature adds further uncertainty. Victory requires both strength and fortune.”

Guan Yu nodded, withholding his knowledge of the fox demons' involvement. “Indeed, luck plays no small part.” Internally, he marveled at Wang Xiaorong's machinations ensuring his selection for this mission.

When Grandmaster Jiu suggested intervention to avoid the perilous task, Guan Yu refused with practiced fervor. “As Cloud Azure's disciple, I must answer duty's call! Justice for the realm demands no less than full commitment!”

The elder approved this apparent devotion, unaware of Guan Yu's secret agenda. Their discussion turned to cultivation philosophies until interrupted by approaching footsteps.

Chapter 3602: Feigning Illness (Part 1)

Guan Yu's prediction proved accurate – Xuanming and Elder Lu arrived at Left Void Peak, admiring its bamboo forests while approaching Elder Xiang's quarters. The Left Void disciples paled at their unexpected visit.

Elder Xiang, actually recovered, dramatically coughed beneath blankets when alerted to guests. “Sect Leader... honors this unworthy one...” he feigned weakness, playing the aggrieved victim to maximum effect.

After exchanging pleasantries, the visitors revealed their purpose. “We propose sending the tournament finalists, including Guan Yu, for this critical mission.”

Elder Xiang's face twisted, but Xuanming preempted objections. “Junior Brother, consider the greater picture. Should demons claim the Eight-Drum Technique, all our disciples' sacrifices would be in vain.”

Through gritted teeth, Elder Xiang conceded. The trio's carefully orchestrated persuasion left no room for refusal. As they departed, Guan Yu began final preparations, aware his dual loyalties would soon face ultimate testing in the shifting sands.
