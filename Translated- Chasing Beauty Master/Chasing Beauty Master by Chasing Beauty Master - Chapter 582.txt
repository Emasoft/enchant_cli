Just as the crowd was hesitating, someone suddenly shouted from within, "No!"

Everyone swiftly turned towards the speaker, only to discover it was none other than the sect leader's daughter, Huo Lingling!

"Lingling, do you realize what you're doing? Should a child like you speak out in such a solemn occasion?"

Despite her father's reprimand, Huo Lingling straightened her back without a trace of timidity. "I don't care! If you bully Brother Guanyu, I won't stand for it!"

Unable to contain his exasperation, Guanyu chuckled dryly. "Lingling, don't be willful. I'm not as weak as you think. Don't worry."

"But..." Huo Lingling glanced suspiciously at Enkes and Hu Xiaohai before whispering in his ear, "They're clearly targeting you. Can't you see? Brother Guanyu, don't be afraid—I won't let them succeed!"

As Guanyu entered his chamber, a dark silhouette appeared atop the wall—his father, Guan Xiao. "I intended this Soul-Devouring Powder for schemers," Guan Xiao mused with amusement, "yet this boy becomes the first to taste the crab. Climbing walls despite injuries... seems the wounds aren't serious." With that, he vanished into the night.

Entering his room, Guanyu stared bitterly at his swollen, bear-paw-like hand. "I thought home meant safety, yet disaster struck at my doorstep. Shouldn't have gone out today. Zhang Tian—I'll repay today's humiliation a thousandfold!" he vowed through gritted teeth.

Dragging his aching body to bed, exhaustion weighed heavy. Just as he lay down, a sudden recollection jolted him upright. "How could I forget!" He fumbled with swollen fingers to retrieve a cloth-wrapped object—the enormous Body-Tempering Serpent Flower from the mystic swamp.

"Ha! This monster's sheer size could fetch a fortune!" Guanyu chuckled greedily, though knowing his nature would never part with such a prize. Examining the bulbous root, he frowned. "Odd—the root's abnormally hard. What's inside?"

Attempting to slice it, his blade snapped. "Need sturdier tools," he muttered, scanning his weaponless room. "Father's study then. Hope he's asleep..."

As he rose, the door creaked open—Guan Xiao stood framed in moonlight. Guanyu hastily hid his mangled hand. "Father... still awake?"

"Just finished night practice. Came to check on the little thief who scales walls instead of using doors." Guan Xiao's knowing smile flushed Guanyu's ears crimson—the jig was up.

"Heh... how'd you know?"

"Think your tricks fool me? Explain yourself!"

Guanyu sighed—his father's bluntness unchanged. Before he could speak, Guan Xiao threatened: "Shall I inform your mother? She might... postpone your travels."

"You wouldn't!"

"Confess fully, and I'll keep secrets—even support your journeys. Men need tempering through hardship."

Reluctantly, Guanyu recounted the day's beating, omitting clan conflicts. Midway, memories surfaced—his father's past "training methods" involving hired thugs.

Later in Guan Xiao's study, hidden mechanisms revealed a vault containing three legendary swords. Testing the frostblade, Guanyu instantly froze solid. "Appearances deceive," Guan Xiao lectured, shattering the ice. "This Frostvein Blade requires Master-level cultivation. For now, take the Blackiron Sword."

As chapters unfolded—failed livestock pens, tribal conspiracies, and rain-drenched confrontations—Guanyu navigated political storms. When framed for lost prey during storms, tribal elders bayed for his execution until the chieftess intervened. "Let him redeem himself!"

Hunting through tempests, ambushed by rival tribes, rescued by unexpected allies—each trial hardened Guanyu. Through it all, the serpent flower's mystery gnawed at him. Returning home, he sought tools to unveil its secret, only to discover his father's hidden armory and ancestral legacy.

"Grandfather's blade..." Guanyu marveled, frost patterns shimmering. "One day I'll wield this properly." For now, the Blackiron Sword would serve—its unadorned edge belying dormant power, much like the youth himself.
