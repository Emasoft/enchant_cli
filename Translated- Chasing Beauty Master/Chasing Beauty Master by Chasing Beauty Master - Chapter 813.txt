“Hehe, Brother Li, you’re such a tease. I’m already an old pearl losing its luster. How could your youthful ‘hard truth’ enter this aging house of mine?” Yaoji (Enchantress) giggled shyly.

Feng Jiawei’s eyes widened as he stared at Yaoji. Though she called herself old, she appeared to be in her twenties—the prime of youth with all the right curves in all the right places.

“I prefer maturity,” Li Yuan said, attempting to grope her, but Yaoji deftly sidestepped. Clapping her hands, she spoke into her walkie-talkie: “Sisters, come out! Brother Li is here to choose.”

Over a dozen female students emerged from various rooms. Feng Jiawei’s eyes bulged further. He hadn’t expected Kaihuang’s “feng shui” to cultivate such dewy maidens—each one appetizing enough to make his fingers twitch with hunger. Leaning toward Li Yuan, he whispered, “Can these girls be taken out?”

Feng Jiawei preferred taking them elsewhere for fun. Having forgotten his “medication” today, he needed to retrieve his body-enhancing pills to fully enjoy the night.

“Should be possible. I recall Young Master Feng taking two last time,” Li Yuan replied, addressing Yaoji.

Yaoji nodded. “That’s because Young Master Feng offered the right price, and the girls were willing. I don’t interfere with their decisions—you can negotiate directly.”

“Perfect.” Feng Jiawei immediately embraced a tall, slender girl resembling a Barbie doll. “Little beauty, what’s your price for coming out with me?”

The blushing girl hesitated when a voice echoed from the stairwell: “Let her go. She’s mine.”

**Chapter 2062: Number Eleven**

Cao Jin approached, cigarette pinched between fingers. Number Eleven had been his choice last night—a satisfaction he intended to repeat.

“Brother Cao, surely you won’t steal a girl I’ve claimed? I saw her first,” Feng Jiawei said, masking fear with Li Yuan’s presence and Ma Hai’s backing.

“F*ck your mother! I spent last night with Eleven! You dare claim first dibs?” Cao Jin shoved Feng aside and grabbed the girl.

“Brother Cao, even when beating a dog, one respects its master. Are you spitting on my face?” Li Yuan blocked his path.

Though offended by being called a “dog,” Feng stayed silent as Li Yuan intervened.

Cao Jin looked down contemptuously. He’d chosen Eleven for her resemblance to Wang Ting, who’d recently bewitched him. Last night, he’d used Eleven as a substitute and now sought to take her out.

“Has your dog gone rabid without food?” Cao Jin sneered.

“You—” Feng began, but Li Yuan cut him off: “If you’re provoking me deliberately, know that while I’m timid, Brother Hai won’t tolerate my humiliation.”

“Brother Hai? Hah! Ma Hai? How terrifying.” Cao Jin forced a laugh, stroking Eleven’s cheek. “Fine. I’ll give Ma Hai face today. Take Eleven—I’m magnanimous.”

Cao Jin couldn’t afford to anger Ma Hai after already crossing Guan Yu. Compromise might forge an alliance against Guan Yu—Wang Ting’s conquest required patience.

**Chapter 2063: Severe Beating**

As Feng left with Eleven, Li Yuan remained in the VIP room with the unconscious Wang Jun. His hands trembled with anticipation as he unbuttoned her shirt—

The door exploded inward. Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo stormed in. “Li Yuan, you bastard!”

Wei lunged as Jia doused Wang Jun with water. Coughing awake, she discovered her disheveled state and Li Yuan fleeing Wei’s blows.

“Dare assault ME?!” Wang Jun roared. Despite her drunken haze, cultivator reflexes let her hurl Li Yuan against walls, pummeling him relentlessly.

“Stop! You’ll kill him!” Wei pleaded, receiving a bloody nose when Wang Jun mistook him for another attacker.

“Guan Yu’s here!” Jia Bo’s desperate lie halted her rampage.

**Chapter 2064: Your Days Are Numbered**

In the hallway, Yaoji feigned ignorance to Wang Jun’s accusations. “How could I know what happened, Young Master Wang?”

“Liar!” Wang Jun stormed out as Wei told the battered Li Yuan: “Find a stronger backer. Your days are numbered.”

Jia Bo thanked Yaoji later: “We owe you for alerting us.”

“We’re friends,” Yaoji demurred, her enchantress persona unwavering. Business thrived under Kaihuang’s shadow—no advertising needed when students spread the word.
