“You’re mistaken. Let me tell you—what your father fears most is losing you. That’s why he guards you so tightly. Your mother passed early, and you’re his sole reason to keep living. If you leave, he’d have nothing left to live for. Tell me—what meaning would his existence hold then?”

After hearing the Left Envoy’s words, Wang Xiaorong suddenly felt a deep sorrow, as if the weight on her shoulders had grown heavier. “Aunt Right Envoy, I understand all you’ve said. But the life I desire is one I must pursue myself. I too deserve happiness. Don’t you agree?”

“Of course you should have your own life. No matter what the Demon Lord does, yours must outshine his. My words aren’t meant to chain you to his side forever. I only ask that you yield to him occasionally. After all, you’re grown now—the time you can spend by his side dwindles each day. Why clash with him over trifles?”

“Aunt Right Envoy, I understand. Thank you for speaking so frankly. I promise that from now on, I’ll yield to him in all matters… except those concerning Guan Yu. As long as Father doesn’t move against Guan Yu, I’ll compromise on everything else.” Wang Xiaorong smiled, though her promise was as hollow as the wind.

For the Demon Lord and Wang Xiaorong, their sole conflict lay in Guan Yu. Conversations flowed smoothly until his name arose—then sparks flew. On this subject, their views would forever diverge.

The Right Envoy chuckled. “Hurry back now. I have matters to discuss with the Demon Lord and can’t keep you company.”

After dismissing Wang Xiaorong, the Right Envoy returned. The Demon Lord, head bowed, muttered without looking up, “Why bother lecturing a child? She’s young—it’s natural to be willful.”

“She’s no child. Stop coddling her. She’s grown into her own opinions and foresight, far from the clingy girl of a decade past. It’s time to let go.” The Right Envoy understood the turmoil in the Demon Lord’s heart—his dread of losing Wang Xiaorong. Such selfish fear was universal, but his ran deeper, forged by utter dependence on his daughter.

The Demon Lord shifted the subject. “Enough of this. Did you come for a reason?”

The Right Envoy nodded. “I heard you’ve tasked Santou to steal the Wanxiang Plate from the Red Lotus Sect. Are you certain? Given the Ten-thousand-year Fire Gu’s value, entrusting it to Santou worries me. If needed, I’ll go instead.”

**Chapter 3,888: The Theft**

“You’d fare worse. Santou is ideal—the Six-headed Wolf King imprisoned in the Red Lotus Sect’s Ten-thousand-year Ice Lotus is his clan leader. He’ll fight tooth and nail to rescue him, boosting our chances to secure the plate.”

“But if Nuwa falters, Santou’s capture would be trivial compared to losing the Fire Gu. Breaching the Ice Lotus again would prove impossible,” the Right Envoy cautioned.

“I’ve considered this. Yet we must risk it. Only Santou’s desperation gives us hope. He’s previously infiltrated the Red Lotus Sect and knows its layout. Could you outperform him there?”

The Right Envoy grasped the Demon Lord’s logic—Santou’s bond with the Wolf King would drive him beyond reason, a motivation she lacked.

“Moreover,” the Demon Lord added, “I’ve arranged aid for Santou. Once Yanzhao recovers, they’ll act together. Securing the plate seems feasible, but freeing the Wolf King from the Ice Lotus… that’s another matter.”

Though aware of the near-impossible odds, the Demon Lord sent Santou regardless—to exploit his agility and speed, traits perfect for thievery, if not combat.

“The Demon Lord’s foresight is peerless. This subordinate admires your wisdom,” the Right Envoy flattered.

After half a day’s journey, Wang Jun finally reached Zhouji City. He praised the prized steed gifted by Chief Lu—its stamina unmatched, racing nonstop without faltering, where ordinary horses would’ve collapsed.

The bustling streets teemed with merchants and wagons, befitting a hub of rare materials. Wang Jun’s priority was locating a Demon Soul Sect outpost—swiftly, before Minister Pang could erase evidence.

The covert signal Guan Yu provided, relayed by Wang Xiaorong, was the sect’s highest-tier passphrase. Wang Jun entered a teahouse, parched from travel. “Waiter—tea!” he called.

As the waiter served him, Wang Jun noticed a jade pendant at his waist—engraved with the sect’s tiger emblem. Casually, Wang Jun tested the signal: “Is the tea cool?”

“Patience—it’ll cool soon.”

“Only cool tea quenches thirst.”

“Hot water steeps leaves. Sir, please come inside.”

Led to a back room, Wang Jun met a shrewd old man who accepted his sealed letter addressed to “Guan Yu.”

“I’ll ensure this reaches the Young Master by nightfall,” the old man vowed.

When Wang Jun requested a signal flare, the man hesitated until bribed with gold. Securing the flare, Wang Jun rented a lavish three-bedroom suite for Guan Yu, Liu Yun, and her daughter.

Examining the flare’s manual, he marveled at its complexity—color-coded messages for warnings, aid,撤退, and assembly. Exhausted, he napped, assured of Guan Yu’s safety.

By nightfall, Guan Yu’s letter arrived at the Demon Soul Sect. Guards recognizing the name rushed it to Wang Xiaorong, whose constant tales of Guan Yu’s exploits had made him legendary within the sect.

Meanwhile, Wang Jun inspected the signal flare’s instructions. Each color held specific meanings: white for danger, green for aid, black/white for day/night warnings, blue for retreat, and yellow to summon officers.

“Impressive system,” he mused, “eliminating couriers for vast coordination.” Fatigue overtook him as he awaited Guan Yu’s arrival, confident in his friend’s prowess.

**Chapter 3,891: Generous Treatment**

Time flowed swiftly. In the sect, the delivered letter stirred anticipation—a chance to impress the Young Master. For within those walls, Guan Yu’s renown eclipsed even the Envoys. To serve him was an honor; to be remembered by him, a ladder to ascension.
