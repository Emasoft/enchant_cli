“Of course,” said Wang Xiaorong, “the Blood Wing Technique is considered a lower-tier art within the Demonic Sect—somewhat outdated, perhaps. Maybe the current Blood Lord hasn’t mastered it fully, or lacks the Blazing Heaven Furnace. Either way, it’s mediocre. Now that the Blood Lord of Darkblood Ridge has reemerged after years of dormancy, something significant must be brewing.”

“Then what makes the Soulfiend Hall—the most formidable branch of the Demonic Sect you mentioned—so powerful? Do they possess unique arts?” Guanyu asked curiously. Since Wang Xiaorong was both a Demonic Sect member and talkative, he seized the chance to learn more. Understanding their methods would aid future confrontations.

**Chapter 3363: Striking at the Slightest Disagreement**

Wang Xiaorong glanced at him mysteriously. “Why do you keep prying into matters unrelated to you?”

Guanyu flushed but pressed on. “It *is* related. My friend was captured by the Demonic Sect. I need to understand my enemy.”

“Then focus on Darkblood Ridge. Why ask about Soulfiend Hall? They didn’t take your friend.”

“Fair point.” Sensing her reluctance, Guanyu shrugged. “If you won’t speak of it, forget I asked.”

“It’s no secret—most in the jianghu know. Only fools like you remain clueless.” She smirked. “The Soulfiend Hall currently holds the greatest power among the Sect’s four branches. For years, their Demon Sovereign has sought to unify the Sect, but without locating the Eight-Sided Drum—a righteous faction’s treasure—the other three branch lords refuse submission.”

“Thus, the Demonic Sect remains fractured. The Demon Sovereign’s endless search for the Drum continues fruitlessly. Once found, the other branches would have no choice but to bow. Unification would follow swiftly.”

“With Soulfiend Hall’s dominance, the other branches grudgingly heed their orders. Open defiance risks annihilation. Yet those three have long nurtured secret ambitions—accumulating strength to break free and eventually conquer the Sect themselves.”

Guanyu pondered. They’d left Cloudspire Sect barely three days ago. Darkblood Ridge’s abduction of Xiaotong, coupled with their awareness of the Blazing Heaven Furnace in his possession, meant their entire journey was under surveillance. This peril had to be addressed.

Knowing Wang Xiaorong’s allegiance and her palpable hatred for righteous factions, Guanyu wavered in trust. If she lured them into a trap, all five would face mortal danger. Caution was paramount.

“Xiaorong… you’re from the Demonic Sect, aren’t you?”

“Figured it out? Not entirely brain-dead, I see.” She laughed openly.

Siqi sprang up, finger jabbing accusingly. “A Demonic Sect snake! No wonder you know so much. Had we followed you blindly, we’d be walking into their trap!”

“Must you bite like a rabid dog? Yes, I’m Demonic Sect—but not from Darkblood Ridge. How does that hinder rescuing your friend?”

“You’re all cut from the same cloth!” Siqi hissed, hand twitching toward her weapon.

Guanyu hadn’t expected Wang Xiaorong’s blunt admission. Even he felt doubts stirring now.

“If I wished you harm,” Wang Xiaorong countered coolly, “would I waste time here? Your two friends still wander freely. I could’ve struck when you separated. Are all Cloudspire disciples this irrational?”

Guanyu and Siqi stiffened. She’d known their identities all along. What game was she playing?

“Xiaorong,” Guanyu ventured carefully, “I sense no malice from you—at least toward us. Can I trust you to help save my friend?”

Doubt meant catastrophe. Not only Xiaotong’s life, but the Furnace itself hung in balance. Their mission to investigate the Demonic Sect had clearly been leaked—likely by a Sect spy within Cloudspire who knew about the artifact.

“Belief is your choice,” Wang Xiaorong said loftily. “I promised aid, and will honor it. Explanations won’t sway your distrust, so I’ll spare us both.”

“I trust you.” Guanyu met her gaze. “Our hopes rest with you. And I remember my debt.”

“Guanyu!” Siqi shouted. “How can you believe her lies? This is a trap!”

“What alternative do we have?” Guanyu retorted. “Without her, we’re lost. Use reason, Siqi. If she meant deception, why such elaborate theatrics?”

His faith in Wang Xiaorong prickled Siqi with jealousy. Yet with no better option, she relented.

Wang Xiaorong stood. “I’ve prepared thoroughly for this rescue. But if you doubt me still, back out now. Even I risk death at Darkblood Ridge. Do you think I relish this?”

**Chapter 3365: Deceived**

Guanyu nodded grimly. “Only Xiaorong knows Xiaotong’s whereabouts and the rescue plan. We’ve no choice but to rely on her.”

“Though suspicion lingers,” Wang Xiaorong said, “remember your promise once she’s safe.”

Siqi sat silent, deferring to Guanyu. Saving Xiaotong outweighed all else.

“I’ll keep my word,” Guanyu vowed.

“Good. Don’t disappoint me.” Wang Xiaorong glanced outside. “Dawn approaches. Let’s eat. Rest through daylight—we move tonight.”

“Tonight?” Aze protested. “What if Xiaotong’s in immediate danger?”

“Since when do rescuers storm strongholds in broad daylight?” she retorted.

Guanyu eyed her suspiciously—another meal request? Was she a professional freeloader?

Catching his look, Wang Xiaorong laughed. “Don’t fret. My treat—repayment for last night’s dinner.”

Guanyu touched his cheek, unnerved by her perceptiveness. Xiao Zhi perked up instantly. “Fantastic! I’m starving!”

“A lady shouldn’t pay,” Guanyu insisted stiffly. “My treat.”

“Oh, such gallantry!” Wang Xiaorong clapped. “Your words, not mine! To the feast!”

Guanyu felt stripped bare—her swift acceptance left no room for polite refusals. Xiao Zhi stared as if he’d gone mad.

As they descended, the inn stood empty. Wang Xiaorong’s shouts eventually roused a yawning waiter. Orders placed, they waited hungrily.

“Why’s the food taking forever?” Xiao Zhi groaned.

Wang Xiaorong studied Guanyu. “As Cloudspire disciples, has anyone here offended Darkblood Ridge?”

They exchanged glances. “No,” Guanyu lied. “Only I clashed with a Darkfur Fiend on Cloudspire’s slopes days ago. A master drove it off.”

“Darkblood agents infiltrated Cloudspire?” She arched a brow. “Your sect’s security is lacking for such a prestigious school.”

“Large sects breed complex management. I suspect Darkblood spies infiltrated long ago to gather intelligence.”

“Convenient excuse. All sects harbor dissenters ripe for manipulation.” Leaning closer, she asked, “Did your clash provoke Xiaotong’s abduction? Or… do you possess something they desire?”

Guanyu’s pulse quickened. She knew about the Blazing Heaven Furnace—and the Soulsever Blade and Imperial Seal he carried. Yet admitting this risked everything.

“Nothing comes to mind,” he lied smoothly. “We’re mere junior disciples. What could they want?”

Wang Xiaorong’s smile said she saw through the deception. “Strange. Darkblood doesn’t act without purpose. Reconsider carefully—what else might they seek?”

Xiao Zhi blurted, “They’re just harassing us! No deeper scheme!”

**Chapter 3366: Primary Objective**

Unaware of the Furnace’s significance, Xiao Zhi and Aze nodded agreement.

“Perhaps.” Wang Xiaorong rose. “Eat and rest. We depart at nightfall.”

Post-meal, the group dispersed to sleep—except Guanyu and Siqi, who stayed to strategize. Wang Xiaorong slipped away.

Her true identity? Soulfiend Hall’s young mistress, the Demon Sovereign’s only child. Sent to intercept Guanyu, her mission: seize the Blazing Heaven Furnace before Darkblood Ridge could use it to dominate the Sect.

Riding beyond the city, she met a spy disguised as an inn attendant. “The Sovereign’s orders: prevent Darkblood from obtaining the Furnace at all costs. Eliminate Guanyu if possible. If not, gain his trust and strike when guard drops.”

“Tell Father I require no reminders,” she snapped before galloping off.

Alone by the Qijiang River, Wang Xiaorong grappled with conflicting loyalties. Her father’s commands clashed with growing fondness for Guanyu—an entanglement as dangerous as the rushing currents below.
