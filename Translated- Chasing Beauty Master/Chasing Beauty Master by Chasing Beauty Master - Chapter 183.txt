Guan Yu’s previously indifferent expression darkened ominously. He took two steps forward, his icy gaze fixed on the woman as he growled, “I despise men who hit women. But for those who don’t act like women, I’ve never had sympathy.”

*Slap.*

A crisp slap echoed through the club’s grand hall. A vivid handprint bloomed on the woman’s heavily powdered cheek.

Clutching her swollen face, she screamed maniacally, her features twisting with rage. “I’ll kill you!”

She lunged at Guan Yu, fingers clawing toward his face. But before her nails could graze him, another sharp *crack* resounded.

Guan Yu backhanded her other cheek with even greater force. The woman staggered back, disoriented, her eyes wide with terror. The two decisive strikes had cowed her completely.

As tensions peaked, the club manager strode over in stiletto heels, her tone coolly authoritative. “Gentleman and lady, I must ask you to comply with our policies. Further disturbances will result in revoked memberships.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow in mild surprise. Unlike typical managers who groveled to appease wealthy patrons, this woman showed no deference, despite the high-profile clientele.

*Perhaps only an entity like Yusheng Group could afford such boldness,* he mused, clicking his tongue.

The man’s face flickered with suppressed fury. Knowing this wasn’t territory for reckless behavior—not even toward a mere manager—he snarled, “I demand justice! This bastard struck my woman in front of me. You think I’m invisible?”

The manager replied impassively, “Personal vendettas must be settled outside. We can provide a private space, but you will not disturb other guests.”

Guan Yu sniffed lazily. “No time for fools. My friend needs her spa session.”

The manager’s gaze briefly swept over him, then froze when it caught the glint of a gold card in his hand. Her pupils contracted. She hurried to his side, professional smile blossoming. “Sir, may I examine that card?”

Puzzled, Guan Yu handed it over.

The manager’s demeanor transformed. Reverently holding the card, she inspected its embossed Yuan character on the back. Her posture bent deeper in respect as she returned it. “These three ladies are your guests? They may access *all* services immediately.”

“All services?” Lin Lin gaped. “Even the Imperial-tier treatments?”

The manager nodded. “Yes.”

Lin Lin inhaled sharply, eyeing Guan Yu with newfound awe. He shrugged, unsurprised. The card’s power had always existed—it simply required someone competent to recognize it.

The slapped woman stared blankly; her companion’s jaw hung slack at the manager’s sudden deference.

“Manager Li!” the man protested. “Don’t be fooled by some fake card! This idiot didn’t even know to present membership earlier. How could he qualify for Imperial-tier—”

Li cut him off coldly. “As manager, I recognize our Platinum-tier cards. This is reserved for Chairman Gu’s inner circle.”

*Platinum-tier?* The crowd gasped as one, stunned stares boring into Guan Yu.

**Chapter 452: Green With Envy**

Guan Yu sprang from the leather sofa. “Lead the way.”

They rushed to a lavish chamber dwarfing his previous room—a central marble bath surrounded by Tang dynasty ceramics and Song-era scrolls. But Guan Yu ignored the opulence, zeroing in on the asthma victim.

Three women in sheer white robes huddled around Mo Ling, who lay gasping on the floor. Lin Lin cried, “You said you know medicine! Help her!”

Nodding, Guan Yu assessed Mo Ling: labored breathing, drenched in sweat, face crimson. Activating his diagnostic system, his expression morphed to horror seconds later.

“Remove all flowers!” he barked at Manager Li, who vanished to comply.

Dropping to his knees, he yanked open Mo Ling’s robe. Her nude form spilled into view—peaked breasts, bare triangle below. Guan Yu swallowed hard. *Why no undergarments?!*

Steeling himself, he placed one hand on her left breast, another below her neck. The ancient coin in his mind began to glow—**Treatment System** blazing. Cool energy flowed through his arms into her body, one stream soothing airways, another steadying her racing heart.

Sweat beaded his brow; his hands trembled by the fifth second. Yet he held firm until her breathing eased and color normalized.

“Stable now,” he panted, pale but smiling... until his gaze drifted downward again. *What a masterpiece of flesh.*

Mo Ling’s shock curdled to rage. “You *pervert*!” Her slap sent him stumbling backward—directly into Manager Li.

As both tripped toward the bath’s edge, Guan Yu grabbed Li’s robe. It tore away, leaving her plunging into water in black lace lingerie—translucent underwear revealing dark curls beneath.

Dripping wet, Li snatched back her robe under Guan Yu’s stunned stare. “Enjoy the view?” she hissed, cheeks flaming.

“You... degenerate!”

Lin Lin doubled over laughing. “Little brother, if I were male, I’d be *green with envy* right now!”

**Chapter 453: Never Enough**

“But color me impressed,” Lin Lin teased later. “You actually cured her asthma. Can you fix *anything*?”

Guan Yu grinned. “More or less.”

“Still bragging, but I’m starting to believe.”

Mo Ling, now re-robed, glared tearfully. “Why... why did you touch me *there*?!”

“Your heart rate was critical,” Guan Yu explained. “Needed direct contact. You felt the warmth stabilizing it, yes?”

“And lingering five extra seconds post-cure?” Lin Lin interjected. “Pure appreciation?”

Guan Yu shot her a murderous look.

“Regardless,” Manager Li interrupted, “we should leave. Mo Ling’s allergy—”

“Unnecessary,” Guan Yu said. “The flowers caused it. They’re removed.”

As the women resumed their spa day, Lin Lin called after his retreating figure: “Leaving so soon? Didn’t get your fill of views!”

Alone later, his phone rang. “Jiejie,” he smiled, hearing Liu Shilei’s voice. “Miss me?”

“You’ve been in Beijing weeks without calling!” she chided.

“Returning soon,” he murmured. “I’ve missed you terribly.”

The line hummed with unspoken tenderness as distant laughter echoed from the bath—a cacophony of chaos, desire, and life clinging stubbornly to its vivid course.
