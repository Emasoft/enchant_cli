“They truly wish to do so, but even against our Ha Clan, such methods prove futile. Their martial artists are mere scarecrows before us—we can obliterate their frontlines in moments, leaving their rear-positioned cultivators no time to cast spells.”

After hearing Hadabei’s words, Ling Su finally understood. Even if the Jiayi Sect had cultivators, they were surely no masters. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be so easily crushed. Had there been true experts, a few instant spells would have rendered those hulking warriors incapable of evasion.

**Chapter 4504: Astonishment**

The Ha Clan revered strength, but Ling Su wondered about their speed. If they were swift too, they’d truly be the bane of cultivators.

By nightfall, the Ha Clan’s chieftain returned. Mazhagen brought Ling Su to meet him. Upon seeing the chieftain, Ling Su was startled. He had assumed Mazhagen, as the chieftain’s son, inherited his robust build from a towering, muscular middle-aged father. Instead, the chieftain was a short, rotund old man resembling a fleshy sphere, with a snow-white beard, a gleaming bald crown, and sparse white hairs at his nape. Despite appearing at least seventy or eighty, he exuded vigor and vitality.

Ling Su deduced the chieftain must have been a wrestler in his youth—how else would he have developed such a corpulent frame?

Mazhagen spoke first: “Father, this is Ling Su, a dear friend and formidable cultivator.”

“Greetings, Chieftain.” Ling Su bowed courteously.

Earlier, Mazhagen had given the chieftain three silver ingots—sixty taels in total—provided by Ling Su. Though the Ha Clan dwelled in the desert with little use for silver, it remained vital for purchasing necessities in the wider world.

Pleased by the silver, the chieftain greeted Ling Su warmly: “Welcome, young friend. Mazhagen is fortunate to have such companionship.”

“Thank you, Chieftain. This is my first visit to the Ha Clan, and I’m deeply impressed by your people’s prowess. Though you appear advanced in years, your robustness reflects the Ha Clan’s essence,” Ling Su flattered.

“You speak truly. Can you guess my age?” the chieftain inquired, amused.

Ling Su scratched his head. “You seem between sixty and seventy. Am I right?” The chieftain’s white hair, beard, and baldness suggested such an age—though he and Mazhagen looked more like grandfather and grandson than father and son.

The chieftain chuckled. “I am one hundred and twenty-seven years old. To hear you say sixty... ha! I’m delighted to appear so youthful!”

“What? That age?” Ling Su gasped. For a non-cultivator to live so long was nearly unheard of.

Mazhagen confirmed: “Father doesn’t jest. He truly is one hundred and twenty-seven.”

“Incredible! I thought only cultivators extended their lifespans through cultivation. How does your clan achieve such longevity?” Ling Su marveled.

“Indeed, our Ha Clan boasts the longest-lived ordinary folk. Many elders surpass two centuries—it’s no rarity here,” Mazhagen replied.

The chieftain added: “Cultivators may live centuries, but we Ha people are exceptional. We revere strength yet outlive all ordinary folk. Even Mazhagen here is nearly sixty, though he appears as young as you.”

Ling Su nodded, awestruck. The Ha Clan’s vitality defied logic. Cultivators relied on spiritual energy, but these non-cultivators achieved similar longevity. Ling Su suspected their secret manual—the one the Jiayi Sect coveted—might grant both strength and extended life. No ordinary manual would provoke such greed.

Mazhagen, appearing a robust thirty, could pass as Ling Su’s grandfather. The clan’s secrets were undeniable.

“Your clan astounds me, Chieftain. At your age, you could easily live centuries more,” Ling Su remarked.

“Ha! I don’t seek endless years—only my clan’s prosperity,” the chieftain laughed, basking in the praise.

Ling Su pressed: “Cultivators prolong life through spiritual energy, common knowledge even among laymen. But your clan’s longevity baffles me.”

**Chapter 4505: Ulterior Motives**

“Young friend, our clan holds many secrets—some beyond sharing, even with Mazhagen’s comrades,” the chieftain stated. “I hear you plan to aid Hadabei against the Jiayi Sect tomorrow?”

Ling Su realized obtaining the manual would be difficult; the aged chieftain remained sharp. “Yes. Honored to assist against those marauders.”

“Good. Your cultivation skills will bolster our efforts. Their sorcerers often thwart us. With you, success is likelier.”

“I’ll contribute what I can,” Ling Su vowed, increasingly coveting the manual. Strengthening his physique could let him rival his nemesis, Guan Yu—a dual cultivator of martial and magical arts. Time favored Guan Yu’s growth, whereas Ling Su’s progress stagnated. The Ha Clan’s secret might bridge that gap.

By enhancing his body, Ling Su could become a dual cultivator himself. But haste bred recklessness. He’d bide his time, earning the clan’s trust through service.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s party trekked through endless dunes, finding only stubborn weeds amidst the sands. “The Mohist Sect supposedly came this way, yet we see no traces,” Guan Yu grumbled.

Mounted on camels, the group conserved energy despite the monotony. Siqi, riding beside him, noted: “Strong winds erase tracks. Missing traces is normal.”

Guan Yu conceded. “We wander blindly. Even correct direction offers no guarantee.”

Ahead, Wangjun pointed left. “Look there!”

Under clear skies, a distant group moved across the dunes. Guan Yu urged pursuit. “Speed up! Let’s investigate.”

The strangers matched their course, maintaining distance. As dusk fell, Guan Yu’s group closed in, but the others accelerated. Navigating treacherous dunes and avoiding quicksand—deadlier than swamps—they pressed on until Wangjun spotted structures ahead. “Another settlement!”

Unlike the Ha Clan’s tents, these lacked a central tower. Guan Yu hesitated. “Rest here. We’ll approach at dawn.”

Exhausted, they camped on a high dune, safe from the encroaching winds and hidden perils below.

**Chapter 4506: Discovery**

Quicksand lurked in depressions, capable of swallowing men within breaths. Guan Yu remembered tales of desert beetles infesting such traps, devouring trapped victims. Staying atop dunes minimized risks.

Wangjin’s keen eyes spotted movement. “Something’s ahead!”

After a day’s chase, the distant figures had led them to another tribal encampment—denser than the Ha Clan’s, yet unfamiliar. Guan Yu yearned to investigate, but darkness and fatigue dictated caution.

“We’ll rest here,” he decided. Safety preceded curiosity. The night wind howled, veiling the unknown in sand and shadow.
