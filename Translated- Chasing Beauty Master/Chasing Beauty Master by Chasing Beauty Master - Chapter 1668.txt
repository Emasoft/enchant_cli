“In that case, this seems quite fitting. Since borrowing money is possible, Lin Chen felt he could afford to take bigger risks. If things went south, he could simply borrow more.

The dealer shook the dice cup and habitually called out, ‘Final bets! Place your wagers quickly!’

Lin Chen smiled and said, “I’ll bet this round too. If you think my luck’s rotten, you can sit this one out and watch how I win.”

“What a joke! Since when have I feared losing money?” the woman screeched. “Not only will I bet, I’ll bet heavier! This round’s definitely Small! I’m betting Small! Small’s guaranteed!”

As she spoke, she shoved her silver forward—a staggering fifty taels. Lin Chen’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. Even for a bet, this was excessive!

After placing her wager, the woman turned to Lin Chen and sneered, “What’s wrong, chubby? Scared to bet? Can’t handle this much silver? Pathetic! All that earlier bravado was just an act, huh?”

“I’m simply patient,” Lin Chen retorted haughtily. “This paltry sum means nothing to me.” Having earlier boasted about being a low-key wealthy man, he couldn’t afford to lose face now.

Producing his money pouch, Lin Chen counted nine remaining gold ingots—his entire fortune gifted by Guan Yu. After deliberation, he decided against betting everything at once. Losing it all would spell disaster.

Settling on two ingots, he placed them down—enough to avoid the woman’s disdain.

“Well now! Quite the lavish spender, aren’t we?” the woman praised. “Good show, chubby! Knew you had spine.”

“Merely pocket change,” Lin Chen airily replied, adopting an aristocratic demeanor. “Just passing time with trivial amusements.”

“Splendid! I adore befriending the wealthy,” the woman declared. “Let’s play to the end today and make a killing! Stick with me, and I’ll guarantee your winnings.”

As she spoke, the dealer revealed the dice—two, three, three. Eight points: Small.

“Hahaha! Knew it was Small!” The woman’s shrieks made Lin Chen’s ears ring. “Follow my lead, everyone! Let’s empty this den today!”

Though her voice grated, Lin Chen’s mood lifted. Winning two ingods nearly recouped his losses—one more victory would break even.

Newcomers who had bet Big grew cautious after witnessing the outcome. The woman glanced at Lin Chen. “Betting so little? Running dry or losing nerve?”

“Testing the waters,” Lin Chen pontificated. “After last round’s thrashing, caution’s prudent. This game’s fickle—once losses start, they cascade. The key is staying level-headed.”

He spoke with the gravitas of a seasoned philosopher.

“Then don’t follow my bets!” the woman challenged. “I’ll bet Big this round—you take Small. Let’s see who’s right.” Her contemptuous look implied, *Dare you?*

Lin Chen froze. He’d planned to ride her coattails to victory, but her sudden provocation left him stranded. The crowd’s eyes bored into him—this born troublemaker now faced his moment of performative bravado.

Reluctant to fully antagonize his golden goose, Lin Chen yielded. “Why so serious, beauty? We’re here for fun!” He forced a grin. “You’re the expert—I’m still recovering losses. Shouldn’t you share your luck?”

“Exactly!” chimed the elderly man who’d borrowed money earlier. “Winnings taste sweeter shared!”

**Chapter 4362: Unprovable**

Though smiling, Lin Chen inwardly cursed. This wretched woman now targeted him! Despite his gold making him a veritable young master, her disdain stung.

“If you recognize my skill, bet heavier!” the woman snapped. “Last round, my lone bet outweighed yours combined. Where’s the excitement? If I lose, my losses dwarf yours—yet you’d still complain!”

“Enough! If you keep betting peanuts, I’m leaving.” She sat back down. “Few more rounds to pad your purses, then I depart.”

Shoving half her silver onto Big, she declared, “All in!”

Panicking at her impending exit, Lin Chen gritted his teeth and tossed five gold ingods—his entire stake. Victory would recoup losses and fund Siqi’s gift. If lost... well, he’d borrow from the backroom. By tomorrow’s departure, collectors would find empty air.

“Final bets!” The dealer lifted the cup.

“Big! BIG!” The woman’s piercing shrieks forced Lin Chen to cover his ears. Most bet heavy on Big, though some newcomers stubbornly chose Small.

Dice games thrived on simplicity—three dice summed determined Big (11-18) or Small (4-10). Triples meant dealer sweep. Lin Chen dismissed rumors of dice-hearing adepts—unproven fantasies.

“BIG! BIG!” The woman’s voice pierced through Lin Chen’s hands. Peeking at the reveal, he saw a six first.

“HA! First die’s six—certainly Big!” he crowed. The second die showed three. “Six and three! Inevitable!”

The woman stopped shouting, smugly awaiting victory—only a one on the third die could ruin this.

“Listen up!” she suddenly announced. “From now, followers must tithe me 10% winnings. Fair, no?”

“Brilliant!” Lin Chen endorsed. “Our goddess deserves tribute!” His enthusiasm met silent stares—the crowd eyed him like a fool.

**Chapter 4363: My Victory**

Reality struck—while the woman profited, others kept losing. The elderly borrower sighed, “Let me recover losses first...”

“One! Three! Six! Ten points—Small!” The dealer’s call detonated the room.

The third die’s cruel one obliterated hopes. Lin Chen gaped, knees buckling. Five ingods—gone.

“IMPOSSIBLE!” The woman shot up. “I heard Big!”

“You guaranteed Big!” Lin Chen accused.

“Screw off! I lost more!” she retorted tearfully. “You chose to bet heavy—your funeral!”

“You provoked me!”

“Did I hold your hand? If I told you to die, would you?”

As they bickered, the dealer reset. Lin Chen’s remaining four ingods mocked him. *Damn shrew!* he seethed. *Without her taunts, I’d never have...*

Tomorrow’s departure offered escape from debts, but Guan Yu’s wrath awaited if discovered. Desperate, Lin Chen resolved to trust his own luck henceforth—even if it meant borrowing from loan sharks later.
