“Rest assured, Miss Yang specifically arranged for me to care for her. You can trust me completely. The patient’s condition is stable. We recently took X-rays, and her recovery is progressing well. Her illness simply requires peace and rest to heal quickly.”

“That’s good to hear,” Guan Yu nodded. After the doctor left, Auntie smiled and said, “Guan Yu, you’re so busy—there’s no need to visit me so often. I’m doing much better now. In fact, I can already walk on my own.”

“Please don’t stand on ceremony, Auntie. It’s no trouble. Besides, your leg condition still needs my treatment to recover faster,” Guan Yu replied warmly.

At that moment, Auntie noticed Qu Shuangshuang bouncing around and gently chided, “Shuangshuang, this is a hospital. Don’t disturb others with your jumping.”

Qu Shuangshuang paused, her eyes widening as she admired Xue Jing’s beauty. “I’m just excited to see Brother Guan Yu!” she chirped.

“Brother Guan Yu, who is this stunning lady beside you? She’s so pretty!” Qu Shuangshuang asked after hopping off the hospital bed.

Xue Jing, sensing the girl’s familiarity with Guan Yu, decided to assert herself before he could speak. “Little sister, I’m your Brother Guan Yu’s wife. You’re quite lovely yourself—such a fresh-faced beauty is rare!”

Qu Shuangshuang’s eyes widened. *His wife?* She recalled seeing photos of several women from Qiaoyuan District on Ling’er’s phone during Guan Yu’s last visit. Though their images had already stunned her, the real Xue Jing surpassed even those pictures. She’d assumed the photos were heavily edited, smoothing skin to an eggshell-like perfection. Yet here Xue Jing stood, flawless and radiant, her complexion every bit as immaculate as in the images.

The realization sank in: the women of Qiaoyuan District were on an entirely different level. Though Qu Shuangshuang had once hoped to become Guan Yu’s woman, the gap between them now seemed insurmountable. Xue Jing’s pointed declaration carried subtle hostility, and Guan Yu could only sigh inwardly at the familiar undercurrent of rivalry.

Auntie studied Xue Jing with admiration. “Such a beautiful girl! You and Guan Yu make a perfect pair.” The compliment inadvertently lowered Qu Shuangshuang’s spirits, her smile dimming.

“Let me focus on treating your leg, Auntie,” Guan Yu interjected. “We’ve delayed a few days since the last session. Today’s treatment will be thorough.”

Xue Jing tactfully stepped aside as Guan Yu channeled his inner energy, hands moving over Auntie’s legs. Though the process brought excruciating pain—enough to make Auntie consider giving up during previous sessions—the remarkable results always justified the agony. As warmth spread through her muscles and blood flow improved, she clenched her teeth, focusing on the healing to come.

“Are you Sister Xue Jing?” Qu Shuangshuang asked during the treatment, surprising the older woman. “How do you know my name?”

The girl showed her phone. “Sister Ling’er shared these photos with me. I saved them—she told me all your names.”

Xue Jing recognized the images from a year prior, when Guan Yu had driven Yang Conghan’s car for Meimei’s wedding. “These are outdated,” she laughed. “I look different now.”

“You’re even more beautiful in person!” Qu Shuangshuang marveled. “Are all Brother Guan Yu’s wives this stunning?”

“We’ve grown accustomed to each other,” Xue Jing deflected. “First impressions might be startling, but familiarity dulls the edge.”

Undeterred, Qu Shuangshuang pressed, “How do you all avoid jealousy? With so many women around him...”

Xue Jing sidestepped neatly. “You’re too young for such concerns. Focus on your studies.”

“I’m not a child!” Qu Shuangshuang declared boldly, loud enough for Guan Yu to hear. “I want to become Brother Guan Yu’s woman too. We might end up living together!”

The brazen declaration hung in the air. Since that night before her sister Meimei’s wedding—sharing a heated bed with Guan Yu—Qu Shuangshuang’s thoughts had strayed to him constantly. Even now, facing Xue Jing’s superiority, her resolve held firm.

Xue Jing’s composure wavered. “Why him? What do you see in that man?”

“We’ve already slept together,” Qu Shuangshuang dropped casually, nearly knocking Xue Jing sideways.

Though the truth was less scandalous—mere proximity during a crowded family gathering—the younger girl’s phrasing invited misunderstanding. Xue Jing steadied herself, accustomed to Guan Yu’s entanglements.

“When did you two marry?” Qu Shuangshuang needled, sensing weakness.

“We’ve lived together for years,” Xue Jing countered. “Marriage isn’t feasible with his responsibilities. All the women in Qiaoyuan District understand this.” The subtext was clear: *Seek elsewhere if you want vows.*

“I don’t need vows—just feelings,” Qu Shuangshuang retorted defiantly.

As Guan Yu finished the treatment, Qu Shuangshuang rushed to towel her mother’s sweat-drenched face. “Clean up and change her clothes,” Guan Yu instructed. “We’ll wait outside.”

In the corridor, Xue Jing rounded on him. “You heard everything. Explain.”

Guan Yu scratched his neck. “It wasn’t like that. Their house was overcrowded that night—we shared a room, but nothing happened. With her sister there...”

“Her sister?” Xue Jing’s voice sharpened. “The one who married the next day? You played with both?!”

“No! Just sleeping—literally! Even if I’d wanted otherwise, Meimei would’ve stopped it!”

Xue Jing searched his face. “That girl claims otherwise.”

“She’s young! Misinterprets things!”

“Nothing at all?”

“Well...” Guan Yu faltered. “Minor... very minor interactions. Nothing serious.”

Xue Jing sighed. “I believe you. Seems she’s the persistent type.”

Their conversation paused as Qu Shuangshuang emerged, all smiles. “Brother Guan Yu, let me treat you to lunch! To thank you for helping us.”
