Chapter 1131: Acknowledging Faults

Unnoticed by all, Guan Yu had already intercepted Bao. With ghostly stealth, he leapt into the air, his wrist flicking as he guided the leopard to land steadily by his side.

Guan Yu declared solemnly, "Casually attacking others—is this the upbringing of your Three Great Sects? I thought disciples of reclusive sects would possess some uniqueness, but it seems...well...I’ve been enlightened."

Though his voice remained calm, thunderous echoes reverberated in the ears of the three opponents. The surrounding onlookers showed no reaction.

"Guan Yu, let it go..." A shadow crossed Bao's eyes. Despite his prestigious position in the Dragon Group wielding formidable authority, he knew challenging Liu Rushi was beyond his station, prompting him to seek peace.

"Tsk...Insects should know their place. After offending me, you think to brush this aside? When I say I’ll cripple your spiritual roots, I mean it. If you leave unscathed today, how shall I, Liu Rushi, retain face? Yan Feng, Yan Fa—act now. I’ll bear all consequences." Liu Rushi's face twisted with malice, pressing his advantage as Bao retreated.

"Unwavering resolve? Let’s see you uphold your boast today." Guan Yu's brow furrowed slightly. Their original purpose here had been to invite Carefree Sect members to discuss the upcoming Dharma Assembly. Though Bao chose concession, Guan Yu now saw the truth: gentle steeds get ridden, kind men get trampled. He stepped forward, spine straightening as his aura erupted.

"Hmm...Spirit Severing Stage? We can’t let you live." Yan Feng and Yan Fa's expressions shifted. They shot forth like loosed arrows, their footwork ethereal as they closed in with coordinated precision.

"Tsk...Playing the fool? Not every pig gets such fortune. Ah, the Carefree Void Palm—your coordination improves, Senior Brothers." Liu Rushi feigned composure, sneering at Guan Yu while chatting idly with fellow disciples, confidence unwavering in his comrades.

"Planning to crush us with overwhelming force? The Carefree Sect disappoints...Lin..."

Guan Yu's pupils contracted. The celestial movements of Yan Feng and Yan Fa unfolded before him like frames in a recording, every detail captured and replicated. As he analyzed their tactics, his hands formed the Immovable Vajra Seal. With a thunderous shout—

The duo's fluid movements froze mid-stride. Blood sprayed from their mouths as their bodies locked in paralysis. Liu Rushi and his entourage similarly stiffened, as if a deity had pressed pause.

In the next breath, Guan Yu materialized before Liu Rushi. Without visible effort, he hoisted the arrogant scion by the throat. His replication ability, fueled by Spirit Severing Stage qi, invaded Liu Rushi's meridians, laying bare the Carefree Sect's secret techniques—at least those the young master had learned.

"Who could’ve imagined Young Master Liu’s cultivation...tsk tsk...proves so disappointing. What say you now?" Guan Yu's tone remained neutral, devoid of triumph, merely observing Liu Rushi’s sneer twist into terror.

"The Nine Word Mantra Seals? Boy, what ties do you have to Heavy Sword Palace? Our three sects stand united—you dare court our wrath? Release my junior brother!" Yan Feng barked, furious.

"I’ve no connection to Heavy Sword Palace. Since you speak for your sect, heed this: apologize to my brother, and you may leave with your lives." Guan Yu smirked. Petty conflicts didn’t warrant bloodshed, but honor demanded recompense.

"Release me, you—urk!"

Liu Rushi’s defiance died as Guan Yu’s grip tightened. The latter’s gaze shifted to Yan Feng—the silent, highest-ranking disciple present.

"Defeat admits no argument. We accept your terms. Release him." Yan Feng sighed, yielding.

"Apologize. Then vanish." Guan Yu flicked his wrist, sending Liu Rushi tumbling. The young master clutched his throat, pale and wordless as he turned to flee.

"Hold. Young Master Liu forgets something." Guan Yu's voice turned icy.

"Apologize. Now." Yan Feng’s stern command brooked no refusal.

"...My apologies." Liu Rushi trembled, humiliation burning his cheeks. He fled without another word.

"Senior Brother—we let this stand?!" Liu Rushi seethed once outside, face ashen. "Our sect’s dignity—"

"This ends here. Remember our mission in the Central Plains—not to bully mortals." Yan Feng's veiled rebuke silenced the group.

"...This junior acknowledges his error." Liu Rushi bowed, reading his comrades’ disapproval.

"Enough. Our sect will reclaim honor in time. Let us meet these Central Plains cultivators." Yan Feng shelved the matter, though resentment toward Guan Yu took root.

Chapter 1132: Immortal Poison Erupts

"No invitation succeeded?" Master Yehe studied Bao and Guan Yu, noting the former’s bruised cheek. His expression darkened with understanding.

"The Carefree Sect proves...challenging. But they’ll come." Guan Yu’s attention shifted to the new presence—a veiled woman in white exuding glacial coldness, like a living iceberg.

"While we wait, may I present Frost Mountain Sect’s Mistress Yun Xuanwu. Mistress, my disciple."

As greetings were exchanged, Liu Rushi’s voice carried through the door: "Liu Rushi of Carefree Sect requests audience with Master Yehe."

"Tsk. Master of pretense," Guan Yu muttered.

Yun Xuanwu sneered, "Liu Rushi—Carefree Sect’s hypocrite. Lecherous yet poses as romantic. Detestable."

"Enter." Master Yehe waved his sleeve, summoning Liu Rushi and Yan Feng into the chamber.

"Marvelous technique! Worthy of a Central Plains sect leader!" Wang Xiaojun applauded. The outsiders exchanged wary glances, sensing threat in Yehe’s display.

"Liu Rushi and Yan Feng pay respects to White Cloud Abbey’s Master Yehe." Flawless etiquette masked prior discord.

"Let us discuss the Dharma Assembly. Though your sects dwell beyond borders, this event’s gravity demands your counsel." Master Yehe’s poise commanded the room.

"My master decrees: guests follow hosts’ arrangements. We trust Central Plains’ wisdom." Yun Xuanwu’s chilly tone held respectful deference.

"Heavy Sword Palace concurs." Wang Xiaojun scratched his head awkwardly.

"And Carefree Sect?"

"We consent...but seek justice." Liu Rushi’s smirk promised trouble. "That woman behind you is our sect’s traitor. Surrender her."

"Ah. Liu Zizai—he claims you’re a deserter. What say you?" Master Yehe’s eyes glinted.

"Senior Brother Liu—I blush to share your name. Your repeated attempts to violate me, your threats when refused...I renounce such a sect. I beg sanctuary." Liu Zizai’s declaration left Liu Rushi apoplectic.

"Carefree Sect’s ‘noble’ conduct! Sister Liu, should White Cloud Abbey falter, Frost Mountain’s gates stand open." Yun Xuanwu’s contempt hung thick.

"Guan Yu rescued her. How proceed?" Master Yehe deferred.

"Having saved her, I’ll bear Carefree Sect’s wrath. Though—" Guan Yu’s boast faltered as his bronze coin spun wildly—immortal poison striking.

"My disciple’s will mirrors White Cloud Abbey’s. Let your sect master seek me if aggrieved. Begone." A sleeve flick banished the interlopers.

Chapter 1132: Treating Immortal Poison

"Master—Brother Guan is poisoned?" Wang Xiaojun’s sharp eyes caught the fleeting darkness on Guan Yu’s face.

"Your vision honors Pure Yang’s legacy. Indeed, immortal poison. Normally dire, but solvable now." Master Yehe’s gaze gleamed—an opportunity arising.

"You refer to our three divine springs?" Wang Xiaojun deduced.

"The Carefree Sect’s Marrow-Cleansing Pool dissolves toxins. Heavy Sword’s Ten Thousand Blades Forge rebuilds flesh. Frost Mountain’s Millennium Ice Cave stabilizes souls. Combined, they’d cure him and aid core formation."

"Would you grant what I earlier requested? I secure his Ten Thousand Blades access."

"For a life? Gladly. Yet one spring suffices not."

"Three Soul-Rejuvenation Pills could open our Ice Cave." Yun Xuanwu interjected, sensing mutual benefit.

Master Yehe produced a vial. "Though precious, White Cloud Abbey keeps reserves."

"And Carefree Sect?"

"Liu Rushi holds minor standing. Their true heir, Yan Qing, handles important matters. Visit them, and hope remains."

"Yan Qing’s forthright. I’ll mediate." Wang Xiaojun offered.

"I refuse!" Guan Yu interjected, touched yet resolute. "I’ll find another way—"

"Go." Master Yehe vanished, allowing no argument.
