However, over these many years, the Right Envoy had come to thoroughly understand the Demon Lord’s temperament. What he despised most were lies told to his face, and dishonest people were also those she herself loathed deeply.

Regarding this matter, the Right Envoy had obtained an exceptionally powerful high-grade magical artifact. While this should have been a joyous occasion, the Demon Lord was no petty-minded man. Being one who grasped grand principles, the Right Envoy believed he would ultimately comprehend and accept the situation.

Moreover, the Demon Lord himself knew Guan Yu’s character well. Otherwise, he would never have allowed Wang Xiaorong to roam freely outside without restraint.

“Without any conditions, why would he simply gift you the Soul-Devouring Whip for no reason?” the Demon Lord asked pointedly, feigning curiosity. “Could it be that your relationship is particularly close?”

“You jest, my Lord,” the Right Envoy replied. “My acquaintance with Guan Yu amounts to merely a few meetings. When we last entered Miao City through the desert, we crossed paths several times but never formed any substantial connection.”

“Then you mean to say you’re neither acquainted nor friends. Has Guan Yu gone mad, gifting such a precious item to you?” The Demon Lord’s disbelief was evident, though his tone carried no anger.

“Perhaps it was out of consideration for the Young Mistress. She knows about my Soul-Harvesting Whip and understands how crucial this Soul-Devouring Whip is to me. Guan Yu likely sought to curry favor through her influence, hence gifting it to me.” The Right Envoy crafted her explanation carefully.

“Curry favor with you? That implies ulterior motives! How could you be so foolish as to accept such a thing?” the Demon Lord rebuked.

In truth, the Right Envoy had prepared her responses long before this audience. “My Lord, if you deem this whip improper for me to keep, I shall return it to the Young Mistress immediately. When Guan Yu offered it, I initially refused vehemently. Only after the Young Mistress’s persistent urging did I reluctantly accept. Since this displeases you, I will send it back at once.”

“Wait!” The Demon Lord immediately halted her, sighing as he observed her. “Have you grown senile with age? When such a treasure falls into your hands, who in their right mind would return it?”

“Whatever his motives, securing the artifact takes precedence. Even if he schemes, we needn’t dance to his tune. Since Xiaorong advised you to accept it, consider this your fortune. The Soul-Devouring Whip’s value to you is immense. After the Eastern Sea Treasure expedition concludes, you shall enter seclusion at the Demon Soul Sect.”

“As you command, my Lord.” The Right Envoy replied with concealed delight, having anticipated the Demon Lord’s greed for treasures.

The Demon Lord continued, “Few in the jianghu know the full history of these twin demonic whips. Only you and I understand the truth. Outsiders merely recall that our sect once had two wielders—your Soul-Harvesting Whip, and the Soul-Devouring Whip borne by a guardian. After the guardian fell in battle a century ago, the whip passed to Xuan Ming.”

“All those tales about inspiring your courage were fabrications for outsiders. The true story remains with me. The most profound memories stem from when you and your betrothed wielded the paired whips together.”

The Right Envoy’s mood darkened as the Demon Lord dredged up the past. Age seemed to fuel his endless reminiscing and nagging.

Though accepting such a treasure from a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect was improper, the Demon Lord’s avarice overrode all scruples.

“Who could have imagined the Soul-Devouring Whip resurfaced with Xuan Ming after all these years? Why would that old fox give it to Guan Yu?” The Demon Lord mused. “That youth carries enough treasures to crush him. At this rate, Xuan Ming’s lifetime accumulation will be drained dry by the boy.”

The Right Envoy explained, “Guan Yu claimed he traded an immortal artifact for several magical tools from Xuan Ming. The whip was merely one among them.”

“What? An immortal artifact? Since when do such things exist?” The Demon Lord nearly leapt in shock. “No rumors of immortal artifacts have circulated for decades! Where did that brat obtain one?”

**Chapter 5106: Intentional Provocation**

“Is that fool out of his mind? Trading an immortal artifact—no amount of high-grade tools could equal its worth!” The Demon Lord’s expression twisted oddly. “He claims affection for my Xiaorong, yet gives such a treasure to others instead of her!”

Though voicing this criticism, the Demon Lord privately fantasized about acquiring the artifact through his daughter—a pipe dream he knew well.

“Other disciples know little beyond this,” the Right Envoy stated. “My information ends here.”

“Questioning you further proves futile. Take the artifact and leave.” The Demon Lord waved dismissively. “Though easily obtained, knowing it came from an artifact trade... Bah! My heart aches at the waste.” He reluctantly returned the whip.

Legends claimed the twin whips were originally one, until a deity—the Soul-Harvesting Whip’s original master—split them during refinement. Designed as dual weapons for left and right hands, the left bore heavier construction with three daggers at the tip, while the right remained lighter with a single blade. Over time, practitioners adapted them into singular weapons.

As the Right Envoy departed, the Demon Lord cursed behind closed doors: “That bastard Guan Yu wreaks havoc wherever he goes! Trading away immortal artifacts—what an unparalleled imbecile! Xuan Ming’s cunning shows in swindling even his own disciples. I must confront Guan Yu myself!”

Donning plain attire, the Demon Lord marched to Guan Yu’s inn. Locating the room, he knocked sharply.

Inside, Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong, and Qiqi were preparing to retire. Assuming Jiang Yuankai had reconsidered the Eastern Sea venture, Guan Yu called, “Who’s there?”

A gruff “Me.” instantly identified the visitor. Wang Xiaorong leapt from bed, hastily adjusting her robes.

Recognizing her father’s voice, Wang Xiaorong nervously opened the door. The Demon Lord stood there in ill-fitting commoner’s clothes—an unprecedented sight.

“Father... Why are you here?” she stammered.

“Can’t I visit?” He brushed past her, scowling at the trio. “Disgraceful conduct!”

“An unexpected honor, Lord Demon,” Guan Yu greeted formally.

“Spare the platitudes!” The Demon Lord rounded on him. “You’ve kept my daughter for days. Return her now!”

Guan Yu stood speechless. Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Father! Are you drunk? Why cause trouble tonight?”

“Drunk? When have you seen me intoxicated?” he snapped.

Noting his dark mood, Wang Xiaorong tempered her tone. “Why visit so late? Surely not to disturb our rest?”

“Rest?” He jabbed a finger at Guan Yu and Qiqi. “Three sharing a bed? Have you no self-respect? What madness binds you to this degradation?”

“I’m not degraded!” she protested weakly.

“Not degraded? I’ll die of shame! Come—return to the sect at once. No more gallivanting!”

As he seized her wrist, she wrenched free. “No! Everything was fine until you came! Why must you always interfere?”

**Chapter 5107: Fury’s Folly**

“Yes, I interfere! As your father, shall I let you court death?” The Demon Lord roared. “The Eastern Sea is a deathtrap! Continue this folly, and next I’ll be collecting your corpse!”

“I won’t go back! My life is with Guan Yu! Why can’t you respect my choices?” Wang Xiaorong’s eyes brimmed.

Guan Yu stepped forward. “Lord Demon, please calm—”

*Crack!* The backhanded slap struck Guan Yu’s cheek. Wang Xiaorong screamed as tears spilled. “Father! How could you?!”

She rushed to Guan Yu, sobbing hysterically before whirling on her father. “If you part us, I’ll take my life this instant!”

Qiqi leapt barefoot from bed, embracing the distraught Wang Xiaorong while glaring at the Demon Lord. “A sect leader lacking basic decency! Were you not her father, Guan Yu would’ve expelled you already!”

“You dare?” The Demon Lord glowered. “Mind your tongue, girl!”

Guan Yu’s fingers tightened on the Desert Eagle pressed to the Demon Lord’s forehead. “Strike her, and I’ll paint the walls with your brains. Test me.”

The cold steel froze the Demon Lord. Memories of Salt Marsh’s near-fatal leg wound from this weapon resurfaced. At this range, even he couldn’t dodge.

“Don’t!” Wang Xiaorong clutched Guan Yu’s arm. “He’s my father!”

Lowering the gun but keeping it drawn, Guan Yu hissed, “Harm my women again, and we perish together.”

The Demon Lord stood rigid, sweat beading his temples. Guan Yu’s lethal resolve—echoing the Right Envoy’s warnings—pierced his bravado. For the first time in decades, death’s breath chilled his neck.
