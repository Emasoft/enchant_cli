“I know, of course I know. You clearly come from a noble family. With your bearing, even the princesses of the capital pale in comparison to your grace.” Qin Taijin fawned with an ingratiating smile.

“Good. This young lady will teach you a proper lesson today!” Wang Xiaorong declared, abruptly kicking him square in the groin.

“Aaaagh!”

Utterly unprepared, Qin Taijin never imagined her words would instantly translate to such a viciously precise strike. The pain dropped him to the ground, writhing and unable to rise.

Unappeased, Wang Xiaorong rained down punches, kicks, and scratches—deliberately targeting vital areas and clawing at his face. “Since you rely on this pretty face to deceive others,” she sneered, “I’ll ruin it for good!”

Such worthless pretty boys only brought misery to innocent girls. These vermin wasted air in life and land in death. Better to toss them into rivers as fish food.

After thoroughly pummeling him, Wang Xiaorong dusted her hands with grim satisfaction. “Let this be a painful lesson for daring to harass me.” Her sharp nails glistened with bloodstains. Glancing at his mutilated face, she chuckled and strode away.

The spectacle of Qin Taijin’s broken form was pitiful. Though his assailant had vanished, he bitterly attributed his humiliation to the Echo Pavilion.

Wang Xiaorong had repeatedly denied any connection to the establishment, but her naivety showed—Qin Taijin had encountered her there. Regardless of truth, he’d forever blame the Echo Pavilion for this disgrace.

Currently, Qin Taijin lacked capacity for elaborate schemes. Half-dead, he twitched spasmodically on the ground like a gutted fish.

Bystanders flocked to the scene. After Wang Xiaorong’s departure, someone recognized him. “Heavens! Isn’t this Young Master Qin of the Qin family? Quick, inform his household!”

Eager meddlers raced to the Qin estate as if gold awaited them. Upon seeing her son’s mangled state, Madam Qin nearly fainted, saved only by Sister Yan’s steadying arm.

“My golden child! What’s happened to you?” she wailed. “Fetch Doctor Lu immediately! Why are you all gaping? Move!”

The Qin family’s physician, Doctor Lu—a sixty-year-old man with greying beard, clad in ash-gray robes—hurried in with two apprentices carrying medicine chests. Hearing Madam Qin’s grief from afar, he feared the worst. A delayed arrival leading to the young master’s death would mean ruin.

“Doctor Lu is here!” a servant announced. Madam Qin snapped to attention. “Bring him in! Stop dithering with formalities!”

Without courtesies, Doctor Lu rushed to the bed. Qin Taijin lay unconscious, face bloodied and caked with dirt—the weapon’s nature unclear beneath the grime.

After checking the pulse and injuries, Doctor Lu addressed Madam Qin. “Calm yourself, madam. The young master’s condition is stable—superficial wounds and a fractured rib. His face suffered lacerations that may scar if improperly treated.”

Relieved, Madam Qin asked, “When will he awaken?”

“The unconsciousness likely stems from pain or mild blood loss. He may simply be asleep.”

Madam Qin wept anew. “Who dared brutalize my son? We must find the culprit! Look how he suffers!”

Doctor Lu privately doubted the investigation’s success. In Qujiang City, only someone reckless or powerful would attack the Qin heir. As Madam Qin’s sobs filled the room, Sister Yan gently suggested, “Let’s allow the young master to rest.”

Nodding, Madam Qin ordered, “Doctor Lu, tend him meticulously. Any facial scarring would be disastrous.”

Though voicing confidence, Doctor Lu knew the ragged wounds risked infection. Dull-blade lacerations already showed swelling—the critical treatment window had passed. Permanent scarring seemed inevitable despite his efforts.

Steward Sun later proposed informing Patriarch Qin to seek external physicians. Madam Qin refused. “Doctor Lu is Qujiang’s finest. My son lives—that’s enough.”

Steward Sun pressed, “The assailant must be found. This requires the master’s authority.”

“Then handle it yourself,” Madam Qin commanded. “Capture every involved scoundrel!”

Reluctantly accepting the task, Steward Sun departed. News of the assault spread rapidly through Qujiang. Many speculated the Echo Pavilion would face Qin family wrath since the beating occurred at its doorstep.

Meanwhile, Wang Xiaorong wandered the streets fuming. “Where’s that shameless Guan Yu hiding? If I find him, I’ll cling till death!” Resolving to deploy cult members for searching, she marched off.

Elsewhere, Guan Yu’s group arrived at the City Lord’s manor bearing gifts. “We’re friends of Young Master Men,” Guan Yu told the guards. “Here to visit during his illness.”

After verification, they were led through ornate corridors to Men Gongzi’s chambers. The bedridden youth, bored senseless, had been teasing a maid when interrupted.

“Guan Yu! What a surprise!” Men Gongzi brightened. “I didn’t expect visitors.”

Exchanging pleasantries, Guan Yu studied the invalid’s leg. “Confined long?”

“An eternity! The physician says six months bedrest.” Men Gongzi grimaced. “I’ll go mad!”

Leaning forward, Guan Yu whispered, “What if I could get you outside sooner?”

“How? Carriers jostle the leg unbearably.”

Grinning, Guan Yu revealed, “A ‘wheelchair’—a chair with wheels. Any maid could push you about.”

Men Gongzi’s eyes lit up. “Truly? You’d build this marvel?”

“Just gather craftsmen,” Guan Yu said. “We’ll create it together.”

Thus began the wheelchair project, sparking curiosity in all present—including Guan Yu’s companions, who’d never heard of such a contraption. The plan unfolded, promising mobility to the impatient noble.
