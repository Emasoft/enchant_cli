“Li Xi, although she had never met Jiang Ziqi in person, was well aware of his various exploits.

This was precisely why she reacted in a manner unbefitting her usual temperament.

‘It’s just one person. Is that worth such astonishment?’ Guan Yu sneered, his tone tinged with jealousy.

This was the first time he had seen Li Xi react this way, and the object of her attention was Jiang Ziqi—whom he had thoroughly trampled underfoot. This imbalance gnawed at Guan Yu.

‘You said... he’s your subordinate?’ Li Xi ignored the barb in Guan Yu’s words, instead posing a question that had long puzzled her.

Guan Yu grinned broadly, puffing his chest with pride. ‘Correct! My newly acquired subordinate!’

**Chapter 908: The Stolen Luxury Car**

A scion of Jingdu’s elite, hailed as the most promising heir to his family’s vast resources—how could such a prestigious young master become a subordinate to an unknown nobody?

No one would believe such a tale.

Li Xi didn’t believe it either. Her gaze toward Guan Yu brimmed with doubt and incredulity.

This wounded Guan Yu deeply!

He rolled his eyes and retorted, ‘Stop wearing that look of disbelief! Is my competence truly so contemptible?’

‘It’s not just improbable—it’s utterly impossible!’ Li Xi stated bluntly.

Guan Yu could only roll his eyes furiously. How else could he vent his frustration? He couldn’t exactly force himself on Li Xi here and now.

Her words cut deeply, shattering Guan Yu’s pride.

But his masculine dignity demanded he not let a woman look down on him.

Guan Yu patiently explained, ‘Nothing is absolute. See the injuries on that guy’s face? I beat him until he surrendered, begging through tears to become my subordinate. I was reluctant—his capabilities are inferior to a dog’s!’

One wondered how Jiang Ziqi would react upon hearing this.

Li Xi couldn’t help but shoot Guan Yu an exasperated glance, momentarily revealing breathtaking charm.

Though she disbelieved Guan Yu’s wild claims, she acknowledged one truth: Jiang Ziqi’s injuries were indeed Guan Yu’s handiwork.

‘How did you survive after beating him?’ Li Xi couldn’t resist a jab.

‘He’s just a pampered heir. Why revere him so?’ Guan Yu retorted, unwilling to serve as Jiang Ziqi’s foil.

Li Xi sighed. ‘Do you know Jiang Ziqi’s stature in high society? The resources he’ll command? Within a decade, he’ll wield power that commands obeisance. Even now, his resources dwarf yours. Face reality!’

Guan Yu smirked. ‘Yet he’s my subordinate. If not, how could I summon him? Why would he solve our problems? Why tolerate my disrespect? That Sun Mande proves it!’

Li曦 opened her mouth but found no rebuttal—the facts aligned with Guan Yu’s claims.

Though forced to acknowledge this, she still doubted Jiang Ziqi’s submission. ‘His pride ensures temporary compliance. Stay vigilant—he’ll bare fangs when least expected.’

‘Is this concern I hear?’ Guan宇 leaned closer, grinning.

Li曦 turned away, her silence speaking volumes.

At the venue entrance, Li曦 paused. ‘How did you meet Jiang Ziqi?’

‘I stole his fiancée.’

‘Mo Ling?!’

Li曦 stared, stunned.

The world had gone mad.

**Chapter 909: The Missing Car**

At the empty parking spot, Li曦’s composed demeanor fractured.

‘My car’s gone.’ Her voice simmered with suppressed rage.

In Jingdu’s elite district, car theft seemed inconceivable.

Their crucial research files—gone.

Guanyu erupted. ‘Files too?’

Li曦 nodded.

The stolen files contained year-long energy storage breakthroughs—now vanished.

Furious, Guanyu dragged Li曦 back inside.

‘Jiang Ziqi’s behind this!’

**Chapter 910: The Elite**

On a Jingdu overpass, a Land Rover sped recklessly.

Inside, Jiang Ziqi raged, smashing his phone against the window.

‘Bastard! Dares treat me as his errand boy?’

His roar echoed through the vehicle.

Today’s humiliation burned—Guanyu’s demands trampled his dignity.

The cycle of dominance had only begun.
