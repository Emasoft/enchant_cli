After some thought, Patriarch Feng continued, "This isn't an ordinary ginseng. There's probably only one like this in the entire world. Why would Patriarch Ran send such a precious item?"

Young Master Feng showed no fear in answering his father's question. "Patriarch Ran came seeking help, but I told him our Feng Family couldn't assist. He then approached Bierlin for aid, only to be refused. After that, he left."

The young master recounted the earlier events in detail. Patriarch Feng hesitated, recalling how he and Patriarch Ran had been close friends in their youth. Who could have imagined the once-prosperous Ran Family would be brought to its knees by a mere ten million? When old friends faced hardship, assistance couldn't be refused.

Yet Patriarch Feng understood their family's precarious situation. "Every coin we spend belongs to the Bill Family now," he sighed. Though powerless to help directly, he declared, "Young Master Bierlin, if Patriarch Ran auctioned this ginseng, it could easily fetch a hundred times ten million. That he gifted it to me shows absolute trust. Therefore, I present this ginseng to you, hoping you'll extend aid to the Ran Family."

Bierlin's eyes lit up with anticipation. He completely believed Patriarch Feng's assessment - such a rare ginseng could command billions effortlessly. Acquiring it would make assisting the Ran Family trivial.

Just as Bierlin opened his mouth to accept, Young Master Feng interrupted urgently, "Father! That ginseng was meant to cure my chronic condition! How could you give it away?"

Patriarch Feng's heart ached. He knew his son's ailment and desperately wished the ginseng could cure it. Yet cold reality demanded otherwise. "If the Bill Family withdraws support, Huayu Group could crush us overnight. What future would we have then? Sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good."

After weighing the consequences, Patriarch Feng stated resolutely, "Young Master Bierlin, this ginseng is yours if you aid the Ran Family. May it cure your persistent health issues."

"Thank you, Uncle Feng!" Bierlin replied with exaggerated gratitude. "I'll transfer one hundred million to the Ran Family first thing tomorrow!" He shamelessly multiplied the sum tenfold while snatching the ginseng case, casting a contemptuous glance at the seething Young Master Feng before departing.

The young master's face darkened with rage, fists clenched so tight his knuckles whitened. When they were finally alone, he exploded, "How could you surrender my cure so easily? Don't you understand what this meant to me?"

"Do you think this doesn't pain me?" Patriarch Feng retorted, continuing his meal calmly. "That ginseng might possess life-restoring properties. If you can produce a hundred million for the Rans, I'll reclaim it immediately."

Young Master Feng gaped wordlessly. After a strained silence, he muttered, "There must be other ways to secure Bierlin's help without sacrificing my future!"

"Future?" Patriarch Feng set down his chopsticks. "If we lose the Bill Family's backing, we'll be begging on street corners within weeks. What future would remain then?"

Though recognizing the truth in his father's words, the young master stormed out in frustration. His chambers held two waiting beauties - though his physical limitations remained, certain "toys" could still provide diversion.

Meanwhile, Bierlin gloated over his acquisition. The billion-dollar exchange seemed a bargain. Instead of immediate consumption, he ordered the ginseng sent home, fantasizing about future indulgences with Chinese beauties while under its effects.

Chapter 2210: Unexpected Developments

Surface calm masked turbulent undercurrents. While Huayu Group pressured the Feng and Ran Families, the Bill Family's support created stalemate. The triple alliance proved temporarily unshakeable, though Guan Yu's sisters at Huayu bided their time, quietly maneuvering until the perfect moment to strike.

Guan Yu himself enjoyed leisurely days in Qiaoyuan District, pampered by beauties. He slept until noon, only awakening when Qing Linger's call interrupted his slumber.

"Ling'er? What brings your call?" Guan Yu yawned, assuming she missed him.

Hearing his sleep-roughened voice, she giggled, "Big Brother Guan! Still in bed at this hour?"

"Nothing urgent," he chuckled. "Late night. What's my favorite girl need?"

Her tone turned shy. "I... need a favor. My cousin Qu Meimei marries tomorrow. Could you arrange impressive wedding cars? Her village hasn't seen proper grandeur."

Considerate as ever, Guan Yu immediately agreed. "Consider it done! Want a Ferrari convoy? Lamborghinis?"

Ling'er hesitated. "Just your armored vehicle would suffice..."

"Nonsense!" Guan Yu interrupted. "I'll handle everything. Expect the most spectacular procession they've ever witnessed!"

Though touched by his enthusiasm, Ling'er worried about imposing. "Really, anything helps..."

"Leave it to me," he assured. "I'll even drive the bridal car myself. When should I collect you?"

After settling details, Guan Yu began preparations. For Ling'er, no effort was too great - this wedding would become legend in her cousin's village.
