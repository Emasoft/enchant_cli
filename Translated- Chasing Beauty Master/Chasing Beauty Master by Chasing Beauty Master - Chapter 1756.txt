Xiao Mei continued, “As for quicksand traps, their size is unpredictable. Some are vast in area. A single person walking across might be fine, but if an entire caravan passes over, the weight could collapse the surface, plunging the entire group into the pit with devastating losses.”

This phenomenon wasn’t unfamiliar to Guan Yu. It resembled natural traps commonly formed in deserts—deceptively flat surfaces where the upper sand layer, hardened by humidity or rainwater, remained intact while the lower layers eroded or shifted underground, creating hollow cavities. When sufficient weight pressed upon the brittle surface over these voids, collapse became inevitable.

Though such sand traps were common in deserts, most posed little danger, as the pits tended to be shallow. Falling in meant nothing more than climbing back out. Yet deeper pits existed—some two or three meters deep—where victims could be buried alive under cascading sand, with no hope of escape.

“Enough of these terrifying tales,” Siqi interjected, her face pale. The more they spoke, the more her fear grew.

Xiao Mei chuckled. “Who’d have thought you’d be so timid? You always seemed fearless, yet a few stories unravel you.”

Guan Yu explained gently, “Siqi carries childhood shadows. Let’s change the subject to ease her mind.”

“Very well,” Xiao Mei relented. “We’ll prepare to move onward.” She turned to organize the caravan.

The group resumed their journey under oppressive fog. Though visibility remained manageable, the heavy air made breathing laborious.

“What’s that ahead?” Wang Jun squinted. Through the mist, two yurts materialized abruptly, as if conjured from the haze.

“Who would dwell here with only two tents?” Xiao Mei wondered aloud.

Guan Yu shook his head. “No detours this time. Let’s investigate.”

As they neared, a third yurt came into view. These weren’t nomad dwellings but a newly established Mo Hun Sect outpost, marked by the sect’s signature crimson flame emblem. The demonic sect had clearly anticipated their route, stationing forces here long before.

Wang Jun recognized the symbols but stayed silent. Guan Yu, equally guarded, motioned toward a tall bamboo pole bearing a cloth banner: *Tea House*.

“Remarkable,” Guan Yu remarked dryly. “They’ve even planted a tea shop in this wasteland. Let’s humor them.”

Inside the largest yurt, a young attendant greeted them. “Welcome! What brings honored guests here?”

“Tea for all,” Guan Yu ordered, deliberately adding, “We’ll await the Mo Hun Sect’s arrival before proceeding together.”

The attendant’s smile faltered imperceptibly. “At once, honored guests.”

As the group settled, Guan Yu scrutinized the sparse setup. “How does one attendant manage alone? Surely more staff hide nearby.”

“Others assist when needed,” the man deflected, retreating to prepare their order.

When the bitter tea arrived, the attendant probed, “Might I ask your origins?”

Guan Yu feigned irritation. “Curious, aren’t you? Our business is ours alone.”

Chastened, the attendant withdrew.

“Why the hostility?” Siqi whispered.

“That ‘attendant’ cultivates spiritual energy,” Guan Yu murmured. “No ordinary server. Best he learns nothing of our Yun Qing Sect ties.”

**Chapter 4594: Fated Enemies**

The stifling heat made the hot tea unappealing. As Guan Yu set down his cup, hoofbeats thudded outside. Through the yurt’s entrance, crimson robes flashed—the Scarlet Lotus Sect had tracked them.

“Persistent leeches,” Xiao Mei spat. “After forcing us to detour, they dare follow?”

Guan Yu watched their pursuers dismount. “Let others deal with them. We’ll avoid conflict.”

But fate twisted again. Moments later, Mo Hun Sect forces arrived, their leader locking eyes with the Scarlet Lotus commander.

“Perfect timing,” the Scarlet Lotus captain snarled. “Today, we purge your filth from the earth!”

The Mo Hun commander smirked. “Brave words for poisoned men. How does your qi flow now?”

Panicked cries erupted as Scarlet Lotus disciples clutched their stomachs. Guan Yu’s group tensed—had they too been drugged?

Wang Jun shook his head. “Our tea was clean. They targeted only the Lotus fools.”

Chaos erupted as weapons clashed. Guan Yu urged retreat, but the attendant intercepted them, proffering excess payment.

“Keep the silver,” Guan Yu dismissed, but a crash interrupted—Scarlet Lotus disciples staggered out, limbs trembling from the sect’s infamous Soft Sinew Powder.

The Mo Hun commander laughed cruelly. “Fleas challenging lions! Your qi is ours to crush!”

**Chapter 4595: Vile Schemes**

Guan Yu recognized the Mo Hun commander—a division leader who’d once aided him, now oblivious to his disguise.

The Scarlet Lotus captain swayed, sword trembling. “Y-You dishonorable curs! Poison is a coward’s tool!”

“Says the thief who steals by night,” the Mo Hun leader retorted. “Your sect’s hypocrisy stinks worse than camel dung!”

Guan Yu edged his group toward the exit, but the attendant barred their path with unnatural speed. “Leaving so soon, honored guests?”

Xiao Mei’s hand flew to her dagger. Guan Yu stepped between them, mind racing. This “tea house” was a snare—and they’d walked willingly into its jaws. The real battle was just beginning.
