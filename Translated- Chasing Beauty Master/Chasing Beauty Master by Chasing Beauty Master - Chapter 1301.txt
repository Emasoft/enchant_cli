Guan Yu pondered. The waiter from that small eatery had deliberately fed the horses adulterated fodder. They must have mixed something harmful intentionally, which meant this was premeditated. Under normal circumstances, horses eat grass that rarely spoils. The animals wouldn’t have deteriorated so drastically unless something had been added to their feed.

“I suspect someone will deliver horses to us soon,” Guan Yu said. “Let’s find a spot to wait.”

“What do you mean?” Xiao Zhi asked, baffled. “Did you arrange for horses? When?”

“Just a hunch. Let’s wait. It’s not fully dark yet. If no one comes by nightfall, we’ll use Sword Flight instead.” Guan Yu chuckled.

Aze nodded. “That’s wise. Using Sword Flight after dark avoids attention.”

Guan Yu instructed everyone to unload their belongings from the horses. “If no one arrives, we’ll leave directly.”

They moved behind a nearby mound. “Hide here,” Guan Yu ordered.

“Why hide?” Xiao Zhi protested. “We’ve done nothing wrong! Besides, how will anyone find us if we’re concealed?”

“Just do as I say!” Guan Yu snapped, his patience fraying. Since his internal qi remained unstable after the energy transfer, his temper had grown volatile. This journey was perilous—especially without knowing if Second-to-Wolf followed them.

As they waited, Xiaotong sidled up to Guan Yu. “Maybe no one’s coming. Let’s camp here tonight. I’ll sleep beside you for safety.”

Xiao Zhi and Aze shuddered visibly. “Must you speak so cloyingly?” Xiao Zhi gritted, rubbing his arms. “Even Guan Yu can’t stomach it!”

“Address me properly!” Xiaotong chided. “I wasn’t speaking to you anyway.”

Her sugary tone made everyone shiver. Xiao Zhi stood abruptly. “I’ll check the horses before I’m sick.”

Hoofbeats interrupted them. “Stay down!” Guan Yu hissed. A dozen torch-bearing riders approached from Perch Town. Their leader—a man with a towel-wrapped head and a hairy mole—cursed: “Useless! The horses collapsed before reaching our territory!”

“Boss, let’s split up and hunt them!” a subordinate urged.

Guan Yu whispered, “The inn staff poisoned our horses. These bandits planned this.”

Xiao Zhi gasped. “Who’s there?!” the leader barked. Torchlight swung toward their hiding spot.

“Couldn’t stay quiet, could you?” Guan Yu glared at Xiao Zhi as bandits approached.

The mole-faced leader leered. “Three men, two veiled ladies—perfect. After I’m done with the beauties, you’ll all get turns!”

Guan Yu stepped forward. “Here to deliver horses, gentlemen?”

“Keep the men’s gold and kill them!” a bandit suggested. “Just take the women!”

“Remove your veils!” the leader demanded. “Let’s see if you’re worth—”

Xiao Zhi began chanting. Lightning split the sky, electrocuting a bandit and his steed. “Fool!” Guan Yu shouted. “We needed those horses!”

Chaos erupted. Guan Yu drew Xiaotong’s Cloud Azure Sword, its blade gleaming coldly. Though not razor-sharp, the spiritual weapon served well for bludgeoning. Behind him, Xiaotong winced at her prized sword’s rough treatment.

The bandit leader fled as his men fell. “Wait!” Guan Yu lunged, kicking a straggler off his mount. Four horses remained.

“Xiaotong rides with me,” Guan Yu decided.

“I’ll share with Siqi!” Xiao Zhi offered.

“No,” Siqi said flatly.

Guan Yu compromised: “The women share a horse. Let’s go.”

At Perch Town’s inn, Guan Yu requested rooms. “Two doubles and one triple.”

The waiter blinked. “Our rooms hold two per bed.”

“Three rooms then,” Guan Yu amended. Xiaotong and Siqi would room together, the men another, leaving him solo.

As they settled, no one noticed the shadowy figure observing from the street—Second-to-Wolf, blade glinting, ready to report back to unseen masters.
