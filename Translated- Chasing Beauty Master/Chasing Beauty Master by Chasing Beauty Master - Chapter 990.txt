“Guan Yu, I know I acted impulsively today. Before coming here, I didn’t know the person I was dealing with was you. Ignorance is no sin, so you shouldn’t hold it against me like this,” Old Wolf said nonchalantly. His mind was preoccupied with finding the safest way to leave with minimal losses.

“Normally, I wouldn’t let you off so easily…” Guan Yu drawled. “But since we’re both part of the jianghu, and you have your own reasons, I’ll grant you this favor today. You may leave now.”

Old Wolf was taken aback by Guan Yu’s unexpected leniency. Suspicious of a trick, he asked warily, “I can just… go?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Correct. What? Do you truly wish to spend the night here?”

**Chapter 2531: Granting a Favor**

“Not at all…” Old Wolf hesitated before adding, “I, Old Wolf, owe you a favor today. If you ever face trouble, seek me out. If it’s within my power, I’ll assist. Farewell.”

With a wave, Old Wolf signaled his twenty-odd followers to depart. Guan Yu watched the group leave with a smile, making no move to stop them.

After their exit, Wei Hongwei stepped forward. “Boss, why let them go? I thought we’d extort more money tonight.”

Guan Yu chuckled and tapped Wei’s head. “You money-grubbing brat. Isn’t five million enough? This should keep the gang afloat for a while.”

In truth, Guan Yu’s considerations ran deeper. While tempted to squeeze Old Wolf for more, he wanted to avoid accumulating enemies. The precarious situation in A City meant too many adversaries would complicate future operations.

Moreover, Old Wolf was the type to retaliate covertly if openly defeated. By showing mercy today, Guan Yu hoped to foster goodwill for potential future dealings.

With Senior Brother Chen still unconscious and the night’s chaos finally settled, Guan Yu declared, “The hall master will manage these funds. Use them for the gang’s needs, and distribute ten thousand to each brother who participated tonight. It’s almost dawn—I’ll head back first.”

Jones bid farewell as Guan Yu drove Xue Jing back to Qiaoyuan District. With the Feng family reclaiming their treasure map, Guan Yu anticipated a storm of trouble heading their way. He looked forward to seeing how the Fengs would withstand the coming onslaught.

**Chapter 2532: Meeting in Person**

Early the next morning, Guan Yu was roused by a call from Hou Jinshun. “Why call so early?” Guan Yu grumbled.

Hou’s voice held apology. “I thought you’d be awake! Rumor says the treasure map auctioned by the Yang family is linked to you. Did you give them yours?”

Guan Yu frowned. “Yes. I wanted to shift attention away from myself. It worked. Why ask?”

“Have you forgotten?” Hou exclaimed. “You already let Yingshan Gu take a fake map! Now people will think you have two. If this spreads…”

Guan Yu’s stomach dropped. If Yingshan Gu discovered her map was a forgery, she’d seek vengeance—a confrontation he dreaded. “She’d keep it secret, wouldn’t she?”

“Secrets leak. I already found out, and others will too. If word spreads, Qiaoyuan will be besieged.”

“Handle the rumors,” Guan Yu ordered. “Confirm reactions and spread news that the Fengs bought the auctioned map.”

After hanging up, Guan Yu lost all drowsiness. The aroma of breakfast led him downstairs, where he devoured a hearty meal.

Realizing Yingshan Gu would grow more dangerous once healed, Guan Yu resolved to strike first. He contacted Second Only to Wolf through Sakurako.

“You want my brother?” Sakurako tilted her head. “That means violence. I won’t tell.”

Guan Yu grinned. “I need his help, but he’ll extort me. You’re my loophole.”

Sakurako laughed, dimples flashing. “Clever! Only I can make him work free.” She retrieved a red flag and planted it on the gate—their covert signal.

“If he sees this, he’ll contact me within two days,” she explained.

By afternoon, Second Only to Wolf called. “Trouble again?” he grumbled.

“Meet at the Flower Night Club at five,” Guan Yu said.

After arranging the meeting, Guan Yu visited his aunt at the hospital. Her legs, once crippled, now showed improvement from his past treatments.

“No more treatments,” Guan Yu advised. “Restore strength gradually to avoid relapse.”

Though disappointed, his aunt agreed. As twilight fell, Guan Yu left, mind churning with strategies to neutralize Yingshan Gu before she struck.

**Chapter 2533: Immediate Response**

“Contact me anytime,” Guan Yu told his aunt. “I’ll come immediately.”

Her gratitude shone through weathered features. “You’ve given me hope to walk again.”

Observing her daughter Qu Meimei’s gaunt husband, Guan Yu noted the man’s alarming thinness but withheld comment. Family struggles weren’t his to interfere with—yet.

As night deepened, Guan Yu steeled himself. The coming clash with Yingshan Gu demanded precision. With Second Only to Wolf’s aid and Jones’ support, he aimed to end the threat decisively.

The jianghu’s tides waited for no one. Guan Yu would meet them head-on.
