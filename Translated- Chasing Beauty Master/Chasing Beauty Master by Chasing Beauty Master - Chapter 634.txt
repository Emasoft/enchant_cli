Guan Yu raised an eyebrow, a faint smile appearing on his face. "It's you, kid! Did Shilei give you her phone number?" This particular number was one he'd specially acquired for Liu Shilei years ago. Like Du Xiaojuan and others close to him, she'd received a memorable six-digit repeating number.

"Exactly! Sister-in-law has practically cut off contact with the outside world now! Our company's affairs are all managed by Sister Xiaojuan and the others. After you disappeared without a trace, Brother Yu, Sister Shilei funded an elite private high school. She's been living and working there ever since..."

"Alright, we'll talk face-to-face! I'm currently in..." After briefly stating his location and arranging a meeting time with Dong Bin, Guan Yu hung up.

Four hours later, an exuberant Dong Bin came running up to Guan Yu.

"Huh?" Guan Yu's eyes widened in disbelief as he took in Dong Bin's weathered appearance. The man who appeared to be in his thirties left him momentarily speechless.

"Binzi, you... how did you age so much?"

"Brother Yu, you... how haven't you changed at all after all these years?" Dong Bin exclaimed in astonishment, enveloping Guan Yu in a bear hug before the latter could react.

"Wait..." Guan Yu suppressed his burning questions as a sense of foreboding gripped him. "Binzi, how many years has it been since I left?"

"Years? Nearly two decades!" Dong Bin explained, tears glistening in his eyes.

"What?" Guan Yu's brows furrowed deeply. He clearly remembered only spending a few years exploring the pagoda's secret realm. How could two decades have passed in the real world? His mind raced with possibilities—had there been temporal discrepancies? Had over a decade elapsed before other nations noticed the pagoda's existence?

After hours of intense discussion under a roadside tree, Guan Yu pieced together the truth. Two full decades had indeed passed. His former lovers had drifted away over time, leaving only Du Xiaojuan struggling to maintain their company. Liu Shilei had retreated into academia, becoming principal of her private high school.

"Which school?" Guan Yu asked softly, head bowed.

"Mingyang!"

"Let's go there first! By the way, you haven't told anyone about my return, have you?"

"No! Our old brothers have all established their own enterprises and families. Only me..." Dong Bin hung his head in shame. "I've been mooching off Sister Xiaojuan at the company without making any real achievements."

Guan Yu chuckled and patted his shoulder. "Nonsense! Consider the old Guan Yu dead. I'm returning as a new identity—a twenty-year-old version!"

"Sister Shilei might get quite the shock," Dong Bin suppressed a laugh.

"I'll need to make her accept this gradually. At forty, she might struggle to believe her twenty-year-old lover has returned unchanged." Guan Yu sighed. Despite their undying bond, the age disparity posed significant challenges.

"Let's take it step by step. Since I'm back with nothing urgent, why not enroll as a student?" Guan Yu's eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration.

"What? Don't joke, Brother Yu! You want to attend school?"

"Why not? Re-experience campus life?" Guan Yu retorted with an amused smile.

"Unbelievable! You really know how to play!" Dong Bin shook his head in mock exasperation.

"To the school then!" Guan Yu sprang up energetically.

Chapter 1612: Enrollment

The entrance of Mingyang Elite Private School resembled a chaotic parking lot, luxury vehicles gridlocking the street as students streamed out.

"Traffic nightmare! Are all these cars for student pickup?" Newly enrolled Guan Yu gaped at the spectacle. While expecting wealthy students, this exceeded all predictions.

Amidst the sea of chauffeured cars, Guan Yu headed for the bus stop across the street.

"All settled, Big Bro?" Dong Bin's gruff voice called from under a shady tree.

"Done. Tired from helping me move all day?"

"Nah. But the brothers miss you already. I don't even want to study anymore..."

"Don't be ridiculous! Return to Y City tomorrow. They need you there." Guan Yu chided.

"Alright. But if anyone here gives you trouble, just call! We'll come bust heads!"

"Enough with the violence. We're in civilized times now—use words, not fists."

As they approached the bus stop, Guan Yu noted several students waiting—proof this elite institution admitted ordinary families too.

"Look! She's coming!" A skinny man in a black Audi hissed excitedly.

"Damn, that little fox makes my itch!" The long-haired driver leered at approaching student Xia Yao.

"Third prettiest campus flower! Let's bag her today!" The backseat fatso urged.

The Audi rolled towards the stop. "Waiting for the bus, Xia Yao? Let me drive you!" The long-haired man propositioned.

Xia Yao coldly ignored them, though her gaze briefly lingered on Guan Yu—the only boy not staring at her.

"Don't be cold, beautiful! We've waited here fifteen days straight!" The gang persisted.

When threats escalated, Guan Yu quietly led Dong Bin away—only to return moments later hefting a massive rock.

"Fuck you!" The boulder smashed into Long Hair's ribs, followed by precise baseball bat strikes flooring his cronies.

"Get lost! If I see you again..." Guan Yu growled, dropping the stone with a thud.

Chapter 1613: Immediate Departure

As the thugs scrambled away, Guan Yu turned to Xia Yao. The ice princess maintained her composure, though her curious glances betrayed interest in this unconventional protector.

The distant rumble of an approaching bus broke the tension—their chaotic first encounter merely the prelude to Guan Yu's extraordinary second youth.
