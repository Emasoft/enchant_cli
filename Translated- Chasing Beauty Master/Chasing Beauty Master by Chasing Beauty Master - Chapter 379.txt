Only those who have reached his level of expertise would understand that mastering first-rate driving skills required both time and extensive training.

How old was Guan Yu really? How much driving experience could someone his age possibly possess?

"Heh, you'll pay for your arrogance!"

Though Wu Haojian's face remained expressionless as he stared at Guan Yu, cold laughter already echoed in his heart.

Yet even as he sneered inwardly, Guan Yu harbored his own icy amusement.

"You have no choice. I've given you a chance to survive—whether you seize it depends on your decision. And..."

Here, Guan Yu paused. His gaze suddenly sharpened to lethal intensity, his voice laced with biting murderous intent: "If you refuse, you'll join your two brothers in death right now!"

"Do you mean what you say?" Wu Haojian struggled to steady his voice, forcing calm into his tone.

"Ha! A gentleman's word is unbreakable—swift horses cannot reclaim it."

Guan Yu smiled faintly.

"Fine. I agree."

Wu Haojian acquiesced with feigned ease. Clenching his teeth against excruciating pain, he limped toward his car, every step shadowed by wariness that Guan Yu might strike from behind.

"Wait."

Guan Yu's voice halted him.

"Changed your mind?" Wu Haojian turned with a cold glare.

"Tch. Don't lump me with your aristocratic ilk." Guan Yu's words dripped with habitual scorn for the privileged. "I merely wish to remind you—this race is between us alone. No interruptions. Don't you agree?"

Wu Haojian's expression darkened. He'd hoped to deceive Guan Yu, but his ploy had been exposed. His original plan—to contact his clan once inside the car and nullify this farce of a race—now crumbled.

Apparently, executing this wouldn't be so simple.

Half-leaning into his vehicle, Wu Haojian retrieved a radio device and flung it at Guan Yu's feet. "Satisfied?"

"You're still being dishonest."

Guan Yu shook his head before rummaging through Wu Haojian's car. From a hidden compartment, he produced an emergency backup phone. Waving it mockingly, he narrowed his eyes. "Don't tell me this was a gift for your mistress?"

Wu Haojian's face purpled with rage. How had Guan Yu discovered the phone's location?

As confusion gripped him, a crushing blow hammered his skull—a dull, splitting agony as if struck by a blunt weapon. Ringing filled his ears as he collapsed, limbs twitching spasmodically.

"Hmph. I show generosity, yet you cling to petty schemes. Greed kills early, you know."

Guan Yu gazed down at the writhing man, voice glacial. For an instant, Wu Haojian felt himself plunging into an icy crypt, a corpse frozen in death. Terror surged through him, primal and all-consuming.

"If you're not dead yet, get up! I won't waste more time on you."

Guan Yu's impatient growl spurred Wu Haojian to rise despite the torment. Clutching his chest, he staggered back into the car—thoroughly chastened now.

Satisfied, Guan Yu turned to Lin Dong, nodding toward the boulder blocking the road. "Little Lin, shouldn't you remove what you placed? Proper work requires proper cleanup."

"Since when do killers bury their victims?" Lin Dong retorted.

Before Guan Yu could respond, Lin Dong vanished into the night with a casual pat to his backside, leaving chaos in his wake.

Guan Yu ground his teeth in frustration.

Lin Dong had irresponsibly fled, abandoning Guan Yu to handle the mess. Watching his comrade's retreating silhouette, Guan Yu could only sigh in resignation.

"Such brothers are a curse."

Shaking his head wryly, Guan Yu approached the massive boulder. Studying the hundred-pound monolith amidst the featureless plain, he marveled—how had Lin Dong transported this here?

Crouching, he gripped the stone's crevices as the ancient copper coin in his mind glowed softly. The words "Gravity System" expanded, applying 60% weight reduction to the obstruction.

"Heave!"

With a grunt of effort, Guan Yu wrenched the boulder upward—just as blinding headlights engulfed him. An engine roared as Wu Haojian's car accelerated violently, tires screeching toward its target.

Wu Haojian's twisted grin reflected in the windshield, certain of his ambush. The vehicle hurtled forward like a predator...

...Only to meet empty air where Guan Yu had stood.

Wu Haojian's triumph curdled into disbelief. How?! The car had outpaced human reaction time! Yet there stood Guan Yu, unscathed in the sodium-lit gloom.

Though disappointed, Wu Haojian didn't hesitate. He rocketed down the highway, howling laughter trailing behind him. Let Guan Yu chase now! Their "fair race" was dead—survival was all that mattered.

Guan Yu watched the retreating taillights, a dangerous smile playing on his lips. After a moment's contemplation, he strolled to his car...

...Only to pause as another vehicle crawled into view. Its driver, Wu Rui, emerged with relieved laughter: "Alive! Finally, a living soul!"

The shaken man babbled warnings about two cars plunging off cliffs, urging caution. Guan Yu listened amusedly until Wu Rui noticed his battered vehicle.

"Buddy, even rich kids shouldn't trash cars like this! Live a little, but keep living, yeah?" Leaning closer conspiratorially, Wu Rui added: "Saw two idiots wipe out earlier. We nobles need to value our necks!"

Guan Yu chuckled at the unintended irony. "Thanks for the advice. I've got business."

As he moved to enter his car, Wu Rui grabbed his arm. "You're not still chasing Wu Haojian? Give up! He's probably already celebrated his win!"

Guan Yu's smile turned cryptic. "Who knows? Maybe he's joining those cliff divers."

Leaving Wu Rui gaping, Guan Yu's car vanished in a roar of acceleration.

**Chapter 952: The Perils of Flamboyance (2)**

Wu Rui stared after the disappearing vehicle, muttering: "What a lunatic." Yet something in Guan Yu's words nagged at him. After brief hesitation, he abandoned his retreat, curiosity overriding caution.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu harnessed the Gravity System's full power. His elite sports car became a silver streak, devouring the distance.

Wu Haojian heard the pursuing engine's snarl moments before headlights engulfed his mirrors. Desperation fueled his driving—taking curves at suicidal angles, tires skirting cliff edges.

Ahead loomed the final hairpin turn—a notorious killer bend. Wu Haojian's last hope: navigate it at full speed while Guan Yu crashed.

Tires screamed as Wu Haojian's car fishtailed, rear wheels dangling over the abyss...

...While Guan Yu slowed, seemingly conceding defeat.

Wu Haojian's manic grin returned. Victory was his!

But as he entered the death curve, Guan Yu's car suddenly accelerated impossibly. The ancient coin's glow intensified—gravity itself bending to his will.

Two vehicles hurtled toward destiny—one driven by desperation, the other by cold calculation.

Somewhere behind, Wu Rui's cautious crawl continued, oblivious to the deadly ballet unfolding ahead.
