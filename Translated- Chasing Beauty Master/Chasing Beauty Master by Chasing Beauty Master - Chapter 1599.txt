“This is indeed a clever plan. Even if we trigger a mechanism, the collapse won’t be immediate. Once we reach the gate, we’ll wait there. The moment it opens, we’ll rush in.”

The stone stele bore several lines of large characters, though Guan Yu no longer cared to examine them. Among the inscriptions was a character for “sword” (劍) that could be pressed inward. Depressing this character allowed the stele to rotate.

After devising their strategy, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong positioned themselves before the stele. Guan Yu declared, “When I say ‘start,’ we’ll rotate the stele together and then sprint. Are you ready?”

“I’m ready.”

Guan Yu took a deep breath, uncertain what mechanisms they might activate. They’d have to improvise as events unfolded.

“Start!”

In near unison, Wang Xiaorong and Guan Yu pressed the sword character, effortlessly rotating the stele ninety degrees. Both bolted immediately toward the grand gate, pressing themselves against its surface. A thunderous rumble followed as cracks spiderwebbed across the stone platform. Within moments, the entire structure crumbled into rubble.

True to Guan Yu’s prediction, the gates of Swordless Villa swung open behind them. Seizing Wang Xiaorong’s hand, he dashed through the entrance.

As if awakening from a nightmare, they found themselves in familiar surroundings—the true visage of Swordless Villa they’d encountered before.

“Brother! Where have you been?” A familiar voice called out—Du Teng’s.

Turning, Guan Yu saw Du Teng and Zhenxiang standing beside the shattered door he’d previously destroyed, now lying quietly on the ground.

Wang Xiaorong gestured excitedly at the pair. “We’ve escaped, haven’t we?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Yes. Look—there’s the door I broke. This must be reality now.”

Du Teng and Zhenxiang approached, curiosity evident. “Where did you two disappear to? We searched everywhere! Why didn’t you answer when we called? We thought you’d fled back to the inn!”

“Elder Brother Du,” Guan Yu explained, “we were trapped in an illusion realm. Barely escaped with our lives. We couldn’t hear your calls.” He glanced at the crumbling platform outside, now stained with bloodstains, confirming their return to reality.

“An illusion?” Du Teng frowned. “We told you to fetch a servant! Zhenxiang and I waited until we grew worried and came out, only to find you gone!”

Wang Xiaorong shuddered. “That mirage perfectly mirrored this place! We nearly fell for it completely.”

“Enough dwelling on that,” Guan Yu interjected. “We’re through now, by fortune’s grace.” Privately, he noted their luck—the trap required two people to rotate the stele. A lone victim would have faced certain death when the platform collapsed.

The illusion’s designer had been merciless, leaving no escape route once the mechanism triggered. Most illusions contained hidden exits, but this one seemed designed for annihilation. Had Wang Xiaorong not accidentally discovered the stele’s secret, they’d still be trapped.

**Chapter 4148: Peach Blossom Grove**

Illusions offered no true safety—without finding the exit, death was inevitable. Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong had been fortunate to escape swiftly, though neither wished to repeat the experience.

Du Teng shook his head. “This place defies reason. You merely went to fetch help and stumbled into a death trap!”

“Stranger still,” Zhenxiang added, “when we returned earlier, we encountered no such illusion.”

Guan Yu theorized, “Perhaps the illusion only captures intruders once. After trapping someone, it deactivates.”

Wang Xiaorong, eager to move forward, asked, “Do we retreat or continue seeking the Swordless Immortal?”

“We press on,” Guan Yu declared. “After surviving so much, retreating now would waste our efforts.” Though Wang Xiaorong harbored doubts, she acquiesced—giving up after such trials felt unbearable.

“Then let’s brave this peach blossom maze!” Du Teng proclaimed.

The Swordless Villa’s entrance remained eerily deserted despite their prolonged presence. Before them stretched an endless sea of peach trees—a sight Guan Yu would rather avoid, but retreat was no option.

“This grove holds dangers,” he warned. “Turn back now if you fear.”

Du Teng chuckled. “I’m no maze expert, but Zhenxiang understands such formations. We’ll manage.”

Zhenxiang frowned. “Where are the others who came before us? How did they pass through?”

“Perhaps this isn’t a maze at all,” Wang Xiaorong suggested. “Just dense trees.”

“Worth testing.” Guan Yu took the lead, carving directional arrows into trunks as they progressed. Hours passed without discernible landmarks beneath thick clouds obscuring the sun.

Du Teng observed, “Maybe it’s exactly as Sister-in-Law said—nothing unusual.”

“Yet we’re on a mountain peak,” Wang Xiaorong countered. “This grove’s scale is unnatural.”

Zhenxiang counted turns, analyzing potential maze patterns. When their path became blocked by dense branches, forcing detours, Guan Yu’s arrows began appearing in reverse—proof they were circling.

Wang Xiaorong suddenly paled. “I can’t channel spiritual energy! The air’s devoid of power!”

Others confirmed the discovery—someone had sealed spiritual arts within the grove. Only physical strength remained.

“The blossom fragrance!” Zhenxiang realized. “Normal peach scent isn’t this potent. It’s suppressing our cultivation!”

Climbing a tree revealed nothing but endless blooms veiled in mist. Directions became meaningless.

“We’re truly trapped now,” Du Teng muttered as they encountered reversed arrows yet again.

Zhenxiang devised a new strategy: marking every passed tree comprehensively. Yet soon they rediscovered previous markings, confirming endless circling.

**Chapter 4149: Entrapment**

Faced with another dead end, Zhenxiang proposed, “Let’s backtrack against the arrows. The maze’s weakness might lie in reversal.”

Hours of fruitless wandering followed until Zhenxiang halted the group. Carving a circle in the earth, she declared, “We’re at the Eight Trigrams formation’s center. Earlier turns suggest...” Her voice trailed off as realization dawned—their captor had woven celestial mathematics into the grove’s design.
