“If I leave your Feng family, I might fare even better. Even if all these people stay in five-star hotels every day, I can afford it. But you’d better not regret this. When anything happens to the Feng family in the future, none of it will have anything to do with me, Bill Jia. And I beg you never to shamelessly come begging for help at my doorstep again, because from now on, my Bill family will never lift a finger for your Feng family again.”

Young Master Feng had already been threatened by Bill Lin several times. Now, faced with yet another threat, he seemed unfazed. Chuckling, he retorted, “Splendid! Then leave! I swear that no matter what happens to the Feng family, we’ll never seek you out. Mark my words—we’ll never seek you. But that doesn’t mean we won’t approach the Bill family.

“If trouble befalls the Feng family, I’ll go directly to the Bill family head for aid. We don’t need a useless young master like you. If you’re so capable, leave right now!”

Though Young Master Feng’s words infuriated Bill Lin, and his taunts felt like outright provocation, Bill Lin knew there was truth to his logic. Even if Bill Lin left, once the Feng family faced crisis, the Feng patriarch would simply contact the Bill family head, and Bill Lin would inevitably be summoned to help. Despite his arrogance before outsiders, Bill Lin never dared defy his father, who would surely berate him.

However, if Bill Lin truly abandoned the Feng family, it remained uncertain whether Guanyu would continue targeting them. The Fengs might impulsively hand over the Ten Thousand Year Demon Realm to Guanyu, settling their feud. This would leave only the conflict between Bill Lin and Guanyu, shifting danger onto Bill Lin while the Feng family escaped unscathed.

Fuming silently, Bill Lin knew he’d overstepped that night. Young Master Feng, sensing the tension, turned to ascend the stairs, remarking, “We have plenty of business vehicles here. Guests can use those. These horses should be relocated soon—the stench is becoming unbearable.”

“You’re such a nuisance,” Bill Lin muttered, deciding to move the horses. Keeping them in the courtyard was impractical. If the standoff with Guanyu dragged on, the horses’ prolonged presence would worsen the air. Young Master Feng had a point: modern roads banned horse-drawn carts, and even the finest steed couldn’t match a car’s convenience. Bill Li had already resolved to use vehicles in the city, storing the horses elsewhere.

“Brother Yuan,” Bill Lin asked, “why did you ride horses all this way? Driving would’ve been simpler, and roads nowadays prohibit horses.”

Yuan Shanding explained, “Between our mountains and here, horses are fastest unless you have a plane. Cars can’t navigate rugged trails. Riding straight through the peaks took mere hours, while driving would’ve required four hours of detours. Our region’s all mountain paths—impassable by car. Horses are essential.”

“I see,” Bill Lin acknowledged. For mountain dwellers, horses thrived on readily available grass, unlike cars needing distant fuel stations. Horses remained **shan’s primary transport, with merchants often hiring them to traverse mountains before switching to trucks, saving time.

“Leaving horses here long-term isn’t wise,” Poison Widow interjected. “Since our plans against Guanyu are uncertain, we must settle them properly.”

“City roads forbid horses,” Bill Lin said. “I’ll arrange cars for you. Tonight, the horses stay here. Tomorrow, I’ll convert a back courtyard into a stable.”

“Agreed,” Yuan Shanding nodded. “Just ensure our horses aren’t harmed.”

“Good. But does anyone here drive?” Bill Lin asked.

Yuan Shanding flushed. Among hundreds in his village, only he could drive. “I can drive,” he declared proudly. “I even own an off-road vehicle!”

“Impressive!” Bill Lin marveled, surprised by Yuan’s resources.

**Chapter 2,793: Hard-Earned**

“Who knew Brother Yuan could drive? So you’re the only one in your gang?” Bill Lin pressed.

“Yes. Others never learned, and we only bought the car last year. It’d draw too much attention.”

“Don’t worry—I’ll provide drivers,” Bill Lin assured.

Yuan had spent over 100,000 yuan on the SUV but rarely used it due to treacherous mountain roads. His men had barely widened paths originally trodden by horses and feet. Even nearby villages had pothole-ridden roads manageable only on horseback. Once, driving his wife Jiu Biyun to her hometown—an hour’s ride—took two grueling hours in rain-soaked mud.

“Then we’ll rely on your drivers,” Yuan said. “Horses would stand out too much here.”

Jiu Biyun interjected, “Where will you stable our horses? They’re precious—far more valuable than your cars.”

Poison Widow understood: in **shan, horses were vital transport. Trained steeds grew scarce as fewer bothered to raise them. “These horses mean everything to them,” she told Bill Lin. “Treat them well.”

Bill Lin pondered. Relocating horses risked alerting Guanyu. “Why not send them back? I’ll escort handlers to your village. Once settled, they’ll return.”

“Brilliant!” Yuan agreed. “Our stablehands can care for them there.”

“Agreed,” Poison Widow said. “This way, Young Master Feng can’t complain.”

After Guanyu’s spies were purged, the Feng estate now teemed with Bill Lin’s loyalists. Infiltrating anew proved difficult, but Guanyu cared little—their schemes seemed trivial.

**Chapter 2,794: The Illustrious Figure**

At dawn, Guanyu and Xue Jing arrived at the Yang family’s private clinic to escort Shuangshuang to school. Her wounds had healed enough for attendance.

“Big Brother! You came to take me?” Shuangshuang beamed, walking gingerly to avoid straining her healing waist.

“You’ve recovered well,” Guanyu praised. “Let’s get you enrolled.”

Her mother fretted, “Study hard and stay out of trouble. This isn’t the countryside.”

“I’ll behave!” Shuangshuang promised. “Big Brother will protect me!”

“She’ll be fine,” Xue Jing reassured. “She knows what’s at stake.”

At Kaifang Academy, Pan Xiaoxia awaited them. “The illustrious Guanyu honors us,” she teased.

“This is my sister, Qu Shuangshuang,” Guanyu introduced.

“Teacher Pan, you’re so pretty!” Shuangshuang chirped.

Pan laughed. “Quite the charmer! Don’t worry—I’ll keep an eye on her.”

Guanyu trusted Pan, who’d once saved his life. He’d also alert his campus faction—the Yu Gang—to shield Shuangshuang. Her beauty might attract unwanted attention, but as “Guanyu’s sister,” even teachers would tread carefully.
