The Right Envoy smiled. "Demon Lord, what could possibly make you so anxious? Is that Guan Yu truly so formidable? This youth who cultivates both demonic and martial arts has boundless prospects. He will undoubtedly become the greatest obstacle to our unification."

Chapter 3886: Deciding Based on Circumstances

The Demon Lord pointed at Wang Xiaorong. "Precisely. Guan Yu may become the greatest enemy of our Demon Soul Sect. Yet this girl has become so infatuated with him that she's beyond redemption. I'm utterly helpless. Right Envoy, you should counsel her when you have time. You're the only one she'll listen to."

"He won't! Guan Yu would never become our sect's enemy! He promised me personally!" Wang Xiaorong protested.

The Right Envoy countered, "Circumstances change. At the very least, you shouldn't favor Guan Yu now. As the Young Mistress and future sole heir of the Demon Soul Sect, you must devote yourself entirely to our cause. I advise you to sever ties with him immediately."

"You're both ganging up on me! I won't talk to you anymore!" Wang Xiaorong turned to leave. The Demon Lord urgently called out, "Wait! How dare you storm off! You haven't told us about the artifacts Guan Yu carries!"

"Even if I explain, you wouldn't understand. That object came from his homeland. I've only seen it once - nothing like it exists here. You need to see it yourself. My words are useless," she retorted.

The Right Envoy suggested, "If you can't describe it, draw it. At least we'll know what he wields, allowing us to prepare countermeasures."

"Aha! Aunt Right Envoy revealed your scheme! You two conspired to trick me into betraying Guan Yu! I'll never talk, even if beaten to death!" Wang Xiaorong exclaimed.

"That's not our intention," the Demon Lord explained hastily, shooting the Right Envoy a meaningful glance. "She merely used a figure of speech. Don't take it literally."

Regaining composure, the Right Envoy added, "Young Mistress, the Demon Lord never suggested harming Guan Yu. However, you must share intelligence about him for the sect's safety."

After consideration, Wang Xiaorong strode to the Demon Lord's writing desk. "Very well. Even if I tell you, you can't touch him." She began sketching while explaining, "This is the most terrifying hidden weapon I've ever witnessed. When you see this, flee immediately."

Her brush strokes outlined Guan Yu's Desert Eagle pistol. Recalling the Demon Lord's description of Yan Zhao's injury, she deduced Guan Yu had shot him. "That fool's lucky to survive," she muttered.

"This trigger," she tapped her drawing, "when pressed, launches a projectile faster than perception. It traverses hundreds of meters instantly, requiring neither spiritual energy nor internal force - just a finger's pull."

"Impossible!" The Demon Lord gasped. "No one could react to such speed!"

"Twice I witnessed it," Wang Xiaorong continued. "At Black Blood Ridge, he blew Xue Zhu's head apart. In Cloud Azure Sect's forest, the thunderous report startled me - then I saw the tree trunk pierced before my eyes could follow."

She sketched a bullet shape. "These projectiles load into a 'magazine' here. When fired, they inflict devastating wounds."

"Truly unprecedented!" marveled the Demon Lord. "If we could replicate this..."

The Right Envoy interjected, "Given these diagrams, our craftsmen could attempt reproduction. Even if it takes decades..."

Wang Xiaorong shook her head, retrieving a bullet pendant from her collar. "Impossible. The internal mechanisms require precision beyond our capabilities. Guan Yu gave me this keepsake."

The metallic cylinder astonished them. "What alloy is this?" The Right Envoy marveled. "Flawless polish! Such density in tiny form!"

"This mere bullet astonishes you?" Wang Xiaorong gloated. "The Desert Eagle itself is magnificent! Guan Yu says it strikes like a desert hawk - swift, relentless, annihilating foes."

Chapter 3887: Reckless Youth

"Desert Eagle... Formidable name," the Right Envoy murmured. "This transcends mortal craftsmanship."

The Demon Lord studied the diagram skeptically. "This awkward shape... Can it truly wreak such destruction?"

"Verify with Yan Zhao!" Wang Xiaorong proposed. "If Guan Yu shot him, the bullet remains in his foot. Compare it to mine!"

"Three-Headed Physician plans surgery tomorrow," the Demon Lord recalled. "We'll retrieve the projectile then."

As the Right Envoy returned the bullet, Wang Xiaorong swelled with pride. Her chosen man commanded such awe!

"Guan Yu's full of surprises," the Demon Lord mused. "Even without Emperor's Seal, defeating him would challenge our best."

The Right Envoy nodded grimly. "In six months, Cloud Azure Sect armed this dual cultivator with four supreme artifacts: Soulfall Blade, Emperor's Seal, Skyburn Crucible, and Jade Scepter. Combined with this Desert Eagle... Confronting him daunts even me."

"We thought him a greenhorn," the Demon Lord sighed. "Yet before reaching his prime, he already wields terrifying power. Eliminating him grows complicated."

Wang Xiaorong interjected, "Father, Guan Yu vowed not to oppose us if you abandon reviving the Heavenly Ape and tyrannical schemes!"

"Foolishness!" The Demon Lord thundered. "Those ambitions define our sect! Without them, we're meaningless!"

As tensions rose, the Right Envoy mediated. "The Young Mistress shares her mother's stubborn devotion. Remember your own youthful passion, Demon Lord?"

Wang Xiaorong seized the hint. Dragging the Right Envoy away, she demanded, "Tell me about Father's past! Did he pursue Mother relentlessly?"

Chuckling, the Right Envoy revealed, "He nearly died for her. Though fate claimed her early, he's single-handedly built our sect against all foes - orthodox sects and demonic rivals alike. His gruffness masks deep care."

"I know his greatness," Wang Xiaorong conceded. "But his mercurial temper vexes me."

"What truly fears him?" the Right Envoy posed. "Failing our founder's legacy? Being unable to revive the Heavenly Ape?"

Before she could answer, the Demon Lord's distant shout echoed: "Don't fill her head with nonsense!"

Chapter 3888: Questions Unanswered

As they hurried from earshot, Wang Xiaorong pressed, "Quick! Did Father desperately court Mother?"

The Right Envoy sighed nostalgically. "His devotion knew bounds. Your mother's early departure left him shouldering sect and parenthood alone against countless enemies. Appreciate his burdens, child."

"I do, but..." Wang Xiaorong's protest faded into thoughtful silence, the weight of legacy and rebellion hanging heavy between them.
