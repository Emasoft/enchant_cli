“I knew it,” Guan Yu said. “Though the Swordless Inn is crowded, it won’t be easy for Zou Wuhui to post missions there. After all, everyone there arrives with their own agendas.”

Wang Xiaorong whispered, “Guan Yu, your hidden identity as the Manor Lord of Swordless Manor essentially makes you the world’s foremost martial artist. If challengers emerge in the future, wouldn’t they inevitably target you?”

“I won’t give them that chance,” Guan Yu replied. “I’ve decided to keep Swordless Manor as a strategic stronghold. If anything goes awry, we’ll have a refuge here. Otherwise, I’d have already revealed the Swordless Immortal’s secrets long ago.”

To Guan Yu, maintaining such a formidable sanctuary was invaluable. It felt almost fortuitous that he’d stumbled into becoming the Manor Lord. With this backing, even if relations with the Cloud Azure Sect soured, he wouldn’t end up cornered like Yan Zhao, hunted by all orthodox factions. For now, he tolerated Xuan Ming within the Cloud Azure Sect, biding his time until his goals aligned. Once he severed ties, Swordless Manor would become his shield—or a base to oppose the sect outright.

Wang Xiaorong remarked, “If I were you, I’d also keep the Swordless Immortal’s secrets.”

“Why? Do you crave the title of ‘world’s foremost’ too?” Guan Yu teased, half-serious. The idea of a woman hungering for fame unsettled him.

“Of course not,” she said. “It’s the treasures in that vault—mountains of gold, jewels, weapons, and those supreme martial manuals on the walls. Everything there is priceless, except the Swordless Immortal’s skeleton. Who wouldn’t covet such riches?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “You’re right. While I care little for fame, those treasures are irresistible. The sheer wealth could rebuild anything, even if the manor falls. With that gold, one could rally forces anew.”

“Exactly,” Wang Xiaorong agreed. “Wealth may not solve everything, but without emotional ties, it’s omnipotent. Securing allies would be effortless.”

“If you desire it, I’ll gift you the vault,” Guan Yu offered playfully. “As Manor Lord, it’s my prerogative.”

“Why gift what’s already ours?” she countered. “I’ve no use for such hoards—no grand ambitions. Keep them yourself.”

“How unlike the Demon Sovereign you are,” Guan Yu mused. “He’d covet every coin. You’d rather live unburdened.”

Wang Xiaorong gazed at the dimming sky. “His ambition stems more from vengeance than greed. Without that driving spite, he’d never have risen so high.”

“Vengeance? Was the Demon Sovereign wronged?” Guan Yu asked.

“Not directly. He strives to fulfill his master’s dying wish. That’s the root of his obsession.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “His master—wasn’t that Meng Hua the Ancestor? The man brought about his own demise through arrogance, becoming a demon.”

“No. His true master was Wei Shengjin, Meng Hua’s disciple. Before dying, Wei passed down Meng Hua’s legacy, tasking Father with continuing their grand ambition. Father taught himself everything from those remnants—cultivation, strategies. He’s largely self-made.”

“Impressive, albeit tragic,” Guan Yu said. “A master’s charge should be honored, but not if it breeds evil. I suspect your father’s own hunger fuels him more than loyalty.”

Wang Xiaorong fell silent. To outsiders, the Demon Sovereign was a monster—a title earned through bloodshed. Yet to her, he remained a complex figure: ruthless but forthright, unlike hypocritical orthodox sects that schemed in shadows. She knew arguing was futile; Guan Yu, at least, didn’t judge factions by their labels.

As dusk deepened, Guan Yu suggested, “Let’s return. We’ll see what Prince Zou decides.”

Back at the inn, they found Wang Jun loitering. “Care to join me for a meal?” he asked.

“Save your appetite,” Wang Xiaorong said. “This town has nothing worth tasting.”

Inside, the group crowded Prince Zou’s lavish suite. Zou Wuhui reported, “I’ve recruited five from Swordless Manor. It’s the best I could do. We’ll see what the Battalion Commander brings.”

“Five is better than none,” Prince Zou said. “We’ll wait.”

Guan Yu exchanged a glance with Wang Xiaorong—he hadn’t known about the Battalion Commander’s mission. Irked but resigned, he acknowledged his role as a mere protector.

“Your Highness,” Wang Xiaorong asked, “do we depart tomorrow or wait?”

“That depends on the Battalion Commander’s results,” Prince Zou replied courteously. Though eager to reach the capital, he valued safety over haste.

Guan Yu privately longed to conclude this duty. Once in the capital, Master Xuan Ming would send him to the desert for the second volume of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique—key to breaching the seal in his mind. Wang Xiaorong, however, dreaded their impending separation.

“Given our thin numbers,” she lied smoothly, “we should bolster our forces before moving.”

**Chapter 4191: A Lone Return**

That evening, the Battalion Commander returned alone, dampening moods. “Your Highness,” he began, “I found mercenaries—a bandit group on Crimson Fame Mountain. Their leader, Crimson, offers six hundred men… for a price.”

Prince Zou stroked his beard. Six hundred sounded excessive—and politically awkward. He glanced at Guan Yu, who questioned, “Are they skilled or mere rabble?”

“Their reputation suggests competence,” the Commander said. “They’ve repelled multiple assaults.”

“I’ll inspect them tomorrow,” Guan Yu decided. “We’ll take only the elite.”

Prince Zou nodded. “Negotiate wisely. Cost matters, but so does quality.”

As the feast resumed, a hired warrior dared ask, “Your Highness—if you’re truly a prince, why hire so many? Who hunts you?”

Prince Zou smiled faintly. “My identity is no secret. Our enemies are disciplined, relentless. Numbers alone won’t suffice—we need strength.”
