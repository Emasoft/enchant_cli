The bearded man also believed he had fled swiftly, certain his pursuer must have lost track.

“Oh? The paltry silver you’ve taken holds no interest for me,” Guan Yu suddenly materialized on the other side of the man, speaking coolly.

“Gods damn you! You nearly scared me to death!” The bearded man recoiled in terror. “When the hell did you get here?!”

“Truthfully, I arrived before you. You were simply too exhausted to notice,” Guan Yu replied mildly, amused by the man’s fright.

Though despair twisted the bearded man’s features, he refused to yield. Seizing the moment with his foe so close, he swung his broadsword in a vicious arc toward Guan Yu.

Anticipating the strike, Guan Yu sidestepped effortlessly, darting to the edge of the forest. The attack posed no threat—its sluggish speed couldn’t hope to graze him.

Sweat dripped from the bearded man’s brow as his face darkened. “If you crave death, I’ll oblige!” he roared. A golden radiance coalesced around his arms, intensifying until it blazed like sunlight.

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. *Well now, a cultivator of inner energy!* Though the man’s energy remained concentrated in his limbs, its density hinted at formidable foundations. With further refinement, he might even achieve external projection.

Without another word, the bearded man channeled his energy and lunged anew. Empowered by his cultivation, his movements quickened dramatically, strikes sharpening into lethal precision. Guan Yu noted with interest that the techniques seemed familiar—echoes of styles he’d encountered before.

*This is formal martial arts. He must have a master.* Yet the man wielded his forms rigidly, repeating the same limited patterns. Despite enhanced speed, Guan Yu evaded with ease, the attacks never nearing their mark.

“Who trained you?” Guan Yu inquired, still dodging.

“None of your damned business! I’ll split your skull today, you meddling ghost!” The golden glow around the man’s arms flared brighter, his inner energy surging.

But Guan Yu had tired of this game. For a cultivator of moderate skill to stoop to banditry? *What a waste.*

In a blur, Guan Yu appeared behind his opponent. Before the man could turn, a kick slammed between his shoulder blades. As the bearded man staggered forward, Guan Yu rematerialized before him, delivering an uppercut kick to the chin.

Teeth shattered under the impact. The bandit crashed backward, broadsword clattering aside. Two casual strikes had ended the fight—the bearded man now sat spitting blood, dazed and disoriented.

“Resistance is futile. Ten of you wouldn’t suffice,” Guan Yu declared, approaching.

“Who...what are you?!” the man gurgled through bloody foam. “We’ve no quarrel! Why hunt me?!”

“True, no quarrel exists. But Lord Qin commands your death, and I obey. Your time ends now.” Guan Yu raised a hand, feinting another strike.

Realization dawned. This unstoppable killer served Lord Qin—sent to silence him permanently. *The demand for ten thousand tauns...I overreached.* The bandit cursed his greed.

“Mercy, great lord!” He kowtowed desperately. “Whatever Lord Qin paid, I’ll double it! Spare me!”

“Spare you? Lord Qin offers twenty thousand taels for your head. Do you think masters of my caliber come cheap?” Guan Yu sneered.

“Twenty thousand?!” Rage contorted the man’s bloodied face. “That thrice-cursed Lord Qin! He’d sooner pay double for murder than honor my demand?!”

Gulping air, he blustered, “My brothers await! If I don’t return by dawn, they’ll expose Qin’s crimes to the Imperial Son-in-Law! Kill me, and you invite catastrophe!”

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “How amusing. Do you imagine I’d leave your gang breathing? Every accomplice—every hostage—dies tonight. No witnesses remain to whisper tales.”

**Chapter 5012: Two Plans**

“Lord Qin, your cruelty knows bounds!” The bearded man howled. “We’ll haunt you from the grave!”

Guan Yu hid a smile. *Enough theatrics. Push further, and he might take his own life—endangering Chu Fan.*

“Yet I wonder,” he mused aloud, “why spend twenty thousand on vermin like you? Hardly worth my fee. Where’s the challenge?”

The barb struck deep. Humiliation burned through the bandit’s fear. “Spare us, and we’ll serve you lifelong! Slaves to your will!”

“Hmm. I do lack capable hands...” Guan Yu trailed off, letting hope kindle.

Seizing the opening, the bandit babbled, “Our master Zhao Wuyuan (Without Fate) ran with Dai Xiaotian (Sky Dawn), the Martial Alliance Leader thirty years past! We’ve prestige, despite our...trade. Spare me, and command us all!”

Guan Yu recalled similar techniques at Swordless Inn. *This oaf, trained since youth, remains mediocre. Pathetic.*

“I might spare you,” he conceded. “But Lord Qin won’t. Your extortion sealed your fates.”

He spun the tale: tomorrow, poisoned wine would accompany the silver. A ruse to capture them alive for execution, earning Qin official favor.

“Vile!” the bandit spat. “I thought it easy coin...never foresaw this!”

“Your deaths were inevitable,” Guan Yu pressed. “Lord Qin tolerates no loose ends.”

“Then why attack tonight?”

“Plan Two. Young Master Qin grows impatient.”

“That viperous whelp!” The bandit shuddered. “I yield! How survive this?”

“Release Chu Fan immediately,” Guan Yu ordered. “Flee tonight. Hide at Swordless Inn—seek Du Teng. Claim my patronage. Should Qin pursue, threaten exposure. Their reputation crumbles if this scheme surfaces.”

**Chapter 5013: Life Above All**

Relief flooded the bandit. “We’ll obey! Our eternal gratitude!”

Yet Guan Yu remained wary. He shadowed the man to a derelict northern compound near pastures. A coffin-center courtyard hid a cellar entrance.

As the bearded man descended, Guan Yu lingered. When coffin-lid shifted again, he hid behind straw curtains.

The bandit emerged with companions dragging bound, blindfolded Chu Fan.

“We’re betrayed,” the leader announced, recounting Guan Yu’s ambush. “Lord Qin sent killers!”

“But...your injuries! What now?”

“That miserly Qin! We demand fair pay, and this?” Another thug brandished his blade. “Let’s storm them!”

Watching unseen, Guan Yu weighed intervention. *If they harm Chu Fan...*

But the leader stayed his men. “No! We vanish tonight. Release the hostage. To Swordless Inn—survival first!”

Relief eased Guan Yu’s tension. The path to saving Chu Fan now lay clear—and Qin’s treachery would soon face reckoning.
