“Now that Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu have been rendered useless, and Bierlin has lost his right-hand men, he must find new allies to deal with me. The Flying Sky Wolf is his best shield. Having suffered losses at my hands before, a cunning man like him won’t confront me directly without such a pawn.”

“It seems you understand Bierlin well. I share your view—he intends to exploit the Flying Sky Wolf’s identity to politically maneuver against you, using the notorious reputation of the Ten Great Evils to intimidate you.”

Guanyu chuckled dismissively. “The Ten Great Evils? Hmph. While the title sounds fearsome, to me, they’re nothing more than schoolchildren.”

Guanyu’s innate arrogance was something Elder Yang had grown accustomed to, but the Ten Great Evils of the martial world were far from the mere schoolchildren Guanyu made them out to be.

Elder Yang gave him a peculiar look. “A few among the Ten Great Evils are truly formidable. You shouldn’t underestimate them. Though they share the same title, they aren’t united—each is fiercely self-serving.”

“Are you suggesting I recruit the Ten Great Evils to ally against Bierlin?” Guanyu pondered. While such a move might draw mockery, utilizing them could prove effective despite the stigma.

Elder Yang cautioned, “Never let down your guard. Though your influence grows daily, complacency is fatal. Pride has no place here. Already, two of the Evils oppose you. If more join, the burden may become unbearable.”

“Moreover, after the incident at your doorstep, many of your men lost their fighting capacity. Though Bierlin’s forces also suffered losses, he’s rallying martial factions against you. If you remain lax, his next assault will not be as easily repelled.”

“Martial artists are no common fodder. Each possesses unique skills—masters abound. If Bierlin unites these forces, your troubles will multiply.”

Guanyu fell silent, absorbing Elder Yang’s words. The elder spoke truth. While Bierlin openly allied with the Flying Sky Wolf, his hidden reinforcements remained unknown. Should he swiftly amass a formidable force, defeat could spell catastrophe.

The Bierlin family’s wealth was boundless, and wealth bought loyalty. With enough gold, any ally could be secured.

Guanyu had assumed Bierlin would retreat after losing Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu, but Elder Yang’s warning revealed the gravity of the situation. “I’ll make arrangements upon returning,” Guanyu said tersely, wary of Yang family loyalties. He suspected spies in his midst—why else had the Feng family ambushed him at Houyuan Temple?

Elder Yang studied the chessboard before him. “I’ve inquired about the incident at your residence. Your mercy in sparing lives surprised me. Yet one puzzle remains: why spare Fang Su after he crossed your line? It contradicts your nature.”

“Fang Su fled before I could act. His whereabouts are unknown. I judge deeds, not bloodlines. With him gone, his clan holds no enmity toward me. Let him enjoy borrowed time—it allows me to regroup.”

“My forces are stretched thin stabilizing newly claimed territories. Though we’ve absorbed some of the enemy’s men, they’re unreliable. Fang Su’s reprieve is temporary.”

“Consolidation is wise. Footing must be secured first. What of tomorrow’s auction?”

Guanyu smiled. “I must thank you for reserving me a seat—an unexpected courtesy. I attend merely as an observer.”

“Don’t you wish to know the treasure map’s origins?” Elder Yang’s tone turned cryptic.

“Of course. My agents investigated, but the consignor remains under Yang family protection. Have you uncovered its source?”

The elder’s smile deepened, revealing nothing. “My inquiries yielded little. The consignor—a simple farmer—committed suicide.”

“Suicide? Before claiming vast riches? Absurd!” Guanyu exclaimed.

Elder Yang sighed. “He was under our protection, yet slit his wrists two days prior. My men face interrogation, and even I’m suspected. Only the autopsy will clear our name.”

Guanyu’s mind raced. Why would a man on wealth’s brink take his life? Though foul play seemed likely, accusing the Yangs would harm their reputation—a price too steep for mere gold.

The elder’s account remained unverified. None had seen the consignor since the Yangs took custody. Guanyu knew pressing further was futile—secrets kept would stay buried.

“Checkmate, Guanyu!” Elder Yang crowed as his pieces besieged the opponent’s base. “Your defeat is imminent!”

“Not quite.” Guanyu moved his chariot piece decisively. “You concentrated forces at my gate but left your rear undefended.” The counterstrike left Elder Yang speechless—a masterstroke exploiting neglected flanks.

The elder stared, then laughed ruefully. “Well played! My eagerness blinded me to your lurking chariots. I concede.”

“Your usual caution abandoned you today. Was this deliberate leniency?” Guanyu teased, unfamiliar with the elder’s true skill.

“No concessions in chess!” Elder Yang insisted. “Another match!”

As night deepened, Fang Su returned home under cover of darkness, his girlfriend Liu Chan in tow. The Fang patriarch awaited, urgency in his tone. “Your aunt arrives soon to aid us against Guanyu. Lay low until then.”

“But Guanyu—” Fang Su protested.

“Bierlin allies with the Flying Sky Wolf, buying martial support. We’ll join their coalition. Tomorrow’s auction preoccupies Guanyu—you’re safe for now.”

Though fearful, Fang Su acknowledged the logic—academic term’s start would scatter Guanyu’s student forces. Rebuilding required time they could exploit.

As dawn approached, strategies intertwined like chess pieces—moves and countermoves in a lethal game where wealth, power, and hidden blades would determine the victor.
