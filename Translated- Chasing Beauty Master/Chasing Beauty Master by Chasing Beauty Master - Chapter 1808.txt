Siqi also wore a look of frustration. She hadn’t expected her earlier remarks to cause such trouble, yet she still had something to say.

“You two love-struck fools, can’t you stop embarrassing our sisters?” she declared without reservation. “I don’t share your lofty standards. Though Guanyu may seem ordinary, I’m willing to accept him.” Her relationship with Guanyu had long been common knowledge within the Cloud Azure Sect.

Previously, everyone believed that after Senior Brother Yan Zhao’s betrayal, the disciples of Tiger Head Peak followed Lin Chen and Ling Su’s lead. But Guanyu’s rapid rise had recently distinguished him among the sect’s many disciples.

In a short time, rumors spread that Guanyu had won Siqi’s heart, their relationship confirmed during Guanyu’s desert expedition. Now it was widely known.

“Look at you, acting coy after getting such a prize,” Xiaolian retorted irritably. “Guanyu’s an exceptional beauty—any girl would want him. Did we need you to announce it?”

Guanyu knew all eyes were on him. Better to stay silent to avoid provoking collective ire. Let Siqi handle these sharp-tongued girls.

Wang Jun noticed Guanyu’s unusual reticence. Normally eloquent, Guanyu now held his tongue—likely to avoid quarreling with unreasonable maidens.

Xiaochun interjected, “Look at Wang Jun beside Guanyu. Isn’t he also quite dashing?”

“If you ask me, he resembles a woman,” Xiaolian remarked coolly. “Handsome face but too slender. I dislike bony men—all ribs under the touch.”

Xiaotong burst into laughter. “Xiaolian, do you prefer someone like Xiao Zhi? Too bad his fiancée’s here! Their wedding’s tomorrow—no chance for you!”

Everyone knew this was jest. Du Bingyan chuckled along as Xiaolian flushed. “Stop spouting nonsense! If you like skinny men, here’s one—go grab him!”

As Xiaolian chased Xiaotong around the group, the latter cried theatrically, “See? Xiaolian’s silencing witnesses! Help!”

Wang Jun sighed. Any man caught in these girls’ banter became fair game. As for his own romantic inclinations—even he wasn’t certain, nor did he care to dwell on it.

The boisterous journey continued until nightfall softened their antics. Perhaps unnerved by darkness, Xiaolian suggested, “Siqi, since only your Guanyu offers protection here, shouldn’t he walk closer?”

Though irked by “your Guanyu” repetitions, Siqi called, “Guanyu, Wang Jun—come between us. These fools need reassurance.”

Seizing the opportunity, Guanyu swiftly positioned himself among the girls. Xiaolian immediately latched onto one arm, Xiaochun the other, while Xiaotong audaciously gripped his belt.

“What are you doing?” Siqi protested. “Trying to devour him? Where’s your decorum?”

“Don’t be stingy!” Xiaolian retorted. “We’re borrowing him temporarily. Must you fuss?”

Siqi rolled her eyes. Everyone knew their fear was pretense—merely excuses to cling to Guanyu. Wang Jun, receiving no such attention, observed wryly.

“Aren’t you worried other disciples will resent me?” Guanyu feigned concern.

“You’re our hero tonight,” Xiaochun giggled. “Who’d resent a protector?”

Guanyu offered, “If you ladies desire companions, I know quality candidates.”

As banter continued, Xiaolian sighed dramatically. “I regret not pursuing you before Siqi claimed you. We’d have stood a chance, right?”

“Perhaps,” Guanyu mumbled, triggering Siqi’s glare.

Realizing his misstep, Guanyu backpedaled. “Just joking!”

“Liar!” Xiaochun accused. “Who can trust your words?”

Trapped between offenses, Guanyu pleaded, “Spare me, ladies! My frail constitution can’t endure this!”

Du Bingyan laughed. “You humor their nonsense so well. Knowing you all brings me joy.”

The mood lightened until Guanyu redirected conversation: “Who’ll style tomorrow’s bride?”

“Are you blind?” Xiaotong preened. “I’m the makeup master here!”

Guanyu teased, “Your caked face proves your dedication.” A sharp pinch from Xiaotong punctuated his jest.

As talk turned to Du Bingyan’s tragic past, somber reflections emerged. Many shared similar hardships before joining Cloud Azure Sect.

When asked about his origins, Guanyu hesitated. His sealed memories offered no childhood tales, so he described his “hometown”—a place of skyscrapers and aircraft.

“Forty-meter metal birds?” Xiaolian scoffed. “Impossible!”

Wang Jun interjected, “Better stop—you’re confusing them.”

“Skyscrapers house people,” Guanyu explained. “Aircraft carry hundreds skyward—faster than any flight spell.”

Xiaolian demanded proof, but Guanyu sighed. “You’ll never see them here.”

As debates over fantastical machines ensued, Xiaochun griped, “Must you always mention food?”

“You’re one to talk!” Guanyu retorted. “Your roundness proves your obsession!”

Xiaochun shook Siqi in protest until peace was restored. The travelers continued, their laughter echoing through the darkening path, united by camaraderie and shared mysteries.
