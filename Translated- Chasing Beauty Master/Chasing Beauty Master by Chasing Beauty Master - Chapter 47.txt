Thoughts raced through Guan Yu’s mind as a flicker of relief washed over him. Had he not come to find Liu Shilei, another man might have seized this opportunity! Without his presence, the drug’s effects would have left her vulnerable to violation once its potency peaked. The mere notion tightened his chest with visceral discomfort.

The dilemma remained—having identified the cause, he now faced paralysis. His healing ability had just mended her wounds. Another half-hour’s wait risked exposing her compromised state should colleagues enter.

The optimal solution? Satisfy her needs. Resolve hardened within him. Was this not an act of virtue, akin to "learning from Lei Feng"? Better to claim this rare encounter than let others benefit.

With swift decisiveness, he withdrew his right hand from between her thighs.

“Don’t…please…help me! I’m…so desperate!” Liu Shilei’s plea trembled with tears as her glazed eyes clung to him, fingers clawing at his wrist with pitiful urgency.

Gulping audibly, Guan Yu emerged from beneath the desk and hauled her toward the wall near the door—a strategic position to react if intruders entered. He prayed no one would come during class hours, yet feared the lurking medic might still prowl the corridor.

Liu Shilei’s labored breaths fogged the air, her flushed neck and ears radiating heat. The feminine musk of her exhalations accelerated his pulse.

Locking gazes with her enchanting face—maddeningly beautiful—he steeled himself. His left hand cradled her nape as he tilted his head, capturing her crimson lips in a fierce kiss.

Sucking greedily at her mouth, he felt her body press hungrily against him. His right hand yanked her skirt waistward, fingers plunging past stockinged hips into damp silk.

Vertical access proved far simpler than his earlier contortions. Stroking the velvety folds, euphoria surged as her slick warmth coated his fingertips.

This paragon of elegance—prim, tender, smoke-and-honey maturity—now melted against him, legs splayed as she ground herself onto his hand, begging for deeper friction.

“Oh…heaven…ah—”

Observing her unraveling expression, Guan Yu redoubled his efforts. The obscene squelch beneath her skirt strained his arousal to unbearable rigidity.

Liu Shilei’s gasps sharpened, body quivering on the precipice. When he leaned closer, she lunged like a parched fish, tongue thrusting into his mouth.

Ecstasy lifted Guan Yu skyward. Though physically unrelieved, the psychological triumph of conquering her—this goddess reduced to desperate supplicant—transcended earthly pleasure.

As their tongues tangled, her wandering hands found his tented track pants. The featherlight brush against his bulge made him shudder, deepening their kiss with bruising intensity.

**Chapter 112: How Could This Happen**

Their entwined posture—mouths fused, his hand working beneath her skirt while hers palmed his erection—painted an incendiary tableau. Each stifled moan from Liu Shilei stoked his primal urge to bend her over the desk and claim her.

Yet reason prevailed. Discovery meant ruin for them both. Unlike her drug-addled abandon, he must restrain this wildfire.

Miraculously undisturbed, minutes later Liu Shilei arched violently, a keening wail escaping as tremors wracked her frame. Saturated undergarments clung to her thighs when Guan Yu withdrew glistening fingers.

Post-climactic Liu Shilei glowed with intensified allure—dewy, satiated, radiating femininity. Biting her lip, she struggled for words before collapsing into tearful shame.

“How…could I?” She crumpled to the floor, clawing at her hair. The memory of forcing his head between her legs, begging for violation, tormented her.

Guan Yu ached at her distress. Her disheveled skirt revealed soaked lingerie, yet her anguish pierced deeper than desire. Kneeling, he murmured, “Sister-in-law…let me take you home.”

As they exited, the lurking medic Zhang gaped in outrage. Guan Yu’s fist smashed his nose before he could protest. “Kneel unless you want police involvement!” he growled.

Escorting Liu Shilei away, he explained Zhang’s drugged betrayal. Fury stiffened her frame—“That beast!”—before practicality prevailed. Public exposure would only compound her humiliation.

**Chapter 113: Accident**

The walk of shame chilled Liu Shilei’s damp thighs. Back in her deserted dorm, Guan Yu removed her heels, marveling at silk-clad feet before tactfully retreating to fetch water.

Alone, Liu Shilei touched her sodden underwear and shuddered. Residual aphrodisiac pulsed through her veins. Fingertips brushing swollen flesh reignited tremors—soon she was panting against the bed, lost to clandestine ministrations.

Returning, Guan Yu froze at the muted cries beyond her door. A peek through the crack seared the scene into his retinas: Liu Shilei sprawled in abandon, fingers working furiously as her back arched off the mattress.

Blood roared in his ears. The voyeuristic tableau cemented his earlier conquest—and the treacherous road ahead.
