“No problem, no problem…” The kitchen manager hurried forward, nodding repeatedly as he directed workers to carry the chaotic-looking dishes upstairs with Guan Yu.

When they pushed open the hospital room door again, Old Man Zhao stared at the steaming black goo in Guan Yu’s hands, his eyes nearly popping out. “Guan Yu? This...this is what you personally cooked? Is this...edible?” The old man asked with a pained expression.

Chapter 275: Brother, You’re a Good Man

Not just Old Zhao reacted this way. The nurse who escorted Guan Yu earlier now covered her mouth to stifle giggles, while burly bodyguards struggled to maintain straight faces. Yet none mocked Guan Yu—his intentions were good, even if the food appeared inedible.

Guan Yu shrugged casually. “There are more dishes coming. These aren’t for you anyway—she’s the judge.” He nodded toward Zhao Jinger propped on the hospital bed.

As all eyes turned to the pale girl, they froze. Jinger stared fixedly at the dishes, lips pressed tight yet swallowing repeatedly. When she finally spoke, her words shocked everyone: “Thank you, brother...I’m so hungry!” While others found the aroma strange, to Jinger it smelled like ambrosia.

As the questionable dishes were laid out, Guan Yu lit a cigarette and leaned back comfortably. No one objected to his smoking—all attention focused on Jinger devouring the food with unprecedented appetite.

Bodyguards exchanged bewildered glances. What bizarre tastes did this young mistress have? Yet Old Zhao’s eyes shone when looking at Guan Yu. This youth kept astonishing him—not just with healing arts, but now awakening his granddaughter’s appetite. He’d never seen Jinger eat so heartily.

Within ten minutes, Jinger cleaned every plate. Blushing, she patted her stomach and slithered back under the blankets. “Post-meal movement aids digestion,” Guan Yu said around his cigarette. “Get up and walk.”

The suggestion stunned everyone. Get out of bed? Mere hours ago, Jinger had been deathly ill. Yet the impossible became reality—without assistance, the girl stood weakly but steadily.

Old Zhao bit back emotion. Convinced at last, he dismissed the entourage per Guan Yu’s suggestion, leaving only the young man with Jinger. When the old man lingered anxiously, Guan Yu teased: “Worried I’ll sell your granddaughter?”

After final reassurances, Old Zhao departed. Jinger then chided gently: “Brother, why speak so to Grandpa? He’s just concerned...”

Guan Yu’s expression softened. “An octogenarian shouldn’t keep vigil. With me here, he can rest.”

Tears welled in Jinger’s eyes. “Brother...you’re a good person.”

“I know,” Guan Yu grinned. Jinger’s giggles bloomed like snow lotus flowers.

Outside, departing Old Zhao told his driver: “That lad’s remarkable.” Bodyguard Fang Zhe nodded: “Indeed. Skilled...and intriguing.”

“If he cures Jinger,” the old man mused, “watch over him when I’m gone.” Fang Zhe’s reply held solemn promise.

Alone with Jinger, Guan Yu learned her grandfather’s staggering status—a founding father of the nation. He gulped, realizing he’d been casual with a living legend.

“Brother, do you have girlfriends?” Jinger’s abrupt question startled him. When Guan Yu admitted multiple relationships, she accused: “Two-timing playboy!”

He defended awkwardly: “I hate hurting any of them...”

Jinger studied his conflicted eyes. “Love’s strange,” she sighed, begging for romance stories. As Guan Yu described meeting lovers through chance encounters and...unusual foot fascinations, Jinger unconsciously wiggled her pale toes.

“Love is selfish,” Guan Yu finally murmured. The heavy silence that followed lingered like unspoken truths between them.
