Guan Yu felt somewhat troubled. Zhang Han was stunningly beautiful, pretty, and adorable. If the person who had infiltrated the room was a man, under those circumstances, it would truly be hard to say what might have happened.

**Chapter 1925: What Are You Looking At?**

Zhang Han’s delicate face immediately flushed with panic. “Could it have been a perverted demon sneaking in to…to do *that* to me? Was I…violated?” She sat up, clutching her chest, her perfectly shaped fullness trembling with each movement.

Watching Zhang Han’s quivering lips and tear-filled eyes glistening like crystal, Guan Yu felt helpless. “Uncle…did a bad guy take advantage of me? Did they give me some kind of drug? Why do I feel so weak all over?”

Guan Yu’s unease deepened. Zhang Han, radiant and endearing—if the intruder had been male, the situation could have spiraled dangerously.

As Zhang Han dissolved into tears, Guan Yu found himself at a loss. He had no experience handling crying girls. What was one supposed to do?

Seeing her pitiful sobs, Guan Yu’s heart ached. After a moment’s thought, he sat beside her and said gently, “Stop crying first. Check if your body shows any signs of interference. Start by…seeing if your underwear was disturbed. If not, then perhaps nothing happened. But…”

He trailed off, unable to voice the rest. Even with her childlike demeanor, Zhang Han would understand the implication: if there *were* signs, then someone had indeed violated her.

Utterly distraught, Zhang Han mechanically lifted her pale pink nightgown, exposing herself unabashedly.

Guan Yu’s curious gaze instinctively followed—only to find nothing beneath. *This girl…sleeps like this?*

A surge of heat flooded Guan Yu’s body. He hadn’t expected her most intimate area to be so exquisitely beautiful—pale as pristine snow, flawlessly delicate. He swallowed hard, throat parched.

Wholly focused on inspecting herself, Zhang Han seemed to forget Guan Yu’s presence. To examine more thoroughly, she lay back and bent her legs, probing tentatively.

“I…think everything’s fine there. Probably untouched,” she murmured. Her movements, innocently practical to herself, sent Guan Yu reeling. He inhaled sharply, struggling to compose himself.

“Thank heavens! No signs of tampering. I’m safe.” Relaxing, Zhang Han smoothed her nightgown—only to notice Guan Yu’s wide-eyed stare fixed between her legs.

Flustered, she demanded, “Uncle! Where are you looking?!”

Guan Yu snapped back to reality, face burning crimson. Caught red-handed, he stammered, “Ah—n-nothing! Just…checking. Everything seems…fine.”

Zhang Han’s cheeks flushed scarlet. In her panic, she’d forgotten her state of undress. *He saw everything!* “Uncle! How could you…look there? You saw…*everything*!”

*This is unfair!* Guan Yu screamed internally. *She’s the one who exposed herself! Besides, wasn’t she practically offering the view?*

“Hanhan, what’s happening?” A voice called from outside—Yang Conghan had returned. *This is about to escalate.*

Yang Conghan’s elegant figure swept past Guan Yu. She’d returned early from the Yang residence to bring Zhang Han breakfast, as the maid Jinhua wasn’t present.

“What’s going on here?” Her sharp eyes took in Zhang Han’s flushed neck, translucent pink nightgown, Guan Yu’s dry lips, and the conspicuous bulge in his pants. The scene screamed impropriety.

Zhang Han seized her lifeline. “Auntie! You’re just in time! Uncle…he bullied me!” Her pitiful accusation made it sound like Guan Yu had truly assaulted her.

Noting Zhang Han’s tear-streaked face, Yang Conghan’s suspicions solidified. Zhang Han was perpetually cheerful—even when kidnapped, she’d never cried. This was alarming.

She glared at Guan Yu. “How could you?! You’re her elder! I never took you for such a monster!”

Unspoken thoughts churned: *After all this time together, he’s never touched me. I thought he was impotent—but clearly, he prefers little girls. Yet I’m youthful and sweet too… Is he exploiting her naivety for a free thrill?*

Guan Yu urgently defended himself. “Conghan, it’s not what you think! Am I that kind of person?”

“I didn’t think so before. But why are you in her room at dawn?” Yang Conghan interrogated like a prosecutor.

*This injustice could drown me in the Yellow River!* “She called me here! Why else would I rush over this early?”

Yang Conghan paused. Guan Yu’s main residence housed two stunning women. It made little sense for him to seek out Zhang Han.

“Hanhan, explain. Did you summon him?”

Though mischievous, Zhang Han recalled Guan Yu’s warnings and momentarily forgot her exposure. “I woke up weak and dizzy. You weren’t here, so I called Uncle…” She recounted the break-in.

Yang Conghan’s anger eased into concern. A intruder? This was serious. “What do we do now?”

Regaining strength, Zhang Han helped inspect the villa—nothing was stolen.

“Strange. What did the intruder want?” Guan Yu mused on the sofa. “Regardless, this place isn’t safe. Let’s relocate.”

**Chapter 1926: A Good Plan**

After moving to Qiaoyuan District’s secure villa, Zhang Han complained of lingering headaches. Guan Yu concocted a remedy—honey, vinegar, and liquor stirred together.

Xue Jing and A’Mei prepared breakfast, eyeing the odd mixture. “What’s that slop? We have ginger soup.”

“Just something for my throat,” Guan Yu lied, handing it to Zhang Han. “Drink this. It might help.”

She grimaced at the smell. “This ‘medicine’? It’s disgusting!”

“Suit yourself. Keep the headache then.”

Pinching her nose, Zhang Han choked it down. Ten minutes later, her pain vanished. “Uncle’s amazing!” she cheered, earlier modesty forgotten.

Guan Yu pondered the intruder’s motives—not theft, not assault. What then?

“They’ll return,” he concluded. “They didn’t get what they came for.”

Terrified, Zhang Han suggested changing locks. Guan Yu dismissed it—the intruder’s skills surpassed ordinary security.

Yang Conghan agreed; her high-tech fingerprint locks and alarms had been bypassed. “Hanhan should stay here. I’ll return to the Yang residence.”

“No,” Guan Yu objected. “We need to catch them. Here’s the plan: I’ll stake out Hanhan’s room tonight.”

“I’ll come too!” Zhang Han insisted. “Nowhere’s safe without Uncle!”

“You’ll distract him,” Yang Conghan warned. “What if he drugs you both?”

Reluctantly, Zhang Han relented. Guan Yu added, “Don’t wash my scent from your bed. I’ll need to mimic your presence.”

**Chapter 1927: Ambush**

That night, Guan Yu waited in Zhang Han’s overwhelmingly pink room, surrounded by snacks and girlhood. The lavish marble bathroom tempted him, but he resisted.

He reviewed the plan: lure the intruder by pretending to be Zhang Han. As midnight approached, every creak heightened his alertness. The trap was set—would the predator take the bait?
