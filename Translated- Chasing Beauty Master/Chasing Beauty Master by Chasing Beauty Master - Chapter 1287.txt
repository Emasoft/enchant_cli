Guan Yu deliberately explained loudly, ensuring many disciples who didn't understand could hear. Let them envy—it wouldn't kill anyone. Only then did numerous disciples realize Guan Yu's true prowess—he could indeed wield two magic artifacts simultaneously. Wasn't that invincible?

"Ah, so that's how it is! I've never heard of anyone using two magic artifacts together. Guan Yu, you're truly remarkable," Xiao Lian said tearfully. "But I insist this is unfair! When fighting others, you never took out both artifacts so seriously. I refuse! Put them away and fight me properly. Only then will it feel fair."

"Stop fooling around," Guan Yu replied helplessly. "How could I fight without artifacts? Besides, I never intended to battle you. I revealed them to make you retreat and admit defeat. Do you truly wish to fight me?"

"Of course!" Xiao Lian declared eagerly. "I plan to defeat you and enter the top four! Why shouldn't I fight? Just put away your artifacts and face me properly!"

Women were indeed peculiar creatures—unreasonable sophists who twisted logic. This truth manifested perfectly in Xiao Lian's current demeanor.

Guan Yu fell silent. Her words were so unreasonable that further argument would make him seem like a petty old woman. Xiao Lian wasn't wrong—during previous matches, he hadn't revealed his artifacts. Some disciples had surrendered before he even drew them.

Only during that recent night's confrontation with Elder Xiang had he employed a spell from the Imperial Seal.

Elder Dai shook his head resignedly, forcing a smile. Who could have guessed Xiao Lian harbored such ambitions—aiming for the top four? She clearly didn't realize Guan Yu could defeat her even without artifacts.

Xiao Lian pressed on, "Guan Yu, you're already outstanding and possess such fine artifacts—treasures others might never obtain in multiple lifetimes."

"Moreover, as Tiger Peak's disciple favored by the Sect Master, your cultivation will surely flourish. Why compete with ordinary disciples like us? The top four's artifact rewards must be useless to you. Don't tell me you need a second auxiliary artifact?"

Her envy shone through, particularly regarding the jade ruyi Guan Yu had gifted Siqi. That artifact was exquisite—a treasure women dreamed of possessing. Even as mere ornamentation, its beauty would captivate any maiden.

"Since the top four's rewards mean nothing to you, and you receive the Sect Master's personal guidance at Tiger Peak, you hardly need the merit cauldron's teachings. Leave these opportunities to ordinary disciples like us! What meaning is there in competing for rankings you don't need?"

Xiao Lian's arguments nearly convinced Guan Yu to turn and concede. Many disciples nodded in agreement.

**Chapter 3312: Victory Belongs to You**

Yet none imagined this was all part of the plan. Guan Yu's participation in the Six Peaks Tournament had been coerced—Xuanming forced him. Left to his own devices, he wouldn't have bothered.

"Eloquent words," Guan Yu replied solemnly. "But this is a competition, and I have orders to follow. I can't abandon my duty. Since you claim two artifacts give me unfair advantage, I'll sheath them. Satisfied?"

Storing both Soulfall Blade and Imperial Seal, he drew a small dagger. "I'll fight you with this. Fair enough?"

Xiao Lian laughed delightedly. "I knew you were a real man who values face! Thank you for understanding. Let's begin!" She rejoiced, believing Guan Yu—a two-month novice without artifacts—would be easily defeated.

Guan Yu smiled wryly at her excitement, unaware of its source. Defeating her posed no difficulty, though she remained oblivious.

The crowd never imagined Guan Yu as someone who'd abandon reason for beauty. Yet after Xiao Lian's persuasion, he'd actually sheathed his artifacts!

Many thought him foolish—without artifacts, what could a dagger achieve? But those who'd witnessed Guan Yu's blade work knew better. That unassuming knife held deadlier edge than any artifact.

Elder Dai watched amusedly, certain of Xiao Lian's defeat but withholding comment. Let Guan Yu temper her ambition.

Siqi felt inexplicably unsettled seeing Guan Yu comply with Xiao Lian's demand. Shaking her head, she couldn't identify the emotion's origin.

Xiao Zhi and Aze beamed. Having witnessed Guan Yu's prowess, they knew victory remained his even without artifacts.

"Guan Yu! Victory is yours!" Xiao Zhi shouted. Guan Yu smiled at him but ignored other Gathering Peak disciples' glares.

Xiao Zhi mentally scoffed—he'd ingratiate himself with tomorrow's Sect Master while these fools wallowed in ignorance.

Most spectators remained neutral, enjoying the spectacle regardless of outcome.

Bamboo Peak's Elder Mu eyed Guan Yu disdainfully. Initially considering him a show-off, he now saw an arrogant fool. Was this dagger-wielding display mere pretense? Intentional defeat?

Opinions split—novices thought Guan Yu overreached, while Left Void Peak disciples who knew his capabilities thought otherwise.

Xuanming observed calmly, finding no fault. Revealing two artifacts earlier had been wise—it elevated Guan Yu's status. Now fighting with a dagger after dazzling the crowd? Equally acceptable. Though pained by parting with high-grade artifacts, he consoled himself that Guan Yu would bring glory to Cloud Azure Sect with them.

**Chapter 3313: Cheating**

When the match commenced, Xiao Lian immediately unleashed Thunderclap Art—similar to Siqi's lightning technique but weaker. Whereas Siqi summoned storm clouds, Xiao Lian produced mere twin sparks.

This illustrated their cultivation gap—both used the same art, but Xiao Lian's remained elementary.

Guan Yu resolved to humor her first. Let her enjoy casting spells while he evaded.

Lightning streaked from Xiao Lian's Cloud Azure Sword. Smiling triumphantly, she directed the bolts at Guan Yu—only to watch them pierce empty air and shatter a wooden post.

Bewildered, she turned to find Guan Yu smiling nearby. "Xiao Lian, I'm here! Was your target unclear? Why attack wood?"

"Impossible! You cheated!" she cried. "You were right there! How did you become wood?!"

In her excitement, she'd missed Guan Yu's movement. "Watch carefully this time," he teased.

Xiao Lian angrily bit her lip and cast again. As lightning flew, Guan Yu vanished once more—this time striking the protective barrier.

Before she could protest, cold steel touched her neck. Guan Yu stood beside her, dagger poised. "Seems you've lost."

"You cheated! You used artifacts secretly!" she accused. "Otherwise my spells would've hit!"

"Whether I cheated is for referees to decide," Guan Yu replied. "Your eagerness blinded you."

He'd halved their five-meter distance with his first dodge. Three meters became nothing for his speed.

"Rematch! You definitely cheated!" Xiao Lian insisted, knowing he wouldn't kill her.

"I used no artifacts. Everyone here can attest." Guan Yu spread his hands. The crowd knew the truth—he'd relied purely on speed.

"Our match's validity depends on the referee," he added.

"But the Sect Master's your master! He'll side with you!" Xiao Lian blurted, immediately regretting it as jeers erupted. Defeated, she conceded—the top four remained beyond reach.

**Chapter 3314: Ingratitude**

As Xiao Lian retreated, Xuanming announced without reprimand: "This match's victor is Tiger Peak's Guan Yu! Congratulations on entering the top four!"

Xiao Zhi and Aze rushed to celebrate while Siqi concealed her quiet joy. Their public camaraderie signaled close ties with Cloud Azure's future leader—exactly as Elder Zheng instructed.

Only one match remained. Xuanming declared: "The final bout for the last top four spot—Suspended Peak's Aze versus Tiger Peak's Ling Su!"

Though favoring Ling Su, Xuanming worried—if Aze won, he'd lose another artifact. Ideally, his disciples Guan Yu, Ling Su, Siqi, and Lin Chen should have dominated the top four, sparing his treasures.

Xiao Zhi joked as Aze returned to stage: "Should've stayed up there!"

"Don't worry," Aze assured. "Remember last night's strategy—verbal attacks and guerilla tactics."

Guan Yu nodded. "Victory is yours."

Xuanming overheard, displeased by Guan Yu supporting outsiders against Tiger Peak. His ideal four—all his disciples—would have saved artifacts. Yet protocol demanded fairness. At least Xiao Zhi's victory would please Elder Zheng.

Observing Aze's calm demeanor, Xuanming grew puzzled. The Suspended Peak disciple showed no fear facing Ling Su's superior cultivation. What trickery brewed?
