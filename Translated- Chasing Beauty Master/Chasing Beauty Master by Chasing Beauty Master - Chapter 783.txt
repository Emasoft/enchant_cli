“You might not know this,” Guan Yu said with a smile, “but when my memories were sealed in the ice cavern back then, most of my cultivation was also suppressed. So what you saw earlier was my full strength.”

Jones nodded in understanding, chiding himself for underestimating the situation. Had Ji Ge not been posturing earlier and fought seriously, the outcome would have been uncertain.

“However,” Guan Yu continued, “I’ve noticed my cultivation is gradually changing now—far stronger than when I first lost my memories. I can’t explain why.”

Jones suggested they investigate this matter later, as their immediate priority was to see if anyone else would step forward to challenge Guan Yu.

After a prolonged silence, no one volunteered. Though many disapproved of Jones’ methods, none wished to face Guan Yu’s overwhelming power. Thus, through demonstrated strength, Guan Yu ascended as the Second Leader of the Freedom Organization.

To celebrate, a grand banquet was held that evening in honor of Guan Yu’s induction.

After joining, Guan Yu gradually learned about the organization’s operations. Their base lay beneath a five-story department store on West Ping’an Street, owned by Jones. The building’s upper floors operated as a regular shopping center, while the three subterranean levels served as the organization’s headquarters.

Though not in the city center, the area bustled with residential complexes and steady foot traffic. The department store thrived as a commercial hub.

In Jones’ office, Guan Yu leafed through a thick rulebook and groaned, “Who could memorize all these regulations?”

“Memorize them or not,” Jones retorted, “violations carry penalties. As an underground organization, strict discipline is essential to prevent chaos.”

Guan Yu acknowledged the logic—clandestine groups earning illicit profits required secrecy and rigid oversight. Notably, China forbade private异能者organizations of this scale, fearing their potential to rival state power. Yet such groups survived by cultivating connections within the federal government.

Tossing the rulebook aside, Guan Yu declared, “You press-ganged me into this Second Leader role, Jones. Handle the organization’s affairs yourself—I want no part of this.”

“Very well,” Jones chuckled. “I knew you valued freedom. Rest assured, organizational matters won’t burden you.”

Thus, Guan Yu became a figurehead leader, his status nominally elevated. The Freedom Organization operated among numerous异能者groups proliferating globally as nations recruited cultivators to bolster their strength.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District with Jones, Guan Yu found five police cars parked outside his residence. Xue Yingfeng stood arguing with an officer when someone spotted Guan Yu and shouted, “There he is!”

Twenty armed officers immediately surrounded Guan Yu. “You’re suspected of kidnapping, assault, and intentional injury,” one announced, guns trained on him. “Cooperate with our investigation.”

“Wait!” A white sports car screeched to a halt nearby. Out stepped Su Xiaojuan, a stunningly beautiful woman. “Don’t obstruct justice,” an officer warned.

“Obstruct your head! Sun Heizi accuses Guan Yu, so you come like obedient dogs? Is he your daddy?” Xiaojuan snapped, noticing Guan Yu’s darkening expression. She feared he might attack the officers, escalating tensions.

These elite SWAT officers from Beijing had been mobilized through Sun Heizi’s connections after Xue Yingfeng’s earlier confrontation. Their orders: apprehend the “extremely dangerous” Guan Yu.

“Where are these officers from?” Liu Shilei asked, emerging from another car.

“Beijing SWAT,” Xue replied. “Sun bypassed local channels.”

“Beijing cops think they can arrest anyone?” Xiaojuan retorted. “How much did Sun bribe you?”

“Slanderous claims will be prosecuted,” the squad leader warned.

Xiaojuan jabbed a finger at his face. “Prosecute this! Where’s your evidence? None? Then you’re the ones committing crimes!” She dialed her phone while the flustered leader contacted his superior.

“Just arrest him! We’ll find evidence later,” ordered Sun’s corrupt cousin, the Beijing Bureau Chief. As officers moved to seize Guan Yu, Xiaojuan snatched the leader’s phone and threatened the Chief: “I’m Du Xiaojuan, HuaYu Group’s Vice Chair. Your career ends today unless you withdraw.”

The Chief panicked upon recognizing her influence. HuaYu’s connections reached the highest echelons. When Guan Yu suddenly disarmed the leader with a thrown dagger and sent him flying with a punch, chaos erupted.

“Calm down!” Xiaojuan gripped Guan Yu’s fist as guns pressed against his head. “They’re not worth it.” Her timely intervention prevented bloodshed.

A phone call from military intelligence soon forced the police retreat. “Remember this, Captain,” Guan Yu warned the battered leader. “Next time we meet, you’d better be unemployed.”

**Chapter 1987: Slanderous Accusations**

As officers departed shamefacedly, Xiaojuan guided everyone inside. Introducing Jones as his Arctic expedition companion, Guan Yu faced Liu Shilei’s arched brow: “Another sister?”

“Not another—she’s been part of this from the start,” Xue Jing clarified, serving fruits. The women welcomed Jones warmly, though tensions lingered beneath the courtesy.

**Chapter 1988: Counterfeit Liquor**

The disgraced police captain led his humiliated team away, knowing his career hung by a thread. Xiaojuan prioritized targeting Sun Heizi over petty officers. “Brainless fools,” Guan Yu spat as cars vanished. “Should’ve done their homework.”

Inside, normality feigned resumed. Yet all knew this confrontation was merely the opening move in a deeper game—one where Sun Heizi’s desperation would soon manifest in darker schemes.
