“We’ve investigated the film crew members. Some of their statements align with those of Guan Yu and Niu Le. However…”

“However what?” Director Nie slowly raised his head, his face expressionless as he inquired.

“Ahem… After Deputy Director Li received the report for this case, he gave specific instructions. Therefore, we haven’t yet taken the statement from the involved party, Miss Gao Wei. Also, this Piao Xu (Park Xu) is the young master of the Sanxie Group. There’s…” Deputy Team Leader Jiang scratched his head awkwardly, his words trailing off ambiguously.

Deputy Director Li? He’s meddling in this too! The Sanxie Group’s reach is absurdly long! But have they truly forgotten that I, the legitimate director, am still sitting here? This place still bears the Nie surname, damn it!

**Chapter 356: Intricate Entanglements**

Director Nie narrowed his eyes, his smile betraying no emotion. “Proceed according to standard investigation and evidence collection protocols. This case will be handled by you, Jiang Xun! Pay no heed to any ‘groups.’ We must handle the case based on facts, understood? We cannot wrong the innocent, nor let any criminal escape! I’ve heard this case arose from premeditated murder. It’s crucial to interview the involved parties and understand the situation. Keep me updated on all developments!”

“Understood!” Deputy Jiang snapped to attention, his voice crisp.

The boss is about to flex his authority—this is a direct challenge to Deputy Director Li’s faction! Deputy Jiang’s heart surged with covert excitement. Being entrusted with this task at such a pivotal moment meant that satisfying the boss could secure his position in Director Nie’s camp and propel him into the spotlight!

Bureaucratic institutions were labyrinths of intrigue, where power struggles were commonplace.

Having discerned Director Nie’s intentions, Deputy Jiang wasted no time. The moment Nie and his entourage turned to leave, he eagerly seized Guan Yu’s phone and hurried to the detention room.

With brisk efficiency, he removed Guan Yu’s handcuffs, brought over two chairs, and sat facing him.

“Brother Jiang, isn’t this improper?” Liu Jili flickered a glance at Guan Yu, whispering a reminder.

“We need Miss Gao Wei to come here for questioning. Aside from Guan Yu, do you have her number? Can you bear the responsibility if the investigation stalls? Xiao Liu, I must say—your attitude toward handling cases is utterly immature!” Deputy Jiang’s face hardened as he rebuked him in a low voice.

Liu Jili craned his neck, staring at Jiang Xun in bewilderment. Had this fat *** lost his mind? His own cousin was Jiang’s superior! Since when did this bastard dare lecture him?

With a furious swipe of his hand, Liu Jili stormed out.

“Ignore him. That brat knows nothing—all bluster! He’ll crash headfirst into a wall sooner or later!” Jiang Xun chuckled, nodding at Guan Yu.

“No matter… Once this case concludes, I’ll send him inside. Prisoners particularly enjoy guards who’ve lost their uniforms. Isn’t that right?” Guan Yu smiled faintly, raising an eyebrow.

Jiang Xun awkwardly adjusted his hat brim, a chill prickling his scalp. This kid radiated an unsettling aura.

Guan Yu called Gao Wei. Overjoyed, she anxiously asked about his situation. Upon learning the police needed her statement, she readily agreed.

The moment she hung up, her phone rang again—her entertainment company’s CEO.

“Hello, President Cui. This is Gao Wei.”

“What? How can that be! Piao Xu genuinely tried to kill me! I have evidence of his motive!”

“No! I won’t do this!” Stamping her foot, her delicate face frosty, Gao Wei refused vehemently.

“If not for Guan Yu, I’d be dead! He’s embroiled in legal trouble because of me—I must clear his name. I won’t commit perjury, but I’ll present the truth!”

“Offending the Sanxie Group? That’s the company’s concern, not mine as a contracted artist! If President Cui finds my actions inappropriate, we can negotiate terminating my contract. Goodbye!” She hung up angrily.

The rich always shield the rich! Her own company had business ties with the Sanxie Group, a Japanese conglomerate! Worse, they pressured her to falsify testimony.

Unthinkable! Gao Wei pursed her lips, seething.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu received news from Li Yunshan, who had flown to Provincial Secretary Rong’s office. Bypassing city officials and Director Nie, Li Yunshan went straight to the provincial Party Secretary.

After hearing Li’s account, Secretary Rong agreed to look into the matter. His hesitant demeanor hinted at higher forces at play. Li Yunshan promptly called Guan Yu, urging patience as he continued maneuvering.

“I’m fine here! Protect Niu Le at all costs! Spare no expense—I’ll repay every penny! If favors are needed, I’ll return them doubly! Just keep him safe—it’s non-negotiable!” Guan Yu gripped his phone, speaking solemnly.

“Understood. Don’t worry!” Hanging up, Li Yunshan slammed his steering wheel. He’d judged rightly—Guan Yu was loyalty incarnate! Others would’ve abandoned allies to save themselves in such a mess!

After several calls, Guan Yu updated his contacts. Feng Xin was discussing the case with Director Nie, who unexpectedly took the phone to reassure Guan Yu.

“Brother Guan, rest assured! Though this case involves complex interests, you’ll receive fair treatment! Regardless of pressure, I’ll oversee this personally for the old Commissioner’s sake! You may need to endure a few days of hardship.”

“No problem… I’m thick-skinned—even jail doesn’t faze me! But please watch over my brother, Niu Le.”

“Understood!” Director Nie agreed heartily.

Meanwhile, Liu Jili’s cousin, Squad Leader Liu Jichang, was in the Deputy Director’s office discussing Guan Yu’s case.

“The Governor’s four urban development projects are joint ventures with Sanxie Group. This brat assaulted their young master and killed a bodyguard—the implications are massive!” Deputy Director Li smoked leisurely, his tone conspiratorial.

“But Director Nie clearly backs their opposition. He assigned Jiang Xun to lead the case, bypassing me. My brother suffered humiliation under Jiang…”

“Patience… Let them investigate. When upper pressure mounts, the case will fall to you. Keep your approach… flexible.” Deputy Director Li stubbed out his cigarette, smiling faintly.

**Chapter 357: Who Will Prevail?**

The case dragged through the night… Despite efforts from Li Yunshan, Feng Xin, and Elder Liu’s factions, no swift resolution emerged.

The Governor called, berating Director Nie, while the Provincial Secretary phoned encouragement. Lying awake, Nie felt his head might burst.

How did Guan Yu, a mere student, entangle himself in a murder case involving J City’s power players?

After deliberation, Nie gritted his teeth. He’d stand by Guan Yu. Current odds seemed against them, but factual documentation now could shift blame later when the titans clashed.

If the Provincial Secretary triumphed over the Governor, Guan Yu and Niu Le would walk free under self-defense. If the Governor won, both faced decade-long sentences.

Jiang Xun completed Gao Wei’s testimony overnight, aligning with Nie’s strategy.

By dawn, no verdict emerged. The police chiefs’ covert struggle awaited their superiors’ decision to strike.

Nie knew the odds. The newly appointed Provincial Secretary lacked the Governor’s entrenched power. Only Elder Liu’s influence eased pressure from provincial authorities.

They could only wait—the outcome hinged on higher machinations.

Li Yunshan scrambled connections across J Province, his confidence waning. This battle exceeded his reach as a mere businessman. To bind the Provincial Secretary’s support, he needed a grand gesture—a massive investment under the Secretary’s banner.

Ten billion yuan—his financial limit—might sway things. Though dwarfed by Sanxie’s resources, it was his all-in gamble. Guan Yu’s uncanny ability to generate wealth (nearly 200 million from a Yunnan trip!) made the risk worthwhile. Forging a life-death bond with him could propel Li’s company to global prominence.

Another day passed in eerie calm. No calls from the Governor or Secretary. The stalemate held.

That evening, after chain-smoking half a pack, Director Nie summoned Jiang Xun to transfer Guan Yu and Niu Le to detention.

Defeat shadowed Nie’s face. Without upper-echelon resolution, he had to send them to harsher custody. Though he’d arranged minor comforts, prison life would be brutal.

“Brother… I’ve done all I can. Against those above, my rank is insignificant. These three days… I’m sorry. You’ll be transferred to detention pending developments.”

In truth, Piao Xu’s recordings and Gao Wei’s testimony sufficed for self-defense claims. But entangled interests muddied legal clarity.

Guan Yu shook Nie’s hand calmly. “No apologies needed. It’s not over till it’s over. Who knows where the deer will fall?”

**Chapter 358: Money Can’t Buy Shit**

Though detained, Jiang Xun’s covert aid kept Guan Yu connected. He knew the stakes—a student thrust into provincial power struggles! At worst, prison awaited. With his supernatural gifts, he’d rebound stronger.

But Niu Le’s fate pained him. The hotheaded ally’s prior scrapes paled against this calamity. Even Feng Xin and Elder Liu’s combined efforts faltered against Sanxie’s onslaught.

Money—it always circled back to money! If his wealth surpassed Sanxie’s, outcomes might differ.

Escorted out, Director Nie clasped Guan Yu’s shoulder. “I’ve notified them. You’ll be treated fairly. But detention’s full of snakes—watch your back.”

Guan Yu chuckled, handcuffed hands waving dismissively as he entered the police van.

Niu Le plopped beside him. “Hey officer, where we headed? Execution ground?”

Jiang Xun smirked. “To paradise. You’ll see!” Up front, Liu Jili glared but held his tongue.
