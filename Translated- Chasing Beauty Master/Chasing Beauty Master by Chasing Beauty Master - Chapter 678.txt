Guan Yu had no time to marvel at the Creator's wonders. He swiftly used his spiritual sense to shield his brain, enveloping that strand of electromagnetic wave and gently moving it out from within his cerebral cortex, hiding it in a tiny groove of the brain's surface.

Everyone in the outer room stared at the computer screens. When they initially saw the feedback information from Guan Yu's brain showing little difference from previous test subjects, disappointment crossed their faces—including the elderly scientist—assuming Guan Yu would follow others into madness from the explosive cerebral impacts.

Yet to their astonishment, within a mere second, the tornado-like violent force vanished completely. The brain imagery onscreen transitioned from crimson back to normal green.

Watanabe frowned. "Success? Failure?"

Previous subjects' brain images would progressively redden until deep crimson madness ensued. Never had they witnessed colors reverting like this. Watanabe couldn't determine the outcome.

The elderly scientist ventured, "It should be considered successful."

As he spoke, his entire body suddenly convulsed as if electrocuted. His face paled before collapsing limply.

Watanabe jolted in shock. Before he could inquire, a golden light streaked into his mind, felling him identically.

Inoue recoiled, hands raised defensively. "Who's there?"

Some Eastern Island mutants possessed invisibility powers like Yu Zhengchun. Inoue assumed stealthy attackers were present. But moments later, Inoue and the second-class mutant similarly trembled and fell—invaded by Guan Yu's reversed spiritual sense. The difference lay only in endurance: second-class mutants lasted longer than Watanabe, first-class slightly more.

A shadow flickered as Guan Yu materialized in the room, smiling at the fallen Eastern Islanders.

Though the electromagnetic wave intrusion posed risks, Guan Yu had deciphered the so-called "brain modification system's" principles. Redirecting his spiritual sense, he transformed Watanabe's group instead.

After ten minutes, Watanabe's party gradually awoke.

Undeniably formidable, these Eastern Islanders' system resembled mobile software—Guan Yu as server, they as terminals. Upon awakening like booted computers, their entire beings etched themselves into Guan Yu's consciousness: current confusion, burgeoning awe, and inexplicable loyalty.

Guan Yu marveled at humanity's mysteries. Even at divine-level cultivation, human physiology remained elusive. That electromagnetic strand revealed the brain's staggering latent power—yet both body and mind remained 99.9999% untapped. He now knew he could elevate anyone here—even the frail elder—to first-class mutant capacity.

Original first-class mutant Inoue's potential capped near that mysterious woman by Takashi's side.

Communication required no speech—direct spiritual commands sufficed for instant obedience.

Guan Yu mentally ordered Watanabe's group: maintain normal operations but report to Ito and the Divine Emperor that the experiment failed—Guan Yu went mad and was eliminated. The flawed brain modification system needed refinement.

**Chapter 1723: Peaceful Departure**

Watanabe's group now existed as Guan Yu's puppets—suicidally obedient if commanded. Yet Guan Yu chose to leave them embedded in Eastern Island as sleeper agents. Premature exposure served none. Current events revealed Eastern Island's brewing grand conspiracy, first target likely China.

Future Sino-Eastern Island conflicts seemed inevitable, driven by a powerful minority steering the nation's course. Guan Yu sought minimal collateral damage—thus planting this chess piece.

Under orders, Inoue summoned an ordinary Watanabe Society member. Guan Yu shapeshifted into his likeness using qi before Inoue crushed the man's skull. Dragging the disfigured corpse outside, Guan Yu ordered perimeter underlings to bury it, then returned underground.

Though unaware of specifics, Sakura witnessed everything through shared consciousness. Seeing him enter, she rushed to the cage. "Guan Yu, are you okay?"

Knowing his safety yet needing confirmation, she finally smiled when reassured. Under her gaze, Guan Yu entered the cage—metal bars illusory before him. Taking her hand, they exited as bars liquefied around Sakura before solidifying again.

Exiting the compound, guards obeyed Watanabe's order to release Sakura. Returning to Takashi Corporation, her father—mid-calls seeking help—assumed connections succeeded, suspecting nothing.

Sakura's sports car awaited. After hotel drop-off, Guan Yu retired while Sakura worked. From Watanabe's memories: Divine Emperor's palace—surrounded by moats on Green Island—housed the weapons. Modern skyscrapers encircled this traditional Eastern Island oasis of low white-walled buildings with bronze pillars.

Nightfall suited the palace infiltration. Morning cultivation, lunch with Sakura, afternoon urban exploration—Guan Yu pondered: did ordinary Eastern Islanders truly support extremist "national revival" rhetoric, or was this mere pretext for personal ambitions?

At 5 PM, Sakura called—inviting him to Eastern Island's premier French restaurant. Though baffled by non-Chinese cuisine's appeal, he indulged her.

Seated amidst candlelit ambiance, Sakura agonized over menus until finally ordering. Guan Yu endured the ceremonial dining—back stiffening until Sakura blew a kiss: "Just this once! Next time, Chinese food!"

He sensed her unspoken agenda. When the waiter served sherry, Sakura paled—spotting an unwelcome figure.

**Chapter 1724: Jealous Confrontation**

Without turning, Guan Yu's spiritual sense identified the newcomer: a 28-year-old Eastern Islander—tall at 1.8m, lean build, angular features betraying ruthlessness. Spotting Sakura, the man stormed over—a second-class mutant's aura radiating.

Sakura whispered urgently, "It's Hayakawa Shigeru! He'll cause trouble!"

Guan Yu leisurely squeezed lemon on oysters. "This restaurant's excellent. Try some."

Hayakawa loomed behind Guan Yu. "Sakura! Why ignore my calls? I heard you were captured over some Chinese! Yet here you dine—why not inform me?"

Sakura stepped on Guan Yu's foot under the table. "We're just friends, Hayakawa. My father resolved the misunderstanding. None of your concern."

Guan Yu finally wiped his lips. "Sir, ever heard of love at first sight? Twenty years without success suggests you never will. Leave before embarrassment."

Hayakawa's face whitened. "You dare mock me? Some tourist thinks he can steal what's mine?"

Sakura interjected coldly, "I choose whom I love. Now leave us."

The restaurant's atmosphere crackled—patrons glancing over as mutant energy simmered. Guan Yu prepared for theatrics, discreetly shielding nearby diners with qi. This Eastern Island drama was about to crescendo.
