“Hey, you little brat… You really look down on this old man! Come… Let me show you something! Get ready—I’m attacking!” The old man wearing slippers and a bath towel around his waist swung his arm and stood earnestly before Guan Yu.

“Old Master, let’s… let’s not joke around. The floor’s slippery!” Guan Yu waved his hands frantically, trying to dissuade him. This was no laughing matter! If the old man stumbled and fell before him, there’d be no explaining it away. Already saddled with over twenty thousand in debt, if this geezer ended up hospitalized because of him… Damn, he’d be stuck working as a bodyguard for life to pay it off!

Though Guan Yu kept waving his hands in protest, Old Master Feng abruptly lunged sideways and struck like a viper’s tongue—a fist hurtling straight for Guan Yu’s face.

The speed stunned Guan Yu. Before he could react, the punch whistled through the air!

Yet despite the blistering speed, Guan Yu’s reflexes proved formidable. Without even seeing where the fist aimed, he instinctively twisted aside, dodging just in time.

But evading that single blow left him utterly overwhelmed by the ensuing storm of attacks. Blocking and weaving frantically, he staggered back three or four steps in mere moments.

Within seconds, Guan Yu lost count of the hits—his nose, cheeks, chest, and stomach burned with pain. Leaning backward to avoid another strike, he nearly toppled over.

Just as the old man’s assault seemed to slow slightly, giving Guan Yu a split-second to activate his Gravity Manipulation and regain balance, Master Feng’s foot hooked around his ankle. Simultaneously, the old man pivoted and drove a thunderous uppercut into Guan Yu’s chin.

Activating weight reduction mid-fall did nothing—the punch slammed Guan Yu flat onto the floor.

That final blow shocked him to the core. Though the earlier strikes were swift and precise, their force felt restrained, targeting vulnerable spots like eyes and throat where minimal strength sufficed. Yet in those frantic seconds of evasion, Guan Yu had been herded into a trap—the decisive sweep and punch perfectly timed to exploit his imbalance.

No chance to block or dodge. He’d watched helplessly as that fist arced toward his jaw.

Clambering up, Guan Yu clutched his throbbing chin and glared at the old man. Damn! This was an octogenarian? He’d just floored a twenty-year-old in seconds!

What the hell—was this geezer some hidden martial arts master? Guan Yu’s mind reeled.

“Well? How does that feel?” Old Master Feng clapped his hands, smirking arrogantly.

“Uh… not bad, old timer,” Guan Yu mumbled, though inwardly不服. His strength lay in initiating attacks. If he struck first, victory wasn’t guaranteed! With Gravity Manipulation’s alternating pressure shifts, his explosive power was no joke.

Noticing his expression, the old man raised an eyebrow mockingly. “What? Little brat, that look says you’re不服. Come—show me your opening move!”

Initially hesitant, Guan Yu now burned with curiosity after witnessing the old man’s flurry. He’d take the first strike!

**Chapter 67: Apprenticeship**

Rolling his shoulders, Guan Yu nodded and assumed a combat stance.

Activating Gravity Manipulation, he shot forward like a dragon bursting from its lair—a lightning jab aimed at the old man’s chest. He’d chosen this target to avoid injuring the elder, holding back his full weight-enhanced force that might shatter an eighty-year-old’s body.

Yet even with reduced gravity accelerating his punch to blinding speed, the old man’s counterstrike was faster—a crisp blow to Guan Yu’s nose before his fist even grazed the old man’s robe. As Guan Yu thrust forward, Master Feng’s torso concave避让 while his own fist snapped out with rehearsed precision.

“Again…” The old man grinned挑衅ly.

Damn—couldn’t even beat a senior citizen? Guan Yu stepped back, then swung a wild haymaker at the old man’s face.

A staccato of impacts echoed as another rapid combo battered Guan Yu backward. Just as he teetered off-balance, that familiar loaded punch hammered down onto his forehead with a resounding *thud*.

Ears ringing, Guan Yu sat dazed on the floor before staggering up, awestruck.

“See? Still green. Brute force alone won’t cut it. You’ve much to learn.”

Thoroughly humbled, Guan Yu nodded obsequiously, absorbing the lesson.

*This old fox is something else!* he marveled inwardly.

“True Chinese martial arts have long faded,” the old man lectured. “What remains are crude imitations—external硬气功, while internal energy cultivation vanishes. Nowadays, no matter your skill, a bullet trumps all. But that doesn’t render combat useless! Close-quarters tactics—grappling, locks—still surpass firearms in melee. My own skills are but foundational; true mastery of speed eludes me.”

Guan Yu nodded blankly, lost in the speech.

“Knowledge is endless. In martial arts, nothing withstands absolute speed. Merge velocity with power, and one strike suffices. Yet in my lifetime, I’ve never met such a master.”

Guan Yu’s eyes shone. *Should I apprentice myself? But hermits like him rarely take students… How to impress him?*

Meanwhile, Old Master Feng studied him with an inscrutable smile.

“You’re absolutely right, sir!” Guan Yu declared earnestly. “For a bodyguard like me, skill means protecting others effectively. If I’m weak, I endanger everyone!”

“True enough,” the old man agreed. “Those martial studios teach worthless flourishes.”

“Exactly! Masters like you are vanishingly rare. Finding a teacher’s near impossible!” Guan Yu sighed theatrically.

“Then… perhaps you’d teach me? Let me become your disciple!”

“Hmm…” The old man stroked his chin, feigning reluctance.

“Consider—if I grow stronger, your granddaughter gains an extra layer of protection! As her bodyguard, my improvement safeguards her. I’ll learn diligently for Miss Feng’s sake!” Guan Yu vowed, pounding his chest.

“Well… when you put it that way… I’ve never taken apprentices, but perhaps an exception…”

“Perfect! A win-win!” Guan Yu bobbed his head, inwardly exultant. *That easy? The old coot must be desperate for a worthy successor!*

With exaggerated gravitas, Master Feng nodded. “Tomorrow morning, call Xīn丫头 to bring you. We’ll begin then.”

“Deal!” Guan Yu beamed, marveling at his luck. *The old man must’ve spotted my talent!*

Swaggering out of Diya Entertainment City, the smug youth failed to notice two elderly figures chuckling on a sofa.

“The rascal’s cunning,” Master Feng snorted. “Uses my granddaughter as pretext to learn my arts!”

“Admit it, you old fox,” teased bespectacled Elder Xu. “You’re grooming a grandson-in-law! Fine lad. Tomorrow I’ll bring my antiques for his appraisal.”

“Quit that fake眼镜!” Feng retorted. “No myopia nor presbyopia—why play scholar? Ex-bandit collecting trinkets! How many forgeries have you bought?”

“Nonsense!” Xu reddened. “Even experts err occasionally!”

“Sure, sure,” Feng rolled his eyes.

“Hypocrite! Your Bone-Breaking Fist lineage dies without male heirs. You’re desperate—using the boy to secure both successor and granddaughter’s future!”

Feng sighed. “True… If I die, this art vanishes. Want to kneel and beg apprenticeship?”

The two bickered like children, their laughter echoing.

**Chapter 68: Filling the Coffers**

Returning home, Guan Yu fed his two pet pigeons, too excited to sleep. Who’d have thought vengeance would lead to a martial sage?

Despite dangers faced, his revenge mission succeeded—emerging unscathed thanks to异能, becoming a gang leader’s bodyguard, and gaining a master!

If told months prior about gravity control, telepathy, animal speech, and healing, he’d have called it madness. Yet here he was, wielding these powers effortlessly.

Master Feng’s skill awed him—an octogenarian flooring him in seconds, clearly holding back. Combining those techniques with Gravity Manipulation promised terrifying synergy.

But pressing matters remained: Wang Fubīn’s retaliation. Would he report to police? Continuous beatings might deter him, but required financial backing—wealth to bribe or flee if needed.

Priority one: fatten his wallet. Tomorrow, he’d hit the lottery—quickest cash source. Healing or antiques required capital he lacked.

Dawn found Guan Yu playing with his pigeons before heading out. At a modest彩票站, he lit a cigarette and activated clairvoyance on the ticket stacks.

Most held paltry sums, but one offered ¥1,000. Sighing, he pointed. “That batch, please.”

The店主 handed it over. Guan Yu’s mind raced—this meager prize wouldn’t suffice. Yet perhaps…
