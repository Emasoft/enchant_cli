“Father, can you please not be so impulsive?” Wang Xiaorong pleaded. “At your age, pursuing a wounded man is beneath you. Moreover, Guan Yu is your junior. If word spreads of this, it will tarnish your reputation.”

Chapter 3390: Change of Mind

The Demon Lord paused, glancing at his daughter. “What’s wrong with you? Why interfere when I seek to capture Guan Yu? Besides, I never said I’d go personally.”

Wang Xiaorong flushed, realizing her urgency might betray her feelings. If her father discovered her affection for Guan Yu, all would be lost.

“Father, don’t you see Guan Yu’s importance to us?”

“Of course he matters,” the Demon Lord declared coldly. “He has two choices—swear allegiance to the Demon Soul Sect or die. I’ll never tolerate his existence. And you—stay away from him. He belongs to a different world and may become our greatest enemy. Abandon any foolish notions about him.”

Wang Xiaorong denied hastily, “I harbor no such thoughts! Don’t accuse me unjustly!”

“I raised you. Did you think I wouldn’t notice?” The Demon Lord’s gaze sharpened. “You’ve never pleaded for a man before. After spending mere days with Guan Yu, you defend him so fiercely. Do you take me for a fool?”

Knowing deception was futile, Wang Xiaorong chose another angle. “Guan Yu is the youngest disciple of Cloud Azure Sect. If you move against him openly, it will provoke their retaliation and jeopardize our grand plans. Have you considered that?”

“No!” The Demon Lord slammed his fist. “A dual cultivator of demonic and orthodox arts cannot be allowed to rise. His potential threat is too great. He must be eliminated—now.”

Wang Xiaorong’s intervention had only hardened his resolve. Desperate, she changed tactics. “Father, there’s something far more urgent than Guan Yu.”

“Oh? Speak.”

Seizing the chance to divert him, she produced the Bat Token and Life-Extending Antidote from Black Blood Ridge. “Look what I’ve obtained!”

“The Bat Token?” The Demon Lord’s eyes widened. “Then the Blood Lord…”

“Is dead.” Wang Xiaorong smiled triumphantly. “Guan Yu and I destroyed Black Blood Ridge. During the final battle, he slew the Blood Lord with a hidden weapon. I retrieved these from the corpse.”

“Guan Yu defeated the Blood Lord? So the legends of dual cultivation are true…”

“They joined forces to subdue him,” she clarified. “But Guan Yu delivered the killing blow. These tokens are ours now.”

“Excellent!” The Demon Lord clutched the Bat Token. “With this, we can rally Black Blood Ridge’s remnants to our cause. Our strength will multiply!”

“There’s more.” She handed him the antidote—a vial of irregular black pills, each no larger than five millimeters.

After sniffing a pill, the Demon Lord laughed. “The Life-Extending Antidote! With this, we control all who depended on the Blood Lord’s mercy. You’ve surpassed my decades of labor in a single stroke!”

“Father, Cloud Azure Sect has a mole—Senior Brother Qi. He’s secretly affiliated with Black Blood Ridge and will die without these pills. If we approach him, he’ll become our spy. Rumor says he’s Xuanming’s favorite disciple.”

“Splendid! The day of our dominion nears.”

Seizing the moment, Wang Xiaorong added, “These treasures came from Guan Yu. He could have claimed glory for Cloud Azure Sect, yet he gave them to us. How can we repay his generosity with violence?”

“Why would he surrender such prizes?”

“Out of gratitude. Unlike other hypocritical ‘righteous’ cultivators, he treats demonic practitioners fairly. He’s... different.”

The Demon Lord narrowed his eyes. “You scheme to spare him again.”

“Think strategically!” she pressed. “A rare talent like Guan Yu shouldn’t be wasted. Let me persuade him to join us. If he resists, you can kill him later. For now, focus on consolidating Black Blood Ridge’s forces.”

After a long pause, the Demon Lord relented. “Very well. Approach him, earn his trust. But if he remains obstinate…”

“He won’t. He’s only been at Cloud Azure Sect for three months—not yet indoctrinated. I’ll succeed.”

Chapter 3391: Hidden Intentions (Part 1)

The plan settled, the Demon Lord departed to mobilize their new allies. Meanwhile, in Cloud Azure Sect’s Tiger Head Peak Hall, Senior Brother Qi stood before the gathered elders with an unconscious Xiaotong.

“Explain,” demanded Xuanming, the sect master.

Qi fabricated smoothly, “While undercover at Black Blood Ridge, I discovered Xiaotong captured as bait for Guan Yu. Instead of rescuing her, Guan Yu vanished in Qujiang City. Later, he recklessly stormed the stronghold with a demonic ally—Wang Xiaorong, the Demon Soul Sect’s heir. Their incompetence nearly got everyone killed. I subdued the Blood Lord and escaped with Xiaotong.”

Elder Lu frowned. “Guan Yu is prudent. This contradicts his nature.”

“Anxiety clouded his judgment,” Qi lied. “His companions gambled and drank instead of preparing. The swordsman Zhi Lang drunkenly challenged the Blood Lord, endangering all. I alone stabilized the situation.”

Elder Dai sprang up. “What of Sisi? Is she injured?”

“We separated during the retreat. Her condition is unknown.”

Elder Lu’s voice turned icy. “By your account, Guan Yu bears all blame while you claim all merit?”

Qi feigned humility. “I merely report facts. Discipline rests with the elders.”

Elder Zheng snorted. “We’ll decide punishments. Your overzealousness is noted.”

Chapter 3392: Lies Exposed (Part 2)

Elder Xiang, long hostile toward Guan Yu, gloated. “Qi’s achievements are undeniable. When the others return, they’ll face bamboo forest discipline!”

Yet doubts lingered. Elder Lu pressed, “Describe the battle against the Blood Lord.”

Panicking inwardly, Qi invented details, unaware that Xiaotong’s awakening would soon unravel his deceit.

“Guan Yu colluded with the demonic witch Wang Xiaorong,” he added maliciously. “Their alliance threatens our sect’s purity.”

Xuanming’s face darkened. “This cannot stand. We await Guan Yu’s return for judgment.”

Qi bowed, hiding a smirk. But as the elders debated, none noticed Xiaotong’s fingers twitch—her consciousness returning to shatter his lies.
