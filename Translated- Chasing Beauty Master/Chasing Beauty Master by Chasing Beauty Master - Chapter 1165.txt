Lin Qiaoqiao nodded and replied, “The tannery in the eastern district reported a theft with evidence. After reviewing surveillance footage with my team, we identified and apprehended the suspects. Later, we discovered they’d hidden stolen goods in a southern district warehouse. Upon confirming this, I led a raid to seal the warehouse and brought all involved parties in for investigation. That’s the summary of events.”

“Among those arrested, is there a man named Sun Xu?” Director Gao inquired.

“Yes, Sun Xu was their ringleader. He controlled accomplices inside the tannery to steal goods and colluded with garbage truck drivers for large-scale thefts. We’ve confiscated approximately six tons of stolen materials,” Lin Qiaoqiao reported truthfully.

Director Gao hesitated, his brow furrowing at the mention of six tons. This was far more serious than Deputy Director Yan had implied—enough for heavy sentencing. The political tightrope walk became apparent. Though conflicted, having already accepted bribes, he pressed on: “Ahem, Captain Lin… Sun Xu happens to be a distant relative. Could you… extend some professional courtesy?”

He abandoned plans for a bureaucratic lecture. Lin Qiaoqiao’s reputation for impartiality demanded directness. Any circumlocution might worsen matters.

“Your relative?” Lin Qiaoqiao arched an eyebrow. The ethical calculus weighed heavily—absolute neutrality in their line was mythical, but favors depended on the requester’s standing. Director Gao’s usual support complicated refusal. Yet she recognized this “family connection” as likely fabricated, perhaps covering bribery or hidden ties. Maintaining surface decorum, she avoided confrontation with her superior.

Internally, she contrasted this with Guanyu’s recent request to ensure harsh punishment for Sun Xu. The irony wasn’t lost—now her superior pleaded for leniency towards the same criminal.

“Director Gao, Sun Xu’s crimes are egregious. Standard procedures mandate at least a decade’s sentence. Moreover, he targeted my friend’s factory. That friend explicitly demanded severe punishment. Your request places me in an untenable position.”

Suspecting pretext, Director Gao probed, “Your friend’s factory? Which one? Who is this friend?”

“The eastern district tannery belongs to Guanyu,” Lin Qiaoqiao stated bluntly.

“Guanyu?!” Director Gao paled. The name carried weight—a figure rumored to have formidable backing. Deputy Yan’s “simple favor” had become a landmine. Desperate, he implored, “Captain Lin, could you intercede with Guanyu? For family’s sake…”

Lin Qiaoqiao sighed. “I’ll relay your request. But Guanyu’s decision is final. Should he refuse, Sun Xu faces maximum penalties.” She deliberately placed the call on speakerphone.

Guanyu’s voice crackled through: “Director Gao’s ‘relative’? Sun Xu’s parents died years ago—he has no family. The Feng Clan bought your influence. Sun Xu must be made an example.”

The exposed lie left Director Gao red-faced. Lin Qiaoqiao concluded, “Without Guanyu’s consent, Sun Xu gets the full sentence. You’re welcome to persuade him yourself.”

Alone, Director Gao agonized over the ill-gotten 50,000 yuan. Had he known Guanyu’s involvement, he’d never have touched it. Now, returning the bribe or facing consequences loomed.

Meanwhile, Guanyu directed Wang Hu to purge Sun Xu’s remaining lackeys from the tannery. “Prioritize non-technical staff. Infiltrate apprentices into critical roles—we’ll phase out his loyalists gradually.”

Wang Hu frowned at the list. “Several are skilled technicians. Immediate removal would cripple production.”

“Patience. Without Sun Xu’s leadership, their cohesion will fray. Focus on knowledge transfer first.”

Guanyu then consulted Attorney Fu from Huayu Group regarding Lai Huangsi’s fraudulent contract. “The agreement is legally binding but signed under false pretenses. Exposing Lai’s fabricated identity nullifies it,” the lawyer explained.

“Trace Lai’s real background. If we prove identity fraud, not only does the contract collapse, but criminal charges follow.”

Two days later, investigations revealed Lai Huangsi as a Feng Clan proxy. The rushed order aimed to create contractual breaches for massive penalties. Guanyu’s counterattack began.

At Feng Manor, Young Master Feng dismissed concerns: “Sun Xu’s spent. Leave him to rot.”

Bill Lin, ever the pragmatist, sighed. “We tried. Perhaps ease his prison conditions later.”

Their complacency shattered when Lai Huangsi called in panic: “Guanyu’s suing me! They know my identity’s fake!”

Young Master Feng stormed to Bill Lin. “Your ‘foolproof plan’ just imploded!”

Bill Lin slumped, muttering, “Heaven itself opposes me against Guanyu…” The once-arrogant schemer seemed broken, while Guanyu’s legal machinery ground forward—methodical, inexorable.
