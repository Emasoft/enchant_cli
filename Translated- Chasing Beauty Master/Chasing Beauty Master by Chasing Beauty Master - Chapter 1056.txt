Guan Yu took a bite of apple and said, "Rest assured, this is China, not Bill Lin's hometown. It's not easy for Bill Lin to make waves here. Besides, those who collude with him aren't decent people anyway. We'll deal with them together to avoid future troubles."

Guan Yu still vividly remembered the incident where both Shuangshuang got injured—Bill Lin's handiwork. He had sworn to eradicate the Bill and Feng families completely. When Ge Yinglai led people to cause trouble at Qiaoyuan District's entrance last time, Guan Yu had already devised a series of plans, waiting for the enemy to walk into the trap.

Guan Yu didn't know much about Ma Tong apart from his reputation. The man maintained good public relations primarily due to his extensive network, making many curry favor with him.

However, in Guan Yu's eyes, anyone associated with Bill Lin was an enemy. Even if it were the Jade Emperor himself, Guan Yu would show no mercy.

Tomorrow marked the official school opening. Many Yu Gang members still lay hospitalized. Though tutors had been arranged for those wanting to study, Guan Yu felt uneasy.

He initially considered transferring all Yu Gang members to the Yang family's private clinic, but the numbers overwhelmed its capacity. After contacting Hou Jinshun to investigate Ma Tong's casino affairs, Guan Yu realized confronting absolute power required strengthening his own forces while opponents gathered reinforcements.

At the Yu Gang stronghold, three hall masters convened with several incense masters and company commanders. With expanding territory requiring more management, Guan Yu ordered promotions of capable personnel.

"Wei Hongwei announced, "From today, you ten are Yu Gang's incense masters. Each commands twenty men. Recruitment depends on your capabilities."

A nervous incense master asked, "Hall Master Wei, is there a mission? The atmosphere feels tense."

"Correct. The boss has arranged today's operations." Wei Hongwei gestured as men carried in a heavy wooden crate. "Follow me. What happens next remains confidential."

Wei Hongwei led the group to a 70-square-meter storage room filled with miscellaneous items. Three men struggled with an enormous sealed crate. The clanging iron door heightened suspense as whispers filled the air.

"Silence!" Wei Hongwei commanded. "Wang Hu, open it."

Wang Hu's punch dislodged the machine-sealed lid. Prying it open revealed wood shavings concealing pistols and ammunition—a sight that sent shivers through the crowd.

"A heavens! So many guns! Where'd they come from?" an excited incense master exclaimed.

Wei Hongwei smiled. "The boss purchased these for your protection as core members. Handle them discreetly—firearms are banned here. Distribute them carefully."

As eager hands reached forward, Jia Bo stopped them. "Wait! I'll distribute them. No grabbing!"

Fifty firearms of various models—revolvers, automatics—awaited selection. Each member eventually chose their weapon, including the hall masters. Wei Hongwei selected a colossal Colt Anaconda revolver nicknamed "hand cannon," ignoring practicality for intimidation factor.

Chapter 2701: Human Nature

After arming themselves, the leaders assigned territories and shifts. "Keep communication lines open," Wang Hu reminded. "The boss may summon you anytime."

At dawn, Bill Lin and Fang Su arrived at Ma Tong's casino. The assistant fawned over Bill Lin while ignoring Fang Su—a slight noted by the latter.

Finding Ma Tong in his office mid-tryst, Bill Lin feigned understanding. "Human nature, we all have needs."

Ma Tong's half-dressed mistress in translucent wrap captivated Fang Su's gaze. "Should we return later?" he taunted, provoking Ma Tong's ire.

After the woman retreated, Bill Lin broached strategy. "Regarding last night's damage... Perhaps we should discuss countermeasures against Guan Yu?"

Ma Tong waved off financial concerns while Bill Lin pressed: "Today I brought Young Master Fang to plan our joint operation. United, we can crush that Yu Gang menace."
