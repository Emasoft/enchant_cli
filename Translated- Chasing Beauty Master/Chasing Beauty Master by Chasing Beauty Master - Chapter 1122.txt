When Elder Wu finished speaking, he nervously observed the other party's expression. Nine hundred thousand was no small sum for him. Though the treasure map had fetched an ideal price today, the proceeds only exceeded expectations by a mere hundred thousand. Yet the other side had effortlessly taken over forty million, filling Elder Wu with intense envy.

The room's temperature seemed to plummet abruptly. As Jinyu Lang released his internal energy, even Zhang De – a cultivator at the third-class Honored One realm, nearing breakthrough to the second class – found the pressure unbearable.

As for Elder Wu, a novice cultivator not even qualified as third-class Honored One, the discomfort proved excruciating.

“Spare me your drivel,” Jinyu Lang coldly snorted. “This money never belonged to us – it’s destined for our superiors. Not a single cent less will be tolerated. You’re aware Patriarch Yang detests defaulters.”

Drenched in cold sweat, Elder Wu trembled before this intimidating figure. “Understood, perfectly understood! How should I deliver the funds? Such an enormous sum can’t possibly be withdrawn from banks.”

“No withdrawal needed,” Jinyu Lang icily replied. “Hand over the check. I’ll transfer twenty million and ten thousand to your account directly.”

Cornered, Elder Wu had no recourse. Though terrified of being swindled, he feebly inquired, “When will you initiate the transfer? Here’s my account details.” He placed a bank card on the table.

Zhang De picked up the card. “Immediately.” He photographed the card and sent it to Guan Yu, currently negotiating with bank managers about the massive transfer.

Guan Yu’s approach proved shrewd – with Jinyu Lang monitoring Elder Wu, they opted to transfer funds first to expedite matters, confident their quarry couldn’t escape.

“We’re arranging the transfer now,” Zhang De announced. “A brief wait suffices.”

Elder Wu relaxed marginally, surprised by their upfront payment. “Before transferring,” he hesitantly added, “I’ve another request.”

“Speak,” Zhang De prompted, activating voice chat so Guan Yu could monitor.

“Though I’ve sold the treasure map today, many still covet it. If you could announce its sale through your channels, it might spare me future troubles.”

Zhang De glanced at Jinyu Lang, who remained indifferent. The request seemed simple – a matter of spreading news through Guan Yu’s network. Yet Jinyu Lang focused on his impending share.

Seizing the moment before funds transferred, Elder Wu offered, “Keep ten thousand from the transfer as drinking money if you’ll circulate the news.”

Jinyu Lang’s demeanor shifted instantly. “Done. The entire city will know Bill Lynn purchased the map.”

Guan Yu chuckled upon receiving this update – easy profit for minimal effort. He transferred twenty million, prompting Elder Wu’s relieved laughter. “Full amount received! Such efficient dealings!”

“Enough celebration,” Jinyu Lang snapped. “The check.”

With trembling hands, Elder Wu retrieved a sixty-six million check from his safe. The sum’s loss felt physically painful, but escape proved impossible against these experts. Survival outweighed greed.

At Hua Ye Club, Guan Yu awaited his cut. When Jinyu Lang arrived, Zhang De returned the borrowed phone. “Keep it,” Guan Yu dismissed, handing Zhang De a cash-stuffed envelope.

After Zhang De’s departure, Jinyu Lang pressed, “My share? That check’s sixty-six million!”

“You’ve still got last month’s million,” Guan Yu deflected. “A-Mei noticed missing funds. I covered for you – told them I loaned it.”

Jinyu Lang scowled, recognizing Guan Yu’s manipulation through Xiying’s oversight. “At least tip me something from today’s haul!”

Their verbal sparring continued, Guan Yu expertly navigating between generosity and control, while across town, Bill Lynn stewed over his costly purchase. Unbeknownst to him, his treasure map fragments revealed nothing – requiring eight more pieces to decipher.

As Guan Yu celebrated his windfall, Bill Lynn ordered investigations into Zhang De while hiding his map fragments inside a disassembled laptop. The game of shadows and gold continued, each player convinced of their cunning while destiny shuffled its deck.
