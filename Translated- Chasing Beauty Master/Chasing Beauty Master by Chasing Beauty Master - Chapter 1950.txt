“This is truly vexing,” Guan Yu thought to himself, his brow furrowed. “I never expected the Demon Lord to follow so swiftly, accompanied by his Left and Right Envoys, along with several elders from the Demon Soul Sect. Those old foxes rarely involve themselves in worldly affairs—their presence here bodes ill. Have I toiled to find the Eastern Sea only to pave the way for others?”

Alone against the Demon Soul Sect’s elite, Guan Yu knew victory was impossible.

“How cunning you are, Demon Lord!” Guan Yu spat through clenched teeth. “While I’ve blazed the trail, you’ve trailed in my wake, reaping the rewards without lifting a finger. Now the Eastern Sea lies within your grasp.”

Frustration gnawed at him. He had hoped to share the Eastern Sea’s treasures—and the final volume of the Eight-Sided Drum technique—with Jiang Yuankai and Duan Ruxue. But the Demon Soul Sect’s arrival shattered that dream. Worse, rival factions would soon descend like vultures.

The Demon Lord spread his hands innocently. “Blame your stubbornness, not my cunning. I instructed Xiaorong to return, yet she defied me. What choice had I but to follow and ensure her safety?”

Guan Yu scoffed, refusing further debate. Words were useless now.

“Surrender the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl,” the Demon Lord proposed, “and we shall share the treasure as allies.”

The Right Envoy added smoothly, “The Demon Lord tacitly approves your bond with the Young Mistress. All the Sect’s resources might as well be yours. Cooperation benefits us all.”

Guan Yu’s laugh was icy. “Allies? I answer to no faction. What I claim through my own strength, I keep.”

Wang Xiaorong stood torn between them, knowing persuasion would fail.

“Your strength?” The Demon Lord chuckled. “Allow me to offer... persuasion.” He clapped sharply.

Three figures were shoved forward—Qiqi, Jiang Yuankai, and Duan Ruxue, bound and gagged. Guan Yu’s composure shattered.

“Release them!” he roared. “Harm one hair on Qiqi’s head, and I’ll drag you to hell myself!”

Wang Xiaorong paled. “Father, this madness helps none! Release them now!”

“Would you choose this outsider over your own blood?” the Demon Lord thundered.

Tears streamed down Wang Xiaorong’s face as she pressed a loaded crossbow to her throat. “Free them, or I die here!”

“Stop!” The Demon Lord’s resolve crumbled. With a reluctant wave, his disciples cut the prisoners’ bonds.

As Qiqi rushed to Guan Yu’s side, Jiang Yuankai muttered bitterly, “My presence here has become a burden.”

“The Dragon Pearl belongs to you,” Guan Yu said, offering the glowing orb.

Jiang Yuorkai declined. “Keep it. In my weakened state, it’s safer with you.”

Before Guan Yu could inquire about their capture, new voices echoed through the cavern.

“What a troublesome locale to locate,” sneared Sun Lianzi of the Red Lotus Sect, flanked by elders and disciples. Her gaze locked onto the Dragon Pearl. “Guan Yu—consorting with demonic filth? Today, I’ll cleanse Yunqing Sect’s shame!”

Two disciples lunged. Guan Yu’s crossbow snapped up—a bolt pierced Yue Jing’s shoulder, sending him crashing.

“Vile cur!” Lai Lixia screeched. “Using underhanded tricks!”

“For vermin like you?” Guan Yu retorted. “No honor is required.”

As tensions escalated, a familiar voice boomed: “My disciple requires no correction from outsiders!”

Grandmaster Xuanming descended with Yunqing Sect’s leadership, the fabled Qianlong Sword gleaming in an attendant’s arms. Three factions now stood poised like drawn blades—the Eastern Sea’s secrets hanging in the balance.
