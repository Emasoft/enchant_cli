“What are these ‘Punishment Officer’ and ‘Instructor’ you mentioned? What do they do? Do thief dens even have official ranks now?” Jin Hua asked curiously after hearing Ah Cai’s explanation.

Ah Cai elaborated, “Those are just titles. The people there stick to their roles. The Punishment Officer deals with disobedience or those who return empty-handed. The Instructor ‘educates’ the newly kidnapped or purchased victims.

The Instructors are terrifying. They silence newcomers through fear. Boys who displease them get beaten within an inch of their lives. Girls face…other methods.”

The idea of specialized roles within a trafficking den surprised them. Guan Yu mused that such operations likely colluded with authorities, making eradication complicated. “Do you know their exact location?” Jin Hua pressed.

Before Ah Cai could answer, Guan Yu interjected, “He wouldn’t. He can’t even confirm if the den is nearby.”

Ah Cai nodded. “Today was my first time leaving. The place is perpetually dark and damp. Only the higher-ups come and go freely. When I was brought out, my head was covered, and the ride felt endless.”

Jin Hua sighed in frustration. “How do we find it? No leads, and taking down a fortified den with so many people sounds impossible.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Simple. Ah Cai may not know, but the ones tailing us do. We’ll just ask them later.”

“Brother, if there’s any way I can help, don’t hesitate,” Ah Cai said solemnly, his demeanor radiating resolve.

Guan Yu nodded approvingly. “We’ll need your help when the time comes. For now, wait.”

As they chatted, Leili emerged humming. “Lunch is ready, everyone!”

Jin Hua sprang from Guan Yu’s arms and darted to the kitchen. “Coming!” Guan Yu called, following.

Leili’s modest dining area adjoined the kitchen, the table crowded with Western fare: fries, shrimp chips, steak, burgers, and red wine.

“Try my signature peppercorn steak—a one-of-a-kind recipe!” Leili urged proudly.

Jin Hua’s eyes sparkled as she eyed the steak. “Looks amazing!”

Guan Yu remarked, “Seven doneness—perfectly tender. A masterpiece.” Though accustomed to steak in China, Leili’s version surpassed even Mei’s black pepper variant.

Ah Cai, however, stared at his plate in disbelief. Having only ever smelled steak, he hesitated until Jin Hua noticed. “Don’t you like it?”

Stammering, Ah Cai shook his head. Guan Yu understood—overwhelmed by sudden kindness, he struggled to accept this luxury.

After devouring half her steak, Jin Hua nibbled fries. “Women have two stomachs: one for meals, one for snacks,” she teased Guan Yu.

Leili’s lingering glances didn’t escape him, but he avoided encouraging her. Moments later, Leili’s sister Laila entered.

“Meet my friends!” Leili introduced. “This is Guan Yu, Jin Hua, and Ah Cai. Sister, they’re visiting from China.”

Laila, shorter and sharper-eyed than Leili, greeted them in fluent Mandarin. “I learned from my ex-boyfriend,” she explained tersely.

As conversation flowed, Laila’s guardedness contrasted with Leili’s warmth. Noticing Ah Cai’s presence, she asked, “Are you three traveling together?”

“Ah Cai’s our translator,” Guan Yu deflected.

After the meal, Guan Yu signaled departure. Leili begged them to stay, but Laila’s coldness made excuses necessary.

“Keep in touch!” Leili insisted, saving her number in Guan Yu’s phone.

Once outside, Ah Cai broke the silence. “Laila lied.”

Guan Yu nodded. “I sensed it too. She wanted us gone.”

Jin Hua, half-asleep, perked up. “Who lied?”

“Laila,” Ah Cai said. “Her story didn’t add up.”

Guan Yu agreed. “Her hostility was clear. Best we left.”

As they drove, Jin Hua teased, “Leili likes you, doesn’t she?”

“Focus,” Guan Yu chided. “Why would Laila deceive us?”

The question hung, unanswered, as the car vanished into the dusk.

After farewells, Guan Yu’s group departed. Leili’s disappointment clashed with Laila’s curt “Visit again sometime.”

In the car, Ah Cai reiterated, “Laila’s lies matter. She’s hiding something.”

Guan Yu gripped the wheel. “We’ll find out soon enough.”

Jin Hua yawned. “But Leili was sweet. Shame her sister’s so…cold.”

“Not everything’s as it seems,” Guan Yu murmured, eyes on the road. The mystery of Laila’s deception lingered, a shadow trailing their retreating car.
