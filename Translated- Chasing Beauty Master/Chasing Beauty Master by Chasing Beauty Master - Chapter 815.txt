Guan Yu pondered this and agreed the matter was indeed challenging. He then recounted Qing Ling'er's poisoning incident to Hou Jinshun.

After hearing the details, Hou Jinshun speculated Ling'er must know her father's whereabouts. "Her father dotes on Ling'er and her mother dearly. Whether alive or dead, he would've informed them of his destination in the forest before departing," he reasoned.

Guan Yu found this plausible. "So you're saying Ling'er lied to me? She knows her father's location but remains silent, fearing that ghostly junior sister would harm him?"

Hou Jinshun countered, "In my view, that junior sister poses no real threat to Qing Guanghui. Her forceful demands for a meeting stem from lovesick anguish—she still harbors affection for him."

Even so, Qing Ling'er wouldn't trust such reasoning. To protect her father, she'd never reveal his whereabouts to anyone, including Guan Yu.

As Guan Yu conversed with Hou Jinshun, murmurs rippled through the hall's patrons. Glancing up, Guan Yu saw Yang Conghan descending the staircase.

Her ethereal beauty remained undiminished. Clad in a flowing sky-blue gauze dress that danced around her like a celestial being, her delicate feet—works of art in their own right—were adorned with white embroidered slippers.

Though sparse, the audience erupted in applause. Yang Conghan's transcendent charm held them spellbound.

Approaching Guan Yu, she greeted courteously, "It's been a while, Guan Yu."

**Chapter 2067: Deliberate**

"Indeed," Guan Yu replied, sensing newfound distance between them, perhaps due to his recent closeness with Jinhua. "How have you been lately?"

"Passably well," Yang Conghan answered, her tone laced with unspoken reproach. "Grandfather and I play chess to pass the time. Though occasionally... the days grow tedious." Her implication hung clear: as his acknowledged woman, she resented his prolonged absence.

Recognizing her meaning, Guan Yu apologized, "My schedule's been hectic, but I'd planned to visit you after concluding matters here today. Fortunate we crossed paths."

Yang Conghan saw through his flimsy excuse yet chose indulgence over confrontation. Sensing his third-wheel status, Hou Jinshun excused himself. Once alone, Yang Conghan inquired, "How fares Zhang Han? Grandfather wishes to have her return home soon."

"Take her back?" Guan Yu's mind raced. The Yangs' motive was transparent—they sought to probe the seal within Zhang Han. He resolved to prevent this.

"Hanhan thrives at my residence," he deflected. "She's engrossed in online games with Jingjing. Let her enjoy this respite a while longer."

Before Yang Conghan could protest, Guan Yu pressed, "Moreover, constant relocation risks exposing her to kidnappers. Best she remains stationary."

A server arrived with sizzling steak, momentarily halting their verbal spar. Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu inquired casually, "I heard Patriarch Yang wounded Jinhua recently. What transpired?"

Yang Conghan stiffened. "Few know of this. How did you—"

"My influence spans widely," Guan Yu interjected with practiced nonchalance. "Strange this should surprise you."

Relenting, Yang Conghan explained, "Father stationed guards near my villa. When Jinhua returned, he ambushed her. Though she escaped, Father's poisoned blade ensures she won't survive without aid."

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. "Poisoned? Wouldn't such methods tarnish Yang prestige?"

"The Yangs prioritize results over appearances," she deflected. "Without expert detoxification, Jinhua's fate is sealed."

"Why risk returning?" Guan Yu probed, testing her honesty.

"Father claims she entered through rear windows. Her purpose remains unknown."

"Patriarch Yang should've allowed her to retrieve her objective first," Guan Yu mused pointedly.

"Subsequent searches revealed nothing," Yang Conghan admitted.

*Of course not,* Guan Yu thought. *The prize lies within your bedchamber—off-limits to searchers.* Seizing the moment, he proposed, "Let us investigate your villa now."

**Chapter 2068: Supreme Reward**

Yang Conghan's villa stood pristine as ever. In her sanctuary—where none but Guan Yu had trespassed—he feigned fatigue, collapsing onto her goose-down mattress. "Suddenly exhausted," he declared with suggestive eyebrow lift.

Blushing furiously, Yang Conghan demurred, "But daylight persists... what if—"

"Unwilling?" Guan Yu boomed, relishing her flustered squirm.

"N-no! Just... allow me a moment..." Her coy demeanor captivated him anew.

Post-coital twilight found Guan Yu alone in the dimmed chamber. Remembering Jinhua's commission, he combed the bed's undercarriage. Beneath reversed carpet fibers near the wall, a hidden compartment yielded a weathered deerskin journal—the Demon Clan's Notebook.

"Guan Yu! Dinner!" Yang Conghan's call interrupted. Concealing his prize, he descended to find her transformed—domestic goddess replacing ice queen. Her flushed contentment amused him; women thrived on disciplined attention.

After wolfing two helpings, Guan Yu excused himself abruptly. "Urgent matters. I'll return soon."

Yang Conghan's disappointment melted into compliance. "Attend your duties," she acquiesced, though longing lingered.

At Jinhua's hideout, Qing Ling'er administered final treatments. "Her wounds are 90% healed," she announced.

Presenting the journal, Guan Yu teased, "Does gratitude end at words?"

Jinhua peeked at Ling'er, whispering, "Stay tonight... as reward."

Ling'er tactfully exited, cheeks aflame. Guan Yu's triumphant grin spread—tonight promised inventive delights.

**Chapter 2069: Whimsical Moods**

Jinhua understood male psychology intimately. By rationing intimacy, she sustained Guan Yu's obsession—a necessity amidst his burgeoning harem. Tonight's concession, despite residual injury, secured her advantage.

Meanwhile, Qing Ling'er wrestled conflicted emotions. Guan Yu's roguish charm differed from typical playboys—his integrity shone through decadence. Yet she hesitated, uncertain of her place in his constellation.

"Stay with us tonight," Guan Yu entreated Ling'er, plotting morning logistics.

Her blush mirrored Jinhua's earlier discomfiture. In this den of clandestine passions, three souls navigated love's labyrinth—each step calculated, every heartbeat a gambit in the grand romance.
