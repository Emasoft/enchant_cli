“With prolonged peace, both our sect and the Demon Sect have developed issues. Since war has broken out, it won’t cease easily. Certain matters must indeed be thoroughly investigated.” Zuo Qingyi’s murderous aura surged unabated. This incident, fraught with repeated setbacks, left her deeply aggrieved.

“We were far too complacent in this worldly conflict. Our sect has remained secluded too long, lagging behind the Demon Sect in adaptability—whether in intelligence gathering or combat methods. We’ve fallen significantly behind and must reform thoroughly. Otherwise, further losses await.” Zhang Ziran’s expression turned grave. Though outwardly carefree, he harbored deep pride. The recent crushing defeat at the hands of Qingtian not only shook his confidence but jolted him into sober clarity.

The sudden emergence of twelve Golden Core-level experts from the Demon Sect had even made Zhang Ziran scent death. Had Guan Yu not deployed his grand formation, none would have survived. The helplessness of life and death hanging by a thread left Zhang Ziran profoundly unsettled. He resolved to return to his sect, scrutinize this campaign, and prepare for the next great battle.

**Chapter 1189: The Ancient Demon Sect Emerges**

Expecting sect reinforcements, Guan Yu and his comrades instead received orders to retreat.

And retreat they did—so thoroughly that not a trace remained.

“Master, why have we withdrawn? Is the war over?” Upon returning to White Cloud Temple, Guan Yu immediately sought Master Yehe, voicing his confusion.

“Oh? Tell me—why must we continue fighting?” Master Yehe regarded his youngest disciple with amusement. An exemplary heir in all aspects, Guan Yu’s straightforward nature merely needed tempering to fully inherit the mantle of leadership.

“Why stop? We haven’t lost.” Guan Yu pondered, realizing no clear rationale for prolonging the conflict. For him, prolonged warfare meant seizing Demon Sect resources. The six slain demonic cultivators’ Golden Cores and bodies had already been fed to the Demon Subduing Sect’s mountain gate, exchanged for a martial manual, ten days of training hall access, and two low-grade spirit stones.

“True, we haven’t lost—but neither have we won. Yet this battle exposed critical flaws. Better to uncover them now than later. Left unaddressed, we’d perish without knowing why when the Demon Sect strikes again.” Master Yehe smiled faintly, visibly pleased.

“A respite allows us to regroup, refine martial arts, and develop new techniques. Master, I wish to take you somewhere.” Guan Yu exhaled deeply. The Demon Subduing Sect’s secrets couldn’t remain hidden forever. Moreover, after bargaining with Kunlun to save Ye Qingfeng, a deluge of Five Elements essences would soon arrive. Their destination required explanation.

“Hah… Such dense spiritual energy! This must be the mountain gate of the sect you inherited. Marvellous—to contain a realm within a mustard seed! Such mastery of spatial arts defies comprehension. Truly worthy of an ancient immortal!” Every newcomer to the Demon Subduing Sect’s sanctum voiced similar awe.

“Master Guan Yu, your teacher… his lifespan dwindles.” Jingang’s words struck like thunder, freezing Guan Yu in place.

“Explain! What’s wrong? Can it be cured?” Recovering, Guan Yu pressed urgently. Jingang never spoke idly—if mentioned, hope remained.

“His Dao Foundation is damaged, but not irreparable. Our sect possesses the Condensed Truth Pill, a superior elixir for this. Ingredients exist here save one—the Crimson Flame Blood Mushroom. It grows only in Demon Sect territories. You must seek ruins of the ancient Demon Sect.” As Jingang’s voice faded, Guan Yu noticed Master Yehe’s altered gaze.

“Heh. Even my flawed Dao Foundation escapes not the artifact spirit’s notice. Remarkable. Yu’er, is there a remedy?” Master Yehe asked lightly, expectations muted.

“Yes, but one ingredient is needed. Master, how long until your heavenly tribulation?” Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated his master’s equanimity, which only strengthened his resolve.

“Five years. An incomplete Dao Foundation matters little. Did it hinder my ascent thus far? It’s inconsequential.” Master Yehe’s tone remained breezy, yet his bearing exuded peerless confidence—befitting the world’s foremost expert.

“Rest assured, Master. Within five years, I’ll deliver the Condensed Truth Pill.” Guan Yu smiled. He’d chosen his teacher well.

**Training Hall**

Three months of seclusion in the Training Hall, yet the new Dragon Subduing Palm still lacked that final spark of perfection.

*Roar—!*

Guan Yu practiced tirelessly. As his true essence coalesced, a golden dragon writhed around his palm. Dragons command clouds, tigers the wind. Suddenly, mist swirled, condensing into lifelike draconic forms. Inspiration struck.

“Dragon and Tiger in harmony! So that’s the key. Wind precedes clouds—these two martial arts can fuse!” His left hand conjured a white tiger. Dragon and tiger resonated, their cries reverberating as terrifying magnetic forces gathered—uncontrolled yet formidable.

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes, activating the gravity array. Instantly, crushing weight nearly flattened him.

Relaxing, he summoned a simulated foe—a late Golden Core demonic cultivator. Gravity surged. Dragon and tiger struck. The enemy disintegrated before Guan Yu could blink.

“A fivefold amplification! This Dragon-Tiger Subduing Fist rivals Nascent Soul techniques. If only I had a live test subject…” Exiting the hall, Guan Yu thirsted for battle. With such power, no adversary seemed insurmountable.

The amplification affected both gravity and the synergy between dragon and tiger techniques. Combined, they birthed a divine ability—Dragon’s Roar, Tiger’s Howl. Three simulated late Golden Core demons fell instantly. Though left weakened for a minute afterward, the trade-off was priceless.

“Jingang, is this a divine ability—the pinnacle of Nascent Soul or higher arts? Astonishing. If the Tiger Subduing Fist extends thus, why not the Seven Stars Swordplay? And Jingang—how long must I suppress my cultivation?” Power bred craving. Mastery’s intoxication surpassed even addiction.

**Chapter 1190: Three Years in a Blink**

Finally, time to reflect—to consolidate experiences and chart his path forward.

His time in the cultivation world, though brief, had transformed Guan Yu’s character and methods. He felt cleaved into two selves.

White Cloud Temple’s remote location spared it modernity’s encroachment. During respites, Guan Yu often wandered mortal realms—bars, teahouses, parks, riversides—now estranged from once-familiar haunts. Detachment’s chill gnawed.

“What brings you here unannounced? Trouble?” Strolling his favorite riverside path with Zhang Ziran, Guan Yu radiated ease. The earlier sense of alienation had dissolved—he now flowed like water returning to the sea.

“Three years apart, yet you’ve progressed again. Monstrous. Yes, I need your aid.” Zhang Ziran eyed Guan Yu—a dormant volcano masked by calm. Three years had rewritten much.

“My help? The mighty Dragon Tiger Mountain seeks a mere Golden Core cultivator? Beware—my price is steep.” Guan Yu smirked. Three years’ seclusion (or more, within the sect’s time-warped sanctum) had reshaped his psyche.

“Enough games. This matter requires you specifically. Refusal carries… consequences.” Having immersed in mortal society, Zhang Ziran shed past naivety.

“Your sect’s influence, bolstered by national backing through the Dragon Group, dominates all domains. What challenge remains? The Demon Sect?” Guan Yu’s jest faltered at Zhang Ziran’s troubled frown.

“The Demon Sect lies low since that battle, stirring only abroad. As spiritual energy resurges globally, minor cultivation ruins emerge. Though yields are modest, sects gain precious materials—ancient forging, alchemy, and array techniques now within reach. A new ruin surfaces—a Zhang family ancestor’s tomb. We’d have you join the expedition.” Zhang Ziran’s discomfort didn’t obscure the request.

“Traps? Arrays? Out with it—where’s the site? Three years apart, yet you hesitate?” Guan Yu chuckled. His cultivation display had unwittingly distanced his friend.

“Arrays, you brat! Thought you’d gone cold. Spar sometime? Or have you outgrown old comrades?” Three years had reshaped Zhang Ziran profoundly.

Not fear, but unfamiliarity bridged their silence.

“You’re my first visitor after three ascetic years! How could I not tease? Now—catch me up. I’ve starved for news.” Guan Yu’s renewed levity masked inner transformation.

Feigning youth came easily at twenty; harder for one decades older. Time’s passage chilled—yet Golden Core cultivation halted aging. Reacclimating to mortality would take adjustment.

Under White Cloud Temple and the Righteous Alliance’s support, Guan Yu’s mortal assets now sprawled obscenely. Though state monopolies dominated key sectors, his empire thrived through domestic and foreign holdings. Profit no longer drove him—Kunlun’s “generous” Five Elements essences (millennia-old wood, ice, meteoric iron, spirit-fire seeds, enchanted soil) had enlightened him.

Though Jingang scorned these, Guan Yu gained extended training time, a Golden Core sword art, and the Nascent Soul chapter of the Great Demon Subduing Scripture. Three years advanced him to mid-Golden Core, solidified his foundation, and fused his异能 with cultivation into seamless combat styles. Now, the Crimson Flame Blood Mushroom called—Master Yehe’s Dao Foundation demanded it.

Yet tasks multiplied: Qingtian’s three-year duel loomed. Anticipation thrummed.

**Chapter 1191: Qingtian Appears**

“Ah, the capital! Long absent, many must’ve forgotten me. Well—Guan Yu has returned!” Exiting the airport, he basked in the city’s familiar-unfamiliar aura. Once overwhelming, it now stirred no awe.

“Enough preening. Why hasn’t Lin Dong met us?” Dongfang Huoyu kicked Guan Yu playfully. Three years (or more in the sect’s time) hadn’t dulled her youthful charm.

“Ah—an old friend arrives. Go ahead; I’ll greet him.” Pretending injury, Guan Yu froze—a familiar aura prickled his senses.

“Qingtian—bullying my subordinate amuses you?” Materializing before the Demon Lord, Guan Yu’s smile chilled. A flick of his finger roused the groaning Lin Dong.

“Three years unchanged—still humorless. Time’s up. Ready to die?” Qingtian’s casual tone belied his lethal intent. Murder seemed mundane as breathing.

“I’m always prepared. But my killer won’t be you. Here to settle things now?” Guan Yu sneered. Both knew combat here was impossible.

“Of course not. Foolishness isn’t my vice. You’re here for the Zhang family tomb, no?” Qingtian’s eyes gleamed. He’d feared missing their duel—Nascent Soul beckoned, and his time in the mortal realm dwindled.

The leap from Golden Core to Nascent Soul bridged heaven itself. Post-breakthrough, lifespan’s expansion demanded broader cultivation—paths diverging from petty duels.

“Well-informed. You seek it too?” Guan Yu kept his face blank, though shocked. The Zhangs wouldn’t publicize their ancestor’s tomb—how had the Demon Sect learned?
