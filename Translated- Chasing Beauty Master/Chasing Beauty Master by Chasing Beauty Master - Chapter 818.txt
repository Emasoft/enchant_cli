“A single chance—an opportunity to meet the Feng family’s eldest daughter, Feng Xihu (West Lake), for a blind date—to dine with a woman hailed as a legendary fairy maiden—was the pinnacle of these men’s aspirations.

Some even shouldered sacks of rice or flour to attend the matchmaking. By the end, the line of suitors stretched from the Feng estate’s gates all the way down the street.

Feng Xihu finally snapped. She stormed into her brother’s room, smashing and hurling objects. When Young Master Feng returned, his face turned ashen.

The women’s intimate garments adorning his walls—treasured collectibles, some even limited editions—now lay trampled under Feng Xihu’s feet. The sight nearly made him faint.

“‘Brother, are you taking me for a fool?’” Feng Xihu raged, her cheeks flushed with fury. “‘What sort of people are these? Can they truly aid the Feng family’s cause? Strengthen our influence? This is a blatant mockery! I’ll have none but Guan Yu!’”

She had unraveled her brother’s scheme. Cornered and guilt-ridden by his excess, Young Master Feng could only apologize. After Feng Xihu rampaged through the eastern pavilion, she stormed off.

He surveyed the wreckage of his room, utterly speechless.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s days were no easier. With his companions engrossed in gaming, he often sought solace with Jinhua.

He soon uncovered a truth: Cao Jin’s disruption at Kaihuang Academy had been orchestrated by Wang Ting. This revelation shattered Guan Yu’s regard for Wang Jun.

At the school cafeteria, Guan Yu thoroughly humiliated Li Yuan. As Li was helped away, he vowed retaliation through Ma Hai.

Guan Yu grew impatient tracking Cao Jin, who owed unpaid compensation for blockading the school gates. Rumors claimed Cao had sought Ma Hai’s protection, hiding under his arrangement.

Having recently returned, Ma Hai seethed at Guan Yu’s repeated humiliations of his men. He resolved to confront Guan Yu personally.

In Mike’s Bar, Guan Yu and Ma Hai faced off five meters apart. Ma Hai’s bulk shoved aside the beauty in his arms.

Guan Yu knew Ma Hai’s cultivation had reached the peak of Second-Class Adept, backed by shadowy forces. Though unclear who supported him, Guan Yu had ample justification to act.

“‘Ma Hai,’” Guan Yu declared, “‘you’ve crossed me repeatedly. But targeting Ling’er? Unforgivable.’”

Days prior, thugs nearly abducted Ling’er after work. Only Pan Taisheng’s timely intervention saved her.

“‘Just a girl,’” Ma Hai sneered. “‘Why shouldn’t I play with her? Who are you to stop me? In my eyes, you’re but an ant I can crush anytime.’”

His arrogance matched his profound cultivation. Guan Yu realized direct combat might prove fatal—Ma Hai’s experience outweighed even First-Class Adepts.

But Guan Yu wasn’t foolhardy. With a snap of his fingers, Jones entered—a beauty specially summoned. Her frost-altered physique from Arctic ice caves granted extraordinary cultivation speed.

Now matching Ma Hai’s level, Jones’ partnership tipped the scales. Seeing her, Ma Hai’s eyes lit up before dimming in realization.

“‘Using a woman?’” Ma Hai taunted. “‘Such cowardice! Pity to damage such beauty.’” Bluster aside, he knew the odds.

Guan Yu smirked, arm encircling Jones’ waist. “‘My partner stays. Unlike you—attacking women from shadows. What dignity?’”

As negotiations failed, Guan Yu and Jones attacked in seamless tandem—Guan high, Jones low. Ma Hai barely parried, confirming Guan Yu’s suspicions about his resilience.

In a critical moment, Jones spun low with a sweeping kick, forcing Ma Hai airborne. His bulk belied agility as he teleported three meters back—into a corner.

Guan Yu pressed with hand-chops concealing Yang Cong’s dagger. Dodging left, Ma Hai met Jones’ ice needle—a condensed frigid qi that pierced his shoulder.

The needle exploded internally. Within breaths, Ma Hai froze solid before shattering into icy gore.

Guan Yu stared, stunned by Jones’ lethal innovation. She explained: Ma Hai had clutched a ninja smoke bomb—reason for her decisive strike.

Later, soaring over a crocodile-infested marsh, Guan Yu and Jinhua neared exhaustion. Landing on a massive tree, they watched crocodiles stack into living ladders below.

As reptiles climbed perilously close, a sudden strike came from above—a five-meter cobra! Shoving Jinhua aside, Guan Yu fell toward snapping jaws below.

Activating his shield mid-air, he yelled: “‘Jinhua! Above you!’” The thwarted cobra struck again as crocodiles thrashed beneath, awaiting their plummeting meal.
