“Second to Wolf shook his head. ‘That’s precisely what I wanted to say. Yingshan Gu is gone, and those two treasure maps are wasted. One had already been sold at the auction house, but she hadn’t had time to collect the payment. The other has vanished without a trace.’

‘Let it go. It’s no great loss. At least we’ve eliminated a potential threat, which is a major victory. You’ve worked hard these days, Brother Second,’ Guan Yu said. After all, those treasure maps were fakes—losing them meant nothing.

Second to Wolf tilted his head, eyeing Guan Yu with bafflement. ‘Did I hear correctly? You actually thanked me? How... unexpected.’

‘Why wouldn’t I? You’ve been running errands for me all this time, traveling so far and not changing clothes for over half a month. You clearly deserve some acknowledgment,’ Guan Yu replied with a grin.

Second to Wolf gulped down a mouthful of wine. ‘Since you’re being so gracious, I’ll share another piece of news. Though you might already know.’

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred**

Guan Yu leaned in curiously. ‘What news? Let’s hear it.’

‘The Feng family is gathering a group—mercenaries recruited by the Venomous Widow. Around a hundred men, all from prominent martial sects. Rumor says they’re formidable, likely from some mountain stronghold. Beyond that, I know little.’

‘Where did you hear this?’ Guan Yu pressed.

‘On my way back today, I saw the Feng family preparing horses—each mounted by a rider. At least fifty or sixty steeds. I didn’t track their destination, but I inquired along the road.’

Guan Yu nodded. ‘Trouble brews again. When will we ever have peace?’

Second to Wolf warned, ‘Stay vigilant, Guan Yu. Bill Lin’s allies are no ordinary foes. Prepare yourself.’

Guan Yu shrugged. ‘With you here, what have I to fear?’ His flattery, genuine or not, pleased Second to Wolf immensely.

The latter tore into a hunk of meat, laughing heartily. ‘Of course! With me around, no scheme can withstand raw power. Hah!’

Though the two men appeared nonchalant, Xue Jing’s mind churned with anxiety over looming threats.

She interjected, ‘Brother Second, you saw these men firsthand. Did anything about them stand out?’

‘Yes! Elaborate, please,’ Guan Yu added.

Second to Wolf drained another beer. ‘Very well. On my return journey, I encountered a caravan straight out of antiquity—fifty or sixty men on horseback.’

‘Horseback? Such riders are rare these days,’ Guan Yu remarked.

‘Let me finish,’ Second to Wolf continued. ‘These weren’t city folk. Their attire and accents marked them as outsiders. Most intriguingly, they were all cultivators—each at the Second-Class Adept level.’

‘Impossible!’ Xue Jing exclaimed. ‘Fifty-six Second-Class Adepts? That’s terrifying! Sister Jones’ Free Faction has over three hundred members, yet so few reach that tier!’

Noting Guan Yu’s skepticism, Second to Wolf added, ‘I was equally stunned. I trailed them briefly, eavesdropping to learn more.’

He paused to devour more food, ignoring Guan Yu’s impatient glare. ‘Eat while you talk! Must you drag this out?’

‘Meat’s best hot,’ Second to Wolf retorted, sliding two skewers toward Xue Jing. She declined—she only ate home-cooked meals, deeming street fare unclean.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. ‘Can’t you talk and chew?’

‘Ruins the flavor,’ Second to Wolf mumbled through a greasy mouthful. ‘True enjoyment demands undivided attention.’

Xue Jing gently touched Guan Yu’s arm. ‘Let him eat. He seems starved.’

Second to Wolf nodded vigorously. ‘Exactly! Days without proper meals! Priorities first.’

Guan Yu relented, recognizing the man’s deliberate teasing. Provoking him further would yield nothing.

‘Delicious!’ Second to Wolf resumed between bites. ‘I shadowed them until they paused to rest. Their rear guards chatted—apparently, these riders are bandits from a mountain fortress, hired by the Venomous Widow to aid Bill Lin. The horses were too conspicuous, so they’re returning them. Feng family vehicles will ferry them back afterward.’

‘That’s all?’ Guan Yu pressed. ‘No hints of their plans?’

‘None. But they’ve likely just arrived. Schemes take time.’

Guan Yu frowned. ‘Their numbers and strength alarm me. Fifty-six Second-Class Adepts... Unthinkable.’

‘Bill Lin’s reach surprises even me,’ Second to Wolf admitted. ‘You’ll need strategies, not brute force.’

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and One: Hold Back a Little**

The revelation hung heavy. Xue Jing fell silent, daunted by the scale of the threat.

‘We must prepare,’ Guan Yu declared, eyeing Second to Wolf pointedly.

The latter feigned ignorance. ‘I’ve been busy hunting Yingshan Gu. My gambling itch needs scratching—no time for babysitting.’

Guan Yu turned to Xue Jing. ‘Perhaps Sakurako can advise us.’

Second to Wolf choked on his wine. ‘Using her against me? I could vanish, you know! Face those experts alone!’

‘Hiding won’t work,’ Guan Yu countered. ‘Bill Lin will provoke me through my allies. We must act.’

Xue Jing agreed. ‘Brother Second, these mercenaries are undoubtedly skilled. We need your help.’

Second to Wolf groaned. ‘Fine, but on one condition.’ He glared at Guan Yu. ‘The Fang family spoils—I want my share.’

Guan Yu sighed. ‘Yao Yu swindled most of it. The rest went to my faction leaders. Ask them.’

‘Unbelievable!’ Second to Wolf sputtered. ‘You seek my aid yet offer nothing?’

Xue Jing intervened. ‘Protect me, and you protect him by default. We’re rarely apart.’

Second to Wolf scowled. ‘Clever. But remember—I hold grudges.’

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Two: A Man Who Bears a Grudge**

Xue Jing smiled. ‘We’re family, Brother Second. Your prowess is too precious to waste.’

Relenting, Second to Wolf muttered, ‘Just... don’t make me regret this.’

As the trio strategized, the shadow of approaching conflict loomed ever darker, their fates intertwined in the storm ahead.”
