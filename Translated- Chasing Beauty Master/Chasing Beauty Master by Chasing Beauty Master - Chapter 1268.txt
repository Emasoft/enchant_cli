At this moment, Guan Yu realized that immortal cultivators didn't necessarily need guardians - having enough subordinates could temporarily block threats.

Guan Yu grew anxious. He couldn't seriously injure all these Zuokong Peak disciples before him, yet if he didn't disable them, they'd keep rising to block his path after being knocked down.

Suddenly, dazzling cold light erupted around Elder Xiang, startling disciples into pallid complexions. No one knew what spell the elder was preparing, but its intense energy fluctuations were unmistakable.

Sweat beaded on Guan Yu's brow. Elder Xiang's spell clearly possessed extraordinary power - anyone struck would likely be bedridden for months.

The situation left only one option: activate the Imperial Seal's stored magic to attack Elder Xiang first. Otherwise, the elder's completed spell would deal catastrophic damage.

Without hesitation, Guan Yu viciously kicked a Zuokong disciple in the face, sending the youth flying. His strikes grew sluggish without inner energy reinforcement.

The Imperial Seal in Guan Yu's left hand blazed with radiant light as he prepared to unleash one of Patriarch Jiu's stored spells. His heart ached - each precious charge had been painstakingly imbued by the venerable elder.

Every expended spell meant begging Patriarch Jiu for replenishment, no simple task. Even if willing, the elder couldn't constantly provide such energy-intensive high-level magics.

Elder Xiang anticipated this move. Seeing Guan Yu's activation gesture, he immediately deployed pre-prepared defensive wards. Though uncertain of the Imperial Seal's power, he trusted Patriarch Jiu's craftsmanship and summoned his strongest barrier.

A metallic screech pierced the air. Someone shouted, “Brother, please show mercy!” before a gale-force wind whipped past Elder Xiang. The elder's hairpin shattered, locks tumbling down as stinging pain bloomed across his face.

Dumbfounded, Elder Xiang stared at his fallen hair. His defensive spells had utterly failed.

Disciples initially thought Guan Yu had unleashed the Imperial Seal's power. But Guan Yu himself smiled faintly, the Seal's glow dimming as he aborted the attack.

Putting away the artifact, Guan Yu revealed the newcomer - Jie Cilang materializing beside the disheveled elder. Clumps of severed hair slid from Elder Xiang's shoulders where Jie Cilang's blade had passed.

Earlier, Jie Cilang and Elder Lu had been strolling nearby when they witnessed the confrontation. Seeing someone preparing magic against Guan Yu, Jie Cilang instantly unsheathed his dao and blurred into motion.

Elder Lu barely stopped the lethal strike with a shouted warning. Jie Cilang's redirected blade sheared hair instead of arteries - a hairsbreadth from decapitation.

“That was close!” Elder Lu gasped, rushing to check on his colleague. Elder Xiang stood petrified, fingers trembling as he patted himself for wounds.

“He's unharmed,” Jie Cilang scoffed, sheathing his weapon. “Merely frightened. Surprising such a coward dared challenge Guan Yu.”

Guan Yu smiled gratefully. “Perfect timing, Brother Jie. Saved me a precious charge.”

“So this is Yunqing Sect's famed hospitality?” Jie Cilang's voice carried across the courtyard. “That spell aimed to kill! We're leaving.”

Panic flashed through Elder Lu. Losing Guan Yu would devastate their sect. “A misunderstanding! Let's discuss this reasonably.”

Jie Cilang wheeled on him. “Misunderstanding? That was attempted murder! Were it not for your shout, I'd have removed his head!”

Elder Xiang finally found his voice, quavering, “D-do you know where you are? This is Tiger Head Peak! How dare an outsider-”

“Enough!” Elder Lu interjected. “Brother Jie acted to protect Guan Yu. Elder Xiang, explain yourself!”

The humiliated elder straightened. “This... this junior shows no respect! Injuring my disciples, slandering my name! Discipline was necessary!”

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Disciples exchanged knowing glances - the story didn't match witnessed events.

Guan Yu sighed. “Brother Jie, perhaps we should depart. Yunqing Sect harbors vermin beneath its noble reputation.”

As they turned to leave, Siqi rushed forward. “Wait! Let's consult Sect Master Xuanming first!”

Xiao Zhi and Aze joined the plea. “Senior Jie,” Xiao Zhi addressed the dao-wielder respectfully, “this matter deserves proper adjudication.”

Reluctantly, Jie Cilang agreed to stay pending Xuanming's judgment. Elder Xiang seethed silently, nursing both humiliation and fear of the supreme expert beside Guan Yu.

When Sect Master Xuanming arrived with other elders, Elder Xiang immediately accused: “This outsider assaulted me! Guan Yu injured my disciples!”

Jie Cilang's blade rasped partially from its sheath. “Lies. Your spell sought murder. My blade brings truth.”

Xuanming's gaze swept the scene - fallen disciples, severed hair, the Imperial Seal's residual energy. “All elders to the Hall of Clarity. We shall... discuss this thoroughly.”

The crisis momentarily paused, but tensions thrummed like a drawn bowstring. Guan Yu met Elder Xiang's glare calmly, Imperial Seal warm against his palm. Three charges remained.
