Here, Wang Jun and Guan Yu would always be of one mind. No matter what conflicts arose between the Cloud Azure Sect and the Demonic Soul Sect in the future, Guan Yu trusted that Wang Jun would never betray him.

Moreover, Guan Yu now sought opportunities to help Wang Jun eliminate his blood poison. However, this required waiting for the right moment. Perhaps after some time, when Guan Yu's capabilities grew stronger, he could resolve this matter completely.

Siqi already possessed a high-grade magical artifact—the Jade Ruyi. Though the ironstone held little practical use for her, Guan Yu still contemplated crafting a better hand crossbow for her when time permitted. After all, the materials Elder Wang's group used were ordinary, resulting in lackluster potency.

Xuanming descended and accepted the ironstone, muttering inwardly about Guan Yu's stinginess in bringing only a single piece. Not that he could blame the young man—dealing with someone like Sect Leader Xiang left little room for generosity. That Guan Yu didn't make an issue of it was already commendable.

“This matter is finally settled,” Xuanming said with a relieved smile. “I must thank you for your reasonableness. Had you caused more complications, resolving this would have been truly troublesome.”

Guan Yu sneered. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave. The next two days will be busy—Elder Wang’s first hand crossbow nears completion.”

“Though time-consuming, success justifies the effort,” Xuanming replied. “Do bring it for inspection once finished.”

“The prototype naturally takes longer,” Guan Yu explained. “Once perfected, production will accelerate. The main obstacle now is insufficient materials for mass crafting.”

“Leave material procurement to me,” Xuanming said. “Our priority remains reaching Miao City—a distant journey. By your return, Elder Wang’s techniques should mature.”

Seeing Xuanming’s confidence, Guan Yu simply nodded. How far Elder Wang could advance the crossbow designs remained uncertain.

Upon returning, Guan Yu found Wang Jun asleep at his workbench. The young inventor had labored sleeplessly for days, his crossbow nearly complete. Though few bolts were finished, their production could be expedited.

Three blazing furnaces dominated the workshop, melting metals for molding. Wang Jun’s unique bolts combined Mystic Steel tips with shafts of iron-gold alloy.

Gazing at his slumbering friend, Guan Yu chuckled wryly at the extravagant bolts. “Forget performance—the material cost alone is staggering.”

Wang Jun had exhausted his gold reserves to achieve optimal bolt weight for accuracy and penetration. His logic held merit—lighter projectiles risked deviation from wind resistance, while insufficient mass reduced stopping power.

Two days later, their second crossbow emerged—bulkier than Wang Xiaorong’s pistol-grip design, featuring an angled rifle-style handle. Though Guan Yu questioned the ergonomics, he admired Wang Jun’s inventiveness.

“Shall we test it?” Guan Yu suggested.

“Absolutely!” Wang Jun grabbed his creation, six specialized bolts in hand.

As they exited, Elder Wang approached proudly bearing his own larger crossbow. Guan Yu smiled. “Seems your team succeeded too.”

“Marvelous!” The elder exclaimed. “You youths outpace my entire workshop!”

Guan Yu demurred, “Your apprentices’ material preparation was invaluable, though it delayed your progress.”

Testing commenced in nearby woods. Elder Wang’s crossbow achieved thirty meters with respectable force, while Wang Jun’s heavier bolts maintained accuracy up to fifty meters but faltered at seventy—still lethal against human targets.

Guan Yu realized the white beast sinews they’d acquired were crucial for the weapons’ enhanced power. As Wang Jun basked in his achievement, Guan Yu proposed visiting their convalescing friend Xiao Zhi.

At Xuanyong Peak, Sect Leader Zheng personally greeted them. “Words fail to express my gratitude for saving my son’s life.”

After formalities, Guan Yu requested to examine Xiao Zhi. “We must verify complete blood poison removal. I advise borrowing the Spirit Beast Scale from the Sect Master for confirmation.”

Zheng nodded gravely. “A prudent measure. I’ll petition the Sect Master immediately—I don’t trust Sect Leader Xiang’s integrity either. He might have cut corners in the purification.”

As they proceeded to Xiao Zhi’s quarters, Guan Yu’s mind raced. Between crossbow innovations and political machinations, every success bred new challenges. Yet through it all, the unshakable bonds between these young cultivators promised hope against the gathering storms.
