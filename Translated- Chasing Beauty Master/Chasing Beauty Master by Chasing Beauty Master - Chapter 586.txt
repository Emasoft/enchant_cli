The rapidly spinning vortex gathered spiritual energy at an astonishing speed. Before long, Guan Yu felt his entire dantian brimming with this concentrated energy. With a resolute shout of "Condense!", the clockwise-rotating vortex abruptly reversed direction while maintaining its ferocious velocity.

As the whirlpool inverted, the expansive Qi sea that had filled his dantian began gradually contracting. Though it soon regained its original size, meticulous observation revealed its volume had clearly expanded compared to the previous day. Sensing this growth in his newly formed energy reservoir, Guan Yu's heart swelled with quiet triumph.

"The meridian purification today progressed remarkably faster than yesterday," he mused, wiping sweat from his brow. "Since night hasn't fallen yet... why not attempt another?"

Emboldened by two prior successes, the youth began reciting absorption mantras. This third attempt flowed with practiced ease - within hours, another meridian channel lay cleared. The Qi sea in his dantian now pulsed with doubled vigor!

Exhaustion crashed over him like tidal waves after this dual breakthrough. Collapsing onto his bed, he reflected breathlessly: "Consecutive purifications prove far more grueling than anticipated. Without accumulated experience in regulating energy flow, the second breakthrough would've been impossible tonight. Future endeavors require better preparation - haste makes waste indeed."

Dawn found Guan Yu practicing Force Fist at his usual mountain clearing. "Draw from dantian! Channel through arms! Unify energy! Shatter bone and steel!" His roar echoed through misty peaks as silvery light enveloped his fist. A thunderous boom followed - the trunk of a mature pine exploded into splinters, leaving gaping cavity where solid wood had been.

Staring at his trembling fist, disbelief melted into exhilaration. "This... this is the combined might of Turtle Breath Technique and Force Fist? Astonishing! And this isn't even full power - imagine the devastation when all five meridians unlock!"

Though intoxicated by progress, discipline quickly reasserted itself. "Power means nothing without precision," he cautioned aloud. "Imperfect mastery leaves fatal openings in real combat."

The mountain echoed with percussive strikes throughout daylight hours. As sunset painted clouds crimson, final punch snapped a waist-thick tree mid-trunk. Guan Yu slumped against the fallen giant, arms screaming protest. Rolling up sleeves revealed angry crimson welts crisscrossing his forearms, delicate meridians visible through abraded skin.

"Tch. My physique remains inadequate," he grimaced. "When remaining meridians open, this backlash could cripple me. Physical fortification must accelerate."

The truth lay deeper - simultaneous cultivation of two advanced techniques demanded unprecedented bodily endurance. Concentrating both muscular strength and spiritual energy into limbs created destructive resonance even his silver-veined physique struggled to contain.

Nightfall brought reluctant retreat. At home, foster father Wang Xiao's concerned gaze met his battered form. "Rest tomorrow," the man urged, paternal care piercing stern demeanor.

"Worry not, father," Guan Yu replied, iron resolve glowing in jet-black eyes. "I know my limits."

Wang Xiao swallowed further protests, recognizing the unyielding will that had carried his adopted son through countless trials. "Just... don't break what can't be mended," he finally muttered, shooing the youth upstairs before maternal scrutiny descended.

Alone in his chamber, Guan Yu inspected weeping arm wounds. Through exhaustion, he resumed energy circulation - fourth meridian yielded within thirty minutes. "Enough," he gasped, collapsing onto bed. "The last two must wait."

Unknown to him, the mysterious Stone Heart embedded in his chest began pulsing as sleep claimed consciousness. Ethereal radiance flowed into ravaged arms, flesh knitting faster than mortal healing. But as injuries closed, fresh lacerations appeared - an agonizing cycle of destruction and regeneration lasting hours.

Agony roused Guan Yu to helpless awareness, body paralyzed under the artifact's control. Each cellular rebirth felt like molten lead poured through veins, every rupture akin to flaying knives. Dawn approached before the torment ceased, leaving him drenched in sweat but miraculously whole.

Morning light revealed Wang Xiao's discreetly delivered meal. Tears blurred the youth's vision as he devoured the cold congee. Though fatigue lingered, renewed purpose burned brighter - until a commotion outside drew his attention.

"Brother Guan Yu, look!" Younger disciple Huo Lingling tugged his sleeve, gesturing at giggling female admirers. "These silly girls won't stop staring!"

The youth merely smiled. "True masters conceal emotions, little sister. Consider this... facial paralysis training."

Their laughter drew venomous glares from rival Hu Xiaohai. The senior disciple's fists clenched - soon, he vowed, the upcoming tournament would crush this upstart's arrogance. Though Guan Yu's talent amazed crowds, Hu Xiaohai's nearing-Grand Mage status promised overwhelming advantage.

Yet across the courtyard, Guan Yu's gaze already looked beyond present challenges. Each scar, each drop of sweat, each midnight agony was forging something unprecedented - a weapon honed by ancient artifact and modern will, its true edge yet to be revealed.
