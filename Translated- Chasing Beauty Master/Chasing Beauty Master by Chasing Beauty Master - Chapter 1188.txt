“Cat eyes glow eerily at night, reflecting any faint light with an unsettling gleam that can truly appear frightening.”

Guan Yu reassured, “Don’t be afraid. It’s just a cat—nothing to fear.”

“I don’t care, Guan Yu! Let’s go back now. We can return tomorrow. Hurry!” Lin Qiaoqiao insisted, tugging at Guan Yu’s sleeve. Reluctantly, he acquiesced.

“Fine. We’ll return tomorrow. Let’s hope the Li family doesn’t escape tonight,” Guan Yu said, turning to leave.

Though unafraid himself, Guan Yu worried about Lin Qiaoqiao’s nerves. The Li clan likely hid within their estate’s secret passages. He decided to have Second Only to Wolf keep watch that night, ready to act at any disturbance. The Li family wouldn’t escape easily.

On their way home, Guan Yu asked, “Why are there no cars in this town? A vehicle would make travel much easier.”

Lin Qiaoqiao explained, “Cars aren’t practical here. The roads are unfit, there are no gas stations nearby, and fuel must be fetched from distant areas. Money isn’t omnipotent here—goods are often bartered. Horseback and carriages remain the main transport.”

While cars would burden most families, wealthy clans like the Lin or Li could afford them. Yet without nearby fuel and proper roads, even they relied on horses. The cobblestone streets, though smooth for horses, would jostle cars unbearably. Mountainous dirt paths outside town further discouraged vehicles.

If the Li family owned a car, they might have fled faster. Now, with the entire town hunting them, escape seemed impossible—unless someone like Mayor Wang intentionally let them slip past guards.

Back at the Lin estate, Guan Yu tasked Second Only to Wolf with monitoring the Li residence for any activity. Meanwhile, Lin Zhonggeng sought Guan Yu’s insights.

“Two possibilities,” Guan Yu speculated. “Either they’re still hidden within the Li estate’s secret passages, or someone’s sheltering them until nightfall.”

Lin Zhonggeng frowned. “My men found the Li estate empty. If they were inside, we’d have discovered them.”

“The old manor likely has hidden compartments. More plausibly, allies are sheltering them for a nighttime escape.”

When asked about the Li family’s allies, Lin Zhonggeng revealed Mayor Wang’s familial ties to the Li matriarch. Realizing the mayor might aid their escape, Guan Yu urged surveillance on Wang’s movements.

**Chapter 3049: Major Trouble Approaches**

At dawn, Mayor Wang sat sleepless, agonizing over sheltering the Li family. After secretly releasing Li Gui, he’d hidden the clan in the western coffin shop, planning to smuggle them out under cover of night.

Believing the Li men could escape more easily, Wang decided to send them first. Disguised, he ventured out but soon noticed pursuers. Diverting to the coffin shop, he found himself cornered.

Realizing Lin’s spies tracked him, Wang split from his disguised wife to confuse followers. His wife reached the coffin shop, signaling the hidden Li family with coded knocks. A hidden compartment opened, revealing Li’s matriarch.

“Our men must leave first during the diversion,” Wang’s wife instructed, delivering hidden bread. The Li clan, starving since yesterday, devoured the provisions.

Meanwhile, Wang feigned investigating a murder in the north to distract pursuers. Lin’s forces, now joined by angry villagers, intensified patrols. Wang knew escape grew riskier.

**Chapter 3050: Don’t Ask Questions**

At a northern crime scene, Wang’s men questioned the ruse. “Don’t ask,” he snapped. Crowds gathered as dawn broke, oblivious to the mayor’s true intent. Time pressed—the Li family’s survival hinged on flawless execution.
