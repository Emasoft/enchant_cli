Guan Yu nodded and said, “Very well. Let’s proceed like this: each person will receive two taels of silver per day, starting immediately, until we safely escort His Highness to the capital.”

Observing the hesitant expression of the other party, Guan Yu’s offer was indeed generous. Even the captain looked surprised. Two taels per person daily meant fifty men would cost a hundred taels per day—an astronomical sum. For ordinary folk, earning two taels in a month was already commendable. Though the prince’s coffers were deep, this amount seemed excessive.

The captain even wondered if this “Hong Ren” (Red-Haired One) was secretly colluding with Guan Yu, had he not been the one to introduce him.

Noticing Hong Ren’s continued hesitation, Guan Yu pressed, “If we unite to ensure His Highness’s safe arrival in the capital, whether you earn his future favor will depend on your performance and fortune.”

“Done!” Hong Ren immediately agreed upon hearing this. At two taels per man daily, he would net a hundred taels each day—an irresistible sum. On this mountain stronghold, such earnings would take months to accumulate otherwise. Though the mission’s dangers weighed on him, the promise of wealth and potential rise in the prince’s ranks decided the matter.

“Excellent! Since we’ve settled this, gather your men immediately. If we depart soon, we can reach Silver Town before nightfall,” Guan Yu declared, relieved this hurdle was cleared.

“I’m starving. We haven’t eaten yet,” interjected Wang Xiaorong, determined not to leave without a meal.

“Hahaha! The lady speaks wisely!” Hong Ren laughed heartily. “How thoughtless of me to forget hospitality! Since you’re here, let’s feast first. No harm in delaying briefly.”

They gladly accepted. A lavish lunch was prepared—whole roasted goat over an open fire. Guan Yu, long deprived of wild game, relished the flavorful meal. Wang Xiaorong ate with equal delight.

During the meal, Guan Yu learned Hong Ren’s history: born to peasant parents who were murdered when he was young, he became an orphaned troublemaker in the town—fighting, stealing, and bullying neighborhood girls. By his teens, he led a gang of wayward youths, evolving from local nuisance to protector when foreign slavers began abducting townswomen.

**Chapter 4195: Heroic Deeds**

Hong Ren’s turning point came when slavers took his childhood neighbor—a girl he’d tormented yet felt compelled to save. Rallying his gang, he stormed their compound, freeing captives despite losing a brother in the clash. When corrupt officials arrested him, the townsfolk revolted, besieging the yamen until his release. This victory cemented his reputation, swelling his ranks.

Over years, Hong Ren transformed from street thug to mountain bandit lord, extorting merchant caravans traversing the vital trade route between two major cities. His code of honor—never excessive cruelty—and loyalty to his men earned him six hundred devoted followers.

**Chapter 4196: Relentless Training**

Hong Ren’s leadership stemmed from leading charges in danger and sharing spoils generously. His bare-chested physique, honed through years of daily training after early defeats by martial artists, showcased coiled power capable of lifting a man effortlessly. Though lacking formal cultivation manuals, he’d developed internal energy through sheer will—a testament to his grit.

Guan Yu, moved by parallels to his own rise in A City (though advantaged by powerful backers), recognized Hong Ren’s raw potential. The bandit chief’s integrity beneath rough exterior hinted at a worthwhile ally.

Post-feast, Hong Ren selected fifty men. Guan Yu urged expanding the group: “Bring more capable fighters. I’ll pay two taels per head—no limit.”

“I must leave some to guard our base,” Hong Ren countered pragmatically.

A problem arose: insufficient horses. With only twenty-odd steeds available, Wang Xiaorong proposed splitting the group—riders departing immediately while the captain procured mounts in Commerce Town.

**Chapter 4197: Winning Loyalty**

Guan Yu approved, handing the captain a gold ingot for purchases. “Meet us in Silver Town by nightfall.”

As preparations finalized, Guan Yu reflected on Hong Ren’s journey—a self-made leader whose bloody ascent mirrored his own, yet devoid of privilege. In another life, with proper training, Hong Ren might have soared higher. For now, securing the prince’s safety took precedence, but Guan Yu resolved to revisit this budding camaraderie when circumstances allowed.
