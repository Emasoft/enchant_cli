“It must be said that silence is the most effective approach. Guan Yu couldn’t possibly leave Zhao Jing’er alone at the villa. Patting her small head, he smiled, ‘Jing’er should come along too. You’ve never been to a bar, have you?’”

“Zhao Jing’er nodded vigorously like a pecking chick.”

“Now things were settled—Guan Yu would take his ‘harem’ to dazzle those brutes.”

“Returning to the villa, Niu Le sat alone on the couch munching potato chips while watching Ultraman battle monsters. Guan Yu couldn’t help rolling his eyes. This was utterly baffling—a grown man obsessed with such childish things.”

“Seeing Guan Yu return, Niu Le whined pitifully, ‘Brother, you’re finally back! Guarding this empty nest alone is so lonely.’”

“Guan Yu chuckled, ‘Alright, I’ll take you out tonight. We’re heading to the bar later. Before that, let me give you another treatment. You should be able to walk normally by then.’”

“‘Really?’ At the mention of the bar, Niu Le’s eyes lit up. It had been ages since he’d been near a woman. Tonight, he’d battle two phoenixes with one dragon!”

“Guan Yu nodded, turning to Zhao Jing’er. ‘Jing’er, return to your room. I’ll treat you now.’”

“Zhao Jing’er nodded, a seductive blush blooming on her cheeks as she followed Guan Yu.”

“The other women had grown accustomed to such scenes, each returning to their own affairs.”

“Chapter 385: Guan Yu’s Charisma”

“After a prolonged treatment session, Guan Yu swallowed hard despite himself as he observed Zhao Jing’er in her bra. Though he’d seen and touched her countless times, each encounter brought fresh sensations.”

“Zhao Jing’er glared fiercely. ‘Brother! What are you staring at?’”

“Guan Yu laughed awkwardly. ‘I’ll go treat Niu Le’s leg now.’ He swiftly turned and closed the door behind him.”

“By the time he finished treating Niu Le, Guan Yu was completely drained. Managing two patients was exhausting. He vaguely hoped his system would upgrade again to ease his burden, though how to achieve this remained his greatest headache.”

“After recharging in his room, he regained his vigor.”

“As the appointed time with Wang Zhen approached, he gathered everyone in the living room.”

“Apart from Wen Qing and Feng Xin, the others sat quietly on the sofa. Niu Le grinned foolishly, ‘Brother, why haven’t the two sister-in-laws come down? Shouldn’t you hurry them?’”

“‘You go do it,’ Guan Yu retorted irritably.”

“Niu Le shrunk back, wisely sealing his lips—he’d momentarily forgotten his place.”

“Wen Qing emerged first, her outfit dazzling everyone. A white cotton T-shirt beneath a blazer, skin-tight pants accentuating her curves, and light makeup enhancing her charm.”

“She approached Guan Yu coquettishly. ‘Hubby, do I look pretty like this?’”

“Guan Yu nodded approvingly.”

“Suddenly, his eyes widened comically at the staircase—as if witnessing a world wonder.”

“Feng Xin descended in a black evening gown paired with a blazer, light makeup softening her usual sharpness into allure.”

“Guan Yu’s mind short-circuited. What had gotten into Feng Xin? This elegant, uncharacteristic attire—though undeniably stunning—left him bewildered.”

“Feng Xin descended with uncharacteristic shyness, secretly pleased by Guan Yu’s slack-jawed admiration.”

“‘Sis,’ Guan Yu blurted, ‘is today some special occasion? Why dress so formally?’”

“Feng Xin glared. ‘None of your business! I felt like it.’”

“Guan Yu grinned. ‘I’ve always said you should dress like this. Absolutely radiant.’”

“Zhao Jing’er chimed in, ‘Mm! Sister Xin looks prettier than ever today.’”

“Feng Xin’s heart swelled with delight.”

“Wen Qing snorted softly, muttering, ‘Aren’t you cold dressed like that?’”

“‘What did you say?’ Feng Xin’s eyes flashed dangerously.”

“Seizing the moment, Guan Yu interjected, ‘It’s late. Let’s go before they wait too long.’”

“Miraculously preventing a catfight, Guan Yu grimaced. If this tension erupted at the bar... He shook his head, refusing to dwell on it.”

“Feng Xin drove the Mercedes with four passengers. The unfortunate Niu Le, lacking space, took a taxi without complaint—grateful to escape the feminine gunpowder scent.”

“Since ancient times, the favors of beauties prove hardest to bear.”

“Asadi Bar, managed by Luo Cheng’s crew, greeted Guan Yu’s arrival with dozens lining up outside—a reception fit for state leaders.”

“As Guan Yu alighted, the crowd bowed in unison. ‘Greetings, Brother Yu!’”

“He nearly jumped in shock.”

“When the women emerged, they chorused, ‘Greetings, sister-in-laws!’”

“Guan Yu staggered. Sister-in-laws... plural?”

“Luo Cheng approached smiling. ‘Brother Yu, you’ve neglected us since the opening ceremony. What an irresponsible boss.’”

“Guan Yu glared wryly. ‘Isn’t this reception excessive?’”

“‘Perfectly appropriate,’ Luo Cheng grinned. ‘Your classmates await in the VIP lounge. Let me show you around.’”

“‘Sister Xin, sister-in-laws, this way.’ Luo Cheng gestured grandly.”

“Feng Xin frowned. ‘Luo Cheng! Why distinguish me from them?’”

“Realizing his error, Luo Cheng amended, ‘Sister-in-law, my mistake. I’ll punish myself with three drinks later.’”

“Satisfied, Feng Xin swept inside.”

“Guan Yu stood petrified. What had possessed Feng Xin tonight? Even this trivial distinction mattered enough to demand correction.”

“His mental gears ground helplessly.”

“Luo Cheng shot Guan Yu an admiring thumbs-up behind his back. The man was legendary.”

“Surveying Asadi’s bustling interior, Guan Yu praised, ‘Impressive work, Luo Cheng.’”

“‘Credit belongs to you, Brother Yu,’ Luo Cheng demurred. ‘That opening ceremony drew both underworld and elite—our reputation was made.’”

“Comprehension dawned on Guan Yu.”

“In the VIP lounge, Wang Zhen hailed him. ‘Brother Yu! Finally here! You owe three penalty drinks!’”

“The crowd cheered until Guan Yu’s entourage entered. Four stunning women—each more captivating than the last—stunned them silent.”

“Hu Ge gulped, wiping his eyes in disbelief. ‘A god among men! I bow to your charm!’”

“Though aware of Guan Yu’s flirtations with campus belles, he’d assumed singular pursuits. This four-pronged assault shattered his worldview. The black-gowned woman especially—her figure and face, absolute perfection.”

“Niu Le, arriving earlier, crowed, ‘Why the gaping? Greet the sister-in-laws!’”

“‘Sister-in-laws... plural?’ Hu Ge croaked.”

“Had Guan Yu actually cohabitated with four women? The notion seemed absurd, yet...”

“Chapter 386: The Drowning Woman”

“Hu Ge shook his head, dismissing the ludicrous thought.”

“Guan Yu glanced nervously at the women, finding no displeasure in their expressions. Activating his detection system, he nearly choked.”

“Holy—they all tacitly accepted the title! The harem fantasies he’d envied in historical dramas were now reality. He suppressed a gleeful smirk.”

“But observing Wen Qing and Feng Xin’s rivalry gave him migraines.”

“‘No formalities among brothers!’ Guan Yu declared. ‘Tonight we drink till dawn!’”

“With beauties enlivening the atmosphere, merriment flourished.”

“Hu Ge sidled up to Niu Le, whispering, ‘Brother Niu... all four are sister-in-laws? Living together?’”

“Niu Le smirked meaningfully. ‘Our brother’s charm tames even four goddesses under one roof. I live there too.’”

“Though prepared, Hu Ge felt the world spin. When had society accepted such wonders?”

“Approaching Guan Yu worshipfully, Hu Ge drained his glass. ‘Brother Yu! I’ll follow you forever! Teach me even half your skills!’”

“Others, learning of Guan Yu’s exploits, drowned envy in alcohol—only to find him impervious to their assaults. Unbeknownst to them, his healing system negated intoxication.”

“Their drunken praises of his ‘legendary lust and tolerance’ made Guan Yu roll his eyes—these felt backhanded.”

“He privately mused: ‘And I haven’t even counted Liu Shilei yet...’”

“A minor scuffle arose when Wen Qing, irked by their targeting Guan Yu, rolled up sleeves to drink rivals under the table—matching him cup for cup without system aid. The crowd gaped at this heroine.”

“Not to be outdone, Feng Xin joined the fray, ostensibly ‘defending Du Xiaojuan’s honor.’ Soon both women dueled, relegating others to spectators.”

“Du Xiaojuan and Zhao Jing’er sat demurely aside, smiling at the revelry. Guan Yu kept distance—showing favor risked imbalance. He smoked alone until Wang Zhen stumbled over.”

“‘Brother Yu!’ Wang Zhen slurred, draping an arm over him. ‘I’ve discovered my passion for this club! With proper handling, it could become our post-graduation power base!’”

“As Wang Zhen expounded ambitions, Guan Yu felt pride. ‘Pursue your vision. I’ll support any obstacles.’”

“Wang Zhen’s eyes shone. ‘Really? Brother Yu, I love you!’ He lunged for a hug.”

“‘Get lost!’ Guan Yu laughed, shoving him toward networking.”

“Niu Le sidled up next. ‘Brother, I’m too drunk tonight. Won’t return.’ His leer implied plans to ‘relieve stress’ via paid company—though Guan Yu doubted his endurance post-injury.”

“‘Go on,’ Guan Yu waved. ‘But go easy—you’re still recovering.’”

“As Niu Le scampered off, Zhao Jing’er tilted her head. ‘Brother, where’s Niu Niu going? He didn’t say goodbye.’”

“‘Seeking happiness,’ Guan Yu evaded.”

“‘He has a girlfriend?’ she pressed.”

“‘Must’ve found one recently,’ Guan Yu deflected. ‘Enjoying the bar, Jing’er?’”

“‘It’s fun! Your friends are interesting,’ she beamed.”

“‘I’ll bring you anytime,’ he promised, earning a brighter smile.”

“Suddenly, Du Xiaojuan stood. ‘Guan Yu, I’m visiting the restroom.’”

“‘Need company?’”

“‘No, just too many drinks.’ She left.”

“‘Stupid Guan Yu,’ she muttered en route. ‘Ignored me all night. Hate you!’”

“Passing a table, she froze. A drunken woman—familiar, despairing—caught her eye.”

“‘Teacher Mo?’ Du Xiaojuan gasped. ‘Why are you drinking alone?’”

“The drowning woman was Mo Ling, neglected by Guan Yu.”

“Chapter 387: The Approach”

“Mo Ling glanced up blearily, said nothing, and drained another glass.”

“Du Xiaojuan sat beside her mentor-turned-friend. ‘Stop drinking, Teacher Mo. Let me take you home.’”

“‘Let me indulge...’ Mo Ling slurred. ‘This pain... never again...’”
