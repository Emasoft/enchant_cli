For some reason, Sun Xiaoya felt completely at ease with Guan Yu, as if she'd developed an instinctive reliance on him. Perhaps it was because he'd been caring for her mother. Hearing his words, she playfully retorted, "If I could choose, of course I'd want a lover as handsome as a pretty boy yet worldly as a seasoned uncle. But where could such a person exist?"

Guan Yu secretly smiled. Such a man did exist - right before her eyes. Watching Sun Xiaoya's smiling face, his heart stirred again. He leaned down to plant another deep kiss on her lips.

This time Sun Xiaoya offered little resistance. When Guan Yu finally raised his head, she feigned annoyance: "You rascal! A student daring to flirt with his teacher. Wait - I asked first about your relationship with Liu Shilei. You haven't answered yet, just tricked me into revealing so much."

Guan Yu chuckled, "I'll tell you soon. Since your mother likes that Guan Yu so much, she must have photos? Find one so I can see his face."

Puzzled by his interest but assuming it was due to their shared name, Sun Xiaoya rummaged through her desk until she produced an old album titled "Heroes of the Mysteries". Opening it, she exclaimed, "Ah! All the heroes who entered the Divine Ruins are here. Wait... this can't be! You look exactly like him, just younger!"

Guan Yu peered at the page showing his own photo taken before entering the Demon Tower. -9867+dwruuo+11992269--

Chapter 1666: Ambush

Guan Yu never imagined the Chinese government would publish propaganda albums featuring "heroes" like himself who entered the Demon Tower, let alone place his photo on the first page as their poster boy.

Sun Xiaoya alternated between staring at the album and the man sitting on her bed, unable to believe her eyes.

Guan Yu rubbed his nose and chuckled, "Well? Don't I look better than that photo?"

The young woman remained perplexed. Same name, identical appearance - what explained this?

Suddenly scrambling up, Sun Xiaoya yanked Guan Yu face-to-face. As he tried to kiss her again, she lightly slapped his cheek. "Behave!"

Amused by her seriousness, Guan Yu sat properly on the bed. "Go ahead, inspect me thoroughly."

Sun Xiaoya kneaded his face like dough, half-expecting to peel off a mask. Guan Yu endured her probing hands while his own wandered freely over her body, meeting no resistance as she remained fixated on his face.

After exhaustive examination revealed no disguise, Sun Xiaoya finally relented. "How strange! Could there be such perfect doubles? Wait - are you that Guan Yu's son?"

Guan Yu laughed bitterly, "Miss, have you ever heard of fathers and sons sharing the same name? What if I said I am that Guan Yu?"

To his surprise, Sun Xiaoya nodded. "That must be it! You entered the Divine Ruins around twenty, died there, then your lingering spirit cultivated for twenty years before possessing this body to attend school! I've read about vengeful ghosts clinging to existence through sheer willpower - you must be one!"

Heaven help him! Behind Sun Xiaoya's mature exterior hid this childish imagination. Pulling her close, Guan Yu sighed, "It's not like that. The truth is complicated - listen carefully."

Over two hours, Guan Yu recounted his adventures with the Dragon Group in the Demon Tower and parallel worlds. Though initially skeptical, Sun Xiaoya became utterly engrossed, emotionally invested despite knowing he'd survived.

Concluding his tale, Guan Yu shook the dazed woman in his arms. "Believe me now?"

Mechanically nodding, she asked, "So Liu Shilei truly is your lover? Are there others?"

His light kiss answered her. "Besides her, Du Xiaojuan manages my former enterprises. If this troubles you, we can end things before they progress further."

Instead of jealousy, Sun Xiaoya pondered seriously. "It does bother me... I need time. Aren't you going to Liu Shilei? Goodbye - shut the door on your way out."

Rolling over, she left him staring at her back. As Guan Yu reluctantly departed, he missed her flushed, delighted expression - Heavenly! It's really him!

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, Mrs. Sun's years of extolling the legendary hero had made him Sun Xiaoya's childhood crush. Discovering her idol not only survived but became her student ignited sweet first flutters in her untouched heart.

Chapter 1667: Secret Meeting

Flying through the empty streets past midnight, Guan Yu suddenly sensed imminent danger. Before he could react, a thunderous impact smashed him sideways - a missile strike!

Acrid smoke filled his nostrils as he stabilized midair. White fumes marked the blast site. Damn! Someone ambushed me with military hardware!

"Which bastard dares attack your grandpa?!" Guan Yu roared, composure shattered. "Come face me like a man, you cowardly sneak!"

No response came except lights flickering on in nearby apartments. Not wanting to panic civilians, Guan Yu landed on a rooftop and expanded his spiritual sense.

He soon detected a camouflage-painted military truck 300 meters away, its mounted missile launcher still warm. Soldiers argued inside:

"Captain! You said we were targeting an unidentified aircraft! That was clearly a flying man! How's he alive after a direct hit?!"

The flustered officer dialed superiors: "Target survived missile strike. Appears to be... human." Receiving withdrawal orders, he barked, "Fall back to base!"

"Oh no you don't!" Guan Yu growled. His romantic mood ruined, he trailed the speeding truck through backroads until it vanished into a mountainside that split open, revealing a hidden base.

Darting inside before the door sealed, Guan Yu confronted stunned guards. "Your boys shot me in the back! I'm here to settle accounts!"

Escorted past layers of security into an underground complex rivaling his school's size, Guan Yu found six men awaiting - four military officers and two in Zhongshan suits.

A civilian approached smiling: "Comrade Guan Yu, welcome back."

Chapter 1668: Eastern Island Conspiracy

Guan Yu instantly recognized Dragon Group operatives. Coldly crossing his arms, he retorted, "Comrades don't ambush with missiles."

Unfazed, the agent explained, "Our actions were... impulsive. After Typist Xue Yingfeng reported your resurgence with power surpassing first-class mutants, we needed to test new anti-mutant weapons. The missile was merely..."

Guan Yu's glare could freeze lava. The man continued undaunted, "...purely experimental. Now that we've confirmed your capabilities, we require your assistance. Eastern Island's mutants plan to..."
