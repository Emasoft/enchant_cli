“Thank you for the reminder, Master. Otherwise, I'd still be foolishly pondering whether I could cultivate magic. So all the spiritual energy I've accumulated these days has been stored in the Luohun Blade? I really am dense,” Guan Yu said with a bitter smile.

“Dense?” Xuan Ming walked before Guan Yu, smiling. “Guan Yu, since you returned after accompanying your friend to seek treatment, barely a month has passed. Yet your cultivation progress in this short time surpasses that of ordinary disciples by more than double.”

Guan Yu widened his eyes, clearly unable to believe he possessed such talent. “Master, if you're merely encouraging me, I accept it—and I'll strive even harder,” he said gloomily.

Xuan Ming shook his head and pointed to the hilt of the Luohun Blade. At the end of the hilt, where the black dragon’s tail coiled, lay a small black bead. “Guan Yu, you should know the Luohun Blade is an ancient artifact—calling it an immortal weapon wouldn’t be excessive. Its capacity to store spiritual energy far exceeds ordinary artifacts, even surpassing some immortal tools. This bead here is its energy storage core. What it’s truly called, even I don’t know, for this blade’s origins stretch too far into antiquity.”

After Xuan Ming’s explanation, Guan Yu lifted the blade for closer inspection. Indeed, at the hilt’s end sat a small black bead he’d previously noticed but dismissed. Blending with the blade’s dark hue, it seemed inconspicuous. The bead, barely two centimeters wide, now appeared smudged with stubborn white stains Guan Yu couldn’t wipe away.

“This bead indicates how much spiritual energy the Luohun Blade holds,” Xuan Ming continued. “Do you see the white patterns on its surface?”

Guan Yu nodded. “I thought I’d dirtied it. Strange—they won’t rub off.”

Xuan Ming chuckled ruefully. “Ah, Guan Yu, you’re truly unique. You oscillate between childlike ignorance and sudden worldly wisdom. Those white veins aren’t stains but inherent markings that display capacity. When fully charged, this black bead will turn entirely white.”

“So these white traces... they’re my spiritual energy?” Guan Yu exclaimed.

Currently, the white patterns occupied about a tenth of the bead’s surface. “Precisely. Quick to grasp—you’re teachable indeed,” Xuan Ming praised. “For less than a month’s cultivation, this progress is remarkable.”

He elaborated on cultivation fundamentals: spiritual energy’s primacy over techniques, the interdependence of energy reserves and advanced spells, and Guan Yu’s current need for patient accumulation. “The Emperor’s Seal allows others to assist in storing spells, but a weapon’s energy must be channeled by its wielder alone. High-grade artifacts like this amplify their owner’s power—the same spell through such a blade becomes devastating.”

Guan Yu bowed. “My apologies for my ignorance. Thank you for your guidance.”

“The fault lies with me,” Xuan Ming admitted. “Novices require close supervision to avoid qi deviation. I intended to instruct you after your return from the mountains, yet you’ve advanced through sheer comprehension.”

Realization dawned on Guan Yu—even basic sword flight drained energy. Every spell demanded spiritual power, with complexity escalating costs. Forcing advanced techniques without sufficient reserves risked lethal backlash. His stored energy explained previous failures; without the blade’s reservoir, his meager internal reserves proved inadequate.

Xuan Ming clasped Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Stay at Tiger’s Head Peak for training. The Six Peaks Assembly approaches—I expect outstanding performance.”

“What occurs at this assembly? Do peaks showcase delicacies?” Guan Yu feigned ignorance.

“That’s but a minor aspect,” Xuan Ming laughed. “Each peak’s leader brings their best disciples for sparring. Victors gain treasures and elite training—future pillars of our sect.”

Guan Yu probed further, though already informed. The master detailed tragic past competitions where ambition turned deadly, emphasizing the coveted rewards: the Virtuous Cauldron’s empowerment and rare artifacts. “This year, we’ll select four champions for advanced teachings and artifacts.”

“Why hold it only every century? More frequent contests might yield more talents,” Guan Yu suggested.

Xuan Ming agreed, revealing reformed plans for decennial selections to motivate disciples. Pressed about participation, the master insisted: “Why not? You’re a prodigy. With the Emperor’s Seal, none will dare challenge you seriously.”

Guan Yu balked at facing decades-trained peers, but Xuan Ming revealed his scheme—flaunting the Emperor’s Seal would intimidate opponents, sparing the sect from gifting another artifact. The master’s earlier generosity now showed calculated thrift.

“So I’m to bully peers with this treasure?” Guan Yu sighed, recognizing Xuan Ming’s stinginess with sect relics. Yet he acquiesced, vowing not to shame his master—while privately lamenting the sect’s decline through masters hoarding knowledge and tools.

Thus preparations advanced, with Xuan Ming even recruiting Guan Yu’s portly rival Lin Chen for the spectacle. The stage was set—not for fair competition, but for a master’s frugal theatrics.
