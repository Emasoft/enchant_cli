He assumed a pampered young lady like Dongfang Huowu (Dancing Flame) had never experienced being hauled into custody. But he forgot—this formidable daughter of the Dongfang clan had likely visited police stations more often than tea shops.

Upon hearing his remark, she rolled her luminous eyes and sneered, “What’s so interesting about that place? Just a bunch of stinking men! I’ve been there countless times!”

Guan Yu broke into a cold sweat, suddenly recalling that this young miss had once kicked a man’s groin in stilettos. Given her violent tendencies, frequent police station visits were practically routine.

Truthfully, Guan Yu had followed the two officers to the station out of sheer boredom—and partly due to Dongfang Huowu’s involvement.

If the Dongfang family learned their treasured heiress had nearly been assaulted by thugs, they’d undoubtedly unleash chaos. Since the incident occurred under his watch, he’d handle the fallout.

He wanted to see just how far a petty officer would go to threaten him.

Soon, the patrol car arrived at the Kyoto Public Security Bureau’s branch. Officer Wang flung the door open and barked at Guan Yu and Dongfang Huowu, “You two wait here!” before storming inside.

“Handsome *gege*, how do you think he’ll deal with us?” Dongfang Huowu asked with a coy smile.

The young officer stammered, “D-don’t call me *gege*. I’m not much older. My name’s Li Yiyang—just address me as Officer Li.”

“Oh!” She nodded obediently. “Then, Officer Li, how will that Officer Wang punish us?”

“I... I don’t know.”

Li Yiyang frowned. Fresh out of the police academy, he’d only worked at the branch for two days. His mentor’s ruthlessness surprised him. Earlier, he’d overheard Officer Wang’s phone call with Scarface—the trio of thieves beaten by this pair had suffered horrifying injuries.

Scarface fared better, as Dongfang Huowu lacked Guan Yu’s brute strength. The other two weren’t so lucky. At the hospital, doctors took one glance and declared their manhoods destroyed—testicles crushed beyond repair.

Even Li felt his stomach churn. Who’d have guessed these refined-looking youths could deliver such vicious kicks?

Scarface happened to be Officer Wang’s mistress’s brother. Whether out of duty or self-interest, the officers couldn’t let the pair walk free. But Li detected darker intentions in Wang’s tone—they meant to bury this case.

Hesitating, Li wondered: If Wang bypassed protocol, should he intervene?

Suddenly, Wang descended the stairs with several uniformed men.

“Old Wang, these the ones?”

“Yeah, them!” Wang’s expression twisted. Strictly speaking, Scarface wasn’t his brother-in-law—just his mistress’s sibling. But if his sugar baby discovered he’d ignored her brother’s maiming, his bedroom privileges would vanish.

“Get out!” The seasoned officers lunged to drag Guan Yu and Dongfang Huowu from the car.

As Guan Yu prepared to kick them away, Li stepped forward. “Brother Song! They’re only suspects. We should wait for the Criminal Division to process them!”

The veterans erupted. “Li Yiyang! You greenhorn dare lecture us? Know your place!”

“I’m not lecturing. Just following procedure. Let me take them for interrogation.”

Li had joined the force to uphold justice. Seeing these corrupt officers overreach, he blocked their path.

“You goddamn punk!” Officer Song roared. “Want to lose your job? I’ll have you fired today!”

Though not a captain, ousting a rookie without connections was child’s play.

“Even if you fire me, I won’t let you take them!”

**Chapter 1034: Kicking an Iron Plate**

“Screw this! Drag him aside!” Song bellowed. The commotion made it seem Guan Yu had personally wronged him.

Guan Yu’s respect for Li grew. As the officers manhandled the rookie, he coldly snorted and effortlessly floored Song’s group.

Dongfang Huowu clapped gleefully.

Li stared at the fallen men and sighed. “You... this’ll bring trouble.”

The trouble arrived swiftly. Dozens of officers swarmed the courtyard—riot shields, batons, pistols, even SWAT teams. They treated Guan Yu like a terrorist.

A potbellied man with a star insignia stormed out. “Li Yiyang! You brought these thugs here?”

“Political Commissar Zhou, they’re not—” Li rushed to explain.

Zhou turned to Wang and Song. “Well?”

“They brutally assaulted youths near Sakura Supermarket,” Wang lied smoothly. “Officer Song tried to detain them, but this rookie obstructed justice!”

The veterans chorused agreement, their seasoned tongues weaving fiction.

Zhou cut off Li’s protests. “Enough! Arrest these two. I’ll interrogate them personally. As for you, Li—consider this a formal reprimand.”

Li paled. The corrupt officers smirked triumphantly.

Guan Yu patted Li’s shoulder. “Relax. No one’s reprimanding you.”

Zhou’s phone rang. The branch chief’s roar echoed across the courtyard: “What the hell have you done?!”

“Sir, we only detained two troublemakers without connections—”

“You blind fool!” the chief thundered. “Release them immediately! Treat them like royalty! If they’re displeased, you’re fired!”

The line went dead. Zhou turned ashen.

“Release them?” A bewildered officer asked.

“Release them NOW!” Zhou shoved past his men, bowing obsequiously to Guan Yu. “Sir, this was all a misunderstanding! Please, let’s discuss this in my office!”

Dozens of jaws dropped. Political Commissar Zhou groveling before suspects?

Li finally understood Guan Yu’s earlier assurance. Wang and Song’s faces drained of color—they’d provoked someone far beyond their station.

**Chapter 1035: The Setup**

Guan Yu smirked. He’d texted Wang Dahu (Big Tiger) earlier. The Wang family’s influence in law enforcement ensured this outcome.

Zhou fawned over them in his office until dismissed.

“Fetch Li Yiyang!” Zhou barked.

When Li arrived, Zhou oozed false warmth. “Any difficulties at work? We need upright officers like you!”

Li saw through the act. Without Guan Yu’s clout, he’d remain invisible.

Zhou probed for Guan Yu’s background, but Li knew nothing.

Dismissed, Li left Zhou sweating over his doomed career.

Guan Yu and Dongfang Huowu sipped tea, their ordeal concluding as power dynamics shifted—proof that in Kyoto’s intricate web, even wolves sometimes bite iron.
