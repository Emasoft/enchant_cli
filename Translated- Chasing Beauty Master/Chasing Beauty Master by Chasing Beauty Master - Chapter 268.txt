“Originally, I had planned to spend the night in passionate embraces with Liu Shilei, but now I’m stuck in a room with a hitman who enjoys watching *Grey Wolf*. How tragically ironic life can be.

What was meant to be a night of tender affection turned into a marathon phone call.

Perched by the window with a cigarette dangling from his lips, Guan Yu listened quietly as Liu Shilei poured out her grievances over the phone. The conversation lasted until her battery died, leaving her reluctantly hanging up.

After the call, Guan Yu sank into deep contemplation.

Lin Dong glanced in Guan Yu’s direction before turning back with a solemn expression to watch *Grey Wolf*’s comical antics of tricking lambs on screen.

It was baffling—a former top-tier assassin engrossed in cartoons. Even more absurd was how this slapstick comedy had him looking as grave as if analyzing a battlefield. Truly an oddball.

“Finished gathering intel?” Lin Dong suddenly remarked.

Guan Yu took a drag and hummed noncommittally.

“And the verdict?” Lin Dong’s eyes remained glued to the TV.

“Worse than expected,” Guan Yu stubbed out his cigarette. “Aside from Shilei’s gentle, long-suffering mother, the rest of her family is a headache. Her father runs a small business—barely scraping by—but his gambling addiction drags them all down. He blows every spare cent at the tables, losing nine times out of ten. The one win? Probably the bookies reeling him in for bigger losses.”

Guan Yu snorted. “His recklessness turned a comfortable life into a financial quagmire. What pisses me off is how he recently snatched jewelry worth nearly a million that I gave Shilei. She’d shared some with her mother, but her father found out, pawned it for gambling money, lost everything overnight, and left them drowning in loan sharks’ debts. They had to liquidate business assets to settle it.”

“As for her brother Liu Jie—spoiled rotten. That ridiculous mohawk makes me want to shave his head. Fifteen years old and already a veteran of vice: drinking, whoring, gambling. Only drugs are off-limits... for now. Their mother and Shilei suffer endlessly because of these two. Shilei never mentioned any of this before. If her father hadn’t picked a fight with me today, she’d still be swallowing her tears.”

“So you plan to fix their family drama?” Lin Dong mocked.

“Exactly.” Guan Yu’s tone hardened. “I don’t care what becomes of those two. But my wife and mother-in-law won’t keep suffering for their mistakes.”

“What a devoted son-in-law,” Lin Dong sneered. “Planning to intimidate them into submission? That’s just a band-aid solution.”

Guan Yu smirked. “There’s always a way. If needed, I’ll administer bitter medicine—one dose strong enough to leave a lasting lesson.”

Lin Dong raised an eyebrow. “Who’s first? Don’t expect me to play the villain while you swoop in as the hero.”

**Chapter 679: A Weasel Paying New Year’s Respects to a Chicken**

In-law tensions are notoriously tricky—especially when the prospective son-in-law’s worth is measured by his wallet.

Lin Dong’s message was clear: he refused to be the bad cop in Guan Yu’s good-cop routine.

Guan Yu chuckled darkly. “I’d never push a brother into hell alone. We’ll walk through fire together—as co-villains.”

“Should I fetch sacks for kidnapping?” Lin Dong deadpanned.

“We’re civilized men,” Guan Yu chided. “No brute force. We persuade with virtue and reason.”

Lin Dong would sooner believe in aliens than Guan Yu’s “civilized” approach.

“I neglected bonding with my future brother-in-law tonight,” Guan Yu mused faux-remorsefully. “Must apologize tomorrow.”

Lin Dong recognized the hypocrisy—this was pure pretext to discipline Liu Jie.

A phone rang. Guan Yu answered the unknown number, listening to a commanding voice without interruption.

Hanging up, he grinned. “How touching—my dear brother-in-law misses me too. Invited me to some bar. Eager to ‘strengthen our bond,’ apparently.”

“A weasel’s New Year greeting,” Lin Dong bluntly assessed.

“Coming? Might find a nice girl there,” Guan Yu teased.

“Wouldn’t miss this show. Let’s see what trap the kid’s set.”

At the designated bar, they found Liu Jie搂搂抱抱 a heavily made-up woman twice his age, crooning duets with drunken passion.

Guan Yu felt ancient watching the underage delinquent openly flaunt his debauchery. Was this today’s youth? Had society decayed, or had he grown obsolete?

Entering the VIP room, Guan Yu greeted his future brother-in-law warmly—only to be ignored mid-song. Unfazed, he waited, curious about Liu Jie’s game.

When the song ended, Liu Jie finally acknowledged him. “Order girls. All types available. My treat.”

“I’m a taken man,” Guan Yu feigned reluctance, inwardly scoffing at the obvious trap: accept, and face accusations of infidelity.

“Plus,” Guan Yu added pointedly, “shouldn’t *you* avoid such places? Your sister would be furious.”

Liu Jie sneered. “Stick-in-the-mud guys repel everyone—girls, guys, me.”

“Thank heavens,” Guan Yu gasped mockingly. “You swing *that* way?”

The teen flushed crimson. “Fuck you! I’ve fucked real women! I’m straight!”

“Fucking doesn’t prove orientation,” Guan Yu remarked coolly.

“YOU MOTHERF—”

*SLAP!*

The crack echoed over the music. Liu Jie spun mid-air before collapsing onto the couch, clutching his swelling face in disbelief.

“You... you hit me?!” he screeched.

*SLAP!*

Another blow silenced him. Trembling, he realized this man didn’t care about familial diplomacy.

“Thought being my future brother-in-law made you untouchable?” Guan Yu loomed over him. “Wrong. Older brothers discipline younger ones—one slap from your sister, another from your mother. If you were my blood, I’d break your legs to keep you from corrupting society.”

**Chapter 680: I’m From the Underworld**

Lin Dong snacked on melon seeds, amused by Guan Yu’s “civilized persuasion.”

Guan Yu continued, “Puzzling—you’re no rich kid. Where’d you get cash for whores?”

Liu Jie stayed mute, unwilling to admit funds came from gambling, family scams, or sugar mommies.

“Ah!” Guan Yu feigned enlightenment. “Pretty-boy earnings? Shame to waste those looks on petty gigolo work.”

“BULLSHIT!” Liu Jie erupted. “My money’s clean!”

“Methinks he doth protest too much,” Guan Yu mused, inspecting him. “Honestly, you’ve got the face for it. Wasted potential.”

“I’M IN THE UNDERWORLD!” Liu Jie blustered. “Push me, and you’ll spend New Year in a hospital!”

“Oh?” Guan Yu’s smile turned glacial. “You’d have been hospitalized earlier if I’d known. Playing gangster? Think you’re some badass from *Young and Dangerous*?”

Eight thugs barged in, led by a sneering youth. “Who’s messing with my boy?!”

“You recruited him?” Guan Yu’s voice dripped menace.
