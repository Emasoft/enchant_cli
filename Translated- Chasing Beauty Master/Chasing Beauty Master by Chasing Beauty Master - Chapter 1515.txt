“Hehe, how could we impose? Weren’t these meant to be delivered to the back? We can’t take them,” the disciple demurred.

“Nonsense! Today is Red Lotus Sect’s annual celebration. Thanks to the Sect Leader’s generosity, there’s enough food and drink to last three days and nights! Don’t stand on ceremony—I’ll fetch another batch later for Song Di at the rear,” Yan Zhao replied, taking the wooden box from Santou’s hands. “Take these too. Meat and wine—enjoy them at your leisure.”

After setting down both boxes and unpacking the food, Yan Zhao turned and left with Santou. Rounding a corner, Santou whispered, “Did you poison the food?”

“Of course not,” Yan Zhao hissed. “Knocking them out now would alert others. This is just to make them indebted. Come—we’re returning to the kitchen.”

The bustling kitchen teemed with stewards directing traffic. Unnoticed, Yan Zhao and Santou grabbed more dishes and wine before slipping back. Peering around the bend, they watched the guards laughing as they feasted.

Yan Zhao strode forward, boxes in hand. “How’s the fare, brothers? Need more?”

“Enough! Thank you! We’ve been stationed here since dawn without a bite. You’ve saved us!” a disciple said between gulps.

“Ah! My foolish head!” Yan Zhao slapped his brow theatrically. “I forgot to fetch the Elder’s token!” He rounded on Santou. “Useless oaf! Why didn’t you remind me? Now I must run back!”

Santou played along, bowing. “Apologies! I thought tokens weren’t needed for deliveries. Let me retrieve it—”

“No need,” a guard interjected. “You’ve fed us well—pass through. We’ll open the gate.”

Seizing the moment, Yan Zhao grinned. “Many thanks! We’ll deliver these and return promptly.” He snapped at Santou, “Quit dawdling! Move!”

Once past the iron gate, they hurried onward. Santou exhaled. “Clever act. That ‘furious scolding’ bit was masterful.”

“Naturally. Were I incompetent, the Demon Lord wouldn’t have sent me,” Yan Zhao retorted, chin high.

**Chapter 3929: Disguised**

Santou reflected that despite Yan Zhao’s vile nature, his cunning and ambition made him invaluable. The Demon Lord excelled at exploiting such talents.

The mission’s prize—Red Lotus Sect’s Myriad Symbol Disk—was said to connect to the Eight-Faced Drums, artifacts forged by Ancestor Menghua. While the drums became four martial treatises, the Disk remained sealed within the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Lotus.

This glacial prison also held the Six-Headed Wolf King, a millennium-old beast subdued by Red Lotus’ founders. Even the Demon Lord feared approaching, relying instead on Santou—a wolf-descendant—to infiltrate using the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Gu.

**Chapter 3930: Forced Entry**

At the mountain courtyard’s gate, guards halted them. “Who goes there?”

“We’ve brought celebratory feasts!” Yan Zhao beamed, unveiling fragrant dishes. “Eat your fill!”

Though tempted, a guard demanded, “Show the Elder’s token.”

“A lowly server needs no token,” Yan Zhao chuckled, pouring wine. “The inner guards know me.”

As the men drooled, he insisted, “Rest assured—we’ll leave promptly.” When they relented, he slipped powder into the wine.

Retreating to the woods, Santou hissed, “Poison? What of the sleeping officer?”

“We’ll handle him,” Yan Zhao muttered. Moments later, guards collapsed foaming.

Before Santou could protest, a groggy figure emerged—Yue Jing, his nemesis. Yan Zhao lunged, sword flashing. A needle pierced Yue Jing’s eye as he fled behind a smoke screen.

“Quickly!” Santou urged. They scaled the wall to a weed-choked courtyard. A stone stair led to the cavernous maw of the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Lotus.

“Draw out the guardian elder,” Santou ordered. “I’ll enter once he’s distracted.”

“Hurry!” Yan Zhao snapped. “If Yue Jing alerts them…”

Their window was closing. Beyond lay the Myriad Symbol Disk—and destiny.
