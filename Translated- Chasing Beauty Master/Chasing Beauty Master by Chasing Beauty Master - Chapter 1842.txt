“It was just an accident. The stage in our theater hadn’t been repaired for a long time and collapsed during a performance, but everything’s fine now. We owe much of this to Wan Hong’s help,” Chu Fan said with a chuckle, downplaying the incident to avoid worrying Jiang Xin.

“Wan Hong is a terrible person, Chu Fan. You should stay away from him. You have no idea how he treated me when he visited my home—he nearly scared me to death!” Jiang Xin pouted resentfully, then added with a giggle, “Though terrifying at the time, looking back now, it was actually quite amusing!”

“You’re such a mischief-maker, always thinking of fun,” Chu Fan replied, laughing. “Wan Hong has helped us tremendously. He even invited me to a grand feast at Wanyang Restaurant earlier. Hahaha!” Seeing Jiang Xin’s familiar warmth and concern toward him, Chu Fan felt all other worries melt away, leaving only joy.

“Oh? He’s truly generous. Every time he acts, it’s with such extravagance.” Jiang Xin, who had once loathed Guan Yu, now found herself slowly acknowledging that this man might indeed be capable.

Moreover, despite his short time in the capital and limited actions, he had grown close to her parents and forged such a strong bond with Chu Fan.

With everyone around her speaking well of him, Jiang Xin saw no reason to hold onto her anger. Her playful spirit rekindled as she pondered.

“Wan Hong, why are you standing there like a fool? Didn’t you say you’d treat Chu Fan to a feast at Wanyang Restaurant? Perfect—I haven’t eaten either. Can I bring a plus-one?” Jiang Xin teased impishly.

“Of course. I can afford a meal, and you’re welcome to bring family. Even if Chu Fan brings you, or if you both bring children, I’ll ensure everyone leaves well-fed and satisfied. You have my word,” Guan Yu replied.

**Chapter 4840: Inappropriate**

“Haha, splendid! You continue to surprise me with your generosity and magnanimity,” Jiang Xin said cheerfully. She stepped closer to Guan Yu, pouting with a pleading expression. “Wan Hong, I knew you were a good person! Last time at my home, you made me fly—but I was too frightened to enjoy it properly. Could you take me flying again now?”

Guan Yu shook his head without hesitation. “No. You were terrified and berated me harshly. I won’t take that risk again.”

He couldn’t recklessly use spiritual power here. Flight spells easily revealed his identity as a disciple of Yunqing Sect, inviting unwanted trouble. His previous use of spiritual energy outside the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence had drawn crowds and provoked intense questioning from the Grand Princess.

To protect his hidden identity, Guan Yu absolutely could not cast spells openly here.

“First you’re generous, then suddenly stingy!” Jiang Xin sulked. “Please? Just one more flight? I’m begging you!”

Her clingy nature flared as she gripped Guan Yu’s arm, swaying it back and forth with wide, imploring eyes.

Faced with such a display, refusal seemed impossible—not just for Guan Yu, but any man. The sheer charm was devastating.

Chu Fan watched with an amused, helpless smile. Accustomed to Jiang Xin’s antics, he found perverse delight in seeing Guan Yu endure her whims. Jiang Xin, ever the playful soul, craved adventure beyond the mundane. If someone could make her soar, her joy would know no bounds.

As Guan Yu pondered an escape, a sharp voice cut through the air: “Remove your filthy hands! Who allowed you to touch him?”

Though the speaker remained unseen, Guan Yu recognized the voice instantly. Goosebumps erupted across his skin, his scalp prickling with dread.

There was no mistaking it—Wang Xiaorong had arrived.

Sure enough, behind Jiang Xin’s soldiers emerged two women, one tall and one petite. Guan Yu spotted them from afar.

Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi had reached the capital the previous day but failed to locate Guan Yu, forcing them to wait. Since he used the alias “Wan Hong,” their search proved futile. While idly strolling, they’d noticed an opulent carriage and followed the commotion.

From a distance, Wang Xiaorong had immediately recognized Guan Yu—and the princess-like girl clinging to him. Fury ignited in both women.

Chu Fan and Jiang Xin now noticed the two peerless beauties approaching through the crowd. Initially, Jiang Xin didn’t realize their words targeted her, thinking she’d misheard.

Though the capital boasted many fair maidens, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi’s beauty stood unmatched. Their radiance dwarfed ordinary standards. Chu Fan stared in astonishment, piecing together their connection to “Wan Hong.”

Guan Yu forced a smile. “You two arrived quicker than expected.”

“Of course! Any later, and the situation might’ve worsened, no?” Wang Xiaorong retorted, striding forward with Qiqi. Her gaze locked onto Jiang Xin.

After scrutinizing the girl, Wang Xiaorong nodded. “Hmm, truly a beauty. No wonder you’re glued to Guan Yu. Ordinary women wouldn’t catch his eye.”

Though her words sounded measured, acidic jealousy dripped beneath them.

“I, Wan Hong, am no philanderer. This is a misunderstanding,” Guan Yu hastily clarified, emphasizing his alias while meeting Wang Xiaorong’s eyes meaningfully. She caught the hint.

Qiqi, equally displeased, pointed at Jiang Xin. “Miss, what relation are you to him? How dare you cling to a man so brazenly in broad daylight? Is this proper behavior?”

Jiang Xin maintained her hold, provoking Wang Xiaorong further. “Release his hand! Have you no shame, pawing at another woman’s man?”

“This is a misunderstanding,” Guan Yu interjected. “We were merely jesting. This is Lady Jiang, daughter of the Imperial Son-in-Law’s household and a郡主 (Junzhu) personally enfeoffed by His Majesty.”

“I care not for titles! Release him—now!” Wang Xiaorong snapped, temper flaring.

Refusing to back down, Jiang Xin lifted her chin defiantly. “Who are you? My interactions with a friend are none of your concern!”

“Cut the nonsense! We’re his wives. How dare you, a noble lady, disgrace yourself by publicly fondling our husband? Have you no decency?” Wang Xiaorong planted her hands on her hips.

Jiang Xin instantly released Guan Yu’s arm, cheeks flushing crimson. Never before had she been called “indecent.” Facing the wives’ wrath, she realized her playful antics had crossed lines.

Chu Fan arched an eyebrow, sensing trouble. Guan Yu had mentioned a fiancée, which Chu Fan believed—a man of his caliber would naturally marry young. But he hadn’t anticipated wives of such stunning beauty, especially the taller one whose looks surpassed even Jiang Xin’s. Chu Fan couldn’t help but admire.

**Chapter 4841: A Favor to Ask**

Though uninvolved, Chu Fan watched with amused curiosity, eager to see how Guan Yu would extricate himself from this romantic tangle.

Guan Yu smiled wryly. “You arrived faster than anticipated. I’d guessed you’d be here soon.”

“Hmph! Any later, and someone might’ve stolen you away,” Wang Xiaorong retorted, shooting daggers at Jiang Xin.

Jiang Xin sidled closer to Chu Fan, silent and chastened. The accusation of impropriety stung her pride.

Chu Fan noted the tension. These women’s sharp tones suggested no easy reconciliation, yet Guan Yu remained calm, almost amused.

“Never. You know my resolve. This minor episode won’t sway me,” Guan Yu chuckled.

“Pah! With such a refined beauty, even ghosts wouldn’t believe you’d resist!” Wang Xiaorong huffed, her jealousy thinly veiled. To her, Guan Yu remained the most sought-after man in the martial world—a constant vigilance required to prevent his harem from expanding.

Chu Fan found the scene baffling. He’d expected explosive fury—wives yanking ears, demanding explanations. Instead, peace prevailed. Guan Yu’s composure and the women’s quick appeasement defied expectations.

“Enough teasing. Those two are the actual couple. What you saw earlier was just a jest,” Guan Yu explained smoothly. “Lady Jiang needed a favor, hence the scene. Let me introduce you properly: this is my sworn brother Chu Fan, and this is Lady Jiang,郡主 (Junzhu) of the Imperial Son-in-Law’s household.”

“Oh? How novel—you’d relinquish such a beauty to another?” Wang Xiaorong’s sarcasm softened as she accepted the explanation.

Approaching Chu Fan, Wang Xiaorong scrutinized Jiang Xin. Despite the girl’s noble status and beauty, Wang Xiaorong remained unimpressed—though she couldn’t deny Jiang Xin’s charms.

“Greetings, Chu Fan. I am Wan Hong’s first wife, Wang Xiaorong,” she said, nearly slipping with Guan Yu’s real name but catching herself.

Qiqi piped up, “And I’m his second wife, Qiqi!”

“A pleasure,” Chu Fan replied courteously. Studying Qiqi’s youthful face, he blurted, “Qiqi, may I ask your age? To marry so young… Wan Hong, this seems rather…”

“I chose this willingly! Though young, I’m highly capable!” Qiqi declared with childish pride, amplifying her babyish tone.

Guan Yu smiled awkwardly. His relationship with Qiqi had begun unexpectedly through her persistence—a matter now beyond debate.

“Now that we’re acquainted, let’s all dine at Wanyang Restaurant,” Guan Yu提议 cheerfully.

Chu Fan marveled at the sudden shift from confrontation to camaraderie. Guan Yu’s wives, despite their earlier fury, now followed his lead obediently—a testament to his charm.

“Excellent! Sister Xiaorong and I came out precisely for breakfast!” Qiqi exclaimed. Petite and youthful, her love for food remained unmatched.

Plans settled, Jiang Xin and Chu Fan rode her carriage while Guan Yu’s group walked. The distance proved negligible.

Walking arm-in-arm with his wives, Guan Yu savored their reunion. Wang Xiaorong clung to his right, Qiqi nuzzling his left.

As the carriage rolled ahead, Wang Xiaorong whispered, “Why use a false name here? Is Chu Fan truly a friend, or do you have ulterior motives?”

Qiqi echoed the question.

“The alias hides my identity,” Guan Yu explained. “If discovered as Guan Yu of Yunqing Sect, factions would hound me. As ‘Wan Hong,’ even your Demon Soul Sect remains unaware—granting peace.”

“As for Chu Fan, he’s a good man and true friend, albeit somewhat solitary. Don’t mind his quirks.”

**Chapter 4842: Conflict**

Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi knew better than to question Guan Yu’s plans. Their role was support, not interference.

“Seeing you again feels wonderfully refreshing,” Qiqi sighed, nestling closer.

“Have you practiced diligently lately?” Guan Yu asked.

“Of course! I train rain or shine—Sister Xiaorong can attest!” Qiqi vowed.

“She’s relentless,” Wang Xiaorong confirmed. “Even in downpours, she drills forms outdoors.”

“How are your grandparents?” Guan Yu inquired.

“I haven’t visited, but Grandfather sent letters. Thanks to your silver, they’ve hired help for Grandmother. He still performs street acts occasionally—old habits die hard—but they’re content.”

“Was the silver insufficient? They needn’t work!” Guan Yu frowned.

Qiqi laughed. “They’re frugal by nature. Your funds could last years! Grandfather enjoys performing—it’s his passion, not necessity.”

Their conversation meandered until Wanyang Restaurant loomed ahead, its grandeur promising respite from the morning’s drama. Yet as they approached, tensions lingered—a reminder that in the capital’s intricate web of power and passion, no feast came without its shadows.
