**Chapter 3786: Kicking Someone When They’re Down**

Xiao Zhi’s loud cries drew many disciples rushing over. “What happened?”

“Let’s go see. What’s going on?”

Yan Zhao, noticing the growing crowd, swiftly stored the millennium-old peachwood and feigned concern. “Xiao Zhi, what’s wrong? Are you alright?” Simultaneously, he channeled a surge of spiritual energy into Xiao Zhi’s body unnoticed.

The virulent Blood Toxin, upon encountering the spiritual energy of Yunqing Sect, erupted violently. Yan Zhao’s interference instantly triggered the Blood Toxin within Xiao Zhi.

Within moments, Xiao Zhi’s eyes turned blood-red. His body swelled grotesquely, black fur sprouting across his skin as elongated fangs protruded from his mouth. Though less terrifying than Yan Zhao’s bestial transformations, the sight was horrifying enough.

The commotion near Tigerhead Peak’s main hall drew out the Sect Leader and all Chiefs.

Chief Zheng, recognizing his son in this state, rushed to intervene. “Xiao Zhi! What’s happened to you?”

But when Xiao Zhi’s crimson eyes locked onto him, all recognition vanished. The beastified Xiao Zhi lunged at his father with clawed hands.

Without hesitation, Chief Zheng struck his son’s face, snarling, “You beast!” He then mercilessly slammed his palm infused with spiritual energy into Xiao Zhi’s chest.

Xiao Zhi vomited black blood and crashed into a flowerbed five meters away, collapsing unconscious. The brutality of Chief Zheng’s blows left no room for doubt.

Chief Xiang, who had secluded himself in Zuokong Peak since his earlier humiliation, feigned illness whenever summoned by Sect Leader Xuanming. His deepest hatred lay for Guan Yu, whom he conspired with Yan Zhao to eliminate in the desert.

News of Xiao Zhi’s transformation spread rapidly through Yunqing Sect. Upon hearing it, Chief Xiang emerged rejuvenated, his spirits lifted.

“Wenming, explain everything you witnessed,” Chief Xiang demanded.

“Master, I was present when Xiao Zhi and Yan Zhao exited Tigerhead Hall. Xiao Zhi seemed troubled, then suddenly collapsed writhing before transforming into a black-furred monster with blood-red eyes and fangs.

“Chief Zheng and Sect Leader Xuanming arrived immediately. Without a word, Chief Zheng struck Xiao Zhi unconscious. He’s now imprisoned in Bamboo Peak. Further details remain unclear, so I hurried to report.”

“Black fur?” Chief Xiang’s eyes narrowed. “When A’Cai was killed in the woods, you described similar creatures.”

“Exactly! Though the one that killed A’Cai was larger and more fearsome.”

“Regardless, Xiao Zhi is finished,” Chief Xiang sneered. “Chief Zheng’s heavy-handedness reveals his desperation. Let’s cement this by blaming Xiao Zhi for A’Cai’s murder. He’ll never recover from this.”

In Tigerhead Hall, tension hung thick. Chief Zheng bowed to Xuanming. “Sect Leader, my son has erred grievously. But you know his character—he’d never betray Yunqing Sect. There must be deeper forces at play.”

**Chapter 3787: Pleading for Mercy**

Xuanming’s fury was palpable. “Spare your excuses! The evidence is clear—your son practiced demonic arts! How else do you explain this?”

Chief Zheng’s pleas died as he recognized Xuanming’s implacable nature.

Chief Lu interjected worriedly, “Sect Leader, we’ve watched Xiao Zhi grow. His sudden change after returning from the mission—could there be extenuating circumstances?”

“His bestial transformation was witnessed by all,” Xuanming retorted coldly. “No explanations suffice.”

Chief Lu realized the gravity—colluding with demonic sects warranted execution. Xiao Zhi’s fate seemed sealed.

Chief Xiang entered dramatically with disciple Wenming. “Sect Leader! I heard of this black-furred demon. Is it true?”

Xuanming confirmed grimly, “Chief Zheng’s son transformed publicly. He’s contained now.”

Chief Zheng’s heart sank further as Wenming knelt theatrically. “Sect Leader! When A’Cai died, I witnessed the same black-furred monster—identical to Xiao Zhi’s transformation!”

“Lies!” Chief Zheng roared. “This is slander!”

Xuanming silenced him. “Wenming—you affirm Xiao Zhi killed A’Cai?”

“Without doubt, Sect Leader. The resemblance is exact.”

Chief Xiang added venomously, “Consider Guan Yu’s closeness to Xiao Zhi. He must share culpability!”

Chief Dai countered, “Chief Xiang, your vendetta against Guan Yu clouds your judgment. Until proven, these accusations are baseless.”

“Enough!” Xuanming thundered. “Xiao Zhi will remain imprisoned. Guan Yu shall be summoned for questioning. Chief Xiang—temper your accusations.”

As Xuanming stormed out, Chief Lu approached the despondent Chief Zheng. “I’ll plead your case when he calms.”

Later, in Xuanming’s study, Chief Lu argued, “If Xiao Zhi were truly a spy, why transform publicly? This reeks of demonic sabotage to weaken us!”

Xuanming remained unmoved. “His corruption is evident. We cannot risk further harm.”

“But stripping his cultivation would destroy him! He’s among our finest disciples—grant him a chance to explain!”

“The sect’s safety outweighs any individual,” Xuanming declared. “Demonic taint cannot be tolerated.”

Chief Lu persisted, “The previous black-furred incidents occurred when Xiao Zhi had alibis. How could he evade Elder Jiu’s pursuit if transformed? There must be others!”

Though momentarily swayed, Xuanming concluded, “Public transformation demands severe punishment. Prepare to nullify his cultivation.”

As Chief Lu left to warn Guan Yu, the sect simmered with intrigue—a web of betrayal, vengeance, and the relentless machinery of sect politics grinding forward.
