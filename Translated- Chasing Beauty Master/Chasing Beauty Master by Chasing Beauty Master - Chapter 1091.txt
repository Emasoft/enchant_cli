“Hahaha, alright then! Since Brother Bill is being so courteous, I’ll accept this gift. Thank you again, Brother Bill! If you ever need my help in the future, just say the word, and I, Yuan Shanding (Steadfast Mountain), will rally my men to your aid without fail!” Yuan Shanding chuckled heartily.

As he spoke, he casually picked up the document bag in front of him and handed it to Jiu Buyun (Leek Plutonium Transport) beside him, deliberately weighing it in his hand. He estimated it contained around five hundred thousand—a sum he rarely encountered.

Though they occasionally robbed passing vehicles on the mountain, their usual income was modest. They avoided operating outside their territory to prevent provoking other factions or drawing police attention.

** Mountain and its surrounding areas were practically their domain, where they reigned like local despots. The remote and rugged terrain meant authorities seldom intervened.

Travelers passing through ** Mountain risked encountering Yuan’s bandits, though the robberies were “gentle”—taking only valuables without harming anyone.

Even victims who reported the crimes found little recourse. ** Mountain remained entrenched in feudal traditions, with local officials unwilling to meddle. Mishandling matters could incite riots from nearby villages, so the remote region was largely left to its own devices.

Young men from neighboring villages often joined the mountain bandits, preferring this to farming. In exchange for their service, they received protection and monthly wages.

Years ago, conscription into banditry was forced—young men seized as laborers, women taken to serve the mountain lords. Families suffered, losing their breadwinners without compensation.

Over time, commercialization crept in. Villagers united against kidnappings, making it harder for bandits to recruit. As their numbers dwindled, they resorted to hiring mercenaries for larger heists.

**Chapter 2790: For the Sake of Money**

Now, able-bodied men could voluntarily join the mountain ranks, receiving free lodging and wages to support their families.

The dynamics continued shifting. Banditry gave way to commerce—some mountain lords partnered with businesses or built factories. Others, like Yuan Shanding’s ** Mountain, lagged behind.

Yuan’s income barely covered daily expenses and his men’s wages. But Jiu Buyun, shrewd and resourceful, proposed logging the mountain’s abundant trees. With no authorities to stop them, they began selling timber.

After securing buyers, Yuan ordered his men to fell trees starting from the stronghold’s edges, coinciding with expansion plans. The first profitable batch spurred further logging, temporarily revitalizing their finances.

Yet this was unsustainable. Despite appearances, Yuan hadn’t saved enough to expand the stronghold.

Yuan was delighted by Bill Lin’s lavish “greeting gift.” Jiu Buyun hefted the bag, inwardly marveling at the windfall before even starting the job.

“Thank you for your generosity, Brother Bill. We’re at your service whenever needed,” Jiu Buyun said, clutching the bag.

Bill Lin smiled. “As allies, I provide funds while you contribute labor. Cooperation ensures mutual benefit.”

After hours of discussion, they agreed to coordinate their spies to avoid conflicts during missions.

“Our priority is tracking Guan Yu’s routines and haunts. Only by understanding him can we strike,” Bill Lin asserted.

“We need numerous spies stationed at his frequented spots,” added Poison Widow.

Yuan nodded. “Place skilled agents at key locations like the leather factory. The more eyes, the better.”

“Though manpower-intensive, it’s effective,” Poison Widow conceded.

“I trust Brother Yuan’s elite men can handle this,” Bill Lin said, assigning the task before Yuan could object. Swallowing his irritation, Yuan acquiesced—the money was too good to refuse.

“We’ll follow Brother Bill’s plan,” Jiu Buyun interjected.

Bill continued, “Fifty men should suffice—three to five per location. Discretion is vital, especially at the factory.”

“My men are experts. No worries,” Yuan boasted.

“Indeed, Brother Yuan’s team is exceptional,” Bill flattered, knowing mountain folk thrived on praise.

Suddenly, Feng Shaoye entered the courtyard, startled by the rows of horses. Inside, he eyed the strangers—recognizing only Poison Widow.

“You must be Young Master Feng! A pleasure,” Yuan guessed, recalling Poison Widow’s briefing.

“Correct. This is our host, Feng Shaoye,” Bill said, noting Feng’s unusually early return.

Feng, having lost heavily at Ma Tong’s casino, was in a foul mood. He sneered at Jiu Buyun’s name: “Jiu Buyun (‘Never Pregnant’)? No wonder you’re childless!”

Yuan bristled. “If unwelcome, we’ll leave. But insult us again, and consequences will follow.”

Feng recoiled at Yuan’s aura but pressed on: “Remove those stinking horses! They’re polluting my estate!”

Bill snapped, “We’re here to destroy Guan Yu—for your family’s sake! Or have you forgotten?”

Feng scoffed, “You’re after Guan Yu’s women, not our benefit. Leave if you want!”

**Chapter 2791: Swallowing the Insult**

Bill glared. “Fine! We’ll take our business elsewhere!”

Yuan stood, looming over Feng. “Harm my horses, and you’ll regret it.”

Feng paled but blustered, “Just get them out!”

“Enough!” Bill roared. “Your pettiness jeopardizes everything!”

Feng stormed off as Yuan seethed, gripping his axe. Jiu Buyun calmed him: “Patience. We need this alliance.”

Reluctantly, Yuan nodded. For the money’s sake, he’d endure—for now.

**Chapter 2792: You’re the Problem**

Bill turned to Yuan. “Ignore him. Let’s focus on Guan Yu.”

As they resumed planning, Feng’s voice echoed from the hall: “And clean up that horse dung! This isn’t a barn!”

Yuan’s knuckles whitened around his weapon. Jiu Buyun whispered, “Soon, his arrogance will cost him dearly.”

Bill smirked. Once Guan Yu fell, Feng’s usefulness would end. The real game had just begun.
