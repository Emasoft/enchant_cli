“First Seat Lu said, ‘Earlier, I sent a wisp of spiritual energy into his body to examine him. The internal condition is plagued by high fever, which has now affected the heart region. This situation is exceedingly complex.’”

Guan Yu stepped forward. “I also noticed this earlier, and such a condition is quite uncommon. Elder Martial Uncle Lu, do you have any effective methods to treat him?”

First Seat Lu shook his head. “I am powerless here. For ordinary external injuries or internal injuries caused by external forces, we can assist with spiritual energy. But for this kind of ailment, we have no good solutions. We can only prescribe topical herbal remedies to temporarily sustain him.”

“Ah? So serious?” The aunt exclaimed anxiously. “Then how can we cure my husband’s illness?”

First Seat Dai approached, grasping the uncle’s wrist to re-examine him. Shaking her head, she said, “Elder Martial Brother Lu is correct. His body has already passed the optimal treatment window. He is extremely weak. We have no means to cure him here—only one option remains.”

“What option?” Guan Yu pressed urgently.

First Seat Dai explained, “You are city dwellers. I too have visited cities and studied medicine. In the past, such a person would only await death. But now, if he is rushed to a major city hospital for timely surgical treatment, there is hope for improvement.”

It was unexpected that First Seat Dai understood modern medicine—truly, appearances deceive. She continued, “His condition requires immediate hospital treatment with modern equipment. The longer delayed, the greater the risk to his life and the surgery’s danger.”

The aunt looked imploringly at Guan Yu, who was most familiar with hospitals among them.

**Chapter 3189: Going Together**

“Guan Yu,” Lin Qiaoqiao suggested first, “could you take Uncle for treatment first? After returning, you can resume your…cultivation?”

This wasn’t forbidden, but Guan Yu’s dilemma lay in the lack of nearby cities. Transporting the uncle would require days of arduous travel—questionable given his fragile state.

Guan Yu considered summoning a top-tier city physician via Second Only to Wolf’s resources, but without proper equipment here, the plan was futile.

“Who knows the nearest hospital’s location and travel time?” Guan Yu asked.

First Seat Dai volunteered, “Travel east past a town. On horseback, half a day’s journey beyond lies the nearest major city.”

Guan Yu recognized the mentioned town as Lin Qiaoqiao’s home. “Then we must act immediately. Elder Martial Uncle Lu, Dai, please have disciples escort us to the town. From there, we’ll secure faster transport.”

First Seat Lu agreed, “Human life is paramount. Though night has fallen, depart at once. I’ll explain to the Sect Master. Decide who accompanies you.”

Guan Yu proposed, “Qiaoqiao and Xiao Zhu should remain—”

“No! I’m coming! I worry for Father’s safety!”

“I’m going too! You can’t leave me behind!”

Before Guan Yu finished, both girls vehemently objected. Sighing, Guan Yu conceded, “Elder Martial Uncles, it seems we all go. Please arrange more escorts.”

First Seat Dai declared, “Guan Yu’s friends are Aggregation Peak’s friends. We cannot ignore their plight. Siqi, Xiaochun, and Xiaolian will accompany you. Elder Martial Brother Lu, provide three more disciples.”

As preparations concluded, Guan Yu fetched Second Only to Wolf—awakened from drunken slumber—and chastised him, “Elder Brother, you knew Uncle was gravely ill!”

“A mere fever!” Second Only to Wolf protested. “Aunt said—”

“It’s reached his heart! Without urgent hospital care, he’ll die!”

Shocked, Second Only to Wolf rushed to the sickbed. The uncle lay pallid, fever-flushed, wrapped tightly as disciples prepared a stretcher.

**Chapter 3190: Hunting**

Departing via sword flight, the group carried the uncle on a wheeled bed devised by First Seat Lu. At the village outskirts, Guan Yu noted the demonic World Tree—its strangeness now eclipsed by urgency.

Villagers below kowtowed to passing “immortals,” unaware these were mere cultivators. By midnight, they neared the town’s western edge.

“We descend here,” Guan Yu ordered. “Ma Xiao, thank your disciples. We proceed on foot.”

As escorts departed, Guan Yu instructed Second Only to Wolf: “Hire a motor vehicle at the town’s post station.”

Reluctantly agreeing, Second Only to Wolf sped ahead while the group slowly pushed the jolting stretcher along rugged paths, the uncle’s condition worsening with each bump.

**Chapter 3191: Urgent Matters**

Left guarding four women, Guan Yu reassured Second Only to Wolf: “Siqi will protect us.” The Aggregation Peak disciple nodded solemnly, her master’s matchmaking intentions momentarily forgotten amidst crisis.

Meanwhile at Cloud Azure Sect, First Seat Lu teased First Seat Dai: “You push Siqi toward Guan Yu, yet he’s surrounded by beauties—even Second Only to Wolf’s sister! Will she find happiness?”

Unfazed, First Seat Dai retorted, “Guan Yu’s charm proves his worth. As for Second Only to Wolf—” Her competitive smirk faded as she departed, rivalry undimmed.

The moonlit journey continued, wheels crunching gravel as dawn approached. Survival hung suspended between ancient cultivation arts and modern medicine’s promise.
