Second to Wolf retracted his inner energy and asked indifferently, "What else? Ask whatever you wish. I'll try to satisfy your curiosity." He considered the junior sister already trapped prey. In this situation, escape was impossible. For the sake of her having deceived him twice before, he'd grant her this final chance.

"Explain this," the junior sister demanded. "Earlier you were clearly on East Mountain. How did you detect my trail within mere breaths?"

"I told you - if you're clever, I'm cleverer." Second to Wolf's lips curled. "I never ascended East Mountain. After destroying the cottage, I realized it offered the best escape route. But someone as cunning as you would obviously avoid that path. Uncertain, I remained stationary."

"The commotion on East Mountain was caused by my long-range attack while I spread spiritual awareness to detect you. How careless of you to believe you'd fooled me completely." His voice hardened. "I heard your sighing and muttering. Naturally, I arrived swiftly."

The junior sister nodded grimly. The might of a First-Class Supreme truly terrified her. Though positioned nearly a kilometer from the cottage, his spiritual awareness had still pinpointed her location. She cursed her carelessness - why had she sighed aloud? Spoken to herself? Now her life hung by a thread.

"Wait!" She suddenly straightened. "If you launched that attack from your stationary position, I should have seen the technique's trajectory!"

"Amateur." Second to Wolf chuckled darkly. "Normally, even long-range techniques require visible travel time, especially noticeable at night. Mine traveled underground. You witnessed only the resulting light flashes and falling trees. The valley's echoes further obscured the source."

Pride colored his tone. This arrogant man finally felt he'd regained face after being outwitted twice before.

Understanding dawned on the junior sister. The rumbling she'd heard wasn't from powerful techniques, but vibrations through earth. Before she could speak, Second to Wolf coldly asked, "Any final questions before death?"

"Humph!" The junior sister suddenly laughed mockingly. "You think you can still kill me?"

"Danger!" Crimson light flashed as Second to Wolf's warblade cleaved through a dozen clones. All dissipated like mist - not a single true body remained. During their conversation, the junior sister had already fled, her wounded true body concealed while clones bought time.

Shame burned through Second to Wolf. Enraged, he pulverized the remaining clones and unleashed spiritual awareness to track her escape.

Meanwhile, the injured junior sister fled desperately. Her speed couldn't match a First-Class Supreme's pursuit. Suddenly, Second to Wolf's voice echoed in her ears: "You can't hide the blood trail from my blade."

Cornered, the junior sister made her final gambit. Whipping off her leather belt - her true weapon - she blocked the pursuing blade strikes. Metallic clangs rang out as the flexible belt miraculously parried each deadly slash. But leather couldn't withstand repeated impacts against divine steel. With a desperate cry, she channeled black energy through the belt in a final thrust.

Though forcing Second to Wolf to retreat momentarily, the belt finally snapped. Without hesitation, the merciless killer swung his crimson blade. A cold breeze brushed the junior sister's throat before she collapsed, neck severed without bleeding - her life essence instantly frozen.

By noon next day, news reached Guan Yu. Surprisingly, Elder Qing showed little grief upon learning of his disciple's death - only cold disappointment at her betrayal in hiring a First-Class Supreme against them. When Madam Qing arrived with Ling'er to visit the recuperating Guan Yu, the changed Qiaoyuan District gates greeted them - massive black steel plates replacing former European-style doors, transforming the estate into a fortress.

As the doorbell chimed, A-Mei checked the monitor to see an middle-aged woman and beautiful girl. Unfamiliar with the visitors, she fetched Xue Jing. Recognizing Ling'er, Xue Jing remotely opened the gates.

Madam Qing marveled at the courtyard's luxury - expensive cars, a four-story villa with floor-to-ceiling glass walls exuding modern elegance. Xue Jing greeted them warmly, though noted Madam Qing's weathered hands and rural attire contrasted sharply with Ling'er's delicate beauty.

Inside, the immaculate white interiors awed the visitors. Even the crystal chandelier sparkled flawlessly. Hesitating to dirty pristine floors, Madam Qing only relaxed after changing into provided slippers. As A-Mei prepared lunch, Xue Jing led them upstairs, mentally chiding other residents for not greeting guests properly - Guan Yu valued etiquette towards elders greatly.

The contrast between Madam Qing's humble origins and her daughter's cultivated grace struck Xue Jing anew. Such kindness from Guan Yu towards this family suddenly made perfect sense - some souls naturally commanded compassion.
