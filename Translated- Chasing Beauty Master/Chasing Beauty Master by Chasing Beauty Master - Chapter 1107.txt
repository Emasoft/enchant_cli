“Patriarch Feng observed the chatting group with relief—these unfamiliar faces meant no obligatory greetings. Only now did he notice the stratified patient gowns: fourth-floor residents wore noticeably superior attire compared to his third-floor garb.

Open doors along the corridor revealed empty rooms through frosted glass panels. No sign of Jiu Biyun. Anxiety gnawed at him—this haphazard search was futile. With forty-odd rooms spanning both wings, methodical checking would attract unwanted attention. Provoking some influential figure might land him back in confinement. Bill Lin had truly handed him a poisoned chalice.

A fourth-floor nurse approached, her eyes immediately noting his sky-blue gown against their cream-white uniforms. “May I assist you?” she offered.

Internally cursing such efficiency, Feng waved her off: “Just stretching my legs.”

“The garden would be more suitable for散步,” she persisted.

“I prefer it here,” Feng snapped. The unflappable nurse retreated with a smile: “Do call if needed.”

Alone again, Feng reconsidered his approach. Random searches were impractical—better to mimic his fifth-floor tactic of direct inquiry. He beckoned the nurse back.

“Actually, I’m seeking a female patient named Jiu Biyun, admitted today.”

“No one by that name here,” she replied. “Perhaps another floor?”

Damn that Guan Yu! Feng seethed inwardly. Where’s he hidden her?

As the nurse departed, Feng turned abruptly—CRASH! A middle-aged woman tumbled dramatically. “Are you blind?!” he blustered, though the impact felt slight. Was this a setup?

“Madam Qu!” The nurse rushed over, helping up the clinic’s long-term resident arranged by Yang Conghan herself.

“My back...” The woman winced, discreetly memorizing Feng’s ID badge. “...just needs rest.”

Elsewhere, strategists Luo Bo and Poison Widow divided tasks: “You take fifth floor’s strict zone. I’ll handle fourth. Steal nurse uniforms if possible.”

“Wait till midnight,” Feng advised. “Fewer eyes then.”

——

Locked in her suite, Madam Qu dialed Guan Yu. “A ‘Patriarch Feng’ from third floor asked about Jiu Biyun!”

Guan Yu froze. Feng inside Yang Clinic? Without Yang family alerting him? Treachery or oversight? “Describe him.”

“Thin, vintage hairstyle, mole below left eye—exactly as you said!”

Cursing Yang family’s ambiguous loyalty, Guan Yu mobilized. Jiu Biyun couldn’t stay—Bill Lin’s faction would kill her to keep Yuan Shanding compliant.

——

By 8 PM, Guan Yu and Xue Jing reached the fourth-floor suite. Jiu Biyun lay pallid, lips cracked. “Water...” she rasped.

“Infection risk,” Xue Jing refused gently.

Guan Yu laid bare the stakes: “Bill Lin wants you dead to control Yuan. We’re moving you.”

As they wheeled her out via clinic staff, a black van waited—Jones’ Freedom Organization transport.

“Since when do you fancy rural aunties?” Jones teased upon seeing their charge.

Xue Jing snorted. “Your imagination’s as vivid as ever.”

Through the tension, Jiu Biyun observed her savior. “You’re not the monster Bill described.”

Guan Yu’s smile held shadows. “Monstrosity depends on perspective.”

The van disappeared into night, leaving Yang Clinic’s political games swirling behind them.
