Guan Yu stood up, squinting at the fifth-floor window where a shadowy figure stood. That must be Du Xiaojuan, right?

The distance was too great to see her face clearly, but the code phrase she'd mentioned over the phone matched perfectly. Watching Guan Yu wave up at her, Du Xiaojuan felt an unexpected lump form in her throat—a bittersweet mix of grievance and joy. Covering her mouth to stifle a laugh, she stretched her arm out the window and waved back.

Half an hour crawled by. Guan Yu remained baffled, still seated below. She'd summoned him here, yet refused to come down. Was she waiting for him to climb up? And why had she insisted on this secret meeting when her phone was unreachable? The whole situation confused him.

As Guan Yu gestured toward Du Xiaojuan's window, debating whether to ascend, she suddenly flung open the pane. A small medicine bottle containing a note plummeted downward.

Snatching the bottle, Guan Yu retreated to a stone table. His eyes widened at the message. So she'd been confined by her family, cut off from contacting him!

"Damned ridiculous," he muttered. He'd never stolen, robbed, or committed crimes. Why forbid their friendship with such severity?

PS: Wu Xie must apologize and explain to brothers.

My father's hospitalized—we've relied on each other since childhood. I care for him daily, leaving midnight hours for writing. As you see, this chapter updates past 3 AM. Bear with me these days. After his discharge, I'll compensate with a week of explosive updates. Circumstances compel this—no blame, please! Gratitude!

**Chapter 149: Elopement**

Though resentful of Du Xiaojuan's family's inexplicable hostility, Guan Yu resolved to rescue the girl from her predicament. Seated on a stone bench, he pondered extraction methods when Niu Le peered at the note.

"That girl—the one who followed you to dinner that day. Your sweetheart?"

"Don't spout nonsense! She's just a senior, a friend." Guan Yu coughed, maintaining decorum.

Niu Le smirked skeptically. Though slow-witted, he wasn't blind to the obvious.

As Guan Yu considered scaling the walls using gravity manipulation, an astonishing sight unfolded. Bed sheets knotted into ropes began descending from the window.

"Holy—real-life prison break?" Guan Yu choked back laughter, gaping at Du Xiaojuan's tense face peering down. Five stories was dangerously high—far riskier than her previous third-floor escapade. He gestured frantically for retreat, but she abruptly shut the window and curtains.

Bewildered, Guan Yu stared upward as Du Xiaojuan leapt onto her bed, clutching a plush bear while glaring at her entering mother and aunt.

"Xiaojuan," her mother began gently, "that Guan Yu is trouble. You must cease contact."

To their shock, Du Xiaojuan retorted coldly, "I decide my own affairs!"

"What?" Her mother nearly choked. When had her obedient daughter become this defiant?

"Your father arrives soon to take you back to Beijing. You'll thank us later."

Du Xiaojuan nodded impassively. Seizing this false compliance, her mother pressed closer with reassurances.

"Leave me alone!"

"Eat something?"

"I'll eat later. Go." Her eyelids drooped lazily, but sorrow glimmered beneath.

Alone, Du Xiaojuan locked her door, scribbled a farewell note, then climbed the windowsill with her bear. The dizzying height terrified her, yet resolve hardened her grip on the sheets.

"Madness!" Guan Yu's heart raced as she inched downward, nearly kicking through neighbors' windows. He positioned himself beneath, breath held, until her fluffy rabbit slippers touched grass.

"Freedom!" She threw herself into his arms, cheeks flushed. "Hug me, junior!"

Niu Le snorted amusement at their embrace—clear evidence against Guan Yu's "just friends" claim.

**Chapter 150: Mutual Reliance**

Noticing Niu Le, Du Xiaojuan blinked in recognition—the axe-wielding brute from before?

"Let's move," Guan Yu urged, eyeing her slippers. They fled through the compound, a taxi whisking them to a budget hotel.

Revelations unfolded: Du Xiaojuan's parents had discovered her near-abduction and demanded relocation. Her rebellion stemmed from Guan Yu—deemed a delinquent influence.

"Junior..." She blinked pitifully. "I've no wallet or ID. Don't abandon me!"

Guan Yu chuckled—this "burden" felt unexpectedly warm. "We've all dropped out. Our new life begins now."

Du Xiaojuan's eyes lit up. No more loneliness! Their trio would rely on each other.

"Expenses..." she worried.

"Tomorrow we hustle for cash," Guan Yu declared. His hidden funds aside, his supernatural abilities promised unconventional income.

**Chapter 151: This Won't Do**

Late-night drinks ensued. Niu Le kept plying Du Xiaojuan until she grew tipsy, slurring against Guan Yu.

As Niu Le departed, he winked suggestively. "Cherish the nuptial night..."

Guan Yu rolled his eyes but smiled. Watching the sleeping girl, tenderness overwhelmed him—this rare vulnerability he'd never show others.
