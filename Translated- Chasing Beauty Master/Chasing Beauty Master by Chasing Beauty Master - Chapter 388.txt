Li Xi had taken the initiative to invite him shopping—a first in history. If he refused now, who knew when the next chance would come? Yet his rightful wife was currently on a blind date with another man. If he didn't hurry over, his wife might get stolen!

For the first time, Guan Yu faced a dilemma. *Does this count as joy turning to sorrow?*

"Why don't we go tomorrow instead?" he suggested.

"No. I want to watch a movie now," Li Xi replied coolly.

"But I've got urgent business! Tomorrow, I'll do anything you want. Today's impossible—I need to leave. Lin Dong will stay here to protect you. See you later!"

With that, Guan Yu strode out. After all, Wen Qing was his lawfully wedded wife, whereas things with Li Xi remained uncertain. Naturally, Wen Qing took priority.

Watching him depart, Li Xi's eyes clouded with disappointment.

......

Guan Yu soon arrived at the Wen residence. When he knocked, Wen Qing's mother Liu Yunshu opened the door. "Guan Yu? What brings you here?" she asked in surprise.

*If I hadn't come, my wife would've been snatched away!* Guan Yu fumed inwardly, though his smile remained polite. "Auntie, I'm here to see Wen Qing."

"Oh, come in."

Liu Yunshu ushered him inside. The moment Guan Yu entered, his eyes locked onto a young man about his age sitting on the sofa.

The stranger possessed striking features—far more handsome than Guan Yu—dressed in an immaculate suit exuding refined elegance.

*Pretty face doesn't mean he's not a wolf in sheep's clothing!* Guan Yu thought resentfully. He instinctively disliked men better-looking than himself, especially when they came sniffing around his woman. That he hadn't punched this guy already showed remarkable restraint.

Old Master Wen Quanshu chuckled upon seeing him. "Guan Yu! Come sit here." He patted the space beside him.

Wen Baoguo, however, snorted darkly from across the room.

*Should've let that ungrateful bastard stay sick!* Guan Yu cursed mentally, though his face remained neutral as he took the offered seat.

"Let me introduce Hu Zongze—a returnee from overseas studies. Zongze, this is Xiao Jing's boyfriend, Guan Yu."

Hu Zongze's expression flickered before smoothing into a polite smile. "Pleasure," he said, extending his hand.

Guan Yu shook it perfunctorily. "So you're the 'Zongze gege' who grew up with Xiao Jing?"

"Childhood playmates, nothing more," Hu Zongze demurred with a faint smile.

Noting the patriarch's favoritism, Wen Baoguo interjected: "Zongze, our families have been close since before you were born. When our wives were pregnant, I jokingly suggested arranging a betrothal while still in the womb!"

Hu Zongze chuckled. "Father often mentions that. He keeps urging me to pursue Xiao Jing." He addressed Wen Baoguo exclusively, pointedly ignoring Guan Yu.

*These two bastards!* Guan Yu seethed. The patriarch had clearly declared him Wen Jing's boyfriend, yet they kept harping about arranged marriages? This blatant disrespect...

"Hmph! If you won't recognize me as son-in-law, don't expect me to spare your face!" Guan Yu sneered. "Betrothal in the womb? Who follows such feudal superstitions nowadays? That nonsense gets people killed!"

Chapter 972: Touch My Wife and I'll Chop Off Your Hand

Wen Baoguo nearly choked on his water, while Old Master Wen laughed heartily. "Exactly! We advocate free love now."

"See, Grandpa? Though advanced in years, your thinking stays youthful—and your health puts younger men to shame!" Guan Yu's barbed compliment clearly targeted Wen Baoguo.

The minister snorted. "Don't think curing me obliges gratitude—"

"Should I thank you for letting me treat you instead?" Guan Yu's retort left Wen Baoguo speechless. Even a State Security Minister couldn't demand gratitude from his savior.

Wen Qing chose that moment to emerge, rushing over to cling to Guan Yu's arm. "I thought you weren't coming!"

"Of course I came! As the saying goes: 'Obey your wife and follow the Party.' You're my wife—how could I disobey?" Guan Yu blatantly ignored Wen Baoguo's glare, bantering with Wen Qing.

Hu Zongze's eyes flashed with venom at their intimacy. The entire Beijing elite circle knew he'd staked claim on Wen Qing since childhood. Though she'd only ever seen him as an elder brother, he'd comforted himself that she'd mature in time. Now this nobody had stolen his prize, flaunting their relationship with saccharine endearments. The injustice burned.

Yet he maintained composure. *She's just rebelling. Once bored of this peasant, she'll return. The Wens value social standing—look how Uncle Wen dislikes him!*

Suppressing his rage, Hu Zongze proposed: "Xiao Qing, my family's hosting a ball soon. Would you be my dance partner?"

"Zongze gege..." Wen Qing began refusing, but Guan Yu cut in: "Sure! But while she's your partner, her escort will be me. You don't mind me joining, right?"

"Guan Yu! This is a private family event," Wen Baoguo frowned.

"Baoguo!" the patriarch chided. "As Xiao Qing's boyfriend, shouldn't he accompany her?"

The father-son pair stood divided—patriarch backing Guan Yu, minister favoring Hu Zongze.

"Dad! Letting outsiders into the Hu family ball—"

"Outsider? Guan Yu's my grandson-in-law!"

Their staring contest ended with Wen Baoguo yielding. "Then let Zongze decide!"

Hu Zongze's smile tightened. Refusal would insult the patriarch. "Of course... welcome, Mr. Guan. Though I regret losing Xiao Qing as partner."

"Zongze gege, I'm sorry."

"Never mind." Hu Zongze waved magnanimously. "But you'll dance with me, yes?"

"Of course! Unless I step on your feet..."

"I'd never scold you," Hu Zongze gazed tenderly.

Guan Yu's jealousy ignited. "Listen well—if your hands wander during that dance, I'll chop them off!"

"Dancing requires contact. Would you maim me for that?" Hu Zongze's calm masked fury. None dared threaten him—were this not the Wen home, Guan Yu's hands would already be severed.

"Who says dancing needs hands? Breakdancing? Folk dance?" Guan Yu retorted. His wife's body was his alone. That this pretty boy dared covet her... restraint deserved medals.

The absurdity made even Wen Qing stifle laughter. Ballroom breakdancing? Yet Guan Yu's provincialism reassured Hu Zongze—no threat here.

"Mr. Guan's... amusing."

"Thanks!" Guan Yu embraced the sarcasm.

"Such pettiness." Wen Baoguo sneered. "Can't imagine what Xiao Qing sees in you."

Wen Qing fired back: "Mom still married you despite your jealousy! Remember when her ex visited? You nearly flipped the table!"

Guan Yu's ears perked up. "Do tell!"

Thus Wen Qing exposed her father's past: "That was Mom's first love..."

Chapter 973: Red Wine vs. Glucose

As Wen Qing chattered, the group learned how Minister Wen had once raged over his wife's reunited ex—a story making Guan Yu nod sagely: "Insecurity breeds jealousy."

"Who's insecure?!" Wen Baoguo roared, mustache quivering. Only the patriarch's warning glare stopped him from lunging.

"The petty one knows himself," Guan Yu taunted. "A minister acting childish—how shameful!"

"I forbid your marriage!" Wen Baoguo thundered.

"Disregard him," the patriarch countered. "You have my blessing."

"You're the best, Grandpa!" Wen Qing kissed the old man's cheek. Guan Yu felt moved—this staunch support dwarfed her father's hostility.

"I'm her father! I decide!" Wen Baoguo protested.

"I'm yours! Want your legs broken?!" The patriarch's roar silenced him. Even a State Security Minister dared not cross his battle-hardened father.

Defeated, Wen Baoguo turned to Hu Zongze: "Let's dine. Drink with me tonight."

At the table, Wen Baoguo seated Hu Zongze beside Wen Qing. Guan Yu itched to smash rice into the minister's face—making his wife entertain this rival? For saving his life?!

Wen Qing however stuck to Guan Yu's side, while her mother sat between her and Hu Zongze.

"Uncle Wen, this authentic '82 Lafite—unlike counterfeits—comes from a renowned collector. Please try it." Hu Zongze poured for both Wens and Guan Yu, maintaining decorum.

"Superb bouquet," Wen Baoguo praised after sipping.

Guan Yu downed his glass in one gulp. "Tastes like hospital glucose. Why's this swill so expensive?"

Hu Zogze's smile turned condescending. "Lafite's '82 vintage used exceptionally ripe grapes—"

"Grandpa dislikes this too?" Guan Yu interrupted. "Want something else?"

"Sure. What?"
