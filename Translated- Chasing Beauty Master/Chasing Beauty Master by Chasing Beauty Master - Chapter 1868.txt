The carriage of the Princess Royal raced unimpeded into the imperial palace. Upon learning the Emperor was convening in the Imperial Study, she clutched her skirts and hurried forward without awaiting summons. Her coachman sprinted ahead holding a golden token, clearing their path until they reached the study's outer gates.

This token was no ordinary pass – it bore the Emperor's personal prohibition decree, the only one of its kind in the realm. Its presence commanded the same reverence as the Emperor himself, requiring all who saw it to kneel and hail "Long live His Majesty." It granted unrestricted access throughout the capital, even within palace walls.

Bestowed decades earlier during the Princess Royal's youth, this token had never been used until now. Though protocol forbade coachmen from entering inner palace grounds, desperate circumstances compelled its use for swift passage.

At the study's entrance, two blade-bearing guards hesitated upon seeing the Princess Royal's approach but ultimately knelt in obeisance. Their cries of allegiance echoed into the chamber, startling the Emperor and his council of princes and ministers.

"Yu Kong! Investigate this commotion at once!" the Emperor barked, brows furrowed. "Who dares cause disturbance here?"

The aged eunuch had scarcely taken three steps when the doors burst open. Gasps filled the room as the Princess Royal stormed in, snatching the token from her coachman. Without ceremony, she threw herself prostrate before the throne, her forehead striking the marble with a resounding crack. Even the Emperor started at this unprecedented breach of protocol.

As the Emperor's most cherished daughter, the Princess Royal had always enjoyed exceptional privileges. Her current disheveled appearance – hair escaping its pins, robes in disarray – shocked the assembly. Normally entitled to mere nods of greeting (a privilege reserved for empresses), her dramatic prostration signaled dire circumstances.

"Imperial Father! Forgive this offense!" she cried. "Xin'er may have been abducted!"

The chamber stilled. The Emperor's fist slammed the armrest, jade rings clattering. "Repeat that!"

As tension thickened, Grand Prince and Prince Zou exchanged glances. Their earlier discussion about flood relief in North River Province now seemed trivial compared to this crisis.

Jiang Xin, the missing郡主 (lord's daughter), held special status. Though not the Emperor's blood descendant, her gift for delighting the imperial court had earned affection rivaling that shown to the Princess Royal herself.

Eunuch Yu Kong maintained composure. "Your Highness, please rise and explain calmly. What befell the Young Mistress?"

"At dawn, Xin'er took two maids on an outing," the Princess Royal recounted, voice trembling. "By noon, all three vanished. My household guards scoured the capital without trace! Father, you must help!"

The Emperor's jowls quivered with rage. "Yu Kong! Mobilize the Golden Banner troops! Tear the capital apart if needed! Swiftly!"

Before the eunuch could bow, Prince Zou interjected: "Sire, we must seal the city gates immediately. Let no suspicious element escape."

"Grand Prince!" the Emperor commanded. "Take five thousand imperial guards. Lock down all gates – not a sparrow flies out! You'll wear the Yellow Riding Jacket (a symbol of imperial authority)."

As the prince departed, the Princess Royal grasped his sleeve. "Brother, I entrust Xin'er to you."

Prince Zou observed these developments thoughtfully. Deploying the Emperor's personal guard for city lockdowns marked unprecedented measures, underscoring Jiang Xin's importance. Even the Empress herself couldn't breach such a seal.

When dismissed ministers left, Prince Zou lingered. "Might I inquire, Your Highness – who would dare target the驸马 (imperial son-in-law)'s household?"

The Emperor stormed down from his dais. "Exactly! Who in this capital possesses such audacity?"

The Princess Royal wrung her hands. "Recently, a man named Wan Hong gifted Xin'er the East Sea Dragon Pearl at auction. Whispers claim it holds nation-rivaling treasure. As my husband investigates these rumors... this happens."

"Those peasant-bandits!" the Emperor roared. "When caught, they'll suffer dismemberment and clan extermination!"

Prince Zou stroked his beard. "Desperate men risk all for such wealth. Take heart – the kidnappers likely want the pearl, not the girl's life. She's their bargaining chip."

Though somewhat reassured, the Princess Royal fretted: "Xin'er's never endured hardship! What if..."

"Enough recriminations!" the Emperor cut in. "Your husband's pursuit wasn't misguided – we simply underestimated criminal daring."

As discussion continued, Prince Zou's mind raced. The imperial guards' current commander answered to Second Prince's faction. Dispatching them under Grand Prince's command might spark political ripples. Could this crisis benefit Grand Prince's standing if resolved successfully?

When guards were dispatched to fortify the驸马's estate, Prince Zou noted another power play. The Emperor's anxiety overrode usual political balancing acts.

"Imperial Uncle," the Princess Royal addressed Prince Zou (honorary title for saving the Emperor's life), "who in the capital would attempt this?"

"Four Great Families crave the treasure but know their limits," Prince Zou analyzed. "More likely, newly-arrived Jianghu ruffians – desperate souls who'd challenge heaven itself for wealth."

The Emperor nodded. "Those clans understand their existence hangs on our tolerance. Only rootless wanderers would attempt this."

As fresh panic gripped the Princess Royal, Prince Zou reassured: "The pearl is their true target. The Young Mistress remains safe as collateral."

When the Emperor ordered additional guards to surround the驸马's mansion, Prince Zou pondered deeper implications. With Grand Prince controlling city exits and Second Prince's ally commanding interior forces, this crisis might reshape court dynamics.

Beneath his calm exterior, Prince Zou's mind churned. His arduous journey from distant Liao City – surviving bandit ambushes and losing loyal retainers – had steeled his resolve. This crisis presented opportunities. If Grand Prince rescued Jiang Xin, imperial favor might shift. Yet if Second Prince's faction proved involved...

The chessboard was set. As night deepened over the sealed capital, thousands of guards began their search. Somewhere in the labyrinthine city, a priceless hostage awaited discovery, her fate entangled with imperial politics and legendary treasure.
