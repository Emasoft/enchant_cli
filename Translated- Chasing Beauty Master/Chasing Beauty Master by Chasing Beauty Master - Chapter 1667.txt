“Big! Big…” The woman was gambling on the dice game, clearly betting on "big" as she kept shrieking in an ear-piercing voice.

Yet the atmosphere proved irresistible. Lin Chen contemplated – since there was no immediate chance to inform the group, he might as well observe the commotion. He wouldn’t gamble himself, merely watch.

Ling Su had already slipped inside earlier. The familiar sights stirred his excitement, though his purse held limited silver. Seizing the opportunity before Lin Chen alerted the others, he decided to gamble a few rounds for profit.

Lin Chen squeezed beside the shrill-voiced woman just as the dealer revealed the dice: four, five, six – undeniably "big."

“Hahaha! Pay up! I told you it’d be big!” The woman’s laughter pierced through the clamor.

Lin Chen observed her sizable pile of winnings. Others watched enviously, their losses evident. This woman clearly possessed skill. As the dealer shook the dice cup again, its contents clattering, he chanted: “Place your bets!”

Few gambled initially. Most awaited the woman’s move, planning to mirror her wager given her streak of luck.

“Still ‘big’! I’m betting heavy!” She tossed five silver ingots. A frenzy followed as the crowd piled their stakes on "big," leaving "small" nearly deserted.

**Chapter 4359: Not Enough**

“Follow me and prosper!” the woman crowed. The dice revealed three, six, six – another "big." Cheers erupted, though her haul dwarfed others’. Lin Chen marveled, suspecting trickery beneath her luck.

Reasoning that losses would be collective if she faltered, Lin Chen decided to join the next round. As the dice rattled again, he leaned toward her: “What’s your call this time, beauty?” The address was flattery – she was plain, thin as a rail, nearing forty – yet she preened at the compliment.

After deliberate hesitation, she declared: “Small this round. Follow me?”

“Done.” Lin Chen placed his ingot on "small." The dealer unveiled one, three, four – "small." Universal cheers erupted as the house suffered losses, the dealer’s face twisting in frustration.

“Hah! Should’ve bet heavier!” The woman’s glee overflowed despite self-reproach. Lin Chen pocketed his first win, astonished at his sudden fortune. Back at Cloud Azure Sect, he’d lost nine of ten bets, often resorting to bluffs or welching.

This windfall solved his dilemma: Guan Yu’s limited funds had forced careful budgeting for twenty-odd companions. Now he could splurge on gifts for Siqi – jade bracelets, rouge – to earn her favor.

The woman’s growing silver hoard attracted disciples. She now occupied the prime seat opposite the dealer, listening intensely to the shaking dice. When she finally cried “Small again!”, half her fortune hit the table – nearly a hundred taels.

Lin Chen, envisioning gifts and perhaps a visit to the brothel across the street, staked half his purse on "small."

“Well now, plump fellow!” The woman eyed his wager. “Didn’t take you for deep pockets!”

“Merely discreet wealth,” Lin Chen boasted. Others followed suit, some staking entire purses.

“Small! Small! SMALL!” Her screech near-deafened Lin Chen as the dealer painstakingly lifted the cup. A two showed first, then another – two twos! Lin Chen’s grin widened. Even a six would total ten – still "small." Visions of luxury danced before him: lavish gifts, a superior room for Siqi, bragging rights over Guan Yu…

**Chapter 4360: No Trouble Here**

“Hah! Today’s fortune!” Lin Chen’s decorum shattered as he guffawed – until the third die showed another two. Triple twos – a “leopard roll” – meant house victory.

“IMPOSSIBLE!” the woman wailed as the dealer raked in silver with a wooden scoop. Lin Chen’s heart constricted. Many had bet entire stakes, now left penniless.

“Damned cheats!” A fortyish man roared. Others cursed, but none dared violence – the establishment’s enforcers discouraged trouble.

An elderly loser muttered about borrowing more silver. “Go home!” the woman advised.

“Home?” The old man scoffed. “Empty pockets mean hunger. I’ll borrow – silver means chances!” He disappeared into a side room – the loan office.

The dealer explained: “No collateral needed. Low interest – twenty taels borrows at one tael monthly.”

As the woman won again without Lin Chen’s involvement, bitterness gnawed him. Half his funds gone – no gifts for Siqi, camel purchases jeopardized.

“Leave if you’ve no nerve!” the woman snapped. “Your stink brought that leopard roll!”

Lin Chen stayed, determined to recover losses. The old man returned with borrowed silver, extolling easy credit. Others followed to the loan office.

**Chapter 4361: No Rush**

“What if you lose again?” someone challenged the borrower.

“Bad omen!” The old man scowled. “Their terms are fair – twenty taels for one tael interest monthly. Repay anytime within thirty days.”

As the dealer called new bets, Lin Chen hesitated. The woman’s latest win mocked his absence. Borrowing tempted him – low interest, instant capital. Yet caution whispered: his presence seemed to curse the table.

The dice landed five, five, six – "big." The woman crowed again. Lin Chen’s fingers twitched toward his remaining silver. Across the room, the loan office door stood ajar, promising resurrection of fortune...
