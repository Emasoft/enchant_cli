However, it seemed the colossal dragon hadn't noticed her. With a resounding roar that reverberated across the magma lake, the very lava churned violently beneath its cry. --3617+697260-->

Chapter 1572: Volcano

Guanyu instinctively covered her ears. Though not as potent as the vampire bat's sonic attacks, this roar still assaulted her senses while her powers remained depleted.

Outside the volcano, a small group watched the fiery peak with mounting excitement. "Young City Lord! There!" A plain-looking middle-aged man pointed fervently. "Let's move!" The white-robed youth atop a black stallion spurred forward eagerly. After days of fruitless searching, this dragon's roar finally revealed their quarry's location!

Observing the lingering dragon, Guanyu worried about escape routes. Settling against the cavern wall to recuperate, she suddenly saw the beast soar skyward. "Finally leaving!" She leapt up, only to notice magma rising alarmingly fast around her perch. "Is the volcano erupting? Unbelievable luck!"

Her eyes then caught a crimson lotus blossoming at the magma's heart. "That's... a fourth-grade Fire Lotus!" Hu Xiaohai's voice trembled with awe. "Four grades can heal any external wound! This specimen might even evolve into a seventh-grade Blood Lotus!" Now understanding why the dragon guarded this place, Guanyu's gaze sharpened.

"Harvest it!" Hu Xiaohai urged. "It can mend your facial scars!" Guanyu smirked beneath her mask. "Unnecessary. Have you forgotten my light magic?" As magma licked her boots, she summoned wind elements to levitate upwards. "Still, I'll claim this treasure."

Outside the crater, the white-robed youth's group froze at another dragon's roar. "Saint Sovereign beast! Uncle Rong, retreat with the others!" The leader ordered despite his men's protests. Flaming wrath descended as the dragon attacked its would-be plunderers.

Meanwhile, Guanyu narrowly dodged falling fireballs while scaling the shaft. "Who dares attack below?!" She cursed, redoubling her climb. At Hu Xiaohai's mental alert of the lotus' full bloom, she lashed her whip to snatch the glowing blossom. "Superb quality."

Both dragon and youth detected the lotus' fragrance. The beast rejoiced at impending healing while the human leader despaired against overwhelming odds. Their stalemate shattered when a crimson blur erupted from the volcano - a red-clad girl with masked features landing between them.

"Child, flee!" the youth shouted, though visibly drained. Guanyu's retort died as dragonfire engulfed them. To her astonishment, the youth shielded her with his last energies. When the flames cleared, she vanished - only to reappear kicking the dragon's snout with preternatural speed. "Cease your flames!"

As the volcano trembled, Guanyu tossed the lotus to the youth. "Go!" Dragging him through the erupting chaos, they barely escaped the pyroclastic fury.

Chapter 1573: Uninvited Guest

Outside, the rescue party panicked until spotting their leader's return with mysterious company. "This is Xiuluo, my savior," the youth introduced. Suspicion colored his men's eyes, especially swordsman Jian Nan's. "A brat defeating a Saint Sovereign beast? Impossible!"

Guanyu's murderous aura flared when challenged, halted only by the leader's intervention. "I'm Mu Bai. Join us - the Endless Desert is perilous alone." After calculating the benefits of guides, the masked girl nodded.

As night fell, Guanyu's abrupt warning of approaching demon wolves drew skepticism. When the pack materialized, Mu Bai's group witnessed her lone slaughter dance - a whirlwind of crimson and black steel reducing beasts to gory fragments. The sole survivor cowered before her Soul-Devouring Whip's hungry gleam.

"Xiuluo needs no protection," Mu Bai stated gravely, watching his men's prejudice dissolve into awe. Veteran Rong Shi frowned at her lingering bloodlust. "That child... she's drenched in slaughter."

Chapter 1574: Mu Bai

Dawn found the caravan weary yet watchful. While others rested, Rong Shi maintained vigil. Guanyu's sudden alertness preceded another wolf assault - this time met with unified readiness. When the beasts inexplicably fled, the group followed to discover their scarlet-clad scout standing victorious amidst carnage.

"Devil..." the last wolf whimpered before meeting its end. Guanyu coldly wiped her whip as the others arrived. Mu Bai's admiration warred with concern. This enigmatic ally radiated lethal grace far beyond her apparent years, her masked face revealing nothing. Yet when their eyes met, he glimpsed something startlingly familiar - the same reluctant nobility he'd seen in his cousin Murong Fengyu.

As they pressed onward through the burning wastes, Guanyu pondered her choices. These humans' destination might yet align with her path to the Underworld. For now, she'd tolerate their company... and their fragile lives' fleeting warmth.
