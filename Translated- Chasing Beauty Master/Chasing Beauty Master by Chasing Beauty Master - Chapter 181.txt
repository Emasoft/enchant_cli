Guan Yu smiled gently at the young mother and said, “He’s likely been drugged unconscious, but otherwise unharmed. I can’t lift him myself. Would you mind carrying him?”

The woman gave him a grateful glance and nodded. Cradling the little boy carefully in her arms, she rocked him urgently. “Zihao, wake up! Don’t scare Mommy like this!”

The child’s hand twitched. Rubbing bleary eyes, he blinked awake and piped, “Mommy, why are you crying?”

“Oh Zihao, thank heavens you’re alright!” The woman pressed her tear-streaked face against his, holding him tightly.

The boy reached up with tiny fingers to wipe her tears. “Don’t cry, Mommy. I was good! I was just playing with Uncle Mickey earlier.”

Lying on the ground nearby, Guan Yu turned his head to witness this tender scene and smiled warmly.

Tian Xun approached and crouched beside him. “You alright?”

“You...smiled?” Guan Yu stared as if witnessing a miracle. The Tian Xun he knew was perpetually stone-faced.

“I’ve always admired men of both courage and wit,” Tian Xun explained.

“Uh...” Guan Yu felt oddly discomfited.

Examining Guan Yu’s limp arms, Tian Xun asked, “Can you stand?”

“Not likely,” Guan Yu grimaced. His shoulders weren’t just dislocated – severe bone fractures radiated pain through his body. The healing system had stabilized the damage, but full recovery would require multiple electric treatments.

With Tian Xun’s assistance, Guan Yu struggled upright. The young mother approached, still holding her son. “Thank you. When my husband arrives, we’ll take you to the hospital.”

Guan Yu’s arms hung uselessly at his sides. “No need for hospitals. I have matters to attend to.”

“Please,” she insisted. “My husband can arrange the best medical care—”

He shook his head firmly. No hospital could match his healing system’s capabilities.

As Guan Yu turned to leave, the crowd stirred again. A gleaming Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith purred to a halt nearby. The chauffeur opened the rear door, revealing polished Italian crocodile loafers before a distinguished man in his forties emerged.

The man’s commanding presence silenced the crowd. His gaze swept over them as he approached his wife. “Xinyu, what happened?”

Wang Xinyu’s eyes reddened as she recounted the incident. “Yuan Sheng, Zihao nearly died today!”

Gu Yuansheng’s brow furrowed dangerously. “My oversight. This won’t happen again.”

Turning to Guan Yu, he said, “I’m Gu Yuansheng. You saved my son. Let my car take you for treatment.”

“Really unnecessary—” Guan Yu began.

“Can you even move those arms?” Gu Yuansheng countered bluntly.

Guan Yu grimaced – without functional hands, he couldn’t recharge his healing system. “...Alright.”

As the Silver Wraith departed, Tian Xun melted into the crowd. Bystanders gaped in awe. “That was Gu Yuansheng! I stood three meters from the tycoon himself!”

Inside the car, Guan Yu made an odd request: “Any chocolate or candy?”

Gu Yuansheng raised an eyebrow but produced confections meant for his son. Wang Xinyu fed Guan Yu piece after piece until the entire stash disappeared.

“Apologies,” Guan Yu flushed. “I’ll replace them.”

Wang Xinyu laughed. “We’ll buy more. You clearly enjoyed them.”

When Guan Yu mentioned contacting a friend, Gu Yuansheng retrieved his phone. The device’s unusual design drew a curious glance.

“Li Xi?” came the icy voice through the receiver.

“I’m going to Yü Sheng Sanatorium,” Guan Yu explained before the line went dead.

The “hospital room” they entered resembled a presidential suite. Physicians examined Guan Yu’s injuries. “One week for the fractures to mend,” they declared.

Gu Yuansheng dismissed them. “This sanatorium is mine. Stay as long as needed.”

Their conversation was interrupted by urgent news: Gu Yuansheng’s father had crashed. In the critical care unit, monitors flatlined as doctors argued over treatment.

“False death,” Guan Yu announced from the doorway. “I can revive him.”

Under skeptical gazes, Guan Yu placed trembling hands on the old man’s chest. Beads of sweat formed as mystical energy flowed through his palms. Suddenly – a heartbeat flickered on the monitor.

“Impossible!” gasped the lead physician as vital signs returned.

Gu Yuansheng gripped Guan Yu’s shoulder. “You’ve saved my family twice today.”

Guan Yu smiled weakly. “Just...need more chocolate.”
