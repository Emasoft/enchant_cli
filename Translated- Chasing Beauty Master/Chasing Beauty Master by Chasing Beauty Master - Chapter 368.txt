“And that villa he was heading to—given his current means—was absolutely beyond his purchasing power! This villa had been specially arranged by his clandestine lover for their secret rendezvous.

Chen Lin’s lover was a still-charming young matron in her thirties, an alumnus from his university days. Though the two had once shared intricate connections, their life paths had diverged worlds apart.

She had become the wife of a high-ranking official in the capital, basking in luxury, while Chen Lin himself remained mediocre and unaccomplished.

This state of affairs underwent an earth-shaking transformation during an accidental reunion where passion’s sparks ignited.

It was she—Chen Lin’s lover—who revolutionized his circumstances, funding his overseas education and devoting herself entirely to his rise.

Naturally, her investments bore fruit.

Chen Lin lived up to expectations, returning triumphantly as a leading expert in his field, welcomed by enthusiastic receptions. Their illicit affair consequently grew more fervent and brazen, their trysts frequent.

This villa became their regular meeting spot, known to few outsiders.

Today, after swallowing a bellyful of rage from Guan Yu, Chen Lin stormed into the villa in a feverish rush, dispensing with formalities and getting straight to business.

Faintly, one could hear a woman’s moans interspersed with bestial male roars.

Chen Lin, as if exorcizing inner demons, abandoned all former tenderness, transforming into a beast that ravaged the delicate flesh beneath him, unleashing carnal desires.

Unbeknownst to them, during their carnal entanglement, a camera with infrared capabilities outside their window recorded this illicit scene.

After his release, Chen Lin cradled the blood-stirring, seductive body against him, silently lighting a cigarette as he reclined against the headboard.

Li Jing nestled close, her delicate fingers tracing circles on Chen Lin’s broad chest as she cooed: “Chen Lin, you seemed particularly vigorous today—did something happen?”

Li Jing was the daughter-in-law of a top-tier capital official, her husband a heavyweight political figure. By rights, she should have been a refined, proper lady—yet here she was, betraying her spouse with another man. If exposed, her family’s reputation would be ruined.

“Just minor frustrations—nothing serious.” Chen Lin grasped Li Jing’s ample bosom with one hand while the other probed her depths, reigniting her arousal.

Under his ministrations, Li Jing’s moans crescendoed, becoming irresistible. She adored men like Chen Lin—presentably dignified yet enduringly virile, understanding her inner solitude in ways her husband (who “paid tribute” maybe once monthly) never could.

Once again, the room filled with carnal sights unfit for young eyes.

But as Chen Lin reached climax, he received a package.

This mysterious parcel appeared at their doorstep post-coitus as they prepared for a shower.

“Did you leave this here?” Chen Lin eyed the package warily.

Li Jing shook her head, paling. “It wasn’t here when we entered!”

Realization dawned—their affair was exposed.

Li Jing trembled. “Have we been discovered?”

Chen Lin inhaled sharply. “If your husband knew, soldiers would be here—not packages. But someone knows our secret.”

Li Jing panicked. “What do we do?”

“We open it.” Chen Lin tore open the package to find a videotape—footage of their tryst.

Watching their explicit entanglement, Chen Lin smashed the remote in rage. “Bastard!”

Li Jing discovered writing on the tape: “I told you we’d meet again.”

Chen Lin paled—it was Guan Yu’s doing.

At Teahouse Club, Guan Yu lounged with Li Xi, sipping wine.

“You’re sure he’ll return?” Li Xi asked.

“He’ll come begging,” Guan Yu smirked.

When Chen Lin stormed in, he found Guan Yu and Li Xi in compromising proximity.

“You arrived quite promptly,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Give me the tape. I accept your terms,” Chen Lin growled.

Guan Yu smiled. “Seems I underestimated you—you’ve got some competence after all.”
