After arriving in the town, Second to Wolf found it nearly deserted at around three in the morning. The streets lay silent, making it difficult to locate a courier station, especially since he wasn't familiar with the area.

With no other options, he relied on his memory to find the Lin residence. After knocking persistently on the grand gate, it slowly creaked open. "Is Master Lin at home? I have urgent business requiring his assistance," Second to Wolf addressed the butler who peered at him with vague recognition.

"I... I believe I've seen you before..." the butler muttered uncertainly.

Growing impatient, Second to Wolf exclaimed, "I came here previously with Miss Qiaoqiao and her fiancé Guan Yu! Surely you remember?"

The mention jolted the butler's memory. Though Second to Wolf had mostly remained hidden during his prior visits, the connection became clear. "Ah! Please come in and wait in the main hall. I'll summon the master immediately!"

Before long, Lin Zhonggeng hurried into the hall. "Why have you returned alone? Where are Qiaoqiao and Guan Yu?"

"Master Lin, Miss Qiaoqiao's uncle has fallen gravely ill. They're still en route, but the journey is arduous. I came ahead to request your help in arranging transport to fetch them. His condition requires urgent hospitalization."

"What? How could someone in his prime fall so seriously ill?" Lin Zhonggeng asked, bewildered.

"The details remain unclear. Time is critical—do you have any vehicles available? Even farming transport would suffice."

Lin Zhonggeng nodded briskly. "We have a new agricultural tricycle in the rear courtyard. I'll have the steward dispatch it immediately."

"Let me accompany them," Second to Wolf insisted. "We must take shortcuts to reach the nearest city hospital directly."

As the diesel engine's roar echoed through dawn-lit mountains, Guan Yu's group pushing a wheeled cot paused at the approaching clamor. The deep blue tricycle emerged, carrying Second to Wolf and a driver.

"Let's move him onto the vehicle first!" Guan Yu shouted over the engine's din. Working quickly, they dismantled the cot's wheels and hoisted the bed onto the cargo area.

The young driver recognized Lin Qiaoqiao. "Miss, would you like the front seat?"

Qiaoqiao declined with a tight smile, choosing the rear cargo bed instead. When the driver's gaze lingered on Siqi's ethereal beauty accentuated by her cultivator robes, Qiaoqiao smacked his head sharply. "Keep your eyes to yourself unless you want them gouged out!"

The chastened driver accelerated hastily. Though the rugged path jostled passengers mercilessly, the journey smoothed upon reaching paved roads.

"We should change Siqi's attire before reaching the city," Guan Yu suggested. "Her current robes will draw unnecessary attention."

Second to Wolf agreed, "Find common clothing to blend in."

When Qiaoqiao reluctantly provided oversized, drab servant's garments, Siqi emerged transformed—her natural elegance undiminished by the ill-fitting clothes. "True beauty transcends attire," Guan Yu remarked, admiring her flushed cheeks and fleeting smile that seemed to brighten the surroundings.

Upon reaching a small suburban city by midmorning, the group stopped at a noodle shop. "Let's find vehicle rentals while others eat," Guan Yu proposed.

At the police station, officers directed them to a used car market. "We need immediate transportation without bureaucratic delays," Second to Wolf grumbled as they surveyed rows of vehicles.

Guan Yu surveyed the options pragmatically. "Better to purchase temporarily than risk being stranded with that noisy tricycle again."

Throughout the ordeal, Siqi observed modern marvels with childlike wonder—her sheltered life in the Yunqing Sect leaving her unprepared for bustling streets and "metal carriages." Yet even in borrowed servant's clothes, her otherworldly grace turned heads, much to Qiaoqiao's simmering irritation.

As the group prepared to continue their urgent journey, the agricultural tricycle's fading roar symbolized their transition between worlds—where cultivators met machinery, timeless beauty clashed with modern pragmatism, and unpredictable fate governed every turn.
