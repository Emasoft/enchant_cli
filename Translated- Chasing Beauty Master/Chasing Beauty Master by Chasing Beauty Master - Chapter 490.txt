Upon hearing these words, the reactions of those present varied greatly, with Luo Xi's being the most conspicuous. She hadn't expected Guan Yu to single her out so deliberately, and a faint ripple of pleasure secretly stirred in her heart.

Yet she was still angry with him! Tossing her head back and pouting, she declared, "I refuse! Hmph! Who wants to accompany you, you big perverted dragon? Go find Mona! Weren't you being all cozy with her earlier?"

As she spoke, Luo Xi shot a sidelong glance at the elven beauty who had handed water to Guan Yu.

Completely ignoring Luo Xi's protest, Guan Yu instead sauntered over to Jiamei until his face hovered inches from her delicate features. With a roguish grin, he teased, "Such fiery temper? Could it be... you're jealous?"

"Y-you're the jealous one! Your entire family's jealous!" Luo Xi shoved him away, flushing crimson. "Grand Priestess, look at how... how despicable he is!"

Surprisingly, the Grand Priestess showed no sympathy. Sternly, she rebuked, "How presumptuous! Young Master Guan is an honored guest of our elven kind. How dare you treat him with such discourtesy?"

"Ah, what a disappointment," Guan Yu sighed dramatically. "If such a simple request can't be granted, it seems the bond between dragonkind and elves remains fragile indeed!"

"Young Master speaks too harshly. Luo Xi, I hereby command you to attend our guest properly. Should he express any dissatisfaction, you alone shall answer for it!"

"But—"

"No 'buts'! Remember my words. Now, all of you—dismissed!" With that, the Grand Priestess leaped into the air and vanished into the dense forest behind her.

The others, cowed by her authority, quickly dispersed and melted back into the woods.

The once lively path now stood deserted, leaving only Guan Yu, Luo Xi, Amy, and Kelly behind.

"Brother Dragon, let me accompany you too! I know the Elven Woods well!" Amy chirped, clinging to Guan Yu's arm.

Seeing her younger sister's eagerness, Luo Xi hastily interjected, "Fine! Amy, Kelly—both of you come with me!" She shot Guan Yu a pointed glare. "Otherwise, your sister might fall prey to certain... unscrupulous characters!"

Innocent Amy blinked in confusion. "Unscrupulous? Where? Oh, but Brother Dragon would protect us from any villains!"

Guan Yu patted his little admirer's head affectionately. "Such a sensible lass. I'll dote on you alone from now on—unlike some ungrateful souls."

"You..."

"'You' what? As your guest, you should show proper respect. Little ones," he addressed Amy and Kelly, "go visit your families. Miss Luo Xi—quit dawdling. Let's go!"

Luo Xi stared at Guan Yu's shameless expression, her brief flicker of goodwill vanishing instantly. Kelly watched the bickering pair with mixed emotions—part of her almost envied Luo Xi's position. Though Guan Yu acted the rogue at times, his roguish charm held an undeniable allure.

With a sigh, Kelly led Amy away, leaving Luo Xi alone with Guan Yu.

Suddenly finding herself isolated with him, Luo Xi's cheeks flushed anew. Though she could quarrel boldly before others, this intimate solitude left her defenseless.

"Let me... show you around," she finally offered, breaking the tense silence.

"Wait!" Guan Yu stopped her. "About that Mona..."

At the name, Luo Xi's demeanor hardened. "Mona again? If you fancy her so much, why insist on my company?"

"Ahem—did you swallow gunpowder?" Guan Yu raised an eyebrow, well aware of her jealousy yet amazed by its intensity.

"Hmph! You're the explosive one!"

"I meant—what exactly was that water Mona gave me?"

Luo Xi's expression softened slightly. "You should've said so earlier! That was our elvenkind's supreme treasure—the Source of Life! Only our most honored guests may partake."

"Source of Life? Never heard of it. Shouldn't such a treasure taste exquisite? Yet it burned like boiling lava in my gut. Does it react differently with non-elves?"

Luo Xi shook her head. "The Source enhances absorption of natural elements. Its sweetness is renowned, but its true marvel lies in its mystical properties."

"Elemental absorption? No wonder elves master magic better than other races!"

"Precisely. This blessing became our curse—many covet it. Our people grew powerful through the Source, yet nearly perished because of it."

A shadow crossed Luo Xi's face. Watching her sorrow, Guan Yu felt an unexpected pang. "Well, with me here, none shall threaten your Source again."

"What?" Luo Xi stared. From others, such boasts would earn scorn—countless elven heroes had failed where this youth claimed success. Yet after a pause, she nodded firmly. "I believe you."

"Naturally! Who else would you trust, if not your husband?"

"Must you always jest? Hey—where are you going?"

"To find the Source!"

"Wait! Outsiders aren't allowed—" Luo Xi hurried after his retreating figure.

**Chapter 1241: First Encounter with an Elven Maiden**

Guan Yu gaped at the impossible sight—a solitary island amidst endless forest. Once again, Blue Beauty Continent defied expectations.

"It's there," Luo Xi pointed.

"Let's investigate."

Luo Xi hesitated. "The Source is our most guarded secret. We need special permission..."

"So you can't fulfill this request?"

"It's not that... I lack the authority. Taking you there would mean severe punishment!"

"You fear their punishment, but not mine?"

In one motion, Guan Yu seized her slender waist, pulling her flush against him.

"Ah! What are you—" Her eyes widened in shock.

"Isn't it obvious? I want... you."

His lips captured hers before she could protest. Flailing weakly against his back, she muffled cries against his mouth: "Mmh! Let go... you beast... I'll scream..."

Guan Yu had no intention of stopping—he'd never tasted an elven maiden before.

Indeed, elves proved divine creations. Her lips offered transcendent sweetness, her body an explorer's paradise. As his hands roamed from satin thighs to willowy waist—

Voices echoed through the trees. "Luo Xi! Guan Yu!"

"Curses!" Guan Yu swore, releasing her just as a resounding slap struck his cheek.

Luo Xi turned away silently, tears flowing despite her efforts. Rubbing his face, Guan Yu chuckled ruefully—stealing a decades-old virgin kiss merited the strike.

Kelly emerged, breathless. "There you are! The Patriarch summons you!"

Still smarting, Guan Yu snapped, "I'll go later."

Noticing Luo Xi's distress, Kelly rounded on him. "What did you do to her?"

"None of your concern," he retorted coldly.

"Kelly, enough," Luo Xi interjected hoarsely. "I... tripped. Let's go."

As they departed, Kelly shot Guan Yu a venomous glare. He glared back, vowing inwardly: *Cheeky wench—I'll claim you for my harem soon enough.*

**Chapter 1242: The Elven Patriarch**

Twenty minutes later, they stood before a colossal banyan tree—a hundred-meter titan leaning at forty-five degrees, its trunk wide enough to house a palace. A carved staircase ascended through its hollow core, leading to a platform where a dozen elves waited.

Halfway up, guards halted Luo Xi and Kelly. "The Patriarch will see the guest alone."

Guan Yu proceeded until a middle-aged elf of regal bearing addressed him: "You are Guan Yu?"

"I am. And you?"

"How dare you address our Patriarch so casually?!" a young elf barked.

Guan Yu smirked at the hotheaded youth. "Must you screech? You'll give the elders heart attacks."

"Silence, Locke!" The Patriarch chastised before smiling at Guan Yu. "Little Amy sang your praises—you live up to them. You claim dragon heritage?"

Suppressing unease, Guan Yu stood tall. "I do."

The Patriarch's piercing gaze held. Guan Yu maintained eye contact, mind racing: *If he sees through the lie...*

But the ruler simply nodded. "We hope you'll grace our forest longer as our guest."

An elder suddenly interjected: "Since Young Master hails from dragonkind—our honored allies—might we inquire after Elder Kael's recovery from his injuries?"

Guan Yu's mind raced until a voice whispered: *Mention the midnight incident.*

"I know little of Elder Kael," he replied smoothly, "but perhaps we should discuss... another matter."

"What matter?"
