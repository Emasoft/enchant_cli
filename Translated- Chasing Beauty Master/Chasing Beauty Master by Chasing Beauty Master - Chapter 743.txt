After finishing his meal, Chen Tianxiao mentioned he was heading to the basketball court to train. Guan Yu and the others also left the cafeteria. The moment they stepped outside, a voice that spelled trouble rang out: "Younger brother-in-law! I'm here! Did you miss me…?" Without even turning around, Guan Yu already felt a headache coming on. Zhang Han came bouncing over to him.

She eyed Xue Jing warily and declared, "So this woman is your main wife? She's not bad-looking, but nowhere near as pretty as my aunt."

Such words were practically begging for a volcanic eruption. Guan Yu hastily explained, "Jingjing, this is Yang Conghan's niece. She's also a member of our school's taekwondo competition team."

Xue Jing shot Guan Yu a glare brimming with complex emotions—the main message being, "You shameless Guan Yu! You won't even spare an underage loli!" Through gritted teeth, she said, "I'm returning to the classroom."

Wei Hongwei, sensing the gunpowder in Xue Jing's tone, chimed in with an ingratiating smile, "Safe travels, Sister-in-law Jing!" Then he turned to Guan Yu, "Brother Guan, if there's nothing else, I'll head back to class too."

"Wait. Don't leave yet. Stay here," Guan Yu commanded, stopping Wei Hongwei in his tracks.

"Younger brother-in-law, I don't like that woman. Her eyes are so petty," Zhang Han complained while clinging to Guan Yu's arm and swinging it against her chest.

"What brings you here? Did you finish all your snacks?" Guan Yu asked. With this little ancestor, it was best to humor her whims—the alternative was unthinkable.

"No! The competition is the day after tomorrow. I want you to accompany me for training!"

Guan Yu's eyes suddenly lit up as he turned to Wei Hongwei. "Right, Wei-ge! Didn't we say we had something important to do earlier…?" He blinked pointedly at his friend.

Wei Hongwei instantly caught on. "Ah! Y-yes! It's urgent business! We need to… go take a bath! Yeah, that's right—bathing!"

The bath excuse was Wei Hongwei's spur-of-the-moment inspiration. He figured this would shake off the loli—after all, a girl couldn't possibly follow men to bathe. *Heh, my genius never fails!*

Guan Yu put on a regretful face. "Sorry, I already promised to go bathing with him. Can't train with you. How about this—go find Chen Tianxiao at the basketball court. He's my good friend. Just say I sent you. He'll definitely help."

Zhang Han pouted, thoroughly displeased. "I don't want anyone else! If you won't go, neither will I! If you're bathing, I'm bathing too!"

"Wha—?!" Both Wei Hongwei and Guan Yu gaped. This little menace was impossible to shake off!

"Absolutely not! Men's baths are no place for girls. You'd get seen naked! Besides, didn't the Yang family head forbid you from leaving campus?" Guan Yu argued.

"Fine. I'll return to class and eat snacks. But you must come find me after bathing!" Guan Yu nodded at Zhang Han's unbearably cute face.

After she left, Guan Yu praised Wei Hongwei, "Well done, Wei-ge! You caught my drift with just a look."

"Of course! After surviving life-and-death situations with you, how could I miss this?"

"Tch. Give you an inch and you take a mile…"

Wei Hongwei chuckled before growing serious. "Brother Guan, I've had people dig into Zhang Han's background. No results—no records except that she's a Yang family relative whose parents were killed over a decade ago. She's been raised by the Yangs, but it's suspicious. Everyone has records unless they're hiding something. We can't even find her parents' names."

Guan Yu pondered. If Zhang Han's identity was concealed, the Yangs must be behind it. But why? Only the Yangs knew the truth.

"Remember when Zhang Han was nearly kidnapped recently? Who do you think was behind that?"

As they strolled through the school grove, Wei Hongwei suddenly snapped his fingers. "On surface, it looks like targeting the Yangs. But I suspect the kidnappers wanted something specific from Zhang Han herself."

**Chapter 1885: Couple Style**

Guan Yu mulled over Wei Hongwei's words. *What could someone desperately want from Zhang Han?* "Keep investigating this thoroughly," he ordered.

"Don't worry, Brother Guan. My men are on it. We'll get to the bottom of this."

Returning to class, Guan Yu was about to nap when Lü Mei placed an exquisite box on his desk. "What's this?" he asked curiously.

"A gift for you," she replied, cheeks flushing.

When Guan Yu moved to open it, she stopped him. "Not now! Wait until we're alone."

"Such secrecy? Now I'm even more curious."

"You'll see later." During break when the classroom emptied, Guan Yu finally opened the box. Inside lay a men's translucent triangular brief—luxuriously soft and elastic, branded "Key" with a buxom silhouette printed front and center.

Just then, two female classmates turned and gasped at the revealing garment. Thinking Guan Yu had stripped in class, they fled in scandalized haste.

"Put it away, you idiot!" Lü Mei snatched back the brief, face crimson.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Don't misunderstand! This isn't mine—Lü Mei bought it. Want me to prove I'm wearing one?"

After the flustered girls left, Guan Yu eyed Lü Mei. "Since when did our little princess buy such bold gifts?"

"I… saw a couple's edition online. Bought matching pairs." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "The women's version… has a muscular man printed… down there."

Before Guan Yu could ask, Lü Mei yanked up her skirt for a two-second flash—revealing the promised design. The sight nearly gave him a nosebleed.

Later, Lü Mei explained, "You have so many women. I need to make sure you remember me… even when taking off others' underwear."

Blushing furiously, she added, "Mom wants to meet you tonight."

**Chapter 1886: Business Jade Sister**

After school, as Guan Yu drove Lü Mei home, they encountered Yang Cheng (Dancing Willow's father) picking up Zhang Han. Declining Yang's invitation with promises to visit later, Guan Yu hurried off.

At the Lü mansion, Madam Yao Yu—dubbed "Business Jade Sister" for her commercial acumen—greeted them. Despite her worn appearance from managing the family empire alone, her shrewdness shone through.

"Mother, this is Guan Yu. Didn't I tell you he's wonderful?" Lü Mei clung to his arm.

Yao Yu cut to the chase: "I know you live with another woman. Why pursue my daughter?"

Lü Mei interjected, "He has many women! I don't care—as long as I have a place in his heart!"

Yao Yu sighed. "Child, is my love not enough? Must you share him?"

"Mother, you don't understand…"

As tensions rose, Guan Yu smoothly intervened: "Auntie, your strength inspires me. Rest assured, I'll cherish Mei'er." His silver tongue began weaving its charm, setting the stage for a night where more than conversations would unfold…
