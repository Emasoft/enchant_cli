Guanyu turned his head curiously and asked in a calm voice, “Aunt Right Envoy, why would you help such a traitor? Someone like him deserves death ten thousand times over. Why intervene?”

Chapter 5087: Keeping a Useless Wretch

“Many thanks for your assistance, Right Envoy. I’m eternally grateful. Should you ever need anything in the future, I’ll arrange—” Before Yanzhao could finish, the Right Envoy stood silently nearby, holding a silver whip.

Guanyu finally took a proper look at the weapon. The whip appeared to be an extraordinarily rare treasure, strikingly similar to one he had previously acquired.

Yanzhao pressed on, “Right Envoy, Guanyu deliberately disrupted our plans today. As fellow subordinates of the Demonic Soul Sect, we should join forces against this disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect.”

“You’re not wrong. By principle, that should indeed be the case,” the Right Envoy replied tonelessly, though inwardly she harbored no intention of confronting Guanyu.

Guanyu felt a flicker of unease. Yanzhao was no ordinary foe. If he truly allied with the Right Envoy, their combined strength—particularly the Right Envoy’s formidable abilities—might overpower him.

“Aunt Right Envoy, you know Yanzhao is scum,” Guanyu argued. “He clings to the Demonic Soul Sect without true loyalty. His ambitions are boundless. If not eliminated soon, he’ll become an endless source of trouble.”

“Leave now,” the Right Envoy commanded coldly. “Avoid appearing before Guanyu henceforth. I saved you once—I won’t do so every time.”

Yanzhao stiffened, dismayed that the Right Envoy chose to spare Guanyu rather than seize this perfect opportunity. “Right Envoy! If we don’t kill Guanyu now, he’ll become the sect’s greatest obstacle! He’s alone—together we could—”

“Did you not hear me?” The Right Envoy’s voice cracked like ice. “Leave unless you wish to die. Do you truly believe our combined strength could easily subdue him?”

Yanzhao swallowed his words, teeth clenched. The chance slipped away. Worse, the Right Envoy’s warning implied even their joint efforts might fail to kill Guanyu.

She knew the truth: even if both Envoys were present, Guanyu could likely escape if determined.

With a resentful leap over the wall, Yanzhao departed. Guanyu sighed—with the Right Envoy blocking his path, pursuing Yanzhao was impossible. The hunt would have to wait.

“I don’t understand,” Guanyu pressed. “The Demon Lord isn’t a fool. You know Yanzhao’s ambitions outweigh his loyalty. Why keep such vermin?”

“The Demon Lord has his reasons,” she replied impassively. “Our duty is obedience. Yanzhao remains under the Demon Lord’s direct command. Saving him today was my obligation.”

As Guanyu turned to leave, he declared, “We’ll meet again, Aunt Right Envoy. But next time I see Yanzhao, he won’t leave alive.”

The Right Envoy watched his retreating figure silently, conflicted. By the Demon Lord’s usual orders, she should have attacked Guanyu—especially knowing his group’s destination. The East Sea Treasure had become common knowledge.

The Demon Lord had stationed forces along their route. What would unfold upon reaching the East Sea remained uncertain. Her reluctance to attack stemmed from Wang Xiaorong—a child she cherished—making Guanyu untouchable.

Returning to his quarters, Guanyu found Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi playfighting. They froze guiltily at his entrance.

“Did you find Yanzhao?” Wang Xiaorong asked.

“Yes, but the Right Envoy intervened,” Guanyu replied. “She let him escape. Without her interference, he’d be dead.”

“Aunt Right Envoy is here too?” Wang Xiaorong mused. “The Demonic Soul Sect’s movements suggest greater plans—likely connected to the East Sea Treasure.”

“Regardless, I seek the Eight-Sided Drum techniques,” Guanyu said. “Three volumes obtained, one remains. I’ll risk death for it. Every faction—Red Lotus Sect, Cloud Azure, even True Sun Sect—converges here. A great conflict brews.”

The East Sea Treasure’s legendary wealth drew every power. Smaller sects allied with major ones, knowing solo efforts were futile. Soon, the East Sea would drown in bloodshed.

Though the Cloud Azure Sect monitored Guanyu’s movements, they remained unaware Wang Xiaorong was the Demonic Soul Sect’s young mistress—a revelation that would summon immediate arrest. Her identity demanded utmost secrecy.

Chapter 5088: Wrong From the Start

Guanyu’s greatest fear was Yanzhao exposing his companionship with Wang Xiaorong. Next encounter would permit no mercy.

Jiang Yuankai rested, his spirit improved though his dantian remained ruined. Few could endure becoming a cripple overnight, but thoughts of his wife Princess Chang and daughter Jiang Xin sustained him. Dreams of East Sea riches becoming his family’s legacy kept him hopeful.

At dinner, Guanyu gathered everyone. “We erred from the start,” he admitted. “We should have traveled incognito. Now the entire martial world knows our purpose. They’ll stalk us until we locate the treasure.”

Jiang Yuankai paled. “But how?”

“Our battle at the military camp spread news,” Guanyu said. “The red beast tendon’s discovery confirmed our quest. Now every power eyes us.”

Wang Xiaorong suggested shaking off pursuers, but Guanyu shook his head. “We can’t evade the entire martial world. Our only path is forward.”

Jiang Yuankai revealed he’d summoned loyal retainers for protection. Resigned, Guanyu ceased dissuading him—the treasure’s lure was too strong.

Duan Ruxue chuckled bitterly. “I boarded the most dangerous ship.”

“Danger?” Wang Xiaorong smirked. “This is merely the prelude. Turn back now—give us the route and flee.”

“Never!” Duan Ruxue declared. “I chose this path. I’ll see it through.”

Her courage impressed Guanyu. Most would bargain for safer shares, yet she persevered despite the risks.

A knock interrupted them. A gaunt youth awaited—messenger from Du Teng.

“Brother Du sends word,” the youth whispered after ensuring privacy. Guanyu ushered him into an empty chamber, the plot thickening as shadows gathered around the East Sea’s promise.
