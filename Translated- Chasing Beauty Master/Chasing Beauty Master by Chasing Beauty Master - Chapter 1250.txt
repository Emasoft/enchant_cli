Shi Zhen had not been worried, for when she entered, she had first lit Calming Incense in the room. Thus, even with the commotion outside, Guan Yu would not wake—unless provoked by intense stimulation, when his body might react and rouse him. By then, however, it would no longer matter, as passions would have reached their peak, altering all sensibilities.

“Who’s there?” Guan Yu stirred awake to the noise. The moment his eyes opened, he glimpsed a shadow by his bed. Instinctively, he lashed out with a kick that landed squarely on the figure’s jaw. A white blur flew sideways across his vision.

Before Shi Zhen could react, a crushing blow struck her chin, sending her body soaring through the air. With a dull thud, she collapsed unconscious.

She had not known that Guan Yu possessed an extraordinary constitution resistant to toxins. To claim he was “immune to all poisons” might be an exaggeration...

**Chapter 3213: Give Me an Explanation**

...but Guan Yu’s physical resistance to toxins was formidable. Common poisons or sedatives had no effect on him.

This trait somewhat resembled that of the Poison Widow or Granny Yingshan, who cultivated immunity through long exposure to venomous creatures. Yet Guan Yu’s resistance stemmed not from such practices, but from his status as a Realm Venerable expert. Though his internal energy cultivation had been sealed, his physical resilience remained largely intact.

Even Guan Yu himself did not fully grasp the extent of his toxin immunity. Thus, he remained unaware of the Calming Incense permeating the room, feeling only a faint drowsiness.

Springing upright like a carp leaping from water, Guan Yu saw Shi Zhen—whom he had kicked—lying motionless, her head having struck the floor tiles. She had fainted instantly.

These immortal cultivators possessed frail physiques, utterly lacking the robust endurance of martial artists. A single blow had rendered her unconscious.

Crouching on the bed, Guan Yu finally recognized the figure he had sent flying: a woman clad only in a white sleeping robe. Her current posture was undignified, the robe scarcely concealing her form.

Guan Yu furrowed his brow and stood, perplexed. All windows and doors remained securely fastened. How had she entered? Perhaps she bore no ill intent, merely seeking clandestine dual cultivation.

In the heat of the moment, Guan Yu had reacted without thought—a pale shape flickering in his vision, met by an instinctive kick. Had he known it was a woman, he would never have struck so harshly. Outside, cries of “Thief! Catch the thief!” echoed.

Alarm surged through him. If others discovered this unconscious woman in his room, no amount of explanation would suffice.

After a moment’s consideration, Guan Yu decided to investigate the commotion first. He opened the door to find disciples scurrying chaotically about the courtyard like headless flies.

A female disciple approached, asking urgently, “Handsome, have you seen a thief in white robes?”

Guan Yu paused. The description matched the woman in his room—a disciple of Dai Shouzuo (Violet Leader), hardly a thief. Seizing the opportunity, he replied, “Yes. She barged into my chamber. I knocked her out. She’s wearing a white sleeping gown.”

Stepping aside, he allowed the disciple to enter. Her shriek echoed: “Senior Sister Shi Zhen! Are you alright? How could Senior Sister be a thief?”

The disciple rushed out, summoning nearly all of Convergence Peak’s members to Guan Yu’s quarters.

The crowd stared at Shi Zhen’s prone form, exchanging bewildered glances. Xiao Lian demanded, “Junior Brother Guan, why was Senior Sister Shi in your room? Explain yourself!”

“How should I know?” Guan Yu spread his hands. “I was asleep, sensed someone nearby, and kicked reflexively. I didn’t hold back—didn’t realize it was her.”

Siqi arrived, observing the scene. Though others might doubt Guan Yu, she trusted him. Having witnessed his propriety toward beauties like Xiao Zhu and Lin Qiaoqiao, she knew Shi Zhen must have intruded willingly, only to meet an ignoble end.

Xiao Chun suggested, “Let’s await Master’s judgment.”

**———**

Twenty-odd disciples packed the chamber, leaving scant standing room. The stagnant air exacerbated their drowsiness as they awaited their master’s verdict.

Dai Shouzuo swept in, voice preceding her: “What nonsense is this? Midnight disturbances instead of rest?”

Upon seeing Shi Zhen, her sharp gaze swept the room. “Who will account for this? Be thorough.”

A disciple timidly recounted spotting a white-clad figure skulking under moonlight before raising the alarm. Guan Yu then reported finding the “thief” unconscious in his room.

Dai Shouzuo fixed Guan Yu with a piercing look. “How did my disciple enter your quarters?”

“Honored Auntie Dai,” Guan Yu countered, “I locked my door. How did your disciple breach it? Your sect’s methods are impressive indeed.”

**Chapter 3214: No Peaceful Days**

“Other matters will be addressed in time,” Dai Shouzuo pressed. “Explain her presence here.”

“Ask her!” Guan Yu feigned innocence. “I was asleep when someone appeared bedside. I kicked instinctively—saw white, then found her downed. Had I known it was a woman...”

Dai Shouzuo’s scrutiny deepened. With Siqi present, she doubted Guan Yu would assault Shi Zhen unprovoked. Clearly, the disciple had overstepped.

Internally, the Violet Leader regretted permitting Guan Yu’s stay. Housing a man among female disciples invited trouble.

“Xiao Chun, Xiao Lian—take Shi Zhen for treatment.” As her disciples complied, Dai Shouzuo pondered Shi Zhen’s motivations. The plain-faced disciple, long isolated from male company, might have succumbed to desperation upon encountering Guan Yu.

Yet something felt amiss. Dai Shouzuo’s spiritual energy waned unnaturally. She inspected the room, discovering a bamboo tube by the window—a Convergence Peak specialty, Calming Incense.

“Do you know what this is?” She brandished the tube.

Guan Yu sniffed the lingering fragrance. “Pleasant scent. Some sort of incense?”

“This,” Dai Shouzuo intoned, “is Calming Incense—potent enough to induce deathlike slumber. Yet you remain unaffected. Why?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Perhaps your tales exaggerate its potency?”

“Observe the others.”

Indeed, the disciples swayed listlessly, overwhelmed by the incense’s effects. Guan Yu extinguished the stick with tea.

**Chapter 3215: Tossing and Turning**

“I’ve no explanation,” Guan Yu deflected. “It simply doesn’t work on me.”

Dai Shouzuo elaborated the incense’s rare herbal composition, hinting at external covetousness. Guan Yu feigned disinterest.

“Honored Auntie, this matter is settled. I’d appreciate some rest.”

After the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu lay awake, analyzing events. The Calming Incense’s subtle effect explained his delayed reaction. Shi Zhen’s intrusion reeked of ulterior motives—not mere lust, but perhaps designs on his magical artifacts.

As moonlight filtered through the window, Guan Yu resolved: Convergence Peak’s tranquility was illusory. Here, no peaceful days awaited.
