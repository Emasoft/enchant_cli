Moreover, ammunition would eventually run out. Once their bullets were depleted, these men dared not pause to reload, for the ravenous wolfhounds would seize that moment to launch ferocious assaults. The inevitable outcome would be a gruesome death beneath those fanged jaws.

When their guns fell silent, they wielded empty firearms as crude weapons, clashing head-on with the beasts. Men lacking combat skill or physical fortitude could scarcely withstand two waves of attacks before being torn apart by razor-sharp teeth.

Roughly fifteen minutes later, only three remained standing: Yang Long and two others.

By then, over half the wolfhounds lay dead. Those still alive seemed to falter, their earlier ferocity dimmed by the humans' desperate resistance.

The lull in the hounds' aggression allowed Yang Long a fleeting breath of relief.

Those fifteen minutes had been harrowing. Their bodies bore countless bite marks; arms, faces, and thighs were lacerated by claws. The two less-skilled fighters fared worst—their hands mangled into bloody pulp, a grotesque testament to the struggle.

Exhaustion weighed heavily. Another assault would surely break them.

Yang Long, marginally less battered, suffered only torn flesh on his arms. His battle-hardened physique and conserved stamina made him the trio's last bastion of strength.

Surveying the carnage—fallen comrades and wolfhounds alike—Yang Long's heart clenched. These hounds were his brainchild, nurtured with meticulous care. Their deaths pained him as much as those of his sworn brothers, men who'd shared life and death with him, bonds deeper than blood.

Yet deepest of all cuts was this cruel irony: his brothers had perished by the very beasts he'd trained.

All of this—every loss—traced back to Guan Yu. Hatred seethed in Yang Long's veins, but recklessness now meant suicide. Survival first, vengeance later.

"Preserve the green hills, and firewood will never lack," he muttered, mind racing. Signaling the others, he hissed, "We leave. Now."

The two men nearly wept with relief. But as their guard dropped, the weary wolfhounds struck. Jaws snapped shut—two more lives extinguished.

Yang Long's eyes flushed crimson, breath ragged. Scanning the shadows, he roared, "Guan Yu! I know it's you! Get the hell out here! Stop skulking—kill me cleanly if you dare!"

He'd realized the truth: Guan Yu lurked in darkness, toying with them, savoring their despair. Rage erupted like magma, scorching through restraint.

"*Heh.* 'Skulking' suits *you* better," Guan Yu remarked coolly, emerging from shadows. His smile held no warmth, eyes glacial.

Yang Long glared, venom pooling in his gaze. Had looks could kill, Guan Yu would've died a thousand deaths in that instant.

"What do you want?" Yang Long ground out.

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. "*I* should be asking *you*. What game are you playing?"

**Chapter 609: Escape**

Moments ago, Guan Yu had exuded lazy indifference. Now, his aura sharpened—a blade unsheathed. Yang Long, veteran of countless underworld storms, felt unease prickle his spine.

Guan Yu's use of "*you*" (plural) betrayed deeper knowledge. Yang Long's mind raced—had their trio's connection to Wan Qianshan been exposed? Only one weak link came to mind: Qian Tong. The traitor.

Fury surged. To be outwitted by a pawn they'd deemed disposable! Yet perhaps they'd underestimated Guan Yu all along.

The young man's patience was inhuman. Two months of silence after dismantling Qian Tong's operations—had Guan Yu been waiting for them to stumble? Or weaving darker schemes?

Yang Long reassessed: this foe's cunning ran deep.

Guan Yu leaned forward, predator-like. "Had enough time to think? Answer me."

"Go to hell!" Yang Long spat. "Kill me if you can!"

Smirking, Guan Yu pressed: "Think silence protects Zhou Jin and Chu Hong? That I don't know your ties to Wan Qianshan? What's your plot in N City?"

Yang Long's pupils constricted. Without warning, he exploded into motion—feet pivoting, fists flying. Words bred mistakes; action spoke clearer.

"Fool's choice," Guan Yu sneered, meeting the charge.

Their fists collided—a dull *crack*—each stumbling back. Yang Lung pressed the advantage, fists hammering Guan Yu's defenses. A brutal strike to the left arm sent Guan Yu sprawling, but he rolled with the impact, minimizing damage—a technique honed under Elder Xu's merciless training.

As Guan Yu regained footing, ready to counter, he froze. Yang Long was... fleeing.

"God damn it! Another 'master' without honor!" Guan Yu cursed.

**Chapter 610: Cat's Play**

Yang Long's "victory" was a feint. Heart pounding, he bolted through darkness. Stamina dwindling, he knew prolonged combat meant death—either by Guan Yu's hand or the remaining hounds.

His escape plan hinged on buying distance. That punch should cripple Guan Yu's arm, granting precious minutes. Survival meant warning Zhou Jin—Guan Yu knew *everything*.

But canine howls soon echoed behind him. Four legs outraced two. Changing tactics, Yang Long veered off-path, plunging into blackness. If he couldn't outrun, he'd outhide.

Yet the night itself seemed alive. A wolfhound lunged from shadows—teeth grazing his throat. Yang Long's retaliatory punch snapped its spine, but the brief scuffle betrayed his position.

He fled anew, stones tripping him, knees scraping earth. No respite—the pack closed in.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu activated his detection system. A cruel smile curled his lips as he dispatched the remaining hounds. "Cat and mouse, eh? Let's play."

Yang Long ran blindly, ears straining. When the next attack came—a silent lunge from ahead—he barely dodged. The hound's death cry summoned others.

Cornered, exhausted, Yang Long faced the inevitable: this stygian void was Guan Yu's domain. Every shadow hid teeth. Every breath might be his last.

But still he ran—because to stop was to die.
