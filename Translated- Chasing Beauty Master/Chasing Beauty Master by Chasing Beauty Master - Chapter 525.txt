The guard, seeing this, asked no further questions and prepared to open the gate. At that moment, Guan Yu glanced around and inquired, “By the way, young man, let me ask you something. Do you know where to find many magical beasts near the Elfwood?”

“Ah, the place teeming with the most magical beasts would be the Valley of Peril! Head northeast from the Elfwood for about a hundred li. That area is crawling with high-tier magical beasts. Neither humans nor elves venture there lightly—one misstep could cost your life.”

“Valley of Peril? I see. Thank you, young man. Farewell for now.” As Guan Yu turned to leave, he suddenly remembered something and added, “Oh, and don’t mention my visit to the Valley of Peril to anyone.”

**Chapter 1328: The Magical Beast Emerges**

After Guan Yu departed through the narrow pass, the guard didn’t press further, though bewilderment filled his thoughts. “Heading to the Valley of Peril at this hour? Is he courting death?”

Following the guard’s directions, Guan Yu sprinted for nearly an hour before his stamina began to falter. Freshly roused from unconsciousness and faced with the forest’s nocturnal haze, oxygen deprivation came easily.

“Ugh, exhausted! Where are you, Jin Gang? Your grandpa’s running his legs off to find you a decent host, and you can’t even bother to show gratitude!”

After a minute of silence, Guan Yu nearly cursed Jin Gang’s lack of conscience when a hushed warning echoed in his ear: “Shh, Sect Leader. Stay quiet. We’re nearing the Valley of Peril. I sense formidable presences ahead.”

At this, Guan Yu sobered, scanning the surroundings. Though nothing seemed amiss initially, a few steps forward brought an oppressive weight to the air. His instincts sharpened—a magical beast lurked nearby.

“Sect Leader, our luck holds! If this beast is small, we’ll claim it!”

“Enough chatter. I know what I’m doing.” With a leap, Guan Yu vaulted into a tree, deciding to traverse the canopy to avoid ambushes.

Advancing branch by branch, the suffocating aura intensified, signaling the beast’s awareness of his approach. Ordinarily, Guan Yu might have retreated, but today’s purpose steeled his resolve.

Concealing his energy to evade detection, Guan Yu crept closer—only for the beast’s presence to vanish abruptly. Before he could ponder, two yellow lights streaked toward him. He dodged just as a thunderous roar split the tree he’d stood on.

“Your grandpa’s, that’s downright insane!”

Gaping at the sundered giant tree, Guan Yu recognized the attack as pure physical might—a terrifying feat. Magical beasts typically wielded both physical and magical prowess, but raw strength of this magnitude was rare.

This beast’s robust physique made it ideal for Jin Gang’s needs. Yet after evading, the creature disappeared again, masking its aura—proof of high intelligence.

“Sect Leader, above you!”

Guan Yu twisted aside, but a shadowy form pounced. His tempered body, honed through cultivation and the Crystal Toad’s blessings, proved tougher than bark.

“Scram!” He seized the furry attacker—a creature resembling a wildcat. A sharp pinch to its tail elicited a yowl, confirming his guess.

The cat retreated, crouching warily ten meters away, violet eyes gleaming like gemstones in the moonlight.

“Sect Leader, this cub seems juvenile. Its magical prowess remains unclear.”

“Can’t be weak, given that earlier aura. Stay cautious.”

As Guan Yu spoke, the cat’s eyes shifted from yellow to blue.

“A Profound Rank beast! Impressive for its size. Well, Jin Gang? Satisfied? I’ll capture it alive if so.”

“Sect Leader, look! Its color’s changing again!”

The eyes now glowed faintly purple.

“Your grandpa’s—an Earth Rank! No wonder its aura overwhelmed us. We’re taking it down!”

Edging closer, Guan Yu cooed, “Easy there, little one. I’m not your enemy. Come to your master…”

At five meters, the cat lunged, tail crackling with lightning. Guan Yu dodged, only for the bolt to expand into a net, engulfing him.

**Chapter 1329: The Pika Cat**

“Holy crap, is this thing a Pikachu?” Guan Yu gaped as electricity arced from the cat’s tail.

*Zzzzt!*

The shock left him dazed. Had his physique not been enhanced, he’d have collapsed. “Trying to kill me, you little fiend?”

Retreating, he weighed his options. Dawn approached—failure loomed if he couldn’t subdue it.

“Can’t grab it without getting fried. Need a strategy!”

Jin Gang’s voice chimed, “Sect Leader, you must catch this one! I adore its skill!”

“Shut it! If you’re so keen, help me!”

A realization struck. “Jin Gang, emerge! You’re intangible—it can’t shock you!”

“Ah! Brilliant!”

Materializing as a phantom, Jin Gang appraised the cat. “A cub still. It’ll grow stronger.”

“Flank it. Don’t let it flee!”

As Jin Gang advanced, the cat unleashed lightning futilely. Panicked, it bolted—only for Guan Yu to ensnare it in an elemental-nullifying aura.

Gripping its scruff, Guan Yu grinned. “Behave, little treasure.”

The cat stilled, wide-eyed. Its fur felt luxuriously soft. “This pelt’d make a fine coat!”

*Meow!*

“Hah! It understands!” Turning to Jin Gang, he asked, “How’s the merger done?”

“Extract its magic core. I’ll fuse with it before reinsertion.”

“Won’t that kill it?”

“No. Channel your energy to draw the core out. Once visible, I’ll inhabit it.”

Though skeptical, Guan Yu complied. Exhaustion gnawed at him as he wrestled the squirming cat. At Jin Gang’s urging, he redoubled his efforts—prompting the cat to retch violently.

“Sect Leader, push harder!”

The cat convulsed, howling piteously. Guan Yu’s resolve wavered. “Jin Gang, one last try. If this fails, we quit.”

**Chapter 1330: Successful Symbiosis**

Summoning his remaining strength, Guan Yu unleashed a surge of energy. The cat gagged, expelling a violet orb—its magic core. Jin Gang’s spirit dove into the orb, which then reentered the cat.

The creature collapsed, limp but alive. Guan Yu sealed its elemental channels and gently stroked its head.

“Sect Leader, stop petting. I’m still integrating.”

“How long?”

“Patience. Once merged, this Earth Rank host will serve you well.”

Guan Yu sighed, eyeing the listless cat. “Better be worth the trouble.”
