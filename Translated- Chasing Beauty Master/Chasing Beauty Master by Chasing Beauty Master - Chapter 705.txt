“So Wei Hongwei happened to have a few people with him and rescued Wang Xiaoqian. Wang Xiaoqian is a student at Yangzhou Academy, Class 7 of Grade One.”

“Yangzhou Academy is a prestigious institution. Though not as extravagant as Kaihuang Academy, its student quality is second to none. Moreover, Kaihuang’s entry threshold is too high, making Yangzhou Academy the second choice for minor wealthy families or low-profile individuals.”

“Hehehe, who’d have thought our Brother Wei would perform a heroic rescue of a beauty? But you two are fated! Let me remind you—I’m the matchmaker here. If I hadn’t asked Brother Wei to monitor Liu Shuowei’s movements, he wouldn’t have stumbled upon this chance to save the damsel, and you’d never have met. Right?”

Though Guan Yu spoke lightly, he felt an inexplicable unease lingering beneath the surface. Something about this situation felt off, though he couldn’t pinpoint what. He decided to shelve the matter for later contemplation.

“Exactly! Brother Guan played matchmaker. Since we’ve afternoon classes and can’t drink, I’ll toast you with juice instead.” Wei Hongwei, visibly thriving these days with a healthy glow, raised his glass.

The group chattered merrily through lunch. “Since Jia Bo joined us today, consider yourself one of the brothers. Eat your fill—no need for formalities,” Guan Yu urged warmly.

Wei added, “Brother Guan, you might not know this—Jia Bo’s no ordinary guy. He’s one of Kaihuang Academy’s top eight martial artists in freestyle combat.”

“That impressive?” Guan Yu eyed Jia Bo’s lean frame with surprise, never guessing the unassuming youth harbored such prowess.

**Chapter 1791: Sharing the Same Man**

In City A, annual inter-academy competitions—particularly the highly anticipated martial arts tournaments—serve as battlegrounds for institutional prestige. Officially labeled “taekwondo” events to sidestep political sensitivities, these contests actually showcase Chinese martial arts. Last year’s shock victory by a mutated contestant from Hanggui Academy underscored the unspoken rule: any means justify the end, so long as you emerge victorious.

While basketball matches, beauty pageants, and other sports exist, none rival the martial arts tournaments in popularity.

As lunch concluded, Guan Yu presented Lü Mei with an elegant ladies’ watch selected by Xue Jing. “A token of gratitude for joining me. This is my first gift to a girl—you can’t refuse.”

“Whoa, Brother Guan! Your debut gift is luxury goods? You’re too extravagant!” Wei Hongwei marveled at the timepiece, its brand lost in a jumble of foreign letters.

Lü Mei’s heart churned. She yearned to accept—not for the object, but the giver. Yet accepting felt like consenting to share a man already claimed. During Guan Yu’s basketball showdown with Han Qiao, she’d seen Xue Jing’s devotion. Did her beauty and family status warrant entering this rivalry?

“No,” she resolved silently. But refusing publicly would humiliate him. Torn, she hesitated until Guan Yu broke the silence: “Do you like it? Xue Jing helped choose the design. We can exchange it if you prefer.”

His words backfired. Lü Mei stiffened—mentioning Xue Jing now? Was he branding her a homewrecker? That watch reeked of another woman’s taste.

Biting her lip, she stood abruptly. “Keep gifts for special occasions. Since your girlfriend picked this, give it to her. Thanks for lunch.”

Her exit left stunned silence. Wei Hongwei broke it: “She’s proud, Brother Guan—jealous of Xue Jing. Go after her!”

But Guan Yu’s pride held firm. Let her reconsider. If she couldn’t accept his world, so be it.

**Chapter 1792: Shameless Persistence**

That evening, Xue Jing laughed mercilessly when Guan Yu offered her the rejected watch. “The great Casanova struck out? Heaven has eyes!”

After recounting the debacle, Guan Yu endured her scolding: “You invited spectators to a confession! And flaunted my involvement? No wonder she refused!”

“Maybe I should’ve...” Guan Yu trailed off, realizing his blunder.

Xue Jing’s mockery softened. “In our past, women flocked to you. I had to beg for your notice. But you’re different now—kinder. Maybe that’s better.”

When Guan Yu pressed about his amnesia, she deflected. “Ask the others.” They all agreed—his forgotten past brimmed with violence best left buried.

At a luxury hotel, Chen Maosheng plotted revenge. “That bastard stole my girl! I’ll humiliate him yet.”

His companion Hei Zi smirked. “I’ve got paralytic drugs. Dose them, and you can ravish Lü Mei before his helpless eyes.”

Chen’s grin turned feral. “Perfect.”

**Chapter 1793: A Relic from the 80s**

At the Lü residence, Madam Yao noticed her daughter’s gloom. “Did someone bully you?”

“No, Mother.” Lü Mei wandered the garden, tormented by regret. Had she overreacted? How to apologize?

Unseen, the family steward Wang investigated Guan Yu—a task proving strangely difficult. The boy’s background defied even the Lü family’s considerable reach.

Next morning, Wei Hongwei greeted Guan Yu eagerly: “Brother! Did the watch work?”
