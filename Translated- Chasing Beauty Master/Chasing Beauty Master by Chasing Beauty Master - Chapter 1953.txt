With a twist of his right wrist, golden light erupted from his fingertip as Guan Yu pointed at Xuan Ming. A radiant beam shot forth, crossing dozens of meters in the blink of an eye to strike the target.

Xuan Ming hastily aborted his incantation, raising the Hidden Dragon Sword before him as a shield. Yet with a resounding crash, the golden pillar sent him flying through the air. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he crashed to the ground.

“You struck first, Master Xuan Ming,” Guan Yu declared coldly, striding forward. His voice carried across the battlefield. “Your shameless greed for the East Sea Dragon Pearl knows no bounds. Today, our master-disciple bond ends.”

The crowd stared in disbelief. The same Guan Yu who had been severely wounded by Sun Lianzi now radiated terrifying power. Even the Demon Lord’s eyes bulged—how could a Nascent Soul cultivator repel Xuan Ming and disarm the legendary Hidden Dragon Sword?

As Guan Yu advanced, Yunqing Sect elders joined hands to unleash a barrage of spells. A translucent shield materialized around Guan Yu, deflecting all attacks. The rebound force sent the elders staggering, coughing blood.

“Your seal…it’s broken,” gasped Elder Lu, realization dawning.

Guan Yu stood over his former master. “From this moment, we share no ties.” Xuan Ming could only glare, fresh blood staining his lips as Guan Yu turned toward the Scarlet Lotus Sect’s position.

Sun Lianzi paled, sweat beading his forehead. “G-Guan Yu! Our quarrel was a misunderstanding—”

A thunderous slap echoed across the field despite the distance between them. Sun Lianzi tumbled to the ground, dignity shattered. “You sought my life moments ago,” Guan Yu sneered. “Now plead mercy?”

Enraged, Xuan Ming rose clutching the Hidden Dragon Sword. With a slash across his palm, the blade dissolved into azure light that merged with his body—a forbidden technique Elder Lu recognized too late. “Senior Brother! Don’t!”

The Yunqing Sect leader’s eyes burned crimson as demonic energy surged. Two streaks of light—gold and corrupted azure—collided in cataclysmic bursts, shaking the earth. When the dust settled, Guan Yu stood bleeding but victorious. The Hidden Dragon Sword clattered to the ground, its wielder reduced to ashes.

“Senior Brother!” Yunqing disciples knelt in mourning as Guan Yu retrieved the divine blade. Though wounded by its lingering剑气, his gaze swept across the broken factions—Scarlet Lotus and Demon Sect leaders crippled, Yunqing’s path uncertain.

“It ends here,” he declared.

Returning to the abyss’ edge, Guan Yu entrusted the East Sea Dragon Pearl to Jiang Yuankai. To his awaiting companions, he simply said, “Escort them home.” Then, with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi in his arms, he vanished—reappearing instantly at Swordless Manor.

After settling affairs with steward Du Teng, Guan Yu visited the Vermilion Opera House one last time. “This place is yours now, Chu Fan,” he told the stunned manager. “My true name is Guan Yu. Farewell.”

As they departed, Wang Xiaorong hesitated. “May I…bid father goodbye?”

At Demon Soul Sect’s secret chamber, the injured Demon Lord embraced his daughter. “Go,” he murmured, tears glistening. “Seek your happiness.”

Through tear-blurred eyes, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi gaped at the alien world before them—skyscrapers piercing clouds, metallic beasts roaring across paved rivers. Guan Yu smiled at their wonder, leading them through the automated gates of Qiaoyuan District.

The security system chimed. In the kitchen, Xue Jing dropped a plate. On the surveillance screen, a face long mourned smiled back.

“He’s home!”

As weeping women rushed into his arms, Guan Yu breathed deep the air of his reclaimed world. Behind him, Second-to-Wolf chuckled at the newcomers’ awe. “Strap in, ladies. This is just the beginning.”

The End.
