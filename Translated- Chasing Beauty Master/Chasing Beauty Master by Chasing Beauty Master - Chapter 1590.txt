Chapter 4123 Reunion With an Old Acquaintance

"So that's how it is. Seems I exposed myself after all," Guanyu chuckled, scratching his head. "I merely wished to avoid inconveniencing our people, hence the disguise. Let me introduce you—this is Brother Du Teng, and this is my fiancée. Brother Du, you may call her Xiao Rong."

Guanyu had resorted to presenting Wang Xiaorong as his betrothed both to please her and prevent Du Teng from asking too many questions.

Du Teng smiled faintly at Xiaorong. The beast-hide mask Guanyu had deliberately crafted for her rendered her features unremarkable—neither striking nor unpleasant, the kind of face that would vanish in a crowd. This was Guanyu's hard-earned wisdom: an inconspicuous woman attracted fewer troubles.

"Greetings, Brother Du," Xiaorong inclined her head politely.

"Meeting you both may be the last stroke of fortune in my life," Du Teng replied with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. Guanyu recognized the look—a man resolved to die, marching knowingly towards near-certain demise. He could never comprehend this breed of cultivators who courted death like lovers.

At the gates of Swordless Inn, Du Teng paused. "Wait here, friends. I'll return the room key—no use keeping it if I won't return."

As Guanyu led Xiaorong outside, their attention caught on a figure by the entrance—a woman in pale yellow robes, face veiled in black silk revealing only piercing eyes that snapped towards them. Her gaze carried lethal sharpness, putting Guanyu on edge despite her elegant posture. The wide sword strapped to her back seemed incongruous with her slender frame—an unwieldy choice few women would make.

Xiaorong tugged Guanyu's sleeve, whispering, "Look at her hands." The woman's clenched fists trembled faintly, knuckles whitening as if suppressing volcanic fury or grief.

"Is she here to challenge the Swordless Immortal too?" Xiaorong murmured.

Guanyu shook his head. The woman's qi felt middling at best, her agitation suggesting personal stakes rather than martial ambition. Their speculation halted as Du Teng emerged—and froze.

"You... I told you not to—"

"Why shouldn't I come?" The yellow-robed woman's voice cracked like a whip. Her vehemence startled nesting birds from nearby eaves. "Years of cultivation and challenges—did you ever consider my feelings?"

Guanyu and Xiaorong exchanged glances—a lovers' quarrel, ripe with drama.

"You think discarding me makes you worthy of challenging the Swordless Immortal?" The woman's accusation crescendoed into sobs. "You're no true man!"

Du Teng stood statue-still, gaze lowered. When Guanyu approached, the woman wheeled on them: "Friends, you say? Then counsel this coward who abandons vows!"

"Brother Du," Guanyu pressed, "who is—"

"My former fiancée," Du Teng sighed.

"Former?" The woman's laughter rang bitter. "Two years vanished like morning mist, and 'former' is all I merit?"

Xiaorong's eyes widened at the age disparity—Du Teng nearing sixty winters, his accuser appearing decades younger. Guanyu squeezed her hand in silent reminder: cultivation slowed aging's march.

"Let your friends judge!" The woman swept her veil aside, revealing features preserved in jade-like perfection by spiritual arts. "Nineteen years! Nineteen years we weathered storms together!"

Gasps escaped both listeners. Even in the cultivation world, such prolonged courtship was extraordinary.

"It began when my merchant family opposed our union," she continued, voice steadied by long-nursed grievance. "They wanted advantageous matches—I wanted this block of wood. Through every trial, I believed our love unshakable. When he achieved his great breakthrough..." Her breath hitched. "He changed. Grew distant. Then left this—" She produced a yellowed letter, its creases worn translucent from handling.

Guanyu glimpsed the crumbling script: "...I release you from this deadwood's shadow. Return to your family. Forget me."

"Mother's agents found me unconscious after reading this," she said. "Years later, I traced him here—to throw his life away!" Her glare could have kindled stone. "So tell me, friends—does this deserve forgiveness?"

Chapter 4124 Nineteen Winters

The "youthful" woman's revelation hung heavy. Xiaorong gripped Guanyu's arm, empathy shining in her eyes.

"You speak of nineteen years," Guanyu ventured. "What shattered such endurance?"

A bitter smile twisted her lips. "Pride. When his cultivation ascended, so did his obsession. Nightly, he'd murmur about 'completing the path'—as if our life together were but a stepping stone!" Her finger jabbed at Du Teng. "This fool believes challenging the Swordless Immortal will perfect his dao. I say it's fleeing from life itself!"

Du Teng remained silent, shoulders slumped beneath invisible weights. The woman's voice softened unexpectedly. "Remember when you worked as a dock porter to buy me hairpins? I cherished those copper trinkets more than jade—because they held your sweat and resolve. Why can't you see? My 'better life' is you breathing beside me, not some posthumous glory!"

Guanyu's throat tightened. He recognized the authentic ache of cultivation's paradox—the eternal struggle between earthly bonds and transcendental ambition.

"Brother Du," Xiaorong implored, "how could you abandon such devotion?"

The older cultivator finally stirred. "When my cultivation stagnated, I... I felt unworthy. Her family's scorn became truth—a rootless wanderer offering only hardship." His calloused hands flexed as if grasping vanished sword hilts. "The breakthrough... it awakened realization. My true failure wasn't martial—it was believing love could thrive on scarcity."

The yellow-robed woman's anger momentarily stilled. Du Teng met her gaze, decades of suppressed emotion cracking his stoicism. "I thought... by conquering the ultimate challenge, I could finally deserve you. Foolish pride."

Silence pooled around them, broken only by distant hoofbeats—two new challengers arriving, oblivious to the human drama unfolding at the inn's threshold.

Chapter 4125 You Truly Are Wood

Xiaorong stepped forward, bridal silks whispering. "Senior Sister, what will you do now?"

The woman lifted her chin. "Drag this stubborn ox away if need be. Let the Swordless Immortal wait another century for challengers."

Unexpectedly, Du Teng chuckled—a dry, rasping sound like wind through autumn reeds. "You haven't changed, Zhenxiang. Still the girl who barged into my thatched hut demanding why I hadn't proposed after three years' courtship."

"Because you were carved from millennia-old timber!" she retorted, but the old fondness in her epithet betrayed softening resolve.

Guanyu seized the opening. "Brother Du, the greatest cultivation is mastering one's own heart. Isn't facing this harder than any duel?"

For the first time, Du Teng's eyes gleamed with something besides resignation. He gazed at Zhenxiang as if truly seeing her—the silver threads in her hair no longer concealed by cultivation's grace, the worry lines etched by years of searching.

"You... waited?" The words emerged hoarse, disbelieving.

Zhenxiang's laugh held tears and triumph. "Fool. Love's timeline differs from mortal years. Nineteen winters? A mere heartbeat." Her hand rose, hesitant, then resolutely clasped his. "Come home. The only challenge left is growing old together."

As dawn's first light gilded the Swordless Inn's signboard, two figures departed westward—their shadows merging where the road forked towards distant mountains and humble hearths. Behind them, Guanyu murmured to Xiaorong: "Perhaps we've witnessed today's truest victory."

Xiaorong leaned into his shoulder. "Not every battle needs swords. Sometimes..." She smiled, watching the reunited pair disappear into golden mist. "...an open heart is the sharpest blade."
