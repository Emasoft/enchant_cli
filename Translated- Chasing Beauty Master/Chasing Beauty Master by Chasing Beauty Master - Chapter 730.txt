Guan Yu walked back to the stands with a rather striking gait. Teacher Guo stood up and announced, “This match goes to Guan Yu. Next will be the final contest of the day between Chen Tianxiao and Wei Yong. The loser will be immediately eliminated. 800[Books are almost all available here, much more stable than regular sites with faster updates, all text without ads.]”

“No need to compete. I’m no match for him. I can’t win at all.”

As soon as Teacher Guo finished speaking, Wei Yong walked out while speaking, exiting the basketball gym under the bewildered gazes of the crowd.

“Very well. Today’s winners have been decided. Guan Yu, Zhang Han, Chen Tianxiao, and Wang Hu will represent Kaihuang High School in the citywide taekwondo competition.”

After Teacher Guo’s announcement, Guan Yu curiously asked Chen Tianxiao beside him, “A citywide taekwondo competition? Isn’t it supposed to be between schools?”

“This was decided just a few days ago. Because the taekwondo competition in City A has garnered too much public attention, all schools are allowed to hire external reinforcements to ensure more exciting matches.”

Hearing Chen Tianxiao’s explanation, Guan Yu frowned. “External reinforcements? So we can just hire random experts from outside to help?”

“Exactly. As long as you have the means, you could even invite immortals down to assist.”

“Damn, then what’s the point of competing? The four of us aren’t enough to face their alliances. There’s always someone better out there. If experts exist among the populace, why isn’t our school hiring reinforcements?”

“I’m not sure either. Logically, with Kaihuang’s resources, hiring a high-level cultivator as reinforcement shouldn’t be difficult. Yet they’re forcing us four students to get beaten up. Who knows what the school administrators are thinking.”

Guan Yu shrugged. If he couldn’t figure it out, he wouldn’t dwell on it. At worst, he’d forfeit during the match—it wasn’t life-threatening.

After leaving school, Guan Yu turned and pointed at Zhang Han, threatening, “Stop following me. If you keep tailing me, I’ll report you for harassment and ulterior motives.”

“Hmph! Fine, I won’t follow. Big deal!” Zhang Han pouted, strutting to a sports car parked roadside before roaring off.

Guan Yu’s next task was to visit the Yang family to check on Patriarch Yang. He called Yang Conghan: “Hey, Yang Conghan, where are you?”

“I’m handling some matters at the club.”

“Come pick me up at Kaihuang. Let’s return to the Yang residence. I want to visit Patriarch Yang.”

Yang Conghan drove Guan Yu to the Yang estate. Yang Kunlun, having received advance notice, sat in the living room admiring his prized tea sets.

Guan Yu had little expertise in tea ceremonies and wasn’t particular about brews—he could take it or leave it.

Spotting Guan Yu, Yang Kunlun warmly greeted him from afar. “Ah, Guan Yu! What brings you here today? I’ve prepared a feast. Let’s eat and chat.”

“You’re too kind, Master Yang. Let’s dine first.”

“Hahaha! Straight to the point. Please, come!”

As Guan Yu followed Yang Kunlun to the dining hall, a familiar voice made him twitch his brows—Zhang Han had arrived again.

Bouncing into the room, Zhang Han froze upon seeing Guan Yu. “Y-You’re here too? Since when?”

Ignoring Yang Conghan and Yang Kunlun, she plopped down at the table and began stuffing a slice of meat into her mouth.

“Ah, Xiao Han, we have a guest. Mind your manners,” Yang Kunlun gently chided. His doting demeanor was evident—most aristocratic families would discipline a child for such rudeness.

“I’m just hungry! He’s not an outsider anyway,” Zhang Han mumbled through her full mouth.

“Alright, eat slowly.” Yang Kunlun turned to Guan Yu. “Don’t mind her, Guan Yu. This is Zhang Han. I’ve spoiled her rotten.”

“No worries. We’re acquainted. Earlier today, Zhang Han passed Kaihuang’s trials and will join the citywide taekwondo competition,” Guan Yu remarked casually.

Any family would adore such a spirited girl, and Zhang Han was no exception.

“Let’s eat first,” Yang Conghan interjected.

“Auntie, pass me that slice of meat!” The large dining table bore over twenty dishes, and Zhang Han couldn’t reach. After speaking, she covered her mouth, wide-eyed. “Oops, I slipped up.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “So Yang Conghan is your aunt? That makes you my niece, eh?”

“Exactly! By relation, Zhang Han is your niece,” Yang Kunlun affirmed with a laugh.

“Hmph! Niece it is, then. No big deal,” Zhang Han grumbled, annoyed at lowering her own status.

Yang Conghan caught Guan Yu’s implication. “What do you mean ‘your niece’?”

“Oh, nothing. Earlier at school, she claimed to be your sister and kept calling me ‘brother-in-law.’ Turns out you’re her aunt.”

**Chapter 1853: Diarrhea**

Guan Yu smirked. “So Yang Conghan is your aunt? That makes you my niece. Popular.”

“Precisely! By kinship, Zhang Han is your niece,” Yang Kunlun reiterated jovially.

“Ugh, niece it is! So what?” Zhang Han sulked, blaming herself for the blunder.

Yang Conghan pressed, “What’s this about her being your niece?”

“Nothing major. During today’s trials, she posed as your sister and addressed me as ‘brother-in-law.’ Now I learn you’re her aunt.”

“This girl! Always mischief, never a dull moment,” Yang Kunlun remarked fondly.

Zhang Han’s craving for meat had exposed her familial standing.

“Quick, call me ‘Uncle’!” Guan Yu teased.

“Uncle! Eat slowly—less might save you from diarrhea. Hmph! Annoying, getting demoted a generation,” Zhang Han huffed, sparking laughter around the table.

Over the meal, Guan Yu learned Zhang Han was an orphan, hence Yang Kunlun’s indulgence. Fifteen years prior, during chaotic clashes between major families, Zhang Han was born into turmoil. Her parents were assassinated shortly after her birth, and Yang Kunlun raised her.

Yang Kunlun recounted arriving too late to save her parents. Assassins had struck at night, assuming the silent infant nearby was dead. She’d survived because her parents sealed her meridians in desperation.

Guan Yu pitied Zhang Han’s tragic origins—orphaned from birth, explaining her eccentric temper. “Zhang Han trained relentlessly, mastering Yang family techniques to avenge her parents,” he deduced.

“Her cultivation is remarkable. At fifteen, she’s nearly a first-class superpower user, comparable to mid-upper Three Venerables.”

Guan Yu nodded. Such prowess at her age demanded either rare talent or burning resolve.

After examining Patriarch Yang, Guan Yu nodded approvingly. “He’s recovering well. I estimate he’ll awaken within three days.”

“Really? Father will wake in three days?” Yang Conghan gripped Guan Yu’s arm, shaking it excitedly.

“Ahem…” Zhang Han coughed pointedly, reminding her aunt to maintain decorum. Yang Conghan, always poised, had momentarily forgotten herself in joy.

Bidding the Yangs farewell, Guan Yu checked on Huaye Club before heading home.

A new Alon supercar sat in his driveway. “Damn! Xue Jing went all out. I just needed speed for emergencies, but this is overkill!”

The open window revealed Xue Jing and Amei chatting inside.

“Guan Yu, you’re back. Satisfied with the car?” Xue Jing asked.

Guan Yu nodded. “Needs modifications: raised chassis, exhaust cannons, and hidden dual pipes for speed and stealth.”

“I’ll arrange that tomorrow. List any other needs for the mechanics.”

The next day, Guan Yu attended classes amid an uneasy calm. The desk remained his favorite pillow—academics baffled him. In his current memory, he’d only finished elementary school. Were he younger, he’d restart from there.

During break after second period, four swaggering boys entered Class 1-3. One spiky-haired youth approached Guan Yu.

“You’re Guan Yu?”

“Yeah. What’s up?” Guan Yu lazily replied, fresh from sleep.

“I’m Xiao Gen, under Young Master Ran. He wants to meet you. Come.” Xiao Gen inwardly cursed—why send him to fetch this nobody? So he crippled Young Master Feng? That weakling deserved it.

Xiao Gen, real name Wei Youcai, was Ran Shao’s right-hand man. Since Feng Shao’s downfall, Ran Shao had founded the League of Heroes, rapidly recruiting disenchanted followers. Guan Yu, absent lately, learned this from Wei Hongwei that morning.

Meanwhile, Wang Bo’s Brotherhood recruited talent, even gifting 5,000 yuan to a subordinate Three Venerables member. Ran Shao, leveraging his Ran family’s prestige, outpaced them, nearing 100 members.

Both factions covertly vied for dominance, desperate for formidable recruits. Guan Yu’s recent victories made him a target.

Though unfamiliar with Ran Shao, Guan Yu disliked Xiao Gen’s arrogance. “Who’s Ran Shao?” Guan Yu asked pointedly, though everyone knew.

“Tell your boss to come himself if he wants a meeting.”

Xiao Gen glowered. “You dare disrespect Ran Shao?”

“His face isn’t that big.”

“Want us to carry you?” Xiao Gen clenched his fists.

Wei Hongwei shoved him. “Looking for a fight?”

Jia Bo loomed over them. “Who taught you to walk? Picking fights in the wrong place!”

Guan Yu approved their boldness.

“Fuck! Seems we gotta get rough!” another lackey blustered, sleeves rolled.

“Touch us, and the League will leave you crawling!”

Wei Hongwei lunged, but Guan Yu halted him. “Tell Ran Shao to show sincerity next time—and send someone better. Now scram.”

“Roll out!” Jia Bo roared.

“Guan Yu! Defying the League? You’ve got guts!”

“Showing off?” Guan Yu slapped Xiao Gen spinning. “Ten seconds to leave—or get carried out.”

Staggering, Xiao Gen spat blood. “Mark your words. We’ll see!”

“I tolerate everything but pretenders. Five seconds left.”

“Who dares threaten my man?” Xue Jing appeared, storming over. “Harm a hair on him, and I’ll skin you alive.”
