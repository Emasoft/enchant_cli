A series of questions continuously echoed in Gao Wei's mind. Curiously opening her eyes, she froze at the sight before her, as if struck by lightning. She murmured, "Guan Yu?"

Guan Yu stood before Gao Wei with a gentle smile. "I promised you I'd return," he said.

Gao Wei suddenly embraced him tightly, burying her face in his chest as tears blurred her vision. None knew how her heart had transformed during Guan Yu's absence, but one thing was clear - every thought had been tied to him.

From her lonely vigil on the hilltop to fleeing hungry wolves, Guan Yu had rooted himself irreplaceably in her heart. His sudden reappearance left her overwhelmed - this being their first true embrace.

Gently patting her back, Guan Yu teased, "Don't cry now. We still need to deal with the beast that made you weep."

As Gao Wei withdrew, wiping her eyes, Guan Yu pointed into the distance. "Look - the show's beginning."

What unfolded exceeded all imagination - the starving wolf now battled the same giant eagle that had carried Guan Yu away. The colossal bird circled its prey with lethal grace, talons flashing as it struck with surgical precision.

"Call it fate," Guan Yu explained. "Brother Hai here decided I'm worth befriending after I helped his sick fledgling."

Gao Wei's skeptical gaze met his earnest explanation of interspecies communication. Before she could question further, the battle crescendoed - a primal dance of feather and fang that held them spellbound.

When Hai Dongqing returned victorious with the wolf's carcass, Guanå®‡'s admiration grew. This majestic creature had protected them, yet now needed his help to save its dying chick.

As Guan Yu knelt by the ailing fledgling, an unexpected surge erupted from the ancient coin in his mind. The relic trembled violently, forging a new connection that left him breathless. Through the chaos, he maintained focus - this frail life depended on him now.

"Guan Yu!" Gao Wei's panicked voice pierced his trance. Sweating and pale, he pressed hands to the chick's chest and head, channeling his mysterious energy in desperation.

The coin's blue glow intensified as life hung in balance. In this moment between worlds, healer and patient became one - humanity's wisdom meeting nature's raw will to survive.
