Moreover, Zhenxiang could tell that Guan Yu had been holding back from the very beginning. During their close combat earlier, if Guan Yu had consistently unleashed Qi Slashes at such close range during unguarded moments, Du Teng would have been utterly defenseless. This was the crucial difference.

As the two halted their clash, Guan Yu emerged unscathed, while Du Teng stood disheveled with a wounded shoulder. Though baffled by his defeat and perplexed by Guan Yu's extraordinary prowess—alongside the unorthodox fighting style—Du Teng conceded wholeheartedly. "Younger brother," he declared, "you've won. Had you not shown mercy earlier, my head would already lie severed from my shoulders."

"Brother Du flatters me," Guan Yu chuckled, sheathing his blade. "It was your generosity in combat that allowed this outcome. Let us return to our drinks now that the contest concludes."

"Excellent! More wine!" Du Teng boomed with laughter.

As they approached the pavilion, applause echoed behind them. Turning, Guan Yu saw Prince Zou approaching with clapping hands. "Magnificent! Truly magnificent!" the prince exclaimed. "To witness such masters crossing blades—a rare privilege indeed!"

Guan Yu swiftly made introductions. "Brother Du, may I present my lord? My lord, this is Du Teng, a newfound brother-in-arms."

Though unaware of the prince's status, Du Teng cared only for camaraderie. "Your Excellency," he bowed, "witnessing your retainer's skill has enlightened this humble one. He stands peerless among warriors."

Prince Zou's astonishment extended to Lao Cang's earlier display—he nearly embraced the elderly servant upon realizing the hidden master safeguarding him. With such protection, what enemy could threaten him? Even Guan Yu's revealed capabilities left the prince—and all witnesses—astounded.

Young Zou Wuhui whispered to Zou Wuxiao, "Is this truly the Lao Cang we knew? That blade—have you ever seen its like before?" The latter could only shake his head mutely.

"You honor me unduly," Du Teng demurred to the prince. "I remain but Lao Cang's defeated challenger. Your household breeds true masters."

After exchanging pleasantries, Prince Zou departed. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi kept their distance, knowing Guan Yu's displayed skills barely scratched his capabilities—the Imperial Seal remained unused, firearms untouched.

Xiao Zhi marveled, "Excepting our sect master, who could oppose Guan Yu now? He's been at Cloud Azure Sect less than a year!"

"Xuánmíng?" Wang Jun smirked. "Don't take offense, but even our master would struggle against him now. He's transcended past limitations."

"Father always said he was a dual-cultivation prodigy destined for greatness," Xiao Zhi sighed. "But this progress... it defies belief."

"Cease envy," Wang Jun slung an arm around him. "We'll never match his stride. Let's stroll instead."

Resuming their seats, Guan Yu raised his cup. "Brother Du, I apologize for earlier presumption. To your health!"

Du Teng drank deeply, thoroughly humbled. Despite initial restraint, he'd fought full-force yet still lost decisively.

Zhenxiang tended Du Teng's shoulder wound—deep but bone-sparing—while chiding, "Didn't I warn you? Pride blinded you to Young Master Cang's superiority."

"Underestimated indeed," Du Teng admitted. "Your cultivation baffles me—your aura suggests lesser attainment than displayed."

Zhenxiang glanced at Wang Xiaorong, bound by secrecy, then whispered in Du Teng's ear: "He's a dual cultivator of magic and martial arts. This is merely his dawn—imagine his zenith."

Stunned beyond pain, Du Teng stared at Guan Yu. "Inconceivable... simply inconceivable!" He seized his cup anew. "Another toast, brother!"

They drank repeatedly until Zhenxiang intervened, citing Du Teng's injury. Guan Yu then inquired, "Sister-in-law, I perceive your immortal cultivation. May I ask your sect affiliation?"

"Disciple of Zhenyang Sect's 19th generation," Zhenxiang revealed. "Apprenticed to Vice-Sect Master Dehua."

Guan Yu's interest quickened—the elusive Zhenyang Sect, rarely seen in Jianghu! "I've met Elder Wang of your sect," he offered.

Zhenxiang deduced his Cloud Azure ties but respected the unspoken discretion. When questioned about Zhenyang's nomadic secrecy, she explained: "My master rescued me from a fall, deeming it fate. Five years training under him, yet I've never seen our sect headquarters. We exist... betwixt shadow and substance."

"Your sect hibernates," Guan Yu mused. "Gathering strength unseen. Perhaps surpassing even Cloud Azure's might."

"Speculation," Zhenxiang demurred. "But master speaks of an awakening era—when Zhenyang shall reemerge."

Du Teng, now thoroughly impressed, declared: "Given time, you might challenge even the Swordless Immortal! They say he too walks the dual path."

"Impossible," Guan Yu countered. "Millennia since such a cultivator emerged. Mere legend."

As debate continued, a newcomer approached—Xia Jian, Du Teng's neighbor. "Thought you'd be dead on that mountain by now!" he jeered.

"Changed plans," Du Teng shrugged. "You attempting the challenge?"

"Better death than cowardice," Xia Jian retorted, striding toward the perilous peak. Guan Yu noted the man's aura—at least Realm Venerable strength.

Elsewhere, three figures joined the ascent—including the disheveled-haired man who'd pinned flies with chopsticks that morning. All bore formidable cultivations.

"Chapter 4134: The Mysterious Sect" concluded as "Chapter 4136: No Reckless Moves" began, the stage set for converging fates at Swordless Manor's deadly slopes.
