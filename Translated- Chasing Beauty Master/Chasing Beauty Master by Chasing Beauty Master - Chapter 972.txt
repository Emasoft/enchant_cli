Chapter 2485: Resting When Tired

Fan Shuicai's broadsword pressed against Master Cheng's neck. After surveying the situation, Master Cheng had no choice but to surrender, not daring to make any rash moves.

Wei Hongwei arrived with his men in a grand procession from behind. Fan Shuicai said, "Brother Wei, your timing is perfect. I was worried we wouldn't capture this fellow before reaching the planned location. Your swift arrival is most fortunate. However, this net..."

The two comrades studied the large net ensnaring Master Cheng. This hadn't been part of their original plan, which only involved cornering Master Cheng here for a thorough beating before capture.

The sudden descent of this celestial net had spared them physical exertion while achieving better-than-expected results.

Jia Bo approached from another direction with his men, rubbing his nose as he chuckled: "This net was my specially prepared gift for him. Haha! How does it feel being trapped inside?"

Now a captive, Master Cheng growled, "My momentary lapse led me into your trap. Did you think you could capture my moth—"

"Enough of this horseshit!" Jia Bo cut him off. "Should've thought earlier about consequences! Men, take him away!"

At home, Guan Yu found himself teaching Amei yoga during their idle hours. The living room's central area featured an 1.8x2-meter woolen carpet where Amei practiced poses under his guidance.

The sudden ringing of Guan Yu's phone on the coffee table interrupted them. Seeing Wei Hongwei's caller ID, Guan Yu answered: "Calling so late? Did Yao Yao catch you red-handed again?"

"Boss, must you assume the worst?" Wei Hongwei's excited voice replied. "We've captured Master Cheng!"

Guan Yu paused in surprise. "Interrogation results?"

"We've confirmed his real name is Gao Bing. Surprisingly, he's the Fang Family's steward. Young Master Fang ordered him to recruit thugs targeting our Yu Gang members through ambushes."

"Send me your location."

After hanging up, Guan Yu called upstairs: "Jingjing! We're going out!"

Xue Jing bounded down from Zhang Han's room where she'd been gaming, fearing to miss their departure.

To Amei, Guan Yu said: "Rest if tired. We'll continue tomorrow."

Amei smiled sweetly. "Understood. Be safe tonight, you and Sister Jing."

Soon, Guan Yu and Xue Jing arrived at the abandoned construction site from days prior.

"Boss, this is Master Cheng—real name Gao Bing. After interrogation, he confessed being the Fang Family's steward," Wei Hongwei reported upon their arrival.

Nodding, Guan Yu approached the prisoner suspended by rope-bound wrists. Though lacking visible wounds, the man's bare feet showed bloody evidence of toenail removal.

"So you're Master Cheng? How many have you recruited against my gang?"

"Lost count. Many nightly recruits," Gao Bing answered meekly, his spirit broken by torture.

Guan Yu pressed: "Why does Young Master Fang target me?"

"Only know he paid me nightly to find Yu Gang enemies. Nothing more."

Though partially believing this, Guan Yu probed: "As Fang's steward, you must know their dirty secrets. Share them."

A wealthy family's steward—especially trusted relatives like Yang Family's cousin-steward or Lü Mei's uncle Wang Shu—typically knew dark secrets. Guan Yu sought leverage against the Fangs.

Gao Bing's silence prompted Guan Yu to tell Wei Hongwei: "Your interrogation seems incomplete. Perhaps more persuasion needed."

Xue Jing whispered: "Find less bloody methods, please?"

Remembering her nightmares after previous torture scenes, Guan Yu nodded. "Where's his phone?"

Jia Bo handed over the device. Finding Fang's number, Guan Yu dialed.

Chapter 2486: I Said Nothing

The Fang residence hosted Young Master Fang Su—renowned among A City's elite for his pretentiousness. Anxious about his steward's silence, Fang Su dismissed his masseuse when Guan Yu's call came.

"Uncle Gao! Why's your phone been—"

"Concerned about your steward?" Guan Yu's mocking voice interrupted. "He failed spectacularly. My men removed all his toenails—quite the sanguinary spectacle..."

"Guan Yu! How dare you touch my people!" Fang Su roared.

"I captured 'Master Cheng' for attacking my brothers. Through his... encouragement, I've learned fascinating Fang Family stories."

Gao Bing suddenly shouted: "Young Master! I revealed nothing!"

Jia Bo clubbed the prisoner into silence as Fang Su demanded: "What do you want?"

"Me?" Guan Yu feigned surprise. "You attacked my gang first. Did you tire of living? This won't end peacefully."

Fang Su's anxiety grew—Gao Bing was his maternal uncle and trusted steward. Though wealthy enough to defy most, Guan Yu's police connections complicated matters.

"Name your price," Fang Su ground out.

Consulting Jia Bo's injury list, Guan Yu declared: "Thirty minor injuries at 10,000 each, twenty serious at 100,000 each. Three million cash."

Jia Bo nearly trembled with excitement at the sum—knowing Guan Yu would share it.

"Extortion!" Fang Su shouted.

"Then let's involve police. Goodbye."

"Wait!" Fang Su relented. "Three million it is."

Guan Yu smiled—he'd inflated actual injuries (under ten, one serious). The money would upgrade their shabby headquarters and compensate the leg-fractured brother.

"Contact you later." Hanging up, Guan Yu eyed Gao Bing—clearly holding vital Fang secrets worth deeper interrogation.

Chapter 2487: Nonsense

After the call, Fang Su smashed his phone, swearing: "Guan Yu! You'll beg for death soon!"

Meanwhile at the site, Guan Yu considered tripling his demand upon Fang Su's quick compliance. This steward clearly knew explosive secrets.

To Gao Bing, Guan Yu said: "Your master values you at three million. Let's discuss what else you're worth..."
