Guan Yu forced a bitter smile and said, “Stop fooling around. Hurry and invite everyone inside.”

Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi were completely overlooked by the group. The girls immediately began bustling about – Lü Mei and Zhang Han pulled Guan Yu to sit down, while Amei and Xue Jing hurried to the kitchen for fruits. Others massaged his shoulders and legs, leaving no one idle.

Evidently, now that Guan Yu had returned, the number of women he brought back no longer mattered most.

Second Wolf made himself at home without ceremony. After sitting down, he grabbed a canned drink from the coffee table and gulped it contentedly.

“It’s been ages since I enjoyed such treatment. Home truly is best,” Guan Yu beckoned. “You two, stop standing there. Come sit. I’ll introduce everyone properly – from now on, we’re all family.”

Observing Guan Yu’s attire before glancing at Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, Lü Mei asked curiously, “Guan Yu, were you filming a period drama? Why are you dressed like this? And why keep wearing the costumes? You’re taking method acting too far.”

“It’s a long story. My return… let’s just say Heaven showed mercy,” Guan Yu replied.

Qiqi stood frozen beside Wang Xiaorong, both women staring wide-eyed at their surroundings. Everything here felt alien – the people, the objects, all utterly unfamiliar except for Guan Yu himself.

The chorus of women chattering around Guan Yu left the newcomers thoroughly bewildered. Qiqi whispered to Wang Xiaorong, “Sister Xiaorong… have we arrived in the Kingdom of Women?”

“I’m equally lost,” Wang Xiaorong murmured.

Thus two more girls joined Qiaoyuan District, strangers needing to learn everything anew. Yet harmony prevailed as they blended seamlessly into this cheerful, thriving community.
