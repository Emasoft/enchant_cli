Wang Wu did not spot the silver business vehicle Guan Yu had mentioned. He surmised it would arrive later – this guest must be someone extraordinary. Ensuring proper arrangements was crucial, lest future lucrative opportunities vanish.

Tongwei Hospital, the most prestigious medical institution in Yangcheng, teemed with patients and vehicles. Other hospitals paled in comparison.

Suddenly remembering an urgent matter, Wang Wu hurried back to the lobby to issue instructions.

Though underground parking existed, the congested lot required meticulous planning. Wang Wu demanded nearby VIP parking be reserved.

Understanding his intent, lobby staff immediately contacted security to vacate prime spots.

For ordinary visitors, finding parking here proved nearly impossible – even basement levels stayed packed. However, security always reserved emergency slots for distinguished guests.

Important figures coordinated arrivals beforehand, activating these ideal parking positions near main entrances for seamless access.

Returning roadside, Wang Wu spotted a silver Buick business van approaching. This had to be the one.

From afar, Guan Yu observed a thirty-something man in white coat and black leather shoes – slightly stubbled yet youthful.

Guan Yu mused – this must be Wang Wu. But why had Du Xiaojuan chosen someone so young? His boyish appearance hardly inspired medical authority. Typically, seasoned experts with receding hairlines and gleaming foreheads commanded trust.

As the van stopped at the gate, Wang Wu approached smiling. “Hello? Are you Mr. Guan?” He struggled to reconcile Guan Yu’s reputation with the poised young man before him – barely twenty yet radiating uncommon elegance.

**Chapter 3202: The Deposit**

Wang Wu privately speculated – *Could this be Ms. Du’s kept lover? Likely. Why else would she personally contact me?* He nodded imperceptibly, convinced of his theory.

“Correct. Shouldn’t we prioritize the patient’s examination?” Guan Yu responded, noting Wang Wu’s distracted nodding.

“Yes, yes! Everything’s prepared – parking, medical team. Please follow me.” Wang Wu led them through security gates toward the main building.

Despite Tongwei’s sprawling compound with rear courtyards and southern underground parking, surface lots overflowed. Near the building’s entrance, a security guard vacated a reserved spot upon seeing Wang Wu.

Medical staff waited with stretchers. Guan Yu smiled approvingly. “Impressive coordination. They’ve even mobilized doctors and equipment. Saves us effort.”

After parking, Guan Yu addressed Wang Wu. “Doctor Wang, my friend has critical fever. Please diagnose promptly.”

“Of course.” Wang Wu directed orderlies to transfer the unconscious uncle inside.

Turning to Guan Yu, Wang Wu advised, “Admission procedures are complete. Present this form at the first-floor deposit window.”

Guan Yu nodded – covering expenses was expected. The aunt anxiously touched her pocket. Her meager savings, barely sufficient for travel, couldn’t begin to cover hospital fees.

“Doctor…how much deposit is needed?” she reluctantly inquired.

“Five thousand to ten thousand is standard,” Wang Wu replied.

The aunt staggered, saved from falling only by Qiaoqiao’s steadying arm. The astronomical sum echoed in her mind – unimaginable for village life where barter sufficed. Her plastic bag contained barely 400 yuan in crumpled bills and coins.

Trembling, she offered her pitiful savings. Wang Wu stared at the jumbled coins and worn notes – mostly dimes and quarters beneath ten-yuan bills. Was this some cruel joke?

Guan Yu intervened. “Auntie, I’ll handle expenses.”

Qiaoqiao urged, “Put that away. Guan Yu’s got this.”

“But…it’s too much…I can’t repay…” Tears streamed down the aunt’s face. Village traditions haunted her – fever victims deemed possessed, condemned to burial.

“Take him back to the village!” she pleaded desperately.

Qiaoqiao countered, “They’ll bury Uncle! We can’t!”

**Chapter 3204: Returning Home**

Wang Wu interjected, “Mr. Guan, our finest resources will be deployed. I can advance the deposit if needed.”

“Unnecessary. My associate is handling it,” Guan Yu dismissed. After Wang Wu left, Guan Yu instructed Zhijieyu Lang to replenish the deposit, anticipating extended treatment.

Proposing a caretaker, Guan Yu prepared to depart. “Qiaoqiao, I’m returning to Yunqing Mountain with Siqi. Stay or come?”

The private room’s two beds limited occupancy. Qiaoqiao, noting Siqi’s proximity to Guan Yu, decided, “I’ll accompany you. Aunt and Xiaozhu can manage here.”

The aunt urged, “Take Xiaozhu too. She’s young…troublesome…”

“No! I stay with Mama!” Xiaozhu clung to her mother.

Guan Yu reassured, “She’s like my sister. I’ll protect her.”

Tearfully, the aunt considered offering Xiaozhu as repayment but couldn’t voice it. “Obey Guan Yu,” she told her daughter.

**Chapter 3205: Accommodating Requests**

The uncle stirred weakly, having overheard discussions. “Thank you…heard everything…”

Wang Wu returned in casual attire. “Any further needs, Mr. Guan?”

“Diagnosis timeline?”

“Blood results tomorrow. Full examination within a week. We’ll determine surgery then. Rest assured – I guarantee success.”

As the group prepared to leave for dinner, the uncle murmured gratitude before drifting asleep. Qiaoqiao’s watchful eyes tracked Siqi, resolved to safeguard her claim on Guan Yu’s attention. The hospital’s fluorescent lights hummed over this intricate dance of duty, devotion, and delicate social maneuvering.
