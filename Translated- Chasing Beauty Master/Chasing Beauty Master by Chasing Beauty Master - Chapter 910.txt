“That may be so, but the current problem is we don’t know where the Feng Family has hidden the Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Realm. Last time, I discovered a secret chamber in the basement of the Feng Family’s South Building. After exerting Herculean efforts to open it, the box inside turned out to be empty. I almost got trapped in that chamber myself.”

Guanyu paused before continuing, “It seems the Feng Family long anticipated my interest in the Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Realm and moved it beforehand. Now we’re left without a single clue.”

“I refuse to believe this!” Second-to-Wolf blurted thoughtlessly. “When I return, I’ll capture Young Master Feng, beat him half to death, and see if he still refuses to reveal the Demonic Realm’s location. That spineless weakling couldn’t withstand my fists!”

Jinhua and Guanyu simultaneously shook their heads and sighed, their gazes toward Second-to-Wolf resembling those directed at an utter fool.

“What’s with those looks? Explain yourselves!” Second-to-Wolf demanded indignantly.

“Your plan won’t work,” Jinhua replied with an amused smile. “Otherwise, Guanyu would have already captured Young Master Feng.”

Guanyu added, “If such crude methods sufficed, would I have waited until now? Currently, I’m the Feng Family’s primary adversary. Firstly, Young Master Feng never leaves his residence—capturing him would be extraordinarily difficult. Even if you seized him during one of his rare outings, have you considered retaliation from the Bill Family?

Even if the Bills don’t pursue you directly, Patriarch Feng would surely beg their assistance to target me for harming his heir. The Fengs would immediately assume I’m responsible for any misfortune befalling Young Master Feng. I’ve no desire to provoke such catastrophic consequences.”

“So the Fengs are untouchable?” Second-to-Wolf pressed, rubbing his temples.

“Not entirely,” Guanyu said calmly. “My forces are currently maneuvering against the Bill Family in secret. The day will come when I eliminate both factions together—but now isn’t the time.”

The Bill Family’s immense power demanded careful strategy. Guanyu intended to uncover their vulnerabilities through covert means before launching any overt assault.

After pondering, Second-to-Wolf proposed, “Could the Fengs have entrusted the Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Realm to the Bill Family for safekeeping? Wouldn’t that enhance its security?”

Guanyu shook his head. “Impossible. During my previous confrontation with Young Master Feng, I pressed him about the Demonic Realm’s location. Though terrified, he seemed genuinely ignorant.

I believe Patriarch Feng alone manages the Demonic Realm’s placement—likely keeping even his son uninformed. As the Fengs’ most vital treasure tied to their clan’s survival, he’d never casually entrust it to outsiders like the Bills.”

Jinhua nodded in agreement. “Our only options are to either steal the Demonic Realm or seize it after locating its hiding spot, then weather the Fengs’ retaliation. Brutal interrogations would prove futile. Despite their fragile appearance, even the typically timid Young Master Feng becomes unyielding regarding this matter.”

Chapter 2,328: My Speculation

Jinhua continued, “Excessive speculation helps little. Our priority remains uncovering the Demonic Realm’s location. As Jinhua said, direct force won’t work—we need subtle probing.

Here’s an idea: Young Master Feng enjoys carnal pleasures. What if we plant women near him to extract information? With such spies by his side, nothing would escape our notice. They’d serve as mobile surveillance cameras, documenting his every move!”

Second-to-Wolf chuckled triumphantly at his “brilliant” scheme, but Guanyu immediately dismissed it.

“The concept seems sound but proves impractical. Through my dealings with Young Master Feng, I’ve learned he strictly separates his dalliances from serious matters. Despite his dissolute appearance, he’s cunningly vigilant.

His women are confined to a dedicated recreation room—he never brings them to strategic discussions. Distrustful by nature, he relies on few confidants. Even surrounding him with a hundred beauties during crucial moments would achieve nothing.

He mistrusts even the Fengs’ most loyal stewards. Why would he confide in transient lovers? Moreover, his lack of principles paradoxically makes him acutely cautious when clarity matters most. No seductress could break his defenses.”

Having clashed with Young Master Feng repeatedly, Guanyu understood the man’s temperament thoroughly. Second-to-Wolf’s plan stood no chance.

Chapter 2,329: Such a Blockhead

“Victory will inevitably belong to Guanyu in this clash of titans,” Jinhua declared, gazing adoringly at Guanyu. “I can’t imagine anyone defeating him.” Second-to-Wolf made exaggerated gagging motions at their display.

Guanyu had grown accustomed to such admiration, his position as revered leader making it commonplace.

After their lengthy dinner, Guanyu stopped Acai from resuming cultivation drills. “Progress requires patience. You’ve trained relentlessly for two days—rest tonight. Consolidate your foundations through steady advancement, not rushed shortcuts.”

Acai nodded gratefully. “Understood. Thank you, Elder Brother.”

As Guanyu patted Acai’s shoulder, the mansion’s landline rang—an unusual occurrence. Examining the Western phone number, Guanyu answered in fluent English: “Hello. Who’s calling?”

A woman’s voice replied in English, “Guanyu, are you free? I need to discuss something.”

“You?” Recognition dawned. Checking the time, Guanyu agreed, “Name the place.”

Jinhua, initially curious about the mysterious caller, immediately identified the woman upon hearing Guanyu’s response. Pouting, she retreated.

As Guanyu prepared to leave, Jinhua adjusted his collar. “Return early.”

Surprised, Guanyu asked, “You knew I was going out?”

“Of course.” Jinhua smiled slyly. “Did you think you could hide it from me?”

Guanyu awkwardly explained, “It’s likely urgent business...”

“No explanations needed.” Jinhua kissed his cheek. “I trust you completely.”

After instructing Second-to-Wolf and Acai to guard Jinhua vigilantly, Guanyu departed.

Once gone, Second-to-Wolf probed, “Late-night caller—must be a woman. Who else would he rush to meet?”

“Half-correct,” Jinhua replied. “It’s Feng Xihu—Young Master Feng’s sister. Though I’m concerned...”

“Feng Xihu? How can you be sure?”

“A guess,” Jinhua said airily.

Second-to-Wolf rolled his eyes. “Guesswork? Could be Lady Laili!”

“Impossible. Lady Laili would contact his mobile, not this landline. Feng Xihu works at the police station—she could easily obtain this number. The evidence points conclusively to her.”

Second-to-Wolf grudgingly admired her deduction. “Impressive reasoning! You’d make an excellent detective.”

Jinhua preened momentarily before worrying aloud: “Last time Feng Xihu trapped Guanyu at the Feng Estate. What if this is another scheme? Second Brother, follow him secretly!”

“My orders are to protect you,” Second-to-Wolf stubbornly refused.

After fruitless arguments, Jinhua tried luring him: “Take me along! Acai can guard the house.”

“Discipline forbids it,” Second-to-Wolf stated, unmoved.

Realizing his unshakable resolve, Jinhua abandoned persuasion. “Fine! I’m retiring.”

As she flounced upstairs, Second-to-Wolf muttered, “Don’t play mind games with me, girl.”

Chapter 2,330: Close Ties

Guanyu drove to the police station near Lady Laili’s residence, where Feng Xihu awaited.

“Let’s get supper,” he offered.

Nodding silently, Feng Xihu directed him to a nearby eatery.

“Working late?” Guanyu inquired.

“Thanks to your human trafficking exposé,” she replied tonelessly. “The global spotlight forces meticulous round-the-clock interrogations.”

Her uncharacteristic calm puzzled Guanyu. Normally volatile around him, tonight’s detachment felt unnatural...
