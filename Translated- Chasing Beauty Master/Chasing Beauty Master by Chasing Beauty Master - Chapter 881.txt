After Xue Jing ran upstairs, she found Zhang Han and Lü Mei still engrossed in their game, showing no intention of coming downstairs. Furious, she barged into Zhang Han’s room and whispered, “Guan Yu’s friends are here to see him downstairs, and that middle-aged woman is Qing Linger’s (Spirit Child) mother. Shouldn’t you both go down to greet them? Do you want to get scolded?”

“Don’t distract me, Sister Jingjing! I’m fighting a boss right now. I’ll skip the meal—you go ahead,” Zhang Han retorted irritably, one small hand gripping the mouse while the other stuffed potato chips into her mouth, as if completely ignoring Xue Jing’s words.

Lü Mei remained motionless. Xue Jing seethed with quiet anger but dared not raise her voice, fearing Qing Linger and her mother might overhear. “Fine, I’ll tell Guan Yu. Let’s see how long you keep playing!”

“Oh! Linger brought her mother? I should go down immediately!” Lü Mei suddenly sprang to her feet, finally reacting. Zhang Han, hearing Xue Jing’s threat, also scrambled up. Half a month’s worth of snacks—far more important than any boss—hung in the balance. Xue Jing shook her head helplessly. These two were hopeless.

Not seeing Yang Conghan, Xue Jing guessed she must be in Guan Yu’s room. Sure enough, Yang Conghan was there chatting with him. “Guan Yu, Linger and her mother are here to visit you. They’re waiting downstairs.”

True to her refined upbringing, Yang Conghan immediately stood. “They’re here? I’ll go greet them first.” She knew both Qing Linger and her mother well, as Madam Qing occasionally visited the Flower Night Club to check on her daughter.

“They’re here? But I can’t move. Have them come up,” Guan Yu said, surprised that the frail Madam Qing had traveled so far to see him.

“I’ll have them eat some fruit downstairs first before bringing them up,” Xue Jing replied before leaving. In the hall, she heard Madam Qing profusely thanking Yang Conghan for looking after Linger.

“Linger, tell your mother not to stand on ceremony. We’re family,” Yang Conghan urged, eventually resorting to having Linger intervene when her own reassurances failed.

“We truly owe you our gratitude, especially to Brother Guan. Without your help, our family would have been destroyed long ago,” Linger added.

After exhausting her store of thanks, Madam Qing finally settled into her seat. Though her attire seemed rustic, her warm personality charmed the girls. They found her deeply maternal.

Guan Yu’s women, all from wealthy families, were remarkably kindhearted and egalitarian. None looked down on the less fortunate. The Yang and Lü families alone donated staggering sums annually to charity. Lü Mei frequently volunteered at nursing homes and impoverished villages, her compassion mirroring Guan Yu’s own.

Returning downstairs, Xue Jing smiled. “Auntie, we’re all family here. Please, enjoy some fruit.”

“Yes, yes,” Madam Qing accepted the fruit, adding, “Today has been eye-opening. I always thought my daughter the most beautiful woman alive, but after seeing you all…” She shook her head in wonder. “You’re like celestial maidens descended from heaven—each uniquely breathtaking. Even an old woman like me is captivated!”

She marveled at their perfection, as if painted by a master artist. Privately, she realized why Guan Yu hadn’t pursued Linger more actively. While Linger’s beauty matched theirs, she lacked their cultivated poise.

Had Madam Qing known these women had followed Guan Yu here, her astonishment would have doubled. Surveying the luxurious villa, she grasped Guan Yu’s wealth. Such a grand home for so few residents seemed extravagant.

“Auntie, Guan Yu is waiting upstairs. Shall we go see him?” Xue Jing suggested.

“Of course. Oh, I wanted to bring gifts, but Linger insisted otherwise. How improper to visit a patient empty-handed!” Madam Qing complained.

“Mother, look around. What could we possibly bring that he needs?” Linger countered. During their journey, she’d repeatedly stopped her mother from buying presents, arguing their futility. Now, seeing the opulent surroundings, Madam Qing understood.

Chapter 2255: The Jinx

Supported by Linger and Xue Jing, Madam Qing ascended to Guan Yu’s room. He awaited them bedridden, a necessary informality. “Auntie Qing, you shouldn’t have traveled so far! Linger, you should have dissuaded her.”

“You were injured protecting us. Even from abroad, I’d have come. Besides,” Madam Qing smiled, seating herself, “this was Linger’s idea. She cares deeply for you.”

“Mother!” Linger flushed, nudging her.

“Why be shy? He’s like family,” Madam Qing chuckled. Guan Yu noted she’d aged markedly since their last meeting—undoubtedly from the stress of her husband’s worsening condition. His recurrent snake venom attacks caused excruciating pain, tormenting both husband and wife.

“You shouldn’t have troubled yourself, Auntie,” Guan Yu said gently. “Linger, come alone next time.”

“Next time? What ‘next time’? Don’t jinx it!” Linger chided tearfully.

“Of course. I’ll visit Uncle Qing once recovered. How is he?”

Madam Qing’s smile froze. “He… he’s failing. The latest attack two days ago… I feared he wouldn’t survive…” Her voice broke as tears streamed down.

“He’ll pull through,” Guan Yu reassured. Xue Jing handed tissues, her own eyes moist.

“You’re all such good children,” Madam Qing wept, scrubbing her face fiercely. “Knowing you brings me joy.”

“Mother, today’s about visiting Brother Guan. Please,” Linger pleaded, tears falling despite her efforts.

“I’ll find a cure, Auntie. I swear it,” Guan Yu vowed. The decent old man didn’t deserve such suffering.

As Madam Qing composed herself, Guan Yu sensed unspoken words. “Please speak freely. I’ll help however I can.”

Clutching Linger’s hand, Madam Qing revealed her purpose: “I beg you to take Linger as your wife.” She placed a bank card on the bedside—Linger’s entire savings. “This pittance means nothing to you, but… please give her a home.”

“Mother! Why?” Linger cried, tugging her sleeve. Other women, drawn by commotion, gathered at the door.

“Enough! You’re not a child. Don’t tell me you disdain him?” Madam Qing snapped—a first toward her daughter. Linger recoiled, stunned.

The clever girl grasped the subtext. “What’s wrong? Is it Father?”

Madam Qing crumbled. “Your father… he’s dying. If he goes… I’ll follow.” Sobs wracked her frame.

Chapter 2256: Hidden Motives

Linger’s suspicion confirmed: her father’s venom had reached critical stages. Guan Yu understood—this wasn’t about money or resources, but an incurable ailment beyond even his power.

“Auntie, let’s discuss solutions together,” Guan Yu urged gently, the room heavy with shared grief. Only Zhang Han remained detached, munching snacks obliviously.

Madam Qing’s resolve hardened through tears. “I’ve decided. After her father… passes, I… I can’t go on. Linger needs—” Her voice failed.

“No! You can’t—” Linger began, but Guan Yu interjected calmly, “Auntie, as Linger’s sworn brother, I’ll always protect her. But there must be another way.”

The old woman shook her head hopelessly. In this mansion of jewel-like women, her daughter seemed a dull pebble. Yet desperation drove her plea. “Just… let her stay here. Even as a maid—”

“Never!” Linger cried. “I won’t abandon you!”

The stalemate hung until Guan Yu spoke with quiet authority: “We’ll find a cure. I promise.” But in his heart, uncertainty gnawed. Some battles even he couldn’t win.
