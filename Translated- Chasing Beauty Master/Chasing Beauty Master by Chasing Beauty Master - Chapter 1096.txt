“After Second to Wolf’s words, Xue Jing fell momentarily speechless. Second to Wolf continued, ‘Jingjing, I know I shouldn’t be troubling you like this, but I feel this situation is unfair to you. You’ve risked life and limb alongside him day after day, yet gained nothing in return. It’s time to demand your due.’

Though Second to Wolf was clearly sowing discord, Xue Jing remained unmoved. ‘Brother Second,’ she said, ‘aren’t you afraid these words might reach Yingzi? You know how vindictive Guanyu can be. I’m certain Yingzi will hear of this before nightfall.’

‘Don’t use Yingzi to threaten me!’ Second to Wolf retorted, desperation coloring his voice. ‘I’m practically destitute here! Besides, I’m speaking up for your interests. Guanyu hoards wealth yet gives you nothing – it’s intolerable!’ He continued advocating vehemently for Xue Jing’s cause.

Exasperated, Xue Jing relented, ‘Enough. I won’t demand money from Guanyu. My thoughts align with his now. It seems I must consult Yingzi about this.’

Second to Wolf paled, knowing Yingzi’s wrath would be unavoidable if she learned of tonight’s conversation. While he could argue against Guanyu’s accusations, combined testimony from Xue Jing would leave him defenseless.

‘Must we be so formal?’ he deflected. ‘It’s not that I refuse to help. I simply resent how Guanyu reaps all benefits while I do the heavy lifting. How is that fair?’ His complaint carried genuine frustration.

The truth emerged – Second to Wolf sought leverage over Guanyu, who persistently denied him such advantage. Thus, the former used noncooperation as his bargaining chip.

Seizing the perfect moment, Guanyu retrieved his phone and dialed Yingzi. ‘Yingzi? Finished dinner?’ he asked cheerfully.

‘Just ate with Amei!’ came Yingzi’s delighted reply. ‘I cooked a dish tonight – she said it was quite good!’

‘Excellent. Regarding your brother—’ Guanyu began, only to be interrupted by Second to Wolf’s panicked outburst: ‘Guanyu! Have you no honor? Hang up this instant!’

Ignoring him, Guanyu continued, ‘Your brother’s here with me. We’re dining out, but he—’

Before he could finish, Second to Wolf snatched the phone and disconnected. ‘You’d send me to my grave!’ he hissed. ‘If Yingzi learns of this, she’ll have my head!’

‘Really?’ Guanyu feigned innocence. ‘I merely sought counsel for my troubles.’

Slumping back, Second to Wolf muttered, ‘I thought myself shameless, but you surpass even me.’

‘Pot calling the kettle black,’ Guanyu chuckled.

‘In all my years as an assassin,’ Second to Wolf lamented, ‘I’ve never worked pro bono – until you. Since meeting you—’

The phone rang again with Yingzi’s caller ID. Knowing avoidance would worsen matters, Second to Wolf surrendered. ‘I’ll help against the Feng family... unconditionally.’ He handed back the phone bitterly.

Guanyu answered to Yingzi’s curious inquiry: ‘What was Brother doing earlier? Why hang up?’

‘Chapter 2803: Familiarizing with the Environment

‘Just jokes between us,’ Guanyu assured. Yingzi requested he pass along her regards, declining further conversation to avoid interrupting their meal.

Hanging up, Guanyu remarked, ‘How sensible Yingzi is. If only others emulated her wisdom, we’d save considerable time.’

Second to Wolf devoured his meal in sullen silence as Xue Jing chided their childish rivalry. Guanyu, deciding to mollify tensions, proposed a drinking bout which Second to Wolf eagerly accepted.

Though outmatched in alcohol tolerance, Guanyu drank strategically. Their prolonged revelry lasted until Xue Jing grew drowsy.

The next morning, Poison Widow found the Feng residence accommodations satisfactory. Leading Yuan Shanding and his wife Jiu Biyun out early, she aimed to reclothe their group and familiarize them with the locale.

Yuan objected to using Feng family guard uniforms for operations, citing visibility concerns. Poison Widow countered they needed discreet attire. Beyond shopping, critical reconnaissance of the area’s layout was required.

At a mall adjacent to Ma Tong’s casino, Jiu Biyun marveled at the bustling crowds – her first metropolitan experience. After purchasing essentials, Poison Widow suggested distributing funds for individual purchases under Feng escorts, combining errands with environmental familiarization.

As Poison Widow briefed Yuan on local protocols, he inquired about opening a shop. Dismissing small commerce as unprofitable, she reiterated recruitment offers into her Shadow Sun organization for lucrative operations.

Chaos erupted when Jiu discovered her missing wallet containing substantial cash. Retracing steps to a clothing store, Yuan took advantage of the search to grope a comely clerk, triggering screams and threats of police involvement.

Poison Widow intervened, bribing the clerk after confirming surveillance evidence. As they hastily departed, the clerk retrieved Jiu’s ‘lost’ wallet from under a counter, pocketing both the hush money and stolen cash with satisfaction.

The trio’s retreat masked Yuan’s mixture of embarrassment and lingering arousal. Poison Widow’s exasperation warred with pragmatic damage control, while Jiu simmered with unspoken resentment. The incident underscored their cultural dislocation – hill dwellers unprepared for urban norms, where momentary indiscretions carried legal repercussions far beyond mountain village gossip.
