“Well, well! So-called ‘forced by circumstances’? Fine then, I won’t force you anymore. Get lost! Go find your Brother Locke!”

Bika Cat wore an aggrieved expression. “I’d love to change masters, but alas, once I Bika Cat pledge loyalty, I’d rather die than switch owners!”

“Then shut your trap, wretched feline! Always boosting others’ morale while dampening our own. Can’t you utter a single auspicious word?”

The cat sulked momentarily before perking up. “Boss! Remember that incomplete cultivation manual we bought from the Golden Auction House?”

The reminder struck Guan Yu. He did possess a Heaven-tier technique manual, albeit fragmentary. Better than nothing, at least.

Retrieving a crumpled book from his robes, its ordinary appearance belied staggering value—100,000 gold coins. Such wealth could sustain common folk for lifetimes across the Blue Beauty Continent.

Handling the manual with reverent care, Guan Yu recalled a crucial point: fragmented Heaven-tier techniques preserved on scrolls were usually unique editions. Mastering its contents could grant peerless abilities—no counters existing in the world.

Excitement surged through him. To wield an unparalleled technique! Yet upon opening the tattered pages, his hopes deflated. The esoteric script resembled celestial gibberish.

“Seems I overestimated myself. Forget cultivation—I can’t even comprehend the text!”

“Don’t despair, Boss,” Bika interjected. “Your magical breakthroughs are impressive, but you’re illiterate in arcane languages. We need someone fluent in magical scripts.”

“Magical linguists?” Guan Yu snapped his fingers. “The entire elf tribe qualifies!”

To verify, he sought Princess Amy. As he opened his door, the elf girl tumbled in unexpectedly.

“Since when were you here?” Guan Yu startled. Had she been eavesdropping?

Amy shuffled guiltily, hands clasped behind her back. Her furtive manner heightened Guan Yu’s suspicion.

Before he could interrogate, she blurted nervously: “Brother Longzu... I... have a favor to ask...”

Her uncharacteristic hesitation put Guan Yu on guard. “Out with it, imp.”

“I’ll only tell if you promise first!”

“Fine, granted. Speak.”

Amy leaped into his arms, squealing delight: “Brother Longzu! You’re the best!”

Only then did Guan Yu notice her nightgown. The flimsy garment accentuated her petite figure, lending unintended allure to the adolescent elf.

He hastily disentangled himself. “Get down! Midnight rendezvous between unmarried youths—how improper!”

Amy scoffed, “Only impure minds taint innocence. The fault lies with your thoughts.”

“You—” Guan Yu choked on retorts. To think she viewed him thus!

Chapter 1342: The Talking Cat

Clearing his throat, Guan Yu warned, “If you persist in nonsense, Amy, I’ll rescind my promise.”

The elf clung to his arm, wheedling: “Don’t be mean! You’re kindest to Amy, right?”

Her legendary pout—even Elven Chief Alan couldn’t withstand it. Guan Yu surrendered: “Jesting! Your noble Dragon Brother keeps promises. What brings our lady here?”

Batting lashes, Amy pointed at the meditating cat: “I want it to sleep with me!”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “Absolutely not!”

“Liar! You promised!”

Unmoved, Guan Yu glanced at Bika—a grown man’s psyche in feline form. Allowing this with an elven maiden? Unthinkable.

Snatching the cat, he hissed: “Refuse her, or become tomorrow’s stew!”

Bika mewled pitifully. Though prone to mischief, nocturnal escapades with the elf terrified him. Yet Amy’s persistence required Guan Yu’s intervention.

“Daytime play only, Amy. Nights it stays here.”

“Why?” The clueless elf pouted. “It’s just a cat! You’re stingy!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Truth is... it’s no ordinary cat.”

Amy brightened. “Oh! You mean it’s extra cuddly? Perfect hand-warmer!”

“No! Bika’s a magical beast from Death Valley!”

“Wow! Even better! I’m not scared—lend him!”

Defeated, Guan Yu turned away. Silence lingered until sniffles revealed tearful Amy.

“Mean Brother! Won’t share kitty...”

As Guan Yu panicked at her sobs, Bika stretched lazily. “My intervention’s required.”

When the cat spoke, Amy’s tears vanished. Staring wide-eyed, she whispered: “Who... spoke?”

Guan Yu jabbed at Bika. “The damned cat.”

“Damned? I’m the universe’s handsomest Bika Cat!” The feline struck a pose.

Amy’s sorrow transformed into peals of laughter. Guan Yu facepalmed. “That’s what amuses you?”

Ignoring him, Amy marveled: “Kitty! How can you talk? First speaking cat ever!”

“Address me properly—Bika Cat, Supreme Feline! Not ‘kitty,’ brat!”

Amy’s tiny fist sent him tumbling. “I’m Lady Amy! Respect!”

Watching their antics, Guan Yu sighed. “Apparently, I’m the third wheel here.”

Chapter 1343: Great Imprisoning Heaven Finger

After prolonged chatter, Guan Yu urged: “Amy, bedtime. Now you know Bika’s no pet. No shared sleeping.”

The elf acquiesced, though burning with curiosity: “Why can he talk?”

Guan Yu evaded: “He enjoys talking.”

“Liar!” Amy turned to Bika: “Truth, kitty!”

The cat dodged her approach. “Dunno! Maybe Boss taught me!”

Betrayed, Amy stormed out but was halted. “Wait. Need your help.”

Presenting the scroll, Guan Yu bargained: “Assist me, and I’ll grant requests.”

Amy’s eyes lit recognizing the Heaven-tier manual. “The auction prize! That costly scroll!”

Guan Yu winced at the reminder. “Help decipher this.”

“Hah! You’re illiterate?!”

“Testing you!” Guan Yu bluffed before confessing: “Keep this secret!”

Amy’s giggles subsided as she read aloud: “Great Imprisoning Heaven Finger.”

Goosebumps erupted on Guan Yu. The name alone radiated power.

Though Amy translated portions, the fragmented profound text defied comprehension. Resigned, Guan Yu shelved the manual.

Bika observed: “Boss, literal interpretation’s unnecessary. Remember martial arts films? Masters grasp essence beyond words.”

“Life’s not cinema!”

“Suit yourself.” The cat yawned. “Your problem.”

Alone, Guan Yu reopened the manual. The Great Imprisoning Heaven Finger—its secrets waiting to be unleashed.
