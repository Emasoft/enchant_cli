Though reluctant to perform the ceremonial bow, Guan Yu complied for the sake of his purpose. After paying respects, the Emperor inquired, “So you are Wan Hong? Your reputation has resounded through the capital these days. Even the Grand Princess and the Junzhu often speak of you.”

“Merely the result of everyone’s undeserved kindness,” Guan Yu replied coolly. “This humble merchant is unremarkable.”

The Emperor continued, “We’ve heard of your recent assistance to the Crown Prince in the capital—how you advised him and earned his effusive praise. Even Prince Zou mentioned your pivotal role in rescuing Junzhu Jiang Xin. Today’s summons is simple: We wish to reward you. Name your desire.”

Guan Yu considered this fortunate. An imperial reward surpassed anything the Crown Prince could offer. “Your Majesty’s grace humbles me. If I may choose, I would ask for that stone.” He pointed to a white gem nearby.

The gem intrigued him. Its surface bore four characters—*Longevity as the Heavens*—with golden specks flowing like the patterns of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, a martial art Guan Yu had encountered twice before. The stone’s connection to this esoteric method compelled his curiosity.

**Chapter 4980: Too Excited to Sleep**

“Oh? This?” The Emperor chuckled. “A discerning choice. The Second Prince presented this gem mere days ago.”

Realizing the stone’s inscription implied it was a treasured gift, Guan Yu retreated. “Forgive my presumption, Your Majesty. Any reward at your discretion would suffice.” Though denied, he resolved to investigate the gem later. Its link to the Eight-Sided Drum Technique and its sheer size—a rarity among low-grade spirit stones—suggested monumental value, worthy of a sect’s ancestral treasure.

The Emperor nodded. “Fear not. Our promise of reward stands.”

As Guan Yu listened to the Emperor and Crown Prince converse, his attention lingered on the gem. From afar, its surface resembled a glass casing enclosing liquid white jade, the golden characters swirling within.

Later, at the inn, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi bombarded him with questions about the palace. Guan Yu diverted them: “Prepare our stealth attire. The Emperor’s birthday approaches, and the palace bustles with preparations. Tonight, we investigate something intriguing.”

“What intrigue? I’m coming!” Qiqi exclaimed.

“Precisely why I’ll take you both. But first, adjust your attire.”

Qiqi vibrated with excitement, donning a modified black outfit. Wang Xiaorong, though unskilled in tailoring, had trimmed her own clothes to fit the girl. Bound sleeves and hems completed the disguise.

“We’ll explore the palace tonight,” Guan Yu declared. “A rare sight awaits—one I’d have missed without the Emperor’s invitation.”

When Qiqi asked about the promised reward, he shrugged. “I redirected any gold or jewels to the Crown Prince for northern disaster relief. Material things burden a traveler.”

Wang Xiaorong frowned. “Can his men be trusted? Greed might divert the shipments.”

“A fair concern. I’ll suggest Hong Ren oversee it—a principled man, despite his bandit past.”

As midnight approached, the trio soared over palace walls via flight techniques, alighting silently on the Hall of Golden Chimes’ roof. After observing patrol patterns, they slipped inside during a guard rotation.

**Chapter 4981: Strike It Rich**

Qiqi gaped at the opulent hall. “So much gold! We’re rich!”

Their moment shattered as guards shouted, “Intruders!” Guan Yu incapacitated two near the throne while Qiqi scattered sleep-inducing powder. Hiding behind the imperial seat, they studied the gem now glowing faintly.

“There! The symbols match the Eight-Sided Drum Technique!” Guan Yu whispered excitedly as golden patterns morphed within the stone—sometimes characters, sometimes cryptic sigils.

“It’s beautiful,” Qiqi murmured, mesmerized by the shifting hues.

“Stay down!” Guan Yu hissed as footsteps approached. Palace guards’ habit of stationing indoors had surprised him. Praying their earlier scuffle went unnoticed, they waited, the gem’s secrets tantalizingly close.

**Chapter 4982: Incomprehension**

Crouched in shadow, Guan Yu’s mind raced. The gem’s liquid-like inscriptions confirmed its ties to the martial art he sought. But with patrols passing outside, extraction seemed impossible. “If we’re discovered now...”

Wang Xiaorong gripped his arm. “We retreat if needed. This isn’t worth capture.”

Qiqi, however, stared transfixed. “The symbols... they’re alive. Why hasn’t anyone else noticed?”

“Arrogance blinds the powerful,” Guan Yu muttered. “They see a decorative stone, not a key to transcendence.”

As voices faded outside, he edged toward the gem. Its glow pulsed, as if sensing his intent. One touch might unveil everything—or trigger alarms. Heart pounding, he reached out...
