“Where are we going?” Guan Yu casually lowered his head to ask.

“I’ll take you to meet Gao Wei, okay…” Du Xiaojuan tilted her petite face upward, her voice brimming with excitement.

“Who?” Guan Yu froze, staring at Du Xiaojuan in astonishment. Surely this wasn’t a case of shared names? Gao Wei—the dazzling superstar adored by millions, the celestial queen of entertainment! Though Guan Yu wasn’t a star-chaser or a fan of this glamorous beauty, he knew perfectly well that when it came to the hottest triple-threat star in the country—acting, singing, dominating screens—this scarlet-tier diva was none other than Gao Wei!

Despite debuting just over a year ago, she had skyrocketed to fame overnight. Her advertisements and portraits blanketed cities from the Great Wall to the Yangtze River. Her saccharine vocals and ethereal image permeated every corner—even vegetable vendors and ringtones echoed her songs…

**Chapter 87: Such a Pretty Little Darling**

Could this *really* be *the* superstar Gao Wei? Guan Yu gaped at Du Xiaojuan, mind whirling.

“Hehe… Stunned speechless? Yep, it’s Sister Weiwei.” Du Xiaojuan giggled, playfully twisting Guan Yu’s fingers as she explained.

“That… mega-celebrity?” Guan Yu felt this surreal. Stars existed in realms of applause and roses—how could ordinary folks ever brush shoulders with them?

Yet… Guan Yu remained unfazed. To him, celebrities were just people—sure, she sang well and looked gorgeous, but so what?

“Indeed! She’s actually my senior alumna! Attended our school before fame made her drop out…” Du Xiaojuan shrugged nonchalantly.

“You’re not one of Sister Weiwei’s fans, are you?”

“No…” Guan Yu replied flatly. Celebrities left him cold.

“Are you close with Gao Wei?”

“Of course! We’re best friends. Sister Weiwei’s super down-to-earth. Sometimes she sneaks out in disguise to hang with me—so fun when no one recognizes her!” Du Xiaojuan chirped, eyes sparkling.

“Hmm…” Guan Yu nodded, suddenly straightening to study Du Xiaojuan intently.

“Answer me truthfully… Do stars’ private lives get messy? All that co-starring and filming—do they just… hook up randomly?” He smirked, adopting a gossipy tone.

Du Xiaojuan blinked, processing his words for two full seconds before retorting, “Nonsense! Sister Weiwei isn’t like that! She’s pure as jade! Barely does hand-holding scenes, let alone kisses! That’s why they call her the ‘Jade Maiden Diva’!” Her cheeks puffed indignantly.

“Uh-huh… I know public images are carefully crafted. But behind the scenes? Aren’t all celebrities two-faced? Acting saintly in public while being regular—or worse—people privately?” Guan Yu shrugged. After all, stars prioritized reputation over substance—their morals and intellect might lag behind middle-schoolers!

Recent scandals kept proving it: perfectly maintained façades shattered by leaked photos, leaving the public agape.

“Sister Weiwei’s different! Stop slandering her!” Du Xiaojuan glared, sulkily muttering.

Grinning, Guan Yu dropped the subject.

“Are we going or not? She’s free this afternoon between performances here. We can visit her rehearsal!” Du Xiaojuan pleaded, puppy-dog eyes locked on him.

Though unenthused about star-gazing, Guan Yu relented under her hopeful gaze.

Near noon, they descended together, grabbing street food before waiting at a bus stop. Boarding the sparsely populated Route 9, they took seats near the rear door. Du Xiaojuan explained Gao Wei was prepping for a gala, squeezing in a brief N City stopover to meet her.

Clearly, this naive girl shared a genuine bond with the superstar—true confidantes.

Alighting at the Civic Center, Du Xiaojuan dialed Gao Wei while Guan Yu lit a cheap cigarette. A man approached—presumably Gao Wei’s aide avoiding public attention.

“Miss Du? Sister Weiwei awaits inside.” His gaze flicked to Guan Yu’s frayed jeans and worn shirt, nose wrinkling at the smoke.

After hastily finishing his cigarette (earning another disdainful glance), Guan Yu followed.

Backstage bustle greeted them. Then—a vision in white: Gao Wei stood radiant in a cream dress and silver sunglasses, fairy-like amidst the chaos.

Guan Yu’s breath caught. Damn! Even prettier than her photos—porcelain skin blushing faintly, features exquisitely carved.

**Chapter 88: Men’s Playthings**

No denying it—Gao Wei’s meteoric rise owed much to this heart-stopping beauty. Even nearby men gaped openly.

As the women chatted, Guan Yu wandered off to the smoking lounge. Inside, he overheard Gao Wei’s aide sneering:

“Celebrities? Just glorified whores! That icy act? Once legs spread, same as any woman...”

Guan Yu’s lip curled. Rejoining the group, he maintained calm decorum despite rising disgust.

When evening plans emerged, Gao Wei’s aide interrupted with a dinner invitation from a sponsor. Gao Wei refused, prioritizing her friends.

**Chapter 89: Dining with a Diva**

“Cancel it. I dislike schmoozing.” Her tone brooked no argument.

Delighted, Du Xiaojuan suggested night markets. The aide shot them a venomous glare as he left—prompting Guan Yu to activate his detection skill.

The man’s vile thoughts flooded in: *Who does she think she is? Just another bitch waiting to be mounted.*

“Hey,” Guan Yu called sharply. “Question—”
