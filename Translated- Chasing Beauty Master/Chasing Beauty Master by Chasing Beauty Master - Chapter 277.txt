“Hmm, it seems Guan Yu has done the latter before. Who was it again?”



Regardless of who it was, Guan Yu was similarly interrupted and equally enraged.



At this moment, Guan Zhongfu removed his oxygen mask, taking on a risk. Though minimal, any risk couldn’t be recklessly ignored.



If he hadn’t placed his hand over Guan Zhongfu’s heart before Lin Dong removed the oxygen mask, continuously channeling energy through the healing system to maintain the heart’s normal rhythm, even the slightest interruption could have suffocated Guan Zhongfu.



Now, with the arrow nocked and the bow drawn, Guan Yu had no time to heed the shouts at the door. He didn’t even lift his head, wholly focused on treating Guan Zhongfu.



Of course, he knew who had entered without looking. The only one so “responsible” for the patient—or rather, fearful of liability—and arriving at this moment had to be a doctor.



“Stop!” the doctor shouted. “Do you realize what you’re doing? You’re hastening the patient’s death! Reckless, utterly reckless! Why are you all standing there? Put the oxygen mask back on! And someone call the police—report this situation!”



Guan Yu inwardly sneered. *Typical—afraid of responsibility, even thinking to call the police. If anything happens to Father, they’ll wash their hands of it.*



“Leave the bandage removal to me. Clear out the noise-makers and ensure no one disturbs me,” Guan Yu said without looking up, instructing Lin Dong.



Lin Dong pursed his lips. He’d hoped to witness Guan Yu’s miraculous healing firsthand, but now resigned himself to manual labor.



“You heard him. He doesn’t want disturbances. Out of respect for your profession, I suggest you leave quietly,” Lin Dong said, turning to the intern approaching to reattach the oxygen mask.



Liu Dewei, an intern with inflated pride, roughly shoved Lin Dong. “Stupid dog—”



Before he finished, he was hurled against the wall, the impact knocking him unconscious.



The commotion drew a crowd outside, murmuring over the unconscious Liu.



The doctor, livid at being barred from his own patient’s room, turned to Guan Tian. “Are you the family? Do you realize this is murder? The patient’s condition is critical!”



Guan Tian glanced at Guan Yu, whose brow glistened with sweat. His heart clenched with anxiety.



“My brother is treating our father. He knows what he’s doing,” Guan Tian said coldly.



The doctor scoffed. “Quackery! You call this medicine? It’s murder!”



Guan Yu ignored him, focused on his hands over Guan Zhongfu’s heart and forehead.



Suddenly, Guan Yu’s hands trembled, sweat dripping. Guan Zhongfu’s face flushed unnaturally.



“Enough!” Lin Dong snapped, seizing the doctor and tossing him out.



Moments later, Guan Yu exhaled sharply, lifting his hands. “Done.”



Guan Tian rushed to Guan Zhongfu’s side as the old man’s eyelids fluttered open.



“Dad’s awake,” Guan Yu announced.



The doctor, gaping from the doorway, muttered in awe, “This guy... he’s like Hua Tuo reborn!”



**Chapter 702: Dude, Are You the Reincarnation of Hua Tuo?**



**Chapter 703: The Overbearing Lackey**



“Dad, how do you feel?” Guan Tian asked urgently.



“It... hurts,” Guan Zhongfu rasped.



“Healing takes time,” Guan Yu said. “I’ll prescribe herbs. Four months, and he’ll recover fully.”



The doctor, humbled, approached. “Your technique—was that Qi-based healing from Traditional Chinese Medicine?”



Guan Yu nodded. “Something like that.”



The doctor’s eyes lit with fervor. “Incredible! Might we... discuss it?”



Guan Yu smirked. “Perhaps.”
