“He said mysteriously, ‘Have you heard of the Gu in Yun Dian?’”

“Gu? You’re saying you can use Gu?” Lin Dong widened his eyes.

Guan Yu deliberately coughed twice. “I only know a little about insect Gu. The rest I’m clueless about.”

“Really?” Lin Dong sounded skeptical.

“At this point, would I lie to you?” Guan Yu feigned displeasure.

“Who taught you?” Lin Dong pressed.

“A master. I can’t reveal his identity, and don’t think I’ll pass on his methods. He forbade sharing this knowledge.” Guan Yu cut off Lin Dong’s inquiries.

Lin Dong relented. “Show me how you control them.”

Guan Yu glanced pitifully at Wan Qianshan. “I’m not fully skilled. If the spider bites your liver or spleen, you’ll have to endure it.”

Now, Wan Qianshan understood Guan Yu’s earlier threat about making him regret being born. He was being used as a lab rat.

Under Lin Dong’s watchful eye, Guan Yu placed a spider near Wan Qianshan’s mouth. Despite Wan Qianshan’s struggles, Lin Dong dislocated his jaw, forcing compliance.

“Watch closely,” Guan Yu instructed, forming a circle with his fingers and blowing a melody. The spider crawled into Wan Qianshan’s mouth.

After the spider vanished inside, Guan Yu stopped. “See that?”

Ignoring Wan Qianshan’s gagging, Guan Yu turned to Lin Dong. “Teach me this!”

“My master forbids it,” Guan Yu insisted, relieved at maintaining the charade.

Wan Qianshan finally broke under the threat of daily torture. Guan宇 secured his cooperation, threatening lethal consequences for disobedience.

“Let’s talk,” Guan Yu smiled.

Wan Qianshan, writhing in pain, succumbed. Guan宇 reveled in his newfound control over Taiwan’s underworld.

Later, as they smoked, Lin Dong revealed his past as a mercenary turned killer, seeking redemption. “I’ll be your right-hand man,” he declared.

Guan宇, stunned yet elated, welcomed the unexpected ally. Together, they plotted a new empire, Taiwan now under their grasp.

**Chapter 666: A Windfall from Heaven**

Wan Qianshan’s defeat marked Taiwan’s fall. Guan宇 and Lin Dong, now allies, reveled in their triumph. As night deepened, Lin Dong shared his past—a mercenary haunted by principles and lost comrades. His decision to join Guan宇 stemmed from厌倦 (weariness) of杀戮 (killing), seeking purpose beyond bloodshed.

“Why me?” Guan宇 asked.

“You’ve got grit,” Lin Dong replied, lighting another unsmoked cigarette—a ritual honoring fallen战友 (comrades). The night echoed with stories of佣兵 (mercenaries),原则 (principles), and redemption.

Thus, the duo forged an unbreakable bond,台湾’s underworld at their feet.
