“Crystal Toad!”

The moment these two words left Guan Yu’s lips, everyone present—including the elf clan chief—wore expressions of shock.

“It seems they truly know of this matter. This simplifies things. Now, I’m eighty percent certain the pact between the elves and the Dragon Clan is tied to the Crystal Toad!”

With this revelation, Guan Yu felt a surge of confidence in steering the situation.

“How much do you know about the Crystal Toad?”

At the mention of the Crystal Toad, the old man’s eyes gleamed as he pressed eagerly for answers.

Hearing this, Guan Yu nearly cursed aloud, thinking, *How much do I know? Damn it, I only know the name itself! What it does, what it looks like, where it is—I’ve no clue!*

Of course, he wouldn’t admit this. Instead, he smirked mysteriously. “Heh, such classified information isn’t something I’d casually disclose.”

The young man who had earlier clashed with Guan Yu rose again, sneering, “Hmph! I say he’s just spouting rumors! All this talk of the Dragon Clan and Crystal Toad is a smokescreen. His real aim is to pursue Amy!”

“Ah… Amy?” Only then did Guan Yu realize this fellow was Amy’s suitor. *No wonder he’s been hostile. Quite the lovesick fool!*

“But…” Guan Yu frowned. While Amy was undeniably cute, among the elf clan’s many beauties, she wasn’t the most striking—Roxy, for instance, seemed more mature and elegant. *Why is he fixated on Amy? Does he have a thing for young girls?*

As Guan Yu’s thoughts wandered, Amy suddenly dashed into the hall. She marched up to the young man, hands on her hips, and snapped, “Locke! This is your final warning—stop insulting my friend! If I catch you doing it again, I’ll never speak to you for the rest of my life!”

Locke froze, hastily explaining, “Amy, you misunderstand! I’m acting for the safety of our clan! Our Life Source faces its greatest crisis. If we let outsiders infiltrate us now, it’ll mean ruin!”

Amy covered her pointed ears with her hands. “I don’t want to hear your excuses! Not listening!”

As Amy threw her tantrum, the elders stifled chuckles. Guan Yu, however, was baffled. Earlier, Kelly and Roxy had been stopped by guards halfway up the steps—proof of the elves’ strict hierarchy. *How is Amy allowed to act so recklessly in such a formal setting?*

“Could it be…?”

Before Guan Yu could voice his suspicion, Amy skipped over to the clan chief, tugging his sleeve and whining, “Daddy, look! Locke’s bullying me again…”

*Just as I thought! No wonder she dares act so boldly, and why Locke is so obsessed. So she’s the clan chief’s daughter—the elf princess? Hmm, why does my heart itch again…?*

As Guan Yu mentally sketched his harem ambitions, Amy twirled before him in a flutter of pink silk. “Brother Dragon, do I look pretty today?”

Guan Yu glanced over. Her formal gown hugged her petite frame, accentuating her curves, while a butterfly hairpin completed her princess-like charm.

When he remained silent, Amy pouted, shaking his arm. “Brother Dragon, say something! If I’m not pretty, I’ll change into another dress…”

To others, her antics might seem merely improper, but to Locke, each touch was a dagger to his heart.

He stood abruptly, addressing the chief. “Esteemed Chief, how can we permit this farce in our sacred council hall? Especially from this… suspicious outsider!”

Elder Kyle stroked his beard, nodding. “Indeed. With our clan in turmoil, any mishap could spell disaster. Our enemies still covet the Life Source.”

Locke and Kyle exchanged knowing smirks.

“He’s not an outsider!” Amy protested. “He’s my friend! He saved my life! *You’re* the bad ones!”

“Saved you?” Locke scoffed. “More likely staged it! He’s probably colluding with the Blackwater Mercenaries!”

Guan Yu’s patience snapped. He turned slowly, icy rage in his voice. “Utter one more slander, and I’ll smash your mouth.”

The threat hung lethally in the air. Truthfully, Guan Yu wasn’t confident in a fight—his gravity-based skills, honed in another world, still needed adaptation here.

Locke seethed. Pride prevented him from crude threats, yet Guan Yu’s insult demanded retaliation. Only the chief’s presence held him back.

Tension crackled until the chief intervened. “Enough! Locke, withdraw. Elders, leave us. I must speak with Sir Guan Yu privately.”

Reluctantly, the council filed out. Locke lingered, hissing at Guan Yu, “Don’t get cocky. Remember whose territory this is.”

As others departed, Amy stuck out her tongue playfully at Guan Yu.

**Chapter 1244: The Murong Family**

Alone with the chief, Guan Yu sighed. “Seems your people aren’t fond of me.”

The chief smiled. “The issue lies with you, Sir Guan. You claimed Dragon Clan heritage earlier, yet now admit otherwise.”

Surprisingly, the chief showed no anger. “Your true purpose here?”

Guan Yu, respecting the chief’s wisdom, replied, “I’m not from Blue Beauty Continent. The first person I met here was an elf—hence my visit.”

Though puzzled, the chief nodded. “I trust you, for Amy does. Harm none here, and you’ll remain our friend.”

Relieved, Guan Yu detailed the Crystal Toad intel.

The chief mused, “A youth and a middle-aged man seeking the Crystal Toad… Could they be from Jinzhou City’s Murong Family?”

“The Murong Family?”

“They’ve grown arrogant since marrying into the royal Qin family. Their young master, though sickly, is a prodigy—already an Advanced Sword Master at his age.”

Guan Yu snorted. “Royal in-laws, huh? No wonder he acted so high-handed.”

“In Blue Beauty,” the chief explained, “humans dominate, divided into the Qin royal family, Dark Mercenary Alliance, and Light Mercenary Alliance. The Murongs cling to Qin’s coattails.”

**Chapter 1245: The Island of Life**

“What’s your cultivation level?” Guan Yu dared ask.

The chief—Allen—laughed. “Elves master magic. I’m a Forbidden Curse Mage, equivalent to a human Sword Emperor.”

*Sword Emperor!* Guan Yu’s pulse quickened. *In my world, that’s near the Fusion stage. A true powerhouse.*

“To be recognized as a master here,” Allen added, “one must reach at least Sword King rank.”

“And in Jinzhou City?”

“You’re already qualified.”

Pride and unease warred in Guan Yu—exposed yet holding a trump card: his hidden artifact, “Vajra.”

A yelp interrupted them. Amy rubbed her head, peeking from the rafters. “Daddy, you hurt me!”

Allen sighed. “Eavesdropping again?”

“I… wanted to protect Brother Dragon from you!”

“Wouldn’t you worry about *me*?”

“Of course not!”

Allen’s face fell. *My own daughter, forsaking me for this outsider…*

“Ah, child! Have you forgotten how I doted on you? Where’s your concern for your old father?”
