After everyone dispersed, Guan Yu exited the grand hall when Chief Zheng hurried after him, panting heavily. “Guan Yu, please wait! There’s something I must clarify with you.”

“Oh? Chief Zheng, speak freely,” Guan Yu replied courteously. Chief Zheng was Xiao Zhi’s father. Though Guan Yu hadn’t interacted much with him, he knew the man to be honorable.

To such a man, courtesy was due. Chief Zheng wore an apologetic expression. “Guan Yu, I must explain something. Xiao Zhi knows you’re undertaking this mission and understands the dangers of the desert. He’s been insisting on joining you, but I refused. Selfishly speaking, I know the perils awaiting there. As his father, I can’t risk my only son’s life. I don’t want him trapped in such danger.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Chief Zheng, I fully understand. Even if I were in your position, I’d make the same choice. That’s precisely why I didn’t select Xiao Zhi when Master allowed me to choose companions. You’ve no need for apologies.”

Chief Zheng hadn’t expected such reasonableness. “You’re most gracious! But Xiao Zhi is stubbornly loyal. He keeps badgering me daily, swearing he’ll go with you. I’ve resorted to confining him temporarily. If you could understand this…”

“Uncle Zheng, there’s no need for explanations. I completely comprehend your position. Let’s leave it at that.”

“Thank you for your understanding. If you require anything for this mission, don’t hesitate to ask.” With that, Chief Zheng departed.

Guan Yu sympathized deeply. What father wouldn’t shield his child from mortal danger? The desert’s hazards were no place for a beloved son.

Soon, Chief Dai approached with a sigh. “Guan Yu, wouldn’t you prefer Siqi’s company over Yan Zhao’s? She’d be far more useful.”

Guan Yu shook his head vehemently. “Chief Dai, I beg you—do not permit Siqi to join! I absolutely cannot allow it.”

“Why? Do you fear her holding you back?” Chief Dai glared.

“Of course not!” Guan Yu explained. “Siqi’s cultivation is formidable. My concern is her safety. In that treacherous environment, I might fail to protect her when danger strikes. Just as with Xiao Zhi, I cannot risk her life.”

Chief Dai nodded. “I understand your chivalrous intentions. But this matter escapes my control. Siqi followed me here despite my dissuasion. She insists on accompanying you, fearing you’ll face the desert’s perils alone. Though I cherish her as my own daughter, she’s determined. Perhaps you can convince her to stay.”

“Rest assured, Chief Dai. I’ll persuade her.” Though Guan Yu gave his word, he sighed inwardly. Even without Chief Dai’s plea, he’d never allow Siqi’s participation—especially with Wang Xiaorong secretly joining the mission. The Demon Soul Sect’s Young Mistress’ notorious temper couldn’t abide rivals.

Moreover, Yan Zhao’s true allegiance remained unclear. If he proved loyal to the orthodox sects, Wang Xiaorong’s disguised presence risked exposure. Guan Yu resolved to separate from Yan Zhao in the desert at the earliest pretext.

After Chief Dai left, Guan Yu pondered countermeasures in his quarters. The mission’s dangers paled before the political intricacies. Should evidence emerge of his collaboration with the Demon Soul Sect’s heiress, even Yunqing Sect’s tolerance would evaporate.

His musings were interrupted by boisterous arrivals. Xiao Zhi stormed in, followed by A’Ze. “Guan Yu! You dare call me deadweight? Explain yourself!”

Guan Yu rose calmly. “I refused you both to spare you from peril. The desert mission risks nine deaths for one survival. Why court disaster?”

“Precisely because it’s lethal!” Xiao Zhi roared. “You think I’ll let you charge blindly to your doom? We’ve braved death together before!”

A’Ze added, “We’re sworn brothers! Since when do we fear shared dangers?”

Guan Yu wavered. Their loyalty moved him, but greater dangers loomed—Wang Xiaorong’s involvement must remain hidden. “The wasteland’s hazards differ entirely from past trials. I cannot guarantee...”

His protestations were cut short as Wang Jun (Monarch King) sauntered in unannounced. “Still playing the martyr, I see. Heard about your suicide mission. Came to bid farewell before you become desert bones.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Your concern touches me. But my fate’s not so easily sealed.”

Wang Jun’s smirk faded. “The Young Mistress foretold this mission. She demands you visit Demon Soul Sect beforehand. The Sect Master insists on meeting you.”

“Impossible. With Yan Zhao accompanying me, detouring to your sect’s territory invites suspicion.”

“A complication indeed,” Wang Jun conceded. “I’ll inform her. Expect my message by dawn.”

Left alone, Guan Yu contemplated the Sect Master’s motives. Was it a trap? His treasured artifacts made him a target. Until meeting Wang Xiaorong, he’d avoid that viper’s nest.

As midnight approached, Wang Jun slipped through Yunqing’s defenses via hidden paths. In a nearby town, he found Wang Xiaorong awaiting news.

“The plan proceeds,” he reported. “But Yan Zhao’s inclusion complicates matters. Guan Yu cannot divert to our stronghold.”

The Young Mistress’ eyes narrowed. “Then we adapt. Have Guan Yu await my signal. The desert rendezvous must proceed flawlessly.”

Back on Yunqing Mountain, Guan Yu finalized preparations. Yan Zhao’s watchful presence constrained every move. Yet greater than these earthly dangers were the storm clouds gathering—where demonic plots and orthodox suspicions collided, his path wound through knives.
