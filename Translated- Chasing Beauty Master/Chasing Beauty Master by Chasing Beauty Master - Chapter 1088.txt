“Yao Yu is immensely wealthy and also strikingly beautiful. Though she’s somewhat older, Lawyer Liu doesn’t mind—after all, he never pursued her for her looks. His true aim has always been to get his hands on her fortune. That’s the real prize here.

With money in his grasp, would he ever lack for young, gorgeous women? Lately, Lawyer Liu has been concocting excuses to get closer to Yao Yu. Coincidentally, Guan Yu’s recent troubles arose, prompting Yao Yu to seek Lawyer Liu’s help.

Lawyer Liu saw this as a golden opportunity falling from the heavens. Claiming to act “out of respect for Yao Yu,” he offered his services to Guan Yu free of charge. Even more fortuitously, he found himself collaborating with Yao Yu to seize the shares Guan Yu had acquired. This only strengthened Lawyer Liu’s confidence in eventually conquering Yao Yu.

Of course, no outsider could guess Lawyer Liu’s scheming. Guan Yu urgently needed to sell the Fang family shares, and Yao Yu felt deeply grateful that Lawyer Liu had connected her to this deal. After all, such sums were no trifle—everyone wanted a piece of profitable business.

**Chapter 2782: Carrying a Tortoise Shell**

Knowing Yao Yu intended to fleece him today, Guan Yu adopted a pitiful tone: “Ah, Aunt Yao, you don’t understand! I run a gang with many brothers to support. The more members we have, the more trouble they stir up daily. The money I spend just settling their disputes is enormous. I may look well-off, but life’s actually quite hard.”

“Poor? You call yourself poor while keeping a harem of women at home—each a peerless beauty from respectable families? Stop pretending! The chairman of Huayu Group whimpering about poverty to a woman? If this got out, all of China would laugh at you!” Yao Yu retorted mercilessly.

Lawyer Liu, unaware of Guan Yu’s identity, nearly jumped in shock at this revelation. Yao Yu smirked, seizing the chance to unveil her son-in-law’s status—no shame in that.

“Lawyer Liu, you probably didn’t know,” Yao Yu declared, “This Guan Yu is none other than the chairman of Huayu Group—the conglomerate that shakes the foundations of China!”

Lawyer Liu’s jaw dropped as he gaped at Guan Yu in disbelief. Stammering, he said, “Good heavens! I’ve failed to recognize Mount Tai! So you’re Chairman Guan of Huayu Group! What an honor!”

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “It’s nothing special—just empty titles.”

Had Lawyer Liu been ignorant of Guan Yu’s status, he might have deemed this arrogance. Now, however, it seemed perfectly fitting.

Internally, Lawyer Liu grew more determined to win Yao Yu by any means necessary. Beyond her wealth, securing her as a mother-in-law would provide an invaluable political ally. With her, he’d gain both influence and riches—a perfect scenario.

Upon learning Guan Yu’s identity, Lawyer Liu transformed into a different person—exuding exaggerated courtesy, his words now honeyed melodies.

Guan Yu disliked publicizing his Huayu Group chairmanship. The title felt like an ill-fitting shell—a burden forced upon him by Xu Jinglei and others. When forgotten, he felt free; when mentioned, the tortoise shell clamped down anew.

Like now: what should’ve been a straightforward business partnership devolved into groveling sycophancy. Guan Yu detested such dynamics—he neither wanted superiority nor unearned accolades.

He aspired to be ordinary—albeit comfortably wealthy. With his gang brothers, he never played the lofty boss, preferring camaraderie. He resolved to warn Yao Yu against casually revealing his title. Otherwise, she’d boast about her “Huayu Group chairman son-in-law” everywhere, inflating her prestige while suffocating him with unwanted attention.

“Enough modesty,” Yao Yu snapped. “Just don’t whine about poverty today. Can’t you let me gain some advantage for once?”

Guan Yu had planned to seek concessions himself, but she’d beaten him to it. As the junior party, he played the humility card: “Aunt Yao, you’re the elder. Wouldn’t exploiting a junior tarnish the Four Great Families’ reputation?”

Yao Yu faltered, surprised by his swift counter. The boy was shrewd, but she held her ground.

“Xiao Yu,” she cooed, adopting a maternal tone, “Let’s speak frankly. My offer is more than fair. Could you fetch better elsewhere? Selling to others lets them profit—why not me? Handling this yourself would be tedious, with no guarantee of swift payment.”

Yao Yu deployed every mercenary argument honed through decades of deals. Against a greenhorn like Guan Yu, she felt confident—especially sensing he still had room to concede.

“Aunt Yao, you’re still shortchanging me,” Guan Yu protested. “As the junior, shouldn’t I receive some favor? With your vast assets, must you squeeze millions from me?”

“Why not? Millions matter to anyone! You know how costly maintaining my enterprises is.”

As Guan Yu awaited her breaking point, he turned to Lawyer Liu: “What’s your cut in this deal?”

Caught off-guard, Lawyer Liu exchanged glances with Yao Yu before stammering, “W-well, Ms. Yao and I are jointly acquiring your shares. My limited capital only allows...modest participation. Heh.”

His fawning demeanor—reminiscent of a starstruck groupie—repulsed Guan Yu.

Spotting Lü Mei descending the stairs humming, Guan Yu seized his moment: “Aunt Yao, these Fang shares aren’t mere stock. Acquiring them makes you majority shareholder—and future chairman. The profits would dwarf today’s price, no?”

**Chapter 2783: Making Headlines**

Yao Yu stiffened. She’d discussed this very angle with Lawyer Liu, hoping Guan Yu’s ignorance would let them buy low.

“I...hadn’t considered that,” she lied. “I’d likely resell quickly—too busy for management. My offer’s generous. Take it or leave it.”

Her tone turned steely, projecting finality.

Lü Mei plopped beside Xue Jing, grabbing the remote. Guan Yu raised his voice deliberately: “Aunt Yao, I expected leniency, but you slash nearly ten million? Isn’t that excessive?”

Hearing this, Lü Mei spun around: “Mom! Why cheat Guan Yu?”

Yao Yu paled—last time Lü Mei intervened, she’d forced a money-losing deal. Quick-thinking, she gestured at Lawyer Liu: “This is Lawyer Liu’s business proposal. His lowball offer’s being negotiated. Don’t meddle—go play.”

Guan Yu marveled at her deflection. Exposing the truth now would paint him as manipulative.

As he strategized, the TV blared breaking news: “A luxury car was caught ‘rocking’ mid-traffic today—reckless behavior filmed by multiple witnesses...”

The shaky footage showed a sedan wobbling violently down the road. A female voice exclaimed, “Look at that car! Shameless—doing it in broad daylight!”

The vehicle then swerved erratically before stopping sideways. The reporter continued: “We’ve received eyewitness footage of this outrageous incident...”

“That car looks familiar,” Lawyer Liu mused.

Guan Yu froze—it was his car! Xue Jing and Lü Mei watched avidly, oblivious to the humiliation. When the camera zoomed on his license plate, Lü Mei shrieked and shut the TV.

“Mom! We were just roughhousing inside!” Lü Mei lied, face crimson.

Yao Yu’s expression screamed disbelief. Lawyer Liu blurted, “That was your car, Mr. Guan? So you three were—” He choked back the rest, offering an apologetic grin.

Guan Yu seethed at the lawyer’s tactlessness. The damage was done—their “car antics” now national gossip.

**Chapter 2784: Smooth Transaction**

Yao Yu chided, “Road horseplay is dangerous! Don’t repeat this!” Her tone suggested she believed the scandalous version.

As Lü Mei fled upstairs with Xue Jing, Guan Yu desperately shifted focus: “Lawyer Liu, let’s finalize the paperwork.”

Eager to please, Lawyer Liu produced the share transfer contract. Signing would conclude this nightmare.

Though the Fang shares could fetch nearly 40 million competitively, Yao Yu’s 30 million offer—with Lawyer Liu skimming 6 million—was pushed through. Guan Yu had hoped to leverage Lü Mei for better terms, but the viral scandal crushed those plans.

Mortified at being “exposed” before his mother-in-law, Guan Yu signed hastily. The deal closed smoothly—Yao Yu netting over 10 million profit, Lawyer Liu securing his cut.

As Guan Yu escaped the awkward scene, he vowed never to let Lü Mei’s antics jeopardize negotiations again. Some battles, it seemed, couldn’t be won—especially when televised nationwide.
