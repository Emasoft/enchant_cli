“Do we have any obligation to do that?” Ling Su said disdainfully. “You caused this mess yourself. Clean it up on your own. We couldn't care less about your affairs. As long as you retrieve the silver, we don't give a damn about your methods.

“If you can't recover the silver, our entire plan collapses. Without funds, every step would be a struggle. We'll have no choice but to return to Yunqing Sect. When that happens, who knows how Master will punish you.”

Guan Yu knew Ling Su was deliberately intimidating Lin Chen. He'd never mentioned returning to Yunqing Sect. Observing Lin Chen's current immobilized state – his poisoned leg requiring weeks of recuperation – he chose not to expose the bluff. Let's see how Lin Chen wriggles out of this.

Lin Chen grimaced. “Surely it's not that dire? I was swindled too! Besides, we're heading into the desert soon. What use is silver there? We can proceed regardless!”

“Pretty words!” Ling Su snapped. “That silver was Master's travel funds for our mission! You lost everyone's resources. What now?”

“You're determined to see me dead!” Lin Chen moaned. “Must you torment me so? I'm the victim here! Don't you see how grievously I've suffered?” His plea met stony silence.

“Frankly, your death would be relief – one less burden. Suffering? You earned it!” Ling Su retorted. “Fooled by a pretty face! Not only did you lose the silver, you've crippled yourself. Stay here and rot – you're unfit for the mission.”

Guan Yu added coldly, “Your injury requires days of rest. We won't delay the entire group for your sake.”

“You'd abandon me? This is outrageous!” Lin Chen shouted, shocked by their ruthlessness.

Guan Yu's gaze remained impassive. “You know your repeated transgressions. I won't jeopardize our quest for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique because of you. Consider Master's wrath if we fail – and you still show no remorse.”

“What good is remorse now?” Lin Chen spat. “Stop lecturing me! Find that wench Amei and reclaim our silver!”

Ling Su jabbed a finger at him. “Fool's errand! Without evidence, she'll deny everything. We'd look like troublemakers.”

“This quilt from Amei's inn is proof!” Lin Chen weakly gestured at the bedding, knowing full well its inadequacy. The truth sank in – recovering the silver was near impossible without solid evidence.

Chapter 4460: Decision Made

Guan Yu sighed. “Your actions have already derailed us. Perhaps you're unfit for this team. Though captain, I'll put it to a vote.”

Ling Su brightened. “As captain, your word represents us all! Decide now!” Eagerness dripped from his voice – Lin Chen's expulsion would sweeten the journey.

Lin Chen lay silent. To be undone by a woman! Fury simmered beneath his pain. Once healed, he'd make that bitch pay. As for being left behind... he had no defense. His colossal blunder left no alternatives.

Making a final plea, Lin Chen rasped, “Guan Yu, I erred. But retrieving replacement funds from the sect takes two days – time I need to heal. Let me rejoin then!”

“Enough.” Guan Yu cut him off. “We won't wait. Your presence risks further incidents. The silver issue is mine to resolve.” Turning to leave, he added cruelly, “You'll receive no funds for lodging or food. Survive on your own.”

“You're signing my death warrant!” Lin Chen shrieked. “Master will hear of this!”

“Tell him whatever you like.” Guan Yu paused at the doorway. “If you dare face him.”

Alone, Lin Chen seethed. He'd expected leniency if he showed remorse, but Guan Yu's harshness surprised him. The decision stood – tomorrow's departure would leave him stranded.

As Guan Yu issued orders for the morning, Ling Su practically glowed. Finally rid of that millstone! Let the wretch perish here.

Wang Jun approached cautiously. “Should we confront the bun shop? Any chance of recovering the silver?”

“None.” Guan Yu shook his head. “They planned this thoroughly. Without evidence, we'd just cause a scene.”

Chapter 4461: Must Be Cautious

Lin Chen struggled upright, head throbbing. Desperation sparked an idea. Summoning a junior disciple from Zuokong Peak, he whispered, “What I tell you now stays secret. Understood?”

The wide-eyed novice nodded eagerly. “I swear, Senior Brother!”

Leaning closer, Lin Chen revealed, “That whore took more than pocket silver. She stole a 500-tael note from me – part of the 1,000 taels Master entrusted. Recover it, and the note is yours.”

The disciple gasped. “Five hundred? But how...?”

“Gather trusted brothers.” Lin Chen's eyes gleamed. “Use any means necessary. Split the silver among yourselves. Just bring that bitch to me!”

As the novice hurried out, Lin Chen smiled grimly. Let the fools chase shadows. Their commotion might flush Amei out. Meanwhile, he focused spiritual energy on his poisoned leg, hastening recovery. Soon, he'd settle scores personally.

The disciple bumped into Ling Su, spilling the secret. “Five hundred more taels? That thrice-cursed fool!” Ling Su's roar echoed through the inn. “Fancied himself a lady's man? Look at that dumpling face!”

“Senior Brother Lin said we could keep the silver...” the novice stammered.

“Since when does that miser share crumbs?” Ling Su scoffed. Yet greed warred with suspicion. “Still... five hundred taels...”

Chapter 4462: Never Cared

“You believe that skinflint?” Ling Su glared at the trembling disciple. “He'd skin a flea for its hide! This reeks of desperation.”

“But Senior Brother Lin's helpless now! Why lie?”

Ling Su paused. The novice had a point. Stroking his chin, he muttered, “Even if true... confronting that woman's dangerous.”

“We're Yunqing disciples!” The novice puffed his chest. “A mere woman against us?”

Memories of Amei's cunning smile gave Ling Su pause. Yet silver's siren call proved stronger. “Gather three others. We'll investigate – discreetly.”

As they prepared, none noticed Guan Yu observing from the shadows. Let them play their games. His path remained clear – the desert awaited, with or without Lin Chen's drama.
