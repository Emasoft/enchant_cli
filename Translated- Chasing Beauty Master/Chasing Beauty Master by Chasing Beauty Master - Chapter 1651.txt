Head Zheng said with a smile, “Indeed, Guan Yu. This cultivation manual is truly peculiar – every page is filled with various drawn images without a single written character. I cannot comprehend their meanings nor discern what these illustrations represent.”

Guan Yu remained silent as he opened the manual. True to their words, each page bore several strange, abstract-like diagrams devoid of any text.

“This is truly bizarre. How does one even study such a thing?” Guan Yu remarked gloomily. “I suspect this technique doesn’t originate from our world.”

“Oh? What makes you say that?”

Guan Yu explained, “Observe these images – they bear no resemblance to anything from our realm. Only the later depictions of massive beasts are recognizable. The earlier geometric patterns... who could possibly decipher their meaning? I believe this Spirit Beast Technique wasn’t created by humans, but rather by beings from another realm – perhaps the demon world.”

While Xiao Zhi had limited understanding of the demon world, Head Zheng’s advanced age and vast experience granted him broader perspective. The elder nodded, “Your reasoning holds merit. To my knowledge, humans lack the innate ability to subjugate spirit beasts. Such arts were transmitted from other realms.”

“But Father,” Xiao Zhi interjected anxiously, “the cultivation method I obtained from the Merit Cauldron specifically concerns spirit beast subjugation. How could you claim humans lack this capability?”

“I didn’t mean humans cannot learn it,” Head Zheng clarified. “These techniques weren’t invented by our kind, but that doesn’t preclude us from mastering them. Do you understand?”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “I see. Yet this puzzles me further – if these arts aren’t human in origin, why would our sect’s sacred Merit Cauldron bestow such a manual upon me?”

This question silenced Head Zheng. The Merit Cauldron’s blessings were well-documented – recipients gained enhanced spiritual energy and tailored cultivation paths. Xiao Zhi had received both the Spirit Beast Technique and Soul Mantra, indicating his destined path. Yet progress remained frustratingly slow.

Guan Yu interjected thoughtfully, “The Merit Cauldron, while miraculous, remains but a magical artifact – possibly not even of human creation. Head Zheng, do you know its origins?”

The elder shook his head. “Its existence predates memory within our sect. None question its provenance – it simply belongs.”

“These diagrams constitute their written language,” Guan Yu continued, flipping through the manual. “See here – a person channeling energy toward a tree. These lines suggest high-level practitioners could command plants as well as beasts.”

“That’s absurdly complex!” Xiao Zhi protested. “Interpreting images risks fatal errors in cultivation!”

“Two solutions exist,” Guan Yu countered. “Either advance your Soul Mantra cultivation to comprehend them naturally, or learn the creators’ pictorial language. Until then, focus on foundational training.”

Head Zheng advised sternly, “Patience, Xiao Zhi. Rash interpretation courts disaster. Heed Guan Yu’s counsel.”

The youth sighed. “I understand. True growth comes from internal cultivation, not external shortcuts.”

Head Zheng smiled approvingly. “Your maturity pleases me, son. Much credit goes to Guan Yu’s influence.” Turning to the young man, he added, “We remain indebted for your help with the blood poison incident. Without your aid and Elder Lu’s fifty-year cultivation sacrifice...”

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “Fate’s hand guided us. By the way, why did Elder Lu send livestock to your peak recently?”

Xiao Zhi explained, “In our sect, only Front Return Peak raises poultry and livestock. Other peaks must purchase provisions from Elder Lu – at exorbitant prices. His sudden generosity surprised us.”

“He claimed it was to nourish Xiao Zhi’s recovery,” Head Zheng chuckled. “Though none dare offend him – his control over meat supplies makes him influential. Even the Sect Leader treads carefully.”

Guan Yu laughed. “So Elder Lu reigns through everyone’s stomachs! Why don’t other peaks cultivate their own provisions?”

“Terrain and expertise limit us,” Head Zheng sighed. “Front Return Peak possesses fertile land and farming knowledge from nearby villages. Our Suspended Summit’s cliffs permit no agriculture.”

As conversation turned to roasted meats, Guan Yu’s thoughts drifted to the waiting figure outside his chamber. Returning to Tiger Head Peak, he found Siqi lingering by his door.

“How long have you waited?” he asked the blushing beauty.

“Master sent me regarding the desert mission,” she murmured, entering as he closed the door. When he drew near, her breath quickened.

“Why shut the door?” she whispered.

Guan Yu’s lips brushed her ear. “What do you imagine?”

As she trembled in his embrace, half-hearted protests fading, he teased, “Perhaps the illustrious First Senior Sister considers herself above me?”

“Never!” she gasped. “I’ve always...” Her trailing words hung between them, charged with unspoken possibilities.
