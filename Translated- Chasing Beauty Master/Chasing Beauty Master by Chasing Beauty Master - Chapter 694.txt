“Could it be that on Earth, some opponents stronger than myself have returned from the Divine Miracles? But why can't I sense their presence at all now?”

“Master, no enemies appeared. You were the one who recklessly attacked that ice pillar and got injured by its backlash. By the way, Master, check on Senior Sister Xue Jing. She seems... unwell.” Jones chose not to reveal that Guan Yu himself had injured him earlier. From Guan Yu's current demeanor, it was clear he remained unaware of his own actions.

Guan Yu's last memory resurfaced – Xue Jing transforming into an ice sculpture within the crystalline pillar. He whirled toward the structure and saw her frozen form remained unchanged, standing motionless as deep-blue ice encased her entire body. Even her flowing hair had crystallized, no longer resembling human flesh.

Struggling to his feet, Guan Yu staggered toward the ice pillar with Jones trailing behind. When his trembling fingers brushed its surface, the previously indestructible structure crumbled like fragile glass, its sustaining power vanished. As the pillar disintegrated, the Illusory Heaven Pearl hovering nearby erupted with golden radiance, its earthly projections intensifying.

A rasping voice cut through the air like rusted blades scraping stone: “Tsk tsk. Still alive? What resilient flesh.” The grating tones carried the awkwardness of disused vocal cords or clashing metal.

Depleted of spiritual energy and mental strength, Guan Yu hadn't detected the presence before. Now his heart sank as he recognized the aura – a Saint Sovereign, and one at the peak of that realm!

In his prime, ten Saint Sovereigns wouldn't have concerned him. Yet now, weakened below even a first-class mutant's capability, this confrontation spelled disaster. Beneath the Illusory Heaven Pearl's glow, above Xue Jing's frozen platform, a sinister black mist coalesced – an unnatural stormcloud in clear skies.

“Demons?” Guan Yu frowned.

“Kekeke! To find knowledge of our Demon Clan on this backwater planet... you elevate my expectations.” The writhing shadow laughed through its metallic voice.

Demons differed fundamentally from demonic cultivators, much as Celestials stood apart from immortal practitioners. Though Guan Yu had earlier sensed the Arctic Miracle's stable barriers during his aerial survey, evidence of demonic infiltration now proved his assumptions wrong.

“Petty demons dare call Earth backward? If your realm were so superior, why invade ours?” Guan Yu retorted, buying time while his energy recovered. His earlier frenzy against the ice pillar must have been this demon's doing – their methods always proved insidiously unpredictable.

His greatest dread crystallized – if multiple demons breached Earth's defenses, humanity faced extinction.

Chapter 1764: Demon Fang

“Why invade? Excellent question.” The mist contorted arrogantly. “Your primitive world mistakes science for wisdom. We bring salvation from ignorance – to grant eternal life through demonic union!”

Guan Yu and Jones exchanged incredulous glances. Earth's scientific community would reel at being labeled ignorant by these interlopers.

“Was it you who bewitched my consciousness earlier?” Guan Yu pressed, noting the demon's apparent stalling tactics.

The shadow finally condensed into humanoid form, descending with jerky movements. “Keke! My Soul Bewitchment Art serves well, no? You insects dare name your paltry awareness 'divine consciousness'? Humans exist as livestock – flesh for demons, souls for celestials. You exist to be harvested.”

As icy winds heralded two new dark vortices, Guan Yu's fears confirmed – this infiltration went beyond three demons. The newcomers' aura dwarfed their predecessor's, reducing the first demon to trembling servitude.

“Demon Fang-sama!” the initial demon groveled.

The hierarchy became clear – the massive leading figure (Demon Fang) commanded a subordinate (Blood Demon) and slave (Illusion Demon). Their dynamic mirrored parasitic relationships in nature.

“Illusion Demon,” the subordinate rasped like scraping metal, “why haven't you completed Lord's command to enthrall these humans?”

The slave demon retorted defiantly: “Blood Demon, when have we Illusion Clan ever failed our War Demon lords? Unlike your bloodsucking idleness!”

Guan Yu parsed their dynamics – War Demons held highest status, with Illusion and Blood Clans as parasitic underlings. Though Blood Demons ranked slightly higher, their rivalry permitted open conflict.

“Enough!” Demon Fang's roar silenced them. “Through our Clan's united efforts, we breached this world. Our mission – study humans and harvest specimens. Squabble again, and I'll purify you with demonfire!”

At the threat, both underlings quivered – the now-humanoid Illusion Demon trembling visibly, the still-misty Blood Demon rippling comically.

Demon Fang shifted focus to Guan Yu, materializing as a 2-meter-tall warrior with angular features and imposing beard. Jones pinched himself repeatedly, unable to process this nightmare made real.

“Human, where is your fear?” Demon Fang's phantom boots hovered threateningly near Guan Yu's prone form.

Guan Yu assessed the dire situation – Demon Fang surpassed his current strength, Blood Demon approached Realm Lord tier, Xue Jing lay helpless, Jones injured. Worse, if captured, humanity would remain unaware of the demonic invasion.

Chapter 1765: Malicious Intent

Stalling became Guan Yu's only hope. Before he could speak, Illusion Demon interjected: “Lord Fang, don't underestimate this human! Under my bewitchment, he unleashed near-Realm Lord power!”

Demon Fang leaned close, studying Guan Yu. Demons lacked spiritual sense, relying on observable strength. Yet Guan Yu's calm defiance mirrored peer recognition, not prey's terror.

“Intriguing. How cultivate such power here?” Demon Fang demanded.

Seizing opportunity, Guan Yu countered: “If Earth's so barren, deduce the source yourself.”

The taunt struck home. Demons hated intellectual challenges, their reputation for brutality stemming from mental limitations. “Enough! Captive's fate needs no explanation.”

Guan Yu cursed inwardly – demons' literal-mindedness thwarted manipulation.

Above, Xue Jing's spirit observed helplessly. Though bodiless, she sensed growing power – not physical, but profound soul-deep confidence. The Arctic's primal energies through Illusory Heaven Pearl perhaps...

“Illusion Slave!” Demon Fang barked. “Explain that frozen human and the Primordial Source!”

“The woman accompanied this man seeking treasures,” Illusion Demon gestured at the golden orb. “The massive spiritual influx earlier flowed into her, causing this ice transformation.”

Demon Fang's eyes glowed. “That energy rivaled a Realm Lord's! Consuming her could elevate my rank!” To underlings: “Blood Demon takes her blood, Illusion Demon her soul. Our mission prospers!”

Xue Jing's spirit recoiled in horror. Guan Yu's fury erupted – Xue Jing followed him to this fate, he'd die before allowing demonic desecration.

Summoning remnant energy, Guan Yu manifested a glowing sword. “Touch her, and we perish together!”
