“These two still have no idea who Young Master Men is,” Yue Jing sneered disdainfully. “Relax, it’s nothing. A mere City Lord’s Manor isn’t worth the Red Lotus Sect’s notice. So what if I beat his son? He stole our Jade Eight Trigrams (Yù Bāguà).”

“If they dare refuse to release our people, I’ll storm in with you and slaughter this arrogant City Lord’s Manor to rescue our fellow disciples!”

Yue Jing’s bravado was truly unparalleled—a master of empty boasts. Lai Lixia gazed at her senior brother with admiration, convinced of his invincible authority. Suddenly, chaotic noises erupted from the manor as soldiers swarmed out, encircling them.

Moments later, Young Master Men was wheeled out on a chair by a servant, followed by Guan Yu and others.

“Guan Yu? Why are you here?” Yue Jing showed no surprise at Men’s appearance but frowned at Guan Yu’s presence.

Lai Lixia’s confidence wavered as she met Men’s venomous glare. During their last encounter, they’d crippled him while reclaiming the Jade Eight Trigrams, never imagining he was the City Lord’s son. Now they’d provoked a formidable enemy.

Guan Yu tilted his head arrogantly. “You’ve no right to ask. Must I report my whereabouts to you? Who do you think you are—dog shit or bull dung?”

“You—” Yue Jing’s retort died as Lai Lixia restrained him. Surrounded by dozens of soldiers, confrontation was unwise.

“Senior Brother, ignore him. We’re here to rescue our comrades. Save disputes for later,” she whispered.

Yue Jing nodded. Men, now wheeled forward, smirked. “Have you come to die?”

“The fault isn’t entirely ours,” Lai Lixia argued. “You stole our treasure. We never intended harm.”

Men’s face twisted. Mention of the Jade Eight Trigrams reignited his fury—his prized possession, brutally taken. “Are you speaking or farting? That’s pure horseshit!” he spat before regaining composure.

“Hand over the jade today, and I’ll spare you. Otherwise, you die tonight,” Men offered deceitfully.

Yue Jing scoffed. “By what power? Kill us, and the Red Lotus Sect will rain vengeance upon you!”

“Vengeance?” Guan Yu mocked. “Your sect’s a gaggle of mediocrities clinging to borrowed fame. Spare us the delusions.”

Lai Lixia interjected, “We seek the City Lord. Why imprison our brethren?”

“Must I spell it out?” Men snapped. “Look at this chair! You crippled me—that’s reason enough!”

“This is personal. We’ve heard Lord Men is righteous. Let our brothers go, and settle this between us.”

Men laughed coldly. “Who are you to demand an audience? Kneel and kowtow a hundred times—loudly—and I’ll consider it.”

“You go too far!” Yue Jing bristled.

“Too far? You stole my treasure! Shattered my legs!” Men roared.

Xiao Zhi stepped forward. “Enough talk. Arrest them. Only torture will satisfy Young Master’s wrath.”

“Seize them! Kill any who resist!” Men ordered.

Spears leveled, Lai Lixia pleaded, “Wait! We came to negotiate!”

“Negotiate? Return the jade, and live.”

Yue Jing tensed to fight, but Lai Lixia held him back. Surrender was their only path. “We erred, not knowing your status. Forgive us.”

Men waved dismissively. “I want no apologies. Take them!”

As soldiers closed in, the Red Lotus disciples fought valiantly but were overwhelmed. Xiao Zhi chanted, summoning storm clouds. Thunderbolts struck the pair, leaving them twitching on the ground.

“Bind them before they recover!” Xiao Zhi urged.

Dragged into the hall, Men demanded, “Search them! Find my jade!”

Soldiers rifled through their belongings. Lai Lixia writhed as a guard groped her. “Stop! I’ll kill you!”

“Enough!” Men barked when the jade was found. The lecherous soldier retreated reluctantly.

**Chapter 3486: Selfishness**

Men gloated over his reclaimed treasure. “Guan Yu, how should we handle them?”

“Imprison them for half a year. Let Men vent his wrath.”

“Too lenient! Execute them!” Men countered.

Guan Yu dissuaded, “Keep them alive. The Red Lotus may pay ransom. Kill them, and you lose leverage.”

Men relented. “Fine. But they’ll taste the Eight Great Torments first!”

As the captives were dragged away, Guan Yu mused. The Red Lotus would return for the jade, sparking bloodshed—a spectacle he’d happily watch.

Exiting, Xiao Zhi questioned, “Why bother with the wheelchair? We could’ve just informed Men.”

Guan Yu smiled. “The City Lord’s son is a useful ally. Even a local snake can’t be ignored. Notice how the Red Lotus hides but dares not strike?”

“True,” Az agreed. “Their inaction speaks volumes.”

“They’re selfish curs,” Guan Yu said. “Only personal gain moves them. Even ‘rescuers’ like these two act alone.”

Returning to Qin Manor, the group found turmoil. Qin Taijin, the eldest son, lay beaten and comatose. Servants clustered outside his chamber.

“Who’d dare attack him?” Xiao Zhi wondered.

Guan Yu shook his head. Even local royalty wasn’t safe. They postponed visiting the injured heir, retiring to Az’s chaotic room.

**Chapter 3487: Fortunate Survival**

Az’s squalid quarters appalled them—clothes and debris everywhere.

“You live like a beggar!” Guan Yu exclaimed.

Ignoring the mess, they strategized. But the day’s tensions lingered—a harbinger of greater storms.
