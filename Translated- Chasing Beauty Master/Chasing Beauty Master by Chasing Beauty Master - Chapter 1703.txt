Ling Su continued, “Earlier when I went out, I was wandering the streets and noticed something. Lin Chen met someone—that tall beauty from the daytime bun shop. To be honest, I intended to follow him and ruin his plans. But unexpectedly, I uncovered a far greater issue.”

Guanyu asked curiously, “What exactly happened?” So far, he couldn’t fathom what the problem might be. Could that beauty from the bun shop be a demon sect member discovered by Ling Su? If so, that would be perfect. This could seal Lin Chen’s death sentence, especially since Ling Su witnessed it. Even jumping into the Yellow River wouldn’t cleanse him of suspicion.

Ling Su hesitated to elaborate, but Guanyu pressed impatiently, “Earlier you said we can’t depart tomorrow because we’ve run out of silver. I thought Lin Chen had gambled it all away again, but he was out on a rendezvous? This matter could be trivial or grave. We should let Siqi see his true nature first.”

“Exactly. I think so too. We must inform Siqi so she understands what kind of person Lin Chen is and isn’t deceived by him,” Ling Su agreed. “However, while Lin Chen thought it a pleasant affair, he ended up being victimized.”

Guanyu widened his eyes, awaiting further explanation. This didn’t seem related to the demon sect. What did being “victimized” mean?

Ling Su continued, “Lin Chen went to an inn south of town to meet that beauty from the bun shop. There, she gave him wine laced with knockout drops. Afterward, every last coin on him was stolen—even the jade pendant he always carried is gone now.”

“Such a thing happened? What about the bun shop beauty?” Guanyu inquired, suspicious. He wondered if Ling Su had conspired with her to trap Lin Chen. The possibility seemed strong.

“By the time I barged into the room, the woman had vanished. Only Lin Chen remained, lying there like a dead dog,” Ling Su replied.

Guanyu eyed Ling Su doubtfully. Whether this was Lin Chen’s own doing or a setup with Ling Su’s involvement mattered little—either way, it benefited him.

“Brother Ling Su, how did you discover this? And in such detail—as if you witnessed it firsthand. Were you present?” Guanyu probed, testing his response.

“Truthfully, after spotting Lin Chen, I tailed him to the Amelie Inn in the southern district. He entered,” Ling Su admitted sheepishly. “I followed and saw him enter a room with that woman. Resentful, I planned to expose his affair. Even if no one believed me, interrupting their ‘moment’ would satisfy me. But when their conversation inside suddenly ceased, I grew puzzled. Why no sounds during such activities? By the time I forced my way in, the woman had fled, leaving Lin Chen drugged and unconscious.”

Guanyu nodded. “I see. That bun shop woman isn’t simple.” He recalled how Lin Chen had lingered at her counter earlier, prompting him to drag Siqi over as interference. Who knew they’d arranged a nighttime meeting? Now, with all the group’s silver stolen from Lin Chen, the situation worsened.

Though half-doubting Ling Su’s story—unsure whether he conspired with the woman or Lin Chen walked into the trap himself—Guanyu deemed the cause irrelevant. The crucial issue was their lost funds. Without silver, their desert journey faced complications.

“Where’s Lin Chen now? Should we retrieve him?” Guanyu feigned concern, though he cared little for Lin Chen’s fate.

“It’s too late. The inns are closed, and the southern district’s far in this cold. Go yourself if you wish—I won’t,” Ling Su retorted. “This mess is Lin Chen’s own making. Let him suffer the consequences of his womanizing.”

**Chapter 4455: Narrow Escape**

“I won’t go either. Without evidence, causing a scene at the inn now is pointless,” Guanyu said flatly, his worried expression masking indifference.

Ling Su privately wished the woman had killed Lin Chen after robbing him. Why leave a nuisance alive? Both men shared the unspoken hope that Lin Chen might perish—only Xuánmíng would mourn him.

“Plans change again. We’ll wait until tomorrow,” Guanyu decided. If Lin Chen returned, they’d organize a search for the silver. If not, he’d cover expenses temporarily, reimbursed later by Xuánmíng.

Events had spiraled beyond expectations. Lin Chen’s reckless behavior—seduced and drugged by a woman—was unsurprising given her allure. Clearly, she’d targeted his wealth.

By midnight, the streets lay deserted. Lin Chen awoke shivering violently, his lower body numb with cold. Disoriented, he found himself in a desolate graveyard outside Camel Town. Panicking, he stood—only to realize he was naked, his clothes and belongings gone. Wrapping himself in a nearby quilt, he pieced together the events: the rose wine at Amelie’s inn must have been drugged.

“That wine was poisoned!” he exclaimed, though part of him resisted blaming the beautiful Amelie. But the evidence was clear—his silver, hidden banknotes, even his jade pendant had vanished. Bandit behavior from a woman he’d trusted!

Shivering, Lin Chen stumbled downhill barefoot, the frozen terrain tearing his feet. Cursing, he stepped on a human vertebra amidst graves, screaming in horror. Forced onward, his feet grew bloodied and numb. A venomous snake bite worsened his plight—his right foot swelling grotesquely. Using spiritual energy to suppress the toxin, he barely survived the night.

**Chapter 4456: Poisoned**

At dawn, Lin Chen surveyed his mangled feet—lacerated, swollen, the right foot still oozing dark blood from the snakebite. Though he’d expelled most venom, residual poison throbbed painfully. Hungry, cold, and headache-ridden, he faced an impossible journey back.

Weeping bitterly, he cursed fate and Amelie, vowing revenge. Using a willow branch as a crutch, he hobbled forward, each step agony. The morning sun brought little warmth, only the mocking chatter of birds. In that desolate wilderness, salvation seemed a distant hope.
