Everyone in the grand hall listened in complete silence as Guan Yu recounted his tale. He continued, "When we entered Miaocheng, we were utterly stunned. We found ourselves in an unknown location, and most perplexingly, our entry points were scattered. Of our sixteen-member group, only six remained together initially. We gradually regrouped through chance encounters, yet several junior brothers vanished from start to finish, never emerging. I fear... accidents befell them."

"What are you implying, Guan Yu?" Elder Xiang abruptly interjected. "Are you saying we don't even know how my disciples died? That their bodies vanished without trace?" Two of the missing had been his proteges - the only disciples he'd sent on this mission who never even glimpsed Miaocheng's visage.

Guan Yu regarded him coldly. "Your disciples never saw Miaocheng. They perished during a sudden tempest before reaching the city." This blunt statement carried deliberate provocation. Though Elder Xiang's current anger stemmed more from grief than true fury - Left Sky Peak already had the fewest disciples in Cloud Azure Sect, each loss cutting deep.

Of the original twenty Cloud Azure disciples dispatched, only eleven returned. Ling Chen and Ling Su's fates remained unknown, while the rest had likely met their ends.

Elder Xiang snorted but held his tongue. Having witnessed Guan Yu's capabilities, he saw no gain in open confrontation, maintaining only superficial opposition.

"We encountered a catastrophic sandstorm in the desert," Guan Yu resumed. "Were it not for a companion's aid, we'd have been wiped out." Though none doubted this, their interest lay not in weather but Miaocheng's mysteries.

Elder Dai rose, her maternal concern evident. "Siqi, describe how you survived that storm." While others bore sun-blackened exhaustion, the young female disciple appeared relatively unscathed - perhaps benefiting from protective camaraderie.

As Siqi explained their ordeal, particular credit went to Xiao Mei (though identified only as the Heterodox Cult's leader, omitting her demonic nature) and Guan Yu's quick thinking with rescue ropes.

Master Xuanming pressed, "Didn't you begin searching immediately in Miaocheng?"

"Master, you misunderstand that realm's nature," Guan Yu replied. "An expansive isolated domain teeming with primordial beasts beyond individual combat. We landed on its periphery, forced to regroup cautiously. The area swarmed with Demon Soul Sect, Crimson Lotus Sect, True Sun Gate, and other cultivators - all either battling rivals or beasts. Our fortune came through meeting a demon girl who revealed Miaocheng's true core - a city of high-ranking demons surrounded by mountains housing shape-shifting beasts forbidden from entering until achieving human form."

Xuanming murmured, "Such order in a demon city... unexpected. Continue."

"Guided by her, we glimpsed Miaocheng's heart. But the demon chieftain expelled us, forcing retreat. Following clues from the poem - 'When flowers bloom, fragrance carries afar' - we sought the Eight-Sided Drum technique. Later, we witnessed Demon Soul Sect's Right Envoy rout Crimson Lotus Sect near a waterfall. Suspecting the site's significance..." Guan Yu paused, strategizing how to describe subsequent events.

Elder Lu interjected, "You encountered Demon Soul Sect yet avoided conflict?"

"Wisdom prevailed," Guan Yu nodded. "We numbered ten against their elite cadre - even junior officers being masters. Moreover, they'd stationed forces at the desert portal, knowing lesser disciples were useless inside. The Right Envoy, weary from battle, showed no hostility." This plausible fabrication hid their true dealings.

He continued, "Exploring the waterfall's cave led to a chamber housing a gorilla-like monster - the Miaocheng chieftain. Demon Soul Sect forces slew it during our struggle. In an inner sanctum, we found peculiar artifacts... until everything crumbled to ash, leaving floating words: 'Longevity's Birth, Radiant Son of Heaven, Snow Veils the Golden Hall, Fate Reveals the Divine Art.'"

Xuanming sprang up. "This clearly guides us to the next technique!" His redundant pronouncement earned nods from fellow elders.

When pressed about subsequent events, Guan Yu omitted the bloodstone discovery. Though initially intending to present it as consolation for failing the main mission, Xuanming's callous disregard changed his mind - the stone would remain his secret.

Chapter 4684: Lasting Impressions

"After escaping, we witnessed Crimson Lotus and True Sun Gate battling over a head-sized bloodstone," Guan Yu explained. "A treasure for refining supreme artifacts, per our archives."

"Why didn't you seize it?" Xuanming demanded.

"With mere ten against their dozens?" Guan Yu countered bitterly. "You gave us scant manpower, Master. We'd have been crushed."

Xuanming conceded privately - perhaps sending Elder Lu's contingent might have succeeded. Still, all factions leaving empty-handed mitigated failure.

As discussion turned to the cryptic verses, contradictions emerged. The emperor's birthday (October 1st - Cold Clothing Festival) conflicted with "Snow Veils the Golden Hall," autumnal date incompatible with snowfall. Yet Guan Yu insisted the phrases were accurate, witnessed by multiple parties.

Elder Zheng noted, "The Cold Clothing Festival honors departed ancestors with winter garments. How does snow feature then?" The paradox hung unresolved as plans turned toward the capital - the apparent next stage in their celestial treasure hunt.
