“Brother, look over there, there’s a boat! Let’s go for a ride, okay?” Suddenly, Zhao Jing’er pointed to a distant waterway and exclaimed excitedly.

“Today you’re the boss—do whatever you want!” Guan Yu said with a smile.

“Thank you, Brother! You’re the best!” Zhao Jing’er clapped her hands happily.

Guan Yu feigned a stern expression. “I already told you, no more ‘thank yous.’ Remember, I’m your brother. Don’t treat me like an outsider, or I’ll get angry!”

Zhao Jing’er playfully stuck out her tongue and skipped ahead, clutching her camera.

The ancient Jiangnan town had a network of waterways winding through quaint, rustic buildings, flanked by shops selling all sorts of goods. Tourists gliding along in boats could browse merchandise, purchase souvenirs, and enjoy local cultural performances—a feast for the eyes.

The waterways were one of the main attractions drawing visitors to the town.

“How many boats should we hire?” Guan Yu turned to the group as they reached the shore.

“Heh, my wife and I need a boat for some *quality time*. You guys figure it out yourselves!” Tian Hao stepped forward, smirking as he wrapped an arm around Hu Yuhan.

Guan Yu shot him a knowing look, then turned to Niu Le and Wang Zhen. “What about you two? Want to join us on a bigger boat?”

Niu Le and Wang Zhen exchanged glances and sighed in unison.

Who’d want to third-wheel a couple’s romantic boat ride? Let alone two heartbroken souls already drowning in misery?

“Let’s just stick together and spare ourselves the agony,” Wang Zhen said, slinging an arm around Niu Le’s neck.

“Fine, but keep your hands off my ass!” Niu Le grumbled.

“Darling, my ass is for *smashing*, not groping!” Wang Zhen teased, leaping back with exaggerated dramatics.

“Get lost!” Guan Yu barked, fists clenched.

*Damn these clowns!*

Ignoring them, Guan Yu boarded a boat with Wenqing, Mo Ling, and Zhao Jing’er.

As they drifted along, Zhao Jing’er snapped photos furiously, eager to capture every moment.

“Hubby, let’s take a selfie!” Wenqing pulled Guan Yu close, pressing her lips to his cheek as the camera clicked.

“You’re taking advantage of me,” Guan Yu joked, feigning innocence.

“Relax, I’ll take responsibility,” Wenqing quipped.

“But I’m married!” Guan Yu turned to Mo Ling. “Right, darling?”

Mo Ling gritted her teeth. “Both of you, stop being disgusting!”

Suddenly, the boat lurched violently.

“Captain, steady the boat!”

Blame the captain? Hardly.

The real fault lay with Guan Yu—his flirting had distracted everyone.

The boatman, caught in the drama, discreetly gave Guan Yu a thumbs-up.

Meanwhile, Niu Le and Wang Zhen watched gloomily from another boat.

“This world’s gone mad. How’s getting dumped this painful?” Wang Zhen groaned.

“Should’ve never come here,” Niu Le muttered.

Elsewhere, Tian Hao and Hu Yuhan’s boat drifted by, their affection a salt rub on fresh wounds.

“Let’s execute dorm ‘justice’ on Tian Hao later,” Wang Zhen suggested.

“I’ll change my underwear twice daily to prepare!” Niu Le vowed.

Unbeknownst to Tian Hao, his romantic cruise would end in a world of pain.

“Move aside?”

Wu Shungang scoffed. “In Jiangnan, others yield to *me*. You’re blocking my path!”

He turned to Wang Siyu with a smile. “Wait here, I’ll handle this.”

To Wu, this was a chance to impress Wang Siyu.

“Get lost before I lose my temper!” he barked at the obstructing boat.

“*You* get lost,” Wang Zhen retorted.

“You’re pushing your luck,” Wu sneered.

Niu Le bristled. “Move or we’ll toss you overboard!”

The boatman froze, regretting ever taking this job.

“You’ll regret this,” Wu hissed, pulling out his phone.

Wang Siyu intervened. “He’s my ex. Let me handle it.”

Wu smirked, eyeing Wang Zhen. “So you’re the ex? Let’s settle this cleanly—I don’t wear secondhand shoes.”

Wang Siyu sighed. “Leave. This won’t end well for you.”
