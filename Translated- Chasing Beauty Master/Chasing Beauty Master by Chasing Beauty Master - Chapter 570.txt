Yet Liu Yishou's face remained utterly devoid of anger, as though these events held no relation to him—or as if he had long anticipated them.

Guan Yu could no longer endure Liu's composure. He sprang to his feet, small finger thrust toward a young man in accusation: "What right have you to call Liu Yishou a demon? He isn't! You're the demon—all of you!"

The crowd immediately redirected their hostility toward the boy. The accused youth flushed crimson, snarling, "So this is Chief Bade's son! No wonder such ill manners! Boy, do you know whose company you keep?"

Without waiting for reply, the man continued mockingly, "Are you truly ignorant or merely pretending? Every village nearby knows this old wretch caused your mother's death! Her bones lie cold while you consort with her murderer—pitiful! Lamentable!"

"Exactly!" another voice cried. "This child must be tainted too! Perhaps both are demon-possessed!"

The words ignited the crowd. Like explorers discovering new land, they stared at the old man and boy with terrified fascination, as though witnessing true monsters materialize before them.

"You lie!" Guan Yu shouted, fists trembling. "Liu Yishou had no part in Mother's death! When I'm grown, I'll uncover the truth myself! I forbid your slander!"

Hearing this, an onlooker shook his head. "Remarkable—this child defends an unrelated old man repeatedly. Why?"

"What else but shared demonhood?" came the sneering reply. "Today we'll expel both monsters from Jiangkou Manor!"

Facing renewed hostility, Guan Yu's heart pounded. Though merely twelve winters old, his composure rivaled youths five years his senior. Yet none pitied him—most deemed his predicament self-inflicted. To them, only a demon would defend another.

**Chapter 1443: Conflict**

As accusations swirled, a familiar voice cut through the crowd—one Guan Yu had heard a thousand times since childhood. His father, Chief Bade.

"Have you no shame, grown men bullying a child?"

Guan Yu froze, then brightened. Unlike usual reproaches, his father now shielded him from outsiders. The boy's heart swelled—with paternal support, matters might yet resolve.

"Chief Bade," a protester countered, "don't shield your cub without hearing why we act!"

The chief ignored him. "Whatever his errors, he's my son. His discipline is mine alone."

The man scoffed, "Jiangkou is our home! Should we ignore threats to its safety? Would you risk all for one boy?"

Cheers erupted. "Our lives mean nothing to you?" "We'll defend our manor to the death!"

The black-clad instigator basked in approval. Chief Bade seethed—a man who couldn't protect family was worthless. Yet Guan Yu never resented his father, considering him life's greatest teacher despite others' might.

The chief's resolve hardened. Harm would reach his son only over his corpse.

Tension crackled between factions. Though forty winters old, Bade remained formidable—his past glory undimmed after two decades.

Liu Yishou stirred uneasily. Though not directly responsible, these troubles stemmed from his presence. He owed the chief aid. Moreover, Guan Yu was his sole normal companion in this village of fearful gazes—an unbearable plight for a former empire's elite.

As spectators anticipated violence, an arrival changed everything.

Here, magic outshone technology. Common folk coveted mystical skills and rare spell scrolls, yet true mastery proved arduous. Many aspired, but few attained magehood—let alone the equally prestigious alchemist path.

Mages ranked across ten tiers, the pinnacle being the legendary Grand Taboo—a spell existing only in myths. Alternatives required fortune's favor: patronage from masters or gold-heavy purchases of advanced elixirs and spell scrolls. Both paths eluded ordinary families.

Guan Yu inhabited this extraordinary continent, yet dwelled in mundane circumstances.

"Well, well! Seems chaos brews without me!"

The newcomer's voice triggered Guan Yu's sudden clarity—past memories flooding back...

**Chapter 1444: Return to Academia**

When moon and sun share celestial longitude, we call it New Moon. Lunar Day One—when the satellite hides between earth and star. Guan Yu closed his laptop, collapsing breathlessly onto bed. Mother's voice pierced his door: "Chenchen! Help paste New Year couplets!"

New Year's Eve already? While others celebrated, Guan Yu's mind swirled with visions of primitive humans. Three years prior, to pursue goddess Xia Yue'er, he'd abandoned STEM strengths for archaeology—specifically human evolution.

They say interest breeds mastery. Lacking passion for ruins, Guan Yu suffered through university. Only Professor Xia's occasional tutelage (Yue'er's father) saved him from academic ruin.

Next semester's final phase would send two top students abroad. Xia Yue'er naturally claimed one slot through merit and connections. The other... Guan Yu pinched his thigh—reality's bitterness!

The phone rang. "Yes, dear... what now?"

"Who's your 'dear'? Slacking again?"

"I just lay down—"

"No excuses! Listen well, Bai Idiot—fail to secure that exchange spot, and I'll never date you!"

"Not this again!"

Though peers saw them as couple, Xia Yue'er had never formally accepted him. Her "when you're adequate" condition remained mysteriously undefined.

"Enough jokes," she continued. "Check the news!"

Guan Yu reopened his laptop. A headline blazed: "10,000-Year-Old Human Site Found in Northern City"—his own municipality! While mundane to most, this electrified archaeology students. Xia Yue'er's voice trilled through the receiver: "See? The site! If we'd known earlier..."

"You mean... visit it?"

"Smart boy! Meet me tomorrow—8 AM, usual spot. New Year's Day won't stop us!"

Before protests formed, she hung up. Mother's roar followed: "Guan Yu! No dinner if you don't help!"

Sighing, he muttered: "Two impossible women."

**Chapter 1445: Love Rival?**

Dawn's call came via Xia Yue'er's summons. Guan Yu gulped breakfast and raced to her apartment square—7:30 AM. Northern winter gnawed bones. Few braved the plaza's cold. Guan Yu paced, breath steaming, eyes fixed on her building.

A silver BMW's horn shattered stillness. Two men emerged—lead figure tall and sleek in white designer wear; hulking bodyguard in black trailed. The dandy locked eyes with Guan Yu, smirking. "Well met, Bai... ah, Guan Yu! My memory falters lately."

Guan Yu turned away. Trouble brewed.

The bodyguard loomed. "Boy! The young master addresses you!"

"Silence!" The dandy feigned courtesy. "My apologies—servants forget manners. Might you be waiting for someone?"

Guan Yu kept watching Xia Yue'er's direction.

"Perhaps," the man gestured grandly, "you'd prefer warming in my car?"

"No thanks."

The dandy's eyes hardened following Guan Yu's gaze. "How provincial—still awaiting buses?"

"Finished?"

"You disrespectful—"

"Who lets dogs bark for masters?"

A clear voice rang out: "Stop!" Both turned to see Xia Yue'er running—azure down jacket, ponytail flying. "Guan Yu! Are you hurt?"

He smiled. "Fine. Let's go."

"Wait." She wheeled on the intruders. The dandy, Li Tian, oozed false charm. "Miss Xia! What fortunate timing!"
