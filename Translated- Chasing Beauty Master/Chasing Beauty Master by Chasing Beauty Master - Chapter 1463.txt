Though the matter of Gao Xin had been mentioned, Wang Xiaorong couldn't help feeling sorrowful at Guan Yu's impending departure. She asked, "Guan Yu, when have you decided to leave?"

Guan Yu glanced at the darkened sky outside—it was already midnight. "I'll depart at dawn tomorrow. Don't blame me for hurrying, but Xiao Zhi's life hangs by a thread. He needs me to return and save him."

Wang Xiaorong nodded understandingly. "Very well. I'll come to see you off tomorrow morning. You're right—Xiao Zhi's life takes precedence. An early return is best." This reasonable, empathetic nature of hers was precisely why Guan Yu found Wang Xiaorong so agreeable.

Though usually fiery-tempered, willful, and playful, Wang Xiaorong never hindered crucial matters—this being her greatest virtue.

At daybreak, Wang Xiaorong escorted Guan Yu to the gates of the Demon Soul Sect. With concern, she said, "If you encounter trouble, return here. This will always be your home. Should those old fogies from the Cloud Azure Sect dare bully you, come tell me—I'll teach them a lesson myself."

"Mm, I'll remember. Don't worry—I'll be fine. Go back now," Guan Yu replied with a smile.

Wang Xiaorong produced a bundle, handing it over. "Supplies for the journey, and two sets of clothes I made. The distance to Cloud Azure Sect is great—keep these for the road."

Accepting the warm bundle, Guan Yu gently kissed her forehead. "Thank you. I know you lost sleep these past nights sewing. Look—dark circles under your eyes, like a little panda."

"A what? What kind of bear?"

Realizing this world might lack pandas, Guan Yu explained, "In my homeland, pandas are bear-like creatures—gentle and adorable."

"Truly? Then you must take me to see them someday."

"Without doubt," Guan Yu vowed. "Time grows short. Return now—I must depart."

"Journey safely." Wang Xiaorong made no attempt to delay him, knowing his heart already raced back to Cloud Azure Sect. Any delay might endanger Xiao Zhi further.

Upon returning, she encountered the Demon Sovereign, who curiously inquired, "You sent Guan Yu away? Yesterday you opposed his leaving."

Wang Xiaorong coldly replied, "He's gone—exactly as you wished."

"Merely expedient words. Did he leave willingly?"

"Since you threatened expulsion, I persuaded him first. Better this than having him resent me for your actions." Her words deceived—the truth remained unspoken.

The Demon Sovereign chuckled. "My daughter matures, aiding her father's plans. Guan Yu's pride wouldn't permit lingering once aware. But now departing, doesn't this make him Cloud Azure's traitor?"

"Perhaps. Regardless, even branded traitor, he'll never join Demon Soul Sect. Abandon that hope."

"Who knows? Perhaps for your shared happiness, when Cloud Azure rejects him..." The Demon Sovereign's smile turned sly.

"May your schemes bear fruit." Wang Xiaorong departed without another glance.

At Cloud Azure Sect, all disciples gathered in Tiger Head Peak's vast courtyard—over a thousand practitioners assembled. Sect Leader Xuan Ming stood on the hall steps beside his chief disciple Yan Zhao, whose prestige nearly matched his master's.

Xuan Ming raised a hand for silence. "All sect members are present. Headmasters—confirm your disciples' attendance."

Headmaster Dai stepped forward. "All Gathering Peak members present—even comatose Shi Zhen was carried here."

Headmaster Xiang of Left Void Peak asked, "Senior Brother, why summon everyone? Do we march against demonic sects?"

"All in time. Are Left Void disciples accounted for?"

"Every breathing soul attends," Xiang confirmed, though puzzled by the unprecedented gathering.

Headmaster Mu of Bamboo Grove Peak reported, "One disciple remains guarding Xiao Zhi."

Headmaster Lu interjected, "My suggestion—better safe than endangered. The guard is trustworthy."

Xuan Ming nodded. "Name this disciple to exclude during roll call."

"Wang Jun—the disciple you assigned to Bamboo Grove Peak," Mu replied. "All others attend, including confined disciples from other peaks."

"Release them temporarily for roll call," Xuan Ming ordered. "After proceedings, recommence their confinement."

Wang Jun, aware today's inspection would expose his Blood Toxin corruption, had schemed to avoid attendance. Through Lu's intervention, he remained guarding Xiao Zhi—a arrangement granting him escape routes should recall orders come.

Headmaster Zheng then spoke bitterly, "My unfilial son Xiao Zhi alone absents." His emphasized "unfilial" drew silent disapproval from the crowd.

After verifying Tiger Head Peak's full attendance, Xuan Ming announced, "We commence roll call. When named, move to the eastern courtyard. Let none escape scrutiny."

The sprawling courtyard easily accommodated the shifting masses. Hours later, Xuan Ming concluded, "All present match our records. Henceforth, only these names represent true Cloud Azure disciples. Report any imposters for rich rewards."

He continued gravely, "Days past, Xiao Zhi transformed into black-furred monstrosity. Investigation reveals grave truth—he suffers Blood Toxin from the annihilated Black Blood Ridge. This poison transforms victims monthly unless suppressed by antidote. Demonic sects now use it to control spies—including infiltrators among us!"

Gasps swept through disciples. Yan Zhao paled—this revelation jeopardized his hidden allegiance.

Producing spirit beast scales, Xuan Ming declared, "All except Headmasters and myself shall undergo inspection. Yan Zhao and I will conduct examinations."

Headmaster Lu objected, "For fairness, none should be exempt—including Headmasters and Yan Zhao."

Though initially resistant, Xuan Ming acquiesced. As examinations commenced, Lu whispered to Yan Zhao during his turn, "Your deception ends here."

Yan Zhao's face whitened—how had Lu discovered his secret? Had Xiao Zhi revealed something during rescue? The trap snapped shut—universal inspection left no escape.
