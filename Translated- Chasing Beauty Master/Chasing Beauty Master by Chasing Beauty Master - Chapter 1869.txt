“This matter is entirely the fault of the consort,” the Princess Royal muttered. “He insisted on sending people to search for that Eastern Sea treasure. What use is all the wealth in the Eastern Sea? If anything happens to Xin’er, I’ll make him pay!”

Prince Zou interjected, “With the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl in our possession, how could we not seek the treasure? Your Highness should not blame the consort. It was only natural. Could he have simply handed over the Dragon Pearl?”

“He himself warned of dangers,” the Princess Royal retorted angrily. “Especially since Xin’er loves to wander about the capital. He deliberately spread the rumor that we had already presented the Dragon Pearl to His Majesty, yet still these troubles arose. Now all blame falls on Jiang Yuankai—he has only himself to fault!”

“Had we truly given the Dragon Pearl to Father earlier, at least Xin’er wouldn’t be in danger now,” the Princess Royal fumed.

Prince Zou countered, “I must disagree, Your Majesty and Princess. The entire court knows Your Majesty’s most cherished daughter remains the Princess Royal, while Princess Jiang Xin is now the apple of His Majesty’s eye. Even if the Dragon Pearl had been presented, desperate outlaws would still target your household. Kidnapping palace members is difficult, but outside... Princess Jiang Xin is the only hostage valuable enough to demand the Dragon Pearl.”

“Prince Zou speaks wisely,” the Emperor concurred. “Truthfully, aside from my dear Xin’er, few in this world would compel me to trade the Dragon Pearl. The secrets it guards outweigh any single life.”

The Princess Royal gradually saw reason. Xin’er’s unique status made her the inevitable target, regardless of where the Dragon Pearl resided. “I pray they’re not mistreating her,” she murmured, gazing anxiously beyond the palace walls.

Prince Zou offered reassurance: “Grand Steward Yu Kong’s elite troops are efficient. With tens of thousands scouring the capital, results will come swiftly.”

Meanwhile, Consort Jiang Yuankai could no longer remain idle. Personally leading a battalion, he ordered door-to-door searches as dusk fell. News of the kidnapping spread like wildfire through the panicked capital, reaching every humble alleyway.

Qin Huan, returning with a fishing village caravan, had just stationed watchers near Black Gate Manor when the city gates slammed shut. Learning of the lockdown, he hurried home to consult his father.

“Who dares challenge imperial authority so brazenly?” Qin Huan demanded.

Old Master Qin stroked his beard. “The target is clearly the Dragon Pearl. Xin’er is but a pawn. Whether His Majesty would trade that cosmic secret for her life... even I cannot guess.”

Chapter 4913: Secrets Cannot Stay Hidden

“You err, my son,” Master Qin corrected. “The Dragon Pearl never reached the Emperor. It remains with Jiang Yuankai. He and the Princess would surely trade it for Xin’er.”

“But didn’t the Princess present it publicly?” Qin Huan questioned.

“A ruse!” The old man chuckled darkly. “By diverting attention to the impregnable palace, Jiang Yuankai covertly investigates the treasure’s location. Clever, yet...”

“Yet secrets cannot stay hidden forever. His movements attract notice, especially among mercenary jianghu circles. Those wolves scenting limitless wealth will stop at nothing.”

Qin Huan’s eyes narrowed. “Then the kidnappers must know the Pearl stays with Jiang Yuankai?”

“Precisely. This narrows our suspects. I’d thought reckless jianghu ruffians, but how would outsiders learn such guarded truths? The plot thickens...”

Meanwhile, Tang Muchen abandoned his wine at Oceanic Tavern upon hearing the commotion. Finding his merchant father stranded outside sealed gates, he contemplated solutions until interrupted by Duan Ruxue’s unexpected visit.

At a modest teahouse, Duan Ruxue probed: “When imperial troops search your estate, how will you respond?”

“We’ll welcome them,” Tang Muchen shrugged. “Cooperation proves innocence. Unlike some, I’ve no interest in court intrigues—better to know where fine wines flow.”

Duan Ruxue sighed at his frivolity as Chapter 4914: Swift Reactions unfolded.

In the Cao Manor, young Cao Di nearly leapt from his skin when soldiers stormed in. “Just a search,” his father soothed once they departed. “We acted swiftly—Xin’er’s already beyond the walls. Once gates reopen, we’ll demand Jiang Yuankai’s trade.”

A servant’s knock announced Qin Master’s summons. “Let him suspect,” Cao Senior sneered. “Without evidence, suspicion is meaningless.” Yet he doubled his guard en route, unaware his son plotted to ravish the captive princess once free to leave.

Elsewhere, Chu Fan raced through backstreets, desperate to warn Guan Yu—the storm’s eye approached.
