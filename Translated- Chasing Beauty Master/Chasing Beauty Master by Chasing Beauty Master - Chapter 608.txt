“A reward?” Guan Yu looked at him in confusion, but before she could process the thought, Akali Li began chanting incantations. Arrays of magical formations flashed before her eyes. A pained cry erupted from Ming Xue as streaks of light burst from her body. Akali Li extended his clawed hands like hooks toward the escaping radiance.

Ming Xue struggled to open her eyes, witnessing the spirit pearls leaving her body. Understanding dawned. “Haha! Akali Li! If I survive, I’ll grind your bones to dust!” So all that warmth had been manipulation! How foolish she’d been! Her mother was right—human hearts are treacherous!

“No!” A roar erupted behind Akali Li. Turning, he saw Ming Hanfeng materialize unexpectedly. “Father! Why?” The youth’s eyes burned with disbelief. Akali Li frowned at his son’s interruption, raising a hand to act.

A sudden hurricane-force wind erupted. Akali Li instantly teleported thousands of feet away, cursing, “Damnation! Why now?” Behind him, Guan Yu shouted at Ming Hanfeng, “Brother, flee! If I survive, I’ll find you!” She sensed imminent danger—perhaps only he and that kind woman on this continent still cared for her. As she willed him to safety, a black vortex swallowed her body.

Ming Hanfeng was blown hundreds of feet away. The black vortex seemed designed solely for Guan Yu. Such a shocking spectacle could only be witnessed once in a lifetime!

**Chapter 1542: The Marsh**

Atop a stinking swamp, two factions faced off. The black-clad leader coldly addressed the wounded flood dragon: “Surrender the artifact.” The dragon spat human words: “Never!” Though gravely injured, it refused submission.

A falling figure crashed onto the dragon’s head, plunging into the mire. Combatants froze as the inky swamp began shifting colors—crimson and viridian swirling together. The dragon’s expression twisted oddly while the demonic cultivators gaped in confusion.

Beneath the swamp, Guan Yu felt blood draining from her body. An excited voice echoed in her mind: “Child, use your energy!” The dragon encouraged desperately as the marsh’s colors intensified.

Clutching her last shred of resolve, Guan Yu mobilized elemental forces—wind, thunder, earth—until confronting a blood-red glow. A crimson whip greedily devoured her energy. Was this her end?

No!

As despair gripped her, the Soul-Devouring Whip suddenly ceased absorption, floating docilely. Guan Yu gasped in relief, shaking her dizzy head. A triumphant roar erupted above: “Hahaha! Freedom at last!” The black dragon soared skyward, reveling in liberated power. For years trapped here, it had been reduced to a blood-harvesting slave for the whip—now finally released!

Guan Yu stared dumbfounded as the dragon addressed the demons below: “Taste my newfound strength!”

“Demonic Torrent Surge!” Black watery energy erupted from its maw like tidal waves.

But as the attack prepared to strike, crimson light exploded from the swamp. The dragon recoiled in terror—this scene mirrored its ancient entrapment! Demons scrambled back as the marsh’s glow intensified.

A fiery figure burst from the mire—a crimson-haired girl with matching eyes, wielding a barbed whip that chilled the soul. Guan Yu smirked unnervingly, having observed the battle below. This lawless land suited her trial by fire. Her transformation began here.

Demons rallied, awestruck: “How did she survive the Death Marsh?” Landing gracefully, Guan Yu declared: “Submit or perish.” Her calm tone brooked no argument.

“You? Impossible!”

“Then you choose death.” She raised the whip. The dragon gasped: “S-Soul-Devouring Whip!”

“Dark Moon Scourge!” Guan Yu’s petite hands danced. The whip serpentined through demons, each contact drawing screams and blood. When she finally paused, licking blood from her lips, the survivors chanted: “Asura! Asura!”

In this strength-worshipping world, power commanded loyalty. Guan Yu’s cold gaze fell on the dragon—it had saved her for selfish ends. She’d spare it... unless provoked.

At the marsh’s heart stood a crimson-clad figure, red locks cascading to her waist, eyes like frozen rubies. The dragon transformed into a black-haired man approaching remorsefully: “My lady, you’ve emerged.” Four years ago, he’d pledged service, witnessing her meteoric rise.

Guan Yu nodded. His vigilant guardianship had earned tentative trust—though she could now crush any betrayal.

Elsewhere in the demon realm, a cloaked youth addressed a magic circle: “Father, must you test this yourself?”

An older man sighed: “This portal’s destination is unknown. If dangerous, I can survive until recall.” As the youth left, the man murmured: “What truly matters to you, my son?” Stepping through, he vanished—unnoticed by a crimson observer.

**Chapter 1543: Vanished Secrets**

The vines restraining Guan Yu suddenly loosened. A gentle energy coalesced around her. Closing her eyes, she found herself in a luminous sea, white sparks triggering memories—childhood joys with her royal parents, displaying powers to Ming Hanfeng.

Unbeknownst to her, the nurturing energy intensified. Night Wuchen sensed the change while her master慕容凤羽 marveled at his disciple’s mysteries.

As white light enveloped Guan Yu, transformations occurred—her wings turned alabaster, robes pure white, though hair and eyes remained violet. She emerged like a celestial being, smiling serenely.

The men stared enchanted. Guan Yu healed Night Wuchen and慕容凤羽 with light magic before confronting Hong Feng. Their coordinated attacks overwhelmed the traitor—Night Wuchen’s sword piercing his heart as Guan Yu’s ribbon shredded his body.

But in death, Hong Feng didn’t revert to demon form—he was human! Guan Yu realized: they’d been the only two humans in the Death Abyss. His motives for destruction died with him.

Guan Yu smiled at the sunshine, then mourned the shattered Soul-Devouring Whip—a memento of her lost friend Hu Xiaohai. Night Wuchen embraced her gently amidst the rebuilt world.

Days later, atop city walls, Guan Yu contemplated departure. At an assembly, she announced: “I must leave.”

Night Wuchen gripped her hand: “I forbid it!”

慕容凤羽 demanded: “Give us reason!”

**Chapter 1544: Netherworld Depths**

In the幽冥Abyss, Guan Yu walked with the dragon, pondering: “Why don’t I feel stronger despite surpassing Earth Sovereign?”

“This realm exists beyond cosmic laws. Survival defines strength—as you once proved.”

A black meteor interrupted them. Investigating, they found慕容凤羽 surrounded by demons. Guan Yu observed coldly: “Let’s watch first.” The scholar subtly lured threats away from her position.
