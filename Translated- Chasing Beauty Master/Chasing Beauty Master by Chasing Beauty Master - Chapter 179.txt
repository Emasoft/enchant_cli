The moment the door opened, a refreshing, delicate fragrance wafted out. Guan Yu turned toward the scent and found himself utterly captivated by the sight before him.

Li Xi stood wearing a low-cut black silk nightgown, the cleavage from her 36D figure immediately drawing Guan Yu's gaze. Yet he dared not linger—this woman was far more dangerous than he'd imagined, and he had no desire to remain on her radar.

His eyes trailed downward. The silk gown barely covered a fraction of her long legs, leaving most of her pale, shapely thighs exposed. Guan Yu swallowed hard at the sight of their perfect curves.

Her jade-like feet, delicate and translucent, surpassed even Du Xiaojuan's in their exquisite beauty. Guan Yu yearned to cradle them in his hands.

After a lingering glance, his gaze finally settled on her face.

Stripped of her daytime makeup, Li Xi's features lacked their usual icy allure but gained a natural, fresh beauty—a different kind of visual impact, yet equally breathtaking. She resembled a lotus emerging from water, ethereal as a celestial maiden.

She stood drying her damp hair with a towel, her eyes narrowing slightly as she stared at Guan Yu.

"You'd look even better with a hint of a smile," Guan Yu blurted out involuntarily.

Li Xi's cheeks flushed with suppressed anger at his blatantly admiring stare.

Her current attire had been a reluctant choice—Guan Yu's urgent knocking had made her think he had critical matters to discuss.

Meeting his gaze directly, she asked softly, "Is something the matter?"

Guan Yu averted his eyes and nodded. "Yes, I need to discuss something. Is now convenient?"

"What do you think?" Li Xi countered.

"Ah... Perhaps not," Guan Yu admitted honestly.

Li Xi moved to close the door, but Guan Yu's hand shot out to stop it. She regarded him warily.

"Actually, it's nothing major," he said awkwardly. "I just wanted to mention I have personal matters tomorrow. If there were any plans, it'd be best to cancel them early."

He rushed through the explanation, fearing she might slam the door mid-sentence.

"Oh? I intended to have you rest at home tomorrow anyway. I won't have time for you," Li Xi replied coolly, shutting the door firmly.

Left standing outside, Guan Yu rolled his eyes. So much for his assumptions.

What a pity—such beauty deserved longer appreciation. Still, he counted himself luckier than most men.

Troubled by various concerns, Guan Yu slept fitfully that night.

**Chapter 442: Disappearance?**

By morning, dark circles shadowed his eyes. Descending the stairs, he found Li Yuanshan and his daughter already breakfasting.

Noticing Guan Yu's fatigue, Li Yuanshan inquired, "Younger Brother Guan, did you sleep poorly?"

"Not too bad," Guan Yu demurred, joining them. "Come, try Xi Xi's cooking," Li Yuanshan urged cheerfully.

Throughout the meal, Li Xi wore a contemplative expression.

"Elder Brother, might I borrow a car today?" Guan Yu asked Li Yuanshan.

"You're going out?"

"Yes, some business to attend to."

"Take the Mercedes in the garage. Xi Xi will give you the keys," Li Yuanshan agreed without hesitation.

Post-breakfast, Li Xi handed Guan Yu the keys in the garage. "If you need help..." she trailed off meaningfully.

Guan Yu stiffened. How had she sensed his troubles? Admiring her perceptiveness, he feigned nonchalance. "What trouble? I'm in a hurry."

As the Mercedes sped away, Guan Yu inserted the miniature earpiece Zhao Zilong had provided. Pressing his phone's button established a connection with Tian Xun.

"Brother Tian, any sign of Lin Dong?"

"Not yet. Are you certain he'll find you?"

"Uncertain. If he's as skilled as reported, he shouldn't miss me. We'll proceed regardless."

Guan Yu frowned. "An amusement park? With crowds?"

Tian Xun's voice remained steady. "Precisely. He targets only the corrupt, avoids innocents. Expects hand-to-hand combat—our best chance. Reinforcements are arranged."

"New trackers will blend like chameleons. Place one on him during contact."

Despite reservations, Guan Yu acquiesced. Zhao Zilong's reputation risk moved him.

**Chapter 443: Missing Reinforcements?**

At Shidini Amusement Park, Guan Yu wandered amidst winter-defying crowds. A nearby boy's laughter caught his attention—a mother briefly entrusted her son while visiting restrooms.

When cartoon characters approached, the boy dashed toward a Mickey Mouse performer. Moments later, the mother's panicked cries pierced the air—her child had vanished.

"Ma'am, he was right..." Guan Yu began, but the woman cut him off suspiciously.

Following her gaze, Guan Yu froze.

The boy had disappeared.
