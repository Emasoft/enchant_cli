“It’s not as serious as you say,” Wang Xiaorong protested with reluctance. “Though I don’t visit the Cloud Azure Sect often, I’m quite familiar with the place. Even if someone spots me, I have ways to escape. I just wanted to spend more time with you. The Demon Soul Sect suffocates me—Left Envoy and Xiao Bai aren’t around, and there’s no one to play with.”

Guanyu asked, “Oh? They’re all gone. Did you go out to handle some matter?”

Wang Xiaorong chuckled, eyeing him. “You’re not probing for Demon Soul Sect secrets, are you? Not that I mind telling you. They’ve gone to the great desert in search of Miao City.”

“You also know the Eight-Sided Drum Art points to Miao City? How did you find out? Don’t tell me our Cloud Azure Sect leaked this to you?”

Guanyu’s mind raced. This information was supposed to be known only to the sect’s upper echelons. If the Demon Soul Sect had discovered it, the Cloud Azure Sect must be fracturing internally.

“Of course not!” Wang Xiaorong looped her arm through his as they sat down. “Father found clues in Patriarch Menghua’s journals. Later, Old Sun provided more details.”

“Shouldn’t I be asking *you* how *you* learned of Miao City? Don’t say you guessed—I won’t believe that,” she countered.

Guanyu smiled. “I’m not that clever. I’ve only been here a short while—even with clues, I couldn’t have pieced it together. It was Elder Jiu who connected ‘beneath the Golden City’ to Miao City.”

Sensing she knew more, Guanyu pressed, “What kind of place is Miao City? How can it exist in that vast desert? Can people truly survive long in such harsh conditions?”

“It’s not what you think. Miao City isn’t a human settlement,” Wang Xiaorong explained freely, unafraid of him sharing this with the sect—a mark of her trust. “It’s a city of demons, housing all manner of demonic beings. Your Elder Jiu, knowing its stories, must understand its nature.”

Guanyu nodded. “Elder Jiu mentioned it doesn’t welcome humans—a realm solely for demons. He once tracked a wounded wolf demon there.”

“Is that all you know? There’s much more.” Wang Xiaorong leaned closer. “Miao City doesn’t dwell in the desert year-round. Old Sun says it only manifests there on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The rest of the time, it resides in the Demon Realm.”

“The Demon Realm? Miao City belongs there?” Though surprised, Guanyu found this plausible in a world where demonic and mystical realms coexisted.

“Yes. Miao City is one of the Demon Realm’s major capitals—its equivalent of our imperial city, bustling and populous,” she elaborated.

“Did Old Sun tell you all this?” Guanyu inquired. “This ‘Old Sun’—is he Master Sun from the Qin Estate? A fox demon? And if I’m right, partnered with a white fox demon?”

Wang Xiaorong nodded. “Observant as ever. They’re the only two demons in the Demon Soul Sect. Father saved their lives long ago, so they serve him in gratitude.”

“Then Old Sun’s knowledge of Miao City suggests he’s from there?” Guanyu deduced.

“Correct again. He and his grandson Xiao Bai hail from Miao City, though they haven’t returned in years. They possess a method to enter, but it’s been untested for some time. Old Sun is currently verifying if it still works in the desert.”

Wang Xiaorong added, “Their method relies on demonic senses humans lack—detecting the Demon Realm’s shifting coordinates within the sands.”

“Seems the Cloud Azure Sect can’t compete with your Demon Soul Sect this time,” Guanyu remarked. “With such advantages—demonic guides and Patriarch Menghua’s records—even our entire sect mobilizing couldn’t match your speed.”

“Not necessarily,” Wang Xiaorong countered. “Finding Miao City isn’t guaranteed. Old Sun says desert dangers abound, and the portal to the Demon Realm drifts unpredictably. Demons have unique ways to locate it, but this expedition merely tests their method—they’re not seeking entry yet, as the Demon Realm remains hostile to humans.”

“When *will* you search? And why does Miao City only appear on the fifteenth?”

“The seventh month’s fifteenth holds the year’s strongest yin energy,” she explained. “On this day, the realms intersect. Miao City surfaces in the desert to absorb yin qi—like sunbathing. That’s all I know.”

“So the only window is that single day each year?” Guanyu confirmed.

“Exactly.”

Sighing, Guanyu mused, “To think the Eight-Sided Drum Art’s second volume requires such timing. Why would Patriarch Menghua hide it there? So inconvenient.”

“For an immortal like him, traversing realms was trivial. Knowing of Miao City isn’t surprising.”

Guanyu pieced together clues: “Midsummer’s heat... desert glowing golden under moonlight... ‘Golden City’ makes sense. The ‘season of blooming flowers’ aligns with July’s flora. Following fragrant winds to Divine Stone Mountain—that’s where the art must lie. But one day yearly? Miss it, and wait another year.”

“What’s that brooding look?” Wang Xiaorong teased.

“Just thinking how even if we find Miao City, entering a demon realm hostile to humans seems impossible.”

“True for your sect,” she grinned. “But not ours. With fox demons’ help, we’ll manage.”

Guanyu shrugged. “You’ll have the edge. But July’s months away—much could change.”

Wang Xiaorong probed, “Hasn’t the Cloud Azure Sect sent anyone? Is Xuanming truly so patient?”

“Who says they haven’t? Waves of disciples search the desert—futilely, as we now know.”

“Is Xuanming senile? Why not send you? Others are incompetent fools.”

Guanyu chuckled. “Flattering. Success matters little to me. Let them learn hardship—spoiled disciples need tempering. Many were dispatched. Who knows the casualties?”

“Why so detached?” she pressed. “Don’t you want the second volume? Combined with your first, it might break your mind’s seal!”

“I’ve no interest in their glory hunt. As a confined prisoner, even if summoned, I’d refuse.”

**Chapter 3,597: A Pact**

“Truly unwilling?” Wang Xiaorong pressed. She’d hoped to adventure with him in the perilous desert, but her scheme faltered when he wasn’t deployed.

“The desert’s dangerous. Your father excluded you for safety. Stay put.”

She huffed. “Your sect will send you eventually. Otherwise, we’ll claim the art unchallenged.”

Guanyu laughed. “Your father fears my involvement? Even with fox demons guiding you?”

“There’s something else,” she whispered. “The Eight-Sided Drum Art was refined from a magical artifact Patriarch Menghua obtained in the Demon Realm. Aren’t you curious?”

“Curiosity kills. I’ve no death wish.”

“You’d protect me!” she pleaded. “Please? If your sect sends you, request to go alone! I’ll disguise myself!”

Cornered, Guanyu relented. “If ordered, I’ll seek solitary assignment and notify you. But only then.”

Her eyes sparkled. “A promise!” She’d ensure his deployment through her means.

After lingering despite his protests, she left wistfully. Instead of returning to the sect, she summoned Yan Zhao.

“Young Mistress, your summons?” Yan Zhao’s tone dripped false deference. The proud spy resented serving but remained bound by blood poison.

Wang Xiaorong eyed his tall, cunning frame. “I need you to leak information to your sect.”

“Why me? Many spies serve you.”

Her voice turned icy. “Leave then. When the poison flares, don’t come begging. Left Envoy’s away—no antidote without me.”

Yan Zhao clenched his jaw. “My apologies, Young Mistress. Command me.”

“Better. Another insolent word, and the poison won’t be merciful.”

Swallowing pride, Yan Zhao bowed. “Your humble servant awaits instruction.”

As she outlined her plot, Yan Zhao seethed inwardly. *Once free of this poison, I’ll make you regret every humiliation.*
