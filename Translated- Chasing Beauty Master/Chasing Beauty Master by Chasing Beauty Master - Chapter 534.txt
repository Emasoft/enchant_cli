“Yet, such a peerless sword had been deemed ‘trash’ in Guan Yu’s eyes, leaving many speechless. Some had lived decades without even affording—much less touching—such ‘trash’!

‘Hahaha! Trash? Clearly, you’re a country bumpkin with no taste! Let me enlighten you: this Profound Black Sword is worth tens of thousands of gold coins at minimum. A pauper like you could never afford it! I say you stole it!’

Guan Yu made no effort to refute him, replying mildly, ‘Your reasoning is sound… but only nearly. Guess again!’

Upon hearing this, Locke suddenly exclaimed, ‘I’ve got it! You robbed it! You snatched it from Wei Buqun! I’ve seen this sword in his possession! Am I right?’

Just as Locke preened over his own cleverness, he noticed everyone staring at him. Before he could grasp why, he blustered, ‘Why are you all gaping at me? This wretch stole a divine weapon from humans—he’ll bring disaster upon our elvenkind! Drive him out of the Elven Forest at once!’

Guan Yu burst into laughter at Locke’s farcical display.

‘What’s so funny, you bandit?!’

‘I laugh at your stupidity! You know Wei Buqun is human, yet when you mentioned him, it reminded me to share a tale. Wei Buqun is a Sword King among humans and leader of the Blackwater Mercenaries. I assume you’re all more familiar with that group’s… history of oppressing elves?’

At the mention of Blackwater, some elves below the stage wept bitterly, others cursed with venomous hatred—proof of the mercenaries’ deep scars upon their kind.

Satisfied, Guan Yu pressed on, ‘Now, how is it that the leader of such a vile group… is colluding with the head of our elven guards? Care to explain, Locke?’

Realizing Guan Yu’s implication, Locke hastily denied, ‘Don’t listen to this outsider’s lies! How would I, guardian of elves, have ties to Wei Buqun? I’ve never even met him!’

‘Yet moments ago, you claimed to have seen an identical Profound Black Sword in his possession. Have you forgotten so quickly?’

Cornered, Locke stammered, ‘I—I misremembered! So what if I saw him? As head guard, encountering the Blackwater scum during patrols is natural!’

‘Oh? How curious, then, that Wei Buqun’s account differs from yours. Which liar should we believe?’

‘Nonsense! The bandit is clearly lying! How dare you equate me with him?!’

Guan Yu grinned. ‘So even you deem him a bandit! By that logic, stealing from a bandit can’t be too grievous a sin, yes?’

Locke glared at the Profound Black Sword in Guan Yu’s hand. ‘Enough! I’ll waste no more breath. Be grateful your sword isn’t demonic—or I’d lose all advantage!’

‘Keep your petty advantage. My aim is to kill you at your strongest!’

**Chapter 1352: Kael’s Betrayal**

Locke’s words jolted Guan Yu’s memory. ‘Ah, you’ve reminded me—I nearly forgot. While I’m no expert on demonic swords versus ordinary ones, don’t mistake me for a fool!’

‘And what does that mean?’

Guan Yu sneered. ‘Drop the act, Locke. Will you still hide your secret pact with Wei Buqun?’

At ‘secret pact,’ Locke paled. ‘You slander me, brat! Without proof, I’ll make your death agonizing!’

‘Threats now? Do I look frightened? Let me enlighten you: hiding power isn’t your exclusive skill. A Demonic Profound Black Sword? Can it rival Wei Buqun’s Demonic Sword King form?’

‘Demonic Sword King? You faced a demonized Wei Buqun… and survived?!’ Locke’s eyes bulged in disbelief before snapping toward Kael. ‘Elder Kael! Why wasn’t I informed?!’

Kael stammered, ‘I meant to report yesterday, but tasks piled up…’

Locke trembled. ‘So… the brat speaks truth?’

‘…Yes.’

‘Impossible! A mere Archmage defeating a Demonic Sword King? Did you witness Wei Buqun’s death?’

Kael hesitated. ‘Not directly. But Guan Yu returned unscathed—Wei Buqun would never spare him.’

‘I trust only my eyes. Today, I’ll test this “slayer of Demonic Sword Kings” myself!’

Guan Yu hid his glee—Kael’s unintended endorsement had shaken Locke’s confidence. ‘Draw your blade. Let’s see this demonic sword’s worth.’

With a snarl, Locke roared, ‘DIE!’ Black mist coiled from his sword as his eyes flushed crimson.

‘Boss, beware! His demonification begins!’

Guan Yu nodded, poised to strike.

‘Attack now before full transformation!’ urged a companion.

‘Wait,’ cautioned Bikacat. ‘Locke’s cunning—this reeks of trap.’

Remembering Bikacat’s lightning, Guan Yu ordered, ‘Electrocute him!’

The feline darted beneath Locke, unseen. As demonic energy oozed from Locke’s half-transformed body—toxic even to himself—Bikacat gathered power.

But Locke sensed it. Swinging his sword downward, he roared—then froze, recalling Guan Yu’s prior ambush. He recoiled just as lightning erupted from his blade!

The surge raced up his arm. Though his body was steeled, electricity overwhelmed him. Three seconds later, he collapsed, sword clattering.

Guan Yu laughed, kicking the blade toward the dazed Locke. It halted mid-air—intercepted by Kael.

‘Elder Kael,’ Guan Yu taunted, ‘breaking our duel’s terms already?’

‘Would you have me watch his death?’ Kael retorted. ‘Show mercy, lad. Ruthlessness benefits none.’

‘Were our positions reversed, you’d sing differently. But I understand—you and Locke are… close.’

‘Spare him, then. Let this end.’

‘Only if he surrenders publicly, apologizing to Chief Allen and Elder Shituo.’

**Chapter 1353: Flower Rain Silver Needles**

‘You… go too far!’ Kael hissed, barely containing rage.

‘“Too far” from your lips rings hollow, Elder Kael.’

‘Mind your tongue, outsider! Your ignorance shames you.’

Guan Yu smirked. ‘I merely speak truth. Why so nervous? If you fear for Locke, fight me together! Let’s wager—’

‘You dare challenge me, brat? I’ve decades of experience! You court death!’

The crowd murmured—even besting demonic Locke didn’t mean Guan Yu could face both.

‘Afraid? Admit it! Choices: One, Locke apologizes and lives. Two, we duel to the death.’

Once, such boasts would draw mockery. Now, none doubted Guan Yu’s hidden depths.

As Kael hesitated, Locke shouted, ‘Never yield! I’d die before bowing to this cur!’

‘Brave words from a snake!’ Guan Yu jeered. ‘Bikacat alone could end you.’

At the name, Kael whispered urgently, ‘Locke, must we persist?’

‘Coward! You urged his death earlier!’

‘I never—!’ Kael reddened. ‘Slander me again, and—’

‘Or what?’ Locke sneered. ‘Need I remind you of your family’s fate?’

The crowd gasped—Kael’s loyalty stemmed from hostage kin. Guan Yu’s hatred for Locke deepened.

‘Choose, Kael!’ Locke threatened. ‘Betray me, and they suffer!’

Seizing the rift, Guan Yu called, ‘Join us, Elder Kael! Free yourself!’

Chief Allen added, ‘We’ll pardon past deeds and protect your family!’

Torn, Kael suddenly leapt behind Guan Yu, crying, ‘Shield me!’

Locke unleashed a storm of silver needles—‘Flower Rain Silver Needles!’—as Guan Yu shielded the turncoat.

Thousands of hair-thin needles cascaded toward Kael like lethal rain.
