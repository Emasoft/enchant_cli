“Langduhua (Wolf Poison Flower) wasn’t overly surprised by this, not because she considered Bikamao (Beckoning Cat) weak, but because she had already witnessed Bikamao’s prowess earlier. Hearing Aimi reiterate it now merely confirmed her suspicions.

“‘There’s another secret—yours!’

“‘Mine?’

"Finally, it was her own secret’s turn. At this moment, Aimi felt an inexplicable nervousness. Though she couldn’t see her face, she knew her cheeks must be flushed crimson. This secret had lingered in her heart for ages, never shared with anyone. To others, it might seem trivial gossip, but to her, it held immense significance.

“‘I… I like Brother Dragon!’

"After hesitating for several seconds, these words suddenly burst from Aimi’s lips.

"Langduhua froze upon hearing this. She hadn’t expected Aimi to confide such a secret. But when she noticed the girl’s tightly clenched fists, she couldn’t help but laugh heartily.

"Compared to the first two secrets, this was clearly the one Aimi most wanted to share! As a maiden experiencing first love, she secretly admired a heroic figure nearby, idolizing him as both a role model and a potential future partner. Yet, as a girl, she felt too shy to confess directly. Keeping it bottled up had become unbearable, driving her to unburden her heart to a stranger.

“‘If you like him, why not tell him?’

“‘I don’t know how!’ Aimi replied softly. Though her voice was quiet, Langduhua detected a thread of melancholy within.

“‘Shall I help you?’ Langduhua teased with a mischievous grin.

“‘Ah? N-no, that’s unnecessary.’ Flustered by the jest, Aimi’s face reddened further.

“‘Little one, you spoke so boldly and logically earlier. Why become so timid when it matters?’

"Aimi didn’t retort. Langduhua was right—she felt too bashful about this matter, unwilling to take the initiative. She preferred waiting for fate to intervene.

"Seeing Aimi fall silent, Langduhua sighed. ‘Honestly, what’s so great about that rascal to make a lovely angel like you pine for him? I’ll never understand. Well, since you’ve said your piece, it’s my turn now.’

“‘Yes,’ Aimi murmured, her anxious heart settling. At least her earlier efforts had borne fruit.

“‘Hmm, I’m not sure what to share. Ask me three questions—I’ll answer truthfully.’

“‘Three questions?’ Aimi’s mind spun into disarray. These inquiries were meant to assist Guanyu later, but she had no clue what he truly cared about. She sank into contemplation.

"Just then, a voice sounded at the door: ‘Let me ask!’

"Aimi and Langduhua turned to find none other than Guanyu himself.

“‘When did you get here?’ Langduhua demanded irritably.

“‘I’ve been standing here awhile. You simply didn’t notice.’

“‘What? You’ve been there all along?’ Aimi’s barely calmed heart began racing again, her face heating instantly.

“‘So you heard everything we said earlier?’

"Langduhua immediately grasped Aimi’s implication and turned to Guanyu, awaiting the eavesdropper’s response.

"Infuriatingly, Guanyu ignored Aimi’s question and continued, ‘May I proceed with my inquiry now?’

“‘No! Only Aimi gets to ask—this doesn’t concern you!’ Langduhua snapped.

“‘Oh? Such rules exist? What if Aimi permits me to ask instead?’

“‘You—!’

"Langduhua found herself speechless. Collecting herself, she glanced at Aimi, who now stared at the floor. ‘If she agrees, do as you please!’

“‘Good!’ Guanyu approached Aimi and gently touched her flushed cheek. ‘Aimi, leave the rest to me. Alright?’

"To Langduhua’s astonishment, Aimi nodded silently before exiting the room. Within moments, the maiden’s emotions had shifted yet again.

"Witnessing this, Langduhua could only sigh. This scene proved one thing—Aimi’s feelings for Guanyu ran profoundly deep.

“‘Now that we’re alone, may I begin?’

"Langduhua shot Guanyu a withering glare. ‘You’ve ruined the mood. If not for my promise to Aimi, I’d ignore you entirely.’

"Though her tone remained sharp, Guanyu detected a thaw in her demeanor. The true challenge wasn’t hostility, but silence. As long as she spoke, he could extract useful information.

“‘Where is your Battle Wolf Mercenary Corps headquarters? How many members?’

“‘Why should I tell you? That counts as two questions!’

"When Guanyu ignored her protest, she relented: ‘Karshi City. One hundred members.’

“‘Karshi City?’ As an Earth native, every local地名 felt foreign, yet Guanyu sensed its remoteness. More intriguing was the corps’ size—a mere hundred members for an influential group suggested either utter incompetence or elite exclusivity.

"From his observations, the latter fit. Lang Tianhua’s prowess and arrogance supported this, as did their audacity to target the elves. Though the精灵族’s power had waned, confronting an entire race with a hundred mercenaries required either supreme confidence or sheer madness!

"Guanyu then recalled a crucial axiom: To defeat the enemy, first capture their leader. Knowing the corps leader’s strength would dictate his strategy.

“‘Next, you’ll ask about our leader’s power?’ Langduhua preempted.

"Guanyu chuckled, his hostility toward her diminished. Compared to Lang Tianhua, she seemed almost benign.

“‘Our leader, Lang Tianhao, is a genuine peak-level Magister!’

"Pride shimmered in Langduhua’s eyes as she spoke.

“‘Peak-level Magister?’ Now Guanyu understood their boldness. Matching the精灵族族长 Allen’s strength explained their confidence.

“‘Well? Feeling frightened?’ she taunted.

“‘Expected, but manageable,’ Guanyu replied flatly.

"Langduhua bristled at his nonchalance. ‘If you’re scared, admit it! I despise dishonest cowards.’

“‘Say what you will. Don’t forget I have one question left.’

“‘Ask quickly! Stop dawdling!’

"Guanyu pondered. This final question must count. Suddenly, he hesitated: ‘Has your corps recently welcomed an精灵?’

“‘Wh-what精灵?’ Langduhua’s微表情 shifted—a telltale sign she knew something crucial.

“‘Pretending ignorance?’

"Under relentless questioning, she cracked. ‘Fine! I’ll tell you! That elf named Locke fled your clan. Whatever your corps’ motives for sheltering him, know this—he’s untrustworthy. Allying with him will bring ruin.’

"Langduhua gaped. ‘You knew all along! But why meddle in elf-mercenary affairs?’

“‘Need you care? My quarrel isn’t with your corps, but your alliance with Locke against me. You force my hand—I’ll fight to protect what’s mine!’

"Langduhua fell silent, recognizing his sincerity. Her corps faced peril; she must warn them about Locke immediately!

“‘Yearning to return?’ Guanyu read her desperation. ‘Beg, and I might release you.’

“‘I’d die before begging you, scoundrel!’

"The insult reignited Guanyu’s fury over past humiliations. ‘Devil woman! Rot here then! I’ll witness how Locke destroys your corps!’

"Langduhua’s eyes welled unexpectedly. She longed to return but couldn’t stomach Guanyu’s mockery. Had he asked civilly, she’d have complied.

"Suddenly, Aimi entered. ‘Brother Dragon, please release Sister Wolf!’

“‘Aimi? How long have you been there?’

“‘Like you earlier—I listened from the door. Brother Dragon, please release her!’

“‘Aimi, this isn’t about willingness. I can’t let her go.’

“‘Why? Are you afraid?’

"The words pierced Guanyu. Thankfully, he viewed Aimi as a child—else he’d have walked away. Still, the accusation stung. He couldn’t explain Locke’s plot without risking her rushing home, delaying her cure. To him, her safety mattered as much as her clan’s survival.

"As he agonized, Langduhua interjected: ‘Foolish girl! Stop speaking!’

“‘But I’m helping you!’ Aimi cried, bewildered.

“‘Your ‘help’ wounds another—one who loves you deeply!’

"The bold declaration left both speechless. Unable to bear more, Guanyu stormed out, leaping onto the roof.

"Sunset’s glow warmed his face as he gazed at the quiet streets below, thoughts drifting to distant family.

“‘Boss, feeling defeated?’ Bikamao appeared beside him.

"Guanyu remained silent.

“‘Every world has schemers and deceivers. Makes life interesting, no?’

“‘True… but being misunderstood aches. Sometimes I envy your carefree feline existence.’

“‘Swap places, and you’d chafe under my orders!’ Bikamao chuckled nervously as Guanyu glared. ‘See? One remark angers you!’

“‘Perhaps I’ve been too harsh,’ Guanyu conceded, recognizing his own strictness.

"Emboldened, Bikamao asked, ‘Why not explain yourself to Aimi?’

“‘Explaining would reveal Locke’s presence. She’d beg me to spare him, jeopardizing her cure.’

"Bikamao nodded gravely. ‘Wise as always, Boss.’

“‘Enough flattery. I need solutions, not praise.’"
