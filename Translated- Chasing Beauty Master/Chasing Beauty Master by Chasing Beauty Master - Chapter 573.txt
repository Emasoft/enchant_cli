“Boss, this man’s behavior is strange. We should leave this place immediately!” Another young man rushed to the middle-aged man’s side and whispered into his ear.

The middle-aged man’s expression darkened. Part of him truly feared Guan Yu’s power. The sheer force displayed in that single, brutal strike revealed immense internal energy—far surpassing any master he had ever encountered.

After a moment of contemplation, the middle-aged man abruptly shifted his demeanor. With a smile, he strode toward Guan Yu.

“Young Hero, this was all a misunderstanding! We were blind to Mount Tai’s majesty and failed to recognize you as the true transcendent master!”

Though Guan Yu’s intellect lagged behind an adult’s, he understood their sudden deference stemmed from fear. He waved dismissively. “Since you’ve admitted your mistake, I’ll forgive you. But if you dare insult me again, don’t expect mercy!”

The middle-aged man’s face twitched briefly before he composed himself. Turning to the flung dwarf, he barked, “Murphy! Get over here and apologize to this Young Hero!”

Murphy’s heart churned with frustration. He had hoped to reclaim dignity and impress his boss, only to collide with Guan Yu’s overwhelming strength. Had he known earlier, he’d sooner die than provoke such a foe. Now, not only did he endure a palm strike, but he also had to grovel. What if Guan Yu snapped and ended him?

As Murphy agonized, the middle-aged man roared, “You brat, are you coming or not? Since when do you dare disobey my orders?”

Crushed by pressure, Murphy shuffled toward Guan Yu, his nerves frayed by lingering trauma from the earlier attack.

“Y-Young Hero…I was wrong to lay hands on you. My wretched fingers deserve punishment. I deserve death…but even so, I beg your magnanimity…please spare my life…”

Guan Yu found the cowering spectacle amusing. How peculiar humans were—mocking and bullying until power silenced them. Though their sycophancy disgusted him, it starkly illustrated this continent’s brutal truth: strength dictated respect.

“Enough. Though detestable, I’ve no wish to kill you. Rise.”

Murphy kowtowed fervently, thudding to the ground. “Thank you, Young Hero, for sparing this unworthy life!”

Every gesture now flowed from genuine terror. Murphy knew his “boss” couldn’t have stopped Guan Yu’s killing blow. That mercy alone inspired awe.

From this moment, Murphy resolved to follow Guan Yu—if the latter would accept him.

The middle-aged man approached, glaring at Murphy until he scuttled aside. “Hahaha! Truly, Young Hero, your nobility shines! To forgive even your insulters—my cultivation pales before yours.”

Guan Yu sensed the man’s insincerity. Coldly, he retorted, “Flattery ill suits you. I’m but a youth of twenty. How could my cultivation rival yours?”

“Ah, modesty! Have you not heard ‘heroes emerge young’? The new wave surpasses the old! Our meeting here is fate’s design. Tell me—were your earlier words in jest?”

“Which words?”

“When we first spoke, you claimed not to know your name. Surely that was false?”

Guan Yu paused. “I truly can’t recall…but I’ll remember soon.”

In truth, Guan Yu considered revealing his transmigration from another world. Yet divulging secrets to such men offered no advantage—it would only breed misunderstanding.

“Very well. If you withhold your name, I shan’t pry. But I’ll share mine: Harris, Black Deacon of the Blood Fiend Sect. These are my subordinates.”

“Blood Fiend Sect? Never heard of it.” Guan Yu shook his head.

Days prior, such contempt would have earned a beating. Now, cowed by his power, they swallowed their pride. On this continent, strength alone commanded voice.

Harris chuckled awkwardly. “Ahem…our sect is humble. Your vast experience explains your ignorance. Still, I boldly entreat you to join us!”

Only then did the underlings grasp Harris’s fawning—he sought to recruit Guan Yu.

Guan Yu smirked at Harris’s offer, well aware his strength motivated the invitation. Though reluctant to join, he reasoned that aligning with them could aid his navigation of this unfamiliar land.

After feigning deliberation, Guan Yu declared, “I’ll join on one condition.”

Harris tensed. “What condition?”

“Fear not—it’s simple. Given our…rocky start, I require assurance of mutual safety. Otherwise, I won’t go.”

“Reasonable. State your terms.”

“I’ll accompany you but won’t formally join your sect. I’ll assist if needed, but come and go as I please. None shall command me.”

The demands were blunt yet fair. Harris hesitated, then forced a smile. “Agreed. As newcomers here, we’ll extend hospitality. Should you wish to join, our sect master would rejoice. If not—we’ll part amiably.”

“Boss, are we really taking him back?” a subordinate whispered.

Ignoring him, Harris glanced skyward. “Night approaches. We must hasten.” He turned to the others. “Stay sharp! Slackers will regret it!”

After berating his men, Harris addressed Guan Yu. “Young Hero, let’s depart. Delays invite danger.”

Nodding, Guan Yu followed. The terrain resembled the Elf Forest, but his fragmented memory retained nothing of that place.

An hour into their trek, dusk deepened. Guan Yu suddenly raised a hand. “Halt!”

The group froze, keeping distance as they warily watched him.

“Young Hero, what’s wrong?” Harris approached.

Guan Yu pointed wordlessly to a thicket.

Harris squinted—then a thunderous roar erupted as a colossal python surged from the foliage.

“Scatter!” Harris drew his blade while shouting.

Guan Yu assessed the beast—a Profound Rank magical beast, formidable in appearance but manageable. Yet caution ruled; unfamiliar with local toxins and untrustworthy companions, he couldn’t risk injury.

The underlings stared at Guan Yu with newfound awe. His warning had spared them a grisly fate.

“Black Deacon, what now?” a pale-faced subordinate quavered.

Harris eyed the python, tempted to test Guan Yu’s mettle. “Young Hero, can you handle this beast?”

Guan Yu remained silent, refusing to enable their dependency.

When Guan Yu didn’t respond, Harris turned. “If the Young Hero won’t act, we retreat. We’ll never reach base by nightfall.”

“Let me try!”

All turned to Murphy, whose unexpected courage drew scornful laughter.

Guan Yu felt an odd sympathy for the dwarf. Previously scheming and timid, Murphy now displayed uncharacteristic resolve.

“Wait!” Guan Yu interjected as Harris prepared another rebuke.

“Young Hero? Will you slay the python?”

Guan Yu nodded, pointing at Murphy. “Him. He fights with me.”

“What? That weakling? He’ll die!”

“Potential lies dormant until tested,” Guan Yu countered, approaching Murphy. “Well?”

Murphy swallowed. “G-Great Hero…I’ll fight!”

Though the others sneered, Guan Yu’s authority silenced protest.

The python, a local terror accustomed to devouring travelers, salivated at the prospect of fresh prey.

“Great Hero, distract it while I circle behind to stab its heart,” Murphy proposed.

Guan Yu laughed. “Why not pierce its skull?”

“Snakes demand heart strikes—their ‘seven inches.’ Even a severed head can retaliate.”

“Then why not face it head-on?”

Murphy grimaced. “Alone, I’d be swallowed whole. Unless…”

“Unless?”

“Unless one attains Intermediate Mage rank.”

Guan Yu blinked. If Intermediate Mage seemed unattainable here, his own Magus status must appear godlike.
