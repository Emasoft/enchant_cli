Though Guan Yu had teased Sun Xiaoya earlier about staying at her place—and the two were no strangers to sharing a bed—he now found himself hesitating.

At that moment, Sun Xiaoya’s bedroom door creaked open as she slipped out quietly. Having heard Guan Yu exit her mother’s room after completing the treatment, she had waited for him to come to hers. When no sound followed, she assumed he had left and ventured out to investigate.

Finding him standing motionless in the living room, she approached softly. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”

Guan Yu pulled her into his arms, cradling her chin with his left hand. Gazing at her flawless face, a sudden impulse surged within him. He leaned down and captured her lips.

Caught off guard, Sun Xiaoya let out muffled protests, pushing him away. Thinking she was upset, Guan Yu began to loosen his hold, but she whispered shyly, “Here… you’ll wake Mom. Let’s go back to my room.”

Though still wary of how she might react to his relationships with Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan, her words shattered his restraint. Sweeping her into his arms, he carried her to her bedroom.

Soon, obscure sounds emanated from the inner chamber, the air thick with passion, petals scattered across the floor.

Much later, Sun Xiaoya curled like a kitten against Guan Yu’s chest, tracing circles on his skin as he gently stroked her hair. Their synchronized breaths filled the silence until she finally spoke: “If you leave Y City this time… will you ever come back?”

Her greatest fear loomed—her mother’s incomplete recovery still required his care, and as a Mingyang High teacher, her life would inevitably drift apart from his if he took over Huanyu Group with Du Xiaojuan.

“The gate barred for twenty years opens at last for you.” Having guarded her heart her entire life, she now understood her mother’s decades-long devotion. For the first time, Sun Xiaoya believed in a love worth dying for—a love that made life’s hardships trivial once you found the one destined for you.

Yet she knew a man like Guan Yu could never belong solely to her. Beyond Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan, his power and ambitions destined him for greater responsibilities. As arguably the strongest individual in China—perhaps the world—he bore the weight of quelling threats like the restless Eastern Islands.

Reading her thoughts, Guan Yu kissed her lips lightly. “Miss me already? Should I take you to the capital?”

Pouting, she playfully punched his shoulder. “I’m serious! Stop joking.”

“So am I.” He nibbled her earlobe. “You, Shilei-jie—all of you should come. Y City isn’t safe with so many mutants here, even the Ouyang family’s in crisis. Once enemies learn I’m back, they’ll target you. After twenty years in the Demon Realm, I realized—what’s power without protecting those you love? I won’t abandon you again.”

Sun Xiaoya echoed softly, “Stay together forever… But when decades pass and we grow old while you remain young—”

Understanding her fear—the same reservation Liu Shilei once held—Guan Yu channeled spiritual energy into her, imparting time-reversal techniques. Guided by him, she began cultivating the miraculous art.

Next morning, Mrs. Sun had breakfast ready. Pulling her daughter aside, she chided, “Took you two long enough! If I hadn’t pushed you, who knows when you’d have given me grandchildren? Now in nine months—”

Blushing furiously, Sun Xiaoya cut in, “Mom! You’re supposed to protect me, not cheer this on!”

At breakfast, Guan Yu announced his imminent departure for the capital. The old woman nodded. “Go, as long as you’re happy.”

After arranging for Hou Jinshun and Mu Yun to join him later, Guan Yu set off.

**Chapter 1695: Pursuing the Peak**

Huanyu Group—a top-ten Chinese conglomerate spanning industries with trillions in assets—occupied a 38-story skyscraper on Chaoyang Avenue. Its towering sign proclaimed “Huanyu Tower.”

On approaching, Guan Yu asked Du Xiaojuan to stop the car, wanting to assess his empire incognito. Bodyguards trailing them found the youth peculiar but unsuspicious.

As Guan Yu walked toward the building, Liu Shilei watched his retreating figure with the same adoration as their first meeting twenty years prior. Du Xiaojuan teased, “Still not tired of staring?”

“I’ll never tire,” Liu Shilei retorted, groping Du’s chest. “You?”

“After twenty years of near-despair?” Du smiled. “I’d accepted never seeing him again. Now that he’s back, I’ll hand him Huanyu Group. Even if he leaves again for the Demon Realm to chase greater heights… no regrets.”

Liu Shilei leaned closer. “Why not join him there? From his tales, the Demon Realm has its own wonders.”

Entering the lobby, Guan Yu was intercepted by a statuesque receptionist. “Welcome to Huanyu Group. How may I assist you?”

“Uh… job hunting?”

“Excellent. May I know your qualifications and desired position?”

Caught off guard, Guan Yu mumbled, “Maybe I’ll just look around first.”

The woman’s smile remained but her tone hardened. “Tours require ID registration with Security. Let me escort you.”

As Guan Yu balked at the bureaucracy, a authoritative yet gentle voice intervened: “He’s with me.”

Recognizing CEO Du Xiaojuan, the receptionist retreated. Guan Yu sensed formidable energy withdrawing—a second-class mutant guard.

“A female second-class mutant as doorkeeper? Extravagant,” he remarked in the elevator.

Du Xiaojuan smiled. “Safety first. She screens everyone entering.”

Though Xue Yingfeng had claimed most mutants were middle-aged males, this guard appeared under thirty. Du explained: “Many undergo unauthorized experiments. She’s Malaysian—recruited privately.”

Touring departments, employees rose respectfully for Du. Whispers spread about the youth beside her—could this be the legendary Chairman Guan Yu from company documents?

By afternoon, Du confirmed via broadcast: Chairman Guan Yu had returned, granting all employees a month’s bonus.

That night, nations learned of Guan Yu’s return. Meanwhile, in the forest of his reappearance, two figures slaughtered hundreds of guards before vanishing.

**Chapter 1696: The Robot Secretary**

Overnight, Guan Yu transformed from a Mingyang High freshman to chairman of a trillion-dollar empire. Whether intentional or not, Du’s media leak resulted in prime-time coverage glorifying him as a national hero.

In a western Beijing villa, Guan Yu gaped at his televised portrait. “Who’s this paragon?”

“Stop preening,” Liu Shilei chided as Du Xiaojuan wheeled in a clothing rack. “Your new wardrobe—custom-tailored. Worth over $100k retail.”

Guan Yu groaned at the navy suit. “Must I?”

“Image matters, Chairman.” Du began undressing him, biting his chest until he flipped her onto the couch. Liu Shilei soon joined the tussle.

Next morning, a suited Guan Yu was paraded through Huanyu Tower like a zoo exhibit. “This isn’t work—it’s torture!” he hissed between forced smiles.

“You’ll adapt,” Du retorted. “I endured this for years.”

Reaching his office, a chirpy voice greeted: “Chairman, I’m your secretary Huang Yating.”

Trapped in his outer office, Guan Yu faced a crash course in corporate leadership as Du left for meetings. Alone with Huang, the real challenge began.
