First attacked by bees, then obstructed by flies—had this not been the 21st century, everyone would have believed divine beings truly existed.

This bizarre incident became a topic of endless fascination in the class long after the exams concluded. Outsiders dismissed it as hearsay, but eyewitness classmates vividly dubbed Liu Gang the “Enemy of All Animals.”

They even dramatized the event as “The Avengers alliance formed by Bumblebee and the Hulk to battle aliens.”

Of course, the story did not end there.

Guan Yu’s ingenious scheme would have been a waste of energy if it failed to leave an indelible mark on his classmates.

Liu Gang lay exhausted on the floor. After being tormented repeatedly, how could he not be spent? With two minutes left until the exam’s end, merely standing up would take a minute. What could he accomplish in the remaining sixty seconds? By then, all answers would have been copied.

Resentment simmered, but what could he do? He had no evidence against Guan Yu.

Staring at the ceiling’s surveillance camera, he prayed the device had recorded everything.

During the math exam, an informant had insisted Guan Yu cheated flagrantly. Puzzled by the camera’s silence, Liu Gang concluded it must have broken from disuse.

To prevent future failures, he personally funded new cameras and ensured their meticulous calibration. Now, all his hopes rested on those three lenses.

A foul stench jolted him from his thoughts. His eyes widened in horror.

After gritting his teeth during his final “sprint,” his mouth hung open—a fatal mistake. Three flies seized the moment, darting into his throat with lightning speed.

Instantly, Liu Gang gagged on the revolting odor.

People often insult others by saying their breath “smells like excrement.” But who has actually tasted feces to know its true stench? Unless mentally unwell, no one would volunteer for such an experiment.

Yet on this day, Liu Gang, N University’s deputy dean of academics, became history’s first connoisseur of this unique flavor.

The stench rejuvenated him by thirty years. He sprang up in a carp kip-up—had his physique been trimmer and features handsomer, the class might have applauded.

Instead, consumed by mortal shame, Liu Gang abandoned his invigilation duties and bolted from the classroom, desperate for water.

Students exchanged baffled glances. Why would he flee before the exam ended? Had he finally cracked?

Few witnessed the flies’ ingress. Those who did wore expressions ranging from astonishment to horror. Male onlookers gaped in perverse amusement, while female witnesses turned pale, stomachs churning.

Guan Yu, seated far from Liu Gang, missed the spectacle but easily imagined the aftermath.

This wasn’t his first cruel stratagem—his interrogation of Qian Tong had been far more brutal. Though he later deemed such methods excessive, today’s prank merely left flies lingering in Liu Gang’s mouth, undetected.

His motive was clear: Liu Gang’s relentless harassment of their class, aided by insiders, demanded an unforgettable lesson. After today’s humiliation, rumors would destroy Liu Gang’s reputation, forcing him to tread carefully.

“Careful” proved an understatement. Later, Liu Gang voluntarily transferred to another institution.

After expelling the dead flies, Liu Gang vomited bile, underwent emergency stomach pumping, and emerged gaunt and broken. Finally, he grasped these students’ formidable ingenuity—outnumbered and outsmarted, retreat became his only option.

Chapter 579: The Most Legendary Score in History

Zhu Lin had tampered with the classroom cameras. Finding no evidence and lacking the will to fight unbelievable claims, Liu Gang gladly accepted reassignment.

With Liu Gang gone and exams concluded, everyone celebrated.

Their joy might have been tempered had the other invigilator not been Liu Shilei. That evening, the class partied wildly to honor their heroes. Initially reluctant to join youthful revelry, Liu Shilei succumbed to Guan Yu’s persistent coaxing.

By dinner’s end, male students lay strewn across the venue—retrieved by friends, girlfriends, or supportive classmates. Guan Yu knew exactly where he’d be taken, escorted not by peers but by Liu Shilei herself.

As the prime target of collective toasts, even his healing abilities couldn’t ward off intoxication. The late hour and his earlier lip-reading promise to Liu Shilei created perfect conditions for… developments.

They checked into a presidential suite, commencing primitive “plowing and weaving.”

The semester’s remainder consisted of monthly exams. Post-English exam, Guan Yu resumed his routine until a jarring call interrupted four days later.

“Boss, come to school! Big news!” Wang Zhen’s excited voice crackled through the phone.

“After I wake up,” Guan Yu mumbled, hanging up. Last night’s “battles” with Wenqing left him exhausted. As he often joked: “Even the strongest ox tires when fields multiply.”

He slept till afternoon. Finding Wenqing gone, he remembered Wang Zhen’s call and drove to campus.

At a nearby restaurant, he devoured food before Wang Zhen arrived with Tian Hao and Zhu Lin. Noting Guan Yu’s ravenousness and Zhao Jing’er’s comment about his “exhaustion,” Wang Zhen smirked: “Boss, I’ll bring you some hometown specialties—ox whip, tiger whip. Super effective!”

Guan Yu spat out his rice. “Get lost! I’m young—don’t need that crap!” Then casually added: “But if you’ve got extras, bring ’em.”

The trio roared with laughter.

After jokes subsided, Wang Zhen revealed: “English scores are out. Our class averages over 90!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Just grades. Why the fuss?”

“This time’s different!” Wang Zhen glowed. Leading a cheating ring that humiliated a dean while securing perfect scores—undetected—filled him with pride.

“Don’t celebrate yet,” Guan Yu cautioned. “More exams coming. Plan carefully.”

“No worries!” Wang Zhen waved. “Without Liu Gang, regular cheating’s easy.”

“He’s not invigilating? Strange. Stay alert—he might scheme behind…”

“Boss, you’re behind! Liu Gang transferred out! No more tricks!”

“Transferred?” Guan Yu feigned surprise, though privately satisfied.

“Probably scared of us!” Tian Hao chuckled.

Their laughter echoed memories of the elaborate plot.

“There’s one weird thing,” Wang Zhen frowned. “Fu Lili scored five points.”

In this legendary class emerged history’s most legendary failure. While others soared, she alone plummeted—five points, when random guesses should yield higher.

“Boss, isn’t that strange?”

“Not at all.” Guan Yu smiled knowingly. “I gave her that score.”

Shocked silence followed.

“You mean… she’s the snitch?” Wang Zhen gasped.

“Exactly.”

“How’d you know?”

“A master’s secrets.” Guan Yu smirked before explaining: “My ‘distracted’ pre-exam behavior was observing subtle cues. Noticed her exchanging looks with Liu Gang. Fed her wrong answers as punishment.”

The truth involved mind-reading Liu Gang during exams, but Guan Yu credited psychological insight. His friends marveled at his cunning, unaware of his supernatural edge.

Though impressed, they mock-scowled at his ruthlessness.

Chapter 580: Departure

The lone low score stood out starkly. When questioned, Fu Lili insisted she’d copied answers correctly. The mystery confounded all—except Guan Yu, who’d orchestrated her downfall.

His private investigation (via Liu Gang’s memories) revealed her betrayal. By leaking the cheating method, she’d forced Liu Gang into the open, allowing Guan Yu to plant false evidence.

While his friends praised his psychological acuity, Guan Yu chuckled inwardly. Some secrets were best kept—even from allies.
