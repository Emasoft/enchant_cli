“You must understand, if Guan Yu truly becomes a dual cultivator of magic and martial arts in the future, the glory of the Cloud Azure Sect will far surpass its current state. Even if he doesn’t achieve that path, his extraordinary aptitude and astonishing speed in mastering spells will undoubtedly make him a formidable mage. Thus, Xuanming has decided to prioritize his training.”

The dawn had broken as Guan Yu stretched lazily and stepped outside. “Looks like fine weather today.”

Second to Wolf followed, chuckling. “You might be the idlest person in the Cloud Azure Sect today. Everyone else is either cheering for friends or preparing nervously for their matches. Thanks to you defeating your opponent last night, you’ve got nothing to do.”

“Hah! The fool brought it upon himself. I hadn’t even realized he was my assigned rival. I ought to thank whoever arranged the match list,” Guan Yu replied with a grin.

“What a coincidence,” Second to Wolf said skeptically. “Did you already know A’Cai was your opponent? Is that why you provoked him into a fight? You went too far—if this had happened during the official match, you’d have violated the rules against excessive force. Even I don’t buy this ‘coincidence.’ It reeks of staged drama.”

Chapter 3,272: Scram!

“Such a perfect coincidence—beating your own rival to a pulp? Claiming ignorance? Even I don’t believe that,” Second to Wolf scoffed.

“I truly didn’t know! The board didn’t show my name, so I meant to check the other side. But Wen Ming and A’Cai blocked me, and things escalated,” Guan Yu explained, still amused.

“That makes it even stranger,” Second to Wolf pressed. “Why didn’t you clash with Wen Ming after Xiao Zhi insulted him? Instead, you fought A’Cai?”

“Wen Ming may be arrogant, but he’s slow-witted and inarticulate. A’Cai kept egging me on, so we traded blows. Besides,” Guan Yu added slyly, “if I’d injured Wen Ming too, wouldn’t Xiao Zhi also be free today?”

“How considerate! Should the world revolve around you? Are you the sun?” Second to Wolf rolled his eyes. “By crippling A’Cai, you’ve left yourself unchallenged. Had you taken down Wen Ming, Xiao Zhi would’ve been idle too. Then the sect would’ve paired you two for a match. Would that have pleased you?”

Guan Yu smacked his forehead. “Right! Thank the heavens I held back. If more Left Void Peak disciples were injured, I’d have an opponent today. You’ve a sharp mind, Second Brother!”

“Bah! Even a toe could figure that out. Don’t pretend you didn’t know,” Second to Wolf retorted.

“I swear I didn’t! I use my brain, unlike your toe-based calculations,” Guan Yu teased, tapping his temple. “What toes grasp, brains overlook.”

“Scram! Shouldn’t you be cheering for Xiao Zhi? His match starts early. Don’t be late and offend him.”

“Aren’t you coming?”

“No interest in watching these delicate sparring matches. I’d rather nap.” With a dismissive wave, Second to Wolf retreated indoors.

Alone, Guan Yu headed to the Central Summit arena where Xiao Zhi would face Wen Ming. Along the way, disciples scurried about—needlessly frantic, in his opinion. Hosting the Six Peaks Tournament had consumed the sect for weeks, yet preparations dragged on.

Passing Tiger Head Peak’s hall, Guan Yu noted the six Peak Masters inside, debating the sect’s future. “Old folks planning decades ahead at every tournament,” he mused. “Not my concern. I’m just a junior disciple here to cultivate. Best they leave me be.”

Recalling Xuanming’s warning about overreliance on the Imperial Seal, Guan Yu withdrew the artifact. Though it stored spells for instant casting, dependency risked stunting his growth. True mastery required precise incantations and spiritual focus. Yet, he admitted, “This seal’s my lifeline. Without it, I’d feel naked. At least Second Brother doesn’t have to babysit me now.”

The central plaza, vast and irregularly circular, hosted each peak’s arena beneath their respective banners. At the Central Summit’s bustling grounds, Guan Yu spotted mixed crowds—Left Void Peak’s disciples, identifiable by black sashes, mingled with the host faction.

A’Ze hurried over. “Guan Yu! Xiao Zhi knew you’d come. Let me escort you.”

“Of course! Our brother’s victory demands witness,” Guan Yu declared loudly, drawing wary glances from Left Void disciples. Their Peak Master’s order to avoid conflict had turned Guan Yu into a pariah they skirted widely.

As A’Ze led him trackside, Guan Yu noted the wooden platform—a modest hundred-square-meter stage where falling meant defeat. “Why’s Left Void here in force? Don’t they know they’re doomed?”

“Wen Ming’s their last hope. If he loses, their tournament ends today,” A’Ze explained.

Peak Master Zheng approached warmly. “Xiao Zhi’s fortunate to have your support.”

“The honor’s mine. His candor makes him a rare friend,” Guan Yu replied courteously.

A gong announced the match. Xiao Zhi ascended holding a massive leg bone—his enchanted weapon—while Wen Ming brandished a standard Cloud Azure Sword.

“That bone’s gloriously savage! You’ll crush him!” Guan Yu cheered.

Xiao Zhi grinned back. “Just watch!”

As the duel commenced, Wen Ming ignored etiquette, immediately chanting spells. Boos erupted when his energy beam clashed with Xiao Zhi’s aqua surge from the bone. The stalemate revealed their equal power but differing stamina. Beads of sweat formed on Wen Ming’s brow while Xiao Zhi remained composed.

“Finish him, Xiao Zhi!” A’Ze shouted.

“Had I known he’d tire so fast, I’d have ended this sooner!” Xiao Zhi taunted.

Left Void disciples jeered about his reliance on the bone. “Without daddy’s toy, you’d be nothing!”

Central Summit supporters fired back: “Keep barking! Your defeat’s inevitable!”

As Wen Ming faltered, Guan Yu smirked. Victory was certain. The real spectacle lay ahead.
