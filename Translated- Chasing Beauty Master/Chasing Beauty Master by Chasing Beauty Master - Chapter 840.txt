“Who helped you capture my friends?” Guan Yu demanded. He knew that Ma He, being new to the area, couldn’t have fully investigated even Guan Yu’s own affairs, let alone identified his two closest companions here. Even if Ma He had somehow learned of them, approaching them would have been difficult without external aid. Someone must have assisted him from the shadows.

“I have no obligation to tell you that.” Ma He’s Mandarin was indeed poor, making his words laborious for Guan Yu to decipher. Still, Guan Yu had a suspicion: the Feng family. In this region, aside from the Fengs—his sworn rivals—no one else would have motive to target him.

“Did Young Master Feng neglect to teach you manners?” Guan Yu retorted dismissively. He trusted Ma He’s claim that Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo weren’t here.

Yet without knowing their whereabouts, Guan Yu couldn’t act recklessly. He had sensed Qiong Si’s presence but refrained from engaging. Even if they subdued Ma He together, rescuing Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo would remain impossible. The Fengs might then use the hostages as leverage, complicating matters further.

*If the Fengs have made their move,* Guan Yu thought coldly, *I’ll play their game. But targeting my friends? They’ll regret this.*

“You came here seeking vengeance for Ma Hai,” Guan Yu said aloud. “Why involve innocents? This matter has nothing to do with my friends. Young Master Feng kidnapped them merely to lure me here. Now that I’ve arrived, why not release them?”

Ma He hesitated, visibly startled that Guan Yu had deduced the Feng family’s involvement. After a moment’s pause, he retrieved his phone.

“Guan Yu is here. Release the two now,” Ma He instructed the caller. Guan Yu noted that Ma He didn’t seem unreasonable—even somewhat principled. A true villain wouldn’t have made that call; he’d have attacked outright.

On the other end, Young Master Feng scoffed. “Since Guan Yu’s there, just kill him. Weren’t you confident? Those two captives are worthless mutts anyway.”

Ma He’s brow twitched. “Guan Yu refuses to fight unless his friends are freed. If he flees, I cannot stop him.” His words, though clumsily articulated, carried steel.

Young Master Feng laughed. “Oh? The mighty Ma He, daunted? I set traps to aid you, yet you hesitate. Pathetic.” He had no intention of releasing the hostages. Even if Ma He succeeded, the Fengs would still owe debts for his services.

*Not a trivial sum,* Young Master Feng mused. *But with two hostages, we’ll extort the Wei family. Their only heir is worth a fortune.* Profit, not vengeance, drove him. Releasing them now was unthinkable.

“Free them, and Guan Yu will engage me,” Ma He insisted, his tone hardening. “Do not interfere.”

Reluctant to alienate Ma He—a potent ally or dangerous foe—Young Master Feng feigned compliance. “Very well. I’ll release them. Inform Guan Yu.” He hung up, lying through his teeth.

**Chapter 2151: Two Against One**

Young Master Feng had no intention of freeing the captives. If Ma He failed to kill Guan Yu tonight, the Fengs would face retribution. Success was imperative.

Seated at an aged wooden desk, he retrieved an automatic pistol from its drawer, tucked it into his waistband, and departed. He would observe the confrontation and shoot Guan Yu if necessary.

Meanwhile, Ma He declared to Guan Yu, “He agreed to release them. Prepare to die.” He lunged forward, only to halt at Guan Yu’s roar: “Wait!”

“What now?” Ma He growled.

“Young Master Feng is untrustworthy. I won’t fight until I see my friends. Force my hand, and I’ll flee.”

*Damn him!* Ma He cursed inwardly, recognizing the stall tactic. Ignoring further objections, he flashed toward Guan Yu, and the clash began.

Qiong Si, witnessing this, leapt into the fray without hesitation. Her cultivation was formidable. Alone, Guan Yu had avoided direct confrontation with Ma He’s overwhelming strength, but with Qiong Si, the tide shifted.

Ma He staggered under their coordinated assault. “Treacherous!” he spat, blocking a hook punch. “You brought aid!”

“Treachery?” Guan Yu countered, striking again. “Abducting innocents to ambush me? Your hypocrisy astounds.”

Ma He, now purely defensive, realized the woman’s prowess matched Guan Yu’s. Survival, not victory, became his priority. *As the saying goes: ‘Retain the green hills, and firewood will never lack.’*

Yet their relentless assault denied him respite. Qiong Si’s blistering speed and their seamless teamwork—one high, one low—left no openings.

Forced into retreat, Ma He edged toward where Young Master Feng lurked. Unbeknownst to Guan Yu and Qiong Si, Feng crept closer, pistol in hand, drawn by the combat’s clamor.

Peering from behind a tree, Feng gaped at the scene: Ma He battered by Guan Yu and a dazzlingly skilled woman. *A shame to mar such beauty with bullet wounds,* he thought, training his shaky aim on Guan Yu.

The trio’s rapid movements foiled his targeting. Oblivious to the threat, Guan Yu and Qiong Si pressed their attack. Despite their combined efforts, Ma He’s first-class尊 cultivation kept him unscathed—not even his robes grazed.

Guan Yu fretted: subduing Ma He as a bargaining chip might fail if Feng disregarded his subordinate’s life.

**Chapter 2152: The Dilapidated Warehouse**

Unseen by Feng, Hou Jinshun and his men infiltrated the woods. Tracking the skirmish’s noise, they flanked Feng. Hou Jinshun, noting the pistol, crept closer—his cultivation masking his approach.

Ordering his team to wait, Hou Jinshun struck Feng’s nape. The young master crumpled, pistol clattering. Hou Jinshun caught it mid-fall.

The scuffle drew Guan Yu’s attention. “Search for Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo!” he shouted. “They’re held by Feng’s men!”

Hou Jinshun directed his team to fan out. Moments later, a scout reported a guarded derelict warehouse.

The crumbling structure, encircled by overgrown weeds, housed two vehicles: Feng’s luxury car and a black van. Inside, three guards lounged near wooden crates. Two figures, hooded and bound, lay nearby—Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo.

Hou Jinshun’s men scaled the rear wall, streaming live footage to his phone. Six enemies total.

“Pose as Feng’s men,” Hou Jinshun ordered. “Walk in boldly.”

As they approached, the guards’ raucous laughter echoed—a grating, shrill sound. With Feng absent, discipline had laxed.

Hou Jinshun’s team moved swiftly. Two scouts confirmed no traps or cameras. Peering through high windows, they verified the hostages.

“Surround the warehouse,” Hou Jinshun commanded. “Strike on my signal.”

The rescue unfolded—a calculated gamble against time and the Fengs’ ruthlessness.
