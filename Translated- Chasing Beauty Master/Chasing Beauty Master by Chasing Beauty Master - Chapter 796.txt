“Oh my, I don’t usually come to such expensive places unless someone else is treating, haha!” Pan Taisheng joked humorously.

Hou Jinshun immediately approached upon seeing the newcomers. “Guanyu, bringing a friend for drinks tonight?”

“Mm,” Guanyu responded softly before adding, “Big Mouth, fetch two bottles of good wine, some dried fruits, and a few plates of appetizers.”

Hou Jinshun didn’t mind the task, but the nickname “Big Mouth” left him baffled. He stared at Guanyu with a confused expression.

Noticing his dazed look, Guanyu explained, “You’re a blabbermouth. What exactly did you tell Qing Linger about me?”

Hou Jinshun scratched his head and chuckled sheepishly, finally understanding the origin of the nickname. “I just… mentioned some casual things about you during idle chats. Hehehe.” His awkward grin betrayed his awareness of having overshared.

Knowing words once spoken couldn’t be retracted, Guanyu refrained from harsh reproach. “If you wag that tongue of yours again without cause, I’ll sew your mouth shut. Now go get the wine!” he feigned anger.

“Right away! Please wait a moment,” Hou Jinshun hurried off.

“This place has excellent ambiance—even the waitresses are beauties. As your friend, I mustn’t let such resources go to waste. Since this is the Yang family’s establishment and you’re their son-in-law, you’ll have to bring me here often!” Pan Taisheng enthused after settling into his seat.

A devoted drinker who never missed alcohol with any meal, Pan typically indulged with his roughneck friends in modest eateries. High-end venues like this weren’t beyond his means, but he considered their inflated prices foolish—unless someone else footed the bill, as Guanyu did tonight.

Chapter 2019: A Troublesome Opponent

Though Pan owned a spacious apartment, his finances were strained by constant taxes and obligatory “gifts” to officials. His gambling habit—persistent losses both large and small—further hindered what could have been a more comfortable life. Guanyu knew this but avoided touching on sensitive topics, accepting Pan’s claim that he saved “to marry” at face value.

Their drinking session lasted until past eight. While Guanyu remained unaffected, Pan grew thoroughly intoxicated. “C’mon Guanyu! Another bottle each…” Pan slurred, his head lolling.

“Of course, let’s drink more,” Guanyu agreed while signaling Hou Jinshun to stop serving. He helped the inebriated Pan into his car, intending to drive him home.

As they turned a corner downtown, a massive truck—ordinarily banned from central areas—charged toward them at alarming speed. Guanyu executed a sharp U-turn, avoiding collision. The truck pursued, but Guanyu’s sports car outsped it. Diverting from Pan’s route, he raced toward the western outskirts.

Reaching a desolate construction zone, Guanyu parked covertly and stood waiting in the road. Moments later, the truck’s blinding lights appeared. As it roared toward him, Guanyu hurled a fist-sized stone at the driver’s presumed position before darting aside.

The projectile shattered the windshield. The truck swerved violently, screeching to a halt inches from a tree. Ten black-coated figures emerged from the cargo hold, charging Guanyu with preternatural speed—all cultivators of significant power.

Guanyu’s protective eggshell barrier shimmered as he engaged. Their coordinated phantom attacks—illusory duplicates indistinguishable in darkness—proved maddening. Each shattered clone regenerated instantly. When Guanyu detonated his shield to clear the swarm, he discovered none had been real bodies.

A raspy voice spoke behind him: “Your shield takes ten hours to reform. Correct?” A lone black-clad man materialized, features obscured. Before Guanyu could react, the stranger struck his left arm with dislocating force.

Countering with a concealed dagger, Guanyu pierced the attacker’s hand, sending him sprawling. The man retaliated by multiplying—two becoming four, then eight—until dozens surrounded Guanyu.

Chapter 2020: The Thorny Adversary

Streetlights abruptly died, plunging the area into gloom. “Damn it!” Guanyu cursed as the clones began coalescing energy. A compressed air projectile detonated against him, thinning his barrier dangerously.

Realizing conventional tactics failed, Guanyu snapped a sapling for a makeshift staff. Whirling through the clones, he disrupted their formation. When the leader lunged again, Guanyu feinted, embedding his dagger in the man’s shoulder.

The attacker staggered back, multiplying exponentially. Guanyu pressed his advantage, staff cracking through illusions. “If you want clones, I’ll bury you in splinters!” he growled, relentless.

Chapter 2021: A Body Full of Thorns

Blood dripped from the leader’s wounds as his clones wavered. Guanyu’s staff became a blur, each strike calculated to probe for substance. When the real body flinched, Guanyu pounced—only to impale another phantom.

The cycle continued until dawn’s first light revealed subtle differences in the clones’ movements. Seizing his chance, Guanyu vaulted over a feint and drove his staff through the true body’s chest. The clones dissolved like smoke.

Panting, Guanyu stared at the vanishing attacker. “Who sent you?” The dying man rasped a laugh, dissolving into shadow before answering.
