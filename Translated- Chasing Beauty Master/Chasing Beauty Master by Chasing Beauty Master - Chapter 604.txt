“Hearing Bika Mao’s words, Guan Yu immediately sat cross-legged, enduring excruciating pain as he began channeling another strand of thunder energy into his dantian. Seeing Guan Yu enter cultivation state, Bika Mao didn’t idle either. As if conjuring paper from thin air, he started sketching something with his miniature dragon claws. After a few strokes, he stored the paper and flew toward a distant rock.

Perching on the stone, Bika Mao closed his eyes facing Guan Yu’s direction. He merely needed to wait until the youth awakened from meditation.

Within half an hour, Guan Yu opened eyes now devoid of exhaustion, instead shining with renewed vigor. Sensing his completion, Bika Mao lazily lifted his eyelids. “Not bad,” the dragon-cat remarked as Guan Yu approached. “Faster than yesterday’s energy channeling.”

Scratching his head sheepishly, Guan Yu grinned. “All thanks to your superb guidance, Lord Bika Mao.”

“Flatterer!” Bika Mao chuckled. “Since when did you learn sweet-talking? Not that I mind!” His laughter carried an inexplicable pressure that unsettled Guan Yu. Producing the previously drawn list, Bika Mao tossed it over. “Herbs for magical concoctions. Go procure these from the market.”

Guan Yu’s heart sank catching the paper. Last purchase of mystical herbs had cost hundreds gold coins – funds only replenished by his father’s gift of a Second Order Thunder Devourer’s magic core. Unfolding the list, his legs gave way. The ingredients mirrored previous demands but now required specific growth periods: “Second Order Thunder Devourer core, three-year Demon Spirit Herb, two-year Celestial Mystery Herb...”

“Pathetic!” Bika Mao scoffed at Guan Yu’s dismay. “These are for your Xuan Thunder Body Tempering! Without my spiritual elixirs to neutralize accumulating thunder toxins, you’ll shed layers of skin! Consider yourself lucky I’m helping – most beg in vain for my aid!”

**Chapter 1532: Economic Crisis**

“It’s not about reluctance,” Guan Yu protested. “I’ve exhausted my funds! Father already advanced my entire allowance. If I request more, he’ll grow suspicious – endangering your secrecy!”

The youth’s feigned concern thinly veiled his plea for assistance. Bika Mao, being both Nine-Star Holy Dragon and master alchemist, pondered before relenting. “True enough. Had your father not defected from Wang Clan, resources would flow easier. Very well – fetch the Wood Wolf core you bought earlier, plus any Spirit-Nourishing Grass and Wood Spirit Vines. Those grow abundantly here.”

Relief washed over Guan Yu – these common herbs dotted their mountain peak. As he scurried to gather them, Bika Mao returned to his rock perch.

Soon, Guan Yu returned panting, arms overflowing with herbs. “Will these suffice?”

“Fool!” Bika Mao barked. “A single first-order Wood Wolf core only requires four each! You’ve plucked twenty! Though...” His tone softened. “I’ll adjust the formula. Wasted herbs shame any alchemist – remember this when you master the craft.”

After arranging materials, Bika Mao ordered Guan Yu back. With dragon-clawed flourish, blinding light engulfed the ingredients. A crackling cauldron materialized – its surface crawling with lightning.

“What’s that?!” Guan Yu gaped.

“An alchemist’s lifeline!” Bika Mao declared. “Superior cauldrons birth superior elixirs. Observe well!”

Meanwhile, Liu Chuntian desperately pounded an energy barrier, exhaustion mounting. As Guanyu prepared to leave, her plea stopped him: “Brother Guan Yu... could you open this?”

“Why should I?” he coldly responded.

Her resigned smile faltered as she resumed futile attacks. Soft-hearted Huo Lingling intervened: “Sister Chuntian needs help!”

Relenting, Guan Yu wordlessly approached. The crowd held breath as he shattered the barrier with casual kick.

“Thank you...” Liu murmured, but Guan Yu already walked away.

**Chapter 1533: Trash?**

Weeks later during sparring, Lingling noticed strange energy swirling around sleeping Guan Yu. Purple aura enveloped him as she instinctively channeled protective magic.

“Save your high-tier spells,” Guan Yu refused upon waking. “Let’s compete – I’ll use self-found scrolls against your Earth Tier manual. We’ll compare progress monthly.”

“But this Earth Tier...”

“Is beneath me,” he whispered. “True masters find their own paths.”

Witnessing their nonchalant treatment of premium scrolls as “trash”, surrounding disciples stared in speechless envy.
