Sakura let out another startled cry. In the air where they had just been standing now hovered a figure - a man dressed in monastic robes who appeared no older than his thirties, yet radiated an overwhelming aura of power.

Both parties immediately recognized each other. Guan Yu and the newly arrived man simultaneously exclaimed:
"Lord Guan Yu?"
"God of War Ito?"

Sakura never imagined that her simple request for Guan Yu to accompany her to view Mount Fuji's night scenery would attract the attention of the legendary God of War Ito before they even reached the mountain. She quietly remained by Guan Yu's side, rendered speechless.

Guan Yu's true purpose in accompanying Sakura to Mount Fuji tonight had been to confront Ito. The Divine Emperor had informed him that Ito cultivated atop this sacred peak, and as expected, the warrior hadn't shied away from appearing when summoned.

The moment Ito materialized, Guan Yu assessed his strength - peak Saint Realm. Though slightly inferior to his own Realm Sovereign level, the gap wasn't insurmountable.

While Guan Yu evaluated him, Ito stood frozen in shock. The God of War had experienced numerous fortuitous encounters within the Demon Tower, rising from an ordinary Earth martial artist to Saint Realm pinnacle within mere years. Having carved his name across the demonic realms, he'd returned to Earth believing himself invincible - until facing this Realm Sovereign cultivator before him.

Ito had warned the Divine Emperor about countless powerful entities in the demonic realms. While ostensibly advocating global cooperation against external threats, his true aim was to subsume all earthly factions under his control.

Confident in overwhelming Guan Yu through sheer might, Ito now stared in disbelief. Not only did this opponent surpass him, but the chasm between Saint and Sovereign Realms yawned vast indeed.

**Chapter 1738: Tacit Understanding**

Though reunited with Liu Shilei and others these past months, Guan Yu often felt inexplicable emptiness in solitude. His life seemed fragmented - yearning for earthly loves while trapped in the Demon Tower, yet nostalgic for those wandering demonic days now that he'd returned.

Sensing Ito's formidable aura, Guan Yu inhaled deeply. This confrontation rekindled the thrilling tension he'd missed since leaving the Tower.

Recovering his composure, Ito invited them to his cultivation site. Mount Fuji's snow-capped caldera gleamed under moonlight like a veiled maiden in white silk.

Following their host, Guan Yu and Sakura soared toward the volcanic peak. Sakura marveled at the scenery below while the two warriors remained unmoved by vistas they'd long transcended.

Landing in the icy crater, they found a crystalline ice-house glowing in the snow - Ito's sanctuary. The single-block structure, seamlessly carved through cultivation rather than construction, contained basic amenities. Surprisingly, a full tea set occupied one corner.

While Sakura preferred bitter coffee (Ito heated her drink through palm-fire before brewing tea with spiritual energy), Guan Yu noted the paradox - a fire-aligned cultivator choosing this frozen peak to temper his volatile energies.

The two men sipped jade-green tea in companionable silence, ancient comrades requiring no words. Sakura watched curiously through ice walls as moonlight danced on snowy slopes.

When cups emptied and coffee cooled, Guan Yu rose gracefully. "Our thanks for your hospitality." Taking Sakura's hand, he led her out without ceremony. The God of War remained seated, offering neither farewell nor challenge.

Puzzled but obedient, Sakura followed. "I thought he'd at least ask us to stay! I should've gotten his autograph - he's our national idol!"

Guan Yu chuckled. "Patience. Opportunities remain."

Suddenly, searing heat erupted behind them. Sakura screamed as volcanic fury seemed to explode - until Guan Yu's azure energy shield enveloped her, neutralizing the inferno.

A cataclysmic roar shook the mountain. Cradled in Guan Yu's arms, Sakura watched centuries-old ice geyser skyward, blizzards obscuring vision. "Hold tight," he murmured.

As the ice cocooned them in a protective dome, Sakura peeked through laced fingers. Though terrified, she nestled against Guan Yu's chest. "I don't mind if you beat up our national hero. Show him who's stronger!"

**Chapter 1739: Clash of Titans**

While Sakura remained blissfully unaware within the energy shield, Ito gaped in disbelief. Guan Yu had blocked his full-powered strike without counterattacking - not even a tremor!

Recovering, the God of War summoned a fiery dragon from his palms. The flaming serpent roared toward the ice prison, melting Guan Yu's defenses instantly.

Sakura shrieked at the descending inferno. "Volcanic eruption?!"

"Merely spiritual flames," Guan Yu soothed, conjuring a sapphire water-dragon thrice the fire beast's size. Their collision detonated like divine artillery, avalanches cascading as the mountain groaned.

Thrilled by his first real challenge since returning, Guan Yu infused Sakura with protective energy before launching skyward. "To the heavens! Else we level Fuji!"

Ito's fiery mount spiraled upward, Guan Yu's aqueous dragon close behind. Below, early-risers filmed the spectacle - crimson and azure leviathans dueling amidst swirling snow.

Young mutant warrior Hayakawa茂 watched from his villa, awestruck. "True power! I must apprentice under Lord Guan Yu!"

Panicked citizens flooded streets, some mistaking this for eruption, others prostrating before "divine dragons." But all witnessed history - two titans clashing where earth met sky.

**Chapter 1740: Elemental Opposition**

The fire dragon's radiance dwarfed its aqueous counterpart, painting night skies blood-red. Yet Guan Yu's creation held firm, icy maw clamping on flaming talons.

Ito had miscalculated. Intelligence suggested Guan Yu returned weakened - barely surpassing first-class mutants. Yesterday's duel with Hayakawa茂 seemed confirmation. The Divine Emperor's weapon return? Mere placation until Ito could subjugate this "inferior" opponent.

But reality proved crueler. Realm Sovereign versus Saint - an insurmountable gulf. Still, pride demanded this battle. For Earth's future leadership, for cultivation's pure thrill, their dragons entwined in apocalyptic ballet.

Citizens gaped as elemental fury illuminated the sacred mountain. Some saw omens, others awakening - but none would forget this night when gods walked among men.
