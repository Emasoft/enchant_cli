“But no one expected that Lin Qiaoqiao wouldn’t spare her father any face. ‘Why are you shouting? What’s all this fuss about?’ she snapped. ‘I’ve told you both before—I already have a boyfriend! You’re the ones who insisted on this blind date because the Fang family is rich and you want me to live comfortably. This whole mess is your doing—it has nothing to do with me!’”

“Her words left everyone stunned, each processing the outburst differently. Guan Yu, too, was taken aback. He hadn’t imagined her temper could flare so fiercely, outright dismissing her parents’ authority.”

“Lin Zhiyu had hoped his daughter would at least save him some dignity in front of outsiders. Instead, she’d stripped him bare. The only calm person in the room was Fang Su.”

“Fang Su had met Lin Qiaoqiao at a party and had been instantly captivated by her looks. Her fiery personality only deepened his infatuation. Now, he secretly rejoiced, determined to win her over. Her defiance excited him—it had ‘flavor.’”

“The more Fang Su stared at Qiaoqiao, the more entranced he became. Sensing the awkward tension, he stood with a placating smile. ‘Don’t be angry, Qiaoqiao. This isn’t entirely your father’s fault. I’m the one who fell for you first and asked him to arrange this dinner.’”

“‘Who the hell do you think you are?’ Qiaoqiao barked, her contempt slicing through the room. ‘Since when do you get to decide anything about me?’”

“Even Lin Zhiyu held no sway over her normally. Wang Jie, the family’s true authority, now interjected with restrained irritation: ‘Qiaoqiao! How can you speak like that? Look how polite Young Master Fang is being! Apologize at once!’”

“Knowing her daughter would never comply, Wang Jie turned to Fang Su with an apologetic smile. ‘Please forgive her. We’ve spoiled her rotten, hence this awful temper. But I’m sure frequent contact with someone as refined as you will mellow her soon.’”

“‘Of course! I’ll take excellent care of Qiaoqiao,’ Fang Su replied, beaming.”

“‘Of course your fat head!’ Qiaoqiao shot back. ‘Who wants to spend time with you? Why don’t you take a piss and look at yourself in the puddle? You’re built like a beluga whale!’”

“Guan Yu couldn’t resist glancing at Fang Su. She wasn’t wrong—the man’s ill-fitting suit draped over his portly frame did evoke marine mammals. ‘Brilliant analogy,’ Guan Yu chuckled, giving Qiaoqiao a thumbs-up. ‘Spot-on observational skills.’”

“Qiaoqiao lifted her chin triumphantly. ‘Obviously.’”

“Though seething inside, Fang Su maintained a gentlemanly facade for her parents’ sake. His father Fang Wenjian, however, lost patience. ‘Let’s end this farce, Lin,’ he said icily. ‘Your daughter isn’t just rude—she’s utterly uncouth. What exactly is she implying with these theatrics?’”

“Fang Su had been waiting for his father’s intervention. The pressure worked—the Lin couple clearly coveted the Fang family’s status. Wang Jie, ever the social climber, panicked at the thought of losing their golden ticket. ‘Oh, she’s just spirited!’ she simpered. ‘We’ll correct her manners, I promise!’”

“‘Manners aren’t taught to idiots,’ Fang Wenjian sneered. ‘If not for my son’s infatuation, I’d have left already.’ Lin Zhiyu kept silent, knowing their fate now rested entirely on Fang Su’s whims.”

“Wang Jie desperately signaled Qiaoqiao to apologize, but the girl stared blankly ahead. When forced to chastise her daughter publicly, Qiaoqiao exploded: ‘Since when is honesty illegal? Who are you to judge me?’”

“‘You’re utterly uncivilized!’ Fang Wenjian turned to his son. ‘Why choose this shrew when you could have any woman?’”

“This struck deep—the Lin parents had never disciplined their precious daughter. Hearing her called ‘uncivilized’ felt like a personal attack. As Lin Zhiyu tensed to retaliate, Fang Su intervened: ‘I adore her exactly as she is!’”

“‘You’re courting disaster,’ Fang Wenjian muttered, collapsing into his seat. Undeterred, Fang Su declared: ‘I’ll pursue you relentlessly, Qiaoqiao! You’ll change for me once we’re together!’”

“His speech moved even Guan Yu momentarily. The Lin parents’ anger dissolved into hopeful anticipation. ‘See?’ Wang Jie gushed, clutching Qiaoqiao’s arm. ‘Such devotion! A man you can’t find even with a lantern!’”

“Guan Yu smirked. ‘Funny—I don’t recall noticing these stellar qualities. Qiaoqiao, do you see any?’”

“‘None!’ she chirped. ‘Guan Yu’s handsomer, taller, classier—every way superior! Speaking of—meet my chosen fiancé! His wealth dwarfs the Fangs’ petty millions!’”

“Stepping forward, Guan Yu bowed. ‘Honored to meet you.’ Wang Jie gaped. ‘Richer than the Fangs?!’ That single phrase transformed her demeanor.”

“‘Impossible!’ Lin Zhiyu spluttered. ‘The Fangs are top-tier wealthy! Who is this nobody?’ Fang Su scoffed: ‘I know every magnate in town. This pauper’s “pocket money” claims are laughable!’”

“‘Millions might be exaggerated,’ Guan Yu conceded. ‘But your family’s coffers? Pocket change.’ The room buzzed with disbelief. Fang Su sneered: ‘Bravo on the bluff!’”

“‘It’s fact!’ Qiaoqiao fired back. ‘Jealous?’ Guan Yu hid a smile—her childish head-shaking antics were unexpectedly endearing.”

“Fang Wenjian stormed out. ‘Wait!’ Lin Zhiyu pleaded, but the older man shook him off. ‘This ends now!’”

“Qiaoqiao clung to Guan Yu. ‘Why stay?’ she taunted Fang Su. ‘Want to watch us make out?’ Before anyone reacted, she planted a loud kiss on Guan Yu’s cheek—leaving everyone, including him, stunned.”

“Fang Su’s eyes bulged. ‘This isn’t over!’ he snarled at Guan Yu before stomping out. ‘Mind the traffic,’ Guan Yu called sweetly.”

“As the door slammed, Wang Jie moaned: ‘You’ve ruined everything!’ Qiaoqiao hugged her. ‘Silly Mama! We’ve gained Guan Yu—a catch beyond dreams! He outshines Fang Su in every way!’”

“Guan Yu hesitated—their act should’ve ended with the Fangs’ exit. But Qiaoqiao’s frantic blinking signaled otherwise. The parents turned to him. ‘How long have you two...?’ Wang Jie began.”

“Qiaoqiao cut in: ‘I told you weeks ago! You weren’t listening!’ Her parents exchanged blank looks—a perfect distraction. ‘You never care about me!’ she pouted. Guan Yu bit his cheek—her manipulation was masterful.”

“Lin Zhiyu finally addressed Guan Yu: ‘If you’re truly her choice, answer this...’ He trailed off, deferring to his wife. ‘How serious is this?’ Wang Jie demanded. Before Guan Yu could speak, Qiaoqiao interjected: ‘We’re taking it slow! I mentioned him before—you just ignored me!’”

“‘Did she?’ Wang Jie asked her husband. ‘You were too busy fawning over the Fangs to notice!’ he retorted. Qiaoqiao crossed her arms. ‘See? You never listen!’ Guan Yu nearly laughed—her strategy was flawless.”
