“That’s perfect. Let me suggest a way for you to eat right now without anyone recognizing you. How does that sound?” Guan Yu said with a sly grin.

Jin Hua, observing his expression, immediately sensed his idea was far from proper. Yet curiosity compelled her to ask, “Really? What brilliant plan do you have? Let’s hear it.”

Guan Yu chuckled and pointed to a public restroom across the street. “Take your giant sausage there. If you remove your mask inside, no one will notice you. Heh heh.”

“Ugh! I knew you’d come up with some lousy idea!” Jin Hua complained, playfully pounding Guan Yu’s arm. “I’m not eating there—it stinks!”

Their flirtatious banter seemed oddly youthful for their middle-aged appearances, drawing sidelong glances from passersby. Jin Hua stared at the sausage in her hand, torn between craving and propriety. Guan Yu found her impatience amusing—she truly was a glutton at heart.

Though he rarely indulged in street food himself, deeming it unhygienic, Guan Yu couldn’t deny its tantalizing aroma. The sizzling sausages, despite his reservations, smelled irresistible.

“Why not wait?” he proposed. “If the vendor’s still there when we head back, I’ll buy you as many as you want. You can devour them at home immediately.”

Jin Hua sighed. “Fine, I’ll listen to you today. But since you’re not wearing a mask, why don’t you try one? Go on—take a bite!”

Guan Yu hesitated. While wary of questionable ingredients, he reasoned that countless people consumed such fare daily without apparent harm.

“Rich people are so fussy!” Jin Hua rolled her eyes. “I eat these all the time and I’m perfectly healthy. You pampered types crumble at the slightest hardship.”

Stung by her teasing, Guan Yu relented. “I’ve never had street sausage before… Well, no harm in trying. It does smell good.” He nearly mentioned the gourmet versions his live-in chef A-Mei prepared at Qiao Yuan District but stopped himself. The luxury estate remained a sore point—Jin Hua yearned to live there but couldn’t yet afford it.

The oversized sausage Jin Hua handed him dwarfed normal portions. “One’s enough for me,” Guan Yu protested. “I don’t have your bottomless stomach.”

“Pfft! A grown man with a lady’s appetite.” Jin Hua smirked. Guan Yu let the jab slide—their time together was precious, and her happiness mattered most.

“Men need to watch their figures too,” he countered. “Not all of us can gorge endlessly without consequences.”

Jin Hua waved this off. “With a house full of women and me by your side, why care about looks? Planning to charm more mistresses?”

Knowing when to retreat, Guan Yu gestured ahead. “Let’s see what the commotion is.”

A boisterous crowd had gathered further down the street. Jin Hua yanked Guan Yu’s arm, forcing him to jog while clutching his half-eaten sausage. Seizing a chance, he discreetly tossed it into a trash bin—running with food in hand felt undignified.

Pushing through the throng, they discovered two middle-aged women brawling violently. Clothing torn, limbs flailing, they rolled across the pavement as onlookers filmed the scandalous scene. A younger woman—presumably the mistress—was losing badly to her enraged opponent.

“If you ever cheat,” Jin Hua whispered sweetly, “I won’t bother with the other woman. I’ll just castrate you.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “You’ll never get the chance. Finding someone more captivating than you? Impossible.”

Their banter halted as a gaunt man pushed through the crowd. His ashen face confirmed him as the cheating husband. The original wife—a short-haired fury—redoubled her attacks on the disheveled mistress.

“Liang Yuefa, you bastard!” the wife screamed, clobbering her husband with a handbag when he shielded his lover. “I’ll drag you both to hell!”

As the bag’s contents—likely including heavy cosmetics—crashed against his skull, the man collapsed. Undeterred, the wife swung at the cowering mistress.

Jin Hua watched impassively. “Domestic affairs,” she murmured. “Best not interfere.”

When the vengeful spouse raised her bag for another strike, the crowd held its breath. Glass shattered within the purse as it descended—

Amid the chaos, Jin Hua teased, “Want to film this? I’ll lend you my phone.” Bystanders gaped at her反常 encouragement.

Guan Yu smoothly deflected: “I’d rather photograph you at home.” The crowd’s jealous men now understood her ploy—a loyalty test disguised as permission.

As the beaten husband groveled, his lover barely clothed, Guan Yu noted the围观者’s varying reactions: wives dragging away gawking husbands, lone men shamelessly recording, and one bold spectator even crouching behind the half-naked mistress for better angles.

When a nearby wife caught her husband filming, her slap echoed through the street: “You want to memorize that hussy? I’ll give you something unforgettable!”

The original wife, now utterly unhinged, swung her makeshift weapon with homicidal fury. The mistress screamed—

In the ensuing bedlam, Jin Hua leaned close. “Still think adultery’s glamorous?”

Guan Yu eyed the battered trio. “Some ‘freedoms’ aren’t worth the price.”

Around them, the crowd’s voyeuristic frenzy continued—a primal theater of lust, rage, and schadenfreude playing out under the city’s indifferent lights.
