Lying in bed for a long time without sleep, Guan Yu pondered many matters. Beside him, Lin Qiaoqiao's soft breathing indicated she had fallen asleep, likely exhausted from the day's journey. Heavy nasal sounds also drifted from the outer room—everyone had succumbed to slumber.

Guan Yu quietly rose, dressed silently, and stole outside. Emerging into the night, he walked toward the village entrance they had arrived through.

The earthen country road lay utterly still, not a breath of wind stirring. Midway along the path stood a figure swathed in a black greatcoat, head concealed beneath a large hood. Slung across their back gleamed a slender blade.

Second Only to Wolf stood motionless in the road. Approaching him, Guan Yu asked, "Aren't you exhausted? Found lodging yet?"

"I've been waiting to inspect that so-called Divine Tree with you," came the flat reply.

"You overheard our conversation earlier? Instead of wasting time eavesdropping on trivial tales, you should have sought proper rest."

"My lodging's already arranged—a derelict temple west of the village suffices for occasional repose."

Truth be told, Second Only to Wolf rarely rested. Even when Guan Yu slept, the warrior maintained vigilant proximity, ever responsible for his charge's safety.

Guan Yu knew full well his companion's hardships. Earlier, he'd suggested Second Only to Wolf travel openly with them, ensuring regular meals and proper bedding. But the free-spirited warrior had refused: "If I stride openly by your side, your would-be assassins will never show themselves. Where's the fun in that?" Thus he chose shadowed vigilance.

In truth, Guan Yu understood this hidden protection allowed detection of concealed threats that might escape notice through overt guarding.

"Let's visit the Divine Tree then," Guan Yu proposed. "See what marvels it holds." Together they moved toward the village outskirts.

As they walked, Second Only to Wolf remarked, "Xue Jing contacted me earlier, inquiring about our situation. I covered for you completely."

Guan Yu shot him a curious glance. "Out with it. What's your real meaning?"

"I merely remind you not to let feigned affections become real. Lin Qiaoqiao and Xiao Zhu clearly cling to you deliberately. Maintain proper boundaries."

"Naturally I'm aware. But as a man, should I reject such exquisite company? Would you?" Though recognizing the girls' intentions, Guan Yu prided himself on resisting temptation where lesser men would succumb.

"When Sakurako loved you," Second Only to Wolf continued, "I knew she'd never find true happiness. Material comforts I could provide, but emotionally..." He trailed off meaningfully.

Realizing this was reprimand for Sakurako's sake, Guan Yu retorted, "The women in Qiaoyuan District seem content enough without complaint."

Hearing such callousness, Second Only to Wolf nearly kicked him.

"You hoard beauties at home yet stray like a tomcat! Soon your precious villa won't hold all your conquests," the warrior sneered.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Then I'll simply build Qiaoyuan District Phase Two!"

"Shameless fool."

Reaching the village entrance, they beheld the massive tree. Even disregarding legends, its imposing presence exuded solemn majesty. A burbling stream flowed eastward beneath roots naturally arched into a meter-wide bridge spanning three-meter waters.

"Fascinating how roots formed this crossing," Guan Yu observed.

"Not natural," Second Only to Wolf countered. "These roots were manipulated. Observe—this thicker one emerged earthward but was bent back to form the bridge. Many roots show forced redirection, some twisted like hemp cords."

Examining the indicated roots, Guan Yu conceded the point. Such contortions defied natural growth patterns. "But who shaped them? Certainly not current villagers who revere it as toxic."

"How discern this?" Guan Yu inquired, impressed.

"In my homeland," the warrior explained, "I witnessed greater marvels—ancient trees whose roots were guided across chasms to form bridges. Time entwined them into sturdy crossings."

"Or perhaps," Guan Yu mused, "this Divine Tree possesses consciousness? What if it shaped itself thus?"

"Preposterous! Do you believe your own words?"

Guan Yu shrugged. "After witnessing cultivation masters, demonic artifacts, and brain seals, why not sentient trees? This world defies normality."

Though skeptical of vegetal consciousness, Second Only to Wolf couldn't deny the world's strangeness. Guan Yu pressed: "Recall the tales—its leaves never fall and hold deadly poison. Shall we test this?"

"Risk unleashing plague? Better you swing the blade." The warrior offered his sword.

Snatching the weapon, Guan Yu nearly struck before reconsidering. "I'll scratch submerged roots instead. Any poison would tint the water without gaseous release."

As Guan Yu cautiously extended the blade toward water, a shout startled them: "You there! What mischief?"

An elderly man materialized, leaning on a cane. His piercing gaze swept the intruders. "This is our sacred tree! Outsiders linger at their peril!"

Noting the warrior's formidable aura, the elder tempered his wrath. Villagers revered this tree, crossing its root-bridge with reverent steps or wading through stream to avoid desecration.

Guan Yu recognized a cultivator's keen eyes, though gauging strength proved difficult. Second Only to Wolf suddenly barked: "Return my blade! Cease dunking it!"

"You've lurked here suspiciously!" Guan Yu shot back theatrically. "Planning sacrilege!"

Their staged quarrel confused the elder. Second Only to Wolf played along: "Heard rumors of monsters, found only this odd tree."

"Divine Tree, you impudent—" the elder spluttered. "Begone!"

As the warrior vanished into darkness, Guan Yu faced the elder alone. Their ruse served to position Guan Yu as protector—now to cement this role.

"I chased off that desecrator!" Guan Yu declared. "Couldn't sleep, came investigating. Thought him a monster at first."

"Who hosts you?" the elder demanded.

"Xiao Zhu's aunt—Wen Hua's family? Maternal relative." Guan Yu gambled.

The elder's eyes narrowed. "Wen Xiao Zhu? Wen family's in-law?" Suspicion lingered, but the intact tree and Guan Yu's "heroics" stayed his tongue. The night's mysteries deepened as moonlight silvered the ancient roots, holding secrets yet unguessed.
