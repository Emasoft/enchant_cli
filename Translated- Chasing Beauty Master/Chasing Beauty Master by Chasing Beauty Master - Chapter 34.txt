Standing by the window, Feng Xin watched Guan Yu stride out resolutely, his figure growing smaller in the distance without a backward glance. Tears of anger welled in her eyes as she stamped her feet repeatedly.

"You jerk! Would it kill you to sweet-talk me a bit? Stubborn as a mule! So infuriating!" Feng Xin pouted, rolling her eyes incessantly.

He was gone... A hollow emptiness settled in Feng Xin's chest. The monotonous routine she'd grown accustomed to had briefly gained color with Guan Yu's presence—now she'd driven that away with her own scolding. She pursed her lips helplessly.

"Serves him right! Peeping at me while I slept, crouching by the bed to glimpse under my skirt..." Feng Xin snorted listlessly, sinking onto the edge of the bed to fiddle with her fingers, her thoughts unreadable.

Half an hour later, Guan Yu marched back into Feng Xin's room. After knocking, he strode straight toward her.

"Twelve thousand here. The rest by tomorrow noon." He slapped a stack of bills onto her bedside table before turning sharply to leave.

Seeing him return, Feng Xin's eyes lit up with a jolt of hope—but before she could speak, he tossed the money and spun away.

"Hey... you—stop!" she blurted, rising hastily to clutch his shirt hem.

Guan Yu halted but didn't turn, his back remaining rigid as he waited.

"Take this money back. I... I don't want it," Feng Xin murmured softly, consciously softening her usually icy tone as she timidly studied his silhouette.

"Sis, what do you actually want? You told me to scram, then stopped me. Demanded repayment, and now refuse the money? Out with it—do you want my life? Take it then!" Guan Yu whirled around coldly, fury breaking through as he glared at her.

"Wh-what's with the attitude! I... I don't want money. You saw what you shouldn't have—you have to take responsibility!" Feng Xin jutted her chin defiantly. Though his stern expression unnerved her, she'd never apologize!

"Responsibility how?" Guan Yu inhaled deeply, rolling his eyes.

"Hmph! Until I marry or get a boyfriend, you're my stand-in. You'll care for me and be accountable..."

"What twisted logic is this?" Guan Yu gaped. This was worse than being sold into half-year servitude for 24k! One accidental glance and he's shackled for life? "Are you joking?!" he snapped.

"What? You object?" Feng Xin's face darkened as she glowered.

"Fine, sis—how about I gouge my eyes out? Will that suffice?" he asked bitterly.

"You..." Feng Xin's heart wrenched as if stabbed. Was she so repulsive? Many men pursued her—yet he'd rather blind himself!

Seeing her furious pout, tears shimmering as she looked pitifully small, Guan Yu's resolve softened. Men couldn't bear women's tears.

**Chapter Eighty: Temporary Boyfriend**

Guan Yu sighed in resignation. "Alright, alright! What do you want?"

"Make it right! Take responsibility!" Feng Xin mumbled with wounded pride.

"Fine! I'll take responsibility!" His heart had melted at her teary "tomboy" act. Damn it—when would this end? Only when she found a boyfriend? Ridiculous!

Worse, what privileges came with being this "temporary boyfriend"? Would holding hands be permitted? A kiss? His gaze drifted to her delicate face, anticipation flickering.

"Enough—I agreed! Stop sulking. Does your arm still hurt?" he asked gently.

"You tell me! Chasing you made my legs ache!" she retorted, icy demeanor resurfacing.

Instant reversion to her frosty self. This manly woman was unbearable! Guan Yu grimaced inwardly.

"Let me help you downstairs. Master's waiting."

"Call him Grandfather!" she snapped, glaring. Having him address her grandfather as "Master" lowered her status!

Damn—already demanding title changes? Under her threatening stare, he nodded reluctantly.

"I'm not going down! Take your stinking money!" She shoved the cash into his chest.

Guan Yu studied this mercurial enigma. A riddle of a woman...

"Back to your room then." He moved to support her arm.

As he reached out, she glared at his hand.

He stared at his grip on her arm. So much for hoping for hand-holding—even this provoked her!

"My legs hurt... Can't walk," she declared childishly.

"What? You sprinted after me like a rabbit earlier!"

"Carry me then!" She abruptly looped her arms around his neck.

"Damn, so eager despite 'pain'?" Muttering, he hoisted her up.

Perched on his back, Feng Xin secretly smirked in triumph before schooling her features. Her hair tickled his ear, carrying a floral scent. The press of her soft curves against him screamed "alluring beauty"—pity about her personality.

Entering her room, he deposited her on the bed. As she adjusted her skirt against exposure, the motion reminded him uncomfortably of certain... cinematic scenarios.

"Eyes to yourself!" she barked, catching his wandering gaze.

"Nothing worth seeing anyway," he taunted.

"You...!" She paled with anger.

"I'm hungry!" she announced haughtily.

"Hungry? You refused dinner earlier!"

"Can't squeeze milk from me!" He clutched his chest dramatically.

"Scram! Fetch my meal!"

Thus began his dual role—temporary boyfriend and errand boy. Would he end up washing her underwear next?

**Chapter Eighty-One: Feed Me**

Returning with food, he found Feng Xin burritoed in blankets, eyeing him expectantly.

"Eat up." He set the tray bedside.

"My arm hurts..." She picked at the food pitifully.

"Hurt from chasing me? Want a massage?"

"No!" She turned away.

"Not eating then?"

"Can't hold chopsticks!"

Exasperated, Guan Yu devoured the meal himself.

"Hey! Feed me!" she demanded.

"You're not a baby!"

"It's your duty as my boyfriend!"

"Temporary!"

"You're bullying me!" Her teary act melted his resolve.

Sighing, he began feeding her. She ate contentedly, smug between bites.

Afterward, Guan Yu rose. "Rest. I'm leaving." Night had fallen—he needed to retrieve his belongings before university orientation.

"Go then! Don't forget training with Grandfather tomorrow!" She dismissively rolled over.

So transactional! He exited, pondering their dynamic. Her vulnerable act always disarmed him—he needed thicker armor.

**Chapter Eighty-Two: Secret Affection**

Hailing a taxi outside the villa district, Guan Yu started when a black Mercedes pulled up.

Feng Xin lowered the window. "Waiting for a ride?"

"You should be resting!"

"None of your business! I'm... running errands!" She sped off angrily.

Idiot! She'd changed clothes specifically to drive him home, yet he'd questioned her! After circling back, she stopped again.

"Get in!"

"Why the change?"

"Pity. Don't flatter yourself."

"Need company?"

"Shut up, pest!"

As they drove, Feng Xin stole glances. Though loath to admit it, concern for him warmed her chest. This infuriating man... might just be etching himself into her heart.
