When she saw Yu Zhengchun, Ouyang Yihan initially felt terrified. However, witnessing Guan Yu and Du Xiaojuan's relaxed demeanor eased her tension. Being with Guan Yu indeed brought a sense of security, perhaps due to the composed aura he exuded. Ouyang Yihan never expected that Du Xiaojuan—who always appeared eloquent on television and decisive in actions—would tease her. Blushing slightly, she retorted, "Even if Manager Du isn't jealous, Liu Shilei would be."

Du Xiaojuan chuckled at Ouyang's reaction. "What's this? Has our young mistress developed feelings? If you're willing, I'll handle matters with Shilei."

Guan Yu sighed at the two women's banter. "Ladies, we're facing formidable opponents. Could you show some basic respect and seriousness?"

The four bodyguards behind Ouyang Yihan drew their pistols, barrels trained on Yu Zhengchun. Yet the latter ignored them completely, glaring venomously at Guan Yu. "You milk-fed brat putting on airs before women! I'll crush your balls soon—see how you'll posture then! Ouyang Yihan, your family stands on the brink of disaster, yet you frolic with this pretty boy? Don't you fear military intervention? Or do you doubt my capabilities?"

Chapter 1684: The Duel Outside the City

After accidentally encountering Guan Yu and learning his identity, Ouyang Yihan sensed this might be her family's only chance to escape their predicament. However, she remained uncertain of Guan Yu's true strength. Yu Zhengchun ranked among China's top-tier mutants, specializing in invisibility—even other first-class mutants reportedly struggled against him. Thus, she kept Guan Yu's existence secret from her family, merely claiming to meet friends for distraction during this outing with her guards.

As an established aristocratic clan, the Ouyang family had never faced such existential crisis. Two decades prior, their downfall would have been unthinkable. But the emergence of mutants now threatened to reshape national and global power structures.

The family's recent transgression—producing weapons capable of stripping mutant abilities for the treacherous Eastern Islands nation—had pushed China into perilous waters.

Ouyang Zhengdong understood the gravity of their actions. Though military measures seemed excessive, he harbored no resentment. Torn between protecting his daughter and safeguarding family interests, he found himself paralyzed.

Had Yu Zhengchun possessed Guan Yu's relatively youthful appearance, Ouyang Zhengdong might have urged his daughter to sacrifice herself for the clan. But Yu's repulsive demeanor sickened even him, making Ouyang Yihan's request to meet friends comprehensible.

In truth, Ouyang Yihan's invitation to the teahouse aimed to lure Yu Zhengchun into controlled territory. Any conflict between Guan Yu and Yu here would minimize collateral damage to her family.

When Yu addressed her, Ouyang suppressed her revulsion, responding coolly: "Great Master Yu, you claim you'll steal those weapons back from the Eastern Islands. But how can we trust your capability? If we accept your terms and you fail—or perish there—wouldn't our family still face destruction?"

Yu's eyes glued to Ouyang's chest, drool nearly dripping. "Heh, you've no choice. Become my wife, and I'll buy your family time through military connections. Even if I fail, you'll have breathing room. Refuse, and your clan gets eradicated in two days—you'll face secret execution. Choose between death or pleasuring me. Don't mind my age—I surpass that pretty boy in both size and stamina. Even if you've slept with him, I'll take used goods—broken-in women suit me better."

Guan Yu inwardly sighed. For all Yu's power as a top mutant surpassing martial artists, his character remained despicable. Such vulgarity before public audience...

Yu's lecherous gaze then fell on Du Xiaojuan. "Tsk! Never thought you'd bring the legendary Du Beauty! Countless ministers and governors failed to court her—yet I get to enjoy both! Planning to enlist her wealth? Useless—money can't save your family now!"

While Yu's harassment of Ouyang disgusted Guan Yu, targeting Du Xiaojuan crossed the line. Original plans to negotiate weapon replication vanished—now only Yu's death mattered.

Noticing Guan Yu's darkening expression, Du Xiaojuan gently squeezed his hand. "Too many bystanders here for confrontation."

Yu's jealousy erupted seeing their intimacy. "Fuck! What do women see in this silver-plated dud? Planned to spare you—now I'll kill you first!"

Guan Yu rose slowly, voice icy. "My thoughts exactly. Ten li east lies a hill—let's duel there without collateral damage."

Yu roared: "Fight here and now! What nonsense delays!"

Before he could act, the trio vanished. Yu—self-proclaimed master of movement—gaped at their disappearance. As he stood bewildered, Guan Yu's voice echoed: "I await at the eastern hill. Come meet your end."

This provoked Yu's fury: "Only three top mutants exist nationwide! Meng Feilong's in Y City with me—Hong Wudi vanished. You brat with parlor tricks dares threaten me? I'll crush both your balls!"

Yet inexplicable dread crept in. Before departing, Yu called Meng Feilong: "Come to the eastern hill."

At Black Dragon Society headquarters, Meng Feilong listened to his nephew Meng Fancheng's account of Guan Yu and Hou Jinshun's assault. "If that youth truly is the Guan Yu from twenty years ago... returning from the Divine Realm... we've provoked unimaginable power."

Meng Jin scoffed: "Brother, as top mutant, you fear some brat?"

Chapter 1685: Eastern Outskirts

Originally common thieves, Meng brothers rose through mutation's power—demonstrating mutants' profound societal impact.

Meng Fancheng—arm in sling from Hou's assault—reported: "Uncle, Guan Yu's definitely not mutant. If from Divine Realm, wouldn't he be? Transferred recently—Liu Shilei's cousin. Hou Jinshun was ordinary bartender until days ago. Yet now he fights like pseudo-psychic! What does that say about Guan Yu's power? That policewoman too... I'm certain—he's the legendary Guan Yu. Must verify his appearance. Yu needs me east—stay alert."

Leaping from eighth floor effortlessly, Meng Feilong raced to the site.

Fifteen minutes later, Yu arrived at the hill, finding Guan Yu waiting with both women. Seeing no vehicles, Yu sneered: "Boy, regardless of your background, this affair exceeds you. Withdraw now, and I'll forgive your insolence."

Detecting Yu's wavering resolve, Guan Yu smirked arrogantly: "Too late for humility. Grovel thrice to these ladies, call them 'Grandmother'—maybe I'll spare you."

Du Xiaojuan giggled: "Rascal! Making him call us both 'Grandmother' implies shared husband! So you did fancy Sister Ouyang!"

Ouyang sighed: "Manager Du, your composure astonishes."

Yu scanned surroundings again, then leered: "Sharp tongue, boy. After crippling you, I'll strip these bitches bare and perform live theater—let you watch real prowess!"

"Smash his teeth, Guan Yu!" Du Xiaojuan demanded coldly.

"With pleasure." Guan Yu's gaze turned glacial.

Yu vanished mid-sneer. Ouyang cried warning while drawing laser device—her family's genuine weaponry, though likely ineffective against mutants.

Unbeknownst to Yu, Guan Yu's spiritual sense tracked him perfectly. As Yu circled stealthily, Guan Yu feigned ignorance until the mutant lunged. With casual backhand, Guan Yu sent the invisible assailant flying—a crisp slap echoing across the hillside.

Ouyang cheered at Yu's pained yelp, though the mutant remained unseen.

Chapter 1686: Man or Ghost

Unaware of his exposure, Yu circled warily. His "invisibility"—mere light-bending trickery—paled against Guan Yu's teleportation arts, though overrated in this mundane world.

At three meters, Guan Yu's energy locked onto Yu completely. "This is your skill? You'd steal from Eastern Islands with this? Underestimating them much?"

Yu froze mid-lunge at Guan Yu's taunt. As he swung, Guan Yu's left hand conjured vortex—yanking Yu forward into a right-handed slap that sent him sprawling.

Ouyang cheered the invisible assailant's defeat, laser device ready. Guan Yu stood unfazed—his spiritual perception rendering Yu's tricks meaningless.
