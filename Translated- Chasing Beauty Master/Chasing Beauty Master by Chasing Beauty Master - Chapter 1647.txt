Hongren was exceedingly willing. Securing a position in the First Prince's residence was a status many coveted, and to think Hongren had obtained it so effortlessly—claiming he wasn't delighted would be a lie.

When Guanyu first approached him, speaking of protecting someone's safety, Hongren had merely found the compensation favorable. Little did he know this decision would irrevocably alter his life.

Within the First Prince's estate, Hongren now held the highest status after the prince himself. Moreover, he was diligently learning the skills of a steward. Should he eventually become the estate's head steward, his prospects would soar. If the First Prince favored him enough to request an official title from the Emperor, Hongren might ascend to become a high-ranking official.

Thus, Hongren brimmed with joy. If the First Prince one day ascended the throne, Hongren could rise to become Commander of the Imperial Guards or even Chancellor—all within the realm of possibility.

Anticipating such a glorious future, Hongren resolved to devote himself wholeheartedly to demonstrating his capabilities within the prince's household.

The company raised their cups in toast, even Qiqi lifting her water cup in imitation.

“Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves to the fullest tonight,” declared Prince Zou, resuming his seat. “As your host, I shall ensure we part only when thoroughly intoxicated.”

**Chapter 4301: The Unforeseen**

Seizing the moment, Guanyu stood and bowed to Prince Zou. “Your Highness, no feast lasts forever. Now that you've safely reached the capital and I've accompanied you through perilous journeys, I must bid farewell tomorrow. I shall depart with Dazi, Eryatou, and the others.”

Though reluctant to part with Guanyu, Prince Zou understood the inevitable. He deeply appreciated Xuanming for sending such a capable disciple from the Profound Enlightenment Sect for his protection.

“Men follow their own paths,” Prince Zou nodded. “I won't detain you. You've been the pillar of our company, Old Cang. Your services shall never be forgotten. When time permits, I shall visit. Convey my regards to your sect.”

Guanyu understood the gratitude was meant for Xuanming. Evidently, the sect leader still cared for this former Cloud Azure Sect member—or perhaps maintained secret ties.

Zou Wuhui then proposed, “Old Cang, let me toast you. Our safe arrival owes much to your efforts.”

After drinking, Guanyu continued, “Your Highness, this Hongren is my sworn brother. Though unrefined, he's courageous, loyal, and true. Prince Zou can attest to this. Should he err here, I beg your leniency.”

Hongren, moved by Guanyu's continued support, bowed his head.

“True words,” Prince Zou affirmed. “Hongren possesses both capability and the virtues Old Cang described. He never abandoned comrades, even in deadly battles.”

“Naturally,” the First Prince chuckled. “Anyone recommended by Your Highness is beyond question. Hence I entrusted him with estate security.”

**Chapter 4302: We've Met Before**

The banquet concluded merrily. At dawn, Wang Xiaorong sulked, dreading separation.

“Must you leave so soon?” she protested as they stood at the estate gates where Prince Zou bid farewell.

“Parting is inevitable,” Guanyu soothed. “An early return promises swifter reunion.”

Accepting a small box from the prince, Guanyu initially assumed it contained gold—the prince's customary gift—but found it surprisingly light.

“Convey my regards,” Prince Zou repeated. “Every banquet must end. Farewell.”

Once beyond the estate, Wang Xiaorong complained, “Must we ride back? It's too slow!”

“We'll find your Demon Soul Sect outpost,” Guanyu replied.

Guiding them to a large tavern marked by flame sigils, Wang Xiaorong flashed her Ghost Butterfly Token. The alarmed staff ushered them upstairs where a middle-aged woman bowed deeply.

“Young Mistress, had we known your visit—”

“Tea will suffice,” Wang Xiaorong interrupted.

Guanyu marveled at the respect shown this young woman by her elder.

“Cheer up,” he urged. “I'll return soon.”

“Promise?” she brightened. “When you emerge next, we'll journey through deserts together!”

After arranging winged escorts for Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, Guanyu entrusted their prized horses to sect members. With lingering glances, the trio departed.

**Chapter 4303: Merits**

At Cloud Azure Sect, Lu Shouzuo greeted them: “Enjoy your adventures, Guanyu?”

“Constant peril permits no leisure,” Guanyu retorted wryly.

In Tiger Peak Hall, Sect Leader Xuanming praised, “You've concealed our sect's involvement admirably. Rewards are due—though what remains for Guanyu?”

“My companions deserve recognition,” Guanyu deflected.

When Xiao Zhi requested the Spirit Beast Taming manual, Xuanming hesitated—this unorthodox text's origins troubled him. Turning to Wang Jun: “Your wish?”

“First address Xiao Zhi's petition,” Wang Jun demurred, strategically prolonging the negotiation.
