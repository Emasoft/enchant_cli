“We used to be just a couple of joke students,” Xiao Mu said. “But we stopped going this semester. School felt pointless—no future in it for us. Better to find real work. Then we heard Yu Gang’s leather factory was hiring, so here we are.”

Mei Ren nodded. “Lucky timing. The factory’s desperate for workers now. Yu Gang doesn’t usually hire outsiders. Work hard, and Yu Gang won’t treat you poorly.”

Even within the leather factory, Yu Gang members stood a cut above the rest. Veterans commanded respect—others bowed and scraped just to speak to them.

“Absolutely,” Xiao Mu replied between bites. “Landing jobs here is a blessing for us brothers. Meeting you today’s fate. We’ve admired Yu Gang forever—wanted to join, but never had the chance.”

Mei Ren eyed them, sensing their angle. “Joining’s simple. Just approach our hall master directly. But your backgrounds must be clean. If they’re not…” He trailed off ominously.

Xiao Mu feigned excitement. “Really? That’s perfect! Our records are spotless. How do we meet the hall master?”

“Easy. He’s at the factory almost daily. Find him tomorrow morning. Whether he accepts you?” Mei Ren shrugged. “That’s up to him.”

Xiao Mu glanced around the rectangular table where eight men ate. “This is fantastic!” He beamed. “You’re all Yu Gang veterans, right? Risked life and limb together. We’re envious. Let us treat everyone to a night out—our humble gesture of respect.”

Mei Ren hid his satisfaction. Free entertainment? Tempting. But he played coy. “Depends if the brothers are interested.”

The others yearned to unwind after work but waited for Mei Ren’s cue.

“Since you’re so earnest,” Mei Ren finally said, “we’ll honor your request.”

His crew—master actors all—masked their glee with reluctant murmurs:

“Guess we’ll go.”

“Humoring the newbies, I suppose.”

“Had plans, but if Mei Ren says yes…”

Mei Ren turned to Xiao Mu. “Rare honor, this. Where are we headed?”

“Heard a massive new casino opened today,” Xiao Mu said. “Let’s gamble first, then hit a bar—one girl per brother. Sound good?”

At the mention of women, Mei Ren grinned. “Lead the way.”

As they drove toward Ma Tong’s casino, Xiao Mu smirked. Tonight’s scheme was nearly complete. After this performance, Young Master Fang Su would reward him handsomely.

In the casino, Fang Su and Bi Erlin flirted with dealers, oblivious to their own mission.

“You’re a gambling god—a losing god!” Fang Su teased as Bi Erlin dropped another chip.

“Strategy,” Bi Erlin retorted. “Letting the dealer earn commissions. Chivalry, really.”

“Bullshit. If I wanted to impress her, I’d dump all my chips at once.”

“The emperor isn’t worried, but the eunuch is anxious,” Bi Erlin snapped.

Spotting Xiao Mu’s group arrive, Fang Su nudged him. “They’re here.”

After theatrically inviting the dealer to their luxury cars, the duo fled before violence erupted.

“Your men better deliver,” Bi Erlin said in the parking lot.

“Relax. Those ‘Yu Gang’ fools will rattle Ma Tong enough to ally with us.”

At the casino’s second floor, Mei Ren gaped at the opulence. “Impressive. Surprised I hadn’t heard.”

Xiao Mu handed out chips. “Enjoy yourselves. My treat.”

Mei Ren’s eyes lit up. “Generous! Let’s play!”

At the poker table, Mei Ren hesitated over a bet.

“Hurry up, granny!” a player sneered.

“Who you calling granny?” Mei Ren barked. “I’m Yu Gang! Watch your mouth!”

The man scoffed. “Yu Gang? Bunch of turtles.”

When the dealer urged him to bet, Mei Ren exploded. “You dare rush me? I’ll break you!”

As tensions flared, Xiao Mu watched from the shadows. Perfect.
