Looking at Qiqi’s deliberately exaggerated pout, Guan Yu felt both exasperated and amused. “On the way back, Jiang Xin said she was cold, so I used flight magic to take her home directly. That’s all there was to it. Maybe that’s why I ended up carrying her scent after flying with her for so long,” he quickly explained, sensing the lingering fragrance on his clothes.

“And that flight took a full four hours, didn’t it?” Qiqi grumbled, her frustration evident. At this point, no explanation from Guan Yu would suffice—he had been caught red-handed, leaving him no room to argue.

Both Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong clearly understood: if Guan Yu had truly been discussing matters with Jiang Yuan, the scent would have faded long ago. But now, given how recently he must have parted from Jiang Xin, his excuses held no weight, no matter how elaborate.

“I discussed some matters with Jiang Yuan regarding the East Sea Treasure,” Guan Yu swiftly redirected the conversation. “It seems I can’t prioritize searching for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique anymore. Instead, I must collaborate with Jiang Yuan to locate the East Sea first. I believe once we find the treasure, the final part of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique will reveal itself.”

He continued, “I already possess three volumes of the technique. If I obtain the last one, I can fully master it and finally break the seal in my mind.”

“Really? That’s wonderful!” Wang Xiaorong chimed in brightly. “I truly hope you find the final volume soon.” She was convinced only Guan Yu could attain it.

Yet, uncertainties loomed. Guan Yu knew the trials ahead—securing the East Sea Treasure would prove far more perilous than previous endeavors. While the Eight-Sided Drum Technique had been a matter for cultivators, with only sects vying for it, the treasure now drew countless factions, even demonic beings, all hungry for its legendary wealth.

**Chapter 5001: To Be Discussed Another Day**

Previously, Guan Yu’s adversaries had been limited—the Demon Soul Sect, Red Lotus Sect, and True Sun Sect. But this time, martial sects and opportunistic clans alike would swarm like vultures. While others sought riches, Guan Yu’s goal remained the technique.

He had assumed knowledge of the technique’s location was exclusive to him and the Demon Soul Sect. Yet, fate intertwined it with the East Sea Treasure—a secret now known to all, thanks to the cryptic verses:

*Boundless azure seas, valleys at heaven’s edge,*
*Dragon pearls as treasure, divine arts fill the streets.*

These lines undoubtedly pointed to the treasure. To find the technique, Guan Yu first had to locate the East Sea—a place shrouded in millennia of obscurity. Even Dai Xiaotian, the former martial alliance leader, and his famed wife Qiao Mei had never spoken of it. Now, merely pinpointing the sea’s location seemed an insurmountable task.

Key questions demanded answers: Where exactly was the East Sea? Was Qiao Mei truly its princess? Why had the Dragon Pearl surfaced in the Swordless Villa? How much did demonic forces know? Unraveling these mysteries would bring them closer to the treasure.

Meanwhile, desperate thieves had kidnapped Chu Fan, though Guan Yu doubted Jiang Yuan would trade the Dragon Pearl for a mere actor’s life. To save Chu Fan, Guan Yu needed to investigate the capital’s undercurrents.

After placating Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong with promises of a lavish meal, Guan Yu took them to the only upscale restaurant he knew—Wanyang Tavern. As they entered, Duan Ruxue approached with a cordial greeting.

Before Guan Yu could reply, he felt the icy glares of Qiqi and Xiaorong behind him—fresh from Jiang Xin’s drama, now confronted by Duan Ruxue.

“Miss Duan, what a coincidence,” Guan Yu replied politely before swiftly ushering the girls upstairs, eager to avoid further provocation.

“In such a hurry, Young Master Wan Hong?” Duan Ruxue called after him. “I’d hoped to discuss matters with you.”

“Apologies,” Guan Yu said, “perhaps another day.”

As they ascended, they crossed paths with Tang Muchen, whose wary glance betrayed no hostility. Tang’s gaze lingered on Qiqi and Xiaorong, recalling Qu Hua’s brutal fate at their hands. He wisely retreated, muttering about seeking Duan Ruxue instead.

Guan Yu suspected the Tang family might be behind Chu Fan’s abduction. Meanwhile, he had tasked Du Teng and Hong Ren with gathering intelligence, planning to investigate the Second Prince’s estate that night.

**Chapter 5002: Judging Others**

Downstairs, Tang Muchen sneered to Duan Ruxue, “Wan Hong acts so aloof, as if we owe him gold. A mere provincial merchant frequenting *our* tavern—how presumptuous!”

Duan Ruxue disagreed. To her, Guan Yu exuded an intriguing mystique. Their recent alliance had dissolved after Tang’s ruthless takeover of the Cao family’s textile trade—a move that alienated Duan.

“Spare me your critiques,” Duan retorted coldly. “State your business or leave.”

Tang attempted to salvage relations, inviting her to discuss collaborations, but Duan dismissed him. “We walk separate paths now.”

After a sumptuous feast—devoured by Qiqi, nibbled by Xiaorong—Guan Yu prepared to stroll the bustling streets. Yet Duan Ruxue awaited him outside, resplendent in a tailored pink qipao that defied local fashion yet accentuated her grace.

“Young Master Wan Hong,” she entreated, “might we converse?”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu agreed, sending Qiqi and Xiaorong back. Duan led him to a private room, where vintage Nü'er Hong (Daughter's Red Wine) awaited.

**Chapter 5003: Breaking Protocol**

“Let’s dispense with formalities,” Guan Yu urged as Duan poured wine for them both.

“First, a toast,” she insisted, downing her cup—a bold act for one unaccustomed to liquor.

As the drink’s warmth spread, Duan broached her true intent: strengthening ties with Guan Yu. Yet he remained guarded, suspecting ulterior motives tied to the East Sea’s allure.

Meanwhile, his mind raced—every faction, even the Tangs and Duan herself, could be scheming for the treasure. Trust was a luxury he couldn’t afford.

The night’s negotiations had only just begun.
