“It’s no longer a matter that can be resolved with Ah Cai’s head, so that’s useless now. This is a contest of endurance between Guan Yu and the fake Laila.”

“When you first entered, I knew you were lying. You’re from Huaxia. Though my English isn’t fluent, I could tell from your conversation with Lai Li—your pronunciation is too precise, nothing like someone who’s lived here long-term.”

“This proves you aren’t a local. Moreover, your Huaxia dialect is impeccable, specifically the Northern City accent. I concluded you’re Huaxian. Lai Li once described her hometown, so I knew you were an imposter.”

“I didn’t expose you earlier because I knew you were after Ah Cai. He mentioned your organization’s vast reach, so I feared ambushes. After leaving to gather reinforcements, I returned to find you孤立无援.”

“The situation is clear now. If you don’t harm Lai Li, I guarantee your safe departure. Otherwise, a bullet might find your skull any second.”

Guan Yu mimed a pistol with his hand, pointing it mockingly at the fake Laila.

Unfazed, the fake Laila retorted coldly, “A joke. Since I’m here, I’m confident in completing Ah Cai’s assassination. Do you think I came alone? I’ve already signaled the organization. Backup will arrive soon. With a hostage, why should I fear you?”

“Stop deluding yourself. I know how your organization operates. Ah Cai told me internal competition is cutthroat. If you fail, no one will aid you—even if you die here, they’ll abandon your corpse and plan anew.”

Guan Yu’s words struck true. The fake Laila had boasted she’d return with Ah Cai’s head, yet now faced utter defeat. She hadn’t expected Guan Yu to know so much about the organization—likely from Ah Cai’s leaks.

“Ridiculous! Ah Cai was a lowly pawn. His knowledge is pitiful and unreliable. A nobody’s death goes unnoticed. But I’m high-ranking—you think I’d be treated like trash?” The fake Laila smirked, feigning confidence.

Meanwhile, Jin Hua and Ah Cai sprang into action. Upon hearing Guan Yu’s claim of sniper support, Jin Hua devised a plan. Without a sniper rifle, they improvised.

After ten minutes of scavenging the homeowner’s越野车, they found an automatic pistol, a shotgun (though without shells), and a telescope. “This’ll work!” Jin Hua grinned, climbing a towering poplar with sparrow-like agility. Ah Cai gaped—even as a Third-Level尊, he couldn’t match her轻功.

From the tree, Jin Hua angled镜片 to reflect sunlight. Inside, the fake Laila recoiled as a blinding glare hit her eyes—mistaking it for a sniper’s scope. Panicked, she dragged Lai Li into the kitchen.

Jin Hua’s light trick convinced the fake Laila snipers surrounded her. Spotting Ah菜 brandishing a shotgun outside (harmless without ammo), her resolve wavered.

“Your ‘backup’ isn’t coming,” Guan Yu pressed. “Surrender, and walk away alive.”

“Let me leave with the girl, or we all die!” The fake Laila pressed a dagger to Lai Li’s throat. “Thirty seconds to withdraw your men!”

Guan Yu feigned compliance, discarding his phone and stripping his shirt. Jin Hua, circling to the backyard, prepared香毒气—a colorless knockout gas. As it spread, Guan Yu stalled: “My snipers are leaving. Wait five minutes.”

The fake Laila, growing dizzy, rashly pulled a grenade. “Try anything, and we all burn!”

Guan Yu steadied his voice: “Easy. Let’s talk this through.” Secretly, he palmed a dagger, ready to strike. To him, the fake Laila was already a corpse—just a matter of timing.

As the toxin took effect, Guan Yu’s act of negotiation masked his disdain. “Choose: release her and live, or die here.”

Enraged, the fake Laila began counting down. Guan Yu’s hidden blade gleamed—a gift from Jin Hua. The standoff climaxed; one twitch could doom Lai Li.

But Jin Hua’s毒气 prevailed. The fake Laila swayed, grip faltering. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu’s dagger flew—a silver flash piercing her wrist. The grenade clattered harmlessly as she collapsed.

“Checkmate,” Guan Yu murmured, catching the unconscious Lai Li. Outside, Jin Hua descended, grinning. “Took you long enough.”

Ah Cai stared in awe. The “sniper support” had been a telescope and sunlight. Yet the ruse worked—proof that sometimes, ingenuity outguns firepower.
