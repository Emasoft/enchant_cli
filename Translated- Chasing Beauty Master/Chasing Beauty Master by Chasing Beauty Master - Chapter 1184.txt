Lin Qiaoqiao felt increasingly helpless, utterly disgusted by the lecherous gaze of that Short Gourd yet compelled to maintain her ladylike composure. She firmly believed Guan Yu would defeat this repulsive man, so anxiety didn't plague her heart.

Guan Yu observed the situation coldly. This dwarfish man wasn't just a lecherous toad—his slobbering ogling of Lin Qiaoqiao prompted a bitter chuckle. Before the elderly announcer could finish speaking, Short Gourd gestured impatiently, as if declaring, *"Next challenger! Hurry up! Don't delay me from claiming my bride!"*

His comically stubby legs waddled like a bipedal chimpanzee, provoking uproarious laughter from the crowd. While most mocked his shameless antics, others seized the opportunity to tarnish the Lin family's reputation. Cruel jabs flew—"The Lin family's son-in-law is a freak!" "Soon their affairs will be managed by someone shorter than three cow patties!" Clearly, these were grievances long festering in the shadows.

Lin Zhonggeng, the Lin patriarch, sat unflustered amidst the chaos. Years of experience armored him against such petty provocations. Below the stage, several men who had ritually washed their hands in the bronze basin already slunk away,自知不敌 rather than face humiliation. Yet a few remained, lured by Lin Qiaoqiao's beauty and the family's wealth.

"Since we've cleansed our hands," one shouted, "let's challenge him! Even defeat is preferable to regret. It's just a spar—no lives will be lost!" His rallying cry stirred others. Soon, challengers ascended the stage one after another, only to be brutally defeated.

Guan Yu noted grimly that Short Gourd struck lethally even when victory was assured, targeting vital points mercilessly. This wasn’t mere lust—the man radiated malice. Some challengers displayed genuine skill, channeling inner qi, while others relied on brute strength. The latter were promptly kicked offstage like ragdolls.

"I'll try!" boomed a gruff voice, cutting through the din. The crowd turned as one. Guan Yu stepped back to glimpse the speaker but stumbled, his heel grinding into something soft.

"Apologies," Guan Yu said, turning to find a cloaked figure. "I didn’t see your foot."

"Apology accepted?" hissed the stranger. "You ground your heel like milling wheat!"

A towering bystander interjected, "Such insolence! You tread on a man then blame him?"

Guan Yu glared. "Since when do meddlers police others' quarrels?"

The giant huffed, "In my village, manners matter. You city folk..."

Meanwhile, the challenger mounted the stage—a mountainous man weighing over 300 pounds, his neck buried in folds of flesh, eyes reduced to slits by bloated lids. The stark contrast between him and the diminutive Short Gourd drew gasps.

Despite his bulk, the newcomer moved with startling agility. Guan Yu realized Short Gourd's reliance on inner qi for speed would be his undoing. True martial prowess required physical cultivation, not just energy expenditure.

*"First-Class Adept!"* Guan Yu muttered as blue lightning crackled from the giant's slender sword—a signature of elite mastery. Short Gourd scrambled like a electrocuted monkey, his spear abandoned as he dodged sizzling arcs. The crowd roared when a final bolt hurled him offstage.

Lin Qiaoqiao paled. First a repulsive toad, now this behemoth? She glanced desperately at Guan Yu, who whispered strategy with Lin Zhonggeng.

"We must substitute my friend," Guan Yu urged. "He'll fight under my name."

As the announcer declared the giant—Yu Shida—the victor, Guan Yu spotted Li Gui smirking in the crowd. The Li family's hand was evident. This mercenary hadn’t come for marriage but to humiliate the Lins.

"Can you defeat him?" Lin Zhonggeng pressed.

Guan Yu shook his head. "But my friend can." He nodded to the cloaked figure—Second-to-Wolf, his loyal guardian. The ruse was set: Second-to-Wolf would don Guan Yu's identity and face the colossus.

Onstage, Yu Shida stood triumphant, lightning flickering at his blade's tip. The crowd held its breath. Somewhere, a cricket chirped. Then, with a swirl of his cloak, Second-to-Wolf ascended the steps.

Lin Qiaoqiao's nails dug into her palms. Tonight, either her family's honor would burn... or a wolf would feast.
