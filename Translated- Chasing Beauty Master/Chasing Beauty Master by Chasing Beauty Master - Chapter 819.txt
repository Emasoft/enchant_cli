After activating his shield, Guan Yu self-destructed it with a thunderous boom just as he was about to make contact with the crocodiles. At this critical moment, detonating the shield was the only solution he could devise to buy himself precious time.

The explosion achieved decent results, blasting a large portion of the crocodile ladder back down. Clutching a dagger that had somehow appeared in his hand, Guan Yu stabbed it fiercely into the tree trunk, leaving him dangling mid-air with a pallid face.

Having secured a foothold, Guan Yu faced the frenzied crocodiles below—scrambling over each other like ants on a hot griddle. With a forceful twist of his wrist, he leveraged momentum to vault upward again. Simultaneously, he hurled another knife toward the cobra’s head, which had already lunged toward Jin Hua (Golden Flower).

The cobra’s gaping maw was large enough to swallow Jin Hua’s entire upper body. But the sudden knife struck deep into its mouth. Recoiling in pain, the serpent retracted instantly. Overwhelmed by agony from the blade embedded in its jaw, its coiled grip on the trunk loosened, sending it plummeting downward.

The five-meter-long cobra crashed into the crocodile horde below. The ravenous reptiles tore it apart in seconds, devouring it alive. Whether the cobra’s venom affected them remained unclear, but Guan Yu’s knife—now lodged permanently in their guts—would bring misfortune to whichever beast ingested it.

Jin Hua (Golden Flower) trembled with cold sweat, not for herself but for Guan Yu. Moments earlier, paralyzed with panic, she had watched helplessly as he fell, wishing desperately for wings to swoop down and save him. Guan Yu, too, paled with fear—not for his own sake, but imagining Jin Hua (Golden Flower) swallowed whole by the cobra. Only his last-second knife throw had averted disaster.

When Guan Yu climbed back up, Jin Hua (Golden Flower) burst into tears, throwing herself into his arms. “You scared me to death!” she sobbed repeatedly between gasps.

“There, there. It’s over,” Guan Yu comforted, gently patting her shoulder. “I’m fine. But you nearly gave me a heartattack! Why didn’t you defend against that cobra? Never risk yourself like that again.”

Jin Hua (Golden Flower) nodded, murmuring, “I was too worried about you to notice the cobra. If something happened to you, my life would mean nothing. I wouldn’t want to live alone.”

“Don’t say such things!” Guan Yu chided mildly. “You’re young, with your whole life ahead. Never throw it away lightly.”

“But I can’t live without you!” Jin Hua (Golden Flower) pouted. “You fell because you saved me. If you died, how could I go on?”

“I won’t die. I’ve too many dreams left unfulfilled,” Guan Yu replied firmly. “You must adopt the same mindset, understand?”

Jin Hua (Golden Flower) giggled through tears. “I know you’d never die easily. If you did, all those women at home would become widows. Heehee!”

“Cheeky.” Guan Yu flicked her petite nose playfully. “Aren’t you one of ‘those women’?”

“Of course not! I’m your woman on the outside.” She clung to him tighter.

“Silly girl.” They held each other as the crocodiles below finally retreated, abandoning their assault. Just as Guan Yu began to relax, strange cat-like yowls echoed from the forest’s depths—rapidly approaching.

Soon, the ground trembled as if stampeded by an army. From his perch, Guan Yu glimpsed hordes of beasts surging toward them—some leaping between trees with alarming speed. Their shrill, grating cries crescendoed.

“Trouble. These monsters can climb trees,” Guan Yu muttered.

The creatures resembled lions but bore single sharp horns atop their heads and long, dragging chin fur. Their roars pierced the air as they swarmed. Guan Yu summoned his shield, enveloping Jin Hua (Golden Flower) within its protective glow. The sheer number of horned beasts made his scalp prickle.

Their speed and arboreal agility spelled true danger. Within moments, the creatures reached them, attacking without hesitation. Though lion-like in build and movement, their strikes proved weaker than expected. Guan Yu and Jin Hua (Golden Flower) fended off the onslaught, noting curiously that most beasts targeted the crocodiles instead.

Below, the crocodiles stood their ground, their armored hides repelling the horned attackers. Yet overwhelmed by numbers, even their powerful tails could only deter so many. The horned beasts seemed intent on driving the crocodiles out rather than slaughtering them.

Guan Yu realized the truth: This was the horned beasts’ territory, and the earlier commotion had provoked their invasion. Though they succeeded in repelling the crocodiles, the cost was steep—dozens of their own lay dead.

As the crocodiles retreated, the horned beasts turned their fury upward. But shielded within Guan Yu’s protective barrier, the duo endured the relentless assault. Spotting an opportunity, Guan Yu scooped Jin Hua (Golden Flower) into a princess carry and leaped toward the fleeing crocodiles, baiting both predators into collision.

Enraged crocodiles turned back, clashing violently with the horned beasts. Guan Yu and Jin Hua (Golden Flower) watched the melee from safety—a spectacular battle of brute strength versus numbers. By nightfall, the horned beasts had reclaimed their land, though littered with casualties. Over thirty crocodiles and a hundred horned creatures lay dead.

Exhausted, both sides withdrew. The horned beasts’ white-furred leader emitted a final ear-splitting yowl before its pack dragged away crocodile carcasses, vanishing into the forest.

“Gone?” Guan Yu muttered, perplexed.

“They’ve retreated to feast,” Jin Hua (Golden Flower) observed.

“We should move deeper. Find a safer rest spot before dark.”

They traveled treetop until discovering a massive, withered tree—its bark stripped bare by time. Despite Jin Hua’s (Golden Flower) concerns about visibility, Guan Yu deemed it secure. Setting up their new tent, they rested through an uneventful night.

At dawn, they resumed their urgent quest: locating Jin Hua’s (Golden Flower) father, Uncle Qing, within the narrowing window of ten days. Skirting beast territories, they pressed onward, seeking any trace of human presence in the untamed wilds.

Two days into their search, frustration mounted. “This forest is endless,” Guan Yu sighed. “What if he isn’t here?”

Jin Hua (Golden Flower) shook her head. “We’ll find clues. We must.”

Their journey continued—alternating between swift aerial travel and cautious ground progress, ever vigilant against the forest’s dangers. Time slipped away like sand through fingers, each sunset heightening their urgency.
