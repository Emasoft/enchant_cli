“Can’t I just chat with you for no reason?” Fu Linlin retorted petulantly with a pout.

Guan Yu pursed his lips and remained silent.

Seeing Guan Yu’s continued silence and indifference, Fu Linlin stomped her foot in frustration. “I came to ask you—Xiaojuan hasn’t returned to school for two days. At noon the day before yesterday, she called our dorm sisters and said you should go find her…”

“Me? Where?” Guan Yu turned his head in puzzlement, his tone skeptical.

Fu Linlin’s anger flared further at his sudden alertness. She had initiated the conversation only to be met with coldness, yet the mere mention of that naive Du Xiaojuan had him instantly attentive. The unfairness gnawed at her.

With a huff, she banged her tableware against the sink. “I don’t know! I’ve told you what I needed to. I’m leaving!” She spun around and stormed off, resentment simmering.

Guan Yu watched her go impassively. So Du Xiaojuan had vanished after her father’s call. Where could he even search for her?

Pocketing his cleaned utensils, he strolled out of the cafeteria while dialing her number.

No answer.

Strange. He scratched his head. He’d try again tonight. Without knowing her aunt’s address or family background, how could he track her down? And why had she asked her roommates to summon him? Shaking off the confusion, he headed toward his dorm.

His phone rang moments later.

“Guan Yu, why didn’t you come for lunch?” Liu Shilei’s voice floated through as she sat on her bed, watching Mo Ling wash dishes.

“Ah, I ate with my dorm brothers. Didn’t want to explain things to them…” he replied casually.

“Are you free this afternoon? Come visit me during the break?”

“Well…” He hesitated. Frequent visits to the female teachers’ dorm might spark rumors.

“What’s wrong?”

“Nothing. I’ll come now.” Hanging up, he chuckled at his own reservations. If Shilei didn’t care about gossip, why should he?

Entering her dorm, he found Liu Shilei reading a magazine beside washed apples. “Shilei-jie, I’m here,” he announced, finding the door ajar.

“Sit…” She glanced up with a soft smile.

Leaning back playfully, he teased, “Miss me already? Should I lock the door so we can—”

“Stop it! Mo Ling will return any moment!” she chided, feigning sternness.

Grinning, he settled into a chair.

Setting aside her magazine, Liu Shilei grew serious. “With the new semester starting, focus on studies. My former classmate’s film crew will arrive soon—I could arrange a weekend job for you. Better than skipping classes to earn money.”

Guan Yu blinked. A part-time job? With nearly a million yuan from recent ventures, he hardly needed petty cash.

Noticing his frown, Liu Shilei softened. “If you’re short, I can lend—”

“I—”

“I know you’d refuse. Repay me later… or support me someday.” She tactfully spared his pride.

He burst into laughter. “Why wait? Let me spoil you now! Quit teaching and be my lady of leisure.”

“Be serious! Skipping classes isn’t sustainable. You can’t—”

“Alright, alright!” He cut her off ruefully. Did he truly appear so destitute?

Their banter paused as Mo Ling returned. The once-fiery girl now moved quietly, offering a nod before retreating to her room. Both noted her subdued demeanor but said nothing.

Closing the door, Guan Yu sidled closer. “Did you miss me?”

“I’d sooner be rid of you!” she retorted, yet pulled him into an embrace.

“Then why hold me?” He feigned hurt before capturing her lips.

“Not so fast. Peel me an apple first.”

As his thumb brushed the damp fruit, a warm current surged through his hand—gone before he could grasp it. The apple, now tasteless pulp, confirmed his suspicion: the copper coin’s energy absorption had evolved beyond oral consumption.

Testing further with sugar, he watched granules vanish beneath wet fingers. This method proved exponentially faster than eating sweets. Excitement surged—he could now replenish energy effortlessly!

Begging leave from a exasperated Liu Shilei, he raced to experiment with bulk sugar purchases. Sitting in a grubby pavilion, he channeled torrents of sweetness into the ravenous coin, its golden glow intensifying with each absorption.

Heart pounding, he headed to the hospital. With this breakthrough, curing Luo’s mother seemed within reach.

“Brother Guan? What brings you back?” Luo Cheng greeted in the corridor.

“Just checking on your mother.” Guan Yu strode into the ward, energy thrumming in his veins. The final treatment awaited.
