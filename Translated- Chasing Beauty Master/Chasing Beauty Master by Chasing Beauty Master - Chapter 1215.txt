“I just finished speaking when Elder Lu walked in from outside the courtyard. From afar, the aroma of meat mingled with the scent of wine wafted through the air.

Upon seeing Guan Yu, Elder Lu chuckled, “Ah, Guan Yu! I never imagined this delightful fragrance was coming from you. I thought it was the kitchen out back! This roasted meat truly makes one’s mouth water.”

Guan Yu stood and clasped his hands respectfully. “Elder Lu, you’ve come so early? Unfortunately, the meat is nearly gone—no luck there. But there’s still some wine left. Why not join us for a few cups?”

“No need. We’ll have plenty of time later,” Elder Lu replied with a smile. “I came to inform you that the Sect Leader summoned me at dawn. He’s waiting for you in the main hall right now.”

“So early?” Guan Yu sighed. “Elder Xuan must be quite impatient.” Turning to his companion, he added, “Brother Jinci, let’s drink another time. You’ve been up all night—go rest.”

Second Only to Wolf rose and nodded gratefully to Elder Lu. “Thank you for sharing your fine wine through the night. I’m indebted.” With that, he retreated to his quarters.

“Elder Lu, I’ll freshen up quickly and meet you shortly,” Guan Yu said.

“Hurry along then,” Elder Lu urged. “The Sect Leader and I will be waiting.”

After a swift wash and change of clothes, Guan Yu arrived at the main hall to find Xuan Ming and Elder Lu embroiled in a heated argument, faces flushed with agitation.

Bowing slightly, Guan Yu inquired, “What has upset you both so?”

Xuan Ming thrust forward an iron folding fan radiating faint golden light. “Look at this treasure! Yet Elder Lu dares call it trash! Insufferable!”

The half-meter-long metallic fan appeared cumbersome, though its shimmering aura hinted at hidden power. Xuan Ming stroked it proudly while Elder Lu scoffed, “That clunky metal contraption? True artifacts aren’t measured by weight! Heavy tools drain cultivators’ energy—we refine spiritual power, not brute strength!”

“You understand nothing!” Xuan Ming retorted. “An artifact’s worth lies in its energy capacity and materials! This fan stores tremendous power—a cultivator’s greatest asset!”

Elder Lu snorted. “I see no rare materials here. This was clearly forged by some mediocre craftsman.”

“Nonsense! I obtained this from an ancient battlefield years ago! Its aura alone proves it’s a masterwork!” Xuan Ming shot back.

Guan Yu watched awkwardly, realizing their quarrel stemmed from competing to gift him artifacts.

“You call this treasure?” Elder Lu pressed. “Four years just to erase the previous owner’s imprint? True superior artifacts choose their masters—no need for such tedious purification!”

Though stung by the criticism, Xuan Ming knew Elder Lu spoke truth—genuine top-tier artifacts were vanishingly rare. Masterpieces recognized their wielders instinctively, bonding irrevocably until death.

“Enough!” Xuan Ming challenged. “Show me your so-called superior artifact!”

With a flourish, Elder Lu produced a writhing blue-glowing rope resembling a living serpent. “Behold the Toad Skin Autumn Rope! Found decades past when I encountered a千年蟾母 (Millennium Toad Matriarch) during my travels. Though fearsome, she gifted this upon departing—far more practical than that unwieldy fan!”

Xuan Ming sneered, “A glorified belt? Hardly impressive!”

“Appearances deceive!” Elder Lu countered. “This stores immense energy, conceals easily, and aids mobility—unlike your cumbersome fan!”

As their debate intensified, Xuan Ming suddenly revealed a miniature golden pagoda spinning in his palm. “This Eight Treasures Pagoda is no mere artifact—it’s an immortal-grade treasure! Capable of storing entire spells for instant release!”

Elder Lu’s eyes narrowed at the precious relic. “Don’t inflate its worth! While potent, it’s merely an ancient relic—not true仙器 (Immortal Artifact)! True celestial tools store multiple grand spells, not single minor tricks!”

Guan Yu observed silently, masking his excitement. Let them debate—the longer they vied for his favor, the better his eventual choice would be.

“Enlighten him, Elder Lu,” Xuan Ming growled. “Explain artifacts versus immortal tools.”

“Gladly,” Elder Lu began. “Artifacts assist spellcasting by storing spiritual energy. Immortal tools transcend this—they preserve pre-cast spells for immediate use. However, genuine仙器 are mythically rare. What Xuan Ming holds is merely an advanced artifact.”

“Semantics!” Xuan Ming snapped. “This pagoda’s power remains unmatched!”

Guan Yu smiled inwardly. The competition was just beginning—and he intended to reap its full rewards.
