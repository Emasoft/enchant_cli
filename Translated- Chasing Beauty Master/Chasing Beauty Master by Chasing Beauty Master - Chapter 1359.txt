“That’s a special case. Who knows how they cultivated? Though the Demon Sect has many factions, their cultivation laws all stem from the Demon Soul Sect’s severed lineage. As for why they’ve developed distinct practices—it’s all due to their own comprehension.”

Wang Xiaorong studied the expression on Guan Yu’s face, trying to discern what he was thinking. After a while, she realized his features remained impassive, as if none of this concerned him.

“Well, that’s… fortunate,” Xiao Zhi said, exhaling as though relieved—yet with a tinge of reluctance. “If the Left Envoy truly possesses a method to dismantle the traps, I suppose we needn’t enter. Even if we did, we’d surely perish either by the mechanisms or the Demon Sect’s hands. Let’s abandon this folly.”

Siqi retorted solemnly, “We’ve received our master’s orders. How can we retreat so easily? Xiao Zhi, I demand you cease these cowardly thoughts. Though we’re few and no match for the Demon Sect, we must secure the Eight-Drum Technique. We cannot let those heretics claim it first. Our mission is sacred!”

While the others somewhat understood Xiao Zhi’s reasoning, Wang Xiaorong stared at Siqi as if addressing an imbecile. “Sacred mission? You’d charge into certain death? Knowing you’re outmatched yet still rushing in—knowing it’s a pit of fire yet still leaping in? Are you deranged?”

“Wang Xiaorong!” Xiao Zhi snapped, pointing angrily. “Watch your tongue! This doesn’t concern you!”

“Oh ho! Your precious junior sister is quite the charmer, isn’t she?” Wang Xiaorong sneered, slanting a glance at Guan Yu. “Too delicate to criticize, always shielded by her knights. How… remarkable.”

As Siqi’s fury threatened to erupt, Guan Yu intervened calmly, “Enough squabbling. Save your energy for strategizing. Arguing won’t solve anything.”

His words subtly favored Siqi, signaling his intent to proceed. Xiao Zhi pressed, “Guan Yu, the disparity in strength is obvious. Is this risk truly worth it? Returning to report the truth to our sect—surely the elders would understand!”

“Understand? Ha!” Wang Xiaorong scoffed, tilting her chin. “Those old fogies of your Cloud Azure Sect are all self-serving wretches. Return empty-handed, and expulsion would be the least of your worries. They’d cast you out like trash!”

Given the Demon Soul Sect’s extensive spies within Cloud Azure, her insight held weight.

“I warn you again—stop slandering our sect!” Xiao Zhi roared.

“Who knows what brainwashing those elders inflicted?” Wang Xiaorong muttered. “Turned you all into mindless sheep…”

Guan Yu privately agreed but stayed silent. Cloud Azure had clearly known of the Demon Sect’s movements yet sent no reinforcements. Now, outnumbered and intruding into the enemy’s ancestral ground—this was folly.

Logic declared their chances nil. Claiming the Eight-Drum Technique? A fantasy.

At Echo Pavilion, business thrived as usual. Wealthy patrons flocked to this premier diversion in Qujiang City. Over the past year, it had become a hub for scholars, gamblers, and officials alike—though how much “studying” occurred remained questionable.

Reclining on a divan, West Willow stirred as a middle-aged matron entered. “Madam, the Demon Soul Sect has mobilized. They’ve likely departed.”

“Good. Rally our people—we move shortly,” West Willow ordered, rising swiftly.

After the woman left, West Peach Blossom inquired, “Is this intelligence reliable?”

“Without doubt. I saw the Azure Dragon Left Envoy himself disguised at the Qin Manor today. The entrance to Duobao Mountain lies in their rear garden.”

Though their informant in the Qin household was unreliable, West Willow’s own reconnaissance confirmed the Demon Soul Sect’s gathering.

“Should we send more forces?” West Peach Blossom asked.

“No. We’re here to plunder, not brawl. Avoid direct conflict—follow their trail. Select our cleverest sisters. We depart now.”

At the Qin Manor, thirty Demon Soul Sect members vanished through a假山 entrance. Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s group lingered in deliberation.

“Guan Yu, let’s consult our masters again,” Aze urged, fear palpable. Unlike Siqi’s blind devotion, he and Xiao Zhi saw the suicidal odds.

Siqi glared. “Since when did cowardice stain Cloud Azure’s disciples? I’d rather die honorably than slink back disgraced!”

Wang Xiaorong tittered. “Oh dear, your heroism crumbles before her eyes…”

“Enough!” Xiao Zhi barked. “This isn’t cowardice—it’s pragmatism! Thirty enemies, unknown traps… What hope have we?”

“Then perish with dignity!” Siqi retorted coldly.

As tensions peaked, Guan Yu stood. “We go. Duobao Mountain promises more than the Eight-Drum Technique—a millennium’s secrets await. Stay hidden, let their numbers thin against the traps. What can two mangy foxes and a Left Envoy do against us then?”

His aura radiated command, stirring reluctant awe. Secretly, he relied on two hidden artifacts—insurance against disaster.

“Guan Yu’s right!” Wang Xiaorong chirped, starry-eyed. “I’ll protect you all!”

“With you as hostage, the Left Envoy wouldn’t dare strike,” Guan Yu teased.

She pouted. “Using me as a shield? How cruel!”

“But effective,” he countered. “Your presence guarantees safe passage.”

Reluctantly, the others agreed. With Wang Xiaorong’s safeguard and Guan Yu’s artifacts, perhaps survival was possible.

As Guan Yu peered outside, moonlight revealed figures on the opposite roof. “Quiet! We’re watched.”

The group froze. Wang Xiaorong perched on Guan Yu’s shoulders for a better view. “Demon Soul sentries?”

“Unlikely,” Guan Yu murmured. “They’ve all entered. These are women—likely West Willow’s Fox Demon Cave faction.”

“How?!” Wang Xiaorong gasped. “Did you inform them?!”

“Don’t be absurd. Your Sect’s massacre at the Qin Manor drew attention. West Willow’s no fool—she sniffed this out herself.”

Indeed, West Willow’s Fox Demon Cave proved more formidable than perceived. Their discreet power now shadowed the Demon Soul Sect’s wake—a new variable in the deadly game.

Though Siqi advocated blind obedience, Guan Yu’s plan kindled reluctant hope. Even Xiao Zhi felt stirrings of adventure. “Follow at a distance… let them bleed first…”

“Exactly,” Guan Yu grinned. “We’ll be scavengers feasting after the lions.”

Wang Xiaorong clapped. “Ooh, like those bandits in *Water Margin*! Sneaky but smart!”

As moonlit conspiracies unfolded, none noticed the true danger—not from mechanisms or sects, but from ambitions clashing in the mountain’s ancient heart. Tonight’s shadows concealed more than secrets; they veiled the unraveling of destinies.
