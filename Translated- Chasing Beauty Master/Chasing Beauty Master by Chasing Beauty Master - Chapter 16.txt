“You…” Du Xiaojuan (Little Dawn) raised her head hesitantly, her eyes filled with uncertainty and panic as she looked at Guan Yu. Flushed to the point of tears, her delicate appearance stirred profound tenderness.

Since childhood, when had any boy ever touched her bottom? Though accidental, the incident left her utterly flustered.

Withdrawing his left hand, Guan Yu secretly clenched his fist. Dammit, what were the odds of slipping into such tightly fastened waistband? Pure misfortune...

After enduring the crowded ride, Guan Yu finally pulled Du Xiaojuan’s arm through the throng to disembark.

“Huff… Never taking the bus again! It’s unbearable!” Du Xiaojuan reddened, pretending nonchalance as she glared at the departing vehicle.

“Yeah… too crowded! The driver was rude too,” Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly.

The bustling flower and bird market brimmed with life. As they wandered past goldfish and squirrel vendors, a man sat leisurely on a stool, engrossed in a novel. Before him lay several orchid pots past their bloom, identifiable only by photos displayed at their bases.

Having no expertise in rare flora, Guan Yu stood with hands clasped behind his back, observing Du Xiaojuan’s crouched figure as she browsed.

Her hips arched enticingly, the stretch of her capris accentuating every curve. As she bent lower, the waistband slipped slightly, revealing the edge of her ecru underwear. Clearing his throat, Guan Yu tugged her shirt hem to cover the exposed sliver of pale skin.

Glancing back in confusion, Du Xiaojuan touched her waistband and blushed. Shooting him a sidelong look, she pulled him down beside her. “Help me choose. Which is better?”

Utterly clueless about orchids, Guan Yu feigned scrutiny before blinking helplessly. “You pick. I’ll advise.”

The vendor studied them before setting his novel aside. Leaning forward, he addressed Du Xiaojuan: “Looking for orchids, young miss?”

“Just browsing. Got any premium varieties?”

“Certainly! These are excellent. You seem refined enough to appreciate orchids – the gentleman among flowers. Most can’t comprehend their elegance.”

Du Xiaojuan smiled bashfully under the praise, glancing skeptically at Guan Yu. He shrugged – seeking his opinion on this subject was futile.

Chapter 37: The Prodigy

Seeing her indecision, Guan Yu addressed the vendor coolly: “We need a birthday gift for elders. Recommend something.”

“Ah, for seniors! What price range?”

“Cost isn’t important. We want something rare and exquisite,” Du Xiaojuan interjected brightly.

Guan Yu winced inwardly. Vendors loved customers who didn’t haggle.

The vendor’s enthusiasm surged. He produced an orchid pot triumphantly: “This Phalaenopsis is a national treasure! See these butterfly-like speckles? A peerless rarity! Nanjing won’t have another like it!”

“So precious?” Du Xiaojuan’s eyes sparkled at the unbloomed plant’s patterned leaves.

“This Phalaenopsis with butterfly-marked leaves is my shop’s treasure!” the vendor boasted.

Guan Yu nearly scoffed aloud. “Treasure” in this open-air stall?

As they settled on 4,300 yuan, Guan Yu noticed the vendor’s barely concealed excitement. Why such glee over 200 yuan profit?

Suddenly remembering his detection system, Guan Yu halted the transaction. Scanning the orchid and vendor’s mind, he smirked.

“Unethical, sir. This isn’t Phalaenopsis but Jianyang Butterfly – chemically treated for three days to mimic rare patterns. True Phalaenopsis wouldn’t show such artificial speckling.”

The vendor paled. “Nonsense! This companion multi-petal orchid proves—”

“That dyed impostor?” Guan Yu cut him off. “No fragrance. Let me rub the petals – the color will bleed. Your ‘rare orchid’ is alcohol-bleached, and that glued multi-petal fraud—”

“Enough!” The vendor raised trembling hands. “Experts playing ignorant? I’m just trying to eat! Take me to buy real ones!”

After exposing several more fakes, the chastened vendor led them to another stall. Guan Yu’s detection confirmed an authentic Cymbidium. When haggling commenced, he stunned the new vendor by precisely quoting acquisition costs and profit margins.

“3,600 yuan. You’ll still make 300 profit from two days’ ownership.”

The florist gaped before waving them off like plague carriers. “Take it! Just go!”

Chapter 38: Pet System Activation

Emerging victorious, Du Xiaojuan nudged Guan Yu playfully. “Little junior, you’re wicked! An orchid expert pretending ignorance!”

“Expert?” Guan Yu eyed her mischievously. “The only flower I appreciate is a pure lily like you, waiting to bloom—”

“Rogue!” She flushed crimson, glaring through her embarrassment.

As they explored the market, Du Xiaojuan’s repeated sighs prompted Guan Yu’s inquiry. “What’s wrong?”

“Bought the flower too early. It’s heavy!”

“Let me carry it.” He relented under her pitiful look.

“Finally! Where’s your gentlemanly awareness?” she chided instantly, beaming as he took the load.

“You could’ve asked earlier,” he grumbled.

“Blockhead!” She linked arms with him. “Let’s see the birds!”

Strutting past envious stares with a beauty on his arm, Guan Yu fantasized about future riches – a entourage of beauties attending his every need. His daydream shattered upon witnessing a man exchange stacks of cash for a pigeon.

“Fifty万 for that bird?” Guan Yu marveled. Activating his detection system, he assessed the pigeons’ flight scores. The priciest specimen scored 200+ – far beyond others’ 80s.

As he imagined breeding champion racers, golden light flashed in his mind. The copper coin symbol reappeared with a notification:

[Pet System Activated. Primary Level: Communicate/control limited animals. Loyalty determines duration.]

Stunned, Guan Yu gaped. Was this an RPG? Taming pets? This defied all logic!
