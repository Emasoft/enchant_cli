The event was extraordinarily grand, with a massive crowd of onlookers, local hoodlums, and gang members packed densely before the storefront. A previously unknown young man suddenly emerged into public view, and in an instant, Guan Yu (Universe)’s name resounded thunderously across both the legal and underworld spheres of Nanjing.

**Chapter 240: Even More Beautiful in a Skirt and Stockings**

After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Guan Yu personally arranged for the numerous influential figures to attend a hastily organized banquet.

Since the celebratory feast at the newly opened store hadn’t accounted for these dignitaries, there were initially no seats prepared for them. Moreover, such guests couldn’t be casually entertained in such a setting. Fortunately, Feng Xin (Joyful) had contacts with managers of several five-star hotels in the city. A single phone call later, everything was impeccably arranged.

At the banquet, Guan Yu toasted each guest individually, exchanging pleasantries with the assembled magnates. Two tables were set: one occupied entirely by high-ranking officials pivotal to the political arena, and the other, barely a meter away, seated the titans of Nanjing’s underworld.

For Guan Yu, this was a masterclass in diplomacy!

These seasoned socialites and powerbrokers all possessed formidable drinking prowess. Taking turns to clink glasses with Guan Yu, they initially doubted he could endure multiple rounds. Yet, to their astonishment, he downed three-ounce cups of liquor one after another without flinching. Every challenge was met with a raised cup and a swift, fearless gulp.

In the blink of an eye, six bottles of Wuliangye were emptied. Guan Yu alone had consumed over three pounds of liquor.

Three pounds of baijiu—yet his face remained unflushed, his breathing steady. The crowd stared at him as if witnessing a specter, their expressions brimming with disbelief.

Even three pounds of water would bloat one’s stomach, yet Guan Yu remained perfectly composed, chatting and laughing as if untouched.

The real shock came later.

In Chinese culture, bonding over banquets is customary. Matters discussed after drinks invariably proceed with unnatural smoothness. After several more rounds, observant guests estimated Guan Yu had imbibed five to six bottles—six pounds of liquor!

Such capacity surpassed even the legends of wine gods and immortals!

Though the alcohol flowed freely, Guan Yu’s healing technique—unexpectedly effective at neutralizing intoxication—activated seamlessly. Originally requiring a thirty-minute cooldown, the golden coin in his mind now vibrated eagerly at his command, voraciously absorbing every trace of alcohol.

*This damned coin’s a drunkard itself!* Guan Yu grumbled inwardly after repeated trials.

Yet the benefit was undeniable: the liquor’s energy far surpassed that of pounds of sugar, leaving the coin’s reserves brimming.

As the banquet concluded, most guests staggered out tipsily. Despite their usual restraint, Guan Yu’s relentless toasting had felled over half the crowd, requiring support from drivers and subordinates.

Old Man Liu, flushed but beaming, patted Guan Yu’s hand approvingly. “Impressive! A real man can’t call himself one without holding his liquor. But your capacity is downright terrifying!”

“Terrifying? We’re just baffled where all that wine goes!” slurred Old Man Feng, dragging a chair over unsteadily.

“Scram! Must you plague me even now?” Old Man Liu snapped irritably.

“Still putting on airs? We’re all retirees nearing our coffins! Remember—when you meet Yama, it’ll be four against one!” Old Man Feng retorted with a sly grin.

As the elders bickered, Guan Yu slipped away to join Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan (Dawn Beauty), who had been whispering conspiratorially since the meal began.

“Why’d you come over? Go mediate before they argue!” Feng Xin said coolly, glancing up.

“They’re just venting. Better not get involved. What’re you two discussing?” Guan Yu propped his chin on his hands, smiling.

“Women’s talk. None of your business,” Feng Xin retorted, rolling her eyes.

Du Xiaojuan, however, giggled and patted Guan Yu’s thigh under the table, her eyes sparkling mischievously.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. *This tomboy’s never shown an ounce of tenderness.* His gaze drifted over Feng Xin’s attire—eternal pantsuit, flat black shoes.

“What?” she demanded coldly, noticing his appraisal.

“Just thinking you’d stun the world in a skirt, stockings, and heels. Why stay so buttoned-up?” he teased.

Du Xiaojuan tilted her head, studying Feng Xin, then nodded in agreement.

“Buzz off! I dress for myself, not you!” Feng Xin shot back, glaring.

With a shrug, Guan Yu retreated.

Once he left, Feng Xin bit her lip, glanced at her outfit, and hesitantly asked Du Xiaojuan, “Do I… really look that frumpy?”

**Chapter 241: Does the Tomboy Blush?**

Du Xiaojuan blinked innocently. “You’re already gorgeous! But Guan Yu’s right—a more feminine style would be devastating!”

Though initially wary of Feng Xin, Du Xiaojuan couldn’t deny her flawless beauty.

Feng Xin fell silent, then abruptly invited, “Want to go shopping?”

“Oh! I should ask Guan Yu first…”

Hours later, after farewells, Guan Yu finally relaxed. Luo Cheng (Achievement), ecstatic, bounded over. “Boss! Today was legendary! Our name’s made!”

“Stay grounded. This is just the start,” Guan Yu cautioned, though smiling.

Meanwhile, Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan wandered a mall. After thirty minutes of trying on cartoon-emblazoned shirts, Feng Xin sighed. “These feel… wrong.”

“But they’re adorable!” Du Xiaojuan protested.

“You keep them. I’ll stick to my style.”

*Why did I think a child’s taste would help?* Feng Xin lamented inwardly.

Returning Du Xiaojuan home, Feng Xin hesitated at the threshold of her villa—*their* home. Inside, she encountered Guan Yu post-shower, shirtless, towel-drying his hair.

Her heart raced as she averted her eyes. When he offered a drink, she startled, flushing crimson upon meeting his gaze.

“You okay?” Guan Yu leaned closer, his scent disarming her.

“N-nothing!” she stammered, fleeing hastily.

Alone in her car, she fanned her burning cheeks. *Acting like a schoolgirl!*

Back inside, Du Xiaojuan mused, “What was wrong with her?”

“No idea,” Guan Yu shrugged. “What did you two discuss earlier?”

“She’s nice! I didn’t know she’s your senior!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Rest tomorrow. We return to campus Monday. Consider moving here—your roommates…”

“They’re kind!” Du Xiaojuan insisted.

“Your choice,” he conceded, dreading another confrontation—with Liu Shilei.

**Chapter 242: Return to Campus**

Observing Feng Xin’s uncharacteristic shyness, Guan Yu felt an unexpected stir. The tomboy’s blushing delicacy was disarmingly charming.

But under his gaze, Feng Xin only reddened further. “I’m leaving!” she snapped, bolting.

Alone, she berated herself in the rearview mirror. *Thirty years old and flustered like a teen!*

Meanwhile, Guan Yu pondered campus life’s complications—and how Liu Shilei would react to his entanglement with Du Xiaojuan.
