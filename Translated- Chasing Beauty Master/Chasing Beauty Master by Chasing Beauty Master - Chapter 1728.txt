“So this is your fault. How could you be so certain that the chieftain and others were captured by the Jia Yi Sect? Clearly, you already knew about this.” Mazhagen (Firmly Rooted) spoke calmly, his words piercing straight through Hadabei’s (Northern Virtue) facade.

Indeed, Hadabei had been too certain about the chieftain’s capture. Under normal circumstances, one might consider possibilities like the chieftain leading an escape or going into hiding. Yet Hadabei had declared their capture before verifying these alternatives—a glaring inconsistency.

Hadabei, his conscience guilty, had been exposed by this sudden confrontation. He sneered, “Fine. Since you don’t trust me, I’ll leave. But I swear I had no part in the Jia Yi Sect’s attack on the Ha Clan. Believe it or not.”

With that, Hadabei turned and left. Unwelcome here, he had no choice but to return to the Jia Yi Sect. Frustration gnawed at him—he’d hoped to gather intelligence on secret techniques but now faced suspicion, forced back to the sect’s clutches.

After Hadabei’s departure, Mazhagen wasted no time. Despite the night’s darkness, he trailed the man from a distance, determined to uncover the sect’s location. If Hadabei led him there, they could plan a rescue mission for the chieftain when the time was ripe.

Meanwhile, Guanyu and his companions spent several days recuperating with the Bruu Clan. They assisted in rebuilding efforts—burying the dead, erecting new tents. Of the Bruu’s remaining fifty survivors, most were women; the few surviving men bore grave injuries.

“These past days, your help has been invaluable,” the Bruu chieftain said during an evening feast. “You’ve restored our hope. We are deeply grateful.”

Guanyu bowed. “We only did what was right. Thank you for your hospitality.”

Wang Jun added encouragingly, “Though wounded, the Bruu will thrive again under your leadership, Chieftain.”

The chieftain sighed. “Your presence revived my spirit. Without allies, I’d have lost heart.”

As they prepared to depart the next day, Guanyu broached their true purpose: “Chieftain, we seek a place called苗城 (Miao City) in these deserts. Have you heard of it?”

“You hunt the Eight-Sided Drum Technique,” the chieftain deduced. At Guanyu’s nod, he continued, “Many martial artists come now, for苗城 is said to appear only on July 15th. Yet its manifestation isn’t guaranteed yearly—certain conditions must align.”

Guanyu frowned. “So even on that date, it might not emerge?”

“Exactly.苗城 belongs not to this realm. Its appearance demands specific triggers.”

Aze interjected anxiously, “What triggers? Without signs, we risk wasting months!”

The chieftain spread his hands. “Our peaceful clan never pursued such mysteries. But know this: when苗城 last appeared, the Jia Yi Sect sent hundreds inside. None returned.”

Wang Jun paled. “If hundreds perished, what hope have we twenty-odd?”

“Patience,” Guanyu counseled. “First, we locate苗城. The Jia Yi Sect’s leader supposedly senses its emergence. We’ll seek her methods.”

“That demonic cult?” Wang Jun protested. “They’ll attack on sight!”

“We’ll force cooperation through strength,” Guanyu countered. “Allying with the Ha Clan against them gives us shields and favors owed.”

Their plans shifted when news arrived—the Ha Clan too had fallen to the Jia Yi Sect. Remembering Mazhagen’s ties to the Ha, Guanyu insisted on investigating, despite Wang Jun’s complaints about backtracking.

“Helping the Ha weakens our enemies and gains intelligence,” Guanyu reasoned. “Would you rather wander deserts forever?”

——

Unbeknownst to Hadabei, Mazhagen stalked him to the Jia Yi Sect’s new encampment—a sprawling tent city. Mazhagen’s bulk made stealth impossible, but he identified a large central tent likely holding prisoners.

As he infiltrated, guards raised alarms. “Assassin! Surround him!”

Chaos erupted. In the commotion, Ha prisoners escaped—though most were recaptured. Enraged, the sect’s leader confronted Hadabei in her chambers.

“You led them here!” she accused, plunging a dagger into his heart. “Useless traitor.”

Dying, Hadabei gasped a revelation to Mazhagen: “The leader... she’s Xiaomei (Enchantress)!”

Mazhagen reeled. Xiaomei—once his beloved—had orchestrated this carnage. Months earlier, she’d infiltrated the Ha Clan, seducing secrets of their strength-extending秘籍 (secret manual). Failing that, she’d manipulated Hadabei into betrayal, all to bolster her chances in苗城’s lethal depths.

Now, with July 15th approaching, Xiaomei’s true face emerged—a viper masked as a lover, willing to bathe clans in blood for power. As Mazhagen fled with this truth, Guanyu’s group approached the Ha ruins, unaware their paths would soon collide with both a vengeful giant and a serpentine foe poised to drown the desert in fresh blood.
