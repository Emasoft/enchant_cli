Witnessing Locke’s smug expression of petty triumph, Guan Yu’s heart seethed with resentment. Yet powerless to confront him physically, he suddenly furrowed his brows as a cunning plan dawned. Feigning despair, he wailed, “Locke, is it too late for me to reconsider?”

Locke stiffened at Guan Yu’s words, baffled by this abrupt shift. *This stubborn fool who earlier clung to defiance like a boiled duck—how could he capitulate so swiftly now?* he inwardly mused.

“In the end, I overstepped,” Guan Yu continued, his voice laden with theatrical remorse. “This was always an internal affair of your elven kin. As a mere human, I’ve no right to meddle. If I continue opposing you, I’ll lose my life for nothing!”

Locke nodded, a booming laugh erupting from his chest. “A wise man bows to circumstance! Your repentance arrives just in time. Hand over the Crystal Toad, and I’ll spare your miserable hide!”

Noting Locke’s lowered guard, Guan Yu concealed his glee beneath a mask of anguish. “Ah… about that…” He spread his palms helplessly. “When you struck me earlier, the toad slipped from my grasp. Who knows where it fell?”

Locke’s jovial demeanor shattered like glass. Blood drained from his face as he hissed, “You dare mock me, whelp?”

“I speak truth!” Guan Yu protested, clutching his chest dramatically. “Your blow nearly killed me—its force was monstrous!”

A mirthless chuckle escaped Locke. “You should omit the word ‘nearly,’ fool.”

“But you vowed not to kill me!” Guan Yu cried in feigned panic.

“Without the Crystal Toad, you’re worthless!” Roaring, Locke began channeling elemental energy. But Guan Yu had anticipated this—the instant swirling energies coalesced around Locke’s hands, he bellowed, “Gather Qi into Blades!”

A blade of indigo energy materialized, streaking toward Locke’s heart. Abandoning his spell, Locke twisted aside—but proximity betrayed him. The spectral edge gashed his shoulder, sending an arterial spray painting the air.

Already propelled backward by the attack’s recoil, Guan Yu hovered momentarily above the chasm’s maw. Grinning savagely at his foe, he called “Farewell!” and plunged into the abyss.

The crowd surged to the cliff’s edge, peering through roiling mists that obscured all but endless depth. “No one survives that fall,” someone muttered.

“That vermin’s final act was to wound me!” Locke snarled, clamping a bloodied hand over his injury. Remembering Guan Yu’s claim about the toad’s loss, he wheeled toward the hillside. “Search every crevice! Falsehood or not, it’s our only lead!”

As the throng dispersed, one figure lingered—Xia Yue’er, her gaze fixed on the void where Guan Yu vanished. “Brother Yu,” she whispered, “why did you flee toward this cursed cliff? I never warned you… Now who’ll play with me? Those villains—I’ll tell Father! He’ll avenge you!”

“Miss Yue’er, we must depart.” A deep voice interrupted her vigil. Behind her stood Ma Shaoyi, lieutenant of the Black Dragon Mercenary Group, flanked by eight hulking warriors.

Ignoring them, Yue’er stared into the abyss. “Uncle Ma… Could Brother Yu still live?”

**Chapter 1279: Vengeance for Brother Yu**

Ma Shaoyi blinked. “Brother Yu? The boy who jumped?”

Yue’er nodded. “He was my friend.”

The lieutenant frowned. Headstrong and eccentric, the clan leader’s daughter seldom befriended outsiders. What alchemy had bound her to this youth? More crucially—how had he convinced her to help steal the Crystal Toad?

Their musings shattered as searchers returned, a black-clad man brandishing a luminous mirror. “That’s mine!” Yue’er lunged for it.

The man retreated, snarling, “Yours? Had you not interfered, the toad wouldn’t be lost!”

Yue’er’s delicate features hardened. “Return it! Your incompetence cost the toad—don’t blame me for your shame!”

The retort stunned the assembly. As angry murmurs swelled, Yue’er turned to Ma Shaoyi. “Uncle! They bully me!”

The black-clad man addressed Ma. “Song Wenxing of Qingzhao City’s Song Martial Hall. And you are…?”

Ma’s lip curled. “Song Martial Hall? Never heard of it.”

Song’s face flushed. “Established eight years past. Might I know your esteemed name?”

“Ma Shaoyi. Captain, Yongzhou’s Black Dragon Mercenary Group.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Though none present had seen these shadows of the Dark Mercenary Alliance—second only to imperial and holy orders—their dread reputation preceded them.

“A thousand pardons, Captain Ma!” The crowd’s demeanor flipped. Song Wenxing trembled—offending the Black Dragon leader’s daughter courted annihilation.

Yue’er sneered at Song’s groveling. “Who permitted ‘Yue’er’? Weren’t you bold earlier? Continue your challenge!”

Her vengeance extended beyond personal slight—this was for Guan Yu. “Kowtow and call me ‘Grandmother,’ or face consequences!”

As Song hesitated, a blade kissed his throat. “Without our reputation to protect,” growled a mercenary, “you’d be carrion.”

Trembling, Song collapsed. Watching his prostration, Yue’er vowed silently: *Brother Yu, alive or dead, I’ll make them pay.*

Sudden applause interrupted. All turned to see a pallid youth in white—Murong Yu, scion of the imperial-aligned Murong clan. “A conference over lost treasures?” he mocked.

**Chapter 1280: Murong Yu**

“Young Master Murong!” sycophants chorused. “Have you come for the toad?”

Murong Yu basked in their fawning while eyeing Yue’er’s group with disdain. Royalists and dark mercenaries shared mutual contempt. “Training dogs, Miss Xia?” he jeered at the prostrate Song.

Yue’er ignored him, whispering to Ma Shaoyi, “Let’s go.”

The lieutenant complied—conflict here risked their mission. As they departed, Murong barked orders: “Scour the mountains! At dawn, search the chasm—bring me the wretch’s corpse!”

Alone with his men, Ma Shaoyi sighed at a subordinate’s question: “Why not kill that arrogant pup?”

“Folly,” Ma replied. “Though I’m a Grandmaster Swordsman, this is Murong territory. Our priority is the toad—not petty squabbles.”

Yue’er interjected with startling acuity: “Four reasons! Their numerical advantage. Our mission’s priority. Avoiding united enemies. And hidden experts among them.”

Ma nodded, adding: “And your safety, young mistress. The Patriarch’s wrath…”

Their laughter at her cheekiness faded as they contemplated explaining the fiasco to their leader.

**Chapter 1281: Dinosaurs?**

Meanwhile, Guan Yu plummeted through screaming winds, face stung by mist. He’d delayed activating his gravity-defying artifact—energy conservation was crucial. “Activate at 100 meters!” his companion金刚 (Jingang) warned.

As weightlessness embraced him, Guan Yu relished the glide—until movement stirred against his chest. The Crystal Toad! Fumbling to secure it disrupted his balance. Frantic corrections came too late—the toad sprang upward, then plummeted like a jade meteor… straight into his gaping mouth.
