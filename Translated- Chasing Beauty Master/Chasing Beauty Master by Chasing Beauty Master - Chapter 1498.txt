“What I wish to hear and what I don't, you should tell me all the same. This matter is settled. Wang Jun, after our affairs here conclude, you shall return with me to the Demon Soul Sect.” Wang Xiaorong declared in a commanding tone.

Wang Jun remained unprepared for this arrangement. Sensing Guan Yu's apparent reluctance, he echoed the sentiment. “Young Mistress, my current position in Cloud Azure Sect remains delicate. If I abruptly follow you to Demon Soul Sect after this mission with Guan Yu, it may cast suspicion upon his circumstances.”

“What harm could there be? You belong to Demon Soul Sect by origin. Is there any impropriety?” Wang Xiaorong pressed. “If Guan Yu cannot keep me company at the sect, shouldn't you at least stay? When days drag like years in Demon Soul Sect, having you recount Guan Yu's tales would bring me comfort.”

“Young Mistress, you misunderstand. My concern lies with Guan Yu's accountability upon returning without me,” Wang Jun explained.

Guan Yu rose, concurring, “Precisely. Wang Jun cannot accompany you this time. I personally requested his assistance for this mission. His sudden departure would invite suspicion upon my return.”

“What trifling concern!” Wang Xiaorong dismissed airily. “If suspicions arise, simply join me at Demon Soul Sect. I'll provide for you till old age. Does this satisfy you?”

Though tempting, Guan Yu's unresolved purposes forbade such retreat. Shaking his head ruefully, he countered, “Matters aren't so simple. While Wang Jun may eventually accompany you, now is impossible.”

Relenting to avoid pressuring Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong conceded, “Very well. After your return, I'll devise means to bring Wang Jun back. Acceptable?”

Wang Jun chuckled nervously. “This hardly seems wise, Young Mistress. I beg your understanding – my position in Cloud Azure Sect remains stable. Moreover, Demon Soul Sect's volatile environment... With my modest cultivation, lacking Guan Yu's capabilities, where lives hang by threads... I've no wish for early demise.”

“What fears? Under my protection in Demon Soul Sect, none shall dare harm you – not even the Demon Sovereign himself!” Wang Xiaorong vowed.

Reassured by her pledge – at least while her affection for Guan Yu endured – Wang Jun yielded. “Very well. After our return, I'll join you whenever Young Mistress commands, provided Guan Yu raises no objection. Though speaking of Qiaoyuan District...”

Guan Yu met his glance. “No matter. I've no secrets to conceal. She'll learn these things eventually regardless.”

“What's this Qiaoyuan District? Is that Guan Yu's homeland?” Wang Xiaorong's curiosity ignited.

Wang Jun observed Guan Yu's unconcerned expression. “My life remains eternally in others' hands. Should mention of Qiaoyuan District provoke displeasure...”

“That's beyond my concern,” Guan Yu interjected with amusement. “Simply guard your tongue.”

“What mysteries do you two share? Explain this Qiaoyuan District at once!”

“It's my home district in City A,” Guan Yu replied. Wang Jun added, “Qiaoyuan District – City A's most affluent enclave. Qiaoyuan Street's villas house the wealthiest elites. Guan Yu's residence contains particularly... intriguing individuals.”

Wang Xiaorong's eyes sparkled. “Your home? How marvelous! So you're wealthy, Guan Yu?”

“Should opportunity arise, let Wang Jun recount such details later,” Guan Yu deflected. “Now – where are Madam Liu and her daughter?”

“Likely still in their chamber. Best not disturb them. We'll arrange their care before departure,” Wang Jun advised, preferring to avoid cumbersome company.

Within their room, Madam Liu and XiaoYuan had awakened earlier but remained discreet. Though ordinary folk, Madam Liu possessed fragmentary knowledge of martial world affairs from her late husband's tales.

Cloud Azure Sect stood as the foremost righteous faction, renowned for charity, while Demon Soul Sect embodied wickedness. This contradicted Guan Yu and Wang Jun's association with demonic cultivators. If Guan Yu were evil, why risk aiding them? Why undertake this arduous journey without sinister intent?

Though perplexed by righteous-disciples consorting with demons, Madam Liu's instincts deemed Guan Yu benevolent. His petitioning of the Governor to investigate Magistrate Pang reinforced this trust.

Yet confusion lingered – why shelter them in demonic territory? Resolving to remain here rather than risk demonic strongholds, Madam Liu contemplated her unattended garden vegetables...

“Wang Jun,” Guan Yu redirected, “Let's procure materials now for seamless return post-mission.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Materials? For crafting purposes?”

“You're well-informed regarding Cloud Azure affairs,” Guan Yu remarked warily.

“My knowledge pales against Father and Left Envoy's,” Wang Xiaorong boasted. “This secret project – known only to you two and Cloud Azure's peak masters – how did Demon Soul Sect learn of it?”

“Walls have ears,” Wang Xiaorong smirked. “Our roots in Cloud Azure run deeper than imagined. Without such foundations, how could Demon Soul Sect rival your sect?”

Guan Yu acknowledged this truth. Among righteous sects – Cloud Azure's Five Peaks, Crimson Lotus Sect, and rising True Sun Sect – only Demon Soul Sect maintained parity through strategic infiltration.

Contemplating unbloodied agents within Cloud Azure's leadership, Guan Yu probed, “Xiaorong, does Cloud Azure harbor Demon Soul Sect peak masters?”

Wang Jun started, astonished by the implication. Wang Xiaorong evaded coyly, “Wouldn't you like to know? The price – accompany me to Demon Soul Sect.”

“Impossible. My duties bind me to Cloud Azure.”

“Father wishes to examine your pistol,” she revealed. “The bullet pendant you crafted fascinates him. Even Right Envoy marveled at its impossible craftsmanship.”

“Our current technology requires millennia to replicate firearms,” Wang Jun noted. “Though crossbows remain feasible.”

“Crossbows?” Wang Xiaorong seized the new term. Guan Yu glared at Wang Jun's loose tongue.

“Something you fear me knowing?” Wang Xiaorong challenged.

“Eventually you'll learn regardless,” Guan Yu conceded. “We procure materials for crossbows – ranged weapons akin to pistols, requiring specialized components.”

Wang Xiaorong's eyes lit with strategic insight. “You plan to arm Cloud Azure with these! But promise me one first, so we may replicate them.”

“Samples come first. Rest assured, yours shall surpass standard models,” Guan Yu bargained, wary of premature proliferation.

“Marvelous! With Cloud Azure's deployment, Demon Soul Sect will inevitably acquire them regardless.”

“Quality varies,” Wang Jun cautioned. “Superior materials create deadlier versions. Guan Yu will craft you an exceptional piece.”

Delighted, Wang Xiaorong pressed, “Our local outpost possesses quality materials. What do you require?”

“Fine timber, steel, animal tendons...” Guan Yu listed.

Wang Xiaorong nodded. “In this mercantile hub, all shall be found.”
