The prince was thoroughly engrossed, clapping enthusiastically as he watched the two performers' dazzling display. Suddenly, the monkey-masked performer glared inward. With a sharp crack, his staff split open to reveal a hidden shortsword.

Now Guan Yu understood why the staff had been crafted so thickly. The monkey-masked man leveled the blade toward Prince Zou while his Bull Demon King counterpart spun with a steel trident, delivering a thunderous slap that launched the sword hurtling toward the prince's table.

**Chapter 4019: Assassination Attempt**

By the time anyone reacted, the blade had already reached the banquet table. The entire assembly froze in shock. Prince Zou stared wide-eyed, unable to believe what was unfolding. Zou Wuxiao lay slumped in drunken oblivion while Zou Wuhui mechanically picked at her food. Minister Mao gaped dumbstruck as the lethal projectile streaked toward the prince's heart—a direct hit would send His Highness straight to the afterlife.

At the last possible moment, Guan Yu's wine cup flew from his stationary position. The vessel struck the blade mid-flight, deflecting it past Zou Wuxiao's ear. Wine splashed across the drunkard's face as he bellowed, "Fine vintage! Another round!"

Guan Yu had suspected treachery earlier when noticing the monkey-masked performer's peculiar sword drills. Though initially lulled into complacency by the staff's appearance, his vigilance had ultimately saved the prince.

**Chapter 4020: Not Your Fault**

Before the stunned prince could recover, the masked duo lunged forward. The monkey-masked assailant produced a dagger, hurling it with deadly intent. Wang Jun flung a platter to disrupt the attack while Guan Yu intercepted the blade with a wine jug.

"Impudent curs!" Guan Yu roared, unsheathing his Soulfall Blade. The assassins recoiled under the weapon's oppressive aura. While Guan Yu engaged them head-on, Zou Wuhui shielded the prince—their contrasting reflexes revealing their priorities.

As guards finally converged, the assassins made their escape. Guan Yu stopped Wang Jun from pursuing: "Let retreating enemies flee." Turning to the prince, he asked urgently, "Your Highness, are you injured?"

"Thanks to your timely intervention," Prince Zou replied, composure regained. His glare shifted to the snoring Zou Wuxiao. "Drag this drunken fool away! No more wine for him!"

Minister Mao ordered city-wide lockdowns, but the prince waved him off. "This was premeditated. No use chasing phantoms."

"Forgive my negligence!" Mao prostrated himself.

"Your intent was honorable," the prince sighed. "But we must depart at dawn. With these three young heroes," he gestured to Guan Yu's group, "no danger shall prevail."

**Chapter 4021: Gratitude Declined**

When Xiao Zhi returned from escorting his beloved Du Bingyan, he found chaos. "Why wasn't the acting troupe vetted?" His blunt question reopened fresh wounds.

Wang Jun elbowed him silent as Prince Zou inquired about the missed introduction. "She had affairs to settle," Xiao Zhi deflected, though internally he thought: *My woman's not some court spectacle for your appraisal.*

The prince chuckled. "You three are comrades, not subordinates. Should she wish to join our journey..."

"Your kindness is noted," Xiao Zhi interjected, "but travel companions must remain nimble."

As the party prepared for their predawn departure, Guan Yu studied the wine-stained floor. This failed assassination was merely the overture—greater dangers lurked ahead on the road to the capital.
