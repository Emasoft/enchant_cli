“The best approach is just this,” Guan Yu stood in place, watching the opposing group walk past. These people seemed honest and amiable, but what irked Guan Yu was their refusal to clarify their identities.

He was nearly certain they belonged to the True Sun Sect, yet they stubbornly denied it, creating an uncomfortable tension. Guan Yu even considered tailing them to observe how they would handle encounters with the Demon Soul Sect. If they refused to reveal themselves in front of him, how would they act before the Demon Soul disciples? The old man from the True Sun Sect earlier had proven shrewd, discerning Guan Yu’s status as a seasoned martial artist and remarking on his uncommon caliber. Such perceptiveness spoke volumes about their capabilities.

Guan Yu speculated that the True Sun Sect had only sent a small contingent—perhaps to test their luck or because their influence had stagnated after years of hiding. After much deliberation, he decided to follow and witness the interaction between the True Sun Sect and the Demon Soul Sect.

Keeping a safe distance under the thick fog’s cover, he tracked their blurred silhouettes, confident they wouldn’t detect him. After a while, the group halted abruptly. For unknown reasons, they soon veered north instead of continuing straight—a direction that diverged from the Demon Soul Sect’s path. Guan Yu smirked. *How cunning. They’re avoiding confrontation with the Demon Soul Sect. This only confirms they’re True Sun members.*

Returning to his tent, Guan Yu resolved to monitor the Demon Soul Sect’s movements. If they acted, his group would follow; if not, they’d wait. By shadowing them, locating Miao City would be inevitable.

Night fell, pitch-black and thick with unrelenting fog. Though humid, the moisture-laden air offered slight relief from the day’s heat. Guan Yu ordered two-person shifts for night watch, prioritizing safety.

The next morning, Xiaomei prepared supplies while Guan Yu marveled at the unusual calm—the first windless night he’d experienced in the desert. “We’ll camp here and keep waiting,” he declared. “As long as we watch the Demon Soul Sect, we’ll stay put until Miao City emerges. If they move, we’ll follow promptly.”

Xiaomei nodded. “Have you sent anyone to observe them?”

“Of course. Two senior brothers are already stationed there,” Guan Yu replied. “Our water and rations are dwindling. Moving now would deplete them faster. We wait.”

Siqi approached. “If Xiaomei can sense Miao City’s location, why not station ourselves precisely there?”

“No need. Trust my plan,” Guan Yu said, glancing at the stubborn fog. If it persisted, Miao City might not appear at all. Better to conserve energy than exhaust themselves.

Another day passed, bringing them closer to the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The Demon Soul Sect remained inactive, and Guan Yu maintained his composure. The fog worsened, visibility dropping from a hundred meters to barely thirty. He deployed more scouts to track their rivals, as limited sightlines risked losing track of their position.

Two days later, dawn brought despair. If the fog didn’t lift today, their entire expedition would be in vain. But as Guan Yu exited his tent, he gasped—the eastern sky blazed clear, the sun rising unobstructed. The fog had vanished, revealing a cloudless expanse.

“The fog’s gone! Finally!” he exclaimed. “With this sun, today will be scorching. One more day of this heat, and Miao City will surely appear tomorrow.”

The ensuing days were brutal. Temperatures neared 50 degrees Celsius, scorching sand beneath their feet. Everyone resorted to wooden sandals, while Wang Jun ingeniously dug a two-meter pit, nestling his tent within for shade. Guan Yu, wielding his Falling Soul Blade, carved a three-meter trench with effortless strikes, inspiring both awe and envy among his sweat-drenched comrades.

“Envy’s pointless,” Wang Jun grumbled. “He uses internal energy—we’re stuck with manual labor.”

By nightfall, the group settled into their shaded pits, enduring the sweltering stillness. Xiaomei vanished, likely seeking cooler refuge.

“One more day,” Siqi said, anticipation mingling with dread. “Miao City appears tonight. They say it vanishes by dawn, leaving only a year’s wait for another chance.”

Guan Yu nodded. “A single night of bloodshed. Who knows what awaits inside?”

Siqi hesitated. “If Xiaomei turns against us in Miao City... will she still help?”

“The Eight Drums Technique matters deeply to her,” Guan Yu replied. “But obtaining it would paint a target on her back. She doesn’t realize it yet—no use persuading her.”

He’d considered recruiting her sect under his patronage, building his own faction in case of a future rift with the Cloud Azure Sect. But Xiaomei’s ambition and independence made this unlikely.

As noon passed, the heat intensified. The Demon Soul Sect suffered casualties from heatstroke, while the Scarlet Lotus Sect’s camels collapsed, immobilizing their caravan. Only Guan Yu’s prepared group endured relatively unscathed.

Wang Jun, roasting in his pit, cursed, “How do people survive in tropics? Even Africans would melt here!”

In her tent, the Demon Soul Sect’s Right Envoy pondered a wooden talisman—a mysterious artifact from their leader. Its purpose eluded her, but tonight’s trial loomed. If the Eight Drums Technique didn’t surface, she might be trapped in Miao City for a year. Survival was plausible, but the cost?

As the sun dipped, anticipation crackled like the baking sands. Miao City’s gates would soon open—beckoning them into a night of peril and revelation.
