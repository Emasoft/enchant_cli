Guan Yu nodded in acknowledgment. Chen Tianxiao continued, "Experts from other academies all conceal their depths. Moreover, no institution would reveal their team members' true capabilities—they devise countless methods to keep their fighters' strengths hidden. Every school spies for information, desperate to uncover rivals' secrets. Remember during last year's Taekwondo tournament? Guiyang Academy unexpectedly fielded a lower first-tier combatant. How terrifying that was."

Guan Yu looked surprised. He hadn't imagined so many hidden masters existed among these institutions.

"The matches should begin soon. Let's go down."

Following Chen Tianxiao to the basketball court's center, Guan Yu was stopped by a teacher. "Student, please show your competition credentials." Guan Yu presented his pass to Mr. Guo, Kaihuang Academy's physical education instructor.

After examining the document, Mr. Guo nodded permission. The tournament rules specified five participants drawing lots to determine opponents. Losers and byes would face off in final elimination rounds. Below were competition essentials and foul regulations.

Guan Yu and Chen Tianxiao stepped forward to draw sealed envelopes. Chen Tianxiao opened his first—a blank slip. The crowd chuckled, congratulating his good fortune. Guan Yu's envelope revealed a name: Zhang Han.

Matchups were set: Guan Yu vs. Zhang Han; Wang Hu vs. Wei Yong. Losers would duel while Chen Tianxiao awaited the final defeated party. This structure promised swift progression. As Guan Yu and Zhang Han took positions, the audience hushed, breath held in anticipation.

**Chapter 1850: The Sister-in-Law**

Guan Yu studied his opponent, struck by vague familiarity. Zhang Han possessed striking beauty—large dewy eyes reminiscent of an anime doll. "Heavens," Guan Yu thought, "how could I strike such an endearing girl?"

His scrutiny revealed no discernible strength, though her aura faintly resembled Yang Conghan's. "Could she know the Yang Family techniques?" Suddenly, recognition flashed—she was the girl kidnapped that night, rescued by black-clad Yang Conghan.

Clearly, Yang Conghan had withheld information. Guan Yu now felt certain of Zhang Han's connection to her. "What's your relationship with Yang Conghan?" he demanded bluntly.

Unfazed, Zhang Han giggled. "Brother-in-law! Fancy you remembering me!" The crowd buzzed—whose sister could she be? Speculations flew: "Lü Mei?" "Perhaps A'mei's sibling—they share that cuteness."

Guan Yu whispered, "Why compete? For amusement?"

"To prove my capabilities."

"Was that kidnapping staged by Yang Conghan?"

"You wrong Sister Yang! I was truly abducted. She merely happened by."

Nodding, Guan Yu told the teacher, "I forfeit." Let Zhang Han advance—she couldn't defeat him anyway. He'd later face Wang Hu/Wei Yong's loser.

Their hushed exchange left bystanders perplexed. "Since you concede, Zhang Han advances," declared Mr. Guo. Returning to seats, Chen Tianxiao inquired, "Why forfeit? Know her?"

Guan Yu nodded silently. Zhang Han busied herself with competition paperwork—health certificates, ID copies—for the interprovincial tournament. Completing formalities, she bounded to Guan Yu. "Thanks, brother-in-law! I'll praise you extravagantly to sister!"

"Save flattery. Does Yang Conghan teach you?"

Zhang Han plopped onto Guan Yu's lap, gesturing animatedly. "Uncle Yang himself! Since Yang伯伯's gravely ill with only Conghan continuing the lineage, the techniques must pass outside. Yang伯母 died in childbirth, so Uncle dotes on us."

Guan Yu partly believed. Traditionalists might decry lacking male heirs, but modern sensibilities prevailed. "Why were you kidnapped?"

"Father's rivals. They threatened him through me. Luckily, sister Yang intervened—thanks to you! Had you not been there..."

Wang Hu and Wei Yong's match commenced—both lower third-tier practitioners. Wang specialized in defense with rebound damage; Wei favored agile assaults. Their clash would hinge on technical superiority despite equal tiers.

**Chapter 1851: Cold and Hard**

Wang Hu stomped, fists clenched as white qi enveloped him—cruder version of Guan Yu's "egg-shell" barrier. Wei danced around seeking openings. Observers noted Wei's cunning versus Wang's stolid defense.

"Attack! Fight!" Zhang Han wriggled on Guan Yu's lap, testing his resolve. "My legs numb," Guan Yu protested. She smirked at his composure. "Brother-in-law's restraint impresses."

Their banter ceased as combat intensified. Wei launched palm strikes rebounding painfully. Seizing momentary shield weakness, Wang pounced. Wei's desperate counterattack backfired—Mr. Guo declared Wang victorious.

**Chapter 1852: Niece**

During Guan Yu's match against Wei Yong, spectators gasped as Guan Yu materialized behind his opponent. "You lose," he declared. Wei conceded, mistaking mercy for mockery.

Zhang Han cheered: "Crush him slowly!" Guan Yu tweaked her nose. "What if I lose?"

"Impossible! One arm suffices!"

As Guan Yu faced Wei Yong, the latter backflipped three meters—landing only to find Guan Yu already before him. "Rest well?" Guan Yu shook his hand.

Mr. Guo announced commencement. Wei's agile retreat proved futile—Guan Yu shadowed every movement until whispering defeat in his ear. The crowd marveled at phantom afterimages before Wei acknowledged superior skill.
