“Hmph, are you scared now?” The fake Laila deliberately flicked the grenade’s pin ring with her finger, glaring at Guan Yu. “Then get out of my way this instant!”

“Fine, I’ll move. I’ll move right now. Feel free to leave whenever you want.” Guan Yu immediately sidestepped, clearing the doorway. When his opponent remained motionless, he realized she likely lacked the strength to take another step.

Her current upright posture relied entirely on the mutual support between her and Laili, whose eyes now fluttered weakly, her body utterly drained.

The impostor finally noticed something amiss and snarled, “You—what trick did you play? Why has my strength…?”

Guan Yu cut her off, suppressing a smirk. “You’re fine. Leave now—I won’t stop you.” As he spoke, he shifted closer to the window, distancing himself further from the exit—a silent assurance he wouldn’t ambush her.

Dragging her exhausted body forward was arduous enough, but supporting Laili’s dead weight proved overwhelming. Though masked, beads of sweat visibly glistened on the fake Laila’s forehead.

The doorway loomed before her, yet her legs refused to obey. Laili had already fallen unconscious, and with her last vestige of strength spent, the impostor collapsed alongside her.

In a flash, Guan Yu lunged forward, seizing the grenade from her grasp the moment she hit the floor. “This thing’s lethal—can’t risk it detonating. Carrying heavy artillery like this? Impressive.” He tucked away the explosive, then gently lifted Laili onto the sofa, muttering, “Jinhua’s soporific incense works wonders—fast-acting too. Must remember to use it more… though outdoors, it’d probably be useless.”

Outside, Jinhua observed the scene through binoculars before barging in with Acai. “Mission accomplished?” she chimed, while Acai checked the impostor’s pulse, mistaking her for dead.

“Your incense worked perfectly,” Guan Yu acknowledged, slumping onto the couch. “But I’m getting dizzy too. Antidote. Now.” Jinhua giggled, planting a firm kiss on his lips. Gradually, his head cleared.

Acai averted his eyes, blushing at Jinhua’s boldness. “Open all windows to ventilate the room,” she ordered. Nodding, Acai hurried to comply.

“Should’ve used your incense earlier,” Guan Yu remarked. “Would’ve saved me that tedious charade with the imposter.”

“Didn’t expect you’d negotiate so long!” Jinhua clung to his arm affectionately. “Thought she’d attack once she realized the head was fake. With your skills, I assumed you’d handle her easily.”

“Clever girl. Still, this fake Laila was trouble—especially packing grenades.” He showed her the explosive.

“Thank heavens we were indoors,” Jinhua said. “Outdoors, that grenade could’ve ruined everything.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Odd—why did the incense knock them out cold, but only made me dizzy? We were in the same room.”

Jinhua pondered. “Maybe prolonged exposure built your immunity? Remember at Yang Conghan’s villa? Zhang Han and Yang collapsed, but you stayed alert. Perhaps your unique constitution resists it.”

Their speculation was interrupted as Guan Yu instructed Acai to bind the impostor. To Jinhua, he teased, “Wake Laili up—but no kissing her.”

“My kisses are yours alone.” Jinhua produced a thumb-sized gourd-shaped vial, its brown surface etched with intricate white patterns. She waved it under Laili’s nose before pocketing it.

“What’s that?” Guan Yu asked.

“Antidote vapor. Don’t worry—she’ll wake soon.”

Examining the wooden vial, Guan Yu noted its hollow design. “It’s lightweight. How’s it never empty?”

“My master gifted it years ago,” Jinhua explained. “The carved symbols preserve a special wood’s odor—pungent, but effective. The scent regenerates over time.”

Indeed, opening the vial released a foul stench, yet sealing it contained the aroma completely. “Marvelous trinket,” Guan Yu remarked, returning it. “Though the stink’s unbearable.”

“Fragrant poison requires foul antidote,” Jinhua retorted. When Guan Yu jested about her “sweet” kiss versus the vial’s stench, she playfully swatted him.

Meanwhile, Acai—now捆绑 the impostor—earned Jinhua’s wrath for stifling laughter. “Laugh again and I’ll knock your teeth out!” she threatened.

After reviving the captives, Jinhua tricked Acai into using the vial, triggering horrific itching. As he writhed bloody, Guan Yu intervened. “Enough games—help him.”

Chuckling, Jinhua tapped him with a sachet, curing the itch instantly. Panting and bloodied, Acai vowed never to cross her again.

Laili stirred, rubbing her temples. “Guan Yu? What happened? Did the impostor escape?”

“We caught her,” Jinhua announced triumphantly, while Acai lay traumatized—a living testament to her methods.
