“This…” Wen Songbai was utterly confused by Guan Yu and Wen Ya’s behavior. Dragged into the house by Wen Ya, Guan Yu followed without hesitation.

“Wenwen, don’t try to persuade me again. I won’t go to the hospital.”

Upon entering the room, Guan Yu saw Wen Ya’s mother lying on the bed. Her sallow complexion, emaciated face, and weak voice betrayed her critical condition.

Guan Yu closed his eyes slightly, focusing his mind. The ancient coin悬浮 at the center of his consciousness glowed faintly as the words “Detection System” blazed brightly. An imperceptible脑电波 emanated from his mind, enveloping Wen Ya’s mother.

“Mom, your kidney function has necrotized. Without removal, it’ll affect the other kidney and endanger your life. If we find a matching donor, you could have a transplant and regain health!” Wen Ya urged.

Mei Fanglan shook her head. “If I undergo surgery, you and Songbai won’t survive.”

Wen Ya fell silent. She understood her mother’s meaning – even a basic nephrectomy would strain their finances, let alone a transplant.

“Don’t worry about medical costs. I’ll handle it,” Wen Ya insisted.

Mei Fanglan sighed. “We know you’ve been working multiple jobs. I don’t want to burden you further.”

Tears welled in Wen Ya’s eyes. “These hardships mean nothing if you can live healthily.”

“But…”

“Auntie, your kidney isn’t fully necrotic. No removal is needed.” Guan Yu interjected suddenly.

Mei Fanglan turned to him in surprise.

Guan Yu smiled. “Your kidney is only 99% necrotic, correct?”

“How could you know without my medical records?”

“I practice Chinese medicine.”

Mei Fanglan’s eyes lit up with hope. “You mean… there’s still a chance?”

“That 1% is key. I’m confident I can heal you without surgery.”

“You… you’re serious?”

“Let me demonstrate.” Guan Yu rolled up his sleeves.

“Wait!” Wen Ya protested. “We don’t even know him!”

“I’m your classmate and boyfriend. What ill intent could I have?” Guan Yu chuckled.

“Wenwen! You hid such an accomplished boyfriend?” Mei Fanglan scolded.

As tensions rose, Guan Yu began treatment. His fingers moved with precision, pressing acupuncture points as energy flowed through Mei Fanglan’s body. After dramatic convulsions and expulsion of toxins, her complexion transformed from sallow to healthy.

“It… it worked?” Wen Ya stared in awe.

“Your mother’s condition requires gradual treatment. I’ll prepare herbal prescriptions,” Guan Yu said, rising to leave.

As they walked out, Wen Ya finally asked: “Why help us?”

“Consider it an exchange – you lead the dance troupe, I heal your mother. No debts between us.” Guan Yu smiled. “Though you should know – I have multiple girlfriends already. You’re safe from my advances.”

Wen Ya’s eyes widened at his blunt honesty.

“Now,” Guan宇 concluded, “Shall we discuss your dance rehearsal schedule?”
