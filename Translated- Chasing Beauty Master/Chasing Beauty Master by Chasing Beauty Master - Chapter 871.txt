Guan Yu released his grip and looked up to find Meimei and Shuangshuang both stunned. His earlier kick at the rock hadn’t just frightened A-Liu—it had shocked the sisters too.

Shuangshuang’s mouth hung open so wide one could’ve stuffed an egg inside, remaining agape for a long moment. Meimei recovered first, exclaiming, “Brother Guan, are you alright?”

As Guan Yu let go of A-Liu, the man scrambled away on all fours, scared out of his wits. A-Liu could attest he’d never run so fast in his life, his legs moving like the wind.

**Chapter 2229: Share the Spoils**

Shuangshuang’s jaw remained slack, her astonishment lingering. Meimei repeated urgently, “Brother Guan, are you hurt?”

A-Liu’s frantic escape left dust in his wake—a testament to pure terror. Guan Yu scratched his head sheepishly. “Oh, I’m fine. Just wanted to scare him. Didn’t mean to startle you all.”

Only when Meimei called her name did Shuangshuang snap out of her daze. “Sweet heavens! Handsome Brother, is your foot a sledgehammer? You shattered that huge rock in one kick! Look how completely it’s broken—was this stone fake?”

Qu Shuangshuang crouched doubtfully, picking up a fragment to examine. “Sis, this... this is real stone!”

“Of course it’s real. What else would it be?” retorted the village chief’s daughter, gazing at Guan Yu with worshipful eyes. Handsome, wealthy, and martial-skilled—he embodied her perfect prince charming. She’d expected drama from Shuangshuang’s antics, but Guan Yu’s display had eclipsed all expectations, making her desire him even more.

Meimei knew the rock was genuine—no movie props here. Yet Guan Yu’s feat defied belief, though wonders existed. Like the old man north of town with paranormal abilities who could levitate flowerpots—something Meimei had witnessed firsthand.

“Brother, was that kung fu? Teach me!” Shuangshuang pleaded, bouncing excitedly. In her eyes, Guan Yu now loomed godlike. “If that pest A-Liu bothers me again, you’ll kick his... *eggs* to dust!”

Meimei flushed at her sister’s crudeness. “Shuangshuang! Mind your words!”

“I don’t care if Brother laughs!” Shuangshuang declared, chest puffed. Her earlier boldness about marrying Guan Yu had dissolved into bashfulness.

Guan Yu chuckled. “She’s right. If he pesters you again...” He mimed a kick, making Ling’er blush. The city-born girl had seen his cultivation prowess before when Master Qing’s disciple visited.

“You’re scarier than our village’s paranormal elder,” Meimei remarked.

Intrigued, Guan Yu inquired about this mysterious figure. “He charges exorbitantly,” Shuangshuang interjected. “People call him a living immortal!”

The chief’s daughter added, “Once, he held a raw egg and cooked it bare-handed in minutes!”

“I must meet him,” Guan Yu mused, suspecting a fellow cultivator exploiting villagers. “But first—”

“Let’s buy medicine!” Ling’er reminded.

“Right, and phones for all!” Guan Yu announced. The chief’s daughter nearly leapt for joy—she’d get an iPhone! Her knockoff smartphone paled next to Ling’er’s, but Guan Yu’s generosity knew bounds.

**Chapter 2230: Meeting a Tycoon**

At the Apple store, a greeter welcomed them. “Three latest models,” Guan Yu ordered.

The chief’s daughter grabbed gold—“Tuhao Gold!”—while Meimei hesitated. “It’s too expensive...”

“Nonsense.” Guan Yu selected silver for Meimei, white for Ling’er. After swiping his card, he instructed, “Replace their SIM cards with Apple’s nano-SIMs.”

The clerk beamed—today’s commission was secured.

“Mine’s already an iPhone,” Ling’er protested weakly.

“Yours is outdated,” Guan Yu insisted. Shuangshuang teased about charging “tuition” for phone tutorials, lightening the mood.

As they compared devices, the chief’s daughter nearly wavered on her gold choice. “Most choose gold,” the clerk advised. Content, she kept hers.

Later at the pharmacy, Guan Yu focused on Western medicine for Auntie’s leg—herbal remedies being inadequate. His true treatment would channel internal energy, but pain relief mattered.
