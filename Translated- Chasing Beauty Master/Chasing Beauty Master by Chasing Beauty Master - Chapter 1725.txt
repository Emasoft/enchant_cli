Before the opposing cultivators could react, they were already struck down by flying human projectiles. The cultivators' frail bodies, battered in this manner, were practically rendered combat-ineffective.

Hada Bei led the Hada tribe's mighty warriors like tigers amidst sheep, showing no mercy to the Jia Sect members. Each strike sent craftsmen flying, incapacitating opponents with single blows. Some unfortunate souls struck in vital points directly lost their lives.

Faced with such slaughter from the Hada tribe, the Jia Sect members grew vigilant. They regrouped to face the Hada warriors in formation.

Truthfully, the Hada tribe had no desire for such carnage. Their goal was merely to drive off the Jia Sect members. None wished to stain their hands with blood.

Under the protection of Third and Fourth Brother, Ling Su advanced forward. The clever youth mounted a camel for better vantage, his elevated position granting clearer sightlines across the battlefield.

As the Jia Sect members consolidated forces, Ling Su frowned at the sight before him – nearly a hundred adversaries arrayed against them.

**Chapter 4512: Ambushed**

The numerical disparity between Hada Bei's twenty warriors and the hundred-strong Jia Sect force seemed overwhelming. None had anticipated such numbers from the sect. Even the Hada tribe's famed might would be tested against these odds.

Hada Bei's expression tightened. Previous encounters with the Jia Sect had ended with their swift rout, typically requiring only five or six warriors. This time he'd brought extra men, yet found himself outnumbered twenty to one. No wonder the sect stood their ground – numerical superiority bolstered their courage.

“We of the Hada tribe warn you!” Hada Bei thundered. “Leave now if you value your lives! Don’t presume your numbers grant license to arrogance here!”

In past encounters, the mere mention of “Hada” would send Jia Sect members fleeing. But today they stood firm, weapons at the ready.

Ling Su noticed a critical development – the Hada warriors had been subtly herded into a narrow passage flanked by felt tents. Only two warriors could engage abreast in this confined space, rendering the others useless in the rear.

This was clearly a premeditated trap, not coincidence. Yet Hada Bei, ever dismissive of the Jia Sect, remained oblivious to his disadvantage. Ling Su considered warning them, but saw little personal gain. He’d come merely to observe and assist peripherally – the Hada tribe's fate concerned him not.

When the Jia Sect remained silent, Hada Bei charged with a roar. Fists and feet sent opponents flying, but each felled enemy merely revealed another in the endless ranks. The situation shifted again as Jia Sect frontliners raised sharp spears and heavy shields.

Even the Hada's renowned strength faltered against cold steel. Though trained in Iron Skin techniques, their flesh remained vulnerable. Against coordinated spear formations in tight quarters, their bare-handed combat became perilous.

As the Jia Sect pressed their advantage, a faint glow emerged from their rear ranks. Ling Su sensed spiritual energy coalescing – enemy cultivators seizing this moment to unleash magic.

“Brother Hada Bei! Beward – spellcasters at the rear!” Ling Su shouted, drawing his Yunqing Sword. Chanting incantations, he channeled energy until the blade erupted in azure light, projecting a protective dome over the Hada warriors.

“You think your petty magics alone suffice?” Ling Su taunted, face alight with triumph. “Break this shield first, scum!”

The defensive barrier reinvigorated Hada Bei. “Hah! Well done, brother!” he roared, snatching an enemy spear. When frontal assaults failed against shield walls, he hurled the weapon skyward like a javelin. The spear arced and plunged into densely packed ranks, impaling an unfortunate sect member.

At that moment, the Jia Sect's spell manifested – a whirling vortex materialized overhead, raining blade-like projectiles onto Ling Su's shield with ear-splitting clangs.

**Chapter 4513: Finest Hour**

Though Ling Su's shield was a Yunqing Sect signature defense, the coordinated assault overwhelmed his solo efforts. As the barrier neared collapse, he reinforced it with hand seals and incantations, draining his spiritual reserves but preventing total breach.

When the celestial blades finally ceased, the surrounding felt tents lay shredded. “Magnificent!” Hada Bei cheered. “You’re the finest among us!”

Hada tribe morale soared as Jia Sect forces fell silent. From a distance, Guan Yu observed the azure glow. “That’s the Yunqing Shield,” he remarked to Si Qi. “Only Ling Su wields such techniques.”

“Should we aid him?” asked Aze.

“Let him reap what he sowed,” Guan Yu coldly replied. “He forfeited our fellowship when he endangered us.” None moved to assist.

Back at the battlefield, an eerie stillness descended... until a woman's magnetic voice rang out: “You think you’ve survived? How naive.”

Before Ling Su could react, the vortex reappeared. “Retreat!” he screamed, leaping from his camel. But celestial blades already rained down, shredding Hada formations. Ling Su escaped with two bleeding gashes on his back, turning to see twenty warriors fallen – some crushed by comrades, others mortally wounded.

**Chapter 4514: Critical Injuries**

The second assault defied all magical logic – no preparation, no energy fluctuations. Only later would Ling Su learn the Jia Sect leader, a cultivation master, had orchestrated this trap. While Ling Su blocked the initial volley, she’d prepared the fatal follow-up.

By dawn, the Hada tribe lay decimated. Hada Bei himself was captured, the Brut tribe nearly exterminated. Ling Su, clinging to a camel's flank, fled into the desert – the sole survivor of this calculated annihilation. His back wounds bled freely, each jostling step agony. Yet survival, however bitter, remained preferable to the alternative awaiting those left behind.
