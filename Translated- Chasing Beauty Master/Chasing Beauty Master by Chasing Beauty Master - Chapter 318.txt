“Guan Yu knew that Gao Wei was probably in a bad mood right now. His gaze reluctantly lingered on her chest before he turned around with a sullen expression.

‘Take off your clothes!’ Gao Wei demanded again.

‘If you turn around again, I’ll gouge out your eyes!’

Just as Guan Yu instinctively started to turn, Gao Wei’s furious voice rang out.

Guan Yu sniffed and said over his shoulder, ‘If you won’t let me face you, how am I supposed to help you undress?’

Guan Yu was tempted to pounce and sink his teeth into her a thousand times over. This bastard was clearly taking advantage of the situation to undress her on purpose!

‘Take your clothes off!’ Gao Wei took a deep breath and said through gritted teeth.

‘Why should I take mine off?’ Guan Yu retorted.

‘You idiot, take them off for me to wear!’ Gao Wei fumed.

‘Oh!’ Guan Yu feigned realization. ‘If I give you mine, what will I wear?’

They had been awakened from sleep by Zhan Shouwang and others, both wearing only thin T-shirts. This meant one of them would have to expose themselves to the other.

‘If you don’t take them off, I’ll tell Xiao Juan you harassed me!’ Gao Wei threatened coldly. She’d never seen such a brazen pervert.

‘Go ahead! Xiao Juan won’t mind,’ Guan Yu laughed.

‘You…’ Gao Wei’s recently healed lungs ached again. Guan Yu was clearly doing this on purpose.

At that moment, Gao Wei heard footsteps approaching. Turning, she saw Guan Yu with a mischievous grin.

‘Who said you could turn around?!’ Panic surged through her as her heart raced wildly.

Guan Yu remained silent, quickly removing his shirt.

‘What… what are you doing?’ Gao Wei stammered.

Guan Yu draped his shirt over her chest and teased, ‘What do you think I’m doing? Want me to change your clothes? I’m not that kind of man!’

‘You… scoundrel!’ Gao Wei seethed, humiliated again.

‘I warned you repeatedly, but you never believed me!’ Guan Yu said innocently.

‘You did this on purpose!’ Gao Wei nearly cried, convinced Guan Yu had orchestrated this to see her exposed.

Guan Yu sighed dramatically. ‘I’m the shirtless one now. If I lied, I’d only suffer more. Why would I do that?’

‘Would it kill you to tell a white lie?!’ Gao Wei glared.

Guan宇’s face twitched. Since when did women need reasons to be unreasonable?

Chapter 803: Hunting

Sometimes women needed no reason to be unreasonable—except perhaps men’s denseness!

Gao Wei wanted a way to save face, but Guan Yu either pretended not to notice or truly misunderstood, blaming her for the wardrobe malfunction.

This angered Gao Wei further.

Guan Yu stood abruptly. ‘Treating you drained my energy. I’ll cook us some game.’

‘Wait!’ Gao Wei called out.

He turned. ‘What?’

She stared at the bullet wound on his arm and his bloodstained pants. ‘Your injuries…’

Guan宇 shrugged. ‘Old news. I’ll cook. Rest.’

Tears welled in Gao Wei’s eyes as she realized these wounds were from protecting her. He’d carried her while bleeding, saving her repeatedly.

Over the next days, Guan宇 hunted and treated Gao Wei’s injuries. Their interactions grew more intimate, her gaze softening with unspoken emotions.

Five days later, Guan宇 finished her final treatment. ‘You’re healed!’

Gao Wei jumped up, overjoyed. ‘Thank you!’

‘Don’t thank me yet. You’ll owe me!’ Guan宇 joked.

‘In your dreams!’ Gao Wei retorted.

He led her to a secluded spring. ‘Clean up. You reek.’

Blushing, she undressed and entered the water. Unbeknownst to her, Guan宇’s detection system gave him a full view.

Later, they argued about hunting. ‘You’re not even trying!’ she accused.

‘Let’s bet. If game comes to us, you kiss me. If not, I kiss you.’

‘No!’ Gao Wei refused.

As they walked, a sudden movement in the bushes proved Guan宇 right—a wild boar charged toward them.

Gao Wei froze. ‘You planned this!’

‘Nope. Just lucky,’ Guan宇 grinned, tackling the boar with ease.

‘Fine…’ she muttered, cheeks flushing. ‘But no kiss!’

He laughed, hauling the prize over his shoulder. ‘We’ll eat well tonight!’
