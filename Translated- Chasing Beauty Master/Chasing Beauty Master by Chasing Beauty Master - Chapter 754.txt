The blue sphere crackling with electricity drifted slowly toward Yang Hua. With a contemptuous smirk, Yang Hua thought, "Such a sluggish attack could never hit anyone. The arrogance of the born privileged."

Ignoring the approaching sphere, Yang Hua continued his relentless assault on Chen Tianxiao. Yet each strike proved futile, dissipating harmlessly against his opponent.

Guan Yu found this technique peculiar yet familiar—it vaguely resembled his own gravity manipulation system from years past. Chen Tianxiao's method involved balancing his body's weight against gravitational pull while enveloping himself in a thin protective shield. Suspended midair like ephemeral mist, he repelled all attacks as effortlessly as one brushes away air.

The countermeasure was simple, but Yang Hua's blind aggression made him overlook it. Chen Tianxiao remained invulnerable—all assaults passed through him as through empty space. The solution lay not in mystical techniques but crude physical engagement, which would force Chen Tianxiao to abandon his ethereal state.

Oblivious, Yang Hua kept fruitlessly attacking while Guan Yu realized the danger: "That sphere must be destroyed before it closes in!"

As the electric orb neared, Yang Hua belatedly grasped his peril. The projectile he'd dismissed now pursued him relentlessly, swelling as it absorbed electromagnetic waves. The crowd roared with laughter at his panicked sprinting, the sphere expanding and accelerating like a ravenous shadow.

"Pathetic! Getting chased by a glorified firework!" Zhang Han mocked through mouthfuls of snacks. Her words sparked Guan Yu's realization—the sphere was pure theater, all spectacle without substance.

Exhausted, Yang Hua raised trembling hands to surrender... only for the sphere to pop like a soap bubble. The anticlimax stunned the arena.

Chen Tianxiao rose, conjuring an identical sphere. "I surrender!" Yang Hua croaked, drenched in sweat. Laughter erupted as the crowd grasped the ruse—they'd witnessed not combat, but masterful farce.

"An educational demonstration," Chen Tianxiao remarked, extinguishing the harmless sphere against Yang Hua's cowering form. The humiliated fighter sat trembling, realizing he'd been played for a fool, his frantic marathon merely comic relief.

Amidst jeers, the final match commenced: Guan Yu versus Liu Dian, a gaunt figure exuding corpse-like stillness. The man's cadaverous appearance unsettled even veterans—a living specter with dead eyes and ritualistic beard.

As Liu Dian's shadow clones materialized, the arena held its breath. Three identical figures surrounded Guan Yu, their synchronized assault testing his defenses. The true battle had begun—not against flesh, but phantoms.

Yang Hua's humiliation culminated as the crowd's laughter echoed. Guan Yu marveled at Chen Tianxiao's cunning—a brilliant feint exploiting psychological weakness over physical force.

"Why guard against attacks from an exhausted foe?" Guan Yu pondered, until Zhang Han's crass observation illuminated the truth: the entire pursuit had been psychological warfare, the sphere's menace an elaborate bluff.

Liu Dian's skeletal frame belied lethal precision. His triple doppelgangers launched coordinated barrages, forcing Guan Yu into evasive maneuvers. Each clone mirrored the original's lifeless gaze, complicating target identification.

The crowd buzzed as Guan Yu's shield flickered under the triple assault. "Is this three-on-one combat?" spectators murmured. Yet when Guan Yu struck a clone, it dissolved into smoke—the real battle required outthinking death itself.
