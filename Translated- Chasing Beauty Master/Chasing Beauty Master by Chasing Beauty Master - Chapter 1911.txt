After hearing Old Master Duan’s lengthy account, Guan Yu felt a mix of emotions. At the very least, the Duan family’s grandfather had been remarkably capable. Amidst such dire circumstances, he had remained calm enough to flee with his children. It was sheer luck they had survived. Had they been in the town instead of the fields when disaster struck, escape would have been impossible.

One detail particularly stood out to Guan Yu. He asked, “Uncle Duan, you mentioned that East Sea Town is isolated and nearly impossible for outsiders to enter. Why is that?”

“There’s a reason,” Old Master Duan replied. “When I was young, my grandfather told me the East Sea has another name—Crescent Sea—because its shape resembles a crescent moon. Some also call it Crescent Lake.

Our East Sea Town lies along its shores, surrounded by the sea on one side and towering mountains on the other three. Those mountains are densely forested, forming an immense woodland. Almost no one could traverse those woods to discover our town, and few even knew of its existence.”

Guan Yu nodded, finally understanding. Given its seclusion, it was no wonder so few knew of the East Sea’s location. After the calamity, nearly all the townsfolk perished, and outsiders remained oblivious.

The occasional rumor might have leaked—tales of strange happenings, mysterious water creatures—but these were likely fabrications. Old Master Duan, who had lived through the disaster, confirmed that while the sea had behaved oddly, no such monsters had appeared.

Having heard the story, Guan Yu steered the conversation to his true purpose. “Uncle Duan, despite the years that have passed, do you still remember the exact location of East Sea Town? Or could you trace the route back?”

This was the reason for his visit. Without the town’s coordinates, Guan Yu had little interest in stories, no matter how riveting.

Old Master Duan stroked his beard. “Faintly. I can’t guarantee I’ll find it, but I know it lies far to the north. Summers there are brief—practically nonexistent. Beyond summer, it’s winter.”

He added, “I also remember that no matter how cold it grew, the East Sea never froze. As a child, I thought all seas were like that. Later, I learned most seas freeze in winter—except ours.”

Though limited, Guan Yu found this useful. A general direction was better than nothing. More specifics would have been ideal, but this was a start.

**Chapter 5022: Confidence**

From Old Master Duan’s account, Guan Yu deduced that East Sea Town lay in the far north, near polar regions, with only fleeting summers. Winters were brutally cold, yet the sea remained unfrozen—a peculiar phenomenon.

Intrigued, Guan Yu grew eager to visit. The final volume of the Eight-Drum Technique was said to reside there, and he was determined to claim it.

Duan Ruxue stood abruptly. “Brother Wan, my father once shared more precise details about the town’s location. With this knowledge and proper preparations, we could be the first in the jianghu to seek it out. I wish to accompany you.”

“You want to come?” Guan Yu asked, surprised. Though he understood her urgency for the East Sea’s treasures, the journey promised danger. As a delicate young woman, her safety concerned him.

“Yes,” she said brightly. “I’d like to see my ancestral home. Besides, I can guide you. Isn’t that perfect?”

“I don’t object,” Guan Yu said cautiously. “But the road ahead is perilous. A frail woman like you might struggle.”

“Don’t underestimate me!” Duan Ruxue retorted, feigning offense. “I train regularly. And you’ll protect me, won’t you?”

Guan Yu inwardly sighed. *She knows she’ll be a burden yet insists on coming. Old Master Duan told her the route but not me—forcing me to take her along. Without her, we’re lost.*

Still, he understood their partnership. If they found the treasure, the Duans would demand a share. Sending Ruxue as an envoy made sense.

“I’ll do my best to protect you,” Guan Yu said, “but dangers are unpredictable. I can’t guarantee your safety.”

“I know,” Duan Ruxue replied. “I go willingly. Even if I die, no one will blame you. Besides, I have my own ways to survive.”

With that, Guan Yu relented. After briefing Jiang Yuankai, they could depart.

As Duan Ruxue escorted him to the estate gates, Guan Yu chuckled, “No need to see me off. I won’t get lost.”

“Hmph! You’re just rushing back to your two beauties,” she teased, pouting. “You wouldn’t even stay for dinner.”

“Guilty,” he admitted. “I’ve matters to settle. Once done, I’ll notify you. We’ll leave for the East Sea in a few days—don’t be impatient.”

With a playful flick to her forehead, he turned to leave.

“Ow!” She rubbed the spot, stamping her foot. “How mean, Brother Wan!”

To an outsider, they might seem a couple. But too much stood between them. Ruxue’s ambitions lay in expanding the Duan family, not romance. Though she admired Wan Hong as the finest man she’d met, his two lovers made sharing unthinkable—beneath her status.

**Chapter 5023: Crisis**

Returning to the inn, Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong noticed Guan Yu’s preoccupation. Qiqi held her tongue, abandoning her planned interrogation.

“What troubles you?” Wang Xiaorong asked.

“I’ve learned more about the East Sea,” Guan Yu said. “I must depart soon, but first, I’ll return to my sect. The journey will be dangerous—you two should stay.”

“We can help!” Wang Xiaorong pleaded. “I’m a skilled cultivator, and Qiqi’s no weakling. We won’t burden you.”

Their earnest looks wore him down. “Very well. I’ll arrange it. But you’ll need disguises. The sect will send others—this is too significant.”

**Chapter 5024: Joining the Quest**

Relieved, the women brightened. They’d gladly disguise themselves—even as maids—to stay by his side.

Guan Yu prepared to report to the Qingyun Sect. The Eight-Drum Technique’s emergence required a convincing lie to deceive Elder Xuanming.

The next day, visiting Jiang Yuankai’s manor, Guan Yu found the驸马爷 agitated. “Brother Wan! I was about to summon you. News arrived this morning—”

In the parlor, Jiang Yuankai revealed, “A major incident has occurred in the jianghu. Do you know of it?”

Guan Yu frowned. “What happened? Is it related to the East Sea treasure?”

“Possibly. After the northern floods, a massive黑洞 appeared beneath a mountain. Monstrous roars echo from it—witnesses describe a bat-like creature snatching people. Panic has spread.”

“This is the first I’ve heard,” Guan Yu said. “Why the delay?”

“It happened yesterday! The floods subsided ten days ago. During reconstruction, soldiers heard strange noises—like distorted duck calls—especially at night. Yesterday, two soldiers vanished. At dusk, a monster emerged, grabbed one, and retreated. Guards fainted from terror.”

Jiang Yuankai’s voice tightened. “The area’s now sealed off. Brother Wan, could this be a demonic beast? Might it seek the East Sea Dragon Pearl?”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. Decades prior, the武林盟主 Dai Xiaotian had repelled such creatures. Their return boded ill.

“If demons seek the pearl,” Guan Yu warned, “your household is in grave danger.”

“I know,” Jiang Yuankai sighed. “They might target my family. This is only the beginning.”

Guan Yu shared his findings: East Sea Town’s northern location, confirmed by Duan Ruxue.

Jiang Yuankai’s eyes narrowed. “Duan Ruxue? How would she know? My spies found nothing.”

“Her family hails from there,” Guan Yu explained. “She’ll guide us—for a share of the treasure.”

After a pause, Jiang Yuankai nodded. “If the legends hold, she’ll be rewarded. But let her know—greed invites consequences.”

Guan Yu agreed. With Jiang Yuankai’s approval, the expedition could begin. Yet the黑洞’s menace loomed—a threat intertwined with their quest, and perhaps the first move in a larger, darker game.
