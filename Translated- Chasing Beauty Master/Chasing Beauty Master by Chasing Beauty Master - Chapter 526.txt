Guanyu was stroking the little stray cat's head when it suddenly spoke, startling him. But as he recognized King Kong's voice, he gradually adjusted.

"Damn it, scared the hell outta me! Since you've parasitized this stray cat, I won't call you King Kong anymore. Let's give you a new name."

Upon hearing this, King Kong rolled his eyes at Guanyu. "You're the boss. Whatever you say."

"Don't be so grudging! I've thought hard about this name—it's definitely better than King Kong!"

King Kong feigned interest. "Not gonna call me 'Little Stray Cat,' are you?"

Guanyu shook his head. "How uncreative! When I saw this cat generating electricity, I immediately thought of Pikachu. But since Pikachu isn't a cat, let's compromise. How about... Pikacat?"

"Uh... Pikacat? Wow, what a *great* name!"

"Could you at least pretend to sound sincere?" Guanyu pinched Pikacat's tail.

The stimulated cat let out a loud "meow," making Guanyu burst into laughter. "Brat, we're sticking with Pikacat! Never thought you'd meow when hurt—hilarious!"

As Guanyu laughed, his Magic Shield Technique wavered. Seizing the chance, Pikacat whipped its tail, zapping Guanyu with lightning. Unprepared, Guanyu yelped in pain.

"You damned cat! I'll skin you alive!"

After their tussle, both exhausted human and cat noticed the sky turning dusky. Dawn would break in an hour or two.

"Keep up—I won't wait if you get lost," Guanyu warned before sprinting toward the Forest of Elves. Pikacat followed closely, matching his speed effortlessly.

At Narrow Pass, the guard who greeted them earlier stared wide-eyed at the cat. "Young Master Guan... did you capture that in Death Valley?"

Guanyu shook his head. "Found it before reaching the valley. Thought it looked pitiful. Know its breed?"

The guard examined the cat but shrugged. "Forgive my ignorance. At first glance, it seems ordinary, but there's something... spiritual about it."

"Just a regular cat," Guanyu chuckled, scooping up Pikacat while thinking: *What monster is this? Even elves familiar with magical beasts can't identify it. Yet how could a normal cat generate electricity?*

Baffled but lacking answers, Guanyu bid farewell and hurried to his quarters. Early-rising elves nodded politely as he passed. Desperate for sleep, he dove into bed—both to rest and conceal his nighttime excursion. Any questions about Pikacat could be brushed aside with lies.

He awoke to frantic knocking and Amy's voice: "Dragon Brother! Rise and shine!"

Guanyu groaned. Though Amy acted as his "morning angel," she felt more like a "morning devil."

**Chapter 1332: Compromise**

The kicked Pikacat glared resentfully at Guanyu but, bound by their master-servant pact, could only beg Amy for mercy with pitiful mews.

"Eek! Stay away! I don't want scratches!"

"Meooow!" The heartrending cry melted Amy's fear into compassion.

"Kitty, I'm sorry for kicking you!" She scooped up Pikacat. Guanyu didn't stop her—Amy's kindness shouldn't be punished by lies.

"Dragon Brother, I take back wanting to keep it. Just let me play with it for two days!"

Guanyu exhaled in relief, patting her head. "Good girl. You're maturing."

"Don't call me 'girl'!" Amy pouted, cuddling Pikacat. "What's its name?"

"Pikacat."

"How peculiar! What's the meaning?"

Guanyu hesitated. How to explain the Pikachu reference? "It's... my homeland's dialect. Where I'm from, cats are called Pikacats."

"Fascinating! Your home's Dragon Valley, right? When will you take me there?"

Guanyu swiftly deflected: "After I finish exploring the Forest of Elves."

*You're digging your own grave,* Pikacat telepathically jeered.

"One more word and I'll drown you!" Guanyu hissed.

Amy tilted her head. "Did someone else speak?"

"Your imagination," Guanyu glared at the smug cat in Amy's arms. Changing topics, he asked: "Is the Clan Leader awake?"

"Oh! Father wants you at the Advanced Magic Training Ground immediately! Something important!"

"About the chieftain succession?" Guanyu muttered. To Amy: "Wait here."

"No! I'm coming!"

"It might be dangerous—possibly fighting."

"Perfect! You can beat up the mean people!"

Resigned, Guanyu warned: "Control your temper," before rushing to the crowded training ground where Clan Leader Allen and elders stood on a platform.

"Quiet!" Allen's voice boomed. "Our Life Tree has revived—the crisis is over!"

Cheers erupted: "Praise the Clan Leader!"

"But the true savior isn't me." Allen's gaze found Guanyu. "Let me present our heroes!"

**Chapter 1333: Mounting Pressure**

As Guanyu and Lion Camel stepped forward, whispers swirled:

"Isn't that Lion Camel from thirty years ago?"

"Didn't he cause the previous Clan Leader's wife to die?"

Ignoring murmurs, Lion Camel addressed the crowd: "The Life Tree's restoration required both human and beastman cooperation."

A skeptic shouted: "Prove you're dragonkin!"

Guanyu's jaw tightened. Maintaining his human-dragon pretense for Amy's sake, he retorted: "The difference lies not in appearance, but essence. While humans exploit nature, dragons harmonize with it—as I've done here."

His words sparked heated debates. From the platform's edge, Locke and Kyle exchanged grim looks—their planned coup unraveling before them.
