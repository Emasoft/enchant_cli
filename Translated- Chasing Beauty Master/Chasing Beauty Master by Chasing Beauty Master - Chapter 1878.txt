“You’re absolutely right. A kind man is bullied, a tame horse is ridden—this truth remains eternal. I greatly admire Brother Wan Hong’s temperament, yet I’m even more impressed by his capabilities,” Jiang Yuankai continued. “I have an impertinent request: I wish to invite Brother Wan Hong to join my team in searching for the treasures of the Eastern Sea. Naturally, should we ever locate the treasures, we’ll divide them according to brotherly bonds. What say you?”

Jiang Yuankai’s invitation was sincere, yet Guan Yu showed no interest. The allure of the Eastern Sea’s treasures held no appeal for him, perhaps because he had never lacked wealth and thus held little regard for silver.

Guan Yu replied, “Brother Jiang, you must know I came to the capital on a mission. A master’s decree cannot be disobeyed. I fear I’ll have no time to search for treasures. Once the Eight-Sided Drum Technique surfaces, I may depart at any moment. However, should you ever require assistance, I’d gladly lend my aid.”

“Since you’re unwilling, let’s leave it at that,” Jiang Yuankai conceded. “A master’s mission must take precedence.”

As for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, Jiang Yuankai knew little beyond it being a cultivation art for immortal seekers—irrelevant to his own pursuits.

In the Qin Manor, Old Master Qin grew restless. Though Lord Cao’s final accusations before departing had been brief, they would undoubtedly bring considerable trouble to the Qin household.

“Father, why don’t we petition His Majesty directly to clarify matters? At least we wouldn’t remain so passive. Since we’re innocent, His Majesty will surely understand,” Qin Huan suggested.

“Clarify what? Rush to the emperor proclaiming our innocence? Preposterous!” Old Master Qin snapped. “Such actions would only deepen suspicion. If our conscience is clear, why explain ourselves?”

“When the court interrogates Lord Cao, he’ll surely name us as the masterminds. The fallout will be severe,” Qin Huan pressed. “Wouldn’t it be wiser to expose his motives for slandering us now?”

“We mustn’t act rashly,” the patriarch said calmly. “Even if Lord Cao persists in accusing us, evidence is required. Without proof, the Qin Clan faces minimal danger. Our priority is to sever all ties with the Caos—business connections included.

“Once the fabric shipments and fishing village goods arrive, discard them rather than sell to Cao establishments. This must be handled flawlessly.”

“Even if we wished to sell, the Caos can no longer buy,” Qin Huan countered. “After the Imperial Guards’ investigation, all Cao enterprises in the capital have been sealed. The Tang and Duan families now scramble to claim those assets.”

Old Master Qin sighed. “This is unavoidable. Normally, we should compete for Cao properties—profitable ventures all. But after that bastard Cao’s betrayal, I dare not touch them even if offered freely. Not the slightest connection can remain.”

**Chapter 4936: The Trump Card**

The Cao Clan’s capital holdings—some modest, others wildly lucrative—underwent drastic restructuring after Jiang Xin’s incident. Sealed assets would be divided among powerful players maneuvering for court connections, spending fortunes to secure future profits.

Though the Qins possessed both qualifications and resources to claim these assets, current circumstances forbade involvement. Old Master Qin resolved to seek Second Prince’s aid—after all, the prince was technically the Qin family’s son-in-law.

Meanwhile, Tang Muchen and Duan Ruxue negotiated their division of spoils. “Young Master Tang, isn’t this excessive?” Duan Ruxue demanded. “Most Cao enterprises lie in the southern districts—naturally easier for my Duan Clan to manage. Your Tangs already gain northern lumberyards and ranches. Be content!”

Though the Cao Clan’s fate remained unresolved, the two heirs bargained fiercely. The southern-based Duan Clan wanted nearby assets, while northern Tangs eyed more lucrative holdings.

“Everyone knows Cao’s northern ventures barely break even,” Tang Muchen retorted. “If we Tangs take those, you should cede two profitable ventures—their textile trade and gambling houses.”

“How shameless!” Duan Ruxue scoffed. “Compete with our renowned Duan textiles? You’d dig your own grave!”

After prolonged deadlock, Duan Ruxue deployed her ultimate weapon.

“Young Master Tang… *dear brother*…” Her voice dripped honeyed sweetness, the final syllable stretching endlessly. She fluttered near, hands clutching his shoulders. “Shouldn’t a brother indulge his sister? I *truly* desire those properties. Yield them to me, won’t you?”

Tang Muchen shuddered, intoxicated by his longtime crush’s proximity. “Of course!” he blurted. “Anything for Sister Ruxue! Take whatever you wish!”

As he reached for her hand, she deftly evaded. “Then it’s settled! No take-backs, or I’ll perish from sorrow!”

**Chapter 4937: Avarice**

“Naturally! All yours!” Tang Muchen simpered. “If Sister Ruxue spends one night with me, I’ll obey your every whim!”

He lunged clumsily. She sidestepped with practiced grace. “So impatient!” she cooed. “After matters conclude, I’m yours to command… for now, keep your word!”

Her finger tapped his forehead, sending his spirit soaring.

“Done! Absolutely done!” Tang Muchen babbled, utterly bewitched.

Duan Ruxue smiled triumphantly. *Let’s see you resist this*, she gloated internally, though repulsed by her own tactics. *Once assets transfer to Duan control, who’ll remember promises to this fool?*

Meanwhile, the Cao daughters—married into powerful families—mobilized rescue efforts. Chancellor Li’s sixth wife (Cao’s third daughter) kowtowed desperately. “Husband, save my father!”

“Fool!” Chancellor Li roared. “Even the Empress Dowager couldn’t sway His Majesty’s wrath! Your father dared plot against Princess Jiangxin—the Emperor’s treasured kin! We’re fortunate to escape implication!”

Visiting Second Prince’s estate, the Chancellor found the royal heir sunbathing, utterly detached from the crisis.

“Your Highness, might the Emperor show mercy?”

“Mercy?” The prince chuckled. “None dare plead for Caos now. Even I couldn’t gain audience today. His Majesty’s rage burns too fiercely.”

As the Chancellor paled, Second Prince added, “Though I doubt he’ll exterminate entire clans. Cao’s daughters likely survive—if they renounce all ties.”

***

**Chapter 4938: No Escape**

“None comprehend His Majesty’s protective fury,” Second Prince mused. “I wouldn’t risk offending the Princess’ household—yet Cao’s dared kidnap her? Sheer madness!”

Chancellor Li realized the disaster’s scale. If nine familial exterminations occurred, even his position might crumble.

“This transcends mere court politics,” the prince concluded. “When dragons guard their treasures, wise men keep distance. Cao’s fate rests solely on the Emperor’s mood.”

As shadows lengthened, capital players maneuvered—oblivious that in forbidden palace halls, vermilion brushes already etched death sentences for hundreds.
