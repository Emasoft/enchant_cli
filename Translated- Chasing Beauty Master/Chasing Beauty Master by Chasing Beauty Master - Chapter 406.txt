Chapter 1016: Provoking Public Fury

The sudden turn of events left everyone present stunned. After all, Elder Wang commanded immense respect, and even if Guan Yu had spoken disrespectfully, such a venerable figure should never have resorted to attacking a junior.

Yet despite all expectations, Elder Wang struck.

Having military origins, his movements were crisp and decisive. Guan Yu, who hadn't activated his detection system earlier, failed to anticipate the sudden assault. However, Lin Dong—who had been monitoring the situation—shifted slightly to block Guan Yu, intercepting the punch before countering with his own strike.

As a trained killer, Lin Dong's skills far surpassed those of the elderly Wang. His retaliatory blow sent the old man staggering back several steps.

Hu Zongze hurried forward to steady Elder Wang. "Grandpa Wang, are you alright?"

"I'm fine!" The elder waved him off, his gaze fixed intensely on Lin Dong. "Young man, impressive skills."

Lin Dong glanced at him silently. Truthfully, in pure combat terms, Elder Wang remained formidable. Even without using his supernatural abilities, Guan Yu might struggle against him. After all, the elder wouldn't have served as Hu Zongze's grandfather's bodyguard for decades without exceptional capability.

"Your techniques reek of lethal intent—far beyond ordinary martial arts," Elder Wang observed sharply. "State your origins."

The elder's keen eyes had noted how Lin Dong's strike targeted vital points, revealing this was no mere bodyguard.

"Your own skills extend beyond standard military training," Lin Dong countered flatly.

Before Elder Wang could respond, Guan Yu interjected angrily: "Old fossil! Have you no shame? Sneak-attacking a junior at your age? Does the Hu family specialize in underhanded tricks?"

The ambush infuriated Guan Yu. Had Lin Dong not intervened, that punch would have landed. While pain meant little, frightening Wen Qing beside him would've been unforgivable. Thus vanished his last shred of respect for the elder.

"You think Wen Shuquan's protection makes you untouchable?" Elder Wang's voice chilled. No one dared call him "old fossil"—this insult ignited long-dormant rage.

"You mistake me for him?" Guan Yu jabbed a finger at Hu Zongze. "Some brat hiding behind family prestige? Running home crying when slighted?"

The vicious remark shocked even bystanders. Song Qifeng emerged from the shadows, addressing both Song Shaoqin and Hu Zongze before turning to Guan Yu: "Show respect! This is Beijing!"

Guan Yu had noticed Song earlier but now realized his connections to these powerful scions. "Respect? Who here besides my friends deserves it?"

"You don't understand your position," Song Qifeng sneered. "In N City you might hold sway, but this is the capital! Here, bureau directors and billionaires crawl on their knees. What are you?"

Though initially reluctant to antagonize Li Xi, Song intervened upon seeing her poised to aid Guan Yu. He aimed to pressure Guan Yu into demonstrating Li's helplessness.

"Song Qifeng, must you reuse tired lines?" Guan Yu mocked, picking his ear. "I've heard this rubbish a hundred times. Yet here I stand unharmed."

"You'll regret this," Song threatened.

"Your regret will precede mine," Guan Yu retorted.

Song Shaoqin interjected coldly: "Enough! The Song family may not be top-tier here, but we demand justice for our assaulted member. Name your terms."

"The Jiang family," Hu Zongze added, "though no military powerhouse, holds some influence like the Wens. We'll assist Song in obtaining justice." His meaning was clear—Jiang's resources would counter Wen family protection.

"I hear you have Taiwanese ventures," Song Qifeng said menacingly. "Coincidentally, so do I. Let's see whose business expels the other."

More observers emerged, including a police commissioner's son: "If he assaulted someone, just arrest him. Why complicate matters?"

"Civilized people use legal means," another agreed.

Nearly half the hall now backed Song Shaoqin. Guan Yu's status as Wen Baoguo's prospective son-in-law paled against Song family connections.

Facing this clamor, Song Shaoqin smirked contemptuously: "Guan Yu, you're quite unpopular in Beijing."

"Who wants these degenerates' approval?" Guan Yu's dismissive words ignited fury. Lin Lin grasped the danger—antagonizing these powerful heirs risked united retaliation.

"Think the Wen family shields you from all consequences?" someone shouted.

"Our combined families outweigh theirs!"

"I'll have my grandfather petition higher authorities about Wen family collusion!"

Though most present bore Guan Yu no grudge, collective hatred now swelled as if he'd committed atrocities. Song Shaoqin's satisfaction grew.

Originally, Song's aim had been modest—extract an apology or warning. But Mu Xiyan's involvement and scant opposition emboldened him to disregard ancestral caution.

"Come with us," Song demanded. These scions operated through schemes, not brawls. A police station transfer would enable unrestricted retaliation.

Guan Yu recognized the trap but noted Song's cold-eyed companion—clearly prepared.

"He's dangerous," Lin Dong warned, sensing the man's capability.

"Planning to abduct me?" Guan Yu challenged.

"Afraid?" Song taunted. "Apologize and leave Beijing, or..."

"Afraid?" Guan Yu snorted. "I fear losing control like this afternoon—when I crippled that Song impotent."

His nose-touching gesture belied seriousness. With gravity-altering powers, he could crush skulls if provoked.

"Brave words for a dead man!" Song snarled. "Even if you defeat everyone here, escape is impossible! The Wen family can't withstand our collective might!"

"You threaten me?" Guan Yu's voice turned glacial.

"Exactly. Dare you refuse?" Song twisted his ring smugly.

"Where are you taking my husband?" Wen Qing suddenly blocked Guan Yu. "Harm him, and I'll—"

Guan Yu kissed her fiercely, enraging Hu Zongze: "Enjoy your last romantic moment! You'll soon beg for mercy!"

Ignoring him, Guan Yu addressed Song: "I'll go." Violence might let him escape, but Wen and Liu family repercussions prevented this.

Suddenly, Guan Yu slapped Hu Zongze resoundingly: "I warned I'd break your hands for touching my woman! Consider this slap a warning!"

The explosive sound froze the room. Hu Zongze—scion rivaling Song Shaoqin—publicly struck!

Elder Wang roared, charging forward, but Guan Yu materialized at Hu Zongze's throat: "Move, and I snap his neck."

Chapter 1017: Compromise

Guan Yu's fingers tightened as Elder Wang froze. The elder now truly recognized Guan Yu's unnatural speed and Lin Dong's threatening presence.

"Release him, and there may be reconciliation!"

"Spare me your lies," Guan Yu sneered. "You think I don't know what police custody entails? I came prepared. Since you've investigated me, you know my medical skills. I can leave him impotent or paralyzed—conditions only I can cure."

This wasn't bluster. With Hu Zongze hostage, he held the advantage.

"The Hu family bears you no enmity!" Elder Wang pleaded sweatily.

"Then why harass me?" The Wen-Qing conflict alone didn't justify Hu's vendetta. The Hu family's investment in Zongze's networking through prestigious clubs had been ruined by Guan Yu's exposure of counterfeit goods—a humiliation requiring retaliation.

"Release Zongze, and we withdraw from Song's affairs," Elder Wang bargained.

"Your word means nothing."

Chapter 1018: Hu Zongze's Retreat

Before Elder Wang could protest, Guan Yu's grip shifted imperceptibly. Hu Zongze's complexion purpled as choking sounds emerged.

"Stop!" Elder Wang panicked. "Name your terms!"

"First, your men retreat. Second, publicly apologize. Third, compensate my wife's mental distress."

"Impossible!" Hu Zongze croaked despite his predicament.

Guan Yu's fingers tightened. "Choose: his life or pride?"

Elder Wang swallowed hard. "We accept."

As guards withdrew, Hu Zongze uttered choked apologies. Guan Yu released him with a shove. "Remember—next time, no mercy."

The humiliated Hu faction departed hastily. Song Shaoqin's alliance crumbled like collapsing dominoes.
