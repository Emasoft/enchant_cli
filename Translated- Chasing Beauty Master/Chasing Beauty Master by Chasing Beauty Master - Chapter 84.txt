Guan Yu listened with great interest, finally grasping the general principle of this invention after prolonged attention. Since stones and jadeite possessed different thermal conductivity properties, this equipment worked by fixing the raw stone between two sides. One side slowly conducted heat through an instrument, while the other used a specialized device to receive the transmitted thermal energy. By analyzing the distribution of heat conduction data from the receiving end, they could determine whether jadeite existed within the stone.

This naturally required extremely precise data and instruments with exceptionally sensitive heat perception to achieve.

"What a stroke of genius!" Li Yunshan praised effusively.

Professor Lin smiled indifferently before carefully storing the two ruler-like instruments into his backpack.

"Director Li, to be frank, the reason I'm presenting this research is simple. Boss Du promised me 50% of the net profits from all jadeite purchases confirmed by this device." Professor Lin stated calmly, arching an eyebrow as he met Li Yunshan's gaze.

"What?" Li Yunshan blinked in surprise, casting a questioning look at Du Xueheng.

"Ahem... Director Li, Professor Lin proposed this condition, and I personally agreed. As for you and others, that's your own decision!" Du Xueheng hurriedly explained.

Li Yunshan tilted his head slightly. Fifty percent profit sharing? The money would come from his own pocket, and the device's accuracy wasn't even guaranteed. In that case...

"Let's discuss this after field testing. We'll decide when we see actual results." Li Yunshan deflected casually, mentally resolving to wait until others had trialed the device.

After casual conversation, the group sat drinking tea. Li Yunshan again engaged Guan Yu in discussion. Clearly, all hopes for their upcoming Myanmar jade-gambling venture rested on Guan Yu's shoulders.

Upon hearing Guan Yu had successfully gambled on six out of ten stones, the other jade merchants stared at the young man with burning interest.

During these exchanges, Du Xueheng approached Professor Lin. Their whispered conversation and occasional glances toward Guan Yu didn't escape notice.

Frowning slightly, Guan Yu activated his investigative skill toward Du Xueheng. The feedback revealed their plan: during the Myanmar trip, they intended to secretly compete with Guan Yu to demonstrate their new invention's superiority.

"So they want to embarrass me?" Guan Yu smirked in amusement.

Suddenly, his eyes widened. The investigative skill's collateral information about Du Xueheng's family connections left him stunned. Du Xiaojuan... Du Xueheng... This slightly portly middle-aged man was actually Du Xiaojuan's father!

Chapter 204: Premium Goods, Care to Play?

The staggering coincidence left Guan Yu gulping nervously. He drained his teacup to compose himself while Du Xueheng continued whispering with the professor.

As dusk fell and Guan Yu prepared to retire, his phone rang.

"Excuse me, I need to take this." Grabbing the device, he moved to the window.

To his shock, Du Xiaojuan's name flashed onscreen. Little did she know he'd just dined with her father.

"Hello? Senior... Yes, just finished dinner. Everything's fine... Busy day." Guan Yu wiped sweat from his brow, painfully aware of Du Xueheng's proximity.

After finally ending the call, he returned to find Niu Le drunkenly inquiring: "Your girlfriend?"

"Just a senior! Drink your tea and shut up!" Guan Yu urgently silenced his companion, fearing any mention of "Xiaojuan" would unravel everything.

"Girlfriend?" Li Yunshan teased.

"Merely a friend!" Guan Yu insisted.

"Don't kid me! That sweet-talking tone?" Du Xueheng joined the teasing.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. "What girl would want a penniless guy like me?"

"Rubbish!" Li Yunshan laughed. "You made 50 million today alone! If I had a daughter, I'd beg you to be my son-in-law!"

"Exactly!" Du Xueheng chimed. "Who wouldn't want such a profitable match?"

Guan Yu's eyes locked on Du Xueheng. "Do you have a daughter?"

The older man chuckled evasively. Later, in their room, Guan Yu briefed Niu Le about their shocking discovery.

"He's really Senior Du's dad?!" Niu Le's eyes bulged.

As they discussed future plans, their doorbell rang. Du Xueheng stood outside.

"Can't sleep?" The older man smiled. "Lao Xu arranged some 'high-end goods'. Care to join us?"

Chapter 205: What Agony!

Guan Yu stared in horror. Accompanying his potential father-in-law to a brothel? "N-no thanks!"

"Don't be shy!" Du Xueheng wheedled. "Fresh young things! Come on!"

After desperate refusals, Guan Yu finally shut the door - only for two stunning women to arrive minutes later.

"Hi handsome!" A blonde cooed, pressing against him. "Let's have fun!"

"Niu Le!" Guan Yu shouted retreating. "Your show!"

The drunken man happily embraced both women. Guan Yu slumped in a corner, chain-smoking through the erotic spectacle.

"Wash? Later!" Niu Le tossed the blonde onto bed, eagerly exploring beneath skirts. "Spread those legs..."

As lingerie flew and moans filled the air, Guan Yu groaned. What fresh hell was this?

Chapter 206: All Show, No Substance

The torture continued as Niu Le's fingers danced beneath translucent underwear. Guan Yu's jaw tightened, watching his friend's... enthusiastic exploration.

"Like this?" A woman purred, arching provocatively.

"Yeah! Now the stockings..." Niu Le's husky voice commanded.

Guan Yu's cigarette trembled. Of all the nights to play saint...
