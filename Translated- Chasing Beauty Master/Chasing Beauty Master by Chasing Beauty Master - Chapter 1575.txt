“Therefore, cultivators generally do not participate in battlefield conflicts. Of course, high-level cultivators with immense power can be quite effective if deployed, but they would only unleash one or two advanced spells before retreating. Otherwise, they’d become prime targets and face near-certain death.

**Chapter 4084: No Blame**

At this moment, Baldy could be considered a practitioner of internal energy. Judging by his mastery level, he ranked as a mid-to-lower tier warrior.

Guanyu could tell Baldy’s control over internal energy remained unrefined. His opponent, however, stood calmly with an air of composed indifference, likely viewing Baldy’s attacks as trivial and biding his time to counter.

As the crowd eagerly awaited the spectacle, Guanyu observed alongside Prince Zou’s entourage. Though the duel might lack grandeur, they expected at least a fair resolution.

Baldy’s assault was no jest—his fist whistled through the air as it slammed forward.

Just as Baldy’s strike neared its target, the unexpected occurred...

His opponent spun around and fled! Stumbling over a rock, the man rolled twice before scrambling up in panic, fleeing with terror etched across his face.

The crowd froze. Baldy, initially thinking this a evasive tactic, began pursuit but soon halted in bewilderment as the man vanished into the distance.

Guanyu chuckled dryly, shaking his head. “Well, that fellow was clearly a fraud—utterly devoid of skill, frightened into flight. Prince Zou, I suggest you stop wasting provisions on such charlatans.”

“He... just ran?” Baldy muttered incredulously.

Prince Zou sighed deeply. “Wuhui, what manner of men have you recruited? We paid substantial silver for this? Not only is he inept, but a troublemaker with the courage of a startled hare!”

“My apologies, Your Highness. This oversight is mine,” Zou Wuhui bowed.

“What’s done is done,” Guanyu interjected. “No use assigning blame—none wished this outcome. Return to formation. Let’s not delay further.”

**Chapter 4085: Vigilance**

After crossing one mountain, the group pressed onward. The next ridge presented stark contrast—two adjacent peaks separated by mere three kilometers. The rear mountain stood barren, its rocky slopes hosting only hardy weeds, while its twin flourished with dense woods sprawling into the horizon.

The caravan faced a choice: follow the winding foothill path to join the merchant route (adding considerable distance) or traverse the forested peak directly (saving time but risking ambush).

“Both routes involve wooded danger,” Prince Zou decided. “We’ll scale the mountain. Preparedness matters more than path selection.”

Guanyu noted the prince’s newfound decisiveness. As they organized the ascent, Wang Xiaorong whispered, “Old Cang, why choose the risky mountain path?”

Guanyu smiled at her tentative use of his alias. “Ambush could await either route. Our enemies likely expect the merchant road—this might outmaneuver them.”

His reasoning felt strained—shadowy observers surely tracked their movements. At the foothills rest stop, a hunter’s cart descended bearing two dead boars. Three men—one driving, two mounted—eyed the large caravan warily.

“Fifth Brother!” A guard hailed. “Fine hunt today! Those boars are massive!”

Recognitions exchanged, the hunter called Fifth Brother warned, “The mountain pass ahead’s blocked by fallen trees—impassable for carts. You’ll need the merchant route.”

Prince Zou, emerging, inquired about the obstruction. Fifth Brother explained recent storms toppled ancient trees—too巧合 for nature alone. Suspecting sabotage, Guanyu advised urgency.

“To the merchant road then,” the prince ordered. “We’ve no time to lose.”

Guanyu knew enemies awaited there—their blocked mountain path being deliberate funneling. As dusk approached, the caravan navigated treacherous cliffs flanking the narrowed merchant route.

“Double pace!” Guanyu commanded. “This terrain invites aerial assault.”

Too late. Ahead loomed boulder-blocked passage—retreat their only option. As they turned, archers materialized atop cliffs, bows drawn.

“Lay down arms!” a masked leader barked. “Noncombatants may leave unharmed!”

None fled. Guanyu roared, amplifying his voice with qi: “Fools! Our cultivators’ barriers render your arrows useless! Withdraw now or perish!”

**Chapter 4086: Scrutiny**

The bluff held—archers hesitated. Guanyu whispered to Wang Xiaorong: “Ready your wrist-crossbow. Aim for their leader.”

As she stealthily aimed, Guanyu analyzed voices. The cadence felt familiar—Yan Zhao of the Demon Soul Sect? Wang Xiaorong tensed, recognizing possible sect brethren. Exposure now risked catastrophe.

Meanwhile, the mercenaries stood firm—lured by promised riches or future royal favor. Guanyu’s earlier intimidation bought precious moments, but the cliff-edge stalemate hung by a thread...
