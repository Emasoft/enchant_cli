Feng Xihu was deeply dissatisfied with her current room, finding it far too filthy. Left with no choice, she resided in the Feng Family Patriarch's chamber, catching brief naps by his window when weary.

She had ordered servants to completely renovate the West Tower, prompting her decision to embark on a journey during the reconstruction.

Young Master Feng had initially intended to reprimand Feng Xihu upon her sobering for releasing Guan Yu—an act of grave disrespect to the Feng Family. Yet after Bierlin’s recent transgression, he dared not reproach her further.

In truth, Feng Xihu needed no external blame; she could not forgive herself. Tormented by her conflicting loyalties, she agonized over releasing Guan Yu, a decision that haunted her conscience and left her ashamed to face the Patriarch.

Had the Young Master or Patriarch chastised her, her guilt might have eased. Instead, silence compounded her anguish.

After his impulsive actions, even Bierlin recognized his rashness. Yet as a privileged scion, he deemed the matter trivial, unworthy of apology.

By morning, Feng Xihu prepared to depart, having deliberated all night. Remaining would bind her to the Patriarch’s care, but Bierlin’s growing resentment made staying untenable.

The previous evening, Bierlin had attempted to bid farewell, citing his purposelessness now that Guan Yu had escaped. Young Master Feng, aware of Bierlin’s fondness for Huaxia women, enticed him with lavish promises and exotic “toys,” ultimately persuading him to stay through decadent indulgences.

Feng Xihu’s departure relieved the Young Master, averting further friction between her and Bierlin.

In the East Tower’s Patriarch’s chamber, he insisted, “Little Sister, I’ll arrange reliable guards for your journey.”

“I need no guards,” Feng Xihu countered. “This is a secret trip. The fewer who know, the better.” Despite her refusal, he discreetly dispatched thirty bodyguards to shadow her.

With Feng Xihu gone, the Feng Family resumed operations under mounting pressure from Huaxia Group. Xu Jinglei, upon learning of Guan Yu’s ambush, nearly stormed in to “kick Young Master Feng to death” for his audacity.

Though Huaxia Group and the Bier Family had coexisted peacefully, the latter’s alliance with the Fengs dissolved all courtesy. Undaunted by the Biers’ might, Huaxia prepared for confrontation.

Overwhelmed by familial duties in the Patriarch’s illness and Feng Xihu’s absence, the Young Master groaned under the burden.

Meanwhile, Feng Xihu wandered physically free yet emotionally shackled, guilt toward both family and Guan Yu gnawing at her.

“Mr. Bierlin,” the Young Master entreated during lunch, “can you recommend capable aides? The workload is crushing me.”

Bierlin poured wine, remarking, “Busyness fortifies. With Guan Yu dormant and the Ten Thousand Year Demon Realm hidden, seize this lull to hone your commercial skills.”

The Young Master seethed inwardly—Bierlin idled in hedonism while he drowned in responsibilities. Outwardly, he smiled. “Alas, my hectic schedule hinders procuring new women for you.”

Bierlin’s eyes narrowed; the veiled threat was clear. “Our alliance targets Guan Yu,” he retorted. “I supply funds and manpower for that alone. Your domestic affairs are your own.”

Though resentful of Bierlin’s stinginess, the Young Master conceded. Bierlin added, “Huaxia assails my family too. My experts must guard our front.”

Whether truthful or not, the Young Master could only nod, yearning for Feng Xihu’s return to steady the crumbling house.

Unbeknownst to them, Guan Yu relentlessly pursued the relocated Demon Realm, vital to breaking Zhang Han’s seal and avenging past wrongs.

At dinner, Bierlin inquired, “Rumors claim the Demon Realm resurrects the dead. True?”

“A forbidden topic,” the Young Master hedged, then relented under pressure. “It’s a thumb-sized heirloom from ancestors. Its legendary power remains unproven, yet we guard it zealously.”

Bierlin’s curiosity sharpened. “Might I glimpse this relic?”

“None save my father and I have seen it—twice in my life.”

Undeterred, Bierlin masked his covetousness. Their discussion halted as a servant announced Ran Family Patriarch’s arrival.

In the parlor, the obsequious Ran Patriarch fawned over Bierlin, pledging alliance against Guan Yu. “That fiend ruined my son Ran Qiang!” he spat, slamming the table. “I’ll flay him alive!”

“Patience,” Bierlin soothed. “With our combined strength, Huaxia’s riches will be ours.”

The Ran Patriarch presented an exquisite box emitting glacial mist. Within lay a palm-sized ginseng root, its tendrils intact. “A millennium-old Snow Mountain Ginseng from Arctic depths,” he proclaimed. “It revives the dying.”

The Young Master’s eyes gleamed—not for his ailing father, but envisioning its aphrodisiac potential. Greedily accepting, he pictured nights of unflagging vigor.

As the Ran Patriarch extolled the herb’s virtues, the Young Master’s mind wandered to secret ambitions, unaware destiny’s wheels had already begun turning.
