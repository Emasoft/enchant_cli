“Why should I thank you?” Meimei asked curiously. Shuangshuang's expression kept shifting, as if wrestling with some internal dilemma, before she finally declared with resolve: “Earlier, Sister Ling’er taught me how to use the phone. I let you learn along too. Don’t you understand what I meant?”

Guanyu instantly realized—could Shuangshuang be planning to gift this iPhone to Meimei as a wedding present? Sure enough, as soon as this thought crossed his mind, Shuangshuang added: “I just wanted to play with this iPhone while I still can. When we return, I’ll give it to you as your wedding gift. That’s why I wanted you to learn how to use it too.”

Though mischievous and eccentric, Shuangshuang was known throughout the village as an obedient child. Meimei gently stroked her sister’s lovely hair and said softly, “How could I take something you cherish? Even if gifts are exchanged, it should be me giving to you, not the other way around.”

“But that’s not right! You’re getting married, and I still haven’t found a proper gift for you.”

“No gifts are needed between us. Just your presence at my wedding will make me happy.”

“No! Are you嫌弃ing the phone because I’ve used it? Then I’ll stop playing with it and put it back in the box!” Shuangshuang declared, pulling out the phone’s packaging from behind her.

Meimei stopped her. Though deeply touched by her sister’s selflessness, she refused firmly. “Shuangshuang, listen to me. If I wanted this phone, your brother-in-law would buy it for me after the wedding. You keep this one.”

“Will Brother-in-Law really buy it for you? Is he as generous as Handsome Brother? As wealthy? Would he give you such a fine gift?” For some reason, Shuangshuang kept comparing Guanyu to Meimei’s fiancé.

Ling’er shared these thoughts, though her musings went further. Not only did Meimei’s partner pale in comparison to Guanyu—every man they’d ever encountered fell short. Whether in character, possessions, or status, none could rival Guanyu.

Even with his many romantic entanglements, who could match him? His excellence was undeniable. Ling’er conceded privately: if not for his extraordinary qualities, how could so many women willingly surround him?

Meimei, momentarily stumped by Shuangshuang’s questions, pondered the same. The village chief’s daughter snickered silently, thinking: *Meimei, blame your own lack of foresight. This is heaven’s arrangement.*

Yet Meimei remained grounded. “Shuangshuang, how can you compare Guanyu to your brother-in-law? Brother Guanyu is a wealthy city man. We’re rural folk—we inhabit different worlds. Comparisons are meaningless.”

“But they’re both men! Why can’t they be compared? If it were me, I’d marry Handsome Brother. I know he’d treat me well and buy me everything I desire!” Shuangshuang insisted.

“Don’t drag me into this!” Guanyu laughed awkwardly. “Why compare me at all?”

When Shuangshuang pressed—“Why *can’t* we compare?”—Guanyu fell silent. Any response about rural versus urban differences would sound condescending.

Meimei interjected: “Your brother-in-law treats me well. Though he’s a rural man without wealth, our mutual sincerity and affection matter most.”

Chapter 227: Beyond Measure

Ling’er nodded discreetly at Meimei’s words, but the stubborn Shuangshuang persisted: “I know love requires heartfelt connection. But every woman who meets Handsome Brother would fancy him! Spend time with him, and they’d surely fall! Isn’t that true?”

Guanyu flushed, stealing a glance at his reflection. *Am I really as remarkable as she claims?*

Ling’er, torn like a reed in the wind, acknowledged Shuangshuang’s point. Guanyu’s charm was dangerously potent. She’d maintained careful distance, yet he’d already carved a place in her heart—one she refused to admit.

Were Guanyu to confess feelings or invite her to his bed, Ling’er knew she’d acquiesce. She lacked both reason and will to refuse him anything.

The chief’s daughter, fearing Meimei might develop interest in Guanyu, cut in: “Shuangshuang! Your sister marries tomorrow—are you trying to sabotage this?”

“Ugh! You know that’s not my meaning!” Shuangshuang huffed. Everyone understood her innocence; the chief’s daughter merely schemed to reduce rivals for Guanyu’s attention.

“Handsome Brother,” Shuangshuang suddenly proclaimed, “you never answered me earlier—why not marry me? I’d treat you well and bear many children!”

Before others could react, the chief’s daughter spat: “Shameless! How can a girl your age speak so?”

“I’ll marry him if I want! What’s it to you?” Shuangshuang retorted, hands on hips, ready for battle.

“Enough, Shuangshuang,” Meimei chided.

Guanyu dodged the proposal artfully: “Shuangshuang, keep the phone I gave you. When we reach town, I’ll buy another for Meimei’s gift. Agreed?”

Before Shuangshuang could respond, Meimei protested: “No need, Brother Guanyu! Don’t spend more on my account!”

“Choose: accept Shuangshuang’s cherished gift, or let me buy a new one?” Guanyu’s dilemma silenced Meimei. Taking the phone would sadden Shuangshuang; allowing purchase meant imposing further on Guanyu’s generosity.

Meimei glanced pleadingly at Ling’er, who shrugged: “Let him. His wealth is bottomless—this sum is less than he spends on Zhang Han’s snacks.”

“Still, we’ve burdened him enough today...”

“Which is why I should marry him!” Shuangshuang interjected. “Then we’d spend his money properly!”

Guanyu chuckled. “Marriage aside, feel free to spend my money. I’ll never complain.”

The chief’s daughter, feeling excluded, wheedled: “Handsome Brother, get me an iPhone too!”

Though disliking the girl, Shuangshuang held her tongue. Guanyu agreed readily: “Of course. Everyone gets one in town.”

As they entered the county seat, Shuangshuang directed Guanyu to a pharmacy near her school. Alighting, two classmates spotted her.

“Shuangshuang! Weren’t you on wedding leave? Whose Bentley is this? Your brother-in-law’s?”

“Handsome Brother’s car,” Shuangshuang beamed. “My brother-in-law could never afford this!”

The boy, recognizing the luxury emblem, gushed: “A ‘Brother’? That title’s not casual! Your future’s bright, Shuangshuang!”

Chapter 228: Shameless

The girl, noticing her boyfriend’s sudden interest in Shuangshuang, erupted: “Liu! You money-grubbing rat! After dragging me to that motel, now you drool over her?”

Liu, desperate to save face before Shuangshuang, turned on his lover: “Shut your filthy mouth! Who are you to interfere?”

The girl cursed his inadequacies before storming off. Liu, undeterred by humiliation, simpered: “Shuangshuang, let me treat you to dinner!”

As he pressed closer, Meimei shot Guanyu a look. Seizing Liu’s shoulder, Guanyu’s grip drew a porcine squeal.

“This is your only warning,” Guanyu growled. “Stay away from Shuangshuang forever.” To emphasize, he kicked a nearby stone slab into powder. “Defy me, and you’ll share its fate.”

Liu crumpled, begging: “I’ll stay far away! Mercy, please!”

Guanyu released him with disgust. The shameless suitor scrambled off, his pretensions shattered like the rubble at their feet.
