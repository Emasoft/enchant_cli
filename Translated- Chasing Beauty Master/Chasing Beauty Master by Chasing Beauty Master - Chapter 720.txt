Guan Yu declared, “If Han Qiao won’t compensate for these broken vases and flowers, I’ll take responsibility.” Yet many of these shattered items were irreplaceable antiques centuries old, some possibly one-of-a-kind in the world. As for the flowers cultivated by Miss Yang, they were cherished beyond measure—and their owner had no need for monetary compensation.

Hou Jinshun’s head throbbed with anxiety. Everyone present, including Wei Hongwei, understood the gravity of the situation. Han Qiao sat silently, stewing in dread. *Perhaps Miss Yang will exile me from City A,* he thought.

Indeed, all patrons of the Flower Night Club feared Yang Conghan (From the Cold)—not due to any personal ferocity, but because her peerless beauty commanded universal reverence, and her status rendered her untouchable. Wealthy heirs dreaded crossing her, for incurring her displeasure meant becoming a pariah.

To offend Yang Conghan was to invite the wrath of City A’s most influential. This was the source of her formidable power.

Unfazed, Guan Yu eyed Hou Jinshun’s despondent expression. “What’s there to fear? You’re a grown man—losing a job isn’t the end of the world. So what if things broke? At worst, you’ll find new work. Why mope like this?”

Hou Jinshun sighed. “You don’t understand. No one in City A dares slight Miss Yang. This isn’t just about a job. Crossing her turns you into a public enemy. I’ll be ostracized—my life here ruined.”

Guan Yu scoffed. “Nonsense. She’s just a pretty-faced girl. How much power could she wield?”

The moment these words left his lips, Hou Jinshun paled. *You might fear nothing, Guan Yu, but I lack your audacity!*

Every gaze in the room sharpened toward Guan Yu, hostility simmering in their eyes. *So Yang Conghan’s allure truly commands such loyalty,* he mused. *I must see this woman for myself—what makes her so formidable?*

Hou Jinshun tugged at Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Let’s flee now—leave City A before it’s too late!”

“Why should I run? I didn’t break anything. Even if I had, would she devour me?” Guan Yu retorted loudly.

“This young lady would like to see whether she can indeed ‘eat’ you.”

A voice like celestial music rang out, electrifying the room. Hou Jinshun froze. *Of all times for her to appear!*

Wei Hongwei’s eyes widened as he turned toward the sound.

Guan Yu’s mind buzzed. *Such a melodious voice—enough to conjure fantasies. Its owner must be extraordinary.* His gaze lifted to the second floor.

There stood a goddess—no less. The club’s glass-and-steel architecture transformed her surroundings into an aquatic dream. Schools of fish swirled toward her through transparent walls, gathering beneath her feet in a mesmerizing dance. Even Guan Yu stared, awestruck.

Clad in a sky-blue dress that accentuated her flawless figure, Yang Conghan possessed breathtaking beauty—yet her expression chilled like winter frost.

*No wonder men kneel at her feet,* Guan Yu realized. *Such looks alone explain her influence.*

Noticing familiar blossoms embroidered on her hem, he glanced at the shattered flowerpot nearby. *The same flowers. She must adore them obsessively—a woman of strong whims.*

As Yang Conghan descended, the fish dispersed—clearly another of her cherished companions. *No wonder she’s icy toward humans,* Guan Yu thought. *She prefers flora and fauna.*

While others ogled Yang Conghan, Guan Yu studied the fish—until her gaze pinned him.

*This stranger ignores me for fish?* Her lips tightened. *Am I invisible?*

Truthfully, Guan Yu longed to admire her beauty but found the aquatic phenomenon more intriguing. Behind him, Wei Hongwei drooled openly until Guan Yu elbowed him—to no effect. A sharp slap finally roused the dazed man.

“Who hit me?” Wei Hongwei mumbled.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Didn’t see anything.”

A girl behind Yang Conghan stifled a laugh—a lovely attendant overshadowed by her mistress’ radiance.

As Yang Conghan approached, Hou Jinshun fidgeted like a scalded monkey. Guan Yu steadied him. “I’ll handle this.”

The attendant, Jin Hua (Golden Flower), flushed upon seeing Guan Yu. *So handsome—and immune to Miss Yang’s charm!* Her heart fluttered.

Surveying the wrecked hall, Yang Conghan’s voice frosted the air. “First time here?”

Hou Jinshun quivered. “M-Miss Yang, this is Guan Yu. His inaugural visit.”

“City A’s reigning beauty lives up to her fame,” Guan Yu remarked.

Yang Conghan’s lips curled faintly in disdain. *Typical man.*

“I’ll compensate for the damages,” Guan Yu offered.

Jin Hua interjected, “Your life isn’t worth these flowers! Some are priceless!”

“Then name your price,” Guan Yu countered.

“Miss Yang lacks nothing,” Jin Hua mused. “Unless… you offer yourself.”

The room collectively gasped. *Destroying vases earns Yang Conghan’s hand? We’d have demolished this place years ago!*

Yang Conghan flushed. “Enough, Jin Hua.”

Seizing an opening, Guan Yu gestured around. “This club’s feng shui is flawed. The layout hoards wealth but stifles human connections. You’ve few friends, yes?”

Hou Jinshun vouched, “Guan Yu’s my benefactor. Hear him out.”

Yang Conghan paused. Apart from Jin Hua, she indeed had no companions—and her father’s lonely existence mirrored her own.

“Without rectifying the feng shui,” Guan Yu pressed, “you’ll die alone, your fortune orphaned. Your father seeks companionship but finds none—am I wrong?”

Yang Conghan stiffened. Her mother died in childbirth; her father’s later lover perished tragically. Guan Yu’s words struck deep.

Jin Hua suggested, “Let’s discuss this upstairs.”

To the crowd’s shock, Yang Conghan led Guan Yu to the forbidden third floor—a cerulean sanctuary where fish swam beneath glass floors.

As they settled in her office, envious whispers erupted below:

“Who knew wrecking vases was the way to her heart?”

“Should’ve studied feng shui!”

In her aquatic-themed chamber, Guan Yu marveled at one-way glass walls. “Why did the fish flock to you earlier?”

Yang Conghan sipped tea. “They’re… sensitive to presence.”

Meanwhile, downstairs patrons wallowed in regret. *A chance to speak with her—wasted!*
