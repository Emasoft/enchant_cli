“Damn it, why bring up that sore subject? I gave it to your sister-in-law Xue Jing,” Guan Yu retorted with a laugh.

“By the way, Brother Guan, the A City Intercollegiate Taekwondo Championship is happening in a month. Aren’t you joining? If you participate, our Kaihuang Academy is guaranteed to win this year.”

“I’m not interested in rankings,” Guan Yu replied curtly, ending the conversation.

The upcoming Taekwondo Championship had garnered immense attention across A City. Every academy prioritized the event, as its outcome could significantly influence their public reputation. Wei Hongwei had hoped to see Guan Yu dominate the competition but now realized it was unlikely.

With over a dozen academies in A City, each had already begun internal trials to select their top three competitors for the city-wide tournament. Winning the championship was every taekwondo enthusiast’s dream.

Wei Hongwei, undeterred, leaned closer to Guan Yu. “Last year’s champion was Yin Qiu from Lianying Academy. His skills were transcendental—everyone admitted defeat. He’s practically unbeaten across A City, even nationally. No one doesn’t know his name.”

“How good is he, really?” Guan Yu asked curiously.

“Well… this year’s title will probably go to him again. But if *you* joined, he’d be stuck in second place!” Wei Hongwei enthused, saliva flying as he emphasized the thrilling matches and lavish prizes. Despite his efforts, Guan Yu remained unmoved, frustrating Wei Hongwei to no end.

As the weekend approached, Wei Hongwei suggested a night out at Mike’s Karaoke Bar. Guan Yu agreed without hesitation.

After school, Guan Yu and Xue Jing walked ahead, opting to ride in Wei Hongwei’s car instead of driving separately.

Mike’s was A City’s most luxurious karaoke venue, its opulent decor and premium services matched by exorbitant prices—even a basic bottled water cost fifty yuan. Patrons here were either wealthy or influential.

Upon arrival, a woman in a red qipao greeted them warmly. “Welcome to Mike’s. Please follow me.”

Led to a pre-booked VIP room, Jia Bo marveled at the palace-like decor, privately noting he could never afford such extravagance. “It’s true what they say—relying on friends pays off,” he muttered.

Xue Jing remarked casually, “This is nice. My first time here with you.”

“If you like it, we’ll come more often. After all, *you’re* footing the bill,” Guan Yu teased, striding in. Xue Jing stuck out her tongue playfully, thinking, *“This isn’t my money—it’s all from your wife, the boss!”*

Once settled, Wei Hongwei boomed, “Bring us a few bottles of 1980 ‘Aunt Flo’—the purest kind!” A server nodded politely.

Xue Jing smirked. “Oh? Our ‘Big Brother Wei’ needs ‘Aunt Flo’ to stay healthy? Girlfriend wearing you out? This place charges too much—I’ve got some leftovers below. Want a sip?”

The group burst into laughter. “Aunt Flo” was industry slang for red wine, likened to menstrual cycles due to its color and enthusiasts’ monthly cravings.

Their merriment shattered as a brash voice roared outside: “Who the hell took my presidential suite? Bold move!”

Guan Yu sighed. *Trouble again.* A bald, round-faced fat man swaggered in, flanked by four black-suited bodyguards. Reeking of alcohol, the man leered at Xue Jing, his eyes roaming her body.

“What a babe! Those tits, that ass—I’m keeping you tonight. Your friends can have the room,” he slurred, reaching for her.

Guan Yu yanked Xue Jing back as servers arrived with wine. “Server, bring the bottles here,” he ordered.

When the server approached, Guan Yu snatched a bottle and smashed it over the fat man’s head. Blood and wine sprayed as the man howled. The server recoiled in terror.

“Come here,” Guan Yu commanded calmly. Trembling, she obeyed. He seized another bottle and cracked it across a bodyguard’s skull.

**Chapter 1794: Smashing Eggs**

As three guards charged, Guan Yu sneered, “Arrogant.” Before he could strike, a blur darted past—Xue Jing.

She kicked one guard’s groin, sending him flying. A nearby server winced in sympathy. Grabbing another’s throat, she yanked upward, seizing his crotch with her free hand. The man trembled silently, agony rendering him mute.

The last guard lunged, only to be kicked into a wall. Xue Jing stomped his groin, grinding her heel. The room froze.

“Holy shit… Sister-in-law’s not just skilled—she’s ruthless! Never piss her off,” Wei Hongwei croaked, clutching his own groin.

Wang Xiaoqian remarked flatly, “If you ever betray me, I’ll ask Xue Jing to handle you.”

“N-never!” he stammered.

Guan Yu eyed Wang Xiaoqian warily. Most girls would’ve fled in terror, yet she stood unfazed—unnatural. Earlier, his试探 qi attack had vanished into her like a stone sinking in sea. This “rescue” from harassment reeked of setup.

*Coincidence? No. She’s hiding something.*

Xue Jing loomed over the writhing fat man. “Mess with me? Tired of carrying those balls?” She stomped his face, embedding glass shards into his flesh.

Security stormed in, hauling the man away. One guard barked, “You’re dead! That was our chairman’s brother’s sister-in-law’s friend!”

“F*ck your family tree!” Guan Yu slapped him spinning.

The manager burst in with reinforcements. “Who dares cause trouble here? Attack!”

Xue Jing plopped onto a couch. “I’m tired. Your turn.”

Guan Yu dove into the fray, fists and feet flying. Bodies piled up as he carved toward the manager, now trembling. “I’m North Mountain Gang! Cross us, and—”

“North Mountain Gang?” Guan Yu feigned awe before laughing. “Never heard of ’em. I’m South Mountain Sect!”

Enraged, the manager summoned over a hundred thugs. Guan Yu assessed the odds—he and Xue Jing could fight, but protecting Wei Hongwei, Wang Xiaoqian, and Jia Bo was risky.

“Can you handle this alone?” Xue Jing asked, eyes stinging from fire extinguisher powder.

“Go. Watch them—especially *her*,” Guan Yu nodded toward Wang Xiaoqian.

**Chapter 1795: How Do You Want to Die?**

Xue Jing gave a thumbs-up. Guan Yu trusted her prowess.

The manager, emboldened by numbers, yelled, “Kill them all!”

Guan Yu became a whirlwind of violence, his blade painting the room red. Adrenaline burned through him, eyes crimson, features twisted. Bodies fell, but more kept coming.

Spotting Xue Jing struggling with impaired vision, Guan Yu carved a path to her. “Take their leader hostage!” he urged, but the manager had fled.

Exhausted yet exhilarated, Guan Yu panted amidst the carnage. The manager’s voice echoed: “10k per cut on him!”

Guan Yu tossed his blade. “Negotiate? *I’m* offering *you* mercy. Bring water now, or none of you see dawn.”

His aura erupted, suffocating the room with dread. The manager paled but blustered, “You’re dead!”

Guan Yu smirked. The true battle had just begun.
