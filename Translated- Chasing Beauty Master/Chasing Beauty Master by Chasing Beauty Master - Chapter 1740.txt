No one had expected that their entry here was only permitted because Guan Yu had paid silver. It was clear this host was extraordinary—demanding payment at such a critical juncture was nothing short of opportunism. Partnership was out of the question.

After hearing Xiao Mei’s words, everyone fell silent. The man who had earlier pointed accusingly at Guan Yu now said nothing. Though anxious about his missing younger brother, he feared provoking Xiao Mei further, knowing expulsion would leave them stranded.

Of the remaining three—one from Bamboo Forest Peak, the others unfamiliar to Guan Yu—their chances of survival seemed bleak.

At the final moment, as the gale tore through their tent, those three had failed to reach shelter before the entire structure was ripped away, vanishing with the storm.

To steady the group, Guan Yu said, “Don’t panic. This tent has been reinforced and remains secure for now.”

Though the tempest raged outside, destroying other tents, theirs held firm—for the moment.

Yet gloom weighed heavily. No one knew how long the shelter would last. A senior brother demanded, “Guan Yu, why did you stop us from casting protective spells earlier? Had we acted, those three might still be here!”

Hearing the accusation, Guan Yu explained swiftly, “You saw the storm’s fury. Even combined, our shields would’ve shattered quickly, wasting spiritual power. Without this refuge, we’d all be lost. How long could your reserves last?”

Silence followed. His words rang true—no spell could withstand such violence.

Wang Jun spoke up: “Guan Yu, we owe you our lives. Had you not acted decisively, none of us would’ve survived.”

Though some still harbored resentment, Wang Jun’s defense was justified. Without Guan Yu’s quick thinking—securing ropes and rallying them—many more would have perished. Xiao Mei lounged indifferently, unconcerned with their plight.

Her tent, now crowded, irked her. Yet silver had bought their stay. She knew, however, prolonged storms would doom even this shelter.

A sudden *crack* startled the group. Eyes darted, but the tent showed no damage.

“Stay calm,” Guan Yu urged. “If the tent fails, channel spiritual power into personal shields. That’s our best hope.”

“If it collapses, we’re finished!” a panicked disciple cried.

“Follow my instructions, and we’ll endure,” Guan Yu insisted. “Gather close. Shared shields conserve energy. Survive this, and we succeed.”

A Ze joined in reassurance: “We knew risks when we came. This tent’s sturdy—it’ll hold.”

Wang Jun added, “Stay prepared. Even exposed, linked together, our shields can resist the wind.”

Guan Yu cleared the central area, suggesting, “Tie yourselves with ropes. Safety lies in unity.”

No objections arose. Xiao Mei watched their frantic preparations with amusement, unafraid of the storm’s wrath.

“Mind my table,” she warned.

Guan Yu sighed. “The tent itself may fly away, yet you fret over furniture?”

“It’s intact *now*,” she retorted. “Your silver buys shelter, not vandalism.”

He chose silence. Others quietly thanked him—without his silver, they’d have no refuge.

Regret lingered. Had they stayed in the Hazu tribe’s fortified towers, they’d be safe.

Wang Jun asked suddenly, “What of the camels?”

A Ze scowled. “Worry for yourself! The camels are tethered, but who knows their fate?”

Guan Yu suspected the camels lost. Yet lives mattered more—camels could be replaced through Xiao Mei or the Hazu. Without them, they’d trek using plank-shoes. But tents and supplies were likely gone, complicating their journey.

Survival first. Shelter could be addressed later.

Siqi leaned against Guan Yu, gripping the rope. He whispered, “Stay calm. I’ll shield you if needed.”

She nodded, trusting his heightened cultivation.

Another *crack* echoed—tent fabric warping under windstress. Hearts pounded.

A Ze urged, “Ready your artifacts!”

“Siqi and I will cast a group shield first,” Guan Yu assured. “Then reinforce individually. We’ll endure.”

Wang Jian eyed their artifacts—Guan Yu’s Soulfall Blade and Siqi’s Jade Ruyi—with relief. “That eases my mind,” he said.

Xiao Mei sneered at their terror. “Pathetic. Such fear over a little storm?”

Wang Jun retorted, “Snakes burrow into sand. *We* lack that luxury.”

“Care to leave?” she hissed.

“You took silver. We stay,” he shot back.

“Silver?” She smirked. “I could return it and expel you. My tent, my rules.”

Another disciple snapped, “Our brothers are missing! Show some decency!”

Guan Yu intervened, “Enough! Save your strength. Survival matters now.”

Xiao Mei relented, storing her grudges for later. Outside, a monstrous tornado approached—a twisting black pillar devouring the desert.

The tent groaned. Xiao Mei tapped her bed, signaling her sister—a large yellow snake—to prepare. “We’re leaving,” she told Guan Yu. “This place won’t hold.”

“Where’ll you go?” he asked.

“Safer grounds,” she replied, vanishing into the storm.

Wang Jun frowned. “Why not take us?”

“She’d refuse,” Guan Yu said. “Focus on—”

A roar cut him off. The tent’s roof tore away, unleashing chaos.

Eyes squinting, Guan Yu glimpsed the looming tornado. “Shields now!” he yelled, activating a group barrier with Soulfall Blade.

The tent vanished, leaving only the central post. Huddled together, they layered shields—Siqi’s glowed brightest, repelling rain and wind.

Guan Yu bolstered Wang Jun’s faltering defenses. A Ze held firm. The tornado advanced, its fury inescapable.

Survival hung by a thread.
