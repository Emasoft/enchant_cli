“Just talking shouldn’t cost a whole gold leaf, so there’s no choice. If you want to chat, you’ll have to owe me. Right now, Xiao Zhi genuinely can’t produce five taels of silver.”

“Owing is fine, but when will you repay?” Wang Jun rode his horse back and said, “Do you know debts accrue interest?”

“Interest?” Xiao Zhi looked at Wang Jun curiously. “What foreign term is that now?”

“You imbecile. You know nothing.” Wang Jun said impatiently, “Interest means profit. If you owe me money, I charge extra. For example, if you repay those five taels tomorrow, you’ll owe six. Each day adds another tael. The day after would be seven. Understand?”

“Holy shit! Why not just rob me? Since when do prices inflate like this?” Xiao Zhi glared disdainfully.

“I don’t care. I’ve already spent five taels’ worth of time chatting with you. Pay up!”

Xiao Zhi widened his eyes. “What nonsense! You haven’t told me anything yet! We haven’t even started talking, and you’re demanding silver? Are you mad?”

“You’re the mad one!” Wang Jun retorted. “Everything I just said counts. You think anyone else would waste breath on you?”

Xiao Zhi was too infuriated to reply, never expecting such pettiness. Inside the carriage, Prince Zou clearly overheard their banter. Despite the perilous circumstances, these two still joked around, utterly unperturbed. Gradually, the prince’s tension eased.

Throughout this journey, anxiety had dominated, leaving no room for levity. Yet listening to Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi’s laughter, Prince Zou found it oddly amusing—Xiao Zhi’s simple honesty contrasting sharply with Wang Jun’s shrewdness.

**Chapter 4040: Rejoining the Team**

Xiao Zhi’s furious glare burned into Wang Jun. “I’m baffled. How did I never notice your stinginess before? And this calculating pettiness!”

Wang Jun snorted. “You’ve never walked in my shoes. Survive my hardships, and you’d count coins tighter than I. When you’re poor, stinginess keeps you alive.”

Conversation made the journey swift. Unnoticed, they reached the mountain’s base. Guanyu alerted everyone: “Stay vigilant. No carelessness.”

Approaching the carriage, he asked, “Have any scouts returned from the four directions?”

Zou Wuhui shook his head uneasily. “None. I don’t know why.”

“Impossible.” Guanyu’s face tightened. They’d descended the mountain in nearly an hour—plenty of time for scouts to return. Even if ambushed, all four routes couldn’t have been compromised.

After a pause, Guanyu said, “Wait longer. Perhaps they traveled farther. Let’s give them time.”

Zou Wuhui nodded. “No other choice.”

“Forget speculation,” interjected Zou Wuxiao. “Speed toward Ao Tian Manor. Safety lies there.”

Even a child would suggest this, but reaching Ao Tian Manor wasn’t simple unless Guanyu’s group flew Prince Zou there—an impossibility without exposing their ability to levitate. Thus, they trudged onward. Earlier scouts sent to the manor had likely been killed en route, explaining the silence.

“Riders approaching!” Wang Jun shouted from the rear, where he and Xiao Zhi kept watch.

Guanyu turned to see two soldiers sprinting from the east. Gasping, they reported, “Sir! We found nothing but a wild boar. Had to climb trees to escape. No other threats.”

“Rejoin the ranks,” Zou Wuhui ordered grimly.

The group’s mood darkened. Though the boar encounter was comical, no one laughed.

Guanyu analyzed, “The other three scouts are likely dead. At least the forward teams are.”

“Why assume the worst? Delays happen,” Zou Wuxiao argued weakly.

“Front scouts should’ve returned first. They’ve been gone nearly two hours—double the allotted time. Enemies likely ambushed all three directions.”

Zou Wuhui asked, “Master Cang, what now?”

“Advance as planned. When attacked, Prince Zou flees on horseback. I’ll clear the path. Zou Wuhui guards him. My disciples will cover the rear. Zou Wuxiao diverts pursuers with the carriage.”

This strategy relied on Zou Wuxiao as decoy—a perilous role.

“Enemies outnumber us. No heroics—flee immediately. Forgive the hardship, Your Highness.” Guanyu bowed.

Prince Zou coughed lightly. “Necessary evils. Better hardship than death.” His chuckle held bitter resignation.

“More approaching!” Wang Jun warned. Distant footsteps echoed—two breathless scouts from the west.

Zou Wuhui demanded, “Why the delay? You were ordered back within half an hour!”

“Ambushed, sir!” one panted. “They meant to kill us, but a youth in their ranks spared us... to deliver a message.”

“Speak freely,” Guanyu urged.

Trembling, the scout stammered, “They said... surrender Prince Zou’s head... or we all die.”

Zou Wuhui’s fist clenched. “Where are they? Numbers?”

“Twenty masked archers in black. We saw no more.”

Guanyu nodded. “They’re west—our right flank. Press onward.”

Prince Zou paled. “Make haste to Ao Tian Manor.”

Guanyu suspected these weren’t martial artists—trained archers suggested imperial troops or disguised guards. As the group advanced, he warned Wang Jun: “If overwhelmed, you and Xiao Zhi flee with the prince. I’ll hold them off. Use levitation only as last resort.”

“Understood. But if you’re outmatched—run!”

Suddenly, Zou Wuhui halted the convoy. Ahead stood a black-clad blockade.

“Why stop?” Prince Zou asked.

“The road is barred, Your Highness,” Zou Wuhui replied.

Guanyu cautioned, “Don’t reveal yourself. They’ve studied our numbers. Stick to the plan.”

Two masked riders approached. “Surrender Prince Zou, and the rest may leave,” one growled through an altered voice.

Zou Wuhui barked, “Insolence! This is treason!”

“Spare the threats,” the leader sneered. “Your pathetic guards can’t stop us.”

“Enough chatter!” His companion drew a blade. “Kill them all.”

**Chapter 4042: Carnage Unleashed**

Guanyu whispered to Wang Jun: “At the critical moment, take the prince and go. Don’t look back.”

“But you—”

“I’ll manage. Just protect him.”

The enemies charged. Guanyu’s sword flashed, parrying arrows. Chaos erupted as the convoy scattered. True to plan, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi flanked the prince’s horse, cutting through the fray. Behind them, Guanyu became a whirlwind of steel—every stroke precise, every counter lethal. Bodies fell, yet more replaced them.

Zou Wuxiao’s carriage veered east, drawing pursuers. Arrows thudded into wood as soldiers fell. Through the din, Prince Zou’s face hardened—a ruler confronting mortality.

“Faster!” Wang Jun urged, dodging a spear. Xiao Zhi’s axe cleaved an attacker. Ahead, the forest thinned—Ao Tian Manor’s lights glimmered distantly. Hope flared.

Yet shadows surged anew. From the treeline, a fresh wave emerged—archers nocking flaming arrows. Guanyu cursed. Traps within traps.

“Now!” he roared.

Wang Jun hesitated, then spurred his horse. As flames lit the night, Guanyu’s blade danced brighter—a lone sentinel against the tide.
