The group swiftly arrived at Qianhui Peak as evening descended. Guan Yu and his companions entered the main hall first, where Chief Lu had been waiting since hearing of their return.

“Greetings, Uncle Lu,” they chorused upon entering.

Chief Lu rose from his seat with a warm smile. “You’ve returned! The Sect Leader instructed you to report directly to Tigerhead Peak. But would you like to rest here first?”

After a brief consideration, Guan Yu replied, “We’ll head to Tigerhead Peak now. Will you join us, Uncle Lu?”

“Of course,” Chief Lu said. “The other chiefs are already waiting there. Let’s depart if you’re ready.”

As they crossed Wuliang Bridge, Chief Lu inquired, “How did your mission fare? Any major developments?”

“Nothing significant,” Guan Yu answered. “We merely gained deeper insight into the Demonic Sect’s activities.”

Upon reaching Tigerhead Peak’s grand hall, they found all Yunqing Sect chiefs assembled. Sect Leader Xuan Ming sat centrally, flanked by the other chiefs.

After formal greetings, Xuan Ming addressed Guan Yu: “Chief Zheng briefed me. The ruins beneath Duobao Mountain held Meng Hua’s remains but no trace of the Eight-Drum Technique. Is this accurate?”

“Yes, Master,” Guan Yu replied. “We faced a millennium-old beast guarding the site and barely escaped with our lives. Upon reaching Meng Hua’s crypt, the Blazing Heaven Furnace opened its gates. Inside lay only his skeleton and this cloth inscribed with demonic script.” He presented the fabric to Xuan Ming. “It supposedly hints at the technique’s location, but the symbols elude me.”

Xuan Ming examined the cloth before passing it to Chief Zheng. “Rumors claim you’ve mastered the Eight-Drum Technique. The Demonic Soul Sect spreads this tale. Truth or falsehood?”

“Utter falsehood!” Guan Yu declared. “As a righteous disciple of Yunqing, I’d never dabble in demonic arts—even for peerless techniques. I beg your fair judgment.”

Xuan Ming summoned a radiant scale fragment. “This sacred beast’s scale verifies spiritual purity. Resist not.”

Though outwardly compliant, Guan Yu inwardly panicked as white light enveloped him. The scale’s glow remained untainted, drawing sighs of relief.

“See?” Xuan Ming proclaimed. “No corruption taints him. The rumors are demonic slander to smear our sect!”

Chief Lu voiced support: “I always trusted Guan Yu’s integrity!”

Yet Chief Xiang of Zuokong Peak remained skeptical. “What if the scale failed? Or he concealed the taint?”

Guan Yu shot him a frigid glare, suspecting the chief might be a demonic infiltrator.

To settle doubts, Xuan Ming tested the cloth. The scale darkened upon contact. “Meng Hua’s bloodstains reek of demonic energy. This proves the scale’s efficacy—and Guan Yu’s innocence.”

When Guan Yu produced the Blazing Heaven Furnace, the scale’s black radiance intensified, silencing dissenters.

Xuan Ming nodded. “Though demonic, tools aren’t inherently evil—only their wielders. This furnace’s role as a crypt key was unforeseen.”

As Guan Yu recounted their ordeal—demonic factions clashing beneath Duobao Mountain, the submerged beast, and the cryptic lake—Chief Zheng interjected with concern for his nephew Xiao Zhi’s family. Reassured of their safety, the chiefs pressed for details.

Guan Yu omitted Wang Xiaorong’s involvement and certain specifics, wary of listeners. “We regained consciousness ashore after the lake’s turmoil, the crypt already collapsed behind us.”

When Chief Zheng deciphered the cloth’s message—“Beneath Golden City, Upon Divine Stone Mountain, When Blossoms Bloom and Fragrance Spreads, The Divine Art Emerges”—Guan Yu urged secrecy, fearing leaks to demonic spies.

Xuan Ming dismissed concerns of traitorous chiefs, rebuking Guan Yu: “Never question your seniors without proof!”

The meeting concluded with the cloth entrusted to Xuan Ming. Privately, Guan Yu warned of high-ranking infiltrators, but the sect leader refused to entertain doubts about his inner circle.

As night fell, the disciples withdrew, the cryptic prophecy hanging unresolved—a ticking shadow over Yunqing Sect’s future.
