“Yes, not fully recovered yet! But… the crux is, from a medical perspective, this is a resurrection effect, you understand? A completely necrotic, damaged kidney has regained vitality. Late-stage uremia—the patient would have fallen into a coma within days. Now it’s reversed!” The hospital dean spoke gruffly, his tone defensive.

“Exactly… Lao Zhang, you grasp my thoughts! If possible, I’ll observe the situation here. If this young man practicing qigong therapy can truly cure this uremia patient, I’ll arrange for him to treat another chronic case. If both prove effective, you see… this pipeline, you must…”

“Alright, I’ll thank you in advance!” The dean’s face instantly brightened, though unclear what response he received. His expression suggested deep satisfaction.

After exchanging pleasantries, the dean hung up.

*Hmm… Understanding this young man remains the priority.* The dean nodded slowly, lost in thought.

As he pondered the mechanisms of qigong therapy, the stern-faced middle-aged doctor from earlier knocked urgently and barged in.

“Dean! The young man just arrived—he’s in the patient’s room right now!” The doctor spoke rapidly.

Though initially dismissive of Guan Yu’s qigong methods and openly mocking, the tangible results now silenced his skepticism. Successfully treating Mother Luo’s chronic condition would mark a groundbreaking medical event.

As a physician, he understood the implications: if Guan Yu truly cured Mother Luo, it would redefine current medical understanding of late-stage uremia.

**Chapter 154: What Must I Prove?**

Unaware of the hospital’s sudden focus on him, Guan Yu sat chatting casually with Mother Luo’s family.

Upon learning the qigong practitioner had returned, the dean rushed to the ward with several specialists.

The door swung open. The dean entered flanked by doctors and an external consultant.

“Dean’s here! Please sit—” A family member, likely acquainted with the dean, stood eagerly, assuming this was a routine visit.

“How are you feeling today?” A doctor smiled, then shifted his gaze to Mother Luo’s bed, eyeing her companions suspiciously.

After brief exchanges, the dean stepped forward. “I’ve heard a young man is treating you with qigong. Which one is he?”

Guan Yu frowned. *Another interrogation?*

“Me.” Guan Yu stepped forward as Luo Cheng glanced at him.

“Ah, greetings. I’m Dean Yu of this hospital.”

“Hello.” Guan Yu nodded curtly, hands clasped behind his back.

The dean’s brow twitched at Guan Yu’s nonchalance. “Your qigong therapy shows remarkable preliminary results. I’d like to understand its mechanisms. Would you discuss this in my office?”

“No time today. Perhaps another day.” Guan Yu’s reply was cool.

The dean blinked, unprepared for refusal. “This won’t take long. As her caregivers, we must evaluate all treatments. Cooperation benefits everyone.”

“Unnecessary. My methods involve acupoint stimulation—no conflict with your protocols.”

*Is he obtuse or feigning ignorance?* The dean forced a smile. “Your results surpass our pharmaceuticals. Impressive work!”

Guan Yu smirked silently. *Why would hospital brass suddenly praise me? There’s an agenda here.*

“While effective here,” the dean pressed, “have you validated your therapy across other conditions?”

“Not formally.” Guan Yu glanced at the doctors. Though confident in his healing abilities—witnessing his own wounds seal miraculously—such truths defied explanation.

The dean brightened. “Clinical trials could establish credibility! We’d provide patients and diagnostics. Imagine the impact—”

Guan Yu cut him off: “Prove what? To whom? My qigong needs no validation.”

The room froze under his barrage of questions.

**Chapter 155: Flattery and Fawning**

*What indeed must he prove?* The dean reeled. His assumptions—that Guan Yu sought fame or profit—crumbled. If this youth could cure incurables, patients would beg him directly.

Guan Yu pulled Luo Cheng forward. “This drains me profoundly. I’m here solely for my friend’s mother. Your profit assumptions are mistaken.”

The dean retreated awkwardly, exchanging hollow pleasantries before fleeing. His entourage exchanged sheepish looks and dispersed.

Back in his office, humiliation burned. Accustomed to deference, Guan Yu’s bluntness unsettled him. Before he could regroup, the phone rang.

“Dean Yu? I’ve informed the Chairman about your qigong prodigy—”

Cold sweat drenched the dean. *Too soon! If the Chairman expects results I can’t deliver…*

**Chapter 156: Free Lunch**

When Guan Yu resumed treatment, Dean Yu crept in, uncharacteristically obsequious.

“Qigong session ongoing?” He tiptoed, shushing others.

Guan Yu noted the change but continued channeling energy. Six seconds later—his current limit—he withdrew his hand.

“Done?” Luo Cheng hovered anxiously.

Before Guan Yu could answer, nurses swarmed in, transferring Mother Luo to a gurney.

“What’s happening?!” Luo Cheng demanded.

Guan Yu’s gaze turned icy—were they exploiting his patient for tests?

The dean blanched under his glare. “Merely facilitating deeper examination! Complementary diagnostics!”

But Guan Yu’s distrust lingered. Free lunches rarely came without hidden costs.
