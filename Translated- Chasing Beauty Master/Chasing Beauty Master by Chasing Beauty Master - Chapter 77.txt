After seeing Luo Cheng off, Guan Yu rubbed his hands together and glanced at Niu Le and Du Xiaojuan sitting nearby. Raising an eyebrow excitedly, he proposed, “Should we… go scout the location first?”

Chapter 186: Stone Gambling

Scouting didn’t mean anything illicit! Stone gambling remained rare in Nanjing, far from jadeite mining regions. Most jewelry companies here avoided this high-risk trade—ka~

However… a few large jewelers had imported moderately priced raw jadeite materials, operating semi-formal stone gambling ventures.

Guan Yu’s reason for reconnaissance was simple: he needed to verify whether his detection skill could truly identify翡翠 (jadeite) inside rough stones. Only experimentation would yield answers.

Du Xiaojuan sprang up, clutching Guan Yu’s arm with sparkling eyes, clearly enthralled by the prospect. Niu Le trailed silently behind them like a bodyguard, his canvas satchel slung across the neck drawing occasional glances.

They hailed a taxi to the jewelry mall Luo Cheng had casually mentioned earlier. During dinner, Guan Yu hadn’t disclosed their stone-gambling plans, and Luo Cheng—unfamiliar with the trade—had merely named two companies dabbling in it.

Arriving at Kunlun Jewelry Company, a saleslady greeted them at the entrance: “Welcome, sir. Are you here for jewelry or gemstones?”

Niu Le gaped at the opulent décor while Du Xiaojuan nudged Guan Yu to respond.

“I heard you offer stone gambling. We’d like to look,” Guan Yu said casually.

“Ah, trying your luck with raw stones! One moment—I’ll fetch someone to assist.” The saleslady nodded politely before hurrying off.

Good service—no condescension, Guan Yu noted approvingly.

Soon, a bespectacled man approached. “This way, sir. Our materials are stored in the rear warehouse. If interested, we have specialists to cut stones you purchase.” He led them through a service corridor.

Entering the backyard garage, they were met by buzzing chatter and the screech of cutting blades.

Dozens of grayish stones lined shelves against the walls. After thanking their guide, Guan Yu eagerly pulled his companions forward.

Clusters of hopefuls examined rocks while Guan Yu zeroed in on an oval specimen. These enigmatic stones defied even modern technology—only seasoned gamblers claimed to discern clues from their rough exteriors, though success remained mere chance. Hence “gambling.”

Ignored by others, Guan Yu noted price tags: 2,000-3,000 yuan. Bargain bin materials—in Yunnan or Myanmar, such low-grade rocks would litter the ground. Here, they tantalized amateurs seeking cheap thrills.

Guan Yu ran fingers over the cold, hard surface and activated his detection skill, staring intently.

“What’s there?” Du Xiaojuan asked after eight motionless seconds.

Guan Yu shook his head, sighing. His detection skill showed blankness, demanding a classification type. Baffled, he realized prior object appraisals (like lottery tickets) required minimal energy, but stones?

He switched focus to monetary value: the system labeled it worthless—a 35-yuan rock. Subsequent checks on other stones yielded identical results.

“Is this company peddling fakes?” he muttered, doubting his skill’s reliability until remembering: jadeite presence detection might require higher energy.

Testing this theory, overwhelming heat surged behind his eyes! He jerked back, drenched in cold sweat—this drain surpassed even healing Luo’s mother! One more second might’ve knocked him unconscious.

Chapter 187: Satisfactory Detection

Why such drastic energy consumption? Value appraisal drained normally, but翡翠 detection exhausted him. Reluctantly, he halted further attempts.

Commuton erupted behind them—“Cutting time! Let’s see if it hits!”

Joining the crowd, Guan Yu watched a middle-aged man guide a screeching blade across a secured stone. Water cascaded over the slicing edge.

First cut—bare white interior. Onlookers groaned. “Another angle!” someone urged.

The stone’s owner—a portly, sunglasses-wearing man—hesitated before paying 50 yuan for a second cut. Still no jadeite.

Guan Yu’s detection skill confirmed the rock’s worthlessness. Yet partial cuts left uncertainty—until inspiration struck: scanning already-cut waste sections required negligible energy, revealing crystal-clear 3D models of barren interiors.

As the stubborn owner ordered more cuts, Guan Yu dragged his friends back to the shelves, energized by this breakthrough.

“Brother Yu, just buy random stones!” Niu Le whispered after multiple fruitless rounds.

“Patience,” Guan Yu deflected, reactivating his skill. At a football-sized black stone priced at 13,000 yuan, he stiffened—detection revealed a dark green jadeite vein!

Though clueless about its grade or value, this confirmed his skill worked. Energy conservation prevented deeper analysis, but avoiding losses sufficed for now.

Chapter 188: Lucrative Opportunity

“This one!” Guan Yu declared.

Du Xiaojuan winced at the price. “That’s expensive! How about cheaper ones?”

“Quality costs,” Guan Yu insisted, ignoring Niu Le’s gesture toward a 40,000-yuan boulder. After payment, a saleslady explained: “First cut’s free. Subsequent ones cost 50 yuan each.”

“I’ll cut it myself,” Guan Yu announced, earning the cutter’s wary consent.

Positioning the stone using his skill’s guidance, he aligned the blade to graze the jadeite vein. As the blade whirred, anticipation thickened—the moment of truth approached.
