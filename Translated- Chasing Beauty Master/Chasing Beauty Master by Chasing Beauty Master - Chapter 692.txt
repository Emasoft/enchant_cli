Guan Yu gently alighted upon the icy surface, spreading his spiritual sense outward. He found himself in a circular ice chamber spanning several dozen zhang, its contours so precise they might have been drawn with compasses. Towering ice walls surrounded him, though no more frost giants emerged from their crystalline depths. Those that had pursued him now lay shattered upon the ice floor, while others disintegrated into glittering shards that fused back into the walls moments before impact.

Undoubtedly, this marked the glacial chasm's nadir – with frost giants serving as guardians. On Earth, none save Guan Yu could have descended this far. Even warriors like Ivanov and Ito returning from divine trials would have been torn asunder mid-air by these crystalline sentinels.

Yet what purpose did this frozen abyss serve? Could it truly connect to the Arctic Origin?

As the thought surfaced, Guan Yu summoned the Illusory Heaven Pearl. Tossing it skyward, the artifact projected Earth's phantom image as expected. At the northernmost point of this apparition, a luminous dot pulsed violently near the Arctic position, radiating blinding radiance.

"Congratulations on locating the Arctic Origin's sanctuary," resonated a voice. "Beneath your feet lies the Polar Extremis. To protect this primal force, I established an Extreme Ice Formation here – concealing both the chasm's depth and its aura. Until the appointed hour, no surface exploration could detect this sanctum. Retrieving the Polar Extremis marks your first stride in Earth's salvation. Yet did I not warn that only one with supreme ice affinity could extract it? Where is your companion?"

The voice from Huanyu Corporation echoed again, its owner now reneging on unspoken terms. When had this bodiless entity ever mentioned ice affinity requirements?

Before Guan Yu could voice objections, the ancient voice chuckled, "Young man, I sensed your excellence when last we met. How does a mere Earthling attain Realm Sovereign cultivation? And curb your silent reproach – is occasional forgetfulness not permissible for aged emperors?"

Ten thousand mythical grass-mud horses stampeded through Guan Yu's mind, yet he maintained decorum: "Great Emperor, how dare I question your wisdom? I merely lament forgetting my ice-affinity companion. Your frost guardians prove too formidable for ordinary humans. If Earth lacks Realm Sovereign cultivators, who then could retrieve the Arctic Origin?"

The voice conceded with mirth: "A rare oversight in my thousand considerations. I presumed any activating the Heaven Pearl would intuit its purpose – that projecting its illusion above would teleport users safely here, bypassing guardians. Yet here stands a brute-force blunderer who charged through defenses, moreover forgetting crucial allies!"

Guan Yu's assumptions crumbled – this ancient entity clearly still lived somewhere across the cosmos. Before he could inquire, the voice anticipated: "Cosmic mysteries elude Earth's science and other worlds' magic or cultivation systems. At certain power thresholds, time and space become mere playthings."

"At forty, your Realm Sovereign cultivation surpasses my youthful progress. Continue thus and you'll unravel these mysteries. I merely wandered past this azure jewel, foresaw its cataclysm, and left the Heaven Pearl to guide its saviors."

Chapter 1759: Just the Beginning

Guan Yu pressed: "If you visited Earth's past, how foresee its future? Why not intervene directly?"

The voice mused: "When the Pearl last activated, I projected this wisp of consciousness across dimensions. Should you reach my tier, we may meet again. As for prescience – at certain cultivation levels, past and future blur. Imagine I witnessed Earth's demise from its own tomorrow."

"Moreover, Earth's fragility constrained me to an avatar. My true form's arrival would shatter your world. Thus salvation must come from within. Remember – Earth's fate rests in native hands."

Guan Yu shuddered at implications of temporal traversal. Though Realm Sovereign cultivation once seemed invincible, this exchange revealed his insignificance before true cosmic powers. Could cultivators truly surpass planetary tolerance?

The voice chuckled at his thoughts: "The cosmos dwarfs imagination. With ten millennia and galaxy-leaping strides, I've glimpsed but fragments. Seek answers beyond your cradle through cultivation."

As the presence faded, Guan Yu sensed its departure – likely via high-tier spatial transmission. Despair gripped him momentarily before resolve rekindled: Even cosmic predators couldn't intimidate humanity's defiance.

Chapter 1760: Spiritual Infusion

Emerging from the chasm, Guan Yu found Xue Jing anxiously waiting. The vivacious girl leaped into his arms: "Husband! Did you get the Origin? Show me!"

Guan Yu tweaked her nose: "Silly girl, only your ice affinity can retrieve it. We'll descend together now."

Guided by the Heaven Pearl's glow, their trio descended unimpeded. The temperature plunged to -100°C, freezing Jones' extremities while Xue Jing danced gleefully in crystalline splendor.

As Xue Jing twirled at the chamber's heart, azure energy vortexes descended – glacial qi funneling into her through the Baihui point. Jones panicked at her entrapment in an ice cocoon, but Guan Yu recognized the Extreme Ice Formation's tempering process.

Xue Jing's cultivation skyrocketed to Saint Sovereign tier within minutes, her body swelling with primordial energies. Guan Yu watched anxiously, recalling catastrophic infusion failures. Yet the ancient emperor's design held true – when the maelstrom ceased, his beloved emerged radiant, having absorbed Earth's Arctic essence without harm.
