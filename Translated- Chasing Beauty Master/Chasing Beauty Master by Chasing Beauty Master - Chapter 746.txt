The venue for tomorrow’s competition is the stadium just a street away from here. Guanyu brought the three beauties to a Western restaurant. Since it was close to the hotel and everyone was too lazy to walk far, they decided to dine there after noticing its appealing exterior across the street.

The Western restaurant was decorated in a classic European and American style. Soft piano music greeted them upon entry, creating a soothing ambiance. The four found a table and settled in.

“Order whatever you like for yourselves,” Guanyu announced. Zhang Han, never one to hold back, immediately ordered two pizzas, a steak, and a plate of shrimp pasta.

**Chapter 1892: Passionate Flames**

Zhang Han had piled her plate high with food. Though the tourist area’s prices were steep, money meant nothing to her. Raised by the Yang family, she had never lacked for anything, living a life of pampered luxury.

Despite her petite frame, Zhang Han was a voracious eater. She could snack nonstop for twenty-four hours without feeling full, though her true passion lay in junk food rather than proper meals.

Amei ordered the least—just a milk tea. Guanyu asked, “Amei, why eat so little? You need to fill your stomach properly.”

Amei smiled sweetly. “I’m not hungry. A milk tea is enough. Ordering more would just lead to waste.”

Guanyu said nothing more. Zhang Han’s eating habits starkly contrasted her delicate appearance. Though she looked adorable, she devoured her food like a starved wolf. “Slow down, Zhang Han,” Guanyu cautioned. “No one’s stealing your food. Don’t choke.”

Zhang Han ignored him, head bowed as she demolished her meal.

“Well, well, hello there, beauty! Mind if we get acquainted?”

Flies swarmed wherever they went. Just as the group was enjoying their meal, a grating voice interrupted. Lanyu, the first to react, glared at the intruder and snapped, “Who let this mutt off its leash? Disgusting.”

Guanyu glanced up. The man appeared to be in his early twenties, with a square face, slit-like eyes barely visible beneath thick, unkempt brows, and a slicked-back hairstyle reminiscent of old Shanghai gangsters. His hair gleamed under the lights, greased to perfection.

Amei sipped her tea quietly, while Zhang Han remained absorbed in her food. Guanyu’s steak was only half-finished, but Zhang Han had already polished off two pizzas.

The man, Wei Shengjin, had targeted Lanyu, likely drawn by her striking figure. Amei sat with her back to the room, and Zhang Han’s face was hidden as she ate. Lanyu, however, wore a fiery red leather outfit—a cropped top revealing her toned midriff and a micro-skirt that barely covered essentials.

Wei Shengjin, a local troublemaker affiliated with the “Natural Gang,” had entered the upscale restaurant for a free meal courtesy of his lackeys. But the moment he spotted Lanyu, his lust overpowered him. He eyed Guanyu briefly but, seeing only unfamiliar faces and three women, grew bold.

Lanyu’s sharp retort only excited Wei Shengjin further. Licking his lips, he crooned, “Feisty! I like that.”

Amei turned to glance at him. Dressed conservatively in a plain white tracksuit, her beauty still stunned Wei Shengjin, whose jaw dropped. “Heavens! What luck—two stunners in one day!” he exclaimed, leering.

Amei frowned in discomfort, glancing at Guanyu, who was finishing his steak.

Impatient, Wei Shengjin barked at his lackeys, “Book me a luxury suite tonight! I’m flying double!”

As the Natural Gang leader’s brother-in-law, Wei Shengjin ruled the area. Most small businesses kowtowed to him. Smirking at Lanyu, he flashed yellowed teeth. “Come with me tonight, beauty. I’ll make it unforgettable!”

His lackeys guffawed. When Wei Shengjin reached for Amei’s shoulder, Guanyu seized his wrist. “My women find you repulsive. Get lost.”

“You dare!” Wei Shengjin snarled. “I’ll teach you to act tough!” He kicked at Guanyu’s chest, but Guanyu countered swiftly, sending Wei crashing into a nearby table. Patrons screamed as dishes shattered.

“Serves you right,” Zhang Han muttered between bites.

Groaning, Wei Shengjin struggled up. “You’ll pay for this! I’ll die before I let those girls go!”

Lanyu rolled her eyes. “Just finish him, Guanyu.”

“Leave now,” Guanyu said coldly, “or I’ll ensure you never leave whole.”

**Chapter 1893: Swatting Flies**

Guanyu had hoped for a peaceful meal before sightseeing, but trouble always found beauties like his companions. Their allure—Lanyu’s boldness, Amei’s innocence, Zhang Han’s charm—drew unwanted attention like moths to flame.

When Wei Shengjin cursed, Guanyu silenced him with a kick that cracked ribs. The restaurant manager, a plain-faced woman in her thirties, rushed over. “What’s happening?”

“Just swatting flies,” Guanyu replied.

The crowd murmured. Everyone knew Wei Shengjin’s connections. Patrons pitied Guanyu even as they relished the bully’s comeuppance.

“Done eating?” Guanyu asked Zhang Han. She nodded, licking grease from her fingers. As they left, Wei Shengjin wheezed threats: “You’ll pay! Those girls are mine!”

Ignoring him, Guanyu pondered buying masks for the trio. Their beauty was a magnet for trouble.

Next, they visited Sanhai Amusement Park. Lanyu and Zhang Han clamored for the haunted house—an underground labyrinth with live footage broadcast outside. Amei, terrified, opted for the carousel while the others rode thrillers.

By evening, they returned to the hotel. At dinner, Zhang Han chose a Sichuan hotpot place. But as they settled in, Wei Shengjin’s lackeys appeared with reinforcements—Han Qiao, a hulking Westerner fluent in Mandarin.

**Chapter 1894: Peaceful Dinner**

Guanyu recognized Han Qiao, an old acquaintance from rival gangs. “Promoted to Natural Gang leader?” he mocked.

Han Qiao stiffened. He knew Guanyu’s prowess. “You injured our leader’s brother-in-law. Compensation is due.”

“He harassed my women,” Guanyu stated. “Consider his survival mercy.”

When a lackey urged reclaiming the girls, Han Qiao berated him. “Fool! You’d court death?”

To Guanyu, he pressed, “At least cover medical costs.”

“No,” Guanyu said. “Warn your leader: next time, I send him to the morgue.”

As Guanyu returned to his seat, Han Qiao’s lackey gaped. “Boss, we can’t just—”

“Shut up!” Han Qiao barked. He knew challenging Guanyu meant suicide.

The girls ate in peace, Wei Shengjin’s threats fading like smoke. Yet Amei’s guilt lingered—she blamed herself for ruining the others’ fun. Guanyu reassured her, but the day’s shadows stretched long.

Tomorrow’s competition awaited, but tonight, spicy broth and laughter drowned out the chaos. For now, the flies were swatted, and the moon rose quietly over the city’s restless heart.
