“It’s time to counterattack.” Guan Yu chuckled lightly.

Chapter 652: Counterattack

Perseverance yields its rewards.

After half a month of chaotic strife, the end finally approached. By all logic, Cheng Gui should have been triumphant. With the full support of Taiwan’s “Black Path Patriarch” in manpower, funds, and resources, there was no reason he couldn’t crush Xiao Xiong.

When Guan Yu had yet to appear, Cheng Gui held absolute advantage. But once Guan Yu emerged, that advantage steadily eroded. After successfully destroying a shipment of arms Cheng Gui had imported from Taiwan, the tides clearly shifted in their favor.

During Guan Yu’s days of unconsciousness, Cheng Gui faced relentless harassment. The police repeatedly summoned him for questioning regarding Chen Laida’s arms trafficking and hostage crisis. Meanwhile, quality control authorities piled pressure on Hanhai’s departments.

Cheng Gui’s political protector—the deputy mayor—now found himself embroiled in scandal over misconduct. Bereft of shelter, Cheng Gui’s underground battles with Xiao Xiong reached stalemate.

Yet from yesterday onward, the balance shattered completely. With sudden support from Zhang Yi and the Mo family, the scales tipped decisively toward Xiao Xiong.

Hanhai’s lucrative projects faced bureaucratic suspensions under Mo family pressure. Cheng Gui scrambled between departments by day, lobbying power brokers by night.

But the tides had turned.

“Some are born servants, others masters. Envy breeds nothing.”

“Last time we left roots, chaos sprouted. I won’t repeat that mistake.” Xiao Xiong declared his stance.

Guan Yu agreed. Yet another concern arose: “Xiao-ge, check if Wan Qianshan remains in L City. If found, notify me immediately. That bastard dared reach for N City—I’ll make sure he never returns.”

“When will you return to N City?” Xiao Xiong asked.

“The day after tomorrow,” Guan Yu said. “Wan Qianshan planted moles among the elders. I must return soon. But first, I’ll track Cheng Gui—if he meets Wan Qianshan, I’ll eliminate both. Otherwise, Cheng Gui dies first.”

“Alone?”

Grinning, Guan Yu replied, “Solo missions prove most... flexible.”

“Be careful.” Xiao Xiong said no more—his confidence in Guan Yu had grown exponentially.

The blow came without warning.

Cheng Gui staggered up from the floor, reseating himself opposite Wan Qianshan. Calmly, he stated, “Without me, your dragon struggles against Xiao Xiong’s serpent.”

Wan Qianshan sneered. “You’re replaceable. Finding ambitious puppets proves easy.”

Cheng Gui scoffed. “Only I rival Xiao Xiong here. Others? Crumbling faster than you blink.”

Wan Qianshan leaned forward, danger radiating. “Your men’s loyalty? Or Hanhai’s invincibility?”

Cheng Gui paled.

“No absolute loyalty—only insufficient betrayal price.” Wan Qianshan smiled. “Choose: fight Xiao Xiong with my resources, or die.”

Huang Ming drew his pistol.

“I agree.” Cheng Gui capitulated, trembling.

After Cheng Gui’s departure, Wan Qianshan turned to Huang Ming. “Have Zhou Jin act. Let’s see which side he protects.”

The worst fears materialized.

Guan宇’s phone rang mid-strategy session with Xiao Xiong.

Answering, his face darkened to murderous frost.

“N City’s in chaos,” Guan Yu rasped. “The elders are compromised.”

Without explanation, he stormed out.

Xiao Xiong handed him the Hummer keys. “Go. I’ll handle Cheng Gui.”

The engine roared as Guan Yu raced toward crisis.
