“Liu Shilei was trying to psyche herself up! Though she kept refusing verbally, seeing Guan Yu's pitiful appearance always made her heart soften involuntarily. Deep down, there seemed to be a faint inclination in her heart to agree to his request.

“Just one hug. I really miss you. Sister Shilei, don't... don't you miss me?” Guan Yu tilted his head and whispered, gazing affectionately at Liu Shilei with lowered, tender tones.

This kind of melancholic, world-weary demeanor from a man—especially paired with deeply affectionate eyes—was undoubtedly the most lethal weapon against a woman's defenses. Liu Shilei anxiously ruffled her hair, glanced at the stairwell entrance, and pricked up her ears to confirm no footsteps were approaching. Then she sidestepped, grabbed Guan Yu's arm, and dragged him into a corner.

“Just for a moment! You scoundrel, you've got me wrapped around your finger! If anyone sees us, how can I keep teaching here? I'd die of embarrassment!” Liu Shilei murmured softly, yet slowly opened her arms to embrace Guan Yu's back. Like a delicate bird nestling against him, she tilted her head onto his shoulder.

Leaning against the wall, Guan Yu held Liu Shilei's soft form, inhaling the uniquely pleasant feminine fragrance of her body. He closed his eyes in bliss.

“This feels so right... I wish I could hold you like this forever and never let go...” Guan Yu whispered tenderly, turning his head to plant a gentle kiss on Liu Shilei's forehead.

The corners of Liu Shilei's lips curled into a faint smile as she tightened her arms around Guan Yu.

Women truly were auditory creatures. Sweet nothings and honeyed words would always be the poison that made them lose themselves. Generally, men who couldn't spout sweet talk could never become philandering playboys! To chase girls, one had to be willing to use their silver tongue. To Guan Yu, this was no big deal. Though the lovey-dovey talk might sound cringeworthy, as long as beauties enjoyed hearing it, that was enough!

Though initially embarrassing for men to utter such words, after repeating them a few times and successfully coaxing beauties into joyful submission, one would realize women were actually quite simple. A man just needed to sweet-talk, show tenderness and humor, occasionally display masculine dominance and strength to make women feel secure. Then even the most stunning beauties would open their hearts.

Chapter 293: Sworn Sisters and Sworn Brothers

Clearly, Guan Yu had grasped the essence of wooing women—though he knew his skin wasn't thick enough compared to those wolves specialized in seducing married women and decent housewives. Back in high school, he'd known a gangster who did nothing but chase after young married women all day, happily juggling multiple affairs. Those women all acted like infatuated maidens, following him devotedly.

During a later drinking session, this buddy's words truly enlightened Guan Yu on pursuing women: “Married women endure bland daily routines. They crave being pampered, cherished, and sweet-talked. Once a man appears who treats her like a treasure, making her feel loved and happy, how could she resist sleeping with you?”

Of course, Guan Yu despised his friend's behavior. But from these exploits, one truth emerged clearly: women were auditory creatures. If you knew what they liked hearing and could provide those feelings as a man... you'd gradually claim their hearts.

No material goods or money needed—just move your lips and women would draw near. Expert seducers always possessed silver tongues that could make women feel like they were bathing in honey...

Just as Guan Yu was smugly savoring his insights, Liu Shilei suddenly stiffened and pushed him away.

What happened? Moments ago they were affectionate—why the sudden cold shoulder? Guan Yu wondered in confusion.

Following Liu Shilei's stunned gaze, Guan Yu froze too. When had she arrived?

At the stairwell landing stood the Academic Affairs Director, gaping dumbly at them. After vigorously rubbing her eyes, she confirmed she wasn't hallucinating.

“Uh... hello, Director.” Guan Yu awkwardly scratched his nose and forced a smile at the stunned administrator.

Liu Shilei burned with shame, wishing she could pinch Guan Yu hard. See? We got caught! I said no hugging! Now how do we explain this? She gritted her teeth furiously.

“Ah... Guan Yu. Teacher Liu, you're here too. Perfect—the principal wants to see you.” The Director quickly regained composure, ascending the stairs casually.

“Director... when did you arrive? Did you see...”

“Just now. Saw nothing!” The Director immediately shook her head with feigned seriousness.

Damn... you knew exactly what I meant! Guan Yu rolled his eyes helplessly. The Director, realizing her hasty response, scratched her ear awkwardly.

She'd seen everything—but what could she do? This troublemaker was even harder to handle than Jin Cheng. Even the principal had to pamper and appease him now! That spectacular scene at the school gate remained vivid—offending this jinx might cost her life!

See nothing when you've seen everything! Teacher-student relationships weren't that scandalous anyway. If she were younger, she might have eyed those campus beauties too...

But... this kid had real skills! To woo Teacher Liu, the most coveted beauty in the college—truly remarkable!

Wait... The Director suddenly stiffened. “Guan Yu, you're Teacher Liu's younger brother, right?”

Younger brother?! The Director broke into cold sweat. Cousins? If they were... Gulping nervously, she nearly choked.

Would she be silenced? Should she... negotiate with Guan Yu? Beads of sweat dotted her forehead.

“Director, did you need me for something?” Liu Shilei calmly tucked her hair back, composed.

“Ah yes! The principal wants you in his office for discussion.”

Guan Yu shrugged at them, then turned and scampered away.

Left alone, Liu Shilei and the Director exchanged uneasy glances.

“Let's go... What does the principal want?” Liu Shilei smoothed her professional attire, descending the stairs calmly.

“Not sure... probably about Guan Yu,” the Director said offhandedly.

“What?” Liu Shilei paled. Did the principal know?

Seeing her alarm, the Director hastily added: “The principal knows Guan Yu's your brother. The new transfer student this morning is his sworn sister—she's got impressive connections! By the way, isn't Guan Yu your brother?”

Liu Shilei bit her lip. “Sworn brother...”

The Director nearly tripped, swallowing hard. Holy... Guan Yu's incredible! Sworn sisters and brothers—all these beauties falling for him? That kid's lucky in love! Hogging all the good fortune—doesn't he know about sharing?!

Reading the Director's thoughts, Liu Shilei blushed and hurried toward the principal's office.

Was the principal summoning her over Guan Yu's recent troubles? Her stomach churned—after all, she'd gotten Guan Yu into this university. Was this a reprimand?

Chapter 294: Student Union President

Upon entering the principal's office, the elderly administrator warmly rose: “Teacher Liu! Please sit.”

As Liu Shilei sat, the principal fetched her water, perplexing her.

“Principal, why did you call me here?”

The principal smiled genially. “How's your recent workload? Managing the freshmen okay?”

“Fine... no issues. Why do you ask?”

“Just checking. Students nowadays are so unruly. As principal, I understand teachers' hardships. You've witnessed our school's situation these past years.”

Liu Shilei nodded blankly, baffled by his circumlocution.

The principal sighed. “We've wanted to discipline troublemakers but faced obstacles. By the way, Guan Yu's your brother, yes? You mentioned during his interview.”

“Yes...” Liu Shilei tensed. Was this about punishing Guan Yu?

“How's he adjusting here?”

“Well enough. Boys will be boys—a bit mischievous.”

The principal nodded. “Young men inevitably clash at this fiery age. But I know Guan Yu's an excellent student—upstanding character!”

Liu Shilei blinked in surprise. Was he... praising Guan Yu?

“Those junior delinquents have polluted our campus atmosphere! I've longed to cleanse this but lacked means. Yet Guan Yu shares my intolerance for injustice—he boldly stood against Jin Cheng's gang! Know how I felt hearing this?”

“Relieved! Thrilled! We must fully support such students! Guan Yu represents hope for reforming our campus ethos. Don't you agree?”

Liu Shilei's mind reeled. Was the principal applauding Guan Yu's brawl?

School support? How?

“I... don't understand, Principal.”

“Simple. The senior Student Union President graduates soon. During freshman elections, I think Guan Yu's perfect for the position!”

“What?!” Liu Shilei's jaw dropped. Guan Yu? Student Union President?

The principal frowned. “Objections? I find him ideal for disciplinary reform!”

Liu Shilei numbly nodded. Too ideal—whoever disobeys gets beaten up! What was the principal thinking?

Seeing her shock, the principal leaned forward earnestly: “The Student Union needs expansion too. Let Guan Yu handpick members—we won't interfere. Sound good?”

Liu Shilei inhaled deeply. Was the principal drunk? Letting Guan Yu recruit would fill the union with thugs!

Wait... disciplinary reform? Was the principal outsourcing troublemaker control to Guan Yu? Using the Student Union as cover? Clever—but dangerous!

“Principal... shouldn't we consult Guan Yu first?”

The principal brightened. “Of course! We'll meet any reasonable demands! I'll personally guarantee it!”

Chapter 295: This Is Good News

Liu Shilei opposed embroiling Guan Yu in this mess, but the principal dropped a bombshell.

“That film crew in N City needs interns. Though a freshman, Guan Yu's perfect! The pop star Gao Wei's joining too—youth love celebrities!”

Liu Shilei was speechless. The principal was bribing Guan Yu with celebrity access to accept the presidency!

She wanted to refuse, but how? This internship was a golden opportunity students fought over.

“Principal, this needs Guan Yu's consent.”

“Naturally! Whatever conditions he has—within reason—I'll approve!” The principal thumped his desk decisively.
