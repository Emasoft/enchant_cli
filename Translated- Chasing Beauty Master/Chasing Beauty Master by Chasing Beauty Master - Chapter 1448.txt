The next morning, Wang Xiaorong awoke early. Seeing Guan Yu still sleeping soundly, she chose not to disturb him and decided to go out to buy breakfast so he could have a warm meal upon waking.

As she left the room, she hesitated, worried Guan Yu might panic if he woke to find her gone. She resolved to leave a note inside. But just as she turned back, a searing pain exploded at the back of her skull, and darkness swallowed her consciousness. Yan Zhao, who had been lying in wait outside the inn all night, now gripped the unconscious Young Master of the Demon Soul Sect by the arm.

A smug chuckle escaped Yan Zhao’s lips. Capturing the sect’s heir would earn him immense merit—if word spread. His mind raced with possibilities: trading her for the antidote to the Blood Toxin to free himself from the sect’s control, or perhaps delivering her to Manor Lord Lu to bolster Lu Manor’s defenses against the Demon Soul Sect. Yet touching her now was too risky. If the sect discovered his betrayal, his life would be forfeit. Better to hand her over to Lu Manor and let them bear the consequences. After all, Guan Yu’s group had brought her here. Any retaliation would fall on them, not him.

Guan Yu stirred awake, immediately noticing Wang Xiaorong’s absence. This was Tiger’s Maw Manor—she wouldn’t wander recklessly. Where had she gone? Heart pounding, he rushed back to Lu Manor.

“Xiao Zhi! Wake up! Wang Xiaorong’s missing!” Guan Yu shouted, shaking his companion.

“Are you mad?” Xiao Zhi hissed, jabbing a finger at him. “Screaming here? This is Lu Manor, not some backwater village! How should I know where she went? Maybe she left for a stroll. Why panic?”

“She wouldn’t go alone—she’s not foolish! This place reeks of danger. Someone must’ve taken her!” Guan Yu’s voice tightened. “If Lu Manor captured her, we’re in trouble.”

Yan Zhao sauntered in, feigning ignorance. “What’s all this shouting about?”

“Nothing,” Guan Yu deflected. “We bicker like this often. Two days without squabbling feels wrong.”

Yan Zhao didn’t press, settling into a chair. “Guan Yu, your injuries seem healed. But doesn’t this strike you as odd? The protective wards over Tiger’s Maw Manor have vanished, yet the Demon Soul Sect hasn’t attacked. They should’ve seized this chance.”

Guan Yu’s stomach dropped. The sect’s inaction meant Wang Xiaorong hadn’t returned—they feared endangering their Young Master. “Perhaps their Left Envoy remains hidden here,” he suggested, “waiting to coordinate an assault from within.”

Xiao Zhi nodded. “A solid theory. Let’s scout outside—we might uncover their plans.”

As they dispersed, Yan Zhao declared, “I’ll inform Manor Lord Lu.”

Pacing the streets, Guan Yu’s anxiety mounted. Wang Xiaorong’s identity made her an easy target. “Xiao Zhi,” he muttered, “could Lu Manor have taken her from our room?”

“You were sleeping beside her!” Xiao Zhi retorted. “Wouldn’t you have heard intruders?”

The logic held, yet her disappearance baffled them. Their search proved futile—Lu Manor’s patrols swarmed everywhere. “If she’s here, they’ve already caught her,” Guan Yu fretted.

Meanwhile, the Left Envoy—disguised as a commoner—collected medicinal herbs at an apothecary. Xiao Zhi spotted him first. “Guan Yu! That’s the Left Envoy!”

Though dressed plainly, the man’s aura and wrist-bound artifact betrayed him. They gave chase, but Lu Manor soldiers intercepted their quarry. The Left Envoy felled a dozen guards effortlessly before Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi engaged him.

To their shock, the usually formidable Left Envoy faltered, succumbing to Guan Yu’s palm strike. Blood spewed from his lips as he collapsed.

“He’s severely injured,” Xiao Zhi observed, examining dropped herbs. “These are bone-mending remedies.”

“Where’s Wang Xiaorong?” Guan Yu demanded.

“You took her!” the Left Envoy spat. “I returned wounded to rescue our Young Master. Where have you hidden her?”

Guan Yu paled—if she wasn’t with the envoy, catastrophe loomed.

Yan Zhao arrived, feigning surprise. “Marvelous capture! Let’s deliver him to Manor Lord Lu.” As he bound the envoy, he whispered, “Strike me later and flee.”

But the Left Envoy coldly countered, “Take me to Lu.”

In Lu Manor’s hall, the bound Left Envoy maintained his haughty demeanor as Manor Lord Lu circled him. “How the mighty have fallen. Did you ever imagine groveling before those you called ants?”

“Spare your gloating. I accept defeat.”

Yan Zhao presented the herbs. “We caught him purchasing these—likely treating grave injuries.”

Guan Yu shot Yan Zhao a withering glare at the stolen credit but held his tongue.

Manor Lord Lu smiled. “My gratitude, young heroes. With their Left Envoy captured, the Demon Soul Sect’s hands are tied.”

Producing Wang Xiaorong’s Butterfly Pouch artifact, he gloated, “This will please your Demon Lord.”

Guan Yu lunged, but Xiao Zhi restrained him.

The Left Envoy’s eyes narrowed at Guan Yu. So this whelp betrayed the Young Master? Yet hearing their subsequent panicked whispers about rescuing her, realization dawned.

When Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi later conspired to save Wang Xiaorong, the Left Envoy emerged from shadows. “You speak truth?”

“Circumstances force unlikely alliances,” Guan Yu stated.

The Left Envoy’s lip curled. “You caused this—you’ll fix it. I’ll create a diversion tonight. Save her yourselves.”

“We’ll do it,” Guan Yu vowed. “At midnight, draw their forces. We’ll get her out.”
