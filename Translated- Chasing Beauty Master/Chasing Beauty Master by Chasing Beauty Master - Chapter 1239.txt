For cultivators, a master practitioner is always held in high esteem. Since Guan Yu wasn't from the Cloud Azure Sect, it would be better to befriend him. Who knows how useful he might prove in the future?

After the staff-wielding man finished speaking, the short, stocky black-clad figure stepped forward and whispered something in his ear. Though Guan Yu couldn't catch the murmured exchange, he noticed the staff-bearer's gaze sharpen dangerously.

Guan Yu observed the portly figure curiously. Whatever words had been exchanged, they'd clearly shifted the situation's dynamics.

"Three against one young disciple?" Guan Yu called out mockingly. "How utterly shameless of you!"

Wen Ming stared at this unexpected ally in bewilderment. Behind his back, Guan Yu made subtle hand gestures signaling Siqi to release the spiritual pressure binding the young disciple. With a murmured incantation and wave of her jade scepter, Siqi dissolved the restraints. Wen Ming collapsed to one knee as if his bones had turned to jelly, his body trembling from the sudden release of compression.

"Ah, you've endured quite the ordeal, brother," Guan Yu remarked, moving to assist. "Let's get you—"

The staff-wielding cultivator raised his implement, cutting him short. Guan Yu felt the telltale prickle of gathered spiritual energy—an impending spell. Without hesitation, he lunged forward to disrupt the casting.

His speed shocked even Siqi. Though devoid of internal energy, Guan Yu moved with preternatural swiftness. The Second-Class Guardian intercepted, but Guan Yu had faced worse—two minutes against Xue Jing's Frost Goddess persona had steeled him for this dance.

Their clash of limbs became a blur. Mid-parry, Guan Yu flicked a hidden dagger from his sleeve. The blade sang through the air at an impossible angle, forcing the staff-bearer to block. Steel screeched against wood as the deflected dagger embedded itself deep in a tree trunk.

Though interrupted, the enemy mage began gathering energy anew. Guan Yu, locked in combat with the guardian, produced another blade—this wouldn't be settled quickly.

"Useless fool!" the staff-bearer barked at his stocky companion. "Stop gawking and assist!"

The portly man shifted uneasily. "Perhaps... we should withdraw before this escalates."

"Coward!" came the snarled reply. "Fine! We're done here!" The trio vanished into the shadows, leaving Guan Yu panting but victorious.

Approaching Wen Ming, Guan Yu chuckled, "You should've fled when you could. What madness drove you to stand alone?"

As Siqi emerged from the brush, Wen Ming's eyes widened, his savior instantly forgotten. "Junior Sister Siqi! You two...?"

"Merely passing through on sect business," she replied coolly. "Why were you in this restricted area after dark?"

"I... fancied a midnight stroll," Wen Ming stammered, then gestured to the scorch marks. "Thought I'd hunt game. Found these intruders instead."

Guan Yu snorted. "Stubborn to the death, aren't you? Lucky we came along."

Before further discussion, torchlight approached through the trees. A-Cai led a rescue party, his loyalty overriding fear. Wen Ming groaned—discovery meant punishment.

Siqi's presence electrified the arriving disciples. Cloud Azure's foremost beauty rarely appeared outside her peak. "Report this to the elders," Wen Ming instructed, though none listened—all eyes were on Siqi.

As the group dispersed, Guan Yu noted A-Cai's mixture of relief and awe. True loyalty indeed.

The journey to Convergence Peak tested Guan Yu's resolve. Feigning fear of heights, he "accidentally" embraced Siqi's slender waist during flight, her floral scent intoxicating. They arrived to find Peak Master Dai anxiously mobilizing search parties.

"Three hours became three days!" the matriarch chided without heat. Though centuries old, her beauty retained its edge—a rose with thorns. "Lü Peak Master requested this meeting. Your friends grow restless."

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. Dai's uncharacteristic warmth reeked of hidden motives. When she suggested accompanying him to meet the companions, he cut through pretense: "If it's the Celestial Furnace you want, forget it."

Dai's laugh tinkled like windchimes. "Such suspicion! I merely thought your friends might enjoy our hospitality. My disciples could... entertain that wolf companion of yours."

The unspoken gambit hung clear—use feminine charms to sway Second Only to Wolf. Guan Yu's smile turned icy. "They prefer simple company. But do try your tricks. Watching wolves outplay foxes amuses me."
