“Are you out of your mind? With the paltry silver you have? What good is that? They were offering gold—actual gold! Yet you refused it while others risk their lives for a single coin!” Wang Jun snapped irritably. “Besides, you’re merely a candidate. The actual selection of a son-in-law is still leagues away. To reject gold over a mere placeholder title? You must be insane.”

A’ze now felt a twinge of regret after Wang Jun’s words. He knew the Zhao family’s interest lay not in him personally but in the rarity of his magic. The title of “candidate” was likely empty—a mere formality with no real promise. Had he realized earlier, he should have kept the gold.

Guan Yu glanced up at the stage, where Zhao Xue happened to meet his gaze. Having observed him for some time, she suddenly flushed and nodded courteously before averting her eyes.

Not one to reciprocate coldness, Guan Yu returned the nod. The steward approached, “Young Mistress, let us proceed. Please take your seat at the rear.”

Zhao Xue nodded again, her gaze lingering on Guan Yu and the strikingly beautiful Siqi beside him. Even Zhao Xue, with her pride, acknowledged Siqi’s loveliness.

Seeing such a companion at Guan Yu’s side, Zhao Xue felt a pang of resignation. Perhaps fate had denied her this chance. Though Guan Yu clearly possessed remarkable skill, he showed no intention of stepping onto the stage.

After whispering instructions to the steward and gesturing toward Guan Yu’s group, Zhao Xue resumed the martial tournament. The Zhao family’s promise of gold for victory drew many challengers. Wang Jun nearly joined, but Guan Yu held him back.

“If we leave now, wouldn’t we abandon A’ze here?” Siqi remarked, hinting at her own desire to depart.

A’ze turned. “I’d follow you. Staying alone holds no appeal.”

“But you’re a candidate,” Siqi pressed. “Leaving now seems improper.”

Wang Jun waved dismissively. “Nonsense! They don’t truly want him. Waiting here won’t change that.”

As he spoke, the Zhao steward approached. “Are you all together?”

Guan Yu affirmed, “We are. May we inquire why?”

The steward smiled. “Young Mistress invites you to dine at our estate. Preparations are complete. We hope you’ll honor us.”

Guan Yu glanced at Zhao Xue, now engrossed in a match. “Might I ask the reason? An invitation without cause is... unusual.”

Most would leap at such an offer from the prestigious Zhao family. Yet Guan Yu’s skepticism made the steward falter. Wang Jun interjected, “Does your mistress invite all of us, or just A’ze?”

“All four,” the steward clarified. “Young Mistress admires this young master’s magic and wishes to learn from him.”

Guan Yu turned to A’ze. “Your decision?”

A’ze shrugged. “I’ll follow your lead.”

Noting Siqi’s fatigue, Guan Yu hesitated, but she demurred, “I’ll accompany you if needed.”

Relenting, Guan Yu agreed. The steward led them past the dwindling tournament—where lackluster contenders bored Zhao Xue—to the sprawling Zhao estate.

**Chapter 4404: Pomp and Pretense**

The steward ushered them into a lavish side hall. Wang Jun gaped at the opulent décor. “Even that mural must cost a fortune!”

“Must you gawk like a peasant?” Guan Yu muttered, embarrassed.

Siqi sat quietly, savoring the garden breeze carrying floral scents. Zhao Xue entered, trailed by maids bearing tea.

“Thank you for your hospitality,” Guan Yu greeted courteously.

Zhao Xue reclined imperiously. “You’re Guan Yu, yes? Overheard your name earlier.”

“Honored you recall it,” Guan Yu replied, suspecting Wang Jun’s loudmouth tendencies.

“My father is occupied, so I’ll host you,” Zhao Xue said breezily. “Join me for supper.”

As Wang Jun praised the estate’s grandeur, Zhao Xue turned to Siqi. “This lady beside you—what is she to you?”

Guan Yu sipped tea. “Siqi is my sworn senior... and my beloved.”

The answer warmed Siqi’s heart while subtly rebuffing Zhao Xue, who still wore her veil—a breach of etiquette Guan Yu noted.

“A match heaven-sent,” Zhao Xue remarked, though her eyes narrowed. “But your sect—the Yunqing Sect, yes? A renowned righteous order. How came you here?”

“You know of us?” Guan Yu countered.

“Who hasn’t heard?” she deflected. “Your comrade’s magic today intrigued me. Might he teach me?”

Before A’ze could respond, Guan Yu interjected, “Alas, it’s too late.”

“Why? Must one start young?”

“Your cultivated inner energy blocks spiritual power,” Guan Yu explained. “Only prodigies wield both. Focus on refining your martial arts instead.”

Disappointed, Zhao Xue removed her veil, revealing sharp features and a proud bearing. “What if I purge my energy to learn magic?”

“Agony with high risk of crippling failure,” Guan Yu warned.

Zhao Xue sighed. “Yet my current teachers lack vision.”

“True masters are rare,” Guan Yu conceded. “But your dedication is evident.”

Zhao Xue’s restlessness mirrored the tournament’s decline. Mediocre contenders bored her father, who despaired at his daughter’s unorthodox marriage scheme.

Earlier, she’d halted the event, opting to host these intriguing outsiders. Now, studying Guan Yu’s group, she masked calculation behind hospitality.

“Persist in martial arts,” Guan Yu advised. “Adepts can rival cultivators.”

“Easy words,” Zhao Xue retorted. “Yet you’ve seen my limits. Magic’s allure...”

A’ze finally spoke. “Your skill already impresses. My minor tricks pale in comparison.”

“Flattery won’t sway me,” she laughed. “But stay tonight. Let’s exchange... perspectives.”

As dusk fell, Guan Yu sensed deeper schemes beneath her charm. Yet for A’ze’s sake, he nodded. The Zhao family’s game had only begun.
