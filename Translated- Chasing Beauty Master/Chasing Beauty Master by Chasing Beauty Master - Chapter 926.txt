After a full two hours, the medicinal brew was finally ready, emitting a strong herbal aroma. The pungent scent made Ji Qian slightly dizzy. Nevertheless, she swiftly poured the concoction into a cracked clay jar and carried it to Jiang Shan.

However, Jiang Shan’s weakened state left him unable to assist in drinking the medicine. Ji Qian resorted to holding the liquid in her mouth before gently feeding it to him sip by sip.

Deeply moved by her devotion, Jiang Shan felt tears silently tracing down his cheeks. In that moment, he became a man utterly captivated by affection.

**Chapter 2368: The Big Fatty**

Jones had independently developed numerous signature dishes, which she taught to her chefs. Even these seasoned cooks frequently marveled at her culinary genius.

Perfecting a dish was no simple feat—ingredient ratios, heat control, and precise timing all influenced the final flavor. Yet Jones possessed an innate talent, mastering recipes after merely observing them twice without formal instruction.

Soon, the kitchen staff finished preparations, signaling the time to serve.

“Come,” Jones urged, “taste my chefs’ craftsmanship. This dish was specially selected for you—I’m certain you’ll adore it.”

Without ceremony, Guanyu and Jinhua approached. “I’m rather peckish,” Guanyu remarked cheerfully. “Let’s see how these dishes fare.”

Eight distinct vegetarian courses arrived in succession. Guanyu ate with relish, lavishing praise between bites.

“Naturally,” Jones replied with pride. “My chefs’ skills are unmatched. Without boasting, even the women in your household couldn’t rival them.”

Guanyu nodded in agreement. The best cook among his household was Ah Mei, yet her dishes paled against these master chefs’ creations. Beyond skill, his home kitchen lacked the professional-grade equipment and comprehensive seasonings available here.

Moreover, Guanyu had no interest in transforming his residence into a restaurant kitchen. Adopting Jones’ approach or hiring renowned chefs would inevitably turn his household’s women into “big fatties”—a prospect he dreaded.

Jones, however, defied logic—whether through genetics or secret methods, she remained slender despite her appetite, a trait envied by women everywhere.

Guanyu chuckled, voicing his thoughts: “My household’s women eat voraciously. Hiring chefs like yours would balloon them into big fatties swiftly. Best to keep their portions modest—I’ve no desire to raise a herd of heavies.”

“Nonsense!” Jinhua retorted with a laugh. “We’d never gorge ourselves into obesity. We care about appearances too, contrary to your exaggerations.”

Between mouthfuls, Guanyu countered, “Take Hanhan—she snacks nonstop from dawn till bedtime. I’d wager she even eats in her dreams! How could she not gain weight?”

Xue Jing rolled her eyes. “Not necessarily. Like Jones, Hanhan stays slim despite her appetite. Her curves remain perfectly proportioned—no weight gain at all. We’re all green with envy.”

Guanyu conceded the point. Apart from Hanhan, the other women ate sparingly, likely fearing weight gain. Yet Hanhan’s metabolism mirrored Jones’—a genetic blessing where gluttony didn’t translate to pounds.

**Chapter 2369: Vanishing Acts**

After the lavish meal, Guanyu addressed Jones: “I’ve a matter to discuss.”

Having finished eating, Jones nodded. “Speak freely. No need for formalities between us.”

“During my time at Kaihuang Academy, I founded a faction called the Yu Alliance. Are you aware of this?”

Jones recalled vague mentions from subordinates but had never prioritized it. “I’ve heard snippets. Why raise this now?”

“My prolonged absence risks the group dissolving. I wish to leverage your resources to elevate them beyond campus—forge a reputation.”

“Easily done,” Jones replied, sipping water. “You needn’t consult me—you’re already our organization’s leader. After last time, I publicly declared your authority. The Free Faction answers to you now.”

Guanyu detected subtle reproach in her tone—his leadership had been purely nominal, devoid of active involvement.

Jones’ discontent stemmed less from organizational neglect than personal estrangement. She’d anticipated renewed closeness upon their reunion, yet Guanyu remained aloof. Months would pass without visits, though she consoled herself with excuses about his busyness.

Though resentful, Jones accepted reality—her chosen man was no ordinary partner.

“I acknowledge my shortcomings,” Guanyu admitted. “Once my affairs conclude, we’ll retreat to an isolated haven, leaving worldly troubles behind.”

“A beautiful dream,” Jones sighed. “But ideals bow to reality. Can you truly halt your momentum?”

“I ask little—occasional visits would suffice. Yet you act as if I’m invisible.”

Xue Jing, sensing tension, interjected: “Jones, why not join us at Qiaoyuan District? You’d see Guanyu more often.”

“She won’t,” Guanyu predicted. “Her strong-willed nature forbids communal living.”

“Does my strength justify your neglect?” Jones challenged, half-seriously pressing her point to remain memorable.

Xue Jing mediated: “Our shared lover’s a philanderer. He scarcely stays at Qiaoyuan either—vanishing for days, phone silent. Recently he whisked some woman abroad without notice, causing chaos until the sisters summoned him back.”

Jones acknowledged this pattern. Her complaint was more lament than accusation. “I chose this path. Between organizational duties and his absences, I’ve learned to endure.”

“I’ll strive to be more attentive,” Guanyu conceded, eager to shift topics.

Xue Jing persisted: “If you persist in gallivanting, we’ll petition your sisters at Huayu Group for justice!”

Guanyu blanched—involving his elder sisters meant severe repercussions, possibly house arrest.

“Understood,” he surrendered. “I’ll reform.”

Xue Jing softened: “You’ve changed. Before, you’d inform Ah Mei if delayed. Now you vanish for days—we worry sick, phones unanswered. What mischief occupies you?”

Guanyu reflected. Indeed, circumstances had transformed him. Campus trivialities differed starkly from life-threatening societal conflicts. Protecting his women required fortress-like security at Qiaoyuan, leaving little room for domesticity. His recent focus on Jinhua—whose hidden status demanded discretion—had bred unintended neglect.

**Chapter 2370: Strength in Unity**

“Had Jones not raised this, I’d have stayed silent,” Xue Jing said carefully. “The sisters hoped you’d self-reflect.”

Guanyu sighed. “Multiple women prove more trouble than joy.”

Xue Jing teased: “Where’s your former glee in collecting beauties? Regret surfaces only now?”

Changing subjects, Guanyu addressed Jones: “Hou Jinshun—my capable aide—proposes merging his faction with yours. Your thoughts?”

Jones hesitated. “Integration challenges abound. Established hierarchies might clash with newcomers’ ambitions...”
