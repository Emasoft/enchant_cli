A hand grabbed Sun Zhi by the collar as Guan Yu swiftly closed the distance to Xie Yulu. Xie shuddered violently, shocked by Guan Yu's sudden appearance.

Chapter 2001: No Way to Live

Standing before Xie Yulu, Guan Yu's abrupt arrival sent tremors through her body. Yet he made no move to strike her—striking women being unwise unless confronting true evil.

"Trying to run? When you decided to oppose me, you should've foreseen this day," Guan Yu said with a chilling smile. He gestured to the bloodied Sun Zhi in his grip. "Care to join him?"

To everyone's astonishment, Xie Yulu collapsed to her knees, forehead thudding against concrete. "Master Guan! Grandfather! Spare me! I'll serve you like cattle—just let me live!"

"Spare you? Why should I?" Guan Yu's voice turned glacial.

When Xie failed to respond, Guan Yu tossed Sun Zhi's battered form at her feet. "Between you two, I'll spare one. You've got one minute to decide."

"Make way!" A woman's urgent cry pierced the air as Qian Yunqing entered with Qian Yaoyao to check on Wei Hongwei's injuries. Though bruised, Wei waved off concerns. Watching Qian Yaoyao fuss over him, Qian Yunqing approached Guan Yu.

"Brother, your timely aid turned the tide today," Guan Yu acknowledged.

Qian waved off the gratitude. "Friends need no thanks. Besides, had anything happened to my brother-in-law here..." He winced as Qian Yaoyao pinched his back. "Watch your tongue!"

In the classroom, Lü Mei finally unclenched her sweat-slicked palms. With Sun Zhi captured, the crisis had passed—yet her heart remained troubled. She yearned for Guan Yu's commitment yet feared the violence shadowing their lives.

On the field, Guan Yu addressed the cowed pair. "Time's up. Your decision?"

Xie Yulu glared at Sun Zhi's mangled form. "I beg you—I was merely his pawn! Let me go!"

"You... bitch," Sun Zhi rasped. Ignoring him, Xie kept kowtowing.

Guan Yu observed Sun's stubborn defiance. "Very well. Sever his Achilles tendons, and I'll spare you."

Xie hesitated only momentarily before yanking the dagger from Sun's thigh. The blade flashed across his ankle. Sun's agonized howl rent the air as tendons snapped.

"Xie Yulu! I'll kill you!" Sun roared through gritted teeth.

"Seems he's still displeased," Guan Yu remarked coldly. "Finish the job."

When both Achilles tendons were severed, Sun finally collapsed unconscious. Xie discarded the bloody dagger. "Now release me!"

"One last condition," Guan Yu countered. "Cut your own tendons."

As Xie raised the blade to her ankle, Guan Yu suddenly kicked the dagger away. "Changed my mind. Carve two lines on your face instead."

The color drained from Xie's features. Marring her beauty was death itself. After anguished deliberation, she pleaded: "Any other price!"

Guan Yu relented. "Disappear forever. Cross my path again, and you'll regret breathing."

Xie scrambled up only to collapse—nerves deadened from prolonged kneeling. Supported by the loyal Xia Jinhua, she limped away, a broken shadow.

Chapter 2002: Three Hundred Pounds

Guan Yu turned to Wei Hongwei, still canoodling with Qian Yaoyao. "Enough! Document every traitor's name. They'll answer to me."

As night fell, Guan Yu reviewed news footage of the campus clash—now viral online. The doorbell interrupted his viewing.

Xue Jing answered to reveal a policewoman friend newly transferred to City A's headquarters. Her melodic voice preceded her entrance—a beauty stepping into the lamplight.

Meanwhile, in a luxury suite, Li Yuan lounged between buxom women. Across from them sat a mountainous figure—Ma Hai, the 300-pound crime lord known as "Sea Master."

"Deal with this high schooler, Sea Master," Li implored. "He's an unpredictable异能者 (supernatural being)."

Ma Hai grunted, a woman bobbing between his thighs. "Pathetic—needing help against a teenager." Yet the promise of fresh entertainment appealed. "Fine. Bring him to me."

Chapter 2003: Seeking Assistance

Li Yuan's family operated a humble diner—his schoolyard dominance solely through Ma Hai's patronage. Now fearing Guan Yu's wrath after Sun Zhi's downfall, Li gambled everything on this alliance.

Three specially selected courtesans attended to Ma Hai's peculiar tastes. As their ministrations peaked, the crime lord finally nodded. "I'll crush your little problem."

The plan crystallized: Lure Guan Yu into solitary combat, avoiding his supernatural allies. For Ma Hai—a near-Demiurge level异能者 (supernatural entity)—this would be sport.

Back on campus, the Yu Gang's legend grew. Hundreds flocked to join, basking in reflected glory. Yet Guan Yu's thoughts lingered on absent enemies—particularly the vanished Li Yuan.

As midnight approached, the stage was set for a clash that would shake A City's underworld—a battle between rising star and entrenched power, with the fate of开皇高校 (Kaihuang Academy) hanging in the balance.
