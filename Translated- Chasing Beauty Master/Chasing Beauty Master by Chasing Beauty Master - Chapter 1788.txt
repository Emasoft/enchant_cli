Guan Yu's expression was one of astonishment. This old man was anything but ordinary. The few movements he'd displayed already marked him as a master. By mainland China's martial rankings, Guan Yu estimated the man to be at least a First-Class Supreme expert.

Against such a formidable opponent, even Guan Yu wouldn't find victory easy, let alone two young women on the platform. The old man had effortlessly dodged Xiaomei's spells through sheer speed alone—a feat Guan Yu found staggering. In all his years wandering the jianghu, he'd never encountered such prowess except in himself.

The old man stood motionless as before, sneering coldly. "A mere cultivator dares act recklessly before me? Perhaps it might be possible, but sadly..." His gaze shifted to the noble lady beside them. "This fair flower lacks the capacity to grant you sufficient time for spellcasting."

Xiaomei stood frozen in dismay. Cultivators were neither welcomed nor respected here. Her identity now exposed yet her efforts fruitless, she found herself at a loss. Miss Dong's expression darkened further, her delicate features tightening with anxiety.

The old man chuckled. "Even combined, you two pose no threat. Will you both consent to become my brides? Hahaha!" His eyes glittered with excitement. Acquiring two such beauties today would be a double blessing indeed.

Pointing at the embroidered ball atop the wooden pillar, he continued languidly, "Were I to will it, that token could be mine in the blink of an eye. Does anyone here truly believe they can stop me? The esteemed Dong family—renowned throughout Camel Town—wouldn't dishonor their reputation by breaking promises, surely?"

From his distant position, Guan Yu gestured for Xiaomei to descend. This affair was beyond their intervention. The old man's formidable presence and calculated arrival suggested deeper schemes at play—troubles best avoided.

Xiaomei's finger jabbed accusingly at Guan Yu. "Have you no conscience? Will you stand idle while injustice unfolds? Can't you devise a solution? Must we watch Miss Dong wed this ancient lecher?"

Guan Yu grimaced. His attempt to withdraw had backfired spectacularly. "Cease this meddling and come down at once," he urged, frustration coloring his tone.

Miss Dong's gaze followed Xiaomei's gesture, locking eyes with Guan Yu before noticing Siqi beside him. Her brow furrowed. The woman accompanying this young master possessed ethereal beauty that outshone even her own vailed charms. In Camel Town, Miss Dong reigned as undisputed first beauty—until today's encounter with these two radiant strangers.

"Enough delays," Guan Yu pressed. "We've matters to attend." He saw no reason to involve himself in the Dong family's affairs. Their wealth and influence could surely resolve this through silver if necessary. Meddling might only invite greater complications.

"What if Miss Dong truly must marry that old man?" Siqi's sudden query startled him. "Guan Yu, could you defeat him?"

"What are you implying?" he retorted, irritation rising. "This isn't our concern. That elder clearly has backing. Interference might—"

"But can we ignore such injustice?" Siqi's eyes blazed with determination. "Dislodge him swiftly, then we depart with clear consciences." Her stance suggested she'd charge forth herself if refused.

Before Guan Yu could respond, the old man sprang into motion. With practiced qinggong steps, he ascended toward the embroidered ball—only to recoil as a dagger materialized beneath the prize, its hilt quivering in the wood where his hand had nearly been impaled.

The old man's wild hair whipped as he faced Guan Yu. "To think another master lurked among the rabble. My oversight."

Guan Yu's thrown dagger still vibrated in the pillar. Reluctantly compelled by Siqi's plea, he'd intervened. This elder reeked of ulterior motives—whether vendetta against the Dongs or power plays mattered not. Having acted, Guan Yu must now see this through.

"Young man," the elder mocked, "why meddle in spectators' affairs? Unless..." His lecherous gaze found Siqi. "Ah! Another jewel hidden in the crowd! Truly, fortune smiles upon me today."

Xiaomei brightened at Guan Yu's involvement, while Siqi sighed in relief. Guan Yu's jaw tightened at the elder's brazen appraisal of his companion.

"Your purpose here holds no interest," Guan Yu stated coldly. "Withdraw while you can."

The elder spread his hands. "Should I abandon such prizes for mere words? The Dongs erected this challenge—any victor claims the reward. Age matters not where skill prevails. These men..." He gestured contemptuously at the crowd. "...cry foul only because they lack capability. What man wouldn't desire both beauty and influence?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through onlookers. Guan Yu privately acknowledged the truth in the words—the contest's rules made no mention of age restrictions.

"Since you've chosen involvement," the elder declared, "let us settle this properly. No more skulking in shadows."

With dignity, Guan Yu swept Siqi's waist and vaulted onto the platform. Approaching Xiaomei, he muttered, "I never marked you for a troublemaker." To Miss Dong, he inclined his head. "Observe from safety. I'll measure this elder's mettle."

Though long unaccustomed to pure martial combat in this cultivation-dominated era, Guan Yu felt the familiar thrill of challenge. His Luo Hun Blade gleamed as he faced the elder, suppressing spiritual energy in favor of martial qi. Even the dregs of his sealed power, combined with peerless experience and his legendary blade, should suffice.

Chapter 4679: Masters Collide

The elder's eyes widened at the unsheathing of Luo Hun Blade—its otherworldly craftsmanship suggesting mystical origins beyond mere weaponry. Guan Yu's arm blurred, the blade sheathed in golden qi as he closed the distance impossibly fast.

Steel shrieked as blade met staff in sparking collision. Guan Yu's follow-up swing met empty air—the elder materializing behind him with staff thrusting at his skull. A reverse slash deflected the strike, their weapons clashing in rapid succession.

Spectators gasped as two-meter qi arcs erupted from Guan Yu's blade, forcing the elder into frantic evasion. Internal energy projection—a technique requiring mastery beyond First-Class Supreme! The elder's composure cracked momentarily before reasserting control.

Their dance continued—Guan Yu's unpredictable attacks countered by the elder's phantom movements. When Luo Hun Blade finally connected fully, instead of shearing through wood, it sparked against metal core. Both combatants disengaged, breathing slightly labored.

"Your throwing dagger showed promise," the elder panted, "but hiding your qi? Remarkable."

Guan Yu smiled grimly. "Mountains beyond mountains, elders beyond elders." His blade hummed with gathering power. "Shall we conclude this?"
