“Elder Jiu speaks wisely. I acted impulsively,” Chief Lu admitted, though his agitation still lingered from the earlier revelation about the Boundary Sovereign Relic.

Elder Jiu pressed further, “As I understand, whoever consumes the Boundary Sovereign Relic absorbs its power, potentially ascending to Boundary Sovereign mastery. Guanyu, what became of the man you saved? Share the full account.”

“You’re correct, Elder,” Guanyu replied. “After ingesting the relic, his cultivation surged dramatically. He’d been clinically dead when I found him – another had expended their life’s energy to preserve his heart meridian in an ice vault. When I administered the relic, his body couldn’t absorb it naturally. I channeled energy to help assimilate the relic’s power, barely snatching him from death’s grasp.”

“But you’ve lost all internal energy,” Elder Jiu probed, brow furrowed. “How could you assist such a process?”

Guanyu explained, “Though most of my cultivation remains sealed after the amnesia, a fraction persists. Elder, are you aware that Boundary Sovereign masters possess prescient abilities?”

“This is news to me,” Elder Jiu mused. “Those who reach such heights guard their secrets closely. None I’ve met spoke of this.”

“During my former mastery,” Guanyu continued, “I visited a neighboring kingdom and befriended a maiden. Before departing on a perilous mission, I left her an artifact – a golden dagger engraved with talismanic patterns – instructing her to seek me if I didn’t return. A year later, her brother tracked me down. Both Master and Martial Uncle Lu have met this swordsman.”

“Ah!” Xuanming interjected. “The long-blade warrior following you? His cultivation is formidable indeed.”

Guanyu nodded. “When he found me amnesiac, he arranged a meeting with his sister. She returned the dagger – its surface covered in mystical runes that...”

“Foolhardy boy!” Chief Lu burst out. “Meeting strangers while vulnerable? You’d risk deception for a woman’s summons?”

Xuanming glared. “Martial Brother Lu! Must you interrupt continually? Let him finish!”

Undeterred, Guanyu pressed on: “My friend versed in demonic scripts identified the dagger’s engravings as a formation array. We thought it might unlock my seals, but activation backfired catastrophically. When I awoke, every shred of internal energy had been devoured by the seal.”

“Remarkable,” Elder Jiu murmured. “This living seal capriciously consumes or spares energy. Almost... sentient.”

Elder Jiu pondered the anomaly. “The initial seal claimed most cultivation and memories. The secondary seal only took residual energy yet spared recollection. Why this discrepancy?”

“I believe the dagger’s misused array altered the seal’s behavior,” Guanyu theorized. “Previously, I could cultivate normally despite the seal. Now, any generated energy gets immediately absorbed.”

“Precisely,” Elder Jiu concurred. “Were the seal elsewhere, we might attempt removal. But anchored in your brain? Any misstep could prove fatal.”

Xuanming leaned forward. “Surely there’s another way?”

“Questioning my judgment, Martial Nephew?” Elder Jiu’s voice turned glacial. “Shall I conjure another Boundary Sovereign Relic?”

Xuanming bowed deeply. “This junior overstepped. Forgive me.” Guanyu noted the suffocating hierarchy at play.

“This dagger,” Elder Jiu resumed, “may hold the key. Left presciently before your mission, it suggests Boundary Sovereigns indeed glimpse destiny. The demonic patterns imply your past mastery of their arrays – crucial for a seal of demonic origin.”

Guanyu nodded. “Though my memories are fractured, this connection seems undeniable. The dagger remains with my friend studying its engravings.”

“Then we’re at fate’s mercy,” Chief Lu sighed, still smarting over the wasted relic. “First squandering divine relics, now entrusting vital artifacts to others – such recklessness!”

Xuanming intervened: “Elder Jiu, perhaps examine the dagger later? I recall your expertise in demonic arrays.”

“Superficial knowledge at best,” the elder demurred. “But I’ll consult if it’s presented.”

Guanyu remained guarded – these elders wouldn’t part with relics, nor should they handle the dagger. Their curiosity might seize it indefinitely.

Changing tack, Xuanming produced the Emperor’s Seal. “We seek your aid imbuing four high-tier spells into this artifact. For Guanyu’s protection.”

Elder Jiu examined the relic. “The legendary Emperor’s Seal! Capable of storing four independent spells – rare even among immortal tools. Why does a mountaintop disciple need such power?”

“After the Six Peaks Assembly,” Xuanming revealed, “he’ll combat demonic sects. This ensures survival.”

The elder sighed. “Infusing external spells requires exhausting channeling – weeks of recovery per spell. For another’s artifact? Grueling work.”

“We implore you,” Xuanming pressed. “Consider it a favor to our sect.”

Elder Jiu relented. “Reduced potency spells could allow four infusions in twenty days.”

Guanyu bowed. “My deepest gratitude, Elder.”

“Nonsense!” Chief Lu grumbled. “Any spell from you surpasses ours. Don’t strain yourself.”

“Fool!” Elder Jiu snapped. “My reputation rides on these spells! They’ll bear my signature!”

As apologies volleyed, Guanyu marveled at their vanity. The elder’s pride became his advantage – stronger spells for his arsenal.

When tea arrived, negotiations concluded. The Emperor’s Seal changed hands, its future glowing with Elder Jiu’s potent magics. Guanyu hid a smile – vanity and hierarchy could be manipulated. For now, survival was assured.
