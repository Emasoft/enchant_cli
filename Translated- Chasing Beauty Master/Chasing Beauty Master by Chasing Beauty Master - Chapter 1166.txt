“It seems I’m not meant to stay here. Guan Yu is the bane of my existence. As for the Feng family’s affairs, I can no longer involve myself. Let this be the end.” Bill Lin rose slowly, his face haggard.

His words struck fear into Young Master Feng, who hastily pleaded, “Bill Lin, you can’t abandon our family! We’re still struggling to stabilize. If you leave, what will become of us?”

If Bill Lin truly departed, Guan Yu would undoubtedly crush the Feng family. The only reason Guan Yu hadn’t yet moved against them was Bill Lin’s presence as a shield.

Without him, Young Master Feng feared Guan Yu would storm their gates within days.

Bill Lin shook his head weakly. “I’m exhausted. My heart is no longer in this. The Feng family’s fate now lies in your own hands. I can’t continue battling Guan Yu—my spirit is broken. I can’t endure another defeat.”

His resolute decision to leave left Young Master Feng frantic yet powerless. Never had he imagined Bill Lin, once so indomitable, would crumble after repeated clashes with Guan Yu.

Unaware of Bill Lin’s impending departure, Guan Yu focused on the courtroom where Lawyer Fu, renowned for his sharp wit, dismantled Lai Huangsi’s defense with ruthless precision.

The verdict came swiftly: Lai Huangsi faced heavy fines for his crimes. As the sole beneficiary of the case, Guan Yu watched as the desperate Lai turned to Young Master Feng for aid.

Trapped, Young Master Feng couldn’t afford the fines himself. He sought Bill Lin’s help, but the latter, already packing to leave, refused involvement.

Lai Huangsi then threatened to expose both Young Master Feng and Bill Lin unless the Feng family paid his penalties. Bill Lin remained unperturbed—as a foreigner nearing his return home, he felt untouchable.

Young Master Feng, however, faced ruin. The Feng family’s dwindling profits made the fines crippling. Worse, Lai’s volatility meant he might betray them regardless.

In a misguided attempt, Young Master Feng tried bribing Lawyer Fu, only to have the upright lawyer submit the bribery evidence to court. This escalated the penalties, forcing the Feng family to drain their coffers to keep Lai from prison—a fate Guan Yu had cleverly avoided by prioritizing fines over incarceration.

When news of Bill Lin’s departure reached Guan Yu, he smirked. After countless confrontations, his rival’s surrender felt anticlimactic. Yet Guan Yu had no intention of letting Bill Lin slip away quietly. He devised a trap: releasing another fragment of the legendary treasure map.

Meanwhile, Young Master Feng languished in his room, unshaven and gaunt. The Feng family’s factories—textile, plastics, steel—teetered on collapse as orders vanished. Old allies like Lai Huangsi severed ties, dragging others with them. The family’s brief resurgence had crumbled overnight.

**Chapter 2998: Grand Opening**

With the Feng patriarch retired to their ancestral estate, Young Master Feng alone shouldered the family’s crumbling empire. He knew exposing themselves to Guan Yu’s wrath meant annihilation. Bill Lin’s presence, though costly, had been their shield. Without him, the Fengs would follow the doomed Fang family into oblivion.

Guan Yu, however, pondered deeper currents. How could the martial world let Bill Lin leave with three treasure map fragments? His answer came via Du Guafu (Venomous Widow), who leaked Bill Lin’s plans to force the Jianghu’s hand. Her motive: keeping her lover Luo Bo from departing.

**Chapter 2999: Spectacle**

The revelation coincided with the grand reopening of Yang Conghan’s Night Blossom Club. Throngs gathered, lured by free-flowing drinks, golden membership cards, and the club owner’s famed beauty. Draped in a couture gown resembling “clouds brushed by sunlight,” Yang descended the staircase arm-in-arm with Guan Yu—a vision of power and elegance that hushed the crowd.

Her marketing genius shone: limited-edition memberships, strategic discounts, and a night of revelry designed to cement loyalty. Yet beneath the glitter, tensions simmered. A commotion erupted as a disheveled man accused a muscular patron of stepping on his pristine white sneakers—a trivial spark that threatened the evening’s carefully orchestrated harmony.

“Watch where you’re stompin’, ya big oaf!” the scrappy Northeasterner barked, fingers twisted in the taller man’s collar. “Ain’t yer mama teach ya to ’pologize?”

Laughter rippled through the crowd at his thick accent. Guan Yu moved to intervene, Yang trailing gracefully behind. The absurd scene—a wiry old-timer confronting a gym-built giant—epitomized the night’s precarious balance between opulence and chaos.
