“Ah, this matter’s success is largely due to Young Master Feng’s contributions,” Bill Lin said, retrieving his checkbook and scribbling two checks. “If not for the powerful allies he brought, we couldn’t have resolved things so smoothly. I won’t let your efforts go unrewarded.”

One check was for Sun Xu, the other for Lai Huangsi. Grinning broadly, Bill Lin declared, “All we need now is to wait until the appointed day to demand payment from Guan Yu. Hahaha! Just thinking about it lifts my spirits. This is truly exhilarating!”

Sun Xu glanced at the amount—a million. Though not astronomical, it was substantial, especially after his long drought of funds from Bill Lin’s coffers. He nodded in approval.

**Chapter 2976: It’s Always Him Who Suffers**

While the plan’s success indeed hinged on Young Master Feng’s role, Bill Lin couldn’t suppress his irritation toward the man. Feng’s habitual stinginess—never offering a cent to share burdens—rankled him deeply.

Yet Young Master Feng remained troubled. Guan Yu, shrewd as he was, surrounded by equally astute women—how could he have fallen for such an obvious trap? Had complacency blinded him?

Even the greenest merchant would smell a rat when a massive client materialized out of thin air. Guan Yu’s oversight defied logic. Past schemes, far subtler, had unraveled under his scrutiny. This crude contract, lopsided and unrealistic—how could Guan Yu’s team have signed it without safeguards? Something reeked of deception.

Noticing Feng’s dour expression, Bill Lin chuckled, mistaking it for financial envy. “Young Master Feng! Shouldn’t you rejoice in our triumph over Guan Yu?”

“Rejoice?” Feng sneered. “After being outwitted countless times? This is mere luck.”

Unfazed by the barb, Bill Lin spread his arms. “Ah, but this isn’t just victory—it’s redemption! One strike recouping all losses from Guan Yu. Doesn’t that thrill you?”

Feng rose, dismissive. “Celebrate when the money’s in hand, not before. Your crowing’s premature.” He strode toward his chambers, preferring carnal distractions over futile pondering. Last night’s new acquisition awaited proper...appreciation.

Bill Lin jabbed a finger at Feng’s retreating figure. “Is he even on our side? Spouting nonsense that aids Guan Yu! What rotten thoughts fester in that skull?”

Sun Xu interjected smoothly, “His nature’s always been thus. He abstains from our ventures yet carps when excluded from profits. Let him grumble.”

Truthfully, even Bill Lin harbored doubts. After repeated humiliations by Guan Yu, this sudden windfall felt surreal. He’d scrutinized the tannery contract endlessly, even consulting lawyers. All confirmed its validity: failure to deliver specified quantities meant tenfold compensation. Reassured, he awaited payday.

Over subsequent days, Sun Xu’s men pilfered three tons of premium leather—a staggering haul. Bill Lin, luxuriating on his sofa during progress reports, radiated magnanimity. Even the venomous Widow Ma exploited his mood, extracting concessions while he focused on ruining Guan Yu’s tannery first. The assault on Ma Tong’s territories could wait.

The Feng estate buzzed with celebration. One evening, Bill Lin hosted a lavish banquet, inviting even the recently returned Ge Yinglai—Sun Xu’s recommendation, citing potential usefulness.

Amidst wine and women, Sun Xu addressed Bill Lin: “A matter requires your attention. Our stolen leather overflows the initial warehouse. Shouldn’t we find buyers? It’s worthless to us.”

Ge Yinglai seized the opening: “Let me handle sales. Overseas connections from my travels can turn profit. A modest commission suffices.”

Bill Lin waved expansively. “Keep all proceeds. Burn it for all I care—just keep it from that tannery!”

“Gratitude, Young Master Bill!” Ge Yinglai bowed.

Earlier, Sun Xu had learned Ge’s overseas surgery—a million-dollar foot transplant using donor tissue—restored his mobility. Now eyeing similar treatment, Sun Xu planned to fund his own procedure after selling the leather. With two million nearly secured, freedom from his wheelchair beckoned.

**Chapter 2977: The Garbage Truck**

While the Feng reveled, Guan Yu strategized. In the tannery’s surveillance room, Jing Boyan replayed footage: a garbage truck entering, workers loading wrapped leather amidst refuse. Guards waved it through unchecked.

“They disguise stolen goods as trash,” Jing explained, handing Guan Yu a flash drive. “Footage from past days—all here.”

In Wang Hu’s office, Guan Yu ordered: “Tail that truck tomorrow. Track its destination.”

“Understood,” Wang Hu vowed.

Next day, three vehicles rotated pursuit to avoid detection. The truck stopped at a rural junkyard, then transferred contraband to a red-gated compound. Wang Hu photographed Sun Xu arriving by Audi, wheelchair-bound, inspecting goods.

“Confirmed,” Wang Hu reported via phone. “Leather stored south suburbs. Photos evidence everything.”

“Return immediately,” Guan Yu ordered. “We’re alerting police.”

**Chapter 2978: Tread Carefully**

Post-call, Guan Yu frowned. Xue Jing noticed. “What’s wrong?”

“We must act before they sell the leather. Evidence could vanish.”

“Then call Lin Qiaoqiao!”

When Officer Lin arrived, she flirted brazenly with Guan Yu before Xue Jing’s narrowed eyes. “Careful,” Lin purred, ignoring her friend’s glare. “Unattached men are fair game. Guard your treasure, Xue Jing.”

As Guan Yu briefed the police, tensions simmered—between justice’s course and tangled hearts.
