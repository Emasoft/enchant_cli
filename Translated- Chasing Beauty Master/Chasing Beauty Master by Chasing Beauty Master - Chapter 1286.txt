Siki had already begun channeling her spells when Lin Chen suddenly called for a pause. With so many spectators present, she believed he wouldn't dare play tricks. She halted her movements, awaiting his explanation.

"Master," Lin Chen said helplessly to Xuanming, "Do you honestly think I can withstand that artifact in her hands? I might as well forfeit now rather than humiliate myself."

Xuanming's expression mirrored his disciple's resignation. Truthfully, Lin Chen stood no chance against Siki. Without intervention, this duel would become mere target practice for the young woman. Seeing his master's silent acquiescence, Lin Chen understood the unspoken verdict - this battle was lost before it began.

**Chapter 3309: Expressing Gratitude**

Raising his hand, Lin Chen proposed, "Siki, dare you face me without using that artifact? I'll likewise refrain from artifacts. What say you?"

"You shameless coward!" shouted a disciple from Convergence Peak below. "Since when do we restrict artifacts in duels? Should we all use standard Cloudgreen Swords for 'fairness'?"

"Exactly!" another jeered. "Xiao Zhi from Hanging Peak used his own artifact earlier. Are you saying we should confiscate personal weapons now?"

The arena erupted in taunts, Convergence Peak disciples leading the chorus of ridicule. Lin Chen winced under the verbal onslaught, finally waving his hands in surrender. "Enough! I misspoke. I forfeit - isn't that sufficient?"

The crowd's derision chased him from the platform before blades could clash. Guanyu watched bemused - what he'd anticipated as a thrilling duel evaporated like morning mist. Siki's Jade Ruyi had elevated her beyond ordinary competition, though Guanyu noted the artifact's unstable aura. "She must master its energy fluctuations," he mused. "Such potent emissions would attract vultures in the outside world."

**Chapter 3310: No Contest**

As Xuanming announced Siki's victory, the ice queen turned unexpectedly toward Guanyu, executing a graceful bow that left spectators buzzing. Only Guanyu understood - this was gratitude for the Jade Ruyi gifted months earlier at the Ancestral Shrine. Their discreet exchange kindled fresh gossip about the pair's relationship.

The subsequent match saw Guanyu facing Xiaolian of Convergence Peak. He materialized two legendary artifacts - the Emperor's Seal in his left hand, Soulfall Blade gleaming in his right. The crowd's envy crackled like summer lightning.

"Must you flaunt such treasures against me?" Xiaolian pouted, though her eyes betrayed calculation. "Is this fair?"

Guanyu countered evenly, "You've trained decades here. I arrived two months ago. Without these, how could I hope to compete?"

As debates about fairness raged below, Sect Masters exchanged meaningful glances. Wood Peak's leader stared hungrily at the artifacts, while Xuanming sighed at his disciple's ostentation. "Revealing all one's cards..." the Sect Master murmured, shaking his head.

**Chapter 3311: Grandstanding**

Among the spectators, Zheng Peak's leader philosophized: "Destiny favors some beyond merit. Observe how Guanyu wields treasures others spend lifetimes seeking." His disciple A'ze nodded ruefully, "We can't compare. He's peerless."

Xiao Zhi's booming voice cut through: "Who cares? When Guanyu rises, we'll bask in reflected glory!" His subsequent wince under female glares suggested this wisdom came too late.

On the platform, Xiaolian's tactical pout faded before Guanyu's implacable stance. Convergence Peak's Dai Shouzuo watched knowingly - this match was theater. Guanyu's physique alone, forged through Boundary Sovereign cultivation, could overpower opponents without qi enhancement. The artifacts? Merely insurance against accidents.

As Wood Peak's leader marveled at Xuanming's lavish gifting, the Sect Master himself wrestled with mixed pride and concern. Below them, the crowd's whispers coalesced into realization - they witnessed not just a duel, but the anointing of Cloudgreen Sect's future.
