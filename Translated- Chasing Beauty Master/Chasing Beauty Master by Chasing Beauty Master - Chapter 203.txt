With a mischievous grin curling his lips, Guan Yu's gaze lingered unabashedly on the exposed portion of Gao Wei's snow-white d√©colletage, his expression so openly lecherous that one might wonder who would ultimately subdue whom in this contest of wills.

If stares could kill, Guan Yu would have perished countless times over.

"Drive." The words squeezed through Gao Wei's clenched teeth as she teetered on the edge of eruption.

Left unchecked, Guan Yu's brazen ogling might unleash his beastly nature before they even reached the villa. The specter of a "car scandal" loomed large - such notoriety would undoubtedly propel him to instant infamy.

Her anxiety deepened as she considered what fresh horrors might await at their destination. If he behaved thus in the car, what depravities might manifest within the villa's walls?

"Where's Xiaojuan?" Gao Wei grasped at this sudden solution, clinging to the belief that Guan Yu wouldn't dare misbehave before Du Xiaojuan.

"Forgot her phone when she went out. She'll find her own way back." Guan Yu shrugged as the engine roared to life, his nonchalance fueling Gao Wei's growing wariness.

Sensing her hostile glare, Guan Yu turned with deliberate provocation, his eyes lingering on her chest. "So little faith in me?"

Gao Wei crossed her arms protectively and nodded vigorously.

Her schoolgirl demeanor amused Guan Yu despite himself. "Too late to disembark now, little stowaway," he growled with mock menace.

Truthfully, he hadn't brought his phone either - awakened by Wang Zhen's call about becoming N City's latest scandal, he'd rushed out in such haste that mundane details slipped his mind. But explanations seemed futile against Gao Wei's entrenched suspicion.

Tears of frustration pricked Gao Wei's eyes as Guan Yu's tyranny reached new heights. Parking in the garage, he rounded the vehicle to yank open her door and sweep her into his arms without ceremony.

Gao Wei thrashed against his chest, small fists pounding as she threatened, "Don't you dare-"

"Dare what?" Guan Yu teased mercilessly.

"I'll... I'll bite you!" Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she squirmed in his embrace, the unfamiliar intimacy of male contact setting her nerves aflame. This marked her second time in his arms, yet the proximity remained profoundly disquieting.

"Bite away," he challenged.

A sharp hiss escaped Guan Yu as teeth sank into his shoulder. Clad only in a white dress shirt after discarding the ill-fitting suit jacket meant for Bo Jie, he'd left himself vulnerable to this counterattack.

"Dog reincarnated?" He glared down at his assailant. "Told you to bite and you actually do it?"

"Put. Me. Down." The words emerged muffled against his flesh.

"Barefoot in winter? You'd freeze those jade feet." His explanation came belatedly, the pain subsiding as her jaw slackened - perhaps finally recognizing his actual motive.

Gao Wei's discarded shoes lay forgotten, casualties of their earlier flight. "I'd rather freeze than endure your perverted embrace!" she retorted stubbornly, refusing to concede error lest it embolden further liberties.

Though her defiance remained, its vigor had diminished. Guan Yu chuckled, adjusting his grip on her supple form. The exquisite contours fitting against him too perfectly to relinquish.

Compelling her to fish keys from his pocket, he carried her through the villa's entrance. As predicted, Du Xiaojuan's absence left them in solitary splendor.

Depositing Gao Wei on the sofa, he fetched fleece-lined slippers before collapsing beside her. His peripheral vision caught her limping gait, brows knitted in silent suffering.

"My doing?" Guan Yu frowned when confronted about her injury.

"Who else?" she snapped, massaging bruised knees that only now revealed their true anguish.

Recollection dawned - their headlong flight down stairs, a careless collision with railings during their escape from prying eyes. "Let me examine it," he offered.

Gao Wei's tearful glare answered before words could. The severity became apparent through his enhanced perception - mottled purple blooms beneath skin, tendons and bones compromised. Left untreated, months of lameness loomed.

As he reached for her skirt hem, she clutched the fabric like a besieged fortress. "Beast!"

"Persist, and I'll show you true beastliness," he warned.

Chapter 504: White Skirt, Jade Feet, Fair Legs

Her lips whitened under determined teeth, martyrdom writ large in every tense line. Guan Yu sighed, withdrawing. "The injury's serious. I have some medical skill."

Skepticism radiated from her guarded posture. "You'd treat a bruise?"

"Any ailment," he vowed. "Not a scar will remain."

The promise of unmarred beauty swayed her. Slowly, death-grip on fabric loosened.

Gently lifting her legs onto his lap, the silk whisper of calves against wool set his pulse racing. Even through layers, their perfection intoxicated - sculpted yet yielding, a masterwork of feminine grace.

As the skirt inched upward, jade feet emerged in their full glory - porcelain purity veined with life's azure tributaries. Against all reason, his fingers traced their arch, cold satin under warm touch.

"What are you doing?" Her blush deepened to carnation hues.

"Admiring art," he murmured hoarsely, reluctantly withdrawing to address the mottled knee. The revealed thigh's alabaster splendor nearly undid him - and the glimpse of white lace beneath...

Focus, he chastised himself, fingertips brushing injured flesh. Her sharp inhale mirrored his own as healing energy flowed between them.

When his lips suddenly claimed hers, time fractured.

Chapter 506: Brothers in Misfortune

In this fame-obsessed era where some court notoriety through any means, Guan Yu represented the antithesis - one who understood the perils of prominence. Yesterday's scandal already made him N City's favorite gossip fodder; today's theatrics risked immortalizing him as the student who stole their campus goddess.

As Gao Wei's teeth revisited his shoulder with renewed vigor, Guan Yu contemplated the irony - his supposed "beastly" nature currently playing nursemaid to the very woman determined to cast him as villain.

The Xiang Family Private Kitchen's exclusive ambiance did little to soothe his nerves. Chauffeur, bodyguard, now ersatz escort - Guan Yu marveled at how effortlessly Gao Wei commandeered his days. Her gloved hand in his as they approached the restaurant, winter roses blooming on her cheeks, he couldn't decide whether to curse fate or thank it.
