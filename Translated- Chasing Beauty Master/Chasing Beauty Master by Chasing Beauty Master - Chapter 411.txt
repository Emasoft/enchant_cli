“Don’t cry anymore, I won’t hit you… I’m saying, if you stop crying, I’ll do whatever you want…”

His words only made Dongfang Huowu (Flame Dance) cry harder.

“Damn it, Jiang Ziqi! Get over here and help!”

Jiang Ziqi, who had been watching the scene with amusement, teased: “Young Master Guan, you’re the one who made her cry. How could I possibly comfort her? Maybe let her hit you twice in return?”

“What kind of bullshit idea is that…”

Before he finished, Guan Yu noticed Dongfang Huowu had stopped crying. Her teary eyes glared at him. “You… You wouldn’t actually want payback, would you?”

“Didn’t you say you’d do anything I wanted?” She blinked, grinding her little canine teeth.

“Hell no! We can negotiate anything else, but this is impossible!” Guan Yu pushed her away. As a grown man, letting a girl spank him? Unthinkable!

A crowd began gathering, asking Dongfang Huowu what happened.

“Third Uncle! He molested me!” She tugged at a seventy-year-old man’s sleeve.

The old man scrutinized Guan Yu. “Is this true?”

Jiang Ziqi leaned in, expecting Guan Yu’s defense. Instead, the young man replied calmly: “Do I look like a hooligan? As you see, our cars had a minor collision. That’s why this lady misunderstood me.” Guan Yu’s expression radiated innocence, purer than a newborn lamb.

Third Uncle nodded. Everyone knew this family treasure wouldn’t let anyone harass her without crippling them first. Cutting off Dongfang Huowu’s protests, he asked: “Why are you two here?”

Though the Dongfang family wielded power, they avoided bullying. Jiang Ziqi’s humble car bore a military plate with a prominent “Army” prefix – these youths weren’t ordinary.

“We came to visit Brother Dongfang Mu…”

As Jiang Ziqi spoke, Dongfang Mu himself approached. Spotting Guan Yu, he frowned: “Guan Yu? Why are you here?”

Hearing the name, Third Uncle’s eyes narrowed curiously. Dongfang Huowu flushed crimson beneath her thick makeup, though no one noticed.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “Brother Dongfang, didn’t you tell me to come today?”

Dongfang Mu slapped his forehead. “Right! I meant to call you after reaching the city. Since you’re here, let’s go to my home.”

Their damaged cars were taken for repairs. Given Dongfang Mu’s involvement, the family ignored the collision incident. As for the alleged molestation? No one believed it.

“Little Wu, join us if you’re free.”

“I’m free! I’m…” Dongfang Huowu bit her tongue, surprised by her own eagerness.

The Dongfang ancestral compound, over 130 years old, boasted antique stones and timbers. Dongfang Mu’s residence crowned the village’s highest point – a sprawling courtyard mansion with glazed golden tiles and vermilion walls, fit for royalty even in ancient times.

Guan Yu whistled. “Brother Dongfang, this looks like a prince’s manor!”

“It was. My great-great-grandfather received it from the emperor as an honorary prince.” Dongfang Huowu rolled her eyes.

“How was I supposed to know?” Guan Yu shrugged. The Dongfang princely heritage was common knowledge in the capital – except to him.

“Country bumpkin!” she huffed.

Capital elites said: If you don’t know the Songs, your business isn’t big enough. If you don’t know the Dongfangs, you lack class. Beyond political influence, the family led artistic trends through Dongfang Mu – an artistic luminary whose design firms shaped luxury interiors across the city. A Dongfang-designed home doubled property values.

“Yes yes, you’re not bumpkin – just a nonconformist!” Guan Yu shot back, eyeing her flamboyant outfit.

“How dare you call me nonconformist!” She bristled like a ruffled hen, claws ready to strike.

Noticing Dongfang Mu’s permissive smile, Guan Yu raised his palm. “My hand itches… needs something to pat.”

Dongfang Huowu instinctively covered her bottom, glaring.

Dongfang Mu laughed heartily. “Guan Yu! My unruly sister becomes a meek rabbit around you. I can rest easy now!”

“Rest easy how?” Guan Yu puzzled. They barely knew each other.

Jiang Ziqi maintained neutrality but wondered: Was Guan Yu truly oblivious?

“Enough standing outside.” Dongfang Mu ushered them through vermilion gates into a courtyard that left Guan Yu gaping like a country visitor. Every beam used precious pear wood – extravagant even for ancient ministers. Marble paved the ground. This “crumbling” compound’s value dwarfed modern villas.

Guan Yu mused: When I’m rich, I’ll build such understated luxury.

“Coming, Boss Guan?” Jiang Ziqi prompted as he lingered.

Inside, Dongfang Mu presented them to his parents: “Father, Mother, this is Guan Yu I mentioned. Jiang Ziqi, General Jiang’s son.”

“Mr. and Mrs. Dongfang, greetings.” Guan Yu knew nothing beyond their parental status.

Dongfang Hai (Sea) assessed him. “Sit.”

Guan Yu complied directly.

“No manners!” Dongfang Huowu muttered.

Guan Yu nearly retorted: Your father told me to sit! Only decorum stopped him from spanking her again. His lingering gaze made her step back.

“What are you plotting?”

“What could I do?” His eyes boldly appraised her curves, forgetting their audience.

“Mama! He’s bullying me! Even Big Brother sides with him!”

Mr. Dongfang suddenly laughed. “Interesting! Muer praised you, young man. Now I see why. Promising!”

Baffled, Guan Yu followed Dongfang Mu to another room filled with antiques and calligraphy – the heir’s quarters.

“Today’s just casual tea.” Dongfang Mu poured, astonishing Jiang Ziqi. The aloof Young Master Dongfang serving guests? Unprecedented.

“Brother Dongfang, I need a favor.” Guan Yu broached. “I’m going to Taiwan soon. Could your family watch over things here?”

“Taiwan? Why? How long?”

“Unclear. Maybe days, maybe weeks. Why?”

“Nothing. Going alone?”

“Yes.”

“Then I’ve a request.” Dongfang Mu hesitated. “My sister keeps wanting to travel. Given our status, she can’t go openly. Take her to Taiwan – spare me her nagging.”

Guan Yu nearly spat his tea. “Take that hellion? No way!”

She’d make the trip unbearable. Worse, his mission involved danger – risking this precious girl? Unthinkable.

Dongfang Mu pleaded: “She’s willful but means well. Just let her sightsee – no trouble.”

Guan Yu inwardly scoffed. “Brother Dongfang, my refusal isn’t personal. This trip’s dangerous – I can’t protect her.”
