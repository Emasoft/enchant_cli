The entire force sent him flying sideways. Cao Di crashed into the stone wall and collapsed on the ground, his skull feeling near splitting. Dazed and battered, he lay like broken scaffolding before understanding what struck him.

Guanyu strode over, grabbed Cao Di by the collar, and hauled him up from the ground. Stone-hard fists pummeled Cao Di's abdomen until bloody froth spilled from his lips. Even after the man lost consciousness, Guanyu kept striking - vengeance for Jiang Xin's suffering.

"Stop! People are coming from over there!" Zou Wuhei warned from behind.

Guanyu flung Cao Di aside like discarded refuse. Drawing his Soulfall Blade, he charged into another stone chamber. Before adversaries could react, the dancing steel had already felled a dozen men within breaths through Guanyu and Zou Wuhei's coordinated assault.

Their leader lasted two exchanges before fleeing. No escape existed under Guanyu's watchful eyes. Soon the man joined his groaning subordinates on the ground.

Purposely sparing lives, Guanyu scanned the chamber. No hidden exits remained. "Who are you? How did you get in?" the leader gasped.

"Unworthy of answers," Guanyu coldly replied. "Know only that Cao Laoye sent us for your heads. Ponder the rest in hell." He deliberately framed the Cao patriarch.

Returning to Jiang Xin's side, Guanyu knelt beside her disheveled form. "Princess," he called softly, "Princess, wake. Are you hurt?"

Eyelids fluttering open, Jiang Xin's foggy gaze met his. "Wan Hong? You... came to save me?" she murmured before slipping back into unconsciousness.

Chapter 4928: Successful Rescue

Zou Wuhei freed two maids from their bonds. "No thanks needed," he said as they profusely bowed. "I act under Prince Zou's command."

Seeing Jiang Xin relapse, Guanyu noted tear tracks staining her dusty cheeks even in sleep. After severing her restraints, he lifted her slight frame. Her arms unconsciously encircled his neck as he carried her - an awkward intimacy overshadowed by urgency.

Emerging from tunnels, they found the Crown Prince waiting. "All safe?" he urgently asked.

Guanyu nodded. "Seal this place. Cao Di lies within - irrefutable evidence. Other captives are subdued under Zou Wuhei's watch. Let us escort the Princess discreetly."

Horse hooves thundered toward the capital, Guanyu cradling Jiang Xin mid-air to buffer the ride. Her cracked lips and grime-streaked face spoke of endured horrors.

At the palace gates, the yellow-robed Crown Prince cleared their path. Eunuch Yu Kong, despite advanced age, sprinted breathlessly to the imperial study. "Your Majesty! The Princess returns!"

Emperor and Grand Princess surged forward as Prince Zou smiled knowingly. "Where?" the Emperor demanded.

"Approaching now!" Yu Kong wheezed, collapsed on marble floors.

At the palace threshold, Guanyu transferred Jiang Xin to the Crown Prince. "My role ends here." His retreating figure vanished before thanks could form.

Chapter 4929: Apologies First

The Crown Prince's knees hit stone as he presented Jiang Xin before the Dragon Throne. Grand Princess wept over her daughter's torn garments and exposed underrobes. "Summon physicians!" the Emperor roared.

Reviving briefly, Jiang Xin clung to her mother. "I thought... never see you again!" Sobs shook her slight frame before exhaustion reclaimed consciousness.

Physicians diagnosed severe dehydration. As bamboo tubes trickled water between cracked lips, Jiang Xin stirred. "Mother?" Her trembling hands found the Grand Princess. Spotting the Emperor, she whispered, "Forgive this worry, Imperial Grandfather."

"Peace matters most," the Emperor murmured, stroking her hair. "Rest now."

When only the Crown Prince and Prince Zou remained, the Emperor demanded details. "Cao Di was among captives at the northern temple's underground complex," the Crown Prince reported.

Grand Princess's nails dug into her palms. "The Cao clan dares touch my flesh? Annihilate them!"

"Seal the capital!" the Emperor thundered. "Five thousand Imperial Guards to raze Cao Manor! Resistance earns death!"

Chapter 4930: Counteraccusations

As troops surrounded Cao Manor, they found the patriarch missing - last seen entering Qin Manor. In secret chambers, Qin Laoye kicked the cowering Cao Laoye. "Still deny collusion? Your son's captured!"

Cao Laoye lay motionless, accepting fate. Outside, imperial edicts echoed through streets as the Crown Prince's men stormed properties. Hundreds of Cao household maids huddled in courtyards, their masters' vices evident in disproportionate female servants.

Meanwhile, Prince Zou basked in unseen triumph. The Emperor's promised rewards shimmered before him like desert mirages. Yet in palace healing chambers, Jiang Xin's nightmares featured shadowy saviors - warm hands lifting her from serpent-filled caverns. Were they Chu Fan's? Wan Hong's? The mystery lingered as her trembling fingers clutched silk sheets, safe at last within gilded walls.
