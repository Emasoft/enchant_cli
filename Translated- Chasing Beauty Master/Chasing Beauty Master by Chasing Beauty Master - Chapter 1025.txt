The police had arrived, but upon seeing the location, they remained in their vehicle. The fat security guard, frustrated by their inaction after his prolonged shouting, approached the police car and knocked on the window. "What are you still doing here? I saw the armed man enter with my own eyes. He’s definitely inside!"

A voice from inside the car warned, "Did you offend someone? Why stir trouble at a clinic?"

The fat man bellowed, "I offend people daily! That gunman brought an injured person here. If you don’t act now, he’ll escape. What are you waiting for?"

"What’s going on here?" Yang Conghan emerged, her voice icy. Though masked, the guard recognized her instantly and bowed slightly. "Young Miss, this man claims an armed individual entered the clinic. He insists on a search, but I refused to disturb the patients."

Yang Conghan studied the guard—a robust man in his thirties, over six feet tall with rugged features. His competent handling of the situation impressed her.

"Leave this to me," she said with a nod of approval. The guard bowed again and stepped aside.

Yang Conghan noted his potential for promotion, perhaps to her grandfather’s elite garden security. Behind her, a dozen solemn-faced bodyguards in black suits filed out—a necessary precaution arranged by her grandfather for nighttime outings, given the Yang family’s numerous enemies.

The fat man craned his neck, bewildered by the sudden crowd. Suspicion flickered. "Stop! Who are you people?" he shouted, blocking Yang Conghan’s path.

Her bodyguards swiftly surrounded him. Trembling, the man stammered, "Y-you think you can silence me? This is a lawful society! Touch me, and you’ll regret it!"

He glanced triumphantly at the police car, believing the officers inside—upright officials—would intervene. Instead, they watched him with disdain, muttering about his idiocy.

Yang Conghan ignored him and addressed the car’s occupants. "I am Yang Conghan. There’s no armed man here. Leave immediately, or face consequences."

A flustered voice replied, "Apologies, Young Miss Yang! We’ll depart at once!" The car sped off, leaving the fat man gaping.

Realizing his blunder, he groveled, "I-I didn’t know this was Yang territory! Forgive my ignorance!"

"Leave. Now," Yang Conghan cut him off coldly.

The man scrambled to his car and fled, tires screeching.

She sighed, irritated by Guan Yu’s recklessness in threatening an officer. This would require damage control—tomorrow’s headlines couldn’t sensationalize "Yang Heiress Shields Gunman."

In the clinic’s moonlit courtyard, Guan Yu and Second Wolf conversed in a pavilion. "I won’t wait for Bill Lin’s next move," Guan Yu said. "They’ve studied my patterns. I must strike first."

**Chapter 2621: I Take My Work Seriously**

Second Wolf frowned. "You’re vulnerable now. Even I can’t stop a close-range assassin."

"What’s your plan?"

"After settling matters here, I’ll rally allies against the Feng family. Bill Lin’s plotting—I need to counter."

"Bill’s clan is formidable," Second Wolf remarked. "Impressive foes you’ve chosen."

Guan Yu’s eyes hardened. "I don’t fear them. They’ve made their choice."

"Avoid crowds. They’ll strike again."

"Any news on Ying Shangu?"

Second Wolf grimaced. "She’s elusive. Posed as a factory worker—slipped away when I got distracted."

Guan Yu snorted. "Distracted by female workers, no doubt."

Second Wolf scratched his head sheepishly. "There were hundreds! By the time I noticed her spider gone…"

"Now she’s vanished. Great."

"I’ll find her," Second Wolf vowed.

"Focus on Bill Lin first. The auction’s upcoming—another 'treasure map' fragment’s up. Chaos brews in A City."

"Think Ying Shangu will show?"

"Depends if she’s healed. She’s cunning—might risk it."

**Chapter 2622: The Long Night**

Guan Yu added, "Watch for her spies before the auction. Don’t let her escape again."

"Worry about yourself. Bill Lin’s fixated on you."

Guan Yu nodded. "I’ve alerted Jones to investigate. Something’s off—Bill’s moving too fast."

"Rest. You’ll need it." Second Wolf gestured to the lit windows above.

Inside, Guan Yu found Xue Jing exhausted beside Shuangshuang’s bed. A nurse stood watch.

"Rest," he urged Xue Jing. "I’ll stay."

She agreed wearily. In the adjacent room, she fell asleep instantly. Guan Yu sat awake, thoughts churning.

Meanwhile, Bill Lin’s group reviewed footage of Xue Jing’s icy power surge.

"Incredible!" Bill gasped. "Such cultivation exists?"

Ge Yinglai sneered. "The world holds many wonders. Surprised?"

Bill turned to his aide. "Have you seen anything like this?"

The aide shook his head. Onscreen, chaos reigned—a harbinger of storms to come.
