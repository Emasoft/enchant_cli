Chapter 1261: Another Opponent Encountered

“Miss Amy, what brings you here?” A short but clever-looking man rushed to greet her upon spotting Amy.

Amy seemed unimpressed by his enthusiasm, casually replying, “Why shouldn’t I come? Is there any place in the Spirit Forest forbidden to me?”

Guan Yu chuckled helplessly. The little girl remained as unreasonable as ever. Moments ago, she had repeatedly advised him to interact cautiously and politely, yet now she’d forgotten her own words entirely.

The man appeared unfazed, as if long accustomed to Amy’s manner. But when his gaze fell on Guan Yu, his demeanor shifted completely. He scrutinized Guan Yu before coolly asking, “And who is this?”

Guan Yu quickly responded, “Oh, I’m Miss Amy’s friend. My name is Guan Yu—”

Before he could finish, the man waved dismissively. “No need to answer. I merely asked casually. Your name and identity hold no interest to me.”

Rebuffed, Guan Yu suppressed his irritation. Had he not come with a learning mindset, he might have slapped the man outright.

Forcing a smile, Guan Yu remarked, “Oh? It seems you’re quite interested in Miss Amy. Pity she shows no such interest in you.”

The barb struck deep. The man—Bowen—hadn’t expected this seemingly meek outsider to challenge him immediately. Guan Yu spoke truth: Bowen did fancy Amy, but among her many admirers, he ranked lowest.

The most dazzling contender remained Locke—the century’s rare genius of the Spirit Clan. Young yet already a Magister, appointed as guard captain by the clan leader, his authority surpassed even the Simings. Many saw him as future chieftain, and all knew of his lifelong pursuit of Amy. Faced with such competition—handsome, high-status, wealthy—others naturally withdrew.

Stung, Bowen leaned close to Guan Yu, whispering threateningly, “Listen, punk. Never speak like that again. And stay away from Amy. If you don’t, even if I don’t deal with you, others certainly will.”

Guan Yu sighed dramatically. “Truthfully, I wanted to help you. But alas… I can’t comply with your demands. What’s to be done?”

Bowen’s killing intent flared. As Spirit Forest elite, how could he tolerate this outsider’s blatant provocation?

“Can’t comply? Then let me teach you!”

A deep-blue ice blade materialized in Bowen’s hand, blue halos shimmering above his head.

“Marvelous! So this is how high-tier spells manifest!” Guan Yu marveled.

Bowen sneered, “Country bumpkin! Now witness how high-tier spells aren’t just pretty—they’re deadly!”

The ice blade slashed horizontally, but as it neared Guan Yu’s body, a crimson light clanged against it, sending the weapon clattering.

Guan Yu, who’d prepared to dodge, blinked in surprise. Who here would aid him?

Bowen seethed. From Guan Yu’s movements, he’d gauged the man’s magical prowess—a mere Senior Mage, easily crushable. Yet interference arose at this critical juncture!

“Heh, Brother Bowen, no need for alarm. That red light came from me.”

Both turned toward the booming voice. Guan Yu saw an approaching figure with enormous eyes dominating a tiny face—as if his head consisted solely of ocular organs.

“Big Eyes! Why interfere?” Bowen snapped. “Can’t you see I’m disciplining someone?”

The large-eyed man laughed heartily. “Indeed I saw. But this man’s my friend. Indulge me this face, won’t you?”

He glanced conspiratorially at Guan Yu, who swore this was their first meeting.

“Your friend?” Bowen mocked. “They say your eyes are big—I say you’re blind! Since when’s he your associate?”

Unfazed, Big Eyes countered, “True, we’ve never met. But as friend to our Spirit Clan, does he not count as my friend?”

“Sophistry! Today, regardless of affiliations, he’s no friend of mine. I’ll battle him now—a welcoming gift from his host!”

Another ice blade—white this time—materialized. Though basic Earth-tier spell, its classification alone awed most. Across Blue Beauty Continent, only 1% of mages could wield Earth-tier magic.

As the enhanced blade shot toward Guan Yu, purple light intercepted. Recognizing the hue, Guan Yu whirled around—but found emptiness.

“Who dares interfere?” Bowen roared. “Show yourself! Or are you too hideous?”

His laughter died abruptly, jaw slackening. “Y-Younger Siming! Greetings, Honored Younger Siming!”

Guan Yu’s pulse quickened. Younger Siming? That beautiful violet-clad girl? Why was she here?

Approaching, the violet-robed girl ignored Guan Yu, addressing Bowen’s strained smile. “Repeat your last words. I didn’t quite hear.”

Her youthful voice sounded adorably stern. Guan Yu mused, “Will this little beauty overpower Bowen?”

But Bowen already trembled—not from fear of her power, but her position. Though both were Archmages, the Simings served as clan adjudicators, enforcing punishments for rule-breakers.

Younger Siming smiled disarmingly. “Do you know the penalty for publicly insulting clan elders?”

Bowen nodded numbly. Her beauty masked thorns.

Satisfied by his compliance, she turned to Guan Yu. “Master Guan, what brings you here? Seeking to spar with our mages?”

“Merely learning, Honored Siming.”

Bowen interjected, “Let’s duel! Now’s perfect timing!”

“Do you truly crave punishment?” Younger Siming’s gaze sharpened.

Guan Yu waved placatingly. He recognized Bowen’s contempt—the man saw him as trash, seeking to humiliate him publicly. Yet Guan Yu welcomed this. To grow swiftly, he needed ruthless opponents.

“Agreed! But let’s wager something.”

“Done!” Bowen leapt at the chance, eyes gleaming maliciously.

“The loser calls the winner ‘Grandfather’.”

Laughter erupted, easing tension. Bowen flushed—he’d anticipated serious stakes, not this farce.

Younger Siming, resigned, warned, “Spar only. No fatalities. Violators face clan justice.”

Though addressing both, the unspoken target was Bowen—clan rules couldn’t punish outsiders.

Bowen cared not. Ice blade blazing, he initiated combat stance. Younger Siming studied Guan Yu’s resolute eyes, wondering: What secrets empower this apparent Senior Mage to challenge elite?

As they engaged, Bowen summoned deep-blue ice blades—color indicating immense magic. Though considering Guan Yu weak, he employed strongest techniques, determined to crush him instantly.

“Earth-tier spell: Frostblade!” Younger Siming identified. A genuine Earth-tier technique, powerful yet controllable.

Guan Yu’s eyes sparkled excitedly. Perfect! Rapid advancement required exposure to higher-tier spells—Yellow, Mystic, now Earth!

Lacking countermeasures, he improvised. Against Bandit previously, he’d repurposed opponents’ techniques. Now, he’d enhance Mystic-tier Gale Slash!

“What if I augment it with elemental fusion?”

Decision made, Guan Yu’s hands transformed into blades, elements swirling violently—a spectacle astonishing even seasoned mages.

Bowen’s confidence wavered. Though Guan Yu used basic Mystic-tier spell, his elemental control surpassed expectations—a mage’s core competency determining their ceiling.

“What’s happening? How’s he doing this?”

“Is that…Gale Slash? Madness! Using Mystic-tier against Earth-tier?”

Amidst exclamations, Younger Siming reassessed Guan Yu: “This man’s monstrous!”

“Control means nothing!” Bowen roared. “Die!”

The blades collided—explosive light blinding all. When vision cleared, both combatants lay fallen.

“Dragon Brother! Are you hurt?” Amy rushed to Guan Yu’s side, frantically checking him.

Younger Siming approached, surprised by the mutual knockout. Neither had held back.

“Dragon Brother! Wake up!” Amy wept, shaking him.

Guan Yu’s eyes fluttered open. “Silly girl…I’m not dead yet.”

Relieved, Younger Siming asked, “Master Guan, are you well?”

Gasping, Guan Yu nodded. “Just…exhausted. But he’s…finished.”

Chapter 1262: Spell Enhancement

Bowen’s grin froze grotesquely as purple light dissipated, revealing the violet-clad adjudicator.

Guan Yu craned his neck, confirming—yes, the same beautiful Younger Siming. Why her intervention?

She materialized before them, ignoring Guan Yu to address Bowen’s forced smile. “Your words earlier—enlighten me.”

Her girlish voice contrasted with authoritative presence. Guan Yu marveled at her poise.

Bowen trembled uncontrollably—not from her power, but her judicial role. The Simings determined punishments for clan transgressors, their word law.

“Publicly insulting elders warrants what penalty?” Her smile chilled him.

Bowen gulped. Everyone knew—public humiliation demanded public flogging.

Sensing his fear, Younger Siming turned to Guan Yu. “Master Guan visits us for magical exchange?”

“Learning only, Honored Siming.”

“Then let’s duel!” Bowen interjected desperately. “No better time!”

Younger Siming’s glare silenced him. “Craving the lash?”

Guan Yu intervened. He recognized Bowen’s contempt but needed such vicious opponents to temper himself.

“Accepted! But let’s raise stakes.”

Eagerly, Bowen agreed, envisioning Guan Yu’s humiliation.

“Loser addresses winner as ‘Grandfather’.”

Laughter erupted, easing tension. Bowen flushed—he’d anticipated gold or artifacts, not this jest.

Younger Siming issued final warnings about restraint before allowing combat.

As they assumed stances, she pondered Guan Yu’s audacity. What hidden depths enabled this apparent underdog to challenge elites?

Bowen conjured frost blades crackling with Earth-tier energy. Guan Yu countered with swirling elemental Gale Slash—a Mystic-tier spell enhanced through improvisation.

The collision illuminated the forest, both fighters collapsing from backlash.

Amy’s tearful ministrations roused Guan Yu, who weakly assured his safety. Younger Siming noted his drained state but intact spirit—and Bowen’s utter defeat.

Chapter 1263: Grandfather’s Call

Elements spiraled wildly around Guan Yu’s palms, astonishing spectators. Even seasoned mages gaped—none had witnessed such chaotic yet controlled elemental gathering.

Bowen’s confidence wavered. Though Guan Yu employed basic Mystic-tier spell, his elemental mastery surpassed expectations—critical for magical ascension.

“Madness! Using Gale Slash against Earth-tier?”

Younger Siming’s eyes widened. “Monstrous talent!”

Bowen’s frost blade struck—met by Guan Yu’s enhanced slash. Detonation blinded all, leaving both combatants prone.

Amy’s sobs roused Guan Yu, who teased her dramatics. Younger Siming confirmed his survival through sheer willpower.

“He’s…completely spent,” Guan Yu gasped, pointing at the motionless Bowen. “But I…endured.”

The crowd erupted—an outsider defeating clan elite with enhanced Mystic-tier against Earth-tier! Younger Siming’s gaze lingered on Guan Yu, sensing epochal potential.
