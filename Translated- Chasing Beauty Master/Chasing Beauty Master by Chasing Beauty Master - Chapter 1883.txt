Moreover, there was another matter the Princess hadn't mentioned. Jiang Xin's heart now clearly held Wan Hong, yet the Princess absolutely forbade their union. Though aware of the man's capabilities, she found him utterly lacking in reliability.

"I didn't deliberately assist the Crown Prince," the Princess stated. "I merely suggested Father grant him merits for saving Xin'er. That's all."

Jiang Yuan-kai remained silent. The Princess' prejudice against Wan Hong rendered further discussion futile. If she insisted on crediting the Crown Prince, so be it. The matter held little consequence for him anyway.

Fortunately, Wan Hong wasn't ambitious for glory. Otherwise, Jiang Yuan-kai mused, helping such grand efforts without recompense would breed resentment. He resolved to invite Wan Hong for a gratitude dinner when opportunity permitted.

Yet the Princess' refusal to return home troubled Jiang Yuan-kai most. Palace regulations suffocated him – he couldn't bear remaining another day in this gilded cage.

"Princess," he ventured, "since the Cao family's crimes are proven – Cao Di caught red-handed, assassins confessing to Lord Cao's hiring – why does His Majesty delay judgment? The public awaits their confiscation. What holds the Emperor's hand?"

"You inquire about matters beyond my knowledge," the Princess sighed. "Father's thoughts remain opaque. Whether swift or slow, his decisions reign supreme. Xin'er's safety matters most – other affairs hold no interest."

Jiang Yuan-kai suppressed frustration at her feminine perspective. "If you wish to credit the Crown Prince with rescue merits, why not have him oversee Cao's confiscation? That fat appointment would truly benefit him."

"You're right," the Princess considered. "That lucrative task mustn't fall to minor officials. I'll petition Father – only the Crown Prince deserves this."

Unknown to her, Jiang Yuan-kai came under Guan Yu's urging. With Prince Zou departed, the Crown Prince faced mounting obstacles in the capital.

Honoring his promise to the Prince, Guan Yu had approached Jiang Yuan-kai. Though reluctant, Jiang saw this as repaying favors. The Princess' influence made her the ideal advocate.

Now convinced confiscation should benefit the Crown Prince, the matter seemed settled. The Princess would protest any other appointee, ensuring success through her advocacy.

Chapter 4949: The Return

Having resolved Guan Yu's request, Jiang Yuan-kai shelved the Princess' homecoming. Her strong temperament demanded careful handling – forceful measures would backfire.

At the inn, Guan Yu observed Chu Fan's improving leg injury. Though still requiring crutches, the foot now touched ground – promising progress.

Earlier, Guan Yu had suggested spiritual healing for faster recovery. Chu Fan refused, fearing side effects, insisting on gradual recuperation.

"How fares Jiang Xin?" Chu Fan's first question upon arrival.

"Painful inquiry," Guan Yu replied. "Confined in the palace with the Princess, her news remains sealed. You ask in vain."

"True," Chu Fan conceded. "Yet anxiety gnaws. I must see her to ease this worry."

Though understanding, Guan Yu could hardly infiltrate the palace. Their conversation shifted as Chu Fan mentioned morning commotion at the Consort's residence – martial artists demanding Jiang Yuan-kai, dispersed by Capital Guards yet vowing return.

"Jiang's in the palace," Guan Yu chuckled. "Let them storm imperial gates if daring. The Eastern Sea Treasure won't be easily claimed."

After the crowd's dispersal, Guan Yu inquired about Capital Guards' role. Chu Fan explained their civil maintenance duties, though Guan Yu noted their absence during his street battle with the Qin family.

The truth was simpler – the Guards avoided noble conflicts. When Qin disowned their dead after the skirmish, the Guards disposed of the corpses as nameless vagrants.

Chu Fan's true purpose emerged – seeking Jiang Xin. Knowing Guan Yu's capabilities yet refusal to help, he resigned himself to her safety. His focus turned to constructing the Rouge Theater.

After Chu Fan left, Guan Yu resolved to counsel Jiang Yuan-kai. The Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl he'd provided caused unexpected troubles. Surrendering it to the Emperor might avert danger, though the treasure's allure overshadowed security concerns.

As Guan Yu pondered, a Consort Residence guard arrived with dinner invitation. Preparing to depart, he faced Wang Xiao-rong and Qiqi's insistence to accompany him – previous refusals having bred resentment.

Chapter 4950: Disinterest

"This concerns important discussions," Guan Yu protested. "Jiang Xin's absent – what warrants your attendance?"

"We languish in this inn!" Qiqi complained. "Feasts at the Consort's must surpass even Royal Kitchen delicacies!"

"Wanyang Tavern's chefs surpass imperial cooks," Guan Yu countered. "Order whatever you desire there."

"Different chefs, different flavors!" Qiqi stamped. "We will go!"

The standoff broke with the arrival of the Demon Soul Sect's Left Envoy. After greetings, he demanded information about the Dragon Pearl on the Sect Leader's orders.

"Your tone commands subordinates," Guan Yu coldly noted. "I belong neither to you nor your Sect."

Wang Xiao-rong intervened: "The Pearl lies with Jiang Yuan-kai. Why harass Guan Yu?"

"Father's orders," the Envoy replied. "The vanished treasure's reappearance demands investigation."

Guan Yu shrugged. "Before gifting it, I knew not what it was. My knowledge begins and ends there."

"Preposterous!" The Envoy glared. "How obtain what you claim ignorance of?"

Chapter 4951: Fortune After Calamity

Tension thickened until Wang Xiao-rong redirected: "Father needs no mythical treasure. Our coffers overflow."

"Master's decree stands," the Envoy insisted. To Guan Yu: "The Sect Leader will have answers."

Guan Yu's smile held steel. "Threats? Remember who retrieved your Master from death's door. This 'savior' now faces interrogation?"

The Envoy paled, remembering Guan Yu's role in the Sect Leader's survival. Before he could respond, Guan Yu continued: "Return empty-handed. My answer remains."

As the Envoy departed stiffly, Wang Xiao-rong sighed in relief. Qiqi broke the silence: "Now about that feast..."
