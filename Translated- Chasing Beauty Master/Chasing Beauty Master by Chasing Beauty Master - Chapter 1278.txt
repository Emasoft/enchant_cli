“But anything is possible, and I’ve always been extraordinarily lucky, hehehe.” Guanyu smiled while scanning the noticeboard. Though he hadn’t yet found his name, his mind was already fervently praying.

Guanyu thought: *I’d rather face anyone from the Yunqing Sect than Xiaotong. Against others, I can fight with all my strength. But if it’s Xiaotong… I still owe her a favor from that time in Juhe Peak’s latrine. If she becomes my opponent and mentions that debt, I’d have no choice but to surrender.*

Just then, Xiaotong patted Guanyu’s shoulder and laughed, “See, Guanyu? I told you—we’re destined to face each other tomorrow!”

Startled, Guanyu followed the line of Xiaotong’s slender finger. His eyes widened as he saw his name listed third in the top row, with “Xiaotong” glaring beside it as his opponent.

“Impossible! How absurd! Now I’m dying to know who arranged these matchups,” Guanyu muttered to himself.

Xiaotong grinned. “So, Guanyu, please go easy on me tomorrow. You wouldn’t strike too harshly, would you?” The question left Guanyu tongue-tied, forcing him to respond with a strained smile.

“Hehe, truthfully, I came earlier and nearly despaired when I saw you were my opponent. I knew I stood no chance. I was about to leave when I spotted you arriving.”

Though Xiaotong spoke cheerfully, her carefree demeanor only deepened Guanyu’s unease. “So you already knew? What a coincidence! I never imagined facing you...”

“Neither did I!” Xiaotong sighed. “I thought Siqi would make the top four, and I’d at least reach the quarterfinals. But now it seems I’ll fall tomorrow. Against you, I’ve no confidence at all.”

Guanyu scratched his head sheepishly. “I’m just a novice junior brother who’s barely grasped the basics. You’ve trained for years, Senior Sister Xiaotong. If anyone’s outmatched here, it’s me. You’re too humble.”

“Oh?” Xiaotong tilted her head, eyes glinting mischievously. “You’re sweet to flatter me. Forget your spells—that magical artifact of yours alone could defeat me.”

Guanyu fell silent, dismayed by the impending duel. He prided himself on never owing debts, yet here he was, indebted to Xiaotong. Had she not aided him that night in Juhe Peak’s latrine, he’d have become the laughingstock of the female disciples.

“Senior Sister Xiaotong,” he said solemnly, “if you wish to win, simply demand I forfeit. I’ll concede without resistance—I owe you that much.”

“Dream on!” Xiaotong giggled. “I know about the debt, but I won’t waste it here. Even if you let me win, I’d never reach the top four. That favor’s too precious to squander.”

Puzzled, Guanyu asked, “Don’t you desire victory?”

“Are you so certain of defeating me?” Xiaotong arched an eyebrow, her smile turning enigmatic. “I was merely being polite earlier. Did you truly believe you could overpower me? Let me remind you—I’m my master’s star disciple!”

Guanyu’s lips twitched. She’d been toying with him all along, unafraid despite his offer to repay the debt. The realization left him flustered.

“Heh… It seems I overthought matters,” Guanyu conceded. “Very well—we’ll settle this tomorrow.”

Suddenly, Xiaotong adopted a pitiful expression, gazing up at him with doe-like eyes. “Guanyu… Must we truly fight? If you insist on winning, I’ll yield. I don’t wish to clash with you… What if you hurt me?”

Guanyu nearly groaned aloud. Xiaotong shifted moods like quicksilver—he couldn’t discern her truths from her jests. Women’s hearts were fathomless as ocean depths, their thoughts inscrutable. One misspoken word might wound her delicate sensibilities.

Exasperated, Guanyu spread his hands. “What would you have me do, Senior Sister? Should I forfeit without repaying the debt? Is that your design?”

“Hehe! Clever boy!” Xiaotong’s demeanor brightened instantly. “But you can’t make it obvious. Others might suspect collusion! Besides…” She leaned closer, conspiratorial. “I’m saving that favor for a true crisis. Wouldn’t want to waste it on mere tournament glory.”

“You place me in an impossible position!” Guanyu protested. “Master Xuánmíng expects great things from me. How can I throw the match?”

“My master expects the same of me!” Xiaotong retorted. “You already possess splendid artifacts—what need have you for more? I only want a decent magical tool from the top four prizes. Is that too much to ask?”

Guanyu hesitated. His determination to advance stemmed not just from Xuánmíng’s orders, but the legendary Merít Cauldron’s empowerment—a transformative boon for newcomers like himself. Xiaotong, however, coveted the artifacts, indifferent to the Cauldron’s secrets.

“Forgive me, Senior Sister. My reasons are… personal. I cannot yield.”

Xiaotong pouted. “So my only path to victory is cashing in that favor? Otherwise, I’ve no chance?”

“Perhaps if we duel fairly, you might still prevail,” Guanyu offered weakly.

“Nonsense! Everyone knows about your Emperor’s Seal. Challenging you’s sheer folly!” Xiaotong huffed. “Since you refuse courtesy, we’ll settle this properly tomorrow. Farewell!”

As she stormed off, Guanyu sighed. He understood her envy—after gifting Sīqí a high-grade artifact, Xiaotong naturally desired one. Yet his remaining treasures, like the Blazing Heaven Furnace, weren’t to be lightly bestowed. Perhaps if he reached the semifinals, Xuánmíng might grant another artifact he could pass to her… but such hopes were premature.

*Strange,* he mused. *She values that trivial favor more than a magical tool. What future use does she envision?*

Scanning other matchups, Guanyu noted Āzé would face Wáng Jūn of Bamboo Forest Peak, while Xiǎo Zhì dueled Mǎ Xiāo from Front Return Peak. Both matches occurred morning, leaving Guanyu’s afternoon bout free to support his friends.

At dawn, Guanyu set out for Xuánzhōng Peak.

“Where to?” Second-to-Wolf materialized beside him.

“Cheering for Xiǎo Zhì and Āzé. Join me?”

Nodding, the wolf-man fell into step. They found Āzé awaiting them at the training grounds.

“Guanyu! Knew you’d come!” Āzé beamed.

“Naturally. My match isn’t till afternoon.” Guanyu turned as Xiǎo Zhì strode over, chest puffed proudly.

“Who’ll you root for?” Xiǎo Zhì challenged. “My clash with Mǎ Xiāo promises spectacle—clashing steel and roaring spells! Āzé’s fights? Just tedious energy drains.”

Āzé rolled his eyes. “My opponent’s Wáng Jūn—Bamboo Forest’s ace! His reputation precedes him.”

Xiǎo Zhì smirked. “Ah yes, the ‘Jade Prince’ with skin fairer than jade! Half the sect mistakes him for a maiden. Even the men stare!”

Guanyu’s ears perked. *Wáng Jūn… Could it be her?* Memories surfaced—a tomboyish classmate from Kaihuáng Academy who’d pursued Xuē Jìng relentlessly before vanishing after rejection. If this was the same person masquerading as male within the sect…

“I’ll watch Āzé’s match,” Guanyu decided. “Your confidence needs no bolstering, Xiǎo Zhì.”

As Xiǎo Zhì departed for Front Return Peak, the arena master announced: “Xuánzhōng Peak’s Āzé versus Bamboo Forest Peak’s Wáng Jūn! Combatants, prepare!”

Guanyu pressed forward, eager to confirm the mysterious opponent’s identity. The Bamboo Forest contingent arrived in force—their discipline-focused sect’s honor rested on Wáng Jūn’s shoulders. Yet Guanyu’s curiosity burned brighter: *How does a woman pass undetected in the male-dominated Bamboo Forest Peak?*

The crowd’s murmur swelled as two figures ascended the platform. Āzé bowed to his opponent—a lithe figure with porcelain features and eyes sharp as daggers. Recognition struck Guanyu like lightning.

*It’s her.*
