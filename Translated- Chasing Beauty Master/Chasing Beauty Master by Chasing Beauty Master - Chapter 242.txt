Yang Long recalled Zhou Jin’s final instructions before departing: spare no effort, exhaust all resources, and ensure Guan Yu’s elimination. As for Niu Le, an insignificant figure, Yang Long saw no need to waste manpower. Even if the man escaped to call for reinforcements, what of it? By then, Guan Yu would already be dead.

The subordinate beside him caught his meaning. With a wave to the dozens behind, he commanded, “After them.”

Thus, dozens of men armed with submachine guns charged into the undergrowth.

Yang Long glanced at the ink-black night, brow furrowed. He pulled out his phone and dialed Zhou Jin, demanding additional forces for a carpet search to trap Guan Yu within.

**Chapter 606: Night Battle (Part 2)**

“Here, brother, have a smoke. Freezing our asses out here—this’ll warm you up.” One of the twenty-five search teams consisted of men from Zhou Jin’s faction and Ma De’s side.

“Thanks, mate.” The other man accepted the offered cigarette, lit it, and exhaled a plume of smoke. His tone carried resentment. “Damn right. Weather like this, we ought to be warming some woman’s bed. If the boss hadn’t ordered it, who’d volunteer to freeze?”

The man who’d offered the cigarette lit his own. “All this fuss to catch one guy? And in pitch dark? Like finding a needle in the ocean. What the hell are the bosses thinking?”

“Eh, who knows? We grunts just follow orders. Take a couple puffs and ditch it. Don’t want the glow giving us away.” After two quick drags, the man crushed the cigarette under his heel.

“Hah! Scared, are we? That bastard should be praying we *don’t* find him. You think he’d dare come for *us*?” The other sneered.

Before he could inhale again, his smoking hand froze mid-air. His eyes bulged, terror-stricken. He struggled to speak, to move—but strength failed him.

“In our line, caution keeps you alive. Brother, what’s wr—” The words died as the man opposite collapsed. A shadow loomed before him. Instinctively, he raised his submachine gun—but overestimated his reflexes. Darkness swallowed him as he slumped, lifeless.

Neither had seen their killer’s face. Neither understood why the trained hounds hadn’t barked a warning. They departed with regret and unanswered questions.

Guan Yu gazed coldly at the two corpses, expression unflinching. A faint smirk curled his lips. “Zhou Jin really went all out—fifty men. Damn it, I’ll remember this debt. And that fatso—I’ll deal with him too.”

Suddenly, the two German Shepherds that had obeyed the dead men trotted to Guan Yu’s legs, nuzzling his calves with whimpers of submission.

Crouching, Guan Yu stroked their heads tenderly, his smile enigmatic.

Zhou Jin had erred gravely by bringing the hounds. This oversight doomed the operation. Even in death, Zhou Jin would never grasp why.

Had the departed souls witnessed this scene, their ghosts might’ve raged.

This pair had been Guan Yu’s first targets. From a kilometer away, he’d tracked their every move. The sight of the dogs thrilled him—they were delivering him a canine army. With fifty hounds, exterminating the hunters would be child’s play.

With a mental command, the two dogs followed Guan Yu into the shadows.

Identical scenes unfolded across the dark terrain. Guan Yu seized control of each pair’s hounds, approached soundlessly, then swiftly ended their lives with thunderous force.

By the time Guan Yu eliminated the fifteenth team, his presence was detected. A nearby group noticed vanishing lights and a fleeing shadow. They fired warning shots but didn’t pursue—anyone who could kill so silently was beyond their skill.

---

“Boss, we’ve lost fifteen teams.” After the gunfire, Yang Long sensed disaster. His subordinate radioed others—only nine groups responded. Fifteen had gone silent, likely dead.

“Fifteen?!” Yang Long’s voice cracked over the radio.

Eliminating fifteen teams undetected? Each had a trained hound! Yang Long knew these dogs’ prowess—he’d trained some himself. Yet Guan Yu had bypassed their alerts.

Yang Long admitted he couldn’t have done this. Not him, nor the world’s elite killers or commandos.

How? The more Yang Long pondered, the more terrifying Guan Yu seemed. Dread took root in his heart.

“Boss… what now?” The radio voice trembled.

Yang Long inhaled sharply. “Gather the remaining ten teams. Move as one. Surround Guan Yu on sight—shoot to kill. No more solo operations.”

After the order, he hesitated, then advanced into the night.

However fearsome Guan Yu was, Yang Long had to face him—or live with regret.

---

“Getting smarter? Group tactics?” Guan Yu smirked, listening to the intercepted radio command. “Good. Saves me hunting them down.”

Numbers meant nothing now. His canine corps kept growing—thirty hounds circled him, loyal guardians. Soon, fifty would face Yang Long’s twenty. The math favored Guan Yu.

**Chapter 607: Canine Corps**

While Yang Long marshaled his forces, Guan Yu strategized.

To maximize his hounds, he positioned each like pieces on a chessboard—an ambush to crush Yang Long’s group.

After deploying thirty dogs, he felt drained. Controlling snakes or insects by the hundreds was easier—higher intelligence demanded more effort. At this rate, he couldn’t command the remaining twenty. He instructed his hounds to recruit the rest through… canine charm.

“Success depends on your allure,” Guan Yu told the dogs. “Off to your posts.”

The pack barked in unison and dispersed.

“Feeling like a dog myself,” Guan Yu muttered, stretching. “Time to bait the trap.”

Submachine gun in hand, he sprinted toward Yang Long’s position.

---

“Boss! Dog barks ahead—could be Guan Yu!” A subordinate aimed his flashlight.

Yang Long studied the direction. “Investigate.”

He trusted the hounds’ instincts—such commotion likely meant Guan Yu. Yet unease lingered. The young man’s prior feats haunted him.

Shaking his head, Yang Long focused. His men crept forward, guns clenched, alert for ambush.

Sudden gunfire shattered the night—and their formation.

“Down! Get down!” Yang Long roared, hitting the dirt. He returned fire blindly, but Guan Yu’s shots came from shifting directions. Bullets found targets in the dark.

To Yang Long’s horror, Guan Yu moved like a ghost—untouchable, unerring. Every time Yang Long tried to rise, suppressing fire pinned him. Helpless, he watched comrades fall.

Five minutes later, silence. Yang Long waited, then peered up—a shadow retreated into darkness.

“Bastard’s out of ammo! After him! Avenge our brothers!” Yang Long bellowed. Rage burned—he’d been outplayed at every turn.

Twenty became ten as the survivors charged, firing wildly. But Guan Yu, aided by his gravity system, had vanished. Their bullets found only air.

Maddened, the men plunged deeper—into the jaws of Guan Yu’s trap.

Fifty hounds encircled them, eyes glinting, fangs bared. The pack advanced with low growls.

“Boss… why are *our dogs* attacking us?!” A subordinate backpedaled.

Yang Long’s face darkened. Guan Yu’s work, clearly—but how? Taming so many so quickly? It took Yang Long a year to train three.

Guan Yu grew more unfathomable by the minute.

**Chapter 608: Total Annihilation**

When Yang Long first heard Guan Yu’s name, he’d dismissed him as a green youth. Even Zhou Jin’s warnings hadn’t swayed him.

Now, face-to-face with Guan Yu’s cunning and power, Yang Long tasted bitter regret. This young man rivaled veterans decades his senior. Given time, his ascent would be unstoppable.

A chill ran through Yang Long. *He must die here.*

But fifty hounds blocked their path.

“Shoot the dogs!” Yang Long barked. “Unless you want to die!”

Gunfire erupted. Hounds fell—but five remained for every human. The pack attacked ferociously, dragging men down in a frenzy of fangs.

Guan Yu watched the carnage, satisfied. He’d orchestrated this—letting Yang Long attack first to turn all hounds against him.

Like a macabre war film, the battle raged—a brutal exchange of bullets and teeth.

Yang Long’s group dwindled. For every dog killed, a man fell.

When silence finally fell, Guan Yu emerged. His canine corps—bloodied but victorious—stood guard.

Yang Long’s forces were no more.
