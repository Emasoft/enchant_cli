Chapter 4765: Mountain of Gold

The efficacy of black gemstones lay in their ability to refine top-tier magic artifacts. Among all the black gemstone-crafted artifacts Guan Yu had encountered, only his Soulfall Blade stood out.

This particular black gemstone naturally caught Guan Yu’s attention. He hadn’t expected this auction house to possess such treasures. If the price proved reasonable, he resolved to secure it.

Yet he had to weigh his finances carefully. Though wealthy, Guan Yu still needed funds to purchase the Vermilion Pavilion—an expenditure requiring astronomical sums.

Earlier, a market administrator had informed him the estate would cost around fifty thousand taels, a figure beyond most people’s means. Converted to modern Chinese currency, twenty thousand taels of silver roughly equaled over fifteen million—a staggering price indeed.

Though mountains of gold and jewels lay within Swordless Villa, Guan Yu couldn’t access them now. His immediate plan was to establish roots here, contact Du Teng for assistance with Xiao Mei, and secure external support.

“This is a rare treasure indeed—a fist-sized black luminous pearl! Even the imperial crown lacks such a magnificent gem. Such rarity cannot be found even in the palace!” The auctioneer’s hyperbolic pitch suggested ignorance of its true value as prime material for crafting magic artifacts, at least within martial circles.

Promoting it merely as a “black luminous pearl,” the auctioneer emphasized its exoticism, touting it as a peerless rarity. “This extraordinary treasure, exclusive to our Classical Auction House, starts at five thousand taels of silver! Each bid increases by five hundred taels. Begin!”

Guan Yu was startled by the low starting price. For cultivators, such a gemstone was invaluable. Acquiring it cheaply could yield massive profits through resale to experts like Xuán Míng (Mysterious Brightness).

Yet bids swiftly surpassed ten thousand taels. Evidently, some present recognized its true worth.

“Twelve thousand taels!” A melodious voice rang out—Miss Jiang, a young noblewoman, had entered the fray. Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Guan Yu sighed; hopes of a bargain were dashed.

The bid had been ten thousand five hundred, but Miss Jiang’s leap demonstrated her determination. To cultivators, this gemstone was priceless. Guan Yu decided to wait before making his decisive move.

Most bidders likely valued the stone for its beauty and rarity rather than its mystical applications. Miss Jiang herself seemed drawn by its novelty.

“Add five hundred taels,” intoned a cloaked figure at the periphery. Guan Yu observed the bidder—face obscured by a hooded black mantle, exuding calm.

The auctioneer beamed. “The gentleman raises to twelve thousand five hundred! At this modest price, can anyone resist such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?”

Merchants hesitated, fearing overinvestment. As the auctioneer’s praises continued, Guan Yu prepared to bid.

“Fifteen thousand!” Miss Jiang declared, drawing gasps. The cloaked bidder, likely a cultivator aware of the gem’s true purpose, persisted. Guan Yu noted Chu Fan’s puzzling inactivity—apparently present merely as Miss Jiang’s companion.

Though only fist-sized, this black gemstone surpassed even Guan Yu’s ruby in value. For cultivators, it represented unparalleled spiritual storage—second only to immortal-forged artifacts. Even Xuán Míng would covet such a prize.

Miss Jiang’s latest bid sparked whispers. “This black luminous stone shall be mine! State your final offers if you dare challenge me!” she proclaimed, rising defiantly.

Most attendees withdrew, unwilling to provoke her or inflate prices further. Yet the cloaked figure remained undeterred.

“Sixteen thousand,” he countered. The crowd stared incredulously—defying Miss Jiang was unheard of in the capital.

She turned, pouting. “You insufferable man! Twenty thousand!”

The hall erupted. Guan Yu massaged his temples—this reckless bidding endangered his plans. While the cloaked bidder likely sought the gemstone’s power, Miss Jiang treated it as a frivolous trophy.

Chu Fan gently tugged her sleeve. “Is this truly worth such extravagance? Your family already possesses countless jewels.”

“Chu Fan, this rarity shall be my gift to the Emperor!” Miss Jiang retorted unabashedly. Gasps followed—her closeness to the throne was legendary.

Guan Yu now understood her status. “Twenty-one thousand,” the cloaked man persisted.

“Must you devour this stone? Competing with me financially? Foolish!” Miss Jiang snapped.

The auctioneer gloated. “Twenty-one thousand! Does the honorable Miss Jiang concede?”

“Twenty-two thousand!” she shot back.

Chapter 4766: Persuasion

The duel escalated. “Twenty-three thousand,” the cloaked man stated.

“Enough increments!” Miss Jiang demanded. “State your maximum!”

Silence.

“Twenty-five thousand,” he finally offered.

“Twenty-seven!” she countered. “This shall adorn His Majesty’s crown!”

The cloaked man stiffened. “I yield. It’s yours.”

Chapter 4767: Beyond Means

Guan Yu exhaled—the showdown concluded. Miss Jiang’s victory at twenty-seven thousand taels, though exorbitant, secured her prize. The cloaked bidder’s resignation hinted at emptied coffers.

“Detestable creature! Comparing wealth to mine?” Miss Jiang huffed triumphantly.

Chu Fan interjected, “Even imperial gifts have limits. This exceeds reason.”

“Twenty-two thousand!” she ignored him.

The cloaked man’s final bid—twenty-five thousand—met her crushing response. His admission of defeat (“I cannot afford it”) closed the contest.

Guan Yu observed the interplay. For cultivators, such gemstones warranted any sacrifice. Yet financial constraints bound even the ambitious. Miss Jiang’s whims had triumphed—this round, at least.
