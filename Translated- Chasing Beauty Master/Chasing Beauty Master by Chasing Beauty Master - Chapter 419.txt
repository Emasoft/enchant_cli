“It’s not yet Wan Qianshan’s turn to call the shots in this company! What gives you the right to speak?” Guan Yu looked down upon these men like a demonic deity, his gaze sweeping over them before he strode toward Wan Qianshan’s office.

***

Watching this unfold through surveillance footage, Wan Qianshan instinctively shuddered. A flicker of fear arose in his heart, but within moments, his ambition surged back.

“So what if he’s strong? Even the strongest fighter can’t defeat a mob alone! I refuse to believe a dozen of my men can’t handle one measly Guan Yu!”

Taking a deep breath, Wan Qianshan pushed open his office door and stepped out.

The two men collided in the hallway, their eyes locking. An inexplicable chill permeated the air, as if winter’s bitterest frost had descended.

Any observer could see the invisible battle of wills raging between them.

**Chapter 1048: Crushing the Rotten and Smashing the Decayed**

As titans of their respective underworld domains, both Guan Yu and Wan Qianshan radiated an aura that dwarfed ordinary men. Their mere gaze lowered the temperature of the room, sending shivers through the spines of weaker onlookers.

Wan Qianshan had believed capturing Li Xi would bolster his confidence, ensuring he wouldn’t crumble quickly against Guan Yu. Yet the latter’s calm smile and unreadable demeanor unnerved him. Within minutes, Wan Qianshan forced a greasy grin. “Well, what brings the great Guan Lao-Da here? Forgive my lack of hospitality!”

His words eased the tension. Many in the office dared to scrutinize Guan Yu—this audacious stranger who dared lock eyes with their boss.

Guan Yu had always adhered to a policy of absolute trust in business. Since Li Xi handled Taiwan affairs, it was natural local staff didn’t recognize him.

“Hmph. Wan Qianshan, it seems you’ve managed the company splendidly.”

With technological support from Guan Yu’s headquarters and Li Xi’s capable deputies, the Taiwan branch had flourished smoothly, contradicting Wan Qianshan’s claims of financial strain—a ruse to lure Guan Yu and Li Xi into his trap.

Now halfway through his scheme, Wan Qianshan saw no need for pretense.

With a cold smirk, he said, “Care to step inside for a chat, Guan Lao-Da?”

“Gladly.” Without hesitation, Guan Yu marched into the office and claimed the CEO’s seat.

Wan Qianshan’s expression twitched before he composed himself, locking the door and sitting opposite. “To what do we owe this visit?”

“Drop the act. Where’s Li Xi?” Guan Yu’s tone carried lethal frost.

Under Guan Yu’s viper-like stare, Wan Qianshan faltered. “How would I know Director Li’s whereabouts?”

“Since when does the mighty Wan Lao-Da lack courage?” Guan Yu sneered. “Cross me, and I’ll make you beg for death.”

He slammed the desk. Instantly, Wan Qianshan felt thousands of phantom ants gnawing his bones—agonizing, unbearable.

“Wh-what did you do to me?!”

“Did you think the parasite I implanted was decorative?” Guan Yu coldly remarked. Having anticipated betrayal, he’d planted this safeguard.

“You… vicious bastard!”

Wan Qianshan had dismissed the implant as a bluff—until now. The searing pain and itching tormented him beyond endurance.

“Likewise,” Guan Yu said impassively. “Tell me where Li Xi is, or regret it eternally.”

“Never! Kill me, and you’ll never find her! A worthy trade—my life for hers!”

Guan Yu frowned. He’d underestimated Wan Qianshan’s resolve. The parasite could inflict unbearable suffering, but overstimulation risked fatal overdose. Worse, desperate men might choose suicide.

Li Xi’s safety outweighed vengeance. Relenting, Guan Yu deactivated the parasite.

“Hah! Why stop? Keep torturing me!” Wan Qianshan raved, eyes bloodshot. “Your tricks are useless!”

A rational schemer turned madman was far more dangerous.

“This isn’t over,” Guan Yu warned. “When I find Li Xi, you’ll taste true hell.”

He turned to leave, but Wan Qianshan shouted, “Two days! Transfer the company to me and remove this curse, or Li Xi dies! Oh, and I’ve stationed men with… particular tastes to guard her. Such a beauty must tempt them!”

Guan Yu’s eyes blazed. He slammed the 10cm-thick marble desk—reducing it to powder with a thunderous crash.

“Harm her, and this will be your fate.”

Wan Qianshan gaped, his confidence crumbling.

**Chapter 1049: Li Xi’s Predicament**

A seasoned underworld veteran, Wan Qianshan had witnessed countless horrors. Yet seeing Guan Yu pulverize marble bare-handed instilled primal dread. Was this humanly possible?

“Boss? You alright?” His subordinate Xiao Hou interrupted.

“G-Guan Yu?”

“He left. What’s wrong?”

Wan Qianshan waved weakly. “Is Li Xi secure?”

“Hu-ge’s guarding her. No escapes.”

Hu-ge, his most reliable enforcer, had never failed. Still, shaken by Guan Yu’s display, Wan Qianshan ordered, “Contact Immigration’s Director Wang. Dinner tonight.”

“Any leads?” Lin Dong asked as Guan Yu returned to the hotel. Song Xiaoya watched silently, curious about Li Xi’s identity.

“Wan Qianshan’s all-in. We proceed alone.”

As Guan Yu pondered, Song Xiaoya massaged his temples. Lin Dong pressed, “Your plan?”

After a long pause, Guan Yu produced a slip of paper. “Time to call him.”

***

Li Xi had been captive for days, held in a derelict factory surrounded by thugs.

Regret gnawed at her. She’d walked into the trap, knowing Wan Qianshan’s treachery. Now, under the lecherous gazes of guards, she clung to hope—Guan Yu would come.

“Hu-ge, when can we have fun with her?” a thug whispered.

The bald leader snorted. “Touch her, and I’ll bury you myself.”

A越野车 roared in. Wan Qianshan approached Li Xi. “Last chance—persuade Guan Yu to surrender the company.”

“Never.”

Furious, he threatened, “My men would enjoy breaking you!”

“Lay a finger on me, and I’ll die here.”

Wan Qianshan punched the wall. “Two days. If Guan Yu fails, you die.”

**Chapter 1050: The Hacker**

At the Hilton’s VIP lounge, Guan Yu met a peculiar youth—thick glasses, pink bowtie clashing with his black suit.

“You’re Guan Yu? I’m Cao Xiping. The Jiangs don’t meet outsiders.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Not Jiang?”

“She’s no ‘Mr. Jiang.’”

“She?”

Cao Xiping smirked. “Easton Mu oversold you. But since I’m stuck here… let’s talk.”
