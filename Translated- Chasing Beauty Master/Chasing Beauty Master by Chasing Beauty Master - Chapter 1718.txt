Now, Ling Su finally understood the situation here. Following Ma Zhagen upstairs through the stairwell—though whether this was truly the base level remained unclear—they arrived at a moderately sized chamber.

"Here lies our clan leader's residence," Ma Zhagen declared. "Though the leader is absent and I cannot introduce you, as sworn friends, I shall honor you with our finest hospitality. Shortly, provisions shall be prepared. Please await here."

"Deepest gratitude, Brother Ma Zhagen," Ling Su feigned earnestness. "Without your aid, I'd have perished by enemy blades." This towering oaf, for all his formidable appearance, revealed himself a simpleton.

"Ho, Zhagen! What brings you here? Has the clan leader returned?" A newcomer entered—a burly man dwarfed by Ma Zhagen's bulk, though his barrel chest and mountainous shoulders bespoke considerable strength.

Ling Su exchanged silent glances with the arrival. "Allow introductions," Ma Zhagen interposed. "This new companion is Ling Su. Here stands Hada Bei, my sworn brother since infancy."

"Greetings, stranger," Hada Bei grinned. "Any friend of Ma Zhagen's is kin to our Ha Clan. Welcome."

Ling Su smiled courteously, accepting the honor of Ha hospitality. These tribesmen's friendship might prove valuable—a potential sanctuary should future roads turn treacherous.

"The pleasure is mine," he replied. "Your noble camaraderie warms my heart. Such loyal friends are rare treasures."

Hada Bei chuckled. "When I saw Zhagen escorting someone upward, I hoped the leader had returned. Instead, we gain fresh companionship."

"Since we've new fellowship," he continued, "should we not toast with cups of joy?"

Ma Zhagen hesitated—his beloved Xiao Mei awaited—yet tribal custom demanded celebration. After brief contemplation, he nodded. "Indeed! I'll fetch provisions for proper revelry with Brother Ling Su."

"Make haste then!" Hada Bei boomed. "I'll keep our friend company. Fear not—none surpass my hospitality!"

With assurances given, Ma Zhagen departed. Ling Su maintained his smile, marveling at their earnest reception. This respite suited him perfectly—while Guan Yu's pursuit lingered, these simpletons might yet prove useful allies.

Observing the two muscular tribesmen, Ling Su recognized their physical prowess. Earlier at the ancient well, he'd witnessed similar giants hauling water buckets effortlessly, their bronzed torsos rippling like ancient oaks.

After Ma Zhagen's departure, Ling Su studied Hada Bei—the man's obsidian skin stretched over compact muscles, his frame broader though no taller than Ling Su's slender build.

"Brother Hada Bei," Ling Su ventured, "your physiques astonish me. Compared to your might, I appear but a sapling before ancient pines."

"Non-Ha men needn't concern themselves," Hada Bei laughed. "Our boys begin training when they toddle—strength defines Ha masculinity. Methods vary, as do talents, hence hierarchical distinctions."

"But I noticed corpulent men below," Ling Su pressed. "Do they not train?"

"All Ha males train," came the reply. "Those bulkier follow different regimens—their mass isn't fat, but cultivated weight for specialized combat. Let me elucidate..."

Seating himself, Hada Bei continued: "My kind pursues pure strength. Our legendary champion once lifted a thousand-jin ox single-handed! The heavier ones become wrestlers—powerful, yet lacking our absolute force."

Ling Su nodded comprehension. "So your clan reveres strength above all. Which method typically produces champions?"

"Ours, undoubtedly," Hada Bei asserted. "The heavy wrestlers compete separately. Last year's champion was Ma Zhagen, but..." He trailed off meaningfully.

Ling Su detected hidden implications. "Why the hesitation? Surely the chief's son remains formidable?"

Hada Bei's expression clouded. "Some matters... better discussed with Zhagen himself."

As if summoned, Ma Zhagen returned bearing jugs. "What secrets do you worms whisper?" he boomed mock-threateningly.

"None dare slight you," Hada Bei raised hands placatingly. "Your fists teach lessons too painfully!"

Chapter 4495: Revelations

Ling Su pressed further: "Brother Ma Zhagen, Hada Bei mentioned this year's championship approaches. He implied your reign might end. Why?"

"Preposterous!" Ma Zhagen thundered. "Since adulthood, none have bested me! The chief's blood ensures supremacy!"

Yet Ling Su noted Hada Bei's suppressed smirk. Last year's narrow victory and Ma Zhagen's recent distraction with Xiao Mei had eroded his edge—a truth both knew but unspoken.

"Your traditions fascinate me," Ling Su redirected. "What purpose does this lifelong strength pursuit serve?"

"Honor and privilege!" Hada Bei interjected. "The champion ranks second only to the chief! Women flock to him, the finest becoming his bride—this is every Ha man's dream!"

Ma Zhagen hefted wine vessels. "Enough talk! Let proper feasting commence!"

As servers entered bearing trays of delicacies, two tribesmen followed carrying a spit-roasted lamb. Ling Su's mouth watered—such luxury unexpected in desert wastes!

Chapter 4496: The Feast

"The lamb requires proper roasting," Ma Zhagen declared. "Let us first drink and sample lesser dishes!"

Hada Bei stared in surprise—this reception surpassed ordinary hospitality. Ha Clan's guest rituals stratified strictly, and Ling Su's treatment indicated highest honor.

As wine flowed, Ling Su's mind whirred. These muscle-bound fools' secret training methods intrigued him—knowledge that could elevate his own power, perhaps even surpass Guan Yu. Though tribal secrets were guarded, perhaps Ma Zhagen's simple nature could be exploited...

For now, he raised his cup, the perfect image of grateful camaraderie. Let them think him a harmless fugitive. When the time came, their strength would become his stepping stones.
