John and the others had indeed guessed that Guan Yu's arrival in the Arctic wasn't solely to deal with the polar bears. Maintaining tactful silence, they returned to their barracks after seeing him off.

Several sentries conducting patrols later whispered to John: "We observed Guan Yu's departure direction through binoculars. He's completely vanished from the ice plain already! They left mere minutes ago – even an aircraft couldn't disappear from view this quickly!"

John chuckled. "Intelligence reports state Guan Yu's current power can only be described as divine – surpassing anything ever witnessed on our planet. How could we mortals comprehend a deity's speed? We once considered ourselves top-tier mutants striding unopposed through this world. Now compared to him, we're utterly insignificant."

As they conversed, another sentry rushed in. "John! Jones has fled again! Our receivers can't detect his tracker signal. He either fell into a crevasse or ventured beyond twenty kilometers."

Twenty centimeters of fresh snow blanketed the terrain. A companion spat: "That foolhardy twenty-year-old! Too young and clean-recorded for mutation trials. Kept clamoring for experimentation despite polar bear threats. Probably plunged into some hundred-meter crevasse with seawater beneath. Dead for sure."

John mused pensively. "Cease the search. Life and death are matters of fate."

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Xue Jing wandered the ice plain with five cubs in tow. At four hundred meters from camp, a figure emerged from snowdrifts – a lanky twenty-year-old with chestnut hair and jade eyes blocking their path.

"Greetings sir! I'm Jones, American." The youth bore neither mutant nor pseudo-ESP aura.

Guan Yu nodded courteously. "I'm Guan Yu. This is my sister Xue Jing. How may we assist?"

Xue Jing pouted. "Don't listen! I'm his wife – fifth in line! Liu Shilei, Du Xiaojuan, Sun Xiaoya, Ouyang Yihan, then me!"

Jones gaped at this polygamous revelation from modern times. Collecting himself, he implored: "Forgive my boldness! Are you attending mutation trials? I witnessed your bear subjugation – surely you're a mutant? If Miss Xue undergoes experimentation, might I accompany you? I swear not to burden..."

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. "Trials are suspended due to bear mutations. We pursue other Arctic objectives. Return to camp and await..."

Undeterred, Jones pressed: "Are you a top-tier mutant? Your power surpasses..."

Xue Jing interjected haughtily: "Top mutants? My husband could crush them with a pinky! These cubs terrified first-class mutants, yet he subdued five effortlessly!"

**Chapter 1754: The Apprentice**

Jones had hidden during the attack, following the "play dead" strategy. The unprecedented battle's outcome – bears transformed into pets – left him awestruck. Here stood an Eastern divinity who might help avenge his family's massacre by New Orleans mutants who seized their generations-old machinery empire.

*Thud!* Jones kowtowed thrice on ice. Xue Jing giggled: "Little brother, seeking apprenticeship through prostration?"

The twenty-year-old (actually older than nineteen-year-old Xue Jing) completed his ritual before declaring: "Divine one from the East! Take me as disciple! I'll serve faithfully, learn your arts, and..."

Guan Yu massaged his temples at the comically formal entreaty. "Why seek apprenticeship? You're no criminal – why join these condemned trial participants?"

Jones recounted his tragedy – family exterminated, forced exile, desperate gamble for mutation-powered vengeance. Xue Jing wept openly while Guan Yu remained impassive, having witnessed countless such tragedies across decades.

"Darling, help him!" Xue Jing tugged Guan Yu's sleeve.

The cultivator exhaled deeply. "Jones, answer this: After gaining vengeance, what then?"

The youth faltered, never considering post-retribution purpose. As he pondered, Guan Yu walked onward, Jones scrambling after like duckling imprinting.

"Mutants seem mighty," Guan Yu mused, "yet compared to true powers within the Divine Miracles, I'm insignificant. Like peeling eggshells – each breakthrough reveals vaster heavens beyond."

When Xue Jing complained about trudging through snow, Jones gaped as they levitated skyward. The American screamed mid-air until realizing the spiritual energy barrier's safety. From this aerial vantage, they observed the polar nexus – a tower-like Miracle encircled by sentry camps, and yawning crevasses where bear-controlling entities might lurk.

During descent, Jones pressed: "Will you teach me?"

Guan Yu countered: "Before answering, define your post-vengeance purpose. Will you become like your oppressors?"

"Never!" Jones shook vehemently. "My suffering taught me wisdom. You revealed infinite cultivation realms – I wish to pursue these heights!"
