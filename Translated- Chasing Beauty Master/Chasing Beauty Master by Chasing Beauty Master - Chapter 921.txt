“I didn’t hear what Second-to-Wolf said at all,” Sakura replied casually, utterly bewildering Second and Acai. Second-to-Wolf sighed helplessly, “I was asking what we should eat later. What does that have to do with Guan Yu? Are you so obsessed with him you’ve gone mad?”

“I’ve always been mad. Didn’t you know, brother?” Sakura retorted indifferently. “I’ll eat anything. You two decide. But I don’t want to go out. Just bring me something when you return.”

“Alright then.” Second-to-Wolf realized Sakura had no interest in leaving. He resigned himself to bringing back fast food later, suspecting she’d lie awake all night. Suddenly, he regretted telling her the news.

“Let’s go, Acai.” With no other choice, Second-to-Wolf left with Acai.

Guan Yu had obediently stayed home for two days under Xue Jing’s watchful eye. The moment he stepped outside, she followed.

To make matters worse, Xu Jinglei had called the previous night, insisting Xue Jing accompany Guan Yu if he left again—or he wouldn’t be allowed out.

Trapped indoors, Guan Yu couldn’t bear it any longer. He needed to check on Uncle Qing’s condition.

“Xue Jing, let’s go out.” This time, Guan Yu played by the rules, inviting her along.

“Sure! Wait while I change. Where are we going?” Xue Jing called out, darting toward her bedroom.

“Women and their endless preparations,” Guan Yu muttered under his breath. “We’re visiting Uncle Qing.”

It was indeed time. Since Ling’er had taken leave to care for her father, there’d been no updates. Yang Conghan had returned to Huaye Club to manage accounts alone, having promised Ling’er she’d keep her position open.

Half an hour later, Xue Jing still hadn’t emerged. “Are you done yet?” Guan Yu called impatiently.

“Almost!” When she finally appeared, she wore sleek black athletic wear that accentuated her fair skin, topped with a baseball cap. Her white sneakers bounced as she grinned. “Let’s go!”

Accustomed to seeing her in pajamas, Guan Yu had almost forgotten Xue Jing’s sporty side. As he stood to leave, a door slammed upstairs.

“Wait for me!” Zhang Han’s voice echoed as she wobbled down like a rolling dumpling. “I want to come too!”

“Aren’t you gaming?” Guan Yu asked.

“You’re visiting Ling’er’s house! I wanna see it!” She latched onto his arm, refusing to let go. Guan Yu relented—she’d clearly eavesdropped and dressed in record time, likely with A-Mei or Li Chunmei’s help.

“Fine, let’s go.”

Settling into the Da Hang’s driver seat, Guan Yu felt a wave of nostalgia. After a quick stop for gifts and Zhang Han’s snacks, they headed to the countryside.

Zhang Han chattered nonstop during the drive, while Xue Jing patiently humored her. Guan Yu stayed silent, worried about Uncle Qing’s worsening condition. Only Jin Hua’s grandmaster could save him now—if she was even alive.

Remembering You Dun’s words about his ailing, elderly master, Guan Yu accelerated down the rural roads.

At the familiar village outskirts, Guan Yu parked. The Da Hang’s low chassis couldn’t handle unpaved paths. They’d have to walk—a realization that made him miss Pan Taisheng’s rugged pickup truck.

Halfway through the hike, Zhang Han plopped down, pouting. “Carry me! I’m tired!”

Xue Jing coaxed, “Your dress is getting dirty.”

Guan Yu sighed. The girl wore a frilly dress and white Mary Janes, now dust-streaked. Relenting, he crouched. Zhang Han leaped onto his back, cheering, “Giddyup, donkey!”

By the time they reached Ling’er’s house, Zhang Han had fallen asleep. Xue Jing woke her by threatening, “Your snacks will be gone!”

“Don’t touch them!” Zhang Han yelped, scrambling down. She rummaged through gift bags until finding a mysterious round object. “My present for Ling’er!”

“What is that?” Guan Yu asked, but she dashed off.

In the yard, Zhang Han nearly uncovered a quilt-shrouded pile until Guan Yu stopped her. “Don’t touch! It’s dangerous.”

Ling’er and her mother emerged, both aged drastically. The once-vibrant Ling’er now looked gaunt and sallow.

“Sister Ling’er, are you sick?” Zhang Han blurted. “Go see Grandpa Yang! He fixes everything!”

The group entered, unaware of the trials ahead—and the venomous snakes hidden under that quilt.
