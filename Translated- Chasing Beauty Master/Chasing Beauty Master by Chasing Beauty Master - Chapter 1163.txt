“Xue Jing pursed her lips and said, “I’m not worried about you stealing him anyway. It’s not like he belongs to me alone. There are several others at home, and who knows how many more outside. If you think your charms are sufficient, be my guest.”

Xue Jing’s remark about “several others at home” was deliberately aimed at Lin Qiaoqiao, implying that Guan Yu was surrounded by beauties and might not spare her a glance.

“I think my charms are more than enough. The line of men chasing me could stretch all the way to the police station. And I’ve never been in a relationship before—fresh goods, you see,” Lin Qiaoqiao declared unabashedly, tilting her chin upward.

Everyone believed this. Lin Qiaoqiao had never lacked suitors, from the sons of high-ranking officials to ordinary young men. While claiming her admirers could form a line reaching the police station might sound boastful, the actual number wouldn’t fall far short.

The police subordinates following behind exchanged bewildered glances. This was the first time they’d heard their beautiful captain speak so boldly. Something felt off today, leaving them utterly confused.

Within the police bureau, their captain wielded more authority than the chief himself. Male colleagues eagerly catered to her every whim, never daring to voice dissent. Lin Qiaoqiao reigned supreme, treated like royalty despite her official title.

Xue Jing bristled at Lin Qiaoqiao’s words. “Who cares if you’re ‘fresh goods’? And for the record, no one here is ‘secondhand’!” She recalled her early days with Guan Yu—how he’d helped her family when she was young, leading to their relationship. Guan Yu remained her first and only man, making Lin’s insinuations about multiple partners particularly grating.

“I never called you secondhand,” Lin retorted. “I’m just saying men these days crave novelty. They grow bored with what’s familiar. Only new arrivals whet their appetites.”

Guan Yu sensed the brewing storm. Xue Jing’s jealousy threatened to shatter their longstanding friendship. “Captain Lin,” he interjected, “let’s focus on urgent matters. Time is pressing.”

Lin Qiaoqiao immediately brightened, turning to Guan Yu with a saccharine smile. “Of course! Do tell me everything.”

“Here’s the situation,” Guan Yu began, seating himself. “My factory’s been working overtime due to heavy production demands. But we’ve noticed discrepancies in finished goods inventory. Upon reviewing surveillance footage, I discovered significant issues.”

He paused. “Workers are systematically stealing products and smuggling them out via garbage trucks. Let’s review the footage in the monitoring room.”

Lin nodded. “Lead the way, Boss Guan Yu.” Even Wang Hu, usually oblivious, noticed her uncharacteristic deference.

**Chapter 2979: The Arrest (Part 1)**

Wang Hu seethed with envy. Every beautiful woman gravitated toward Guan Yu, as if he possessed some mystical charm. The lumbering bodyguard made a mental note to seek his boss’s secret someday.

The monitoring room visit startled Jing Boyan. Seeing police, he initially feared arrest. Guan Yu reassured him: “Don’t worry, Brother Jing. They’re here to investigate. Please show them the surveillance records.”

“But I already gave you a copy,” Jing protested.

“I didn’t bring it. We’ll review here.” Guan Yu’s politeness eased Jing’s nerves. As the footage played, Guan Yu explained the theft patterns—echoing Jing’s earlier report.

Lin Qiaoqiao alternated between watching the screen and stealing coy glances at Guan Yu, her smoldering looks unsettling him. After viewing, she concluded: “This shows premeditated, large-scale theft. Our first target should be the garbage truck.”

Wang Hu stepped forward. “I tracked the vehicle and photographed its route.” Inserting a memory card, he displayed images of a red-gated warehouse. “This stores stolen goods. The man in these shots is their ringleader.”

Lin studied the images. “Wait—this wheelchair user... Sun Xu?”

“Exactly. You know him?” Guan Yu asked.

“Don’t you remember? I mediated your fight with him!” Lin’s voice turned syrupy. “That’s when I learned about him.”

The recollection surfaced. “Right. Now he works for Bill Lynn. His men stole my factory’s leather. With evidence secured, arrest them before they sell the goods.” Guan Yu handed Lin a list of five names provided by Jing.

Jing interjected: “I advise arresting only three from the footage first. Mass arrests would alert Sun Xu. Capture the rest gradually.”

Guan Yu approved. “Sound strategy. Captain Lin, take those three initially.”

As Lin mobilized her team, Guan Yu realized a flaw: While workers could be caught red-handed, implicating Sun Xu required confessions. Without testimony, the mastermind might walk free within hours.

**Chapter 2980: The Arrest (Part 2)**

Rushing outside, Guan Yu called Lin: “We need Sun Xu caught in the act. Delay the warehouse raid. I’ll investigate the southern district first.”

Vehicle logistics proved troublesome. Xue Jing’s red Ferrari stood out too conspicuously. Ultimately, Hou Jinshun fetched them in an unremarkable car while Xue stayed behind.

Reaching the southern riverfront, they spotted Wang Hu’s described junkyard. The crimson warehouse gates glared conspicuously. Parking discreetly, they observed from afar.

“The gates are open. Should we approach?” Hou suggested.

“Too risky. Sun might recognize me. You go—few know you.”

Hou ambled casually toward the compound, cigarette in hand. Near the gates, he heard voices and clanging metal. Peering inside, he saw workers loading crates onto trucks—but no Sun Xu.

**Chapter 2981: The Arrest (Finale)**

Upon Hou’s report, Guan Yu summoned Lin’s team. Three police cars descended on the warehouse. Officers stormed in, shouting: “Freeze! Police!”

Confused laborers froze mid-task—mere hired hands unaware of the criminal enterprise. A balding landlord scurried to Lin, oozing false charm: “Officer, surely we can resolve this? I’m just the renter!”

“Seal the warehouses,” Lin ordered. “Take everyone in for questioning—including drivers.”

Guan Yu arrived as Lin lamented Sun Xu’s absence. “At least we recovered the leather. But preserve it carefully—it’s evidence.”

“Don’t worry,” Lin purred. “We’ll return everything intact.” Her honeyed tone sent shivers through Guan Yu.

The landlord’s furtive call to Sun Xu went unchecked—Guan Yu wanted the mastermind drawn out. Soon, a car arrived bearing Sun Xu in a wheelchair. The moment he saw Guan Yu, his face paled.

“Sun Xu,” Guan Yu smiled coldly. “Still useful to Bill Lynn despite those legs? Work with me instead—better prospects.”

Sun’s facial muscles twitched. His meticulously hidden operation lay exposed, overseas medical hopes dashed. With police present, prison loomed unless Bill Lynn intervened.

“Let’s negotiate,” Sun stammered. “We’re both underworld figures. Involving police isn’t proper!”

Guan Yu’s smile held no warmth. The game had reached its endgame.
