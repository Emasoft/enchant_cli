“Well then, since you refuse to betray the Yunqing Sect, as long as you’re willing to be with me, I’ll betray the Demon Soul Sect and become your wife at the Yunqing Sect. Does that satisfy you?” Wang Xiaorong declared shamelessly. Her mind was wholly consumed by Guan Yu—day and night, she thought of him, and even a moment without him pained her. This time, she had sneaked out under the pretense of inviting Guan Yu to the Demon Soul Sect.

Never in her life had Wang Xiaorong harbored feelings for any man. Not even the Demon Lord occupied her heart. Guan Yu was the first and only one. As a young woman newly awakened to love, she believed that when one encountered someone they adored, they should pursue them boldly without hesitation.

Guan Yu shook his head helplessly. “You’re overthinking this. Perhaps you don’t realize how deeply the orthodox sects despise your kind. To put it plainly, if you went to the Yunqing Sect, the sect leader and elders would capture you to threaten the Demon Lord. You’d have no escape.”

Wang Xiaorong pursed her lips upon hearing this. “Seems the methods of your righteous sects aren’t much nobler than ours. All crows under the sun are equally black—stop pretending to be morally superior.”

Guan Yu let her have the last word. “Just return and inform the Demon Lord that I’ll visit the Demon Soul Sect when the time is right.”

**Chapter 3,457: A Form of Amusement**

“Do you truly wish to go?” Wang Xiaorong studied him suspiciously. “Planning to spy on something at the Demon Soul Sect? Don’t delude yourself. You might not survive the visit. I advise you to abandon such foolish notions.”

“Would the Demon Lord truly kill me? I’m a nobody. Surely he wouldn’t go to such lengths?” Guan Yu probed, trusting she wouldn’t lie to him now.

“You’re worth it. My father knows you’re cultivating both demonic and martial arts. Your future threat to the Demon Soul Sect is immense. Before you mature, he’ll either recruit you or eliminate you. Tell me—doesn’t that justify killing you?”

“So that’s it. It seems spies in the Yunqing Sect are plentiful, even leaking my dual cultivation.” Guan Yu chuckled. “Still, even if the Demon Lord wants me dead, you’d protect me, wouldn’t you?”

He tossed the dilemma back to her. “Me? Protect you? A fine idea, but if Father truly desires your death, I might be your only hope. Yet when enraged, he recognizes neither kin nor reason. With his entourage of experts, even my efforts would be futile.”

“The best solution is for you to marry me. As my husband, Father wouldn’t harm you—he’d never wish widowhood upon me. Hehehe!” Wang Xiaorong grinned mischievously.

The conversation circled back yet again. Clearly, pursuing Guan Yu was her sole purpose for seeking him out.

“Can we discuss something else? Must you always be so forward? Have some dignity!” Guan Yu teased.

“Hmph! I’m already speaking shamelessly. Besides, what other topics interest me?” Wang Xiaorong retorted, hands clasped behind her back.

As Guan Yu conversed with the beauty on the street, watchful eyes observed from the Echo Pavilion’s windows.

Xiliu stood by her window, idly gazing at the bustling crowd below when she spotted Guan Yu. His extravagant spending during his last visit with Young Master Men had left a deep impression. But upon noticing Wang Xiaorong, her expression darkened. Guan Yu—supposedly an aristocrat from the capital—consorting with a demonic cultivator? This complicated matters.

At another window, Cuihua stood absorbed. Like Xiliu, she found amusement in watching the lively streets, as the Echo Pavilion’s entertainers were forbidden from leaving without permission. Since Guan Yu’s last visit, Cuihua had rejected all other patrons, pleading with the proprietress to reserve herself exclusively for him. His noble demeanor, charm, and integrity had captivated her utterly.

Noticing Guan Yu below, she saw him speaking intimately with a girl who clung to his arm. Though Cuihua couldn’t hear their words, a pang of jealousy struck her. Fearing Guan Yu might never return unless she acted, she resolved to invite him upstairs, even at the risk of angering his companion.

“Guan Yu? Since you’re here, why not join me for tea upstairs?” Cuihua called softly from behind him.

Wang Xiaorong, mid-argument about marriage, whirled to face the newcomer—a delicate girl with butterfly-shaped hairpins and a gauzy silk dress that hinted at pale skin beneath. Her downcast eyes and timid posture marked her as one of the pavilion’s entertainers.

“Oh? Guan Yu, you know her?” Wang Xiaorong arched a brow, glancing at the Echo Pavilion.

Recognizing Cuihua, Guan Yu seized the chance to dampen Wang Xiaorong’s ardor. “Yes, I frequent the Echo Pavilion. Let me introduce Cuihua, an entertainer here, and this is Miss Wang—”

“Silence!” Wang Xiaorong snapped. “You expect me to believe you’ve ‘frequented’ this place in your short time here? Pathetic lie!”

Cuihua interjected nervously, “Please don’t misunderstand! Guan Yu only visited once, but his generosity left an impression. I merely wished to repay his kindness with free tea today.”

Guan Yu, pitying her anxiety, reassured her. “Pay her no mind. She’s always like this.”

Wang Xiaorong huffed. “The man I chose couldn’t be so vulgar. You were just provoking me! After all my efforts, is this how you repay me?” She clung to Guan Yu’s arm, glaring defiantly at Cuihua.

**Chapter 3,458: I Admit**

Upstairs, Xiliu summoned a maid. “Fetch Cuihua immediately. Say an important client demands her.”

As the maid departed, Wang Xiaorong berated Guan Yu. “You’re no true man, toying with women’s hearts! First Siqi, then Xiaotong, now me—and you even frequent brothels? Disgusting!”

Guan Yu sighed. “If you insist on believing that, perhaps we should part ways. Someone like me isn’t worthy of—”

“Nonsense! I don’t care!” Wang Xiaorong declared. “I defied the Demon Soul Sect for you! Where you go, I follow—even to this den!”

Spotting an approaching maid calling Cuihua away, Wang Xiaorong grew suspicious. “Let’s investigate this Echo Pavilion. Treat me to their famed delicacies!”

“A woman dining here? You’ll be ridiculed.”

“Since when can’t women eat? I’m going!” She dragged him toward the entrance.

**Chapter 3,459: Investigate**

Inside, Xiliu admonished Cuihua: “The Demon Lord’s daughter mustn’t suspect anything. Alert the others to act naturally.”

As Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong entered, the pavilion’s staff masked their tension. Wang Xiaorong surveyed the opulent hall triumphantly, arm locked with Guan Yu’s—a clear warning to any rivals.

Meanwhile, Cuihua wrestled with her heartache. She knew aristocratic men like Guan Yu had many admirers, yet the sight of him with another pierced her deeply. For now, duty overrode desire—survival depended on maintaining illusions.

Guan Yu resigned himself to the ordeal. This stubborn demonic maiden would cling like a leech, her infatuation unshaken by reason. As they settled at a table, he wondered which posed greater danger: the Demon Soul Sect’s schemes or this relentless admirer.
