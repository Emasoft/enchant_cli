“A certain number… If I could get seventy or eighty tigers and lions, wouldn’t that truly make me the forest overlord, king of all beasts?” Guan Yu stood dumbfounded, as if a giant cake had suddenly fallen from the sky and completely overwhelmed him.

Chapter 39: The Pigeon King

After activating the pet system, Guan Yu wandered through the flower-and-bird market with Du Xiaojuan, occasionally communicating with small birds in cages while accompanying her sightseeing.

With the pet system activated, Guan Yu discovered he could mentally communicate with these small creatures. However, after several experiments, he quickly lost interest.

These small animals' minds proved too simplistic—filled only with fear and hunger, their intelligence inferior to a three-year-old child's. Raising such pets would make communication difficult, let alone giving them instructions!

Considering the system's limited pet capacity, Guan Yu had no intention of casually choosing any random bird for summoning.

“Better select an intelligent one… or perhaps something valuable,” Guan Yu mused. Remembering the pigeon sold for an exorbitant price earlier, he paid special attention to pigeon vendors during their stroll.

After half an hour of appraising various pigeons using his system's scoring, Guan Yu found none surpassing the 1.2 million yuan pigeon's flight score of 120. This realization dampened his spirits—apparently, stumbling upon such windfalls wasn't easy.

As Guan Yu and Du Xiaojuan prepared to leave, a teenage boy's bicycle-mounted pigeon cage caught his eye. The scruffy fledgling inside resembled a prickly hedgehog with half-formed feathers.

“Could such a pathetic pigeon even survive?” Guan Yu scoffed internally, instinctively using his appraisal skill.

His foot faltered mid-step, nearly tripping. The system showed a staggering 304 flight score, with physique, health, and lung capacity ratings far exceeding the expensive pigeon. After double-checking, Guan Yu rushed over excitedly.

“Younger brother, are these pigeons for sale?”

The sixteen-year-old boy nodded solemnly. “How much? This fledgling hasn't even left the nest yet. Why sell it so young?” Guan Yu asked, wanting to avoid future disputes.

The boy sighed like a miniature adult. “I got them from someone. My family complains about the mess. I want to find them a good home.”

Satisfied with this explanation, Guan Yu declared, “I'll take them! How much?”

“Will you treat them well?”

“Absolutely!” Guan Yu vowed.

As they negotiated, nearby vendors sauntered over. “Young man, why buy those hatchlings? They can't even eat properly yet—you'll never raise them,” one middle-aged vendor warned.

Unfazed, Guan Yu asked the boy's price. “One hundred yuan, cage included,” the youth said, glaring at the meddlers.

A vendor scoffed, “That cage's worth twenty! You're charging eighty for two bald chicks? Come see my quality pigeons—thirty each with free cage!”

Guan Yu ignored them, promptly paying the boy. As he walked away carrying his purchase, vendors mocked, “What an idiot wasting money on those runts!”

Passing the specialty pigeon vendor's car on their return, the self-proclaimed “King of Pigeons” called out, “New purchase? Let me assess them—I’ve raised champion breeds for years!”

Though hesitant, Guan Yu approached. The man tsked, “Decent bone structure but inferior eyes. Middle-low grade, no potential.”

Guan Yu smiled blandly. Undeterred, the pigeon king boasted, “Come see my trophies! Real champions require premium bloodlines like my Janssens. Here's my card—raise those chicks for autumn nationals!”

Chapter 40: Charitable Contribution

Through the pigeon king's lecture, Guan Yu learned about competitive pigeon racing—chicks receive official leg bands before being sent to collective lofts for training. The first bird returning after release wins substantial prizes, sometimes reaching millions.

Though tempted by potential riches, Guan Yu remained realistic—national competitions attracted elite breeds. Still, his hundred-yuan gamble might pay off.

As they exited the market, Du Xiaojuan spotted a disabled charity lottery stall. “Let’s try our luck! My treat!” she begged like an excited child.

Normally skeptical of lotteries, Guan Yu indulged her. Watching Du Xiaojuan's childlike enthusiasm, he realized her sheltered upbringing fostered this innocent dependence on others.

While Du Xiaojuan listened raptly to the vendor's explanations, Guan Yu's fingers brushed the scratch cards. Activating his appraisal skill, he discovered a hidden 1,000 yuan winner.

“How much for this stack?” Guan Yu asked casually.

“Thirty-four yuan,” the vendor replied.

Du Xiaojuan protested, “That's gambling!”

“It's charity,” Guan Yu countered sanctimoniously. “Helping mountain children get education.”

Stunned by his sudden altruism, Du Xiaojuan watched him pay. As they scratched tickets, she suddenly shrieked, “We won! One thousand yuan!”

Chapter 41: Easy to Raise

The vendor verified the winning ticket and counted out cash. Spectators gathered as Du Xiaojuan waved the prize triumphantly. Guan Yu clenched a secret fist—his system worked perfectly.

“See? I told you we'd get lucky!” Du Xiaojuan preened, fanning herself with the ticket. Guan Yu noted her simple delight, thinking, “This girl's easily pleased—a cheap date indeed.”

Observing her wide-eyed excitement over trivial amusements, he mused that maintaining her happiness required minimal effort—a trait both endearing and concerning. As crowds congratulated them, Guan Yu pocketed the earnings discreetly, resolving to test his system's limits cautiously.
