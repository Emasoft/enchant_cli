“Oh, nothing. Just out for some fun,” Feng Xihu (West Lake Feng) replied dismissively. When Feng Jiawei saw Guan Yu sitting in the car, he immediately grew wary. “Xiao Hu, why are you with Guan Yu? Has he given you any trouble?”

“Trouble your head! Why must you meddle so much? Take your woman and scram!” Feng Xihu snapped irritably. Feng Jiawei shrank back like a startled kitten, knowing better than to provoke her temper. He hastily drove away.

Guan Yu frowned. He hadn’t expected Feng Jiawei to fear her so much. This didn’t seem staged. Could she genuinely be here for him? Despite her striking beauty, Guan Yu felt no goodwill toward anyone from the Feng family.

“Guan Yu, let’s date!” Feng Xihu’s sudden declaration nearly bowled him over.

“Nonsense. You should see a psychiatrist,” Guan Yu retorted.

Stung by his rejection, Feng Xihu flushed. She’d mustered such courage only to be dismissed as delusional. “Get out!” She yanked at his locked door before thrusting her pale arm through the window to unlock it from inside.

Before Guan Yu could react, she’d flung the door open and straddled his lap, arms coiling around his neck like a serpent as she pressed hungry kisses to his mouth. Guan Yu froze, hands hovering awkwardly. “Miss... people are watching! Stop—mmph!”

“Let them watch!” Feng Xihu hissed, her body undulating against his. By the time Guan Yu realized it, she’d undone all his shirt buttons, exposing his muscular chest.

Forced to act, Guan Yu shoved her off with force. Feng Xihu stumbled out as he slammed the door and sped away. Stamping her foot, she glared at his retreating taillights. “You’ll pay for this, Guan Yu! I’ll catch you, clean you up, and devour you bite by bite!”

Onlookers gaped at the beautiful girl’s venomous outburst, none daring to approach. Her clenched fists trembled as if already clutching her prey.

**Chapter 2057: Such Humiliation**

Guan Yu exhaled heavily. The notorious Feng family’s daughter proved more formidable than imagined. Was this a scheme? Unlikely—what father would use his daughter as bait? Could she truly fancy him? He shuddered. Better steer clear of such volatility.

While puzzling over her motives, Wei Hongwei called: “Guan-ge, did you deal with Feng Jiawei?”

“Ah... I’ll handle it. I’ll recover Yao Yao’s losses.” Hanging up, Guan Yu smacked the steering wheel. “Damn Feng Xihu ruined everything!” Whether coincidence or conspiracy, vigilance was paramount.

Yet his mind replayed their encounter—the predatory passion, her serpentine embrace. Shaking his head, he bought breakfast for Jin Hua. The vendor auntie kept smirking until Guan Yu snapped internally: *What’s wrong with you?*

Returning, he found Jin Hua’s room empty. Panic struck until she emerged fresh from bathing. “You scared me! Don’t get your wounds wet!”

“I know.” Jin Hua’s coy glance froze. “Did you... go out like *this*?”

“Huh?” Rushing to the mirror, Guan Yu cursed. His face and neck bloomed with lipstick marks—one a vivid hickey. Now he understood the auntie’s amusement. “Damn you, Feng Xihu!”

After scrubbing furiously, he covered the stubborn bruise with a bandage. Jin Hua giggled. “Who marked you so... enthusiastically?”

“That lunatic Feng Xihu ambushed me publicly! Claims I wronged her!”

Jin Hua’s eyes sparkled. “Women don’t do that without reason. She’s smitten.”

“Smitten? Her temper terrifies even Feng Jiawei! I’d rather wrestle tigers!”

**Chapter 2058: Overzealous Hospitality**

At school, Guan Yu investigated disturbing rumors: The new principal’s sister, “Yao Ji,” converted cafeteria floors into a KTV lounge. Worse—she recruited female students as hostesses.

“How is this tolerated?” Guan Yu demanded from teacher Pan Xiaoxia.

“Who dares oppose the principal?” She showed him Yao Ji’s curated chat group—dozens of beauties vetted for “entertainment.” Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed at Yao Ji’s photo—a blonde-bombed vixen in micro-skirted uniform.

Visiting the site, Guan Yu found three floors remade into plush KTV suites. Yao Ji descended like a golden-maned siren, her uniform straining over voluptuous curves. “So you’re Guan Yu! Care to play?”

Before he could refuse, she hauled him into a dim lounge where six made-up students descended. Two began dancing provocatively, uniforms revealing nothing beneath. Guan Yu’s jaw tightened as Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo succumbed to groping admirers.

**Chapter 2059: Enemy of the Campus**

“This ends now,” Guan Yu growled, shoving off a girl nibbling his ear. But Yao Ji pressed closer, breath hot. “Why resist? Everyone wins here.”

Guan Yu stood abruptly. “Not when exploitation’s involved.” Storming out, he ignored the chorus of boos. Behind him, Yao Ji’s laughter followed like a challenge.
