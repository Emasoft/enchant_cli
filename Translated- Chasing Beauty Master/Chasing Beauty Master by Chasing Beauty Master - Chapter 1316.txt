“What is all this shouting about? Have you no sense of decorum!” Elder Xiang's expression turned severe upon seeing other disciples following, clearly unwilling to reveal his partiality.

Wen Ming collapsed breathlessly after his desperate run. The journey from Zuokong Peak's rear caves to the southern woods stretched interminably, yet fear had driven him to sprint the entire way, his panicked mind forgetting even basic Sword Flight techniques.

Chapter 3397: Gambling With Life

Gasping like a landed fish before Elder Xiang, the youth finally released the terror constricting his throat. His trembling legs buckled, leaving him wheezing on the ground.

The elder took in the disheveled figure - flushed face streaked with grime, leaves clinging to rumpled robes like some escaped madman. “What catastrophe occurred? How did you become this wretched state?”

“Master... disaster!” Wen Ming jabbed a shaking finger southeast. “A-cai... in the woods... monster... too powerful...” His gulps for air fractured the account. “Hurry... save A-cai!”

“Monster? What business had you in those woods?” Elder Xiang's glare promised future reckoning, though the scent of wine clinging to Wen Ming's breath became secondary. “Lead us there! All of you - follow!”

With Sword Flight activated, the elder hauled Wen Ming skyward. Disciples trailed like startled sparrows to the designated clearing - where their gasps echoed through silent trees.

A-cai's bisected corpse glared crimson against the loam. Elder Xiang's eyes bulged in denial. “What demonry is this? Who dares?!” The roar shook branches. His treasured disciple - Zuokong Peak's brightest spark - lay sundered like firewood. Agony colder than mountain stone gripped the elder's heart.

Wen Ming shuddered, phantom claws of fear still raking his spine. But the clearing held only aftermath.

“Describe this beast!” Elder Xiang's voice cracked like whip. “I'll flay its hide for this atrocity!”

“Not human!” Wen Ming's hands sketched nightmare proportions. “Black-furred giant... fangs this long... palms like spades...”

As searching parties dispersed with halfhearted pretense (none wishing to encounter this terror), the elder cornered his trembling disciple. Wen Ming hung his head - their illicit outing now laid bare.

“Master... we grew bored in confinement... thought to hunt pheasants... roast meat with wine...” His whisper faltered. “The beast appeared behind A-cai... swatted him like fly... I ran...”

“Wretched fools!” The elder's slap echoed. “No barriers set, so you presume to carouse? Now your revels cost a life!”

“I beg forgiveness!” Wen Ming prostrated. “But the beast remains! Others may perish!”

Cold practicality cooled Elder Xiang's wrath. “Gather A-cai's remains. This demands the Sect Master's ear.” His sleeve flick brought gales churning earth - obliterating evidence of forbidden feasts before formal investigation.

Chapter 3398: Enlightened Servitude

Meanwhile, the frenzied killer roamed - humanity extinguished, bestial instincts honed by the Soul Demon Sect's Left Envoy who now observed with reptilian calm. Their clash ended predictably: the envoy's boot pinned the transformed disciple against oak, a Life-Sustaining Pill forced past fanged jaws.

As black fur receded to reveal pallid skin, consciousness returned. “What... have I done?” Qi Shixiong stared at blood-crusted hands.

“Merely slaughtered a junior disciple.” The envoy's smile held winter's bite. “Your Sect would execute you... unless protected.”

Realization dawned like poisoned sunrise. “I'm damned either way!”

“Not quite.” The envoy dangled a crystal vial. “This antidote flows from our generosity. Serve the Demon Lord, and live. Defy...” A shrug spoke volumes.

Qi's throat constricted. Years shackled to Blood Ridge's toxic "gifts" had eroded choice. “What... must I do?”

“Eyes within Cloud Azure Sect. Ears for our whispers.” The envoy's blade traced Qi's jugular. “Your transformation leaves no witnesses. Play loyal disciple by day, our agent by night. Refuse...” The vial disappeared. “...and next transformation becomes your last.”

Chapter 3399: Belated Wisdom

As Qi scrubbed bloodstains from borrowed robes, bitter enlightenment came. “All these years... had I controlled rage, conserved energy...” He glared at the smirking envoy. “You watched me kill! Delayed aid purposely!”

“Test passed proves loyalty.” The envoy tossed a fresh vial. “Remember - emotional restraint prolongs stability. Two months’ peace, if disciplined.”

Qi's fist clenched the antidote - keys to a gilded cage. The envoy's parting laugh carried through pines: “Welcome to the game, little spy. Let's see how Cloud Azure enjoys harboring vipers.”
