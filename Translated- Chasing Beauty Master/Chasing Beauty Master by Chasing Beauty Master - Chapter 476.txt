**Chapter 2005: Vampires**

*Clang! Clang!...* Amidst the violent collisions, the Dragon-Tiger Ruyi Scepter was sent flying again and again, only to return each time. Meanwhile, faint yellow specks of light began to emerge from Qin Wuliang’s palm—tiny, scattered motes resembling dust.

“Th-this… This is the Primordial Five Elements Earth Thunder! You… Ah—” The blue-robed giant’s body flashed with azure light as he attempted to flee, but it was already too late.

“**Explode.**”

The yellow specks flickered, contracted, then erupted instantaneously. Earthen-yellow lightning infused with pure earth-elemental energy detonated violently. As the clouds of dust dispersed, the blue-robed giant reappeared, his figure battered and his face twisted with fury.

At that moment, Qin Wuliang revealed another cluster of yellow sparks in his palm. In an instant, they surrounded the blue-robed giant. Qin smiled at him, his gaze lethally sharp, as if waiting to see the man’s choice. In truth, this giant was not Qin’s only option.

“Wait! I submit!” The blue-robed giant paled upon seeing the yellow specks, cursing inwardly. *Where did this Qin Wuliang come from? The Primordial Five Elements Earth Thunder is a Nascent Soul-stage lightning art, long lost to time! To wield it so effortlessly, even consecutively… Is this man a ghost or a god?*

“Then wear this. Rest assured, our Demon-Subduing Sect will treat you well.” Qin tossed out a bracelet before standing silently beside Guan Yu.

“The nuisance is resolved, yet the host still refuses to show themselves. The Penglai Pavilion truly lacks hospitality. Must I dismantle your mountain gate before you emerge?” Guan Yu’s murmur carried the force of thunder to the cultivators’ ears.

“Ah… Sect Master Guan’s presence honors our humble sect! We failed to greet you properly. May we inquire about your purpose here?” A gaunt, withered elder materialized before the mountain gate, his expression bitter. Clearly, he hadn’t expected the blue-robed giant to lose—and so decisively.

“Enough talk. I want Ren Yisha’s head. Hand him over, and this ends here. Refuse, and I’ll take it myself.” Guan Yu’s lips curled with domineering arrogance.

“Sect Master Guan… isn’t this excessive? My disciple has done nothing to—” The elder tried to argue, but Guan Yu cut him off.

“Island Master of Penglai, correct? I dislike wasting words. Whether he’s wronged me is clear to all. If you insist on quibbling, I’ll act myself.” Guan Yu’s tone brooked no compromise. At his words, the blue-robed giant and Qin Wuliang stepped forward, their oppressive auras deepening the elder’s despair.

“Guan Yu! Do not push us too far! I, Ren—”

A mid-Nascent Soul stage cultivator had barely appeared when Qin Wuliang immobilized him. The man—who had intended to self-destruct beside Guan Yu—froze in stunned paralysis.

“Admirable courage. Pity I leave no loose ends.” Purple light flashed in Guan Yu’s hand. Ren Yisha, the Penglai Island’s head disciple, fell headless. A tiny purple Nascent Soul floated from his corpse, only to be crushed by Guan Yu’s grip, dispersing into spiritual energy.

“He’s dead. I suggest you act wisely, Island Master. Disciples can be replaced. If you foolishly resist, I’ll slaughter every soul on this island. After all, killing is killing. Agreed?” Guan Yu licked his lips with a blood-red tongue, as if hoping for defiance. But the Island Master, though ashen-faced, showed no dissent—whether from fear or helplessness, he accepted this reality.

“Guan Yu… So long as you remain powerful, all is well. But should you ever falter…” The elder shook his head, dispelling some nameless hope. His spirit seemed to wither as he turned and vanished into the mountain gate, his back aged in an instant.

Returning to the small boat ashore, Guan Yu channeled his qi, bringing the subdued blue-robed giant and releasing Old Xue. The trio boarded an oceanic vessel waiting nearby.

“Matters concluded, we may rest. Your name? Your true form is a blue whale, correct? Though only at the early Tribulation Transcendence stage, your combat power at sea rivals early Mahayana cultivators.” Aboard the ship, Guan Yu relaxed fully.

The Penglai Island Master, as rumored, was indeed a pushover. His mid-Tribulation Transcendence cultivation, while respectable, paled against his timid, unprincipled nature—a “turtle” who eroded Penglai’s prestige through endless concessions.

“Whale San pays respects to Sect Master Uncle.” The blue-robed giant bowed reluctantly. Though妖族 revered strength, he adhered to human sect etiquette.

“Do you have a grotto-heaven? With the spiritual energy resurgence, have any ruins emerged in these outer seas?” Having subdued this demon, Guan Yu wouldn’t overlook his assets.

“I possess a grotto, but carry my valuables. Unlike others, I rule no territory. That elder lured me here, else… Despite the energy resurgence, the Eastern Sea remains quiet—no ruins.” Whale San’s resentment at becoming a human’s servant was palpable, yet the control bracelet stifled his complaints.

“Seal your grotto and return. If the East Sea offers nothing, we’ll seek opportunities among the demonic sects.” After a pause, Guan Yu dialed a satellite phone.

“Guan Yu? To think you’d call. What do you want?” A lazily surprised voice answered.

“Yin Qianji, does the demonic sect have plans—or known but unexplored ruins?” Guan Yu cut to the chase.

“We possess a demonic ruin map. Interested?” Yin Qianji’s tone relaxed. From ancient times to this age of dwindling dao, countless ruins remained—demonic sects held many.

“Your location? When can I get it? What’s your price?”

“Ninghai. Come retrieve it. As for payment… Should you enter a ruin, much loot will be unusable to you. Sell it to me.” Yin Qianji hesitated slightly. Whatever Guan Yu sought, profits would be vast—worth the trade.

“Deal. But I want Five Elements Essences—the more, the better. Contact in Ninghai.” Guan Yu hung up, meditating. He needed Qin’s counsel—which demonic ruin to target?

Yin Qianji, meanwhile, frowned. Though allied with Guan Yu, recklessness was unwise. He entered his study, bowed thrice before a formation, and dripped blood onto it. A shadowy figure materialized—a cold-faced youth in black robes.

“Grandson greets the Ancestral Patriarch.” Yin Qianji’s address betrayed the youth’s true age—the尹 Clan’s patriarch and strongest cultivator.

“News of Guan Yu?” The youth’s expressionless face radiated pressure, silencing the world through the formation.

“Yes. He requested demonic ruin intel. I agreed, proposing we trade unusable relics. Should we leak this?”

“Noted. Maintain ties. That boy… is no simpleton.” The image vanished. Though brief, Yin Qianji’s back dripped with sweat.

Three days later, Guan Yu stared at a densely annotated demonic ruin map, overwhelmed.

“Elder Qin, choose a ruin most likely to yield Scarlet Flame Blood Mushrooms—one we can enter.” Such tasks suited experts. Guan Yu had greater preparations.

“Boss, Minister Xiao Xiao seeks you.” Lin Dong’s voice echoed outside.

“Have her wait in the parlor.” Guan Yu paused. Without word from Leopard, this wasn’t Long Aotian’s doing. A personal matter for the beautiful minister?

“Vampires in our country? You’re certain it’s not the Blood Coagulation Demon Sect?” Guan Yu stared at phone footage, baffled.

“We inquired through demonic channels. It’s neither them nor any known sect. Only vampires drain blood entirely, leaving desiccated corpses. And… we captured this.” Xiao Xiao grimaced. Such incidents in her jurisdiction threatened her career.

**Chapter 2006: Invasion Plan (Cont.)**

“Are these vampires suicidal?” Guan Yu watched a handsome, elegantly dressed vampire stick out a crimson tongue, mockingly cross-eyed, then flip off the camera before static consumed the feed. He felt not anger, but amusement—as if watching clowns.

“Even at our weakest, foreigners dared not act so brazenly. Should we treat this as a diplomatic incident?” Xiao Xiao frowned, uncertain.

“How amusing. If Minister Xiao permits, let me handle this.” Guan Yu’s lazy smile reeked of bloodlust.

That night, Ninghai’s bustling bar district. A golden-haired foreigner passionately kissed a scantily clad girl in a back alley. Her moans crescendoed until his azure eyes flashed crimson. Fangs extended toward her neck—but the girl vanished in a blur.

“Little bat, whatever brought you here… you *must* die.”

*Bang!* The youth dissolved into a swarm of bats, scattering.

“Treacherous Easterner! Your filthy land awaits our Blood Clan’s purge! Ha—*ahh!*”

A blue net erupted, ensnaring every bat. Lightning crackled across its threads, vaporizing the swarm until one struggling bat remained.

“Did I permit your departure?” Guan Yu materialized calmly. A blue-robed giant (Whale San) controlled the net, while a crimson-haired man (Old Xue) observed with interest.

“Evil Orien—”

“Manners, please. Old Xue, he’s yours. Extract his aura. Whale San will accompany you to Ninghai—eradicate every vampire linked to him. How long?”

Old Xue’s laughter dripped hunger. “Three days. None shall remain.”

“Ensure these foreigners learn: here, *our* rules reign.” Guan Yu departed, leaving Whale San and Old Xue chilled by his parting grin.

Three days later, the Thirteen Vampire Clans’ headquarters received a dossier from Dragon Group. Images chilled the thirteen Princes and one Emperor seated at their round table.

“Your thoughts?” The Emperor’s gravelly voice held imperious weight.

“This insults our glorious Blood Clan! War! Have these Eastern fools forgotten past humiliations?” A hawkish Prince roared, but none joined him.

“Send Viscount Velen. We shall… *communicate* with this rising Eastern force.” The Emperor’s tone allowed no dissent.

Five days later, a pale, well-dressed youth stared coldly at Guan Yu’s villa, crimson glinting in his eyes.

At midnight, the youth—cloaked—drifted into the villa unimpeded.

“Hmm… Prime blood arrives!” Old Xue’s chuckle saturated the air.

“N-no! I am the Blood Clan’s envoy—”

“Envoys don’t skulk at midnight. Let’s test your ‘credentials.’” A crimson blur clashed with the vampire’s black dagger, their speeds matched.

Hidden, Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. *This “Velen” rivals Old Xue’s suppressed speed? The Blood Clan has talent.*

“You’re in *my* domain. Obey my rules… or perish.”

Guan Yu’s Gravity Domain activated. Velen crumpled mid-air. Old Xue shattered his bones with a palm strike. Even vampiric regeneration left him a crippled heap.

“Remember this lesson: here, *we* rule.”
