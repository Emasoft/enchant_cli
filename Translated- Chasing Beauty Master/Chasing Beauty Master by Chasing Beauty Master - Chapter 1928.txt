The events that had just transpired revealed a stark contrast in Qiqi’s capabilities after obtaining the Fairy Sword. The unremarkable earthen-yellow gem embedded in the sword’s hilt undoubtedly amplified its power. With a single strike, Qiqi cleaved through an entire tree, the residual force leaving a deep scar on a distant wall.

The difference between her two demonstrations was staggering. Guan Yu surmised that while wielding a branch, Qiqi’s strength barely qualified as Third-Class Mastery. But with the Fairy Sword, her prowess soared to at least Second-Class Upper Tier—if not First-Class. Such was the transformative power of a divine artifact.

“Astounding! The Fairy Sword’s might has reshaped my understanding,” Jiang Yuankai remarked in awe.

Qiqi bounded over, her face alight with joy. “This sword is incredible! Did you see how much stronger I was?”

“We saw,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. “It’s yours now. Guard it well.”

“I will!” she promised.

Jiang Yuankai cautioned, “Though few in the jianghu might recognize this blade, its fame invites danger. Qiqi is still young and vulnerable. To avoid trouble, she should conceal it during travel.”

Guan Yu nodded. Displaying the sword recklessly could invite unwanted attention. Once Qiqi’s skills matured, few would dare challenge her. For now, discretion was wise. “I’ll procure a beast-hide scabbard. Carry it hidden on your back, and draw it only when necessary.”

“I’ll follow your advice,” Qiqi agreed, aware of the risks. The sword’s power had elevated her confidence, making her feel like a seasoned warrior. Even Jiang Yuankai’s admiration bolstered her resolve.

By evening, Duan Ruxue awoke, stubbornly refusing her maids’ assistance. “Fetch Brother Wan!” she insisted, distrustful of others while her eyes remained bandaged.

Guan Yu obliged, instructing, “Close your eyes. Once I remove the cloth, extinguish the candles to shield her from bright light.” Though the bandages could wait until morning, he wanted to assess her recovery. If needed, he would expend spiritual energy to heal her—a costly but necessary measure. The sooner she recovered, the sooner they could depart.

Inspecting her, he noted the bruises around her eyes had faded, though slight swelling persisted. After the maids dimmed the room, he urged, “Open your eyes slowly. Test your vision.”

Duan Ruxue obeyed, blinking as moonlight illuminated the chamber. “I can see! My eyes aren’t blind!” She seized Guan Yu’s hand joyfully before ordering her maids, “Prepare food! I’m starving!”

“Your left eye may still feel tender from the swelling,” Guan Yu advised. “Rest with your eyes closed tonight. By dawn, you’ll fully recover.”

“Thank you, Brother Wan. I owe you my sight.”

“Rest well,” he said, departing after instructing the maids to remove all mirrors. Her swollen eyelid would distress her, and he aimed to spare her vanity until morning.

At dawn, Guan Yu confirmed Duan Ruxue’s improvement and declared their departure. With Xiao Wu’s return after escorting the Grassland Eleven back to prison, the group set out.

Jiang Yuankai consulted a map. “If we press onward today, we’ll reach the northern region by nightfall. The black hole is rumored to lie in a remote forest there, though its exact location requires local inquiry.”

“Weren’t the northern villagers evacuated?” Guan Yu asked.

“The authorities are trying,” Jiang Yuankai replied. “But relocating an entire populace takes time. Some resist abandoning their homes and livelihoods.”

***Chapter 5067: Joining the Journey***

The evacuation’s complexity stemmed from fear and attachment. While soldiers guarded the black hole, their presence offered little protection against the monstrous threat. Guan Yu acknowledged the government’s effort, though sending troops into such danger was grimly pragmatic.

“Let’s endure today’s haste and reach the north swiftly,” Guan Yu decided.

By day’s end, they arrived in the crowded northern town, swollen with refugees. Duan Ruxue, exhausted from the journey, demanded lodging. Despite inflated prices, Guan Yu secured six rooms at triple the cost—600 taels—to appease her.

After a guarded meal, Jiang Yuankai slipped away unnoticed. Though Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi wished to explore, Guan Yu forbade it, citing the chaotic streets. Rest was paramount for the next day’s peril.

***Chapter 5068: Stay Calm***

At dawn, Jiang Yuankai proposed, “I’ve located the black hole. Guan Yu and I will lead a team. The women should remain here.”

“We go where Brother Wan goes!” Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi insisted.

Guan Yu relented, wary of leaving them vulnerable. “Prepare for hardship. You’ll lodge in military camps, not inns.”

Qiqi, eager to test her Fairy Sword against monsters, agreed readily. Wang Xiaorong refused separation, and Duan Ruxue, despite her reluctance, joined rather than risk staying behind.

Guided by Jiang Yuankai, they ascended a mountain where hundreds of soldiers encircled a cavernous pit. The men stood resolute, knowing desertion meant execution, yet nightly disappearances hinted at the horror within.

A centurion greeted Jiang Yuankai with deference. “Imperial Son-in-Law Jiang, your reputation precedes you. When will you confront the abyss?”

“After gathering witnesses,” Jiang Yuankai replied. “Summon all who’ve seen the creature.”

Guan Yu surveyed the terrain—a valley scarred by storms, the five-meter-wide chasm gaping between hills. Beyond lay a flood-ravaged town, its evacuation incomplete. Soldiers here served as grim sentinels, sacrificing themselves to protect civilians.

In a command tent, Jiang Yuankai strategized, while Guan Yu contemplated the abyss. The task ahead loomed dire, but with the Fairy Sword’s might and united resolve, they dared to challenge the darkness.
