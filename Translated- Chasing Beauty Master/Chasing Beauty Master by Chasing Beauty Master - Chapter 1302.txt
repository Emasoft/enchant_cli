“Alright, let’s book three adjacent rooms,” Guan Yu said. “That way, if anything happens, we can easily look out for each other.”

No one else objected. Just then, a woman nearby called out, “Waiter! Get me a spacious upper-class room!”

The inn attendant took one look at the newcomer and immediately sensed she was trouble. Bowing obsequiously, he grinned, “Right away, Miss! Please head upstairs—you can pick any room you fancy!”

Guan Yu glanced at the woman. She wore a sleek black martial outfit that accentuated her lively demeanor, a red sash tied around her waist, and her hair pulled into a high ponytail secured with a crimson headband. Her bangs swept neatly across her forehead, framing a mischievously charming face.

Though she appeared no older than seventeen or eighteen, her entire aura radiated playful cunning. She bounced as she walked, which might have led strangers to mistakenly assume she had a limp.

As the attendant ushered her upstairs, Guan Yu observed her keenly. Xiao Zhi shook his head and sighed, “What a pity—such a pretty girl, yet crippled.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. The girl’s energetic gait clearly stemmed from vivacity, not disability. Couldn’t Xiao Zhi keep his thoughts to himself? The woman hadn’t even reached the stairs yet—and now she’d heard him.

The black-clad girl whirled around, glaring at Xiao Zhi. “Who are you calling a cripple?” she snapped. “Keep spouting nonsense, and I’ll gouge your eyes out!”

Xiao Zhi blinked, taken aback by the petite girl’s fiery temper. Her striking beauty and spirited attire matched her bold personality perfectly. Though embarrassed at being caught gossiping, he couldn’t help but see an opportunity. Their mission didn’t forbid making romantic connections, and since Siqi was clearly Guan Yu’s interest, this spitfire might be worth pursuing.

Guan Yu inwardly groaned. Women like her were walking trouble—reasonable arguments crumbled before their whims. Best to avoid entanglements.

“Sharp ears on that one,” Xiao Zhi muttered. “Heard me from halfway across the room.”

“You!” The girl stormed toward him, rage blazing. “Apologize now, or you’ll regret it!”

Guan Yu sighed. Why did Xiao Zhi always provoke the worst people?

“Apologize for what?” Xiao Zhi retorted, chin raised. “I didn’t name anyone. Since when is speaking a crime?”

The girl planted her red-shoed foot on his stool, leaning close until their faces nearly touched. “Last chance,” she hissed. “Apologize, or suffer the consequences.”

Xiao Zhi forced a smile. “No need for temper, beauty. How about I treat you to dinner as peace offering?”

Her anger visibly dimmed at the mention of free food. Scanning the table, her bright eyes lingered on Guan Yu. “Well now,” she smirked, “handsome men and pretty ladies all together? How novel. Earlier I saw a beauty getting bullied, and now here’s more eye candy.”

“Oh, you flatter me,” Xiao Zhi preened, mistaking her compliment.

“Pah! You’re delusional!” She spat in his face. “The handsome one is him, not you! Even the fishermen in town are better looking. Go crawl back to your mother’s womb for a remake!”

Xiao Zhi gaped. Never in his privileged life as an Elder’s son in the Cloud Azure Sect had anyone dared insult him so brazenly. The muffled snickers around the table twisted the knife deeper—especially with Siqi present.

“Enough!” Xiao Zhi barked at the giggling women before turning to the girl. “Your taste is clearly defective, but I’ll excuse your childishness. Run along now.”

The girl’s eyes narrowed. “Apologize, you ugly toad, or I’ll make you regret being born!”

Guan Yu bit back laughter. She’d upgraded Xiao Zhi from “cripple” to “toad” in seconds—impressive creativity.

As tensions escalated, Guan Yu intervened: “Miss, my friend spoke out of turn. Let’s settle this peacefully. Join us for a meal?”

The girl plopped into Xiao Zhi’s vacated seat, studying Guan Yu. “Name?”

“Guan Yu. ‘Guan’ as in connection, ‘Yu’ as in spirit.”

“Boring name,” she declared, “but you’re interesting. I’m Wang Xiaorong—call me Xiaorong.”

“A lovely name for a lovely lady,” Guan Yu charm. The forced compliment made Siqi and Xiaotong exchange disgusted looks.

“Enough!” Xiaotong stood abruptly. “I’m retiring. This nauseating chatter ruins appetites.”

Xiaorong smirked. “What’s wrong, frogface? That veil hiding warts?”

“You—!” Xiaotong’s hands flew into spellcasting gestures until Siqi’s stern look halted her.

As the innkeeper nervously approached about room assignments, Xiaorong deliberately demanded the central room Guan Yu’s group had booked. When refused, she offered double payment, forcing them to scatter accommodations.

“Can’t handle sleeping apart?” Xiaorong taunted. “Afraid of bogeymen?”

“We’re guarding against pests,” Xiaotong shot back. “Especially loud, troublemaking ones.”

Their spat reignited until Guan Yu separated them. Through gritted teeth, he entertained Xiaorong’s whims, enduring her flirtatious drinking games while others retreated. The night promised endless headaches—and this was only the beginning.
