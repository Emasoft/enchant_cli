“Hmm? Who’s trying to kill me?” Feng Xin (Joyous Phoenix) scowled, glaring at Guan Yu (Cosmic Pass).

“It’s a metaphor… *rape* and *murder*! Understand? Women who drink are easy targets for trouble!” Guan Yu snapped irritably, shooting her a sidelong glance. This tomboyish woman was utterly exasperating!

“But you’re right here with me…” A faint glimmer of amusement flickered in Feng Xin’s eyes as she tilted her head, studying Guan Yu’s glasses.

“That doesn’t mean you should drink this much!” Guan Yu retorted, his tone sharp.

“Oh… fine, I’ll stop!” To his surprise, Feng Xin pouted her lips, sulkily setting down the bottle. She slumped listlessly into her chair, adopting the pitiful air of a bullied young bride—utterly dejected, as if she’d truly given up drinking.

*Damn, this woman’s hopeless!* Guan Yu scratched his forehead helplessly under the accusatory glares of his three brothers. *Hell, they’re acting like I’m tormenting her! Can’t they see she’s faking it? As if I could ever boss her around—what a joke!*

As they chatted, three minivans screeched to a halt outside the restaurant. Doors flew open, and over twenty thugs in their thirties poured out, brandishing steel pipes, wooden clubs, and machetes as they charged toward the entrance.

“Hmm?” Feng Xin, who had been idly shredding a napkin, suddenly stiffened. Her gaze turned icy as she assessed the mob outside, poised to rise.

“Stay seated. This isn’t your fight—they’re here for us,” Guan Yu said calmly, pressing a hand on her arm.

*She’s had too much to drink. Even if she’s skilled, with this many armed thugs… I can’t risk her getting hurt while I’m distracted.*

**Chapter 102: Afraid I’ll Sell You Off?**

Feng Xin blinked at Guan Yu, baffled. “You… caused trouble again?”

“Those bastards skipped out on their bill. We taught them a lesson. No big deal,” Guan Yu replied casually, his eyes locked on the incoming crowd.

In unison, the four friends snatched beer bottles from the table and surged forward to meet the attackers.

Guan Yu felt confident. With his Gravity Manipulation Technique active, he could knock out one foe per punch. Combined with the Bone Fracture Fist techniques learned from Old Master Feng, he’d halve their numbers in thirty seconds. His brothers just needed to hold out until then.

Nervousness prickled his spine—these men carried blades and clubs. A single misstep meant bloodshed.

*Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!* Four bottles shattered against skulls. The first four thugs froze, eyes bulging as if petrified, oblivious to the blood streaming down their faces.

“Sister Xin… what are you doing here?” A bald man stammered, wiping blood from his eyelid. He hunched nervously, eyeing Guan Yu’s group.

“Hmm? Just having dinner with my boyfriend. What’s this? Planning to start a fight? Need help?”

“N-no! We’ll leave right now!” The bald man’s face paled. *The Fire Gang’s Big Sister’s boyfriend?! That crippled fool Li picked a fight with* her *man? He’s got a death wish!*

“Wait. Come here—I have questions.” Feng Xin wiped her hands with a napkin and beckoned coolly.

“Y-yes, Sister!” The bald man scuttled forward, ignoring his bleeding face. His underlings fell silent, heads bowed.

“Who’s seeking revenge? Point out the one who skipped the bill.” Her voice remained calm, but sweat dripped down the bald man’s neck.

“I-I don’t know who didn’t pay! Li the Cripple—my buddy—said he got beaten here. We just came to… clear up the misunderstanding!”

“Misunderstanding? Bring Li the Cripple here.” Feng Xin spun her teacup lazily, her gaze piercing the crowd.

Li the Cripple, bandaged and smeared with antiseptic, shrank backward.

“You deaf?! Sister Xin called you!” the bald man barked.

“H-here, Sister!” Li hobbled forward, trembling under Guan Yu’s cold stare.

“You skipped payment? Which mouth dared eat for free?” Feng Xin’s tone sharpened.

“I’ll pay! It was a mistake—a misunderstanding!” Li’s spine chilled. *The Fire Gang’s untouchable! How did I step on this landmine?*

“Good. This restaurant belongs to a younger brother of mine. Remember that next time.” She turned to Guan Yu. “Your call. How to handle them?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Up to you. We already taught them manners. If they want round two, we’ll oblige.” He smirked, sensing the fight had fizzled.

Niu Le (Happy Ox) brandished a machete, eager for action.

“Enough. If it’s settled, scram.”

“Th-thank you, Sister Xin!” The bald man bowed repeatedly, herding his men into a hasty retreat.

Tian Hao (Vast Field) and Wang Zhen (Vibrant King) gaped at Feng Xin. *Who* is *this ice queen, commanding gangs with a word?*

Feng Xin sipped her tea, eyeing Guan Yu. “Why didn’t you call me? What if I hadn’t been here?”

“They’d have fled after a few hits. Cowards don’t fight to the death.”

“Always so confident. Next time, *tell me*.”

Guan Yu nodded wryly. *I’m supposed to be* her *bodyguard, yet she’s protecting* us.

Tian Hao and Wang Zhen exchanged glances—this woman radiated power.

After farewells, Guan Yu slid into Feng Xin’s car, clutching her shopping bags.

“Where to?”

“Asking questions? Afraid I’ll sell you off?” She stared impassively.

“N-no!”

“To my place. Train with Grandpa this afternoon. Evening event—you’re my escort.”

“Uh… sure.”

**Chapter 103: All Talk**

Feng Xin drove to Diyaya Entertainment City. Guan Yu trailed her, impressed by the staff’s deference. *A woman running multiple venues with gang ties—no easy feat.*

Her office remained unchanged, save for a missing vase.

“Grandpa asked me to give you this.” She handed him a yellowed manual. “The Bone Fracture Fist’s Thirty-Six Forms—three techniques per form. Practice at my home if needed.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. The unassuming booklet contained the Feng family’s secret legacy! Without Old Master Feng’s guidance, the plain illustrations seemed mundane—yet with precision and his Gravity Manipulation, they became deadly.

He immersed himself in the diagrams, oblivious to Feng Xin’s occasional glances.

*Is this fool seriously ignoring me for scribbles?* She huffed, massaging her stiff neck.

“Neck sore?”

“Old desk-job problem.”

“Stretch regularly.”

“I know,” she muttered, rolling her shoulders futilely.

“Let me massage it.”

“No!”

“I’m trained—instant relief!” *Lie. But the Healing Technique’s warmth should help.*

Relenting, Feng Xin sipped coffee as Guan Yu’s hands channeled golden energy from his mind’s copper coin.

“Huh… it’s warm. You *do* know your stuff.”

“Of course! I could cure cancer, probably.”

“*Really?!*”

“Uh… theoretically. Haven’t tried.”

“Ugh. All talk.”

**Chapter 104: Ice Queen**

A knock interrupted. A suited man entered. “Sister Xin, tonight’s meeting with Da Jun—bring backup?”

“Just him.” She nodded at Guan Yu.

The man blinked. *The kid who held her hostage?!*

“Get him proper clothes.”

“Yes, Sister!”

Feng Xin resumed work, ignoring Guan Yu’s absorbed study. *Men and their martial obsessions…*
