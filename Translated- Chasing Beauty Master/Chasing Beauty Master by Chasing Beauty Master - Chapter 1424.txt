“Why have you returned alone? Didn’t the officials come with you?” The proprietress asked curiously, observing the man. This was the first time such a thing had happened.

The proprietress smiled and said, “Oh, I see. You must have ridden ahead on horseback while the officials’ soldiers follow shortly, correct?”

The man shook his head. “No, madam. Something grave has occurred—a major incident at the magistrate’s office.”

“What exactly happened? Speak!” the proprietress pressed urgently. It seemed Guan Yu’s prediction had come true.

“When I arrived at the magistrate’s office, chaos reigned. Everyone was frantically gathering. After much difficulty, I found someone who recognized me and learned Magistrate Zhou is gravely ill and bedridden—likely beyond recovery.”

“What nonsense!” The proprietress roared in fury, her anger unquenched by mere words. She slapped the messenger squarely across the face.

The blow struck his ear, sending him spinning to the ground. His head buzzed, vision swimming as he collapsed in a daze.

Ignoring him, the proprietress stood frozen, disbelief etched on her face. “Magistrate Zhou bedridden... beyond recovery...” The words echoed relentlessly in her mind, unwelcome yet persistent.

She then recalled Guan Yu’s words—his prediction of calamity at the magistrate’s office today. Could he have known Magistrate Zhou’s life hung in the balance? Impossible! Her thoughts raced. Magistrate Zhou had always been robust. Just last month, during their... nocturnal liaison, he’d shown no signs of frailty. Though age had diminished certain... capabilities, his health remained sound. How could he suddenly succumb?

Even if ill, capable physicians should remedy it. Why this talk of impending death? After a prolonged silence, she wheeled on Guan Yu. “You! You must have orchestrated this! Magistrate Zhou was perfectly healthy—why would he collapse today unless you conspired against him?”

Guan Yu raised his hands placatingly. “You mistake me. I’ve never set foot in the magistrate’s office. How could I influence his health?”

“Then how did you foresee today’s disaster? Don’t play the fool with me!”

“Merely conjecture. I’ve been detained here nearly two hours—hardly time to scheme against a magistrate. Absurd! Do I possess the art of cloning?” Guan Yu retorted, exasperated.

He’d expected Yue Gao might face suspicion at the magistrate’s office, never imagining the blame would reach him across this distance.

Chapter 3701: Preparations for Departure

As the proprietress prepared another tirade, an elderly man restrained her. “Madam, the situation remains unclear. We must hasten to the magistrate’s office. Magistrate Zhou is your brother-in-law—if tragedy strikes, you should be present. Settle accounts with this youth later; he won’t escape.”

Reluctantly agreeing, the proprietress glared at Guan Yu. “Stay in this city, and you remain within my grasp. Flee, and I’ll drag you back!”

Turning to her subordinate, she barked, “Long-Face! Fetch the finest physician and bring them to the magistrate’s office.” She then pointed accusingly at Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong. “You two—stay put! Deal with you later. Leave this town, and I’ll hunt you down wherever you hide.”

With surprising agility, her bulky frame mounted a horse that whinnied protest under her weight. Guan Yu watched impassively, more concerned for Yue Gao than her threats. “Xiaorong, let’s return. We won’t procure a carriage today—best check on Yan Zhao.”

Wang Xiaorong seethed, unaccustomed to such humiliation. Only Guan Yu’s restraint prevented retaliation. Though mischievous in the Demonic Soul Sect under her father’s protection, here she must conceal her identity. Involving sect members risked exposure to the Cloud Azure Sect—a complication Guan Yu couldn’t afford.

“Still no word from Yue Gao,” Guan Yu mused that evening at the inn.

“Why concern ourselves?” Wang Xiaorong countered. “We barely know him. With Magistrate Zhou poisoned, matters won’t resolve easily. Let’s depart tomorrow.”

At dawn, Yan Zhao arrived early. “Guan Yu, we must hasten. The sect inquires about our delayed progress—Master grows impatient.”

Nodding, Guan Yu abandoned plans to inquire after Yue Gao. “Prepare to depart.”

Though sensing Guan Yu’s lingering concern, Wang Xiaorong relented. Truthfully, Yue Gao hardly qualified as a friend. Their party mounted camels, the desired carriage unobtained until the next town.

***

The journey ahead required a full day’s travel by slow-moving camel—necessary for desert traversal. After the next town lay a day-night trek into true desert hardship.

Riding abreast, Guan Yu asked Wang Xiaorong, “Any word from the Demonic Soul Sect? Progress from Left Envoy and Steward Sun?”

“Uncertain. I dismissed my attendants to journey with you. Only Father can send messengers now.”

“Why such secrecy? Your sect members could shadow us discreetly.”

Wang Xiaorong grinned. “You’d detect any followers. Does the Cloud Azure Sect have spies trailing us?”

Guan Yu nodded—likely Master Xuanming’s precaution. Tracking would prove difficult in desert terrain.

“If Left Envoy returned to the sect,” Guan Yu mused, “they’ve located Miao City. We’d merely tour the desert then.”

“Our sect’s achievement,” Wang Xiaorong teased. “Father won’t let me share intel with Cloud Azure.”

“Relevant to me regardless,” Guan Yu countered. “Finding Miao City without Steward Sun’s fox-demon methods is hopeless. Endless desert wandering otherwise.”

He secretly hoped the sect’s success might spare him this ordeal. Otherwise, the Cloud Azure Sect might demand continuous search until the July 15 deadline. Failure to obtain the Eight-Sided Drum’s second volume meant disgrace—perhaps enforced seclusion for cultivation.

Yan Zhao harbored different plans. Colluding with Elder Xiang, their rendezvous point awaited at Shu Town. Luring Guan Yu into desert ambush, hired killers would strike while Yan Zhao remained clean.

Chapter 3703: Destitute

Observing a menagerie seller, Guan Yu noted the man’s improbable capture of tigers and pythons. Most townsfolk couldn’t afford such dangerous pets.

The bustling main street led them to an ostentatious inn—the “Handsome Men & Fair Maidens Inn.” Its avant-garde name intrigued Guan Yu, as did the signage:

Left Plaque:
First-Class Suites: 500 taels/night
Second-Class VIP Rooms: 300 taels
Third-Class: 150 taels
Hourly Specials: 50 taels/2 hours

Right Plaque:
Membership Benefits:
10% Discount + 5 Free Hourly Rooms

“Let’s lodge here,” Guan Yu proposed.

Wang Xiaorong agreed, “Lavish but comfortable.”

Yan Zhao balked. “Extravagant! Common inns charge 30 taels. You two stay—I’ll find cheaper quarters.”

“Embarrassing the sect over pennies?” Guan Yu chided. “I’ll cover your third-class room. Meals excluded.”

Eagerly accepting, Yan Zhao entered first. The courtyard hosted red-gowned hostesses—an anomaly in male-dominated hospitality. While Wang Xiaorong questioned this breach of tradition, Guan Yu found it refreshingly modern.

As saltmarsh ogled the hostesses, Guan Yu noted his lecherous tendencies—particularly toward Wang Xiaorong. This required monitoring to prevent impropriety.

Chapter 3705: Breaking Conventions

Inside, Yan Zhao complained about third-class rooms’ poor location. “Fifty taels elsewhere buys better lodging and meals!”

Wang Xiaorong snapped, “The silver isn’t yours to reclaim! Stay or leave—we won’t chase you.”

The confrontation highlighted Yan Zhao’s growing resentment—and Guan Yu’s determination to protect his companion from unwanted advances.
