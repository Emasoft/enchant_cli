With a determined charge, Yan Zhao (Salt Marsh) plunged headlong into the enemy's sword formation, shielding Santou (Three Heads) through successive waves of attacks. Seizing this opportunity, Santou successfully escaped through Chen Gong's passage.

The white-haired elder initially gave chase but soon retreated to the mountain cave as the external temperatures began affecting him. His duty only extended to guarding the cave's entrance – matters beyond weren't his concern.

Limited by his physical capabilities and unprepared for their sudden deployment of the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Gu, the elder found himself severely restricted. Under normal circumstances, even Sun Lianzi wouldn't have fazed him.

Santou fled several li in mere moments. Glancing back at Yan Zhao trapped within the swirling blades, he could only hope for the man's survival. Reinforcements from the Scarlet Lotus Sect would likely arrive soon.

Yan Zhao's fate now depended on his own skill, with pursuers still tailing Santou. The latter eventually reached Scarlet Lotus Sect's foothills, finding temporary safety yet growing concerned about his companion. Despite their mutual dislike, Santou felt genuine gratitude – Yan Zhao's intervention had been crucial.

Returning would mean certain death. Rescuing Yan Zhao proved impossible now. "Live or die – that's your own battle," Santou muttered, continuing his retreat.

Within the sword formation, Yan Zhao calculated grimly. Failure meant disgrace before the Demon Lord, even if he survived. A botched first mission would render him worthless. His only path lay in gambling everything – retrieving the Myriad Phenomena Disk might redeem him through martyrdom or promotion.

The Scarlet Lotus sword formation shifted through cardinal directions, attackers materializing from all quarters. Yan Zhao's years as Yunqing Sect's head disciple served him well. Recognizing patterns in the lethal dance, he noted the observers' strange hesitation.

"Yunqing Sect dog!" barked the formation leader. "Stealing from Scarlet Lotus? When Xuanming learns of this..."

Yan Zhao laughed through gritted teeth. "You mistake friend for foe! I came for your patriarch's birthday. That escaped thief belongs to Demon Soul Sect – he's stolen your precious Disk while you waste time here!"

Panic rippled through the disciples. The Myriad Phenomena Disk – one of their sect's treasures! As half the force broke away in pursuit, Yan Zhao struck two crucial nodes. The formation collapsed like shattered glass.

"Let me aid your chase!" he shouted, summoning swordflight technique. Yunqing's aerial mobility soon outpaced ground-bound pursuers.

Meanwhile, Santou reached a foothill village. Disguised, he witnessed Scarlet Lotus search parties. To his astonishment, rumors spoke of Yan Zhao's escape.

By nightfall, both returned wounded to Demon Soul Sect. Yan Zhao bore a deep back wound, hastily bandaged. Before the Demon Lord's throne, Santou presented their prizes – the Fire Gu and glowing Disk.

"Your service pleases me," the crimson-robed ruler intoned. "Yan Zhao's dedication proves my trust well-placed. Though Yunqing cast you out, here you'll rise."

Yan Zhao bowed deeply. "This unworthy one thanks your mercy. Without Left Envoy's timely rescue..."

"Next time you trigger beast transformation without antidote nearby, you'll die screaming," the Left Envoy warned.

Santou finally understood Yan Zhao's escape – forced metamorphosis through blood poison. The Disk's acquisition came at cost: Wolf King now lay entombed within Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Lotus, its release mechanism bound to the stolen artifact.

"Scarlet Lotus tricksters!" the Demon Lord spat upon learning this. "Had we known the Disk controlled Wolf King's prison..."

Santou's suspicions of deception faded as the ruler's frustration proved genuine. "The Disk remains key," the Demon Lord concluded. "When you're ready to free Wolf King, it shall be yours."

Promotions followed. Yan Zhao became Left Altar's Fourth Hallmaster, basking in newfound status. His mind already plotted vengeance against Guan Yu – the Yunqing disciple who'd ruined him.

As celebrations commenced, the Demon Lord studied the Disk's intricate carvings. "With this, the Eight-Sided Drum Manual's second volume shall be mine," he murmured. Across the chamber, Yan Zhao's laughter rang hollow – a man trading past honor for future power, unaware of the poison slowly hardening his veins.

**Chapter 3934: Mission Accomplished**

The White-Haired Elder initially pursued but retreated to his cave as external temperatures affected him. Santou escaped to Scarlet Lotus foothills, eventually learning of Yan Zhao's improbable survival. Both returned wounded to Demon Soul Sect, presenting the Myriad Phenomena Disk and Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Gu.

**Chapter 3935: Strategic Utilization**

Though Wolf King's rescue failed, the Demon Lord celebrated the Disk's recovery – originally crafted by Ancestor Menghua. Yan Zhao's promotion to Hallmaster cemented his loyalty, while Santou bargained for future Disk access. The ruler concealed the artifact's connection to the Eight-Sided Drum Manual.

**Chapter 3936: Revelation**

As Yan Zhao reveled in his new position, the Demon Lord contemplated the Disk's true purpose – detecting the Manual's location. Unbeknownst to all, the artifact's activation had alerted distant observers. Somewhere in Miao City, a stone tablet began glowing...
