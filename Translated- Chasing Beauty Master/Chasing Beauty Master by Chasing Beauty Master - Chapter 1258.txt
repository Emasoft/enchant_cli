It was unexpected that Guan Yu, having arrived at the Yunqing Sect for such a short time, had already interacted so closely with Siqi. For over a decade, Xiao Zhi had never even flown alongside Siqi. This was truly infuriating.

Xiao Zhi put on a pitiful expression and asked, “Junior Brother Guan Yu, could you describe—in great detail—exactly how it felt to fly beside Siqi? I want to experience it too.”

Guan Yu chuckled wryly, amused by his antics. Tilting his head as if reminiscing, he replied, “Ah, that feeling... it was truly marvelous. The faint fragrance in the air was intoxicating, her flowing robes danced with the breeze, enchanting the soul, and her peerless beauty outshone even celestial maidens.”

“Wow, that’s incredible! I can almost feel it now! Junior Brother Guan Yu, I’m in awe—so envious of you!” Xiao Zhi lamented with a bitter laugh.

His exaggerated demeanor made Guan Yu and Aze burst into laughter. Observing Xiao Zhi’s antics, Guan Yu found him genuinely amusing. It was clear Xiao Zhi wore his heart on his sleeve—a man of true emotions, quick to reveal his thoughts without guile.

As Siqi’s devoted admirer, Xiao Zhi had harbored feelings for her over a decade. Though somewhat precocious, his affection was sincere. Yet despite his deep infatuation, upon hearing of Guan Yu’s encounters with Siqi, he displayed no jealousy or malice—only regret and melancholy.

This revealed Xiao Zhi’s magnanimous nature, a man of broad-minded integrity. Guan Yu thus deemed him worthy of deeper friendship.

Guan Yu consoled him, “It’s not as grand as I made it sound. I’ve only met Senior Sister Siqi a few times. Senior Brother Xiao Zhi, if pining for her all these years has worn you down, why not let go?”

Xiao Zhi sighed helplessly, “It’s not that simple. Merely catching a glimpse of her is arduous. Though I’ve ‘admired’ her for over a decade, the times I’ve actually seen her could be counted on both hands.”

Aze sat down, smirking. “You’re torturing yourself. Knowing how sought-after Siqi is, yet clinging to hope—isn’t this self-inflicted misery?”

“Heh, there’s something major you both don’t know.” Xiao Zhi suddenly grinned slyly, as if fortune had smiled upon him.

“What’s this mystery? Your grin’s unsettling,” Guan Yu and Aze asked simultaneously. Aze wore a look of disdain, anticipating nonsense.

Xiao Zhi declared triumphantly, “I’ve realized having a powerful father helps! He promised that if I reach the top four in the Six Peaks Assembly, he’ll propose marriage to the Convergence Peak on my behalf! Isn’t this wonderful news?”

“Pah! I thought it was something important,” Aze scoffed dismissively. “Your master’s support means little unless Siqi herself agrees. Otherwise, it’s futile.”

“Aze, must you be so negative? The Convergence Peak’s Matriarch Dai would surely respect my father’s standing!” Xiao Zhi retorted, annoyed.

Guan Yu nodded. “I agree. If Elder Zheng intervenes, Matriarch Dai would likely oblige. Once she consents, the path becomes smoother. Since Siqi’s never been courted before, and given Senior Brother Xiao Zhi’s admirable qualities, this might succeed.”

Knowing Xiao Zhi’s dismal evening—denied chicken legs and constantly ridiculed by Aze—Guan Yu chose to encourage him.

**Chapter 3234: As Difficult as Ascending to Heaven**

Aze sneered at Xiao Zhi. “Junior Brother Guan Yu, you overestimate him. Siqi isn’t so easily persuaded. You’re being naive.”

“Oh? Would Matriarch Dai truly refuse Elder Zheng’s request? She must grant some courtesy,” Guan Yu countered.

Aze explained, “Whether she obliges or not, history proves otherwise. Previously, Elder Xiang of Left Void Peak took his star disciple to propose to Siqi. Matriarch Dai stated she wouldn’t oppose if Siqi consented. But when they met, Siqi uttered six words: ‘Greetings. Impossible. Farewell.’ Then she left. This shows Siqi isn’t an ordinary maiden. Under Matriarch Dai’s tutelage, she focuses solely on cultivation, devoid of worldly distractions. For a man to enter her world? Harder than scaling heaven.”

“So ruthless?” Guan Yu feigned surprise, though he’d heard of Siqi’s aloofness from Ma Xiao.

“That’s not all,” Aze added.

“There’s more?”

“Have you heard of Senior Brother Chen Hong?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Briefly, though I’ve never met him. Having arrived recently, I’ve only heard others mention him.”

Personally, Guan Yu didn’t find Siqi cold. Through their recent interactions, though she never smiled, he sensed warmth beneath her reserve—a heat one gradually perceives. Public perception misjudged her, yet her rejection of suitors remained absolute.

Within Yunqing Sect, none could capture Siqi’s regard. Guan Yu had heard of Chen Hong—a prodigy under Xuan Ming’s tutelage, whose cultivation advanced rapidly. Towering in stature and looks, he was deemed the sect’s most dashing disciple, radiating charisma.

Many believed Chen Hong and Siqi were fated—the sect’s fairest beauty and handsomest hero. Yet Chen Hong’s arrogance surpassed even Siqi’s. Though Guan Yu hadn’t met him, fellow disciples often gossiped.

When Chen Hong encountered Siqi, instead of courting her, he ignored her, expecting her to approach. To everyone’s shock, Siqi didn’t spare him a glance. Later, Chen Hong derided her as “pretentious,” drawing criticism from male disciples. However, as Chen Hong enjoyed Xuan Ming’s favor and numerous followers, none dared confront him openly.

Aze recounted this tale to Guan Yu.

Guan Yu pretended curiosity. “So Senior Sister Siqi is truly icy. Even if rejecting someone, shouldn’t she decline gently?”

Xiao Zhi groaned, “Chen Hong’s perfection made him idolized—our sect’s paragon. Thankfully, he shows no interest in pursuing Siqi.”

Guan Yu patted Xiao Zhi’s shoulder. “Fate works mysteriously. Senior Brother, don’t lose heart. Though Elder Xiang failed, perhaps you’ll succeed. Elder Zheng might sway Siqi with words.”

Guan Yu offered encouragement out of pity. Though he himself admired Siqi, as she remained unattached, all had equal right to pursue her.

“Junior Brother Guan Yu, you’re far kinder than Aze, who constantly mocks me. Such a poor friend!” Xiao Zhi lamented.

Aze retorted, “Fool! I speak truth to wake you from delusion. Enough chatter—the rabbit’s nearly done!”

Xiao Zhi finally noticed the roasting aroma. Salivating, he jumped up, forgetting Siqi entirely. “I’m claiming the thighs! Don’t dare compete—ah, this fragrance!”

Guan Yu laughed. “I’m already full. The rabbit’s all yours.”

“Let’s feast!” Aze lifted the spit and planted it vertically. “Carving slices with knives tastes best.”

Xiao Zhi drooled onto his robes. “Enough talk—I’m eating!”

The duo devoured half the rabbit swiftly. Grease-faced, Xiao Zhi slumped contentedly. “I’m stuffed! Never tasted such delicious rabbit!”

**Chapter 3235: Sentiments**

Aze sat down. “Guan Yu, try some. Roast rabbit’s vastly different from chicken.”

“I’m truly full. Meeting you both tonight brought me joy.” Guan Yu spoke sincerely. Despite their quirks, Xiao Zhi and Aze’s genuine natures made them worthwhile companions.

Aze smiled. “You’re good company too. We’re glad to know you.”

“Heh, I’ll just say—thank Guan Yu for the rabbit!” Xiao Zhi declared, prompting shared laughter.

Afterward, Guan Yu proposed, “Let’s hunt here regularly. I’ll handle catching rabbits—they’re speedy but manageable.”

“Not soon,” Aze sighed. “The Six Peaks Assembly approaches.”

**Chapter 3236: Uncertain Prospects**

Guan Yu wondered—the Assembly typically involved elite disciples. While Xiao Zhi participated thanks to Elder Zheng’s magic tools, did Aze qualify too?

“Senior Brother Aze, are you joining? We might spar there.”

Xiao Zhi side-eyed Aze. “Despite his gluttonous appearance, Aze’s cultivation talent shines. He’s Father’s top disciple—of course he’s competing.”

“Impressive! My respects,” Guan Yu clasped hands.

Blushing at praise, Aze waved dismissively. “Don’t believe him! Xiao Zhi’s the one coasting on magic tools.”

“Hah! Blessed with a capable father!” Xiao Zhi boasted unashamedly.

Aze rolled eyes before asking Guan Yu, “You mentioned sparring—are you participating too?” Their doubtful looks questioned how a two-month novice could qualify.

Guan Yu nodded. “Master insists I’m ready.”

“You jest!” Xiao Zhi exclaimed. “I sense no spiritual energy in you! Why seek a beating?”

Unfazed, Guan Yu smiled. “If you rely on tools, so do I.” He produced the Diyin Seal. Following Xuan Ming’s plan to publicize its power, Guan Yu explained, “This enables my participation.”

The artifact awed them. Xiao Zhi gasped, “This... it’s near-immortal grade! Can it store spells?”

“Four spells,” Guan Yu confirmed.

“FOUR?!” they shrieked in disbelief.

“Senior Sister Siqi escorted me to the Ancestral Hall so Master Jiu could imbue it with advanced spells.”

“Diyin Seal?!” Xiao Zhi paled. “The legendary imperial relic? It’s among the mightiest magic tools—lacking only spiritual storage to become immortal-grade!”

“Exactly. The perfect cultivation aid,” Guan Yu affirmed.

“With this,” Xiao Zhi groaned, “who’d dare fight you? We’d forfeit instantly! Master Jiu’s spells could cripple us!”

Aze stared nervously. “How can we compete against that?”

Xiao Zhi lamented, “You’ve crushed my proposal hopes! I just needed top four!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Your father’s gifts may suffice. We might not even face each other.”

Aze suddenly asked, “Speaking of top four—what rewards await this year?”

Both looked expectantly. Guan Yu recalled, “Past champions received blessings from the Merit Cauldron, boosting cultivation. But this year...” He trailed off meaningfully.
