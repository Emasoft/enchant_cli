After hearing Wen Ming’s words, Siqi finally nodded in satisfaction. It was clear that Wen Ming possessed some courage and understood how to act under such circumstances—at least he hadn’t been scared witless like A Cai.

Seeing Wen Ming remain motionless, A Cai anxiously urged, “Wen Ming! Are you just going to stand here waiting to die? Why aren’t you running?” His fear was palpable.

However, Guanyu could see that A Cai, despite his terror, prioritized loyalty over self-preservation. Though terrified, he hadn’t fled alone but instead tried to drag his companion away, even pleading when Wen Ming refused to budge. This demonstrated A Cai’s deep sense of brotherhood, which Guanyu admired. In contrast, Wen Ming—though outwardly braver—struck Guanyu as foolish.

The two were clearly outmatched by the three adversaries. While the enemy seemed preoccupied with discussions, offering a chance to escape, Wen Ming chose to linger and spout meaningless threats. Stubbornly staying despite certain defeat wasn’t bravery—it was recklessness.

“I must drive these outsiders from Yunqing Sect’s territory or capture them for Master’s judgment. We cannot simply flee!” Wen Ming declared with inflated resolve.

A Cai stared at him as if he were an idiot, whispering urgently, “Are you out of your mind? We’re barely surviving here! That cane-wielder could crush us both. Why court death?”

Wen Ming, radiating self-righteous devotion, retorted, “Go back and inform Master. I’ll stall them here.” His reverence for Yunqing Sect bordered on religious fervor.

“Stop this madness!” A Cai hissed. “If I leave, you’ll die! Know your limits!” But Wen Ming’s rigid loyalty rendered him deaf to reason.

Meanwhile, one of the black-clad men hissed coldly to the cane-bearer, “Our meeting’s compromised. These Yunqing disciples must be silenced.”

The cane-wielder hesitated. Unleashing powerful magic here risked alerting experts meditating at Tiger’s Head Peak. Provoking Xuan Ming’s intervention would spell disaster. “Let them swear silence and spare their lives. Our mission takes priority,” he countered.

With a tap of his staff, its luminous pearl emitted a golden light that ensnared A Cai and Wen Ming in immobilizing bands. “We’re trapped!” A Cai panicked, struggling futilely. “Honored ones, we merely passed by! We heard nothing—spare us!”

Wen Ming, though restrained, maintained defiant composure. “Trespassing on Yunqing land violates our laws. As disciples, we must deliver you to our master!”

“You idiot!” A Cai spat. “Our necks are on the block, and you threaten them? Master would flay us for being here!”

“I’d rather die with honor than kneel to scum!” Wen Ming declared.

The cane-wielder smirked. “Kowtow three times, or lose a leg.”

A Cai readily complied. “Release me, and I’ll kneel!” As the restraints lifted, he dropped heavily, forehead thudding thrice against earth.

“Traitor!” Wen Ming roared. “A man kneels only to heaven and parents!”

“Better a live dog than a dead hero,” A Cai retorted bitterly before fleeing without backward glance.

Guanyu and Siqi observed hidden in brush. Both disciples’ choices held logic: A Cai’s pragmatism preserved life where strength failed; Wen Ming’s stubborn honor, though reckless, embodied sect loyalty.

Now alone, Wen Ming stood no chance. The cane-wielder reactivated his golden bonds, crushing pressure distorting the disciple’s frame. “Kneel, or become meat paste.”

As Wen Ming gritted against agony, Guanyu emerged casually. “Can’t a man sleep? What’s this midnight ruckus?”

The intruders startled—none had detected Guanyu’s presence. The cane-wielder eased his assault, studying the newcomer. Behind him, a stocky figure shrank back nervously.

“Just travelers,” Guanyu drawled, positioning himself strategically. “Though you’ve ruined my herb-gathering rest.” His modern sportswear confused them—clearly no sect disciple.

The cane-wielder masked wariness with false camaraderie. “Young friend, let’s discuss this civilly.” His guard, a martial expert, tensed forward.

Guanyu assessed the trio: two cultivators, one formidable bodyguard. Smirking inwardly, he prepared his gambit—this night’s drama was far from over.
