“Did I wrong her? I’m fortunate to have survived her palm strike at all,” Guan Yu retorted disdainfully.

Xuan Ming stepped before Guan Yu and spoke in a conciliatory tone, “Guan Yu, you have already kowtowed, offered tea, and formally acknowledged me as your master. Even if you haven’t begun learning spells, you are still my disciple. Today’s incident was Dai Shimei’s fault. I have punished her severely, and I will reprimand Ling Su upon returning. I’ve done all I can. Do you feel my efforts to keep you here are sufficient?”

Guan Yu could tell Xuan Ming’s words were sincere. The sect leader genuinely wished to retain him, hence the harsh punishment imposed on Convergence Peak.

Siqi suddenly knelt before Xuan Ming, her tear-streaked face pleading, “Disciple begs Sect Master to revoke the punishment! This is all my fault—I brought Guan Yu here, mistaking him for a suspicious figure. Punish me instead! I’ll accept two or three years of confinement, even in the back mountains. But please spare my master and senior sisters!”

After kowtowing deeply, Siqi’s loyalty was evident. Guan Yu observed her with admiration—not only was she beautiful, but her selfless heart and courage to shoulder blame for others were remarkable. Her sorrowful demeanor was heartrendingly pitiable, and even Guan Yu felt inferior to her nobility.

Yet this only fueled his anger. The responsibility should lie with that old hag, not an innocent disciple who stood there cowardly evading accountability. The injustice rankled him.

Xuan Ming privately regretted the severity of his decree but could not retract it without losing face. Stabilizing Guan Yu took precedence. “Rise,” he said to Siqi. “This matter is beyond your burden. You cannot bear such responsibility.”

Guan Yu, unwilling to see Siqi suffer further, interjected, “Sect Master Xuan has spoken—this isn’t your fault. I’m not leaving because of you. Please stand. The one accountable isn’t you.” His last remark pointedly hinted at someone else’s duty to act honorably.

Siqi remained kneeling, tearfully imploring Guan Yu, “Junior Brother, please stay. If you leave, Convergence Peak will be barred from the Six Peaks Assembly—a century-old disgrace! I beg you—plead for leniency!”

Guan Yu’s resolve wavered. How could anyone remain unmoved by such a distraught plea? Feigning reluctance, he sighed, “Very well, Master. I’ll stay—on two conditions.”

“You wish me to spare Convergence Peak? Their punishment is deserved,” Xuan Ming replied, relieved. “But your decision to remain heartens me.”

**Chapter 3153: Granting Full Face**

“Convergence Peak isn’t at fault—only Head Seat Dai (Thousand Purity) should be punished,” Guan Yu declared, gently helping Siqi rise. “The disciples must attend the Six Peaks Assembly. It’s their lifelong opportunity. Only Head Seat Dai need abstain.”

Head Seat Lu praised, “Guan Yu’s magnanimity shines through. Sect Master, spare the juniors.”

Xuan Ming acquiesced. “Head Seat Dai will face one year of confinement. Convergence Peak’s disciples are exempt.”

Siqi bowed gratefully. “Thank you, Sect Master, and Guan Yu.”

Guan Yu added, “My second condition: Head Seat Dai and Ling Su must never harass me—directly or through proxies.”

Xuan Ming agreed sternly, “Should they defy this, harsh consequences will follow.”

Guan Yu then demanded the return of his magic tools. Reluctantly, Dai Qianjie (Thousand Purity) surrendered the four artifacts she’d withheld.

“Lastly,” Guan Yu pressed, “Head Seat Dai must not retaliate against Siqi after we depart.”

Xuan Ming warned Dai Qianjie, “Any punishment toward Siqi will extend your confinement.”

Dai Qianjie acquiesced coldly, though a year’s seclusion meant little to an immortal centuries old.

Satisfied, Guan Yu conceded, “Master, I acted impulsively earlier. I’ll return to Grandmaster Jiu at the Ancestral Shrine.”

Jin Ciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) urged departure, but Guan Yu refused. “Master’s grace binds me. Inform Qiaoqiao and the others to await me at Front Return Peak.”

As Jin Ciyu Lang departed with Head Seat Lu, Guan Yu stole glances at Siqi, already plotting their next encounter.

**Chapter 3154: A Brilliant Scheme**

“Master, I’ll need an escort to the back mountains,” Guan Yu quipped. “Not Ling Su—I value my life.”

Xuan Ming chuckled. “Shall I personally escort you?”

“Let Senior Sister Siqi accompany me. Having saved her, she’ll hardly betray me.”

Xuan Ming deferred to Dai Qianjie, who reluctantly consented. Siqi agreed, despite her master’s glare.

Dai Qianjie insisted two disciples—Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian—join them, thwarting Guan Yu’s hopes of solitude.

**Chapter 3155: Scheme Accomplished**

Resigned, Guan Yu gripped the scented cloth bag Siqi offered. As she summoned her sword, he inhaled her floral fragrance, savoring the fleeting closeness.

“Hold tight,” Siqi instructed, her voice cool yet melodic.

Xuan Ming departed, leaving Dai Qianjie to watch sourly. Though resentful, she acknowledged Guan Yu’s role in salvaging Convergence Peak’s honor.

“Return swiftly,” Dai Qianjie ordered. “No delays.”

“Yes, Master,” the three disciples chorused.

Guan Yu hid his disappointment—Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian’s presence spoiled his plans. Yet Siqi’s safety mattered more.

As night deepened, Siqi’s sword gleamed, ready to ascend. Guan Yu clung to the bag, heart racing not from fear of heights, but anticipation of moments alone with the ethereal beauty beside him—however chaperoned.
