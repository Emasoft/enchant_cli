“Not at all. In fact, it’s quite nice not to speak. Many times, there’s no one to talk to anyway. Words often breed complications. At Juhe Peak, I’ve never been one for idle chatter. That’s why everyone thinks me aloof and cold.” Siqi smiled faintly.

This peculiar way of conversing with Guanyu felt strangely comforting to her. She stood inside the door with it slightly ajar, while he remained outside. Their casual banter across the threshold carried an odd yet pleasant intimacy.

Guanyu remarked, “Lately I’ve noticed you speaking more freely. Take this situation before us—the old you would never have acted this way. Are you forcing yourself for my sake?”

“It’s not exactly compulsion. I simply wish to help you, nothing more.” Siqi’s tone remained placid. “In the past, my silence stemmed from having no kindred spirit to confide in. Though Master treated me well and shared heartfelt talks, her usual severity created distance. At Juhe Peak... there truly was no one.”

“What if I kept you company more often?” Guanyu’s tender words flushed her cheeks.

Previously, not only had Siqi avoided conversation, but even this art of subtle manipulation had been taught by Guanyu. Without his guidance, she’d never have ventured into such schemes.

Ling Su and Lin Chen had long swaggered through Yunqing Sect, bullying weaker disciples while shielding their lackeys. Though Siqi found them detestable, she’d never considered opposing them—until their conflict with Guanyu arose. For his sake, she willingly transformed herself.

“Your understanding alone brings me joy.” Siqi’s voice softened. “There may be times when I overthink or act petulantly... I only hope you won’t resent me for it.”

“Never. You’ve changed so much for me—a devoted soul bearing every burden without complaint.” Guanyu’s gaze held gentle firmness. “If ever my demands overstep, voice your objections. Never suffer in silence. Understood?”

“I know your meaning. Rest assured, I won’t martyr myself.” Her obedience carried quiet strength.

Guanyu nodded, content. That Siqi would reshape herself thus for him already surpassed expectation. Knowing her fragile heart beneath the frost, he resolved to tread carefully around her boundaries.

“The hour grows late, and the day’s journey wearied us. You should rest.”

Siqi hesitated. Though fatigue weighted her limbs, abandoning Guanyu to the night felt wrong. “Oh, I’m not tired yet. Let me keep you company awhile longer.” Her forced chuckle betrayed exhaustion.

“Travels have hardened me to weariness.” Guanyu gestured toward the darkened streets. “I’ll take a stroll before joining Aze’s quarters. Don’t trouble yourself—sleep well.”

After a pregnant pause, Siqi declared with sudden resolve: “Then... come inside. We can converse properly here.”

She recognized his excuse—no decent establishment remained open this late. Surely he lacked proper lodging. Though inviting him breached decorum, she trusted his honor implicitly. Reputation mattered little compared to his comfort.

**Chapter 4347: Others’ Tales**

“Enter? Absolutely not!” Guanyu shook his head. “However you rationalize it, others’ gossip could ruin you. Our current arrangement suits me fine—there’s charm in novelty.”

Siqi’s smile held bittersweet understanding. Any other man would’ve leapt at such invitation, yet here stood Guanyu—a paradox who treated beauty with monastic restraint. Where lust-driven fools like Ling Su swarmed, he remained untouched, his allure lying in principled distance.

“I... only worry for your rest,” she murmured.

“Your concerns are mine. Hardship troubles me not.” His chuckle warmed the night. “Secure your door against opportunists.”

As Siqi retired, Guanyu wandered empty streets—farmers’ early rhythms rendering the town corpse-still. Returning to the inn’s common hall, he settled near a quarreling couple.

“Must your parents insult me thus?” The young man glared at cooling dishes. “Two hours late! Do they mock my efforts?”

His companion—a headstrong girl with beauty-marked cheek—snapped back: “Your whining shames us both! Father’s fields or Mother’s loom may detain them. Must you tally every copper spent?”

Guanyu sipped warmed wine, savoring their drama. The boy’s frustration mirrored the girl’s anxious glances at the door. Their bickering carried the raw authenticity of youth—clashing pride and devotion in equal measure.

**Chapter 4348: Locked Horns**

“You call this love?” The girl’s voice cracked. “Where are those grand promises and vows? Has a dog eaten your heart?”

“Promises feed no stomachs!” The boy gestured bitterly at lavish spreads. “My family’s last coins bought this welcome. For what? Cold meats and sour faces?”

Guanyu observed their dynamic—fire meeting fire. Unlike the simpering couples he’d known, their honesty might forge stronger bonds. Let pampered flowers wither; these wild sprouts would weather storms.

As the inn’s lamps guttered low, Guanyu pondered life’s strange parallels. Here sat youth’s tempest beside his own tranquil affection—both valid, both true. In Siqi’s quiet metamorphosis and these lovers’ clashing wills, he saw love’s infinite facets gleaming like scattered jade.
