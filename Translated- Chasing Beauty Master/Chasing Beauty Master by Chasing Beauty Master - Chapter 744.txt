Yao Yu gently shook her head. Her daughter had grown up and developed her own opinions. When love comes to a woman, no force in the world can stop its madness.

“Silly child, why must you… hmm… wrong yourself like this?” Yao Yu softly asked.

Lü Mei remained silent, her affectionate gaze fixed on Guan Yu. Yao Yu continued, “About a year ago, a man named Guan Yu was appointed as the new chairman of Huayu Group. I wonder if you’re aware of this?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Not only do I know him—I’m intimately familiar with him. Because I am…”

Yao Yu showed no surprise. Uncle Wang’s earlier reports had already hinted at Guan Yu’s identity, though she hadn’t fully believed it. She never imagined the chairman of Huayu Group would be such a young student.

**Chapter 1887: Full-Body Exercise**

Though Yao Yu disapproved of Guan Yu’s numerous romantic entanglements, in today’s society, men of his status keeping multiple partners was hardly unusual.

“Managing so many women without inciting jealousy speaks to your capabilities. I’ve also heard you helped Boss Lan resolve a clan-destroying crisis and won the heart of his daughter—the fearsome Miss Lan Yu whom everyone avoids.

Moreover, you rescued Yang Cheng from death’s door, earning the Yang family heiress’s affection, then conquered the heart of the pop star Ah Mei. I couldn’t fathom what kind of man possessed such charm. That’s why I’ve long wanted to meet you.”

Hearing “managing so many women” from his mother-in-law’s lips left Guan Yu both uncomfortable and speechless.

“I won’t oppose Lü Mei’s wishes. My allowing you here today means I accept your relationship. Ah… When a daughter grows up, her happiness becomes her own pursuit. I only ask that you leave a place for Lü Mei in your world.”

Yao Yu—rightly called “Jade Sister” in business circles—displayed a boldness surpassing most men. Such traits made her commercial success no accident.

Guan Yu knew it was time to pledge himself. “Auntie, rest assured. I’ll never let Lü Mei suffer.”

“I’ve always told Lü Mei to fight for her own happiness. Since she believes she’ll find it with you, let nature take its course.”

They moved to the dining room where Yao Yu had prepared an elaborate feast. Over dinner, she inquired, “As Huayu’s chairman, you must know about our collaborative project?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “I never involve myself in business matters. My elder sisters handle everything. I’m merely a figurehead chairman.”

“I see,” Yao Yu said. “The Lü family’s enterprises are deeply intertwined with Huayu. Our decade-long partnership is why we’ve remained among the Four Great Families. Huayu’s stability shelters us—it’s easier to rest in a giant tree’s shade.”

Business topics left Guan Yu adrift.

“I’d considered demanding a larger profit share from Huayu, given our hardware sales’ recent surge—our core industry. But now…” Yao Yu smiled ruefully.

Lü Mei frowned. “Mom, why abandon such opportunity? That percentage isn’t trivial!”

Yao Yu served her daughter fish. “This is your doing. Since you’ve chosen Huayu’s chairman, and you’re our sole heir, whatever I claim from Huayu would ultimately return to them through you.”

Understanding dawned on both youths. Guan Yu declared, “Auntie, even if Lü Mei inherits your enterprises, they’ll remain independent from Huayu. The Lü assets will always bear her name.”

Yao Yu feigned seriousness. “In that case, I’ll demand two additional percentage points from your sisters tomorrow. Then I’ll approve your relationship.”

“Mom! That’s extortion!” Lü Mei protested.

Yao Yu chuckled. “Look at her! Not even wed yet, yet she sides against me! Don’t fret—I jest. Sooner or later, everything will belong to Huayu anyway. I’m tired… It’s time to rest.” Her posture sagged, the weight of years spent upholding her late husband’s empire finally lifting.

Her daughter securing a tycoon’s affection meant less doting but guaranteed comfort—Yao Yu’s ultimate wish. She’d long awaited this moment when Lü Mei’s union would permit her retirement.

**Chapter 1888: How Old Are You?**

Post-dinner television brought late hours. Yao Yu excused herself for a meeting, while Guan Yu stayed overnight. Bathing in Lü Mei’s floral-scented, girlishly decorated bathroom, he donned her gifted pajamas.

Emerging, he found Lü Mei curled like a startled kitten on her bed. His pulse quickened.

Morning found Guan Yu waking late—a Saturday reprieve. Lü Mei still slept beside him, exhausted from nocturnal “full-body exercises” spanning bedroom, hallway, sofa, bathroom, and balcony. He kissed her cheek and rose.

Descending for water, kitchen noises led him to Yao Yu. “Awake? The walls here supposedly have good soundproofing. Yet last night’s… enthusiastic noises lasted till dawn. I barely slept.”

Lü Mei, overhearing, burned with shame. Had Mother witnessed their escapades? She pummeled Guan Yu’s shoulders. “This is all your fault!”

**Chapter 1889: Advancing to Quarterfinals**

Post-lunch farewells saw Guan Yu preparing for tomorrow’s citywide taekwondo tournament. Wei Hongwei called early—the match pitted K
