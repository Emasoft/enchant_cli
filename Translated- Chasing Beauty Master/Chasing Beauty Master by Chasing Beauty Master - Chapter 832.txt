Though her cultivation methods inclined her more towards the night, she harbored no fear of sunlight—merely experiencing diminished capabilities during daylight hours. As for her perpetual black robes, partiality for darkness accounted for one reason, while Guan Yu had rightly guessed the other: to conceal her features from prying eyes.

Guan Yu chuckled amiably, "Truthfully, your affairs hold no relation to me. I’ve no wish to meddle, yet... pitiable indeed."

Seeming to withhold further words, the Junior Sister pressed impatiently, "You wretch! ‘Pitiable’—who do you call pitiable?" Guan Yu had anticipated this confrontation would require calculated provocation to avert bloodshed.

"Why, you of course! Could it be me?" His laughter rang out before continuing, "By appearances, you must be ancient—far older than Uncle Qing, I’d wager. Why else veil your face? Withered blossoms and fallen willow, no doubt?"

"You insolent cur! Mind your tongue!" The Junior Sister’s fury tightened her grip, strangling the breaths of Mr. and Mrs. Qing. Their disciple protested, "Guan Yu! What madness drives you? Provoking her only deepens my masters’ agony!"

"Whether Uncle and Aunt Qing suffer depends not on our words, but this venerable crone’s whims." Guan Yu’s smile remained unperturbed.

Ignoring him, the disciple addressed the Junior Sister, "Elder, I offer my life in exchange for my masters’."

Her eyes flashed. "Whelp! You presume your worthless carcass merits two lives? Laughable!"

Guan Yu interjected, "Ah, this aged madam truly—"

"Utter ‘crone’ again, and I slit her throat!" The Junior Sister jerked Mrs. Qing forward, blade at her neck.

"Very well—not a crone. Yet dare you unveil your face? Elsewise, the title stands." Guan Yu’s grin widened.

The Junior Sister’s chest heaved with ragged breaths, fury radiating from her. Guan Yu pressed, "A forsaken hag since youth, now too grotesque to show your face. Few spinsters of your vintage remain in this world!"

As he spoke, he twirled his military dagger—his sole remaining blade after abandoning Yang Conghan’s knife in the tropical forest.

Silenced by rage, the Junior Sister endured his merciless taunts: "No wonder Uncle Qing abandoned you! Blame your father’s deceit, not him! Decades nursing resentment prove your ugliness bars you from seeking new suitors—fearing rejection anew!"

"Silence!" Her roar severed his words.

Guan Yu feigned alarm. "As an outsider, I’ll take my leave." He turned to depart, but the enraged Junior Sister unleashed two doppelgangers to intercept him.

Anticipating this, Guan Yu lunged toward her main body, dagger slashing at her arm. As predicted, the doppelganger gripping the Qings dissolved to protect its limb.

Seizing the couple, Guan Yu retreated. Though the doppelganger had perfectly mimicked its master’s voice, sunlight’s failure to gleam on its form had betrayed its illusory nature.

"Impressive cultivation," Guan Yu mused. "To manifest such flawless clones under full sun—your skills ascend new heights."

His calculated provocation had succeeded. As the remaining clones fled, the Junior Sister’s voice echoed: "Meddling brat! This isn’t over!"

Guan Yu sighed. Her shadowy comings and goings—whether corporeal or spectral—made her a formidable nuisance. Now understanding her daylight boldness stemmed from sending a clone, he turned to the coughing Uncle Qing.

After an hour of energy transfer, the old man stabilized. "Foolish old man!" Mrs. Qing chided tearfully.

Uncle Qing sighed. Abandoning his wife was unthinkable—such weakness would’ve killed him during his serpent-venom ordeal.

"Had I your place, Aunt Qing, I’d stay too," Guan Yu consoled as Mrs. Qing fetched tea.

"You’ve saved me from hell itself," Uncle Qing rasped gratefully.

"Family needs no thanks," Guan Yu demurred. "But how did you discern the clone?"

"Daylight weakens her. Yet sunlight didn’t reflect off her robes—more like black mist than fabric."

Uncle Qing nodded. "Her cultivation warps dangerously, yet such daytime clones... At night, even my prime self couldn’t best her."

"You must relocate—she’ll return."

Mrs. Qing wrung her hands upon reentering. "Leave? But where? We’ve tended these snakes..."

Guan Yu eyed the humble cottage and loyal guard nursing bruised ribs. Hou Jinshun’s distant property became their refuge—a day’s journey north near Yun City’s outskirts.

Packing the pickup truck with serpent-filled crates, they departed. The spacious villa’s marble walls and tiled floors daunted the couple. "Merely housesitting," Guan Yu insisted, pressing a cash-stuffed bag into Mrs. Qing’s reluctant hands.

**Chapter 2132: Commotion at the School Gates**

The truck bed overflowed with quilts masking venomous cargo—Uncle Qing’s lifeline against recurring toxins. Navigating Hou Jinshun’s directions, they reached an opulent countryside estate where marble steps led to spotless rooms awaiting habitation.

"This... this is too grand," Mrs. Qing whispered.

"Better guarded here," Guan Yu assured, unloading serpents into the courtyard. After arranging necessities, he departed with warnings: "Contact none—not even Ling’er. I’ll protect her."

As the Qing couple settled into reluctant exile, far removed from serpent markets and familial dangers, Guan Yu contemplated the brewing storm—knowing the Junior Sister’s vengeance would strike when least expected.
