Bo Jie’s breathing grew heavier. He naturally believed Feng Minglun’s words. Though Feng was merely a CEO, their current contractual ties meant any underhanded tactics from him could spell significant trouble.

Feng Minglun sauntered to Gao Wei’s side and slumped into a chair, reeking of alcohol. His lecherous gaze fixed on her as he slurred, “I know stars like you have a price. Name it. I’ll have you for the night.”

**Chapter 509: The Shameless CEO**

“Name your price. I’ll have you for the night.”

This phrase, whether overt or veiled, had become a refrain in countless settings—a tacit rule of the entertainment industry. Feng Minglun saw himself as merely following convention. To him, such propositions were commonplace; his only fault was being less discreet.

“Since Miss Gao disliked my previous approach,” Feng sneered, emphasizing each word, “let’s speak plainly. Isn’t this… *frankness*?”

The once-respectable term “frankness” dripped with vulgarity from his lips. Gao Wei understood his implication perfectly. She had never imagined the suave CEO of Dior Greater China harbored such depravity—a wolf in tailored clothing.

“Disgusting,” she hissed, fists clenched so tightly her knuckles whitened.

“*Me*, disgusting?” Feng belched, his rancid breath assaulting her. Gao recoiled, face twisted in revulsion.

“Compared to you, I’m a saint,” he jeered. “I once thought you truly were the ‘Jade Maiden’—untouched by the industry’s filth. But after today?” He barked a laugh. “One little flirtation, and you threw yourself at me. Offer enough cash, and you’d spread your legs for anyone. Your ‘purity’ is a joke. If anyone’s disgusting, it’s *you*.”

“You’re no jade maiden—just a common whore.”

Though Gao’s impulsive kiss had tarnished her pristine image, Feng’s vile accusations crossed every line. Humiliation burned her cheeks crimson. Without thinking, she seized her wine glass and hurled its contents at his face.

*Splash.*

The scarlet liquid drenched Feng’s white collar, staining it blood-red. Rivulets dripped down his contorted features as he licked his lips mockingly.

“Did I strike a nerve?” He chuckled, unfazed. “I admire your act—playing hard-to-get while stoking men’s desires. The colder you pretend, the higher your price. Clever girl.”

His words reeked of sour grapes. Having failed to seduce her, he sought to defile her reputation instead.

Gao’s face paled, then flushed anew. She shot up from her seat. “Guan Yu! We’re leaving.”

“Not so fast.” Feng lunged, his wine-flushed hand clamping her wrist. “Think I’m beneath you? Name their price—I’ll double it. I’ll skyrocket your career. This deal’s golden.”

“Let. Go.” Her voice chilled. Engaging him would only fuel his audacity.

“Don’t test me, Gao Wei.” Feng’s grip tightened. “I can make you—or break you.”

When threats failed, he resorted to brute force, his CEO veneer crumbling into street-thug vulgarity.

“Feng Minglun, release her!” Bo Jie’s enraged shout cut through the tension. The actor stood trembling, eyes blazing. “Have you no decency?!”

“I don’t take orders from has-beens,” Feng spat without glancing back.

“I’ll call the police!”

“Go ahead!” Feng smirked. “See whose connections run deeper in N City. You’re outmatched, pretty boy.”

Bo Jie faltered. For all his fame, he knew his career hung by corporate strings. Yet watching Gao suffer? Unbearable.

“I can’t defeat you,” he growled, dialing his phone, “but I won’t let you win.”

Feng shrugged. Let the fool try—the cops owed *him* favors.

“Guan Yu.” Gao’s sharp tone sliced the air. Her gaze swung to the young man obliviously devouring his meal, then belching contentedly. Rage simmered.

This was her *shield*? This gluttonous student who’d done nothing but feast while she endured harassment?

At her call, Guan Yu rose, toothpick dangling. “Done eating. Let’s check on those takeout boxes.”

Feng brightened. Finally, the oaf showed sense! “Go on,” he waved magnanimously.

“You—!” Gao stared incredulously. Was he *abandoning* her?

Bo Jie reddened with secondhand shame. “You’re her *boyfriend*! How can you—?”

“Boyfriend?!” Feng howled. “Oh, this is rich! My condolences, Miss Gao.”

She ignored him, studying Guan Yu’s retreating back. There—a faint, dangerous smirk.

Moments later, the door reopened. Guan Yu strolled in, all innocence. “Takeout’s ready.”

“Leaving so soon?” Feng simpered.

“Actually,” Guan Yu eyed Feng’s lingering grip on Gao, “I’ve decided to stay.”

Before Feng could react, an iron vise clamped his throat. A karate chop snapped his wrist—*crack*—forcing release.

Guan Yu hoisted the choking CEO overhead. “Since you treated me to dinner,” he purred, “I’ll return the favor. Let’s enjoy… a *Manchu-Han Imperial Feast*.”

**Chapter 510: The Feast Begins**

Feng’s legs flailed as oxygen dwindled. Panic dawned—this nobody he’d dismissed now held his life in one hand.

A knee drove into his gut. Feng crumpled, retching half-digested delicacies across his designer suit.

“Careful,” Gao murmured, though her eyes glittered. “Don’t kill him.”

“Worried about me?” Guan Yu teased.

“About *paperwork*,” she scoffed, cheeks pink.

A server entered with the “takeout”—platters meant for Feng’s humiliation. Guan Yu beamed. “Our host’s had too much drink. You may leave.”

As the door shut, he loomed over the groaning CEO. “Now… about that feast.”
