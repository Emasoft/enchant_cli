Damn it, the guy’s explanation only fueled Guan Yu’s fury further. Ordinary missiles might fail to kill Mutants, but this one had been specifically engineered for them—a different matter entirely. The missile hadn’t harmed Guan Yu primarily because his spiritual energy instinctively reacted to the impending threat, forming a protective barrier around him.

Consider this: had it been anyone else—even Mutants like Mu Yun or Xue Yingfeng, whose powers far surpassed ordinary humans—how could flesh withstand a missile capable of shredding steel? They’d be lucky to escape with their lives.

The Guan Yu of today was no reckless youth from two decades ago. Though rage simmered in his chest, his voice remained icy as he addressed the man: “Splendid. Using me as target practice for your weapons. Let me enlighten you: your missile works. A Third-Class Mutant would be crippled by now. A Second-Class would lose combat capacity temporarily. Even a First-Class would suffer thirty percent power reduction. Any more questions?”

Both the man and the soldiers behind him sensed the suppressed fury in Guan Yu’s tone. The man offered an awkward smile. “Apologies, Elder Guan. We had no choice. The world’s changed in twenty years. Technology advances rapidly. Intel shows Eastern Island has developed a Replicant Project—they can clone anyone with sufficient data. You vanished from the Divine Realm two decades ago. Your sudden reappearance...we had to test if you were Eastern Island’s copy. Only those returning from the Divine Realm could survive such a strike unscathed.”

Damn it. So if the missile had knocked me from the sky, they’d have vaporized me with heavier firepower? Guan Yu’s frustration deepened as the man elaborated on their predicament.

According to Hua Xia’s intelligence, Eastern Island was targeting Hua Xia’s Mutants. Over twenty years, nations had sent personnel near the Divine Realm to bolster their Mutant numbers. Now, a nation’s strength wasn’t measured merely by economy or military, but by Mutants—a crucial factor.

Eastern Island, ever covetous of Hua Xia, struggled with Mutant development. Their population’s physical limitations meant less than one in ten thousand subjects survived the transformation experiments. Rumor claimed they’d produced fewer than ten successful Mutants.

Considering their population, ten seemed significant—until one realized Eastern Island had sent ten times more subjects than major powers like Hua Xia or America. The massive civilian casualties sparked fierce domestic opposition.

Unlike nations using death row inmates or volunteers from organizations like the Dragon Group, Eastern Island resorted to conscripting ordinary citizens. With public dissent rising, their politicians sought alternatives to Mutant experiments.

Admittedly, Eastern Island excelled at scientific innovation. They devised two solutions: weapons from the Ouyang family’s enterprises to neutralize foreign Mutants, effectively boosting their own relative strength, and Replicant Mutants—clones matching original subjects’ DNA and data, though their power equivalence remained unverified.

**Chapter 1669: The Dragon Group’s Invitation**

Yesterday, Xue Yingfeng mentioned domestic Mutants forming the rebellious Fengyun Society. Now this man spoke of Eastern Island’s schemes against Hua Xia—troubles within and without converging.

Through conversation, Guan Yu learned the Zhongshan-suited man was Feng Shaozheng, Deputy Leader of the Dragon Group, assisted by Ling Hong. Feng handled external affairs, separate from Xue Yingfeng’s department.

Having briefly joined the Dragon Group years prior, Guan Yu remained unfamiliar with its internal structure. When asked his purpose, Feng grew uneasy. Had he known Guan Yu’s true identity, he’d never have approved the missile test.

As Deputy Leader, Feng usually maintained composure before military brass or high-ranking officials. Yet facing Guan Yu, even Lieutenant Colonel Zheng Rongguang—commanding nearly two thousand troops—felt unnerved.

Unbeknownst to them, their worldly experience paled against Guan Yu’s two decades in the demonic realms. Wars here were child’s play compared to those horrors.

Guan Yu showed no particular reaction to the missile incident. His voice chilled: “I despise backstabbers. You have your reasons; I have my limits. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.”

As he turned to depart, Feng’s pride bristled. He’d expected gratitude for revealing Eastern Island’s plot, not dismissal.

Ling Hong drew an odd-shaped pistol, aiming at Guan Yu’s back. “Halt!”

Soldiers followed suit, weapons trained on Guan Yu. Zheng Rongguang watched gravely but stayed silent.

Feng, a martial arts inheritor of considerable skill, assumed Guan Yu was merely a powerful Mutant like Xue Yingfeng. Zheng, however, sensed Guan Yu transcended such classifications—his cultivation defied comprehension.

Guan Yu paused. “Ling Hong. Another shot in the back?”

The assistant tightened his grip. “Don’t think your Mutant abilities make you invincible! This weapon, modeled after Eastern Island’s designs, can disable Mutants. As a Dragon Group member, you should’ve reported immediately instead of hiding in Y City’s elite schools, causing public disturbances. We’re here to bring you back!”

Interrupted mid-flight to reunite with Liu Shilei, then threatened again, Guan Yu’s anger erupted. An invisible force wave hurled Ling Hong against the cavern wall, his weapon clattering away as he collapsed, bloodied and motionless.

Feng stared in shock. He’d expected compliance, not defiance. But Guan Yu, tempered by demonic trials, answered to no authority—not even the Dragon Group’s leader.

To them, advanced weaponry intimidated Mutants. To Guan Yu, nothing in this world could restrain him if provoked.

Yet he wasn’t wantonly destructive. He demanded respect. Twenty years of hellish trials in the demonic realms warranted at least basic human concern—not this bureaucratic interrogation.

**Chapter 1670: Deterrence**

Upon returning, Guan Yu found himself hailed as a national hero. Yet the Dragon Group’s first move wasn’t to inquire about his ordeal, but to demand servitude.

Did they imagine the demonic tower’s trials less grueling than Mutant experiments? Where was their basic humanity?

Though seven subjective years in the demonic realms translated to twenty Earth years, Guan Yu felt centuries older. Exhausted, he sought only to reunite with Liu Shilei and live quietly—a naive hope in this troubled world.

He’d agreed to discuss the Fengyun Society in three days. Feng’s impatience—and that missile—crossed a line.

Guan Yu’s restraint spared Ling Hong’s life, leaving him severely injured. Seeing this, Zheng urged Feng to tread carefully.

Feng, however, exploded: “You dare attack Dragon Group members? Do you think national propaganda makes you untouchable? Twenty years shirking duty, then causing chaos—you’ll face disciplinary action!”

Guan Yu laughed mirthlessly. “Discipline? Imprisonment? Power sealing?”

His gaze locked onto Feng, who suddenly realized the chasm between them—a pressure suggesting Guan Yu could obliterate him with a thought.

Zheng broke into cold sweat. Though not the target, the aura made his knees weak.

Guan Yu’s voice echoed through the chamber: “My ID expired a decade ago. My Dragon Group tenure lapsed after three. Treat me as dead. I’ve agreed to meet in three days regarding the Fengyun Society. Speak again unwisely, and I’ll silence you permanently.”

He vanished like erased artwork.

Guards reported no exit sighting. Feng gaped, unable to comprehend. Zheng breathed deeply. “He’s no Mutant. His cultivation surpasses imagination. No earthly force can oppose him. Heed his warning.”

Feng, for once, didn’t argue.

Teleporting to Y City, Guan Yu headed for Liu Shilei’s residence—only to sense Xue Yingfeng nearby. The sleepless night continued.
