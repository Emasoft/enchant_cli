**Chapter 1968: A Visit**

Within a few short years, these five individuals had each built their own enterprises, rising to prominence as the Five Great Families of City A. In the eyes of the public, their ascent was inevitable after the Jin Family’s downfall, for shifts in power were commonplace throughout history. Yet gradually, observant minds began to notice something unusual.

After dividing the treasures equally, the five pretended to have never known one another, each leveraging their share to forge their own fortunes.

In just a few years, they established themselves as the Five Great Families of City A. To the citizens, their rise after the Jin Family’s demise seemed natural—a routine changing of the guard. But slowly, whispers arose.

The Zhang Family’s wealth began to surface, and the magnitude of their riches soon eclipsed the combined resources of the other four families.

Over time, City A evolved with the Zhangs reigning supreme, while the other four families faded into obscurity. Bolstered by their immense wealth, the Zhangs’ influence surged, nearly surpassing the Jin Family’s former glory.

It was then that the other families sensed something amiss. The Zhangs’ wealth defied logic. After prolonged investigation, a discovery shook them:

The original plan had been to split the Jin Family’s assets equally. Yet when Zhang was chosen as the mole to infiltrate the Jins, he had secretly mapped out their entire operation. After the heist, he led the others to loot only a small vault, while hoarding the main treasury for himself.

When the four families uncovered this betrayal, they initially feigned ignorance. Privately, however, their patriarchs conspired to eradicate the Zhangs.

Gathered in secrecy, the patriarchs seethed. “We were all grasshoppers tied to the same string,” growled the Ran Family patriarch. “Yet Zhang dared to swallow the lion’s share! He spits on our alliance!”

“Now he towers over the city, his power eclipsing even the Jins’,” added the Feng Family patriarch. “If left unchecked, he’ll devour us all.”

The Yang and Lü Families agreed. Fearing the Zhangs’ dominance, the four devised a scheme to eliminate them.

Their plot unfolded with meticulous precision, catching the Zhangs off guard.

When the Zhangs celebrated their daughter’s thousandth-day birthday with a grand banquet, they invited luminaries from across the martial world. This very event became their undoing.

The four families bribed supernatural experts to infiltrate the Zhang estate, triggering a bloody battle. The Zhang patriarch fell, as did the Lü Family’s leader. But the Zhang matriarch, a formidable cultivator herself, slaughtered many foes before fleeing with her infant, grievously wounded.

Hiding in a safe haven, she channeled her dying energy to imprint memories into the child’s mind, sealing them away before taking her own life.

The four families ransacked the Zhangs’ assets but found only fixed properties—none of the legendary treasures.

Discovering the child beside the dead matriarch, the Yangs spared her, hoping she alone knew the treasure’s location. They raised her as their own. That child, now a young woman, was Zhang Han.

Guan Yu’s mind raced. Lü Mei and Qing Linger had both mentioned fathers killed in a great battle over a decade ago—the very coup that toppled the Zhangs. Qing Linger’s father had been a major family’s steward, likely the Zhangs’.

The four families’ ambition had destroyed the Zhangs yet yielded little reward. Now, Zhang Han lived unaware among her clan’s murderers. Guan Yu shuddered to imagine her reaction upon learning the truth.

Two mysteries gnawed at him: Why had Jinhua targeted Zhang Han instead of the four families? And why had the Yangs spared the girl, risking future vengeance? Deeper secrets lurked beneath.

Finding Jinhua would unveil the answers.

Hou Jinshun remarked, “I learned this from an elder. My disbelief mirrored yours.”

“We must find Jinhua soon,” Guan Yu replied.

Leaving Huaye, Guan Yu headed to the Yang estate to visit Zhang Han under the pretext of seeing Patriarch Yang Qiankun.

At the Yangs’, Yang Cheng greeted him warmly. “Guan Yu! It’s been too long. What brings you here?”

“I came to visit the patriarch and Zhang Han,” Guan Yu said.

A voice chirped, “I knew Uncle would miss me!” Zhang Han leapt onto Guan Yu, clinging to his neck.

Yang Cheng chided, “Hanhan, behave yourself!”

Ignoring him, Zhang Han pleaded, “Uncle, I’m so bored! They won’t let me leave—not even for school! Take me out, please?”

**Chapter 1969: A Clever Young Man**

“Alright,” Guan Yu agreed, startling her with his swiftness.

“But first, I need to discuss matters with the adults. I’ll fetch you later.” He hid a wince as she jostled his wounded arm.

Once she skipped away, Yang Cheng sighed. “Forgive her—she’s been spoiled rotten.”

“I adore her spirit,” Guan Yu said.

In the main hall, Guan Yu asked after Yang Qiankun. Yang Cheng frowned. “Father’s been ill—fever, chills. He refuses treatment, even a diagnostic energy scan.”

Guan Yu volunteered to “visit,” not treat him. Yang Cheng brightened. “Brilliant!”

In the patriarch’s chamber, Yang Conghan played Go with her ailing grandfather. Guan Yu clasped the old man’s hand, surreptitiously channeling energy to assess his condition.

“You’ve remembered this old bone,” Yang Qiankun rasped.

After exchanging pleasantries, Guan Yu diagnosed, “A urinary tract infection from residual kidney stones.”

Yang Conghan gasped. “How did you—?”

“During our handshake,” Guan Yu smiled.

Yang Cheng lamented, “If only Father had let me examine him earlier!”

“Mix antibiotics into his food,” Guan Yu advised. “The fever will break within a week.”

“Youth outwits age again!” Yang Cheng laughed.

Shifting to weightier matters, Guan Yu asked about Jinhua. Yang Cheng scowled. “A maid for years, yet she betrayed us. I, who prided myself on judging character, fell for her act!”

“Why target Hanhan?” Guan Yu probed, watching for tells.

Yang Cheng remained impassive. “She owns nothing of value.”

*Liar,* Guan Yu thought. *Hanhan holds the key to the Zhang fortune—a secret the Yangs have kept from the other families.* Yet if they’d already extracted the secret, their power would dwarf current heights. Clearly, the mystery endured.

Yang Conghan recalled Jinhua’s arrival: found unconscious at Huaye’s doorstep three winters prior, a “country girl” with “honest parents.” Both had since vanished.

“Fabricated identities,” Guan Yu deduced. Jinhua had bided her time, using mild poisons repeatedly—undetected until Guan Yu found the incense.

If Jinhua revealed the truth to Zhang Han, chaos would reign. Silence was paramount.

As Guan Yu prepared to leave with Zhang Han, Yang Cheng urged, “Stay for dinner!”

“Another time,” Guan Yu declined. The girl’s laughter echoed ahead, oblivious to the storm brewing around her.

**Chapter 1970: False Identities**

Yang Cheng’s composure held. “Who would covet anything from Hanhan?”

Sipping tea, Guan Yu mused, *The Yangs have hidden her secret for years. Should the other families learn, they’d unite against them.*

Yet perhaps the Yangs remained ignorant too. If they’d uncovered the treasure, their dominance would be absolute.

Zhang Han’s innocence shielded her—and them. But for how long?

“When did Jinhua join your household?” Guan Yu asked.

“Three years ago,” Yang Conghan replied. “She collapsed at Huaye, claiming to be a penniless villager. We verified her ‘parents’—actors, clearly.”

Guan Yu pressed, “You didn’t vet her thoroughly?”

“We did!” Yang Cheng insisted. “Those ‘parents’ vanished post-betrayal.”

Jinhua’s patience was chilling. Repeated attempts to probe Zhang Han’s mind had failed—until Guan Yu’s arrival.

“Hanhan often woke dizzy,” Yang Conghan recalled. “Jinhua must’ve drugged her for years.”

Guan Yu nodded. “If Jinhua returns and enlightens Hanhan, all collapses. The truth must remain buried.”

Rising, he said, “I’ll take Hanhan out now. She’s suffocating here.”

Yang Cheng nodded. “Safe travels, Guan Yu. And… thank you.”

As Guan Yu departed with the bubbly Zhang Han, the weight of unspoken truths hung heavy. Some secrets, once unearthed, could topple empires.
