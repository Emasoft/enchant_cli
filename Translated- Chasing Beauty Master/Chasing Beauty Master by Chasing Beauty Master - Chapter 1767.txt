Guan Yu pondered that this place must be intricately connected to Huaxia. The Ghost Festival observed here mirrored Huaxia’s traditions, and Miao City’s architecture was undoubtedly modeled after Huaxia’s designs—though whether the materials were locally sourced or transported from Huaxia remained unclear.

Unlike Wang Jun’s exaggerated demeanor, Guan Yu maintained his composure. Siqi, overhearing their conversation, turned and asked, “Guan Yu, does this place truly resemble your homeland?”

Siqi thought that if it indeed mirrored Guan Yu’s home, it would be worth memorizing its details. Familiarity might ease future visits and soften the shock of encountering Huaxia’s wonders.

“Though many differences exist, the buildings here—what we call ‘apartment complexes’—are nearly identical to those in certain parts of my homeland,” Guan Yu replied.

“Exactly!” Wang Jun chimed in. “These clusters of buildings resemble residential compounds. When I first arrived, I wandered inside on impulse. The familiarity was overwhelming—even the attire of the yao practitioners matches Huaxia’s styles. Isn’t that remarkable?”

Though Wang Jun spoke animatedly, Guan Yu recognized that Miao City’s parallels with Huaxia were superficial. This was still Miao City, distinct in its essence.

Xiao Hei (Little Black) suddenly moved like a thief, her steps light and posture hunched. The group followed curiously, until she whispered, “Stop talking. We must pass through silently. Any noise could expose us.”

Xiao Mei added, “Be cautious. Today is the Ghost Festival—few venture out. If discovered, even I cannot protect you. The Miao Zhang (Village Chief) will surely punish you.”

Guan Yu deduced the “Miao Zhang” referred to the local authority. Xiao Hei led them along Miao City’s outskirts—a pathless plain bordered by distant mountains to the right and the city’s edge to the left. A swift river, five meters wide, carved through the terrain, its currents fueled by mountain waterfalls. The landscape, though lush, lay shrouded in oppressive fog.

Guan Yu tensed. This route was perilously exposed. Without city walls, the adjacent buildings posed risks. Xiao Hei warned them to keep heads lowered—faces hidden—to avoid recognition as outsiders.

The group moved in single file, silent as shadows. After half an hour, Guan Yu estimated they’d traversed five miles. Miao City’s vastness hinted at a dense yao population. Survival now hinged on remaining undetected.

A woman’s voice pierced the silence: “We mean no harm. We stumbled here by accident. Let us leave peacefully.”

A man retorted, “I care not for your reasons. Leave now, or we will slaughter you.”

Xiao Hei halted abruptly—the man’s voice belonged to the Miao Zhang. “Wait here,” she urged. “Let’s assess the situation first.”

The group agreed, though Guan Yu wondered about the woman’s identity. Wang Jun whispered, “That voice… it’s Lai Lixia of the Red Lotus Sect!”

Guan Yu nodded. “Red Lotus Sect’s here. But why seek entry to Miao City? They should be heading to Flower Mountain.”

“Perhaps they believe the Eight-Sided Drum technique lies within,” Guan Yu speculated. Knowing the Miao Zhang barred outsiders, he hoped conflict would erupt, allowing their escape.

Seizing an opportunity, Guan Yu coaxed Xiao Hei: “Help us now, and I’ll bring more honey cakes next time.”

“Yes! I’ll do anything for treats!” Xiao Hei agreed, darting off to urge the Miao Zhang to attack.

Siqi frowned. “Manipulating a child is low—even if she’s a centuries-old bear spirit.”

“We’ve no time for niceties,” Guan Yu replied coldly. “The Red Lotus Sect won’t perish here—they’ll flee. Their distraction is our chance.”

As Xiao Hei reached the Miao Zhang, her loose tongue nearly betrayed them. “A ‘big brother’ promised me sweets if you drive these intruders away!”

Guan Yu’s heart sank. Wang Jun muttered, “I told you trusting a child was reckless.”

The Miao Zhang pressed Xiao Hei: “Who is this ‘big brother’?”

Spotting Guan Yu’s hidden group, Xiao Hei improvised: “He’s gone now! But he said these people are troublemakers!”

Lai Lixia, sensing danger, retreated. “We’ll leave peacefully.”

“No!” Xiao Hei hissed, her mouth glowing with gathering energy.

The Miao Zhang restrained her. “Why this aggression today?”

Guan Yu realized their cover teetered. “We must rush now—before they’re exposed!”

**Chapter 4624: Careless Heart**

As tensions peaked, Guan Yu prepared to bolt. The Miao Zhang’s suspicion grew, but Lai Lixia’s presence offered a fleeting window. Xiao Hei’s mishap underscored the folly of relying on a child—yet desperation left no alternatives.

“Run!” Guan Yu hissed. The group surged forward, gambling that chaos would cloak their escape. Behind them, Xiao Hei’s misplaced loyalty and the Red Lotus Sect’s confrontation with the Miao Zhang unfolded—a precarious dance of survival in a city mirroring a homeland, yet foreign in every perilous twist.
