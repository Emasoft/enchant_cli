“But… during that kiss earlier, I actually felt a little moved. My heart was racing, it felt so blissful.” Du Xiaojuan’s eyes sparkled with suppressed excitement as she tugged Guan Yu’s arm, her youthful energy overflowing.

He was utterly defeated by her persistence. Must they keep circling back to this topic? Guan Yu admitted his earlier impulsiveness, but since things couldn’t progress further, couldn’t they drop it? His barely calmed emotions were churning again.

“Why are you blushing? I’m not even saying anything embarrassing!” Du Xiaojuan giggled mischievously, pinching both his cheeks.

Guan Yu turned his head with a silent protest, earning another peal of laughter.

“Hey… junior,” she suddenly adopted a conspiratorial whisper, her playful expression hinting at mischief. “Let’s make a deal.”

“What is it?” Guan Yu propped himself against the headboard with a pillow.

“What happened today… let’s keep it our secret. Don’t tell anyone, okay?”

Obviously. Why would he broadcast this? With an exasperated nod, he watched her face light up.

“Perfect! Now… let’s kiss again!” In a whirl of motion, she straddled his lap, eyes shining with exhilaration as she leaned in.

Guan Yu froze. Had he heard correctly?

“No one will know if we don’t tell! Let’s treat it as practice. Kissing feels amazing – so thrilling!” She winked, fingers tangling in his hair as she tilted his face upward.

Suddenly, his calm shattered. Her initiative sent his pulse skyrocketing, the anticipation dizzying. When their lips met, fireworks erupted behind his eyelids.

“Wait…” He gulped, palm against her forehead.

“What’s wrong?” Her flushed face hovered inches away.

“Can I… touch you here?” The question burned his tongue, his pounding heart threatening to burst.

“Shameless! Groping a girl’s chest? You pervert!” She scolded through crimson cheeks, though her position – straddling him with their lower bodies aligned – contradicted her words.

The irony wasn’t lost on him. She currently embodied the “pervert” accusation, her warmth pressing against his straining jeans. When she finally guided his hand beneath her shirt, he surged upward, capturing her mouth hungrily.

Through layers of fabric, her softness teased his palm. Driven by primal instinct, his fingers crept under her bra. The moment bare skin met his touch, euphoria shuddered through him – satin warmth filling his hand.

“Senior… your lips taste like honey,” he murmured during a breathless pause. Her answering blush delighted him, as did the dazed look in her eyes.

His wandering hand cupped her breast possessively. “Can I… see them?”

“See what?” Her whisper trembled.

“These.” His thumb brushed a hardened peak.

“You’re pushing your luck!” Yet even as she protested, her breathing quickened. When he promised mere visual admiration, she relented with a shy nod.

Revealing her breasts felt like unwrapping sacred art – alabaster skin blushing pink, perfection that stole his breath. Burying his face between them, he inhaled her essence: floral shampoo, warm skin, and something uniquely her.

“Ah…” Her back arched when his mouth found a nipple, fingers clutching his hair. The erotic tableau – her hair cascading, body offered freely – intoxicated him beyond reason.

Driven by instinct, his hand slid past her waistband. Her whimper stopped him.

“Just… just looking,” he pleaded, though his throbbing arousal betrayed him. When she hesitantly allowed access, he nearly wept with frustration at the final barrier of thin cotton.

The ringing phone shattered the moment. Reluctantly withdrawing, Guan Yu checked the caller ID while Du Xiaojuan hastily rearranged her clothes.

“Guan Yu? Where are you?” Fu Linlin’s voice held urgency. “Wang Fubin hired local gangsters. You need to leave!”

“Let them come.” His arm tightened around Du Xiaojuan, savoring her nestled warmth.

“Please! Meet me, just briefly—”

“No need.” He hung up on her pleas, smirking at his former obsession’s desperation. Here, with this vibrant creature in his arms, past grievances felt trivial. Let storms rage outside – this sanctuary of tangled limbs and stolen breaths was all that mattered.
