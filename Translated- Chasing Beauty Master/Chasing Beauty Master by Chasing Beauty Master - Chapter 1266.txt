“Spare me your lectures. Better tend to your own flaws first.” Guan Yu dismissed the opponent with a wave. “I respect elders only when they deserve respect. If speaking truth violates sect rules, then shouldn’t Xiang Shouzhuo’s disciples Acai and Wenming face graver consequences?”

Xiang Shouzhuo immediately retorted, “Guan Yu, mind your words! My disciples stand here silent. Why slander them? What rules have they broken? Even if they struck first, did you need to retaliate so brutally?”

“Indeed, Guan Yu, you went too far,” Ling Su interjected with feigned concern. “Younger brother Acai’s injuries are severe. Apologize now. I’m sure he’ll show leniency given your contrition.”

“Save your breath, Ling Su,” Guan Yu snapped coldly. “Don’t meddle with false righteousness.” He pointed at Acai and Wenming. “The true offenders stand here. Does the honorable Xiang Shouzhuo not know why his disciples, who should be in confinement, now attend tomorrow’s Six Peaks Assembly? Is this not our master’s magnanimity at work?”

“Nonsense!” Ling Su countered smoothly, playing mediator. “Elder Xiang governs his disciples impeccably. Why imply bribery?” His words dripped with plausible concern.

Guan Yu’s laugh held ice. “Since you’re so eager to speak, Senior Brother Ling Su, enumerate my supposed transgressions. Which sect laws did I breach? What punishments await?”

Ling Su faltered. The Yunqing Sect’s voluminous rules had never concerned him beyond knowing disrespect toward elders warranted punishment.

“Cat got your tongue?” Guan Yu pressed as onlookers murmured agreement. “You accuse without specifics – a farcical spectacle.”

Turning to the crowd, Guan Yu declared, “Let me clarify Acai and Wenming’s misdeeds. All know the woods near Tiger Head Peak lead to the Ancestral Shrine – forbidden to disciples without permission. Trespassers face harsh penalties: yearly confinement at minimum, execution by cudgel at worst. Yet circumstances often soften judgments.”

“Recently, these two sneaked into those woods hunting rabbits and pheasants – perhaps driven by Left Void Peak’s meager rations. There, they encountered outsiders. Acai,” Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened, “soiled himself in terror, kowtowing thrice to beg mercy. When exposed, Xiang Shouzhuo sentenced them to thirty strikes and a year’s confinement. Yet here they stand after mere weeks. Elder Xiang, enlighten us.”

“Lies!” Acai shouted, face flushing. “We entered the woods, yes, but I never groveled!” Yet panic flickered – how could Guan Yu know details only Wenming witnessed?

“Would I invent such petty shame?” Guan Yu’s smirk chilled. “Two black-clad assailants advanced. You trembled, collapsed, struck your forehead thrice against earth. Did I err?”

Acai quivered, dignity crumbling under peers’ stares. Xiang Shouzhuo’s expression turned conflicted. “Guan Yu, why vilify my disciples? Our peaks bear no enmity.”

The elder sought damage control, but Guan Yu pressed on: “Elder Xiang remains ignorant? Let me elaborate. After abandoning Wenming in his flight, Acai fetched help. When rescuers arrived, only Wenming remained – restrained yet defiant. Admirable composure, Senior Brother Wenming. Do I speak true?”

Wenming remained stony. “Survival demands practicality. Should both have died?”

Ling Su seized the opening. “See? No admission! Why slander Left Void Peak?”

Guan Yu rounded on him. “Why insert yourself, Ling Su? Craving Senior Sister Siqi’s attention? Retire – tomorrow’s assembly demands rest.”

As Ling Su fumed, Guan Yu continued: “Wenming shields his junior’s cowardice, but truth persists. Acai, where lies your valor?”

“Fabrications!” Acai shrilled. “All lies!”

Xiang Shouzhuo’s suspicion grew – memories of that night aligning with Guan Yu’s account. “How came you by these details? Unless...”

“Ah, the crux!” Guan Yu smiled. “I witnessed it – from within those very woods.”

The elder’s eyes lit with triumph. “You admit trespassing forbidden grounds? Hypocrite!”

Ling Su revived, masking glee with faux dismay: “Oh Guan Yu! Knew you the prohibition yet entered? The master’s thirty strikes await!”

“Spare your crocodile tears,” Guan Yu scoffed. “I walked those woods with Senior Sister Siqi – by the master’s explicit permission. Check with him if you doubt.”

Xiang Shouzhuo’s vengeful momentum crumbled. Ling Su’s face mottled with humiliation. Whirling to Siqi, he pleaded, “He lies, yes?”

Stepping forward, Siqi’s voice rang clear: “Elder Uncle, Guan Yu speaks truth. Our passage had the master’s sanction.”

Murmurs swept the crowd. Guan Yu bowed. “My thanks for testifying, Senior Sister.”

Their courteous exchange – Siqi’s frosty demeanor thawing – ignited Ling Su’s fury. “You corrupt Siqi with your crimes!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Must flies persist where purity reigns? Swatting them grows tedious.”

To Xiang Shouzhuo, he added: “Your disciples require healing. Withdraw them – and perhaps enforce their due sentences this time.”

The elder trembled with rage. “Your impudence won’t go unpunished! I’ll petition the master tonight!”

As Xiang’s faction retreated, Guan Yu called after: “Confine those repeat offenders! Spare your reputation!”

The provocation snapped Xiang Shouzhuo’s restraint. Wheeling, he raised a quivering hand – yet wisdom stayed it. Striking a junior publicly would only shame himself further.

“Mark my words, whelp!” he thundered before storming off, disciples in tow.

Ling Su lingered, jealousy poisoning his gaze as Guan Yu and Siqi stood united. The night’s confrontation concluded – but its ripples would shape tomorrow’s storm.
