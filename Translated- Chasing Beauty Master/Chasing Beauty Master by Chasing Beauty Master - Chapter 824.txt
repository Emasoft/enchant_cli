“Pan Taisheng continued with lingering enthusiasm, 'Let me tell you, this restaurant just opened a few days ago. The night before last, I went with some friends for dinner. You wouldn't believe it—though the place isn't big, the proprietress is absolutely stunning! Just looking at her made my limbs go weak, utterly irresistible. And she seems to be Japanese too.'

Guan Yu chuckled, 'So you weren't really going for drinks but to see the proprietress, eh?' Though mocked, Pan Taisheng showed no embarrassment, still savoring the memory. 'That young madam... ah! Beautiful, gorgeous, youthful. We just went to drink at her place...'

Following Pan Taisheng to Xiaodan Restaurant, Guan Yu noticed the newly renovated interior with distinct Japanese decor. The color scheme harmonized perfectly, creating an immaculately clean environment.

A tender voice greeted them, 'Welcome! Are there two of you? Please choose a seat.' A graceful figure approached. Guan Yu turned to see a young beauty in her twenties walking over.

Dressed in a pink kimono that whetted the appetite, her natural makeup highlighted perfect features. A pearl necklace of ideal size adorned her fair neck beneath a delicate chin. The proprietress's attire and the decor combined to create a warm, homely atmosphere.

'This proprietress is extraordinary,' Guan Yu mused, impressed by her meticulous attention to both attire and interior design.

'Guan Yu, let's find a seat inside,' Pan Taisheng suggested.

As it wasn't yet peak dining hours, the restaurant remained sparsely populated with ample seating.

'Gentlemen, please come this way.' The proprietress extended her jade-like hand to guide them. Now Guan Yu understood Pan Taisheng's persistent praise—the woman truly lived up to her reputation.

After seating, the proprietress asked warmly, 'What dishes would you gentlemen like?' Emboldened by alcohol, Pan Taisheng's roaming eyes seemed intent on seeing through her clothes.

Guan Yu coughed pointedly before inquiring, 'What specialties do you offer here?'

'All our signature dishes are listed here.' She handed Guan Yu a menu card.

The specialties were divided into vegetarian and meat categories, each balancing light and rich options—thoughtfully curated for complete meals. Guan Yu ordered several highlighted dishes as Pan Taisheng remained distracted.

'Please wait a moment,' the proprietress said before leaving. Only when she disappeared from view did Pan Taisheng regain composure.

Smirking, Guan Yu remarked, 'Brother Pan, you seem rather pent up.'

Considering Pan Taisheng's unmarried status and playboy tendencies, this wasn't surprising. Guan Yu then phoned Qing Linger: 'Ling'er, join us at the new restaurant across the street if you haven't eaten.'

After some persuasion, Qing Linger arrived, exchanging pleasantries before sitting beside Guan Yu.

'Any health issues recently?' Guan Yu asked with concern.

'I've been perfectly fine,' she replied, maintaining their usual polite distance. Though appreciating his care, Qing Linger kept emotional barriers—uncomfortable with Guan Yu's wealth and multiple romantic entanglements.

When questioned about her father's whereabouts and the解毒 pill incident, Qing Linger revealed conflicting information about her family's relocation to the countryside for snake farming—a truth she'd concealed for safety reasons.

**Chapter 3011: The Secret Within**

As dishes arrived, the restaurant filled with patrons. Through liquor-laced conversation, Pan Taisheng expounded on his bachelor philosophy: 'Women complicate things! When needs arise, temporary arrangements suffice.'

Qing Linger blushed at his crude remarks while Guan Yu countered, 'But you can't stay single forever. Who'll care for you in old age?'

The discussion turned to Pan's unmarried sister Pan Xiaoxia's situation when sudden violence interrupted—the glass door shattered by three intruders led by a秃顶大汉 (balding man) wielding a machete.

Chaos erupted as patrons screamed. The秃顶大汉 and his henchmen stormed in, their motives unclear but threatening. Guan Yu's alcohol-fogged mind sharpened—this ordinary dinner had taken a dangerous turn. The proprietress stood frozen, her earlier composure shattered like the restaurant's entrance.
