Here is the translation:

“Seizing this chance, flee now!” Even as Poison Widow prepared to dash toward the holiday home’s back door, Jones closed in again. Jones’ attack came so swiftly that Poison Widow had no choice but dodge sideways.

At this moment, everyone paused. Poison Widow assessed the situation: Jones had cleverly positioned herself by the back door during the earlier assault. Having discerned Poison Widow’s intent to escape, Jones had preemptively blocked the exit, leaving her no path to retreat.

Poison Widow’s mind raced for an escape plan. Only two monks were present—the third had likely gone to deal with Fang Su and his son. Though aware of this, she could do nothing to intervene. Now, even her own life hung by a thread; saving the Fang father-son duo was beyond her power.

Muffled shouts echoed from outside, suggesting the external battlefield had grown livelier. Jones had no desire to waste time here. Eliminating this widow quickly to aid Guan Yu outside was paramount.

Jones shouted, “All three of us—attack together! Hold nothing back!”

Seeing no possibility of escape and knowing the odds were hopeless, Poison Widow resolved to fight desperately, clinging to the slim hope of finding an opening to flee.

Yet against Jones, Xiaobai, and Big Beard’s combined assault, Poison Widow might collapse within mere exchanges.

Just as the trio closed in to strike, a figure suddenly leaped down from upstairs. “Three against one? Shameless bastards…”

The newcomer landed beside Poison Widow precisely as Jones, Xiaobai, and Big Beard’s attacks arrived. In an instant, he deflected all three assaults unscathed, leaving Jones stunned. She retreated, steadying herself to grasp what had transpired.

Xiaobai and Big Beard understood—this was an expert. No ordinary person would dare block Big Beard’s iron staff head-on. One would need cultivation at least a full tier above his to attempt it. Yet this stranger had simultaneously countered three attackers while shielding both himself and Poison Widow.

Now standing beside Poison Widow was a diminutive old man—short, gaunt, wearing a pale blue medical mask and a baseball cap.

Jones studied him and recognized his attire—this was the same figure who’d attempted to assassinate Guan Yu at Qiaoyuan District’s gates, later injured by Second Only To Wolf. His reappearance here raised questions: Was he also under the Fang family’s employ?

Jones dismissed the thought. Had the Fangs possessed such an expert, they’d never have feared tonight’s invaders.

The newcomer was Luo Bo, a top subordinate of Bill Lin. Upon learning the Fang family’s dire straits, Bill Lin—who cared little for Fang Su beyond his monetary use—had initially planned to let Guan Yu eliminate him. Recent collaborations had proven Fang Su worthless anyway.

But hearing the Fang family had gained a formidable ally—Poison Widow, one of the Jianghu’s Ten Great Villains—Bill Lin changed tactics. Fang Su could die, but Poison Widow’s value demanded preservation.

Unwilling to confront Guan Yu’s forces directly, Bill Lin dispatched Luo Bo to extract her. His calculus was clear: rescuing Poison Widow from Guan Yu’s grasp would secure her loyalty, gaining a powerful ally against their mutual enemy.

Luo Bo had observed the battle from above. Initially assuming Poison Widow ordinary, he’d been surprised by her cultivation level. When the two monks joined the fray, nearly killing her, he intervened—leaping from the second floor to block the fatal strike.

Poison Widow eyed Luo Bo curiously. “Why save me?”

“Young Master Bill ordered your rescue. Is that strange?” Luo Bo replied flatly, gaze fixed on Jones—the greatest threat among them.

Jones wasn’t shocked—Fang Su’s alliance with Bill Lin against Guan Yu made this intervention predictable. Yet the enemy’s strength complicated matters. Even with Xiaobai and Big Beard, adding Luo Bo tilted the scales dangerously.

Poison Widow could match Jones alone. With Luo Bo’s aid, their side stood no chance. Xiaobai and Big Beard recognized the expert but not his true capabilities.

Catching Jones’ subtle head shake, Xiaobai signaled restraint.

“So Bill Lin meddles in Fang affairs again?” Jones projected confidence. “Hasn’t he suffered enough?”

“What’s one old man?” Big Beard growled. “My iron staff will crush him!”

In truth, Luo Bo’s left hand still tingled from blocking that staff earlier. The bearded man’s brute strength was formidable.

Jones contemplated escape over combat. Engaging would mean defeat, yet fleeing these two wouldn’t be easy.

Meanwhile, Poison Widow’s morale surged. “My thanks to Young Master Bill. Surviving this, I’ll repay his kindness.”

Luo Bo nodded—precisely the pledge he sought. “Let’s finish them. They’ve another member unaccounted for.”

As Poison Widow gathered energy to strike, Luo Bo gripped her arm. Though tempted to eliminate foes for greater rewards, her mention of an absent fighter—likely Second Only To Wolf—changed his mind. Still recovering from their last encounter, he couldn’t risk it.

“No need for pointless battle,” Luo Bo urged. “Our priority is your escape.”

Poison Widow acquiesced. Jones feigned relief—why would superior foes retreat? Unless Luo Bo feared Second Only To Wolf’s presence...

“Leaving won’t be simple,” Jones bluffed. “You think we’re alone here?”

The ploy worked. Seizing Poison Widow’s wrist, Luo Bo bolted through the back door with inhuman speed—vanishing before Xiaobai could blink.

“Why didn’t you stop them?!” Big Beard fumed.

“That old man’s no joke!” Xiaobai retorted. “Why didn’t you?”

“Too fast!”

“Enough!” Jones interjected. “Their departure spares us a losing battle.” She overestimated Luo Bo—his recovery was incomplete. Had they united against him sans Poison Widow, victory might’ve been possible. But with Second Only To Wolf’s specter hastening their retreat, the Fang residence now only held Fang Su.

“Find Fang Su. I’ll aid outside.” As Xiaobai and Big Beard nodded, Jones exited to find Xue Jing twisting Ah Gou’s arm with a sickening crunch. The defeated thug howled, rendered harmless.

Xue Jing rejoined Guan Yu as Jones approached through parting enemy ranks—none daring to strike.

“Your leader’s fled!” Jones announced to the crowd. “Persist here and die for nothing!”

Pandemonium ensued as Dark Sun members rushed inside, finding no trace of their mistress. The force dissolved into chaotic retreat.

“Bill Lin sent Luo Bo,” Jones reported to Guan Yu. “He took Poison Widow. We couldn’t stop him.”

“Luo Bo came?” Guan Yu frowned. “Did he harm Shen Sheng? Why aren’t they out?”

“They’re unhurt. He feared Second Only To Wolf might appear. Shen Sheng’s searching for Fang Su—”

“Found him!” Big Beard emerged, prodding Fang Su with his staff. A kick sent the man sprawling before Guan Yu.

“Bill Lin saved Poison Widow but abandoned you,” Guan Yu mused, pressing a Desert Eagle to Fang Su’s temple. “What use are you alive?”

“Wait! I’ll tell you Bill Lin’s secrets! I’ll give all my money—twenty million!”

“Only twenty million?” Guan Yu shoved the barrel harder. “Is your life so cheap?”

“More! There’s more!” Fang Su screamed as Shen Sheng dragged his shivering father from hiding—the old man stuffed inside a refrigerator.

“Now the set’s complete,” Guan Yu smiled. “Your son offered twenty million for his life. What’s both your lives worth?”

“Everything!” the patriarch stammered. “Take all we own! Just spare us!”

“Very well. I’ll have you transported far away. Beg or steal there—irrelevant. From now on, everything Fang owns is mine.”
