Guan Yu stared in astonishment as Feng Xin squatted down, her translucent figure becoming even more alluring. The momentary tension in her thighs caused subtle curves to accentuate further, as if swelling with the flexing of her muscles.

Licking his lips, Guan Yu smirked effortlessly, grabbing the 150-pound barbell and lifting it casually overhead. Even without using gravity manipulation tricks, two years of hauling sacks at docks during holidays had made such weights trivial.

Squatting and rising repeatedly, their eyes locked in silent contest. After fifty repetitions, Feng Xin's face flushed crimson while Guan Yu remained composed, watching her with amused detachment.

*This tomboy's face is truly exquisite,* he mused, noting how even her furious glare held charm. Beads of sweat glistened on her flushed cheeks, stirring an odd protectiveness in him.

Minutes later, Feng Xin's arms trembled and legs quivered uncontrollably. Guan Yu, still unperturbed, remarked lightly, "Enough, Xin-jie. This weight means nothing to me. Why strain yourself?"

His words provoked her. With a thud, she slammed her barbell down. "Add more! 200 pounds if you're so strong!"

"Don't be stubborn—" Guan Yu began, but Feng Xin was already loading plates.

*200 pounds? Damn, this woman's ferocious. Any man bedding her would need stamina,* he thought with dark humor.

As Feng Xin struggled to lift the new weight, veins bulged alarmingly across her pale skin. Her face drained of color. Guan Yu frowned—why push so recklessly?

"B-begin!" she hissed through clenched teeth.

With a roar, Guan Yu hoisted his barbell smoothly. Watching him, Feng Xin trembled with frustrated exhaustion. Each squat now resembled torture, their muscles screaming under combined weight and repetition.

Two minutes later, Feng Xin resembled a drowned creature—sweat cascading down trembling limbs, veins threatening to rupture. "Enough!" Guan Yu finally snapped, tossing his weights aside as she collapsed mid-squat.

He lunged forward as grotesque muscle knots erupted on her limbs—violent cramps from overexertion. Memories of dockworkers' injuries flashed through his mind. "Idiot!" he barked, yanking her upright.

Tears pooled in Feng Xin's defiant eyes as he massaged her spasming arms. "Why destroy yourself?" he chided, softer now.

"Don't... touch me!" she spat, though her protests weakened as his healing art eased the pain.

"Stubborn fool," he muttered, working down to her calves. "Must you always act so un-feminine?"

"None of your business!" She kicked his shoulder weakly.

Exhausted, Feng Xin eventually allowed herself to be guided to bed. Guan Yu fetched water, supporting her head as she drank. When liquid spilled down her neckline, he dabbed it hastily, flushing at the intimacy.

Downstairs, Old Master Feng sipped tea, smiling at their muffled arguments. His granddaughter's uncharacteristic compliance told him everything.

"Rest these days," Guan Yu instructed, kneeling to massage her feet. "No more recklessness."

"Don't care..." she pouted, turning away.

He wiped her sweaty face gently. Feng Xin flinched at his touch, cheeks burning. "I... can do it myself!"

Helping her upstairs, he noted her Spartan bedroom's lack of feminine touches—so like its owner.

"Not leaving yet," she demanded when he tried to depart. "Water."

As he held the cup to her lips, spilling droplets traced her collarbones. Apologizing, he blotted her chest, both avoiding each other's eyes.

Later, Guan Yu descended to his waiting master, unaware Feng Xin watched from her bed, biting her lip thoughtfully. The old man's knowing chuckle followed him into the training hall.
