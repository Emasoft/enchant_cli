Though Wang Jun's reasoning made sense, Guan Yu felt uneasy. After a moment's hesitation, Guan Yu said, "No, this way we'd be sending Liu Yun to her death."

Guan Yu continued, "At the government office, I already stated Liu Yun is a distant relative of Young Master Jiang's mother. If Magistrate Pang discovers our false identities now, he'll naturally doubt Liu Yun's claimed relation too. Do you think that scum Pang would spare her then?"

"You're right. This won't work," Wang Jun conceded. "If our deception is exposed, it would implicate both Liu Yun and Xiaoyuan. That vile Pang would never let Liu Yun off."

"Exactly," Guan Yu nodded. "Therefore, we must never reveal our true identities – that's the only way to ensure Liu Yun's safety. Unless... unless we eliminate Pang someday, our masks must remain."

Though somewhat confused, Liu Yun ventured, "Am I burdening you? Becoming your stumbling block? I know I'm not capable of much, but please tell me if there's any way I can help."

"Don't speak of yourself like that," Wang Jun said warmly. "You've already helped tremendously. Take tonight – without your assistance, the guards might have caught us. Thanks to you, Guan Yu and I could come and go safely."

Guan Yu added with a smile, "Indeed, this was crucial help. You remained composed and left no room for suspicion – performed excellently."

Flushed by their praise, Liu Yun demurred, "These were mere trifles. You overestimate my small efforts."

Growing pensive, Guan Yu realized their only potential ally might be Wang Xiaorong. "Tomorrow I must find way to contact Wang Xiaorong," he murmured.

Turning to Liu Yun, he asked, "As a local resident, do many martial artists pass through this area?"

"There used to be some," Liu Yun replied. "Not sure about recently, but when Xiaoyuan's father was alive, he often spoke of encountering jianghu wanderers during patrols. He'd mention seeing killings – not commoners or merchants involved – but officials never interfered. That's the office's rule."

Guan Yu's eyes lit up. "Good. Where there's jianghu activity, there's opportunity."

"What scheme are you brewing?" Wang Jun pressed. "Why seek martial artists? Didn't we agree to hide our identities?"

"Our masks stay on," Guan Yu countered, "but contacting jianghu isn't forbidden. Since we bid farewell to Pang tomorrow, we'll need their help spreading news quickly – especially Demon Soul Sect members. Information travels fastest through their networks."

Wang Jun's brow furrowed. "You mean to involve Wang Xiaorong? Have her leak information about your whereabouts?"

"Precisely," Guan Yu confirmed. "Once higher authorities investigate Pang, we'll secretly provide evidence and prisoner locations. Pang's fate will be sealed."

Wang Jun slammed the table excitedly. "Brilliant! This might work. It's late – should we return now?"

Nodding, Guan Yu said, "Let's go. The guards should be asleep by now."

As they prepared to leave, Liu Yun fretted until Guan Yu reassured her. The pair then theatrically boarded their carriage under armed escort, maintaining their charade.

Back at the government compound, Magistrate Pang awaited anxiously. Though exhausted, the eighth-rank official dared not retire before his superior's return. At the guard's announcement, Pang jerked awake from his chair, plastering on an obsequious smile as he rushed to greet them.

"Welcome back, Young Master Jiang! How fares Madam Liu?" Pang oozed false concern. "After her husband's tragic death, I've frequently sent envoys to comfort her."

Guan Yu maintained the facade. "My apologies for keeping you waiting. Liu Yun manages adequately. After consulting my family, I may relocate them to Qujiang City's magistrate residence."

Pang's grin tightened. "Splendid! They'll find proper shelter there." Internally, he seethed: Damn connections! Now I must tell Li to abandon plans for that woman and her daughter.

The truth festered – Pang himself had orchestrated Liu Yun's husband's murder. It began when Young Master Li coveted their eldest daughter. After the girl resisted assault, Li killed her. When the husband uncovered trafficking operations while searching for his daughter, Pang and Li framed his death as bandit casualty.

Now eyeing the younger daughter, Pang hesitated. Though complicit in human trafficking, even his corroded conscience balked at destroying the last remnant of Liu's family. Moreover, the fiery younger daughter promised more trouble than profit.

Feigning weariness, Guan Yu announced, "Magistrate Pang, I'll retire now. We depart at dawn."

Pang's relief was palpable. "So soon? Might Your Honor prolong your stay?"

"Since you insist so earnestly," Guan Yu feigned consideration, "perhaps we'll linger longer."

Panicked, Pang backtracked: "Of course, Your schedule dictates! This humble official wouldn't presume..."

Chuckling, Guan Yu relented. "I jest. We leave tomorrow. However..." His tone sharpened. "I trust you'll care for Liu Yun's family post our departure. A widow and child deserve protection."

"Absolutely!" Pang thumped his chest. "As my former subordinate's kin, they'll want for nothing."

"Speaking of which," Guan Yu casually probed, "how exactly did her husband perish?"

Pang's jowls quivered. "A... bandit ambush during patrol. Tragic affair – we lost ten men that day." He dabbed imaginary tears. "Even failed to recover his body."

Guan Yu's gaze turned steely. "Yet no bereavement stipend reached them. Explain this negligence, Magistrate."

Wang Jun chimed in: "They live in squalor! Where's the compensation mandated for fallen officers' families?"

Pang's face drained of color. The game was afoot.
