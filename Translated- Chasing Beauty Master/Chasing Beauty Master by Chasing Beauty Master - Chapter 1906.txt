Now, even the harshest curses would be futile, and venting anger would do no good. Though Master Qin was equally furious, he clearly grasped the gravity of the situation.

If they failed to satisfy the bandits’ silver demands, those outlaws would care little about consequences. If they truly dragged Chu Fan to the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence, even without obtaining silver, the Qin family’s secrets would be exposed, leading to catastrophic trouble.

Facing the Imperial Princess and Jiang Yuankai afterward was an outcome Master Qin absolutely wished to avoid. He’d rather deal with a few bandits now—a far simpler predicament.

Master Qin declared, “Very well. This time, our Qin family has fallen into your hands. However, ten thousand taels is no small sum. Though our family possesses it, we require time to gather the funds. The remaining hours before dawn are insufficient, and our accountants have retired. Could you grant us one more day? I swear to deliver the silver by tomorrow night.”

“Father, why yield to their bluffing?” Qin Huan interjected urgently. “Even if we hand Chu Fan over—what of it? He’s merely an actor! Killing him would change nothing!”

“Huan’er, this matter is extraordinary. We cannot act rashly,” Master Qin replied. “Since we engaged these men, we must trust them to resolve this. We’ll simply spend more silver.”

The bearded bandit sneered, “A great house like the Qin family can’t produce ten thousand taels immediately? Needing a day to gather funds? Who would believe such nonsense?”

“Even large families require liquidity. We cannot produce such an amount on such short notice,” Master Qin implored earnestly. “Do you doubt my word? Grant me one more day, and I vow to deliver every tael. I stake my life and honor as Master Qin on this pledge.”

The bearded man pursed his lips. An extra day mattered little—with hostages in hand, the Qins couldn’t scheme their way out. “Fine. Considering your sincerity, I’ll grant a day’s reprieve. But heed this: if the silver isn’t delivered by midnight tomorrow, the hostage will appear at the Imperial Son-in-Law’s gates. Don’t blame me for the consequences.” His voice turned icy.

“Agreed. I’ll ensure the silver arrives by tomorrow night,” Master Qin rose, adding, “But you must promise me one condition.”

“Speak. For silver’s sake, I’ll grant one more favor,” the bearded man replied, tilting his head arrogantly.

“Once you receive the silver tomorrow, kill Chu Fan,” Master Qin commanded coldly.

**Chapter 5009: Betrayal of Conscience**

Guan Yu, eavesdropping from the roof, stiffened. Were the Qins reneging? Ordering Chu Fan’s death after payment—did they abandon plans to extort the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl from Jiang Xin?

Perhaps Master Qin realized Chu Fan held no real influence. Even if Jiang Xin wished to help, the Imperial Princess and Jiang Yuankai would never surrender the treasure. Eliminating Chu Fan would silence the threat permanently.

Alternatively, the Qin patriarch recognized Chu Fan as an endless liability. With the dragon pearl unattainable and bandits extorting them perpetually, killing the actor became the pragmatic choice.

The bearded bandit feared nothing from Master Qin—a barefoot man unafraid of those wearing shoes. Though the Qins held power, their secret now rested in his hands, rendering them powerless against him.

Earlier, he’d warned that if he failed to return safely by dawn, his men would deliver the hostage to authorities or the Imperial Son-in-Law’s household, exposing the Qins’ schemes. While a mere actor’s fate mattered little, the Qin family’s reputation would crumble, inviting Princess Jiang Xin’s wrath—a formidable opponent when provoked.

Yet the Qins’ lack of immediate payment displeased him. This extortion arose from calculated opportunism. Initially negotiated at five hundred taels for kidnapping, the bandit now deemed that sum insultingly low for such a wealthy house. Seizing this chance to bleed the Qins dry felt like ancestral duty.

Thus, he’d stormed into Master Qin’s chambers demanding ten thousand taels. To his satisfaction, the patriarch acquiesced swiftly, though the delay rankled.

As for killing the hostage? To the bandit, murder was routine. “Once we receive the silver tomorrow, the hostage dies,” he vowed. “We’ll vanish from the rivers and lakes forever. Your investment won’t be wasted.” Empty promises, perhaps, but Master Qin had no choice but to nod.

“Prepare the silver by dawn,” he instructed.

From the rooftop, Guan Yu marveled at the bandit’s audacity. Ten thousand taels could sustain a common family for lifetimes. Were it him, he’d demand a hundred thousand.

Chuckling, the bandit departed, escorted out by Qin Huan. Guan Yu considered pursuit but lingered upon Huan’s return.

Qin Huan stormed back, face dark. “Father, why submit to their threats? Since when do we fear mountain bandits? This humiliation burns!”

“Calm yourself, Huan’er. This is but a delaying tactic,” Master Qin countered grimly. “Even if we pay, will they live to spend it?”

“Your meaning…?”

“Tomorrow, we’ll send men to their hideout with the silver. After they kill Chu Fan, we’ll ambush them. Reclaim the silver, capture the bandits, and deliver them to the magistrate. We’ll earn merit—perhaps even gratitude from Princess Jiang Xin.”

“Brilliant!” Qin Huan’s eyes glinted. “Those insolent dogs will pay! They’ll return every stolen tael—even the initial five hundred!”

Yet doubt surfaced. “But killing Chu Fan ruins our plans. Wasn’t he meant to secure the dragon pearl?”

Master Qin sighed. “Observe the capital. Despite Chu Fan’s fame, his disappearance caused no stir. His influence is negligible. Though Jiang Xin frets, Jiang Yuankai would never trade the treasure for an actor. Our scheme was flawed from the start. Eliminating him removes a liability.”

Qin Huan conceded. Chu Fan’s value lay solely with Jiang Xin, who lacked authority over the pearl. “Then let’s slaughter both bandits and actor tomorrow. No loose ends.”

**Chapter 5010: Silver Turns Millstones**

“No need for concern—mere bandits,” Master Qin assured. “The magistrate longs to execute these marauders. By delivering them, we gain credit. Their ravings won’t be believed. A double victory.”

“Exquisite!” Qin Huan grinned. “We lose nothing! We reclaim silver, earn praise, and Jiang Xin might thank us for burying her lover.” Ambition flickered—perhaps this tragedy could forge ties with the imperial family.

“But Father, these bandits are skilled fighters. We must proceed cautiously.”

“Fear not. My guards are capable. We’ll overwhelm them with numbers. Moreover…” Master Qin’s voice lowered conspiratorially. “We’ll gift them poisoned wine—a ‘reward’ for their service. Whether they drink or not, we’ll strike.”

Qin Huan’s chuckle turned venomous. “Qin wine comes steeply priced—in lives.”

Listening above, Guan Yu seethed. These Qins surpassed bandits in treachery. That such vipers thrived in the capital revealed the court’s rot.

As father and son plotted further, Guan Yu slipped away, tracking the bearded bandit through moonlit streets.

The man ambled cheerfully, broadsword slung over shoulder, whistling a tune. Guan Yu materialized before him like a specter.

“Who goes there?!” The bandit brandished his blade. Moonlight revealed Guan Yu’s shadow—a living man, not ghost.

“Cease your theatrics!” the bandit barked. “State your business!”

“You should flee toward the city gates,” Guan Yu remarked. “Yet here you wander.”

“None of your concern! Scram, lest I cleave you!”

Guan Yu taunted, “Your ‘important matter’ tomorrow is dying. Let me expedite it.”

Enraged, the bandit swung—but struck only cobblestones. Guan Yu reappeared behind him. “Too slow.”

Panicked, the bandit hurled silver ingots skyward. “Free silver!” he bellowed, fleeing. Guan Yu let him run.

Crouching breathless in an alley, the bandit congratulated himself. “Money soothes all troubles! That ghost chose silver over pursuit!”

A voice answered, “Your silver lies untouched.”

Before him stood Guan Yu, having materialized silently. The bandit paled. “Who are you? What grudge do we hold?”

“None. I bring a warning: the Qins plan to slaughter you tomorrow after payment.”

The bandit scoffed. “Lies! They wouldn’t dare!”

“They’ll poison your wine or ambush you. Either way, you die. Cooperate, and perhaps survive.”

Sweating, the bandit weighed his options. Against Guan Yu’s preternatural speed, resistance was futile. “What do you propose?”

“A counterplot. Deliver Chu Fan to me tonight. Tomorrow, take the Qins’ silver—then vanish. I’ll ensure their ambush fails.”

“And why trust you?”

Guan Yu’s blade flashed, severing a nearby stone pillar. “Because refusing means death tonight.”

The bandit swallowed. “A-alright. Let’s talk…”
