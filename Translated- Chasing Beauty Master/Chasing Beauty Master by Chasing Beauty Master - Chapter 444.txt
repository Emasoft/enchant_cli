“From the various signs revealed so far, these individuals are undoubtedly cultivators. What I don’t understand is why they would abduct Miss Zhou!”

“What else could it be? They’re after the Qi Gathering Pills!” Guan Yu scoffed. Aside from the pills, what could possibly draw cultivators’ attention to an ordinary girl like Zhou Xiaoyou? He’d once believed cultivators were transcendent beings, but it seemed they were just as base as ordinary folk.

“If that’s truly the case, we’re in trouble!” Wan Qingyang sighed. With only five days left until pill completion, the consequences of not finding Zhou Xiaoyou in time were unthinkable.

“Wasn’t there a rule forbidding the cultivation world from interfering with the mortal realm? Where are the enforcers?” Zhou Xiaochuan demanded coldly.

Wan Qingyang shook his head. “The pact between realms was established by ancient sages and upheld by all sects, with respected enforcers appointed to maintain it. But the world has changed. Enforcers vanished long ago, and worse—we don’t even know our adversaries’ origins.”

The old agreement now hung by a thread. As mortals prospered, cultivators found it harder to resist worldly temptations. Many had already tested the boundaries by settling in cities and starting families. Clever ones used minor spells to manipulate wealthy patrons—even Qingyang Sect had once employed Zhang Dafa. Such transgressions went unpunished unless they caused major disruptions.

Zhou Xiaoyou’s abduction blatantly violated the pact, but without enforcers, justice relied solely on individual conscience. With major sects eyeing Hongcheng for expansion, Wan Qingyang doubted any would intervene beyond empty condemnations.

“Do these people have no regard for laws?!” Zhou Xiaochuan slammed the table, rising angrily.

Guan Yu snorted. “Laws? Do you think the Dragon Group cares about laws?”

“Elder Zhou, these individuals exist beyond mortal laws. In their eyes, they’re no longer ordinary humans...”

The truth hung heavy—cultivators operated in a separate reality. Slumping back into his chair, Zhou Xiaochuan murmured, “Is there truly no solution?” His earlier plan to borrow Dragon Group operatives now seemed laughably inadequate against what might be an entire cultivation faction.

“I’ll contact old acquaintances for leads,” Wan Qingyang decided. With time short, they resolved to visit White Cloud Temple and request Master Yehe to issue a Cultivation Decree—an ancient communication method passed verbally between cultivators. As temple abbot and Taoist Association leader, Yehe’s authority could mobilize the community.

Leaving their异能 (supernatural) escorts at Zhou Manor, the duo departed. The guards’ displeasure was palpable—Guan Yu suspected they’d hoped to observe cultivation affairs... or him.

Master Yehe, despite his ninety years, radiated vitality beneath snow-white hair. Guan Yu raised an eyebrow finding the venerable leader interpreting fortune sticks for devotees.

“How can one dwell in the mortal realm yet ignore its affairs?” Yehe chuckled, sensing Guan Yu’s thoughts. “This too is cultivation.” Leading them through a cluttered storage area, the master waved his sleeve. Mist parted to reveal a majestic bridge leading to White Cloud Temple’s true sanctum—a vast plaza filled with meditating disciples beneath a towering hall inscribed “White Cloud Temple.”

Guan Yu marveled at the hidden splendor. “No wonder cultivators yearn to return to the world—living like this must be stifling.”

After hearing their plea, Yehe stroked his beard. “I’ll issue the decree, but hold little hope for results. The cultivation world grows unstable...”

He recounted recent troubles: The millennia-old pact had weakened as enforcers disappeared. During past national turmoil, cultivators had intervened despite the rules—yet faced no consequences. Now, as China prospered, secluded sects grew restless. A minor sect recently tried establishing an urban foothold before being crushed by Dragon Group.

More alarmingly, young women nationwide were vanishing—all prime candidates as cauldrons for refining Qi Gathering Pills. “Similar to Zhou Xiaoyou’s case,” Guan Yu noted grimly.

Yehe nodded. “Witnesses reported figures flying overhead. My investigation confirmed the victims’ suitability as human cauldrons. The perpetrators bear inverted crosses—a mark I discovered through the taxing Cycle Reincarnation Art.”

“An inverted cross? Like Zhang Dafa’s?” Guan Yu recalled their former ally’s symbol.

“You’ve seen this?” Yehe leaned forward.

“The instigator called Ah Fa bore this mark. His infiltration of Qingyang Sect was no accident.” Realization dawned—Ah Fa had been a plant.

Rushing back, they found Ah Fa awaiting them. “I know why you’re here,” the man said calmly. “But I’ll share nothing. A dying man has no reason to lie.”

Guan Yu recognized the deathly pallor of one cursed. “They used Heart Demon Oaths,” Ah Fa explained. “The ‘defective’ Qi Gathering Pills I took carried dying cauldrons’ curses. Now, speaking of them means death.”

As Ah Fa convulsed and died, Wan Qingyang paled. “Only the Demonic Sect could modify such ancient curses.”

The Demonic Sect—founded by Chi You in his war against the Yellow Emperor—resurfaced every millennium. “The thousand-year cycle begins anew,” Wan Qingyang murmured.

At White Cloud Temple, Yehe confirmed their fears. “With the Demonic Sect’s return, chaos looms. But finding their lair is impossible unless they reveal themselves.”

Just as despair set in, the Dragon Group operatives spoke: “We have Demonic Sect intel.”

Under national efforts, Dragon Group had mapped the sect’s hideouts. A recent raid discovered a southern base, deemed too dangerous to assault. Their earlier approach to Guan Yu had been rebuffed due to arrogance.

“If you want to save Zhou Xiaoyou,” they challenged, “beg Dragon Group for the files.”

Though suspecting humiliation, Guan Yu agreed. Following operatives Eagle and Tiger, he arrived at Dragon Group’s headquarters—a dilapidated compound belying its formidable reputation.

“This is Dragon Group’s base?!” Guan Yu stared in disbelief. The nation’s premier supernatural force operated from this ruin?
