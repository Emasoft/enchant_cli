If Guan Yu were to race this car, the vast majority would bet on him to win—these people knew nothing about cars. Precisely because of their ignorance, their faith lay not in the driver's skill but in the vehicle itself.

Yet the Haomen's experts, true connoisseurs of automobiles, would immediately recognize this car’s unsuitability for mountain pass racing. They’d dismiss Guan Yu as just another thrill-seeking rich kid, lulling them into complacency: *Such a car could never win.*

Thus, no matter how many bets poured in for Guan Yu, the Haomen would greedily swallow them all—only to hemorrhage losses later!

Especially since Guan Yu had infiltrated their ranks with his own agents, wagering colossal sums on his victory.

How could the Haomen *not* be bankrupted?

All this hinged on Guan Yu’s unshakable confidence in victory—a certainty Lin Dong never doubted.

After piecing together the scheme, Lin Dong offered his verdict: “You’re truly a cunning, despicable scoundrel. Even your traps are masterpieces of ruthlessness!”

“……”

*A warrior prefers death to humiliation!*

But since humiliation had already struck, there was no recourse.

Guan Yu had no intention of being pummeled by Lin Dong before the race. Channeling his fury into vivid fantasies, he mentally throttled Lin Dong until satisfaction washed over him.

Rolling his eyes, Guan Yu retorted, “You’ve got nerve criticizing me! I’m just openly flashy—*you’re* the closeted drama queen!”

He labeled Lin Dong “closeted” because during their planning, Guan Yu had wanted him to join the race, making it easier to eliminate the three Haomen drivers. Lin Dong refused, claiming it would “save Guan Yu money.”

His exact words: “The roads aren’t owned by the Haomen. Sneaking a car in is child’s play.”

More crucially, he proposed ambushing the Haomen mid-race as insurance against Guan Yu’s potential failure. When first hearing this, Guan Yu had deemed it peak passive-aggression: *“Easier to dodge a spear than a hidden dagger!”*

“Five slots. Three go to Haomen’s picks. You take one. What about the last? Collateral damage?” Lin Dong suddenly interjected.

As a former assassin with principles, he never harmed innocents—past or present.

Knowing this, Guan Yu chuckled. “Not only will no one be hurt, I’ll ensure that fifth driver reaches the finish line unscathed.”

“Because… he’ll be the eyewitness to the ‘accidents’ befalling the other three. If *he* dies, I’m in deep trouble.”

Lin Dong sighed melodramatically. “How does a brat your age obsess over scheming? Your childhood must’ve been loveless!”

“……”

Guan Yu’s fists clenched, glaring daggers.

Lin Dong’s barb signaled tacit approval of the plan—yet old habits compelled him to mock anyway.

*Understanding is supreme,* they say.

Guan Yu understood, but lived by the moment.

And right now? He needed to vent.

“*You’re* the loveless one!” he roared.

Unfazed, Lin Dong dug at his ear, stretched lazily, and settled deeper into the sofa. “When darkness falls, mischief thrives. For now… conserve your energy.”

With that, he abandoned Guan Yu to stew alone, drifting into sleep.

Cigarette smoke veiled Guan Yu’s face as he pondered the high-stakes night ahead.

**Chapter 944: The High-Stakes Gamble (Part 2)**

Life is a gamble.

Silently, Guan Yu set his trap—a meticulously crafted wager poised to ensnare the Haomen.

As the hour approached, he arrived at Kyoto’s mountainous outskirts in a flamboyant Ferrari, the designated racetrack thrumming with energy.

Through connections and hefty bribes, he’d infiltrated the venue undetected. The crowd’s frenzy astonished him: the once-deserted pass now teemed with shadowy figures, their faces obscured but voices thunderous.

Initially puzzled by their fervor, Guan Yu understood upon spotting the three luxury cars ahead—each surrounded by admirers.

*So this event draws both gamblers and groupies.*

His supercar’s arrival intensified the madness. A million-dollar machine here was unprecedented.

“Look! That car’s ridiculously flashy!”

“Idiot! That’s a ten-million-yuan ride! Where’d this guy crawl from?”

“Using that here? He’s insane!”

“Rich folks live in another dimension. Let’s bet—I’m backing Mr. Moneybags!”

Overhearing this, Guan Yu swelled with pride, a sly grin creeping in.

As predicted, most spectators judged by price tags alone. His car’s debut instantly shifted bets, sparking bedlam.

Amid the uproar, three gazes locked onto Guan Yu—the Haomen’s drivers.

Central among them stood Wu Haojian, the Haomen’s ace racer behind the Maybach. Undefeated without Haomen’s rigging, he drew fanatics.

Guan Yu had come to end Wu’s reign.

The other two—Zhao Xing and Wu Zijun—were elite drivers fattening Haomen’s coffers. All three now eyed Guan Yu with open derision.

Though his car outclassed theirs, its design doomed it on these treacherous curves. Dismissing him, they retreated to their vehicles.

Relieved they hadn’t seen through him, Guan Yu tensed when a voice cut through:

“Damn, buddy! Thought my ride was flashy, but you’ve outdone me. Boring!”

A young wastrel resembling Xu Yuan leaned against a rare Maybach—world-class, yet dwarfed by Guan Yu’s machine.

Understanding such egos, Guan Yu patted his shoulder. “I’ll make you the star. Trust me.”

Leaving the baffled man, Guan Yu entered his car as bets skyrocketed outside.

**Haomen Headquarters**

The commotion reached the inner circle. Huang Zhongxing reported: “Yu-ge, a ten-million-yuan car’s drawn sixty million in bets—still climbing.”

*Seventy million?*

The table buzzed. Previous peaks hit thirty million. This promised unprecedented numbers.

“Who owns that car?” asked Li Yu, sole calm figure.

“A military brat seeking thrills. Paid a million just to enter anonymously,” Huang answered.

“Which family?”

“Unknown. His agent—a crew-cut man—paid cash and vanished. Untraceable.”

**Chapter 945: Flashy Car, Flashy Man**

“No face-to-face?” Li Yu pressed.

“None. The agent disappeared after payment.”

“Investigate him!”

“Tried. No records exist—like a ghost.”

Advisor Chang Qing interjected: “Special forces. Their identities get erased.”

After deliberation, Li Yu ordered: “Make him lose. ‘Accidents’ permitted.”

To Huang: “Have Zhao and Wu tail him. Eliminate if needed.”

To Chang: “Accept all bets. Set odds 1:3.”

Chang protested: “Such high odds risk—”

Li Yu smirked. “The winner’s ours. Higher odds bait bigger fish. Their money becomes *our* money.”

Chang grinned, awed by the ruthlessness.

**Race Track**

Five cars growled at the starting line. Guan Yu’s phone rang:

“Li Yu’s swallowing all bets.”

“Add twenty million more,” Guan Yu replied coolly.

The trap was set.

As the flag dropped, four cars rocketed forward—except Guan Yu’s.

He revved thunderously but stayed put, drawing collective disbelief.

“Is this poser serious? Go already!”

Amid curses from betrayed bettors, Guan Yu’s smirk deepened. The real game had just begun.
