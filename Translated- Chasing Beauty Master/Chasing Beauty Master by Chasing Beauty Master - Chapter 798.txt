“The later this day comes, the better. Time can dilute everything, including people’s tempers,” Guan Yu reminded.

Qing Guanghui acknowledged that he understood this principle, but worried his junior sister might not.

With nothing left to discuss, Guan Yu bid farewell to Qing Guanghui. Before heading home, he decided to call first. “Hey, Ah Mei? I didn’t come home last night. Did Jingjing sister throw a fit?”

This was a tactic Guan Yu had recently adopted. Whenever he anticipated scolding, he would call Ah Mei first to gauge the mood. Ah Mei always sided with him. If Xue Jing showed signs of erupting, Guan Yu could prepare countermeasures in advance.

“Yes! This morning, Jingjing sister kept cursing you nonstop,” Ah Mei whispered, as if fearing someone nearby might overhear.

Zhang Han tiptoed behind Ah Mei, then suddenly yelled into the phone, “Brother-in-law! Hurry back! I’m so bored I could die—”

Her roar startled Ah Mei nearly out of her wits. Hearing Zhang Han’s voice, Guan Yu promptly hung up.

Now resolved, Guan Yu decided to first buy a pile of snacks for Zhang Han, then select intimate apparel for the three beauties to placate them—especially Xue Jing, whom he needed to spoil extra.

**Chapter 2024: Gifts for Each**

Zhang Han’s roar as she snatched the phone nearly scared Ah Mei’s soul from her body.

Guan Yu hung up immediately, unwilling to endure the little tyrant’s nagging.

His plan solidified: snacks for Zhang Han, lingerie for the ladies—Xue Jing required the most attention.

At the mall, Guan Yu browsed selections aligned with his tastes. Attendants politely showcased various styles. Men buying intimate wear for women had become increasingly common, even fashionable.

Returning home, Guan Yu wasted no time. He produced Zhang Han’s mountain of snacks and called out, “Jingjing! Come see the gifts I bought! There’s something for everyone!”

The tactic worked. Xue Jing’s urge to scold evaporated as she dragged Ah Mei over excitedly.

Zhang Han’s complaints vanished at the sight of snacks. “Brother-in-law, you’re the best! You even got my favorite BY brand milk powder!”

Guan Yu knew Zhang Han, still unweaned, adored this particular brand. Her milk-heavy diet perhaps contributed to her milky-white skin. Today’s two bulk packs delighted her beyond measure.

“This is yours… and yours…” Guan Yu distributed gifts, carefully matching sizes to each woman’s measurements to ensure proper fit.

Each received two lingerie sets. Zhang Han, boasting the largest bust, excitedly tore open her package—a playful panda-themed set with ear-shaped accents. Without hesitation, she shed her robe, revealing her nude form before slipping into the new attire.

“Perfect fit!” She twirled before Guan Yu. “How do I look, brother-in-law?”

“Lovely,” Guan Yu replied, though his usual ardor was tempered by last night’s excesses. Under normal circumstances, her boldness would’ve provoked more spirited reactions.

Ah Mei noted with surprise that Guan Yu had correctly guessed her size—a testament to their nocturnal intimacies.

Xue Jing, petite and slender, blushed at her modest-sized gift. Envious glances at Zhang Han’s ample curves sent her scurrying to her room with her present.

A small price to avoid a scolding. Pleased with the happy faces around him, Guan Yu relaxed.

This being his first gift-giving gesture, the women treasured the intimate apparel all the more. “Brother-in-law’s choices are amazing! So comfortable!” Zhang Han bounced barefoot on the sofa.

Ah Mei resisted trying hers immediately, saving it for evening. For now, dinner preparations called.

With Xue Jing pacified, the crisis passed.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei heeded Guan Yu’s warning to lay low amidst Li Yuan and Ma Hai’s threats. The obedient youth even avoided girlfriend Qian Yaoyao, adhering strictly to school-home routine.

Come weekend, Wei planned an outing with Qian Yaoyao but sought Guan Yu’s approval. “Bringing her out might be risky,” Guan Yu cautioned, then reconsidered. “I’ll join you with Lü Mei.”

“Perfect! With you guarding us, we’re safe!” Wei cheered.

Hanging up, Zhang Han sidled over. “Where are you going? Take me! I’ve been so good lately!”

“No,” Guan Yu flatly refused. One companion complicated matters enough. Lü Mei’s inclusion made sense—she was Qian Yaoyao’s close friend and classmate. A single charge allowed easier protection.

After informing Lü Mei (thrilled by the rare attention), Guan Yu hit the mall again, buying lingerie for Lü Mei, Lan Yu, Jones, and Yang Conghan. Only Jones’s size gave pause, but confidence guided his choice.

Delivering gifts late into the night, he declined Lan Yu’s invitation to stay, citing other deliveries.

**Chapter 2025: The Unshaven Men**

Next morning, Wei arrived with Qian Yaoyao at Lü Mei’s home. Ready early, they awaited Guan Yu.

“Where to?” Guan Yu asked upon arrival.

“Golden Beach’s seaside and the ancient city—two hours’ drive,” Wei announced.

They piled into Guan Yu’s van, Lü Mei’s mother Ms. Yao inviting him inside briefly before being shooed away by her impatient daughter.

The drive passed with chatter between the women. Golden Beach, a renowned tourist destination, boasted golden sands under sunset and an expansive Yuan-dynasty prince’s palatial estate.

Securing rooms at the LanGui Hotel near the beach, they prepared for evening sightseeing. First, lunch at a bustling sushi spot drew them in.

A hostess greeted them: “One four-seat table remains.” She indicated an inner table—promptly claimed by three brash men who barged in.

“We reserved that!” Qian Yaoyao protested.

“Seats belong to whoever sits first!” retorted a bearded man, leering.

Choosing peace, Guan Yu accepted a private room upstairs—only for the men to harass them again.

“This room’s ours! Scram!” the bearded one demanded.

Yielding once more, Guan Yu’s group descended—only to find the other two troublemakers still occupying downstairs seats.

“Why aren’t you upstairs?” the hostess asked.

“Who said we’re moving?” the fat one sneered, ogling Lü Mei.

As the manager intervened, the men escalated threats. Guan Yu’s patience wore thin—trouble had found them despite precautions.

**Chapter 2026: Judging Books by Covers**

The sushi manager, a foreigner in his fifties, pleaded: “Gentlemen, please don’t disrupt our business.”

“Screw your business!” the fat man barked. “You’re already pissing me off!”

Lü Mei bristled under the man’s lecherous gaze. Guan Yu steadied her with a look.

“Come sit on my lap, sweetheart,” the fat man propositioned.

The manager’s diplomatic efforts failed. Guan Yu observed quietly, weighing options. These thugs sought confrontation—but he’d ensure it cost them dearly.
