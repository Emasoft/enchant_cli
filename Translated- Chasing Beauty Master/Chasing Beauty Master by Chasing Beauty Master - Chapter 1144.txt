“I’ve considered all this,” said Jia Bo. “My idea is to remove all the useless personnel and keep those requiring technical skills. We’ll urgently train new recruits so that by the time Ge Yinglai returns, we’ll have learned enough to replace all his old subordinates. If that still doesn’t work, Boss, don’t you have that friend Hou Jinshun? As the club manager, he must understand these matters well. If necessary, borrowing some of his people would still be far better than relying on Ge Yinglai’s crew.”

Guanyu found Jia Bo’s reasoning sound. For safety’s sake, it was best to remove all of Ge Yinglai’s people to eliminate any vulnerabilities. “Alright, proceed as you’ve suggested. You handle the new recruits. I’ll notify Hou Jinshun in advance.”

Guanyu understood Jia Bo’s ulterior motive—to install his own men. Though the bar and wellness club appeared ordinary, they generated substantial hidden profits. Many of Jia Bo’s idle followers loitered around society with nothing to do. Getting them settled in these establishments with steady wages and perks would secure their livelihoods. Moreover, all Yu Gang members coveted these positions for their lucrative side income. Jia Bo had accepted numerous bribes from underlings to propose this arrangement, never expecting Guanyu to agree so readily.

Though aware of Jia Bo’s calculations, Guanyu thought: *They’re all brothers. Using his men makes no difference.* Another layer was Jia Bo’s desire to elevate his status within the Yu Gang. Currently, Wang Hu managed the leather factory with a manager’s salary, while Wei Hongwei oversaw daily gang affairs, commanding most incense masters. Jia Bo had been stationed outside Kaihuang Academy to monitor Yu Gang members protecting Qu Shuangshuang. Feeling underutilized, Jia Bo seized this opportunity. If managerial positions opened at the bar or wellness club, he might rise to become a salaried figurehead like Wang Hu—a cushy job “not found even with lanterns.”

Jia Bo pressed, “Boss, the bar’s manager position remains vacant. Though business is slow, shouldn’t we have someone overseeing operations?”

His meaning became clear. *Everyone has roles except him,* Guanyu mused. Trusting Jia Bo was unquestionable—he and Wei Hongwei had been Guanyu’s closest allies since school days, instrumental in building the Yu Gang’s current influence.

“You’ll take the bar manager role,” Guanyu decided. “But no more skirt-chasing on duty. Earn your keep—I won’t pay for nothing.”

“Thank you, Boss!” Jia Bo grinned. “How much will my salary be?”

Wei Hongwei smiled at his friend’s fortune. Unlike Jia Bo, Wei came from wealth, drove luxury cars, and had a rich girlfriend. Jia Bo, perpetually broke, had recently received an Audi and bonuses from gang funds, but his spendthrift habits left him nearly penniless—even gas money ran low. This managerial position meant survival.

“Congrats, Manager!” Wei clapped Jia Bo’s shoulder. “Now you’re legit!”

Jia Bo patted his empty pockets dramatically. “You’re set for life, Young Master Wei, but I need cash to impress girls. No money, no honey!”

“With your Yu Gang hallmaster status, girls should flock to you!” Wei teased.

“Cut the crap!” Jia Bo grimaced. “Even the Jade Emperor needs gold. Modern girls want cash.”

Guanyu suddenly interjected, “Weren’t you dating Xie Yulu? What happened?”

Xue Jing pinched Guanyu’s arm, stopping him from mentioning their office tryst. Guanyu rephrased: “You two were close. Where is she now?”

Jia Bo’s face darkened. Xie Yulu, who’d switched from female lovers to him, had vanished. “She...found a prettier girl,” he mumbled.

The room erupted in laughter. “You turned her gay again?” Guanyu choked through giggles.

“Maybe she left because I’m broke!” Jia Bo lamented. “No money, no women!”

After settling the commotion, Guanyu prepared to leave but was stopped by Jia Bo’s anxious query: “My salary, Boss?”

“As a hallmaster, you deserve decent pay—7,000 monthly. Perform well, and it increases.”

Jia Bo leaped joyfully. “Seven thousand! More than enough!”

Wang Hu earned barely over 10,000 managing the factory. For a sinecure position, 7,000 was astronomical—far beyond Jia Bo’s wildest dreams. Elated, he nudged Wei: “Celebrate with a feast! Your treat!”

Wei feigned annoyance. “Your promotion, your bill!”

“My win is yours!” Jia Bo insisted. “Treat me!”

Jia Bo’s financial woes contrasted sharply with Wei’s privilege. Though Guanyu provided an Audi and bonuses, Jia’s spending on hotel rooms, dinners, and designer clothes for dates drained his funds. Recently grounded by empty pockets, he’d nearly drained his gas money. The manager role meant salvation.
