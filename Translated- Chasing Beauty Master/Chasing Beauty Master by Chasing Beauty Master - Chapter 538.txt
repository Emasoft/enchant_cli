Guan Yu glared at the man before him, his fists itching to pummel him senseless. Yet the memory of his crushing defeat at this man's hands forced him to restrain himself. In truth, what gave Guan Yu the greatest pause was Murong Yu's younger sister, Murong Li. During his last reconnaissance mission to the Murong Estate, he had encountered that delicate young woman – a being of entirely different substance from her brother.

As Guan Yu pondered, the man spoke again: “Last time you found Ghostly Veil Grass. What treasure have you dug up this time? Hand it over quietly, or I won’t mind teaching you another lesson.”

“That’s right! Surrender your finds or suffer!” shouted Murong Yu’s lackey.

“I’ve got nothing!” Guan Yu clenched his teeth, knowing he stood no chance against Murong Yu – let alone the old man lurking behind him. Best avoid trouble now. But I’ll make you spit teeth when I’m stronger, he vowed silently.

“Still lying?” Murong Yu sneered. “If you’re empty-handed, why’s your chest bulging? Since you won’t cooperate...” His eyes glinted dangerously.

Guan Yu glanced down in alarm. The massive Body-Reforming Serpentflower pressed against his tunic. “Damned misfortune,” he muttered. “This oversized herb’s become a liability. Can’t surrender it without a fight – even if I’m outmatched.”

His whisper still hung in the air when Murong Yu blurred into motion, crossing the distance between them in three heartbeats. “You brought this upon yourself, brat!” The noble’s fist descended like a warhammer.

Guan Yu’s Body Refinement cultivation surged – Fifth Layer energy hardening his skin to slate-gray stone. But Murong Yu merely laughed. “Still Fifth Layer? You never learn!” His shout shook the clearing: “BARBARIC CHARGE!”

The attacker’s flesh transformed – skin darkening to gunmetal black veined with quicksilver. This argent mist marked Seventh Layer Body Essence, proof of superior refinement. Most cultivators at this stage bore only obsidian hues; Murong Yu’s metallic sheen betrayed exceptional talent.

Impact came like a siege ram. Guan Yu flew backward, gray armor cracking like eggshell. Blood sprayed from his lips as he skidded across dirt. In Body Refinement duels, victory went to the harder flesh. Only upon reaching Qi Refinement could one employ martial techniques – a realm where Murong Yu already dwelled, yet chose to humble Guan Yu through brute dominance.

Guan Yu retched crimson, organs screaming. “Pathetic,” Murong Yu loomed above him. “Surrender what you guard, or my next strike leaves you begging for death.”

Coughing blood, Guan Yu clutched his tunic. This treasure’s lost... but before he could act, a new voice cut through: “Brother Murong, must you torment this poor soul? He’s hardly worth your time.”

Murong Yu’s sneer softened. “Ah, Wang Qi. Since you intercede...” He shot Guan Yu a final glare. “Next time, no one saves you.” The entourage departed like storm clouds retreating.

Wang Qi watched them leave before turning. “You’d best steer clear of that hothead.” His aristocratic features held practiced concern.

“...Thanks.” Guan Yu’s gratitude sounded frostier than intended.

“Insolent wretch!” A Wang clansman barked. “Apologize for your tone!”

“For what?” Guan Yu staggered upright. “Your master already declared me castoff. We’re done here.” He limped away without backward glance.

Wang Qi silenced his fuming retainers with raised hand. Guan Yu felt the noble’s gaze boring into his back – calm as deep lakes, far more unsettling than Murong Yu’s bluster. This Wang Qi moved with polished grace, his cultivation aura eclipsing the Murong heir’s. Yet Guan Yu cared not for noble intrigues. Survival demanded focus.

“Apologies, Brother Wang. Matters press me.” He vanished into the woods without ceremony.

Hours later, Guan Yu stumbled into Elfwood’s outskirts, every step jolting his battered frame. “Damn you, Murong Yu! I’ll carve repayment in your flesh!” He eyed the familiar treeline. “Must sneak past Elder Allen... If he learns I left against orders, Rosy’s expedition rights hang in balance.”

The homestead’s walls loomed taller than memory. Guan Yu scaled them with practiced stealth, only to freeze in his chamber doorway. On his desk sat a telltale powder – Soul-Dissipating Agent! “Allen’s found out...” Panic spiked as his swollen hand purpled. The toxin, brewed from Spectral Beast cores and Sky Spirit Herbs, ravaged cultivators’ meridians. With his qi sealed, Guan Yu could only endure the necrosis.

Footsteps echoed. Before he could hide the evidence, Elder Allen materialized in the doorway. “Explain your hand.”

“I... tripped?” Even Guan Yu winced at the feeble lie.

The elf elder’s smile held winter. “Cease fabrication. I tracked you to Darkmoon Forest.” His gaze softened at Guan Yu’s shock. “The powder’s diluted. Suffer a day – it’ll pass.”

Relief warred with guilt. “And... Aimi?”

Allen’s face clouded. “Still comatose. This tragedy...”

“Blame Locke, not yourself! That traitorous–”

“Enough.” Allen raised a forest-veined hand. “I spared Locke for reasons beyond your ken. Should he return...” Moonlight glinted on the elder’s dagger. “Justice awaits.”

Their debate halted as a breathless guard burst in. “Elder! Lady Aimi awakens!”

In the great banyan’s heart-chamber, the revived elf maiden blinked up at them. “Father... Dragonkin Brother... Did you catch the bad man?”

Allen clasped her frail hand. “Rest now, little sapling. Vengeance can wait.”

But Guan Yu’s thoughts raced elsewhere – to Wang Qi’s unfathomable power, and the coming storm no elf magic could weather.
