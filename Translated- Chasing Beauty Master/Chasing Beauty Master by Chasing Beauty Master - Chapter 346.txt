“Kid, your Grandpa Monkey will show you what’s what today!” The yellow-haired monkey narrowed his eyes and threw a punch at Qin Tian’s face without hesitation—a blatant sneak attack.

Of course, fueled by alcohol, his ambush was far from successful.

Qin Tian grabbed the yellow-haired monkey’s wrist, bent his knees, and executed a flawless shoulder throw, slamming him to the ground with a heavy thud. The monkey writhed in pain, gritting his teeth.

“With skills like yours, you dare harass women and threaten to keep me from leaving this bar? I suggest you stop overworking your right hand and focus on getting healthier first,” Qin Tian sneered, his tone laced with disdain.

The crowd burst into laughter at his witty jab, their mockery echoing through the room.

“Look at this scrawny stick! He thinks he can take advantage of women? He doesn’t even know how to spell ‘death’!”

“Haha, go home and keep your right hand busy. Women aren’t for you!”

“How could a right hand understand his loneliness? Haha…”

…

The yellow-haired monkey scrambled to his feet, his face flushing crimson under the crowd’s jeers. He pointed at Qin Tian and screeched, “Y-you… just wait! I’ll get people to kill you!”

His threats only amplified the laughter, driving him to flee the scene in humiliation.

Qin Tian shrugged, unbothered. To him, the monkey’s bluster was just a pathetic attempt to save face.

“Wenwen, are you okay?” Qin Tian turned to Wen Ya, his voice gentle.

She shook her head. “Thank you for earlier.”

“You’re my friend. How could I stand by and watch?” He smiled.

Wen Ya nodded, and silence fell between them.

“Weren’t you heading to the restroom? I’ll walk with you—let me play protector for once,” Qin Tian offered, breaking the tension.

“Thank you,” she said softly.

As they walked away, the scene shifted to Guan Yu’s table on the second floor, where the group had witnessed everything. Guan Yu’s expression remained neutral, but Niu Le fumed.

“So she’s swooning over that guy just because he played hero? After all you did for her, Guan Yu? Ungrateful wench!” Niu Le spat.

Wen Qing shot him a warning look, silencing him. “This isn’t over,” she muttered cryptically.

Guan Yu chuckled. “What does it matter to me?”

Mo Ling patted his back teasingly. “Don’t cry, little brother. I’ll buy you candy later!”

He rolled his eyes, but her antics lightened the mood. “With your charm, why fret over one girl? The world’s full of possibilities!” she quipped.

Meanwhile, Xu Yuan sauntered over to Jiang Ziqi’s table, a sly grin on his face. “Guess who’s here? Your old rival, Guan Yu—with Mo Ling clinging to him, no less.”

Jiang Ziqi’s calm façade cracked momentarily. “Where is he?”

“Downstairs, celebrating a birthday. Let’s crash the party,” Xu Yuan suggested.

Jiang Ziqi smirked. “Smash the cake. Make it messy.”

Zhao Qianxiong, eager to impress, volunteered. “Leave it to me!”

Soon, Huang Mao Hou returned with a gang, emboldened by Zhao’s backing. He kicked over a table, sending bottles shattering across the floor. “You think you can cross me? Today, you’ll pay!”

Chaos erupted as the thugs descended. Qin Tian fought valiantly but was overwhelmed, blood streaming from his head. Chen Si screamed, paralyzed by fear.

Wen Ya stepped forward. “Stop this! If it’s an apology you want, I’ll give it!”

Huang Mao Hou leered. “Apologize? Only if you and your friends spend the night with me!”

“Never!” Wen Ya slapped him.

Enraged, he struck back, sending her sprawling. Chen Si wept helplessly as the violence escalated.

In the end, brutality reigned. The once-celebratory night dissolved into a nightmare of fists and broken glass.
