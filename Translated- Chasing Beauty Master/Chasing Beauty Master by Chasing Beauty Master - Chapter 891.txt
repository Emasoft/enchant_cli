Guan Yu shook his head helplessly. There was no helping it—Jin Hua simply loved to play around, a trait she shared with Zhang Han, and once she started, she’d never stop. Guan Yu asked softly, “Ah Cai, it’s best you don’t move right now. Wait until the medicine’s effects wear off a bit more.”

Ah Cai couldn’t even speak without discomfort, so he remained silent. Nodding was too strenuous, leaving him no choice but to blink twice at Guan Yu to signal his understanding.

Jin Hua chuckled. “Hmph! Serves you right for laughing at me. Next time, you won’t be so lucky.” Ah Cai thought bitterly to himself, *There won’t* need *to be a next time. This single incident is enough to haunt me for life.*

“Come now, Jin Hua,” Guan Yu said with a sigh. “Ah Cai is one of us. Don’t you think you went too far? If I hadn’t stopped you, he might’ve been done for.” This time, Jin Hua’s antics had indeed crossed a line.

Jin Hua retorted indignantly, “He’s the one who mocked me—and so gleefully too! This young lady doesn’t take kindly to that. He looks worse than he is. At most, he’d end up permanently disabled. If there’s a next time, that’s exactly what’ll happen!”

Guan Yu could only sigh. Truthfully, his heart leaned toward Jin Hua. No matter how wildly she played, he’d never get angry. But if anyone dared mistreat her? That was another matter entirely.

“That won’t do,” Guan Yu protested. “Ah Cai’s a brother I just took in today. Do you expect me to care for a cripple? That’d be inviting trouble!” He felt obliged to defend Ah Cai, at least verbally.

After all, Ah Cai had only just allied himself with Guan Yu, who’d vowed to treat him as a sworn brother. For Jin Hua to reduce him to this state within a day—though Guan Yu didn’t truly mind—he had to maintain appearances.

Failing to stand up for Ah Cai might breed resentment, and Guan Yu demanded absolute loyalty. Even a sliver of doubt could jeopardize their future.

“Hmph! He’s fine this time. Just let him be more careful next time,” Jin Hua said airily. Noticing Lai Li had fully recovered, she sauntered over. “There, there! Ah Cai’s fine. Quit staring. You should wash your face—it’ll help you recover faster.”

Lai Li instinctively shrank back as Jin Hua approached, unnerved by her unpredictable methods. “Relax! I was just teasing Ah Cai,” Jin Hua said, rolling her eyes. “Do I really seem so terrifying?”

Lai Li nodded timidly. “You look sweet, but your methods… Ah Cai’s covered in blood! How is that ‘just teasing’? You can’t play with people’s lives!”

Jin Hua groaned inwardly. *Well, there goes my reputation.* She saw no point in explaining herself. She’d bullied Ah Cai, and that was that.

“Come on, let’s get you cleaned up,” Jin Hua said, helping Lai Li rise. Passing the still-drowsy fake Lai La, she added cheerfully, “Don’t hold this against me, Lai Li. I did save you today, remember?”

“I know,” Lai Li replied politely. “I heard your conversation when I woke up. Thank you.”

Jin Hua gestured to the impostor. “Guan Yu, remove her mask. Let’s see who she really is.” As she spoke, Lai Li staggered, nearly collapsing had Jin Hua not steadied her.

“Sorry,” Lai Li murmured. “My legs suddenly feel weak.”

“Guan Yu!” Jin Hua called. “Carry Lai Li to the bathroom. She can’t walk on her own—the drug’s still strong.” She tried passing Lai Li to him, but Guan Yu remained slumped on the couch, exasperated.

*If Jin Hua hadn’t incapacitated Ah Cai,* he thought bitterly, *he’d handle this.* Now, with Ah Cai immobilized, Guan Yu had to do everything himself.

Resigned, he stood. “Let’s get you to the bathroom. It’ll help dispel the drug faster.” Scooping Lai Li into a princess carry, he ignored her startled gasp. Her face flushed crimson—this was her first time being held by a man.

Lai Li squirmed slightly, overwhelmed by the warmth of his chest and the unfamiliar intimacy. “Stop fidgeting,” Jin Hua teased. “You’ll make him drop you!” She hid a smile, aware of Lai Li’s budding feelings for Guan Yu. *Lucky girl,* she thought.

“How does it feel,” Jin Hua asked Guan Yu slyly, “holding a woman in your arms?”

Guan Yu stiffened, thrown by the question. “Not bad,” he replied, recovering with a grin. “Though the bathroom’s too close. A longer walk might’ve been nicer.”

Lai Li buried her face in his shoulder, mortified. After washing up, she regained clarity while Guan Yu removed the impostor’s mask—a marvel of craftsmanship, complete with a wig. The bound woman glared up at him.

“Using knockout drugs? How despicable!” she spat.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Says the kidnapper. What’s your name?”

“Chen Xiaona,” she grudgingly admitted, parched from the drug’s aftereffects. Guan Yu offered water, exploiting her thirst to pry information about her human-trafficking ring.

“How many are in your organization?” he pressed.

“Two hundred,” she muttered. “I’m mid-ranked.”

Guan Yu feigned interest in joining, dangling freedom in exchange for cooperation. Yet when she demanded her bonds be loosened, he backtracked. “Can’t risk you attacking us.”

“Liar!” she seethed. “You’re as vile as your tricks!”

Unfazed, Guan Yu continued his psychological game, determined to break her loyalty. Meanwhile, Jin Hua observed, amused by his tactics. The standoff stretched on—a battle of wits between captor and captive, each probing for weakness.
