However, after entering this state, the seal seemed to transform from a robust adult to a centenarian overnight. Not only did it appear incapable of resistance, but it also continuously leaked inner energy and fragments of Guanyu's memories. This phenomenon deeply intrigued Guanyu.

Guanyu speculated that if this were truly the case, then by frequently entering such states, he could gradually exhaust the seal. Once it expelled all the inner energy and memories, he might finally find a way to eradicate it completely.

Yet these were mere conjectures. The seal still operated, and Guanyu dared not predict its next moves. Residing within his mind, the seal wasn't something to confront recklessly. Moreover, the vast amounts of inner energy and memories it had absorbed wouldn't be relinquished easily—this would be a protracted process.

In this peculiar state, the seal seemed restrained by some unseen force, unable to resist. The inner energy core within his dantian voraciously absorbed the returning energy like a starving child insatiably devouring sustenance.

Guanyu grew increasingly exhilarated. This time, the seal had released copious amounts of inner energy, causing his energy core to expand by more than a full circle. Such substantial recovery indicated significant restoration of his capabilities. He thrilled at the prospect of complete restoration through continued efforts.

Yet even this progress paled in comparison to his former peak—these recovered energies were but a drop in the ocean of his former might.

Suddenly, Guanyu felt as though his skull had been struck by a massive blow. Dizziness overwhelmed him, his legs buckling beneath him. This development alarmed the artifact spirit. While others entering similar states faced no dangers, Guanyu's sudden collapse defied understanding—had he somehow intoxicated himself?

The crushing pain intensified exponentially. Within moments, Guanyu collapsed completely, consciousness deserting him. Neither he nor the artifact spirit comprehended the cause, but the situation now grew perilous. The artifact spirit realized Guanyu's presence here wasn't mere consciousness—it was his very soul.

A severe injury to his soul here could prove catastrophic. The artifact spirit sensed the seal in Guanyu's mind frenziedly attempting to reclaim the leaked energy. Meanwhile, the physical Guanyu appeared asleep on horseback, embracing Wang Xiaorong.

"Your Highness! We're ambushed ahead!" A messenger's shout roused the slumbering prince. Yu Shu's scout had reported two missing patrols earlier, but only now confirmed the roadblock's severity. The assailants' identities remained unknown—neither imperial guards nor Embroidered Uniform agents, but rather a mix of Jianghu factions and over twenty cultivators.

Within the Imperial Seal's dimension, the artifact spirit desperately sought solutions. Though Guanyu's physical form slept on horseback, a sliver of his awareness registered the external crisis. These interceptors complicated matters immensely—their cultivation prowess posed grave threats.

Yu Shu recognized the Jianghu elements targeting Prince Zou. With imminent attack likely, he urgently sought the prince's instructions. Inside the artifact space, Guanyu stirred despite his昏迷, sensing external dangers through residual consciousness.

"Old Cang! Wake up! Don't scare me! What's wrong?" Wang Xiaorong's panicked cries finally roused him. The group stared anxiously as Guanyu blinked awake on the grass. "Just deep sleep," he reassured, wiping her tears. "Don't fret."

"You terrified us! We couldn't wake you!" Xiaorong choked out relief.

Qiqí reported urgently: "Master Handsome, our path's blocked ahead."

Guanyu rose with their support. "Prepare crossbows. We may need spellcraft." This drew uneasy glances—revealing their cultivation identities now risked ruining their long-maintained disguises.

Red Talisman questioned, "Why so tense before assessing them?"

Guanyu improvised: "Consider our proximity to the capital. Only formidable foes would dare attack royal guards. Prepare for the worst." He organized defenses, assigning positions while keeping Qiqí protected.

Wang Jun proposed relocating the prince from his carriage—a decoy to misdirect attacks. Approved, they swiftly moved Prince Zou to safety behind shield formations.

Approaching the blockade, Guanyu shouted through the tension: "Clever hounds don't block roads! Name your price!"

Mocking laughter answered: "Big words from two cultivators! What can you offer?"

Guanyu gambled: "Wealth? Status? A future beyond servitude!"

"Save your breath," came the retort. "Surrender Prince Zou, or perish."

"Royal guards stand here!" Guanyu countered. "Strike them, and no sanctuary in this realm will shelter you—not even your Second Prince's patronage!"

The attackers stirred uneasily at his veiled threats. Guanyu pressed harder: "Dare you face the Demon Soul Sect's wrath? Your demonic sect's collusion with royalty won't remain hidden!"

Murmurs erupted among the black-clad figures. Their pretense of anonymity crumbled as Guanyu's words struck true—their secret allegiance exposed to the night.
