“Oh? Little sister, this item is extraordinarily valuable. Though I, Guan Yu, am no merchant, such peerless healing elixirs capable of saving a cultivator at the Body Unity stage aren’t things I’d casually sell. However, out of sincerity for our first transaction and a genuine desire for long-term cooperation, I initially intended to proceed. Yet now it seems I was naive. Since none of you approach this with true sincerity, let us conclude this exchange. Should any wish to imitate that fool from earlier, I’ll gladly oblige. What say you?” Guan Yu smiled leisurely, his tone deceptively light, yet the steel beneath his words left all present feeling the potential losses outweighed any gains.

* * *

“Ahem…Brother Guan, why must you…” Yin Qianji attempted mediation, clinging to a sliver of hope.

* * *

**Boom!**

As the group made their final efforts, thunderous impacts suddenly resounded from outside. Guan Yu clicked his tongue in irritation. Was that stubborn fool truly courting death?

“Guan Yu! You wretched bastard! Come out here! I’ve never been slapped in my life, you motherf—urk…!” Li Qinghe’s enraged bellows echoed as he furiously assaulted the protective formation. Golden light erupted with each strike, yet the seemingly fragile barrier held firm, unyielding despite the onslaught.

* * *

In a flicker of movement, Guan Yu materialized before Li Qinghe, his gaze laced with mocking amusement. The demonic sect members followed, Qingtian watching with entertained relish while Yin Qianji’s ashen face betrayed profound regret.

* * *

_Why did I bring this imbecile? This humiliation…Birds of a feather indeed. My reputation is ruined._

* * *

“Whose ‘father’ do you claim to be?” Guan Yu’s voice dropped to an arctic chill. “Dare raise your voice on my territory—do you seek death?” A flash of killing intent pierced the air. Li Qinghe froze under that glacial stare, drenched in cold sweat as primal terror locked his limbs. This man would kill him without hesitation.

* * *

“Brother Guan,” Yin Qianji interjected with a sigh, “Qinghe acted improperly. I beg your leniency. Consider this a personal favor.”

* * *

“And why should Yin Qianji’s favor hold value?” Guan Yu snorted. In a blur of motion, Li Qinghe crumpled like a shrimp, hurtling backward with a cacophony of cracking bones. He landed as a broken doll, breath rasping weakly.

* * *

“I detest vulgar cursing—especially from men. Leave. Now. Before my mood sours.” Guan Yu dusted his hands and turned toward his villa. With a golden flash, the dazed onlookers found themselves teleported fifty meters away.

* * *

Qingtian chuckled, “I warned you—only sincerity works with Guan Yu. Did you think he wouldn’t notice your collusion? That he granted two items was generous. My prize is secured—I take my leave.” The demonic cultivator departed, satisfied with his vial of Demon蛟 blood.

* * *

“Elder Brother Yin!” Duan Jiayao fretted, “Without the Seven Orifices Heart Salvation Pill, Grandmother’s injuries…!” She alone had opposed the bidding scheme. Now disaster struck, leaving her desperate.

* * *

Yu Xuansong, having witnessed Guan Yu’s prowess in ancient ruins—how a Golden Core mid-stage cultivator had withstood a Nascent Soul expert—handed Yin a list. “Brother Yin, perhaps you can still negotiate? These items are useless to him. Our offers…”

* * *

“I’ll try,” Yin accepted the lists grimly. As the scheme’s architect, he never anticipated this outcome.

* * *

Later, Zhao Mu finally voiced his grievance: “Brother Yu, why didn’t you teach that arrogant Guan Yu a lesson? Li Qinghe was one of ours!”

* * *

Yu Xuansong sighed, “Little Mu, our families are close, so hear this truth: Together, we might not defeat him. That ‘arrogant’ man is now invincible in the mortal realm. A Golden Core who duels Nascent Souls? There’s only one such monster.”

* * *

**Chapter 1226: Regret**

“Insufferable! Do they take me for a fool?” Guan Yu stormed into his villa, frustration boiling. Managing cultivator dealings fell to him alone—a role he loathed yet excelled at.

* * *

Li Xi emerged, having refined the Assassin Sect’s mountain estate. “Darling, those ‘discounted’ items? We’ll make them repay tenfold. You were magnificent earlier.”

* * *

Once managing Guan Yu’s mortal enterprises, Li Xi now embraced cultivation. The final estate slot went to loyal subordinate Lin Dong.

* * *

“Merely setting the stage,” Guan Yu grinned. His rare artifacts guaranteed demonic sects’ desperation. Today’s trial proved their value in this resource-starved world.

* * *

Li Xi’s eyes sparkled vulpine. “Extorting them without recourse? Delicious.” Only with Guan Yu did her inner mischief surface.

* * *

Three days later, pressured factions forced the Li Clan to apologize. At Li Xi’s auction, bids skyrocketed. Guan Yu profited immensely—and attracted complications.

* * *

“Guan Yu,” came Zhang Ziran’s warning call, “consorting with demons invites trouble.”

* * *

“Trading relics for resources,” Guan Yu shrugged. “I remain righteous—the Demon Subjugation Sect backs me.”

* * *

Surprise struck when Li Qi and son Li Xuan arrived—former tycoons who’d once scorned him.

* * *

“We don’t serve Lis!” Li Xi glared. Lin Dong frowned—why were they admitted?

* * *

Li Qi smiled unctuously, “All feuds dissolve before profit. We bring…”

* * *

“Gifts?” Guan Yu’s voice sliced through. “You overestimate yourselves. I’d forgotten your existence—why remind me? I’m no gentleman. Begone.”

* * *

Li Xuan erupted, “You fuc—!” An invisible force choked him mid-curse, hoisting him like a goggle-eyed frog.

* * *

“Release him!” Li Qi lunged, immobilized mid-step.

* * *

“Once, I showed restraint. Now?” Guan Yu sneered. “Crush them, Xi’er. Any who aid these fools oppose me.” The Lis vanished, hurled into the dirt outside.

* * *

**Chapter 1227: Secret Realm**

“Wait!” Li Qi desperately shouted. “A secret—our clan’s heritage! We’re descended from Tang royalty!”

* * *

Guan Yu paused. “Speak plainly.”

* * *

“An ancient secret realm map!” Li Qi produced yellowed parchment. Guan Yu’s Golden Core stirred—the map pulsed with pure spiritual energy.

* * *

“Leave.” Snatching the map, Guan Yu vanished.

* * *

Studying the terrain at the Assassin Sect’s ruins, Guan Yu’s eyes widened. “Their true treasure vault!”

* * *

Navigating trapped catacombs, he cursed fiendish mechanisms—particularly the groin-targeting arrow. Deeper within lay an armory steeped in murderous aura.

* * *

A hidden door revealed a hexagonal formation radiating pristine energy. Guan Yu’s Golden Core vibrated eagerly. “A cultivation haven!”

* * *

Channeling the Nine Revolutions Mystic Art’s second layer, he became a vortex, devouring spiritual mist. As energy dwindled, his Golden Core brightened—a Nascent Soul prepared to emerge.
