Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) said, “The creatures of the Demon Realm come in all forms—some formidable, others less so. It defies simple explanation.”

“Does that mean they look like that person over there with an ox’s head?” Qiqi (Precious Jade) pointed at a nearby table.

The group followed her finger with curiosity, only to see four middle-aged men sipping tea. No ox-headed figures were visible.

Guan Yu (Cosmic Space) turned and pressed a hand to Qiqi’s forehead. “Are you unwell, Qiqi? What nonsense are you spouting?”

“I’m perfectly fine!” Qiqi insisted, pointing again. “That man has an ox’s head! It keeps shifting between human and beast forms. Can’t you see it?”

They looked once more, finding nothing unusual. Guan Yu assumed Qiqi was jesting. Those men had been eyeing the Right Envoy since entering—likely the same ones who had tailed her earlier, now pretending to drink tea while stealing glances.

The Right Envoy suddenly slammed the table and seized Qiqi’s wrist, startling both her and Guan Yu. Observing the Right Envoy’s actions, Guan Yu relaxed slightly as she checked Qiqi’s pulse—perhaps suspecting the girl’s vision resulted from illness.

The Right Envoy’s expression shifted dramatically before she exclaimed, “You’re an Innate Spirit Body!” Her stunned tone and widened eyes—a rare display of emotion—left even Wang Xiaorong tense and bewildered.

Qiqi shrank behind Guan Yu, wrenching her wrist free. “What are you doing? I didn’t do anything wrong!” she protested, clutching his arm like a frightened child.

Guan Yu patted her shoulder. “No one will harm you. There’s nothing to fear.”

Turning to the Right Envoy, he asked, “Aunt Right Envoy, what is this ‘Innate Spirit Body’ you mentioned?”

“So you remain unaware,” she replied, regaining her composure. “Sit. I’ll explain.” Though Qiqi refused to leave Guan Yu’s side, he didn’t press her.

“My apologies for startling you,” the Right Envoy said. “I meant no harm—only surprise.”

“Am I truly ill?” Qiqi whispered. “Is this ‘Innate Spirit’ some disease?”

The Right Envoy’s lips twitched with uncharacteristic amusement. “Indeed—a unique ailment. One so rare, millennia may pass without another case.”

Qiqi’s eyes welled up. “A thousand-year illness? Then... there’s no cure?”

“She teases you, Qiqi,” Guan Yu interjected. “You’re perfectly healthy.”

“But she said—”

“It was a jest,” the Right Envoy clarified. “You possess extraordinary gifts, child. As a martial practitioner, surely you’ve sensed your own robust health?”

Qiqi’s worry eased. “I’ve always been strong. Rarely fell sick even as a baby.”

Wang Xiaorong leaned forward. “Enough riddles! What makes this ‘Innate Spirit Body’ special?”

“It lies in her eyes,” the Right Envoy explained. “They pierce through illusions—like the glamour of that ox-headed demon among those men. While we see ordinary humans, Qiqi perceives their true forms.”

Recognition dawned on Wang Xiaorong. “When she called Xiaoqi (Little Seven) a wolf at Demonic Soul Sect—she wasn’t guessing!”

“Precisely. Her pulse confirms it—dual beats unique to Innate Spirits. This child,” the Right Envoy gestured at Qiqi, “is rarer than celestial artifacts.”

Guan Yu smiled. “A treasure indeed.” He recalled their first meeting—a chance encounter that revealed her martial talent, now eclipsed by this revelation.

The Right Envoy grew solemn. “Those trackers included a demon spy. This concerns Demonic Soul Sect deeply—I must inform our master.” She rose abruptly. “We’ll meet again.”

After her departure, Guan Yu visited Jiang Yuankai’s quarters, finding the man attempting energy circulation. “Brother Jiang! Your dantian remains damaged—recklessness could cripple you permanently!”

Jiang Yuankai sighed. “Without internal energy, I can’t even assess my own condition.”

“Allow me.” Guan Yu channeled spiritual force through Jiang’s meridians, cleansing residual lung toxins. The dantian, however, showed no improvement—its fissures beyond natural healing. “Patience,” Guan Yu advised. “Forced recovery will only worsen it.”

As Qiqi’s newfound sight sparked playful investigations from Wang Xiaorong, Guan Yu pondered the road ahead—a world where hidden demons walked among men, visible only through a child’s gifted eyes.
