Wang Xiaorong knew that when she had deliberately allowed herself to be captured by Guan Yu within the enemy camp earlier, the Demon Sovereign must have already learned of this matter.

"Father, that was all part of my strategy to lure the enemy. I intended to infiltrate deep into their ranks and disrupt their formations..."

"Silence!"

Before Wang Xiaorong could finish, the Demon Sovereign harshly cut her off. "Do you have any idea how ruthless Manor Lord Lu has become? With his rising influence these past years, he doesn't even regard me with respect anymore! You marching in there was practically suicide! Consider yourself fortunate to have escaped alive this time. Do you dare repeat such foolishness?"

After being reprimanded, Wang Xiaorong playfully stuck out her tongue and murmured, "Father, I've already admitted my mistake. Besides, I didn't interfere with your grand plans. Why are you so angry?"

"Hmph! I never should have let you go in the first place. And you still have the nerve to come back grinning like an idiot before me."

The Left Envoy quickly interjected, "My Lord, the Young Mistress' contribution was indispensable for our successful capture of Tiger's Maw Manor."

"Oh? You speak in her defense again?" The Demon Sovereign retorted irritably. "She got herself captured and nearly became their bargaining chip against us. What merit does that constitute? She merely caused chaos!"

"My Lord, you only see the surface," the Left Envoy persisted. "Tiger's Maw Manor had prepared thoroughly this time. Despite multiple assassination attempts, they even activated defensive formations that shrouded the entire manor in an impenetrable barrier. External assault would have been futile."

"Moreover, the three Cloud Azure Sect disciples originally assisting Manor Lord Lu began aiding us after the Young Mistress' intervention. Without Guan Yu and his junior brother Xiao Zhi sabotaging from within, breaching that ironclad defense would have been impossible."

"Finally, after failing to rescue the Young Mistress initially, Guan Yu risked his life repeatedly until he personally slew Manor Lord Lu and saved her. Without Guan Yu eliminating their leader, countless more of our brethren would have perished capturing that fortress."

Hearing this account, the Demon Sovereign's anger gradually subsided. Wang Xiaorong secretly winked at the Left Envoy in gratitude for his favorable portrayal of Guan Yu.

The Demon Sovereign refrained from praising his daughter, knowing compliments would inflate her recklessness. Maintaining strictness remained wiser. "This is precisely why you should heed my instructions to cultivate properly! Had your cultivation been higher, you wouldn't have been captured so easily."

"Oh, Young Mistress," the Left Envoy deliberately added, "Guan Yu sends word he'll arrive at our Demonic Soul Sect in two days."

"I already knew!" Wang Xiaorong laughed. "Father, haven't you always wanted Guan Yu to join us? He's finally agreed to come. But you mustn't bully him when he arrives!"

"We'll see about that," the Demon Sovereign coldly snorted. "I'll gauge whether that boy truly possesses the courage to enter our domain."

At this moment, the Right Envoy approached. "Though Guan Yu initially disrupted our formations, his slaying of Manor Lord Lu and rescue of the Young Mistress merits recognition. My Lord, as one who rewards justly, you must acknowledge his great service to our sect."

"How amusing," the Demon Sovereign chuckled darkly. "A Cloud Azure disciple contributing to our Demonic Soul Sect. I wonder what expression Patriarch Xuanming would make hearing this news."

"Father! If you mistreat Guan Yu, I'll warn him not to come!" Wang Xiaorong threatened.

The Demon Sovereign saw through her bluff. "Excellent! Inform him to stay away then. Spare me the irritation. You're the one pining for him, foolish girl!"

"You're being mean again! I won't speak to you!" Wang Xiaorong turned away in a huff.

Internally pleased with their successful retrieval of the Profound Fire Stone and capture of Tiger's Maw Manor—a major victory for the sect—the Demon Sovereign concealed his satisfaction. Examining the glowing stone in his palm, he declared, "All shall be rewarded for their service. Summon Three-Heads immediately."

"But Father, weren't you going to punish them?" Wang Xiaorong asked, realizing she'd been deceived.

"Why would I punish my trusted Left and Right Envoys for flawless execution?" the Demon Sovereign retorted, bewildered.

Wang Xiaorong finally understood—the Twin Envoys stood second only to the Demon Sovereign himself, as indispensable as his own limbs. Minor failures might warrant reprimands, but never true punishment given their vital roles.

Pointing accusingly at the Right Envoy, Wang Xiaorong cried, "Sister Right Envoy! You tricked me into returning! You knew Father wouldn't punish you!"

Chapter 3781: A Troubled Conscience

"You desire the Myriad Forms Plate?" Three-Heads stared in surprise. Though expecting the Demon Sovereign's request, he hadn't anticipated this particular artifact.

The Crimson Lotus Sect used this relic to suppress the Six-Headed Wolf King beneath the Eternal Ice Lotus. Retrieving it while rescuing his mother seemed feasible enough. Though less potent than the Jade Bagua—a supreme treasure storing spiritual energy and spells—the Myriad Forms Plate served as powerful demon-revealing mirror containing formidable suppression arrays.

"Why would you need it when the Right Envoy already masters array formations?" Three-Heads inquired.

"That's not your concern," the Demon Sovereign deflected. "During your rescue, simply retrieve it while destroying their formations. I'll arrange perimeter support if you escape within one incense time. Delay longer, and you'll face Crimson Lotus's full wrath alone."

Elsewhere, Yan Zhao confronted Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi. "Explain yourselves! Why kill Manor Lord Lu?"

Xiao Zhi, though formerly respecting their senior brother, found Yan Zhao's recent actions unconscionable. "Senior Brother, why did you knock Wang Xiaorong unconscious and deliver her to the enemy?"

Yan Zhao stiffened, unprepared for their discovery. "How dare you question me? As Cloud Azure disciples, consorting with demonic women violates our principles! Were the sect to learn of this..."

"Wang Xiaorong has aided us repeatedly through mutual benefit," Guan Yu countered. "But your underhanded methods resemble the very demons you condemn."

"I acted for the greater good!" Yan Zhao roared. "By instigating conflict between our enemies, we gain advantage! Yet you two ruined everything by saving that witch, directly aiding the Demonic Soul Sect's victory! Have you forgotten your allegiance? Should the sect learn of your collusion..."

Yan Zhao's bluster masked inner guilt. Knowing Guan Yu's secret—the hidden Eight-Sided Drum demonic technique—he shifted tactics. "I've long known your secrets, Guan Yu. That 'Meimei' you associate with? Clearly another demonic seductress. Continue this path, and you'll face utter ruin."

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. "I'll handle my affairs. But Senior Brother—how long have you known about the Eight-Sided Drum? Since the Black-Furred Demon captured me at the old farmer's house?"

Yan Zhao paled, realizing his own secret—the blood poison curse forcing him to become that very monster monthly—might be exposed. "Enough! I'll keep your secrets if you keep mine. But cross me again, and neither of us survives this game."

As tensions escalated, Guan Yu suddenly suggested, "Xiao Zhi, fetch us dinner. I'd prefer eating here."

Once alone, Guan Yu confronted Yan Zhao. "No more pretense. I know about your blood poison curse and dealings with the Left Envoy. Should the Demon Sovereign learn you betrayed Wang Xiaorong..."

Yan Zhao's composure shattered. "You dare threaten me?!" He lunged violently, but Guan Yu parried with swift blade work. Their clash continued until Xiao Zhi's return forced Yan Zhao to flee through a window.

"Senior Brother is... the Black-Furred Demon?!" Xiao Zhi gasped as Guan Yu explained Yan Zhao's dual identity and cursed condition. "But he's our role model! How could he be...?"

"The truth often hides in shadow," Guan Yu said grimly. "His monthly transformations under the blood curse explain the killings. The Left Envoy provides his antidote—leverage ensuring his cooperation."

Chapter 3782: Exposed Identity

With Yan Zhao's secrets laid bare, Guan Yu realized the precariousness of their situation. "If the sect learns of my Eight-Sided Drum technique and Yan Zhao's curse, we're all doomed. We must act before he betrays us."

As moonlight filtered through the window, both understood their fragile truce with Yan Zhao could shatter at any moment—a deadly game where exposure meant death, and trust had become the rarest commodity of all.
