Li Hong sobbed. In truth, when she came to kill Granny Wang, she had been utterly terrified – having never done such a thing before. Upon first arriving, she had even exchanged a few words with the old woman, finding herself unable to strike.

Later, realizing time was running short and that the entire plan would fail without immediate action, she steeled her heart and strangled Granny Wang with a rope. Even now, Li Hong’s mind remained turbulent. To kill someone yet maintain composure required immense mental fortitude.

Kneeling on the ground in anguish, Li Hong found some relief after confessing these words.

Lin Zhonggeng stepped forward. “Li Hong, you’re lying. My subordinate clearly saw you leave home with Town Chief Wang – him heading east while you went north. The Town Chief went to gather men, claiming a murder occurred in the north. During that time, you should still have been en route to Granny Wang’s house!”

“How could this be?” The elder physician exclaimed, turning to Town Chief Wang. “Explain this!”

Town Chief Wang’s heart sank. Their hastily devised plan contained too many flaws. Denial remained his only option – without concrete evidence, they couldn’t pin anything on him. “Elder Physician, I never left with Li Hong! This morning I was still asleep when she rushed in saying Granny Wang had died. I threw on clothes without washing up and immediately went to wake my men. By the time we arrived, she’d already passed.”

Guan Yu and Lin Zhonggeng both recognized the lie, but without proof beyond a subordinate’s testimony, they could do little. Guan Yu waited for Second Only to Wolf’s return – the Town Chief’s fatal mistake lay in his rushed timeline, leaving inevitable gaps.

Lin Zhonggeng whispered to Guan Yu, “What now? He’ll keep denying everything.”

“Buy time. Evidence is coming,” Guan Yu assured.

The elder physician shook his head wearily, eyeing Town Chief Wang with newfound suspicion. For a mere woman like Li Hong to commit murder unaided seemed improbable.

Chapter 3062: Avenging Granny Wang

Clearly, Town Chief Wang must have masterminded this. Yet Li Hong shouldered all blame while he remained unscathed, denying any involvement. With no way to implicate him directly, the crowd’s murmurs swelled.

The elder physician raised his hand for silence. “Neighbors, this grave matter concerns us all. How should we deal with Li Hong?”

“Burn her! Such evil doesn’t deserve life!”

“Aye! Burn her to avenge Granny Wang!”

The crowd’s furious roars echoed their grief. Facing such injustice, mercy held no place.

Turning to Town Chief Wang, the elder physician declared, “As her husband, you cannot wash your hands of this! A town chief’s wife committing atrocity implicates your leadership.”

“Y-you’re right,” Town Chief Wang groveled. “I bear responsibility. Let the people punish me.”

The elder physician sighed. As the town’s moral compass, he’d hoped for remorse. Yet the chief showed no contrition – not even pleading for his wife. This callous indifference cemented the elder’s disappointment.

A commotion arose as Second Only to Wolf pushed through the crowd with a trembling middle-aged woman. Recognizing the coffin, she gasped, “Granny Wang’s dead?” Spotting the weeping Li Hong, confusion etched her face.

Town Chief Wang paled – this witness spelled trouble.

Second Only to Wolf reported to Guan Yu: “She confirms the Town Chief visited her home before 5 AM.”

Approaching the woman, Guan Yu spoke gently: “We’ve brought you here to answer questions truthfully. No harm will come to you.” After she nodded, he pointed at a man beside Town Chief Wang. “Know him?”

“My husband,” she whispered.

“This morning, Town Chief Wang came urgently for him. What time?”

“Before dawn. I checked after using the chamber pot – not yet five o’clock.”

Grinning, Guan Yu turned to the elder physician. “Doesn’t this prove their collusion?”

The elder stroked his beard. “Indeed! Li Hong claims she arrived at Granny Wang’s around five, while the Town Chief simultaneously roused men in the east claiming a northern murder. The timing contradicts – Granny couldn’t have been dead yet when he gave the alarm!”

Guan Yu added, “They left home together – Li Hong to kill, the Chief to create an alibi. This coordination bought time for Li Hong’s later errands.”

“Town Chief Wang,” the elder demanded, “your final words?”

“The woman’s mistaken! Should hearsay condemn an innocent?”

The witness retorted, “I never err on timing! My children leave for school at six – I rise at 5:30 to cook. The Chief came before my alarm! I checked – not yet five!”

“Cease excuses!” Guan Yu snapped. “Confess now before worse evidence emerges!”

Chapter 3063: Entrusted to the Lin Family

Lin Zhonggeng interjected, “Granny Wang’s burial takes precedence. The culprit’s identified – we’ll handle punishments afterward.”

Though lacking concrete proof against the Town Chief, sowing doubt sufficed for now.

The elder physician announced, “As the Chief’s spouse is involved, impartial judgment requires entrusting this matter to the Lin Family.” The crowd approved.

Lin Zhonggeng declared, “We’ll detain Li Hong and her kin until after funeral rites. Justice will be served.”

Three days later, the scandal rocked the town. All knew Li Hong killed Granny Wang, with suspected collusion from her husband. Stripped of authority, the disgraced Chief awaited judgment.

As the Lin Family prepared for the trial, Guan Yu planned his departure post-proceedings – before renewed marriage pressure for him and Lin Qiaoqiao could resume.

At dawn, the elder physician arrived at the Lin estate. “I’ve decided,” he told Lin Zhonggeng. “All male Lis deserve burning. As for Li Hong...”

“Include her,” Lin Zhonggeng urged.

“So be it. At noon today, twelve condemned – including Li Hong and Patriarch Li – shall burn in the square. Though Li Gui remains at large...”

“Likely fled far,” Lin Zhonggeng conceded. “We’ll keep searching.”

By midday, the bound prisoners stood encircled by kindling as crowds gathered. Just as torchbearers prepared to ignite the pyre, a voice shouted:

“Halt!”

Li Gui pushed through the throng. “Burn my family, and my allies will slaughter yours!” He gestured behind him – Lin Family women, including Lin Qiaoqiao’s mother, held at knifepoint by armed men.

Lin Zhonggeng roared, “Release them!”

Li Gui sneered, “Free my family first, or watch yours die!”

Chapter 3064: Negotiations

Having exploited the Lin Family’s emptied guard posts, Li Gui’s ambush left them vulnerable. Guan Yu noted the captors’ trained stances – cultivators all.

The elder physician trembled with rage. “Shameless! To threaten innocents!”

“Spare your lectures!” Li Gui spat. “Release my kin, or we all perish together!”

Lin Zhonggeng’s voice shook. “Harm them, and you’ll die screaming!”

Li Gui laughed coldly. “Your choice, Patriarch. Their blood or mine?”
