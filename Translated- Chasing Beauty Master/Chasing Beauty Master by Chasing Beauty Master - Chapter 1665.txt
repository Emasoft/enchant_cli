“Before reaching the desert, we must ensure everyone conserves their strength and energy. When rest is needed, they should rest thoroughly. Only then can we avoid excessive fatigue after entering the desert.”

Guan Yu knew Ling Su wanted to reach the desert early to continue buzzing around Siqi like a fly. Lin Chen also favored this plan, as traveling nonstop would save considerable silver on lodging and provisions – silver that could line his own pockets.

“I don’t think it’s necessary,” Lin Chen said with a twisted smile. “Every disciple of our Cloud Azure Sect is robust. A few days’ journey won’t break them. Even in the desert’s harsh environment, they should endure without issue.”

“We shouldn’t rely on ‘should,’” Guan Yu countered. “We must ensure everyone’s vigor. If we enter the desert already exhausted, our circumstances will differ drastically. Moreover, locating Miao City within the sands won’t be simple. Even if found, we must wait until the fifteenth of July. By then, I anticipate a large-scale conflict there – we’re not the only ones seeking the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Our companions’ condition should be our primary concern.”

After this reasoning, Lin Chen reluctantly acquiesced. As the group mounted up, Ling Su – unusually subdued – rode at the rear with Lin Chen, their whispered conversation suggesting clandestine plots.

Guan Yu rode at the vanguard flanked by Wang Jun, Aze, and Siqi. The latter now walked openly beside Guan Yu, disregarding sidelong glances. She’d long wished to proclaim their intimacy, but Guan Yu forbade it, citing unresolved complexities within the group’s dynamics. As the focal point of many admirers, Siqi’s apparent availability kept hopes alive. Revealing their bond would make Guan Yu a target of collective envy, jeopardizing their mission.

At the city gates, a young couple waved recognition – the pair Guan Yu had aided the previous night. Breaking from his companion, the youth darted before Guan Yu’s horse, prompting Aze’s rebuke: “Fool! You’d risk death?”

“Noble hero,” the youth clasped fists, “I but wish to express undying gratitude. May I know your honored name?”

“Call me Brother Guan,” came the reply. Though similar in age, the youth insisted: “Your ‘small favor’ secured my lifelong happiness.” His summoned sweetheart added tearful thanks, explaining how Guan Yu’s silver had saved her parents from violent debt collectors.

As the procession departed, Wang Jun teased: “Who knew drunkenness bred virtue?” Guan Yu deflected, noting his companions’ fatigue from scant sleep. The journey proceeded uneventfully, Ling Su maintaining distance from Siqi per Lin Chen’s counsel – though Lin Chen himself now courted her favor with calculated charm.

At Liaozhou City’s outskirts, tensions simmered. Ling Su fumed at Lin Chen’s hypocrisy, while Guan Yu stoked his resentment: “While you restrain yourself, Lin Chen fills the void. Clever tactics.”

“That stunted toad?” Ling Su spat. “We’ll see who prevails.”

As duties divided – Lin Chen seeking lodgings, Guan Yu arranging camel purchases – the stage set for escalating rivalries. In Liaozhou’s bustling streets where camel traders congregated, the Cloud Azure Sect’s internal fractures mirrored the city’s chaotic energy, their desert trial looming like the shifting sands themselves.
