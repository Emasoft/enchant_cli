The cool breeze of the sunset had turned into a sinister wind, howling as it blew, making the tent creak and groan.

Gao Wei sat on the ground hugging her knees, listening to the eerie whistling of the malignant air. One phrase kept repeating in her mind: "Dark night brings ghosts!"

She glanced at Guan Yu sleeping beside her, several times wanting to shake him awake, but her hand froze mid-air each time.

"Hold me while we sleep. Then you won't be afraid." Guan Yu's voice suddenly spoke up, startling Gao Wei who had been struggling internally.

"You... you weren't asleep?" Gao Wei exclaimed in surprise.

"Wanted to see how scared someone would get," Guan Yu smiled. "Advice given - take it or leave it. I'm sleeping now!"

"Hmph! I won't give you, this big pervert, any chance!" Gao Wei wrinkled her nose and snorted.

Guan Yu was clearly doing this intentionally. Before sleeping, he'd mentioned the dark night and ghosts just to scare her into clinging to him while sleeping! What a perverted scheme!

Gao Wei lay down beside Guan Yu in a huff, closing her eyes and tightly gripping the sleeping bag.

The night was too dark, too quiet, with the cold sinister wind blowing again.

Outside the tent, including the limping Zhan Shouwang, seven men lurked silently in the darkness like predators waiting to strike when their prey was most vulnerable.

These were professional killers - cruel and ruthless. Though Zhan Shouwang desperately wanted Guan Yu dead, even he dared not act recklessly, forced to wait patiently until their target slept deeply.

At 2 AM, dark clouds veiled the moon, plunging the earth into utter darkness. Killer leader Bo Hu signaled two snipers who ghosted away to take elevated positions, their rifle muzzles trained on the tent.

As Bo Hu's team advanced with submachine guns, Zhan Shouwang quivered with anticipation - his vengeance was at hand!

Just as the killers closed in, Guan Yu's eyes snapped open inside the tent, sharp glints flashing within them.

He suddenly embraced Gao Wei, covering her mouth as he whispered: "Don't make noise. Armed men outside!"

Gao Wei was startled by the abrupt movement, initially fearing Guan Yu meant to take advantage. But hearing of gunmen outside, panic set in.

"Follow my instructions if you want to live!" Guan Yu released her slightly, his voice low but urgent.

Though terrified and confused why their lives were threatened, survival instinct made Gao Wei nod hurriedly.

"I'll carry you. Wrap your legs around my waist like before - understand?" Without waiting for confirmation, Guan Yu lifted her. As she clung to him, the entire tent began shaking violently.

To the killers outside, the tent's vigorous movements and accompanying feminine gasps suggested passionate activities - the perfect distraction.

Bo Hu sneered coldly. In his eyes, Guan Yu was already dead. He signaled four men to open fire on the tent.

For two minutes, bullets rained until the tent lay in tatters. Watching from nearby, the rescued Gao Wei trembled in horror - had Guan Yu not foreseen this, they'd both be dead!

"Stay hidden. I'll handle this." Guan Yu vanished into darkness, radiating murderous intent.

The enraged hunters became the hunted. Using his探查 system, Guan宇 located two approaching killers. After ensuring no backups lurked nearby, he struck with lethal efficiency, eliminating one before escaping under covering gunfire.

But the remaining killer threw a flashbang. In the blinding glare, hidden snipers struck - bullets tore through Guan Yu's arm and leg.

Bleeding heavily, Guan宇 fled into darkness. Tracking the blood trail, hunters closed in like wolves.

Back at camp, a bloodied figure emerged - Gao Wei had been captured. When told of Guan Yu's supposed death, her face drained of color.

As the killers debated executing her, distant gunfire echoed. Seizing the distraction, a wounded but lethal Guan宇 emerged from shadows - the real hunt had just begun...
