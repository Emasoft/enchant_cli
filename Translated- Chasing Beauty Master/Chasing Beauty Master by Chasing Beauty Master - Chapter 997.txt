Fang Su did not lose his temper, still restraining himself. “Guan Yu, actually my sister was just acting impulsively. Why must you hold a grudge against a woman? Extorting money from a girl—if this gets out, wouldn’t it damage your reputation?”

“Damn it! Since I’ve already done this, why the hell would I care about reputation?” Guan Yu thought. Delaying time like this wasn’t bad either. If they fought now, he might be at a disadvantage.

Guan Yu added, “Fang Ding gave me five million. That shouldn’t concern you, Fang Su, right? Isn’t your Fang family busy cleaning up their messes? So the recordings I have are no longer a threat to your family? Earlier, I wanted to sell them to Fang Ding for ten million, but she refused and even sent over two hundred people to deal with me. It took a Herculean effort to drive them all away. Tell me—is taking five million from her too much?”

Hearing this, Fang Su fell silent. However, the mention of Guan Yu’s recordings reignited his resolve: today, he absolutely could not let Guan Yu walk away. Those recordings posed too great a threat to the Fang family.

Moreover, even if the Fang family tried to cover things up, secrets couldn’t stay hidden forever. If the recordings were made public, the Fang family would suffer. On second thought, spending ten million to buy all the recordings from Guan Yu might not be a loss.

At least, the Fang family had already spent over five million to settle key figures. Yet Fang Su didn’t trust Guan Yu’s integrity. With a petty mind judging a nobleman’s heart, he believed even if they paid ten million, Guan Yu would keep backups.

Once the recordings were bought, Guan Yu could still threaten the Fang family endlessly with copies. It seemed there was no peaceful resolution today.

**Chapter 2549: Free of Charge**

Fang Su surveyed the scene. The opposing side had just over thirty people, including a few construction workers—fewer than forty in total.

He had brought over fifty men today, all cultivators. If a fight broke out, Fang Su was confident of total victory. But Fang Ding had warned him about the extraordinary girl by Guan Yu’s side.

Earlier, Fang Ding described Jones and Xue Jing’s prowess—how one kick had sent Senior Brother Chen flying. What did that mean? Fang Su felt a chill crawl up his spine.

He knew Senior Brother Chen well. Fang Su clearly remembered him as a Second-Class Revered Realm expert, yet a girl beside Guan Yu had kicked him away effortlessly. It was unimaginable.

Thus, Fang Su didn’t rush to order an attack. Instead, he kept scrutinizing the masked girl next to Guan Yu—likely the one Fang Ding mentioned. She stuck to Guan Yu like a shadow, his personal bodyguard.

“Guan Yu, aren’t you ashamed as a man hiding behind a woman all day? You disgrace our gender!” Fang Su attempted provocation. If he could enrage Guan Yu into abandoning his protector and fighting alone, that would be ideal.

He assumed Guan Yu, being prideful, would step forward to defend his honor. A laughably naive plan.

“Whether I disgrace men or not isn’t your concern. If you’re capable, find your own protector! Mine comes free—unlike your expensive hired thugs. Can they guard you 24/7? My free protector outshines yours, protecting me day and night, even during baths and sleep.”

Guan Yu pulled Xue Jing close, planting a light kiss on her cheek. “What? Jealous? Go find your own beautiful expert to accompany you. That’d prove your worth.”

Having known Guan Yu this long, Xue Jing had never been kissed publicly—rarely even holding hands. Now, before so many outsiders, her face flushed crimson beneath the mask, neck burning with a mix of happiness and shyness.

The Yu Gang members were awed by their boss’s boldness, erupting into cheers: “Another kiss! Another kiss!”

Fang Su hadn’t expected such shamelessness. He thought himself unscrupulous, but Guan Yu redefined the term.

“Guan Yu, what’s there to boast about a woman? I have at least two women serving me nightly without bragging. You’re satisfied with just one? A country bumpkin, indeed. Let me show you what multiple women look like someday.”

To someone like Fang Su, having women was trivial. Wealthy young masters considered playing with women their birthright—common among affluent families. Richer ones chased minor celebrities or went abroad for exotic flings.

Fang Su wasn’t lying—he’d never lacked money or women. What he envied was Guan Yu’s superhuman female guardian.

Beautiful women were plentiful, but finding a young, stunning, and supremely skilled one was near impossible. Most female experts were either unattractive or elderly.

Assuming Guan Yu’s companion hid ugliness or age behind the mask, Fang Su mocked, “So proud of a woman you have to mask her? Must be a monster terrifying to behold! Hah!”

“My woman’s appearance is my business,” Guan Yu retorted calmly.

Xue Jing seethed at being called a monster. If permitted, she’d kick Fang Su’s teeth out for insulting her.

“Ugly is ugly,” Fang Su sneered. “And old too, I bet.” His taunts pushed Xue Jing’s explosive temper to its limit.

“Guan Yu, stop parading this stinking hag. People will think you’re sick, liking old ugly—”

Before he finished, Guan Yu removed Xue Jing’s mask. The sudden reveal left her glaring lethally at Fang Su, her breathtaking beauty stunning the crowd.

Even Fang Su gaped, jaw slack.

**Chapter 2550: Jealousy**

His men mirrored his shock—awestruck yet envious.

Guan Yu smirked. “The women by my side are always the fairest. The mask spares you vulgar eyes. But tell me, Fang Su—have any of your conquests rivaled her?”

Fang Su remained dumbstruck, devouring Xue Jing with his gaze. Disgusted yet smug, she endured.

“Put it back. Their stares make me feel robbed,” Guan Yu said, returning her mask.

Recovering, Fang Su burned with jealousy. *If she were mine, I’d trade years of life! That bastard Guan Yu doesn’t deserve her!*

Jia Bo swaggered forward. “This is just one of Boss’s women! You gape like hicks? He’s got a houseful of beauties—far beyond your peasant comprehension!”

Xue Jing shot him a glare. “Jia Bo, silence serves you better.” Her mood, lifted by Guan Yu’s kiss and the crowd’s reaction, soured at his boast.

Fang Su, perplexed, wondered how Guan Yu managed multiple women without constant infighting.

“Enough,” Fang Su snapped. “I’m here to reclaim my sister’s five million. We’ll discuss buying the recordings afterward.”

The Fang family’s finances were strained. Retrieving the money could alleviate their crisis. With the patriarch bedridden from stress, Fang Su’s incompetence accelerated their decline. Hiring fifty cultivators had already cost two million—reclaiming five would barely break even.

Guan Yu coldly stated, “Ten million for the recordings. Not a cent less.”

For the Fangs, money solved problems—but distrust lingered. Even with payment, they feared backups. Yet without buying them, dismantling their schemes demanded time, effort, and favors.

“Compromise,” Fang Su urged. “Keep the five million, take another five, and give us the recordings.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “The five million was Fang Ding’s apology. Ten million buys the recordings—no backups. Take it or leave it.”

“You lack sincerity!” Fang Su spat. Negotiations were futile.

**Chapter 2551: No Surprise**

Talks stalled. Fang Su feared Guan Yu’s retaliation if provoked—leaving the Fangs vulnerable if recordings leaked.

Yet without trust, no deal could stick. The Fangs needed days to gather ten million anyway.

Guan Yu cared little. The Yu Gang’s funds sufficed for now. Prolonging this charade bought time.

“Seems we’re at an impasse,” Fang Su glowered. Violence loomed—his cultivators against Guan Yu’s thirty-odd.

But Xue Jing’s presence gave pause. One kick had felled a Revered Realm expert. Fang Su’s men wavered.

Guan Yu leaned back, sipping tea. “Still confident, Young Master Fang?”

Roaring, Fang Su ordered the attack. Cultivators surged forward—only for Xue Jing to blur into motion.

*Crack!*

The first assailant flew meters back, ribs shattered. Chaos erupted as she weaved through them, precise strikes dropping bodies.

Fang Su paled. *This… this is impossible!*

In minutes, his forces lay moaning. Xue Jing stood unscathed, mask perfectly in place.

“Your move,” Guan Yu said mildly.

Defeated, Fang Su fled, humiliation burning. The Yu Gang’s laughter chased him out.

Xue Jing reattached her mask, cheeks still pink. Guan Yu grinned. “Let’s go home.”

The Fangs’ decline was sealed—their heir outmatched, their secrets dangling by a thread. And Guan Yu? He had a universe to conquer, one arrogant young master at a time.
