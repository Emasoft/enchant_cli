“Hmph? A minor scuffle? A scuffle that leaves someone in that state? A scuffle that shattered my younger brother’s nose? For no reason at all? How could I possibly believe that? If there’s truly no reason, it’d be like you—walking down the street for no reason—suddenly bedding a man you meet? Letting some random man have his way with you?” Jin Xing sneered in retort.

Chapter 250: The Life-Threatening Strike

Jin Xing’s crude, deliberately provocative remarks toward Liu Shilei instantly ignited a murderous glint in Guan Yu’s eyes, his teeth grinding silently. 11.!

Indeed… Guan Yu had appeared here precisely because of the insults Jin Xing’s underlings had hurled at Liu Shilei. Now, what drove Guan Yu to strike was Jin Xing’s own contemptuous insults toward her.

Without warning, Guan Yu swiftly sidestepped Liu Shilei and lunged forward, seizing Jin Xing’s collar before violently yanking him sideways. Caught completely off guard, Jin Xing had no time to react—Guan Yu moved like lightning. A dark shadow flashed before his eyes, and suddenly his entire body was flung off-balance, sent careening through the air.

As effortlessly as one might toss a toddler, Guan Yu sent Jin Xing staggering. But as Jin Xing stumbled past, Guan Yu pivoted and delivered a thunderous kick to his ribs—the impact echoing like a drumbeat. Jin Xing’s body crashed into a wall before crumpling to the floor.

The entire sequence unfolded in the blink of an eye. By the time the onlookers registered what had happened, the burly, bald Jin Xing lay sprawled on his back, clutching his side in agony.

“Fuck! You dare attack us?!” roared one of Jin Xing’s men, brandishing a weapon as he charged forward.

But they were too slow. Niu Le, standing behind Guan Yu, reacted far quicker. Before the assailants could close in, Niu Le gripped his blade, sidestepped, and leaped high—plunging the knife downward toward Jin Xing’s skull.

Jin Xing, still curled on the floor, opened his eyes to see the descending blade and nearly soiled himself. He jerked his head aside just as the blade struck the marble floor with a metallic clang, sparks flying.

Silence gripped the room.

Jin Xing scrambled to his feet, ignoring the pain in his ribs, and scuttled back to his men like a terrified insect. He stared wide-eyed at the hulking, dark-skinned figure before him.

Holy hell… What kind of lunatic was this? That strike—without the slightest hesitation—had been aimed to kill! This wasn’t a brawl; this was attempted murder!

Jin Xing’s men gaped at Niu Le in disbelief. Who was this kid? How could someone so young be so vicious? Even seasoned gangsters among them had never seen such ruthless intent—attacking to kill from the first move. What kind of grudge demanded taking a life?

At that moment, the terrified Jin Xing finally understood why his younger brother had been so thoroughly beaten by these four. Why Jin Cheng, who’d never known defeat despite his gang of followers, had fallen to them.

These two in particular fought without rules or restraint. Against their numbers, most would hesitate to retaliate—let alone strike first. But that blade-wielding maniac had nearly ended him. One slip, and the knife would have pierced his skull. He’d brushed shoulders with death itself.

Drained of strength, Jin Xing paled as he stared blankly at Guan Yu’s group, any threats dying on his lips. His bravado evaporated. To fight or flee—neither choice appealed.

If he retreated now, what face would he have left after marching in with such bluster, only to flee after being kicked and nearly stabbed? But to fight… These madmen would turn this into a blood feud. Either path spelled disaster.

While Jin Xing hesitated, Guan Yu pointed disdainfully at him. “Come at me if you’ve got a grievance. Leave the woman out of it. Weren’t you here to avenge your brother? Well? We’re all here. How do you want to play this? All at once?”

The arrogance in his tone dismissed the gang of thugs entirely. Guan Yu radiated confidence. With his full strength unleashed—gravity manipulation and bone-shattering strikes—he could drop these fools one by one. Let them hack at him; he’d crush them before they could bring him down.

Footsteps pounded up the stairs. A bespectacled faculty dean arrived with several PE teachers. “What’s happening here? This is a school!”

The dean’s bluster faltered upon seeing the gang’s imposing figures. “Ah… Jin Cheng’s brother? We’re already handling his case. Let’s resolve this calmly, yes?” His tone turned obsequious as he recognized Jin Xing.

Damn it… Even Jin Cheng had been untouchable at this school. His brother’s crew, armed and glaring, made the dean’s knees weak. His PE teachers stood no chance against these brutes.

Chapter 251: Fight to the Death? Let’s Go!

The dean’s groveling gave Jin Xing an exit. “This isn’t over!” he blustered, shooting Guan Yu a look. “You’ll pay!”

Spotting Niu Le’s blade, the dean seized a safer target. “You! Drop that knife now!”

Niu Le thrust the blade toward the dean’s face. “Fuck off! Bark again and I’ll chop you too!”

The dean choked, eyes bulging. Never in his career had a student threatened him at knifepoint.

Guan Yu interjected coolly, “We’ll settle this ourselves.” He turned to Jin Xing. “Name your terms.”

“You crippled my brother! Today I brought these men. Want a real fight? I’ll summon every ally I have! We’ll see how long you four last! But know this—when we’re done, I’ll sever every tendon in your bodies!”

Liu Shilei gasped, clutching Guan Yu’s arm. The dean quivered. Yet Guan Yu only smirked. “Call them all. If your mob kills me, so be it. But I’ll die fighting, not cowering. Let’s go—now!” He shoved past Liu Shilei and grabbed Jin Xing’s arm, dragging him toward the stairs.

“Guan Yu, stop!” Liu Shilei pleaded.

“Don’t be rash!” the dean urged.

Ignoring them, Guan Yu hauled Jin Xing like a ragdoll. Jin Xing dug in his heels, panic rising. These lunatics actually wanted a death match! But with Guan Yu’s iron grip on his arm, resistance was futile.

One hotheaded gangster lunged at Guan Yu’s exposed back, dagger thrusting toward his kidney.

Niu Le’s blade arced faster. The knife bit into the attacker’s shoulder as the dagger grazed Guan Yu’s flank. Guan Yu spun, swinging Jin Xing’s body like a flail. The thug was smashed aside as Guan Yu’s spinning kick sent Jin Xing pirouetting through the air.

Niu Le, ever the opportunist, leaped and brought his blade down on Jin Xing’s calf mid-flight. Bone cracked. Jin Xing’s scream echoed as he crashed down.

“Up! Let’s go!” Guan Yu barked at the writhing Jin Xing.

Chapter 252: Arrogance and Provocation

Niu Le spat and raised his blade for another strike, halted by Guan Yu’s gesture. “Get up. Now.”

Jin Xing couldn’t walk, let alone stand. His pallid face contorted in agony. The dean watched dumbstruck. Jin Xing’s men cowered, paralyzed by Guan Yu’s ferocity.

Guan Yu kicked Jin Xing’s ribs. “Not so tough now? Where’s your big talk about cutting tendons?”

Another kick sent Jin Xing sprawling. “Want your nose broken too?” Guan Yu hauled him up and slammed his face into the marble floor—thud after sickening thud.

Rising, Guan Yu wiped blood from his hands. The corridor fell silent but for Jin Xing’s whimpers. Every witness—faculty, gangsters, students peering from doorways—stood frozen in horror.
