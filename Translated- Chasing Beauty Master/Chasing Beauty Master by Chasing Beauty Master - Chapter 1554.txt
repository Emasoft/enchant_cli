“Is this appropriate? A sect leader bullying a disciple who hasn’t even been initiated for a year? Have you no shame?” Elder Jiu remarked with evident displeasure. “Since Sect Leader Xiang made such a demand, you simply agreed?”

“Indeed,” Sect Leader Lu replied, clearly sensing Elder Jiu’s partiality toward Guan Yu. Having interacted with the elder before, Lu knew of his tendency to favor protégés he took a liking to. “The Sect Master approved it without hesitation.”

“Moreover,” Lu added pointedly, “the Sect Master himself served as their adjudicator during the confrontation.”

Elder Jiu shot a sidelong glance at Xuanming, his face etched with reproach. “Two century-old cultivators ganging up on a novice disciple? How utterly shameless! Were this disgraceful affair to spread beyond our gates, Yunqing Sect’s reputation would be irreparably tarnished.”

Xuanming glared resentfully at Sect Leader Lu, thinking, Must you fan these flames? Your loose tongue serves no purpose.

“This wasn’t my decision,” Xuanming explained. “Guan Yu’s own pride compelled him to accept. I questioned his resolve repeatedly, but he insisted with unwavering determination. What could I do?”

“The boy may be young, but are you a child too?” Elder Jiu retorted, his protective instincts flaring. When the elder chose to champion someone, reason held no sway. “Couldn’t you have dissuaded Sect Leader Xiang? Who would bear responsibility if the lad were maimed?” Though his words grew fiercer, his hands remained busy examining an ironstone.

Xuanming sighed. “Guan Yu’s stubbornness matched Sect Leader Xiang’s provocations. The Imperial Seal – your own masterpiece – intimidated Xiang into avoiding direct confrontation.”

“Though I assisted in stabilizing its spiritual matrix, the Imperial Seal belongs to Guan Yu!” Elder Jiu snapped. “Shouldn’t its wielder employ it freely? By your logic, must we discard our best weapons when enemies forbid their use? Preposterous! If Sect Leader Xiang acts the petty fool, must you play the dolt as well?”

Xuanming fell silent under the rebuke. Concealing his amusement, Sect Leader Lu interjected solemnly: “Guan Yu possesses remarkable fortitude and numerous treasures. His disregard for Sect Leader Xiang’s status led him to voluntarily relinquish the Imperial Seal.”

“Under normal circumstances, Guan Yu might stand a chance against Xiang,” Elder Jiu mused, stroking his beard. “But that old fox’s experience makes this no ordinary duel. How could you permit such recklessness?”

“Elder Jiu,” Xuanming countered, “the entire sect witnessed their confrontation. To openly contradict a sect leader would have undermined authority. Guan Yu’s public challenge left little room for intervention.”

A chuckle escaped the elder. “I admire that boy’s unyielding spirit! What others condemn as insubordination, I see as commendable resolve.” His approval transformed perceived impertinence into virtue. “Now recount the outcome.”

Xuanming resumed: “Guan Yu placed the Imperial Seal as wager – should Xiang prevail, he’d claim the artifact. If defeated, Xiang must expend fifty years’ cultivation to purge Xiao Zhi’s blood curse.”

Elder Jiu’s eyes softened. “To stake his treasure for a comrade’s sake... This child’s loyalty puts your petty squabbles to shame. Let this be your lesson – abandon scheming, emulate his fraternal devotion!”

Chapter 4030: Predestined Defeat

“Though young, Guan Yu demonstrates exceptional maturity,” Elder Jiu continued. “Xiao Zhi’s plight troubles me – the boy’s clearly wronged. As for Yan Zhao...” His voice hardened. “The fool’s ambition blinded me. Now he dances to the Demon Soul Sect’s tune, nullifying decades of our tutelage.”

Xuanming’s expression darkened. Yan Zhao’s betrayal cut deep, compounded by reports of his rising status among demonic forces. The sect master’s fists clenched at the thought of his former disciple thriving in wickedness.

Returning to the present, Elder Jiu praised: “Guan Yu’s fearless wager exemplifies true camaraderie. Most would shrink from challenging a sect leader, let alone stake their treasures.”

“The boy’s brilliance outshines common intellect,” Sect Leader Lu noted wryly. “Even without the Imperial Seal, he bested Xiang through cunning.”

“Oh? Detail this victory,” Elder Jiu demanded.

Xuanming hesitated before explaining: “Guan Yu unleashed a martial qi slash of staggering potency – the dual cultivation’s might stunned all witnesses. Though Xiang evaded, when preparing to counterattack...” He paused dramatically. “A single shot from Guan Yu’s handgun left the sect leader paralyzed.”

Elder Jiu burst into laughter. “The handgun! Without prior preparation, none could withstand it. No wonder the lad surrendered the Seal so readily! With such artifacts, Xiang never stood a chance.”

“You’re familiar with this weapon?” Sect Leader Lu inquired.

“Seen similar devices in another realm,” the elder replied cryptically. “In close quarters, even I couldn’t counter it. Xiang’s defeat was inevitable from the start.”

“After that demonstration,” Xuanming added, “none dare provoke Guan Yu. Later, we consulted Elder Wang of Zhenyang Sect about replicating the handgun. Though deemed impossible, Guan Yu devised an alternative – the crossbow.”

Elder Jiu’s curiosity piqued. “A crossbow? Demonstrate this invention!”

Producing the blacksteel weapon, Xuanming explained: “Guan Yu designed it, Elder Wang forged it. The prototype’s power surpasses expectations.”

Chapter 4031: Arduous Mission

Examining the crossbow, Elder Jiu marveled as a test bolt embedded itself twenty meters away in ancient jujube wood. “Remarkable! This child’s innovations never cease. Summon him immediately upon return!”

“He’s currently on a desert expedition to locate Miao City,” Xuanming revealed.

Elder Jiu frowned. “The Seventh Month deadline remains distant. Why dispatch him prematurely?”

“Imperial complications arise,” Xuanming explained. “The ailing emperor recalls Prince Zou – his once-disregarded savior. With rival princes scheming, Zou requested our aid. Among younger disciples, only Guan Yu possesses the competence for covert protection.”

Nodding approval, Elder Jiu advised: “Supporting Zou’s ascension benefits Yunqing Sect. Ensure continuous assistance until his coronation.”

As discussion shifted to ironstone refinement, the elder cautioned: “While superior materials aid crafting, the smith’s spiritual equilibrium proves paramount. Erratic qi flow breeds mediocrity.”

“But doesn’t ironstone guarantee success?” Sect Leader Lu questioned.

“Common misconception,” Elder Jiu corrected, holding a specimen to light. “Observe this bluish hue – deceptive translucence from refined reflectivity. True mastery requires harmony between material and artificer’s spirit.”

Xuanming produced the battle-worn armor. “Guan Yu purchased this for five million, discerning rare ironstone beneath its breastplate. Though scarred elsewhere, the core remains pristine – a discovery that astonished even Elder Wang.”

“Marvelous!” Elder Jiu exclaimed. “Yet another wonder from that boy! When he returns from safeguarding Prince Zou, I’ll have much to discuss. His desert mission – how long?”

“Months, perhaps,” Xuanming admitted. “The path to Miao City proves treacherous, and royal intrigues demand prolonged involvement. But with Guan Yu’s resourcefulness...” A proud smile surfaced. “Our sect’s future brightens daily through his endeavors.”
