“Good, that’s reassuring. In truth, Master of the Manor, my two junior brothers have deep ties with that demoness from the Mohist Sect. Back then, fearing they might err, I handed her over to your custody. You must keep her tightly secured—our victory over the Demon Soul Sect hinges on holding her hostage.”

“Young Hero Yan, rest assured. That demoness is in my grasp. Even if she grew wings, she couldn’t escape.” Manor Lord Lu added, “At present, there is another matter where I seek your assistance.”

“Speak freely, Manor Lord. What do you require?”

Lord Lu rose, forcing himself to appear composed before Yan Zhao. “I fear the Demon Soul Sect may stir again today. The Right Envoy’s formations are formidable. If they unleash a spell upon us unaware, we’ll be doomed. Thus, I ask you to investigate the situation outside the city.”

Yan Zhao knew the man sought to send him away to divert more manpower to hunt Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi. Yet refusing would arouse suspicion.

“I shall not shirk this duty.” Yan Zhao clasped his hands. For now, he couldn’t openly clash with the manor lord—not until the Young Mistress was rescued.

He regretted ever handing Wang Xiaorong over to Lord Lu. Who could have foreseen the Left Envoy learning of it?

As Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi hid in their room, a paper ball suddenly flew through the window. Guan Yu tensed, gripping his Soulfall Blade, but the outside remained eerily quiet. Xiao Zhi unfolded the note.

“Guan Yu, look! This says we should act tonight to rescue Wang Xiaorong. There’s even a map and instructions for opening the dungeon’s mechanisms.”

Guan Yu examined it. “Good. We move after dark.”

“Who sent this? Senior Brother Yan?” Xiao Zhi wondered. “We know no one else here.”

“Unlikely.” Guan Yu frowned. “Perhaps the Left Envoy? But he wouldn’t know the manor’s layout so thoroughly. Maybe a spy from the Demon Soul Sect planted here. Regardless, we’ll take this help. At nightfall, we strike.”

Guan Yu steeled himself. Tonight, he would save Wang Xiaorong at all costs. Another failure might push Lord Lu to kill her in desperation.

He refused to let her remain in peril. If necessary, he’d unleash the three remaining spells within the Imperial Seal—even if it meant razing the entire manor.

At dusk, impatience gnawed at him. “Xiao Zhi, let’s go. It’s time.”

Following the map’s markings, they slipped to the dungeon entrance. Oddly, only two guards stood watch. Had Xiaorong been moved?

Dread tightening his chest, Guan Yu knocked out the guards and entered.

“This feels wrong,” Xiao Zhi whispered. “Where are the defenses? Is this a trap?”

“Even if it is, I won’t abandon her.”

They reached a stone door. Per the instructions, Guan Yu twisted a torch-mounted lever. The door groaned open, revealing Xiaorong chained in shadows, blindfolded and slumped weakly.

Hearing the noise, she rasped, “Has that damned Lord Lu come to gloat again?”

“Xiaorong! It’s me!”

Her head jerked up. “Guan Yu? You’re here!”

“I’m getting you out. Xiao Zhi—the chains!”

As Xiao Zhi approached, Xiaorong cried, “Stop! It’s trapped—”

Too late. Hidden ports spat poisoned arrows from every wall. Guan Yu blurred into motion, deflecting projectiles aimed at Xiaorong while Xiao Zhi summoned a shimmering shield.

When the barrage ceased, Guan Yu exhaled—she was unharmed. Xiao Zhi’s shield flickered out.

“That was close,” Xiao Zhi muttered, only to step on a trigger plate. A cage crashed down, denting his skull.

“Son of a bitch!” He clutched his head. “Couldn’t they make it taller?!”

Guan宇 smirked. “Maybe Lord Lu built it for his own height.”

“Less jokes, more help!”

After freeing Xiaorong, they faced a new complication—the Mohist Sect’s Left Envoy arrived amidst the chaos, finding Lord Lu’s corpse.

“How did he die?” The Envoy eyed the peculiar wounds.

“Divine secrets aren’t for sharing,” Guan Yu deflected.

Outside, the Right Envoy confronted Guan Yu. “Young Mistress, you must return. If the Sect Master learns of your recklessness...”

Xiaorong dug in her heels. “I’m staying with Guan Yu!”

The Right Envoy softened. “Then invite him to our sect. Afterward...we’ll see.”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu agreed. “Once Xiao Zhi heals, I’ll visit.”

Xiaorong beamed. “Promise?”

“Have I ever lied?”

At the Demon Soul Sect, the Sect Master examined a crimson stone. “So this is the玄火石 (Mystic Fire Stone) Lord Lu stole. And he’s dead?”

The Left Envoy nodded. “By Guan Yu’s hand. His methods...are unconventional.”

When Xiaorong bounded in, her father glowered. “You dare return after nearly ruining everything?”

She hugged his arm. “But Father, Guan Yu saved me! You’ll like him—he’s brave and clever and—”

The Sect Master sighed. This “Guan Yu” had better be worth the trouble.
