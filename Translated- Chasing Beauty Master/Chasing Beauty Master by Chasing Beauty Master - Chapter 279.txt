“But in the end, he saw hope again—hope that he could vent his grievances himself. Because the police had arrived, and not just any officers, but those who usually called him ‘brother.’

He looked up at the police, and their gazes simultaneously fell upon him.

When Li Ming saw that the man wailing on the floor was none other than Luo Quanyuan, he froze momentarily before exclaiming in surprise, “Brother Quan, why is it you?”

However, he quickly realized how foolish his question was. He abruptly turned to Guan Yu, his face hardening as he demanded, “Did you beat these people?”

The sudden shift in the police’s attitude made Guan Yu immediately grasp the underlying reasons. He’d seen such things too many times before. He shrugged nonchalantly. “If you say so.”

“What kind of attitude is that?” the officer reprimanded.

Guan Yu chuckled coldly, glancing at the policeman with disdain. “What attitude do you expect? Whether I hit him or not, you’ve already decided I’m guilty. Isn’t that right?”

Li Ming’s expression darkened. This insolent brat had crossed a line. Some things were better left unspoken. Since he’d dared to voice them, he’d pay the price.

“You dare act this arrogantly after assaulting someone? Come with me to the station,” Li Ming barked.

“Did I admit to hitting anyone?” Guan Yu narrowed his eyes, smirking.

“The evidence is right here! We received a report of attempted murder at this location—undoubtedly you. Enough nonsense. Come quietly, or things will get ugly,” Li Ming snapped.

Guan Yu tilted his head, then nodded unexpectedly. “Fine. Take him away instead.” He pointed at Luo Quanyuan, still writhing on the floor. “He tried to kill my father. I stopped him. Legally, that’s self-defense. He’s the one guilty of attempted murder.”

Li Ming’s face twitched. He shot a glance at Luo Quanyuan, whose silence infuriated him. “You’re twisting facts! You injured two men—that’s undeniable!”

“Deny all you want,” Guan Yu said coldly. “But I have witnesses. Everyone here saw Luo Quanyuan and his thugs target my father. His injuries? He tripped. Arrest me, and you disgrace that uniform.”

“Lies!” Li Ming roared. “You’re under arrest!”

“What if I refuse?” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy.

“You don’t have a choice,” Li Ming sneered.

Guan Yu sighed. “You think he’s untouchable? Let’s test that.” He pulled out his phone. “Get the CEO of Hengxin Real Estate here in fifteen minutes.”

**Chapter 707: Guan Yu’s Power**

History shows that might makes right. Guan Yu, though young, understood this well.

Li Ming, blinded by superficial judgments, underestimated the youth. But when a panting, sweaty businessman burst into the room, reality shifted.

The man—De Ge, a local magnate—savagely kicked Luo Quanyuan, cursing. “You idiot! You’ve provoked someone even the mayor fears!”

Luo Quanyuan cowered, bewildered. De Ge turned to Guan Yu, groveling. “Sir, my deepest apologies. Let me make amends.” He offered a check.

Guan Yu ignored it. “Handle this properly. Attempted murder carries consequences.”

De Ge paled. “Of course! This fool will pay.” He descended on Luo Quanyuan again.

Guan Yu watched coldly. Justice, however twisted, would prevail.
