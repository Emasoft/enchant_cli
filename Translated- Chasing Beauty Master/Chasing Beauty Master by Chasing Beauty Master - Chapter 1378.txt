Guan Yu walked alone on the path in good spirits, idly twirling the Imperial Seal in his hand. He truly hadn't anticipated the terrifying power of the arcane techniques sealed within this artifact. Not only had it incapacitated Elder Xiang, but the shockwaves had even shattered the doors and windows behind him. The sheer destructive force was awe-inspiring.

Being assigned to the back mountains suited his plans perfectly. This arrangement allowed him to meet Wang Xiaorong in the forested slopes. He still marveled at how she'd managed to slip a note into his quarters without his detection—an alarming security lapse. Had the infiltrator harbored malicious intent, he might already be paying respects to King Yama in the underworld.

It seemed even nighttime rest required heightened vigilance now. The perceptual awareness of immortal practitioners paled in comparison to martial cultivators when it came to sensing external threats. The absence of Second-to-Wolf, his loyal guardian, left him particularly exposed. With that keen-nosed companion present, no intruder could have approached his chambers undetected—a stark reminder of the gulf between immortal and martial cultivation.

As Guan Yu strolled, he feigned casual sightseeing while mentally charting his route. Meeting Wang Xiaorong took priority before reporting to his mountain confinement—once sequestered in the back peaks, escape would prove difficult. Cutting through the forest behind Tiger Head Peak's rear courtyard offered both efficiency and potential diversion.

Midway through the woods, daylight revealed tendrils of white smoke curling skyward. The tantalizing aroma of roasted meat prickled his nostrils. Guan Yu frowned—could Xiao Zhi and A'Ze have arrived so quickly? They'd been in the main hall mere moments ago. Stealth became paramount as he ghosted forward, each footfall silent as falling snow.

Approaching the source, he discerned a lithe figure in black tending a spit—the curve of hips and posture unmistakably feminine even from behind. Recognition dawned before she turned. "Who's there?!" Wang Xiaorong's sharp cry pierced the air as she spun toward his hiding spot.

Emerging from behind a pine with rueful chuckle, Guan Yu remarked, "Impressive vigilance. I thought I'd been quieter than a shadow."

"Quiet? You were practically breathing down my neck!" She pouted, gesturing at the cooking fire. "Were you an assassin, I'd be skewered by now. What brings you at this hour? Our meeting was set for dusk."

"Your culinary siren song proved irresistible." He nodded at the crackling spit. "Aren't you concerned about Cloud Azure Sect patrols?"

Wang Xiaorong tossed her hair defiantly. "Let them come! Your sect's lumbering oafs couldn't catch me if I limped backwards. Besides—" Her eyes glinted mischievously, "Would you truly arrest me?"

"Don't underestimate Cloud Azure," Guan Yu's voice chilled abruptly, posture shifting combat-ready. "Were I here on official duty..."

"You wouldn't." She met his gaze unflinching. "Even if captured by your hand, I'd prefer it to other alternatives."

Her unwavering trust silenced him. Redirecting conversation, he gestured at the sizzling game. "Your skills surprise me. That fragrance could resurrect the dead. May I?"

"Patience, glutton!" She slapped his reaching hand. "Half-raw meat breeds illness. Proper cooking requires time and care—high heat purges harmful spirits."

Guan Yu paused mid-retreat. The terminology—'harmful spirits' instead of 'bacteria'—yet the concept mirrored modern hygiene principles. Before he could question, she continued, "Sit! The wine jars won't drink themselves."

His observant gaze noted dual portions—two pheasants on the spit, twin wine vessels. "You anticipated my early arrival."

"Pure coincidence," she demurred, basting the fowl. "Merely preparing for a lonely supper. Though..." A sly smile crept across her features, "Perhaps the forest spirits whispered of your haste."

"Let's call it culinary impatience," he deflected, accepting a wineskin. As amber liquid burned down his throat, the conversation turned earnest.

"Your punishment—what transpired?" Wang Xiaorong's brow furrowed. "After your merits at Treasure Mountain, why confinement?"

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. "Elder Xiang's petty machinations. The man's reputation for grudges precedes him, it seems."

"Like recognizes like." She snorted. "That miser's renowned for counting grains of rice. Your sect leaks information like a sieve—we know every prominent figure. Except you." Her gaze intensified. "A meteoric rise—no history, yet mastering both immortal and martial arts overnight. Who are you truly, Guan Yu?"

"Merely an insignificant disciple." He shrugged. "Nothing worth your intrigue."

"Everything about you intrigues me!" Leaning forward, her sleeve brushed his arm. "Your preferences, habits, dreams—I'd memorize them all to bridge the chasm between us."

Guan Yu cleared his throat. "Regarding Elder Xiang—is he your pawn?"

"Not to my knowledge." Her response came crisp. "Father and the Left Envoy handle such arrangements. Honestly—" She gestured expansively, "Why cling to this stagnant sect? Join us! No petty elders would dare harass you in Soul Demon Sect."

"Never." The refusal rang steel-clad. "I tolerate no threats. Should Elder Xiang provoke me again, his head shall adorn my gate."

Wang Xiaorong's eyes narrowed contemplatively. A dangerous idea took root—if Cloud Azure's covert operatives harassed Guan Yu relentlessly, perhaps he'd abandon this den of hypocrites. Yet knowing his temperament, such scheming might backfire spectacularly.

Changing tack, she probed, "What binds you here? Some... lingering attachment?" Her voice turned singsong. "Perhaps a certain Senior Sister Siqi?"

Guan Yu nearly choked on his wine. "Don't be absurd! Senior Sister merely guides my training."

"Women perceive what men overlook." She sprinkled spices with exaggerated nonchalance. "Her eyes linger when you practice sword forms. The way she 'accidentally' brings double portions to your quarters..."

"Enough!" Heat crept up his neck. "Even if true, I'd never let romantic entanglements dictate my path. Should I depart, it would be by choice—not dragged by skirt-strings."

"Famous last words." Wang Xiaorong's laughter tinkled like wind chimes before abruptly sobering. "Disaster! The pheasants—"

He lunged toward the fire, only to find perfectly bronzed birds. Her follow-up whisper froze him mid-reach: "The catastrophe is this—I find myself falling deeper for you daily. What remedy exists?"

"Wang Xiaorong..." He massaged his temples. "Cloud Azure can never accept you. Our paths—"

"Spare the lecture." She tore a drumstick with more force than necessary. "You think me unaware? Yet here I remain—shameless as a stray cat, savoring crumbs of your company." Changing subject abruptly, she brandished the spit. "Eat! Before I retract my generosity."

As juices dripped onto coals, their conversation drifted to weightier matters. Guan Yu casually inquired, "The Eight-Drum Technique's foreign energies—why can't I assimilate them?"

"Father handles my cultivation." She shrugged. "Seek Master Xuanming's guidance."

"Impossible!" His fist clenched. "If Cloud Azure discovers I possess demonic techniques—"

"Expulsion? Execution?" Her eyes lit with dangerous inspiration. Guan Yu's glare extinguished the notion before voiced.

"Let's discuss that cloth from the underground palace," he redirected. "The demonic script mentioned 'Golden City beneath Divine Stone Mountain'—any insights?"

Wang Xiaorong's smile turned feline. "Interrogating me now? Your sect's Elder Zheng deciphered it days ago!"

"Yet comprehension eludes us all," he pressed. "The lines about blooming seasons and fragrant winds—"

"Speculation only." She licked grease from fingers. "Flower-bloom likely references seasonal timing for treasure manifestation. The rest..." A dismissive wave. "Perhaps your Senior Sister's beauty distracts you from—"

Guan Yu's groan cut her off. As bickering resumed beneath the pine canopy, neither noticed the shadow detaching from a distant tree—a spy bearing urgent reports to Elder Xiang's quarters.
