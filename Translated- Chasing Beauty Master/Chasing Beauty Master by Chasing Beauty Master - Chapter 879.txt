“Ah, I’m fine. There’s no need to fuss like this, okay? Don’t bother telling my sisters—they’ve probably already heard.” Guanyu sighed wearily.

Amei, being the most timid, had been too terrified to look. She’d locked herself in the bathroom, weeping uncontrollably despite Xue Jing’s attempts to console her.

“Amei, it’s alright. Guanyu just suffered minor internal injuries. He’ll recover after resting a few days. Stop crying now, be a good girl.” After settling Guanyu, Xue Jing hurried to comfort Amei in the bathroom.

“Sister Jing… do you think Guanyu might die? If he dies… what will I do? Wuwuwu…” Amei sobbed pitifully.

Xue Jing hadn’t expected Amei to be this frightened. “It’s not that serious. I just examined him—he’ll recover completely after resting at home. Don’t let your imagination run wild.”

When Guanyu had returned, his clothes had indeed been drenched in blood. The white shirt he’d worn to Meimei’s wedding was particularly striking with its crimson stains. However, the blood wasn’t his—it had sprayed from Ma He when Second-to-Wolf eviscerated him during the battle.

“Sister Jing, are you sure? But I saw so much blood on him… I was scared to death…” Amei’s tears began flowing anew.

Xue Jing was running out of comforting strategies when Zhang Han bounded into the room. “Sister Amei! Big Brother wants you, but he says he won’t see you if you keep crying!”

The words worked like magic. Amei immediately stifled her sobs. “Guanyu wants me? Then I’ll stop! I’ll stop!”

After taking several deep breaths to compose herself, Amei nodded shakily while Xue Jing reassured her: “Trust me, Guanyu will be fine. Have I ever lied to you?”

“But Sister Jing… what if something really happens to him outside someday? We can’t let him go out so casually anymore…” Amei fretted.

“Let’s worry about that later. For now, go see him.” Xue Jing gently wiped Amei’s tears as the girl struggled to maintain composure.

Lying in bed with Yang Conghan and Lü Mei tending to him, Guanyu suddenly noticed Amei’s absence. “Where’s Amei? Is she not home?”

Lü Mei adjusted his blankets tenderly. “She’s been hiding in the bathroom crying since she saw you covered in blood. You know how timid she is—the sight terrified her.”

Realizing he’d frightened the poor girl, Guanyu immediately sent Zhang Han to fetch her.

“Guanyu… are you okay? *Sniff*…” Amei entered hesitantly, her eyes swollen from crying. Seeing him clean and resting calmly, she managed a trembling smile.

“Come here, let me see. Were you scared silly?” Guanyu chuckled. Amei nodded earnestly, approaching the bedside. “I thought… all that blood was yours… My soul nearly left my body!”

“Don’t worry—it wasn’t my blood. Look, no wounds at all.” Guanyu tried lifting the blanket to show her, but a sudden movement sent sharp pain through his injured body.

Coughing violently, he triggered a flurry of concern from the women gathered around. “Are you alright?” “Why did you move?” “Be more careful!”

Amei’s tears returned in force, though she desperately tried to suppress them. Heart aching at her distress, Guanyu gritted through the pain: “Just… open the blanket. Let her see.”

“No need! I believe you!” Amei rushed to hold the bedding in place. “Just… just stay safe.”

“Silly girl, I’ll be fine.” Guanyu smiled fondly. Amei’s fragility always moved him—she couldn’t even bear to attack cute monsters in video games.

Nodding vigorously like a bobblehead, Amei suddenly remembered: “You must be starving! I’ll make your favorite shrimp soup!” Her tear-soaked nightgown and panda-like swollen eyes didn’t diminish her determination.

The mention of food reminded Guanyu of his empty stomach—he’d barely eaten at the wedding lunch, and it was now past 2 AM. “Actually… I am rather hungry. That sounds perfect.”

As Xue Jing and Amei busied themselves in the kitchen, even mischievous Zhang Han unusually refrained from pestering Guanyu, instead choosing to “help” with meal preparations—a rare display of consideration for his injuries.

Amei carefully spoon-fed Guanyu before the group finally retired for the night. He slept straight through until the next afternoon, waking considerably refreshed.

When he tried rising, Xue Jing immediately stopped him. “Don’t move! You need complete rest—your body’s still weak.”

Blushing slightly at the circle of watchful women, Guanyu admitted: “But… I really need to pee.”

Chapter 2250: Let Him Escape

“Pee? That’s simple enough.” Xue Jing nodded to Zhang Han, who pounced onto the bed with her usual exuberance.

“Careful!” Amei cried, but Zhang Han had already yanked off Guanyu’s blankets and begun tugging at his pants, even playfully flicking his member once exposed.

Lü Mei produced a bedpan while the others rolled Guanyu sideways, positioning the receptacle. Xue Jing grinned mischievously: “Go ahead, relieve yourself freely~”

Guanyu’s face burned crimson. Though embarrassed, he consoled himself that these were his closest companions—none would dare mock him openly. After finishing, he sighed: “Ah… much better.”

The women burst into giggles, Zhang Han theatrically pinching her nose: “I wonder how Big Brother’s pee smells~!”

After the commotion died down, Guanyu drifted back to sleep, the healing process demanding constant rest. Outside his recovery room, plots unfolded—Qiongsi and Second-to-Wolf hunted relentlessly for the elusive shimei (younger martial sister), whose escape skills proved formidable.

Despite Qiongsi’s network combing Gan City’s mountainous terrain, the shimei remained elusive. When Second-to-Wolf finally cornered her in a dilapidated mountain hut, she employed cunning decoys—multiple clones fleeing in different directions across the rugged landscape.

Chapter 2251: Smarter Than You

Tracking the fleeing clones, Second-to-Wolf thundered through dense eastern forests, creating deliberate noise to lull the shimei into false security. Meanwhile, her true self hid in the sparser western hills, smugly congratulating herself: “What good is First-Class Adept status? Still outwitted by this old lady~”

Her triumph proved short-lived. Second-to-Wolf materialized behind her, blade gleaming crimson: “Clever… but I’m cleverer. The eastern commotion was mere distraction.”

As the shimei summoned clone duplicates, Second-to-Wolf’s bloodied sword hummed with lethal intent. “Any last questions?”

The shimei’s voice trembled: “Just one… How?”
