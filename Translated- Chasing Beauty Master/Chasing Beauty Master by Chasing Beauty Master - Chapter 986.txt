At this moment, none of the Yu Gang brothers retreated. They all stood tall with chests puffed out, appearing ready for battle.

Chen Yaofei had initially intended to intimidate these street punks with his well-trained men. He expected his subordinates' mere presence would send these cowards fleeing. Yet to his astonishment, not a single opponent flinched. Their faces showed no trace of fear – only the contemptuous expressions of people staring at fools.

The humiliating situation made Senior Brother Chen's face flush crimson. He roared, "I'll grant you one chance! Kneel and beg for mercy now, and I might spare you today!"

His domineering words infuriated the Yu Gang members, particularly the alcohol-fueled Jia Bo. With a crash of shattering glass, Jia Bo smashed his beer bottle against the table edge and charged toward Chen while brandishing the jagged remains.

As he passed Guanyu, the latter seized his arm. "Boss, let me go! I'll cripple that bastard!" Jia Bo shouted urgently.

Guanyu shook his head calmly. "Patience. We heard his terms. If they kneel now, we might still show mercy."

Though seething at the insult – unprecedented since Yu Gang's establishment in City A – Jia Bo recognized Guanyu's strategic wisdom. Still, he hurled his broken bottle at Chen near the entrance, snarling, "Fuck your mother! Either kill me today or kneel and kowtow till I'm satisfied!"

The spinning shards traced a perfect arc toward Chen's head – remarkable accuracy for someone swaying drunk.

**Chapter 2521: Between a Rock and a Hard Place**

Under normal circumstances, such aim wouldn't surprise. But Jia Bo's alcohol-saturated state made this feat extraordinary. Guanyu intervened because he sensed Chen's cultivation level surpassed even Fang Ding's. Charging blindly would get Jia Bo maimed.

Liquid courage emboldened Jia Bo, especially with Guanyu present. But Guanyu wouldn't let his subordinate walk into slaughter. Engaging these trained fighters now would mean casualties among their untrained, non-cultivator ranks.

Stalling bought time. Guanyu hadn't anticipated Fang Ding recruiting such formidable backup. These guards' professionalism hinted at the Chen family's significant influence.

Chen sidestepped the projectile gracefully, shattering it behind him. His fluid evasion revealed expert skill, sobering the Yu Gang members. Jia Bo privately thanked Guanyu's restraint – charging would've meant shattered teeth.

"Is this your best?" Chen taunted smugly. "Come fight if you dare, drunkard!"

His calculated display aimed to impress Fang Ding and intimidate opponents. As a Second-Class Venerable Lower Tier cultivator – surpassing even Fang Ding – Chen represented supreme prowess to ordinary eyes.

Jia Bo faced impossible choices: face brutal defeat before his men or suffer humiliating retreat. Guanyu rescued him with a commanding, "Stand down!"

"Yes, Boss!" Jia Bo complied theatrically, then jabbed a finger at Chen. "Enjoy your arrogance while it lasts, fucker!"

Chen's smirk faded as he recognized Guanyu. "So you're Guanyu? Be civilized – kneel before Junior Sister Fang with three kowtows, and we'll spare you."

Fang Ding interjected, "Surrender the recordings, and this ends now."

Guanyu rose leisurely. "Your concern touches me, Miss Fang. But you oversimplify."

When Chen demanded explanations about the compromising recordings, Guanyu smiled. "Shall I share how the Fang family bribed officials? Or their human trafficking ventures?"

"Speak and you die tonight!" Fang Ding shrieked.

Chen's eyes glinted with opportunity. "Give us the recordings, or suffer!"

"You overestimate yourself," Guanyu stated coldly. "Leave now or perish."

Enraged, Chen ordered the attack. Bottles became improvised weapons as Yu Gang members clashed with trained guards.

Chen lunged at Guanyu with a skull-crushing punch – only to meet a thunderous impact as Qiongsi materialized, kicking him through a warehouse wall.

"Move and I shoot!" Xue Jing pressed her gun to Fang Ding's temple.

**Chapter 2522: Wasted Breath**

The battlefield froze. Jia Bo smashed a bottle over an opponent's head, roaring, "Who else wants their skull cracked?"

The guards' resolve crumbled seeing their master unconscious and Fang Ding captured. These weren't battles worth dying for.

"Enough!" Guanyu's command halted his bloodthirsty men. He turned to Xue Jing holding Fang Ding at gunpoint. The cultivator's face twisted in bitter realization – she'd underestimated Guanyu's devilish cunning and his cadre of extraordinary women.

**Chapter 2523: Unforgivable Insolence**

As Yu Gang members jeered at cowering opponents, Guanyu contemplated the fallen Chen. Qiongsi's timely arrival – summoned earlier via discreet message – had turned the tide. Her First-Class Venerable cultivation easily overpowered Chen's Second-Class prowess.

Fang Ding seethed on the floor, recalling Kang's warnings about provoking this wolf in sheep's clothing. But regrets came too late – the wolf had bared its fangs.
