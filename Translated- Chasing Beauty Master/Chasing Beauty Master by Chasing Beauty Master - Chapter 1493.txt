“With Wang Xiaorong’s influence, Guan Yu’s reputation had already spread throughout the entire Mo Soul Sect. Moreover, Wang Xiaorong had openly declared her profound affection for Guan Yu, leaving no room for doubt.

The disciple tasked with delivering letters received daily updates about Guan Yu, though most were trivial or unrelated messages, which grew increasingly irritating.

But this newly arrived letter bore Guan Yu’s name unmistakably on its surface—clearly intended for the Young Mistress. Even if it cost him his head, the messenger dared not delay delivering it to her immediately.

The guards of the Mo Soul Sect were divided into three tiers: outer, middle, and inner. The outermost layer comprised the lowest-ranked disciples, responsible for menial tasks like gatekeeping and cleaning—the largest section of the sect.

The middle tier consisted of advanced novices who had earned formal disciple status. They enjoyed unrestricted access to the sect’s cultivation techniques and received generous treatment, as the sect openly imparted knowledge without reservation.

The innermost layer housed the sect’s elite—Hall Masters, Incense Masters, and the Left and Right Envoys when not on missions. The deepest sanctum belonged solely to the Demon Lord and Wang Xiaorong. No one, save the Envoys, could enter without permission—a rule never broken in all these years.

Outer guards were forbidden from entering the middle tier, and middle-tier guards could not breach the inner circle. All matters had to be relayed step by step; violating this hierarchy meant defying sect law.

The guard clutching the letter marked “Guan Yu” raised it high like a battle standard, charging through the ranks while bellowing, “Make way! Clear the path! Urgent letter from Guan Yu for the Young Mistress—it cannot wait!”

Clutching the letter as if it were a treasure map to riches, he barreled forward unchallenged, Guan Yu’s name acting as a talisman. Those slow to react were shoved aside without mercy.

A shoved disciple stamped his foot in fury, shouting at the retreating figure, “You courting death? An outer guard barging into the middle tier—have you lost your mind?”

Bystanders watched silently, recognizing the futility of obstruction. Delaying a matter involving Guan Yu and the Young Mistress spelled professional suicide in the sect.

The guard sprinted to the inner circle, nearly colliding with the Left Envoy. Seizing the messenger’s arm, the Envoy spun him around.

“Out of my way! This is Guan Yu’s urgent letter for the Young Mistress!” the guard panted.

Noting the genuine “Guan Yu” inscription, the Left Envoy released him. “I won’t fault you. Such diligence might earn the Young Mistress’ favor. Proceed.”

Stammering apologies to the Envoy, the guard resumed his dash to the restricted quarters. At the threshold, he halted and shouted, “Young Mistress! An urgent letter from Guan Yu awaits your attention!”

Wang Xiaorong, leisurely playing chess with the Demon Lord, perked up at the distant commotion. Though absorbed in the game, the name “Guan Yu” electrified her.

The Demon Lord barely glanced up. “Who dares cause such a ruckus?”

“Young Mistress! Urgent correspondence from Guan Yu!”

Before the words faded, Wang Xiaorong bolted outside, abandoning the chessboard.

The outer guard, breathless but triumphant, presented the letter. “Young Mistress, I rushed here without regard for boundaries. Please forgive the intrusion.”

“Guan Yu wrote to me? Truly?” Wang Xiaorong nearly leaped for joy, clutching the envelope marked with two cherished characters. Suppressing her excitement, she asked coolly, “Your name?”

“Ah Mao, Young Mistress. I knew any matter involving Guan Yu demanded immediate action.”

“Ah Mao,” she smiled, removing a golden hairpin. “Take this as reward—but next time, use proper channels.”

Trembling, Ah Mao accepted the priceless gift. Wang Xiaorong vanished before he finished stammering thanks.

Alone in her chambers, she tore open the letter. The first page read:

*“Xiaorong, it’s Guan Yu. Have you missed me these past days?”*

“Every second!” she cried aloud, heart racing.

The letter continued, detailing human trafficking in a remote town near Zhouji City. Guan Yu requested her aid in mobilizing authorities without direct confrontation.

*“Time is critical. Send someone influential to petition the City Lord. Lives hang in the balance. When your envoy arrives, find me in Zhouji City for further counsel. I… miss you.”*

The closing line undid her composure. “I’m coming, Guan Yu! Wait for me!”

She burst into the Demon Lord’s chamber, waving the letter. “Father! Guan Yu needs me in Zhouji City—I must go!”

Resigned, the Demon Lord nodded. “Take the Left Envoy. And child… finish our game when you return.”

As Wang Xiaorong and the Left Envoy soared toward Zhouji City, Guan Yu’s party arrived under night’s cover.

“Abandon the carriage,” Guan Yu instructed Liu Yun. “Too conspicuous.”

Wang Jun, who had secured lodgings, greeted them. “All arranged. Let’s dine and discuss.”

In their private room, Liu Yun marveled at the opulence while Guan Yu and Wang Jun bantered about expenses.

“Spoil yourself,” Wang Jun teased. “Guan Yu’s coffers run deep.”

“You’re footing this bill,” Guan Yu retorted. “Or did you squander Elder Lu’s gold already?”

Liu Yun, misreading the jest, offered her gold leaf. “Let me contribute, please.”

Guan Yu gently refused. “Save your resources. We’re here to ensure such sacrifices end.”

As the city slept, forces converged—Wang Xiaorong’s determination winging through the night, Guan Yu’s resolve steeling in the lamplit inn. The game against darkness had begun.
