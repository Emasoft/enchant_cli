Xiao Zhi scratched his head with an embarrassed chuckle. "Heheh, knew I couldn't fool you. Truth is, I needed someone to cheer me on today. Had to trick you into waking up somehow."

Guan Yu pointed at him teasingly. "You rascal, at least you've got some brains in that head."

From their vantage point on Xuanyuan Peak, Elder Zheng spotted Xiao Zhi and began waving vigorously. A'ze called out, "Master's summoning us. We should hurry over."

"You go ahead," Guan Yu said, already turning towards Tiger Head Peak. "I'll check on Ling Su's condition first. Need to help A'ze size up the competition properly."

Approaching the elevated viewing platform where his master sat, Guan Yu couldn't help marveling at the absurdly massive chair – a two-meter-tall monstrosity towering over the half-meter-high arena. Presumably designed for optimal viewing, though its proportions bordered on ridiculous.

Bowing respectfully, Guan Yu greeted, "Good morning, Master."

Xuanyuan Ming nodded, his gaze fixed on the arena below. "You're just in time. The first semifinal match begins shortly. Care to join me up here? The vantage point's excellent."

Surveying the scene, Guan Yu noted spectators kept five meters back from the arena – a sensible precaution against stray spells. Only Xuanyuan Ming's elevated throne dared perch at the very edge.

"Master, are you officiating today's matches?"

"Indeed," the elder confirmed, excitement coloring his voice. "These semifinals warrant personal oversight. It's been too long since I witnessed our disciples' progress firsthand."

As the appointed hour arrived, Xuanyuan Ming raised his hand commandingly. "Silence!" The courtyard's murmurs ceased instantly, demonstrating the elder's authority.

**Chapter 3304: Unity**

"Today marks the final day of our Six Peaks Tournament. From eight elite disciples, four champions shall emerge." Xuanyuan Ming's voice carried across the assembly. "The quarterfinalists are: Guan Yu, Lin Chen, and Ling Su from Tiger Head Peak; Siqi and Xiaolian from Convergence Peak; A'ze and Xiao Zhi from Xuanyuan Peak; Jiang Chao from Bamboo Forest Peak."

After reiterating known regulations displayed yesterday, the elder revealed floating artifacts that shimmered with spiritual energy. "The final four shall each select one of these superior magical tools. Furthermore..." He paused dramatically, "As tradition dictates, they'll receive empowerment from our sect's sacred Merit Cauldron – a rare opportunity to enhance their cultivation!"

The crowd buzzed with anticipation as Xuanyuan Ming outlined match pairings. Tiger Head Peak's strong showing – three representatives in the final eight – clearly pleased him.

**Chapter 3305: Endless Wine**

Guan Yu stood somewhat isolated among his sparse Tiger Head contingent. Ling Su's loud jibe carried clearly: "Some mutts prance about thinking themselves favored, forgetting they're still wet-behind-the-ears whelps!"

The barb went unanswered until Elder Lu approached unexpectedly. "Trouble sleeping, Guan Yu? You look peaky."

"Merely stayed up late, Uncle Lu. Then early visitors..." Guan Yu's reply drew astonished whispers – such personal attention from a peak elder was unprecedented.

Their conversation about Second Wolf's food poisoning ("He devoured an entire boar's organs last night – including the penis!") drew envious glares from Ling Su's faction. The envy intensified when Elder Dai joined them, discussing Xiaolian's planned concession.

"Save your Emperor Seal's power," Dai advised conspiratorially. "No sense wasting it on formalities."

Guan Yu's quiet thanks for the potent liquor gift prompted Dai's chuckle: "Tell Second Wolf my cellars never empty. He's always welcome."

**Chapter 3306: Expected Outcomes**

Elder Zheng's subsequent approach completed Guan Yu's social triumph. "My son and A'ze are fortunate in their friendship with you," the Xuanyuan leader murmured. "A word about Jiang Chao's tactics for A'ze?"

"His Windwhisper Dagger favors feints," Guan Yu whispered back. "Anchor defenses low."

As Xiao Zhi hefted his peculiar bovine femur artifact onto the arena, Guan Yu suppressed a smile. The legendary weapon's origin story – a stubborn spirit ox that starved itself to death rather than be tamed – explained its fierce aura. Xuanyuan Ming's voice boomed:

"Let the first semifinal commence!"
