“Captain Yu, that underground dungeon is simply a hellhole. Not only is it dark and freezing, but it’s also filled with so many torture devices. If you still refuse to confess now, I’ll report this matter to the higher-ups. When they discover such a dungeon exists in the yamen’s backyard, do you think you’ll escape the consequences?”



Magistrate Pang had yet to speak, but Young Master Li was already indignant. This fellow spent his days indulging in food, drink, and pleasure. Though born into a wealthy family, he had never studied properly and had been spoiled since childhood.



Moreover, he knew nothing of laws or regulations. He hadn’t realized the severity of his crimes, dismissing them as trivial matters that money could resolve. At worst, he thought he’d spend some time in jail, where his family’s wealth would ensure he lived comfortably, without suffering.



“I say, Captain Yu—are you truly this foolish? Who doesn’t have secrets in their backyard? It’s just a dungeon. Why make such a fuss?” Young Master Li declared arrogantly.



“What a joke!” Guanyi interjected loudly. “Are you an idiot or just brainless? No wonder your father disdains you. You’re nothing but a fool. How can you compare a private family’s backyard to the yamen’s?!”



“What’s the difference? Even if there’s a dungeon in the backyard, does that make it a crime?” Young Master Li retorted. Magistrate Pang nudged him, signaling him to stop talking. Usually shrewd, Young Master Li now seemed utterly senseless.



Captain Yu smiled. “Such a place would horrify anyone. Whether in the yamen’s backyard or a private residence, it’s inexcusable. How would you explain its purpose? To harm others? If exposed, you’d face fines and seals!”



“Why can’t I have one? My backyard has the same! I enjoy such things—since when is that your concern?” Young Master Li sneered, deliberately provoking.



**Chapter 3913: The Grace of Saving a Life**



Guanyi had visited the Li family’s backyard when Patriarch Li gifted him a carriage. Though he hadn’t noticed anything unusual then, an underground dungeon might indeed exist.



Magistrate Pang grew intrigued. “You say your backyard has one too? Perfect. I’ll send men to investigate. Let’s see if your dungeon holds prisoners.”



Young Master Li stood silent, defiance etched on his face. Captain Yu dispatched men to the Li estate for a thorough inspection.



Wang Jun seized the moment to address the women: “Can you identify who imprisoned you?” They unanimously pointed at Young Master Li, their resentment palpable.



Magistrate Pang felt a flicker of relief—no one had accused him yet.



Little Plum Blossom pointed at Magistrate Pang. “This man visited the dungeon yesterday, claiming he’d buy us.”



Guanyi corrected, “Last night, they conspired to frighten you. Their threats were mere tactics to break your resistance. Had you not been rescued, you’d have been sold to prearranged buyers.”



The women, still shaken, thanked their rescuers. Guanyi redirected their gratitude: “Thank Captain Yu. He led this rescue. I merely assisted.”



The women bowed to Captain Yu. “Thank you for saving us, sir.”



Captain Yu swelled with pride. This case—his largest yet—filled him with honor.



Observing the rescued women, he noted their beauty. If trained as slaves, they’d fetch high prices. Even he might’ve secretly purchased such “merchandise.”



Guanyi urged, “Seek justice. Accompany Captain Yu to testify. Your suffering must be heard.”



Magistrate Pang, desperate, whispered, “Might I visit the latrine?”



Captain Yu ordered guards to escort him. Guanyi nodded to Wang Jun to follow, ensuring Magistrate Pang didn’t flee.



Outside, confusion reigned. The yamen’s staff gaped as their superiors were arrested. Guanyi addressed the crowd: “Your magistrate and Young Master Li enslaved women, training them as slaves for profit. If anyone knows of this, step forward!”



No one volunteered. Young Master Li sneered, “You’ve no proof! Even if true, only Captain Yu holds authority here. Who are you?”



Captain Yu interjected, “Guanyi is both witness and informant. He alerted Prefectural Governor, who tasked me to assist him.”



Guanyi pressed, “Testify against them, and receive protection and reward. Silence makes you accomplices.”



As murmurs arose, a soldier entered: “Captain Yu, Patriarch Li obstructed our search. He’s here now.”



**Chapter 3914: Daren’s Dilemma**



Patriarch Li stormed in, roaring, “Who dares trespass my estate without the Prefectural Governor’s warrant?!”



“Father, save me!” Young Master Li cried.



Captain Yu barked, “Silence! This is a court of law. You will remain subdued!”



**Chapter 3915: Patriarch Li’s Intervention**



Patriarch Li’s arrival shifted the tension. Young Master Li’s defiance resurged, emboldened by his father’s presence.



Guanyi observed the standoff. Patriarch Li’s authority clashed with Captain Yu’s resolve. The crowd held its breath, awaiting the outcome.



Patriarch Li glared at Captain Yu. “Without a warrant, your intrusion is unlawful. Release my son, or face repercussions!”



Captain Yu stood firm. “Evidence of crimes on your estate justifies our search. Resist, and you’ll join your son in chains.”



The standoff intensified. Guanyi stepped forward. “Patriarch Li, your son’s crimes are exposed. Cooperate, or share his fate.”



Patriarch Li’s gaze flickered. Behind his bluster, uncertainty lurked. The soldiers tightened their grip on Young Master Li.



Wang Jun whispered to Guanyi, “Patriarch Li’s influence runs deep. Without irrefutable proof, this could backfire.”



Guanyi nodded. “The dungeon’s existence will damn them. Once uncovered, even Patriarch Li cannot shield his son.”



The soldiers returned, reporting, “Captain Yu, we found the dungeon. It matches the description—chains, torture devices, and evidence of trafficking.”



Patriarch Li paled. Young Master Li’s bravado crumbled. Magistrate Pang slumped, defeated.



Captain Yu declared, “Arrest Patriarch Li. All conspirators will face Prefectural Governor’s judgment.”



As the Li family’s downfall unfolded, the crowd erupted in whispers. Justice, long delayed, finally descended on the corrupt.



Guanyi watched, satisfied. The rescued women wept with relief. Their nightmare had ended.



The road to justice, though fraught, had prevailed. Captain Yu’s integrity and Guanyi’s resolve had unearthed the rot festering in the yamen’s shadows.



The tale of greed and redemption would echo through the town, a testament to resilience against tyranny.
