“I don’t know whether to feel glad or troubled,” Liu Yun murmured. While she was relieved someone had finally stepped forward to help their besieged town, she couldn’t shake her unease at letting Guan Yu and Wang Jun take such risks for a cause unrelated to them.

The memories of their once-harmonious town now felt like fragments of heaven shattered into hell. Since those creatures had descended, life had withered day by day. With her husband slain and survival growing harsher, Liu Yun feared the entire town would soon crumble unless someone eradicated the menace lurking in the mountains.

For dinner, Liu Yun served humble dishes from her garden—simple fare without meat, yet Guan Yu and Wang Jun ate heartily. After coaxing Xiao Yuan to sleep, she emerged and whispered, “Rest here tonight. The outer room should suffice.”

The space was indeed spacious, neatly arranged with bedding. Guan Yu’s thoughts drifted to the plight of a household without a man—how would they sustain themselves? “Liu Yun,” he asked, “how will you and Xiao Yuan manage without income?”

“My husband saved some money,” she replied. “For common folk like us, growing vegetables cuts costs. We only need silver for Xiao Yuan’s New Year clothes. Otherwise, we spend little.”

It was true. Mother and daughter lived frugally, their needs meager. Yet Guan Yu, moved by their kindness, resolved to help. Wang Jun, catching his intent, smirked.

“Take these,” Guan Yu said, placing two gold leaves on the table. Liu Yun stared, wide-eyed—she’d never seen such wealth, only scattered copper coins and scraps of silver.

“This is too much! I can’t accept it!” she protested, trembling.

Wang Jun chuckled. “The rumors about your generosity are true, Guan Yu. Gold leaves as casual gifts?”

“I lack smaller coins,” Guan Yu retorted, though he carried silver. He knew the gold would secure their future. Liu Yun’s refusal wavered as Wang Jun added his own leaf. “Consider it for Xiao Yuan. She’ll need pretty dresses and dolls as she grows.”

After relentless persuasion, Liu Yun finally accepted, hands shaking. Guan Yu suspected she might panic over the sudden fortune, but trusted she’d deposit the gold safely.

As night deepened, they prepared to leave. Liu Yun fretted, “The mountains are dangerous—”

“We’ll be fine,” Wang Jun assured. “But could you find us dark clothes? Our current attire’s too conspicuous.”

She returned with her late husband’s garments. Guan Yu frowned at the morbid thought but dressed anyway. Wang Jun’s petite frame drowned in the fabric until Liu Yun tailored it swiftly, her needle flying.

“Remarkable skill,” Wang Jun praised, now comfortably clad.

They debated riding horses but opted for stealth. “Stay safe,” Liu Yun urged as they departed.

The mountain loomed dark and silent. Soaring above on swords, they found no trace of the rumored half-demons. “Could the threat be a ruse?” Guan Yu mused.

Returning, they overheard raucous laughter from the government office’s courtyard—a stark contrast to the town’s dread. Women’s cries within confirmed their suspicion: the authorities themselves were the villains, masquerading as monsters.

“We’ll return tomorrow as ‘distinguished guests,’” Guan Yu plotted. “Expose their charade.”

Back at Liu Yun’s, they withheld their discovery. She waited anxiously, relief flooding her when they returned unharmed.

Dawn broke with Guan Yu sleeping till noon, roused by Xiao Yuan’s giggles. Over another meal, he contemplated infiltrating the office. Their current clothes wouldn’t do—they needed disguises.

The game was afoot.
