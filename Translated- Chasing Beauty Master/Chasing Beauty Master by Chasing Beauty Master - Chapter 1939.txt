“Actually, Aunt Right Envoy, you don’t know this, but there has always been a seal in my mind. This seal is like a bomb that could explode at any moment.” Guan Yu continued, “It has devoured some of my abilities and fragments of my past memories. I’ve tried countless methods to unravel it, but none worked. In my homeland, there’s a legend that obtaining a World Sovereign’s Relic could break such a seal. So I searched everywhere and eventually came here.

Upon arriving, I found only cultivators—no talk of World Sovereigns at their peak, let alone such relics. But when I obtained the first volume of the Eight-Sided Drum technique, I discovered it could slightly loosen the seal in my mind.

However, one volume alone wasn’t enough to contend with the seal. That’s why I concluded that gathering all four volumes might finally break it. That’s what I’ve pursued until now.”

The Right Envoy hadn’t expected such a tale. She didn’t know the nature of the seal in Guan Yu’s mind. If it were a minor issue, she might have helped, but given its severity, she doubted her ability to intervene.

Recalling events, she said, “The first volume of the Eight-Sided Drum technique was obtained from Meng Hua the Ancestor’s underground palace near Qujiang City, right? You used the Skyburner Path to open the palace gates and claimed it.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Exactly. Wang Xiaorong’s assistance was crucial then. Without her, the Demon Lord might have discovered us. At the time, escaping his grasp would’ve been impossible.”

**Chapter 5095: Inquiries**

“I also heard Xuan Ming demanded the technique, but you claimed it wasn’t on you. He likely investigated but failed to realize you’d transferred the first volume to the Emperor’s Seal. Clever move—deceiving both the Demon Lord and Xuan Ming, two sect leaders!” The Right Envoy chuckled wryly.

“I had no choice. Once I realized the technique might unlock my seal, I resolved to protect it at all costs,” Guan Yu replied.

“Fate favored you,” the Right Envoy remarked. “Had you not obtained the Emperor’s Seal from Xuan Ming—a tool capable of storing the technique—you’d never have succeeded. Who’d expect an auxiliary artifact to harbor such power? Even I wouldn’t have believed it without your word.”

She fixed him with a gaze. “So you now possess three volumes? The East Sea holds the last? Earlier, you lied to me, claiming the technique hadn’t surfaced—a false rumor.”

Caught, Guan Yu smiled sheepishly. “Yes, I have three volumes. Forgive the deception, Aunt Right Envoy. Necessity compelled me.”

“I understand. Were I in your place, I’d have done the same, especially among those I distrusted. Xuan Ming’s trust in you is evident—he never detected the techniques you carried. A testament to your skill.”

“You flatter me,” Guan Yu demurred. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi giggled, recognizing the backhanded compliment.

“You fooled even me until this moment,” the Right Envoy admitted. “What truly happened in the demon realm’s underground chamber? Why was there no trace of the technique’s awakening?”

Guan Yu explained, “The Eight-Sided Drum technique isn’t some fabricated tale. Meng Hua the Ancestor had no reason to create decoys. Each volume’s emergence hints at the next. Without one, clues for the subsequent volume wouldn’t appear.”

“True,” the Right Envoy mused. “But when that old猩猩 blocked us in the demon realm, I killed him in haste. If the technique had already manifested in the chamber, why did we sense nothing?”

“The Emperor’s Seal masked it. Upon finding the second volume, I activated the seal to draw both volumes inward. The commotion occurred within the artifact—a radiant spectacle like caged beasts unleashed—while outwardly, all seemed calm.”

“Ah! The Emperor’s Seal shielded you. After centuries dormant, it’s become your talisman. When we entered later, only ashes and floating clues remained. I believed your claim of finding nothing—how naive!”

“I couldn’t risk revealing the truth. Even now, I share this only due to Xiaorong’s concern. The technique’s importance is paramount,” Guan Yu said.

“Why did that猩猩 bar us yet let you enter first? Had we reached the chamber sooner, I might’ve discovered the technique,” the Right Envoy pressed.

Guan Yu replied, “I outpaced you, sealed the entrance after defeating him. As the first human to conquer him—his so-called ‘fated one’—I gained access. You who followed were mere trespassers.”

Hearing this, the Right Envoy sighed. “You’ve duped me for so long! I later battled Crimson Lotus Sect elders, wasting spiritual energy. Had I known you’d secured the technique, I’d have spared the effort.”

“Circumstances forced my silence. I beg your understanding—and discretion. No one else must learn of this.”

“My loyalty lies with the Demon Lord, but your secret dies with me. Even if he questions me later, I’ll plead ignorance. That is my principle.”

**Chapter 5096: Unveiling Truths**

“Thank you, Aunt Right Envoy. I trust you and Xiaorong implicitly. Others would extract this secret only over my corpse. Its exposure would pit not just the Demon Lord against me—every power-hungry faction would hunt me. Xuan Ming himself would unleash Yunqing Sect’s Hidden Dragon Sword.”

The scenario was dire. Possessing three volumes, Guan Yu’s life would become endless peril if the truth spread.

“Rest assured, Aunt Right Envoy would never betray you,” Wang Xiaorong vowed. “Since childhood, she’s concealed my misdeeds from Father. Her silence is unbreakable.”

Guan Yu nodded gravely. “I spoke only because I trusted you utterly.”

“I respect your integrity, Guan Yu. Were your circumstances different, Xiaorong could choose no better. I bless your union.”

Changing tack, the Right Envoy asked, “How did you secure the third volume in the Forbidden City, evading even the Left Envoy? His wit surpasses mine.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “By chance, the Emperor summoned Guan Yu to the palace. In the Golden Hall, we found a colossal white gem engraved with ‘Longevity Rivaling Heaven’—the characters flowed like symbols matching the Eight-Sided Drum script.

One night, we infiltrated the hall. The gem exploded into snowy powder, revealing the third volume’s golden radiance. Guan Yu stored it in the Emperor’s Seal. As we fled, I noticed characters formed by falling powder—clues to the final volume!”

“Of course you aided his deception,” the Right Envoy sighed. “The Left Envoy arrived late, finding nothing amiss.”

Qiqi added, “Their tardiness blinded them.”

Gazing outward, the Right Envoy murmured, “‘Boundless seas, valley of horizons, dragon pearl’s treasure, divine skill pervades the city’—the final volume’s clue, known only to you. Yet its convergence with the East Sea treasure will draw multitudes. Claiming it undetected will prove arduous.”

“I’ve no choice,” Guan Yu declared. “After investing so much, retreat is unthinkable. Even facing Xuan Ming’s Hidden Dragon Sword, I’ll stand firm.”

Wang Xiaorong speculated, “Treasure may distract the crowds. Guan Yu could seize the technique unnoticed.”

Qiqi countered, “Only the strongest faction will reach the treasure’s heart. Bloodshed will thin their ranks beforehand.”

Guan Yu agreed. “Factions like Yunqing Sect and Demon Soul Sect will clash on sight. We’ll avoid conflicts, focus solely on our goal.”

He added, “The East Sea treasure’s existence remains mythical. Yet the Eight-Sided Drum technique is treasure enough for me. Even past holders of the East Sea Dragon Pearl failed to find it—this won’t be easy.”

**Chapter 5097: Leaked Secrets**

The Right Envoy questioned, “Why travel so conspicuously? The entire Jianghu buzzes with your movements.”

Guan Yu frowned. “We never intended this. By the time we noticed, rumors had spread. What intel do you have?”

Initially, discussions with Duan Ruxue occurred privately at her home, attended only by her father. Later, Jiang Yuankai’s involvement at Wan Yang Tavern might have leaked plans—or perhaps followers tracking Jiang Yuankai, bearer of the East Sea Dragon Pearl, deduced their purpose.

The Right Envoy explained, “Our spies reported everything. Once the Dragon Pearl surfaced, the Demon Soul Sect monitored Jiang Yuankai. His meeting with Duan Ruxue at Wan Yang Tavern and subsequent journey here signaled treasure hunting to all.”

“But how did others learn the Duan family knows the East Sea’s location?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Unknown. The Demon Lord knew our Young Master accompanied you. Though concerned for her safety, he trusted your protection. Our agents now shadow you, gathering intel and safeguarding her amidst rising tensions.”
