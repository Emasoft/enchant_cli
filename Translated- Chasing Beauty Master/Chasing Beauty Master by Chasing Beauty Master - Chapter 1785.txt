The next morning, just as dawn's crimson hues tinted eastern skies, Xiao Mei sent someone to rouse Guan Yu. Rubbing sleep from his eyes as he stepped outside, Guan Yu observed the auspicious red glow with mixed feelings - while promising fair weather, it foretold another scorching day in this infernal desert.

Guan Yu yearned to soar from this sandy prison immediately. With their party well-rested and no lingering threats, every moment here felt wasted. "Why wake me at this ungodly hour?" he grumbled, irritation coloring his voice. "What's so urgent?"

Xiao Mei hadn't slept a wink, her mind racing with visions of Jianghu adventures and the imminent migration of her entire Heterodox Sect. Excitement thrummed through her veins like live wires. "Aren't you departing today?" she chirped, false cheer ringing hollow. "I've prepared provisions. Best gather your things quickly."

Guan Yu recognized her poorly-concealed eagerness to be rid of them. Suppressing a sigh, he acquiesced. "Forget camels. Prepare dry rations and water for all. We'll use flight techniques - should exit this hellscape within a day." His tone brooked no argument as he turned away.

When the group assembled, Wang Jun eyed Xiao Mei curiously. "Any unfinished business here?" he asked Guan Yu.

"None. We return directly to Yunqing Sect." Guan Yu's answer came crisp as autumn air.

"But she seems intent on following."

"She has personal matters in Jianghu. Our paths merely align temporarily." Guan Yu kept explanations sparse with other disciples present.

As they prepared for departure, an oversight became apparent - while Guan Yu could rely on Siqi's flight mastery, Xiao Mei's trio lacked this skill. Guan Yu drew the snake-woman aside. "Only three attendants, I see?"

"Yes, but..." Panic tinged her voice. "We can't fly! You promised-"

"My word holds." Guan Yu produced silver ingots. "Offer these to any disciple willing to carry you. Our brothers aren't immune to worldly temptations."

Xiao Mei dubiously brandished the silver. "Who'll bear me? Generous payment awaits!"

Guan Yu played along: "Were my flight skills better, I'd claim this prize myself!"

Though tempted, disciples hesitated. A'ze finally stepped forward. "I'll carry you," the timid disciple offered. "Silver or not, friends help friends."

Thus their aerial caravan launched skyward. The desert teemed with returning travelers, all too weary for conflict. By next dawn, Camel Town's silhouette blessed their vision - and with it, proper beds and hot meals.

Xiao Mei marveled at bustling streets, envisioning her sect's future here. "Better than endless sand, no?" she chirped to Siqi, dragging the reluctant cultivator through market stalls.

As they settled in a crowded tavern, Wang Jun voiced concerns: "What of Lin Chen?"

"Let the traitors bite each other," Guan Yu dismissed, counting silver for inn rooms. His musings broke when Right Envoy of Demon Soul Sect approached.

"Well met, Young Guan." The formidable woman's gaze sharpened on Xiao Mei. "Since when do Yunqing's righteous keep snake demon company?"

Xiao Mei bristled, but Guan Yu restrained her. "Elder Right Envoy mistakes a benefactor for foe. Without Sect Leader Xiao's aid, we'd never have breached Miao City."

The tense exchange dissolved as gongs clamored outside - a martial tournament for some noble's hand. While Guan Yu dismissed it, Xiao Mei's eyes shone with mischief. Before schemes could form, Right Envoy's parting barb hung in the air: "Take care your pets don't bite, Young Hero."

As cultivators dispersed to rest, Guan Yu's thoughts churned - between sect politics, financial burdens, and the unpredictable serpent-girl now entwined in their fate. The real journey, it seemed, was only beginning.
