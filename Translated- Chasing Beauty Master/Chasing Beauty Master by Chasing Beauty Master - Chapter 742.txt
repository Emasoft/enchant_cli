The four sat down to order. Wei Hongwei hadn’t dared utter a word the entire time, visibly nervous, while the girl also seemed shy. Thus, the responsibility of ordering fell entirely to Guan Yu.

After finalizing the dishes, Lü Mei teased, *“What’s gotten into our Wei-ge today? Not a single word. Usually, you’re the chattiest one.”*

Guan Yu interjected helpfully, *“Can’t you tell? Our Wei-ge is just shy. You introduced him to such a stunning girl—how could he not be? Now that half this blind date’s over, Qian Yaoyao, what do you think of our Wei-ge?”*

Qian Yaoyao, appearing more relaxed than Wei Hongwei, smiled. *“Not bad. I don’t care much about looks—as long as he treats me well and respects his parents. Though compatibility takes time to know.”*

*“Exactly,”* Guan Yu nodded. *“Time tells all. What does your family do, Yaoyao?”*

**Chapter 1882: Common Ground**

While Qian Yaoyao’s beauty paled slightly compared to Lü Mei’s rare elegance, she remained undeniably attractive.

Qian Yaoyao replied modestly, *“My family’s ordinary. I have an older brother. My parents own three internet cafés in City A. I study at Zhouyang High.”*

Given the booming café industry—fueled by sixteen-year-olds obtaining IDs and gaming’s popularity—owning three cafés in City A hinted at considerable wealth.

Wei Hongwei perked up at the mention of gaming. *“Does this mean free access to your family’s cafés? Gaming’s better there—home’s too quiet.”*

*“Sure. I’ll upgrade your ID to a VIP pass—no charges,”* Qian Yaoyao offered, her voice melodic.

The two soon bonded over gaming. Guan Yu asked, *“Yaoyao, what does your brother do?”*

*“He’s also at Zhouyang High—Qian Yunqing (Fortune Upholding). We’re twins, a dragon and phoenix pair (brother and sister).”*

*“Your parents are amazing! So lucky!”* Lü Mei praised, placing meat in Guan Yu’s bowl. *“Yunqing’s a cultivation expert. He’ll represent Zhouyang in the city’s taekwondo tournament. You might face him.”*

*“Oh? If we meet, I’ll enjoy sparring with him,”* Guan Yu grinned.

*“Guan-ge, for my sake, go easy on my future brother-in-law!”* Wei Hongwei’s plea sparked laughter. Qian Yaoyao added shyly, *“We’re not officially dating yet. Let’s start as friends.”*

*“Fair,”* Wei Hongwei conceded. Guan Yu cut in, *“But he’s smitten. Wei-ge’s loyal—trust Lü Mei’s judgment. She’d never set you up with a flake.”*

*“True,”* Lü Mei affirmed. *“Wei-ge’s smooth-talking but reliable. No need for doubts.”*

Though initially hesitant, Qian Yaoyao relented under their encouragement and shared gaming passion. After learning Wei Hongwei’s family background—his only flaw being slight chubbiness—she agreed to date him.

*“A toast to the new couple!”* Guan Yu raised his glass.

Now officially together, Wei Hongwei relaxed while Qian Yaoyao grew bashful. *“Wei Hongwei… your current size is my limit. No need to diet, but don’t gain more. Promise?”*

*“Leave it to me,”* Guan Yu vowed. *“I’ll make sure he exercises. He won’t gain an ounce.”*

Wei Hongwei declared, *“Yaoyao, for you, I’ll only slim down!”* Finding a girl as genuine as her felt rare, and he was thrilled.

Wei Hongwei then called for a gift. Soon, a waitress entered with a massive rose bouquet.

*“Our first meeting’s first gift—999 roses. Please accept,”* he said.

Blushing crimson, Qian Yaoyao whispered thanks, embracing the flowers. Women adored roses—their symbolism, their allure.

The lively blind date concluded, marking Wei Hongwei’s farewell to singlehood. He escorted Qian Yaoyao home, while Guan Yu walked Lü Mei to her door.

Noticing the new guard, Guan Yu remarked, *“Huh? Changed guards?”*

Lü Mei pinched him. *“Thanks to you, Brother Zhao’s still hospitalized.”*

*“Good riddance. His arrogance was insufferable.”*

*“He was Uncle Wang’s relative!”*

*“Didn’t care then, don’t now. Arrogance deserves a beating.”*

Lü Mei rolled her eyes. *“I’m home. Want to… come in?”*

*“Not tonight. First visits shouldn’t be this late. I’ll meet your parents another time.”*

She nodded. *“Actually… my dad died over a decade ago. It’s just Mom and me.”*

Shocked, Guan Yu mentally cursed Wei Hongwei for withholding this. *“I… didn’t know. Your mom’s incredible—managing everything alone all these years.”*

Lü Mei suddenly hugged him, voice trembling. *“Meeting you… my greatest luck.”* Guan Yu patted her back. *“I’ll take care of you. Next time, I’ll visit properly.”*

Standing tip-toe, she kissed his lips lightly before darting inside. Guan Yu touched his mouth, smiling faintly.

Later, Wei Hongwei called elatedly. *“Guan-ge! Tomorrow I’ll thank Lü Mei properly for setting me up!”*

*“Listen—update me on everyone connected to me. Don’t wait for questions!”* Guan Yu chided.

*“What’s wrong?”* Wei Hongwei worried.

**Chapter 1883: Not for Any Price**

*“Lü Mei’s dad died years ago! She had to tell me herself! What kind of ‘brother’ are you?!”*

*“You… never asked! I thought you knew!”*

*“Bullshit! Should’ve told me! Want castration?!”*

*“Mercy, Guan-ge! I just got a girlfriend! I’ll improve!”*

*“Fine. Next slip-up, you’ll be China’s last eunuch.”*

Hanging up, Guan Yu found a text from Lü Mei: *“That was my first kiss. Don’t wash your face or brush teeth for 3 days. ESPECIALLY YOUR MOUTH.”*

Chuckling, he replied: *“Three days? I’ll stink!”*

*“Suffer through it!”*

*“Fine.”*

Next morning, A’mei and Xue Jing prepared breakfast.

*“Wash up first,”* Xue Jing called. At the sink, Guan Yu remembered Lü Mei’s order. *“Guess I’ll skip washing. My skin’s good anyway,”* he mused, admiring his reflection.

At school, Lü Mei inspected his face approvingly before kissing him again. *“Reward for obeying.”*

Classmates gasped enviously at the golden couple.

*“Didn’t brush either. Still taste last night’s pizza,”* Guan Yu teased.

*“Gross!”* Lü Mei turned away.

At lunch, Wei Hongwei piled Guan Yu’s plate with delicacies as apology.

*“Hey Guan Yu, name your price for Xue Jing.”* A familiar voice interrupted.

Looking up, Guan Yu saw Wang Jun—Xue Jing’s tomboyish desk mate. Despite masculine attire, her feminine charm shone through.

*“She’s not merchandise. Can’t be sold,”* Guan Yu said coolly.

*“Call me ‘Brother’,”* Wang Jun demanded, sitting boldly. Known for her temper, she silenced even Wei Hongwei.

*“No one alive earns that title from me,”* Guan Yu retorted.

*“Xue Jing and I are meant to be. Step aside.”*

*“Your delusion. What does Xue Jing think?”*

*“She refuses. Hence, I’m here.”*

Xue Jing’s fiery demeanor deterred most suitors—except Wang Jun’s relentless pursuit.

*“Why hide your femininity? Dressed as a woman, you’d have admirers galore,”* Guan Yu remarked.

Wang Jun faltered momentarily before pressing, *“How much?”*

*“Never. Xue Jing’s mine forever.”*

*“So you refuse?”*

*“Precisely.”*

Xue Jing arrived just then, overhearing. *“I’m not for sale. I belong to Guan Yu.”*

Defeated, Wang Jun left, though Guan Yu’s words about her potential lingered.

*“Sit, Sister Xue,”* Wei Hongwei offered. *“We’ve got plenty.”*

*“Wang Jun’s driving me mad,”* Xue Jing sighed. *“Constantly inviting me to hotels!”*

Guan Yu smirked. *“Two women can… entertain themselves.”*

*“What’re you thinking?”* Xue Jing narrowed her eyes.

*“Eat up. At least she’s not bothering me.”*

Chen Tianxiao approached. *“Guan Yu, ready for the tournament? First match’s against Zhouyang’s Qian Yunqing—their ace.”*

Wei Hongwei’s face fell. *“My future brother-in-law? We’re doomed!”*

*“No mercy,”* Guan Yu stated.

**Chapter 1884: Tournament Rules**

*“Eight schools total,”* Chen Tianxiao explained. *“First round: Kaihuang vs. Zhouyang, Qudao vs. Linyuan, Lanzhe vs. Qiliang, Shenghai vs. Shiji Garden. Winners enter semifinals. Losers compete for sixth place. Semifinal winners clash for the championship at Shanhai Beyond—a coastal resort island.”*

*“Each semifinalist brings one companion,”* he added. *“Others can attend independently.”*

Wei Hongwei brightened. *“I’ve been there! Huge island—boats only!”*

Guan Yu nodded. *“Time to prepare.”*
