The contract was quickly drafted, and only then did Guan Yu realize that the thirty-million-yuan company being transferred included merely the storefront, some machinery, registration documents, and qualifications—completed real estate projects were excluded.

A hollow shell! Guan Yu frowned as he reviewed the transfer agreement.

“Paying thirty million for this empty shell of a company? Just give me the cash instead,” Guan Yu proposed quietly.

“Cash? Where would I get cash? Everything’s tied up in these projects! After taking over, you’ll have to collect debts from city officials yourself. This company alone has over ten million yuan in unpaid project deposits! You can figure it out when the documents arrive,” retorted Boss Jiang coldly, lips pressed thin.

Guan Yu had no experience with such matters, but it didn’t sound bad. Was he suddenly a corporate boss? So quickly? Bemused, he chuckled and grinned.

“Another company?” Guan Yu licked his lips, smirking as he raised an eyebrow. “Shall we play for the twenty-million one next?”

Boss Jiang took a deep breath and slapped his thigh. “Let’s play! If you win, it’s yours. If you lose, you owe me twenty million!” he growled through clenched teeth, glaring fiercely.

“I don’t have twenty million. Let’s bet this company against your remaining one,” Guan Yu countered with a wave.

*I can’t lose anyway.* On paper, he’d risked losing ten million, but Guan Yu didn’t care. With guaranteed victory, why overthink?

It began and ended in under ten seconds.

**Chapter 169: Family Ties**

The all-or-nothing gamble concluded abruptly when Guan Yu’s three of spades defeated Boss Jiang’s jack.

Absurd yet poignant. The surrounding bosses sighed resignedly, watching the gold-chain-clad, shirtless Jiang. No one offered comfort—not even the woman he’d brought, who blinked in shock, replaying the loss.

“Don’t worry. I honor my bets. My secretary will deliver the documents shortly. Hah! Consider it bankruptcy. Yes… bankruptcy…” Boss Jiang forced a laugh, self-soothing.

Guan Yu motioned for Niu Le and Luo Cheng to pack the cash into suitcases while calculating silently.

*Leaving with eight suitcases? We’ll be corpses before we walk far.* Though the money was legitimately won, carrying millions in cash safely seemed impossible. Many here had underworld ties—crushing a nobody like him would be effortless.

And Boss Jiang, now bankrupt—would he accept defeat without resentment? A starved camel is still bigger than a horse. The man hadn’t hit rock bottom yet…

Reassessing his predicament, Guan Yu grew uneasy.

“No rush. Settle everything within an hour. I’m in no hurry,” Guan Yu said casually, exiting to call Feng Xin.

Only Feng Xin, the Fire Gang’s leader and his martial sister, could help now. With her influence, this should resolve smoothly.

“How much did you win?” Feng Xin exclaimed when he explained.

“Tens of millions…”

“Are you drunk?” she snapped, suspecting a prank.

“It’s true! Eight million in cash, two companies… Winning too much makes leaving… complicated.”

After verifying his location, Feng Xin hung up, mobilizing her armed crew to rush to Luofu Hotel.

*Has he gone mad? Gambling for millions…* she thought while driving.

Boss Jiang’s secretary soon arrived with transfer contracts and corporate documents. As Guan Yu prepared to sign, the doorbell rang.

“Who’s here now?” Bao Si eyed the secretary suspiciously. *Is she calling the cops to void the debt?*

But it was Feng Xin.

“She’s with me. Let them in,” Guan Yu said.

Upon entering, Feng Xin’s presence awed the room. Boss Jiang brightened instantly.

“Little Xin! What brings you here?”

“Here to collect my younger brother,” she said, patting Guan Yu’s shoulder.

Guan Yu paled, speechless.

“Whose millions did he win?” Feng Xin asked, striding inside.

“Mine…” Boss Jiang muttered.

“Yours?” She whirled to Guan Yu. “You dragged me here to guard money won from my *second brother*?”

Other bosses scattered after brief greetings, sensing tension. Alone, Feng Xin sat and fixed Guan Yu with a stare.

“Why gamble? How’d you win?”

“Luck.”

“Both his companies?”

Guan Yu nodded.

“A gambling prodigy, eh? Let’s bet. My two companies against yours.”

Guan Yu gulped. Feng Xin wouldn’t demand he forfeit the winnings, but since Jiang was her cousin, keeping everything felt wrong.

*But giving up fifty million?* His heart bled at the thought.

“Since we’re family, consider this a game. The bet’s void,” Guan Yu forced out, internally wailing.

**Chapter 170: Car Crash**

As Guan Yu spoke, Du Xiaojuan pinched his waist, pouting.

“Who’s this?” Feng Xin eyed the girl.

“A… school senior,” Guan Yu replied awkwardly, inexplicably guilty.

Feng Xin’s smile chilled the room.

“Second Brother, transfer the companies. We can’t swindle him,” she said.

“No! Keep them!” Guan Yu insisted, prioritizing his martial arts mentor over money.

“Fine. Give him profit shares instead,” Feng Xin decided. Grateful, Boss Jiang agreed.

The matter closed with Guan Yu keeping eight million cash and a car.

“Deposit the money before banks close,” Feng Xin said outside, eyeing Du Xiaojuan before leaving.

“Who’s *she*?” Du Xiaojuan glared at Feng Xin’s retreating figure.

“My martial sister,” Guan Yu explained, driving to the bank.

Niu Le and Luo Cheng marveled at the cash. “We’re rich! And a car!”

But Guan Yu felt empty. *Feng Xin, Du Xiaojuan, Liu Shilei—who do I choose?*

After depositing the money, Guan Yu split cash between his friends. As they headed to celebrate, his phone rang.

“Mr. Guan? Big Sister crashed her car! Come quick!”

**Chapter 171: The Scar**

Feng Xin sat roadside, clutching her bruised leg, her Mercedes crumpled against a bus. “Leave me! Let it hurt!”

Guan Yu arrived, relieved she was alive.

“Why are *you* here? Go tend to your *senior*!” she snapped, eyes glistening.

“You’re hurt! Let me see.”

“Don’t touch me!” She shoved him, wincing.

“I care! You’re my sister!” he said softly, activating his healing skill to ease her pain before carrying her to the hospital.

In the operating room, Feng Xin puzzled over her own feelings. *Why do I mind his other girl? He’s just a fake boyfriend…*

Yet the thought lingered, unresolved.
