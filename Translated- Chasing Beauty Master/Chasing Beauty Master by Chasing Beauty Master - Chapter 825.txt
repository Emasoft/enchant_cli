“You damn bitch, I gave you face, yet you don’t know how to take it!” the bald man roared. “I told you to wait for me in the hotel room, but you made me wait over an hour? Are you fucking treating me like some weekend fool?”

By now, many customers had been frightened, and the timid ones had already fled. The proprietress frowned, eyeing the three men standing at the entrance.

The small restaurant had only opened a few days ago, yet in that short time, the beautiful proprietress’s reputation had already spread. Most patrons were men, drawn by the legend of this “Restaurant Belle.”

The bald man had also come because of her fame. After his meal, he’d offered her 50,000 yuan to meet him at a hotel. But when she failed to show up after an hour, the furious bald man returned with his lackeys to confront her.

Pan Taisheng whispered to Guan Yu, “That bald guy is a notorious thug around here. His boss, Brother Hui, controls these streets and collects protection fees.”

“So he shares the same boss as you?” Guan Yu asked with a chuckle.

“Well… sort of. I used to work under him, but not anymore,” Pan Taisheng replied awkwardly.

Guan Yu showed no sign of tension. Since this was happening right before him, he couldn’t ignore it—especially since the bald man was clearly instigating trouble.

Qing Ling’er grew restless. She hated such confrontations. “Guan Yu,” she urged, “we’ve had enough to drink. Let’s leave.”

“Relax. That bald fool can’t cause much trouble,” Pan Taisheng reassured her. Privately, he thought intervening might win the proprietress’s favor—or even her heart.

The proprietress spoke softly, “We can discuss matters calmly. Why damage my door?” The bald man ignored her attempt at peace, shouting, “Listen, today you’ll—”

Before he could finish, she cut him off. Though his voice boomed, hers carried a magnetic force that silenced him involuntarily.

Coldly, she demanded, “Before you speak, pay for my door and compensate the losses from the fleeing customers.”

Timid patrons had left without settling bills, costing her income.

The bald man scratched his hairless scalp furiously. “Screw your logic! If not for your looks, I’d have smashed this place already!”

“Unreasonable. If you keep causing trouble, I’ll call the police.” As the proprietress invoked the law, Guan Yu shook his head silently, knowing it was futile.

Brother Hui dominated this area. Even authorities avoided meddling in his turf. Businesses paid protection fees for peace, and under his rule, shops often left doors unlocked at night without fear of theft.

Guan Yu recalled a story: a 24-hour supermarket on Brother Hui’s turf was robbed. The thief, attempting to assault the female clerk, was hunted down by Hui’s men, beaten half-dead before being handed to police. Since then, no one dared cause trouble here.

Pan Taisheng’s apartment also paid fees to Hui. It was preferable to taxes—at least Hui ensured real protection. Yet today, the drunken bald man defied this order. Guan Yu guessed the proprietress, being new and non-local, hadn’t paid the fees yet.

The bald man’s return suggested he’d confirmed her non-payment. Smashing the door was his opening move.

“Listen, whore!” he threatened. “Come with me now, and I’ll treat you right. Refuse, and I’ll wreck this dump! Operating on Hui’s turf without paying? You’re asking for it!”

Guan Yu whispered to Pan Taisheng, who nodded and stood. “Hey, Baldy! Bullying a woman? That’s your style?”

“Pan? Stay out of this!” the bald man snapped, though warily. Pan had once been Hui’s right-hand man.

“Cool down,” Pan said, twirling a toothpick. “She’s my sister. We’ll pay Hui tomorrow.” He winked at the proprietress, urging her to play along.

She understood but refused. “Thank you, sir, but I’ll handle this myself.”

Pan cursed inwardly. Guan Yu noted her stubbornness intrigued Pan.

“See, Pan?” the bald man jeered. “She doesn’t want your help. Scram!”

Pan retreated, embarrassed. The proprietress bowed slightly in thanks before turning back. “I don’t care who you work for. My shop is new, and this has nothing to do with protection fees—you’re just causing trouble. Is this how your boss teaches you to act?”

Her sharp tone stunned everyone. Guan Yu had sensed her strength earlier. In this dog-eat-dog world, her defiance was rare—and dangerous.

The bald man laughed. “Feisty! I like that! Boys, tie her up!”

As a lackey lunged with rope, the proprietress grabbed a steaming dish and hurled it. The thug screamed, face scalded.

“Touch me, and I’ll die fighting!” she declared.

Patrons cheered. The crowd’s momentum might have overwhelmed the thugs, but fear of Brother Hui held them back.

“Shut up!” the bald man bellowed. “Defy Hui, and you’ll regret it!” The crowd quieted.

When another lackey hesitated, the bald man kicked him forward. The man stumbled, but the proprietress sidestepped gracefully. A patron smashed a plate on his head, leaving him dazed.

Guan Yu watched closely. Her movements suggested martial training, yet he sensed no inner energy. Mysterious.

**Chapter 3014: A Fiery Disposition**

The bald man, enraged, ordered his remaining lackey: “Grab her!”

The man approached cautiously. The proprietress feinted grabbing another dish, making him flinch.

“Hesitate again, and I’ll skin you!” the bald man roared, kicking his subordinate toward her.

She dodged, and as the man fell, someone—likely her—slammed a plate on his skull. Shards flew. The thug collapsed, groaning.

Guan Yu marveled: *She’s ruthless. But where’s her martial power?* Her defiance blazed like a pepper-spiced tigress—a deadly combination.
