When Guan Yu charged toward Xue Jing, what he held in his hand could generously be called a branch, but in reality, it was little more than a crude tree limb. The two-finger-thick stick waved through the air, its tip adorned with a tangle of leaves and smaller branches, extending over two meters in total length.

No one knew when Guan Yu had procured this makeshift weapon. As the saying goes, “A longer reach grants greater strength.” With such an advantage, holding out for two minutes against Xue Jing seemed entirely plausible.

The crowd watched Guan Yu with disdain. Zhang Han openly scoffed, “Look at this! Sister Jing is unarmed, yet Guan Yu wields that monstrosity. This is blatant cheating.”

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the onlookers. Only Lin Qiaoqiao gazed at Guan Yu with admiration, silently praising his cleverness.

As Guan Yu closed in, he brandished the branch with fluid motions reminiscent of Tai Chi staff techniques, aiming to prolong the skirmish. He retreated whenever Xue Jing advanced, intent solely on surviving the allotted time.

Seconds ticked by swiftly. Half a minute had already passed in their exchange, with Guan Yu maintaining control through evasive footwork. Xue Jing recognized the futility of prolonging this dance—though Guan Yu’s forms were elegant, they lacked the vital undercurrent of internal energy.

In a blur of motion too swift for the eye to follow, Xue Jing’s steel dagger flashed into her hand. With surgical precision, she began stripping the branch of its foliage and smaller limbs.

Another thirty seconds vanished. Guan Yu’s once-luxuriant weapon now stood bare, reduced to a meter-long stick. The tangled mass of leaves and twigs lay scattered on the ground, severed by Xue Jing’s relentless blade.

Undeterred, Xue Jing pressed her assault. Even if it meant injuring Guan Yu, she resolved to prevent his reckless outing with Lin Qiaoqiao. A convalescing wound, she reasoned, posed less danger than his unchecked impulsiveness.

Abandoning his dwindling staff, Guan Yu shifted tactics. Though Xue Jing had dismissed his earlier maneuvers as mere flourishes, she couldn’t deny the technical mastery behind them—a foundation so solid that only her enhanced speed, fueled by internal energy, had allowed her to dismantle his defense.

As Xue Jing sheathed her dagger for a lightning-fast punch aimed at Guan Yu’s shoulder, Lin Qiaoqiao’s voice rang out: “Time’s up!”

The words struck Xue Jing like thunder. She froze mid-strike, disbelief coloring her tone: “Impossible! My count shows time remaining!” In a flash, she appeared beside Lin Qiaoqiao, snatching the phone to check its timer—2:01.

“Two minutes already?” Xue Jing frowned. “My calculations differed by ten seconds.” Though she’d meticulously tracked the duel’s duration, the device’s impartial numbers left no room for argument.

“Would I tamper with a simple stopwatch?” Lin Qiaoqiao retorted, gesturing at the basic interface. “Start and pause—that’s all there is!”

Guan Yu approached, studying the screen. “Fortune favored me today. Your delayed strike proved costly.” Privately, he too questioned the timing—his mental count had similarly anticipated extra seconds. Only Lin Qiaoqiao knew the truth: she’d started her timer earlier, during Guan Yu’s weapon reveal.

**Chapter 3004: An Improper Match**

Though suspicion lingered, Xue Jing accepted defeat with characteristic dignity. “A wager is a wager,” she conceded, her icy composure unbroken.

Back in the living room, Xue Jing laid out conditions: “You may accompany Qiaoqiao, but only with Second Only to Wolf providing covert protection.” Her assessment of Guan Yu’s current capabilities—technical skill without internal energy—demanded such precautions.

Guan Yu glanced at Yingzi, who nodded eagerly: “I’ll ensure my brother arrives within the hour.” With Second Only to Wolf’s vigilance and Guan Yu’s concealed firearm, Xue Jing reluctantly approved the excursion.

Lin Qiaoqiao bubbled with excitement: “Come tomorrow! The martial arts tournament isn’t local—we’ll need to travel south to my ancestral homeland.”

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed. “Your ethnic minority roots?” He recalled stories of isolated martial arts clans preserving ancient traditions, largely untouched by modern technology.

“Exactly! Most relatives remain there. You’ll pose as my beau to dissuade Father from hosting this tournament. Should he insist, you’ll defeat all challengers.”

“And if victorious?” Guan Yu pressed. “Would your father demand marriage?”

Lin Qiaoqiao feigned nonchalance: “We’ll claim we need time to court properly. A future ‘breakup’ can be arranged.” Her hidden agenda—to entangle Guan Yu romantically—remained unspoken but transparent to Xue Jing.

Though aware of Lin Qiaoqiao’s designs, Xue Jing withheld comment. The southern location posed minimal security risks, and Second Only to Wolf’s presence offered sufficient safeguard.

**Chapter 3005: Emotional Equilibrium**

Dawn’s first light found Guan Yu blearily answering his phone. “Rise and shine, lazybones!” Lin Qiaoqiao’s voice chirped. “The sun’s scorching your bed!”

A glance at his clock—5:47 AM—drew a groan. “I’m up,” he grumbled, knowing protest was futile.

Xue Jing inspected his pistol before departure, her concern thinly veiled: “Stay vigilant.” Behind them, Second Only to Wolf’s black BMW lurked—Yingzi’s insurance against her “future husband’s” peril.

Meanwhile, Bill Lin reignited dealings with the malodorous Elder Xie, offering twenty million for treasure maps through intermediaries. The Yang Family’s auction house complicated matters, matching bids and forcing Bill Lin into uneasy negotiations.

“This smells like a trap,” Bill Lin fretted, recalling Elder Xie’s putrid stench that lingered for days. Yet advisors urged diplomacy: “The Yangs observe ancient codes. No harm will befall an emissary.”

As Guan Yu waited outside Lin Qiaoqiao’s apartment—an hour beyond the promised “moment”—he pondered the fiery beauty’s dual nature: a hurricane of martial prowess harboring fragile hopes. Her calculated delay in descending revealed more than familial tidiness—it betrayed the tremulous excitement of a girl orchestrating proximity to her heart’s desire.

When Lin Qiaoqiao finally appeared, radiant and unapologetic, Guan Yu recognized the truth: this tempest in human form reserved her softness solely for him. Their dynamic balanced on a razor’s edge—Xue Jing’s unspoken feelings necessitating discretion, yet Lin Qiaoqiao’s boldness refused to be ignored.

In her ancestral south, traditions older than modernity would test more than martial prowess. For Guan Yu, the greater challenge lay in navigating the battlefield of hearts—where Lin Qiaoqiao’s stratagems proved far more intricate than any staff technique.
