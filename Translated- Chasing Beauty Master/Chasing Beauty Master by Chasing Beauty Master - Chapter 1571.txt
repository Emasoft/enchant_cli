“This is solid mercury. I must warn you first, this substance is toxic. Prolonged direct contact with the skin will cause heavy metal poisoning.” No sooner had Guan Yu finished speaking than Xiao Qi threw the crossbow bolt to the ground in alarm.

“Hahaha, Guan Yu, what exactly is this thing? Let me see it! How can such a small object pack such tremendous force?” Xiao Qi asked with an ingratiating smile, eyeing the item in Guan Yu’s hand.

Guan Yu pursed his lips, stood up, and walked over to retrieve the fallen bolt. He placed it back into the leather pouch originally crafted from beast hide and stored it along with the hand crossbow.

“Guan Yu, what’s the meaning of this? How utterly unscrupulous!” Xiao Qi exclaimed, visibly displeased. “I’ve just realized how unreliable you are—completely devoid of camaraderie! I’m cutting ties with you!”

Guan Yu replied with deliberate nonchalance, “Ah, I came here earnestly to learn the art of disguise, only to find obstacles at every turn. If others show no consideration, you can’t blame me for reciprocating.”

These words were clearly meant for Xiao Qi. Earlier, Santou had warned the boy that the disguise technique was a unique spell of their Wolf Clan, rarely shared with outsiders. Though Xiao Qi, being young, didn’t regard the matter as gravely as his elders, he still wouldn’t casually divulge the secret.

Impressed by Guan Yu’s character and knowing his friendship with Santou, Xiao Qi had considered teaching him regardless. Yet the mischievous child, ever eager for amusement, had insisted on being addressed as “master” before agreeing.

Now, hearing Guan Yu’s retort, Xiao Qi’s curiosity burned fiercely. He desperately wanted to know what mysterious object could penetrate hardwood so deeply.

“I’ll teach you the disguise technique now!” Xiao Qi blurted urgently. “But first, swear that after I give you the incantation, you’ll show me that device. Only then will I instruct you!” The boy practically bounced with impatience.

Guan Yu stifled a laugh. Children were so easily manipulated. “Very well,” he agreed. “Recite the incantation first. If it proves effective, I might even gift you one of these devices later.”

“Truly? Splendid! No going back on your word!” Xiao Qi scurried to a small table by the bed where inkstone and brush lay. Seizing a sheet of paper, he began scribbling.

Moments later, he handed Guan Yu the paper. “This contains the advanced incantation for the disguise art. Many parts remain unclear to me, so I’ve left no annotations. You’ll have to decipher them yourself.”

**Chapter 4074: No Tricks**

Guan Yu skimmed the text, confident in its authenticity. Xiao Qi, still a child, lacked the cunning for deception. Moreover, as friends, there was no motive for harm. Falsified cultivation methods risked severe physical repercussions—dangers the boy surely wouldn’t court.

As Guan Yu prepared to study the text, Xiao Qi interjected, “You’ve got the incantation! Now show me the device! No tricks!”

“Of course,” Guan Yu chuckled, tucking away the paper. He produced the hand crossbow. “This is called a hand arbalest—an enhanced version of the bow. No ordinary arrow matches its power. Examine it.”

Xiao Qi marveled at the intricate mechanism. “It seems simple at first glance, yet grows more complex upon inspection. What’s this lower component for?”

“This trigger releases the bolt.” Guan Yu demonstrated the empty crossbow’s action. The firing mechanism clicked smoothly.

“Marvelous!” Xiao Qi exclaimed. “Could you make me one?”

“Certainly,” Guan Yu agreed without hesitation. “But crafting requires time. I possess a larger version at home. I’ll gift it when next we meet.”

Xiao Qi’s face fell. “I’d prefer this smaller one now!”

“This one’s for self-defense during dangerous missions,” Guan Yu explained tactfully. “Without it, I’d be vulnerable.”

Though disappointed, Xiao Qi relented. “Very well. But remember—bring the larger one without fail!”

Their negotiations concluded near midnight. Xiao Qi arranged quarters for Guan Yu, who slept soundly till dawn. If all proceeded smoothly, Wang Xiaorong would arrive by nightfall.

**Chapter 4075: Restlessness**

Wang Xiaorong awoke early, her days spent anxiously awaiting news of Guan Yu. As usual, initial inquiries yielded nothing—until Left Envoy approached with electrifying tidings.

“A message arrived from Liuliuzhen: ‘The crossbow awaits you here. Come swiftly.’ Could this be from Guan Yu?”

“The crossbow awaits...” Wang Xiaorong’s spirit ignited. “None but Guan Yu would reference that device! I must go!”

Left Envoy smiled. “The Demon Lord consents, provided I accompany you to confirm his presence.”

Ecstatic, Wang Xiaorong raced to prepare—not forgetting meticulous grooming for this long-awaited reunion.

The Demon Lord’s acquiescence stemmed from pragmatism. With his impending seclusion to heal wounds sustained during the Red Lotus Sect’s万象盘 theft, containing his daughter’s wanderlust proved impossible. Better she seek protection under Guan Yu’s capable guardianship.

**Chapter 4076: Indifference**

Seasonal tensions simmered as rival sects exploited the Demon Lord’s annual retreat. This year, however, his preparations included discreet sentinels to safeguard his daughter. Though resentful of Guan Yu’s affiliation with righteous sects, the Demon Lord acknowledged the youth’s prowess—a shield even Red Lotus assassins might struggle to pierce.

Meanwhile, at Haler City’s inn, Prince Zou fretted over assembling sufficient escorts. “Send word—hire every sellsword willing to guard our caravan. Spare no expense.”

Advisor Xiao Zhi cautioned delay, but the prince knew their fragile peace teetered on collapse. By tomorrow’s dawn, their company must depart—storm or no storm.

As Wang Xiaorong’s carriage raced toward Liuliuzhen, Guan Yu surveyed the inn’s courtyard. A familiar winged messenger caught his eye—the very courier dispatched yesterday.

“Returned already? Any complications?”

“None, sir. The message reached Demon Soul Sect by dawn.”

Guan Yu nodded approval. All threads converged—soon, the board would be set. Let challengers come. Between his crossbow’s precision and Xiaorong’s impending arrival, he stood ready.

Somewhere en route, Wang Xiaorong adjusted her hairpin for the tenth time, oblivious to her father’s hidden guardians shadowing the carriage. Let the world scheme—her universe now held but one fixed star.
