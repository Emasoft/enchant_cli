Yang Conghan (Frost Willow) shook her head. “Never heard of it. There are so many people in the organization, and I’m just a nominal member. I hardly interact with them at all.”

“Are all members of your organization ability cultivators?”

“Yes, at least everyone I know or have heard of. But there are no real experts. Our Free Wanderers branch is small—true masters go to the headquarters. If you want to join, I can introduce you.” Yang Conghan smiled.

Guanyu thought, *I’d rather not.* Jiang Fenju had mentioned last night that ability-user organizations were rare across China, yet two had already surfaced. If neither was behind Zhang Han’s kidnapping, investigating the remaining groups might expose the mastermind.

He considered asking Yang about major missions in her organization but dismissed the idea. Since she had little contact with her branch and operated on a small scale, they’d never be privy to high-stakes operations like kidnapping Zhang Han.

After breakfast, the group prepared to head to Shanhai Stadium. But as they exited the hotel, two police cars sped toward them. Guanyu tensed, unsure what was happening.

Five officers emerged, followed by a young man Guanyu recognized—the student from LanZhe Academy they’d encountered at the restaurant yesterday. “That’s her!” The youth pointed accusingly at Zhang Han.

A portly officer with a face resembling a gorilla’s lumbered forward. “You’re suspected of causing severe bodily harm. Come with us for questioning.”

Zhang Han’s cheeks bulged with snacks as Guanyu stepped in. “We were all present. The victim attempted to assault my friend. She acted in self-defense.”

“Is that true?” The officer smirked, turning to the LanZhe student.

“Lies! My friend merely approached her, and she kicked him so hard he needed surgery!” The youth lied without blinking.

“Grave indeed!” The officer feigned shock. “First-degree disability carries heavy penalties.”

Guanyu saw through the collusion—this timed arrest aimed to disqualify Zhang Han from the championship match. As the officer moved to handcuff her, Xue Jing intervened. “Guanyu, go ahead to the stadium. I’ll handle this.”

Before Guanyu could agree, the officer barked, “She stays! Everyone else can leave.”

Zhang Han spat crumbs. “You toad-faced oaf! Think you can take me that easily?”

Guanyu’s lips twitched—her insults lacked creativity. Xue Jing demanded the officers’ precinct, but the gorilla-faced cop sneered, “None of your business, civilian.”

*Some rich brat who bought his badge,* Guanyu surmised. Losing patience, he kicked the officer sprawling. The man howled as Guanyu thrust a phone at him. “Answer. Now.”

The cop’s bluster vanished when the police chief himself roared through the speaker. After groveling apologies, the chastened officer let them pass. Guanyu warned the LanZhe conspirator: “Pray we don’t face each other in the arena.”

At the packed stadium, LanZhe’s first combatant turned out to be a Western woman—Marlager Peter—wearing impractical stilettos. Wang Hu (Tiger) faced her, his signature energy shield rising to crowd groans.

Marlager kicked off her heels, executing a split that drew whistles. Her aerial kick shattered Wang’s shield instantly, confirming Guanyu’s fears—this foreign ringer outclassed them completely.
