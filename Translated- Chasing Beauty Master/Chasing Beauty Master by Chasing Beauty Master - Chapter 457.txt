“Certainly, but preparation time is required.” Wang Xiaojun did not hesitate. At this life-or-death juncture, personal grudges were set aside - their goals temporarily aligned. Survival came first. Only by living could there be a future. This inheritance ground proved perilous indeed, and they hadn't even breached the inner sanctum yet. What awaited within would surely be deadlier at every step?

"Everyone halt! Give Brother Wang time to prepare." Guan Yu took a deep breath and unleashed his gravity domain. The surrounding ground instantly sank as mist beasts froze in place. Others fought desperately, determined not to let a single creature pass.

"Pure Yang Heavenly Seal! Celestial Net Formation, arise..." Within a minute, golden light flashed in Wang Xiaojun's hands. A golden net emerged from the disc, enveloping all nine members. Mist beasts collided with the barrier, rebounding helplessly against its impenetrable defense.

"Prepare yourselves. One... two... three... CHARGE!" The golden net shuddered under continuous impacts as Wang Xiaojun's complexion paled. With collective resolve, they surged forward.

*Thud!*

Passing through a membrane-like barrier, they emerged from the thick mist. Gasping for air, the group immediately sat cross-legged, consuming elixirs to replenish spiritual energy. Though brief, the skirmish had drained them severely. Fortunately, no injuries were sustained.

Moments later, two bedraggled groups emerged - Qingtian's faction and Lü Wu's contingent. Last came a man strolling leisurely as if taking a morning walk. His fair complexion and delicate features held an androgynous allure - beauty that would shame most women, yet pitiable in male form.

"Ren Qiansha of the Divine Path Sect greets fellow cultivators." The man's charming smile held mesmerizing grace. After brief introductions, he stood fanning himself with elegant poise.

"Since fate brought us here, I'll be brief," Guan Yu sighed. "After activating the inheritance ground, we'll each follow our destinies. Stay vigilant - I commence the ritual now." Though reluctant to permit demonic sect members entry, he recognized the necessity. Excluding them risked destroying this opportunity for all.

Shared interests forged temporary alliances. Guan Yu's authority now stood absolute - whether from righteous or demonic factions, none dared oppose him.

As Guan Yu raised the black rod, demonic cultivators blanched. Their demonic arts trembled under the artifact's suppression - this weapon was clearly forged to counter their kind.

"Heaven and Earth, Primal Chaos! By the name of Demon Subjugation, I unseal this sacred ground. DECREE…"

The incantation carved on the rod materialized in midair, absorbing spiritual energy as it expanded. Characters coalesced into a massive dao character glowing with violet radiance. After dazzling displays of light, a small portal emerged, its purple halo exerting an irresistible gravitational pull.

"Who dares enter first? I can't sustain this long." Guan Yu's ashen face betrayed his exhaustion. Though brief, the chant had drained him completely.

"Claiming first advantage requires risking life. I'll go." Yin Ye's eyes glinted darkly as he vanished into the portal. Others followed reluctantly. Guan Yu inhaled deeply before approaching with the black rod.

"This shall be my pivotal moment," he murmured. Though forgoing the first entry might lose some advantage, he suspected the order mattered little. True inheritance grounds test individuals through tailored trials - opportunities determined by destiny, perseverance, and character rather than mere sequence.

Violet light engulfed him, transporting Guan Yu to an empty plaza enclosed by towering walls. Carved murals depicted techniques alongside an inscription: "Comprehend the supreme art to depart."

"Interesting. Universal rewards then?" Guan Yu chuckled, immersing himself in the ancient knowledge. These priceless techniques far surpassed anything obtainable externally.

Guan Yu's breath hitched - the dense spiritual energy confirmed this wasn't Earth. The peculiar floor stones even blocked spiritual sense. "A test chamber then," he realized, sitting cross-legged. Even Golden Core cultivators couldn't survive indefinitely here without sustenance.

The black rod trembled suddenly, releasing a luminous orb that entered Guan Yu's brow.

"Darkness? My consciousness sea?" Guan Yu steadied himself against primordial fears of possession. From the void emerged a three-foot-tall bald figure scrutinizing him.

"Greetings, Master. I am Jingang, spirit of the Demon Subduing Rod. The sect leader separated me from my immortal artifact form during the cataclysm to await your arrival." Though addressing Guan Yu as master, the spirit circled him appraisingly.

"Cease staring." Guan Yu willed the mental realm to shift, dangling the struggling spirit upside-down. "Explain this inheritance ground thoroughly."

After negotiations, Jingang revealed: "Others remain trapped in illusion arrays. Without this rod, none can claim the true inheritance - especially those demonic fools! The trial demands comprehension. Ancient cultivation prioritized enlightenment above all - talent and temperament being nurtureable, but wisdom springs from innate understanding."

The walls displayed four disciplines: fist, sword, movement, and staff techniques. Choosing fist arts first, Guan Yu absorbed the "Heavenly Gang Tiger Subduing Fist" through thirty-six holographic demonstrations. His replication ability flawlessly mimicked the forms - crude at first, then achieving mastery within four repetitions.

"Master possesses heavenly endowments!" Jingang exclaimed, recognizing Guan Yu's unique gift. "In antiquity, such innate talents belonged only to paramount existences!"

"Call it a 'superpower'," Guan Yu smirked. "Now advise me - complete mastery before challenging the trial?"

"Indeed. Full comprehension yields extra rewards." The spirit vanished, leaving Guan Yu to contemplate fist intent - the killing essence of the white tiger. Through closed eyes, he visualized the final threshold between technique and true embodiment.
