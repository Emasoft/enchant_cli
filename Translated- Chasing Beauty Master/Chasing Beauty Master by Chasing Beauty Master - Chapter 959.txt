Wang Jie fumbled nervously, “Qiaoqiao, your father and I only have your best interests at heart! That young master from the Fang family—”

“—is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime catch who can’t be found even with a lantern,’ right? I knew you’d say that! You’re just obsessed with their money. Well, Guan Yu’s rich too! Why don’t you ask him instead?” Lin Qiaoqiao interrupted sharply.

Guan Yu finally grasped the situation—playing the fake boyfriend was trickier than expected. Tonight’s act needed to be convincing enough to make the old couple accept this “son-in-law.”

Wang Jie’s eyes lit up. If Guan Yu truly came from wealth, and given his tall, handsome appearance… “Guan Yu, come sit! You must be hungry. Let’s eat—this whole table’s gone cold waiting!” she urged, gesturing to the untouched feast.

“Oh, I’m fine. Qiaoqiao must be starving though,” Guan Yu replied gently.

Wang Jie blinked. *This boy’s slick—already doting on her?* “Qiaoqiao says your family’s wealth dwarfs the Fangs. True? Heh, I can hardly believe it!” She chuckled awkwardly at her own bluntness.

*Snobs through and through. For them, only their precious daughter rivals money’s importance,* Guan Yu mused.

“Honestly, I don’t have much myself. My sisters fund me,” he admitted.

Lin Zhiyu stiffened. *Living off sisters? What a deadbeat! No woman’s earnings could match Fang Wenjian, a tycoon!*

“What business are you in?” Lin Zhiyu pressed.

“Me? Unemployed. Just idle at home.”

Though truthful, the answer wiped the smiles off the parents’ faces. *No job yet claims wealth? That’s like a blind man talking in the dark—pure nonsense!*

Wang Jie probed further, “So you mooch off your sisters daily? Are they wealthy?”

“Quite. They bought my house and cars.”

Lin Qiaoqiao chimed in through mouthfuls, “True! His villa’s in Qiaoyuan District’s luxury zone! And his car’s worth a fortune!”

Her parents exchanged stunned glances. *Could this be real?* Lin Zhiyu leaned forward eagerly. “What do your sisters do?”

“Ever heard of Huayu Group?” Guan Yu dropped the bombshell he’d been withholding.

“Of course! A top conglomerate in China! What’s the connection?” The money-obsessed couple perked up.

“Huayu Group belongs to my sisters.”

Silence. Then—gasps. Even Lin Qiaoqiao gaped. Her parents’ eyes bulged comically.

Lin Zhiyu’s mind raced until—*SLAM!* He slapped the table, jolting upright. “Guan Yu… You’re the chairman of Huayu Group?!” Wang Jie shot to her feet, staring as if he’d vanish if she blinked.

Guan Yu nodded. Lin Qiaoqiao reeled—she’d never connected her friend to the corporate titan, though it made sense. Xue Jing, her wealthy friend whose philanthropist father approved of Guan Yu… He *had* to be extraordinary.

Forgetting he was merely borrowed for the night, Lin Qiaoqiao preened—perhaps her own latent snobbery surfacing. “See? Guan Yu outshines that Fang loser! There’s more—Yang’s heiress is his girlfriend!”

“Right! Old Master Yang himself announced Guan Yu as his son-in-law! To win the city’s top beauty—such prestige!” Wang Jie babbled, thumping his shoulder excitedly.

“Wait, what?” Guan Yu frowned as Lin Qiaoqiao rambled on: “His Qiaoyuan villa has beauties galo—”

*Cough!* Guan Yu hacked loudly, cutting her off with a panicked look. *What’s she doing?!*

Lin Zhiyu’s face turned chartreuse, seemingly holding his breath.

Lin Qiaoqiao froze—*Oops.* Wang Jie snapped back to reality, bewildered. “Qiaoqiao, explain! If he’s taken, why claim he’s your boyfriend?”

*Busted.* Lin Qiaoqiao’s pleading eyes turned to Guan Yu.

He sighed. “Uncle, Aunt—I’m just helping Qiaoqiao fake a relationship to repel the Fangs.”

“So this whole night’s a joke?!” Wang Jie’s voice quivered. Lin Qiaoqiao studied her shoes.

“Qiaoqiao… You’ve gone too far.” Lin Zhiyu stood trembling, fury contained only by parental love. Exchanging resigned glances, the couple left without another word—pausing only at the door to murmur, “Don’t stay out late.”

“Okay…” Lin Qiaoqiao replied meekly, guilt-stricken.

**Chapter 2453: Deceived**

Alone in the silent room, Lin Qiaoqiao kicked the table leg with her stiletto. “Why’d it go so wrong? They’ve never been this angry…”

Guan Yu rose. “At least we drove the Fangs away. They’ll forgive you. Just show more filial piety later.”

“Still… thanks.” Her tone softened. “You’ve helped so much.”

“No need. Friends help friends. Besides, I can’t handle a police captain’s gratitude.” His jest disarmed her usual temper.

Yet her heart conflicted—yearning to join Qiaoyuan’s women but daunted by their numbers. Meanwhile, Xue Jing waited outside, spying until the furious parents and scowling suitor left. *Success!* she thought—until hours passed with no sign of Guan Yu or Lin Qiaoqiao.

*Are they…? No!* Bursting into the room, she found only a curtain-rope dangling from the window. *They escaped!*

Fuming, Xue Jing was intercepted by a server: “Miss Xue? Mr. Guan said you’d pay the 889-yuan bill.”

Grudgingly settling it, she stormed out—only to get texts:

Guan Yu: *Thanks for covering dinner. Accompanying Qiaoqiao home as her “boyfriend.” Don’t wait.*

Lin Qiaoqiao: *You lent him for a day! We ditched your tail. Don’t be mad! 😆*

Xue Jing seethed but conceded—she’d been outsmarted. *Just keep this from the sisters… And pray they don’t “cook the rice” tonight!*

**Chapter 2454: Taking You Home**

Guan Yu’s convertible roared down the road, bass thumping as Lin Qiaoqiao danced in her seat. “So thrilling! First time escaping a restaurant like that!”

“You need more excitement,” he laughed.

“My life’s been dull—few friends, most girls can’t stand me, guys just pretend.”

Earlier, after her parents left, Guan Yu had detected Xue Jing’s stakeout. They’d crafted their curtain-rope escape, even lingering in the lobby to ensure Xue Jing paid—a final prank.

“How’d you know she followed us?” Lin Qiaoqiao asked.

“Two clues: One, my sisters forbid solo outings—Xue Jing’s been scolded before. Two, I texted Yingzi—Xue Jing wasn’t home.”

“Brilliant! You should be a detective!”

“Pass. Fiction’s not reality.”

“Where now?”

“Taking you home.”
