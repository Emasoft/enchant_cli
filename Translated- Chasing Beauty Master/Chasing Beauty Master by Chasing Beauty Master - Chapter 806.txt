Chapter 2044: We’re Law-Abiding Citizens

With their leader gone, the crowd became utterly leaderless. Guan Yu’s words further rattled them, leaving them momentarily paralyzed with indecision.

These people had all acted under Cao Jin’s orders. Though Guan Yu didn’t wish to punish them harshly, he couldn’t simply let them off scot-free either.

Many among the opposing group were injured, some so severely trampled during the chaos that they still couldn’t stand. It was a miracle they hadn’t been crushed to death.

Guan Yu casually grabbed two individuals from the crowd—both异能者 who had ambushed him earlier while he dealt with Cao Jin. Clutching their collars, he pushed through the throng as people hastily cleared a path for him.

Emerging from the crowd, Guan Yu tossed the two men before a dozen police officers. Addressing Officer Huang Shan, he declared, “Officer Huang, these two are the ringleaders. They injured many of our classmates and served as Cao Jin’s key subordinates. With Cao Jin fled, you can interrogate them for information.”

Huang Shan nodded approvingly. “Guan Yu, have your classmates disperse now.”

“Officer Huang, that’s unacceptable,” Guan Yu retorted indignantly. “These Century Garden Academy students blocked our school gates for half an hour without reason and injured so many of us. We can’t just let them walk away!”

Huang Shan knew Guan Yu wasn’t one to back down easily. Though superficially his claims held truth, most visible injuries actually belonged to the opposing side.

“Guan Yu, trust me on this,” Huang Shan insisted. “I’ll take these two for questioning and ensure compensation is provided.”

Despite her assurance, Guan Yu couldn’t resist teasing her. The policewoman’s explosive curves strained against her tight uniform, her delicate features flushed with urgency beneath snow-white skin.

“Officer Huang, that sounds irresponsible,” Guan Yu countered. “Shall I have all my classmates check into hospitals for full-body examinations? Every cold, fever, or scraped knee—will your side cover all medical costs?”

Wei Hongwei, seizing the moment, shouted theatrically: “Let’s go, everyone! Full medical checkups from head to toe!”

The crowd erupted in agreement:
“Perfect—I’ve been worried about my health!”
“Hospital it is!”
“My girlfriend’s waiting for a movie date after this!”

As hundreds began marching toward imagined hospital visits, Huang Shan’s face reddened with panic. “Wait! Students, please listen—”

Guan Yu, watching the frantic officer with amusement, finally raised his hand. “Hold on, everyone. Let’s hear what solution the officer proposes.” His authority instantly stilled the crowd.

Relief washed over Huang Shan. A stampede of hundreds to hospitals would dominate tomorrow’s headlines—a disaster she’d be held accountable for.

“What do you want, Guan Yu?” she gritted out, aware she was being manipulated but powerless to resist.

“We’re law-abiding citizens and good students,” Guan Yu declared, squatting before the two captives. “We demand 500,000 yuan compensation—peanuts for your bosses, right?” His menacing glare prompted frantic nodding: “No problem! No problem at all!”

“If all these students actually went to hospitals, half a million might not suffice,” Guan Yu added sweetly. “Officer Huang, I trust you’ll transfer the funds by tomorrow.”

Huang Shan clenched her teeth, recognizing the extortion yet acknowledging the instigators’ culpability. “Done. Now disperse everyone—the roads have been blocked for hours!”

“Students!” Guan Yu announced. “Compensation arrives tomorrow—Wei Hongwei, tally the headcount! Everyone gets their share!”

The crowd dissolved into chatter:
“Dinner time!”
“LAN gaming session!”
“Movie date here I come!”

Within minutes, the streets cleared. Huang Shan’s team arrested several Century Garden ringleaders while Guan Yu suddenly remembered—he’d left an injured woman waiting for food!

Rushing to Pan Taisheng Apartments, he found Qing Ling’er already waiting with purchased medicine. After chiding her for waiting outdoors, he carried her princess-style into the Sun Family courtyard. Though brief, the contact stirred longing in Ling’er—his embrace felt irresistibly safe and warm.

Inside, Jin Hua greeted him with mock fury: “Stinking Guan Yu! Starving me all day—trying to murder your wife?” Her complaints masked genuine affection; solitude had been unbearable with limited mobility.

As Guan Yu laid out KFC fare, Ling’er intervened: “Patients need proper nutrition!” Soon, her home-cooked meal of vegetables, meat, and soup replaced fast food, earning praise from both diners.

Later, driving Ling’er home, Guan Yu voiced concerns about her father’s planned hunt for protected snakes’ gallbladders. Ling’er sighed: “Survival leaves no choice.”

After midnight, returning to Jin Hua, Guan Yu dressed in stolen Sun Family ninja gear—black outfit, coiled rope, military dagger. His target: the Feng Family’s legendary Ten Thousand Year Demonic Domain artifact to cure Qing Guanghui’s venom.

Chapter 2045: Good Food Waits for No One

Jin Hua’s complaints echoed earlier as Guan Yu arrived with belated dinner. Though she grumbled about KFC, her heart warmed—solitary days spent watching TV and sleeping had deepened her longing.

Immobile and bored, even bathroom trips became arduous journeys. Her scoldings stemmed purely from missing him.

“Sorry, Cao Jin caused trouble at school…” Guan Yu explained while unpacking fried chicken.

Ling’er soon replaced junk food with homemade dishes. Despite Jin Hua’s superior culinary skills (honed serving Yang Conghan), the trio devoured the simple meal gratefully.

Post-dinner, Guan Yu escorted Ling’er home, discussing her father’s dangerous medicinal quest en route. Avoiding upstairs goodbyes to respect family time, he then informed his housemates he wouldn’t return tonight.

Returning to Jin Hua, he carried her to bed and inquired about stealth gear. The Sun Family’s storage room revealed dozens of black ops outfits—legacy of their shady security team.

Dressed in ninja black with dagger and rope, Guan Yu infiltrated the Feng compound. Contrary to expectations of grandeur, their “mansion” proved modest—a two-story quadrangle surrounded by chain-link fencing.

Evading lax guards discussing women, Guan Yu found surveillance cameras plentiful but poorly placed. Discovering a locked basement entrance beneath camera coverage, he aborted approach.

After fruitless searching, he ambushed a drunken guard: “Where’s the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Domain?”

“M-mercy, sir! I don’t know!” the terrified man blubbered, sobering instantly under dagger pressure.

Chapter 2046: The Fake Bodyguard

The Feng residence’s unimpressive exterior belied its labyrinthine interior. Endless corridors and camera angles forced Guan Yu to retreat and capture a guard for interrogation.

The inebriated captive proved useless—either ignorant or too panicked to comprehend. Guan Yu’s mission to steal the mythical artifact faced complications, yet determination burned: this relic could save a life, and he’d stop at nothing to obtain it.
