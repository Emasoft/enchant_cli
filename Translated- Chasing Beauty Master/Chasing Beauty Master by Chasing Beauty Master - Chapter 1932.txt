“That is indeed the case. However, we cannot determine whether the beast truly escaped through here. It’s equally possible that the cave entrance over there is its nesting ground—its true lair.” Jiang Yuankai said, “There might be an exit ahead here, but it could simply mirror the entrance we came through. The beast likely isn’t there.”

Jiang Yuankai’s reasoning held merit. While the presence of wind indicated an exit, it didn’t guarantee the beast’s path. The creature was severely wounded—particularly from Jiang Yuankai’s sword strike, which even rapid regeneration couldn’t swiftly mend—and Guan Yu’s crossbow bolt lodged in its mouth would remain a perpetual torment.

“Let’s proceed with the original plan,” Jiang Yuankai continued. “The wind in this tunnel is auspicious. You two take this route to locate the exit. I’ll venture deeper to confirm whether the beast remains. If I encounter it, dispatching it won’t trouble me. If not, we’ll know it fled through the other passage.”

“Agreed. We cannot afford to overlook any opportunity,” Guan Yu replied. “Time is critical. Let’s move. Brother Jiang, stay vigilant.”

“You as well. If danger arises, prioritize survival over confrontation.” Raising his torch, Jiang Yuankai turned and strode into the darkness.

Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong advanced cautiously. As they progressed, the water beneath their feet receded, and the walls grew less damp. The exit seemed near—a secondary passage, as Jiang Yuankai had surmised, rather than the beast’s lair.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yuankai navigated the deepening gloom, his torch flickering weakly. The path sloped downward, water trickling ahead. A sudden gust of wind halted him. By the torch’s dying light, he stood motionless, listening intently.

“Perhaps I’m overreacting,” he muttered after a prolonged silence. Resuming his march, determination hardened his resolve—he would slay the beast and rid the people of this scourge. His foot crunched on a loose stone, the sharp crack echoing through the tunnel.

A palpable breeze swept past his ears. No illusion this time—the airflow was unmistakable. As the torch guttered out, plunging him into absolute darkness, Jiang Yuankai froze. Eyes closed, he acclimated to the blackness. Gradually, faint noises emerged—not the beast’s growls, but the chittering of countless rodents.

**Chapter 5077: Vampire Bats**

When Jiang Yuankai reopened his eyes, the horrific sight made his scalp prickle. Countless gleaming eyes stared back—a swarm of vampire bats hungrily observing their prey. These cave-dwelling blood-drinkers, luminous eyes like celestial stars, could reduce a man to bones in moments. Their frenzied cries suggested prolonged starvation.

Jaw clenched, Jiang Yuankai stood statue-still, barely breathing. Flight was impossible—he’d never outpace winged predators. Gripping his broadsword, he prepared for a grueling battle. Unlike cultivators who could conjure protective shields, he relied solely on martial skill.

The torch’s wooden handle clattered to the ground—a trigger. The swarm surged. Jiang Yuankai’s blade became a whirlwind, internal energy extending its reach into a three-meter radius of lethal light. Each swing felled dozens, yet the onslaught continued. Bites pierced his shoulder and ankle, venomous numbness spreading.

Though bat corpses piled waist-high, staining the waters crimson, the swarm seemed endless. Jiang Yuankai’s breaths grew labored, movements slowing. His golden energy sphere—a defensive maelstrom of blade strokes—repelled the onslaught, yet exhaustion neared.

Abruptly, the bats retreated, chittering signals. Jiang Yuankai exhaled in relief—until a thunderous impact shook the tunnel. The colossal ant-beast emerged, swiping aside bat carcasses. Its carapace bore unhealed wounds: Guan Yu’s mercury-laced bolt embedded in its ventral maw, Jiang Yuankai’s tail slash still raw.

**Chapter 5078: Poisoned**

Weakness flooded Jiang Yuankai’s limbs. Bat venom sapped his strength; black blood oozed from swollen wounds. Even retreat seemed impossible now. The beast hesitated, clawing at its poisoned injury—a vulnerability.

“You’re as battered as I,” Jiang Yuankai growled, raising his sword left-handed. “Let’s end this!”

The beast lunged. Jiang Yuankai barely blocked the first strike, crashing into stone. Rising unsteadily, his right arm paralyzed, he barely deflected the next blow. The creature trumpeted triumphantly—its prey cornered.

**Chapter 5079: Timely Rescue**

As the beast prepared its final strike, a crossbow bolt thudded into its eye. Guan Yu’s voice rang out: “Fall back, Brother Jiang!” Wang Xiaorong’s daggers flashed, severing tendons. The beast roared, thrashing blindly.

Dragging Jiang Yuankai clear, Guan Yu administered antidote. “We followed the bats’ retreat,” he explained. Jiang Yuankai nodded weakly as the beast’s death throes shook the cavern. Survival—for now—but greater perils undoubtedly awaited deeper within the labyrinthine dark.
