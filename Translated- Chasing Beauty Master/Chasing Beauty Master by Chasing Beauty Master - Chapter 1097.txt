The waitress secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, that lecherous brute had grabbed her, giving her the chance to escalate the situation. Otherwise, they might have retrieved that wallet. Not only did she now rightfully claim the tens of thousands inside, but she'd also gained an extra two thousand yuan.

Had Poison Widow not paid up earlier, the waitress might not have shown the surveillance footage anyway. One careless moment revealing her finding the wallet would have meant returning that hefty sum to its owner.

**Chapter 2805: Try Me If You Don’t Believe It**

Just as the waitress hesitated, Poison Widow sent the money over. Not one to refuse easy gains, the quick-witted waitress accepted it, incidentally driving them away in the process.

After exiting the mall, Jiu Biyun’s face darkened. *Smack!* A sharp slap landed on Yuan Shanding’s face. “You shameless old dog!” she roared. “How dare you grope some girl right under my nose? Have you no decency left?”

The slap left Yuan Shanding dazed. Jiu Biyun’s strength wasn’t trivial—stars danced before his eyes. Had no one been watching, he might have admitted fault. The young waitress *was* pretty, and he’d momentarily lost control.

But with Poison Widow witnessing this humiliation, Yuan Shanding’s pride flared. “Who the hell are you to control me?” he spat. “Looking for another beating?”

Though knowing he couldn’t overpower Jiu Biyun, Yuan Shanding lunged anyway—he couldn’t swallow this insult. Surely Poison Widow would intervene before things escalated beyond mere slaps.

As Yuan Shanding swung back, Jiu Biyun dodged and sneered, “You’ve truly outdone yourself! Disgracing us publicly—you’ve no shame, but I do!”

Their shouting match devolved into scuffles. Poison Widow sighed, uncertain how to mediate this marital spat. Yuan Shanding *had* been reckless—such behavior might fly in remote mountains, but here, it risked police involvement.

Yet in their world, powerful men often kept multiple wives. Jiu Biyun’s public humiliation seemed excessive. What man could tolerate such treatment?

“Enough!” Poison Widow finally shouted. “Must you air your filth here? Have you no dignity left?”

Seizing the exit, Yuan Shanding growled at Jiu Biyun, “Wait till we’re home, you hag! I’ll take a concubine tomorrow—see if I don’t!”

“Try it!” Jiu Biyun shot back. “I’ll kill every whore you bring! Test me!”

Their verbal barrage continued all the way back to the Feng residence. Truthfully, Jiu Biyun’s anger stemmed more from losing money, while Yuan Shanding sought to salvage his pride before Poison Widow.

Bill Lin frowned at their flushed faces. “What happened? Weren’t you just shopping?”

Poison Widow massaged her temples. “Petty squabbles. Headache-inducing.”

But Jiu Biyun, beyond caring, blurted, “This pervert groped a waitress! Got caught red-handed!”

Bill Lin chuckled. “Such a trivial matter? Hardly worth this drama.”

“See?” Yuan Shanding jabbed. “Even Brother Bill says it’s nothing! You overreacting shrew!”

“Who’s the shameless one here?” Jiu Biyun advanced, hand raised threateningly.

“Enough!” Yuan Shandon bellowed. “I’m sending you back to the mountains tomorrow! Stay there and spare me this humiliation!”

Alarmed, Bill Lin interjected—Jiu Biyun’s martial prowess was too valuable to lose. “Let’s discuss this calmly. Madam Jiu, striking your husband publicly undermines his dignity. Private disputes should stay private.”

**Chapter 2806: Sound Advice**

Turning to Yuan Shanding, Bill continued, “While men’s urges are natural, public misconduct risks legal trouble here. This isn’t your mountain domain.”

Poison Widow smiled approvingly. “Master Bill mediates well. They’ve been bickering nonstop.”

Internally, she sided with Yuan—men taking lovers seemed ordinary, though timing mattered. Jiu Biyun’s harshness felt excessive.

“Let’s focus,” Bill redirected. “We need Madam Jiu for tomorrow’s operation.” He outlined his plan against Guan Yu’s three monk subordinates at Houyuan Temple.

“Eliminating these lieutenants weakens Guan Yu,” Poison Widow nodded. “Wise strategy.”

Yuan Shanding frowned. “Where’s this temple? Let’s strike tonight!”

“Patience,” Bill cautioned. “These monks are formidable cultivators. We need strategy, not brute force.”

After refining their plan, Yuan Shanding selected twenty men. At dawn, three inconspicuous vans with fake plates carried them toward the temple.

**Chapter 2807: Easy Target?**

The temple gates creaked open under Yuan’s push. A young acolyte in hemp robes appeared. “We seek lodging,” Yuan stated. “Travelers passing through.”

The monk Shengsheng assessed them—outsiders, all martial artists. “Four per room,” he decided, directing them to rear quarters.

A henchman protested the cramped arrangement. “Why not use empty front rooms?”

“Master’s orders,” the acolyte stood firm.

“Brat asking for—” The thug raised his hand, but Yuan stopped him. The young monk remained unflinching—perhaps tougher than he looked.
