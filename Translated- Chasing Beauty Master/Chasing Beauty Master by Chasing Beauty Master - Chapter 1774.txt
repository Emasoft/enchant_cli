In the center stood a circular table of extraordinary opulence, its magnificence forming stark contrast to the crude wooden bed nearby.

Covered with gold-threaded cloth, the table bore a tea set crafted from pure gold and other valuables. By the wall, a square table caught Guan Yu’s attention with a glowing object atop it.

Compelled to investigate, Guan Yu strode forward but paused cautiously upon entering, scanning for threats. When no danger arose, he approached the square table.

The radiant object revealed itself as a fist-sized black gemstone brimming with spiritual energy, its luster mirroring the massive black gem embedded in the waterfall. Such a treasure could forge a supreme magical artifact in skilled hands. Yet Guan Yu’s true quarry lay elsewhere—the Eight-Drum Technique.

His gaze lifted to an expansive scroll adorning the wall. Below its ink-painted landscape of blooming flora and singing birds, golden symbols shimmered and undulated across the blank upper portion. A smile touched Guan Yu’s lips. “Obtaining it without any effort—I’ve finally found you.”

This was unmistakably the Eight-Drum Technique. The golden sigils matched those within the Imperial Seal, though their meaning remained cryptic. Centuries ago, Patriarch Meng Hua had concealed the technique here, embedding it so ingeniously within the scroll that none would recognize it.

Guan Yu summoned the Imperial Seal, intent on absorbing the technique, but hesitated. How to extract the sigils without removing the entire scroll? Carrying the artwork would draw immediate suspicion from the Right Envoy, Red Lotus Sect, and True Sun Sect waiting outside.

An idea struck him. He projected his consciousness into the Imperial Seal’s artifact spirit. “I require your counsel!”

The spirit materialized as a smoky visage, weary yet sardonic. “Disturbing my studies, Master? What urgent matter brings you?”

“The technique is trapped within a scroll. How do I retrieve it?”

The spirit chuckled. “Struck by rare stupidity? Release traces of the technique you already possess. Let resonance draw its counterpart forth.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit with understanding. Returning to reality, he heard muffled combat outside—Elder Miao struggling to hold the invaders at bay.

Panicked shouts echoed as Guan Yu sealed the chamber door. He channeled spiritual energy through the Imperial Seal, releasing wisps of the Eight-Drum Technique’s aura. The scroll’s symbols flared in response, golden sigls tearing free to orbit Guan Yu like eager fireflies.

As he raised the seal, the symbols streamed into it—until the door exploded inward.

Chaos erupted. The room quaked, pristine furnishings crumbling to dust. Only golden items survived the dissolution, including the black gem now reduced to ash. Dust motes coalesced into cryptic verses:

*“Longevity’s Celebration, Radiant Sovereign
Snow-crowned Golden Hall, Destiny’s Revelation.”*

The words faded as the structure collapsed. Guan Yu lunged outside, finding Elder Miao’s bloodied corpse—slain by invaders.

“Where’s the technique?” the Right Envoy demanded.

Guan Yu spread his hands, feigning frustration. “Your intrusion destroyed everything! The chamber disintegrated before I could—”

“Lies!” she countered. “Why did clues for the next technique appear if this one wasn’t activated?”

A tense standoff ensued until Wang Jun redirected concerns: “How do we escape this realm? The entrance portal vanished!”

Panic spread. Without Elder Miao’s knowledge, they faced potential entrapment for years. Guan Yu subtly steered blame: “Killing our only guide was remarkably shortsighted.”

Under pressure, the Right Envoy inspected Guan Yu but detected no trace of the technique. Reluctantly, suspicion eased—though her doubts lingered like poison.

As arguments swirled, Guan Yu concealed his triumph. The Eight-Drum Technique pulsed safely within the Imperial Seal, its secret guarded while false leads consumed his rivals. Survival now depended on maintaining the ruse—and deciphering the mysterious verses pointing to their next trial.
