Siqi’s question drew laughter from the group. Xiao Zhi chuckled and explained, “Because they broke divine taboos. Those two spirit beasts were male and female. When they dwelled in the heavens, the deity who reared them forbade their union. Yet over time, affection blossomed between them. Unable to resist their feelings, they were discovered by the deity, who cast them down to the mortal realm and imprisoned them in separate caves—close enough to sense each other’s presence, yet eternally denied reunion.”

“That’s truly twisted,” Siqi murmured, though everyone heard her. They were surprised she’d utter such words, but the tale’s cruelty had unwittingly drawn the outburst.

Xiao Zhi smiled reassuringly. “No need to dwell on it, Siqi. These are just folk tales—fabrications. Why take them seriously?”

“Whether true or false, it’s still a tragedy,” Siqi countered. “Spirit beasts are living beings with emotions. Why deny them companionship and trap them here forever?”

Her icy exterior belied a tender heart, visibly moved by Xiao Zhi’s casual storytelling.

Guanyu interjected, “The caves imprisoning those beasts—are they the same ones people vanish into?”

“Exactly,” Xiao Zhi confirmed. “Should we investigate? See if the legends hold truth?”

Guanyu shook his head. “Better not. I value my life. These are mere beast legends, not the entrance to Ancestor Menghua’s ruins. Why risk it?”

“Since when does fearless Guanyu fear death?” Xiao Zhi teased.

“Stop joking. If you’re so brave, go yourself,” Guanyu retorted, turning to leave. His reluctance stemmed not from personal fear but concern for others’ safety.

Had he been alone, exploration might tempt him. But with so many disappearances, involving Xiao Zhi and the group was unwise.

“Hey! Where are you going?” Xiao Zhi called as Guanyu walked away.

Without looking back, Guanyu replied, “Night approaches. Planning to camp here? I’m heading to Uncle’s for dinner. I’m starving.”

Xiao Zhi glanced at the setting sun, a chill creeping down his spine at the thought of nocturnal spirit beasts. “Wait for us! I’m hungry too. Let’s go.”

After their fruitless investigation of Treasure Mountain—an ordinary peak offering no clues—the group returned to Uncle’s residence. At dinner, Guanyu proposed, “Let’s relocate to Jiangwei Town. It’d be more convenient.”

“What?” Xiao Zhi objected. “That backwater lacks decent inns. Where would we stay?”

“There are teahouses,” Guanyu countered. “If the Crimson Lotus Sect lodges there, why can’t we?”

Uncle, sensing possible dissatisfaction, interjected, “Guanyu, you’ve barely stayed two days. Though duty calls, allow me to extend proper hospitality awhile longer.”

Xiao Zhi nodded vigorously. “Uncle’s home is comfortable.”

“If anything lacks here,” Uncle pressed, “name it, and I’ll have servants arrange it.”

Guanyu’s suggestion stemmed purely from Jiangwei’s proximity to Treasure Mountain. Not wishing to offend, he conceded, “Just a thought. Since Xiao Zhi objects, we’ll stay. I’ve no complaints.”

Restless that night, Guanyu wandered to the mansion’s rear garden—a landscaped marvel with a circular pond bordered by blooming flowers. At its center rose an artificial mountain cascading water, likely fed by a spring, its outflow disappearing through a channel.

“Not tired yet?” Second-to-Wolf materialized beside him.

“Expected you,” Guanyu said flatly. “Forget my fatigue—why steal their Jade Bagua? Courting some woman? Doubt any could catch your eye.”

“Damn! How’d you know?” Second-to-Wolf grumbled. “Even without prospects, maybe I’ll gift it to Sakurako later!”

“That’s their treasure! Blame falls on me. They won’t let this go.”

“Since when do you fear trouble?” Second-to-Wolf eyed him curiously. “You’ve changed since that injury—cautious, unlike your old reckless self.”

“I don’t fear trouble—I avoid it. The Crimson Lotus is orthodox. Though their disciples are lacking, we needn’t make enemies.”

“Too late. They already deem you foes, knowing you’re Azure Cloud disciples. This storm can’t be dodged.”

Tossing the Jade Bagua to Guanyu, Second-to-Wolf added, “Heard this holds secrets. Thought you’d want to study it.”

The jade felt cool and smooth in Guanyu’s hand—translucent emerald perfection. “I’ve no interest in others’ trinkets. Return it when we meet them, before tensions escalate.”

“Pathetic,” Second-to-Wolf scoffed, departing. “I’m taking your bed tonight. Sleeping rough grows tiresome.”

“Where do I sleep then?”

“Figure it out or perish.”

Dawn brought commotion. A servant explained visitors demanded justice—Guanyu had “wronged” someone.

Approaching the front hall, Guanyu spotted Crimson Lotus disciples Yue Jing and Lai Lixia arguing with Xiao Zhi and A’Ze.

Second-to-Wolf’s theft had backfired. Returning the artifact now would admit guilt, tarnishing Azure Cloud’s reputation.

“Back for more? Yesterday’s beating wasn’t enough?” A’Ze taunted.

Yue Jing, flanked by fellow disciples, seethed. Guanyu intervened calmly, “Quarreling only amuses the Demon Sect. Can’t we discuss this?”

Lai Lixia, surprised by his reasonableness, softened. “We seek something vital—our sect’s Jade Bagua. Only you had opportunity. Please return it.”

“Either hand it over or die!” Yue Jing brandished his sword, desperation glistening on his brow.

Guanyu feigned ignorance. “We don’t have it. But as fellow orthodox sects, we’ll help search. Better we find it than the Demon Sect.”

Even Yue Jing wavered at his sincerity. Lai Lixia nodded. “We trust you. Alert us immediately if found.”

“Of course,” Guanyu agreed. “Join us for breakfast first?”

“No time!” Yue Jing stormed off.

Xiao Zhi spat, “That prick! Why humor them?”

“We’ve our own mission,” Guanyu reasoned. “Fewer enemies mean smoother progress. Finding their relic could forge alliances against the Demon Sect.”

“Or make them accuse us of theft!”

Guanyu pondered discarding the jade—a magnet for trouble.

**Chapter 3418: Echo Pavilion**

Post-breakfast, Guanyu proposed, “I’m going out. Coming?”

Siqi declined. “I’ll cultivate in my room today.”

Xiao Zhi instructed servants, “Attend to her needs, Steward Sun.”

The steward bowed. Guanyu studied him—beneath benign demeanor lurked unsettling depths.

“Where’s Uncle?” Guanyu asked.

“Master left early on business,” Steward Sun replied. “Your words inspired new ventures.”

In bustling Qujiang City’s chaotic markets—where cosmetics stalls neighbored bakeries—Guanyu queried Xiao Zhi, “Was Uncle’s former steward, Chen Shu, a cultivator?”

“Yes. How’d you know? He retired ill. Uncle treated him like family—managed affairs for decades.”

“Why’s the new steward, Sun, feel... off?”

Xiao Zhi shrugged. “Who knows? Maybe promoted servant or outside hire.”

Guanyu’s instincts prickled—Steward Sun’s benign mask hid shadows demanding scrutiny.
