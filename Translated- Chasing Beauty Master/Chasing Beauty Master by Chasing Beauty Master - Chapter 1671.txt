“I originally planned to flee at dawn tomorrow. If Ling Su reports me, it’ll spell disaster.” Lin Chen placed the hundred taels from his person and the fifty taels given by Guan Yu on the table. “Look, everyone—the silver here is more than enough for our needs. My serving you steamed buns and pickled vegetables isn’t because I’ve gambled away all our funds. Reducing rich foods is part of my philosophy of health cultivation.

Theoretically, eating more meat gives laborers strength and vigor, but this applies to physical workers. For immortal cultivators like us, excessive nutrition is unnecessary. Balanced meals of vegetables and modest proteins promote better health. You should all understand this.”

“I don’t care about your ‘balance’!” Ling Su retorted. “At Cloud Azure Sect, I always ate the finest dishes. When deliveries came from Qianhui Peak, I ate the most—and you never held back either! Why preach about moderation now? Are you rationing our food?”

Most disciples didn’t mind the simple fare—being fed was enough outdoors, unlike their idle sect life. Guan Yu had no intention of removing Lin Chen yet; the deputy leader remained useful against Ling Su.

Guan Yu rose with a conciliatory smile. “Ling Su, don’t be hasty. Lin Chen speaks sense. Our journey has just begun. Conserving supplies is prudent. Once we reach the desert, even buns and pickles may vanish. We might lack even a drop of water. Prepare for hardships.”

Ling Su hadn’t expected Guan Yu’s support. Though unafraid of Lin Chen, he couldn’t afford to clash with the leader. He’d planned to expose Lin Chen’s borrowed silver, forcing repayment, but discovered lenders required collateral and local residency.

Lin Chen must have lied to obtain loans. “For Guan Yu’s sake,” Ling Su sneered, “I won’t report you—if you meet one condition.”

Resigned, Lin Chen pocketed the silver. Was this about extortion? “Very well. As deputy leader, I’ll hear your terms.”

“Borrow fifty taels for me. You know I’m broke. Refuse, and I’ll expose you.”

Trapped, Lin Chen protested, “The moneylenders are closed! You ask the impossible!”

“Find a way. Get me fifty taels by tomorrow, or face consequences.” Ling Su resumed eating, savoring the humble meal.

Lin Chen glared venomously. Their feud bewildered onlookers—these inseparable sect brothers now clashing over silver... or deeper tensions?

“It’s not about money,” whispered Wang Jun to A’Ze, nodding toward Siqi. Understanding dawned—this was rivalry over a woman.

Ling Su calculated: even twenty taels from Lin Chen’s stash would let him gamble downstairs. Meanwhile, Lin Chen feigned confidence. “Report me if you dare! I borrowed fairly through local relatives. At worst, I’ll be embarrassed—not ruined.”

Bluffing worked. Hesitating, Ling Su wavered. Seizing the moment, Lin Chen produced twenty taels. “Take this. Gamble small—and remember our brotherhood.”

Suspicious but tempted, Ling Su snatched the silver. “This doesn’t settle things. We’ll see who laughs last.” He stormed out to bet.

Alone, Lin Chen collapsed onto a stool, wiping sweat. The crisis was postponed—but for how long?

**Chapter 4370: Expulsion**

Cornered by Ling Su’s blackmail, Lin Chen allocated rooms, deliberately pairing with his rival. Confronted privately, Ling Su raged: “You snake! Stealing near Siqi when my back was turned!”

“She’s not yours to claim!” Lin Chen countered. “Anyone may court her. Bother her again, and Guan Yu will expel you!”

“Expel me? You?! You’re a scheming dwarf she’d never choose!”

The insult stung. “Mock my height all you like. Siqi prefers me. Test this, and you’ll be marching home in disgrace!” Throwing open the door, Lin Chen roared, “Get out! Report me and see what happens!”

Ling Su faltered. What if the loans were legitimate? Lin Chen pressed his advantage: “The moneylenders aren’t fools. I’ve borrowed thrice—300 taels! Would they lend without collateral? Go verify my local kin if you doubt!”

The gamble worked. Ling Su’s bravado crumbled. “So... you really can borrow?”

“Obviously. Now take twenty taels and gamble—but cross me again, and our friendship dies.”

**Chapter 4371: Go Play**

Ling Su pocketed the silver, threats abandoned... for now. Downstairs, disciples diced with meager stakes—their sect-funded expedition made losses meaningless.

Lin Chen slumped, exhausted. His ruse held—but vigilance remained. Tomorrow’s departure couldn’t come soon enough.

Meanwhile, Ling Su joined the gamblers, plotting future schemes. Alliance with Guan Yu might secure his position... and revenge.

The dice clattered. Silver changed hands. Somewhere above, Lin Chen stared at the ceiling, Siqi’s face in his mind, counting hours till dawn.
