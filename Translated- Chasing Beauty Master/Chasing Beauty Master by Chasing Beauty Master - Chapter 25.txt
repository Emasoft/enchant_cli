“This…” Guan Yu believed it, but what he was more certain of was that the other party didn’t want to take risks. If a single shot didn’t kill him instantly, the woman in his arms would undoubtedly have her neck snapped by his grip.

Tilting his head, Guan Yu ducked behind Feng Xin’s back, pressing his entire body tightly against hers. The faint fragrance from her hair filled his senses, but he had no mind to dwell on such things—this was a matter of life and death!

“Let me ask you one last thing,” Guan Yu licked his lips and said slowly. “After I take my revenge, will you let me go…”

He could leave right now, but… he hadn’t found Wang Fubin yet. Tonight, Guan Yu wanted to settle everything with that scum in one go. Why drag it out?

“If I say yes, would you believe me?” Feng Xin sneered softly.

Others might not take this risk, but Guan Yu was different. With his Detection Technique, discerning whether she truly intended to release him was as simple as activating the skill.

A sudden idea flashed through his mind. He activated the Detection Technique on the bodyguard before him. In an instant, streams of information flooded his consciousness—he could now perceive the man’s thoughts.

Oh? Guan Yu’s eyebrow twitched imperceptibly. The feedback revealed low lethal intent: the bodyguard planned to disable him with a non-fatal shot, then deal with him privately elsewhere.

So he’s afraid of complications too. This changes things. A faint smile curved Guan Yu’s lips.

**Chapter 59: The Sudden Counterattack**

With his Detection Technique confirming the bodyguard’s reluctance to kill, Guan Yu’s spirits lifted. Knowing his opponent’s intentions, he felt confident in seizing the pistol through a surprise move.

“Before I leave, there’s one more thing I must do,” Guan Yu said slowly, peeking at the black-clad man.

“Did I agree to let you go? You’re the first to ever hold a blade to my neck,” Feng Xin retorted coldly, her voice dripping with displeasure.

“Ah, so I’ve taken your ‘first time.’ Should I feel honored?” Guan Yu chuckled. Suddenly, he grabbed Feng Xin’s slender waist and hurled her body like a projectile toward the bodyguard.

Neither anticipated Guan Yu’s abrupt violence nor his terrifying strength—swinging a full-grown woman as effortlessly as a ragdoll. As the bodyguard reflexively lowered his gun to catch Feng Xin, Guan Yu lunged forward. He yanked Feng Xin’s clothing backward while seizing the bodyguard’s collar with one hand and grabbing his crotch with the other. Activating his Gravity Manipulation Skill mid-motion, he hoisted the man overhead.

In one fluid motion, Guan Yu spun and slammed the bodyguard onto the corner of a pool table. A sickening *crack* echoed as two table legs snapped, tilting the surface. The bodyguard’s spine collided with the edge, leaving him writhing and gasping against the slanted table.

The brutal physics of sudden weight shifts had become Guan Yu’s signature—leveraging gravitational extremes to magnify impact. To ensure victory, he followed with a vicious side kick to the abdomen, sending both man and table sliding across the floor until they crashed into a wall. The bodyguard collapsed, moaning in a fetal position.

Feng Xin landed gracefully from her midair toss, ready to intervene, but froze as Guan Yu already stood victorious. He turned, picked up the fallen pistol, and aimed it at her.

“You…” Her flawless face paled with rage. If looks could kill, Guan Yu would’ve been flayed alive.

But the tables had turned. “Still want to stop me from dealing with this trash?” Guan Yu asked coldly, gesturing to Zhao Xu.

Feng Xin bit her lip, silent.

Ignoring her, Guan Yu strode toward Zhao Xu, who stared up in dazed horror. “Still feeling tough?” Guan Yu sneered, stomping on the man’s face before delivering a brutal kick to his nose. A wet crunch signaled shattered cartilage.

“Like forcing girls? Making them jump buildings? Real manly, targeting innocents when streetwalkers exist!” Each word punctuated by another kick, until Zhao Xu’s face became a bloody mess of broken teeth and splintered bone.

Feng Xin stiffened at Guan Yu’s words. “Rape? Forced suicide?” Her expression darkened.

When she stepped forward, Guan Yu swung the gun back. “Stay put. Since you couldn’t control your dog, I’ll leash him.”

To his surprise, Feng Xin’s murderous aura faded. Instead, something like approval flickered in her eyes—perhaps disarmed by his righteous fury.

**Chapter 60: A Beauty’s Face, A Man’s Temperament**

As Guan Yu continued pummeling Zhao Xu, Feng Xin watched calmly, head tilted. Only when he paused did she speak: “I have a question.”

“Ask.”

“Did you storm here… because he targeted your girlfriend?”

Guan Yu frowned. Was Du Xiaojuan his girlfriend? Not exactly. “A friend. But bullying girls? Pathetic.” He shot Feng Xin a derisive glance—after all, Zhao Xu was her subordinate.

“My turn.” Feng Xin strode forward.

“Freeze!” Guan Yu raised the gun.

She glared. “I’m done fighting you. Not because of that toy, but your principles. Now lower it before I change my mind.”

To his own surprise, Guan Yu complied. Without the tension, the weapon felt pointless—especially with his gravity skills as backup.

What followed stunned him: Feng Xin sprinted and delivered a soccer-style kick to Zhao Xu’s ribs, sending the man skidding. “I TOLD you all to stick to our own girls!” she roared between kicks. “Where’s your professional ethics?!”

Guan Yu gaped. Here was a refined beauty lecturing thugs on workplace morals—while assaulting them. The absurdity almost made him laugh.

“Your turn,” Feng Xin panted, leaning on a table.

Guan Yu shook his head at the semiconscious Zhao Xu. “There’s another—Wang Fubin. Where?”

“Sixth-floor lounge…” Zhao Xu slurred through broken teeth.

Tossing the gun aside, Guan Yu headed for the elevators. To his surprise, Feng Xin followed, waving off her men.

In the confined space, he finally studied her—this enigma with a porcelain doll’s face and a brawler’s soul. Her sharp phoenix eyes and delicate nose belied the ferocity within. What man could ever tame such a creature? Guan Yu doubted even his supernatural gifts could manage it.

**Chapter 61: Settling Scores Later**

The sixth-floor lounge pulsed with dim lights and thumping music. Onstage, bikini-clad dancers swayed as patrons lounged. Spotting Wang Fubin laughing on a sofa, Guan Yu grabbed his hair and dragged him backward like luggage.

Wang’s crew leapt up, the largest charging with a flying kick. Guan Yu rooted himself—when the thug’s foot connected, it met immovable force. The attacker recoiled as if hitting a steel pillar, crashing into his comrades.

Feng Xin observed from the bar, sipping a drink brought by a balding underling. The sight of middle-aged men groveling before this young woman would’ve been comical—if not for the bloodshed moments earlier.

As Guan Yu hauled Wang toward the exit, Feng Xin murmured to herself: “We’ll settle our accounts… after he’s done.”
