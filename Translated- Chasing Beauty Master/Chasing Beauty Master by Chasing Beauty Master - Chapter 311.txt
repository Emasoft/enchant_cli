“Brother Quan, there’s Edison Chen, it’s Edison Chen! Damn it, I’ll go buy lottery tickets later—whatever I pick will hit!” A sleazy-looking man with a particularly vulgar appearance exclaimed excitedly.

“Motherf*cker, this guy is way better than Brother Edison. At least Edison’s stuff was consensual, but this guy straight up broke in and forced himself on her. What a f*cking badass!” Brother Quan sighed.

“What a shame. The woman was dragged straight to the living room. We missed the juiciest part! We should’ve set up more cameras,” the sleazy man lamented.

“Brother Quan, let’s wait a bit longer. Maybe we’ll catch some X-rated action. This is hotter than watching AV stars!” The sleazy man grinned lewdly, his face full of anticipation.

Brother Quan frowned slightly, pondered for a moment, then shook his head. “Delays breed trouble! The boss is waiting for our update. Let’s send the footage now!”

“Brother Quan, the boss would definitely want to see more explosive scenes. If we capture it, he’ll be thrilled and might give us a million! We’ll strike gold!” The sleazy man insisted.

Brother Quan hesitated. He knew their boss planned to use this footage to blackmail Gao Wei. The more explicit the content, the more leverage they’d have—and the greater his cut would be. But his cautious nature made him uneasy. Finally, he shook his head. “No. Send it to the boss now!”

The sleazy man watched helplessly as Brother Quan compiled the video files and sent them to their boss. Suddenly, the door burst open.

**Chapter 786: Tracking**

“Sh*t! We’re caught!” The commotion outside startled the two men. The sleazy man panicked. “Stay calm! I’ll handle this!” Brother Quan glanced at the upload progress, smirked, and calmly closed his laptop. He stood up, feigning indignation. “Who are you? I’ll report you for harassing guests!”

His bravado meant nothing. Guan Yu charged forward, grabbed Brother Quan’s shoulders, kneed him in the gut, then elbowed his face. Brother Quan flew across the room, crashing to the floor, unconscious.

The sleazy man scrambled back but couldn’t escape a beating. Guan Yu coldly opened the laptop and paled—the video had already been sent. He turned to Brother Quan. “Who did you send the video to?”

Brother Quan spat blood. “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”

Guan Yu kicked him mercilessly. “I don’t have time for games. Tell me—who’s behind this?”

“I’ll call the police! You’re done for!” Brother Quan snarled.

Guan Yu turned to the sleazy man. “If you want to keep your manhood, talk.”

The sleazy man cracked. “It’s our boss, Zhou Hongyan! He wants to ruin Gao Wei!”

“Where is Zhou Hongyan?” Guan Yu demanded.

“I don’t know! But Brother Quan does!”

Brother Quan glared. “You’ll regret this!”

Guan Yu crushed his groin. “Men who don’t love women don’t need this.”

**Chapter 787: Leaked Video**

After resolving the immediate threat, Guan宇 sought tech genius Zhu Lin. “Can you hack the recipient’s computer and destroy the video?”

Zhu Lin smirked. “Easy. Give me five minutes.”

But the video had already been downloaded. Zhu Lin failed. “He downloaded it before I could erase it.”

Guan宇 sighed. The worst had happened.

“Zhou Hongyan has the video. We need to confront him,” Guan宇 told Gao Wei.

The next evening, they met Zhou Hongyan at the hotel. Zhou arrived late, smug. “Miss Gao, you’ll regret crossing me.”

Guan宇 stepped forward. “I’m the man in your video. Delete it.”

Zhou sneered. “Or what?”

Guan宇’s eyes turned icy. “Or I’ll expose every scandal you’ve hidden.”

Zhou paled. “You wouldn’t dare.”

Guan宇 smiled. “Try me.”

**Chapter 788: Showdown**

Zhou’s threats crumbled. Guan宇’s evidence of Zhou’s corruption forced him to delete the video. Defeated, Zhou fled, leaving Gao Wei relieved.

“It’s over,” Guan宇 said.

Gao Wei smiled. “Thank you.”

The crisis averted, they resumed their plans, climbing the mountain at dawn—a new beginning.
