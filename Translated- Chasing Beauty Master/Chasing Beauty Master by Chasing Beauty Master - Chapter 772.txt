“Oh, so these traffic police were called by Sun Xu.” Knowing he couldn’t confront Guan Yu further without escalating the situation, Sun Xu forced an ingratiating smile. “Hahaha, officers, the smashed car inside is mine. But this was all a misunderstanding—we’ve already resolved it. Could you please call a tow truck to haul it away first?”

“Damn, why drag us here if it’s settled? You think the police have nothing better to do on weekends? Playing games with us?” A portly officer at the front, his belly protruding, barked angrily.

“Officers, how could this be a game? Hahaha…” Sun Xu stammered, pulling out a wad of cash from his coat and stuffing it into the officer’s arms.

The officer’s expression instantly brightened. “Ah, well, if you’ve sorted it out yourselves, that’s fine. The tow truck will arrive shortly. Everyone, disperse now!” He then ambled over to inspect the BMW, muttering to himself, “Tsk, this car’s badly damaged. Repairs will cost a fortune.”

Guan Yu found Sun Xu’s groveling demeanor laughable. This charade was clearly Sun’s attempt to smooth things over for the day.

**Chapter 1958: New Clothes**

The officer’s face lit up with a practiced smile. “Ah, well, if you’ve resolved it yourselves, that’s best. The tow truck will be here soon. Everyone, clear out!” He shuffled to the BMW, eyeing the damage. “Heavens, this car’s wrecked. Repairs won’t come cheap.”

Guan Yu smirked at Sun Xu’s spineless act. Sun’s concessions today were a transparent bid for truce. Since the other party had backed down so thoroughly, pressing further would seem petty. Besides, dealing with Sun Xu could wait—there was no urgency.

“Fine. We’ll set today’s matter aside for now. But you attacked my people—that won’t be forgotten. We’ll settle this slowly. Do me a favor: stay here and inform the police when they arrive that everything’s resolved. I know you Sun heirs have deep pockets.”

After Guan Yu’s declaration, the crowd of students lost interest, though many admired his magnanimity. Sun Xu’s minor concessions had earned unexpected leniency.

“Disperse! Everyone, go home.” Guan Yu headed toward the gates, planning to drive back. The security team glared silently, resentment simmering beneath their compliance. All knew Guan Yu’s reputation—no one dared cross him.

“Did you hear? The principal’s scandal with female students went public. His career’s ruined—he’ll be jailed for years.”

“Yeah, and they say a new principal’s arriving soon. A school as big as Kaihuang can’t stay leaderless.”

Students chatted animatedly as they walked home.

Spotting the guards at the gate, Guan Yu approached. “Remember this: henceforth, you will not harass students, threaten them, demand favors, or bully female students. Otherwise, Du Zhao’s fate will be yours. Understood?”

His stern rebuke met only silent nods from the cowed guards.

“Guan Yu! Wait—do you have time tonight?”

As Guan Yu reached his car, a voice stopped him. He turned—*her?*

“Wang Jun? Why are you still here after school? Need something? If it’s about Xue Jing again, I can’t help.”

Wang Jun, the school’s famed beauty, typically dressed in masculine attire with cropped hair. Known for her preference for women, she’d previously pestered Guan Yu to “hand over” Xue Jing. Her motives now were unclear.

“No. I’m surprised you let Sun Xu off so easily. I expected you to thrash him.” Wang Jun had watched the entire scene, anticipating a brawl that never came. Guan Yu’s restraint puzzled her.

Lately, Wang Jun had investigated Guan Yu extensively but found little beyond his shared name with Huayu Group’s chairman. She’d briefly wondered if they were the same person but dismissed it due to his youth.

“It’s nothing. He’s not worth the effort yet.” Guan Yu’s excuse masked practicality—with police en route, starting a fight would complicate matters, even if he feared no consequences.

“Free for dinner?” Wang Jun blurted.

“Dinner? No need for formalities. State your business—as long as it’s not about Xue Jing, I’ll help.”

“Won’t you grant me this face?”

“Don’t misunderstand. I’ve promised to dine with someone at home.”

“Am I not a woman?” Wang Jun retorted, hands on hips.

True—Wang Jun was undeniably beautiful, though she’d always referred to herself as “本少爷” (this young master), rejecting femininity. Today’s shift baffled Guan Yu. Normally, calling her a “woman” invited violence—especially given her cultivation skills.

Guan Yu scratched his head awkwardly. “It’s not about face-keeping. I gave my word. How about another day?”

“Fine. Remember—you owe me a meal. Tomorrow, I’ll find Wei Hongwei. I’m joining Yu Gang.” With that, Wang Jun strode off without a backward glance.

Guan Yu stood perplexed. A few words had cost him a meal—and now he owed her one. Wang Jun’s behavior defied her notorious aversion to men. Why engage him so warmly?

*Could she… like me?* Guan Yu mused. He *had* called A’Mei earlier, confirming dinner plans.

At home, A’Mei had prepared a lavish spread. After the trio ate their fill, she shyly presented Guan Yu with a new T-shirt. “I saw this while shopping… thought it’d suit you.”

The white V-neck shirt bore a stark black skull design. Guan Yu grinned, stripping off his shirt to reveal toned muscles—a familiar sight to A’Mei and Xue Jing.

“Fits perfectly. Your taste’s impeccable, A’Mei. Love it.” He stood, admiring the fit.

“Glad you like it. I worried about the size.”

“Thanks, A’Mei.”

“No need for formalities!”

As A’Mei headed to wash dishes, Xue Jing descended, eyeing Guan Yu’s new look. “Not bad. Looks cool.”

“Of course! A’Mei picked it. Unlike someone who drags me along for sizing.” Guan Yu teased, chin raised.

“Look at this spendthrift! Shouldn’t buy you anything. Since A’Mei arrived, you’ve barely touched me—rolling in her bed daily. Now she knows every inch of you. No wonder it fits!”

**Chapter 1959: I’m a Man**

Xue Jing’s face flushed crimson as she berated Guan Yu, who bore it meekly. Her acceptance of A’Mei was mercy enough.

“A’Mei, why buy him clothes? The handsomer he gets, the more girls he’ll chase. You’re asking for trouble.” Xue Jing chided.

A’Mei merely smiled.

Next morning, before classes, Wang Jun stormed into Wei Hongwei’s classroom, stunning everyone. Gone was her tomboyish look—replaced by a yellow cap-sleeve top, black pleated skirt, and red flats. Though still short-haired, her makeup accentuated long lashes and crimson lips, radiating allure.

“Holy hell! Who’s that beauty? Since when…?” Wei Hongwei gaped.

“Wei-ge, enroll me in Yu Gang.” Wang Jun slapped her ID on his desk.

Eager to recruit such a stunner, Wei Hongwei fawned: “Welcome! Yu Gang life’s vibrant—”

“Less chatter. Hurry up.”

After registering, Wei Hongwei froze—the ID read *Wang Jun*. Had she… transitioned? No—she’d simply embraced her femininity. The class buzzed: Was Kaihuang’s dynasty shifting?

Guan Yu watched warily. Approaching him, Wang Jun purred: “Guan Yu, I’m yours now. Take good care of me.”

The room collectively short-circuited. *Did she just—?*

Baffled, Guan Yu chuckled: “Wang-gongzi, I’m… lost.”

“Don’t call me ‘young master.’ Call me Jun’er.”

The class shuddered—her saccharine tone chilling the air.

“Hah, Wang-gongzi, quit the act. I know you prefer that title.” Guan Yu suppressed goosebumps.

Wang Jun smirked, settling onto his lap. “Starting today, I’ll be a woman—*your* woman.”

The bombshell detonated. Campus forums exploded.

Even Lü Mei, once pursued by Wang Jun, stared in disbelief. This wasn’t the Wang Jun they knew.

Her slender finger tilted Guan Yu’s chin, their proximity unsettling him. “Stop joking. I’m a man.”

“Everyone knows that. Hence, I’ll be your woman.” Her velvety voice could melt any man.

“Then prove it. I’d love to see you in feminine attire—you’d shine. Remember telling me that? I never forgot.”

“You misunderstood. If this continues, I’ll… react.” Guan Yu shifted uncomfortably.

“Giggle! Wouldn’t embarrass my man publicly. Class is starting—later.” Wang Jun sauntered out, leaving a stupefied crowd.

Within minutes, 80% of students were disseminating the scandalous update.

Lü Mei studied Guan Yu quizzically. “Checking if the man who changed Wang Jun’s orientation has flowers on his face.”

Guan Yu sighed. *This is peach-blossom luck? One comment altering someone’s preferences? Unreal.*

**Chapter 1960: Younger Brother**

At noon, Wang Jun intercepted Guan Yu and Wei Hongwei. “You owe me a meal. No time like the present.”

Her transformation—now undeniably feminine—left classmates reeling. Even Wei Hongwei’s stolen glances earned a kick. “Peep again, and I’ll gouge your eyes!”

Beneath the charm, Wang Jun’s ferocity remained.

Honoring his debt, Guan Yu led them to a nearby restaurant. Wei Hongwei ordered gluttonously, amusing Wang Jun. “He’s ordered enough for four!”

Guan Yu laughed. “That’s just his portion.”

As Wang Jun raised her drink in toast, a magnetic voice interrupted: “Guan Yu?”

Turning, he saw a woman resembling Wang Jun—her elder sister, renowned even beyond Kaihuang for being Wang Jun’s closest confidante.
