“Uncle, I’m here! Haha, are you leaving?” Zhang Han popped out and exclaimed.

Guanyu gently stroked Zhang Han’s hair and said, “Yes, let’s go. I’ll take you out for a stroll.” Turning to Yang Cheng, he added, “Let Zhang Han stay with me for a few days. I’ll ensure her safety.”

Yang Cheng nodded in relief. With Guanyu’s protection, Zhang Han’s safety was assured—this much he trusted.

Zhang Han was the Yang family’s golden vault. If the secret hidden within her could ever be uncovered, the Yang family would surpass the glory once held by the Jin family and rise to the pinnacle of noble clans, wielding unimaginable wealth and influence.

This was why the Yang family doted on Zhang Han so excessively—they had yet to extract what they desired from her. Guanyu recalled how Zhang Han’s mother, in a moment of crisis, had sealed certain memories within her daughter’s mind using an extraordinary method, reinforced by a powerful seal.

Guanyu’s current task was to examine Zhang Han’s body and uncover its hidden secrets.

After leaving the Yang residence, he took her to a mall to buy snacks before heading to Yang Conghan’s villa. “Hanhan,” Guanyu asked solemnly, “I need to ask you a few questions. You must answer me truthfully.”

“What questions? Go ahead,” Zhang Han replied nonchalantly, emptying her newly purchased snacks onto the coffee table and nibbling through them.

“Do you remember who your birth parents were?” Guanyu pressed earnestly.

“No. Granduncle said they were killed by villains.”

So Yang Cheng had fed her that lie. Guanyu continued, “Then you remember nothing from your childhood?” Zhang Han nodded. “Right. My earliest memories are of growing up under Auntie’s care.”

Guanyu suddenly felt a pang of pity for the girl. Orphaned at a young age, raised without parental love, and nurtured by the very enemies who had destroyed her clan. Though the Yang family showered her with affection, it was superficial—a far cry from genuine care.

“Hanhan, I need to examine your body. But you mustn’t tell anyone—this will be our secret, alright?” Guanyu spoke softly.

“You want to examine me too? Granduncle often checks my body,” Zhang Han remarked curiously. Guanyu’s interest sharpened—Yang Cheng had clearly tried and failed for years, suggesting the seal in her mind was formidable.

“Give me your hand.” Guanyu closed his eyes as a wisp of his inner energy flowed through her palm into her body.

He searched tirelessly for the legendary seal but found no trace. Instead, he discovered an astonishingly powerful reservoir of energy within her, its density beyond comprehension. Yet this immense power contradicted her outward capabilities.

As Guanyu’s energy reached her brain, Zhang Han’s inner force coalesced violently, repelling his intrusion.

“Self-protection?” Guanyu murmured, opening his eyes to find her still snacking obliviously. The energy operated independently, activating only in perceived danger.

The force was too potent to confront directly without harming her. Knowing the seal likely resided in her fragile brain, Guanyu withdrew. “Hanhan, does Yang Cheng always inspect you this way?”

“Mhm. But he presses his hand on my head, not holding hands like you. Once it hurt so much I fainted. Another time, he even coughed up blood!”

Had Yang Cheng been repelled by the seal’s backlash? Guanyu pondered. Even if Yang Cheng succeeded in breaking the seal, it might reveal childhood memories—including how the four great clans annihilated the Zhang family. Should Zhang Han learn the Yangs were her clan’s destroyers, she’d never divulge any treasure-related memories, rendering Yang Cheng’s efforts futile. Would they resort to torture then?

Jinhua likely knew of the seal too but lacked the cultivation to bypass it. Now discovered, she’d gone into hiding from the Yangs’ vast network.

Meanwhile, after Guanyu’s departure, Yang Cheng reported to Patriarch Yang: “Father, Guanyu took Zhang Han.”

The patriarch, resuming his interrupted chess game with Yang Conghan, mused, “No matter. She’s safe with him. He remains unaware of the truth.”

Yang Cheng nodded. “I attempted to breach the seal again last night but failed. That energy disperses if approached indirectly. We’ve exhausted every method over the years.”

“Patience,” the patriarch advised. “So long as she remains ours, that treasure stays hidden from all. Time is our ally.”

Yang Conghan interjected, “Guanyu seems omnipotent. Should we enlist his help under pretense?”

“No,” the patriarch否决. “This secret must never escape. Find Jinhua—she mustn’t meet Zhang Han again.”

After Yang Cheng left, Yang Conghan questioned, “Grandfather, as our sworn kin and Father’s savior, won’t Guanyu eventually learn the truth?”

“Not yet. Fewer knowers mean safer for us. Should rival clans discover a Zhang survivor here, they’d unite against us.”

Unbeknownst to all, years prior, the patriarch and Yang Cheng had jointly attempted to shatter the seal. The backlash cost Yang Cheng his cultivation and nearly his life, saved only by the patriarch transferring his lifelong功力. The “走火入魔” story told to Yang Conghan was a cover—their failure had actually strengthened the seal’s protective energy by absorbing Yang Cheng’s power.

Later, Guanyu brought Zhang Han to Qiaoyuan District’s Xue Jing villa, warning Wei Hongwei at Kaihuang Academy about Sun Xu’s potential revenge, then visiting the Huaye Club—intentionally signaling Zhang Han’s whereabouts, hoping to lure Jinhua out.

That night, after Zhang Han finally slept, Guanyu confided everything to Xue Jing. “Before your amnesia,” she revealed, “you’d heard of memory-sealing techniques. I believe your own memories are similarly locked.”

“But you told me my amnesia came from a car accident!” Guanyu exclaimed.

Xue Jing regretted her slip—Guanyu’s true condition involved a seal imprisoning both memories and most cultivation, his latent energy subconsciously guarding it.

“You were once a Boundary Sovereign,” Xue Jing confessed, narrating his past glory, their Arctic expedition against demonic forces, and the mysterious energy that erased his past.

The next morning, finding a damp shoebox in the courtyard, Guanyu discovered a note: “West Willow Village, 50 li west.—J.”

Assuming Jinhua’s summons, he raced westward. Reaching West Willow Village, he asked a local, “Is this West Willow Village?”

“Yes,” the villager confirmed.

**Chapter 1973: False Alarm**

Parking his motorcycle, Guanyu surveyed the rural landscape, every sense alert for ambush. Yet the village breathed tranquility—chickens pecking, farmers tending fields. No sign of tension.

Approaching a weathered shrine, he spotted a figure in tattered robes—Jinhua! Her face bore fresh bruises, eyes frantic. “You came! They’re after me—”

A gunshot cracked. Jinhua collapsed, blood blossoming on her chest. From the shadows emerged Yang Cheng’s men, rifles smoking. “Trap!” Guanyu realized too late as more figures surrounded him.
