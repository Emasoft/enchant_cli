After Junniu returned, he found himself in a dilemma. On one side was Guanyu, whom the boss had specifically instructed not to offend. On the other was a wealthy "star second-generation" heir—both were figures he couldn’t afford to cross. Now, he had no idea how to resolve this, but he knew he had to find a way to usher these two troublesome guests out.

Just as Junniu was racking his brain, the police arrived. He suddenly had an idea. Before the officers could come upstairs, he hurried down to greet them.

Spotting the lead officer, Junniu approached and said, “Officer, the commotion upstairs has disrupted my business for quite some time. I hope you can take those troublemakers away for investigation. Do me this favor, or my losses will be substantial.”

As he spoke, Junniu discreetly slipped several banknotes into the officer’s hand. The officer’s eyes flickered before he chuckled, “Don’t worry. We serve the people. Such a large establishment can’t afford halted business. I’ll go upstairs and take them away immediately.”

“Thank you, Officer. This way, please…” Junniu smiled with satisfaction, relieved the man understood the situation.

When the officers reached the second floor, the lead policeman surveyed the scene and demanded, “Who’s causing trouble here? Come with us now.”

The man in the black tank top recognized the lead officer. Delighted, he rushed forward and said, “Officer Yu! This man assaulted my friend, who’s now severely injured and hospitalized. And this woman—they’re together. Arrest them!”

Officer Yu glanced at the black-clad man. He knew him well—the man’s father had often sought his “assistance,” lining his pockets generously over the years. Such a lucrative connection wasn’t one to jeopardize.

Snarling at Guanyu, Officer Yu barked, “Assaulting people so brazenly? Have you no fear of the law? Take this man and woman into custody!”

At his command, four or five officers moved to handcuff Guanyu and Xue Jing. Guanyu seethed at these corrupt enforcers who acted without inquiry—typical of the rot plaguing the nation. The powerful trampled the weak, the rich bought justice—this was the unspoken rule.

On the fishing arcade machine, Guanyu’s ammunition count had neared four thousand, but he had no mind to continue. As the officers approached, he suddenly stood and gripped Xue Jing’s wrist, sensing her readiness to strike. He had no desire to complicate matters over these pawns.

“Stand back. We’ll walk on our own,” Guanyu said coolly, waving them off.

The black tank top man smirked inwardly. *All bark and no bite. Cowers at the sight of police. How dull. But that little beauty makes tonight worthwhile.*

**Chapter 2736: Avenging My Friend**

Officer Yu initially wanted his men to cuff the pair, but Junniu shot him a meaningful look—*just get them out, no need for theatrics.*

“Good. You’re sensible. Move it,” Officer Yu gruffed.

Guanyu remained silent, leading Xue Jing downstairs. Passing Junniu on the stairway, he smiled, “Tell Boss Ma to keep my remaining credits on the fishing machine. I’ll return to finish another day.”

Junniu didn’t respond, unnerved by Guanyu’s grin—more chilling than a ghoul’s mask.

As officers herded them out, the black tank top man trailed behind, planning to give a “statement” at the station—and claim his prize afterward.

“Pretty boy,” he jeered, “you won’t be coming back. Once you’re in the system, I’ll make sure you rot there for years!”

Guanyu ignored him, exiting the casino. Junniu exhaled in relief—the jinxes were finally gone.

Just as Guanyu neared the police van, two Wujiang microvans screeched to a halt. Over a dozen thugs wielding weapons poured out, storming toward them.

Guanyu instantly recognized the black tank top’s triumphant sneer—these were his called reinforcements.

“You waited hours for this pathetic squad? Embarrassing,” Guanyu taunted.

The man bristled at the insult. *Too easy sending him to jail. Let’s beat him senseless first.*

“Still arrogant with my men here? Where’s your courage?” he spat.

“Courage? Look at your rabble. This is a joke,” Guanyu retorted.

Pulling Officer Yu aside, the man whispered, “Let me teach him a lesson first. For my friend.”

Officer Yu hesitated—this was blatant illegality. But the man’s wealthy father held too much sway.

“Keep it quiet. No fatalities,” Yu relented.

The man grinned. “You’ll be rewarded.”

Guanyu observed their collusion unperturbed. These thugs were no match for Xue Jing’s skills.

“Come here, pretty boy!” the man mocked. “Fight my men fair—no help from your girl.”

Guanyu ignored him, turning toward the van. “We’re leaving.”

Enraged, the man screamed, “Coward! Attack!”

As the mob charged, a black unmarked car roared in. Two suited men leapt out, brandishing Type 54 pistols.

**Chapter 2737: Pissing Pants**

Gunfire erupted. Guanyu shoved Xue Jing into the van, diving in as bullets pinged the doors. The police vehicle’s thick metal withstood the barrage, but windows shattered.

The black tank top man stood frozen, urine darkening his pants. His thugs lay bleeding—some hit directly, others by ricochets.

Officer Yu and his squad cowered behind cover, paralyzed. The assassins—sent by Poison Widow—reloaded, advancing.

Guanyu peered out. One gunman’s shoulder exploded under his Desert Eagle’s roar. The shooters ducked behind their car.

Stalemate.

**Chapter 2738: No Hesitation**

Guanyu considered blowing the fuel tank but opted against the spectacle. The black-clad man trembled, realizing this was no game.

Poison Widow’s men had missed their chance. Now cornered, they hid as Guanyu’s golden Desert Eagle gleamed—a sight that made Officer Yu soil himself.

Bullets spent, the assassins hesitated. Guanyu’s shot had crippled one. The other crouched, trapped.

Around them, the casino’s neon flickered over the carnage—a tableau of corruption meeting its match.
