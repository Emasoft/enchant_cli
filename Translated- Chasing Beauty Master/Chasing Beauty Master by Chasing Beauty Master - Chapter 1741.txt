At this moment, Guan Yu's greatest worry was whether everyone could endure after the enormous tornado passed. Only two outcomes existed.

Either everyone would emerge unscathed... or all would be swept into the whirlwind's maw, leaving not a single intact corpse behind.

A vivid image flashed through Guan Yu's mind—if he weighed over a thousand pounds instead of a mere hundred, perhaps the tornado couldn't lift him even if it struck. With nearly twenty people chained together by ropes, as long as they maintained their grip and kept their protective barriers intact, they might survive this calamity. Even if someone were momentarily lifted, holding the line could preserve them all.

His hand tightened on the rope before suddenly releasing to grasp Siqi's trembling fingers. The biting gale seemed to soften as her cold palm met his warm clasp—a fleeting anchor of safety in the chaos. Words became useless against the thunderous roars overhead; communication now flowed through touch alone. Guan Yu patted her hand twice, mentally projecting: *"Don't fear, Siqi. I'm here. We'll endure."*

Her fingers twitched in response. Nearby, Wang Jun devised a solution to their dire predicament—securing themselves with belts lashed to the ropes. The terror-stricken disciples quickly emulated him, including Guan Yu who used Siqi's leather coat instead for extra security. Though prepared, tension hung thicker than the storm clouds as survival balanced on knife's edge.

In desperation, Guan Yu attempted meditative cultivation. Unexpectedly, his soul consciousness separated from his body, floating above like a detached observer. Below, his physical form sat motionless while others fidgeted nervously. Through this aerial vantage, he spotted Xiaomei and her sister transforming into snakes to burrow beneath sand-filled rainwater—their survival method starkly contrasting the humans' struggle.

Nearby camels fought their tethers, one straining until its neck bled crimson against restraining ropes. Guan Yu's spectral form ached to aid them but found himself powerless—a disembodied soul capable only of speech. Within the Emperor's Seal artifact space, its resident spirit confirmed his limitations: *"You're merely a consciousness now. No combat, only observation."*

As the tornado subsided to manageable winds, Guan Yu returned to his body. Sixteen disciples remained—two lay exhausted in torn garments, their spiritual energy depleted. Erecting a protective dome with Luohun Blade, Guan Yu channeled energy into the fallen while Siqi stirred beside him.

*"Is...is it over?"* she whispered, observing lightening skies.

*"The worst has passed,"* he affirmed, though the desert now bore scars of their trial—scattered camel remains, uprooted tents, and sand stained with struggle. Those who endured wore the hollow-eyed look of men who'd stared into oblivion...and lived to blink.

The belt-securing tactic proved vital when the tornado's fury peaked. Wang Jun's innovation allowed disciples to conserve strength, though weaker members still verged on collapse. Guan Yu's aerial spirit witnessed Xiaomei's subterranean refuge and camels' desperate thrashing—one beast's neck furrows deepening to bloody gasps against unyielding ropes.

**Chapter 4555: Temporary Shelter**

Within the Emperor's Seal, the artifact spirit's millennia of wisdom offered cold comfort: *"Nature's whims care nothing for mortal struggles."* Guan Yu lingered in this soul sanctuary, avoiding the heart-wrenching spectacle of comrades in peril. Only when winds dwindled did he return, finding two disciples hypothermic but alive—their survival a testament to human tenacity.

**Chapter 4556: Survival's Aftermath**

Post-storm revelations showed cultivation hierarchies laid bare—the strongest maintained faint protective auras while weaker brethren lay prostrate. Guan Yu's restorative energies reignited their fading life sparks as dawn's light pierced retreating clouds. Though battered, the group emerged fundamentally unchanged: sixteen survivors, bonds tested but unbroken, facing the desert's next trial with hard-won resilience.
