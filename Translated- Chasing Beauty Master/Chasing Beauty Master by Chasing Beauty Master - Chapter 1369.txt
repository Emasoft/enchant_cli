Xi Liu thought to herself that perhaps the Left Envoy had merely been spouting nonsense to intimidate them. If one could truly fly across using flight techniques, she would be the first to reach Patriarch Menghua’s underground palace. Wouldn’t the Eight-Sided Drum technique then belong solely to her? Even if it meant taking risks, Xi Liu had to try.

“Wait here. If I cross safely, follow immediately,” Xi Liu declared, activating her flight technique to drift slowly into the air, advancing cautiously.

Her movements were deliberate, her pace measured to avoid alerting the ferocious beast in the lake.

Guan Yu curiously asked, “Xiao Rong, do you know what Xi Liu’s magical artifact is? I’ve never seen her use it.”

“I don’t either. As one of the renowned Demon King Sisters, she must possess one, but its nature remains unknown to me.” Wang Xiaorong then added, “Guan Yu, do you think Sister Xi Liu will succeed?”

“Of course not. She underestimates the beast’s power. If this creature is truly the transformed divine beast of legend, it has cultivated for millennia. Such a being could easily thwart her.”

Guan Yu continued, “Besides, if crossing were so simple, the Left Envoy would have acted long ago. Why wait until now?”

As Xi Liu risked her life, the members of the Strange Demon Cave wore complex expressions, uncertain whether she would reach the lake’s center.

**Chapter 3545: Child’s Play**

Guan Yu noted Xi Liu’s exceptional mastery of flight—her hovering form remained as steady as a suspended object, a testament to her centuries of cultivation.

Among the Strange Demon Cave crowd, Guan Yu spotted Cui Hua. The girl stared intently at Xi Liu’s figure, her worry palpable. Guan Yu held some fondness for this earnest young disciple.

The others moved with equal care, anxious not to disrupt Xi Liu’s progress.

The Left Envoy commanded, “Tend to the wounded and retreat further. When that beast awakens, it won’t be child’s play.”

The Demonic Soul Sect members withdrew to higher ground. The Left Envoy reasoned that distance from the lake would spare them the beast’s wrath if provoked.

Wang Xiaorong whispered, “Could the lake truly still house such a beast? Wouldn’t it have died by now? Why wasn’t it disturbed during the earlier battle?”

“Not necessarily. Cultivators live millennia—how much more a divine beast? Especially a tortoise, whose longevity thrives in suitable environments.”

Nodding, Wang Xiaorong conceded, “Then Sister Xi Liu likely won’t make it. I’m growing concerned for her.”

Guan Yu grumbled, “Worry about us instead! You fret over the Left Envoy one moment, Xi Liu the next. Whose side are you on?”

“I side with peace. As fellow demonic practitioners, why must they slaughter each other?”

Though slow, Xi Liu had now fully entered the lake’s airspace. The waters lay mirror-still, their clarity obscured by darkness.

Steward Sun murmured to the Left Envoy, “Could your information be wrong? No beast has appeared.”

“Impossible. This came from the Demon Lord himself.” The Left Envoy frowned. “Perhaps she hasn’t reached its territory. Or the beast perished over the millennia.”

“Unlikely. Divine beasts don’t die easily. Maybe her method avoids provocation.”

As he spoke, concentric ripples suddenly marred the lake’s surface—as if a stone had been cast.

Xi Liu tensed but pressed on. Having traversed fifty meters, she remained distant from the center. Flying high with limited visibility, she failed to notice the water’s transformation.

“Look!” A white-fox demon pointed. “The lake stirs—is that wind?” Indeed, a breeze now brushed everyone’s faces.

“Disaster approaches! Recall Sister Liu!” Cui Hua cried, torn between tending wounded and watching Xi Liu.

Xi Taohua rushed shoreward, but the Left Envoy blocked her path. “Silence! Shouting may enrage the beast further.”

Chaos mounted as the wind strengthened. Guan Yu pulled Wang Xiaorong backward. “We must retreat to higher ground!”

Xiao Zhi demanded, “What’s happening?” as they regrouped.

“A lake beast awakened by Xi Liu’s passage. We need distance.” Guan Yu mimicked the Left Envoy’s caution.

Midflight, Xi Liu finally noticed the churning waves. Wheeling back, she found her return obstructed—the headwind defied her flight arts despite favorable currents.

Panic set in. The Left Envoy’s warnings proved true—she’d trespassed on the beast’s domain.

A vortex yawned beneath her, its suction overpowering. Xi Taohua soared to aid her sister. “Combine our strength!”

The sisters embraced, straining against the maelstrom. Yet despite their efforts, the vortex’s pull dragged them backward.

“If sucked in, the impact will shatter them,” Guan Yu observed from his rocky vantage.

Wang Xiaorong pleaded, “Shouldn’t we help?”

“With what power?” Guan Yu snapped. “Even the Demon Lord would rejoice at their demise.”

The Left Envoy privately regretted not luring the entire Strange Demon Cave into this trap earlier.

As gale-force winds lifted pebbles, the sisters’ forms contorted. Xi Taohua shouted inspiration: “Attack the vortex’s heart! The beast must be below!”

Abandoning resistance, they channeled their ultimate joint technique—the Demon King Art. Crimson energy coalesced around them, its aura shaking distant observers.

“I underestimated them,” the Left Envoy admitted as the blood-red sphere struck the vortex.

The cataclysmic impact quaked the earth. Though the vortex momentarily dispersed, it reformed larger than before. Multiple whirlpools now dotted the lake, their combined suction threatening the shore.

“We must evacuate!” Steward Sun urged. “The mountain could collapse!”

As the Left Envoy nodded, a desperate cry echoed: “Sister!”

Xi Taohua, realizing their doom, dissolved into vital energy and plunged into the vortex. “Lead our sisters to safety!”

The sacrificial detonation briefly weakened the maelstrom. Stunned, Xi Liu hovered over the raging waters—her sister gone, their quest suddenly meaningless.

Memories flooded her: the obsessive pursuit of the Eight-Sided Drum technique, the fallen disciples, now Xi Taohua’s final act. Her sister’s stern exterior had concealed deep loyalty.

“Take them home...” The fading words anchored Xi Liu’s resolve. This costly ambition—to challenge the Demon Lord—had cost too much. Grief crystallized into purpose as the vortex renewed its fury.

**Chapter 3546: Inadequate**

The reformed maelstrom dwarfed its predecessor. Xi Liu stared at the devouring spiral, her sister’s essence mingling with the froth. What remained but to honor that sacrifice?
