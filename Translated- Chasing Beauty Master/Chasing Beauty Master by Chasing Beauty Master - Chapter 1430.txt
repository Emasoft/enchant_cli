“Seeing his second and youngest brothers captured, Boss Pan had no choice but to shout, ‘Third Brother, stop fighting!’

He then glanced at Constable Han and said, ‘We admit defeat today. Constable Han, was it? There will be other days. You’d best not walk alone at night from now on. Take this gold—it should suffice as compensation for the damages. Now release my brothers.’

Constable Han eagerly grabbed the heavy money pouch, his face glowing with satisfaction as he weighed it. Smirking, he said, ‘I’ll accept this compensation on behalf of the innkeeper. But this hardly covers the costs. Mobilizing government troops isn’t done lightly. While this might cover the inn’s losses, what about my soldiers’ efforts? And the injuries your men caused—how do we account for that?’

‘Ridiculous!’ Boss Pan roared, his face flushed with anger. ‘The gold I gave you is more than enough! Are you, a government official, trying to extort me?’ He no longer cared about the gold—there was plenty more in the mountains. His brothers’ safety was his only concern.

‘Enough talk!’ Third Master snapped, pointing at Constable Han with a commanding tone. ‘Take the money and release them now!’

With hostages in hand, Constable Han felt no urgency. He relished their desperation. ‘You caused this disturbance. As law enforcers, we can’t let you off easily.’ He sneered inwardly—taking their money wasn’t enough. If word spread, it would tarnish the government’s reputation.

‘Moreover,’ he added, ‘letting you walk free would invite future trouble. This gold merely covers the inn’s losses. You must all return with me to face judgment according to the law.’

‘To hell with your laws!’ Eyebrow Scar, pinned to the ground, bellowed. ‘If you don’t release us, our hundreds of men on Horse Mountain will raze your pathetic yamen to the ground! Consider this your warning!’

‘Horse Mountain bandits, eh?’ Constable Han glared. ‘Perfect timing. We’ve been planning to eradicate your kind. Once we wipe you all out, let’s see what boasts you’ll have left!’

‘Aiyo! It hurts!’ A sudden cry drew everyone’s attention. The young bandit pinned to the ground had a bloody gash on his neck from an overzealous soldier’s blade.

Boss Pan’s eyes bulged with rage. ‘You damned curs! I’ll slaughter every last one of you for harming my brother!’ He and Third Master lunged at the soldiers restraining the youth.

Constable Han scrambled backward, shouting, ‘Capture them all! Don’t let a single one escape!’

The innkeeper and staff fled behind him as chaos erupted. Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong easily repelled the clumsy soldiers—Guan Yu kicking assailants in the gut while Wang Xiaorong aimed lower, leaving men writhing in agony.

Ah Zu, initially compliant, seized the confusion to knock out a guard and flee with his wife. Two bystanders trapped upstairs cowered as soldiers attacked indiscriminately.

Unnoticed, Constable Han and the innkeeper slipped outside. ‘Retreat and prepare archers!’ Han bellowed.

Miraculously, ‘injured’ soldiers sprang up and fled. Within moments, only a few truly incapacitated men remained.

‘Surrender now or face a hail of arrows!’ Han shouted from outside.

Ignoring the threat, Boss Pan rushed to his youngest brother. ‘It’s just a scratch. You’ll be fine. Big Brother’s here.’

‘But I’m bleeding! Am I dying?’

‘Nowhere near your heart. You’ll live,’ Boss Pan reassured.

Ah Zu tried dragging his wife out, fearing the impending arrow storm. When no one emerged, Han roared, ‘Uninvolved women may exit safely! Others will be shot!’

‘Uninvolved women?’ Guan Yu chuckled dryly. ‘Am I included?’ Besides Wang Xiaorong and Ah Zu’s wife, no other women remained.

Wang Xiaorong tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. ‘Let’s leave. Why wait for arrows?’

Guan Yu shook his head. ‘That corrupt official won’t let us go. You’d end up in his clutches, and I’d face torture. That veil can’t hide your beauty—it’s a curse.’

Wang Xiaorong smiled, pleased by his backhanded compliment. ‘What about the others upstairs? Surely he won’t—’

‘They’d rather kill innocents than risk escapees. Standard procedure,’ Guan Yu interrupted.

When no one surrendered, Han howled, ‘You brought this on yourselves! Archers—fire!’

As arrows whistled through windows, Boss Pan shielded his brothers with an overturned table. Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong dodged effortlessly until she conjured a smoky black barrier.

‘Demon Soul Sect magic?’ Guan Yu asked. ‘How long can you maintain this?’

‘Longer than their quivers last,’ she smirked.

A thunderous crash outside silenced the arrows. Peering through the window, Wang Xiaorong gasped, ‘The archers are down!’

Emerging, they found soldiers groaning on the ground. Constable Han, disheveled, cursed, ‘You’ll pay for attacking officials!’

Wang Xiaorong spotted a familiar figure. ‘Left Envoy?’

The man nodded discreetly. After dispersing the crowd, they retreated to a teahouse.

‘Why are you here?’ Wang Xiaorong demanded. ‘Did you find Desert City?’

Left Envoy glanced at Guan Yu. ‘The Demon Lord orders your return. It’s too dangerous.’

‘No! Father agreed to let me travel!’

‘The Demon Command Token says otherwise.’ He placed a triangular silver insignia on the table—the absolute authority of the Demon Soul Sect.

Wang Xiaorong stamped her foot. ‘Old Sun’s death in quicksand doesn’t mean I’ll—’

‘The Demon Lord won’t risk losing you,’ Left Envoy insisted. ‘Come home.’

‘Never! Guan Yu protects me!’

Left Envoy’s expression hardened. ‘Don’t force me to use the Token’s authority.’

Their standoff continued as Guan Yu observed silently, knowing this confrontation was far from over.”
