The first few kicks had left Qian Tong’s face even more disfigured than a pig’s head. Guan Yu felt he had restored dignity to swinekind and ceased battering the man’s face, redirecting his attention to the chest instead.

Feng Xin stood silently at the doorway, her expression impassive though a flicker of confusion danced in her eyes.

Why did she remain outside? The sight of naked men would offend her maidenly sensibilities. This was Guan Yu’s vendetta—let him enjoy his sport.

A subordinate suddenly approached, whispering urgently in Feng Xin’s ear. She nodded dismissal before turning to observe Guan Yu’s violent ballet. “Your guest has arrived,” she announced.

“Perfect timing,” Guan Yu replied, flexing his ankle. “My foot’s sore from kicking. Time for intermission.”

Qian Tong seethed silently beneath the barrage. The bastard complained of foot pain while using him as a kicking post!

“Don’t glare so,” Guan Yu taunted, glancing at the venomous stare. “I’ve brought you comfort.”

Confusion flashed across Qian Tong’s battered features until two men dragged in a new prisoner. The captive’s crimson-glazed hair was the only recognizable feature—his swollen face made Qian Tong’s injuries seem mild by comparison. A perverse comfort bloomed: at least Guan Yu had shown him mercy.

Little did he know this mercy was but prelude to greater torment.

Guan Yu nudged the lifeless form of Zhong Liang with his toe. “Know him?”

Qian Tong shook his head, throwing Zhong Liang a warning glance. But he’d forgotten his earlier insults—

*Thud!* Another kick landed. “Wrong answer,” Guan Yu growled. “Truth or pain—choose.”

Realizing confession changed nothing, Qian Tong embraced stoic silence.

Turning to Zhong Liang, Guan Yu offered clemency: “Name your employer. Truth earns freedom.”

Zhong Liang recalled Qian Tong’s murderous glare. The crime lord’s reputation for familial retaliation froze his tongue. “Kill me and be done!” he spat through broken teeth.

“Brave martyr shielding your master?” Guan Yu sneered.

Suddenly Zhong Liang lunged for the gun. Guan Yu pivoted, his kick sending the assailant crashing into furniture. Snatching a fruit knife, Zhong Liang made suicidal charge—only to be disarmed and hammered with a gut-punch that launched him across the room.

Instead of renewing attack, Zhong Liang locked eyes with Qian Tong... then drew the blade across his own throat. Crimson arcs painted the walls as he collapsed, gurgling his last.

Guan Yu’s probing mind extracted the truth: Zhong Liang’s family had been threatened. “You killed him,” he accused Qian Tong.

The crime lord’s laugh emerged as death rattle. “Hypocrite! You broke him. Finish me or stop prattling.”

Guan Yu’s smile chilled the air. “Death comes... but not swiftly.”

Feng Xin interjected: “Give me an hour. I’ll extract answers.”

“Unladylike work,” Guan Yu declined. “This requires... artistry.”

Chapter 548: Tarnished Image

Qian Tong’s blood froze at Guan Yu’s feral grin. While the pair bantered, he inched toward a hidden pistol—only to scream as a black serpent struck his wrist. Paralysis spread as the viper coiled around his naked form.

“Frustrating, isn’t it?” Guan Yu purred. “Almost had me.”

The crime lord’s eyes darted between tormentor and serpent. Guan Yu continued: “Answer well, die clean. Resist...” The snake struck again.

Chapter 549: Living Death

Qian Tong’s mind raced—how did Guan Yu know his thoughts about Wan Qianshan’s schemes? The viper’s third bite brought agonizing clarity: his body burned while mind stayed cruelly alert.

“Why does Wan Qianshan want me dead?” Guan Yu pressed.

Paralyzed vocal cords denied response. The snake struck.

“Ah, my oversight,” Guan Yu mocked. “But rules are rules.”

As reptilian fangs administered poetic justice, Guan Yu gleaned mental fragments—Wan Qianshan saw him as threat to N City machinations. Yet deeper secrets remained buried.

Settling into a chair, Guan Yu delivered final judgment: “Last question. Who else dances to Wan’s tune?”

The serpent’s embrace tightened as Qian Tong’s eyes screamed answers only agony could translate.
