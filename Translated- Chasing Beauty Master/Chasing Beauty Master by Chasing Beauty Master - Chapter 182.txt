“Because of my medical skills,” Guan Yu grinned, revealing a row of pearly white teeth.

Liao Tong’s face burned with humiliation. Guan Yu’s words were a blatant slap to their pride, mocking their inferior abilities.

“Isn’t it a bit early for lunch?” Guan Yu glanced at the time.

“No worries. That club offers spa services besides dining,” Lin Lin replied with a sly smile.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. This woman’s real intention was clearly the spa. He sighed, “Then why am I here?”

“To pay, of course! I originally planned to introduce you to the beautiful Mo Ling as a reward, but it seems unnecessary now. Still, you’re footing the bill,” Lin Lin said with a flirtatious laugh.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes again. She had dragged him out as a human ATM. As for Mo Ling, her temper was too unpredictable for his liking.

Mo Ling, overhearing, pouted. “Sister Lin Lin, how could you sell out a friend like this?”

“I was just introducing you to a handsome guy! You’re not getting any younger—it’s time to find a boyfriend,” Lin Lin teased.

Mo Ling shot her a glare, cheeks flushing. “I’d never want someone like him as a boyfriend!”

“Don’t believe her, Mo Ling. Lin Lin wanted to see Guan Yu herself but used you as an excuse,” Li Xi exposed, cutting through the charade.

“Xi Xi, you’re just getting back at me! I never denied wanting to see Guan Yu. Unlike *you*, pretending not to care while secretly being interested,” Lin Lin retorted, her eyes glinting mischievously.

Guan Yu felt a headache brewing. The conversation kept veering toward him. He quickly changed the subject. “Sis, didn’t you want that spa? Let’s hurry.”

Lin Lin shrugged and dropped the teasing.

The four exited the airport, where Tian Xun stood waiting beside a Mercedes. Upon seeing Guan Yu, he expressionlessly opened the car door, fulfilling his duty as a driver.

Guan Yu winced inwardly.

“Who’s this?” Li Xi asked, eyeing Tian Xun.

“A friend. He drove me here because… my hands got slightly injured this morning,” Guan Yu explained vaguely, avoiding mention of Tian Xun’s protective role or name without permission.

“Injured?” Li Xi frowned. “You were fine this morning.”

“A minor accident. Both shoulders have hairline fractures,” Guan Yu said flatly, sniffing.

Li Xi studied him skeptically but didn’t press further.

Lin Lin, however, fretted, “Hairline fractures? Why aren’t you at the hospital?”

“I know some medicine. No need for hospitals,” Guan Yu replied casually.

“You practice medicine?” Lin Lin’s eyes lit up with curiosity. “Little brother, you’re full of surprises! What ailments can you treat?”

“Most things, I suppose,” Guan Yu shrugged.

Mo Ling scoffed. “Stop boasting. You think you’re Hua Tuo? Curing *any* illness?”

Guan Yu ignored her. Lin Lin, too, let it drop, treating his claim as a joke.

They split into two cars—Guan Yu in his, the three women in Li Xi’s Maserati—and headed to the club.

Named *Jingya* (Serene Elegance), the club occupied Kyoto’s busiest district. Two entrances flanked the entrance: one for the spa, the other for dining. Inside, tranquility replaced the city’s bustle, living up to its name.

The spa’s VIP lounge catered to men waiting for their partners. When the three stunning women entered, the room hushed, all eyes drawn to their curves. The atmosphere shifted when Guan Yu followed, earning him envious and disdainful glances.

Lin Lin leaned close, giggling. “See their jealousy? Worth paying for, right?”

Guan Yu grimaced. “They’re practically labeling me ‘manure beneath three flowers.’ Sitting here’ll be torture.”

Lin Lin laughed, her chest trembling. Guan Yu stole a glance.

“Ungrateful,” she chided playfully.

A server approached. “Welcome. Please present your membership card for service tier verification.”

“Card? Can’t we just pay?” Guan Yu blurted.

The server paused, still polite. “Sir, membership tiers dictate service levels. Perhaps the ladies have cards?”

Before Guan Yu could ask Lin Lin, a shrill voice cut in: “Look at this hick! No clue about memberships, pretending to be rich. Brother, show them your gold card!”

A garishly dressed woman clung to a pot-bellied man, who sneered, “I once saw a poser flee from the bill. Pathetic.”

Guan Yu turned, scowling.

**Chapter 449: Just Messing With You**

The man preened under Guan Yu’s glare, mistaking it for shame. “She calls me ‘brother,’” Guan Yu said coldly. “You’re old enough to be her father. Shameless.”

The man reddened. “Y-you’re spouting nonsense!”

“Denying it? Real men own their actions.” Guan Yu turned to the woman. “A student selling herself to this relic? At least pick someone classy.”

“Bastard!” she shrieked.

“Better a bastard than a disgrace. Your parents must weep.”

“I’ll kill you!” she snarled.

“Without him, you’re nothing. And *he*’s nothing.” Guan Yu dismissed them.

The trio stared at him. “Do I look handsomer?” he quipped.

Li Xi remained impassive; Mo Ling rolled her eyes. Lin Lin laughed. “Adorably fierce! But showtime’s over.” She handed the server a standard card.

The woman sneered, flashing a gold card. “Priority for *real* members. Process mine first.”

Lin Lin feigned awe. “A gold card! A million yuan entry fee! How impressive.”

The man puffed up. “I’ll gift it to you.” He snatched the card from his mistress, ignoring her protests.

Lin Lin smirked. “Sorry, I only date diamond-tier men.”

The man exploded. “Diamond’s for Yusheng Group execs! You’re mocking me!”

“Exactly,” Lin Lin purred.

Guan Yu suddenly recalled the gold card from Yusheng’s chairman. He pulled it out. “Would this count?”

**Chapter 450: All Services**

The man scoffed. “Diamond cards are black. That’s fake!”

The server, however, gasped. “P-platinum VIP! Unlimited access to *all* Yusheng services!”

The room froze. Platinum cards were mythically rare.

Guan Yu arched a brow. “So… it works?”

The server bowed deeply. “Sir, your companions will receive our utmost care. Everything—spa, dining, *everything*—is complimentary.”

The couple turned ashen. Guan Yu smiled. “Seems my ‘fake’ card trumps your gold.”

Lin Lin looped her arm through his. “Diamond? No—*platinum*. Let’s enjoy!”

As they strode past the stunned onlookers, Guan Yu chuckled. Being a “country bumpkin” never felt so satisfying.
