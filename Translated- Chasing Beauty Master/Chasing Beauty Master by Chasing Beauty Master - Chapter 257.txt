As for how large her breasts were or how pleasurable the sensation might be—fuck, they were all about to die! How could Guan Yu possibly be in the mood to notice such things?

Soon, Mo Ling also began losing strength, nearing collapse. Guan Yu swam to her side, gripping her wrist with his right hand to transfer life energy.

Here, Guan Yu bore the heaviest burden. Not only did he need to constantly track everyone's positions, but he also had to monitor who was faltering and rush to replenish their energy. Consequently, his own reserves were draining exponentially. He could feel himself approaching his limits.

Yet he had to hold on—wait until the explosions tore open the hull so he could lead everyone to the surface.

The detonations continued relentlessly. The Haifeng had fully submerged, the area now a blazing inferno.

Finally, after two endless minutes, the opportunity came. An explosion ripped through the upper deck, creating a massive breach.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu hauled the continuously healing Mo Xun onto his back while grasping others’ hands, kicking fiercely toward the surface.

Thanks to Guan Yu’s ceaseless healing, their energy reserves remained sufficient to consciously form a human chain ascending through the water.

But the yacht’s ruptured hull had created a monstrous whirlpool. Violent undercurrents clawed at them, becoming their greatest obstacle to breaking the surface.

Ultimately, primal survival instinct triumphed. Five heads breached the waves.

Mo Ling hadn’t surfaced?!

After one deep breath, Guan Yu plunged back into the abyss.

**Chapter 647: Hope in Despair**

The moment their heads emerged, rescue teams spotted them instantly. Hauled onto lifeboats and rushed ashore, they received immediate medical attention.

Jia Ren stood on the rescue vessel, exhaling heavily upon seeing the survivors still breathing. Crushed by overwhelming pressure, he’d personally joined this operation.

When the Haifeng sank, Jia Ren had nearly despaired—consumed by regret for rashly trusting Guan Yu, allowing events to spiral beyond control. He’d abandoned all hope for the six’s survival.

Yet as despair gripped him, a miracle unfolded. These phoenixes rose from the ashes, still clinging to life. Jia Ren’s relief knew no bounds.

“Xiao Xie, their conditions?” Jia Ren inquired urgently.

“Reporting, Director Jia,” replied the subordinate. “The mayor’s son lost critical blood volume and is en route to hospital. Others suffer severe exhaustion but will recover with rest.”

“Excellent. Ensure their safety absolutely.”

“Then... Director, shall we continue searching for the two missing?”

“Absolutely. Expand the search perimeter immediately.” Though privately doubting their survival—especially regarding Mo Ling, second only to Mo Xun in importance—Jia Ren maintained protocol. As for Guan Yu? No relation, no concern. Such was life’s harsh reality.

The man who’d sacrificed most became an afterthought.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu scoured the depths. Twenty meters from their surfacing point, he found her—Mo Ling, unconscious, sinking slowly.

When he embraced her, his heart plummeted.

Her heart had stopped.

Eyes burning crimson, Guan Yu rocketed upward while unleashing his healing system at maximum output, pouring life energy into her frantically.

But the energy vanished into her chest like clay oxen drowning in the sea—utterly futile.

Agony and terror coalesced into a bestial roar as he accelerated.

Breaking the surface, they were spotted by expanded search teams. Hauled onto a rescue boat, medics initiated emergency procedures.

“Sir, let me check your—” a female rescuer began.

“Fuck off! Save her!” Guan Yu snarled, eyes wild.

The terrified woman joined Mo Ling’s resuscitation efforts.

Truthfully, Guan Yu deluded himself. None understood Mo Ling’s state better—her pallor wasn’t mere pallor, but death’s ashen hue. No pulse. Empty eyes. Extinguished vitality.

Yet he denied reality.

From their first meeting—emerging from a women’s restroom, her panic as he turned—to later clashes, using him as pawn, condemning his romantic entanglements... He’d always believed he disliked her. Yet discovering her missing, sensing her lifelessness—he’d been wrong. That supposed aversion masked care. Now, clarity came too late.

“Sir... prepare yourself. This lady, she’s...” The rescuer trailed off, cowed by Guan Yu’s demonic expression.

“No! Impossible! To the hospital—NOW!” he roared.

“Condolences,” whispered a trembling medic.

Clutching Mo Ling’s cooling form, Guan Yu sat catatonic.

At shore, ambulances awaited. Ignoring protocols, Guan Yu sprinted to open ground, laying her down. His copper coin artifact vibrated violently within his mind, channeling unprecedented surges of vital energy into her—still, no response.

Persisting until energy reservoirs emptied, Guan Yu finally collapsed with a despairing cry: “Mo Ling!”

His coin flared brilliantly before dimming entirely.

Darkness.

Yet... Mo Ling’s heart flickered.

**Chapter 648: Unspoken Feelings**

Ren’ai Hospital—L City’s only private facility, part of Mo Kai’s empire. Here, under Xiao Xiong’s orders, Guan Yu received elite care while lying unconscious for three days.

“No changes?” Xiao Xiong asked Director Luo through ICU glass.

“Neither deterioration nor improvement,” the director replied nervously.

“Three days...” Xiao Xiong mused.

Behind him, Luo sweated under unspoken criticism. This patient defied medical logic—physically robust yet comatose. “Perhaps... psychological trauma? Self-imposed withdrawal from reality?”

Xiao Xiong’s gaze shifted to the young woman dozing bedside. “Bring another bed. She shouldn’t sleep on couches.”

“Arriving this afternoon,” Luo assured.

As Xiao Xiong departed to handle escalating conflicts with rival Cheng Gui, he whispered, “May she wake him.”

Mo Ling jerked awake from nightmares. Seeing Guan Yu’s peaceful face, fresh tears fell.

Cradling his hand, she whispered memories: “Our first meeting—you exiting the ladies’ room. My panic... praying to every deity as you turned. Then you bolted like a startled mouse...”

“Later, learning you were Shirlei’s brother... our accidental night together... my unjust accusations... watching your romances... my heartache...”

“On that doomed yacht? I feared nothing with you there. Your commands—so assured, so magnificent. When swept away, I accepted death... content, yet regretful. You gave me redemption. Guan Yu... I love you. Please wake.”

Her tears splashed his arm.

**Chapter 649: Beloved and Lover**

“What’s so great about him?” came a hoarse whisper.

“Everything!” Mo Ling snapped automatically—then froze.

Guan Yu smiled up at her.

“You’re awake?!”

“For a while.”

Her joy curdled. “Oh?”

Grin fading, Guan Yu backpedaled: “Woke during your confession! But interrupting felt rude—”

“You...!” Mo Ling pummeled his chest.
