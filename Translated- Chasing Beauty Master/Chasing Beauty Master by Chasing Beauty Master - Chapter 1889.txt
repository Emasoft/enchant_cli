“Even if they were from the Jinyiwei, we were outnumbered that day. Over a hundred soldiers swarmed out from the Sky Prison,” Minister Qi said. “No matter how skilled the Jinyiwei are, they couldn’t have prevailed. Moreover, the Sky Prison had layered defenses and traps. Once discovered, escape would’ve been impossible.”

“Second Highness, you can’t blame this entirely on me. I warned you beforehand that preparations here were incomplete, yet you insisted on rushing the operation,” Minister Qi continued. “Fortunately, I kept a contingency. The men sent weren’t officially registered Jinyiwei agents.”

“Are you implying this is *my* fault? Your incompetence is now *my* burden?” The Second Prince’s dissatisfaction deepened. “You sent non-Jinyiwei men? No wonder they were captured so easily! Have you lost your mind? Had you dispatched Jinyiwei elites, this might have succeeded! Look at this mess—utterly infuriating!”

Minister Qi cursed inwardly, *This bastard! Had I sent Jinyiwei agents and they’d been captured, his head would’ve rolled by now. The Sky Prison wouldn’t just hold Old Master Cao in the death row cell—it’d have Minister Qi joining him!*

Yet he couldn’t afford to alienate the Second Prince. Too many schemes still relied on the prince’s protection. Swallowing his fury, Minister Qi bowed. “This failure is indeed my error, my negligence. But our priority now is addressing how to counter the Crown Prince’s moves.”

The Second Prince relented slightly. After all, Minister Qi had served him loyally for years, and the Jinyiwei’s strength remained indispensable. “What baffles me is why Father entrusted this matter to that imbecile Crown Prince! He’s never handled a case before! Has Father gone senile?”

“I was present during the audience,” Minister Qi replied. “Once it was confirmed the captured men weren’t Jinyiwei, the matter should’ve been settled. His Majesty initially seemed inclined to assign the investigation to me, but the Grand Princess intervened.”

“Just as I prepared to volunteer, the Grand Princess suggested entrusting it to the Crown Prince instead,” Minister Qi explained. “She argued that as an outsider, he’d handle it transparently without favoritism. His Majesty agreed immediately.”

“What?!” The Second Prince whirled around, eyes blazing. “The Grand Princess spoke for that fool? That makes no sense! Why would she side with a simpleton? There’s no logic here!”

“I wouldn’t dare lie about such matters,” Minister Qi affirmed.

The Second Prince frowned, muttering, “What game is my royal sister playing? She’s never meddled in court affairs before. By aiding the Crown Prince, she opposes *me*. What has he offered her?”

“Second Highness, let’s not overcomplicate this,” Minister Qi cautioned. “Recall that the Cao family kidnapped Princess Jiangxin—and the Crown Prince rescued her while capturing Cao Di. Perhaps the Grand Princess repays this debt by speaking for him.”

“Ah, that must be it!” The Second Prince nodded. “This explains her actions. At least we can confirm she hasn’t truly aligned with the Crown Prince. The situation isn’t dire yet.”

“Exactly. The Grand Princess keeps to herself, especially avoiding that dullard Crown Prince. She’d gain nothing by supporting him,” the Second Prince continued. “But saving Princess Jiangxin has granted him unexpected advantages.”

Minister Qi grew impatient with this tangent. His true concern lay elsewhere. “Second Highness, our pressing issue is containing the Crown Prince’s investigation. Should he uncover anything substantial and report it to His Majesty…”

“What’s there to fear?” The Second Prince scoffed. “That idiot couldn’t find his own nose in a mirror! I heard he spent all morning torturing prisoners yet extracted nothing. Your men’s loyalty deserves praise.”

“I anticipated risks,” Minister Qi said proudly. “Those sent were deathsworn I’ve cultivated for years. Neither torture nor death could loosen their tongues. The Crown Prince gains nothing from them.”

Straightening his posture, Minister Qi added, “Though training such men wasn’t easy. Three perished during the Sky Prison ambush. If possible, I implore Your Highness to help rescue the survivors.”

“Can’t you simply swap them with doubles?” The Second Prince asked dismissively.

“Were it that simple, I wouldn’t seek your aid,” Minister Qi grimaced. “His Majesty has forbidden all Jinyiwei from approaching the Sky Prison. Our operations are suspended until the investigation concludes.”

“The Emperor issues such orders despite knowing the Jinyiwei’s innocence? He suspects you,” the Second Prince mused. “This complicates matters.”

“Precisely! The Grand Princess’s remarks implicated me while praising the Crown Prince’s neutrality. We’re all under suspicion now.”

“Have you cleaned up thoroughly?” The Second Prince demanded.

“All involved were paid handsomely to leave the capital permanently. Yet anxiety plagues me—I scarcely sleep.”

“Coward!” The Second Prince snapped. “I bear the heavens’ weight! Fear nothing! That imbecile Crown Prince uncovers nothing! Dispose of the prisoners—eliminate all risks.”

Minister Qi’s heart ached. Years spent nurturing these deathsworn, now wasted. Their loyalty mattered more than martial skill—a loyalty now sacrificed.

“Since rescue proves impossible, sever all ties,” the Second Prince decreed. “Dead men tell no tales. Without them, the Crown Prince’s investigation collapses.”

Before Minister Qi could protest, a coded knock interrupted. A cloaked spy entered, face obscured save shrewd eyes. He hesitated until the Second Prince growled, “Speak freely.”

“The Crown Prince visited General Jiang Yuan’s estate this morning, staying half an hour,” the spy reported. “Later, he went to Fuman Inn to meet Wan Hong for an hour. Finally, he returned home, donned the imperial yellow jacket, and marched to Jinyiwei headquarters with guards.”

“What?!” Minister Qi paled. “Is he raiding the Jinyiwei?”

“Stay!” The Second Prince barked as Minister Qi moved to leave. “Fool! The target isn’t the Jinyiwei—it’s *you*! Returning now is suicide!”

Chapter 4966: Apprehensions

“But why approach Jiang Yuan?” The Second Prince pondered. “That martial recluse avoids court affairs. When Father offered him command of the imperial guards, he refused!”

The spy continued, “After Fuman Inn, the Crown Prince proceeded directly—”

“Idiots!” The Second Prince suddenly roared. “Why didn’t you eavesdrop on Wan Hong’s meeting?!”

“Forgiveness, Highness!” The spy kowtowed. “Wan Hong’s senses are preternatural. Approaching would’ve revealed us.”

Minister Qi sneered, “Worthless cowards! You should’ve risked it!”

“Enough!” The Second Prince glared. “Wan Hong’s prowess justifies caution. What else?”

“The Crown Prince left Fuman Inn and returned home. Then... he took men in yellow jackets to the Jinyiwei headquarters.”

Minister Qi shuddered. “He’s making his move! We must act!”

“Fool!” The Second Prince seized his arm. “This is precisely their trap! Walk in now, and you gift them victory! We wait—and watch.”
