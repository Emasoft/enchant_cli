Xue Jing shook her head upon seeing Guan Yu’s furious expression. “Second Boss, it’s not that I won’t help you, but my words hold no sway here. Guan Yu has never listened to me—the beauties standing beside us can attest to that. If he actually heeded my advice, do you think I’d let him charm so many women?”

Guan Yu indeed had no intention of sparing He Chuan. Though the Second Boss had intervened today, had this confrontation occurred elsewhere, the hundred-strong mob would have overwhelmed him, likely injuring the women with him. If their positions were reversed, would He Chuan show mercy? Spare these beauties? Clearly not.

Yet the Second Boss seemed genuinely acquainted with him from the past. Last time, after Guan Yu trashed one of Mike’s VIP rooms, no compensation had been demanded. Recalling this, Guan Yu strode wordlessly toward He Chuan’s crumpled form and kicked him brutally in the abdomen. The unconscious man rolled across the floor like a discarded sack.

A mouthful of blood sprayed from He Chuan’s lips. Guan Yu turned to the Second Boss. “He’ll live, though he’ll be hospitalized for months. I spare him today, but never wish to see his face again.”

The Second Boss hadn’t expected this concession, having assumed He Chuan’s death inevitable. Even if Guan Yu had beaten the man to death, the Second Boss dared not protest. Though amnesiac, Guan Yu’s latent influence remained—few dared cross him.

“That blind fool!” the Second Boss exclaimed gratefully. “To provoke someone he shouldn’t—this reflects my leniency. I’ll ensure he vanishes from your sight. Thank you for your mercy.”

Guan Yu nodded, the night’s events leaving him disinclined to linger. As the hundred-strong entourage dispersed, the hall emptied. Lan Yu’s thoughts churned most violently—she’d underestimated Guan Yu’s capabilities. From her father, she knew Mike’s Karaoke Bar held immense sway across City A’s underworld. That its Second Boss groveled before Guan Yu spoke volumes.

*What a magnificent man! Handsome, skilled, influential... I’m yours.* Her heart fluttered secretly.

Amei felt unsurprised. She’d long known Guan Yu extraordinary—a singular existence. However many women surrounded him, each received his utmost care.

Pan Xiaoxia regarded Guan Yu anew. That her student wielded such power! She’d assumed him merely cultivated, but his hidden backing proved staggering.

Yet Pan erred—Guan Yu needed no patron. His former self had required none, relying on personal prowess and lovers who’d carved his commercial empire.

The Second Boss sighed deeply at He Chuan’s motionless form, ordering subordinates to hospitalize him. “Guan Yu,” he bowed, “today’s disgrace stems from my worthless brother-in-law’s blindness. Henceforth, all your expenses at Mike’s are waived. You’ve always been my idol—pray visit often.”

“No need for formalities,” Guan Yu replied coldly. “Xue Jing mentioned our past acquaintance. I never seek trouble—but he targeted my women. Touch my bottom line, pay the price. Only your face saved his life.” His icy tone left no doubt—rage still simmered.

“Understood! Such incidents won’t recur,” the Second Boss assured obsequiously.

Weary of festivities, Guan Yu departed with his beauties. Amei, ever perceptive, decided not to complicate matters. Seeing Guan Yu safe and happy sufficed—her simple wish.

Approaching, she murmured kittenishly, “Guan Yu, I’ve tomorrow’s rehearsal... My concert’s on the 18th at City A Stadium. Please come?” Producing VIP tickets, she added, “Though faint in your memory... we’re new friends.”

“New friends...” Amei’s heart twinged, yet she resolved: *So long as he doesn’t reject me, I’ll stay—even as maid or servant.*

Lü Mei snatched tickets excitedly. “I’m coming too! Amei, I forgot to ask—you’re my idol! Autograph?”

“Gladly!” Amei smiled.

“Sign my bag! Thank you!” Lü Mei beamed.

As Amei’s convoy arrived, reluctant farewells ensued. Pan Xiaoxia chuckled, “I’ll head back too—today was thrilling!”

“Teacher Pan,” Guan Yu teased, “seem violent-inclined? Apologies for missing your treatment.”

“No rush.” She waved goodbye.

**Chapter 1814: The Troublemaker**

Alone with Xue Jing, Lan Yu, and Lü Mei, Guan Yu arched a brow. “Why linger?”

Lan Yu pouted. “Why dismiss me first? You brought me here—now I’m lost! Take responsibility!”

“‘Ghost place’? This is downtown’s busiest district!” Guan Yu retorted.

Noting the bustling streets, Lan Yu mumbled, “Still... I’m lost.”

“Shameless hussy!” Lü Mei snapped. “Chasing another’s man!”

“Says the one out late with him!” Lan Yu fired back. “Where’s ‘his woman’ written on his face?”

“At least he kissed me in class!” Lü Mei flushed.

Incensed, Lan Yu kissed Guan Yu’s cheek. “There! Now he’s mine!”

“Shameless!”

Xue Jing intervened. “Lü Mei, your driver’s waiting.”

Left with Lan Yu, Xue Jing feigned concern. “Truly lost? I’ll call police escort.”

“No!” Lan Yu clung to Guan Yu, grinding his arm against her breasts. “Bad cops might steal my virtue! You’d regret it forever!”

Guan Yu surrendered. “I’ll take her.”

Xue Jing rolled eyes. “So easily tempted?” As she left, she muttered, “Why do all beauties swarm him? Even I’d succumb...”

**Chapter 1815: Conquest**

In Lan Yu’s Hummer, she chattered about past mischief—sneaking out, accidentally causing a castration via voyeurism. Guan Yu drowsed until she braked abruptly.

“Let’s play!” She grinned.

“Home. Now.” Guan Yu fled via taxi.

Lan Yu fumed. “What’s wrong with me? My suitors could stack a TV tower! Just wait—you’ll fall beneath my skirt!”

Wandering midnight streets, Guan Yu pondered his forgotten past when a scream pierced the silence.

Rounding a corner, he found thugs surrounding a bound girl under sickly streetlights.

“Serve us well, little flower,” a brute leered, hand snaking toward her skirt.

“Scream louder!” another urged. “We like it loud!”

From shadows, Guan Yu smiled grimly. *Time for heroics.*
