Madam Wan was the first to enter. As she walked, she said, “Master, with such commotion you still don’t wake. It seems you’re truly exhausted. Quickly rise now—no more sleeping. We have guests in the house. Get up at once.”

She continued speaking as she moved inward. Guan Yu and the others followed, their eyes sweeping across the study’s condition.

Truth be told, this Lord Wan slept like the dead. Even the door being kicked open hadn’t roused him—though perhaps the clamor outside had drowned it out.

Madam Wan approached and shook Lord Wan’s shoulder. Unexpectedly, his body suddenly slumped with a *thud*.

The sound of Lord Wan collapsing to the floor was followed by Madam Wan’s piercing scream: “Ah—!”

All eyes snapped toward them. Guan Yu’s pupils dilated as he saw Lord Wan sprawled motionless. His heart lurched—the man’s pallor looked distinctly unnatural. Dead?

Wang Xiaorong gripped Guan Yu’s arm so tightly her nails nearly pierced his flesh. Wincing, Guan Yu tried shaking her off, but she clung stubbornly.

“Master! Master, what’s wrong with you? *Wuwuwu…* Don’t frighten me like this! Get up now, Master! Please don’t scare me!” Madam Wan knelt beside the body, sobbing as she shook it.

Yue Gao immediately rushed over to examine the corpse. After a brief inspection, he shook his head. “Stop shouting. It’s no use. He’s already gone.”

*This spells serious trouble*, Guan Yu thought. They’d barely entered Lord Wan’s study before the man died? Lord Wan was no ordinary figure. His death might even stir up the imperial court in the capital. If blame somehow fell on their heads…

Guan Yu gently patted Wang Xiaorong’s shoulder. “Don’t panic. I’ll go examine him. You go alert the Wan household to notify the authorities immediately—tell them there’s been a death.”

Nodding obediently, Wang Xiaorong turned and fled. Guan Yu crouched beside the body, feeling residual warmth lingering in the flesh.

Lord Wan’s corpulent frame lay supine on the wooden floorboards, his face a bloated mass of fat.

Placing fingers against the carotid artery, Guan Yu detected no pulse. The man was dead—yet the body’s warmth suggested recent demise.

Gradually, Guan Yu noticed the corpse’s lips beginning to darken, deepening into a violet hue.

The reason for this discoloration eluded him for now. Further inspection revealed a tiny red dot behind Lord Wan’s ear—a wound?

Though clearly a puncture mark, Guan Yu couldn’t yet confirm it as fatal. His gaze swept the wooden flooring until he spotted something beneath the desk—an extremely slender needle.

While Guan Yu observed, Yue Gao busied himself. The detective placed his large satchel on the floor, undid its clasps, and withdrew white gloves. Slipping them on with practiced efficiency, he began examining the corpse.

Yue Gao had witnessed numerous murders—his solved cases likely surpassed even official investigations.

Noticing Guan Yu’s scrutiny, he smiled. “Guan Yu, do you have expertise in corpses too?”

“Merely an amateur’s curiosity,” Guan Yu replied diplomatically. As an outsider here at Madam Wan’s invitation, he knew better than to interfere.

Moments later, Wang Xiaorong returned. “The authorities are nearby. They’ll arrive shortly.”

“Good. Stay calm—we’ll see how events unfold.”

When constables arrived, their squad leader paled upon recognizing the victim. Lord Wan’s death would send shockwaves through the imperial court—a disaster for all involved.

The officer barked orders: “You! Fetch Magistrate Zhou immediately! This transcends our authority!” A soldier scurried off.

Meanwhile, Yu Qingtian and Wan Guocai rushed in, having heard of their father’s death.

Yue Gao ignored the commotion, systematically examining every detail—even removing Lord Wan’s shoes for clues.

When Magistrate Zhou arrived, the detective stood. “Perfect timing. I’ve completed my preliminary examination.”

“Ah, Detective Yue. Your findings?”

“Before conclusions—why are *you* here first? My office is closer, yet you arrived earlier?”

“Madam Wan invited me as her consultant. These are my associates. We discovered the body upon arrival.”

“Cause of death? Lord Wan’s demise carries immense repercussions—no room for error!”

Wang Xiaorong interjected: “It must be suicide! The study was locked from within when we broke in. No one else was present!”

Guan Yu frowned, stroking his chin. *The windows show no tampering. Locked room. No escape routes. A classic locked-room mystery.*

Magistrate Zhou pressed: “Yue Gao! This demands swift resolution!”

“First, gather everyone present in the last two hours for questioning.”

As servants were summoned, Guan Yu noted the household’s strict rules—only family members and the steward had access to the main building.

Yue Gao began interrogations. Steward Li recounted his movements: awakened by Madam Wan, preparing snacks for the young master and Qingtian, then admitting the guests.

“Can anyone verify your kitchen visit?”

“The night cook can attest—we conversed throughout.”

Turning to Wan Guocai: “After receiving supper, where were you when Madam Wan returned?”

“We came here,” the son admitted. “Father’s door was locked. When he didn’t answer… we thought he refused to meet Qingtian.”

Guan Yu calculated timelines. “Madam Wan’s alibi holds—we met her at two-something. The timeline clears her.”

Only the senile grandfather remained unaccounted. Though seemingly harmless, Yue Gao pressed: “Old Master, your activities since midnight?”

“Fishing!” The elder produced a scribbled note. “Caught this big one!”

*Dead end*, Guan Yu mused. Yet the detective’s thoroughness impressed him—Yue Gao’s methods mirrored top investigators from his own world.

The puzzle remained: how did the killer escape a sealed room? Guan Yu inspected windows—no marks.

Yue Gao suddenly called out: “Guan Yu! Look at these books.”

The desk’s volumes stood unnaturally stacked—twenty-some books neatly piled as if staged, not read. A cold teacup sat nearby without a pot—likely brought from elsewhere.

Testing the tea with a silver needle, Yue Gao watched it yellow. “Not poison—a strong sedative. Incapacitating but not lethal.”

Guan Yu nodded. “This tea cooled hours ago. The actual murder occurred more recently.”

Suspicion fell on three: the son, his lover, and the grandfather. Motive existed—Lord Wan opposed his son’s relationship. But without evidence or means...

Examining the threshold, Yue Gao discovered fresh scratches. “Everyone stays put!” He dashed out mysteriously.

Noticing the thin wire marks himself, Guan Yu slipped away despite orders.

“Where are you going?” Wang Xiaorong chased after.

“To find something. Wait here—I’ll return shortly.”
