The Right Envoy’s words startled everyone, particularly the Red Lotus Sect and Zhenyang Sect members. Both sides knew that if the Demon Soul Sect intervened now, whichever side they targeted would suffer devastating losses.

The Red Lotus Sect faced greater peril, as they lacked any protective barriers, while the Zhenyang Sect at least had shields in place.

**Chapter 4664: Secretly Concealing**

“However, finding the exit remains my top priority. I’ve no interest in squabbling over this object,” declared the Right Envoy. With the sun already set and darkness imminent, time was slipping away.

She turned to Guan Yu and remarked, “I find it baffling how leisurely you all act. If we’re truly trapped here, what use is this Bloodstone? Even if one obtained the Eight-Drum Technique, it’d be meaningless if we can’t return.”

Though the Right Envoy seemed unaware they’d be automatically transported out at the appointed time, her ignorance proved fortunate. The Zhenyang Sect elder’s earlier assurance appeared reliable, and with the Demon Soul Sect showing no signs of interference, tensions eased slightly.

Guan Yu, however, secretly wished the Right Envoy *would* intervene to further destabilize the two rival sects. As he pondered, the Red Lotus Sect completed their spell formation, poised to strike.

The Right Envoy watched impassively, deeming their magic merely “passable.” Moments later, the Red Lotus Sect’s Elder Zhao roared, face flushed crimson. Instead of explosive detonations or energy surges, darkness abruptly engulfed everyone.

When vision returned, the desert stretched endlessly around them. Miao City had vanished without trace. Dawn approached, the eastern horizon hinting at sunrise, while Demon Soul Sect disciples stood visible in the distance near Miao City’s former portal.

While Guan Yu and the Demon Soul Sect members recovered quickly, catastrophe struck the rival sects. The Red Lotus Sect’s cultivators vomited blood, Elder Zhao collapsing with life-threatening hemorrhages. The Zhenyang Sect fared slightly better, though all bore injuries from spell backlash.

“So we were ejected when time expired,” mused the Right Envoy, surveying the dunes. “Had I known, I’d have spared the effort searching for exits.” Her tone carried resignation.

Spotting Guan Yu attempting to pocket the Bloodstone, she fixed him with a piercing glare.

“Aunt Right Envoy,” Guan Yu feigned innocence, “could the environmental shift have caused their backlash?”

“Likely,” she acknowledged coldly, her attention elsewhere.

Guan Yu’s heart sank. With the Demon Soul Sect’s numerical superiority, resisting their claim on the Bloodstone seemed impossible.

“You knew about the timed ejection yet let me waste effort?” the Right Envoy accused.

Guan Yu spread his hands. “I only heard the Zhenyang elder’s theory myself. Would you have believed me if I’d shared unverified claims?”

As Demon Soul Sect members approached to check on their leader, the distraction spared Guan Yu further scrutiny. The Zhenyang elder staggered up, declaring victory—until Guan Yu cried out:

“Strange! The Bloodstone’s vanished from my grasp! Could Miao City’s treasures be unremovable?”

His theatrical performance masked the truth—he’d secretly stashed the artifact. Though the Right Envoy noticed, she remained silent, ordering her sect’s departure.

**Chapter 4665: Futile Efforts**

“Impossible!” The Zhenyang elder scanned Guan Yu futilely before sighing. “All our strife for nothing. This expedition proved worthless.”

As the Demon Soul Sect withdrew, the decimated Red Lotus Sect and injured Zhenyang members were left behind. Guan Yu’s group reunited with surviving Yunqing Sect members—two missing, likely devoured by Miao City’s beasts.

Eager to depart with his hidden prize, Guan Yu suggested retreating to Xiao Mei’s Jiayi Sect.

“Our tents and camels await,” Xiao Mei agreed. “A year until Miao City’s next opening. Let’s regroup.”

En route, she pondered: “If nighttime ejects survivors, why do some remain trapped?”

“Perhaps casualties before ejection,” Guan Yu theorized. “Or certain zones like the Miao Lord’s forbidden core might block transportation.”

Though Xiao Mei lamented their failed quest, Guan Yu rejoiced inwardly—having secured both the Eight-Drum Technique and Bloodstone.

**Chapter 4666: Future Plans**

After resting at Jiayi Sect, Guan Yu prepared to return to Yunqing Sect. “Xuan Ming will learn no one obtained the technique. We’ll face no blame,” he assured companion Si Qi.

Xiao Mei bid farewell wistfully. Removing her iron mask in private, she pressed Guan Yu to extend his stay.

“Our paths may not cross again soon,” she murmured.

But Guan Yu declined politely. “Duty calls. But I’ll remember our friendship.”

As desert rains delayed departure, Guan Yu contemplated mobilizing Jiayi Sect as future allies. For now, sunburned and exhausted, his priority remained returning home—where new schemes awaited.
