Without heading to the guesthouse, Director Li and Director Nie settled into an office with sofas to discuss the case details in depth.

Meanwhile, major factions and gangs in City N—including Old Master Liu, Guan Yu's mentor Old Master Xu, and others—learned of Guan Yu's arrest. All parties began mobilizing connections. However, upon discovering this was part of a special provincial operation, their influential backers shook their heads, declaring the matter beyond their reach.

The scale of the incident in City N had grown too vast. Offending provincial officials and provoking the Jin family's influence? No one dared intervene lightly.

Chapter 265: I Want to See Guan Yu

Even former Provincial Department Director Liu found himself powerless, pacing "like an ant on a hot pan" yet unable to devise a rescue plan. The scandal's gravity compounded by the Jin family's involvement made matters intractable.

As despair loomed, a white-haired man leaning on a cane materialized before the police headquarters. Guards fiddling with phones at the nightshift window froze when he entered—trailed by eight Zhongshan suit-clad aides and soldiers radiating vigilance.

"Who's this grandee?" they wondered. Clearly no ordinary citizen.

"Is your director here?" the elder asked mildly at the window.

"Yes, but... who are—"

"Summon him." The old man turned to sit, waving at Fang Zhe. "Notify the Guard Department. I'm taking charge." His tone suggested trivial household chores rather than high-stakes intervention.

Upstairs, Director Nie answered a ringing phone, baffled. "A VIP? Military connections?" He nudged resting Director Li awake.

"Some elder with armed escorts demands to see Guan Yu."

"Military? What nonsense!" Grumbling, Li rose. Despite irritation, the escort detail warranted caution—a mere director couldn't risk offending such presence.

Descending, neither recognized the visitor.

"Who handles this case?" The elder tapped his cane. "I'll see Guan Yu."

As they hesitated, Fang Zhe flashed a Zhongnanhai bodyguard credential.

"Ah! Esteemed Senior!" Li Changqing fawned. "I'm Li, case director under provincial leadership—"

"Take me to Guan Yu. Now."

Li glanced helplessly at Nie, who stepped aside smugly.

"Denied." Li stiffened.

*Crack!* The cane smashed his mouth.

"You—!" Li clutched his lip, aghast.

"Even your superiors wouldn't escape my cane!" The elder swung again. Li caught it, nearly toppling the frail figure—only to face eight cocked pistols at his temples.

"On your knees!" Fang Zhe fired a warning shot.

Trembling, Li complied as the elder turned to Nie. "You. Bring me to Guan Yu."

Chapter 266: Negotiation

In the interrogation room, Guan Yu lounged opposite two guards until Nie dismissed them.

"Uncuff him. He leaves with me," the elder ordered.

Nie faltered. "But procedures—"

"Notifications will follow. Unlock him."

Alone, the elder assessed Guan Yu. "You're in deep trouble. Assaulting officials' kin? Your allies may weather this storm, but you..."

"Who are you?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Save a life for me, and I'll shield you from the Jins until my dying breath."

Guan Yu nearly laughed—the octogenarian's "lifelong" guarantee seemed comically brief. "Proof you can fix this?"

"My presence here proves it. Refuse, and prison awaits."

"Deal. Clean up the fallout completely."

"Done. The Jins persist only because their patriarch still breathes."

As they exited, Li—now disgraced and phone-blasted by superiors—watched helplessly.

"Remember my promise," the elder told Guan Yu. "But first—someone's dying. Move!"

Chapter 267: Connections in High and Low Places

Power laid bare: the once-arrogant Li now knelt, uniform stripped by a sentence. As Guan Yu passed, he smirked: "I haven't forgotten your hospitality."

"Enough!" The cane tapped. "Fang Zhe—strip his rank. Let's go!"

Li's disbelief shattered when his superior called, roaring: "You idiot! You've ruined everything! Prepare for suspension!"

Thus, Guan Yu walked free—the old man's clout overriding all.
