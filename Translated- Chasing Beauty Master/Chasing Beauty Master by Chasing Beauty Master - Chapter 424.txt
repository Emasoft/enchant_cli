When Song Huanyu saw Cao Xiping, he initially wanted to retaliate with curses. However, noticing Jiang Yiyi standing beside him, he immediately fell silent. After all, the Jiang and Song families had maintained generational kinship ties, sharing equal social standing. Moreover, in terms of status, the eldest daughter of the Jiang Family far surpassed that of a mere collateral relative like him from the Song clan.

Upon hearing Cao Xiping declare Guan Yu as Jiang Yiyi's fiancé, Song Huanyu's jaw nearly dropped in shock. He stammered, "Y-you... what did you say? Th-this... this brat is the eldest Miss Jiang's fiancé?"

Seeing Jiang Yiyi offer no rebuttal, Cao Xiping stated matter-of-factly, "What else did you think?"

*It's over. I'm dead this time.* Song Huanyu thought despairingly. *If the family learns I've offended the Jiang heiress's betrothed, I'll truly be exiled from the Song clan.*

As Song Huanyu stood frozen in panic, another young man emerged leisurely from the crowd.

This youth had sword-like eyebrows, narrow phoenix eyes, a tall nose bridge, and a slender physique reminiscent of leading actors in Korean dramas. His appearance immediately triggered squeals from female onlookers, with some shouting excitedly, "Song Zimo, I love you!"

*Song Zimo? The Song Family's future successor?*

Prior to arriving, Guan Yu had conducted preliminary research on the Taiwan-based Song Family, familiarizing himself with both the current patriarch and the designated heir.

Superficially, Song Zimo vastly outshone Song Shaoqin. Having graduated from Harvard at eighteen, he now served as a Chinese language lecturer there—the first ethnic Chinese to achieve this. At merely twenty-four, this accomplishment alone eclipsed both Song Shaoqin and even Guan Yu himself.

What truly intrigued Guan Yu, however, weren't these credentials but the man's ruthless methods within the Song Family. Despite his father being the least favored candidate for succession, Song Zimo's interventions had secured the patriarchy's transfer through what outsiders speculated as an emulation of Emperor Kangxi's "cross-generational inheritance" strategy.

Regardless, Song Zimo warranted Guan Yu's full attention as a formidable opponent.

“Yiyi, long time no see,” Song Zimo said tenderly, approaching Jiang Yiyi and gently brushing her forehead, causing her to blush furiously.

“Brother Zimo, it has been a while,” Jiang Yiyi replied with a faint smile, deftly sidestepping his intimate gesture.

Unperturbed, Song Zimo turned to Guan Yu. “You must be Guan Yu, Brother Guan?”

“You know me?” Guan Yu frowned. *We've never met, have we?*

In his eyes, this man with skin paler than a baby's and a figure more delicate than a woman's epitomized effeminacy.

“The Beijing Song Family contacted us. I'm well informed about your... activities,” Song Zimo maintained his smile, showing no apparent intent to seek retribution.

“And?” Guan Yu countered.

“There is no 'and',” came the unexpected reply. “The Beijing branch, though descended from our Taiwan lineage, has grown increasingly defiant under their current patriarch's remote governance. We're rather grateful you disciplined their heir. Why would we seek revenge?”

Few in Beijing knew of Guan Yu's Taiwan trip, but the Song Family had received detailed reports urging action against him.

“Oh?” Guan Yu's tone turned icy. “Even if you won't trouble me, I can't let your Taiwan Song clansmen off. This scum dared harass my wife. I intended to neuter him, but since Young Master Song has intervened, what compensation will you offer?”

“What does Brother Guan propose?”

Though Song Zimo's smile remained inscrutable, Guan Yu snapped coldly, “His lecherous eyes offended my wife. Let's casually pluck out both eyeballs.”

Even Song Zimo frowned at this extremity. “Brother Guan, isn't this excessive?”

“Excessive? Hardly!” Guan Yu pointed at Cao Dahai. “If my terms displease you, let this fool bear the punishment instead.”

Cao Dahai nearly wet himself. “G-Guan Yu! I-I warn you! I'm the president of Mainland China Bank! Harm me and you'll regret it!”

Guan Yu, aiming to pit his enemies against each other, feigned indifference. “Why would I harm you? I'm negotiating with Young Master Song. This doesn't concern you.”

Turning back to Song Zimo, he demanded, “Will you act, or shall I? If I intervene, both lose their eyes.”

Song Zimo inhaled deeply. “Must you be so ruthless?”

He'd assumed Guan Yu would show some face, never expecting such unrelenting audacity. Unbeknownst to him, Guan Yu's detection system had already discerned his true intentions—while feigning neutrality before Jiang Yiyi, Song Zimo planned to eliminate Guan Yu after he cured her illness, maintaining familial honor despite internal rifts.

“Young Master Song, if your wife were publicly harassed, what would you do?” Guan Yu bared his teeth, showing no quarter.

Song Zimo's expression darkened. “Don't you know it's wiser to resolve than create enmity? Or do you truly believe you can challenge the Song Family in Taiwan?”

“Whether I can is debatable, but I'm no pushover. Today I'll spare them for your sake. Without your intervention, neither would escape unscathed.”

“Then you leave me no choice,” Song Zimo declared. At his signal, several black-clad enforcers fanned out around Guan Yu—seasoned fighters from the Song Family's private forces.

Song Xiaoya nearly screamed in fright. Li Xi and Lin Dong immediately flanked Guan Yu, while Cao Xiping hesitated before joining them.

“Cao Xiping, I advise against meddling,” Song Zimo warned, though aware of the Cao Family's political backing.

“You don't command me!” Cao Xiping retorted. “I've never feared your pompous Song ilk!”

As tensions peaked, Jiang Yiyi interjected, “Brother Zimo, let this end here.”

“Yiyi, what do you mean?”

“Guan Yu is my physician. My father wouldn't want him harmed in Taiwan.” Her calm words carried the weight of the Jiang Family's authority.

Song Zimo's anger flickered before he waved dismissal. “Since Yiyi pleads for mercy, I'll spare them.”

“How magnanimous!” Cao Xiping mocked. “Pretending to grant mercy when forced to retreat!”

Guan Yu found himself increasingly appreciating the brash youth's style.

“Yiyi, do visit my parents when possible. They miss you,” Song Zimo recovered smoothly, ignoring the jab.

“I...恐怕 can't visit Uncle and Auntie soon,” Jiang Yiyi demurred.

“Why?”

“I'm going to the Mainland for treatment.”

“With him?!” Song Zimo's composure cracked. The implications were clear—the Jiangs would never normally let their daughter travel abroad with a man unless...

Seizing the moment, Cao Xiping sneered, “Guan Yu's her fiancé! Who else should accompany her?”

Though rage boiled within, Song Zimo gently caressed Jiang Yiyi's forehead. “Take care of yourself there, don't make me worry.”

After farewells, Guan Yu suddenly slapped Song Huanyu and Cao Dahai, following with precise kicks to their groins. The men collapsed, howling in agony—their reproductive prospects temporarily neutralized.

“Brother Guan, you've crossed the line,” Song Zimo said through gritted teeth, his previously calm demeanor fracturing.

Grinning mockingly, Guan Yu retorted, “You know what I enjoy most? Watching you seethe helplessly. It's... satisfying.”

As Guan Yu departed, Song Zimo crushed his phone in a white-knuckled grip.

Whether due to Jiang Family influence or other reasons, the Songs refrained from retaliation as Guan Yu's group prepared to depart Taiwan. The entourage—now including several beauties—drew stares at the airport.

“Brother Lin,” Cao Xiping whispered, observing Guan Yu's garish “Taiwan Girls Love Me” shirt and oversized sunglasses, “is he always this... eccentric?”

Lin Dong averted his eyes in feigned ignorance, while the girls found Guan Yu's roguish charm amusing.

After farewells with Jiang Yiyi's parents, the group boarded peacefully—unaware of a shadowy figure tailing them in Hong Kong.

“Young Master, the Hong Kong Li Family, having existing grievances with Guan Yu, has agreed to cooperate,” reported a subordinate to a handsome youth in sunglasses.

“Good. Monitor them closely,” the youth replied, a bloodthirsty smile playing on his lips as his sports car screeched away.

The flight proceeded without incident. Upon landing, Cao Xiping gaped at shoppers hauling bulging luggage. “They say Hong Kong's a shopping paradise—looks like free merchandise!”

When Song Xiaoya suggested staying a day, Guan Yu agreed, prompting cheers. As the girls departed for retail therapy, Guan Yu called his wife Wen Qing.

“Husband, when are you returning?” came the drowsy, alluring voice.

“Tomorrow, probably. Miss me?”

“Not at all!” she giggled. “Actually, stay away longer if you can!”

“Why?”
