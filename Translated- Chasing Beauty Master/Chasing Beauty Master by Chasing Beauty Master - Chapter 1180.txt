Now, it appears that Old Li only possesses the strength of a Second-Class Esteemed. Guan Yu hasn’t even unleashed his formidable techniques yet. Once he recovers his stamina a bit more, dealing with this Li fellow shouldn’t pose a problem.

The true faces of the Li family haven’t been fully exposed yet, so Guan Yu refuses to back down. He’s determined to utterly humiliate them. Guan Yu declared, “Li, it’s not that I look down on you. The moment I entered, I saw through you and your son—a pair of scoundrels. When Qiaoqiao handed out gifts, I deliberately tossed that watch into the fishpond just to see how you two would react.

“As expected, bullies who prey on the weak but cower before the strong—utterly incompetent except when picking on an outsider like me. Your wretched son got knocked down, and then you, the father, stepped up. Is this the Li family’s way of handling things? But today’s your unlucky day. You crossed paths with me, and I’ll make sure your fox tails are exposed. I’ll strip you of that hypocritical facade in front of everyone!”

Guan Yu knew mere words wouldn’t shake the Li family’s reputation in the crowd’s eyes. Action was necessary.

Li Gui sat on the ground clutching his stomach. After hearing Guan Yu’s words, he suppressed his pain and snarled, “Guan Yu, don’t get too cocky! Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”

“If you’re not afraid, stand up and fight me again. If I had your pitiful third-rate skills, I’d never embarrass myself in public,” Guan Yu retorted scornfully.

Old Li’s rage boiled over, his breath heaving. No one had dared insult him like this in years. He’d always maintained a dignified image, yet today this brat labeled him a scoundrel.

“This is beyond endurance! Today, I’ll teach you this ill-mannered whelp a lesson!” Old Li thundered.

Lin Qiaoqiao hurried to Guan Yu’s side and whispered, “Guan Yu, let’s drop this. I’m worried you’ll get hurt. That Uncle Li isn’t easy to deal with. Why not save your strength for tomorrow’s tournament?”

“You’ve all been fooled by this father-son pair for years. Today, I’ll make them pay. Though I don’t yet know all their misdeeds, give me two days—I’ll prove I’m not wronging them,” Guan Yu insisted.

“Why must you antagonize them?” Lin Qiaoqiao asked helplessly.

Guan Yu replied, “You saw it yourself. From the moment I entered your home, Li Gui targeted me. When the son failed, the father stepped up to show off. For such people, I never hold back.”

Lin Zhonggeng hadn’t expected Guan Yu to be so stubborn. Perhaps the young man was accustomed to dominance in the city, but this wasn’t his territory. If he truly offended the Li family, every member would hunt him down. As Lin Zhonggeng moved to speak, Old Li cut him off: “Brother Lin, save your words. Regardless of others’ opinions, based on his insults alone, I must discipline him. Otherwise, he’ll never learn his place!”

Lin Qiaoqiao asked again, “Guan Yu, why did you throw the watch into the pond? None of this would’ve happened otherwise.”

At this, Lin Zhonggeng clapped for servants to retrieve the watch from the pond.

Guan Yu told Lin Qiaoqiao, “That Li Gui fancies you. He targeted me the moment he saw me near you. I threw it away so that scum wouldn’t get it.”

Lin Qiaoqiao knew Guan Yu’s domineering nature. In City A, few dared oppose him, given the influence of his Yu Gang. Now, with neither side willing to back down, matters had reached irreparable heights.

Old Li ordered attendants to tend to Li Gui, eager to confront Guan Yu. Today, this arrogant youth would learn respect—or else he’d keep thinking himself invincible.

**Chapter 3024: Fox Tails Exposed**

As Old Li moved to strike, Guan Yu blocked him. “Don’t rush, Li. Let’s wait until they fish out that watch. Though I suspect that cheap 2,000-yuan trinket isn’t waterproof—probably flooded by now.”

“Guan Yu, compensate my watch! Qiaoqiao bought it for me! What right had you to throw it away?!” Li Gui shouted hoarsely, coughing from the strain.

“Young Master here just can’t stand the sight of you. Got a problem? If you’re so tough, stand up and fight me with your dad. Otherwise, shut up and sit there—you’ve no right to speak.” Guan Yu berated Li Gui like a dog.

Li Gui seethed silently, powerless in his injured state. Had Guan Yu still possessed inner energy, he’d have crippled Li Gui permanently, as he’d done to Sun Xu before.

Just then, two servants rushed out holding a small soaked box. Lin Qiaoqiao opened it to reveal an elegant men’s watch now fogged with moisture. The dial was nearly obscured—clearly waterlogged after prolonged immersion.

Supported by attendants, Li Gui limped over. Forcing a smile, he glanced at the ruined watch and exploded: “Guan Yu, you bastard! This was Qiaoqiao’s heartfelt gift! If you don’t replace it, I’ll drag you to hell with me!”

Guan Yu sneered, “Fool, quit deluding yourself. What ‘heartfelt gift’? Qiaoqiao has zero interest in you. How did your Li family cultivate such shamelessness?”

“Bullshit!” Li Gui coughed violently. “Qiaoqiao and I grew up together! Our bond needs no input from you!”

“Your bond?” Guan Yu laughed coldly. “Then ask her now—what does she truly feel?” His goal was to crush Li Gui’s hopes and provoke the Lis into revealing their true nature.

The crowd awaited Lin Qiaoqiao’s response. Publicly, she and Li Gui appeared close. Many even called her his girlfriend to flatter him, given the Li family’s local influence.

Li Gui pleaded, “Qiaoqiao, tell him! Tell him how close we are! One word from you, and this schemer will scram!”

Lin Qiaoqiao lowered her head. After a pause, she evaded: “Brother Li Gui, I’ll buy you an identical watch tomorrow. Please don’t be angry.”

Her dodge panicked Li Gui. “Answer properly! Make this guy understand our relationship!”

Lin Qiaoqiao hesitated. She knew Li Gui’s long-standing infatuation and the Li family’s marriage proposals. Though kind as a brother, she could never love him—hence bringing Guan Yu as a fake boyfriend.

**Chapter 3026: Reckless Provocation**

Old Li barked, “Take the Young Master home! Ensure he rests and doesn’t return!”

“Leaving so soon?” Guan Yu taunted. “Look at him—wants to devour me! You think you’re worthy to fight me? I’d slaughter you!”

As attendants dragged Li Gui away, Old Li prepared to depart, humiliation endured. But Guan Yu blocked him, stamina recovered.

“Old Li, weren’t you going to teach me a lesson? Running now that your son’s gone? Such a dutiful father!” Guan Yu loomed over him mockingly.

Old Li’s murderous glare could’ve shredded flesh. A seasoned veteran, he growled, “Step aside, boy. I won’t lower myself to fight a junior. Persist, and I’ll disregard the Lin family’s face.”

“I need no favors—this is between us. Weren’t you curious about my skills? Fight me, turtle!” Guan Yu provoked.

Never before so insulted, Old Li’s fury erupted. “Since you beg for a beating, I’ll show you pain!” He lunged bare-handed.

Guan Yu countered with Crane Style Boxing—a half-remembered technique. His fists drilled forward, forcing Old Li back.

“Your cultivation surpasses your son’s,” Guan Yu jeered. “Pity you met me.”

“Crane Style? Are you from Divine Avian Sect?” Old Li demanded.

“Divine Avian? Divine Dog Sect couldn’t lick my boots!” Guan Yu unleashed a flurry of techniques—Dali Finger, Luoqing Fist, Serpent Palm, nameless kicks—blending styles seamlessly.

Old Li staggered under the onslaught. Guan Yu exploited gaps in his defense, avoiding direct clashes. Without his signature spear, Old Li struggled.

*Thud!* A punch smashed Old Li’s nose, blood gushing. Guan Yu followed with kicks, flooring him.

Panting, Guan Yu pressed his advantage. Old Li realized he’d underestimated this youth. The Luoqing Fist variant baffled him—similar yet deadlier.

Guan Yu’s relentless assault left Old Li reeling. Without weaponry, the elder resorted to brute strength, but Guan Yu’s eclectic mastery overwhelmed him.

“Pathetic for a Second-Class Esteemed,” Guan Yu mocked, realizing he’d overestimated the rank. Seizing momentum, he intensified his attack, determined to end this before stamina waned.

The battle raged—Guan Yu’s adaptability versus Old Li’s experience. But with each strike, the Li patriarch’s arrogance crumbled, exposing the vulnerability beneath his esteemed facade.
