Guan Yu knew the murderer must be either Ah Huo or Ah Xiao. One of them was definitely lying, though he couldn't yet determine which.

Yue Gao declared:
"None of your three alibis hold water. Of course, the same goes for all of us here. Any one of us could be Master Qiu's killer."

"Exactly," Guan Yu interjected. "I can now confirm Master Qiu wasn't killed by some heavenly dog nor did he commit suicide. This was murder!"

"Murder?" Ah Xiao exclaimed. "If not the heavenly dog, who could possibly hoist Master's body onto that high beam? It's impossible!"

"Impossible remains to be seen," Yue Gao countered. "We'll await the magistrate's men for further investigation."

While waiting, Guan Yu suggested to Wang Xiaorong: "Let's investigate the mountain stream below. We'll return before the officials arrive." Taking her by the hand, he led her indoors under pretense of preparation – his true aim being to search the suspects' quarters.

Guan Yu's prime suspects were Ah Huo and Ah Xiao. Ah Wu's timely appearance during Yue Gao's midnight commotion provided him an alibi.

"Why are we here instead of the mountain?" Wang Xiaorong protested as they entered Ah Huo's sparse room. A single chair, unmade bed, and wooden clothes rack holding few garments comprised the entirety.

Ah Xiao's neater quarters revealed more secrets. A two-tiered wardrobe stood stuffed with garments crammed in the upper compartment while the lower remained empty. A round table held half-copied scriptures beside an oil-depleted lamp. The neatly folded bedding showed no signs of recent use.

Finding nothing conclusive, they descended the muddy post-rain path to the rushing river below the waterfall. Wang Xiaorong's delicate shoes became caked in filth as Guan Yu fruitlessly searched.

"I feel watched," she whispered nervously.

"Stay close," Guan Yu murmured, discreetly cocking his Desert Eagle pistol. "We'll return. The magistrate's men should have arrived."

Back at the temple, Yue Gao greeted them: "Any findings below?"

"None," Guan Yu admitted, noting the swarm of constables. "The coroner's examining the body?"

"That incompetent fool?" Yue Gao sneered. "Last month he declared a strangled, violated woman's death as drowning suicide! Had I my way—"

Their conversation halted as Ah Xiao emerged. Guan Yu questioned him about the three-year-old murder of Brother Ah Gong – an identical hanging case Master Qiu had suppressed as "heavenly dog" work to protect temple reputation.

"Twenty-five months I've been here," Ah Xiao replied. "Learned of Ah Gong's death through persistent questioning."

After dismissing Ah Xiao, Wang Xiaorong whispered: "Why suspect him? Ah Wu keeps invoking the heavenly dog myth."

"Ah Wu's terrified," Guan Yu reasoned. "But Ah Xiao's morbid fascination with past events troubles me. Combined with Ah Huo's lack of alibi..."

Their theorizing interrupted as the coroner concluded: "Death by hanging yesterday evening. No visible trauma."

Guan Yu's derisive snort attracted Magistrate Zhou's attention. "Master Guan," the official greeted, "your insights proved invaluable last time at the Wan residence. What say you now?"

"Murder," Guan Yu stated simply. "Evidence remains elusive, but two requests: First, let Yue Gao handle official statements. Second, detain all present until resolution."

As Zhou departed to cross-examine witnesses, Wang Xiaorong observed: "He's verifying our stories with Yue Gao."

"Precisely!" Guan Yu's eyes lit up. "Separate interrogations will expose inconsistencies. The liar among Qiu's disciples shall be revealed!"
