Observing the filming equipment beside Lao Luo, Guan Yu nodded readily and approached with Niu Le. Over the past few days, they'd learned this middle-aged man endured constant humiliation - lacking real authority, dismissed by subordinates, and berated by directors. He clung to this thankless job through sheer necessity.

Lao Luo patted their shoulders with emotion. "Thanks, brothers. Those bastards all slack off - not a single one willing to work hard!" With his spectacles, vest, and beard, he looked more director-like than actual directors - a cruel irony for a glorified errand boy.

The crew's reluctance became understandable as they hauled heavy camera stands and lighting rigs to the third floor. No sooner had they positioned a light stand than Gao Wei's manager spotted Guan Yu, eyes bulging in recognition.

"What are you doing here?" The manager, still smarting from their previous encounter, straightened with confrontational vigor.

Guan Yu ignored him with a chuckle, maneuvering past to set down his equipment.

"Enough! Unnecessary personnel clear out! We're cramped enough!" The manager barked preemptively before any director could speak, clearly targeting Guan Yu.

The young man leaned close, lips curling. "Regaining your swagger? Playing big shot again?"

"You..." The manager flushed crimson, glaring impotently.

Dragged outside by Lao Luo after completing their task, the group loitered in the corridor with cigarettes. "You know Miss Gao's manager?" Lao Luo inquired curiously.

"Little punk's got a grudge. Not worth acknowledging," Guan Yu shrugged.

Chapter 346: Madness?

A camo-clad youth nearby sneered. "You ignoring him? More like he can't be bothered with you! Why else get ejected like us? Why'd Miss Gao stop needing your help?"

Guan Yu froze, speechless.

"Fuck your grandma! My bro chose not to help! Understand shit? Scram!" Niu Le roared, fist cocked.

Waving off confrontation, Guan Yu tugged Niu Le away as tensions thickened. The corridor filled with awkward silence punctuated by cigarette drags.

Inside the set, Park Xu trembled while clutching plastic wrap, staring at Gao Wei bound to heating pipes with duct-taped mouth. His future stardom warred with conscience. Jaw clenching, he adopted a vicious smirk and advanced.

"Brilliant... A-list acting!" Crew members whispered as Park began layering plastic over Gao Wei's face. Beneath the wrap, a transparent oxygen tube should have been positioned at her nostrils after two rotations. But as staff moved to adjust, Park subtly shifted his foot over the life-giving tube.

Soon, Gao Wei's entire head resembled a mummified mask. "Bitch... You deserve this!" Park rasped with manic intensity, delivering scripted lines through genuine malice.

Observing Gao Wei's thrashing legs and muffled screams, the director scratched his ear admiringly. "So visceral! This is award-worthy acting!"

But terror engulfed Gao Wei as oxygen starvation bit. Her violent writhing turned to weakening twitches, neck veins bulging against pale skin. Head thuds against metal pipes echoed through the door.

Crew members glanced disinterestedly while the director marveled. "Perfect! Capture that angle! The leg position! Roll cameras!"

As consciousness faded, Gao Wei's struggles dwindled. Park watched sweat-drenched and grinning.

Just as filming concluded, Guan Yu burst in like a stampeding stallion. Spotting crystallizing droplets in the oxygen tube, realization struck - murder disguised as accident!

Without warning, he kicked a light stand flying and bulldozed through crew. "Get the fuck back!" he roared, charging forward.

Chaos erupted. "Is he insane?" the camo youth sneered outside. Niu Le's fist answered, smashing his face. "My bro's actions are beyond your shit-for-brains!"

Inside, Park screamed for security. Four bodyguards converged on Guan Yu, who moved with lethal precision - flooring one guard before seizing Park in a gravity-defying throw. A whip-kick launched Park ceilingward, crashing down in a dust cloud.

"Guan Yu! What madness?!" the director shrieked.

Ignoring him, Guan Yu tore at Gao Wei's plastic shroud. "Keep them back!" he barked at Niu Le, who brandished a cleaver at advancing guards.

As oxygen flooded her lungs, Gao Wei convulsed violently. "Shut the fuck up!" Guan Yu snarled at protesting crew, silencing the room.

Park croaked orders through bloodied teeth. Guards hesitated before Niu Le's blade. "He's committing murder!" Guan Yu coldly declared, delivering a teeth-shattering kick to Park. "Check the footage - he blocked her oxygen!"

Chaos turned to revelation as Gao Wei, freed but shackled, gasped out the truth. Guan Yu tossed the cleaver back. "Your problem now," he shrugged, turning to leave.

A trembling hand clutched his arm. "Don't go... I'm scared," Gao Wei whispered tearfully.

Chapter 347: He's Killing Someone!

Despite irritation at the star's capriciousness, Guan Yu stayed. The director offered hush money. "Accident? This was murder!" Guan Yu spat, reaching for his phone.

"Fifty million!" Park croaked from the floor.

Guan Yu sneered. "Rot in jail."

Chapter 348: Two-Timing

As police arrived, Gao Wei clung to her rescuer. The director pleaded: "Think of the production!" But Guan Yu remained unmoved, the starlet's grip tightening - her vulnerability awakening protective instincts he refused to acknowledge.
