Siqi held Guanyu’s hand, gazing intently at his face as she cried out inwardly, “Guanyu, wake up! It’s me, Siqi! I’m waiting for you... Please, wake up soon! We still have the task Master assigned us. You gave me such a fine magical tool, and I haven’t properly thanked you yet. Please wake up! I still need to teach you the sword flight technique...”

Though she merely called to him in her heart, Guanyu—locked in his desperate struggle to control the bone-refining energy warring within his body—somehow heard her voice.

“Siqi?” Guanyu’s soul responded, though no sound escaped, and those outside remained unaware. He realized then that in his current state, he must quickly resolve the battle between his internal energy and spiritual power.

After a fierce clash, his internal energy and spiritual power finally calmed, reaching an accord: the internal energy claimed dominance at his dantian, while spiritual power layered over it like a veneer.

This arrangement made perfect sense. Internal energy, when cultivated to its peak, would condense into a core, requiring little space. Spiritual power, however, grew with one’s cultivation—the more one amassed, the higher their mastery. Eventually, spiritual power would compress into a vast sea within the body, while internal energy crystallized into a core floating above it. This was the path of demonic and martial dual cultivation.

Suddenly, Siqi felt a slight movement in the hand she held. Startled, she blinked her tear-dampened eyes open, only to find Guanyu lying as still as ever.

“It seems it was just my illusion,” she murmured, her voice worn with exhaustion.

But then his finger twitched again—undeniably real this time. “Guanyu! Guanyu, are you awake? Answer me! Have you woken?”

Frantic, she seized his shoulders and shook him, shouting. After three days and nights of lifeless stillness, even this faint motion overwhelmed her.

“Please... stop shaking me. You’ll kill me at this rate,” Guanyu rasped weakly.

Siqi’s face lit with a radiant smile—one so bright even she hadn’t known herself capable of it. “Guanyu! You’re awake! You’re finally awake!” She nearly leaped for joy.

Guanyu slowly opened his eyes to the vision of Siqi’s exquisite features. Licking parched lips, he croaked, “Siqi... could I have some water?”

“Yes! I’ll fetch it right away!” She darted out like an eager rabbit, returning moments later with half a bowl. As she helped him sit up to drink, Guanyu suddenly realized he wore nothing but thin shorts.

Staring dumbly, he stammered, “Siqi... um... where are my clothes?”

Only then did Siqi recall she’d forgotten to redress him after wiping him down earlier. Her face flushed crimson—not the blush of apples or roses, but the scalded red of utter mortification.

Reading her discomfort, Guanyu tactfully changed the subject: “Water... please. I’m dying of thirst.”

Siqi abruptly stood, feigning annoyance. “Seems you’re well enough. Drink it yourself.” She thrust the bowl at him, turning her face away in a show of pique.

With a wry smile, Guanyu pleaded, “Elder Sister Siqi, have mercy. My tongue’s the only part I can move—my limbs are numb. How am I to drink?”

Chastened, Siqi quickly gathered him into her arms, carefully tipping the water into his mouth.

The commotion drew Elder Qing’s entrance. Coughing pointedly at their intimate pose, she remarked, “So the rascal’s finally awake. Good—means you’re out of danger.” Checking his pulse, she nodded at its strong, steady rhythm.

“Didn’t expect you two to be so close,” she added slyly. “No wonder she refused to leave your side. Young lovers, hmm? I’ll leave you to it then. Remember—” she fixed Siqi with a stern look, “—he can only drink water for the next twenty-four hours due to the medicine’s side effects. Keep massaging his limbs to restore sensation.”

“Understood, Elder Qing,” Siqi replied dutifully.

As the elder turned to leave, Guanyu called out, “When can I eat?”

“Not until tomorrow same hour. That medicine’s harsh on an empty stomach.”

Resigned to his hunger, Guanyu lay back as Siqi, now composed, dressed him with surprising skill. *She’d make a fine wife*, he mused drowsily before sleep reclaimed him.

**Chapter 3332: Fear of Snakes**

Once certain he slept, Siqi ventured out for food, finding only cliffside weeds until Elder Qing appeared. “Hungry? Follow me.”

Behind the hut, a hidden cave revealed a cozy chamber where a bubbling iron pot filled the air with savory steam. “Sit,” said the elder, stirring the contents. “Not what you think—I rarely eat, sustaining myself through spiritual power.”

“But it smells wonderful! What is it?”

“Snake stew.”

Siqi recoiled with a shriek. “S-snake?!”

Elder Qing chuckled. “A cultivator afraid of snakes? This one’s special—venomous bile, but nourishing meat. Meant for Guanyu anyway.”

As the broth simmered, their talk turned to Guanyu. “That seal in his mind...” the elder mused. “Like a black hole devouring his memories and cultivation. The Merit Cauldron attacked it during the empowerment, nearly killing him. Xuanming seems to know more.”

“Will there be lasting harm?” Siqi worried.

“Hard to say. The clash of energies ravaged his mind. But most of the cauldron’s power went to him—your friends only got scraps.”

**Chapter 3333: A Life Reclaimed**

“He’ll live,” Elder Qing concluded. “That seal... I’ve never felt such power. Without it, he’d likely be a Realm Sovereign. Xuanming dotes on him?”

“Excessively. Since his arrival, Guanyu outshines all.”

“No wonder—a dual cultivator could reshape our world. His path is...” The elder paused, tasting the stew. “Done. Let’s feed our miracle survivor.”

As they returned, neither noticed the shadowed figure observing from the cliffs—a reminder that Guanyu’s borrowed life remained precariously balanced between past and future.
