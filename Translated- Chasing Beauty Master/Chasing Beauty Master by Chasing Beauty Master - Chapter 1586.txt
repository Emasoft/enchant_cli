After descending, Guan Yu said, “Everyone, lend a hand. Let’s move all the injured into the rooms.” He began organizing from the first floor, where the room numbers started at 1211. Nearly ten people were wounded.

“Let’s do this: two people per room. Separate the injured and the able-bodied. Assign one injured and one caretaker to each room. Since we’re all in this together, mutual care benefits everyone. Let’s avoid complaints.”

Guan Yu’s arrangement proceeded smoothly. Most showed no objections, and some even volunteered to care for their injured friends, fostering a harmonious atmosphere that pleased him greatly.

He continued, “I’ll distribute keys to the rest. Pair up—two per room. If anyone has special requests, like a solo room, speak now.”

“I’d like to stay alone,” a man lazily raised his hand. “I’ve had stomach issues and a fever lately. Don’t want to infect anyone.”

Guan Yu appreciated his consideration. Such foresight prevented future conflicts. “Approved. Here’s your key. Anyone else?”

A scruffy, bearded elder clutching a long pipe stood. “I’d prefer solitude. I’m messy and smoke constantly. Don’t want to bother others.” Guan Yu agreed and handed him a key.

The process concluded without issues. Once single rooms were allocated, Guan Yu addressed the group again: “As you’ve noticed, the third-floor rooms are more luxurious. Three remain. Those staying there must guard Prince Zou’s safety. Six responsible volunteers—two per room—step forward.”

Two middle-aged men resembling brothers approached. “We’ll take the third floor. Not for luxury, but confidence in our capabilities.”

Guan Yu observed their striking resemblance—likely blood relatives. With all rooms assigned and no complaints, the group dispersed after eating in the mess hall.

In his room, Guan Yu dined with Wang Xiaorong, Wang Jun, and Xiao Zhi. Wang Jun teased, “Your room’s bigger than ours. How about swapping?”

Xiao Zhi retorted, “They’re identical. Stop nitpicking.”

Wang Xiaorong snapped, “So what if it’s bigger? We need space because Guan Yu and I move around in sleep. Got a problem?”

Wang Jun chuckled nervously, “None at all. Wouldn’t dare oppose the young mistress.”

Xiao Zhi ribbed, “You’ve got a sharp tongue. Always asking for trouble, eh?”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “Stop calling him ‘Old Cang’ in private! His disguise already irks me. That name makes it worse.”

“No,” Guan Yu insisted sternly. “Use ‘Old Cang’ consistently. Walls have ears. We can’t afford slips.”

“Fine,” Wang Xiaorong relented, submissive as ever unless playfully teasing.

As thunder rumbled outside, Wang Xiaorong grimaced. “Ugh, I hate storms. Ruins everything.”

Xiao Zhi noted, “This downpour might delay tomorrow’s journey. Wonder what the prince will decide.”

Guan Yu agreed. Muddy mountain paths would hinder carriages. Prince Zou’s entourage might be stranded.

Wang Jun shrugged, “Good for us. Extra rest days.”

“But the lodging fees here are steep,” Xiao Zhi countered. “Doubt the prince will approve.”

“He’s a prince,” Wang Jun said through mouthfuls. “Feeding this crowd’s already costly. What’s a few more rooms?”

As rain drummed relentlessly, Wang Xiaorong sighed. “Wanted to stroll after dinner. Now we’re stuck.”

Guan Yu remarked, “The receptionist warned about rainy seasons. Seems accurate.”

When the men lingered after eating, Wang Xiaorong shooed them. “Finish up! We need rest.”

Alone, Guan Yu asked gravely, “Why did Yan Zhao attack Prince Zou? Was this the Demon Lord’s plan? Does he risk your safety here?”

“No!” Wang Xiaorong hastily explained. “Father accepted a contract to kill the prince before knowing you were guarding him! Once I informed him, he recalled Yan Zhao. You’re safe now.”

Relieved, Guan Yu gazed outside. Lightning revealed a figure practicing swordplay in the storm. “Look—someone training in this weather!”

As Wang Xiaorong approached, Guan Yu decided, “I’ll investigate. Might learn something.”

She pouted. “Now? Can’t you stay? Or… are you thinking of challenging the Swordless Immortal?”

The legendary undefeated swordsman obsessed Guan Yu. “Merely curious. I must see if the tales hold truth.”

Wang Xiaorong clung to him. “Every challenger dies! Please… just come back alive.”

He embraced her. “I will. My skills aren’t of this world. Trust me.”

“Then promise!” Her voice trembled. “Even if you face him… promise to return!”

“I promise.” Guan Yu smiled. “But first, let’s see who braves this storm.”

**Chapter 4113: Heavy Rain**

Outside, the deluge obscured the swordsman’s features. Guan Yu approached, mind racing with questions. The Swordless Immortal’s mystery called—a siren song for warriors. Yet Wang Xiaorong’s fearful eyes haunted him. Survival mattered now, not glory.

**Chapter 4114: Path of No Return**

Inside, Wang Xiaorong paced. “Why must men seek death? The Swordless Immortal’s fortress is a graveyard!”

Guan Yu’s laughter echoed from the doorway. “Not a graveyard yet. That practitioner? Just a dedicated disciple. Says the master accepts no visitors… unless challenged.”

Her heart sank. She knew that glint in his eyes—the same that drove him to master impossible techniques.

**Chapter 4115: Return Alive**

“Take me with you,” she begged.

“No. Mortals barely survive. A cultivator like you?” He cupped her face. “Wait here. When I return, we’ll tour your father’s halls like common tourists.”

“Tourists?” She frowned.

“People who pay to sightsee.” He kissed her forehead. “Sleep. Tomorrow’s decision rests with the prince.”

Alone, Wang Xiaorong whispered to the storm, “Gods of rain, drown his recklessness. Bring him back… or I’ll flood your heavens.”

Beyond the inn, Guan Yu watched the swordsman’s relentless drills. Each strike carved through rain, a dance with lightning. For the first time, doubt flickered. Could any blade match nature’s fury? Or the immortal who tamed it?

The downpour intensified, washing away footprints, secrets, and perhaps tomorrow’s choices.
