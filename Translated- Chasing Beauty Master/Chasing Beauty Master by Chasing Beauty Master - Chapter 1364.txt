“I wonder if the torchlight can be seen from above,” Guan Yu muttered to himself, walking to the center and waving his torch upward.

Wang Xiaorong had long been standing by the rope, waiting for Guan Yu’s signal. “Ah! Guan Yu’s signaling! The path below must be safe. I’ll go down first!” she exclaimed, already gripping the rope with eager haste.

Each person carried a torch to illuminate their way through the darkness. After Wang Xiaorong descended, Xiao Zhi said, “Siqi, you go next. Aze and I will follow last.”

Guan Yu waited below. Wang Xiaorong was followed by Siqi, and soon all four had climbed down. They lit their prepared torches.

“No way! The ground here is all muddy sludge. Ugh, it stinks!” Xiao Zhi complained, sweeping his torch around. “Wait—where’s the exit?”

**Chapter 3529: Poisoning**

“Over there,” Guan Yu pointed to a small opening in the corner.

Xiao Zhi hurried over with his torch and gasped. “This tiny hole? How are we supposed to get through?”

Guan Yu shook his head. Xiao Zhi, raised under Elder Zheng’s care, had lived a sheltered life devoted to cultivation. Such harsh conditions were foreign to him.

“The opening’s just narrow. The Demon Soul Sect likely found and widened it with hammers,” Guan Yu explained.

The “old fox” Wang Xiaorong had mentioned—Qin Manor’s Steward Sun—had clearly scouted thoroughly. Discovering this passage had unlocked the entrance to Duobao Mountain. What once appeared as solid stone walls now revealed a hidden path after relentless exploration.

“Let’s hurry! This stench is unbearable,” Wang Xiaorong whined.

“It’s only the entrance. I’ll go first. Follow once I’m through. There shouldn’t be danger here,” Guan Yu said, kneeling to toss his torch ahead before crawling through.

On the other side, he stood and observed the deliberately sealed passage. The air hung heavy with decay, likely trapped for years in the depths. Oxygen grew scarce, making breathing labored. The tunnel ahead stretched beyond sight—roughly eight feet tall and wide enough for three adults. Its uneven walls bore marks of arduous manual excavation.

Once regrouped, Wang Xiaorong—the pampered young mistress—complained again. “This air is suffocating! Am I… poisoned?”

“You’re free to climb back up alone if you’d prefer,” Siqi snapped, viewing her as deadweight.

“I’m not leaving! Hmph!” Wang Xiaorong stuck out her tongue at Siqi before clinging to Guan Yu’s arm. “With five of us, two torches should suffice. Carrying so many is wasteful!”

Guan Yu nodded. “I’ll lead with one torch. Aze and Siqi, extinguish yours. Xiao Zhi will take the rear with another. This conserves torches and reduces oxygen consumption.”

Xiao Zhi agreed but nudged Aze. “Can you carry Guan Yu’s bag? Managing both it and the torch is tiring.”

“Of course. Hand over the extinguished torches too,” Aze replied, shouldering the load like a pack mule.

The group advanced in formation: Guan Yu leading, Wang Xiaorong clutching his arm, followed by Siqi and Aze, with Xiao Zhi at the rear. The stifling air reeked of pungent decay.

“This cursed place!” Xiao Zhi cursed as breathing grew harder.

Guan Yu explained, “Years of confinement let rot fester here. Oxygen depleted over time.” His mention of “oxygen” drew blank stares—the concept foreign to them. “Drink water. It’ll moisten your throat and ease breathing.”

“Guan Yu, let me sip from your waterskin,” Wang Xiaorong pleaded.

“Use your own,” he replied.

“But you told me to conserve mine!” she retorted. Defeated, he handed it over. Wang Xiaorong would never refuse anything of his.

As they pressed on, Guan Yu noticed the tunnel curving subtly. “Does the air feel… better?”

The others agreed. The earlier stench had faded, replaced by fresher drafts. Guan Yu deduced an external vent.

**Chapter 3530: Cold Sweat**

After replacing torches, the flames burned brighter—a sign of improved airflow. The path grew rockier. Wang Xiaorong tripped, saved by Guan Yu’s quick reflexes.

“Thank you,” she said earnestly.

Siqi seethed at their closeness.

Later, torch flames flickered unnaturally. Guan Yu halted. “Do you hear water?”

Silence. Then—a distant trickle. Fear gripped him: a surge could trap them. “Stay here. I’ll scout ahead.”

Cautiously, Guan Yu advanced until a bend hid the others’ light. The water grew louder. A loose stone nearly sent him tumbling into a circular well, its surface two meters below. Moonlight glinted through the opening above.

Peering down, he recoiled—a pale, bloated corpse in Demon Soul Sect robes floated below. Drowning victim.

Crossing required traversing the well. Guan Yu tossed his torch across, gauging the leap. The conical shaft narrowed upward. Jumping risked head injury. Swimming meant sharing water with the corpse—a grim prospect.

Returning, he briefed the group. “There’s a well ahead with a dead sect member. We must cross through the water.”

Wang Xiaorong balked. “I’m not swimming with a corpse!”

“You can climb out via the well,” Aze suggested.

“No! I’ll stay!” she insisted, refusing to concede to Siqi.

**Chapter 3531: Dilemma**

At the well, Guan Yu outlined options. “Swimming’s the safest, though…”

Even Siqi paled. “Must we share the water with… that?”

Xiao Zhi groaned. “Any alternatives?”

Guan Yu shook his head. The well’s walls offered no footholds. “We jump carefully. The water’s current is mild.”

Wang Xiaorong trembled but stood her ground. “I’ll manage.”

One by one, they plunged into the chill water, avoiding the corpse’s ghastly gaze. Guan Yu led, torch held high. The well’s damp walls echoed their splashes as they pushed toward Duobao Mountain’s secrets.
