“Wenwen, you must properly thank Baldy Qiang later. If it weren’t for him, I might never have seen you again.” Mei Fanglan’s weak voice sounded.

Wenya’s tear-streaked eyes ruined the half-done light makeup on her face.

She had been applying makeup at the rehearsal venue, preparing for the evening performance, when Baldy Qiang informed her of her mother’s critical condition and near-death crisis. Panicked, she rushed to the hospital without even changing clothes.

Fortunately, Mei Fanglan had been resuscitated and was temporarily out of danger.

“Ah, we all misjudged Baldy Qiang before. Who knew he was such a good man? After your father’s legs were broken, he’s helped our family countless times. This time, he rushed me to the hospital and even went to pay the hospitalization fees. There are still good people in this world!” Mei Fanglan said tearfully.

She sighed deeply: “But we should be most grateful to Xiaoyu. Without him, I might have died long ago, and your father wouldn’t have to worry about medical costs. Yet such a good person disappeared without reason...”

Wenya bit her lip, silent tears streaming down her cold cheeks. Her stubborn, heart-wrenching expression reflected her inner turmoil.

Her mind involuntarily recalled a figure with a faint smile—slightly thin yet robust. Guan Yu!

He had given her mother hope for recovery, opportunities to pursue her dreams, and restored her father’s dignity.

Guan Yu had transformed their family, giving Wenya her first glimpse of a bright future.

But fate played a cruel joke, mercilessly casting her from heaven to hell.

For Guan Yu had vanished without a trace.

She’d inquired about Guan Yu’s whereabouts from Wang Zhen and others, but even they didn’t know. Guan Yu seemed to have evaporated from the world.

With her mother’s condition worsening and no financial security, Wenya faced the harsh reality of returning to their hopeless former life.

“Xiao Qiang, what happened to you?” Mei Fanglan exclaimed.

As Wenya grieved, Baldy Qiang entered with a bruised, bloodied face. He spat blood-tinged phlegm and growled: “That bastard Li Zhi never gave up on Wenya. When I went to withdraw money, he ambushed me and stole it all!”

“If only Boss Yu were here, that bastard wouldn’t dare strut around here!”

“Aunt Mei, I’m sorry I couldn’t pay your fees,” Baldy Qiang apologized.

“What?” Mei Fanglan’s face paled before she sighed resignedly. “Xiao Qiang, this isn’t your fault. You’ve helped us so much already. This is my fate!”

“Mom, I’ll borrow money from relatives!” Wenya sobbed.

“Wenwen, don’t waste effort. You know our relatives avoid us like the plague,” Mei Fanglan said bitterly.

“Let’s leave the hospital and stop wasting money here!”

“Dammit! Stay with Aunt Mei—I’ll settle accounts with those bastards!” Baldy Qiang stormed out.

**Chapter 829: Battling for the Hospital Bed**

“Wenwen, stop Baldy Qiang! Don’t let him risk his life for us!” Mei Fanglan urged anxiously.

Wenya chased after him but returned empty-handed. “I couldn’t find him.”

Mei Fanglan fretted: “If anything happens to him, I’ll never forgive myself!”

“Mom, don’t worry. Baldy Qiang’s tough. Li Zhi can’t easily harm him,” Wenya comforted, though worry lingered.

Suddenly, a nurse entered: “Who’s Mei Fanglan?”

“I am.”

“Pack up. Another patient needs this bed.”

Wenya protested: “My mother isn’t discharged yet!”

“No payment, no bed!” The nurse left coldly.

A mocking voice sounded: “It’s me they’re making room for.”

Li Zhi swaggered in, sneering: “Wenya, this bed’s mine now.”

“You monster!” Wenya spat.

Li Zhi leered: “Such spirit! I’ll enjoy breaking you in bed.”

As tensions escalated, Li Zhi’s thugs assaulted Mei Fanglan, knocking her against a bedpost. Blood streamed down her face.

“Help! Someone help!” Mei Fanglan screamed, biting a thug’s arm.

The commotion drew bystanders, but none intervened. Emboldened, Li Zhi’s men dragged Wenya away as she fought fiercely.

**Chapter 830: Force When Persuasion Fails**

Li Zhi’s thugs manhandled Wenya while Mei Fanglan bled helplessly. Passersby averted their eyes, fearing involvement.

“Let me go!” Wenya screamed, kicking wildly.

Li Zhi grinned viciously: “Take her! Tonight, I’ll break her spirit!”

Desperate, Mei Fanglan lunged at the thugs, only to be kicked brutally. Her head struck a sharp edge, blood obscuring her vision.

“Help! Save my daughter!” she wailed, though none came.

The scene epitomized the helplessness of the poor against institutional indifference and brute force—a stark portrait of societal failure.
