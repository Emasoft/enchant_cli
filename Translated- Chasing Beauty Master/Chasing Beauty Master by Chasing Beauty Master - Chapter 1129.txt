“Rather than letting others take advantage of such a beauty, why not let me have her? I could even put in a good word to spare you from jail. Isn’t this a perfect solution? I suggest you think carefully,” Wang Erzi continued persuading.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Eighty-Nine: Hypocrisy**

No matter what the other party said, Guan Yu paid him no heed. He had already recorded every word, which could serve as evidence when needed.

Guan Yu pulled out his phone and dialed Yang Conghan. To take down this scoundrel, he needed coordinated efforts. With no protection at his side, he couldn’t afford to follow the police to the station recklessly.

“Guan Yu? Need something again? I really liked the flowers you sent last time…” Yang Conghan answered bluntly.

“Glad you liked them. You’re right—I’m in trouble and need your help,” Guan Yu replied resignedly. Yang Conghan often remarked that Guan Yu only contacted her when he needed favors, never otherwise.

It frustrated her deeply. Though she considered herself his girlfriend, he treated her like thin air—no check-ins, no affection—unless he required assistance.

Sometimes she wondered why she’d stayed with him so long. Any other man would cling to her day and night. Yet Guan Yu was different.

Perhaps it was this very difference that drew Yang Conghan—herself an extraordinary woman—to him.

“What happened?” Though resentful, Yang Conghan dared not complain. She’d never forget Guan Yu was the Yang family’s savior. He’d nearly died using the Jiezun Sheli (World Honored One’s Relic) to heal her father. For that, she’d help him unconditionally—a debt of gratitude.

Guan Yu explained, “Minor trouble. Remember Ling’er’s apartment? I’m at the gate. A thuggish city officer broke the guard’s leg. I intervened and struck the officer. Now he’s threatening to have me jailed. Need your help.”

“Preposterous! How dare he?” Yang Conghan fumed, her refined upbringing tempering her words even in anger. “Have the police arrived? Which precinct?”

Guan Yu felt reassured. Unlike Old Master Yang’s hypocrisy, Yang Conghan’s concern felt genuine—a rare sincerity in the Yang family.

“Ling’er called them earlier. They haven’t arrived. I need you to contact the Law Enforcement Bureau. That officer must lose his job. No leniency.”

“Easy. Get his name, and I’ll handle it,” Yang Conghan agreed promptly.

“Also, Old Sun’s hospital bills—make him pay. And notify the station. I’m unprotected here.”

Yang Conghan didn’t grasp his reference to being unprotected, unaware Guan Yu had lost his cultivation.

“I’ll make arrangements. Just ask which precinct the officers are from. No one will dare touch you.”

Sirens wailed in the distance. Wang Erzi shook his head ruefully, lamenting how this beauty would soon be “claimed” by others in custody.

Two patrol cars screeched to a halt. Four officers stepped out.

“What’s going on? Who called?” Guan Yu stayed silent, letting Wang Erzi speak first.

“Officers! I’ve been assaulted!” Wang Erzi wailed, morphing into a pitiful victim. “I was on duty when this man attacked me for glancing at his girl! Arrest him and that little slut!”

His uniform lent credibility. The officers eyed Guan Yu and Ling’er—her mask couldn’t hide her porcelain neck or soulful, aggrieved eyes.

“Daring to assault an officer? Looking for jail time?” one policeman barked.

Guan Yu sneered at their predictable bias. “He claims I hit him, and you believe it? What if I say he attacked me?”

“Nonsense! You’re spotless. Where’s your injury?”

“Must I roll in dirt to prove it? Is cleanliness illegal now?” Guan Yu retorted, baiting them.

The officer scoffed, “He’s clearly injured. Why would he lie? You think he’d frame a stranger?”

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety: Acting**

This cop had wit. Guan Yu countered, “He attacked my friend, breaking his leg. I accidentally bumped him during the scuffle. Now he’s faking injury to extort me.”

“Where’s this injured friend?”

“Taken by ambulance an hour ago—before your leisurely arrival. Prioritizing lunch over emergencies?”

The officers flushed, guilty of detouring for a meal and cigarettes en route.

“Your name? Which bureau?” an officer demanded of Wang Erzi.

“Wang Erzi, Third Municipal Bureau’s Enforcement Division. My van’s there. This brute disabled me—uphold justice!”

Guan Yu nearly applauded the Oscar-worthy performance.

As officers questioned both sides, one noticed Ling’er. “Regardless, assaulting an officer is serious. We’re taking you in.”

Wang Erzi gloated. “I’ll sue! He’s going down!”

“Need an ambulance?” an officer asked.

“No. Take me to the station—I’ll give full testimony.”

Limping theatrically, Wang Erzi shot Guan Yu a venomous glare.

When ordered into the car, Guan Yu asked coolly, “Which precinct?”

“None of your business. Move!”

Guan Yu dialed Yang Conghan. “They won’t say. Handle it.”

He handed the phone to the officer, who paled upon hearing: “I’m Yang Conghan of the Yang family. Which precinct dares detain my fiancé?”

“Ch-Changjiang Road Precinct, Ma’am!”

“Harm one hair on Guan Yu’s head, and your careers end. I’ll call your chief.”

Trembling, the officer returned the phone. Guan Yu pressed, “Old Sun’s at the hospital. Resolve this properly.”

Inside the patrol car, Wang Erzi schmoozed officers, spinning tales of Guan Yu’s “thuggery” while calling his bureau connections.

“My captain will crush him. Just wait!”

As the officer took notes, Wang Erzi whispered, “That girl… bringing her in too, right?”

His grin widened. The game was set.

**Chapter Two Thousand Eight Hundred and Ninety-One: The Full Picture**

Yang Conghan’s threat reverberated. The Changjiang Road officers now treaded carefully, realizing their detainee had unimaginable backing.

Meanwhile, Wang Erzi’s captain vowed retribution, unaware of the storm brewing.

Guan Yu observed coldly. This farce would soon flip—hypocrites exposed, justice served.
