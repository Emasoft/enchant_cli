“We’ve made some progress. After observing these past few days, the Blade Guards guarding Magistrate Cao change shifts every morning. Each shift change takes roughly half an hour. We’ll strike during that window. I’ve already stationed operatives within the prison and arranged for experts to act. We’ll move immediately when the opportunity arises.”

“So convoluted? Is this how you handle matters?” The Second Prince’s displeasure was evident. “The Imperial Guards truly prove useless. No wonder even the Crown Prince scorns you.”

His words cut too deep. Minister Qi seethed inwardly, feeling the prince treated them like dogs—offering no rewards yet berating them for imperfect results. How heartless.

This affair was indeed thorny. The princes, fearing complications, had personally stationed Blade Guards—an unprecedented measure. Though furious, Minister Qi dared not voice it. “Your Highness, had the Emperor not placed his own men there, we’d have resolved this long ago. Those Blade Guards are impenetrable—even gold won’t sway them. We’ve no alternatives.”

“I care not. You must conclude this swiftly. If their shift changes at dawn, strike tomorrow morning. No further delays.” The Second Prince’s tone brooked no argument.

Minister Qi nodded. The master had spoken. Success or failure mattered little now—he’d wash his hands afterward. Yet failure meant no second chances. This attempt must succeed.

Chapter 4954: The Operation Begins

Lacking confidence, Minister Qi hesitated to act, but the prince’s decree left no choice. At dawn, he’d deploy external mercenaries rather than Imperial Guards. If discovered fighting within the prison, hired blades couldn’t be traced back. Their anonymity ensured the Guards’ safety.

“This old servant obeys. I’ll make arrangements immediately.” His plan required outsiders to scout the prison before tomorrow’s strike.

At first light, Imperial Guards arrived to interrogate a notorious bandit—an ordinary occurrence, yet their numbers raised eyebrows. The prison guards asked no questions. During the shift change, the Guards entered unimpeded.

The underground prison sprawled vast, prisoners caged every five paces beneath strict discipline. The Guards marched deep inside where a planted criminal—charged with murder, robbery, and attempted assassination of officials—had been placed near Magistrate Cao’s cell. Instead of retrieving him, they lingered.

As Blade Guards began their shift change, some Guards escorted the decoy prisoner out while others slipped to Cao’s cell. The magistrate sat listlessly, awaiting death. When his door clanged open, he barely turned to see Imperial Guards bearing hemp ropes.

They looped a rope through a high ventilation grate’s iron bars. Cao offered no resistance as they hoisted him up. Choking, his vision darkened—yet in death’s throes, clarity struck: Cao Di, his sole heir, must survive. He thrashed suddenly, but the neck yoke’s weight immobilized him.

Chapter 4955: Mission Failed

“Alert! Someone’s hanging!” The shout came as patrolling guards chanced upon the scene. The fleeing Imperial Guards abandoned Cao, now gasping as rescuers cut him down.

“Who gave him rope?!” roared a Blade Guard captain. A trembling guard mentioned the Imperial Guards’ presence. Realization dawned: “Delay us outside while they murdered within! Seal the exits!”

Chaos erupted. Guards swarmed, capturing fleeing Imperial agents after bloody clashes. Interrogated, Cao rasped, “Only Master Qin wants me dead. Inform His Majesty—I’ll expose the Qins’ crimes.”

When reported, the Emperor thundered, “Fools! You let assassins slip through?” After berating the Blade Guards, he summoned Minister Qi. “Why would Imperial Guards target Cao? Does Qi court death?”

Meanwhile, Cao, revived but broken, plotted his final move—to exonerate his son during trial. The Blade Guards tightened security, banning all visitors under penalty of death.

Chapter 4956: Flawed Reasoning

“Your Majesty, we never imagined Imperial Guards would turn traitor,” pleaded the Blade Guard commander. “They frequented the prison lately—clearly reconnaissance.”

The Emperor’s rage cooled slightly. “Summon Minister Qi! I’ll hear his excuses myself.” Turning to Cao’s message, he frowned. “Guard Cao fiercely. Let none approach. And prepare him for audience—I’ll hear what he claims about the Qins.”
