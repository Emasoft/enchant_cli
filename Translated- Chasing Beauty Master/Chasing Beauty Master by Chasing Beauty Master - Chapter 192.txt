“This is Xiao Liu’s sincere gesture. Refusing would embarrass him. You don’t need to attend to guests here—go keep Xiao Liu company. He’s new to City N and unfamiliar with many places. Take time to show him around.” Shao Guobang maintained his smile despite his deep dissatisfaction with his daughter Shao Dan’s behavior.

Today marked a pivotal moment for him—a promotion from an obscure clerk to vice president on his birthday. Even a pie falling from the sky couldn’t match this fortune. He resolved to secure this golden son-in-law at all costs.

Shao Dan bit her lip, silent. Her father was trading her for his career.

“I already have someone I love. Young Master Liu’s efforts will be wasted.” Seeing matters escalate, Shao Dan laid her cards bare to avoid deeper entanglement.

Liu Xing’s smile faltered.

**Chapter 475: Enough is Enough**

“What did you say? Repeat that!” Shao Guobang’s rage ignited.

“I said I have someone I love. Please don’t waste your efforts, Young Master Liu.” Shao Dan replied coolly.

“That gangster Luo Cheng?” Shao Guobang sneered.

“Yes, him. But don’t slander him—he has legitimate businesses. He’s no gangster.” Shao Dan corrected.

“Even so, how does he compare to Xiao Liu? I forbid this!” Shao Guobang glowered.

“Because he can’t further your career?” Shao Dan retorted bluntly.

“You—you’ll be the death of me!” Clutching his chest, he pointed accusingly.

“Uncle, calm yourself. Today’s your celebration—health comes first.” Liu Xing steadied Shao Guobang before turning to Shao Dan. “Don’t be fooled by appearances. My cousin confirmed Luo Cheng’s underworld ties.”

“Xiao Liu, you’re the only son-in-law I acknowledge.” Shao Guobang’s fondness for Liu Xing grew.

Liu Xing smirked triumphantly.

Shao Dan snorted. “Your roundabout tactics won’t work.”

“Luo Cheng, hear that? If we hadn’t come, would you know her feelings?” A voice cut through the crowd.

Shao Dan turned, cheeks flushing as she approached Luo Cheng. “When did you arrive? Why no warning?”

Luo Cheng stood grinning wordlessly.

Niu Le boomed, “We heard her confession! Respect to Sister-in-law—Luo’s got catching up to do!”

Shao Dan shot Luo Cheng an embarrassed glare.

Watching their exchange, Liu Xing’s smile vanished as he released Shao Guobang.

Sensing crisis, Shao Guobang barked at the newcomers: “Who are you? Leave or I’ll call security!”

Guan Yu chuckled mirthlessly. “We came to celebrate my brother’s future father-in-law.”

“Future father-in-law?” Shao Guobang seethed. “I’ll never accept a thug! My only son-in-law is Xiao Liu!”

Liu Xing smirked at Guan Yu.

Ignoring him, Guan Yu asked Shao Dan: “Do you consent?”

“My heart belongs to another. Let him abandon this delusion.” She glared.

Guan Yu turned to Liu Xing. “How shameless can you be? She rejects you yet you cling? Truly unprecedented.”

Liu Xing darkened. “Apologize now.”

Before Guan Yu responded, Niu Le exploded.

“Apologize my ass!” The burly man charged, kicking Liu Xing’s abdomen. “Stealing Luo’s girl then acting high-and-mighty? I’ll stomp your face!”

Liu Xing crumpled under Niu Le’s assault.

“Security! Call security!” Shao Guobang panicked but kept distance from the raging Niu Le.

Shao Dan frowned at Luo Cheng. “Aren’t your friends too reckless?”

As an officer, this crossed her principles.

Luo Cheng glanced at Guan Yu—the group’s apparent leader.

Guan Yu stretched lazily. “Let Niu vent. I’m sick of meddlers in my brother’s happiness.”

Eight security thugs arrived, brandishing batons. Before contact, Guan Yu hurled a chair—sending three flying. Within moments, all eight lay unconscious.

“Boss Liu keeps useless trash.” Guan Yu dusted his hands.

The crowd gaped. Eight enforcers subdued in seconds!

“Who dares cause trouble here?!” A gruff voice roared as the crowd parted.

**Chapter 476: Know Your Place**

Boss Liu stormed in, freezing when recognizing Niu Le and Guan Yu. His rage turned to forced calm.

“Niu, enough.” Guan Yu smiled coldly.

Liu Xing scrambled to Boss Liu. “Cousin! They disrespected you! Make them pay!”

Boss Liu’s eye twitched. “Apologize. Now.”

Stunned, Liu Xing obeyed. Guan Yu sneered: “Remember this lesson. Overstep again, consequences worsen.”

After placating Guan Yu, Boss Liu offered free catering for the event before retreating.

The stunned crowd buzzed as Guan Yu nudged Luo Cheng: “Clear your path. Seize the moment.”

Niu Le thumped Luo Cheng’s back. “Man up! Propose already!”

Blushing, Luo Cheng knelt with a ring. “Shao Dan, be my girlfriend!”

**Chapter 477: Who Is He?**

The crowd erupted. “Say yes!”

Tearfully, Shao Dan extended her hand. Cheers filled the hall as Luo Cheng lifted her joyfully.

Only Shao Guobang sulked—his promotion dreams shattered. Confronted by Guan Yu later, he trembled: “I-I don’t look down on Luo Cheng!”

“You do.” Guan Yu pierced through his pretense. “But remember—your daughter’s happiness outweighs ambition. Cross Luo Cheng, and you cross me.”

Shao Guobang swallowed hard, finally comprehending the power dynamics. The celebration continued, now free of shadows.
