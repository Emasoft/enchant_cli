The Misfit erupted in fury, “Go to hell! What kind of shoddy casino is this? I’ll smash this dump today! You think you can mess around? Screw your mother’s games! I’m done playing, and none of you bastards will play either!” Channeling all his strength, he flipped the massive gambling table before him.

The enormous table, heavy and imposing, crashed to the ground with a thunderous clang, scattering chips, drinks, and debris everywhere.

“Brothers, come here!” the Misfit roared. “Damn it all—smash everything! Tear this place apart!”

The five or six men accompanying him rushed over. One asked urgently, “Brother Mei, what happened?”

Seething, the Misfit bellowed, “Two measly servers dared insult members of the Yu Gang! Wreck this place! Let’s see them mock the Yu Gang again!”

The men suddenly remembered their assumed identities as Yu Gang members. Fueled by the gang’s fearsome reputation, they hurled themselves into destruction—overturning tables, smashing chairs, attacking anyone in their path.

**Chapter 2710: Provoking Me Deliberately**

Led by the Misfit, the group wreaked havoc on the casino’s second floor, plunging the venue into chaos.

Xiao Mu, watching from a corner, smirked and vanished into the crowd.

Ma Tong’s assistant, alerted by the commotion, rushed upstairs with reinforcements. Seeing the vandalism, he spat, “These scumbags dare cause trouble here?” Behind him stood the hulking figures of Giant Ox and Leopard.

“Don’t let them escape!” the assistant shouted. “Capture them!”

At Leopard’s nod, over twenty men surged forward, swiftly subduing the Misfit and his crew.

When Ma Tong arrived, his face twisted in rage at the sight of shattered tables—luxurious furnishings now ruined. “What happened?” he growled.

A bloodied server staggered over. “Boss, these men claim to be from the Yu Gang. They started smashing things and injured guests!”

“The Yu Gang? Again?” Ma Tong hurled his cigar to the ground. The Misfit and his men, now beaten and restrained, knelt bruised and swollen under heavy guard.

Glowering, Ma Tong demanded, “Yu Gang, huh? Did Guan Yu send you?”

The Misfit, though pinned, blustered, “Y-yes! Touch us, and our boss will destroy you!”

“Arrogant worms!” Ma Tong snarled. “The Yu Gang thinks they’re invincible? Ruining my business twice? Beat them senseless!”

Under a storm of kicks and punches, the men wailed. Ma Tong’s fury mounted—his grand opening had become a nightmare.

Bill Lin and Fang Su arrived, feigning shock. “Ma,” Bill exclaimed, “what happened? I step away briefly and—”

“Guan Yu’s dogs sabotaged me again!” Ma Tong spat. “I’ll slaughter these rats and dump them at his doorstep!”

Bill feigned concern. “Killing them now would be unwise. Keep them alive as evidence. Let’s confront Guan Yu directly!”

Ma Tong relented, halting the beating. The Misfit, barely conscious, croaked, “Xiao Mu… help…”

Ignored, he slumped as Bill whispered to Ma Tong, “Let’s march to Guan Yu’s estate. Force him to answer!”

**Chapter 2711: As Expected**

A convoy of fifty vehicles snaked toward Qiaoyuan District. Bill, riding shotgun in Fang’s BMW, texted a casino waitress while humming.

“With Ma Tong against him,” Fang remarked, “Guan Yu’s days are numbered. Ma’s influence runs deeper than it seems.”

Bill grinned. “A sleeping giant awakened. Let’s see Guan Yu withstand three hundred enraged men.”

At Guan Yu’s compound, guards tensed as the mob arrived. Ma Tong’s men dumped the battered Misfit crew at the gates.

Guan Yu emerged casually from his mansion, flanked by Xue Jing. “Ma Tong,” he greeted, “heard your casino opened today. Business booming?”

“Enough games!” Ma Tong snapped. “Your men wrecked my property—twice! Explain yourself!”

Bill interjected, “Stop lying, Guan Yu! These are your thugs!”

Guan Yu checked his watch. “Odd—I hear a buzzing fly.” Turning to Ma Tong, he said, “These aren’t my men. Check our registry.”

Wei Hongwei produced four ledgers. “Every Yu Gang member is documented—photos, IDs, enrollment dates. Find these imposters here.”

The ledgers revealed no match. Ma Tong’s rage wavered. Bill seethed silently as Guan Yu smirked. The trap had sprung.
