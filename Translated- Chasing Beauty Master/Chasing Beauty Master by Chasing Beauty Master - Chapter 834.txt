After hearing Feng Xihu's words, Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo stood behind Guan Yu, exchanging glances that revealed mutual astonishment. Wei Hongwei thought inwardly, *The boss sneaked into a girl's residence at night? I thought only I’d do something like that! With all the beauties around him, why provoke Feng Xihu?*

Silently signaling Jia Bo to retreat, the two quietly slipped away.

Feng Xihu’s accusation left Guan Yu speechless. Any further denial would make him less than a man. Cao Jin, noticing the commotion, brightened upon spotting Feng Xihu. *Damn, she’s stunning! How’d I miss such a beauty in our area? She rivals even Yang Conghan!*

Feng Xihu’s allure lay partly in her towering height. Cao Jin drifted toward Guan Yu, scheming to seize an opportunity with this goddess.

*Fuck! Why does every beauty have ties to Guan Yu? Maybe she just accidentally bumped his car.* Cao Jin fantasized: If she truly caused a minor accident, he’d gallantly resolve it, earn her gratitude, secure a dinner date, and then...well, everyone knew the drill.

Guan Yu remained silent. That night, he’d indeed been wrong—sneaking a peek while she used the bathroom and groping her. Scratching his head, he felt trapped as Feng Xihu gripped his sleeve.

“It was a misunderstanding. Must you push so hard?” Guan Yu pleaded.

“A *misunderstanding*? Of all rooms in the vast Feng estate, you barged into mine to spy? Don’t play innocent!” Feng Xihu retorted fiercely.

Defeated, Guan Yu sighed, “Fine. What do you want?”

Cao Jin strode over heroically. “Guan Yu! How dare you harass a lady?” He bowed gallantly to Feng Xihu, stealing glances at her jade-like hands, flawless face, and curves. His heart raced. Her porcelain skin seemed painted—flawless as eggshell.

“A minor traffic accident? Even if this beauty hit your car, I’ll cover the repairs. No need to bully her,” Cao Jin declared.

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. Repairing both cars—his and Pan Taisheng’s borrowed one—would cost a fortune. Though money wasn’t an issue, free help was welcome. Smirking, he said, “Generous today, Cao? Let’s say...¥150,000 for repairs. Give me ¥200,000 now. I’ll ask for more if needed.”

Cao Jin stiffened. *Bastard!* But recognizing the luxury cars, he gritted his teeth. *¥200,000 for this goddess? Worth it.*

“Deal. I’m known for decisiveness.” Cao Jin handed over a card. “Here’s ¥200,000. Don’t waste the lady’s time.”

“Thanks, Cao. Since you want me gone, I’ll leave.” Guan Yu pocketed the card.

Feng Xihu exploded. “Stop!” She seized Guan Yu again.

“Cao wants me gone. What choice do I have?” Guan Yu shrugged.

“This trash pollutes the air,” Cao Jin simpered. “I’ll get top mechanics to restore your car perfectly.”

“**Scram!**” Feng Xihu’s roar stunned Cao Jin.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Careful, Cao. Your weak heart can’t handle shocks.”

“Did I offend you?” Cao Jin sputtered.

“Are you deaf? **Get lost!**” Feng Xihu turned to Guan Yu. “You’re not escaping today. I’m sticking to you!”

Baffled but composed, Cao Jin warned, “Don’t trust this scoundrel, beauty.”

Guan Yu muttered, “Adding fuel to fire.” Feng Xihu’s obsession had already rooted him in her heart—even haunting her dreams. Cao Jin’s insults only inflamed her.

“Who’s this riffraff? **I said SCRAM!**” She jabbed a finger at Cao Jin’s nose.

Humiliated before onlookers, Cao Jin snapped. “You’ll regret this!” He beckoned thugs to seize her.

Guan Yu intervened. “A friendly warning: She’s Feng Xihu, the Feng heiress. Your call.”

Cao Jin paled. The Fengs—one of the four great clans—weren’t to be trifled with. Yet backing down publicly would ruin his reputation.

Guan Yu offered an out. “A misunderstanding, Cao. The Fengs will compensate you.”

Cao Jin forced a smile. “I’m civilized. Let’s forget this.” He left, seething. *Bitch! I’ll make you pay.*

Feng Xihu clung to Guan Yu. “Release me. Everyone’s watching,” he urged.

“No! You’ll vanish again.” Her voice softened, tinged with a Taipei lilt.

As crowds swelled, Feng Xihu discarded dignity. “You spied on me, groped me—**take responsibility!**”

Gasps erupted. “Beast!” “Scum!” spectators jeered.

Guan Yu leaned into infamy. “True! I’m trash. Why let her marry me? A flower on dung!”

The mob agreed. “Don’t ruin her life!”

Feng Xihu fumed. “**Stay out of it!**”

A vibrant voice cut through—Lan Yu, in red cosplay, pushed forward. “Guan Yu! Are you hurt?”

Seizing a distraction, Guan Yu cried, “I spied on **her** last night!”

Lan Yu blushed. “Really?”

Feng Xihu glared as men rallied. “Beat this pervert!”

“**Back off!**” Feng Xihu shielded Guan Yu. “I choose him!”

Lan Yu, confused but smitten, beamed. The crowd’s fury crescendoed until Feng Xihu’s ferocity scattered them.

Amid chaos, Guan Yu sighed. *Kindness is a curse.*
