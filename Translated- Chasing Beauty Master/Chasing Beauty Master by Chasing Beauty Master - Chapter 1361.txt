Wang Xiaorong now truly wished she could slap Xiao Zhi to death. How dare he spout such nonsense! She protested indignantly, "You're utterly heartless! Just moments ago, you were discussing using me as a shield against the Demon Soul Sect, claiming I'd protect your lives. Now that some pretty little thing appears, you cast me aside? Is this how you righteous people conduct yourselves?"

Xiao Zhi flushed with embarrassment under her accusation. She wasn't wrong. "Haha, my apologies," he chuckled awkwardly. "That was a momentary lapse in judgment. I misspoke."

"What's really going on here?" Cui Hua asked Guan Yu, her jade-green eyes narrowing. "Does the Demon Soul Sect seek to collaborate with you too?"

"Collaborate?" Guan Yu shook his head. "The Demon Soul Sect has brought overwhelming force today. They need no allies."

"Then why is she here?" Cui Hua's voice carried a barely concealed edge of pain. "Don't tell me she's simply pining for your company." Though she maintained composure, the unspoken truth lingered - Guan Yu's brilliance made him unattainable, destined for greater things beyond her reach.

"I kept her here," Guan Yu stated bluntly. "Facing the Demon Soul Sect's numerical superiority, we planned to enter Duobao Mountain with Wang Xiaorong as our hostage. At least this way, we might escape with our lives when confronting their forces."

Cui Hua's eyebrows shot up. This tale stretched credibility beyond reason - the Demon Soul Sect's Young Mistress aiding Yunqing Sect members against her own? Even street beggars wouldn't swallow such nonsense.

Yet coming from Guan Yu, she had to consider it. "This sounds utterly fantastical," she said skeptically. "Has the Young Mistress taken ill?"

"Indeed I have!" Wang Xiaorong declared with perverse pride. "My sickness is called devotion to Guan Yu! You two may claim deep affection, but what sacrifices have you made? I'd move mountains for him!"

Cui Hua forced a smile. "Sister Liu sent me to discuss collaboration regarding the Eight-Drum Technique."

"Collaborate?" Guan Yu's eyes sharpened. "Your Guaiyao Cave forces outnumber us four-to-one. The Eight-Drum Technique isn't cabbages at a market stall - there's little to share between us."

His meaning hung clear - with countless lives already lost over this coveted technique, what possible alliance could exist between Guaiyao Cave and their small group?

"Sister Liu proposes this," Cui Hua explained. "Should we cooperate, Guaiyao Cave will relinquish the Eight-Drum Technique to you upon obtaining it."

Guan Yu's skepticism deepened. "Such generosity? When West Willow has coveted this technique for decades? What's the true price?"

Cui Hua sighed. "Sister Liu knows we can't withstand the Demon Soul Sect alone. While desiring the technique, our greater fear is it falling into the Demon Lord's hands. Should he obtain it, our destruction would be imminent. Better anyone claim it than him."

Guan Yu nodded slowly. West Willow's desperation became clear - this was less collaboration than damage control. The technique's loss paled against the catastrophe of the Demon Lord's ascension.

Cui Hua pressed on, "Now that we have the Young Mistress here, we could present her to Azure Dragon Envoy. The technique would be ours for certain!"

Gasps filled the room. Even Guan Yu stared in shock at the audacious suggestion. Wang Xiaorong scoffed, "Try capturing me then! Let's see your skills match your boldness!"

"Guan Yu, this is our golden opportunity!" Cui Hua urged, knowing her own limitations. "Why hesitate?"

Guan Yu's voice turned glacial. "Collaboration with West Willow is one matter. Taking hostages makes us no better than demonic cultivators. Where then lies our righteousness?"

Cui Hua threw up her hands. "Your righteous principles baffle me! Have it your way then."

"Many paths remain," Guan Yu countered. "Tell me truthfully - does West Willow seek to use me as her blade against the Demon Soul Sect? After we weaken each other, she'd swoop in for the kill?"

Cui Hua's protest died as Guan Yu continued, "Guaiyao Cave's women are never simple, least of all the Demoness Sisters. West Willow would sooner flee to remote corners than willingly surrender the technique to me."

Chapter 3521: Explaining the Situation

"Moreover," Guan Yu fabricated smoothly, "Yunqing reinforcements arrive tomorrow. We'll await them rather than charge blindly to our deaths tonight."

Xiao Zhi caught on instantly, supporting the lie while poor Aze blurted, "But Elder Zheng never mentioned—"

"Need I consult you on every decision?" Guan Yu cut him off sharply, flashing a warning glance.

As Cui Hua removed her veil, revealing astonishing beauty that promised future greatness, Wang Xiaorong snapped, "Then leave! No one's keeping you."

After Cui Hua's departure, Aze puzzled aloud, "Reinforcements? Since when—"

"Fool!" Xiao Zhi cuffed him. "That was theater for West Willow's ears! To make her think we're not alone!"

Wang Xiaorong burst into laughter. "Even I believed that act! You righteous fools have your uses!"

Guan Yu massaged his temples. This fabrication served dual purposes - protecting Wang Xiaorong's position while keeping Guaiyao Cave's ambitions in check. With Yunqing's "impending forces," West Willow would think twice before acting rashly.

Chapter 3522: My Fear

As midnight deepened, Wang Xiaorong's stomach growled theatrically. "Guan Yu! I'm starving! Where's the food?"

"Let's check the kitchens," Guan Yu sighed, rising. To Xiao Zhi: "Fetch water."

"I'll help!" Wang Xiaorong bounded up, clinging to Guan Yu's arm. "I might get bullied if left alone!"

The sprawling compound's shadows seemed to swallow them whole. "It's so dark..." Wang Xiaorong whispered, genuine fear creeping into her voice. "What if we get lost?"

Taking the water jug, Guan Yu drew her close. "Better?" His arm around her shoulders radiated warmth against the chill night. "You'll catch cold dressed like this."

Bathed in moonlight, Wang Xiaorong's smile outshone the stars. "Not cold anymore. Not scared. Guan Yu... you're wonderful."

The moment's sweetness soured as Guan Yu recalled another spirited girl who'd once clung to him thus - Blue Jade, with her tempestuous affections. How similar they were, these fiery women who burned too bright for ordinary lives.

As they navigated the labyrinthine estate, Guan Yu pondered the coming storm. West Willow's machinations, the Demon Lord's ambitions, and this unpredictable girl beside him - all pieces in a deadly game where the Eight-Drum Technique was merely the opening move.
