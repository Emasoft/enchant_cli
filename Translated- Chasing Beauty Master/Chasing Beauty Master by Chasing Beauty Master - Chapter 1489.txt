Seated on a chair, Yan Zhao unwrapped the bandages around his ankle to reveal a swollen joint resembling a steamed bun. The sight of the festering wound with its gaping hole made even him flinch. Over the past days, the throbbing pain had been relentless. Now that the constricting cloth strips were removed, blood rushed back to the numbed area, reigniting a fresh wave of agony.

Gritting his teeth, Yan Zhao moistened a cloth to gently clean the injury. Fearing water exposure might worsen the rot, he dabbed cautiously despite the sweat dripping from his brow. After two excruciating hours, he finally finished tending the wound. Changing into fresh clothes, he set out to locate the Demon Lord through persistent inquiries.

In this lawless den of the Demonic Soul Sect, information came at a price. Fortunately, Yan Zhao had brought all the silver he'd hoarded during his days at Cloud Azure Sect. A few coins loosened tongues here—proof that survival in this den required wealth as much as strength. How ironic that the once-sought-after Cloud Azure disciple now paid for scraps of attention.

**Chapter 3881: Do You Have Confidence?**

The Demon Lord's chamber reeked of intrigue. Three-Heads, standing guard, blinked in surprise at Yan Zhao's entrance. "Yan Zhao? What brings you—"

"Perhaps you're unaware," the Demon Lord interrupted with a chuckle that echoed like grinding stones, "but Brother Yan has been our loyal informant for years."

Ignoring Three-Heads' probing stare, Yan Zhao knelt stiffly. "My Lord, I beg your aid in healing this injury." His voice tightened as the wound pulsed in reminder.

"Rise. Wait by the wall," the Demon Lord dismissed, turning back to Three-Heads. "Your thoughts on the scouts' report? Are you prepared?"

Three-Heads' mind churned. The bamboo forest ambush—Guan Yu's capture, the murdered farmers—all pointed to Yan Zhao's handiwork during a blood-poisoning episode. Yet why spare Guan Yu? The inconsistency nagged him. "Forgive my doubt, Lord. Though the Red Lotus Sect's young are mediocre, their elders remain formidable. The Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Lotus..."

"Six-Headed Wolf King was your kin before becoming my ally," the Demon Lord countered. "Retrieve the Wanxiang Plate from his prison, and you free us both. The Fire Gu I procured will shield you from the ice qi." He produced a jade amulet carved like a flaming insect—legendary ward against frostbite.

Three-Heads traced old scars. Two decades prior, he'd barely escaped that glacial hell after a guard's surprise attack ruined his rescue attempt. The memory of qi-depletion and that desperate bluff with a fake artifact still chilled his bones. "Even with the Gu... The time window is—"

"One incense stick's worth between alarm and Sun Lianzi's arrival," the Demon Lord finished. "Take a distraction. Yan Zhao here," he gestured to the limping figure, "could prove useful once healed."

Yan Zhao seized the opportunity. "When my leg mends, I'll assist!" This was his chance to cement worth in the sect that now offered his only refuge.

**Chapter 3882: Dead Weight**

Three-Heads' lip curled. Useful? The Cloud Azure traitor reeked of desperation. Yet the Demon Lord was already examining the festering wound. "Strange injury. No venom, yet it refuses to heal. Foreign object lodged within?"

"Excise it," Three-Heads said tersely, savoring Yan Zhao's flinch. Let the blade bite deep, he thought. But professional duty overrode malice. "The flesh must be opened. A lengthy recovery."

The Demon Lord snapped his fingers. "Ah! Our 'Medical Immortal' should handle this." He thrust a scalpel toward Three-Heads.

Suppressing a scowl, Three-Heads approached. Yan Zhao's rapid breathing betrayed fear. How satisfying to watch the proud disciple squirm. Yet as fingers probed the swollen flesh, he frowned. The wound's heat suggested more than simple infection—a buried mystery waiting to be carved out.
