“Hurry up, Sister Xiaorong! It seems we’ll have roasted meat tonight. My stomach has been protesting nonstop,” Qiqi said with a smile.

Wang Xiaorong cast a wind-element spell, sweeping away every fallen leaf around them—even stripping the trees bare—to prevent the campfire from igniting the entire forest. The cleared area now allowed them to light a fire safely.

Guan Yu hacked away with his Soulfall Blade, chopping a fallen tree into firewood and hauling back even the thickest trunks. He mused that if he were a lumberjack, he’d have quite the talent for it.

Once the fire crackled to life, the group descended from the trees and gathered around it. Two plump wild pheasants roasted above the flames. Though lacking seasoning, the promise of a full stomach was blessing enough.

**Chapter 5121: Now You Know Isn’t Too Late**

Duan Ruxue sat motionless and silent. From their departure in the capital to this desolate moment, she’d never imagined such a fate.

Coddled her entire life, she’d never endured hardship. This journey’s relentless trials—now even a proper resting place denied—left her reeling.

The charred food seemed unhygienic, but hunger left no choice. What began as a quest for treasure had spiraled into an ordeal.

“Who knows how long it’ll take to find the East Sea… or return home,” Duan Ruxue murmured suddenly.

Qiqi, ever cheerful, sliced off a pheasant leg and handed it to her. “Stop overthinking! This leg smells heavenly—I’m drooling! Here, eat up!”

The roasted pheasant lacked flavor without spices, but they ate gratefully. Duan Ruxue bit fiercely into her portion, knowing sustenance meant strength to press onward—and eventually, home.

“This isn’t so bad,” Guan Yu said. “Don’t dwell on the rest. When we’ll return? None can say. This might be your first taste of adversity, but you’ll adapt—next time, you’ll handle it smoothly.”

“What if we retrieved the tents left on that mountain?” Duan Ruxue suggested. “At least we’d have shelter.”

“Walk all that way back? No chance!” Qiqi retorted.

Despite the chill, the roaring fire warmed them. Five people devoured two pheasants completely—Qiqi eating the most.

Guan Yu gestured to the fire. “Rest against the trees tonight. I’ll keep watch. Recover your strength—tomorrow demands it.”

As logs promised to burn till dawn, Jiang Yuanhai observed, “Notice how the East Sea Dragon Pearl glows brighter here?”

“If its light intensifies near the East Sea, tracking it could guide us,” he continued. “Following its glow might lead us straight there.”

Qiqi clung to her Celestial Sword, cherished since slaying the wolf pack. She peered at the pearl. “But it shone brightest at the chasm’s edge earlier.”

Jiang Yuanhai frowned. “True… Does that mean the chasm is closest to the East Sea? Yet we found no ruins along the way.”

“Perhaps the pearl’s brightness isn’t purely distance-related,” Guan Yu said. “Its glow might signal something else entirely. We lack answers.”

Debate persisted, though Jiang Yuanhai remained convinced: the pearl’s radiance tied directly to the East Sea.

“If brightness indicates proximity,” he mused, “could the East Sea lie *beneath* the chasm?”

“Impossible!” Duan Ruxue objected. “The East Sea Town ruins should be nearby. With time, we’ll uncover them.”

Qiqi skipped to Guan Yu’s side. “Guan Yu, can I sleep leaning on your shoulder?”

“Of course,” he smiled.

Wang Xiaorong silently claimed his other shoulder. Duan Ruxue watched enviously—how she longed for such comfort in this bleakness.

Seizing the moment, she asked, “Brother Wan… may I ask something?”

“My real name?” Guan Yu guessed. At her nod, he continued, “I’m Guan Yu, disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect. I used ‘Wan Hong’ as an alias in the capital. Now you know.”

Duan Ruxue turned to Jiang Yuanhai. “You knew his true identity all along?”

“Yes,” Jiang Yuanhai admitted. “In the capital, only I did.”

“Even Chu Fan was unaware,” Guan Yu added.

“No wonder!” Duan Ruxue exclaimed. “I heard Qiqi call you ‘Guan Yu’ but thought it a nickname. After seeing your powers… I’ve wanted to ask.”

“Better late than never,” Guan Yu chuckled. “A name’s just a name. Knowing the person matters.”

“Then… should I call you Brother Guan now?” she teased. Despite the cold wind, warmth lingered among them.

**Chapter 5122: Descent Into the Chasm**

The next morning, Jiang Yuanhai pressed his theory. “Brother Guan, take the pearl and scout by air. Note where it glows brightest—especially near the chasm.”

“Understood,” Guan Yu said. Turning to Wang Xiaorong, he instructed, “Guard everyone here. Erect protective shields until I return.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded. Armed with Soulfall Blade and Dragon Pearl, Guan Yu soared off.

Upon returning sweat-drenched, Jiang Yuanhai pounced: “Well?”

“You were right,” Guan Yu confirmed. “The pearl blazed brightest at the chasm’s edge. Nowhere else matched it—not even Mount Pagoda.”

“This confirms it!” Jiang Yuanhai exulted. “The chasm holds answers! The Dragon Pearl’s reaction suggests the East Sea lies below!”

Guan Yu proposed descending further. “But the depths lack oxygen. We’ll need preparation.”

After crafting torches (later deemed useless without air), Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong prepared to plunge again.

“Stay vigilant,” Guan Yu told Qiqi. “Protect Jiang and Duan Ruxue.”

Hand in hand, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong leapt into the abyss.

**Chapter 5123: Pursuit**

Darkness engulfed them, broken only by the Dragon Pearl’s glow. As they descended, breathing grew labored.

“Hold your breath from here,” Guan Yu advised. They inhaled deeply and dove.

Wind roared upward, resisting their drop. A barrier halted them until Guan Yu channeled Soulfall Blade’s energy to breach it.

Finally, they landed on a sandy shore. Before them stretched an underground sea, vast and eerily lit. The Dragon Pearl vibrated fiercely in Guan Yu’s grip.

“Can this be… the East Sea?” Guan Yu whispered. “Who’d believe it lurked in this abyss?”

Behind them loomed a cavernous mountain; ahead, waves crashed on rocks. As they marveled, a familiar voice echoed:

“Thank you, Guan Yu, for leading us to the subterranean East Sea. Without your efforts, none would’ve found it.”

The Demon Lord emerged from shadows, flanked by his Left and Right Envoys. The truth struck Guan Yu—they’d been tracked all along, their pursuit culminating here.
