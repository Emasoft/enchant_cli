With the formidable financial backing of the Bier family, the Feng family's southern stronghold had long been secured. This entire scheme had been orchestrated by Bier Lin to assist Young Master Feng.

The final 10% of stocks ostensibly acquired by the Bier family were merely a facade to convince outsiders of the irrevocable rift between the Bier and Feng families.

Reflecting now, Guanyu realized his oversight. Bier He, who once owed the Feng family a life-saving debt, would never have allowed such a sudden betrayal—even if Bier Lin had demanded Feng Xihu's compliance. He had underestimated their bond.

"Has Bier Lin been aiding your family in plotting this scheme all along?" Guanyu demanded.

Feng Xihu nodded obediently.

"Then you all knew when I went to retrieve fingerprints from the family head's room. Every word you spoke to me was deliberate, wasn't it?"

She nodded again, then shook her head like a wronged child. "Guanyu, I... I had no choice. But not everything I told you was false." Tears streamed down her face as she spoke.

"Was the family head's illness also a lie?"

"No! Father truly fell ill—he's been burning with fever." Though Guanyu's instincts urged him to trust her, doubt lingered.

"Tell me everything else you've hidden. Now." Time pressed urgently—dawn approached, and snipers would soon gain clear sightlines. Escape would become impossible.

Feng Xihu stood deliberately before him, shielding his silhouette from the snipers. Though the windows were bulletproof, high-caliber rifles could pierce them like tofu.

"It began when Father and I visited the Bier residence. Bier He was absent, and Bier Lin indeed made those infamous demands. After our return, Father collapsed. When Bier He learned of this, he reprimanded Bier Lin, who then brought ten billion to collaborate with my brother."

"Through Bier Lin's investigations, they discovered your interest in our family's Wannian Moyu. They restructured the southern building's layout, anticipating your arrival. The guards pretended to sleep per plan. Even our conversation during your visit to Father's room was staged."

"Your accomplice left unimpeded—we hoped to trap you in the vault. But you escaped. Most forces outside are Bier family reinforcements, including the firearms."

Guanyu glanced at the box in his hands. "And this?"

"It's empty. The true Wannian Moyu was relocated long ago." Opening it confirmed her words—nothing but hollow space.

**Chapter 2192: The Best Reason**

Guanyu cursed his underestimation—not of Feng's dissipated heir, but of Bier Lin's cunning. The scheme's perfection surpassed anything the pleasure-seeking young master could devise.

The Fengs had turned their failed plea to the Biers into an elaborate trap, exploiting Guanyu's pursuit of Wannian Moyu. Remarkably, Bier Lin had uncovered this closely guarded secret—known only to Guanyu and his confidante Jinhua.

"Was this your design?" Guanyu locked eyes with Feng Xihu. Silent confirmation passed between them—she had conceived the plot, refined by Bier Lin.

The feud's origins traced to Young Master Feng's rivalry over a woman, dismissed by Bier Lin as insufficient motive. His investigation revealed the true prize—Wannian Moyu. Memories surfaced of Yang Conghan's near-sacrifice, when only the Jiezun Sheli's power saved her from becoming Feng's servant.

Now, with Feng Xihu's betrayal complete, the transferred relic left Guanyu empty-handed. Dawn's approach demanded immediate escape—yet using Feng Xihu as hostage, though effective, repelled him. Her status as the family's treasured daughter and Bier Lin's obsession made her perfect leverage, but Guanyu's pride and lingering distrust stayed his hand.

"Will you never trust me?" Her tear-filled eyes held his gaze.

"Give me reason to." He hurled the empty box aside. "Leave. Do you think they can easily capture me?"

"You must take me hostage! They won't shoot—"

"Your departure would be reason enough." Her tears fell anew at his words, icy droplets striking his cheek as she fled.

**Chapter 2193: Direct Confrontation**

"Xihu's out!" Bier Lin's shout echoed through the surveillance room. Young Master Feng, foot bandaged, began issuing orders until a call interrupted—a screen revealed Ganbiri pressing a dagger to the family patriarch's throat.

"You harm him, I'll flay you alive!" Feng roared, watching his father's blood stain the sheets.

Ganbiri's voice crackled through: "Kill the floodlights."

As darkness engulfed the compound, chaos erupted. Guards murmured fears—of Guanyu's legendary prowess, of the brutal fate suffered by Sha Aman. Bier's armed men held steadier, but Feng's original guards wavered.
