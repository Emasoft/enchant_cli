“Many things don’t go as we wish. We must take it slow and not rush. I’ve made some progress deciphering the talismans here. Just give me more time,” Jinhua murmured warmly while nestled in Guanyu’s arms.

Previously, it had been Jinhua urgently pushing for revenge, constantly urging Guanyu. Now the tables had turned—Guanyu was the one eager to restore his cultivation. Only then could he match the Yang Family Patriarch’s strength. Without his powers, Guanyu stood no chance against a Realm Sovereign expert like the patriarch.

Jinhua, however, had grown less impatient. She knew Guanyu’s current vulnerability meant they couldn’t act recklessly. Caution was paramount.

Guanyu sighed. “The Yang Family remains quiet for now. I’ve been preoccupied with dealing with Bill Lin lately. I just didn’t want you to feel anxious.”

Living alone in this apartment, Jinhua often felt isolated and bored. Guanyu didn’t want to pressure her further—so long as she felt their plans were feasible, he would comply.

“With more time, our allies can gather strength. Our chances against the Yang Family will grow,” Jinhua said.

Though her words held truth, challenging the Yangs without overwhelming power was like throwing eggs at stones. The family’s dominance was absolute—let alone their vast network of minor factions, the patriarch alone stood as an invincible force.

“We can’t rush your affairs. I hope you’ll remain patient. Once my cultivation is restored, I’ll confront the Yang Patriarch directly and demand answers. That day will come—trust me,” Guanyu vowed.

“Of course I trust you. You’re the only one I can rely on,” Jinhua replied blissfully, clinging to his arm.

When Guanyu regained his peak Realm Sovereign strength, defeating the patriarch would be effortless. Yet that day’s arrival remained uncertain. Without his powers, opposing the Yangs was impossible. All hinged on waiting.

Guanyu added, “By the way, I recently met someone named Qi Zhi—a friend of a friend. He’s staying in this apartment complex, but his background is unclear. Stay alert.”

“Don’t worry. Even if he’s suspicious, it might just be coincidence. I rarely leave here—groceries get delivered. When I do go out, I disguise myself thoroughly. No one will recognize me,” Jinhua assured.

“Caution never hurts. Qi Zhi’s presence here isn’t accidental. He pretended not to know Ling’er earlier, yet acted shocked upon seeing her. I suspect someone planted him near our circle deliberately.”

Jinhua always heeded Guanyu’s warnings. She refused to become a burden. “I’ll be careful.”

“I’ve asked Brother Pan to investigate him. We’ll have answers soon.”

Guanyu decided to stay overnight, informing Xue Jing he’d be out with Second Only to Wolf. Relieved he had protection, she approved.

After dinner, boredom struck. Guanyu proposed, “Let’s stroll outside. Use your disguise tricks to transform us. What do you think?”

Thrilled, Jinhua nodded. “Wonderful! Wait while I gather supplies.”

She retrieved a large box from her vanity—filled with makeup and props. “Let’s pose as middle-aged spouses. Agreed?”

“Fine, but don’t make me too hideous,” Guanyu chuckled.

“The Golden Flower’s Great Transformation begins!” Jinhua declared, theatrically applying materials to his face.

Two hours later, they stood before a mirror—utterly unrecognizable. Guanyu remarked, “Astounding. Even my neighbors wouldn’t know me.”

Jinhua stifled laughter. His bushy beard obscured most facial features—a flawless disguise. “Proper aged clothing would perfect it,” she mused.

“This suffices,” Guanyu conceded.

Jinhua’s simpler disguise involved fake forehead wrinkles, a mask, and dowdy clothes. Arm in arm, they ventured out.

At the apartment gates, they encountered Pan Taisheng. Guanyu nearly greeted him before remembering his appearance. Pan glanced dismissively and entered the guardhouse.

“Brilliant! He didn’t recognize me!” Guanyu whispered, impressed.

“Of course! My skills aren’t for show,” Jinhua preened.

They headed toward bustling streets—a rare freedom for Guanyu, formerly restricted for safety. Now incognito, he relished the noisy crowds.

Jinhua clung to his arm, feigning marital bliss. “Husband, I want that giant sausage!” she cooed.

Guanyu stiffened momentarily at the term before playing along. “As my wife wishes.”

The vendor gave Jinhua a sidelong glance when she emphasized “biggest.” Guanyu recognized the innuendo but dismissed it—their disguises protected them.

Purchasing two sausages, Jinhua realized her mask prevented eating. “Let’s get a bag. Eat them later,” Guanyu suggested.

“But they’re best hot!” she pouted.

“We’ll microwave them.”

“Not the same!” Jinhua complained, though acquiesced.

Guanyu discreetly discarded his half-eaten sausage while she dragged him toward a commotion. A crowd had gathered ahead.

“Let’s investigate!” Jinhua urged, pulling him forward.

Pushing through the periphery, they heard shouts but saw nothing. Jinhua stood on tiptoes. “If only I were taller!”

**Chapter 2898: Spectacle**

“Ugh, I forgot my mask! Should’ve bought these later,” Jinhua grumbled.

Living in shadows complicated everything. Yang Family’s relentless hunt forced extreme caution—exposure meant death under the patriarch’s wrath.

“Better safe than sorry. The vendor might close later,” Guanyu reasoned.

“But reheating ruins the flavor! You just don’t appreciate food,” she teased.

Guanyu smirked. “Eat it in the public restroom then. Privacy guaranteed.”

“Disgusting!” She playfully swatted him.

Their affectionate bickering drew odd looks—unbecoming of their “middle-aged” personas. Jinhua stared longingly at her sausage.

“We’ll repurchase later if possible,” Guanyu compromised.

“You try some!” she insisted, noting his hesitation. “Rich people fuss too much. I eat these daily—perfectly healthy!”

Defiantly, Guanyu bit into the sausage. The savory aroma justified its popularity.

“One’s enough for me,” he said.

“Such a small appetite for a man!” she mocked.

“I watch my figure. Can’t become portly with so many ladies around.”

Jinhua narrowed her eyes. “With us beauties by your side, why care about looks? Planning to charm others?”

Guanyu changed subjects, spotting a gathering crowd. “Let’s see what’s happening.”

They squeezed toward the commotion, Jinhua straining to glimpse through the throng. “If only I were two meters tall!”

Guanyu chuckled, scanning for a better vantage point as curious onlookers buzzed around the unseen spectacle.
