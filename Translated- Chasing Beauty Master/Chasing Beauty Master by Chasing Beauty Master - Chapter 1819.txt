“However, the capital is indeed different from the outside world. If any trouble arises there that affects too many, I fear even our Demon Soul Sect may struggle to resolve it. After all, the capital teems with powerful figures.

Moreover, cultivators themselves are unwelcome in the capital. Once discovered, every step becomes a struggle, and the authorities won’t rest until they’ve dealt with you.”

“Rong’er,” came the patient voice, “this haste of yours won’t do. Guan Yu has only just arrived in the capital. Many matters remain unsettled, and the Left Envoy hasn’t even departed yet. Why the urgency? I say wait a few days until Guan Yu is properly settled. Then your journey won’t be too late.”

The Demon Lord’s words were pure delaying tactics—buying time day by day, allowing at least some preparation rather than this reckless rush.

Wang Xiaorong sat slouched in a nearby chair, tilting her head stubbornly. “No. I’m leaving for the capital today. Qiqi and I have packed everything. Send two avian envoys to escort us immediately.”

“Ah, all our avian envoys are occupied!” the Demon Lord exclaimed with feigned exasperation. “Between the affairs of Miao City and message deliveries, they’re stretched thin. Can’t you show some understanding, Rong’er?”

His refusal was deliberate. Wang Xiaorong had hoped to use the avian envoys’ swift flight to bypass arduous travel, but the Demon Lord had no intention of indulging her.

“Fine. If you won’t help, Qiqi and I will go alone.” Wang Xiaorong rose with finality, her resolve unshakable.

The Demon Lord stood hastily. “Rong’er, wait! Don’t act rashly. This isn’t some trivial matter!” He knew her penchant for trouble since childhood. Releasing her into the capital’s viper’s nest risked calamity.

Though cultivation sects—especially notorious ones like the Demon Soul Sect—commanded awe among commoners, the imperial authorities cared nothing for their reputation. Even major sects like the Demon Soul Sect and Azure Cloud Sect dared not provoke local officials lightly. The capital’s intricate web of power made accidental offenses perilous, and the government’s military might dwarfed any sect’s strength—a truth none could deny.

**Chapter 4760: Unease**

No cultivation sect, however formidable, could rival the imperial war machine. The capital’s guards, palace sentinels, and border legions of hundreds of thousands stood beyond any sect’s challenge.

“The Left Envoy hasn’t left yet,” the Demon Lord pressed. “I intend to send him but haven’t given orders. Why this impatience? Listen to me: wait a few days and travel with him. You’ll have protection.”

“I can’t wait. My bags are packed. I’m finding Guan Yu today—Qiqi and I will be fine,” Wang Xiaorong insisted.

“Child, think logically,” interjected the Right Envoy, siding with the Demon Lord. “Traveling now alone versus departing later with the Left Envoy’s avian escort—the arrival time differs little, yet you’d spare yourself a grueling journey. Use these days to prepare further.”

Wang Xiaorong’s agitation wavered. The envoy’s reasoning held merit: avian transport would save weeks of travel.

“Father, you swear you’ll send the envoys?” she demanded. Avian envoys—scarce, labor-intensive to train—were primarily reserved for urgent messages, their flight spells requiring immense spiritual power. Few masters would stoop to such messenger roles.

Trapped, the Demon Lord conceded, “I’ll arrange it. Wait here. With the Left Envoy accompanying you, I’ll rest easier.”

He knew retaining her was impossible. When Guan Yu had ventured to the desert, only fabricated seclusion demands had stalled her. Now, with Guan Yu in the capital, her departure was inevitable. Yet letting two young women travel alone risked disaster—the Demon Soul Sect’s enemies lurked everywhere. Only the Left Envoy’s escort would suffice.

“Two days,” Wang Xiaorong relented. “If nothing’s arranged by then, I leave regardless.” Her tone brooked no argument. That morning, news of Guan Yu’s solo departure from Azure Cloud Sect had spurred her and Qiqi to pack hastily, nearly fleeing before deciding to inform the Demon Lord.

The Right Envoy sighed. “A daughter grown is a daughter gone.” Though sect heir, Wang Xiaorong’s obsession with Guan Yu overrode all else.

Alone in the council hall, the Demon Lord resigned himself. If she must go, let her handle a certain capital matter—a task fitting her station.

**Chapter 4761: Revelry**

Two days later, Xiaomei returned to the desert while Guan Yu reached the capital for the second time. The city walls stood unchanged, though outer weeds grew denser.

Seeking lodging near the First Prince’s estate for easier coordination with Prince Zou, Guan Yu settled on an inn. His mission: locate the Eight-Sided Drum technique during the Snow-Capped Golden Hall event, certain the Demon Soul Sect already moved.

The capital’s sprawl teemed with life. Last visit had allowed no leisure; now Guan Yu intended to explore. Passing the First Prince’s austere residence, he noted listless guards and eerie quiet—unusual after the prince’s recent disaster relief efforts should have brought acclaim.

Finding no nearby inns in the desolate northwestern district, Guan Yu retreated to busier streets. The Second Prince’s thriving estate near the palace highlighted the First Prince’s marginalization.

To establish himself, Guan Yu resolved to blend in as a wealthy merchant—silver opened all doors here. A discreet business venture would mask his identity while cultivating influential connections for his Eight-Sided Drum hunt.

At midday, he surveyed the palace’s formidable defenses: concentric rings of guards, imperial troops, and rapid-response units made infiltration folly.

Amid bustling streets adorned with ornate carriages and palanquins, Guan Yu embraced the capital’s opulence. He’d play the affluent newcomer splendidly.

Visiting the property registry, he learned purchasing premises required navigating bureaucracy and “community representatives”—a hurdle easily cleared with bribes. A three-story compound with courtyard caught his eye, though its price staggered. Located between the palace and Second Prince’s estate, its value promised exponential growth if expansion plans materialized.

The agent’s spiel touted investment potential, but Guan Yu balked at the long-term gamble. Yet appearing established demanded assets. Learning the property doubled as an opera house, he explored auction alternatives.

**Chapter 4762: The Celebrity**

At Northern Gate’s Classical Auction House, Guan Yu faced his next challenge. A placard announced an imminent auction including his desired property. Approaching the entrance, a guard halted him: “Your pass?”

Observing attendees present wooden tokens, Guan Yu inquired about procurement. Before receiving an answer, commotion erupted behind him.

“Ah! The celebrity arrives!” the guard exclaimed, eyes alight.
