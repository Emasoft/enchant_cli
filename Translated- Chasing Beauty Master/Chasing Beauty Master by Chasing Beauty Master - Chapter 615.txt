Suddenly, Hong Feng raised his right hand, and a swirl of black mist materialized in his palm. Guan Yu stared at the ominous fog, a sense of foreboding tightening her chest. "What are you doing?!" she demanded, her voice trembling with newfound fear. Hong Feng grinned at the terror in her eyes. "Relax. This is just a... small reward," he said before thrusting the dark vapor into her body. Instantly, Guan Yu convulsed as excruciating pain erupted through her veins, her skin crawling as if ten thousand ants were gnawing at her flesh. A guttural scream tore from her throat. "Aaaagh!"

Writhing uncontrollably on the ground, she heard Hong Feng's detached voice above her: "This demon curse suppresses your powers. Survive the trials, and I'll lift it. Consider this motivation." He tossed the Soul-Devouring Whip at her feet. Guan Yu glared up through pain-blurred vision, teeth clenched. "I'll kill you... someday..." she vowed before darkness claimed her.

A figure materialized behind Hong Feng. "City Lord, why this cruelty?"

"Only hatred forges true strength," Hong Feng replied without turning. "She'll make an excellent pawn. More entertaining this way." With a flick of his robe, he vanished, leaving Ming to stare at Guan Yu's unconscious form. "Blame your own weakness," the man murmured, reaching for her.

A bestial snarl froze him mid-motion. Chi Mei, Guan Yu's spectral companion, materialized in a swirl of shadow, fangs bared. Ming cautiously raised empty palms. "Peace. I mean no—"

A razor-edged wind slash sliced the air before his face.

"Chi Mei, stand down!" The weak command came as Guan Yu staggered upright, charred robes clinging to her blistered skin. Retrieving her whip, she recalled the snarling spirit and limped past Ming without a glance. The retainer watched her receding figure, words of warning dying unspoken.

Alone on midnight streets, Guan Yu's small frame seemed swallowed by darkness. "Is this my fate?" she whispered to the uncaring wind. "To be forever manipulated? No!" Her fist clenched around the whip's hilt. "I'll carve my own path... even through his corpse."

Back in her quarters at Godslayer Residence, Guan Yu collapsed onto stiff bedding. "Chi Mei," she addressed the flickering shadow beside her, "do you believe in destiny?"

The spirit's glowing eyes narrowed. "Do you?"

Their simultaneous laughter held more defiance than mirth. Neither bowed to fate.

Dawn found them at the coliseum gates, crimson robes fluttering like bloodstained banners. With her powers shackled, survival seemed improbable—yet the pair strode forward.

"Xiu Luo?!" A sneering voice echoed as they entered. Before them loomed a humanoid demon, its barbed tail lashing. Guan Yu leveled her whip. "Begin."

The demon unleashed a torrent of black fire. Guan Yu's lash snapped like thunder, dispersing the flames. "Chi Mei—now!" The spirit lunged, only to recoil as protective flames engulfed their foe. Each strike Guan Yu landed healed instantly, the inferno regenerating faster than she could damage it.

High above, a crimson-clad observer smirked. "Can the Saint Sovereign's chosen handle this?"

Mocking laughter erupted from the fire-wreathed demon. "Struggling, Xiu Luo? Taste my Flame Vortex!" Twin firestorms erupted, herding Guan Yu and Chi Mei in desperate circles.

Nightfall brought no reprieve. Back at Godslayer Residence, Chi Mei's yowls pierced the darkness as Guan Yu relentlessly tested their combined abilities. "Enough!" the spirit finally howled, dodging a misaimed lightning bolt. "I'm not your training dummy!"

By dawn, Guan Yu marveled at her companion's hidden prowess—elemental mastery rivaling ancient beasts. Yet as she entered the arena alone (Chi Mei still nursing singed fur), her confidence wavered. Where was today's opponent?

Murmurs spread through demonic spectators. "Who dares shame us with cowardice?!"

A saccharine voice cut through tension. "Sorry I'm late, sister~!"

Guan Yu whirled to find a pink-haired child smiling innocently. Gasps rippled through the crowd. "Genius Demonic Honey! Dual-element prodigy!"

Beneath honeyed curls and frilled dresses, Guan Yu sensed lethal danger. "Are you Xiu Luo?" the child chirped, tilting her head. "Go easy on me, okay?"

The feigned sweetness shattered as Demonic Honey's hands morphed into bone claws. Guan Yu barely dodged, ribbons of blood staining her robes. Lightning followed before she could breathe. "Earth Evasion!" She plunged underground—only to erupt screaming as hellfire superheated the soil.

"Golden Arrows!" Guan Yu's counterattack dissolved under crackling electricity that left her twitching on scorched earth. "Chi Mei! Now!"

The spirit materialized, squinting at the scene. "Who roasted you? Serves you right!"

"Attack!"

Chi Mei gaped at their petite foe. "This brat did this?!"

Demonic Honey's eyes gleamed. "A spirit vessel! Give it to me!"

Guan Yu's answer came as a whip strike. "Dark Moon Scattering Clouds!" The arena darkened as Chi Mei merged with the lash, their combined assault driving Demonic Honey back. Yet Guan Yu's stamina waned—without Saint Sovereign power, sustaining the assault proved impossible.

"Chi Mei, hold on!" she mentally urged.

"Barely!" came the strained reply.

Summoning last reserves, Guan Yu ensnared the demon girl in whip coils. A crimson domain erupted—corrosive liquid melting stone beneath them. Demonic Honey's shrieks pierced the air as her legs dissolved to bone. "Mercy! I'm just a child!"

Guan Yu faltered. The piteous cries... that ruined body...

"Master, NO!" Chi Mei's warning came too late. Released, Demonic Honey teleported clear, charred lips twisting in a grin. "Die, Xiu Luo!"

Hellfire engulfed Guan Yu. Chi Mei's desperate patting couldn't smother flames eating through flesh. "How's this for repayment?" the demon girl crowed.

Emerging from cinders, half her face skeletal, Guan Yu rasped: "Chi Mei... kill her."

The spirit attacked with feral fury, but Demonic Honey's barrier held. A fireball nearly struck Chi Mei—until Guan Yu's whip intercepted it.

Panting, barely standing, Guan Yu met her foe's gaze. What stared back wasn't human, not demon—just raw, burning vengeance.
