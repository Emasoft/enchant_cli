Guan Yu slowly approached Ming Hanfeng and Tian Huanyun, an uncommon gentleness softening his features. “Brother, Mother, I’m home!” A long-absent smile blossomed on his face as he gazed at them. Ming Hanfeng jolted awake from his daze—this wasn’t a dream! She had truly returned! His lips unconsciously shaped her name: “Griffin!”

The familiar address drew a honeyed smile from her, radiant as a blooming snow lotus. Guan Yu threw herself into Ming Hanfeng’s embrace, breathing in his familiar scent. “Brother, I’m back. Griffin has returned!” Ming Hanfeng tightened his arms around her, voice trembling. “I know.”

Beside them, Tian Huanyun watched with tear-glazed eyes. “Yu’er, my child!” Guan Yu extricated herself from Ming Hanfeng’s hold and turned to Tian Huanyun with a bright grin. “Mother, have you been well?”

“Yes! Yes!” Tian Huanyun replied urgently, her child finally home. The assembled crowd stared in astonishment—the Queen’s daughter could only be the young prince who vanished six years ago!

Yet joy and sorrow walked hand in hand. Murong Qian glared bitterly at the reunited family. “Lion King! Why are you all standing there? Seize her for me!” Her shrieks fell on deaf ears. Before anyone could react, Ming Hanfeng’s glacial voice froze the air: “Who dares lay hands on her?”

Ye Wuhen stood dumbfounded—a prince of the Netherworld? Mu Bai gaped in shock. Since when did the Nether Realm have another prince? As Akalili regained his composure, his gaze met Guan Yu’s defiant stare. “Ahem... child, why have you returned?” His forced gentleness sickened her. “Imperial Father, shouldn’t Griffin return?” Her冷笑 carried biting sarcasm.

Akalili’s pupils contracted—that was the same look she’d worn six years ago when plunging into the abyss. Had six years truly changed her? Now she radiated danger.

Before Ming Hanfeng could speak, Guan Yu remarked coolly, “Ah, how forgetful of me. Didn’t my adoptive father wish for Yu’er to never return? Yet here I am!” Her self-mocking tone never wavered as she watched Akalili’s expression darken.

Ming Hanfeng clenched his fists at her bitter words—this time, I won’t abandon you. Ye Wuhen’s heart ached for Guan Yu—what had she endured? He silently vowed to protect her henceforth.

Akalili forced a chuckle. “How could that be?” Regardless of truth, he couldn’t let her disrupt the banquet. His glare warned her to desist, but Guan Yu sneered—six years ago this might have cowed her, but no longer. She ignored his threat entirely. “Indeed! Why would Imperial Father do such?” As Akalili’s face blackened, she added mockingly, “Ah, but I’ve brought no gift for Imperial Father’s feast!”

Tian Huanyun tugged her daughter’s hand in warning. Guan Yu reassured her with a glance while the crowd murmured—could the young prince’s disappearance six years ago involve the Nether King?

“This humble child has little to offer. Let me present these borrowed blossoms to Buddha.” A cascade of demon crystals materialized, drawing gasps. Akalili froze, dread rising as covetous eyes surrounded them. Ye Wuhen stared stunned.

“These were originally yours, Imperial Father. Let them serve as my tribute.” Guan Yu’s calm announcement left Akalili as dumbstruck as the others—so many demon crystals!

Guan Yu surveyed the greedy faces—exactly as planned. “Though worthless compared to the Spirit Pearl, they represent my sincerity.” Akalili stiffened—trouble indeed! Forcing a laugh, he countered, “Yu’er, what nonsense! The Spirit Pearl isn’t in my possession!”

Guan Yu’s fox-like smile sharpened. “Imperial Father, I never said it was.”

Trapped by his own haste, Akalili paled. The crowd’s silent judgment confirmed their suspicions. Ming Hanfeng’s icy stare pierced him while Ye Wuhen chuckled at Guan Yu’s cunning. Mu Bai trembled with excitement—rare demon crystals and Spirit Pearl rumors in one night!

To Akalili, the priceless demon crystals burned like hot coals. As others coveted them, he saw only peril. Regarding the Spirit Pearl, any denial would sound like confession. Swallowing his fury, he gritted, “We... thank Yu’er’s kindness.”

Ye Wuhen relaxed—she needed no protection. Nearby, Murong Siqi followed his gaze to Guan Yu, eyes filling with venom. Guan Yu noted but dismissed it—tonight’s enemies were legion.

Murong Qian broke the tension with poisoned sweetness. “So you’re the young prince! I’m your aunt~” Guan Yu met her false smile with frost. “I have only one mother.”

The rebuff left Murong Qian seething. Ming Hanfeng’s heart ached—what horrors had reshaped his once-gentle sister? Yet whatever her changes, she remained his to protect. Ye Wuhen watched their bond uneasily, sensing a rival.

“Griffin speaks truth. We depart.” Ming Hanfeng’s declaration brooked no argument. As they turned to leave, Murong Siqi’s shriek halted them: “Stop!”

Murong Qian desperately pulled her niece back, pleading to Akalili: “The child misspeaks!” Murong Yuhan joined the act: “Begging Your Majesty’s forgiveness!”

Undeterred, Murong Siqi pointed accusingly. “She stole sister’s Frostflute!” Guan Yu’s eyes flashed murder. “Auction houses favor the highest bidder.” The crowd sneered at Murong pettiness.

Murong Qian pressed on: “The Frostflute’s useless to you—name your price!” Murong Yuhan simpered agreement, posture belying her arrogance.

“Useless?” Guan Yu arched a brow. “It makes fine dog-beating material.” Laughter rippled through observers. Murong Yuhan’s smile cracked—no one had ever mocked her water-element prowess!

Guan Yu turned to leave, only to be stopped again. Murong Qian entreated Akalili: “Bestow the Frostflute to Yuhan!”

Night Wuchen chuckled. “Wrong petitioner, Consort Li. The owner stands yonder.” Murong Yuhan glared, then beseeched Akalili in vain.

Tian Huanyun fretted, but Ming Hanfeng squeezed her hand. “I’ll protect her.” Guan Yu caught her mother’s worry. “Fear nothing.” Her gaze hardened at the Murongs.

Courtiers divided—some urged surrendering the flute, others defended Guan Yu. A minister sneered: “With the prince’s talent, she needs no flute!” Ming Hanfeng identified the traitor: “That’s Master Shangguan.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed—time to prune weeds. Night Wuchen tensed—someone would pay dearly.

“Enough!” Guan Yu’s roar silenced the hall.

Murong Siqi strutted forward, hand outstretched. “Finally sensible? Hand it over!”

“Seeking death?” Guan Yu’s murderous aura froze the girl. A kick sent Murong Siqi crashing, ribs snapping. As the girl wailed, Murong Qian spat venom: “You...!”

Guan Yu stood imperious. “Anger me, pay the price.”

Akalili thundered: “Apologize!”

Guan Yu met his glare with scorn. Approaching the Murong sisters, she mused coldly: “How shall you die?”

Murong Siqi cowered, while Mu Bai stared—this reminded him of the red-haired修罗...

“Who dares touch my daughter?!” Roared a purple-robed minister—Murong Yuan. Guan Yu sneered: “I injured her. What of it?”

Ming Hanfeng tensed—Murong Yuan was formidable. Night Wuchen’s eyes promised bloodshed. Akalili remained ominously silent as Murong Yuan demanded justice.

Guan Yu stood unflinching. Let the storm come—she’d weather it as she had the abyss.
