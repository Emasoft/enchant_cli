“Especially in large cities like this, inspections and control are even stricter. To avoid exposing identities, only internal members of the Demonic Soul Sect know of this place—usually the proprietors and managers. The hired servers below might be outsiders, hence unaware of the affairs here.”

“Have your proprietor come down personally to see me. What I say must reach his ears directly. Go quickly,” Wang Xiaorong stated coolly.

The man behind the counter approached after hearing this. “Return to your duties,” he said to the server. After the server left, the middle-aged man examined Wang Xiaorong. “I am the deputy manager here. You may speak with me.”

Wang Xiaorong retrieved a square token from beneath her robes—a five-centimeter jade-like plaque engraved with a Ghost Butterfly pattern. Its uniqueness lay in the blood-red butterfly contrasting against the translucent green jade. Within the Demonic Soul Sect, only two such tokens existed: one with the Demon Sovereign, the other in the hands of Young Mistress Wang Xiaorong. This token represented the sect's highest authority, equivalent to the Demon Sovereign himself.

Upon seeing it, the man paled and immediately moved to kneel. Wang Xiaorong lifted her boot to block his descent. “Is the chief manager present? Take me to him. This is urgent.”

“Please follow me,” the man said deferentially, leading Wang Xiaorong and Guan Yu to a third-floor chamber. He knocked gently. “Chief Manager, an elder from the family has arrived.”

Chapter 4240: Speak Directly

Guan Yu deduced "the family" referred to the Demonic Soul Sect, while "elder" implied Wang Xiaorong's supreme status. A clatter echoed from within, followed by indistinct noises. When silence lingered without an answer, Wang Xiaorong frowned. “Does he not hear us?”

The deputy manager flushed. “He... likely needs a moment. This hour is usually for rest. Please forgive the delay.”

“We have urgent matters,” Wang Xiaorong pressed.

“Chief Manager! An elder is here!” the deputy called again. Finally, the door opened to reveal an oily-faced, rotund man with a hairless head and disheveled robes—resembling a plucked hog. His thick lips parted: “An elder? Which one?”

Ignoring him, the deputy gestured to Wang Xiaorong. “Please enter. State your needs freely.”

Inside, the deputy explained, “This bearer carries the Ghost Butterfly Token with urgent orders.” The chief manager stiffened—the Ghost Butterfly's appearance signaled the Demon Sovereign's direct command, an unprecedented event.

Guan Yu noted the room's stifling heat and disordered bedding. A corner of translucent silk fabric peeked from the bed—clearly feminine attire. Wang Xiaorong removed her beast-hide mask to reveal her face. Both managers dropped to their knees. “Young Mistress!”

“Rise,” she commanded. “Chief Manager, your rank within the sect?”

“Merely an Incense Master here, with the deputy as my second.”

Wang Xiaorong's gaze sharpened. “Daytime indulgences suggest excessive leisure. Does our establishment's income not fully reach the sect?” Her implication about embezzlement hung heavy.

Chapter 4243: Wait For My Return

“Grandfather, I've always obeyed you and Master. I promise to remain dutiful,” Qiqi said sweetly, addressing Wang Xiaorong. “Martial Aunt, please guide me if I err.”

Wang Xiaorong brightened at the title “Martial Aunt.” “We'll care for you well. You're clearly an obedient girl.”

As Qiqi continued addressing her respectfully, Wang Xiaorong's reservations dissolved. “I've brought no gifts—how thoughtless! Let me take you shopping for new clothes.”

“Thank you, but Grandfather made these.” Qiqi displayed patched garments of coarse fabric and handmade shoes. Wang Xiaorong's heart softened at the girl's poverty. “We'll feast first, then shop lavishly—your master pays!”

At their farewell, Qiqi tried giving her golden leaf to her grandfather. Guan Yu intervened: “Keep your trinket.” He pressed fifty silver taels into the old man's hands. “Settle comfortably—here or elsewhere?”

“Perhaps Shang Town...” the grandfather mused.

Qiqi urged, “Stay in Eight Families City! When I return...”

Guan Yu suggested securing housing near the sect's tavern through their connections. After dinner, disguised as merchants, they escorted Prince Zou to the safehouse. With only trusted retainers remaining after betrayals and deaths, Prince Zou now relied entirely on Zou Wuhui.

Chapter 4244: Inner Beauty

Presenting Qiqi as his disciple to Prince Zou, Guan Yu noted the prince's elevated regard for him. Post-dinner, they applied beast-hide disguises and stealthily escorted the prince to the sect's tavern. Wang Xiaorong sternly warned against leaks—the secret known only to four.

Reflecting on Prince Zou's decimated retinue—lost captains and poisoned traitors—Guan Yu recognized Zou Wuhui as the prince's last pillar. Solitude was safest now. The tavern's shadowed rooms swallowed the royal fugitive, leaving Guan Yu to ponder the fragile threads of loyalty binding their fractured company.
