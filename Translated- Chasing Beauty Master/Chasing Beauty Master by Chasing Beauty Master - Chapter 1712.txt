Guan Yu had been startled awake several times during the night, as had Siqi. Neither had rested well. Guan Yu felt utterly defeated—Ling Su’s ploy had succeeded brilliantly, leaving him powerless to counter.

By dawn the next day, Guan Yu rose early, determined to set out sooner. After all, Ling Su had suffered the worst restlessness the previous night. Let him exhaust himself today and resort to spiritual energy to replenish his strength. Once preparations were complete, the group resumed their journey, finally entering the true expanse of the desert.

Guan Yu mused that he should track down those sect brothers from the steamed bun shop and distribute silver among them. The coins weighed him down uselessly—better to use them to win hearts. He needed to rally all his sect brothers except Ling Su to his side. Only then would the days ahead proceed smoothly, and only then would it be easier to confront Ling Su when the time came.

After traveling some distance into the desert, Guan Yu ordered a halt. The arid air parched their throats. While humans could drink water, the camels needed rest. Pushing them too hard would spell disaster.

**Chapter 4478: By Your Side**

Siqi sat on a dune. Ling Su wisely kept his distance, still wary of provoking Guan Yu without a solid plan.

Noticing her melancholy as he approached, Guan Yu asked, “What’s wrong? Are you still tired from last night?”

“No.” She gestured vaguely at the surroundings. “Long ago, this was a village—my homeland. Now, not a trace remains. Only sand.”

“Here?” Guan Yu’s brows lifted. “Your home was swallowed by the desert? Then this area must have frequent storms and sandstorms.”

“My memories are hazy. I was young when sandstorms destroyed everything. When I left, remnants of villages still existed. Now…nothing.”

“Why settle here? Why not choose safer lands farther from the desert?” Guan Yu wondered aloud. It baffled him why people clung to harsh environments when better options existed.

Siqi sighed. “Some choices aren’t ours to make. My mother once said Father brought her here, but I don’t know why. I was too young to remember.”

“Enough of the past. Look forward. With me here, you’ll never fear anything again.”

Comforted, Siqi leaned against his shoulder. Their relationship was now public, requiring no pretense.

But peaceful moments never lasted. A senior brother Guan Yu had sent scouting earlier rushed over.

“Guan Yu! There’s a teahouse half an hour ahead. Let’s rest there!”

“A teahouse in the desert? Unbelievable.” Guan Yu stood, handing the man two silver ingots. “For your trouble. Consider it a token of gratitude.”

The senior brother’s eyes gleamed. “Many thanks! Just ask if you need anything else!”

“Keep this between us,” Guan Yu warned with a smile.

“Of course!”

As the group pressed onward, Guan Yu pondered the teahouse’s purpose. Who would operate in such desolation? Perhaps it served those seeking the Eight-Sided Drum Technique in Miao City. Yet once this frenzy passed, the business would wither.

Upon arrival, the ramshackle structure surprised them—crude wooden planks barely withstanding the winds. Inside, Guan Yu spotted a ghost butterfly emblem etched into a beam: the mark of the Demon Soul Sect.

Realizing this was their territory, he swiftly exited and instructed everyone to conceal their identities as disciples of the Cloud Azure Sect.

The teahouse offered only tea and water refills. While replenishing supplies, Guan Yu considered interrogating a staff member but hesitated. He still possessed a Ghost Butterfly Token, which could compel cooperation, yet revealing it now risked exposure.

**Chapter 4479: Suspicion**

Approaching Wang Jun, Guan Yu whispered, “Use your Demon Soul Sect status to inquire about Miao City’s location. It’d save us days of wandering.”

Wang Jun sighed but complied. A deputy hall master stopped him at the inner door.

“I’m here under the Young Master’s orders,” Wang Jun claimed. To prove his poisoned blood—a hallmark of the sect—he pricked his finger, letting dark blood swirl in a bowl.

Convinced, the deputy ushered him inside. “Our main force headed west two days ago. The Left Envoy leads another group arriving soon.”

Wang Jun relayed this to Guan Yu, who frowned. “He’s hiding something. If he doubted your story, our cover may be blown.”

**Chapter 4480: Complications**

“We can’t wait for the next group,” Guan Yu decided. “If we push westward, we might catch up. But navigating blindly…”

A disciple named Aze voiced concerns: “How long can we wander this desert?”

“Our supplies last ten days,” Guan Yu replied. “We must find Miao City by then—or perish with the camels.”

The ghost butterfly emblem watched silently as they vanished into the shimmering dunes, their fates entwined with secrets buried deeper than sand.
