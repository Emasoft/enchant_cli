“Therefore, concealing our identities remains crucial. Though the senior disciples still harbored some disdain for the Jia Yi Sect disciples' attire, everyone became more at ease after Guan Yu relayed the necessity of disguise.

After two days of rest, the lingering horror from the recent calamity had gradually faded from their minds. Guan Yu had also bolstered their morale, reminding them that surviving such a tribulation meant greater fortune lay ahead. Having endured this trial, nothing could daunt them now.

That evening, Xiaomei invited Guan Yu to her tent for a meal to discuss their upcoming journey. The road ahead would be arduous, potentially requiring several days to pinpoint Miao City's exact location.

Though Xiaomei, as a demon cultivator, possessed a unique ability to sense Miao City's presence, even she couldn't immediately locate it in this vast desert. A miscalculation in direction might lead them astray for days.

Yet Xiaomei remained unworried, confident in her abilities and the protection of Guan Yu's group. Despite her and her younger sister’s centuries of cultivation, they were equivalent to newly matured youths in human terms. Venturing alone into the desert would invite trouble.

With Guan Yu’s cultivators accompanying them, any challenges could be swiftly resolved. Xiaomei wouldn’t foolishly lead adversaries to Miao City—this was a relationship of mutual exploitation.

‘I trust everyone has rested sufficiently these past days,’ Xiaomei said between bites. ‘We depart tomorrow. The fifteenth of the seventh month approaches—we must secure Miao City’s location early to gain advantage.’ Her tone suggested meticulous preparation.

**Chapter 4567: Losses Can Be a Blessing**

Now, Siqi found Xiaomei less grating, perhaps due to prolonged exposure. Previously, the mere sight of the serpent demoness had unsettled her. Siqi’s deep-rooted fear of snakes had bred both aversion and terror.

Yet after days together, Siqi realized Xiaomei wasn’t so fearsome. Though the demoness occasionally gazed at Guan Yu with ambiguous intent, Siqi remained unperturbed. She knew Guan Yu’s tastes weren’t so mundane, and a serpent would hardly interest him.

Before Guan Yu could respond to Xiaomei’s proposal, Siqi interjected, ‘I’ve rested well these days, thanks to the Jia Yi Sect’s hospitality.’

‘Hmph, we’re friends—no need for formalities,’ Xiaomei replied with a smile that belied her thoughts. Internally, she seethed over Guan Yu’s delayed payment of eight hundred silver taels and his plundering of her sect’s finest tents and provisions—all acquired through arduous raids on other tribes.

Though stingy by nature, Xiaomei forced herself to maintain gracious hospitality, clinging to the promised silver. Once paid, she could replenish supplies by sending disciples to pillage other oases.

Guan Yu produced the silver notes. ‘Our partnership has weathered storms. Let this conclude our transaction.’ He handed them over, aware of Xiaomei’s mounting impatience. Losses here were inevitable.

Xiaomei snatched the notes, verified their authenticity, and beamed. ‘Cooperating with you was wise, Guan Yu. I treasure wealthy friends.’ She swiftly pocketed the payment.

‘The pleasure is mutual,’ Guan Yu replied. ‘What plans have you for the journey ahead?’

‘No concrete plans,’ Xiaomei admitted. ‘I’ll guide you via my methods. The duration and obstacles remain uncertain. Will your sister accompany us, or shall you bring disciples?’

‘No disciples.’ Xiaomei waved dismissively. ‘They excel at raiding but would be useless at Miao City. My sister and I shall go—it’ll be her cultivation trial.’

Her true motive lay in utilizing Guan Yu’s group as shields against dangers. A dozen cultivators outweighed a hundred ordinary sect members in combat. Disciples would only slow them in the treacherous desert.

**Chapter 4568: Special Circumstances**

Post-Miao City, their alliance would shatter. Upon locating the legendary Eight-Drum Technique, they’d become rivals. Xiaomei contemplated weakening Guan Yu’s forces beforehand to ensure her advantage.

Though reluctant to antagonize Yunqing Sect—the foremost orthodox faction—the allure of the supreme technique eclipsed caution. Rumors suggested Miao City’s appearance correlated with this year’s unusual convergence of seekers.

The Eight-Drum Technique, legacy of the ancient Demon Ancestor Menghua, promised unrivaled dominance. Xiaomei envisioned transcending her desert confinement to rule the martial world.

She theorized Miao City wasn’t an ephemeral demon realm portal but a permanently desert-hidden settlement veiled by powerful wards. The fifteenth’s lunar conditions might temporarily dispel these protections.

Guan Yu, meanwhile, focused on Xiaomei’s utility as a guide. Traversing the desert blindly risked exhausting spiritual energy amidst sudden storms. With her navigation, they’d conserve strength for true challenges.

‘How familiar are you with Miao City?’ Guan Yu probed. ‘Legends paint it as mystical—a demon realm city. As desert-born demon cultivators, what connects you to it?’

**Chapter 4569: Beyond Comparison**

‘I know only this: Miao City will emerge this year, housing the Eight-Drum Technique,’ Xiaomei stated bluntly.

Guan Yu nodded. ‘All factions seek it. Come the fifteenth, Miao City will teem with contenders.’

‘But if it doesn’t appear?’ Xiaomei countered. ‘Many will have died for nothing.’

‘A risk we accept,’ Guan Yu replied. ‘Why are you certain it’ll emerge?’

‘Menghua’s ancient scheme thrives,’ Guan Yu mused. ‘His legacy sows endless conflict. Now, his design reaches fruition.’"
