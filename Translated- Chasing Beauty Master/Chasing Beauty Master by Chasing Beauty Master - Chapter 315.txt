“As the person in charge of this assassination operation against Guan Yu, yet having to defer to Bo Hu at every turn has been unbearable for the proud and headstrong Zhan Shouwang. Now, even his desire to taste Guan Yu’s woman has been denied. Enraged, Zhan Shouwang lashed out.

‘But you’re not my boss. Kill him!’ Bo Hu said calmly, his tone indifferent.

Zhan Shouwang’s face turned livid, but he had no rebuttal.

Bo Hu was right. Hiring a high-caliber professional killer like him wasn’t something Zhan could achieve alone. But greed consumed Zhan. He not only wanted to see Guan Yu die horribly but also desired to defile the women Guan Yu had touched, relishing the vengeful thrill. At the very least, he wanted Guan Yu’s spirit to find no peace!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Gunfire shattered the night’s silence—not from the sniper’s rifle, but from the darkness. The shots were chaotic yet rhythmic.

Sniper One was the first to fall, a bullet through his temple, collapsing lifelessly.

‘Ambush! Scatter!’ Bo Hu roared, rolling swiftly to the ground while firing toward the source. His two remaining comrades followed suit, unleashing a barrage of gunfire.

Terrified, Zhan Shouwang scrambled away, ducking behind a tree, gasping for breath.

Gao Wei sat rigidly on the ground, her expression numb.

Suddenly, she felt herself being lifted. Looking up, her dilated pupils contracted as she recognized the face. ‘Guan Yu! You’re alive?’

‘Who said I was dead? Don’t speak. We need to escape.’ Guan Yu snapped, activating his gravity system to lighten their weight. Holding Gao Wei, he vanished into the darkness.

Gao Wei clung to his neck, studying his profile in the dark. A warm, sticky fluid soaked her thigh—blood. Guan Yu was injured!

Tears blurred her vision. Despite his wounds, he’d risked everything to save her. Overwhelmed, she tightened her grip.

Guan宇 gritted his teeth. After being shot, he’d returned to their tent to scavenge energy supplements, exhausting a stun baton to heal his wounds. But the exertion reopened them, blood seeping out, leaving him drained.

He hadn’t anticipated Zhan’s thorough planning. Injured and cornered, escape was their only option.

Bo Hu’s rage flared as he realized Guan Yu had outwitted him again. ‘After them!’

Chapter 796: Perilous Encounter

Twice humiliated, even a saint would rage. Bo Hu’s team followed the blood trail to a cliff’s edge.

‘They jumped,’ the sniper concluded after finding broken branches.

Bo Hu smirked. ‘Without wings, they’re dead.’

Satisfied, he ordered the team to withdraw, vowing to confirm at dawn.

Chapter 797: Survivors

After a futile night’s search, Bo Hu forced Zhan to descend the cliff. Reluctantly, Zhan complied, only to be betrayed and executed.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Gao Wei lay unconscious at the cliff’s base, battered but alive. The copper coin’s faint glow slowly mended Guan Yu’s injuries.

When Guan Yu awoke, relief washed over him. ‘I survived!’

Weak but determined, he checked Gao Wei. Both lived, their survival a testament to resilience—and the copper coin’s mysterious power.
