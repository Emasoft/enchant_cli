“Alright, we’ll do as you say.”

The two arrived at a clothing store. From its exterior, the shop seemed quite decent. Given the town’s modest size, having such a sizable clothing store was already impressive.

Upon entering, a middle-aged woman—likely the shop owner or a hired attendant—greeted them. “How may I assist you? My, what a lovely young lady and such a handsome gentleman! If I may guess, you two must be husband and wife?”

Her flattery, essential for business, immediately pleased Wang Xiaorong. Smiling, she replied, “You’ve got a good eye. I’d like to buy a veil. Do you have any fine ones?”

“Preferably ultra-thin and in light colors,” Guan Yu added.

“Of course, of course! Please come inside. Though it’s off-season for veils, our stock is plentiful. Take your time browsing,” the woman effused before calling out, “Auntie Chen, mind the shop! I’ll escort these esteemed guests to select their items.”

She led them to a small room at the innermost corner of the second floor. “These are the finest veils in the entire town,” she declared proudly.

Guan Yu surveyed the selection—dozens of styles, mostly embroidered with floral patterns on thick fabric. He sought something different: a sheer, semi-transparent chiffon veil to lightly obscure Wang Xiaorong’s face. Her fair complexion would suit pastel hues, so he selected three veils in powder-white, pale pink, and soft yellow.

Though Wang Xiaorong typically favored deeper shades like black or red, the delicate veils transformed her appearance. Adorned in the gossamer fabric, she took on an ethereal, almost celestial aura, resembling a pure and otherworldly fairy.

Pleased with Guan Yu’s choices, they returned to the inn—only to discover Yan Zhao still feasting at the table. Guan Yu stared in disbelief. The gluttonous man, belly distended, continued gnawing a chicken claw while massaging his stomach with greasy fingers.

“Senior Brother Yan Zhao, what are you doing?” Guan Yu inquired, stifling laughter at the sight of rice grains clinging to the man’s oily face.

Yan Zhao jumped, nearly choking. “Mustn’t... waste...” he burped, meat flecks spraying from his teeth. “My silver paid for this! Miss Meimei hates waste, right?” His speech slurred under the weight of his gluttony.

Wang Xiaorong waved a hand before her nose. “By all means, finish every morsel. We’ll be impressed.”

“Exactly!” Yan Zhao wheezed. “Like camels storing nourishment! Economical!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Enjoy your night in the latrine.” He departed, leaving the fool to his digestive fate.

As dusk settled, the town buzzed with evening activity. Though Wang Xiaorong wished to explore, fatigue from travel prevailed. Guan Yu meditated in their room while she wandered the inn’s courtyard-style corridors.

Her stroll revealed peculiar guests: two men in monk-like black robes—one freakishly tall with mismatched features, the other ordinary. Later, a scarred youth staggering under a massive sack paused to flirt: “Even veiled, your grace betrays beauty. Care to acquaint?”

She ignored him, noting his room neighbored theirs. Returning, she found Guan Yu waiting. “Should we rest early? Tomorrow’s journey awaits.”

They retired, Wang Xiaorong savoring their shared bed despite the noisy wooden stairs. Near midnight, a shrill voice shattered the peace: “Master Yue Gao! Our meeting was set for tomorrow, but I must consult you now!”

A richly dressed matron accosted Guan Yu in the hallway. “Are you Master Yue Gao? No? Then where is he?” Her imperious tone shifted to disdain when denied.

“Madam,” Guan Yu coolly advised, “respect others’ rest. Consult the innkeeper.”

She scoffed, flouncing off. Wang Xiaorong stirred sleepily. “Trouble?”

“Nothing worth waking for,” he murmured, watching the entitled woman retreat. Her type—privileged, overbearing—were best avoided. The night’s final hours passed in fitful quiet, the travelers’ minds already drifting toward tomorrow’s harsh desert trials.
