“Big Young Master, do you think Guan Yu is someone who incites hatred wherever he goes? Even the thought of contraband gets pinned on him,” Xu Yuan teased.

“If you don’t want others to know, you shouldn’t have done it. His background was never clean to begin with. It’s no surprise he’s suspected of carrying illegal items,” Jiang Ziqi said with a faint smile.

Xu Yuan glanced at him, joking, “Who do you think has it out for him? Could it be you, Big Young Master?”

“Regardless of who dislikes him, at least he and I share the same goal. The result has been achieved. Now we just need to sit back and enjoy the show,” Jiang Ziqi said, neither confirming nor denying. But the other two understood—who else could have orchestrated this farce besides Jiang Ziqi himself?

“Shall we go to the café and watch this drama unfold?” Xu Yuan laughed.

Jiang Ziqi nodded and walked into the café with Yang Yang and Xu Yuan, chatting and laughing.

In the airport interrogation room, Guan Yu remained calm amidst the encircling security personnel. “You know there’s no contraband here. So how do you plan to ‘find’ it? Distract me and slip it into my clothes?”

The lead security guard sneered, “We’re just doing our jobs. Whether it’s there or not, we’ll find out after the search. Cooperate, or else.”

“Not bad,” Guan Yu remarked cryptically, leaving the others bewildered.

The guard avoided directly answering, fearing Guan Yu might have recording devices. “Take off your clothes!”

“Any cameras here? Planning an ‘airport scandal’?” Guan Yu quipped.

The guard stiffened. “We’re legitimate airport staff! Take it off!”

“If I strip and you find nothing, you’ll be violating my privacy. Also, I suspect you’re into men. If you try anything while I’m undressing, that’s attempted assault. Still want me to strip?”

“Just take it off!” the guard roared.

Guan Yu slowly unzipped his jacket. “Sure you’re not into men?”

The guard’s face darkened. “Screw your mother!”

*Bang!*

The guard flew across the room, slamming into the wall. Unnoticed, Guan Yu discreetly filmed a subordinate planting drugs in his jacket.

Later, when the “evidence” was “found,” Guan Yu revealed the footage. “This proves I was framed.”

The lead guard paled. “Arrest him!”

“You’re making a mistake!” Guan Yu warned.

“Take him away!”

As officers moved to cuff him, a voice rang out: “Stop!”

Wen Qing stormed in. “Uncuff him!”

“Interfering with police business?” the commander snarled.

“Try it,” Wen Qing challenged.

**Chapter 726: Framed**

The plot unraveled—Guan Yu’s video exposed the setup. The real culprit was arrested instead.

**Chapter 727: Counter-Framed**

The trap backfired. Guan Yu’s evidence cleared him, implicating the conspirators.

**Chapter 728: First Clash**

Wen Qing’s arrival shifted the tide. “Release him!”

The commander hesitated, sensing the tide turning.

Guan Yu smiled. “Told you I’d be out soon.”
