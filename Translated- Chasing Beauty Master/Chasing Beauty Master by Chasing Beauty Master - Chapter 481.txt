In this era, high-level cultivators could not casually move about. Thus, those attending the tribulation ceremony were all prominent representatives currently active from various sects. Naturally, those affiliated with Guan Yu or the White Cloud Temple were present—Zuo Qingyi, Zhang Ziran, and Fa Neng had all arrived. The Kunlun Sect sent a youth named Ye Xiuyuan. Though nothing seemed amiss during introductions, Guan Yu clearly sensed this seemingly young man was actually a Golden Core Peak powerhouse. Notably, he bore the surname Ye.

"Haha! Little Snivel, it's actually you who came?" Ye Qingling suddenly appeared with a mischievous grin. "Did Uncle finally consent to let you descend the mountain?"

"Ahem..." Ye Xiuyuan's eyes flickered with embarrassment, though he maintained composure. "Now that you're married, can't you behave more dignified? Since Father permitted my departure, it naturally indicates I've proven worthy."

"Though I dislike uttering such clichés," Ye Xiuyuan's gaze softened as he turned to Guan Yu, "brother-in-law, you seem to be doing well. I hope this continues. Should the day come when this girl returns to Kunlun in tears, I shall come for you."

"While I too dislike formalities," Guan Yu rubbed his temples, "I'm currently overwhelmed. Qingling, since he's your cousin, please assist with hosting duties. My apologies." Unaccustomed to handling such intricate social affairs during his first major responsibility, Guan Yu's mood remained strained.

Guan Yu's departure didn't quell the murmurs about him. The massive gathering included not only orthodox sect disciples but also old acquaintances of Wild Crane Daoist. This ceremonial occasion strictly forbade unauthorized entry within ten kilometers of Sunrise Platform—transgressors wouldn't merely endanger Wild Crane, but would themselves disintegrate beneath heavenly tribulation.

The current world brimmed with tension. Though spiritual energy gradually recovered, the primal forces of heaven and earth still vehemently rejected high-level cultivators—those defying natural order to seek transcendence. The Heavenly Dao showed no mercy to such rebels, seizing every opportunity to obliterate them.

"Is this the final spectacle of the world's number one Wild Crane? Not an unimpressive display." A clear, arrogant voice rang out without regard for the audience.

Guan Yu's eyebrow twitched. Only vetted personnel should have entered, yet this intruder's voice—though quiet—was undoubtedly heard by his master through White Cloud Temple's surveillance formations.

"Esteemed guest," Guan Yu's gaze sharpened, "if you've come sincerely to witness my master's tribulation, White Cloud Temple welcomes you. For troublemakers—the mountain gate lies yonder. Kindly see yourself out." The middle-aged speaker suddenly staggered back as if struck, collapsing unconscious after three steps.

"Ho! So this is White Cloud Temple's hospitality?" Another aged voice mocked. "Truly eye-opening. So-called righteous sects prove mediocre."

"Shi Lei," Guan Yu frowned, "identify the disciples responsible for vetting. Cross-reference that man's features at the mountain gate. Determine who permitted their entry." Though the latest heckler had been swiftly ejected by Whale Three, Guan Yu grew increasingly vexed. These constant disruptions presaged greater dangers—particularly if provocateurs attempted suicide charges into the tribulation lightning alongside Wild Crane.

"Honored guests," Guan Yu clasped hands, "for my master's crucial tribulation, I must request all retreat another ten kilometers. The view remains unobstructed. We apologize for this imposition." His frown deepened as he dispatched Ye Qingling to coordinate with Kunlun and three other major sects, Shi Lei to prepare formations, and Mo Ling to monitor the gates. Only Dongfang Huowu remained—Guan Yu now realized no White Cloud disciples attended him.

This abnormality struck Guan Yu—he'd fallen into a long-present trap he'd failed to detect.

"By what right? Ten kilometers is standard for tribulation viewing!"

"Exactly! White Cloud grows overbearing—first ten li, then another ten? Young man, are you truly authorized? Fetch someone credible to explain!"

Chaos erupted before Guan Yu finished speaking. Though aware most attendees meant no harm, the situation exasperated him.

"ROAR!"

An enormous yellow dragon soared skyward. Complainers vanished—teleported ten kilometers away via Dragon Subduing Palm enhanced by gravity domain. White light flashed, trapping them in non-restrictive containment arrays. All understood Guan Yu's preventive measures.

"Cough... Brother-in-law," Ye Xiuyuan remarked with disappointment, "this solves nothing. By acting rashly, you forfeit eligibility for White Cloud's leadership." He saw subtler, more harmonious solutions—many ejected weren't truly troublemakers.

"I never desired leadership," Guan Yu's eyes turned glacial. "I remain solely for my master. Should anything befall him, certain individuals will pay with their lives—this is no jest."

He knew gentler methods existed, but cared only for Wild Crane's safety. White Cloud's leadership meant nothing compared to his bond with his master. Choosing the simplest, most direct—if harsh—solution reflected his priorities.

BOOM!

Ominous clouds gathered, oppressive might enveloping White Cloud Temple. Every soul trembled before this heavenly wrath.

"Heavenly might is as merciless as a prison..." Fa Neng murmured solemnly. For Buddhists, reverence towards cosmic laws ran deeper than ordinary cultivators'.

None dared jest now. All spectators—well-wishers and mockers alike—watched breathlessly as the former world's strongest faced this terrifying trial.

Violet tribulation clouds darkened to pitch. Bucket-thick heavenly lightning struck nine times simultaneously—though Guan Yu's enhanced perception detected subtle sequencing.

Astonishment rippled through the crowd as Wild Crane made no defensive moves. Nine lightning bolts struck his physical body directly. Violet sparks danced across his form, yet he remained serene as breeze-ruffled clouds. Guan Yu perceived profound truths within those drifting mists.

"Cloud Form Wind Body of Mahayana realm!" Qin Wuliang's voice quivered. "Your master's genius reshaped a Golden Core body tempering technique! Using heavenly lightning for physical refinement—terrifying!"

"Master!" Qin Wuliang suddenly warned. A blue-clad giant materialized beside Guan Yu as a shadowy figure breached the ten-kilometer perimeter at Nascent Soul-level speed.

"Insanity!" Guan Yu's face darkened. "Whale Three—capture alive! I'll learn who dares this!" Gravity domain concentrated into a pinpoint barrier.

"Die!" The black-clad intruder slashed with twin daggers forming a demonic cross. Purple-black energy reeked of devilish qi.

"A demonic cultivator! Interesting..." Whale Three snorted. Grabbing air, he effortlessly disarmed the Nascent Soul expert, suspending him midair.

"Damned..." The struggler's curse died as Whale Three slammed him down, reducing him to broken pulp.

This display stunned spectators—both gleeful onlookers and allies from four major sects. Who was this blue-clad titan? White Cloud wasn't known to harbor another Tribulation Passage expert!

Guan Yu's fury neared eruption. He'd never realized how many enemies his master had accrued. That a Nascent Soul+ demonic cultivator infiltrated proved collaborators' desperation.

"Honored guests," Guan Yu forced a smile, eyes flashing murder, "this demonic intrusion shames our sect. As all righteous factions oppose demonkind, I request your witness. After master's tribulation, we'll thoroughly investigate—apologies beforehand for necessary actions." Though holding moral authority, Guan Yu needed these orthodox leaders' support—a harsh reality of White Cloud's decline he'd hitherto ignored.

Chapter 1219: Unleashing Carnage

Wild Crane's tribulation proceeded smoothly—or rather, with transcendent ease. Only during the final heavenly strike did he employ White Cloud's guardian spirit artifact—a violet seal instantly suppressing both lightning and dissipating tribulation clouds.

After eighty-one tribulations spanning day and night, Wild Crane emerged revitalized. Laughing heartily, he absorbed the post-tribulation vitality—life-giving qi useless to ordinary cultivators but vital for healing tribulation wounds.

Descending Sunrise Platform, Wild Crane's expression sobered. Guan Yu remained silent about the disruptions—master and disciple shared unspoken understanding.

Three days later, Wild Crane summoned all White Cloud disciples. Only then did Guan Yu witness the sect's true state.

Decline—utter decline. The world's fourth-ranked orthodox sect boasted no Tribulation Passage cultivators beyond Wild Crane. Below: one Unity Stage, three Divine Separation, three Soul Projection, fifteen Nascent Souls, under fifty Golden Cores.

Compared to Kunlun's splendor, this constituted devastating withering—a scene bordering on apocalyptic demise.

"My unworthy leadership brought White Cloud to ruin." Wild Crane's newly ascended Mahayana aura pressed like collapsing heavens. "Were I to ascend, how could I face ancestors? Yet even at my worst—does solving our waning spiritual veins require colluding with demonic sects?"

"Master overstates!" Chun Yuan—one of three Divine Separation elders and Wild Crane's junior brother—protested. "Without your efforts, White Cloud wouldn't exist! Our spiritual vein damage stems from traitors—all here know this!"

"Elder Chun Yang?" Wild Crane turned to the sole Unity Stage law-enforcement elder.

The grey-haired elder sighed, glancing at Guan Yu before calling forth two Nascent Soul guards. "Disciples Jing Xin and Jing Yi—step forward."

"We bear fault, Master!" The trembling pair knelt. "But the mountain arrays detected no demonic aura! We never neglected duty!"

"Enough." Guan Yu coldly interrupted. "Many here disapprove of my succession. Let this be known—I never desired White Cloud's leadership. But henceforth, any using this to attack my master will face my unrelenting wrath." His icy gaze swept the hall. The dead demonic cultivator's fate exemplified consequences.

Wild Crane sighed. "All may withdraw. Elders Chun Yuan, Chun Yang, and Jing Si remain."

Exhaustion etched his features—not physical, but decades of spiritual burden. Time to relinquish responsibilities.

That day, White Cloud held succession rites. Second-generation disciple Jing Si became new sect master. Wild Crane entered seclusion to repair damaged spiritual veins.
