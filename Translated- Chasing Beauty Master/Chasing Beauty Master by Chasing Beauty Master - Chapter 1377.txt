“Senior Brother Sect Leader,” Elder Xiang said with a bitter expression, “Guanyu shows no respect for his elders, speaks recklessly, and has gravely insulted me. Do these not count as offenses?”

Xuanming knew Guanyu had indeed erred. He also understood Elder Xiang had been targeting Guanyu since entering, their personal grudge fueling this confrontation. Elder Xiang, ever petty, still nursed resentment over his disciple’s death in the woods months prior.

“Guanyu is a disciple of Tiger Summit Peak under your leadership. If you cannot give me a proper resolution today, I will not let him off lightly,” Elder Xiang declared.

This put Xuanming in a difficult position. Guanyu spoke up, “Master, since Elder Xiang so vehemently opposes me, there’s no need for you to endure this strife. As sect leader, you needn’t feud with others over a mere disciple like myself.”

Kneeling, Guanyu continued, “Master, I thank you for your teachings and care these past months. But since I’m unwelcome here, I’ve decided to leave Cloud Azure Sect. I return the magical artifacts you and Elder Lu gifted me. Please expel me from the sect!”

Elder Xiang smirked inwardly, pleased the insolent whelp was crumbling. “Good, you know your place. But leaving Cloud Azure Sect isn’t so simple. Having learned our techniques, your cultivation must be crippled before departure!”

“Guanyu, stop this nonsense!” Siqi interjected urgently. “No one is expelling you!”

Xiao Zhi and A’ze stepped forward, their bond with Guanyu forged through life-and-death trials. Kneeling before Xuanming, Xiao Zhi pleaded, “Sect Master, Guanyu cannot leave! He’s Cloud Azure’s rising star, our pillar! During recent missions, without his protection we’d have perished. His contributions are undeniable!”

Ignoring others, Guanyu addressed Xuanming, “Master, I’ve only learned the Sword Flight Technique. Must even this be stripped? I vow never to use it again. Please let me retain this basic skill.”

Xuanming felt besieged by all sides. He’d never intended to expel Guanyu – this rare genius of Dual Cultivation, a prodigy unseen in millennia. Why were they pleading as if punishment was imminent?

Elder Mu, clearly aligning with Elder Xiang, added fuel: “Senior Brother Sect Leader, exempting Guanyu from sect rules breeds discontent. If all disciples defy regulations, what purpose does Bamboo Forest Peak serve?”

Guanyu seethed at Elder Mu’s manipulation. The bastard used Bamboo Forest’s authority to pressure Xuanming.

Elder Lu rose: “Senior Brother, though Guanyu’s time here is brief, he’s worked diligently. Mere arguments with Junior Brother Xiang shouldn’t warrant severe punishment. A minor disciplinary action suffices.”

“What nonsense!” Elder Xiang rounded on Elder Lu, face flushing. “This disciple’s lawless insolence is no trivial matter! Are you implying my grievances are petty?”

“Enough!” Xuanming’s roar silenced the hall. “What is this? Internal warfare?”

The sect leader’s anger cowed all present. Even Elder Xiang slumped back, chastened.

“Let me clarify,” Xuanming declared. “Guanyu’s exemption stems from his being a once-in-a-millennium Dual Cultivator. Should any here match this feat, they too shall receive special privileges!”

The revelation hushed the assembly. Many had forgotten Guanyu’s unique status amidst the drama. Elder Xiang cursed inwardly – with Guanyu’s rapid growth as a Dual Cultivator, their feud would only worsen.

“Guanyu’s presence honors Cloud Azure Sect,” Xuanming continued. “His mastery of our arts brings glory. Petty squabbles must be set aside. My assignments aimed to temper his talents.”

Relieved, Guanyu stood taller. Xuanming’s public praise was unexpected face.

“As sect brethren,” Xuanming concluded, “harmony is paramount. Those dissatisfied with Guanyu’s treatment may voice objections – provided they demonstrate comparable merits.”

As others rose at Xuanming’s gesture, Guanyu shot Elder Xiang a挑衅 glare. The elder’s rage boiled over – none dared disrespect him so!

“Think the sect leader’s favor makes you untouchable?” Elder Xiang roared, suddenly summoning an iron ruler artifact. A spell blast rocketed toward Guanyu.

The abrupt attack shocked all. A century-old elder assaulting a junior? Outrageous!

Guanyu reacted instantly. Soul Sunder Sword leaped to his hand. Darting aside, he evaded the spell while counterattacking – a golden battle-qi wave followed by azure magic orb, Dual Cultivation’s signature tandem assault.

Xuanming, though capable of intervention, watched intently. This clash between veteran and prodigy proved too intriguing.

Elder Xiang hastily erected defensive barriers. Blocking the initial strikes, he prepared retaliation – only for Guanyu’s blade to descend like lightning. Forced to teleport via Advanced Displacement Technique, the elder barely dodged.

The battle escalated, Guanyu’s hybrid offense pressing the experienced elder. When a misstep left Elder Xiang wounded, Xuanming finally intervened.

Later, in private chambers, Xuanming addressed Guanyu: “For wounding an elder, seclusion is warranted. But rather than dank cells, guard Hidden Dragon Sword with Elder Jiu at Rear Peak. Continue your training there.”

Guanyu accepted gladly – Rear Peak offered better cultivation opportunities and escape from Elder Xiang’s venom.

Returning to the main hall, Xuanming announced the “punishment”. Yan Zhao, secretly manipulated by demonic forces, protested weakly before schemes brewed anew. The sect leader’s decision stood – Guanyu’s exile to Rear Peak was but the eye of an gathering storm.
