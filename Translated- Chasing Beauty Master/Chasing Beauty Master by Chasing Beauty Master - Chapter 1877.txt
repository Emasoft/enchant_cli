“Hahaha, alright, I’ll have a piece then.” The Emperor chuckled, bending forward to take the meat Jiang Xin (Heart) had picked up with his mouth, swallowing it in one bite.

Overjoyed to see Jiang Xin (Heart) lively and energetic again, the Emperor and the Eldest Princess were genuinely delighted. At this moment, the Eldest Princess specifically remarked, “Father, this time it was all thanks to the wisdom and bravery of the Eldest Prince that Xin’er was rescued in time. I just heard from Xin’er that Cao Di (Deliverer) actually attempted to violate her. This time, I implore you to show no mercy to the Cao family!”

“Hmph! Of course I won’t let them off lightly,” the Emperor said coldly. “However, there are still matters to investigate. The Qin family also seems implicated in this affair. If evidence is found, they shall be dealt with together!”

**Chapter 4933: A Reminder**

“But regarding this incident, the Eldest Prince merits reward for his service. I’ve tasked him with leading the investigation. Once it concludes, I shall bestow honors upon him accordingly.” The Emperor added, “You’re right—without his quick thinking, Xin’er might have faced irreversible calamity. A moment later would have been too late.”

Jiang Xin (Heart) nibbled her food while listening, puzzled by the Eldest Princess’s insistence that the Eldest Prince had saved her. Yet, being clever, she refrained from questioning it aloud.

The Eldest Princess then asked, “Xin’er, can you now explain how you were captured?”

“Yes.” Despite her hunger, Jiang Xin (Heart) maintained the refined manners instilled since childhood, eating slowly and swallowing before speaking. “Unaware of danger, I ventured out with only two maids and no guards. I visited the Rouge Opera House, as they’re undergoing renovations and Chu Fan (Mortal) was occupied. Father also asked me to relay a message to Young Master Wan Hong (Vast Expansion), requesting a meeting.

When I met Young Master Wan Hong (Vast Expansion), he warned me of recent dangers and urged me to return early. I obeyed, but on my way back, someone struck me from behind. I awoke bound in a stone chamber, unable to move.”

The Eldest Princess nearly bristled. This Wan Hong (Vast Expansion)—a mysterious outsider—seemed entangled in every affair, omnipresent yet inscrutable.

One detail piqued her curiosity. “Xin’er, you say he warned you beforehand?”

“Yes. He even offered to escort me home, but I declined to avoid inconveniencing him. Who knew disaster would strike?”

The Emperor and Eldest Princess exchanged glances. “Who *is* this Wan Hong (Vast Expansion)?”

“The Imperial Consort has investigated him but found little. Some say he uses a pseudonym,” the Eldest Princess replied. “He’s new to the capital yet involved in major dealings—lavish, bold, and already at odds with the Cao and Qin families. He gifted Xin’er the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl at the antique auction, sparking this turmoil.”

“If he foresaw the danger,” the Emperor mused, “could he have orchestrated it?”

The Eldest Princess hesitated. “Unlikely. Having surrendered the Dragon Pearl, he’d gain nothing. Moreover, he crippled Cao Di (Deliverer), earning the Cao family’s hatred. I believe he merely acted on rumors, his capabilities exceeding our assumptions. His presence has stirred the capital’s waters.”

The Emperor shrugged. “If he’s so enigmatic, arrest and interrogate him.”

“No!” Jiang Xin (Heart) protested. “Young Master Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) has aided me greatly. Were it not for him, I wouldn’t have survived! You mustn’t arrest him—you should thank him!”

“Oh? *He* rescued you?” The Emperor frowned.

“Father, she’s distraught,” the Eldest Princess interjected, keen to credit the Eldest Prince. “In truth, Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) assisted at Chu Fan (Mortal)’s behest. The opera singer shares ties with Xin’er, as you know.”

The Emperor nodded, though the Eldest Princess privately wondered why Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) would yield credit to the Eldest Prince.

“Arresting him is unwise,” she continued. “He’s reckless but hasn’t transgressed. When he injured Qu Hua (Song Splendor), the Qin family sent a hundred guards—two masters died, yet he emerged unscathed. Even the Imperial Consort admitted he couldn’t best him.”

She recalled Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) calling Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) a “once-in-a-millennium genius,” a master of both demonic and martial arts—though she doubted such claims.

**Chapter 4934: Unresolved**

Moreover, Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening)’s “investigation” of Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) masked a hunt for the Eastern Sea treasure. He already knew Guan Yu (Closed Universe)’s identity but kept silent.

“That formidable?” The Emperor marveled. He’d witnessed the Imperial Consort’s prowess firsthand—outpacing a leopard on a hunt. Yet this Wan Hong (Vast Expansion) surpassed even him? The thought unsettled him.

Meanwhile, Chu Fan (Mortal) rejoiced at Jiang Xin (Heart)’s rescue. Guan Yu (Closed Universe), visiting the Imperial Consort’s estate, met Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening).

“Thank you for your aid,” Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) began. Though the palace credited the Eldest Prince, he knew Guan Yu (Closed Universe) had orchestrated everything. Why surrender such glory?

“You’re too kind,” Guan Yu (Closed Universe) replied. “I acted for your sake and Chu Fan (Mortal)’s bond with Xin’er. Fortunately, I intervened just as Cao Di (Deliverer) prepared to assault her.”

Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) clenched his fists. “That bastard Cao Di (Deliverer) deserved worse than death!”

“The crisis has passed, but the Dragon Pearl’s shadow remains. Xin’er must stay guarded.”

“I understand. Now, I should visit her.”

Guan Yu (Closed Universe) admired his composure—prioritizing duty over paternal anxiety.

“Why cede credit to the Eldest Prince?” Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) finally asked.

“It was his merit. I merely assisted.”

Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) dropped it, respecting Guan Yu (Closed Universe)’s humility. The capital buzzed with Cao family’s downfall and speculation about the Qin family’s fate.

“Cao Di (Deliverer)’s father was captured at the Qin estate, blaming Qin,” Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) noted.

Guan Yu (Closed Universe) shrugged. “The Cao family stole Qin goods, incurring losses. This may be retaliation or desperate lies.”

He knew the court coveted both families’ demise but needed justification.

“Rumors say you use a false name,” Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) pressed.

“Do you doubt me?”

“No. But since you’ve admitted it, may I ask—how does a Yunqing Sect (Cloud Azure) disciple consort with the Demonic Soul Sect’s heir, Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus)?”

Guan Yu (Closed Universe) smiled. “Fate binds us, like Xin’er and Chu Fan (Mortal). We hide our bond, forbidden by sect rivalries.”

Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) nodded. “They say you even defied your sect elders.”

“I endure no disrespect. To yield invites perpetual scorn.”

**Chapter 4935: Invitation**

Their conversation turned until Jiang Yuankai (Original Opening) departed, leaving Guan Yu (Closed Universe) to ponder the unresolved storm. The capital’s game was far from over.
