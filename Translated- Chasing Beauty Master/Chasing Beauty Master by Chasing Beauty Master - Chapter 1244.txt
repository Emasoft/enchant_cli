“If there’s anything you don’t understand, just ask the seller again. At that point, the seller only needs to answer questions. There’s no need to endlessly praise or boast about how good their product is. Often, such a chatterbox seller will backfire spectacularly.”

After emerging from the shop, the dealer glanced at Guan Yu, unsure if he was genuinely here to buy a car—especially since he noticed the woman standing nearby. This woman often loitered around the market, and the dealer naturally knew her role, though he had no dealings with her. Moreover, Guan Yu had already visited once before and returned. Had he not found a suitable car elsewhere?

The dealer chuckled lightly. “Here to look at this car? You’ve come to the right place, brother. My surname is Huang. No pressure to buy—just looking is free.” Huang was sharp-eyed. Noticing Guan Yu’s intense focus on the van, he sensed a real buyer.

He quickly added, “To be honest, there aren’t many vans here. Sales are usually dominated by SUVs and family sedans. Vans rarely sell, and frankly, they’re gas-guzzlers. You might even have to pay extra taxes since this one’s a nine-seater.”

Guan Yu studied Huang, surprised by his candidness. “I checked out another van elsewhere, but the price was too steep, so I came back. But that dealer claimed your cars are cheap because they’re accident vehicles. That can’t be true, right?”

“Who said that?!” Huang’s eyes blazed as he glared at the woman nearby, jabbing a finger at her. “Only your damn family would spout such lies! ‘Accident vehicles’—those words are taboo here! Your cars are overpriced, so you slander mine as accident wrecks? You’re just stirring shit!”

Huang, now incensed, turned back to Guan Yu. “Who said that? Bring them here! Let’s see whose cars are really accidents!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “The dealer I just visited. He bragged his cars were pristine, claimed your Toyota van’s low price meant it’s an accident vehicle, warned me not to buy it, and said his cars come with a three-year warranty while yours—being accidents—don’t dare offer one.”

“That motherfucker! Spouting bullshit! Did I fuck his ancestors for him to slander me like this? My cars have never seen a repair shop! If he wants to talk accidents, today I’ll settle this!” Huang stormed toward the area Guan Yu indicated. Only two vans were nearby: his Toyota and a Volkswagen van at the other shop.

“Wang, you son of a bitch—get out here!” Huang kicked a white sedan’s front bumper, triggering its blaring alarm.

Wang emerged, baffled. Though he and Huang had coexisted peacefully for years, this sudden aggression was unprecedented. His freshly detailed car, meant to attract buyers, now bore a scuffed bumper and a glaring shoe print.

Wang’s temper flared. “Huang! Have you lost your mind? What’s my car done to you?”

Huang roared, “You told him my cars are accidents! Repaired junk! That I don’t honor warranties! Was that your shitty lie?”

Wang paled—he had indeed made those remarks, never expecting the buyer to repeat them. He glanced around for the woman, but she’d vanished, wisely fleeing before the storm.

Wang forced a smile. “Old Huang, it was just sales banter! You know how it is—”

“Banter? I’ve never badmouthed you to customers! Where’s your business ethics?” Huang’s fury burned unabated.

Wang backtracked, “I only said cheaper cars aren’t necessarily better… It wasn’t serious.”

“Not serious? I’ve got customers now, but this isn’t over!” Huang turned to leave, but Wang snapped, “Think you’re superior because sales are up? If your cars are so good, why fear criticism? Haven’t you trash-talked others too?”

“What I say about my cars is none of your damn business!” Huang lunged, punching Wang in the face. The scuffle escalated as Wang’s young employee joined in, turning it two against one.

Guan Yu watched coldly before motioning to his companion, Zhìyú Láng. “Let’s go.” He had no time for this drama. The market had other vans.

Ultimately, Guan Yu purchased a five-year-old Buick van for 270,000 yuan—spacious, nine-seater, sturdy, albeit thirsty on fuel. The seller urged immediate paperwork, but Guan Yu deferred. “I’ll handle the transfer later.”

Post-purchase, he returned to where Lín Qiǎoqiǎo and others waited. Her uncle’s illness weighed heavily. Relieved to see the van, Lín trusted Guan Yu’s solutions implicitly. Their farm’s rickety三轮车 couldn’t have borne the journey.

After transferring the uncle onto a折叠床 in the van, they sought a clinic for fever-reducing injections before navigating toward Yáng City’s sprawling Lùkōng Hospital via GPS. Traffic snarls tested patience, but Guan Yu pressed on, even reaching out to contacts for hospital connections.

As the ordeal unfolded, the aunt whispered fears of village superstitions—sick men buried alive as “demon-possessed.” Guan Yu reassured her, “He’ll be fine. Trust me.”

Yet, in gridlocked streets near the hospital, frustration mounted. Lín suggested, “Call someone who can help smooth things ahead.”

Guan Yu tried allies—Du Xiǎojuān unanswered, then Gǎn Bǐlǐ, a resourceful contact. “I’m in Yáng City. Need assistance.”

The clock ticked, the uncle’s fever unyielding, as urban chaos mirrored their inner turmoil. Some battles required more than wheels—they demanded造化, the whims of fate itself.
