“Finally, everything seems settled,” Xiao Zhi said as they emerged from the main hall of Tiger Head Peak. “Father, why don’t you stay with me here tonight? Returning to Hanging Zenith Peak tomorrow won’t be too late.”

“No, I’ll head back now. I need to discuss the Qin Manor affairs with your mother,” Elder Zheng replied without turning. “You’ve traveled all day—rest early.”

As Elder Zheng strode away, Siqi asked worriedly, “Guan Yu, did we anger the Sect Master? He didn’t seem convinced by your words.”

“Of course he doubts,” Guan Yu said coldly. “I’ve said all I needed. Whether he believes me is his choice. If Cloud Azure Sect falls to ruin under his watch someday, it’s none of my concern.”

Xiao Zhi paled. “Guan Yu! Stop this reckless talk! If Sect Master Xuanming heard—”

“What’s the fuss? I care nothing for hollow formalities.” Guan Yu shrugged. “Still, I owe you both thanks for keeping Wang Xiaorong’s secret. That saved me trouble with Elder Xiang’s meddling.”

The trio had deliberately omitted Wang Xiaorong’s involvement—a crucial favor, given Elder Xiang’s relentless scrutiny.

“We know what to keep silent,” Xiao Zhi said, patting Guan Yu’s shoulder. “But tell me—do you truly think there are demonic spies among the Elders? Who do you suspect?”

Guan Yu hesitated. Accusing Elder Xiang outright would seem petty, given their known friction. “Who can say? Their disguises are flawless. No cracks show.” He sighed, surprised by his own concern for the sect. *Why bother? If demonic forces devour Cloud Azure, I’ll simply return to City A and live free.*

“Enough talk. I’m resting.” Guan Yu turned toward his quarters, ignoring Siqi’s troubled gaze. She longed to warn him against Wang Xiaorong—a disciple of the Soul Demon Sect—but couldn’t find the words. Though raised to despise demonic cultivators, Siqi couldn’t condemn Wang, who’d never harmed Cloud Azure. Yet how to make Guan Yu sever ties with her?

Exhausted from days of vigilance against Soul Demon ambushes, Guan Yu collapsed into bed, relishing Cloud Azure’s safety.

**Dreamscape**
“Xiaorong? Where… is this?” Guan Yu stood in a misty void, Wang Xiaorong materializing ahead.

“You summoned me here,” she teased, blushing. “Such a secluded spot… how bold!”

As she approached, Guan Yu’s pulse quickened. “This isn’t proper. Stay back—”

“Why fear?” She pressed against him, her form undulating like silk. “I’m already yours… won’t you take responsibility?”

His vision blurred as her warmth enveloped him. Suppressing hesitation, Guan Yu embraced her—

**Dawn Interruption**
“Guan Yu! Wake up!” Xiao Zhi’s pounding shook the door. “Sect Master summons us!”

Groggy, Guan Yu found a note by his pillow: *“Miss me? Meet tonight at Cloud Azure’s back mountain. I’ll wait forever. —Wang Xiaorong ♡”*

“Impossible!” he muttered. *Could she have entered Tiger Head Peak undetected?*

Xiao Zhi barged in. “You look haunted! Nightmares?”

“Just sleep-deprived,” Guan Yu lied, hiding the note. “Why this predawn summons?”

“Trouble again. That ‘rest’ you wanted? Forget it.”

**Tiger Head Peak Hall**
Sect Master Xuanming’s grim voice echoed: “Last night, intruders attempted to steal the Dragon Subduing Sword from our back mountain. Any knowledge of this?”

Guan Yu’s stomach dropped. *Xiaorong—did she...?*

“If caught, would we be here?” Ling Su, Xuanming’s disciple, sneered at Guan Yu.

“Mind your tone, Ling Su,” Guan Yu shot back. “Did I desecrate your ancestors?”

**Chapter 3566: Tempers Flare**

Elder Xiang stood, venom dripping. “This upstart mocks our laws! Sect Master, his incompetence and disrespect demand punishment!”

Elder Zheng countered, “Guan Yu has served Cloud Azure well. Who else retrieved the Eight Drums Scripture fragments?”

“Enough!” Guan Yu’s voice cut through. “Elder Xiang deems me useless? Then assign him all future tasks. I’ll retire to the back woods—let demonic cultivators finish me.”

The jab struck true—Elder Xiang’s disciples had recently been slaughtered in those woods, their killer still free.

“You dare?!” Elder Xiang roared. “A mere months-old disciple insults his superior! Elder Mu—what penalty for such insolence?”

Elder Mu hesitated, glancing at Xuanming. Guan Yu interjected, “Cloud Azure’s laws don’t bind me. Sect Master promised this when I joined. If unwelcome, I’ll return my artifacts and depart.”

Gasps filled the hall as Guan Yu produced the Soul Sunderer Blade, Imperial Seal, and Heaven Incinerator Furnace.

“Absurd!” Elder Xiang spat. “Sect laws govern all! Even me!”

Xuanming rose, weary. “I granted Guan Yu exemption to recruit him. He answers to me alone. Need I justify this to you, Elder Xiang?”

The revelation stunned the assembly. Elder Xiang seethed. “You jeopardize Cloud Azure for this... renegade!”

“Enough discord!” Xuanming thundered. “Guan Yu stays. This matter is closed.”

As tensions simmered, Guan Yu met Elder Xiang’s glare, unflinching. The battle lines were drawn.
