“Well, there’s no need to treat me to a meal. I have matters to attend to shortly, so I only came to visit Auntie today. Now that everything’s settled, I’ll just go in to bid her farewell before leaving.” Guan Yu spoke as she pushed open the door to the hospital room, eager to avoid prolonged interaction with Shuangshuang.

Moreover, Xue Jing stood nearby like a watchful tiger. Had Xue Jing not been present, things might have been different. A meal? Even arranging a private rendezvous would have been possible. But under these circumstances, caution was wiser—unless she wanted to risk being denied sleep tonight.

Upon reentering the room, Guan Yu saw Shuangshuang had already changed Auntie into fresh hospital attire. Approaching, she asked, “Auntie, how are you feeling now? More comfortable?”

Auntie smiled radiantly. “Thanks to you, Guan Yu. Had I not met you, I’d have lost all hope for my legs. You’ve given me a new lease on life. I truly don’t know how to repay you.”

“You flatter me, Auntie. I merely did what I could. No thanks are necessary. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave. I’ll return in ten days for further treatment.” Guan Yu replied courteously.

Before Guan Yu could finish, Qu Shuangshuang interjected eagerly, “Mom! I wanted to treat Guan Yu to dinner to thank him for all he’s done, but he keeps refusing! Please persuade him! After everything he’s done for us, we should properly express our gratitude!”

Shuangshuang’s tactic was shrewd. Having failed to convince Guan Yu herself, she now thrust the responsibility onto her mother.

Knowing Auntie’s temperament, Guan Yu anticipated she’d side with Shuangshuang. Sure enough, Auntie chimed in, “Guan Yu, since you’re already here and Shuangshuang’s free during summer break, why not accompany her for a meal? It would set my heart at ease. Whatever urgent matter you have can surely wait for a dinner. Won’t you grant me this face?”

Guan Yu glanced helplessly at Xue Jing, who pointedly looked out the window, refusing to engage.

“I truly have pressing business. How about this—when time permits, I’ll treat Shuangshuang to dinner and show her around the city. She has all summer, after all. But today isn’t feasible. Let’s postpone it.” Guan Yu declined again.

In truth, Auntie understood Shuangshuang’s intentions perfectly. Though young, Shuangshuang was already a bright college student, mature enough to comprehend her own feelings. The entire Qu family knew of Shuangshuang’s infatuation with Guan Yu—she’d pestered Ling’er countless times for his contact information, only to be repeatedly rebuffed.

Now that summer had brought Shuangshuang to the city, Ling’er could no longer evade her demands and finally relinquished Guan Yu’s number. The moment she obtained it, Shuangshuang called immediately, as restless as “ants on a hot pan” until she finally met him. She wouldn’t let him slip away easily now.

“Brother Guan Yu! However urgent your matters, surely a meal won’t delay you much? Won’t you grant Mom this courtesy? She’d practically kneel to beg you!” Shuangshuang accused as if Guan Yu were committing some grave offense.

Auntie recognized Shuangshuang’s determination to cling to Guan Yu. Not that she minded—what woman wouldn’t want such an exceptional man as their son-in-law? A match made in heaven! If Shuangshuang succeeded, it would be a tremendous blessing.

The Qu family’s interest wasn’t mercenary. They genuinely admired Guan Yu’s character. Auntie had even considered offering Shuangshuang to him in gratitude, but Guan Yu’s status made such proposals awkward. Now that Shuangshuang willingly pursued him, creating opportunities seemed prudent. Everyone understood her intentions—including Guan Yu himself.

What man wouldn’t desire such a youthful beauty? While Guan Yu, Auntie, and “the whole world” might approve, the women of Qiaoyuan District certainly wouldn’t. Take Xue Jing beside them—her visible disapproval offered no assistance, leaving Guan Yu to navigate this alone.

“Guan Yu, please dine with Shuangshuang today. It won’t take long, and it’s our way of showing gratitude.” Auntie pressed again.

Out of refusals, Guan Yu relented. “Very well. Since it’s nearly noon, let’s find a restaurant now.” His final words addressed Shuangshuang directly.

She leapt with joy upon hearing this. Xue Jing remained silent—under such circumstances, resistance seemed futile. Though aware Guan Yu would likely pay, she dismissed such concerns.

Watching her daughter’s elated bouncing, Auntie chuckled. “Shuangshuang, don’t dawdle over the meal. Don’t keep Guan Yu too long, understand?”

“Yes, yes! Don’t worry! I’ll bring back leftovers for you. We won’t be late!” Shuangshuang promised, yet secretly winked at her mother before gleefully following Guan Yu out.

Xue Jing sensed trouble brewing—the girl surely had ulterior motives. Though tempted to return to Qiaoyuan District, duty bound her to accompany them.

Seated in Guan Yu’s car, Shuangshuang and Xue Jing listened as he asked, “What would you like to eat?”

After pondering, Shuangshuang exclaimed, “I heard there’s a place with amazing steak! I’ve never had proper steak before—let’s go there!”

“Excellent choice.” Guan Yu drove toward Kaihuang High School, recalling a western restaurant opposite the campus he’d frequented with Wei Hongwei and Lü Mei during school days. Its steak had been exceptional—hopefully still was.

Ten minutes later, they parked outside the establishment. “This one,” Guan Yu announced upon exiting the vehicle.

Xue Jing recognized the place—Yuán’ǒu Steakhouse, known for its signature beef. During her Kaihuang days, she’d dined here too. Interestingly, their secret recipe had been replicated by Amei after one visit with Zhang Han and Xue Jing.

Amei possessed culinary genius, often experimenting while others gamed. Her creations inevitably ended with Zhang Han—the eternal taste-tester blessed with metabolism envied by all, especially figure-conscious Lü Mei who monitored her weight religiously.

Inside the nearly empty restaurant (summer break diminishing student patrons), Guan Yu chose a window table. Most remaining customers appeared to be Kaihuang students—odd during vacation until overhearing two young men behind them:

“That bastard Li Yuan teamed up with Chen Maosheng and even roped in Lan Zhe High’s Ge Yinglai! Can you believe their audacity?”

Guan Yu’s ears perked up. Li Yuan and Sun Zhi had been Kaihuang’s notorious bullies until he’d dealt with them. Was trouble brewing again?

“Chen Maosheng’s been haunting the cafeteria’s upper floor day and night, skipping classes. He’s the one who brought Ge Yinglai to exploit school girls there. Why doesn’t Sister Ji stop them? Because Chen spends fortunes there—more than we’ve seen in our lives! You think she’d bite the hand that feeds?”

“Last night, Ge forced himself on Number Seventeen—the new freshman who’s only sixteen! Sister Ji paid her off to hush it up. With Chen and Ge backing her, who’d dare intervene?”

“Worse—they’ve monopolized all the pretty girls! Even Feng Shaoye takes three or four at a time, cycling through them weekly. Money blinds even the principled ones. What chance do we have?”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. This required investigation.
