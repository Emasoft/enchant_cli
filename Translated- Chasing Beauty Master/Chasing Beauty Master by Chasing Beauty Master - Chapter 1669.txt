“Place your bets! Place your bets! Hurry up now, don’t dawdle! If you’re not anxious, others are!” The dealer’s dice cup had already been set on the table. Without hesitation, Lin Chen tossed two gold ingots onto the “Small” area. He was certain this round would open small—no mistake.

The woman beside him glanced his way and gave a thumbs-up. “Chubby kid, you’ve got guts! This is how gambling should be—thrilling! With your streak, losing’s impossible. But don’t think I’ll blindly follow your bets.”

**Chapter 4364: Cleaned Out**

She pushed her silver toward “Large.” Seeing the two of them split their bets, the others hesitated. Eventually, a few followed Lin Chen’s “Small,” but most sided with the woman’s “Large.” Her influence clearly held sway.

Though the crowd trusted her, Lin Chen and a handful stubbornly bet small out of spite. When the dice revealed “Large,” Lin Chen gaped in disbelief. “Damn it all! Unlucky again! Whatever I bet loses!”

The woman, having won substantially, chuckled. “Better stick with me, kid. Your luck’s rotten. How much gold do you have left to burn?”

Lin Chen forced a laugh. “No matter—just petty losses. Since the lady insists, I’ll follow your bet this round.”

Sweat beaded his brow. If he didn’t recoup his losses soon, he’d have to borrow from the backroom.

As the dealer shook the dice, the woman cried, “It’s Large again! Follow me, everyone! Hurry—bet heavy!”

Her rallying cry spurred the crowd. An old man shoved his entire stack forward. “All or nothing! Damn it, let’s gamble!”

Lin Chen added his last two gold ingots, praying inwardly: *Win this, or I’m ruined!*

“Bets closed!” The dealer lifted the cup—three fives glared back. Another triple.

Lin Chen jabbed a finger at the dealer. “You cheating bastard! Triples this often? Bullshit!”

The room erupted in anger. Heavy losses mounted, and no one stopped Lin Chen’s outburst—everyone seethed at the improbable streak.

The dealer ignored the curses, mechanically shaking the cup again. “Place your bets…”

“Can’t believe this!” the woman groaned. “I guessed the size right but missed the triples. Infuriating!”

Lin Chen stood hollow-eyed, stripped of every coin—his own silver and Guan Yu’s gold, all gone. Desperate, he whispered to the old man, “Anyone can borrow from the back? Any conditions?”

“Just sign a note. No fuss.” The man eyed him. “Need a loan?”

Lin Chen puffed his chest. “Merely out of pocket. Can’t leave mid-game—I’ll borrow a trifle.”

“Splendid! I’ll join you.” The old man led him toward a door.

At the threshold, Lin Chen gestured politely. “After you, elder. I’m new here—guide me.”

**Chapter 4365: Impersonation**

The room defied expectations—no thugs, no gloom. Sunset streamed through windows, bathing a young beauty in golden light.

She had an oval face, a mole accenting her lips, and a chic chin-length bob. Flawless features and porcelain skin left Lin Chen breathless. He discreetly straightened his robes.

The old man approached her. “Lost again. Need another loan.”

“Of course, Uncle. Your name, please?” Her voice melted like honey.

“Zhang Degui.”

She flipped through parchments. “You owe sixty taels, due in twenty days. How much today?”

Lin Chen watched, entranced. Such grace in a moneylender! The old man leered at her décolletage, drooling. Lin Chen stifled disgust.

“Twenty more, one-month term.”

“Sign here.” She handed him parchment. After he scrawled his name, she counted silver. “Enjoy your game.”

Zhang turned to Lin Chen. “See? Simple. Borrow what you need.”

Lin Chen scoffed. “I’ll have my steward deliver funds. No need for loans.”

“Suit yourself.” Zhang left.

The beauty smiled. “Seeking a loan, young master?”

“Lost eighty gold today,” Lin Chen lied. “Meant to fetch more, but that old man mentioned your favorable terms.”

“Our rules are posted.” She gestured to a wall plaque.

Lin Chen skimmed: short-term loans interest-free, longer terms with modest fees. *Perfect,* he schemed. *Borrow long-term, vanish to Yunqing Sect—free silver!*

“I’ll take a hundred taels. My steward will repay it by afternoon.”

“First-time borrowers need details: name, residence, family.”

Panicking, Lin Chen improvised. “I’m Ling Su. Father’s Lin Chen.”

“Different surnames?”

“I’m Lin Lingsu. Just ‘Ling Su’ to friends.”

She pressed. “Which Lin family in Liaozhou?”

His eyes darted, spotting an address on a parchment: Red Apricot Street. “We’re newcomers. Father runs a cloth shop there—Lin’s Textiles.”

“And the shop’s location?”

“Hongxing Street. Planning a tavern next.” His lies flowed smoothly.

**Chapter 4366: First Timer**

“First loans cap at one month,” she explained. “Repay promptly, build credit for longer terms.”

“Understood. I’ll repay tomorrow—no interest, yes?”

“Correct.” She handed him parchment. “Sign here.”

He scrawled “Ling Su.” As she fetched silver, he admired her poise. Beauty made even mundane acts entrancing.

Outside, Zhang Degui gloated to Ling Su: “Backroom’s for loans, not fun. Your friend’s borrowing to chase losses.”

Ling Su frowned. *Lin Chen wouldn’t squander group funds... Would he?*

Meanwhile, Lin Chen accepted the bulging sack, heart racing. The clerk’s perfume lingered as he left—a mix of jasmine and danger.
