“You can rest assured, this young man is excellent! I know—when those two delicate ladies were sent to his door, he actually refused and sent them away!” Upon hearing his wife question Guan Yu’s character, Du Xueheng hurriedly defended him.

He knew his wife’s temperament all too well—proud, with sky-high standards, looking down on most people. If she truly offended Guan Yu, causing him displeasure, their daughter’s grand opportunity and his own career’s golden chance would vanish like smoke. After all, with Guan Yu’s current wealth, what kind of woman couldn’t he find? A mere wave of his hand would summon crowds of women vying for his attention. Moreover, a young man treated as an honored guest by Li Yunshan, the jade tycoon, was destined for unimaginable future success.

“What? Ladies? What ladies? Explain yourself!” Du Xiaojuan’s mother glared fiercely at Du Xueheng.

“Huh? Who said anything about ladies?” Du Xueheng’s heart sank. Damn his loose tongue—he’d accidentally mentioned the escorts arranged during their trip to Yunnan!

**Chapter 235: Rented for Twenty Million**

“You said it! Just now! Wenwen, you heard him, right?” Du Xiaojuan’s mother turned angrily to Du Wen in the back seat.

“Hmm? I… didn’t hear anything,” Du Wen mumbled, shrinking her neck and shooting Du Xueheng a sympathetic glance.

Du Xueheng coughed, inwardly relieved.

“Explain! Did Guan Yu hire escorts?”

“No! After winning the jade gamble, Mr. Li arranged it, but Guan Yu refused!”

“And you? Did *you* take them?”

“What does that have to do with me? I’d have wanted to, but I wasn’t the one who won!” Du Xueheng retorted without blinking.

As they bickered during the drive, the topic shifted from Guan Yu to Du Xueheng’s past indiscretions during business trips.

Upon arriving at the hotel, Du Xueheng bolted to Guan Yu’s side, pulling him ahead discreetly. “Whatever you do, don’t mention the escorts Mr. Li arranged for you and Niu Le that night in Yunnan!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Relax. I’d never breathe a word—not even to Xiaojuan.”

“Good! Let’s drink—no stopping till we’re drunk!” Du Xueheng wiped his brow, feigning enthusiasm.

At the lavish dinner, Du Xueheng charmed Niu Le and Guan Yu while the women conversed quietly across the table. Eventually, Du Xueheng broached his company’s financial crisis.

“Li Yunshan promised help, but I haven’t dared to ask. We’re… struggling with cash flow,” he admitted awkwardly.

“No problem. I’ll call him. How much do you need?”

“Twenty million would suffice!” Du Xueheng’s eyes lit up.

Guan Yu nodded. “Done. I’ll talk to him after dinner.” With over a hundred million in red jade shares from Li Yunshan, twenty million was trivial.

The sum didn’t faze Guan Yu. As Du Xiaojuan’s father, supporting him was natural if he intended to keep her. Though steep, his money-making prowess made it manageable.

“Then Xiaojuan won’t need to transfer schools?”

“Of course not! I’m perfectly happy with her staying by your side!” Du Xueheng beamed, overjoyed by Guan Yu’s pledge.

Guan Yu glanced at Du Xiaojuan. “Also, she’ll stop dorming. I’ve bought a villa near campus—she’s been staying there lately. Her roommates were… problematic. Any objections?”

“None! Having her with you is ideal. Just tolerate her occasional mischief!” Du Xueheng agreed instantly, silencing his wife’s protests.

Throughout the meal, Du Xueheng eagerly endorsed every suggestion, behaving more like an obsequious subordinate than a future father-in-law.

As they parted, Du Xiaojuan’s mother tried to take her home for a heart-to-heart, but the girl clung to Guan Yu’s arm. “I… should return to the villa. I’ll visit you soon.”

“Let her stay! She’s safe and happy there,” Du Xueheng interjected.

Just like that, Guan Yu resolved Du Xiaojuan’s worries with twenty million.

On their way home, Du Xiaojuan’s mother fumed until learning of Guan Yu’s financial aid and future jade ventures. Instantly mollified, she brightened—proof of money’s power to sway opinions.

Back at the villa, Du Xiaojuan hugged Guan Yu adoringly. “You’re amazing! They actually agreed!”

Guan Yu pinched her cheek. “Don’t celebrate yet. I’ve only rented you for twenty million. If I go broke, they might drag you back!”

“Never! I’d follow you even if you begged on streets. I’ll escape again if they try!” she declared fiercely.

Touched, Guan Yu chuckled. “Deal. No one takes you from me.”

As they vowed loyalty, Niu Le and Luo Cheng teased, “Should we leave you two alone?”

Blushing, Du Xiaojuan hid a smile while Guan Yu redirected the conversation to Luo Cheng about upcoming business launches.

**Chapter 236: Uninvited Guests**

Choosing the nearest Saturday for the grand opening, Guan Yu gathered everyone to discuss plans.

“After launching Luo Cheng’s ventures, I’ll return to school. Xiaojuan, you’re coming. Niu Le—staying here or joining us?”

Niu Le hesitated, reluctant to abandon his leisurely life but finally agreed to follow Guan Yu.

With millions to invest, Guan Yu planned larger enterprises but cautioned against overreliance on gambling luck.

Leaving guest lists to Luo Cheng, Guan Yu expected only small local gangs at the opening.

Come Saturday, the venues buzzed with flower arches and firecrackers. As Guan Yu arrived, Feng Xin called—she and her grandfather were en route despite not being invited.

Panicking, Luo Cheng upgraded arrangements while Guan Yu fretted over Du Xiaojuan’s jealousy.

Soon, Feng Lao arrived, followed by Xu Lao and other retired underworld patriarchs with their successors—all uninvited but deferential.

**Chapter 237: Old Grudges**

The influx of legendary figures stunned Luo Cheng. Guan Yu, having saved these elders from a poisoning plot, now commanded their collective respect—a force eclipsing even the vanished Xu family.

As Xu Lao’s white BMW arrived, Feng Lao sneered, “Who else dresses head-to-toe in white like a pretentious peacock?”

Guan Yu marveled at the turnout. These titans’ presence transformed his humble opening into an event that reshaped Nanjing’s underworld hierarchy overnight.
