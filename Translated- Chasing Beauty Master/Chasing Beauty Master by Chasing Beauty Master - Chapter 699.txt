“You killed them, so you shall be cast into eternal damnation and reduced to nothingness!” Xue Jing coldly declared to Demon Fang. With a flick of her wrist, a violet-blue beam shot from her fingertips toward the demon's forehead.

Demon Fang, having lost all his earlier ferocity, seemed utterly devoid of confidence to confront Xue Jing. Though desperate to flee, his greed for the Aqua Primordial rooted him in place. Hastily raising both hands to shield his forehead, he twisted his head sideways in a futile attempt to evade the attack.

Chapter 1773: Ice Maiden

Though Xue Jing's current strength merely reached Saint Sovereign level compared to Demon Fang's Peak Realm Sovereign cultivation, the demon displayed no will to resist. An innate divine aura radiating from Xue Jing's form exerted natural suppression over demonic entities - a primordial dominance no mere cultivation gap could overcome.

*Thud!*

The beam pierced clean through Demon Fang's palms before embedding itself in the ice with a needle-thin hole of unfathomable depth. White smoke curled from the demon's perforated hands, Xue Jing's spiritual energy having inflicted wounds beyond natural healing.

"ARGH!"

The demon's agonized scream echoed as he whirled toward the Aqua Primordial, intent on seizing the treasure and escaping. Xue Jing instantly gave chase, materializing a violet-blue spiritual sword akin to Guan Yu's technique - though her blade's aura, while weaker in raw power, demonstrated far superior swordsmanship.

This mastery clearly originated neither from Guan Yu's teachings nor her own cultivation. Like instinctual memory, the techniques flowed through her without conscious thought.

Demon Fang's claw closed around the Aqua Primordial as his form dissolved into black mist, attempting to flee through the ice cavern. But Xue Jing was already within two zhang distance. Her extended blade, augmented by sword qi, stabbed deep into the swirling darkness.

"AAAH!"

The mist coalesced back into Demon Fang's corporeal form with a thunderous crash against the ice, landing less than a meter from the hole where Guan Yu lay buried.

Upon fully materializing earlier, Xue Jing hadn't immediately noticed Guan Yu's presence. Now spotting his hair protruding from the ice, her heart constricted. The spiritual sword vanished as she arrowed toward the frozen cavity.

Mistaking her target, Demon Fang abandoned the dropped Aqua Primordial in panicked flight. Xue Jing ignored him completely, collapsing at the ice hole's edge. Trembling hands cradled Guan Yu's hair as she cried, "Husband! Husband!"

No response came from the frozen depths.

"Jones! What's happened to my husband?" Xue Jing whirled around seeking answers, only to discover Jones crushed beneath five ice bears.

The human emotions that had flooded back upon seeing Guan Yu's hair now overwhelmed her. Knees cracking against ice, she pressed her face against her husband's frozen visage. Pearlescent tears fell with crystalline *ting* sounds, each droplet a chime of anguish.

Her wails of remorse echoed through the cavern - self-reproach for not awakening sooner, for failing to share life's final moments or death's cold embrace. The lamentations continued until interrupted by a rasping voice:

"Ice Maiden... You still possess human sentiment? You retain mortal attachments?"

Xue Jing turned instinctively, exclaiming, "The Wanderer? Why are you here?"

She didn't understand how she recognized the voice's owner, having heard it twice before without recollection. Now, familiarity flooded her being as memories merged - Xue Jing's consciousness intertwining with the Ice Maiden's legacy.

"Ho! Why am I here?" chuckled the voice. A white-bearded elder materialized beside the Illusory Heaven Pearl. "Had I not preserved your wisp of divine sense within this world's Aqua Primordial, you'd have scattered to the void. This rebirth grants vengeance's chance!"

As the elder spoke, Xue Jing's demeanor shifted - playful innocence harmonizing with regal divinity, mortal and immortal aspects coalescing.

"You 'saved' me?" she sneered with the Ice Maiden's icy contempt. "State your true purpose plainly. I'll cooperate only after you revive my husband, Jones, and the bears."

The elder sighed. "I rue devising this fusion of wills. Fear not - the boy's 'death' serves his benefit. True demise..." His voice turned grim. "...is a luxury denied to beings like us."

Xue Jing recoiled. "Benefit? Then why not let demons slaughter you?"

"A tempting thought!" Bitter laughter echoed. "But death flees those who most crave it. You understand - the true horror isn't dying, but being trapped between existence and oblivion."

Though unspoken, Xue Jing recognized the truth in his words. "You seek to use us for your own release?"

"Not just release!" The elder's eyes blazed. "Our enemies revel in stolen glory while we linger in shadows. We'll cultivate seeds of destruction in this forgotten realm, toppling them from celestial thrones! Join me, Ice Maiden!"

Xue Jing arched an eyebrow. "You never plant single seeds. Who else awakens?"

"The Five Primordials harbor familiar souls. You'll know them in time." The elder's form flickered. "My consciousness wanes. First, let's revive your companions."

Golden light cascaded from his gesture, infusing Guan Yu, Jones, and the ice bears.

Chapter 1777: Face

Since losing his memories, Guan Yu's world had simplified. His lovers cherished the present version, acquaintances adapted, none dwelling on the past.

For Han Qiao, humiliation burned hotter than anger. Being floored before goddess Lü Mei outweighed physical pain. He barked orders at his lackeys: "Teach this upstart a lesson!"

Though retaining only partial cultivation, Guan Yu remained formidable against second-rate mutants - let alone ordinary youths. The hesitant cronies exchanged nervous glances. Their "Strongman Han" lay defeated - what hope had they?

Classmates recorded the scene on phones - the new student flooring the campus strongman trending instantly. Speculations flew:

"That's Han Qiao! His father's vice-chair of the International Association!"

"Pity the fool - temporary victory brings long-term suffering."

Under Han Qiao's threats, four lackeys charged. Guan Yu's casual kick sent a desk careening into them, bowling over the group.

"Trash!" Han Qiao roared, hefting a desk for a crushing blow. Gasps filled the classroom as Lü Mei shielded her eyes.

Guan Yu pivoted smoothly, sweeping Han Qiao's legs. The brute crashed down, nose smashing against desk edge in a bloody ruin.

As Guan Yu raised his foot for a face-crushing stomp, Lü Mei's cry halted him: "Mercy breeds peace!"

"Does kindness deter wolves?" Guan Yu countered. "Had I been ordinary, would they show leniency?"

Lü Mei's gaze hardened. "I detest violence."

Recognizing trauma behind her aversion, Guan Yu relented. "For our beauty's sake-"

"WHAT'S THIS COMMOTION?" A shrill voice interrupted. The effeminate teacher minced in, fussing over Han Qiao. "Assaulting students? There'll be legal consequences!"

Guan Yu ignored him, collecting compensation money from the lackeys. "For the damaged furniture," he stated, depositing cash before the teacher.

Lü Mei approached, whispering thanks. Her rare smile electrified the room.

Chapter 1778: The Omniscient

As the crowd dispersed, whispers continued:

"Did you see? Ice Queen Lü Mei smiled!"

"New kid's dead meat. Han's dad could buy this school!"

Unnoticed in the commotion, a bespectacled youth sidled up to Guan Yu. "Name's Bai Xiaosheng - The Omniscient. Care for some... enlightening information?"
