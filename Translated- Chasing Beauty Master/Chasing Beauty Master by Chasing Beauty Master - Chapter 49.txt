“Are you done yet? Had enough of ogling, you pervert!” Liu Shilei scolded with feigned anger, her cheeks flushed.

“They all look lovely. Why not try them on for me?” Guan Yu teased with a roguish grin.

“Get lost… Are you trying to kill me? It still burns down there!” Pouting, Liu Shilei rubbed herself tenderly. This rascal had been too rough… though truth be told, she’d been the one urging him to go faster and harder. Ahem.

Guan Yu lay sprawled on the Simmons mattress, repeatedly attempting to peek under the covers until Liu Shilei pinched him several times. Through a mix of threats and coaxing, she finally managed to dress beneath the sheets.

Freshly deflowered, Liu Shilei emerged intending to wash her soaked underwear and stockings while changing the bedsheets. But after two steps, she gasped sharply, clutching herself painfully as she shot Guan Yu an accusational glare—his handiwork was unmistakable.

Clearing his throat awkwardly, Guan Yu helped her sit. “Rest now. I’ll handle the cleaning.”

A child of poverty learns domestic skills early. With his father often busy, household chores had long been Guan Yu’s domain. Changing linens and washing posed no challenge.

Watching him efficiently tidy the room, Liu Shilei hid a secret smile. This domestic harmony felt wonderfully warm.

As Guan Yu worked, Liu Shilei’s phone rang.

“Oh no… I forgot to inform my supervisor!” She grimaced, smacking her forehead.

After explaining her “sudden illness” to the school administrator and arranging substitute coverage, she hung up and glared at Guan Yu. “That wretched school doctor! How despicable!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Let it go. Just avoid him henceforth. Besides”—his tone softened—“without his meddling, I’d never have gained such a beautiful, caring wife.”

“Who’s your wife?” Liu Shilei retorted like a bashful schoolgirl, though sweetness flooded her heart. Never having romanced before, she stubbornly denied her joy.

Guan Yu chuckled, letting the matter drop.

Glancing at the clock—not yet 10 AM—he recalled his plan to profit at the antique market. But abandoning Liu Shilei in her weakened state felt heartless.

Afternoon then, he decided. Kicking off his sneakers, he slid under the covers.

“Ah! What are you—?” Liu Shilei’s face burned crimson. Though intimately acquainted now, sharing a bed so abruptly still flustered her.

“Just holding you. I love your scent.” Wrapping his arms around her soft form, Guan Yu breathed in her feminine fragrance—a blissful, comforting aroma. He wished time could freeze this perfect moment.

Liu Shilei nestled against his chest, savoring newfound security. For all her delicate appearance, she’d maintained steely independence since university, keeping countless suitors at bay—a habit ingrained since childhood.

Initially viewing Guan Yu as a younger brother, she’d admired his good heart despite occasional temper. Yet fate had entwined them beyond expectation.

Chapter 117: Becoming Your Wife?

By noon, Liu Shilei rose to prepare lunch.

“Let me help.” Guan Yu embraced her waist from behind.

“You? Cook?” She bumped his forehead playfully. When his hands wandered, she slapped them away. “Behave! What if someone sees?”

“There’s no one here.”

“Bad habits start somewhere. Go play on the computer.” She pushed him toward the bed.

“Truly don’t need help?”

“Men shouldn’t cook. I’ll pamper you into a plump little prince!” Her eyes sparkled with mischief.

Guan Yu snorted—plump princes being sons, not lovers. Researching antique markets online, he mapped his afternoon plans.

Meanwhile, Mo Ling returned with colleagues after classes. Finding Guan Yu present, she froze—he’d been avoiding her since their harsh exchange.

“Class over?” Liu Shilei asked casually.

“Yes… Are you better? Did the medicine help?”

“Much improved—Guan Yu brought it.” She glanced at her absorbed lover.

Mo Ling seized the cooking basin. “You should rest! And you”—she turned to Guan Yu—“making her cook while ill? Why aren’t you in class?”

“Took leave.” His terse reply hung awkwardly.

The meal passed quietly until dishes needed washing.

“Let me—”

“You?” Mo Ling arched a brow. “Want to tour the women’s restroom?”

After she left, Liu Shilei cornered Guan Yu. “What’s between you two?”

“She dislikes me.”

Liu Shilei studied him, then huffed and turned away.

“What’s wrong?”

“Nothing.”

Baffled by her sudden coldness, Guan Yu tilted her chin. “Annoyed with me?”

“You’re hiding things! What happened with Mo Ling?”

Caught off-guard by her intuition, Guan Yu stammered. “Just… misunderstandings. Jealous?”

“Of course not! I just hate being kept in the dark.”

After extracting promises of future honesty, Liu Shilei softened. “If you find someone better…”

“Marry someone else? Never!” Guan Yu glowered.

Chapter 118: The Best Is Yet to Come

Liu Shilei giggled at his outrage. “I just want your happiness. If you marry, I’ll be your lover—whatever you decide.”

“You are my happiness,” he growled.

Relenting, she kissed his cheek. “Then I’m yours. Now attend class!”

“Actually… I need leave this afternoon.”

“First day skipping class? For what?”

“Urgent matters. Two days max.”

After stern warnings about academic priorities, she relented. At the doorway, Guan Yu demanded a proper goodbye kiss.

“Someone might—”

“Remember our office passion?”

Blushing furiously, she pecked his lips. “Now go!”

Descending stairs, Guan Yu encountered Mo Ling.

“Wait!” She hesitated. “I… overreacted before. Truce?”

Stunned by her apology, he nodded. “No hard feelings.”

“Friends?” She smiled tentatively.

“Friends.”

As they parted, neither noticed Liu Shilei watching from above, her expression unreadable. The curtain rose on a complex drama yet unfolding.
