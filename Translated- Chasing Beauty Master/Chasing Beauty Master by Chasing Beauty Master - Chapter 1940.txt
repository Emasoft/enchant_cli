Everything the Right Envoy had said was well within Wang Xiaorong’s expectations. The Demon Lord would naturally prioritize her protection above all else.

Wang Xiaorong remarked, “The Duan family knowing the location of the East Sea—this information should never have leaked. They’ve always been extremely secretive. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have allowed Duan Ruxue to join this dangerous venture.”

The Right Envoy glanced subtly at Guan Yu before continuing, “Therefore, there must be a traitor among you. This traitor likely doesn’t belong to any of our factions. The way the information spread immediately after being obtained clearly shows malicious intent to endanger your lives.”

Guan Yu nodded. The presence of a traitor was undeniable. Excluding himself, Wang Xiaorong, and Qiqi, the remaining suspects were those who had known the secret early on. Duan Ruxue couldn’t be the traitor, nor could Patriarch Duan. Jiang Yuankai was equally unlikely. That left only Jiang Yuankai’s subordinates—Xiao Wu and his men.

“So the traitor must be among Xiao Wu’s group,” Guan Yu concluded. “Their goal is likely to eliminate Jiang Yuankai and seize the East Sea Dragon Pearl. Though it’s too late to prevent the leak, we can’t allow this danger to remain in our ranks.”

He added, “This traitor acts for personal gain, unaffiliated with any faction. Had it been someone from the Demonic Soul Sect, they would’ve reported to the Demon Lord first rather than spreading the news everywhere.”

“How terrifying,” Qiqi interjected. “To think we’ve been harboring a traitor all this time without noticing!”

Guan Yu recalled their previous ambush in the town where Xiao Wu’s group had been captured. The Grassland Eleven Brothers were likely brought by this traitor to ensure their complete annihilation, leaving the path clear to claim the East Sea treasure. Though the plot failed and the captives revealed nothing before being imprisoned in the capital’s dungeons, interrogating them might expose the traitor.

Guan Yu resolved to discuss this privately with Jiang Yuankai, hoping he could prepare countermeasures before their departure from Twin Cities.

The Right Envoy warned, “With the entire martial world now aware, every faction will mobilize. The road ahead grows perilous. Guan Yu, you must protect the Young Mistress at all costs.”

“Of course,” Guan Yu vowed. “I’d lay down my life before letting harm come to Xiaorong or Qiqi.”

“I believe you,” the Right Envoy said, though her expression remained troubled. She withheld concerns about the impending conflict between the Azure Cloud Sect’s Leader Xuanming and the Demon Lord—a confrontation where even Guan Yu might struggle to protect Wang Xiaorong.

The East Sea treasure’s allure had drawn unprecedented attention. The Crimson Lotus Sect mass-recruited disciples, while their formidable formations posed a unique threat. Combined with Azure Cloud Sect’s forces, the Demonic Soul Sect faced daunting odds, though the Demon Lord remained resolute.

Suddenly, the Right Envoy posed a grave question: “Guan Yu, if Xuanming ordered you to kill the Young Mistress, which would you choose—your sect or her?”

“Xiaorong, without hesitation,” Guan Yu answered smoothly. “I joined Azure Cloud by chance, not devotion. To me, she outweighs any sect allegiance. Xuanming treats me well, but I remain merely a pawn in his schemes.”

Pleased, the Right Envoy pressed further: “And if the Demon Lord clashed with Xuanming? The Young Mistress would aid her father. What then?”

“I’d avoid such conflicts entirely,” Guan Yu replied. “Though I know Xiaorong cannot abandon her father, I’d persuade her to leave with me beforehand.” He recognized the impracticality—defying both sects would brand him a traitor, yet harming the Demon Lord was unthinkable as Wang Xiaorong’s beloved.

The Right Envoy nodded approval. “If that day comes, take her far from the battlefield.”

“Aunt Right Envoy, does this mean...” Wang Xiaorong trailed off, realization dawning.

“Yes. The Demon Lord marches personally to claim the treasure,” the envoy confirmed.

Guan Yu’s eyebrows shot up. “He’s taking this seriously?”

“Utterly. The treasure’s legendary wealth could bankroll his ambition to unite the martial world,” the envoy explained. “Though its existence is unproven, the stakes justify his presence. All major sects mobilize—the Crimson Lotus’s Sun Lianzi likely joins, and Xuanming may bring the Hidden Dragon Sword.”

Qiqi nervously suggested abandoning the expedition, but Guan Yu refused: “We travel with Duan Ruxue and Jiang Yuankai—the pathfinder and Dragon Pearl bearer. Turning back now would make them targets.”

The envoy concurred. “They’re trapped by their roles. A tragic fate for those merely seeking riches.”

As discussions turned to the Dragon Pearl’s origin, Guan Yu recounted discovering it in Mount Wu Jian’s mysterious cave—a location later investigators failed to rediscover. Speculation arose about demonic manipulation, potentially luring humans to unearth treasures for otherworldly forces.

“If demonic beings appear,” Guan Yu asserted, “mortal factions should unite against them first.”

The Right Envoy nodded. “A noble sentiment, but let’s not borrow trouble. These remain conjectures.”

Qiqi’s innocent question about demonic appearances sparked darker contemplations. Guan Yu maintained hope: “With all sects’ elites gathered, even demons couldn’t withstand united opposition.”

Yet unease lingered. The East Sea voyage promised not just treasure, but a crucible that would test alliances, loyalties, and the very boundaries between mortal and demonic realms.
