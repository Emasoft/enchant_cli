“That’s certain. There’s something you still don’t know—living here, we’re unaware of the hardships outside.” Du Teng took a sip of wine and continued, “There are martial arts fanatics who lack the silver to stay here. To challenge the Swordless Immortal conveniently, they camp outside the inn.”

“Outside? I haven’t seen any houses,” Guan Yu remarked curiously.

“They wander the woods. Without silver, they dare not cause trouble here. The owner of Swordless Inn is no ordinary man. For years, not a single soul has stirred trouble here—not even the imperial palace rivals its peace.”

Hearing this, Guan Yu realized the truth. Though the innkeeper remained unseen, all understood he was someone not to be trifled with. Moreover, most guests were seasoned martial masters engrossed in cultivation. Few would dare provoke chaos here.

Guan Yu asked, “Brother Du, if you defeat the Swordless Immortal tomorrow, what then?”

“I’ll continue cultivating. Victory would be my greatest encouragement—fuel for my martial path.”

“It won’t be so simple. You’d face endless challenges, leaving no time for cultivation.”

**Chapter 4118: Perfection Incarnate**

Guan Yu pondered: These challengers sought to topple the Swordless Immortal, but what meaning lay in becoming the next ‘World’s Supreme’? One would merely inherit an endless cycle of duels. Were it him, he’d never risk such a path without absolute confidence. Victory brought ceaseless trouble; defeat meant death—a losing gamble either way.

Though wishing to dissuade Du Teng, Guan Yu knew mere words wouldn’t sway a man who’d spent fifty years honing his skills and half a month preparing mentally. Still, he tried: “Brother Du, why go? If you don’t seek the title, why court danger?”

“Hahaha!” Du Teng laughed heartily. “Earlier I advised you—now you return the favor. I’ve meditated here peacefully for half a month awaiting tomorrow… Yet this rainy night’s conversation makes me question the worth of risking my life.”

“Exactly! Letting go is wisest,” Guan Yu said cheerfully, mistaking Du’s hesitation for surrender. “Victory or defeat holds no meaning here. Why proceed?”

“Yet…not going would haunt me.” Du Teng’s voice turned grave. “Without facing him, my skills will stagnate. The Swordless Immortal’s shadow would forever loom over my progress.”

Guan Yu frowned—this dilemma offered no clean solution. “What of stagnation? Your current prowess suffices anywhere. Why gamble everything for empty glory?”

Du Teng wavered visibly, torn between reason and an inexplicable pull toward the mountain—as if the Swordless Immortal himself beckoned. Guan Yu understood this restless drive, feeling a similar itch to test his own limits, though unprepared.

Rumors painted the Swordless Immortal as peerless, his skills transcendent. While confident in escaping ordinary masters, Guan Yu knew the Swordless Manor’s mysteries could prove fatal. He recalled tales of sinister energy-draining techniques—perhaps challengers never returned because their vitality was siphoned? If the Immortal practiced such forbidden arts, defeat meant more than death; it fueled his malevolence.

Yet these were mere speculations. “Brother Du,” Guan Yu finally said, “I advise against this, but won’t force you. If resolved, I’ll support you.”

“Thank you, brother. Orphaned young, I’ve walked this martial path alone. Confronting him…it’s how I prove my life’s dedication wasn’t wasted.”

“But must it be him? Any duel could serve as proof!”

Du Teng nodded. “Yet for true warriors, not any opponent suffices. Only by facing the pinnacle can one find peace, win or lose.”

Knowing further persuasion futile, Guan Yu drank with him before parting. “Tomorrow, let me accompany you up the mountain—to lend my support.”

“Agreed. I’ll await you here at dawn.” Du Teng vanished into the rain, leaving Guan Yu to return to his quarters.

**Chapter 4119: A Flicker of Hope**

The creaking door roused Wang Xiaorong. Though midnight, she’d left it unlocked for Guan Yu’s return. Seeing him drenched, she sprang up. “Change your clothes! I’ll fetch hot water—you’ll catch cold!”

“No need. Forgive me for disturbing your sleep.” Guan Yu smiled warmly, lifting a lidded bucket. “I brought hot water from the hearth.”

Ignoring him, Xiaorong poured water into a basin and wrung a steaming towel. “Sit. Let me.” Her tone brooked no argument.

Guan Yu complied, touched by her care. This pampered young mistress now tending to him—a first for them both. His thoughts drifted to Qiao Yuan District: were he there, four or five beauties would fuss over him, particularly clingy Zhang Han who’d nestle in his arms like a child. How long since he’d visited? He wondered about Yu Gang’s affairs and the absent Zhiyu Lang—that rascal deserved a scolding!

“The rain persists. We’re stranded tomorrow,” Guan Yu mused.

Xiaorong handed him dry robes. “I pray Prince Zou departs at dawn—so you’ll leave too, spared from this madness.”

“Let’s hope.” Guan Yu chuckled ruefully. Her lingering anxiety pained him.

“Wait! You went out undisguised?” she suddenly gasped. “What if someone recognized you?”

“Fear not. In this storm, who’d notice? None here know my ties to the prince. I’ll disguise anew when he departs.” He explained how rainwater ruined their leather masks unless perfected—a skill learned from Xiao Qi.

Xiaorong relented. “Still…be cautious.”

“Enough. Rest now.” As she obediently lay down, Guan Yu’s mind wandered to distant Qiao Yuan—and the enigmatic Swordless Manor looming ahead.

**Chapter 4120: Clash of Masters**

Yan Zhao arrived at a Demon Soul Sect outpost in Fugu Town, bedraggled and seething. Overseen by Xiao Qi, this branch now fell under Yan Zhao’s command as altar master—a position now jeopardized by his botched assassination and exposed identity.

Xiao Qi sneered at his disheveled state. “Stealing chickens, Master Altar Leader? How…heroic.”

Yan Zhao shot him a venomous glare. “Fetch hot water. Can’t you see I’m injured?”

Complying reluctantly, Xiao Qi seethed inwardly. How dare this traitor—a mere turncoat from Cloud Azure Sect—lord over him? Let the wretch perish!

The shoulder wound tormented Yan Zhao—a festering arrow injury from Guan Yu’s peculiar dart. Despite the Left Envoy’s treatment, the mysterious toxin defied antidotes. Now aggravated, it bled anew, a throbbing reminder of past humiliations.

After tending the wound, Yan Zhao plotted. His exposed status spelled doom unless he eliminated Prince Zou swiftly. Only success could redeem him. Denial was his sole defense—without proof, the Demon Soul Sect might disavow him. But failure meant expulsion from both sect and righteous circles—a death sentence.
