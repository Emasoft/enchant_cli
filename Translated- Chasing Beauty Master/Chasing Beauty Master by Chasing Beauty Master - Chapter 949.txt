The two men clashed. Though Ge Yinglai's attacks were visually impressive, they posed not the slightest threat to Guan Yu. Ge had believed his own speed unparalleled, yet shockingly, Guan Yu moved even faster.

Each of Ge Yinglai's strikes seemed telegraphed in advance, as though the duel had been choreographed. Guan Yu effortlessly blocked every blow, their exchange resembling a rehearsed dance.

As the fight dragged on, Ge Yinglai grew visibly more enraged, exacerbated by Guan Yu's taunts:
“Too slow.”
“Pathetic strikes. Did you skip breakfast?”

The provocations stoked Ge’s fury, yet despite his Second-Class Eminent Mid-Rank cultivation—a tier that should have guaranteed dominance—he found himself outmaneuvered at every turn. Guan Yu hadn’t even activated his protective shield.

Suddenly, Ge Yinglai’s silhouette split into two identical figures before Guan Yu’s eyes. “An illusion?” Guan Yu murmured, intrigued. What began as an even match now tilted as Ge’s technique multiplied—two becoming four, then four encircling Guan Yu with eight arms against his two.

Guan Yu recognized this Shadow Clone Technique, eerily reminiscent of Uncle Qing’s method. Yet Ge’s version proved superior: four flawless replicas, each retaining over eighty percent of the original’s power, their true bodies indistinguishable.

Forced to retreat, Guan Yu activated his Eggshell Shield, its crystalline barrier shimmering. “Impressive clones, Boss Ge,” he called. “Might I inquire about your master’s name?”

“Save questions for after the fight!” The four Ges chorused, hands weaving identical seals. A blinding light coalesced before them, condensing into four radiant swords that shot toward Guan Yu—all within ten seconds, a feat that would take ordinary cultivators half a minute.

The crowd blinked as the swords struck... only to see Ge Yinglai stagger, blood erupting from his lips. Guan Yu stood unscathed. “You underestimated my shield’s reflection ability,” he said coldly. “Blind ambition blinded you to consequences.”

Ge clutched his chest, spiritual energy raging uncontrollably within. “I... underestimated you,” he gasped. “But how?”

“Arrogance and impatience,” Guan Yu replied. “A warrior’s heart must be still water, not stormy seas.”

Unnoticed by most, a black-clad observer vanished from the taekwondo hall’s upper floor—a mystery figure Ge briefly sought before conceding defeat with grudging respect. “You’ve won. My lack of real combat experience... it showed.”

As Guan Yu departed with Wei Hongwei and the rescued Jia Bo, Wei chattered excitedly: “Boss! Those four clones! Those swords! And Ge just... *bleh*! Blood everywhere! You’re invincible!”

Xue Jing rolled her eyes. “Enough flattery. Contact Lü Mei—check on Qian Yaoyao.”

The subsequent reconciliation proved messy. At Yaoyao’s home, Wei Hongwei knelt penitently until Guan Yu’s strategic cough about “leg injuries” melted her resolve. Tears flowed, accusations flew, and Jia Bo became the scapegoat: “It was my fault! I dragged Wei to the cafeteria!”

When Yaoyao’s brother Qian Yunqing returned, he found himself vilified for disciplining Wei. “You brute!” Yaoyao scolded. “Look at his face! His leg!”

Yunqing threw up his hands. “I defend your honor, and this is my thanks? Never again!”

Guan Yu mediated with amused diplomacy, cementing the truce. As wounds were tended, Yaoyao fretted over Wei’s bruises while Jia Bo endured sidelong glares.

“Typical,” Xue Jing muttered to Guan Yu. “They’ll forget this drama by tomorrow.”

“Until next time,” Guan Yu agreed, watching the reunited couple. Some lessons, he knew, required repeating.
