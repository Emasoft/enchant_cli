During lunch, Guan Yu said, “A’cai, from now on, you must study diligently under Jinci Xiansheng (Second to None). His entire being is steeped in cultivation. If you can learn even a fraction of his wisdom, your future will be boundless. Understand?”

A’cai set down his bowl and chopsticks, replying with firm resolve, “Elder Brother, rest assured. I will not disgrace you or trouble Jinci Xiansheng. You have my word.”

Guan Yu wasn’t worried about that. A’cai didn’t seem the type to stir trouble. Nodding, he turned to Second to Wolf and said, “Then A’cai is entrusted to you. Teach him in your own way. Don’t hesitate to let him endure hardships.”

“What are you saying?” Second to Wolf served himself a piece of meat. “I have high hopes for A’cai too. Since this is your request, I’d never let him suffer. After I take him back, I’ll arrange for him to enter secluded cultivation. His current cultivation level is too low to accompany me on journeys—it’d be too dangerous.”

Guan Yu nodded. This arrangement was ideal. He then asked, “Since you don’t disdain A’cai, why refuse to take him as a disciple? You’re alone—don’t you wish to pass on your legacy?” To Guan Yu, it was puzzling. Second to Wolf was willing to teach A’cai, yet insisted it was mere friendship rather than formal apprenticeship.

“I have my reasons,” Second to Wolf said hesitantly. “There are unresolved matters weighing on my mind. But rest assured, what I teach A’cai will be everything I’ve learned in my lifetime. I’ll hold nothing back.”

Guan Yu believed his sincerity. Yet if Second to Wolf was imparting his skills, wasn’t that tantamount to taking a disciple? Why insist it was mere mutual exchange between friends? Was there a hidden conflict? Or perhaps restrictions from his sect?

But as far as Guan Yu knew, Second to Wolf’s cultivation had been self-taught. This was why his strength as a First-Class Sovereign surpassed others of the same rank. He had no master or sect, relying solely on his own insights and serendipitous breakthroughs.

In battles between First-Class Sovereigns, Second to Wolf—currently at the mid-tier—could contend with upper-tier opponents. His unconventional application of cultivation, honed through personal enlightenment rather than rigid traditions, granted him exceptional prowess.

His unique methods, if passed to A’cai, combined with the latter’s innate talent, might one day elevate A’cai beyond Second to Wolf to become a peerless powerhouse.

Cultivation required time; there were no shortcuts. Attempting to hasten progress through dubious means invited backlash—unless blessed by rare fortune.

Yet some were born prodigies, akin to those with extraordinary intellect. Such talents frequently found breakthroughs, accelerating their growth—a privilege others couldn’t replicate through envy.

Second to Wolf was such a man, ascending to mid-tier First-Class Sovereign through sheer insight. A’cai shared this gift, earning both Guan Yu’s and Second to Wolf’s confidence. Ordinarily, securing such a disciple would be a joy. Yet Second to Wolf’s reluctance perplexed Guan Yu. Still, he harbored no doubts—Second to Wolf meant no harm to either of them. His refusal likely stemmed from personal burdens.

After the meal, Guan Yu wandered the courtyard, admiring the flora. The previous owner must have cherished plants deeply, perhaps valuing them as life itself.

The sprawling courtyard centered on a large flowerbed bursting with blooms arranged in a gradient—deep hues near the main residence fading to softer tones outward, all meticulously tended.

To the left stood greenery: saplings encircling a towering, unfamiliar tree. Its majestic presence resembled a leader flanked by followers.

To the right lay a lawn with a pebble path leading to a pavilion. The courtyard’s elegance spoke of a fastidious former owner.

As Guan Yu strolled, he envied Western regions where spacious yards allowed personalized landscapes. Here, verdant vistas and pristine air fostered tranquility—a stark contrast to cramped, profit-driven land use in China.

Footsteps approached. Turning, Guan Yu saw Second to Wolf—a man of few words—unexpectedly seeking him out.

“Need something?” Guan Yu asked.

“Yes,” Second to Wolf replied bluntly, seating himself on a wooden bench. “I should’ve spoken sooner, but the timing wasn’t right.”

“What troubles you?” Guan Yu’s curiosity piqued. Rarely did Second to Wolf seek aid—he could resolve most issues alone.

“You know I have a sister, yes? Even amnesiac, you must’ve heard of her.”

Guan Yu vaguely recalled mentions from others: a girl in Japan, sister to Second to Wolf, who’d sent him to aid Guan Yu.

“Apologies—my memory is faint. I gather she’s a dear friend who enlisted your help?”

Second to Wolf’s assistance, invaluable and unconditional, stemmed from his sister’s plea. His sole remaining kin—a nineteen-year-old sister—held his utmost devotion.

Nineteen years prior, Second to Wolf’s aging mother died in childbirth, leaving his father to raise the girl. Overwhelmed by grief, the father soon perished, forcing Second to Wolf to raise her.

This sister, Jinci Yingzi, became his raison d’être. Years ago, she and Guan Yu had swiftly become lovers. After Guan Yu vanished, she languished in longing, pleading to search for him.

Second to Wolf, enraged by Guan Yu’s abandonment, sought to kill him in China. Yet upon discovering Guan Yu’s amnesia, he observed him—confirming his integrity—and stayed his hand.

Yingzi, undeterred by Guan Yu’s forgotten past and multiple wives, yearned to reunite. Second to Wolf, unable to refuse her, now faced her imminent arrival.

“My sister isn’t merely your friend,” Second to Wolf declared, fists clenched. “She’s your woman.”

Guan Yu absorbed this revelation—a forgotten romance resurfacing.

“Before your amnesia, you met her in Japan—Jinci Yingzi. After your liaison, you left. She awaited you, only to learn of your accident. Despite your new life, her devotion never wavered. I can no longer stop her from coming.”

Second to Wolf’s voice hardened. “I demand you marry her. Not merely accept her—wed her properly.”

The words struck Guan Yu like thunder. Marriage? His mind reeled. Among his many lovers, none had demanded this.

Second to Wolf understood the audacity. Yet Guan Yu’s women stayed willingly, drawn not by wealth or power but his character—his integrity, wit, and kindness.

Guan Yu steadied himself. “Yingzi may come. But marriage… You know my situation. How could I choose one without upheaval?”

Second to Wolf stood abruptly, anger flaring. “You refuse her?”

Guan Yu tugged his sleeve. “Hear me out. If I marry Yingzi, what of the others? Could we truly find happiness amid their wrath?”

**Chapter 2313: No Impression**

Guan Yu’s mind churned. Marrying Yingzi risked turmoil. Yet how to atone for this forgotten debt?

**Chapter 2314: Charisma**

Second to Wolf frowned. Guan Yu’s charm eluded him—a man surrounded by women loyal beyond reason. Was it his heart, his unwavering principles, or fate’s whims?

Guan Yu sighed. “This requires careful consideration. My circumstances bind me.”

Second to Wolf relented, grudgingly acknowledging the complexity. For now, Yingzi’s arrival loomed—a storm threatening to unravel Guan Yu’s tangled bonds.
