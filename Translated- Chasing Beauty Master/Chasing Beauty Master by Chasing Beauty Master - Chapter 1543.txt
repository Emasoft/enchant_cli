“That impressive? He went straight to her home?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Seems my brother’s truly fallen hard this time.”

Xiao Zhi’s already swollen face turned even redder. He glanced helplessly at Guan Yu, at a loss for words.

Wang Jun added, “If you hadn’t dragged yourself out of bed earlier, Xiao Zhi would’ve already gone to find her. Honestly, I’d do the same. There’s no shame in comforting someone during their grief—it’s only human.”

Guan Yu patted Xiao Zhi’s shoulder. “Don’t fret. After breakfast, I’ll accompany you.”

“Then I’m coming too!” Wang Jiun interjected. “I was going to spare Xiao Zhi the embarrassment of being a third wheel, but since you’re tagging along, might as well make it a group outing. Better than sitting idle.”

“Weren’t you just whining about needing sleep?” Guan Yu teased. “Or was that all an act?”

“I’m wide awake now,” Wang Jun retorted. “Besides, we should resolve Du Bingyan’s situation quickly. Prince Zou invited us to the City Lord’s Manor tonight.”

**Chapter 4001: Filling the Belly**

“Then let’s not delay,” Guan Yu said. “We’ll investigate immediately.”

The trio arrived at the clinic, only to find Du Bingyan and her parents gone.

“Physician, where are the patients from this room?” Xiao Zhi urgently asked.

The physician eyed them warily. The patients had succumbed to delayed treatment, and with Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun’s altered appearances, he didn’t recognize them. “Who are you?” he countered, noting their formidable bearing.

Guan Yu smiled disarmingly. “We’re relatives. Came to pay our respects upon hearing the grave news.”

“They passed moments ago,” the physician replied. “Their daughter took the bodies.”

Xiao Zhi blanched. “But they were supposed to last till sunset! Where did she take them?”

“I’ve no idea. Never visited their home.”

Defeated, the trio exited. Xiao Zhi kicked at the dirt. “We’re too late. Finding her in this sprawling city now...”

Guan Yu squeezed his shoulder. “She’s likely arranging funeral rites. With the silver you gave, she’ll manage. Fate will reunite you.”

As stomachs growled, Wang Jun pointed across the street. “Look! Those street performers from last night!”

Xiao Zhi ignored the distraction, zeroing in on a noodle shop. “Let’s eat.”

**Chapter 4002: Schemes**

The shop’s sparse breakfast crowd included two rough-looking men with straight-bladed swords. Guan Yu noted their hushed conversation about a “target remaining at the City Lord’s Manor until tomorrow.”

His eyes narrowed. *Assassins targeting Prince Zou?*

After tailing the men briefly, Guan Yu shrugged. “Let the Prince’s guards handle it. We’ll intervene only if necessary.”

As they navigated bustling streets toward the manor, Wang Jun complained, “At this pace, we’ll never reach the desert mission before the seventh-month deadline!”

“The Emperor wants threats to surface during this slow procession,” Guan Yu explained. “Prince Zou knows he’s bait, but what choice has he? Disobedience risks his household.”

“Ruthless,” Xiao Zhi muttered. “I’d disappear rather than be sacrificial pawn.”

“And condemn your kin?” Guan Yu countered. “Imperial power brooks no defiance. The strong devour the weak—this truth spans millennia.”

**Chapter 4003: Profound Gratitude**

At the weathered City Lord’s Manor, guards ushered them directly to the main hall where Prince Zou played chess with the City Lord.

“Excellent timing!” The Prince beamed. “Tonight’s feast shall—”

Guan Yu’s attention snagged on four discreet swordsmen flanking the room. Their blades matched those from the noodle shop. He leaned toward Wang Jun. “Stay alert. The game begins tonight.”

As courtesies were exchanged, Guan Yu’s hand drifted to his own sword hilt. The real banquet, he knew, would be served in blood before dawn.
