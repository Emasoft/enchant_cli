Elder Qing nodded and said, “Indeed. Don’t you even know this? I truly don’t understand how you’ve interacted with Guanyu. You remain unaware of such significant matters.”

Siqi lowered her head in silence, inwardly vexed that Elder Qing kept steering the conversation toward *that* topic. She had never been involved with any man before, and his words made her blush with embarrassment.

Elder Qing chuckled. “Look at that expression! Are you flustered? You accepted such an important gift from him—surely you understand what it implies? Ordinary people don’t casually bestow high-grade magical artifacts. Have you not considered this?”

Siqi continued staring at the ground, saying nothing. Finding her lack of response dull, Elder Qing ceased teasing and remarked, “If Guanyu ever breaks his seals and masters both demonic and orthodox cultivation, he’ll become a formidable power. Such a man would become a pillar of Cloud Azure Sect. That boy is no ordinary pond fish.”

“The snake soup is ready. Take it to Guanyu. Since his limbs are still immobile, you’ll need to feed him.” Elder Qing gestured to the iron pot.

Siqi’s cheeks flushed again. Feeding Guanyu? Must all these mortifying tasks fall to her? Noticing her hesitation, Elder Qing sighed, “What? Shall I feed him instead?”

“N-no! Please don’t misunderstand, Elder Qing. I’ll go at once!” Startled, Siqi scrambled up, grabbed the steaming broth, and hurried out. The sight of serpent flesh in the bowl made her skin crawl.

Returning to the room, she found Guanyu still asleep. *Let him rest longer,* she thought. *The soup is too hot anyway—it can cool awhile.*

In truth, Guanyu wasn’t sleeping. He was mediating the turbulent energies within his body. His cultivated inner qi pressed down upon the rebellious spiritual power inherited from the Merit Cauldron, the two forces yet to reach equilibrium.

Like a diplomat appeasing rival factions, Guanyu carefully soothed both energies. Another violent clash could destroy him. While his inner qi obeyed his control, the foreign spiritual power remained unruly, demanding meticulous coaxing.

Sensing movement nearby, Guanyu opened his eyes to find Siqi massaging his arms to stimulate meridians. “Something smells delicious,” he remarked, nose twitching at the rich aroma.

“You’re awake!” Siqi brightened. “Elder Qing prepared snake soup. You must be starving—here, drink.” She lifted the bowl. Though Guanyu’s limbs tingled with returning sensation, weakness pinned him to the bed, forcing him to accept her aid.

“Snake soup? Why such an odd remedy? Is it safe?” Guanyu eyed the broth warily. Though resistant to toxins, he knew many serpents carried deadly venoms. Even he couldn’t recklessly gamble with his life.

“Elder Qing said it’s highly nourishing for your recovery. If he meant harm, he’d choose simpler methods.” Her logic rang true. After three days with only water, Guanyu’s hunger overrode caution.

Alone with him now, Siqi relaxed slightly. Perched on the bedside, she spooned broth into his mouth with less embarrassment than before.

“Aren’t you afraid of snakes? Could you eat this?” she whispered.

Though conscious, Guanyu remained wan and frail—his internal injuries required prolonged convalescence. “I’ve seen enough snakes to fear none,” he said, recalling the colossal twenty-meter python from tropical forests. “Once encountered a serpent longer than six houses.”

“Twenty meters? Heaven’s mercy!” Siqi shuddered. “The largest I’ve seen was two meters. It froze me with terror—I feared it would strike.”

Guanyu chuckled weakly. “A cultivator fearing mere snakes? Unless it’s demonic, why panic? If a two-meter snake petrifies you, a twenty-meter python would leave you comatose.”

“Hmph! Fortunately, I’ve never seen such monsters and never wish to!” Siqi retorted playfully, stuffing a morsel of snake meat into his mouth.

Guanyu chewed appreciatively. “Elder Qing’s culinary skills surprise me. This is quite savory. Have you eaten?”

Siqi shook her head vigorously. “I couldn’t! Snakes terrify me—eating their flesh? Unthinkable.”

Guanyu smiled but said no more. His immediate concern was Wolf Second’s reaction. Though Xiao Zhi and A’Ze would inform his friend of the situation, Wolf Second wouldn’t rest without seeing him personally.

As anticipated, Wolf Second stormed into Xuanming’s hall. The Six Peaks Assembly had concluded days prior, with all peak masters returning to their domains. “Three days gone, still no Guanyu! What trickery is this? Where is he?”

Xuanming maintained composure. “As I said, minor complications arose during the Merit Cauldron’s inheritance. He recuperates in the rear mountains under Elder Qing and Siqi’s care. Patience, Brother Jinci.”

“Patience? Three days ago you said ‘a few days’! Take me to him now!” Wolf Second demanded, temper fraying.

“The rear mountains are forbidden to outsiders. Please, await his return.” Xuanming spread his hands placatingly.

“Forbidden? What treasures hide there? I seek no secrets—only to confirm his safety!”

“You have my word—”

“Your word won’t suffice! Either fetch him or let me see him!”

As tensions escalated, Siqi entered, breathless from her descent. Wolf Second whirled. “You! Where’s Guanyu?”

Calming herself, Siqi bowed to Xuanming first. “Guanyu sent me. He fears you’ll cause trouble and asks you to wait peacefully. He’ll return in three days.”

Wolf Second scrutinized her. “Swear he’s unharmed.”

“Merely minor injuries from the inheritance process. Elder Qing attends him personally. No danger remains.”

Reluctantly, Wolf Second acquiesced. “Three more days. If he fails to appear, I’ll tear through your precious forbidden grounds!”

**Chapter 3,335: The Gourd of Wine**

Xuanming sighed as Wolf Second departed. “Guanyu anticipated this turmoil.”

“He did,” Siqi confirmed. “He worried Wolf Second might force confrontation.”

“Wise lad. Only he can temper that wolf’s fury.”

Hungry from days of avoiding snake meat, Siqi sought provisions before returning. Elder Qing’s remedy, while efficacious for Guanyu, repelled her to the core.

For three days, serpent stew sustained Guanyu’s recovery. By the fourth dawn, he could walk unaided—a rebirth earned through Elder Qing’s potent brews and Siqi’s tireless care. Before departing, Guanyu paid respects to the eccentric elder.

“You’ve mended,” Elder Qing intoned without opening his eyes. “No qi manipulation yet. Begone, and trouble me no more.”

Guanyu bowed deeply. “Gratitude for your care, Elder Qing. We take our leave.”

At Tiger Head Peak’s rear gate, Wolf Second waited, wine gourd in hand. Today marked the deadline. Spotting figures descending the mountain path, he squinted—then grinned. Though pale, Guanyu moved steadily, supported by Siqi. Satisfied, Wolf Second turned away, swigging from his gourd.

Guanyu noted his friend’s discreet departure with approval. Leaning into Siqi’s fragrant embrace throughout the journey had been... agreeable. He’d miss her attentiveness.

Reporting to Xuanming, Guanyu expressed thanks while Siqi prepared to depart. “Wait!” Guanyu interjected. “I still need assistance. Who’ll care for me if you leave?”

Xuanming nodded permission. As Siqi hesitated, Guanyu added plaintively, “Abandoning your patient so soon?”

Resigned yet amused, Siqi stayed.
