Jiang Yuankai sighed and nodded, saying, “I understand. Rest assured, I won’t act recklessly.”

Guanyu felt relieved. At least Jiang Yuankai, faced with such circumstances, was willing to heed advice. This gave Guanyu considerable peace of mind.

“Brother Jiang, the reason I’ve come to you so late is to discuss something,” Guanyu continued. “Have you noticed how our travel routes and whereabouts have become common knowledge among so many in the martial world? This defies all logic.”

“Brother Wan, you’re suggesting there’s a traitor among us, aren’t you?” Jiang Yuankai stated bluntly. “Truthfully, I’d already considered this possibility before you mentioned it.”

“I first suspected something during our stay at that inn in the town,” Jiang Yuankai said. “Moreover, I’m certain this traitor must be among my closest subordinates.”

“So Brother Jiang had already sensed the anomaly,” Guanyu remarked. “It took me days of piecing things together to reach the same conclusion. Your experience truly shines through. This spy’s purpose was to subtly lead you into their trap.”

Jiang Yuankai explained, “Last time in that town, the Prairie Eleven Brothers laid their ambush with precise timing and preparation. Someone must have relayed our exact route beforehand—otherwise, those newly arrived Prairie Eleven Brothers couldn’t have tracked us so swiftly. I’ve been searching for this traitor myself.”

“Since Brother Jiang already discovered this, my concerns seem trivial,” Guanyu said. “Have you identified the spy thus far?”

Jiang Yuankai shook his head. “You know I sent a letter home to the Grand Princess in the capital through a messenger. That person is my prime suspect. We’ll see what developments occur from that.”

“The messenger I sent is called Xiao Jiu. I suspect he’s been bribed long ago,” Jiang Yuankai revealed.

Guanyu looked puzzled. “Brother Jiang, if you already doubted him, why entrust him with the letter? Aren’t you afraid he might divert it en route?”

**Chapter 5103: Unwilling to Relinquish**

“That shouldn’t happen,” Jiang Yuankai asserted. “I deliberately sent him. The letter to the Grand Princess contains specially crafted wording I hope she’ll decipher. Moreover, I added a final instruction to detain the messenger. Thus, after delivering the letter, Xiao Jiu won’t find returning easy. The letter also explicitly warns my family to monitor him closely.”

Guanyu nodded, impressed that Jiang Yuankai had discreetly dispatched the suspect. However, he now wondered whether Xiao Jiu truly was the traitor, given Jiang Yuankai’s uncertainty.

“Brother Jiang, when did you first suspect him?” Guanyu inquired.

“Immediately after the Prairie Eleven Brothers’ appearance,” Jiang Yuankai sighed. “I found it strange—they hadn’t operated in the Central Plains for years, yet suddenly ambushed us with meticulous preparation. Clearly, they’d received intelligence.”

“Through covert observation and process of elimination, Xiao Jiu emerged as suspicious. Being the newest member of my retinue and a gambling addict, he’d be easily bribed with silver for his habit.”

The old ginger proved sharper indeed—Jiang Yuankai had quietly disposed of the spy without alerting others.

“During our military camp stay,” Jiang Yuankai continued, “I questioned each subordinate. Xiao Jiu proved most dubious. Xiao Wu reported him disappearing entire days, returning reeking of alcohol with bulging coin pouches. My suspicions solidified when, during my convalescence from monster wounds, I caught him rummaging through my tent.”

“Initially, I planned immediate execution but delayed to avoid alarming others. Upon arriving here, I realized the situation’s gravity. The martial world’s commotion reached even my sickbed. Now I understand—Xiao Jiu wasn’t merely bribed. He covets my East Sea Dragon Pearl, hence leaking our route to force us into vulnerability.”

“Assuming you were unaware of the spy, I planned silent elimination to avoid embarrassment. Fearing public scandal, I devised this method, hoping the Grand Princess would apprehend him in the capital.”

Guanyu admired Jiang Yuankai’s shrewdness—neutralizing the spy quietly, albeit belatedly. Without Jiang Yuankai’s preemptive move, Guanyu might never have identified the traitor.

“Since you’ve identified the spy, your approach is sound,” Guanyu acknowledged. “The external situation worsens—through inquiries, I learned outsiders consider the Duan family as East Sea descendants who know its location. All follow our trail.”

“This must be Xiao Jiu’s doing—that cur deliberately sowed trouble!” Jiang Yuankai coughed angrily.

“Don’t distress yourself further, Brother Jiang. With Xiao Jiu gone, we must devise new strategies.”

Guanyu sat down. “You might not know—Xiao Rong possesses true face-changing arts, beyond mere cosmetics. Perhaps we should disguise ourselves before proceeding, eluding pursuers.”

“An excellent plan. We’ll trouble Miss Xiao Rong then,” Jiang Yuankai agreed.

Guanyu hesitated before advising, “Brother Jiang, considering your health, perhaps... I’ve learned major cultivation sects advance on the East Sea en masse. Even the Demon Soul Sect’s Patriarch mobilizes personally for the treasure. What chances do we have against such forces?”

“What? The Patriarch himself?” Jiang Yuankai started.

Guanyu confirmed, “Not just him—Red Lotus Sect’s Sun Lianzi and Cloud Azure Sect’s Xuanming will likely come. A bloody conflict brews. Worse, demonic beings infiltrate the ranks—the demonic realm won’t stay idle.”

“Such chaos! The East Sea shall become a mass grave. Whether the treasure exists matters little—with these factions involved, our chances vanish.”

As Jiang Yuankai spoke, Guanyu felt secret relief. If danger prompted retreat, relinquishing the East Sea Dragon Pearl would ensure Jiang Yuankai’s safety. Let others fight over the treasure—he could return to the capital, accompany the Grand Princess and Jiang Xin, living peacefully despite lost cultivation.

But Jiang Yuankai declared, “Yet I won’t abandon this quest. Such treasures favor the destined, not merely the powerful. Having come this far, I refuse to quit halfway. Returning now would shame me through whatever years I might live.”

**Chapter 5104: Shifting Circumstances**

Guanyu’s hopes proved futile—Jiang Yuankai’s resolve remained unshaken. Respecting this, Guanyu acquiesced, though Jiang Yuankai made valid points: mighty forces didn’t guarantee success, and destiny played its role.

Inevitable conflict loomed. Duan Ruxue might remain safe at their destination if avoiding confrontation, being functionally expendable. But Jiang Yuankai, holding the East Sea Dragon Pearl, would become the prime target. Guanyu resolved to persuade him then to relinquish the artifact—a burning coal in anyone’s grasp, inviting collective assault.

Meanwhile, the Right Envoy tracked the minotaur creature Qiqi discovered, finding beastmen mingling with martial artists. Judging the situation unfavorable for confrontation, he withdrew.

At a relatively luxurious tavern in Twin Cities—newly established Demon Soul Sect base—the Right Envoy met the Patriarch in an upper chamber.

“Lord Patriarch, demons mingle with martial artists targeting the East Sea treasure. I was followed—accidentally discovering demonic presence,” he reported.

The Patriarch, dark hair cascading smoothly, toyed with a jade lion figurine. “So martial artists fall under demonic control?”

“Essentially, though details require verification. Demons clearly know about the Dragon Pearl’s resurgence.”

“Then our enemies multiply,” the Patriarch smirked coldly. “Let the orthodox sects clash with demons first. We’ll reap the spoils—an ideal scenario.”

“Your wisdom illuminates,” the Right Envoy said. “Demonic numbers remain unknown—reckless engagement unwise. They possess cunning matching ours.”

“Assign Three-Heads to investigate,” the Patriarch commanded. “His expertise suits discerning demons. Allocate him personnel.”

Three-Heads—formerly the wolf-demon physician—had served since stealing the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Lotus from Red Lotus Sect. Awaiting opportunities to rescue their Six-Headed Wolf King leader, the wolf-demons knew the melting Ice Lotus would soon free their kin entombed in glacial prisons.

The Right Envoy continued, “I visited Young Mistress—she remains with Guanyu, well cared for. Despite urging her return due to East Sea’s dangers... you know her temperament.”

“That foolish girl!” The Patriarch slammed the jade lion down. “Enchanted by that Guanyu wretch—sticking to him like glue! This expedition’s perils multiply with demonic involvement. She mustn’t go! If persuasion fails, bind her!”

“Forgive me, Lord—I cannot overpower Guanyu alone. Only your presence could achieve this.”

The Patriarch snorted. “Very well—I’ll retrieve her myself! Can’t have my daughter throwing her life away!”

**Chapter 5105: Waterlogged Brains**

Only the Patriarch could compel Wang Xiaorong’s obedience. The Right Envoy then presented the Soul-Siphoning Whip’s missing half—the Spirit-Devouring Whip.

“You obtained the Spirit-Devouring Whip? How?” The Patriarch examined it keenly.

“Guanyu gifted it—claimed it came from Xuanming.”

“What?” The Patriarch’s face darkened. “That brat gave you this? What price did he demand?”

“None. He simply handed it over.”

“You’re not compromised?” The Patriarch glared. “Such a treasure—given freely?”

“No conditions, Lord. I report only truth.”

The Patriarch studied his subordinate, suspicion and calculation warring in his eyes as the jade lion cracked under his tightening grip.
