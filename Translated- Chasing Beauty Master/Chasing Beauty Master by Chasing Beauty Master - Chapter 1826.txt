He now believed Wan Hong was sent by the Eldest Princess. Even with Chu Fan's wealth, competing with royal finances would be suicidal. If this Wan Hong didn't withdraw, Chu Fan would certainly lose today's estate bid. Thus, anxiety colored his demeanor.

***

"Impossible! Mother already promised she'd stop targeting you. Why would she send troublemakers again? How utterly vexing!" Lady Jiang stamped her foot.

***

During a previous incident, the Eldest Princess had dispatched disruptors to Crimson Charm Theater. Upon discovering this, Lady Jiang staged such hysterics upon returning home – weeping, raging, and threatening self-harm – that she terrified the Eldest Princess into submission. The entire Imperial Son-in-Law's residence had been thrown into chaos.

***

But Lady Jiang wasn't finished. She lodged a formal complaint with the Emperor against the Eldest Princess, leaving the latter no choice but to promise never to interfere with Chu Fan again – though she still refused to endorse their relationship.

***

Despite surface-level compliance, the Eldest Princess continued creating covert difficulties for Chu Fan.

***

In the capital, while high-ranking officials held obvious prestige, four great families dominated societal discourse – collectively known as the Four Great Clans.

***

These clans wielded formidable influence: the Duan, Qin, Tang, and Cao Families. The Qin Family currently reigned supreme, having gained imperial favor years earlier when the family patriarch's youngest sister caught Second Prince's eye and entered his household.

***

This occurred during Second Prince's zenith of political power. Through his patronage, the Qin Family accumulated wealth and status, their influence snowballing.

***

Presently, the other three clans paled in comparison to the Qin's dominance. With Second Prince's backing, the Qin could make the capital tremble at their steps – none dared cross them.

***

Yet the remaining three clans remained formidable in their own right. The Tang Family's patriarch shared childhood ties with the Emperor. Though now retired from worldly affairs...

***

...the family still controlled major commercial enterprises. Younger generations managed daily operations, but in true crises, the Tangs retained direct access to imperial ears. Furthermore, their patriarch's imperial-bestowed Yellow Jacket granted immunity from ordinary prosecution.

***

In recent years, Qin's expansion under Second Prince's wing solidified their position as foremost among the Four Great Clans.

***

The Duan Family dominated the capital's goldsmith trade. From high-end jewelry shops supplying palace consorts to crafting royal ornaments, their master artisans' skills surpassed even imperial craftsmen. When the Empress once sought to recruit Duan artisans into palace service, they refused – loyalty bound them solely to the Duan household.

***

Nearly all exquisite jewelry and precious ornaments in the capital bore the Duan hallmark, cementing their prestige.

***

The Cao Family's power stemmed from strategic marriages. Patriarch Cao, now in his sixties, sired seven daughters and one son. In youth, he'd been handsome merchant of modest means who married a great beauty.

***

As his "Seven Fairy" daughters matured into renowned beauties, Cao strategically wedded them to powerful officials. Though failing to connect with Second Prince's household during the prince's youth, these alliances gradually elevated Cao into the capital's elite circles.

***

Despite seven daughters, Cao desperately desired a son. At fifty, he took a young concubine who finally bore him a son – the now-notorious Cao Di, who ran amok in the capital under protection from his sister (wife of the Capital Prefect).

***

Among the Four Clans' younger generation, each boasted prominent scions:

Qin Huan, eldest son of the Qin Family, ruled capital streets through fear, shielded by his clan's paramount status.

***

Tang Muchen of the Tang Family achieved fame as the capital's literary prodigy. Fresh into adulthood, he topped imperial examinations, earning direct praise from the Emperor and future ministerial prospects – bringing reflected glory to his clan.

***

The Duan Family's situation differed. Apart from peerless beauty Duan Ruxue (Snow-like), they only had a five-year-old male heir born late in the patriarch's life.

***

Duan Ruxue's celestial beauty rivaled Lady Jiang's. Together, they were hailed as the capital's Twin Phoenixes – dual jewels of their generation.

***

Chapter 4779: A Sure Bet

***

By conventional standards, Lady Jiang's status surpassed Duan Ruxue's. The Jiangs' extraordinary position stemmed from Jiang Yuankai's martial world influence, the Eldest Princess' palace authority, and Jiang Xin's imperial favor as honorary Commandery Princess.

***

Thus Duan Ruxue stood slightly lower in hierarchy. Were men to choose between them, most would select Lady Jiang – in this dog-eat-dog world, her status shone brighter.

***

Though Jiang's Imperial Son-in-Law saw diminished influence recently, a starved camel still outweighs a horse. With the Eldest Princess managing household affairs and Lady Jiang's royal blood, society classified the Jiangs as quasi-imperial rather than part of the Four Clans.

***

Current elite gossip revolved around Jiang Xin and Duan Ruxue. Young masters endlessly speculated about these unapproachable beauties who moved only in rarefied circles alongside Qin Huan, Tang Muchen, and Cao Di.

***

Lady Jiang's recent public appearances increased due to frequent visits to Chu Fan, making her more visible. Conversely, the reclusive Duan Ruxue remained elusive, prompting young nobles to scheme for excuses to visit Duan residences.

***

The capital's vastness ensured palace affairs stayed separate from street rumors. Newcomer Guan Yu (Wan Hong) sought to establish reputation here – crucial in this status-obsessed city.

***

Today's bid for Crimson Charm Theater wasn't targeted against Chu Fan, but coincidence. Though Chu Fan misunderstood, Guan Yu remained undeterred.

***

Convinced of Guan Yu being the Eldest Princess' pawn, Chu Fan watched Lady Jiang approach the newcomer. All eyes followed her – the courtyard's radiant sun.

***

"Wan Hong," Lady Jiang demanded, "speak truthfully – are you Mother's agent?" Guan Yu admired her bluntness.

***

The crowd murmured understanding. This explained the lavish East Sea Dragon Pearl gift and current bidding war against Chu Fan. If acting for the Eldest Princess, everything aligned – displaying royal wealth through the pearl while blocking Chu Fan's theater acquisition.

***

Guan Yu shook his head. "You mistake me, Lady Jiang. I'm but a newcomer drawn to that property. Money means little when I desire something."

***

Chu Fan scoffed nearby. Only fools believed such lies. Of course a covert agent would deny his mission!

***

"Can you swear to this?" Lady Jiang pressed.

***

Guan Yu's smile widened at her naivety. "Why would I deceive you?"

***

"Then why gift me priceless dragon pearls?"

***

"Treasures suit beauties. That pearl's magnificence matched only by yours. Besides," he added smoothly, "I wanted that black gemstone."

***

Flattery any maiden would swoon over visibly pleased Lady Jiang.

***

Chapter 4780: Revelations

***

Lady Jiang glanced helplessly at Chu Fan, who snapped: "Only royal lackeys shower strangers with treasures! Admit your role!"

***

Guan Yu upped the bid to 50,000 taels. Chu Fan countered: "55,000!"

***

The auctioneer glowed. "Master Wan Hong continues astonishing us! 60,000 taels!"

***

"I do enjoy surprising people," Guan Yu smiled.

***

Lady Jiang stepped closer, tilting her head. "No sane buyer would pay triple value. You're clearly harassing Chu Fan!"

***

"Again, you err," Guan Yu replied. "I lack local price knowledge but possess endless silver. What I want, I get."

***

None believed him. The crowd buzzed about royal interference. Guan Yu shrugged – explanations wasted breath. This theater would be his.
