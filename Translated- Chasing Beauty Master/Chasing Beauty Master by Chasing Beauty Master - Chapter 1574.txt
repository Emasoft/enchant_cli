“This item is still a very novel thing at present,” Guan Yu said. “Therefore, I think it’s best not to reveal it except in critical moments. Only when used to save one’s life at crucial junctures will it fulfill its intended purpose.”

Wang Jun nodded in agreement. “Exactly. The replicability of this item here is too high. Perhaps within a few years, hand crossbows will become commonplace. But for now, it’s the best self-defense weapon. It’s not that we shouldn’t use it—rather, we should reserve it for critical moments. As a hidden weapon, I believe it will prove far more effective.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded in understanding. “Don’t worry. Though I adore it, I won’t casually reveal it in daily life. As you both said, this crossbow’s sole purpose is life preservation, not ostentation.”

“It’s good you understand,” Guan Yu said with a smile. “Wang Jun, retrieve the crossbow bolt from the doorframe. Let’s eat first before discussing further.”

Wang Jun remarked, “Your hand crossbow is indeed exceptional, but unfortunately, its production cost is prohibitively high. Moreover, it’s irreplicable due to material shortages.”

“It’s not as dire as you suggest,” Guan Yu countered. “Even if the solid mercury is depleted, we could substitute silver or gold in proportional weights. Failing that, we could manufacture slightly lighter crossbow bolts. There are solutions.”

“Then you must make bolts for me later, Guan Yu,” Wang Xiaorong interjected. “I’ve no skill in crafting them.”

Wang Jun chuckled. “Hah! By gifting those bolts, you’ve doomed yourself to lifelong service.”

“That’s no trouble,” Guan Yu replied. “Truthfully, these bolts won’t be exhausted quickly. There are plenty here, and they suffer minimal wear if retrieved properly. Let’s eat and rest now.”

Wang Jun inquired, “Guan Yu, you seem transformed since your return. How did the Young Master alter his appearance so flawlessly? Not a trace remains detectable.”

“At Lupiu Town, I encountered a friend skilled in disguise techniques at our outpost. I learned from him, hence my improvement. Xiaorong’s current visage is also my handiwork. What do you think?”

After hearing this, Wang Jun nodded. “Truly remarkable. Completely unrecognizable—it’s as if her entire being has transformed.”

“You say that,” Wang Xiaorong complained, “but wearing this mask feels utterly uncomfortable and unnatural. I’d never endure it without Guan Yu’s insistence.”

“Necessity demands disguise for our safety,” Guan Yu stated firmly.

At noon, Guan Yu slept briefly before rising, feeling no particular fatigue. Wang Xiaorong, however, slept soundly until their departure time approached. Lord Zou’s convoy prepared to leave, aiming to reach Inscription City before nightfall.

Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu revisited the horse trader’s establishment. The beaming proprietor greeted him: “Your return honors us, sir.”

“I need another horse. Any noteworthy recommendations?” Guan Yu inquired pleasantly.

“Our selection is unparalleled—every variety available,” the trader boasted, leading him to the rear stables.

Guan Yu asked, “How fares the groom who fell earlier? No lasting harm, I hope?”

“Truthfully, that was my brother-in-law. Two broken ribs. At his age, recovery won’t be swift.” The trader sighed. The incident had cost him dearly—the red mare sold to Guan Yu brought virtually no profit.

Inspecting the stables, Guan Yu selected a white steed. When queried about price, the trader hesitated: “What value would you place on this mount? Name your consideration.”

Chapter 4082: The White Steed

Guan Yu found the reversed inquiry peculiar. The trader, recognizing his expertise, feared overpricing might deter the sale. “This coat is exceptional—clearly a fresh mount,” Guan Yu observed, noting its untrained status.

“You’ve a keen eye, sir!” the trader admitted. “Newly arrived from the grasslands, purebred in every respect. For a loyal patron—fifty taels.”

“Done,” Guan Yu agreed promptly, pressed for time. The white mare, snow-bodied with black-hoof accents, was destined for Wang Xiaorong. Though worth forty taels by his estimate, haggling seemed imprudent.

The startled trader, expecting negotiations, offered: “Such promptness deserves reward—a free saddle! Return or recommend friends, and further discounts await.”

Guan Yu thanked him, leading the mare back to find forty-odd mercenaries assembled—a motley guard for Lord Zou’s caravan. Their eclectic appearance suited Guan Yu’s purposes; combat readiness mattered more than uniformity.

Anticipating ambushes from Imperial Guards and rival factions, Guan Yu remained vigilant. Wang Xiaorong’s delight upon seeing the white mare proved infectious. “This must be mine! So pristine—how splendid!”

“Call her ‘Snow’ if you wish,” Guan Yu smiled. “Red can’t bear two riders indefinitely.”

Amidst the caravan, their crimson and ivory steeds stood conspicuous. As Lord Zou entered his carriage, Zou Wuxiao commanded departure.

Beyond Haler City’s gates, the convoy hastened—vanguard led by Second Captain, rearguard including Guan Yu’s group. Wang Xiaorong radiated joy, content through perils and comforts alike with Guan Yu nearby.

Wang Jun reported: “Scouts say mountainous terrain lies ahead. Two ranges to cross before Inscription City.”

“Stay alert in the mountains,” Guan Yu warned. “Ambushes are certain.”

Approaching foothills where trade routes wound circuitously, Guan Yu noted sparse vegetation offering little cover. “Taking the mountain pass saves time,” he advised Lord Zou, who approved the shortcut.

The rocky ascent proved manageable, though horses bore the strain. Tension erupted when two mercenaries quarreled over position-jostling, halting the procession.

“Settle this elsewhere!” Guan Yu interjected coldly. “Fight properly—winner stays, loser forfeits their deposit and leaves.”

Lord Zou attempted conciliation: “We’re hired for protection, not squabbles. Apologies suffice.”

Guan Yu remained firm: “This caravan needs no troublemakers. Prove your worth through combat or depart.”

The bald, aging provocateur challenged his opponent to open ground. Guan Yu declared: “Let this precedent stand—disputes here are settled by strength. Might determines right.”

Spectators encircled the combatants as the bald man attacked with surprising speed, his younger adversary momentarily frozen.

“Why does he hesitate?” Wang Xiaorong fretted as Guan Yu assessed the fighters—the elder barely a third-tier martial artist by Central Plains standards, mediocre even in this realm where spiritual cultivation dominated.

Yet in this qi-rich world favoring immortal practitioners, such martial artists persisted, often partnered with spellcasters in organizations like the Imperial Guards. Battlefields rarely saw immortals—their vulnerability requiring heavy protection made them impractical for warfare.
