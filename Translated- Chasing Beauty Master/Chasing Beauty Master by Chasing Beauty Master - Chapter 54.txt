“Ah, don’t mention it! That kid actually has connections with my uncle. Yesterday, the old man personally gave me special instructions... Never mind, let’s not talk about it!” Liu Jun fumed inwardly. What rotten luck! His own nephew hadn’t received much favor, yet the old man seemed to hold Guan Yu in such high regard—it looked like he was willing to invest heavily in supporting this upstart!

The mere thought made Liu Jun’s blood boil. After years of waiting in the shadows, barely making progress by exploiting his uncle’s reputation through shady dealings to scrape together some wealth—all while the old man turned a blind eye—here was Guan Yu, an outsider, being groomed like a son! Was the old fool senile? Had he forgotten his own nephew?

Though seething, Liu Jun dared not show it. Crossing the old man was unthinkable. Fine. Let Guan Yu have his temporary advantage. Before the kid rose too high, Liu Jun would cozy up to him. How hard could it be to manipulate a twenty-something rookie when he himself was a seasoned thirty-year-old?

Guan Yu and Luo Cheng stood before the grand racing car. “You brothers can head back. I’ll take a taxi.”

“Let me drive you?” Luo Cheng rubbed his hands, gratitude stuck in his throat. He’d thanked Guan Yu endlessly already—any more would feel hollow.

**Chapter 129: Mother Luo, Savior of Orphans**

Guan Yu shook his head, gesturing to the injured Flying Riders Gang member. “Get this brother medical care. He’s taken quite a beating. Let him rest. As for the money—no rush. Pay me back when you’re able.”

Though impressed by Luo Cheng’s principles, Guan Yu wasn’t foolish enough to give cash freely. Whether Luo Cheng would honor the debt remained to be seen, but forging this bond felt worthwhile.

“Don’t worry, Brother Guan. Once my family’s situation stabilizes, I’ll repay every cent!” Luo Cheng vowed. Despite leading a gang, his “Flying Riders” survived on petty dispute resolutions, avoiding dirty money. Their existence was threadbare—barely more than street urchins.

“Alright then. I’m off.” Guan Yu clapped the released gang member’s shoulder. “Don’t pull stunts like this again. Liu Jun’s loans may be predatory, but debts are debts. ‘Rob the rich to feed the poor’? That’s nonsense nowadays—”

“Wait, it’s not what you think!” The man protested. “We borrowed desperately to save Mother Luo! She’s hospitalized with uremia—”

“He’s right,” Luo Cheng cut in urgently. “Our brothers were raised by Mother Luo. When she needed a kidney transplant, we panicked. We’d never normally—”

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow, recalling how these “noble” gangsters had harassed Gao Wei by the Qinhuai River. Yet Luo Cheng’s raw desperation felt genuine. “Orphans, you say?”

“Most of us grew up under Mother Luo’s care,” Luo Cheng admitted bleakly. “Now her treatment costs... The loan was a last resort.”

A spark lit Guan Yu’s eyes. “Take me to her. Maybe surgery won’t be needed.”

**Chapter 130: Qigong Healing?**

At Second Hospital’s ward, Guan Yu met the frail woman whose calloused hands betrayed decades of hardship. Her adoptive sons hovered protectively, one glaring—Guan Yu had once kicked over his motorcycle.

“Mother Luo, I practice therapeutic qigong. May I try?” Guan Yu offered.

Snickers rippled through the room. A nurse snorted: “Uremia cured by hand-waving?”

Ignoring them, Guan Yu placed his palm below Mother Luo’s navel. Warmth surged from his copper-coin talisman, energy flowing relentlessly. Sweat beaded his brow—this wasn’t a simple wound. The talisman’s power drained alarmingly...

**Chapter 131: Stop the Superstition!**

“Enough charades!” A senior doctor barked as colleagues entered. “Clear this circus!”

But Guan Yu’s eyes remained shut, the energy transfer intensifying. Mother Luo gasped—color returning to her cheeks. Monitor alarms suddenly blared, nurses freezing mid-step.

The lead physician’s clipboard clattered to the floor. “Impossible... Her creatinine levels—they’re normalizing!”
