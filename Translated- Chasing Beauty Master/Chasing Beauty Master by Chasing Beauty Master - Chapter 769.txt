“Hahaha, brother, you’ve got quite the sense of humor, but you’re overthinking it. I’ve arranged things this way for safety. My apartment complex has two buildings—this one houses mostly female tenants, while the other is for male customers,” Pan Taisheng explained.

“What if a couple or a family wants to rent?” Qing Ling’er piped up playfully beside them.

Pan Taisheng glanced at her unintentionally and froze for a moment. Her exquisite face, adorned with mischievous dimples, was utterly peerless. He shook his head helplessly and patted Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Brother, your taste is impeccable. Every beauty around you is a rare gem. Truly impressive.”

Pan Taisheng gave Guan Yu a thumbs-up. Guan Yu merely smiled, choosing not to clarify the misunderstanding about their relationship.

“If it’s a couple or family, we show them the rooms and let them pick whichever they prefer.”

“This one will do.” Pan Taisheng stopped at the door of Room 1207, swiped a keycard, and the lock clicked open.

The trio entered a spacious suite, far larger than Pan Xiaoxia’s room, complete with a private bathroom, separate shower, and modern amenities. The living area boasted bronze-toned furnishings—a stately sofa, matching floors, and a large TV mounted on a wall draped in European-patterned wallpaper. While not as opulent as a presidential suite, it was undeniably elegant.

“Well? Satisfied? This is one of my best rooms.”

“It’s lovely, but such a nice place must be expensive,” Ling’er murmured, her joy tinged with worry. She tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Brother Guan, shouldn’t we look somewhere cheaper?”

Guan Yu had never planned to pay rent. Before he could respond, Pan Taisheng laughed. “Ling’er, no need for formalities! You’re Guan Yu’s friend—that makes you mine. Stay as long as you like. No charge.”

Ling’er blinked in disbelief. *Free lodging in such a place? Is this a trick?*

Reading her thoughts, Guan Yu reassured her, “Stay without worry. Pan and I go way back. He’ll take good care of you. I’d fret if you were elsewhere.”

Meeting his earnest gaze, Ling’er felt a surge of gratitude. No one had ever shown her such kindness. Her nose tingled, but she fought back tears, bowing deeply instead. A thousand unspoken thanks swirled in her heart.

“Rest now. It’s late, and I must go,” Guan Yu said.

After settling Ling’er, Guan Yu and Pan descended downstairs. “Something’s off between you two,” Pan remarked. “Aren’t you staying?”

“Brother Pan, you tease me. I met Ling’er just hours ago. She’d been assaulted by thugs—I intervened. With no safe place to go, I brought her here.”

“Heroics suit you! Maybe I’ll stroll around tomorrow, rescue a beauty myself!” Pan chuckled, slinging an arm over Guan Yu. “Dawn’s near. Stay. Let’s grab a drink.”

Though touched by Pan’s hospitality, Guan Yu declined. “You’ve heard of my… situation. Matters need handling. Next time, I’ll bring fine wine.”

“Fair enough. Off you go, then.”

“Please watch over Ling’er and Jia Bo.” With a wave, Guan Yu sped off on his motorcycle. He’d forgotten to call A’me, who’d likely waited all night.

**Chapter 1951: A Simple Meal**

A’me, left alone since Xue Jing returned to J City, might have stayed up fearing the dark. By 4 AM, Guan Yu raced home, dreading her exhaustion. Yet the villa was dark, a note on the table: *“At Conghan’s. Food in kitchen. —A’me.”* Relieved, he crashed into bed.

By 9 AM, Xue Jing greeted him. “Eat before it’s cold. Your troubles are settled.”

“You sent Conghan for A’me?” Guan Yu asked.

“Who else? Knew you’d be late.” Her tone sharpened, but blame was absent.

Seeking to mend fences, Guan Yu proposed dinner at Yang Conghan’s. Xue Jing arched a brow. “Why? New ‘member’ joining?”

“Just a gathering. Your call on the venue.”

That evening, the mansion buzzed. A’me cooked while the others—Lan Yu, Lü Mei, and Zhang Han—played mahjong. Bickering erupted as usual.

“Hurry up! Did your breasts crush your brain?” Lan Yu snapped.

Zhang Han smirked, hefting her chest. “Jealousy’s ugly. Mine’s the mightiest!”

Guan Yu silenced them with a threat of kitchen duty.

At dinner, Zhang Han lunged for food. “Wash up!” Yang Conghan scolded, swatting her hand.

Later, Guan Yu feigned sleep, anticipating the thief. A familiar scent—incense—drifted in. Peering through a keyhole, he spotted half a spent stick. Inside, Zhang Han slept soundly, unharmed.

The mahjong spat resumed: “Big breasts, no brains! Slow as a slug!”

“Says the flat-chested crow!” Zhang Han shot back.

Guan Yu’s glare hushed them.

Post-feast, sleeping arrangements loomed. “I’ll take a room alone,” he declared, secretly on watch.

Midnight approached. A shadow moved—the thief. Guan Yu, acupoints sealed, crept out. At Zhang Han’s door, he found the drugged incense. Inside, she slept, oblivious. The trap was set.
