“Guanyu, I only want to become your woman, nothing more.” Du Xiaojuan suddenly looked up, her tear-filled eyes glistening like flowers.

Guanyu's heart ached.

This poor girl had endured so much hardship, yet still tried her best to please him. If he let go of such a woman, would he even be considered a man?

Guanyu walked over and embraced Du Xiaojuan tenderly. “You will be my woman for all eternity,” he whispered.

“Mmm.” Du Xiaojuan clung tightly to Guanyu, silently weeping in his arms.

“Heh, the night is short. Let’s not waste time on sorrows. We should attend to important matters,” Guanyu suddenly said with a mischievous grin.

“Mmm.” Du Xiaojuan shyly hummed in agreement.

Guanyu swept Du Xiaojuan into his arms. Holding her felt like cradling a piece of mutton-fat jade - smooth to the touch, with a figure so fiery it stirred his passions.

“Xiaojuan, you’re especially beautiful today!” Guanyu laid her on the bed, gazing at her silken form.

“Don’t look at me!” Crimson flooded Du Xiaojuan’s face as she closed her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest.

After a long moment, she felt a chill and opened her eyes to find Guanyu turned away. “Why haven’t you started yet?” she asked timidly.

“Start what?” Guanyu feigned ignorance.

“That...that thing.” Du Xiaojuan’s voice became barely audible.

Guanyu turned with suppressed laughter. “Didn’t you tell me not to look? I’ve been very obedient.”

“You...you’re terrible!” Du Xiaojuan pouted.

Their lips met. Du Xiaojuan wrapped her arms around Guanyu’s neck, clumsily responding to his kiss as her eyes grew hazy.

“Who lent you these clothes?” Guanyu murmured.

“Sister Wenqing did. She said...she said she wouldn’t come find you tonight.” Du Xiaojuan’s gentle voice held a note of mischief.

Guanyu chuckled. “All the better for us to be alone.”

As their passion escalated, insistent knocking interrupted them. “Guanyu! Open this door or I’ll come in myself!”

“We’ll ignore it,” Guanyu growled. But Du Xiaojuan panicked, pushing him away and scrambling to hide.

**Chapter 764: Who Do You Love More?**

The door burst open. Feng Xin strode in, hands on hips. “What’s this? Hiding your little pleasures under the bed on moving day?”

Mo Ling appeared, lifting the bedsheet to reveal the hidden women. “So this is why you didn’t come find us! Explain yourself, Guanyu! Who do you truly love most?”

The three women stared him down. Guanyu swallowed hard, caught between his lovers. “You’re all irreplaceable to me—”

“No excuses!” Mo Ling interrupted. “There’s always a favorite. Who is it?”

Guanyu scratched his head. “If I could have you all together—”

“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Feng Xin sneered.

As the women argued, Guanyu realized his night of passion had turned into a minefield of feminine wiles. The real challenge wasn’t in the bedroom - it was navigating the storm of his lovers’ demands.
