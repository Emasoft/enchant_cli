“Hehe, someone like me, the queen of nightclubs, is fine with just having fun. But if I were to get a boyfriend who’d control this and that, I couldn’t stand it!” Chen Si chuckled.

“Then you’re deliberately pushing me into a pit of fire. I can’t stand it either!” Wen Ya retorted irritably.

**Chapter 854: The Key Is Lost**

“Wenwen, do you have a boyfriend?” Chen Si asked cautiously.

“No!” Wen Ya replied.

“Hmm, I remember now. Last time in the dance studio, didn’t you hold hands and dance with some guy from the school in front of everyone? Which one was it? Let me think…” Chen Si pouted, deep in thought.

Suddenly, her eyes lit up. “I remember! His name is Guan Yu! Wenwen, is he your boyfriend?”

“No!”

Hearing Guan Yu’s name, Wen Ya’s face turned cold, her entire demeanor shifting.

“This Guan Yu seems pretty ordinary. Wenwen, how did you take a liking to him?” Chen Si mused, oblivious to Wen Ya’s change.

“I told you he’s not! I don’t even know him. Sisi, stop guessing. I don’t have a boyfriend and won’t meet those rich guys you keep introducing me to!” Wen Ya snapped impatiently.

Seeing Wen Ya’s insistence, Chen Si sighed. “Wenwen, these past two years have been so hard for you. You’ve sacrificed everything for your family, unable to do what you want. I’ve watched it all, and it breaks my heart.”

“I wanted to help, but you refused. I know your personality—I won’t force you. But you can’t keep going alone forever. You need someone to walk beside you! We’re not made of steel; we need warmth and hugs. Just meet the guys I’ve picked. If none suit you, treat it as a chance to relax, okay?”

Chen Si looked at Wen Ya pleadingly.

Wen Ya sighed deeply. “Only this once. No next time!”

Chen Si beamed. “I promise! These guys are handpicked. One will suit you!”

“I just want you to have a good birthday, not lonely like before. It hurts me to see you alone every year,” Wen Ya said.

Chen Si paused, then smiled genuinely.

**Chapter 855: The Dance Studio Theft**

Wen Ya woke naturally, exhausted from yesterday’s dance practice. She tried to stretch but winced in pain.

Chen Si burst into the dorm. “Wenwen, did you hear? Thieves struck the dance studio last night! Equipment’s gone or smashed. Thank God you left early—it could’ve been dangerous!”

Wen Ya paled. She frantically searched her wardrobe.

“What’s wrong?” Chen Si asked.

“The key… It’s gone! The dance studio key!” Wen Ya muttered, distraught.

“So what? Just get a new one!” Chen Si shrugged.

“But if the thief found it—”

“Ms. Wen, the leadership wants to see you,” a student interrupted.

In the secretary’s office, police officers awaited.

“Where’s the key to Building Six’s dance studio?” Secretary Wang demanded.

“I lost it last night,” Wen Ya admitted.

“Lost? Then explain this!” Wang slammed a plastic bag containing the key onto his desk.

“That’s my key! How did you find it there?” Wen Ya stammered.

“At the crime scene! You’re the prime suspect!” Wang roared.

“I didn’t do it!” Wen Ya protested.

“Your fingerprints are on the key. Explain that!”

“I’m innocent!”

**Chapter 856: Helpless**

“We suspect your involvement in the theft. Cooperate or face arrest!” Officer Zheng threatened.

Wang interjected, “Let’s resolve this quietly.”

“She’s wasting our time!” Zheng snapped.

Wen Ya trembled, tears welling. “I’m not a thief!”

But the evidence loomed. Despair overwhelmed her.
