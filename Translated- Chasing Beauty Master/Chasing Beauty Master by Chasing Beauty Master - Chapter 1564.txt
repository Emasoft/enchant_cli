Guan Yu said, “They certainly will. The Imperial Guards will not let Ao Tian Manor off easily. They will most likely take men to search the manor for Your Highness. If I’m not mistaken, Ao Tian Manor is likely a sea of blood by now.”

Prince Zou sighed remorsefully. “This is all my fault. I failed to foresee such consequences. The tragedy at Ao Tian Manor was caused by me. I’ve wronged those who perished.”

“Your Highness need not dwell on this,” Guan Yu reassured. “Outcomes are difficult to predict when no ill intent was involved. There’s no need for excessive self-reproach.”

After these events, Prince Zou resolved to avoid involving acquaintances in the future, lest he bring calamity upon them.

The centurion and his men slaughtered everyone they encountered at Ao Tian Manor. Those remaining were herded into the courtyard for inspection. Finding no trace of Prince Zou, the enraged centurion ordered all survivors executed. Overnight, Ao Tian Manor was erased from the martial world. Though rumors of Imperial Guard involvement spread, tarnishing their reputation.

Though Ao Tian Manor had been an obscure foothold in the jianghu, the massacre of over a hundred souls in one night sent shockwaves through the realm. Whispers spread that evidence at the scene implicated the Imperial Guards.

News swiftly reached the capital, entering the ears of many powerful figures – even the Emperor himself. Seizing this opportunity, the Emperor summoned Minister Qi for questioning.

“Your Majesty, what urgent matter requires this humble servant’s presence?” Minister Qi knelt in the imperial study.

The Emperor, appearing haggard with streaks of white in his beard, studied the elderly minister. His round face with high nose bridge bore the classic “pork kidney” shape of imperial lineage. “Rise, Minister Qi. I’ve heard your Imperial Guards massacred a place called Ao Tian Manor. Is this true?”

Having anticipated this inquiry, Minister Qi stood slowly. His snow-white beard and wrinkled complexion made him appear even older than the Emperor. “Your Majesty speaks true. This old servant did indeed dispatch men there.”

“What justification could you possibly have for such annihilation? What crimes did Ao Tian Manor commit?”

“They harbored a wanted criminal, Your Majesty. When negotiations failed, we had no choice but to act.” The lie slipped smoothly from Minister Qi’s lips.

Though seeing through the deception, the Emperor restrained himself. Minister Qi’s court influence and lack of concrete evidence made direct confrontation unwise. “Do you take me for a doddering fool?” the Emperor suddenly thundered. “I know what games you play! While I’ve tolerated your schemes, this public disgrace reflects poorly on the Imperial Guards – and by extension, the royal house itself!”

Minister Qi dropped to his knees again. “Your Majesty! This servant acts solely for the empire’s benefit! No personal motives taint my actions!”

The Emperor sighed wearily. The political web ensnared even his own son, the Second Prince, whom Minister Qi served. To move against the minister meant challenging his own heir. “Rise. This debacle has shamed both the Imperial Guards and the throne itself. You will rectify this mess. The Guards represent the royal face – contain your men’s recklessness. No more blatant errors!”

The Emperor’s meaning was clear: cease overt actions against Prince Zou. Ao Tian Manor had been a step too far. Though unable to stop the persecution entirely, the Emperor demanded discretion. Further scandals would warrant more than warnings.

Had Prince Zou known the Imperial Guards’ arrogance remained unchecked, his faith in imperial justice might have crumbled entirely. Without royal intervention, continuing to the capital would prove futile.

Minister Qi recognized the need for subtler methods. Direct Imperial Guard involvement must cease temporarily. The Emperor’s order to quell public outrage presented challenges. With Ao Tian Manor destroyed and over a hundred slain, popular resentment against the Guards’ brutality ran high. The massacre’s sheer scale invited comparisons to banditry.

Faced with irrefutable evidence, Minister Qi resorted to theatrical appeasement. Several “Imperial Guards” – actually common criminals from the prison – were publicly executed as scapegoats. He orchestrated a grand apology ceremony, compensating victims’ families and begging forgiveness from the realm. These spectacles aimed to salvage the Guards’ reputation.

Meanwhile, Prince Zou’s party reached the southern city of Ha’er without incident. Taking rooms at an inn, they conducted security checks before settling. The traumatized prince insisted all retainers share his quarters – even veteran commanders like Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao. Guan Yu’s group occupied adjacent rooms. This arrangement, while cramped, allowed swift response to any attack.

During their evening meal, Prince Zou proposed: “We should rest here several days. Recruit reinforcements before continuing.”

Guan Yu nodded. “If I may suggest – knowing our adversaries are the Imperial Guards, whose power exceeds imagination, our small group cannot hope to reach the capital safely. Relying solely on Your Highness’ connections and local magistrates’ forces proves inadequate against them. We should instead employ martial artists – spend silver to hire jianghu elements.”

“You propose hiring mercenaries?” Zou Wuhui objected. “We’re imperial subjects! The martial world wants nothing to do with court affairs. They’d either refuse or provide half-hearted service.”

“Your view is shortsighted,” Guan Yu countered. “Court and jianghu have always been intertwined beneath surface propriety. With sufficient silver, we can secure desperate warriors – even outlaws. Their protection would greatly enhance Your Highness’ safety.”

A captain nodded agreement. “Master Lao Cang speaks truth. While reputable sects maintain public distance from the court, countless covert alliances exist.”

Prince Zou recalled his unanswered plea to the Cloud Azure Sect. Would Patriarch Xuanming send aid? That uncertainty gnawed at him.

Guan Yu pressed on: “Silver can buy skilled swordsmen – mountain bandits, wanted fugitives. Their ilk would serve eagerly.”

“Preposterous!” Zou Wuhui protested. “Harboring criminals? They’d be powder kegs beside us! Moreover, employing those the court hunts...”

“These are extraordinary times!” Guan Yu interrupted. “When Imperial Guards openly hunt a prince, normal rules collapse. Should the court protest our methods, let them first explain the Guards’ lawlessness! Even His Majesty would struggle to condemn defensive measures.”

The logic silenced objections. Prince Zou finally ruled: “Master Guan’s counsel holds wisdom. Survival outweighs protocol. Wuxiao – investigate potential recruits. Cost is no barrier.”

Turning to Guan Yu, the prince added: “Perhaps you have contacts? Protection is paramount – terms are negotiable.”

After feigning contemplation, Guan Yu replied: “I have distant associates. Summoning them would require days...”

“Excellent! Make arrangements. Time we can spare.”

Zou Wuhui then presented a jewel-casket to Guan Yu. “No words suffice for your lifesaving deeds,” Prince Zou said. “Accept this small token.”

The glittering contents could ransom kings. Guan Yu demurred: “Your previous gold remains ample. These treasures should fund our recruitment.”

“Keep them for that purpose,” the prince insisted. “My veteran commanders require no rewards – their loyalty is unquestioned. You outsiders merit different consideration.”

As Guan Yu reluctantly accepted, merchant-looking strangers entered the inn. Their conversation froze the room:

“Lucky we arrived late at Ao Tian Manor! Earlier and we’d be dead!”

“What ill fortune! An entire manor destroyed to catch one man? Slaughtering innocents – pure banditry!”

Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu turned to them: “Pardon – did you say Ao Tian Manor was massacred? An entire manor? How horrific!”
