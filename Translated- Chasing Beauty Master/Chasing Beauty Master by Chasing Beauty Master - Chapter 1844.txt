Guan Yu and Chu Fan sat in spacious chairs. Sister Mei, wearing a gentle smile, approached Guan Yu and began, “Young Master Wan Hong, welcome back. I heard you particularly enjoy our aged Nu’er Hong wine. As I happened to be free, I’ve specially brought two jars for you. Consider them my treat—please enjoy at your leisure.”

Guan Yu, surprised by such deference, quickly stood up. “Ah, this is too kind! I’m truly honored by your personal attention, Sister Mei. My deepest thanks!” He accepted the two jars of aged wine with both hands.

**Chapter 4845: An Unexpected Gesture**

This development startled Guan Yu. Sister Mei was a figure renowned throughout the capital, someone even palace nobility hesitated to provoke. From Jiang Yuan Kai, Guan Yu had learned of her extraordinary status. Though nominally the manager of the prestigious Ten Thousand Seas Pavilion, her influence far exceeded her title.

The pavilion catered exclusively to the capital’s elite. Over years of hosting dignitaries, Sister Mei had cultivated connections with every powerful figure in the city—including the Second Prince herself. Her social acumen and web of alliances made her untouchable. To offend her was to court the wrath of the entire capital’s aristocracy. Some even claimed it safer to slight the Emperor than cross Sister Mei.

This being only his second visit, Guan Yu never imagined she would personally serve him wine. While he initially dismissed it as staff being overburdened, her offering of premium wine as complimentary hospitality left him bewildered. What merit had he shown to earn such favor?

“You flatter me, Young Master,” Sister Mei replied. “Though our acquaintance is brief, tales of your courage have reached my ears—particularly your fearless confrontation with the Cao Family despite their might. To hold your ground against one of the Four Great Families is remarkable indeed.”

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed. Her words seemed layered with implication. How could she claim he’d suffered no losses? The Red Charm Theater’s destruction and numerous casualties marked a devastating blow. Could she know about his covert sabotage of three Cao enterprises? Impossible—he’d been thoroughly disguised.

“I’m but a reckless man opposing the Cao’s injustices,” he demurred. “This generous gift leaves me speechless with gratitude.”

“You honor us with your presence,” she deflected. “Please visit often—as a friend, not mere patron.” Her excessive courtesy puzzled him.

After she withdrew, Chu Fan eyed Guan Yu curiously. “Since when do you command such respect? That woman bows to no one—not even the Second Prince receives such treatment.”

“Perhaps she wants my silver,” Guan Yu shrugged.

“Unlikely,” Chu Fan countered. “Sister Mei is impervious to flattery and wealth. Her courtesy suggests deeper interest.”

“My notoriety precedes me, it seems,” Guan Yu chuckled ruefully. “Though I’ve barely been here a week.”

As they sipped the fragrant wine, Chu Fan reminisced, “Last time I came with Jiang Xin. I’ve always disliked rubbing shoulders with these ‘nobles’—all polished manners hiding daggers beneath.”

Guan Yu nodded. Beneath the pavilion’s glittering surface swirled undercurrents of betrayal. Here, alliances were as fragile as rice paper.

**Chapter 4846: Lofty Standards**

Elsewhere, Tang Muchen (Wood Dust) of the Four Great Families’ Tang Clan observed newcomers Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. Renowned for his striking looks and noble bearing, the young master prided himself on discerning taste. Common women bored him; today’s fresh faces intrigued.

Wang Xiaorong’s exquisite beauty and Qiqi’s youthful charm stood out among the capital’s jaded socialites. Unlike the celebrated Jiang Xin and Duan Ruxue—the capital’s twin jewels—these were unpolished gems.

As scion of the prestigious Tang Clan, Tang Muchen enjoyed women’s constant attentions. Yet he disdained easy conquests, relishing the chase. His pursuit of Jiang Xin had once seen him besiege the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence daily with gifts, until the Princess Royal discovered his harem of admirers and barred him permanently.

Now his gaze lingered on the newcomers. “Such perfection,” he murmured, adjusting his brocade robes. A challenge worthy of his skills.

**Chapter 4847: The Dashing Arrival**

“Sister Xiaorong, look!” Qiqi whispered excitedly. “A real handsome man over there!”

Wang Xiaorong glanced at the preening noble. “Passable, though no match for our Wan Hong.”

Catching their appraisal, Tang Muchen sauntered over with practiced charm. “Ladies, you seem new here. May I assist?”

“Are you hitting on us?” Qiqi blurted, tilting her head.

The directness flustered him. “I—well—merely offering guidance. I’m Tang Muchen of the Four Great Families’ Tang Clan.” He puffed his chest. “Might I recommend the osmanthus cakes? Exquisite.”

Wang Xiaorong tugged Qiqi’s sleeve. “Don’t chatter with strangers.”

“But he’s pretty! And rich!” Qiqi protested, reaching for a pastry. “Which one’s sweetest, Handsome Sir?”

Tang Muchen’s smile tightened. This would require more finesse than usual.
