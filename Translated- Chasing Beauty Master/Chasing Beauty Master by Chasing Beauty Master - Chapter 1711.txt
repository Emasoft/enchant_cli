When Guan Yu arrived later, I heard from him that you even mistook him for a villain and arrested him at Convergence Peak. That’s when I realized you weren’t the perfect match for Yan Zhao that everyone claimed. That’s when I knew you were undoubtedly Guan Yu’s type.”

Siqi didn’t fully grasp what Wang Jun meant, but she sensed he was implying she and Guan Yu were destined to be together rather than her and Yan Zhao. Curiously, she asked, “Why do you feel that way? Can you really read fortunes?”

Wang Jun chuckled. “When it comes to Guan Yu’s romantic fate, I certainly can. Any exceptionally beautiful woman who crosses his path inevitably becomes his. None can escape.”

*Oh no*, Wang Jun thought, realizing he’d said too much—and revealed things he shouldn’t have. But it was too late to take it back. Siqi stared at him with keen interest.

“Then tell me,” Siqi asked calmly, her expression neutral, “aside from me, which other women have you seen who are ‘undoubtedly Guan Yu’s’?”

Wang Jun cleared his throat. “Well…none for now. Don’t overthink it. Guan Yu is destined for greatness—his future is immeasurable. Besides, he doesn’t belong here. You know that, right?”

He deliberately shifted the topic, hoping Siqi wouldn’t press further. If Guan Yu found out he’d been so loose-lipped, there’d be hell to pay.

“That Guan Yu doesn’t belong here… I’ve heard whispers,” Siqi said. “But he’s never mentioned it himself. I only know his homeland is very far away. Do you understand this matter well?”

Wang Jun, relieved by the diversion, replied, “Of course. Aside from Guan Yu himself, I might know best. We’re from the same place—shared roots, you could say.”

“Oh! So you’re fellow countrymen!” Siqi laughed. “No wonder you two are so close. Since you know so much, could you tell me about your homeland?”

“Certainly. We’ve time now.” Wang Jun settled in, eager to recount tales of their world. “Our homeland is entirely different from here—a separate reality. The things you see here…they’d only exist in our history books or dramas. You’ve never heard of ‘TV,’ right? Let me explain…”

He described televisions, their school days, and Guan Yu’s legendary status. “He was the center of attention, adored by countless girls. His family was wealthy, a true magnate. Later, I learned he had two formidable older sisters. Guan Yu always shone brighter than any rival—crushing anyone who crossed him. Most importantly,” Wang Jun emphasized, “he *never* lets his women come to harm. He protects them fiercely.”

“He…*protects* them well?” Siqi’s voice tightened, her mind swirling.

Wang Jun mentally kicked himself. Siqi was in the throes of budding romance with Guan Yu. If she discovered the women he kept in Qiaoyuan District… *Disaster*. He clamped down, refusing to say more.

“But that’s trivial,” Wang Jun deflected again. “Guan Yu never seeks trouble, but if provoked, he retaliates ruthlessly—leaving opponents broken.”

“I’ve seen that,” Siqi nodded. Guan Yu never instigated conflicts, yet trouble found him. She wanted to ask about the “protected women” but held back, sensing Wang Jun’s reluctance. *Better to hear it from Guan Yu himself*, she decided.

Restless, Siqi dwelled on Wang Jun’s words. Guan Yu’s homeland fascinated her. If possible, she longed to visit it—to understand him fully.

Wang Jun knew he’d said too much. Another word, and Guan Yu’s secrets would spill—along with his own blood. “I’ll go speak to A-Zhe,” he announced, standing abruptly. “That fool keeps flipping tents in his sleep. Needs a lesson.” He hurried off, leaving Siqi’s questions hanging.

Siqi’s thoughts churned. Wang Jun’s half-spoken hints about Guan Yu’s past lovers gnawed at her. Did he have a wife back home? Children? The possibility unsettled her. Yet Wang Jun’s words painted Guan Yu as irresistible—any beauty he encountered became “his.” Was he…a philanderer?

She glanced at Guan Yu, busy with some task. Brilliant, charming—exactly the man Wang Jun described. Young women would naturally gravitate to him. If he already had a family… Could she bear it?

But she’d fallen for him first. And Guan Yu was no ordinary man—a dual cultivator of magic and martial arts, destined to shake the jianghu. Loving such a man required acceptance. Wang Jun claimed even in their homeland, Guan Yu was a legend. Siqi’s jealousy prickled.

That night, bundled in a tent against the desert winds, Siqi finally asked, “Guan Yu… Do you have a wife? Children back home?”

He blinked, startled. “No wife. No children. But I won’t deny past…companions. They’re not the same as a spouse.”

“I see.” She feigned nonchalance, relieved by his candor. With Guan Yu, everything felt secure. “Tell me about your homeland. Wang Jun said you were extraordinary there too.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Modesty aside, I made waves. Led a gang—hundreds strong. Conquered cities. Our world’s nothing like here. Skyscrapers, neon nights… I’d take you there someday.”

“I’d love that.” Yet Siqi wondered—was his world even part of this reality? Guan Yu’s sealed memories complicated everything. “You’ll return once your封印 lifts?”

“Yes. But…” He hesitated, thinking of王小蓉 and琪琪. How would these women coexist? Best not to dwell yet.

**Chapter 4477: Provocations**

Ling Su seethed, watching their tent. At midnight, he stormed out, shouting, “Something’s out there!”—a petty attempt to disturb them.

“Probably a nightmare,” Guan Ya dismissed, but checked anyway. Ling Su lurked outside, spinning tales of “creatures” to rouse the camp.

“Enough!” Wang Jun snapped. “Sleep or leave!” Others glared—Ling Su’s earlier greed with silver had already soured moods.

Back in the tent, Guan Yu assured Siqi, “He’s harmless. But if he escalates…” The threat hung unspoken. Siqi nodded, though conflicted—Ling Su was still sect kin.

Ling Su roamed restlessly, bitterness festering. How dare Guan Yu claim *his* Siqi? He’d disrupt their peace all night if needed.

Yet with each shout, the camp’s resentment grew. Wang Jun’s final rebuke echoed: “Stop haunting us like a damned ghost!”
