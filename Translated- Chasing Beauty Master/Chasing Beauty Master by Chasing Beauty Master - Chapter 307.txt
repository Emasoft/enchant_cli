“Auntie, I’m partly responsible for Uncle Wen’s beating. I’ll go seek justice for him right now.” Guan Yu smiled, though his smile was cold, bone-chillingly cold.

He understood perfectly well that the mastermind behind Wen Songbai’s severe beating was Zhan Shouwang.

Zhan Shouwang’s retaliation, though sparked by Wen Ya, might not have resulted in Wen Songbai’s leg being crippled if Guan Yu hadn’t been involved. This was why Guan Yu was so enraged.

What he despised most in life was harming innocent people close to him. If someone had the guts to come at him directly—whether openly or through underhanded schemes—he wouldn’t fear it. But targeting those around him? Then he’d have no choice but to retaliate ruthlessly.

“Guan Yu, don’t act impulsively! Be careful!” Mei Fanglan called out as she watched Guan Yu and Wen Ya disappear.

“Old Wen, do you think Guan Yu might do something reckless?” Mei Fanglan asked, her face etched with worry.

“Possibly! It’s all my fault. Fanglan, go after them and see,” Wen Songbai said anxiously.

“Tsk,” Bald Qiang sneered, then forced a smile. “Uncle Wen, Aunt Mei, stop worrying. I swear, in N City, only Brother Yu’s women can bully him! No one else has that right!”

What? What did you say?

The elderly couple were stunned.

Guan Yu took Wen Ya straight to the campus. Wen Ya let him hold her hand, silent.

“Brother Yu, Zhan Shouwang is still in his dorm. I’ll take you there!” Wang Hao, after receiving Guan Yu’s instructions, had already tracked Zhan Shouwang’s whereabouts and blocked the dormitory entrance.

Guan Yu nodded.

Wang Hao cautiously observed Guan Yu’s expression—he’d never seen him so angry. “Brother Yu, should we gather people to kill that bastard?”

“No. I’ll handle this myself,” Guan Yu said.

“Got it.” Wang Hao grinned, knowing someone was about to suffer.

Guan Yu stormed into the dorm.

Zhan Shouwang, wearing boxers, leapt from his bed. Guan Yu kicked him, sending him crashing into a desk.

“Guan Yu, what the hell are you doing?!” Zhan Shouwang roared.

“I warned you not to do anything stupid. Why didn’t you listen?” Guan Yu sneered.

He turned to Wen Ya. “He broke your father’s leg. Let’s break one of his legs in return.”

“Yes!” Wen Ya said without hesitation.

Before Zhan Shouwang could finish his threat, Guan Yu shattered his kneecap.

“Is this satisfying enough?” Guan Yu asked Wen Ya, smiling.

Wen Ya paused, then said, “Break his other leg too, so he can’t harm anyone else!”

“You really don’t care about my well-being?” Guan Yu joked.

Wen Ya stormed out.

Guan Yu glared at Zhan Shouwang. “I don’t mind enemies coming at me directly, but I hate those who break the rules. You’re out of the game!”

The next day, newspapers reported Zhan Shouwang’s crimes, leading to his father’s downfall.

Zhan Shouwang, now crippled and fatherless, seethed with hatred.

“Do you want revenge? I can help,” Jiang Ziqi said, appearing in his hospital room.

“I want him dead!” Zhan Shouwang growled.

“Then use your life as collateral. Kill him, and I’ll send you abroad,” Jiang Ziqi offered.

Zhan Shouwang agreed.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu infiltrated the exclusive *Celebrity Club*, disguised as a gigolo.

“Handsome, let me book you for the night,” a middle-aged woman purred.

Guan宇 awkwardly declined, slipping away to investigate the club’s secrets.
