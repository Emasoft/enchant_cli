Guan Yu’s situation was similar. In Elder Lu’s eyes, Guan Yu had always been a sensible and upright child, arguably his most cherished disciple. Though not his direct apprentice, Guan Yu was still a disciple of the Qingyun Sect, and love for the temple extended to all its crows.

Elder Lu had no intention of confronting Guan Yu. Had it been anyone else, he would never have allowed it. But since the treasures ended up in Guan Yu’s hands, Elder Lu found some solace. Still, the thought of his lifelong collection being ransacked made his flesh ache as if flayed.

Guan Yu said, “Elder Lu, you must broaden your perspective. The treasures I took from you and Master will remain within the Qingyun Sect, never falling into outsiders’ hands. So there’s no cause for worry or disappointment. As for the Dragon’s Eye Amber—whether in your possession or Master’s—it remains a treasure of our sect. If the Qingyun prospers, we all prosper, no?”

“Does any of this nonsense relate to me losing my treasures for nothing?” Elder Lu grumbled sourly.

“But if I hadn’t taken your items, Master wouldn’t have obtained the Dragon’s Eye Amber either,” Guan Yu explained. “I’d grown dissatisfied with Master’s offerings and would’ve refused any exchange. Do you understand this logic?”

Observing Elder Lu’s conflicted expression—part comprehension, part bewilderment—Guan Yu knew the elder was still mulling it over.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu bowed and said, “Master, honored elders, if there’s nothing further, this disciple humbly takes his leave.”

With that, he tugged Wang Jun’s sleeve, and the two hurried away. Watching their retreating figures, Elder Lu complained bitterly, “What farce is this? Today I’ve been thoroughly outplayed!”

——————————

“Sect Master,” Elder Lu said indignantly, “you could at least show us that immortal artifact! Let me examine it properly—after all, I sacrificed countless treasures for it!”

“Naturally, I’ll display it for verification,” Xuan Ming replied, visibly relieved now that Guan Yu had departed. With the treasure finally secure and no challengers present, he produced the Dragon’s Eye Amber.

As the elders crowded around, Elder Zheng exclaimed first: “Indeed! The white Dragon’s Eye Amber—a true immortal artifact!”

Elder Lu’s eyes gleamed as he asked, “Sect Master, that rascal Guan Yu claimed he encountered an immensely powerful artifact spirit within. Could that be true?”

“I see no reason for him to lie,” Xuan Ming replied calmly, his joy evident. Anyone would be thrilled to obtain such a treasure, making his own losses feel trivial.

Elder Dai marveled, “So this is the legendary Dragon’s Eye Amber! Who could imagine such a small bead being a natural immortal artifact? Its beauty defies description!”

Xuan Ming swiftly reclaimed the amber, clearing his throat. “I shall study it thoroughly in due time. Unless there’s urgent business, you may all retire.”

His abruptness betrayed fear of covetous designs. Elder Lu shot him a sidelong glare, thinking: How petty!

Before departing, Elder Zheng bowed and said, “Sect Master, another matter requires your attention.”

“Speak freely,” Xuan Ming permitted, still in high spirits.

“My son recently brought home a young woman—orphaned, without kin, who fortuitously met him during his travels. They’ve developed deep affection and wish to marry.”

“Splendid news!” Elder Dai interjected. “Why not simply choose an auspicious date and inform the Sect Master?”

Elder Zheng continued, “But Sect Master, this girl possesses cultivated internal energy. After Guan Yu examined her, he declared her a martial prodigy with exceptional bone structure. I seek your permission to either induct her into our sect or allow my son to form a guardian bond with her.”

In the Qingyun Sect, even selecting guardians required elder approval—no casual arrangements permitted.

“Has her background been verified?” Xuan Ming inquired.

“Thoroughly investigated before my son brought her here. Her parents succumbed to prolonged illness due to poverty. Their paths crossed afterward in the jianghu.”

Nodding, Xuan Ming declared: “I trust your judgment and Xiao Zhi’s discernment. Normally she’d require interrogation, but I’ll grant exception. Proceed with selecting an auspicious date.”

Grateful, Elder Zheng withdrew. This matter held significance—Xiao Zhi being a key disciple, his choice of guardian demanded stringent scrutiny regarding lineage and sect affiliations. Xuan Ming’s rare leniency spared them bureaucratic hurdles.

After Elder Zheng left, Elder Lu remarked, “Our sect hasn’t celebrated in ages. With the younger generation maturing, perhaps joyous occasions might dispel lingering gloom.”

Chapter 4717: Justifications

The elders concurred. Elder Dai added, “I’d hoped my Convergence Peak might gain a female disciple. Though she’s a martial artist, I’d still observe her—martial training breeds resilience.”

“Guan Yu knows her,” Elder Lu contributed. “When Xiao Zhi first brought her, they visited me. She appears commendable. Guan Yu says her internal energy has condensed into a core, indicating years of training. With her innate talent, she might become a formidable master.”

Xuan Ming gazed pensively through the window. While martial artists couldn’t join the sect, they could become cultivators’ guardians. Nothing now obstructed Xiao Zhi and Du Bingyan’s union—only auspicious timing remained.

His thoughts drifted to a century past, post-Demon War. During travels, he’d saved a gravely injured man—later revealed as a renowned martial master in hiding. Spending tremendous spiritual power to heal him, Xuan Ming gained a decade-long guardian and friend. Though the man eventually left to pursue vengeance, his peerless abilities left an indelible impression.

Since then, no Qingyun cultivator had secured a worthy guardian—low-skilled candidates proved useless, while masters disdained subservience. Xiao Zhi’s situation was exceptional—a love match with a skilled martial artist.

Chapter 4718: Diverging Perspectives

Elder Zheng resumed: “Sect Master, Guan Yu raised another pertinent point.”

“Oh? Concerning what?” Xuan Ming asked warily, aware of Guan Yu’s cunning nature.

“When accompanying Xiao Zhi to Xuanzhong Peak, Guan Yu speculated that Miao City never contained the Eight-Sided Drum technique. Despite thorough searches by numerous parties, no clues emerged—not even from a demon girl Guan Yu befriended there. The Right Envoy of Demon Soul Sect killed the village chief without extracting information.”

Xuan Ming frowned. “These are known facts. What’s your point?”

“Guan Yu suspects the Eight-Sided Drum legend itself might be false—a ploy by the Demon Ancestor Meng Hua to incite conflict between righteous and demonic factions. He doubts even the Kyoto rumor.”

“Impossible!” Elder Xiang objected. “The first volume was found in Meng Hua’s tomb! Demon Soul Sect possesses it! Subsequent volumes must exist!”

Elder Zheng clarified: “Guan Yu questions the authenticity of the clues, not the technique itself. The Demon Ancestor likely planted false trails to perpetuate bloodshed.”

Elder Lu supported this: “Meng Hua founded the demonic path! He’d delight in leaving traps to ensnare greedy cultivators!”

Xuan Ming pondered. “Plausible. Yet even knowing this, factions will still pursue any lead. The technique’s allure overrides reason.”

Elder Zheng pressed: “Given this uncertainty, shouldn’t we reconsider the Kyoto expedition? Guan Yu noted historical inconsistencies—‘Snow-Covered Golden Hall’ references a bygone imperial structure. Modern Kyoto’s palace bears only the name, not the original gold construction.”

“My research confirms the Golden Hall existed under the First Emperor,” Xuan Ming countered. “Though rebuilt over millennia, the clue’s essence remains. However, no historical emperor had a winter birthday except the current crown prince’s father. This anomaly puzzles me.”

Elder Lu queried: “Are our sect’s records incomplete?”

“We’ve consulted extensively with elders,” Xuan Ming sighed. “No records match. This mystery deepens the enigma.”

Elder Zheng’s true aim emerged—to defend Guan Yu’s group. Their desert ordeal yielded no gains, yet Xuan Ming remained suspicious, even interrogating Siqi. Though her loyalty was unquestionable (raised since childhood in the sect), Xuan Ming’s distrust of Guan Yu persisted.

Elder Zheng concluded: “Given these doubts, shouldn’t we acknowledge their efforts? They nearly died pursuing what might be false leads. At least commend their dedication.”

Xuan Ming’s gaze hardened. “Commendation follows achievement. Until the Eight-Sided Drum’s truth is unveiled, judgment remains suspended.”

The unspoken tension lingered—a sect master’s suspicion against a disciple’s growing influence, against the backdrop of ancient schemes and modern ambitions.
