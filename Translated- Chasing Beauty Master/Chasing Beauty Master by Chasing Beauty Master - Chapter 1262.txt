Such a magical artifact was only slightly superior to the Yunqing Sword, truly unworthy of Guan Yu's attention. Yet by conventional standards, it still counted as a mid-grade artifact. When other disciples saw it, their eyes gleamed with undisguised envy.

Every disciple of the Yunqing Sect yearned for fine magical implements. Xiao Zhi's artifact was named the Daye Hu (Great Leaf Jar).

Though not renowned, this vessel carried its own legend. It was said to have been crafted from leaves. Many years ago, a cultivation master exploring the forest chanced upon a boy raised by wolves. Filthy and pitiable, the child moved the master's heart.

The master imparted a wisp of spiritual energy and basic cultivation techniques into the boy. Gathering fallen leaves on the spot, he forged them into this leaf-shaped jar. Thus originated the Daye Hu.

That the master could casually forge a mid-grade artifact from mere foliage spoke volumes about his prowess. Even the esteemed Elder Jiu from the Ancestral Shrine couldn't match this feat—forging artifacts required Elder Jiu to wait for auspicious moments and procure fine materials.

**Chapter 3244: Don’t Damage Comradeship**

While the entire sect revered Elder Jiu's cultivation, this anonymous master's casual creation of a mid-grade artifact revealed even greater mastery.

Xiao Zhi's confidence surged upon displaying his artifact. With A'Ze's support and Guan Yu's formidable presence, he felt assured against four opponents.

A'Cai sneered, “Well! Fancy using a chamber pot as your artifact! How... inventive of you Xuangzhong Peak disciples.”

“Mocking your own reflection?” Xiao Zhi shot back. “At least I don't clutch the shabbiest Yunqing Sword like some backwater bumpkin!”

As their barbed exchange escalated tensions, A'Ze remained silent—reasoning with unreasonable men only fed the flames.

“Don’t flaunt your father’s hand-me-downs!” A'Cai spat, face flushing. “I wouldn’t want that trash even if—”

“Trash you can’t obtain,” Xiao Zhi interrupted. “Produce something better or stop posturing.”

“How dare you slander us!” A'Cai roared. “Left Void Peak won’t be mocked! Teach these curs a lesson!”

As four blades rasped from scabbards, Guan Yu stepped between the factions. “Brothers, must we stain comradeship with blood? Words over swords.”

The stocky A'Cai glared up at the handsome newcomer, insecurity morphing into rage. “Who’re you, pretty boy? Scram before I soil your silks!”

Guan Yu maintained his smile. “This junior is Guan Yu of Tiger Head Peak.”

Murmurs rippled through onlookers. Recent rumors had painted Guan Yu as everything from three-headed demon to Xuanming’s secret disciple. Now they saw merely a composed youth.

“So the famed Guan Yu’s just a milk-fed whelp!” A'Cai jeered. “Run home before I—”

*Ptui!*

A gob of phlegm flew straight into A'Cai’s open mouth. Before he could react, Guan Yu snapped his jaw shut. The collective gasp turned to horrified silence as the bully swallowed involuntarily.

“Savory?” Guan Yu inquired pleasantly. “I’ve more if you’re peckish.”

Female disciples from Juhe Peak covered their mouths, mirroring A'Cai’s nausea. Siqi watched grimly—she’d anticipated retaliation, but not this crude humiliation.

Xiao Zhi and A'Ze gaped. They’d expected dominance, not this vulgar masterstroke.

**Chapter 3246: Reminder**

Guan Yu gazed down at the groaning A'Cai. “Repentance merits mercy. Remember—manners maketh man.”

Turning to the crowd, he declaimed, “Witness how peacemaking begets violence! When insults flew, I merely... clarified perspectives.”

This public account would deter Left Void Peak’s elders from retaliating—no master would defend such disgrace.

To the pale Wen Ming, Guan Yu suggested, “Best tend your comrade’s head wound. Bleeding out before tomorrow’s Six Peaks Tournament would be... inconvenient.”

As aides bandaged A'Cai, Wen Ming hissed, “This isn’t over!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Left Void’s ‘justice’ is wanting. Reap what you sow.”

Xiao Zhi and A'Ze approached, awestruck. “Let’s find libations,” Guan Yu proposed.

“Halt!” Wen Ming blocked their path. “Assaulting a sect brother demands reckoning!”

Guan Yu turned, smile intact. “Speak with steel then. But recall—your man struck first.”

“Using martial arts against cultivators is base!” Wen Ming countered. “Why would our sect leader take a brute as disciple?”

The crowd murmured—this touched their doubts. Guan Yu’s movements had indeed betrayed martial mastery.

“Since when do life-or-death struggles observe rules?” Guan Yu retorted. “Your comrade swung first. Should I have offered my neck?”

Wen Ming pressed, “A cultivator defeating a martial artist at close range proves nothing!”

Laughter died as realization dawned—Guan Yu moved with dual cultivation’s fluidity. Gasps erupted. “Arcane-Martial Dual Cultivation!” Xiao Zhi breathed.

**Chapter 3247: No Such Formalities**

The revelation electrified onlookers. Dual cultivators emerged once a millennium. No wonder sect leaders vied for him!

Guan Yu addressed Wen Ming: “Honorable brother, if rules bound survival, rabbits would lecture tigers. Now—will you obstruct us further?”

The crowd parted instinctively before Guan Yu’s advance. Wen Ming stood rigid, torn between face and sense.

As the trio departed, whispers chased them—of phlegm and dual cultivation, of humiliation and awe. Guan Yu’s name would haunt Left Void Peak’s nightmares henceforth.
