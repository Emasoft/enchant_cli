Xuanming answered honestly, “The current situation differs from before. The Demon Sect has been aggressively recruiting forces in recent years while gathering strength within Qujiang City. I suspect they’re planning something significant. Therefore, I intend to send these four disciples down the mountain to investigate and gather reliable intelligence. For this mission, I propose having the Merit Cauldron assist them.”

Elder Qing clasped her slender jade-like hands behind her back and raised her head, speaking solemnly, “It’s been a century, hasn’t it? A hundred years ago, we elders joined forces to defeat the Demon Sect’s leader. They’ve remained dormant all these years, but now they stir again. Your assessment seems correct—they must be plotting anew.”

“Your insight is peerless, Elder Qing. These four disciples possess exceptional cultivation talent. With the Merit Cauldron’s empowerment, they will undoubtedly bring glory to Cloud Azure Sect,” Xuanming pressed earnestly.

As Xuanming elaborated his reasoning, Elder Qing found his arguments sound. Sending senior leaders to investigate the Demon Sect’s ambiguous movements would indeed be excessive. Moreover, while Cloud Azure Sect had enjoyed prolonged peace, their progress stagnated compared to the Demon Sect’s rising talents. Empowering these disciples through the Merit Cauldron before dispatching them seemed prudent.

Elder Qing studied Guan Yu, Xiao Zhi, Siqi, and A Ze before nodding. “These disciples are extraordinary, particularly this Guan Yu!” Her finger suddenly pointed at the youth as her voice turned icy. “Explain what demonic artifact you’re concealing! Produce it immediately!”

“W-what? I have nothing! I swear, Elder Qing!” Guan Yu pleaded while inwardly calculating. *Is she bluffing? Or is this retaliation for accidentally seeing her bathing earlier?*

“Pathetic coward!” Elder Qing scoffed. “Approach me! Do you think I’ll devour you? Useless whelp!” Before Guan Yu could respond, her sleeve swept through the air, yanking him forward through invisible force. Her eyes narrowed. “Ah, merely a demon-tainted artifact. How curious—a junior disciple carrying multiple treasures? Where did you steal these?”

Guan Yu hastily explained, “Elder Qing, these were gifts! My master gave them when I joined, and this Blazing Heaven Furnace came from Uncle Lu! How could I possibly steal from such experts?”

*Must clarify thoroughly,* he thought anxiously. *If she withholds the Merit Cauldron over this misunderstanding, all is lost.*

Producing two artifacts, Guan Yu declared, “Master Xuanming bestowed this Soulfall Blade and Imperial Seal.” He then revealed the smoking furnace emitting faint dark tendrils—likely the source of detected demonic aura that showcased Elder Qing’s profound perception.

“This Blazing Heaven Furnace came from Uncle Lu,” he added strategically, “and the Imperial Seal’s stored magic was personally imbued by Grand Elder Jiu.”

“Oh?” Elder Qing’s demeanor softened imperceptibly at Grand Elder Jiu’s mention. “He preserved spells for a junior? Perhaps his advanced years haven’t been entirely wasted.” Her tone carried complex emotions, and Guan Yu intuited hidden affection between the elder and the white-haired grandmaster.

To worldly eyes, a youthful beauty loving an ancient man would suggest gold-digging. But here, Guan Yu sensed decades of unspoken history—perhaps star-crossed lovers separated by circumstances, their close proximity yet eternal distance evidenced by her earlier bitter mutterings about Grand Elder Jiu avoiding her.

“Indeed, when I first joined, I resided with Grand Elder Jiu at the Ancestral Hall for over a month. We share a close bond,” Guan Yu ventured, testing the waters.

Elder Qing’s brow furrowed with centuries-accumulated sorrow. Xuanming interjected gently, “Elder Qing, the past has passed. Please don’t dwell—”

“Enough,” she cut him off, recomposing herself. “Have you sought ancestral approval for using the Merit Cauldron?”

“We petitioned at the Ancestral Hall beforehand,” Xuanming confirmed. “We humbly request your permission.”

“Fortune favors you,” she conceded. “The cauldron’s power currently peaks with radiant seven-hued energy. Had you delayed years longer, its overflowing essence would have been mine alone.” Her gaze swept the group. “Know this—I am now Cloud Azure’s foremost cultivator. My rejuvenated appearance stems not merely from cultivation, but... borrowings from the cauldron’s surplus energies over decades.”

As stone walls rumbled open, revealing a dust-choked passage, the disciples marveled while elders remained impassive. The tunnel’s polished marble-like surfaces suggested mystical construction. Descending deep into the mountain’s belly, their夜明珠 glow revealed a final stone door.

Within the inner sanctum, the legendary Merit Cauldron awaited—a gem sculpted like an incense burner, pulsating with prismatic radiance. “Commence immediately,” Elder Qing ordered, nose wrinkled at the dusty environment. “This wretched place disagrees with me.”

As elders channeled their power, rainbow energies flowed into the seated disciples. While others basked in blissful absorption, Guan Yu suddenly convulsed, screaming as agonizing visions flooded his mind. Elder Qing’s probing spiritual energy revealed a terrifying anomaly—a swirling black vortex within his consciousness, defying all known cultivation principles.

“What abyssal force dwells in this boy?” she whispered, awestruck and alarmed, as the black hole began devouring her sent energy...
