After Guan Yu finished speaking, the three women at the table were stunned. They hadn’t expected him to actually issue such a severe punishment. While skipping a single day’s meal might not be a big deal for most—leaving them merely hungry—Hanhan and Lv Mei were famously voracious eaters who could devour endless amounts without gaining weight.

Hanhan, in particular, relied on snacks like oxygen. Depriving her of regular meals might be manageable, but withholding her snacks? That would be torture. She’d grown up surrounded by snack piles, and a day without them was unimaginable.

Guan Yu added sternly, “To ensure you learn your lesson, a single day’s punishment seems too lenient. Starting now, the first offense is one day, the second two days, and so on!”

Though startled by his uncharacteristic severity, none of the women dared protest. This was the first time Guan Yu had ever lost his temper at home, and the icy atmosphere silenced even their usual boldness. Xue Jing inwardly blamed herself for provoking him, hoping Hanhan wouldn’t hold it against her.

Guan Yu, determined to leave no room for negotiation—especially with someone as stubborn as Hanhan—declared, “After breakfast, Ah Mei, dispose of all leftovers and confiscate every snack from Hanhan’s room. They’ll fast today. If they still don’t learn, we’ll extend it tomorrow.”

The sudden enforcement shocked everyone, stiffening the air. Ah Mei paled, unprepared for the immediate consequences. Soft-hearted and newly arrived, she risked Guan Yu’s wrath to plead, “Guan Yu, give them one warning first! Punish them next time instead—”

“No!” Guan Yu feigned anger. “They need this lesson. Follow my orders: no food, no leaving the house. And if I catch you sneaking them meals, you’ll join their punishment.”

Xue Jing and Yingzi exchanged worried glances, but Ah Mei reluctantly obeyed. As Guan Yu turned to the TV, his phone rang—an unknown number.

Answering, he heard Second Only to Wolf’s voice: “Where’d you vanish last night? Why didn’t you use the signal device I gave you?”

“Did you find Yingshan Gu?” Guan Yu countered.

“No. If I had, would I be calling?”

Guan Yu sighed. “After you left, Da Bai and Xiao Hei ambushed me, demanding the treasure map. I lured them to a remote spot and took them down—barely.”

“That serious?” Second Only to Wolf sounded alarmed. “Why not signal for help?”

“You were too far. Triggering it would’ve provoked them sooner.”

The names Da Bai and Xiao Hei meant nothing to Second Only to Wolf, who wasn’t versed in China’s underworld infamy. “Someone’s spreading rumors about the map to target you,” he deduced.

“Obviously the Feng Family,” Guan Yu replied. “They’re desperate to shift attention. But first, I need to find Yingshan Gu. I’m visiting someone today who might help.”

After hanging up, Guan Yu resolved to contact Jin Hua through Ling’er—a safe intermediary under the Yang Family’s nose.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei called: “My dad booked a meeting at Houyuan Temple in the northern woods. Some monks want to meet you.”

Guan Yu recognized the temple, nestled on steep cliffs. “Monks? Friends of your father?”

“They’re visiting from out of town. Heard about you and want to connect.”

Reluctantly agreeing, Guan Yu later drove to Houyuan Temple with Xue Jing.

“Since when do you visit temples?” she asked.

“Wei’s father’s friends. Harmless, probably.”

The temple, though grand, lacked prestige due to its young, inexperienced monks. Recently, drifters—drawn by treasure map rumors—had flocked there, avoiding city bustle. The monks, strictly vegetarian, forbade alcohol and meat but welcomed all genders.

Approaching the mountain’s serpentine road, Guan Yu noted the overgrown path. At the crimson gate, four monks emerged—one a towering, bearded giant.

Wei Hongwei rushed out, grinning. “These are Dad’s friends!”

The monks bowed, their formal greetings grating on Guan Yu. “Drop the ‘Venerable Benefactor’ talk. Just call me Guan Yu.”

The giant monk chuckled gruffly, “Fair enough! Come in.”

Inside the weathered main hall, a colossal bronze Buddha loomed, dust-coated and awe-inspiring. As Guan Yu sat, he assessed the monks—naïve curiosity masking potential ulterior motives.

Wei Hongwei whispered, “They’re just curious about the treasure map. Play nice?”

Guan Yu nodded, though vigilance lingered. In the temple’s shadowed corners, even piety could cloak greed.
