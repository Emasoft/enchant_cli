“Heh, let’s not call it a threat. I merely wish to inform Young Master Jiang that my friend’s value far surpasses that of yours!”

Li Yu replied with a faint smile, inadvertently extending an olive branch to Jiang Ziji.

“He’s not my friend!” Jiang Ziji retorted bluntly.

The idea of befriending Guan Yu and enduring that insufferable face daily would be worse than death! Yet this answer took Li Yu completely by surprise.

If they weren’t friends, why would Jiang Ziji go to such lengths—even risking a feud with him—to reclaim the money for Guan Yu? Li Yu refused to believe Jiang Ziji was some righteous do-gooder. There had to be hidden motives.

“Save your speculation—it’s useless!” Jiang Ziji impatiently cut him off, refusing to explain or admit being Guan Yu’s subordinate in any capacity. Acknowledging that truth would be torture!

“Enough pretense. Let me make this clear: I’m taking that money today. Whether you keep the five million or your precious Prosperity Guild depends entirely on your choice!”

Jiang Ziji dropped all subtleties. If Li Yu refused, further talk was pointless. A blunt ultimatum would suffice.

**Chapter 960: Suffering in Silence**

Money or the guild.

The words dripped with audacity coming from Jiang Ziji. To Li Yu, they were pure mockery.

“Young Master Jiang, leave room for future dealings. Must you be so ruthless?” Li Yu’s voice turned icy.

“Hmph. There’ll be no ‘future dealings’ between us!” Jiang Ziji snapped, angered by Li Yu’s veiled threats.

“Don’t think your Prosperity Guild’s current success makes you untouchable. Many turn a blind eye, but rest assured—if someone wants to crush you, they’ll find both means and justification!”

Li Yu’s brow furrowed as he weighed these words.

Noticing his hesitation, Jiang Ziji pressed harder: “You know better than anyone the guild’s dirty secrets. But let me remind you—nothing stays hidden forever. Those who need to know already do.

“Choose wisely: the money or your empire. The decision rests solely with you.”

Jiang Ziji’s tone brooked no argument. Backed by his formidable status, he had every right to such boldness. Li Yu’s evasiveness had worn his patience thin.

Was five million worth this dance? Yet Jiang Ziji also seethed inwardly—how could the mighty Prosperity Guild fail to handle a mere Guan Yu? Their incompetence deserved this humiliation.

Li Yu’s eyes flickered with suppressed murderous intent, quickly masked. Though a powerful figure in the capital, he dared not provoke the forces behind Jiang Ziji.

A commoner doesn’t fight officials—let alone a thief against soldiers. The power imbalance left no room for error. One misstep could doom both him and the guild.

Moreover, he believed Jiang Ziji’s threats. Rumors of the Jiang heir’s influence were well-founded. Offending him was unthinkable.

After a tense silence, Li Yu forced a laugh. “Young Master Jiang exaggerates! The Prosperity Guild operates with integrity. Since you’ve made the request personally, how could I refuse? Zhongxing—transfer five million to Young Master Jiang’s account immediately!”

Having weighed the scales, he bowed to power. The requester’s identity left no choice.

“Not to me—to Guan Yu’s account,” Jiang Ziji corrected grimly. The name tasted bitter, but neglecting Guan Yu’s demands risked that accursed bloodworm’s agony.

To Li Yu, this correction spoke volumes. What power did Guan Yu wield to command such obedience from a Jiang scion? The enigma deepened.

“Of course. The guild never questions Young Master Jiang’s instructions,” Li Yu smiled, carefully framing the transfer as compliance to Jiang’s authority—not Guan Yu’s.

Jiang Ziji saw through the wordplay but refused to bear blame. “This account belongs solely to Guan Yu. Our business here is done. Don’t disappoint me.”

With that, he strode out, shame burning his chest. Every step aiding Guan Yu felt like self-betrayal.

Watching him leave, Li Yu’s composure shattered. His fists clenched until nails drew blood. The humiliation scalded—a trap set for Guan Yu had snared himself instead.

“Qing Shu! Transfer the funds to Guan Yu now!” he snarled.

Advisor Chang Qing hesitated. “But Young Master, this wastes our best chance to eliminate him—”

“Are you deaf?!” Li Yu wheeled, eyes bloodshot.

Chang Qing bowed hastily. “At once.”

Alone, Li Yu trembled with rage. A kick sent a tea table crashing. Shattered porcelain littered the floor, mirroring his fractured plans.

This was suffering in silence—a perfect scheme undone by variables. Instead of ensnaring Guan Yu, he’d lost five million and face. The sum wasn’t trivial, but the deeper cut was Guan Yu’s mystifying survival.

The defeat didn’t quell Li Yu’s hatred—it fanned the flames.

**Chapter 961: Redirected Fury**

Swallowing bitterness, Li Yu’s wrath found no outlet. Part of him yearned to storm Guan Yu’s lair, but past failures gave pause. Guan Yu’s uncanny ability to strike lethally when least expected made him dangerously unpredictable.

Two major losses—yesterday’s disastrous race costing nearly a year’s profits, plus this extortion—taught harsh lessons. Guan Yu was no ordinary foe.

Seated amid cigar smoke, Li Yu’s calm facade hid scheming. Suddenly, he crushed the half-smoked cigar. “Huang Zhongxing! Get in here!”

The underling scurried in, sweat beading his brow. Responsible for vetting race participants, his oversight had allowed Guan Yu’s infiltration—a fatal error.

“You’ve outdone yourself,” Li Yu sneered.

Zhongxing collapsed to his knees. “Forgive me, Young Master! One more chance—”

“Chance? The guild’s losses demand a hundred deaths!”

“I know my negligence cost dearly—”

“You know nothing!” Li Yu roared. “Your blunder didn’t just lose money—it birthed an existential threat! Compared to Guan Yu, those millions are nothing!”

Zhongxing paled, finally grasping the magnitude.

“You could’ve secured the guild’s triumph. Instead, you gifted us an enemy capable of annihilation!”

The underling kowtowed. “Spare me! I’ll redeem myself!”

Li Yu kicked him away. “Redemption? Your loyalty is a liability. But... there is one way.”

Zhongxing clutched the lifeline. “Anything!”

“Find who helped Guan Yu place those massive external bets. Then...”

The unspoken order hung, thick with murderous intent.

**Chapter 962: Li Xi’s Peril**

Li Yu’s aura chilled Zhongxing to the bone. When the Young Master wore this look, blood would flow.

But survival trumped all. “It will be done!”

As Zhongxing scrambled out, Li Yu’s mind raced. Guan Yu’s allies had to be eliminated—starting with the ones enabling his financial strikes.

Yet unbeknownst to him, another storm brewed. Far from the guild’s halls, Li Xi—Li Yu’s younger sister—stood unaware of the crosshairs now settling upon her.

The true crisis was only beginning.
