“Now, Xue Jing felt exactly this way. Whenever she went out and saw any man other than Guan Yu, she found them all utterly detestable. Xiao Yu chuckled, ‘Well then, it seems I’ll have to spend more time with Zhao Yihe from now on. That way, you won’t have to follow me around constantly. Hehehe.’”

“You rascal, do you really hate having me around?” Xue Jing asked discontentedly, her small fist already aimed at Guan Yu’s head. A single careless word from him might earn him a punch.

Chapter 2363: Disagreement

Xue Jing now firmly believed that apart from Guan Yu, every other man she encountered outside seemed thoroughly loathsome. Xiao Yu grinned, “Splendid! Then I’ll make a point to socialize more with Zhao Yihe. That should free you from shadowing me all the time. Hehehe.”

“You scoundrel! Do you truly despise my company?” Xue Jing retorted irritably, her tiny fist poised threateningly near Guan Yu’s temple. A single misstep in his response could result in a knuckle sandwich.

Xue Jing’s threatening gesture amused Guan Yu. “It’s not that I dislike your company,” he clarified with a laugh, “but if you’re always clinging to me, how can I possibly sow wild oats elsewhere? Hehehe.”

“Shameless! Aren’t there enough women at home already? You’re still courting trouble? If you dare philander outside, I’ll inform everyone. They’ll exhaust you so thoroughly you won’t have energy left for escapades,” Xue Jing feigned indignation.

Though others might not voice it, Xue Jing remained Guan Yu’s staunchest ally. Having observed his behavior, she pressed, “How many women do you actually have outside?”

Guan Yu stiffened momentarily, surprised by her directness. However, Xue Jing—his most reliable confidante in Qiaoyuan District and comrade through life-and-death trials—deserved candor. With forced levity, he countered, “However many you imagine, that’s the number. What—are you conducting an inspection?”

“I’ve no patience for that. As merely one of your women, I’ve accepted my fate. All I ask is a corner of your heart. My true fear isn’t sharing you, but you being harmed or deceived.”

Xue Jing began rambling like a fretful grandmother. Guan Yu recognized the signs—she was about to launch into one of those political lectures taught by Xu Jinglei. The mere thought made him cringe.

“If I claimed no outside entanglements, would you believe me? Ling’er and Feng Xihu aren’t my women, right?” Guan Yu interjected hastily, preferring romantic speculation to ideological sermons.

“I don’t believe you. I never accused Ling’er or Feng Xihu. There are certainly others,” Xue Jing asserted confidently.

Perplexed, Guan Yu wondered—had Jin Hua been discovered? Had he left some clue? Thankfully, Xue Jing was loyal. If Yang Conghan learned of this...

“Why are you so certain?” he probed curiously.

Adopting a sage manner, Xue Jing explained, “Any normal man returning after days away would crave intimacy with his women. Yet you never do. This proves you’ve satisfied those urges elsewhere. Even surrounded by beauties at home, you show no hunger.”

“First I’ve heard of this theory! Do I truly appear so indifferent? I’ve never noticed,” Guan Yu evaded.

“As the woman waiting faithfully, how could I miss it? Sometimes when A-Mei washes your clothes, she detects an odd scent—like sandalwood incense. She confided this to me privately. I covered for you, claiming it’s sweat, though you’re naturally odorless. A-Mei’s easily fooled, but take care henceforth.”

Her tone implied she now held leverage. Pressing further, she asked, “Who is she? She must be stunningly beautiful with flawless pale skin—your standard criteria, correct?”

Guan Yu sighed resignedly. “Accurate. You know me too well.”

“Naturally. Moreover, she must possess unique qualities. The Qiaoyuan women already embody every virtue,” Xue Jing deduced triumphantly.

When Guan Yu nodded confirmation, she pressed, “Who is she? Can’t you share details?”

Though Xue Jing was his most trustworthy companion, Guan Yu deemed ignorance safer. Shaking his head, he replied, “Her identity is sensitive. Not that I mistrust you—fewer know, fewer risks. Understand?”

Xue Jing nodded sagely. “Perfectly. I trust you beyond my own parents. If secrecy is needed, I’ll inquire no further.”

Hesitating briefly, she changed tack. “Have you visited Jones recently? I hear she’s expanding her organization. You should check on her—she left everything for you. Don’t break her heart.”

“I know,” Guan Yu acknowledged. “Recent events overwhelmed me. This trip was for Uncle Qing, though futile. I planned to visit Jones afterward, but his passing derailed everything.”

“It’s not too late. Let’s visit her now—it’s been ages,” Xue Jing suggested. With ample daylight remaining and no pressing matters, Guan Yu approved.

As their car reached Qiaoyuan’s gates, Guan Yu prepared to divert toward Jones’s base—whether as her lover or faction leader, a visit was overdue.

“Wait! Stop!” Xue Jing suddenly cried. Braking abruptly, Guan Yu asked, “What’s wrong?”

Embarrassed, Xue Jing giggled, “We’re already home! If we’re visiting Jones, shouldn’t I change first?”

Chapter 2364: The Ill-Conceived Plan

Xue Jing chuckled apologetically, “Hehe, see? We’re right at our doorstep. Before visiting Jones, give me time to change?”

Guan Yu groaned. “You’ve worn that outfit mere hours! Why change?”

“Hours matter not! I want a fresh look. Visiting Jones’s organization demands formality. I need to redo my makeup too. Come inside with me first.” Xue Jing insisted—typical feminine vanity.

Exasperated, Guan Yu countered, “You rarely wear makeup! Change if you must—I’ll wait here.”

“No! You might flee alone. Come inside!” She pushed him urgently from the car.

Resigned, Guan Yu drove back. Lounging bored on the sofa, he endured thirty agonizing minutes before impatience struck. He resolved to consult Xu Jinglei about this chronic issue—such delays would drive him mad.

Zhang Han emerged in a Pikachu bathrobe, noting his irritation. “Big Brother, missing me already? Take me next time!”

“Absolutely not!” Guan Yu protested. “Stay home gaming. I’ll bring you for leisure outings, not errands.”

“Fine! Wait forever then!” She skipped upstairs cheekily.

Guan Yu wondered—were all Qiaoyuan women entering early menopause? Why this collective antagonism?

When Xue Jing finally emerged, Guan Yu bowed mockingly. “Thank heavens! I’d feared waiting till nightfall.”

“Barely an hour passed,” Xue Jing dismissed.

“Not an hour?” Guan Yu gaped. “Check the clock! You took eighty minutes!”

Xue Jing feigned innocence. “Eighty minutes isn’t an hour!”

Suppressing rage, Guan Yu gritted, “My mistake entirely. Let’s depart.”

Xue Jing had showered and changed into pristine white leisurewear complementing her porcelain skin, paired with black skate shoes elongating her legs. Even her mask coordinated. Guan Yu, too vexed to notice, seethed silently.

In the car, Xue Jing teased, “Truly angry? My Guan Yu isn’t so petty.”

“Merely contemplating solutions. If every outing demands such waits, I’ll go insane.”

Xue Jing giggled. “Two solutions exist. Hear them?”

“Enlighten me,” Guan Yu sighed, anticipating nonsense.

“First: Persuade the other women to let you roam solo. Then I won’t need to monitor you.”

“Useless! They’ll never agree. Second idea?”

“Second: Notify me beforehand. I’ll prepare earlier, reducing wait time.”

Guan Yu brightened. “Brilliant! I’ll inform you the night prior. A full night for primping should suffice, no? Hahaha!”

Xue Jing scowled at his mockery. “Fine! Suffer endless waits then!”

“Wait! Let’s discuss reasonably,” Guan Yu backpedaled.

Chapter 2365: Battle with the Sacred Beast

Entering the temple’s side chamber, Jiang Shan shattered the rusted lock with an energy pulse. He and Ji Qian stepped into fragrance-laden darkness, initially wary of toxins. Finding the aroma harmless, they advanced with torches.

Soon, a radiant object glowed ahead. “A treasure!” Jiang Shan exclaimed.

Examining the crystalline vessel emitting firefly-like radiance, they debated its nature—lamp? Container? Cautiously, Jiang Shan channeled energy toward it.

Ji Qian intervened. “Why destroy what we sought?”

Relenting, Jiang Shan grasped the artifact. Instantly, tremors shook the chamber. They fled moments before its collapse.

As dust settled, bestial roars approached. Ji Qian trembled while Jiang Shan strategized calmly. The sacred beast’s challenge had begun.
