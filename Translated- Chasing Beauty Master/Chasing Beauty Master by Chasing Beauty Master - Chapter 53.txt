Guan Yu turned his head with a faint smile, shaking his head in silent amusement. Though not deeply versed in legal matters, he clearly understood the concept of self-defense and his lack of liability. His current turmoil stemmed not from fear of consequences, but from the visceral reality of having taken human lives.

"Enough... Overthinking won't help," he murmured, pursing his lips before walking aside.

As the three robbers were being restrained by Feng Xin's subordinates and Liu Laoda's men, someone called the police. Settling into the car with Feng Xin to handle the aftermath, Guan Yu heard her whisper, "Let's go to the station first to clarify matters properly."

Despite the Fire Gang and Liu Laoda's considerable influence in NJ City, proper procedures had to be followed for a fatal incident occurring in public. After three hours of police interviews, Guan Yu, Feng Xin, and the old man emerged from the station after leaving their contact information.

"Guan Yu! In ancient times, a life debt required prostration to one's savior!" The old man interrupted Guan Yu's attempt to speak, producing a business card with both hands. "Remember this – whatever difficulty arises, call me. Even if it requires walking through blades or fire, I'll repay this debt with my last breath!"

"You honor me too much, sir." Guan Yu accepted the simple card bearing only a name and number with casual grace. "Till we meet again, Old Master Liu."

Separating from the Liu entourage, Guan Yu entered Feng Xin's car. "That old man commands such obedience from Liu Jun... he must be significant," Feng Xin remarked, eyeing Guan Yu.

"People make grand promises in the heat of moment. Once the adrenaline fades..." Guan Yu shrugged. "Liu Jun's no saint. His uncle's cut from the same cloth. Best not dwell on it."

Feng Xin chuckled. "You see through things clearly."

"How many truly remember favors forever?" Guan Yu raised an eyebrow philosophically.

Despite the day's dangers, their gains were substantial – the Speeder Gang's debt of hundreds of thousands was now resolved.

Watching them depart, Liu Jun grimaced before approaching his uncle. "Uncle, why risk associating with Fire Gang's people?"

"Risk?" The old man snapped. "Had they not arrived promptly, and that young man not intervened, I'd be full of bullet holes! Your tardy arrival speaks volumes!"

"But Uncle, we came as fast—"

"Enough! Take me home." The old man cut him off. When Liu Jun later mentioned Guan Yu's debt, his uncle exploded: "Twenty thousand? Absurd! Cancel it immediately!"

"Cancel?" Liu Jun gaped.

"Would you rather I pay?" The old man's glare made Liu Jun backpedal rapidly. "No! Of course not! Everything I have comes from your support!"

That night passed quietly. Next morning, Guan Yu called teacher Liu Shilei to extend his leave.

"You missed dinner! I worried all night!" came the reproachful voice. After lengthy explanations, he headed out to meet Speeder Gang leader Luo Cheng.

Outside the art school, Guan宇 observed passing students. Compared to the beauties like Feng Xin and Liu Shilei, even his ex Fu Linlin seemed ordinary now. A roaring motorcycle interrupted his musings – Luo Cheng arrived.

"Brother, I'll repay this somehow!" The leather-clad man gripped Guan Yu's hand. After retrieving the cash from bank, they rode to Liu Jun's entertainment complex.

In his lavish office, Liu Jun received them with uncharacteristic warmth. "Why trouble yourself? A call would've sufficed!" His forced joviality confused both visitors.

After persistent refusals, Liu Jun finally accepted principal 160,000 yuan, waiving interest. The released Speeder Gang member appeared bruised but relieved.

As they left, Liu Jun's subordinate questioned the leniency. "That kid's under Old Master Liu's protection," Liu Jun muttered, counting bills. "Better ten thousand lost than that old tiger's wrath."

Chapter 128: Liu Jun's Jealousy

Outside, Luo Cheng regarded Guan Yu with new respect. The debt resolution's ease revealed hidden connections. Meanwhile, Liu Jun stared at his wall-mounted tiger tapestry, grinding his teeth. "Lucky brat... How did he bewitch the old man?" The entertainment king's jealousy burned as his phone buzzed with incoming deals – life's intricate dance continued.
