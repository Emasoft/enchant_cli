"Alright, originally I hadn’t done anything wrong, but now even nothing has turned into something!"

* * *

"Get out of the car! I’ll handle it myself!"

* * *

**Chapter 847: Cramp?**

* * *

"Handle it myself?"

* * *

Guan Yu slightly lowered his head, his gaze involuntarily drifting towards Wen Yaxue’s fair thighs. To be precise, his eyes fixated on the area concealed by white cotton, glistening with moisture. He couldn’t help but recall the earlier intoxicating scene and swallowed hard.

* * *

This woman was truly fiery!

* * *

"Believe me, I’ll gouge your eyes out!" Wen Ya said coldly, her slightly clearer eyes gradually becoming hazy again.

* * *

Under Guan Yu’s unabashed stare, Wen Ya felt her body burning with desire yet seething with humiliation, viewing Guan Yu as a petty opportunist.

* * *

"Still not leaving?"

* * *

Wen Ya sensed her body slipping beyond her control again and shouted at Guan Yu.

* * *

If Guan Yu didn’t leave, would he watch her relieve herself with her own hands? Moreover, alone at night, who knew if he’d remain rational?

* * *

She didn’t trust him!

* * *

Guan Yu frowned. "This is my car. Why should I leave?"

* * *

He was irked by Wen Ya’s commanding attitude and her treating him like a pervert. After saving her from wolves, she showed no gratitude, only hostility.

* * *

"Y-you..."

* * *

Seeing Guan Yu unmoved, Wen Ya grew furious, convinced he was waiting for her aphrodisiac to take full effect.

* * *

He’d take advantage and escape responsibility afterward. A perfect plan, especially with her beauty!

* * *

Her body burned, her fair skin flushing as she writhed. "Ah... oh..."

* * *

Wen lay on the backseat, lost in pleasure, forgetting Guan Yu watched her. Guan Yu stared, mouth agape.

* * *

Her performance was pure seduction! Guan Yu’s blood boiled, torn between beast and restraint.

* * *

"Damn it! Why must I endure this torture?" he lamented.

* * *

As he struggled, Wen’s moans crescendoed. Her hands cramped mid-act, leaving her desperate.

* * *

"Guan Yu! Help me!" she begged, her voice sultry.

* * *

Guan Yu hesitated but succumbed. Their bodies entwined, passion overriding reason. The car rocked through the night.

* * *

**Chapter 848: A Real Experience**

* * *

Morning arrived. Wen awoke, disoriented. She’d dreamt of Guan Yu but found him beneath her, reality dawning.

* * *

"Y-you... last night..." she stammered.

* * *

"Everything you dreamed was real," Guan Yu confirmed.

* * *

"YOU BASTARD!" Wen attacked, hysterical. "HOW COULD YOU?!"

* * *

"You asked for help! Could we’ve stayed rational?" Guan Yu defended.

* * *

"YOU SHOULD’VE LEFT!" Wen screamed, tears welling. "COWARD!"

* * *

**Chapter 849: Aftermath**

* * *

Wen lunged, enraged. Guan Yu restrained her. "We’re not enemies! Must you hate me?"

* * *

"You ruined me!" Wen accused, voice breaking.

* * *

"Neither of us were in control," Guan Yu argued. "But I’ll take responsibility."

* * *

"Responsibility?" Wen scoffed. "You’re just another liar!"

* * *

Tears fell as she grappled with losing her purity. The truth shattered her—she and Guan Yu had shared a reckless night.

* * *

Silence lingered, heavy with regret and unresolved tension.
