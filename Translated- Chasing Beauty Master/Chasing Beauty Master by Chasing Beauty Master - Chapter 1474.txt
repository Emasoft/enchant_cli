“No.” Elder Lu objected. “Either you stop riding my horses, or you must bring them back safely. Don’t you know these are the two finest steeds from Qianhui Peak? They’re already an extinct breed—unobtainable in the markets. Qianhui Peak only has these two left, and they’re exceedingly difficult to raise. You absolutely cannot lose them!”

Guan Yu thought to himself that without these two exceptional horses, their journey would indeed be impossible. After all, relying solely on spiritual energy sword flight techniques for travel would be far too exhausting.

**Chapter 3842: Utterly Disgraced**

“Fine,” Guan Yu conceded. “Since you care so deeply about these horses, I’ll make sure to return them.” He turned to Wang Jun. “Let’s not delay. We should depart immediately.”

Wang Jun bowed to Elder Lu. “Thank you for your assistance, Elder Lu.”

Elder Lu smiled approvingly at Wang Jun, clearly pleased with the young man’s manners. “Here,” he said, handing Wang Jun a small coin pouch. “You rarely leave the mountain and likely carry little silver. Take this. When you descend, purchase anything useful you see.”

Though the pouch appeared smaller than the one previously given to Guan Yu, it still held a considerable amount. Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Elder Lu, must you play favorites? You’ve given Wang Jun silver—what about mine?”

“You?” Elder Lu scoffed. “Haven’t I given you enough already? Do you think the silver I’ve provided over your multiple excursions has vanished? Endless greed, you rascal!”

Guan Yu pouted. “Who complains about having too much silver?”

“Thank you for your generosity, Elder Lu.” Wang Jun bowed deeply. Even without the gift, he knew Guan Yu—ever the wealthy companion—would cover expenses. But he appreciated the gesture.

“No need for formalities,” Elder Lu waved. “Elder Mu could never afford such sums. Since you’re accompanying Guan Yu, you shouldn’t appear destitute.”

His tone grew serious. “Another matter requires your attention. With the Demon Sect’s recent movements still unclear, you must exercise extreme caution. Change into plain clothes immediately after descending. Disguises will aid your mission.”

“Understood. Thank you for the warning,” Wang Jun replied courteously. Guan Yu merely shrugged. “No need for such fuss! If Demon Sect lackeys come, I’ll slaughter them all. Nothing to fear.”

Elder Lu sighed. Guan Yu remained his usual reckless self, never taking anything seriously. The young man’s recent victory over Elder Xiang before countless disciples had skyrocketed his fame—not just within Yunqing Sect, but across the jianghu. Whispers spread of Guan Yu becoming Yunqing’s future leader.

Elder Xiang’s humiliation burned bitterly. His attempt to discipline Guan Yu without the Emperor’s Seal backfired spectacularly. Now injured and disgraced, he struggled to face his own disciples. Mocking rumors circulated: What restrictions would Elder Xiang impose next? Forbid weapons entirely? Demand bare-handed combat?

Each barb twisted the knife deeper. Consumed by hatred, Elder Xiang seethed. His failed plot with Yanzhao to eliminate Guan Yu in the desert now haunted him. With Yanzhao branded a traitor, he needed new allies against this rising threat.

**Westward Journey**

Mounting Elder Lu’s prized horses, Guan Yu and Wang Jun raced from Yunqing Sect toward Zhouji City—a legendary metropolis second only to the capital. Nestled in tropical foothills abundant with rare minerals and exotic flora, it attracted merchants and craftsmen despite steep prices.

Guan Yu sought materials for crafting crossbows. After a day’s hard ride, they reached an unfamiliar town as dusk approached.

“It’s past three. Let’s rest here,” Guan Yu declared, dismounting. Conversing with someone who understood modern timekeeping pleased him—unlike Wang Xiaorong’s endless questions.

Wang Jun agreed. The horses, astonishingly tireless despite the day’s sprint, deserved respite. “These steeds are remarkable,” he marveled.

As they walked the desolate streets, Wang Jun finally asked, “Guan Yu, what’s our true purpose here? Sightseeing?”

“You followed without knowing?” Guan Yu teased. “What if I’d brought you to die?”

**Chapter 3843: Partnership (Part 1)**

“You promised no life-risking! Just fetching items,” Wang Jun protested.

“We’re procuring materials for crossbow crafting,” Guan Yu explained.

“Crossbows?” Wang Jun’s eyes lit up, then dimmed. “But the technology here... Basic bows maybe, but intricate mechanisms?”

“Xuanming claims he’ll find skilled artisans. If they fail, I’ll build one myself. How hard can copying designs be?”

Wang Jun nodded. Ancient China had crossbows millennia ago—why not here? In this cultivation world, mundane arrows might falter, but enchanted crossbows could prove devastating. Guan Yu’s Desert Eagle already dominated battles; a potent crossbow would bolster their arsenal.

“Lend me your craftsmen later?” Wang Jun requested. “I want a custom design—compact yet powerful.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. Wang Jun’s military family background explained the interest. “Familiar with military crossbows?”

“Grew up dismantling them,” Wang Jun grinned. “I want something sleek and lethal.”

“Easy to say,” Guan Yu snorted. “Depends on the artisans’ skill.”

“Shouldn’t we verify their capabilities before shopping? What if materials go to waste?”

“Overthinker,” Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “Regret coming? Leave now.”

“No!” Wang Jun backtracked. “Just... thinking aloud.”

Guan Yu relented. “We’ll buy materials regardless. If artisans fail, I’ll craft them myself. They’ll improve with time.”

“You? Seriously?”

“Seen enough to mimic. Why else indulge Xuanming? He covets my Desert Eagle. A crossbow distraction might preserve it.”

Wang Jun chuckled. “Cultivators do lust after treasures like starved men eyeing feasts.”

**Strange Town**

The dilapidated town’s closed shops and hurried citizens puzzled them. Two shuttered inns deepened the mystery. A playing girl in an alley became their only hope.

Approaching the nine-year-old, Wang Jun smiled. “Little sister, why’s everything closed?”
