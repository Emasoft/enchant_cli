“Haha, Mr. Yin jests. As Qingtian mentioned earlier, I merely relied on the outburst of immortal artifacts. Sweeping through the Three Sacred Sects? That’s a joke I can’t afford. Regarding your younger brother’s matter, I must consult with the others. You’ll be notified once we reach a decision. Here’s my number. Farewell.” Guan Yu maintained his composure, though the Yin family’s probing had caught him off guard. He knew the Demonic Sects teemed with talents far beyond the three prominent figures—Ren Qiansha, Qingtian, and Lü Wu. Even this casually encountered Yin family member from the Yin Kui Sect’s leading clan displayed remarkable prowess. The pressure weighed heavily on him.

In the past, Guan Yu would never have let such provocation slide. But now, he truly lacked the inclination to engage.

“Demons running rampant in this age…” Left Azure Robe sighed softly. As Qingcheng Sect’s painstakingly groomed successor, her heart ached. The Demonic Sects’ recent advancements had undeniably surpassed the Righteous Path in every aspect.

Guan Yu smiled faintly. Matters of worldly concern rarely moved him. His opposition to the Demonic Sects stemmed from duty rather than passion.

Returning to headquarters, he found morale in tatters. The string of recent defeats shocked him—how had things deteriorated so drastically in his brief absence?

“Lin Dong, explain this situation.” Guan Yu frowned at the dispirited crowd. Even with Ye Qingfeng captured and Zhang Ziran critically wounded, such profound demoralization seemed excessive.

“Night raids these past few days. Flaws emerged in our defensive arrays, allowing Phantom Blade assassins to strike twice. Two Kunlun disciples perished, and a Jiuhua Mountain disciple suffered grave injuries.” Lin Dong wore a helpless expression. While he oversaw security, the faulty arrays fell beyond his expertise. The Kunlun array master tasked with repairs had been assassinated, leaving them vulnerable.

Guan Yu’s chest tightened. These assassins’ growing boldness endangered everyone—including Li Xi. While cultivators might survive ambushes, ordinary humans like her stood no chance.

“Take me to Zhang Ziran. Summon Li Xi—she’ll remain at my side henceforth. We’ll address the arrays later.” The admission stung—even he had limits. Array mechanics eluded him.

*Vajra, can you handle this?* Guan Yu queried internally, reluctant yet compelled to rely on his companion. Over-dependence risked weakness, but his brief cultivation journey left him little choice. Without Vajra’s ancient knowledge, confronting the Demonic Sects proved impossible.

“Naturally. Your replication talent simplifies many processes. Inspect the array with me later—fixed-location formations require minimal practice.” Vajra’s casual assurance unnerved Guan Yu. *Just how omnipotent is this diminutive spirit?*

“Since you’re so versatile, what of medical arts?” Guan pressed.

“Context-dependent. While the Demonic Emperor Sect’s heritage is familiar, not all their techniques can be countered.” Uncharacteristic solemnity colored Vajra’s reply when lives hung in balance.

Zhang Ziran’s blackened, swollen visage offered no clues. Guan Yu’s expression darkened.

“Crimson Emperor Fist from the Demonic Emperor Sect. Enter the consciousness sea—we’ll simulate countermeasures. Manageable.” Vajra diagnosed instantly.

“Senior Sister Zuo, was Brother Zhang struck by Qingtian’s Crimson Emperor Fist?” Guan Yu sought confirmation.

“Correct! White Cloud Temple’s medical arts live up to their reputation! Can he be saved?” Hope kindled in Zuo Qingyi’s eyes at Guan Yu’s swift diagnosis.

“The damage is superficial—internal organs remain intact. He suffers mainly from demonic toxins and energy seals. Three hours’ preparation suffices.” Guan Yu flushed at undeserved praise.

Three hours later, Zhang Ziran soaked in a medicinal tub as skeptical whispers swarmed outside:

“What if he fails? How do we explain to the sect master?”

“Under their roof, objections are futile. May Heaven favor our Young Master.” A narrow-eyed Daoist glared at the treatment chamber.

**Chapter 1182: Ambush and Traitors**

“What explanation does Longhu Mountain require?” Emerging pale but composed, Guan Yu’s gaze froze the muttering Daoist. The man quailed not from cultivation disparity, but the younger man’s aura of authority.

“My friend’s safety is assured without your concern. Retrieve him shortly and administer this pill. Full recovery in three days.” Tossing a porcelain vial to the loudest complainer, Guan Yu departed.

“Lin Dong, take me to Kunlun’s quarters. Fetch the array schematics.” Guan Yu scoffed at their incompetence—adept at shifting blame, helpless in crisis. Even immortal sects weren’t immune to decay.

Approaching Kunlun’s lodgings, hostile gazes met him:

“Come to mock us?”

“I propose alternatives: wallow here, or reclaim honor through vengeance?” Cold smiles accompanied his challenge.

“We’ll follow you.” After tense deliberation, the Kunlun disciples relented.

Midnight’s stillness cloaked the base. Outside, shadows whispered:

“Target tonight? Longhu Mountain? Jiuhua?”

“Kunlun—strike while they’re vulnerable.”

“Again? They’ll expect—”

“Precisely why they won’t.”

The lead assassin vanished mid-chuckle. Moments later, daggers pierced empty bedding.

“Leaving so soon?” Guan Yu’s languid voice shattered illusions as crimson light ensnared nine figures.

“Nine catches. Dispose of them as you will.” Guan Yu addressed the Kunlun disciples. “Remember—divided, we share your comrades’ fate.”

“Kunlun pledges obedience until this operation concludes.” Qingming’s bow signaled reluctant acceptance.

Later, Guan Yu’s expression hardened. Tonight’s success confirmed his suspicions—traitors enabled the precision strikes.

“Phantom Blade couldn’t pinpoint array flaws without insider help. Jiuhua’s defenses should’ve repelled them.”

“Found the rat—fluorescent powder marked weaknesses.” Lin Dong reported coldly.

“Let their own sects execute them. Convene all leaders in thirty minutes.”

As Lin Dong marveled at restored order, Guan Yu contemplated the deeper rot—sectarian pride blinding allies to shared peril. Only united could they withstand the Demonic Sects’ onslaught. Tonight’s victory was but the first step.
