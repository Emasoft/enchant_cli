Guan Yu immediately noticed the soporific incense in the air had grown significantly thicker. "So this is the trick," he realized. The female thief must have already come through here. But where could she be now?

A faint creak of a door echoed from downstairs. Without needing to look, Guan Yu's instincts flared—she had entered the surveillance room.

From that vantage point, one could monitor the entire corridor. Not wanting to be spotted, Guan Yu leapt into the air and wrapped his arms around a pillar, concealing himself from the cameras.

Before long, the thief emerged from the surveillance room, locking the door with a key. Guan Yu watched every move clearly. To his surprise, she possessed a full set of keys to the villa.

The entire mansion now reeked of soporific incense. Everyone else must have already succumbed to its effects.

The thief remained vigilant even after locking the door. Instead of moving immediately, she swiveled her head to scan her surroundings. Guan Yu's heart sank—she wore night-vision goggles. If this continued, she'd detect him.

With no alternative, Guan Yu chose to strike first. In the blink of an eye, he materialized before her, reaching to snatch the cloth mask from her face.

Yet her reflexes proved extraordinary. As she jerked her head back, silver needles shot from her mouth like hidden projectiles. Prepared, Guan Yu sidestepped the attack while grabbing her waistband to yank down her pants. The thief gasped in shock at his audacious move.

**Chapter 1953: So It Was You**

As the thief clutched her waistband in panic, Guan Yu seized the moment to rip off her mask.

“Just as I suspected,” he coldly declared. “Jinhua. What’s your purpose here?”

The revealed face confirmed his suspicion, but Jinhua offered no answer. Instead, she recoiled and hurled an egg-sized object at him.

Guan Yu instantly summoned a protective barrier resembling an eggshell. *Thud!* The small explosion released thick smoke. When it cleared, Jinhua had vanished, leaving only the villa’s front door swaying faintly.

“She escaped again,” Guan Yu muttered, shaking his head. At least her identity was now exposed. The commotion hadn’t roused the sleeping women—the soporific incense still permeated every corner.

**Chapter 1954: The New Manager**

The next morning, Guan Yu rose early to brew antidote in the kitchen. Knowing the women would wake with splitting headaches like Zhang Han’s previous experience, he prepared remedies in advance.

Yang Conghan emerged first, clutching her temples. Her eyes widened at the sight of her once-pristine white floors and sofa now streaked with grimy residue from Jinhua’s smoke bomb.

“Drink this,” Guan Yu gestured to bowls of broth-like liquid on the coffee table.

“What happened?” Yang mumbled, her words sluggish.

“Jinhua paid us a visit last night with her soporific incense.”

“Jinhua? The thief?” Yang’s sharp mind connected the dots instantly. “Impossible! She’s been by my side for years. How could I miss her skills?”

Guan Yu rubbed his nose ruefully. Her bone-contraction technique had been masterful—a worthy opponent indeed.

As others awoke and joined the cleanup, Zhang Han exclaimed, “Jinhua wanted to harm *me*?” The revelation spread quickly, prompting Guan Yu to inform Patriarch Yang.

“Jinhua targeting Hanhan too?” Yang Cheng’s voice held curiosity. “The situation grows complex. For her safety, Hanhan must return to the Yang estate immediately.”

Zhang Han protested, “I’ll die of boredom there with two old men!”

“Better bored than dead,” Lan Yu retorted.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei reported that Zhang Taiping and Liu Shuowei faced criminal charges. Guan Yu redirected him: “Investigate Jinhua. She’s a dangerous异能者 (supernatural being).”

**Chapter 1955: Signing the Contract**

At Night Blossom Club, Guan Yu introduced Qing Linger to Yang Conghan. The club owner’s eyes narrowed at the ethereal beauty.

“A medical student as our finance manager?” Yang’s tone dripped skepticism.

“She helped me expose hospital corruption,” Guan Yu explained. “Trustworthy.”

Yang relented. “Fine. Ten thousand monthly, bonuses based on performance.”

Qing Linger gasped at the sum—ten times her hospital stipend. “I...I’ll do my best!”

As Guan Yu showed her around,侯金顺 (Hou Jinshun) greeted them warmly. On the third floor, Yang’s office reflected her conflicted feelings—another stunning woman entering Guan Yu’s orbit.

Qing Linger trembled before Yang’s legendary beauty. “Sh-she’s like a painting...”

Yang cut through the tension: “Let’s see your contract.” The paperwork began, but unspoken currents swirled—about trust, hidden agendas, and the mysterious Jinhua still at large.
