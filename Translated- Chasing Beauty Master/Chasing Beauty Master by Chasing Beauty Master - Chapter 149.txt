Chapter 366: Sworn Brotherhood

Guan Yu confiscated the entire pack of cigarettes from Little Dot's hands. Big Dragon watched with pained expressions – those were his long-hoarded treasures, now all taken away by Guan Yu.

Xiao Xiong spoke first: "You're really going after the top dog tomorrow?"

Tilting his head against the bed frame, Guan Yu declared firmly: "Since he dared touch my brother, he should be prepared for retaliation."

"I'm curious about your identity," Xiao Xiong said slowly, taking a drag from his cigarette.

"Likewise," Guan Yu countered without answering. "How did someone who commands storms in the underworld end up here so easily?"

Xiao Xiong smiled bitterly. "Truly want to know?"

"Enlighten me," Guan Yu nodded.

Glancing at the night outside the window, Xiao Xiong took a deep drag that burned the cigarette down to its filter. Stubbing it underfoot, he said: "Still early. Since you're not sleeping, let's talk."

Watching Xiao Xiong's unrestrained smoking, Guan Yu grimaced: "You call this early? At least smoke slower." He handed over another cigarette and lit it personally.

Xiao Xiong rolled his eyes before inhaling. "Commoners shouldn't fight officials. Even a underworld kingpin can't withstand political power. I beat up the provincial governor's son. That's why I'm here." A wry smile twisted his lips.

"Just that simple?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Just that simple."

"There must be more to it."

Xiao Xiong ignored Guan Yu's pained expression, taking another fierce drag. "He stole my girlfriend."

Guan Yu choked on his smoke, coughing violently. After ensuring they hadn't disturbed others, he stared incredulously: "What? With your wealth and power, why would she leave?"

Realizing his blunder, Guan Yu hastily added: "Sorry, I didn't mean she's materialistic—"

Cutting him off, Xiao Xiong laughed bitterly: "You're not wrong. Her ambitions weren't just financial. She's a beautiful civil servant. Would you choose the straight path or the crooked one for your future?"

Guan Yu's words died in his throat. His own first love had similarly abandoned him for ambition. But where he'd traded one flower for a garden, Xiao Xiong got handcuffs.

"Was it worth it?"

Xiao Xiong nodded then shook his head. The memories of real love remained, at least.

Activating his detection system covertly, Guan Yu fell silent. Xiao Xiong's suffering dwarfed his own. They sat smoking quietly until Guan Yu asked: "Why tell me this?"

"Righteous men are rare. You remind me of my old brothers-in-arms." Xiao Xiong's voice thickened. "Before prison claims me completely... would you be my sworn brother?"

Xiao Xiong's cigarette froze mid-air. Meeting Guan Yu's earnest gaze, he suddenly roared with laughter, uncaring of awakened inmates: "If Young Master Guan doesn't scorn this Xiao Xiong!"

Their commotion drew irritated glances that quickly turned fearful – one the new cell leader, the other an underworld legend. Even Big Dragon watched meaningfully before feigning sleep.

Kneeling before two upright cigarettes serving as incense, they chanted in unison: "I, Guan Yu/Xiao Xiong, hereby swear brotherhood. Life and death shall not part us!"

Coughing violently after inhaling entire cigarettes in single drags, they laughed through teary eyes.

"Meeting you before imprisonment..." Xiao Xiong's smile turned wistful.

Guan Yu gripped his shoulder: "I'll get you out."

Xiao Xiong chuckled dismissively: "If you manage that, my entire L City empire is yours." Their conversation shattered by sudden crashes from Cell 335.

"FUCKING INSOMNIAC ASSHOLES!" roared the top dog – now pinned under collapsed bedding, wheezing from Niu Le's devastating punch.

Guan Yu and Xiao Xiong exchanged amused glances as chaos erupted.

Chapter 367: Brothers Reunited

Guan Yu grinned at Xiao Xiong's astonishment: "That's his style." Indeed, Niu Le had returned fiercer after his leg injury – the very reason for Guan Yu's pride.

Xiao Xiong marveled: "Your brother's an indestructible cockroach."

As guards intervened, Niu Le straddled his bloodied foe, fists raining down until electric prods separated them. Both men bore gruesome injuries – Niu Le's knee swollen black-purple, the top dog's face pulped beyond recognition.

"Lucky today," Niu Le spat bloody phlegm at his opponent. "But luck runs out."

Xiao Xiong observed: "Your brother's ferocity cowed them all."

At dawn, Guan Yu watched Niu Le limp back to Cell 334. Their eyes met through bars.

"Brother! Didn't know you were next door!" Niu Le's gruff voice boomed before guards shoved him along.

During yard time, Guan Yu's group confronted the battered top dog. Unseen by all, a venomous snake slithered from the fat man's palm into Niu Le's clothes.

Chapter 368: Niu Le's Peril

As the sworn brothers reunited in the yard, Guan Yu's detection system flared with warning. Xiao Xiong's eyes widened seeing Guan Yu diagnose Niu Le's shattered knee through mere glance.

"Two days," Guan Yu promised. "You'll walk normally."

Xiao Xiong stared incredulously: "You can truly heal this?"

Before Guan Yu could answer, the lurking viper struck.
