Regarding Princess Jiang Xin’s status, it would be difficult for her to marry a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect, as the imperial court would likely forbid and disapprove of such a union. However, given Wan Hong’s capabilities, he was destined to become a formidable figure who would eventually transcend his identity as a mere sect disciple.

Upon reflection, he indeed seemed a suitable match for Jiang Xin. Such an exceptional youth was a rarity even in a millennium—upright, magnanimous, and prudent in handling affairs. He was unquestionably superior to that Chu Fan in every regard.

Jiang Yuankai added, “Brother Wan Hong, as you can see, Her Highness the Princess Dowager favors this idea. What are your thoughts?”

Guanyu smiled wryly before rising to bow respectfully. “Brother Jiang, Your Highness—your exalted statuses are beyond my reach. The young mistress is a beloved princess doted upon by His Majesty. As a mere commoner, I am utterly unworthy. Thus, this matter is impossible. I harbor no delusions.”

“I show you such esteem, yet you refuse without hesitation? How peculiar,” the Princess Dowager remarked curiously.

For anyone else, receiving such an offer from Her Highness would leave them speechless with joy, unable to voice the slightest objection. Once, during a banquet, when she had casually suggested matching Qin Huan of the Qin family with Jiang Xin in the young lord’s presence, Qin Huan had nearly leapt for excitement, barely restraining himself from kowtowing in gratitude.

Such an offer was universally irresistible—yet here was Wan Hong rejecting it outright. This unprecedented refusal left the Princess Dowager astonished.

“Brother Wan Hong, might you reconsider? There’s no need for an immediate answer,” Jiang Yuankai urged. This marked the first time he had ever made such an overture; usually, others pleaded with him regarding Jiang Xin’s affairs.

“I am deeply honored by Your Highness and Brother Jiang’s regard, but I remain unworthy. Moreover, as a lowborn man, I doubt the young mistress would look favorably upon me,” Guanyu replied with a pained smile.

“Are you certain?” The Princess Dowager’s displeasure surfaced. She found Wan Hong’s arrogance galling—her favor was an honor, yet he spurned it ungratefully. Though she knew those who cultivated both magic and martial arts held boundless potential...

**Chapter 4814: The Pretext**

...this very potential had motivated her consideration. Moreover, this was the first time she had ever initiated such a proposal. Typically, noble matrons sought her with endless pretexts to arrange marriages, all of which she rejected—politely or firmly. Yet her unprecedented overture now met immediate refusal.

“Why?” The Princess Dowager demanded sharply, her anger palpable. Three simple words demanded justification—failure to satisfy her would see him banished from the estate forever.

Guanyu wrestled for an excuse. Though he admired Jiang Xin, her bond with Chu Fan commanded respect. He refused to disrupt their relationship through underhanded means. Moreover, with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi soon arriving, adding Jiang Xin to his tangled affections seemed unwise.

Most crucially, wedding Jiang Xin would shackle him—he’d have to abandon his Cloud Azure Sect identity to match her imperial status. The Princess Dowager might impulsively demand immediate marriage, burdening him with unwanted obligations. Thus, refusal was necessary.

“In truth, I am already betrothed,” Guanyu declared with feigned sincerity. “I cannot wrong the young mistress through such disparity in status, nor betray my fiancée—though she pales in comparison to Lady Jiang.”

This pretext shifted the Princess Dowager’s perspective. Jiang Yuankai nodded approvingly, impressed by Wan Hong’s resolve—a man devoted to love could not be dishonorable.

“This excuse pleases me,” the Princess Dowager sighed. “So the young master’s heart is already claimed. Modern gallants forget their mothers at the sight of beauty—your fidelity makes you exceptional indeed.”

“Brother Wan Hong’s generosity and loyalty reflect his noble character,” Jiang Yuankai added. “It’s my honor to know such a man.”

“You flatter me, Brother Jiang. As a revered hero and imperial consort, your acquaintance is my fortune,” Guanyu demurred.

“Yet I feel my Xiner loses in this,” the Princess Dowager interjected cryptically. “How can you rejoice, husband? That Chu Fan cannot compare to Master Wan Hong—his conduct lacks nobility, his only skill singing operas for dotards. No future prospects! Yet our Xiner clings to him while this paragon slips away. Finding another dual cultivator is impossible!”

Guanyu now understood—the Princess Dowager valued his power above all. Her vision was shrewd, yet Jiang Xin’s status and existing bond made acceptance untenable.

Jiang Yuankai smiled. “Another dual cultivator is unthinkable. Yet if Chu Fan proves himself, he remains suitable—kind-hearted, devoted, and righteous despite humble origins.”

“You men understand nothing!” the Princess Dowager retorted. “Shall our daughter wed a mere actor? The entire realm would mock us! Kyoto teems with worthy suitors—Chu Fan deserves no consideration! Were it not for Xiner’s stubbornness, I’d have dismissed him long ago!”

With that, she departed, weary of debate. Jiang Yuankai always defended Chu Fan—a baffling stance she attributed to foolishness.

**Chapter 4815: Declining Favors**

After her exit, Jiang Yuankai sighed. “Pay no mind to women’s fancies, brother. Forgive this spectacle.”

“It’s natural for parents to desire powerful matches,” Guanyu conceded. “Yet I share your view—Lady Jiang and Chu Fan’s steadfast love commands respect. Despite the Princess Dowager’s oppression, Chu Fan perseveres. His constancy mirrors Lady Jiang’s spirited nature—they complement each other.”

Jiang Yuankai nodded thoughtfully. Though Chu Fan’s lowly status remained problematic, his recent efforts showed promise.

“Your insight shames this old man,” Jiang Yuankai admitted. “Should you ever need aid, call upon me without hesitation.”

Guanyu declined dinner invitations, wary of encountering the resentful Jiang Xin. This refusal further intrigued Jiang Yuankai—commoners clamored for such honors, yet Wan Hong spurned them without avarice or pride.

**Chapter 4816: Curtain Rise**

Departing the estate, Guanyu headed to Scarlet Charm Theater, foregoing supper. The venue overflowed—every seat and aisle packed, save the central VIP box reserved for Jiang Xin.

Backstage, a face-painted Chu Fan approached. “Brother Wan Hong, I heard a maid summoned you. Any news of Lady Jiang?”

“Marquis Jiang fears the influx of mercenaries coveting the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl,” Guanyu explained. “For her safety, she must remain sequestered.”

Chu Fan accepted this gracefully. “Her security comes first.”

As the performance commenced, the stage glittered with enchanted gems and shielded candles, illuminating actors while shrouding the audience—a clever balance of light and shadow. Guanyu lingered unseen at the wings, observing the bustling preparations. Above, Jiang Xin’s empty box loomed—a silent testament to star-crossed affections.
