Xuan Ming had not anticipated this fellow to be so willful. It seemed subduing it would require patience. With ample time at hand and the Dragon Eye Amber in his possession, he resolved to gradually influence the artifact spirit through repeated mental conditioning during his visits, convinced eventual success was inevitable.

“Very well,” Xuan Ming said, “Since you insist on your ways, I shall take my leave. Until we meet again.” He turned to depart.

The artifact spirit, however, abruptly shifted its temperament. Though moments ago it had nearly expelled Xuan Ming in anger, the prospect of his voluntary departure now provoked its capricious nature. “You presume to come and go as you please?” it thundered. “This realm obeys my will alone!”

“If you boast such prowess,” Xuan Ming retorted, “prove it today.” The artifact spirit surged forward, poised to attack. Xuan Ming grimaced, acutely aware of his disadvantage—a mere wisp of soul consciousness in another’s domain.

“We bear no enmity. Must violence be our first recourse?” he protested, but the spirit had already unleashed a spell.

To Xuan Ming’s astonishment, the spirit conjured spell after spell without pause, its attacks cascading relentlessly. Even his true body could not withstand such ferocity in this alien space. Survival demanded retreat before his soul suffered irreparable harm.

Yet escape proved impossible—the spirit had sealed all exits. Desperate, Xuan Ming spread his arms in surrender. “Strike then. I cannot prevail.”

Two spells struck, searing his soul. The external Xuan Ming coughed blood as his consciousness reeled. Recognizing futility, he ceased resistance. “Killing me gains you nothing,” he gasped.

True to his words, the spirit halted. “How tedious,” it sneered. “Too clever to fight hopeless battles, yet lacking all mettle. Dull.” With that, it vanished.

Xuan Ming awoke as though from days of labor, soul-weary and weakened. “This spirit’s power matches Guan Yu’s warnings,” he murmured. “But aligning its will remains thorny. Patience is needed... For now, rest.”

Soul injuries demanded careful convalescence. Neglect risked lasting scars, as evidenced by the Demon Lord’s unresolved afflictions from past recklessness.

Guan Yu and Wang Jun returned to their quarters, barely containing their glee. “Well? Worth the trade?” Guan Yu grinned.

“You gained a haul,” Wang Jun grumbled. “I got but one item.”

“Ungrateful! Shall we return the Dragon Eye Amber? What use is it to you—a mere trinket?”

“It was my find!” Wang Jun retorted. “A rare treasure! You trade my prize for baubles and dare boast?”

“All for your benefit,” Guan Yu chuckled, scratching his head. Wang Jun proved harder to dupe than expected. “Take these materials to Elder Wang—have him forge crossbow bolts.”

**Chapter 4723: Discovering the Treasure**

Wang Jun gaped at the hidden chamber. “A treasure vault?” How had Guan Yu concealed this trove? He burned to inquire but held his tongue as Guan Yu seemed preoccupied.

“Stay hidden here,” Guan Yu ordered. “Be seen by none.”

Nodding, Wang Jun complied. Yet stepping into the outer vault left him breathless—a mountain of gold and silver ingots glittered beside heaped jewels. Pearl necklaces, gem-encrusted bracelets, and luminous orbs lay scattered like discarded pebbles.

“Is this... real?” Wang Jun whispered.

“Take what you wish,” Guan Yu said offhandedly. “But mind your greed.”

Ecstatic, Wang Jun lamented lacking sacks or carts. He bypassed bulky ingots for rarities—a resplendent Night Pearl caught his eye, its hues shifting from gold to azure within a filigreed gold cage.

Guan Yu snatched it abruptly. “This suits a gift.”

“For whom?” Wang Jun demanded, but Guan Yu departed without answer.

Vowing secrecy, Wang Jun resumed digging. Deeper layers promised greater treasures until a rumble startled him—Guan Yu had opened a stone door using the Wujian Villa’s command token.

“Stay,” Guan Yu instructed before exiting. Though uneasy alone, Wang Jun embraced his fortune, scouring the hoard with renewed zeal.

**Chapter 4724: Authority**

Guan Yu emerged to summon the villa’s disciples. Three elders marshaled the crowd into the central plaza, where he stood imposingly, robes billowing.

The villa’s core lay nestled in mountain caverns housing the treasure vaults. Guan Yu intended to appoint Du Teng as steward, distrusting the elders’ unspoken doubts.

“Report,” he commanded, twirling the villa’s token.

Elder He stepped forth. “Since your retreat, challengers have grown bolder—likely orchestrated. We repel them, yet their motives elude us.”

“Root out the instigators,” Guan Yu ordered. “Wujian Villa shuns conflict but fears none. Show no mercy to trespassers.”

“Shall you resume accepting duels?” Elder He pressed. “The villa’s reputation...”

Guan Yu hesitated. The original Wujian Immortal’s combative nature might contrast his caution. “First resolve this nuisance,” he decreed. “Conceal my return.”

Elder He frowned. “This... differs from your former temperament.”

Guan Yu’s aura erupted—a crushing wave of Boundary Sovereign power. “Question me again?”

“The Villa Master’s wisdom prevails!” the crowd chorused, cowed.

Satisfied, Guan Yu reined in his energy. “Prepare. Challenges resume once I conclude personal affairs.”

His display cemented authority—essential for governing the villa’s restless elements.
