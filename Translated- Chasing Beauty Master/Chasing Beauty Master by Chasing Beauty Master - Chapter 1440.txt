The wolf pup was Xiaoqi. After being captured by the Left Envoy and brought here, he had been immediately locked in this iron cage. Overwhelmed by fear, he had transformed into his wolf form.

Crouching warily in the cage, he watched Wang Xiaorong outside. Though this older sister seemed quite beautiful, he couldn’t fathom her intentions.

“Little fox,” Wang Xiaorong asked, “I have a question. Have you seen someone named Guan Yu? How is he now?”

The small fox, however, showed no interest in responding. It lowered its head and lay motionless, appearing utterly listless.

Suddenly, Wang Xiaorong had an idea—the creature must be hungry. If she offered food, it would surely comply.

The Left Envoy approached and cautioned, “Young Mistress, I must remind you: this young wolf demon is still useful to us. Don’t play with him to death.”

“Brother Left Envoy, don’t worry. Such a cute wolf demon—how could I let him die? Nothing will happen,” Wang Xiaorong replied cheerfully. Her current teasing aimed to extract information about Guan Yu, but this stubborn wolf pup proved unusually resistant.

When Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi arrived at the old farmer’s doorstep, Yan Zhao emerged from inside just as they were about to enter.

**Chapter 3,747: A Long-Awaited Meeting**

Xiao Zhi exclaimed, “Eldest Brother! You’re back! I’ve been worried sick! Where have you been these past days?”

“Are you both unharmed? I’ve been searching everywhere for you,” Yan Zhao said. His appearance now perfectly resembled their eldest brother, with no traces left from the blood toxin’s outbreak. Even the faint remnants of black fur on his face had been meticulously shaved off with a dagger.

“Guan Yu, you’re awake too? That’s excellent news.” Yan Zhao smiled at Guan Yu while closely observing his expression.

“Thank you for your concern. Rest assured, I’m not dead yet,” Guan Yu retorted irritably. “What happened that day? How did that black-furred monster abduct me?”

Guan Yu was testing Yan Zhao. If he truly were the shapeshifting monster, extreme caution would be necessary moving forward.

“I’m not entirely sure. After everyone had retired, a black-furred creature suddenly appeared, killed the old couple, and I gave chase. It escaped despite my pursuit. When I returned, you were gone. Fearing for your safety, I searched again but found nothing. I even scoured the bamboo grove but discovered neither Xiao Zhi nor the Celestial Physician’s dwelling, so I returned here to wait.”

Xiao Zhi explained, “The Celestial Physician’s residence is shielded by magic. Ordinary people can’t enter unless they detect the barrier.”

“So that’s why I couldn’t find it despite combing the entire grove,” Yan Zhao nodded.

Guan Yu deemed Yan Zhao’s explanation barely acceptable for now. Without evidence, even Xiao Zhi wouldn’t believe outright accusations.

Xiao Zhi proposed, “I think we should continue toward the desert. Our sect’s mission must take priority, and locating the elusive Miao City will require time.”

“Agreed. If you’re both ready, let’s depart immediately,” Yan Zhao said.

**Inside the Soul Demon Sect**
Unable to sleep, Wang Xiaorong fretted over Guan Yu’s safety. The Left Envoy’s report of his injuries only heightened her anxiety. Tossing in bed, she resolved to sneak out in nightclothes to confirm his condition.

Assuming the Demon Lord had retired, she gently pushed her door open—only to freeze at his voice: “Rong’er, where are you going?”

“Father... I just want to check on Guan Yu. They say he’s injured. Please let me go!”

The Demon Lord sighed. “The Left Envoy’s tales mislead you. Guan Yu, a dual cultivator of demonic and martial arts, wouldn’t fall easily. His ailment stems from internal discord with the Eight-Sided Drum Technique—proof he hasn’t fully mastered it.”

“Moreover, as our sect’s Young Mistress, how would it appear if you’re seen sneaking to meet a Cloud Azure disciple? Have dignity.”

“Father, I’ll stay hidden! Just a glimpse to ease my mind!” she pleaded, deploying her most winsome tone.

The Demon Lord’s expression hardened. “Rong’er, you know the Eight-Sided Drum Technique is pivotal to my plans. Why aid a Cloud Azure disciple? Bring him here instead!”

“He’ll never come!” she stamped her foot. “If Cloud Azure discovers his presence here, they’ll punish him! Can you guarantee no spies lurk among us?”

“Enough. You shan’t go. However...” he relented slightly, “I have another task for you tomorrow.”

Her eyes lit up—any external mission meant freedom to find Guan Yu.

“Don’t rejoice yet. Tomorrow, a guest arrives. If he stays, you may leave.”

With that, he departed, leaving her fuming. “Lies! Just another trick to cage me!”

**Chapter 3,748: No Beating Around the Bush**

At dawn, the Demon Lord sipped tea as a subordinate announced: “My Lord, a man named Santou demands audience.”

“Escort him here politely. Don’t frighten him off.”

Soon, a white-robed Santou approached. The Demon Lord rose with a smile. “The renowned triple-headed physician! I’ve long admired your skills. Let’s discuss—”

“Release my kin first,” Santou coldly interrupted.

“Patience.” The Demon Lord gestured to a guard. “Free the old wolf patriarch.” Turning back, he pressed, “Sit. Let’s talk terms.”

Santou reluctantly complied. “Speak plainly. Why harass my kin to summon me?”

“Our sect lacks a skilled healer since Lady Hu’s demise. I want you to replace her.”

“And if I refuse?”

The Demon Lord’s smile didn’t waver. “Your mother often brought you here as a child. We’re practically family. As your uncle, I ask this favor.”

Santou’s jaw tightened. Memories surfaced—his mother’s death at Red Lotus Sect’s hands, his powerlessness against entire sects.

“Consider your pup, Xiaoqi,” the Demon Lord pressed. “Here, he’ll thrive. Refuse, and your entire pack suffers.”

Santou closed his eyes. The choice was clear. “I’ll stay... on two conditions: Xiaoqi and the patriarch come freely, and I refuse immoral tasks.”

**Chapter 3,749: Duty Fulfilled**

The Demon Lord spread his hands. “Naturally. Welcome to Soul Demon Sect.”

As Santou nodded grimly, Wang Xiaorong watched from shadows, mind already crafting escape plans. Somewhere beyond these walls, Guan Yu’s fate—and her own—hung in the balance of drums and demons.
