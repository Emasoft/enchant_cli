Guan Yu thought he might as well randomly choose a cord. This small golden flower didn’t seem suited for a metal chain—it would look unattractive. As long as he brought this little flower back, he believed Siqi would surely like it. He might as well pick any cord.

While Guan Yu was still hesitating, the shopkeeper seemed to recall something. “Young Master, please wait a moment. I remember there’s an excellent chain. If you like it, I can sell it to you.”

As he spoke, the shopkeeper walked to the innermost part of the store, rummaged for a while, and retrieved a wooden box. The box clearly had seen many years, revealing how aged the items in this shop truly were.

Guan Yu grew curious. Could this wooden box contain a chain? The shopkeeper approached, opened the box, and Guan Yu saw something vaguely familiar inside.

“A Ghost Butterfly Token?” Guan Yu exclaimed in surprise. He recognized this object—he had seen it before with Wang Xiaorong. This was the very Ghost Butterfly Token she once carried, unmistakably an artifact of the Demon Soul Sect.

“Oh? Young Master, you recognize this?” The shopkeeper curiously picked up the token and asked.

Guan Yu held it in his hand, examining it carefully. It was identical to Wang Xiaorong’s Ghost Butterfly Token—the material felt the same, though he couldn’t identify the metal. Embossed with a skull flanked by butterfly wings, it earned its name.

He vividly recalled Wang Xiaorong telling him that only two Ghost Butterfly Tokens existed in the sect: one she possessed, the other with the Demon Sovereign. These tokens represented the highest authority in the sect, equivalent to the Demon Sovereign’s own status.

“Shopkeeper, where did you obtain this?” Guan Yu inquired, refusing to let go of the token after confirming its authenticity.

“I’m not entirely sure, Young Master. Do you know what this is?” The shopkeeper continued, “This item was left by my grandfather. It’s been tossed aside for years, untouched. I never knew its purpose—just treated it as a piece of metal. But sensing its uniqueness, I kept it all this time.”

“To be honest, I often played with this as a child—it was my toy.” The shopkeeper chuckled. “There’s a fine chain attached. Since you’re here today, I’ve decided to gift you this chain to fasten the golden flower. It’ll look splendid.”

This further convinced Guan Yu of the token’s authenticity. Its age suggested it couldn’t be counterfeit, and the shopkeeper’s account of its durable, unblemished metal—despite decades of handling—proved its extraordinary nature.

Guan Yu said, “This item strikes me as peculiar yet fascinating. Could I purchase it?”

“Young Master, you jest. This worthless trinket is merely a memento. Otherwise, I’d have discarded it long ago. Who would buy such a thing?”

The shopkeeper added, “I can give you the chain attached to it. Do you like it?”

“I do—not just the chain, but this token as well. It feels special. If possible, name your price. I wish to buy it,” Guan Yu pressed.

Noticing the shopkeeper’s hesitation—clueless about the token’s value yet sentimentally attached to his childhood toy—Guan Yu persisted.

“Young Master, you’ve bought two accessories today and been most generous. In return, I’ll gift you this token. For the jade lion and golden flower, 180 taels in total. How does that sound?” Ultimately, the shopkeeper decided to give the token freely, deeming it worthless.

Pleased, Guan Yu nodded. This shopkeeper was decent—unlike others who inflated prices upon seeing a customer’s interest. Receiving the token as a gift satisfied him greatly.

“Agreed.” Guan Yu produced the money pouch Lin Chen had given him. “Here’s 200 taels. Keep the change. I’m in a good mood today.”

“Ah, Young Master, your generosity astounds!” The shopkeeper’s eyes sparkled at the silver—a merchant’s delight.

After counting the exact 200 taels, the shopkeeper grinned. “Thank you for your patronage. Since you’ve overpaid, take these extra cords. Try them on the golden flower and choose whichever suits best—complimentary.”

Free cords suited Guan Yu perfectly—Siqi could select her preferred color later. Adorning her with it would surely enhance her beauty.

“Many thanks. I’ll return for future needs.” Guan Yu departed cheerfully, though doubting he’d ever revisit. He hurried off, fearing the shopkeeper might regret parting with the Ghost Butterfly Token—an item he deeply valued.

Guan Yu remembered Wang Xiaorong’s words: only two Ghost Butterfly Tokens existed in the Demon Soul Sect, held by her and the Demon Sovereign. How did a third appear here?

Was this token fake? Yet Guan Yu detected no flaws. Having scrutinized Wang Xiaorong’s token, he found this one identical.

According to the shopkeeper, his grandfather had possessed it, and he’d played with it since childhood. To verify its authenticity, Guan Yu longed to meet Wang Xiaorong immediately.

Chapter 4422: Unbrotherly Conduct

Guan Yu calculated the token had lain here for decades. Had the Demon Sovereign lost it here? Possible.

This remote area lacked Demon Soul Sect outposts, and few Jianghu travelers passed through. The token’s decades-long obscurity wasn’t surprising.

Once he found Wang Xiaorong, she could authenticate it. Even if genuine, she might not know its origins—perhaps only the Demon Sovereign did.

Guan Yu clearly recalled Wang Xiaorong’s explanation: the sect possessed only two Ghost Butterfly Tokens. The Demon Sovereign and she, the Young Mistress, each held one. The token symbolized the sect’s supreme authority—its bearer could command all disciples.

Thus, even elders and envoys lacked such tokens, possessing inferior ones instead.

Wang Xiaorong had explained that many sect disciples answered solely to the Demon Sovereign, mobilized only by the Ghost Butterfly Token.

In Jianghu, tokens often represented identity and command—like an emperor’s seal. Without it, authority crumbled.

Similarly, Cloud Azure Sect’s Sect Leader Xuanming used a leader’s token to enforce orders. The Demon Soul Sect’s Ghost Butterfly Token functioned identically—disciples required its presentation for obedience.

At Unparalleled Sword Manor, only the Manor Lord’s token legitimized command.

Possessing this token meant commanding all Demon Soul Sect disciples—even envoys would submit. Guan Yu found this notion amusing—perhaps keeping it secret from Wang Xiaorong might prove useful later.

Yet he feared her anger upon discovery and the risk of Cloud Azure Sect finding it. If so, he’d be irrevocably implicated—it must remain hidden.

Verification with Wang Xiaorong was essential. Comparing tokens would reveal the truth.

Currently, Guan Yu lacked time to seek her. Storing the token, he carried roasted sweet potatoes—a rare treat he hadn’t enjoyed in ages.

The sun dipped low, and the cooling air signaled stark day-night temperature shifts.

Returning to the inn, Guan Yu first encountered Aze, handing him the sweet potatoes. “Share these with whoever you see.” He kept two for himself and Siqi.

Aze said, “Roasted sweet potatoes? Rare delicacy! Take one for Wang Jun.”

“Deliver it yourself. I’ll bring one to Siqi. Not sure if she’s resting.” Guan Yu walked away.

Aze glared disdainfully. “Truly unbrotherly! Can’t spare a moment for Wang Jun? Obsessed with Siqi—can’t delay even a second. Shameless!”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu approached Siqi’s door and knocked softly.

“Siqi, are you there? I brought you something delicious.”

Moments later, Siqi opened the door, drowsy from interrupted sleep.

“I didn’t know you were resting. My apologies.” Most had been recuperating from last night’s ordeal—Lin Chen’s incident had unsettled everyone.

Siqi smiled faintly and stepped aside. “Come in. I’m fine—slept enough.”

Entering, Guan Yu noticed an unfamiliar, sweet fragrance permeating her room—unexpected, given her brief stay.

Though Siqi had a natural scent, two hours shouldn’t suffuse the room so strongly.

“What’s this fragrance? It’s lovely—sweet and pleasant.”

“The room smelled musty when I arrived, so I sprinkled some scented powder. Too strong? I’ll air it out.”

Chapter 4424: Envy

Tall and straight, Siqi still had to look up to meet Guan Yu’s eyes. He grinned. “You’ve no silver, and I lack nothing. A man buying gifts for his woman is natural—especially with my wealth. I buy what I like.”

“Your purchases are yours. My gift holds special meaning.” Siqi resolved, “I’ll find you a commemorative gift.”

Seeing her determination, Guan Yu relented. “Very well. I’ll await your gift—don’t forget.”

“I won’t.” Siqi changed subjects. “My Jade Ruyi lacks a pendant. Its loop could hold this golden flower. What do you think?”

“Splendid idea. Let me help.”

The Jade Ruyi had accelerated Siqi’s cultivation, its stored spiritual energy making it a coveted artifact for cultivators.

She produced the Jade Ruyi—more lustrous than ever, polished meticulously. Each time she handled it, thoughts of Guan Yu surfaced.

This mission with him delighted her—proximity sufficed, regardless of their future.

Attaching the golden flower enhanced the Jade Ruyi’s beauty. The reddish jade complemented the gold perfectly.

Guan Yu asked, “Does the Jade Ruyi serve you well?”

“Of course! My sisters envy me terribly—all beg to see it. Even Master borrowed it for inspection.”

Guan Yu recalled, “This Jade Ruyi once bore demonic energy conflicting with Cloud Azure’s techniques. Now it’s gone—did you suppress it?”

“Master helped. She said previous users were demonic cultivators, leaving residual energy. She purified it.”

“Elder Dai treats you kindly—surprising, given her stern reputation.”

“Master has always cared for me, indulging me often.”

The Jade Ruyi symbolized Siqi’s bond with Guan Yu—a treasure of power and memory, bridging their worlds.
