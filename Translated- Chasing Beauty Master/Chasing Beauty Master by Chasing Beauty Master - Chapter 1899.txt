“Our initial thoughts were indeed such,” Prince Zou continued. “Though outsiders breached the palace, no losses occurred—not even a single soldier was injured. Yet His Majesty feels profoundly insecure, to the point of losing sleep. Hence, he commanded me to investigate thoroughly.”

“However, despite deploying numerous forces to seal the city, we’ve achieved nothing. Thus, I’ve come to seek your counsel. Do you have any insights?”

Guanyu smiled. “Your Highness must have noticed the surge of cultivators in the capital. This stems from a particular incident. Now that the matter has concluded, even if you don’t drive them away, they’ll likely disperse on their own.”

“Oh? What incident provoked this?” Prince Zou pressed.

Though reluctant to elaborate, Guanyu deemed the disclosure harmless. “It concerns a cultivation manual from a millennium ago, created by a revered master. When rumors spread of its appearance within the palace’s inner courts, cultivators naturally flocked there. But the affair has ended, and further intrusions are unlikely.”

Prince Zou studied Guanyu with curiosity. “Guanyu, did you come to the capital seeking this manual?”

“Indeed. Your discernment is admirable,” Guanyu replied tactfully. “But rest assured—I neither invaded the palace nor obtained the manual. By the time I learned of it, the situation had already resolved.”

“I trust you implicitly,” Prince Zou said warmly. “Yet if His Majesty discovers cultivators caused this unrest, his wrath will escalate. Our current discourse would hold no sway before him.”

“Therein lies the difficulty,” Guanyu acknowledged. “These cultivators are elite disciples cherished by their sects. For the court to pursue them would provoke open conflict—a lose-lose scenario for all.”

“True,” Prince Zou sighed. “But the commotion was too great. Without resolution, His Majesty’s anger will fester.”

“Conflict between court and sects would bring mutual ruin,” Guanyu reasoned. “Our aim isn’t arrests, but appeasing His Majesty. Restoring his dignity suffices.”

“Precisely. Yet how?”

“Time or a diversion may ease tensions. Alternatively, apprehend a few Demon Soul Sect disciples. Their reputation for mischief makes them easy scapegoats. The Demon Lord won’t protest.”

Guanyu deemed this a temporary fix, enough to placate the emperor. Two days later, he prepared to return to his sect, the Eight-Drum Manual secured.

“Must we leave tomorrow?” Qiqi pouted. “Can’t we linger?”

Guanyu sighed. Returning to Yunqing Sect meant parting from Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, who’d rejoin the Demon Soul Sect. Their days of inseparable companionship made the separation bitter.

“The sect summons me urgently,” he said. “But if you wish, wait here. I’ll return swiftly after reporting.”

“Even days apart are unbearable,” Wang Xiaorong pleaded, clinging to his arm. “Delay your departure.”

“Very well. Stay a few more days, then accompany me. I’ll settle you near Yunqing Sect before reporting.”

“Splendid!” Qiqi cheered. “But what if Patriarch Xuanming restricts you?”

“He cannot curb my freedom,” Guanyu assured.

A knock interrupted them. “Young Master Wanhong! Chu Fan’s been abducted! We seek your aid!”

“What?!” Guanyu flung the door open. The Hongyan Opera House’s deputy manager stood breathless.

“Men stormed in, seized Chu Fan, and demanded the East Sea Dragon Pearl within three days!”

“The East Sea Dragon Pearl again?” Guanyu muttered. “Did you alert the Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence?”

“They’d never admit me. You’re our only hope!”

“Return quietly. I’ll handle this.”

After the man left, Guanyu pondered. “We must postpone our departure. Chu Fan needs rescuing.”

“But why target a mere actor?” Wang Xiaorong frowned.

“Chu Fan is Jiang Xin’s beloved,” Guanyu explained. “The kidnappers exploit her affection to pressure Jiang Yuan into surrendering the pearl. Unlike Jiang Xin, Chu Fan’s a disposable pawn.”

“But would Jiang Xin risk it?”

“She’ll likely plead with her father. Meanwhile, we’ll investigate. The culprit knows the capital intimately—perhaps someone close.”

News reached Jiang Xin, who stormed to her parents. “Chu Fan’s life outweighs some pearl! Give it to me!”

“Absurd!” Princess Zhang thundered. “That actor’s worthless!”

Jiang Yuan soothed his daughter. “The kidnappers won’t harm him without the pearl. We’ll find him.”

“If you don’t act, I’ll rescue him myself!” Jiang Xin threatened.

Princess Zhang paled. “Confine her! This chaos stems from that accursed pearl!”

“You approved acquiring it!” Jiang Yuan retorted.

“Enough! We must appease her before she involves the Emperor!”

As they argued, Guanyu deduced the mastermind lurked within the capital’s elite—possibly the Second Prince’s faction. Without evidence, he resolved to uncover the truth through discreet inquiry.
