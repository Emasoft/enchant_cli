“Thank you, Guan Yu.” One of them sat up. Fortunately, a wooden plank had been laid beneath them earlier—otherwise, they would have been lying in water.

The large wooden platform, positioned at the center of Xiaomei’s tent, had accommodated over a dozen people. Those sustained by spiritual power remained dry, but the areas where they sat on the plank were thoroughly soaked. Some only had dry shoulders, their bodies drenched everywhere else.

Including Siqi and Guan Yu, everyone below the waist was soaked. The rainwater had saturated the sand, nearly leveling the plank beneath them due to the fierce winds.

Siqi stood up to survey the changed surroundings. She remained relatively unharmed, as the spiritual power within her jade ruyi had not yet been depleted. Like Guan Yu, she had preserved her own energy and felt no exhaustion. The two of them stood unscathed, while others could only envy their resilience. Many now regretted not conserving their spiritual power earlier, though some still felt relief at having endured the ordeal.

At least they fared better than the two lying motionless on the ground. When Siqi rose, her legs felt numb, and her soaked lower half made her hesitate. She sat back down, not wanting others to notice her discomfort.

Another senior brother, aided by Guan Yu’s spiritual energy, managed to sit up. “Thank you, Guan Yu,” he said weakly.

“No need for formalities. I only did what I should,” Guan Yu replied. “The weather seems to be improving. We’ve survived this calamity, though it’s regrettable three senior brothers are missing.”

Now reborn from disaster, few dwelled on the lost companions. Survival itself felt miraculous.

With Guan Yu’s protective shield overhead, the others retracted their own. Aze exhaled deeply. “That was perilous, Wang Jun! I saw you nearly get swept away by the wind!”

“Nonsense,” Wang Jun retorted. “I stayed close to Siqi. Her shield held firm, and the ropes kept me secure.”

“Ah, perhaps I imagined it,” Aze conceded. “But I did see others lifted by passing tornadoes. Thank the heavens those ropes saved us.” The memory would haunt him forever.

The storm had finally relented—the winds gentler, rain lighter, thunder distant.

“This is my fault,” Guan Yu admitted. “I should have positioned myself centrally to monitor everyone. My poor placement endangered you all.”

In truth, the clever ones had claimed the safer central spots early. Guan Yu, prioritizing Siqi’s comfort, had led her to the edge. Wang Jun flanked her other side, unaware of the periphery’s risks.

The right side had borne the worst. The tornado had skirted their group from that direction, its fury concentrated there. The two outermost senior brothers on the right were nearly carried off, saved only by their tethers.

“Apologies won’t help now,” Wang Jun said pragmatically. “We’re fortunate most survived. Let’s focus on our next steps.”

Guan Yu agreed. Their situation remained dire—the camels had fled, leaving only a central post and a snapped rope. The grand tent had vanished, save for a few buried stakes. Once the rain ceased, they needed rest and a plan.

Their immediate challenge was the rain-saturated sand, which swallowed every step. The wooden platform had spared them from sinking waist-deep.

Guan Yu surveyed the desolate scene. Only a few stakes remained where tents once stood. Decisions had to be made swiftly.

“We should rest here,” Wang Jun advised. “Moving is impossible, and exhaustion plagues us.”

Fortunately, most carried provisions—except the two stricken senior brothers. Guan Yu shared his flatbread with them.

Nightfall limited visibility. “After eating,” Guan Yu instructed, “remove your soaked outer garments. They’re useless now.”

Though drenched, their layered travel clothes proved advantageous. Tents were lost with the camels, but personal items remained.

Siqi approached Guan Yu, offering a steamed bun. “Have you eaten?” he asked, concerned.

“I have another,” she assured him, revealing a half-eaten bun.

As Guan Yu accepted hers, Siqi inquired about his clothing plan. A raindrop struck his face—his shield spell had dissolved, its duration shortened by the storm’s intensity.

Renewing the shield with a sweep of his Luohun Blade, Guan Yu explained: “Our wet clothes will chill us tonight. If we fashion them into a windbreak, supported by my and Siqi’s spiritual power, we’ll endure better.”

The group agreed. Though some had spare clothes in soaked packs, enough fabric existed for a barrier.

Siqi faced another dilemma—changing clothes surrounded by others. She whispered to Guan Yu, who devised a solution. Retrieving two tent stakes, he constructed a makeshift partition using bundled garments.

“Perfect,” Siqi approved, quickly changing behind the hung clothes while Guan Yu stood guard.

Refreshed in dry clothes, Siqi emerged. “How can I help?”

“Patience,” Guan Yu replied. He uprooted the central stake and replanted it westward, then orchestrated the weaving of cloth strips into a large canopy.

Working together, they created a triangular shelter anchored by three stakes. The fabric walls blocked wind, while Siqi’s renewed shield muted the rain.

By midnight, the storm waned. Siqi lit a fire starter for light. “Not for warmth,” she clarified, leaning against Guan Yu.

The flame revealed their handiwork—improvised but functional. Though supplies dwindled, tomorrow promised calmer skies. For now, huddled in their cloth fortress, they awaited dawn.
