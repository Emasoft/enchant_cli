“Would you stop talking already? My plans were laid out beforehand, yet you keep disrupting them. How am I supposed to help you like this?”

“I only wanted to assist…” Liu Yishou’s voice quivered with grievance, but Guan Yu remained unmoved. He knew leniency now would only breed further recklessness in the old man.

Lang Tianhua’s patience had long evaporated. His frosty tone cut through the air, “Must you two keep staging this charade before me? I vowed not to slaughter anyone today, yet you push your luck. Do you truly wish me to break my oath?”

“Brother Tianhua, answer me plainly – regardless of what we say, will you drag me back today?”

Lang Tianhua inclined his head. “What do you think? Were I to release you, our captain would have my head. Then he’d dispatch greater forces. While capturing you might prove troublesome for our War Wolf Mercenary Corps, slaughtering you would be child’s play!”

“Bloodless demons! I know Withering Town wronged you, but after years of vengeance, haven’t you inflicted enough suffering? Countless innocents have perished by your hands! Why not show mercy?”

Lang Tianhua’s laughter boomed at Liu’s plea. “Mercy? Did they show any when branding us murderous butchers? You speak of cruelty while your kind massacres its own! During those hellish years, I realized the truth – kindness and compassion are lies. Humans decry magical beasts as evil, yet they’re the true monsters! Worse still, you prey on the weak while cowering before strength. Show them mercy, and they repay you with betrayal. Faced with death, they cloak themselves in righteous platitudes. Such is humanity’s vile nature!”

The accusation left Liu speechless. Guan Yu too found no rebuttal – as a human, he recognized the bitter truth. More crucially, Lang Tianhua’s soul now belonged wholly to vengeance and bestial fury. Reasoning with him proved futile.

After heavy silence, Guan Yu sighed. “Then words are wasted. Let us fight.”

“Had you yielded sooner, you’d both be trussed up already! Enough prattle!”

With bestial roar, Lang Tianhua charged. Guan Yu shoved Liu aside, “Take cover! Leave this to me!”

“Be careful! I’ll aid you if needed!”

Guan Yu suppressed a grimace. Lang Tianhua’s power rivaled at least a Magister’s, compounded by venomous mastery. While Guan Yu might hold his own, Liu – barely a Senior Mage – stood three tiers beneath them. In such battles where each strike meant death, the old man’s “help” would likely prove more hindrance.

Crimson flames erupted as Guan Yu leapt skyward, the verdant grass beneath his feet vaporizing to ash. This opening salvo revealed Lang Tianhua’s consummate skill – no mere bravado. Dread coiled tighter in Guan Yu’s gut. Survival demanded his utmost.

Far from dismayed by the missed strike, Lang Tianhua’s emerald eyes gleamed with predatory thrill. “Splendid! But this was mere greeting. Greater gifts await. Endure them, lest your earlier boasts ring hollow!”

Though anxiety gnawed him, Guan Yu’s demeanor betrayed nothing. A glance confirmed Liu’s safety in the thicket. “Unleash your tricks. Your War Wolf Corps intrigues me.”

“Impudent whelp! Have at you!”

Lang Tianhua’s form dissolved into smoke. A breeze whispered past Guan Yu’s ear – he raised defenses, only to whirl at Liu’s sudden scream. The mercenary now gripped the old man’s throat like a hunter clutching fresh prey.

“So bold earlier, old fool. What stills your tongue now?” Lang Tianhua’s claws tightened as Liu choked, “Beast…release me…”

“Release? How quaint. I spare your wretched life only by today’s oath – but know this: my true artistry lies in making men beg for death!”

Liu’s face grayed with agony. “Release him!” Guan Yu roared. “Our quarrel is between us! Bullying the weak befits your mercenary band?”

“Hypocrite! What ‘befits’ us? Freeing you? Enduring insults? Cease your moral posturing! To others, your ‘justice’ reeks as foul as any. Humans ever paint dissenters as evil while blind to their own sins. Pathetic!”

“Enough! Spare his life. Face me fairly. Should I fall, we submit to your will.”

Lang Tianhua pondered briefly. “Normally I’d refuse human bargains. But for a worthy opponent…very well.” His claws opened, dropping the gasping Liu.

“Elder Liu, flee!” Guan Yu urged.

“But you—”

“Can you aid me here? Go!” As Liu hesitated, Guan Yu snapped, “Find the cat!”

Watching the old man vanish into foliage, Guan Yu turned to his foe. “You’ll permit his departure?”

Lang Tianhua ignored the question, zeroing on their exchange. “‘Cat’? So this ally you seek?”

“Cease your guesses. Our duel begins!”

“So be it. But know this – you’ve not seen my true power!”

Their clash resumed with renewed fury. Having tasted Lang’s assault, Guan Yu avoided direct confrontation, leaping back thirty paces. Azure flames coalesced in his palms, their aura palpable even at distance.

“Impressive! Such vigor from human youth. I underestimated you.”

“Spare flattery. Unleash your hidden arts!”

Crimson and azure collided in cataclysmic burst, igniting hundred-meter radius. As flames roared, both combatants soared skyward, unleashing full-powered strikes that left them crashing into trees.

Guan Yu scrambled on a thick branch – only to freeze. The tree clung precariously to cliff’s edge, abyss yawning below. Lang Tianhua sneered, “Where will you flee now?”

“Flee? This precipice decides our match!” Guan Yu’s mind flashed to months prior – battling Locke above similar chasm. How far he’d come since! Yet now faced greater peril.

“Your perch has been…adjusted. Three seconds till it plummets.”

The tree creaked ominously. Guan Yu’s gut churned – surviving one fall didn’t guarantee repeat fortune. Leap forward into Lang’s jaws, or gamble with the void?

“Child’s trick! You think this frightens me?”

“Test it!” With thunderous crack, the trunk tilted toward oblivion.

“Hah! Still defiant?” Lang Tianhua crowed as Guan Yu teetered.

“I’ve leapt cliffs before! Did Locke not tell you?”

Recognition flickered in Lang’s eyes. “Ah! The Crystal Toad theft! Your doing?”

“None other!”

“Fool! This chasm’s no ordinary drop. Poison flora below ensures no survivor!”

Guan Yu grimaced. “A den of venom! Why’s everything here toxic?”

“Late epiphany! Though bound by oath not to kill you, the cliff’s embrace absolves me.” Dark tendrils lashed at Guan Yu’s perch. As he vaulted clear, the entire tree exploded into inferno.

“Boss! Incoming!”

The cry from below sparked relief. Lang Tianhua wheeled. “Who dares?”

“Your grandpa’s here!” Bicat erupted from the abyss, shadowy tendrils snatching Guan Yu to safety.

Lang gaped. “You’re…not human?”

“Brilliant deduction! Now scram – you’re beneath me!”

The mercenary’s shock deepened. “A talking beast?”

“You mangy mutt can speak, why not I? Half-breed abomination – enough talk!” Their exchange dissolved into combat. Guan Yu marveled – Bicat’s skills had evolved remarkably since last meeting.

After trading blows, Bicat yelled, “Boss! This mutt’s too tough! Retreat!”

“To where? He knows these hills better!”

Lang Tianhua jeered, “So this is your savior? A feeble kitten! Laughable!”

“We’ll spare you today!” Guan Yu shouted as they fled toward Withering Town. If War Wolves targeted Spirit Grove, Amy’s safety became paramount.

Thirty minutes later, panting in deserted streets, Bicat’s nose twitched. “Boss…wolf-stench nearby.”
