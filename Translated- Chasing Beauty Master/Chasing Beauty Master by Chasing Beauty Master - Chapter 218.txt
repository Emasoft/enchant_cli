Guan Yu's performance tonight completely surpassed Li Xi's expectations. First, there were those venomous insects, then disarming the bomb, and finally throwing it away—all seemingly impossible tasks accomplished by Guan Yu. At this moment, she felt he was even more enigmatic than she had imagined.

“Heh, no need. Have you forgotten my medical skills? This’ll be quick,” Guan Yu shrugged nonchalantly.

He examined his face in the rearview mirror, noticing several shards of glass deeply embedded in his forehead and both cheeks. Congealed blood stained his face, leaving him looking utterly disheveled.

The sight instantly shattered Guan Yu’s earlier good mood. Were it not for his treatment system ensuring his face would heal perfectly, he might have been permanently scarred. Though he didn’t consider himself exceptionally handsome, the women around him were all stunning beauties. As the saying went, “A fine horse deserves an elegant saddle.” How embarrassing it would be to walk alongside Wen Qing with a ruined face!

Focusing on the mirror, he located each glass fragment and decisively pulled them out one by one. With every extraction, he grimaced in pain, immediately activating the treatment system to staunch the bleeding. He only stopped the bleeding without fully healing the wounds for two reasons: first, his energy reserves were depleted after the earlier ordeal, and second, instantaneous recovery would seem too miraculous. The copper coin was his greatest secret—one he couldn’t risk exposing, even to his closest women. The fear of being targeted for his powers or dissected by government researchers outweighed everything else.

After what felt like an eternity, he removed all the glass shards and tossed them out the window. After cleaning the dried blood, he turned to Li Xi with a smile. “All set. Let’s go.”

He started the car while Li Xi studied him meaningfully without a word.

They hadn’t driven far when the vehicle jolted, stalled, and sank downward.

“What happened?” Li Xi asked.

“Probably a flat tire. I’ll check,” Guan Yu replied.

Exiting the car, he crouched by the wheel under his phone’s dim light and let out a bitter chuckle. Returning moments later, he sighed, “We drove too hard earlier. All four tires burst. We’ll need roadside assistance.”

“Thank you,” Li Xi murmured, meeting his gaze.

She understood why the tires had failed—had Guan Yu not raced here at breakneck speed upon learning she’d been captured with a ticking bomb? The green-haired man had said the drive from downtown took at least an hour. Every extra kilometer per hour heightened the risk. She could imagine the dangers Guan Yu had braved to arrive in fifteen minutes.

Though unsure how he’d achieved it, she knew his urgency stemmed from concern for her safety. Remembering his resolute expression as the bomb neared detonation warmed her heart.

Guan Yu knew what she meant. Waving a hand, he said gravely, “We both know who’s behind this. If not for me, you wouldn’t have offended Wan Qianshan or ended up in such peril. Saving you was my duty.”

Li Xi shook her head slightly. “If they truly wanted me dead, I’d have died at the hotel. Their target was always you. I was merely bait. Your death clearly matters more to them.”

Her analysis startled Guan Yu into contemplation. Could the mastermind not be Wan Qianshan? While they’d clashed, their feud hardly warranted such elaborate efforts. There was no blood vendetta between them.

“It is Wan Qianshan,” Li Xi stated firmly, anticipating his doubt.

“Why?”

“Because we humiliated him. He wants us both dead.”

“That simple?” Guan Yu frowned.

Li Xi nodded. “Consider this—if others wanted you dead, they’d target the women at your villa, not me. Besides Wan Qianshan and you, no one in N City even knew I was here.”

“Then why would he go to such lengths?” Guan Yu’s frown deepened, now convinced.

“I don’t know. Perhaps your influence here threatens him.”

“He walks his path, I walk mine. How could I threaten him?” Guan Yu chuckled dismissively.

Li Xi gave him a measured look. “What if he’s already extended his reach into N City?”

Guan Yu’s smile faded slowly.

After pondering, Li Xi elaborated, “I tested our captors. They don’t know Wan Qianshan—they belong to another faction with their own leader. They refused to name him, indicating covert operations.”

“If they’re Wan’s hidden forces, their secrecy warrants your vigilance. If mere collaborators, such a faction nearby spells endless danger. They’ve struck once; they’ll strike again. You have many women to protect.”

Guan Yu looked up at her strangely.

Li Xi paused, then flushed faintly at her phrasing. “I’m not one of your women.”

Guan Yu smirked—even the cleverest women err sometimes.

“What will you do?” she redirected.

His gaze turned blade-sharp. “If he’s entrenched here, I’ll root him out. However mighty he is in Taiwan, in N City—even a dragon must coil before me.”

Guan Yu had two inviolable principles: family and lovers. Wan Qianshan had violated the latter. Whatever the motive, retribution would follow.

“Let me describe the escaped man’s appearance. It might help identify their leader,” Li Xi offered.

Guan Yu waved dismissively. “When he fled, I memorized his face. Letting him escape was strategic—bait for bigger prey.”

Li Xi nodded, unaware Guan Yu had actually discerned the red-haired man’s features through her memories via his detection system.

Post-bombing, Guan Yu’s grasp of his supernatural abilities had deepened, enhancing their application. Yet frustration lingered—his powers had only upgraded once, granting 40% effectiveness. Full control remained elusive, as shown when his detection system revealed only wire-cutting steps, missing the pressure sensor intel. He desperately needed system upgrades but remained clueless on progression.

“What about the venomous insects?” Li Xi asked warily, glancing at the factory. Their initial swarm had terrified her—though Guan Yu’s control spared her, the others’ gruesome deaths still haunted her. The red-haired man’s survival behind her, untouched in a half-meter safe zone, hinted at Guan Yu’s unseen influence.

“The insects…” Guan Yu sighed toward the factory. “Let nature take them.”

The jewelry store heist had revealed his pet system’s terrifying potential. Though invaluable, the collapsing factory and prioritization of Li Xi’s safety left no recovery chance. Losing them pained him—they’d been battle game-changers.

“I need more venomous insects,” he mused internally. Their combat utility was unmatched.

Li Xi studied him curiously but asked nothing. Secrets were universal, after all.

Guan Yu almost regretted his prepared excuse—a tale of childhood mentorship in esoteric insect control—now wasted.

“Why so many stun batons?” Li Xi suddenly asked, lifting one from underfoot. Her movement accidentally revealed décolletage, flustering Guan Yu.

“Uh… self-defense,” he stammered.

“They’re all drained,” she countered pointedly.

“Er…”

“Related to the blown tires?” Her intuition struck again.

Cold sweat prickled Guan Yu’s neck. Her leap was terrifyingly accurate.

**Chapter 544: Rescue**

“What connection? Can’t electrocute tires. Don’t overthink,” Guan Yu deflected.

Though correct—the batons had powered his gravity system for the mad dash—he’d never admit it. Sustaining the system’s energy drain required constant car charging en route.

“You could,” Li Xi stated flatly.

Guan Yu widened his eyes innocently. “Really, no relation.”

Li Xi sighed. “I won’t pry. Everyone has secrets.”

“Thank you,” Guan Yu said earnestly.

She smiled.

Soon, headlights pierced the darkness. “Rescue’s here,” Guan Yu announced.

Luo Cheng emerged with a team. Guan Yu greeted him. “Thanks.”

Surveying the blast marks, Luo Cheng frowned. “You okay, Boss?”

Guan Yu shook his head.

“Who did this?” Luo Cheng growled.

“We’ll know tomorrow. Let’s head back.” Guan Yu’s calm tone belied simmering fury.

As Luo Cheng turned to leave, Guan Yu stopped him. “Take your men in one car. Leave me another—and privacy.”

Li Xi exited just then, her nightgown prompting Luo Cheng’s grin. “Understood! We’ll scram!”

Leaning close, Luo Cheng whispered, “Xin-jie knows about this. She doesn’t know about… her. Finish whatever you started—my lips are sealed.”

Guan Yu kicked his rear. “I was rescuing someone, you perv!”

Luo Cheng dodged, laughing. “Hero saves beauty—ends with wedding bells! Got it!” He fled chuckling.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes—some men were incorrigible.

After settling Li Xi at a secure hotel under Luo Cheng’s watch, Guan Yu returned home past midnight. The lit living room revealed Feng Xin waiting.

“Heard someone wants you dead,” she stated.

He nodded. “We’ll know soon.”

“Who?” Her voice turned lethal.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Patience.”
