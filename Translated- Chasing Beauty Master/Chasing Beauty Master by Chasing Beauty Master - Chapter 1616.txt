Such a large ingot of gold was certainly sufficient. They only needed to purchase ordinary horses rather than fine steeds, so this amount would undoubtedly suffice.

After all arrangements were made, Hongren's group of twenty-seven mounted their horses to travel with Guan Yu, while the Captain led the remaining members to the trading town to buy additional mounts.

Guan Yu's party swiftly returned to Silver Town with Hongren's group, encountering no delays along the road. Though their journey was relatively brief, darkness had already fallen by their arrival. Leading everyone directly back to the inn, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong reported the situation to Prince Zou, who expressed great satisfaction. Though the daily expenditure of a hundred taels per person seemed steep, Prince Zou urgently required such formidable protectors to ensure his safety.

When Hongren paid respects to Prince Zou, his imposing physique drew admiring glances from many present. After clarifying all arrangements regarding the Captain's mission and concluding the day's exhausting affairs, Guan Yu suggested retiring early.

Prince Zou declared, "Excellent. The Captain should return shortly with reinforcements. Wu Hui, arrange accommodations for Hongren's group. Let us all rest early to prepare for tomorrow's departure."

Returning to their chamber, Wang Xiaorong questioned, "Why did you give the Captain gold from your own purse for purchasing horses? Shouldn't Hongren bear that expense?"

"This serves to win their loyalty," Guan Yu replied with a smile.

"Loyalty? To what end?" she pressed. "Prince Zou's perilous journey may claim many lives from Hongren's band. Why court favor now?"

Guan Yu chuckled, "Hongren strikes me as honorable and trustworthy. Moreover, the gold originated from Prince Zou's coffers. When the Captain reports this expenditure, do you imagine our Prince would neglect to reimburse me?"

"You've always been shrewd with calculations," Wang Xiaorong leaned her head against his shoulder. "Though wealth means little to you, scheming remains second nature. As we approach the capital tomorrow, I find myself wishing this journey might never end."

"Don't dwell on such thoughts," Guan Yu stroked her hair. "We can't play escort to Prince Zou forever. Tell me - has Left Envoy recalled Yan Zhao from the Imperial Guards? Should that viper continue harassing you, I'll show no mercy regardless of his Demon Soul Sect ties."

"I've contacted Left Envoy. Yan Zhao should have received his recall orders by now. Disobedience would mark him for sect execution."

"Good - that fly is swatted." Guan Yu reassured her, "My quest for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique's second volume won't take long. We'll reunite soon."

Wang Xiaorong sighed, "We must cling to hope. Though our stations differ vastly, none can hinder our union - not Xuan Ming, not even the Demon Sovereign himself." Her words carried forced optimism, a necessary armor against despair.

She often fantasized about secluding themselves in Swordless Manor, abandoning the martial world entirely. Yet she recognized this as selfishness - Guan Yu fought to break the seal imprisoning her mind. She must support him silently.

Guan Yu contemplated their path ahead. After delivering Prince Zou to the capital, the desert awaited. There, Demon Soul Sect's Left and Right Envoys would surely appear, even if the Demon Sovereign remained secluded. Confrontation loomed inevitable.

Though confident the Envoys dared not kill him for fear of Wang Xiaorong's wrath, Guan Yu similarly couldn't eliminate them without jeopardizing her position. This delicate balance complicated matters.

The Eight-Sided Drum Technique's second volume remained paramount - key to unlocking Wang Xiaorong's seal. While Cloud Azure Sect's Merit Cauldron might achieve similar results, obtaining it proved more challenging than the drum technique. Elder Jiu alone surpassed Guan Yu's capabilities, let alone the Cauldron's guardian - the elder who'd once saved his life.

Rumors suggested new guardianship of the Cauldron, but details remained unclear. Cloud Azure Sect's true strength dwarfed Demon Soul Sect's, its hidden elders capable of overwhelming the demonic faction.

"Xiaorong," Guan Yu broke the silence, "does Demon Soul Sect possess elders beyond the Sovereign and Envoys?"

"Certainly," she replied. "There's Elder Xia, though others remain reclusive, ancient beings detached from worldly affairs."

This mirrored Cloud Azure Sect's structure, balancing the factions' hidden strengths. When questioned about his interest, Guan Yu explained mere curiosity regarding sect parity.

Wang Xiaorong elaborated, "All longstanding sects - righteous like Crimson Lotus and True Sun, or demonic like ours - maintain such elder hierarchies. Only minor factions like Blackblood Ridge lack this depth."

Guan Yu observed, "The righteous factions' growth threatens Demon Soul Sect's survival. With Blackblood Ridge destroyed and Monster Cavern's sisters vanished, your father shoulders the entire demonic resistance."

"Precisely," Wang Xiaorong nodded. "Father exhausts himself opposing the united righteous sects. Even the elusive Blood Hunt Sect remains missing despite extensive searches."

Guan Yu mused, "Either they hide skillfully or dissolved entirely. Yet a force that size couldn't vanish without trace. Perhaps they masquerade under new identities."

He theorized the righteous sects' inaction stemmed either from internal discord or fear of Demon Soul Sect's hidden power - likely the latter, given their typical hypocrisy.

Wang Xiaorong revealed the Demon Sovereign's failed attempts to reunify demonic factions. "If I were Blood Hunt Sect," she reasoned, "I'd hide rather than face annihilation or forced submission."

Guan Yu countered, "Hindered growth makes prolonged hiding impractical. Their continued existence puzzles me."

As they discussed, Wang Xiaorong's optimism resurfaced regarding the upcoming desert quest. "With Father in seclusion and Left Envoy commanding our forces, none can rival you for the drum technique."

Guan Yu remained cautious. "Competition will be fierce. All factions covet this legendary art. We must recreate the first volume's secrecy - only you and the Demon Sovereign know I possess it."

He expressed particular concern about the Demon Sovereign's potential appearance, though Wang Xiaorong assured her father's old injuries necessitated continued seclusion. These wounds, she confessed with guilt, originated from rescuing her during childhood folly.

"Don't blame yourself," Guan Yu comforted. "A father's protection is natural. Let past regrets rest."

Their conversation drifted to the martial world's shifting balance, each revelation adding complexity to their impending trials. As midnight approached, both warriors steeled themselves for the coming storm, their fates intertwined like duelists in a moonlit pavilion - poised between shadow and revelation.
