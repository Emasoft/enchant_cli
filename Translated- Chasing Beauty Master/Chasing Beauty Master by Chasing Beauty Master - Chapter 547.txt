Though Guan Yu had vaguely anticipated that Lang Tianhua might be the former tomb guardian, hearing the confession directly still sent a ripple of shock through him.

Yet he knew this critical moment demanded composure. Any display of tension would disadvantage him in the coming confrontation. Forcing a laugh, Guan Yu feigned calmness. "How pitiful you are!"

"Pitiful? You've got it backwards!" Lang Tianhua sneered, baring yellowed teeth. "The doomed ones here are you two. Your lives end by my hand today!"

Unperturbed, Guan Yu continued laughing. The sound grated on Lang Tianhua's nerves like broken glass. "What's so amusing? Facing death's door, yet you dare laugh?"

"Of course we fear death," Guan Yu replied coolly, his gaze sharpening like honed steel. "But your half-living existence disgusts me more than any grave."

"Disgusting?" Lang Tianhua licked cracked lips. "This 'disgust' forged my supreme cultivation! The hero who saved humanity became the outcast. Why cling to empty morals? I've slain my tormentors. Now all shall taste my suffering!"

His mad laughter echoed through the clearing. "You understand nothing! My purpose is to make every human writhe in greater agony than mine! Only then comes true ecstasy!"

"Deranged fiend!" Guan Yu spat. "Since words fail, I'll purge your evil from Azure Beauty Continent!"

Lang Tianhua's snort carried glacial contempt. "Purge me? Boy, do you comprehend true power? Let me enlighten you - I'm an assassin from the War Wolf Mercenary Corps!"

"Mercenary corps?" The term immediately reminded Guan Yu of Wei Buqun. Had that troublesome rat survived somehow?

Outwardly calm, Guan Yu assessed his opponent. Though unable to gauge Lang Tianhua's exact cultivation level, the man's aura surpassed even Wei Buqun's. More alarmingly, the faint herbal reek clinging to his robes betrayed expert poisoncraft.

"War Wolf Corps," Lang Tianhua preened. "Your ignorance proves your provincialism. But surely you know the Blackwater Corps?"

Guan Yu's laugh rang sharp as a blade leaving its scabbard. "Blackwater? More like Trashwater! Their grand leader Wei Buqun fell to my sword. Will you share his fate?"

Muscles coiled, Guan Yu prepared to strike. Yet instead of attacking, Lang Tianhua erupted in laughter after three heartbeats of silence. "Marvelous! I adore brash youths like you!"

"Flattery won't save you," Guan Yu retorted, though unease prickled his neck.

"Here's bitter news, fledgling. Your 'slain' Wei Buqun still breathes."

Guan Yu's composure cracked. He'd seen Wei Buqun's lifeblood soak the earth. Had poison preserved that wretch? Or had dark arts cheated death?

"Believe what you will," Lang Tianhua purred. "Normally I don't chatter with corpses-to-be. But you... you're special. A rare talent, though doomed."

"Save your honeyed lies!" Guan Yu snapped. "My duty is delivering you to justice!"

Lang Tianhua's eyes narrowed to venomous slits. "Magister-level at your age? Impressive. But if you think glib words can defeat me..."

As Guan Yu probed with spiritual sense, an oppressive aura suddenly erupted from Lang Tianhua. The tomb guardian had been suppressing his true power! Now unleashed, the crushing pressure matched Guan Yu's own cultivation. Worse still - the poison threat.

"While we conversed," Lang Tianhua crooned, "death took root around you."

Guan Yu's gaze dropped. Among the grass blades, pale maggot-like creatures writhed - Corpse Rot Grubs he'd seen earlier. One touch meant excruciating demise.

"Wait!" Guan Yu stalled. "This War Wolf Corps - what's your aim?"

"To watch empires burn," Lang Tianhua breathed. "We're darkness perfected. While lesser corps brawl for scraps, we cultivate true power - though fools label it forbidden."

Old Liu's sudden gasp interrupted. "War Wolf... The Shadow Blade of Dark Alliance!"

Guan Yu pressed the advantage. "Hunted by righteous sects, forced to skulk like cockroaches - is this your vaunted supremacy?"

Lang Tianhua's face darkened, veins bulging black beneath sallow skin. "You court agony, whelp."

"Your 'ally' Locke plays you for fools!" Guan Yu bluffed desperately. "That traitor betrays everyone. After using you to crush elves, he'll turn on your corps next!"

A muscle twitched in Lang Tianhua's jaw. Guan Yu pressed harder. "You think him content with elven lands? His hunger will consume your War Wolves whole!"

For three breaths, silence hung thicker than swamp mist. Then Lang Tianhua's rasping chuckle broke the stillness. "Clever pup. Let's converse... while poison seeps through your veins."

Guan Yu's heart chilled. He'd bought time, but at what cost? The grubs inched closer as their masters parleyed. Somewhere beyond the clearing, a wolf's howl echoed - whether omen or ally, none could tell.

Suddenly, Lang Tianhua's jaws distended unnaturally, inch-long fangs glistening green. "Shall I tell you why I favor biting? Venom brings such... intimacy with death's approach."

Guan Yu's skin crawled. Every instinct screamed to flee, but retreat meant abandoning Old Liu. As the fangs lunged, a silver blur intercepted - Bisque Cat's claws met corrupted ivory in a shower of sparks.

The battle proper began.
