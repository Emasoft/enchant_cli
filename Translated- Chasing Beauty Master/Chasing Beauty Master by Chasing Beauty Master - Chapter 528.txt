Allen, satisfied that the crowd had quieted down, nodded and continued, "In truth, I've been contemplating this announcement for a considerable time. However, as the timing wasn't ripe until now, I withheld it. Today, seizing this opportunity, I declare my resignation as clan leader."

The assembly froze at these words. None could comprehend why a perfectly capable leader would suddenly step down.

"Chief Allen, you mustn't resign! We all need you!"

"Indeed, our earlier criticisms were mere jests – no malice intended!"

Listening to these pleas, Allen felt unexpectedly moved. Though some followers had proven fickle and vexing, swaying with the wind and distorting truths, their fundamental discernment in crucial matters heartened him.

"Chief Allen," spoke Locke with exaggerated deference, "I recall your vow in the council hall – to resign if failing to heal the Tree of Life within three days. Yet today you succeeded. This junior admires your resolve and shall never doubt you again."

Though Locke bowed like a penitent, Allen remained unmoved, discerning the simmering rebellion beneath the young leader's courteous facade. This viper would strike when least expected.

"Truth be told," Allen declared, "I recognize Locke's ambitions. The leadership shouldn't remain the sole province of elders. My resignation isn't abdication, but a challenge to our youth – let us measure strengths!"

The assembly stirred with excitement, though only Locke grasped the subtext: *I grant you this chance. Seize it if you can.*

Among the crowd, Elder Kyle trembled with suppressed elation. Three decades of waiting culminated in this moment to topple Allen. He urgently signaled Locke, whispering, "Accept any terms! I have plans."

Locke rose abruptly, locking eyes with Allen. "What manner of contest do you propose, Clan Leader?"

"As elder and current leader, I leave rule-setting to you. Let none accuse me of favoritism."

Locke staggered at this unexpected boon. Crafting the rules himself guaranteed Allen's defeat! Feigning deliberation, he proclaimed, "True competition demands spectacle! As the elves' mightiest warriors, let us stage three battles – two victories decides leadership!"

The crowd erupted. Challenging Allen? Even ten matches wouldn't secure two wins against the Archmage! The chasm between Magus and Archmage dwarfed all expectations.

Even Guan Yu frowned, muttering, "The boy covets leadership yet proposes suicidal terms? What trickery brews here?"

As confusion reigned, Locke clarified: "Three versus three! Each side fields three champions. Victorious faction claims leadership!"

Understanding dawned with dreadful clarity. Allen's faction held Allen himself (Archmage), one Elder (early-stage Magus), and Guan Yu (barely a Master Mage). Locke's cadre boasted two mid-stage Magus elders, Kyle (peak Magus), and Locke himself (early Magus). The odds tilted disastrously.

Allen paled. Bound by honor, he couldn't protest, yet compliance meant certain defeat. As tension thickened, Guan Yu stepped forward, having deciphered Locke's scheme. Victory seemed possible only through divine intervention.

"Chief Allen," Locke taunted, "you lament your shortage of experts? Does this seem unfair?"

Allen's retort rang hollow: "We'll neither yield nor predict outcomes prematurely. Battle alone reveals truth!"

Guan Yu's heart sank at the leader's stubborn pride. Everyone knew the mismatch – why posture?

With terms set, Locke smirked. "Allow me final courtesy – after today, you may no longer be our leader."

"Spit it out, whelp!" roared the crimson-faced Shi Tuo, restrained by Guan Yu from attacking. "He baits you," Guan Yu warned. "Play the victim before the crowd. Endure!"

Locke announced his trio: Elder Kyle, Elder Carter, and himself – the expected strongest lineup. All eyes turned to Allen's pending selection.

The leader closed his eyes, visibly tormented. Choosing combatants meant gambling lives, for Locke's faction would spare no cruelty in pursuit of power.

As speculation swirled ("Has Allen lost nerve?" "Why still call him leader?"), Allen revealed his champions: "Myself, Fiat, and Guan Yu."

Uproar followed. "Guan Yu? The dragonkin? A mere Master Mage against elites!"

"Yet dragons possess explosive might! Didn't he slay a human Sword King yesterday?"

"Ridiculous rumor! This insults elven prowess!"

Unperturbed, Guan Yu pondered Allen's choice. Why select him over stronger candidates like Shi Tuo?

The rhino-man himself demanded answers. "Why choose the boy over me?"

Allen sighed. "Could you guarantee victory? Guan Yu's true power transcends appearances."

**Chapter 1337: Clash of Titans**

With teams chosen, the crucial arrangement remained. Surprisingly, Locke proposed drawing lots for battle order – uncharacteristic fairness that heightened suspicion.

Two priestesses approached with opaque boxes. As the enchanting Shao Siming presented hers to Guan Yu, she refused to meet his gaze.

"What friends we are," Guan Yu teased. "I risk life itself, yet you won't look at me?"

Shao Siming finally glanced up, eyes glistening. "Fool! Had you been less brash... Just – retreat if overwhelmed. Or I'll truly ignore you forever!"

The lots revealed disastrous alignment:
Allen (1st) vs Carter
Fiat (2nd) vs Kyle
Guan Yu (3rd) vs Locke

Allen's hopes dimmed. Only his own match seemed certain. Fiat stood little chance against peak Magus Kyle, and Guan Yu's duel with Locke remained a toss-up.

"Worry not," Guan Yu encouraged. "Facing death, let's fight gloriously!"

Shi Tuo growled, "Pummel that Locke-brat for me!"

As the crowd placed bets ("A hundred gold on Locke!" "Done!"), Locke shocked all by postponing the match to next morning. What schemes required extra hours? Allen accepted warily – time might allow countermeasures.

"Tomorrow at eight," Allen declared. "We settle this."
