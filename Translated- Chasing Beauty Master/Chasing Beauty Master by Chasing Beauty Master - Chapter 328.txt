“Hmph, doing such embarrassing things without any shame.” Feng Xin snorted disdainfully.

“Aiya, I wonder whose loud moans filled the night - so wild and proactive, dressed like a queen with endless creative ideas. Compared to Xin'er, my efforts pale in comparison.” Wen Qing chuckled behind her hand.

“You...” Feng Xin flushed crimson but couldn't refute. Remembering how seamlessly Wen Qing had cooperated with her last night left her feeling stifled.

“Alright, enough bickering.” Guan Yu rubbed his temples wearily.

He'd hoped their relationship would improve after last night's "harmonizing," but their immediate quarrel suggested they needed more "practice." Remembering last night's exhilarating scenes, Guan Yu's thoughts wandered. Rubbing his hands mischievously, he suggested, “Shall we continue tonight?”

“In your dreams! I'm leaving!” Feng Xin coldly departed without looking back.

Giggles followed as Wen Qing purred, “Husband, since Xin'er refuses you tonight, come to my room. I've prepared several enticing outfits~”

Guan Yu's blood surged as he nodded eagerly.

Wen Qing's deliberately loud conversation reached Feng Xin's ears. Pausing momentarily, Feng Xin clenched her fists until her knuckles whitened.

She'd lost again - outmaneuvered by Wen Qing's provocation!

Wen Qing's victory meant Feng Xin couldn't claim Guan Yu tonight. Sighing at his romantic entanglements, Guan Yu retreated to his room where Gao Wei lay pale on his bed.

The ancient coin in Guan Yu's consciousness glowed softly, its Diagnostic System scanning Gao Wei's poisoned body. The mysterious cavern's toxins proved more virulent than anticipated. Though Guan Yu had neutralized most poison, residual toxins still eroded Gao Wei's organs.

Days passed until evening when Gao Wei awoke to find Guan Yu's exhausted face hovering above her, his hands channeling healing energy through her body. After hours of treatment, color returned to her cheeks.

“Thank you,” Gao Wei whispered weakly.

Days later during N University's centennial celebration, crowds swarmed campus gates for glimpses of celebrity alumni like Gao Wei. Amidst bustling preparations, Guan宇 found himself coordinating backstage where Wen Qing directed chaos:

“Check lighting! Verify screen effects! Where's Wen Ya? The finale dance depends on her!”

Meanwhile, Wen Ya sat vigil at her mother's hospital bedside as cancer worsened - unaware her absence threatened the grand performance.
