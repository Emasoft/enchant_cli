However, last night, Hayakawa Shigeru received intelligence that Sakurako had been with a Chinese man after work and was inexplicably captured by Watanabe Corporation's people. At the time, Hayakawa didn't pay much attention, knowing how strictly Eastern Island had been scrutinizing Chinese tourists recently, assuming it must be some Chinese traveler who offended the corporation.

Chapter 1725: The Duel

Later, Hayakawa learned this wasn't a simple matter. Ichiro Takahashi had personally rushed to Watanabe Corporation's headquarters regarding Sakurako's incident, apparently offering an enormous ransom sum, yet ultimately failed to retrieve her. Hayakawa realized Watanabe Corporation was deliberately targeting Sakurako herself.

When Hayakawa went to Watanabe Corporation today, intending to pressure them using his family's influence combined with Takahashi Group's financial might, he was informed Sakurako had already left. The Chinese man detained with her yesterday had reportedly been killed by Watanabe's people.

Just as Hayakawa relaxed, someone informed him Sakurako had dined at a French restaurant that afternoon with another stranger. Unable to contain himself any longer, Hayakawa resolved to confront Sakurako directly about her recent behavior and why she kept appearing with different men on consecutive days.

Hearing Guan Yu's accented Chinese, Hayakawa frowned. The voice confirmed another Chinese man. Guan Yu no longer resembled his initial Eastern Island arrival persona nor his low-level thug disguise after leaving Watanabe Corporation, having now assumed another Dragon Group-prepared identity.

According to this cover, Guan Yu was a Chinese youth who immigrated to Eastern Island over a decade ago as an international student, currently employed at a major local corporation.

Suspicion arose in Hayakawa's mind: Could Sakurako favor Chinese men? If she's dating different Chinese suitors these past days, then as an Eastern Islander, he might stand no chance. Should he immigrate to China for a Chinese identity?

This thought flickered briefly before Hayakawa roared at Guan Yu: "Who are you? What right do you have interrupting my conversation with Sakurako?"

As a prominent figure in Hokujo's upper circles, most recognized the Hayakawa family's young master and his entanglement with Takahashi Sakurako. When Sakurako appeared dining with an obvious outsider today, observers anticipated drama. Now with Hayakawa's outburst, the entire restaurant's attention focused on them.

A waiter approaching with the next course froze at Hayakawa's aggression. Though such establishments prohibited disturbances, none dared restrain someone of his status.

Unfazed, Guan Yu stood calmly, smiling: "Shouting reveals your insecurity. A man without confidence can't attract women. We Chinese say: 'Friendship may blossom at first meeting, while lifelong companions remain strangers.' Some connections form instantly—"

Most Eastern Island elites received classical Chinese education. Well-versed in literature and arts, Hayakawa needed no explanation. Guan Yu's patronizing tone infuriated him. Suppressing another shout, he hissed: "Silence! I know this saying. You claim instant rapport with Sakurako? Then state your credentials! What's your family background? Assets? Can you even support her?"

"Money buys houses, not homes. Beds, not sleep. Clocks, not time. Wealth matters less than mutual affection. Love builds families—don't you understand?" Guan Yu deliberately provoked with philosophical rhetoric.

Many diners recognized Guan Yu's taunting. Murmurs spread inquiring about the stranger's identity.

Hayakawa, not foolish, saw through the humiliation attempt. Inhaling deeply, he retorted: "I've heard: 'Love at first sight is lust; long-term love is calculation'—your Chinese sayings! I suspect you pursue Sakurako for lust or profit. My devotion is Hokujo's worst-kept secret. Though young now, she'll eventually appreciate my dedication! We're social equals—what are you?"

Guan Yu smiled: "If neither instant nor gradual love counts, what does? Shouldn't Sakurako decide?"

Earlier annoyed by Guan Yu's reticence, Sakurako now delighted seeing him outmaneuver Hayakawa. Beaming, she declared: "I choose to be with him. I love you!"

Unthinkable in reserved Eastern Island society—the Takahashi heiress publicly professing love to a man of seemingly inferior status.

In Sakurako's eyes, Hayakawa saw unprecedented happiness—the甜蜜 of a woman wholly committed. His heart shattered, realizing he'd never hold that place.

The once-ferocious Hayakawa crumbled at her words, turning to leave. In that moment, Guan Yu felt unexpected pity—this man's love was genuine, not mercenary.

After several steps, Hayakawa halted: "No!"

As the couple rose, Guan Yu frowned: "What now? Still unresolved?"

Shaking his head, Hayakawa said: "Not that. I accept defeat, but doubt your ability to protect her. I challenge you to a duel!"

Guan Yu sighed at the suddenly impassioned man: "Brother, this isn't medieval Europe. Spare me the knightly theatrics."

Chapter 1726: Fushi Mountain Foothills

Guan Yu's caviar enjoyment ruined by Hayakawa's theatrics increased his irritation. Unfazed, Hayakawa insisted: "You know Sakurako's status as Takahashi Group's sole heiress. She needs a protector! Yesterday's kidnapping proves her vulnerability. With my strength—"

Guan Yu nearly laughed—this second-class mutant boasting strength? He could crush first-class mutants effortlessly. Yet objectively, a twenty-something second-class mutant ranked highly in Eastern Island.

Stubborn mule. A demonstration might humble his Sino-phobic arrogance. "Fine. Name the venue—after dinner."

Dusk approached. Post-meal darkness mattered little—the full moon promised dramatic ambiance.

Hayakawa nodded: "Fushi Mountain foothills. Our family villa there—Sakurako knows it."

As Guan Yu resumed dining, anxious Sakurako calmed sensing his confidence. His subtle spiritual energy soothed her worries, allowing shared enjoyment.

Despite the upscale crowd, gossips spread news rapidly. Before dessert, Hayakawa's duel announcement trended online. Bookmakers offered 10:1 odds against Guan Yu—until Sakurako and friends bet millions on him, prompting odds adjustments to 8:1.

Guan Yu chuckled at his potential $80 million windfall: "Eastern Island's generosity overwhelms!"

Sakurako warned: "Don't underestimate Hayakawa! His second-class mutation enables teleportation and masterful swordsmanship. Losing means more than money—it's humiliation!"

She understood her father's potential objections—half Takahashi Group's trillion-yen assets going to a Chinese spouse faced political and familial resistance. Guan Yu's victory could sway opinions.

Unbeknownst to her, Guan Yu's Huanyu Group ranked sixth in China post-Ouyang acquisition, worth quadrillions—eclipsing Takahashi's holdings.

Giving a thumbs-up, Guan Yu leapt from their sports car upon arriving at the moonlit Fushi foothills, where media crews and luxury vehicles already crowded the slopes. The snow-capped peak glowed bridal white under moonlight.

"Wouldn't I look stunning in wedding dress too?" Sakurako mused driving past, eliciting Guan Yu's diplomatic agreement.

Noticing unusual traffic, she gasped: "Are all these people coming to watch?"

Guan Yu sighed: "What else attracts these socialites beyond hotels and clubs?"

Though initially wanting Hayakawa humiliated, Sakurako now worried: "If you defeat him publicly, tomorrow's headlines might ruin him."

"Should I throw the match?" Guan Yu teased.

Instantly protective, Sakurako shouted: "Absolutely not! Crush him completely!"

Such mercurial moods confirmed feminine enigma—even for a veteran like Guan Yu.

Chapter 1727: Odds Upheaval

Arriving at the Hayakawa villa, they found hillsides packed with luxury cars and media crews. Bookmakers, having slashed Guan Yu's odds after Sakurako's bets, now offered 8:1—too late for Guan Yu's last-minute million-dollar wager.

"Easy money!" Guan Yu gloated checking his phone. Sakurako reminded: "His teleportation and sword skills are real! Don't get cocky!"

She knew this duel's outcome could influence her father's approval. Though unaware, Guan Yu's corporate empire dwarfed her family's.

With a confident nod, Guan Yu vaulted onto the moonlit slope, ready to teach Eastern Island's golden boy a lesson in humility.
