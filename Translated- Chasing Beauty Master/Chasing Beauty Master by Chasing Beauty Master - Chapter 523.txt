“Hmm, while we were escaping, I hid in a corner and overheard his conversation with Wei Buqun.”

“Oh? What did they say?”

Guanyu glanced around cautiously before whispering, “Wei Buqun ordered Kyle to help attack us, mentioning some sort of agreement between them!”

“So that’s it!”

“What’s wrong, Clan Leader?”

Allen suddenly realized something. “This morning, Locke kept asking about you and Amy’s whereabouts. He must have realized I sent you to find Shituo. They colluded with the Blackwater Mercenary Group to kill you both before you could return to the Elven Forest.”

“A pity their ‘perfect’ plan was thwarted single-handedly by Brother Guanyu!” Shituo chuckled, clapping Guanyu’s shoulder.

Though relieved by Guanyu’s formidable magical prowess, Allen’s eyes dimmed with sorrow. This confirmed suspicions of Locke and Kyle’s rebellion, foreshadowing imminent strife within the Elven Forest.

“If it cannot be avoided, we must resign ourselves to fate.”

With a sigh, Allen led the group onto the Isle of Life.

Standing before the island, Guanyu immediately noticed the Life Tree’s faded greenery compared to a month prior. Its sparse leaves hung lifelessly, drained of vitality.

Shituo surveyed the blighted landscape mournfully. “Such a tragedy—this magnificent Life Tree reduced to this wretched state.”

“Indeed. Should it perish under my watch, I’d be eternally damned in elven history!”

“Save your sighs, Clan Leader. Let me investigate. If gu poison is truly the culprit, I may yet have solutions!”

As Shituo strode forward, Guanyu and Allen followed. Upon reaching the island, they spotted a shadowy figure hundreds of meters away glaring coldly at them.

“Who stands there?”

Amy glimpsed Locke in the distance, but the figure vanished before her words faded.

“Focus on the tree first!”

Shituo plucked a fallen leaf near a towering tree, revealing faint violet-black veins marring its surface. “Observe these purple veins, Clan Leader. These are young leaves that shouldn’t shed naturally!” He nibbled a fragment.

“What’s the verdict?” Guanyu pressed.

“Tasteless—further proof of gu poison.”

Guanyu frowned. “But isn’t gu poison toxic?”

“Gu’s essence differs from conventional poison. It’s a parasitic formation that infiltrates its host, corrupting internal systems through altered rules.”

“Ah! Like a computer virus!” Guanyu exclaimed, astonished by this parallel to his world’s digital threats.

“Computer virus? Brother Guanyu, your words baffle us.” Shituo, Allen, and Amy stared at him like he’d sprouted horns.

Guanyu chuckled, swelling with pride. “Imagine crafting a program—or formation—that infiltrates a target, forcibly altering its code to disrupt normal functions. The ‘poisoning’ is merely the visible symptom.”

“Brilliant! Though I grasp but half your meaning, you’ve captured gu’s essence!” Shituo praised.

Flattered, Guanyu preened as Amy tugged his sleeve eagerly. “Dragon Brother, explain it again!”

“Later, little one. Duty first.”

Guanyu turned serious. “Master Shituo—can gu poison affect humans?”

“Certainly! But gu requires prolonged preparation. In swift combat between masters, there’s no time for such scheming. It thrives among familiars who let down their guard.”

Guanyu’s gaze shifted to Allen, suddenly fearing Locke might have poisoned the clan leader.

“How does one detect gu infection?”

“Persistent lad! Planning mischief?” Shituo arched a brow.

“Merely curiosity. Enlighten me?”

“Symptoms vary by gu type and incubation period. Rapid-acting gu provokes reactions within hours—harmless to true masters. Slow-acting gu accumulates silently. Victims feel nothing for weeks until agony strikes—by then, it’s often fatal.”

“Damned potent! Why learn magic when gu’s deadlier?” Guanyu joked. “Master Shituo, teach me! I’ll dose every foe!”

Shituo pierced him with a look. “Should your intent be malice, you’ll learn nothing from me.”

Guanyu flushed. “A jest! You know I’m no villain.”

“Really? Need I mention how the Blackwater captain perished?”

Allen interjected sharply, “Shituo, what’s this about?”

“Nothing!” Guanyu waved hastily. “Merely banter. Let’s focus.”

Approaching a sapling, Allen declared, “Enough talk. Testing this tree will confirm gu’s presence.”

“Shouldn’t we identify the specific gu first?” Guanyu interposed.

Shituo snorted. “Pupil lecturing master? I’ve studied gu for two centuries. Hold your tongue!”

“By the leaves’ markings, it’s insect gu—simple to purge. A few hours’ work.”

After incantations and rituals that stretched into dusk, Shituo gestured to a leaf. “See the improvement?”

Guanyu inspected the leaf—though not fully verdant, its dark veins had receded. “Progress! Our theory holds!”

Invigorated, Shituo leapt atop a tree, unleashing emerald radiance that bathed the island. Portions of the forest regained luster, but deeper infections lingered.

“Enough!” Guanyu shouted as sweat drenched Shituo’s anguished face. “You’ll kill yourself!”

Ignoring warnings, Shituo roared, “Lend me your qi!”

Guanyu sprang up eagerly. At Shituo’s touch, his arm locked as energy surged out—his limb swelling grotesquely.

“Can you endure?”

“Do it!” Guanyu gritted through the torment.

With a final exertion, blinding light erupted. The forest erupted in vibrant green as leaves regenerated en masse.

“Eternal gratitude!” Allen wept. “You’ve saved our people!”

A thud interrupted—Guanyu collapsed, limp as a ragdoll.

“Dragon Brother!” Amy screamed, tears streaming.

“He’s merely drained,” Allen reassured, though fear laced his voice.

Shituo staggered down, marveling, “The boy’s reserves astonished me. Yet... why does his energy feel dual-natured?”

Guanyu feigned ignorance, groaning, “Delirious from strain, surely... How long...?”

“Last push!” Shituo roared.

Agony spiked as Guanyu’s qi hemorrhaged. The sky blazed emerald—the forest now wholly restored.

As Allen praised their triumph, Guanyu’s eyes rolled back.

“He’ll recover with rest,” Shituo assured the sobbing Amy.

Yet his gaze lingered on Guanyu, sensing untold secrets within the youth...
