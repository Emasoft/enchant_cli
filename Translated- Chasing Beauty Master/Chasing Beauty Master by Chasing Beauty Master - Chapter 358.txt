“This was too sudden, too dangerous, too violent!”

The scene left Sun Mande’s companions stunned. However, after a brief moment, they snapped back to reality, glaring furiously at Guan Yu.

“How dare you hit someone? Is there no law anymore? Security! Where’s security?”

“Forget security—call the police! I have connections at the station. I’ll make him pay for his recklessness!”

...

Though Sun Mande’s friends seemed loyal enough, their clamoring accusations toward Guan Yu were all bark and no bite. None dared act. After all, the violent madman before them froze them with a single glare.

“Got a problem?” Guan Yu swept his gaze across the group, smiling coldly.

His smile, though bright, felt sinister to them. They glared resentfully but dared not speak.

“They’re fine. What about you?” Guan Yu turned to Li Xi, grinning.

This smile was genuinely warm.

**Chapter 901: Our Matter**

Li Xi stared at Guan Yu wordlessly. His brutality had been alarmingly direct, subjecting Sun Mande to extreme violence. Though harsh, the effect was undeniable—Sun Mande now lay groveling. Yet Li Xi realized the consequences: the Sun family’s retaliation would fall on her family. Still, she chose to trust Guan Yu.

“He’s definitely problematic,” Li Xi said, glancing at Sun Mande.

Guan Yu smirked. “If he’s not problematic, his brain must be!”

Sun Mande, nursing his injuries, seethed silently. When Guan Yu suddenly reappeared before him, grinning, terror gripped him.

“What… what do you want?” Sun Mande stammered.

Guan Yu’s fist answered. With a sickening crunch, Sun Mande collapsed again.

“Your brain’s definitely broken,” Guan Yu sneered, leaving Sun Mande confused and enraged.

“Bitch! You’re finished! Your family’s finished!” Sun Mande slurred, spittle flying.

Guan宇 waved dismissively. “Can’t you speak properly? If not, get lost!”

Turning to Li Xi, Guan宇 asked, “How should we handle this?”

“Your problem, you solve,” Li Xi replied coolly.

“Our problem,” Guan宇 corrected.

Li Xi rolled her eyes. “Your problem, you solve!”

Guan宇 groaned. Pulling out his phone, he barked, “Get your ass here! Teahouse Club!”

**Chapter 902: Troubles? Call the Lackey**

Soon, the door burst open. Jiang Ziqi entered, face bruised from yesterday’s beating. Behind him stood Xiao Dao, exuding lethal calmness.

“What do you want now?” Jiang Ziqi growled.

“Handle this idiot.” Guan宇 pointed at Sun Mande.

Jiang Ziqi glared. “You need me for this trash?”

**Chapter 903: Lackey, Step Aside**

Jiang Ziqi bristled at the insult but assessed Sun Mande—a low-tier brat posturing as elite. Disgusted, he snapped, “You need me for this trash?”

Guan宇 grinned. “Prove your worth, lackey. Earn your keep!”

Jiang Ziqi’s jaw tightened. Suppressing rage, he turned to Sun Mande. “You. Out. Now.”

Sun Mande’s arrogance crumbled under Jiang Ziqi’s icy glare. Trembling, he scrambled away. His cronies followed, defeated. The storm passed, leaving Guan宇 and Li Xi victorious—for now.
