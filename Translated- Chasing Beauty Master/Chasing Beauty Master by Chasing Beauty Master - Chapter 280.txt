“After finishing the kicking, Chen De walked up to Guan Yu and said with a mix of frustration and resentment, ‘I didn’t know this bastard caused such a huge mess. Since he wanted your life, we can’t let him off easily. According to the rules of the underworld, I’ll cripple his hands and feet. What do you think?’”

Guan Yu didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he glanced coldly at Luo Yuanquan, whose face had turned ashen, then turned to Li Ming—whose position was now awkward—and smiled. “Comrade Officer, how many years can someone get for attempted murder?”

“Huh?” Li Ming, now under Guan Yu’s scrutiny, panicked. Sweat beaded on his forehead. “Li Ming, answer the question!” Chen De urged, noticing Li Ming’s hesitation and realizing he too was implicated in offending this mysterious figure.

“Attempted murder... the sentence varies depending on circumstances,” Li Ming stammered.

“And in this case?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Years?” Li Ming’s eyelid twitched. He understood Guan Yu intended to use legal means to punish Luo Yuanquan but wasn’t sure how harsh to be. He glanced at Chen De, who subtly held up five fingers. “Under current circumstances... maybe five years.”

“Five years? Seems light,” Guan Yu mused.

Chen De raised two more fingers. “Seven years?” Li Ming ventured cautiously.

“Prisons aren’t my property. I can’t decide,” Guan Yu retorted.

Li Ming relented. “Given the severity, ten years seems appropriate.”

“I trust the police will enforce the law fairly,” Guan Yu finally smiled.

“I’ll report everything truthfully to my superiors,” Li Ming said solemnly.

“Good. I’ll be watching to ensure justice is served,” Guan Yu said pointedly.

Chen De paled. Ten years? But it was better than disappearing entirely.

Luo Yuanquan relaxed slightly—prison was preferable to death.

“Then take these two away,” Guan Yu ordered, pointing at Chen De and Luo Yuanquan.

Li Ming gaped.

**Chapter 709: Resolution**

Li Ming’s face twitched. Chen De had groveled, yet Guan Yu aimed to punish him too. “This has nothing to do with me!” Chen De pleaded.

“He’s your subordinate. You own Hengxin Real Estate. You’re responsible for its shoddy projects!” Guan Yu snapped.

“Shoddy projects? I earn honest money!” Chen De protested.

“Honest? Your ‘honest money’ nearly killed my father!” Guan Yu roared, kicking Chen De against the wall.

Chen De’s face darkened. He’d underestimated this young man’s power. Now, he was finished.

Guan宇 calmly called authorities. Soon, the mayor’s secretary, police chief, and a prosecutor arrived. Chen De was arrested for tax evasion, illegal construction, and organized crime.

**Chapter 710: Return**

Chen德’s empire crumbled. He’d underestimated Guan宇—a mistake that cost him everything.

After settling his father in a VIP ward, Guan宇 announced, “We’re returning to N City tomorrow. Dad, come with me. I’ll heal you there.”

关忠福 hesitated but agreed. The next day, they left—关宇’s journey back toN市 marked not just a physical return, but a transformation from a rural youth to a figure of unseen power.
