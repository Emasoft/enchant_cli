But neither was willing to abandon these delicious pastries, so the two girls were playing a finger-guessing game. Whoever lost would have to eat a piece, forcing their already full little bellies through this playful contest.

From afar, Duan Ruxue noticed these two distinctive maidens. Wang Xiaorong happened to be facing her direction, allowing Duan Ruxue immediate recognition of this unfamiliar beauty who undoubtedly belonged to Wan Hong (Vast Magnificence). The girl's appearance—from her flawless features to her graceful figure—made Duan Ruxue burn with envy. She had to concede defeat; this rival surpassed her in every aspect. How extraordinary that Young Master Wan Hong could attract such peerless jade-like companions!

The petite girl beside Wang Xiaorong also caught Duan Ruxue's attention. Though not recognizing her as Guan Yu's woman, she discerned the makings of a future great beauty beneath the girl's lingering shyness and youthful innocence.

Turning back, Duan Ruxue glanced at Wan Hong with complex emotions. Moments ago, she'd been blushing in his presence. Now discovering he already possessed such stunning women, she felt the bitter pang of missed opportunity. Had she encountered him earlier, perhaps she might now stand among his cherished companions.

She shook her head vigorously, bewildered by these uncharacteristic thoughts. Never before had her mind wandered so recklessly! Yet from their first meeting, Wan Hong's unassuming attire couldn't disguise his innate nobility—that effortless grace radiating from within, impossible to counterfeit. Duan Ruxue sensed this man would reshape the capital's destiny.

**Chapter 4862: Enemies**

Though the capital currently enjoyed calm waters, Duan Ruxue foresaw coming storms. Wan Hong's arrival would undoubtedly stir monumental changes. A twinge of melancholy gripped her—how unfortunate to meet this extraordinary man after others had already claimed his heart.

Her own marital prospects troubled her. Given her family's status, finding a suitable match proved difficult. Exceptional youths like Wan Hong were rare jewels even among the capital's elite. The only comparable candidate, Tang Muchen (Dustless Tang), repelled her with his disagreeable character.

"Ruxue, you've been hanging your head without a word for ages. What's on your mind?" Jiang Xin's question pierced her reverie.

"Oh, nothing important," Duan Ruxue recovered swiftly. "I was merely pondering recent events. The Vermilion Theater's feud with the Cao family intensifies, doesn't it? Wasn't Chu Fan's foot injury sustained during their retaliation?"

She continued, "The Cao clan's arrogance has long been tolerated. Yet I hear three of their major ventures—the gambling den, restaurant, and textile shop—were recently sabotaged. Have you heard details?"

"Only rumors of significant losses," Jiang Xin replied.

"Precisely!" Duan Ruxue's eyes gleamed. "Those establishments were cash cows. Such devastation would infuriate anyone. Since the culprit remains unidentified, the Caos will undoubtedly escalate hostilities."

Guan Yu interjected, "With their resources, shouldn't identifying perpetrators be simple?"

Duan Ruxue studied him. Though Wan Hong appeared ordinary, her instincts screamed otherwise. "The Caos assume their adversary possesses formidable power—likely one of the Four Great Families. They dismiss smaller enemies like the Vermilion Theater as incapable of such sophisticated strikes."

Chu Fan shot Guan Yu a meaningful glance. "If the Caos suspect powerful players, that shields us."

"Do you truly believe that, Young Master Wan?" Duan Ruxue countered. "When the Caos mobilize, the entire capital will tremble. Neither the Four Families nor your theater will escape unscathed."

She leaned forward. "Since events unfolded, we must face consequences. Wouldn't you agree?"

Guan Yu smiled serenely. "Indeed. Let them unleash their tempest. I'll stand guard before the Vermilion Theater, unimpressed by Cao bluster."

Though his words might seem bravado, Duan Ruxue sensed steel beneath. This man's calm assurance carried undeniable authority. Where others saw mere posturing, she perceived latent power.

**Chapter 4863: Preparations**

Duan Ruxue's suspicions crystallized. "Your capabilities remain hidden, Young Master Wan. Under your guidance, the Vermilion Theater could achieve greatness."

Guan Yu deflected, "I'm but an ordinary man with modest means."

"The Caos' ignorance mirrors your modesty," she pressed. Her blunt accusation made Chu Fan tense. Jiang Xin's eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Ruxue, are you suggesting Wan Hong engineered this?" Jiang Xin exclaimed.

"Lower your voice!" Chu Fan hissed. "This isn't child's play!"

Guan Yu sighed. "I neither confirm nor deny. However..." His gaze hardened. "The Caos attacked my friends. Their suffering pleases me."

Duan Ruxue nodded. "Recent adversaries matching both motive and means? Only you."

"Your perception does you credit," Guan Yu conceded.

Jiang Xin gasped. "Wan Hong! You actually—"

"Quiet!" Chu Fan interjected. "This isn't for public ears!"

"Apologies," Jiang Xin whispered, awestruck. "You never cease to amaze."

Duan Ruxue's eyes burned with admiration. "To strike the Caos so devastatingly... Your courage matches your prowess."

Guan Yu accepted the praise stoically. "I merely answer malice in kind."

**Chapter 4864: Admiration**

As discussions continued, Duan Ruxue's gaze never wavered from Guan Yu. Her sharp mind pieced together clues others missed. Though lacking proof, her instincts screamed truth. This unassuming young master held power to shake empires.

Jiang Xin teased, "Ruxue, you're smitten! Never seen you so talkative!"

"Don't jest!" Duan Ruxue flushed, though her eyes betrayed fascination.

Guan Yu diplomatically redirected: "Miss Duan's political acumen impresses me."

Cutting through pleasantries, Duan Ruxue demanded clarity. "Shall we speak frankly? I represent only myself here."

"By all means," Guan Yu inclined his head. Though her calculating gaze seemed incongruous on a young noblewoman, he detected no malice—merely shrewd curiosity.

"Let me be plain—the Caos' downfall serves your ascent. You've chosen formidable stepping stones."

Guan Yu's smile turned wolfish. "Should they overreach, their collapse will herald new hierarchies. The capital needs... restructuring."

Duan Ruxue shivered deliciously. Here stood ambition cloaked in silk—a dragon among minnows. Her earlier melancholy transformed into thrilling anticipation. This man's journey promised earthquakes, and she intended to witness every tremor.
