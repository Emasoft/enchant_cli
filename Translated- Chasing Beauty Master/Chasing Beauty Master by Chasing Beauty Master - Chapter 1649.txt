Xuanming pondered. If he were the Emperor, he might do the same. After all, the Crown Prince currently lacked substantial influence. Even if the Crown Prince produced evidence, no one would acknowledge it – indeed, most wouldn't even believe him capable of obtaining credible proof.

**Chapter 4306: Growing Strength**

Moreover, the Emperor wished to avoid provoking Second Prince's resentment through this matter. The Second Prince's faction wasn't to be trifled with – push them too far, and their cavalry rebellion could erupt beyond control.

The Emperor's current priority was rapidly building up the Crown Prince's stature, ensuring his authority became palpable within court circles. This would create genuine competition for the Second Prince. Future conflicts could then be framed as disputes between princes, allowing them to clash freely without immediately threatening the throne.

This strategy served as self-preservation. The Emperor knew full well about Consort Guifen's decades-long networking with court officials – strictly forbidden for any imperial concubine. Yet he'd turned a blind eye all these years precisely to keep the Second Prince apprehensive.

The Second Prince couldn't be allowed absolute dominance. He needed rivals – but not the Emperor himself – to check his ambitions. Otherwise, lawlessness would prevail.

However, with the Second Prince's faction growing daily in strength, the Emperor needed counterbalance. Hence Prince Zou's summoning. As an outsider arriving in the capital, Prince Zou's reputation could be elevated overnight through imperial favor.

Recent developments proved this plan effective. The Emperor successfully diverted the Second Prince's attention toward Prince Zou, buying precious breathing room.

Unexpectedly, the Crown Prince suddenly regained political awareness – an unforeseen boon. The Emperor decided to let both princes unite against their common rival.

While factionalism and political alliances were technically forbidden, the Emperor recognized their inevitability. So long as counterweights to the Second Prince existed, let them struggle – provided the conflict didn't reach the throne.

Xuanming pressed, “What happened next? How was the Shilie Sect discovered?”

“After investigating Minister Zhang's case, the elite troops brought news of the Crown Prince's eagerness to ally with Prince Zou. Naturally welcoming such partnership, Prince Zou resumed his journey under their escort.”

Guanyu continued, “We assumed the elite guard's protection – combined with the Imperial Guards and Embroidered Uniform Guard's recent crippling – made Prince Zou safe. We were wrong. Mere hours from the capital, our path was blocked.”

“The Shilie Sect intercepted you then?” Elder Lu interjected. “But even formidable cultivators wouldn't dare confront so many elite soldiers.”

“We encountered them, but not alone,” Guanyu explained. “Another group blocked the mountain pass ahead, shielding the Shilie cultivators behind. The narrow path flanked by cliffs trapped us. These human shields prevented our advance. Though I charged fiercely, I couldn't stop their rear forces from unleashing combined spells – terrifying fireballs incinerating everything below.”

“Undoubtedly the Shilie Sect,” Xuanming murmured. “Their signature fire magic – devastatingly powerful and theatrically grandiose.”

Guanyu nodded. “The spectacle demoralized us completely. The vanguard, though individually weak, included skilled fighters. They seemed bred as cannon fodder, mindlessly hindering our progress while protecting their mages.”

Xiao Zhi added, “We prepared to reveal our cultivation – knowing it would expose our identities – but saw no alternative after escorting Prince Zou so far.”

Elder Lu leaned forward. “Did you? What techniques did you use?”

“We didn't,” Guanyu shook his head. “At our darkest moment, their spell struck Prince Zou's carriage, reducing it and the horses to ashes. Many perished. As the human shields suffered heavy losses, they assumed Prince Zou dead and withdrew despite Shilie protests. Without their buffer, the cultists fled too.”

Xuanming stroked his beard. “Providential escape. Otherwise, you'd have faced annihilation or exposure.”

Elder Lu chuckled dryly. “Fortune favors fools. We heard the Emperor received Prince Zou personally at the palace gates.”

“Precisely.”

Xuanming smiled. “Such heavy losses, such prolonged strife – yet Prince Zou reached the capital alive. The Second Prince must've been livid.”

“Furious indeed,” Wang Jun laughed.

Elder Lu pressed, “Who were those human shields? No known faction serves the Second Prince.”

“Unknown,” Guanyu admitted. “But their disciples showed remarkable skill and numbers – likely a major power.”

Xuanming speculated, “Imperial Guards in disguise?”

“Impossible,” Guanyu countered. “They lacked military discipline. Both Embroiled Uniforms and Imperial Guards move with drilled precision. These were unruly – definitely not.”

**Chapter 4307: Ambition Unveiled**

“Puzzling,” Elder Lu mused. “But news of the Shilie Sect will spread. As a demonic cult, should we act first, Sect Leader?”

“Unnecessary,” Xuanming replied. “When word reaches the Demonic Soul Sect's Lord, he'll hunt them relentlessly. Let them clash while we observe. Our priority remains locating Miao City.”

“Then entrust this to Guanyu,” Elder Lu said. “Among Yunqing's younger generation, none else qualifies.”

“I'll undertake this,” Guanyu agreed. “But desert exploration requires aid. Even locating Miao City demands companions.”

Xuanming nodded. “Choose any disciples. You have until the fifteenth of seventh month – one month.”

“Has any Yunqing member desert experience?”

Elder Lu recalled, “Elder Dai once searched for herbs there. His disciple Siqi – found as a child during that trip – might retain knowledge.”

Guanyu's eyes lit up. “Let Siqi accompany me.”

Xuanming cautioned, “We must respect their choice. Desert travel risks life.”

“I'll consult Elder Dai,” Elder Lu offered.

As discussions continued, Xuanming mentioned crossbow production issues. Guanyu frowned. “Flaws in three of five? My design's simplicity leaves no room for error.”

**Chapter 4308: No Ordinary Man**

Xuanming sighed at Guanyu's nonchalance regarding the complex weapon.

Later, returning to his chambers, Guanyu bathed and changed. His gaze fell on the Swordless Manor token – marking him as its current lord. The manor's history of hundreds of martial-obsessed predecessors puzzled him. Unlike them, Guanyu wouldn't squander life studying wall carvings while sitting on vaulted treasures.

He chuckled imagining the fortune's modern equivalent. Tonight's rest preceded tomorrow's tasks – inspecting crossbows, preparing for the desert, and perhaps reuniting with Siqi. The desert's dangers paled beside the prospect of traveling with Yunqing's renowned beauty. Guanyu smiled – his path ever accompanied by remarkable women.
