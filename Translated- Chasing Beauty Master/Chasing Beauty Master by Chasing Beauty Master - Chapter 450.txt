“So it was an illusion! But this shadowy figure keeps intervening like this—could it be trying to help him? Who is it?” Guan Yu pondered carefully but couldn’t pinpoint anyone.

Having paused his pursuit, Guan Yu now realized the "Liao Yuntian" before him was merely a phantom. Yet as he stopped, he noticed the illusionary figure was paradoxically drawing closer—like a backward moonwalk, absurdly comical.

"Then... could Liao Yuntian end up behind me?"

Just as the phantom Liao Yuntian neared, something slammed into Guan Yu from behind, sending him flying. Thankfully, his reflexes saved him—a nimble twist mid-air and he landed steady.

Looking up, he froze. The real Liao Yuntian stood there, equal parts stunned and elated.

“Finally broke free!” Liao Yuntian exhaled. “I’ve been chasing you this whole time. The illusion must’ve shattered.”

Guan Yu gaped. Had Liao Yuntian also been ensnared?

**Chapter 1124: The Devil's Lair**

“You chasing me? Clearly, I was chasing you,” Guan Yu retorted.

Now composed, Liao Yuntian nodded. “Seems we both fell for the trick. Had you not halted, we might’ve chased each other endlessly.”

That explained why the car remained unaffected—the illusion only worked between their mutual pursuit.

“Why did you stop earlier?”

“Not sure,” Guan Yu shrugged, opting to keep the shadowy figure’s involvement secret. Though seemingly an ally, its ghastly appearance hinted at deeper ties he wasn’t ready to unravel.

Liao Yuntian studied him skeptically but pressed no further, resuming their silent race. The uneventful sprint ended at the teaching building’s base, Liao Yuntian half a step ahead—victory imminent.

If Liao Yuntian won, Guan Yu’s Golden Core stage cultivation would delay another ten days. As Wild Crane Daoist warned, the full moon’s optimal energy meant waiting another month.

In a burst of motion, Guan Yu lunged. Liao Yuntian barely dodged, their clash a flurry of muted strikes before resetting positions.

“I can’t let you win. You’re not ready,” Liao Yuntian stated firmly, wiping grime from his face.

“I know. That’s why my test is defeating you,” Guan Yu shot back, pride flaring. Though Zhou Xiaoyou deemed him supreme, he refused eternal second place. Three trials—he’d claim one.

“Then let’s duel properly.” Liao Yuntian assumed a combat stance, his form textbook-perfect compared to Guan Yu’s novice posture.

*Well, my expertise lies elsewhere...* Guan Yu smirked inwardly before tackling him outright.

Liao Yuntian, unprepared for such brawling, struggled to shake off the grapple. Both channeled spiritual energy—Guan Yu’s recent cultivation matching Liao’s seasoned power. Their inelegant tussle masked intricate counters.

After failed eye-gouges and groin strikes, Guan Yu backflipped free, landing a step from the building’s entrance. Liao Yuntian, veins bulging, charged—

—as space warped around them. Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. Was this one of Linchuan University’s rare loci for Earth Shrinking Art?

Channeling the spell, he vanished, reappearing atop the seventh floor. Liao Yuntian disappeared below, replaced by rows of darkened classrooms.

Success! Leaning over the railing, Guan Yu waved mockingly: “Hey! Up here, big bro! Come play!”

Liao Yuntian’s enraged glare fueled Guan Yu’s triumph—until shouts echoed. Before Guan Yu could react, figures materialized behind him: grinning devil cultivators with bloodred eyes.

Hairs stood on end. The entire floor glowed with their crimson gaze—no, the whole building pulsed with demonic light!

Trapped. Earth Shrinking Art failed—a trap? Guan Yu fought desperately, felling swathes, but numbers overwhelmed. Soon, three pinned him down.

“Kneel!” A devil cultivator kicked his legs.

Guan Yu buckled, then sprang upright: “I kneel only to heaven, earth, and corpses!”

The crowd parted for a towering leader—broad-shouldered, commanding. “So you cultivate immortality?”

Guan Yu sneered: “You harvest girls’ lives—call that cultivation? Admit you’re devils!”

“Sacrificing many to elevate few—is that not salvation?” the leader retorted.

“A black trade!” Guan Yu stalled, hoping for Liao Yuntian’s rescue—

—until the crowd revealed Liao Yuntian, captured.

“Choose,” the leader ground his heel into Liao’s skull. “Your friend dies, or the entire school?”

**Chapter 1125: Chonglou Wang Xiaojun**

Guan Yu gaped. His hoped-for savior now a hostage.

Countless devil cultivators infested the campus—they’d planned this. Outnumbered, Guan Yu’s mind raced.

Suddenly, he prostrated before the leader: “Trample me instead! Let this muscle-brained fool choose!”

“What?!” Liao Yuntian flushed. The leader raised an intrigued brow.

“Either choice damns me. I’ll be no executioner.” Guan Yu’s chest pressed against his hidden Demon Absorption Rod.

“I’ve a last letter here—deliver it posthumously?” he entreated.

As a minion reached in, the rod blazed forth, blinding all. The leader roared, lunging through radiance—

“Die, arrogant fool!” Guan Yu crowed, rod aloft.

The leader leaped from the seventh floor, his minions vanishing. Guan Yu stared—had it all been illusion?

Wild Crane Daoist and Wan Qingyang arrived. “Well done. You passed.”

“This... was all a test?”

“Indeed. Cultivating the Golden Core requires unshakable resolve. Tonight, you begin.”

Elated, Guan Yu shared news with Zhou Xiaoyou, basking in her praise.

Come dawn, refreshed from nascent cultivation, he entered class to find a robed youth meditating atop a desk—Wang Xiaojun of Heavy Sword Sect, Golden Core stage aura shimmering.

“You,” Wang Xiaojun rose, immense pressure dispersing gawkers.

“Heavy Sword Sect breaks seclusion?” Guan Yu demanded.

“For the Three Moons Duel,” Wang Xiaojun smiled shyly, drawing a colossal blunt sword. “You’re the mainland’s rising star.”

Guan Yu turned to leave.

“Wait!” Wang Xiaojun grabbed his sleeve, flustered.

“Let go or I’ll scream assault!”

Escaping, Guan Yu alerted Wild Crane. “The three sects move early—dragon Group’s plans must accelerate.”

Later, in martial arts class, Guan Yu’s dismissive attitude provoked instructor “Blade Sister” to challenge him.

**Chapter 1126: Versus Brother Bear**

“100 push-ups! Now!” Blade Sister ordered, cheeks flushed.

Guan Yu smirked. “These drills are beneath me.”

Infuriated, she challenged him to spar—

—but Guan Yu declined: “I don’t fight women.”

The class held its breath as tensions crackled...
