Guan Yu handed the silver notes to Xiao Tang and said, "Distribute these to everyone - fifty taels per person. Starting today, I'll give each person a fifty-tael silver note daily as gratitude for your assistance. How you spend it is your freedom."

Originally planning to distribute the notes tomorrow at departure to boost morale, Guan Yu decided to give them immediately when the burly man demanded his share early. Fifty taels per person meant 1,500 taels daily for thirty men. Though substantial, Guan Yu could afford this expenditure until reaching the Eastern Sea treasure.

Even Xiao Tang was astonished. Fifty taels daily per person represented extraordinary wealth - more than someone like him could possibly spend in a day. Though the silver reserves were considerable, Guan Yu's money pouch contained ample golden leaves. Each leaf could be exchanged for nearly a thousand taels of silver.

With the silver distributed, Guan Yu no longer concerned himself with whether it would be squandered or saved. After one final day awaiting Jiang Yuan's reinforcements from the capital, they would depart.

The next day confirmed Guan Yu's suspicions - Xiao Jiu, previously dispatched by Jiang Yuan, hadn't returned. Instead, Jiang Yuan's trusted agents from the Imperial Consort's residence arrived, arranged by the Princess through Jiang Yuan's correspondence.

For security and stealth, Guan Yu outlined his plan in Jiang Yuan's room: "Our combined forces must remain a secret. Tonight we depart. Xiao Rong will disguise Brother Jiang and Ruxue, including her maid. Frequent clothing changes will aid concealment."

"We'll exit through the inn's rear gate, circle Shuangzi City to lose pursuers before exiting. Xiao Tang will coordinate my men, Xiao Wu yours. The main group departs first while others follow discreetly."

Jiang Yuan nodded approval. "This should avoid many dangers."

By midnight, horses and carriages waited at the inn's back entrance. Though likely watched, Guan Yu had prepared a large carriage driven by Xiao Tang - a new face. Despite thorough disguises (including altered height), they circled the city multiple times before exiting.

After traversing woodland, the group transferred to Guan Yu's large carriage while Xiao Tang drove an empty decoy. Xiao Wu, now disguised, took over as driver. By next noon, they reached a densely populated town with multiple inns.

During lunch, Guan Yu remained vigilant but detected no threats. "Our route remains secret. Few could track us now," he observed.

Jiang Yuan suggested procuring warmer clothing as temperatures dropped northward. Qiqi suddenly tugged Guan Yu's sleeve, pointing at two fox demons entering the inn. Though initially suspicious, the pair showed no interest in them and soon departed.

Having escaped pursuers through elaborate maneuvers, the group prepared for increasingly desolate northern terrain. Duan Ruxue consulted her cloth map, directing them northward for a day before veering northeast past a large mountain.

At dawn, Wang Xiaorong labored to disguise the group while Guan Yu used self-taught transformation arts. Abandoning their old carriage, they acquired fresh horses and pressed northward into hilly badlands resembling desert fringes.

By afternoon, rugged terrain exhausted the horses. With no settlements in sight, they camped on rocky slopes devoid of vegetation. The bleak night echoed with beast calls, frightening the women into sharing tents.

At dawn, travel-weary but determined, the party pressed on. Half a day later, they reached Steamed Bun Mountain - a massive dome-shaped monolith of bare stone. Circumnavigating this landmark, they entered uneven plains where orientation became crucial.

That evening, camping in grassy terrain swarming with mosquitoes, Wang Xiaorong repelled insects with fragrant powder. Guan Yu inventoried provisions - sufficient for a week.

When questioned about their destination, Duan Ruxue revealed her map ended at Pagoda Mountain: "Beyond lies Eastern Sea territory where we must search independently."

That night, while others slept, Guan Yu's soul projection detected twenty-odd grey wolves approaching. Rousing the camp, he organized defenses as the pack encircled them.

The alpha wolf's howl orchestrated the encirclement. Guan Yu stood ready with his Falling Soul Blade, confident but vigilant. Wang Xiaorong erected a protective barrier as the wolves closed in, their coordinated tactics belying bestial nature...
