Guan Yu was speechless. This girl wasn’t stupid, so why couldn’t she grasp the implied meaning in his words? Too lazy to argue, he radioed for someone to retrieve Sun Yaoqi’s car while he took her back in the Ferrari.

Seeing Sun Yaoqi clinging tightly to Guan Yu, Dongfang Huowu’s face darkened as she muttered, “Shameless!”

Dongfang Mu frowned and scolded, “Watch your language! Can’t you act more ladylike?”

“Right, right—I’m not ladylike, but others are. Happy now?” Dongfang Huowu snapped unusually harshly, her temper flaring beyond her usual demeanor.

Realizing his tone had been too stern, Dongfang Mu softened. “Little Wu, I didn’t mean to criticize you. You dislike Sun Yaoqi, don’t you? Let me teach you a trick.”

“What trick?” Dongfang Huowu asked curiously.

“Copy Sun Yaoqi—go cling to Guan Yu’s arm!”

“Brother, what terrible advice!” Dongfang Huowu blushed furiously. The idea of mimicking Sun Yaoqi’s koala-like behavior repelled her.

“Little sister, you’re usually so clever—why act dense today?” Dongfang Mu adopted a tone of exasperation. “Think: if you loathe Sun Yaoqi, make her suffer. She’s clearly interested in Guan Yu. Steal him away, and you’ll prove your superiority. Even if you fail, you’ll still annoy her!”

Nearby, Jiang Ziqi silently applauded Dongfang Mu. He’d assumed the man was a dull artist devoid of cunning, never expecting such shrewdness. To coax his sister into pursuing Guan Yu—impressive!

Unbeknownst to Jiang, Dongfang Mu acted out of necessity. After Guan Yu’s previous visit, his parents had demanded he facilitate a match between Huowu and Guan Yu, threatening to veto his own romantic prospects otherwise.

**Chapter 1085: Recognizing You as a Sworn Brother**

For his happiness, even a blockhead like Dongfang Mu had to wise up. Moreover, his inherent cunning—usually hidden or neglected—surfaced. Regardless, his words ignited Huowu’s ambition.

*Yes! Since Sun Yaoqi monopolizes Guan Yu, she’d hate rivals. I’ll cling to him and provoke her!*

Huowu’s inner monologue masked her unacknowledged jealousy of Sun Yaoqi’s proximity to Guan Yu. Gritting her teeth, she forced a sweet smile and—egged on by her brother—approached Guan Yu with open arms.

Guan Yu, struggling to shake off his “koala,” gaped as Huowu sidled up, cooing, “Guan Yu, are you tired? Let me massage you!”

*Tired? From a fifteen-minute drive?* Suspicion flashed in his eyes. “What scheme are you plotting now?”

Huowu seethed. Her genuine concern met accusations? Unbearable! She nearly released him but swallowed her rage, simpering, “No schemes! I just worry about you!”

Guan Yu grew warier. This mischievous girl—suddenly kind?

Meanwhile, Sun Yaoqi recovered from her fright and glared at Huowu. “Dongfang Huowu! What are you doing?!”

Thrilled by her rival’s anger, Huowu smirked. “Why can’t I hold him if you can?”

“He’s *my* man! You’ve no right!”

Guan Yu nearly choked. *Since when?!*

“*Your* man? Is his face branded? He’s my… *teacher*! I’ll hug my teacher as I please!” Huowu barely avoided calling him “my man,” saving face.

“I claimed him first! Let go!”

“Make me!”

Bystanders envied Guan Yu’s dilemma, but he found the squabble irritating. Shaking both girls off, he snapped, “Enough! Quiet!”

“Guan Yu-gege, are you angry?” Sun Yaoqi pouted tearfully.

Huowu gloated silently. *Serves you right!*

“Listen—I have a girlfriend. I’m *not* your man. The race is over. I’m leaving.”

Guan Yu’s headache worsened. Escaping this little devil seemed wise.

“Wait! You haven’t claimed your wager!”

Sun Yaoqi, awed by his heroism, refused to let him go.

Guan Yu sighed. “What wager?”

“If you won, I’d be your maid for a month.” Her cheeks flushed at admitting servitude.

“Forget it. Racing’s too dangerous—quit it.”

“I will!” After nearly dying, she’d never race again. “But a real man honors bets. I’ll serve you for a month!”

“No! I object!” Huowu interjected. Under puzzled stares, she stammered, “He’s sworn brothers with my elder brother! Bringing a maid to our house would be improper!”

The flimsy excuse amused Guan Yu. Dongfang Mu coughed. “She’s right. Maids are outdated. This could cause misunderstandings.”

Apologizing inwardly to Sun Yaoqi, Dongfang Mu pressed, “Send her home.”

Guan Yu agreed. “Go. Your parents will worry.”

“They’re in Hainan and Taiwan—too busy.” Sun Yaoqi’s momentary sadness vanished. “Be my sworn brother instead!”

*Not bad.* Guan Yu, fond of the unruly girl, nodded. “Fine. But obey me—go home now!”

Delighted, Sun Yaoqi kissed his cheek. “I’ll visit tomorrow!”

As Guan Yu touched the lingering warmth, Huowu sneered, “Miss your ‘sister’? Chase her!”

“None of your business. I won your race—remember your promise. Disobey, and…” He raised a threatening palm.

**Chapter 1086: The Final Assault Begins**

Huowu instinctively covered her rear, glared, and fled.

Returning past midnight, Guan Yu found Wen Qing’s household asleep. He draped a blanket over himself and dozed on the sofa.

Dawn brought Lin Dong’s call. “Guan Yu—the Song family’s attacking!”

The Songs, politically astute, had monitored Guan Yu’s leisure amid their schemes. With the Li family retreating and international troubles mounting, they resolved to crush him now.

Their offensive struck multiple fronts: stirring dissent in N City’s gangs, crippling Guan Yu’s companies via Chen Lin’s betrayal, and pressuring allied families in the capital. The Tangs, as business-focused, suffered most.

By morning, Tang Siming arrived grim-faced, followed by Dongfang Mu, Wang Dahu, Jiang Ziqi, Li Xi, Feng Tang, and Chen Shu.

“What’s our move?” Dongfang Mu asked. Though resisting, he lacked strength to aid others.

Wang Dahu declared, “My father says: follow your lead!” Jiang Ziqi added, “My grandfather’s contacts will assist.” Li Xi stated, “My father’s full support.”

The Feng and Chen families pledged their remnants. Wen Baoguo growled, “Speak, boy!”

Guan Yu lounged, tapping the sofa. “Waiting for a call.”

As if summoned, his phone rang. “Done,” the voice said.

“Good.”

He dialed again. “Uncle Jiang—proceed.”

A third call: “Move.”

Baffled, the group demanded explanations.

“Apologies for secrecy earlier. Now—counterattack freely.”

“Yes!” Wang Dahu leaped up. Others nodded, eager to avenge their losses.

Guan Yu met Tang Xiao at the trade center. “How’d you make the Songs retreat?”

Tang Xiao smiled cryptically. “Let me keep secrets awhile. I’ll explain post-victory.”

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. “Ensure your methods don’t displease me.”

“Never betray you, sir.”

“Loyalty’s about price. Let’s visit the Songs.”

Outside, blue skies belied the capital’s turmoil. Neutral families now chose sides—except the Crown Prince, who called Guan Yu: “Need help? Just ask.”

**Chapter 1087: To the Song Residence**

The Song-Guan conflict erupted fully, dragging neutrals into the storm. Many would fall; survivors would bleed.

The Crown Prince, rejecting Song’s overtures, phoned Guan Yu. Li Yu gaped as he said, “I’m here if needed.”
