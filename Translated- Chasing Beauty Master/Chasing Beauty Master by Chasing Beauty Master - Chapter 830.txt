Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred and Twenty-Five: The Madwoman

“You’ll need a Nascent Soul Relic or a Myriad-Year Demonic Domain, combined with the blood of the Demon Imperial Clan,” Jin Hua said leisurely. Guan Yu furrowed his brow and sighed. “You’re teasing me again. How is this ‘not too difficult’? Where would we even get the blood of the Demon Imperial Clan?”

Jin Hua chuckled. “Zhang Han herself is of the Demon Imperial Clan.”

“So if we obtain the Feng family’s Myriad-Year Demonic Domain, we can break the seal on Zhang Han?” Guan Yu exclaimed in surprise. “And she’s not just a demon—she’s from the Demon Imperial Clan?”

“If the records aren’t mistaken, yes. It states that only a member of the Demon Imperial Clan can cast such a sealing spell. Ordinary seals couldn’t suppress a royal demon for so many years, nor would they be so hard to undo. This means Zhang Han’s mother must have been of the Demon Imperial Clan, and thus, so is she.”

Listening to Jin Hua’s explanation, Guan Yu struggled to reconcile the image of sweet, innocent Zhang Han with the terrifying notion of her being a royal demon. “What will happen to her once the seal is lifted?”

Jin Hua smiled knowingly, aware of his worries. She patted his shoulder. “Don’t fret. Even unsealed, her appearance won’t change. Her father was human, so her outer form remains human. The only shift might be her temperament, as decades of sealed memories flood her mind.”

Guan Yu understood. Anyone confronted with such a deluge of suppressed memories would be profoundly altered. Only the strong-willed could endure without breaking.

“The Feng family’s Myriad-Year Demonic Domain…” he muttered to himself.

Jin Hua added, “According to demonic texts, when a Nascent Soul Peak expert dies, they leave behind a stone called the Myriad-Year Demonic Domain. Legends claim it can resurrect the dead. Humans refer to it as a Nascent Soul Relic. I suspect the Fengs’ treasure is precisely such a relic.”

Finally, it clicked. The fabled Myriad-Year Demonic Domain was a Nascent Soul Relic—a treasure potent enough to either cure Patriarch Qing’s serpent venom or shatter Zhang Han’s seal. But acquiring it from the heavily guarded Feng estate posed a monumental challenge.

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu and Jin Hua, the seal within Guan Yu himself—also cast with royal demonic magic—could be undone by absorbing a Nascent Soul Relic, restoring his sealed memories and cultivation. Had he consumed the relic he’d previously obtained, his current life with Yang Conghan, Jin Hua, and Zhang Han would never have unfolded.

“Do you have a plan to secure the Fengs’ relic?” Guan Yu asked, trusting Jin Hua’s cunning.

She shook her head. “I’m a fugitive now, weak and confined. Unless I seduce Young Master Feng, there’s little I can do.”

“Absolutely not!” Guan Yu cut in sharply. He’d sooner beg on the streets than let his woman debase herself.

“The Feng compound appears ordinary, but their defenses are tight. Too many guards, even if they’re incompetents,” he grumbled.

“Perhaps…” Jin Hua hesitated, piquing his curiosity.

Under his expectant gaze, she suggested, “Target Feng Xihu.” Guan Yu shot to his feet. “No! I won’t go near that madwoman!”

“She’s a famed beauty, albeit temperamental. But she’s our best avenue.”

Guan Yu shook his head vehemently. “I’d rather leave Zhang Han sealed forever than use Feng Xihu! And what then—pretend to love her after stealing the relic? Unthinkable!”

Jin Hua laughed at his vehemence. “Calm down! It was merely a suggestion. I’m sure you’ll find another way.” Privately, she hoped for swift success: an unsealed Zhang Han, empowered by royal blood, would be a formidable ally against their shared enemies—the Four Great Clans who’d destroyed Jin Hua’s family.

Yet Guan Yu dreaded that day. Caught between Jin Hua, Zhang Han, and the Yang family, how could he mediate? Until he found a path satisfying all, the relic must remain untouched.

“I’ll help you, Jin Hua—when the time is right,” he vowed earnestly.

“I trust you,” she replied, masking her impatience. Revenge could wait.

Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred and Twenty-Six: The Mysterious Pet

Abandoning the relic dilemma, Guan Yu turned to news of Qing Ling’er’s father. Wei Hongwei had bought a pet—a venomous green snake—to conquer his ophidiophobia.

The half-meter serpent, no thicker than a thumb, ranked among Earth’s deadliest. Intrigued, Guan Yu discovered the snake breeder was none other than Ling’er’s parents in their remote village.

Everything clicked: Ling’er’s cured poison, her father’s absence from famed forests… She’d protected him by lying. The betrayal stung, but Guan Yu visited regardless.

Their cottage nestled at a mountain’s foot, surrounded by woods. The yard reeked of snakes, dozens coiled under tarps. Finding the house empty, Guan Yu called out, “Uncle Qing? Auntie Qing? It’s Guan Yu!”

The door creaked open. Madame Qing greeted him coolly but invited him in. Guan Yu presented gifts: a massive serpent gallbladder for her husband and a precious wild ginseng.

“This is too much!” she protested until he invoked Ling’er’s name.

As they chatted about country life’s simplicity, Guan Yu noted the new timber construction and absence of her husband. Before he could inquire, a figure emerged from the back room—Qing Ling’er’s father, alive and well.

Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred and Twenty-Seven: The Visit

The cottage’s rustic interior held handmade furniture and the scent of fresh wood. Madame Qing fretted over the ginseng’s cost until Guan Yu assured her it was his gift, not Ling’er’s.

“City life doesn’t suit me,” she said, though finances likely played a role. Here, they grew their food, needing little money.

When Guan Yu opened the second box, the stench of preserved serpent gallbladder filled the room. Madame Qing’s eyes widened—this was the cure her husband needed.

As Guan Yu pressed about Ling’er’s secrecy, footsteps approached from outside. The door swung open, revealing Qing Ling’er herself, frozen in shock at the unexpected visitor holding the key to her family’s salvation—and confronting their deception.
