Pushing open the door, Guan Yu froze in astonishment! Feng Xin lay curled up clutching her blanket, sleeping soundly. Her earlier response must have been a drowsy murmur.

The woman's nightgown had ridden up to her waist during restless sleep, exposing a creamy thigh resting atop the covers. The rounded curve of her hips formed an alluring silhouette that seemed to beckon involuntarily. Gulping audibly, the young man stood transfixed in the doorway, uncertainty paralyzing his limbs.

His gaze lingered on the black lace panties peeking beneath the rumpled hem. Who would have imagined this ice-cold tomboy possessed such secretly sensual tastes? The sight proved devastatingly tempting. Even in slumber, the delicate femininity of her peach-hued nightdress evoked tender protectiveness – a pity her abrasive personality shattered all charm.

The full moons of her buttocks faced him unabashedly, the intimate cleft between clearly visible through flimsy fabric. Guan Yu's throat tightened as he discerned the plump contours of her nether lips, the tantalizing crevice they guarded. A primal hunger ignited in his veins, blood roaring like wildfire through his body.

He couldn't linger – already he felt his self-control crumbling. Yet rousing her now would mean facing those furious eyes after she discovered her exposure. Steeling himself, he crept toward the bed, close enough to touch the exposed thigh with outstretched fingers.

Conscience warred with desire. "Taking advantage of a sleeping woman is despicable," he admonished himself silently. Resolving to merely adjust her hem, he reached trembling fingers toward the wayward fabric.

Just as his fingertips brushed the nightgown's edge, Feng Xin stirred with a sleepy murmur. Rolling onto her back, her hips trapped his hand beneath their warm weight. Guan Yu's eyes widened in panic – withdrawing now would surely wake her.

The intimate view from this new angle stole his breath. Through the translucent lace, dark curls beckoned like forbidden fruit. A heady feminine musk filled his nostrils, paradoxically calming his frayed nerves even as it stoked deeper yearnings.

Slowly, agonizingly, he attempted to tug the hem downward with his free hand. Each inch of concealed flesh felt like losing precious treasure. The shadowy view from beneath the nightdress's hem taunted him with glimpses of paradise.

"Beast!" He bit his tongue sharply, the pain grounding him. How could he – a chaste virgin – debase himself like this? Forcing his gaze away, he wrestled with the immediate problem: extricating his trapped hand without detection.

As if sensing his dilemma, Feng Xin shifted again. The supple flesh beneath his palm quivered like fresh mochi, sending delicious tremors up his arm. Just as Guan Yu began savoring this illicit contact, the sleeping beauty abruptly yanked his arm free, nearly pulling him onto the bed.

Their eyes met in stunned silence when Feng Xin's lashes fluttered open. "What are you doing here?" she demanded hoarsely, shoving his arm away.

Relief flooded Guan Yu. "I came to wake you for dinner—" he began, but Feng Xin's delayed realization struck like lightning.

"PERVERT!" Her shriek pierced the air as feet slammed into his chest, sending him sprawling. Scrambling upright, Guan Yu faced a storm of enraged pillows and incoherent shouting.

"I swear it was an accident!" he pleaded, backpedaling as Feng欣 sat up furiously. "Your blanket fell, I tried to—"

"Liar!" She lunged, teeth sinking into his forearm with feral intensity. Guan Yu stifled a howl, enduring the punishment as crimson bloomed beneath pearly incisors.

When she finally released him, both trembled – he from pain, she from impotent fury. "Get out!" Feng Xin hissed, cheeks aflame. "I never want to see your face again!"

Stung by injustice, Guan Yu turned sharply. "Fine! I'll repay every cent and vanish!"

"Wait!" The cry escaped before she could stop it. Pride warred with unspoken regret as she grabbed his sleeve. "You... you can't leave yet! The money—"

"Take my ID, phone, everything as collateral!" he snapped, wrenching free. "Or keep the clothes off my back if it pleases you!"

Their eyes locked in furious stalemate. Finally, Feng Xin retreated with a disdainful sniff. "Go then! See if I care!"

The slammed door echoed through the mansion. Downstairs, Master Feng raised an eyebrow at his granddaughter's empty chair and the youth's stormy exit. Chopsticks hovered momentarily before resuming their rhythmic click against porcelain. Young hearts, he mused, required their own strange dances.
