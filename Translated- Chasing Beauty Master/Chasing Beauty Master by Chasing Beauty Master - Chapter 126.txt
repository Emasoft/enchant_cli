“Heh… Big Bro, I didn’t mean to bring this up, but you’re being too absolute! Saying you’d never take free offerings—yet didn’t you end up with that girl? Besides, are you so sure Senior Xiaojuan and Sister Xin have never been to bars? Does that make them bad women?” Niu Le grew emboldened as Guan Yu fell speechless, firing questions rapid-fire.

“Enough nonsense!” Guan Yu’s ears flushed as he shot Niu Le an annoyed glare.

“Regular bar-hoppers are never decent folk. If you want romance or girlfriends, follow my lead! Our school’s overflowing with beauties—take your pick!” Guan Yu declared solemnly.

Niu Le pouted. “Come off it… Which girl here would glance at me? They all want rich, handsome guys with connections.” He hung his head shamefully.

Guan Yu glared. “Nonsense! I’m Student Union President now! Tomorrow I’ll assign you to manage female dorms and discipline. Proximity breeds opportunity—don’t you get it? With my help, you’ll have chances to get close!” He winked conspiratorially.

“Really?” Niu Le’s face blossomed into a grin stretching ear-to-ear.

“Deal’s set! Don’t worry—I’ll handle any obstacles.”

Thus, Guan Yu successfully steered Niu Le back onto the academic path.

Next morning, Feng Xin drove them to campus. Before exiting, she turned to Guan Yu: “I’ve unexpected business tonight—take a taxi home.”

“Another late night?” He arched an eyebrow.

“Perhaps… Recent troubles multiply.” She flicked her long hair wearily.

Nodding thoughtfully, Guan Yu watched her drive off, lips pressed tight. This woman single-handedly managed vast family enterprises—her exhaustion palpable. Yet what could he do? His own entrepreneurial dreams remained illusory bubbles. Only after selling the red jadeite for startup funds could things begin. Until then—mundane student life.

All morning, the professor’s lectures washed over him. Feng Xin’s haggard expression haunted his thoughts. Time to accelerate plans—check the jadeite’s status, secure more capital, build strength to protect loved ones. But beyond gem gambling and clairvoyant tricks, what avenues existed?

“Guan Yu…”

The class stared as he remained obliviously chin-propped, gazing窗外.

“GUAN YU!”

Niu Le’s slap jolted him awake.

“Huh? Oh… Professor Liu, you called?” He stood blankly.

“The Dean summons you—Student Union meeting.”

As Guan Yu left, classmates buzzed:

“Why’s a freshman called to Union meetings? Don’t recruits need screenings?”

“Unfair! Did he skip the process?”

Their complaints halted when Guan Yu abruptly returned.

“Niu Le, Haozhi, Wang Zhen—come.” He beckoned casually.

The trio gaped. “Why us?”

“Getting you positions. Weren’t you building campus influence? Titles first!” Guan Yu shrugged.

In the Dean’s office, the portly administrator rose eagerly: “Ah, Guan Yu! Today’s meeting announces your Presidency. Remember—no modesty before the veterans!”

Clearly anticipating backlash from ousted upperclassmen, the Dean sweated nervously. Spotting Guan Yu’s entourage, he blinked: “And these…?”

“Future Union officers. Their excellence merits inclusion.” Guan Yu presented the trio whose terse self-introductions—“Niu Le,” “Wang Zhen,” “Tian Hao”—left the Dean speechless.

The procession entered the conference room where current Union members chatted. Center-stage sat Xu Wei—the poised incumbent President. But Guan Yu’s attention snagged on a familiar face—Wang Yang, the “hotel rendezvous” lad from earlier chapters, now cringing invisibility spells.

Grinning, Guan Yu waved. Wang Yang palmed his face—his secret now hostage.

After the Dean’s awkward announcement, Xu Wei erupted: “This is outrageous! Our Union functions smoothly! We reject this—”

“The school’s decision stands,” the Dean interjected weakly before retreating.

Guan Yu scanned challengers: “Others objecting?”

Three hands rose. Xu Wei turned to Vice-President Wang Yang: “Your stance?”

“Full support!” Wang Yang bowed obsequiously—earning Xu Wei’s betrayed glare.

Next, all eyes turned to温情—the blushing female Vice-President staring oddly at Guan Yu.

“Miss Wen?”

She averted gaze: “I… accept any school decision.”

Xu Wei’s faction crumbled. Guan Yu strolled to the head table, looming over the seething ex-President:

“Discussion time’s over. My chair, if you please.”

As Xu Wei僵持, Guan Yu leaned close: “Stay seated if you like. Makes no difference.”

With that, he claimed dominion over the Union—entourage in tow—as new campus power dynamics crystallized.
