“You must be joking. Who would dare steal the artifact of the Right Envoy of the Demonic Soul Sect? That would be courting death.” Guan Yu replied with a helpless expression. “You’re mistaken. This isn’t Aunt Right Envoy’s Soul-Devouring Whip. It’s another one—the Spirit-Devouring Whip, which forms a pair with her artifact.”

“The Spirit-Devouring Whip? Could this be the one from back then…” Wang Xiaorong’s words trailed off, unspoken.

Staring at the Spirit-Devouring Whip on the table, the Right Envoy clenched her fists tightly, her face visibly agitated. She gazed at it unblinkingly before asking, “Where did you obtain this Spirit-Devouring Whip?”

Her tone was icy. Guan Yu answered truthfully, “From Xuan Ming, of course. Most of the treasures I possess or have gifted others were acquired from him.”

“It seems you truly are Xuan Ming’s most favored disciple. Such a precious artifact was simply given to you.” Though her voice remained flat, Guan Yu noticed tears glistening in her eyes under the candlelight.

The Right Envoy continued, “You’re correct. This is indeed his artifact.” She then placed her own Soul-Devouring Whip on the table.

“Wow, they look identical!” Qiqi exclaimed in surprise.

“They are a pair, but not identical,” the Right Envoy explained. “The difference lies at the tip. The Spirit-Devouring Whip has three daggers, while the Soul-Devouring Whip has only one.”

In truth, the differences extended further. The Spirit-Devouring Whip was slightly longer, though otherwise nearly the same.

Guan Yu chuckled, “Don’t laugh, Aunt Right Envoy. I traded an immortal artifact for this.”

“An *immortal artifact*?” The Right Envoy’s eyes widened. Even she was startled by the mention.

“If anyone else claimed to trade an immortal artifact, I’d doubt them. But coming from you, Guan Yu, I believe it.” She nodded slowly.

“It’s true,” Guan Yu elaborated. “During my visit to the Swordless Manor, I stumbled upon an object—a curious, beautiful orb I kept as a trinket. Later, the Cloud Azure Sect’s elders confirmed it was indeed an immortal artifact. However, its powerful artifact spirit refused to acknowledge someone as insignificant as me, rendering it unusable. When Xuan Ming learned of it, he desired it fervently. Naturally, I didn’t hand it over freely. In exchange, he gave me several artifacts, including this Spirit-Devouring Whip. At first, I was shocked to see a twin to your whip. Chief Lu later explained they were a matched pair.”

The Right Envoy murmured, “For years, I searched for this Spirit-Devouring Whip. Yet all this time, it lay in Xuan Ming’s possession. Strange… When I slew that scoundrel, his artifact wasn’t with him. How did it reach Xuan Ming?”

The truth was complex. The whip hadn’t been obtained by Xuan Ming directly, but by Chief Xiang—then merely a promising disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect. He discovered it while herb-gathering in remote mountains. Though he tried wielding it, the weapon never suited him. Later, to secure his promotion to chief, he gifted it to Xuan Ming. Thus, the age-old logic held: climbing ranks required generous offerings.

Guan Yu added gently, “After obtaining this, I knew it paired with your whip. I wished to gift it sooner but feared stirring painful memories. I worried its presence might deepen your sorrow. But if you’re ready, Aunt Right Envoy, please accept it now.”

“You’d give this to me?” Her surprise was palpable.

Moments earlier, she’d thought merely seeing it again sufficed. Never had she imagined Guan Yu would offer such a priceless treasure—a top-grade artifact adorned with rare black gemstones, its value immeasurable. Such casual generosity could only come from Guan Yu himself. Had another made the offer, she’d have deemed it mockery. Yet now, her dilemma lay in finding a worthy reciprocal gift, though nothing she carried could match its worth. Still, refusing this long-sought treasure proved equally unthinkable.

**Chapter 5093: The Stubborn Old Man**

Noticing her hesitation, Guan Yu asked, “Is there difficulty, Aunt Right Envoy? I offer this freely, with no ulterior motives. Accept it as you will—no coercion. If preferred, I could entrust it to Xiaorong for your retrieval.”

“You’ve considered this deeply.” The Right Envoy’s expression softened. “You misunderstand. This artifact’s value is immense—countless in the martial world crave it. While I desire it, accepting such a gift without reciprocation shames me. I ponder what I might offer in return.”

“Ah, that’s all?” Guan Yu relaxed. Wang Xiaorong chimed in, “Aunt Right Envoy, don’t stand on ceremony. This whip serves you best—accept it without fuss.”

With a sigh, the Right Envoy lifted the artifact. “True, I’ve needed this for years.” Her private struggles were known only to herself—decades spent at a cultivation bottleneck, unable to progress despite the Demonic Sovereign’s aid. Her retreat into seclusion proved equally futile. Two factors hindered her: unresolved past traumas and inadequate artifacts. A paired weapon like this might finally catalyze her breakthrough.

Yet hesitation lingered. Guan Yu, an outsider from the Cloud Azure Sect, gifting such treasure complicated matters. But with her cultivation stagnant, the temptation proved irresistible.

Wang Xiaorong decisively gathered both whips. “Take them. Consider it my gift if that eases your mind.”

“Very well. I’ll accept.” The Right Envoy sighed. “Unlike you, Guan Yu, I lack abundant treasures. But know this—I owe you a debt for this supreme artifact.”

“No debt exists,” Guan Yu smiled. “If you insist, attribute it to Xiaorong.”

As he spoke, several figures entered the teahouse. The Right Envoy nodded subtly. “Those are the ones tailing me earlier. Recognize any?”

Guan Yu observed the quartet—cultivators, but unfamiliar. None bore Cloud Azure Sect insignia, likely minor faction members. “They’re no match for you. Why track you?”

“The martial world shifts,” the Right Envoy replied, sipping tea. “You may not know—Sun Lianzi of the Crimson Lotus Sect is recruiting minor sects with lavish promises. Officially, they claim to unite against demonic forces. In truth…”

“They’re building cannon fodder for the Eastern Sea treasure hunt!” Guan Yu interjected. “Sacrificing outsiders to preserve their own strength. Cunning indeed.”

Wang Xiaorong frowned. “Why don’t other sects follow suit? The Cloud Azure Sect could attract more allies than the Crimson Lotus.”

“Xuan Ming’s too stubborn,” Guan Yu scoffed. “He’d never compromise sect dignity, even if it costs lives.”

“Precisely,” the Right Envoy agreed. “To him, face outweighs practicality. Cloud Azure will bleed alone rather than seek help.”

Qiqi snorted, “What use is pride? The Crimson Lotus method is smarter—let others die for their gain.”

“Xuan Ming’s obstinacy will be Cloud Azure’s downfall,” Guan Yu concurred. Changing tack, he asked, “Why not eliminate those trackers?”

“Killing them solves nothing—others would replace them. Better to trace their master.” Her expression darkened. “The Demonic Sovereign mobilizes our sect in full force for the Eastern Sea treasure. You must prioritize survival, Guan Yu.”

He nodded grimly. “I’ll avoid sect conflicts. My goal isn’t treasure, but…” He hesitated, then disclosed, “The next fragment of the Eight-Sided Drum technique. The clue—‘Boundless seas, valley at world’s edge, dragon pearl’s treasure, divine arts fill the city’—points east.”

**Chapter 5094: Personal Intervention**

“You obtained a fragment at the Golden Hall?” the Right Envoy probed.

Meeting Wang Xiaorong’s gaze, Guan Yu admitted, “Yes, absorbed into the Imperial Seal. Left Envoy arrived too late to witness it.”

She nodded—this secret she’d kept from the Demonic Sovereign, who’d once inspected Guan Yu without detecting it. Exposure would have meant dire consequences.

Wang Xiaorong whispered urgently, “Please keep this hidden, even from Father.”

Before the Right Envoy could reply, the atmosphere shifted. Four cultivators lingered conspicuously near their table. Guan Yu assessed them—unremarkable, likely pawns in a larger game.

The Right Envoy’s voice lowered. “The Crimson Lotus’s mobilization is but a prelude. Our sect moves in full strength—the Demonic Sovereign himself leads this charge. Blood will drown the Eastern Sea.”

Wang Xiaorong paled. Guan Yu squeezed her hand. “I seek no treasure—only the technique. Wealth means nothing to me.”

“Then our paths needn’t clash.” The Right Envoy stood, twin whips gleaming. “But remember—when tides of war rise, survival trumps honor.” With that, she melted into the shadows, leaving the trackers scrambling after her.

Guan Yu watched them go, murmuring, “The stubborn old man’s pride versus the cunning schemer’s ambition… This hunt may forge new legends—or graves.”
