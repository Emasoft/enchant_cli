“There’s nothing unusual on the computer screen,” the policewoman remarked in fluent Mandarin. “Mr. Guan Yunchang, may I ask if your visit to East Island is for tourism or family matters?”

Guan Yu couldn’t help but silently admire her. Her Mandarin was even more polished than his own. If not for knowing her identity, he might have mistaken her for a native Chinese girl.

Hearing the name “Guan Yunchang,” Guan Yu inwardly grumbled about the Long Group’s current leader, Ning Zhan, and the team responsible for forging his documents. Playing on the homophonic resemblance of his real name, Guan Yu (关羽), they had directly adapted it to “Guan Yunchang” (管云长) for his passport. Any astute observer could easily trace the connection.

Though aware her questions were routine, Guan Yu smirked and teased her: “I’m here as a tourist, but since it’s my first visit, I’m utterly unfamiliar with the area. Might I interest you in being my guide, miss?”

The security guard watching Guan Yu shamelessly flirt with the policewoman cursed inwardly: *Stupid Chinese. Seeing Officer Sakurako’s beauty, he’s already dreaming. Let’s see if she puts him in his place.*

Takagi Sakurako, though merely an officer at the local precinct, was the daughter of Takagi Hyakumasa, chairman of Takagi Telecommunications—Hujō City’s largest conglomerate. Coldly aloof, she had rebuffed countless suitors from East Island’s elite. Yet this Chinese man dared to cozy up to her upon their first meeting.

To the guard’s astonishment, Takagi Sakurako lifted her head and smiled faintly at Guan Yu. “Mr. Guan, I’m currently on duty.”

Guan Yu sensed an intense aura from her—unlike that of mutants or pseudo-psychics—which piqued his curiosity. Combined with his weakness for beauty, he’d ventured the flirtation. Unexpectedly, despite her frosty demeanor, she regarded him favorably.

Unbeknownst to him, his current power surpassed anyone on Earth. His spiritual sense, overwhelmingly potent, had subtly influenced Sakurako the moment he entered the room, fostering an inexplicable fondness within her.

Many nations derided East Island as “The Dwarf Country” due to its historically short-statured men. Recent national campaigns to shed this stigma through physical enhancement had slightly improved averages, yet Chinese men remained far more appealing to East Island women.

At twenty-two, Takagi Sakurako had coldly dismissed countless local suitors. Though puzzled by her sudden attraction to Guan Yu, she found herself eager to deepen their acquaintance.

With a smile, Guan Yu placed a business card on the table. “How about this, miss? Here’s my contact. After your shift, we’ll dine together and tour Hujō. I’ll pay your guide fee. By the way, may I know your name…?”

Under the guard’s stunned gaze, Sakurako not only accepted the card but stood to bow. “Mr. Guan, I’m Takagi Sakurako. Pleased to make your acquaintance. My shift ends at five. I’ll call you then.”

Though Sakurako’s favor was evident, Guan Yu discovered foreign energies clinging to him upon leaving the security office—800.

Having maintained his spiritual sense throughout the encounter, he confirmed neither Sakurako nor the guard had tampered with him. These foreign traces weren’t physical objects but resembled energy rays.

He deduced they originated from hidden devices in the doorway. While easily erasable, removing them would alert observers, complicating his mission.

Exiting, the receptionist processed his check-in without fuss. Settling into Room 2035, Guan Yu admired the cityscape from the twentieth floor. Despite Chinese criticisms of East Island, its efficient land use—dense high-rises and bustling streets—earned his reluctant admiration.

Perhaps their island nation’s spatial constraints bred both environmental conscientiousness and historical aggression.

Knowing the energy rays tracked him like GPS, Guan Yu lingered briefly before strolling out. Passing the security office, he waved at Sakurako and wandered the streets—800.

His dual purposes here: retrieve or destroy the OuYang family’s weapons, and confront “Warrior Ito” to ascertain if others besides him had returned from the Demon Tower.

Meandering through Hujō, he feigned tourist interest while his spiritual sense scanned fifty kilometers. Beyond the suburbs lay low hills masking underground facilities—heavily shielded, likely military.

Finding no other anomalies, Guan Yu relaxed at a teahouse, savoring East Island’s tea ceremony.

At 5:30 PM, an East Island number lit his phone. Smirking at his “modified yet irresistible” looks, he answered to see a stunning figure at the café entrance—Sakurako, now in a sleeveless tee and white shorts, leaning against a convertible.

Her transformation confirmed his suspicion: the tracking rays were surveillance tools.

Legs sculpted by the shorts drew whistles from passing delinquents—shamates with neon hair and studded denim. Their leader, pink-haired, stomped her hood: “Hey police babe! Off-duty? Join our bar crawl!”

Recognizing Watanabe Society gang members, Sakurako ignored them, gaze locked on Guan Yu. As he approached, the shamates intercepted, spitting: “F***ing Chinese pig!”

**Chapter 1711: Death to National Insulters**

Westerners might conflate East Asians, but mutual distinctiveness was obvious to natives. Enraged by Sakurako’s disregard, the gang redirected their vitriol at Guan Yu.

“What’d you say, trash?” Guan Yu retorted in flawless East Island dialect.

Confirmed he was Chinese, they encircled him, blades flashing. Sakurako interposed despite her heels: “Harm foreign tourists, and I arrest you!”

“Chinese pigs restrict us globally!” the leader sneered. “You his whore? Disgrace! Apologize on your knees!”

Blushing furiously, Sakurako argued for Sino-Island cooperation against Western powers. Bystanders jeered, parroting anti-Chinese rhetoric.

Guan Yu squeezed her hand. “Prejudices die hard. These vermin insulted China. They die.”

The gang laughed. “Kill us? Here?”

Masking lethal intent, Guan Yu channeled qi needles into their brains. As the leader lunged, Sakurako disarmed him with a spinning kick—her legs mesmerizing onlookers, some even climaxing publicly.

“Pathetic,” Guan Yu muttered as Sakurako blushed.

The gang leader howled: “Pretty bitch! Should be in adult films serving real men! Traitor!”

Sakurako trembled with rage. “You disgrace our nation! I’ll—”

Guan Yu restrained her. “Don’t bother. They’ll meet accidents soon.”

As they fled, Sakurako noted their Watanabe Society affiliation.

**Chapter 1712: Watanabe Society**

Though Watanabe members often harassed her, they’d never fled from her pistol before. Puzzled, she holstered it as Guan Yu led her away—unaware his qi would soon trigger cerebral hemorrhages in the fleeing trio.
