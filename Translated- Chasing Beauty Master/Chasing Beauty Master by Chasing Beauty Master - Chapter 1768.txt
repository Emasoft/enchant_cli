Wang Jun said, “Guan Yu, I’ve thought of a plan, but it might require you to take a risk.”

“What plan? Tell me. My mind isn’t working well right now,” Guan Yu replied earnestly.

“If you go out alone now, with Xiao Hei (Little Black) here, Chief Miao likely won’t give you trouble. Even if a fight breaks out, escaping alone wouldn’t be an issue for you,” Wang Jun explained. “Once you provoke Lai Lixia and her group into attacking, the rest of us can seize the chance to advance.”

As he spoke, Wang Jun handed Guan Yu a crossbow. Before Guan Yu could move, Siqi interjected urgently, “No! It’s too dangerous! Chief Miao has five demonic practitioners with him—their abilities are unpredictable. Sending Guan Yu alone is reckless. I won’t allow it!”

Siqi naturally refused to let Guan Yu face such peril alone. The enemy’s strength was formidable, and Lai Lixia’s intentions remained unclear. She couldn’t bear the thought of him taking such a risk.

**Chapter 4625: Leaving Without Hesitation**

Wang Jun countered, “If we all go out, Chief Miao will be furious at the sight of so many intruders. This place isn’t welcoming to outsiders. Guan Yu alone is the best choice. With his skills, escaping unharmed won’t be difficult. Why worry?”

Guan Yu agreed. Venturing out now might be the optimal strategy. Relying on Xiao Hei to incite conflict had proven futile.

“Fine. Wait for the right moment,” Guan Yu said, accepting the crossbow. He turned to Siqi. “Protect yourself. Don’t worry—I’ll be safe. The distance is short. Even if I’m in danger, you can intervene in time.”

Seeing his resolve, Siqi swallowed her objections. “I’ll protect myself. You must do the same,” she said firmly.

Guan Yu assessed the situation. Nearby, Xiao Hei chirped, “Big Brother is nice! He gave me sweet cakes! Chief Grandpa, they were so tasty!”

“That ‘Big Brother’ is a ghost. Stay away, or he’ll bring you misfortune,” Chief Miao warned. “If you see him again, keep your distance. Understand?”

Xiao Hei nodded obediently. Her trust in Guan Yu had dwindled—precisely the moment Guan Yu chose to step forward.

Crossbow in hand, Guan Yu strode out confidently. “Chief Miao, teaching children such superstitions is unwise. I’m no ghost—have you ever seen a ghost this handsome?”

He felt no fear. Even if a fight erupted, he could hold his own against Chief Miao’s followers.

“Big Brother! You’re still here! Where’s my sweet cake?” Xiao Hei exclaimed, eyeing him like a treat.

“I couldn’t fetch it with these troublemakers delaying me,” Guan Yu said, gesturing at Lai Lixia’s group. He approached Xiao Hei and bowed politely to Chief Miao. “We meant no intrusion. We seek an item and will leave before nightfall.”

“You think Miao City is yours to enter and exit as you please?” snarled one of Chief Miao’s men. “Absurd!”

Guan Yu smiled wryly. The anger was justified—they were trespassers.

Lai Lixia glared. “Guan Yu! To think you’d collude with these demons—disgraceful for a disciple of a righteous sect!”

“Your hypocrisy amuses me,” Guan Yu retorted, narrowing his eyes. “Weren’t you and that fool Yue Jing inseparable? The ‘Red Lotus Sect’s Two Fools’? Where’s your partner? Reduced to a lone fool now?”

Lai Lixia trembled with rage. “Traitor! We should unite against these demons, yet you slander us! I’ll demand justice from Yunqing Sect!”

“Do as you please. I doubt Yue Jing survived the beasts outside,” Guan Yu sneered.

“Enough!” Chief Miao interrupted coldly. “I spare you today. Leave Miao City—this is your final warning.”

Guan Yu seized the opportunity. “We’ll take our leave. Apologies for the disturbance.” He signaled his group to retreat.

“Chief! Letting intruders go violates our laws!” protested a demonic practitioner.

“Today isn’t for bloodshed. Our duty is to protect Miao City,” Chief Miao declared.

Lai Lixia watched in frustration as Guan Yu’s group departed. *Are they abandoning the Eight-Drum Technique?* she wondered. Her own forces, reduced to a handful, stood no chance against Miao City’s defenders.

Chief Miao had wisely avoided conflict, sensing Guan Yu’s latent power. With Guan Yu’s allies revealed, retreat proved prudent.

**Chapter 4626: Leave It to Us**

As Guan Yu passed Lai Lixia, he smirked. “The Eight-Drum Technique is yours. We lack the courage to storm a city of demons. Try it yourselves—if you dare.”

Lai Lixia noticed Zhenyang Sect members with Guan Yu. Isolated, her hopes dwindled. Yet surrendering the technique was unthinkable—too many Red Lotus disciples had died for it.

Guan Yu’s group pressed onward. “Why is the Red Lotus Sect fixated on Miao City?” Wang Jun asked.

“They likely believe the technique’s hidden there,” Guan Yu replied. “If so, it’s hopeless. Those demons are invincible. Let’s check the mountains—the legends point there.”

Siqi frowned. “If Miao City’s impenetrable, why does Lai Lixia linger?”

“She craves glory,” Guan Yu said. “Securing the technique would elevate her status. Desperation blinds her.”

“Fools,” Wang Jun muttered. “They’d rather die than seek allies.”

Meanwhile, Lai Lixia attempted diplomacy. “Chief Miao, the Eight-Drum Technique holds no value for you. Name your price—the Red Lotus Sect will fulfill it.”

“We want nothing from your sect,” Chief Miao spat. “Leave—now.”

“Surely you have needs! We’ll—”

“Enough!” Chief Miao’s patience snapped. “Your sect is insignificant next to Yunqing Sect or the Demon Soul Sect. Begone!”

Defeated, Lai Lixia retreated. *We’ll return with reinforcements,* she vowed.

**Chapter 4627: Discovering the Target**

Chief Miao dispersed the crowd, his expression grave. “Return home. Stay indoors—no matter what occurs.”

Xiao Hei tugged his sleeve. “Grandpa Chief, I’m hungry. Make me food?”

“Go to your grandmother, child. I have matters to attend.”

Alone, Chief Miao sighed deeply and walked into the shadows.

Guan Yu’s group soared over hills via flight techniques. Time was scarce—dusk approached.

Ahead bloomed a mountain awash with flowers—peach-like trees bursting with color, their fragrance intoxicating.

“How beautiful!” Siqi marveled.

“Beware,” Guan Yu warned. “Such beauty often masks danger.”

Three flower-clad peaks loomed. The choice was clear yet perilous.
