“What just happened to you?” Zhou Xiaoyou asked Guan Yu, clearly puzzled by his earlier distraction.

“Nothing. I just feel like something interesting might happen here,” Guan Yu replied with a grin.

Beside them, Leopard listened intently. Hearing Guan Yu’s words, he immediately sensed that trouble was brewing, his face lighting up with excitement.

Truthfully, Leopard had always been combative—a trait evident since his first encounter with Guan Yu. Had it not been for his thirst for battle, Guan Yu might never have gained such a loyal subordinate.

Suddenly, those eyes flashed again. Guan Yu felt their gaze distinctly.

He steadied his mind, probing the source of the piercing stare. At first, it seemed to come from all directions.

Finally, he pinpointed its origin: northeast. Opening his eyes, he saw exactly what he expected—a pair of unsettling eyes gleaming in the shadows.

Leopard followed Guan Yu’s gaze and spotted them too. The eyes were unnerving, the sort that would terrify the timid or reduce a child to tears.

The owner of those eyes, realizing both Guan Yu and Leopard had noticed him, broke his stare and vanished. Though his motives remained unclear, one thing was certain: those eyes held no goodwill, only provocation.

Guan Yu dismissed the encounter. If a fight arose, the man would reappear. For now, there was no need to dwell on it.

During lunch break, Guan Yu, Zhou Xiaoyou, and Leopard were summoned to the school board office by Daoist Wild Crane. The trio exchanged puzzled glances—being called in at such an hour was unusual unless urgent matters loomed.

They knocked, and Daoist Wild Crane beckoned them inside.

The moment they entered, the air froze.

A domineering aura pressed down on them. Though Guan Yu himself radiated arrogance, this presence felt wilder, more chaotic—yet undeniably formidable.

Unfazed, Guan Yu retaliated with his own aura. The two forces clashed silently before dissolving into equilibrium.

When Guan Yu locked eyes with the stranger across the room, a smirk tugged his lips. *Friend or foe?* he wondered, eager to learn the answer.

Neither spoke, awaiting Daoist Wild Crane’s introduction.

Wan Qingyang burst through the door, exclaiming, “Ah! I meant to escort you, but I got sidetracked by a bathroom break. You’re already here!”

An imaginary flock of crows seemed to caw overhead at the awkward timing.

Dressed in a sleek black suit that screamed success, Wan Qingyang’s dignified appearance clashed comically with his haphazard entrance.

Guan Yu couldn’t help but snort with laughter.

“What’s wrong? Is something off?” Wan Qingyang fumbled with his tie, flustered by the reaction.

“Nothing,” Guan Yu chuckled, though the stranger continued staring him down, unblinking.

As the tension lingered, Daoist Wild Crane remained silent, in no rush to explain.

The two men’s gazes remained locked—a silent contest only they understood. Onlookers watched in confusion but held their tongues.

**Chapter 1122: Friend or Foe**

After a prolonged standoff, Guan Yu extended his hand. “Guan Yu.”

The stranger gripped it firmly. “Liao Yuntian.”

Daoist Wild Crane clapped approvingly at the handshake. Both men turned to him for answers.

“I imagine you’re both curious why I arranged this meeting,” the Daoist began. “Yuntian already knows his purpose here. As for you, Guan Yu—let me explain. During your class, Yuntian observed you. His strength is considerable, and we intend for him to be your training rival. Disciples of the Proud Heaven Sect are no ordinary cultivators. He’s here to hone your skills.”

*So that’s it,* Guan Yu mused, studying the battle-hardened glint in Liao Yuntian’s eyes.

“In summary,” Daoist Wild Crane concluded, “you are both rivals and allies. Understood?”

“Understood,” Guan Yu replied, though Liao Yuntian’s piercing stare suggested only rivalry. Not that Guan Yu minded—a worthy opponent would make cultivation far more engaging.

“Why not spar here?” Wan Qingyang suggested, noting their eager expressions.

Daoist Wild Crane raised a hand. “My office may lack priceless artifacts, but I’d prefer it intact.” His demeanor remained unflappably calm.

“Let’s compete to retrieve that.” Liao Yuntian pointed to a pen holder on the desk.

Guan Yu nodded. Since reaching the Spiritual Silence Stage, his confidence had soared. Though he once viewed the Heartbeat Stage as formidable, he now understood the long road ahead in his cultivation journey.

“I’ll referee!” Wan Qingyang declared enthusiastically.

Daoist Wild Crane observed quietly. As Proud Heaven Sect’s star disciple, Liao Yuntian’s prowess was unquestionable. This match promised insight into both men’s growth.

“Begin!” Wan Qingyang waved his hand. Both figures vanished.

Moments later, Liao Yuntian reappeared, pen holder in hand. Guan Yu materialized seconds later, clutching a single pen from the container.

Though bested, Guan Yu’s ability to snatch the pen undetected earned a raised eyebrow from Liao Yuntian. The victory was clear, but the margin narrower than expected.

Guan Yu studied his rival, sensing an indescribable aura about him—mysterious yet compelling. Liao Yuntian returned the appraisal, his earlier hostility tempered with newfound curiosity.

“Guan Yu, are you alright?” Zhou Xiaoyou asked, concerned by his prolonged silence.

“Just thinking,” he reassured her before planting a quick kiss on her lips.

Leopard turned away, flushing crimson—a hardened warrior unaccustomed to public affection. Guan Yu roared with laughter at his comrade’s embarrassment.

**Chapter 1123: The Trial**

Daily sparring with Yuntian accelerated Guan Yu’s progress. The older cultivator proved both a worthy rival and inadvertent mentor. They often meditated on the school’s back mountain, with Yuntian administering monthly trials. Only upon passing these could Guan Yu attempt advancing to the Golden Core Stage.

Having narrowly lost their previous two matches, Guan Yu arrived at the moonlit mountain on the 15th, determined to at least draw this round.

Yuntian and Daoist Wild Crane waited. “Apologies for being late,” Guan Yu said, scratching his head.

The Daoist waved dismissively. “School life brings delays. Begin when ready.”

Wan Qingyang interjected excitedly: “Today’s trial—race to the teaching building! First arrival wins!”

Daoist Wild Crane nodded. The route spanned two peaks, with Earth Shrinking Techniques disabled in this mystically warded area. “Certain spots permit the technique, but finding them is like seeking needles in haystacks. Best proceed conventionally.”

Before “begin” fully left Wan Qingyang’s lips, Yuntian vanished. Guan Yu gave chase, soon discovering the trial’s true difficulty—dense, pathless woods where even flight proved impossible.

Disoriented beneath a disorienting moon, Guan Yu stumbled until a slender figure caught his eye—a female student skittering unnaturally across the ground. She vanished each time he tried focusing, leading him in circles until he abruptly emerged at the forest’s edge.

Ahead on the road, Yuntian maintained a taunting lead. Guan Yu sprinted, his enhanced physique handling the hills effortlessly—until realizing the distance never changed.

A passing car’s distortion through an invisible barrier revealed the trick: illusions. As Guan Yu processed this, the red-eyed apparition reappeared, lunging before dissolving into thin air. A crash in the woods signaled her departure, leaving Guan Yu free to resume the race—now aware of the mystical traps complicating their contest.
