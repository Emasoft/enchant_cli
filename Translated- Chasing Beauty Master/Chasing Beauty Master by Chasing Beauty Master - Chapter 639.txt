“How are you going to leave? If my mother doesn't see you tomorrow morning, she’ll tear me apart!” Sun Xiaoya rolled her eyes and grumbled.

Guan Yu glanced helplessly at the bedroom window. Though it was the fifth floor, the height posed no issue—he could leave in seconds without even opening the window, simply teleporting away.

But he couldn’t reveal his mystical abilities in front of Sun Xiaoya, an ordinary person. Doing so would terrify her beyond measure.

“Forget it, Teacher Sun. You should sleep. I’ll… just sit here all night,” Guan Yu muttered, lowering his head. Yet as he did, his gaze inadvertently drifted to the neckline of her nightgown.

*Ah, improper sight!* He guiltily averted his eyes. It hadn’t been intentional—just a fleeting glance.

Sun Xiaoya, however, noticed his hurried evasion. To her, his flustered reaction betrayed guilt.

*He’s just a child, my student. It’s fine… Teenagers are naturally curious about the opposite sex!* She reassured herself, though her racing heartbeat betrayed her composure.

“You have class tomorrow! Staying up all night isn’t an option. Ugh, I shouldn’t have asked you over! Fine—we’ll share the bed!” Resigned, she kicked off her slippers and sat cross-legged on the mattress.

“What are you staring at? Get up here—I’m turning off the light!” she said with forced calm.

“R-really? We’re sleeping together?” Guan Yu hesitated.

“Enough questions! Are you coming or not?” Her patience frayed, she glared at him.

*Hah! I’m trying to protect your reputation as a respectable woman, and you’re the one acting ungrateful!*

*Screw it. I’ve weathered worse storms—what’s sharing a bed?* Annoyed, Guan Yu strode to the other side and flopped onto the mattress.

“Hey, move over! Don’t crowd me—stay on your pillow!” Despite her bossy tone, Sun Xiaoya tensed as he settled in.

“Tired. Let’s sleep,” Guan Yu mumbled, rolling over and pulling her into his arms. With a flick of his finger, the bedroom light snuffed out.

Sun Xiaoya froze, rigid as stone in his embrace.

“Sleep. What’s there to overthink?” he whispered by her ear.

“N-nothing. Goodnight.” Her voice trembled faintly.

Nestled against him, Sun Xiaoya found an unexpected sense of safety. Her chaotic thoughts gradually blurred, and she drifted into deep slumber.

Listening to her steady breaths, Guan Yu smirked bitterly. After returning to the city, he’d ended up sharing a bed not with Du Xiaojuan, Feng Xin, or Liu Shilei—women he knew well—but with a teacher he’d met two days prior.

In truth, he hadn’t slept in over a decade. Years of battling in illusory realms had left him feeling reborn upon awakening.

At his cultivation level, sleep and food were unnecessary. Yet cradling her delicate form, lulled by her faint floral scent, his eyelids grew heavy. For the first time in years, he sank into profound rest.

The next morning, the alarm jolted them awake.

Sun Xiaoya stiffened, horrified to find her leg draped over Guan Yu’s waist and her arms locked around his neck.

*I usually hug my blanket while sleeping… But last night, he replaced it!* Heat flooded her cheeks.

“Ahem.” Guan Yu glanced at their entangled bodies and chuckled awkwardly. “Time to get up, Teacher Sun.”

“Oh!” She scrambled back like a startled rabbit, leaping off the bed.

“I’ll wash up first!” She bolted from the room.

Rubbing his temples, Guan Yu marveled. He hadn’t needed sleep, yet he’d dozed off holding her—and awakened refreshed.

Sun Xiaoya’s sharp cry interrupted his musing: “Get out! I need to change!”

“Child, why fuss? Changing in front of your husband’s normal!” The elderly woman—suddenly at the doorway—scolded.

“I’ll go wash!” Guan Yu fled. *Good grief—if I were an ordinary man, this mother-in-law would be too much!*

**Chapter 1624: The Little Brat**

“Mom, we’re leaving…”

In Sun Xiaoya’s Beetle, Guan Yu sighed. The old woman’s endless parting advice rivaled a doting birth mother’s.

“About last night… keep it secret,” Sun Xiaoya said, cheeks pink as she drove.

“Of course.” He paused. “Has your mother… seen a doctor?”

“Yes. They said it’s a type of dementia—untreatable. Just keep her happy.” Her voice faltered.

“Hmm.” Guan Yu narrowed his eyes. He knew of Alzheimer’s—with his current power, he might attempt a cure.

But failure could worsen her condition. *If she starts calling me “son-in-law” or imagines grandchildren…* He shuddered.

As they arrived at school, students noticed Guan Yu exiting the teacher’s car. Sun Xiaoya, though new, drew attention for her beauty.

“Teacher Sun… should I come tonight?” Guan Yu lingered.

She flushed, recalling their morning embrace. *He’s my student—this isn’t proper. But Gao Jun might target him…*

“Come with me after school.” The excuse soothed her conscience.

Nodding, Guan Yu didn’t mind. The唠叨 mother was a small price for peace.

“You see? The new guy rode in with Teacher Sun!” A fat student bellowed upon entering Class 6.

“Pathetic. Brother Jun didn’t even bother ambushing him,” Yang Lin sneered, heading to Class 5. *Time to deploy the tofu pudding prank.*

“Teacher Sun’s too kind. Otherwise, he’d be bleeding by now.”

“This’ll just piss off Gao Jun more.”

As Yang Lin left, classmates buzzed. Xu Ying frowned at her desk, gazing outside.

When Guan Yu entered, silence fell. Scornful and wary eyes tracked him.

A boy nearby warned, “Dude, you’re bold riding with the teacher. But watch out—this’ll provoke Wang Jun.”

Guan Yu shrugged. *They think I’m hiding? Please—she invited me.*

“Thanks for the heads-up.” He nodded. Kindness deserved kindness.

Xu Ying hissed, “Skip class a few days. Let this blow over.”

“Worried about me?” He grinned. Beneath her icy demeanor, she had a heart.

“Newbie! You dare talk to my woman?!” Wang Jun kicked open the door, flanked by Yang Lin and lackeys.

“Who’s your woman? Shut your mouth!” Xu Ying slammed a book, furious.

Wang Jun glowered. *Twice she’s humiliated me for this punk.*

Yang Lin approached, hiding a yellow-stained bag. “Told you not to mess with Brother Jun!”

Guan Yu sensed mischief. They weren’t here for a fair fight.

Yang Lin hurled the bag—filled with urine—but Guan Yu’s hands blurred. With a qi-inflected palm, he contained the liquid, twisted Yang Lin’s arm, and flung the bag back.

The classroom erupted in laughter as Yang Lin dripped foulness.

“Bastard!” Roaring, Yang Lin swung a chair at Guan Yu’s head.

Guan Yu leaned back, kicked Yang Lin’s chest, and sent him crashing into Wang Jun’s gang.

“Get off me!” Wang Jun shoved Yang Lin aside, revolted by the urine on his hands.

The bell saved face. “You think you’re tough? This isn’t over!” Wang Jun fled, lackeys trailing.

“New material, please. ‘Wait and see’ is so last season,” Guan Yu muttered, opening his textbook.

The entering teacher wrinkled his nose at Yang Lin. “Clean yourself up—get out!”

**Chapter 1625: Deterrence**

Yang Lin clutched his chest, blood-tinted shock in his eyes. His pride—and ribs—were shattered.

Wang Jun seethed. *Even I couldn’t dodge that kick.* His thugs clamored for revenge, but the bell had spared them humiliation.

“Think you’re hot stuff ’cause you know kung fu? You’re dead!” Wang Jun’s retreating threat echoed.

Guan Yu snorted. “Waiting for your sister, maybe?”

The teacher ignored Yang Lin’s injuries, disdain clear. “Class begins!”
