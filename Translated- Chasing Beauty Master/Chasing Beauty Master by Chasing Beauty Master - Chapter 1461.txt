When she saw Guan Yu’s current state, an inexplicable pang of heartache struck her. Guan Yu sighed deeply, slowly opening his eyes. “I’m fine. Everything’s alright. Hmm? What’s wrong with you? Why are you crying?”

Wang Xiaorong sniffled, stepping forward with a mix of tears and reproach. “It’s because I was worried about you! Look at yourself—drenched in sweat. I had no idea what was happening. Of course I was scared!”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “Really, I’m okay. Don’t fret. Look how worked up you’ve gotten. Stop crying now, be good.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded obediently. “Seeing you like this… I didn’t know what to do. If you hadn’t woken up soon, I would’ve gone to fetch help.”

“No need to worry. See? I’m perfectly fine now.”

“Yes… I overreacted.” Wang Xiaorong managed a small smile. Guan Yu’s safety was her foremost concern. “By the way, how did your discussion with the artifact spirit go? Did it absorb the Eight-Drum Technique?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Still no success. The Eight-Drum Technique is tenacious and willful. Though the artifact spirit can extract it, the energy resists—it insists on battling the seal in my mind before relenting.”

“The artifact spirit was extremely cautious earlier, but the Eight-Drum Technique grew volatile, likely due to years of confinement. It becomes agitated in such situations, refusing to leave my body. The artifact spirit dared not act forcefully, fearing harm to me, so we had to pause.”

“No progress? What now?” Wang Xiaorong fretted.

“I’m unsure for now. We must proceed gradually. Perhaps the artifact spirit will succeed next time. This can’t be rushed,” Guan Yu explained.

Knowing Guan Yu wished to avoid the Demon Lord’s involvement, Wang Xiaorong refrained from mentioning it to prevent discord. Relieved he was unharmed, she said, “Guan Yu, I’ll have hot water brought for you. Clean up properly—you’re soaked through.”

Only then did Guan Yu notice his drenched clothes. “How did this happen? Did it rain?”

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “No rain! Even if there were, this room doesn’t leak. You’ve been sweating profusely.”

“Ah, I see.” Realization dawned—the artifact spirit’s frigid energy had seeped directly into his body, chilling him to the core. Cold sweats were inevitable.

The following day, Guan Yu remained secluded, studying how to extract the Eight-Drum Technique.

Elsewhere, the Demon Lord sat in his meditation chamber, addressing Wang Xiaorong and the Left Envoy below. “Rong’er, how has Guan Yu been faring? Isn’t it time he departed?”

Wang Xiaorong stiffened. What did her father mean? He’d insisted on bringing Guan Yu to the Demon Soul Sect, yet now sought to expel him after mere days?

“Father, Guan Yu has been well. His only concern is Xiao Zhi’s safety—the friend imprisoned in Cloud Azure Sect.”

“If he cares, let him rescue the boy! What use are empty words while he idles here? Tell him this isn’t an inn. He should leave soon.” The dismissal grew unmistakable.

Wang Xiaorong protested, “Father! I want him to stay longer! Moreover, returning to Cloud Azure Sect now would endanger him!”

“Danger or not, that’s irrelevant. The entire Jianghu hunts him—only our sect offers refuge. If he doesn’t emerge soon, Cloud Azure will issue a kill-on-sight order.”

The Demon Lord’s intent was clear: Guan Yu wasn’t sect kin, thus undeserving of protection. Forcing him out would corner him—return to Cloud Azure meant death; survival required joining the Demon Soul Sect. This leverage would compel submission.

Wang Xiaorong stamped her foot. “Father! Guan Yu is extraordinary! Even if he stayed forever, you mustn’t drive him away!”

“You…” The Demon Lord sighed. “Rong’er, what sorcery does this boy wield? He’s trapped between choices—return to Cloud Azure or join us. Once he pledges allegiance, I won’t interfere. Otherwise, he leaves tomorrow.”

“Father, why must you be so heartless?”

The Left Envoy interjected, “Young Mistress, the Demon Lord acts for your sake. Prolonged stay here brands Guan Yu a traitor in Cloud Azure’s eyes. Better he chooses now—return to die, or join us. As our member, you could be together eternally.”

Though the logic resonated, Wang Xiaorong resisted coercing Guan Yu. Yet the prospect of his allegiance tempted her into conflicted silence.

“But if he chooses Cloud Azure…” she worried.

“Then his heart belongs not to you, but them. You’d need not mourn such a man,” the Left Envoy stated.

“Enough.” The Demon Lord waved dismissively. “Left Envoy, what news from Cloud Azure?”

“Xiao Zhi was poisoned with Blood Toxin by Yanzhao and confined to Bamboo Peak. Patriarch Xuanming nearly executed him, but relented after Elder Lu’s pleas. However, Cloud Azure now conducts strict disciple inspections—likely hunting spies.”

The Demon Lord nodded. “Foolish—every peak’s elder knows their disciples. This pretext hides deeper motives.”

“Our informants may be at risk, particularly those blood-poisoned.”

“Minor losses. We’ll replace them. Xuanming can’t waste eternity on inspections.”

Wang Xiaorong frowned. “Won’t Yanzhao be exposed?”

“As Xuanming’s chief disciple, his status may shield him. Speculation aside, we’ll see.”

Later, Wang Xiaorong visited Guan Yu, finding him preparing an enormous wooden tub. “What’s this for?”

Guan Yu grinned. “I discovered water immersion might calm the Eight-Drum energy—expanded pores and quicker bloodflow could help. I’ll try again submerged. Guard the door?”

After arranging hot water, Wang Xiaorong added, “I hope this works. Oh—Xiao Zhi’s safe for now, thanks to Elder Lu’s intervention. Cloud Azure searches for you intensely.”

“Xiao Zhi’s safety suffices. My priority is succeeding here.” Guan Yu’s success meant freedom to return openly to Cloud Azure—delays only worsened his plight.

Wang Xiaorong silently prayed for his triumph, dreading her father’s ultimatum. The Demon Lord now seemed willing to abandon interest in the Eight-Drum Technique just to expel Guan Yu.

At Cloud Azure Sect, Elder Lu sought to visit Xiao Zhi despite restrictions. Bringing roasted chicken, spiced pork, and wine to Bamboo Peak’s Elder Mu, he appealed: “Brother Mu, after centuries together, are we not closer than kin?”

Elder Mu saw through the gesture. “You wish to see Xiao Zhi? Even these delicacies won’t sway me—Patriarch’s orders forbid it.”

“Our bond needs no bribery,” Elder Lu deflected. “I merely seek information about their mountain mission.”

Cornered, Elder Mu proposed consulting Xuanming—a stalling tactic. Infuriated, Elder Lu pretended to leave, snatching back the wine. “Better feed this to pigs than waste it here!”

“You—!” Elder Mu sputtered, insulted yet helpless as the petty retaliation unfolded.
