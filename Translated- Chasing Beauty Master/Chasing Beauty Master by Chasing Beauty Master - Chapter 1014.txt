“Before today, I truly underestimated Guan Yu on the second floor. However, now is when Guan Yu's forces are at their weakest, with only a handful of people around him. If we don't seize him and obtain the treasure map today, we'll likely never get another chance. Moreover, after today, your Feng Family should brace for Guan Yu's merciless retaliation.”

Young Master Feng immediately made a bitter face upon hearing this. “Bill Lin, how could you set me up like this? Guan Yu's capabilities are unfathomable. Even after knowing him this long, I still can't grasp the full extent of his powers. He once slipped into my sister's chambers unnoticed—today it could be my room. I might die without knowing how! You must help me!”

Terrified, Young Master Feng knew Bill Lin was his only lifeline. Without Bill’s aid, he believed Guan Yu could effortlessly end him.

Bill Lin shot him a disdainful look, amused by his fear. “Begging me now is useless. The situation has escalated. Our only path is to storm in and kill Guan Yu to eliminate this threat permanently. There’s no alternative.”

Young Master Feng agreed. Only Guan Yu’s death today could ensure peaceful nights ahead. He’d endured nights too terrified to close his eyes or return home—all due to Guan Yu’s torment. With Bill Lin beside him now, his courage surged. “Very well. I’ll follow your lead completely today. Kill Guan Yu, and henceforth you may choose any beauty first—I’ll harbor no resentment.”

Bill Lin privately wavered. He’d assumed Guan Yu’s weakened state at the temple presented the perfect opportunity. Yet despite mobilizing substantial forces during Guan Yu’s vulnerable moment, their efforts proved futile—an outcome that frustrated him deeply.

After extensive intelligence-gathering and acting on classified information about Guan Yu’s whereabouts, this strike should have succeeded. Yet even with overwhelming numbers, they’d made no progress. Young Master Feng observed Bill Lin, who’d never suffered Guan Yu’s wrath firsthand. But Feng had—he’d drained the Feng Corporation’s funds hiring a supreme assassin, only for Guan Yu to slaughter the elite killer. That humiliation haunted him, leaving Guan Yu’s very name a trigger for dread.

Though Young Master Feng had recently regained some composure, Bill Lin’s renewed obsession with Guan Yu reignited his fears. Yet with the mighty Bill Clan’s backing, he’d hoped for immunity. Now, Bill Lin’s attempt to shift responsibility onto him felt like betrayal.

At this moment, Young Master Feng desperately hoped Bill Lin would succeed today—or insomnia would plague him again tonight.

Bill Lin approached Hada, finding him tending to Hasan’s injuries. Sighing, he marveled at Guan Yu’s prowess. Hada, nearing First-Class Honor cultivation, was a formidable expert anywhere. Yet even he had been bested—explaining Young Master Feng’s terror at Guan Yu’s mention.

“Hada,” Bill Lin inquired, “when you were inside, did you see how many bricks they have left?”

Finishing his healing efforts, Hada exhaled and opened his eyes. “A small pile remains. There’s a chubby fellow inside collecting scattered bricks for reuse.”

“What’s Guan Yu’s cultivation level? You were surrounded earlier—in a one-on-one fight, could you defeat him?” Bill Lin pressed, needing to gauge whether to abort the mission.

Hada pondered. “Though I didn’t see Guan Yu act personally, I’m certain it was him directing others. My apologies, Young Master—I cannot assess his strength.”

“What?!” Bill Lin stared in shock. “You mean Guan Yu didn’t lift a finger while his underlings crippled three of you?!”

Hada nodded grimly. “Correct. Guan Yu merely issued commands while a monk and young girl fought us.”

Bill Lin grimaced. “If the compound holds so many experts, continuing this assault is pointless. No number of men could overwhelm them.”

Young Master Feng rushed over excitedly. “Bill Lin! My guards will scale the walls again. Those inside must be exhausted—perhaps we’ll breach the gates this time!”

Bill Lin shook his head. “Feng, you’ve interacted with Guan Yu extensively. How would you rate his personal power?”

“Why ask?” Feng frowned. “Remember when I spent 200 million hiring an international First-Class Honor assassin? Guan Yu killed him—it made the news! What does that tell you?”

Bill Lin chuckled darkly. “We’re eggs dashing against stone. Today’s endeavor is futile. Capturing Guan Yu is impossible.”

Chapter 2593: The Turn

“What?!” Young Master Feng gaped. “Why abandon now? Your forces haven’t even been deployed! If you don’t help me eliminate Guan Yu today, how will I survive his vengeance?!”

Bill Lin gestured at Hada’s injuries. “They were defeated without Guan Yu lifting a hand. Should we send more lambs to slaughter?”

“Impossible! How could he have so many experts?!” Feng exclaimed, realizing Guan Yu’s retainers alone had overwhelmed Hada. Had Guan Yu intervened, escape would’ve been impossible.

“The compound has few occupants—they can’t all be masters!” Feng protested.

Bill Lin regarded him like a fool. “Hada himself admitted this. Do these injuries look feigned?”

Hada sighed under Feng’s questioning stare. “The girl was formidable—she easily subdued Hasan. The four monks coordinated flawlessly. Three overwhelmed me through teamwork.”

Young Master Feng’s heart chilled. “Thank heaven the gates held! Had they fallen, Guan Yu would’ve slaughtered us all. These useless guards couldn’t touch him!”

“What was Guan Yu doing during the fight?”

“Observing and directing,” Hada said. “The masked girl handled us effortlessly.”

Despair gripped Feng. Having thoroughly provoked Guan Yu today yet failed, retribution was inevitable. “Bill Lin, you’ve doomed me! Solve this today or I’m dead!”

Bill Lin scoffed. “Guan Yu’s no demon. I’ve fortified your estate into an iron fortress. Even tanks would struggle to breach it. Stay calm.”

Unconvinced, Feng pressed, “We’re already committed—order your men to charge when my guards open the gates!”

“This is idiocy!” Bill Lin snapped. “Their experts could decimate triple our numbers. These mercenaries aren’t expendable!”

Trapped between进退两难, Feng realized home wasn’t safe either. “We’re already battered—one more strike might work!”

“Then waste your men’s lives,” Bill Lin dismissed. “Mine stay put.”

As Feng stormed off to mobilize guards, his security captain cautioned, “Young Master, repeating this tactic is futile. The men dread the brick barrage.”

Feng exploded. “I feed you parasites for nothing?! Scared of a few bricks? They won’t kill you—stop whining!”

Though terrified, the guards muttered rebelliously. “Why doesn’t he climb the wall himself if it’s so easy?” one whispered before being hushed.

Chapter 2594: Brainless Schemes

Recognizing the stalemate, the captain proposed, “Young Master, let’s blockade the mountain’s sole path. Send bulldozers to demolish the walls—then swarm in.”

Feng brightened but hesitated at the two-hour delay. Consulting Bill Lin, he received instant rejection. “I blocked our retreat to prevent Guan Yu’s reinforcements. Your plan’s too late.”

“You fool!” Feng roared. “You trapped us here?!”

“Silence!” Bill Lin retorted. “Should Guan Yu’s allies arrive, we’d be annihilated! Your hindsight is worthless now!”

As Feng mentally cursed Bill Lin’s lineage, panic set in. “What if Guan Yu’s reinforcements come? We’re sitting ducks!”

Bill Lin shrugged. “I didn’t anticipate his retinue’s strength. Now we strategize escape.”

“Brainless imbecile!” Feng shouted. “You knew Guan Yu’s power! This is your disaster!”

Unfazed, Bill Lin sneered, “Guan Yu wouldn’t dare harm me—but you? Remember Rian Qiang’s fate. Best pray we escape intact.”

The exchange crystallized Feng’s nightmare—a life as Guan Yu’s mind-broken puppet, or worse.
