“Young Master, judging by your attire, you must be from a prominent family. It’s merely a pot of wine and a few dishes—why be so stingy?” Cuihua smiled. “Servants! Bring the Young Master our finest decade-aged vintage and several signature dishes.”

“At once!” a voice answered promptly from beyond the door.

Cuihua knew this man was the Left Envoy of the Mohist Sect, whose cultivation was no trivial matter. Today, only two options remained: either subdue him without letting him escape, or prevent him from discovering this was a lair of the Demon Cavern. Otherwise, none of them could continue living here.

The Left Envoy beside the Demon Lord was not only powerful but shrewd. Ordinary deceptions wouldn’t work on him. Poisoning the food or wine—an idea Cuihua immediately dismissed—would only expose their scheme rather than fool him.

The Left Envoy chuckled, “Little beauty, since the wine and dishes haven’t arrived, why not play me a tune?”

“Of course. What melody would the Young Master like to hear?” Cuihua replied, her smile unwavering.

“Play your most skilled piece. I’m well-versed in music—you can’t fool me. Let’s test your skill,” he said with a grin.

**Chapter 3495: Investigation Results (Part 1)**

Beside the window, a curtain partitioned a corner of the room. Behind it lay an array of instruments. Cuihua walked over, seated herself beside the guzheng, and began plucking its strings.

After only a few notes, the Left Envoy waved his hand impatiently. “Stop! Are you mocking me? As cultivators, shouldn’t you channel spiritual energy into your music? Infusing energy into the instrument enhances its effect—surely you know this?”

Cuihua’s expression shifted. He had already discerned they were cultivators. This was dire—his visit was clearly an intentional probe.

Yet she couldn’t afford hostility yet. Forcing a smile, she said, “The Young Master speaks wisely, but I’ve never attempted such techniques. Since you’re an esteemed cultivator, might you instruct me? I’d be eternally grateful.”

The Left Envoy rose with a laugh and approached. “Very well. I’ll teach you how to weave spiritual energy into music—free of charge. Pay close attention.”

Cuihua feigned concern. “If your guidance proves excellent, I’ll... properly thank you.”

He bent behind her, clasping her small hands to demonstrate on the guzheng. As they played, his spiritual energy subtly clashed against hers through their touch.

Cuihua offered no resistance. Her priority was placating him until his departure. They bore no deep enmity—surely he wouldn’t harm her needlessly. The critical task was hiding this Demon Cavern outpost.

The Left Envoy guided her through a Warring States-era battle anthem—a rousing melody familiar to Cuihua, meant to stir warriors’ fervor. As he played, an ancient bronze bracelet adorned his right wrist, etched with cryptic runes. Its mystical aura glowed faintly when channeling energy into the guzheng.

The tempo accelerated, notes climbing higher. Cuihua sensed his mastery—such rapid melodies demanded exceptional dexterity. Yet he appeared effortless, eyes closed, hands dancing across strings while infusing spiritual energy. The vibrant music echoed through the entire Hall of Echoes.

“I’ve a question requiring complete honesty,” he said as the final high note faded, still gripping her hands. Cuihua detected tension lingering from his performance.

“Ask anything. I’ll withhold nothing,” she whispered.

“Excellent. I appreciate obedient girls.” He stood, adjusting his bracelet. “Being new here, I’m curious—why do mere entertainment-house technicians possess spiritual energy? You’re cultivators.”

“Is it strange to be cultivators?” Cuihua replied unabashed. “Many sisters here aren’t ordinary. Didn’t you know?”

Staring into her eyes, he probed for tells of anxiety. His suspicions about this being a Demon Cavern hideout intensified.

“A commonplace tavern staffed entirely by cultivators—normal?” He smiled thinly. “Our sect once allied with the Demon Cavern—an all-female cultivator group. They vanished years ago. I suspect you’re connected.”

Cuihua rose calmly, feigning surprise. “An all-woman organization? How novel! Our proprietress recruits technicians from afar—perhaps some belong to your mentioned group.”

“But why exclusively cultivators?” he pressed.

She poured him wine. “Simple. Our madam taught us self-defense. In our trade... unruly patrons necessitate protective skills.”

“Impressive. I’d like to meet this madam.” His smile sharpened—he increasingly suspected her of being one of the Demon King Sisters.

“She’s most hospitable! Just last night, she played cards with guests till dawn. Likely still resting.” Cuihua fabricated carefully, “If you wish to meet her, perhaps another visit? I’ll arrange introductions.”

Draining his cup, he sneered, “Clever tongue. Answer this—is your madam a pair of sisters?”

**Chapter 3496: Investigation Results (Part 2)**

The Left Envoy felt certain the proprietress was the Demon King Sisters. Perhaps this girl genuinely didn’t know she’d joined a Demon Cavern cell—the sisters might conceal their identity even from new disciples.

“We only have one madam. A sister-pair? You must be mistaken!” Cuihua beamed, masking inner turmoil. Every technician here knew their allegiance upon learning the sisters’ cultivation arts.

“Merely asking,” he probed. “But meeting her could confirm things.”

Years prior, the Demon Cavern maintained ties with the Mohist Sect. Xiliu and the Left Envoy had been friendly, until the cavern sect went underground to escape Mohist control.

Cornered, Cuihua devised a gambit. “Seeing the madam isn’t impossible. Dine first—I’ll check if she’s awake.”

“Splendid. My thanks.” As she exited, he added mock-courteously, “Don’t tarry.”

Rushing to Xiliu’s third-floor chamber, Cuihua urged, “Sister Liu! His suspicions deepen. He demands to meet you. Perhaps send a decoy?”

Xiliu shook her head. “The Left Envoy—second only to the Demon Lord—can’t be fooled by substitutes. Our cover’s blown.”

Resigned, she continued, “They’ve found us sooner than expected. We must face this.”

Cuihua whispered, “Could Guan Yu or Wang Xiaorong have betrayed us?”

“Unlikely.” Xiliu trusted Guan Yu’s honor and Wang Xiaorong’s loyalty. “If they’d informed, he wouldn’t probe so cautiously.”

“Shall I claim you’re still asleep? Send him away?”

“No escape now.” Xiliu steadied herself. “I’ll meet him. At least spare the Hall of Echoes.”

Cuihua pleaded, “But if he confirms our identities—”

“Our efforts here are forfeit regardless.” Xiliu sighed. “We proceed step by step.”

Meanwhile, the Left Envoy ignored the lavish spread, positioned by the door to observe the staircase. A familiar figure ascended—confirmed when technicians bowed respectfully.

“How ironic,” he murmured. “We searched everywhere, yet you hid a Mohist stronghold’s shadow. The perilous place becomes the safest.”

Qujiang City lay merely a day’s ride from the Mohist Sect. As Xiliu deliberated in her chamber, the door opened to reveal Xitaohua.

“Sister! You’re back early?” Xiliu exclaimed.

Noticing the tension, Xitaohua asked, “What troubles you?”

“The Left Envoy is here.”

Xitaohua paled. “Our year’s work... abandoned so soon?”

Both knew the implications—the Demon Lord would demand their sect’s submission or destruction.

Cuihua interjected, “He appeared unexpectedly. Sister Liu believes concealment is impossible.”

“The Left Envoy’s cunning is legendary,” Xitaohua agreed. “A former imperial detective, unmatched in deduction. No lies withstand his scrutiny.”

**Chapter 3497: A Reason**

The Left Envoy hadn’t always been demonic. A century prior, he’d been the capital’s chief guard—a position earned through merit, not connections. His crime-solving prowess rivaled legendary magistrates.

Starting as a lowly sentry, he aided citizens with petty thefts and missing livestock. Promoted for his deductive brilliance, he cracked every major case—until factional strife led to an aristocrat’s assassination by demonic cultivators.

Tracking the killers, he confronted martial artists beyond his mortal skills. His entire squad fell before a blade meant for his throat—until the Demon Lord intervened, saving him with mesmerizing arts.

Recognizing his latent talent, the Demon Lord took him as a disciple. The former detective abandoned his post, seduced by cultivation’s power—a choice sealing his transformation into the Mohist Sect’s formidable Left Envoy.
