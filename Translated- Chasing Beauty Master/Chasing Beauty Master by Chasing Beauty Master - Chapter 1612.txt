Chapter 4187: Going Out to Play

Zou Wuhui finally understood. No wonder so many people had gathered—none of them actually wanted to accept the mission. They simply wanted to spar with her.

Everyone just wanted to exchange a few moves for fun, perhaps having no real interest in the task itself. This was indeed their true intention.

All these people here were idle souls, bored out of their minds from daily cultivation. Such an amusing event provided the perfect opportunity to stretch their limbs.

Moreover, someone had set a precedent by defeating her in seven moves. Now others wanted to try their hand, seeing how many moves it would take to best her. This way, they could gauge whose skills truly stood out.

Thus, these people were using Zou Wuhui as a benchmark for their abilities—essentially treating her as a living target for practice.

Zou Wuhui sighed. Neither approach worked. She truly didn’t know how to word this notice anymore. These people clearly had no intention of accepting the mission; they were all here to cause trouble.

In the end, Zou Wuhui added one final line at the bottom of the notice: “No idlers, thank you!”

Realizing Zou Wuhui wouldn’t indulge them further, the crowd gradually dispersed.

“Let me try. Perhaps I’m truly qualified.”

Turning around, Zou Wuhui saw a woman around forty years old with an ordinary appearance—the type who’d vanish in a crowd. Her plain features matched her simple attire, revealing nothing remarkable. She carried a slender sword, its scuttle particularly narrow and elongated.

Zou Wuhui smiled. Finally, someone normal had arrived—someone who clearly knew martial arts. At least hiring one person meant her trip wasn’t wasted.

“This mission involves escorting someone safely from Silver Town to the capital. The journey will be perilous. Are you willing to take the risk?” Zou Wuhui asked first, wary the woman might also be here for a spar.

“Yes, I understand. It’s essentially serving as a bodyguard, correct? I believe I’m capable,” the woman replied confidently.

Zou Wuhui nodded. “Excellent. Let’s exchange a few moves first, if you don’t mind. I’d like to assess your skills.”

“No need for sparring. My abilities surpass yours.” As soon as the words left her mouth, the woman’s slender sword hissed from its scabbard. With a flick of her wrist, the blade circled through the air and came to rest against Zou Wuhui’s throat.

The woman’s movement was lightning-fast. Before Zou Wuhui could react, the cold steel already pressed against her skin, sending a chill down her spine. This single move proved the woman’s formidable skill.

“Well then, what fee do you deem appropriate for this escort mission?” Zou Wuhui asked cheerfully. After all this time, finally securing a hire was no small feat.

“I care not whom we escort or where. My rate is ten taels of silver per day—not a coin less. Additionally, if personal matters arise, I’ll terminate the mission and depart immediately.”

Zou Wuhui hadn’t anticipated such terms. Ten taels daily was steep, but the woman’s skill justified the price. The only concern was her potential abrupt departure mid-mission.

“If you accept a mission, shouldn’t you see it through? What becomes of the protected party if you leave halfway?” Zou Wuhui countered.

“Didn’t you say earlier that I won’t be the sole protector? If I leave, others will remain,” the woman replied, sheathing her sword. “Truthfully, I only came because I’m idle. Consider this an outing. If these terms displease you, we can part ways now.”

“I don’t object entirely, but we must establish rules,” Zou Wuhui said.

“What rules?”

“Ten taels daily—agreed. However, payment for each day will be given on the following morning. Otherwise, if I pay you at dawn and you leave by noon, I’d be at a loss.”

Delaying payment by a day seemed fairer. The woman was right—the protection didn’t hinge on one person. Her presence might ease dangers, but Zou Wuhui needed safeguards against sudden departures.

“Acceptable. I won’t deceive you. Should I need to leave, I’ll inform you beforehand,” the woman conceded.

“Then it’s settled. Gather at the inn’s entrance before nightfall. I’ll continue recruiting here.” Relieved to have secured at least one hire, Zou Wuhui added, “Might I ask your name?”

“Of course. I’m Zhan Liang (Occupying Beam).” With that, the woman departed. Despite her plain appearance, she exuded reliability unlike others with cunning features.

“Zhan Liang…” Zou Wuhui murmured. “Sounds rather masculine.”

As she resumed waiting, many diners in the adjacent hall showed little interest in her notice. Zou Wuhui couldn’t fathom why mediocre cultivators lingered here when they stood no chance against the Swordless Immortal—the world’s foremost martial artist. Why waste time at this inn unless it offered free lodging?

This perplexed not just Zou Wuhui but many others. The Swordless Inn attracted both true masters preparing to challenge the legendary figure and mediocre hopefuls seeking mentors. Some came to profit through schemes or information peddling—a motley crew of opportunists.

Chapter 4188: Feeble-Minded

A hunched, emaciated old man approached, his wrinkled face resembling a crumpled parchment. “What’re you escorting? Any hiring conditions?”

Zou Wuhui suppressed a shudder at his skeletal frame. “The client’s identity is confidential. The only requirement is defeating me in combat.”

The man studied her earnestly. “Our skills seem evenly matched—both mediocre. Shall we test this?”

Though the man appeared frail, Zou Wuhui agreed. After prolonged sparring, she barely triumphed by striking his back during a turn.

“Clearly I’m no match. Farewell.” The man bowed politely.

Impressed by his decorum despite his appearance, Zou Wuhui called out, “Wait! I’ll hire you. Twenty taels upon safely reaching the capital.”

She named the price without negotiation, deeming it fair for his modest skills. The journey typically took four to five days—generous compensation at four to five taels daily.

The man turned, smiling. “I’ll guard the target diligently, but might the payment…”

To Zou Wuhui’s surprise, he requested less: “Five taels daily suffices.”

Baffled by his poor bargaining, Zou Wuhui agreed. “Deal. Gather at the inn entrance at dusk. With you, I’ve hired two. How may I address you?”

“Call me Brother Fan.” He lingered. “How many guards do you seek?”

“The more the better. The road holds many dangers—numbers ensure safety. Silver isn’t an issue for the capable.”

“I have friends here. Let me inquire.” Brother Fan departed, returning later with three companions—all hired at five taels daily.

By sunset, Zou Wuhui had recruited five. The crimson western horizon promised fair weather tomorrow. At the Swordless Inn’s entrance, she awaited her party, having rejected overpriced hires whose skills didn’t justify exorbitant fees.

Chapter 4189: Full Gallop

As dusk fell, Zou Wuhui led her group toward Silver Town. Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong wandered the rice-paddy-dominated settlement, its streets lined with granaries and inns catering to grain merchants.

“How dreary here,” Wang complained.

Before Guan Yu could respond, hoofbeats approached. Zou Wuhui’s party arrived—far smaller than the twenty-strong guard lost to Imperial Guards.

“Only these few?” Wang frowned.

“Lord Zou must decide sufficiency,” Guan Yu said. “Perhaps we depart tomorrow.”

“Let’s leave then! This place suffocates me.”

As they conversed, Zou Wuhui’s voice carried: “We ride hard—Silver Town lies two hours’ gallop away!”

The fading light gilded the rice fields, the evening breeze carrying promises of danger and dawn’s swift horses.
