The burly man was just about to extend his sinister hand to grab Wang Xiaorong behind Guan Yu. Towering in stature and matching Guan Yu's height, he radiated formidable strength. Though aware Guan Yu was a cultivator, the man believed spellcasters held no advantage in close combat. Seeing Guan Yu's lean frame, he dismissed him as no threat.

As the man reached for Wang Xiaorong, Guan Yu assessed the five or six hulking brutes—impressive in bulk but lacking true skill. He immediately lifted his foot to kick the approaching assailant. The man swiftly retracted his hand and seized Guan Yu's ankle mid-kick. Surprise flashed through Guan Yu—this brute's reflexes defied expectations.

With a vicious grin, the man twisted his wrist, intent on snapping the captured ankle. Empowered by their madam's patronage, these thugs showed no restraint as long as they avoided killing. Their lustful gazes lingered on the delicate yet fiery maiden behind Guan Yu, imagining carnal rewards if they subdued her.

Struggling against the iron grip, Guan Yu realized escape required finesse. Another brute lunged not at Wang Xiaorong, but threw a punch aimed at Guan Yu's knee—a strike that could shatter bone. Pivoting on his trapped right foot, Guan Yu launched himself airborne. His body spun horizontally, wrenching free from the grip as both feet slammed into the first attacker's chest. Before landing, he twisted again, delivering a flying kick to the second assailant's neck.

The second brute shook off the blow, trapping Guan Yu's foot against his neck. Palms hitting ground, Guan Yu vaulted upward and unleashed a flurry of kicks, sending the man staggering back. These strikes carried bone-crushing force—even the hardiest ribs would crack under such punishment. As the first attacker wailed on the ground, others swarmed Guan Yu undeterred.

Relieved their focus remained on him, Guan Yu moved like water through their clumsy assaults. Though his internal energy ran low, pure martial skill sufficed against these brawlers. Limbs flew in controlled fury as four more thugs collapsed. The madam's face darkened—this cultivator's close combat prowess shattered expectations.

"Enough!" Guan Yu declared, pointing at the remaining lackeys. "Even united, you insects can't touch me. Let this end before consequences engulf you all."

Wang Xiaorong stood untouched behind him, gazing at his protective silhouette with awe. The madam's lip curled. "Think brute force impresses me?" sneered a long-chinned man beside her, his protruding jaw adding comic menace. "Wait till garrison troops arrive—they'll wear you down like pack wolves!"

Guan Yu's laugh rang cold. "Call your precious magistrate's dogs. Royal guardsmen wouldn't make me blink." He turned comforting eyes to Wang Xiaorong. "None shall harm a hair on your head, even if the whole garrison comes."

The madam spat, "Insolent pup! Kowtow thrice and I might spare you."

"Delusional hag," Guan Yu retorted. "Your shrimp soldiers lie broken. What other tricks hide up your sleeve?"

As fallen thugs groaned upright, Guan Yu noted their resilience—these weren't ordinary ruffians. Yet their pained movements betrayed spent strength. The madam's scorn fell heavy: "Useless oafs! What good are muscles without skill?"

Guan Yu seized the moment. "Even dogs deserve care when wounded. Where's their physician?"

"Meddle not!" the madam snapped. "These failures deserve their pain."

Her words kindled rebellion in the injured men's eyes. Guan Yu pressed, "They bled for you—show basic humanity!"

"Humanity?" She laughed cruelly. "These worms aren't worth dog's gruel!"

Tension thickened as even her allies shifted uncomfortably. Guan Yu's words exposed the rot beneath the madam's power—a rot now laid bare before henchmen and onlookers alike. The stage was set not just for physical combat, but a reckoning of loyalties.
