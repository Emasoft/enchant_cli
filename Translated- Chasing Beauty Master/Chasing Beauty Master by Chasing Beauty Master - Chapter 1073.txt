Lin Qiaoqiao immediately mobilized two vehicles of fully armed personnel and headed towards the Fang residence. She trusted Guan Yu's words completely – such grave matters couldn't be baseless jokes.

As they arrived at the Fang estate's main gate, Ganbili – having already received Guan Yu's orders – lurked in the shadows, watching the police swarm into the compound.

Typical police procedure – blaring sirens from afar to alert their targets before arriving. By then, whoever needed fleeing would have fled, and those meant to die would already be dead.

Fang Su paced frantically in the parlor. With so many officers barging in, discovering the two injured men would spell disaster. Even with a hundred mouths, he couldn't explain this away.

The Poisonous Widow, skilled in medicine, was hastily bandaging the wounded. She'd just extracted a bullet from one man's shoulder when the police stormed in.

"You imbeciles! You must've been followed!" the Poisonous Widow hissed.

"What now? The police will break in any moment!" Fang Su's voice trembled with panic.

"Buy time!" she snapped. "Nephew, stall them. You two – escape through the back with A Gou (Ah Dog). Move!"

The wounded men staggered up despite their injuries. A Gou, the Poisonous Widow's right-hand man – more comrade than subordinate – stood ready. Their relationship defied hierarchy; he commanded equal authority.

"A Gou! Get them out now!" she ordered. The wolf-raised man, his brute strength evident, hauled both men toward the rear exit.

Two years prior, A Gou had saved the Poisonous Widow from assassins in mountain forests. Abandoned as a child and raised by wolves, he communicated through growls until she civilized him. Now he drove skillfully, having mastered urban survival.

At the front gates, after repeated obstructions, Lin Qiaoqiao barked: "Prepare to breach!"

Rifles clicked in unison as officers leveled weapons. Facing cold steel barrels, the Fang household yielded passage.

Barging into the parlor, Lin Qiaoqiao found three figures – her despised Fang Su, his father, and a middle-aged woman.

Fang Su's eyes lit up. "Qiaoqiao! Miss me so much you brought an entourage?"

The Poisonous Widow initially relaxed, assuming their acquaintance – until Lin Qiaoqiao spat: "Shut your filthy mouth! We're here for two fugitives. Tear this place apart!"

The Fang family maintained aristocratic composure. The patriarch stood. "Officer, where's your warrant? This is unlawful intrusion!"

Fang Su chimed in: "Yes! Abuse of power! You're just settling personal scores!"

Lin Qiaoqiao's gaze fell on bloodied gauze in a wastebasket. "Whose blood is this?"

The Poisonous Widow countered smoothly: "Mine from a nosebleed. Does that violate any laws?"

"Shall we test that blood type?" Lin Qiaoqiao retorted, watching her opponent's face closely.

Returning officers reported no sign of wounded. As doubt crept in, Guan Yu's call redirected them to the rear river exit.

There, A Gou's escape attempt collapsed when a mysterious black van blocked the bridge. Forced to abandon their vehicle, the trio squeezed past – only to be knocked into deep waters by sudden doors.

The injured men floundered while A Gou – a landlubber raised in treetops – clung to bridge pilings. As Lin Qiaoqiao's team arrived with searchlights, the van vanished like a phantom.

Hauled back dripping, the captives faced Lin Qiaoqiao's triumph: "Still want to sue me for trespassing?"

Fang Su trembled, realizing his family's ruin. The Poisonous Widow pivoted: "Thank heavens you caught these thugs! They forced us at gunpoint!"

Lin Qiaoqiao ignored the charade, eyeing A Gou. "Who's this?"

"He's mute," the Poisonous Widow interjected. "They took him hostage!"

As Lin Qiaoqiao scrutinized their lies, the Poisonous Widow's mind raced – two loyal soldiers sacrificed, but the real battle was just beginning.
