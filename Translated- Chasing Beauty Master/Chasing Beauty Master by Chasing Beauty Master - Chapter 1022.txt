“I thought this should be a good opportunity, so I sent my men to tail Guan Yu. First, we arranged people to get close to him and lull his vigilance. After confirming he truly had no other forces around him, we prepared to strike.

In the police car, my men fired at Guan Yu when he was completely off guard... but failed. Guan Yu’s reflexes were quicker than a rabbit’s, and he must have already suspected the people I placed near him.

After several missed shots, the sniper I had hidden in the shadows tried to take aim but couldn’t lock onto Guan Yu’s position.

Perhaps due to Guan Yu’s high cultivation level and his strong premonition of danger, the hidden sniper’s first shot went wide, hitting the roof of the police car. Immediately after, Guan Yu vanished from sight.”

After hearing Bill Lin’s account, everyone fell into contemplative silence. None had imagined that even such elaborate measures couldn’t kill Guan Yu. Sister Ji remarked, “Could it be that the men you assigned were simply incompetent?”

Bill Lin shot her a disdainful look. “If you think everyone in the Bill family is a fool, then I’d genuinely like to know—which family’s members aren’t fools?”

Ge Yinglai had also heard about the incident—the hijacking of the police car. However, the matter had been kept under wraps. Normally, such a major event would have caused an uproar, with news outlets broadcasting it nonstop.

But the local authorities had suppressed it. After all, it was a disgrace to the police force—an attack on a police vehicle. If word got out, it might panic the public.

What Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated was that Bill Lin had orchestrated the ambush. He’d initially assumed the attackers were sent by the human traffickers’ backers seeking revenge.

In truth, Guan Yu remained unaware of many details. The police car attack had indeed been arranged by Bill Lin, but it was also instigated by the traffickers’ masterminds—for the Bill family was one of those very backers.

At the time, Guan Yu had rushed to meet Yingzi and Second Only to Wolf. The assailants who showed up at Second Only to Wolf’s residence hadn’t come for revenge against him—they’d targeted Guan Yu.

Had Bill Lin not revealed these details today, no one would have ever known.

Sun Xu gritted his teeth. “No matter what, we can’t waver in our resolve to deal with Guan Yu. If he lives, our days of peace are over. I suggest arranging snipers in hidden positions. Perhaps when Guan Yu is driving, they’ll find an opportunity to eliminate him.”

Bill Lin shook his head again. “When Guan Yu stormed the Feng family, he was trapped in the south building with six snipers watching his every move. The moment he stepped out, he should’ve been shot—yet he escaped right under their noses.

Moreover, Guan Yu’s car is bulletproof—the windows and body are specially reinforced. When he’s inside, snipers pose no threat. His vigilance is extraordinarily high, likely due to his cultivation. He senses danger long before it manifests.”

Ge Yinglai drained his wineglass in frustration, his expression gloomy. If this approach failed and that method didn’t work, how could so many of them lack a viable plan to handle Guan Yu?

He slumped onto the sofa, his tone sharp. “By your logic, Guan Yu might as well be invincible. If that’s the case, why bother opposing him? It’s meaningless if we can’t touch him.”

**Chapter 2613: Sightseeing Everywhere**

“Don’t speak so hastily,” Fang Su interjected. “I refuse to believe Guan Yu remains alert every second. However formidable he is, he’s still flesh and blood—not a deity. As long as he’s human, we can deal with him.”

Fang Su’s tone suggested he had an idea. Sister Ji pressed, “Share your plan. Let’s hear it.”

“My method is simple: wait for Guan Yu to go out, then dispatch people to separate him from his companions. Once he’s alone, he’ll be vulnerable. The catch is we’ll need patience. For Guan Yu’s death, I believe waiting is worthwhile.”

Bill Lin added, “I think the days before the Yang family’s auction present a prime opportunity. Guan Yu will likely move around frequently, giving us ample chances.”

Just then, Bill Lin’s phone rang. Upon answering, a voice reported, “Young Master, Guan Yu is currently driving around aimlessly. We suspect he’s detected us. Requesting permission to withdraw and reposition.”

“Good. Return and report his location. I’ll assign others to continue surveillance.” After hanging up, Bill Lin addressed the group. “Perhaps today brings the opportunity we seek. Guan Yu is reportedly cruising the city—isn’t this ideal timing?”

“What are we waiting for? Mobilize the men,” Sun Xu urged. Thus, the group reached an agreement: they would unite to eliminate Guan Yu and eradicate this threat once and for all.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu continued touring the city with Shuangshuang, who marveled at everything. Having spent most of her time confined to the hospital with her mother, this outing was a rare freedom.

With Guan Yu as her escort, Shuangshuang indulged fully. At every eye-catching spot, she’d ask to stop, explore, then resume their journey.

Her phone battery died from excessive photo-taking, so she borrowed Xue Jing’s power bank. “Wow, this is amazing! You can charge anywhere?” Shuangshuang admired the device.

Xue Jing smiled. “Exactly. If you like it, I’ll gift it to you.” The imported Apple-branded power bank, sleek and durable, clearly delighted the girl.

“I couldn’t possibly accept. I’ll return it after charging,” Shuangshuang declined politely.

Guan Yu chimed in, “If Sister Jing offers, take it. She can buy another later.”

Shuangshuang beamed, no longer refusing. “Then... let Sister Jing get a new one first. Otherwise, she’ll be without if there’s an emergency.”

Xue Jing chuckled, surprised by the girl’s maturity. “No need. It’s yours now. I can charge in the car if needed.” She demonstrated the power bank’s features as Shuangshuang listened intently.

By 6 PM, after hours of exploration and souvenirs, Guan Yu suggested dinner. “What would you like, Shuangshuang? Big Brother will treat you.”

Though playful, Shuangshuang remained considerate, often hesitating when offered gifts. Guan Yu and Xue Jing had to guess her preferences.

“I’m not hungry yet. Let’s keep exploring! I’ll eat with Mom at the hospital later,” she protested, fearing an early end to the adventure.

Xue Jing saw through her. “We’ll need energy to keep going. Let’s eat something light.”

Blushing, Shuangshuang conceded. “Alright. Anything’s fine.”

Guan Yu gestured to a street stall. “How about grilled skewers?”

Xue Jing vetoed, “Let’s introduce her to new cuisine.” She pointed across the street. “That restaurant looks decent. The environment should be pleasant.”

Nodding, Guan Yu parked at Yougui Restaurant. The trio settled in a quiet private room. Though summer heat favored outdoor stalls, the restaurant’s ambiance suited their needs.

Xue Jing ordered six sophisticated dishes. Shuangshuang, petite, filled quickly, rubbing her stomach after few bites. “Let’s pack leftovers for her mother,” Xue Jing proposed.

“Mom’s never tasted such delicacies! She’ll be thrilled. Thank you both—you’ve given me so many firsts. I’m so happy!” Shuangshuang glowed.

**Chapter 2614: Don’t Embarrass Yourself, Okay?**

Her joy warmed Guan Yu’s heart. Post-dinner, they resumed their tour, eventually reaching the southern district’s abandoned construction site—now refurbished as the Yu Gang’s headquarters.

“Let me introduce you to some friends,” Guan Yu suggested.

“Yes!” Shuangshuang agreed eagerly. The renovated compound, complete with perimeter walls and guarded gates, impressed Guan Yu. The warehouse now featured partitioned offices for gang leaders.

As Guan Yu parked, sentries alerted the gang. Jia Bo hurried out. “Boss! What brings you here? Trouble?”

“Can’t I visit without trouble? I’m showing my little sister around.” Guan Yu exited, followed by Shuangshuang.

Jia Bo’s gaze lingered on the girl. “Just... sightseeing?” His appreciative stare prompted Guan Yu to flick his forehead. “Control yourself. You’re embarrassing us.”

Shuangshuang hid behind Xue Jing, giggling. Jia Bo bowed apologetically. “My apologies, young miss. I’ll leave you to tour.” He retreated hastily.

“Don’t worry,” Guan Yu reassured. “They’re just lonely bachelors. None will dare misbehave.” Leading them inside, gang members respectfully greeted “Boss” at every turn.

Shuangshuang whispered to Xue Jing, “Why do they fear Big Brother?”

“Maybe because he’s stronger... or commands loyalty,” Xue Jing replied uncertainly.

Finding the hideout dull, they soon departed. As evening fell, Xue Jing suggested the bustling downtown night market. Reluctantly, Guan Yu agreed—crowds weren’t his preference, but Shuangshuang’s excitement won out.
