Stopping Song Ziyu who still wanted to slap someone, he stood up and walked to Li Xi's side, reaching out to touch her crimson cheek. At that moment, the door was kicked open with a crash.

A mountain-like burly man was hurled through the doorway, smashing heavily onto the delicate glass table and scattering shards across the floor.

"Dashan?" Li Zilong narrowed his eyes, glancing at the groaning man on the floor before turning his gaze to the newcomers—Guan Yu, Lin Dong, and Cao Xiping.

"So you're the mastermind backing the Song family!"

During their journey here, Guan Yu had already extracted the full story from the captured thug. He knew the man before him was the architect of Li Xi's kidnapping.

"Choose your manner of death!"

Li Zilong, surprised by Guan Yu's swift arrival, recovered quickly and clapped mockingly. "Young Master Song warned me you'd be troublesome. I didn't believe him at first, but finding this place so quickly? I must admit your competence."

"Flattery won't absolve your crimes!"

The moment he entered, Guan Yu's fury ignited upon seeing the bound hostages—especially Li Xi's crimson palm-marked cheek. This woman was his chosen partner. Whoever dared strike her courted death!

Dismissing further talk with Li Zilong, Guan Yu gestured to Lin Dong before moving to untie the captives. Lin Dong, simmering with rage since his own captivity, materialized a gleaming dagger as he advanced on the kidnapper.

Watching this approaching avatar of vengeance, Li Zilong's forehead glistened with cold sweat. "Guan Yu! I'm from the Li family! Harm me and they'll—"

His empty threat dissolved as Guan Yu escorted Li Xi outside. Before the door closed completely, Li Zilong's agonized scream pierced the air, mingling with Song Ziyu's terrified shrieks.

"Does it hurt?" Guan Yu's fury resurged seeing the handprint on Li Xi's face, imagining hurling Li Zilong from the rooftop.

She shook her head, finding unexpected comfort in his calloused palm caressing her cheek, no longer resisting his intimate gesture.

Watching their tender exchange, Cao Xiping made exaggerated gagging noises until Guan Yu cuffed him playfully. "Let's go home."

After returning Li Xi and Jiang Yiyi to their hotel and packing essentials, the group crossed the border back to mainland China once Lin Dong rejoined them.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong media broadcast breaking news: Zeya Industrial's Sales Manager Li Zilong found unconscious in his apartment with broken arms, rumors swirling about vengeful assailants. More salaciously, tabloids reported him discovered embracing his sister-in-law Song Ziyu...

Within an hour of these reports, Zeya's stock plummeted. Simultaneously, Hong Kong's Labor Commission received whistleblower evidence of the company's illegal overtime practices and wage theft.

Academics and pundits emerged like cicadas after rain, condemning Zeya as a sweatshop empire.

Chapter 1068: Return to Capital

Flying directly from Guangzhou to Beijing, Guan Yu found himself on the Wen family's sofa within hours. Contrary to expectations, his father-in-law Wen Baoguo wore not despair but stern disapproval.

"Father-in-law, you look unwell. Need some acupuncture?" Guan Yu offered with forced cheer.

The elder Wens and Lius had retreated to a veteran's sanatorium for "discussions," while Wen Qing shopped with Zhao Jinger. Though tensions ran high, Beijing's political restraints offered more protection than Hong Kong's lawlessness.

Alone with Wen Baoguo, Guan Yu endured the older man's glare. "You're a walking disaster! Provoking both mainland and Taiwan Song clans? Don't you know the Taiwan branch holds more influence? Thanks to you, I'm on 'administrative leave'—permanent if this isn't resolved!"

"Your solution?" Wen Baoguo demanded.

"Meet force with force. Should I grovel when they attack us?" Guan Yu shrugged. Surrender wasn't in his vocabulary unless the sun rose west.

"Be serious!" Wen Baoguo's vein pulsed dangerously. "This is beyond apologies!"

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. "Stop worrying. Use your vacation trying for a grandson before the elders skin you alive."

The reminder deflated Wen Baoguo. Against the combined Song-Li alliance, even a minister's power proved limited. "Fine. But harm Wen Qing, and—"

"Enough! She's my wife—I protect what's mine." Guan Yu's confidence stemmed from unseen stratagems. Beneath Beijing's calm surface, undercurrents raged.

Commerce and politics became battlegrounds. The Dongs and Songs clashed economically while the Wangs and Jiangs politically assailed Song allies. Opportunists reaped promotions, oblivious to impending backlash.

The architect of this chaos meanwhile endured marital shopping punishment, buried under bags while his wives hunted boutiques. "Lunch?" he ventured weakly.

"Hungry?" Wen Qing smiled sweetly, eyes promising violence.

Shuddering, Guan Yu denied starvation. Zhao Jinger's pitying suggestion to "leave bags in the car" proved equally lethal.

His self-pitying lamentation shattered by an unwelcome voice: "Isn't that Guan Yu?"

Chen Si sneered to Wen Ya, "See? Petty as ever." Accompanying them were Qin Tian and a dandyish newcomer—Chen Si's latest beau.

Guan Yu's heart clenched seeing Wen Ya with Qin Tian. Had they...?

"Guan Yu!" Qin Tian called mockingly. "No greeting for old friends?"

"We're not friends." Guan Yu turned away, seeking escape.

"Come now," Qin Tian pressed. "Join us at Wangfujing's five-star hotel. Let me thank you for... past services to my girlfriend."

The barb struck true. "Girlfriend?" Guan Yu's gaze pinned Wen Ya.

"I..." she began, but Qin Tian interjected: "Yes! We'd hate to feast without you—and your mystery lady."

Smelling revenge, Guan Yu accepted. Let them regret this invitation.

Chapter 1069: Reunion with Wen Ya

Qin Tian's smirk widened. This pauper's partner would be some shopgirl—perfect humiliation material. When Guan Yu mentioned awaiting his "wives," the group scoffed but waited.

As minutes dragged, Chen Si's boyfriend Zheng Chaoyang snapped: "Your woman keeps us waiting?"

"Did I ask you to wait?" Guan Yu retorted without looking up.

Zheng surged up, fist clenched, until Chen Si restrained him. Wen Ya, knowing Guan Yu's capabilities, urged departure to prevent violence.

"Come to lunch if you dare!" Zheng spat as they left.

Guan Yu smiled coldly. Oh, he'd come—and make them regret every word.

Later, finding Wen Qing in a menswear shop, Guan Yu balked at the white suit she proffered. "Too... pristine."

"Try it!" Her glare brooked no refusal. Resigned, he envisioned Qin Tian's coming humiliation. Today's lunch would be... memorable.
