“Damn it, don’t let me find out who snitched, or I’ll make them pay,” Wang Zhen fumed through gritted teeth.

“Hey, Wang Zhen—why aren’t you at your desk? What are you doing by Guan Yu? Get back now!” Liu Gang’s sharp voice cut through the air.

“Are you two conspiring to cheat?” Liu Gang seized the opportunity to grandstand. “Let me warn you—if I catch either of you cheating, you’ll be expelled. This school won’t tolerate trash like you!”

Still seething, Wang Zhen silenced Liu Gang with a venomous glare, forcing the man to swallow his next words. Later, even Liu Gang himself couldn’t explain why a student’s stare had chilled him to the bone.

“Time’s up. Begin the exam,” Liu Gang barked.

Unaware of the brewing storm, students passed exam papers backward with relaxed smiles. Zhao Jing’er, seated in front of Guan Yu, handed him his sheet with cheeks still flushed.

Guan Yu accepted it with a grin. “Write fast. Everyone’s counting on you.”

Zhao Jing’er wrinkled her delicate nose, turned away, and buried herself in the test. For most students, the early exam period was mere theater—some gnawed pencils in mock concentration, others scribbled aimlessly, while a few simply zoned out.

Guan Yu belonged to the last group, though his “zoning out” involved covertly observing classmates’ expressions, brows occasionally furrowing. His darting eyes only confirmed Liu Gang’s suspicions. The teacher stomped to Guan Yu’s desk and rapped the surface. “Stop looking around. Focus on your test.”

Leaning forward, Guan Yu squinted up at him. “Since when do you police how I take exams? Playing the diligent administrator must be exhausting.”

Liu Gang’s face darkened at the jab. He snorted and retreated, though remained hovering nearby. When Guan Yu finally grabbed his pen, Liu Gang watched hawk-like as the student completed the entire exam in ten minutes—an impossibility without cheating, he thought triumphantly.

Snatching the paper, Liu Gang tore through Guan Yu’s desk and even crawled under it searching for evidence. Finding nothing, his eyes lit with new suspicion. “If it’s not here, it must be on him!”

As Liu Gang lunged to pat him down, Guan Yu’s foot shot out. A bloodcurdling scream shattered the silence as Liu Gang crumpled, clutching his groin. The class erupted in laughter.

No student moved to help the despised administrator. Even the other proctor, Chen Ming, struggled to feign concern. After minimal medical examination revealed potential… performance implications, Liu Gang howled threats from his hospital bed.

“You’re finished, Guan Yu! Expulsion and jail await!”

Guan Yu merely smirked. “Self-defense, Director Liu. Let’s see who the police believe.” Dialing Police Commissioner Nie, he added, “Bring your lunch—no rush.”

When the principal arrived, tensions crackled. Meanwhile, back in the classroom, Wang Zhen counted five minutes after Guan Yu’s covert hand signal before announcing: “Copy away! Let’s all ace this and shove it in that turtle’s face!”

As students swarmed Zhao Jing’er’s perfect answers, Guan Yu sat calmly through Liu Gang’s theatrics. Let the cameras roll—they’d show nothing but a teacher’s humiliation and a classroom triumph.

*To win hearts is to win the world; to lose them is to lose all.*

**Chapter 566: Framed**
While cheers echoed in the exam hall, the hospital room echoed with threats. “I’ll have you jailed!” Liu Gang spat.

Guan Yu’s smile never wavered. “Call your corrupt brother-in-law cop. I’ve invited someone… impartial.” As Commissioner Nie’s arrival loomed, the real test of power began—and Guan Yu held all the answers.
