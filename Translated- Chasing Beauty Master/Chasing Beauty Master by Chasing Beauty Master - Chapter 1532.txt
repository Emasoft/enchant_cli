“Your words are indeed correct, but we’ve overlooked one crucial detail,” Zou Wuhei explained. “Our adversaries were cunning enough to use a special poison. Consuming tea alone causes no harm, nor does eating the dishes alone. Only when both are consumed together does the toxin take effect. Thus, we were all deceived.”

The third squad leader, having just regained consciousness, slumped down gasping for breath, his face etched with worry as he felt his strength still hadn’t fully returned.

Wang Jun glanced at the hapless group and remarked, “You’re truly unfortunate. Not only are the Crown Prince and Second Prince sending assassins after you, but you’ve also fallen into bandits’ traps here. Heh… What spectacular bad luck.”

Though stung by Wang Jun’s mockery, none dared retort. They had indeed been outwitted and now relied on these strangers’ aid once more. Moreover, with the Prince’s condition still uncertain, anxiety hung heavy in the air.

While everyone understood the implications of Wang Jun’s mention of the Crown Prince and Second Prince, the hired killers operated in shadows and masks. Without concrete evidence, reckless accusations were unwise.

“There’s no need to worry,” Wang Jun continued. “The Prince will be safe. With us here, we’ll ensure his protection.”

“Why help us?” Zou Wuhei cautiously pressed. “You’re clearly neither commoners nor mere do-gooders. You sought us out deliberately. Are you agents of the princes?”

“What does it matter who we are?” Wang Jun scoffed. “Had we wished you harm, you’d all be greeting King Yama by now. Not one of you would’ve survived.”

Without Guan Yu’s assistance, this group stood no chance. Their mediocre skills and dim wits made them easy prey for the numerically superior, though less skilled, mercenaries pursuing them.

Zou Wuhei fell silent, conceding the point. If these strangers meant them ill, they could’ve acted long ago.

As Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi returned with Prince Zou supported between them, the retainers’ spirits lifted instantly. They scrambled to kowtow in apology.

Xiao Zhi had intercepted the fleeing kidnappers with supernatural ease, leaving them trembling and surrendering. After using spiritual energy to revive the Prince, they’d returned promptly.

“Rise,” the Prince commanded wearily. “This wasn’t your fault. Once again, these young heroes have saved me.” He began to kneel in gratitude, but Guan Yu blocked the motion with his foot.

“No need for such formalities, Your Highness. We’re undeserving of your obeisance. Save your knees – I’ve no wish to shorten my lifespan.”

Through discreet qi application, Guan Yu compelled the Prince upright, maintaining appearances while only the Prince understood the true dynamic.

“How can I ever repay you?” the Prince sighed. “Twice in one day you’ve saved my life. Though you refuse my prostration, know this: any request you make, I shall fulfill. Name your desire, and this prince will move heaven and earth to achieve it.”

Guan Yu recognized genuine gratitude. The Prince’s reputation as an upright ruler who served his people well in Liaozhou proved accurate – a man worth protecting.

“Better words than before,” Xiao Zhi grunted. “Just don’t make our efforts feel wasted.”

Guan Yu produced vials from the captives. “These should be antidotes. Each of you take one.”

No one hesitated now. Having witnessed their capabilities and goodwill, the group swallowed the pills without question. Soon, color returned to their faces, including Zou Wuxiao’s as Guan Yu revived him.

“Where are your manners?” the Prince chided. “No gratitude for your saviors?”

Zou Wuxiao, who’d been sizing up the mysterious trio, hastily bowed. “My deepest thanks for this life-debt.”

“Save formalities,” Guan Yu interrupted. “This bamboo grove swarms with enemies. Now that you’re recovered, we must make haste for Lianzhou City before nightfall.”

The Prince agreed. With midday passing, reaching urban safety before dark was paramount. Though Zou Wuxiao’s recklessness caused this debacle, recriminations could wait. Survival came first.

Thus Guan Yu’s trio seamlessly integrated into the Prince’s retinue. While suspicions lingered about their origins, their repeated rescues spoke louder than doubts. Had they wished the Prince harm, countless opportunities existed.

During travel, Guan Yu learned more of imperial intrigues. Though distantly stationed in Liaozhou, the Prince remained embroiled in palace politics. His honorary title bred surface respect but secret resentment.

“Your Highness!” the head guard called. “Five li to Lianzhou! We must quicken pace to arrive before dusk.”

As the group hurried, Guan Yu pressed, “Why not petition the Emperor for protection? These attacks clearly come from princely factions.”

The Prince smiled bitterly. “The Emperor uses me as bait to gauge their ambitions. My survival proves their limits. No evidence exists – only corpses in shadows.”

Guan Yu’s thoughts turned to succession rumors. If protecting this Prince meant future imperial favors...

Chapter 3974: The Foolish One

Meanwhile in the palace, a shrill announcement echoed: “Her Majesty the Empress arrives!”

Courtiers prostrated as a lavishly armored woman entered, her blood-red lips glaring against thick cosmetics. Though middle-aged, meticulous保养 preserved her beauty.

“Leave us,” the Empress commanded, settling on her dais. “Only my son remains.”

The retreating侍女 revealed the Second Prince – a gaunt man radiating arrogant nobility through upturned eyes that betrayed cunning cruelty.

“Well?” The Empress’s voice cut like ice. “Has Qì Dàrén resolved the Zou matter?”

“He awaits outside with news,” the Prince replied, summoning the minister.

Minister Qì entered trembling. “This humble servant failed! The Prince escaped again. Our mercenaries proved inadequate against his loyal guards.”

“Useless!” The Empress’s jeweled hand slammed armrest. “The Imperial Guards I nurtured – wasted on incompetents! How does a provincial lord outmaneuver you?”

“His retainers fight like demons, Your Majesty! They sacrifice limbs to protect him. But fear not – next I’ll deploy our elite forces.”

The Second Prince interjected coldly, “Fail again, and your head shall decorate palace gates. The throne cannot risk Zou reaching the capital.”

Minister Qì kowtowed frantically. “The next ambush near Lianzhou will succeed! I stake my life on it!”

“See that you do,” the Empress purred. “Remember – your faction’s survival depends on this. Should Zou ascend, your entire clique will be purged.”

After dismissing the minister, the Prince mused, “Elder Brother’s faction remains quiet. Does First Prince’s tutor Yú Kōng truly idle?”

The Empress smirked. “Yú Kōng moves in deeper shadows. As Chief Eunuch, his web spans decades. We’ll let him weaken Zou first, then crush both rivals.”

In another palace wing, the First Prince argued with his mother, Noble Consort Guìfēn. Towering at nearly two meters, his dull eyes reflected simple-minded frustration.

“Must we scheme endlessly?” he groaned. “I’ve no mind for politics! Let Second Brother have the throne!”

Consort Guìfēn, her willowy frame draped in pink silks, sighed. “Child, if we don’t act, we’ll suffer when he purges us! Would you see your mother cast into cold palaces?”

“But I forget today’s lessons by tomorrow!” The Prince gestured helplessly. “What king forgets his own edicts? The throne needs cleverness I lack!”

The Consort’s jeweled nails dug into her palms. Her son’s simplicity, inherited from her peasant-born father, now threatened their survival. Yet she persisted – for without the throne, they were lambs awaiting slaughter.

As sunset gilded Lianzhou’s walls, Guan Yu’s group approached the city gates. Bamboo forests rustled with unseen threats, but ahead lay temporary sanctuary. For now.
