Guan Yu subtly furrowed his brows, finding this matter equally troubling. After prolonged contemplation yielded no solutions, he could only shake his head in resignation.

"Creating problems where none exist! Though Elder Griffin initiated the challenge, none of this would've happened if Guan Yu hadn't gotten involved with the Jade Stone Gate!" Lin Hui remarked, arching an eyebrow. Seated nearby, Guan Yu lifted his gaze toward the voice's origin. If memory served, this slick-haired fellow was Lin Xi—son of Uncle Lin Hui, a first-tier Gold Fighter with decent talent but a penchant for bullying the weak. During Guan Yu's earlier "useless" days, this bootlicker had tormented him relentlessly. Now too cowardly to criticize Elder Griffin directly, he instead targeted Guan Yu. *Time to teach this pampered young master a lesson,* Guan Yu thought, narrowing his eyes dangerously.

Sensing Guan Yu's hostility, Lin Xi nervously cleared his throat. "If Guan Yu hadn't accepted Wang Chao's challenge over the Jade Stone Gate, today's chaos wouldn't have occurred! Anyone with sense knows Wang Shan's nature—he'd never surrender the Gate willingly!"

Before Guan Yu could respond, Lin Hui abruptly stood, his chair clattering to the floor with a thunderous boom. "Oh? So this is Guan Yu's fault now?" Lin Xi began nodding but froze under his father's murderous glare, sinking back into sullen silence.

"Enough, Hui! Sit!" Lin Mo's commanding voice echoed through the council hall. "This is no time for assigning blame!"

Lin Hui complied quietly, righting his chair.

"Elder Griffin entered closed-door cultivation last night and won't emerge for three months. Until then, we must avoid infighting and prepare thoroughly. Our priority is securing a Platinum Battle King—at any cost! Let us unite to overcome this crisis. Henceforth, monthly assemblies will convene. All elders and juniors must attend."

After dismissing the gathering, Lin Mo watched members file out until Guan Yu's voice halted them:

"Actually...we could cultivate our own Platinum Battle King."

Dead silence gripped the hall.

A single snicker erupted, triggering cascading laughter that soon erupted into uproarious mockery. Lin Mo's lips moved soundlessly, his words drowned by the din. When he finally roared "SILENCE!" with qi-infused authority, the crowd stilled, bewildered.

"Guan Yu, repeat your proposal."

Unfazed by the earlier ridicule, Guan Yu calmly restated: "Hiring a Platinum Battle King brings three risks: Wang remnants might survive to retaliate after their departure; an outsider's loyalty is questionable—they could betray us mid-battle; and as Uncle Lin Cai noted, their arrogance makes recruitment difficult. Cultivating our own ensures lasting benefits for the Lin Clan's future. The decision rests with you, Patriarch."

As Guan Yu pondered his recent breakthrough, Huo Lingling giggled nearby. "Some have all the luck—advancing in their sleep! How unfair!"

Ignoring her teasing, Guan Yu focused on the violet energy coalescing in his palm. *The speed and purity have improved drastically.* He unleashed it toward a distant boulder—

**BOOM!**

The massive stone exploded into shards. Stunned, Guan Yu gaped at the destruction. His intent had been merely to pierce it...

"Enough marveling," Lingling interjected. "We should return before Father scolds us!"

Realizing he'd slept through their outing while she kept watch, Guan Yu gestured apologetically. "Let me treat you to a feast—your pick!"

The pair feasted on street烤肉 and wine before parting at nightfall. Exhausted, Guan Yu collapsed onto his bed—

*Cough* "Smug over minor progress? You owe Lingling for this breakthrough."

Without opening his eyes, Guan Yu countered Bisquat Cat's apparition: "She merely stood guard."

"You underestimate her," the feline spirit tutted. "Your rival Lang Tianhua's training accelerates his growth—you can't afford complacency."

A sly smile crept across Guan Yu's face. "Surely you'll assist me? Remember our past...arrangements?"

Bisquat Cat's ears flattened. "Relying solely on external aids hinders true cultivation! Though..." It perked up. "That auction-house 'alchemist' was a fraud. With materials, I'll show you real pill-forging!"

The listed ingredients made Guan Yu blanch—prohibitively expensive.

"Lingling's your solution," Bisquat Cat purred. "Swallow your pride—survival trumps面子."

**Underworld Palace**

Within the obsidian throne room, Underworld King Akali Li's glacial gaze swept over trembling subjects. "Why remains she unfound?!"

A melodic voice spared them: "Li, I found an abandoned infant." The crowd exhaled as Queen Guan Yu entered, cradling a baby. "Let's adopt her as Windsong's sister."

Noticing his right Soul Pearl glowing near the child, Akali's eyes lit with hidden hunger. "A fitting gift for our daughter," he declared, placing the artifact in tiny hands.

Brilliant light erupted—the infant's consciousness stirred. *I'm alive?* Princess Guan Yu of Extinction Realm marveled. *Mother...I'll rescue you.*

Unseen, Akali's smile turned predatory.

Years later, young Guan Yu (now named Mingxue) played in gardens until her adoptive brother Ming Hansong chided: "Little Snow, destroying flowers again?"

"Brother!" She giggled, unaware of approaching shadows. That night, Akali abducted her to a desolate peak.

"Time to repay your upbringing," he hissed, greed unveiled.

Mingxue's blood ran cold.
