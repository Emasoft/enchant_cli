“Hannah, you’re here. Sister’s doing fine, really not sick. Don’t worry.” Ling’er forced a faint smile at Zhang Han, gently pinching the girl’s cheek. Surprisingly, Zhang Han didn’t protest.

Under normal circumstances, Zhang Han would have been furious. Though she often allowed Guanyu to pinch her cheeks out of her own willingness, anyone else in Qiaoyuan District—unless they washed their hands first—would never dare try such a thing.

Zhang Han had declared, “Your hands are covered in germs! Don’t touch my face, or the germs will spread and make me ugly. If I’m ugly, Big Brother won’t like me anymore.” Once, Lü Mei had teasingly asked why Guanyu didn’t need to wash his hands before pinching her.

With unwavering conviction, Zhang Han retorted, “Because if Big Brother gets germs on my face, he has to like me anyway—it’s his own fault!” Everyone found her logic irrefutable.

Zhang Han’s reasoning echoed again, met with the same amused acceptance.

Ling’er looked up, her eyes red-rimmed. “Guanyu, Jingjing… What brings you here?”

“We had some free time and thought to visit Aunt and Uncle,” Guanyu replied softly, his heart aching at Ling’er’s haggard appearance.

In the past, Aunt Qing’s face would light up with warmth whenever Guanyu visited. This time, however, her smile was absent. “Thank you for coming, Guanyu,” she said hurriedly, “but the main room isn’t fit for guests. Please join us in the west wing.”

“We don’t mind,” Xue Jing reassured, stepping forward. The west wing, cluttered with dust-covered belongings, was hastily cleaned by Ling’er with a damp cloth. “You walked all this way?” she asked, her voice trembling.

“Yes! It was so far!” Zhang Han chirped. “I got tired halfway, but Big Brother carried me. Sister Ling’er, I brought you a gift!” She handed over a wrapped sphere.

Ling’er unwrapped the package to reveal a glass orb filled with colorful paper stars and doves. “It’s old-fashioned,” Zhang Han admitted, “but it’s for luck and peace. I want your family to be safe and happy forever.”

Despite her childlike demeanor, Zhang Han’s thoughtfulness often surpassed adults’. Ling’er clutched the orb, tears welling as she whispered, “Safe and happy…”

Guanyu’s chest tightened. Uncle Qing’s condition must be dire.

“Don’t you like it?” Zhang Han asked, alarmed. “I’ll bring something else next time! Please don’t cry!”

Ling’er’s composure shattered. “No… I love it,” she choked out. “These are happy tears.”

The room dissolved into muffled sobs. Aunt Qing confessed, “He… he didn’t make it through the night.”

Guanyu’s heart sank. He’d arrived too late.

**Chapter 2359: A Peaceful Journey (Part 2)**

Ling’er recounted the horror: her father, ravaged by snake venom, had clawed at his flesh until dawn. “By morning… he was gone.”

Guanyu understood now why they’d been led to the west wing—the main room was a gruesome testament to Uncle Qing’s final hours.

As grief engulfed the household, Zhang Han’s wails drowned out others’. Xue Jing and Ling’er scrambled to soothe her.

Aunt Qing hesitated over burial plans. “I want to stay here with him,” she insisted, but Ling’er pleaded, “Let’s lay Father to rest in the city cemetery. You should live with me—I can’t leave you alone!”

Guanyu mediated: “Auntie, your presence in the city won’t burden Ling’er. It’ll ease her mind so she can thrive.”

After much persuasion, Aunt Qing relented. Guanyu arranged the funeral discreetly, mindful of Uncle Qing’s sensitive past.

Days later, Guanyu encountered Pan Xiaoxia near Pan Taisheng’s apartment. The teacher stood with a bespectacled man in a crisp suit.

“Long time no see!” Pan Xiaoxia teased. “Forgotten your old teacher?”

Xue Jing greeted her warmly, recalling school days.

As they chatted, Pan Xiaoxia mentioned newcomers moving in—Ling’er and her mother. Guanyu smiled, relieved they’d embraced this fresh start.

The group parted ways, carrying both sorrow and hope. In the quiet aftermath, Guanyu reflected on life’s impermanence—and the resilience blooming from shared grief.
