“Due to his fear that Bai Zhishi might suddenly attack him, Guan Yu secretly gathered elemental energy, prepared to respond to any unexpected danger.

To Guan Yu's surprise, after three seconds of mutual staring, Bai Zhishi suddenly burst into laughter and said, "Young master needn't be nervous. This humble one is Bai Xuelan. How may I address you?"

"Er...I'm Guan Yu, and this is Amy." Guan Yu's tension eased slightly, though he maintained vigilance. He knew this alluring woman before him couldn't be simple—a single misstep might land him in her trap.

Hearing the introduction, Bai Xuelan nodded with a smile before suddenly turning her gaze to the guard Guan Yu was choking. She scolded, "Why haven't you released Young Master Guan yet? Is this how we treat guests?"

Understanding her meaning, Guan Yu released the guard. The guard looked aggrieved—he'd been threatened and beaten, yet now received reprimands.

"Young Master Guan, Miss Amy, please follow me inside." Swaying her slender figure, Bai Xuelan led them into the Golden Auction House.

Watching her undulating hips from behind, Guan Yu felt an itch like wind blowing through his heart, saliva unknowingly dripping from his mouth.

Seeing his lecherous expression, Amy puffed her cheeks and secretly pinched his back.

Startled to awareness, Guan Yu straightened himself with an awkward laugh, thinking: *What's wrong with me? Has it been too long since I've had a woman? But she's truly tempting...*

Following Bai Xuelan through a long corridor into the main hall, she turned and asked, "Young Master Guan mentioned seeking Elder Shituo earlier?"

Guan Yu nodded. "Yes. Is he here now?"

"That...I can't answer yet. May I first ask why you seek him? And could you briefly introduce yourselves?"

Recognizing her wariness, Guan Yu mirrored her tone: "Since Miss Bai won't disclose information, I regret I cannot answer either."

Bai Xuelan paused, then laughed heartily. "How eloquent! Very well. Please wait here—help yourselves to fruits while I attend to matters."

As they sat down, Amy looked around and asked, "Dragon Brother, do you think we'll find Uncle Shituo?"

"How should I know? But since your father recommended this, it should work. Do you remember his appearance?"

Amy nodded. "I think so. Last saw him fifty years ago."

"Pfft—don't scare me!" Guan Yu spat out a fruit bite, face darkening.

Unperturbed, Amy retorted, "Don't forget—I'm over a hundred years old!"

"Fine, pretend I said nothing." Guan Yu remembered her elf heritage, shrugging helplessly.

"Who seeks me?"

A magnetic voice sounded as a tall, handsome man emerged.

"Uncle Shituo!" Amy leapt from her seat and dashed over.

The man blinked before smiling. "Ah! If it isn't my little sapling!"

Watching their reunion, Guan Yu felt awkward. Most shocking was that this dashing "uncle" was the legendary Shituo? He'd imagined beastfolk as burly, rough-looking brutes—this man defied all expectations except height.

"Ahem...Sir, are you Elder Shituo?"

Shituo turned, eyeing Guan Yu's 1.8m frame that seemed petite compared to his 2m stature.

"Uncle, this is Dragon Brother!" Amy chirped.

"Dragonkin?" Shituo's piercing re-examination made Guan Yu squirm.

"I'm Guan Yu, Amy's friend." Knowing his false dragonkin identity wouldn't fool experts, Guan Yu braced for exposure—yet Shituo remained silent.

"What brings you?"

Remembering Patriarch Allen's warning not to reveal his involvement, Guan Yu fabricated: "Trouble brews in Elvenwood...we need your aid."

"What could stump Allen?" Shituo's eyebrow arched.

Amy interjected: "The Life Source is poisoned! Only you can help!"

"Life Source?" Shituo's shock revealed his understanding of its importance to elves. "But how could I assist with elven matters?"

Guan Yu dropped the key detail: "The poison is gu."

"What?! Gu poison? You imply beastfolk sabotage elves?!" Rage colored Shituo's face.

"Don't misunderstand!" Guan Yu hurriedly explained. "Though gu-crafting is beastfolk expertise, other races could learn it. We suspect internal elven conspiracy—rebel factions already challenge Allen's leadership!"

"WHO DARES?!" Shituo's palm slammed the marble table, cracking it. Guan Yu marveled at the pure physical strength.

"Identifying culprits isn't urgent," Guan Yu pressed. "The Life Trees will wither without antidote!"

"Our priority? When did I agree to help?"

Guan Yu grimaced—Allen had warned of Shituo's mercurial nature. "If you won't go, who'll neutralize the poison?"

"Heh, not my concern." Shituo's demeanor flipped to nonchalance.

*Is he bipolar?* Guan Yu wondered, opting for reverse psychology. "Very well. We'll enjoy this luxurious auction house for two days before returning."

Shituo's eyes widened at the nonchalance. *Allen sent this irresponsible pup to beg my help?* Yet he maintained aloofness: "Stay if you wish. Our auctions offer rare pills, advanced techniques, divine artifacts—for those who can afford them."

As Shituo turned to leave, Guan Yu called: "Wait! Are all beastfolk this...handsome? You're nothing like I imagined!"

Shituo paused, then roared. His features shifted—jaw protruding, mane thickening, muscles swelling through torn clothes—transforming into a lion-headed behemoth.

"You mean this form?" His voice now gravelly.

Guan Yu gaped at the metamorphosis.

Reverting to human form, Shituo explained: "Only Grand Swordmasters can shapeshift."

"Grand Swordsman? Beastfolk cultivate like humans?"

"Such ignorance!" Shituo scoffed. "Long ago, humans and beastfolk were one race. Some evolved, others retained bestial traits. Though relations soured, our cultivation systems remain linked."

Guan Yu's mind flashed to Darwinian theory—apparently universal.

After Shituo departed, Guan Yu sighed: "Quite the character! Amy, was he always this eccentric?"

"Uncle's moods shift like spring weather. I play with him when cheerful, flee when angry."

"Let's hope he cooperates tomorrow..."

Chapter 1293: Who's Your Sister?

Dawn found Guan Yu awakening in a sunlit chamber reminiscent of presidential suites from his past life. Stretching luxuriously, he admired the gilded walls and sapphire chandeliers.

Pulling back curtains, he beheld gardens teeming with exotic flora and frolicking birds. "This is living! I should retire to such peace someday..."

Knocks interrupted his reverie. "Dragon Brother! Are you awake?"

Amy stood at the door in a white mini-dress and pink hat.

"Where'd you get those?"

"Snow Mistress gave them! She said the hat hides my ears so humans won't bully me." She twirled happily. "She said yesterday's headscarf was ugly."

Guan Yu winced. "Won't this hat make you favor her over me?"

Amy grinned impishly. "Keep dressing me prettily, and you'll stay my favorite!"

As they strolled through corridors, Amy's wide eyes caught everything. "Look! Those butterflies—are they married?"

"How should I know?" Guan Yu chuckled, the girl's innocent grip on his arm warming his heart.
