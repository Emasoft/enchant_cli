Without further ado, Santou floated up to the stone steps. He clearly remembered the cave entrance here was sealed by a magical barrier, requiring considerable effort to breach.

This seal primarily contained the chilling aura of the Ten-thousand-year Ice Lotus while repelling invaders.

Santou first retrieved the Ten-thousand-year Fire Gu. Previously stored in a jade-carved box, the fiery insect now rested in his palm.

Channeling spiritual power, Santou recalled encountering this barrier before. This time, he unleashed overwhelming force without restraint. With three to five strikes, the seal shattered.

As the barrier collapsed, Yanzhao standing in the courtyard center suddenly felt an arctic gust sweep over him. The bone-piercing cold surpassed anything he'd ever experienced.

Chapter 3931: The White-Haired Elder

Meanwhile, Hong Lianzi (Red Lotus Seed) was feasting and drinking with martial companions in the main hall when Yao Zong's jade pendant emitted crimson light. Frowning, Hong Lianzi never expected someone would dare cause trouble during his grand birthday celebration.

Yet with so many righteous sect members present—including Lu Shouzuo of the Azure Cloud Sect—he couldn't disrupt the festivities for internal matters.

Sun Lianzi (Lotus Seed) decided to dispatch reinforcements first. If they could repel the intruders, well and good. If not, he'd still have time to intervene personally.

After all, Sun Lianzi knew ordinary people couldn't endure the Ten-thousand-year Ice Lotus' cavern. Trespassers would either be frozen out within breaths or perish from the cold.

Sun Lianzi detached the glowing red token from his waist, handing it to a disciple. “Take this token, gather the Three-Elders, and lead all disciples there.”

“Yes, Master!” As the disciple acknowledged, a bloodied figure stumbled through the hall’s entrance, wailing, “Master! Disaster strikes! Save me!”

Yue Jing clutched his eye, crimson stains covering his body. He collapsed kneeling, weakened by blood loss.

The gruesome spectacle halted all feasting. Guests rose to witness the commotion.

Sun Lianzi’s face darkened seeing his prized disciple maimed. That someone dared disrupt his celebration before esteemed guests! Though minor issues shouldn’t trouble attendees, this demanded attention.

Examining Yue Jing’s wounds, Sun Lianzi found the arm injury manageable, but the eye seemed irreparable. Channeling healing energy into the disciple, he stabilized Yue Jing’s condition.

“Take him to recuperate. Don’t touch the eye. Fear not, child—your master will avenge this.”

After Yue Jing’s removal, Sun Lianzi addressed guests: “Apologies for interrupting your feast. Intruders breached our forbidden rear mountain and injured my disciple. This doesn’t concern you all—I’ll investigate briefly. Please continue dining.”

“Attend to your affairs, Sect Master Sun,” someone called. “We’re old friends here. If assistance is needed, simply ask.”

“No need for help. Crimson Lotus Sect can handle minor troubles. Your enjoyment here suffices as support.”

Meanwhile, Santou entered the Ice Lotus cavern. Even with the Fire Gu’s aid, the cold numbed his legs.

Last visit, he’d channeled full spiritual power yet nearly froze solid. Now the Fire Gu’s warmth proved crucial.

Holding the pulsating insect, Santou marveled at its heat radiating without his spiritual enhancement—clear proof of its potency.

Inside stretched a deep pit over ten meters down. Below lay the Ice Lotus, Wolf King, Myriad Phenomena Disk, and a Crimson Lotus elder guarding the artifact.

Though the Ice Lotus immobilized the Wolf King, the Myriad Phenomena Disk provided additional suppression. As a sect treasure attracting covetous eyes, an elder perpetually guarded it.

Originally dwelling in an external hut, this elder had retreated here after nearly succumbing to Qi deviation during cultivation. The freezing environment counteracted his internal fire—saving him from explosive combustion by cooling his raging blood and chaotic energy.

Now resembling an ice-encased specter, the elder’s decades-long seclusion left his current condition unknown.

Without hesitation, Santou leapt down. The Fire Gu buzzed excitedly in the extreme cold.

The cavern resembled an ice cellar. At its center rested a three-meter cubic ice block encasing a figure, above which hovered the rotating Myriad Phenomena Disk.

As Santou unfolded his palm, the Fire Gu writhed indignantly at the cold, its red glare intensifying. The ambient temperature perceptibly rose.

Clearly, the insect’s influence. Santou aimed to first retrieve the Disk, then melt the ice to rescue the Wolf King.

As he reached out, a voice echoed: “Youth, why pursue this folly? Leave now.”

Santou frowned. The speaker remained hidden, unlike last time when immediate attacks followed his approach.

Had decades of cultivation softened the elder? Mere warnings seemed out of character.

When no attack came, Santou lunged for the Disk, baiting the guardian out for Yanzhao to handle.

Whoosh! Santou dodged a rear assault. A white-haired, bearded figure materialized where he’d stood—face obscured by frozen tresses, pale-blue robes blending with the ice.

Emerging with lethal precision, the elder attacked again. Santou barely evaded, shocked by the speed.

‘This old monster’s decades of secluded cultivation bore fruit,’ Santou realized.

“Follow me if you dare!” Santou vaulted upward, exiting the cave.

The White-Haired Elder hesitated pursuing due to the Fire Gu’s threat. His chronic condition—raging blood and feverish body—made heat exposure deadly.

Outside, Yanzhao engaged the elder. Contact revealed the elder’s corpse-like chill, his icy limbs sapping Yanzhao’s warmth through each clash.

Santou reentered the cave, seizing the hovering Myriad Phenomena Disk. As he pocketed it, gale-force winds erupted. The intensified cold nearly cracked his skin until the Fire Gu flared brighter.

Below, the Wolf King’s ice prison split, dropping him into a crystalline coffin-like structure. Santou’s spells bounced uselessly off the reinforced ice.

The Fire Gu blazed defiantly against the cold. Santou hoped its heat could melt the Ice Lotus.

Detecting the disturbance, the White-Haired Elder abandoned Yanzhao, rushing back. Yanzhao couldn’t pursue—the cold would kill him.

Inside, the elder attacked Santou but avoided the Fire Gu’s radius. Though outmatched, Santou’s fiery advantage created stalemate.

“Return the Disk, and I’ll spare you!” the elder roared, realizing Santou’s true target was the Wolf King. “Without it, the Wolf King will freeze to death! Only the Disk can save him now!”

Hesitating, Santou produced the artifact. “Cease fighting. I’ll return it.”

As Santou approached the ice block, Yanzhao burst in shouting: “Retreat! Reinforcements approach!”

Yanzhao, shielded by spiritual energy, grabbed Santou’s shoulder and snatched the Disk. “Mission accomplished! Forget the Wolf King!”

Outside, Crimson Lotus disciples arrived. “Formation! Don’t let them escape!” Twenty disciples encircled Santou in sword array.

Though weaker in magic, Santou’s agility dodged relentless strikes while seeking the formation’s weakness.

Yanzhao struggled against the elder. “I’ll cover you! Flee now!” he roared, realizing their predicament.
