Guan Yu gently ran his right hand over the shoulder position of the armor, suddenly feeling an intense chill. How strange. Given the room's temperature, even iron shouldn't be this cold. Could this not be iron? Perhaps some kind of jade-like material? He pondered silently.

This armor was truly extraordinary. The attendant spoke again: "This armor must be a treasure. Otherwise, it wouldn't have made it to our display platform, don't you agree?"

"How much silver?" Guan Yu asked casually. He reasoned that regardless of its quality, money wasn't an issue. If necessary, he could always have Xuanming reimburse him later.

The armor did appear exceptionally unique, though its true value required closer inspection. Even if it turned out to be scrap metal, the mystery of materials used in the shoulder and chest sections intrigued him.

The attendant smiled knowingly. "The price is clearly marked. This armor not only carries historical significance but also bears a cost prohibitive to most. It's been featured in multiple auctions, yet remains unsold due to its exorbitant reserve price."

"Lack of buyers doesn't indicate poor quality," he continued. "In these peaceful times without major conflicts, few appreciate military armor. During wartime, this piece would be highly sought-after despite its bulk. But now? It would merely become decorative. Most aren't willing to spend fortunes on display pieces."

Guan Yu's attention shifted to an information plaque beside the armor. The listed price shocked him - five hundred taels of gold, an astronomical sum by any measure.

Calculating mentally, Guan Yu estimated this equaled roughly ten million Chinese yuan. The armor's value seemed inflated, perhaps relying solely on its historical provenance. Without its legendary battle record, it might not be worth fifty thousand taels.

Yet the unusual materials captivated him. The shoulder plates felt distinctly different - cold and unyielding. Resolving to investigate further post-purchase, Guan Yu checked his money pouch containing both gold leaves from Chief Lu and banknotes acquired at Blackblood Ridge.

"Wang Jun," he addressed his companion, "I'm considering buying this armor. Your thoughts?"

Wang Jun chuckled. "That's your decision. I'm just the pack mule here." Privately, he thought the price outrageous - five million in gold for what might be worthless scrap.

The attendant interjected: "Young master, please examine the craftsmanship and materials detailed here. Our top appraisers certified the construction - bear hide at joints for flexibility, ultra-dense black iron plating, and bear sinew linkages allowing mobility while protecting vital areas."

Most intriguing were the unidentified stone components at chest and shoulders. Testing revealed complete resistance to eighteen common weapons' attacks, though their exact nature remained undetermined.

"How long has this armor been here?" Guan Yu inquired.

"Over a year since my employment," the attendant replied. Guan Yu marveled that expert appraisers hadn't identified the mysterious stones, but recognized the limitations of ancient examination methods.

Wang Xiaorong voiced concern: "Isn't this too expensive?"

"Expensive perhaps," Guan Yu conceded, "but Master can reimburse me if needed." Producing two gold notes totaling six hundred thousand taels, he asked: "Are these acceptable?"

The attendant summoned Deputy Manager Fan Tong - a bearded, six-scarred monk incongruous in merchant's robes. After verifying the notes, Fan Tong processed the transaction, returning one hundred thousand taels in change.

As workers struggled with the three-hundred-pound armor, Fan Tong offered VIP access to an imminent auction. "Any customer spending five hundred gold taels becomes our honored guest," he explained, presenting silver admission tokens.

Wang Jun eyed the token skeptically. "Can these be resold?"

"Officially no," Fan Tong grinned, "but we might repurchase them at two hundred thousand silver taels each." His tone suggested flexible ethics beneath monastic robes.

Guan Yu accepted the tokens, mentally noting the armor's enigmatic stones awaiting analysis. The chill beneath his fingers promised secrets worth far more than gold.
