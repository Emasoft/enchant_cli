The deafening noise startled Guan Yu awake, prompting him to immediately investigate. Strangely, Jiang Yuan Kai’s quarters showed no signs of disturbance. “Could they have slept through this?” he wondered, puzzled by the silence from Jiang’s camp.

“I don’t know either,” Wang Xiaorong said anxiously. “After being woken by the commotion, I saw her covering her face and running back here in tears.” Qiqi looked equally troubled. Just as Guan Yu prepared to ask more questions, Jiang Yuan Kai entered with an apologetic expression.

Standing respectfully at the doorway of the women’s quarters, Jiang addressed Duan Ruxue: “Miss Duan, I deeply regret my reflexive action. Though unintentional, I offer my sincere apologies for striking you.”

Guan Yu turned to him. “Brother Jiang, what exactly happened?”

Jiang sighed heavily. “In my drowsy state, I sensed someone nearby and instinctively threw a punch. Only later did I realize it was Miss Duan. I never imagined she would enter my chambers.”

“She went to your room?” Guan Yu’s voice rose in surprise, laden with unspoken implications. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi exchanged meaningful glances as Jiang continued, touching the vivid palm print on his cheek: “When I tried to help her up after the accident, she... retaliated.”

Though amused by the absurdity of this drama amidst their perilous circumstances, Guan Yu maintained composure. Duan Ruxue’s motives perplexed him. Had she sought the East Sea Dragon Pearl? Attempted seduction? The truth remained veiled behind her tear-swollen face.

“It’s all your fault!” Duan Ruxue suddenly wailed, lowering her hands to reveal a grotesquely swollen left eye—a perfect panda-eye bruise. Qiqi burst into laughter before being silenced by glares.

Through hiccuping sobs, Duan explained: “I... I wanted to find you at dawn for a walk! I thought you were in the room to my right! How was I to know you’d switched quarters with Brother Jiang?”

Jiang bowed deeply. “The fault is mine for reacting so harshly, Miss Duan.”

“Enough,” Guan Yu intervened, examining the injury. “Let me treat this. Spiritual energy and acupuncture can reduce the swelling.” Ignoring Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi’s jealous protests, he dismissed the crowd.

Alone with Duan Ruxue, Guan Yu applied warm compresses while sterilizing silver needles. “Press firmly here,” he instructed. “This will hurt briefly before the numbness sets in.”

“Will... will I go blind?” she sniffled pathetically.

“Nonsense. By tomorrow, you’ll be glaring daggers at me again.” His gentle teasing eased her tension as healing energy flowed through the needles. Outside, the camp stirred with breakfast preparations, unaware of the morning’s melodrama fading into legend.
