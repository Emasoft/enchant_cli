“Don’t act recklessly…” Yuan Shanding said coldly. “Don’t cause trouble now, understand? I think this place is quite good. The rooms aren’t small either—having four people share one is acceptable. Everyone should go rest in their rooms and keep their mouths shut.”

Only Jiu Biyun knew Yuan Shanding’s true purpose for coming here. The subordinates he brought along remained unaware. When leaving the Feng Family earlier, Yuan Shanding had only told his men they were embarking on a mission. He planned to reveal their real objective when the time came to act, fearing loose tongues might alert their targets.

The young monk added, “Since there are many of you, a few should follow me to collect your luggage.”

Seizing the chance to scout the area, Yuan Shanding quickly said, “The rest of you stay put. You and you—come with me.” He led two subordinates behind the young monk to the far left side of Houyuan Temple, where an antiquated large building stood. Upon opening the door, they found it filled with daily necessities—bedding, brooms, shovels, and other household tools. Clearly a storage room.

“Take two sets each. Combined with what’s already in your rooms, that should suffice,” the young monk gestured toward stacks of bedding with faded green covers. Yuan Shanding remained silent, complying without complaint. Securing lodging here marked the first step of his plan—now was not the time for objections.

After retrieving the luggage, the young monk returned to the main hall. “Master, they’re settled, though they seemed displeased.”

“What did they say?” Shen Sheng asked.

“One complained about empty rooms being available but was silenced by their leader,” the monk reported truthfully.

Shen Sheng nodded. “Let them approach me directly if they have further demands.” As the young monk withdrew, Xiao Bai remarked, “How peculiar—it’s rare to host such a large group all at once.”

“They’re undoubtedly outsiders,” Shen Sheng observed. “Their accents sound genuine, their attire rustic. But one thing’s certain—they’re people of the jianghu.”

Big Beard boomed, “Why fuss? They’re just lodgers, not temple-wreckers! They’ll likely leave in a few days. What’s it to us?”

Shen Sheng shook his head. While Big Beard’s logic held, the leader’s shifty eyes during their exchange suggested hidden motives. In earlier times, he wouldn’t have cared—their mountain hermitage stayed above worldly affairs. But since meeting Guan Yu and making enemies, caution had become necessary.

“Xiao Bai,” Shen Sheng decided, “keep watch over them. That leader is concealing something.”

Though thinking it excessive, Xiao Bai agreed. Nearby, Big Beard erupted in laughter over their chessboard: “My knight’s move seals your fate! Checkmate!”

Shen Sheng shot him an exasperated look. Big Beard and You Guang’s chess skills were evenly matched, but recently You Guang’s new strategies had dominated—until today’s upset victory. “Let him win occasionally,” Shen Sheng advised You Guang. “Else he’ll pester you endlessly.”

“Don’t dampen our fun!” Big Beard retorted. “You non-players can’t grasp this pleasure. We’d rather teach Shigu martial arts? He’s your disciple—you train him!”

Their banter was interrupted as the young monk Shigu (Lost Care) rushed in breathlessly: “Master! Those guests demand food! When I said we only provide lodging, they threatened to demolish the temple!”

Before Shen Sheng could respond, Big Beard roared, “The gall! Tell them to cook their own meals or get out!”

Shen Sheng rose. “I’ll handle this.” He followed Shigu to the main hall where Yuan Shanding knelt before a bronze Buddha statue, his men muttering behind him.

“Venerable Master,” Yuan Shanding stood, “we’ve traveled far and hunger grows. As noon approaches, shouldn’t meals be provided?”

“We offer free lodging only,” Shen Sheng replied calmly, studying the man’s decent cultivation level. “You may purchase food downhill, but bring no meat or alcohol here.”

“Downhill? That’s miles away!” Yuan Shanding protested. “Just share your provisions—we’ll pay!”

Shigu interjected, “Quit wasting time! We’ve told you—no meals!”

“Brat!” Yuan Shanding snarled, lunging at Shigu’s collar. Shen Sheng intercepted his wrist mid-air. “The child misspoke, but violence isn’t necessary.”

A brief struggle ensued before Shen Sheng pushed Yuan Shanding back effortlessly. Recognizing the monk’s superior skill, Yuan Shanding signaled Jiu Biyun. She attacked immediately, her palm striking downward with lethal force. Shen Sheng dodged, maneuvering away from Shigu.

“A woman?” Shen Sheng realized, parrying her rapid blows. Her cultivation astonished him—this opponent was formidable.
