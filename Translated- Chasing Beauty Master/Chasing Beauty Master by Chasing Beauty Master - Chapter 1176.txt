“Such a family, in the eyes of ordinary people, would be considered wealthy. But Xue Jing said this relative of hers truly had no money at all.

Chapter 3013: An Unusual Tone of Speech

The relative’s household had an older brother who spent his days driving around in a modest 200,000-yuan car, yet couldn’t even afford gas during critical moments.

Guanyu remembered Xue Jing mentioning how this brother once lacked the 2,000 yuan to pay a traffic fine and had to call her to borrow money.

Such families maintained a facade of prosperity, living superficially while drowning in debt. In reality, they fared worse than ordinary commoners.

Lin Qiaoqiao (Skillful and Clever) said, “Turn left at the corner ahead—that’s my home.” Guanyu nodded, thinking that the Lin family, renowned in the martial world, surely wouldn’t have a modest entrance.

Regardless of wealth, maintaining the Lin family’s prestige alone would demand an impressive front.

Indeed, at the street’s end, Guanyu glanced left and saw a grand gateway ahead. A colorful arched gate adorned with a large plaque stood prominently.

The wooden plaque, weathered by years of sun and wind, bore golden characters reading “Lin Residence.”

Lin Qiaoqiao pointed excitedly. “Look, that’s my home! Let’s hurry. Mom and Dad must be anxious—we haven’t returned in ages. The house will be lively today!”

She quickened her pace as Guanyu remarked, “Wow, your home looks magnificent. Your family must be formidable.”

Lin Qiaoqiao lifted her chin proudly. “Of course! Our Lin family is renowned in Huzhou Town. Though our martial legacy has declined, people still respect us for our influence and wealth.”

“Since your family’s martial arts have faded, you’ve shifted to commerce, right?” Guanyu inferred this from Lin Zhonggeng’s (Forest Middle Prosperity) business-like demeanor.

Lin Qiaoqiao nodded. “Exactly. Father’s ventures thrive in big cities, but here, many matters still require force. That’s why we expanded elsewhere. Even so, the Lin name commands respect here.”

Guanyu didn’t doubt this. Without such prestige, Lin Zhonggeng wouldn’t arrange a martial arts tournament to choose a husband for his daughter—an event beyond the means of ordinary families.

The street widened near the Lin estate. Beside the main gate stood a large wooden platform, reminiscent of ancient opera stages—clearly the tournament arena.

The Lin residence’s gates stood open, revealing a brightly lit courtyard buzzing with voices. A crowd had gathered.

Lin Qiaoqiao looped her arm through Guanyu’s, which he didn’t resist. Though pretending to be her boyfriend, he saw no harm in playing the part.

“Let’s go in. I’ll introduce you to my relatives,” she said, pulling him forward.

The courtyard, though smaller than the Yang family’s estate, mirrored traditional Chinese architecture with towering trees and flower gardens. Buildings stood closer, creating a bustling atmosphere.

A massive pavilion-like structure faced the gate, illuminated and filled with chatting guests. As they approached, a young man spotted Lin Qiaoqiao and exclaimed, “Qiaoqiao’s back!”

The man’s joy radiated like reunion after long separation. Lin Qiaoqiao waved and called, “Brother Li Gui (Rail Track)! It’s been forever! Did you miss me?”

Their rapport seemed warm. Li Gui rushed over, complaining, “Qiaoqiao, why so late? I’ve missed you terribly!”

His shout drew a crowd—men, women, elders, and two toddlers who chirped, “Sister Qiaoqiao! We missed you!”

Lin Qiaoqiao beamed, handing the children toys from Guanyu’s bags. “Thank you!” they giggled, scampering off.

Guanyu realized the Lin family’s extensive relations would be challenging. Li Gui’s smile vanished upon noticing Guanyu, his expression turning hostile.

Seeing Lin Qiaoqiao clinging to Guanyu, Li Gui darkened further. Coldly, he demanded, “Qiaoqiao, who is this?”

Guanyu immediately disliked Li Gui’s hypocritical demeanor, reminiscent of a certain sect leader from a TV drama. Internally, he scoffed: *Damn it, we’ve never met. Why glare like I wronged your mother?*

But Guanyu remained composed. His task was to impersonate Lin Qiaoqiao’s lover—and antagonize this rival. Deliberately tightening his arm around her, he smirked arrogantly.

Li Gui gritted his teeth. “Qiaoqiao, this man reeks of trouble. Why associate with him?”

Chapter 3014: Everyone’s Waiting

Before Lin Qiaoqiao could respond, Guanyu interjected, “Mind your tone, young man. Whatever your agenda, remember: loose tongues cause more harm than loose diets. Whether I’m ‘good’ or not isn’t your concern.”

Guanyu recognized Li Gui’s infatuation. The man saw every male near Lin Qiaoqiao as a threat—hence the baseless accusation. Yet he couldn’t fathom she’d sought Guanyu willingly.

Clearly, Li Gui’s affection was one-sided. Lin Qiaoqiao, though outwardly fierce, fiercely protected those she cherished. She snapped, “Brother Li Gui, stop this! He’s my dearest friend, invited here by me.”

Li Gui had hoped to diminish Guanyu using their long acquaintance, but Lin Qiaoqiao’s defense stunned him. Enraged, he spat, “Qiaoqiao, don’t be fooled by appearances! Beware such men!”

Guanyu inwardly mocked: *‘Don’t judge by appearances’? More like envy because I’m handsomer!* Li Gui’s average looks and shorter stature paled beside Guanyu’s striking presence.

Lin Qiaoqiao insisted, “What’s wrong with you today? Why attack him? Guanyu’s wonderful—stop this!”

Guanyu stayed silent, letting her words wound Li Gui deeper. As tensions rose, Lin Zhonggeng called, “Qiaoqiao! Come inside—everyone’s waiting!”

“Coming!” She tugged Guanyu forward. All eyes turned to him, but he remained unfazed—accustomed to scrutiny.

Lin Qiaoqiao announced, “Everyone, this is Guanyu, my… close friend.” She nearly said “boyfriend” but hesitated, mindful of tomorrow’s tournament.

She introduced relatives: “This is Second Aunt, Uncle…” Guanyu greeted each politely. The crowd included neighbors and Lin Zhonggeng’s friends.

Noticing a middle-aged man resembling Li Gui, Guanyu guessed he was Li Gui’s father. *Like father, like son—both rotten,* he thought.

After introductions, Li Gui sneered, “Qiaoqiao, bringing a ‘friend’ on the eve of your tournament seems improper.”

Lin Zhonggeng sensed Li Gui’s jealousy but held his tongue. Privately, he regretted arranging the tournament, fearing it might ruin his daughter’s happiness.

Lin Qiaoqiao declared, “Guanyu admires me and has pursued me persistently. Since the tournament offers opportunities, he deserves a chance too.” She discreetly pulled Guanyu’s sleeve, signaling compliance.

Li Gui vowed, “I’ll win tomorrow’s tournament, Qiaoqiao! Victory will be mine!”

His father added, “My son and Qiaoqiao grew up together—childhood sweethearts! He’s trained tirelessly for this day!”

Lin Zhonggeng forced a smile, glancing at Guanyu. He and his wife desperately hoped Guanyu would prevail, having learned of his affluent background and admirable traits during their time in City A.

Originally, they’d believed Guanyu and Qiaoqiao had split due to his absence, prompting the tournament. Now, Lin Zhonggeng bitterly regretted the decision. Canceling would save face, but it was too late.

Lin Qiaoqiao didn’t blame her father. Their faux relationship and his pragmatic motives made the tournament unavoidable. She’d initially trusted Guanyu’s prowess to crush competitors—never anticipating his lost cultivation.

Worried, she glanced at Guanyu, her pleading eyes confirming her disdain for Li Gui.

Li Gui pressed, “Qiaoqiao and I share unbreakable bonds! No outsider can come between us!”

His father nodded approvingly. Guanyu seethed at their two-faced act.

Lin Zhonggeng remained silent. Though Li Gui seemed decent, his daughter’s happiness outweighed all. The Li family’s previous marriage proposals had been rejected, driving Lin Qiaoqiao to briefly run away—traumatizing her parents.

Chapter 3015: The Best Choice

The gathering highlighted Lin Qiaoqiao’s dilemma. Tomorrow’s tournament would decide her fate. Guanyu, now powerless, faced uncertain odds. Yet Lin Qiaoqiao’s heart clung to hope—and him.

As the Li父子’s theatrics continued, Lin Zhonggeng silently prayed Guanyu would defy expectations. For his daughter’s sake, and the Lin family’s future, Guanyu remained their best—and only—choice.
