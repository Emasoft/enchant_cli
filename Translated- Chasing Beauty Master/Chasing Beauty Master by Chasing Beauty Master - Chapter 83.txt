Observing Niu Le’s vigilant posture, ever ready to shield him, Guan Yu felt a surge of warmth in his heart. *This big lummox is truly a man of loyalty and deep sentiment!*

As Li Yuanshan and the opposing side stood locked in tension, Li Yuanshan’s phone rang.

“Tiger… at 63 West Street. Come!” With that, Li Yuanshan casually ended the call and raised an eyebrow, calmly eyeing the group before him.

Noting Li Yuanshan’s unflappable demeanor, the man known as Boss Guo narrowed his eyes, sensing something amiss. After all, as a gang leader who dominated these streets, his instincts were sharp. He knew Li Yuanshan was one of the few jade tycoons in the country—a man who could crush his small gang with wealth alone. Provoking him would be folly.

Before Boss Guo could find an exit strategy, a disciplined column of black-suited men marched swiftly around the corner, their faces stern and aura menacing.

“Boss Guo… any room for negotiation?” Li Yuanshan asked softly, though a flicker of ruthlessness glinted in his eyes.

Boss Guo lit a cigarette and forced a smile. “Others’ words might mean nothing here, but since you’ve spoken, Li, I’ll spare the boy this once. As for compensation… cover the medical bills and soothe my men’s tempers. That’ll do.” As he spoke, the black-suited men halted before Li Yuanshan.

“Brother Li, all good?” A burly man with a buzz cut stepped forward, voice low.

“A minor misunderstanding. Boss Guo’s been gracious,” Li Yuanshan replied, glancing pointedly at Boss Guo.

Without hesitation, Li Yuanshan pulled out a checkbook, scribbled a sum of one million, and handed it over.

“Brother, let me cover this—” Guan Yu interjected.

“Trivial. That jade you sold me saved me over ten million. This is nothing.” Li Yuanshan waved dismissively. “With my men here, no one will trouble you. Let’s go.” He gestured toward the parking lot, ignoring Boss Guo entirely.

True to Li Yuanshan’s word, once Tiger and his men arrived, the lurking threats vanished. Li Yuanshan’s reputation as a top jade magnate deterred even the boldest.

“Tonight, I’ll host a proper gathering. You’ve got spirit, Brother Guan—giving up over ten million so easily!” Li Yuanshan chuckled in the car.

“Straightforward folks prefer straightforward dealings. That woman reeked of cunning,” Guan Yu shrugged, omitting his true motive for selling to Li Yuanshan.

Tiger, the driver, stole puzzled glances at Guan Yu through the rearview mirror. *How does a kid Brother Li’s daughter’s age earn such respect?*

“Brother Li, the other jade company CEOs are here. Should we meet them?”

“Later. Tonight is for drinks with Brother Guan!” Li Yuanshan declared, slapping his thigh.

Through conversation, Guan Yu learned Li Yuanshan’s next venture: leading a team of partners and stone-gambling experts to Myanmar’s Mu Na old mines for newly unearthed rough jade.

“Gambling on stones there…” Guan Yu mused, unimpressed. With tens of millions now, money hardly concerned him.

“Ever dabbled in stone gambling before?” Li Yuanshan probed.

“Pure luck today. Without you, I might’ve tossed that jade aside!” Guan Yu deflected, flattering Li Yuanshan.

Li Yuanshan laughed heartily, recognizing the compliment yet sensing deeper currents.

Their car soon halted at a five-star hotel. Before Guan Yu could exit, six middle-aged men rushed to open doors, only to freeze upon seeing the youth emerge.

Ignoring Guan Yu and Niu Le’s nods, the men flocked to Li Yuanshan.

Excluded, Guan Yu and Niu Le exchanged wry glances.

“Brother Guan, join us!” Li Yuanshan beckoned warmly.

Inside, the group discussed Li Yuanshan’s haul. When Tiger presented the premium jade, the businessmen gasped, their earlier indifference melting into eager camaraderie.

Seated beside Li Yuanshan at the lavish banquet, Guan Yu weathered a barrage of toasts. Normally a lightweight, he discovered his healing ability could purge intoxication—turning him into an unstoppable drinker.

“Brother, any travel constraints?” Li Yuanshan asked later.

“Two weeks free,” Guan Yu replied.

“Join me in Myanmar! I’ll handle the paperwork.”

Guan Yu hesitated. “No passport…”

“Done in days! I’m desperate—my shops need quality jade. Help me, and I’ll pay top prices!”

Guan Yu demurred, citing luck, but Li Yuanshan insisted. *Another chance at billions?* Guan Yu agreed.

A portly man interjected, “I’ve brought Professor Lin, a jade appraisal expert! His device detects raw stones with 70% accuracy!”

Li Yuanshan’s interest piqued. “Revolutionary!”

Professor Lin, unassuming yet confident, produced calibrated rulers from his bag. As Li Yuanshan leaned in, Guan Yu watched, calculating risks and rewards.
