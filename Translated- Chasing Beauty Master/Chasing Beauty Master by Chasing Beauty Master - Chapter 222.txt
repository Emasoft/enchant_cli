However, Guan Yu found the term "grandson-in-law" rather awkward. While he was willing to take on this role, it ultimately depended on Feng Xin's acceptance.

When Feng Xin heard the old man had already confirmed Guan Yu's status as her betrothed, a blush crept up her cheeks. She shot the old patriarch a reproachful glance. "I'll handle matters," she said, "but Guan Yu suspects there's more complexity to this situation."

"Oh?" The old man turned to Guan Yu with a questioning look.

**Chapter 552: Purge of Forces (Part 2)**

Old Master Feng had initially assumed Guan Yu's assassination attempt stemmed from recent prominence stirring envy among rivals. But Feng Xin's words now hinted at deeper currents.

"Explain," the patriarch demanded.

Setting down his chopsticks, Guan Yu adopted a grave tone. "The faction targeting me is an obscure N City group led by Qian Tong. Someone's pulling his strings—directing him to kill me."

"Manipulated from the shadows?" The old man frowned. "By whom?"

Guan Yu raised a thumb in admiration. "Grandfather's insight is peerless. Indeed, there's a puppeteer behind this."

"Name them!" The patriarch's voice boomed with authority, anger simmering beneath his words.

"Wan Qianshan."

"Taiwan's Wan Qianshan?" The old man's eyebrows arched.

Guan Yu nodded confirmation.

"What vendetta could you possibly have with him?" The patriarch frowned. "N City lies thousands of miles from Taiwan. How did you two become entangled in this death feud?"

"No profound enmity—merely minor clashes." Guan Yu recounted the incident in the private lounge.

Upon hearing the tale, the old man slammed his palm on the marble table, rattling the dishes. "An insignificant upstart daring such arrogance in N City! Though I can't reach him in Taiwan, should he ever set foot here, I'll make him regret breathing!"

Guan Yu nodded vigorously. "Grandfather speaks wisdom. When you were forging your legacy, that wretch was still in swaddling clothes. Such vermin aren't worth your fury."

"But why would a Taiwan-based magnate need a petty pawn here?" The patriarch's anger nearly obscured this crucial question.

Guan Yu shook his head. "He's planted multiple chess pieces in N City—not just one."

The old man's eyes narrowed, sensing impending stormclouds. "A conspiracy?"

He didn't question Guan Yu's certainty. Though impulsive like most youth, the young man possessed measured judgment. If he raised this alarm, the threat was real.

"A conspiracy indeed," Guan Yu admitted. "But while we know he's placed agents here, their purpose remains unclear. My investigations hit dead ends."

His reconnaissance system never failed—Qian Tong truly knew nothing. Now his hopes rested on other pawns yielding clues. Strangely, unease gnawed at Guan Yu since uncovering Wan's scheme.

"So you've identified his other agents?" The patriarch deduced.

"From Qian Tong's testimony: Chen Biao, Wang Dahu, Yang Long, Zhou Jin, and Chu Hong."

The old man knitted his brows. "Can his words be trusted?"

Though unfamiliar with Qian Tong, he knew dying men's words often turned venomous—especially in their world where loyalty meant little. The memory of Master Xu's betrayal still rankled.

"In those circumstances... likely truthful." Guan Yu glanced at Feng Xin.

He knew with absolute certainty—Qian Tong hadn't lied. Or rather, hadn't spoken at all. Unless the man anticipated Guan Yu's mind-reading ability and planted false leads—an impossibility when Guan Yu's powers remained secret.

Understanding his look, Feng Xin interjected: "Guan Yu's interrogation methods are reliable."

The old man remained puzzled, but Guan Yu flushed at her implication. Circumstances forced virtuous men to harsh measures.

"Your plan?" The patriarch asked. Coming for this meal, Guan Yu must have strategies prepared.

"Weeds burned not to the root will sprout again with the spring breeze," Guan Yu quoted solemnly. "Wan's pawns here mean ill. We must eradicate them completely."

"Considered the consequences?" The patriarch countered.

"Consequences? You mean the power vacuum between the three families?"

The old man shook his head. "For our triad, resource distribution isn't the main concern. The true danger lies in the upheaval from removing these factions."

"But aren't these minor groups? Doesn't N City's underworld need periodic renewal?" Guan Yu frowned.

Feng Xin answered instead: "You misunderstand. Among those five, three hold real influence—Yang Long, Zhou Jin, and Chu Hong."

She detailed their backgrounds: Yang Long's ruthless ascent over his boss's corpse; Zhou Jin's cunning rise from protection rackets, earning the moniker "Strategist"; Chu Hong, the beautiful socialite leveraging her charms to build formidable connections.

"Chu Hong's particularly dangerous for you," Feng Xin concluded.

"Why?"

"Because you're a man—a lustful man." Her tone held glacial calm.

**Chapter 553: Purge of Forces (Part 3)**

Were the patriarch absent, Guan Yu might have swatted Feng Xin's backside for this slander. Did she truly view him so basely?

He coughed awkwardly. "So these can't be touched?"

"Not impossible, but costly—a Pyrrhic victory."

"What if we ally with the other families?"

Feng Xin's disdain deepened. "Even united, the aftermath matters. Eliminating established factions could panic smaller groups into uniting against us. Numbers might overwhelm our foundations."

Guan Yu hadn't considered these ripples. The complexity daunted him.

"Yet leaving Wan's time bombs here endangers everyone," he argued.

Feng Xin agreed. "Wan's schemes run deeper than imagined. His endgame remains unclear."

As both pondered gloomily, the patriarch suddenly laughed heartily.

"Grandfather! How can you laugh when bombs litter our courtyard?" Feng Xin protested.

"Worry solves nothing," the old man chuckled. "Daughter, your concern for Guan Yu clouds judgment."

Blushing furiously, Feng Xin stamped her foot. "This isn't about him! Wan's plotting against N City's underworld!"

Her accidental accuracy went unacknowledged as the patriarch continued laughing.

When mirth subsided, he grew serious. "We must act on what we know. If the major players can't be moved..."

"Target the smaller ones," Guan Yu realized.

The old man nodded. "Let your faction handle them. Your power's stagnant—this expansion serves dual purposes."

Guan Yu grasped the strategy—using his group's growth to mask the purge.

"But won't this alert Wan?"

Feng Xin interjected sarcastically: "Take more factions simultaneously. Camouflage the true targets."

Her barb held wisdom. Guan Yu's overreliance on his powers had dulled basic tactics.

The patriarch approved. "Remember, boy—true leadership uses brains, not just blades. Every veteran reeks of past sins..."

"Grandfather!" Feng Xin objected.

"...except my pure granddaughter here. Any man wed to her would be blessed. Don't you agree, Guan Yu?"

"Y-yes..."

"Will you marry her then?"

"I will."

The patriarch's triumphant grin widened.

**Chapter 554: Purge of Forces (Part 4)**

In the departing car, Guan Yu exhaled deeply.

As N City's most low-profile and negligent crime boss, he'd delegated everything to lieutenant Luo Cheng—unaware of his own empire's size or income. Never had a figurehead been so detached.

The patriarch's guidance illuminated his path, but during strategic discussions, Guan Yu walked blindly into marital entrapment. Before he could protest, the old man began planning parental meetings—a prospect terrifying for Guan Yu's simple father facing this cunning fox.

Retreat became the only option. Feng Xin fled too, mortified by her grandfather's desperation to wed her off.

Yet amidst her anger lay anticipation.

"Guan Yu," she ventured hesitantly during their drive.

"Yes, sister?"

"That... what you promised Grandfather..."

"Promised?"

Her cheeks flushed. "About... bringing your father here. Was that real?"

Guan Yu froze. Caught between political machinations and budding romance, the underworld's complexities suddenly paled against this new battlefield of the heart.
