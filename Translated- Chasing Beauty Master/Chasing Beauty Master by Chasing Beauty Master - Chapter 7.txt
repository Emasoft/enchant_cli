This… Guan Yu pinched his chin, hesitating for a long while before shaking his head helplessly. His consciousness simply couldn't synchronize with the operation of this ashtray—after all, this required extremely strong and precise judgment!

Unless… the ashtray remained constantly in his hand!

But… a new problem arose! Guan Yu swallowed hard, hefting the ashtray in his palm. If he used it as a weapon, while increased gravity could grant him enhanced effects… the strength he'd need to exert would double. It was like the difference between wielding a wooden stick and an iron rod—ultimately, the decisive factor in striking an opponent still depended on the strength and speed of his swing…

His eyes darted rapidly as inspiration suddenly flashed through Guan Yu's mind. With intense seriousness, he fell into deep contemplation…

Exploring, endlessly hypothesizing, Guan Yu felt himself inching closer to the truth. If… if he could truly grasp the core of this problem, perhaps… all issues would resolve themselves!

Gravity system… Guan Yu pressed his lips together.

Ten minutes later, after throwing several experimental punches, Guan Yu's fist suddenly cut through the air with a sharp *whoosh* at the peak of its extension. His body staggered from the momentum, nearly losing balance.

Yes! Clenching his fist tightly, Guan Yu gritted his teeth in excitement. He'd finally found the right method! Just from the wind displacement and sonic boom of this punch, he could tell—imagine the impact if this struck someone's face or gut!

The secret lay in issuing a gravity-reduction command at the instant of throwing a punch. As the fist surged forward with inertial speed, he'd abruptly increase gravity at the critical moment. The drastic contrast between lightness and heaviness created blinding speed followed by devastating force—a perfect combination!

Yet Guan Yu knew real combat wouldn't allow such smooth execution. Opponents neither stood still nor granted time for constant mental commands. Still, an unexpected strike like this could achieve miraculous results! With determined resolve, he grinned fiercely. Through relentless practice, this gravity manipulation would become his greatest weapon.

Tiger gaining wings—truly! His natural strength already surpassed ordinary people—he could lift a person by the neck single-handedly. Paired with gravity control? He'd wield objects like juggling props!

Growing more exhilarated, Guan Yu nearly vibrated with the urge to test this ability on someone immediately.

After calming himself gradually, the reality of his situation struck. This wasn't some TV drama or novel—he'd actually stumbled upon supernatural powers in real life!

With this ability, he could carry double corn sacks at the docks, doubling his daily earnings… Wait. Guan Yu scratched his head, frowning. Something felt off…

After a long pause, he smacked his forehead in self-mockery. What foolishness! With healing powers, he could become a doctor charging fees… but without credentials or reputation, who'd trust him?

As for the gravity system—could he dominate sports events for prize money?

The more he pondered, the brighter his future seemed. That bronze coin had transformed his world, unveiling endless possibilities.

Half an hour later, checking his mental interface, Guan Yu jolted in surprise. The healing ability had cooled down, but the gravity system now glowed gray.

Continuous gravity shifts lasted thirty minutes maximum, while healing only stored one charge at 20% efficacy. He memorized these limitations—mastery required thorough understanding.

Yet mysteries remained. What energy powered these systems? Cars needed fuel, trains electricity… did his abilities consume nothing?

After fruitless speculation, Guan Yu abandoned the puzzle. He'd solve it when the time came.

**Chapter Sixteen: For Love**

Lying in bed beneath bright streetlights, Guan Yu marveled at the vibrant city night. Despite self-warnings, exhilaration overwhelmed him. How could he sleep after gaining such game-cheat powers? What if they vanished by morning?

Sitting up, he lit a cheap cigarette. Past 10 PM, laughter still drifted from the nearby university campus—his home for the next four years.

Most students here chased artistic dreams: broadcasting, music, instruments. Yet Guan Yu had blindly chosen stage performance under Liu Shilei's tutelage, clueless about its prospects.

When asked why attend college, he'd solemnly declared: "To find true love." He'd followed his high school crush here—the campus belle who once gravitated toward his gang.

But family circumstances barred their path. His widowed father, a struggling laborer, scraped savings for tuition. Though running with street crews, Guan Yu rarely asked for money, earning "miser" taunts.

Even chasing her to university yielded only the sight of her entering another man's car, leaving him choking on exhaust fumes.

"Let's just be friends… We're incompatible." The memory drew a bitter smile.

Now, with supernatural gifts, Guan Yu anticipated campus life anew. Art schools overflowed with beauties—finding love shouldn't be hard. As for Fu Linlin… He crushed his cigarette savagely. She'd regret choosing wealth over him.

Yet reality intruded. His flip phone, topped with fifty yuan credit, got swindled by a sweet-faced girl. Unbelievable!

Agitated, he shuffled to the window. The campus sprawled beneath moonlight—fountains, tidy paths, lush trees brimming with youthful vitality.

Suddenly, movement caught his eye. A dozen white-shirted figures marched through the gates. Among them, a bandaged limping figure supported by two others.

Recognition struck—the teacher he'd beaten hours earlier! Were they seeking revenge? Liu Shilei and Mo Ling, vulnerable women in the teacher's dorm…

Without hesitation, Guan Yu threw on shoes and raced out.

"Return before 11 PM lockdown!" the hostel attendant called without looking up from her novel.

Nearing the dorm, raucous shouts erupted.

**Chapter Seventeen: The War God Descends**

Rounding the corner, Guan Yu froze.

Feng Lei—face mummified in bandages—leaned against steps while his mob surrounded Liu Shilei and Mo Ling.

"Where's that bastard? Hand him over or you bitches aren't going anywhere!"

"Can't fuck 'em, but a little groping won't hurt…" A lecherous voice chuckled.

Mo Ling shielded Liu Shilei, pale with fury. "We told you—we don't know!"

"Call the dean then!" A thug sneered. "Our Brother Lei's untouchable—unless the principal wants his family dead!"

"Bitch thinks she's calling cops!" A red-haired youth lunged for Liu Shilei's phone. "I'll strip you right—"

"OVER HERE!" Guan Yu's roar cut through the night.

The mob wheeled around. "Look at this tough guy! You suicidal?"

"That's him! Fucking trash who beat me!" Feng Lei screeched, reviving like a drugged mummy.

With bestial howls, the pack charged—knives and daggers gleaming. Guan Yu backpedaled frantically, scanning for weapons.

A metal frame meant for billboards lay on the lawn—six meters long, half a meter wide. Channeling gravity reduction, he hoisted it effortlessly.

The charging thugs faltered, eyes bulging.

Like a mythic warrior, Guan Yu swung the colossal frame. The leading attackers dove sideways—too slow. With a thunderous arc, the metal beam swept toward them…
