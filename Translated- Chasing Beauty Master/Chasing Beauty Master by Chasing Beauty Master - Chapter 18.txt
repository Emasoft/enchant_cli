“Another winner! What fantastic luck!” Several nearby vendors gathered around enviously, while passersby began pulling out cash, eager to test their fortunes too.

Knowing when to quit, Guan Yu decisively pulled Du Xiaojuan away as the crowd swarmed. Even if those lottery tickets hid fifty-thousand-yuan jackpots, he wouldn’t bite. One win was luck—multiple windfalls would raise eyebrows!

Wealth wasn’t a race. Now that he knew his detection ability worked here, would money ever be a problem? Confidence surged through Guan Yu.

*Hmph*, just a BMW? With a few more lottery stops, he might amass an entire fleet! Money? Guan Yu finally understood what it meant to ride the winds of triumph.

Du Xiaojuan gleefully waved her thousand-yuan prize, claiming credit for their luck. “If it weren’t for my lucky hands, we’d never have won!”

Her childish boast sounded oddly convincing. Watching her tilt her chin proudly and wiggle her oil-stained fingers, Guan Yu chuckled and nudged her shoulder. “Let me see those magic hands!”

“Tsk! Call me *senior* or *elder sister*! You’re younger, junior!” She wrinkled her nose stubbornly.

“Fine, *senior*. Let this junior admire your blessed hands,” Guan Yu teased.

“Hmph! See? Fortune smiles on me! You’re treating me to dinner!” She fluttered her pale fingers before his eyes.

Before she could react, Guan Yu playfully nipped the back of her hand.

“Ah! What are you—?” She yanked her hand back, face burning crimson as she stared at him, flustered.

“Just…thanking your lucky hands!” He grinned roguishly, licking his lips.

“You…jerk!” She stomped her foot and stormed ahead, puffing her cheeks. *How dare he kiss her hand! Yet…why wasn’t she angrier?*

Trailing behind, Guan Yu eyed her sulking posture. “Senior…are you mad?”

“What do you think, you idiot?”

“Sorry. Won’t happen again.”

“Hmph! You’ll make it up to me!”

“How? Bite me back?”

“Ew, no! Take me for spicy crayfish! A huge bucket!” Her eyes sparkled as she clapped excitedly.

“Deal!” Guan Yu marveled at her mercurial moods. *So easy to please.*

After dropping off their purchases at the school guesthouse, they taxied to a bustling food street. Wealthy patrons mingled with students at open-air stalls—the real delicacies thrived here, not in stuffy restaurants.

Guided by Du Xiaojuan’s endless chatter, Guan Yu followed like an attendant. They settled at a stall, where he sipped beer while she attacked a mountain of crayfish.

“Spicy! Gimmie a drink!” She grabbed his cup and gulped, then grimaced. “Ugh! Tastes like horse pee!”

Laughing at her antics, Guan Yu found her childish charm endearing. Between bites, she suddenly asked, “Did you really like Fu Linlin before?”

“Just classmates.”

“She’s pretty…but materialistic.”

“Want me to help you chase her?” She leaned in conspiratorially.

“Enough.” He redirected her to the food.

When she offered him a freshly peeled crayfish, his lips accidentally brushed her fingers.

“Hey! Why bite me?” She yanked her hand back, blushing.

“Tasted good. Next time I win, we feast again.”

Walking back, Du Xiaojuan’s cheer faded. “Fu Linlin will scold me for the bar fight…”

“Why not delay? Let’s wander longer.”

Agreeing, Guan Yu bought birdseed before returning to his room. The front-desk clerk stared—first a music teacher, now this bubbly girl?

Upstairs, Du Xiaojuan wrinkled her nose at the squabs. “Why raise these? They’re messy!”

Guan Yu smiled secretly. *These “ugly” pigeons might hatch a fortune.*

Testing his pet system, he mentally commanded the fledglings. One hopped clumsily, tumbling into his lap.

“So smart!” Du Xiaojuan reached to pet it—and grazed his crotch.

“What’s in your—?” She froze, realization dawning.

“Senior…that’s not a pocket.”

Scarlet-faced, she buried herself in bedsheets while Guan Yu admired her dainty socked feet. *Since when did girls’ feet look…cute?*
