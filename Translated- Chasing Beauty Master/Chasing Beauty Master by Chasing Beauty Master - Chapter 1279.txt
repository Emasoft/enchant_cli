Yunqing Sect, being such a large sect, possessed numerous rules and disciplines. Every disciple entering Bamboo Peak needed to memorize all precepts before being deemed qualified to practice magic. Thus, Bamboo Peak stood as the strictest division within Yunqing Sect.

Any disciple could be tested on any regulation at random and was expected to answer flawlessly. Only those who met this standard received Wood Peak Master's magical teachings. It was universally acknowledged within Yunqing Sect that Bamboo Peak's disciples were the most disciplined.

Among the many disciples of Bamboo Peak, Guan Yu found no trace of Wang Jun's presence. Perhaps the name was merely a coincidence. Of course, Guan Yu couldn't confirm whether this was the same Wang Jun from Kaihuang Academy.

Aze declared, "Guan Yu, watch carefully. I'll definitely win this match."

Guan Yu nodded with a smile. Second Brother Wolf added gravely, "You must win. Only if all three of you succeed can we celebrate tonight. If you lose alone, you'll ruin everyone's mood."

**Chapter 3291: Motionless**

"Hahaha, exactly. Second Brother is right," Aze chuckled. "That's why I said I'll surely win. Rest assured, Second Brother. I can't bear to let you three devour that half of wild boar."

After speaking, Aze walked to one side of the arena. Guan Yu positioned himself where he could clearly observe the opposite side.

From the Bamboo Peak crowd emerged a tall, graceful figure with an alluring gait. Dressed in standard Yunqing Sect robes, the person wore a black wooden hairpin resembling a rod.

This must be Wang Jun. Guan Yu remembered her from Kaihuang Academy—a true beauty with an oval face, cherry lips, and willow-leaf eyebrows. Though her preferences differed and her attire was masculine, nothing could obscure her striking looks.

Yet now, her eyes seemed smaller, her jaw broader, and her skin carried a weathered appearance. Despite these changes, Guan Yu recognized her as Xue Jing's former deskmate. Though barely a year had passed, her transformation puzzled him.

Moreover, Wang Jun was undeniably female. Her previous passionate pursuit of Xue Jing and later interest in Guan Yu had showcased her former beauty. How had Yunqing Sect's members, especially Bamboo Peak disciples, failed to notice her true gender after all this time?

As the crowd quieted, an official announced, "Let both contestants approach. The rules remain unchanged—any violation results in disqualification."

Aze and Wang Jun took their positions five meters apart. Guan Yu shouted, "Aze! Show your full strength!"

Aze responded with a thumbs-up. Hearing Guan Yu's voice, Wang Jun froze mid-step. She turned stiffly, her face paling as if seeing a ghost.

"Guan... Yu?" she whispered.

Guan Yu smiled. "Fancy meeting you here. Quite the coincidence."

"You... How?" Wang Jun stammered, torn between fleeing and staying. "When I heard a new disciple named Guan Yu possessed the Emperor's Seal, I thought it a namesake. But it's truly you!"

"Nothing surprising. If you can come, why not I?"

Distracted and trembling, Wang Jun clearly lost focus. Her secret—maintained through meticulous male impersonation—now teetered on exposure. As Yunqing's "handsome scholar" who attracted female admirers, Guan Yu's presence threatened her carefully constructed facade.

The match commenced. Capitalizing on Wang Jun's distraction, Aze unleashed his spell. Wang Jun barely conjured a weak defensive barrier before Aze's energy blast—resembling a jet engine's roar—shattered her protection and struck true.

Blood sprayed as Wang Jun collapsed three meters back. Bamboo Peak disciples cried foul, but Xuanzhong Peak's supporters retorted, "The match had begun! Should we wait all day for your daydreamer?"

The referee approached. "Can you continue?"

Guan Yu observed Wang Jun's struggle. Though Bamboo Peak's best disciple, her year of training couldn't match Aze's decade of cultivation. Her injuries proved it.

**Chapter 3292: Return to Rest**

"I'm fine," Wang Jun gritted through bloodied lips, rising with her Yunqing Sword's support.

"Bravo, Junior Wang!" cheered Bamboo Peak's disciples.

Yet fresh blood gushed as she collapsed again. Aze's attack, though moderate, had exploited her unguarded state. Conceding defeat, Wang Jun bowed and limped away.

Xuanzhong Peak's victory celebration erupted. Second Brother Wolf murmured to Guan Yu, "These cultivators' physiques are appallingly weak."

Guan Yu pondered—cultivators' spiritual energy should mitigate damage. Had Wang Jun's shock weakened her defenses? He considered pursuing explanations but decided to wait.

As revelry continued, Xiao Zhi returned triumphant from his match. "Now it's your turn this afternoon, Guan Yu. Who's your opponent?"

"Senior Xiaotong from Convergence Peak."

Second Brother Wolf yawned. "I'll nap until dinner. No doubts about your victory."

Aze warned, "Xiaotong's no ordinary opponent. You might need the Emperor's Seal's power."

Xiao Zhi added, "She's trained here since childhood—over a decade of cultivation. Be cautious."

Second Brother Wolf scoffed, "He challenged a Peak Master! A junior disciple? No contest."

**Chapter 3293: Delivering Wine**

As the group dispersed, Xiao Zhi accompanied Guan Yu to Convergence Peak. En route, he asked, "How did you meet Second Brother? He's much older."

"Through battle, five years back," Guan Yu replied vaguely, his memories of meeting Yingzi and Second Brother Wolf remaining hazy.

At Convergence Peak, female disciples greeted Guan Yu warmly but glared at Xiao Zhi. Xiaotong approached, teasing, "No supporters from Tiger Peak?"

"Perhaps they trust my victory," Guan Yu smiled.

Convergence Peak's Master Dai inquired after Second Brother Wolf. Guan Yu hinted, "He's been moody lately."

Master Dai pressed, "Why?" but Guan Yu deflected. Observing Xiaotong's confident stance and the crowd's anticipation, Guan Yu prepared mentally. Tonight's feast awaited—but first, this final trial.
