“Sir, I was wrong. You’re my true lord. Just think of me as a fart and let me go.”

Young Master Feng pleaded desperately, kneeling before Guan Yu.

Guan Yu kicked him to the ground, snarling, “Now you know to beg? Where was all that arrogance when you were posturing upstairs? If not for the power outage, I’d be the one in danger. Would you have spared me then?”

Young Master Feng’s eyes darted. “Yes, yes! I was just joking with you, sir!” He forced a strained smile.

*Crunch!* Guan Yu stomped viciously on Feng’s shin.

“Aaaagh!” Feng writhed on the floor, clutching his shattered leg.

“Joking? Bullshit!” Guan Yu loomed over him. “Stay away from Ah Mei. If you ever lay eyes on her again, next time I’ll crush your skull instead of your leg.”

“I swear! Please, have mercy!”

After Guan Yu left, the Second-in-Command emerged from the shadows. He’d witnessed everything but cared little for Feng. Had Guan Yu slit the fool’s throat, he wouldn’t have intervened.

“Good heavens! What happened here?” the Second-in-Command feigned alarm. “Quick! Get Young Master Feng to the hospital!”

The henchmen, still trembling from Guan Yu’s display, carried Feng away. His leg would never heal properly—a permanent cripple.

**Chapter 1843: The Eggshell**

Guan Yu advised Wei Hongwei to discard the illegal firearm. Later, Mac’s Bar underwent intense scrutiny due to the gunfire—a reminder that A City’s power struggles weren’t just underworld affairs but corporate rivalries.

Returning home, Guan Yu found Ah Mei asleep, comforted by Xue Jing. Lü Mei had left with Uncle Wang.

Dawn found Guan Yu practicing in the courtyard. Though he hadn’t slept, his energy surged. His speed, once draining at full tilt, now felt effortless. Combat itself seemed to hone his skills mysteriously.

“To grow stronger without conscious cultivation... I must be unique in this world.”

As he channeled his energy, a golden aura enveloped him—an Eggshell of pure Yang energy. This defensive barrier could repel attacks,反弹ing damage proportional to its strength. Detonating it unleashed area-of-effect strikes.

Through introspection, Guan Yu realized his Yang energy was assimilating Yin energy absorbed from Pan Xiaoxia. This fusion fueled his passive growth.

“Hmm?” Guan Yu started as delicate arms embraced him from behind. Only Ah Mei could approach so gently through his barrier.

“Guan Yu? Did I disturb you?” Ah Mei retreated, alarmed by his reaction.

“No, it’s...” He blinked, then called, “Xue Jing! Come here!”

A groggy Xue Jing emerged in a translucent green nightgown. “Ugh, what now?”

“Hug me.”

“You’re insane.” She lunged playfully—only to be repelled by the Eggshell, crashing onto the steps.

“You bastard! Trying to kill your wife?” she groaned.

Rushing to her side, Guan Yu had an epiphany: The Eggshell only repelled cultivators. Ordinary people like Ah Mei could bypass it—a critical flaw.

“Ah Mei, you’ve helped me discover a weakness!” he exclaimed.

Xue Jing mock-charged again, but Ah Mei intervened tearfully. “Don’t hurt him! Punish me instead!”

The pair exchanged amused glances. “We’re joking, Ah Mei,” Xue Jing sighed. “I couldn’t beat him if I tried.”

**Chapter 1844: The Young Man**

Post-breakfast, Ah Mei left for concert preparations. Guan Yu and Xue Jing planned to accompany her, but Lü Mei summoned Guan Yu to escort her.

At the Lü estate’s prison-like gates, a smug guard blocked Guan Yu. “Dream on, peasant. The Young Mistress doesn’t meet trash.”

“Call Lü Mei,” Guan Yu demanded via phone. “And request an ambulance.”

When the guard continued taunting, Guan Yu’s kick sent him flying into the iron gates. Lü Mei arrived to find her uncle’s friend’s son unconscious.

“Must you assault everyone?” she chided, driving off in a red convertible.

**Chapter 1845: Envy**

At the packed stadium, Yang Conghan arrived with a five-car entourage. “New flame?” Lü Mei teased, noting Guan Yu’s glance.

“We’re both from the Four Great Families,” she explained. “Of course I know her.”

As Yang battled through reporters, she spotted Guan Yu. “Here for the concert?”

“Ah Mei’s a friend.”

Lü Mei clung to Guan Yu’s arm. “Father says the Fengs will retaliate for breaking their heir’s leg.”

“Let them try.” Guan Yu smirked. “I’ll be waiting.”
