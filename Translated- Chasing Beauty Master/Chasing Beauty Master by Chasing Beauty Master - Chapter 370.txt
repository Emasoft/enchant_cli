“You’re gonna get yourself killed!” Xiaonao roared.

“But I was just—” Zamao mumbled, shrinking under Xiaonao’s glare.

“Shut your trap and drive! That bastard wiped out our car dealership overnight. You think we’re a match for him? This ain’t our fight—higher-ups’ll handle it. Just tail ’em and shut up!”

Zamao swallowed hard, hands trembling on the wheel. Ahead, Guan Yu’s Mercedes accelerated onto the highway.

“Wrong way,” Li Xi murmured, eyeing the dark stretch of road.

Guan Yu smirked. “You catch on quick. Baiting the tiger into the den, huh?”

Li Xi arched an eyebrow. “You’re walking into their trap.”

“Their trap?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Or mine?”

The Mercedes roared forward, tires screeching. Behind them, a nondescript Peugeot clung to their tail.

“Faster!” Xiaonao barked.

Zamao stomped the gas, swerving dangerously. “They’re headin’ for the hills! What’s the play, boss?”

“Keep close. Let the big dogs handle the kill.” Xiaonao’s grin turned vicious. “Dragon Tian’s on the job. That pretty boy’s road ends tonight.”

Zamao’s eyes widened. “D-Dragon Tian? The Legend?”

“The one and only. Now drive, moron!”

Guan Yu glanced at the rearview. “Flies on the wall. Let’s give ’em a show.”

He downshifted, the Mercedes surging ahead. Li Xi gripped her seat as the engine howled.

“You’re mad,” she breathed.

“Mad enough to bury a dynasty.” Guan Yu’s knuckles whitened on the wheel. “Hold tight, princess. Time to dance with dragons.”

The night swallowed them whole.

**Chapter 930: Luring the Tiger from Its Lair**

The Mercedes tore through the darkness, its headlights slicing the highway. Behind, the Peugeot lurched, struggling to keep pace.

“Dammit! He’s pulling away!” Zamao cursed.

Xiaonao slammed the dashboard. “Stay on him! Dragon’s crew’ll block the exits. That bastard dies tonight!”

***

Guan Yu’s smirk hardened. “Let’s see how hungry your dragons are.”

He spun the wheel, the car fishtailing into a hairpin turn. Li Xi’s nails dug into leather.

“You’re insane!”

“Insane?” Guan Yu laughed. “Wait till the fireworks start.”

A black Lamborghini materialized ahead, engine snarling.

**Chapter 931: Car Race**

Tires screamed.

The Lamborghini charged, its driver a silhouette of menace. Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed.

“Showtime.”

Engines roared. The highway became a battleground.
