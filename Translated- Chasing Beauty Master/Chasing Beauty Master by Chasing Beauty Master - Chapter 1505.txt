Guan Yu roughly calculated that the suit of armor required substantial materials, while the purchased white sinew could undoubtedly craft three hand crossbows without issue.

As for the materials to be used for Xuan Ming and others, they would employ those provided by Master Li. Moreover, superior quality materials couldn't be casually purchased – their acquisition depended on fortunate encounters rather than forced pursuit.

Wang Xiaorong always felt her time with Guan Yu passed too swiftly. Before they knew it, the day had flown by. Now that Guan Yu needed to resolve Liu Yun's affairs in town, it would be inappropriate for her to follow.

"After settling tonight's matters, will you return to Cloud Azure Sect?" Wang Xiaorong asked unwillingly, her voice tinged with reluctance.

Guan Yu nodded. "Indeed. This excursion has lasted long enough. I need to return for dedicated research. Rest assured – the moment these hand crossbows are completed, you'll be the first to receive one."

"Father mentioned he urgently wishes to meet you. When might you visit Demonic Soul Sect?"

"The Demon Lord seeks me? Doubtless with ill intent – does he plan to restrict my movements again?" Guan Yu's tone turned guarded.

Wang Xiaorong sighed, knowing mutual distrust remained the greatest barrier between Guan Yu and her father. "This time, it's about your firearm. After you wounded Yanzao with it, Father grew intensely curious. He wants to examine it personally."

"Plotting to confiscate my pistol, is he? Tell him to abandon such hopes! If he lays eyes on it, I'll never see it again." Guan Yu waved dismissively, his reluctance to visit deepening upon discerning the Demon Lord's motives.

Though disheartened, Wang Xiaorong didn't press further. Her heart warred between longing for Guan Yu's company and fearing her father's potential treachery. What if this meeting became an ambush for assassination and plunder? The thought of inadvertently causing Guan Yu's demise haunted her.

Observing her downcast expression, Guan Yu reassured, "Don't fret. We'll reunite soon – when the crossbows are complete, I'll seek you out immediately. Even if the project fails, you'll be the first to know."

"If opportunity allows," Wang Xiaorong implored, "please come to Demonic Soul Sect soon. At least drive away that detestable Yanzao!"

"What? Yanzao's at Demonic Soul Sect?" Guan Yu's brows furrowed. "That cockroach still lives? His leg must be crippled at least?"

"His injury proved severe – ordinary physicians couldn't treat it. Father deemed him useful and ordered Three-Headed Brother to heal him. Though reluctant given Yanzao's crimes in the bamboo forest, he couldn't refuse Father's command."

"That scoundrel fled Cloud Azure Sect only to find sanctuary with your father?" Guan Yu scoffed bitterly. "Truly, virtue goes unrewarded while vice runs rampant."

"Whenever I see him, disgust overwhelms me. Guan Yu, you must eliminate him when possible!" Wang Xiaorong clenched her fists. "There's more – Father plans to send Three-Headed Brother to Crimson Lotus Sect to rescue Six-Headed Wolf King, with Yanzao accompanying them."

"So the Demon Lord still finds value in that cur. Fortune favors vermin indeed."

As they reached the inn, Guan Yu stored his belongings and instructed Liu Yun before departing for town with Wang Jun.

"Will you return tomorrow? Let me wait here to bid proper farewell," Wang Xiaorong insisted, willing to endure staying with Liu Yun's family for this chance.

Chapter 3903: A Brilliant Notion

Unable to refuse, Guan Yu acquiesced. Wang Xiaorong's presence at the inn provided added security for Liu Yun's household anyway.

Returning to Liu Yun's home under night's cover, Guan Yu and Wang Jun changed into black stealth attire, preparing to infiltrate the yamen. With the Prefect's men arriving tomorrow, they needed concrete evidence tonight to implicate both Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li.

The yamen lay silent in the dead hours. Guan Yu stealthily approached the magistrate's favored pavilion, peering through windows to find Pang lounging disheveled with two serving girls.

Young Master Li entered moments later, flanked by women. "Still exhausted from taming those shrews?" Magistrate Pang mocked as Li collapsed onto a fur rug.

"One particularly stubborn bitch resists all methods," Li grumbled. "With ten days until delivery, I need new strategies."

"Women always break eventually," Pang shrugged, pulling a girl onto his lap.

Li glared. "Your complacency helps naught! These aren't common whores – their purity must remain intact for maximum value. Conventional methods fail."

"Starve them then," Pang suggested. "Hunger breaks all pride."

"Risks damaging their appearance. I need alternatives." Li's eyes suddenly gleamed. "I've conceived a plan. We'll stage a selection – you pose as a slaver choosing disobedient ones for brutal servitude. Fear of worse fate may compel obedience."

"Brilliant!" Pang chuckled. "Let's implement this immediately."

Unbeknownst to them, Guan Yu eavesdropped with satisfaction – this charade would lead him straight to the captives' location.

Chapter 3904: Underground Passage

After allowing the conspirators time to eat, Guan Yu trailed them to the yamen's rear courtyard. Behind a lumber pile, Li manipulated a hidden mechanism, revealing stone steps descending underground.

The partners disappeared into the tunnel, its entrance camouflaged by stacked wood. Guan Yu noted every detail – tomorrow, the Prefect's men would uncover this prison beneath the magistrate's own domain.

Within the subterranean chamber, iron cages held six women surrounded by gruesome torture implements. Li theatrically presented Magistrate Pang as a cruel slaver. "This lord enjoys breaking spirited women," Pang growled, eyeing the prisoners. "Which ones defy you most?"

Li pointed to a quiet woman dubbed Little Plum Blossom. "This one's particularly recalcitrant. She'll suit your tastes perfectly."

As the charade unfolded above, Guan Yu retreated, evidence secured. Come dawn, justice would descend upon this corrupt house.
