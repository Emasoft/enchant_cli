“If you continue to disrespect my friend, there’s no need for us to dine together anymore,” Gao Wei said coldly.



“Seems you still don’t understand me. The weak exist to be bullied. He is weak. And so are you,” Zhou Hongyan declared arrogantly.



“What exactly do you want?” Gao Wei asked, his face darkening.



“Heh, you should know very well what I want, Weiwei. I’ve always valued your talent. I want you to join my company. I’ll make you Asia’s newest star,” Zhou Hongyan said.



“Impossible!” Gao Wei refused without hesitation.



“Weiwei, do you still have the right to refuse?” Zhou Hongyan retorted confidently.



“I can make you famous, or I can ruin you completely.”



“Give me the footage!” Gao Wei demanded.



“Fine. But you must become my woman,” Zhou Hongyan sneered.



“You… shameless!” Gao Wei trembled with rage, cursing.



Zhou Hongyan’s expression darkened. “I admire you, but that doesn’t mean I’ll indulge you. Take back your words now, or face the consequences.”



*Slap!*

A resounding slap echoed through the private room. Gao Wei glared furiously at Zhou Hongyan.



She had always maintained a pure, jade-like public image—not just a label, but a reflection of her principled character.



“Bitch! You dare hit me?” The vivid handprint on Zhou Hongyan’s face ignited his fury. He swung back, but his wrist was caught mid-air.



“Women can hit men when they deserve it. But men who hit women are scum who deserve worse!” Guan Yu gripped Zhou Hongyan’s wrist, smiling coldly.



Zhou Hongyan struggled futilely. “Xiao Chen! Throw him out!”



Xiao Chen lunged at Guan Yu, aiming a punch at his face. With a contemptuous smirk, Guan yanked Zhou Hongyan as a shield. Xiao Chen recoiled, but Guan Yu’s foot connected with his chest, sending him crashing through chairs.



“Pathetic. This trash calls himself a bodyguard?” Guan Yu scoffed.



“Do you know who I am? I’ll have you jailed forever!” Zhou Hongyan threatened.



“You said it yourself—the weak only get bullied.” Guan Yu’s fist, amplified by his gravity system, smashed into Zhou Hongyan’s abdomen.



*Thud!*

Zhou Hongyan crumpled against the wall, vomiting blood. “Bastard!” he rasped.



Guan Yu crouched beside him. “I’ll give you one chance to retract your threats. Or suffer the consequences.”



Zhou Hongyan’s eyes burned with hatred. “You’ll regret crossing me!”



“Where’s the video storage?” Guan Yu demanded.



“You’ll never find it without me!” Zhou Hongyan spat.



Guan宇冷笑，拨通电话：“林东，去西郊别墅取视频。”



Later, Guan宇 received a call that turned his smile to fury. He kicked Zhou Hongyan viciously. “You filthy pervert! Because of you, I’m the joke now!”



When newcomers arrived, Guan宇 pointed to a flamboyant man. “He’s your playmate tonight. Make him scream.”



The drag queen licked crimson lips. “Oh, he’ll scream alright.”



As the drag queen dragged Zhou Hongyan away, Guan宇 muttered: “Fucking hell.”
