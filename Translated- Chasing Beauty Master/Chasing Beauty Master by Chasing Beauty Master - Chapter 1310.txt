“That’s right, they’re newcomers. Just showing them around to broaden their horizons,” Black Wolf declared smugly, implying he’d gained two new underlings in Black Blood Ridge for others to envy.

Senior Brother Qi remarked, “Perfect timing. The Blood Lord just assigned me a task requiring two disciples. Since they’re here, Brother Wolf won’t mind lending these two to me?”

Black Wolf thumped his chest. “Not at all. Let the rookies gain experience—it’ll do them good.”

“Excellent. Follow me,” Senior Brother Qi said, striding forward without looking back. Guan Yu and Siqi bowed slightly to Black Wolf before trailing behind.

Navigating winding passages, Guan Yu and Siqi grew uneasy. If Senior Brother Qi led them straight to the Blood Lord’s lair and exposed Guan Yu’s identity, they’d be doomed. Yet with uncertainty lingering, they pressed on silently until entering a stone chamber.

“How did you get in here?” Senior Brother Qi turned abruptly.

“Senior Brother Qi! I can’t believe it’s really you!” Siqi exclaimed joyfully.

“Shh!” He raised a warning finger. “Lower your voice! Do you want the whole ridge to hear?”

Siqi flinched, then whispered urgently, “Why are you here? We came to rescue Xiaotong! The Blood Lord captured her—surely you know?”

Glancing outside to confirm no eavesdroppers, he replied, “Of course. She’s imprisoned in the Blood Lord’s cavern. I saw her recently—she’s safe for now. I’m working on a plan.”

His gaze shifted to Guan Yu. “Who’s this? I don’t recognize him.”

Guan Yu bowed. “Junior Brother Guan Yu greets Senior Brother Qi.”

“You’re Guan Yu?” Senior Brother Qi scrutinized him. “The Blood Lord is hunting you! Have you lost your minds coming here? With your skills, rescuing Xiaotong is suicide!”

**Chapter 3378: Proceeding in Secret**

Having infiltrated Black Blood Ridge for years, Senior Brother Qi now enjoyed Black Leopard’s full trust and commanded respect among subordinates. His wit had also earned the Blood Lord’s favor. Though he’d never met Guan Yu, rumors of the youth’s three coveted treasures were well-known.

The temptation to kill Guan Yu and seize the artifacts flickered through his mind—or perhaps delivering him to the Blood Lord might grant a share of the spoils. Yet with Siqi present and his façade to maintain, he suppressed the impulse.

“We’re not alone,” Siqi interjected. “Xiao Zhi, Aze, and Guan Yu’s friends are here too.”

“How did you enter?” Senior Brother Qi frowned. “The Poplar Forest defenses are impenetrable without guidance from at least a squad leader.”

“Guan Yu’s friend guided us through,” Siqi explained, tactfully omitting Wang Xiaorong’s true identity.

Senior Brother Qi’s eyes narrowed. “Regardless, you mustn’t act rashly. The Blood Lord’s power exceeds your imagination. But this chaos presents an opportunity—follow my orders strictly.”

Siqi nodded eagerly, reassured by his leadership.

“Where are your companions now?” Senior Brother Qi pressed.

“We split up to search. No idea where they are.”

“Disastrous if they’re caught.” He grimaced. “Stay with me. We’ll locate them quietly—this operation requires utmost secrecy.”

Traversing labyrinthine tunnels, Guan Yu memorized routes. The Blood Lord’s cavern lay beyond where they’d met Senior Brother Qi—a location to etch in memory.

Commotion ahead revealed a prison crammed with civilians—likely fodder for the demonic bull’s sustenance. A guard lounging on a stone table leapt up obsequiously.

“Just inspecting,” Senior Brother Qi said airily. “Stay vigilant.”

Departing, they navigated fork after fork of artificial tunnels until reaching dormitory-like caves. A subordinate bowed as they passed—revealed as Wang Xiaorong when Guan Yu called out.

“This is Wang Xiaorong, our guide,” Guan Yu introduced.

Senior Brother Qi’s eyes narrowed at the Demon Soul Sect disciple. “Let’s keep moving.”

**Chapter 3380: Between Tiger and Abyss**

Exploring storage areas yielded no leads until wine aromas wafted through a passage. “The wine cellar,” Senior Brother Qi identified. “Only opened for celebrations.”

“My friend might be there,” Guan Yu said, knowing Second-to-Wolf’s weakness.

The cellar’s broken lock confirmed their suspicions. Inside, Second-to-Wolf emerged with a jar, drawling, “Save your breath. I heard you coming.”

“You’re drinking during a rescue?!” Senior Brother Qi snapped.

“Not my circus,” the drunk retorted. “I’m here for Guan Yu.”

Tension crackled until Senior Brother Qi ordered them to hide in the cellar while he retrieved others.

Amid aging wine racks, Second-to-Wolf chuckled. “Try some? Vintage stuff!”

Guan Yu eyed dust-caked jars. “Enough here to blow the whole ridge sky-high.” A plan crystallized—after rescuing Xiaotong, ignite this arsenal.

Alone now, Senior Brother Qi wandered gambling dens, masking calculations. If Guan Yu failed, Xiaotong would become Black Leopard’s plaything before being sacrificed. But saving her at the brink would maximize his glory. The game deepened.
