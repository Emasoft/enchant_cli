Feng Xin gritted her pearly white teeth and viciously pinched Guan Yu's thigh under the table. She now fully realized Guan Yu was a philandering scoundrel—just when you thought his list of women had ended, several more would inexplicably appear out of nowhere.

She truly couldn't fathom Guan Yu's appeal, entangled with so many women. Yet when recalling her own ambiguous relationship with him, bitter resentment surged in her heart.

Their brief peace was shattered when the private dining room's door crashed open again. A burly, arrogant man stormed in bellowing, "Which blind cur dares strike Young Master Park?"

Chapter 398: The Enraged Patriarch Feng

Originally invited by Park Xu to dine, Patriarch Feng had excused himself to the restroom due to stomach discomfort. Returning to find Park Xu writhing on the floor in agony, his face darkened. Having dominated N City for decades, this insult to his guest on his own turf was intolerable. Thus Xu Dalong barged in roaring with rage.

But upon seeing the three elder statesmen seated at the table, Xu Dalong froze as if encountering ghosts. Without hesitation, he turned to flee while praying they hadn't recognized him.

As he pivoted, the sharp clatter of chopsticks against porcelain froze him in place. Deathly pale, he knew escape was impossible.

"Xu Dalong! You've grown bold enough to curse your own grandfather?" Patriarch Feng thundered.

Xu Dalong turned laboriously before collapsing to his knees. "Grandfather! Had I known you dined here, ten lifetimes' courage wouldn't have made me offend you!"

Unmoved by the prostration, Patriarch Feng hurled his chopsticks. Blood immediately streaked Xu Dalong's face.

Guan Yu observed inwardly—the old man clearly possessed formidable skills.

Still unsatisfied, Patriarch Feng roared, "You've disgraced our family name, worthless spawn!" His anger mounting at this public humiliation before peers, he raised a bowl to hurl.

Guan Yu intercepted him. "Patriarch Feng, spare your wrath. He came to avenge Park Xu—in some ways, this shows Xu Dalong's loyalty. You're fortunate having such a grandson."

The patriarch's fury abated slightly. "Eloquent words, though I know this whelp's measure. Were he half the man you are..." He glared at the kneeling figure. "Rise! Today you're spared by Guan Yu's plea. We'll settle this later."

Xu Dalong shot Guan Yu a grateful look, recognizing him as the "pauper" from hotel encounters. How had this youth gained such favor with the patriarchs? Especially Patriarch Feng's gaze—it resembled a grandfather inspecting his future grandson-in-law.

His mind reeled recalling cousin Xu Bin's warning: "This man is beyond your reach." Cold sweat drenched his back.

Rising, Xu Dalong bowed to Guan Yu. "Brother, I apologize for past offenses."

"Past offenses?" Patriarch Feng's glare intensified. "Harm one hair on Guan Yu's head, and I'll end you myself!"

Xu Dalong's resentment swelled—was Guan Yu the true blood heir? Yet this only emphasized Guan Yu's importance.

Ignoring the subtext, Guan Yu asked, "Where's Park Xu? He's not one to concede defeat."

Xu Dalong shook his head blankly—he'd charged in upon seeing Park Xu's state, unaware of subsequent developments.

As if summoned, Park Xu entered pale-faced, trailed by five hulking men in suits and sunglasses. His venomous gaze locked on Guan Yu. "Today you die, Guan Yu."

Guan Yu smirked. "Such an entourage—your conscience must weigh heavy."

"You pauper dare judge me?" Park Xu sneered, noticing Xu Dalong's bleeding forehead. "Brother Xu! Did he strike you? I'll avenge this!"

Xu Dalong frantically signaled warnings, ignored as Park Xu blustered, "Fear not! Five bodyguards will crush him!"

Xu Dalong's eyelid twitched. These guests represented N City's underworld elite—Park Xu's men were lambs entering a dragon's den. "Let's depart. This place isn't worth..."

Feng Xin cut in coldly: "You command nothing here. He stays." Learning Park Xu had imprisoned Guan Yu, her fury burned. This was her territory—how dare he strut?

Xu Dalong gaped, baffled by her rage, casting sympathetic glances at the oblivious Park Xu.

Unaware of the gathering's significance, Park Xu leered at Feng Xin. "Pretty face, sharp tongue. Think your hotel owner status impresses? Cross me, and you'll beg scraps tomorrow!"

Xu Dalong's vision darkened—this fool poured oil on flames.

Spotting Guan Yu, Park Xu sneered, "Ah, the pauper's whore! Retract my words—you'll beg tomorrow! Though with those looks, brothels might pay well..."

Xu Dalong's eyelid spasmed—even the Three Associations Group's heir wouldn't survive this.

Feng Xin's face darkened murderously. Guan Yu gazed at Park Xu with pity—this was his end.

Before Feng Xin moved, Patriarch Feng's palm slammed the table, splitting solid sandalwood with a thunderous crack. "Who dares?!"

Chapter 399: Stripped and Tossed

The patriarch's aura stunned Guan Yu. The table's fissure testified to unprecedented wrath—even fellow patriarchs seemed understanding.

Rising slowly, Patriarch Feng intoned, "Youth! If your parents failed to teach decency, I shall." His measured steps belied lethal precision—each pace equidistant, revealing martial mastery.

A bodyguard lunged with contemptuous punch. The patriarch caught the fist effortlessly. "Weak." A sudden crouch, then a thunderous strike sent the man flying unconscious.

Still water runs deep—true mastery reveals itself in motion.

The remaining guards paled, retreating as the patriarch advanced. Park Xu flushed with humiliation. "Four against one fossil? Disgraceful! Cripple him—I take responsibility!"

The guards attacked simultaneously. Two minutes later, all lay moaning on floorboards. Guan Yu marveled—he'd never witnessed such prowess from his teacher.

Park Xu trembled—this felt like bad cinema where random elders become martial gods. He prayed for no sequels.

"Youth," the patriarch said softly before Park Xu, "humility suits the living."

"Sanxie Group will crush your flea-pit hotel!" Park Xu blustered.

"Sanxie? Unknown." The patriarch's dismissive shake enraged Park Xu, whose retort died as a fist smashed his abdomen, sending him crashing into closed doors.

To Feng Xin, the patriarch said tenderly, "Handle the rest."

She summoned a dozen hulking enforcers radiating violence. Park Xu finally grasped these weren't hotel staff—they were the underworld itself.

As Feng Xin moved to act, Guan Yu interjected with a grin, "Sis Xin, let me settle old scores. How dare he insult my woman? I'll cook his goose."

Feng Xin's cheeks flushed crimson at the public claim. Her men gaped—their iron lady bashful? Patriarch Feng beamed, earlier fury forgotten.

A henchman asked Guan Yu, "How to handle them, Brother Yu?"

"Bind the five. Strip that one naked and toss him out—let him winter-streak."

Chapter 400: Li Yuanshan's Call

The henchman blinked at the eccentric order. Even the patriarchs stared—this humiliation exceeded death for a celebrity.

"You wouldn't dare!" Park Xu snarled.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Why not? Fans will thank me for their idol's free show. Leave his underpants—wouldn't want frostbite ruining his 'assets'."

As henchmen dragged him out, Park Xu screamed, "I'll kill you, Guan Yu!"

The next day's headlines blared: "Pop King Park Xu's Winter Streak—Fetish or Madness?" Mobbed by fans for three rescue hours, he emerged frostbitten and traumatized.

Back in the dining room, elders regarded Guan Yu strangely. "It's noon, but temperatures hit -15°C," Patriarch Xu mused. "That cloth won't protect certain... assets."

Guan Yu reddened—now understanding "shameless old rogue."
