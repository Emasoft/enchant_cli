“Go to hell! Do you think everyone here is a child? Or do you believe Ma Tong’s men are all useless?” The man whose foot had been stepped on spat. “Just these five or six people are more than enough to handle an old coot like you. If you can take them down today, I’ll call you grandpa! But if you get caught, don’t blame me for spitting in your face later. Hahaha…”

The man cackled maliciously. Luo Bo sneered inwardly. Backed against the wall with nowhere to retreat, he suddenly shouted, “Fine! Let everyone here bear witness! Today, I’ll accept this grandson!”

Without hesitation, Luo Bo hefted a large chair beside him and hurled it at the group. His movements were startlingly swift, and in that instant, his frail elderly demeanor vanished entirely, making him appear decades younger.

The thugs hadn’t expected the old man to strike so decisively. They’d assumed subduing him would be simple, but Luo Bo’s ferocity stunned them.

Yet this attack held no inner energy—it was merely a distraction. The chair crashed to the floor as the men dodged, splintering into pieces with a thunderous crack.

Now armed with two thick wooden rods from the chair’s remnants, Luo Bo brandished them like weapons. These were no ordinary thugs; under Ju Niu’s command, they’d completed countless tasks for Ma Tong. Arrogance had blinded them to the old man’s skill.

The situation shifted. The five men exchanged glances before simultaneously flipping open their jackets, drawing half-meter-long machetes from their backs.

Ju Niu frowned. An ordinary elder would’ve wet himself by now, yet this man had shattered the chair with precise control—not too forcefully to leave useless splinters, nor too weakly to preserve it. The calculated move had forced his men back while leaving Luo Bo with perfect makeshift weapons.

Anticipating hidden blades, Luo Bo feigned limitation, clashing his rods against their machetes.

“Don’t kill him! Take him alive!” Ju Niu ordered. Over a dozen men surged forward, eager to pummel the “arrogant old fool.”

The foot-stomped man smirked inwardly, relishing Luo Bo’s impending humiliation.

As the first five attackers lunged, Luo Bo’s rods became blurs. He targeted noses with surgical precision—cracking nasal bones, spraying blood, rendering opponents writhing. Within breaths, three men lay incapacitated, faces ruined.

Spectators recoiled at the carnage. Blood pooled as Luo Bo roared, “You bastards think you can bully an old man? I’ll show you!”

A discerning eye would recognize Luo Bo’s expertise. Against armed opponents, he remained untouched while wielding splintered rods like extensions of his will. Each strike brought perverse satisfaction as wood spikes pierced flesh.

“Enough!” Luo Bo suddenly bellowed, halting the remaining attackers. “Tend to your men before they bleed out. I’ve no taste for killing.”

Ju Niu reluctantly waved for medics. Luo Bo pressed his advantage: “Let me settle affairs first. Then you may try.”

Turning to the foot-stomper, he demanded, “Kowtow, grandson! Where’s your Confucian respect?”

The man flushed crimson as spectators jeered. “That was a joke, you senile—”

Wind whipped. Before he finished, Luo Bo’s rod smashed his nose flat.

“Gah!” The man collapsed, choking on blood. Luo Bo loomed coldly. “That’s the price of arrogance. Next time, I’ll break your jaw.”

Ju Niu paled. Even with reinforcements, they stood no chance. Luo Bo stretched lazily. “Since my grandson reneges, I’ll take my leave.”

Trembling thugs parted like mist. At the casino exit, Luo Bo cashed his winnings, marveling at Billin’s genius—profitable stress relief!

**Chapter 2727: The Cat-and-Mouse Game**

Ju Niu tailed Luo Bo’s white SUV with a decrepit van. The elder led them on a merry chase—stopping at Guan Yu’s mansion (“He’s not home?”), then Feng Manor (“Billin’s away?”), circling until…

The van occupants froze. Luo Bo parked before their own casino, announcing loudly, “Ma Tong’s absent? I’ll return!”

As the baffled trio reported, Ma Tong exploded: “Another expert? Track him to hell!”

Unbeknownst to them, Luo Bo drove off whistling, already planning his next “stress-relief” visit.
