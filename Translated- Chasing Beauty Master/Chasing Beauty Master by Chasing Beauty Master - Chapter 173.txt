After listening to Li Xi's analysis, Guan Yu suddenly realized that even if she hadn't previously known his whereabouts at the café, she could have deduced his location with astonishing speed. Her razor-sharp deductive abilities left him awestruck - he'd merely mentioned "military" and she'd instantly unraveled all strategic implications.

"There will be a way," Guan Yu replied with a mysterious smile.

Watching his confident expression, Li Xi found herself reassessing the man before her. First proposing such an enticing concept, then suggesting military collaboration - could this rural-born college graduate who'd risen meteorically in City N's underworld and elite circles within six months have military connections? The discrepancies in his profile puzzled her deeply.

She began understanding why her father held this young man in such high regard. Guan Yu radiated an enigmatic aura that defied conventional explanation.

Her failed investigation into his military ties became clearer - though aware of Li Jing'er's existence, few knew the girl's true identity as Zhao Zilong's granddaughter due to her rare medical condition.

"You've helped me evaluate this. What's my compensation?" Li Xi's lips curved slightly, her voice soft as moonlight.

Though subtle, Guan Yu clearly witnessed that fleeting smile - as ephemeral as a night-blooming cereus yet breathtakingly beautiful.

"You should smile more often," he blurted, momentarily entranced. "Goddesses lose their charm when too icy."

Li Xi blinked in surprise at his boldness.

Guan Yu recovered smoothly, "This concept originated from you. Upon realization, you'll receive 1% equity. Acceptable?"

Stunned, Li Xi regarded him like some exotic creature. "Do you comprehend the value of 1%?"

Her original intent had been modest profit-sharing, yet this offer dwarfed all expectations. Even with her 140 IQ, the calculations overwhelmed her momentarily.

"Money's just paper to me," Guan Yu waved magnanimously. "Your father's supported me tremendously - this is deserved. Moreover, we're merely conceptualizing. Implementation rests on you - I'm clueless here. When operational, I'll handle military liaisons. Request additional compensation if needed."

His words struck Li Xi profoundly. Despite her composure, she marveled at his visionary generosity, finally appreciating her father's shrewd investment - that billion yuan might prove bargain for Guan Yu's potential.

Her gaze softened imperceptibly. "You'd entrust such crucial matters to me?"

"You'll outperform me, and I trust Elder Li implicitly."

Nodding decisively, Li Xi conceded, "I'll draft the proposal promptly for your approval."

As they settled logistics, Guan Yu inquired, "Where's Elder Li? I must thank him properly during this Beijing visit."

"Occupied with urgent matters. He'll contact us post-engagement. I'll manage your itinerary henceforth."

Guan Yu shrugged agreeably. Navigating Beijing's unfamiliar terrain with this peerless beauty as guide suited him perfectly.

"What's next?"

"Accompany me to an alumni gathering."

Guan Yu's expression turned quizzical. "This...is scheduled? Wouldn't my presence be intrusive?"

Li Xi checked her watch. "No objections permitted. We depart now."

Before he could protest, she strode decisively outward. Chuckling at her domineering manner, Guan Yu followed - secretly admiring her swaying hips while suppressing urges to swat that haughty derriere.

Chapter 427: Boyfriend?

Their exit sparked commotion - men groaned at the goddess accompanying a seemingly ordinary man, while women sighed relief at escaping comparison. This encounter birthed café folklore: subsequent couples exiting those doors inevitably dissolved relationships, men deluded by Guan Yu's example into believing they deserved goddesses, women fearing future infidelity.

Unaware of their societal impact, Guan Yu trailed Li Xi to her Maserati - its flamboyant elegance mirroring her icy allure. The luxury car-beauty pairing finally made visceral sense.

Their silent drive halted at Leisong International Plaza.

"Unusual venue for reunions," Guan Yu remarked, earning Li Xi's disdainful glance. She marched into an Armani boutique, selecting suit and shoes.

"Try these."

"My current attire suffices."

"Attend my gathering dressed thus?" Her arched brow brooked no argument.

As salesgirls eyed him like gigolo, Guan Yu sulked into changing rooms. Emerging transformed, even Li Xi's eyes brightened - tailored lines accentuating latent charisma.

Salesgirls cooed approval: "Sir's fortunate having such stylish, devoted girlfriend!"

Guan Yu's awkward chuckle met Li Xi's silent card swipe. En route, he jested: "Do we resemble lovers?"

"Tend your City N harem first," she retorted icily.

Their journey culminated at an exclusive riverside club - Harvard alumni bastion where bamboo groves harmonized with modernist architecture, natural hot springs infusing teas that drew Beijing's elite.

Chapter 428: Confession

Approached by curvaceous hostess Lin Lin (ol-clad with lethal stilettos), Guan Yu's appreciative gaze noted professional charm versus Li Xi's glacial beauty.

"XiXi! We've awaited your arrival. And this gentleman...?"

"Guan Yu."

"Our Ice Queen acquired a boyfriend!" Lin Lin's peal laughter jiggled assets Guan Yu valiantly ignored.

"Apparently we're compatible," Guan Yu teased.

Li Xi's glacial retort chilled: "Dare you presume?"

Lin Lin gaped at their dynamic - Harvard's untouchable goddess bantering with this youth?

"Lin Lin," Li Xi identified her stunned friend.

Recovering, the hostess extended manicured hand: "Pleasure, Guan Yu...didi."

"Epithets affect renal health," he deadpanned, dodging her flirtatious pinch.

When pressed about their relationship, Guan Yu truthfully confessed: "Met three hours prior."

Lin Lin's scrutiny intensified. "Nothing extraordinary here. XiXi's taste declined?"

Guan Yu's eye-roll screamed 'uncultured swine' as Li Xi interjected: "The venue's her creation."

Impressed, Guan Yu's compliments died as Lin Lin whispered ominously: "Wait till they see you. Especially Wang Jie..."

Following them inside, Guan Yu sensed impending drama. Lin Lin's conspiratorial whisper confirmed: "Big surprise awaits!"

Resigned to his fate as human shield, Guan Yu entered the lion's den...
