Young Master Feng could no longer tolerate Guan Yu's existence. The mere thought of eliminating his rival and claiming Guan Yu's beauties for himself drove him to purchase an array of new "toys" in anticipation of their submission.

Clenching his teeth, Young Master Feng declared, "Done! Thank you for your assistance, Ms. Ganbili. What should I do next?"

Ganbili smiled with satisfaction. "Honesty benefits us both—I receive commissions for such transactions. Simply transfer two hundred million to this account," she said, handing him a card bearing an unusual eight-digit number. "Then wait comfortably at home. The Celestial Consortium handles matters... discreetly."

Upon returning to the Feng Estate, Young Master Feng consulted the family patriarch. Though initially opposed due to the exorbitant cost, the patriarch eventually relented under his son's insistence. After days of financial maneuvering, the Feng family transferred the staggering sum.

Ecstatic, Young Master Feng spent the night reveling in his favorite chamber, daydreaming of possessing Guan Yu's women—Lü Mei, Zhang Han, and others—while dispatching spies to monitor his target. He slept clutching his new "toys," imagining them as the captured beauties.

Weeks passed without action from the Celestial Consortium. Guan Yu continued living unperturbed, monitored yet unharmed. Frustrated, Young Master Feng confronted Ganbili: "Why hasn't Guan Yu been eliminated yet?"

Ganbili sighed dramatically. "Our top-tier assassins refuse this paltry sum. Transfer another fifty million to appease them, and I guarantee completion within three days."

The additional payment drained the Feng coffers, reducing their meals from lavish feasts to pickled radishes. Five days later, a haggard Young Master Feng—hair half-grayed—discovered Ganbili had vanished. Investigations revealed her as a notorious swindler who'd duped multiple families with false consortium connections.

The Feng patriarch collapsed from shock, while Young Master Feng aged decades overnight, muttering "Deceiver..." endlessly. His sister Feng Xihu (West Lake) shouldered the family's crumbling enterprises. Though their financial foundation remained solid, the humiliation cut deep.

Transformed by adversity, Feng Xihu abandoned her former fiery temperament for steely composure. One evening, she sought Guan Yu at the Night Blossom Club.

Guan Yu rose as she approached. "May we speak?" she asked, her voice devoid of its former vigor.

"Of course." He gestured to a seat.

Over juice served across a glass table, Feng Xihu stated flatly: "Let this feud end. The Fengs have suffered enough."

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. "Your family's downfall stems from your brother's choices, not mine."

"Don't play innocent." Her gaze sharpened. "Ganbili was your plant—you orchestrated that two-hundred-fifty-million fraud."

A wry smile touched Guan Yu's lips. "Nothing escapes your discernment, Miss Feng. When your brother sought elite assassins, I merely... redirected his efforts. How did you deduce this?"

"Only you would dare orchestrate such an audacious scheme." Her voice quivered slightly. "I came hoping for mercy, but see only ruthlessness."

Guan Yu's expression hardened. "Self-preservation compelled me. Had your brother succeeded, I'd be dead."

Tears glimmered in Feng Xihu's eyes as conflicting loyalties warred within her—familial duty versus unspoken affection. Rising abruptly, she warned: "With me leading the Fengs now, you'll find no easy victories."

Guan Yu watched her departure, the ghost of her tear-streaked face lingering. "Another round, Lao Hou," he called to the bartender, masking unease.

Unbeknownst to him, Feng Xihu's transformation birthed a formidable adversary. The Feng patriarch and heir's "illnesses" were strategic theatrics, buying time to regroup. Behind closed doors, plans unfolded to dismantle Guan Yu's empire—a counterstroke fueled by betrayed affection and familial honor.

As Feng Xihu walked into the night, resolve hardened her heart. The game had merely entered a new phase, where love and vengeance danced their deadly waltz.
