“But when Jiu Buyun saw Xiao Bai, she realized she didn’t recognize this person at all. Judging by his monk’s robes, the situation inside must be dire. It seemed today’s plan had failed. A look of despair flickered across Jiu Buyun’s face.

“Shengsheng, are you alright?” Xiao Bai called out as he rushed forward to check the injuries. His own face was pale, clearly wounded as well.

True to her reputation as a First-Class Zun Master, Shengsheng had been incapacitated by a single devastating blow from Jiu Buyun. The searing pain in his abdomen still lingered, leaving him unable to stand.

“I’ll live,” Shengsheng forced out, “but the injuries are severe. I’ll need time to recover.” He quickly added, “Is everyone else safe?” His eyes fell on Xiao Bai’s tattered clothes and fresh wounds.

Xiao Bai nodded. “Thanks to Guanyu’s timely reinforcements, the attackers have been subdued. The situation’s under control now. Only Big Beard’s injuries are serious. Brother Youguang and I are fine.”

Shengsheng exhaled in relief, his tension easing. “Thank heavens everyone’s safe. That’s what matters.”

“Let me help you inside,” Xiao Bai urged. “You need to regulate your internal energy to heal.”

Shengsheng nodded weakly. Without support, he couldn’t move an inch. The slightest movement worsened the agony in his gut—likely internal damage from Jiu Buyun’s strike.

As Xiao Bai gently lifted him, Shengsheng broke into a cold sweat. Beads of moisture streamed down his ashen face. Suddenly, a metallic taste flooded his throat. “Pfft—” A spray of crimson erupted from his lips.

Shengsheng collapsed against Xiao Bai, who gasped in alarm. “Are you alright?!”

“Just…get me back…quickly,” Shengsheng rasped through gritted teeth.

Realizing urgency, Xiao Bai hoisted him piggyback. At that moment, engine roars echoed from below. Both Xiao Bai and Jiu Buyun tensed—whose forces were arriving now?

If Bill Lin brought fresh troops, their fragile victory would crumble. Only Second-to-Wolf remained combat-ready, having caught their leader off-guard. Another assault now would spell disaster.

Peering past parked vehicles, Xiao Bai spotted a powerful engine’s roar materialize into Guanyu’s iconic Da Hang vehicle screeching to a halt.

Guanyu and Xue Jing emerged urgently. “Don’t linger here—get him inside!” Guanyu ordered, noting Shengsheng’s internal injuries.

As Xiao Bai rushed off, Xue Jing’s gaze fell on Jiu Buyun slumped against a wall. Her shattered arm told its own story—a wound only Second-to-Wolf could inflict.

Inside the temple, Second-to-Wolf kept his blade pressed against Yuan Shanding’s throat, arms trembling from prolonged strain. The Second-Class Zun Master knelt obediently, any escape attempt suicidal.

When Guanyu arrived, Second-to-Wolf quipped, “Took you long enough!” His dark humor eased tensions—their comrades were safe.

“We’ll cuff him to the stone lion,” Guanyu decided, tossing handcuffs. Second-to-Wolf marveled, “Convenient gadgets! Should get myself some.”

Yuan Shanding’s defiance crumbled when threatened with Jiu Buyun’s deteriorating condition. “Spare her! I’ll talk!” he bargained desperately.

Meanwhile, inside, Youguang stitched Big Beard’s wounds sans anesthesia. The mountain of a man chuckled through gritted teeth: “Scratches…heal in days.”

Guanyu’s guilt deepened seeing the human pincushion. “Let Xue Jing assist—”

“No need!” Big Beard yelped, flinching. “Wouldn’t…trouble sister-in-law…”

As Guanyu turned to check Shengsheng, Xiao Bai cautioned, “Let him meditate. Internal injuries need quiet.”

Outside, Guanyu confronted Yuan Shanding. “Your name. Rank.”

The captive sneered, “Why should I—”

Guanyu cut him off. “That woman outside bleeds out as we speak. Cooperate, and she lives.”

Yuan Shanding’s bravado shattered. “Save her! I’ll tell everything!”

Thus the fragile truce held—a wounded eagle bargaining for his mate’s life, while temple shadows lengthened over bloodied warriors and uneasy peace.
