Wang Xiaorong turned to Guan Yu and said, “Let’s go prepare for dinner. Don’t pay them any mind. Whatever they say, just pretend you didn’t hear it.”

Though she could afford such nonchalance, Guan Yu couldn’t. If the Red Lotus Sect spread rumors claiming they’d colluded with a demonic sect’s witch to steal the Jade Bagua, the Cloud Azure Sect’s reputation would be ruined, and it would bring trouble to their sect leader.

Guan Yu declared, “Yue Jing, I’ve already told you—we searched for the Jade Bagua but couldn’t find it. You can’t blame me for that. This matter has nothing to do with her. Watch your words—showing some decency won’t harm you.”

“Since when do I need your lecturing?” Yue Jing sneered, pointing at Xiao Zhi and A’ze. “Consorting with a demonic sect’s witch? Seems your Cloud Azure Sect planned this all along!”

**Chapter 3,430: Bullying the Weak with Numbers (Part 1)**

“You lot—confess now! Have you betrayed the Cloud Azure Sect to become spies for the demonic sect?” Lai Lixia chimed in.

Yue Jing’s group clearly outnumbered Guan Yu’s side by nearly two-to-one, with more Red Lotus disciples waiting downstairs. Confident in their overwhelming advantage, Yue Jing had no intention of letting Guan Yu off easily.

Earlier, he’d believed Guan Yu might help locate the Jade Bagua. Now, seeing him entangled with a demonic witch, he concluded Guan Yu was no righteous man.

Guan Yu detested dealing with such petty characters. “Mongrels always bark loudest behind others’ backs. Even if you toss them a bone, they’ll never show gratitude. Let’s just go eat.”

“Halt!” Lai Lixia blocked their path. “Innkeeper! We requested a room exchange ages ago because our private chamber was too small. Why hasn’t it been arranged? Are the rest of us supposed to eat standing? You claimed no rooms were available earlier—why did they get one immediately?”

The flustered innkeeper explained, “Madam, you see, the guests in Room Seven just vacated as these patrons arrived. If a larger room opens up, I’ll switch you immediately—”

“No! We’re taking this room!” Yue Jing roared. “They’ve only four people—they can have our smaller chamber. Our larger group deserves the bigger space!”

As Yue Jing waved his followers toward Room Seven, Wang Xiaorong blocked their way, hands on hips. “Have you no shame? This room is ours! Do rabid dogs now snatch possessions too?”

“Demoness! Don’t test my patience!” Yue Jing spat. “Move aside now, or even Guan Yu’s protection won’t save you from punishment!”

“With these shrimp soldiers and crab generals?” Wang Xiaorong laughed mockingly. “I wouldn’t fear the Red Lotus Sect’s dregs if your sect leader himself came, I might show caution. But you lot? You’re barely human in my eyes!”

Her brazen insults ignited Yue Jing’s fury. Though they’d clashed before, today’s numerical superiority emboldened him. “Such arrogance! Lixia, summon the rest of our people upstairs!”

Guan Yu chuckled coldly. The shamelessness astounded him—already seven or eight against one, yet they called for reinforcements to bully a girl.

Wang Xiaorong taunted, “What’s wrong? Scared? Resorting to numbers? So-called righteous factions only excel at ganging up on the vulnerable!”

“Demonic scum deserve no mercy!” Yue Jing retorted. “Today, I’ll capture you for interrogation about your sect’s schemes!”

Guan Yu grew uneasy. If fighting erupted and he intervened, the Red Lotus Sect would blame them entirely. Yet abandoning Wang Xiaorong after her crucial help at Blackblood Ridge felt dishonorable.

Xiao Zhi tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve, whispering urgently, “If they fight, you must assist! Otherwise, we’ll commit grave wrongdoing!”

Guan Yu knew his nature wouldn’t permit neutrality. “Yue Jing, rather than hunting the crucial Jade Bagua, you squabble over dining rooms? Seems you care little for your mission.”

In truth, Guan Yu had carried the Jade Bagua earlier but secretly placed it on Lord Men during their Echo Tower visit.

“Worry about yourself, Guan Yu!” Yue Jing sneered. “After today, all will know of your demonic collusion. Let’s see how you explain that to your sect!”

“Amusing. If I feared consequences, I wouldn’t act. Do you think such trifles concern me?” Guan Yu shrugged.

Realizing accusations were inevitable regardless of action, Guan Yu scoffed, “The Red Lotus Sect’s prestige shines bright—needing dozens to subdue one girl! Most impressive!”

As Lai Lixia summoned remaining disciples, Wang Xiaorong clapped mockingly. “Even a hundred more wouldn’t suffice for warm-up exercises! This space is cramped—let’s fight outside!”

She backflipped over the railing, leaping to the street below. “Stop her escape!” Yue Jing shouted, charging after.

Outside, Wang Xiaorong produced a bamboo tube. Breaking its seal, she launched a brilliant white flare skyward—a magical signal obvious to all.

When Yue Jing’s group surrounded her outside, Guan Yu pretended nonchalance: “Younger Brother Yue resembles a snowman! Perhaps you should bathe before embarrassing yourselves further?”

“Who scattered this damned flour?!” Yue Jing bellowed, coated white from Guan Yu’s overturned vendor stall.

As chaos reigned, Wang Xiaorong danced through attackers, skillfully evading stronger opponents while picking off weaker disciples. Despite numerical disadvantage, her eclectic training from multiple demonic mentors proved surprisingly effective.

When Yue Jing hypocritically demanded Guan Yu’s assistance against the “demonic witch,” Guan Yu joined the fray—ostensibly helping but actually disrupting Red Lotus formations.

“Are you aiding or hindering?!” Yue Jing roared as Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong’s “battle” resembled partnered dancing more than combat.

“You criticized my neutrality, now complain about my involvement?” Guan Yu retorted dramatically. “This demoness’s skills overwhelm me! Hurry and assist!”

As Red Lotus disciples massed for another assault, sudden clashing steel announced arrivals—demonic reinforcements led by a black-clad Left Emissary effortlessly dispersed the attackers.

**Chapter 3,431: Bullying the Weak with Numbers (Part 2)**

“Apologies for my tardiness, Young Mistress,” the Left Emissary bowed to Wang Xiaorong.

“No matter—Guan Yu protected me,” she grinned, gesturing at him.

The emissary turned icy eyes on the Red Lotus group. “Scram before we collect your corpses.”

Yue Jing scrambled away, shouting threats: “This isn’t over, Guan Yu! We’ll settle accounts later!”

Observing the retreat, Guan Yu realized orthodox sects besides Cloud Azure lacked true prowess. Containing the demonic threat might require more than conventional methods.

“Young Mistress,” the emissary addressed Wang Xiaorong, “the Demon Lord requests your return.”

“No! I just arrived in Qujiang City! Father promised me this mission!” she protested.

As Guan Yu attempted to leave, Wang Xiaorong blocked him. “Where are you going?”

“With your protection secured, I’ve matters to attend.”

The Left Emissary interjected politely, “The Demon Lord extends an invitation, Young Master Guan. He wishes to express gratitude for aiding our Young Mistress.”

Wang Xiaorong added enticingly, “Father doesn’t bite! Come visit—if only to learn the way!”

The suggestion struck a chord. Knowing the demonic stronghold’s location could prove strategically valuable.

“I’ve pressing business now,” Guan Yu temporized. “Perhaps in a few days?”

“The Demon Soul Sect’s path will remain open for your honored visit,” the emissary acquiesced.

**Chapter 3,432: The Invitation**

As the demonic entourage departed, Guan Yu contemplated the implications. This invitation might unveil critical intelligence—or entangle him in dangerous politics. Either way, the game’s stakes had just escalated.
