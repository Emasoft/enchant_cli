“Hmm, I think everything should have a rationale,” Guan Yu said, suppressing a smirk to avoid revealing his cunning. After a moment’s thought, he continued, “For instance, standing up for my girlfriend gives me solid justification. If we follow ancient traditions, this would be a heroic rescue leading to the beauty pledging herself in marriage!”

Li Xi nodded slightly.

Guan Yu’s heart leapt. Did this mean she approved of his idea? If so, wouldn’t he effortlessly win the beauty’s heart? Add another stunning beauty to his harem?

He cared little about domestic strife, adhering to the principle that one more beauty—especially a goddess-like figure like this—was always welcome. He could already imagine himself grinning under the covers.

However, all this remained mere fantasy, wild imagination bordering on delusion.

Li Xi’s next words shattered his illusions.

With another slight nod, she said softly, “Your intentions are good. I support them... but don’t approve.”

Guan Yu nearly choked on frustration. What kind of half-hearted approval was this? Pure nonsense!

Seeing his sullen expression, Li Xi’s lips curled into an enigmatic smile. “As your partner, our fates are intertwined. Is that justification sufficient?”

Guan Yu had to admit the terrifying cunning of intelligent women. His attempt to gain advantage had backfired spectacularly.

Waving impatiently at the waiting attendant, he declared, “Sun Mande, right? Today I’ll make him spit out his teeth!”

The attendant, well-trained in discretion, remained silent despite Guan Yu’s provocations. She led them quietly to a secluded private room.

Li Xi followed for two reasons: avoiding direct conflict with Sun Mande, and curiosity about Guan Yu’s audacity to challenge established Beijing factions without connections.

Guan Yu knew he’d become Li Xi’s pawn again. Yet unlike previous times when he’d gained some advantage, this promised nothing but trouble.

Frustrated, he kicked open the private room door with a thunderous crash.

The jovial atmosphere inside froze as all eyes turned to the intruder. Guan Yu puffed out his chest, whispering smugly to Li Xi, “Impressive, eh? Scared them all!”

Li曦 rolled her eyes at his barbaric entrance but secretly approved—sometimes brute force made statements words couldn’t.

Surveying the room, Guan Yu smirked. “Having such a merry feast? Why stir trouble then?”

Sun Mande’s face darkened. “You’re the troublemaker! Who are you?”

“I’m here for Sun Mande. Let the coward face me!” Guan Yu sneered.

“I AM Sun Mande!” the man roared.

Guan Yu feigned surprise. “You? This pathetic excuse beats me? Just a pretentious clown!”

The insult snapped Sun Mande’s restraint. He turned to Li曦, snarling, “Is this your answer?”

Li曦 remained calm. “The Li family treats all guests equally.”

The standoff escalated. Sun Mande threatened to poach Li家族’s prized appraiser to rival Zheng Corporation. Li曦 paled—this could shatter industry balance.

Seeing her reaction, Sun Mande smirked. “Mistakes demand consequences. For you, that means submitting to me.”

Guan宇 interjected, “What consequences?”

“Making you search for teeth on the ground!” Sun Mande spat.

Chaos erupted. Before Sun Mande finished speaking, Guan Yu’s fist connected with his face—once, twice. Bone cracked as Sun Mande collapsed, howling, blood and teeth spraying.

True to his word, Guan Yu left Sun Mande literally “searching for teeth on the ground.” The room fell silent, witnessing justice served with brutal efficiency.
