“It’s fine.” Guan Yu, never one to be petty, replied with easy confidence.

After exchanging polite greetings with Qiangzi, Guan Yu and Niu Le entered the nightclub. Though the night’s festivities hadn’t yet begun, scattered patrons already lounged in dimly lit corners.

“Oh, handsome, first time here? Let this *jie-jie* keep you company,” a sultry voice purred the moment they settled into the VIP booth Luo Cheng had arranged. Guan Yu initially ignored it but couldn’t resist glancing over.

His heart lurched violently, breath catching in his throat.

Though he’d seen countless beauties in recent months, the woman before him was unquestionably the most bewitching creature he’d ever encountered. He hadn’t imagined a human could exude such otherworldly allure.

Her delicate, heart-shaped face framed phoenix eyes upturned like hooks, lashes impossibly long, crimson lips parted as if inviting conquest. A black strapless gown clung to her sinuous curves, the neckline straining against a voluptuous bust that threatened to spill free. Raven waves cascaded to her wasp waist, swaying hypnotically to the music’s rhythm. The scandalously short skirt rode higher with each movement, teasing glimpses of what lay beneath.

Guan Yu swallowed thickly, mouth gone dry. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Niu Le openly gaping, drool trailing unnoticed down his chin.

Reassessing the vision before him, Guan Yu conceded inwardly: such a woman could enthrall any man.

The beauty basked in their stares, tilting her chin proudly as though accustomed to worship. When Guan Yu’s gaze returned to her, she smiled knowingly, sipping blood-red liquid from her champagne flute. He tracked the wine’s descent down her slender throat, transfixed.

A pink tongue darted out to capture stray droplets from her lips.

Guan Yu jerked his face away, lungs burning from held breath. *Damn, she’s a succubus.*

He’d heard legends of women whose every movement ensnared men’s souls. Now he believed them.

Unfazed by the surrounding stares, the enchantress approached. Jade fingers lifted Guan Yu’chin, her lush curves pressing against him as she breathed, “Am I not beautiful?”

Her unbound softness crushed against his chest sent blood roaring to his head. Through thin fabric, he made a startling realization - she wore no bra.

“Why look away?” she pouted, feigning hurt. “Do I displease you?”

“N-no… you’re stunning,” he stammered, dazed.

Her tinkling laughter released him. Only then did Guan Yu gasp for air, understanding how emperors had ruined kingdoms for such temptations. *Worth every lost throne.*

“Wen Qing,” she murmured. “Your name?”

“G-Guan Yu.”

“Guan Yu?” Her laugh chimed like silver bells. “Where’s your Yu Ji then?”

“Yu Ji?” He blinked, confused.

“Fool! The Hegemon-King’s farewell to his concubine!” She tilted her head, as if lecturing a child.

His eye twitched. “That was Xiang Yu, the Chu Hegemon. Not Guan Yu.”

“Xiang Yu, Guan Yu - same difference~” She counted syllables on slender fingers, the childish gesture absurdly charming on such a vixen.

*Completely different!* He screamed internally.

Seizing her hand, Guan Yu traced characters on her palm. “It’s the ‘Yu’ from ‘cosmos,’ not ‘feather.’”

Warmth flooded Wen Qing’s cheeks at his calloused touch. “Cosmic Yu… will you conquer the universe?” she teased, masking embarrassment with flirtation.

“The universe?” He chuckled. “Never considered it.” The ancient coin’s power had only fueled fights and finances, not cosmic ambitions.

“Idiot…” Her retort melted into the DJ’s sudden bass drop as the club erupted in neon chaos.

“Yu-ge!” Luo Cheng’s shout pierced the noise. “Why didn’t you tell us you were back? We’d have met your flight!”

“Troubling you wasn’t necessary.” Guan Yu rose, clapping his friend’s shoulder. “Came straight here, didn’t I?”

Luo Cheng’s gaze locked on Wen Qing. “And… this is?”

“A frien—”

“I’m A-Yu’s girlfriend,” Wen Qing interjected sweetly, demeanor shifting to demure charm.

“S-sis-in-law!” Luo Cheng stammered.

Wen Qing’s delighted laughter clashed with Guan Yu’s bewilderment. *Since when did I get such luck? Does the ancient coin attract peach blossoms too?*

As Guan Yu ordered drinks, Wen Qing requested triple his amount. He sighed - wooing beauties indeed burned cash. Observing other patrons chasing girls, he pitied their wallets.

“Hey rookie!” snarled a suited thug barging into their booth. “This spot’s reserved for our boss!”

A porcine man in white suit leered at Wen Qing. Guan Yu arched a brow. *Do we look like easy targets?*

“No reservation signs when we arrived,” he said mildly.

“The fuck you deaf?!” The lackey barked.

Niu Le lunged, fist cocked. “Who you callin’ rookie?!”

“Wait!” Qiangzi shoved through the crowd, panting. He slapped the fat boss. “Blind mutt! This is Yu-ge’s seat!”

Turning obsequious, Qiangzi bowed. “Yu-ge, forgive this idiot. Want his fingers as apology?”

“Spare me your collections,” Guan Yu dismissed. The gang scrambled away.

As night deepened, rivers of alcohol flowed. Guan Yu stood on the table, chugging Munich beer. “Drink till we drop!”

“You steal all campus hotties, now this?!” Niu Le slurred. “But I’ll outdrink you!”

Luo Cheng raised a glass. “To Yu-ge!”

The world blurred into bass-thumping haze. Guan Yu’s last coherent memory was being enveloped in feminine fragrance, drowning willingly...

He awoke to Wen Qing’s face inches from his, her curves pressed against him. “Enjoy last night?” she purred.

Scenes flooded back - the hotel room, her dress pooling on white carpet, frenzied coupling. Guan Yu flushed scarlet, scrambling back.

“So fierce yesterday, so shy today?” Her laugh trilled as she traced his chest. “Want an encore?”

When her hand dipped lower, Guan Yu groaned. This succubus would be his undoing.
