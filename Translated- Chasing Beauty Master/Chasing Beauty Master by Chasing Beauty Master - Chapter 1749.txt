“Why set off at this hour? No one's properly rested yet. Waking everyone so early will leave us all exhausted,” Guan Yu complained again, suspecting Xiao Mei might be deliberately causing trouble.

If this were truly malicious mischief or lacked convincing justification, Guan Yu would absolutely refuse to depart now. Proper rest during resting hours ensured energy for travel. If everyone remained drowsy, they'd be ill-prepared for dangers ahead. Facing major troubles while fatigued would prove disastrous.

“You’re such a nag,” Xiao Mei retorted, pointing skyward. “Can’t an intelligent man see the obvious? This cool dawn offers perfect travel conditions. Only fools would march under noon’s scorching sun!”

Guan Yu considered her words. The pale morning light allowed clear visibility. Though chilly, the crisp air made for pleasant journeying.

Understanding dawned as their companions stirred – particularly Wang Jun, who swallowed his curses upon seeing Guan Yu.

“Great Leader,” Guan Yu pressed, “Are you suggesting we travel now, rest during midday heat, then resume in cooler afternoon?”

This method wasn’t unfamiliar. In Huaxia summers, farmers followed similar patterns – avoiding unbearable noon temperatures by working dawn and late afternoon.

Before Xiao Mei could answer, Guan Yu continued, “Very well. This seems wise. Everyone – prepare to depart!”

As orders circulated, Guan Yu chided himself for not considering this earlier. No wonder Xiao Mei had retired early last night – she’d planned this dawn departure all along. Yet she’d kept silent, leaving Guan Yu, Siqi, and others to late rest. What a schemer!

**Chapter 4575: Conflict**

Had they known yesterday, all would have retired early. Now groggy companions gathered supplies. Though winds still blew cold, this remained preferable to midday’s blistering heat.

Addressing the assembled group, Guan Yu announced, “Our early departure stems from the Great Leader’s wisdom. Why we weren’t informed earlier? That remains unclear. Like you, I’m exhausted – but we must endure.”

His words deliberately redirected resentment toward Xiao Mei. Unfazed, she declared, “This benefits everyone! When we rest comfortably during noon’s furnace heat, you’ll appreciate this sacrifice.”

As the caravan formed, Xiao Mei led on camelback, her navigation method still mysterious to Guan Yu. He considered inquiring, but knew she’d withhold answers. Their only hope lay in following her lead.

The procession crawled across dunes until dawn brightened fully. “Look there – people!” Xiao Mei called from a high crest.

A kilometer ahead sprawled thirty-odd tents. “Shall we investigate or detour?” Guan Yu asked.

Xiao Mei’s laugh held warning. “Those seek Miao City too – likely martial factions. Approach risks conflict. The choice is yours.”

Guan Yu weighed options. The camp’s doubled numbers suggested danger. “We’ll detour. Conserve strength for Miao City’s trials.”

The group arced wide, maintaining distance. Both parties observed warily – neither initiating contact. In these lawless sands, prudence outweighed aggression.

**Chapter 4576: Not Worth It**

Wang Jun gaped. “A hundred warriors! Had we attacked...”

“We’d be crushed,” Azhe finished grimly. “What faction fields such numbers?”

Guan Yu pondered. Numbers mattered little if they couldn’t locate Miao City. Current avoidance ensured safety. By midday’s furnace heat, they’d outpaced the larger group.

“There!” Xiao Mei indicated a massive dune’s shaded lee. “We’ll rest there.”

Guan Yu objected, “Avalanche risk! Higher ground’s safer despite heat.”

“Suit yourselves,” Xiao Mei shrugged, riding toward the shade. “Buried? I’ll dig out easily – you won’t.”

The main group pitched tents on open high ground. Guan Yu organized rotating sentries, beginning with Wang Jun. All slept fitfully until shouts erupted: “Guan Yu! Riders approach!”

Northern horizon dust revealed approaching figures. “Wake everyone!” Guan Yu ordered. To Siqi he said, “Time for disguise.”

Emerging later, Guan Yu had transformed – a grizzled, stooped elder unrecognizable even to his companion.

**Chapter 4577: Hold Fast**

The approaching party advanced through afternoon’s worst heat. Guan Yu’s group, refreshed but wary, prepared for confrontation. Non-aggression didn’t mean weakness.

“Siqi,” the disguised Guan Yu murmured, “Remember – we don’t start fights. But we finish them.”

As the strangers neared, tension crackled like desert static. Miao City’s promise drew predators and prey alike into nature’s crucible. Survival now depended on wit, will, and weathered resolve.
