For instance, take Siqi. Her spells are somewhat different from others’ because they predominantly incorporate wind-based elements. Guanyu mused that while everyone receives the same cultivation mantras, the final manifestation of one’s abilities ultimately depends on individual comprehension.

Now, Guanyu found himself puzzled. Where had the artifact spirit within the Imperial Seal vanished? Previously, this space had been shrouded in mist, obscuring all vision. He hadn’t even realized it resembled a sealed chamber. Yet this time, the artifact spirit’s absence left him bewildered. What exactly was happening here?

“My dear master, when did you arrive? I didn’t even notice…” Suddenly, a voice echoed from an indeterminable direction. Thick fog coalesced before Guanyu, forming the spectral head of a monstrous creature floating midair.

Though the colossal head was composed of mist, Guanyu could still perceive the intensity of its gaze upon him.

“My mighty master, your power has grown tremendously. I failed to detect your entry this time.” The artifact spirit studied Guanyu curiously. “Wait—this isn’t your consciousness entering. It’s your *soul*!”

By the end, the spirit’s tone brimmed with astonishment. Guanyu, unaware of how he’d entered, felt no discernible difference.

“I thought you’d disappeared,” Guanyu said. “When I first arrived, I couldn’t find you. Though this space is vast, where were you hiding?”

“I am formless—an intangible entity. I manifest when you desire to see me and vanish when you don’t. The moisture in the air constitutes my essence,” the spirit explained.

“But my illustrious master, how have you entered the artifact’s realm with your soul? Have you reached the Dharma Immortal realm? So soon?” it pressed.

Guanyu frowned. “Dharma Immortal realm? I’ve never heard of it. Explain.”

The spirit scrutinized Guanyu’s dual cultivation of magic and martial arts. Though his spiritual pool and inner energy core had expanded significantly, they remained far from the oceanic vastness characteristic of a Dharma Immortal’s reserves.

This defied logic. Ordinarily, only a wisp of consciousness could communicate with an artifact spirit. Full soul projection required Dharma Immortal mastery—a feat akin to soul transcendence. Yet here Guanyu stood, his entire soul present despite lacking the requisite cultivation.

“Clearly, you haven’t attained that realm. How is this possible?” the spirit pondered. Normally, the Imperial Seal would alert it to any consciousness attempting entry, filtering out unauthorized intruders. A Dharma Immortal’s soul could bypass these safeguards, but Guanyu’s presence here while the spirit slumbered defied explanation.

Moreover, while ordinary cultivators couldn’t wield the Imperial Seal, a Dharma Immortal could sever its original bond and claim ownership through soul infiltration—a capability Guanyu shouldn’t possess.

“I don’t know,” Guanyu admitted. “I was riding my horse when I suddenly entered this state. My senses amplified—even with closed eyes, I perceive the dark surroundings acutely. Internal changes occurred too, hence my need to consult you.”

The ancient spirit deliberated before responding: “You’ve entered an Elevated Cultivation State—a rare condition where one’s latent potential erupts, exponentially boosting progress. Most cultivators dream of this, yet you seek to exit? Unprecedented!”

It continued: “This state arises from perfect alignment of circumstances. Though fleeting, its benefits are monumental. That you maintain dialogue within it astonishes me. Your prolonged trance suggests boundless potential.”

Rather than rejoice, Guanyu frowned. “But the seal in my mind grows restless. If it breaks loose…”

“Chapter 4206: Holding Nothing Back, Speaking Without Reserve”

“I cannot assist with that danger,” the spirit stated. “Your rapid advancement provokes the seal. Avoid confrontation, and it may remain dormant.”

Guanyu marveled at the spirit’s wisdom—a timeless entity indeed. “How do I exit this state? I can’t risk the seal destabilizing.”

“Most crave this opportunity, yet you seek escape? I cannot say. Perhaps await its natural conclusion.”

“Wait? If the seal erupts, I’m powerless!” Guanyu protested, though acknowledging the benefits—his expanding spiritual pool and energy core promised future mastery if sustained.

The spirit reassured: “The seal’s purpose is control through suppression, not harm. It won’t endanger you recklessly.”

Changing tack, Guanyu asked: “Where do you dwell here normally? I detected no traces earlier.”

“I merge with the walls. But I must commend your acquisition of that formidable cultivation method. Its mysteries have consumed me—I’ve barely deciphered the first five lines.”

Guanyu chuckled. “So you secretly study here? Impressive.”

“Unusual arts fascinate me. This technique’s power and peculiarity demand investigation,” the spirit admitted. “After prolonged study, I’ve uncovered its secrets.”

Eyes lighting up, Guanyu pressed: “Share your findings! If I assimilate this Eight-Sided Drum Art, perhaps it could weaken the seal.”

“Chapter 4207: Hazy Recollections”

“Impossible,” the spirit deflated his hopes. “This incomplete dark art’s fourth fragment—not the first—lacks foundational principles. Forced absorption invites backlash. Your current cultivation cannot tame it.”

Guanyu’s excitement waned. “But it resided in me before without harm.”

“The seal restrained it then. Proper cultivation requires sequential mastery from the first fragment. This final portion’s dark nature clashes with your current path.”

Perplexed, Guanyu countered: “I thought this was the first fragment!”

“My first master created the supreme Great Mirror Art,” the spirit reminisced. “Compared to that, even the Eight-Sided Drum pales. But centuries have passed—the Great Mirror Art may be lost.”

Guanyu’s curiosity ignited. “Your first master? Who was he?”

“A transcendent being who defeated me—then a beast realm prince rampaging through the mortal world. He forged the Imperial Seal to imprison me as its spirit. How long ago? Even my memories blur…”

Stunned, Guanyu realized the artifact’s origin as a prison for this primordial entity. “Do you wish freedom? Perhaps I could release you.”

The offer masked calculation—unleashing this ancient power could prove advantageous. Yet the spirit’s response hung in the mist-shrouded air, its massive eyes swirling with untold epochs of wisdom.
