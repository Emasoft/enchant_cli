“Jinhua was somewhat puzzled and increasingly curious. She asked, ‘Then why did you say earlier that Feng Xihu set a trap to imprison you, yet she personally let you out? Did something happen between you when you hid in her room?’

Guanyu gave her an odd look, gently tapped her petite nose, and chuckled, ‘Little rascal, stop imagining things. What could possibly have happened? There’s absolutely nothing between us. Don’t you know my character by now?’

‘Hehe, of course I trust you,’ Jinhua replied playfully. She had merely been teasing him. She knew Feng Xihu had been obsessively pursuing Guanyu, but he’d never given her an opening. Though Guanyu had many wives, he was a man of principles.

‘Good. You imp,’ Guanyu said, aware of her jest. After a moment of banter, he turned serious. ‘Jinhua, you’re an expert in poisons. Do you understand snake venom?’

Guanyu remained worried about Elder Qing’s condition. Having sparred with Jinhua and knowing her proficiency with toxins, he hoped she might offer insight.

‘Snake venom? Are you asking for Ling’er’s sake?’ Jinhua teased.

‘Yes. After the last venom flare-up, Elder Qing has remained unconscious. It seems... he doesn’t have much time left,’ Guanyu said sorrowfully.

He had previously discussed Ling’er’s family situation with Jinhua. She explained, ‘Snake venoms vary widely. The deadliest are the coldest and cruelest, killing victims instantly within two seconds.

But in Elder Qing’s case, the specifics are unclear. The venom has lingered too long, and his body is saturated with conflicting toxins from years of consuming snake gallbladders.

Over time, using venom to combat venom has allowed toxicity to permeate his organs. Even if Hua Tuo himself were reborn, he couldn’t save him now.’

Guanyu’s expression darkened with despair, yet he persisted, ‘No—Elder Qing used his lifelong cultivation to shield his heart meridian, preventing the venom’s invasion. He’s held on all these years hoping for a cure.

But days ago, an assassin forced him to expend his energy defending himself. The venom overwhelmed his heart afterward.’

Jinhua furrowed her brow in contemplation. After a pause, she declared, ‘Then there might still be a solution.’

‘What solution?’ Guanyu leaned forward urgently.

‘If the venom only recently breached his heart meridian and he hasn’t died instantly, it suggests the toxin isn’t among the most lethal. His coma likely stems from channeling his final energy to preserve his last breath—much like the Yang Family Patriarch years ago.’

Guanyu’s eyes lit up. ‘Of course! Elder Qing must have used his remaining strength to protect his heart after the venom struck. But how do we save him now?’

‘Unless,’ Jinhua mused, ‘you possess another Jiezun Sheli relic, like the one that revived the Yang Patriarch.’

Guanyu groaned. ‘There was only one Jiezun Sheli. I can’t manufacture them!’

‘Alternatively,’ Jinhua said mysteriously, ‘find one specific person.’

‘Who? Where? I’ll track them down!’

‘I don’t know her whereabouts myself, or I’d have told you.’ Jinhua bit into a banana. ‘Only my grandmaster, Hua Zi—full name Cang Huazi—can neutralize this venom. She’s the world’s foremost authority.’

‘Your grandmaster? Is her antidote mastery renowned?’ Guanyu asked, surprised this was his first hearing of her.

‘Naturally. As the progenitor of poison arts, mastery of toxins requires equal skill in antidotes,’ Jinhua said proudly.

‘Where is she now?’

‘Uncertain. Perhaps somewhere in the Western nations.’

Guanyu frowned. ‘The West has countless countries! How can we search without leads?’

‘Provide specifics—distinct traits, preferences?’ he pressed.

‘She’s a beauty. I only saw her once during my initiation, when she mentioned weariness of Eastern life and desire to relocate West. Finding her is our only hope.’

‘We’ll find her,’ Guanyu vowed. ‘Even if she dwells in heaven, I’ll bring her down!’

Moved by his resolve, Jinhua decided, ‘I’ll accompany you. She won’t receive strangers.’

‘Excellent! You’ll earn grand rewards,’ Guanyu said, embracing her.

‘Let’s depart swiftly. My cultivation has stagnated—I need her guidance anyway,’ Jinhua affirmed.

‘Why not consult your master instead?’ Guanyu teased.

‘Have you forgotten? My master died years ago,’ Jinhua chided.

Recollecting dimly, Guanyu nodded. ‘We’ll prepare to leave in two days. I’ll gather intelligence first.’

Days later, after exhausting Huayu Group’s resources for scant clues, Guanyu declared, ‘We start in Mei Country.’

Post-preparations, they arrived at a Western airport. The foreign environment disoriented Jinhua, but Guanyu had arranged a leased villa—modest yet tidy despite a year’s vacancy.

‘Guanyu! See how I’ve cleaned!’ Jinhua called from the second floor.

The spotless villa gleamed under her efforts. After meals and rest, they adjusted to the time zone. Days later, their first outing became a shopping trip.

At a sprawling self-service mall, Jinhua selected matching black sportswear. ‘Try this!’ she insisted, donning a white cap. The couple’s outfits drew glances as they explored.

‘Returning him means sending him back to traffickers,’ Guanyu reasoned. To the boy, he vowed, ‘Follow us, and you’ll never steal again. I guarantee safety and prosperity.’

Jinhua backed him: ‘This is fortune’s turn. No more beatings or thefts.’

Trembling, the boy whispered, ‘Truth? Not another trick? You won’t take me to police?’」
