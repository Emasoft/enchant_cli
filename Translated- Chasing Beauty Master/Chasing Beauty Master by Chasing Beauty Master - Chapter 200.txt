Shortly after Guan Yu successfully rescued Gao Wei, the police finally arrived with Director Nie personally leading the team to maintain order.

Though Gao Wei escaped unscathed thanks to Guan Yu, Bo Jie wasn't as fortunate. When rescued, his clothes hung in tatters. Even Bo Jie's famously patient temperament couldn't endure these frenzied fans. "If you want to hold hands, just hold hands! Why tear clothes?" he fumed. While female fans tearing at him was bad enough, having men also pawing at his garments proved intolerable.

Recalling the ordeal sent shivers down his spine. "What an inauspicious start to our N City visit," he muttered bitterly.

Director Nie spotted Guan Yu amidst the crowd and approached with a broad smile, clasping his hand warmly. "Brother Guan, I rushed over immediately after your call. Not too late, I hope?"

Though Guan Yu had resolved the situation before Director Nie's arrival - and cared little for Bo Jie's plight - he felt touched by the police chief's personal involvement. "Not at all," Guan Yu replied with a smile. "Your consideration is appreciated."

Director Nie guffawed. "We can't be careless with matters concerning Brother Guan!" His gaze shifted to Gao Wei beside Guan Yu, eyebrows rising in surprise before adopting a knowing smirk. "I'll leave you to it then. We'll share drinks another day." He gave Guan Yu's shoulder an approving thump. "Impressive work, young man!"

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Before he could explain the misunderstanding, Director Nie winked conspiratorially and departed. The seasoned police chief had clearly decided not to interrupt what he perceived as a romantic pursuit.

Gao Wei studied Guan Yu with wide-eyed curiosity. While aware of his reputation in the capital, she knew nothing of his N City connections. That a police director - a significant figure locally - showed such deference to Guan Yu, even bordering on sycophancy, both shocked and intrigued her.

The next day, the city erupted in frenzy.

The celestial pop goddess Gao Wei, long celebrated as entertainment's purest jade maiden, had finally been embroiled in scandal.

**Chapter 496: Resolving Internal Matters First**

Since her debut, Gao Wei had maintained an impeccable reputation in the entertainment industry's moral quagmire. No tabloid ever stained her name, not even romantic rumors - save for occasional public confessions from smitten celebrities like Bo Jie, all met with polite refusal.

But today, the impossible happened. Photos flooded "Wei Love You" forums showing Gao Wei arm-in-arm with a mysterious man. Titled "Gao Wei's Intimate Date with Mystery Beau - Pictorial Proof!", the post garnered 100,000 clicks within two hours.

The images captured them strolling like any couple - her gaze tender, his demeanor relaxed. The angle cleverly suggested intimacy, sparking mass speculation about the man's identity.

Forum comments exploded:
"Certified bitch spotted."
"Delete this trash! First commenter's mentally deficient!"
"Touch my goddess and die! Though the guy's kinda mid."
"Perfect match! Haters stay jealous. Bless our Weiwei!"

Meanwhile, the scandal's epicenter remained oblivious. Guan Yu lay entwined with Wenqing, still drowsy from their passion. Since crossing that final threshold, their relationship had shed inhibitions. Of the villa's four women, only Wenqing shared his bed regularly.

Du Xiaojuan offered herself repeatedly, but Guan Yu resisted. Zhao Jinger's treatments involved intimacy, yet he saw her as a sister. As for Feng Xin - alluring figure paired with masculine demeanor - their ambiguous relationship deterred bold moves.

A ringing phone shattered his sleep. Finding himself alone, he groggily answered. "Who's this?"

"Boss! It's Wang Zhen!" came an excited voice. "That photo with Gao Wei yesterday - it's you, right?"

Guan Yu's foggy mind cleared. "What photo?"

"You're trending! The whole city knows you're dating the goddess! Teach us your game, boss!"

Guan Yu shot upright. "Dating Gao Wei? Since when?"

"Check the papers! The guys want pickup lessons this afternoon!"

Hanging up, Guan Yu dressed hastily. Downstairs, he froze at the sight - all four women sat reading newspapers, united in rare harmony... against him.

He attempted a stealthy escape, but twin shouts halted him: "Guan Yu! Come here!"

**Chapter 497: Street Encounter**

Feng Xin's usual masculine demeanor showed rare vulnerability. "We need to resolve internal matters first," she declared, blushing at her ambiguous wording.

Guan Yu's gaze involuntarily dropped to her curves. Perhaps tonight...

"Stop staring!" Feng Xin snapped, face crimson. Wenqing seized the moment: "Darling, I'll let you skip my room tonight. Someone's clearly impatient."

As the women bickered, Guan Yu grabbed Du Xiaojuan. "We're late for Gao Wei's event!" he lied, fleeing the warzone.

In the car, Du Xiaojuan pouted: "No more cuddles for you!"

Guan Yu wisely stayed silent. They arrived at Gao Wei's hotel, greeted by a sharp-eyed woman in her fifties - agent Xu Feng.

"So you're the homewrecker," she spat. "You've destroyed years of image-building!"

Guan Yu sneered: "Stars deserve love too. Unlike you, dried-up spinster."

Xu Feng recoiled as if struck. Gao Wei intervened: "Enough! Xu Feng means well."

The group proceeded to the perfume launch at Senhai Hotel. As they alighted, a suave executive approached Gao Wei with overlong handshake. Guan Yu smirked - high-class harassment.

**Chapter 498: Bo Jie's Declaration**

Guan Yu classified harassers: low-tier thugs versus sophisticated predators. This man fell in the latter category. He considered himself premium grade - conquering through charm alone.

Bo Jie chose this moment for a grand gesture. Amid flashing cameras, he knelt before Gao Wei with roses. "I've loved you for years! Please give me-"

Guan Yu stepped between them, arm slung casually around Gao Wei's waist. "She's taken, buddy." The crowd erupted as cameras captured Gao Wei's blush.
