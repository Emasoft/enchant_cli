For some inexplicable reason, Aze and Xiao Zhi both felt overshadowed by Guan Yu at this moment – not in physical stature, but rather in status and presence.

The mere sight of Guan Yu's magical artifacts was enough to command their reverence. Walking beside him, the two couldn't help feeling diminished in comparison.

Ahead lay the notice board at Tiger Head Peak's central courtyard, where names were posted on a massive placard. These listed all disciples scheduled for tomorrow's one-on-one sparring matches. The board also clearly indicated which of the six temporary arenas – constructed on the central platform connecting the peaks – would host each duel.

These arenas, hastily erected by disciples under each Peak Master's direction, reflected their respective peak's character. While most shared similar utilitarian designs, Tiger Head Peak's stood out with majestic grandeur befitting the Sect Leader's domain. The only exception was Converging Beauty Peak's arena, whose feminine aesthetic differed slightly due to its all-female population.

As the trio approached, they found the board surrounded by concentric rings of disciples. Fortunately, the two-meter tall supporting poles allowed clear viewing from a distance. "Let's check our opponents," urged Aze, pushing forward through the crowd.

Guan Yu scanned the densely packed names. "This tournament format lacks logic," he murmured after failing to locate his name on the current side. "If I face Siqi early, she'd be eliminated immediately. Luck could propel mediocre fighters to the semifinals while skilled ones get matched against stronger opponents."

Xiao Zhi suddenly exclaimed, "There I am! Matched against Wen Ming from Left Void Peak at Arena Three!" The board clearly displayed matchups with arena numbers and times, following simple win-advance rules.

Aze groaned, "My first match's at Front Return Peak's arena – clear disadvantage!" His opponent was Ma Xiao from that same peak.

"At least I'm on home turf," Xiao Zhi boasted. "After my match, I'll come cheer you on. Don't worry – Front Return disciples aren't..." His voice trailed off as they realized Left Void Peak disciples stood nearby, including Wen Ming and A'Cai – both supposedly confined after previous disciplinary actions.

Wen Ming stepped forward, face dark. "So you think I'm just punching bag material?" His loud challenge drew spectators. Xiao Zhi paled, realizing his careless remark had been overheard.

Aze attempted diplomacy: "Brother Wen, let tomorrow's match decide. We meant no offense." But A'Cai sneered, "Spreading slander then hiding behind polite words? Typical Suspended Peak behavior!"

Guan Yu observed silently, noting the Left Void disciples' black belts. He recalled these two – Wen Ming's stubborn pride and A'Cai's cowardice during their forest encounter. Yet now A'Cai postured boldly among peers.

"Enough empty talk!" Wen Ming declared. "Settle this now! If you win, I'll forget this. Lose, and you'll kowtow three times!"

Xiao Zhi's face flushed. "You think I fear you? My father's status means nothing here!" He produced a speckled brown vessel artifact. The crowd murmured – few dared antagonize the Peak Master's son.

A'Cai jeered, "Always hiding behind connections! Even your lapdog Aze gets nothing while you hoard treasures!" This struck a nerve. Aze, though highly talented, indeed received fewer resources.

"Insult Suspended Peak again and I'll..." Xiao Zhi began, but Guan Yu intervened. "Enough! Brawling here risks disqualification." His calm voice cut through the tension. "Save your strength for proper duels."

The confrontation simmered, charged with unspoken threats. Wen Ming's jaw tightened but he stepped back. "Tomorrow then," he spat before storming off, Left Void disciples following with contemptuous glances.

As the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu noticed Aze's clenched fists. The normally composed disciple whispered, "They went too far." Xiao Zhi stared at his artifact, the speckled vessel trembling slightly in his grip.

Above them, the tournament board creaked in the wind, names fluttering like battle standards. Somewhere in the shadows, Peak Master Xiang observed silently, having authorized his disciples' early release. The real game was just beginning.
