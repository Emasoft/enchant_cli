**Chapter 1: Enrollment, the Beautiful Mentor**

The sun shone brightly in a cloudless sky, yet Guan Yu’s mood remained as stifling as the scorching noon heat.

Staring at the car that had vanished beyond the school gates, he struggled to shake off his bitter indignation. *Damn it. How could such a clichéd drama happen to me?*

For over a year, he’d foolishly pined after her, even following her footsteps to apply to this arts academy. Yet now, this farce unfolded.

He’d arrived eagerly for enrollment, waiting over half an hour beneath her dormitory, only for her to declare, *“We’re not compatible. You’re overthinking things… Let’s just stay friends.”* Then he’d watched, helpless, as she climbed into a BMW and drove off.

*If we’re so “incompatible,” why did you bat those soul-stealing eyes at me every day? Why whisper, “I’ll wait for you to find me,” when we got into this academy?*

The cruelest twist? Just as he’d been about to call his soon-to-be cousin-in-law for help with the audition, a cherubic-faced girl had sweetly borrowed his phone—a cheap Nokia worth 200 yuan—and scampered into the girls’ dormitory, giggling mid-call.

*Unbelievable. Even a 200-yuan phone’s worth scamming? And from such an innocent-looking girl?*

Dragging his luggage to the enrollment office, Guan Yu stood despondently in a corner, eyeing his peers. The audition began at 1 p.m.—just half an hour away. Despite his stellar 240-point entrance score, his last hope now hinged on a lost connection.

With no talents to speak of—his singing scarcely better than a wolf’s howl—despair gnawed at him.

His casual sportswear made him an oddity among the formally dressed aspirants. Whispers followed him: *Is he that confident he’ll pass?*

Leaning against the wall, Guan Yu scanned the crowd for a kind face to borrow a phone from when *click-clack* footsteps echoed behind him.

He turned—and froze.

The woman approaching was breathtaking. Her almond eyes glimmered beneath long lashes, lips like ripe cherries, nose delicately sculpted. A fitted blazer strained over her curves, while a knee-length pencil skirt hugged her shapely legs, sheathed in black stockings.

Every male gaze locked onto her. Unfazed, she unlocked a classroom and instructed, “Audition candidates, wait here. Names will be called for interviews. Maintain quiet…”

As students filed in, Guan Yu lingered. “Excuse me, Teacher—is there a Professor Liu here? Around your age?”

The beauty arched a brow. “Many Liu professors. Which one?”

Guan Yu faltered. He knew nothing about his cousin’s fiancée except her surname—and her number was lost with his phone.

A commotion erupted as a portly student shoved past, crushing Guan Yu against the teacher. Her soft curves pressed into him, floral perfume dizzying.

“S-Sorry!” Guan Yu jerked back—only for the胖子 to hip-check him forward again, grinding him against her.

“What are you *doing*?!” she snapped, cheeks flushing as she shoved him off.

Muttering apologies, Guan Yu slunk into the classroom under her glare.

**Chapter 2: The Fat Boy’s Mischief**

Sitting in back, Guan Yu still smelled her lingering fragrance. *So this is the famed beauty of art schools…*

“Lucky bastard,” a sharp-chinned boy whispered. “You actually *hugged* her!”

“Accident,” Guan Yu grimaced. “Blame the fatty.”

As auditions commenced—singing snippets floating through walls—Guan Yu buried his face in his arms. *No phone, no connections. That cute little thief ruined everything.*

When his name echoed down the hall, he trudged to the interview room—and froze.

*Her.* The stunning teacher sat among the panel.

**Chapter 3: Reckless Youth**

“Guan Yu. Male. 22. From L Province, D City.” His introduction lasted three seconds.

The elderly center judge blinked. “That’s… all?”

A bespectacled teacher barked, “Perform this: Your girlfriend eloped. Show us rage!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “So she left. I’ll find better.”

“*Perform* it, you imbecile!”

Something snapped. “Who’s the imbecile?” Guan Yu shot back. “You’ve ogled Miss Liu’s chest eleven times since I entered. Ever heard of subtlety?”

The room erupted. As the accused teacher spluttered, Miss Liu—Liu Shilei—hid a smile.

“Authentic emotional projection,” she mused. “Quite compelling.”

While the panel debated, Guan Yu studied his unlikely ally. *Why defend me? Because of that… incident?*

The red-faced accuser jabbed a finger. “You’ve no skills! No talent!”

“Talent?” Guan Yu leaned forward, eyes glinting. “Let’s discuss *your* talent for hypocrisy…”
