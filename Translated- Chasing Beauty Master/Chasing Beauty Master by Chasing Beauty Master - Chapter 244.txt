He fell, got up again, and kept running. After a while, he tripped once more, rose to his feet, and continued fleeing.

Over and over, until his body became a canvas of wounds.

An overwhelming humiliation burned within him. When had he ever been chased so wretchedly by mere wolfhounds? He swore that if he escaped this hellish place, he would make Guan Yu (Pass Universe) suffer a fate worse than death.

“Guan Yu!” Yang Long (Poplar Dragon) roared inwardly.

“If you hate me this much, why not shout it aloud? Keeping it bottled up might harm your health,” a mocking voice suddenly rang out ahead.

**Chapter 611: You’re Satisfied, But I’m Not Done Yet**

A voice without a visible source—human or ghost?

Yang Long wasn’t easily frightened, yet this spectral tone startled him into halting mid-stride.

“I’m right here. No need to hide your anger. Scream it out before you suffocate,” said Guan Yu, switching on a high-powered flashlight to reveal his deceptively harmless face. His faint smile radiated no warmth, only icy mockery.

“Guan Yu!” Yang Long snarled, his scarred fists trembling with rage.

The fury in his voice would’ve sent the timid fleeing and shaken even the boldest hearts.

Blinded by wrath, Yang Long lunged forward, hurling desperate blows at Guan Yu, who met each strike with calculated readiness.

Too enraged to question how Guan Yu had appeared or read his thoughts, Yang Long fought like a cornered beast.

*A warrior prefers death to dishonor.* Yet Guan Yu’s words pierced deeper than blades, each syllable a lash to Yang Long’s pride.

Hadn’t he suffered enough? Chased like prey by beasts, humiliated, then taunted by this hypocrite feigning concern?

Yang Long snapped.

Though confident he could drag Guan Yu to mutual destruction amid the wolf pack, survival instinct prevailed—he endured the chase, clinging to life despite his wounds.

But now he realized: escape was impossible. Guan Yu had tracked him effortlessly, toying with him like a cat with a mouse.

*If flight fails, fight.*

*Fight to the death.*

Yang Long’s eyes burned crimson as his strikes gained savage momentum.

Guan Yu initially parried, but soon resorted to dodging. Crossing his arms defensively, he grunted as a crushing blow sent him stumbling backward, rubbing his bruised forearms.

“Damn, this bastard’s relentless,” Guan Yu muttered.

Seizing the opening, Yang Long pressed his assault, swinging a meaty fist at Guan Yu’s head. Ropes of muscle rippled under scar-laced skin as he attacked bare-chested in subzero cold, fueled by primal fury.

Guan Yu activated his gravity system, lightening his body by 40%. He narrowly dodged the killing strike, speed amplified—but Yang Long matched his pace, shockingly agile for his bulk.

Spotting the fallen flashlight, Guan Yu lunged to smash it—planning to use his night vision advantage—but Yang Long intercepted. A calloused hand snaked out, viper-quick, twisting Guan Yu’s wrist into submission.

Pain lanced through Guan Yu as Yang Long smirked, driving an elbow into his gut while pivoting to slam him earthward.

Stars exploded behind Guan Yu’s eyes as his body screamed protest.

The crisis worsened: Yang Long’s boot reared back to crush his skull.

In that heartbeat, Guan Yu triggered reversed gravity—Yang Long’s leg suddenly weighed hundreds of pounds. Yet hatred powered the strike downward.

*CRASH.*

Dust billowed. Yang Long gaped—since when did his kicks outmatch his famed fists? Surely Guan Yu’s head had burst like overripe fruit.

“Hahaha!” Yang Long’s manic laughter echoed. To him, Guan Yu’s arrogance—discarding his wolfhound allies—had been suicidal.

“What’s so funny? Enjoying beating me half-dead?”

The laughter died as a thunderous kick to Yang Long’s ribs sent him flying.

“You’ve had your fun,” Guan Yu spat bloodied phlegm, grinning coldly. “Now it’s my turn.”

**Chapter 612: I’m Satisfied, You’re Dead**

Guan Yu didn’t pursue. Rubbing his aching abdomen, he acknowledged Yang Long’s skill—his own martial prowess still lacked polish.

“Need more training with the old masters,” he mused, wincing at lingering pain.

Across the field, Yang Long staggered upright, clutching his side. “How… how aren’t you dead?!”

“Fortune-tellers say I’m hard to kill,” Guan Yu sneered. Truthfully, his gravity system’s buffer and instant healing had saved him—advantages Yang Long, overwhelmed by rage, failed to notice.

A sudden realization struck Yang Long. “You… you cheated?!”

Fear crept through him as he grasped Guan Yu’s unnatural abilities.

“First to discover my secret,” Guan Yu’s voice turned glacial, “and last.”

He stomped the flashlight, plunging them into darkness.

Sweat beaded on Yang Long’s bare torso despite the cold. Fumbling for his backup light, he heard glass shatter—his last hope extinguished.

Terror gripped the once-fearless killer. Blood dripped from palms pierced by clenched nails.

A leg sweep dropped Yang Long to his knees. He retaliated blindly, fists meeting Guan Yu’s in a thunderous clash.

“Impressive,” Guan Yu’s voice drifted mockingly.

“Face me properly!” Yang Long barked.

“Why duel when I can swarm?” Howls erupted as wolfhounds encircled them.

“Coward!”

“Respect is wasted on thugs.” Guan Yu’s contempt hung thick. He respected worthy opponents, not treacherous mercenaries.

Yang Long had to die—a threat too reckless to spare.

Guan Yu blurred into motion. Yang Long, trained in auditory combat, anticipated the kick—but sacrificed his left leg to counterattack.

Guan Yu twisted mid-air, gravity system prolonging his arc. A whip-like spin redirected his strike upward—

*CRUNCH.*

The heel connected with Yang Long’s face, spraying blood. What followed was fifteen minutes of brutal domination.

Panting, Guan Yu stared at the broken man. “Know why I let you live this long?”

**Chapter 613: New Hunt-the-Universe Plan**

Under sickly streetlight, Guan Yu leaned against a lamppost, lighting a crumpled cigarette. Yang Long’s corpse lay nearby—less gruesome than Qian Tong’s, but no less final.

The man had died stubborn, revealing nothing of Zhou Jin’s (Advancing Zhou) plans. His final smirk haunted Guan Yu—what schemes still lurked?

Exhaling smoke, Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. Fifty bodies littered the distance. Let enemies come—they’d learn the price of crossing him.

“What? Yang Long’s dead?!”
