Just as he was about to pounce forward and gulp down water to rehydrate, a sharp shout suddenly rang out. A child of three or four years old had somehow appeared behind Guan Yu. This youth with delicate features wore gray Taoist robes and had a hairpin in his coiled-up hair, resembling those charlatan priests commonly seen in cities.

Guan Yu couldn't help rolling his eyes. "Where did this little fraud come from? Shouldn't you be studying at home instead of wandering in the desert? Who's there to scam in this wasteland?"

"Silence! How dare you spout such nonsense!" The child puffed up with indignation. "I am the thirteenth-generation inheritor of the Qingyang Sect! How could I be compared to those vulgar charlatans? If you insult me again, I'll have lightning strike you!"

Though young, the child carried an imposing air. His delicate features made him look rather adorable. Amused, Guan Yu asked, "Strike me with lightning? Do you think you're the Thunder God or Lightning Mother? Such grand claims!"

"Humph! Doubt my power? Witness my might!"

The child pressed his palms together, forming a strange hand seal. With a loud cry, he thrust out his hands - a glowing ball of lightning materialized and shot viciously towards Guan Yu.

"Holy shit!"

Guan Yu leapt aside in panic. Even so, the lightning strike kicked up dust that left him covered in grime. Spitting out sand, he cursed, "You little brat! You actually attacked me!"

The child laughed triumphantly, but his gloating was cut short when Guan Yu suddenly appeared before him using movement techniques. "Y-you... how do you know the Earth Shrinking Art?"

So this child was indeed a cultivator!

When the child summoned lightning earlier, Guan Yu had already suspected this - the Palm Lightning technique could only be performed by true cultivators. Now hearing the child name his technique confirmed it. Threateningly, Guan Yu demanded, "Tell me! Do you know someone named Ah Fa? Answer or I'll spank you!"

"You... you wouldn't dare!" The child struggled wildly. Though a cultivator, his cultivation level was far below Guan Yu's. When the boy kept kicking, Guan Yu delivered several hard smacks to his bottom, making him wail.

Had it been a beautiful woman, Guan Yu might have relented. Unfortunately, this was just a boy.

"Stop crying or I'll beat your butt swollen!" Guan Yu growled menacingly.

The "ferocious" act worked. Sniffling, the child blinked teary eyes. "Big brother, I really don't know any Ah Fa!"

Considering Ah Fa was merely a peripheral member of their organization, Guan Yu changed tack. "You claim to be from the Qingyang Sect. What kind of sect is that?"

"The Qingyang Sect is the greatest sect in the world!" The child declared proudly. Guan Yu smirked. According to records from that Qing Dynasty cultivator's book, while modern environmental changes made cultivation difficult, major sects still had adaptation methods. There couldn't possibly be only one sect left. If this Qingyang Sect was hidden in deserts, it couldn't be that significant.

"Tell me everything about your sect..."

Before Guan Yu could finish, a rushing wind sound made him clutch the child and dodge aside. Several middle-aged men dressed similarly to the child materialized by the lake. An elder with immortal bearing declared gravely, "Friend, from where do you hail? Why capture our young sect leader? Release him immediately to avoid conflict!"

So the brat really was an heir?

Guan Yu hesitated but held tighter. With such valuable leverage, extracting secrets would be easier. "I'll release him, but first answer - do you know Ah Fa?"

"Ah Fa?" The men exchanged puzzled looks. The elder's eyes flashed warily. "Why seek him?"

Progress! Guan Yu detailed Ah Fa's crimes against Zhou Xiaoyou without holding back. There was no need for deception against these weaker cultivators.

After hearing the account, the elder pondered. "I deeply regret our sect member's actions. We will cure the girl. Please, young friend, visit our sect."

With a wave of his hand, the desolate scenery transformed into pavilions and flowing streams - an immortal's paradise. Guan Yu gaped in astonishment.

The child boasted, "Our unique Qimen Dunjia Art! Never seen before, eh?"

Regaining composure, Guan Yu marveled at the profound mystical arts. Had he not stumbled upon this runaway brat, he'd never have found this hidden sect.

"Merely minor illusion techniques." The elder modestly said. "Friend, your cultivation... have you reached the Fusion Stage?"

"Heartbeat Stage."

Guan Yu's casual reply made everyone gasp. Heartbeat Stage surpassed even their sect leader's cultivation!

Chapter 1105: The Method to Save Zhou Xiaoyou

The elder's mind raced - such an expert must not be offended!

They soon reached the reception hall where Sect Leader Wan Qingyang awaited - a square-jawed, righteous-looking middle-aged man titled Qingyang Zhenren (Pure Yang True Person).

"So this is Heartbeat Stage expert Brother Guan Yu!"

In cultivation circles, strength trumped seniority. Wan Qingyang personally welcomed him despite Guan Yu's youth.

Being called "brother" by an elder, Guan Yu awkwardly bowed. "You honor me."

After pleasantries, Wan Qingyang said, "Regarding Ah Fa... we were too impatient in training disciples, producing this criminal. We'll enforce sect discipline and hand him to you."

"But why would someone from your secluded sect go to the capital?"

From prior talks, Guan Yu knew the Qingyang Sect had remained in this oasis since Qing times. Why suddenly send someone out?

"Ah Fa was actually an ordinary man we rescued. But the ingrate blackmailed us..."

Ah Fa's real name was Zhang Dafa, a hotel owner. Months ago, he got lost in the desert and stumbled into Qingyang territory. After being nursed back to health, he learned about cultivators and coveted their powers.

He threatened to expose the sect's location unless taught cultivation. Though furious, the sect couldn't risk exposure. They made him a peripheral disciple. The stolen ancient text... During a minor library fire before Ah Fa left, several texts were "burned" - now clearly stolen.

"Why release such a troublemaker?"

Wan Qingyang sighed. "Even cultivators need worldly connections. Our remote location brings poverty. Ah Fa's wealth and connections offered hope. He did provide funds... but always demanded elixirs and techniques in return."

"Like the herbs for Gathering Qi Pills?"

"Exactly. Cultivation world forbids harming mortals. We never imagined he'd go this far. Rest assured, even without our intervention, he wouldn't live long."

"Why?"

"Though separate, cultivation and mortal realms maintain accords. Using cultivation powers to oppress mortals is punishable by death. Mortal authorities have cultivator advisors - they'd eliminate him."

Nodding thoughtfully, Guan Yu pressed, "Can you remove the pill essence from Zhou Xiaoyou?"

"Normally impossible... but our sect records a forbidden method. It transfers the medicinal properties to the host, allowing cultivation... but failure brings explosive death from conflicting energies."

"Success rate?"

"Less than 30%."

Guan Yu's heart sank. Let her become a pill cauldron, or risk 70% chance of death?

He stayed overnight to contemplate. Strangely, his detection system had failed within the sect. Could he trust them?

Chapter 1106: Leaving Qingyang Sect

That night, Guan Yu used Zhou Xiaochuan's military satellite phone. After explaining, Zhou said, "At this point, bring them here to treat Xiaoyou."

Next morning, Guan Yu approached Wan Qingyang. Hearing Zhou's high-ranking status, the sect leader worried: "Promise they won't turn against us!"

"Though I can't guarantee completely, I'll protect you if trouble arises."

Satisfied, Wan Qingyang agreed to travel. When Guan Yu suggested military transport, the sect leader blinked. "Can't a Heartbeat Stage expert use artifact flight?"

"Artifact flight?"

Guan Yu's ignorance stunned Wan Qingyang. Producing a leaf, he chanted until it enlarged into a flying vessel. "With your realm, mastering this is simple."

As they soared skyward, Wan Qingyang asked, "How come someone of your power knows so little?"

Guan Yu shared his accidental acquisition of powers. The sect leader nodded. "I see..."
