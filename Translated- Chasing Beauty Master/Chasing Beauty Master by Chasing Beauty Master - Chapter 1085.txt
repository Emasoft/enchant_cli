“A while back, I heard about this woman who took her child to a small country to stage a scam. She’d heard people there were well-mannered and would pay up the moment someone ‘fell’ in front of their cars.

To make her act more convincing, she brought along her two-year-old. This’ll net me a fortune, she thought.

One day, as she loitered by the roadside waiting for prey, she spotted a Porsche SUV approaching at a leisurely pace. The car’s sleek, imposing design screamed wealth. Perfect target.

Clutching her child, she lunged in front of the vehicle and collapsed.

Credit where it’s due—her performance was flawless. The driver barely had time to react before she’d rolled under the car with her child. By the time he slammed the brakes, both were already beneath the chassis.

The driver—a young man—paled as he jumped out. The woman’s lower body lay pinned under the front bumper, the metal pressing against her waist. Another inch forward, and she and the child would’ve been crushed entirely.

The woman, though gaunt and frail, assessed herself. Aside from a throbbing pain on her left thigh—likely a scrape from her dramatic dive—she felt fine. The child, now wailing, only bolstered her act.

The driver frantically dialed his phone, speaking a language she didn’t understand. She lay calmly, basking in the sun. Language barrier? No matter. Money talks.

Ten minutes later, traffic police arrived. The driver gesticulated wildly, relief flooding his face. After inspecting the scene, an officer nodded. The Porsche reversed slowly, freeing the woman.

Problem arose: How to negotiate compensation without a common tongue? The woman couldn’t even speak Hua Xia (Chinese) fluently, let alone foreign languages.

An ambulance soon pulled up. Nurses tried loading her onto a stretcher, but she refused. No way I’m going to a hospital—no kickbacks there!

The driver, impatient, mimed for her to get checked. A nurse intervened, suggesting a translation app. Eyes lit up as the man handed his phone to the woman.

“Are you from Hua Xia?” the screen displayed. She nodded.

Through fragmented translations, he insisted she seek medical care. She countered: “Just pay me. I’ll handle the rest.”

After tense back-and-forth, the question appeared: “How much?”

Her mind raced. Too high? Too low? Finally, she hedged: “Treatment will cost plenty.”

The driver retrieved a leather pouch. Her heart leapt—ka-ching! Foreigners are so efficient, she mused, unlike those stingy folks back home who haggle over every penny.

He handed her a stack of bills—over a dozen, each denominated at 10,000. Her eyes bulged. Nearly 50,000! Ecstatic, she pocketed the cash. The driver even tucked an extra note into the child’s clothes.

Mutual thumbs-up. No need for medics now—she sprang up, pain forgotten. The driver hugged her briefly, all smiles. Such civility!

Limping away, she settled on a roadside planter. Adrenaline faded; her leg burned. Spotting a clinic, she hobbled in.

Using her own translation app, she requested wound care and an IV. The doctor, after unwrapping her haphazard bandages, winced. Gashes ran from ankle to waist, though mostly superficial.

Four hours and two anti-inflammatory drips later, she swaggered to checkout. Flashing a 10,000 note, she awaited change.

The clerk’s smile froze. The screen translated: “Total: 44,400.”

“Motherf***ers!” she screamed. “Robbers! Two IVs cost this much?!”

The clerk shrugged helplessly. Outside, her ‘windfall’ now felt like Monopoly money.
