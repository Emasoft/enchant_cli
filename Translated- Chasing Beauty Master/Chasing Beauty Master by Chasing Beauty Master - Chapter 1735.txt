When Siqi saw the snake, her legs went numb with fear. She didn't know what to do, but fortunately Guan Yu was by her side, which gave her some reassurance. Moreover, Siqi shared Wang Jun's perspective – if they were sitting face-to-face with a fully sentient snake spirit without fear, why should they fear a tamed serpent?

Xiaomei clutched her stomach in laughter as she watched Aze's reaction. "Giggle... Look at your expression! It's killing me! This is my younger sister. Shall I introduce her to you?"

**Chapter 4538: Joy**

Aze didn't wait for formalities. He scrambled away like a rolling gourd, unwilling to remain near the giant serpent. The primal fear of being bitten pulsed through his veins.

Guan Yu understood Xiaomei's mischief – her earlier questioning of Aze had been deliberate provocation. Now she'd summoned this "sister" to terrorize the young man. "Enough," he said coolly. "If you want us to eat in peace, send it away. I knew this was intentional. Does frightening people give you satisfaction? Since we're collaborators, we must accommodate each other. My friend has a phobia of snakes. I won't tolerate this creature appearing before him again."

His tone hardened. "If you can't comply, our partnership ends here."

"Must you be so stern?" Xiaomei pouted. "It was just a joke! Where's your sense of humor?" The scolding deflated her mischievous glee.

"Jokes have boundaries. You've seen his terror firsthand. No more of this." Having spoken, Guan Yu resumed eating with deliberate calm.

Wang Jun interjected wryly, "Your playful antics amuse you, but I'll pay the price tonight." He knew Aze's tendency for night terrors – the sleepwalking, the shouted gibberish. Sharing a felt tent promised sleepless hours.

Meanwhile, Aze remained paralyzed by fear. Xiaomei explained, "I merely let my sister stretch her coils. Though serpentine now, she'll attain human form after more cultivation. Then I can properly introduce her to your friend."

Guan Yu's lips twisted in silent disapproval. Even if transformed, human-demon relationships faced inherent barriers. History told of cultivators loving spirit beings, but such unions bore no offspring – only centuries of companionship ending in lonely extinction. Some considered this eternal bond worth the sacrifice, but Guan Yu rejected the notion for his friends. Honest, virtuous Aze deserved a mortal wife when the time came. As for Wang Jun... if his preferences ever shifted, perhaps the snake-sister-turned-woman might suit him.

With a resigned wave, Xiaomei dismissed her serpentine sibling. "I never realized humans trembled so before scaled kin."

**Chapter 4539: People Are Different**

Guan Yu turned to Wang Jun. "Should Aze suffer nightmares tonight, you'll bear the consequences."

"Perhaps we should make Aze sleep near Xiaomei," Wang Jun suggested dryly. "I'd appreciate an undisturbed night." All knew this impossible – Aze would sooner die than bed down beside his scaled tormentor.

When asked about cultivation periods, Xiaomei revealed, "I took six centuries to assume human form. My sister's equally aged but lingers in serpent-shape. Her metamorphosis depends on self-realization." Guan Yu nodded – this inquiry served Wang Jun's unspoken curiosity.

"Six centuries? Such patience merely to become human?" Wang Jun marveled.

"All creatures seek cultivation," Xiaomei explained. "While power matters, the ultimate goal remains anthropomorphism. Humanity represents peak existence – your world brims with complexities we yearn to experience."

"Why don't humans cultivate into animals?" Wang Jun's jest held edge.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Xiaomei's right. Humanity already occupies the zenith. Reverting would be regression. To be born human is fortune enough."

"Precisely!" Xiaomei agreed. "We spend centuries mastering transformation through bitter trial. No sect teaches us. No primers guide. Only instinct and luck shape our path."

"Your primal existence grants focus," Guan Yu added. "Untroubled by human complexities, serpents cultivate undistracted – hibernating through winters, motionless for seasons. This simplicity enables rapid progress... yet demands millenniums of dedication. The tradeoff?"

He continued, "But upon transformation, such beings become formidable. Consider San Tou – a wolf-spirit who humanized in three centuries. Talent governs all. A dim-witted bear with aptitude might outpace cunning foxes lacking insight. Cultivation favors innate gifts over effort."

"Hence why potential cultivators shun martial arts," Guan Yu concluded. "Why settle for fleeting strength when immortality beckons? Yet few possess the gift. Most martial adepts content themselves with vigor and modest longevity. Commoners? They live unaware of latent talents – some with cultivation potential wasting it on swordsmanship, others destined for mediocrity."

Xiaomei's situation proved unremarkable – talent often flowed through bloodlines. Her serpent-sister's delayed transformation suggested weaker inherited aptitude. Guan Yu had observed Xiaomei's true form – a massive ochre serpent dwarfing her sibling, perhaps due to greater spiritual energy.

**Chapter 4540: Conditions**

The expedition to find Miao City loomed. Though aware of Xiaomei's ulterior motives, Guan Yu accepted her guidance. His companions grumbled about the ever-present serpent but lacked alternatives. Aze's phobia worsened – only Xiaomei's human guise (a stunning maiden) proved tolerable.

Regret tinged Guan Yu's thoughts – he should've forbidden the snake's visibility earlier. Now the damage spread beyond Aze; even Siqi needed his proximity to remain calm.

Post-lunch preparations stalled by Xiaomei's antics – she'd wasted the morning provoking Siqi for Guan Yu's attention. Resolved to maintain distance, Guan Yu decided to redirect her advances toward Wang Jun when necessary.

Before departure, Guan Yu sought Xiaomei in her tent. "A proposal benefiting all: leave your sister here. Our journey needs no serpentine presence. Your sect's nearby – entrust her to disciples."

"My sister requires worldly experience to hasten transformation!" Xiaomei protested. "She understands speech! Harmless!"

Guan Yu remained unmoved. The expedition's success demanded compromise – but whether serpent or woman, tensions would coil tightly around their fellowship.
