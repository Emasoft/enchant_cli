Guan Yu said, “Royal Son-in-Law Jiang and I have devised a solution to the matter. In a couple of days, Royal Son-in-Law Jiang will bring Eldest Miss Jiang into the palace and spread the word that the East Sea Dragon Pearl has been presented to the Emperor as a gift. This way, we can divert the attention of those with ulterior motives away from Eldest Miss Jiang.”

“Hmm, this is indeed a good plan. Alright, I won’t keep you—the show is about to start.” Chu Fan turned and hurried off, leaving Guan Yu uncertain of what exactly was on his mind.

Guan Yu smiled faintly and glanced toward the spectator seats. The crowd was massive. Eldest Miss Jiang had warned that trouble might erupt here today, though Guan Yu couldn’t fathom where she’d gotten such foreboding. Her visible anxiety suggested she feared for Chu Fan’s safety. Despite the noisy atmosphere, Guan Yu couldn’t imagine what calamity might occur.

A man dressed in a familiar clown costume ascended the stage. “Quiet, everyone! The performance is about to begin!” His shrill voice cut through the clamor, silencing the audience as all eyes fixed on the stage.

Guan Yu recognized the clown’s voice. Once the crowd settled, the clown theatrically unfurled a red cloth scroll. Initially blank, he waved it several times before the words “Performance Begins” materialized. The audience erupted into applause and cheers. Guan Yu found the trick amusing, reminiscent of a magic act.

The ensuing operatic performance, however, lost Guan Yu entirely. Though an art form, the stylized singing and movements held little appeal for him. He mused how dull life here must be—no television or phones, just operas and storytelling to pass the time.

Disinterested, Guan Yu decided to leave for fresh air. As he turned to go, he spotted Patriarch Cao standing in the dimly lit VIP balcony. Even in the shadows, Guan Yu could see the man’s venomous expression. This boded ill.

Guan Yu’s instincts flared. Patriarch Cao had likely come with malice. After the humiliating incident at Wanyang Restaurant, where Jiang Yuan Kai had publicly expelled him and shielded Guan Yu, Patriarch Cao’s son Cao Di had been left bedridden with severe injuries. The patriarch’s smoldering rage demanded vengeance, yet direct retaliation against Jiang Yuan Kai’s faction was unwise.

Learning that Wan Hong—a figure under Jiang Yuan Kai’s patronage—had purchased the Hongyan Theater, and aware of Chu Fan’s ties to Eldest Miss Jiang, Patriarch Cao saw an opportunity. “You think using imperial authority to sentence my son for insulting an official ends this?” he seethed silently. “This is merely the beginning. I’ll make you regret crossing me.”

As the performance commenced, Guan Yu watched Patriarch Cao’s snarling face until the man abruptly departed. “That old wretch is plotting something,” Guan Yu muttered. “If he dares disrupt this theater, I’ll ensure he regrets it for life. Beating his son was a warning. If he persists, I’ll crush him utterly.”

Suspicious of Cao’s sudden exit, Guan Yu tried to follow but found the aisles choked with spectators. He opted for a rear exit, circling the building to intercept the patriarch. By the time he reached the front, Cao had vanished. Returning to the VIP balcony revealed no trace of him. Perhaps the threat had been a false alarm.

From the elevated seats, the stage view was impeccable. Guan Yu noticed another VIP—a man in his late fifties exuding innate nobility. This was none other than Patriarch Qin, head of the Qin Clan, foremost of the capital’s four great families. His daughter’s marriage to the Second Prince rendered the Qin Clan untouchable.

Just as Guan Yu relaxed, a thunderous crash shattered the air. The stage collapsed, plunging performers into the two-meter pit below. Chaos erupted as the audience panicked. Guan Yu realized Patriarch Cao’s sabotage—the supports must have been tampered with.

“I hope no one’s seriously hurt!” Guan Yu rushed toward the wreckage.

Chu Fan, trapped in the debris, barked orders: “Evacuate the crowd! Tell them the show is canceled—free admission next time!” His ankle was twisted, immobilizing him.

Guan Yu reached him. “Are you alright?”

“My foot’s stuck. Help me up—we need to calm the crowd.”

Nearby, a performer screamed—a metal rod had impaled his calf, pinning him under a plank. Guan Yu channeled his inner qi, numbed the man’s pain points, and swiftly extracted the rod. After bandaging the wound, he turned to others.

“This was no accident,” Guan Yu told Chu Fan. “It’s deliberate.”

Outside, the crowd demanded refunds. A provocateur shouted for fivefold compensation, inciting others. Guan Yu suspected Cao’s henchmen among them.

“You want payment?” Guan Yu’s voice boomed with authority, silencing the mob. “Step forward, and I’ll give it to you!”

The instigator shrank back. “You’d threaten us? Is there no law?”

Guan Yu’s aura cowed the crowd. Yet the agitator’s words had struck a chord. Chu Fan, leaning on Guan Yu, announced refunds for all. Dissenters persisted, but Guan Yu’s glare quelled further rebellion.

The crisis simmered, yet Guan Yu knew this was merely Patriarch Cao’s opening move. The true storm loomed ahead.
