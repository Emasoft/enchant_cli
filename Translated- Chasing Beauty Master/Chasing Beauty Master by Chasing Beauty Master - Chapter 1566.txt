Under normal circumstances, within the Demon Soul Sect, every member with an official position possessed their own token. The back of these tokens should bear the owner's name.

However, Wang Jun's token did not belong to him—it had been casually given to him by Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus). The female proprietor held it in her hand and deliberately flipped it over to examine the name.

Fearful of complications, Wang Jun quickly added, "This token was given to me directly by the Young Master. Though I don't truly hold the responsibilities of a Hall Master, if you doubt me, you may inspect my blood. Can you detect any irregularities?"

It was evident this woman had never heard of Guan Yu's name. Had she known of the relationship between the Young Master and Guan Yu within the Demon Soul Sect, she would have treated Guan Yu with the same deference as the Young Master herself, not daring the slightest disrespect.

By showing his blood, Wang Jun aimed to reveal the Blood Toxin within him—the most definitive proof of his identity.

Those afflicted with Blood Toxin possessed blood distinct from ordinary people. While outsiders might not recognize it, those in the know could discern it at a glance.

The blood of a Blood Toxin victim appeared pale yet unnaturally dense. After examining it, the woman nodded. "Your identity is largely confirmed. However, this Hall Master token of yours seems irregular. You know the rules: only those of Hall Master rank or higher may utilize dedicated message channels."

Annoyed by her obstinacy, Wang Jun replied coldly, "I've already explained the urgency. Do you think I came here to idle away time? The token has been verified, my blood inspected, and my identity confirmed. Yet you still refuse? Stop jesting!"

"Mind your tone," she retorted. "Though you serve the Left Envoy, no exceptions are made here. If dissatisfied, you may leave immediately. Since childhood, I've served as an Altar Master of the Demon Soul Sect, loyal to the Demon Lord. Never once have I been reproached for my duties."

Confronted with such inflexibility, Wang Jun sighed. "Very well. Investigate Guan Yu yourself—learn of his ties to the Young Master. Should your delays invite her wrath, don't say I didn't warn you."

The Altar Master's ignorance of Guan Yu was unsurprising. In Ha'er City, the sect maintained a low profile to avoid government scrutiny, focusing solely on establishing roots and gathering intelligence. Their outpost here had two mandates: consolidate their foothold and relay messages—nothing more.

**Chapter 4061: What Next?**

Concealing their Demon Soul Sect affiliation was crucial for survival here. Open exposure risked annihilation by either authorities or rival sects.

"Apologies, but caution is necessary," the woman stated. "I may offend the Left Envoy and Young Master, but I cannot break protocol to relay your message."

Guan Yu frowned. At Cloud Azure Sect, he'd enjoyed free rein, but here, his name held no sway. Without recognition from the sect members, his authority evaporated. Wang Jun's disputed Hall Master token compounded their troubles.

If this outpost refused to send word, Wang Xiaorong might not arrive within two days. Without reinforcements, their mission would fail.

"Are there other Demon Soul Sect outposts in Ha'er City?" Wang Jun pressed. "If you won't help, we'll seek elsewhere. But if this delay causes catastrophe, the responsibility rests on you."

His veiled threats fell flat. As the sect's sole female Altar Master, her position, though mid-ranked, commanded respect. Directly defying higher authorities was unthinkable.

"Urgency doesn't override protocol," she maintained. "With your unclear status, I cannot assist."

Seeing no progress, Guan Yu rose. "Let's go. This path is closed." He tossed silver scraps onto the table, appetite gone. As they departed, the Altar Master quietly dispatched a messenger, sensing potential consequences.

Outside, Wang Jun grumbled, "That woman recognized neither of us! How provincial!"

Guan Yu detected the jab at his reputation. "I'm no emperor," he shrugged. "Distance isolates this place from sect affairs."

"What now? Abandon Prince Zou's request?"

"We'll search elsewhere. Fast horses to neighboring towns—find any outpost where my name resonates."

**Chapter 4062: Buying a Horse (Part 1)**

"Splitting up may help," Wang Jun suggested. "I'll scour Ha'er City while you ride out. With a day and a half left, perhaps word can still reach the sect. Wang Xiaorong must be frantic since we left Cloud Azure Sect."

Nodding, Guan Yu sought a renowned stable. The spacious courtyard housed prized steeds, their buyers typically nobles or royalty. A fine horse here symbolized status, akin to luxury cars in modern times.

Ignored upon entry, Guanyu wandered past paddock fences—a safety measure against escaped horses. His eyes locked onto a crimson stallion, taller than others, its glossy coat gleaming arrogantly in the sun.

An elderly stableman approached, scrutinizing Guan Yu's disguised form—a plain-looking old man. "Here to sell? Use the back gate."

Guan Yu glanced down at his humble disguise. "I'm buying."

The man's dismissive tone sharpened. "All our horses are fast."

"Speed is relative," Guan Yu retorted, producing a clinking pouch. "Enough to purchase this entire stable."

The owner's demeanor flipped upon seeing the gold leaves. "My apologies, esteemed sir! This way, please!" Servants scrambled to serve tea.

Guan Yu sipped the sour brew and grimaced. "I need one fast horse. That red stallion caught my eye."

"Ah, an excellent choice! Though..." The owner hesitated.

"Not for sale? Or beyond my means?"

"Neither! Merely... let me show you our selections."

**Chapter 4063: Buying a Horse (Part 2)**

In the premium stables, superior breeds neighed in tidy stalls. The owner preened, "Our finest, just for you!"

Guan Yu's gaze kept drifting back to the crimson stallion—its proud stance and elongated legs promised unmatched speed. The owner noted his interest, calculating profits.
