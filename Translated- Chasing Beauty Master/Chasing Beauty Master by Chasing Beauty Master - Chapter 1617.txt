Guan Yu pondered that if the Demon Lord had been gravely wounded and remained unhealed over the years, it could be considered a boon for the entire martial world. In a way, Wang Xiaorong had indirectly saved countless lives across the realm.

The Demon Lord was a formidable figure. Even while bearing severe injuries, his cultivation had not diminished. Had he remained unscathed all these years, his power would have soared to unimaginable heights—perhaps even surpassing Xuanming of the Cloud Azure Sect.

If that were the case, the current peace in the martial world would have long shattered. The greater the Demon Lord’s strength, the greater the peril, for his ambitions knew no bounds. He would never allow the righteous sects to live in tranquility. A second Great War between the righteous and demonic factions might have erupted long ago.

Such a conflict would bring calamity to all. Thus, the Demon Lord’s injuries had delayed his quest to dominate the martial world. Coupled with resistance from the righteous factions, the current stalemate between the two sides persisted in a fragile equilibrium.

But should the Demon Lord ever recover or obtain the Eight-Drum Technique, his power would become unstoppable. Only then would true terror descend.

Legends spoke of the Eight-Drum Technique’s four volumes. With them, the Demon Lord could resurrect the sealed Tian Yuan, unleashing chaos unparalleled. All these catastrophes had been postponed due to Wang Xiaorong’s childhood whims and recklessness.

**Chapter 4200: Balance of Power**

Guan Yu wondered if there was any way to thwart the Demon Lord’s ambitions. Conversely, Xuanming of the Cloud Azure Sect ceaselessly sought to eradicate the Demon Soul Sect.

The current deadlock hung by a thread. Should either side gain dominance or falter, war would ignite instantly.

In a way, the Demon Lord’s current state was precarious perfection. Were he slightly stronger, his first target would undoubtedly be the Cloud Azure Sect. Only by destroying it could the Demon Soul Sect dominate the martial world, as lesser factions posed no threat.

Conversely, were the Demon Lord slightly weaker, Xuanming would seize the chance to annihilate the Demon Soul Sect, ushering in lasting peace.

Thus, the present balance could not shift. Any disruption would plunge the martial world into upheaval. Even if the righteous sects vanquished the demonic faction, another would inevitably rise—a law of nature where good and evil eternally coexisted.

Moreover, Guan Yu knew the so-called righteous sects merely cloaked themselves in virtue, while the demonic factions wore their malice openly. Yet distinguishing true good from evil was impossible. To Guan Yu, the Cloud Azure Sect’s internal scheming and infighting seemed little better than the Demon Soul Sect’s overt wickedness.

One was evil in plain sight; the other, in shadow. Should the Great War ever erupt, Guan Yu believed he alone—if still present—could stand as the mediator, the sole hope to prevent the conflict.

He wished harm upon neither side. Though the Cloud Azure Sect held little sentimental value for him, Elder Lu and Elder Jiu had shown him great kindness.

While Xuanming was cunning, he remained Guan Yu’s master. The treasures Xuanming had bestowed had saved Guan Yu’s life repeatedly, a debt he could not ignore.

Then there was Siqi, the first woman Guan Yu had met at the Cloud Azure Sect. He still remembered getting lost and being mistaken for a trespasser, which led her to detain him and take him to Convergence Peak.

And Xiao Zhi—despite everything, Guan Yu wished no ill upon the Cloud Azure Sect. As for the Demon Soul Sect, though Wang Xiaorong was his only concern there, her significance outweighed all else.

Her father-daughter bond with the Demon Lord made the sect’s survival imperative. If war erupted now, Guan Yu might lack the power to stop it. But once he broke his seals and regained his peak strength as a Realm Sovereign, everything would change.

Combined with his mastery of both martial and mystical arts, along with his divine artifacts, Guan Yu believed he could stand between the Demon Lord and Xuanming, rendering their conflict impossible.

Wang Xiaorong suddenly asked, “Guan Yu, as a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect, what will you do if the Great War begins? Will you stand with me or your sect?”

“It torments me,” he replied firmly, “but rest assured—I won’t let it come to that. I’ll stand in the middle, aiding neither side.”

She nestled against his shoulder. “I believe you can.”

“It’s late,” he said, stroking her hair. “Let’s rest.”

**Chapter 4201: Past Loves (Part 1)**

At dawn, Prince Zou’s convoy assembled outside the inn, ready to depart. Their ranks had swelled to nearly a hundred—a formidable force.

Though filled with experts, few knew the daily cost exceeded two hundred silver taels—a staggering sum even for the prince, who gritted his teeth to sustain it.

The expanded numbers comforted Prince Zou. Even a hundred-strong Imperial Guard unit would pose little threat now.

Guan Yu suggested, “With our numbers, scouts should survey the road ahead for safety.”

The prince agreed, delegating the task to the captain, who assigned it to Hong Ren—his subordinates still loyal.

The caravan set out for Bajia City to the south. Two routes lay before them: a detour west through a merchant town, adding two days’ travel, or a direct path requiring one day but offering no rest stops.

Prince Zou deemed their force strong enough to face any threat head-on. Though the detour offered safety, the extra days would cost four hundred taels—an unbearable expense. Eager to reach the capital swiftly, he ordered, “We take the direct route to Bajia City.”

The journey remained uneventful. Scouts sent by Hong Ren—seasoned sentries from Redpeak Mountain—reported no disturbances.

Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong rode behind the prince’s carriage when Hong Ren approached, grinning. “Might I ask—are you two married? You’re inseparable.”

“You’re right,” Wang Xiaorong declared before Guan Yu could respond.

Hong Ren chuckled, “Forgive my bluntness, but you seem mismatched in age—an old bull grazing on tender grass! Just a jest to lighten the dreary journey.”

Guan Yu laughed, “No offense taken. This ‘old bull’ is fortunate the ‘tender grass’ chooses to be grazed.”

Given Guan Yu’s disguised appearance as a fifty-year-old and Wang Xiaorong’s youthful mask, the remark fit.

“A man’s dream,” Hong Ren mused. “Who wouldn’t want a perpetually young lover?”

Guan Yu countered, “And you? Thirty-something with no wife or children on Redpeak Mountain?”

“None,” Hong Ren admitted. “Just a lone calf!”

Surprised by his humor, Guan Yu pressed, “A man of your looks, status, and followers—how have you no woman? You jest.”

Hong Ren’s smile faded. “Truth be told, I loved but one girl. She married another. My heart never moved on.”

Wang Xiaorong leaned in. “Why? Did she not return your feelings? Why let her go?”

“She did,” he said quietly. “We grew up together. I teased her endlessly, yet we understood each other. When her parents arranged a match, she came to me… but I failed her.”

“What happened?” Wang Xiaorong urged.

**Chapter 4202: Past Loves (Part 2)**

Hong Ren hesitated, then relented. “Her name was Yu Qianqian. After I saved her from bandits, her family thanked me… then warned me to stay away. They’d never let their daughter wed a ‘thug.’”

He never accepted their gifts. Qianqian remained unaware, believing their secret meetings were escapes from her stifling home.

Though the town scorned him, she saw his integrity beneath the mischief. When her parents confined her, cutting all ties, Hong Ren despaired. Could he truly provide for her?

When her betrothal to a wealthy, cultured suitor was announced, Hong Ren confronted her family but was driven out. Comparing himself to the groom, he deemed himself unworthy and withdrew.

Later, Qianqian slipped out, professing her love and vowing to wait. Inspired, Hong Ren vowed to rise above his station.

Years later, as Redpeak Mountain’s leader, he returned—only to learn she’d married and found happiness. Heartbroken, he severed all contact.

“I resented her briefly,” he admitted. “But societal pressures… A woman unwed past her prime faces ridicule. I understood her choice.”

Wang Xiaorong sighed. “Love unspoken is love wasted.”

Hong Ren nodded. “Some stories have no happy endings. Mine… is one.”

The caravan pressed on, the past lingering like dust in their wake.
