Feng Xin’s willow-like brows furrowed slightly as she fell silent, carefully pondering Guan Yu’s words.

Zhou Jin’s gang’s movements—whether confirmed or speculative—were all relayed to Feng Xin by Guan Yu. After all, on the surface, N City was still under their control, so Feng Xin was no stranger to Zhou Jin and his men, remaining vigilant against them at all times.

Calming her mind, she realized this possibility could not be dismissed.

Since it concerned Guan Yu’s safety, it was better to err on the side of caution. With worry lacing her voice, Feng Xin said, “Then you shouldn’t wade into this muddy water. If Xiao Xiong could dominate L City’s underworld in half a year, he’s no soft persimmon to be squeezed at will. You should trust his ability to handle this.”

As expected yet paradoxically unexpected, Guan Yu shook his head without hesitation. His gaze was resolute, his tone deliberate yet unyielding. “If Zhou Jin and Cheng Gui are truly behind this, even if it’s an obvious trap, I must step into it to test its depths.”

Knowing there are tigers in the mountains, he still chose to tread the path.

By emotion, reason, or duty—Guan Yu had to make this trip to L City.

This was his decision, one no one could sway.

**Chapter 616: Journey to L City**

Looking at Guan Yu’s determined face, Feng Xin sighed inwardly—*A Master in Pursuit of Beauty*.

Truthfully, she had already anticipated his choice, yet she couldn’t resist asking. Perhaps even she didn’t fully understand why—out of concern or ulterior motives, it remained unclear.

If anyone claimed Guan Yu coveted Xiao Xiong’s hard-earned empire or his promises, Feng Xin would reject it outright. She knew him too well.

Guan Yu sought wealth through principle, not petty greed. His unwavering resolve to brave the tiger’s den likely stemmed from his honorable bond with Xiao Xiong.

This loyalty and righteousness were precisely why she admired him.

Yet the thought of Guan Yu plummeting into an abyss, his body lost forever, chilled her heart.

Unconsciously, her delicate brows knitted deeply.

Guan Yu sensed the profound care in her words, warmth blooming in his chest. Softly, he said, “Sis, I’m not acting impulsively. I’m not aiding Xiao Xiong for his power but for the stability of N City’s underworld.”

Feng Xin looked up, confusion clouding her eyes.

Guan Yu sighed, explaining slowly, “If Cheng Gui’s attacks were merely about reclaiming power in L City, I trust Xiao Xiong could defeat him again. But I suspect deeper forces at play. If Zhou Jin is involved, Wan Qianshan’s shadow will follow. Should all three unite, Xiao Xiong will fall. If he falls, N City’s underworld—so close to L City—will face devastation. A reshuffle would harm you, me, and the remaining elders. Thus, I must stir this muddy water, churning it until the skies darken. Who emerges victorious remains unknown.”

By the end, his eyes sharpened like blades, an aura of lethality radiating from him.

To Feng Xin, however, this carried an indescribable allure. Her gaze brimmed with undisguised admiration.

With matters settled, Feng Xin could only vow to protect Guan Yu’s safety at all costs.

“Shall I go with you?” she tentatively asked.

Guan Yu firmly shook his head, smiling. “Sis, I know you want to help, but with Zhou Jin’s schemes looming, I can’t rest easy if you’re not here guarding N City.”

Pausing, he added, “For this trip, I’ll take Niu Le. Let him gain experience and temper himself.”

Feng Xin nodded slightly, warmth flooding her heart. Guan Yu’s earlier words alone affirmed her place in his heart—that was enough. Maintaining composure, she said, “If you need reinforcements there, inform me.”

Guan Yu didn’t refuse. Even the mightiest couldn’t withstand an army’s onslaught. Though gifted with extraordinary abilities, he wasn’t foolhardy enough to challenge armed hordes alone.

“When do you leave?” Feng Xin asked.

“No rush. After breakfast,” Guan Yu replied, flashing a bright smile.

Feng Xin’s nose tingled, eyes glistening as a smile blossomed on her face.

Holding hands through adversity felt distant to her now.

All she wished was to watch Guan Yu enjoy her breakfast daily. The rest, she left to fate.

Though Guan Yu prioritized Xiao Xiong’s crisis, he still stayed for this meal. Her gratitude was undeniable.

Thus, wrapped in bittersweet happiness, they shared a cheerful breakfast—unaware if it might be their last.

Guan Yu’s fate hung in the balance.

After eating, Guan Yu fetched Niu Le from Luo Cheng’s place, dragging the drowsy man into the car. After briefing Luo Cheng, he drove out of N City toward L City.

Uncertain of the troubles ahead—or if he’d return—he’d entrusted necessary arrangements to Feng Xin, trusting her to manage any fallout.

On the highway, Niu Le slumped in the passenger seat, bleary-eyed and grumpy, resentful at being torn from a woman’s embrace.

Once a “three-second wonder,” Niu Le had evolved into a “four-time champion nightly,” rivaling even Guan Yu.

Last night, he’d overexerted himself five times, collapsing at dawn—only to be violently hauled into the car. Resentment simmered.

“Boss, why the rush?” Niu Le yawned listlessly.

Guan Yu eyed him, torn between amusement and irritation.

Experienced in such matters, Guan Yu recognized Niu Le’s exhaustion. While laughable, this state could get him killed in real combat—hence the irritation.

Snapping, Guan Yu said, “This isn’t a joyride. We’re heading into a fight. Don’t embarrass me by getting your face bashed in.”

At “fight,” Niu Le’s eyes lit up. Bored in N City, his vigor wasted on women, the born troublemaker thrived on chaos. Guan Yu’s demeanor hinted this would be epic.

“How big’s this fight? Small ones aren’t worth my time,” Niu Le grinned.

“The lethal kind. Satisfied?” Guan Yu glared.

“Perfect! Finally, I’ll sweat somewhere besides a woman’s bed.” Niu Le grabbed a canvas bag from the back, lovingly stroking his machete as he licked his lips.

**Chapter 617: The Meeting**

“Seems my worries were unfounded, *Master in Pursuit of Beauty*,” Guan Yu mused, reassured by Niu Le’s eagerness.

As Guan Yu’s influence grew, Niu Le had grown complacent. Yet his untamed spirit remained intact—a relief.

Bringing only Niu Le was deliberate.

With limited intel on L City, mobilizing forces risked alerting enemies and weakening their base—especially if Zhou Jin struck. A small team offered agility. Had it not been for Niu Le’s training, Guan Yu would have ventured alone to maximize his abilities.

Thus, they plunged into the tiger’s den.

As J Province’s capital, L City’s prosperity dwarfed N City’s, its power structures infinitely more complex.

They arrived at noon.

Following Feng Xin’s directions, Guan Yu navigated the skyscraper-laden city until reaching their destination—Xiao Xiong’s stronghold, the Mokai Group.

Exiting the car, Guan Yu gazed up at the towering edifice, feeling insignificant. The fifty-story colossus dwarfed Luo Cheng’s twenty-floor building.

This sight deepened his respect for Xiao Xiong’s prowess. Yet sorrow flickered across his face—Feng Xin’s intel revealed Mokai’s stocks teetering on collapse under Cheng Gui’s assaults. Without intervention, this empire would fall.

“Boss, quit staring! Let’s go in!” Niu Le urged.

Guan Yu inhaled deeply, strode forward, and stepped into the arena of L City’s underworld power struggles.

A security guard halted them—outsiders without credentials.

“I’m here to see your CEO, Xiao Xiong,” Guan Yu said patiently.

“No entry without ID,” the guard sneered, oozing disdain.

Guan Yu chuckled dryly. Mokai’s pride extended even to its guards—a testament to Xiao Xiong’s leadership. Tightened security during crises made sense.

“Then inform Xiao Xiong that Guan Yu awaits him here,” he pressed.

“Think you’re someone special?” The guard scoffed. “The CEO’s busy. He’s not here.”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. “Either you notify him, or I’ll find him myself.”

The guard stiffened, fear prickling his spine before false courage surged. “I said he’s not—”

“Guan Yu?” A voice interrupted.

Turning, Guan Yu saw a vaguely familiar man.

“It *is* you!” The man beamed.

“You are…?”

“Lin Feng! We clashed at a bar over a woman—remember?”

Recognition dawned. Lin Feng—once allied with Wang Hu, who’d harassed Mo Ling. Guan Yu had beaten them both. Lin Feng’s lingering respect for his parents had left an impression.

“Here to see Brother Xiao?” Lin Feng asked cautiously.

“Brother Xiao? Xiao Xiong?”

Lin Feng nodded. “He’s my boss. But after you arrive, who’s boss might change.” He shot Guan Yu a meaningful look.

Guan Yu frowned. “Explain.”

Lin Feng smiled. “You’ll see. But brace yourself—it won’t be smooth.” He gestured them inside.

Guan Yu followed, ignoring the petrified guard.

**Chapter 618: The New Boss**

*Even a dog grows arrogant when its master is mighty.*

The guard stood frozen, realizing his folly. Lin Feng—one of Xiao Xiong’s five lieutenants, a figure of immense influence—had addressed Guan Yu with deference.

Trembling, he awaited retribution.
