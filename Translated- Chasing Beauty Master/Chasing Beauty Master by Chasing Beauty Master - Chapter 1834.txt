“I’ll show you what the law is,” Guan Yu declared, amplifying his voice with internal energy so that every person present heard him with crystalline clarity.

He continued, “I’ll give you ten counts. Take your men and scram. Go tell Old Master Cao that I’ve confirmed his involvement in this. He destroyed my theater and injured my people. I *will* settle this with him. Tell him to guard his miserable life. If you keep stirring trouble here, I swear you’ll be carried out horizontally!”

Fear flickered across the opponent’s face. The authority Guan Yu exuded was irresistible. Even Chu Fan, standing beside him, felt a chill pierce his heart.

Guan Yu intended to drive them away through sheer intimidation. He was certain these were troublemakers sent by Old Master Cao. If they refused to leave, he’d show no mercy—not that he planned to spare Cao’s lackeys regardless.

The man glanced around, hesitating as if to retort, but swallowed his words upon meeting Guan Yu’s gaze. He retreated unsteadily, muttering, “You…you lawless brutes! I’ll report this to the authorities! Mark my words!”

**Chapter 4819: Provocation**

The disgraced man fled. Guan Yu withdrew his energy, restoring calm. With the ringleader gone, the remaining crowd lost their appetite for chaos.

“We apologize for tonight’s failed performance,” Guan Yu announced, “but as you’ve witnessed, we suffered heavy losses—many injured. Let it be known this was no accident. The Cao family orchestrated it. That man was sent by Old Master Cao himself to sabotage us. I have evidence. When time allows, I’ll ensure the Cao family repays this blood debt.”

“Now, please line up orderly at the entrance. Regardless of circumstances, we take responsibility. We’ll refund every ticket,” Chu Fan added.

After the provocateur left, Guan Yu’s gaze swept the crowd, knowing more of Cao’s spies lurked among them. Wisely, none dared further disturbances.

Guan Yu understood the Cao family’s immense political influence. Pursuing justice through official channels would prove futile—he lacked concrete evidence anyway. Even with proof, the Cao clan’s court connections could twist accusations into countercharges.

But Guan Yu vowed to investigate thoroughly and confront the Cao family directly. This matter wouldn’t end here.

With the crowd appeased, only the theater troupe remained in the hall. Chu Fan sat slumped in an audience seat, head bowed in silent despair.

The performance had collapsed spectacularly. Financial losses paled beside the injuries—his own fractured foot would require months to heal, halting all upcoming shows.

Inspecting the collapsed stage below, Guan Yu confirmed his suspicions. Emerging, he sat beside Chu Fan and ordered, “Vice Manager, summon the entire troupe. I have announcements.”

The vice manager hesitated. “But many are injured—two severe cases, fractures, lacerations… Even Manager Chu’s injury is mild by comparison. The doctor just arrived. Shouldn’t we—”

“Everyone,” Guan Yu interrupted. “If they breathe, bring them. Carry those who can’t walk. Doctors can wait.”

The vice manager looked to Chu Fan, who nodded weakly. “Do as Master Wanhong says.”

Chu Fan sensed Guan Yu’s intent. Since Guan Yu declared this sabotage rather than accident, Chu Fan had agonized over the betrayal.

Three days—that’s all it took. Three days since arriving in the capital, gifting the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl, purchasing this estate. Two days since clashing with the Cao family at Wanyang Tavern. Yet Old Master Cao had orchestrated this vicious retaliation so swiftly.

Guan Yu realized he’d underestimated the Cao patriarch’s ruthlessness. The theater’s massive stage, standing solidly for a year with thick wooden supports, couldn’t have collapsed naturally.

His inspection revealed the truth—each arm-thick support pillar had been cleanly sawn through. Not stress fractures, but deliberate sabotage. Twelve pillars severed at the base turned the stage into a death trap.

Worse, someone had planted foot-long iron spikes—thumb-thick with sharpened tips—beneath the stage. When performers fell through, these spikes awaited them. Miraculously, none struck vital organs—one through a calf, another a shoulder. Had positions varied slightly, deaths were inevitable.

Chu Fan’s sprained foot seemed fortunate by comparison. Rage simmered in Guan Yu—Old Master Cao’s cruelty demanded retaliation. Before leaving the capital to seek the Eight-Sided Drum martial arts, he vowed to eradicate the Cao family.

**Chapter 4820: The Traitor**

The vice manager returned with twenty-odd troupe members—seven injured, some carried on stretchers. Complaints murmured among the wounded: why this summons when treatment awaited?

Guan Yu rose, surveying the group. “Apologies for gathering you thus, but this matter can’t wait. All medical costs and losses fall on me. Severely injured will receive pensions. Red Charm Theater won’t fall.”

His words calmed the crowd. “We’ll rebuild—larger, grander! An iron stage next time, impervious to saws!”

The declaration stirred hopeful murmurs. Then Guan Yu’s voice turned thunderous: “But first—who among you betrayed us to the Cao family?”

Chu Fan stood awkwardly, pain and heartbreak mingling. “For a year, I’ve treated you as family. Though wages came late, never shortchanged. Why? Why sabotage us?”

Gasps erupted. Guan Yu brandished a sawn support beam. “Twelve pillars cut through—hours of silent work. Iron spikes installed overnight. Only someone inside could’ve done this!”

“WHO?!” roared a man with spike-pierced leg, fortune’s favor his only shield from heart-piercing death.

Guan Yu’s gaze swept faces. “Confess now, and I’ll let you leave. If I must dig you out…”

**Chapter 4821: Provoking Truth**

Chu Fan pleaded, “The Cao family used you! If deaths occurred, you’d take the blame alone. They’d deny knowing you!”

Still, silence.

Guan Yu pressed, “Fear holds your tongue. But know this—I’ll shutter this theater for years if needed to uncover you. Your nerves will crack. Your guilt will show.”

He studied each face, seeking tells. In this pre-forensic era, without fingerprints or cameras, psychology was his only tool. The stage’s wreckage offered scant clues beyond sawdust and twisted metal.

“Very well,” Guan Yu concluded. “Since none confess, we begin investigations. But remember—when caught, mercy vanishes.”

The troupe shifted uneasily, eyes darting. Somewhere among them, a traitor’s heartbeat quickened.
