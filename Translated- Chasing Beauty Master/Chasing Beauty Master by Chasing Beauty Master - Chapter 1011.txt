Everyone stood by the pile of bricks, waiting. The moment their opponents’ heads appeared over the wall, they’d start hurling bricks to smash skulls.

The four monks had naturally joined them to assist Guan Yu. Big Beard率先 grabbed a brick, snapped it in half with both hands, and growled, “Use them sparingly. Half a brick is enough to crack their heads. Heh heh heh.”

The others followed his example. Wei Hongwei watched Big Beard effortlessly break a brick and decided to try himself. Gripping a brick with both hands, he strained until his face contorted in pain. The brick remained intact. “Damn!” he cursed. “These things are so hard! How come you all break them so easily?”

Wei Hongwei, the pampered young master of a wealthy family, had never touched a brick in his life despite his father being in construction. Seeing others split bricks with ease, he’d assumed it was simple.

Yet when he tried, his hands throbbed while the brick stayed whole, prompting another stream of curses.

Big Beard chuckled and handed Wei Hongwei his two halves. “Use mine first.” Wei Hongwei eagerly accepted them, clutching the bricks tightly as he awaited heads appearing over the wall.

Outside, a human ladder had formed. Bodyguards slowly climbed toward the wall’s summit. The instant a forehead peeked over, Xue Jing casually flicked a brick.

“Agh!” A scream echoed as a bodyguard tumbled down. One after another, Xue Jing knocked down every climber.

Wei Hongwei exclaimed excitedly, “Hahaha! So this is why the boss told us to haul so many bricks in here! This is hilarious!”

After laughing himself breathless, he added, “Sister-in-law Xue Jing, could you slow down? These bricks in my hands are getting warm from holding them! Let me throw a couple when they come up again, okay?”

Xue Jing smiled and nodded. Guan Yu shook his head helplessly—Wei Hongwei was treating this life-and-death struggle like a game.

Young Master Feng had retreated far behind after ordering his men to scale the wall, fearing a stray brick might scar his pretty face.

The first wave of bodyguards lay defeated, their comrades exchanging fearful glances. None dared raise their heads again.

Young Master Feng roared from the rear, “You useless trash! Swarm the wall together! They’re just a handful—what’re you scared of with our numbers?”

Cowed by their master’s fury, the bodyguards launched another assault.

When heads reappeared, Xue Jing held back, glancing at Wei Hongwei. The young master laughed uproariously as he hurled his bricks.

Alas, whether from hunger or lingering effects of poison, Wei Hongwei’s first brick thudded harmlessly against the wall’s base. His second throw overshot completely, eliciting a distant “Holy shit!” from beyond the wall.

Now a dozen heads popped over simultaneously—these bodyguards seemed suicidally determined.

Seeing Wei Hongwei’s misses, Guan Yu smoothly flung his prepared bricks. Xue Jing and the monks followed suit.

**Chapter 2585: Thrown Out**

Both of Guan Yu’s half-bricks found their marks, smashing into faces with bone-crunching force—enough to incapacitate any recipient.

Though less accurate than Guan Yu, the monks outperformed Wei Hongwei. Big Beard grumbled, “Never thought brick-tossing required such skill—too much or too little force, and you miss...”

Shensheng advised, “Channel a wisp of inner qi into your palm. Each throw will drop them instantly.”

A brickstorm ensued. Within minutes, nearly thirty bodyguards fell with shattered faces.

Young Master Feng began panicking. They’d lost so many without even crossing the wall!

“Young Master!” A panting bodyguard reported, “They’ve got a mountain of bricks inside! Even with 200 men, we can’t withstand this!”

Fuming but helpless, Feng snapped, “All of you—attack together! Once someone gets inside, open the damn gate!”

“But sir—”

“Shut up! I want everyone on that wall now! Let’s see how many bricks their few hands can throw!”

Though seething, the bodyguards obeyed. Feng meanwhile called Bill Lin for reinforcements.

The next wave coordinated their ascent—counting to three before vaulting over simultaneously to overwhelm the defenders.

But bricks care nothing for strategy. Guan Yu and Xue Jing scored headshots with mechanical precision, though some invaders slipped through.

These trespassers fared worst. Big Beard abandoned brick-throwing to stride toward the wall, grabbing a bodyguard by the collar. Spinning like a discus thrower, he launched the man skyward.

“Aaaaaah!” The screaming projectile arced over the wall, crashing into the crowd below—taking out three men.

Terrified climbers lost their nerve, tumbling back down. Those remaining on the wall soon joined them, battered by incoming bricks.

“Hahaha! Take that, bastards!” Wei Hongwei cheered, thrilled at finally hitting someone.

The assault stalled again. Sweat-drenched bodyguards trembled—some collapsing before even peeking over, traumatized by seeing comrades become human missiles.

Wei Hongwei marveled, “Big Beard, you were incredible! Tossing people like ragdolls! I wish I had your strength!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Not in this lifetime. With your lazy lifestyle? Forget it.”

“Can’t you encourage me? I did hit one!”

“By wasting ten bricks? Stand aside—we need to conserve ammunition.”

Though blunt, Wei Hongwei took no offense. Under Guan Yu’s orders, he obediently retrieved his spent bricks from the wall’s base.

Big Beard helped gather the intact projectiles. Guan Yu scolded, “These are weapons, not toys! What’ll we do when they’re gone?”

Wei Hongwei grinned apologetically. “Sorry boss! I’ll stop—save them for you experts!”

Outside, bodyguards watched the sky like soldiers under artillery fire, flinching at every brick-shaped shadow. Most came from Wei Hongwei’s wild throws—others’ accuracy waned without inner energy support.

**Chapter 2586: Single Path**

Young Master Feng huddled in his distant car. Another report came: “Sir, over fifty wounded! We must retreat!”

Feng ground his teeth, watching bloodied men being loaded into vehicles. “Send the injured back first. Check for back entrances!”

After reconnaissance, the captain reported: “No other routes. This temple’s front platform clings to a cliff. Only one path up or down—unless they jump the waterfall or use helicopters.”

Feng’s eyes lit up. “So Guan Yu’s trapped! Unless he flies out, he must pass through us!”

Inside the courtyard, the defenders relaxed. A young monk brought water as they awaited the next assault.

Wei Hongwei gloated, “Those bodyguards picked the wrong enemy! Their heads are pulp now—they won’t dare return!”

Guan Yu shook his head. “They’ve still got 150 men. Stay vigilant.”

“You kept count? Amazing!” Wei Hongwei fawned as the monks regarded Guan Yu with new respect.

Big Beard noted departing vehicles. “Maybe they’re retreating?”

“No,” Guan Yu corrected. “Evacuating wounded. Feng won’t quit easily.”

Wei Hongwei gestured at their brick stockpile. “Unless Feng brings helicopters!”

“Exactly,” Guan Yu agreed. “The Bill family could easily send choppers.”

Feng indeed considered air support but worried about publicity. However, three martial artists arrived—reinforcements from Bill Lin.

“Young Master Feng,” their leader said through mirrored sunglasses, “how may we assist?”

Feng pointed eagerly at the temple. “Break in! Open that gate!”

The expert nodded. “Consider it done.”

As they approached, Feng fantasized about ransacking the temple. “Just wait—I’ll reduce this dump to rubble!”
