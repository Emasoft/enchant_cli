On Divine Stone Mountain, where the fragrant wind carried far, Guan Yu had already suspected that finding the Eight-Sided Drum Technique here would not be easy. Now, it seemed his fears were confirmed. Without properly mastering the direction, not only would they fail to locate the technique, but they might also fall into hidden traps, making escape nearly impossible once ensnared.

“There are people over there—likely those who entered with us,” Wang Jun said, his sharp eyes spotting figures on the distant mountainside.

Upon closer inspection, a group was indeed gathered there. Though their affiliation was unclear, they likely belonged to either the Red Lotus Sect or the Demon Soul Sect, given the presence of True Sun Sect members here.

Yet the True Sun Sect elder grew visibly anxious upon seeing others. Many of their disciples remained scattered, and he urgently needed to regroup them.

The elder spoke: “Guan Yu, your assistance has been invaluable on this journey. We owe you our gratitude. But with so many of our disciples still separated, I must now seek them out.” Privately, the elder harbored deeper concerns. Even if they located the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, claiming it with their current strength would prove difficult.

A direct confrontation with Guan Yu’s group alone would be challenging enough, let alone seizing the technique. Thus, the elder deemed it wiser to gather their scattered disciples first. Only by uniting their forces could they hope to secure the prize.

“Very well. We won’t detain you, Elder. Proceed as you must,” Guan Yu replied plainly.

With the elder’s departure, Guan Yu’s group dwindled to a dozen, including Wang Jun. The fate of the others mattered little to him—survival now rested in their own hands.

As the True Sun Sect elder led his men toward the distant figures, Guan Yu remained rooted in place.

He reasoned their arrival points had been randomized upon entering this realm. While some might have landed fortuitously near the mountain, his own group had been relegated to the periphery through ill luck.

Divine Stone Mountain, season of blossoms, fragrant wind carries far... Guan Yu silently pondered these phrases. Though flowers now blanketed the slopes, their arrangement defied logical patterns.

The gentle breeze carried undeniable sweetness, but where could the Eight-Sided Drum Technique lie? “Fragrant wind carries far”—did this hint at following the wind’s direction? The current westward flow from left to right indeed bore floral scents.

“Guan Yu, which way now?” Aze pressed impatiently.

Turning, Guan Yu observed the wind’s path toward a verdant, flowerless slope. Yet intuition pulled him toward that very direction.

“There. This breeze truly qualifies as ‘fragrant wind.’ I believe we should follow its course rather than focus on these flowered slopes. What do you think?”

Chapter 4628: The Search Continues

None objected. Aze declared, “Let’s investigate then. Better than wasting time here. If wrong, we can always retreat.”

The logic held. With no clearer clues, they followed Guan Yu’s interpretation toward the mountain, hoping to find mystical stones or other signs.

The deceptive distance stretched longer in practice. Guan Yu warned, “Stay vigilant as we ascend. Watch for beastly ambushes.”

Though their journey had been uneventful, Guan Yu sensed lurking dangers. While undaunted by powerful creatures, such encounters would waste precious time.

“Why not fly to the summit?” Siqi suggested. “It’s faster.”

“No. Our goal isn’t the peak but clues,” Guan Yu countered. “We must search meticulously. Moreover, flight might attract powerful beasts. Conserve spiritual energy—battles await later.”

The grueling climb proceeded through pathless slopes dense with knee-high grass. Wang Jun ingeniously borrowed a comrade’s Qingyun Sword to clear vegetation, preventing further twisted ankles like one disciple’s mishap earlier.

Near midday, rumbling echoes startled the group. “What’s that noise?” Aze tensed, scanning for beasts.

Wang Jun tilted his head. “A waterfall, perhaps?”

Recalling the river near Miao City, Guan Yu nodded. “Plausible. Let’s press on—we seek uniqueness, not ordinary terrain.”

The Eight-Sided Drum Technique wouldn’t be buried randomly. Ancestor Menghua’s cunning demanded a significant hiding place, designed to spark conflict among seekers.

Wang Jun added, “Let’s check the waterfall. Perhaps drinkable water awaits.”

Though not desperately thirsty, the group welcomed the prospect. Approaching thunderous cascades, they navigated treacherous undergrowth until fragrant winds intensified oddly.

“Notice the stronger scent here?” Guan Yu observed.

“It’s been increasing since the foothills,” Siqi confirmed. “From pleasant to overwhelming—illogical as we distance from flowered slopes.”

Guan Yu’s conviction grew. “We’re close. The technique must be nearby.”

“People fighting below!” Wang Jun interrupted.

Through dense foliage, Guan Yu climbed a tree to witness clashing factions by a cliffside waterfall. “Red Lotus Sect and Demon Soul Sect at it again,” he reported.

“How’d they arrive so quickly?” Aze grumbled.

Chapter 4629: Holding Position

Frustration rippled through the group. Guan Yu reasoned, “Entry points were random. They might have spawned here directly.”

“Unfair!” Aze fumed.

“Fairness doesn’t exist here,” Guan Yu said. “Even if they claim the technique, we’d be powerless.”

Wang Jun offered perspective: “Others might’ve landed in Miao City’s heart—devoured by demons. We’re fortunate.”

Guan Yu redirected: “Let’s observe their battle. Wang Jun, you’re right—we’re too numerous. I’ll scout alone.”

“I’m coming,” Siqi insisted. Wang Jun and Aze joined despite Guan Yu’s protests. He instructed remaining disciples to wait.

Approaching stealthily, they witnessed the Demon Soul Sect’s Right Envoy whirling his Soul-Devouring Whip. A crimson ring materialized midair, coalescing into a blazing phoenix whose mere presence cowed Red Lotus disciples.

Only Elder Zhao stood firm, brandishing a talisman-like paper. As the phoenix unleashed fiery projectiles, Zhao conjured an earthen barrier protecting his sect.

“Prepare Heavenly Water Formation!” Zhao barked. Regrouping disciples channeled combined spiritual energy—a testament to sect unity magnifying individual weaknesses.

Chapter 4630: Clash of Forces

The Right Envoy’s phoenix represented extraordinary cultivation—a semi-sentient construct surpassing ordinary elemental magic. Guan Yu marveled, recalling Xiao Rong’s tales of her sect’s unique arts.

As flaming feathers battered the shield, Guan Yu noted the coordinated counterattack. While individual Red Lotus members appeared mediocre, their combined formation radiated formidable power—a reminder of sect strengths lying in unity rather than lone heroes.
