Upon learning that Qiaoqiao was Guan Yu’s girlfriend, Wang Wu’s demeanor instantly transformed into that of a fawning dog. With an ingratiating smile, he said, “We’ve already assessed the patient’s condition. The previous high fever triggered myocardial endocarditis and cardiac damage, necessitating a heart repair surgery. Of course, if you prefer not to proceed with the operation, our hospital won’t insist.”

Lin Qiaoqiao asked coldly, “Is this heart condition solely caused by the high fever?”

“This isn’t a simple illness but a chronic condition. The patient likely had preexisting heart issues, and the prolonged high fever exacerbated the problem. Without surgery, the patient may survive but will remain at high risk of sudden cardiac death.”

After Wang Wu’s explanation, everyone gasped in shock. The severity of the situation made the surgery seem unavoidable.

Lin Qiaoqiao pressed further, “If the diagnosis is clear, why delay? Shouldn’t the surgery be done as soon as possible? Or is this deliberate procrastination to burden us psychologically? If so, the hospital bears full responsibility.”

“Ah, you misunderstand!” Wang Wu protested with a pained expression. “The patient is still undergoing routine examinations. Several tests remain incomplete, so we can’t proceed yet.”

“If it’s a heart issue, why order irrelevant tests?” Lin Qiaoqiao retorted. “What’s the point of checking for intestinal problems? This seems intentional.”

**Chapter 3,226: I Don’t Believe It**

Wang Wu grew visibly frustrated. Despite his earnest efforts to treat Guan Yu’s acquaintance, he now faced unwarranted accusations.

“You’re mistaken. These tests are essential,” he insisted. “As Mr. Guan’s girlfriend, how dare I deceive you? Cardiac surgery is unlike other procedures. We must ensure all bodily functions are stabilized and meet surgical criteria before proceeding.”

After his lengthy explanation, Lin Qiaoqiao seemed to grasp the reasoning. “So these tests determine whether the patient’s body can withstand surgery?”

“Precisely. If other health issues are detected, the heart surgery cannot proceed until they’re resolved. While the operation itself isn’t highly risky, we prioritize safety above all.”

Nodding in understanding, Lin Qiaoqiao replied, “Thank you for your diligence, Dr. Wang. Please continue to care for him in my absence.”

“Of course. Feel free to consult me anytime,” Wang Wu said before tactfully excusing himself.

Now aware of the hospital’s protocols, Lin Qiaoqiao mused that while the extensive tests might seem excessive, they were mandatory steps. Without them, surgery would be denied, and any complications could spell disaster.

Turning to the family, she reassured them with a smile, “You heard the doctor. The surgery is low-risk with high success rates. Just complete the remaining tests and await the procedure.”

Her aunt murmured, “We’re already grateful. Guan Yu has covered all expenses. I don’t know how to thank him.”

“No need for thanks,” Lin Qiaoqiao said proudly. “The money he spent here is less than what he earns in an hour.”

Xiao Zhu, her mouth smeared with chocolate, scoffed, “Earning that much in an hour? You’re exaggerating, cousin! I don’t believe it. Stop glorifying Brother-in-law.”

“Why would I need to exaggerate?” Lin Qiaoqiao countered. “You’ve seen how he spends without hesitation—buying a car worth hundreds of thousands, paying 200,000 upfront for hospitalization. Does that sound like empty praise?”

Xiao Zhu pondered this. She’d always known Guan Yu was capable but never imagined his wealth. “So he’s super rich? No wonder you’re so fond of him. What woman wouldn’t adore a wealthy man?”

Lin Qiaoqiao frowned, realizing her efforts to elevate Guan Yu’s status had backfired into shallow appraisal.

Her aunt inquired, “Qiaoqiao, what does Guan Yu actually do? He seems idle yet earns so much.”

“He’s the chairman of Huayu Group,” Lin Qiaoqiao explained. “You might not have heard of it, but it’s a massive conglomerate involved in countless projects.”

“What’s a ‘group’? Is it something edible?” her uncle asked innocently. Having grown up in a remote village with little education, such terms were foreign to him.

Lin Qiaoqiao chuckled. “A group combines multiple industries—manufacturing, processing, etc. It’s a large corporation that expands into a conglomerate.”

Though still confused, her uncle refrained from further questions, knowing elaboration would only bewilder him more.

**Chapter 3,227: One-Third**

As lunchtime approached, her aunt offered, “Stay and eat with us, Qiaoqiao. We can order delivery.”

Lin Qiaoqiao agreed, while Xiao Zhu declared, “I’ll skip lunch. I have chocolates, chips, and biscuits to finish!”

“You should eat proper meals,” her aunt chided. “Save the snacks for later.”

“But they’ll go stale!” Xiao Zhu argued. The family relented, indulging her whims.

When asked about work, Lin Qiaoqiao admitted she’d taken leave, preoccupied with personal matters. She contemplated visiting Yunqing Sect to find Guan Yu but hesitated due to the journey’s risks and lack of communication.

Time flew as Yunqing Sect’s Six Peaks Assembly neared. Disciples from all peaks gathered at Tiger’s Head Peak, though the event would occur on a floating platform linking the peaks—a structure befitting the sect’s celestial grandeur.

The platform buzzed with activity as sparring arenas were erected. During the two-day preliminaries, disciples would duel across multiple stages. The final eight would compete on the third day, drawing the entire sect’s attention.

Meanwhile, the six Peak Masters convened to discuss sect affairs—primarily strategies against demonic factions.

Guan Yu, having endured days of poor meals, grew desperate. Despite Xuan Ming’s promise to improve the dining hall, nothing changed. One evening, hunger drove him to hunt in the forbidden forest bordering Gathering Peak.

Remembering the woods’ abundance of game, he ventured out at dusk. The forest, off-limits to disciples, supposedly housed dangers—likely due to its aggressive beasts. Cultivators, skilled in spells but vulnerable in close combat, avoided it.

Guan Yu, undeterred, slipped into the woods with a dagger, preferring physical combat over magical reliance. The forest spanned a third of Tiger’s Head Peak’s perimeter. Memories surfaced of his first visit with Siqi, where they’d encountered three mysterious figures.

Quietly foraging, he stumbled upon a clearing with remnants of a past campfire—charred wood and animal bones. “A kindred spirit,” he mused, assembling a tripod for roasting.

Yet his hunt proved challenging. Hours passed without sight of prey until a flash of white darted past—a large hare. After a relentless chase through the trees, Guan Yu finally speared it with his dagger.

Victorious but disoriented, he realized he’d strayed deep into the woods. Navigating by moonlight, he spotted a familiar glimmer—a staff’s glowing orb, like the one wielded by the黑衣人 (black-clad figures) he’d seen before.

Creeping closer, he overheard their conversation:

“The Six Peaks Assembly begins tomorrow. Are the preparations complete?” asked the staff-bearer.

“Yes,” replied a voice unmistakably belonging to a sect insider. “Once the Peak Masters gather, my agents at Front Return Peak will signal you.”

The infiltrator suggested, “Wouldn’t it be safer to let me reach the top four in the tournament? With the sect’s trust, our plans would advance smoother.”

The staff-bearer hesitated. “Do you doubt tomorrow’s success?”

**Chapter 3,228: Black-Clad Figures**

Guan Yu crouched silently, piecing together the conspiracy. The traitor within Yunqing Sect aimed to sabotage the assembly, colluding with external forces. As the黑衣人的 plot unfolded, Guan Yu knew he had to act—but first, he needed to escape the forest undetected, roast his hare, and warn the sect before dawn.
