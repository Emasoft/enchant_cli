Chapter 1266: She Belongs to Us

Guan Yu particularly loathed when people demanded he guess their identities. To him, this was utterly idiotic – did they truly believe themselves so renowned that others should perpetually speculate?

"Heh. For nameless nobodies like you, I neither care nor wish to know."

"If you don't care, then scram! Standing here begging for death?"

Unperturbed by their shouting, Guan Yu maintained his faint smile. "Though indifferent to you, that doesn't extend to her." He gestured at the black-clad woman behind him. "Bullying a defenseless woman – what honor is there in that? Leave now before my patience for bloodshed wears thin."

"Bully her? Brat! How could we bully her? She's our—"

Before the man could finish, the woman cried out: "Yes! They've chased me hundreds of miles! Won't stop till I collapse!"

"You see?" Guan Yu spread his hands. "When accounts differ, I naturally side with the vulnerable."

The men's patience snapped. One growled, "Foolish whelp! Since you court death, we'll oblige. Clearly you've never faced the Dark Mercenary Alliance's wrath!"

"Dark Mercenary Alliance?" Guan Yu's smile turned predatory. "What serendipity. I hadn't planned true violence, but now..."

Mid-leap, six azure blades of light shot from his hands towards the men.

"Mage?!"

Their eyes widened. This unremarkable youth being a mage defied expectation – human spellcasters were rarities, unlike the magic-saturated elven kin.

"Fear not!" another shouted. "Azure denotes low-tier magic! If this is his best, he's doomed!"

Guan Yu nodded inwardly. At least one understood magical hierarchies.

In arcane realms, four chromatic tiers existed: verdant, azure, violet, and amber. Though incapable of violet spells yet, azure sufficed for these vermin. Even without magic, his Nascent Soul cultivation could challenge elite warriors.

But he'd underestimated two Great Swordsmen among them – formidable figures in provincial towns. Yet within five exchanges, their confidence crumbled. Guan Yu's azure spells carried triple potency!

After fifteen minutes, six broken mercenaries lay groaning. Guan Yu spared them – no personal grudge existed, and his rescued damsel's virtue remained questionable.

Speaking of which – where was she? The black-clad woman had vanished!

Guan Yu snorted. Risking life for her rescue, and she slips away without thanks!

"Listen well," he told the crippled men. "I spare you today. Should I witness further harassment of innocents..." He drew a finger across his throat before departing.

Once distant, one mercenary groaned, "Dozens lost tracking Lady Yue'er. The Alliance Master will flay us alive!"

"Who predicted this lunatic's interference? Low-tier spells wielded like violet-grade!"

"Seems he bears old grudges against us. Investigate thoroughly!"

"Grudges... Gods! If he discovers Lady Yue'er is the Master's daughter—"

"Shut your crow's beak!"

Guan Yu's mood lifted post-battle. His magical control had sharpened. No longer obsessed with high-tier spells, he sought profundity in every technique.

After three hours' travel, forest gave way to bustling markets.

"So the Elven Woods border humanity so closely," he mused. "Half-day's march for invasion."

But hunger overrode geopolitics. Counting Elder Allen's gifted coins – barely a hundred. Local prices proved exorbitant: ten gold for a roasted fowl! At this rate, three days' funds must last till the full moon's Crystal Toad emergence.

"That tightfisted elf!" Guan Yu cursed through chicken grease. Thirty more coins secured lodgings, leaving him half-penniless. He collapsed onto bedding, exhaustion claiming him.

Chapter 1267: Reunion

"Ah, wealth's comforts!" Guan Yu stretched luxuriously. "Beds surpass forest floors."

Dusk found him awakened by commotion below. Descending, he found the innkeeper refusing a black-clad girl: "One gold won't buy a crust! Don't make this hard!"

"But sir! Abandon a maiden to streets? Have you no daughter?"

As the girl turned pleading eyes upward, she pointed at Guan Yu: "He'll pay!"

Recognition struck – the vanished rescuee!

"Did I agree to this?" Guan Yu glared. "What's our relation?"

The girl's eyes brimmed theatrically. "So this is how you discard me? Chasing you here despite your new lover..."

Innkeeper's glare turned accusatory. "Youth! Treasure such devotion! At sixty, I rue my own philandering..."

"Enough!" Guan Yu surrendered. "I'll pay."

The girl's tears vanished instantly. "Thanks, neighbor!"

"Neighbor?!"

As she claimed the adjacent room, Guan Yu plotted: "Must find Crystal Toad clues fast. The Murong Clan seeks it too. Infiltrate their manor tonight."

His door burst open. "Thank you! I'd have perished without you!"

"Ever heard of knocking?!" Guan Yu crouched defensively.

The girl giggled. "Guilty conscience? I'm Xia Yue'er. Call me Yue'er."

"Guan Yu. Answer truthfully – why were they chasing you?"

Yue'er's gaze shifted. "Oh! Your magic! First human mage I've seen!"

"Don't deflect! Answer or I cancel your room!"

"Fine!" She pouted. "They're villains, as you saw..."

Guan Yu abandoned interrogation, only for her to whisper: "I'm hungry..."

Chapter 1268: Thrashing Thugs

Market stalls overflowed with delicacies. Yue'er's eyes sparkled at spiced beef skewers. Twenty gold vanished for ten sticks.

"Yu-gege, what's wrong?" She licked grease from fingers.

Guan Yu's remaining fifty coins evaporated at a trinket shop. Yue'er clasped a bauble. "See? Exact price!"

"Now penniless! What tomorrow?"

Yue'er smiled impishly. "Where carts reach mountains, roads appear!"

Three thugs blocked their return. "Pretty lady! Entertain us?"

Before Guan Yu reacted, Yue'er kicked a groin, elbowed ribs, and smashed a nose – three men collapsed howling.

She dusted her hands. "Hungry makes Yue'er irritable."

Guan Yu stared. This "defenseless maiden" moved like seasoned warrior!
