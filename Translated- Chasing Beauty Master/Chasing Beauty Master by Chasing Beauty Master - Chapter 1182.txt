“You don’t understand, do you?” Lin Qiaoqiao glanced at Guan Yu with a smile. “This is part of our local wedding customs. When a man comes to claim his bride, he must first wash his hands in a copper basin before entering the bride’s home. The red cloth in the water symbolizes the handkerchief of the woman he’s marrying—it’s for the man to dry his hands. That’s the general idea.”

“But this is just a martial competition, not an actual wedding. Isn’t washing hands now a bit too premature?” Guan Yu asked.

“Of course not,” Lin Qiaoqiao replied. “Every challenger must wash their hands before stepping onto the stage. The victor will be considered the bride’s betrothed. Washing hands first shows respect and acknowledgment to the bride’s family. The red cloth also signifies the bride’s lifelong devotion to serving her husband obediently.”

Guan Yu mused that this place was indeed steeped in feudal traditions, where men held far higher status than women. Unlike the egalitarian cities, women here became little more than subservient caretakers after marriage.

Lin Qiaoqiao added, “Guan Yu, I realized something serious last night. The Li family—Li Gui won’t let this go easily. What should we do?”

“Logically, even if Li Gui shows up today, his third-rate skills won’t secure a victory. Why worry? Unless his father plans to fight in his stead?” Guan Yu countered.

“That’s not the issue. I’m afraid he’s bribed many participants. If that happens, things could get messy,” Lin Qiaoqiao fretted.

Gone was the “Brother Li Gui” she had affectionately called the night before.

“Can he hire a proxy fighter? Isn’t that against the rules of a martial competition for marriage?” Guan Yu asked, puzzled. Traditionally, the victor claimed the bride, making substitutions nonsensical.

Lin Qiaoqiao explained, “Technically, it’s forbidden, but loopholes exist. Wealthy men who lack skill hire fighters to win on their behalf. After victory, the groom feigns illness during the wedding and ‘gifts’ the bride to his brother or cousin. Understand?”

Guan Yu nodded. “In that case, rest assured—I won’t let you marry anyone else.”

His confidence stemmed from Jinyu Zilang lying in wait. If needed, the elite fighter would intervene.

Even if Li Gui hired formidable fighters, Jinyu Zilang could crush them all. Had Lin Qiaoqiao mentioned this earlier, Guan Yu might have slept better.

“Really? You can defeat everyone?” Lin Qiaoqiao’s eyes sparkled.

“Absolutely. I never boast,” Guan Yu vowed. She trusted him implicitly.

From the predawn hours until 8:18 AM—the auspicious time chosen by Lin Zhonggeng—preparations buzzed. Fireworks were primed, and the Lin estate swarmed with hundreds of spectators, including villagers and neighboring townsfolk drawn by the Lin family’s prestige.

Young men eager to win Lin Qiaoqiao’s hand crowded the grounds, though many lacked the skill to compete. As the clock neared 8:18, Lin Zhonggeng, clad in a formal black tunic, took the stage.

“Today marks my daughter’s martial competition for marriage!” he announced, outlining rules: no hidden weapons, poisons, or personal arms. Contestants must use the inspected weapons provided—over a hundred varieties lined the stage.

Fireworks erupted, filling the air with sulfurous smoke. When the haze cleared, an elderly man declared, “Let the competition begin! Contestants, wash your hands and step forward!”

The first challenger, a fortyish-looking man with a Wu Dalang-esque stature (despite being only twenty-six), provoked jeers. His hunchbacked gait and mute gestures of thanks drew ridicule, but he met the age criteria.

Another contender—a pockmarked farmer with grime under his nails—chose a spear, as did the dwarf. The mismatch was laughable: the dwarf’s spear nearly matched his height. Yet, to everyone’s shock, the dwarf swiftly overpowered the farmer, sending him crashing offstage.

Guan Yu smirked at Lin Qiaoqiao’s mortified expression. She shot him a mock-threatening glare as more fighters stepped up.

Lin Zhonggeng had initially planned to hire a champion, but Guan Yu argued against it. “If no one defeats your champion, your daughter appears unmarriageable,” Lin Zhonggeng had worried. Guan Yu rolled his eyes at the village’s obsession with face.

As the dwarf and farmer clashed, Guan Yu noted the absurdity. The dwarf’s skill outshone his comical appearance, while the farmer’s brute strength proved futile. When the dwarf’s spear struck the farmer’s ribs, the crowd winced.

“Winner declared!” the elder shouted. “Next challengers, come forth!”

Guan Yu shook his head. These desperate suitors, lured by Lin Qiaoqiao’s beauty, deserved their bruises.
