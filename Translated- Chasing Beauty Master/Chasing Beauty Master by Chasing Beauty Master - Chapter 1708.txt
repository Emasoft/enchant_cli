“Given your youth and marriage to a wealthy old man, you’ve never lacked food or finery. Why resort to such deeds? Trampling on lives so carelessly—is this fitting?” Guan Yu inquired calmly, his demeanor belying the monstrous acts before him—acts surpassing even banditry in cruelty.

“You’re right. Since marrying here, I’ve wanted for nothing. I did it…for amusement. I never meant to kill anyone. I didn’t intentionally harm people like that,” Shi Zhenxiang replied.

“Enough talk. It’s time to return and settle this matter. If we delay further, my senior brothers will reduce the bun shop to rubble,” Guan Yu said, gesturing for her to follow.

“You won’t escape today. Cooperate quietly,” he added when she hesitated.

Shi Zhenxiang hadn’t anticipated such ill fortune—nor that they’d predicted her flight and lain in wait. Defiant, she demanded, “How did you know I’d come here?”

“We awaited you. Flee north or south, and our men would intercept you. Return with us, lest you bring greater calamity upon others,” Guan Yu stated.

Unwilling to comply, Shi Zhenxiang deployed a woman’s timeless weapon—suddenly simpering in a saccharine tone: “Handsome sir, show mercy! Let me go! If the old man learns of this, he’ll beat me to death! Returning means ruin—please pity me!”

Guan Yu arched an amused brow, though her act repelled him. A sweet, innocent maiden’s coquetry might charm, but from this black-hearted schemer? It curdled his stomach. Not every woman could wield such arts.

Take Zhang Han or Jin Hua—petite, genuinely endearing. Zhang Han’s pouts could melt resolve. But this venomous creature’s affectations? Revolting.

“Speak properly,” he chided. “Releasing you risks countless others. You’re selfish, wicked—I won’t relent. Come quietly. I’d rather not force you.”

“Then…a bargain!” Shi Zhenxiang adjusted tactics, noting his disgust. “Take all silver I’ve recently acquired. Spare me—I beg you!”

“‘Recently’?” Guan Yu echoed, probing. “So my senior brother isn’t your only victim. How many have you preyed upon?”

“Not many! It’s less dire than you think.” She produced a bundle. “Your brother’s belongings—a 500-tael note, 200 taels in coin, a jade pendant. Take them!”

As she displayed Lin Chen’s possessions, Guan Yu noted her pack brimmed with pilfered treasures.

“Return these, accept my apologies, and let me go! I never realized you were Yunqing Sect disciples!” She gauged his stony expression and sweetened the pot: “Two gold ingots more—compensation and medical fees. Leave me some traveling funds. How else shall I survive?”

**Chapter 4468: Don’t Be Afraid**

Guan Yu unapologetically claimed the silver note, coin pouch, and gold. “I’ll accept these…but you’re still coming.”

“Liars! Is this Yunqing Sect’s honor?” Shi Zhenxiang shrilled.

“You misunderstand,” Guan Yu countered coolly. “I never promised freedom. You offered payment unprompted. We don’t need silver—we need you.”

“Why torment me after taking everything?” she wailed, heart bleeding at her pilfered hoard.

“Fear not. Payment is received, but resolution awaits. Come peacefully, or the bun shop suffers,” interjected Siqi.

Resigned, Shi Zhenxiang trudged back. Better the devil she knew than wilderness exile. Yunqing disciples kept their word, surely? As for the old man—a tearful tale would suffice.

**Chapter 4469: Disbelief**

“Enough delays!” roared Ling Su within the bun shop, brandishing his Yunqing Sword. “I’ll raze this hovel!”

“Halt!” Guan Yu’s entrance froze the scene. All turned, bewildered by his return with Shi Zhenxiang.

“Calm yourselves. The culprit is here. Let us deliberate,” Guan Yu announced.

Ling Su seethed—his scheme to pocket Lin Chen’s silver foiled again by Guan Yu. “Where’d you find her?”

“Matter settled. She admits harming Lin Chen, returned his possessions with extra for his care. No need for violence.”

The old proprietor glared at his concubine. “You did this? You’d ruin us?”

“Don’t blame me!” Shi Zhenxiang launched her rehearsed defense, tears glistening. “Last night at Sister’s Inn, Lin Chen forced himself on me! I had to drug him! He…groped me, said vile things! I took his silver in anger, had him dumped at the graveyard—just to frighten him!”

Her performance almost convinced Guan Yu—Lin Chen’s lechery was legend. But Ling Su snorted: “Lies! I witnessed your scheme—luring him, spiking wine, stripping him naked for plunder!”

The old man recoiled. “You…you plotted this? For silver?”

“Never! Believe me!” she clung to him, sobbing.

Guan Yu intervened: “She’s preyed on many. That pack holds loot beyond your gifts, old sir.”

Snatching her bundle, the proprietor gaped at spilled riches—gold, jewels, stolen finery. “Why? You wanted for nothing!”

Defiant now, Shi Zhenxiang sneered: “I relish ruining men! You gave trinkets, never coin! I’m no pet!”

The proprietor trembled, heartbroken. Guan Yu shook his head—here stood remorseless malice, veiled in beauty. Justice, not mercy, was due.
