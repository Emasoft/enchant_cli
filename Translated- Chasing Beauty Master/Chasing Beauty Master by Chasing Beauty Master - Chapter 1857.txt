**Chapter 4881: Let’s Talk This Through Calmly**

Knowing that Madam Qin had always doted on Qu Hua (Melodic Splendor), her favored nephew, and that he had now suffered injuries, she would inevitably seek her husband’s aid. However, Mr. Qin had long been reluctant to involve himself in Qu Hua’s affairs. The young man had grown accustomed to throwing his weight around in the capital under the Qin family’s banner, and this recklessness had finally borne bitter fruit—an outcome Mr. Qin had foreseen.

When Madam Qin entered the room, her face was dark with fury. Though she often domineered over the servants, she rarely dared raise her voice in her husband’s presence, always gauging his mood before acting.

This time, not only had Qu Hua been gravely injured, but the Qin family’s reputation had also been tarnished. This matter could not be brushed aside lightly.

“Madam, you seem rather pale. What’s the matter? Are you unwell? Should we summon a physician to examine you in case of illness?” Mr. Qin feigned ignorance, his tone deliberately casual.

He had recently returned from a business trip with his son, Qin Huan, who had retired to his chambers to rest after the journey’s fatigue.

“Husband, you must uphold our family’s honor! Today, the Qin name has been dragged through the mud!” Madam Qin swiftly shed her shrewish demeanor, adopting the pitiable air of a wronged child seeking parental justice. Her wrinkled face contorted with exaggerated sorrow.

“Madam, your concerns are mine. How could I not act? But you must explain clearly: Where did this disgrace occur? How has our family been humiliated? Only then can I decide our course.” Mr. Qin replied pointedly, adding, “I heard you visited the temple today. Did something happen there?”

He deliberately avoided mentioning Qu Hua, though he knew full well the details of the incident. Mr. Qin had never held the young man in high regard. Despite being raised in the Qin household, Qu Hua’s affairs had seldom warranted his attention.

Under Madam Qin’s indulgence, Qu Hua had at least shown restraint within the family, always deferring to Qin Huan’s primacy. Had he dared compete with Qin Huan for favor, Mr. Qin would have expelled him long ago.

Madam Qin knelt abruptly, wailing as if mourning a death. “Husband, Qu Hua was beaten in public! Thirty of our guards were routed! How can this be trivial?”

“I’ve only just returned and heard fragments of this. Enlighten me: Who in the capital would dare assault so many under our banner?” Mr. Qin pressed, his act meticulous.

“Qu Hua lies bedridden with severe injuries! The physicians fear the worst—he may never recover!” Madam Qin burst into theatrical sobs, her performance masterfully convincing.

“Tears solve nothing. We are people of standing—compose yourself.” Mr. Qin chided. “If necessary, I’ll request an Imperial Physician from the palace. They’ll surely find a remedy.”

In truth, Mr. Qin remained unclear on the extent of Qu Hua’s injuries, but his wife’s dramatics suggested grave harm.

“Qu Hua is the last of my family’s line! Even if he fathers but one child, our blood must continue! Now, with him so broken…” Madam Qin wept harder, though her true fear lay elsewhere: had Qu Hua’s manhood been damaged, rendering him useless?

Mr. Qin’s offer to summon an Imperial Physician was an extraordinary concession. Such royal intervention might aid recovery, even if the injury’s nature remained too shameful to disclose.

“Enough formalities. Rise—we are family.” Mr. Qin commanded.

Madam Qin stood, sniffling. While the physician matter was settled, vengeance remained.

“Husband, the culprit—Wan Hong—not only assaulted our men but openly mocked the Qin family’s might! He spat on our dignity!”

“Wan Hong? I’ve heard the name vaguely. Recount the events precisely.”

“According to Qu Hua, a minor dispute at Wanyang Restaurant escalated. Wan Hong possesses martial skill—Qu Hua stood no chance. When we sent thirty guards to arrest him, Wan Hong defeated them all single-handedly, deriding our household as ‘a nest of incompetents’!”

Madam Qin spat venom, inflating Wan Hong’s insults. “The entire capital witnessed this humiliation!”

“Why would Wan Hong target Qu Hua specifically? As the foremost of the capital’s Four Great Families, we must uphold reason. What provoked him?” Mr. Qin probed, demanding the truth.

“I know not! But Wan Hong clearly seeks to provoke us! He must be punished!” Madam Qin resumed weeping.

**Chapter 4882: Don’t Blame Others**

“Enough!” Mr. Qin’s roar silenced his wife. “Your coddling ruins Qu Hua! The Qus’ indulgence will be his undoing!”

The Qin family, though assertive, maintained decorum unlike the lawless Caos. Reputation governed Mr. Qin’s decisions—a principle Qu Hua’s antics had long threatened.

Had Qin Huan been wronged, Mr. Qin would have mobilized instantly. For Qu Hua, indifference reigned.

“Foolish woman!” Mr. Qin glared. “Qu Hua accosted a maiden at Wanyang Restaurant! His assailants were the girls themselves! Should I, head of the Qin, seek vengeance against women? Absurd!”

Madam Qin paled. Unbeknownst to her, her husband possessed the full account—details even Qu Hua had withheld.

She knew Qu Hua’s history of harassing women, shielded by the Qin name. But this time, consequences had followed.

“Even if Qu Hua erred, the brutality was excessive! And Wan Hong’s assault on our guards cannot stand!” she ventured meekly.

“Had Qu Hua not transgressed, and you not dispatched those guards, would this fiasco exist?” Mr. Qin retorted. Still, thirty defeated guards shamed the Qins. Reckless retaliation risked greater folly without understanding Wan Hong’s backing.

“This matter ends here. I’ve pressing affairs. Leave.” Mr. Qin dismissed her.

Cowed, Madam Qin departed. Her husband’s wrath could shake the capital—defiance was unthinkable. Yet fury simmered within her. If the Qins wouldn’t act, she would.

She summoned trusted aides, ordering investigations into Wan Hong’s whereabouts. Thirty men failed? Send sixty. Sixty? A hundred. No three-headed demon could withstand such force.

**Chapter 4883: A Reasonable Point**

Shortly after Madam Qin’s exit, Mr. Qin received unexpected daytime visitors—the Cao family patriarch. Though allies, public meetings risked exposure.

In his study, Mr. Qin greeted Mr. Cao tersely. “Why risk daylight visits? Our pact requires discretion!”

“Apologies, Elder Qin. I ensured secrecy. But urgent news: Wan Hong assaulted your nephew. What do you know of him?”

“Little. Your nephew Cao was similarly beaten. Have your inquiries yielded anything?”

“Nothing. ‘Wan Hong’ appears false. No major clans bear that name. His face matches no known martial sects.”

“An alias, then. What’s his purpose here?”

Mr. Cao leaned forward. “Could he be Jiang Yuankai’s agent?”

Mr. Qin pondered. “Unlikely. He gifted Jiang Xin the East Sea Dragon Pearl at the auction—a lavish boon to Jiang Yuankai. Later, he attacked your nephew defending Jiang’s honor. Jiang wouldn’t sabotage his own allies.”

“The East Sea Dragon Pearl…” Mr. Cao’s eyes gleamed. “Legends say its treasure could buy nations. If we obtained it…”

Mr. Qin nodded. “Yet Princess Chang reportedly gifted it to the Emperor.”

“A ruse!” Mr. Qin scoffed. “No woman—least that avaricious princess—would relinquish such a jewel. They feigned donation to protect Jiang Xin. The pearl remains with her.”

“Brilliant!” Mr. Cao exclaimed. “Then our path is clear—seize it from the princess!”

“Madness!” Mr. Qin warned. “The Imperial Son-in-Law’s residence is impregnable. One misstep, and our legacies crumble!”

The two schemed on, unaware their ambitions would soon collide with Wan Hong’s enigmatic purpose—a storm gathering over the capital’s gilded towers.
