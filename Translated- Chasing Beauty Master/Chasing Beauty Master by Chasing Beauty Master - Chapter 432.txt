In his view, the Li family's influence in China was so formidable that no one dared refuse them. Moreover, Li Zekai himself had come today, already showing Guan Yu immense face. Yet Guan Yu dared ask "why" – clearly an act of ingratitude!

Guan Yu sneered coldly, “President Li, control your lapdog!”

“You…” The man surged to his feet in rage, but before he could fully stand, Li Zekai viciously kicked him. “Get out,” he said tonelessly.

“President, I…” The subordinate remained bewildered about his offense.

“OUT!” Seeing Li Zekai’s genuine anger, the man slunk away shamefaced.

“My apologies for poor discipline,” Li Zekai said with a slight bow.

Li Zekai hadn’t come to pressure Guan Yu with his family’s influence. He wasn’t foolish – if Guan Yu feared the Li family, he wouldn’t openly challenge the Song clan.

After expelling the incompetent underling, Li Zekai declared, “Guan Yu, consider this visit a peace offering. You may refuse, but I announce today the Li family withdraws from this conflict.”

His words stunned even Dongfang Mu and Jiang Ziqi. Prepared for confrontation, they never expected Li Zekai’s surrender.

Yet Guan Yu showed no surprise.

He understood the Li family’s involvement had been peripheral. Had Li Zekai or Li Zejia truly mobilized their main forces, Guan Yu’s current capabilities couldn’t withstand them.

From his Hong Kong experience, Guan Yu knew the Li branch there under Li Zilong was merely collateral kin.

**Chapter 1080: Rejecting the Li Family’s Demand**

With Li Feng’s assistance in Hong Kong – whose family rivalled the Zejia faction – Li Zekai’s approach became clear. The Zejia Group juggled acquisitions in the British Empire, aiding the Song family against Guan Yu, while countering Dihao International’s Hong Kong maneuvers. Even a lion wearies fighting three fronts.

Abandoning the least profitable front was logical. The Guan Yu conflict brought the Lis no real benefit. Crucially, unlike the Song family’s political obsessions, the Lis sensed impending government moves against the Songs. Hence their withdrawal.

“Your withdrawal can’t be unconditional,” Guan Yu observed. “State your terms.”

“Naturally.” Li Zekai smiled. “Stay out of our Dihao International conflict.”

“Agreed.” Both Dihao and Zejia were behemoths beyond Guan Yu’s current reach. He’d never planned involvement.

“Additionally,” Li Zekai continued, “I propose collaboration with your pharmaceutical venture.”

Guan Yu frowned. “How do you know about that?”

Only Jiang Dawei and Li Feng knew his plans.

“We know you cured Taiwan’s Miss Jiang. Even treated Old Master Wen and Liu.” The Li family’s intelligence network proved formidable. Curing Jiang Yiyi drew attention, but Jiang Dawei’s cooperation signaled true significance. The Jiangs never partnered – only acquired. Moreover, Li Zekai’s channels revealed Beijing’s support for Guan Yu.

With potential to surpass the Song family, backed by the Jiang and Dongfang clans, Guan Yu became a strategic partner. Aligning with a miracle doctor promised profit.

“Ten billion yuan for 10% equity. Interested?”

“Generous, but no.” Guan Yu swirled his wine glass.

“Why?” Li Zekai frowned, expecting negotiation, not refusal.

“You know I only granted Jiangs distribution rights. Why seek equity? Think me gullible?” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy.

Li Zekai stayed silent. He’d underestimated Guan Yu earlier – a mere college student, however remarkable. Now reassessing.

“Twenty billion for 10%.”

“Impossible.” Guan Yu cut him off. “I need investors, not partners. If you can’t accept distribution rights, send someone authorized.”

Li Zekai’s composure cracked. As Zejia’s VP and Li Zejia’s brother, condescending to negotiate already strained his dignity. Yet Guan Yu demanded higher authority?

“Understand – our withdrawal stems from strategy, not fear…” The threat hung unspoken.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Then why remain?”

Li Zekai’s mask slipped briefly before reforming. “Reconsider. Mutual benefit awaits.”

“Escort our guest out,” Guan Yu commanded.

“Was that wise?” Jiang Ziqi worried after Li Zekai left. Provoking the Lis risked catastrophic retaliation.

Dongfang Mu chuckled. “Note his wording – opposing you wasn’t his initiative.”

“But antagonizing Hong Kong’s Lis…” Jiang Ziqi fretted about political fallout.

“The British acquisition consumes them. They lack capacity for new fronts. Guan Yu’s safe.”

Dongfang Mu then asked, “Why refuse their investment?”

Ten billion could solve funding issues.

Guan Yu explained, “Cooperating with both Dihao and Zejia risks conflict. My pharma venture needs global reach – starting with Southeast Asia through Dihao.”

Dongfang Mu nodded. Dihao’s regional dominance outweighed Zejia’s.

**Chapter 1081: Dongfang Mu in Love**

“Besides,” Guan Yu grinned, “I have you two.”

“Us?” The duo exchanged glances.

“Invest! My funds are limited. What are brothers for?”

Jiang Ziqi gaped. Even Song and Jiang offers were refused.

“If you need money…” Dongfang Mu began.

“We share fortunes and misfortunes. Plus,” Guan Yu added, “I’ll need management help.”

Dongfang Mu agreed readily. The Dongfang clan could provide experts.

“Ten billion for 5% from me,” Dongfang Mu offered.

“Three-four billion max from me,” Jiang Ziqi said – his entire savings.

Guan Yu approved. Enough for construction. Now awaited the Song family showdown.

To reassure them, Guan Yu disclosed retired officials’ support. “After this, the Song dynasty crumbles.”

“You’ll eradicate them?” Dongfang Mu asked sharply.

“Root and branch. But carefully.” Despite advice for mercy, Guan Yu wouldn’t leave enemies alive.

“Just don’t alert Gao Ce,” Dongfang Mu warned. “Or you’ll become the next Song.”

The door burst open. A vibrant girl dragged Guan Yu up – Dongfang Huowu.

“Must you be so unladylike?” Dongfang Mu sighed. Her punk phase gone, tomboyishness remained.

Ignoring him, Huowulugged Guan Yu. “You promised racing!”

“What nonsense!” Dongfang Mu scolded.

“Girls can’t drive?” she retorted. “You forgot, Master?”

Guan Yu remembered their deal. “Have you kept your promise?”

“Master!” She grimaced, massaging his shoulders under duress.

Jiang Ziqi marveled – the wildest heiress tamed!

“Race starts midnight,” she said. Underground events avoided police.

“Must you indulge her?” Dongfang Mu frowned.

Huowu threatened, “Or I’ll tell parents about your girlfriend!”

Dongfang Mu choked. “You wouldn’t!”

**Chapter 1082: Sun Yaoqi**

“Big brother’s in love? Who?” All pressed as Dongfang Mu blushed crimson.

“No aristocrat – just an ordinary clerk.” The thirty-something tycoon stammered like a schoolboy.

Huowu mocked, “So shy! Man up!”

That night, they reached an unfinished mountain highway transformed into roaring racetrack. Engines screamed through the midnight air as crowds cheered.
