“Master Zheng, since Du Bingyan and Xiao Zhi are deeply in love and will marry, she will naturally reside within Xuánzhōng Peak. I wonder if we could formally accept her as a disciple of the Yúnqīng Sect. This would make it easier to support her in sect matters later,” Guān Yǔ proposed, recalling a pressing matter.

Zheng Shǒuzuò, the sect’s chief elder, nodded thoughtfully, while Luó Jié chimed in first, “Hmm, this is an excellent suggestion. I agree. What do you think, Senior Brother?”

“If the young lady is willing, it would indeed be beneficial. After all, she’ll soon be family,” Zheng Shǒuzuò replied. “Within the Yúnqīng Sect, paths inevitably cross. Becoming a disciple would only strengthen her ties here.”

“Xiao Yan, why not formally apprentice yourself now? How about pledging to my father as your master?” Xiao Zhi urged eagerly.

**Chapter 4698: Double Blessings**

If this matter were settled, it would truly be a case of double blessings. “Wonderful! I’d be honored, provided Master Zheng does not find me unworthy,” Du Bingyan replied promptly, nodding in agreement.

Zheng Shǒuzuò waved a hand. “Xiao Zhi, has joy addled your wits? You know our sect’s rules—I cannot accept female disciples. All women must join the Jùhé Peak under Master Dài’s tutelage.”

“Ah, right. I acted rashly,” Guān Yǔ conceded. “But even under Master Dài, it should still be feasible.”

“Then it’s settled. I’ll speak to the Sect Leader. There will be no issue,” Zheng Shǒuzuò declared confidently.

Wáng Jūn interjected, “Wouldn’t placing her on Jùhé Peak cause inconveniences? Though sect rules stand, since Du Bingyan is to marry Xiao Zhi, perhaps they should wed first before discussing apprenticeships. Might that allow her to join Xuánzhōng Peak?”

“Impossible. The sect’s laws are immutable,” Zheng Shǒuzuò stated firmly.

Guān Yǔ, aware of deeper complexities, asked, “Du Bingyan, when we last met in the jianghu, you displayed some martial skill. Who taught you?”

Du Bingyan herself seemed uncertain. “I’ve had no formal master. Perhaps you misremember?”

“No mistake,” Xiao Zhi insisted. “You clearly know lightfoot techniques. I recall it too.”

“It’s… somewhat shameful,” Du Bingyan admitted, lowering her gaze. “Years ago, both my parents fell ill. I had no means to fund their treatment, so I resorted to… theft and deception. Each time, I’d be chased and beaten. I’d run until my legs gave out. Over time, I grew faster, leaping walls I once couldn’t scale. Perhaps practice honed me.”

Zheng Shǒuzuò’s expression darkened. “You mean you’ve cultivated inner energy *on your own*? If true, you cannot pursue immortal cultivation.”

“What? Then she can’t join the sect?” Xiao Zhi exclaimed.

“I don’t know how to check,” Du Bingyan murmured, bewildered by the concept of inner energy despite knowing its martial significance.

The room tensed. Ordinarily, given her ties to Zheng Shǒuzuò, Du Bingyan might have been accepted as a nominal disciple on Jùhé Peak, exempt from training. But if she possessed inner energy—a mark of martial practitioners—sect rules barred her entry.

Guān Yǔ stood. “Let me examine you. Trust me to assess your energy channels.”

Du Bingyan glanced at Xiao Zhi, who nodded. “Perfect! With Guān Yǔ’s dual mastery of magic and martial arts, he’s ideal for this.”

With the elders’ approval, Guān Yǔ asked, “When fleeing, did you ever feel heat in your dantian as you pushed your limits?”

He recalled her sparring with them earlier—skills honed through survival.

“Not initially,” Du Bingyan admitted. “But these past two years, I’ve noticed changes. No one catches me now. Sometimes my dantian warms, filling me with strength.”

Guān Yǔ’s heart sank. “Give me your hand.”

As he checked her pulse and channeled energy into her meridians, his eyes widened. Du Bingyan’s vessels were unusually robust, her bloodflow swift—traits of strenuous exertion, yet she sat calmly. Worse, her dantian housed a solidified inner core, proof she’d long unknowingly cultivated martial energy.

**Chapter 4699: A Missing Bride**

Her extraordinary bone structure and rare vascular gifts marked her as a prodigy. Guān Yǔ opened his eyes to the room’s anxious stares. “Du Bingyan is a natural martial genius. Her inner core is mature—a feat few achieve even with manuals. She’s incompatible with immortal cultivation but destined for martial greatness.”

“You jest!” Xiao Zhi groaned. This ruined her sect prospects.

“I speak truth,” Guān Yǔ insisted. “Rejoice! Her self-taught mastery is remarkable.”

Luó Jié sighed. “Senior Brother, is this fortune or misfortune?”

“Fortune!” Zheng Shǒuzuò boomed, grinning. “Why chain her to sect rules? As Xiao Zhi’s wife and his martial guardian, she’ll thrive unrestrained!”

The room brightened. Luó Jié clasped her hands. “Of course! They’ll complement each other—Xiao Zhi as an immortal cultivator, Du Bingyan as his protector!”

Xiao Zhi beamed, slinging an arm around Du Bingyan. “Heaven ordained us, didn’t it?”

Blushing, Du Bingyan nodded as Luó Jié playfully swatted Xiao Zhi. “Unhand her, you scamp!”

“Mother! Have you abandoned me for a daughter-in-law already?” he mock-protested, sparking laughter.

Guān Yǔ added, “Master Zheng is wise. As a disciple, she’d face restrictions. As a guardian-spouse, she’ll have freedom and purpose.”

“Hah! Now I’ve my own treasure—a partner to rival your fancy artifacts!” Xiao Zhi crowed at Wáng Jūn, who rolled his eyes.

Guān Yǔ offered, “Though Yúnqīng lacks martial masters, I can guide her. My experience—”

“Experience?” Xiao Zhi snorted. “You’ve been here less than a year!”

Wáng Jūn interjected gravely, “Don’t underestimate him. In our homeland, Guān Yǔ was a peerless expert.”

A icy glare from Guān Yǔ silenced him. “Enough tall tales,” Guān Yǔ muttered, though Zheng Shǒuzuò nodded.

“Guān Yǔ’s dual path ensures his prowess. His guidance will prove invaluable.”

As the group dispersed after the feast, Guān Yǔ and Wáng Jūn descended the peak.

“What will you do with the Dragon’s Eye Amber?” Guān Yǔ asked.

Wáng Jūn sighed. “A mixed blessing. If it accepts me as master, I’ll stay sequestered in the sect. If not, I’ll trade it for practical tools.”

“Wise. A celestial artifact invites danger. Stay hidden or exchange it safely.”

**Chapter 4700: As You Advise**

Wáng Jūn nodded, tipsy from wine. The amber’s pupil-like striations unnerved him—a literal dragon’s eye. “To think this trinket’s a celestial treasure…”

Guān Yǔ pressed, “Test its allegiance first. If it rejects you, trade it through Xuán Míng. Such a relic could fetch high-grade artifacts.”

“As you advise,” Wáng Jūn murmured, already dreading the storm its possession might unleash.
