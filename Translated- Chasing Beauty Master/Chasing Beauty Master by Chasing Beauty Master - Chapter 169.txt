Yang Qian’s face twisted as if he’d swallowed a dead fly. This was the first time he’d been publicly humiliated—and by two snot-nosed brats at that. What had started as a simple disciplinary act against Guan Yu on Yang Yi’s behalf now demanded far harsher retribution.

Yang Yang’s eyelid twitched violently. Was Guan Yu an idiot, or did he have hidden backing? To dare speak so boldly while surrounded by armed men—Yang Yang could only conclude Guan Yu was bluffing to mask his fear.

Yet the more defiant Guan Yu acted, the worse his fate would be. Yang Yang snorted coldly.

Yang Yi, hot-tempered and still smarting from Guan Yu’s earlier beating, barked, “Uncle Yang, why waste time talking? Just take him away and teach him a lesson! Let’s see if he’ll still kick me after I crush his balls!”

He shot Guan Yu a venomous glare.

Yang Qian sighed inwardly, cursing Yang Yi as a fool. The gap between Yang Yi and Yang Yang was staggering. Hadn’t Yang Yi noticed they’d brought troops? Everything needed to follow protocol. Taking Guan Yu “officially” would allow private retribution later. Yet here Yang Yi was, blabbering recklessly—his words ripe fodder for accusations of the Yang family abusing power.

Guan Yu smirked at Yang Qian. “So this is official business masking personal vendettas?”

Yang Qian retorted, “You’ve committed assault—this is lawful arrest. Take him.”

“You decree assault, yet I call it self-defense. Besides, arrests fall under police jurisdiction. Since when does the military handle brawls?” Guan Yu scoffed.

Yang Qian frowned. True, soldiers typically didn’t intervene in civilian disputes. But power transcended boundaries when dealing with nobodies. Rules bent for the insignificant.

“Self-defense? Bullshit self-defense!” Yang Yi’s rage flared hotter at the claim.

Guan Yu remained calm, turning to Zhao Jinger with a playful smile. “Jing’er, he refuses to believe I acted in self-defense. His breath reeked worse than a latrine even before vomiting. Had that filth touched me, the stench alone could’ve killed me. If that’s not justification for self-defense, what is?”

Zhao Jinger burst into laughter, nodding like a pecking chick. Her smile bloomed like a sudden flower—fresh, enchanting.

Guan Yu tilted his head at Yang Yi. “Frankly, I’m amazed you survived being drenched in that putrid spew. Oh wait—you even swallowed some! Raised on shit, you’re immune to the stench, eh?”

Yang Yi’s stomach churned at the description, bile rising anew. Crimson-eyed, he roared, “I’ll kill you!”

He lunged, but Guan Yu’s swift kick sent him crashing to the floor, writhing in pain.

Dusting his hands, Guan Yu innocently addressed Yang Qian: “You heard his murder threat. That’s self-defense too. Your trip wasn’t wasted—arrest him for attempted homicide. Surely a graver charge than my ‘assault’?”

The soldiers only reacted after Yang Yi lay trampled underfoot, training weapons on Guan Yu. Though outwardly composed, cold sweat soaked Guan Yu’s back. If they fired, he’d be finished.

He mentally cursed Tian Xun’s team—where were they now?

Yang Qian’s face flushed crimson with fury. Guan Yu’s audacity to humiliate Yang Yi under gunpoint slapped the Yang family’s prestige. Snarling, he ordered, “I witnessed your assault firsthand. Take him. Shoot if he resists.”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. As soldiers approached, he vengefully stomped Yang Yi’s chest before standing motionless. The brutal kick popped Yang Yi’s eyes wide before he lost consciousness.

Rifles cocked in unison, muzzles fixed on Guan Yu.

Tension crystallized the air.

Then—a figure materialized between Guan Yu and the soldiers.

**Chapter 417: Eccentricities of the Mighty**

“You cannot take him.” The newcomer stared down Yang Qian, voice glacial.

Guan Yu exhaled in relief upon recognizing Tian Xun’s silhouette. He marveled at the bodyguard’s stealth—slipping past armed troops undetected required phenomenal skill.

Yang Qian started at the intrusion, then bristled at Tian Xun’s commanding tone. “Who are you to—”

His words died as Tian Xun flashed a Zhongnanhai Special Security ID. Yang Qian’s eyes bulged. This emblem granted lethal authority to protect state dignitaries. What connection did Guan Yu have to warrant such protection?

Yang Yang’s mind reeled equally. These “nobodies” could summon elite guards even the Yangs couldn’t command? His gaze shifted to Zhao Jinger—perhaps she was the key. Noticing Tian Xun’s protective stance toward her, he realized further confrontation risked disaster.

“Our apologies for the misunderstanding,” Yang Yang interjected smoothly. “Let’s retire. Uncle, we’re leaving.”

Guan Yu snorted, “Save your fake courtesy. Scram before you ruin our appetites.”

Murder flickered in Yang Yang’s eyes before he led the retreat.

Alone again, Guan Yu glared at Tian Xun. “Nearly became Swiss cheese waiting for you!”

“You were never in danger,” Tian Xun replied impassively.

“Then why the delayed entrance?”

“Testing if you’re worth protecting.”

“And?”

“You passed.”

“What if I hadn’t?”

“I’d have resigned.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. *Why do experts have such quirks?*

Later, Zhao Jinger pouted at Guan Yu. “You were too reckless, Brother.”

He grinned sheepishly. “Couldn’t let them bully you.”

The excuse worked—her scolding ceased as they finished dinner.

Exiting the hotel, Guan Yu suddenly stiffened, sensing unseen eyes. A shadowed figure watched from nearby—Lin Dong.

“Boring,” Tian Xun’s voice came behind Lin Dong.

Without turning, Lin Dong chuckled. “Can one guard stop me?”

As the cigarette fell, the battle began.

**Chapter 418: Morning Training**

Returning home, Zhao Zilong awaited. After Zhao Jinger retired, the old chief warned: “Lin Dong found you. Tian Xun intercepted him but got injured. Stay here—Zhongnanhai’s secure.”

Guan Yu refused. “I’ll be the bait to trap him.”

Zhao Zilong approved the plan.

At dawn, Guan Yu jogged to a lakeside exercise area—and found Yang Yang practicing tai chi with an elder.

Their eyes met. Yang Yang’s smile dripped venom as Guan Yu’s lips curled in challenge. The game continued.
