The scene differed from Hu Xiaohai’s earlier test. When Hu Xiaohai was tested, the colors on the crystal orb had shifted gradually, but Huo Lingling’s had turned violet in an instant. This could only mean one thing—her talent surpassed Hu Xiaohai’s!

“Truly astonishing! Who could have imagined our Huntian Sect would produce two prodigies in one generation?”

“Congratulations, Sect Master! Your daughter’s talent has left this old man in awe!”

Praise flooded the air, yet the center of attention, Huo Lingling, seemed indifferent. She merely nodded politely to Grand Elder Suoluo before turning to leave. As she walked away, his voice boomed:

“Huo Lingling—Level 7 magical aura!”

The crowd erupted anew. Huo Zhengtian, her father, beamed with pride. His mischievous daughter, whom he’d once dismissed as a carefree slacker, had secretly honed her magic. Talent alone meant little without effort—how had she hidden such dedication?

“Little imp,” Guan Yu teased as she descended the platform, playfully tapping her nose. “You’ve outdone even me!”

As Huo Lingling stepped down, the audience emerged from their daze. But the sight of her intimate rapport with Guan Yu stirred whispers of envy. For suitors like Hu Xiaohai, it was galling.

Previously, they’d pursued her as a trophy—a means to inherit the Huntian Sect. Now, her formidable talent made her far more than a mere prize.

“Huo Lingling,” Hu Xiaohai muttered through gritted teeth, “I’ll make you submit to me!”

By noon, the final disciple completed the assessment. Grand Elder Suoluo reviewed the results, satisfaction flickering across his stern face. Hu Xiaohai’s excellence was expected, but Huo Lingling had been the day’s dark horse.

“The testing phase concludes,” Suoluo announced. “The top three—Huo Lingling, Hu Xiaohai, and Enkesi—may select a magic scroll from the Scripture Pavilion. The other twenty qualifiers will each receive a Fire Spirit Pill.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd. A single Fire Spirit Pill cost 100 gold coins—three months’ allowance for most disciples. For novices, it accelerated six months’ cultivation. Magic scrolls, however, were priceless treasures. Even the crudest scroll fetched over 1,000 gold, as only Forbidden Spell Mages could craft them.

Traditionally, the next phase allowed unqualified disciples to challenge the successful. But before Suoluo could announce it, a voice interrupted:

“Grand Elder Suoluo... I have a request.”

All turned to see Huo Lingling standing resolute.

“Speak,” Suoluo said, masking irritation.

“May... may Brother Guan Yu take the test?”

The crowd exploded. “What’s that waste of space to her?” someone jeered. “An outsider has no right!”

“Silence!” Suoluo’s roar quelled the tumult. He approached Guan Yu. “Do you seek to participate?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “It matters little to me.”

“So this is your whim?” Suoluo arched a brow at Huo Lingling.

Blushing, she glanced at her father. “He wants to! He’s just worried about objections!”

Huo Zhengtian stroked his beard thoughtfully. Before he could speak, Elder Griffin interjected: “Sect Master! For a century, only sect disciples have undergone this trial. Allowing an outsider—”

“Traditions,” Huo Zhengtian countered, “exist to be broken. Our rivals grow stronger daily. Stagnation spells doom.”

Griffin sneered at Elder Huang Tianji. “Some elders coddle weakness. That’s our true blight.”

“You dare?!” Huang Tianji shot up, fist clenched.

“Sit!” Huo Zhengtian’s aura flared, crushing dissent. Reluctantly, the elders acquiesced.

As Guan Yu mounted the platform, derisive stares followed. He scanned the crowd coldly. “Petty fools. When I recover, you’ll rue your ignorance.”

Huo Zhengtian nodded encouragement. He knew Guan Yu’s crippled state—yet believed in hidden depths.

Guan Yu placed his palm on the crystal orb. Nothing happened. Snickers arose.

Then—

A violet blaze erupted, blinding the crowd. The light paled to soft orange. Gasps turned to stunned silence.

*Crack!* Huo Zhengtian’s teacup shattered unnoticed. All eyes locked on the stone tablet behind Guan Yu.

“Magic Power—” Suoluo’s voice trembled. “Level 9!”

The crowd roared. “Level 9?! Even Lady Lingling and Hu Xiaohai only reached 7!”

“A genius unseen in centuries!”

Hu Xiaohai clawed at his hair. “Impossible! This fraud!”

Enkesi whispered, “Challenge him later. His aura’s weak—expose the farce.”

Elder Griffin scoffed. “He’s drugged! The truth will out!”

Elder Huang snorted. “Jealousy suits you, old man. Name this mythical drug!”

As the elders bickered, Guan Yu descended, a faint smirk on his lips.

Murmurs swelled. “A Level 9 talent could rank continent-wide!”

“We’re beneath a ‘cripple’? Pathetic!”

Hu Xiaohai seethed. Enkesi’s plot offered scant comfort. How had this trash eclipsed him?

Huo Lingling beamed, earlier anxiety forgotten. Her gamble had paid off—spectacularly.

Suoluo studied Guan Yu, marveling. The youth’s drained core shouldn’t permit such a display. What sorcery was this?

Guan Yu met the crowd’s awe with icy calm. Let them whisper. Soon enough, they’d learn their place.

The Huntian Sect’s balance of power had shifted—irrevocably.
