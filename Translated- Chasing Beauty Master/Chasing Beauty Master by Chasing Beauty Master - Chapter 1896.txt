After all, this was the imperial palace. Acting recklessly here was impossible. If discovered, their only option would be to flee before their identities were exposed. However, gaining entry again afterward would prove far more difficult.

With this failed attempt as precedent, the palace guards would undoubtedly tighten security. After a while, a patrol squad passed by outside without noticing anything amiss, their footsteps gradually fading into the distance.

Guan Yu finally stood up and relaxed slightly. "It seems our presence remains undetected," he said, "but we mustn't let our guard down. Extreme caution is still required."

He approached the massive white gemstone, running his hand across its surface. Under moonlight, the stone emitted a faint milky glow, resembling a dim white lantern.

Qiqi, ever the curious one, circled the hall like an excited child. She plopped onto the Dragon Throne and pouted, "So this is the legendary seat everyone covets? Just an oversized chair. Doesn't feel special at all."

She then wandered off to explore other areas, examining everything with playful fascination. Guan Yu had to admit her reflexes earlier had been impressive – synchronized with his movements, she'd somehow produced a handful of knockout powder from her large pack, swiftly incapacitating two guards.

"A clever solution for close encounters," Guan Yu remarked, eyeing her bulging satchel. "Heaven knows what else that girl carries in there."

Wang Xiaorong approached the luminous stone. "Guan Yu, are you certain this contains the Eight-Drum Art? Could we be mistaken?"

"Unlikely. You saw the golden threads flowing within. The symbols that manifested earlier match those of the Eight-Drum Art," Guan Yu asserted.

"Symbols can be deceiving," Wang Xiaorong countered. "The Eight-Drum Art has numerous variations. This could be coincidence. How could an entire cultivation method be sealed within stone? The concept itself defies belief."

"The symbols I witnessed are unique," Guan Yu insisted. "The inscription 'Longevity Rivaling Heaven' refers not to a person, but to this very art. While I can't explain how it's contained here, those golden veins are undoubtedly the Eight-Drum Art's essence."

He gestured at the pulsating luminescence within the gem. "The Eight-Drum Art's mysteries transcend our understanding. Though I don't know how it came to reside here, those golden currents are precisely what we seek."

"Then we must devise extraction methods immediately!" Wang Xiaorong urged.

Guan Yu shook his head. "That's the crux I've been contemplating without solution. We can't possibly remove this massive stone – its weight would hinder our escape."

"Why not smash it?" Qiqi suggested, slapping the gem's surface. "Break the stone and retrieve what's inside!"

**Chapter 4983: No Easy Solutions**

Guan Yu gave her a wry look. "If it were that simple, would I be standing here perplexed? This isn't our backyard. Any commotion could bring guards before we extract anything."

"What's there to fear?" Qiqi thumped her chest. "Let them come! Find me a sledgehammer and I'll crack this pebble open!"

"Cease this nonsense," Wang Xiaorong chided. "You couldn't shatter it if you tried."

"Don't underestimate me!" Qiqi protested. "Small frame hides great strength!"

Guan Yu intervened, "This is no ordinary stone. As a spirit gem, white quartz ranks lowest in energy storage capacity but highest in durability – harder than granite or even solid mercury. This specimen's size and purity are unmatched in the martial world."

Qiqi skeptically patted the gem. "Any stone breaks with enough force."

"Our circumstances forbid such risks," Guan Yu countered. "I'll consult the Emperor's Seal artifact spirit. You two maintain vigilance without causing disturbances."

As his companions nodded obediently, Guan Yu focused his consciousness into the mystical seal.

"I've located another fragment," he announced within the artifact's dimensional space.

The seal's spirit manifested as a smoky visage. "Master, the two fragments you've provided exhibit interconnected mysteries. Their symbols suggest an ancient language, though deciphering progresses slowly. Full comprehension may require collecting all four fragments."

"Could they require activation methods even when assembled?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Speculation only," the spirit clarified. "Current priority remains retrieval. Regarding the white gem... Perhaps releasing existing fragments might draw out the third portion through resonance."

**Chapter 4984: Escalation**

Emerging from his trance, Guan Yu found Wang Xiaorong anxious. "Dawn approaches. Have you found a solution?"

"One risky approach." He produced the Emperor's Seal. "By releasing stored fragments, we might trigger the gem's resonance."

Golden symbols erupted from the artifact, flooding the hall with radiant light. The white gem trembled as swirling characters encircled it, their brilliance visible through windows.

Panicked shouts arose outside as the entire palace complex glowed. Guan Yu released the second fragment, intensifying the spectacle. Golden symbols now enveloped the building like celestial script, while the gem's internal currents accelerated frenetically.

With earth-shaking detonation, the white gem exploded into powdery mist. A luminous pillar shot skyward as snowy particulates settled over the golden rooftops.

"It's happening!" Wang Xiaorong gasped. "The prophecy fulfills – Imperial Longevity, Heavenly Radiance, Snow-Clad Golden Hall, Divine Art Revealed!"

Guan Yu stared in awe. The three fragments' symbols now danced around the palace, fulfilling ancient conditions perfectly. But the commotion had alerted the entire capital – including dangerous factions.

Urgently channeling his cultivation, Guan Yu attempted to recall the swirling symbols into the Emperor's Seal. Yet the rebellious fragments resisted control, their golden light illuminating the night as chaos unfolded.
