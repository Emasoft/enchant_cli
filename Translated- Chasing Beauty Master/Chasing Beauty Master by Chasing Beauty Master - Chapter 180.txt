Moreover, her son had vanished right under her nose, which would undoubtedly disgrace Guan Yu if word got out.

At this moment, Guan Yu stood rooted in place with remarkable composure, his brows slightly furrowed. He considered child-trafficking rings but immediately dismissed the idea. For kidnappers to spirit away the boy within five seconds while evading his surveillance would require someone of Lin Dong's caliber - but how many such experts existed? Would anyone with such skills stoop to child abduction?

Eliminating that possibility left only a meticulously planned, targeted conspiracy. He glanced at the young mother, considering asking about potential enemies before abandoning the thought. Why would a stranger confide personal details to someone they'd never met?

As his frown deepened, a family passed by - parents flanking their daughter who held a Mickey Mouse balloon. The floating cartoon visage triggered sudden clarity. The answer lay with that costumed character who'd been closest to the boy earlier.

Whirling around, Guan Yu's piercing gaze locked onto the Mickey mascot. The costume's abdomen now appeared conspicuously distended compared to minutes before. Only one explanation existed - the vanished child lay concealed within that false paunch.

Cold fury ignited in Guan Yu's eyes. Trapping a child in that airless space during winter could prove fatal within minutes. He materialized beside the mascot, halting its progress with one hand. His detection system revealed a blank-faced man inside the suit, the boy lying motionless in a hidden compartment. Guan Yu's smile widened, radiating glacial menace.

"Release the boy," he commanded icily.

The mascot shook its head mechanically, gesturing forward to rejoin the parade. When it tried shaking free, Guan Yu's grip became immovable. Ordinarily, he'd never show such restraint with scum, but concern for the child's safety stayed his hand. As the mascot passed again, Guan Yu activated his gravity system, anchoring the figure in place.

Reaching for the back zipper, Guan Yu intended to unravel this mystery physically. The man inside tensed - their carefully orchestrated scheme couldn't unravel now. "The mark discovered us!" he hissed into hidden comms. "Neutralize him!"

Exploding into motion, the mascot broke free, blocking Guan Yu's reach while throwing a gut punch. Guan Yu's eyebrows rose in mild surprise before countering with a triple-strike Bone Crusher technique amplified by gravity systems. The mascot flew backward from the impact, shock registering as he crashed down.

Before Guan Yu could press the advantage, other parade characters shed costumes to surround him. The fallen mascot scrambled up, fleeing toward exits with his precious cargo. Guan Yu's冷笑cut through the air. "Calling reinforcements? You're outclassed."

"Tian Xun," he addressed the air, "handle these vermin. I'll pursue."

"Confirming?" came the disembodied reply. "This jeopardizes all operations. High risk."

"Human lives override protocols," Guan Yu stated without hesitation.

"Five seconds," Tian Xun responded tersely.

The encircling thugs scoffed at the apparent bluff until a larger force materialized around them. Tian Xun's squad moved with military precision, neutralizing the opposition in six brutal seconds. Guan Yu barely registered the efficiency, already strategizing the chase.

"They herded the target to the rollercoaster maintenance platform," Tian Xun updated. "He's shed the costume but carries the boy."

Guan Yu nodded, tapping his abdomen meaningfully. As they raced toward the site, the kidnapper's desperation mounted. Cornered on a thirty-meter platform, the man weighed options - surrender meant ruin, but the child's death might still serve his employer's goals.

With feral grin, he hurled the boy over the edge like a shot put. "Bastard!" Tian Xun roared as the kidnapper scaled railings in escape.

Below, Guan Yu positioned himself directly under the plummeting child. Activating full gravity systems, he braced as human comet struck his outstretched arms. Twin cracks echoed as shoulder bones fractured. When the boy slipped toward headfirst impact, Guan Yu threw himself beneath, taking the full force in his abdomen. Blood sprayed as ribs buckled, but the child lay unharmed on his chest.

The crowd's jeers turned to stunned applause. The mother's anguished cry transformed into disbelieving joy as she embraced her son. Tian Xun stared at the wheezing Guan Yu - this reckless savior had rewritten his understanding of human limits.
