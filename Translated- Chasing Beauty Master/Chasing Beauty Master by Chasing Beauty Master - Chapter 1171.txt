Xue Jing sat beside Lin Qiaoqiao, gazing into her eyes as she said, “It’s not that I’m unwilling to lend Guan Yu to you. But doing so would put him in grave danger. Could you make a different request?”

Though lending Guan Yu to Lin Qiaoqiao for three days seemed trivial, the risks were substantial. Lin Qiaoqiao wasn’t a cultivator, and if trouble arose while they were together, Guan Yu would be left without allies. The danger would be immense.

Guan Yu could tell Xue Jing didn’t want Lin Qiaoqiao to misunderstand but struggled to explain. Without clarity, this matter might strain their sisterly bond.

Xue Jing also knew that if Lin Qiaoqiao kept clinging to Guan Yu, he’d eventually succumb to her charms. Sooner or later, Lin Qiaoqiao would move into Qiao Garden. Yet Xue Jing had made peace with this—jealousy was futile. Guan Yu’s magnetic allure was simply unstoppable.

What was meant to come couldn’t be blocked. Xue Jing glanced at Guan Yu, who understood her silent plea and nodded. Since Lin Qiaoqiao wasn’t an outsider—nor would she become an enemy—disclosing the truth posed no harm.

“The truth is,” Xue Jing began, “Guan Yu is now an ordinary man. He’s lost all his cultivation. Accompanying you outside would be too perilous.”

“What?!” Lin Qiaoqiao gaped at Guan Yu, speechless. “Are you joking, Jingjing? This isn’t funny!”

Her question was merely for composure. She trusted Xue Jing implicitly, especially given her solemn tone. This was no jest.

Lin Qiaoqiao suddenly realized why Xue Jing had shadowed Guan Yu so closely lately—she’d been protecting him.

Seeing both silent, Lin Qiaoqiao hesitated before asking, “How did this happen? I’ve never heard of cultivation disappearing!”

Though not a cultivator herself, Lin Qiaoqiao understood their ways. Guan Yu’s situation baffled her.

Guan Yu explained, “It’s complicated. A mysterious force sealed my powers. My inner energy refuses to respond. I’m practically ordinary now, retaining only martial techniques. Does that make sense?”

Lin Qiaoqiao nodded, gripping Xue Jing’s hand. “Jingjing, I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I’ll... think of another plan.” Her voice trailed off dejectedly.

Xue Jing smiled. “Why do you need to borrow my Guan Yu as a fake boyfriend anyway? Did your parents start pressuring you again—”

“Yes, worse than ever.” Lin Qiaoqiao sighed. “Father announced a martial arts contest to choose my husband. I refused, claiming I already had a boyfriend—the man they saw last time. But Father insists my partner must excel in combat, so Guan Yu needs to prove his skills.

I told Father Guan Yu was unbeatable. That’s why I came... but now... I’m doomed to accept this arranged contest.”

Xue Jing frowned. “This modern age still holds martial arts contests? Your family’s traditional, but this is archaic!”

“What choice do I have?” Lin Qiaoqiao shrugged. “As the sole heir of a martial lineage—and a woman—Father pins all hopes on me.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “I never knew you came from a martial arts family.”

“Haven’t I mentioned this?” Xue Jing interjected. “The Lins were once prestigious. Their ancestor trained under Lin Chong (Panther Head), the historic Eight Hundred Thousand Imperial Guards’ spear instructor. The Lin Family Spear Technique persists today.”

“Oh, stop!” Lin Qiaoqiao blushed. “Ancient Lin spearmanship was formidable, but our current version belongs on opera stages. Father’s drills are pure theater.”

Laughter erupted. Guan Yu asked, “If your family’s art declined so much, why hold a contest? Couldn’t any challenger defeat you?”

“It’s not about me fighting. Father wants someone robust to protect me. He invited a martial friend—contestants must defeat him first.”

Xue Jing added, “Though their techniques faded, the Lin name still commands respect in Jianghu.”

“Jingjing...” Lin Qiaoqiao groaned. “Enough teasing! I pretended Guan Yu could help, but now... I’m resigned to fate.”

Guan Yu understood—in martial clans, women’s marriages were often arranged. Men kept multiple wives, but Lin Qiaoqiao’s freedom to choose a boyfriend was already rare, albeit conditional.

If Guan Yu couldn’t assist, Lin Qiaoqiao faced inevitable compliance. He declared, “I’ll be your three-day boyfriend.”

“Really?!” Lin Qiaoqiao brightened.

“Absolutely not!” Xue Jing objected. “It’s too dangerous. You can’t fight!”

Guan Yu countered, “My techniques remain. Challengers won’t be masters.”

“No! What if enemies target you? I forbid it.”

Guan Yu turned to Lin Qiaoqiao. “Would you mind covert protection?”

“Of course not! Just help me!”

“Then let Jiciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) guard me secretly. Satisfied?”

Before Xue Jing could protest, Lin Qiaoqiao interjected, “If you refuse now, you’re sabotaging me! Guan Yu agreed!”

Xue Jing inhaled deeply. “It’s not opposition—it’s genuine danger. Even with Jiciyu’s protection, any skilled fighter could defeat you. What’s the point?”

“Don’t underestimate me. Even you might struggle to subdue me quickly,” Guan Yu asserted.

Though his cultivation and inner energy were sealed, combat techniques remained. Without energy reserves, prolonged battles exhausted him, but he believed he could endure limited challenges.

Xue Jing arched a brow. “Confident? Survive two minutes against me, and I’ll consent.”

“Deal. Let’s spar now.”

In the courtyard, they faced off five meters apart. Lin Qiaoqiao excitedly filmed with her phone. “Give it your all! This’ll be epic!”

“Stop!” Xue Jing warned. “No recordings. Experts might discern Guan Yu’s condition. Delete that.”

Grumbling, Lin Qiaoqiao complied. “Fine. No evidence.”

Xue Jing’s thorough precautions impressed Guan Yu. “Ready? Don’t hold back. Qiaoqiao, time us.”

“Gladly!” Lin Qiaoqiao cheered, thrilled by her first live duel between “masters.”

Xue Jing nodded. “I’m set. Attack first—I won’t go easy.”

As Guan Yu poised to strike, chattering erupted. He sighed—Zhang Han’s group had arrived.

Amei, overhearing kitchen chatter, had spread news of the duel. Now Zhang Han, Lü Mei, Lanyu, and Sakura crowded the doorway.

“Told you we weren’t late!” Zhang Han huffed at Lü Mei. “Dragging my chubby self...”

“You’re not fat!” Lü Mei retorted. “Just... well-fed.”

Lanyu gasped. “Look how serious Guan Yu looks! Are they really fighting?”

Guan Yu shot them an exasperated glance. “Ladies, silence! No distractions.”

Lanyu mimed zipping her lips. Amei whispered, “He’s nervous—might lose. Don’t jinx him.”

Confused, Lanyu murmured, “But Guan Yu’s invincible...” Unaware of his lost cultivation, she remembered him effortlessly defeating thugs.

Xue Jing steeled herself. Beating Guan Yu publicly might bruise his pride, but safety outweighed面子 (face). “Ready?”

Guan Yu nodded, brandishing a branch—a meager substitute for weapons, but better than empty hands against Xue Jing’s dagger.

Lin Qiaoqiao started the timer, praying he’d last two minutes.

Xue Jing sighed at his makeshift weapon. The onlookers’ dubious looks mirrored her thoughts—this seemed absurd.

“Begin!”
