At this moment, Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) approached carrying a teapot. Setting it down, she poured tea for the Demon Sovereign and the Left Envoy.

The Demon Sovereign placed a chess piece on the board with a satisfied nod. "I hear Yunqing Sect has been quite active these past few days," he remarked.

Wang Xiaorong pouted. "Father, when will you let me go out again?"

"Presumptuous!" The Demon Sovereign feigned anger. "Haven't you caused enough trouble? Every time you venture out, you bring back a heap of problems! Last time you even colluded with Yunqing disciples! Without my permission, you shan't step beyond Demon Soul Sect's boundaries—or face disciplinary action!"

"But Father!" She protested. "Didn't I help eliminate the Blood Lord? My dealings with Yunqing disciples were mutually beneficial. Our opposition to righteous sects doesn't preclude strategic alliances!"

"Enough! You'll remain here until I say otherwise."

"Would you keep me imprisoned forever?" Wang Xiaorong wheedled. "Let me wither away in this place?"

"Spare me your theatrics." The Demon Sovereign snorted. "I've grown immune to your ploys since childhood. You'll leave when I deem fit."

Sulking, Wang Xiaorong sipped her tea, casting meaningful glances at the Left Envoy who pointedly avoided her gaze. He dared not intercede—knowing any misstep would bring the Sovereign's wrath upon himself rather than the privileged young mistress.

The Demon Sovereign moved another piece. "What of Duobao Mountain?"

"We've established outposts around it," the Left Envoy reported. "Our scouts found it riddled with traps—none returned alive. We've halted further exploration to avoid damaging the Eight-Sided Drum Art or other relics within."

"Patience serves us well. This millennium-old treasure won't vanish. I hear Strange Demon Cave and Blood Hunt Sect have also taken interest?"

"Your intelligence remains sharp, Sovereign. The Strange Demon women pose little threat, but Blood Hunt Sect mobilizes substantial forces."

"And the righteous sects?"

"Yunqing recently concluded their Six Peaks Tournament, selecting four elite disciples—Xiao Zhi and A'Ze from Xuanyong Peak, Siqi from Juhe Peak, and Guan Yu from Tiger Head Peak. They likely head to Duobao Mountain for the Drum Art."

Wang Xiaorong's eyes widened. "Guan Yu made the top four? Has Yunqing fallen so low?"

The Demon Sovereign turned. "You know this Guan Yu?"

"We've met," she said airily. "An utterly mediocre cultivator—barely worth noting."

"Yet you speak of him constantly," her father countered. "Didn't you praise his dual cultivation talents before?"

Caught off-guard, Wang Xiaorong stammered, "I—I never—"

The Left Envoy tactfully interjected: "Reports indicate Guan Yu's magical artifacts were confiscated after disciplinary issues—including the Blackblood Ridge's Blazing Heaven Furnace."

Wang Xiaorong's composure cracked. "Without his artifacts, he's defenseless! Why would Yunqing send him?"

The Demon Sovereign stroked his long hair. "Let the righteous sects and others clash at Duobao Mountain. We'll claim the spoils when they're weakened."

Seizing her chance, Wang Xiaorong pleaded, "Let me monitor the situation! I'll gather intelligence—"

After strategic persuasion from the Left Envoy, the Demon Sovereign relented: "Depart tomorrow. Observe discreetly and report regularly."

Overjoyed, Wang Xiaorong dashed off as her father sighed. "That girl's been restless since meeting that Guan Yu."

"Perhaps their connection could benefit us," the Left Envoy suggested. "A dual-cultivator would be valuable..."

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's group arrived at Xiao Zhi's uncle Luo's mansion in Qujiang City. The merchant's compound sprawled across three courtyards, its banquet hall laden with thirty dishes served by attentive maids who rotated platters around the massive table.

During the feast, Xiao Zhi inquired about the missing steward. "Uncle Luo, where's Minister Chen?"

The merchant sighed. "Taken ill suddenly. Sent him home with gold for treatment—though money can't cure ailments."

Guan Yu noted the new steward's obsequious manner and the odd disappearance of the robust former attendant—a man who'd borne traces of spiritual energy. The mystery lingered as courses cycled before them, each dish presented with ceremonial precision.
