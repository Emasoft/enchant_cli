“Assemble, everyone assemble here at once!” Constable Han shouted loudly. “I can’t walk another step. Those of you still energetic enough can continue searching here to capture Guan Yu. Bring me a good horse now – I need to return, rest, eat something, and get proper sleep.”

After his command, not a soul moved. The men hung their heads in silence, none bringing forward a horse. They'd all stayed awake through the night searching, while Constable Han had remained mounted without moving an inch, yet now claimed exhaustion.

Chapter 3734: Wonderful

When even the soldiers hadn't complained of weariness, how could these exhausted men continue searching? For all they knew, their quarry had long escaped. That a mere constable would abandon them to rest alone while ordering others to keep searching made no sense – hence their silent defiance.

“Are you all deaf?” Constable Han growled in frustration. Though his subordinates normally obeyed without question, fearing his petty retaliations, resentment simmered beneath their lowered gazes.

A soldier finally approached. “Constable Han, here’s the horse I’ve been tending. It’s well-rested – please ride back and recuperate.” Observing his men’s fatigue, the constable relented: “Very well. Let’s suspend the manhunt and all return to rest.”

Though known for pettiness and obstinacy, Constable Han occasionally showed consideration. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi had kept vigil beside Guan Yu’s unconscious form throughout the night. As dawn broke without improvement, he suggested: “Senior Brother Yan Zhao, let’s find lodging. We should prioritize Guan Yu’s condition over our sect mission.”

Yan Zhao agreed readily – discovering Guan Yu possessed the Eight-Sided Drum Technique made preserving his life more crucial than their desert expedition. After settling Guan Yu on horseback, they traveled until reaching grassy plains. “Take Guan Yu ahead slowly,” Yan Zhao instructed. “I’ll scout for dwellings.”

Chapter 3735: Exercise Caution

Emerging from the forest, they found rolling hills. Xiao Zhi paused beneath a tree to rest Guan Yu, whose deepening coma caused growing concern. When Yan Zhao returned dust-covered, he reported: “Five li ahead by a bamboo grove – a farmer’s cottage.”

The bamboo-walled homestead proved quaint and well-kept. An elderly couple emerged after repeated calls – the husband weathered but kind, the wife offering ginger soup. Learning of their childless retreat from town gossip, the travelers accepted humble fare (though Yan Zhao struggled with the bland vegetarian dishes).

“Seeking the Medicine Immortal?” the old farmer asked, noting Guan Yu’s condition. “Through the bamboo forest lives a healer who cures any ailment for a chicken.” Despite skepticism about treating cultivation-related qi deviation, Xiao Zhi resolved to try.

Yan Zhao privately hoped Guan Yu might perish untreated, but acquiesced. As twilight fell, Xiao Zhi ventured into whispering bamboo groves where sentient leaves attacked like shuriken. Deflecting the assault, he challenged the unseen assailant: “I come seeking healing, not conflict!”

The bamboo parted to reveal an elegant pavilion where a white-robed figure sat sipping tea. “Cloud Azure Sect disciples,” the Medicine Immortal sneered, recognizing Xiao Zhi’s techniques. “Why should I aid your kind?”

Chapter 3736: Leave Now

“Does a healer’s virtue bow to old grudges?” Xiao Zhi countered. “Our sect’s reputation matters less than saving a life.” The immortal scoffed: “Curing your friend would embarrass your precious sect – that alone tempts me.” Setting down his cup, he added: “But I’ve tired of chicken payments. State your case, disciple.”

As moonlight filtered through rustling bamboo, the immortal’s eyes glinted with challenge. Xiao Zhi straightened, determination hardening his voice: “Name your price, honored one. My brother’s life is worth more than pride.”
