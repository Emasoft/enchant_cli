The intruder's martial prowess was formidable. After entering, he slaughtered these men as effortlessly as cutting chives, swiftly neutralizing them all. Thus Guan Yu concluded that even remaining within the Pride Heaven Manor posed grave danger.

Previously, Guan Yu had imagined this place would offer sanctuary like the City Lord's residence - secure so long as one stayed within. Now he realized this was neither safe haven nor reliable stronghold. Their best hope lay in finding an opportunity to escape.

The manor lord continued, "Your Highness, you must be weary from your journey. Allow me to have servants prepare hot water for your bath. Freshening up may revive your spirits. Your companions too appear travel-worn."

"Very well," Prince Zou rose, smoothing his robes. "We shall accept your hospitality and rest awhile."

"Arrangements will be made immediately." The manor lord observed the prince's haggard appearance and troubled countenance - clear marks of prolonged hardship.

Guan Yu's group shared this exhaustion. After clashing with Imperial Guards and their frantic flight, the prospect of hot baths seemed heavenly. Moreover, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi's disguises required urgent attention. The false beard clinging to Guan Yu's face threatened to peel off at any moment.

Their assigned chamber, though modestly furnished, proved adequate. Xiao Zhi surveyed the space skeptically. "Three men to one room? How parsimonious of our host."

Wang Jun patted his shoulder. "Shared quarters we could endure, but must we bathe together too? Though we're all men, I find this custom disagreeable."

"Compromise," Guan Yu interjected, removing his fake beard with a practiced flick. "Observe the manor's limited structures. As father and sons, our grouping appears natural. Let us refresh ourselves and repair our disguises."

Wang Jun sighed at his stained gown - once elegant, now marred by dust and blood. "You two fare better. Look at this ruined garment and smeared cosmetics! With no proper makeup here, what am I to do?"

"Your natural beauty needs no enhancement," Guan Yu countered. "Though fresh clothing is essential. I'll procure women's garments for you."

"Fetch extra robes for me too," Xiao Zhi added. "We'll need multiple changes for maintaining disguises - not just clothes but wigs and accessories."

Dawn found the regrouped company in the main hall, seated in a circle with individual dining tables - local custom dictated separate settings even for communal meals. Guan Yu noted this peculiarity: while eliminating reach struggles, it drastically reduced portion sizes compared to the City Lord's thirty-dish feasts.

The manor lord smiled apologetically. "Your Highness, forgive our humble fare. We subsist mainly on vegetables here, though we've procured meat in your honor. Our kitchens lack refinement."

"You've shown great consideration," Prince Zou replied before addressing his retinue. "Remember - no disturbances here. Our host's generosity shouldn't be abused."

"Nonsense!" The manor lord waved dismissively. "Without Your Highness's past patronage, Pride Heaven Manor wouldn't exist. Demand anything you require."

Unbeknownst to the hospitable lord, danger already coiled around his estate. Guan Yu calculated their predicament - Imperial Guards likely sealed all exits, making escape improbable.

"Your adversaries must be formidable," the manor lord pressed. "Have you countermeasures? Name your needs that I may prepare."

"Flight remains our only strategy," Prince Zou admitted. "We depart at dawn tomorrow. A carriage and good horses would suffice."

"Easily arranged. Take some of my guards for protection."

"Small numbers travel swifter," the prince declined. "Easier to evade pursuit."

While others devoured the excellent wine and food, Guan Yu picked at his meal. This royal escort mission had proven far more perilous than anticipated during their carefree departure from Cloud Azure Sect. The prince teetered on death's edge - only miraculous intervention or immortal arts might save him now.

When servants replaced untouched dishes, Guan Yu protested, "Why remove uneaten food?"

Prince Zou explained the local etiquette: "New courses replace old to honor guests. First comes broth to warm the spirit, then dishes reflecting the guest's status." The second course of trotters signaled the prince's exalted standing.

"Forgive my ignorance," Guan Yu bowed. "Your customs differ greatly from my homeland's."

Wang Jun noted, "Where I'm from, fish concludes the meal - signifying no further courses."

"Similar here!" the manor lord beamed. "Two fish for honored guests - double prosperity!"

As night fell, chaos erupted. Roaring flames engulfed the manor while fiery arrows rained from darkness. Guan Yu rushed to the gathering hall where panicked voices rose.

"The entire manor's surrounded!" the manor lord reported. "They demand your surrender through fire."

Prince Zou grimaced. "I've brought ruin upon you."

"Nonsense! Save yourself - they'll breach the walls soon!"

When the full company assembled, Prince Zou turned to Guan Yu. "Last night you devised our escape. What counsel now?"

All eyes turned to the disguised cultivator as crackling flames painted hellish shadows on the walls. Beyond the burning beams, the metallic clang of drawn swords foretold the approaching storm.
