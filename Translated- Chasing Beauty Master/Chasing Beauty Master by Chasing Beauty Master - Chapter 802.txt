Guan Yu caught up to Madame Zhou while carrying the massive stone pillar halfway across the courtyard.

“Madame Zhou, you’d better pick up the pace,” Guan Yu teased as he ran alongside her. Seeing him about to overtake her, Madame Zhou angrily swung the stone pillar in her hands toward Guan Yu.

The three people at the gate gasped as the enormous pillar hurtled toward Guan Yu’s lower back from behind. Wang Jun’s palms grew sweaty with anxiety—it was too late to shout a warning. She covered her eyes, unable to watch.

A strike from such a massive pillar would either kill or cripple. Madame Zhou’s ruthlessness shocked them all. But the unexpected happened: when the pillar slammed into Guan Yu’s back, he simply turned his head and grinned. “Thank you, Madame Zhou.”

**Chapter 2034: Unyielding Pride**

The unexpected happened: Madame Zhou’s stone pillar struck Guan Yu’s lower back, yet he turned with a smile. “Thank you, Madame Zhou.”

Using the momentum of the blow, Guan Yu accelerated, reaching the villa’s entrance in an instant. With a thud, he set the pillar down on the steps.

Madame Zhou arrived moments later, her face twisted with resentment. Had she not inadvertently aided him, she might have won. Still, she begrudgingly admitted his superior speed and strength for someone so young.

Wang Jun leaped for joy. “Yay! Guan Yu won! You’re amazing!” Her eyes shone with admiration.

Madame Zhou scoffed. “That was just a warm-up. Let’s skip the speed test—fight me properly!”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. Her pride couldn’t accept defeat, so she canceled the second round outright. Truthfully, he’d held back to spare her dignity. Now she accused him of trickery.

“Aunt Zhou, you lost fair and square,” Wang Jun interjected. “You’re no match for him.”

Madame Zhou’s eyes blazed. “Who says I can’t handle this brat? I’ll teach him a lesson today!”

Guan Yu smirked. “If you insist, Madame. Let’s settle this.”

They took positions five meters apart. Guan Yu lunged first, launching a flying kick toward her broad chest.

“Good move!” Madame Zhou crossed her arms defensively, bracing for impact.

Wang Jun’s elder sister watched gleefully, phone in hand, eager to film Guan Yu’s humiliation. She resented him for “stealing” her brother’s affection.

Midair, Guan Yu shifted his kick upward as Madame Zhou dodged. His boot clipped her shoulder, sending her stumbling back. She retaliated with a golden-glowing punch, confident he’d retreat.

Instead, Guan Yu met her fist with his own. The collision echoed like thunder—Guan Yu stood firm while Madame Zhou flew backward, blood spraying from her mouth. Her right arm hung numb.

Guan Yu didn’t press the advantage. Madame Zhou collapsed into a flowerbed, crushing delicate blooms.

“Are you unharmed, Madame Zhou?” Lady Shen inquired, more concerned about her ruined garden than the woman.

Though humiliated, Madame Zhou conceded defeat. Guan Yu estimated her cultivation at Second-Level Dual Saint realm—impressive for her age.

Wang Jun bubbled with pride. “You’re incredible!”

Guan Yu merely smiled. Victory over a Dual Saint cultivator meant little. He approached Madame Zhou courteously: “My apologies for the harsh strike.”

“No need, young man.” Madame Zhou’s earlier arrogance vanished, replaced by respect. “True strength deserves recognition.”

As the group returned indoors, Guan Yu inquired about her cultivation techniques, but she deflected. Soon, Lady Shen dragged Madame Zhou off for mahjong, instructing Guan Yu to stay overnight in Wang Jun’s room.

Wang Jun’s sister protested. “Mom! You can’t let him sleep with Jun! What kind of mother-in-law are you?”

Lady Shen shrugged. “Join us for mahjong if you’re jealous.”

Left behind, the sister glared at Guan Yu. “You’re really staying? Mom was just being polite!”

Wang Jun snapped, “Mind your own business!”

“Where would I sleep then?” the sister retorted. “Your bed’s big enough for three.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up at the implication. Wang Jun flushed crimson, desperate to hide their faux relationship.

Realizing the sisters’ complicated dynamic, Guan Yu excused himself. Wang Jun’s heart sank as he left, while her sister smirked triumphantly.

**Chapter 2035: Games People Play**

The sister remained, determined to thwart any intimacy. “Keep your ‘boyfriend’ away from my brother!”

Guan Yu departed, opting not to visit his lover Jinhua. Tomorrow marked Liu Shilei’s final day as principal.

At dawn, Guan Yu and Xue Jing waited outside Kaihuang Academy. Gang members nodded respectfully as they passed.

“Why wait here, Boss?” asked Jia Bo.

“My sister’s last day. I’ll see her off.”

When Liu Shilei arrived, Xue Jing raised a pressing question: “Do humanoid魔族 (demonic tribe) members exist?”

Liu frowned. “Why ask?”

Xue Jing explained their encounter with the demonic Moya at the North Pole, whose death curse caused Guan Yu’s amnesia. Now another girl bore similar seals—possibly from her demonic mother.

“This could reignite ancient conflicts,” Liu murmured. She’d hoped Guan Yu’s memory loss would bring peace, but his destiny intertwined with greater forces.

**Chapter 2036: Schemes Rekindled**

Meanwhile, Feng Jiawei—a relative of the Feng Clan—conspired with Century Garden Academy’s tyrant, Cao Jin. Having failed twice to graduate, Cao ruled the campus through fear and charm, his latest scheme targeting Guan Yu.

In a private dining room, Cao fed morsels to a tall beauty. “Delicious?”

“Better than lunch,” she purred. Cao smiled, savoring his petty kingdom. Soon, their alliance would strike—but Guan Yu’s path, though clouded, would meet its fate.
