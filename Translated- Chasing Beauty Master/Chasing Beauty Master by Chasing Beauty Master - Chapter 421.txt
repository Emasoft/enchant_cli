Spending five million in one go—how could his heart not ache?

However, the thought of forcing Guan Yu to yield and hand over the company made it worthwhile.

Regardless of his feelings, Director Wang on the other end of the phone was overjoyed. As the head of the Immigration Management Office, his position was neither too minor nor particularly lofty, and the perks certainly couldn’t compare to those of other departments.

Those five million New Taiwan Dollars, if converted into salary, would easily cover a decade’s worth of expenses.

He immediately chuckled, “In that case, I’ll thank you on behalf of my wife.”

“And what about our prior agreement…?” Having parted with the money, Wan Qianshan pressed urgently for results.

Wan Qianshan adopted a solemn tone. “It is our duty to rigorously scrutinize every foreigner suspected of illegal entry. Rest assured, this matter is in my hands. Just wait for news, President Wan!”

……

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Lin Dong were driving straight toward Kaohsiung.

Knowing this was Wan Qianshan’s territory, Guan Yu had prepared for a confrontation. Yet he hadn’t anticipated Wan Qianshan would avoid direct conflict, opting instead for an unexpected tactic.

At the highway toll station, several police cars blocked the road, inspecting passing vehicles. When they reached Guan Yu’s group, a bespectacled officer compared a photo in his hand to Guan Yu and barked, “You—out of the car!”

“Officer, is there a problem?”

Seeing the heavily armed officers, Guan Yu obediently stepped out while Lin Dong remained vigilant, ready to strike first if necessary.

“You’ve been reported for illegal entry. Show me your passport!” the officer demanded officiously.

*Reported for illegal entry?* Guan Yu frowned, realizing this was undoubtedly Wan Qianshan’s scheme.

**Chapter 1053: The Inspection**

Who knew the man could be so cunning!

Had Wan Qianshan resorted to underworld tactics—hunting Guan Yu down or obstructing his efforts to rescue Li Xi—Guan Yu could have countered in a hundred ways.

But by using official channels to block the rescue, Guan Yu was cornered. Openly defying the police wasn’t an option.

Moreover, these officers clearly targeted him, likely denying even a chance to search.

When Guan Yu remained silent, the officer waved a hand. “Take him into custody.”

His orders were simply to arrest Guan Yu—reasons were irrelevant.

Guan Yu chuckled bitterly. How efficient—they couldn’t even bother checking passports. Still, he wasn’t worried. Though not Taiwanese himself, a local sat in their car.

Sure enough, as handcuffs snapped shut, Cao Xiping erupted from the vehicle. “You’re arresting him without evidence? What’s your justification?!”

His unmistakable Taiwanese accent made the bespectacled officer frown. “We suspect him of illegal entry and requested his passport. He failed to produce it.”

“Officer, I was merely recalling where I’d placed my passport,” Guan Yu interjected coolly. “You didn’t even let me search before cuffing me. How is that my fault?”

Flustered by the rebuttal, the officer snapped, “I say you don’t have one! Even if you did, we’d need to verify its authenticity at the office.”

“Hey!” Cao Xiping retorted threateningly. “Taiwan values rule of law! You’ll answer for this! If my friend’s passport proves valid, who’ll bear responsibility for delaying urgent matters?”

The officer paled. Guan Yu’s passport was likely legitimate. If Cao took this to the media and sued for abuse of power, consequences would be dire.

Helpless, he glanced toward a nearby police car where Director Wang sat.

Spotting the look, Wang cursed “Useless!” and strode over.

“Report.”

“Sir, this mainlander’s passport is suspect, but he claims urgent business hinders inspection.”

The clever officer deferred to his superior.

“Sir,” Wang addressed Guan Yu authoritatively, “Taiwanese law grants us investigative authority. Even urgent matters require compliance.”

Guan Yu stayed silent as Cao Xiping exploded: “Bullshit! You suspect him? I’ll sue you! Our taxes fund your equipment—is this your gratitude?!”

“Mind your language!” Wang glowered. “I could charge you with verbal assault!”

“Then charge me! Go ahead—”

As the stalemate continued, Guan Yu signaled Lin Dong, who called a number. A cold female voice answered: “Who?”

“A friend of Dongfang Mu needs help in Taiwan.”

After a pause: “Didn’t Xiping handle it?”

Lin Dong tersely explained before stressing: “We’re racing to rescue someone. We need immediate assistance.”

Guan Yu’s greatest fear was Wan Qianshan harming or relocating Li Xi upon realizing the rescue attempt.

Finally, the voice replied: “Understood.”

……

Meanwhile, Wang continued sparring with Cao Xiping—his goal being detainment or delay until Wan Qianshan relocated Li Xi.

Unable to arrest Guan Yu, Wang resolved to stall. An hour or two should suffice.

Then his superior called, ordering him to a Legislative Yuan meeting. Wang’s face fell as he protested: “Sir, I’m occupied—”

“Nothing outweighs this! Attend immediately!” The line went dead.

Trapped, Wang wavered.

Leaving meant failing Wan Qianshan and risking exposure of bribery. Staying meant disobeying his boss.

Suspicion flashed—was this mainlander’s doing?

Gritting teeth, Wang ordered officers: “Take him for passport verification and criminal background check. I suspect he’s a fugitive.”

*Fugitive?* Guan Yu nearly laughed at the absurd charge.

“Help! Illegal arrest! Media! Reporters!” Cao Xiping suddenly bellowed.

**Chapter 1054: The Rescue**

Guan Yu started at Cao’s outburst, baffled by the sudden commotion.

Unbeknownst to him, Taiwanese officials feared journalists above all. The mere threat of exposure made Wang blanch.

As drivers slowed to gawk, Wang shot Cao a venomous glare and fled.

Though bribery evidence existed in a third-party account, journalists digging deeper meant disaster. Choosing lesser evil, Wang retreated.

Guan Yu’s group wasted no time resuming their Kaohsiung journey. Cao’s surveillance showed Li Xi already en route to Keelung.

“I’ll intercept them!” Lin Dong accelerated, but Guan Yu stopped him: “No! Provoking them risks Li Xi’s safety. Track them to their destination.”

Unlike previous highway confrontations, Taiwan wasn’t their turf. Caution prevailed.

“Xiping,” Guan Yu asked, “who is this Jiang person?”

Twice refused assistance, Guan Yu felt slighted—unaccustomed to such treatment even from mainland elites.

“Jiang Yiyi? The Jiang family heiress. Eccentric, but don’t take it personally.”

“How so?”

“Depressive yet not reclusive. Shuns men but gets along with some, like me. Complex condition.”

“Ever sought treatment?”

“Domestic, foreign, even monks and Daoists. Her father offers any wish to her cure’s provider. In Taiwan, Jiangs can accomplish anything. Tragic—she might spiral into severe depression.”

Guan Yu understood the gravity. Her phone manner now made sense—not disdain, but illness.

Noting Cao’s affection, Guan Yu patted his shoulder: “After rescuing my friend, I’ll examine your future wife.”

“She’s not! I see her as a sister—wait, you practice medicine?!”

Guan Yu nodded.

“Seriously?!” Cao eyed the youth skeptically.

Distracted by Li Xi’s plight, Guan Yu ignored the doubt.

……

Guided to a Keelung quarry, they found terrain perfect for ambush—rivers flanking abandoned rocks.

Guan Yu exited shouting: “Wan Qianshan! Show yourself!”

“Hah! Never underestimated you, yet here you are!” Wan Qianshan emerged, dragging bound Li Xi from behind a boulder.

Meeting Guan Yu’s gaze, Li Xi remained silent, eyes inscrutable.

“Release her,” Guan Yu growled, “or suffer beyond imagination.”

“Threats?” Wan Qianshan sneered. “I’ve got insurance!”

At his signal, a dozen armed men materialized—M16 rifles included.

Guan Yu scoffed. “You think these toys can stop us?”

**Chapter 1055: Resolution**

“You’re the dead ones! Look behind!” Wan Qianshan crowed.

As rifles cocked, Cao Xiping nearly collapsed. Guan Yu and Lin Dong remained unfazed—Taiwan’s lax gun laws made this predictable.

Before triggers could pull, Lin Dong blurred into motion—disarming attackers with inhuman speed.

Guan Yu lunged, snatching Li Xi free as Wan Qianshan gaped.

“Impossible! You’re—!”

A single chop to the neck silenced him.

Later, authorities arriving found only unconscious thugs and a signed confession detailing Wan Qianshan’s crimes.

Jiang Yiyi never appeared, but her influence cleared bureaucratic hurdles.

At Taipei’s Jiang estate days later, Guan Yu faced the pale, elegant heiress. “Your methods intrigue me,” she said finally. “Treat my condition, and Jiang resources are yours.”

He smiled. “Let’s begin.”

The game had just expanded.
