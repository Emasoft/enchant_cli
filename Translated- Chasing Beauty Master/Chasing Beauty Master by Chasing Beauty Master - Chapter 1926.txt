“It won’t take long. I guarantee your eyes will fully recover. After a short period of rest, no more than two days, I promise they’ll heal completely without any lasting effects,” Guan Yu assured her.

“For now, you need to cooperate with me. Keep your eyes closed. Soon, you might feel warmth in the injured areas—that’s normal. Understand?” Guan Yu instructed.

Duan Ruxue nodded obediently. The pain had subsided, deepening her trust in him.

Pressing his hands against her forehead, Guan Yu channeled spiritual energy through his palms into her mind. This was his first time healing someone in such a manner, so he proceeded with utmost caution. The energy flowed slowly, and progress was gradual, yet he remained confident in its eventual success.

After some time, Guan Yu withdrew his hands. Duan Ruxue’s left eye, previously swollen and blackened, had now regained its natural skin tone. The swelling had vanished, though crimson streaks still marred the pupil, leaving the eye bloodshot from lingering congestion.

Though his inner energy had alleviated much of the damage, traces remained, requiring further rest. Initially, Duan Ruxue’s left eye had been shrouded in darkness, but faint light now seeped through—a promising sign of recovery.

After Guan Yu’s treatment, Duan Ruxue felt relieved as the pain subsided. Exhausted from a sleepless night, her eyes still bandaged, she succumbed to weariness.

“Keep your eyes closed and still. Don’t strain your left eye—it needs rest. I’ll cover them to shield against harsh light,” Guan Yu said.

Silent and compliant, Duan Ruxue nodded. The discomfort had faded, replaced by trust. She lay back and drifted into deep slumber.

Emerging from the room, Guan Yu decided they couldn’t travel that day. Despite the shabby surroundings, staying put was necessary for Duan Ruxue’s recovery.

“Brother Wan, is she alright?” Jiang Yuan Kai waited anxiously outside, guilt weighing on him. The injury was his doing—any lasting harm would be unforgivable.

“Don’t worry, Brother Jiang. With my treatment, she’ll recover within a day. Rest is crucial now,” Guan Yu replied.

“We’ll stay here today. This incident… it shouldn’t have happened,” Jiang Yuan Kai sighed, regret etched on his face.

“Brother Jiang, the fault lies with Duan Ruxue herself. Yet, it’s fortunate everyone trusts her account,” Guan Yu remarked.

Jiang Yuan Kai glanced at him, sensing an undercurrent. “What do you mean? While her actions caused this, I struck her. Are you implying there’s more to it?”

“Do you truly believe her story? What if she sought you deliberately?” Guan Yu met his gaze.

The two locked eyes until Jiang Yuan Kai ventured, “You think her motives weren’t as they seemed?”

“Perhaps. She may have ulterior motives. Remember, Brother Jiang—you carry a treasure coveted by all. Even Duan Ruxue might desire it,” Guan Yu cautioned.

“Unlikely,” Jiang Yuan Kai muttered. Though skeptical, Guan Yu knew appearances could deceive.

He left the thought hanging, a mere prompt for vigilance. “Brother Jiang, we’ve barely begun this journey, yet already face grave dangers. The Grassland Eleven, long absent from the martial world, have emerged. Troubles will multiply—stay alert. Duan Ruxue, a frail woman without martial skills, infiltrated your room undetected. Imagine if she were an enemy.”

“True. I’ve pondered this. But last night, residual weakness from the poison left me in deep slumber. I didn’t sense her entry,” Jiang Yuan Kai admitted, vowing never to repeat such negligence.

As they walked, Jiang Yuan Kai pressed, “Are you saying Duan Ruxue lied? That her goal is the East Sea Dragon Pearl?”

“Not definitively. But consider: she knew our rooms. If seeking me, why err? If the Duan family possessed the Pearl and the route, why involve us? They’d claim the treasure alone,” Guan Yu reasoned.

Though speculative, he urged caution. Duan Ruxue likely weighed the risks—holding the Pearl would draw relentless foes. Allying with Jiang Yuan Kai offered safer passage. Yet, when treasure surfaced, her true intentions might emerge.

Guan Yu hoped his fears were unfounded, but preparedness was paramount. Crossing him would invite ruthless consequences.

**Chapter 5062: Taking a Disciple**

To Guan Yu, Duan Ruxue was clever yet enigmatic. He sensed her unspoken affections but kept his distance. Should her motives turn treacherous, he’d show no mercy.

The desolate town offered little distraction. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, usually restless, stayed indoors—aware of lurking dangers.

Noticing Qiqi practicing martial forms in the courtyard, Guan Yu and Jiang Yuan Kai approached.

The girl wielded a branch with precision, slicing falling leaves mid-air. She leapt, executed a “Dragon’s Tail Sweep,” and unleashed a combat energy wave, severing a thick branch.

“Remarkable skill for one so young,” Jiang Yuan Kai applauded.

“Her progress surpasses expectations,” Guan Yu smiled.

Qiqi grinned. “I’ve always loved martial arts!”

Jiang Yuan Kai inquired, “Did your grandfather teach you?”

“Grandpa taught acrobatics, not combat. Master Wan taught me everything,” she replied, glancing playfully at Guan Yu.

“Ah, so Brother Wan is your master. I’d hoped to take you as my disciple,” Jiang Yuan Kai said, slightly abashed.

Qiqi chuckled. “Betray my master? Never!”

Jiang Yuan Kai nodded. “A pity. Your talent is rare.”

Guan Yu explained, “I merely gave her cultivation techniques. Her foundation in acrobatics honed her agility.”

He handed Qiqi a note—new cultivation insights. Mastery required her own comprehension.

**Chapter 5063: Never Holding Back**

Flawless techniques meant little without inner energy. Against hordes, stamina trumped skill. True power lay in cultivation depth.

Qiqi’s potential was undeniable. Given time, she’d ascend to greatness.

Yet she lacked a proper weapon. The long sword from Wujian Manor suited her poorly. A short blade would better match her stature, but none was available.

For now, the sword would suffice. Guan Yu resolved to find her a fitting weapon—when fate allowed.
