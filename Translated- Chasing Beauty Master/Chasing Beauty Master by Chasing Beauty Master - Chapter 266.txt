His current state of mind mirrored that of a gambler who had lost everything – consumed by the desperate urge to recoup losses, only to sink deeper into the abyss of obsession until escape became impossible.

Finally, after Guan Yu's evolution, the first energy depletion occurred. He collapsed weakly to the floor.

In the final moment before consciousness faded, a stream of azure light carrying torrents of information surged forth from Feng Xin's body, flooding into Guan Yu's mind.

The room shimmered with soft blue radiance before plunging back into silence.

Unlike compulsive gamblers, fortune seemed to favor Guan Yu slightly more – he might have broken even with some profit to spare.

Early next morning.

Guan Yu's heavy eyelids struggled open to reveal Old Master Feng seated in his wheelchair, face etched with anxiety. "You're awake? What happened?" The elder noticed immediately, concern coloring his voice.

Guan Yu opened his mouth to speak but froze.

An overwhelming cascade of unfamiliar knowledge erupted in his mind – names of medicinal herbs flashed through his consciousness like a film reel, followed by intricate preparation methods. For five full minutes, he stood transfixed, deaf to the elder's calls.

When the mental torrent subsided, Guan Yu's face ignited with fierce exhilaration. Though still exhausted, he sprang upward, driven not by explanation but primal urgency. Rushing to Feng Xin's room (where he already stood), he embraced the anxious woman, showering her forehead with fervent kisses. "Sis! I've found the formula to restore you completely!"

Had her face been visible, it would have burned crimson beneath bandages. The reawakened pain from her burns became irrelevant in this moment.

"Guan Yu," she whispered.

"What is it, sis?"

"Grandfather is here..."

"So what?" Guan Yu retorted boldly, oblivious to his earlier actions.

Old Master Feng coughed pointedly. "I'll return when you've... concluded matters."

Chapter 674: This... This Situation

The listener remained innocent while the speaker's heart raced. Feng Xin thought bitterly that even passion should respect propriety – how could she face others now?

Left alone, endless embarrassment transformed into a coquettish glare. "What were you thinking?" she demanded.

"Excitement overcame me," Guan Yu admitted sheepishly. "I've discovered the restorative formula!"

After acquiring medicinal ingredients through meticulous searching, Guan Yu devoted thirty-six hours to brewing the concoction, his vigil filling the villa with herbal fragrance.

"Grandpa," Guan Yu later explained solemnly, "This formula's efficacy requires personal application. To ensure Sister Xin's complete recovery, I must administer the treatment."

Under the elder's knowing gaze, Guan Yu stood firm. "Medical breakthroughs demand discretion. I'll procure the ingredients myself."

After securing common herbs from various apothecaries, Guan宇 began the arduous alchemical process. For thirty-six unbroken hours, he tended the brew until completion.

The villa steeped in herbal essence.

"Child," Old Master Feng later confided to Feng Xin, "He's labored without rest for your sake."

"Self-inflicted torment," Feng Xin retorted, her heart contradicting harsh words.

When treatment commenced, resolve met vulnerability. As bandages unwound to reveal ravaged skin, resolve wavered. Yet guided by ancient wisdom flowing through him, Guan宇 applied the unguent with sacred precision, energy channeling potent remedies through trembling fingers.

Three weeks later...

"I want to return home for New Year after Sister Xin stabilizes," Guan Yu declared.

"Bring your bride home for the festivities," the elder smiled knowingly.

Thus preparations began – not for one homecoming, but two. First to Liu Shilei's household, where another chapter awaited.
