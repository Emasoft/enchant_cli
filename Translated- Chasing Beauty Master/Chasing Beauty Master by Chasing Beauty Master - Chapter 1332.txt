“Oh?” Young Master Men’s eyes widened with heightened interest as he chuckled, “Didn’t expect you to be so young. I knew it—you look dewy and tender, the kind that makes one’s imagination run wild. Prime goods indeed, heh heh heh.”

Young Master Men thought to himself: Cuihua has already been claimed by Guan Yu, but Xiaobao is also quite a catch. So young—she must be a delightful plaything. Men had always favored naive, pliable girls who were easy to push down and soft to the touch.

“Hurry and sit closer. Let this young master examine you properly.” Men beckoned to Xiaobao, who cleverly smiled and replied, “Young Master Men, perhaps you should order some tea first while we await your friends.”

No sooner had she spoken than Men’s attendant entered from outside. “Second Young Master, I’ve brought your friends as requested.”

Three young scions of prominent families filed into the room—all notorious rich heirs from Qujiang City. Their fathers were wealthy magnates engaged in grand enterprises. Among them was Qin Taijin (Lifting Gold), the eldest son of Men’s maternal uncle’s family.

As the son of a high-ranking official, Men naturally associated with these wealthy second-generation elites. Their gatherings revolved around flaunting rare treasures and boasting of their family fortunes.

Yet Men often found himself at a disadvantage. The City Lord strictly monitored his expenditures, imposing monthly limits. Exceeding these thresholds meant having his funds cut off entirely.

Thus, Men frequently lost face before these pampered heirs. Still, none dared mock him openly—his status commanded respect. Any ridicule remained whispered behind his back.

Among Qujiang’s young masters, Qin Taijin reigned supreme. The Qin family’s vast wealth and business empire earned him universal admiration.

The uncle had named his son “Taijin” (Lifting Gold), hoping the boy would live effortlessly amidst endless riches—a life free from the toil he himself had endured.

Reality matched the uncle’s vision: his son spent lavishly while idling about, pursuing women and shirking responsibilities. Yet the doting father indulged his heir’s every whim, grooming him to inherit the family empire.

Emboldened by this, Qin Taijin grew increasingly brazen. In Qujiang, he acknowledged no superiors, though unlike Men, he avoided outright villainy.

Qin preferred subtle cruelty. He never dirtied his own hands, employing wealth to resolve disputes. If coveting a maiden, he first offered gold. Should she refuse, he arranged her abduction, defiling her while maintaining anonymity.

Thus, outsiders saw Qin as respectable, while insiders knew his bestial nature. His worst crime occurred last summer when he spotted a peasant girl playing by the river. After failing to assault her, he drowned her in the waters.

Fearing exposure, Qin traced her family—mere farmers—and burned their cottage that very night, trapping the elderly couple inside. Witnesses to the riverside crime were paid to disappear permanently from Qujiang.

The girl’s death and the mysterious fire remained unsolved, the case shelved indefinitely. Only Qin’s closest confidants knew the truth.

The uncle doted shamelessly on his only son and daughter. To outsiders, Qin’s willfulness seemed typical of privileged heirs. Recently returned from a pleasure trip where he discarded a paramour, Qin had been admiring erotic paintings at the Zhao residence when Men’s servant summoned him.

“Well now! Young Master Qin honors us with his presence! Haven’t seen you in weeks—thought you’d vanished!” Men rose with a boisterous laugh.

Xiaobao perked up at Qin’s name. Having lived in Qujiang over a year, she knew its gossip well.

Chapter 3442: Wealth and Prosperity

All knew Qin as Qujiang’s wealthiest scion, surpassing even neighboring towns’ elites.

Qin smiled coolly. “How could I refuse your invitation, Young Master Men? Your servant mentioned you’ve acquired a treasure for our appraisal. Naturally, I had to attend.”

“Precisely!” Men grinned. “I obtained a remarkable item yesterday and wished to share it with you all. Your discerning eyes shall judge its worth.”

Three guests had arrived: Qin and the two Zhao brothers.

“Where’s Young Master Li?” Men asked his attendant, disappointed. He’d particularly wanted Li, his closest friend, to attend.

“Second Young Master, Young Master Li is away—reportedly attending a matchmaking meeting.”

“Impossible!” The group gasped. Men laughed incredulously, “That scoundrel? At a matchmaking?”

“Quite plausible,” said Zhao the Elder. “My own father nags constantly about marriage—says I’m overdue to wed some broodmare for heirs. He’s summoned a horde of matchmakers. Ridiculous, no?”

Men shook his head ruefully. “Poor Li—drafted into arranged marriage like you. What an ordeal.”

“Indeed,” Zhao continued. “Li’s a year my senior. His family must be desperate. My father says any fertile woman will do—as if I’d settle for mediocrity!”

Qin smirked. “Your standards aren’t low—merely your character.”

Listening nearby, Xiaobao assessed the Zhaos. Their porcelain business supplied even the capital’s nobility, with imperial commissions testifying to their prestige.

Though Zhao the Elder approached thirty, Xiaobao calculated: marrying this unwed heir would make her first wife, securing influence. Bearing his heir would guarantee favor. Romantic love mattered less than lifelong luxury—prosperity outweighed passion.

“Young Masters, shall we order?” Xiaobao interjected, bending near Zhao with calculated cleavage exposure.

While Zhao remained impassive, Men nearly drooled. Such interruption breached etiquette, but Xiaobao gambled for attention.

Men’s hungry gaze locked on her décolletage as he growled, “Yes, let’s dine. My treat today—none shall dispute this!”

“Unacceptable,” Qin drawled from his seat, chin lifted. “My presence obliges me to host. Would you have me mocked for parsimony?”

Men thought, *Fool! Knew you’d say that. Wealth-addled imbecile.* Aloud, he smiled: “But today celebrates my new treasure! It’s only proper I host. Always you paying—how embarrassing.”

“Nonsense.” Qin waved dismissively at Xiaobao. “Bring Echo Pavilion’s finest dishes and wines until the table groans.”

Xiaobao beamed. “At once, Young Masters.”

Echo Pavilion being relatively new, Qin rarely visited—preferring more opulent venues. This extravagant order for five (including Men’s servant) would waste thirty premium dishes, cementing Qin’s reputation as a profligate fool.

But Xiaobao rejoiced—server commissions depended on sales. Tightfisted patrons often left her unpaid for days until Madam Westwillow instituted profit-sharing.

“Hear that?” Zhao the Younger teased. “Our Qin defines extravagance! ‘Fill the table’—such boldness I’ve never dared!”

Qin smirked. “Why return for leftovers? Sample everything properly.” Though feigning nonchalance, he basked in the flattery.

Chapter 3443: My Treasure

“Naturally,” Men chimed. “In matters of wealth, Qin stands unmatched in Qujiang. I yield completely.” Years of acquaintance taught him Qin’s vanity.

Once outside, Xiaobao fetched Madam Westwillow. “Sister Liu! The Qin heir’s here—ordered every delicacy till the table bursts!”

Madam Westwillow, surprised—Qin had seldom visited since the pavilion’s opening—asked, “Who else attends?”

“Men and the Zhao brothers. Should we rush the kitchen?”

“Immediately! Send extra entertainers too. We must impress these golden geese!” Westwillow scurried off, knowing such patrons ensured prosperity.

Returning, Xiaobao offered, “Shall I perform music while we wait? What instrument pleases Young Masters?”

Zhao the Younger leered, “What can a tender thing like you play?”

Men interrupted, “Xiaobao, attend me.”

Approaching warily—would he grope her?—she asked, “Your command, Young Master?”

Men inhaled her floral scent appreciatively. “Bring tea to the stone table. We’ve matters to discuss.”

At the window-side stone furniture, Men produced a jade Bagua pendant. “Behold my treasure!”

Qin had noticed the jade earlier, assuming it mediocre. Now he inspected it closely with the Zhaos.

Zhao the Elder exclaimed, “This looks familiar...”

Men tensed—what if this was stolen from the Zhaos? “You recognize it?”

“Hmm... Can’t recall where I’ve seen its likeness. Perhaps mistaken.” Zhao had indeed glimpsed it on Yue Jing of Crimson Lotus Sect years prior, but memory failed him.

Relieved, Men boasted, “Nonsense! This jade’s unique—no duplicates exist!”

“A true rarity,” Qin declared. “I’ve seen fine jades, but none so peculiar.”

Men brightened. “You acknowledge its worth?”

Qin nodded. “Unquestionably. The craftsmanship’s singular.”

Men swelled with pride. Finally, validation from Qujiang’s foremost connoisseur.
