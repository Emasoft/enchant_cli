Guan Yu pondered for a moment before replying, "As you've all seen, the stone opening across isn't wide. If we leap recklessly without controlling our momentum, injuries are inevitable. This method ensures everyone's safety."

Wang Xiaorong pushed her way forward, surveyed the gap, and declared, "I've decided—I'll jump straight over. If I leap from here and drop flat on the other side, I won't need to get wet or worry about anything else."

"Jump directly?" Guan Yu eyed her skeptically, gesturing at her attire. "Look how lightly you're dressed! The opposite side is all jagged rock. You'd end up covered in cuts and bruises from crashing onto that surface."

As he spoke, Guan Yu winced at the mental image. With her delicate complexion, Wang Xiaorong would surely be left battered and bloodied if she followed through with such a rash plan.

"Even if I break my legs, it's better than getting soaked! I'm doing this—wait here and watch!" she retorted stubbornly.

Guan Yu hastily yanked her back by the collar, exasperated. "I beg you, young lady, stop causing trouble! Stay put—I'll get everyone across safely."

He then outlined his strategy: "After I cross, I'll secure the landing. Xiao Zhi will unfurl the rope. We'll anchor both ends so you can traverse along it. Those with cultivation can easily manage two meters by channeling a sliver of spiritual energy."

"Brilliant plan!" Wang Xiaorong clapped excitedly.

Guan Yu removed the sack from Aze's shoulders, scavenged some rags, and wrapped them around his limbs for protection. "Wait here," he instructed, retreating several paces for a running start.

*Thud!*

The young man hurled himself across the gap. Though his protective padding cushioned the impact against rough stone, the landing still knocked the wind from his lungs.

"Guan Yu, you're amazing!" Wang Xiaorong cheered, clapping enthusiastically.

"Could you keep your voice down?" Guan Yu hissed, glancing nervously toward the well opening above. After securing the rope between both ledges, the group began crossing—Wang Xiaorong practically floated over with gleeful lightness.

When only Xiao Zhi remained, Guan Yu called, "Just leap! I'll catch you."

The burly man stepped across effortlessly, crashing into Guan Yu with enough force to flatten him. "Gods, you weigh a ton!" the pinned youth wheezed.

The party resumed their formation—twin torches illuminating their path—until they reached a fork where the tunnel split into two diverging passages.

"This complicates matters," Wang Xiaorong sighed. "We've lost all sense of direction."

Guan Yu crouched to examine footprints, but found both paths equally trodden. "Both routes show recent traffic. Our predecessors either divided their forces... or the wrong path claimed an entire group."

"Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors!" Wang Xiaorong suggested, waving her fists. "Last winner chooses!"

Unsurprisingly, her idea met with unanimous eye-rolling.

Trusting his instincts about northern orientation, Guan Yu marked the left passage. As their torches dwindled, he ordered the group to conserve light by holding hands in single file.

Wang Xiaorong clung to Guan Yu's arm despite protests. "I'm staying right beside you!"

Relenting, Guan Yu instructed Siqi to grasp his free hand instead—prompting Wang Xiaorong to hastily interpose herself. The procession shuffled onward until rising heat heralded new dangers.

"Look out—lava!" Guan Yu barked, hauling the group back from a cliff edge overlooking molten rivers. Across the fifteen-meter chasm, another tunnel beckoned.

As they debated directions, Wang Xiaorong's bracelet flared with light, levitating her effortlessly across. "No need for your precious sword techniques!" she taunted mid-flight.

The others followed via sword flight, finding smoother tunnels ahead adorned with colorful luminescent gems. Wang Xiaorong's fingers itched toward a pulsating crystal.

"Don't touch anything!" Guan Yu shouted—too late.

The moment her dagger scraped the prismatic stone, its glow died. A sinister hiss echoed through the passage as poisonous fumes billowed toward them.

"Meditation stances—now!" Guan Yu commanded, dropping to the floor. "Filter the air through spiritual circulation!"

Wang Xiaorong stared guiltily at the darkened gem. "I... I didn't mean to..."

But the creeping vapor permitted no further apologies.
