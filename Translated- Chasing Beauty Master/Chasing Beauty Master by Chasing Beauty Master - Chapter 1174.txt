The Yang family's courtyard had only a single winding driveway, with every other space densely planted with flowers, grass, and trees, filling the air with exceptional freshness.

Having spent days suffocated by the peculiar scent clinging to Young Master Feng in the Feng family's east tower, Bill Lin nearly retched at the memory. Simply escaping that male-dominated environment to tour this scenic place felt like a breath of salvation.

The inner courtyard of the Yang estate revealed meticulous design not only in its architecture but also in the artistic arrangement of surrounding flora. One glance sufficed to recognize the refined taste cultivated by its inhabitants.

A serpentine path led to the innermost front hall, flanked by rows of hibiscus trees. The lawns between them were interspersed with orderly floral patterns, creating an overall impression of deliberately curated beauty.

The Yang residence adhered to classical architectural styles—lofty halls with traditional upturned eaves and layered roofs exuding imposing grandeur.

The two-story front hall stretched over twenty meters east to west. Its magnificence compelled Bill Lin to quicken his pace, eager to discover what lay within.

An elderly attendant led the way. Upon reaching the hall's entrance, he turned and said, “Please enter. The master awaits inside.”

Bill Lin found this puzzling. Rumor claimed Old Master Yang preferred receiving guests in the rear gardens. Why meet at the front hall instead?

**Chapter 3008: Unwilling**

Suppressing questions, Bill Lin stepped into the spacious interior, far exceeding the Feng family’s east tower parlor in scale.

To the left stood solid wood furniture in antiquated styles. At the deepest end, an elderly man sat enthroned on a large chair—undoubtedly Old Master Yang.

Bill Lin promptly clasped his hands in greeting. “Ah, Old Master Yang! How rare this meeting is. My apologies for arriving late, heh heh.”

Old Master Yang regarded him with an impassive gaze, clearly perceiving Bill Lin as a dissipated wastrel whose indolence had ruined his constitution. However, the sharp-eyed elder immediately recognized Luo Bo behind Bill Lin as a formidable expert.

That Bill Lin kept such company was unsurprising. Given the danger surrounding him—particularly covetous eyes on his treasure map from Jianghu opportunists—caution was prudent.

“The eldest son of the Bill family—our first meeting. Sit,” Old Master Yang intoned. “Your companion too. State your purpose. You’ve not come merely for pleasantries.”

Bill Lin sat unceremoniously. “I’ll be direct. A peculiar individual possesses a treasure map I wish to purchase, yet the Yang family repeatedly obstructs my bids.”

“Your accusation baffles me,” Old Master Yang replied coolly. “I’ve neither involved myself nor ordered interference. Explain this claim.”

“At the pawnshop auction for a map fragment, Yang agents drove the price beyond sixty million. Now, during this new bid, your family competes again. This rivalry benefits neither of us—sellers profit while we bleed funds. We should negotiate.”

“One may eat carelessly, but words must not be spoken carelessly,” the elder retorted, sipping tea. “The Yangs have no interest in treasure maps. We’ve dispatched no agents.”

Bill Lin blinked, disconcerted by the denial. Accustomed to sycophantic reverence elsewhere, he bristled at the Yang patriarch’s frosty demeanor and lack of hospitality.

“Setting aside past incidents,” Bill Lin pressed, “your auction house recently outbid me. Does Yang truly desire the map, or merely inflate prices?”

Old Master Yang’s silence deepened his displeasure. He’d expected business discussions, not baseless accusations.

“I repeat—no such orders were given. Do you doubt my word?” The elder’s tone turned glacial.

Luo Bo whispered, “Perhaps sellers fabricated Yang involvement to hike prices.”

Eyes narrowing, Bill Lin demanded, “Then who was the Yang representative at the pawnshop? He called you for instructions!”

“An impostor,” Old Master Yang stated. “I’ve no interest in treasure hunts.”

Realization dawned. “So I’ve been deceived,” Bill Lin muttered.

“Describe this fraud,” the elder urged.

Bill Lin dismissed the matter—his priority was resolving the current bid. “Is your auction house contacting the current map holder?”

“My granddaughter manages auctions. State your intent plainly.”

“Your auction house inflates prices. Since Yang aims to resell it, let’s bypass the theater. I’ll pay you a million to withdraw.”

Old Master Yang calculated silently—equal to potential auction profits but without hassle. “My granddaughter’s approval is needed.”

“Consult her now,” Bill Lin insisted. “I depart after securing the map.”

“Without Yang interference,” the elder mused, “you’d monopolize the bid. Very well—a million upfront, and we abstain.”

Feigning reluctance, Old Master Yang acquiesced. Bill Lin arranged payment and left.

Outside, Luo Bo questioned, “Why yield so much?”

“Securing Yang neutrality is worth the cost,” Bill Lin replied. “Now the map is ours.”

**Chapter 3010: Noodle Shop (Part 2)**

That evening, Guan Yu and Lin Qiaoqiao arrived in her southern hometown—Huzhou, a humid town far from urban bustle.

The streets teemed with life beneath tiled roofs blending antiquity with modern aluminum-framed windows. Flagstone pavements replaced asphalt, flanked by bustling shops.

Dominating a triangular plaza was a thriving eatery—*Yangchun Noodles*—its crowd spilling onto the street.

“This shop’s legendary,” Lin Qiaoqiao explained. “Tourists flock here for their five-yuan bowls. Unbeatable value!”

Guan Yu remained skeptical. “Noodles merit such devotion?”

“Others pale in comparison! Investors beg to franchise it, but the Chens refuse. Authenticity stays here.”

“Why not expand?”

“Tradition,” she shrugged. “Their secret recipe stays in Huzhou. Taste it—you’ll understand.”

As night deepened, the shop’s glow promised culinary revelation—one bowl at a time.
