The force behind this kick was immense. When it collided with Wang Hu’s protective shield, he crossed his arms over his chest, and the shield around him suddenly erupted with dazzling light.

Malgebide’s kick struck Wang Hu’s shield, yet to everyone’s astonishment, the shield completely neutralized the damage. Guan Yu’s eyes lit up in surprise. In just a few short days, Wang Hu had somehow grasped a higher-tier defensive technique. Despite his usual dull and simple demeanor, it seemed Wang Hu was truly a cultivation prodigy.

Malgebide’s technique was flawless, but she had only used fifty percent of her strength. Landing gracefully, her expression betrayed a flicker of shock. She hadn’t expected this seemingly slow-witted youth’s shield to be so formidable—not only had her kick failed to breach it, but the recoil had even left her foot numb.

Guan Yu grew even more curious. Was Wang Hu pretending to be weak all along, or had his shield genuinely improved so drastically? He scrutinized Wang Hu closely and discovered, to his astonishment, that Wang Hu had broken through the Lower Three Venerables realm and reached the Middle Three Venerables. How…?

How had he advanced so swiftly in mere days? Guan Yu pondered. Wang Hu’s current shield clearly possessed a counter-damage effect; otherwise, Malgebide wouldn’t be flexing her foot repeatedly—a clear sign of rebound injury.

Could Wang Hu have mimicked Guan Yu’s shield after watching his match? Impossible. Though Wang Hu specialized in defense, every cultivator’s shield was unique. If simply observing a match allowed one to replicate techniques, wouldn’t everyone master them overnight?

**Chapter 1910: Defeat**

Yet perhaps Wang Hu’s innate talent for shields was exceptional enough to glean insights from Guan Yu’s techniques. Previously, Wang Hu’s white shield had clung tightly to his body, but now, emulating Guan Yu, it formed an eggshell-like barrier around him.

The color of Wang Hu’s shield gradually shifted from white to yellow, mirroring the hue Guan Yu’s shield had taken when he first conceptualized the “eggshell” defense in Xue Jing’s courtyard days ago.

Guan Yu nodded silently. Wang Hu was undoubtedly a rare gem. Who would have guessed this typically sluggish youth harbored such extraordinary cultivation talent?

With proper mentorship, Wang Hu’s future would be limitless. Meanwhile, Malgebide launched another assault. Her hand sharpened into a blade, striking a single point on Wang Hu’s shield with relentless, drill-like speed.

Malgebide was no fool. Concentrating her attacks on one spot was the most efficient way to shatter his defense.

Wang Hu’s face tightened. Suddenly, his eyes widened as if struck by inspiration. To everyone’s shock, he crossed his arms again and began spinning rapidly in place. Malgebide frowned—this rotation made targeting a single point impossible.

Wang Hu’s spinning accelerated, soon resembling a giant whirling egg at the arena’s center. Guan Yu stifled a laugh. This Wang Hu was full of surprises.

Yet Wang Hu was no match for Malgebide. Seeing his stubborn resistance, she abandoned restraint. With a sweep of her arms, she clasped her hands before her chest, dark energy coalescing around them. “**Break!**” she roared.

A black dragon-like streak of energy erupted, roaring toward Wang Hu. The crowd gasped—this technique demanded at least Upper Three Venerables cultivation!

Guan Yu remained calm; he’d long sensed her prowess. The collision sent Wang Hu flying five meters before crashing against the steel wall. Blood sprayed from his lips upon impact, yet faint traces of his shield lingered—proof he’d pushed his defensive arts to the limit.

Too weakened to stand, Wang Hu felt utterly hollow. The judge declared, “Malgebide of Lanzhe Academy wins! Lanzhe leads Kaihuang Academy 1–0.”

Malgebide descended to thunderous applause, her prowess earning respect. As Guan Yu debated sending aid, Wang Hu staggered upright—another revelation. Despite specializing in defense, he’d developed rapid healing!

Guan Yu’s admiration deepened. “Well done, Wang Hu. Today’s performance was exceptional,” he praised sincerely, resolved to mentor this unique prodigy.

**Chapter 1911: Teach Him a Lesson**

Next, Lanzhe’s principal sent Lu Xuan to draw lots, hoping she’d face Guan Yu and concede gracefully. Lu Xuan—Lanzhe’s campus belle—approached nervously, selecting a envelope. Her face fell: her opponent was Zhang Han, not Guan Yu.

“Damn it!” Lanzhe’s principal cursed, slamming the table. A tie now seemed improbable.

Zhang Han shoved her snacks into Guan Yu’s arms. “Guard these, Uncle! No stealing!” she chirped before skipping to the arena. The crowd erupted at the sight of two beauties clashing.

Lu Xuan, pale as porcelain, possessed an ethereal, doll-like charm. Yet her cultivation—barely Three Venerables—was no match for Zhang Han’s eager onslaught. Within moments, Lu Xuan yielded gracefully.

“Let’s be friends!” Zhang Han chirped post-match. “Want me to set you up with my uncle Guan Yu? He collects beauties—you qualify!”

The audience jeered. “Since when does Guan Yu hoard all the girls?!”

Lu Xuan declined coldly, unaware this “collection” remark stemmed from Zhang Han’s childish mischief. Guan Yu endured glares from envious spectators as Zhang Han returned, smug.

“I found you a new beauty! Reward me!” she demanded, resuming her snack feast.

Onlookers like Yang Conghan and Lan Yu fumed. “That idiot’s gifting him more women?!”

**Chapter 1912: No Sportsmanship**

Next, Yang Hua—who’d earlier tried framing Zhang Han—faced Chen Tianxiao. “Teach him a lesson,” Guan Yu urged.

Chen Tianxiao nodded. During handshakes, he whispered, “Guan Yu asked me to humble you.”

Yang Hua smirked. “We’ll see who humbles whom.”

The match began with Yang Hua launching a dishonorable sneak attack, overwhelming Chen Tianxiao momentarily. Regaining footing, Chen Tianxiao levitated, his form blurring like mist. Yang Hua’s strikes phased harmlessly through him as azure lightning gathered in Chen Tianxiao’s palms...
