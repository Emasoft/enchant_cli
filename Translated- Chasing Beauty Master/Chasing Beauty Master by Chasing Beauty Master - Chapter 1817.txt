Guan Yu's contributions to the Cloud Azure Sect were indeed monumental. The crossbow project alone had significantly elevated the sect's overall strength. At their current forging pace, it wouldn't be long before every Cloud Azure disciple carried one of these weapons. Once fully equipped, the sect's combat prowess would become extraordinary.

Even the formidable Demon Soul Sect would struggle to contend with them. However, Xuan Ming remained unaware that Wang Xiaorong already possessed an exquisitely crafted crossbow. Whether the Demon Soul Sect had begun mass production remained uncertain.

If the Demon Soul Sect indeed pursued large-scale manufacturing, it wouldn't be difficult with Wang Xiaorong's prototype as reference. Guan Yu cared little about future developments – eventually all sects would likely adopt crossbows, making them highly sought-after artifacts. Yet mass production presented challenges.

Though deceptively simple in appearance, crossbow craftsmanship involved intricate complexities. Even Master Wang from True Sun Sect, personally instructed by Guan Yu, had struggled with the process. Considering Master Wang's decades of expertise, few others could replicate this feat without hands-on guidance.

After returning to True Sun Sect, Master Wang would undoubtedly prioritize material acquisition. Crossbow proliferation held equal importance for them.

To reward Guan Yu, Xuan Ming had even relinquished the Frost Silk Counter-Armor – an unprecedented gesture. No other disciple, elder, or even peak lord had ever received such a treasure. In Xuan Ming's esteem, Guan Yu now surpassed everyone, especially the increasingly disappointing Lin Chen and Ling Su.

"Guan Yu," Xuan Ming declared, "my expectations of you run high. The Cloud Azure Sect is fortunate to nurture talent like yours."

"It's my honor to serve the sect," Guan Yu replied solemnly, though privately he felt no allegiance. The sect served as convenient shelter – better to thrive under its protection than wander alone. Without Xuan Ming, he'd never have acquired such treasures.

His true ambition lay in elevating Wujian Manor and Xiaomei's faction to rival Cloud Azure. "Master," Guan Yu inquired, "the Eternal Ice Lotus originates from Crimson Lotus Sect. How did we obtain material for this armor?"

Xuan Ming stroked his beard. "Generations past, Crimson Lotus's former patriarch rescued someone who gifted the lotus in gratitude. It's been stored in an icy cavern ever since – too frigid for most to approach."

"But recently," Guan Yu countered, "Demon Soul agents infiltrated that cavern using Fire Gu insects. I heard a Crimson Lotus elder permanently resides there. How does he withstand the cold?"

"He's afflicted," Xuan Ming revealed. "Decades ago, Demon Soul's Left Envoy wounded him with Fire Gu poison. The icy cavern suppresses the burning toxicity. He survives by balancing the elements but cannot leave long."

Guan Yu recalled the Wolf King of demonic tribes imprisoned beneath the lotus. The poisoned elder now guarded both prisoner and treasure.

When discussing sect strengths, Xuan Ming explained, "Major sects conceal their true numbers of elders and experts. Cloud Azure's full roster remains unknown, as does Crimson Lotus's – though their Zhao Elder demonstrated remarkable power in Miao City."

Chapter 4755: Get the Hell Out of Here

Guan Yu pressed about Cloud Azure's elders: "I know of four – Seventh, Eighth, Ninth..."

Xuan Ming chuckled mysteriously. "Heaven's secrets aren't for divulging. Attend to your preparations."

"Master," Guan Yu reminded, "you promised me White Mystic Steel for arrows."

"Get the hell out of here!" Xuan Ming snapped, eyeing him sideways. "You've already taken my Frost Silk Armor! My heart bleeds enough – no more gifts! Solve your own problems!"

Chapter 4756: Changing Scales

Retreating from the fuming sect leader, Guan Yu descended the mountain. He bypassed Siqi to avoid her insistence on accompanying him, instructing Wang Jun instead.

Red Mountain's summer foliage blazed crimson as Guan Yu arrived. Xiaomei greeted him excitedly at the base, coordinating construction materials. "Du Teng's resources arrived!" she exclaimed, dragging him uphill.

The crude existing structures – some mere thatched huts – needed complete overhaul. "We'll demolish everything," Guan Yu declared. "Proper buildings for training halls, armories, and living quarters."

Xiaomei frowned. "But dismantling will delay our relocation."

"Strong foundations first," Guan Yu insisted. "Have Du Teng send more craftsmen. We'll build simultaneously on multiple peaks."

As they planned, caravan after caravan arrived with supplies. Guan Yu surveyed the three-peaked territory – soon to be renamed Jia Yi Sect. "Prioritize defensive structures," he instructed. "We'll need fortifications before announcing our presence."

Chapter 4757: Total Reconstruction

"Wait," Xiaomei interjected. "What about temporary shelters during construction?"

"Tents on the eastern slope," Guan Yu decided. "Better to endure short-term hardship for lasting strength. I'll have Wang Jun send provisions."

Their discussion lasted until sunset. Guan Yu knew time pressed – he needed to visit Wang Xiaorong soon. Only with Demon Soul Sect's tacit approval could their fledgling sect survive initial challenges.

As night fell, Guan Yu outlined security measures: "Post sentries along all approach paths. Until our gates stand, we're vulnerable." The mountain echoed with hammers as reconstruction began – the birth pangs of a new power.
