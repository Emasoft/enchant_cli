The next day in class, Guan Yu learned that Pan Xiaoxia had taken a sick leave. Worried that the rhythm of their cultivation might have been disrupted, he feared the uncontrolled energy within her body might have rebelled and harmed her.

At noon, Guan Yu requested an afternoon leave. As soon as he stepped out of school, he spotted a Hummer SUV approaching from afar. "Damn, it's Lan Yu again," he muttered. That girl was clingy beyond measure. He hurried toward a nearby café to hide.

"Guan Yu! Where do you think you're running?" A sharp female voice pierced the air. Too late—she’d spotted him.

Lan Yu’s Hummer screeched to a halt inches from him. She leaped out, demanding, "You took the afternoon off! I rushed here the moment I heard. What’s the plan? Taking me out?"

Guan Yu groaned inwardly. How had she found out within ten minutes of his request? Were these people omniscient?

"Who said I took leave? I just wanted coffee before class," he lied.

"Really? My intel’s wrong?" She shrugged. "Fine. Let’s drink together." She latched onto his arm.

So she had spies at Kaikang Academy too. "Enough! I’ve got urgent business. Stop this!"

"I’ll drive you. Maybe I can help."

Knowing she’d never relent, Guan Yu sighed. "Hongqiao Apartments."

At Pan Xiaoxia’s door, repeated knocks went unanswered. Guan Yu kicked the reinforced steel door open, thrilling Lan Yu, who thrived on chaos.

"Thrilling!" she whispered.

They found Pan unconscious in her bedroom. Guan Yu checked her pulse—faint, nearly stopping. "Lan Yu! Fill the bathtub with 50°C water. Now!"

As Lan Yu rushed to comply, Guan Yu sat facing Pan, palms pressed to hers. Channeling his internal energy into her, he recoiled in horror. The rampaging pure Yin energy had nearly shredded her meridians, retaliating violently against her weakened body.

"The water’s ready!"

Guiding their levitating bodies into the steaming bath, Guan Yu ignored Lan Yu’s awed gasp: "You can fly? Teach me!"

"Remove her clothes!"

"What?!"

"Now!"

With Pan exposed, Guan Yu shielded her heart meridian and wrestled the Yin energy into his own body. The invasive force surged wildly, merging with his energy until it liquefied—a cultivation breakthrough.

Memories flickered—scenes from a past life as a Realm Sovereign. Suppressing the Yin energy, he finally absorbed it completely.

Hours later, Guan Yu revived Pan’s repaired meridians while Lan Yu slept by the door. At 8 PM, exhausted, he meditated on the couch until Lan Yu’s nightmare scream startled him.

Pan’s brother Taisheng arrived, suspicious until Guan Yu explained. When asked about the broken door, Guan Yu admitted: "I’ve no cash."

Lan Yu offered her card, but Taisheng waved it off.

Later, fleeing pursuers in her Hummer, Lan Yu joked about "dating" Guan Yu to escape her father’s guards. Her outrageous claim of pregnancy left Guan Yu speechless—a typical Lan Yu gambit to dodge responsibility.

As headlights pursued them through the night, Guan Yu realized this chaotic bond might unlock more forgotten memories from his celestial past.
