At the time, the Demonic Sect was still in its prosperous era. Although the Four Blood Fiends harbored ulterior motives, they remained united against the orthodox sects. Yet within a few years, the Demonic Sect suffered a crushing defeat, routed by the righteous factions, ultimately fading into obscurity within the jianghu.

However, the Left Envoy remained steadfast by the Demon Lord's side, cultivating his arcane arts. To this day, the Demon Lord remained the most formidable existence in the Left Envoy's mind—a conviction unshaken even now.

Though shrewd-minded, the Left Envoy possessed shortsighted vision. The Demon Lord had long been enshrined in his heart as an invincible colossus, an object of boundless reverence.

Over these many years within the Soulfiend Sect, the Demon Lord had treated the Left Envoy generously—not only imparting powerful techniques but gifting him a custom-forged magical artifact crafted specifically for his use.

The Left Envoy believed the Demon Lord might well be the most formidable entity in the jianghu. None could defeat him, let alone surpass him.

The Demon Lord's cultivation was no trivial matter. The Left Envoy's veneration had roots: in terms of arcane mastery, if the Demon Lord claimed second place in the jianghu, none dared claim first. This was why the Ghoulfiend Cavern feared the Soulfiend Sect—indeed, not only Ghoulfiend Cavern but even the Bloodhunt Sect avoided direct confrontation.

“I’ve obtained crucial news. Remember that maid we planted in the Qin household?” West Peach Blossom inquired.

“Of course. She’s our operative from Ghoulfiend Cavern—how could I forget?”

West Peach Blossom continued, “Today she reported that Qin Taijin was severely injured. This morning alone, over a dozen Qin Manor guards were slaughtered—likely the Soulfiend Sect’s doing. That Steward Sun is one of theirs. Seizing the opportunity, she’s arranged thirty more guards in the manor, all Soulfiend Sect members.”

“Such audacity? What could the Soulfiend Sect want in Qin Manor? Merely to deal with a few Cloud Azure Sect disciples? This seems excessive,” West Willow mused skeptically.

“Unclear. But the Demon Lord’s Left Envoy has always been inscrutable. Their mass infiltration must conceal deeper schemes. I’ve ordered our agent to report developments immediately.”

West Willow asked, “Sister, how fare your external arrangements?”

“I’ve embedded operatives within the Soulfiend Sect. Though infiltrating the Demon Lord’s inner circle proves difficult, we now monitor Duobao Mountain’s situation closely. Any movement will be detected instantly.”

“After painstakingly establishing our foothold here, who could foresee this turn? Our progress was excellent until the Left Envoy exposed us. It seems Heaven itself opposes Ghoulfiend Cavern’s resurgence,” West Willow lamented, despondency coloring her tone.

West Peach Blossom retorted, “No—we cannot abandon this front. Matters may not be as dire as we fear.”

“Does Elder Sister have a solution?” West Willow perked up. Cuihua also straightened attentively.

A ruthless glint entered West Peach Blossom’s eyes. “First method: kill the Left Envoy. Prevent his departure from this place.”

“Too difficult,” West Willow shook her head. “Even if we join forces against him, he might still escape. A full assault by our sisters would create excessive commotion, with no guarantee of success.”

West Peach Blossom acknowledged the peril. Failure to eliminate the fleeing Left Envoy would mean irrevocable enmity with the Soulfiend Sect. West Willow spoke true—if the Left Envoy focused solely on escape, retaining him would prove near impossible.

“The second method,” she continued, “is to do nothing. Let the Left Envoy act as he will while we continue developing here.”

“Elder Sister jests?” West Willow gaped incredulously. Discovery by the Soulfiend Sect would end their operations—leaving only two fates: absorption into the sect under the Demon Lord’s rule, or suppression.

**Chapter 3,498: Careful Consideration**

“The Demon Lord likely lacks leisure to oppose us now,” West Peach Blossom asserted. “After years cultivating this base with Duobao Mountain’s movements imminent—for Ancestor Menghua’s legacy and the Eight-Sided Drum Art—we cannot abandon this.”

“For Ghoulfiend Cavern’s future, we must obtain the Eight-Sided Drum Art. Even submitting to the Demon Lord is preferable to withdrawal,” she declared resolutely.

West Willow fretted, “After decades in shadows, sudden exposure would draw not just the Soulfiend Sect’s attention but Bloodhunt’s malice too. Are you certain of our safety?”

“If our sisters suffer harm,” West Willow added painfully, “I’d rather forfeit the Eight-Sided Drum Art.”

Ghoulfiend Cavern’s prolonged obscurity stemmed from weak capabilities. The Demoness Sisters’ cultivation remained mediocre, compounded by their sect’s arduous training methods failing to produce outstanding disciples over generations.

Gradual decline reduced Ghoulfiend Cavern to its current state. Now, the Demoness Sisters desperately sought the Eight-Sided Drum Art—hoping its power could elevate their sect to eventual resurgence.

“Never assume the worst,” West Peach Blossom reasoned. “Duobao Mountain’s situation grows complex—orthodox and demonic factions converge, war imminent. The Demon Lord likely lacks inclination for conflict now. Attacking us would bring him no advantage during this critical juncture.”

“You claim the Soulfiend Sect won’t move against us even if discovered? Are you certain?” West Willow worried. “I’ll not gamble with our sisters’ lives.”

“Were I the Demon Lord, I’d avoid antagonizing potential allies during manpower shortages. Crushing Ghoulfiend Cavern would cost eight hundred losses for a thousand gains—futile effort he’d surely avoid.”

West Peach Blossom sipped tea. “Moreover, he’d first attempt recruitment. Should we refuse while declaring neutrality in sect conflicts, he’d likely acquiesce.”

West Willow nodded slowly. “True. The Demon Lord is shrewd. With forces deployed for Ancestor Menghua’s legacy and impending clashes, he’d avoid provoking us now.”

“Precisely,” West Peach Blossom agreed. “He fears driving us to ally with orthodox factions—a risk he must weigh.”

Cuihua brightened. “So we needn’t fear the Demon Lord? We can remain here?”

“Not so simple,” West Peach Blossom cautioned. “This is merely our assumption. Even if events favor us, our stay here cannot last long—though likely secure until Ancestor Menghua’s legacy emerges.”

The Left Envoy had recognized West Peach Blossom on the stairs. Returning to his table, he drank leisurely while awaiting Cuihua’s return, contemplating how news of Ghoulfiend Cavern’s presence would please the Demon Lord.

“Young Master, apologies for the wait. Our proprietress will receive you now,” announced Cuihua, entering with a smile.

“Oh?” The Left Envoy feigned surprise, having expected avoidance given Ghoulfiend Cavern’s secrecy.

West Willow entered, smiling. “How unexpected—the Azure Dragon Left Envoy graces us. Shameful I failed to properly welcome you earlier.”

“Elder Sister flatters me. I merely chanced upon your domain,” the Left Envoy rose courteously. “Please, sit.”

Internally, he marveled at West Willow’s boldness. Had Ghoulfiend Cavern chosen surrender?

“Cuihua, leave us. No disturbances,” West Willow commanded.

As the maid departed, the Left Envoy glanced warily at the exit. Was this a trap? Yet escape via third-story window remained feasible.

Noticing his suspicion, West Willow laughed. “Fear not, Left Envoy. Only you know my identity here. These girls are uninvolved—I’ll not drag them into our affairs.”

Her words ostensibly distanced the brothel’s staff from sect matters. The Left Envoy smirked. “Jests, Elder Sister? Can Ghoulfiend Cavern number only the Demoness Sisters? None would believe it.”

“Your words discomfort me,” West Willow replied coldly. “Ghoulfiend Cavern has disciples, but these workers aren’t among them. Our strongholds lie elsewhere.”

“How impressive—your influence grows,” the Left Envoy mocked, disbelieving their meager forces could achieve much.

**Chapter 3,499: Facing Reality**

“Truthfully, this is merely a temporary outpost for monitoring Duobao Mountain regarding the Eight-Sided Drum Art. My sister West Peach Blossom maintains our true base elsewhere—she rarely visits.”

West Willow’s half-truths found purchase. Establishing a brothel to observe Duobao Mountain aligned with logical tactics.

“All these years, the Demon Lord sought you fruitlessly. Who knew you’d rooted here so deeply?” The Left Envoy poured wine. “Your vintage excels, I admit.”

“Flattery noted. Visit daily for discounts,” West Willow drank boldly. “We’ve long known of the Demon Lord’s search. Refusing to become Soulfiend cannon fodder, we severed ties—hiding for decades to escape demonic entanglements.”

The Left Envoy drained his cup. “Why persist, Elder Sister? Years of evasion end with my discovery. The Demon Lord remains disposed to nurture you—why resist?”

“Absurd!” West Willow scoffed. “Were it not for our designs on the Eight-Sided Drum Art and this brothel front, could Soulfiend’s incompetents have found us?”

Though stung, the Left Envoy pressed, “Your temper sharpens with age. You claim neutrality, yet pursue Ancestor Menghua’s legacy—founder of the ancient Demonic Sect. Isn’t this participation?”

West Willow stood, outmatched in verbal sparring. “The Eight-Sided Drum Art belongs to history. In this era, destiny determines its master—all cultivators covet it. Soulfiend Sect holds no exclusive claim.”

“So Ghoulfiend Cavern opposes us?” The Left Envoy’s tone hardened, dreading conflict.

“We’ve never opposed Soulfiend,” West Willow countered. “Our existence doesn’t hinder you. Submission to the Demon Lord is impossible, but we’ll not obstruct your pursuit of the Art.”

“Such words would find scant acceptance before the Demon Lord,” the Left Envoy warned. With Duobao Mountain’s tensions nearing eruption, absorbing Ghoulfiend’s forces as expendable troops would prove useful.

“Perhaps. But currently, the Demon Lord lacks leisure to oppose us—don’t you agree?” West Willow probed meaningfully.

The Left Envoy conceded silently. With Soulfiend forces preparing to enter Duobao Mountain tonight or tomorrow, the Demon Lord indeed couldn’t spare resources against Ghoulfiend now. Provoking them risked defection to orthodox factions—a disastrous scenario.

Now understanding West Willow’s boldness stemmed from reading Soulfiend’s precarious position, the Left Envoy smiled ruefully. “Elder Sister’s foresight impresses. Ghoulfiend’s fearlessness derives from our current weakness.”

Moreover, accepting West Willow’s claim of this being merely an outpost, annihilating it would gain little while wasting effort—a losing proposition.

“You jest, Left Envoy,” West Willow smiled. “None surpass your cunning as the Demon Lord’s trusted envoy. Your presence in Qujiang City surely heralds major events?”

The Left Envoy sipped wine pensively as she pressed, “Why does Soulfiend Sect infiltrate Qin Manor so heavily? Merely targeting Cloud Azure disciples seems disproportionate.”
