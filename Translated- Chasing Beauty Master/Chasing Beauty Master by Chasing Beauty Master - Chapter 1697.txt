**Chapter 4439: I Understand**

Afterward, Lin Chen began assigning rooms. Guan Yu had initially suggested they split up to better care for the martial brothers staying at another inn. But Lin Chen refused, persistently making excuses to stay near Siqi. Guan Yu eventually relented, reasoning that everyone present was mature enough to handle themselves and that no trouble would arise.

When distributing room keys at the inn, Lin Chen slyly reserved a room adjacent to Siqi’s. Siqi, as always, occupied a single room. Guan Yu noted with frustration that all seven rooms in the small inn were fully occupied, leaving him no choice but to squeeze into a cramped space with Wang Jun and A’ze. He ended up resting on two chairs pushed together.

By the next morning, the sun had already risen high. Everyone slept late except Guan Yu, who awoke earlier due to a disruptive noise outside—a rhythmic *clacking* resembling wood-chopping that began at dawn. Though irritated by the disturbance, Guan Yu tolerated the inn’s poor conditions. Surprisingly, Wang Jun and A’ze slept soundly, oblivious to the racket.

Venturing downstairs, Guan Yu found the common area empty. Following the noise to the backyard, he pushed open a creaking door to discover a small courtyard. Leaning against the fence were their camels, neatly arranged by the innkeeper. Nearby stood a middle-aged woman splitting thick logs into firewood. Hearing his approach, she turned and greeted, “Guest, did you rest well?”

Guan Yu observed her work—a widow, he surmised—as she swung an axe with practiced ease. A boy of about ten darted out from a side door. “Mother, let me carry the firewood!”

“Xiaoming, just stack these by the stove,” the woman instructed.

Guan Yu apologized for his earlier presumption. The woman, wiping sweat from her brow, explained, “I’ve grown accustomed to handling everything alone. The cold nights require ample firewood.”

“I understand,” Guan Yu replied. “Your son seems quite helpful.”

“He is,” she said fondly. “Xiaoming lightens my burdens.”

Learning the inn served no meals, Guan Yu set out to find breakfast. He soon discovered better-equipped inns nearby and marveled at Lin Chen’s choice of lodgings—clearly selected for cheapness over comfort. Resolving to retaliate, Guan Yu located a bustling steamed bun shop two streets away.

The shop boasted eighty-eight filling varieties, from mundane pork to exotic python and crocodile. After perusing the menu, Guan Yu reserved tables and returned to gather the group.

**Chapter 4440: Saving Your Coins**

Lin Chen’s face paled upon seeing the grand establishment. “Such a place will bleed my purse dry!” he muttered.

Guan Yu feigned innocence. “You insisted on frugality. What’s cheaper than steamed buns?”

Inside, the group marveled at the lavish spread. Lin Chen’s dismay deepened as Guan Yu ordered premium fillings and side dishes. “Eat well,” Guan Yu declared. “We’ll need strength for the desert tomorrow.”

**Chapter 4441: Unbearable Conditions**

Later, visiting the second inn where other martial brothers stayed, Guan Yu grimaced. The converted stable reeked of neglect. “Tonight, we find better quarters,” he announced.

Lin Chen protested weakly, but the group cheered Guan Yu’s decision. As they settled into the bustling bun shop, Lin Chen calculated costs in despair while others indulged. Siqi, clutching her jade ruyi adorned with a golden flower, smiled—a gift from Guan Yu that she treasured both sentimentally and for its cultivation benefits.

The aroma of steaming baskets filled the air as Chapter 4441 closed on Lin Chen’s financial dread and the group’s fleeting contentment before their harsh desert journey.
