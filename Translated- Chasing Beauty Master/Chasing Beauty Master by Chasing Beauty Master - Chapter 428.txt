The last time he went to the Imperial College club, the suit Wenqing bought him had only been worn once.

Yet, his opinions had never carried much weight among those like Wenqing. Feng Xin said indifferently, “This was chosen by Sister Shilei. Whether you wear it or not is your choice.”

**Chapter 1070: Wenya’s Purpose in Coming to the Capital**

“It’s fine if you don’t want to wear it,” Liu Shilei said understandingly, though a faint threat lingered in her expression. *Damn, for 1'51 Book Network I’ll just say this: our update speed is n times faster than other sites, with fewer ads.*

“I’ll wear it! I’ll wear it, alright?” Guan Yu grumbled, reluctantly taking the suit.

Sigh. Being around Feng Xin had even made his dear Shilei pick up the habit of threatening him.

“Brother, let me tell you—the day after tomorrow, Sister Shilei is attending a class reunion. If you refuse to wear it, plenty of others will fight to!”

“Exactly! Someone as beautiful as Sister Shilei could easily find another man to wear her clothes!” Mo Ling added, kicking him while he was down.

Without hesitation, Guan Yu slapped her soft rear and growled, “Any man daring to wear my wife’s clothes will lose his hands!”

Mo Ling stomped her foot, face flushed, and retreated to a corner.

“Sister Shilei, you must have many male classmates. Any better than Guan Yu? If so, just dump him!” Wenqing chimed in playfully, earning herself a light smack from Guan Yu.

“Someone as lovely as Sister Shilei must have countless suitors!” Zhao Jing’er remarked.

Liu Shilei glanced subconsciously at Guan Yu. “Not many. Stop talking nonsense.”

“Husband’s in for a headache now,” Feng Xin gloated.

Guan Yu nearly wept. Were these wives so eager to see him humiliated? They deserved a spanking.

Noticing the dangerous glint in his eyes, Wenqing quickly changed the subject. “Husband, you mentioned a sucker treating us to dinner. Who is it?”

Since returning to the capital, Wenqing had acted the demure lady. But when with Mo Ling and Feng Xin, she turned bold—teasing Guan Yu and even uttering words like “sucker,” much to his exasperation.

“A rich heir I met in Jiangnan. Remember: order the priciest dishes and eat your fill. No mercy!”

“Free food? We’re in!” Zhao Jing’er cheered first.

Wenqing, Mo Ling, and Feng Xin rubbed their hands, eager to feast. Only Liu Shilei hesitated. “Guan Yu, isn’t this... improper?”

She felt taking advantage of a friend was wrong.

Wenqing read her thoughts. “Sister Shilei, don’t you see? Look at Husband’s face—they’re not friends! Eat guiltlessly. We’ve shopped all morning and deserve a meal.”

“Alright,” Liu Shilei conceded.

“Let’s go then.” Guan Yu strode out but was halted by a chorus: “Stop! Come back for the bags.”

Sighing, Guan Yu obediently draped himself with shopping bags.

**---**

The Dynasty Hotel, renowned on Wangfujing Street, boasted five-star luxury. Business elites saw it as a status symbol. Zheng Chaoyang frequented it with friends during Beijing visits.

Today was no exception. After meeting his father’s friend, he headed to the VIP suite with Wenya, muttering, “That bastard dared challenge me. Just wait till he arrives.”

Qin Tian added fuel, “Guan Yu’s flaw is his arrogance. Though he’s my friend, a little lesson won’t hurt.”

Wenya frowned, realizing Qin Tian’s gentlemanly facade hid pettiness.

Entering the private room, they found a middle-aged man ordering. “Xiao Yang, you’re late!”

“Apologies, Uncle Zhang. A fool delayed us. My treat today.” Zheng Chaoyang introduced Wenya, Chen Si, and Qin Tian. “This is Wang Sibin, CEO of Huanya Entertainment—my dad’s closest friend.”

Wenya and Chen Si greeted politely, mindful of their entertainment ambitions.

Wang Sibin, deceptively ordinary, eyed them with lecherous appraisal—especially Wenya. “Sit. Order anything. My treat.”

Zheng Chaoyang protested, “Uncle Wang, I insisted—”

“Enough. Your dad would scold me otherwise.” Wang Sibin turned to the girls. “You two seek acting roles? I’ve two ad leads unfilled. Perfect for you. Come for auditions tonight.”

The blatant proposition darkened Qin Tian’s face. He glanced at Zheng Chaoyang, who shook his head subtly. Qin Tian stayed silent—Wenya wasn’t worth offending a mogul.

Wenya and Chen Si exchanged uneasy looks. Their Beijing trip now reeked of deceit.

“Could we audition this afternoon?” Wenya asked.

Wang Sibin scowled. “I’m busy. Problem with tonight?”

Chen Si interjected, “We’ll be there!” She’d call friends for backup if needed.

Wang Sibin smirked. “My company has top directors. Obey, and you’ll shine.”

**Chapter 1071: The Banquet**

“Xiao Yang, who’d you meet earlier?” Wang Sibin inquired.

“Some fool who pursued Wenya. No threat—just a pauper,” Zheng Chaoyang dismissed.

“Good. Let me know if he troubles you. Nothing escapes my reach in Beijing.”

“Thank you, Uncle Wang.”

Zheng Chaoyang checked his watch. “I invited him, but he’s probably chickened out.”

Guan Yu’s drawl echoed, “Skip a free meal? Wouldn’t want to disappoint you.”

He entered with Wenqing’s entourage. Every man present gaped—stunning beauties outshining even Wenya. Wang Sibin marveled; these girls surpassed his fame-hungry models.

Zheng Chaoyang compared Chen Si to the newcomers, seething with envy. Where’d this brat find such women?

Qin Tian shot Wenya a questioning look. She stared blankly at Guan Yu, regret gnawing her. Had she accepted him earlier, perhaps she’d share those women’s joy.

“And this is...?” Wang Sibin asked.

“The fool I mentioned,” Zheng Chaoyang whispered. To Guan Yu: “Friends? Sit.” He stressed “friends,” probing their relation.

Guan Yu seated his harem casually.

“Aren’t you introducing them?” Qin Tian pressed.

“They’re not girlfriends,” Guan Yu said. Before Qin Tian could rejoice, he added, “They’re my wives.”

Zheng Chaoyang choked. “Bullshit! Multiple wives? Dreaming!”

“Hehe, right! I’m just his girlfriend—they’re the wives!” Zhao Jing’er teased, nearly suffocating Zheng Chaoyang. Girlfriend vs. wife—same difference!

“Enough chatter. You’re treating us—let’s order.” Guan Yu dismissed posturing.

Zheng Chaoyang fumed. His plan to humiliate Guan Yu backfired—these beauties gave the bastard an edge.

Wang Sibin interjected smoothly, “Guan Yu, order freely. My treat.”

Guan Yu scribbled expensive dishes. The girls, no strangers to luxury, picked pricier options. Even Liu Shilei’s “simple” choices cost fortunes here.

Wang Sibin probed, “How are these ladies connected to you?”

“Uncle, think Guan Yu unworthy?” Wenqing smirked.

Wang Sibin nodded.

“We’re poor—he ‘keeps’ us for food and clothes!” Zhao Jing’er pouted, doll-like.

“How much do you owe? I’ll repay.”

“Just a hundred million.”

Wang Sibin choked. “A hundred million?! You mock me?”

“I promised Guan Yu a hundred-million-yuan diamond ring to marry him. Still owe it,” she fibbed, relishing his rage.

Qin Tian cut in, “Let me introduce Uncle Wang’s—”

“Here to eat, not gossip,” Guan Yu snapped.

Zheng Chaoyang slammed the table. “You insult my uncle after his hospitality?!”

“You forced me here, threatened consequences if I refused. Now blame me for accepting? How fickle.”

Zheng Chaoyang nearly spat blood. His plan to flaunt connections crumbled.

“All talk, Guan Yu? Dare a real challenge?”

“Like?”

**Chapter 1072: The Wager**

“Drinking contest! If you lose, leave these women and scram!”

Zheng Chaoyang aimed to strip Guan Yu’s “charade.” No woman shares a husband—they’d flock to him once Guan Yu shamed himself.

“Fine. You lose, you pay.”

Zheng Chaoyang sneered. Peasant worries about bills! Even if he lost, a few thousand meant nothing.

“Regardless, the bill’s on me.” He ordered five vodka bottles.

Guan Yu scoffed. “Five? Barely a sip.”

“Brave words! Pure vodka’ll wreck you.”

“We’ll see.”

“Brother, lose and I’ll ignore you!” Zhao Jing’er cheered.

“Lose, and tonight...” Wenqing trailed ominously.

Feng Xin and Mo Ling shot warning looks. Liu Shilei murmured, “Don’t overdo it,” but trusted him.

Their blind faith amused Guan Yu. Did they think him invincible?

Yet, as Zheng Chaoyang poured the first glass, Guan Yu’s smirk never wavered. The real game had just begun.
