“Sit.” Zhang Yi was utterly panicked, speaking in a tone that brooked no defiance. She had to clarify matters before the so-called "outstanding talent" she'd mentioned arrived, lest they become a laughingstock.

Guan Yu felt like a mute swallowing bitter herbs.

Given his earlier glance at inappropriate places, Guan Yu decided to humor Zhang Yi. He sat beside Mo Ling facing Zhang Yi, enduring her murderous gaze.

"Mom," Mo Ling fidgeted, "you two haven't been properly introduced. Let me—"

"No need. We've already... interacted. I understand this person quite well," Zhang Yi said coldly.

"So you're acquainted! Then we can skip formalities," Mo Ling said cheerfully.

_What a wasted acting talent,_ Guan Yu mused. Her performance was flawlessly authentic. Were he in another's shoes, he'd swear these two had consummated their relationship.

But they hadn't. And Zhang Yi's prior impression of him couldn't be worse.

Was this his fault? Who could've known a mother-daughter pair could resemble twins so closely? Now he understood why he'd detected feminine charm from "Mo Ling" earlier—she was fully a mature woman!

"I see no need for further discussion. I oppose this union," Zhang Yi declared.

"Fine. I'll break up with her immediately." Guan Yu stood as if granted amnesty.

Zhang Yi froze, then erupted: "Guan Yu! You think you can walk away after defiling my daughter? This isn't over!"

"I never slept with her." Guan Yu's tone turned grave.

"Didn't you admit rolling in bed together?" Zhang Yi's knuckles whitened. "A real man owns his actions. I'll never entrust Lingling to an irresponsible liar!"

Guan Yu cursed his own stupidity. Why had he mentioned sharing a bed? Now no one would believe he'd remained chaste that night.

"What do you want?" Guan Yu capitulated.

"First, leave my daughter. Second, never speak of your relations. Third, never see her again," Zhang Yi demanded.

"Done. May I leave now?" Guan Yu agreed readily, feeling no guilt toward Mo Ling.

Heartless men deserved contempt.

Zhang Yi's hatred now stemmed from grief over her daughter's stolen virtue. She'd expected Guan Yu to refuse her demands courageously, never anticipating his easy compliance.

How could Mo Ling choose such a man?

Mo Ling seethed at Guan Yu's lack of cooperation. Did he find her so repulsive?

"Want to abandon us? My child needs a father!" Mo Ling declared solemnly.

Guan Yu's organs ached. This girl spoke recklessly!

As Zhang Yi panicked about pregnancy, Mo凌shyly nodded.

"Abort it," Zhang Yi commanded.

"Mother! This is life! I want my son to have grandparents' love!" Mo凌 insisted.

Guan Yu marveled at her acting. Would she demand he actually impregnate her?

Before he could ponder further, his supposed rival arrived.

"Apologies for my tardiness, Aunt Zhang." A sophisticated man entered—Li Chen, the perfect suitor.

As pleasantries ensued, Mo凌sneered: "See my man here? Save your breath."

Li Chen maintained composure: "Congratulations on your union."

"Thank you!" Mo凌beamed.

After Li Chen's departure, Zhang怡confronted Guan宇alone.

"You think silence helps? I'll never permit this! Do you know her pedigree? Her father's vice-ministerial rank? Her uncles' power? My billions? You're unfit!"

"Madam, you misunderstand—"

"Take five million and disappear."

Guan宇pushed back: "You misunderstand everything. We're not truly together—she's deceiving you."

Though stunning, beauty granted no privileges. As their confrontation continued, Guan宇prepared to unravel the charade.
