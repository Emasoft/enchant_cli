With a thud, Guan Yu’s face stiffened. He coughed hastily and said, “Alright, I’ll go cook for Jing’er. You haven’t eaten either, right?”

“Wait, Guan Yu—why do you smell like a woman’s perfume?”

“Nonsense! How could a grown man like me have a woman’s scent?” Guan Yu forced a laugh, sidestepping to leave.

“What’s this?” Du Xiaojuan’s eyes lit up as she plucked a long black hair from his shirt button.

“Jing’er’s!” Guan Yu blurted without hesitation, shifting the blame to Zhao Jing’er.

Zhao Jing’er gazed at him pitifully, nodding in confusion.

True to her simple-minded nature, Du Xiaojuan pouted, nodded, then shifted her attention elsewhere. Following Guan Yu into the kitchen, she leaned against the doorframe, chattering about Feng Xin’s affairs. Meanwhile, Zhao Jing’er stood meekly on the other side of the door, watching Guan Yu bustle about the kitchen with quiet devotion.

These two little shadows, Guan Yu mused with amusement.

After ensuring Zhao Jing’er finished dinner, he began her evening treatment in her bedroom. Casually, he asked, “How was school today? Adjusting well?”

“Mhm… It’s good. Just… I feel uneasy when Brother isn’t around,” she murmured, cheeks flushed.

Guan Yu smiled faintly but remained silent.

“Brother… Does Jing’er being with you like this… make Sister Xiaojuan and Sister Xin unhappy?” she ventured timidly.

Guan Yu shook his head dismissively. “Don’t overthink it. As long as I’m here, no one will bully us. Tell me if anyone troubles you, understand?” He patted her cheek affectionately before withdrawing his left hand from her chest.

“Sleep early. Don’t stay up tinkering with that laptop,” he remarked, eyeing the perpetually open computer on her nightstand.

“Mhm… Goodnight, Brother. Sweet dreams,” she replied softly, her smile warm as honey.

Like a doting parent, Guan Yu tucked her blankets snugly, pinched her pert little nose, and exited her room.

Past nine o’clock, Feng Xin still hadn’t returned. Back in his bedroom, Guan Yu hesitated before dialing her number. Though the tomboy had moved in with him, her late absence gnawed at his concern.

**Chapter 303: Fury Unleashed for an Escort**

Feng Xin, occupied with family business matters, answered briefly before hanging up.

No sooner had Guan Yu ended the call than his phone rang again.

“Yu-ge! Emergency! Come quick!” Luo Cheng’s urgent voice crackled through.

“What’s happened? Calm down,” Guan Yu demanded, pausing at his bedroom door.

“It’s Niu Le! The idiot got drunk and went berserk! Took two underlings to settle some grudge! I can’t handle this—you need to talk sense into him!” Luo Cheng explained frantically.

Guan Yu frowned. “What grudge? He’s been holed up at your bar lately. Did he start trouble?”

“Too complicated to explain. We’re coming to pick you up,” Luo Cheng said wearily before hanging up.

Changing clothes in his bedroom, Guan Yu found Du Xiaojuan soaking her feet by the bed.

“Going out?” she asked quietly.

“Checking on Niu Le. Sleep first,” he replied briskly, dressing to leave.

“Be careful… I’ll wait up for you,” she whispered behind him.

Pausing, Guan Yu offered a faint smile and nod before departing.

Living with Du Xiaojuan blurred their relationship’s definition, yet he’d grown accustomed to her clingy affection. The absolute devotion of her and Zhao Jing’er didn’t burden him—rather, it filled a void left by lifelong solitude. This tender interdependence felt precious.

Soon after leaving the villa, Luo Cheng arrived with henchmen in a Land Rover.

“Yu-ge!” The men bowed respectfully as Guan Yu entered the passenger seat.

“What’s the situation?” Guan Yu demanded as they drove.

Luo Cheng grimaced. “While you were away, Niu Le stayed at the bar. Got cozy with two hostesses—especially one called Yuanyuan. I warned him it’s just playacting, but the fool fell hard. Tonight, when some pimp from West District took Yuanyuan to clients, drunk Niu Le stormed off with buddies to raid the place. Needs your intervention.”

“All this over a working girl?” Guan Yu lit a cigarette calmly.

“Hostesses rarely stay clean—especially materialistic ones needing cash for luxuries,” Luo Cheng shrugged. “They moonlight through pimps.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Where’s Niu Le now? Who’s the pimp?”

“Old Han—a longtime West District operator. Runs clean brothels, well-connected. Called me directly out of respect for our gang. Only you can rein Niu Le in.”

Guan Yu weighed the situation. Though their side was wrong, Old Han’s deference suggested peaceful resolution. “No backup needed. We’ll handle this civilly.”

**Chapter 304: The Old Building’s Secret**

Arriving at West District’s neon-lit backstreets, they navigated past massage parlors and夜市 stalls to a decaying apartment block—its dark stairwell reeking of urine.

“Converted into love nests,” Luo Cheng explained as they climbed past loitering men and women.

On the fourth floor, twenty-odd people crowded the stairs—Old Han’s crew. The scar-faced pimp greeted them wearily.

“Brother Luo! Your boys crossed lines tonight! Scared off my clients!” Old Han complained, eyeing Guan Yu.

“My apologies. Drunken folly,” Luo Cheng placated.

When Luo Cheng deferred to Guan Yu, Old Han started. “The Guan Yu? The rising star?”

After pleasantries, Guan Yu inquired about Niu Le’s whereabouts.

**Chapter 305: Burn It All Down**

Old Han led them to a room where Niu Le raged amidst shattered furniture. Spotting Guan Yu, the drunk froze.

“Yu-ge! They took Yuanyuan! She’s—”

“She’s working,” Guan Yu cut coldly. “You’re shaming our gang. Apologize to Brother Han.”

When Niu Le resisted, Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “Is this worth burning bridges over? Use your head!”

As Niu Le slumped in defeat, Guan Yu turned to Old Han. “Compensation for damages—name your terms.”

Old Han waved magnanimously. “For Guan Yu’s face, water under the bridge!”

The tension dissolved—until sudden gunfire erupted downstairs. A henchman burst in: “Cops! They’re raiding!”

Chaos erupted as Guan Yu shoved Niu Le toward the fire escape. “Move! We’re not getting pinched tonight!”
