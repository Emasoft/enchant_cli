However, everything had now changed. Guan Yu's appearance had completely transformed Feng Xihu, altering the trajectory of her entire life.

After Feng Xihu departed, Guan Yu glanced toward the second floor where a woman stood clad in sky-blue chiffon that revealed tantalizing glimpses of her figure below, paired with adorable black panda-head ballet flats. This was Yang Conghan (Frost Willow) - though typically seen in sportswear that matched her preference for celestial hues, today's unusually cute attire marked a departure from her usual pure and innocent style.

Their eyes met across the distance. Yang Conghan beckoned with a wave, her posture dipping into a slight bow reminiscent of traditional wifely deference as Guan Yu ascended the stairs. "Why this charming transformation today? It becomes you remarkably," Guan Yu inquired, curiosity coloring his tone.

His casual compliment unexpectedly summoned melancholy to Yang Conghan's features. "I thought my natural beauty could capture your heart," she murmured, "yet even doll-like Hanhan outshines me. Since you favor such adorable charm..." Her voice trailed off as she tightened her grip on his hand, leading him into the office.

Yang Conghan's bitter words hung between them - "Among your women, I'm but a complimentary accessory." Guan Yu protested this self-deprecation, insisting on equality in his regard, yet her rebuttal cut sharper: "Equality? The disparity runs deep. At least in your heart."

As their conversation danced around recent events involving the Feng family, Yang Conghan served tea brewed from rare white leaves using chilled water methods. The tart floral notes did little to sweeten her probing questions about Feng Xihu's visit. "Why repeatedly reject such rare beauty when she clearly adores you?" she pressed, her body leaning into his space.

Guan Yu's explanation about inevitable conflict with the Feng clan rang hollow against Yang Conghan's perceptive observations of lingering affection. Their verbal sparring gradually dissolved into physical intimacy, Yang Conghan's calculated coyness giving way to unrestrained passion that echoed through soundproofed walls.

In adjacent offices, accountant Qing Ling'er (Spirit Child) struggled to focus on month-end reports as impassioned cries and rhythmic impacts permeated the partitions. The prim secretary's cheeks flushed crimson as unwitting eavesdropping stretched past the hour mark. By the time Yang Conghan's exhausted whimpers stilled, Qing Ling'er fled downstairs in disarray, offering flustered excuses to concerned manager Hou Jinshun.

Her walk home proved no respite - mental replays of overheard encounters tormented the young woman's imagination. When Pan Taisheng (Great Sage Pan) encountered her agitated state near the apartments, Qing Ling'er's distracted responses did little to assuage his worries.

The night's events left multiple parties unsettled - Yang Conghan's strategic seduction, Guan Yu's conflicted loyalties, and Qing Ling'er's awakened curiosities all simmering beneath A City's moonlit sky. As power dynamics shifted between four great families and Guan Yu's influence grew, personal entanglements threatened to complicate carefully laid political strategies.
