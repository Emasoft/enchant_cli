“Mom!” Wenya cried out in agony, tears instantly blurring her vision as she struggled even more fiercely.

***

“Hmph, hurry up and take her away! After I’ve had my fun today, I’ll let you all have your turn!” Li Zhi urged impatiently.

***

“Yes, boss!” The two underlings’ eyes gleamed as they fought to keep Wenya from breaking free.

***

“Li Zhi, you goddamn bastard!”

***

At that moment, an enraged roar echoed from the hospital room doorway.

***

Bald Qiang charged in with bloodshot eyes, violently kicking Xiaobao to the ground. He then swung a fist at another man, forcing him to release Wenya.

***

“Bald Qiang, you dare ruin my plans?” Li Zhi’s face darkened menacingly.

***

“Ruin your mother’s plans! You’re asking for death by touching Guanyu’s woman!” Bald Qiang spat furiously.

***

He’d returned after receiving a call from the long-missing Guanyu, only to witness Wenya being assaulted. If Guanyu saw this, Bald Qiang knew he’d face dire consequences.

***

Thus, he snapped into action!

**Chapter 831: You Dare Lay Hands on My Woman?**

***

Li Zhi sneered, “Bald Qiang, if I had a penny for every time you spouted that nonsense...”

***

“Guanyu’s woman? Don’t insult my intelligence!” He shot Bald Qiang a contemptuous glare, refusing to believe Wenya was connected to the underworld legend.

***

“Even if this slut were his woman, I’d still defile her today! Cuckolding a legend? Now THAT would be satisfying!” Li Zhi leered obscenely.

***

**CRASH!**

***

A sudden impact sent Li Zhi sprawling across the floor.

***

“Who dares kick me?!” he roared, scrambling up.

***

“So you’re certain you’ll touch my woman?” Guanyu stood at the doorway, smiling faintly—a cold, dangerous smile.

***

**Chapter 832: Husband, It Must Be You!**

***

Tensions escalated as Guanyu’s ruthless efficiency left Li Zhi broken and unconscious. With the threat neutralized, attention turned to the impending university centennial gala.

***

“Husband, you’re the only one who can save this!” Wenqing pleaded, her leadership stretched thin when the co-host fell ill.

***

“Relax, wife. Your hero’s here!” Guanyu grinned, stepping into the spotlight—both literally and metaphorically.

***

**Chapter 833: Where’s Your Dignity?**

***

As chaos threatened the grand event, Guanyu’s adaptability shone. With hours left, he seamlessly assumed the unexpected role of host, proving once more that when principles clash with pragmatism... well, some rules were meant to be bent.

***

The evening unfolded with unexpected twists, proving that even in academia’s hallowed halls, a dash of underworld flair could steal the show.
