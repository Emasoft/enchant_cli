“As for my life’s ambitions, I yearn to achieve them, but the truth is, I don’t want to leave you either.” Du Teng lowered his voice. For a hardened man like him to speak such words aloud was truly arduous.

“Because I’ve been poisoned. During my earlier pursuit of advancement, to rapidly enhance my cultivation, I contracted a Blood Poisoning...”

When Du Teng reached this point, Guan Yu stared in astonishment. Wang Xiaorong likewise widened her eyes. After exchanging glances, Guan Yu pressed, “Brother Du, you say you’ve contracted Blood Poisoning? Which variety? Could you elaborate?”

“This poison is extraordinarily potent. Once infected, there’s no cure. During my reckless pursuit of rapid cultivation progress, I fell victim to deception. This Blood Poisoning lurks within the body as a latent toxin. Every full moon, it erupts, transforming me into a black-furred monstrosity that slaughters without blinking. Only by obtaining antidotes in time can the toxicity be suppressed. Otherwise, I’ll eventually perish from exhaustion of vital essence. Moreover, this poison gradually devours one’s soul essence. Each eruption shortens the victim’s lifespan.”

“I’m now half-monster. You must understand – I’m no longer normal. I can’t be with you, for this would inevitably disrupt your life. Worse still, should my Blood Poisoning erupt without timely antidote...I might kill you myself.”

Guan Yu gazed meaningfully at Wang Xiaorong. He recognized this Blood Poisoning all too well – currently exclusive to the Soul Demon Sect. This meant Du Teng had fallen prey to their machinations.

“Demonic sects remain demonic,” Guan Yu muttered darkly. Noticing his expression, Wang Xiaorong grew anxious. She knew the Blood Poisoning originated from the Blood Lord of Black Blood Ridge. Though now employed by the Soul Demon Sect, its usage remained strictly controlled.

“How could this be coincidence? Why would the Soul Demon Sect target Du Teng?” she wondered aloud. “He’s merely a martial artist. What value could they see in controlling him?”

Fearing Guan Yu’s anger, she hastily asked, “Brother Du, when were you infected?”

Du Teng closed his eyes in recollection. “Two years past. At the time, Zhenxiang and I lived peacefully in a mountain village. I trained diligently as always, aspiring to become a grandmaster someday.”

“After breaking through a long-standing bottleneck, I became intoxicated with ambition. While traveling to town for supplies, I encountered a man collapsed by the roadside – drenched in sweat, clothes torn, a deep gash across his chest. Seeing him near death, I rendered aid.”

“While bandaging him, his enemies pursued us. Uncertain of allegiances, I nevertheless repelled them. The man claimed admiration for my skills and offered a cultivation-enhancing elixir as repayment.”

“Blinded by ambition, I swallowed the proffered pill without hesitation. Only later did I realize the deception.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “The man you saved was himself a Blood Poisoning victim. His wretched state resulted from incomplete beast transformation. That pill contained his tainted blood. Do you recall his name or affiliation?”

Du Teng stared in surprise at her knowledge. “Correct. Initially, I felt no ill effects. Before departing, the man told me to seek him at Black Blood Ridge should complications arise.”

Wang Xiaorong exhaled in visible relief. “Thank heavens it’s Black Blood Ridge.”

Du Teng and Zhenxiang frowned at her reaction. Realizing her misstep, Wang Xiaorong amended hastily, “Don’t misunderstand. The Black Blood Ridge’s Left Envoy is notoriously ruthless – those villains spare none.”

Guan Yu nodded understandingly. This theatrical condemnation aimed to dissociate Du Teng’s plight from the Soul Demon Sect. Indeed, Du Teng’s infection predated their acquisition of the poison by over a year.

Chapter 4129: Final Resolution

Zhenxiang’s sobs subsided as she gazed imploringly at Du Teng. “Ah-Teng, why didn’t you tell me? Whatever trials come, we should face them together!”

Du Teng shook his head bitterly. “During my first beast transformation, though semi-lucid, I left you that farewell note to avoid burdening you. Surely you understand?”

“Now I do. But why endure alone? Perhaps I could’ve helped!”

“No one can help. This poison’s incurable – only monthly antidotes suppress it. Without them...” Du Teng trailed off grimly.

Guan Yu interjected, “Thus knowing yourself doomed, you wandered the martial world, dedicating yourself to cultivation. Your final ambition became challenging the Swordless Immortal, yes?”

“Precisely. The Black Blood Ridge sought to exploit me, but I proved their control illusory. Through meticulous preparation before full moons, I learned to suppress the beast transformation – though unpredictably.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Impossible. Without antidotes, transformation should be inevitable.”

“You understand Blood Poisoning well?” Du Teng challenged.

“Well enough to know it’s incurable.”

“Yet I suppress it.” Du Teng explained, “Refusing to serve those Black Blood Ridge villains, I resolved to drown myself during one full moon rather than risk slaughtering innocents.”

“Yet I survived. Washing ashore two days later, un-transformed. Later experimentation revealed my internal energy could localize the poison to my left leg during transformations.”

Guan Yu brightened. “Marvelous! If controllable–”

“Not so simple.” Du Teng interrupted. “Subsequent full moons required suppressing both legs with dwindling success. Each transformation grows more violent. My energy barely contains it now.”

As Du Teng fell silent, Zhenxiang resumed weeping – heartbroken yet helpless before her beloved’s torment.

Guan Yu calculated aloud, “The next full moon approaches in two days. You sought to challenge the Swordless Immortal as your final act, yes?”

“Correct. Rather than endanger Zhenxiang further, I’d embrace death with purpose. Last night’s storm-swept sword practice reflected my turmoil.”

Chapter 4130: Joyous Tidings

Zhenxiang cried out, “Ah-Teng! What of our child if you die? Our son hasn’t even met his father!”

Du Teng froze mid-stride. Slowly turning, he whispered hoarsely, “We...have a child?”

Nodding through tears, Zhenxiang managed a tremulous smile. “When you left, I collapsed from grief. The physician revealed my two-month pregnancy. Our robust son resembles you greatly. He awaits his father’s name.”

“For eighteen months I searched, never doubting your love. Now understanding your sacrifice...I’d embrace you even as monster. Please return home, if only for a day!”

The revelation stunned all present. Guan Yu stepped forward, grinning. “Congratulations, Brother Du! Will you abandon life now that fatherhood calls?”

As Guan Yu pushed him toward Zhenxiang, Du Teng trembled. “Truly? A son?”

“Our gluttonous little treasure!” Zhenxiang laughed through tears. “The family adores him.”

Du Teng’s fleeting smile faded. “But my condition...”

Guan Yu turned to Wang Xiaorong. “I’ve a request.”

Anticipating him, she sighed. “I’ll secure antidotes – though temporarily.”

“Temporary suffices!” Guan Yu clapped Du Teng’s shoulder. “With means to suppress the poison, will you still court death? Or meet your son?”

“You can truly help?”

“Guaranteed. Before the full moon, you’ll receive what’s needed.” Guan Yu vowed.

Wang Xiaorong calculated inwardly. If messenger birds departed immediately, the Left Envoy might arrive in time. For Guan Yu’s sake, she’d ensure it.
