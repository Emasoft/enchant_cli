“Because when these people were at their lowest, it was Sun Xu who helped them. Like me, they were utterly desperate when Sun Xu lent a hand. I used to be a worthless drunk, causing trouble all day. When I ran out of money, I became a beggar. Later, Sun Xu found me and gave me this job. That’s why I’ve managed to keep living.

Those still willing to work for Sun Xu now are mostly people who received his kindness during their hardest times. This is their way of repaying him.”

“Are these all the men Sun Xu has in the factory?” Guan Yu frowned at the list with fewer than ten names.

“Of course not,” Jing Boyan reminded him. “These are just the ones whose names I could recall immediately. There are others I’m less familiar with who also assist him.”

“Good. With this list, I can easily root them out. The recent thefts should quiet down soon.” Guan Yu nodded in satisfaction.

At the mention of stolen goods, Jing Boyan interjected, “The thefts were part of Sun Xu’s long-standing plan. Initially, they stole small amounts to avoid detection. But after Sun Xu recruited me, their confidence grew—they took more and more.

With my help altering surveillance footage, even if you inspected the monitors, you’d find nothing amiss. Once they bypassed the cameras, smuggling the stolen leather out became effortless.”

“That easily?” Guan Yu leaned forward, intrigued. “How did they move bulk shipments past the guards? Workers leaving after shifts couldn’t possibly carry out large quantities unnoticed.”

Jing Boyan explained, “The guards inspect individuals strictly, but they rarely check outgoing trucks. The thieves wait for shipment days. When trucks load goods in the warehouse, they bribe drivers to hide stolen leather among legitimate cargo or even trash. The drivers are paid to deliver the contraband to designated locations.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed in realization. The guards meticulously searched pedestrians but ignored vehicles—a critical oversight. Trucks entered daily: some carried raw materials, others shipped finished products or hauled waste.

Sun Xu’s men had exploited this laxity. Guan Yu cursed his own negligence. He should have anticipated that large-scale theft required vehicles, not manual smuggling.

“But shipments are monitored by your quality inspectors,” Jing Boyan added. “Their real loophole was the garbage trucks. They prearranged with waste collectors to hide stolen leather among factory scraps. No one suspects discarded ‘trash.’”

“Garbage trucks?” Guan Yu repeated, stunned.

“Exactly.” Jing Boyan nodded. “The factory produces mountains of leather scraps daily. By bribing waste haulers, they smuggled out stolen goods disguised as rubbish.”

Now enlightened, Guan Yu straightened. “From this moment, you’re part of the Yu Gang. Only the three of us—and yourself—know your true allegiance. Guard this secret with your life.”

Present were Guan Yu, Xue Jing, Wang Hu, and Jing Boyan. Though Sun Xu’s influence waned, Guan Yu valued the insider. The weaker Sun Xu became, the more crucial Jing Boyan’s role.

“Thank you for taking me in, Boss.” Jing Boyan bowed deeply.

Guan Yu waved a hand. “How effective are the new surveillance cameras I installed?”

“They’re high-definition—costly, I assume? Each must’ve cost tens of thousands.” Jing Boyan’s expertise showed in his accurate estimate.

“Has Sun Xu issued new orders recently?”

“No. He told us to lay low, claiming he’ll ‘steal bigger later.’ Perhaps he suspects your vigilance.”

“It’s more complicated,” Guan Yu mused. “Stay here and monitor his communications. When he moves, alert me immediately. This time, I’ll crush Bill Lin completely.”

“Understood, Boss.”

Still uneasy, Guan Yu pressed, “Is there no footage of past thefts?”

“None.” Jing Boyan shook his head apologetically. “I disabled cameras during their operations or deleted recordings. The deletions were permanent—irrecoverable.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Keep future evidence intact.” He ordered Wang Hu to renovate the surveillance room, adding a bed and TV for Jing Boyan’s extended stays. A new burner phone ensured secure, single-line contact.

As they departed, Xue Jing voiced doubts. “Can we trust him? What if he’s playing both sides?”

“A shrewd man recognizes opportunity,” Guan Yu said. “Sun Xu offers no future. With us, he soars. Think of a caged bird—it eats offered crumbs not out of love, but to survive until it can fly free. Given wings, it won’t linger.”

Xue Jing grasped the metaphor: Jing Boyan was that bird, biding time for liberation.

“And if he flies too high to control?” she pressed.

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. “Then we clip his wings.”

The next morning, Guan Yu surveyed his vandalized bar. Shattered glass littered the floor as Yu Gang members cleaned. Jia Bo hurried over, offering a bank card. “Six million from Poison Widow, Boss. The nightclub next door got hit worse.”

Guan Yu ignored the card. “Sit. Explain.”

Jia Bo recounted the ambush: twenty thugs with bats, suppressed only by his pistol. A simultaneous attack wrecked the nightclub. Interrogations pinned Poison Widow as the mastermind.

“Any serious injuries?” Guan Yu asked.

“A patron’s hospitalized. His girlfriend demands compensation. A waitress has minor scrapes.”

“Compensate them fully—medical bills plus damages. Our reputation stays intact, even during repairs.”

Guan Yu’s voice chilled. Bill Lin had crossed a line—attacking businesses breached their unspoken truce.

“Summon Wei Hongwei,” he ordered. “Use half the money for reparations and repairs. The rest funds Yu Gang’s treasury.”

Inspecting the ink-stained nightclub, Xue Jing wrinkled her nose. “A full renovation’s needed.”

“Three million suffices,” Guan Yu told Jia Bo. “You and Wei Hongwei oversee this. I have greater plans for you both.”

As they left, Guan Yu’s mind raced. Poison Widow’s use of mundane thugs, not cultivators, puzzled him. But retribution would come—swift and merciless.

The next dawn brought chaos to the Yu Gang’s headquarters. Guan Yu observed the wreckage, resolve hardening. Bill Lin’s games had escalated to war.

And war he would receive.
