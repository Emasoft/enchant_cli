“Chief Xiang, you have the audacity to speak of propriety?” Chief Dai interjected coldly. “When Junior Brother Lu and I arrived, we witnessed you unleashing a lethal-grade spell against a junior disciple! Is this how a Peak Chief maintains dignity? Since when does disciplining require murderous intent?”

“Is this true?” Xuanming’s brows furrowed deeply.

According to sect rules, while Peak Chiefs held authority to discipline juniors, such actions were meant as warnings—not executions. Any fatal measures required deliberation with the offender’s master. If Chief Xiang had indeed attempted to kill Guanyu, this crossed into unforgivable territory.

“Of course it’s true!” Second-to-Wolf snapped. “Do I look like a child spinning tales before elders?”

Xuanming turned to Chief Lu for confirmation. The latter sighed, “When Second-to-Wolf and I arrived, Chief Xiang was channeling a high-level offensive spell through his artifact. The energy output... was unquestionably lethal.”

A heavy silence fell. Chief Xiang’s face darkened as Second-to-Wolf added venomously, “Had Brother Lu not stayed my hand, that blade would’ve taken his head instead of his hair! Ask yourself, Sect Leader—would you stand idle if someone tried to murder your disciple?”

Xuanming stroked his beard, the weight of leadership pressing upon him. “While your protective instincts are commendable, Second-to-Wolf, nearly decapitating a Peak Chief...” His gaze sharpened. “Chief Xiang, explain yourself.”

The disheveled Peak Chief straightened, though his missing locks undermined any dignity. “This junior disrupted our disciples’ training and injured over twenty of my students! As their master, could I remain passive?”

“Lies!” Guanyu stepped forward, the Imperial Seal glowing faintly at his waist. “Your disciples ambushed me first. When Junior Sister Siqi tried shielding me, your spell would have crushed us both had I not activated the Seal’s defenses!”

Murmurs rippled through the hall. Xuanming’s eyes widened. “You used the Imperial Seal’s stored spell? That artifact’s energy was a precious gift from Elder Jiu!”

Guanyu bowed deeply. “Forgive me, Master. But facing a Nascent Soul elder’s full assault, survival demanded desperate measures.”

The Sect Leader whirled on Chief Xiang. “You forced a junior to waste Elder Jiu’s blessing? Have you no shame? Twenty disciples and a Peak Chief against one untrained boy?”

Chief Dai’s laughter rang cold. “How innovative—using human waves to suppress talent. Truly, Left Void Peak’s strategies impress.”

“Enough!” Xuanming’s roar silenced the chamber. “Both parties bear fault. Guanyu for reckless artifact use, Chief Xiang for disproportionate force. After tomorrow’s Six Peaks Tournament, the Discipline Hall shall...”

“Sect Leader!” Xiao Zhi pushed through the crowd, bowing urgently. “I witnessed everything. Chief Xiang didn’t just attack—he used his own disciples as shields against Guanyu’s counterstrikes!”

Gasps erupted. Chief Xiang paled as Xuanming’s qi flared, cracking the stone beneath his feet. “Using disciples as meat shields? You disgrace the title of Peak Chief!”

Under the Sect Leader’s wrathful gaze, Chief Xiang finally crumbled. “I... acted rashly. The junior’s insolence clouded my judgment.”

“Rashness?” Xuanming’s voice dripped frost. “Your ‘rashness’ nearly cost us two promising youths and a divine artifact! Until the tournament concludes, you’re confined to Left Void Peak. As for Guanyu...” His expression softened marginally. “Conserve the Seal’s power. We’ll replenish its energies after the competition.”

As the assembly dispersed, Second-to-Wolf clapped Guanyu’s shoulder. “Next time, I’ll teach you how to dodge without wasting precious artifacts.”

Guanyu watched Chief Xiang’s retreating figure, the man’s severed hair trailing like a banner of defeat. “There shouldn’t be a next time.”

“Naive boy.” Second-to-Wolf’s grin turned feral. “Talent attracts knives like honey draws flies. But don’t worry—” His blade sang from its sheath. “I’ll keep pruning the weeds.”

In the shadows, Chief Dai observed the exchange, her fingers brushing the spiritual fruits at her belt—offerings for a certain wolf who appreciated fine vintage. The game deepened, and Guanyu remained blissfully unaware of the storm gathering beyond tomorrow’s tournament.
