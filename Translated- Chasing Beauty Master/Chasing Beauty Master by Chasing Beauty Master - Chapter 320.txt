“Hmph, let’s see if you feathery bastard dare act arrogantly with me again!” Guan Yu struck a triumphant pose and laughed heartily.

"Did you really hit it? How on earth did you manage that?" Gao Wei gazed distantly at where the giant bird had vanished, murmuring to herself.

Her logical mind couldn’t comprehend how the rapidly flying bird had been struck by Guan Yu’s stone, how it was even possible.

Though she couldn’t believe it, she’d witnessed it with her own eyes, now drowning in shock!

"So? Impressed by my ‘bending the bow to shoot the great eagle’ skills?" Guan Yu sidled up to Gao Wei, smugness dripping from his words.

"Remember our bet? Come on, I’m ready!" He leaned closer, tilting his grinning face toward hers, waiting for her kiss.

"Beast!" The words hissed through Gao Wei’s clenched teeth.

"Hey, not only do you refuse to honor the bet, but you insult me too?" Guan Yu’s expression darkened with feigned indignation.

Gao Wei rolled her eyes. "Even the world’s top marksman with the finest rifle might not have hit that bird from your position. Yet you used a tree branch and stone to wound it. Are these human feats? What else but a beast could do this?"

Guan Yu was speechless. Since when did achieving the impossible make one a beast?

"Enough talk—the bird’s wounded. Time to pay up." He leaned in again, shamelessly offering his cheek.

Gao Wei’s heart raced as she hesitated. Was this nightmare becoming reality? Must she really kiss him?

Her thoughts spiraled wildly, pulse thundering as she leaned closer...

"Ah! Guan Yu—look behind you!" she suddenly cried, recoiling.

Guan Yu smirked, keeping his cheek turned. "Nice try. Kiss first!"

A piercing shriek rent the air. Before he could react, darkness engulfed him as the giant bird’s talons snatched him skyward.

"Guan Yu!" Gao Wei’s screams faded below as the bird carried him into the clouds.

The bird’s claws tightened mockingly. Enraged, Guan Yu activated his Coin’s gravity systems, reversing the stone’s weight to slam into the creature earlier. Now, he’d turn the tables.

As the bird dove toward its nest, Guan Yu feigned death. The creature dropped him into its stinking lair, littered with bones and rotting flesh. Hidden in the shadows lay four chicks—three ordinary, one peculiar gray hatchling radiating unnatural energy.

While the bird prepared to feed its young, Guan Yu struck. His Pet System flared, seizing control of the beast’s mind. But resistance surged—this creature’s intelligence defied easy domination.

The bird shrieked furiously, breaking free and attacking. Wings buffeted Guan Yu against stone walls as razor talons slashed. Desperately, he reactivated healing systems to mend fractures, biding time for another opening.

In the chaos, the gray hatchling chirped weakly. Guan Yu’s scan revealed its unique genetic mutation—a fragile life clinging to existence. Perhaps this aberration held the key to survival.

As the enraged parent lunged again, Guan Yu unleashed his full systems—gravity manipulation slowing the beast while pet control waves hammered its consciousness. With a final psychic surge, dominance snapped into place.

The bird froze, eyes glazing as bonds solidified. Victory flashed through Guan Yu’s grin—this arrogant fowl now served him. But triumph proved fleeting.

With an earsplitting screech, the creature rebelled, shattering mental shackles. Talons snatched Guan Yu airborne once more, hurling him toward jagged rocks below. Healing energy blazed as he twisted midair, gravity systems cushioning the bone-shattering impact.

Coughing blood, Guan Yu staggered upright. The hunt reversed—now predator became prey. He’d burn every feather off this overgrown chicken. But first, survival required strategy.

Feigning death once more, he awaited the bird’s approach. When talons gripped his torso, pet systems struck again—this time overwhelming resistance through sheer force. Neural bonds locked irrevocably.

The bird’s eyes glazed obediently. Victory at last! Yet as Guan宇 climbed its back, triumphant laughter echoed—only to choke as the creature spasmed violently.

Pet System... failing?

The bond shattered. Wings thrashed wildly, hurling Guan宇 against stone. Blood dripped as systems overloaded. Desperation ignited—he’d survive this or die trying.

Grappling the beast’s neck, Guan宇 channeled every system into one final strike. Gravity quintupled mid-punch. Bones crunched as the bird plummeted, impact shaking the earth.

Silence.

Guan宇 staggered from the dust, battered but alive. The beast lay motionless—conquered. Yet no triumph stirred. This creature’s strange intelligence hinted at deeper mysteries here... ones he’d unravel, no matter the cost.
