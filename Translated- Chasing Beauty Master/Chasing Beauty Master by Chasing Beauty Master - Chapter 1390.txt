“These words were naturally spoken for Elder Xiang’s benefit, as the real matter lay ahead. In truth, Elder Xiang of Zuo Kong Peak was deeply concerned about dispatching so many disciples. He knew full well that his disciples’ cultivation levels were generally not high, and the mission to search for Miao City in the desert was perilous and arduous.

Yet he could not retreat, lest he become a laughingstock in Guan Yu’s eyes. Even if it meant deaths, he had to persevere.

Elder Xiang hastily interjected, “I find Senior Brother Lu’s reasoning sound. The desert is no place for us—its dangers are well-known. If low-level disciples encounter peril there, death is certain. It would be wiser to send higher-level disciples who can at least ensure their survival.”

Xuan Ming nodded. “Both of you make valid points. Sending stronger disciples not only safeguards their lives but ensures they can hold their own against demonic sect members. This approach merits consideration.”

“Then whom do you propose we send?” Xuan Ming countered, his gaze lingering on Elder Xiang as his eyes flickered with unspoken thoughts.

Elder Lu suggested, “The four finalists from our recent Liu Feng Tournament—the elite of Cloud Azure Sect’s new generation—are ideal. Entrusting them with this mission would guarantee success.”

As he spoke, he observed Elder Xiang’s strained expression, noting his visible reluctance to mention Guan Yu’s name.

“Junior Brother Xiang, what say you?” Elder Lu pressed. “The desert’s dangers are no secret. No disciple would willingly risk their life for this task. Persuading others would prove difficult.”

Elder Xiang reconsidered. *Indeed, Senior Brother Lu is right. If Guan Yu perishes in the desert, all the better.* Aloud, he replied, “I concur. But Zheng Shouzhu’s son, Xiao Zhi, would surely refuse. Elder Zheng would never permit his son to undertake such peril. Likewise, Elder Dai of Juhe Peak would never allow her disciple Siqi to go.”

Xuan Ming acknowledged, “True. Another complication is Guan Yu, currently confined to the back mountains for gravely violating sect rules by attacking you. I’ve no intention of releasing him soon.”

“That leaves only A’Ze,” Elder Lu said. “But even if Elder Zheng agrees, one disciple alone cannot accomplish this. A solitary figure is too vulnerable.”

As Elder Xiang contemplated recommending Guan Yu, Elder Lu added, “Speaking of which—since Guan Yu remains under punishment, why not send him to redeem himself? The desert’s dangers leave him no choice but to comply.”

“An apt suggestion,” Xuan Ming agreed. “Guan Yu possesses both cunning and courage, wields advanced magical artifacts, and practices dual cultivation of magic and martial arts. He is well-suited for this.”

Elder Xiang secretly relished the prospect of Guan Yu meeting his end in the wasteland. “Assigning Guan Yu is prudent, especially as others refuse.”

“Very well,” Xuan Ming decided. “Though guilty, Guan Yu shall atone through this mission. He cannot refuse.”

Thus, through Elder Lu and Xuan Ming’s orchestrated dialogue, Guan Yu was maneuvered into the deadly assignment—whether through benevolence or malice mattered little. The desert’s vast expanse would test his survival.

*Let’s see how long you last out there,* Elder Xiang mused darkly, envisioning Guan Yu’s suffering and demise with grim satisfaction.

“We must still inform Siqi and Xiao Zhi,” Xuan Ming reminded. “Their participation depends on Elders Dai and Zheng’s stance.”

Elder Xiang proposed, “As Senior Brother Lu noted, quality outweighs numbers. Tracking demonic sect members requires stealth—a single agent like Guan Yu would excel. He has... unique methods for such tasks.”

His recommendation for solitude masked lethal intent—fewer companions meant greater peril. Xuan Ming recognized the ploy but acquiesced, resolving to gauge Siqi and Xiao Zhi’s willingness before deciding.

Elder Lu discerned Elder Xiang’s hope for Guan Yu’s demise. Xuan Ming finalized: “Guan Yu goes. Others may volunteer. If Siqi and Xiao Zhi decline, we proceed as Elder Xiang advises.”

Relieved, Elder Xiang knew his mediocre disciples would only fail spectacularly, inviting sect-wide ridicule. This dangerous mission served dual purposes—either Guan Yu perished, avenging his humiliation, or succeeded, proving his worth.

“Master,” Elder Xiang cautioned, “Guan Yu grows arrogant. You must curb him before his wings strengthen. Left unchecked, he’ll become unmanageable.”

“I’m aware,” Xuan Ming replied. “But breaking this wild stallion requires patience. Restraint comes gradually.”

Privately, Xuan Ming acknowledged the need to control Guan Yu without alienating him. The dual-cultivation prodigy was too valuable to lose, yet too dangerous untethered. For now, Cloud Azure Sect’s patronage bound him—but how long before outgrowing their shade?

As Elder Lu departed to relay orders, Xuan Ming confronted Elder Xiang’s feigned convalescence: “Enough pretense, Junior Brother. Your injuries healed days ago.”

Caught, Elder Xiang chuckled awkwardly. “You see through everything, Senior Brother. I merely sought extended rest.”

“Elder Lu also noticed. He tactfully excused himself.” Xuan Ming’s tone turned grave. “Understand this—Guan Yu’s dual cultivation makes him indispensable against the Demon Soul Sect. We endure his insolence to secure our sect’s future. Should he defect to the Demon Lord, disaster follows.”

Elder Xiang conceded, though puzzled: “Why hasn’t the Demon Lord eliminated this threat?”

“Guan Yu’s artifacts and guardians make assassination difficult,” Xuan Ming explained. “Even I might fail to kill him. Moreover...” He left unspoken the true deterrent—the Demon Lord’s daughter Wang Xiaorong, whose obsession with Guan Yu stayed her father’s hand.

Unknown to them, the Demon Lord’s restraint stemmed not from inability but paternal dilemma—destroying Guan Yu risked losing his child. Thus, the precarious balance held... for now.

“I comprehend your reasoning,” Elder Xiang said. “Yet I cannot fathom why Elder Jiu expended such effort shielding Guan Yu. What merits such favor?”

Xuan Ming sighed. “Elder Jiu sees what we cannot. Guan Yu embodies our sect’s destiny. Tread carefully, Junior Brother—this game has higher stakes than pride.”

As they debated, Guan Yu remained oblivious to the machinations encircling him—a pawn in schemes spanning righteousness and ambition, love and death, where the desert’s sands might yet bury more than ancient cities.
