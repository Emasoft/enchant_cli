The mother and daughter hugged each other in tearful excitement, weeping as tragically as if Uncle Qing had already passed away. The other women present also became infected by this sorrowful atmosphere. Fortunately, Mei was busy preparing lunch in the kitchen at that moment – had she been present, her ceaseless crying would likely have resumed.

"Wuwuwu, wawawa..." To everyone's astonishment, Zhang Han (Dancing Willow) began wailing loudly while still chewing on her snacks, startling Guan Yu (Passing Jade).

This marked the first time anyone had witnessed Zhang Han cry during their long acquaintance. Their immediate thought was: What could possibly reduce this eternal child to tears? Zhang Han – crying?

Normally resembling an impish youth who'd never grown up, Zhang Han had always been coddled by the group. Her mischievous antics had never before been accompanied by tears – not even in Yang Conghan's memory. What had provoked this sudden outburst?

"Aiyo, there there, Hanhan. What's wrong? Tell your Sister Jing." Xue Jing (Pure Silence) hurried forward to embrace Zhang Han, patting her back soothingly.

"What's happened to her?"

"Has Hanhan fallen ill?"

The women clustered around, baffled by this unprecedented display. Grape remnants still clung to Zhang Han's gaping mouth as she continued wailing uncontrollably.

Guan Yu's heart ached to comfort her, but his still-healing internal organs restricted movement. Even the slightest exertion risked permanent damage, forcing him to remain prone.

"Hanhan, stop crying now. Tell Big Brother what's wrong," he coaxed helplessly.

Ignoring them all, Zhang Han shuffled toward Guan Yu with snacks tumbling from her mouth. Collapsing against his chest between sobs, she choked out: "I miss my mommy too! Wuwuwu, wawawa!" before dissolving into fresh wails.

This unexpected declaration stunned Guan Yu. Zhang Han's mother was the Demon Clan's princess – how could he possibly locate her? His sidelong glance at Yang Conghan (Enduring Cold) revealed her equally troubled expression.

Having never known maternal affection or even the concept of "mother," Zhang Han's encounter with Aunt Qing and Ling'er (Spirit Child) had sparked existential confusion. Where was her own mother? How had she come into being? These unanswerable questions had breached her emotional dam.

Chapter 2257: Choosing Death

Xue Jing intervened decisively: "There there! Once Big Brother recovers, he'll take you to see your mother. Isn't that right?" Her practiced hands smoothed Zhang Han's hair – deception being the only viable pacification method for now.

"R-really?" Zhang Han sniffled.

"Of course! When have I ever lied? Be good now." Xue Jing's unwavering delivery impressed Guan Yu, though he despaired internally – how could he possibly fulfill this impossible promise?

When Zhang Han turned questioning eyes to him, Xue Jing urgently nodded behind her back. "Y-yes, I'll take you," Guan Yu reluctantly agreed, heart aching at the deception.

Immediately mollified, Zhang Han's sobs subsided to hiccups. "No lies! Hanhan will be good!" She buried her face in Guan Yu's chest, inadvertently halting Aunt Qing and Ling'er's earlier crying spell.

"Lü Mei (Green Plum), Conghan – take Hanhan to the arcade. Buy her snacks," Guan Yu instructed, needing space from this emotional maelstrom. After arranging security escorts, he addressed Aunt Qing apologetically: "My deepest regrets for this disruption."

"That child's a perfect cherub! Why haven't you taken her to her mother?" Aunt Qing inquired.

Guan Yu fabricated quickly: "Her mother... passed away. We've no choice but this pretense." Revealing the demonic heritage remained unthinkable.

Xue Jing redirected tactfully: "Auntie, while your intentions are noble, have you considered Ling'er's wishes? Forcing guardianship upon Guan Yu without consultation does her disservice."

"You're right," Aunt Qing conceded tearfully. "But if my husband goes, I'll follow. Only knowing Ling'er's secure would grant me peace."

"Then I'll die too!" Ling'er interjected dramatically, sparking maternal reproach: "Nonsense! Youth must cherish life!"

The discussion turned to Ling'er's future. Guan Yu tactfully proposed: "This estate remains Ling'er's home always – as sister or otherwise. Let her choose freely."

Chapter 2258: Counselors Converge

Xue Jing noted Guan Yu's diplomatic phrasing stemmed more from filial duty than romantic interest. Ling'er herself stood torn between admiration for Guan Yu and unspoken reservations.

Aunt Qing pressed: "Your father's dying wish was this union! Guan Yu's regard is an immeasurable blessing – why hesitate?"

Guan Yu interjected: "As Ling'er's sworn brother, I'll protect her regardless. No coercion necessary."

When Aunt Qing attempted to kowtow in gratitude, Xue Jing intercepted with cultivator-speed reflexes. "Please! Guan Yu risks reinjury to prevent this."

Simultaneously, Ling'er prostrated herself, forehead reddening against carpet fibers. "I'm unworthy to be your woman," she declared stoically. "Let me remain your sister while resigning to care for Father."

"Resignation's unnecessary!" Xue Jing countered. "Take paid leave instead – keep your position."

Guan Yu endorsed eagerly: "Exactly! Yang Conghan's payroll continues regardless."

Aunt Qing objected: "But abandoning responsibilities—"

"Mother!" Ling'er implored. "Your health can't withstand solo caregiving!"

Chapter 2259: Unconventional Noon

The stalemate continued until Xue Jing proposed compromise: "Ling'er assists temporarily, returning when circumstances permit. The estate remains her sanctuary regardless."

Guan Yu affirmed: "My doors never close to family."

As midday aromas wafted from the kitchen, the emotional tempest gradually subsided – for now. Mei's culinary efforts provided temporary respite, though unresolved tensions simmered beneath the surface of clinking cutlery and forced cheer. The path ahead remained fraught with unspoken truths and impossible promises, each participant navigating their tangled web of duty, affection, and survival.
