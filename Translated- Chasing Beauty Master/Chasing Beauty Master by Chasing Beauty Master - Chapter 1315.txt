“Younger Brother Qi, please rise and speak. Xiaotong remains unconscious, her injuries evidently severe. Our priority now is to examine her condition,” Elder Lu suggested, his tone measured. He found Qi’s claims dubious—Guanyu was nothing like the deceitful portrait painted, especially with Ji Cizhilyuáng by his side.

“Indeed,” Xuanming nodded. “Junior Sister Dai, perhaps you should take Xiaotong away for treatment.”

Elder Dai rose, bowed to Xuanming, and departed with Xiaotong. Once they had left, Senior Brother Qi spoke again: “Master, there is another matter I must report.”

“Speak freely.”

“During Guanyu’s clash with the Blood Lord, he deliberately held back. Despite possessing the Emperor’s Seal gifted by Grandmaster Jiu, he refused to use it. Even that drunken fool beside him was wounded by the Blood Lord. Had I not intervened and slain the Blood Lord, they would all have perished. This proves Guanyu’s alliance with the demonic cult enchantress Wang Xiaorong—his rescue attempt was a hollow act, devoid of sincerity.”

Senior Brother Qi’s accusations, though escalating in severity, lacked credibility. His aim was clear: to inflate his own merits and secure greater rewards. Unbeknownst to him, Xuanming and the others had already seen through his lies.

Xuanming remained silent, head bowed, but Elder Lu could no longer contain himself. He stood abruptly. “Younger Brother Qi, are you claiming that Guanyu and Ji Cizhilyuáng—working together—failed to defeat the Blood Lord and were instead injured by him?”

Mistaking this for belief in his tale, Qi eagerly replied, “Yes, Elder Lu! Every word is true!”

“Nonsense!” Elder Lu roared. “These are baseless lies! Have you learned nothing but deceit during your travels? Do you think us senile fools to be manipulated at will? Let me remind you—the Cloud Azure Sect will never tolerate your scheming!”

Stunned by the outburst, Qi dropped to his knees. “Elder Lu, I swear by my words! Master, surely you believe me?”

Xuanming shook his head in silent disappointment. The truth would await further investigation.

“Lies!” Elder Lu thundered. “You cling to falsehoods even now. Today, you’ve humiliated yourself—blame no one but your own tongue!” The others finally grasped the extent of Qi’s fabrications.

“Elder Lu, if you doubt me, ask Xiaotong herself once she awakens!” Qi pleaded, regret gnawing at him. Xuanming’s stony silence unnerved him further.

“Answer this,” Elder Lu demanded. “Do you know the cultivation levels of Ji Cizhilyuáng, Guanyu, or Siqi?”

Qi faltered, unable to pinpoint where his story had unraveled...

**Chapter 3394: An Unexpected Windfall**

...They had received the Cloud Azure Sect’s summons, ordering their immediate return.

By morning, the group gathered in Guanyu’s chamber. His injuries, healed rapidly through his own resilience, now allowed him to sit upright.

“Senior Brother Qi must have returned to the sect with Xiaotong,” Aze muttered gloomily. His hopes of fishing at Xiao Zhi’s uncle’s estate had vanished.

Guanyu’s thoughts lingered on Xiaotong, guilt shadowing his heart...

**Chapter 3395: The Poison’s Wrath**

Xuanming doted on Qi deeply. Even if Qi never ascended to leadership, replacing an aging elder seemed inevitable.

“Rewards matter little,” Qi said loftily. “I serve the sect.”

Ling Su smirked. “Ah, such humility! Rumors praise your valor—how you battled the Blood Lord and saved Xiaotong.”

Qi straightened his posture proudly. “Duty compels me. Would any disciple abandon a junior sister?”

“True,” Ling Su fawned. “But lesser men lack your prowess. I’d be mere cannon fodder.”

“Modesty ill suits you, Junior Brother. Among our generation, you rank within the top five.”

Their mutual flattery soured as Ling Su recalled the Six Peaks Tournament—and his hatred for Guanyu.

“Why hasn’t that bastard Guanyu returned? His injuries aren’t fatal, I hope?” Ling Su spat venomously.

Qi seized the opportunity. “Guanyu nearly doomed the mission! Without my intervention, they’d all be dead. The sect recalls him—though his wounds may delay him.”

“How fortunate he survives,” Ling Su sneered. “May he perish en route.”

Qi’s eyes gleamed. *Yes! If Guanyu never returns...*

**Chapter 3396: A Terrified Duo**

In the woods, Left Void Peak disciples A-Cai and Wenming—technically imprisoned but secretly freed—roasted game.

A-Cai, his wrist still broken by Guanyu, gnawed meat one-handed. “Heard Qi returned after rescuing Xiaotong. Guanyu’s crew got crushed by demons.”

Wenming chuckled. “Serves him right! Thinks he’s invincible...”

A roar interrupted them. A hulking black beast lunged from the shadows, swatting A-Cai aside. Wenming fled, abandoning his comrade.

The creature—Qi, transformed by poison—sank fangs into A-Cai’s throat, draining his blood before tearing the corpse apart.

Wenming sprinted to Left Void Peak, shrieking, “Master! Disaster strikes!”

Elder Xiang emerged, irritation fading to dread as Wenming collapsed, babbling of monsters.

The woods fell silent, save for the echo of Qi’s bestial howls.
