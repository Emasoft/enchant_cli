“You still want to hit me? Save your breath. Watch your filthy mouth, or I’ll slap you every time I see you!” Wen Qing coldly threatened, using her toe to tilt Fu Lili’s chin upward.

The classroom fell deathly silent. Even Guan Yu, Niu Le, and the others stared in stunned disbelief.

“Husband…I couldn’t help hitting her. Is that okay?” Wen Qing circled around the desks and returned to Guan Yu’s side, asking timidly while anxiously studying his expression.

“Uh…it’s fine. What’s done is done!” Guan Yu shrugged, forcing a smile as he sat down.

Such skill… Her movements were so fluid and agile. Even after sitting, Guan Yu kept replaying Wen Qing’s graceful actions in his mind.

After lingering by Guan Yu’s side until nearly the end of study period, Wen Qing reluctantly left.

“Boss…this sister-in-law is terrifying! She’s a force of nature!” Niu Le dashed over like the wind, awe plastered across his face.

Guan Yu blinked blankly. “She’s…the one we met at the bar that night after returning from Yunnan…”

Niu Le nodded in realization. “No wonder she looked familiar! Brother, your luck is insane…”

Guan Yu chuckled and shook his head.

The beaten Fu Lili sat seething at her desk, surrounded by friends who didn’t know how to comfort her.

“Lili, let’s…go back. Don’t be angry.” The fox-like Xue Yan gently tugged Fu Lili’s sleeve, her large dark eyes pleading.

“Don’t touch me! This isn’t your business!” Fu Lili violently shook off the hand, snarling.

Xue Yan flinched, shrinking back with tearful eyes. “Okay…let’s just return to the dorm?”

“Don’t speak to me!” Fu Lili shouted hoarsely, slamming the desk as she stood. After glaring hatefully at Guan Yu, she stormed out.

Watching her leave, Niu Le grimaced at Guan Yu. “Brother, that shrew won’t let this go. We still haven’t settled last time’s business…”

Guan Yu licked his lips thoughtfully. He’d never taken such spoiled girls seriously before. But after the lesson from Jin Cheng’s incident, he’d learned to look beyond surface appearances.

Analyzing Fu Lili—ordinary spoiled children didn’t develop such extreme arrogance and superiority. Her clothing suggested an influential family. This could get complicated.

If targeting him alone, Guan Yu wouldn’t care. But since Wen Qing did the hitting…if Fu Lili brought gangsters to harass her at night when he wasn’t around… The thought unsettled him.

He hoped he was overthinking. Yet despite self-reassurance, an ominous premonition lingered.

**Chapter 318: Saving Face**

As predicted, during final study period, students from another department burst into the classroom.

“Big Bro! Trouble!” The panting student glanced warily at Guan Yu while addressing Wang Zhen.

“What? Dogs chasing you? Spit it out!” Wang Zhen lounged arrogantly with crossed arms.

The messenger gulped. “Four black cars outside! Ten gangsters—some triad girls too! All brought by your classmate!”

Wang Zhen blinked, turning to Guan Yu. “Looking for a fight? Are they suicidal?” After witnessing Guan Yu’s power against Jin Cheng, he felt invincible.

“But…they went after Campus Belle Wen!”

“What?!” Guan Yu shot up, eyes narrowing.

“They took her to the maple grove! Our brothers are watching, but…” Before he finished, Guan Yu sprinted out.

Niu Le yanked a worn satchel from his desk, chasing after gleefully—finally another fight!

Wang Zhen’s crew followed swiftly.

...

At the maple grove, Wen Qing stood coldly facing black-clad men, Fu Lili, and colorful-haired gangster girls.

“This the one? Not bad!” A lackey leered at Wen Qing. “Could you really hit her, Super Brother?”

The leader Zhang Chao smirked, eyeing Wen Qing. “Feisty one… This bitch hit you, sis?”

“Yes! This slutty campus belle threatened to slap me daily! Where’s your courage now?!” Fu Lili sneered.

Wen Qing tilted her head calmly. “You called me here to watch me slap her? Fine—watch closely.” She stepped forward with lethal grace.

A bespectacled youth burst from the crowd. “Wen Qing! Don’t!” Xu Wei grabbed her arm anxiously.

She shook him off. “Don’t touch me.”

“Let me handle this!” Xu Wei adjusted his glasses, nodding at Zhang Chao. “Super Brother, this is my girlfriend. A misunderstanding!”

Wen Qing’s face darkened. “Liar! I broke up with you!”

Xu Wei grimaced. “Our fight later! Just—”

“Who’s your girlfriend? I have a new boyfriend now!”

Zhang Chao chuckled. “Feisty enough to scold Young Master Xu? Impressive.”

Xu Wei persisted. “Please, give me face. Let’s resolve this peacefully.”

“Save it!” Fu Lili shoved forward. “I’ll slap her tenfold now!”

Zhang Chao waved Xu Wei aside. “Nobody humiliates my sister. Move!”

**Chapter 319: The Devastating Punch**

As tension peaked, Guan Yu’s voice cut through: “Who dares touch my woman?!”

Pushing through the crowd, he stood beside Wen Qing.

“Husband…” She glowed with mixed joy and worry.

Guan Yu eyed Zhang Chao. “Try laying hands on her.”

The gang leader snorted. “You school brats think you’re tough? I’ll break your legs!”

“Sis, hit her!” Zhang Chao ordered.

Fu Lili marched forward, feigning confidence. She shoved Wen Qing. “Slut! Still cocky?!”

Guan Yu tensed to intervene, but Wen Qing blocked him.

“What did you call me?” Her voice dripped ice.

“SLUT!”

In a blur, Wen Qing dropped into stance and delivered a brutal uppercut to Fu Lili’s crotch.

The sickening thud echoed. Fu Lili collapsed shrieking, clutching herself as snot and tears flowed.

Everyone gaped. Even Guan Yu shuddered—that punch replicated male “nutshot” agony.

Zhang Chao’s jaw dropped. “You’re DEAD!”

Four gangster girls charged. Wen Qing dispatched them with kicks, elbows, and a sweeping leg—all crumpled within seconds.

“Nice.” Guan Yu ruffled her hair approvingly.

**Chapter 320: Bloodshed Beckons**

“KILL THAT BITCH!” Zhang Chao roared.

His men surged forward as Guan Yu’s crew formed battle lines. The maple grove erupted into chaos.
