“Oh, really? Who’s this ignorant fool who doesn’t know the height of the heavens or the depth of the earth?” one of the police officers remarked.

Guan Yu didn’t spare these people a single glance, nor did he care how Li Yuan might defend himself. Without another word, he lunged forward and slapped Li Yuan across the face. The force of the blow sent Li Yuan spinning in place, one hand clutching his cheek as he feigned a pitiful expression.

“Officers, you saw that, right? Shouldn’t such a violent thug be arrested and thrown in jail to eat stale buns?” Li Yuan whined to the police like a model citizen.

At that moment, another officer emerged from the internet café—a beautiful female officer named Huang Shan, a friend of Xue Jing.

“Guan Yu?” Huang Shan looked surprised to see him there.

“Oh, this café belongs to my friend. I strongly suspect the twenty-odd troublemakers from this morning were sent by him,” Guan Yu declared, pointing at Li Yuan.

Li Yuan’s heart sank. This pretty officer actually knew Guan Yu? So his earlier beating had been for nothing…

**Chapter Two Thousand and Twenty-Nine: Empty Words Without Proof**

“Guan Yu, accusations require evidence. Without proof, we can’t act on mere speculation,” Huang Shan said to Guan Yu before turning to Qian Yunqing. “We’ve finished our preliminary investigation. No concrete evidence was found at the scene. We’ll notify you of any new developments, and please inform us if you uncover anything.”

Qian Yunqing nodded grimly, glaring at Li Yuan. After Guan Yu’s words, he too was convinced of Li Yuan’s guilt—but proof remained elusive.

Li Yuan inwardly sighed in relief. Thankfully, this female officer followed protocol strictly. Otherwise, he’d be done for today.

“Exactly! Stop slandering me! Where’s your evidence?” Li Yuan suddenly regained his courage, puffing his chest out defiantly.

Guan Yu had long resolved to eliminate scum like Li Yuan, but the timing wasn’t right yet. “Don’t worry—I’ll find the evidence. And you’d better curb your arrogance before it gets you killed.” A flash of murderous intent in Guan Yu’s eyes instantly deflated Li Yuan’s bravado.

Deep down, Li Yuan feared Guan Yu. He knew a mere flick of Guan Yu’s finger could end him. However, after recently gaining Ma Hai as a backer, his confidence had grown enough to provoke Qian Yunqing. He hadn’t expected Guan Yu’s presence but felt safe with the police around.

The morning’s café attack had indeed been Li Yuan’s doing. Their plan was to target those close to Guan Yu—starting with Qian Yunqing.

“That’s a threat! I could sue you right now!” Li Yuan blustered nervously.

“Sue me? Go ahead. Unless they sentence me to death, you’ll die before I do.” Guan Yu’s authoritative tone crushed Li Yuan’s resolve. Knowing he’d gained nothing today and fearing Guan Yu’s retaliation, Li Yuan decided to retreat.

“I’m feeling generous today. I’ll let this slide for now.” Li Yuan turned to leave, forcing false bravado into his steps.

“Wait.” Huang Shan’s voice froze him mid-step. Was she going to arrest him?

“Officer, anything else?” Li Yuan asked, pausing.

Without glancing at him, Huang Shan ordered, “Given your high suspicion level, please accompany us to the station for questioning. Cooperate.”

“Of course! I’m a law-abiding citizen. I’ll fully cooperate!” Li Yuan cursed himself for coming here. One misstep could expose everything.

Though once infamous alongside Sun Zhi as one of Kaihuang’s two delinquent heirs, Li Yuan had always been cowardly. At school, he only bullied the weak, relying on cunning to avoid consequences.

“Good. Officer Liu, take him for questioning. If anything seems off, detain him for twenty-four hours,” Huang Shan instructed.

After Li Yuan was led away, Huang Shan told Guan Yu, “I’ll get to the bottom of this and inform you immediately.”

Guan Yu nodded in thanks, though he doubted the police’s efficiency. By the time they found the culprit, it might take ages. To him, Li Yuan was clearly guilty—he’d settle this personally later.

The silver lining was that the Qian family’s café had insurance covering ninety percent of damages. The only downside was needing renovations before reopening.

Wei Hongwei sidled up to Guan Yu. “Brother Guan, I planned to take Yaoyao home tonight—my dad wants to meet her. But after all this… should I still bring it up?”

“Why ask me? Just ask Yaoyao herself. If she agrees, great. If not, drop it. Simple,” Guan Yu replied.

Romantic matters baffled Guan Yu. Though surrounded by women, none had been his own pursuit—they’d all chased him.

Wei Hongwei realized his parents had already prepared dinner. It’d be rude not to ask. He crept toward Qian Yaoyao like a thief. “Yaoyao… would you come to my place tonight? My dad wants to meet you, but it’s okay if you’re not up for it after today…”

Qian Yaoyao gazed tenderly at him. She knew she’d often been harsh, yet he’d never complained. As his girlfriend, meeting his parents was natural. She smiled softly. “Of course. If your father wants to see me, I’ll go. An ugly daughter-in-law must face her in-laws eventually.”

Wei Hongwei’s worries vanished at her immediate agreement. He leapt for joy—following Guan Yu’s advice always worked. Without it, he’d never have dared ask.

“The café’s minor. Hongwei, treat Yaoyao well, or I’ll make you pay,” Qian Yunqing said cheerfully.

“Don’t worry, Yunqing. Our Hongwei’s lucky if Yaoyao doesn’t bully him,” Guan Yu quipped.

Qian Yaoyao feigned offense. “Lü Mei, your man’s talking nonsense! Like I’d bully this blockhead! Educate him properly!”

Lü Mei muttered, “I don’t have your talents, Yaoyao.”

“Traitor! Taking men’s sides already? How can we stay friends?” Qian Yaoyao lunged playfully for Lü Mei’s chest.

“Yaoyao, stop! I’m not siding with them! Honestly, who could control our Guan Yu?” Lü Mei dodged while laughing.

“I don’t care! Let me grab you, or I won’t stop!” The others watched the hilarious scuffle. Guan Yu noted Wu Chumei—Qian Yunqing’s loyal follower. Beautiful yet fiery-tempered, she was said to surpass even Xue Jing’s explosiveness.

Yet before Qian Yunqing, she transformed into an obedient kitten. Her current smiling demeanor gave no hint of her notorious temper.

**Chapter Two Thousand and Thirty: Stop Pretending to Be Young**

“I don’t care! Let me grab you, or I won’t stop!” The commotion continued as Guan Yu recalled Wu Chumei’s reputation. Her docile act around Qian Yunqing contrasted sharply with her rumored nature.

Guan Yu’s phone rang—Wang Jun was calling. What did this young master want?

“Need something?” Guan Yu answered.

“Guan Yu, I need a favor. Are you free?”

“I’ve time. What’s it about?”

“Let’s meet. I’m at the KFC across from campus.”

Seeing no harm, Guan Yu dropped Lü Mei home first, then drove to the fast-food joint. Upstairs, he found Wang Jun. “Your sister’s not here, is she? I’d rather avoid her,” Guan Yu said, sitting down.

“She’s been busy lately. Haven’t seen her in days.”

“What’s this about?” Guan Yu cut to the chase.

Wang Jun straightened. “You know my… past preferences. My family found out and nagged me to see a shrink. I need you to pose as my boyfriend during a family dinner to convince them I’ve changed.”

Wang Jun stared expectantly. To Guan Yu, this seemed simple—just acting for one meal.

“That’s all? Why me?”

“Yes. Who else? All my friends are women. You’re my only option.” Hearing his earnest tone, Guan Yu agreed. Though Wang Jun was gay, he’d always been straightforward.

“Fine. I’ll pretend once. But keep this quiet.”

“Thanks! You’re the best!” Wang Jun beamed.

Was today “meet-the-parents” day? Wei Hongwei with Qian Yaoyao, now Wang Jun’s charade. Coincidence? Guan Yu later bought a luxury scarf for Wang Jun’s mother.

Driving to Qingshan Avenue’s upscale neighborhood, they stopped at a villa. The spacious yard surrounded a three-story house.

“Your family’s loaded,” Guan Yu remarked.

“Surface glitter. Dad’s overseas business is failing,” Wang Jun sighed.

Wang Jun’s lotus-hued dress highlighted her flawless skin. Amidst greenery, she resembled a radiant bloom.

Businesses rise and fall daily. Walking like a couple toward the villa, they entered an European-style living room. A statuesque woman stood by leather sofas. Her elegant charm captivated Guan Yu.

Unfazed by his gaze—used to male attention—she approached. “Young man, are you Jun’s boyfriend?”

Regaining composure, Guan Yu smiled. “Yes. You must be Wang Jun’s sister?”

Her eyes sparkled as she giggled. “Sharp eyes! Correct—I’m her sister.”

Guan Yu wondered—how many sisters did Wang Jun have? Was this another gay friend?

“Ms. Shen, quit pretending! You’re decades old—stop eyeing fresh meat!” Wang Jun dragged Guan Yu away.

Guan Yu had already guessed—this woman was Wang Jun’s mother. Despite her youthful appearance, she was thirty-seven, having had Wang Jun at eighteen. Meticulous保养 and a vibrant spirit preserved her looks.

Thrilled by Guan Yu’s compliment, she’d played along until her daughter ruined the act. “Ungrateful girl! No sense of humor!”

Wang Jun sighed. Between her eccentric sister and this drama-queen mother, normalcy was impossible.

“Auntie, you genuinely look like her sister. The mistake’s understandable,” Guan Yu flattered.

“I adore such ‘mistakes’!” Preening, she appraised him. “Not bad. What’s your name?”

“Guan Yu. Must you be so rude to guests?” Wang Jun snapped.

“I’m always like this! Xiao Yu, make yourself at home.” She sat beside him.

**Chapter Two Thousand and Thirty-One: For Your Own Good**

Wang Jun rolled her eyes. “Mom, you’ll scare him off. Act your age!”

Ignoring her, the mother chirped, “Xiao Yu’s so handsome! No wonder Jun’s dressing girly now—she’s snagged a pretty boy!”

“Mom! Enough!” Wang Jun nearly exploded.

“Ungrateful brat! I’m vetting him for you!” Their bickering continued, clearly a household routine.

Guan Yu interjected, “Auntie, I brought you a gift.” He handed over a box.

She unwrapped the luxurious rainbow-hued scarf. “Exquisite! Jun never gifts me anything!”

Draping it elegantly, she asked, “Does it suit me?”

“You’d beautify any accessory,” Guan Yu said earnestly.

“Such honesty! I approve.” After admiring the scarf, she turned serious. “As Jun’s boyfriend, what are your future plans?”
