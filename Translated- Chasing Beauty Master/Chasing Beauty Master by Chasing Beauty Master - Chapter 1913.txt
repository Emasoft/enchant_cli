“I believe that must be the case. Otherwise, such drastically mutated flying creatures would not have appeared among humans,” Elder Lu said gravely. “If my deduction is correct, creatures from the Demon Realm have returned to our world. There are two possibilities—either they are beings long hidden within that abyss, or the Demon Realm’s barrier has been breached again. Neither scenario bodes well for us.”

“Indeed,” Xuanming concurred, stroking his beard. “Demonic creatures are formidable adversaries we least wish to confront. Yet if the Demon Realm has truly invaded again, we have no choice but to respond. Guan Yu, you should investigate the abyss personally. Only by seeing it with your own eyes can you verify the truth of these reports.”

Though Xuanming privately doubted the abyss’s connection to Cloud Azure Sect’s affairs, the search for the East Sea Treasure, or the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, the situation had escalated. “This creature devours humans,” he continued. “As the foremost righteous sect in the martial world, we cannot ignore this threat to common folk. Our reputation demands action.”

**Chapter 5027: Assigning Missions**

“I understand,” Guan Yu replied. “Since this aligns with our northern expedition, I’ll investigate the abyss first. My theory is the East Sea Dragon Pearl has drawn these demons forth. Three decades ago, when Qiao Meiren (Lady Qiao) possessed the Pearl, it attracted the Demon Realm’s attention. After its disappearance, the incursions ceased. Now that the Pearl has resurfaced, so have they.”

“A plausible deduction,” Elder Lu nodded. “Legends say Qiao Meiren, wife of the former Martial Alliance Leader Dai Xiaotian, was actually a princess of the East Sea. The demons covet the Pearl for its rumored connection to the East Sea Treasure. History may be repeating itself.”

“What grand secret could this Pearl hold?” Xuanming mused. “If it were merely treasure, such chaos seems disproportionate.”

Elder Lu turned to Guan Yu. “This investigation falls to you—but tread carefully. The dangers are immense. Should you require reinforcements or resources, name them.”

“Solitude offers agility,” Guan Yu declined. “Companions might hinder more than help. I’ll travel with trusted allies. If we uncover the East Sea Treasure, Cloud Azure Sect will be notified immediately.”

After exchanging glances, the elders acquiesced. “Prioritize the abyss investigation,” Xuanming instructed. “Avoid direct confrontation with demons. Survival is paramount.”

“Elder Brother Sect Leader,” Elder Lu sighed, “A full-scale demon invasion would spell disaster.”

“Indeed,” Xuanming agreed. “Who knew the Dragon Pearl would reignite this turmoil? Yet if those beasts dare threaten humanity, we’ll answer with force. We must also alert Red Lotus Sect—Sun Lianzi’s cooperation could prove vital.”

“Wise,” Elder Lu said. “The Demon-Soul Sect’s resurgence complicates matters. Their interference could tip the scales.”

Guan Yu understood the unspoken pact: righteous sects like Cloud Azure and Red Lotus must unite against demonic threats. Commoners relied on cultivators’ strength where soldiers faltered. A single demonic spell could decimate battalions. Thus, sects embraced this duty—part altruism, part prestige-building, despite inevitable casualties.

Hypocrisy tinged Guan Yu’s thoughts. *So-called righteous sects play heroes when reputation’s at stake. Yet their posturing might save lives. Cloud Azure will lead the charge, as expected of the ‘foremost sect.’*

After minimal preparations, Guan Yu departed. Elder Lu’s parting admonition echoed: “Survive above all.” Wang Jun’s request to join was denied—his Blood Toxin required intensive cultivation. Only Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi accompanied him, their journey to the capital leisurely until urgency resumed.

At the驸马爷府 (Imperial Son-in-Law’s Manor), Jiang Yuankai greeted Guan Yu. “Preparations are complete, Brother Wanhong, but I’ve an additional favor.”

“Speak freely,” Guan Yu replied, trusting the noble’s integrity.

Jiang sighed. “Princess Anping agreed to seek refuge in the palace, but my daughter Xin’er refuses. She insists on joining us—into danger! I hoped you might persuade her.”

“She must stay,” Guan Yu agreed. “Shall I enlist Chu Fan? He holds sway over her.”

“Strange,” Jiang frowned. “Lately, she speaks highly of you. Your words might carry weight.”

Guan Yu hesitated, recalling Jiang Xin’s recent… attentions. “Chu Fan remains our best recourse.”

**Chapter 5028: A Shared Thought**

Jiang Yuankai’s hopeful gaze intensified. Reluctantly, Guan Yu conceded to approach Chu Fan. Before he could depart, Jiang Xin intercepted him at the gates.

“Avoiding me?” she accused. “I sent word, yet you flee like a startled hare!”

“Urgent matters demand haste,” Guan Yu deflected. “Lives hang in the balance.”

“Spare me excuses!” she retorted. “Even emperors indulge my whims. Yet you dismiss me as a burden?”

Guan Yu stood firm. “The north teems with demons. You’d be a liability. Palace security surpasses any we offer. Once we remove the Dragon Pearl, you’ll be safe.”

Tears glistened, but Guan Yu pressed on: “Assist Chu Fan with the Vermilion Opera House. Its reopening deserves your touch. This isn’t play—it’s survival.”

**Chapter 5029: Great Changes**

Jiang Xin’s lip trembled, unaccustomed to rejection. Guan Yu softened his tone. “Your courage is noted, but true strength lies in wise retreat. Protect what you’ve built here.”

As she stormed off, Guan Yu exhaled. Alliances required delicate balances—especially where hearts wandered. The path north promised bloodshed, not romance. He’d need every wit to navigate the coming storm.
