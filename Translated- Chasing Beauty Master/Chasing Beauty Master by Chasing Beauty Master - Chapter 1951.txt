The scene before them was formidable. Though Elder Jiu and other elders were absent, and the Yunqing Sect had not mobilized its full strength, the assembled force was already overwhelmingly powerful.

At present, excluding the Yunqing Sect and the Mohist Soul Sect, the Red Lotus Sect was the weakest faction. Xuanming’s sudden appearance had caught Sun Lianzi entirely off guard.

After all, rumors of Xuanming personally taking action had circulated throughout their journey, but they had never encountered him. She had dismissed it as mere gossip—until now.

“Sect Leader Xuanming, I trust you witnessed what just transpired,” Sun Lianzi began, her tone sly. “Guan Yu shielded that witch from the Mohist Soul Sect and injured my disciple with a hidden weapon. This matter cannot be brushed aside.”

“Had your incompetent disciple not struck first, none of this would have occurred,” Xuanming retorted coldly. “Now that you’ve suffered losses, you seek to shift blame. Let’s dispense with pretense—your true aim is the Dragon Pearl of the East Sea. Spare us the theatrics.”

Xuanming continued defending Guan Yu, for in his eyes, Guan Yu remained a disciple of the Yunqing Sect’s Tiger’s Head Peak. With the Dragon Pearl effectively in their grasp, Xuanming naturally sought to protect their claim.

“Xuanming, your reasoning is utterly biased!” Sun Lianzi argued. “My disciple merely sought to discipline Guan Yu. As a Yunqing disciple, he shamelessly consorts with a demonic woman—does he not deserve correction? Moreover, while discipline is one matter, Guan Yu nearly killed my disciple with a crossbow bolt. This cannot be overlooked!”

“Guan Yu is a disciple of the Yunqing Sect. Whether right or wrong, his judgment rests with us. What concern is it of the Red Lotus Sect?” Xuanming declared resolutely. “The Dragon Pearl now lies within Yunqing’s grasp. Your sophistry here is meaningless.”

Sun Lianzi fell silent. She cared nothing for her injured disciple nor Guan Yu’s ties to the demonic sect—further arguments would prove futile.

“If you insist on shielding this traitor, I have nothing more to say,” she spat. “Though I wish to avoid bloodshed here, do not mistake the Red Lotus Sect’s restraint for fear of your Yunqing Sect!”

Initially appearing the weakest of the three factions, the Red Lotus Sect’s numbers swelled steadily as reinforcements arrived—eventually surpassing the other groups severalfold. These were martial experts summoned over recent days, now deployed to decisive effect.

Though few cultivators accompanied the Red Lotus Sect, their martial masters posed a lethal threat in close combat—enough to give even Yunqing disciples pause before a blade’s edge.

The eastern beach grew increasingly crowded. Beyond the three major factions, smaller groups lingered warily at the periphery, observing the tension without intervening.

“Guan Yu,” Xuanming commanded coldly, “to avoid further gossip, come to me at once and surrender the Dragon Pearl.” He recognized the gathering storm—securing the relic became imperative.

Guan Yu stood firm. “Master, this Dragon Pearl does not belong to me. It was temporarily entrusted by Prince Consort Jiang. I cannot yield it to you.”

“What did you say?!” Xuanming’s eyebrow twitched. “Do you dare defy your master’s order?”

By contradicting Xuanming publicly, Guan Yu had delivered a stinging rebuke. Sun Lianzi burst into mocking laughter. “Oh, Xuanming! Is this your prized disciple? How amusing! He ceased obeying you long ago—why posture as some revered patriarch now?”

Traditionally suppressed by the Yunqing Sect, the Red Lotus Sect now cast aside notions of righteousness and demonic affiliation. In this contest for unimaginable riches, only the final claimant of the East Sea’s treasures would emerge victorious.

Already incensed, Xuanming’s fury flared hotter at Sun Lianzi’s taunts. With a flick of his sleeve, he unleashed a wind spell toward Guan Yu—only for the Demon Lord to intercept it midair.

“Discipline your disciple if you must,” the Demon Lord drawled, “but my Rong’er stands beside him. Harm her, and we settle this differently. Save your lectures for your sect halls.”

This intervention, whether born of genuine concern for Wang Xiaorong or ulterior motives, somewhat rehabilitated the Demon Lord’s image in Guan Yu’s eyes—at least he retained shreds of humanity.

“Have you forgotten your place, Guan Yu?” Xuanming’s voice dripped frost. “The Yunqing Sect has treated you well. Will you truly hide behind these demons now?”

“Master, I hide behind none—not even the Yunqing Sect. I’ve never sought its protection as a shield.”

Elder Lu stepped forward urgently. “Guan Yu, cease this folly! With Sect Leader and us here, no force present can threaten you. We alone truly care for your safety—come to us now!”

Guan Yu acknowledged Elder Lu’s sincerity—a rarity among their sect. “Uncle Lu, I thank you for your care. Within Yunqing, only you showed true concern. But here, I must protect those beside me. I cannot leave.”

“What a lively spectacle,” the Demon Lord interjected. “Xuanming, your disciple defies you. Guan Yu possesses unparalleled dual mastery of martial and demonic arts—a prodigy seen once in millennia. If you cannot control him, best eliminate him now. Once he matures, even your Dragon Subduing Sword may prove inadequate. The regret then will be yours alone.”

**Chapter 5127: First Glimpse of the Dragon Subduing Sword**

The Demon Lord deliberately provoked Xuanming, knowing conflict between master and disciple would force Guan Yu to their side through Wang Xiaorong’s influence. Resolved to assist Guan Yu under pretext of protecting his daughter, the Demon Lord aimed to secure the Dragon Pearl through alliance.

Now consistently supporting Guan Yu despite prior tensions, the Demon Lord dismissed past grievances.

“Yunqing’s affairs require no demonic interference,” Xuanming snapped.

“I’ve no interest in your sect’s petty dramas,” the Demon Lord countered. “My concern is this—none shall harm Guan Yu today. Should anyone injure Rong’er, they become my sworn enemy.”

“Absurd threats!” Xuanming’s temper flared. “Do you think I fear you?” As the Demon Lord fanned the flames, Xuanming’s right hand flicked—a lightning spell coalesced instantly above Guan Yu’s group.

Before evasion became possible, thunderbolts arced downward—a testament to Xuanming’s fearsome prowess. Even Wang Xiaorong would need preparation time for such magic, yet Xuanming unleashed it effortlessly.

The Demon Lord waved a hand, summoning a black barrier that absorbed the lightning like pebbles vanishing in an ocean. “How ruthless, Xuanming—attacking your own disciple so viciously!”

“Meddlesome fool!” Xuanming roared. “A century has passed since our last duel. Let us settle this today!”

Yunqing disciples shifted into combat stances as Mohist elites flanked their lord, weapons drawn. Xuanming’s hand shot toward the box Xiao Dong carried—it flew open midair, releasing azure radiance that materialized into an immense, broad-bladed sword.

“The Dragon Subduing Sword!” Sun Lianzi gasped.

All present beheld Yunqing’s legendary blade for the first time—save Sun Lianzi and the Demon Lord. To Guan Yu, the sword exuded divine majesty, its aura both intimidating and awe-inspiring—truly a celestial artifact.

Grasping the sword, Xuanming engaged the Demon Lord without hesitation. The latter laughed exultantly: “A hundred years since I last faced this bloodstained blade! Let us see if it’s grown dull!”

As the leaders clashed, their factions erupted into battle—Mohist elders conjured dark shields while Yunqing’s councilors formed azure domes, each side probing for weaknesses.

Guan Yu’s group observed neutrally, though Wang Xiaorong tensed watching her father confront the Dragon Subduing Sword. Sun Lianzi likewise remained aloof, waiting to scavenge victory from mutual exhaustion.

Within breaths, Xuanming’s sword conjured countless blades from thin air, raining toward the Demon Lord—only to be halted by expanding black barriers. As spells collided, Xuanming’s sword blazed like a sapphire sun, its magnified form crashing downward with draconic roars that sent sand and stone flying.

The Demon Lord dissolved into smoke, evading the strike before reengaging—their duel escalating in ferocity.

A Red Lotus elder whispered to Sun Lianzi: “While they’re distracted, let us seize the Dragon Pearl from Guan Yu.”

**Chapter 5128: Rescue Arrives**

Sun Lianzi nodded. Though risking ridicule, the prize justified all. “To ensure success, I’ll handle this personally.”

Anticipating their move, Guan Yu raised Soulfall Blade to shield his companions—only for Sun Lianzi’s meteor spell to shatter his barrier instantly. Outmatched, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong combined efforts, but Red Lotus elders’ coordinated magic overwhelmed them.

A spatial rift yawned above, hurling boulders that shattered successive shields. Guan Yu’s spiritual reserves drained—even Soulfall Blade’s energies dwindled.

The Demon Lord, locked in combat, couldn’t assist. Guan Yu tasted despair—Sun Lianzi’s next attack would finish them. Desperately gripping Wang Xiaorong’s hand, he met her fearful yet resolute gaze.

As death loomed, a familiar voice pierced the chaos—but that tale unfolds elsewhere.
