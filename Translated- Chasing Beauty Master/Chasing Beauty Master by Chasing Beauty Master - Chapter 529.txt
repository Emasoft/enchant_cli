After Guan Yu finished speaking, he returned with Patriarch Allen and the others. The crowd below, initially eager to witness a spectacle, grew disgruntled upon hearing they’d have to wait until tomorrow.

When Guan Yu and Patriarch Allen’s group entered the rest chamber, a heavy silence enveloped them. Worry etched every face.

“Patriarch Allen,” Fiat finally broke the quiet, “must we truly face Locke in combat tomorrow?”

Allen glanced at him. “Do you think I jest?”

Fiat promptly fell silent. Indeed, regardless of their chances, they couldn’t back out after publicly declaring their intent.

“Father,” Amy interjected, clutching her Bika Cat, “why must you fight? I don’t want to see you, Brother Dragon, or anyone else hurt.”

Allen gently stroked her forehead. “Amy, many things in this world lie beyond our control. If peace could solve everything, who would choose bloodshed?”

“But if you simply yielded the patriarchy to Locke, wouldn’t that stop the fighting?”

The room froze at Amy’s words. All eyes turned to Allen, bracing for his reaction.

After a weighted pause, Allen sighed deeply. “I know some believe I cling to power at the clan’s expense. Let me clarify—my fight isn’t for personal glory. Locke possesses remarkable talent, surpassing even my younger self. Yet he must never lead our clan.”

“Absolutely!” someone agreed. “If Locke becomes patriarch, our Elven clan will perish!”

“Patriarch,” another added, “yesterday, when Elder Shituo and I returned from Jinzhou City, we noticed Dark Mercenary assassins connected to Locke.”

“What? Has he colluded with humans?!”

“That wretched boy! I’ll tear him limb from limb!”

“Enough,” Allen raised a hand. “My sole purpose is securing our clan’s future. After this term, I’ll groom younger successors. In ten years, they’ll compete for leadership.”

Nods of approval circled the room. Amy brightened—without her mother, she longed for more time with her father.

Guan Yu felt relieved but focused on the immediate challenge. “First, we must secure your position. Otherwise, all plans are moot.”

Their strategizing stretched into afternoon. Restless, Guan Yu slipped outside, followed by Amy and her feline companion.

Glaring at the cat, Guan Yu muttered, “I’m facing death while you lounge about?”

“Brother Dragon, what did you say?” Amy asked.

“Nothing! Say, doesn’t this cat seem... unusual?”

Amy shook her head, oblivious. Guan Yu sighed inwardly—at least the creature hadn’t caused trouble.

The Bika Cat meowed indignantly, as if retorting, “Worry about your own hide!”

As they walked, a figure materialized ahead—a woman in azure robes, breathtakingly beautiful.

“Roxie!” Amy dashed forward. “Why are you here? I’ve missed you!”

Guan Yu’s stomach dropped. Scolding awaited.

After brief pleasantries with Amy, Roxie fixed Guan Yu with a piercing gaze. “Why remain here?”

“Why shouldn’t I?”

Her laugh held frost. “Of course—Lord Guan Yu, savior of elves. Where else would our hero be?”

Recognizing her sarcasm about his involvement, Guan Yu stood speechless.

They locked eyes. Suddenly, Roxie threw herself against his chest, fists pounding. “Explain yourself!”

He endured her blows silently.

Amy watched, bewildered. The Bika Cat sighed dramatically, “Ah, love’s cruel whims bind life to death.”

“Who said that?” Amy glanced around, finding no one. “Your madness is contagious!”

After minutes of weeping, Roxie tried pulling away. Guan Yu tightened his embrace.

“Strike me then flee? Unthinkable.”

“You brute! Release me!” she protested weakly.

He kissed her forehead. “Precisely. This brute claims what’s his.”

“People are watching!”

Amy covered her eyes. The cat stared unabashedly until Guan Yu threatened, “Lose those eyes, furball?”

It buried its face in Amy’s chest, drawing Guan Yu’s ire. “Stop molesting my women!”

The cat peeked out, muttering, “Damned if I look, damned if I don’t.”

Their banter halted when a guard summoned Guan Yu to Allen.

Roxie straightened, flushed. “Go. Just... return safely.”

Clasping her hands, Guan Yu vowed, “I’ll not fail you.”

As he left, resolve hardened within him. “Locke, our reckoning comes. The humiliations of Tigerhead Mountain will be repaid in blood.”

The Bika Cat trotted alongside. “Love’s a powerful motivator. When do I get a mate?”

“Dead men need no cats,” Guan Yu retorted. “Perish with me tomorrow.”

“Typical! You hoard wives while I—”

“Brother Dragon,” Amy interrupted, “who are you talking to? Ghosts?”

She clung to him fearfully. The cat received a kick for its troubles.

Returning to Allen’s chamber, they found Elder Shituo and Fiat waiting.

“Guan Yu,” Allen began gravely, “we’ve reconsidered. As an outsider, withdrawing now might—”

“Withdraw? After pledging?” Guan Yu cut in. “This clan is my home. I stay.”

Moved yet conflicted, Allen conceded. “Should we prevail, the Elven Clan will owe you eternal gratitude.”

“I seek no rewards. Family needs no payment.”

The Bika Cat nipped his ankle, sensing his unspoken thought: *If you’re grateful, let me marry your daughter!*

Elder Shituo noted their exchange. “That ‘harmless’ cat aided your dragon illusion earlier, yes? It’s clearly a magical beast.”

Guan Yu deflected, “Merely a recent capture. Its secrets remain unknown.”

As night fell in his quarters, the cat pressed, “Can you defeat Locke?”

“Uncertain. Why this sudden concern?”

“A loyal subordinate worries!”

Guan Yu snorted. “More like self-preservation.”

The cat’s tail twitched. “Survive tomorrow, and I’ll find my own mate. Until then... try not to die.”
