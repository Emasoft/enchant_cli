“Then tell me, what exactly should be done when someone reneges on their debt?” Xiaomei gazed at Guanyu with a trace of reproach in her eyes, yet remained willing to heed his opinion. Everything now depended on what brilliant suggestion Guanyu could offer.

**Chapter 4598: Knowing When to Stop**

Guanyu adopted a solemn expression. “First, this gentleman is a Hall Master—a man of status and position. Asking such a distinguished figure to lick your shoes before so many disciples is clearly excessive. I believe some magnanimity would be appropriate.”

“So I should just swallow this loss?” Xiaomei retorted bitterly. “I’m the winner here. Had I lost, he would’ve demanded I accompany him for days. Do you think he’d show me any mercy then?”

Her sharp rebuttal left Guanyu momentarily speechless. Truthfully, her logic was impeccable.

The Hall Master sneered coldly, “I’ve no interest in snakes.”

“What’s wrong with being a snake?” Xiaomei shot back, standing on tiptoe to point accusingly. “Even a snake defeated you fair and square!”

Guanyu interjected, “Let’s focus on the present situation. We must avoid extremes and coercion, lest we invite greater complications. I suspect the Hall Master’s pride won’t permit shoe-licking. Why not compromise? Perhaps we could forgo that humiliation in exchange for monetary compensation?” He glanced between them, confident this solution satisfied all parties.

As a prominent figure of the wealth-flush Demon Soul Sect, this Hall Master’s coffers were surely ample.

Xiaomei’s silent contemplation suggested agreement—silver seemed preferable to empty vengeance. The portly Hall Master grimaced, trapped by his public blunder before so many witnesses. Any mishandling would become lasting ridicule.

“Very well,” the Hall Master relented, producing a money pouch. “Take this as my concession. Meeting you today was misfortune incarnate.” Guanyu accepted the bag, estimating fifty taels within—a substantial sum.

“Sect Leader, let’s depart with this silver,” Guanyu urged, relieved at the resolution.

“This pittance? Are we beggars?” Xiaomei shook the pouch disdainfully, her nose wrinkling at the metallic scent.

Guanyu blinked in surprise. Fifty taels represented extraordinary generosity—why this ingratitude?

“Sect Leader, we should quit while ahead. This isn’t our territory for haggling.” He noted the Hall Master’s darkening expression. Should they push further, violence might erupt.

Under normal circumstances, Xiaomei would’ve danced for joy at fifty taels. But emboldened by Guanyu’s previous 800-tael gift, her standards had inflated.

“It’s more than fair,” Guanyu insisted. “This could buy countless shoes. Let’s leave before tempers flare.” He tugged her sleeve, urging retreat. Xiaomei finally relented, though suspicion lingered about hidden wealth.

The Hall Master watched their departure bitterly, cursing his folly in being bested by a serpent spirit. Such humiliation would haunt him.

**Chapter 4599: Safety First**

Guanyu hurriedly organized their group. “Prepare to move out—our true mission awaits.”

Despite minor injuries, Xiaomei rode her camel cheerfully, jingling her new silver. “Old Guan, I’ve realized something,” she announced suddenly.

Guanyu tensed, conscious of Siqi’s proximity. “What? Fake silver?” he deflected, recalling his earlier “supportive” touches during her injury.

Xiaomei bit a coin experimentally. “Genuine! Though reeking of salted fish. Had they been counterfeit...” Her eyes narrowed dangerously.

“Thank heavens they’re real,” Guanyu sighed. “Now what’s this realization?”

“We’re financial soulmates!” she trilled. “Since meeting you, my coffers overflow! You’re my prosperity god!”

Guanyu preened until noticing Siqi’s stormy expression. “Many find me auspicious,” he backpedaled. “Siqi, shall we rest? The fog thickens.”

Siqi declined tersely. “We must reach Miao City swiftly.”

“We’re nearing,” Xiaomei interjected. “Let’s pause here. The city’s emergence should be visible from afar come the 15th.”

As they settled, two robed figures materialized through the mist. “Who goes there?” challenged Guanyu. “We’re from the Heterodox Sect passing through.”

The strangers circled warily before vanishing like desert phantoms.

“Remain vigilant,” Siqi cautioned. “This fog breeds danger.”

Xiaomei returned from scouting. “A hundred Demon Soul Sect members ahead—we’re close to Miao City.”

Guanyu grimaced. The sect’s multiple encampments suggested strategic positioning around the city’s predicted emergence point. Shadowing them might prove wiser than blind navigation.

“This cursed fog,” Xiaomei grumbled. “It heralds storms. Rain approaches.”

Guanyu’s mind raced. The prophecy’s lines—*Under golden city, atop divine stone mountains, when flowers bloom and fragrant winds carry, divine power manifests*—required specific conditions. Without blazing sun to create the “golden city” illusion on July 15th, Miao City might remain hidden.

“If rains come...” Guanyu muttered, “we’ll have journeyed in vain.”

**Chapter 4600: Wasting Time**

Xiaomei tilted her head. “Abandon our quest because of rain?”

“The ‘golden city’ requires sun-baked sands,” Guanyu explained. “No sunlight, no illusion—no Miao City. Previous absences likely stemmed from unmet weather conditions.”

The group concurred. Each phrase from Meng Hua Ancestor’s prophecy held literal truth. Historical Miao City sightings coincided with the golden mirage phenomenon.

Calculating dates, Guanyu fretted. Six days remained until July 15th. Should rains fall now, the desert wouldn’t dry sufficiently for the required spectacle.

“Does fog always precede desert rains?” he pressed Xiaomei.

“Uncertain,” she shrugged. “Why? Will you flee at first drizzle?”

“If rains prevent the golden city,” Guanyu declared, “staying becomes folly. We’d be wasting...” His words trailed off as distant shouts echoed through the mist.
