“By the way, I heard Uncle has been away on business these days?”

“Yes, the master traveled far to discuss a major deal. He mentioned being inspired by you and plans to make grand moves. He'll return in a few days.”

Guan Yu nodded. “I see. That leaves the household entirely in your hands, Steward Sun.” Internally, Guan Yu wondered: *This steward clearly seems suspicious. Why can't Uncle and the others see it?*

*Uncle should be shrewd. How could he trust Steward Sun so completely? With several daughters-in-law and grandchildren in the house, how could he feel at ease leaving everything to this steward?*

Guan Yu couldn't fathom it. Even if Uncle had been inspired by his previous words, he should have taken time to discuss details. Why rush off to negotiate deals with such confidence?

*Overthinking won't help now. Steward Sun's odd behavior needs proper investigation when there's time.*

“Indeed,” Steward Sun replied courteously. “Before leaving, the master instructed me to ensure your comfort as honored guests. Please don't hesitate to make requests.” Guan Yu detected insincerity beneath the politeness.

“Thank you, Steward Sun. I'll take my leave now—there are matters to attend to.” Smiling, Guan Yu turned toward Jin Ci Yu Lang's quarters.

As anyone with half a brain could guess, that layabout Jin Ci Yu Lang was still asleep. The martial arts master never bothered locking doors—a testament to his confidence against assassins.

Barging in, Guan Yu yanked the covers off. “Rise and eat! Depart quickly—no delays. I’m uneasy about affairs here.”

Jin Ci Yu Lang groaned, “Let me sleep more. Must you pester at dawn?”

“Damn it! You’ve slept nine hours already! Pig!”

“Lies!” Jin Ci Yu Lang protested. “I only returned at two a.m.! Let a man live!”

**Chapter 3439: Departure**

“Two a.m.? What were you doing?” Guan Yu snatched the quilt and threw it down. “Confess! Where were you last night?”

Jin Ci Yu Lang looked like a village woman caught in adultery, eyes brimming with grievance. “Ungrateful wretch! While you fools lazed about, I scouted Duobao Mountain last night! Knowing we’d leave today, I wanted to help—yet you scorn my efforts!”

He postured like some noble, anonymous hero. Guan Yu scoffed, “Idiot! Every sect—even demonic cults—has combed Duobao Mountain. What could you find? Night breezes? Think me a child to deceive?”

Jin Ci Yu Lang’s expression shifted. “Guan Yu... there’s something you should know.”

“Spit it out, then get up!”

Rising dramatically, Jin Ci Yu Lang declared, “Don’t you think Steward Sun is suspicious?”

“You noticed too?” Guan Yu closed the door cautiously. “I’ve long suspected him. What did you find?”

“He obsesses over the back garden—like searching for lost treasure. This morning, I saw him by the rockery with shears, not using them.”

“Watch him closely. Whether major or minor, we must uncover his secrets.”

Guan Yu agreed. “Handle that later. Your priority is rushing to Qiaoyuan District—I fear for their safety.” Seeing Guan Yu’s worry, Jin Ci Yu Lang grinned. “Relax. I’ll relocate them to Huayu Corporation as planned.”

“If they ask about me, say I’m working on breaking the seal here.”

“Understood. I won’t mention Siqi or Wang Xiaorong.”

“Damn you! As if I care!”

Chuckling at Guan Yu’s scowl, Jin Ci Yu Lang said, “Enough jokes. Get Steward Sun to prepare a fast horse—I’ll leave now.”

“At least eat first!”

“I’ll grab food outside—quicker that way.”

After procuring silver, supplies, and a horse from Steward Sun, Jin Ci Yu Lang departed.

“Guan Yu,” he warned solemnly from horseback, “this isn’t City A. One misstep and there’s no undoing death.”

Waving him off, Guan Yu retorted, “Go! I’ll stay alive till your return.”

Watching Jin Ci Yu Lang’s figure shrink into the distance, Guan Yu finally relaxed—the women in Qiaoyuan District were now safeguarded.

**Chapter 3440: Acquiring Treasure**

“Guan Yu! What luck!”

Turning, Guan Yu spotted Young Master Men approaching with an attendant. “Men Gongzi? What brings you here at dawn?”

“I inquired yesterday—you’re staying with Uncle Qin?” Men Gongzi smiled, reassessing Guan Yu’s status. Uncle Qin’s philanthropic reputation in Qujiang City eclipsed even the local magistrate’s prestige.

Guan Yu coldly acknowledged, “Yes, my uncle’s home.” He noticed Men Gongzi wearing the Jade Bagua pendant like Yue Jing. *Perfect—let Red Lotus Sect harass him instead.*

Men Gongzi produced the pendant. “Isn’t this yours? You left it at Echo Pavilion.”

Feigning admiration, Guan Yu said, “Superb jade! Mine? No...”

Snatching it back, Men Gongzi feigned confusion. “My mistake. Must’ve acquired it elsewhere.”

“Not mine,” Guan Yu lied. “First time seeing it. Echo Pavilion find?”

“Apparently so!” Men Gongzi reattached the pendant gleefully. “Join me for celebratory drinks?”

“Regrettably, prior engagements. Another time.”

After Men Gongzi hurried off, Guan Yu smirked. *Let Red Lotus come for him now.*

**Chapter 3441: Gathering Friends**

Men Gongzi strutted toward Echo Pavilion, flaunting his new prize. “Summon Li Gongzi and his clique—I’ll host them here!”

At Echo Pavilion, a new greeter caught his eye—Xiao Bao, curvaceous and fair-skinned. “Fresh face? Clever of Madam Xi Liu to station beauties upfront.”

“I’ve been here six months, Young Master. My name is Xiao Bao.”

“Delightful! Reserve a large parlor—friends are coming.”

Xiao Bao guided him upstairs, hiding disdain for his lecherous gaze. Though desperate to escape poverty through marriage, she guarded her virginity fiercely—her bargaining chip for a wealthy match.

When asked her age, she demurred, “Sixteen, freshly bloomed.”

Men Gongzi’s eyes glinted. Today promised multiple pleasures—showing off his Jade Bagua and sampling new delights. The pendant glowed at his waist, a beacon for trouble he remained blissfully unaware of.
