“I also only heard about it recently. After my injuries healed on the way back, I learned of Xiao Zhi’s situation. He was truly wronged. Since Yanzao had been his role model, Xiao Zhi deeply trusted everything Yanzao did. Perhaps while returning through the Gate of Two Realms, Yanzao secretly poisoned him?”

“Exactly. It was on the return journey. After arriving, Yanzao made Xiao Zhi’s blood poison erupt publicly here, leading to his imprisonment,” Chief Lu said bitterly.

Guanyu remarked, “Yanzao intended to silence witnesses. After eliminating Xiao Zhi, I would have been next. But he never anticipated the heavens’ unpredictability – that he himself would end up fleeing like a starving refugee.”

Xuanming sighed deeply. “Calculating the years, Yanzao had been at our Cloud Azure Sect for nearly fifty years. He always performed excellently in all aspects. Who could have imagined...”

Chapter 3,829: Truly Unthinkable

Xuanming continued, “I originally thought rare to find such capable disciples as Yanzao – a cultivation genius born with innate talent. How could he become a demon sect member? What benefits could they possibly offer him?”

“This isn’t about benefits,” Guanyu countered. “In my view, Yanzao genuinely wanted to achieve greatness in our sect. But fate played tricks. He likely accidentally contracted the demon sect’s blood poison, forcing him to serve them.”

“If that were true, why didn’t he confess earlier? I could have helped him,” Xuanming said.

“It’s far more complicated. Yanzao had committed many shameful acts against the sect. Even if you knew, the demon sect would expose his crimes once losing control. He’d still lose everything.”

Guanyu added, “Moreover, Yanzao’s immense pride made him maintain a flawless image. Revealing such shadows would ruin his reputation among disciples, hindering his ascent in the sect.”

Chief Lu nodded. “Thus one misstep leads to more. He kept erring, harming others and himself. No wonder the demon sect controlled him.”

After hesitation, Chief Lu asked, “Sect Master, that black-furred monster killing Left Void Peak disciple Acai in the woods... could it have been Yanzao?”

“Highly possible. Our inspections only revealed a minor Left Void Peak disciple. If not him, it must be Yanzao,” Xuanming concluded.

Guanyu suddenly recalled Wang Jun, who served the Demon Soul Sect due to blood poison. Since only one disciple was found, had Wang Jun escaped detection... or fled like Yanzao? Glancing toward Bamboo Peak revealed no sign of him.

Guanyu warned, “Master, today’s efforts have limited effect. The deepest moles remain hidden – they don’t carry blood poison. We need alternative methods. Moreover, high-ranking traitors exist with extensive intelligence networks. Only rooting them out constitutes true cleansing.”

“Easier said. For millennia, orthodox and demon sects have clashed. These spies are deeply entrenched,” Xuanming sighed.

“This requires patience,” Chief Lu interjected. “Guanyu, may I examine that weapon you injured Chief Xiang with? I’m intensely curious.”

“Of course. As mentioned, this is from my homeland.” Guanyu handed over the Desert Eagle, cautioning, “This is the trigger. Never pull it – accidental discharge kills.”

Chief Lu marveled at the weighty metal construction. “Such precise metalwork must demand exceptional craftsmanship. But how does it wound? Not spiritual energy... internal qi?”

“Neither. Merely pull the trigger without any energy.” Guanyu retrieved it. “Let me disassemble it for explanation.”

Xuanming’s eyes gleamed at replication prospects. Such flawless killing tools were unprecedented in his long life.

Guanyu knew local craftsmanship couldn’t produce firearms lacking proper facilities. Even crude imitations failed without gunpowder and spring technology. However, crossbows might be feasible in this backward society lacking even basic ranged weapons.

Sitting on the ground amidst lingering inspections, Guanyu demonstrated before gathering disciples. Removing the magazine, he displayed a bullet. “This projectile penetrates targets while the casing ejects here.”

Disassembling the pistol, he explained springs and firing mechanisms until realizing their incomprehension. Struggling to reassemble the firearm, he concluded technical explanations were futile.

Chapter 3,830: Next Decisions

Chief Lu examined bullets in awe. “These identical metal projectiles require unimaginable skill! Each must take immense time!”

Guanyu smiled. “Even master artisans can’t craft these. They’re machine-made. My homeland produces thousands daily.”

“Machines making themselves? Unfathomable!” Chief Lu exclaimed.

Xuanming shook his head. “This treasure surpasses high-grade magical artifacts. Could you replicate it?”

“Impossible here without proper equipment,” Guanyu admitted. “But I can teach crossbow-making – simpler and practical.”

As other chiefs reported clean inspection results, Guanyu nearly collapsed from two days’ travel without rest. Chief Lu mercifully suggested adjourning.

Next day, Guanyu presented crossbow blueprints in the main hall. “If mass-produced, every disciple armed could crush demon sects!”

Xuanming scrutinized the diagrams skeptically. “Arrows reaching hundreds of meters?”

“Depending on materials,” Guanyu explained. “Steel arrows with powerful bows could achieve terrifying range. Superior to my pistol’s power.”

When discussing materials, Guanyu’s eyes gleamed at accessing the sect’s hidden repository. “We’ll need skilled artisans and quality materials from our stores.”

As plans progressed, Guanyu remembered his dwindling ammunition – only twelve bullets remained. Yet crossbow production could compensate.

Chapter 3,831: No Permission

Presenting his designs, Guanyu boasted, “Once crafted, Cloud Azure disciples will become unstoppable!”

Xuanming remained doubtful until Guanyu described Western military crossbows with 800-meter range. “What resources do you require?”

“Access to the sect’s material repository,” Guanyu ventured, eyeing Xuanming’s reaction, knowing of hidden treasures in remote mountain vaults.

The sect leader hesitated, protective of their reserves. Before negotiations concluded, the meeting dispersed with unresolved tensions – innovation clashing with tradition, modernity challenging ancient ways, as Cloud Azure Sect stood at technological crossroads.
