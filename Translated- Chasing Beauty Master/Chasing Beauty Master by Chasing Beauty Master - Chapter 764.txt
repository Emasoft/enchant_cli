Guan Yu approached Du Zhao, seeing the latter’s provocatively punchable face, raised his baton and prepared to strike Du Zhao’s head.

Terrified, Du Zhao pleaded desperately, “Lord Guan! Lord Guan, show mercy! Have mercy...”

Seeing Du Zhao’s earlier arrogance completely replaced by pitiful groveling as he sat on the ground, Guan Yu halted his strike.

“Spare me, Lord Guan! I was wrong! I’ll never dare again! Please, with your great magnanimity, forgive me this once!” Du Zhao continued begging, noticing Guan Yu’s murderous aura remained undiminished. He prayed the enraged youth wouldn’t beat him to death.

Guan Yu pointed the baton at the cowering figure and roared, “Listen well—I rule Kaihuang Academy! Even the principal’s authority means nothing here. Today, I’ll let you keep your wretched life!”

The surrounding students gasped. Guan Yu had openly declared the principal inferior to a fart in his eyes—such audacity!

After throwing down this declaration, Guan Yu stormed toward the woods behind campus, suspecting Jia Bo had been ambushed there. Du Zhao glared venomously at his retreating figure, inwardly seething: “Guan Yu, you son of a bitch! Just wait—one day you’ll kneel and lick my shoes!”

Wei Hongwei called. “Where are you?” Guan Yu demanded first.

“Taking Jia Bo to the hospital. His head’s bleeding—needs bandaging,” Wei replied.

“Who did this? Why?”

“We were recruiting for our Yu Gang when Sun Xu’s thugs attacked Jia Bo without warning. They outnumbered us—we couldn’t fight back.”

Guan Yu grimaced. Establishing the Yu Gang would inevitably provoke rival factions, but he hadn’t expected such brazen violence during his absence. Sun Xu’s name burned into his memory—retribution would come.

Hanging up, Guan Yu encountered two approaching figures—Xie Yulu and Xia Jinhua, the same “unconventional” female classmates he’d helped during the McDonald’s incident.

“Guan Yu, got a moment? We need to talk,” Xie Yulu said boldly, arms entwined with Xia Jinhua in an intimate pose that unsettled Guan Yu despite their confidence.

Though anxious to check on Jia Bo, Guan Yu asked, “What is it?”

Xie stepped forward. “We want to join the Yu Gang. Are we qualified?”

This surprised him. While school gangs abounded, female members were rare—especially beauties like these who usually basked in male attention. Xie Yulu, with her alluring figure and pansexual reputation, swayed provocatively before him. Had her preferences been different, Guan Yu might’ve pursued her.

“Why?” he asked.

“You’re handsome, and we’d feel safer in your gang,” Xie giggled.

Guan Yu nodded. “Register with Wei Hongwei. But there are no female members yet—gossip might follow.”

Instantly regretting his words, he feared offending them. But Xie smiled. “We don’t care about gossip.”

After arranging follow-up details, Guan Yu rushed to the hospital. Jia Bo’s bandaged head and Wei’s swollen lip confirmed their beating.

Discovering security team members lurking near Jia Bo’s room, Guan Yu sneered, “This hospital’s for humans, not dogs stinking up the air. Let’s move.” The guards seethed but dared not retort.

Relocating Jia Bo to Pan Taisheng’s secure apartment, Guan Yu thanked the man. “No need for formalities,” Pan boomed. “My sister Pan Xiaoxia speaks highly of you. Your friends are welcome here anytime.”

Later, while informing Wei about the girls’ recruitment, Guan Yu learned Xie Yulu’s rumored affair with Principal Zhang Taiping. “The principal bought her a villa and Range Rover,” Wei revealed.

A sudden call from Pan Xiaoxia disconnected immediately. Guan Yu’s attempts to redial failed. Alarmed, he contacted Lü Mei, who reported Pan’s disappearance.

Realizing the principal must have orchestrated this, Guan Yu enlisted Hou Jinshun’s help. At school, they barged into Liu Shuowei’s office—catching the vice-principal mid-indecency with porn blaring.

“Zhang Taiping’s number. Now,” Guan Yu demanded, snatching Liu’s phone.

When connected, the principal taunted, “You’ve beaten my guards yet dare call me?”

“Where’s Pan Xiaoxia?” Guan Yu growled.

“Fuck you! I’ll cripple you, you little—” Zhang’s obscene tirade ended with a slammed receiver.

“We’ll see who breaks whom,” Guan Yu spat, smashing the phone.

Wei soon reported Zhang’s car at Royal Garden Hotel. Guan Yu ordered: “Expose all Zhang’s scandals—his embezzlement, affair with Xie Yulu—especially to his wife.”

Meanwhile, Zhang, having drugged Pan Xiaoxia at breakfast, watched his hired cultivators carry her unconscious form to his presidential suite. Swallowing potency pills, he leered at her bound figure.

“Release me, and I’ll agree to anything else,” Pan pleaded weakly, her cultivation suppressed by the drugs.

“After all this effort?” Zhang sneered, unbuttoning her blouse. “I’ll make you scream in—”

Bursting into the hotel, Guan Yu and Hou threatened receptionists at gunpoint for the room number. Confronting Zhang’s guards outside 1508, Guan Yu faced the hired muscle.

“You’re Guan Yu?” a guard challenged.

The final showdown began.
