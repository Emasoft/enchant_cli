**Chapter 4457: Endless Dawdling**

No sooner said than done. Struggling to stand once more despite the searing pain in his feet, Lin Chen fixed his gaze on an arm-thick branch of the willow tree. If he could break it off, everything would fall into place.

Yet without tools, the task seemed nearly impossible. Finally, he threw his quilt to the ground, braced his feet against the earth—tears welling anew from the agony—and leaped up to grip the branch. Using his full weight, he yanked downward.

The pain was unbearable. Tears streaked Lin Chen’s face, but he clenched his jaw. This branch might be his only hope of returning to Camel Town.

Face wet with tears, he finally snapped the dead branch free—a stroke of luck, for a live one would have defied his strength. Testing its length, he found it suitable. After hobbling a few steps, he gathered dry grass, twisted it into rope, and used it to tie the quilt to his back. Freed from carrying it, movement became slightly easier.

As dawn broke, Guan Yu rose and immediately checked if Lin Chen had returned. Ling Su, who had spent the night scheming and praying for Lin Chen’s demise, feigned concern.

“Has Lin Chen not returned? I haven’t seen him,” Ling Su asked, masking his glee.

“No,” Guan Yu replied. “I’ve searched everywhere. His room remains untouched. It seems he never came back.” He sighed. “That troublemaker…”

Ling Su exhaled in relief, his mood brightening. “What a fine day! What’s our plan? Shall we send someone back to the sect for funds?”

“Let’s wait,” Guan Yu said. “First, arrange breakfast. Afterward, I’ll visit the dumpling shop to investigate.”

Regardless of Lin Chen’s fate, Guan Yu felt obligated to inquire—if only to justify their actions to Elder Xuanming upon their return.

At breakfast, Ling Su regaled everyone with Lin Chen’s misadventures, embellishing each retelling. Not content, he cornered Siqi.

“Siqi, have you heard about Lin Chen?”

“Yes,” she replied. “But where is he now?”

“Who knows? Probably dead,” Ling Su sneered. “Last night, I followed him to a tavern called Sister Mei’s. He changed into blue robes and met that tall beauty from the dumpling shop. Can you believe it? That runt charming such a woman? I eavesdropped outside.

“She brought him ‘precious rose wine’—poisoned, no doubt. After drinking, he collapsed. When I burst in, he lay like a corpse, stripped of silver and jade. The woman vanished. I left him there—no use dragging a dead man through the cold.”

Ling Su’s tale crescendoed with Lin Chen’s “lifeless” state, relishing the imagined tragedy.

Wang Jun remarked, “How… diligent of you to stalk him.”

“He looked suspicious in new clothes!” Ling Su defended.

Aze, ever righteous, chided, “You left him poisoned?”

“It was risky!” Ling Su shot back. “I’d have been caught too!”

Guan Yu addressed the group: “Our plans change again. I regret entrusting funds to Lin Chen. Still, as our senior brother, we must seek him—dead or alive. Rest today. I’ll investigate.”

His words were dutiful, though he privately doubted success. The dumpling shop’s schemers would leave no evidence.

“We depart tomorrow,” Guan Yu declared. “The desert requires little silver. I’ll cover expenses. Rest assured.”

As the group dispersed, Siqi offered to accompany him, but Guan Yu refused. “Aze, Wang Jun—come with me.”

**Chapter 4458: Finally Returned**

As they prepared to leave, a figure appeared at the inn’s entrance—a “beggar” clad in a floral-patterned quilt, twigs in disheveled hair, leaning on a staff, one foot swollen grotesquely.

“Lin Chen? You’re alive?!” Ling Su blurted, torn between disappointment and laughter at the absurd sight.

The room erupted in stifled giggles. Guan Yu surveyed Lin Chen’s state: frostbitten, filthy, one foot mangled—a tapestry of snakebites, mud, and blood.

“What happened?” Guan Yu asked, though the answer was evident.

Lin Chen collapsed, unconscious.

“Carry him in,” Guan Yu ordered. “He’s lucky to be alive.”

---

Examining Lin Chen’s wounds—a septic foot, lacerations filled with debris—Guan Yu deduced a harrowing night. “He crawled from a grave,” he muttered, eyeing the quilt strapped with grass ropes.

Ling Su scoffed, “Iron-willed to survive this. Vengeance must fuel him.”

“Let him rest,” Guan Yu said. “We proceed tomorrow if he doesn’t wake.”

Ling Su prayed for exactly that.

**Chapter 4459: In Need of Assistance**

By noon, Lin Chen stirred, croaking for water. The crowd gathered, their amusement thinly veiled.

“Seems I’ve cheated death,” Lin Chen rasped, tear-tracks cleaving the grime on his face.

Wang Jun smirked. “Cried hard, didn’t you? Muddy tears and all.”

Lin Chen’s face crumpled.

Guan Yu cut in: “Where did you return from?”

“A graveyard,” Lin Chen groaned. “A night in hell.”

“Spare the drama,” Wang Jun said. “We know about the woman. Where’s the silver?”

Ling Su leaned in. “We saw you at Sister Mei’s. Admit it.”

Lin Chen glanced at Siqi, defeated.

Guan Yu coldly stated, “You have two days: retrieve the silver or return to Yunqing Sect for more.”

“I need your help,” Lin Chen pleaded. “That witch robbed me. Help me reclaim it!”

---

The room buzzed with disdain. No one moved. Lin Chen’s fate—like his swollen foot—hung in the balance.
