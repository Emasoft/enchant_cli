Guan Yu crouched down and discovered the torch still retained residual warmth upon closer inspection. His eyes widened in surprise—this clearly marked a recently extinguished torch, its heat lingering like a fading breath.

This meant the faint glimmer he'd glimpsed from the mountainside earlier had indeed been this very torch. Its presence proved someone had been here. Yet despite his heightened vigilance during the ascent, Guan Yu had detected no signs of anyone descending.

The torch's warmth contradicted the absence of its user—a puzzling inconsistency. As Guan Yu lifted the torch, another anomaly caught his eye: the thick dust blanketing the ground bore chaotic imprints of scattered footprints. Beside the altar, faint indentations suggested someone had recently sat there.

The stone platform, rising over a meter high, supported a three-meter-tall Buddha statue. Guan Yu now knelt before this platform, his gaze sharpening as he noticed a fan-shaped pattern in the dust—a trail stretching from the platform's base outward.

“There’s a secret passage here!” he realized, heart quickening.

The arc-shaped marks unmistakably indicated a sliding door’s friction against the floor, sweeping dust aside. With no other objects nearby, the stone platform itself must conceal a hidden entrance.

His mind raced: *This place is ingeniously concealed. Without meticulous scrutiny, no one would suspect a thing.* Whether the passage led to tunnels or a cellar remained unclear, but Guan Yu felt certain—nine chances out of ten—that Jiang Xin had been taken inside.

Though tempted to storm in and overpower the kidnappers, caution stayed his hand. While confident in his ability to rescue Jiang Xin, acting rashly might jeopardize the larger scheme.

*If I save her now, the credit goes to the Great Prince and Prince Zou. But without concrete evidence implicating the Cao family, our efforts would be wasted.* Torturing confessions from captives posed risks—what if they refused to talk?

After weighing options, Guan Yu decided to wait. *Jiang Xin is likely safe for now. Let Prince Zou station men nearby. When the Cao family arrives to rendezvous, we’ll ambush them. By then, even if Old Master Cao grows a hundred mouths, he’ll never talk his way out. The Cao name will be erased from the capital.*

Guan Yu gambled on Cao Di’s impatience. *That lecherous fool dreams of possessing Jiang Xin. With this “opportunity” dropped in his lap, he’ll come running.*

Leaving undetected, Guan Yu hurried back. Dawn tinged the eastern sky as he reached the capital gates. Though curfew had lifted, throngs crowded the entrance—merchants and travelers queued for inspection.

With no time for lines, Guan Yu vaulted over the wall at a quieter section. Lacking subordinates here, he sought the Great Prince, finding him still vigilantly guarding the gates despite a sleepless night.

“Your Highness,” Guan Yu called softly from the shadows. “Where’s Prince Zou? I’ve found a suspicious location requiring discreet surveillance.”

The Great Prince handed over a jade token. “This grants access to his residence. Go swiftly.”

At Prince Zou’s estate, Guan Yu outlined the plan. The prince immediately dispatched his trusted aide Zou Wuhui with elite guards to covertly surround the mountain temple.

“Your insight astonishes me,” Prince Zou remarked. “Most would rush to rescue the hostage, yet you strategize to lure the snake from its hole.”

“Cao’s family will make contact today,” Guan Yu replied calmly. “They won’t restrain themselves.”

Meanwhile, Cao Manor maintained deceptive calm. At daybreak, a panicked servant reported: “Young Master! Our tavern was ransacked—by the Qin family!”

Cao Di scoffed. “Impossible! Our alliance with Qin is solid. Imposters, surely.”

But the servant insisted: “Young Master Qin Huan himself led them!”

Unconcerned with domestic affairs, Cao Di focused on his prize. Disguised in shabby clothes and an ostentatious black cloak, he mounted a prized steed—an incongruous sight that drew stares.

Red Shadow operatives trailing him soon lost track in the chaotic northern gate crowds. Cao Di, impatient, shoved through the queue.

“Wait your turn!” a merchant protested, grabbing his cloak.

Cao Di ripped off the hood. “You dare hinder *me*? The Cao name needs no queues!”

Recognition sparked fear. The crowd parted like reeds before him. Bribing a guard with gold, Cao Di galloped toward the mountains—unaware of watchers tracking his every move.

In the palace, Prince Zou found the Emperor and Princess Consort haggard from sleepless worry. “We’ve set the trap,” he assured them. “The Cao family’s downfall is imminent.”

As dawn’s light hardened into day, the chess pieces moved toward checkmate.
