“Second Only to Wolf nodded in understanding. His tasks were to stake out the pawnshop and probe a man named Qi Zhi—simple enough. ‘Alright, leave this to me. I’ll head back to keep playing now. Bye!’

He hurriedly moved to exit the car, eager to return to gambling—his true passion. But just as he stepped out, Xue Jing stopped him.

‘Brother Jinci,’ she said earnestly, ‘you’ve already agreed to my request. We must act now. Every minute risks missing someone connected to Old Wu. You need to stake out the pawnshop immediately.’

Second Only to Wolf froze. ‘Huh? Now? But I still have…’

Guan Yu cut him off with a chuckle. ‘I’ll have your game coins secured. Don’t worry—the whole world might know, but Sakurako won’t. As for those two women, you can find them later. Or do you plan to spy while cuddling them?’

Reluctantly, Second Only to Wolf conceded. Xue Jing’s logic was sound. ‘Fine. I’ll head to the pawnshop now. Make sure my coins are locked tight—I had over a hundred thousand points! Later!’

Before Guan Yu could protest, Second Only to Wolf vanished—his speed unmatched.

Guan Yu grimaced at Xue Jing. Their plan had progressed smoothly until this last-minute extortion. Earlier, Second Only to Wolf had only thirty thousand points, yet now he’d inflated it to a hundred thousand—a blatant seventy-thousand-point swindle. If those women lost more, Guan Yu’s losses would deepen.

Deciding to handle it later, Guan Yu returned to the casino’s second floor with Xue Jing, only to find the women gone and Second Only to Wolf’s machine occupied by strangers. The points had plummeted to a mere hundred.

‘Where are the women who were here?’ Guan Yu growled, grabbing a bystander.

‘Who are you? We haven’t seen anyone!’ the man stammered, genuine fear in his eyes.

Rushing downstairs, Guan Yu demanded answers at the counter. ‘Two women in short skirts—did they leave?’

Blushing, a staffer replied, ‘Yes… They exchanged their coins and left.’

‘How? Those coins weren’t theirs!’ Guan Yu snapped. The casino’s strict protocols required real-name registration and matching bank transfers.

‘One lady registered her own account,’ the staffer explained. ‘She claimed the points were her winnings, so we processed the exchange.’

Guan Yu cursed under his breath. The women had exploited Second Only to Wolf’s absence. ‘I need their details—names, anything!’

‘We can’t disclose customer privacy,’ the staffer apologized.

Defeated, Guan Yu left. On the road, Xue Jing asked, ‘Should we inform Brother Jinci?’

‘No. He’s crucial for surveilling Golden Prosperity Pawnshop. If he learns his coins are gone, he’ll throw a fit. Let him focus. When he eventually finds out, the records will prove it wasn’t my fault.’

‘Where to now?’ Xue Jing asked.

‘What’s this “surprise” you mentioned?’

‘Wei Hongwei is fetching it to Yu Gang’s base. You’ll see.’

Meanwhile, Bill Lin and Poison Widow convened with Young Master Feng.

‘My Dark Sun faction has regrouped with a hundred men,’ Poison Widow reported. ‘We’ll infiltrate Yu Gang’s territories and stir chaos to distract Guan Yu.’

Bill Lin nodded. ‘Good. But we need funds to secure their loyalty.’

Poison Widow seized the opening. ‘There’s another task. Guan Yu has a “sister” at Kihuang Academy—Qu Shuangshuang. Kidnap her, and we’ll gain leverage.’

Young Master Feng interjected, ‘Fool! She’s no ordinary girl. Her admirers would drown you in spit before Guan Yu lifts a finger.’

Qu Shuangshuang, the ‘Goddess of Kindness and Most Beautiful Campus Belle,’ had become a sensation. Her charm, intellect, and fierce sense of justice earned her legions of followers. When a director sought to cast her, Guan Yu vetoed it—prioritizing her studies.

Bill Lin scowled, jealousy burning. ‘I’ll have her, money or not!’

‘Touch her,’ Young Master Feng warned, ‘and you’ll regret it.’

**Chapter 2851: Recruiting Followers**

Qu Shuangshuang’s reputation soared. After intervening in a lover’s spat, her admirers thrived. Campus conflicts dwindled as students sought her mediation. Her humility and warmth, coupled with Guan Yu’s backing, made her untouchable.

When social media fame brought movie offers, Guan Yu refused. ‘Focus on your studies,’ he insisted. Yet her online following ballooned to over a hundred thousand—devotees who adored her candid posts and photos.

Bill Lin, obsessed with her beauty, plotted recklessly. Young Master Feng’s caution fell on deaf ears. To Bill Lin, Qu Shuangshuang symbolized yet another prize Guan Yu didn’t deserve.

**Chapter 2852: The Admirers**

Qu Shuangshuang’s legend grew. A campus predator, thwarted by her defenders, cemented her status. Students flocked to her, saving her contacts with photos to remember names. Her phone buzzed nonstop—fan messages, pleas for help, even marriage proposals.

Directors courted her, but Guan Yu barred the path. ‘No娱乐圈 for you,’ he decreed. To him, her safety and education trumped fleeting fame.

Bill Lin’s fixation deepened. Staring at her photo, he cursed fate. ‘Why does Guan Yu get everything?’ he seethed, blind to the storm his envy would unleash.
