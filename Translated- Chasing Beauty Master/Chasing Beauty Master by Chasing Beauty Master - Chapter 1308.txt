Wang Xiaorong nodded and said, “That’s right. After Black Blood Ridge established this poplar forest, it has existed for nearly a century. Given its long development, you can imagine how formidable this place is. Ordinary people who enter would struggle even to leave, let alone venture deeper.”

“Moreover,” Wang Xiaorong continued as they walked, “Black Blood Ridge has always enforced strict rules. Disciples from outside factions aren’t permitted into its main stronghold—they only gather intelligence externally. Even within the stronghold, only a few leaders know the secret passages. Lower-ranking disciples are blindfolded and escorted by designated leaders when entering or exiting.”

She added, “I’ve captured members of Black Blood Ridge before and interrogated them harshly, but they revealed nothing. To learn the shortcuts leading to their stronghold, we must capture someone at the leader level.”

“So stringent?” Guanyu remarked. “This Blood Lord of Black Blood Ridge is quite cunning. If nothing else, this poplar forest alone makes it impossible for enemies to breach, ensuring the stronghold’s isolation and safety. It’s practically an impenetrable sanctuary.”

Wang Xiaorong scoffed. “The situation here isn’t as dire as you think. These are merely pre-set spells. Intruders trigger them under specific conditions, trapping themselves. If you know how the spells activate, you can pass through unharmed.”

“But it can’t be that simple,” Guanyu countered. “As you said, many have died here without understanding the triggers. I suspect these spells are everywhere, activated indiscriminately by anyone passing through.”

Guanyu inwardly admired the Blood Lord’s ingenuity. Creating such a formidable forest as a barrier to Black Blood Ridge meant even an army would struggle to penetrate it. The poplars ranged from arm-thick to wider than a human waist—clearing them would demand immense manpower and time.

In a modern city, Guanyu mused, hiring hundreds of bulldozers and excavators could flatten the forest swiftly. But here, lacking such tools, the task seemed insurmountable.

As Guanyu lost himself in thought, Second-to-Wolf grumbled, “How much longer? I’m exhausted. Can we rest?”

Wang Xiaorong halted, shooting him an exasperated look. “I warned you not to overdrink my wine. You thought your tolerance was high? That Serpent King Wine is brewed to be several times stronger than ordinary liquor. No wonder you can’t walk straight now—feeling dizzy?”

**Chapter 3372: The Overpowering Wine**

Second-to-Wolf grimaced. “It didn’t seem strong when I drank it! Who knew the aftereffect would hit so hard? My whole body’s burning, and my head’s foggy.”

“Guanyu,” Wang Xiaorong said, “your friend’s delay isn’t my fault. He should sit and meditate to disperse the alcohol. Let’s rest here before moving on.”

The group agreed. Second-to-Wolf sat cross-legged, focusing on regulating his breathing to expel the wine’s potency.

“Drink more water—it’ll help,” Wang Xiaorong advised, tossing him a waterskin.

Second-to-Wolf gulped eagerly. “Why didn’t you say so earlier? I’m boiling alive!”

Wang Xiaorong’s Serpent King Wine, brewed with rare herbs and a millennium-old king cobra, had a deceptively mild taste but overwhelming aftereffects. Excessive consumption induced a fiery, prolonged heat in the body, though it also purged toxins. Crafted by the Demon Lord of the Soul Demon Sect, the wine was precious—yet Second-to-Wolf had nearly drained the gourd.

As the group rested, Xiao Zhi approached Guanyu. “Was coming here reckless?”

“Scared?” Guanyu retorted.

“Not with you all here,” Xiao Zhi said. “But it’s pitch-black. Wouldn’t daytime be safer? Even if we couldn’t enter Black Blood Ridge then, at least we’d see the path through this forest.”

“We’re here to rescue Xiaotong,” Guanyu replied. “Focus on that.”

A sudden buzzing interrupted them. “Whoa! Enormous mosquitoes!” Aze exclaimed, swatting a five-centimeter-long, iridescent insect. “A bite from these would poison you!”

Wang Xiaorong’s eyes widened. “Light the fire starters! Now!”

The group ignited their fire starters, illuminating swarms of colossal, multicolored mosquitoes clinging motionless to poplars. Without the light, the insects would have been invisible.

“Carry him,” Wang Xiaorong ordered, gesturing to Second-to-Wolf, still meditating. “Stay in the center. The light repels them—if it dies, one bite could kill you.”

Guanyu sighed—Second-to-Wolf had become a burden. He hoisted the man onto his back, following Wang Xiaorong through the mosquito-infested darkness.

The firelight terrified the insects, sending them scuttling or dropping dead when scorched.

“You’re brilliant, Wang Xiaorong!” Xiao Zhi praised.

“Quiet!” she snapped. “Dangers lurk everywhere. I won’t have any of you dying here.”

Xiao Zhi smirked. “Didn’t realize you cared.”

“I don’t,” she retorted. “But your deaths would tarnish my reputation.”

The others understood her prickly demeanor. Risking her life to aid them deserved gratitude, regardless of her motives.

**Chapter 3373: Life and Death at Stake**

As their fire starters dimmed, the group distanced themselves from the mosquitoes. “Extinguish them properly,” Wang Xiaorong warned. “A forest fire would bury us here.”

Ahead, moonlight peeked through thinning trees. “The exit!” Wang Xiaorong confirmed, checking her compass. “We’re close.”

Relief washed over them. The sparse poplars here were waist-thick, spaced widely.

“Why so few trees?” Guanyu wondered. “Poor soil? Or does the Blood Lord assume few reach this far?”

“Enough chatter,” Wang Xiaorong urged. “Keep moving.”

The path worsened—thick layers of rotting leaves sank underfoot, reeking of decay.

“Ah!” Wang Xiaorong screamed as the ground collapsed beneath her.

Guanyu lunged, grabbing her wrist as a forty-square-meter chasm swallowed trees whole. Dangling over the abyss, their group formed a human chain: Aze clung to a tree, gripping Xiao Zhi’s leg; Xiao Zhi held Guanyu’s arm, who clutched Wang Xiaorong.

Nearby, a waist-thick poplar creaked, tilting toward them.

“Let go!” Wang Xiaorong pleaded. “Or we’ll all die!”

“Stop fucking moving!” Guanyu roared. “No one dies today!”

His ferocity startled even Siqi, jolting her from shock.

Wang Xiaorong, reminded of a childhood cliffside rescue by her father, recalled his words: “Your death wouldn’t be yours alone.” She’d vowed never to endanger others—yet here she was, risking lives for Guanyu.

As the tree crashed toward them, Siqi screamed, “Guanyu!”

**Chapter 3375: Reaching the Destination**

“Nonsense,” Xiao Zhi later argued. “Digging such pits isn’t worth the effort. Better to set more spells.”

Wang Xiaorong studied the chasm. “This pit existed naturally. How many others like it, I can’t say.”

The group pressed on, the trials of the poplar forest behind them—but greater dangers awaited at Black Blood Ridge.
