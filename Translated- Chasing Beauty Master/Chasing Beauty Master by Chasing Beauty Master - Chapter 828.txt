“After a moment of thought, the proprietress said, ‘Ah, Guan Yu? There’s absolutely nothing between us, don’t misunderstand. He just comes here to eat. I can guarantee we’ve never had any kind of relationship.’”

“Hearing this, Feng Xihu couldn’t suppress a surge of inexplicable joy, her tense expression softening visibly. Noticing the change, the proprietress mentally patted herself on the back, knowing she’d struck the right chord.”

“Feng Xihu declared, ‘Since there’s no relationship, I hope you’ll keep it that way. If you agree, I’ll compensate you.’”

“The proprietress’s eyes lit up at the mention of payment. Though fully understanding Feng’s intentions, she feigned ignorance, asking coyly, ‘Compensation? What kind?’”

**Chapter 3020: Forced into a Corner**

“Observing Feng Xihu’s pleased reaction, the proprietress congratulated herself inwardly. Feng stated coolly, ‘Twenty thousand upfront if you swear to never associate with Guan Yu again.’”

“With theatrical flourish, Feng produced a check from her designer handbag. The proprietress’s eyes gleamed as she flashed a row of pearly teeth. Yet her gaze soon shifted cunningly. ‘Well...the situation with Guan Yu is rather complicated. Twenty thousand is tempting, but...’ She trailed off meaningfully, studying Feng’s face, aware of her wealthy background.”

“Recognizing the greed, Feng shrugged. ‘Name your price.’”

“‘Hmm...’ The proprietress pretended to agonize before blurting, ‘Two hundred thousand! That’ll ensure complete severance.’ Though balking inwardly, Feng maintained composure. Her family’s influence in City A was formidable—even local gang leader Hui Ge answered to the Fengs. Crushing this small-time restaurateur would be child’s play, but Feng Xihu hesitated. Her sadistic elder brother’s likely treatment of the attractive woman gave her pause.”

“‘Deal,’ Feng agreed tersely, producing a bank card since her checkbook only held the initial offer. The proprietress practically salivated, whipping out a card reader like a magician. As the transaction completed, she mentally cheered: Guan Yu’s my golden goose! I should frame his photo under my pillow!”

“After extracting multiple promises of abstinence, Feng departed. Two hundred thousand to eliminate a romantic rival seemed reasonable—she’d gladly pay millions to purge all women from Guan Yu’s orbit, but reality check: his companions were all independently wealthy.”

“Meanwhile, Guan Yu finally shook off Feng’s pursuers with Qing Ling’er in tow. One overzealous lackey earned a flying kick. ‘Why are we running?’ Qing Ling’er panted. ‘Are they enemies?’ She’d noticed the Porsche earlier but remained puzzled.”

“‘They’re not enemies—I just prefer avoiding them,’ Guan Yu deflected, dropping her at Pan Taisheng’s apartment. Though Feng’s car was gone, sentries still guarded his vehicle. After sneaking Qing Ling’er upstairs, Guan Yu realized retrieving his car meant confrontation. Resigned, he borrowed Pan’s truck.”

“When Pan later tried moving Guan Yu’s car into parking, Feng’s goons blocked him. Arriving in her Porsche, Feng inquired politely, ‘You know Guan Yu?’”

“‘What’s it to you?’ Pan retorted. ‘This is my car now!’”

“A henchman interjected, ‘We saw Guan Yu enter with a woman!’ Feng’s eyes narrowed. ‘Take me to him!’”

“Pan blocked their path. ‘It’s late! You’ll disturb my tenants!’ Upon learning he owned the building, Feng switched tactics: ‘I mean no harm—just want to talk.’”

“Pan revealed Guan Yu had left in his truck. When Feng demanded proof, he jingled car keys. Snatching them, Feng tested the remote. As the horn blared, she smirked, ‘Tell Guan Yu to find me if he wants his car back!’”

“Squealing tires punctuated her exit. Cursing, Pan called Guan Yu: ‘That Feng woman took your car! Left her Ferrari though—limited edition!’”

“‘No matter,’ Guan Yu sighed. ‘Thanks anyway.’”

“For days, Feng flaunted Guan Yu’s car at spas and salons. When Wei Hongwei spotted it outside a ladies’ bathhouse, he ribbed Guan Yu: ‘Since when do you get facials?’”

“‘That’s Feng Xihu’s doing!’ Guan Yu snapped. ‘Want to help? Retrieve my car instead of joking! Or should I tell Qian Yaoyao about your cafeteria adventures?’”

“Wei paled—his girlfriend stood beside him. ‘Explain!’ Yaoyao twisted his ear viciously. ‘Was it the school cafeteria’s “waitresses”?’”

“Howling, Wei blamed friend Jia Bo: ‘He dragged me! I’ve got you—why would I look elsewhere?’”

“Yaoyao released him with a warning: ‘Lie again, and I’ll neuter you!’”

“Rubbing his throbbing ear, Wei marveled at his survival—another close call in the perilous game of love.”

**Chapter 3022: True Bromance**

“The infamous ‘waitresses’ of Kaihuang Academy’s cafeteria had become upper-crust gossip. Wei’s ear still burned as Yaoyao demanded his phone. ‘I’m verifying with Jia Bo!’”

“Wei groaned inwardly—one ill-advised joke had backfired spectacularly. As Yaoyao dialed, he sent silent apologies to his scapegoat friend, praying their brotherhood would withstand this trial.”
