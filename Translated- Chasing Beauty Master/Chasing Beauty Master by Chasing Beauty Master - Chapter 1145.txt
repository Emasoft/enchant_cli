Xue Jing explained, “There are many leather factories, and even in City A alone, there are two. The other one is much larger. Even if this client wanted to switch leather processors, they wouldn’t come to us. Since we’ve just changed ownership and production isn’t fully stable yet, would you, as a client, bring your materials and pay a higher price to such a factory? Obviously not. But why would this client directly approach us to process such a massive volume of leather? That must be their intention.”

Guan Yu shared Xue Jing’s suspicions, but for now, he couldn’t discern any ulterior motives. Between a producer and a client, signing a contract and ensuring quality control with an acceptable defect rate should be straightforward. The rest shouldn’t pose major issues.

After pondering, Guan Yu still couldn’t pinpoint what felt off. Opening the file folder on his desk, he found two names inside: Zhao Jibo and Li Gaozhao. These were presumably the clients’ names. Though unremarkable, Guan Yu was certain he’d never encountered them before—such ordinary names were easy to forget.

Unbeknownst to him, these names were entirely fabricated by Lai Huangsi’s group to hide their identities. They feared Guan Yu might investigate their backgrounds and discover their prior affiliation with the Feng family’s business dealings, which would expose their ruse.

Guan Yu reviewed the file’s introduction, which stated that Zhao Jibo and Li Gaozhao had been in the leather trade for years. The document also listed their previous collaborations with other leather factories, including detailed records. It mentioned their current order for 5,000 tons of processed leather—a volume too large for their previous factory, hence their search for a new partner, leading them to Guan Yu.

Logically, Guan Yu should have been thrilled to secure a client, yet he felt uneasy. It wasn’t just the peculiar circumstances—there was an indescribable foreboding.

As Guan Yu flipped through the documents, he stumbled upon the contract Lan Ting had signed with the clients. The clauses highlighted penalties for delays: twentyfold compensation for every breach. Such terms were utterly unreasonable.

Normally, if a client demanded excessive terms, a producer could negotiate extensions or reduced output. Even in worst-case scenarios, penalties rarely exceeded threefold. Yet this contract was riddled with one-sided clauses, none favoring the factory. Guan Yu began questioning Lan Ting’s competence—how could she sign such a deal? It practically invited disaster.

With twentyfold penalties, the factory could be bankrupted overnight. Guan Yu realized the trap lay in the contract itself. Whether the order was 500 or 5,000 tons, it was all a smokescreen. The current “small” order—requiring ten days of round-the-clock production—was designed to force them into missing deadlines or exceeding defect rates, triggering massive payouts. This was their true aim.

As Guan Yu mulled this over, Lan Ting returned with two cups of water, setting them before Guan Yu and Xue Jing. “Have some water,” she said cheerfully. “Let’s discuss this slowly.”

“Did you read this contract?” Guan Yu demanded.

“Of course,” Lan Ting replied. “I signed it, didn’t I? I wouldn’t sign without reviewing.”

“Did you actually see the penalty clauses? Twentyfold compensation for everything?”

“I read it multiple times,” she insisted. “You’re concerned about the penalties, right?”

“Exactly. How could you agree to such outrageous terms?”

“They said those penalties were just motivational—to ensure we prioritize their order. They’re in a hurry. Minor delays wouldn’t trigger full penalties.” Lan Ting spoke as if parroting the clients’ assurances, perhaps brainwashed.

Guan Yu frowned. “Verbal promises mean nothing. This is a legally binding document! If they nitpick during delivery, we’d lose everything we’ve earned. This order seems small, but the risks are enormous.”

Lan Ting remained optimistic. “If we deliver on time and quality, they’ll have no grounds for complaints. We just need strict quality checks.”

Though her logic held, Guan Yu’s unease persisted. Lan Ting added, “I accepted their terms for the factory’s sake. Landing such a client is rare. Yes, the terms are steep, but with diligence, we can manage.”

Guan Yu nodded reluctantly. “You’re not wrong. I’d have taken the deal too—the price is higher than market rate. But did you verify their credentials?”

“Thoroughly. They’ve been in leather for years. Previous factories confirmed their reliability and prompt payments.”

**Chapter 2,930: Investigating Thoroughly**

Despite Lan Ting’s confidence, Guan Yu remained wary. “After this order, they promised larger contracts, correct?”

“Yes,” Lan Ting beamed. “This is just a trial. If satisfied, they’ll place bigger orders.”

“Give me copies of their documents. I’ll have them investigated.” Guan Yu turned to Xue Jing. “We’ll send the details to Huayu Group. They’ll uncover any falsifications.”

As Lan Ting left to make copies, Xue Jing asked, “Do you really suspect foul play?”

“Better safe than ruined,” Guan Yu replied. After collecting the documents, he instructed Lan Ting, “Don’t sign any future contracts without my approval.”

Next, Guan Yu sought Wang Hu. “Install surveillance cameras across the factory—especially corridors and warehouses. Have Wei Hongwei arrange workers immediately.”

When Wei Hongwei answered his phone amidst background chatter, Guan Yu barked, “Find a quiet spot!” Once the noise faded, he ordered, “Get surveillance crews to the leather factory now. Finish by tonight.”

Wei Hongwei’s eyes lit up at the profitable task. Abandoning his lavish celebratory meal for Jia Bo, he rushed out, dragging his girlfriend Qian Yaoyao along. “Emergency job!” he told the disappointed revelers. “We’ll feast another day!”

**Chapter 2,931: Reconvening Later**

“Prioritize the cameras,” Guan Yu stressed. “Cover all blind spots.”

“Consider it done!” Wei Hongwei assured, already calculating kickbacks from the equipment purchases. As he hurried off, Jia Bo called after him, “You owe me a feast!”

“Stuff yourself with the leftovers!” Wei Hongwei shot back, visions of profit overriding his appetite. The race against time began—to unmask the clients’ scheme before the factory paid the price.
