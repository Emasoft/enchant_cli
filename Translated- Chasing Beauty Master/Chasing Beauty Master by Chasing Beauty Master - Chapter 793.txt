Hou Jinshun maintained a polite demeanor as he said, “Young master, we don’t engage in that sort of business here. If your master wishes to seek such services, please look elsewhere.”

The young man’s pupils abruptly constricted. “Nonsense!” he spat angrily. “If we were willing to go elsewhere, would we still be here? If you don’t have what we need, go find a few! My master isn’t leaving today.”

Though his words carried fury, his youthful voice lent an oddly incongruous tone to the threat.

“My apologies, young master,” Hou Jinshun replied evenly, already bracing for an attack as he subtly circulated his internal energy. “As I said, we do not conduct such business here. You must leave.”

“You people are beyond redemption. Useless to the world,” the young man hissed, stepping forward to strike. But a hand suddenly seized his arm, halting his advance.

The hand belonged to the drunkard seated beside him. The man slurred drowsily, “Disciple… let it go. We’ll leave.”

“Master?” The youth frowned in confusion but obediently helped the drunkard rise.

“There’s an expert present today,” the drunkard muttered. “We shouldn’t provoke trouble. Our mission matters more. Let’s go.”

As the pair turned to leave, Hou Jinshun blocked their path. “Wait. You’ve injured two of our security guards. They’re severely wounded—you can’t simply walk away.”

A cold glint flashed in the drunkard’s eyes as he sized up Hou Jinshun, but his gaze flickered toward Guanyu before the hostility faded. “What do you propose?”

Hou Jinshun noted the momentary shift, realizing the man’s intoxication had been an act—their entire visit was a calculated provocation. Sensing danger, Guanyu approached. “Assault demands legal consequences. I’ve already called the police. You’ll await their arrival.”

“Enough!” The young disciple snarled. “We’ve shown restraint, yet you overstep! What’s so grand about summoning police? Let me tell you—”

The drunkard raised a hand, silencing him. With a dry cough, he said, “This trifle needn’t escalate. A few officers couldn’t detain me if they tried, but I’ve no desire for bloodshed. My disciple injured your men—we’ll compensate.”

Reluctantly accepting the offer, Hou Jinshun calculated, “Two severely wounded guards require 20,000 each. Including the earlier head injury—50,000 total.”

To Guanyu’s surprise, the drunkard showed no reaction to the sum. “Disciple, pay them,” he ordered calmly.

The youth produced stacks of cash from his satchel, drawing shocked murmurs from onlookers. Such wealth from a disheveled drunk!

After accepting payment, Hou Jinshun bid a stiff farewell. The disciple shot him a murderous glare before escorting his master out of Huaye.

Guanyu tailed them discreetly. The pair hailed a taxi heading northward, eventually stopping at a roadside motel frequented by long-haul drivers. Instead of entering, they vanished down a forest path.

As Guanyu prepared to follow, two cars screeched to a halt. Six armed men rushed into the woods—robbers drawn by the earlier display of wealth. Signaling Hou Jinshun to follow, Guanyu crept into the darkness.

“Why would wealthy men come here?” Hou Jinshun whispered as they navigated the shadowed trees.

“No idea,” Guanyu murmured. “But they’re clearly abnormal.”

A voice suddenly cut through the night: “Hand over the bag, and we might let you live!”

Peering from behind a tree, they witnessed six thugs encircling the master and disciple. The robbers’ greed overlooked one crucial detail—the disciple’s earlier demonstration of lethal skill.

The master sighed. “We’ve already compensated you at the bar. Leave now—I dislike disturbances here.”

Guanyu frowned. This docility contradicted the drunkard’s earlier violence. Unbeknownst to him, the master had sensed Guanyu’s formidable energy at Huaye and chosen caution.

The disciple brandished a twenty-centimeter silver needle—his true weapon, mistaken earlier for a knife. At his master’s nod, he moved like lightning. Screams erupted as blades clattered to the ground.

“Enough!” the master commanded as the thugs fled. Then, raising his voice, “Show yourselves.”

Before Guanyu could react, three figures emerged opposite them—Li Yuan, an obese man (Ma Hai), and a garishly made-up woman.

Ma Hai approached, holding a bloody parcel. “As agreed, Master Wu—an eight-year king cobra’s gallbladder.”

Inspecting the glowing green organ under flashlight, Master Wu nodded. “It suffices.”

“Then when will you deal with Guanyu?” Ma Hai pressed.

“Tomorrow. Give me his address.”

Guanyu’s blood ran cold. The transaction became clear—snake gallbladders traded for assassination. But Ma Hai amended, “First, eliminate Wei Hongwei. We’ll dismantle Guanyu’s circle step by step.”

Master Wu’s eyes narrowed. “One favor was our agreement.”

“Stay longer,” Ma Hai coaxed. “Another gallbladder will cure your disciple. Then handle Guanyu.”

As the negotiation continued, Guanyu understood—this poisoned master needed toxic remedies, his disciple a collateral victim. Now pawns in Ma Hai’s vendetta, their lethal partnership threatened everyone in Guanyu’s orbit.

The forest shadows deepened, concealing predators human and reptilian, all coiled to strike.
