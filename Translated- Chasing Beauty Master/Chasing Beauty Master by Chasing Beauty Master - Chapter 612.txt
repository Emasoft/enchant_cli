As Guan Yu hesitated, she failed to notice the Soul-Devouring Whip undergoing subtle changes. The once-sharp hooks had vanished without a trace, leaving the whip appearing ordinary except for its fiery crimson hue. Sensing the transformation through her touch, she froze in astonishment. After a brief moment of shock, a faint smirk curled her lips as she gripped the weapon and strode forward.

Instead of bustling streets, Guan Yu encountered a lawless battlefield drenched in carnage – the true face of Demon City. Though merely ten years old, her nation-toppling beauty immediately drew the attention of humanoid demons inhabiting this realm. Their greedy gazes fell upon the underdeveloped yet strikingly beautiful girl, igniting both lustful desires among male demons and bitter jealousy among females.

Unaware of the commotion she caused, Guan Yu walked forward indifferently under the demons' lecherous stares. "Haha! What spirit! She's mine!" A bald demon drooled obscenely, wiping saliva from his chin. "Such exquisite features! I wonder how she'd taste..."

"Bet she'd feel amazing in bed!" The demons' vulgar comments flowed freely, yet Guan Yu maintained her icy composure.

A sultry voice suddenly cut through the noise. "No matter her beauty, she's still human – destined to become our meal!" The crowd turned to see an alluring woman with exposed midriff and dangerously skimpy attire standing nearby. Her violet hair cascaded over bare shoulders, while her revealing outfit accentuated voluptuous curves that threatened to burst through the fabric. Seductive eyes completed the image of lethal charm.

Guan Yu walked past without sparing her a glance, igniting the woman's fury. No one – man or woman – dared ignore Lady Wu Yuying. The demons bowed respectfully as she approached, their voices trembling with reverence: "Lady Wu Yuying!"

Wu Yuying extended a hand toward Guan Yu with feigned sweetness. "Greetings, human. I'm Wu Yuying, your guardian for today."

"Guardian?" Guan Yu raised an eyebrow.

"For novices entering Demon City's inner circle, a Saint-level guardian is assigned," Wu Yuying explained with poorly concealed arrogance. "You're fortunate it's me."

"Inner circle?" Guan Yu frowned. Having dwelled in the outer districts, this new hierarchy confused her.

"Ha! This is the Middle District – only Saints may enter." Wu Yuying preened until realizing Guan Yu had already walked away. "Stop right there!" she shrieked, fists clenched.

When Guan Yu paused, the demoness sneered, "Enjoy your final day! Humans always become food!" She licked her lips provocatively, eliciting nosebleeds from onlookers.

But Wu Yuying gravely underestimated her target. Though the Death Abyss's magic veil hid power levels, Guan Yu's presence here proved her Earth-level strength – the minimum requirement for entry. Moreover, the girl possessed monstrous combat skills allowing her to challenge even Saints.

Assuming Guan Yu had sneaked in through luck, Wu Yuying fell victim to her own vanity. Guan Yu responded with mock innocence: "Auntie, I need no protection. Should we fight, I couldn't bear hurting your elderly frame." The crowd stifled laughter at this insult to the voluptuous demoness.

Wu Yuying's eyes blazed with humiliation. "You'll pay for this, vermin!" she spat before vanishing. Guan Yu's smirk faded into vigilance – her real challenge lay ahead.

Turning to surrounding demons, Guan Yu adopted a polite tone: "I'm new here. Please advise me." While some reciprocated courtesy, a red-haired axe-wielder shoved forward. "Don't lump us with human trash!"

Cold fury flashed in Guan Yu's eyes. In a blur of motion, her whip lashed out – decapitating the challenger before he blinked. The crowd gasped at the Earth-level demon's instant demise.

"Call me Asura," Guan Yu declared, hovering mid-air with crimson whip coiled. "I'll entertain any challengers." Her display earned begrudging respect in this strength-worshipping realm.

A square-jawed demon named Iron Ta'er offered lodging. As Guan Yu accepted, lecherous demons lunged at her. She evaded effortlessly before unleashing a blood pool that dissolved the attackers into bones. Witnesses paled – this human fought more viciously than any demon.

Following Iron Ta'er, Guan Yu noted multiple ambush points. When challenged about their past encounter, she struck first. "Crimson Moon and Bloodied Clouds!" she cried. The whip danced autonomously, slaughtering hidden assailants as Guan Yu unleashed wind blades and earth shields in rapid succession.

Overwhelmed by her multi-elemental onslaught, Iron Ta'er roared in frustration as Guan Yu escaped. "I'll tear you limb from limb!" he bellowed – unaware of his impending doom.

From shadows, an observer named Ming watched in awe. This ten-year-old strategist with terrifying potential had become Demon City's wildcard – a human more ruthless than its native inhabitants. The stage was set for carnage as Guan Yu's eyes glowed with vengeance for her fallen master.
