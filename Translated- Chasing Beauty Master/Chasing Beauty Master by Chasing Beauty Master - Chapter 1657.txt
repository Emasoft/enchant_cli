Guan Yu never expected Wang Xiaorong to show such profound understanding. He stood up and said, "Xiaorong, thank you for your comprehension. You're a good girl. As for Qiqi—since this has happened, even unintentionally, I'll take responsibility. If you're willing, you can remain my disciple...or share the same status as Xiaorong."

"For now, I may not be able to offer you formal positions. I hope you can wait." Guan Yu concluded.

"Absolutely not!" Wang Xiaorong raised her voice. "Even if we're both your women, there must be order of precedence! I'm the first wife!" Her stance made clear she'd tolerate no compromise.

Surprised by Wang Xiaorong's reasonableness, Guan Yu readily conceded. "Very well. You'll be the first, Qiqi the second. Satisfied?"

"That's more like it. From now on, I'm senior and Qiqi junior before others." Wang Xiaorong added sternly, "Though men having multiple wives is normal, now that you've chosen me, no more recklessness. Understood?"

Though her blanket had been pulled aside, Qiqi remained motionless with closed eyes—too embarrassed to speak, uncertain what to say.

Wang Xiaorong addressed her gently: "Qiqi, I'm not establishing hierarchy between us. This is merely a formality. I won't use status to oppress you. Before Guan Yu, we're equals."

Hearing this, Qiqi opened her eyes. She'd already resolved that if Guan Yu accepted her, she'd gladly embrace this happiness with the man she loved. Should they reject her, she'd depart without resentment—this was her voluntary choice, requiring no obligation from others.

**Chapter 4333: It's Getting Late**

Wang Xiaorong's perceptive words surprised Qiqi, who hadn't realized her feelings were so transparent. Now seeing both accepted her, Qiqi felt content even as the junior consort.

Sitting up, Qiqi glimpsed Guan Yu and immediately averted her blushing face—though stealing furtive glances. Noticing her discomfort, Guan Yu retrieved his clothes. "My apologies. I forgot myself earlier."

"Stop pretending!" Wang Xiaorong huffed, hands on hips. "You two got what you wanted! Only I suffer here!"

Guan Yu approached remorsefully, kissing her forehead. "You're the most understanding, my dearest."

This tenderness dissolved Wang Xiaorong's anger completely. "Enough. Dawn approaches." She dressed briskly. "I'll fetch water for washing. Prepare to depart."

Though servants usually handled such tasks, Wang Xiaorong insisted on personally attending to Guan Yu. After she left, Qiqi sprang from bed, embracing Guan Yu shyly. "Last night...I did it deliberately, Handsome Master. Don't hate me?"

Guan Yu tapped her nose affectionately. "Did you think me truly drunk, you little vixen? Such boldness!"

Blissful despite physical discomfort, Qiqi clung like ivy. Guan Yu mused how this "elfin" girl—with her soul-stealing crescent eyes when smiling and wide innocent gaze otherwise—possessed greater passion than Wang Xiaorong.

When Wang Xiaorong returned with hot water trailed by her maidservant Auntie, Qiqi sat demurely dressed. "Qiqi, bring Guan Yu's meal," Wang Xiaorong instructed. Though normally forbidding servants entry, she made exceptions for Guan Yu's care.

As Wang Xiaorong tenderly washed Guan Yu's face, she advised: "Learn to tend him properly, Qiqi. This is women's work."

"I cared for Grandma at home—I'm capable!" Qiqi retorted proudly.

Guan Yu inquired: "How fare your grandparents? We should inform them."

"Shiniang already sent people to find them," Qiqi revealed. "They'll be brought here when found!"

Wang Xiaorong interjected while washing towels: "Still calling me 'Shiniang'? We're equals now. Call me sister."

Qiqi nodded. "Then...Xiaorong-jie and Yu-ge?"

"Ugh, how saccharine!" Wang Xiaorong teased, though soon imitated: "Yu-ge~ How's this?"

Guan Yu laughed. "Call me as you please." He foresaw endless rivalry between them.

**Chapter 4334: Out of Sight, Out of Mind**

After breakfast, Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi escorted Guan Yu to Demon Soul Sect's foothills, lingering reluctantly.

Returning to the inn during morning meal, Azhe whispered: "You stayed at Demon Soul Sect? With Wang Xiaorong?"

"Quiet!" Guan Yu hissed, wary of the blabbermouth. Entering, he noticed Siqi's strange look and Lin Chen's lavish spending with their funds.

"Eat up, Guan Yu!" Wang Jun called. Lin Chen boasted: "As treasurer, I ensure good living!"

Noticing Siqi hadn't worn his gifted dress, Guan Yu approached—only for Ling Su to seize the seat beside her. Siqi glared at Guan Yu before leaving when Ling Su pestered her with food.

After breakfast, Guan Yu announced: "We ride to Xiang City today, reaching desert's edge in two days." Horses were procured, though Guan Yu's steed Xiao Bai remained at Demon Soul Sect.

On the road, Ling Su and Lin Chen buzzed around Siqi until she spurred ahead. At noon rest, Guan Yu intercepted Ling Su's pestering: "I need Siqi for tasks."

"Can't you see we're talking?" Ling Su protested.

"Must I wait till night?" Guan Yu retorted. "Everyone tires of your antics—even Lin Chen."

**Chapter 4335: Responsibility**

Guiding Siqi aside, Guan Yu apologized: "Endure them a while longer. In desert, I'll make them regret troubling you."

Siqi challenged: "Why so confident? What if I prefer them?"

Guan Yu met her gaze steadily, the unspoken tension thickening between them as their journey's trials loomed ahead.
