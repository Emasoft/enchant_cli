**Feng Xin** remained silent throughout. As they left the private room, she cast a meaningful glance at Guan Yu and Gao Wei, smiling faintly, "There's still an empty room in the villa!"

Guan Yu felt utterly helpless, his heart filled with resignation. *What does Feng Xin mean by this? Does she really think every woman connected to me ends up being brought home? I might wish for that, but is it even possible?* A bitter smile surfaced on his face.

Gao Wei paid no attention to Feng Xin's words. Her gaze fixed peculiarly on Guan Yu, making him increasingly uncomfortable. "You've stared at me like this twice in two days. Am I really so handsome that you're infatuated?" Guan Yu suddenly turned to tease her.

"Ha! I could say you're not handsome at all—even men find you irresistible!" Gao Wei retorted scornfully. Guan Yu fell silent, mentally cursing Wu Xiaonian's ancestors. *Damn it, my image is completely ruined by him.*

"Guan Yu, you've angered Zhou Hongyan. Be careful he doesn't resort to desperate measures," Gao Wei warned earnestly. "As long as he has a shred of sense, he won't risk mutual destruction," Guan Yu replied confidently.

Gao Wei frowned, concern etching her features. "You're taking too great a risk! Even with his secrets in hand, you can't stop him from stabbing you in the back!" she fretted. "He might see those secrets as a threat to his life and retaliate!"

Guan Yu looked surprised, impressed by her sharp reasoning. "Are you... worried about me?" he teased. Gao Wei's expression turned serious. "This isn't a joke!"

"I'm not joking either. Zhou Hongyan lacks the means to destroy me. I have his secrets; he has none of mine. The video's already been retrieved!" Guan Yu declared with unshakable confidence.

**Chapter 791: Mountain Climbing**

"Because I hold his secrets, not vice versa!" Guan Yu's simple statement struck Gao Wei like thunder. She stared at him, dumbfounded. "When did you retrieve it?"

"Just now. You saw me make the call," he grinned. "Zhou Hongyan tried to trap me but ended up trapping himself. What a fool!"

Gao Wei sighed. "What if he'd lied about the video's location?" Guan Yu shrugged. "I had to take the risk."

Unspoken was his use of the **Detection System** to verify Zhou Hongyan's truthfulness. "Why did you make Wu Xiaonian... do *that* to Zhou Hongyan?" Gao Wei asked.

"For you!" Guan Yu replied casually. "He's a threat to your career. Now, he might become your asset instead."

Moved, Gao Wei whispered, "Thank you." "We're friends," Guan Yu smiled.

**Chapter 792: Dark Night, Ghosts!**

The undeveloped Mount Mulanshan proved treacherous. Gao Wei struggled through thorns, her hands bloodied, while Guan Yu bounded ahead effortlessly. "We need to reach the summit before dark!" he called back.

Exhausted, Gao Wei collapsed halfway. Spotting her distress, Guan宇 suddenly reappeared. "Take my hand." Reluctantly, she accepted.

Noticing her limp, Guan宇 abruptly hoisted her onto his back. "Let's go!" Against protests, he carried her up the mountain.

They reached the summit at sunset. "How beautiful!" Gao维 marveled. "Help me set up camp," Guan Yu grumbled, exhausted.

After dinner, Guan宇 retired to the tent. "Beware—it's pitch black, and there are ghosts!" he teased. A distant wolf howl sent Gao维 scrambling into the tent.

**Chapter 793: Night Battle, Counterattack**

Under cover of darkness, armed figures with night-vision goggles and submachine guns crept toward the summit. Among them limped a vengeful figure muttering, "Guan Yu, I'll make sure you die without glory!"
