Guan Yu shook his head, looking at Lin Feng with mocking eyes. “Seems you still don’t understand me. If anyone’s dying here, it’s you. I told you—you can’t touch me.”

Lin Feng’s fury erupted at these words. He felt utterly humiliated. Their gang was called the Gun Gang for a reason—their absolute confidence in marksmanship. As their leader, his reputation for speed and precision was renowned throughout L City. Yet this top-tier shooter had been repeatedly belittled by Guan Yu’s claims of dodging bullets. Were it not for his brothers present, he’d have blown this arrogant youth’s brains out already.

“Not only will you die—I’ll wipe your Gun Gang from existence.” A cold voice cut through the crowd. People parted to reveal Feng Xin in a black gown, glaring furiously at Lin Feng. Behind her stood the nervous Zhao Jing’er and dozens of submachine gun-tlackeys.

Wen Qing stood among them, her clear eyes observing the scene without trace of drunkenness—a mirror of Feng Xin’s composure.

Lin Feng’s eyelid twitched violently. Though he didn’t recognize this brazen woman, the firepower at her back screamed formidable connections.

Feng Xin resumed her authoritative demeanor. “Lower your gun. Do it and live.”

“And if I refuse?” Lin Feng narrowed his eyes with mocking amusement.

He couldn’t be cowed by a woman’s threats—not after clawing his way to lead the Gun Gang. Their strength demanded catastrophic losses from any attacker, and he’d weathered countless storms. A woman’s condescension only stoked his defiance.

“Harm one hair on his head,” Feng Xin said coolly, “and you’ll be Swiss cheese. Don’t test me.”

Lin Feng’s expression turned peculiar. So Guan Yu’s bravado came from a woman’s backing—a pretty boy relying on his mistress!

“You’re the damn gigolo!” Guan Yu exploded. “Your whole family’s gigolos!”

Unbeknownst to others, Guan Yu had kept his Detection System active, reading Lin Feng’s thoughts. The madman actually considered shooting! A true desperado.

How could someone as dashing as him—beloved by women—be a kept man? Lin Feng must be blind, Guan Yu narcissistically mused.

This insult twisted Lin Feng’s face into ugliness. Orphaned since childhood, he held sacred notions of family. Parents were inviolable—his deepest taboo. Those who mocked this always ended with bullet-shattered skulls.

Blind rage overrode caution. Lin Feng abruptly pulled the trigger.

Chapter 390: Gunfire Resounds, Lin Feng Falls

Guan Yu’s active Detection System forewarned him. Pupils contracting—he couldn’t believe Lin Feng would shoot despite the odds.

Without hesitation, he activated his Gravity Manipulation System. Forty percent weight enhancement struck Lin Feng’s trigger finger and the fired bullet. Simultaneously, he crouched and launched himself like a cannonball at Lin Feng’s abdomen.

Gunshot echoed. Lin Feng fell.

Guan Yu narrowly dodged, strands of hair singed by the bullet’s heat.

Everything happened too fast. By the time Feng Xin’s group reacted, one of Lin Feng’s men lay dead from a stray bullet. Lin Feng stared up at his conqueror, shock and disbelief in his eyes.

This reflexes... this speed... defied nature. How?

The crowd stood stunned. Someone actually outpaced bullets at point-blank range?

Feng Xin had heard Grandfather’s tales of Guan Yu dodging gunfire, but witnessing it proved far more visceral.

Recovering first, her anger reignited. Lin Feng had dared shoot despite her warning—as if her forces meant nothing!

At her command, Lin Feng’s men surrendered instantly. The firepower disparity left no hope—only fools would resist without their leader’s courage.

Guan Yu crouched beside Lin Feng, smirk playing on his lips. “Told you you’re outmatched. But why suddenly snap like a rabid dog?”

Lin Feng sneered through bloodied lips. “I’ve lost. Kill me or torture me—stop prattling.”

“Oho, spine intact? For that, I’ll spare you. Take your men and vanish. Cross me again—no mercy.” Guan Yu stood casually.

Lin Feng blinked, mind reeling. After nearly killing him, Guan Yu spared them for... pride? Preposterous.

“Think I’ll buy that?” he spat. “Man up—no tricks.”

Truthfully, Guan Yu’s mercy stemmed from glimpsing Lin Feng’s motive through Detection—the orphan’s rage over parental disrespect. Sympathy overruled vengeance.

Feng Xin shot Guan Yu a questioning look but stayed silent, trusting his judgment.

“Who doesn’t have parents?” Guan Yu mused aloud. “Many rage for lovers—how many for family?”

Half-orphaned himself, Guan Yu understood.

Lin Feng stiffened. Unexpected emotion surged—did Guan Yu read his mind? The gigolo insult, the parental rage... A sliver of awe tempered his hatred.

Guan Yu turned. “Leave. Now. Honest warning—I don’t usually release tigers to mountains.”

Struggling up, Lin Feng met his eyes. “This mercy I’ll remember. I’ll repay it someday.”

As Lin Feng departed, only Wang Hu remained trembling. Having witnessed Guan Yu’s might, he collapsed pleading: “Spare me! Money, women—take this art student! She’s amazing in—”

Guan Yu’s foot smashed his face. “I detest men using women as shields. Try that again—I’ll neuter you.”

After several more kicks, Guan Yu growled: “Vanish. Third strike—you die.”

Wang Hu scrambled away, thoroughly broken.

Post-cleanup, Guan Yu told Luo Cheng: “Dismiss the men. Tidy up.”

Luo Cheng nodded fervently—Guan Yu’s status soared higher. Card mastery, medical skills, underworld connections, and now superhuman combat? A polymath.

Turning to Feng Xin’s group, Guan Yu grinned: “Sis Xin—more drinks?”

Feng Xin arched a brow at Wen Qing. “We drink till someone drops.”

Wen Qing wordlessly marched back to the VIP room.

Guan Yu paled—why’d he mention drinking? Their rivalry meant suffering for him.

The crowd reentered buzzing—tonight’s spectacle exceeded all.

Only drunken Mo Ling and Du Xiaojuan remained. Pale-faced, Du Xiaojuan pleaded: “Never risk like that again! I nearly died of fear.”

Guan Yu caressed her hair. “Don’t worry. With you here, I’d never leave.”

Mo Ling watched their intimacy, eyes dimming.

Chapter 391: Mo Ling’s Heartbreak

Female intuition proved terrifying. From fragments of conversation, Mo Ling sensed their unusual bond.

Seven-tenths drunk, she slumped at the table—lonely tears glistening.

Du Xiaojuan nudged Guan Yu. “She’s my teacher. Too drunk to go alone—please escort her.”

Guan Yu frowned at the comatose Mo Ling.

Agony pierced Mo Ling’s heart—would he refuse even this?

Stumbling up, she slurred: “Who says I’m leaving? More wine!”

She collapsed dramatically.

Du Xiaojuan tried helping, but Mo Ling shoved her aside. Guan Yu’s patience snapped—he hauled Mo Ling onto a sofa. “Enough madness!”

“Don’t be rough!” Du Xiaojuan pleaded. “She’s troubled.”

“Her problems don’t excuse harming others,” Guan Yu retorted.

Mo Ling clutched her chest as if stabbed. Staggering out, she vanished into the night.

Du Xiaojuan glared. “That was cruel! She’s in danger alone!”

Guan Yu sighed, admitting his harshness. “I’ll find her. You stay.”

As Du Xiaojuan left, she suddenly asked: “You know her, don’t you?”

Guan Yu nodded.

“I see.” Her meaningful glance chilled him.

Outside, snowflakes danced under dim streetlights. Mo Ling’s elongated shadow wavered drunkenly. Tears froze on her cheeks as cars narrowly missed her.

When a truck’s horn blared, she numbly awaited death—until strong arms yanked her to safety.

Cradled against Guan Yu’s chest during the rescue, Mo Ling finally found peace. By the roadside, she slept soundly in his arms, forehead bleeding.

Unable to summon taxis, Guan Yu carried her back. Luo Cheng leered: “Need a hotel room, Boss?”

“Drive us home,” Guan Yu snapped.

At the villa, he treated Mo Ling’s wounds secretly. As he healed her forehead, she suddenly embraced him—pressing his face into her bosom.

Chapter 393: Xiao Xiong Emerges

Screams startled everyone. Four women gaped at Mo Ling’s compromising position.

Mo Ling blinked in shock, meeting their scandalized stares.
