Guan Yu grew anxious upon hearing this, never expecting Ma Hai to be so cunning. The man actually intended to target his friends first before dealing with him. If Wei Hongwei encountered this master-disciple pair, the outcome would be dire—either death or permanent disability. They stood no chance against them.

Martial Master Wu contemplated their situation. To cure his disciple’s serpent venom, he would endure a few more days in the city. Truthfully, neither he nor his disciple enjoyed urban life. They far preferred the simplicity of the forest, free from worldly troubles.

The pair had been brought here two days prior by Ma Hai’s men. Unable to sleep in the hotel room—far less comfortable than their usual treetop rest—they had ventured into this grove to spend the night.

The previous evening, Li Yuan had arranged two women to “entertain” the master and disciple. To everyone’s surprise, Martial Master Wu had grown rather fond of the indulgence, leading to tonight’s escapade.

“Disciple, swallow this and meditate. Guard against the venom reaching your heart,” Martial Master Wu said, passing the Serpent King’s Gallbladder.

The Snake-Eyed Youth obediently sat, gulping down the fist-sized organ before crossing his legs to channel his energy.

Years ago, Martial Master Wu had kidnapped a village child out of spite, only to discover the boy’s blood unexpectedly neutralized his own poison. Over time, he’d grown deeply attached to the child. Even if it cost him his life, he’d cure the boy’s affliction. Seeing his disciple safe, he told Ma Hai, “I’ll aid you—but each task requires a Serpent King’s Gallbladder. No gallbladder, no service.”

“Understood. I’ll keep you supplied,” Ma Hai chuckled, pleased to secure their formidable strength.

As Ma Hai departed, his hands roamed his companion’s curves, eliciting giggles.

Guan Yu breathed a sigh of relief. Overhearing this plot had saved Wei Hongwei. He’d need to arrange protection immediately.

Once Ma Hai’s group left, Guan Yu tapped Hou Jinshun’s shoulder and emerged from behind the tree. They couldn’t let these two reach Wei Hongwei.

A rustle startled Martial Master Wu. “Who’s there?”

“Forgotten me already?” Hou Jinshun stepped forward.

After confirming Ma Hai’s departure, Guan Yu guided Hou Jinshun from hiding. They couldn’t risk the duo finding Wei Hongwei. At the grove’s noise, Martial Master Wu barked, “Who goes there?”

Approaching, the master recognized them. “You? What do you want?” Panic flickered across his face—his disciple’s meditation couldn’t be interrupted without risking qi deviation.

“We compensated you at the bar. Was it insufficient?”

“We’re not here for money,” Guan Yu smiled. “We seek friendship.” He noted the master’s wariness.

Indeed, with his disciple vulnerable, Martial Master Wu stood little chance against both men. “I desire no friends.”

“Yet you partnered with Ma Hai,” Guan Yu countered.

“State your business. Here to rob us?”

“We care not for wealth. We heard you plan to target Wei Hongwei.”

The master conceded, “What of it?”

“I am Guan Yu.” His tone turned icy. Knowing the Snake-Eyed Youth couldn’t be disturbed, he revealed his identity.

Martial Master Wu shielded his disciple. “Guan Yu?!” Regret flooded him. *Ma Hai tricked me! This man’s power far exceeds mine. We’re doomed.*

“Relax. We mean no harm.” Guan Yu feigned nonchalance.

Hou Jinshun interjected, “Ma Hai’s exploiting you for gallbladders. Is it worth it?”

“The venom’s terminal. We’ve no choice.”

Seizing their vulnerability, Guan Yu signaled Hou Jinshun. They struck without warning.

Guan Yu lunged, activating a glowing shield. The master barely parried as Hou Jinshun feigned an attack on the meditating youth. Distracted, Martial Master Wu took a kick to the shoulder, electricity-like pain numbing his arm.

Hou Jinshun’s feint became a crushing punch. Guan Yu pressed the assault, but the master split into two clones—one guarding his disciple, the other fighting.

The clones’ divided strength became apparent. As Hou Jinshun faltered, Guan Yu redirected attacks toward the youth, forcing the master to intercept. “Coward!” the master spat.

After dozens of exchanges, Guan Yu landed a decisive blow to the disciple’s head, spraying blood. As the clones merged, Guan Yu detonated his shield, blasting the master against a tree. Black blood spewed as he collapsed.

“How did this venom afflict you?” Guan Yu approached, concern overriding hostility.

Hou Jinshun trembled—had the master fought unrestrained, they’d have lost.

Guan Yu marveled at the man’s skill: *A Boundary Sovereign expert, weakened only by poison.*

“You’re despicable!” the master choked.

“This isn’t a duel. Victory justifies means,” Guan Yu stated coldly.

**Chapter 2005: Life Hangs by a Thread**

Guan Yu acknowledged the master’s formidable cultivation—a Boundary Sovereign whose poison-diminished strength still challenged them.

“Despicable!” the master repeated, coughing blood.

“State your demands,” he wheezed. Hou Jinshun’s gaze urged execution, but Guan Yu hesitated—these were pawns, not villains.

“I respect your skill. Without protecting your disciple, we’d have fallen.”

The master laughed bitterly. “Spare the flattery. Your energy dwarfs mine. That’s why I complied at the bar.”

Guan Yu realized the misunderstanding—his sealed power created an illusion of strength. “Mercy kept you alive. Now, explain your venom.”

To save his disciple, the master recounted his past:

“Years ago, during the Zhang family massacre…” His gaze fell on the unconscious youth. “I was their steward, Qing Linger’s father.”

Guan Yu started. “You’re Qing Linger’s father? The Zhangs’ head servant?”

Shock widened the master’s eyes. “How…?”

“Your daughter lives. I’ll take you to her.”

Sealing the master’s meridians, Guan Yu ordered Hou Jinshun to carry the disciple. They sped to Pan Taisheng’s apartment.

Qing Linger opened the door to find her long-lost father bleeding on the sofa.

“Dad…?” she whispered, tears cascading.

“My Ling’er… so grown…” His voice broke, decades of separation crumbling in a moment.

**Chapter 2006: All Grown Up**

Qing Linger trembled, recognizing the eyes she’d seen in childhood photos. Six years old when the Zhangs fell, she’d clung to his memory.

Her delicate hands muffled sobs as she collapsed beside him.

Martial Master Wu—Qing Da—reached a shaking hand toward her. “I searched… but the poison… the追杀…”

Guan Yu interjected, “He saved the Zhang heir during the attack. The venom came from snake-summoning assassins.”

Qing Da nodded weakly. “The four great families… they used serpents…”

As Guan Yu stabilized Qing Da’s condition, Qing Linger clung to her father’s arm. The reunion overflowed with tears and fractured history—a daughter’s lost years meeting a father’s desperate survival.

In that moment, vengeance and cultivation tiers faded. Only blood and healing remained.
