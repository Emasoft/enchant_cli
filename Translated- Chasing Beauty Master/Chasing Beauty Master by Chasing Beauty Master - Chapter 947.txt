Amei seemed to be getting along well with Yingzi. She said, “Why don’t I show you the rooms first? You must be tired from the journey. Once you pick one you like, I’ll tidy it up for you. Come on, there are plenty of rooms here.”

She took Yingzi’s hand, and the two chattered like sparrows as they climbed the stairs.

Before long, Lü Mei, Zhang Han, and Lan Yu hurriedly rushed out from the bedroom. The moment Zhang Han saw Guan Yu, she leapt up like a delighted kitten and plopped into his lap. “Big Brother! Sister Yu’er said you brought a beauty back! Where is she? Did you hide her? Bring her out so we can see!”

Her words drew laughter from everyone. Guan Yu pinched her cheek and said, “There’s a new sister here. You must call her Sister Yingzi from now on. No cheeky remarks, little one.”

“I’m not a child!” Zhang Han pouted. “I’ve even slept with Big Brother! How can I still be called a child?”

While others found this amusing, Lan Yu felt a pang of discomfort. Her heart churned with confusion over Guan Yu’s feelings. She had once offered herself to him willingly, but he refused, claiming she was too young—though he insisted he liked her. Now, seeing Zhang Han, who shared her age and even had a smaller frame, being embraced by Guan Yu, Lan Yu couldn’t understand why she remained untouched.

Stepping forward, Lan Yu declared, “Guan Yu, I’ll be staying here for a while. Boss Lan is eager to hold a grandchild, after all.”

Guan Yu froze, understanding her implication. “Stay if you wish,” he sighed. “Your room remains yours. No one will compete for it.”

His response surprised everyone. Lü Mei and Yang Conghan exchanged glances while others shot disapproving looks at Lan Yu, though she held her head high defiantly.

Zhang Han snorted. “Hmph! Your Boss Lan isn’t the only one impatient. My Grandpa Yang’s hair has turned white waiting, but I’ve kept quiet!”

Lan Yu retorted, “I don’t care! I refuse to be the only woman Guan Yu hasn’t touched. I’m staying!”

Yang Conghan smirked, glancing at Guan Yu. “Who knew you had such restraint? Lan Yu’s a lively, adorable beauty with that youthful charm. Not your usual style to hold back.”

“Enough jokes,” Guan Yu groaned, exasperated. Zhang Han munched on an apple in his arms, unfazed.

Yang Conghan continued, “Things may be chaotic, but you brought this on yourself. Oh, and I’ll be moving in too. Grandpa Yang is also desperate for a great-grandchild.”

Laughter erupted again as Yang Conghan and the others dispersed, leaving Guan Yu slumped on the sofa with a half-eaten apple.

He knew Yang Conghan’s jest held truth—the elders’ urgency was real. But fatherhood? He wasn’t ready. His brooding was interrupted by a call from Wei Hongwei.

“Boss! Help! I’m doomed!” Wei Hongwei wailed.

“What happened?”

“Qian Yaoyao wants to break up! It’s all Jia Bo’s fault! We were at the school cafeteria last night when—”

Guan Yu cut him off angrily. “You idiot! You have Yaoyao, yet you still fool around? Serves you right!”

“Please, Boss! I’ll explain everything in person!”

After arranging a meeting, Guan Yu asked Lü Mei to check on Qian Yaoyao. Though reluctant, she agreed.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei arrived bruised and limping. “Qian Yunqi beat me up for hurting Yaoyao,” he mumbled.

Guan Yu facepalmed. “You brought this on yourself. But first—Jia Bo’s in trouble. He messed with Ge Yinglai’s woman.”

A call to Jia Bo’s number revealed Ge Yinglai’s threat: “Your boy’s with me. Let’s negotiate.”

Guan Yu’s voice turned icy. “Harm him, and you’ll pay tenfold.”

Ge Yinglai sneered, “He trespassed. What’s it worth to you?”

“Your woman was in a *public* place. Let him go, and I’ll owe you.”

“Or what? Your women in Qiaoyuan District aren’t branded either.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Mine stay home. Yours? Left for anyone. Let’s not squabble over scraps.”

The tension crackled—a storm brewing as Guan Yu prepared to reclaim his friend and confront the rising chaos.
