After several rounds, Guan Yu began to fold again, irritating the players at the table. Yet there was nothing they could do—without decent cards, how could they force him to keep betting?

“The two-hundred base pot is dull. Let’s raise it to a thousand?” the bald middle-aged man proposed casually while examining his cards, as if speaking to himself.

Originally, the two-hundred contribution was merely pooled for the dealer. This sudden proposal to raise it to a thousand clearly targeted Guan Yu’s cautious playstyle.

“Fine by me,” the middle-aged man in a white shirt said indifferently.

Seeing the others glance at him questioningly, Guan Yu spread his hands. “You gentlemen decide. I’m just here for fun—it makes no difference to me.”

His response drew chuckles from the group as they resumed play.

Half an hour later, the stack of bills before Guan Yu steadily grew. Even he had lost count of his winnings.

“Has he won half a million yet?” Luo Cheng whispered to Niu Le.

“Not quite—476,400,” Du Xiaojuan answered softly, her large eyes glinting.

The room fell silent. This girl had been nervously tallying the winnings all along!

Her remark prompted the businessmen to reassess Guan Yu. The kid’s luck seemed uncanny—whenever he received cards, he always emerged victorious. Did he never get middling hands worth following when others held strong cards?

This question gnawed at everyone. Remaining undefeated for half an hour reeked of strangeness.

“Boring… blind bet! Ten thousand!” The white-shirted man tossed in chips without glancing at his newly dealt cards.

Blind betting forced others who checked their cards to double the stake—10,000 became 20,000.

“I’ll bet blind too!” The bald man raised his brows challengingly.

All eyes turned to Guan Yu when his turn came.

Frowning slightly, Guan Yu drew a breath. Though he already knew everyone’s cards, he couldn’t reveal his awareness. He picked up his three cards.

After matching two rounds of 20,000 bets, he pursed his lips and folded. These tycoons were using their wealth to corner him—winning further wouldn’t be easy.

The second round saw renewed blind betting.

Guan Yu checked his cards, followed two rounds, then folded.

The third round repeated this pattern.

Though these magnates could lose hundreds of thousands without blinking, their pride bristled at being bested by a penniless youth ecstatic over trivial wins. Watching Guan Yu finally lose money soothed their egos, encouraging more reckless betting.

When the next round dealt, Guan Yu watched the first two players blindly toss in 10,000. Feigning resolve, he threw in his own stack.

“You’re…?” The group stared. Hadn’t this cautious mouse learned to bet blind?

“No point checking—I can’t afford to follow if I see,” Guan Yu said petulantly.

The table erupted in laughter as they summoned a lackey for drinks, casually hurling money into the pot.

Within moments, four players had built a mountain of cash at the table’s center.

“Still not looking? Your entire haul might vanish,” a young dandy teased.

“It’s house money anyway. All in!” Guan Yu feigned nonchalance.

Initially betting blind out of pique, Guan Yu’s imitation provoked the white-shirted man to check his cards. After a stony pause, he slammed down a 2-3-6 combination with displeasure.

Unseen by others, Guan Yu noted the man’s miserable luck.

Two rounds later, a gold-chain-adorned businessman checked his cards—two kings—and stayed. Guan Yu knew he’d cling to such a strong blind hand.

Five minutes later, nearly two million crowded the table, mesmerizing onlookers.

Such stakes between multiple blind betters were rare, born from the tycoons’ pique. Guan Yu’s pounding heart nearly betrayed him—this round would be legendary!

Chapter 162: The Windfall

As stacks disappeared into the pot, Guan Yu’s tension mounted. Decades of poverty might end tonight through three cards. His racing pulse threatened to deafen the room.

Youth served him well—an elder might’ve collapsed from the strain.

Other tycoons began checking hands. Though each had only invested hundreds of thousands, even wealth demanded prudence.

The bald man grinned at a 9-10-J straight—a blind bet jackpot worth millions. Guan Yu hid a smirk. Impressive… but insufficient against his trap.

Subsequent rounds intensified. Guan Yu’s unwavering blind bets forced 20,000 raises, swelling the pot exponentially. He struggled to maintain a poker face.

“Not checking yet?” The bald man lit a cigarette.

“Why bother? My small bets lure your big ones. Whoever wins, I profit.” Guan Yu’s reply drew chuckles and continued betting.

Minutes later, the pot doubled again. The gold-chain man finally cracked, paying 40,000 to reveal the bald man’s straight. With a resigned shrug, he folded.

Down to three players, the white-shirted man revealed a club flush. Crowds gathered, including Fourth Master Bao, drawn by the million-dollar spectacle.

“Out of cash,” the bald man announced. To Guan Yu’s confusion, he produced car keys. “My three-month-old Land Rover—collateral for 500,000.”

The club flush holder shrugged acceptance. Bao Fourth offered cash conversion, but Guan Yu hesitated.

“Relax, kid. If you prefer cash, I’ll buy the car,” Bao Fourth said.

“Fourth Brother! Already writing my obituary?” The bald man joked.

Cars as stakes! Guan Yu marveled at their madness. Would wives be next? He wisely kept this thought private.

The Rover’s value vanished into the pot within minutes. “Reveal!” The bald man demanded.

The club flush emerged, dashing his hopes. He cursed and stormed off.

The stone-faced white-shirted man finally smiled, turning to Guan Yu.

“Haven’t checked mine,” Guan Yu shrugged.

Bao Fourth flipped the first card—6 of clubs. Then 8 of clubs. The room held its breath.

“Is it… 7 of clubs?” Bao Fourth rasped.

The reveal sparked chaos. Du Xiaojuan nearly broke Guan Yu’s arm shaking him. Niu Le gaped like a fool.

“Luck! Pure luck!” Guan Yu laughed, slapping his thigh.

Counting 3.4 million, the deflated tycoons burned with resentment. Losing to peers was tolerable, but this upstart draining their cash and cars? Unforgivable.

Chapter 163: Grandmaster of Deception

As Guan Yu’s crew packed four suitcases with million-yuan stacks, Bao Fourth’s men brought extras for the remaining 300,000.

“Keep the change for drinks,” Guan Yu declared, drawing covert sneers—nouveau riche posturing.

When he rose to leave, the gold-chain man snapped: “Leaving after winning?”

Guan Yu turned, mock-innocent. “Can’t take winnings? Must I leave collateral?”

The sarcasm bit deep. Regulars could depart freely, but newcomers? Never.

“Hit-and-run? Think we’re ATMs?”

“My mistake! Let’s continue!” Guan Yu grinned, reseating himself.

“New deck!” the gold-chain man ordered. Suspicion hung thick—even Bao Fourth fell under scrutiny.

A hotel-supplied deck arrived, breaking Bao Fourth’s control. The tycoons watched Guan Yu like hawks.

Yet the pattern continued—strategic small losses, devastating wins. Thirty minutes later, glares turned venomous.

“Fourth Brother, know this kid well?” the gold-chain man asked casually.

“First meeting today. Boss Luo brought him.”
