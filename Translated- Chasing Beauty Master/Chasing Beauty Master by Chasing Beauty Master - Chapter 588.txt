**Chapter 1489: The Restless Qi Sea**

Having resolved to unblock his remaining two meridians that very night, Guan Yu’s jubilant expression suddenly flickered with unease. He hastily rolled up his sleeve to inspect his arm. Relief washed over him as he found no injuries, the momentary worry dissolving back into triumph.

His concern stemmed from yesterday’s ordeal, where his arm had suffered under the strain of cultivation. Yet now, after enduring another violent surge of energy, it showed no signs of damage—proof of its newfound resilience.

Assured of his safety, Guan Yu descended the mountain with renewed determination to complete his task. Upon returning home, he exchanged a silent glance with Wang Xiao before retreating to his chamber. Wang Xiao, noting Guan Yu’s improved vigor compared to the previous day’s exhaustion, chose not to interfere. He understood the delicate balance required during critical breakthroughs—excessive meddling might disrupt Guan Yu’s rhythm.

Settling onto his bed, Guan Yu immediately began channeling energy to unblock the final meridians. With practiced efficiency, he cleared one swiftly, then seized the momentum to assault the last. Drawing a deep breath, he guided spiritual energy through the stubborn pathway leading to his dantian. Success came quickly, flooding him with elation—until the newly calmed Qi Sea within his dantian abruptly stirred.

The disturbance intensified rapidly. The once-modest Qi Sea expanded visibly, spawning whirling vortices of spiritual energy. These maelstroms drew ambient energy toward Guan Yu’s body with terrifying force. His skin strained under the pressure, capillaries rupturing into bloody trails. Only when searing pain pierced his dazed euphoria did he snap back to awareness.

Frantically, Guan Yu sought the cause while resisting the invasive energy. His investigations proved futile as the Qi Sea swelled dangerously, vortices threatening to shred his dantian. Accelerating energy currents worsened the onslaught—blood droplets now fell from his arms.

“Damn it! What’s gone wrong?” he cursed. “Everything worked before! Was rushing the process my mistake?” Unbeknownst to him, each meridian unblocking required intervals for the Qi Sea to stabilize. Flooding it with fresh energy before equilibrium caused this chaotic backlash—a lethal trap where rampant energy forces blood from the body.

As blood loss mounted, terror gripped Guan Yu. Was history repeating? Would he bleed out twice? Just as despair tightened its hold, his mysterious stone heart blazed with radiant light, enveloping him in a protective cocoon.

Stunned, Guan Yu stared at his glowing chest. The foreign object hidden within him—a stone heart shrouded in dark cyan luminescence—had shielded him. Cut off from external energy, his Qi Sea gradually settled, the bleeding ceased.

Awed by this power, Guan Yu probed his chest with spiritual sense. Beneath the impenetrable glow lurked an unidentable entity. Exhausted and qi-depleted, he abandoned further inquiry, resolving to replenish his energy elsewhere.

**Chapter 1490: The Witch**

At dawn, Guan Yu ascended to his mountain cultivation spot. Inhaling the rich spiritual energy, he grinned. “Perfect. Recovery won’t take long here.”

Channeling all six unblocked meridians, he unleashed a voracious absorption. Ambient energy rippled toward him, coalescing into a massive vortex. Distant energies streamed into the growing maelstrom—a testament to his enhanced capabilities.

Meanwhile, recollections surfaced: nights in primitive lands where tribesmen attacked, coveting his lighter and dagger. After slaying two assailants and wounding a third, Guan Yu sheltered in a cave. Using herbal remedies provided by a native woman, he healed while evading predators.

Ambushed by spear-wielding tribesmen, he anticipated death until their leader—a burly middle-aged man—fixated on his possessions. Brought to their valley tribe of four hundred, Guan Yu met their queen, who bore resemblance to the herbalist woman. A black-robed crone flanked the ruler.

Though language barriers forced pantomime, the queen hosted him lavishly, assigning a maidservant. The tribe’s hostility centered on jealousy—Guan Yu’s connection to the future queen (the herbalist) bred resentment, particularly from a dark-skinned youth.

During convalescence, Guan Yu photographed a girl chasing butterflies—an act that drew her curious approach. Their budding rapport ended when her brother (the hostile youth) intervened. Later, healed and ready to depart, Guan Yu informed the queen.

At his farewell, she mentioned the imminent Sacrificial Ceremony coinciding with hunting captain elections. Initially indifferent, Guan Yu joined upon learning the captain’s meat ration bonus.

Through grueling training, he compensated for physical shortcomings with ingenuity—inventing the first bow. On competition eve, he witnessed suspicious activity: a conspirator smuggling a leather pouch.

The contest required hunters to return by sunset with maximal prey. Confident despite limited catches, Guan Yu faced sabotage—the rival youth released venomous snakes, stealing his game. Trapped treetop, Guan Yu repelled serpents with improvised tactics: whistling distractions and scent-lured attacks.

**Chapter 1491: Realm of Spiritual Energy**

Back in cultivation crisis, Guan Yu’s frantic energy assaults on the stone heart’s cyan barrier proved futile. Each spiritual strike vanished into the glow, draining his reserves. Dizziness warned of qi exhaustion.

“What devilry is this?” he spat. “No effect despite full-force attacks!” Panic surged as he lost control—the Qi Sea autonomously channeled energy against the barrier.

Realizing retaliation for his aggression, Guan Yu mentally entreated: “Forgive my intrusion, noble presence! Mere curiosity, no malice intended!” Miraculously, the energy outflow ceased.

Skeptical yet hopeful, he questioned the entity’s identity, receiving silence. Concluding the stone heart deemed him unworthy of response, Guan Yu accepted his weakness, vowing future strength.

Focusing on replenishment, he found ambient energy insufficient. “A richer spiritual locus is needed,” he resolved.

Next morning at his peak cultivation site, Guan Yu unleashed his meridians’ full absorption. Energy cascaded into a colossal vortex, astonishing even himself. The six-meridian synergy’s power surpassed expectations—a thrilling, perilous revelation.
