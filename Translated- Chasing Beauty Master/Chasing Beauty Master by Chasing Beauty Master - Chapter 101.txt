Chapter 245: I Don’t Hit Women

Niu Le’s face turned ashen as he rose to make way, his ox-like eyes glaring furiously at Fu Lili.

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes, scanning Fu Lili up and down with disdain before retorting sharply, “Are you talking? Your breath reeks—do you have halitosis, or did you just eat shit and fart? It’s so foul!”

His absurdly serious delivery left Fu Lili momentarily stunned.

“You little punk! Who are you insulting? Looking for a beating?” she finally roared, rolling up her sleeves and lunging at Guan Yu.

“Scram, you brain-dead hag! Think I won’t slap you? Get the hell out of here!” Guan Yu stepped forward, chest thrust out, his threat unflinching.

Fu Lili faltered. She hadn’t expected such defiance. Glancing at his tall frame and the three burly boys behind him, she realized physical confrontation would only end in humiliation.

“You call yourself a man? Hitting a woman—aren’t you ashamed? Isn’t this humiliating?!” she spat, shrinking backward despite her words.

“Shut your stinking mouth! Don’t expect everyone to coddle your rotten temper. Get lost before you make everyone vomit!” Guan Yu sneered, jerking his chin at Niu Le. “If this idiot keeps yapping, slap her. Got it?”

Niu Le gaped, struggling before muttering, “Bro... I don’t hit women!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes and turned to Wang Zhen and Tian Hao. Both averted their gazes, clearly unwilling to strike a girl—a surefire way to become campus laughingstocks.

“Pathetic. Bitches like her just need a good thrashing. Watch!” Guan Yu lunged, arm raised menacingly.

“Ah!” Fu Lili shrieked, ducking behind Xue Yan.

Xue Yan paled, ready to scream—until Guan Yu lowered his hand, smirking. “Keep your shit-stained mouth shut if you don’t want slapped!”

Courtesy was wasted on those who mistook kindness for weakness.

As Guan Yu’s group strode away, Fu Lili trembled with rage. “You’ll pay for this!” she hissed through gritted teeth.

“Lili, calm down—”

“Don’t touch me! I’ll make that bastard regret crossing me!” Tears of fury welled in her eyes. No one had ever dared treat her this way!

*I’ll have him beaten to pulp!* She stomped her foot, plotting vengeance.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s group lounged in a lakeside pavilion, smoking and chatting as if nothing had happened. Their peace shattered when eight boys charged toward them, led by two wielding wooden sticks.

“There they are! Get them!” roared the leader, Lao Hei.

Guan Yu blinked—*revenge already?*

From her classroom window, Fu Lili watched coldly. *Let’s see you smirk now!*

Niu Le sprang up first, catching a swung stick mid-air. His counterpunch sent Lao Hei sprawling. Snatching the weapon, he laid into the attackers like a berserk bull—fists and feet flying until all eight lay groaning.

“Think I won’t hit men?!” Niu Le barked, battering the fallen with the stick.

As Lao Hei scrambled to flee, onlookers gaped. Eight against one—crushed in seconds!

“These morons followed Big Brother Jin from the junior class,” Wang Zhen worriedly warned. “He’s connected to off-campus gangs.”

“Let them come,” Guan Yu shrugged. Campus thugs were child’s play.

Returning to class, they ignored Fu Lili’s venomous glare. Minutes later, chaos erupted as twenty-odd students stormed in, led by Big Brother Jin—a yellow-haired punk with ear studs.

“You. Out. Now,” Jin sneered from the lectern.

Guan Yu rose languidly. As Jin turned to leave, Guan Yu lunged—arm hooked around his neck—*SLAP!* The crack echoed.

Niu Le swung a cleaver from his bag, blood spraying as steel met flesh. Wang Zhen and Tian Hao smashed chairs into advancing thugs.

Dragging Jin by the hair, Guan Yu bashed his head against doorframes and walls. “Still want a fight?!” he growled at the cowering mob.

One brave soul charged with a knife—only to be cut down by Niu Le’s crimson blade. The rest scattered like roaches.

Guan Yu dumped Jin’s limp form. “Anyone else?”

Silence.

Chapter 246: Sudden Strike

The classroom froze. Twenty attackers—neutralized by four. Jin’s followers hesitated, torn between loyalty and self-preservation.

Guan Yu wiped bloodied hands, eyeing the retreating crowd. “Spread the word: cross us again, and hell follows.”

Fu Lili watched, face ghostly pale, as Guan Yu’s group reclaimed their seats. Her vengeance lay broken—for now.
