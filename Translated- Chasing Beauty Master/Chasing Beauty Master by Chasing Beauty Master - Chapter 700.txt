Guan Yu couldn’t help but feel curious. What was there to thank him for? He turned and asked, “What are you thanking me for?” Truthfully, he hadn’t intended to kill Han Qiao—just to teach him a harsh lesson. People were like livestock; if they grew disobedient over time, a good beating was needed to keep them in line.

“Thank you… for listening to me and not attacking him,” Lü Mei whispered.

“Don’t thank me. My restraint had nothing to do with you. I only stopped because the homeroom teacher showed up,” Guan Yu replied flatly, his expression unreadable.

Lü Mei fell silent, thinking, *This new deskmate is so arrogant. When have I, Young Miss Lü, ever thanked anyone? How ungrateful! Hmph! But he’s… different. Every man, young or old, gazes at me with blatant desire. Why is he so cold? Could he be… impotent? What a waste of such a handsome face.*

Guan Yu could tell from Lü Mei’s eyes that his aloofness had sparked resentment in her. She was undeniably alluring, but he kept his distance for her sake. If Xue Jing—that little devil—found out he had any connection to Lü Mei, the girl would be in grave trouble. Better to stay aloof.

Yet while Guan Yu reasoned this way, Lü Mei’s thoughts took a different path. A flicker of curiosity about her new deskmate gnawed at her. She wanted to understand Guan Yu better, to unravel what kind of person he truly was.

*Ugh! Why am I even thinking about some stranger? He’s nothing special. Hmph!* Lü Mei mentally scolded herself, cutting off the train of thought.

More classmates trickled back into the room. By now, Han Qiao’s bleeding had stopped. He staggered to his feet and roared at Guan Yu, “You bastard! I challenge you!”

A challenge?

The class erupted in gasps. Many students buzzed with anticipation, eager for drama. Some immediately posted updates on WeChat and Weibo: *Hercules Han Qiao challenges newcomer Guan Yu!* The news exploded with likes and reposts. The school hadn’t seen a formal duel in ages.

Across City A’s universities, an unofficial tradition prevailed: anyone could issue a one-on-one challenge. The challenged rarely refused, as challengers typically targeted those stronger than themselves.

Challenging someone weaker was considered bullying and earned contempt.

To everyone’s eyes, Guan Yu clearly outmatched Han Qiao. The duel was set for after school—public, in the basketball gym.

Challenges came in two forms: public, open to spectators, or private, with outcomes kept secret.

“I accept,” Guan Yu said dismissively. “But why wait? Let’s fight now. You think waiting till after school will magically give you three heads and six arms?”

Han Qiao glared venomously before being helped away by four classmates.

“Are you really going through with this?” Lü Mei asked softly, aware of Han Qiao’s prowess. Perhaps Guan Yu’s earlier victory had been a fluke.

“Worried about me?” Guan Yu countered.

“Of course not!”

“You *are* worried.”

“I’m not! I’m not!” Lü Mei refused to admit it, her cheeks flushing.

“Don’t get any ideas about me,” Guan Yu warned.

“Shameless! As if I would!” Yet Lü Mei’s heart fluttered uneasily after the retort.

A hand tapped Guan Yu’s shoulder. He turned to see a chubby, dimple-cheeked classmate radiating a goofy charm.

“Hey, Brother Guan! I’m Wei Hongwei. Everyone calls me ‘Wei Ge’ (Big Brother Wei). You’re legendary! Taking down Han Qiao and winning a smile from our beauty Lü Mei? You’re Kaihuang High’s luckiest man! Take me as your underling—I’ll follow you anywhere!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “‘Wei Ge’? That’s a bold name. No need for underlings. Why not just be friends?”

“Deal! Being pals has perks. I’m City A’s ‘Jianghu’—nothing happens here without me knowing. My intel’s rock-solid.”

“Oh? Such a vast network? Then we’re definitely friends.”

“Brother Guan, listen—Han Qiao’s no joke. His dad’s a vice-minister in the International Diplomatic Association. Loaded and connected. Crossing him won’t end well,” Wei Hongwei cautioned.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Do I look scared? I’m just bored and craving excitement.”

**Chapter 1779: Taste**

“Love your style, Brother Guan! But tonight’s duel… Han Qiao might cheat. Knowing him, even if he loses, he’ll scheme behind your back.”

“Relax. I won’t give him the chance.”

As Guan Yu spoke, someone entered the classroom—Xue Jing, here to seek him out in Class 1.

“Ah! Is this Sister-in-Law Guan? I’ll get out of your way!” Wei Hongwei quipped before darting off.

Xue Jing stormed in, shouting, “Which blind worm dared challenge my man? Tired of living?”

The class buzzed. *Wow! The little beauty’s back! Guan Yu’s living the dream!*

Guan Yu massaged his temples. “Could you at least *try* to sound refined? You’re a young lady, not a mountain shrew.”

“Hehe! I’m just angry for you! Which class is this Han Qiao in? I’ll settle him now!”

“Enough. I’ll handle it. Stay out of this.”

“Fine. Whatever you say, darling.”

Guan Yu grimaced. “Ugh, the sappiness. Get back to class.”

As Xue Jing skipped off, Lü Mei overheard every word. *‘My man.’ ‘Darling.’ They’re already so close? No wonder he’s cold to me—he’s got such a pretty girlfriend.*

Lü Mei discreetly glanced down at herself. *Am I less than her? My figure, skin, looks—I’m her equal. Why is he so indifferent? Can any man truly resist temptation?*

In her experience, all men were lustful and fickle. If one wasn’t, it was due to psychological issues… or *physical* ones. A man’s disinterest meant either fear or lack of opportunity.

*Any man would want a beauty like me. How is Guan Yu immune? Is he henpecked? But from their conversation, his girlfriend seems to dote on him.*

During the afternoon’s first class—another homeroom session—Guan Yu observed the teacher’s gaze lingering on Lü Mei. When their eyes met, the man shamelessly flirted, repulsing her.

“Class, solve the problem on the board. Ten minutes,” the teacher instructed. As students bent over their work, the man strolled the aisles, fiddling with his smartphone.

He paused behind Lü Mei. Guan Yu noticed the teacher’s lecherous eyes drilling into her neckline—and the phone’s rear camera angled straight at her chest.

Remembering Wei Hongwei’s claims of omniscience, Guan Yu scribbled a note: *When did our teacher join Kaihuang? Give me his info.* He tossed it to Wei Hongwei.

Minutes later, a paper ball hit Guan Yu’s foot. Unfolding it, he read: *Boss, it’s the 21st century! Text me next time—my phone’s got everything from world wars to lost cats. No need for risky notes!*

Guan Yu muttered, “I don’t have a phone.”

The note continued: *Teacher Liu Shuowei, 39. Joined Kaihuang a week ago. Former professor. Married a 40-something ‘tigress’—daughter of the Education Bureau chief. No kids. Past scandals: molested a rural girl (fined, no jail); tried seducing a student (father intervened). Preys on young girls. Backed by powerful connections beyond his father-in-law. More details later.*

Guan Yu’s suspicions solidified. The teacher was a predator—and Lü Mei his current target.

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, the teacher had noticed him retrieving the note. Now looming behind, Liu Shuowei read over his shoulder.

Wei Hongwei watched helplessly, sweat beading.

“Finished, Guan Yu?” The teacher’s voice made Lü Mei jump.

Guan Yu grinned sheepishly. “Yep! Fascinating stuff!”

The teacher snatched the note. As he read, his chest heaved with rage.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu grabbed the phone left on his desk. The screen lit to reveal a crystal-clear photo of Lü Mei’s cleavage—white bra edging into frame.

**Chapter 1780: The Photo That Wasn’t**

Without hesitation, Guan Yu shoved the phone at Lü Mei. She gasped, hands flying to cover her chest.

Such a photo could make someone rich if sold campus-wide.

As the teacher prepared to erupt, Guan Yu stood. “Sir, your photography skills are impressive! Class, come see what’s on our teacher’s phone!”

He paraded the screen around. Students crowded, shrieking and laughing.

“Guan Yu! You jerk!” Lü Mei screamed through tears.

*Slap!*

Caught off guard, Guan Yu took the full force of her palm. Lü Mei fled the room sobbing.

Belatedly, Guan Yu realized his mistake: exposing her intimate photo. Such humiliation could drive a girl to despair—and he’d be culpable.

He glanced at Wei Hongwei, who gave a thumbs-up of awed respect.

Guan Yu smashed the phone on the floor. “If anyone spreads this photo, they won’t see tomorrow’s sun!”

His voice, infused with residual cultivation energy, struck like a physical blow. The class froze, his threat searing into their minds.

This was damage control—protecting Lü Mei’s reputation at all costs.

The teacher finally recovered, simpering, “This… must never be discussed. Dismissed early.” He eyed the phone debris mournfully.

“I’ll buy you a new one,” Guan Yu offered.

“Unnecessary. I can afford it.” Liu Shuowei hurried out.

Outside, Lü Mei regretted slapping Guan Yu. Her rage was directed at the teacher, not him. She’d noticed the lecherous glances but never imagined covert photos.

She hoped the matter would die quietly. Public scandal would only deepen her shame.

Guan Yu wanted to apologize but pride stalled him. *A mere girl. The photo didn’t show anything vital. Why the hysterics? Though her skin really is milky smooth…*

When class resumed, Lü Mei returned, head low. No one breathed a word.

During lessons, she slid a note to Guan Yu: *Sorry.*

He wrote back: *A slap and just ‘sorry’? My face still stings. I’ll need a hospital checkup—see if my looks are ruined.*

Lü Mei reddened, scribbling: *Should’ve slapped you more! Handsome face ≠ free pass. You’re just a brute!* She slammed the note on his desk, drawing the teacher’s ire.

Guan Yu smirked, adding: *What if I leak your ‘bunny’ photo tomorrow? You’ll go viral—more famous than any star. Shouldn’t you thank me in advance?*

Lü Mei’s quill nearly snapped.
