“A plan? Of course I have one. I won’t dwell on empty talk about unity. The Demon Sect suffered heavy losses in the Ancestral Realm this time. Given their nature, it’s impossible for them not to retaliate. In the cultivation world, they’re unlikely to stir much trouble. But in the mortal realm, we must be vigilant. If the Demon Sect truly unleashes its fury, the destructive force will be catastrophic. While precautions are necessary, I believe the best strategy is to lure the snake out of its hole.” Guan Yu paused, realizing he needed time to organize his thoughts on the finer details.

“Lure them out? Heh, Brother Guan,” Ye Qingfeng chuckled dryly, “Aren’t you the one they most desire to eliminate? Willing to be the bait?” His tone dripped with skepticism.

“Why not? But let me make this clear: those who wish to participate must demonstrate sincerity. Greater risks yield greater rewards. What say you all?” Guan Yu smiled faintly. This plan served dual purposes—sharing the burden of the Demon Sect’s retaliation while ensuring profit without loss.

As for danger? When he’d beaten Qingtian like a dog, he’d known the coming storm would be overwhelming. Risk was inevitable.

“The main battleground will remain in the mortal realm. The Demon Sect needs time to mobilize. We still have a preparation window. Let our elders devise specifics. Brother Ye, I don’t represent White Cloud Temple’s stance here, but I’ll declare this: the Demon-Slaying Campaign is a life-or-death struggle for our righteous path’s survival. So long as it aligns with righteousness, I, Guan Yu, will not shirk my duty!” He thumped his chest resoundently. Empty boasts cost nothing, but the gesture mattered—and if it trapped Ye Qingfeng in the process, all the better.

“Brother Guan, debts of gratitude need no words. If you ever require my aid, simply ask. Farewell.” After the meeting, Guan Yu had metaphorically slapped Kunlun Sect across the face. Ye Qingfeng departed lividly, his sister Qingling trailing pitifully. Zhang Ziran and others soon bid farewell too. Having survived the Ancestral Realm’s perils, all present had forged bonds, with Zhang and Guan growing closest—their parting tinged with reluctance.

Half a month later, White Cloud Temple’s mountain gates.

“Husband, go without worries. Master Wild Crane will protect us here.” The usually fiery Dongfang Huowu surprised Guan Yu with gentle reassurance. Her single sentence warmed his heart—these women had endured much hardship following him.

“Stay here peacefully. The mountain’s abundant spiritual energy allows Grandfather and the elders to cultivate longevity methods. Studying under my master could extend their lives decades.” In fifteen days, Guan Yu had only managed to relocate his closest kin. Others remained beyond his care.

After final arrangements, Guan Yu departed. With Master Wild Crane guarding the mountain’s formations, even a full Demon Sect assault would meet certain death.

Free from rear-guard concerns, Guan Yu relaxed slightly. Though the Demon Sect lay quiet, he knew this was the calm before the storm. Let them come—they’d settle this in battle.

Arriving by plane at Ninghai, the designated meeting point, Guan Yu surveyed the cosmopolitan city—epicenter of the coming conflict. Here, he’d command the righteous alliance’s combined economic forces: the Dongfang, Liu, Wen, and other clans poised to cripple a Demon Sect front.

“You’re certain the Song Family is their proxy?” Frowning at intelligence from Bao and Liao Yuntian, Guan Yu struggled to process the revelation.

“Not exactly a proxy,” Liao corrected, “The Songs collaborated with the Demon Sect generations ago. Under the old patriarch, they severed ties. But now that he’s dying and the family weakens, Song Shaoqin has reconnected them to the Demon Sect’s Yin Kui Faction. Our enemies now include the Songs.”

“Regardless of past sins, their foundations remain. Even if we win, the Songs can’t survive here. Fleeing under Demon Sect protection is their best outcome. Shaoqin’s blinded by hatred.” Lin Dong sighed nearby.

“Enough sentiment. Li Xi will lead economic strategies. Xi’er,” Guan Yu turned to her, “I’m leaving two guards. Be cautious. Those courting death needn’t be stopped.” Cold glinted in his eyes. Previously, Shaoqin’s status shielded him—but post-battle, Guan Yu would gladly settle old scores.

“Go safely. I’ll manage things here.” Li Xi squeezed his hand. This was total war—economic and martial. She rejoiced at being his sole tangible support.

After embracing her, Guan Yu exited the nondescript high-rise. Outside waited Ye Qingfeng, Fa Neng, Zuo Qingyi, and Zhang Ziran.

“Brother Guan’s romantic entourage grows impressive.” Ye’s neutral tone crackled with tension.

“It’s no secret—even Qingling knows. Brother Ye, focus your energy on our true enemies.” Guan Yu smiled, unperturbed. Ye’s bruised ego was understandable, but harping on his sister’s affections grew tiresome.

“The alliance agreed to Brother Guan’s mortal realm command,” Zhang Ziran interjected. “If Kunlun—freshly purged and weakened—wants a share of spoils, mind your tone.”

“You—!” Ye’s sword hissed from its scabbard.

“Seeking combat? I’ve longed to strike you since the Ancestral Realm!” Zhang’s fingers danced, summoning purple talismans.

“Fight after the war!” Guan Yu snapped. “Internal strife now is shameful. Withdraw if unwilling!” Privately, he’d replace Ye, but Qingling’s plea stayed him—this campaign could secure Ye’s future as Kunlun’s leader.

Snorts echoed, but both rivals cooled under Guan Yu’s glacial gaze. They realized their fates now hinged on this man.

**Chapter 1172: Intimate Encounters With the Demon Sect (Part 2)**

At a Ninghai villa, righteous sects’ elite gathered—the first major clash in decades. The resurgent Demon Sect, emboldened by Ancestral Realm events, sought to test their rebuilt strength.

“We’ll coordinate with Dragon Group to purge the Demon Sect’s mortal assets. Listen carefully to assignments...” Guan Yu deployed forces. The alliance was loose—hunting demonic cultivators brought both mortal and cultivation rewards.

“Voice objections now. Once orders are taken, fulfill them absolutely.” This was as much a training exercise as a culling—crisis revealed true talent.

“Question.” A sneering voice arose—predictably from Carefree Sect, still bitter over Liu Rushui’s affairs. “What penalties await failures?”

“Rewards and punishments follow established rules—set by elders, not me. Next time, read the materials before wasting our time. Move out!” Guan Yu cut off further dissent. Patience with these provocateurs wore thin.

Midnight found Guan Yu outside a suburban villa compound. With him stood Liao Yuntian, Bao, Lin Dong (now mid Spirit Silence Stage), and perimeter police.

“Five Golden Core experts inside—Yin Kui’s Ninghai stronghold. I’ll draw them away. Handle the twelve Spirit Silence guards until I return. Understood?” Guan Yu stretched, readying for combat.

“Problem: leave those twelve to us three. Only intervene if we’re losing.” Liao’s solemnity showed no jest.

“Such ambition! Lin Dong—first cultivation battle. How’s the weapon I gave you?” Guan Yu smiled, approving this trial by fire. Strong allies meant less future burdens.

“Grateful, Brother, but I’ll rise in this world—no lifelong mediocrity!” Lin Dong’s fingers danced with a dagger—a Golden Core artifact, Guan Yu realized with surprise.

“Then let’s begin. Stay sharp, brothers.”

“DEMON SCUM! FACE JUDGMENT!”

CRASH! Guan Yu’s gravity manipulation demolished the villa. Thirty shadows fled the rubble—five charging him.

“Who dares challenge Yin Kui?!” Six Golden Core elders froze at the sight of his violet blade.

“Dead men need no answers.” Guan Yu flicked his sword, purple light flashing.

“Arrogant—!” Their shouts died as he vanished. Six blade chimes rang as one—the weakest elder bleeding from his mouth.

“Third Brother, BEWARE!” Too late—Guan Yu materialized behind the injured elder. Seven strikes later, a head flew—eyes wide with fury.

**Chapter 1173: Intimate Encounters With the Demon Sect (Part 3)**

“THIRD BROTHER!” The remaining elders’ eyes reddened. Four nodded grimly—one chanting seals while three lunged suicidally.

“United till death? You lack the qualifications.” Guan Yu’s icy calm belied the peril. Each strike demanded full exertion.

His sword held two elders at bay through telekinesis. The third closed in, fist glowing darkly.

“He avoids close combat—press him!” The trapped duo redoubled efforts.

“BING!” Guan Yu’s mantra blast made the weakest elder stagger, ears bleeding.

“Seven Stars Piercing Heaven!” Seven sword clones rained down. Explosions masked Guan Yu’s teleport behind Third Brother.

“DARE YOU?!”

“THIRD—!”

A flash. A head soared. Rage frozen mid-snarl.
