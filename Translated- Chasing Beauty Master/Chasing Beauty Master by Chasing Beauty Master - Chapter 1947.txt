Gritting through the pain, the wolf leader raised its head and let out a piercing howl. The remaining wolves immediately abandoned their positions around Qiqi's group and swiftly gathered around their alpha. Clearly preparing to retreat, they formed protective ranks with the gray wolves keeping watchful eyes on Guanyu while backing away.

Guanyu made no move to pursue. If they withdrew permanently, he saw no need for further slaughter. Though aware of the wolf king's grievous injuries from Leisure Island's harsh trials, exterminating this battle-scarred ruler would demand excessive energy. Moreover, bloodshed was never his preference.

He stood motionless until the last wolf disappeared beyond the horizon. Only then did he rush to check on Qiqi, Wang Xiaorong, and the others. "Qiqi, are you unharmed?" His eyes urgently scanned her figure for injuries, ready to administer treatment.

"Truly fine," Qiqi replied with a strained smile, though her blood-splattered appearance belied the claim. Without bathing facilities, she could only change clothes and wipe herself down roughly.

Wang Xiaorong interjected, "Our heroine here stood guard like a warrior queen! Had she not barred those beasts' path..." Duan Ruxue nodded, adding, "The way she brandished that sword before the pack – no mere girl, but a heroine from legend!"

Qiqi's cheeks flushed crimson under the praise. "The credit belongs to Guanyu's gift – this magnificent Fairy Sword made all possible!"

"Even the finest blade needs worthy hands," Guanyu countered warmly. "You've drawn out its latent power through skill."

By midnight's depth, the group settled back into their tents. At dawn, young Tang arrived on horseback for updates. Guanyu handed him silver ingots. "For the men. Maintain half-day's distance still, but close the gap as we near Eastern Sea's vicinity."

Their journey wound through jagged peaks – some piercing clouds, others mere grassy knolls. Lush forests alternated with barren stone cliffs as bestial cries echoed through the crisp mountain air. Where carriages couldn't pass, Duan Ruxue and Jiang Yuankai reluctantly mounted horses.

"Finding Pagoda Mountain in this maze..." Jiang muttered.

"Hold northeast course," Duan Ruxue advised. "Beyond it lies Eastern Sea's basin – not true ocean, but a vast inland lake whose waters eternally churn like tidal seas."

Guanyu observed, "No wonder Eastern Sea remains isolated. These hundred-mile highlands challenge even seasoned travelers, let alone common folk." His mount ambled easily compared to others' labored progress.

By nightfall, Guanyu's instincts prickled with unseen observers. They camped on high ground – clear sightlines against threats. Qiqi practiced sword forms by firelight, energy undimmed by day's trek. "Youth's vigor!" Guanyu marveled as others collapsed exhausted.

Dawn revealed their landmark – Pagoda Mountain's tiered silhouette clawing the sky. What seemed nearby took full day's grueling climb. At its base, Guanyu declared camp. While gathering firewood, Wang Xiaorong's scream tore through twilight:

"Snakes! Everywhere!"

Guanyu soared aloft, stomach lurching at the nightmare below – hillsides rippling with countless serpents converging on their camp. Wang Xiaorong cowered behind magical shields, paralyzed by ophidiophobia.

"Burn the mountain!" Guanyu roared. Torches met tinder as flames leapt through dry brush. "We fly – now!"

Straining their nascent levitation skills, the party escaped skyward – Guanyu bearing Qiqi and Jiang Yuankai, Wang Xiaorong dragging Duan Ruxue. They crash-landed at Pagoda Mountain's far side, supplies and mounts lost to the inferno.

**Chapter 5118: Hunted in Shadows**

Gasping from exertion, Guanyu wiped sweat from his brow. "Safe... for now." Wang Xiaorong's face retained ghostly pallor, while Duan Ruxue shivered recounting the serpentine tide.

Their predicament deepened – no provisions, exposed to elements, stalked by unseen watchers. As Qiqi practiced sword drills to distract from hunger, Guanyu's instincts prickled again. Enemies lurked in these crags, their intentions veiled as morning mist.

Every snapped twig became imagined threat. Survival now depended on reaching Eastern Sea's churning waters – and whatever ancient secrets roiled beneath its restless surface.
