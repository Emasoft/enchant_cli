Along the walls on both sides stood an array of bizarre Buddhist statues. These deities, resembling those seen on television, each bore distinct postures, expressions, and wielded different ritual implements. Of course, for someone like Guan Yu visiting a temple for the first time, these figures remained utterly unfamiliar.

Though the main hall was spacious, its sparse furnishings lent an air of emptiness.

Guan Yu surveyed the four monks present. The bearded one could be dismissed at a glance—a straightforward man devoid of guile, his words and actions as plain as his features.

Another monk sported a close-cropped head of hair, appearing the youngest of the group. His delicate, unremarkable features gave him the look of an ordinary youth.

The third monk’s bloated frame betrayed a life of excess. His oily, bald scalp bore six cigarette burns, his thick lips protruding above a neck swallowed by fat. Guan Yu marveled inwardly: *How does vegetarian temple fare produce such corpulence? This is clearly the bulk of meat and wine—he must be sneaking indulgences behind closed doors.*

The last monk appeared relatively normal—petite and the shortest of the group, his shaved head barely half the size of the fat monk’s.

After the group settled, Wei Hongwei eagerly announced, “Boss, let me introduce everyone. The tall, bearded elder here is Yuan Shan, the oldest among us. We call him ‘Big Beard.’ This one with the trimmed hair is You Bai, the youngest. Everyone refers to him as ‘Little Bai.’

“You’d never guess—this portly brother is actually Little Bai’s blood sibling! They don’t resemble each other, do they? But they’re truly brothers. His name is You Guang.”

As Wei Hongwei spoke, Guan Yu studied the pair. Finding no familial resemblance, he thought: *These can’t be true brothers. One’s clearly from a different mother.* But he kept this to himself, merely nodding politely as each monk bowed in greeting.

“Lastly,” Wei Hongwei continued, “this is Shen Sheng, acting abbot of Houyuan Temple. He holds the highest rank among us.”

After introductions, Guan Yu inquired, “Does the temple still host many outsiders? I’ve heard numerous visitors are flocking to A City for the treasure map, with some preferring rural lodging over urban chaos.”

Shen Sheng replied, “Not many remain. A few arrived recently, but most have since departed. Only one guest stays now.”

“So such a vast temple houses just your group?” Guan Yu pressed. “How do you manage upkeep?”

“There’s little to maintain,” Shen Sheng explained. “We have junior acolytes handle essential cleaning. Much of the compound lies abandoned due to scarce occupancy. When guests arrive, we lodge them in east or west wings with basic tidying.”

At that moment, a young acolyte under twenty entered, bearing two water pots. Trembling, the boy placed one before Guan Yu and the other near the monks before scurrying away like a startled hare.

Noticing the server’s nervousness, Guan Yu shot Xue Jing a meaningful glance. With forced cheer, he told Wei Hongwei, “You’ve talked enough—have some water. Mountain springs here must taste exquisite.”

As Guan Yu handed Wei Hongwei a cup, his true purpose went unspoken: testing for poison. If the monks had drugged the water, they’d likely taken antidotes beforehand. Wei Hongwei, unprotected, would reveal the truth. With Xue Jing present to counter any toxins, Guan Yu deemed the risk manageable.

Big Beard chuckled, “Young Wang’s learning manners—knew to bring water for guests.”

“Boss, you’ve got to try this!” Wei Hongwei gulped his portion. “Sweetest water you’ll ever—”

The cup shattered as dizziness struck. Wei Hongwei collapsed, pupils dilating. Across the room, the four monks swayed before crumpling to the floor.

“He’s been drugged!” Xue Jing confirmed after checking pulses. “A sedative, non-lethal.”

Bafflement crossed Guan Yu’s face—why would the monks poison themselves? His suspicions turned to the trembling acolyte. Remembering Big Beard’s comment about “Young Wang,” he realized the water hadn’t been the monks’ order.

“Play along,” Guan Yu whispered to Xue Jing. They feigned collapse, Guan Yu cushioning himself on Wei Hongwei’s bulk while Xue Jing lay across him.

Twenty minutes passed before hurried footsteps approached. Peeking through slitted eyes, Guan Yu recognized the acolyte’s worn cloth shoes. The boy checked each body before dialing a number:

“All seven are out cold in the main hall... Three newcomers I don’t recognize... You promised payment!... You can’t renege now!”

As the acolyte cursed the swindler, new footsteps echoed. A raspy voice crowed in triumph: “Hah! Guan Yu himself—snared like a common fool! With you as leverage, that treasure map is mine!”

The intruder bore a metallic wolf’s claw prosthesis—trademark weapon of Jiang Yue, alias “Skywolf,” among the Ten Great Villains. Once a humble butcher, Jiang Yue’s tragic past had birthed this merciless predator.

Guan Yu’s mind raced: *Skywolf never acts without motive. If he wants the map... but why involve temple acolytes?* Maintaining his ruse, he awaited the villain’s next move, Xue Jing’s steady breath against his back signaling readiness.
