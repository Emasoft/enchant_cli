After notifying Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei to prepare for the client reception, Guan Yu contemplated how the three million ransom could refurbish their base – this abandoned construction site's remoteness and spaciousness made it ideal. The remaining funds would purchase essential supplies and ten commercial vehicles (around 200,000 each) for the Yu Gang's operations, eliminating their reliance on borrowed or hired cars.

Arriving at the western district stronghold, Jia Bo reported, "Boss, we've hidden Gao Bing. If they try anything, he's dead." Guan Yu nodded, "Keep our men concealed. We'll act according to circumstances when they arrive."

Answering his ringing phone, Guan Yu demanded, "Taking so long – planning tricks?" The same haughty female voice replied, "What tricks could I play redeeming someone? I'm already in the west district. Where do we meet?"

After Jia Bo's confirming nod through surveillance reports (two vehicles – unlicensed black sedan and white Mercedes sports car, no police involvement), Guan Yu instructed, "Follow the unmarked black sedan ahead."

Upon confirming safety, Guan Yu allowed their approach. Engine roars announced the vehicles' arrival. Jia Bo opened the gates as Guan Yu sat enthroned on a massive chair, Xue Jing vigilantly scanning for threats beside him.

A white sports car parked at the entrance followed by a van disgorging eight black-suited men. From the sports car emerged a statuesque woman in form-fitting black combat gear, her wavy hair cascading over shoulders as she entered with regal bearing flanked by bodyguards. Her obsidian eyes swept the warehouse before locking onto Guan Yu. "You're Guan Yu?"

Smiling, Guan Yu confirmed, "Indeed. Though I wonder why Fang Su sent a woman. What's your relation to him?"

"That's none of your concern. Where's Gao Bing?" retorted Fang Ding imperiously.

Guan Yu's gaze lingered on the suitcase in a bodyguard's grip. "The money?"

"Right here," Fang Ding gestured. The guard presented the case. "I'll see Gao Bing first. Exchange simultaneously."

At Guan Yu's snap, two subordinates brought forward a hooded, handcuffed figure. Fang Ding protested, "How do I know this isn't a fake? Remove the hood!"

Chuckling, Guan Yu countered, "Miss Fang Ding, can't you recognize your own uncle and family steward's voice?"

Fang Ding stiffened at her exposed identity. "How...?"

"After we conclude business, I'll gladly explain," Guan Yu smirked cryptically.

Testing, Fang Ding called, "Steward Gao! How old is my mother this year?"

"Forty-one, Madam Fang," the muffered voice answered correctly. Satisfied, Fang Ding nodded. Guan Yu had the hood removed, revealing Gao Bing's unharmed face – to Fang Ding's surprise given his clean appearance despite torn clothes.

"Thank you for rescuing me, Young Miss," Gao Bing said emotionally.

"Thank my brother," Fang Ding coldly replied.

Rising, Guan Yu pressed, "You've seen him. Now show the money."

Wary in enemy territory, Fang Ding negotiated, "Release him first. I'll open it then."

"Agreed," Guan Yu waved. As Jia Bo moved to object, Guan Yu overruled, "Miss Fang keeps her word. We don't bully women."

Freed, Gao Bing warily approached. "Take him," Fang Ding ordered two bodyguards. Watching them leave unhindered, she finally opened the case before Wei Hongwei's meticulous inspection – bills dumped out to verify no false bottoms.

"Genuine," Wei Hongwei confirmed.

"Pleasure doing business," Guan Yu smiled. "Convey this to Fang Su: avoid conflicts with Yu Gang. Next time, three million won't suffice."

"I'm no messenger," Fang Ding retorted, turning to leave.

"Wait!" Guan Yu produced a recorder via Jia Bo. Bodyguards tense, they passed it to Fang Ding.

Driving home, she played Gao Bing's confession about Fang family's frozen dumpling fraud using cardboard fillings – a scandal threatening their nationwide supermarket chain.

Rushing home, Fang Ding found Gao Bing being berated by her father: "Foolish provocation! Losing face and three million!"

Upstairs, she confronted brother Fang Su with the damning evidence as Guan Yu's voice taunted from the recorder: "Interested in more stories?" The game had only begun.
