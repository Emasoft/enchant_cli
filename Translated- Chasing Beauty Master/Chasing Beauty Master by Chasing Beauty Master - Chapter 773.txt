“Although they are biological sisters, everyone knows they have always been inseparable ‘best buddies.’ In the past, Wang Jun even posted photos of them sharing a bed in their classmate group chat.

Wang Jun’s older sister, Wang Ying, is two years her senior. Upon hearing her sister had fallen for a man—despite the two often ‘solving problems’ together in the past—Wang Ying couldn’t sit idly by. Fuming, she tracked down Guan Yu and stormed over.

“Sister, why are you here?” Wang Jun asked curiously.

“Dear *younger brother*,” Wang Ying frowned, “how could you fall for this brat? Hasn’t your sister treated you well? Look at the hideous clothes he’s wearing!”

She then pointed accusingly at Guan Yu. “You shameless punk! How dare you seduce my *younger brother*? Have you no dignity? Stealing another’s man…”

Though insulted, Guan Yu found the situation absurd. “Madam,” he retorted, “explain yourself. When did I ever seduce your… *younger brother*?” The words felt awkward on his tongue.

“Sister, why are you doing this?” Wang Jun stood up, tugging at Wang Ying’s arm. “This has nothing to do with Guan Yu! Let’s discuss this at home!”

Wang Ying plopped defiantly into a chair. “Dear *younger brother*, have I wronged you? How could you betray me for a man?”

To everyone’s shock, she suddenly burst into exaggerated sobs. “Woe is me! Someone’s openly stealing my brother! Where’s the justice? I can’t go on living!”

Her theatrics drew a crowd in the restaurant. Wei Hongwei, uninterested in the drama, kept his head down, shoveling food into his mouth.

Guan Yu massaged his temples. Wang Ying resembled a backwoods harpy, and he had no clue what game she was playing.

As onlookers gathered, Wang Ying seized Guan Yu’s arm. “Judge for yourselves! This man seduced my *younger brother*! Shouldn’t such scum be executed?” Her wails crescendoed.

The crowd murmured, mistakenly assuming Wei Hongwei—still stuffing his face—was the ‘brother.’ A bystander remarked, “Your ‘brother’ seems happily eating. Maybe this isn’t so serious?”

“Shameless!” another jeered at Guan Yu. “A man chasing men? And you look decent too!”

“Youth these days have strange tastes,” someone else clucked.

Wang Ying wailed louder. “My *younger brother* is with a man! How can I face the world?”

Guan Yu bristled. *I just wanted a peaceful meal!*

A meddler approached Wei Hongwei. “Young man, if you’re her brother, why aren’t you upset?”

Wei Hongwei nearly choked. “Who said I’m her brother?!” He jabbed a finger at Wang Jun. “*That’s* her brother!”

The crowd gasped—Wang Jun was clearly female.

The busybody turned to Wang Ying. “Miss, who *is* your brother? Who’s the seducer?”

Realizing the truth would expose her taboo relationship with Wang Jun, Wang Ying panicked and pointed at Wei Hongwei. “Him! He’s my brother!”

“I—?!” Wei Hongwei flushed crimson, speechless. Guan Yu stifled a laugh—Wang Ying’s quick thinking was impressive.

“Enough!” Wang Jun shoved her sister toward the exit. Despite Wang Ying’s protests, Wang Jun’s cultivator strength overpowered her.

“Guan Yu!” Wang Ying shrieked as she was hauled out. “Stay away from my *younger brother*! He’s mine!”

Wei Hongwei, ever pragmatic, resumed eating. Guan Yu noted his table manners mirrored Zhang Han’s.

The baffled crowd dispersed. Spotting Sun Xu watching from a corner, Guan Yu approached.

“Impressive,” Sun Xu sneered. “You’ve even tamed Young Master Wang Jun. Bold tastes.”

Guan Yu’s smile chilled. “Enjoying the show? Let’s discuss your thugs attacking my men. You’ll disband your ‘Gentlemen’s Hall’—today.”

Sun Xu’s face paled. The gang, though nobly named, was a band of bullies. “I… need time to consult my members,” he stalled.

Guan Yu gripped his shoulder painfully. “Take your time. But remember—cross me, and your gang crumbles.”

Later, Wei Hongwei asked, “Will he really disband?”

“Never,” Guan Yu smirked. “But he’s powerless now.”

After school, Wang Jun intercepted Guan Yu. “I’m sorry about lunch. Let me treat you tonight!”

“Can’t. Already have plans.”

“Take me! Girlfriends should join dinners!”

“Since when are we dating?”

Wang Jun clung to his arm. “I’m yours now! Where you go, I follow!”

Bystanders gawked. The once-domineering ‘Young Master’ now fawned publicly.

“My harem’s full,” Guan Yu deflected.

“One more won’t hurt!”

“Fine. Be obedient, or I’ll cut you loose.”

As Wang Jun pouted, scheming students photoshopped Guan Yu into risqué images, spreading them online. Guan Yu tasked Wei Hongwei with stopping the sales.

That evening, Sun Xu hosted Guan Yu at a lavish restaurant. Seated with him were Sun Zhi and Li Yuan—notorious campus tyrants. A stunning girl in green sat nearby, her curves straining her dress.

“Guan Yu!” Sun Xu greeted too warmly. “Meet Bai Jiao.”

The girl’s hypnotic eyes locked onto Guan Yu. Whatever Sun Xu plotted, Guan Yu was ready.

Rumors exploded after Wang Jun’s public declaration. Entrepreneurs even sold photoshopped images of Guan Yu in compromising poses.

At dinner with Sun Xu, Guan Yu eyed the seductive Bai Jiao. Her porcelain features and voluptuous frame radiated danger. Flanked by Sun Zhi and Li Yuan, Sun Xu’s intentions were clear—but Guan Yu never backed down.

The true game was just beginning.
