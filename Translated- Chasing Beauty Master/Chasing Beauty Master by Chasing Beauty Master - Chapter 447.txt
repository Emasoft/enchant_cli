“Remove your clothes to allow your Nanming Li Fire (Southern Clarity Flame) to better integrate into her body. Hurry, or we’ll run out of time…”

Under Wan Qingyang’s incessant urging, Guan Yu had no choice but to silently recite the Heart-Cleansing Mantra while steeling himself to remove her clothes…

The process took over twenty minutes. By the end, sweat drenched Guan Yu’s brow.

Forcing himself to avert his gaze from the alluring sight before him, he asked, “What should I do now?”

“Activate the Nanming Li Fire to purge the cold energy within her. Be swift…”

To manipulate the flame properly, he couldn’t afford distraction. When Guan Yu finally looked, he gasped—the once steaming water now emitted frosty vapors, nearly freezing solid.

Realizing this was caused by Zhou Xiaoyou’s internal cold energy, Guan Yu focused completely, channeling the Nanming Li Fire with utmost precision.

This soul-searing flame demanded absolute concentration. A single misstep could doom them both. Guan Yu worked tirelessly, not daring to wipe the sweat beading his forehead.

Meanwhile, outside…

“Grandmaster Wan, will this truly work?”

Zhou Xiaochuan had assumed Wan Qingyang would personally intervene, not remain outside directing Guan Yu. His worry grew palpable.

Wan Qingyang coughed awkwardly, “Miss Youyou remains unmarried. My involvement would be improper. Moreover, Guan Yu is the ideal candidate. With proper control of his flame, saving her is certain.”

Zhou Tianci muttered bitterly, “But Guan Yu gets to take advantage of Youyou for free!”

“Silence!” Zhou Xiaochuan snapped, disgusted by his son’s shortsightedness. Guan Yu had not only defeated the Song family but was a renowned cultivator in the capital—how could he be unworthy of his granddaughter?

Unbeknownst to him, Zhou Tianci’s hostility stemmed from previous humiliation. After being slapped by Guan Yu at a hotel, instead of remorse, he’d sown discord within the family, poisoning even Zhou Xiaoyou’s parents against their benefactor.

Glaring at his son, Zhou Xiaochuan turned his attention to the cabin.

Dawn broke after a sleepless night. The Zhou family gathered anxiously outside, noting Wan Qingyang’s bloodshot eyes and grim expression.

“Grandmaster Wan, has something…?” they pressed.

Wan Qingyang sighed heavily. “Uncertain. By all calculations, they should’ve emerged by now. Unexpected complications may have arisen.”

Four days passed. The Longzu leader arrived on the fourth day, his grave expression mirroring their dread. By noon on the fifth day, as they prepared to force entry, the cabin’s roof exploded upward. Two figures hand-in-hand soared into the sky.

“Guan Yu!”

“Youyou!”

The pair landed gracefully. Wan Qingyang gasped, “You’ve advanced to the Silent Spirit Stage?!”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. Previously at the Heart Movement Stage, he’d bypassed three months of cultivation to reach Silent Spirit in mere days—a staggering pace that even drew Wan Qingyang’s envy.

Zhou Xiaoyou’s transformation proved more shocking. “Miss Zhou… you’ve reached the Fusion Stage?!”

Radiant and poised, Zhou Xiaoyou now exuded an ethereal aura. After greeting her family, she nestled against Guan Yu like a devoted wife, provoking protective glares from her parents.

Unperturbed by their hostility, Guan Yu bid farewell with newfound serenity. “Grandfather Zhou, I take my leave.”

Summoned by the Longzu leader via mental transmission, Guan Yu departed with Wan Qingyang. At Longzu headquarters, they found Wild Crane Daoist awaiting them.

“Fellow Daoist Wild Crane?” Guan Yu blinked in surprise.

The elder nodded. “Dragon Pride Sky and I share deep ties. It is I who requested your presence.”

Dragon Pride Sky interjected solemnly, “First, congratulations on gaining a Dao Companion.”

Guan Yu flushed. “How did you…?”

“Please.” The leader smirked. “I’d be worthless in the cultivation world if I couldn’t discern such bonds.” He’d witnessed their spiritual union during his vigil—the dual breakthrough that saved Zhou Xiaoyou while elevating both cultivators.

Wan Qingyang chuckled, “I merely set the stage. The affinity was yours to kindle.”

“Enough celebrations.” Dragon Pride Sky’s expression darkened. “The demonic sects stir, but worse—the three great extraterritorial sects plan to return to the mortal realm.”

Wild Crane elaborated, “Heavy Sword Palace, Cold Mountain Sect, and Carefree Pavilion—each commands thousands of disciples, hundreds at Heart Movement Stage, dozens at Silent Spirit. Their return would unleash chaos.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. “What must I do?”

“In three months,” Wild Crane declared, “the Decennial Dharma Assembly convenes. We’ll challenge them through generational combat. You’ll be our trump card among the younger disciples.”

Chapter 1118: Disciple

“Me? A trump card?” Guan Yu arched an eyebrow.

“Precisely.” Wild Crane nodded. “But you require intensive training. I offer guidance—if you’ll accept me as master.”

Without hesitation, Guan Yu knelt. “Master above, this disciple pays homage.”

Dragon Pride Sky gaped at the once-arrogant youth’s compliance. Wild Crane simply smiled. “Rise. We depart for secluded training tomorrow. Bring your Dao Companion, but no others.”

As arrangements concluded, Guan Yu visited his family and wives. Though bittersweet farewells ensued—particularly under jealous accusations of new paramours—he soothed them with vows of return.

At dawn, the group assembled: Guan Yu, Zhou Xiaoyou, Wan Qingyang, and Panther—the latter ordered by Dragon Pride Sky to strengthen himself after previous defeats.

Wild Crane surveyed them gravely. “The next three months will forge your path. What comes after… depends on your resolve.”

The mountain mists swallowed the group, their fates intertwining with the impending storm threatening both cultivation and mortal realms.
