“Since I’ve already found the person I sought, I naturally won’t trouble this young lady anymore.” With those words, the martial sister tapped the back of Qing Ling’er’s head. Ling’er let out a soft hum, her eyes regaining their brightness as she blinked twice.

Qing Ling’er seemed momentarily disoriented by the light. After a pause, her vision cleared, and she gasped, “Dad? Why are you here?” She had no idea where they were.

Uncle Qing stepped forward and gripped her arm, his voice trembling with emotion. “I’ll explain everything later. Go inside and find your mother first. I have matters to settle here.”

Ling’er turned to Guan Yu. “Brother Guan, why are you here too? Where is this place?” Then she spotted the martial sister behind her and scowled. “So it was you who brought me here. I finally understand!”

“Ling’er, go inside. Don’t worry—I’ll handle this,” Guan Yu reassured her. Nodding obediently, Ling’er retreated into the courtyard.

“Well, I’ve released the girl,” the martial sister said coldly, a long sword materializing in her hand as she pointed it at Uncle Qing. “Old fool, will you end yourself, or shall I do it?”

Guan Yu chuckled softly. “It seems your efforts tonight are wasted again. But luck is on our side, not yours. To prevent future inconveniences, I won’t let you leave easily.”

The abduction of Qing Ling’er had crossed Guan Yu’s bottom line. No longer holding back, he summoned a faint golden shield around himself, its glow unnoticed in the darkness.

Clapping his hands, Guan Yu signaled two figures to emerge behind the martial sister: Hou Jinshun and Qiong Si, a man and a woman.

Originally, Guan Yu had intended for Hou Jinshun to guard the house, but the latter insisted on confronting the martial sister. Qiong Si, however, had been summoned specifically. With Wang Shu temporarily watching over the residence, these two were the only capable fighters Guan Yu could muster. Leaving the women unprotected would have been too great a risk—enemies would surely strike if they learned of his absence.

The martial sister sensed the formidable cultivation levels of the newcomers. Guan Yu, recognizing her true form tonight, had prepared accordingly.

“Uncle Qing, stay back. Your health is poor. My friends and I can handle her,” Guan Yu advised.

Uncle Qing sighed heavily. “How tragic, junior sister. Why must you push things this far?”

“Spare me your hypocrisy, old man!” she spat. “You know exactly why we’re here! Don’t pretend to be righteous now!” She subtly gauged the distance between herself and the two behind her.

With a sneer, she retorted, “You think three of you can stop me? Dream on!” In a blur, five spectral clones materialized around her. One lunged at Uncle Qing.

But Guan Yu was faster. He interposed himself, shield flaring, and absorbed the clone’s strike. The purely energetic attack dissipated harmlessly against his defenses.

Hou Jinshun charged at the nearest clone, while Qiong Si—her perception sharp—targeted the true body. Startled, the martial sister conjured four more clones to intercept.

As Guan Yu pressed his assault, she realized the futility of the fight. Summoning a dozen clones to distract them, she tried to slip away—only for Qiong Si to anticipate her escape.

“As long as the green hills remain, there’ll be no shortage of firewood,” the martial sister muttered bitterly, preparing to flee. But a crushing force slammed into her back, shattering her internal organs. She lurched forward, blood spraying from her lips.

Wheezing, she turned to see Qiong Si behind her, the architect of the ambush. Gritting her teeth, she commanded her clones to swirl around her in a frenzied vortex. By the time the maelstrom ceased, her true form had vanished.

**Chapter 2141: Such Thick Skin**

The martial sister’s clones dissolved, leaving only emptiness. “She escaped?” Guan Yu muttered, glancing at Uncle Qing, who stood motionless, conflicted. Letting her go would bring future calamity, yet perhaps he still carried guilt for ruining her life.

Though Qiong Si’s blow had left her grievously wounded, recovery was inevitable. A problem for another day.

Uncle Qing approached gratefully. “Thank you all for your aid. It’s late—please stay the night.”

Guan Yu declined politely. “We’ll rest indoors briefly.” Inside, Ling’er rushed to them. “Brother Guan! Manager Hou! Dad! Are you all safe?”

“Thanks to Guan Yu, we’re unharmed,” Uncle Qing said, ushering them to the immaculate living room. Hou Jinshun gazed nostalgically at his former home, now lent to the Qings.

Guan Yu introduced Qiong Si as his girlfriend and Hou Jinshun as the house’s owner and Ling’er’s manager. Profuse thanks followed until Guan Yu redirected the conversation. “Your junior sister won’t return soon. Rest easy here.”

After farewells, they departed.

**Chapter 2142: The Feng Family’s Plan**

Returning to A City the next morning, Guan Yu retrieved Lan Yu and found Cao Jin and Wang Jun waiting at his gate.

Cao Jin demanded repayment for car repairs, while Wang Jun—claiming no alliance—sought Guan Yu privately. Dismissing Cao Jin’s bluster, Guan Yu focused on Wang Jun’s warning: the Feng family plotted against him.

Their conversation in a café was interrupted by an assassin’s dagger. Blocking the strike with his phone, Guan Yu shielded Wang Jun, maneuvering them both to safety.

The attacker pressed, but Guan Yu parried, his reflexes saving them. The skirmish ended with Guan Yu’s resolve steeled—new threats loomed, and vigilance was paramount.
