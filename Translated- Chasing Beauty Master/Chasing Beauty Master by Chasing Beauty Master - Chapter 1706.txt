“Let me tell you, if the whole world spoke, I’d believe them. But if Lin Chen speaks, I’ll never trust a word!” declared Ling Su.

Yet upon reflection, if there truly was a chance to capture A Mei, there’d be no need to deliver her to Lin Chen. He could simply imprison and interrogate her himself about the silver’s whereabouts. That way, he’d seize the silver first, leaving Lin Chen in the dark. Once the treasure was secured, even if Lin Chen begged, he’d get nothing.

The more he pondered, the more feasible it seemed. Ling Su clapped his junior brother’s shoulder. “All this is for your sake! Since you’ve spoken up, as your senior brother, I’ll help. I’ll wait here while you gather more disciples. We’ll hunt down that A Mei together.”

“Perfect! Thank you for your support!” The junior brother grinned and hurried off, convinced the task would be simple with Ling Su’s aid. Their combat strength alone would ensure victory.

Soon, three disciples joined Ling Su, making four in total. They stormed into the bun shop, where Ling Su roared, “Where’s A Mei? Come out, wench! Daring to harm my junior brother—do you know who we are? You’ve signed your death warrant!”

“Come out, you vile hag! Show yourself!”

Fueled by Ling Su’s fury, the junior brothers bellowed in unison. Patrons inside looked up, bewildered by the commotion.

Ling Su marched to the counter and jabbed a finger at the elderly man behind it. “Old man, we’re not here to trouble you. Hand over A Mei, and we’ll leave peacefully.”

“Gentlemen, what’s this about? We have no one named A Mei here. Surely there’s a mistake,” the old man stammered, trembling at their murderous aura.

The bun shop’s burly enforcers emerged, but Ling Su scoffed. Drawing his Yunqing Sword, he channeled spiritual energy, its blade glowing faint blue. His comrades followed suit, their swords shimmering—a clear sign they were cultivators armed with magical artifacts.

Two patrons exchanging glances recognized the Yunqing Sect’s insignia. They abandoned their meal and slipped out, uneasy at the sect’s open provocation.

“Are you causing trouble deliberately?” The old man regained some courage as his enforcers flanked him. He cared little for cultivators—troublemakers faced his wrath regardless.

Unbeknownst to him, “A Mei” was an alias. The woman’s true name was Shi Zhenxiang (Fragrant Treasure), and he knew nothing of her misdeeds.

“Enough lies!” Ling Su snarled. “Yesterday, a tall woman here nearly killed my junior brother and robbed him blind. Hand her over, or we’ll tear this place apart!” He raised his crackling sword, spiritual energy surging. His disciples readied their spells, poised to strike.

The old man paled. Cultivators of the Yunqing Sect—renowned as righteous—wouldn’t act without cause. Yet their aggression suggested grave offense. “There must be a misunderstanding,” he pleaded. “My wife is gentle—she’d never harm anyone. Let’s discuss this calmly.”

Ling Su ignored him. “My junior brother was drugged at an inn south of town. That witch stole his silver and dumped him in a mass grave. He barely escaped alive. As Yunqing disciples, we don’t make baseless accusations. Produce her, or we’ll turn this town upside down!”

He turned to the gawking crowd. “Leave now! This is a den of thieves—they poison guests and rob them! I swear this on the Yunqing Sect’s honor!”

Murmurs erupted. Some believed; others doubted. But the sect’s reputation lent weight to Ling Su’s words.

Defeated, the old man ordered a servant, “Fetch my wife. Let her confront them and clear this slander.”

The servant returned moments later, whispering, “She’s gone.”

“What? She was here earlier!” the old man sputtered.

“Likely fled with her loot!” Ling Su jeered. “Hand her over, or we demolish this shop!”

He signaled his disciples to clear the patrons. Behind his bluster, Ling Su craved the stolen five hundred taels. The old man’s protests fell on deaf ears.

“My wife is Shi Zhenxiang, not your ‘A Mei.’ When she returns, she’ll prove her innocence,” the old man insisted.

“Innocent? Then why flee?” Ling Su retorted. “Compensate us with eight hundred taels, or face the sect’s wrath!”

The sum stunned the old man. “Preposterous! She’d never take so much!”

“My junior brother carried two hundred taels, a five-hundred-tael note, and a jade pendant—all stolen! Yunqing Sect doesn’t trifle over silver, but justice must be served!”

As Ling Su invoked the sect’s name, his disciples puffed with arrogance. The old man, realizing resistance was futile, sent men to search for his wife.

Unbeknownst to them, Shi Zhenxiang had already fled through the back door upon spotting Ling Su. Regret gnawed at her—targeting a Yunqing disciple had been a fatal error. If caught, her only escape was to vanish entirely.

**Chapter 4463: No Wrongdoing**

“I’ve grown up in the Yunqing Sect,” Ling Su proclaimed, “taught by my master to never wrong others. But if provoked, we strike back! My junior brother lies bedridden—this injustice **will** be answered!”

His righteous act almost made him blush. The sect’s reputation for virtue, however hollow beneath, lent his words credence. Patrons murmured, half-convinced.

**Chapter 4464: Speaking with Pride**

“To the virtuous, we show mercy. To villains, none!” Ling Su thundered. “Hide her all you want—the Yunqing Sect will hunt her endlessly. More disciples will come. Decide wisely, old man.”

The threat hung heavy. The old man, though skeptical, knew opposing the sect meant ruin. “I’ll send men to find her. Give us time.”

“Time? Return the eight hundred taels now, or we wait here. But not for long.” Ling Su’s greed glinted beneath his facade.

Meanwhile, Shi Zhenxiang lurked in shadows, plotting her escape. Against the Yunqing Sect’s might, even her cunning might not suffice.
