“Miss, I’m not an official,” Wang Jun said. “I simply witnessed your extraordinary skills and wanted to learn from you. Please don’t misunderstand—I mean no harm.”

Her female identity had been exposed, but killing wasn’t necessary now. She just needed to intimidate him into stopping his pursuit.

“I noticed you the moment I entered the gambling den. Had you not been staring at me, I could’ve earned even more.”

“Listen—if you dare chase me again, my white dagger will plunge in and come out red. You’d better watch yourself.” The thief turned, poised to flee.

At that moment, Xiao Zhi rounded the corner, shouting, “Let that person go!”

“Stay back! One more step and I won’t hold back!” the thief snapped, her tense voice fully revealing its feminine sweetness beneath its cold edge.

Ignoring the threat, Xiao Zhi charged forward, brandishing a bronze lock. Leaping into the air, he lunged toward the thief.

“Are you trying to get me killed?!” Wang Jun yelled frantically as the dagger pressed against her neck. Xiao Zhi’s reckless charge seemed destined to doom them both.

In the darkness, Xiao Zhi had misjudged the situation. Now up close, he panicked mid-air, losing his balance and flailing helplessly.

Momentum carried him forward. The thief tensed, tightening her grip on the dagger.

Sweating profusely, Wang Jun seized the moment. Jerking her head back, she rolled away just as Xiao Zhi crashed down, flattening both women beneath him.

Unable to adjust his trajectory, Xiao Zhi landed clumsily. Wang Jun bore the brunt, gasping, “Ugh… you’re crushing me!”

Xiao Zhi, unharmed, found his hands resting on something remarkably soft. The bronze lock lay discarded nearby.

**Chapter 3991: A Swollen Face**

Xiao Zhi curiously squeezed the mysterious softness, marveling at its pliant warmth.

“AAAAHHH!!!”

A deafening, ultrasonic shriek rattled both their skulls. Dazed, Xiao Zhi shifted, allowing Wang Jun to scramble up—only to freeze.

Xiao Zhi’s hands remained firmly clasped over the thief’s chest, fingers kneading unconsciously. The thief’s dagger trembled in her grip, her face crimson with fury.

During the tumble, Xiao Zhi had pinned both women. Wang Jun kicked him urgently. “Get up! Are you waiting to die?!”

Xiao Zhi grinned sheepishly. “You okay? Didn’t crush you, right?”

“You nearly did!” Wang Jun hissed, wincing. The thief’s murderous glare puzzled her—why hadn’t she struck?

The thief could easily plunge her dagger into Xiao Zhi’s exposed back. Yet she suddenly stood, hurled the blade aside, and slapped Xiao Zhi with full force.

*SMACK!*

The blow sent Xiao Zhi sprawling, his left cheek blooming five vivid finger marks. The thief fled without a word.

“She hit me? Why?!” Xiao Zhi mumbled, dazed.

“You groped her! Consider yourself lucky she didn’t kill you!” Wang Jun retorted, clutching her own stinging cheek.

“Is my face swollen?”

Wang Jun nodded twice.

Xiao Zhi sprang up, incensed. “You just stood there?! Some friend you are!”

“You deserved it!” Wang Jun shot back, eyeing the swollen handprint. “That slap could’ve felled an ox!”

“She’s a woman?!”

“Obviously! Did you think men care about being fondled?!”

Xiao Zhi numbly picked up the abandoned dagger—ordinary, unremarkable.

“You alright?” Wang Jun asked.

“Can’t talk… hurts,” Xiao Zhi slurred.

“Let’s go. You nearly got me killed, and now you’re half-deaf. Pathetic.” Wang Jun prodded his swollen face, wincing in sympathy.

**———**

The thief, safely distant, muttered, “That flying fatty clearly knew magic. Lucky escape.” Touching her chest, she seethed. “Should’ve stabbed him.”

Checking her stolen coins, she sighed. Still insufficient for her parents’ medicine. The physician’s ultimatum echoed—pay or be evicted. Resigned, she vanished into shadows.

**———**

Xiao Zhi fiddled with the dagger, torn between resentment and an odd urge to return it. Wang Jun, amused by his pout, offered consolation: “Cheer up. One slap’s a light price for copping a feel.”

At the gambling den’s entrance, Wang Jun handed him a silver ingot. “Play a few rounds. Forget the thief.”

Xiao Zhi nodded silently, face throbbing.

**Chapter 3992: Joining the Fray**

As they turned to enter, a commotion erupted across the street.

An elderly man sat outside a brothel, drawing two circles—one labeled “Red,” the other “Blue”—with chalk. “Gather ’round! Witness my ancestral trick! Guess right, double your silver!”

“What’s this?” Xiao Zhi perked up as a crowd formed.

“Another swindler?” Wang Jun mused. They joined the onlookers.

The hat-clad old man demonstrated: looping a string around red and blue sticks. “Guess which it binds! Simple as sunrise!”

“Blue!” Wang Jin called.

The man revealed the blue stick. “Sharp eyes, young sir!”

Repeating the act, the crowd cheered correct guesses until—suddenly—the string defied expectations, landing on red.

“Bet small stakes for fun!” the man urged. Wang Jun placed a silver fragment on red—and won.

Emboldened, the crowd wagered heavier. But as stakes rose, the man began winning consistently.

Xiao Zhi, spotting the pattern, bet his entire ingot on blue. The string obliged.

“Knew it!” Wang Jun clapped his shoulder. Xiao Zhi grinned through his swollen cheek.

**Chapter 3993: Streak of Misfortune**

The game continued—the crowd’s bets growing reckless. Xiao Zhi, now invested, awaited his moment.

When all piled onto red, he shoved his silver onto blue. Wang Jun nodded approval.

The string snapped to blue. The old man groaned, paying out. Xiao Zhi’s triumph was wordless—his face still too sore for cheers.

Yet as the night wore on, the old man’s wins mounted. Wang Jun frowned—the math favored the trickster.

“Enough,” Wang Jun muttered. “He’s bleeding them dry.”

But Xiao Zhi, nursing his cheek and silver, felt fortune’s wheel might yet turn...
