“Hehe, Old Liu, no need to rush. We’re not children anymore. Before doing anything, we must think it through carefully!” Old Master Ye chuckled beside them.

Wen Shuquan, known for his fiery temper, retorted, “Think through what? Do you think my grandson-in-law is like those useless grandsons of yours?”

The elderly gentlemen exchanged awkward glances. Though they had once held immense power, their descendants paled in comparison to Guan Yu, lacking worthy successors.

The relatively younger Old Master Wu coughed lightly and cut to the chase. “Guan Yu, you surely know why you’re here today. Speak your mind.”

Old Master Shen, who had remained silent until now, added, “Brothers Wen and Liu, our decades-long bond is true, but if you want our support, we must first see if this young man is worthy.”

Wen Shuquan and Liu Jingguo grunted but offered no rebuttal.

Guan Yu remained unperturbed. At the level of these elders, decisions were never made solely on sentiment. They weighed the worthiness of causes, representing not just themselves but their entire clans and affiliated factions.

Since they were friends of the Wen and Liu families, Guan Yu saw no need for pretense. He laid out his thoughts plainly.

“Truthfully, I have no concrete plan. I can only meet challenges as they come—soldiers with arms, water with earth.”

If his earlier words to Wen Baoguo had been half in jest, Guan Yu now spoke with gravity. The situation had escalated beyond his or the Song family’s control, resting instead in the hands of higher powers.

Both sides had coalesced into formidable forces. Any collapse would trigger destabilizing repercussions—an outcome the authorities wished to avoid. Their current inaction stemmed from the conflict not yet reaching existential stakes.

In essence, this struggle would yield a victor but leave neither side utterly destroyed. At worst, minor players might become casualties. Thus, Guan Yu’s strategy of adaptability proved most prudent.

Hearing this, the elders exchanged nods of approval. The young man understood the chessboard well.

“Young man,” one asked, “if you defeat the Song family, how will you handle them?”

While the authorities would never permit total annihilation, strategic weakening was permissible. Should Song prevail, Guan Yu would merely leave the capital, his base in N City untouched—a contingency granted by higher powers. Conversely, Guan Yu would be restrained from overreach if victorious, preserving balance for stakeholders in Hong Kong’s Li family, Taiwan’s Song branch, and American interests.

Having long grasped these undercurrents, Guan Yu replied evenly, “The Song family would serve better as an ordinary commercial dynasty.”

Old Masters Wen and Liu bristled at this perceived timidity, but Zhou and Shen burst into laughter, baffling the others.

“What’s so amusing?” Old Master Ye demanded.

“Elders,” Zhou remarked, shaking his head, “you’ve grown out of touch. This young man sees clearer than decades-seasoned veterans!”

As the most recently retired and influential among them, Zhou had closely monitored the conflict. He recognized it as the authorities’ ploy to use Guan Yu in curbing Song’s excesses. Among mainland clans rivaling Song’s scale—like the Eastern and Tan families—none matched Song’s arrogance, emboldened by their overseas connections to flout national interests.

The higher-ups had tolerated this for diplomatic reasons, but Guan Yu’s clash presented the perfect catalyst. Initial doubts about his capability dissolved when Taiwan’s Song and Hong Kong’s Li factions joined the fray, confirming his viability. Unbeknownst to many, authorities had covertly aided Guan Yu—without such support, his allies in Taiwan would have been eradicated.

**Chapter 1078: Divine Physician Guan Yu**

Guan Yu’s post-Taiwan composure stemmed from this understanding, allowing him leisure to accompany his lovers shopping.

“With such an opponent, Song’s defeat is inevitable!” Shen marveled. The youth’s insight outshone veterans, marking him as exceptional.

While some remained confused, Zhou cut through: “This young man is worth backing. Assist him, and you’ll reap benefits.”

Military-man Wu agreed bluntly: “If Zhou vouches for him, that’s enough.”

Though Wen and Liu still fumed, their objective was achieved—Guan Yu had secured support.

Suddenly, Shen addressed Guan Yu gravely: “Remember—no matter your stature, never harm the nation.”

“Understood,” Guan Yu affirmed.

Zhou lightened the mood: “Now, lighter matters. Guan Yu, Wen claims you possess medical prowess?”

All eyes turned to him. The revitalized Wen and Liu had attributed their vigor to Guan Yu’s treatments, sparking curiosity. These patriarchs sought not immortality but time to nurture worthy successors.

Before Guan Yu could respond, Wen crowed: “See? Doubted me, yet now you inquire!”

Guan Yu inwardly sighed—resurrection myths aside, he clarified: “My skills are modest, but I’ll assist where possible.”

At Liu’s urging, Zhou requested diagnosis: “Young Master Guan, what ails me?”

“Grandfather Zhou,” Guan Yu deferred politely, “you suffer minor headaches and intermittent hypertension. Grandfather Ye’s condition is graver—his organs are failing. Without treatment, he has perhaps a year.”

The blunt prognosis startled listeners, but Ye—a battle-scarred veteran given six months by doctors—laughed ruefully: “Accurate. I’ve made peace with it.”

Wen gaped: “Old Ye, you never said—”

Ye waved him off: “At our age, what’s left to fear?”

A somber silence fell until Guan Yu interjected: “Despair is premature. I can extend your life seven or eight decades.”

“Eight years?” Ye scoffed. “Kind lies, boy.”

“Traditional Chinese medicine’s peak could revive the dead. Though much is lost, I retain enough to help.”

At Wen and Liu’s insistence, Guan Yu treated Ye privately. Thirty minutes later, they emerged—Ye rejuvenated, staff astounded.

“How?” his physician gasped.

“Eight Trigrams Acupuncture,” Guan Yu revealed, sparking the doctor’s awestruck plea to learn this legendary technique.

As Guan Yu agreed to teach him, other elders sought treatments. Zhou hesitated before requesting: “Could you examine my granddaughter? Her condition… is peculiar.”

“Peculiar how?”

Zhou sighed. “Come tomorrow. You’ll understand.”

**Chapter 1079: The Li Family Arrives**

Mission accomplished, Guan Yu returned with Wen and Liu.

“Help Zhou’s granddaughter if you can,” Wen urged cryptically.

Though curious about the secrecy, Guan Yu simply nodded.

That evening, as Guan Yu sought his lovers’ company, a summons from Dongfang Mu interrupted—a meeting at the Imperial Academy Club.

There, amidst curious onlookers whispering about the man who shook the capital, Guan Yu entered a VIP room. Beside Dongfang Mu and Jiang Ziqi sat an unremarkable-looking man exuding latent authority—Lee Ze Kai, vice-chairman of Ze Ya Industries and brother to Asia’s “Little Giant.”

“So you’re Guan Yu,” Lee rumbled. “Let’s dispense with pleasantries. Cease your conflict with the Songs.”

“Why?” Guan Yu countered coolly.

An underling snapped: “When Chairman Lee commands, you obey!”

The air crackled with tension.
