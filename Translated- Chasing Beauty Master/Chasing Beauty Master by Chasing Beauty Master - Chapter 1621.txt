Guan Yu’s body and face were smeared with blood, and the Soulfall Blade in his hand dripped crimson. After this grueling battle, he was utterly exhausted. Yet he had shown no mercy—every Imperial Guard who charged at him met a swift, fatal strike. No survivors were left.

This time, Guan Yu intended to teach them a harsh lesson. Until now, whenever the Imperial Guards came to target Prince Zou, Guan Yu had refrained from lethal force, offering chances to retreat. But such leniency had only emboldened their arrogance.

Thus, he resolved to deliver a brutal message: a massacre. However many Imperial Guards they sent, he would slaughter them all—no exceptions. Even if it meant annihilating the entire force, Guan Yu would not hesitate. After this, the Imperial Guards would surely think twice before acting recklessly.

The staggering casualties would cripple their operations. Any future attempts to harm Prince Zou would require careful consideration of their own strength. Otherwise, they would only march to their deaths. This debacle had dealt the Imperial Guards a devastating blow.

Moreover, their covert assassination plot against the prince could not be exposed. The Imperial Guards had no choice but to swallow their humiliation. After this ordeal, they would likely retreat into the shadows.

When Wang Xiaorong saw Guan Yu, her spirits lifted. Dawn had broken, and danger seemed to have passed. Yet Prince Zou remained grim. Had everyone else perished, leaving only Guan Yu? How could they proceed now?

Behind Guan Yu, others emerged: Zou Wuhui, followed by the captain supporting the third squad leader, and a dozen more bloodied survivors. On the other side, Scarlet appeared with several dozen men, though his left leg bore a severe wound, and gashes marred his body.

After the battle, half of Guan Yu’s forces lay dead. They had faced the Imperial Guards’ elite—skilled warriors all—and paid a heavy price.

Scarlet’s group fared better. Most Imperial Guard experts had targeted Guan Yu, leaving Scarlet’s smaller, less skilled force to fight weaker opponents. Still, seven of his men fell despite their advantage.

Scarlet had shielded his comrades, charging ahead to deflect blades. His valor showcased his prowess; though wounded, his injuries were superficial and would heal with rest.

Some Imperial Guards escaped, but the rest—including a centurion—were slain by Guan Yu’s blade.

Exhausted and unrefreshed, the group bandaged wounds, ate sparingly, and regained minimal strength.

The final tally: combined with Scarlet’s losses, only sixty men remained.

Yet these survivors had proven their mettle. Prince Zou declared, “Weary as you are, this open terrain is safe. Let us rest here.”

The area offered visibility against ambushes, making it ideal.

Guan Yu addressed Scarlet: “You’ve proven your worth. If willing, take men to scavenge the ridge—those corpses may hold riches.”

Scarlet agreed. The slain Imperial Guards, including officers, likely carried valuables. Why not claim them?

“Whoever goes may keep what they find,” Scarlet announced. Many volunteered, despite lingering risks of fleeing enemies.

Guan Yu allowed it, using the opportunity to monitor for returning foes.

Prince Zou ordered the camp set up. Though remote, they had supplies and tents.

Advancing now was impossible. The wounded needed rest, especially those unable to ride. Vigilance remained crucial—though the Imperial Guards were routed, elite squads might still strike.

The scavengers returned grinning, laden with spoils. The Imperial Guards’ officers had carried ample riches, making the ordeal worthwhile despite injuries.

After a day’s rest, supplies dwindled. Guan Yu urged departure: “Prince, we must press on to Bajia City. Our food lasts only another day.”

Prince Zou agreed. As they prepared, far away, Minister Qi knelt before the Second Prince, who raged: “Your incompetence astounds me! Over a hundred guards lost, a centurion slain—this is unforgivable!”

Minister Qi pleaded, “We underestimated the prince’s protectors. A master swordsman among them—”

“Nonsense!” the prince roared. “You were to assassinate, not engage openly! Such losses are inexcusable!”

“Bandits swarmed us—twice our number. Their casualties were worse.”

“Bandits’ lives mean nothing! These elites cost fortunes! If the Emperor learns this, your head will roll!”

The Second Prince seethed. Minister Qi proposed replacements to conceal the disaster.

“Execute the survivors,” the prince ordered. “And ensure silence. The prince nears Bajia City—he must die there.”

After Minister Qi left, the prince visited Consort Guifen. Her eunuch, Yu Kong, had reported the Imperial Guards’ humiliation.

“Such incompetence!” she sneered. “Losing to bandits? Minister Qi’s disgrace will delight the Emperor.”

Yu Kong whispered, “A centurion died. The Emperor’s wrath will doom them.”

Consort Guifen smiled. “Expose this discreetly. Sever the Second Prince’s ally.”

As Yu Kong warned of Prince Zou’s approach, Consort Guifen snapped, “Your elites best not fail. No more blunders!”

The Second Prince arrived, flattering her with a colossal night pearl. “A trifle for your beauty,” he lied.

Consort Guifen feigned delight. “How generous! What brings you?”

He tested her knowledge of the debacle, downplaying losses. She played along, masking her awareness.

“Assist me,” he implored. “The prince threatens us all.”

She smiled, clutching the pearl. “Of course. But tread carefully—the Emperor’s ears are everywhere.”

As he left, she smirked. The pearl was exquisite, but his desperation amused her. Let the princes tear each other apart—her own son, the First Prince, would rise.
