“My royal son, do you wish to drive your mother to an early grave? Even if you lack wit, you still have me and Chief Steward Yu. What do you fear? Whether you desire the throne matters not, but shouldn't you at least consider our livelihood in our twilight years?” Consort Guifen declared angrily.

The conversation between mother and son within Guifen Palace was overheard by a palace maid outside. News swiftly reached the Empress, who sneered upon receiving the report. Her disdain for the Crown Prince deepened, convinced this dullard posed no threat to her own son's succession.

As dusk fell, Prince Zou's party finally arrived at Lianzhou City's gates. “Captain,” the prince instructed, “proceed first to the City Magistrate's residence. We shall seek lodging directly with Magistrate Mao.”

With a curt bow, the captain galloped ahead. Guan Yu privately thought any decent inn would suffice—after all, the prince's coffers overflowed with silver. Yet Prince Zou's timidity surprised him; perhaps the ruler feared assassins' blades more than empty coffers. The magistrate's fortified compound undoubtedly offered safer haven.

Xiao Zhi chuckled behind Wang Jun. “Never stayed in a magistrate's mansion, eh? This’ll be a treat! Magistrate Mao must roll out the crimson carpet for His Highness.”

Wang Jun, having accompanied Guan Yu on prior official visits, shrugged. “Unless he's some corrupt official, what grandeur can you expect?” In his mind, no government residence could rival the splendor of Li Manor they'd once infiltrated.

Overhearing this, Prince Zou explained, “Magistrate Mao is an old friend. Lianzhou's perennial spring scenery brought me here frequently in younger years. Though living modestly, Mao finds contentment in honest service. You young gentlemen are welcome to join us tonight.”

Wang Jun bowed hastily. “We thank Your Highness, but with the magistrate's guards ensuring your safety, we three would explore the city's night markets if permitted.”

The prince nodded, though privately wishing for their protection. To his steward he commanded: “Wu Hui, provide them silver for lodging and pleasures. Let them sample Lianzhou's delights.”

As they settled into their lavishly appointed inn rooms, Xiao Zhi marveled at the feast laid before them. “By the heavens! Serving a prince sure beats monastery gruel!”

Guan Yu warned between bites, “Disguise yourselves before venturing out. Our Yunqing Sect identities must remain hidden.”

“Why the theatrics?” Xiao Zhi protested. “We're disciples, not outlaws!”

Wang Jun grasped the danger—royal conspiracies, rival sects, demonic cults all might stalk them. When Xiao Zhi emerged later with a false beard and peasant rags, he gaped at Wang Jun's transformation. “Gods above! You're... a woman?”

Guan Yu nearly choked on his wine, memories surfacing of Wang Jun's past life—a girl forced by circumstance to masquerade as a man. Now the reverse charade proved uncannily convincing.

“Do I please you?” Wang Jun twirled in silk robes, cosmetics accentuating delicate features. Though forced by society to adopt male guise, feminine grace flowed naturally.

“A princess and peasant make poor companions,” Guan Yu noted dryly. “Choose roles that match.”

After comical adjustments, the pair ventured into bustling streets where a crowd gathered around performers. A youth raised a massive hammer above his master, who lay beneath a stone slab. “Witness true strength!” the young man proclaimed. “This strike will shatter rock yet spare flesh!”

As coins clinked into their collection plate, a heckler shoved forward. “Let me swing that hammer! Prove it's not trickery!”

The performer's retort rang sharp: “Lie beneath the stone yourself if you doubt. My strike won't kill—yours might.”

When the agitator lunged for their earnings, Xiao Zhi's voice cut through: “This thief gave no coin! I watched from start.”

The crowd murmured agreement. Enraged, the thug turned on Xiao Zhi. “What's it to you, meddler?”

Thus began the confrontation that would unravel into Chapter 3976: Smash It Down, where forged steel met true virtue beneath Lianzhou's watchful stars.
