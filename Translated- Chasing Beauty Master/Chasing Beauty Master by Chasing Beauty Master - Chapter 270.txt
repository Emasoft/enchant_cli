Guan Yu’s expression also carried a hint of confusion. Could he have encountered an old acquaintance in this unfamiliar place? But he quickly dismissed the thought, certain this was his first meeting with the man. Nevertheless, he nodded slightly and replied, “I wouldn’t call myself a ‘stormy figure,’ but if you’re referring to that Guan Yu, then yes—barring any surprises, that’s me. Though, do I know you?”

Though the words were blunt, Zhao Hu showed no irritation. Unexpectedly, his demeanor softened, the earlier tension dissolving as he shook his head with a smile. “You don’t know me, but I know you. The upheaval in N City, the resolution of its crisis, and the consolidation of its resources into an impenetrable fortress—all your doing. These days, no one in the underworld is unfamiliar with your name. From what I’ve gathered, you even extricated Mo Kai of L City from a dire predicament. And Xiao Xiong himself openly acknowledges you as his superior. Tsk tsk. I’ve had few dealings with Xiao Xiong, but I can’t help but admire the man. For a shrewd figure like him to willingly serve as your subordinate… well, that’s no ordinary feat. You might not realize it, but your reputation has spread far beyond N City. In neighboring regions, your name resounds through every shadow. So my knowing you is hardly strange.”

Guan Yu rubbed his nose, momentarily speechless. He’d never imagined his fame had grown to such heights.

Responding to Zhao Hu’s praise with modesty, Guan Yu said, “Hall Master Zhao flatters me. These were minor matters—I merely offered modest assistance.”

“Brother Guan is too humble,” Zhao Hu chuckled.

Abruptly, Zhao Hu’s expression hardened—not toward Guan Yu, but at Chen Bao. “Chen Bao!” he barked disapprovingly. “I trust Brother Guan’s character. I expect you to properly account for today’s incident.”

Chen Bao trembled. Had he failed to grasp the situation by now, his years in the underworld would’ve been wasted. He’d heard of Guan Yu’s fearsome influence—enough to make Zhao Hu’s White Tiger Hall tread carefully. The combined might of N and L Cities far outstripped the White Tiger Hall’s capabilities, forcing Zhao Hu to extend an olive branch. Thus, Chen Bao became the sacrificial pawn.

Thud! He dropped to his knees, using his uninjured hand to slap his own face with resounding force—a strike no less fierce than Guan Yu’s earlier blow to Liu Jie. “Boss Yu,” he groveled, “I beg forgiveness for my vile thoughts toward your woman. The fault is entirely mine. Please show mercy to this ignorant fool.”

Guan Yu remained impassive, watching coldly as Chen Bao’s face swelled and bled.

Chen Bao’s heart sank. Realizing reconciliation was impossible, his expression shifted through shades of desperation before he gritted his teeth and drew a pistol from his coat—retrieved earlier when fetching reinforcements. Pressing the barrel against his hand broken by Guan Yu’s kick, he stammered, “B-Boss Yu… I’ll cripple this hand to atone.”

Zhao Hu’s cheek twitched, but he offered no objection.

**Chapter 684: It Takes a Villain to Tame a Villain**

Perspective shapes action.

Zhao Hu’s silence stemmed from strategic calculation. Guan Yu’s rising influence, even without roots in M City, far exceeded the White Tiger Hall’s capacity to resist. Internally sighing, Zhao Hu hoped Chen Bao’s self-mutilation might placate Guan Yu and spare the Hall from his wrath—lest the local serpent prove powerless against this invading dragon.

Guan Yu’s composure flickered briefly, surprised by Chen Bao’s ruthless resolve.

Chen Bao’s gun hand trembled slightly before he clenched his jaw and pulled the trigger.

Like lightning, Guan Yu’s foot lashed out, kicking the weapon aside.

Bang!

The shot rang out, but instead of piercing Chen Bao’s palm, the bullet embedded itself in the wall. Though spared disfigurement, a gash now wept crimson down his hand.

“Boss Yu?” Chen Bao blinked in confusion.

“Your apology is accepted,” Guan Yu stated coolly. Prudence dictated leaving room for retreat—excessive pressure would hinder future plans.

Chen Bao exhaled in relief, gratitude flooding his eyes. “Thank you.”

Guan Yu nodded faintly.

Zhao Hu discreetly relaxed. “Brother Guan,” he smiled, “conflict breeds camaraderie. With this misunderstanding cleared, let me host you both for celebratory drinks. What say you?”

After a contemplative pause, Guan Yu replied, “Brother Hu, I appreciate the offer, but pressing matters require attention—and perhaps your assistance.”

The address “Brother Hu” widened Zhao Hu’s smile, his regard for Guan Yu warming. Respect begets respect—the title bridging their distance.

“Brother Guan,” Zhao Hu declared heartily, “in M City, you’re on my turf. Whatever you need, just ask. I, Zhao Hu, won’t hesitate if it’s within my power.”

With a smile, Guan Yu gestured for seats. “Nothing major—just aiming to improve relations with my in-laws.”

Perplexed, Zhao Hu frowned. Why would familial matters require underworld intervention? Did his woman’s family wield significant influence? Cautiously, he inquired, “How might I assist?”

“No urgency—we’ll discuss details later. First, let me conclude current business, then treat everyone to supper.” Guan Yu’s tone eased.

“Of course,” Zhao Hu agreed amiably, hierarchy forgotten before superior power.

Guan Yu turned to Liu Jie cowering in the corner, a cryptic smile playing on his lips. “Liu Jie—is this the underworld glory you craved?”

Startled from prolonged neglect, Liu Jie shuddered. Witnessing Zhao Hu—his boss’s boss—defer to Guan Yu had shattered his defiance. This man operated on stratospheric levels, making Liu Jie’s earlier provocations suicidal.

Terror-stricken, he failed to respond.

Ever perceptive, Chen Bao seized Liu Jie’s collar and hauled him forward. “Deaf, punk? Answer Boss Yu!” He flung Liu Jie before Guan Yu.

Pain cleared Liu Jie’s haze. Trembling, he stammered, “B-brother… what… what did you say?”

“Brother?!” Chen Bao paled, turning to Guan Yu in panic. “Boss Yu! I—I didn’t know he was your younger brother!”

Disaster compounded disaster—Chen Bao cursed his luck. First coveting Guan Yu’s woman, now assaulting his brother? What cosmic jest was this?

Contrary to expectations, Guan Yu approved: “Your earlier discipline lacked severity. It should’ve been harsher.”

“Eh?” Chen Bao gaped.

“I have a request,” Guan Yu continued.

Flustered, Chen Bao bowed. “Command me, Boss Yu!”

“Starting today, this boy is yours to mentor.”

Bewildered, Chen Bao ventured, “Boss Yu’s meaning…?”

He recalled Guan Yu’s fury upon learning he’d introduced Liu Jie to gang life. Now entrusting the boy to him? Was this lingering resentment?

“Precisely as stated,” Guan Yu clarified. “Scold when needed, beat when necessary—no mercy, short of permanent injury. Your goal: mold him into a model student and filial son. Manageable?”

Chen Bao’s mind reeled. A gangster teaching virtue? Yet Guan Yu illuminated the path: “It takes a villain to tame a villain.”

**Chapter 685: Borrowing a Casino**

Comprehension dawned. Though foreign to virtue, coercion was his lingua franca. Reluctance? Fists would persuade. Multiple fists if needed—hospital visits permitting.

Guan Yu dispelled doubts: “Don’t hold back. Modern medicine heals quickly. Two months—I want results.”

Catching Zhao Hu’s nod, Chen Bao thumped his chest. “You’ll have your model citizen, Boss Yu!”

Liu Jie, though young, grasped his fate. Clutching Guan Yu’s leg, he wailed, “Brother, spare me! I’ll reform!”

“You who betrayed your own sister?” Guan Yu snorted. “Expect trust?”

Liu Jie’s face drained of color. Resistance? Futile against this titan. Past struggles had only amplified punishment.

“True reformation—studious, filial, genuine—reduces suffering,” Guan Yu warned. “Any pretense, and Chen Bao’s lessons intensify. Prove yourself, and I’ll grant you a future. Doubt my word? Time will enlighten you.”

Liu Jie nodded numbly.

Satisfied, Guan Yu turned to Chen Bao. “I leave him in your care.”

“Honored, Boss Yu,” Chen Bao bowed. “Reforming souls brings fulfillment.”

At Guan Yu’s gesture, Chen Bao led Liu Jie away. Zhao Hu dismissed his entourage, leaving the trio alone.

“Brother Hu,” Guan Yu acknowledged, “I’ll remember your aid with Liu Jie.”

“Trivial,” Zhao Hu waved, pleased—a favor from Guan Yu outweighed any cost.

After introducing Lin Dong—whose nut-shell combat skills intrigued Zhao Hu—Guan Yu broached: “Brother Hu, does M City have underground casinos?”

“Cash engines,” Zhao Hu nodded. “I operate modest ones—lucrative despite irregularities. Why ask?”

“Perfect!” Guan Yu grinned. “Lend me a casino to trap someone.”

“Trap?” Zhao Hu blinked. Casino scams were routine—why would Guan Yu stoop to such tactics?

“I can’t be involved,” Guan Yu explained. “Your men must lure the target, bankrupt him at tables, stoke his gambling frenzy. Offer maximum loans—then collect debts normally. I’ll intervene then.”

Zhao Hu hesitated. Playing villain to shield Guan Yu? Unwise if the target held connections.

Reading his concern, Guan Yu added, “The mark’s a commoner—no influence.”

“Who?” Zhao Hu probed.

**Chapter 686: Trapping the Father-in-Law**

“My father-in-law—Liu Bingrong,” Guan Yu declared.

Zhao Hu stared. Father-in-law traps? Novel indeed.

The reply revealed much: the target’s identity and name. But why such elaborate schemes against an ordinary man?

Guan Yu’s smile held steel. “Let’s discuss details…”
