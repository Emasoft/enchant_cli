After exiting the casino, they went directly to Guan Yu's car. Xue Jing entered first and took the back seat. When Jin Ciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) got in, he started complaining again, "I must say, Guan Yu, while this car looks flashy enough from the outside, the interior is rather cramped. Sitting here feels suffocating. You're not short of money—couldn't you get a different car?"

Truth be told, this remark reminded Guan Yu that he didn't need to drive his own car every time he went out. With so many women at Qiao Garden District—each owning their own vehicle—he could simply borrow one. Not only would this allow him to experience different driving sensations, but it would also help avoid unwanted attention.

Though SUVs offered more spacious interiors and better visibility, Guan Yu still preferred the comfort of sedans. This particular car had accompanied him for years, and he couldn't bear to abandon it. Modified with reinforced steel plates, it had become a veritable "road tank," its safety rating far surpassing ordinary vehicles. Guan Yu felt most at ease driving it.

"Allowing you into my car at all is an act of mercy. What more do you have to complain about?" Guan Yu retorted with a reproachful glance. "If you're dissatisfied, feel free to stand outside. We can discuss matters just the same."

He wasn't wrong. Aside from himself, only women from Qiao Garden District had ever ridden in this car. The ladies there were fastidious about cleanliness—if anyone else sat in it, they'd deem the vehicle "contaminated" and refuse to use it. Once, when Hou Jinshun had driven it to evade pursuers, Lü Mei and A Mei nearly dismantled the entire interior during cleaning, requiring Wang Shu's help to reassemble it—with many parts needing replacement.

The only reason Xue Jing had allowed Jin Ciyu Lang inside today was his status as Guan Yu's brother-in-law. Still, she knew the car would need thorough cleaning afterward. For now, the vehicle's privacy offered safety amidst the casino's bustling crowd—better than risking eavesdroppers outside.

**Chapter 2848: A Favor to Ask**

Sensing Guan Yu's irritation, Jin Ciyu Lang decided not to provoke him further. "The interior's stylish enough," he muttered, "comfortable and spacious... just the roof feels a bit low."

Guan Yu felt some satisfaction watching the other man's discomfort. Jin Ciyu Lang's profligate spending of the million yuan he'd received—funds that could have greatly benefited the Yu Gang—rankled him deeply. From now on, Guan Yu resolved, the man wouldn't see another cent.

Xue Jing suppressed a smile as the two resumed their habitual squabbling. Their rivalry had intensified ever since Guan Yu brought Yingzi to Qiao Garden District. Previously, Jin Ciyu Lang had maintained some respect for Guan Yu's combat skills, but since losing his cultivation abilities, Guan Yu could only assert dominance through Yingzi—a fact that chafed at the warrior's pride.

"Brother Jin," Xue Jing interjected softly, "we came to ask for your help."

"Oh? A favor?" Jin Ciyu Lang straightened immediately, shooting Guan Yu a sidelong glance. "So you need me, yet still put on airs?"

Guan Yu turned away dismissively. "This has nothing to do with me. She's the one asking."

"You—!" Jin Ciyu Lang sputtered. "Hiding behind women? Have you no shame?"

Xue Jing continued smoothly, "We need information about recent visitors to the Golden Prosperity Pawnshop—particularly those interested in the treasure map. There might be hidden enemies among them."

Jin Ciyu Lang scoffed. "Why me? Don't you have lackeys for this?"

"Students would draw suspicion, and Jones' people aren't suited for covert work," Xue Jing explained. "You're perfect—capable of handling any martial encounters."

Realizing he'd been outmaneuvered, Jin Ciyu Lang surrendered. "Fine. What specifics?"

As Xue Jing outlined surveillance details on Old Wu's contacts and Qi Zhi's background checks, Guan Yu added pointedly, "Remember—no payment involved. Consider it... family duty."

**Chapter 2849: Knowing Limits**

Jin Ciyu Lang glared but held his tongue. Better to finish this quickly and return to gambling companions than waste time on petty victories.

"Any interest in antiques?" Guan Yu prodded.

"None!" came the curt reply.

Xue Jing intervened, "Brother Jin, while we won't interfere with your... hobbies, please stay alert. Earlier, you didn't even notice us approaching."

The warrior straightened proudly. "I sensed you ten steps away. A killer loses edge only once—and dies."

**Chapter 2850: Measured Responses**

As plans solidified for monitoring the pawnshop and testing Qi Zhi's capabilities, Jin Ciyu Lang finally stood. "Enough talk. I'll have answers within three days."

Guan Yu's parting jab followed him out: "Try not to gamble away your senses before then."

The car door slammed shut on laughter and unresolved tensions—another round in their endless duel of wits and pride.
