“That young man is dangerous!” Outside the bar, Lin Dong hesitated before speaking. As a professional killer, his instincts were razor-sharp. He could sense an aura of peril emanating from the youth. In terms of combat skills, that fellow might even surpass him.

Guan Yu looked at Lin Dong as if observing a monkey, marveling, “Tsk tsk, is this really our great assassin Lin Dong? To think you’d say such a thing!”

“I’m not joking!” Lin Dong said gravely.

Guan Yu curled his lip. Of course he knew Lin Dong wasn’t joking. If someone could make Li Yu submit, how could they not be dangerous? He wasn’t an idiot. Still, Guan Yu remained unperturbed, always believing in meeting challenges head-on. As long as this guy didn’t cause trouble for him, he couldn’t be bothered.

After a pause, Guan Yu suddenly gazed at Lin Dong with an ingratiating smile that raised goosebumps on the assassin’s arms. “Why are you looking at me like that?” Lin Dong asked warily.

“Let’s make a deal! Help me by carrying me to Li Xi’s house!”

……

Guan Yu had originally planned to feign drunkenness to test Li Xi’s feelings, but Lin Dong stubbornly refused to carry him back. Reluctantly, he settled for being supported back, then having Lin Dong inform Li Xi he’d overindulged.

Arriving at the Li family villa, Lin Dong unceremoniously dumped Guan Yu onto the sofa. The impact left Guan Yu dizzy, inwardly cursing: Damn it! Even if the sofa’s soft, couldn’t you be gentler? Don’t you know your own strength?

Chapter 994...

While Guan Yu silently complained, Lin Dong told Li Xi “Guan Yu got drunk – I brought him back” before leaving. For someone of his temperament, maintaining this act was already commendable. Any longer and he might have blown his cover.

After Lin Dong departed, Li Xi remained seated, coolly remarking, “If you stain my sofa, don’t expect to enter this door again.”

Shit! How does she know I’m faking? Guan Yu nearly jumped up, but realized – if Li Xi truly knew he was pretending, she’d have ignored him and gone upstairs. This was clearly a test.

Understanding the situation, Guan Yu lay motionless on the sofa, emitting thunderous snores.

Sure enough, after prolonged stillness, Li Xi hesitated before setting down her book and approaching. Gazing at the “sleeping” Guan Yu, a thought suddenly struck her: Viewed like this, he’s actually quite handsome.

Guan Yu’s square jaw and chiseled features gave him a rugged handsomeness different from pretty-boy actors. His usual lecherous demeanor had always made Li Xi distrust him, but now...

In this quiet moment, she realized he wasn’t bad-looking – certainly more appealing than Song Qifeng.

Remembering Song Qifeng, Li Xi recalled Guan Yu’s jealous expression that afternoon and chuckled softly. This guy could be adorable when jealous, yet so manly when fighting.

What kind of person was he really?

Feeling Li Xi’s prolonged gaze, Guan Yu finally opened his eyes. “Am I that handsome?”

Li Xi jumped in surprise, instinctively trying to retreat. But Guan Yu seized her wrist, pulling her onto himself.

This being her first time embraced like this, Li Xi flushed crimson as she felt Guan Yu’s body heat. “Let me go!” she panicked.

“Kiss me or call me ‘husband,’ then I’ll release you!”

……

Guan Yu wasn’t foolish enough to comply. Since Li Xi hesitated, he’d take initiative. He refused to believe she felt nothing for him.

“Guan Yu, I’ll get angry!”

Though Li Xi tried sounding stern, her rosy cheeks undermined any threat. Guan Yu grinned fearlessly. “What’ll you do when angry? Bite me?”

No sooner had he spoken than Li Xi sank her teeth into his shoulder.

If he hadn’t mentioned it, she might not have thought of this! Considering his thick skin even survived car crashes, a few bites should be fine.

She showed no mercy. The pain sent cold sweat pouring down Guan Yu’s back. As he tried pushing her away, his hand accidentally grasped something soft, followed by twin piercing shrieks.

One came from Li Xi, the other from Lin Lin who’d just entered.

Seeing them, Lin Lin quickly turned away. “I saw nothing! Continue!”

Continue what? Guan Yu wondered. Just a bite – what’s to continue?

Before he could speak, he noticed Li Xi’s face burning scarlet, murder in her eyes. “Remove your hand!”

“What’s wrong with my...” Guan Yu paused, feeling the softness. Looking down, he understood her fury – his hand had landed on her full breasts.

His strength distorted the perky mounds into sensual shapes.

Guan Yu stared dumbly at the oval forms in his grasp, drool nearly dripping. His growing erection pressed against Li Xi’s thigh.

“Guan Yu, you...” Knowing what that was, Li Xi’s face burned hotter. She bit his shoulder again.

Watching covertly, Lin Lin shook her head. “Lovers are terrifying.”

……

Guan Yu felt his shoulder going numb. Had this girl no restraint? Her bites seemed intent on removing flesh. Did she have some twisted fetish?

Unable to bear Guan Yu’s strange look, Li Xi straightened her clothes and left with Lin Lin.

When Guan Yu tried following, his phone rang – Wen Qing. Her sweet voice said Wen Baoguo wanted him at the Wen residence.

Abandoning overnight plans, Guan Yu drove to the Wens.

“Father-in-law, what’s up? Not another virility treatment? I’m busy.” If this was about acupuncture for potency, he’d leave immediately.

Wen Baoguo reddened, growling, “Brat! I’m hale and hearty – no need for your needles!”

You? Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Noticing others present, he asked properly: “What’s the matter?”

“You’re attending Zongze’s ball tomorrow?”

“Yeah. Why?”

Guan Yu wondered why his father-in-law brought this up.

A uniformed man beside Wen Baoguo spoke: “We received intel – someone plans to target you there.”

“Target me? Who?”

“Unknown.”

“Bullshit! You tell me this without details? What kind of intelligence operation is this? Can’t even protect national security like this!”

Seeming to read his mind, Wen Baoguo awkwardly explained: “The captured operative received professional training – we’ve extracted nothing yet. But we’ve guessed their origins and motives.”

“Well?” Guan Yu frowned. He hadn’t made so many enemies – why constant targeting?

Chapter 995 You Want Me...

“Border terrorists. They operate illegally in surrounding cities. That’s all I can say.” The soldier said coolly.

Terrorists? Guan Yu blinked. He’d never crossed these desperados. Why target him?

“Because of Feng Xin – but you’re the root cause.”

Wen Baoguo inwardly sighed. This rascal had no talents except chasing women. Feng Xin, though a mafia princess, came from a decades-rooted family. Her grandfather, a formidable figure, actually let his granddaughter be a concubine!

Then again, his own daughter was this brat’s concubine too. Sigh...

Hearing Feng Xin involved, Guan Yu panicked: “What’s Feng Xin got to do with this?” He worried not for himself, but his women’s safety.

“The Fengs’ decades-long dominance in N City isn’t unearned. The terrorists want cooperation – offering manpower and weapons in exchange for cover.”

Wen Baoguo chuckled: “Your little girlfriend’s vicious. She refused and arrested their negotiators. These international criminals won’t take such humiliation lightly.”

Actually, terrorists blended into crowds seamlessly. Monitoring proved difficult except in N City – the Fengs’ turf. Their intelligence network surpassed official channels, having thwarted many terrorist plots.

Hence, deep hatred. But the Fengs’ entrenched position made retaliation hard. Unlike authorities, attacking N City wouldn’t hurt the Fengs – hence the cooperation offer. Their refusal and humiliation demanded vengeance.

Coinciding with Guan Yu dismantling the underworld’s Menghao faction, terrorists shifted focus to him.

“But killing me helps them how? It’d only hinder their operations!” Guan Yu grimaced – being terrorists’ target felt absurd.

“Forget tomorrow’s host?”

Guan Yu blinked. “Hu Zongze?”

“Zongze’s event can’t be called merely a ball now.”

Not merely a ball? Then what?

Guan Yu looked puzzled.

“Know tomorrow’s attendees?” Wen Baoguo asked.

Guan Yu shook his head. He’d come to assert dominance over Wen Qing, indifferent to others.

“Every guest represents Beijing’s major families and factions – the capital’s future leaders.”

All? Guan Yu’s heart raced. Beijing’s factions held national influence. This gathering’s significance...

Hu Zongze’s ambitions were clear. Guan Yu sneered inwardly.

“Understand now? Any incident tomorrow – whether you or others – would devastate Zongze and the Hu family. You’re just their chosen target.”

Wen Baoguo joked grimly. Despite disliking Guan Yu’s philandering, he acknowledged the youth’s brilliance – why the family patriarch groomed him as Wen heir.

Lucky? Guan Yu scoffed. Ordinary people would’ve wet themselves from such “luck.”

“Regardless, protect Xiao Qing tomorrow! Any harm to her, and you’re banned from the Wens forever!” Wen Baoguo warned solemnly.

For once not contradicting, Guan Yu nodded. “No one will hurt Xiao Qing. No one.”

……

Returning to his room, Guan Yu found Wen Qing lounging with a laptop. She sniffed, “You remembered to come back!”

The girl sulked about him visiting Li Xi.

“Darling, what’re you playing?”

“Hmph! None of your business!”

As Guan Yu lay beside her, she turned away. Chuckling, he pulled her into his arms, chin resting on her fragrant hair.

“Sweetheart, I missed you.”

Wen Qing blinked coquettishly. “Missed what?”

Her playful sensuality ignited Guan Yu’s desire. His hand crept under her nightgown, grasping softness. “Missed these!”

Wen Qing gasped, slapping his hand. “They didn’t miss you!”

“As long as you did!” Guan Yu moved to undress her, but she resisted.

“What’s wrong?”

“My... my period just ended.” Her face glowed crimson.

Guan Yu paused. “Isn’t that perfect timing?”

“Silly!” She pouted. “It’s my fertile window now – we might make a baby!”

So that was her worry. Guan Yu laughed. “So what? You’re my wife – isn’t that normal? Don’t want my child?”

“Not that! But they say pregnancy ruins your figure!”

Guan Yu nearly collapsed. Her concern wasn’t conception, but figure preservation! Infuriating!

He spanked her rounded bottom. “Refusing babies for vanity? Deserves punishment!”

“Husband, I’m sorry!” Wen Qing’s voice turned breathy from the tingle.

“What’s the penalty?”

“How about... kneeling for you?”

Guan Yu finally pounced like a wolf.

Despite nighttime exertions, Guan Yu awoke early next morning. Watching Wen Qing sleep in his arms, contentment flooded him.

I’ll protect you all. No one will harm you!

Past Guan Yu desired only passionate love and peaceful family life. Present Guan Yu sought only to shield his loved ones.

Al-Qaeda? Think your terrorist label scares me? Harm my women, and I’ll erase you from existence!

Guan Yu’s eyes gleamed with draconic ferocity – a awakened beast radiating terrifying majesty.
