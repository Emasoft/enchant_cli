Old Wu began explaining the reason for adding honey to the tea. "Not all teas are suitable for honey. This Yellow Leaf Tea of mine is a specialty from southern tropical regions. It can only grow in tropical climates where the weather is stifling and humid, making it difficult to sun-dry the leaves thoroughly."

"After packaging and the time it takes to reach us, the tea develops a slight musty odor. Adding honey during the first brew not only eliminates unwanted flavors but also enhances the tea's integration with water. Though the first infusion carries a hint of honeyed sweetness, the second brew loses it entirely."

"This Yellow Leaf Tea inherently carries a strong bitter-sweetness that many find challenging. However, honey softens its astringency. While the tea itself invigorates the mind and sharpens focus, combining it with honey amplifies these effects while also nourishing health and complexion."

"Hahaha! So that's why!" Bill Lin remarked with an air of connoisseurship. "The tea's subtle sweet-sour notes create a uniquely pleasant flavor. The lingering bitterness is beautifully tempered by the honey's tang—truly remarkable."

Zhang De, who had initially suspected Bill Lin of pretentious posturing, now realized the young man genuinely understood tea craftsmanship.

"Excellent tea," Zhang De interjected, "but shouldn't we discuss business first? We can savor tea another day." He wondered if these two might become regular tea companions.

Old Wu had been waiting for this cue. Smiling, he said, "Very well. You've both examined the treasure map. However, Young Master Bill's offer of nine million seems rather modest given your renowned generosity. Might we reconsider the price?"

Bill Lin poured himself another thimble-sized cup. While tea could be freely consumed, financial negotiations required sterner stuff. "Mr. Wu, my offer stands fair. Your greed for greater profit blinds you to the advantages of this transaction—not merely selling an object, but securing safety and friendship. Must you hold out for tens of millions? No other buyer would pay even this price." His patient tone belied his determination to cap the offer.

Chapter 2,866: Irritation

As Bill Lin concluded, Old Wu glanced meaningfully at Zhang De. The elderly merchant knew Zhang De collaborated with the mysterious phone caller and expected intervention.

Right on cue, Zhang De declared, "Old Wu, since Young Bill offers nine million, I'll raise it to ten million on the Yang Family's behalf."

Bill Lin stared in disbelief. Was this fool undermining previous negotiations? All that careful bargaining wasted! Idiot, he mentally cursed, his goodwill toward Zhang De evaporating instantly.

Old Wu refilled all teacups without comment, allowing the bidding war to escalate naturally.

"Zhang De," Bill Lin challenged, "didn't you say the Yang Patriarch isn't truly interested? Or did I mishear?"

"I follow the family head's orders without question," Zhang De replied blandly. "Perhaps your understanding falters."

Old Wu concealed a smile. The staged competition unfolded perfectly. Without agreeing to the 10% commission scheme, he'd have settled for mere millions. Now...

Bill Lin's irritation stemmed from Yang Family's reckless bidding. Each raise benefited only Old Wu. "Mr. Wu," he pressed, "you know I'm a serious collector. My initial offer reflects genuine interest."

"Indeed!" Old Wu nodded obsequiously. "Young Master Bill's renowned collection and discerning taste are legendary."

Flattered, Bill Lin increased his bid: "Twelve million. Let's conclude this now."

Old Wu's heart leapt—three million gained in moments! The auction-style competition was just beginning.

"Fifteen million," Zhang De countered casually, fiddling with his phone while sipping tea.

Bill Lin's temper flared. This arbitrary three-million jump threatened to spiral out of control. "Does the Yang Patriarch set no limits? Where's the profit in this madness?"

"My orders adapt to circumstances," Zhang De shrugged. "Should you withdraw, I'll happily pay fifteen million and report success."

Recognizing Yang Family's determination, Bill Lin made a decisive move: "Twenty million. Final offer."

Old Wu nearly laughed aloud—double his original expectation! Yet he maintained composure, knowing Zhang De would counter.

Following secret instructions from his hidden director Guan Yu, Zhang De upped the ante: "Twenty-five million. The Yangs never quibble over petty millions."

Bill Lin's eyes narrowed at the blatant provocation. "Thirty million!" he snapped, gulping scalding tea in agitation. The searing pain made him yelp.

"Careful, Young Master!" Old Wu fretted while secretly delighted. "Shall I pack some tea for your departure?"

Zhang De hid a smirk at Bill Lin's burnt tongue. "Perhaps seek medical attention? Those blisters look painful."

"Thirty... thirty-five million!" Bill Lin hissed through the pain, refusing to yield.

Old Wu's joy overflowed. "Four million already! Truly, Young Master's generosity—"

"Forty-five million," Zhang De cut in coolly, obeying Guan Yu's remote command. From his sofa, the puppeteer calculated: After Old Wu's 15% cut and fees, they still profited handsomely.

Bill Lin slammed his cup down. "Are you mad? Even auction resales won't recoup this! Consult your patriarch!"

"My orders stand," Zhang De replied impassively. "The treasure map's scarcity guarantees fifty-million resale value."

Old Wu played mediator: "If no higher bids, the map goes to Yang Family at forty-five—"

"Sixty million!" Bill Lin roared, holding up six fingers. "Final offer!"

Zhang De hesitated theatrically. "This exceeds expectations... Perhaps we should—"

"Sixty-five million!" Guan Yu's message forced Zhang De's counter.

Bill Lin's composure shattered. "Yang Family challenges my resources? Seventy million!"

The room stilled. Old Wu's hands trembled as he poured tea. Seventy million! His commission alone—

"Seventy-five million," Zhang De stated calmly.

Bill Lin's face purpled. "Eighty... No! One hundred million!" The nuclear option.

Silence descended. Even Guan Yu paused. At this price, profits dwindled—but prestige mattered.

"Yang Family withdraws," Zhang De announced suddenly. "Congratulations, Young Master Bill."

Old Wu's ecstatic laughter filled the room. "Magnificent! Let's finalize the documents—"

Chapter 2,867: Revelation

As paperwork commenced, Old Wu inquired casually, "When does Yang Family plan their next auction? Rumors suggest—"

"Our auctions aren't scheduled," Zhang De explained, parroting Guan Yu's instructions. "We accumulate artifacts until having sufficient inventory. Only then do we announce events."

Both Old Wu and Bill Lin absorbed this revelation. The latter finally understood Yang Family's secretive success.

"And currently..." Bill Lin probed, nursing his injured tongue, "you're accumulating pieces like this map for the next event?"

"Precisely," Zhang De confirmed. "Given Young Master's eighty-million bid, Yang Family concedes. Unless..." He let the challenge hang.

Bill Lin glared. "No more games! The map is mine."

Old Wu beamed while processing calculations. Eighty million! Fifteen percent plus... His fingers itched to check the transfer.

Later, as they departed, Zhang De received Guan Yu's final message: "Well played. Let Bill overpay. Our true treasure lies elsewhere."

The curtain fell on this act, but the game had just begun.
