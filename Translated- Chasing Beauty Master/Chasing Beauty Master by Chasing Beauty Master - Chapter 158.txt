Du Xiaojuan listened in confusion, offering comfort: "If the taste of alcohol is unpleasant, stop drinking. Whatever troubles you have, tell me—perhaps I can help."

Mo Ling responded with a bitter smile and shake of her head. Was it truly the taste of alcohol that pained her?

In a nearby booth, a raucous group of men and women drank boisterously, exchanging lewd remarks. Each man groped the woman in his lap with wandering hands. Among them stood a particularly conspicuous figure—Wang Hu, his face bruised and swollen, bandages wrapped around injuries sustained earlier that afternoon. Raising his glass with a strained grin that pulled painfully at his facial wounds, he proclaimed: "Brother Feng, after we settle this matter, I'll treat everyone to drinks. Cheers!"

Had Guan Yu been present, he would have recognized this as the same "Tiger Brother" he'd soundly beaten hours earlier. Wang Hu's hatred burned fiercely—even when cornered, Guan Yu had shown no mercy. Now, vengeance would be exacted.

The man addressed as "Brother Feng"—Lin Feng, around thirty with a muscular build—wore a perpetual smile that radiated no warmth, only cunning. Clinking glasses, he dismissed the matter: "Dealing with a mere student? Child's play."

"But the boy has formidable skills," Wang Hu cautioned.

Lin Feng's hand roamed his companion's breasts as his gaze fixed hungrily on Mo Ling. "What skills could rival bullets?" he sneered.

Wang Hu chuckled, observing his leader's interest. "Brother Feng's taste remains impeccable. Those two are rare beauties—innocent yet devastatingly alluring."

"Indeed," Lin Feng agreed, eyes gleaming. "Such quality is scarce in L City. To find two at this bar... fortuitous."

"Why not invite them over?" Wang Hu leered.

Lin Feng withdrew his wandering hand, eyeing his subordinate. "You believe you can summon them?"

"Women here either seek fun or money." Wang Hu squeezed his companion's breast, drawing a mock-protest. "All pretense of pride melts before cash. Watch—I'll have them servicing us like trained songbirds tonight."

Approaching the women, Wang Hu affected courtesy: "Lovely ladies, might I offer you drinks?"

Du Xiaojuan started at the intrusion. Taking in Wang Hu's battered face, she blurted: "Uncle, you look worse than a hog's head! Shouldn't you be resting?"

Mo Ling continued drinking silently.

Undeterred, Wang Hu's gaze dropped to Du Xiaojuan's chest. "Missing your beauty would be my true regret. Allow me—"

"We're leaving," Du Xiaojuan cut him off.

Wang Hu smirked. "100,000 yuan each. One night with me and my friend."

Mo Ling answered by upending her glass over his head. "Get lost."

As Wang Hu bristled, Lin Feng appeared, deftly dropping a pill into Mo Ling's drink. "My apologies for this oaf's behavior," he smooth-talked, draining a glass. "Let me make amends."

Du Xiaojuan ignored him. Mo Ling reached for her tainted drink.

Lin Feng's smile widened—until Du Xiaojuan seized Mo Ling's arm. "Teacher Mo, you've had enough. Let's go."

Breaking free, Mo Ling raised the glass. Lin Feng licked his lips in anticipation.

The cup shattered on the floor. All turned to see Guan Yu, his expression stormy. "What's a woman doing drowning herself in drink?"

Du Xiaojuan brightened. "Guan Yu! Help us get Teacher Mo home!"

Mo Ling's blurred gaze sharpened at his profile before dimming. "None of your concern."

"Not my business?" Guan Yu's voice hardened. "Except when scum spike your drink?"

Shock rippled through the women. Lin Feng's smirk faltered.

Wang Hu's fists clenched. "You again?! Can't escape you, brat!"

Guan Yu's icy stare shifted between them. "Afternoon beating wasn't enough?"

Lin Feng interjected coldly: "So you're the college punk causing trouble. Let's settle this."

"Think your thug can handle me?" Guan Yu taunted.

Wang Hu sneered: "You're nothing against the Gun Gang's Brother Feng!"

Guan Yu's lip curled. "A gang boss resorting to roofies? How noble."

Lin Feng's smile vanished. His leg shot out—only to slow inexplicably mid-kick. Guan Yu's fist connected with a sickening crunch, sending Lin Feng crashing through a table.

As spectators scattered, bar staff surrounded the gang members. Lin Feng rose, cradling his ruined hand, left hand creeping toward his jacket—

Guan Yu blurred forward. Steel glinted—a pistol pressed to his forehead.

"Bullets move faster than fists," Lin Feng panted.

Bar patrons fled screaming as weapons appeared on both sides. Guan Yu remained calm. "Shoot me, and none leave alive."

Lin Feng's eyes narrowed. "Safe passage. That's all I want."

"Denied." Guan Yu's grin turned feral.
