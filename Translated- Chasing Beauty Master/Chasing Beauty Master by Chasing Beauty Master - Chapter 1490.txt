Yan Zhao let out a relieved sigh, his expression visibly improving. The Demon Lord chuckled, "Hoho, Yan Zhao, fortune truly favors you. Had Three-Headed not been present today, I couldn't have cured this injury. You might have truly faced amputation."

"Perhaps Heaven still shows you mercy, arranging your encounter with Three-Headed. He's the renowned Medical Immortal who can cure any ailment. Your luck holds," the Demon Lord added with a smile.

Yan Zhao hastily bowed in gratitude. "My deepest thanks for Demon Lord's sanctuary and Medical Immortal Three-Headed's divine intervention. Yet I must inquire - when can treatment for this foot injury begin? The excruciating pain worsens nightly, leaving me sleepless in agony."

"Let the pain serve as penance," Three-Headed retorted coldly. "At least those you've wronged may find some peace."

Yan Zhao stiffened, unprepared for this reminder of his massacre of the elderly couple in the bamboo grove, nor the near-fatal attack on Three-Headed's younger brother Xiao Qi. The lingering resentment was expected.

Swallowing pride, Yan Zhao adopted complete submission. For survival's sake, he'd play the groveling dog if required. "Medical Immortal Three-Headed, regarding the bamboo grove incident... I deeply regret it. The blood toxin's eruption stripped me of consciousness, leaving only bloodlust. Surely you understand this involuntary state?"

"Shall I blame myself instead?" Three-Headed's anger flared. "That elderly couple sought only peaceful retirement! How could you slaughter them so mercilessly?"

The Demon Lord intervened swiftly. "Three-Headed, let past grievances rest. Yan Zhao now belongs to our Demonic Soul Sect. Consider my face if not his. We stand united now."

When Three-Headed remained silent, the sect leader continued, "United we strengthen our sect. I expect former enmities buried for collective prosperity."

"Your will commands my utmost obedience," Yan Zhao pledged with another bow, the picture of docility.

Three-Headed wordlessly saluted the Demon Lord before turning to leave. At the threshold, he threw over his shoulder, "Come tomorrow for treatment. Prepare to endure mortal agony - you might perish from pain. Don't come unprepared."

Joy illuminated Yan Zhao's face. "I'll be there without fail! This life debt shall never be forgotten!"

"Three-Headed, wait!" The Demon Lord's command halted the departing physician.

"What more does the Demon Lord require?" Three-Headed asked tersely.

"Having interacted with Guan Yu - what weapon caused Yan Zhao's injury? A mere ankle strike nears mortality. What unknown armament exists beyond my knowledge?"

Three-Headed shrugged. "During our contact, Guan Yu bore grave injuries from Yan Zhao's schemes. He employed no mystic arts or tools. Inquire elsewhere." He departed hastily, avoiding further delays.

Yan Zhao's spirits soared despite lingering foot pain. Today brought both the Demon Lord's acceptance into the Demonic Soul Sect and hope for his supposedly incurable injury. Reborn through heaven's grace, he envisioned surpassing his former status in Cloud Azure Sect.

"Guan Yu!" The name burned acid in Yan Zhao's mind. This tormentor who'd crippled him would face dismemberment when the time came.

Noticing Yan Zhao's expression, the Demon Lord remarked, "Such hatred in your eyes. What brews in your mind?"

"Esteemed Lord, I despise Cloud Azure Sect and all its members. They reduced me to this state. When my cultivation ascends, iron retribution shall visit them!"

"Excellent!" The Demon Lord approved. "Nurture this resolve. Rest assured - when Three-Headed promises treatment, he delivers. Focus on recovery."

As Yan Zhao expressed gratitude, the sect leader pressed, "You claim ignorance of Guan Yu's weapon. Describe the attack."

"I saw nothing. When pain erupted and bleeding persisted, I fled. Guan Yu couldn't pursue." Yan Zhao lied smoothly.

"Curious... Could unknown arms exist beyond my ken?" The Demon Lord mused. "To formally join us, you must disclose all Cloud Azure teachings - including Profound Enlightenment's legacy and Meritorious Cauldron's transmissions. In exchange, I'll impart our sect's supreme arts."

"Gladly! After recovery, I'll divulge everything. Honored to learn the Demonic Soul Sect's mystic ways!"

Dismissed, Yan Zhao departed with renewed vigor. The Demon Lord contemplated summoning Wang Xiaorong for answers about Guan Yu's mysterious weapon.

When the young woman arrived petulantly, her father inquired about Guan Yu's possessions.

Xiaorong bristled. "Why this sudden interest? Planning to harm him?"

"Can't I show interest in my future son-in-law?" The Demon Lord feigned hurt. "Twenty years I raised you alone since your mother's passing. Now you'd abandon me for some man?"

"Father!" Xiaorong protested. "Must I remain unwed to please you? Would you steal my life's happiness?"

Their argument continued until Right Envoy's arrival interrupted. Learning of Yan Zhao's situation, the advisor cautioned: "That ambitious snake bears watching, Lord."

The Demon Lord nodded. "My curiosity lies with Guan Yu's weapon. This ankle injury nearly proved fatal. What power does he wield?"

Realizing the true motive, Xiaorong relented: "Guan Yu carries a foreign artifact called 'gun' - a metal tube launching lead pellets with thunderous force. That's what injured Yan Zhao."

The Demon Lord's eyes glinted with revelation as Xiaorong described the firearm. This "gun" warranted further investigation - perhaps a game-changer in the cultivation world's balance of power.
