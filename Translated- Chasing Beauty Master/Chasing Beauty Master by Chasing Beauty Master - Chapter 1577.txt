“I had hoped to shake their morale, but after speaking, there was no effect. Their men seemed genuinely loyal, each face still wearing that resolute expression—as if they didn’t care even if we truly intended to slaughter them all.

‘Hahaha, my men have undergone rigorous training,’ the leader chuckled mockingly. ‘Did you think my forces are like the trash you hire with coin from the outside? A few petty words to destabilize my army? You overestimate yourselves.’

Such arrogance. Others might endure it, but Wang Xiaorong could not. Her hand crossbow was already primed. Though the distance to the leader was considerable—around fifty meters—the line of sight was clear.

The enemy soldiers stood on the ground, while their leader, positioned further back, sat atop a horse, granting him a better vantage.

Wang Xiaorong aimed her crossbow at him but hesitated. At this range, she wasn’t certain if the bolt could reach.

Guan Yu halted his advance. The leader’s frontlines were densely packed, making a frontal assault difficult. Worse, their rear was encircled by pools of flammable oil—a deadly trap.

‘Fine. Since we’re surrounded and you plan to burn us alive, go ahead. Light the fire now,’ Guan Yu said, stepping back. ‘But know this: Prince Zou isn’t among us. I’ll make this clear—he isn’t here. By now, he’s likely already reached Inscription City via the mountain path.’

This was a bluff. Prince Zou had remained hidden in the carriage, unseen by the enemy.

‘Impossible!’ the leader retorted. ‘Prince Zou is inside that carriage. Otherwise, why would you defend it so desperately?’

‘A ruse, a stratagem. How else could we deceive you?’ Guan Yu replied coolly. ‘I speak truthfully: the prince isn’t there. Kill us all, and it’ll be for nothing.’

‘Do you take me for a fool? “Come and see”? Ridiculous!’ The leader wavered. Approaching was out of the question, but if the prince truly wasn’t present, this entire ambush was wasted effort.

‘Then lift the carriage curtain. If Prince Zou isn’t inside, I’ll spare you. I’ve no desire for unnecessary bloodshed,’ the leader offered.

‘A jest—an international one!’ Guan Yu sneered. ‘We’d all lay down our lives for the prince. Do you think we’d let you peek inside? We’re stalling for time. Can’t you tell?’

Wang Jun interjected defiantly, ‘Enough talk! You think your pathetic oil can stop us? Dream on! We’ve a hundred ways to snuff your flames.’

‘Hah! To cling to such bravado in your dire state!’ the leader laughed. ‘Since you seek death, I’ll oblige. Whether the prince is here or not, this shall be your grave!’

*Swish—*

Without warning, Wang Xiaorong’s crossbow bolt streaked through the air. In two breaths, it was at the leader’s face.

Reacting on instinct honed through years of battle, the leader jerked his head aside. A metallic ‘needle’ whistled past, shearing off a strip of hair from his scalp.

Cold sweat drenched the leader’s brow. A heartbeat slower, and the bolt would have pierced his skull.

‘Damn it,’ Guan Yu muttered. ‘Xiaozi, Eryatou—if they light the fire, douse it with spells.’

He’d seen Wang Xiaorong’s shot. The leader’s survival was sheer luck. Guan Yu would’ve aimed for the torso—a larger target, harder to evade.

Now enraged, the leader would surely order the fire lit. His evasion proved his combat prowess.

‘Bastard! Sneak attacking me!’ the leader roared, touching his shorn scalp. His black merchant’s cap lay discarded, revealing the ludicrous bald stripe. Guan Yu’s men erupted in laughter, further fueling the leader’s fury—and fear.

What hidden weapon had nearly claimed him? No movement detected, yet death had grazed him.

**Chapter 4090: Drizzling Rain**

Deciding horseback made him too conspicuous, the leader dismounted. The attack had likely come from near the carriage. Regardless of the prince’s presence, it was time to burn them all.

Guan Yu bellowed, ‘Final warning: leave now, or none of you will!’

As Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun prepared spells, Guan Yu knew the oil would ignite swiftly. Many of their own were already doused in it—a single spark would engulf them.

The leader hesitated. These cornered foes showed no fear. Did they have reinforcements?

Then he spotted it—two figures on horseback holding glowing artifacts. *Mages.*

Though he lacked magical aptitude, he recognized spellcraft. Prince Zou’s retinue included sorcerers. This changed everything.

Yet retreating now would humiliate his elite unit. ‘Fall back! Light the fire!’ he commanded.

Soldiers scattered as two torchbearers rode forward.

‘Retreat to the rear! Those coated in oil, stay back!’ Guan Yu ordered. ‘They’ve sealed our fate—show no mercy!’

He directed Zou Wuhui to escort the prince from the carriage along the cliffside, away from the impending blaze.

Torches met oil. Flames roared—but Wang Jun summoned a gale, bending the fire outward. Xiao Zhi conjured drizzling rain, which Wang Xiaorong amplified into a downpour, dousing the flames.

The spells, improvised from Guan Yu’s teachings, drew her scorn. ‘Pathetic灵力 (spiritual power),’ she scoffed.

As the fire died, the group escaped through the extinguished zone. The enemy, having retreated too far, couldn’t regroup in time.

Prince Zou reentered his carriage, exiting unscathed as they marched past the stunned foes.

‘Attack! Slaughter them all!’ the leader screamed.

Chaos erupted. Guan Yu guarded the carriage single-handedly, felling any who neared. Zou Wuxiao and the Second Captain fought ruthlessly, blades dripping crimson.

‘Wuxiao, with me—we take their leader!’ Guan Yu ordered.

They carved through the dwindling forces. Soon, only a dozen enemies remained.

‘I warned you,’ Guan Yu coldly intoned.

Wang Xiaorong loosed another bolt, but the leader dodged again. Recognizing defeat, he shouted, ‘Retreat! Now!’

‘Too late.’ Guan Yu drew his pistol. A thunderous *bang—* the leader tumbled from his horse, shoulder bleeding.

‘Told you you’d stay,’ Guan Yu said, looming over him.

‘Y-You... ambushed me with hidden weapons!’ the leader spat.

‘Hypocrite! You ambushed us disguised as merchants!’ Guan Yu retorted. ‘Your “elite” brigade picks fights, then whines when outmatched?’

Zou Wuxiao urged execution, but Guan Yu spared him. ‘Return to Yu Kong. See if he spares *you* after this failure.’

**Chapter 4091: Shifting Blame**

As the battered leader fled, the group regrouped. News of the ambush spread, compounding public outrage over recent Imperial Guard scandals. Even children sang mocking rhymes.

In the capital, the Emperor raged. Yu Kong was dragged before the throne after forty brutal lashes.

‘Explain this disgrace!’ the Emperor thundered, as the court awaited Yu Kong’s groveling defense...
