Though many said as much, a few still chose to bet on "small," believing Guan Yu's predictions unreliable. Despite his hefty silver wagers, he rarely won, so they saw no reason to follow his lead.

The dealer shook the dice cup and barked, “Place your bets and withdraw your hands! Hurry up, don’t hesitate! Don’t waste everyone’s time—we’re opening soon!”

Guan Yu knew the dealer would force a “small” outcome this round. With most bets on “large,” the house would never let “large” win. But Guan Yu was determined to flip the result.

As the dealer prepared to reveal the dice, a hand slammed onto the cup, jostling the dice inside. Guan Yu sensed the original points—five, five, five—had shifted to one, one, two: the smallest possible “small.” Clearly, the dealer aimed to claim all bets on “large.”

Channeling his internal energy, Guan Yu pressed a hand to the table’s edge. A surge of energy struck the cup, flipping the dice to three, three, six—twelve points: “large.”

Distracted, the dealer lifted the cup and nearly cried “one, one, two—small!” before freezing in disbelief at the revealed numbers.

She’d dealt here for days on end, never once slipping up. Yet now, this inexplicable twist—

“Hahaha! Told you it’d be large! Pay up, quick!” Guan Yu laughed boisterously, swiftly blending into the crowd’s excitement.

The female dealer and her bookkeeper exchanged glances but stayed silent. This loss stung—only a handful had bet “small,” while the wealthy young master alone wagered a hundred taels on “large.” A devastating payout.

Yet they blamed mere misfortune, resolving to recoup losses cautiously.

**Chapter 4827: A Massive Loss**

Guan Yu tallied his gains: one hundred taels won, minus fees, still left him down a hundred. This round, he’d show no mercy. Eager to flee this den of vice, he shoved his remaining two hundred taels onto “large.”

Fresh off a “large” win, the crowd buzzed with glee, eagerly following Guan Yu’s lead.

“Large! It’ll be large again! Follow me—no mistakes!” Guan Yu bellowed.

Superstitious gamblers, emboldened by his hefty stake, piled on. Even if they lost, matching his two hundred taels felt worthwhile. Surely, this man was a prodigy, betting with uncanny precision.

Bets on “small” dwindled to a meager dozen taels—practically negligible.

“Bets closed!” The dealer’s voice lacked its earlier vigor, though she vowed to reclaim losses.

Guan Yu listened closely. The dice cup’s rattle hinted at an all-consuming “triple”—the house’s ruthless ploy to sweep even the paltry “small” bets.

Typical stakes here were modest, rarely exceeding fifty taels. Yet the last round’s hundred-tael loss to a single player—now doubling down—demanded drastic measures. A “triple” would clean the board.

The dealer had pre-set the dice to triple ones. Sensing this, Guan Yu waited. As the cup lifted, his internal energy struck like a distant ox-taming palm, jolting the dice.

A faint clatter—still one, two, five: “small.” Another pulse. Now two fives. Combined, “large” was assured.

“Hah! Large again! Pay up!” Guan Yu crowed as the cup revealed five, five, two—twelve points.

“Told you! Follow me—today’s luck can’t be stopped!” He laughed, deliberately stoking attention. Let the crowd win with him—until the Cao family took notice.

Disguised as he was, even Cao agents wouldn’t recognize him. He’d stir chaos, vanish, and leave them baffled.

The dealer stared numbly at the dice, counting each face. Five. Five. Two. Impossible. Two catastrophic losses—both “large.”

“Pay now! We’re waiting!” Guan Yu pressed.

“Quit stalling! You took our silver fast enough!” others jeered. Riding Guan Yu’s streak, they’d all profited—he’d recouped losses and gained a hundred extra.

The dealer and bookkeeper shared uneasy looks. Her flawless technique had never faltered—until today.

Determined, she shook the cup again. Guan Yu held back, noting their suspicion. Mere silver losses made them skittish?

He cared not. Bigger stakes suited him. Slapping four hundred taels on “large,” the mob followed blindly, some staking their last coin.

The dealer shook the cup, eyeing Guan Yu coldly. The crowd chanted “large!”—he joined, amplifying the frenzy.

This time, none doubted. All piled on “large.”

As the cup landed, Guan Yu listened. Last round’s triple ones had become triple sixes—a wolf in sheep’s clothing. A “triple” would let the house devour all.

But Guan Yu wouldn’t yield. Triple sixes? A nudge would suffice. Pressing the table, his energy jostled one die.

The dealer watched him sharply but missed his subtle strike.

**Chapter 4828: Impatience**

“Bets closed! Will it stay large?” The dealer slapped the cup, adjusting the dice—once, twice, thrice—until they settled at one, two, three: “small.” With none betting “small,” this equaled a triple sweep.

She’d originally rolled triple sixes, but someone had altered them. An expert lurked here. Her hand stayed atop the cup, probing for the culprit.

Three consecutive anomalies—no accident. Yet she’d detected nothing. This foe was skilled. Her backers wouldn’t tolerate such sabotage. The culprit would be crippled once exposed.

Guan Yu sensed the dice at two, four, five: eleven—“large.” “Open it already!” he roared, slamming the table. Each strike pulsed energy, shifting the dice.

The dealer stalled, observing. His table-thumping vibrations masked his manipulations—a masterstroke.

“Hurry!” the crowd clamored.

The bookkeeper slipped away, likely summoning reinforcements. Let them come—Guan Yu welcomed the confrontation.

The dealer strained to flip the dice to “small.” Guan Yu countered, their energies clashing through the cup. The dice spun wildly, audible to all.

A martial artist! Her internal energy rivaled his—explaining her toned allure.

Their duel escalated. The dice whirled faster, confounding the crowd.

Time pressed—Cao agents would arrive soon. Guan Yu resolved to end this.

With a surge, he blasted her hand off the cup. Four, four, three—eleven points: “large.”

“Hah! Large again! Follow me—feast tonight!” Four hundred taels became eight hundred.

The dealer staggered back, outmatched. “You dare scheme here?!” she spat.

Guan Yu smirked. “Proof? Pay up!”

**Chapter 4829: Defiance**

The mob erupted. “Pay! No delays!”

Reluctantly, the dealer disbursed winnings. Guan Yu scooped his eight hundred, ignoring fees. Time to shift tables.

“This sore loser’s no fun! Let’s move!” he declared.

The crowd surged after him. At the next table, he slammed his eight hundred on “large.” “Bet big—it’s certain!”

Chaos ensued as players shoved to follow. The new dealer gaped—eight hundred taels! Unprecedented.

“Bets closed!” he announced weakly, bewildered by the frenzy.
