“Forget it. Whether she’s a man or woman isn’t important to you. Weren’t you seeking her help? Tell me! I can assist you too!”

“You?” Guan Yu eyed Cao Xiping skeptically. Though the man appeared mature, nothing about him inspired confidence. Moreover, Guan knew nothing of his background. Relying on such a person felt utterly unreliable!

As if reading his mind, Cao retorted indignantly: “What? Looking down on me?”

“A bit,” Guan admitted bluntly.

Cao clutched his chest dramatically. “Must you be so harsh? No wonder she avoids you! Let me tell you—there’s nothing I can’t accomplish in Taiwan. Speak now or I leave!”

“Wait!” Guan hastily blocked his path. “A friend of mine was kidnapped here. I meant to seek her help, but since you insist—find her for me!”

“Kidnapping? Such trivial matters warrant her attention?” Cao sneered. “If she learns you disturbed her for this, you’ll be shown the door!”

“Trivial?” Guan stared incredulously. “The kidnapper is Wan Qianshan!”

“Wan Qianshan? That explains it!” Cao exclaimed, then dropped a bombshell: “If he’s involved, just demand the hostage! Let me locate him first.”

Producing a palm-sized computer, Cao began typing furiously.

“This is how you track people?” Guan marveled.

“Exactly! Don’t underestimate this device—it contains every Taiwanese citizen’s data with real-time tracking. Give me your friend’s details and I’ll find her too, albeit with more effort.”

“Hacker!”

Guan and Lin Dong exchanged knowing glances. In this digital age, locating someone through ID or phone signals wasn’t difficult—except such cutting-edge technology remained beyond civilian reach, reserved for government agencies or elite hackers like Cao.

Guan’s mind raced. Intelligence was crucial in business, politics, and underworld dealings. Recruiting this talent could grant invaluable vision.

“Brother Cao,” he began smoothly, “your hacking skills are impressive.”

“Naturally! I’m among the world’s top five hackers!” Cao’s eyes gleamed with pride.

“Ever considered surpassing number one?” Guan tempted.

“Who wouldn’t? But reaching the pinnacle requires more than skill—funding for advanced research, breaching impregnable defenses, sparring with masters...” Cao sighed. “Money I have, but true masters either retire or get recruited. Today’s rankings lack real challenges—none replicate feats like breaching the Pentagon or hijacking U.S. satellites.”

Seizing the opening, Guan proposed: “What if I arrange meetings with mainland’s top hackers? Join me there.”

“You know mainland masters?” Cao’s eyes lit up. Mainland hackers were legendary for their cyberwars against Western powers. Learning from them would elevate his craft.

“Excellent connections,” Guan lied unblushingly. In truth, he planned to leverage contacts like Dongfang Mu or Wen Baoguo later. “Well? Join me?”

“Yes! Absolutely!” Cao nodded eagerly. Passing this opportunity would be idiocy.

Guan smiled vulpinely. This recruit would bolster his intelligence network. Observing silently, Lin Dong rolled his eyes at the smooth persuasion.

“Now,” Guan pressed, “find me Li Xi. She arrived three days ago.”

“ID number?” Cao’s fingers danced across keys.

“None.”

“How then?” Cao glared.

Grinning, Guan leaned back. “Your problem. Three hours.”

Cao nearly stormed out. This oppression began before even reaching the mainland! Yet the lure proved irresistible. “I’ll trace Wan first!”

Soon, Cao’s screen showed Wan’s location matching theirs—the same hotel.

“Mistake?” Guan frowned. Had Wan followed them?

“Questioning my expertise?” Cao bristled.

Backpedaling, Guan urged: “Just find Li Xi. Leave Wan.”

As Cao resumed work, Guan signaled Lin Dong, who returned minutes later.

“Done?” Guan asked.

“He’ll suffer... temporarily,” Lin confirmed. True to Guan’s style, retribution came via special techniques rather than death.

Meanwhile, Wan Qianshan—dining with Immigration Director Wang—suddenly clutched his stomach. Excusing himself repeatedly, he made thirty bathroom trips in half an hour before collapsing in a stall.

“Damn! What did I eat?” he groaned, unaware Lin had spiked his food.

Outside, aide Xiao Hou reported: “Boss, Director Wang wants to leave!”

Cursing the ungrateful official, Wan forced himself out—only to collide with Guan in the corridor.

“Rescuing Manager Li yourself?” Wan sneered weakly.

“Save your concern,” Guan coldly retorted. “Enjoy the laxatives. Next time, it’ll be poison. Harm Li Xi, and you’ll regret existing.”

Chapter 1052: Locating Li Xi

Two hours later, Guan prodded: “Top hacker stumped?”

Sweat-drenched Cao exploded: “You gave zero information! Finding a mainlander here is needle-in-haystack! Try it yourself!”

Guan placated: “Your efforts get us to the mainland faster. Those legendary hackers await...”

Reinvigorated, Cao finally triumphed. “Kaohsiung’s Xiaoyi Road. Three-hour drive.”

As they departed, Wan—still toilet-bound—ordered Li Xi’s relocation and called Director Wang: “Five million NTD transfers now. Detain Guan Yu’s group.”

Guan’s convoy raced toward Kaohsiung, unaware Wan’s bribes already mobilized Taiwan’s immigration authorities against them.
