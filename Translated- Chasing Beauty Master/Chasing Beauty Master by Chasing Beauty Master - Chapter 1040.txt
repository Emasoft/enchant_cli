Xue Jing’s forehead was beaded with cold sweat. Luo Bo’s stealth capabilities were alarmingly formidable. Despite her heightened vigilance, she had failed to detect his presence. Though an ominous premonition had prickled her instincts, her reaction came too late. Had Second Only to Wolf not arrived in time to intercept Luo Bo’s strike, that blow would have grievously wounded her.

Guan Yu’s tension eased upon seeing Second Only to Wolf. Recalling the earlier ambush with hidden projectiles, Guan Yu had summoned Second Only to Wolf for covert protection, fearing further sneak attacks. With such guardianship, Guan Yu felt invulnerable—short of being shelled by artillery, nothing could harm him now.

Second Only to Wolf declared coldly, “Luo Bo, I’ve no desire to clash today. Withdraw while you can. You gain nothing here.”

Luo Bo chuckled lightly. “Little Wolf, your bravado has grown over the years. But does your skill match your tongue? Step aside. Whether he’s your brother-in-law or not, my target *will* fall.”

“Enough talk.” Second Only to Wolf leveled his long battle blade. “Let us see if you still deserve respect.”

Without another word, Luo Bo drew a strange awl-like weapon from his sleeve—a half-meter steel spike glinting lethally in the darkness.

Crimson aura erupted around Second Only to Wolf as his internal energy materialized. Luo Bo mirrored the display, flashing forward in a blur. Their weapons collided in a shower of sparks, the concussive force blasting bystanders backward.

Guan Yu and Xue Jing leapt from their car roof, retreating from the shockwaves. “Impressive progress,” Luo Bo snarled, launching another assault. “Let’s see you keep pace!”

Their blades danced—a deadly whirlwind of strikes and parries. Years ago, Luo Bo had deemed Second Only to Wolf an unworthy junior. Now, the tables had turned. Unbeknownst to Luo Bo, stagnation, not the other’s growth, had eroded his own prowess.

“Too slow!” Second Only to Wolf’s blade sliced toward Luo Bo’s arm. Forced into retreat, Luo Bo barely twisted aside, the edge grazing his flank.

**Chapter 2659: Ease**

“Close call…” Luo Bo muttered, refocusing. Their battle cleared a crater-like space, overturned cars testifying to the unleashed power.

Sun Xu’s face purpled with rage at the failed assassination. “Useless ‘master’! Can’t even eliminate one man!” His mistress’s humiliation and territory losses fueled his fury.

Ge Yinglai fretted over reports of his ravaged businesses—years of effort reduced to rubble. Guan Yu’s cunning diversion had left their forces outmaneuvered.

The tide turned decisively. Sun Xu’s 500-strong mob withered against the cultivators’ stamina. Most remaining fighters belonged to the Freedom Organization, though even Yu Gang members bore injuries.

Qiongsi and Shen Sheng held their ground through seamless teamwork. Big Beard and Xiao Bai’s coordination proved flawless—strike, retreat, flank. In contrast, Qiongsi struggled against six elites, yet still dominated.

Guan Yu surveyed the field. Wei Hongwei and Wang Hu reported mission completion. With victory assured, he ordered the final 50 guards to seize Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai.

The fresh fighters sliced through exhausted opponents like scythes through wheat. Sun Xu’s bellowed orders went unheeded as his men scattered.

“Run, you fool!” Ge Yinglai dragged Sun Xu, but cultivators blocked their escape. Sun Xu crumpled under a kick, a blade at his throat. “M-mercy! Watch the steel!”

Ge Yinglai lasted mere moves before a backslash felled him.

“Call off your dogs,” the captain growled, “or die piecemeal.”

Luo Bo, realizing his charges were captured, fought with desperation. Second Only to Wolf pressed the advantage, blades singing a lethal aria.

**Chapter 2660: Negotiable**

A flash—Second Only to Wolf vanished. Guan Yu recognized the technique that had slain Qing Bo’s martial sister.

Luo Bo paled, backpedaling as he shielded his heart with a steel flask. The blade struck true, shattering the flask but blasting Luo Bo backward, blood spewing.

Mercy stayed Second Only to Wolf’s killing strike. Instead, his blade severed Luo Bo’s Achilles’ tendon before a kick sent the man sprawling.

The battlefield resembled a charnel house—limbs scattered, blood painting the streets. Guan Yu strode through crimson puddles to where Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai knelt.

“Behold your handiwork.” Guan Yu’s voice froze souls.

Sun Xu rasped through pain: “Kill me, but spare Xia… She carries my child.”

Guan Yu’s laughter held no warmth. “Plead? When would you have shown *my* women mercy? Sever their right hands.”

Screams rent the air. “Wait! We can negotiate!” Ge Yinglai shrieked before his hand thudded to the ground.

“Now the right feet,” Guan Yu ordered impassively. Fresh howls echoed as the maimed duo were dumped at their convoy.

After dispatching the wounded for treatment, Guan Yu’s forces marched the captives to the Feng Estate.

**Chapter 2661: Unwelcome Guest**

At the Feng gates, a hundred prisoners knelt in macabre procession. Guards stammered into phones: “Y-young Master! Guan Yu’s here with an army!”

Feng Shaoye scoffed but paled upon reaching the south wing’s vantage. The sea of broken men confirmed his fears—Guan Yu’s retribution had arrived.
