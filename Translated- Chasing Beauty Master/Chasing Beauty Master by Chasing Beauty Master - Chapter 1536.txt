Wang Jun’s casual display of skill caught the attention of the onlookers, who began whispering among themselves. “Who would have thought this young man is so formidable? Was that magic he just used? Blowing someone away with a wave—only a living immortal could possess such power!”

Though it was merely a common spell, these ordinary townsfolk had never witnessed anything like it. This simple demonstration further cemented their belief in Wang Jun’s extraordinary abilities.

“A living immortal! I must have my fortune told too!” A young girl hurried forward. Her exclamation drew even the crowd watching street performances, soon surrounding Wang Jun’s table.

Seeing the growing throng, Wang Jun grew uneasy. *This money-making method was a poor choice—too slow.*

**Chapter 3983: Fortune Telling (Part 2)**

Fortune-telling required individual sessions, earning coin only after each reading—unlike street performers who could collect donations from a crowd in moments. But Wang Jun was merely amusing himself, not truly in need of funds. The girl approached timidly, asking, “Master, may I sit?”

“Of course, young lady. Please.” Wang Jun smiled courteously. His tone shifted with his audience—polite for this youthful petitioner, unlike the earlier drunkard who deserved no such gentleness.

Once seated, the girl fidgeted nervously. “Master, I... I wish to ask about my future husband. Is that permissible?” Her cheeks flushed as she spoke.

Wang Jun maintained his solemn demeanor. “Certainly. Please wait a moment.” Retrieving a brush and ink, he instructed, “State your birth date and time according to the traditional Chinese calendar.”

Examining the characters, Wang Jun noted the girl was merely fifteen—surprisingly young to ponder matrimony. Though plain in appearance, her gentle temperament and modest attire suggested a humble background. *She’d fare best with a steady, unwealthy suitor,* he judged.

“Your八字 indicates late marriage to a tolerant man of modest means,” he declared. “Wealthy scions would only bring you hardship.” In this martial world, rich young masters were notorious philanderers who disregarded wives—especially meek ones like her.

“But I yearn for wealth!” the girl protested. “Could you alter my fate? My family’s poverty...”

Wang Jun hid his frown. *Sacrificing happiness for gold? Troublesome.* Her plain looks offered little bargaining power beyond youth—a commodity some older men might purchase.

“Solutions exist,” Wang Jun intoned. “Fifteen-year-old Rooster sign... Let me consult the mysteries.” Spreading paper on the table, he commanded, “Place your hand here.”

As she complied, Wang Jun nodded gravely. “This requires ritual intervention.” He took a mouthful of water and sprayed it onto the paper with a *pfft*. The sheet burst into flames, startling bystander Xiao Zhi.

*Must he play with fire so dramatically?* Xiao Zhi thought, eyeing the spectacle.

The burning paper revealed a crimson handprint before being deposited in an incense burner. Wang Jun then ignited his index finger—burning steadily like a lighter—to torch the birth chart, astonishing the crowd.

“A true immortal!” someone gasped. “Fire cannot harm him!”

The enthralled girl received ashes wrapped in yellow cloth. “Bury this where none will find it. Your wish shall manifest.”

“Truly? Thank you, Master!” She pressed silver into his palm before departing, treasure clutched to her chest.

Wang Jun pocketed the coin, musing *How easily fools part with wealth.* After her exit, he announced, “Accurate fortunes! Wealth, marriage, destiny—all revealed!”

The girl’s enthusiastic endorsement drew fresh petitioners. Next came a woman in her twenties, swaying hips betraying motherhood. Her fine clothes lacked proper aristocratic adornments—likely new purchases for show.

“What troubles you, madam?” Wang Jun inquired, earning Xiao Zhi’s glare—*Why not ‘miss’ for this beauty?*

Glancing nervously at the crowd, the woman whispered, “Does my husband... keep mistresses?”

Xiao Zhi nearly choked suppressing laughter. *Infidelity consultations now?*

Wang Jun tread carefully. “Madam, such matters—”

“Please!” she begged. “I lie awake tormenting myself!”

Relenting, Wang Jun inquired about her husband’s occupation. “A minor constable,” she replied. “Always ‘working late,’ leaving me with the children...”

Wang Jun deduced the truth—either overworked (unlikely in lazy bureaucracies) or philandering. “When men shun home,” he parried, “their hearts dwell elsewhere. Whether person or pursuit, I cannot say.”

Xiao Zhi marveled at the diplomatic phrasing—*‘beloved thing’ indeed!*

“Can our marriage endure?” the woman pressed. “Or can you sever his outside ties?”

Wang Jun demurred. “I foresee bonds, not break them.” Requesting family birth dates, he rolled the papers into a cylinder tied with thread. “If flames sever this, your union ends. If not...”

Xiao Zhi nearly snorted—*Thread always burns!* Yet as fire consumed the papers, the charred thread remained intact. “Your marriage persists,” Wang Jun declared, secretly advising tolerance over confrontation.

Overjoyed, the woman paid silver. “Will you remain here for future consultations?”

“Destiny governs meetings,” Wang Jun intoned, pocketing his earnings.

**Chapter 3984: Deceptive Tricks**

Xiao Zhi burned with curiosity about the unburned thread—a mystery to unravel later. Meanwhile, the crowd surged forward, now thoroughly convinced of Wang Jun’s divine powers. Skeptics converted by eyewitness accounts jostled for attention, disregarding orderly queues in their eagerness.

**Chapter 3985: Destined Reunion**

As night deepened, Wang Jun’s table became the town’s focal point—every soul yearning for glimpses of fate, unaware they courted not an immortal, but a cunning showman.
