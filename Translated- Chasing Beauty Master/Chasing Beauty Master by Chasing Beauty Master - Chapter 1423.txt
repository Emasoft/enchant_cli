Originally, the proprietress's family business mainly focused on manufacturing carriages and rarely engaged in other woodworking ventures. However, two months prior—when temperatures had not yet warmed—wooden incense burners became fashionable for a time. When lit with aromatic resins, these burners emitted a fragrance through heated wood.

This scent carried a subtle woody aroma said to benefit health, and the burners came in diverse designs.

**Chapter 3698: A Heart Full of Resentment**

Crafting such incense burners happened to be Da Changlian’s specialty, leading to booming business during that period. Wealthy households, particularly those keen on health preservation methods, flocked to Da Changlian’s workshops for their skilled artisans. Countless patrons purchased various wooden burners.

Later, upon discovering this trend, the proprietress demanded Da Changlian lend her one of his craftsmen. However, creating these burners required not only exceptional woodworking skills but also specialized heating tools resembling cannon-shaped devices. Wood had to be slowly roasted over flames until achieving precise curvature and texture.

At the height of Da Changlian’s prosperity, the proprietress insisted on borrowing his artisans. Though Da Changlian reluctantly complied, knowing her lack of proper tools would hinder quality, the outcome infuriated him. After two days without producing a single burner, the proprietress had the craftsman severely beaten and accused Da Changlian of deception. Forced to appease her with lavish gifts, Da Changlian’s workshop still lacks a carpenter to this day.

Recalling these injustices, Da Changlian’s resentment flared anew. Over the years, the proprietress had extorted countless sums from him. Others too harbored grievances, but none dared oppose her—her official connections and rent-free shop in this government-managed district granted her unchecked authority. Merchants here paid exorbitant rents while enduring her tyranny, relying on her to mediate disputes through local officials.

The proprietress ruled like an official proxy, flanked by burly enforcers. Even recent events underscored her power: when a wealthy buyer from out of town clashed with a young coffin shop owner over pricing, the proprietress summoned guards to arrest the troublemakers, cementing her reputation as a community protector.

Now, as tensions rose with Guan Yu, bystanders weighed aiding the proprietress against fear of retribution. Though many resented her cruelty, her government ties compelled compliance.

**Chapter 3699: No One Moves**

“You seem remarkably calm,” the proprietress taunted Guan Yu. “Have you gone numb with fear? I’ll warn you—officials are coming. Apologize now, and perhaps I’ll show mercy.”

“A jest,” Guan Yu countered. “I’ve told you—the authorities have greater concerns today. Are you certain your contacts will arrive?”

“Who backs you in the government?” he pressed. “What gives you the audacity to abuse official power?”

The proprietress scoffed. “Magistrate Zhou himself is my brother-in-law. Do you truly believe…”

“Even if they come,” Guan Yu interrupted, “do you think I fear petty bureaucrats? I remain here only to spare your lackeys harm.”

As time stretched without officials arriving, doubt crept in. An elder merchant whispered, “Proprietress, something is amiss. By now, your messenger should have returned with guards.”

**Chapter 3700: Nonsense**

“What catastrophe could strike the yamen?” the proprietress muttered. “Magistrate Zhou dying? Preposterous!”

Guan Yu’s confidence unnerved her. Unbeknownst to her, Magistrate Zhou lay poisoned—a slow-acting toxin administered by someone close. By the time symptoms surfaced, no remedy would exist.

As arguments continued, a horseman finally galloped in—the missing messenger, dust-covered and breathless. His arrival would unveil the truth brewing in the yamen...
