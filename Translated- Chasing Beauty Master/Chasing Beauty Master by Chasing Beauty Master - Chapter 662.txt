Halting the men’s futile quarrels, Wang Manqing informed Guan Yu that she had seized the opportunity during their conflict with Meng Fancheng and others to bring him to the police station. Her true intention was to request his assistance should the police require his help in the future.

If Wang Manqing’s stated purpose in coming to Y City was indeed to combat malicious mutants, it aligned with Guan Yu’s own intentions. He readily agreed but stipulated he would only intervene in cases involving mutants, refusing to meddle in affairs concerning ordinary humans or pseudo-psychics.

In truth, Wang Manqing had orchestrated this meeting to confirm Guan Yu’s identity—the same Guan Yu who entered the Divine Miracles twenty years ago—and report back to her family. With that settled, she allowed Guan Yu and Hou Jinshun to leave, assuring them the police would handle matters with the Black Dragon Society.

As she escorted the two out of the station, Wang Manqing casually mentioned that several mutants from the Storm Society had been killed in Y City by unidentified individuals, hinting the faction might dispatch powerful members to investigate.

She knew Guan Yu was the only one in Y City capable of slaying two second-class mutants and a third-class mutant simultaneously. Yet she refrained from stating it outright, and Guan Yu feigned ignorance with a chuckle before departing.

Surprised by Hou Jinshun’s natural aptitude for cultivation and rapid progress, Guan Yu imprinted the Minor Teleportation technique and a set of fist techniques into his mind, instructing him to practice further. Guan Yu then hurried off to attend classes at Mingyang School.

Though puzzled why Guan Yu masqueraded as a student at Mingyang—especially since the principal was his lover—Hou Jinshun, now revering Guan Yu to the point of worship, unquestioningly obeyed and returned to his training.

By the time Guan Yu arrived at school, the second class had already ended. Xu Ying anxiously asked if Meng Fancheng had harmed him. Guan Yu grinned, “Don’t forget how skilled I am in combat. A petty thug like Meng Fancheng isn’t worth my attention.”

Xu Ying’s attitude toward Guan Yu had transformed entirely. Gazing at his nonchalant demeanor, her eyes sparkled with admiration. “Guan Yu, I’ve begged my family to let me study ancient martial arts, but they refuse. They say many now inject that mysterious serum to become pseudo-psychics. Are you a psychic too? If not, how are you so strong? Could you teach me self-defense? Next time Meng Fancheng spouts nonsense, I’ll thrash him myself!”

Sensing Xu Ying’s extraordinary background yet unwilling to probe her mind, Guan Yu agreed to teach her some techniques when time permitted. Delighted, she nodded repeatedly.

After school, Liu Shilei called, summoning Guan Yu to a French restaurant named Justine to meet someone.

Having skipped lunch together earlier—Liu Shilei had been at the airport—Guan Yu’s heart raced at the thought of meeting this mystery guest. An intense premonition told him it would be someone familiar.

Could it be Du Xiaojuan arriving from the capital? The possibility consumed him. Unable to wait, he yearned to fly to Justine immediately.

Expanding his divine sense across dozens of kilometers, he pinpointed Liu Shilei’s location. As he prepared to soar through the skies, Xu Ying’s voice interrupted: “Guan Yu, where are you eating tonight? Let me treat you at my place as thanks for helping me earlier.”

Withdrawing his spiritual energy, Guan Yu declined, citing his reservation at Justine. Xu Ying pouted, “That’s a romantic French spot! Must be a date. Hmph! I’ve never invited a boy home before, and you reject me? Fine. You probably don’t know the way—I’ll have my driver take you.”

Flying in broad daylight would draw undue attention. Reluctantly, Guan Yu rode in Xu Ying’s car, urging the driver to hurry. His distracted agitation stirred jealousy in Xu Ying, who wondered what girl could eclipse her own charms.

**Chapter 1682: Reunion**

The car halted outside Justine. Before it fully stopped, Guan Yu burst out, vanishing like wind through the restaurant doors. Fuming, Xu Ying stamped her foot inside the vehicle. “Stupid Guan Yu! Didn’t even say goodbye!” The driver stared—since when did their aloof young mistress act so coy over an ordinary classmate?

Though desperate to arrive moments earlier, Guan Yu now hesitated at the threshold, heart pounding. A doorman welcomed him inside.

The sparse clientele parted as the door opened. There, radiant as memory, sat the face he’d yearned for across two decades.

Liu Shilei had informed Du Xiaojuan immediately upon reuniting with Guan Yu, knowing both women had endured twenty years of agonized longing. While Liu Shilei sought solace in their alma mater’s nostalgic halls, Du Xiaojuan drowned her sorrows in work, expanding Cosmic Group to staggering heights under her stewardship.

Countless suitors had pursued these peerless beauties, yet both remained faithful to their belief that Guan Yu would return. (*This novel is available on 800Book.Net for free download*)

Now, twenty years later, their faith bore fruit. Upon hearing Liu Shilei’s news, Du Xiaojuan nearly abandoned crucial European negotiations to rush home, concluding affairs with record speed before flying straight to Y City.

Their eyes met across the room—a gravitational pull erasing all else. Du Xiaojuan rose abruptly, spilling wine as she stumbled toward him. Guan Yu flashed forward, crushing her in an embrace.

Their three-hour meal spanned tales of Guan Yu’s mystical realm adventures and Du Xiaojuan’s corporate conquests. Calmer now, Liu Shilei teased, “At least he’s back. Oh, but sister—this scoundrel’s already seduced a teacher at my school! You must discipline him tonight!”

Guan Yu denied involvement with Sun Xiaoya, but Liu Shilei insisted. Du Xiaojuan bit her lip, faux-angry. “This philanderer probably bedded every beauty in that realm! But I can’t tame him alone—we’ll need teamwork, sister.”

Longing reignited, Guan Yu hurried them home. At Liu Shilei’s villa, staff dismissed, passions blazed anew.

Du Xiaojuan revealed she’d kept Guan Yu listed as Cosmic Group’s chairman despite bureaucratic pressure, steadfast in her belief. Now she sought to relinquish duties, but Guan Yu—unversed in modern corporate management—begged her continued stewardship.

Wealth meant little to one who’d walked mystical realms; Guan Yu now craved transcendent power and immortality.

The next day, skipping school to accompany Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu received a call from Liu Shilei: a beauty named Ouyang Yihan urgently sought him at campus. With mock jealousy, Liu Shilei quipped about his “growing harem,” though Du Xiaojuan remained unperturbed—content simply by his presence.

**Chapter 1683: The World’s Greatest**

At a teahouse meeting, Ouyang Yihan arrived flanked by bodyguards, surroundings thick with disguised Ouyang operatives. Her panic confirmed Guan Yu’s suspicion: either military pressure or the return of mutant Yu Zhengchun threatened her clan.

Before Guan Yu spoke, she pleaded: “Save our family! Only you can help now—it’s Yu Zhengchun or the military!”

Du Xiaojuan interjected, “Yu Zhengchun? One of China’s three first-class mutants? Notorious lecher—has he set sights on you?”

China’s top mutants comprised: Yu Zhengchun (stealth/assassination), Hong Wudi (combat/strength), and Meng Feilong (tracking/speed). All former felons—a serial rapist, drug lord, and legendary train robber respectively—recruited into government mutant programs before disappearing.

Noting Meng Feilong’s Y City origins, Guan Yu suspected Black Dragon Society ties through Meng Jingang.

Ouyang Yihan gaped at Du Xiaojuan’s detailed knowledge of classified mutant profiles. Recognition dawned: “You’re Cosmic Group’s CEO Du! You’re even more stunning than on TV! What’s your secret?”

Du Xiaojuan smiled. “Confidence. But Guan knows a rejuvenation technique—ask him.”

Internally, Guan cursed—the “technique” involved dual cultivation. Deflecting, he promised Ouyang beauty elixirs instead, pressing her to explain the crisis.

As Ouyang Yihan pouted “How stingy,” Guan’s gaze snapped to a bald man on the stairs—Yu Zhengchun himself, materializing undetected until now.

Guan Yu sneered, “So this vile toad dares covet a jewel like you? World’s greatest lecher indeed—he’d sicken a vulture!”

Du Xiaojuan laughed. “If you pity her so, marry her yourself! I won’t mind.”
