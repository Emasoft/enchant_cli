“After I tell you this, you must promise me not to speak of it to anyone, including Yingzi. Agreed?” Guan Yu spoke with utmost solemnity.

“What matter could be so grave that even Yingzi cannot know? You’re not… that kind of man, are you?” Second-to-Wolf asked while gesturing at Guan Yu.

Guan Yu immediately understood his implication – that he might be impotent. Rolling his eyes, he retorted, “Of course not! With all the women in Qiaoyuan District, do you truly think I’d be lacking?”

“Heh, I thought not. Very well, I swear upon my cultivation – whatever you reveal today shall never pass my lips. Should I break this oath, may my cultivation be utterly destroyed.” Second-to-Wolf pledged with ceremonial gravity.

Guan Yu nodded approvingly. For a cultivator like Second-to-Wolf, whose entire identity revolved around his martial prowess, this was the most binding vow imaginable. The man clearly intended to guard this secret with his life.

“The vortex you mentioned in my mind… I’ve seen it before,” Guan Yu dropped the revelation like a thunderclap. Second-to-Wolf blinked in confusion. “You’ve seen it? Then why haven’t you resolved it? That thing might be why your cultivation stagnates!”

“The connection is undeniable,” Guan Yu agreed. “But until today, I never knew this vortex existed within my own mind. Our internal energy flows unobstructed through the brain – how could I perceive its presence?”

“Wait – you didn’t know about the vortex until now? Then how could you have seen it elsewhere?”

“Indeed. I encountered this phenomenon not within myself, but in another. I call it… the Sealing Vortex.” Guan Yu’s voice lowered conspiratorially.

“Sealing Vortex? What sorcery is this?” Second-to-Wolf’s brows knitted in deepening confusion.

“There’s a girl in Qiaoyuan District named Zhang Han – you know her. She’s actually descended from the Demon Clan.” At this revelation, Second-to-Wolf’s eyes bulged, though he restrained himself from interrupting.

Guan Yu continued, “Her mother was demonkind, her father human. When Zhang Han was young, her fatally wounded mother used a unique demonic sealing technique. Before dying, she locked away her daughter’s childhood memories and cultivation within a vortex in her mind.”

“So she suffers amnesia like you?” Second-to-Wolf exclaimed.

“Worse,” Guan Yu revealed. “Zhang Han remembers nothing of her past – not even her cultivation methods.”

“By the heavens! Then your situation isn’t natural amnesia at all – someone sealed your memories too!” Realization dawned on Second-to-Wolf. “And your cultivation must be partially sealed! When I probed your mind earlier, the sheer terror emanating from that vortex… Your original power must have dwarfed mine!”

Guan Yu nodded grimly. This revelation reshaped everything – his “amnesia” was actually a demonic seal. But who would do this? And why?

The answer likely lay with Xue Jing. Only she could shed light on his past.

“Can this seal be broken?” Second-to-Wolf pressed eagerly. “If unleashed, you’d regain both memories and power!”

This explained Second-to-Wolf’s lingering unease around Guan Yu. Though appearing as a mere Second-Class Adept, Guan Yu’s latent presence always suggested hidden depths.

Indeed, current Guan Yu could hold his own against First-Class Adepts despite his apparent rank – an impossibility for normal cultivators. The disparity between Second and First-Class should be like child versus grown warrior.

“There is a way,” Guan Yu admitted. “A Jiezun Relic. Absorbing one can dissolve such seals. I used to possess such a relic… but employed it to save Patriarch Yang instead.”

Had he known then about his own seal, history might have unfolded differently – no encounter with Yang Conghan, Zhang Han, or Jin Hua. The irony stung.

“A Jiezun Relic?!” Second-to-Wolf gasped. “Those only form when Peak Jiezun experts perish! Such beings are legends – killing one is beyond imagination!”

Guan Yu nodded. “Exactly. I once had one through unknown means. My memories begin at Xue Jing’s home, the relic already in my possession.”

Second-to-Wolf’s eyes narrowed. “Did you… slay a Peak Jiezun master?”

“Presumably. How else would I obtain it?” Guan Yu’s frustration showed. Xue Jing claimed they’d been ambushed in Arctic ice caves during some forgotten mission. But her account felt incomplete – when pressed, she recalled being knocked unconscious early in the battle.

The truth remained veiled. Guan Yu resolved to confront Xue Jing properly upon return.

Noticing his darkening expression, Second-to-Wolf clapped his shoulder. “What’s done is done. Cherish the present – you’ve built a good life.”

Guan Yu forced a smile. “Worry not. I’m not one for despair. For Yingzi’s sake alone, I’ll endure.”

Their banter continued, but Guan Yu’s mind raced. The Feng Clan’s legendary Ten-Thousand-Year Demonic Domain might hold answers. If it could shatter Zhang Han’s seal, perhaps his own mystery would unravel through hers.

As they sparred later, Guan Yu’s anomalous power manifested – golden qi typical of First-Class Adepts shimmering around his fists. Second-to-Wolf recoiled mid-strike. “You call this Second-Class?!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “I never claimed normalcy. This ‘defect’ likely stems from partial unsealing.”

Second-to-Wolf abandoned the match, grumbling about unfair advantages. Yet both understood – the sealed vortex wasn’t just locking memories, but throttling a power that once shook heavens. When that dam finally broke, the tsunami would reshape everything.
