Siqi was taken aback. They had returned to Tiger Head Peak, which was teeming with disciples and servants. Why would she need to be the one to care for Guanyu?

She glanced at Xuanming, who pretended not to hear, clearly leaving the decision to the two of them.

“Guanyu, Master is still waiting for me at Convergence Peak. There are matters to attend to. It’s not that I’m abandoning you, but…” Siqi struggled to find a direct way to refuse.

She wasn’t unwilling to stay and care for him. In the secluded back mountains, with no outsiders around, she had tended to him without worry. But here, amidst so many people, if others saw her spending entire days in Guanyu’s room, gossip would inevitably spread.

Yet she couldn’t bring herself to refuse outright. She desperately hoped Xuanming would intervene—if he ordered her to stay, she could at least accept it with dignity.

**Chapter 3,336: No Drinking Allowed**

But Xuanming remained silent. Guanyu pressed, “Why return to Convergence Peak? As a top-four disciple in the Six Peaks Tournament who received the Merit Cauldron’s legacy, you’ll cultivate at Tiger Head Peak now. Convergence Peak isn’t your home anymore. Besides, how can you abandon me in this state? Would you truly trust others to care for me?”

Guanyu cared little for propriety. “Master, isn’t it right?” he continued. “Since Siqi has already tended to me for days, shouldn’t she see it through until I’ve fully recovered? Aid should be given thoroughly, no?”

Xuanming coughed lightly. “Though Siqi is now a Tiger Head Peak disciple, we don’t compel her to stay. While I hope she remains to care for you, I won’t stop her if she insists on leaving.”

Siqi fell silent, clearly at a loss. She wanted to stay but dreaded the rumors.

“How about this,” Guanyu suggested. “If Siqi dislikes Tiger Head Peak, I’ll move to Convergence Peak with her. She can tend to me there. Jinciyu Lang (Second to Wolf) will join us too. Chief Dai will surely welcome us.”

Siqi nodded eagerly. “Yes! That’s perfect. I’ll inform Master at once.”

After settling the plan, Siqi departed first. Returning to his room, Guanyu found Jinciyu Lang roasting meat and sipping wine.

“You’re back! Join me,” Jinciyu Lang grinned. “I nearly stormed the back mountains searching for you.”

“I knew you’d act rashly,” Guanyu said, waving a hand. “That’s why I insisted on returning. Elder Qing repeatedly warned me—no alcohol until my wounds heal. Drinking could worsen things.”

“No alcohol?” Jinciyu Lang chuckled. “Excellent! More for me. Stay disciplined for your recovery.”

Lying back, Guanyu focused on refining the turbulent spiritual energy within him. Mastering this surge would take time—for now, suppression was his only option.

“Jinciyu Lang,” Guanyu suddenly opened his eyes, “there’s something you should know.”

“Out with it,” the man replied, tossing a peanut into his mouth.

“The Merit Cauldron… it’s sentient. During the legacy transfer, it detected the seal in my mind and tried forcibly to remove it. The clashing energies nearly killed me. Without Xuanming and Elder Qing’s intervention, I’d have kicked the bucket.”

Jinciyu Lang frowned. “Why would the Cauldron oppose the seal?”

“Unknown. It seemed… personally affronted. But the struggle shrank the seal considerably.”

“So the Cauldron might actually break it? Remarkable!”

Guanyu shook his head. “Not easily. At its zenith, the Cauldron’s seven-colored energy only diminished the seal. Now dormant, its next peak cycle comes in sixty years.”

“Useless! We can’t wait six decades,” Jinciyu Lang scoffed, downing his wine.

“But the seal’s reduction restored some memories and cultivation,” Guanyu revealed.

Jinciyu Lang seized his wrist, then stared in shock. “Your cultivation… I can’t gauge it!”

“Obviously. I surpass you now.”

“Yet your current energy reserves are lesser. A paradox best left undiscussed. Still, you’re likely at lower First Grade Sovereign level.”

“More than that. I’ve truly unified magic and martial arts.”

Jinciyu Lang crunched another peanut. “This ‘dual cultivation’—is it truly as miraculous as they claim? Or just delusion?”

**Chapter 3,337: Divergent Paths**

The next morning, Xiao Zhi and Aze rushed to Guanyu’s room. After inquiries about his health, they boasted of their gains—Xiao Zhi especially, comparing himself relentlessly to Aze.

“Truthfully,” Guanyu asked, “what did you two gain?”

Aze scratched his head. “Before, I led most junior disciples in cultivation. Now, only you and Siqi outmatch me.”

“Don’t believe his boasts,” Xiao Zhi cut in. “I could still defeat him easily. Oddly, the Cauldron gave me alchemical knowledge instead of spells.”

While Aze’s spiritual energy and spell mastery had soared, Xiao Zhi found himself versed in crafting—a path he hadn’t anticipated.

“The Cauldron tailors gifts to one’s aptitude,” Aze explained. “It must’ve deemed you fit for alchemy.”

“An alchemist!” Guanyu exclaimed. “They’re revered! Master Zheng will be thrilled.”

Xiao Zhi remained skeptical. “How is memorizing recipes impressive?”

“You think you knew this before?” Aze retorted. “You only cared about roasted hare! This is the Cauldron’s doing.”

Guanyu nodded. “With time, you’ll master this. The knowledge unfolds as your cultivation grows.”

**Chapter 3,338: Mysterious Force**

“Guanyu,” Siqi entered, “Master sent me to escort you and Jinciyu Lang to Convergence Peak.”

Guanyu smirked. Chief Dai likely sought Jinciyu Lang’s presence.

“You’re leaving?” Xiao Zhi protested. “How will we visit? Male disciples can’t freely enter Convergence Peak!”

“Recuperate properly,” Guanyu advised. “We’ll meet once I’ve healed.”

As they departed, Siqi asked, “Will flight aggravate your injuries?”

“Just hold me tight,” Guanyu teased. Though her cultivation now ensured safety, she didn’t refuse.

Soaring above, they watched Jinciyu Lang’s ground-devouring strides. “Why can’t we fly at Tiger Head Peak, yet he runs freely?” Siqi wondered.

“I’ve wondered the same,” Guanyu mused. “What power restricts flight there?”

The mystery lingered as they crossed Wu Liang Bridge, Convergence Peak’s silhouette rising before them.
