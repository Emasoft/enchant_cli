At this moment, Xue Jing gracefully spun several times and darted into the fray, leaving fragrant afterimages in her wake. Even her combat stances were exquisitely elegant.

Xue Jing first entangled Little Hei, following Guan Yu's strategy. Since Little Hei appeared to possess Second-Class Zun Mid-Rank strength, Xue Jing might struggle to defeat him alone but could at least hold her ground.

Jones should have no problem handling Da Bai alone. After observing for a while, Guan Yu noticed Da Bai and Little Hei coordinated seamlessly. Jones and Xue Jing found no opportunity to confront them separately.

A problem emerged—Xue Jing couldn't lure Little Hei away for single combat. The twin brothers fought inseparably, their coordination so flawless it seemed they shared four arms and four legs. No matter how Jones and Xue Jing attacked, the twins always parried, dodged, and counterattacked expertly.

Guan Yu realized this默契 stemmed from years of joint cultivation. Their配合 transcended ordinary teamwork, requiring decades of shared experience—enhanced by being twins.

During combat, they needed no signals to anticipate each other's moves, executing无缝配合. Da Bai neared First-Class Zun strength while Little Hei remained Second-Class Zun. Combined with their默契, they temporarily stalemated Jones and Xue Jing.

As the battle expanded, Guan Yu saw Da Bai reluctantly draw his weapon—a crescent-shaped scimitar about thirty centimeters long. The gleaming blade danced in Da Bai's hands, deflecting Jones' assaults.

"We must separate them!" Guan Yu shouted. Continuing like this would endanger Xue Jing—Da Bai's blade had nearly slashed her earlier, barely dodged by her quick reflexes.

"Damned traitors!" Little Hei cursed, finally realizing Guan Yu had tricked them all along.

Though Jones fought fiercely, the twins focused attacks on Xue Jing, seeking weaknesses. Neutralizing her would make handling Jones easier.

To protect Xue Jing, Guan Yu ordered Jiang Fenju and subordinates to disrupt the twins' formation. Gripping his Desert Eagle, Guan Yu awaited shooting opportunities, but combatants moved too swiftly.

When Jiang Fenju's team joined, they finally split the twins apart. Separated, their combat effectiveness plummeted.

Jones wisely targeted Little Hei while Jiang Fenju's group helped Xue Jing contain Da Bai, planning to regroup after Little Hei's defeat.

The strategy proved effective. Alone against Jones, Little Hei quickly fell into劣势. Jones' lightning kick smashed his left shoulder, disarming one weapon. As Little Hei staggered back gasping, Guan Yu seized the moment—a gunshot echoed through the parking lot, bullet piercing Little Hei's right shoulder.

With metallic clang, Little Hei's remaining weapon fell. "Run! Don't mind me! Avenge me!" Da Bai roared hoarsely, eyes bloodshot. But as he tried breaking through, Jones and Xue Jing overwhelmed him.

Jiang Fenju wisely withdrew his men when experts clashed. Several injured subordinates were carried away for treatment.

Now two against one, Da Bai struggled desperately. The inseparable twins—who even shared wives—couldn't unleash their full strength separated. Though defending fiercely, Da Bai gradually weakened.

Kneeling with numb arms and bleeding shoulders, Little Hei snarled through pain: "Guan Yu! I'll remember this! You'll pay!"

Guan Yu coldly pressed the gun to Little Hei's temple: "You'll have no future chances. You should've investigated who you challenged."

As sweat dripped from Little Hei's brow, Guan Yu shouted: "Da Bai! Surrender or I blow his brains out!" Distracted, Da Bai took Jones' palm strike to the throat and Xue Jing's kick to the gut. He crashed into a SUV, denting its frame before collapsing.

Jones produced a dagger at Da Bai's throat. "Spare Little Hei! I'll grant any terms!" Da Bai pleaded bloodily.

Though moved by their loyalty, Guan Yu remained cold: "Mercy for Tenth Great Villains? You'd have killed me after getting the treasure map."

As Little Hei bled profusely, he gasped: "Just kill me!" Guan Yu briefly considered recruiting them but dismissed it—their notoriety made them unreliable.

Ordering Jiang Fenju: "Bind and execute them. No survivors." He sought to shield Xue Jing from witnessing deaths, but Jiang Fenju misinterpreted—stabbing Little Hei through the heart.

Xue Jing screamed, covering her eyes. "Monsters! You'll pay!" Da Bai roared before Jones' blade stilled him.

Guan Yu comforted Xue Jing: "They deserved this." After securing Da Bai in chains, Jones suggested: "Take her home. I'll handle cleanup."

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu pondered who leaked the treasure map rumor. Meanwhile, the Feng Family faced endless visitors and intruders—all seeking the map, their security bolstered by the Bill family.

Abandoning Feng Manor for now, Guan Yu focused on finding Poisonous Widow Ying Shangu. Remembering Golden Flower—another poison expert with light footwork—he messaged her for insights but received no reply.

As Dawn approached, Second-to-Wolf searched industrial zones fruitlessly for Ying Shangu, unaware of Guan Yu's earlier kidnapping.

Next morning, Wei Hongwei's call interrupted Guan Yu's sleep. "What now?" he growled.
