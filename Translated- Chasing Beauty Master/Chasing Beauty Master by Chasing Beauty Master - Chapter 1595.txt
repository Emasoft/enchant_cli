There was another man—a burly, dark-skinned fellow with a bald head. Guan Yu was taken aback. *Another Realm Sovereign expert?* He couldn’t discern the man’s cultivation level, which meant two possibilities: either this man was also a Realm Sovereign, or he practiced an obscure, unconventional path that defied normal detection.

Guan Yu’s mind raced. *What a spectacle this will be—two First-Class Sovereigns and two Realm Sovereigns, their exact tiers unclear, possibly even peak Realm Sovereigns. All four challenging the Swordless Immortal? They must truly intend to kill him.*

Xia Jian halted and turned. “Well? Are you all heading up the mountain too?”

“Indeed,” the bald man replied. “Care to join us for a round of车轮战 (wheel battle)?”

“Hahaha! Splendid! With companions like you, the journey won’t be lonely. Let’s go together,” Xia Jian said cheerfully, as if their shared target—the Swordless Immortal—naturally bound them as allies.

Guan Yu could no longer sit still. He turned to Wang Xiaorong. “Return and wait for me. I’ll follow them up to observe. Alright?”

Predictably, Wang Xiaorong refused. “Then I’m coming with you.”

“No, it’s too dangerous.”

“Then don’t go either! I won’t allow—”

Guan Yu grimaced. *Of all times for her to be stubborn!* He saw this as a rare chance to witness experts clash with the Swordless Immortal.

“Brother Du,” Guan Yu called, “could you watch over Xiaorong? I’d like to follow them. With so many going, surely there’s little risk?”

Du Teng nodded. “A sound plan. As they say: retreat when adversity strikes. The Swordless Manor isn’t hell itself, nor is the Swordless Immortal the King of Hell. He’s merely human—not omnipotent. Go. I’ll protect your younger sister-in-law.”

Guan Yu grinned, surprised by Du Teng’s sudden eloquence. As he stood to leave, Wang Xiaorong rose too. “If it’s truly safe, why not all go together?”

Her proposal left Du Teng and Zhenxiang silent. Though Zhenxiang lacked interest, she gently said, “A-Teng, if you wish to go, I’ll accompany you.”

Du Teng beamed. “To be understood is a blessing. Let’s join the spectacle and see this legendary ‘hell’ for ourselves.”

“Then we’ll face any danger together,” Wang Xiaorong insisted, determined to stay by Guan Yu’s side.

After settling matters, Guan Yu felt obliged to inform Prince Zou as a courtesy.

In the prince’s chambers, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong stood respectfully. “Old Cang,” Prince Zou said, “speak your request. Though my position is precarious, I’ll aid you however I can.”

Guan Yu bowed. The prince had witnessed his earlier duel with Du Teng and recognized his worth. Losing Guan Yu would be a severe blow.

“We simply wish to visit Swordless Manor and sought your blessing,” Guan Yu explained.

Prince Zou tensed. “Old Cang, your skill is remarkable, but the Swordless Immortal has reigned supreme for decades. Countless challengers have vanished. His power is peerless, and I fear—”

“I understand your concern,” Guan Yu interrupted. “But I’ve no death wish. Several experts have already ascended. We’ll observe from afar and return swiftly.”

Though reluctant, the prince sighed. “I cannot stop you. But tread carefully at Swordless Manor. Return safely.”

After thanking him, Guan Yu exited—only to find the others had already departed, leaving only Du Teng and Zhenxiang waiting.

“Brother Du, let’s proceed,” Guan Yu said.

At the mountain’s base, Guan Yu marveled. “From afar, Swordless Mountain seemed tall. Up close, it’s colossal! The Swordless Immortal’s reputation is well-earned.”

“And these stone steps!” Wang Xiaorong exclaimed. “Who would pave such a towering slope?”

The group climbed, but their predecessors had vanished ahead. Du Teng frowned. “I wonder if we’ll even pass the manor’s guards. Only then might we glimpse the Swordless Immortal.”

Wang Xiaorong giggled. “We should’ve waited! Let them exhaust the guards first.”

**Chapter 4137: Can’t Go On**

“Wishful thinking,” Du Teng said wryly. “Swordless Manor rejects mass challenges. If too many come, even the gates stay shut.”

“Then we’ll force our way in,” Wang Xiaorong declared.

Guan Yu nodded. “If necessary, we’ll breach it. The Swordless Immortal can’t slaughter us all at once. I’ll ensure our escape.”

Zhenxiang remained calm, content to stay with Du Teng regardless of danger. After two years apart, she cherished every moment—even with his Blood Toxin threatening to bestialize him.

As they climbed, Wang Xiaorong lagged. “I can’t… go on… Why build such a monstrous mountain? Challengers must collapse before even fighting!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Need a carry? I warned you.”

Wang Xiaorong grinned, leaping onto his back. “I didn’t know it’d be this grueling!”

Du Teng pointed ahead. “The summit nears. Rest at the gates before entering.”

The winding stone path, flanked by dense foliage, offered no shortcuts. Guan Yu frowned. “Brother Du, have you been here before?”

“Once. Guards turned me away, claiming the Swordless Immortal was in seclusion. A fortunate rejection—had I challenged him then, I’d be dead, never reuniting with Zhenxiang.”

**Chapter 4138: Look Down On You**

Reaching a windswept platform, they gasped. The final ascent featured steps forty centimeters high. Wang Xiaorong groaned. “Swordless Manor’s entrance better be worth this!”

The manor’s gates stood shut, flanked by weathered tombstones instead of guardian statues. A pristine plaque above read “Swordless Manor.”

Guan Yu knocked. No response.

“Maybe they’re done for the day,” Wang Xiaorong said hopefully.

Guan Yu pounded again. “We’ve come to challenge the Swordless Immortal! Open, or we’ll break in!”

Du Teng paled. “Don’t provoke them! This isn’t some common—”

“I don’t care!” Guan Yu roared. “If they won’t answer, we’ll make them!”

The silent gates loomed, as indifferent as the legends they guarded.
