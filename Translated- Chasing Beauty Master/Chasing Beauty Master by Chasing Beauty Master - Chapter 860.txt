“Moreover, if there were no mishaps, Auntie’s leg should now be able to lightly touch the ground. Earlier, Guan Yu had used his inner qi to reopen the meridians in her left leg, and her nerves have also strengthened considerably. However, this still isn’t enough.

For Auntie’s leg to fully recover, she needs at least half a year of rest. Even after a year or so, when her leg becomes functional again, she likely still won’t be able to exert too much force.

To achieve a complete cure, Guan Yu would need to repeat the treatment he just performed at regular intervals. Only through this method can Auntie’s leg fully heal.”

“Mom! Mom! Are you okay?” Qu Meimei asked anxiously. Since Guan Yu had advised against moving her, Meimei didn’t even dare touch her mother’s hand.

Guan Yu’s main concern was preventing others from disturbing Auntie’s leg. Though Auntie’s mental state seemed slightly improved, she remained utterly weak, as if even the strength to open her mouth and speak had abandoned her.

Some bystanders began to doubt inwardly: *Is this kid just showing off? He nearly killed her—can this even be called treatment?*

Yet most still held onto hope, wishing that after enduring such agony, her leg might finally heal.

Seeing her mother unresponsive, Qu Meimei urgently asked Guan Yu, “Brother Guan, how is my mother? Will her leg recover?”

Guan Yu nodded. “She’ll be fine. She’s simply exhausted.” As he spoke, he instructed Ling’er and Meimei to remove Auntie’s feet from the water basin and untie the ropes.

“Will Auntie’s leg truly heal?” Ling’er asked worriedly.

“It *will* heal, but it requires considerable time. After channeling my energy earlier, her left leg should now touch the ground without pain. However, to fully recover, she’ll need me to repeat the treatment ten more times,” Guan Yu replied calmly.

Hearing this, Qu Meimei grew anxious. *If Mom endured such torment only to remain unhealed, ten more sessions might kill her from the pain even if her leg recovers!*

Yet she knew Guan Yu meant well and refrained from criticism. “It’s alright. At least she can touch the ground without pain now. That alone will ease her suffering greatly. Thank you, Brother Guan.”

“Indeed, Auntie’s leg should no longer hurt as before—I’m certain of that,” Guan Yu affirmed. Privately, he considered: *If she wants me to continue treatments, she’ll need to move to City A. I can’t stay here indefinitely—this complicates things.*

“Meimei… fetch me some water…” Auntie’s faint voice drifted over. Without hesitation, Qu Meimei produced a bottle of mineral water from somewhere.

After drinking, Auntie’s complexion visibly improved. Guan Yu approached and suggested, “Auntie, try standing and taking a few steps now. Let’s see how it goes.”

Nodding, she gripped the nearby table and rose. Previously, her left foot had refused to touch the ground without excruciating pain, forcing reliance on a crutch.

This time, she clenched her teeth and let her left foot lightly graze the floor. The room watched breathlessly—a scene all too familiar to Qu Meimei.

In the past, her mother would instantly lift her foot and cry out in agony. But now, silence. The onlookers rejoiced.

Guan Yu smiled approvingly as Auntie exclaimed tearfully, “My foot can touch the ground! Meimei, look! My foot can touch the ground! Old man, come see—I can stand!”

Though elated, Guan Yu interjected, “Try walking a few steps. You can do it.”

Trembling with emotion—having forgotten the feeling of unaided movement—Auntie took one shaky step, then another. Though limping, she walked without crutches or pain.

Qu Meimei covered her mouth, stifling sobs as fat tears rolled down her cheeks. These were tears of joy: *For years, Mom relied on that hateful crutch. I know how much this meant to her.*

Her mother had yearned to contribute—to ease the family’s burdens—but her leg trapped her in dependency. Now, witnessing her walk freely overwhelmed Meimei.

Aunt Qing, equally thrilled, rushed to support her. “Stop walking now! Come rest on the kang.”

**Chapter 2220: The Thin Old Man**

Aunt Qing, overjoyed, hurried to steady her. “Enough walking! Come sit and rest.”

But Auntie, savoring her newfound mobility, insisted on continuing until Guan Yu intervened. “Auntie, your leg needs rest. Avoid using it unnecessarily. I recommend using the crutch for another month.”

Obedient through grateful tears, Auntie wept, “Thank you, Guan Yu. I never dreamed I’d stand alone again.”

The room erupted in applause, astonished by the young man’s skill.

“Young man, you’re a miracle worker!” exclaimed a gaunt elderly man. “My sister’s leg plagued her over a decade. Countless doctors failed—even the paranormal healer behind our village dared not treat it. Yet you succeeded!”

“You flatter me,” Guan Yu replied modestly as Qu Meimei urged her mother to sit.

“Alright, alright,” Auntie conceded, recalling the treatment’s torturous pain—like being sawn apart—yet now worth every agony.

“Mom, how do you feel now?” Meimei asked, tenderly wiping sweat from her mother’s brow.

“Wonderful—all thanks to Guan Yu.”

Ling’er, equally delighted, added, “Auntie, Brother Guan says ten more treatments will fully heal you. Why not come to City A tomorrow for his care?”

Auntie’s smile faded—not from fear of pain, but financial dread.

Qu Meimei brightened at the prospect of complete recovery, but her mother hesitated. “Guan Yu… if I stop treatments now, will my leg…?”

“Without continued care, improvement halts here,” Guan Yu explained gently. “Your left leg’s muscles atrophied from years of blocked meridians. Full recovery requires persistence.”

Auntie’s face fell. “Then let it be. I’ve grown accustomed.”

“Why refuse treatment when it’s possible?” Ling’er pressed.

Suddenly, Qu Shuangshuang—Meimei’s sister—burst in, home from school for the wedding. “Mom! Sis! Dad! I’m back!”

Noticing tear-streaked faces and the tense atmosphere, the girl froze. “What’s wrong?”

Guan Yu observed the newcomer—a stunning girl in faded school uniform and spotless white sneakers, her beauty transcending attire.

Clutching her daughters, Auntie confessed, “Ling’er, we appreciate your kindness… but our family’s finances… Meimei’s dowry emptied us. We can’t afford city treatments.”

Relieved it was merely a monetary issue, Guan Yu prepared to interject when Qu Meimei sobbed, “I’ll cancel the wedding! Use the money for your treatment!”

“Nonsense!” Auntie snapped. “A parent’s duty is their child’s future. Never speak such words again!”

“I’ll quit school too!” Shuangshuang joined tearfully.

“Silence!” Auntie roared, stunning the room. “I won’t hear this!”

Ling’er intervened, offering her savings. “Auntie, take this money. It’s yours—no need to repay.”

Guan Yu stopped her. “That won’t be necessary. I’ll cover all expenses.”

As Shuangshuang’s tearful gaze met Guan Yu’s, she blushed crimson. Noticing the luxury car outside earlier, she now connected it to this handsome stranger.

“Mom, who is he?” she whispered.

“This is Guan Yu, Ling’er’s employer. He drove here for your sister’s wedding.”

“Hello, handsome brother,” Shuangshuang greeted shyly.

Grinning, Guan Yu produced an elegant box. “A gift for you.”

Inside lay a gleaming Apple phone worth thousands. Shuangshuang’s eyes widened—delight and disbelief playing across her features.

**Chapter 2221: The Beloved Gift**

Qu Meimei wept bitterly. “If my wedding caused Mom’s suffering, I’d never forgive myself!”

Parents exist for their children—this truth hung heavy.

Auntie, furious at her daughters’ self-sacrificial offers, admonished them harshly. Yet the girls’ intentions stemmed from love.

Ling’er reassured about finances while Guan Yu finalized his pledge to fund everything.

Shuangshuang, momentarily distracted by Guan Yu’s presence, accepted the phone with trembling hands—her joy momentarily eclipsing sorrow. The sophisticated device symbolized possibilities beyond her humble world, its sleek contours a promise of connection to realms she’d only glimpsed from village margins.

As the family’s emotional storm subsided into tentative hope, Guan Yu’s calm authority anchored them. The road ahead remained long, but for the first time in years, it held light.
