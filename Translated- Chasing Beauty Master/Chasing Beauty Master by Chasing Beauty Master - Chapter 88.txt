“It’s been wonderful with those kids! Ah, let me tell you—they all listen to me! Some bring me water, others massage my shoulders. Hehe…”

Guan Yu shuddered inwardly. *Damn, this silly lass became a ringleader among children?* Well, given her petite frame, she’d easily dominate a group of seven- or eight-year-olds, maybe even take on five at once! No wonder she’d earned the glorious title of “Child Queen.”

“Go easy on those kids…” Guan Yu advised tactfully.

“Who’s tormenting them?! You have no idea—I buy them snacks, clothes, take them to zoos and amusement parks! They’re thrilled! Afterward, when I say I’m tired, they pamper me! Do I look like a bully to you?!” Du Xiaojuan retorted indignantly.

“Right, right… as long as they’re happy,” Guan Yu chuckled.

“Um… could you come back soon? The… the ten thousand you left me… it’s almost gone,” Du Xiaojuan mumbled timidly.

*This spendthrift! Ten thousand in two days?!*

“Out of money? Borrow some from Luo Cheng for now. We’ll settle it when I return,” Guan Yu said casually.

“No way!” she huffed.

“I didn’t waste it! Those kids had no new clothes or toys. I enrolled them in kindergartens and schools—all that costs money!” she explained hastily, fearing he’d think her frivolous.

“I get it. No worries—we’re rich now! Spend freely if it makes you happy,” Guan Yu reassured warmly.

*This naive, kindhearted girl can’t bear to see children suffer,* he mused wryly.

“I… I am happy. Just… I miss you,” Du Xiaojuan whispered.

Their casual chat, devoid of sweet nothings, lasted over an hour until Guan Yu’s worn-out phone grew warm. He finally urged her to hang up.

The next morning, at breakfast, Du Xueheng sat beside Guan Yu.

“Morning… Sleep well? Sobered up?” Guan Yu teased.

“I wasn’t drunk! That little alcohol couldn’t knock me out!”

“Why the stares? Really, I wasn’t! I remember everything from last night!”

His voice dwindled as he muttered, clearly having forgotten his antics.

Guan Yu sipped porridge and grinned. “Old Du… remember offering me your daughter last night?”

“What?!” Du Xueheng choked, eyes bulging as he struggled to recall.

“So it was all nonsense?” Guan Yu pressed.

“You said she’s a peerless beauty—so stunning flowers wilt and fish dive to avoid her! All lies?” Guan Yu smirked.

“I… I said that?” Du Xueheng gaped, unfamiliar with half the flowery phrases.

“Ignore him, Brother Guan! He was drunk. If you want a girlfriend, *I* have a daughter—a true stunner!” Li Yunshan interjected.

“What? *My* daughter’s prettier! Brother Guan, don’t listen to him! What exactly did I say last night?” Du Xueheng argued, seeing Guan Yu as the ultimate catch.

Watching the two bicker over their daughters’ charms, Guan Yu exchanged an exasperated look with Niu Le. *Are they fighting over a son-in-law?!*

“No need, really,” Guan Yu waved dismissively, already juggling relationships with Du Xiaojuan, Liu Shilei, and Feng Xin.

“Just joking! Look how nervous you are,” Li Yunshan laughed, secretly lamenting his daughter’s missed chance.

Seizing the moment, Du Xueheng slung an arm around Guan Yu. “Brother, my girl’s a knockout. Visit me in G City—I’ll introduce you!”

*He’ll probably never come anyway,* Du Xueheng thought, grinning smugly.

“What a coincidence—I study in G City! I’ll drop by,” Guan Yu declared.

Du Xueheng froze. His actual daughter had already eloped! *Where do I find another?!*

“Uh…” His face flushed crimson.

“What? Think my Guan Yu isn’t good enough?” Li Yunshan prodded.

Knowing Guan Yu had already whisked Du’s daughter away, Niu Le stifled laughter.

“Of course not! Yesterday’s offer stands!” Du Xueheng vowed, determined to drag his daughter back.

“Great! I’ll visit soon. Don’t hide her!” Guan Yu grinned.

*I’ll call my wife—we’ll haul that stubborn girl home!* Du Xueheng panicked inwardly.

Li Yunshan quipped, “Ditch his daughter! Mine’s hotter—think about it!”

“No thanks. I’m set on Old Du’s girl,” Guan Yu replied, suppressing a smirk.

As the men argued over whose daughter was superior, Guan Yu and Niu Le shared a weary glance.

Later, during their jade-gambling ventures, Guan Yu helped Du Xueheng quintuple his losses into profits. After splitting earnings, Guan Yu rushed home, eager to surprise Du Xiaojuan—only to find her absent, still playing “Child Queen.”

“Hey, I’m busy—call tomorrow!” she chirped before hanging up.

Suspicious but amused, Guan Yu dragged Niu Le to a nightclub where a brawl erupted with bouncers.

“Who dares cause trouble here?!” a thug roared—until recognizing Guan Yu.

“Boss Guan! My men were blind—forgive them!”

As the thugs retreated, Guan Yu recalled his humble origins and mysterious golden coin that sparked his fortune.

“Let’s celebrate!” he declared, Niu Le’s eyes lighting up at the prospect of women and revelry.

Under neon lights, they entered “Ripples” nightclub, its entrance lined with scantily clad hostesses. A snooty greeter tried turning them away—until Niu Le’s slap brought the manager running.

“Apologies, Boss Guan! These fools didn’t recognize you!”

The night unfolded with chaos, camaraderie, and the lingering question of Guan Yu’s destiny—a tapestry woven with wealth, power, and entangled hearts.
