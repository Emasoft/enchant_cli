“Everyone, I had to leave for personal matters these past few days, yet never imagined so much would transpire in my absence. The battle between righteousness and evil, life and death—your performances have deeply disappointed me. Now, Qingtian demands our Pope’s written acknowledgment. What are your thoughts?” Guan Yu sat at the center, his tone carrying newfound authority. Though none openly opposed him, their varied expressions spoke volumes. Silence itself affirmed his position.

“The favorable situation Brother Guan established has been ruined by our actions. We all bear responsibility. Since you’ve returned, we entrust the alliance’s affairs to your capable hands.” Zuo Qingyi was first to voice support, knowing her limitations. Backing Guan Yu served both her and her sect’s interests.

“Amitabha… Benefactor Guan’s wisdom exposed the traitor in our Mount Jiuhua ranks and saved this humble monk’s life. You are worthy of leading this alliance.” To everyone’s surprise, Fa Neng seconded the motion. Guan Yu nodded at the monk before turning to the Kunlun representatives.

“We implore Daoist Guan to save our Young Master. Kunlun will be eternally grateful.” Qingming bowed deeply, sincerity lacing his words. With Guan Yu’s return reversing their desperate straits, swallowing pride seemed a small price.

“You’ve saved me twice now. My life is yours to command.” Zhang Ziran, fully recovered, flashed a grin that made Guan Yu roll his eyes.

“Very well. Since you all place such faith in me, I’ll assume command. I vow not absolute fairness, but restraint in wielding this power. We must proceed with the hostage exchange Qingtian demands—three days hence at Suburban Park. While I’ve few concerns about the swap itself, certain precautions are necessary…” Guan Yu spread his hands placatingly, outlining his strategy.

“What’s your take on their demand to exchange you?” Guan Yu addressed Yin Qianji civilly. The informant’s tips had proven reliable, though Qingtian’s schemes and Yin Qianjun’s interference had still ensnared Zhang Ziran and Ye Qingfeng.

“Merely transactional. The Yin Clan won’t risk my loose tongue. What I could reveal, I have. Keeping me gains nothing. My return benefits all.” Yin Qianji weighed his words carefully.

“Agreed. Prepare yourself—we’ll maintain appearances. May our cooperation…” Guan Yu’s smile hinted at unspoken implications.

“…extend only to present needs.” Yin Qianji returned the smile without commitment. Today’s ally would be tomorrow’s enemy.

Guan Yu nodded. A formidable player, yes, but no true rival—too calculating for grand ambitions, destined to remain a mere pawn.

The three days were spent productively. Guan Yu revisited the sect’s mountain gate.

“Jin Gang, I require resources. The mortal realm is barren, and White Cloud Temple can’t spare much. What solutions have you?” With Jin Gang needing Guan Yu’s help to revive the Demon-Subduing Sect, their partnership allowed bluntness. At least his wives now counted as sect disciples—a first step toward revival.

“Sect heritage demands reciprocity. Want our resources? Exchange them with suitable offerings.” Jin Gang’s directness frustrated Guan Yu. What could a primordial sect possibly need from the modern world?

“Be specific. List items obtainable in the mortal realm. How fare Huo Wu and others? Have they established Foundations?”

“Their progress is excellent—all have built Foundations. This Golden Immortal’s domain holds secrets beyond your ken. The Martial Hall, Training Pavilion… Care to experience them?” Jin Gang’s sly expression betrayed his urgency. Reviving the sect required revealing more mysteries.

Guan Yu materialized in a dark void marked “Martial Hall.” The strange temporal distortion confirmed his suspicion. “Different timeflow here?”

“Tenfold dilation. Your year of training here equals a month outside.”

“Tenfold?!” Guan Yu’s nails bit his palms—this was no dream. “What’s required to sustain this?”

“Artifacts tied to the Demonic Sect or Five Elements’ essence. Now, review the array fundamentals I taught.” Jin Gang withdrew, having said enough.

“Transmit the Five Elements’ essence data to my consciousness. I’ll track them.” Guan Yu’s excitement surged. Tenfold time could fortify his weakest areas—foundation and heritage.

When Guan Yu reappeared three days later, an oppressive aura weighed on all present—mental and physical.

“Guan Yu, retract your gravity field before you terrify the novices.” Jin Gang chuckled through their mental link. A month of constant gravity training in compressed time left habits slow to fade.

“My apologies. Everyone ready? Move out. May tonight proceed smoothly.” Ignoring stares, Guan Yu led the march. Tonight, he’d break Qingtian’s fangs.

**Chapter 1185: Hostage Exchange (Part 3)**

Under the full moon at Suburban Park, the exchange unfolded cordially. Ye Qingfeng returned to Guan Yu’s side as Yin Qianji rejoined Qingtian’s ranks.

“Good luck…”

“Likewise…”

Their handshake erupted in golden and black energy collision, cratering the earth. Black qi flickered across Guan Yu’s face; Qingtian’s hand trembled upon withdrawal.

Both departed swiftly, assessments made. Qingtian recognized Guan Yu’s underestimated strength; Guan Yu acknowledged his rival’s formidable prowess. The true battle lay ahead.

Guan Yu soon faced Yin Qianjun and three Golden Core elders—predictable yet daunting. Their presence meant greater forces assaulted his base.

“The Yin Clan never loses. Your composure honors White Cloud Temple’s legacy, but we remain enemies. Stay two hours, and we’ll spare bloodshed.” Yin Qianjun’s drunken demeanor belied sharp intent.

“Empty pleasantries. Only battle resolves this. And those cameras?” Guan Yu shattered hidden devices with a flick. “Beneath cultivators.”

“Credit where due—your mortal-world experience serves you. Gentlemen?” Yin Qianjun signaled the elders.

Three synchronized footsteps pulsed pressure rivaling Qingtian’s.

“Blood Demon Triple Yin Formation! Mind their footwork—their miasma weakens even your defenses.” Jin Gang’s voice sharpened.

Amidst bloody haze, Guan Yu followed mental guidance: “Left three steps—Three Stars Alignment!” His violet blade pierced an elder’s chest.

“White Tiger Overturns Heaven—Right seven steps—Seven Stars Illuminate!” A spectral tiger dispersed crimson clouds as seven sword beams hammered the formation.

“Shaking Light Slash!” The killing stroke severed a throat, spraying blood. The surviving elders gaped as Yin Qianjun fled.

“Sword Intent of the Seven Stars…” Guan Yu mused over the guidance that saved him.

“No time for epiphanies. Reclaim that corpse—it’s worth two spirit stones or half a month’s training.” Jin Gang’s casual remark chilled Guan Yu—the guardian’s depths grew unfathomable.

Returning to base, Guan Yu observed golden light erupting—the埋伏伏魔阵 activated beyond expectations. He withheld approach, depositing Ye Qingfeng nearby.

“Awake. You retained awareness under their restraints. What say you?” Guan Yu’s cold tone demanded accountability.

Ye Qingfeng rose stiffly. “I accept responsibility. Underestimation was my error.” His calm suggested triviality.

Guan Yu’s gaze hardened. Consequences would determine if this noble’s poise masked repentance or arrogance.
