“Sister Xiaorong, you’ve killed two people in one go!” Qiqi stammered, her voice trembling as she stared at the corpses lying barely two meters away. The proximity of the bloodstained scene made her scalp prickle with primal dread.

Though her palms were slick with nervous sweat, Wang Xiaorong maintained relative composure. Having witnessed countless executions during her travels with the Left Envoy, she understood the brutal axiom taught by both the Demon Lord and his lieutenant: Mercy toward enemies is cruelty to oneself. Compared to the wide-eyed Qiqi, she appeared almost unnervingly calm.

“These scum deserved worse!” Wang Xiaorong declared, reloading her crossbow with a metallic click. The customized weapon Guan Yu had gifted her now held mercury-core bolts – dormant for years until today’s baptism of blood. “Today I’ll teach them the cost of besieging us!”

Her aim proved lethally precise. Two elite Qin Family warriors fell before unsheathing their blades, their martial prowess rendered meaningless against this unexpected arsenal. Guan Yu, witnessing this from across the battleground, felt tension ease from his shoulders. While Wang Xiaorong secured their flank, he whirled through the melee like a vengeful typhoon, his Soulreaper Blade painting crimson arcs through the air.

Qin soldiers recoiled in terror, their formation crumbling. Each sweep of Guan Yu’s blade felled another combatant, until finally the steward Ma bellowed retreat. Like startled cockroaches, the Qin forces scattered – first the steward fleeing headlong, then his men dissolving into the winding alleys.

Chapter 4889: Too Exaggerated

The clamorous street fell eerily silent. Guan Yu approached the women, his blade still dripping. “Are you unharmed?”

“We’re fine,” Wang Xiaorong replied, though anxiety tinged her voice. “But we must leave. This is the capital – killing here won’t go unnoticed.”

Guan Yu gestured at the two corpses. “Self-defense absolves us. But who were these men? Why target you?” His gaze swept the dispersing crowd, lingering where Magistrate Cao had stood earlier. The official’s abrupt disappearance after witnessing Qin’s humiliation spoke volumes.

As whispers of the Qin Family’s disastrous rout spread through the crowd, Guan Yu sheathed his blade. Today’s victory carried bitter aftertaste – several Qin elites slain, their reputation battered. Retribution would inevitably follow.

Chapter 4890: Endless Silver

In the Cao manor’s shadowed study, Magistrate Cao slumped in his rosewood chair, replaying the disastrous confrontation. His son Cao Di entered, face swathed in bandages from their last encounter with Guan Yu.

“Father? You seem troubled.” The words emerged slurred through medicinal dressings.

“Sit.” The magistrate’s fingers drummed the armrest. “This Wan Hong... his martial prowess defies expectation. Today I witnessed him decimate a hundred Qin soldiers single-handedly – their elites fell like wheat before his black blade.”

Cao Di’s bandages quivered with disbelief. “Impossible! That posturing cur got lucky with me! If properly prepared—”

“Enough!” The magistrate’s fist struck teak. “I saw blood-soaked reality, not tavern brawls. Even Qin’s forces retreated battered. We must reconsider our approach.”

A predatory gleam entered Cao Di’s eyes as his father outlined new prey – Jiang Xin, the Dragon Pearl, and legendary Eastern Sea treasures. Bandaged fingers twitched at the mention of the capital’s famed beauty. “So we snatch Jiang Xin to extort the pearl? Brilliant! But her guards...”

Magistrate Cao smiled like a spider eyeing trapped prey. “Patience. We’ll employ城外 allies. Once seized, we’ll stash her beyond the capital’s walls. Let the imperial guard tear apart empty streets – our prize will be safe in mountain strongholds.”

Chapter 4891: Forging Grand Schemes

Cao Di’s mind raced with dual visions – glittering treasures and Jiang Xin bound in silken ropes. “When do we strike?”

“All in due time.” The magistrate’s gaze turned distant, recounting tales of the Dragon Pearl’s bloody history – the peerless warrior Dai Xiaotian, his mermaid bride Qiao Meiren, and the demonic wars that swallowed entire sects. “Three decades lost, yet now it resurfaces... in Wan Hong’s possession, gifted to Jiang Xin at auction.”

The younger Cao licked cracked lips. “So we make Jiang Yuan exchange the pearl for his precious daughter. But the imperial repercussions...”

“Hence our城外 allies.” The magistrate’s smile turned glacial. “Let others take the risks. We’ll be ghosts in this drama – until the pearl is ours.”

As twilight painted the study in amber hues, father and son wove their conspiracy. Outside, unaware of the gathering storm, the capital continued its nightly revelries – merchants hawking wares, courtesans plucking pipas, and somewhere in the labyrinthine streets, a certain silver-eyed wanderer sharpened his blade, ready for the tempest to come.
