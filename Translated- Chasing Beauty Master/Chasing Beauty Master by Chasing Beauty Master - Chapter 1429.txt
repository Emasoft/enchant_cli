“Tall Guy wanted to take the fight outside, perhaps planning an escape—though it seemed unlikely the others would agree. Even if they did, fleeing wouldn’t be easy for him, not with his wife still inside. Even if he could run, she couldn’t.

‘A-Zu, let’s just apologize and end this,’ his wife pleaded. ‘Getting hurt isn’t worth it.’

Only then did Guan Yu learn the tall man’s name: A-Zu. The name sounded distinctive, matching his defiant demeanor. Clearly, this was someone who refused to back down. Having his wife spat on during her meal? He wouldn’t let that slide.

‘No,’ A-Zu retorted, patting his wife’s shoulder. ‘We’re the ones being bullied here. They’re using their numbers to provoke us. I won’t stand for it. Stay back and watch—I’ll be fine.’

His wife’s face remained etched with worry. Though she knew her husband’s capabilities, the odds were against him. Yet arguing was futile—A-Zu’s stubbornness was legendary. Once his mind was set, no words could sway him.

Unibrow grew impatient, shouting, ‘Boss! Quit dawdling! If the guards arrive, we’ll lose our chance! Hurry up and kill this prick!’

A-Zu waved dismissively. ‘You’ve already smashed half the furniture and driven off the customers. Settle this grudge outside—don’t ruin their business.’

‘Screw your grandma!’ Unibrow spat. ‘Since when do scum like you care about decency? I’ll smash whatever I want—I’ve got the silver to pay for it!’

Fat Boss hesitated. Normally, the trio’s strengths were evenly matched, but Second Brother had been kicked back effortlessly. Charging alone would be futile—he needed Third Brother’s support.

But Third Brother, ever sluggish, moved like molasses. Even a trip to the privy took him an hour. Now, he showed no urgency.

‘Third Brother, flank him from behind,’ Fat Boss ordered. ‘We’ll attack front and rear.’ He knew coordination wasn’t their strength—despite Third Brother’s skill, their teamwork was nonexistent. Numbers alone meant little; without synergy, they risked harming themselves.

Guan Yu chuckled, nudging Wang Xiaorong. ‘That lanky one looks half-asleep. Doesn’t seem eager to fight.’

‘True,’ Wang Xiaorong agreed. ‘But each of these four has their quirks.’

Trapped against the wall, A-Zu faced two attackers. Fat Boss raised his golden blade, its edge shimmering with golden inner qi. Despite his bulk, he leaped with surprising agility, descending like a boar in mid-air, blade slashing downward!

**Chapter 3718: Arrest All the Troublemakers**

Guan Yu noted the golden qi swirling around Fat Boss’s blade. ‘These aren’t amateurs. He’s stronger than Unibrow.’ Yet with his own minimal inner qi, Guan Yu couldn’t gauge their cultivation levels—a frustrating limitation.

As Fat Boss’s strike descended, Lanky Third Brother attacked from the left. Ignoring the broadsword at his waist, he whipped out a long leather lash. It cracked against the floor before arcing toward A-Zu’s legs.

Cornered, A-Zu couldn’t retreat. His wife stood too close to the left, and a overturned table blocked the right. With no options, he ducked beneath the table.

The brothers scoffed. ‘Hiding like a dog?’

But A-Zu, despite his size, moved with fluid grace. Injured arm or not, his agility outmatched either foe alone. Slipping out the table’s far end, he lunged with a kick.

Fat Boss dodged, countering with a golden swipe. A-Zu, unable to block barehanded, retreated.

Chaotic footsteps erupted outside as soldiers stormed in. A constable in leather armor strode forward, chest puffed. ‘Who dares cause trouble here?’

The innkeeper scurried over. ‘Constable Han! These ruffians wrecked my property and scared off customers! Arrest them—they’re clearly criminals!’

‘Sound reasoning,’ Constable Han nodded, not bothering to investigate. Their collusion was obvious.

Soldiers encircled the crowd. Fat Boss brandished his blade. ‘So what if we broke some junk? We’ll pay for it!’

‘Fool!’ Constable Han snapped. ‘Disrupting business isn’t solved by coin! You’ll answer for this!’

‘How much could this dump earn?’ Fat Boss tossed a gold ingot. The innkeeper fumbled it, scrambling to retrieve it like a starved rat.

‘Ten times this!’ the innkeeper demanded, eyes gleaming.

‘Tenfold?!’ Fat Boss and Unibrow roared. ‘Just rob us!’

The innkeeper smirked inwardly. These fools carried fat purses—he’d drain them dry.

Constable Han cut in, feigning professionalism. ‘Why’d this start?’

A waiter stepped forward. ‘These two guests took a dirty table. That boy claimed it was his, spat on the woman, and the fight began.’

Constable Han eyed Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong. ‘So you’re the instigators?’

Guan Yu frowned. ‘We’re bystanders. That boy caused it.’

‘Lies!’ The boy sneered. ‘I’ll do as I please!’

‘We’re leaving,’ Guan Yu said coldly.

‘Leaving?’ Constable Han smirked. ‘Arrest everyone!’

Chaos erupted. Fat Boss and Third Brother knocked soldiers aside until one pinned the boy, blade to his throat. ‘Surrender or he dies!’

‘Save me!’ the boy wailed.

As Fat Boss hesitated, soldiers subdued Unibrow. ‘My back! Have mercy!’

**Chapter 3719: We’re Law-Abiding Citizens**

Constable Han barked, ‘Resist again, and the brat loses his head!’

Soldiers approached Guan Yu. He kicked one back, sparking a brawl. Fat Boss and Third Brother felled several guards, but Constable Han threatened archers outside.

‘Fight on, and you’ll be pin cushions!’

A soldier yelped theatrically after Third Brother’s light kick. ‘Assaulting an officer? You’re finished!’

‘Arrest them all!’ Constable Han ordered.

As soldiers grabbed Wang Xiaorong, Guan Yu tensed. This petty official’s greed and lust wouldn’t end well.

**Chapter 3720: Enough Talk**

The boy’s cries decided it. Fat Boss dropped his blade. ‘Don’t hurt him!’

Guards swarmed, binding the trio. Constable Han leered at Wang Xiaorong. ‘You’re coming too, “law-abiding citizens.”’

Guan Yu’s fist clenched. This farce would escalate—but for now, patience ruled.
