“There’s no other way,” Wang Xiaorong sighed, resorting to magic to clear the dust around them. Only then could the two see what lay ahead.

The stone door’s interior was not pitch black as they had imagined. Even from outside, a faint glow was visible—perhaps from countless luminous gemstones within.

“Hurry! Let’s go in and look!” Wang Xiaorong urged impatiently.

“Be careful—there might be dangers,” Guan Yu cautioned. “Stay behind me. Once inside, don’t touch anything, understand?”

Wang Xiaorong nodded vigorously. As they stepped through the doorway, the Blazing Heaven Furnace hanging on the door suddenly flew down as if alive, landing squarely in her hands.

Guan Yu stared in surprise. “Why are you taking my artifact?”

“I didn’t take it! It flew to me on its own!” Wang Xiaorong replied gleefully. “Maybe it’s fate? Why else would it choose me?”

Guan Yu pondered but found no answer. Wang Xiaorong, unwilling to keep his treasure, handed the furnace back.

“Since the Blazing Heaven Furnace hasn’t been bound to a master,” Guan Yu mused, “perhaps it sensed your demonic cultivation aura and gravitated toward you.”

As the furnace descended, the stone door rumbled shut behind them. Guan Yu worried briefly about their escape but trusted the furnace would guide them out.

“Wow, this place is enormous!” Wang Xiaorong marveled at the resplendent golden corridor.

Even Guan Yu was awed. The Thousand-Year Ancestor Meng Hua had clearly amassed unimaginable wealth. The entire passage—walls, ceiling, even the floor—glittered with luminous gemstones.

Wang Xiaorong nearly dashed forward, but Guan Yu held her back. The pristine preservation of this ancient place felt unnaturally perfect.

“Let’s use flight spells to move. The floor might have traps,” he suggested, only to despair moments later—their spiritual energy was sealed here, suppressed by some force.

Wang Xiaorong frowned. Though spiritual energy was blocked, inner energy still flowed. Perhaps Ancestor Meng Hua’s tomb deliberately restricted immortal techniques.

“Hold onto me and step exactly where I do,” Guan Yu instructed.

Nodding, Wang Xiaorong followed closely. They navigated a winding corridor, its gem-studded splendor hinting at unimaginable riches. A single handful could make one staggeringly wealthy.

The pair entered a vast chamber adorned with furnishings. A triangular symbol identical to the stone door’s carving dominated the far wall. Below it lay a large tatami mat, before which sat a skeletal figure clad in miraculously preserved robes.

**Chapter 3553: Welcome**

The skeleton sat in meditation, a blood-red luminous orb resting on its right palm. Pillars of gold supported the chamber, their brilliance accentuating the tomb’s opulence.

Wang Xiaorong pointed at wall murals. “Look! The triangle matches the door—it’s Black Blood Ridge’s totem. And that square on the left…”

Guan Yu examined the intricate square symbol. “That’s the Demon Soul Diagram,” she explained. “Our Demon Soul Sect’s emblem. My father said cultivating near it enhances progress. The circular pattern with beasts belongs to the Blood Hunt Sect, and the flower represents the Monstrous Demon Cave.”

“So the Demon Sect fragmented even during Ancestor Meng Hua’s reign?” Guan Yu asked.

“No,” Wang Xiaorong corrected. “These represent his Four Blood Demon Guardians. The split happened after his death, when their ambitions clashed.”

Guan Yu nodded. “So the Four Blood Demons caused the schism, each taking their symbols to forge new sects.”

As they spoke, Guan Yu’s attention returned to the skeleton. “This must be Ancestor Meng Hua. But why no signs of battle? Legends say his enemies cornered him here.”

“That’s puzzling,” Wang Xiaorong agreed. “Yet everything remains intact.”

Guan Yu gestured to the red orb. “Could that be the first volume of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique? Where else would it be hidden?”

“Possibly! Let’s take it!”

“Wait!” Guan Yu warned. “The energy here is unstable. We must be cautious.”

Ignoring caution, Guan Yu channeled inner energy. In a blur of motion, he vaulted across pillars to the skeleton’s side.

“Ancestor, forgive this intrusion,” he murmured respectfully before seizing the orb.

The moment the orb touched his hand, it dissolved into smoke that surged up his arm into his mind. A violent collision erupted between the invading force and a seal in his consciousness. Agony dropped him to the floor, writhing as forgotten memories flooded back alongside torrents of unfamiliar incantations.

Wang Xiaorong rushed to him, sobbing. “Guan Yu! Are you alright?!”

Minutes later, the pain subsided. Drenched in sweat, Guan Yu lay exhausted as the tomb began quaking. Gems dimmed; splendor crumbled to dust. The skeleton reconstituted into a youthful figure—Ancestor Meng Hua himself, smiling.

“Welcome, fated ones.”

**Chapter 3554: Unanswered**

“You… you’re Ancestor Meng Hua?” Wang Xiaorong stammered.

“Indeed. Time is short. Young man, you’ve obtained the Eight-Sided Drum’s first volume. To master it, you must gather all four scrolls.”

Guan Yu knelt respectfully. “Thank you, Ancestor.”

The ancestor studied him. “A rare dual cultivator! Worthy of my legacy. Seek the second volume—we’ll meet again there.”

With those words, his form dissipated. The skeleton turned to ash, leaving only a cloth fragment floating down.

Guan Yu caught it, finding ancient symbols inscribed. “This must lead to the second volume,” Wang Xiaorong deduced.

As they pondered, the tomb shook violently. “Run!” Guan Yu shouted, dragging her out as the structure collapsed.

**Chapter 3555: Retreat**

Emerging at the lakeshore, they found their companions—Demon Soul Sect disciples, Monstrous Demon Cave members, and allies—alive but tense.

“You’re safe!” Guan Yu’s friend Xiao Zhi exclaimed. “We were swept back here after the lake swallowed us!”

Wang Xiaorong announced, “The Eight-Sided Drum is already Guan Yu’s. Let’s leave—this place isn’t safe.”

Nearby, the Monstrous Demon Cave’s Xiliu stared despondently at the water. Her sister Xitaohua had not returned.

As factions weighed confrontation, Guan Yu clutched the cryptic cloth. Though clueless about its meaning, he resolved to unravel its secrets—wherever the next trial awaited.
