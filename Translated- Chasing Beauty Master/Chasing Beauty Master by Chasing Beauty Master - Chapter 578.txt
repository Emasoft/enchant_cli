Guan Yu was slightly taken aback as he glanced at the bidder - a middle-aged man in his fifties, a wealthy merchant from Tianming City.

“Hey, Mu Luosu,” someone called out mockingly, “Didn’t your son already break through? Why are you still bidding on this trinket?”

Provoked, Mu Luosu retorted angrily, “What’s it to you? I’m buying it for my future grandson. Got a problem with that?”

The crowd erupted in laughter. After several more bids, Mu Luosu finally secured the item for three thousand gold coins.

Next, Miss Sally turned and produced an ancient tome. “This is a high-grade Mysterious Tier cultivation manual—our finale for today. Prepare yourselves, everyone!”

At these words, Guan Yu’s heart stirred. His gaze fixed on the manual as he thought, “My recent cultivation has hit a bottleneck. If I can obtain this manual, all my problems will be solved!”

Just then, a voice chimed in beside him, “It’s just a Mysterious Tier manual. Nothing extraordinary.”

Guan Yu turned to see none other than his magical pet, Bicat.

“Shut it, you mangy cat,” Guan Yu hissed. “One more word and I’ll roast you for dinner!”

On stage, Miss Sally announced, “This scroll was entrusted to us by a friend. You may bid with confidence!”

“Just name the price already! We’re losing patience!”

“Very well,” she replied with a smile. “Since you’re all eager, let me unveil it properly.” As she unrolled the Mysterious Tier scroll, a blinding golden light erupted, dazzling every pair of eyes in the hall.

“What’s the starting bid?”

“Fifty thousand gold coins!”

Gasps filled the air. Fifty thousand! The crowd stared in stunned silence. “You might as well just rob us!” someone muttered.

Amid the tension, a voice called out, “Too expensive! Can’t you lower the price?”

All eyes turned to see He Lifu, a wealthy merchant from Wusucheng.

“Oh? If it isn’t Master He Lifu!” Miss Sally teased. “Since when does a man of your means pinch coins? Didn’t your ventures in Tianming City turn massive profits this year? Or are you just being stingy?”

He Lifu ignored her jabs. Before wealth, even a beauty’s charms paled.

Unlike the earlier elixir, this high-tier scroll exerted a magnetic pull. Such rare artifacts drove men to madness. As the crowd recovered from shock, a bidding war erupted.

Guan Yu observed coldly. “Who knows if this manual’s effects match the legends? Might all be hype to inflate prices.” His gaze shifted to Sally. The woman was formidable. She lifted the golden scroll and declared, “No more delays. Let the bidding commence!”

Silence fell. Fifty thousand gold was no trifling sum, and none wished to be first. Yet Mysterious Tier scrolls were rarer than phoenix feathers across the continent.

“Eighty thousand!” A white-haired elder shouted.

Before admiration could settle, another voice rang out: “One hundred thousand!”

The crowd gaped. The bidder was a bald merchant from Tianming City. To everyone’s surprise, after securing the scroll, Guan Yu suddenly withdrew. “You win. I yield.”

The bald man flushed with rage. “You bastard! You played me!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Don’t blame me. You wanted it.” He turned and left.

Upon reentering the hall, a sultry voice stopped him: “Young Master Guan Yu?”

He turned to see a voluptuous woman by the entrance, her bewitching smile dripping with allure.

“My elixirs are sold. Pay me,” Guan Yu stated flatly.

“Why rush?” she purred. “Since you’re here, let’s become acquainted. Your full name?”

Guan Yu’s brow twitched. “What? Does selling pills here require leaving records?”

Noticing his irritation, Sally quickly smiled. “Of course not. I merely wish to gift you something.” She handed him a blue card. “Our auction house’s VIP pass. Bypass guards and enter private chambers directly next time.”

Guan Yu’s mood lifted slightly. He pocketed the card without ceremony.

As Sally’s smile deepened, Guan Yu felt an unwelcome stir. “This vixen’s charms could tempt a saint. If she set her sights on me, I’d be defenseless.”

To safeguard his cultivation focus, Guan Yu bid farewell and hurried home.

Back at the Mixed Heavens Sect, he retreated to his chamber with newly acquired medicinal ingredients, ready for secluded training.

A knock interrupted. “Young Master Guan Yu? Are you in?”

Opening the door, he found Sect Master Huo Zhentian himself.

“Sect Master! To what do I owe this visit?”

The elder chuckled. “I’ve neglected you since your arrival. Consider this an overdue welcome.”

“You honor me. I already feel at home here. For any needs, simply instruct Murphy.”

Huo Zhentian laughed heartily. “Excellent! Rest well for now. Once recovered, we’ll speak again.”

As the Sect Master left, Guan Yu felt warmth. This was the second benefactor he’d met—the first being Allen, patriarch of the Elf Clan. Both treated him with fatherly kindness.

A sudden energy ripple at his window snapped Guan Yu to alertness. Peering out, he spotted a small figure with pink ribboned pigtails crouching below.

“Little spy, what are you up to?”

The girl jumped, cheeks flushing crimson. “Mean Brother Guan Yu! Scaring me like that!”

This was Huo Lingling—the Sect Master’s mischievous daughter. Though aloof with others, she clung to Guan Yu like glue.

“Where did you go today?” she demanded, spotting his herbs. “Oh! You went herb-shopping without me!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “It’s not playtime. What use is a child tagging along?”

“But...I just want to be with you!” Her lips quivered. “You always sneak off! Meanie!”

“Alright, next time I’ll bring you. Now off to bed—it’s late.”

After ushering the pouting girl away, Guan Yu laid out his herbs. Since arriving in the Proud Moon Empire, his cultivation had stagnated. Though capable against local warriors, he remained far from true mastery—a shadow of his former self.

He’d spent months refining his signature technique: Condensing Qi into Blades. Stuck at the fifth stage for half a year, his desperation grew.

Glancing at the moonlit window after hours of practice, he muttered, “Third watch already.”

A grim resolve hardened his heart. “Break through to the sixth stage within two days, or consider myself ruined.”

As azure energy swirled into his body, even the water cup beside him tinged blue. The air thickened, reality itself bending around his focused aura—a spectacle that would stun observers.

“Need help, boss?” Bicat’s voice interrupted.

Though Guan Yu’s power had waned, his magical companion retained full strength. According to Bicat, allies Amy and Liu Chuntian remained captive by the Warwolf Mercenaries. Leaders Wolf Tianhun and Wolf Tianba—both peak Magus Masters—threatened their lives. Worse, Wolf Tianba neared breakthrough to Forbidden Curse Mage status.

To rescue his friends and protect the Elven Forest’s Life Spring—coveted for its soul-enhancing properties—Guan Yu needed urgent growth. Currently a Fifth-stage Magus, he faced an ocean’s gap between himself and his enemies.

“Amy, wait for me,” he vowed. “I swear I’ll return within three months!”

“Boss, you’re exhausted,” Bicat pressed. “Rest first.”

“Mind your own fur.” Focusing, Guan Yu extended a trembling hand. A book levitated shakily from his desk.

“Wow! Your strength’s returning!”

Guan Yu glared. “Mocking me? I used to move mountains. Now a book’s an achievement?”

“Stay hopeful! You’ll improve fast!”

Before Guan Yu could retort, silver bells of laughter echoed outside. “Brother Guan Yu? Are you there?”

Confused—she’d just left—he opened the curtain. Dawn’s glare stabbed his eyes. He’d pondered all night.

“You’re dressed already?” Huo Lingling blinked. “So early today?”

Guan Yu yawned. “Why the dawn intrusion?”

“Silly! It’s Annual Testing Day! Passers get to pick manuals from the Scripture Pavilion!”

Guan Yu froze. “Testing? For what?”

“Qualifiers choose cultivation scrolls! And you can join—because you’re my friend!” Though an outsider, Huo Lingling’s influence granted him access.

“Hurry and prepare! We must reach the grounds by noon!”

As Guan Yu complied, another thought struck—this might be his chance to barter for a spatial teleportation scroll. The key to crossing seas and rescuing Amy...
