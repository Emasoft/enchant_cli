Fortunately, there were no betting limits here. As long as one had silver, they could wager freely, and the dealers accepted all stakes. Even if someone brought a golden mountain, the house would take it - though in such cases, they'd simply seize the entire fortune without compunction. Not giving you triples would be considered generous treatment already.

The dealer appraised Guanyu with narrowed eyes. Though this young master clearly came from wealth, squandering money so recklessly suggested more affluence than sense. The female dealer who should have come to warn him about this problematic, martial-skilled youth remained conspicuously silent. She stood at a distance watching like a spectator, piquing Guanyu's curiosity.

Unbeknownst to Guanyu, each dealer here operated independently - mere casino employees who'd passed skill assessments. Their earnings depended entirely on the house's daily profits through commission shares. Having lost badly today, the female dealer faced potential dismissal. With her rice bowl at risk, why would she care about others' troubles?

Driven by begrudging others' misfortune, she decided to let this new dealer taste bitterness too - at least that would balance her wounded pride. She remained passive, knowing informants had already been dispatched. This young master's bluster wouldn't last.

"What cursed luck today, meeting this jinx," the female dealer grumbled, hands on hips.

The rivers and lakes teemed with extraordinary talents. Any true master could easily fleece this small-time casino, but such experts rarely lacked funds. Similarly, noble young masters disdained these vulgar dens, preferring elegant venues for their gambling.

The female dealer puzzled over why this resplendently dressed youth chose to cause trouble here today. As Guanyu slammed his palm on the table, channeling internal energy to manipulate the dice, she watched without intervention.

When the dice revealed "Big" against all odds, both dealers froze in disbelief. "Hahaha! Heaven smiles on me today!" cackled a toothless old man who'd followed Guanyu's bets. "Stick with me and we'll bleed these dealers dry!" Guanyu declared.

The dealer's face soured. His planned windfall evaporated when that eight hundred tael bet hit. "Damned ghosts at work," he cursed inwardly. Next round, he'd unleash triples to recoup losses.

The bookkeeper beside him shot a derisive look - how could he let such massive payouts happen? Skillful dealers knew to win subtly, avoiding suspicion. But now the crowd followed Guanyu's every move.

"Big again! Everyone follow my lead!" Guanyu shouted, slamming sixteen hundred tael notes on the table. The staggering wager turned eyes bloodshot. Soon, the entire three-meter table's "Big" side piled high with silver, gold, and notes while "Small" lay barren.

Sweat beaded on the dealer's brow as Guanyu grinned. When the bookkeeper nudged him, they exchanged meaningful glances. "What excitement!" the dealer forced laughter, shaking the dice cup theatrically. Guanyu spotted the switch - two magnetic dice that always landed on one pip.

"Wait!" Guanyu halted the reveal. "The dealer shook twice. I'm changing to Small!" He moved his stake, sparking a frenzied migration of bets.

"You can't change after settling!" the dealer protested weakly.

"Open it then! Hesitating means cheating!" the crowd roared. Trapped, the dealer lifted the cup to show 1-1-5. Pandemonium erupted as winners clamored for payouts.

Guanyu seized the fleeing dealer's neck. "Put those dice back!" he growled. After collecting his 3,200 taels, he exposed the magnetic trickery. "See? These dice always land on one! The house cheats you all!"

Enraged gamblers pummeled the dealer. "Compensate our losses!" Guanyu incited. As chaos consumed the casino - smashing, looting, brawling - Guanyu slipped away with his spoils.

His next target stood nearby: Xianlaike Restaurant, another Cao Family property seized through foul means. The bustling establishment catered to Kyoto's elite. "Serve your finest dishes," Guanyu ordered, slapping down silver notes.

Meanwhile at Cao Manor, a messenger reported: "The casino's destroyed! Cheating exposed!"

"Who dares?!" bellowed Patriarch Cao, shears trembling in his garden. "Arrest every rioter!"

"Already informed the magistrates, but the mob demands compensation..."

"Throw the dealer to the wolves then!" Cao snapped, oblivious to Guanyu's orchestration. The storm had only begun.
