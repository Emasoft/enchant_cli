“Among the people here, aside from Hou Jinshun (Golden Obedience) who could still exchange a few moves with Li Zhiming (Wise Brightness), the others were no match. But now with Guanyu’s appearance, the situation had become complicated. If a fight broke out, Guanyu alone would already be more than Li could handle, let alone with Hou Jinshun whose cultivation was comparable to his own.”

“Well, well! If it isn’t Guanyu. Never thought you’d be lounging around here too.” Li Zhiming’s tone was noticeably less arrogant when speaking to Guanyu.

“Necessity drives me. The city only has two major bars—Mike’s and Huaye (Night Blossom). But Mike’s sells nothing but counterfeit liquor. No choice but to drink here.” Guanyu chuckled.

Li Zhiming’s facial muscles twitched. Today was cursed luck. Forcing a smile, he said, “Hahaha, Guanyu, you’ve always had a sharp wit. Out of respect for you, let’s consider today’s matter settled.”

After Li Zhiming turned to leave, the police officers present sighed in relief. Had a real fight erupted, these low-ranking officers wouldn’t have known what to do.

Hou Jinshun suddenly shouted, “Stop! You smashed my glass and think you can just walk away?”

**Chapter 1991: Attacking Everyone in Sight**

Li Zhiming’s face twitched again. Suppressing his fury, he forced a grin. “Hahaha, Guanyu, enough jokes. For your sake, let’s drop this today.”

As Li departed, the tension among the police dissolved. Confrontation avoided.

Hou Jinshun barked, “Halt! You break my property and leave without consequence?”

Li Zhiming, already swallowing his pride, spun around, eyes darkening at Hou’s provocation.

Guanyu understood men like Li: they only fear those stronger. Hou was right—damages were owed. Stepping forward, Guanyu said, “Big Boss Li, surely Mike’s Bar can afford to replace a pane of glass?”

Li’s jaw clenched, but facing Guanyu’s superiority and Hou’s formidable presence, he restrained himself.

“Of course. Damages must be paid.” Li pulled a wallet from his coat, extracting a stack of cash—nearly ten thousand yuan. “This should cover a new door. Make it sturdier next time.” He flung the money onto a table and left.

After Li’s exit, Hou muttered, “What ill wind brought Li Zhiming here to stir trouble today?”

“Mike’s crew never visits Huaye. His younger brother’s earlier disturbance was clearly orchestrated,” Guanyu remarked.

Yang Conghan (Frost Willow) remained silent, sensing deeper schemes. She resolved to consult the Yang family.

Later, Yang asked Hou, “Manager Hou, any news on Jinhua (Golden Flower)?”

Guanyu’s ears perked. If Hou informed Yang first about Jinhua’s whereabouts, complications would follow.

Hou shook his head. “Nothing yet, Miss Yang. Rest assured, you’ll be notified immediately.”

Yang nodded, bid farewell, and left. Guanyu pulled Hou aside. “Old Hou, notify *me* first about Jinhua. Keep it from Conghan. I’ll bear any consequences.”

Hou agreed. To him, Guanyu was a mentor; the Yangs mere employers.

Assured by Hou’s nod, Guanyu departed, anxious to find Jinhua. Her knowledge might unravel the seal in Zhang Han’s mind—and his own.

“Brother Guan, heard you almost got arrested! Was it Sun Xu’s doing?” Wei Hongwei’s call came through.

Guanyu scoffed. “You’re quick with gossip but slow with real intel. I question your competence.”

Wei’s mockery was evident. He and Jia Bo now ruled Kaihuang Academy, boredom leading to taunts.

“I’m loyal, Brother Guan! Never slacked!” Wei protested.

“Prove it. Any news on Sun Xu’s condition?”

“Still unconscious. Sun Heizi hired private guards and doctors.”

“Even if he wakes, recovery’ll take months. What of the school?”

“New principal arrives tomorrow—a beauty, they say.” Wei leered.

“I’ll see this ‘beauty’ tomorrow.”

Hanging up, Guanyu resolved to strike Sun Heizi first. Waiting for retaliation was folly.

That night, Guanyu slipped from Amei’s embrace, donned black attire, and vaulted the villa wall.

Outside, eight黑衣 men awaited—handpicked from Jones’s organization. Their mission: raid the Sun residence, attack所有人, destroy一切.

Sun Heizi’s雇佣 supernatural beings posed risks, hence the backup. Ten figures, masked, sped toward the Sun compound in an unmarked van.

Approaching the brightly lit estate, Guanyu noted surveillance cameras and infrared sensors. “A damned fortress,” he muttered.

Assigning three to disable security, chaos erupted as patrols spotted them. Guanyu’s team swarmed, incapacitating guards with灭火器 foam.

Breaching the walls, they unleashed havoc—spraying rooms, smashing furnishings. Guards collapsed, blinded by chemical spray.

Amidst the wreckage, Guanyu noted Sun Heizi’s absence. As police sirens neared, he ordered retreat.

One man, Jia Er, attempted assaulting a bound maid. Guanyu’s shout halted him. “Retreat! Now!”

Disgruntled, Jia Er fled, joining the van’s escape.

Back at headquarters, Guanyu chastised Jia Er for endangering the mission but spared him organizational discipline—earning loyalty.

**Chapter 1992: Favors Owed**

Guanyu’s mercy secured his men’s gratitude. Meanwhile, police found Sun’s estate in ruins—walls scrawled with灭火器 residue, maid traumatized.

Sun Heizi emerged, livid. “Guanyu! I’ll rend you limb from limb!”

No evidence tied Guanyu, yet the message was clear. Cameras showed only masked figures—identical shoes confounding footprint analysis.

Guanyu returned to Amei’s side, dawn approaching. Today, the new principal awaited.

**Chapter 1993: The New Principal**

At Kaihuang Academy, rumors swirled. Guanyu entered, curious about the fabled beauty set to command the school’s chaos.
