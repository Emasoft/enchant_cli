“Tsk, Guan Yu, you’re truly cunning. You’re clearly a martial cultivator, yet you still dare to fight me. I see you’re guilty of wrongdoing and deliberately trying to provoke me into attacking you, aren’t you?” Wen Ming’s words were infuriating.

Guan Yu sneered. “I’ve met shameless people before, but never one as thick-skinned as you. Fine! Since you claim I’m bullying you, I won’t use martial techniques against you. How about that? If you’ve got the guts, come at me. If I resort to martial arts, I’ll be the bastard here.”

Upon hearing this, Wen Ming secretly rejoiced, thinking he could finally defeat Guan Yu and restore Left Void Peak’s honor. Yet Guan Yu’s composure made him wary of a trap. “You truly won’t use martial arts? Don’t cry foul later about me bullying you.”

“Relax. When I say I won’t, I won’t. All our fellow disciples are watching. You might not care about shame, but I value my dignity. I swear not to use an ounce of martial energy. Come forth.”

Guan Yu showed no courtesy—such people only took kindness as weakness. He had no intention of holding back. With a flourish, he summoned the Imperial Seal and Soulfall Blade.

“Senior Brother Wen Ming, I keep my promises. Today, I’ll face you with magic alone.” A wicked smile played on Guan Yu’s lips as he channeled spiritual energy into his artifacts.

The Imperial Seal glowed in his left hand, the Soulfall Blade shimmered in his right—both radiating an aura of majesty that demanded reverence. The crowd murmured in awe; most disciples had never seen such exalted artifacts. Though none had witnessed the Imperial Seal before, its jade-like form distinguished it from the blade-shaped Soulfall Blade.

Wen Ming’s face paled. He recalled Elder Xuan Ming’s recent warnings: Guan Yu wielded supreme artifacts imbued with formidable spells by Grandmaster Jiu. The artifacts’ faint luminescence irrefutably marked Guan Yu as a dual cultivator of martial and mystical arts—an unprecedented feat in Cloud Azure Sect.

Xiao Zhi nearly laughed aloud. Now he understood why Elder Xuan Ming and Elder Lu had vied to recruit Guan Yu, showering him with treasures. This wasn’t about imagined nepotism but recognizing a once-in-a-generation talent.

“A dual cultivator…” Wen Ming muttered, dread hollowing his voice. The crowd stared at Guan Yu with mingled fear and awe. Even if every disciple here attacked together, the Imperial Seal’s stored spells could flatten half of Tiger Head Peak.

Guan Yu coldly pressed, “Wen Ming, I’ll ask once more: are you certain about this duel?” Though his spiritual reserves were meager, he’d mastered channeling them after Elder Xuan Ming’s guidance. This display was pure theater—a warning shot to all challengers.

He raised the Imperial Seal. “This artifact, gifted by my master, stores four supreme spells from Grandmaster Jiu himself. Any one could reduce you to ash.” The crowd buzzed louder. Grandmaster Jiu’s involvement elevated Guan Yu’s status beyond dispute.

Meanwhile, A’cai—bandaged and seething—shouted hoarsely from the ground, “Wen Ming! What are you waiting for? Avenge me!” The spectators eyed him pityingly; demanding combat now was suicidal.

Xiao Zhi jeered, “Look at him—too scared to lift a finger!” Guan Yu added mockingly, “If you’re so eager, A’cai, fight me yourself.” The battered disciple fell silent, his envy of Guan Yu’s artifacts burning brighter than his injuries.

As tensions peaked, Guan Yu turned to leave. “Let’s go. Nothing worthwhile remains here.” But A’ze reminded him to check tomorrow’s match listing. Passing the Gathering Peak disciples, Guan Yu locked eyes with Siqi—their prior encounter in the latrine flashed between them. Her companions Xiao Tong, Xiao Chun, and Xiao Lian glared, still resentful over Shi Zhen’s fate.

Shi Zhen—the fifth disciple Gathering Peak’s Elder Dai had excluded—lay bedridden, her jaw shattered and spine damaged by Guan Yu’s reflexive kick. Though Elder Dai had hushed the scandal, everyone knew: one misstep in recovery, and Shi Zhen would remain a vegetable forever.

At the assembly hall days prior, Elder Dai had coolly justified Shi Zhen’s absence as a “training accident,” praising her remaining disciples’ prowess. Her veiled jab at other peaks’ “quantity over quality” still rankled, especially Left Void Peak’s Elder Xiang, who’d brought twenty disciples.

Yet now, none of that mattered. Guan Yu’s dual cultivation and divine artifacts overshadowed all politics. As he strode past the murmuring crowd, Xiao Zhi and A’ze followed like heralds before a conquering king.
