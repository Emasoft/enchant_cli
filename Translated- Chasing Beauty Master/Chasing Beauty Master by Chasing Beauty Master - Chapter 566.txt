“Lang Tianhun, that’s a fine name. It seems all ten brothers of the War Wolf pack share the ‘Lang Tian’ series. But I must say yours is my favorite.”

“Heh, should this old man thank you for that, young brother Guan Yu? I heard you once clashed with my seventh brother?” Lang Tianhun’s gaze shifted toward Lang Tianhua standing nearby.

Guan Yu immediately guessed whom he meant and nodded. “Indeed, we fought once. Though the outcome remains undecided.”

“Oh? Few can hold their own against Seventh Brother. Your skill is remarkable for one so young. Might I inquire who your master is?”

Guan Yu realized this was a probe into his origins. Given his otherworldly background, any answers would only deepen their confusion. “My master? I doubt you’d know him even if I told you.”

This provoked Lang Tianming, who stormed forward, jabbing a finger at Guan Yu. “You brat! Can’t you speak properly? Do you think Second Brother is some ignorant fool?”

“Ahem,” Guan Yu replied coolly, “I once respected your strength, puzzled why you ranked tenth among the War Wolves. Now I see the logic. Your cultivation pales beside Second Brother Lang Tianhun—even Lang Tianhua surpasses you.”

The retort left Lang Tianming speechless. How could he deny being weaker than both his second and seventh brothers?

**Chapter 1433: The Divine Beast, Dragon Cat**

“Young Brother Guan Yu,” Lang Tianhun interjected, “will you reconsider my tenth brother’s earlier proposal?”

“No. I dislike being shackled,” Guan Yu answered without hesitation.

The refusal drew an awkward chuckle from Lang Tianhun. “Youth cherishes freedom—I understand, having been young myself. Yet arrogance often blinds fledglings to danger. Tigers feast on fearless calves who mistake boldness for strength.”

“Thank you for the counsel. I’ll tread carefully.”

Noting Guan Yu’s subdued tone, Lang Tianhun pressed, “You’re clearly not from Barren Town. These wretches lack your bearing and power. Why champion their cause?”

“Should I side with you instead? What crime have they committed to warrant slaughter for your ambitions? Where is the justice?”

“Justice?” Lang Tianhun snorted. “In thirty years roaming Lánměi Continent, I’ve seen no ‘absolute justice.’ Survival favors the strong—this is nature’s law. Your question betrays naivety.”

“You fixate on my youth, yet cultivation transcends age. Men like you may never grasp this truth.”

“Boss! What’s happening?”

A whirlwind of motion heralded Bikamiao’s sudden appearance. Lang Tianhun’s eyes narrowed as he assessed the creature. Though unfamiliar with its species, he sensed energies rivaling Guan Yu’s.

“This must be your magic beast companion,” he observed.

“We prefer ‘friends,’” Guan Yu corrected.

“Remarkable. Taming a Dragon Cat as an equal explains much.”

“Dragon Cat?”

“You didn’t know its breed?”

In truth, Guan Yu remained ignorant but feigned indifference. “Why bother? It heeds my commands regardless.”

Dropping the subject, Lang Tianhun gestured toward Lang Duhua (Wolf Poison Flower). “Recall her?”

Guan Yu nodded. “Lang Duhua, if I’m not mistaken.”

The woman approached, her expression inscrutable. “Hello again.”

Her uncharacteristic softness unsettled Guan Yu. Before he could respond, Lang Tianming barked, “Hey! The lady’s waiting! You deaf?”

“My apologies,” Guan Yu recovered. “A pleasure to meet you again.”

“Enough theatrics,” Lang Tianhun cut in. “Lang Duhua, confirm yesterday’s report.”

Blushing crimson, she murmured, “Deputy Leader… it’s true.”

“Hah! Guan Yu, your influence astonishes!”

“I don’t follow.”

“Then let me enlighten you.” Lang Tianhun’s smile turned razor-edged. “Our Ice Queen here, who once slew men for glancing too long, now sighs your name in her sleep. What witchcraft did you employ?”

**Chapter 1434: A Bloodstained Rise**

Guan Yu stiffened. Lang Tianhun continued, “Our War Wolf Mercenaries began as thirty souls. Losses whittled us to ten, battered by scorn and monster attacks. Yet we endured.”

His eyes glinted savagely. “When a larger guild tried absorbing us, we slaughtered them—then razed their base. Eight hundred perished that night. A mother begged mercy for her child… then died smiling when I promised safety before snapping the babe’s neck. A kinder lie, no?”

“You call that kindness?” Guan Yu spat.

“Survival demands ruthlessness. Afterwards, recruits flocked to our banner—but only the ruthless and strong joined our inner circle. Lang Duhua was molded thus.”

“And you think I altered her?”

“She dreamt of you! Deny it?”

“Ask her directly. Dreams don’t equate to affection.”

“Shameless! True men own their deeds!”

Tension crackled until Lang Duhua interjected, “Deputy Leader, cease this farce.”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “You’ve been toying with me?”

Bikamiao hissed, “Let’s fight!”

“Wait,” Guan Yu cautioned. “They outmatch us. Bide your time.”

Lang Tianhun chuckled. “Only the dream was fabricated. Now—three questions: Why ally with elves? What if we keep Locke? Is the Elf Princess truly with you?”

**Chapter 1435: Intelligence**

As Guan Yu hesitated, Bikamiao whispered, “Try trading information like last time!”

Nodding, Guan Yu addressed the War Wolves. “I’ll answer… if you reciprocate.”

Lang Tianhua warned, “Second Brother, he’s scheming!”

Lang Tianhun waved him off. “Speak.”
