“Correct, that’s me,” Young Master Feng replied. The moment he spoke, several black-clad figures sprang from all directions, each wielding Japanese battle swords over a meter long. They slashed toward Young Master Feng, a sight so terrifying it nearly startled his soul from his body.

As the blades of five or six men were about to cleave into Young Master Feng’s skull, the old man standing at the entrance suddenly moved.

**Chapter 2189: Shrimp Soldiers and Crab Generals**

The entire Feng family compound was now steeped in tension. Many servants and bodyguards, rudely awakened from their slumber, stumbled about drowsily, muttering curses under their breath.

“Damn it, can’t even get a proper night’s sleep on our last evening here.”

The Feng family’s decline was evident. Now, even scavengers dared to pick at their remains.

“Which shameless bastard is disturbing my rest?”

Normally, such tension was unheard of in the Feng household. Over time, the bodyguards had grown complacent, especially under these circumstances. Though their training had yielded some results, their current assembly was painfully sluggish.

Guan Yu, clutching the wooden box, lunged toward the iron gate with lightning speed, but time seemed to be slipping away. Though his eyes hadn’t yet adjusted to the darkness, faint light from beyond the gate revealed his position—still four meters away.

The iron gates were nearly shut, leaving only a foot-wide gap. They closed rapidly; at this rate, escape would be impossible.

In desperation, Guan Yu drew the military dagger from his belt mid-sprint and thrust it forward. *Crack!* The blade jammed between the gates, halting their movement.

With the dagger’s length under thirty centimeters, Guan Yu first slid the wooden box outside, then squeezed through sideways.

The dagger, now hopelessly wedged and slightly bent, bore the immense force of the gates. Only its superior quality prevented it from snapping.

Guan Yu had no time to dwell. Snatching the box, he fled.

Within the Feng compound, all bodyguards had assembled in record time—a testament to their rigorous training. The simultaneous blaring of every alarm signaled grave danger.

The Feng family’s alarm system had multiple tiers, typically localized. For all alarms to sound at once meant catastrophe—a truth only Young Master Feng fully grasped.

Bare-chested and clad only in shorts, Young Master Feng burst from his bedroom, barking orders in the courtyard.

“A starved camel is still larger than a horse” perfectly described the Fengs. Over sixty bodyguards now filled the courtyard.

Knowing the southern building’s vault had been breached, Young Master Feng acted swiftly: a dozen guards blockaded the main entrance while others encircled the structure.

The southern building, long a fortified priority, blazed under harsh spotlights from surrounding walls. The glare rendered everything outside indistinct—a blinding barrier.

Guan Yu, unprepared for such rapid response, found exits sealed and visibility nil. Instead of retreating, he ascended to the third floor—a space of conference halls and banquet rooms.

In the surveillance room, Young Master Feng watched Guan Yu on the monitors, box in hand. Snatching a microphone, he growled, “Guan Yu, did you mistake my home for a marketplace?”

Startled, Guan Yu initially thought Young Master Feng had entered, but the voice boomed from ceiling speakers.

“If you can hear me, I can hear you,” Guan Yu retorted. “With your move tomorrow, I merely came to… assist.”

Young Master Feng sneered. “I’ve conceded to your influence, yet you push further—stealing from my home? Imagine the scandal for Huayu Group.”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu lit a cigarette from a nearby box. “Fine tobacco,” he remarked, inhaling deeply. “Pity the moisture dulled its aroma.”

“You insolent fool!” Young Master Feng spat. “You won’t leave alive tonight!”

The alarms’ wail even roused the Feng patriarch. “Xiaohu, what’s happening?”

Feng Xihu, already anxious about Guan Yu’s predicament, soothed, “Just a thief, Father. Brother will handle it.”

As the patriarch fretted, Xihu added, “Rest now. I’ll investigate.”

Unfazed by threats, Guan Yu plotted escape. “Young Master Feng, do you truly believe these shrimp soldiers and crab generals can detain me?”

The taunt struck home. Remembering Sha Aman’s grisly end—two elite masters felled by Guan Yu—Young Master Feng knew ordinary guards stood little chance.

Though initially thrilled at trapping Guan Yu, doubts surfaced. Still, opportunity demanded action. After whispering orders to an underling, he warned through the mic: “Don’t overplay your arrogance. Should I call the police?”

**Chapter 2190: Front Page News**

Legally, Guan Yu’s trespassing and theft would be indefensible. “Clever,” Guan Yu admitted. “But do you think I fear your law-enforcement puppets? Alerting them would only free me.”

His bravado masked real concern. Police intervention meant dealing with that obstinate policewoman, prolonged detention, and scandalous headlines: *Huayu Chairman Caught Red-Handed in Feng Estate Burglary*—a humiliation Guan Yu couldn’t afford.

Young Master Feng had no intention of involving authorities. “Come out, Guan Yu. Negotiate, and spare yourself a bloody fight.”

The offer reeked of deceit. The Fengs possessed firearms—handguns, even a sniper rifle. Snipers now positioned, awaiting clear shots.

“We’ve nothing to discuss,” Guan Yu countered. “Unless you’ve noticed I’m stalling for reinforcements?”

The bluff aimed to unsettle. Guan Yu preferred thinning enemy numbers through confined combat rather than facing open gunfire.

As stalemate lingered, Feng Xihu emerged from the east building. Seeing guards swarming the south block—many armed, a sniper visible—her heart clenched.

Despite Guan Yu’s role in her family’s ruin, love overrode loyalty. Determined to save him, she pushed through the cordon.

“Stop her!” Young Master Feng roared through speakers, but too late—Xihu darted inside.

“Why?” Guan Yu demanded calmly as she reached the third floor.

Tearfully, Xihu warned, “Don’t exit! Snipers—”

“GODDAMMIT!” Young Master Feng’s scream echoed estate-wide. In the surveillance room, he stomped the microphone barefoot, slicing his sole open.

“Why help me?” Guan Yu pressed.

Xihu shook her head. “You’re mistaken. Without me, you’d never escape.”

“Those guards and a sniper can’t hold me.”

“It’s not just them,” she revealed. “My brother never dismissed any guards. Hundreds await outside. This was all a trap.”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. “From the start? The disabled alarms… the fingerprint theft… the guards’ act—all orchestrated?”

“By Bi’erlin’s design,” Xihu confirmed.

In the surveillance room, as a servant bandaged Young Master Feng’s foot, Bi’erlin lounged nearby. “Calm yourself,” the foreigner said in broken Chinese. “With a dozen snipers, not even a god could flee.”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu pieced it together: the Fengs’ apparent decline was theater. Bill Family support had secretly stabilized them. Huayu’s acquired shares meant nothing—discarded factories mere trifles.

Xihu’s tears fell freely. “When we visited the Bill family, the ransom for me… that was false. We’d already secured their aid.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. He’d walked into an elaborate snare.

**Chapter 2191: The Trap Sprung**

“You’re saying tonight was bait?”

Xihu nodded. Guan Yu replayed events: the lax security, the staged resignation—all to lure him into complacency. Even the patriarch’s fingerprint had been willingly offered.

Outside, Bi’erlin’s sniper team waited. Inside, Guan Yu stood surrounded, outmanned and outgunned. Xihu’s intervention was his sole advantage—but could he trust it?

As Young Master Feng seethed and Bi’erlin smirked, Guan Yu assessed options. The wooden box—its contents unknown—weighed in his grip. Escape seemed impossible, yet surrender unthinkable.

The game had reached its endgame. Every move now carried mortal stakes.
