“Guan Yu, no matter what I say to him next, don’t speak up or act impulsively. Promise me, okay?” Before Guan Yu could ask more questions, Xia Yue’er added urgently.

To be honest, this was the first time Guan Yu had seen Xia Yue’er look so solemn. He could only nod reflexively.

Seeing his agreement, Xia Yue’er turned around, her beautiful eyes blazing at Li Tian. “Speak! What exactly do you want?”

Witnessing the intimate display between Guan Yu and Xia Yue’er right before him, Li Tian’s jealousy flared, yet he felt powerless. “Yue’er, don’t you already know what’s in my heart?”

“We’re impossible! I’ve said it countless times, and even if I repeat it a thousand more, it won’t change. I beg you, stop harassing me! Please!”

Stunned by Xia Yue’er’s resolute stance, Li Tian froze momentarily before suddenly jabbing a finger at Guan Yu behind her. “Why? Is it because of him? What does he have that I don’t? I, Li Tian, have everything—wealth, women flocking to me—yet I’ve turned them all down for you! I even begged my father to let me study abroad in America with you! And him?”

Shifting his glare to Guan Yu, he sneered, “He’s just a penniless fool who rides the bus every day, hiding behind a woman. Am I wrong, ‘Classmate Guan Yu’?”

Xia Yue’er immediately felt Guan Yu’s hand tremble in hers. She knew that if not for his earlier promise, he would’ve lunged forward already.

A ripple of guilt swept through her. She had never acknowledged being his girlfriend, yet he’d endured years of her teasing and now bore this humiliation for her sake… A tear slid down her cheek as a resolve solidified in her heart.

“You’re right—you have money and women. But to me, you’re nothing. And him—” She cast a meaningful glance at Guan Yu, “—is the only man I’ll ever have in this lifetime!”

*The only man I’ll ever have.*

The words struck Guan Yu like a thunderclap. Had he not heard it himself, he’d think this a dream. Three years of silent devotion—had it finally borne fruit?

Li Tian stood equally stunned. The arrogant young master, who’d never faced such humiliation, felt the seeds of hatred take root in his heart—love curdling into spite.

At that moment, a taxi passed by. Xia Yue’er hastily flagged it down, dragging Guan Yu into the vehicle without a backward glance.

Watching them speed away, Li Tian’s face twisted. “You wretched pair. You refuse the easy path? Then taste hardship! Today, you’ll witness the true means of Young Master Li! What I can’t have, no one shall!”

He stormed back to his car and barked at the hulking man beside him, “Follow them!”

Inside the taxi, Guan Yu and Xia Yue’er gazed out opposite windows, mutual silence thickening the air.

“Thank you.”

“I’m sorry.”

After minutes of quiet, their voices intertwined. Meeting each other’s eyes, they shared a smile—all lingering awkwardness dissolving like mist.

An hour later, the taxi halted at a mountain’s base. The driver refused to navigate the rugged path ahead, forcing them to disembark. A narrow trail wound upward, likely carved temporarily for the archaeological excavation.

Contrary to Guan Yu’s expectations, the remote site wasn’t deserted. News of the ancient human ruins had drawn curious visitors. Makeshift tents dotted flatter areas, selling drinks and outdoor supplies to travelers.

To stock up, Guan Yu approached a stall manned by an elderly woman in a black padded coat, head bowed. Her weathered face suggested seventy-odd years. *Why is someone her age working in this cold? Where are her children?*

“Two bottled waters. How much?”

“Twenty yuan!” she replied without looking up.

Guan Yu’s sympathy evaporated. *Twenty for two bottles? Highway robbery! No wonder she’s out here.*

Xia Yue’er joined him, her attention captured by bizarre bone ornaments on display. “Wow, granny, where did you get these? They’re beautiful!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. *How are these jagged bones ‘beautiful’…*

“One hundred each!”

“What?!” Guan Yu spluttered. “That’s extortion! These rotten—” Xia Yue’er clamped a hand over his mouth, glaring. “Another word, and I’ll take back what I said this morning!”

He instantly complied, scratching his head sheepishly. “Uh… carry on.”

Chuckling, Xia Yue’er perused the ornaments while Guan Yu wandered. His expression froze—a white BMW crept into view down the road.

“Ah!”

Xia Yue’er’s cry snapped his attention. She held a bone bracelet, marveling. “Look! Its shape—isn’t it like a crescent moon?”

The old woman stiffened imperceptibly.

Guan Yu peered closer. “Overreacting. It’s a dog’s tooth.”

The woman’s head jerked up, milky eyes blazing. “Foolish child! This is no dog’s tooth!”

Baffled by her intensity, Guan Yu muttered, “Okay, okay. No need to shout.”

“Granny, forgive our ignorance,” Xia Yue’er interjected, offering the bracelet. “Could you explain?”

The woman lunged upright, seizing Xia Yue’er’s wrist with startling strength. “Crescent Princess… Could it truly be you? I’ve waited so long!”

Xia Yue’er paled. “I-I don’t understand! Are you frightened by this birthmark? I’ll cover it—” She gestured to the crimson crescent marking her wrist, mirroring the bracelet’s shape.

“Princess… Don’t you remember me? I’m—”

Guan Yu yanked Xia Yue’er back. “She’s delusional. Let’s go!” He tossed twenty yuan onto the counter.

“But… She seemed to have something important—”

“Her mind’s addled from neglect. Forget it. Weren’t you desperate to see the ruins?”

The mention reignited Xia Yue’er’s zeal, pushing the encounter aside. Exiting the stall, Guan Yu scanned for the BMW—now vanished.

“What’re you staring at?”

“Nothing. Let’s go.” He grinned awkwardly.

“Look! A crowd!” Xia Yue’er pointed uphill where people clustered around a cave mouth—the excavation site.

“That must be it.”

They ascended the makeshift stone steps, reaching the cave thirty minutes later. A throng of tourists, journalists, and archaeologists milled outside, barred by guards.

“Why won’t you let us in? We won’t interfere!”

“We traveled thousands of kilometers! At least let us peek!”

The guards remained impassive. Guan Yu and Xia Yue’er exchanged dismayed glances—was this trip futile?

“Silence!” A bespectacled professor emerged, adjusting his glasses. “Today’s work is too delicate for disturbances. However…”

Groans erupted. “Just say no!”

“…A select few may enter.” He began choosing established reporters and experts from the crowd.

“Any hope for us?” Guan Yu whispered as Xia Yue’er strained on tiptoes, waving frantically.

The professor suddenly approached. “Miss Xia Yue’er?”

She blinked. “Y-yes… How do you know me?”

“Come inside.” He turned abruptly.

Hesitating at the threshold, Xia Yue’er demanded, “Explain first.”

The professor chuckled. “Stubborn as your father, Xia Mingwu! We were classmates. Visited you as a child—now look at you, all grown with a… dashing boyfriend.” He nodded at their clasped hands.

Both flushed. “You talk too much!” they chorused.

Laughing heartily, he continued, “Your father called. A thesis project, eh? I’m Cheng Yaohai—call me Uncle Cheng.”

As they ventured into the cavernous depths, Cheng Yaohai teased, “You’ll soon see why today’s work is pivotal…”

The tunnel widened into branching chambers, awe-inspiring in scale. Guan Yu marveled—this primordial engineering feat rivaled modern wonders.

“Nearly there.” Cheng Yaohai indicated a lit chamber ahead, buzzing with activity.

A worker frowned at the newcomers. “Professor Cheng, why so many?”

“They’re with me.”

Xia Yue’er pressed, “Uncle Cheng, what’s so crucial about today?”

He smiled enigmatically. “Patience. All will be revealed.”
