“I also find it difficult to choose,” said Wang Jun. “If we prioritize lightness, pine and poplar wood are both lightweight options, but their hardness is lacking. If we opt for jujube or willow wood, the hardness suffices, but the weight becomes excessive. Wearing such heavy wood on our shoes for extended periods would clearly be impractical.”

“I believe we should still choose lighter wood,” Guan Yu countered. “By increasing the thickness of the wooden soles, we can ensure sufficient durability while maintaining lightness. Walking on sand differs from traversing solid ground—extreme hardness isn’t necessary.”

“Moreover,” he continued, “the primary purpose of these wooden soles is to prevent us from sinking into the sand and reduce exertion. If the wood’s weight causes fatigue, their utility diminishes entirely.”

“Let’s follow Guan Yu’s suggestion,” Siqi agreed enthusiastically. “He’s right—lightweight wood with slightly thicker soles will work perfectly. Sand isn’t abrasive enough to wear them down quickly.”

Under the timber merchant’s guidance, Guan Yu selected pine planks approximately two centimeters thick. “This thickness is ideal,” he mused. “Thinner planks might crack under pressure, while thicker ones would hinder movement—especially in desert conditions.”

Examining the thirty-centimeter-wide planks, Guan Yu proposed splitting them lengthwise. “Sixteen to seventeen centimeters per sole should suffice. The length need only match our shoes for comfortable strides.”

After finalizing specifications, Guan Yu instructed, “Master craftsman, please produce a prototype based on these measurements for testing.”

The shopkeeper nodded. “Please wait momentarily. We’ll divide the planks using handsaws—our only available tool.”

Guan Yu contemplated adding holes to secure the soles with cloth straps. Directly binding them to footwear risked discomfort during prolonged use. Recalling traditional sandal designs from his homeland, he envisioned three front straps and one heel strap for secure yet comfortable fastening.

“The challenge lies in finding elastic material for the ankle strap,” he remarked. “Beast tendons could serve this purpose admirably.”

“Master craftsman, can you bore small holes in these planks?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Certainly,” the shopkeeper replied. “Typically we use carving knives, but that creates oversized holes. For slender cloth passages, I’ll employ heated iron rods. The charring will blacken the edges—does this concern you?”

“Not at all,” Guan Yu assured. “Aesthetics matter little for functional footwear.”

Marking six drilling points—four frontal, two rear—Guan Yu watched as the craftsman expertly treated the charred holes, leaving them serviceable despite slight discoloration.

After securing prototype straps with provisional ropes, Guan Yu test-fitted the creation. “The fastening needs elasticity,” Wang Jun observed. “Rubber would be ideal.”

“Precisely!” Guan Yu exclaimed. “Lacking rubber, we’ll substitute beast tendons. Shopkeeper, where might we procure these?”

“Numerous material shops carry them,” the craftsman gestured toward a diagonal storefront. “That establishment should suffice.”

Satisfied, Guan Yu ordered twenty-two pairs. “These can be completed by dusk,” the shopkeeper estimated. Guan Yu prepaid generously with silver ingots, dismissing exact change.

As they departed, Siqi questioned the lavish payment. Wang Jun chuckled, “Guan Yu’s habitual generosity—silver flows like water from his pockets.”

Later, while procuring fabrics and tendons, Guan Yu suggested, “Those fatigued may return with supplies. Siqi and I will continue exploring.”

Wang Jun dragged a reluctant A’ze away, hissing, “Must we interrupt their romantic stroll? Play the glaring lantern if you wish!”

At dusk, the couple emerged from an inn, Siqi’s flushed cheeks betraying their afternoon’s intimacy. “They’ve likely collected the orders,” Guan Yu remarked. “Let’s rendezvous at camp.”

“Wait,” Siqi interjected. “We require a direction-finding needle—vital for desert navigation. Unlike stellar navigation, it functions regardless of weather.”

Though skeptical about the crude compass-like device—a bimetallic disk with iron pointer—Guan Yu acquiesced. “Practical preparation trumps theoretical perfection.”

Reunited with their group at a respectable inn, Guan Yu distributed the wooden soles. “Adjust the straps to your footwear’s dimensions,” he instructed.

As night fell, Lin Chen excused himself mysteriously. Ling Su’s abrupt departure prompted speculation. “Gambling debts?” Guan Yu mused. “Regardless, his fate concerns me little.”

Unbeknownst to them, Ling Su shadowed Lin Chen through twilight streets, determined to uncover his secrets—beginning another clandestine chapter in their desert-bound saga.
