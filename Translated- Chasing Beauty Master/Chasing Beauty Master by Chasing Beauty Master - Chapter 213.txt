The bodyguard was adjusting his stance, but Guan Yu was likewise massaging his elbow tip. Though he'd gained the upper hand in their previous clash, Newton's third law remained unforgiving. Without mastery of Golden Bell Armor or Iron Shirt techniques, his joint burned with searing pain.

He rose from the sofa, buttocks lifting as he squared against this opponent who demanded full attention.

"President Wan, isn't this excessive?" Li Xi's voice simmered with restrained anger. "I told you he's no outsider—he came to negotiate."

"Hmph." Wan Qianshan (Myriad Peaks Mountain) declared with tyrannical grandeur. "I said I dislike him. Negotiations or not, he'll crawl from this room."

The bodyguard moved again—fist coiling, power gathering—a deceptively simple strike aimed straight for Guan Yu's face. The punch accelerated brutally, its shadow expanding rapidly in Guan Yu's vision.

A faint smirk curled Guan Yu's lips. Gravity System activated. Forty percent weight augmentation slammed onto the attacker. The bodyguard's fist slowed mid-flight, his entire assault suddenly mired in invisible quicksand. Full-force strikes under deceleration risked self-injury—a truth reflected in the confusion of onlooking guards and the assailant's own paling face.

Retreat flashed through the bodyguard's mind—too late. Guan Yu seized his wrist, yanking forward to disrupt balance. As the man stumbled chest-first, Guan Yu's knee rose like a piston.

Trained by the Godfather of the Taiwanese underworld, the bodyguard proved his worth—momentary panic yielding to ice-cold focus. Leg met leg in mid-air. Already off-balance, the guard lost footing entirely.

Guan Yu's smirk widened. Gravity effects flipped—40% weight reduction on himself. He ducked beneath the guard's arm, right shoulder driving upward. A textbook shoulder throw sent the man crashing earthward.

_Finish the wounded._ Guan Yu's foot reared to crush ribs—when danger prickled his spine. He lunged forward blindly, evading a second guard's strike by hairsbreadth.

The new attacker's fist whistled through empty air. Feet pistoned against floorboards as this battle-hardened elite—forged through countless street wars—pressed the assault. Guan Yu found himself cornered, forced into desperate parries.

"Fucking wheel tactics?" Guan Yu spat through gritted teeth. "I've got a Healing System, bastards. Let's dance."

He stopped dodging. Chest exposed. The guard's fist hammered solar plexus.

Air exploded from Guan Yu's lungs as he staggered back six steps, blood trickling from his lip. The guard pressed mercilessly—another punch already arcing toward bruised flesh.

Guan Yu hawked crimson phlegm, feinted left. The strike missed. Behind him, the first guard—now risen—swung a killing blow Guan Yu's danger sense had already predicted.

Two attackers now, flanking high and low with synchronicity that drew Guan Yu's grudging admiration. Right arm blocked an overhead strike while left leg intercepted a sweeping kick.

Abdominal muscles coiled. A spinning heel kick bought breathing room—briefly. The guards advanced anew, relentless automatons. Guan Yu bided time, waiting for the split-second opening to drop both.

Fists traded—Guan Yu absorbed a punch to deliver his own. His lips twitched. _There._ The struck guard stumbled back. Guan Yu pursued.

Power gathered. Fist cocked. Bone-Breaking Fist technique merged with Triple Combo—a seamless flurry aimed center mass. This strike bore catastrophic weight, ferocious where previous blows were mere warnings.

The guard gritted teeth, bracing to absorb impact. His partner closed in—sacrifice play acceptable with numerical advantage.

Knuckles collided.

*Crack.*

Arm bone shattered. The guard catapulted backward, skull cracking against wall before slumping unconscious.

Simultaneously, the partner's strike arrived—fist trailing sonic booms. A spine-snapping blow...

...that met empty air as Guan Yu pivoted. Gravity System shifted—40% weight on the fist. The guard's eyes widened mid-swing.

In combat's razor-edge moments, 0.1 seconds decide fates. Guan Yu's sidestep morphed into drunken master sway—body angled 45 degrees as he slipped inside the guard's guard. Elbow became spearpoint aimed at heart. Gravity System flipped again.

*Thud.*

The guard choked blood, feet leaving ground as he flew toward Wan Qianshan. The triad lord stood unmoving as a shadowy figure materialized—moveless face, tai chi circles redirecting the human projectile with effortless precision. A pistol emerged, trained on Guan Yu.

Panting, Guan Yu locked eyes with the new threat—Huang Ming (Yellow Clarity). Danger radiated from this statue-like man who'd intercepted a 200-pound missile without shifting stance.

Wan Qianshan's applause cracked the tension. "Marvelous. Your skills impress."

Guan Yu wiped blood. "Yours don't. Nor your courage."

The triad lord's smile chilled. "I admire spirit. Let's forget unpleasantness. Join me—wealth, women, power yours for the taking."

"Your throne included?" Guan Yu grinned wolfishly.

Wan Qianshan's eyes frosted. "Youth requires...boundaries."

"Then your word's worthless." Guan Yu spread empty hands. "Why do fools follow you?"

"Cripple him."

Huang Ming's finger tightened—but Guan Yu's roar froze the moment: "WAIT!"

Two silenced shots answered. Guan Yu's pupils constricted as coins in his mind hummed—Gravity System overloading. Bullets slowed...

...but still grazed thighs as he twisted. Blood sheeted down legs as Guan Yu became wind itself—40% weightless charge.

Huang Ming's second shot plowed ceilingward as wrists wrestled. A knee aimed for groins forced separation. Guan Yu's counterpunch cratered Huang Ming's chest, sending the pistol skittering.

Blood-flecked and heaving, Guan Yu pressed—Bone-Breaking Triple Combo unleashed. Huang Ming met it with brutish counterpunch.

*Boom.*

Five steps back versus two. Guan Yu's legs painted crimson. Huang Ming wiped blood, reassessing.

**Chapter 530: Cripple Him**

**Chapter 531: Master's Demeanor**

"Hold!" Guan Yu's bellow froze Huang Ming's trigger finger. The gunman glanced at Wan Qianshan—receiving only arctic indifference. Twin silenced shots barked.

Guan Yu's world burned red. The ancient coin in his mind screamed—Gravity System maxing on bullets. Thighs blazed as he vector-shifted, rounds embedding in sofa.

Blood rivers down legs. Rage ignited. Weightless charge closed the gap before Huang Ming's third shot. Wristlock. Groin kick dodged. Chest punch landed. Pistol flew.

Huang Ming staggered. Guan Yu pressed—Bone-Breaking Fist's killing stroke. The statue-like man anchored himself, counterpunch meeting fury with granite force.

Five retreating steps told the tale—Guan Yu's strongest strike matched. Thigh wounds geysered. Across the room, Huang Ming's mask cracked—first flicker of respect.
