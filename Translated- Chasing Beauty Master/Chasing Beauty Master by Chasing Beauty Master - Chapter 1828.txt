Patriarch Cao seethed with anger yet found himself powerless. After all, Cao Di had initiated the verbal abuse in public—behavior undeniably excessive. Still, the patriarch considered insults trivial compared to the vicious beating inflicted.

As for whether Jiang Yuan Kai would retaliate against the Cao family, the patriarch deemed it unlikely. Surely a man of Jiang’s stature understood broader principles and wouldn’t pursue formal charges over such petty grievances.

“Stop pestering me here,” Patriarch Cao snapped impatiently. “Use that time to tend to Di’er instead. Nothing will come of this—Jiang Yuan Kai hasn’t reached the point of openly opposing our Cao clan.”

In the residence of Imperial Son-in-Law Jiang, three figures sat around an expansive round table in the main hall: Jiang Yuan Kai, his daughter Jiang Xin (Heart), and the Princess. Two maidservants lingered by the distant doorway.

The Princess broke the silence. “Yuan Kai, what transpired during your meeting with Wan Hong? I heard you quarreled with Patriarch Cao?”

Jiang Yuan Kai’s face darkened. “That Cao Di called me a ‘pretty-faced freeloader’ to my face! How could I swallow such humiliation?”

The Princess merely cleared her throat and lifted her chin slightly. Privately, she agreed—her husband’s standing in the capital indeed relied on her influence.

“Wan Hong intervened on my behalf and struck Cao Di,” Jiang Yuan Kai continued. “When Patriarch Cao confronted him at Wanyang Tavern, I had to step in.”

“So Wan Hong has such righteous spirit!” Jiang Xin (Heart) interjected.

“What of the East Sea Dragon Pearl?” the Princess pressed.

“Authentic beyond doubt,” Jiang Yuan Kai affirmed. “A Kyoto scholar confirmed it’s the only one in existence. Wan Hong and I have agreed to pursue the East Sea Treasure together.”

“But without clues or even rumors of its existence,” the Princess countered, “how can you search?”

“This requires long-term planning. For now, stay indoors to avoid complications.” Jiang Yuan Kai had decided to follow Guan Yu (Cosmos)’s advice—fake gifting the pearl to the Emperor to divert attention.

After resting and exploring Kyoto, Guan Yu (Cosmos) arrived at Vermilion Beauty Opera House at dusk with his luggage. The theater buzzed with patrons purchasing tickets for that evening’s performance.

Stopped by unfamiliar staff, Guan Yu (Cosmos) stated coolly, “Summon Chu Fan (Ordinary) for me.”

The attendant scrutinized Guan Yu (Cosmos)’s demeanor and attire before departing. Moments later, Chu Fan (Ordinary) emerged, waving briskly.

“Wan Hong! You promised to come this morning!”

“Time slipped away while sightseeing,” Guan Yu (Cosmos) replied.

Chu Fan (Ordinary) thrust forward a document. “Review our agreement—rent-free use of the theater in exchange for ten percent of this year’s earnings.”

Having waited anxiously all day, Chu Fan (Ordinary) finally relaxed as they signed the contract. With financial pressures eased, he vowed to repay overdue wages to his troupe tomorrow.

After settling into his prepared quarters—a clean but modest room in the sprawling compound—Guan Yu (Cosmos) wandered through arched corridors flanked by aging yet stately buildings. Only four residents occupied the vast courtyard: Chu Fan (Ordinary), his deputy, the deputy’s mother, and now Guan Yu (Cosmos).

As performance time neared, Guan Yu (Cosmos) headed to observe Chu Fan (Ordinary)’s acclaimed artistry, curious about the hype surrounding traditional opera.

Meanwhile, Jiang Xin (Heart) paced her chambers, desperate to attend the show. Barred by guards, she clambered through a window, tearing her white skirt on the sill. Undeterred, she fashioned the damaged garment into a sleek gown and crept toward the rear gate—only to find sentries blocking her path.

Snatching a wooden club, she ambushed the guards but botched the strikes, hitting their skulls instead of napes.

“Why aren’t you unconscious?!” she demanded as the men rubbed their heads.

“Strike the back of the neck, milady,” one groaned.

Just as she raised the club again, Jiang Yuan Kai appeared. “Xin’er! Climbing windows? You could’ve been hurt!”

“Let me go, Father! I’ll suffocate trapped here!”

“The East Sea Dragon Pearl makes you a target,” he implored. “Once we resolve this, you’ll have freedom.”

“Curse Wan Hong for this!” she spat. “That wretched pearl cages me!”
