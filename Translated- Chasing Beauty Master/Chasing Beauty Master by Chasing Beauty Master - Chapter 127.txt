Chapter 310: We Call the Shots Now

The department head was visibly taken aback by Guan Yu's assertive manner, his face flushing with embarrassment. "Ahem... Very well. You... discuss among yourselves first," he coughed awkwardly before retreating from the conference room.

With only student council members remaining, Guan Yu lazily stretched and surveyed the group. "So you all disagree? Those who object can leave now!" His careless declaration hung in the air as stunned silence enveloped the room.

Xu Wei finally erupted, veins bulging at his temples. "Who do you think you are? None of us accept you as Student Council President! What qualifications do you have to command our respect?"

Guan Yu chuckled, turning with amusement toward his challenger. "My qualifications aren't yours to question. The school appointed me, so here I stand. Don't like it? The door's right there. Make you submit?" His smirk widened. "Couldn't care less if you croak. Leave now and replacements will fill your seats before sunset. Believe that?"

Xu Wei's bluster deflated like punctured balloon, reduced to incoherent muttering under Guan Yu's unrelenting gaze.

"Those who protested earlier," Guan Yu's voice turned icy as he scanned the room. "Why remain? Hoping to linger?" When no one moved, he spread his hands magnanimously. "No objections? Splendid. Let's continue. Truthfully, this pathetic student council doesn't interest me..." He paused, casually adjusting his collar. "But since they've shoved me into this role, I'll play along. You handle the grunt work while I relax. Any complaints?"

As he clapped Xu Wei's shoulder, the former leader flinched. "Previous department heads retain their positions. Routine matters remain under your control." His finger jabbed toward a list. "Compile everyone's roles and departments for me. Minor adjustments may follow." The threat came sweetly wrapped: "Keep me happy, you stay comfortable. Cross me..." His grin turned feral. "My talent pool overflows. See those eager replacements?" He gestured toward Niu Le's group.

Xu Wei's faction sat stewing in silent outrage. How could school administrators appoint this ruffian as their leader?

"Enough dawdling." Guan Yu commandeered a chair beside Xu Wei. "Resume your meeting. Well? Speak up!"

Xu Wei glared at the table. "You're President now. What's my role?"

"Secretary," Guan Yu answered cheerfully. "Temporarily handle operations until further notice."

"Not interested!" Xu Wei surged to his feet. "Wen Qing! I'm quitting. What about you?"

The raven-haired beauty tilted her head. "Leave then." Her indifference hung like guillotine.

"You..." Xu Wei's jaw worked before he stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Guan Yu surveyed the remaining members. "Others following? Last chance." When none moved, he clapped decisively. "Splendid! Let's redistribute power. Introduce your departments."

After rounds of presentations, Guan Yu began restructuring with casual brutality. "Men's Department gets new leadership. Wang Zhen and Tian Hao - sort your positions." The former head sputtered protests. "Take complaints to them," Guan Yu dismissed, already turning to Wang Yang. "As Vice President, you'll handle daily operations."

Wen Qing arched an eyebrow. "What exactly will you oversee?"

"The most leisurely department. Which requires minimal effort?"

"Girls' Department!" Wang Yang volunteered eagerly, earning Wen Qing's death glare.

"Perfect!" Guan Yu's fist thumped the table. "I'll take that!"

"You..." Wen Qing's nails dug into the wood. "Where does that leave me?"

"As Vice President assisting Wang Yang," came the airy reply. When she muttered curses, Guan Yu continued unperturbed: "Niu Le becomes Girls' Department Deputy. Both gender departments undergo restructuring."

As murmurs rose about recruitment autonomy, Guan Yu waved concerns away. "From now on, we operate independently. School inquiries? Direct them to me." His grin promised untouchable authority.

Chapter 311: All for Nothing?

The transformed meeting left participants shell-shocked. Guan Yu's gangster-style takeover left Men's and Girls' Departments under his thumb, all responsibilities dumped on Wang Yang and Wen Qing.

While others dispersed to announce changes, Wang Yang lingered obsequiously. "Big Brother Guan, your guidance..."

"Wang Yang, right?" Guan Yu eyed him playfully. "Enough waterworks over past misunderstandings?"

The reference to their bathroom confrontation made Wang Yang flush. "Please... let's bury that."

Their conversation veered to Wen Qing's baffling allegiance. "Strange," Wang Yang mused. "She's Xu Wei's girlfriend yet supported you. Their golden couple status..."

"Golden boy and girl?" Guan Yu snorted. "More like funeral effigies ready for burning." An inexplicable irritation prickled his chest.

When reassembled members gaped at Wen Qing presiding, Guan Yu's entrance caused fresh whispers. The campus troublemaker turned President? After perfunctory announcements, Guan Yu rose to leave.

"Stay!" Wen Qing's command froze him. As others filed out, she pounced like feral cat across the conference table. "Remember me?!" Her accusation hung between them.

"Should I?" Genuine confusion creased his brow.

The phone hurled at his head answered. Wrestling her into submission on the table, Guan Yu barked: "Crazy?!"

"You took my first time!" Her scream echoed. "Finished your business and forgot my face?!" Spittle flew. "All those sweet nothings that night - lies!"

Memory stirred as he scanned her furious features - the tight jeans, wild eyes... "Bar girl? The little wildcat?"

"Your woman!" She hissed, squirming beneath him. "Exhibition? Go ahead! Show everyone your claim!"

Chapter 312: Determined to Be Yours

Guan Yu's grip slackened in shock. Wen Qing pressed her advantage, perching on his lap with serpentine grace. "Well? Ask away."

"This... misunderstanding..." He stammered, hyper-aware of the door. "Xu Wei..."

"Who cares?" Her arms coiled around his neck. "I'm yours. Done is done."

The declaration hung between them - part challenge, part plea. Guan Yu's mind reeled. This wildfire girl demanded ownership he couldn't recall claiming, her body a weapon against his defenses. As she nuzzled closer, the Student Council President realized true power dynamics were only beginning to shift.
