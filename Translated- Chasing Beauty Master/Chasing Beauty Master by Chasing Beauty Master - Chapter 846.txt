Lü Mei crossed her arms and declared, "You're the newcomer here. You should step aside. What gives you the right to compete for favor with us?" Their argument grew increasingly heated, both parties making valid points.

By all logic, Zhang Han should have supported Yang Conghan at this moment, yet she remained silent. Though young, she wasn't foolish—she still hoped to sleep in Guan Yu's room herself. How could she let Sister Yang move in there? That would ruin her future chances!

Xue Jing rose from the sofa and interjected, "Enough bickering. Let's compromise. Conghan, choose any vacant room here. I assure you none have been previously occupied. Since this villa's completion, we've never had more residents than now. Only Guan Yu and I lived here before, so hygiene concerns are unfounded."

Though Xue Jing held no official authority, her status as Guan Yu's woman made her the de facto leader in their eyes. Her words carried weight. Lü Mei turned away with a huff, refusing to engage further. As the quarrel subsided, Lan Yu seized the moment: "Sister Yang, my room is quite clean if you'd consider it..."

Before Yang could respond, Xue Jing cut in sharply, "Enough scheming, Lan Yu. No one gets direct access to Guan Yu's room—not even me. As sisters, we must maintain equality without favoritism." She paused thoughtfully before adding, "From now on, when Guan Yu has needs, we'll use the flipping cards system. I'll have tokens made tomorrow."

"Flipping cards?" Guan Yu chuckled nervously. "Wasn't that for emperors with numerous concubines? With so few of you, isn't this excessive?"

"Silence! You dare complain about having too few?" the women chorused, instantly cowing him. Zhang Han scampered over, stuffing an orange slice into his mouth. "Big brother, with so many sisters around, you still want more?" Her chubby finger pointed suggestively at his groin. "Could you even handle it?"

Grinning inwardly, Guan Yu thought, "Underestimate me? I could handle twice your number!" Yet he wisely kept this to himself, knowing vocalizing it would bring collective wrath.

Xue Jing approached sternly. "You should restrain yourself. You've gathered the city's beauties here already. Bring more, and I'll have Sister Xu build a larger villa!"

The card system found approval as equitable, if pretentious. Even meek A'mei nodded agreement. Yang Conghan's plans thwarted, she settled for a smaller sunlit room beside Lan Yu's—a deliberate choice, as she preferred cozy spaces reminiscent of home.

After servants departed, the women enthusiastically helped Yang clean while Guan Yu handled furniture-moving duties—the sole man's burden. Yang's fastidiousness saw original furnishings discarded, replaced with custom luxury items: a circular bed, massive wardrobe, and new bathtub, all delivered and installed within hours.

Revealing her cleverness, Yang claimed two adjacent rooms—one for sleeping, another for storage—keeping her living space uncluttered. By nightfall, Xue Jing and A'mei cooked dinner as Zhang Han "helped" noisily.

Guanyu practiced martial forms in the courtyard, frustrated by stagnant cultivation. At Second-Class Zun level, physical techniques mattered less than qi refinement and combat intuition. He recalled the cautionary tale of a martial artist obsessed with flashy techniques, ultimately killed by a superior cultivator's single qi blade through the heart—a lesson in prioritizing inner strength over external flourishes.

Interrupted by A'mei's dinner call, Guan Yu turned—then froze. A powerful aura approached. Not Xue Jing's. Familiar yet different... Gamblee? The black-clad informant stood precisely at the estate's perimeter alarms.

Gamblee, Xu Jinglei's trusted operative, contrasted sharply with pale-skinned Jones—a yin-yang pair. The middle-aged woman's revealing leather outfit defied the chill as she delivered urgent news: "The Feng family's contacting Heaven Sect again. Unverified, but I came immediately."

Guan Yu's device had died, explaining missed alerts. As guards approached, he waved them off. "Possible Feng西湖 involvement?" he mused. Though skeptical of the hospitalized Feng heirs' capability, he thanked Gamblee and promised vigilance.

Returning indoors, Guan Yu pondered the Fengs' motives. Were they truly regrouping under Feng西湖? Or was this another ruse? He shelved concerns for dinner, unaware that bedridden Feng少爷 was secretly mobilizing funds for Heaven Sect's elite assassins—a move soon to surface through financial channels monitored by the vigilant Feng西湖.
