Guan Yu took a sip of warm water and continued, "There might be some things you are unaware of. After refining the immortal artifact of Patriarch Menghua, the Eight-Sided Drum Art finally emerged. This cultivation method is divided into four volumes. Earlier this year, one volume appeared in Patriarch Menghua's underground palace. Subsequently, clues about the second volume surfaced—clues pointing directly to Miao City. Hence, any cultivator in the jianghu with even modest capabilities has reason to seek out Miao City."

"Divided into four volumes?" Xiao Mei exclaimed in surprise. "So the Eight-Sided Drum Art in Miao City is merely one fragment?"

"Precisely," Guan Yu nodded.

Xiao Mei pressed further, "This is all news to me. Who obtained that first volume from Patriarch Menghua's underground palace? They say mastering the Eight-Sided Drum Art grants dominion over the jianghu. Is that legend true?"

"Perhaps," Guan Yu replied pensively. "Even after a millennium, none have matched Patriarch Menghua's prowess. The Eight-Sided Drum Art remains the most formidable cultivation method in existence. If one were to obtain all four volumes, they would undoubtedly become the unrivaled sovereign of the martial world. Yet legends warn of the art's demonic nature. What such power might twist its wielder into... that remains uncertain."

"You still haven't answered my crucial question," Xiao Mei persisted. "Who claimed that first volume from the underground palace? Don't tell me you don't know."

"Of course I don't," Guan Yu glanced sideways at Siqi, deciding it prudent to keep the art's whereabouts concealed. As a core disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect, Siqi had been indoctrinated since childhood with the sect's lofty ideals—convictions Guan Yu thought best not to challenge. "I participated in that expedition. The Eight-Sided Drum manifested briefly before vanishing. The Soul Demon Sect accused us of stealing it, though none among us sensed its presence. Conversely, we suspected the Soul Demon Sect themselves, believing their denial mere pretense. What truly concerns all parties are the clues pointing to the next volume's location."

"So Miao City supposedly holds the second volume," Xiao Mei deduced, "which explains why major sects are dispatching forces here?"

"Exactly. Though none can confirm Miao City's emergence or the art's actual presence, we must investigate regardless. We cannot risk the Soul Demon Sect obtaining even a single volume. Should the Demon Sovereign acquire all four..." Guan Yu's voice darkened, "it would herald the jianghu's doom. He would unleash unimaginable slaughter. My master instructed me—if we cannot claim the art, we must destroy it. Better annihilation than letting it fall into wrong hands."

"How ruthlessly pragmatic," Xiao Mei remarked coolly. "Destroy what you cannot possess—typical sect hypocrisy." Though her words bordered on disrespect toward Elder Xuanming, Guan Yu remained unperturbed. The directive had been his own fabrication; Xuanming had never issued such orders.

The situation grew increasingly complex. Even locating Miao City wouldn't guarantee success. Moreover, legends warned that the city would return to the demon realm at dawn unless explorers departed before sunrise. Those trapped within would remain until the next year's fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month—if they survived at all.

"I never realized the Eight-Sided Drum Art had multiple volumes," Xiao Mei sighed, frustration tinging her voice. Her dream of instant supremacy now seemed naively ambitious.

"But wouldn't obtaining even one volume grant significant power?" Xiao Mei pressed.

Guan Yu hesitated. His own experience with the Emperor's Seal volume hadn't yielded dramatic improvements. "Perhaps. The benefits of partial mastery remain unclear. I presume each volume contains Patriarch Menghua's insights—priceless knowledge for any cultivator. However..." His tone turned grave, "possessing even a fragment makes one target. Reveal your acquisition, and the entire jianghu will hunt you."

Xiao Mei nodded, though determination burned beneath her calm demeanor. Even partial power tempted her—dominance remained every cultivator's ultimate desire.

"I almost hope Miao City doesn't appear this year," she mused. "Fewer competitors might improve our odds."

"Wishful thinking," Guan Yu countered. "If the city remains hidden, these desert wastes will swarm with cultivators indefinitely. Peace won't return until next year's appointed time—or until the art is claimed."

Xiao Mei conceded the point. Abandonment wasn't in any cultivator's nature—herself included. Strangely, she now hoped Miao City would manifest, if only to end the suspense.

"Ninety percent certainty," Guan Yu asserted. "The pattern suggests each volume's emergence triggers the next clue. Recent anomalous storms might herald the city's approach."

"If only I could claim that art..." Xiao Mei murmured, half to herself.

Guan Yu smiled faintly. "Fate governs such matters. Locating Miao City is merely the first trial. The art chooses not by strength alone, but through karmic fortune."

"Are you suggesting the art possesses sentience? That it selects its master?"

"Not sentience—chance. When thousands compete, luck becomes decisive." Guan Yu's tone discouraged further inquiry. Some truths were better left unspoken.

Dawn found Siqi meticulously checking supplies. Though their current lodgings were comfortable, desert travel demanded thorough preparation. Guan Yu emerged later, chuckling at the overloaded camel. "Planning to open a bazaar? Lighten the load unless you want our transport collapsing."

Siqi pouted. "Every item's essential! Sandstorms could strike again."

"Essentials only—tents, rations, water." Guan Yu began removing excess bundles. "We're hunting a legendary city, not relocating households."

Outside the Heterodox Sect's compound, the expedition assembled. Xiao Mei waited astride her camel, solitary yet observant. "Finally decided to join us?" she teased. "Your romantic dalliances made everyone wait."

Guan Yu chuckled apologetically. "Shall we begin? May fortune guide us to Miao City."

As the caravan departed, tentative camaraderie bloomed. Even knowing Xiao Mei's serpentine nature, the Cloud Azure disciples found her less fearsome after days of proximity. Whispers circulated about her sister's whereabouts—some speculated hidden among luggage, others imagined mystical concealment.

Wang Jun rode alongside Guan Yu. "How long must we wander this infernal desert? This isn't some leisurely market stroll."

Guan Yu gazed at the shimmering horizon. "Until the sands reveal their secret—or until the Eight-Sided Drum claims its next champion."
