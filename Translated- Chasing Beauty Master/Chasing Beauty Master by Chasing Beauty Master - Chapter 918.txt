“Second Only to Wolf seemed to ponder before saying, ‘Though I quarreled with Sister Yingzi that one time, I never argued with her again afterwards. The household couldn’t take it. During that fight, she smashed nearly everything in the house. I had to buy everything anew afterward.’”

“Heh, seems Yingzi has quite the fiery temper. But you know my own temper isn’t the best. Aren’t you afraid we’d come to blows if you send that spitfire my way?” Guan Yu asked.

“What does your marital squabbling have to do with me? I’m an outsider. Fight however you like—just don’t drag me into it.” Second Only to Wolf spoke as if truly distancing himself from the matter.

Guan Yu eyed his irritating demeanor. “Fine then. If Yingzi maintains that temper around me, I’ll hold you accountable. You’re the one who indulged her fiery nature.”

“Damn it, how is this my fault? Who should I blame then? Out there, I’m a renowned first-class assassin, yet at home I’m sent scrambling by a little girl. Ah, I’m only telling you this—if others knew, the shame would be unbearable.”

Guan Yu solemnly replied, “There’s no shame in this. Yingzi is your blood sister. You’re not intimidated by her—you care deeply, wanting to protect her. That’s why you always yield. This is how an elder brother should act. If you bullied her instead, that’s what would truly earn contempt.”

Chapter 2348: Departure Now

Guan Yu continued gravely, “Yingzi is your own sister. Your deference stems from love, not fear. This is the mark of a true elder brother. Bullying her would be disgraceful.”

“You brat! You’ve monopolized all arguments. What’s left for me to say?” Second Only to Wolf had barely finished when Jinhua called from the doorway: “Hurry inside! Everything’s ready.”

Guan Yu and Second Only to Wolf entered to find Jinhua had laid out liquor and side dishes on the tea table. “I’ve prepared some casual stir-fries in Eastern Huaxia style. I hope they suit Brother Jinci’s tastes,” she said warmly.

“Don’t worry—anything delicious agrees with me!” Jinci’s mouth watered at the aromas. Dragging Guan Yu down, the two began feasting.

They drank and talked until dawn. When A’cai awoke the next morning, the pair were draining their final cups.

After tidying up, Guan Yu instructed, “A’cai, ask Brother Jinci for anything you need. Don’t hesitate. He’ll provide—I’ll reimburse him. Once you leave, obey him and train diligently. Understand?”

“Yes, A’cai understands.”

“Enough fussing like an old woman! Let’s go—this timing’s perfect.” Jinci strode ahead cheerfully, A’cai trailing behind with frequent backward glances at Guan Yu.

Though brief, these days had made A’cai view Guan Yu and Jinhua as true family. Now departing this newfound warmth, reluctance weighed heavily.

After seeing them off, Guan Yu returned indoors and startled—Feng Xihu stood awake by the entrance.

“You’re up? Why stand here?” he asked.

“What happened?” Feng Xihu inquired. After Jinhua’s medicinal treatment, A’cai had carried her to bed. She’d evidently rested well.

Jinhua called out, “Come eat while we talk.” Despite her reservations about Feng Xihu, propriety dictated civility—if only to honor Guan Yu.

“You’ve been unconscious. Let’s eat first,” Guan Yu added. Feng Xihu felt hollow with hunger.

True to her noble upbringing, Feng Xihu ate delicately despite her famished state. Between bites, she asked, “Guan Yu, I only recall our late-night supper. What happened after?” She trusted his integrity—awakening unharmed confirmed this.

“Simple enough. The night-shift waiter at that restaurant drugged our food. When he tried assaulting you, I intervened and brought you here. You’ve slept over a day and night. Jinhua revived you. That’s all.”

Guan Yu summarized tersely, avoiding entanglement. Though Feng Xihu had previously warned him, he maintained distance—especially with Jinhua present.

“I see. Thank you for saving me.”

“Don’t. I may have implicated you. We’re even. Leave after eating.” His tone chilled her.

Stung by his coldness, Feng Xihu set down her chopsticks. After glancing between Guan Yu and Jinhua, she murmured, “I’ll go now. Goodbye.”

Guan Yu considered driving her but reconsidered—she could manage alone. Her department would be searching anyway.

After her departure, Jinhua remarked, “First time I’ve seen you so cold to a beauty. Intentional?”

Guan Yu side-eyed her. “This matter’s settled. I want no further ties—the Fengs and I are destined for conflict. That night, I hoped to learn about the Ten-Thousand Year Demonic Realm from her. Though unsuccessful, we’ve gained clues about your Grandmaster.”

“A silver lining. Without encountering You Dun, we’d still be searching blindly. Speaking of—after eating, let’s check on Dake’s situation.”

Jinhua pitied Feng Xihu. As a woman, she recognized Feng’s love for Guan Yu, torn between family and heart. Unable to oppose either, Feng Xihu suffered most.

Chapter 2349: Too Dangerous Here

Feng Xihu wandered aimlessly, tears streaming freely down her cheeks. She contemplated leaving—escaping places shadowed by Guan Yu. Only elsewhere might she find peace.

At the precinct, suitors abounded, yet Guan Yu’s specter haunted her. She longed for amnesia—to forget and find joy.

Post-meal, Guan Yu and Jinhua returned to Dake’s warehouse, finding Ganbili present.

“Why are you here? Any developments?” Guan Yu asked.

“They won’t escape. But the sisters insist you return today—it’s too dangerous here,” Ganbili urged gravely.

“Today? Impossible. Two more days.”

Jinhua puzzled over the danger. Ganbili pressed, “Refuse, and even you’ll face the sisters’ wrath.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Tell them I’ll return in two days. This is crucial.”

Jinhua interjected, “Why send Jinci and A’cai away? His help could—”

“I kept his involvement secret. We’ll face initial probes. After meeting your Grandmaster, we’ll depart.”

Ganbili relented, “I’ll relay this, but consequences are yours.”

Contacting Xu Jinglei directly, Guan Yu was berated: “Little rascal! Return immediately! I’ve booked your afternoon flight. These forces are beyond control!”

“Sis, I need two days—”

“No! Delay one minute and I’ll tell Eldest Sister. You’ll be grounded indefinitely!”

Chapter 2350: Pleading

“Sis, this isn’t play! Lives hang in balance! Let me stay—”

“Guan Yu!” Xu Jinglei pleaded, “These adversaries alarm even me. You’re overseas—we can’t protect you. If anything happens… Promise me—return now. Travel freely later!”

“Sis, this is life-or-death! My presence here might be Master Qings illness’ last hope. Give me two days—let me face this trial!”

“I said no! This isn’t training—it’s suicide! Must I beg you? Think of Eldest Sister’s heart!” Her voice cracked with desperation.
