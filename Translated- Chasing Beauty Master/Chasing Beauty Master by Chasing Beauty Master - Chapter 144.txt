Every detail was spot-on! He knew him? He didn’t recall ever interacting with this person. Who exactly was he?

Hesitant despite his brashness, Liu Jili now weighed Guan Yu’s threats. What if this guy really intended to fight him to the death?

“You’d better not provoke me! Otherwise, stripping you of that uniform would be as easy as snapping my fingers.”

Liu Jili gritted his teeth, about to roar back in defiance, but Guan Yu tilted his head and sneered, “Still不服气？Tingting—Guo Tingting from the Greater Khingan Mountains! And Zheng the Fatty from Qingya Foot Massage Parlor!”

Huh— Liu Jili froze, eyes bulging as cold sweat drenched him.

He knew about Guo Tingting? And Zheng the Fatty? A few years back, before joining the police, he’d lured a village girl to the city, grown bored, and sold her to Zheng’s parlor. After Guo Tingting tried escaping twice, he and Zheng had beaten her so severely she became vegetative. Only the two of them knew this secret!

Three years had passed—he’d nearly forgotten. How… how did *he* know?

“Cat got your tongue? Want me to tell you more?” Guan Yu stepped forward aggressively, staring Liu down without yielding an inch.

“N-no… nothing else!” Liu Jili deflated instantly. Shooting a furtive glance at the portly officer nearby, he forced an awkward smile. “Brother Jiang, you… you take him. My stomach’s acting up—must’ve eaten something bad. Gotta use the restroom!”

With that, Liu Jili fled like a whipped dog, all former bravado gone.

“Trash… really thought I’d spare your dignity?” Guan Yu spat contemptuously. If that bastard hadn’t left, he’d have dug up every last secret from his family using his investigative skills!

The chubby officer stared blankly before chuckling, “Not bad… scaring off that hothead. Impressive. Let’s go…”

Guan Yu was led into a cage-like room barred by iron grates. The officer unlocked the door, ushering him inside.

“With those handcuffs, I won’t chain you to the bench. Pee in that bottle if needed. Shout for anything. Once the chief returns from his meeting, we’ll decide whether to transfer you to detention. Trial comes later.” The officer rattled off instructions while locking the door.

Silent, Guan Yu sat on the cold metal bench. His phone had been confiscated during interrogation, cutting off all contact.

Yet he remained unperturbed. However much Park Xu schemed, could he overturn the truth? Gao Wei’s testimony alone proved attempted murder.

Moreover, Director Nie of N City’s Public Security Bureau was a protégé of Old Master Liu. Though not close, they were acquainted—and Guan Yu had once saved the old man’s life. Surely he wouldn’t remain neutral?

As for bribes? His millions in red jade shares with Li Yunshan guaranteed ample funds to resolve this.

While Guan Yu relaxed, Liu Jili—now drenched in sweat back at his desk—couldn’t calm down. That guy was downright eerie!

As he nervously pondered Guan Yu’s threats, commotion erupted outside.

“What’s happening? Who are those people?” the portly officer asked, peering out.

A crew-cut officer shrugged distractedly.

“Luo Cheng! Are you insane?” Feng Xin slammed her car door shut, storming over with icy fury. “Think you can storm the station with this mob to rescue Guan Yu?”

**Chapter 354: Luo Cheng’s Old Classmate**

Seeing Feng Xin, Luo Cheng shrank back, scratching his head sheepishly. “Xin-jie, you’re here…”

Feng Xin scanned Luo Cheng’s entourage—cars lining the street hinted at the Flying Wheels Gang’s recent expansion.

“If numbers alone could free Guan Yu and Niu Le, my Fire Gang outmatches yours tenfold. Disperse them before you provoke the cops into making your lives hell.” She strode past him into the station.

Luo Cheng waved off his men. Lately, his rising influence in West District made him feel unstoppable—a dragon breaking free.

Inside, Feng Xin sought updates on the case. Meanwhile, Zhao Jing’er alerted her grandfather, Old Master Zhao.

After hearing her plea, the patriarch mused, “I’ll have Zhensheng investigate. Don’t panic.” With a life at stake, direct intervention was unwise.

By afternoon, news reached other factions like Boss Liu and retired Director Liu, who soon arrived, swelling the crowd.

“Wait here. I’m going in too.” Luo Cheng adjusted his suit—a far cry from his street thug days—and headed inside.

As he entered, a female officer carrying files paused. “Luo Cheng? Is that you?”

Shao Dan—the campus beauty from his初中—now wore a police uniform.

“Shao Dan?” Luo Cheng blinked. He’d lost touch after dropping out, never imagining she’d joined the force.

“Here on business? Is that your car?” She nodded at the Land Rover.

“Visiting a friend. Say, any news on today’s…” He leaned closer, whispering Guan Yu’s name.

Their chat was interrupted by Liu Jili and the portly officer emerging.

“You causing trouble earlier?” The officer glared at Luo Cheng.

“Shao Dan, you know him?” Liu Jili’s jealousy flared—his crush laughing with another man.

“An old classmate. Problem?” Shao Dan replied coolly.

Liu Jili snorted, sizing up Luo Cheng. “Here for Guan Yu?”

Luo Cheng’s eyes lit up. “You know my brother? How’s his case?”

“*I’m* handling it.” Liu Jili puffed up. “He mouthed off during interrogation, but I shut him down.”

Luo Cheng’s smile vanished. “You? Hurting Guan Yu? Don’t make me laugh.”

“You—” Liu Jili grabbed Luo Cheng’s collar, only to recoil as car doors thudded open.

Dozens of tattooed gangsters emerged, glaring.

Liu Jili paled. Guan Yu’s crew? Since when did N City have this faction?

“Shao Dan, catch up later. I’ve got work.” He retreated hastily.

Giggling, Shao Dan remarked, “Look at you—a proper gang leader now.”

“Heh…” Luo Cheng rubbed his neck.

“Come inside for tea.” She gestured.

As Luo Cheng dismissed his men, Director Nie descended the stairs with Feng Xin, Boss Liu, and Old Master Liu.

“Planning to besiege my station?” Director Nie’s jovial tone held steel.

Luo Cheng hurriedly apologized. “Just worried friends. They’ll leave now.”

Feng Xin shot him a look, and he obediently exited.

**Chapter 355: Learning Restraint**

Luo Cheng understood his place. Today’s tolerance from authority figures stemmed wholly from Guan Yu’s influence. Until truly powerful, prudence was key.

Yet he burned with ambition. With Guan Yu’s rise, even these lofty figures would soon regard *him* differently. His faith in Guan Yu bordered on worship.
