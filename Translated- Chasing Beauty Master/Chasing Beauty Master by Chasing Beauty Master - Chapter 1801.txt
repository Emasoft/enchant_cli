Due to this matter, Xuan Ming spent the entire night without rest, rummaging through numerous ancient texts and references in his study. As Elder Zheng had stated, there indeed existed a renowned immortal artifact called Dragon's Eye Amber, which came in different grades.

Just as Elder Zheng mentioned, the white variety was the most precious, requiring absolute color purity. The cyan grade followed as slightly inferior, with black being the lowest tier. Remarkably, Dragon's Eye Amber formed naturally without requiring refinement, inherently qualifying as an immortal artifact even in its black grade—facts beyond dispute.

Of course, such treasures weren't easily obtained, fueling Xuan Ming's current anxiety. While Cloud Azure Sect possessed immortal artifacts, the Dragon's Eye Amber's rarity surpassed ordinary celestial instruments. Records indicated that even the lowest-grade black amber required ten thousand years to form, with the white grade demanding immeasurably longer evolutionary periods through endless refinement.

Chapter 4711: Hand It Over

This meant the amber could evolve—a process spanning multiple lifetimes even for cultivators. The formation time for pristine white specimens defied estimation. That such a treasure had surfaced in Cloud Azure Sect made Xuan Ming frantic. Were it not for preserving dignity, he would have personally confronted Wang Jun earlier.

Likely no second specimen existed in the entire jianghu. Having this treasure within reach yet unable to verify it would haunt Xuan Ming eternally. Just as he anticipated feasting his eyes and indulging his greed, Guan Yu's possession erected an impassable barrier. Overcoming this obstacle became imperative.

The obstacle being Guan Yu himself. Xuan Ming shot him a glance: "Guan Yu, produce the Dragon's Eye Amber at once. Let your master and fellow elders examine it."

Guan Yu withdrew the amber but withheld it, saying: "Master, Elder Zheng claims this is an immortal artifact. Given my shallow cultivation despite dual martial-magical training, I fear controlling such power. Don't you agree?"

"Precisely," Xuan Ming gravely affirmed. "Your novice status and inexperience risk spiritual backlash or qi deviation." He deliberately exaggerated dangers to deter the youth.

Guan Yu nodded: "Hence this artifact ill-suits me. Yet how should I handle such treasure?"

"Entrust it to my safekeeping," Xuan Ming's eyes gleamed. "Carrying it invites calamity. When you master control, I'll return it." His gaze remained glued to the amber, desire palpable.

"But Master, I'm reluctant to part with such splendor. Who wouldn't cherish bearing it?" Guan Yu feigned hesitation.

Xuan Ming countered: "Foolish! Possession risks death if Demon Soul Sect learns of it. They'll slaughter you for this treasure!"

"Your wisdom enlightens me," Guan Yu bowed. After feigned contemplation, he offered: "Then I shall gift it to you."

"Excellent! Better this than demonic theft. Hand it over!" Xuan Ming's face lit with avarice.

"Yet..." Guan Yu withdrew his extended hand, tormenting the elder. "Perhaps... with a condition."

"What condition?" Xuan Ming's brow furrowed, sensing trickery from this cunning disciple.

Guan Yu declared: "For relinquishing this peerless treasure, Master should demonstrate commensurate sincerity. Fellow elders surely understand this fair exchange."

"You want to barter?" Xuan Ming bluntly retorted.

"Master's discernment shines." Guan Yu smiled.

Xuan Ming grimaced, knowing his possessions paled against the amber's value. Surveying the elders, he sighed: "State your terms."

"Elder Zheng mentioned this ten-millennia artifact's worth. In exchange, I merely request selecting items from Master's collection. Reasonable, no?"

Guan Yu added loudly: "Honored elders—any wishing to trade may present treasures. Suitable offers will be considered."

Wang Jun interjected theatrically: "Master! This evolutionary immortal artifact may be unique! Exchanging your entire collection would prove worthwhile!"

Elder Mu stirred with interest but deferred to Xuan Ming's precedence.

Guan Yu pressed: "Master, the artifact's spirit alone approaches divinity. Its spatial capacity holds infinite spiritual energy—imagine the implications!"

Elder Lu stood abruptly: "If true, our combined possessions couldn't match its value!"

Guan Yu suppressed laughter at Elder Lu's unintended support. Among Cloud Azure elders, only Xuan Ming and Lu possessed notable treasures. Others' combined assets couldn't rival the amber.

"Exactly," Guan Yu smiled, scenting profit. "Whomever trades gains Cloud Azure's advantage. This artifact elevates our sect's standing."

Xuan Ming finally relented. With sweeping sleeves, multicolored radiance erupted—dazzling artifacts materializing around him. "Choose," he coldly offered, though each piece represented decades of accumulation.

To cultivators, these were lifeblood—hoarded like gold by mortals. Only the amber's allure compelled such sacrifice.

Guan Yu and Wang Jun exchanged conspiratorial grins before approaching. Gasps erupted as elders descended to marvel at Xuan Ming's hidden trove.

Noticing familiarity, Guan Yu pointed: "Master, this whip resembles Demon Soul Right Envoy's Soul Devourer." The nine-sectioned weapon bore black gemstones and triple-bladed tip.

Xuan Ming explained: "This is Spirit Devourer—Soul Devourer's twin from century-old conflicts. A Demon Soul Protector wielded it before falling to us."

Guan Yu recalled Right Envoy's four-bladed whip during Miao City clashes. "They differ in gem shapes and blade count. This has three versus Soul Devourer's four."

"I'll take this!" Guan Yu claimed the whip, delighting in Xuan Ming's pained twitch. Though inferior to twelve-sectioned Soul Devourer, its nine segments promised potency.

As Guan Yu examined other artifacts, he beckoned Wang Jun: "Since you retrieved the amber, join the selection."

Xuan Ming's protest died as Guan Yu threatened: "If nothing here satisfies, perhaps other elders..."

"Nonsense! These are all treasures!" Xuan Ming snapped.

Guan Yu turned to the assembly: "Honored elders, display your wares. Perhaps..."

Elder Lu immediately manifested his collection. A radiant bracelet caught Guan Yu's eye—its multicolored orbs shimmering with pride.

"Phoenix Circlet—a rare artifact," Elder Lu proclaimed. "Yours if desired."

The高级 bracelet's arrogant aura suggested an artifact spirit. Its chromatic beads intrigued Guan Yu, who accepted gladly. Other elders withheld meager collections, knowing their inferior offerings.

Chapter 4713: Treasures Galore

Xuan Ming seethed silently, unwilling to explain his artifacts' merits lest Guan Yu claim more. Every piece here ranked at least mid-grade—beneath his dignity to present trash.

Guan Yu casually browsed, lacking expertise to distinguish true value. Xuan Ming's stony silence confirmed the strategy—let the novice choose superficially.

Summoning Wang Jun, Guan Yu announced: "As amber's discoverer, you deserve selection rights."

Xuan Ming's eye twitched at this audacity but choked back protests when Guan Yu threatened abandonment.

Wang Jo approached eagerly. Among glittering arms, a jade hairpin humming with protective energies caught his attention. Testing its weight, he grinned—this would complement his evasion techniques perfectly.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's fingers lingered over an unassuming bronze mirror. Its surface swirled like mercury, occasionally flashing distant landscapes. Recognition dawned—this was the legendary Horizon's Eye, said to scry three hundred li. A surveillance treasure!

"These two," the duo declared simultaneously, holding their chosen prizes.

Xuan Ming's jaw clenched. "You realize each taken item weakens Cloud Azure's defenses?"

Guan Yu smiled innocently: "Yet gaining the amber strengthens us tenfold, no? A worthy trade."

The surrounding elders murmured agreement, covetous eyes still glued to the Dragon's Eye Amber. Xuan Ming knew resistance now would brand him selfish before the assembly.

"Take them," he gritted out. "But remember—this transaction binds you to Cloud Azure's service."

"Of course," Guan Yu bowed, amber already changing hands. As Xuan Ming's trembling fingers closed around the artifact, electric energy surged through the hall—the amber recognizing new ownership.

Wang Jun whispered as they withdrew: "That mirror's the real prize. Why not demand more?"

Guan Yu smirked. "Patience. Let the old man savor false victory. When the amber's... peculiarity manifests, he'll beg us to take it back."

Their laughter echoed down mountain paths, leaving Xuan Ming oblivious to the ticking time bomb in his grasp.
