“I want you to meet a campus belle-level beauty. How does that sound?” Wen Qing blinked her large eyes and chuckled charmingly.

Wen Qing’s smile carried a hint of mischief, making Guan Yu instantly wary. “Then who’s the headache?” he asked.

“The headache is this beauty refusing to cooperate with our work.” Wen Qing tapped the table with her slender fingers, sighing in frustration.

“Work?” Guan Yu looked puzzled.

“The centennial school anniversary! The principal assigned this task to you, but you dumped it all on me without a care. Now you’ve even forgotten about it. Hmph! You’ve got a new wife and forgotten the old one. You don’t care about me at all!” Wen Qing’s teary eyes and resentful gaze left Guan Yu flustered.

Since Guan Yu and Feng Xin crossed the final boundary, the rivalry between Feng Xin and Wen Qing had intensified. As natural adversaries, they often traded barbs, dragging Guan Yu into their crossfire.

Now, even with Feng Xin absent, the battle raged on. Though Guan Yu held the title of student council president, Wen Qing had handled all affairs while he remained a figurehead.

Guan Yu smiled awkwardly and changed the subject. “It’s just a school anniversary. Handle it casually. If someone refuses, find a replacement.”

“Hmph! Easier said than done.” Wen Qing pouted. “Darling, this is our school’s centennial! The administration wants it to be meaningful. We can’t be careless.”

“Fine,” Guan Yu conceded. “What’s the connection between this student and our work? Is she irreplaceable?”

Wen Qing nodded solemnly. “For the centennial, we have three major plans: a cultural corridor showcasing our history, a commemorative gift reflecting our artistic heritage, and a grand talent show. As an arts academy, the show is crucial. Alumni stars will perform, including Gao Wei. You’ll see her again.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Why would she refuse such an opportunity?”

“I asked her directly, but she wouldn’t explain. That’s why I need you,” Wen Qing pleaded.

Guan Yu sighed. “You think I’m omnipotent? If she refuses, we can’t force her. Find someone else.”

Wen Qing shook her head. “She’s exceptional—the administration believes she could become the next Gao Wei. Without her, our show loses its luster.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “That highly regarded?”

“But if she won’t perform, her talent is wasted.” Wen Qing batted her lashes. “Maybe charm her into your harem! With her, you’d have four campus belles. Imagine the envy!”

“Four?” Guan Yu smirked.

“You’re the campus heartthrob. Four flowers to your one grass—quite the fantasy.” Wen Qing winked seductively.

Guan Yu swallowed hard. “What’s her name?”

“Wen Ya.”

**Chapter 754: The Problem Emerges**

Drunk from Wang Zhen’s relentless toasts, Guan Yu stumbled to the restroom. Returning, he witnessed Ji Chengfeng’s harassment of Wen Ya. Despite past friction, he intervened.

“We meet again,” Guan Yu remarked dryly.

“Yes,” Wen Ya hissed. “Our score isn’t settled.”

“Then handle this yourself.” Guan宇 turned coldly.

“Wait!” Wen Ya panicked, trailing him.

“Leaving after maiming someone?” Lu Yi blocked their path. “You’ll pay with a leg.”

“Try it,” Guan Yu sneered.

Ji Chengfeng screamed for “Monkey,” the bar’s enforcer. Moments later, Monkey arrived with thugs.

“Trash this guy!” Ji Chengfeng demanded.

Monkey lunged, but Guan宇 dismantled them effortlessly. Ji Cheng峰’s threats crumbled as Guan宇冷眼睥睨.

“You’re fired,” Guan宇 declared.

**Chapter 753: You Again?**

“Slut! Play hard-to-get?” Ji Chengfeng grabbed Wen Ya.

Slap!

“Bitch!” Ji Chengfeng roared, flinging her down.

Defiant, Wen Ya glared. Ji Chengfeng lunged, but a hand seized his collar.

“Enough.” Guan宇’s voice cut like ice.
