At this moment, Guan Yu was at Xuanzhong Peak, the liveliest place in the Yunqing Sect, which naturally drew his presence.

Amidst the cheerful banter, Guan Yu patted Xiao Zhi's shoulder and remarked, "Starting tomorrow, you'll be a married man. Don't you feel like you've suddenly grown up?"

"Guan Yu, you're teasing me again," Xiao Zhi feigned complaint. "This good fortune is all thanks to you! Hahaha! I originally wanted to enjoy my carefree days a few more years."

Aze chimed in nearby, "You're truly shameless. Without Guan Yu, would you have met such an excellent girl as Du Bingyan? Now that you've gained such a bargain, you still pretend to complain. Honestly, you look like you're asking for a beating."

"Speaking of which, Aze," Xiao Zhi chuckled, "why don't you travel with Guan Yu sometime? He might help you find a match too. Then you can settle down—you're not getting any younger either."

Aze showed no embarrassment, actually considering this a splendid idea. "I agree! With luck, perhaps I'll find a martial arts prodigy for a wife. She could even become my protector in the future! Hahaha!"

As the group chatted merrily, a contingent arrived at Xuanzhong Peak—Elder Dai leading disciples from Juhe Peak.

Upon hearing the news, Elder Zheng hurried out personally, unusually beaming as he greeted, "Junior Sister Dai, you've worked hard."

"Senior Brother flatters me," Elder Dai replied. "Since Juhe Peak is the only division in Yunqing Sect with female disciples, it's only proper for us to care for the bride-to-be. How could I refuse such a reasonable request?"

It turned out Elder Dai's arrival with female disciples had been Elder Zheng's petition, at Luo Jie's suggestion. As Du Bingyan needed assistance with bridal preparations—dressing and makeup—Elder Dai had brought skilled attendants.

Guan Yu and others approached to pay respects. Spotting Siqi standing behind Elder Dai, Guan Yu felt delighted she had come.

Elder Dai glanced at Guan Yu and teased, "Look at Xiao Zhi—usually such a well-behaved lad, yet he's already brought home a wife before any of you older bachelors. You all should hurry up!"

This remark made Siqi blush nervously. She wondered when her own wedding day with Guan Yu might arrive—the thought of him arriving at Juhe Peak with a grand procession to marry her filled her with quiet excitement.

"Elder Dai," Guan Yu blurted without thinking, "you're not exactly young either—" He abruptly stopped mid-sentence, realizing his blunder. The words hung irrevocably in the air.

Guan Yu's heart sank. As expected, Elder Dai flicked her wrist, summoning a lightning bolt that crackled above his head. He barely dodged backward, narrowly escaping electrocution. The group gasped at Elder Dai's sudden attack.

Chapter 4728: Wishful Thinking

Quickly recovering, Guan Yu laughed apologetically, "This disciple spoke out of turn! On this joyous occasion, I beg Elder Dai's forgiveness. In fact, I prepared a small gift for you."

Producing a jade pendant from somewhere—a luxurious accessory typically worn at the waist by the wealthy—he presented the unadorned green jade piece. Though its origins were unknown, it had been taken from the Swordless Villa.

Elder Dai, having only intended a minor lesson, promptly accepted the valuable-looking gift. "Since you have plenty of treasures, I'll reluctantly accept this."

"Thank you for your magnanimity, Elder Aunt." Guan Yu bowed with an ingratiating smile.

"Humph! You reckless brat," Elder Dai scowled half-heartedly. "Were it not for this timely offering, I'd have charred you to cinders!"

Others wiped nervous sweat. Elder Zheng interjected smoothly, "Junior Sister, let's overlook the disciple's slip of tongue. Please, come inside."

As Elder Dai led the way, Siqi pinched Guan Yu's arm when passing. Seizing the moment, he kissed her cheek when others weren't looking, making her shyly dart away.

Aze approached muttering, "You've got guts saying such things. Even the Sect Leader wouldn't dare!"

"It was a thoughtless slip! Cost me a treasure too—how unfair." Guan Yu grimaced.

Wang Jun inquired, "Are Elder Dai's attendants here to assist the bride? Are they competent?"

"Competent or not, you could join me at Hushou Peak tonight," Guan Yu suggested slyly. "The Juhe disciples and Du Bingyan will stay there. A rare chance for... conversation."

Juhe female disciples never resided at Hushou Peak except during sect affairs, confined to specific courtyards. This was indeed an exceptional opportunity.

Aze immediately declared, "I'll go too! I'll join the bride's entourage!"

Xiao Zhi overheard and scoffed, "You dog! Abandoning years of brotherhood for female company? Have you no shame?"

"Why can't I if Guan Yu does?" Aze retorted.

"Absolutely not!" Xiao Zhi commanded. "With everyone at Hushou Peak, who'll manage Xuanzhong? Stay here—plenty needs doing. Dream on about leaving!"

At Hushou Peak, Xuangming had prepared a bridal chamber for Du Bingyan. The Juhe disciples would accompany her出嫁, with Guan Yu—as Du's close friend—naturally included. Aze's desire to join however raised eyebrows.

Tomorrow's Xuanzhong Peak would host Yunqing Sect's grandest celebration in years. Though overwhelmed with preparations—lanterns and decorations everywhere—the disciples managed through early preparations. Luo Jie bustled tirelessly, overjoyed for her son's wedding.

Elder Zheng thanked Elder Dai in the main hall: "Junior Sister, we're grateful. Otherwise we'd need outsiders for bridal preparations."

"Senior Brother is too kind," Elder Dai replied. "The Sect Leader approved holding a folk-style wedding—familiar and festive for all. Siqi will lead the attendants to prepare the bride timely."

Indeed, this unprecedented celebration brought rare joy to Yunqing Sect. Elder Zheng had even invited rear mountain elders, though their attendance remained uncertain.

By evening, Guan Yu received the enviable task of escorting Juhe disciples and Du Bingyan to Hushou Peak—a duty that left other Xuanzhong disciples green with envy.

Chapter 4729: Conserving Energy

Leading the procession of Juhe disciples including Siqi and Du Bingyan, Guan Yu deliberately walked instead of flying. Wang Jun accompanied them, indifferent to wedding preparations beyond showing up tomorrow.

Guan Yu turned to ask, "Sister-in-law, is your chamber at Hushou Peak ready? Surely not my old room? I can request better quarters if needed."

"Thank you, but Sect Leader Xuangming prepared a grand front courtyard room," Du Bingyan smiled.

Nodding, Guan Yu teased, "Excited for tomorrow? Doubt you'll sleep tonight!"

"Not at all," she retorted playfully. "I need to conserve energy properly."

Wang Jun interjected, "Guan Yu, even Xiao Zhi's getting married. What about you and Siqi?"

Guan Yu shot him a glare, but Du Bingyan added, "Exactly! You two are perfect—talented and beautiful. When will you wed?"

Other disciples joined the chorus, nudging Siqi who blushed furiously. Guan Yu deflected, "Why the rush? At least we're paired. You singles should worry about yourselves!"

Disciple Xiao Lian joked, "Find us husbands matching your standards then!"

"Find me someone like you, Guan Yu, and I'll agree!" Another disciple, Xiao Chun, added.

Guan Yu laughed boastfully, "Dream on! The Jianghu lacks another as handsome, capable, and wealthy as I!"

The group erupted in laughter. Xiao Lian tugged Siqi, "Your man's so arrogant! Admit it—he's terribly conceited."

"Yet you still adore him," Xiao Chun teased. Siqi could only smile, secretly agreeing while defending, "Don't mind him—he jokes."

"Then yield him to us!" Xiao Lian pressed. "If you're unsatisfied, we'll take him!"

Chapter 4730: Mere Jest

Xiao Chun joined, "Yes! If Guan Yu displeases you, let us have him!"

Amidst laughter, Guan Yu sighed internally. His diversion tactic had backfired spectacularly.

Xiao Lian continued, "We're not as pretty as Siqi. Who'd want us?"

"Lower your standards then," Guan Yu advised. "Wait too long and wrinkles will leave you unwed!"

"Then find us husbands like yourself!" they chorused.

Guan Yu shook his head theatrically. "Impossible! The Jianghu holds none equal to this peerless gentleman!"

As laughter echoed, Xiao Lian whispered to Siqi, "He's utterly shameless!" Yet even as she complained, her eyes betrayed admiration for the confident figure ahead.
