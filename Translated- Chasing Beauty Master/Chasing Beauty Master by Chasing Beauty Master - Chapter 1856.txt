“Father, I believe it must be true. The Duan family's financial foundation and influence are extraordinary – this you must know well. When we previously sought collaboration with them, they refused. Now they have no reason to approach us under false pretenses.” Tang Muchen continued, “Duan Ruxue’s words carry high credibility. With the Cao family severely weakened and the perpetrator unknown, suspicion naturally falls upon our Tang and Duan families. Under such circumstances, it would be perfectly logical for the Cao family to secretly ally with the Qin family.”

Old Master Tang lowered his head in contemplation. Though the veracity of the Cao-Qin alliance remained unconfirmed, Tang Muchen’s reasoning held merit. The Duan family had always maintained strict neutrality, never engaging with any faction. Their sudden proposal for a covert alliance was indeed perplexing. As Muchen rightly noted – when we previously sought business collaboration, they refused; without significant developments, they’d have no reason to initiate an alliance now.

In truth, Tang Muchen’s motivations were twofold: half genuine concern for alliance, half personal interest in deepening his relationship with Duan Ruxue. “Regardless of the Cao-Qin situation,” he pressed, “a secret alliance with the Duan family positions us advantageously. We’ll hold the initiative in any confrontation and risk nothing. I see no downside.”

“Matters aren’t so simple,” the elder Tang countered. “While beneficial, this violates imperial decree. Should evidence surface and reach the Emperor’s ears, our house faces catastrophe.” His voice betrayed lingering unease.

“If it comes to that, the Duan family shares our risk,” Muchen argued. “The Emperor would punish them as initiators. This is precautionary – if Cao and Qin conspire in shadows while we remain ignorant, we’ll suffer greatly. The Cao’s ambition to devour our family is no secret.”

“Arrogant fools!” The old master snorted. “My house, built over generations, won’t be swallowed by Cao’s wishful thinking!”

“But should Cao-Qin unite in secret while we lack allies...” Muchen’s voice tightened. “With Duan as our hidden bulwark, even if they strike, we retain support. Secrecy maintained, this alliance brings only benefit.”

Their discussion was interrupted by a young woman bearing tea – the seventh Madame Tang, a recent addition to the household barely older than Muchen himself. Though sixty this year, the old master had married this distant minor clan’s daughter last year, originally intended for his son. Finding her way to the patriarch’s chambers through circumstance, she’d blossomed under his care, now radiating beauty as she served refreshments.

“My lords should refresh yourselves,” she chimed, placing cups before them. “You’ve spoken hours without drink.”

Such interruptions were strictly forbidden during councils, but the old master indulged his favorite concubine. As she poured, she added casually, “Have you heard the news from Wan Yang Tavern? Young Master Qu Hua of Qin made advances on two women – only to discover they belonged to that Wan Hong fellow. Thirty Qin guards lay beaten in the streets by Wan Hong alone! He declared the Qin house worthless, awaiting their challenge!”

Old Master Tang’s teacup paused mid-air. “This Wan Hong – what game does he play?” Muchen confirmed the account, adding details of Wan Hong’s earlier presence with Lady Jiang.

The discussion turned strategic. “This hothead has now offended both Cao and Qin,” mused the patriarch. “Enemy of our enemies could prove useful.” Muchen nodded, planning outreach.

Meanwhile at Cao Manor, news of the tavern incident prompted Lord Cao’s grim smile. “Let Qin deal with this audacious fool,” he ordered preparations to visit Qin allies.

Duan Ruxue, secluded in her chambers after meeting Guan Yu (Wan Hong’s alias), found her composure shaken despite lifelong discipline. A maid’s gossip about the tavern brawl reignited her thoughts – Wan Hong’s effortless defeat of thirty guards brought unexpected reassurance.

At Qin Manor, chaos reigned. Madame Qin stormed past physicians attending her nephew Qu Hua’s groin injury. “Who dares endanger our lineage?” she shrieked. The family doctor cautioned uncertain prognosis, fueling her fury.

“That beast Wan Hong!” Qu Hua whimpered, embellishing his account to implicate family honor. “He mocks the Qin name!”

Madame Qin’s wrath met cooler reception from Lord Qin, recently returned from business travels. “Fool boy provoked conflict chasing skirts,” he sighed, ordering investigations into Wan Hong’s connections to the Imperial Son-in-Law.

As tempers flared across noble houses, Wan Hong’s shadow loomed larger – an unpredictable spark threatening to ignite the tinderbox of imperial politics.
