Guan Yu indeed harbored such thoughts. Considering his uncle and aunt's amiable nature, he believed Qin Taijin couldn't be too bad either. Perhaps they could truly become friends. Moreover, while his uncle remained perpetually busy, Qin Taijin enjoyed considerable leisure. This idleness might prove advantageous for their current mission, given his familiarity with local affairs.

Reflecting further, Guan Yu reasoned that since the City Lord's Manor and Crimson Lotus Sect had become sworn enemies, Young Master Men would naturally oppose the sect. The Manor would never permit Crimson Lotus to establish footing in Qujiang City. Leveraging this animosity to foster better relations with Young Master Men could prove strategically wise. In time, they might utilize the Manor's forces against Crimson Lotus.

The Crimson Lotus Sect remained a dangerous obstacle. Yue Jing and Lai Lixia's deplorable conduct left Guan Yu convinced their sectmates couldn't be much better. Even their leader, Sun Lianzi—that old schemer—likely shared their treacherous nature. Why else would he cultivate such cunning disciples and dispatch them on missions?

The Eight-Sided Drum Manual's emergence at Duobao Mountain represented a critical event, inevitably bringing conflict with Demonic Sect forces. Though Guan Yu held no illusions about orthodox sects' hypocrisy—their willingness to sacrifice principles for gain—they at least refrained from widespread atrocities. The Demonic Sect's ruthlessness, however, brought suffering to common folk. Preventing their acquisition of the manual became paramount.

Regarding Qin Taijin's potential assistance, Guan Yu resolved to assess the man's character personally. If proven honorable, friendship might blossom. If not, mere utilization would suffice.

Xiao Zhi proposed, "After supper, let's explore the city. We've accomplished nothing these past days—this idleness suffocates me."

"Shouldn't we focus on our mission?" Aze worried. "Our sect entrusted us with responsibilities. Lingering here in comfort feels improper."

"Have you better ideas?" Guan Yu countered calmly. "Duobao Mountain reveals no clues despite countless searchers. Would you be the sacrificial lamb? Any discovery now would merely serve others."

"Our strategy must be patience. Let others exhaust themselves seeking Meng Hua Ancestor's ruins. The first finder won't necessarily claim the manual. Haste serves no purpose."

Relieved by this logic, Aze embraced their leisurely routine—feasting, sleeping, carefree existence. Xiao Zhi, however, chafed at inactivity. "Will you two join me or not? Your tolerance for boredom astounds me!"

Guan Yu considered. Siqi remained safe at his uncle's residence, protected by both security and her own cultivation. "Very well. A stroll might prove diverting."

Delighted, Xiao Zhi grinned. "Excellent! Such a grand city deserves exploration while we await developments."

As they departed, Guan Yu recalled, "Doesn't Qin Taijin return tonight? Our absence seems discourteous."

"Tomorrow suffices for introductions," Xiao Zhi began, then froze mid-sentence. Following his gaze, Guan Yu suppressed the urge to flee—Wang Xiaorong stood ahead.

"Fate's irony!" Guan Yu lamented silently. "Must our paths perpetually cross in this vast city?"

Xiao Zhi's plans crumbled. He'd hoped to visit Echo Pavilion, where the courtesan Cui Hua awaited. Though Guan Yu had previously reserved her services to shield her from Young Master Men's advances, Xiao Zhi nurtured growing affection for the demure entertainer.

Wang Xiaorong approached brightly. "Guan Yu! I recognized you instantly!"

Aze interposed coldly. "Demonic Sect witch! Cease harassing our brother. Our paths diverge—keep your distance."

"Am I some ravening beast?" she retorted, hurt evident. "Guan Yu, must you hide behind others? You know I mean no harm."

"Though you aided us before," Aze conceded grudgingly, "your sect's nature remains vile."

"Fool!" Wang Xiaorong snapped. "All know Blackblood Ridge operates independently from Demonic Soul Sect! I helped rescue your friend—is this how orthodox dogs repay kindness?"

Bystanders gathered, drawn by the commotion. Guan Yu intervened gently. "Aze, remember her assistance. Even across faction lines, gratitude remains paramount. Would you have us mirror their discourtesy?"

Chastened, Aze retreated. Xiao Zhi seized the opportunity. "I just recalled urgent business! Enjoy your... discussion." He fled with Aze in tow, abandoning Guan Yu.

Left alone, Guan Yu weighed caution against courtesy. Without Zijinlang's protection, recklessness invited danger. Yet Wang Xiaorong's earnest gaze disarmed him.

"You seem apprehensive," she teased. "Do I terrify you so?"

"Only if you plan to devour me," he deflected.

Her eyes sparkled. "Perhaps I might... in more pleasant ways."

Guan Yu redirected firmly. "Your purpose here? Another invitation from your father? My answer remains unchanged."

"Actually," she confessed, "I'd rather you avoided him. Your current opposition makes meeting... unwise."

"Then why—"

"Because!" Her cheeks flushed. "Eventually you'll meet your father-in-law, won't you?"

Guan Yu recoiled. "Such improper talk! Have you no modesty?"

"Modesty?" She lifted her chin defiantly. "I cast aside pride for you! Lines of suitors await me, yet I choose an oblivious fool. Tell me—are you truly a man? Prove it!"

"Your taunts won't sway me," he countered. "Our factions make this impossible. Accept reality."

"I reject your 'reality'!" Passion ignited her words. "We could flee—build new lives where none know us! The Jade Lake Sect, distant islands... anywhere!"

Guan Yu sighed. "Your father would hunt us. My sect would brand me traitor. Even if you joined Yunqing, elders would suspect espionage. Master Xuanming might imprison you as leverage."

Undeterred, she pressed. "What binds you to them? They reclaimed your artifacts! Countless Demonic spies infiltrate orthodox sects—hypocrites all!"

"The Yunqing Sect is my home," he stated solemnly. "Betrayal makes me no better than those you describe. I'll die before forsaking them."

Their standoff lingered, charged with unspoken yearnings and implacable divides. Around them, the city's bustle continued, oblivious to the crossroads unfolding between sect heir and demon princess.
