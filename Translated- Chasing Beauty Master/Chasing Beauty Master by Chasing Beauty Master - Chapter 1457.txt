“To say she wasn’t worried would be a lie. It was only natural for her to come here to plead for her son. Luo Jie appeared to be a remarkably youthful mother, her appearance well-preserved despite years of marriage.

Elder Lu strode forward and waved his hand. Wang Jun spoke up proactively, “Uncle Lu, this matter is beyond my authority. Since you’ve arrived, I’ll entrust it to you.”

“Hmm. You may go. Leave this to me,” Elder Lu had barely finished speaking when Luo Jie interjected urgently, “Brother Lu, I’ve never begged anyone in my life. Today, I implore you—help Xiaozhi. He’s still just a child.”

Elder Lu fully understood Luo Jie’s anguish. Over the years, both Elder Zheng and Luo Jie had rendered immense service to the Cloud Azure Sect. As for Xiaozhi truly being a spy for the Demonic Sect? Elder Lu refused to believe it.

Moreover, Xiaozhi’s predicament had cast shadows over Elder Zheng and Luo Jie’s standing. Yet Elder Lu remained steadfast in his conviction: this couple harbored no ill intent. Having lived within the Cloud Azure Sect for decades—some even centuries—one’s character became transparent over time. They had no conceivable motive to align with the Demonic Sect.

This, Elder Lu believed wholeheartedly. “Sister Luo, calm yourself. Let us speak privately.”

The two retreated to a pavilion atop Bamboo Peak. Though seated, Luo Jie’s agitation lingered. “Brother Lu, I must know—how is Xiaozhi faring now?”

**Chapter 3797: Covert Investigation**

“Truth be told, the boy’s condition is grave. But do not despair. The Sect Leader and I were just devising a plan to aid him.”

“The Sect Leader intends to execute Xiaozhi! I must plead with him personally. Brother Lu, you must help! You know Xiaozhi isn’t a spy. He’s been obedient since childhood—someone must have framed him!” Luo Jie’s voice trembled with emotion.

“Of course I believe you,” Elder Lu replied. “I watched that boy grow. His nature is clear to me. Yet facts remain: traces of demonic arts were found on him, and he wounded Yan Zhao at Tiger Peak before all witnesses, still covered in bestial fur. Our arguments hold no sway. Even my faith in you changes nothing. But take heart—I’ve persuaded the Sect Leader to postpone judgment. Our priority now is alleviating Xiaozhi’s torment. Perhaps Elder Zheng struck too harshly earlier, leaving the boy unconscious.”

“What? Is Xiaozhi in mortal danger? May I beg the Sect Leader to let me see him? At least allow me to tend his wounds!” Though relieved at the stay of execution, Luo Jie fretted over her son’s injuries.

“Impossible. You know full well this incident has eroded trust in your family. Many disciples whisper that you orchestrated this or are Demonic spies yourselves. For now, you and Elder Zheng must remain secluded until tensions ease. Xiaozhi’s safety rests with me—I swear to spare no effort in his defense.”

Elder Lu’s words brought Luo Jie a measure of calm. Though anxiety lingered, she recognized the wisdom in his counsel. Overzealous pleading might worsen their precarious position.

“Very well. We entrust Xiaozhi to you, Brother Lu. Inform us immediately of any developments.”

**Chapter 3798: Collusion**

Elder Lu nodded. “Set your mind at ease. I regard Xiaozhi as my own flesh and blood. But remind Elder Zheng—this reeks of sabotage. He should investigate discreetly. Clues may surface.”

Somewhat pacified by the assurance of her son’s temporary safety, Luo Jie rose. “I’ll convey your message. I take my leave now.”

As Luo Jie departed, Elder Lu’s gaze turned contemplative. Recent events bore the stench of manipulation. The Cloud Azure Sect’s peace fractured—a storm brewed across the martial world.

Returning to Xiaozhi’s cell, Elder Lu found two guards—including Wang Jun, who’d escorted him earlier. “Uncle Lu, the Sect Leader and masters have departed. Do you require anything?”

Gesturing inward, Elder Lu declared, “The Sect Leader granted me permission to treat Xiaozhi. I enter now.”

“By all means. His orders were explicit—none but you may pass.” Wang Jun stepped aside with a bow.

Approving the disciple’s diligence, Elder Lu entered. Xiaozhi lay motionless as before. Upon examination, the youth’s blood raced at twice normal pace, his heart pounding furiously. Strange energies clashed within him—yet what caused this monstrous transformation?

Setting aside speculation, Elder Lu focused on stabilization. Seating Xiaozhi upright, he channeled formidable spiritual power to quell the chaotic energies. Perhaps order would restore the boy’s form.

News of the Cloud Azure disciple’s beast-transformation spread like wildfire, dominating martial gossip. The sect’s prestige wavered as critics decried declining prowess. Detractors claimed their glory days under previous leadership had passed, now reduced to impotence against Demonic encroachment.

Opportunistic sects seized the moment to slander Cloud Azure—questioning their legacy techniques, mocking their disciples’ mediocrity. All sought to poach talent and elevate their own status.

Yet Cloud Azure’s millennia-old foundations held. Loyalists organized counter-campaigns, suppressing rumors while petitioning for admission—hoping to prove devotion.

Unbeknownst to them, the sect remained consumed by internal purge, hunting traitors while barring new recruits lest Demonic spies infiltrate.

**Chapter 3799: Reckoning**

After Elder Lu expended decades’ worth of spiritual energy, Xiaozhi finally awoke at dawn. The youth blinked in confusion at his unfamiliar cell.

“Where am I?” he muttered, noting his soiled garments and fetid stench. Memories surfaced—the abnormality at Tiger Peak, his body betraying him—then darkness.

Rattling the iron-barred door, he called hoarsely, “Is anyone there? What is this place?”

The dozing guards started. “Xiaozhi’s awake!”

Peering through the door’s grate, Xiaozhi recognized Bamboo Peak disciples. “Why am I imprisoned? What crime have I committed?”

“Play innocent?” sneered one guard. “Colluding with the Demonic Sect, attacking fellow disciples with their sorcery—even your father’s rank couldn’t save you. He’s been stripped of position and confined!”

“Lies! When did I ever—”

“Elder Lu begged on his knees to spare you,” the other interrupted. “He spent decades of cultivation to revive you. Show some gratitude and rot quietly here.”

Xiaozhi’s mind reeled. Fragmented memories of black fur sprouting from his skin... “What’s happened to me? Why...?”

“Save your breath. Think on keeping your head.” The grate slammed shut.

Desperation clawed at Xiaozhi. Once revered, now even junior disciples scorned him. “I must see the Sect Leader! I’m innocent!”

“The Sect Leader wants you dead. Be grateful you’re breathing.”

In Tiger Peak’s main hall, Sect Leader Xuan Ming scrutinized scrolls listing every sect member—down to livestock. “Elder Lu,” he addressed, “your precinct’s tally appears meticulous. Others should emulate your thoroughness. From tomorrow, any unlisted individuals cease to be Cloud Azure disciples.”

As others dispersed, only Xuan Ming, Elder Lu, and head disciple Yan Zhao remained. “Speak,” Xuan Ming commanded, noting Yan Zhao’s hesitation.

“Master,” Yan Zhao began, shooting Elder Lu a wary glance, “when will Xiaozhi face judgment? The disciples grow restless. They demand execution for his collusion.”

Elder Lu interjected coldly, “The Sect Leader will decide in due course. All will receive justice.”

Xuan Ming’s silence echoed louder than words. The storm clouds gathered.
