“Oh, so you finally remember me at this time. If I didn’t want to help you, I wouldn’t be wasting so many words here. Also, there’s one more thing you must know.”

“What? Speak!”

“Do you know where those werewolves came from?”

Bard shook his head. “No. But decades ago, our Barren Town suffered attacks from mysterious beasts. Many died over the years, most of them…”

He paused abruptly. Guan Yu continued his sentence, “Most were people connected to the town mayor. Am I right?”

Bard’s face paled with shock, his words stumbling. “H-how... did you know?”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “So the rumors are true. In that case, I’ll explain the werewolves’ origins. Have you heard of the great war between humans and elves fifty years ago?”

Bard nodded. “Of course. If not for that war, Barren Town wouldn’t have fallen to this state. Decades ago, this place was prosperous—a hub for human-elf trade. But after the war, it became a battlefield. Tens of thousands died. Many were buried in horsehide shrouds, perishing on the sands. Survivors became homeless, dying wretchedly in the wilderness.”

**Chapter 1413: The Villa**

“The reason I sought you out is to use your authority as mayor to inform Barren Town’s villagers. Let them know there’s no need to panic if werewolves come. I’ll find a way to help them.”

“You?” Bard’s disbelief was evident, his cowardice laid bare—he’d sooner flee than confront werewolves.

“Don’t believe me? Shall I use you as a test subject to demonstrate my capabilities?”

At the mention of experimentation, Bard shook his head frantically. After today’s ordeal, his life hung by a thread—another trial would finish him.

In truth, Guan Yu had no intention of experimenting. The threat was merely a scare tactic. Noting Bard’s swift compliance, he sneered, “How resolute! Now, how do we alert everyone quickly?”

“Simple!” Bard strode confidently behind the iron gate. Beneath the red button lay a yellow one. “A single press summons the entire town.”

His finger descended. After a second’s silence, rapid beeping echoed. A multicolored beam shot skyward from the mansion’s roof.

*Crack!*

Guan Yu stared, dumbfounded. *An air raid siren? I underestimated this world’s technology.*

Bard preened at Guan Yu’s surprise—this alarm system was his proud design. “Well, Young Master Guan Yu? How’s this invention?”

Seeing Bard’s smugness, Guan Yu refrained from criticism. “Not bad. Far more reliable than your usual antics.”

Though slighted, Bard clung to the faint praise like a child validated by a teacher.

“Is this truly effective? Why is it still so quiet?” Guan Yu questioned after minutes of silence.

Bard thumped his chest. “Patience, young master! Most villagers are elderly—slowness is expected!”

Guan Yu shot him a sidelong glance, temporarily conceding.

Yet minutes later, the town remained still—no humans, not even dogs. Suspicion resurged.

“What’s happening? This never occurred before!”

Soon, a trickle of villagers emerged. As Bard said, they were mostly frail elders—likely to perish soon regardless of werewolves.

“Mayor Bard, why summon us at dawn?” croaked an old man.

“Haven’t used this alarm in ages. Drunk again?”

“Must’ve mistaken it while harassing some lass!”

Guan Yu marveled inwardly: *These elders are roasting experts!*

As the crowd swelled, Bard led them to a square. All eyes fixated on Guan Yu.

“Young Master, why are they staring?” Liu Yishou whispered.

Guan Yu sighed. “Obvious, no? You’d attract stares too with a cat on your head.”

Only then did Liu notice the feline perched atop Guan Yu.

“Bika Cat, three seconds to get down—or tonight’s menu features roasted cat!”

Normally, the threat would send Bika fleeing. Now it stammered, “E-even as roasted kitten... I won’t!”

Sensing unease, Guan Yu scanned the crowd. “What’s wrong? See something?”

After a pause, Bika mumbled, “...A mouse.”

Guan Yu nearly choked. Seizing the cat’s tail, he flung it down. “Disgrace of felines!”

The chastised cat slunk back, mewling pitifully.

Half an hour later, the crowd assembled—over a thousand souls.

“Silence!” Bard bellowed. “I’ve gathered you for an announcement!”

“What now? More ‘protection fees’? This crone has no coin, only bones!”

“Aye, no money!” The mob erupted.

Bard flushed, raising his hands. “Enough! Disrupt again, and fees double this year!”

“By what right? Tyrant!”

Amidst outcries, Guan Yu frowned. Unfamiliar with this world’s laws, he hesitated to intervene—yet balance was already tipping.

Beside him, Liu Yishou sighed. “Fee time approaches. What misery!”

“When’s the deadline?” Guan Yu asked.

**Chapter 1414: Protection Fees?**

“A month hence.”

“How much?”

“Twenty gold last year—twenty-five now.”

Guan Yu pressed, “They increase yearly?”

“For five-six years. Started at five gold.”

Twenty gold meant months of starvation for families like Liu’s—crafting trinkets for meager earnings. Worse, the hike compounded their plight. Though Guan Yu possessed ten thousand gold from Wei Buqun’s loot, aiding all was impossible. The solution lay upstream.

“Which jurisdiction governs Barren Town?”

“Border of Yongzhou City, within the Moonworship Empire.”

“Moonworship Empire?” The name resonated, but Guan Yu focused. “Are fees empire-wide?”

“No! Only here!”

Realization struck—Bard was a local despot bleeding his people dry. No longer bound by “world rules,” Guan Yu glared. “Impressive work.”

Bard shrank into the crowd, but Guan Yu signaled Bika Cat. The feline pounced onto his neck.

“Move, and hear your neck snap.”

Cowed by prior encounters, Bard froze.

“You promised to deal with werewolves!” he squeaked.

Bika sneered, “Werewolves we’ll handle—but you’re the bloodsucking leech! Look at this poverty! Squeezing people’s marrow—what conscience remains?”

“The fees fund the guard corps! Their upkeep costs dearly!”

Guan Yu strode over. “Ah yes, your ‘guards’—protecting villagers? Or yourself?”

Bard withered under their glares. After strained silence, he pleaded, “Focus on the werewolves! We’ll discuss fees later!”

“Later?” Guan Yu scoffed.

“The werewolves threaten our existence!”

“Now you care? Your extortion’s the greater evil. Today, you answer to all!”

The crowd roared agreement: “Account for this!”

“Silence! Double fees for troublemakers!” Bard threatened.

But the dam had broken. Villagers surged forward:

“Young Master, help us!”

“Eighty years old! Twenty gold yearly—where to find it?”

“Ninety and ailing—still paying!”

The square boiled with grievances. Guan Yu turned to Bard. “See? This isn’t my grievance alone. Years of fees—how much did you pocket?”

“All spent on training!”

“Training?” Guan Yu gestured at the opulent mansion. “And this villa? Sprouted from the earth?”

Bard gaped, speechless.

A villager shouted, “We tolerated your tyranny for peace post-cataclysm! But push further, and we revolt!”

The mob chanted: “No more fees! Down with Bard!”

“You... you ingrates!” Bard spluttered.

Guan Yu raised his hand. “People! Another urgent matter requires attention!”

**Chapter 1415: Crossing the Line**

The crowd stilled—Guan Yu now held their trust. Bard seethed helplessly.

“What farce is this?” Bard hissed. “Helping or ruining me?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Flattering yourself. This isn’t about you—only justice.”

“Then announce your ‘urgent matter’!”

“Quiet and listen!”

Guan Yu addressed the crowd: “Everyone, today’s gathering concerns more than fees—”

“Not fees? Then why mention them? Teasing us?”

“No backbone! Don’t play saint!”

“Waste of time! Disperse!”

As grumbles resumed, the crowd scattered. Guan Yu stood baffled. *What shortsighted fools! Not one visionary among a thousand?*
