Guan Yu rolled his eyes in exasperation. “Do I look like a swindler to you?” he asked pointedly.

The young man continued staring at Guan Yu with a troubled expression. “Real con artists never look like con artists,” he replied honestly. “I was tricked by a girl before, which is how I ended up in this mess.”

Jinhua giggled. “Maybe you fancied her and let your guard down? Seems you’re quite the lusty lad!”

“What man isn’t?” the youth retorted bluntly, his sweeping statement implicating all males under heaven—an assertion none dared contradict.

“Given your current predicament,” Guan Yu reasoned, “what motive would I have to deceive you? If I wished you harm, I’d simply call the police instead of wasting breath here.” Though genuinely wanting to help, he secretly admired the boy’s wariness—proof of sharp instincts.

After pondering, the youth found logic in Guan Yu’s words. Hope of returning to China rekindled, he scrambled up despite his injuries and knelt to kowtow.

Guan Yu swiftly pulled him upright. “A man’s knees bear gold,” he admonished sternly. “We kneel only to heaven, earth, and parents. Never surrender your dignity.”

Steadying the youth, Guan Yu continued, “I want you as a sworn brother, not a servant. Will you accept this bond?”

“Yes! Yes!” the young man stammered urgently. As Guan Yu grasped his hand, a stream of inner energy flowed into his body, mending injuries and easing pain.

Jinhua tugged Guan Yu’s sleeve. “But I’m not done shopping! How can we drag him around?”

“We’ll return today,” Guan Yu compromised. “Tomorrow, I’ll devote the entire day to you—I promise.”

Though pouting, the considerate girl relented. “You’d better keep your word! A full day, no excuses!”

“I swear it,” Guan Yu vowed.

The previously pickpocketed girl approached nervously in English: “Thank you for recovering my wallet. May I treat you to lunch?”

When Guan Yu and Jinhua looked blank, the youth translated. “She wants to buy us a meal.”

“Free food? Let’s go!” Jinhua chirped. Suspicion flickered across the girl’s face as she eyed Guan Yu’s rapport with the thief.

“You know each other?” she inquired.

“We just met,” Jinhua explained breezily. “It’s...complicated.”

Guan Yu suddenly realized their oversight. “What’s your name?” he asked the youth.

“Wang Xi before. Now they call me Ah Cai (Vegetable).”

Jinhua burst into laughter. “Ah Cai it is then!”

As she spoke, a burly Westerner in a low baseball cap lunged from the crowd. Guan Yu yanked Jinhua to safety while kicking Ah Cai sideways. A glinting dagger barely missed the youth’s back as the assailant melted into the crowd.

“Close call!” Jinhua gasped, clutching her chest.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “They’re silencing deserters. I expected watchers when taking in a first-time thief.” Helping Ah Cai up, he warned, “You’re marked now. They’ll keep coming.”

Ah Cai paled, rubbing his sore ribs. “They moved so fast...”

“Stay vigilant,” Guan Yu advised, though projecting calm. “They’ll regroup before striking again.”

Despite Jinhua’s urge to leave, Guan Yu insisted on accepting the lunch invitation. The foreign girl led them to her convertible, unaware of shadowy figures trailing their convoy.

En route, Ah Cai whispered anxiously, “They’re following. Maybe I should—”

“You’re my brother now,” Guan Yu interrupted firmly. “I protect what’s mine.”

Arriving at a suburban villa, they admired the manicured gardens—a stark contrast to China’s cramped apartments. As the girl proudly displayed her culinary skills, Guan Yu noted movement in the shrubbery. Let them come, he thought. Tonight would end this snake’s nest.
