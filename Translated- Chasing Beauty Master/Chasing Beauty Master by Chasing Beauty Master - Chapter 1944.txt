“If we’re being honest, the fact that several Right Envoys who’ve cultivated for centuries can’t defeat a new disciple who joined less than two years ago would be laughable if word got out.

Yet after that moment earlier, the Demon Sovereign had deeply sensed Guanyu’s extraordinary nature. Forget the Right Envoys—even he, a millennia-old veteran, had felt genuine fear under Guanyu’s threatening gaze and unyielding resolve. It was a visceral, bone-chilling terror. The icy gun barrel pressed to his forehead meant a single twitch of Guanyu’s finger would have ended him. Truly, the Demon Sovereign had been frozen in place.

**Chapter 5108: Reassurance Again**

“Xiaorong, you should understand your father’s painstaking efforts. Why can’t you see my intentions?” The Demon Sovereign regained his composure. “You know how perilous the East Sea is. You could avoid this entirely—why insist on risking yourself?”

Wang Xiaorong’s sobs still had not ceased. She never imagined a day would come when Guanyu and her father would confront each other so bitterly—a scenario she’d always dreaded, now unfolding abruptly before her.

With Xiaorong’s presence, even as a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect, Guanyu held an implicit “immunity” before the Demon Sovereign. The Demon Lord would never let Guanyu die by his hand, lest Xiaorong take her own life or forever disown him as her father—an outcome he could never bear.

“Father,” Wang Xiaorong wept, “I beg you to understand Guanyu’s impulsiveness. He’s always been this way. He can endure danger and humiliation, but he will never allow harm to those he loves.”

Turning to Guanyu, she added, “Guanyu, I hope you can forgive Father. He never meant to strike you earlier. Please… don’t hold it against him.” Her tears intensified as she spoke. Then, stepping away slowly, she murmured, “Since this conflict arose because of me… I’ll leave. Spare yourselves the anguish of my presence.”

“Xiaorong! Where are you going? Don’t act rashly!” The Demon Sovereign relented, his voice strained. “If you insist… stay by Guanyu’s side. I trust he can protect you.”

Hearing this, Xiaorong halted, turning back with tearful eyes. “Father, why must you stir such chaos? Had you not come, none of this would’ve happened! We were fine before. Now you’ve shattered everything!”

Had there been no outsiders present, the Demon Sovereign might have comforted his treasured daughter—the apple of his eye since childhood. But pride demanded he save face.

He’d anticipated this outcome when arriving, yet the reality stung. Guanyu’s emergence had shifted Xiaorong’s devotion entirely away from him, leaving the Demon Sovereign feeling both aggrieved and profoundly alone.

All understood his actions stemmed from paternal concern, yet executing that care proved agonizing. Rationality clashed with an irrepressible need to safeguard her.

Torn internally, the Demon Sovereign watched Xiaorong’s weeping subside slightly. Though father and daughter remained at odds, his heart ached more deeply than Guanyu’s ever could. But as a sect leader and a man, he couldn’t reveal vulnerability before others.

Swiveling toward Guanyu, he coldly declared, “You’ve nerve, boy. Regardless of our relation, I am your elder. Yet you dare aim a weapon at me? I’ll grant your recklessness stems from protectiveness. But do you grasp the scale of danger awaiting at the East Sea?”

“My actions earlier were reflexive—a response to Qiqi being threatened,” Guanyu countered. “The East Sea journey is perilous. I’ve urged Xiaorong to stay behind, but she insists on accompanying me. Even if she returned, she’d fret endlessly for my safety. Since this is her choice, I’ll guard her with my life. In life or death, none shall face it alone.”

“Your death matters little, but my Xiaorong must not perish. No one may harm a hair on her head!” The Demon Sovereign’s voice turned glacial. “A daughter’s loyalty shifts with marriage—now I comprehend that adage fully. Your words hold more sway over her than mine. Persuade her to return. You know it’s for her safety.”

He continued, “Otherwise, the East Sea will become a battleground of warring factions and demonic forces—a realm of endless peril without safe haven. Is that truly where you wish my daughter to tread?”

Guanyu acknowledged the logic, but the Demon Sovereign erred in expecting him to dissuade Xiaorong. Her determination stemmed precisely from the dangers Guanyu faced. No plea would sway her unless Guanyu himself abandoned the quest—an impossibility.

“I cannot persuade her,” Guanyu stated. “But I vow to prioritize her life above my own, regardless of what comes.”

The Demon Sovereign nodded grimly. “So be it. A regrettable impasse. Answer me this—if the Demon Soul Sect clashes with the Cloud Azure Sect, where will you stand?”

“I’ll withdraw from both sides,” Guanyu replied calmly. “I won’t oppose the Demon Soul Sect for sect loyalty, nor aid you for Xiaorong’s sake.”

“Refusing to aid Cloud Azure—or being exposed as Xiaorong’s lover—would brand you a traitor,” the Demon Sovereign warned.

“I care not. If Patriarch Xuanming draws blades against me, he alone pushes me toward your sect. He’ll understand the consequences.”

Indeed, Xuanming was no fool. In a full-scale conflict, with Guanyu remaining neutral, the Cloud Azure leader would likely feign ignorance rather than ostracize a potent ally.

**Chapter 5109: You’re a Fool**

Had Xuanming denounced Guanyu during such crises, he’d only drive him into enemy ranks—a self-sabotage no leader would commit.

After a weighted pause, the Demon Sovereign muttered, “Very well. I rue the day Xiaorong met you… yet your courage commands respect. Do not fail her.”

“I never fail those I choose to protect,” Guanyu asserted. “Let today’s conflict end here. Any future grievances—direct them at me. Spare Xiaorong further heartache.”

“Heartache? You think I desire this?” The Demon Sovereign seized a fresh angle. “If you truly love her, why cling to Cloud Azure? Prove your devotion by joining the Demon Soul Sect!”

“Love resides in the heart, not mere actions,” Guanyu retorted. “Remove the seal in my mind, and I’ll join your sect without hesitation. My sole purpose in Cloud Azure is to break that seal—a fact you’ve long known.”

The Demon Sovereign had forgotten this. During Guanyu’s prior stay, he’d detected the mental seal, theorizing it might be shattered by Cloud Azure’s sacred artifacts. Yet attempts to aid had failed due to conflicting spiritual energies.

Changing tack, the Demon Sovereign demanded, “Answer me this—what immortal artifact did you trade to Xuanming for the Soul-Devouring Whip?”

Guanyu saw no reason for secrecy. “I chanced upon a White Eye—a natural-born immortal artifact. But its spirit refused submission. Thus, I exchanged it for multiple artifacts, not just the whip.”

“Multiple? What else?”

“A Blood Sword, a demonic jade flute, golden leaves, and more. Why this interest?”

“Because you’re a fool!” The Demon Sovereign spat. “An immortal artifact’s worth eclipses ten Soul-Devouring Whips! You traded a treasure for trash! Xuanming swindled his own disciple!”

“The exchange was my choice,” Guanyu corrected. “The artifact’s spirit deemed me unworthy. Useless as it was, better to gain practical tools.”

“Fool! You’re a rare dual cultivator—destined for greatness! Once powerful, you’d have subdued that spirit. Now where will you find another immortal artifact?”

“When I ascend, I’ll reclaim what’s mine from Xuanming.” Guanyu’s retort left the Demon Sovereign speechless.

The matter concluded, the Demon Sovereign turned to Xiaorong. “Stay vigilant. Survival above all.” With that, he departed.

Only after his exit did Guanyu holster his pistol. His earlier confrontation had terrified Xiaorong, who understood his protective instincts—even against Patriarch Xuanming himself. Though Guanyu’s actions seemed extreme, she couldn’t fault him for defending Qiqi.

Embracing both women, Guanyu vowed, “Whatever dangers await, I’ll shield you both. Should harm befall you, I’ll drag your foes to oblivion.”

Two days later, Xiao Tang arrived with reinforcements—over thirty warriors assembled in the inn’s hall, all formidable allies recruited by Du Teng.

**Chapter 5110: State Your Demands**

“This is Guanyu—Du Teng’s sworn brother and the man we aid,” Xiao Tang announced.

“Friends,” Guanyu addressed them, “I’m deeply grateful for your assistance. Rest first—all expenses are mine. Feast tonight, then retire to your rooms. We’ll discuss plans tomorrow.”

The warriors approved—no immediate demands, just hospitality. Guanyu noted their caliber: any one could overpower Jiang Yuan’s lackeys. Thirty such experts constituted an unprecedented force.

“State any requests,” Guanyu added. “Funds are no concern—enjoy yourselves within reason.”

A hulking man wielding a spiked club stepped forward. “Brother Guanyu, I’ve one vice—gambling. Lost all my silver on bets during the journey. Advance me some funds?”

Xiao Tang interjected, “Du Teng gave everyone twenty taels. Gone already?”

Guanyu waved dismissively. Qiqi produced a stack of banknotes—prepared funds for precisely such requests. The gambler’s grin widened as silver changed hands.
