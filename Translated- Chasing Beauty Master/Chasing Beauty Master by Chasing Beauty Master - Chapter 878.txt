At this moment, Jones couldn't break free to assist Guan Yu. Those clones conjured by Junior Sister were truly repulsive, completely encircling Jones. To avoid harming Uncle Qing, Jones had deliberately drawn the battlefield far away.

With cultivation nearing First-Class Sovereign level, Jones remained impervious to Junior Sister's assaults. Her only recourse was employing clones to contain Jones, prolonging their stalemate.

When the distant explosion reverberated through the air earlier, Jones' heart clenched with worry for Guan Yu's safety.

Ma He slowly rose to his feet, gazing at Guan Yu's disheveled figure in the distance. Seeing the man's battered state, he chuckled darkly. "Guan Yu, today marks your demise. Younger brother, I finally avenge you!" His laughter echoed maniacally across the nightscape.

The frenzied mirth gradually subsided into cold calculation. "I must admit admiration for your capabilities," Ma He continued, "A Second-Class Sovereign surviving my ultimate strike? Remarkable talent... Pity it ends here."

Guan Yu suppressed the turmoil within his meridians, retorting with forced calm: "Delusions. You think mere posturing guarantees victory? Having withstood your best, I'll do so again." He gambled that Ma He couldn't replicate that devastating attack. His priority now: maintain facade, conceal vulnerability.

While secretly circulating vital energy, Guan Yu pressed: "Your brother Ma Hai's atrocities knew no bounds - cruel methods, threats against my woman. Executing him was celestial justice."

"Blood demands blood!" Ma He roared, veins bulging. "You killed my flesh and blood. Retribution is heaven's decree!" Even as he spat venom, both men subtly regulated their breathing - warriors preparing for the next clash.

"You being First-Class Sovereign, defeat's understandable," Guan Yu conceded, leaning heavily against a sapling. "But think me easy prey?" Every word was calculated theater. In truth, moving a finger required Herculean effort.

Ma He hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at him. That mysterious protective aura surrounding Guan Yu defied comprehension. Cautiously gathering internal energy, he countered: "I respect your prowess - suspect you're no mere Second-Class. But in single combat today, you stand no chance."

Truth rang in those words. Head-on confrontation meant certain defeat. Yet Guan Yu played for time, having secretly called reinforcements upon anticipating Ma He's involvement.

"Ma He," Guan Yu shifted tactics, "Your collusion with the Feng Family kidnapping my friend? We reported it. Though they bought silence, all blame's shifted to you. As foreign national, you're now hunted nationwide. What escape remains?"

Chapter 2247: As Expected, There Was a Problem

After escaping Guan Yu last time, gravely wounded Ma He recuperated in seclusion. There, fate intertwined him with Junior Sister - initial hostility giving way to uneasy alliance upon discovering shared enmity.

They conspired: Ma He would eliminate Uncle Qing; Junior Sister would then aid against Guan Yu. Tonight's assault was their design. The rapid arrival of Guan Yu's allies disrupted plans - while Junior Sister contemplated retreat, Ma He's pride refused withdrawal.

Previously outmatched by Guan Yu-Jones teamwork, Ma He now believed isolating Guan Yu guaranteed victory. Yet reality confounded expectations - Guan Yu's tenacity defied all logic. Where others would've been pulverized, he stood bloodied but unbowed.

As for the police manhunt and Feng Family's betrayal? News to Ma He, isolated during recovery. "Rather than wasting effort on me," Guan Yu pressed, observing Ma He's shifting expressions, "Shouldn't you confront the Fengs?"

"Convenient timing!" Ma He snarled, rising with renewed vigor. "After finishing you, I'll settle with Feng Clan. If authorities hunt me regardless, perishing with you suffices!"

Guan Yu mentally cursed - his拖延 tactic backfired, igniting Ma He's suicidal fury. "Must you be so obtuse? The Fengs manipulated Ma Hai against me! They're your true foe!"

"Details don't concern me," Ma He towered menacingly, vitality visibly restoring. "Only outcomes matter." His stance signaled imminent lethal strike.

"Very well," Guan Yu feigned resignation. "I can't even lift a finger. Claim your prize." Despair laced his tone, yet posture remained defiant.

Ma He froze, instincts warning of trickery. Guan Yu's reputation for cunning made passive surrender inconceivable. "What scheme brews now?" he demanded.

"What could I possibly muster?" Guan Yu coughed weakly. "Finish it, unless you've grown womanish."

Paranoia stayed Ma He's hand. Precious seconds bought - within Guan Yu's body, vital energies raged like stormy seas. A sudden relaxation triggered bloody vomit spraying crimson.

Ma He's strike had been cataclysmic - survival spoke volumes about Guan Yu's mysterious protections. "Seems fate smiles on me," Ma He gloated, producing glinting dagger. "Convey regards to my brother in hell!"

Steel met steel in shrieking clash. When dust settled, Guan Yu still leaned against his tree. Ma He lay meters away, chest split open to reveal pulsating organs - courtesy of Wolf Second's timely intervention.

"Cutting it close," Guan Yu exhaled, addressing the newcomer. "Enjoyed the spectacle?"

Wolf Second shrugged, sheathing his blade. "Barely made it. Seconds later, you'd be Yama's guest."

"Bullshit," Guan Yu retorted. "Felt your presence when he mentioned mutual destruction. Why the dramatic delay?"

Chapter 2248: Internal Injuries

Wolf Second's eyebrows arched. "A Second-Class detecting my aura? Unheard of!"

"Perception transcends cultivation," Guan Yu smirked. "Peak experts' presences don't escape me, unless exceptionally concealed."

Their banter continued until Uncle Qing's group arrived. After brief introductions and situation assessments, Wolf Second departed as abruptly as he came.

"Should relocate," Jones advised Uncle Qing. "Junior Sister might return, and police will swarm after Ma He's corpse."

Back at Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu's bloodied appearance sent his women into hysterics. Amidst their fretting, Yang Conghan's practical inquiry stood out: "What transpired? Resolved? Need assistance?"

Xue Jing, though composed, eyed Guan Yu's injuries grimly. "Who dared this? My sisters must be informed."

Chapter 2249: Much Ado About Nothing

As the women fussed over him, Guan Yu lamented internally - physical agony paled compared to managing their panic. Only Yang Conghan's level-headedness provided respite amidst the chaos.
