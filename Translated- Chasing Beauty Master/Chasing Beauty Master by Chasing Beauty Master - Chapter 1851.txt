“Since they couldn’t lay hands on Jiang Yuankai, the Cao family naturally wouldn’t let this matter rest. After thorough investigations, they discovered Hongyan Theater belonged to Wan Hong and thus targeted it. This was the Cao family’s true objective. Moreover, they knew the Cao clan wouldn’t stop after Cao Di’s brutal beating. But before their next move materialized, their own territories were unexpectedly sabotaged.

After pondering these events, Duan Ruxue concluded that this Wan Hong remained an enigma. Though he stood before her, she couldn’t fathom the depths of his capabilities. Unraveling his secrets would require extended investigation.

Upon returning, Duan Ruxue resolved to deploy more agents to uncover Wan Hong’s true identity. For now, his feud with the Cao clan made him a potential ally for the Duan family.

“I won’t deny Miss Duan’s assessment,” Guanyu said. “I’m a man of limited tolerance—I dislike being disadvantaged.”

“Hehe, I greatly admire Young Master Wan Hong’s temperament and principles,” Duan Ruxue replied, already convinced of his involvement. She wondered what sparks would fly between him and the Cao clan next.

“Didn’t you express interest in meeting our family tailor?” Duan Ruxue continued. “The Duan residence awaits your visit at your convenience.”

This invitation carried significant honor. Ordinary visitors needed pretexts to enter the Duan estate—even notable figures required prior notice. The unrestricted access granted to Guanyu was extraordinary treatment.

Even Tang Muchen, renowned throughout the capital, needed business pretexts to visit. Jiang Xin required advance notice through maidservants for sisterly visits. Yet Guanyu received open access—an unprecedented privilege.

Duan Ruxue’s deeper motive lay in cultivating ties with this mysterious enemy of the Cao clan. Having such an unpredictable ally could shield the Duan family from future conflicts with the Caos.

“Wan Hong, you’ve truly ascended!” Jiang Xin exclaimed. “The Duan estate isn’t some common marketplace. Even I must send advance notice to visit Ruxue, often receiving excuses about her busy schedule. You’re the first granted unrestricted access!”

“My gratitude, Miss Duan. This humble one is overwhelmed,” Guanyu said. “Does your tailor reside within the estate? I’d like to meet them when time permits.”

“Whenever you visit, I’ll summon the tailor immediately,” Duan Ruxue assured. “They don’t live onsite, but arranging meetings poses no difficulty.”

Guanyu nodded appreciatively. Establishing connections with the Duan family pleased him, though deeper ties would require winning over the family patriarch’s favor.

“No need for formalities, Young Master Wan Hong,” Duan Ruxue added. “Jiang Xin, from today onward, you too may visit without prior notice. Does this satisfy you?”

“Hmph! That’s more reasonable,” Jiang Xin retorted, hands on hips. “Even as a princess, I’ve never faced such bureaucratic hassles. Meeting you used to require palace-level coordination!”

Chapter 4865: Unforeseen Developments

Guanyu found Jiang Xin more approachable despite her noble status. Unlike typical aristocrats, she maintained down-to-earth camaraderie.

Jiang Xin’s vibrant personality contrasted with Duan Ruxue’s reclusive tendencies. While Duan managed family affairs adeptly, she avoided public appearances to dodge schemers.

The Duan family maintained isolationist policies among the Four Great Clans, focusing solely on their enterprises without meddling in others’ affairs—a philosophy mirroring Guanyu’s own.

“Rest assured, Young Master Wan Hong,” Duan Ruxue vowed. “Today’s discussion stays between us. What the Cao clan discovers through their own means becomes their affair.”

Guanyu nodded. “I understand completely. Having provoked the Caos, I’m prepared for consequences.”

Chu Fan’s anxious expression betrayed his concerns. With outsiders present, he bit back his worries about Cao retaliation.

“Your boldness against the Caos commands respect,” Duan Ruxue remarked. “But you should know—they’ve allied with the Qin family. Developments remain unpredictable.”

Jiang Xin erupted: “How dare they form alliances! This reeks of rebellion! The imperial decree expressly forbids Great Clan coalitions!”

The princess vowed to inform her mother, the Grand Princess, who would petition the Emperor. Imperial intervention could check Cao-Qin ambitions while benefiting Duan and Tang families.

Guanyu recognized the strategic advantage—leveraging imperial power against the Caos might cripple their influence. Duan Ruxue concealed her secret pact with Tang Muchen, letting Jiang Xin’s outrage serve their agenda.

Chapter 4866: Apprehensions

“The Caos overstep imperial decrees!” Duan Ruxue fanned the flames. “Jiang Xin, you must inform the court!”

“For Chu Fan’s sake and justice, I’ll stop them!” Jiang Xin declared.

Guanyu sought clarification on the alliance prohibition. Duan Ruxue explained: “The Four Clans’ combined strength could theoretically challenge the throne. Hence, their coalition is deemed rebellion.”

Though actual rebellion remained improbable, emperors tolerated no potential threats. The decree maintained balance through division.

“The Caos disgrace themselves allying with Qins!” Jiang Xin scoffed.

Duan Ruxue smiled coolly. “Blame rests not with their stupidity, but Young Master Wan Hong’s brilliant subterfuge. The Caos never anticipated such an adversary.”

Chu Fan fretted: “Can the Grand Princess truly stop them? What about Hongyan Theater’s reconstruction? With Cao vendettas...”

Guanyu dismissed concerns: “The Caos are gnats beneath notice. I’ll resolve matters before the theater reopens.”

“Exactly!” Jiang Xin supported. “The Caos don’t even know their true enemy yet!”

Chu Fan reluctantly acquiesced, though doubts lingered about Guanyu’s confidence. Their discussion halted when Wang Xiaorong’s angry shout pierced the air.

Across the room, a lanky man harassed Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. Guanyu’s expression darkened as he strode toward the confrontation.

“Step back, you creep!” Qiqi brandished her tiny fist. “Or taste my knuckles!”
