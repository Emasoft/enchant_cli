A three-star magic circle lit up beneath the direwolf's paws – Earth Sovereign Peak! This demonic wolf was actually a peak Earth Sovereign magical beast! Mu Bai watched Guan Yu's retreating figure with growing concern. Just as he prepared to intervene, an astonishing sight froze him in place – a matching three-star magic circle blossomed under Guan Yu's feet. Earth Sovereign Peak! She was actually a peak Earth Sovereign-level superhuman!

The emergence of this magic circle plunged Mu Bai and his companions into stunned silence. How old was she? A peak Earth Sovereign? This had to be a joke! Oblivious to their shock, Guan Yu focused solely on the charging direwolf. In a flash of movement, she materialized before the beast. Her Soul Devouring Whip lashed out like lightning, coiling around its neck. With a vicious yank, the wolf's head tumbled to the ground while its body continued charging forward by momentum before collapsing moments later. Instant annihilation! Complete and utter domination! This had been a magical beast of equal rank! Slaughtered in mere seconds! The group's collective shock deepened.

Suddenly everything became clear – how she'd saved their young master, why she possessed confidence to challenge Saint Sovereign-level demons. Yet her talent defied comprehension. An eleven- or twelve-year-old peak Earth Sovereign superhuman? This surpassed even the legendary aptitude of Demon Realm Prince Ye Wuhen, who'd only reached Earth Sovereign Peak at fourteen! She'd outpaced him by two full years!

Retracting her whip, Guan Yu stepped over the stupefied group and returned to her meditation circle within the fiery perimeter. As Mu Bai observed her silhouette, realization dawned – she hadn't abandoned them earlier, but had instead eliminated the wolf threat. This ice-cold exterior concealed unexpected warmth. Yes! She'd done this for me, Mu Bai convinced himself. Turning to his still-dazed companions, he stated flatly: "Now you've witnessed her true power."

A wave of collective shame washed over the group. They'd mocked a peak Earth Sovereign as mere entertainment, only to become the true clowns themselves. How profoundly this proved the adage – one should never judge by appearances, just as the sea cannot be measured with a dipper! Rong Shi examined the wolf corpses with awe. "Such terrifying perception," he murmured. "To detect wolves at that distance... And that monstrous talent... Given time, she'll become an existence that chills the soul. This child is no common pond fish!"

Mu Bai approached Guan Yu, studying her intently as if trying to pierce through her mask. What beauty lay hidden beneath that barrier? Startled by his intense gaze, Guan Yu's eyes snapped open to find his handsome face inches from hers. "Why are you staring?!" she demanded. Flustered, Mu Bai scratched his head. "I... wanted to thank you."

"Hmm. I simply can't lose my free guide," came the frosty reply.

Situ Jiannan stepped forward with a bow. "Miss Xiu Luo! Please forgive our earlier disrespect!" Genuine contrition colored his tone. Guan Yu acknowledged with a distracted hum. Her display had earned the group's respect – in this realm, power ruled supreme.

Chapter 1576: Situ Jiannan

At dawn's light, the party traversed the endless desert unmolested. Last night's slaughter likely deterred further wolf attacks. "Where are you headed, Xiu Luo?" Mu Bai inquired casually. "The Netherworld," came the icy response. Mu Bai blinked. "But... we're already in the Netherworld." Guan Yu halted abruptly. "This... is the Netherworld?" She gazed skyward, whispering, "Akalili... I've returned."

"Where exactly in the Netherworld?" Mu Bai pressed. "The Royal Capital." Her voice carried such glacial intensity it chilled Mu Bai's bones. Enemies awaited there? "And your home?" Mu Bai probed, suspicions rising. Could this be a demon spy? The group tensed – their Mu Feng City guarded the Netherworld's borders against demon incursions.

Sensing their wariness, Guan Yu clarified: "I have no home. I merely reclaim what's mine at the capital." She quickened her pace. Let them think what they would – her purpose remained singular.

Relief washed over the group. Mu Bai chased after her retreating figure. "If you've no home... let mine be yours." Guan Yu froze, unexpected warmth blooming in her chest. This reminded her of Feng-gege who'd once protected her... Would her brother be Mu Bai's age now?

A faint smile escaped before she strode onward. "Silence means consent!" Mu Bai called after her. Rong Shi shook his head – their naive young master embracing this mysterious child... He could only pray she meant no harm.

Demon Realm: "Heng'er, journey to the Netherworld soon," instructed Murong Fengyu. The black-clad youth's eyes narrowed until she explained: "The Nether King's birthday approaches." Comprehension dawned – what better occasion to... enliven celebrations? "Understood," he replied, toying with a dagger as a perfect smile curved his lips.

Endless Desert: A thud interrupted their trek. "Young Master! Zhou Xu collapsed!" Situ Jiannan shouted. Mu Bai rushed to the fallen man. "Water!"

"None left," Rong Shi croaked, parched throat rasping. "Li Ming's group reached their limit days ago." Guan Yu's delicate brows furrowed in displeasure. Without warning, she launched a wind blade at Mu Bai! Rong Shi moved to intercept but couldn't match her speed. Damnation! If the young master perished...

Mu Bai watched the approaching attack, then... smiled. The blade whistled past his ear to impale a lurking direwolf behind him. The group gaped at the twitching corpse – slaughtered mid-pounce. "Such terrifying perception!" Rong Shi marveled. Their young master's trust proved justified.

Amid stunned silence, Guan Yu collected Zhou Xu's water pouch. With precise wind blade, she opened the wolf's artery and caught its blood. Understanding flashed – this vile liquid could save lives. Forced to drink, Zhou Xu awoke retching. "Blood?!" he gasped, revolted by the metallic tang. Guan Yu calmly drank another pouch, savoring it like nectar. The group shuddered – demon or human?

Mu Feng City Gates: "We're home!" Situ Jiannan cried. Rong Shi's eyes glistened. Guan Yu surveyed the border fortress – this was the Netherworld's edge? Mu Bai pointed excitedly: "Xiu Luo, behold Mu Feng City!" Her indifferent "Hmm" disappointed him. What could pierce that icy shell?

"Mother! I'm home!" Mu Bai's shout summoned an elegant matriarch. "My child!" Tears flowed freely. Guan Yu blinked at the endearment "Mu'er" –木耳? Edible fungus? Her distracted musing broke when Madame Yi Shuirou noticed her. "I am Xiu Luo," came the uncharacteristically soft reply, stunning companions. This ice queen... gentle?

Seeing Madame Yi's maternal concern, Guan Yu recalled her own mother's face – her sole warmth in the Netherworld. As Mu Bai administered Blood Lotus essence to his father, Guan Yu's heart ached. What of her royal parents and sister now?

City Streets: Days later, Guan Yu wandered Mu Feng's bustling markets – so different from palace confines! A carriage suddenly careened toward her. As bystanders cried warnings, she calmly unsheathed her whip. Before impact, white robes swept her to safety. "Brother?!" she breathed, staring at her rescuer – the spitting image of her lost sibling!

"Miss, are you unharmed?" The white-clad youth's companion demanded. Guan Yu's glare could flay skin. "Xiu Luo!" Mu Bai's voice interrupted. "Why sneak out?" he pouted. Before explanations, tension crackled – the rescuers were demons! Their leader emerged: black-robed, arrogant, and devastatingly handsome – the Demon Prince himself.

Chapter 1577: Demon Realm's Response

Trapped in her savior's arms, Guan Yu whispered "Gege..." The white-clad youth stiffened. "Apologies," the demon leader offered. "No harm done," the youth replied coldly, setting Guan Yu down. "Be more careful, child." His eyes held wistful pain – so like his lost sister...

"Wait, I'm—" Guan Yu began, but Mu Bai interrupted. "Xiu Luo! Why wander off?" As they bickered, the white-clad youth's guard reported: "My lord, these are demonkind!" Tension escalated. Guan Yu's murderous glare pinned the guard – she knew this face! The demon prince emerged, yawning with panther-like grace, his dark splendor contrasting the white-clad youth's purity. Two princes – light and dark – now stood face-to-face, while between them raged storms of past grievances and future calamities.
