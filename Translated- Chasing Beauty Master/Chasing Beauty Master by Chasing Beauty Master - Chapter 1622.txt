“However, Consort Guifen did not expose the Second Prince’s pretense, choosing instead to observe his true intentions.

“Indeed, Prince Zou is our shared adversary. His presence in the palace cannot bode well for the Crown Prince either, can it?” The Second Prince met Consort Guifen’s gaze. “Thus, my purpose today is to propose an alliance. If we combine our strengths, I am certain we can eradicate him.”

Consort Guifen chuckled softly. “Your Highness’s capabilities are unparalleled. Even if the Imperial Secret Guard proves ineffective, Chancellor Li’s Imperial Palace Guards are no mere decoration. Eliminating a minor prince like Zou should be effortless for you.”

The Second Prince smiled wryly. “You flatter me, Consort. Those incompetents have achieved nothing—from Liaozhou City to the present, Prince Zou has nearly reached Bajia City unimpeded. Now that he has enlisted jianghu factions, both the Imperial Secret Guard and Palace Guards are outmatched. Hence, I seek your collaboration to crush him together.”

**Chapter 4213: Refusal**

“An alliance would be advantageous,” Consort Guifen probed, “but how exactly do you require our assistance? Might you elaborate on your strategy?”

Though Prince Zou’s recruitment of martial factions was undeniable, Consort Guifen would never permit the Second Prince to sacrifice her elite troops as cannon fodder.

The Second Prince pressed, “Your elite battalion under Yu Kong teems with experts. If they join forces with mine, we can surely claim Prince Zou’s head in Bajia City and rid ourselves of this mutual threat.”

“Even if Prince Zou is guarded by countless masters,” Consort Guifen countered, “Your Highness’s influence should render them insignificant. If the Imperial Secret Guard falters, the Palace Guards remain. Should both fail, what use would my troops be? I doubt they surpass your forces.”

“Moreover,” she added, twirling a luminous night-pearl in her hand, “the Emperor monitors the elite battalion closely. Losing over a hundred men would cost both Yu Kong and me our heads.” Her smile sharpened. “It seems you’ve already discovered my informants within the Imperial Secret Guard.”

The Second Prince sighed. “You’ve witnessed the Imperial Secret Guard’s inadequacy against Prince Zou. That is why I approach you. Surely you too desire his elimination?”

“Not entirely. My son lacks your intellect. Though I once aspired to secure the throne for him, we cannot rival you. Thus, we concede. Your sole obstacle is Prince Zou. Remove him, and your path to succession clears.”

Her refusal was unambiguous: she would not squander her forces as pawns.

Consort Guifen continued, “I trust you’ll devise a way to eliminate Prince Zou. Twenty-odd deaths in the Imperial Secret Guard hardly sway the broader game.” She admired the night-pearl, a tacit acknowledgment of his bribe to silence her.

Cooperation was rejected. If the Imperial Secret Guard and Palace Guards failed, her elite battalion would fare no better.

The Second Prince feigned acquiescence. “You speak wisely, Consort. Harmony is paramount. I shall take my leave.”

After his departure, Yu Kong emerged. “Why refuse this opportunity, Your Grace?”

“I’ll not send our men to die. The Imperial Secret Guard’s heavy losses prove Prince Zou is well-protected. Let Chancellor Li’s Palace Guards engage him first. His survival remains uncertain.”

Yu Kong persisted, “An alliance might yield results. Eliminating Prince Zou benefits us.”

“Our forces are no sacrificial pawns,” Consort Guifen declared. “The Second Prince’s true aim was to silence me about the Imperial Secret Guard’s failures. Let him confront Prince Zou. We’ll monitor closely and strike when opportune—against both Prince Zou *and* the Second Prince’s faction.”

**Chapter 4214: Reaping What One Sows**

Consort Guifen’s ambitions eclipsed the Second Prince’s. She sought to eradicate not only Prince Zou but also his rival’s supporters.

Yu Kong ventured, “Our previous attempts to hire jianghu factions against Prince Zou proved futile. Should we try again?”

“Spare no expense,” she ordered. “Seek capable mercenaries. Prince Zou’s retinue is formidable. Once the Palace Guards are depleted in battling him, we’ll incite turmoil in the rear palace. Let the Second Prince bear the Emperor’s wrath for the Secret Guard’s losses and the Guards’ casualties. With his influence crippled, the Crown Prince shall reign unchallenged.”

She calculated coldly: the Emperor’s death would force a succession. If the Second Prince triumphed, she and her son faced exile or death. Conversely, her son’s ascension demanded the Second Prince’s eradication.

The Crown Prince’s dullness complicated her schemes, yet she persevered. Now, while the Second Prince focused on Prince Zou, she would undermine him covertly.

The Imperial Palace Guards, overseen by Chancellor Li, guarded the rear palace. Their mobilization would leave the Emperor vulnerable to her orchestrated “crises”—minor disturbances implicating the Second Prince’s negligence.

“Execute this flawlessly,” she instructed. “The Emperor is astute. Blame must fall solely on the Second Prince.”

**Chapter 4215: Letting Nature Take Its Course**

Later, Consort Guifen visited the Crown Prince’s austere residence, a stark contrast to the Second Prince’s opulent estate.

“Mother Consort, why visit unannounced?” The Crown Prince—tall, gaunt, and simple—greeted her.

She presented the night-pearl. “A gift from the Second Prince. Keep it for your future bride.”

He shrugged. “I care not for trinkets.”

Surveying his barren halls, she sighed. “You must wed. The Second Prince already has three consorts, one soon to deliver. I’ll select a worthy bride for you—docile, lest she exploit your gentleness.”

He nodded apathetically.

“The Second Prince’s recent blunders with the Imperial Secret Guard weaken him,” she pressed. “Strike now.”

The Crown Prince remained impassive. “Rest first, Mother.”

Alone, Consort Guifen seethed. Her son’s apathy maddened her, yet she plotted tirelessly. If he could not grasp ambition, she would wield it for him—until the throne was theirs.
