“Ouch, it still hurts so much! It’s all your fault for being so rough!” Xiaomei pouted resentfully at Guanyu, her delicate features scrunched in a theatrical pout. “My foot hasn’t healed at all. I can’t ride the camel alone anymore. I don’t care—you have to carry me!”

“What? You can’t be serious!” Guanyu exclaimed, his eyebrows shooting up.

“Of course I am!” she retorted, hopping nimbly off her camel on one foot. With exaggerated limping, she sidled up to Siqi. “Look at me! I need to keep my foot elevated to ease the pain. You’ll have to lead my camel now. Thanks!” Without waiting for agreement, she thrust the reins into Siqi’s hands before hobbling back to Guanyu. “Hurry up and lift me onto your camel! Standing here is exhausting!”

Guanyu sighed inwardly. Was her injury genuine or another ploy? Carrying her would undoubtedly ignite Siqi’s temper. “My camel is already fatigued,” he said evenly. “Why not let my junior brother carry you instead?”

In truth, Xiaomei’s foot had fully healed. Though pierced by a crossbow bolt yesterday, Guanyu’s spiritual energy and her own cultivation had mended it—a minor injury for an immortal practitioner. Her current theatrics were pure mischief, a bid to nestle into Guanyu’s arms while needling Siqi.

When Guanyu glanced at Wang Jun for help, the latter recoiled. “No way! I’m terrified of snakes!” Aze pointedly turned away, feigning sudden fascination with the horizon. The others shared their apprehension—Xiaomei’s true serpentine form made her embrace a perilous prospect.

Noticing their wary glances, Xiaomei plopped onto the sand, wailing and kicking up dust. “Waaah! You all despise me!” Her crocodile tears flowed freely as she pointed accusingly at Guanyu. “Yesterday you were so sweet, whispering pretty words and caressing me! Now you act cold? Liar! I won’t guide you to Miao City anymore! Find it yourselves!”

Every eye swiveled to Guanyu, including Siqi’s frosty glare. His ears burned crimson. “Don’t twist things!” he protested. “You’ll ruin my reputation and stir unnecessary conflict!”

Xiaomei sniffled dramatically. “Deny it all you want! My robes still bear your drool! Are you so cowardly you won’t own up to yesterday?”

Siqi’s gaze softened. She trusted Guanyu implicitly. Why would he pursue this viperous creature when he had her? Moreover, Xiaomei wasn’t even fully human—a fact that settled Siqi’s momentary jealousy. Still, the barb stung.

“Enough!” Guanyu snapped. “If this continues, we part ways here.”

Noticing the faint scar on Xiaomei’s ankle—a remnant of Siqi’s mercury-laced bolt—Siqi interjected coolly, “If your injury requires rest, we’ll camp here until you recover. We’ve time before the fifteenth of July.”

The group tensed at her glacial tone. Xiaomei, cornered by her own ruse, acquiesced. “Two days should suffice.” In truth, riding wouldn’t aggravate the wound, but retreating now would unravel her act. Secretly, she nursed residual pain—the mercury poisoning had demanded strenuous purification. A permanent scar now marred her ankle, a bitter souvenir beneath her adornments.

At noon, as the group prepared meager rations, a voice summoned them: “The Holy Maiden invites you to dine.”

Inside Xiaomei’s lavish felt tent, low tables encircled her central seat—a calculated arrangement to flank Guanyu. He deliberately chose a rear position, only for Xiaomei to tease, “Sitting behind me to peek, Guanyu?”

The meal unfolded with thinly veiled tension. “Siqi,” Xiaomei purred over roasted beef, “why choose him? What makes Guanyu special?”

“He chose me,” Siqi replied archly. “That’s honor enough.”

Undeterred, Xiaomei turned to Aze. “No wife yet? Let me introduce my sister.” A snap of her fingers summoned a golden python from the shadows.

Aze’s scream pierced the tent, a half-chewed morsel tumbling from his gaping mouth. Wang Jun choked on his food, while Guanyu barely stifled a laugh. The serpent coiled lazily as Xiaomei grinned. “She adores humorous men like you.”

Aze trembled like a leaf in a storm, his phobia laid bare. Even Wang Jun edged backward, though Guanyu remained unperturbed—this wasn’t his first encounter with Xiaomei’s “sister.”

“Relax,” Xiaomei crooned, stroking the python’s head. “She’s quite gentle… unless provoked.” Her eyes glinted with mischief as Aze scrambled behind Guanyu, his bravado evaporated.

The meal continued, a precarious dance of veiled barbs and forced civility. Xiaomei’s schemes simmered beneath courtly manners, her every word a needle probing for weaknesses. Yet Guanyu’s resolve held firm—this serpent’s charms wouldn’t unravel the bonds he cherished.
