After Guan Yu finished speaking, Old Lu’s expression shifted immediately. He hastily said, “Guan Yu, since you’ve already chosen one artifact from Sect Leader Xuanming, I can’t fall behind! Take a look—do any of my treasures catch your eye?”

With a wave of his hand, Old Lu summoned all his collections—over a dozen artifacts now floated in the air. Though fewer than Xuanming’s, these artifacts dazzled with a riot of colors. Xuanming’s pieces were mostly pale blue, yellow, or white, but Old Lu’s array glowed with red, black, green, and more.

“Wow, these colors are striking!” Guan Yu remarked cheerfully, having anticipated this very moment.

But Xuanming frowned, his voice edged with displeasure. “Junior Brother Lu, Guan Yu has already selected one of my artifacts. By yesterday’s agreement, that makes him my disciple. Do you mean to go back on your word?”

Xuanming would not tolerate this. He had reluctantly parted with a precious artifact to secure Guan Yu as his disciple—losing him now would render that sacrifice meaningless.

Old Lu waved dismissively. “Sect Leader, we all know what you gave him was a support-type artifact. A support artifact doesn’t count! He needs a primary combat weapon too.”

“You—this is pure sophistry!” Xuanming snapped.

Guan Yu chimed in, “Grandpa Xuan, Grandpa Lu has a point. I still lack a proper weapon. Choosing a primary artifact makes sense.”

Grudgingly, Xuanming summoned his artifacts again, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Old Lu as if they were street vendors hawking wares. Guan Yu’s eyes gleamed, but he was clueless about evaluating artifacts. The two elders bickered fiercely, faces flushed, on the verge of blows.

Though inexperienced, Guan Yu hatched a plan. “Grandpas, since I’m a novice, I’ll need your help. To make a fair choice, each of you must critique the other’s artifacts. If I’m satisfied, I’ll decide.”

Old Lu brightened—boasting about his treasures was second nature. Xuanming, however, seethed inwardly. Not only had he lost an artifact, but now he had to praise another? Yet he had no choice.

Guan Yu hid a smile. Who knew he’d become so sought-after? Joining the Cloud Azure Mountain sect had opened doors to cultivators, and now he reveled in their rivalry. Since cultivating required powerful tools, he aimed to secure the best artifacts now—opportunities like this were rare.

Spotting a jade ruyi among Old Lu’s artifacts, Guan Yu inquired, “Grandpa Lu, this ruyi looks exquisite. What makes it special?” He then turned to Xuanming. “Grandpa Xuan, what do you think?”

Xuanming scoffed. “That trinket suits women, not warriors. Wielding such a delicate piece in battle would look absurd. Choose something more imposing.”

Guan Yu nodded—appearances mattered. A fearsome weapon would command respect.

Old Lu retorted, “Appearances deceive! The ancient Scholar Deity wielded a mere talisman, yet it was a divine artifact. Judge by power, not looks!”

Intrigued, Guan Yu pressed, “What can this ruyi do?”

Old Lu explained, “I seized this from a Demon Sect leader’s daughter centuries ago. Though once a demonic tool, I purified its corruption over a century. Now, it’s a top-grade artifact with vast spiritual capacity—though its full potential remains untapped.”

“A demonic relic?” Guan Yu recoiled. “But it radiates golden light!”

“The dark aura is gone,” Old Lu assured. “In righteous hands, it’s harmless. A tool’s nature depends on its wielder!”

Xuanming warned, “Demonic artifacts corrupt their users over time. Why risk it?”

Unfazed, Old Lu declared, “Guan Yu, I’ll gift you this ruyi as a welcome present. No strings attached!”

Guan Yu snatched it with a bow. “Thank you, Grandpa Lu!” He hid a grin—two artifacts acquired, with more to come.

Old Lu’s jaw twitched, his heart bleeding as Guan Yu pocketed the treasure.

“I’m deeply honored by both your generosity,” Guan Yu proclaimed. “I’ll never forget this kindness!”

Flattery soothed the elders’ frayed nerves. Xuanming forced a smile. “We foresee you becoming Cloud Azure Mountain’s pillar. These gifts are… investments.”

Old Lu cut in, “Now pick another artifact as your formal master’s gift!”

Guan Yu marveled—disciple recruitment usually demanded tributes, yet here masters bribed him!

Xuanming urged, “My artifacts outclass his. Choose wisely!”

“We’re not peddlers!” Old Lu shot back.

Guan Yu feigned indecision. “Since I’ve two artifacts already, why not each present your finest? I’ll pick between them.”

Reluctantly, the elders agreed. Xuanming summoned a black broadsword—simple yet thrumming with power. Old Lu produced a sinister-looking incense burner leaking dark smoke.

“Grandpa Lu, is that another demonic artifact?” Guan Yu asked warily.

“No! Its prior owner was demonic, but once bonded, it’ll adapt to your energy,” Old Lu insisted.

Xuanming interjected, “Objectively, both are near-immortal grade. Yet his reeks of malevolence. Mine—the Soul-Severing Blade—is pure.”

Guan Yu studied the blade: unadorned, heavy, radiating lethal intent. The burner pulsed with raw, unsettling power.

Old Lu glared. “Don’t listen to him! This Cauldron of Profound Flames rivals any immortal tool!”

As they argued, Guan Yu smiled. Today’s haul exceeded all expectations.
