Guanyu strode over and declared, “If I’m not mistaken, this must be the matriarch of the Li family? Then Old Master Li must be hiding beneath this coffin, eh? Ah, what a fragrant aroma of wine! Who would have thought Old Master Li would be living quite comfortably under there?”

**Chapter 3053: Spare My Life, Great Lord**

As Guanyu approached the coffin, he immediately detected the sweet scent of aged liquor. Though not a connoisseur himself, the richness of the aroma told him the space below must be stocked with fine wines.

Guanyu disliked alcohol, but Jieyu Zilang, his companion, was an avid enthusiast. The moment the scent hit him, he grew restless. “Wait here, Guanyu,” he urged. “I’ll go down and haul them all up.”

Truthfully, Jieyu Zilang’s primary motive was to investigate the cellar’s wine reserves. The aroma alone had him nearly drooling.

“Patience,” Guanyu replied. “If they’re hiding below, there’s likely no other exit. Let them stew a while longer. Once our reinforcements arrive, we’ll drag them out in front of everyone.”

Guanyu decided to stand guard, ensuring even the mayor’s wife couldn’t slip away. When Old Granny Wang’s funeral procession reached them, he planned to summon the crowd and expose the Li family’s hiding place publicly. By then, the Lis—even if they sprouted wings—would find escape impossible. Mayor Wang, too, would lose all pretext to shield them.

Moreover, this would reveal the mayor’s treachery: his wife had tipped off the Lis, aiding their flight—a blatant breach of protocol. The mayor’s dismissal would surely follow.

Guanyu gestured for Jieyu Zilang to restrain the two women. Neither possessed martial skills. Swiftly, Jieyu Zilang bound them with white cloth. When the matriarch continued shrieking, he gagged her with a strip of fabric.

The commotion above drew another figure from the coffin. Jieyu Zilang’s blade flashed to the newcomer’s throat. “Return below and stay quiet,” he growled, “or lose your head.”

“Y-yes! Spare me, great lord! Have mercy!” The trembling man—young, unidentified—scrambled back into the coffin.

Guanyu peered into the coffin’s hollow interior, noting a staircase descending underground. He turned to the bound matriarch. “How many are down there?”

She glared defiantly, turning her face away.

“Silent, eh?” Guanyu sneered. “Shall I toss you into another coffin? Spend the rest of your days sealed beneath a thousand-pound lid?”

The threat was no bluff. Once entombed, escape would be impossible—a slow death guaranteed.

“Think I won’t?” Guanyu seized her collar, dragging her toward another coffin.

“Help! Murder!” she screamed.

“Scream louder,” Guanyu mocked. “Summon more witnesses. We’ll execute your family publicly.”

“Mercy, great hero!” she pleaded, genuine terror in her voice. “The Li men’s crimes aren’t ours! Spare us women!”

Jieyu Zilang kicked open the adjacent coffin’s lid. Guanyu hoisted her halfway inside before pausing.

Dangling mid-air, she gasped as he demanded again: “How many Lis are below?”

“T-twenty! Please, spare us!”

“Is Li Gui there? His father?”

“The patriarch’s below, but Li Gui vanished! I haven’t seen him!”

Guanyu frowned. Li Gui’s absence suggested Mayor Wang had smuggled him out—likely far beyond the town already.

A distant trumpet’s wail announced the approaching procession. Guanyu flung open the coffin shop’s dilapidated doors, spotting the somber parade. At its head, two youths in mourning clothes scattered paper money. Mayor Wang, centerpiece, clutched a framed photograph of Old Granny Wang.

Spotting Guanyu, the mayor paled. *Had they been discovered?* Despair gripped him—the Lis’ incompetence knew no bounds.

As the procession neared a fork, the mayor barked, “Turn left here. Northward.” Hoping to detour, he aimed to distance himself from the brewing scandal.

But Guanyu intercepted them. “Mayor Wang! Deviating from the plan? The Lis await in mourning garb, ready to blend into your procession. Turn now, and they’ll have nowhere to hide!”

His booming voice halted the musicians. The mayor scowled. “Guanyu! Slander is no trifle! Accusing me of harboring criminals?”

**Chapter 3055: Unearthing the Truth**

“Precisely,” Guanyu stated coldly.

The mayor inwardly cursed his misstep.

Guanyu continued, “Either someone murdered Granny Wang, or every physician here is a fool—incapable of diagnosing fatal illness.”

“Outrageous!” An elderly man with silver hair and a wispy beard stepped forward—the town’s revered physician. “I attended Granny Wang myself. My skills are unmatched here. Your baseless insults shame her memory!”

Guanyu smiled. The old doctor exuded dignity.

“A hypothetical, esteemed sir. Would you share her medical history?”

“Gladly.” The physician stroked his beard—a habitual gesture that kept it neatly tapered.

“Granny Wang was hale until six months ago, when wind-cold fever struck. At her age, even minor ailments turn dire. Through careful treatment, her condition stabilized, though her vitality waned. Last month, she regained independence. Her sudden death defies reason.”

Guanyu whispered to Lin Zhonggeng, urging him to address the crowd.

“Hear this!” Lin proclaimed. “Granny Wang recovered, yet died abruptly. We must uncover the truth—let her rest without grievance!”

The physician added, “I wasn’t allowed to examine the body before encoffinment. This troubles me deeply.”

“We demand an autopsy!” Lin shouted. “Expose the schemers!”

“Blasphemy!” The mayor recoiled. “Disturbing the dead insults her spirit!”

Lin countered, “Burying her with unresolved doubts insults her more! The people will decide!”

Murmurs swelled. “Granny seemed well yesterday...” “She deserves justice...”

The physician nodded gravely. “An autopsy, though improper, may be necessary.”

Guanyu pressed, “To bury her blindly is true disrespect. Her spirit would welcome clarity.”

The mayor’s face twisted. An autopsy meant exposure. Yet the crowd’s will overpowered him.

**Chapter 3056: Flight Without Trace**

“Granny’s encoffined!” the mayor blustered. “Elderly demise is natural! I inspected her home—no signs of struggle or injury!”

“Recall Wu Wenbo’s death,” Guanyu interjected. “No wounds, no struggle—yet the Lis murdered him.”

The crowd seethed, hatred for the Lis reignited.

Lin pressed, “You’re no physician, Mayor. Let the expert decide.”

“Autopsy! Autopsy!” the crowd chanted.

Trapped, the mayor relented, praying no evidence tied him to the crime. Earlier, he’d sent his wife to misdirect pursuers while he strangled Granny Wang. The staged funeral aimed to smuggle the Lis out during the procession.

But Guanyu’s interference ruined everything. The mayor glared, vowing vengeance.

Lin addressed the physician. “Shall we return to her home or use the coffin shop?”

“The shop suffices,” the physician replied.

As the crowd surged forward, the mayor’s scheme unraveled. His fate, and the Lis’, now hung by a thread.
