Lin Dong drove straight to the entrance of Li Xi's villa and parked in the garage. By the time he got out of the car, Li Xi remained seated in the back without moving an inch.

Guan Yu had truly fallen asleep, his head pillowed on Li Xi's thighs, drool continuously trickling from the corner of his mouth as he slept soundly.

Lin Dong merely glanced at the scene, immediately understanding the situation. A faint smile flickered at his lips before he walked away, leaving the two alone in the vehicle.

Li Xi's current state of mind could only be described as a mix of exasperation and acute discomfort. The reason? Guan Yu's drool had thoroughly soaked her thighs.

She gritted her teeth, waiting for Guan Yu to wake naturally.

Yet after a considerable time passed with no sign of him stirring, Li Xi finally reached her limit.

Just as her temper threatened to erupt, she felt a warm palm brush against her thigh. An electric jolt shot through her body.

Guan Yu opened his eyes, rubbed his drowsy face, and rolled over onto his back—only to be greeted by the awe-inspiring sight of two magnificent peaks quivering before him!

But his momentary awe froze when he met Li Xi's icy glare.

Looking down at him, she hissed through clenched teeth, “Get up!”

This downward glance proved catastrophic.

Guan Yu’s nose and mouth were completely smothered by two soft, pillowy mounds pressing against his face.

He swore internally—he hadn’t leaned forward. They’d come to him!

Blame Li Xi’s overwhelmingly generous proportions!

**Chapter 939: Not Bad, Truly Not Bad**

Guan Yu’s face remained buried between Li Xi’s breasts, the thin fabric and soft bra creating an unmistakably real sensation. Neither could believe this absurd situation—Li Xi’s uncharacteristic lapse in judgment, Guan Yu “accidentally” groping her chest again, this time using his head rather than hands.

After a stunned pause, an intense electric thrill surged through them both.

Drawing a deep breath, Guan Yu caught a whiff of delicate fragrance that sharpened his senses.

“Wine doesn’t intoxicate—people intoxicate themselves.” Guan Yu felt utterly drunk, drowning in this unexpected bliss.

Alas, the moment shattered.

Li Xi jerked upright, trembling uncontrollably, her fair cheeks flushed crimson beneath an icy facade. Their eyes met briefly mid-air before her frosty gaze pinned Guan Yu to the seat.

With an internal sigh, Guan Yu’s lingering gaze betrayed his reluctance to part from this heavenly pillow.

He fantasized about nestling between those peaks for a long nap, perhaps even a pleasant erotic dream. But sensing Li Xi’s rising fury, he knew any further “inappropriate advances” would trigger an explosion—consequences even his investigative system couldn’t predict.

Wearing an awkward, sheepish grin, Guan Yu scrambled upright. Scratching his head, he offered lamely, “Got too tired earlier... accidentally fell asleep.”

Despite his words, his eyes strayed irresistibly to Li Xi’s voluptuous chest. A subtle nose-touch—seemingly savoring the recent indulgence—only poured oil on the flames, bleaching Li Xi’s face pale with rage.

Taking advantage was bad enough, but openly ogling her chest afterward? Pure流氓 behavior!

Humiliation and anger boiling over, Li Xi stormed out of the car and marched into the villa, heels clacking sharply.

Guan Yu opened his door but hesitated. Both the morning’s events and tonight’s incident suggested entering now would be unwise—especially with Li Xi’s father Li Yuanshan inside. Their relationship had grown complicated enough.

With a resigned grimace, he withdrew his foot and climbed into the driver’s seat.

But when he tried starting the car—no keys.

Lin Dong had taken them!

Guan Yu’s lips twisted in a bitter smile. “Damn you, Little Linzi! Just wait till my system upgrades—I’ll hang you up and beat you senseless!”

Cursing provided little comfort. Homeless for the night, he shamefacedly rang the villa’s doorbell.

Li Yuanshan answered, beaming. “Xiao Yu! Treating this as your own home warms my heart! If it weren’t so late, we’d share drinks!”

Guan Yu broke into cold sweat. He’d only come to crash here—since when had this become “his home”? Was Li Yuanshan this desperate for a son-in-law?

Though being Li Xi’s husband didn’t sound terrible—nightly embraces and revelry with her... The thought drew a wicked grin.

A sudden chill made him stiffen. Turning, he found Li Xi glaring frostily from the stairs—as if seeing through his lewd thoughts.

Quickly schooling his expression, Guan Yu prayed not to be thrown out immediately.

**Chapter 940: Intentions**

“Xi’er, why didn’t you invite Guan Yu in after he brought you home?” Li Yuanshan chided.

“I did. He declined.” Li Xi replied tonelessly. “I’m tired. Retiring now.”

She ascended without another glance, leaving Guan Yu awkwardly stranded. Karma for earlier offenses.

Though she’d never invited him, her claim of his refusal painted him as a flip-flopping opportunist—which wasn’t entirely wrong, given his earlier antics.

Sighing softly, Guan Yu missed Li Yuanshan misinterpreting it as offense.

“Xi’er’s temperamental—don’t mind her,” the older man apologized.

“If only she wouldn’t mind me,” Guan Yu wryly countered.

“Haha! Spoken like a true man—giving way to women shows breadth of character!” Li Yuanshan clapped his shoulder. “Rest early! Tomorrow I’m treating you—no escapes!”

“Of course,” Guan Yu forced a smile.

“And if you return to the Myanmar jade auctions, count me in! Full support!”

“I likely won’t revisit those,” Guan Yu said honestly. With his detection system, public venues risked exposing his abilities. Moreover, he no longer needed the income.

Li Yuanshan paused, then nodded in realization. Guan Yu’s current stature—surpassing even his own—rendered such ventures unnecessary.

Patting the younger man’s shoulder, he murmured approvingly, “Xiao Yu... not bad. Truly not bad.”

**Chapter 941: Underground Racing**

They say mothers-in-law grow fonder of sons-in-law over time. Sometimes fathers-in-law do too.

Li Yuanshan’s gaze held unmistakable approval—the look reserved for cherished family. Previously valuing Guan Yu’s stone-appraisal skills, he now recognized the young man’s character and latent potential.

Guan Yu squirmed under the scrutiny. “Uncle Li, perhaps we should retire?”

“Right! Your room’s here.” Li Yuanshan led him upstairs, pausing at a door. “Mine’s opposite—call if needed.”

“Thank you.”

“We’re practically family! No formalities.”

As Guan Yu smiled nervously, Li Yuanshan leaned closer conspiratorially: “Xi’er’s room is next door. The walls are soundproof.”

A wink accompanied this outrageous hint.

Guan Yu’s cheek twitched. Tempting as it was, provoking Li Xi guaranteed domestic chaos.

“Goodnight!” He hurried into his room—only to be stopped again.

“No shame between men!” Li Yuanshan insisted. “You didn’t mind my presence in the living room earlier. Pursue her properly—just don’t break her heart.”

Sweating profusely, Guan Yu fled into his room and collapsed on the bed.

A knock interrupted his thoughts. Assuming Li Yuanshan returned, he pretended sleep—until persistence forced him to answer.

The vision at his door banished all fatigue.

Fresh from her bath, Li Xi stood with damp hair cascading over her shoulders, skin glowing pink, lips dewy. Though disappointingly clad in modest pajamas, her natural beauty still stunned.

“Late-night chat?” she asked, breezing past him. “Or are you tired?”

“Not at all!” Guan Yu ushered her in eagerly.

Watching her slender waist sway, he wondered—was misfortune yielding unexpected fortune?

“Discussing how you’ll handle the豪门 syndicate?” Her question doused his excitement.

“That’s... the topic?” He couldn’t hide disappointment.

“What else?”

“Nothing. Your intuition?”

“Precisely. You’ll strike first.”

Guan Yu sighed. “Women’s intuition terrifies.”

“The racing operations in their files,” she pressed. “You mean to disrupt their cash flow?”

“Exactly. Their monthly underground races generate massive revenue. I’ll cripple one event.”

Li Xi’s eyes narrowed. “By participating?”

“By winning.” His gaze turned steely. “Every loss damages their reputation and income. One major upset could trigger cascading failures.”

**Chapter 942: The Plan**

Li Xi studied him. “You’d need insider access. And exceptional skill.”

A slow smile spread across Guan Yu’s face. “Who better than the man who humiliated their enforcers? As for skill...” He tapped his temple. “I’ve got advantages they can’t imagine.”

The detection system’s predictive capabilities made him unbeatable—on track or battlefield.

“Risky,” she cautioned. “They’ll recognize you.”

“Let them.” His voice hardened. “I want them to know it’s me. Let fear erode their confidence before the real battle begins.”

Silence stretched as Li Xi absorbed this. Finally, she nodded. “When?”

“Next event’s in ten days. Enough time to prepare.”

“And after?”

Guan Yu’s smile turned wolfish. “Then we dismantle them piece by piece. Starting with their ‘impenetrable’ security network.”

A shiver ran through Li Xi—not of fear, but anticipation. The hunter had become the hunted, and Guan Yu’s retribution would be merciless.
