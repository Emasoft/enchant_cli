“We’ve come all this way; it would be a waste to leave empty-handed. If we leave now, we might never get another chance. So what if it’s the Swordless Manor? Guan Yu thought even if they barged in, the people here weren’t anything extraordinary.

Just because they have the Swordless Immortal, ranked first under heaven, guarding the place? Even so, they should at least observe basic hospitality. Blocking visitors like this is utterly uncivilized.

Guan Yu believed guests deserved respect. Even if the Swordless Immortal refused challenges, inviting visitors in for tea wouldn’t hurt. To turn travelers away after their long journey—how preposterous!

He glanced at the manor’s walls. They weren’t particularly high. With a leap, he could easily vault over them.

Just then, the gates suddenly swung open. Guan Yu and his companions froze. A middle-aged man in white robes stood inside. Coldly, he declared, “Who dares act so insolently here? We aren’t refusing guests—the manor is occupied. Return another day.”

“We aren’t here to challenge the Swordless Immortal,” Guan Yu retorted. “We merely wish to visit. Is even that unwelcome?”

The white-robed man seemed arrogant, perhaps inflated by the prestige of serving the world’s foremost manor. His narrow eyes—whether naturally small or narrowed in contempt—barely seemed open.

“If you aren’t here to challenge my master, leave. He only receives challengers,” the man snapped, moving to shut the gates.

Du Teng urgently interjected, “The four who came earlier are our friends. We’re here to retrieve them. Please accommodate us.”

Guan Yu scoffed. A mere servant acting so high-and-mighty? Unacceptable. He shoved the gate, halting its closure.

“Brother, we’re merely curious visitors. After traveling so far, won’t you grant us this courtesy?”

The servant glared. “You aren’t welcome here. Wait outside for your friends. My master dislikes your sort. I advise against rash actions.”

As the man tried again to shut the gate, Guan Yu pushed back, their forces clashing through the door.

“Fools! Do you know where you stand?” The servant sneered, noticing Guan Yu’s novice-level cultivation. “Such impudence warrants punishment!”

**Chapter 4139: Blocked at the Gates**

Pushing against the door, the servant lifted his right foot, tracing a circle in the air. Battle qi shot through the gap toward Guan Yu.

Guan Yu stiffened—the man’s skill surpassed expectations. Rumors were true: even servants here were masters.

“Watch out!” Du Teng shouted, fearing Guan Yu would be struck.

Unfazed, Guan Yu stomped, unleashing a shockwave. A crack echoed as their energies collided, blasting half the gate to splinters.

The servant gaped. He’d misjudged—Guan Yu’s power far exceeded his own.

With the gate destroyed, the servant hissed, “You dare defile the Swordless Manor’s reputation?”

Footsteps approached. Four more experts emerged. Guan Yu tensed—if more arrived, retreat might be necessary.

Wang Xiaorong could fight under Guan Yu’s protection, but Zhenxiang and Du Teng were vulnerable. Restraint was prudent.

Du Teng stepped forward, smiling placatingly. “Our apologies. We’ll repair the gate and compensate you. My friend here is... impulsive.”

“Leaving is no longer an option,” the servant spat. “Apologize and pay.”

Guan Yu tossed a gold ingot. “Here. We came respectfully, yet your gatekeeper insulted us. Is this how the Swordless Immortal teaches hospitality?”

“Clowns!” Another servant jabbed a finger. “You think this manor welcomes riffraff?”

Du Teng interjected, “We admire the Swordless Immortal. Having traveled so far, grant us passage.”

A different servant explained, “None enter without the master’s invitation. Challengers must first defeat us.”

“Even if we beat you, the Swordless Immortal might still refuse?” Guan Yu frowned. The rules felt arbitrary.

Wang Xiaorong scoffed, “Compensate? What’s a broken gate worth? Don’t fuss over trifles.”

“You misunderstand,” the servant said. “Only by defeating one of us may a challenger petition the master. He may still decline.”

Guan Yu assessed the four opponents—each Du Teng’s equal. With Wang Xiaorong’s spells and crossbow, victory was possible, but Zhenxiang needed protection.

“Let’s fight four against four,” Guan Yu proposed. “If we win, let us pass.”

The servants exchanged glances. “Fools! Those unworthy die here. Attack!”

**Chapter 4140: A Headshot**

As five servants lunged, Guan Yu intercepted three. Du Teng engaged one, while Wang Xiaorong chanted. Black mire erupted beneath two attackers, trapping them.

Zhenxiang summoned lightning, striking the ensnared men. Another servant broke free to rescue them, but Guan Yu barred his path.

“Surrender now,” Guan Yu demanded, “and we’ll spare you.”

Three servants redirected toward Wang Xiaorong. A gale of razor-edged leaves forced them back, but one brute charged through.

Wang Xiaorong raised her crossbow—point-blank, the bolt pierced his skull.

“Underestimate this ‘riffraff’ again,” she spat, reloading, “and learn harder lessons.”

**Chapter 4141: The Maze**

Du Teng gaped at the smoldering corpse. “This... breaks all protocols!”

Guan Yu grinned fiercely. “Protocols? Today, we rewrite them.”

The remaining servants faltered. Their leader snarled, “Activate the formation!”

The courtyard’s tiles shifted, enveloping the intruders in mist. Guan Yu cursed—they’d walked into a trap.

“Stay close!” he barked. “This maze reeks of illusion qi.”

Wang Xiaorong nocked another bolt. “Let’s see whose tricks outlast whose.”

Somewhere in the fog, laughter echoed. The true test had begun.
