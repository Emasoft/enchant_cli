The sight caused Liu Yunjie to narrow his eyes. Suddenly, as if remembering something, he blurted out: “Are you Guan Yu?”

He had been wondering all along—who was this person walking so closely with Jiang Ziqi? Only now did it strike him: wasn’t this the mastermind behind the downfall of the Hao Clan?

To ordinary folk, the collapse of the Hao Clan might mean little. But for those in the upper echelons, it had been a detonator. Its destruction had plunged the capital’s power dynamics into chaos, tearing apart once-covert feuds between aristocratic families and factions. The overt and covert struggles had kept him, the Secretary of Political and Legal Affairs, perpetually uneasy.

As the head of the political-legal system, Liu Yunjie naturally understood how the Hao Clan fell. Yet he never imagined the architect would be this unremarkable young man before him. No wonder he looked so familiar.

Since the Hao Clan’s demise, Guan Yu had drawn intense scrutiny from the upper circles. Liu Yunjie was no exception—his office contained several dossiers on the young man.

His earlier failure to recognize Guan Yu stemmed from sheer disbelief that this ordinary-looking youth could be the one who forced the Hao Clan into retreat!

Unaware of Liu’s thoughts, Guan Yu snorted at his stunned expression: “What’s with the theatrics? And you call yourself the Secretary of Political and Legal Affairs!”

The patronizing tone made Liu frown. He gave an uncharacteristically silent huff.

The meal proceeded smoothly, though several attendees remained tremblingly mute throughout. The old patriarch showed no sympathy—after decades, he knew his sons’ true colors. This was a perfect opportunity to teach them a lesson.

Though Liu Yunjie hadn’t sunk to his brothers’ level, his situation wasn’t much better. Despite years in the political-legal system and his current high position, without greater backing, he’d remain stagnant for another decade.

Had he taken a stance regarding Guan Yu earlier, he might have climbed higher through the young man’s influence. Now, the chance was lost. An inexplicable sense of twilight heroism washed over him.

Post-lunch, during the patriarch’s nap, Guan Yu and Jiang Ziqi retreated to the courtyard.

“Why?” Guan Yu lit a cigarette, features obscured by swirling smoke.

Jiang Ziqi, anticipating the question, mirrored his action: “Drawn by your charm. Would joining your camp work?”

“Fuck off! I don’t swing that way!” Guan Yu kicked Jiang’s rear.

Instead of anger, Jiang exhaled relief—the crude response signaled acceptance.

“I resented being controlled. I’m the Jiang family’s future heir.”

Guan Yu nodded. “What changed?”

“Fate, perhaps. Zhou Yu lamented that Heaven had blessed him with unparalleled intelligence, only to send down a Zhuge Liang who surpassed him in every way, ultimately leading to his early demise from sheer frustration. I’d rather not die young... you understand.” Sensing Guan Yu’s eased guard, Jiang’s tone relaxed.

“Bullshit! Just spit it out instead of beating around the bush!” Guan Yu snapped.

“Our ambitions differ. I hope... someday, Young Master Guan will assist me.” Jiang’s expression turned solemn.

Guan Yu fell silent. He knew Jiang’s meaning—the risks were immense. Taking a final drag, he ground out the cigarette: “I can’t promise that yet.”

“Understood.” Jiang hadn’t expected immediate agreement. Glancing indoors, he smirked: “To show sincerity—Li Xi is having tea with someone who’s pursued her five years.”

“What’s that to me?” Guan Yu scoffed, though inwardly seethed: Which bastard dares poach my territory? I’ll end him.

That afternoon, after checking the patriarch’s health and briefing Wenqing, Guan Yu headed to the International Trade Center café—the same spot where Huang Zhongxing had once kidnapped Li Xi.

Entering, he spotted Li Xi in a corner booth, facing a well-dressed bespectacled man. Her faint smile twisted his gut.

Striding over, he plopped beside her: “Weren’t you preparing for Taiwan? Since when do you café lounge?”

Startled, Li Xi stammered: “Guan Yu! Why are you here?”

“Last I checked, this isn’t your family’s property.” His tone turned sharp—how dare she sneak off for dates?

Though their relationship remained undefined, Guan Yu already considered her his girlfriend. This scene irked him.

“Sir, you’re in the wrong seat,” the bespectacled man interjected.

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes: “Deaf or blind? Can’t see I’m talking with my girlfriend? You’re the intruder here.”

The man paled: “Xi’er... he’s really your boyfriend?”

Guan Yu shuddered—Xi’er? Even I don’t use such saccharine terms!

Li Xi flushed crimson, regaining composure only for Guan Yu to yank her into his arms: “Would I hold her if I weren’t?”

“Guan Yu! Let go!” She squirmed.

“Why the fuss, wifey? We’re practically old married folks.” Guan Yu tightened his grip—releasing her now would expose his bluff.

“Old married?!” She laughed bitterly: “Release me or I’ll scream assault!”

“Scream away.” He remained unfazed—this wasn’t actual harassment.

Exasperated, Li Xi pinched his waist: “Let. Go.”

Initially defiant, Guan Yu finally yelped: “Okay! Releasing!”

Satisfied, Li Qi smirked triumphantly.

Watching their flirtatious quarrel, Song Qifeng’s ears burned red. Years in business had schooled his composure.

“Xi’er, won’t you introduce this... male friend?”

“I’m her boyfr—” Guan Yu began, cut short by Li Xi’s glare.

“Qifeng, this is Guan Yu. My business partner... and friend.”

Guan Yu? Song’s eyes flashed—could it be that man? Regardless, anyone competing for Li Xi would pay.

Masking his fury, Song extended a hand: “Pleasure. Song Qifeng.”
