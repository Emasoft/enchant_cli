Murong Shan’s astonishment was understandable. The magical skills ordinary people used were essentially structured techniques—specific sequences infused with particular elemental energies. Yet Guan Yu defied convention entirely. Without any formal method, he directly gathered elemental forces from the air through sheer will, shaping them into a peculiar substance hovering between light and solid form.

Guan Yu had no idea how extraordinary this was. He resorted to elemental gathering simply because he knew only two low-tier techniques, neither of which helped him improve.

“Since it’s formed by condensing air elements, let’s call it the **Qi-Converging Blade**!”

Guan Yu glanced at the wary Murong Shan and muttered, “Not sure if this’ll work. You’ll make a good test subject!”

With that, his left hand shot up, a blinding white light flashing into Murong Shan’s eyes. In the momentary distraction, Guan Yu lunged forward, the qi blade in his right hand morphing rapidly as multiple streaks of light lashed toward his opponent.

Caught off guard, Murong Shan missed his chance to dodge. He hastily raised his Mystic Iron Sword to block.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The ear-splitting clashes left Murong Shan’s palms bloodied. Before he could recover, Guan Yu struck again. To his shock, the ethereal qi blade proved mightier than his prized sword. By the time he registered the second attack, evasion was impossible. He raised his sword once more—

*Crack!*

The Mystic Iron Sword shattered under Guan Yu’s strike, the impact hurling Murong Shan meters back until he crumpled to the ground.

Two moves. That was all it took for Guan Yu to fell the notoriously arrogant Murong Shan, leaving every onlooker stunned.

To them, the battle-hardened Murong Shan had been an invincible surety, while Guan Yu was merely a boastful youth. Now, reality upended their assumptions. Guan Yu had proven his strength beyond doubt.

“Old man,” Guan Yu jeered, “retire quietly. Don’t waste your dwindling years picking fights with the young—you’ll only break faster.”

With three mocking laughs, he grabbed Xia Yue’er’s hand and leaped away, vanishing from sight.

“Master, shall we pursue?” guards asked, but Murong Shan waved them off. “Let him go. You can’t stop him.”

“But… should we just let this slide?”

Murong Shan spat blood, his smile icy. “Do you think I, Murong Shan, forgive those who harm me? Sooner or later, that reckless fool will pay a bloody price. And I doubt he’ll have to wait long.”

“Understood. We’ll monitor his movements closely.”

**Chapter 1274: All a Misunderstanding**

Seeing her uncle’s furious, disheveled state, Murong Li shuddered. The young man had clearly struck a nerve no one dared touch.

*Please never return,* she prayed silently, staring at the horizon where Guan Yu had disappeared.

After fleeing the Murong estate, Guan Yu and Xia Yue’er returned to their inn as dawn’s first star glimmered in the east.

“Almost sunrise… Ugh, I’m exhausted. Goodnight!” Xia Yue’er yawned, trudging to her room.

Though not tired, Guan Yu decided to rest for the days ahead. He awoke at dusk, sunlight slanting through the window. After dressing, he went to check on Xia Yue’er.

Knocking brought no response. “Still asleep?” he wondered, pushing the door open—only to find the room empty.

“Dammit, has this little minx run off again?”

He recalled her previous escape after he’d rescued her, but this time, he needed her help to find the Crystal Toad.

“What’re you doing, you creep? Snooping through my room?”

Xia Yue’er’s indignant voice rang behind him.

“I wasn’t snooping! And I’ve told you—my name’s **Guan Yu**, not ‘creep.’ Call me that again, and you’ll regret it!”

“Oh, why wait? I already regret bringing food back for someone so ungrateful!” She produced two plump chicken legs and skewers from behind her back. “Guess these’ll have to go to the dogs.”

Guan Yu’s stomach growled. Swallowing pride, he mumbled, “Uh… Xia Yue… That was a misunderstanding…”

She huffed. “Misunderstanding? You hate me, I hate you. Let’s split up now. I know where Tigerhead Mountain is anyway—”

She’d struck his weak point. Guan Yu’s mission was the Crystal Toad, rumored to emerge near Tigerhead Mountain in a day. But as an outsider, navigating the wilderness alone would be impossible.

“Enough! I surrender. You win, alright?”

For Guan Yu to concede, Xia Yue’er was clearly formidable. Once calling him “Brother Yu,” she now flip-flopped between endearments and insults, her capriciousness a constant thorn—yet he couldn’t afford to lose her.

---

After hours of bickering, they set out for Tigerhead Mountain at nightfall.

“The Crystal Toad appears tonight under the full moon. We’ll reach the mountain before dark.”

Xia Yue’er hesitated. “It’s over a hundred *li* away, through forests and hills. Think we’ll make it?”

Guan Yu nearly choked. “A hundred *li*? Why didn’t you say sooner?!”

“You never asked! Relax, I lied. It’s barely ten *li*.”

His mood swung from despair to relief. On flat ground, they could cover dozens of *li* in an hour, but terrain would slow them.

They departed immediately, reaching Tigerhead Mountain in two hours. The peak lived up to its name, resembling a tiger’s head. As dusk deepened, a full moon rose, luminous as jade.

“What a stunning moon,” Guan Yu marveled.

Xia Yue’er giggled. “Thanks for the compliment!”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. Her whimsy was endless, as if she’d been raised by bandits.

---

A rustle alerted them. Guan Yu climbed a tree, spotting torch-bearing groups searching the area.

“They’re all here for the Crystal Toad!”

More torches flickered in the distance. “So much for secrecy,” he muttered.

Suddenly, the crowd surged toward them. At the mountaintop, a glimmering crystal flickered.

“What was that?” Guan Yu asked.

“The Crystal Toad, obviously!” Xia Yue’er scoffed. “Hurry!”

He leaped down as the crowd neared. Among them was a sickly man—Murong Li’s brother, Murong Ziming.

“You again,” Guan Yu said coldly.

Murong Ziming’s pallid face tightened. “So you’ve been to our estate. I hear you injured an elder.”

Before Guan Yu retorted, shouts erupted. The Crystal Toad reappeared—but beside it, Xia Yue’er held a luminous mirror, its glow rivaling the moon.

Seizing the distraction, Guan Yu lunged, grasping the Crystal Toad. A soothing coolness seeped into his veins—unlike anything he’d ever felt.

The crowd erupted, demanding the toad. Guan Yu knew staying meant disaster.

As he prepared to flee, a voice shouted, “Yue’er! What are you doing here?”

Xia Yue’er pouted, approaching the speaker. “I… just wanted to explore…”

“Unfair!” someone yelled. “Hand over the toad!”

**Chapter 1275: Secured**

Amid the chaos, Guan Yu tightened his grip on the Crystal Toad. Xia Yue’er’s mirror had been a gamble, but it worked. Now, survival depended on speed.

“You think you can take it?” Guan Yu challenged the mob, backing toward the forest edge.

Murong Ziming stepped forward, magic flickering at his fingertips. “That toad belongs to the Murong family.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Prove it.”

A surge of energy crackled between them as the crowd closed in.
