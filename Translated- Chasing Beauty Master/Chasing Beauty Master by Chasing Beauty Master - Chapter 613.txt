“City Lord! This subordinate has failed in his duty! I lost track of her!” Ming knelt in the Demon Hall reporting to the Demon City Lord. “However, I discovered she not only possesses dramatically enhanced talents, but also...” He deliberately paused, awaiting a reaction. “But also what?!”

...

“She’s a multi-elementalist!” Ming declared loudly, successfully provoking the City Lord’s astonishment.

The Demon City Lord instantly flew before Ming. “A multi-elementalist?!”

“Correct! From what I’ve ascertained, she wields wind, earth, and metal elements!”

**Chapter 1555: The Dark Element**

To the mortal world, he too was a terrifying existence. In the moment Chimei (Mountain Spirit) froze in distraction, Guan Yu scooped it up and carried it toward the dilapidated hut—a bizarre sight resembling beauty paired with beast.

Over the following days, Guan Yu cultivated as usual, mastering the Soul-Devouring Whip’s properties and uncovering Chimei’s origins. Chimei could be called the first “adorable” direbeast in history. According to its inherited memories, its kind were universally feared by humanity. How had it become “cute” under her care? *Ah! My once-formidable reputation!* Chimei lamented inwardly. But what could it do? She was its master!

Guan Yu chuckled at Chimei’s ever-shifting expressions. The creature stared transfixed by her smile. Had fate not forged her through hardship, what a beautiful, carefree maiden she might have been!

“Chimei! From now on, we’re companions. Call me Guan Yu.” The beast nodded woodenly. Guan Yu gazed skyward, silently vowing: *Father, Mother... I’ve gained another ally.*

Sensing her thoughts, Chimei crawled to Guan Yu’s feet, nuzzling comfort. Guan Yu lifted it, playfully tousling its fur. In truth, she felt their kinship—both lonely souls. And yes, it *was* rather endearing... save for those fangs.

The next dawn, Guan Yu awoke blearily to find Chimei sleeping peacefully in her arms. A smile graced her lips. Yet in this Demon City, how could she survive? Hiding forever wasn’t an option. She resolved to test her limits.

Storing Chimei within the Soul-Devouring Whip, Guan Yu walked the streets alone—immediately drawing demonic attention.

“It’s that human!”

“The Asura!”

...

Demons murmured as Guan Yu passed, her expression deathly calm—a reaper poised to harvest lives. *This truly is a world where strength reigns supreme,* she mused. *Only the powerful survive.* She traversed the entire market unchallenged. None dared provoke her. Such was the power of might.

**Chapter 1556: Beauty and the Beast**

Guan Yu studied the inner city gates. *Only Saint Sovereigns may enter?* With her current strength, breaching them wasn’t impossible. Presently, she could contend with any Saint Sovereign—save perhaps Highblade Saint Sovereign.

After idly wandering, she returned to the ruined hut. The outer city’s vulgarity repelled her—demons brawling openly, couples copulating violently in streets while onlookers cheered. As a maiden, such obscenity overwhelmed her. Another moment there might drive her to slaughter them all.

Chimei’s voice resonated mentally, unusually grave: *“This is the demon realm—pure carnality. To survive here, you must adapt.”* The warning struck home. Survival required becoming demonic herself.

“I know,” Guan Yu replied icily.

Days passed. Unnoticed, half a month elapsed in the Demon City’s underbelly. Guan Yu adopted a hunter’s rhythm—cultivating by day, stalking prey by night. Daily, demon corpses littered alleys, spreading paranoia through the ranks.

The name “Asura” spread like wildfire—synonymous with merciless slaughter. Guan Yu cared not for repute. Her sole desire: grow stronger. By day she trained; by night hunted. Her strength permitted free passage beyond city walls to forage, refusing demonic diets of flesh and blood. Unbeknownst to her, every move was watched.

Today, Guan Yu stood before inner gates, staring at towering walls with a cryptic smile. Yes—today she would breach them.

Locking eyes with the gatekeeper demon, she coldly declared: “I’m entering.” The guard shuddered. “You’re the Asura?!” He’d anticipated her eventual challenge—but not this soon.

Steeling himself, he nodded. Guan Yu crouched panther-like, poised to strike. The demon raised his weapon, senses heightened. Instinct warned this girl was dangerous.

His intuition proved correct—rewarded only with death. Guan Yu vanished before his eyes. Before he could react, she materialized behind him, golden energy swirling about her legs. A spinning kick smashed him down. Appearing before him again, she snapped his neck—slaying a Saint Sovereign-tier demon in two moves. Terrifying efficiency.

Wiping viridian blood from her hands, Guan Yu entered the inner city. Weeks of honing combat instincts enabled this ease. Within the Demon Hall, the City Lord watched gates part. “She’s finally come.”

**Chapter 1557: Demon City**

The inner city differed starkly—less chaotic but equally depraved. Guan Yu witnessed demons violating a shrieking maiden while crowds chanted “Kill her!” Nearby, another disheveled girl undulated against a demon, eyes glazed with lust. As Guan Yu progressed, such scenes multiplied until abruptly halting. A chorus arose: “A human!”

Demons swarmed, sniffing Guan Yu hungrily. “True human!” One lunged teeth-first. Guan Yu sidestepped, flipping him over her shoulder. As she moved for the kill, a voice boomed: “Halt! No killing here!”

Guan Yu looked up at the newcomer—a demonic man radiating authority. Reluctantly, she released her prey. Other demons bowed reverently as the man blasted her attacker flying with a palm strike. *Impressive power,* Guan Yu noted.

“Welcome to the inner city, human,” the man intoned.

“I am Asura,” Guan Yu replied.

A shrill cry interrupted: “You!” All turned to see an exposedly dressed beauty—Wu Yuying, whom Guan Yu had encountered in the outer city.

Recognition dawned. “Auntie! Half a month apart, and you’ve aged decades!” Guan Yu feigned sorrow.

“Auntie?!” The crowd erupted in laughter. Given demons’ longevity (often millennia), Wu Yuying’s century-plus age compared to Guan Yu’s mere decade made the title apt. Humiliated, Wu Yuying sputtered helplessly.

The demon man commanded: “Human! Apologize!”

“You order me?” Guan Yu’s gaze turned lethal.

“Did I err? Then pray tell, honored auntie—what’s your venerable age?” Guan Yu batted innocent eyes. Trapped, Wu Yuying couldn’t answer without cementing the label.

Chimei’s mental laughter echoed: *“Master, I never knew you had this side!”*

“Laugh again and I’ll toss you out!” Guan Yu threatened.

The demon man persisted: “Apologize!”

“I said: don’t command me.”

Wu Yuying screeched: “Dare join the Trials! Face me there!”

“Trials where only death awaits losers,” the man added.

Intrigued, Guan Yu agreed.

Wu Yuying sneered: “Scared?”

“If even an aunt dares, why wouldn’t I?”

Enraged, Wu Yuying clung to the demon man. “Diya! Avenge me!”

Diya glared. “I’ll await you in the Trials.”

At registration, the clerk sneered: “Name?”

“Asura.”

“Age?”

...

Receiving her token marked “Asura—Deicide Residence,” Guan Yu walked away. Diya called: “I’ll be waiting!”

Thus began her path through the Demon Trials.
