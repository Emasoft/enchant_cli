He halted his steps, gazing directly at Zhao Jinger with tenderness. "I know Jingjing is concerned for me," he said softly, "but what must come will come. Remaining passive does me no good. Moreover, my main purpose in coming to the capital is to attend a charity gala—an event I absolutely cannot miss. I plan to stay here accompanying Jingjing and the Old Chief for two days before handling my own affairs."

Seeing the solemn determination on Guan Yu's face, Zhao Jinger knew persuasion was futile. She looked at him imploringly. "Then take me with you when you go out, brother?"

Guan Yu shook his head without hesitation. "Too dangerous. Having you by my side would only hinder me. Don't worry—I go to resolve troubles, not seek them. Besides," he added with a faint smile, "who says he's necessarily stronger than me? I still need to treat Jingjing's illness. How could I leave you so easily?"

"Enough of this," Guan Yu said, patting his stomach. "Hasn't the dining place arrived yet? I'm starving."

Pouting with exaggerated injury, Zhao Jinger released his arm like a petulant child and strode ahead to lead the way.

Watching her retreating figure, Guan Yu rubbed his nose in amusement.

This girl—still so childish.

**Chapter 413: Do I Look Like a Construction Worker?**

Following Zhao Jinger's brisk pace, they soon arrived at a building resembling a luxury hotel. Though only seven stories tall, its opulent exterior rivaled five-star establishments elsewhere.

Two stone-faced soldiers stood rigidly at the entrance. Guan Yu glanced doubtfully at Zhao Jinger. "You're sure we're eating here?" he asked, gesturing at the guarded doorway.

Still simmering, Zhao Jinger retorted, "It's the only place with food here. Unless you'd rather venture outside immediately?"

Guan Yu sighed. Was avoiding her company worth this icy treatment?

"Doesn't this seem... overly formal?" he persisted. "Perhaps we should return home. I'll cook—you're in for a treat."

This was Zhongnanhai—the compound where state leaders resided and worked. The diners here were people Guan Yu had only seen on television. The thought of entering made him profoundly uncomfortable.

Zhao Jinger rolled her eyes. "You think I want to eat here? Grandpa never dines at home, so our kitchen's empty. We'll make do here tonight and restock tomorrow."

With a resigned shrug, Guan Yu acquiesced. As he hesitated at the threshold, two men in expensive Armani suits brushed past them.

The more handsome of the pair—arrogance etched in his features—did a double-take at Zhao Jinger's fresh beauty. Calculating eyes concealed predatory interest. What a conquest this naïve flower would make. The imagined conquest already brought a smug curl to his lips.

Though well-hidden, Guan Yu's enhanced perception caught the man's vile intentions. A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes.

The stranger suddenly shivered under Guan Yu's gaze but regained composure upon noting his attire. "Since when do construction workers frequent this place?" he sneered to his companion, voice dripping with contempt.

The insult hung in the air. Guan Yu's outfit—clean tracksuit paired with dusty, worn sneakers—did resemble a laborer's. No such visitor had ever been seen here.

Guan Yu ignored the provocation. Better avoid unnecessary trouble for Zhao Zilong. But having sensed the man's designs on Zhao Jinger, he remained vigilant.

Zhao Jinger, however, flushed with indignation. "How dare they—" she began, only to be restrained by Guan Yu.

"Clowns aren't worth our attention," he murmured.

The insult carried. The handsome man whirled around, finger jabbing at Guan Yu. "You called me a clown?!"

His companion pulled him away. "Don't lower yourself."

In Zhongnanhai's political snake pit, behind-the-scenes power games were routine. These strangers clearly didn't recognize Zhao Jinger—a fatal miscalculation.

"Apologies," a guard blocked the Armani duo. "Tonight's banquet is restricted. No unauthorized entries."

The handsome man bristled. "Do we look unauthorized?!"

"Let it go, Yang Yi," his companion said. "We'll dine elsewhere." As they retreated, Guan Yu chuckled at their theatrics.

"Tell me truthfully—do I resemble a construction worker?" he asked Zhao Jinger.

She pretended to scrutinize him. "Now that you mention it..."

Guan Yu flicked her forehead. "Brat! Mocking your elder brother?"

Rubbing her head, Zhao Jinger giggled. "Just joking! You're dashing in anything. They're blind."

"Better." Guan Yu preened mock-seriously. "Since we can't enter, let's find another venue."

**Chapter 414: Fountain?**

Reading Zhao Jinger's hesitation, Guan Yu pressed, "We'll stay nearby. That assassin wouldn't dare strike here. If you're worried, have your grandfather send escorts."

"But Uncle Fang said he's dangerous..."

"Numbers overwhelm skill. Don't you trust your grandfather's arrangements?"

Relenting, Zhao Jinger called Fang Zhe. Thirty minutes later, five elite guards arrived—far superior to her previous protection detail.

Their leader, Tian Xun, saluted. "We'll handle security discreetly. Avoid crowded areas."

As the team melted into the surroundings, Guan Yu marveled at their invisibility. Reassured, they headed to a nearby five-star hotel.

The lobby's marble floors and classical décor—ink paintings and blue-white porcelain—contrasted sharply with Guan Yu's memories of sleeping on corn sacks and subsisting on stale buns.

"A private room, please," Zhao Jinger requested. A hostess guided them past VIP suites when fate intervened—a drunken Yang Yi stumbled from a doorway.

Reeking of alcohol, the man clutched Guan Yu's shoulder as his stomach rebelled. Guan Yu's enhanced reflexes kicked in. A gravity-assisted kick snapped Yang Yi's jaw upward—redirecting the vomit fountain back onto its source.

The putrid splash drew horrified gasps. Guan Yu swept Zhao Jinger to safety as Yang Yi collapsed, howling through ruined features.

Emerging from the suite, Yang Yang inspected his brother's injuries before fixing Guan Yu with venomous eyes. "You'll regret this, laborer trash."

**Chapter 416: Raised on Excrement?**

Military boots echoed through the corridor. A boisterous voice boomed: "Who dares strike my nephew?!"

The bulldog-faced officer—Yang Qian—glared at the only possible culprit. Guan Yu met his bluster with bored disdain.

"Uncle Yang, he's the one!" Yang Yi slurred through swollen lips.

Yang Qian's face purpled. "You dare ignore me, boy?!"

Guan Yu turned to Zhao Jinger. "Doesn't this uncle waste breath stating the obvious?"

"Absolutely," she agreed solemnly.
