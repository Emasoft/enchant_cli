This was a large entertainment establishment, housing not only a brothel that served as paradise for men but also a casino.

Xiao Zhi pointed and said, “Since we’d just be sleeping if we return, why not go inside? It’s bound to be lively.”

Wang Jun thought it reasonable. *Might as well take a look. Gambling a few rounds tonight wouldn’t hurt.* Upon entering, they were struck by the sheer size of the place. Every corner buzzed with activity, the staff overwhelmed by patrons, leaving no time to attend to newcomers.

The main floor was divided by a partition with a bar-like counter where two attendants stood. Behind them lay the casino, its raucous cheers audible from afar—clearly, everyone was having a grand time.

“Let’s join the fun!” Xiao Zhi urged.

But as they approached, the attendants stopped them, explaining weapons were prohibited and must be stored. Wang Jun carried a hand crossbow, while Xiao Zhi had precious magical artifacts—neither wished to part with their belongings.

Given frequent disputes in casinos, especially from desperate losers, such rules existed. Wang Jun discreetly slipped the attendants silver ingots, smiling. “We’re just here for amusement. Please accommodate us.”

The attendants, dazzled by his generosity, grinned and waved them through.

Inside, every imaginable game unfolded. Wealthy patrons in finery lounged in prime seats, beauties at their sides, while impoverished gamblers clutched their stakes, faces etched with fear. The leftmost crowd gathered around a dice table—the simplest game, betting on high or low, though Wang Jun avoided it, suspecting trickery.

The right side hosted *pai gow*, a game of luck and subtle strategy. Stakes reset when the dealer won or lost a set amount, endlessly cycling as long as silver flowed. Other diversions included odd-even guessing, cricket fights, and chess matches—a gambler’s paradise.

After surveying, Wang Jun still found dice simplest. “Give me the silver scraps you earned earlier,” Xiao Zhi said. “I’ll bet on high.”

Wang Jun scoffed. “This silver’s mine. Why should I share?”

“I helped earlier! Can’t you spare some? What kind of friend are you?”

Though Zheng Shouzhuo had given Xiao Zhi funds, he’d left them with Guan Yu in haste. Wang Jun relented, tossing him two silver scraps. “Two taels. Small bets entertain; large ones ruin. Maybe you’ll turn this into two hundred.”

Xiao Zhi grimaced. “Two measly taels? One per bet—two chances at best.”

Leaving Xiao Zhi, Wang Jun wandered to chess tables. A crowd surrounded a *wuziqi* (Five-in-a-Row) endgame puzzle. Solving it earned five taels, but attempting cost one. A man paid, claiming he’d need five moves. The dealer, knowing a three-step solution, indulged him.

After three futile moves, the man conceded. Intrigued but clueless about chess, Wang Jun turned back—only to spot a striking youth entering: over six feet tall, impeccably dressed, with features so exquisite Wang Jun wondered if they were a woman in disguise.

The newcomer’s gaze swept the room, lingering on wealthy targets. *A thief*, Wang Jun realized. He pretended nonchalance, angling for a vantage point.

The thief gravitated toward a boisterous cricket fight. A middle-aged man, arm around a beauty, cursed his losing streak. “Fetch my King Tyrant! I’ll turn this around!”

As the man bellowed, the thief’s slender hand—almost feminine—darted into his robe, snatching a wad of banknotes with practiced ease.

“He took the silver!” Xiao Zhi hissed. “Let’s grab him!”

Wang Jun restrained him. “Rashness will backfire. Wait.”

The thief caught Wang Jun’s stare and smirked, sauntering out. They pursued, but the thief’s long legs outpaced them through winding alleys. Cornered at last, the thief whipped out a dagger, pressing it to Wang Jun’s throat.

“Release me!” The voice was unmistakably female.

Wang Jian froze. *A woman!* “Easy now! I’m no constable. Just... curious.”

“Why chase me?”

“Your skills impressed me. And...” He forced a grin. “Finder’s fee?”

The thief snorted but lowered the blade. “You’ve nerve. What’s your name?”

“Wang Jun. And you?”

She sheathed the dagger. “None of your concern.” With a flicker of movement, she vanished into the shadows, leaving Wang Jun breathless and intrigued.
