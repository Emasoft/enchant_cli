For the art school, these were undoubtedly two tremendous joyous events, which delighted the president beyond measure.

Under the president's instructions and accompanied by key school administrators, Zhou Bo and Liu Ye were invited to a celebratory banquet.

After exiting the gymnasium, Zhou Bo glanced around, seemingly failing to spot the person he hoped to see. Turning to the president, he smiled: "Old Gao, where's Guan Yu? Let's call him along!"

"Guan Yu?" Gao Chengjun was taken aback. "You mean tonight's host?"

"Exactly, him!" Zhou Bo nodded.

"Indeed, we mustn't forget him. Guan Yu's contributions to the centennial celebration's success were indispensable," Liu Ye chimed in.

Gao Chengjun's expression turned somewhat awkward, suspecting Zhou Bo still harbored resentment over Guan Yu's earlier embarrassment to him.

Knowing Guan Yu had overstepped boundaries yet recognizing his contributions to campus discipline, Gao Chengjun found himself torn between protecting the student and placating authority.

With a forced smile, Gao Chengjun said: "I suspect the lad's occupied. Shouldn't we allow young people their romantic pursuits?"

The men present shared knowing chuckles at the implication.

"With a superstar confessing to him, that boy's probably celebrating. Let's excuse him today!" Zhou Bo laughed, following Gao Chengjun to dinner.

Gao Chengjun sighed inwardly with bitter amusement.

Noticing Zhou Bo's ambiguous attitude toward Guan Yu, the president shook his head in frustration.

"That boy's no obedient soul. We'll handle matters as they come," he mused.

At the banquet hall, an empty seat drew Zhou Bo's attention. "Old Gao, where's your secretary?"

"Sent to fetch Guan Yu. Delayed by something, perhaps," Gao Chengjun explained.

"Oh? His importance surpasses ours now?" Zhou Bo remarked pointedly.

Before tensions escalated, the door burst open to reveal Wang Dachui - disheveled, muddy, and battered.

Zhou Bo slammed his chopsticks, displeasure evident. Gao Chengjun's attempts to dismiss Wang proved futile as the secretary insisted on airing grievances against Guan Yu.

"Principal, the assailant was our own student host - Guan Yu!"

As accusations flew, Zhou Bo interjected calmly: "Brother, a word of advice - treat this matter as nonexistent."

Under Zhou's meaningful gaze, Gao Chengjun realized Guan Yu's untouchable status. "He's not someone we can afford to offend. Your career's stability depends on staying clear of him."

Meanwhile, Wenya rushed home through dark slum alleys after visiting her mother, unaware of impending danger.

The night that witnessed Wenya's artistic triumph turned ominous as she vanished into the lightless labyrinth of poverty-stricken streets, her whispered fears swallowed by oppressive darkness...
