The onlookers seemed to hold their breaths. The Right Envoy nearly wept with anxiety, yet remained helplessly entangled in battle, unable to rescue Wang Xiaorong.

Even if he could break free, his own strength would likely prove insufficient to withstand the spells unleashed by Sun Lianzi and the elders. Not only would he fail to save anyone, but he might also perish alongside them.

On the other flank, Chief Lu noticed the predicament. Though he wished to aid Guan Yu, his magical duel with the Soul Demon Sect left him equally immobilized.

The Demon Sovereign grew increasingly frantic, yet Xuan Ming denied him even a moment's respite. Bellowing through clenched teeth, he roared, "Sun Lianzi! If even a hair on Rong'er's head is harmed, I'll skin you alive!"

This momentary distraction proved costly. Xuan Ming's fist smashed into the Demon Sovereign's chest, sending him hurtling through the air in a spray of blood before crashing heavily to the ground.

Hearing the Demon Sovereign's threat, Sun Lianzi merely sneered. Bloodlust clouded his vision – with Guan Yu eliminated, the East Sea Dragon Pearl would be his. As the Cloud Azure Sect and Soul Demon Sect remained locked in stalemate, his Red Lotus Sect could emerge victorious through careful maneuvering.

As the coalescing spells above promised certain doom, reality tore open beside Guan Yu. A white rift appeared, through which emerged a whirling figure wielding an immense blade.

The air screamed as a crescent of battle qi – nearly two meters tall and a meter wide – arced upward, scattering the deadly magic gathering above Guan Yu's group.

Second Only to Wolf had arrived.

His blade danced like a roaring beast, each swing unleashing devastating battle qi waves that sent the Red Lotus disciples scrambling. These attacks dwarfed Guan Yu's in both size and power – where Guan Yu's slashes barely reached a meter, Second Only to Wolf's routinely exceeded two.

Sun Lianzi's triumphant grin froze. The East Sea Dragon Pearl had been within his grasp, yet this sudden reversal left him wounded and reeling.

**Chapter 5129: Divine Arts Perfected**

None anticipated this intervention. Second Only to Wolf's timely arrival disrupted the Red Lotus Sect's plans completely.

Guan Yu opened his eyes to the miraculous sight, coughing blood as he tried to speak. His body bore grievous wounds from withstanding Sun Lianzi's relentless assaults.

"Come with me!" Second Only to Wolf hauled Guan Yu into a nearby cavern, the group retreating to regroup. The Demon Sovereign, still locked in combat, breathed easier seeing Wang Xiaorong reach temporary safety.

The battlefield now seethed with tripartite conflict – Cloud Azure Sect, Soul Demon Sect, and Red Lotus Sect clashed in dazzling displays of magical fury.

Within the cavern, Second Only to Wolf checked Guan Yu's pulse. "Can you stand?"

"I'll manage," Guan Yu rasped, wiping blood from his lips. "How did you find us?"

"I traced you from Cloud Azure Sect. Explanations later – we need a plan."

The cavern's interior defied logic. As Guan Yu approached the water's edge, the liquid retreated like a living thing avoiding contact. Experiments revealed the East Sea Dragon Pearl's influence – wherever Guan Yu carried the artifact, water parted before him.

"These steps are man-made," Guan Yu observed, leading the group downward. After countless twists and turns, they emerged into an air-filled chamber beneath inverted seawater.

Before them loomed a massive stone gate, four meters tall, its surface etched with glowing golden patterns. Guan Yu's eyes lit with recognition. "The final segment of the Eight Aspect Drum technique!"

Summoning the Emperor's Seal, he released three golden streams of energy. The gate responded, its patterns detaching to form swirling characters in the air like luminous fireflies.

An ancient visage materialized on the gate. "Welcome, fated one. I am Ancestor Menghua. Behind this gate lies the East Sea Palace. Only with all four techniques may you enter and claim the legacy that shall elevate you to greatness."

As the gate rumbled open, splendor unfolded – a palace of pure gold and gemstones, its wealth surpassing kingdoms. Yet practical concerns arose: "How could we possibly move such treasure?" Jiang Yuankai wondered aloud.

**Chapter 5130: Breaking the Seal**

While others marveled at the golden fortress, Guan Yu's attention snapped to the Emperor's Seal. The complete Eight Aspect Drum technique raged within, threatening to shatter its containment.

"Master, you must assimilate this power now!" the artifact's spirit urged.

Absorbing the techniques triggered catastrophic conflict with Guan Yu's mental seals. Blood sprayed as internal damage mounted, consciousness fading into darkness...

Eons seemed to pass before awareness returned. Guan Yu's eyes snapped open, golden light blazing within. Memories cascaded – every forgotten moment restored as the seals shattered.

"I'm whole again," he declared, sensing the boundless energy of the World Sovereign Core within his dantian. Below it swirled an ocean of spiritual power – marks of near-immortal cultivation.

The group stared in awe as Guan Yu rose transformed. Second Only to Wolf recognized the change instantly: "World Sovereign Peak! You've regained your former power!"

Outside, combatants froze as seawater exploded skyward. From the parting waves emerged Guan Yu's group, their leader radiating terrifying might.

**Chapter 5131: The Might of a World Sovereign Peak**

The beach lay strewn with casualties. The defeated Demon Sovereign bled nearby, while Sun Lianzi's forces dwindled under Cloud Azure's assault.

Xuan Ming brandished the Hidden Dragon Sword, its azure energy coalescing into a pillar of destruction. "Surrender the Dragon Pearl, traitor!"

Guan Yu's laugh held winter's chill. "You overestimate yourself, 'Master'."

"Then die with your demon whore!" Xuan Ming's sword descended, the energy pillar crashing downward.

Guan Yu didn't flinch. A gesture conjured a blade of pure light – its radiance forcing onlookers to shield their eyes. With contemptuous ease, he sliced through Xuan Ming's attack, the energy dissipating harmlessly.

The battlefield stilled as realization dawned. This was no longer the disciple they'd known, but a reborn sovereign – his every breath thrumming with power that reshaped reality itself.
