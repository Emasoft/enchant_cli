“No, you must apologize and promise her! Otherwise, I won’t go back with you! I’ll leave with my son-in-law! We’ll return home only when you agree!” The middle-aged woman insisted stubbornly, her expression resolute.

Guan Yu awkwardly grinned at Sun Xiaoya, both rendered speechless by the situation.

“I’m sorry… My mother, she…” Sun Xiaoya sighed slightly and pointed to her temple.

“Hmm, I noticed,” Guan Yu replied.

“Then… I’m sorry! Please forgive me!” Biting her lip, Sun Xiaoya bowed slightly in apology.

“And don’t forget about having a child!” The woman interjected sternly, hands on hips.

Taking another deep breath, Sun Xiaoya’s delicate face flushed crimson as she mustered her courage: “When… when you come home, I… I’ll bear you a child!”

“There, that’s more like it! Young man, isn’t Xiaoya’s promise satisfactory? Let’s go home now!” The woman beamed, eagerly pulling Guan Yu’s arm.

“Mom, we need to return first. He still has matters to settle here. He’ll come home afterward!”

“Really? Is that true?” The woman eyed Guan Yu suspiciously.

“Yes. Mom, you should go back first.” Since this was merely an act for the elderly woman’s benefit, Guan Yu played along.

“Alright then! Your wife and I will return first! Remember to come home early!” The woman waved cheerfully as she and Sun Xiaoya hailed a taxi and departed.

Guan Yu exhaled deeply. He’d somehow acquired both a wife and a mother-in-law out of thin air! The absurdity struck him as he locked eyes with Dong Bin, and soon both erupted into uncontrollable laughter.

...

Early next morning, Guan Yu rose from his new apartment. After briskly washing up, he kicked Dong Bin’s bedroom door. “Get up! Take the bus back to Y City. I’m heading to school—won’t see you off.”

“Okay… You go first, Big Bro,” Dong Bin mumbled sleepily.

Carrying his bag, Guan Yu hailed a taxi outside the complex, heading straight for the prestigious academy.

Though he’d completed new student registration the previous afternoon by paying tuition to the principal, his class assignment remained pending.

Entering the academic affairs office, he found a portly middle-aged man smoking while reviewing files.

“Good morning, teacher. I’m here to report.”

“Hmm, Guan Yu? The principal mentioned you. Your records look decent. Study hard here.” Crushing his cigarette, the man stood with a belly-leading gesture. “Come, I’ll take you to your homeroom teacher.”

Following the administrator upstairs to the Grade 1 teachers’ office, they were greeted by staff filling water bottles. “Good morning, Director!”

“Is Teacher Sun here yet?”

“She went to her classroom. Shall I fetch her?” a female teacher offered.

“No need. Guan Yu, wait here. Teacher Sun—homeroom instructor for Class 6—will handle your enrollment.” The director departed after brief instructions.

Standing by the office door with his bag, Guan Yu surveyed his surroundings until a teacher gestured: “Have a seat. That’s Teacher Sun’s desk. Wait there.”

“Thank you.” Approaching the neat workstation, Guan Yu noted stacked textbooks and a pink cat-patterned mug. This Teacher Sun must be a prim, young instructor, he surmised.

“Teacher Sun, the director brought a transfer student waiting for you!”

Hearing this, Guan Yu turned—and froze. Sun Xiaoya stood at the doorway equally stunned, her petite mouth agape.

How? How had he become her student?! Recalling last night’s charade, Sun Xiaoya nearly fled. Heaven! This youth was now her pupil! Those promises about bearing children… She wanted to scream.

Breaking the tension first, Guan Yu cleared his throat: “Teacher Sun, hello. I’m Guan Yu, the new transfer student.”

“Ah… Yes. Follow me.” Regaining composure, Sun Xiaoya replied impassively.

Trailing behind her, Guan Yu grimaced internally. What a damn small world! The elegant beauty from last night’s farce was now his homeroom teacher? This bordered on surreal.

“Your name?” Sun Xiaoya asked coolly while walking.

“Guan Yu.”

“You drank alcohol last night, correct?”

“Yes,” he admitted quietly.

“Students must focus on academics. No drinking. Understood?” She glanced back sternly.

“Yes, Teacher Sun.”

Seeming satisfied with his compliance, she nodded slightly. “Thank you for last night. Please don’t mention my mother’s situation to classmates.” A faint blush surfaced.

Guan Yu nodded earnestly.

...

Entering Class 6, Sun Xiaoya silenced the chaotic morning study session with a frown. Instant quiet fell—her authority evident.

“Introducing our new transfer student: Guan Yu.”

Scanning the class, Guan Yu nodded politely. Students appraised him with indifferent curiosity.

“So handsome!”

“Totally my type!” Girls whispered excitedly.

“Guan Yu, sit beside Xu Ying. Consult her for academic matters.” Sun Xiaoya indicated a ponytailed girl with an oval face.

Meeting Xu Ying’s gaze briefly before she looked away, Guan Yu noted her cold demeanor. Thanking the teacher, he settled beside the aloof beauty.

Within moments, classroom chatter resumed. Snacks emerged, phones lit up, laughter bubbled.

“Whoa! The new guy got placed next to the Ice Princess!”

“Bet he won’t last a week!”

Overhearing remarks, Guan Yu glanced curiously at his neighbor. Xu Ying’s porcelain profile appeared serene—hardly the tyrant described.

As Guan Yu cleared his throat to retrieve textbooks, Xu Ying snapped: “Don’t speak. I’ve no time for chitchat or fake friendships. Disturb me, and I’ll demand seat reassignment.”

Blinking, Guan Yu retorted: “Did I speak? Seems you initiated this chat. Please be quiet—I need to study.”

Xu Ying gaped, cheeks flushing. The class collectively held its breath.

“He dissed our Ice Queen?!”

“First time someone rejected Xu Ying!”

Amidst buzzing whispers, Xu Ying glared. “Move! I need out!” she demanded between classes.

Rising silently, Guan Yu watched her flounce away. Before he could sit, a lanky boy loomed over him.

“Newbie, know your place. Obey Xu Ying, or I’ll beat you senseless.”

“Oh?” Guan Yu smirked. “Try.”

As the boy swung, Guan Yu caught his wrist in an iron grip. “Go on. ‘Beat me senseless.’”

“Let go!” The bully strained futilely.

“What’s happening?!” Xu Ying reappeared, glaring.

Releasing his grip, Guan Yu shrugged. “He wanted to ‘teach me manners.’”

“Yang Lin! Stop causing trouble!” Xu Ying snapped.

“This isn’t over!” Yang Lin retreated, rubbing his wrist. “You’ll pay!”

“Enough! I don’t need your help!” Xu Ying hissed at Guan Yu between classes.

“Help? You interrupted my self-defense.”

“You—!” Xu Ying’s face paled with fury. “Ungrateful jerk!”

“Delusional much?” Guan Yu chuckled, reopening his textbook.

...

By lunchtime, Guan Yu ate alone in the sparse cafeteria. Sun Xiaoya approached with her tray.

“Teacher Sun. Join me?”

“Guan Yu.” She sat stiffly, the weight of last night’s pretense lingering between them.
