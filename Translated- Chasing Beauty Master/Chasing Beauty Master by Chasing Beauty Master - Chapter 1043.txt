“Boss, let me handle this matter. I’ll take some men to investigate the situation there and report back to you.”

Guan Yu nodded and said, “That works. I think you should first go to Sun Xu’s territory. That area should be easier to resolve. Ge Yinglai’s side is likely already sealed off by the police, so we’ll wait a few days. We absolutely cannot give Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu any chance to recover.”

Wei Hongwei nodded. “Understood. I’ll take the men now and ensure everything is settled properly.” With that, he left.

Guan Yu’s plan was to strengthen the Yu Faction’s influence before the Yang Family auction. With the faction’s newfound funds, expanding their power was crucial for gradual growth. Now was the perfect opportunity—Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu would likely remain subdued for the foreseeable future.

Once Guan Yu seized their territories, the two would lose all value. Without utility, Bill Lin would soon expel them from the Feng Family.

Meanwhile, Wang Hu arrived at the hospital ward. Having heard of Jia Bo’s injuries, he’d come to visit, even formally bringing a basket of fruit.

Entering the room and seeing Guan Yu, Wang Hu stepped forward. “Boss, I heard many of our brothers were injured last night. Is everyone alright? What can I do to help?”

Guan Yu patted Wang Hu’s shoulder gently. “You’ve done well. I just sent Wei Hongwei to reclaim Sun Xu’s territory. But I’m worried he might be careless. Go assist him immediately and secure that area for me.”

Wang Hu nodded, exchanged a few words with Jia Bo, and left. Guan Yu then visited each ward to check on the injured brothers before preparing to meet Lin Qiaoqiao for updates.

Qian Yunqing’s internet café had been vandalized—a matter requiring attention. Guan Yu knew Sun Xu’s men were responsible, but with Sun Xu himself crippled, compensation would be difficult. It was best to clarify things directly.

“Guan Yu, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head back to arrange matters with the deceased’s families,” Jones said as they exited the hospital.

Guan Yu nodded. “You should rest first. If it’s too much, let Jiang Fenju handle it. But ensure the families are treated generously.”

After Jones left, Xue Jing asked, “Guan Yu, have we still not contacted the Yu Faction’s deceased members’ families?”

“I forgot about that. We can’t delay—we must comfort the families and settle this privately. Our brothers’ deaths aren’t like those from the Freedom Organization. This won’t be straightforward.”

“Why the difference? They’re all dead,” Xue Jing pressed curiously.

Guan Yu explained, “The Freedom Organization consists of seasoned cultivators. Their families understand the risks involved—high rewards come with high danger. The police typically don’t interfere.

But our Yu Faction members are mostly university students—precious in their parents’ eyes. Their deaths will cause outrage. If families reject compensation and involve the police, investigations could complicate everything. We need someone to soothe them first.”

Xue Jing asked, “Who’s suitable for this?”

Guan Yu smiled mysteriously. “Lin Qiaoqiao.” He then headed to her police station. As a captain, her authority would lend credibility, and her identity would persuade the families.

Lin Qiaoqiao awaited Guan Yu at the entrance. He joked upon arrival, “Captain Lin, greeting me personally? I’m honored.”

She smirked. “Don’t flatter yourself. I’m here for Xue Jing. Your ego’s unbelievable.”

Guan Yu glanced helplessly at Xue Jing, who laughed. “Then escort me inside, please. It’s sweltering out here.”

The station’s air conditioning offered relief. Lin Qiaoqiao led them to her office.

Before Guan Yu could sit, Lin Qiaoqiao blurted, “You’re here about last night, aren’t you? The two suspects I arrested named their instigator, but we haven’t found him yet. I’ve issued a warrant.”

“No need. He’s at the Feng Estate, missing a hand and foot,” Guan Yu revealed bluntly.

“What?!” Lin Qiaoqiao gasped. “How do you know? How was he injured?”

“Is the man you’re after named Sun Xu?”

“Yes! I spent all night interrogating people, and you knew already? Why didn’t you tell me?!” she complained.

Guan Yu ignored her irritation. “How many officers were dispatched today? Didn’t you hear about last night’s events? As captain, you should’ve known—it happened right at Qiaoyuan District’s entrance!”

Lin Qiaoqiao admitted, “A leather factory in the west was trashed, with many injured. Nearly the entire force is investigating. Only my team, busy with interrogations, stayed behind. Why? Do you know something?”

Guan Yu sighed. “That factory belongs to Sun Xu—a den of thugs. Just arrest a few troublemakers.”

“Impossible! It’s a major case. Initially thought a robbery, but nothing was stolen despite massive damage. We’re tracking the perpetrators,” she insisted.

Guan Yu grimaced—her officers might clash with his Yu Faction men. Xue Jing nudged him. “Explain before they arrest your people by mistake.”

Lin Qiaoqiao frowned. “What’s going on?”

“I ordered that factory razed. It’s Sun Xu’s territory. No one will file a report. Call your team back.”

“You—you’re a bandit! Why destroy property? Should I arrest you?” she shouted.

Guan Yu extended his wrists. “Go ahead.”

Xue Jing intervened. “Sun Xu sent men to vandalize the internet café. Later, he and Ge Yinglai gathered five hundred thugs to attack our home. Guan Yu repelled them, then retaliated. Sun Xu lost a hand and foot.”

Lin Qiaoqiao stared in disbelief. “Five hundred people? You drove them off? Is Guan Yu a god?”

Xue Jing rolled her eyes. “Check Qiaoyuan Street—it was drenched in blood. Guan Yu hired spray trucks to clean it this morning.”

Though skeptical, Lin Qiaoqiao prioritized recalling her team. After making calls, she mused how Guan Yu’s ruthlessness contrasted her past image of him.

“You crippled Sun Xu. Who’ll compensate Qian Yunqing?” she demanded.

Guan Yu asked, “Have you assessed the damages?”

“Here’s the estimate—over six hundred thousand.” She handed him a document.

Guan Yu glanced at the total. “A few computers and chairs cost this much?”

Lin Qiaoqiao blushed. “I…added fees for emotional distress and lost business. Since Sun Xu’s gone, I didn’t expect you’d pay…”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Seventy thousand it is. I’ll have it delivered.”

“You’re paying? Let me adjust—”

“No need. It’s not my money,” he dismissed.

Xue Jing added, “We need another favor. Three Yu Faction brothers died last night. We need you to comfort their families—offer generous compensation to prevent lawsuits.”

Lin Qiaoqiao stiffened. “Three deaths? You want me to cover this up?”

“Use your authority. Tell them it was an accident. Cap compensation at two million per family,” Guan Yu said.

“Two million? That’s excessive! Fifty thousand suffices!”

“It’s not my money. They died for me—it’s the least I can do.”

Lin Qiaoqiao frowned. “Whose money?”

Xue Jing explained, “The Feng Family funded this after their failed ambush. Guan Yu extorted them.”

Lin Qiaoqiao gaped. “You blackmailed the Fengs? And now you’re targeting the Fangs?”

“Fang Su’s next,” Guan Yu confirmed. “I’ll take his limbs too, as you suggested.”

Lin Qiaoqiao clenched her fists. “Good! That scum deserves it for harassing my family.”

After settling details, Guan Yu left. Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei and Wang Hu led Yu Faction members to the western leather factory, ready to claim their new territory.
