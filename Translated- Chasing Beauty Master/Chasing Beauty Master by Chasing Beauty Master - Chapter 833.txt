Guanyu called Aunt Qing out to give her the money, fearing Uncle Qing might refuse if he knew. Yet Aunt Qing also declined. At his wit's end, Guanyu pleaded, "Auntie, if I ever face difficulties in the future, I know you'll help me. Consider this money a loan. When you're able, repay me. Would that work?"

Aunt Qing lowered her head silently, still resistant. Just then, Uncle Qing emerged from inside, having overheard. "We'll accept this for now," he declared. "To repay Guanyu's kindness, we must first survive. Let it be as he says—a loan this old man will surely return."

Relieved they finally relented, Guanyu smiled wryly. "There we go. You really put me through the wringer." He pressed the plastic bag of cash into Aunt Qing's hands.

Not lingering after settling matters, Guanyu spent over a day returning to City A. He avoided Qiaoyuan District upon arrival—Wei Hongwei had called en route, reporting Cao Jin was causing trouble again at Kaihuang Academy's gates.

By noon, Cao Jin had inexplicably blockaded the school entrance with his gang, trapping students during lunch hour. The incompetent security guards proved useless. Police arrived but retreated to a street corner upon seeing the mob, awaiting developments.

Guanyu arrived in Pan Taisheng's truck, surveying the hundred-strong crowd choking the entrance. Staying inside the vehicle, he called Wei Hongwei. "What sparked this?"

"Messed-up cafeteria business," Wei Hongwei mumbled. "Cao Jin's pissed some freshman girl from Sister Ji's crew rejected him. Now he's demanding they hand her over."

"What's Sister Ji doing? She protects those girls. Why isn't she handling this?"

Guanyu remained in the truck, dialing again. "Any updates?"

"Sister Ji tried negotiating," Wei Hongwei explained, "but Cao Jin won't budge. Threatens to keep the blockade until 'Number Four' comes out."

Exasperated, Guanyu sighed. Though this stemmed from Sister Ji's cafeteria operations, as Kaihuang's de facto leader, he couldn't ignore it without losing students' trust.

Calling Sister Ji, he demanded, "This has blown up. What's really happening?"

Her coy laughter trickled through the line. "Oh, Brother Guanyu, come to mock me? Cao Jin's just a perverted hick my girls won't touch. Now he's squatting at our gates like a stray dog. Since you're here, you handle it."

"Your charm couldn't move him," Guanyu countered, "and this isn't my mess. I won't meddle in cafeteria affairs."

"Siblings should help each other," she purred. "Wouldn't want rumors spreading that Kaihuang's leader cowered before Cao Jin? Imagine the talk—'Guanyu hid while Cao Jin hunted schoolgirls!'"

Guanyu grimaced. Though the cafeteria's illicit activities were semi-public, full exposure would humiliate him. "Clever trap," he conceded. "But if the girl refuses, what can I do?"

"Your reputation shields my operations," Sister Ji flattered. "Handle it without harming my girls. They're terrified—I must comfort them." Click.

Resigned, Guanyu approached the mob. Students erupted when spotting him—"Guanyu's here!"—their hopeful cheers rippling through the crowd.

Cao Jin spun around as Guanyu strode through the miraculously parting throng. "Can't I chase skirts without your interference?" he snarled.

"Your mouth reeks worse than ever," Guanyu smirked, stopping inches from Cao Jin. "You're blocking hundreds from lunch. Aren't you hungry?"

Behind Guanyu, Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo marshaled students armed with makeshift weapons—mop handles, chair legs, bricks. The opened gates revealed their formidable numbers.

"Boss says they act tough, we crush 'em!" Wei Hongwei shouted. Chants of "Beat them!" swelled.

Guanyu raised a calming hand. "Let's avoid bloodshed. Leave now."

Cao Jin wavered. Retreat meant humiliation, but fighting meant defeat. "I'm just retrieving my girl," he blustered. "Call this provocation?"

Laughter erupted. "He's lovesick!" students jeered.

"Kaihuang protects its students on campus," Guanyu declared. "Chase your crush elsewhere."

Grudgingly, Cao Jin dismissed most followers, keeping five lackeys. As the crowd dispersed, Guanyu prepared to take Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo to lunch when a familiar engine roar approached.

Feng Xihu's sleek sports car careened around the corner. "Stop her!" Guanyu shouted, bolting for Pan's truck. Wei and Jia lunged into the road, but Feng accelerated wildly, forcing them to dive aside.

CRASH! Feng T-boned Pan's truck. Airbags deployed as metal crumpled.

"You trying to kill me?!" Guanyu staggered out unharmed.

Feng emerged unscathed, fury blazing. "You break into my room at night, then play innocent?"

"Guanyu! Where will you run now?" Feng stormed forward as Wei restrained Jia from confronting her.

"Miss Feng," Guanyu spread his hands, "what grudge drives this? A death wish?"

"You invaded my bedroom!" she seethed, meeting his gaze despite their height difference. "Dare deny it?"
