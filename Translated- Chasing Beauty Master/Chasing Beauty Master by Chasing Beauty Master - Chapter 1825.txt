“Chapter 4776: A Bright Future”

Chu Fan pondered that if Wan Hong truly belonged to Princess Chang’s faction, today’s affairs would grow thornier. Circumstances compelled him to this conclusion.

No stranger would casually gift Lady Jiang such a priceless treasure without ulterior motives unless they were fools. Only someone sent by Princess Chang could explain this audacity. The Consort’s household overflowed with rare artifacts; sending an unfamiliar agent to present their own heirloom to their daughter merely circulated family possessions.

This logic held. By publicly bestowing the East Sea Dragon Pearl upon Lady Jiang, they deliberately shamed Chu Fan’s modest means through overt humiliation. Now, Wan Hong’s price inflations for the Red Beauty Theater’s estate sought to deepen this disgrace. Chu Fan knew only Princess Chang would orchestrate such schemes.

Yet awareness brought no remedy. Facing imperial might, Chu Fan could only swallow his pride. For Lady Jiang’s sake, he must endure and grow until the princess acknowledged his worth through achievements, not confrontations.

——

Unaware of these machinations, Guan Yu remained determined to claim the estate. Though privy to Chu Fan’s entanglements with Lady Jiang, he saw no reason for deference in this unrelated matter.

“Forty-five thousand taels!” Chu Fan gritted through clenched teeth.

As Red Beauty Theater’s troupe leader, he’d exhausted himself with performances to fund this purchase—a foundation for establishing roots in the capital. His twenty-strong troupe relied on him for wages and sustenance. For months, he’d delayed payments to save for this estate, relying on their patient understanding despite many members’ familial obligations.

Today’s auction should have crowned his efforts. Instead, the reserve price’s unexpected hike and Wan Hong’s interference plunged his hopes into despair. Even if he staked everything, Princess Chang’s bottomless coffers would prevail. Once lost, this opportunity would never return. Worse, prolonged resistance might see the princess evicting his troupe or crushing his livelihood entirely.

——

Days prior, Chu Fan had met Consort Jiang—Lady Jiang’s father. Though unimpressed by the entertainer’s status, the consort hadn’t opposed their bond outright. “A noble daughter cannot wed a performer,” he’d stated plainly, yet offered time for Chu Fan to prove himself, even discreet aid. Observing Chu Fan’s conduct and his daughter’s devotion, Consort Jiang valued character over station—a stark contrast to Princess Chang’s rigid protocols.

A former Jianghu wanderer, Consort Jiang prioritized happiness over societal expectations. Still, he warned Chu Fan: current standing barred any union. Only through self-made prestige could doors open.

Chu Fan accepted this truth. His renown as a celebrated performer remained inadequate. To shed this identity, he needed wealth and ventures beyond the stage. Acquiring the estate would elevate him from troupe leader to proprietor—a visible step toward legitimacy. Located in the capital’s heart, this property would showcase his financial prowess.

Next, he planned to venture into commerce, eyeing a luxury horse ranch. Months ago, a northern tribesman’s account of lucrative horse trades had inspired this vision. Partnering with suppliers of premium steeds, he’d cater to the capital’s aristocracy, eventually monopolizing its equestrian market. Success here would grant the status to court Lady Jiang properly.

Yet all required silver—mountains of it. Even this overpriced estate formed a crucial cornerstone.

——

Princess Chang’s meddling threatened to erode his resolve. Chu Fan feared failing Lady Jiang more than any personal ruin.

“Forty-five thousand from Master Chu!” the auctioneer announced. “Minimum increments of five thousand. Any advances?”

“Fifty thousand!” Guan Yu bellowed, palms spread.

The crowd erupted. “Madman!” someone scoffed near Guan Yu. “For this price, he could buy a larger estate a street away!”

“First the Dragon Pearl, now this?” another jeered. “Either he’s courting Lady Jiang or crushing Chu Fan.”

“Everyone knows Chu Fan and Lady Jiang’s bond,” a voice countered. “After her public declaration, only fools would challenge him!”

“Fools or those shielded by power,” another muttered. “Princess Chang’s opposition draws rivals like flies.”

Guan Yu basked in the buzz, careless of misinterpretations. Let them think him a lovestruck fool—his true motives required no defense. Yet Chu Fan’s venomous glare unsettled him. Perhaps later, he’d explain this wasn’t rivalry but strategy.

——

“He’s clearly Princess Chang’s pawn,” Chu Fan told Lady Jiang, watching her brow furrow. “No others dare cross me so brazenly.”

“Chapter 4777: Petty Schemes”

Lady Jiang stood, eyeing Guan Yu. “Why target the theater? What does Wan Hong want?”

“To undermine me,” Chu Fan replied bitterly. “Your mother’s latest move.”
