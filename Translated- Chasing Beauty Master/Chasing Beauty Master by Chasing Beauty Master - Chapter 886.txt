“After getting out of the car, Jinhua found herself facing a charming two-story duplex. The house looked exquisite, and the sprawling garden was filled with lush greenery. Westerners truly prioritized air quality—unlike in China, where the air in city centers was abysmal, choked by endless skyscrapers that left little room for even a single tree.

‘Please come in,’ the girl greeted cheerfully upfront. Jinhua happily linked arms with Guan Yu while A Cai trailed behind, the three stepping into the girl’s cozy villa.

Though the interior wasn’t particularly spacious, it radiated warmth. Guan Yu had assumed her family would be home, but the house was empty.

Seated on the sofa with fruit, Jinhua noticed the absence and asked, ‘By the way, we haven’t even asked your name yet.’

The girl smiled. ‘Just call me Laili.’

‘Oh, Laili—are your family members out working?’ Jinhua pressed.

Laili poured everyone a small glass of red wine. ‘My sister’s at work, so I’m alone here.’

‘Your sister? Don’t your parents live here?’ Guan Yu probed, noting her East Asian features. Perhaps she and her sister had come to work abroad without their parents.

‘No, my parents are still in Japan. My sister and I came here for university and stayed after graduating to work,’ Laili explained.

‘That must’ve been tough—two young sisters relying on each other so far from home,’ Jinhua remarked.

‘My aunt married into this country years ago. She encouraged us to study here and still checks on us regularly. She’s been wonderful.’

Guan Yu nodded, relieved to hear they had family support. No responsible parent would let daughters venture abroad otherwise.

**Chapter 2271: Hosting a Meal (Part 2)**

‘Well then, make yourselves comfortable! I’ll prepare lunch shortly. You’ll get to taste my cooking!’ Laili said brightly.

Jinhua initially offered to help but soon trudged back from the kitchen. ‘What’s wrong? Weren’t you assisting?’ Guan Yu asked.

‘Ugh, Laili’s making local dishes—hamburgers, fried eggs, stuff from her hometown. I couldn’t figure any of it out. Foreigners eat so many raw things!’ Jinhua grumbled.

Guan Yu sighed, already dreading the meal. He preferred Chinese cuisine—thoroughly cooked, unlike the bloody steaks or raw fish foreigners favored.

As A Cai distractedly watched TV, Guan Yu seized the moment to discuss plans against the human traffickers. ‘A Cai,’ he called. The boy jolted, lost in thought.

‘Y-yes? What is it, boss?’

‘What’s on your mind?’

A Cai shook his head bleakly. ‘Just…uncertainty. I don’t know what’ll happen next. If they catch me again, I’m dead.’

His doubt in Guan Yu’s protection was palpable. Guan Yu smiled gently. ‘Tell me your story. How did you end up here?’

Jinhua joined them, snacks in hand, as A Cai began: ‘Four years ago, I lived in a suburb near A City—Lingkou District.’

Both Guan Yu and Jinhua stiffened. ‘Lingkou? You’re from there?’ Jinhua exclaimed.

A Cai tensed. ‘Y-yes…do you have enemies there?’

‘The Feng family!’ Jinhua spat. ‘Those vile—’

Guan Yu cut her off. ‘My feud with them is separate. Go on, A Cai.’

‘The Fengs…’ A Cai’s fists clenched, nails digging into palms. ‘I swore I’d kill Feng Shaoye someday.’

‘What did he do to you?’ Jinhua leaned in.

‘Murdered my father. Stole my fiancée.’ A Cai’s voice trembled. ‘I was a scholarship student at Kaihuang Academy. My classmate—Sun Taotao—was the monitor and my desk partner. We…fell for each other. But Feng Shaoye harassed her relentlessly. No one dared oppose him—not even teachers.’

He continued, hollow-eyed: ‘One day, Feng’s thugs broke into my home, beat me unconscious, and kidnapped my sister. When she returned days later…’ He choked up. ‘She was broken. Mentally, physically. We reported it, but the police took Feng’s bribes. He bragged, “I’d rather tip the station than pay trash like you.”

‘My parents fell ill from grief. I moved them and my sister to the countryside, working nonstop to afford treatments. Then a girl offered me a “lucrative job”—a trap. I was sold south, forced into labor camps. For years, I survived by clinging to one thought: *I must live to kill Feng Shaoye.*

‘Through exhaustion, I somehow awakened qi—became a cultivator. It gave me strength to endure. Eventually, I was sold here. The gang noticed my energy and “trained” me to steal. Refusal meant beatings…or drugs that felt like fire ants under my skin. Today was my first mission. Then you caught me.’

Jinhua seethed. ‘That Feng bastard ruins everything he touches!’

Guan Yu steered the conversation back. ‘Describe the trafficking den. How many are there?’

‘Nearly 100 victims. Over 200 handlers, trainers, guards. And this is just one of their hubs.’

**Chapter 2273: The Instructor**

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. Even a ‘small’ operation posed a massive threat if combined with others.

A Cai added, ‘The instructors are ruthless. When I tried escaping after unlocking my qi, their leader crushed me in one move—like you did earlier, boss. They broke me with drugs until I obeyed.’

Jinhua shuddered. ‘What now?’

‘We gather intel,’ Guan Yu said. ‘Strike when they’re vulnerable.’ His eyes hardened—not just for A Cai, but countless others suffering under Feng’s shadow. The reckoning would come.
