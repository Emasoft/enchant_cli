“Hurry, go upstairs and get the manager!” one of Jia Bo’s subordinates urged frantically. The man immediately dashed toward the second floor, knowing Jia Bo was in one of the private rooms. Though aware of what his boss might be doing inside, the urgency of the situation left no room for hesitation—he had to find Jia Bo immediately.

The few remaining male staff members all belonged to the Yu Gang. Given the gang’s notorious reputation, no one dared cause trouble here under normal circumstances. This was precisely why Jia Bo had replaced the male security guards with female servers.

Yet, against all expectations, disaster struck on the very night of the staffing change. Jia Bo, in the midst of a passionate moment—fumbling with his companion’s belt—was startled when the door to the private room burst open with a crash.

“Who the fuck has the guts to interrupt me?!” Jia Bo roared, livid. His trusted subordinates, usually sharp and reliable, had committed an unforgivable blunder by ruining such a perfect moment.

The young man at the door panted, “Manager, it’s chaos downstairs! Over twenty people stormed in and started smashing everything. Several customers are injured, and they’re wrecking the place. We’re outnumbered—we can’t hold them off!”

“What?!” Jia Bo’s rage exploded. How dare anyone cause trouble in the Yu Gang’s territory? Were they tired of living?

“Fuck! My fists have been itching for a fight. Perfect timing—I’ll crack their skulls open myself!” Jia Bo snarled, storming out. His night of pleasure was ruined, and worse, this sabotage had occurred on his second day as manager. It reeked of a deliberate provocation.

The sounds of destruction below only fueled his fury. “Call for backup!” he barked at the subordinate. “I’ll grab a weapon and deal with these bastards!”

The young man hastily dialed for reinforcements while Jia Bo snatched a fire extinguisher and charged downstairs.

The scene that greeted him was catastrophic. The newly renovated bar, the Yu Gang’s pride, lay in ruins. “You motherfuckers!” Jia Bo bellowed. Yanking the extinguisher’s safety pin, he unleashed a cloud of white foam at the attackers. His remaining men followed suit, arming themselves with extinguishers from nearby exits.

The choking haze of chemical foam disoriented the intruders, forcing coughs and retreats. Though the initial barrage slowed their assault, the twenty-strong mob quickly regrouped. Jia Bo hurled his emptied extinguisher at one assailant, knocking him unconscious. “Fight back! Don’t let a single one escape! Show them the Yu Gang’s might!”

Outnumbered four to twenty, Jia Bo and his men stood their ground. The attackers, undeterred, continued demolishing the bar. Female staff screamed hysterically, their cries grating on Jia Bo’s nerves. In the past, he’d have fled such odds. But tempered by the Yu Gang’s ethos and Guan Yu’s influence, he now embodied unyielding defiance.

Brandishing extinguishers as both shields and clubs, Jia Bo’s trio faced the mob. “Who the hell sent you?!” he demanded.

“None of your business,” a voice retorted. “We’re just following orders. Stand down, and no one gets hurt.”

“Stand down while you trash my bar? Go to hell!” Jia Bo spat, surveying the wreckage. His managerial career—scarce two days old—was crumbling. “Attack!”

Seizing another extinguisher, he advanced, spraying foam until the canister sputtered empty. A mocking voice jeered, “Out already? Need a refill?”

Jia Bo discarded the empty tank. “You’ll pay for this!”

The intruders, coated in white, lunged with baseball bats. Jia Bo’s men braced for a beating, resolved to uphold the gang’s honor even in defeat.

As a bat swung toward Jia Bo’s skull, a sudden click froze the room. A compact revolver pressed against the attacker’s forehead. “Move that bat one millimeter,” Jia Bo hissed, “and I paint the wall with your brains.”

His men exhaled in relief. The gun—a gift from Guan Yu for high-ranking members—had turned the tide. Jia Bo, once enamored with heavy artillery, now appreciated the discreet firepower.

“P-please don’t shoot!” the bat-wielder stammered, trembling.

Jia Bo confiscated the bat. “Like these, huh?” He swung hard, dropping the man. “Who’s next?”

The mob faltered, fear replacing bravado. Guns changed everything.

“Call your boss. Now,” Jia Bo ordered, aiming the revolver.

“We’re from the Dark Sun Organization,” their leader claimed. “Poisonous Widow sends her regards.”

Jia Bo scoffed. “That venomous hag? Tell her the Yu Gang will crush her remnants.” Suspecting Bill Lin’s involvement, he prioritized detaining the thugs for interrogation.

As reinforcements arrived, Jia Bo’s focus shifted to salvaging his reputation. “Beat them senseless!” he commanded. “They’ll regret crossing the Yu Gang!”

Amid the chaos, he noted the cowering staff. “Help the injured, you fools!” he barked. Reluctantly, the servers complied, tending to bloodied patrons.

Jia Bo’s revolver never wavered. “Who’s in charge here? Step forward!”

Silence. He singled out the spokesperson. “Beat him. Hard.”

Yu Gang members seized bats, thrashing the man mercilessly. “None walk out unharmed!” Jia Bo vowed. Tonight’s humiliation demanded blood—his future depended on it.

The bar, already battered, echoed with cracks of wood on flesh. Jia Bo’s mind raced: Guan Yu’s wrath, his crumbling authority, the costly repairs. Yet amidst the violence, a grim satisfaction bloomed. The Yu Gang’s reputation—and his own—would survive this trial by fire.
