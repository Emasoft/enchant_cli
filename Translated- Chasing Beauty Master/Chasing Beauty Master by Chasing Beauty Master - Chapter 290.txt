“On the other hand, Wang Zhen seemed mostly unharmed aside from a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.

This fueled Qian Younian’s intense resentment. Why should he be disfigured and unable to “fire cannons” these days while Wang Zhen remained unscathed?

After his threats, Qian Younian added, “Aim for his face—beat his face to a pulp!”

The crowd hesitated, retaining a shred of reason. These were members of the school basketball team and association who usually followed Qian Younian’s lead, but that didn’t mean blind obedience. They’d assumed Qian merely wanted to teach Wang Zhen a lesson, but now Qian’s refusal to stop made them fear lethal consequences.

“Keep beating him! I’ll take responsibility!” Qian declared. “Succeed, and I’ll owe you all a favor.” He knew threats alone wouldn’t sway them, but he no longer cared—he wanted Wang Zhen scarred for life.

As the saying goes, “Rewards breed daring men.” Qian’s favor might not seem grand, but for those clawing upward, his powerful father’s influence was irresistible.

With reservations gone, the mob charged at Wang Zhen, wooden clubs raised.

Qian sneered, determined to ensure Wang never left that dorm room. Suddenly, a gust of wind swept through the room. Before he could question it, a figure materialized, wielding a club with brutal efficiency. Each swing felled a man, striking heads with ruthless precision. Victims collapsed, twitching silently.

Qian’s blood ran cold. This newcomer’s brutality dwarfed Wang Zhen’s. Fleeing seemed wise, but as he bolted, a club struck his skull. He crumpled, joining the groaning pile.

The dorm fell silent.

“Brother Yu!” Wang Zhen rasped, wincing. Guan Yu’s combat prowess thrilled him despite his injuries.

Guan Yu, cold-eyed and composed, turned to Wang. “You okay?”

“Just... agh!” Wang clutched his chest.

“Pain’s nothing. Fighting solo against these scum isn’t shameful,” Guan Yu said.

Wang grinned weakly.

“What happened?” Guan Yu asked.

Wang explained Qian’s bed-seizing attempt and the brawl. “This bastard’s hated me since his crush became my girl,” he added, smirking.

Guan Yu approached the battered Qian. “Stealing beds is one thing—harming my brother demands retribution!” He unleashed a flurry of kicks and punches, leaving Qian unrecognizable.

Witnesses trembled, grateful Guan spared them similar brutality. With a contemptuous toss, Guan dismissed Qian’s limp form. “This is the price for harming my brother. Remember it.”

The chastened crowd scattered.

Later, alone in the trashed dorm, Wang voiced concern: “Won’t the school come after us? His dad’s influential.”

Guan shrugged. “We’re in the right. My brothers aren’t punching bags—someone must pay.”

Warmed by Guan’s loyalty, Wang changed topics: “Why’s Qian handling dorm assignments? That’s the male council’s job.”

“Power plays. Not everyone’s humble like you, Brother Yu. Without their dads’ clout, they’d be nobodies.”

**Chapter 734: Upholding Justice**

Guan settled into the dorm. Under his urging, Niu Le returned to campus life—too young for full-time work. Though academia wasn’t his path, Guan cherished student life. Yet peace eluded him.

Guan’s brutal beating of Qian made him infamous. While some condemned his violence, others admired his ruthless efficiency, swelling his following.

The backlash forced school leaders to act under parental pressure. Guan received probation—a step from expulsion. For his teacher’s report, he met with Liu Shilei.

In the office, Liu feigned sternness: “Your actions endangered school reputation. Fighting’s not student conduct!”

“I protected my roommate from a mob. Self-defense,” Guan countered.

“But you went too far. Write a reflection!” Liu relented.

Another teacher, Xia Chengfeng, interjected: “A reflection? He deserves expulsion!”

Liu bristled. “I decide my student’s punishment. He defended his friend—a noble intent.”

Xia backtracked: “My mistake. Youthful indiscretion deserves guidance.”

Liu dismissed Xia’s dinner invitation: “I cook for my brother.”

Xia left, discomfited. Outside, Guan waited, keys in hand.

“Wait—you’re her brother?” Xia asked, aiming to curry favor.

“I waited for you,” Guan said.

**Chapter 735: Nostalgic Past?**

At noon, Liu cooked for Guan in her dorm. Xia’s failed advances left him stewing. His attempts to bond with Guan—now key to reaching Liu—proved futile. The subtle power dynamic shifted as Guan’s presence redefined relationships.
