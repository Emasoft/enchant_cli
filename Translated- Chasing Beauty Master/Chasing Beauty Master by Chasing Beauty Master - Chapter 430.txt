This time, however, he found himself utterly powerless. Who was Guan Yu? This was a man who wouldn’t even spare face for the Song family. Even if he pleaded on behalf of Wang Sibin, would Guan Yu grant any leniency?

Noticing his inner turmoil, Guan Yu remarked indifferently, “It’s nothing serious. He merely owes me a gambling debt. Let him fulfill it.”

Relieved to hear it was just a bet, Tang Siming exhaled sharply and snapped, “Why are you still standing here? Hurry up and settle your debt with Young Master Guan!”

Wang Sibin hesitated painfully. Honoring the bet meant public humiliation through streaking, but defiance was unthinkable. Even a fool could see Guan Yu was no ordinary man to provoke. The consequences of refusal were crystal clear.

As Wang dithered, Tang Siming’s patience frayed. “Damn it! I’ve swallowed my pride to plead for you, yet you dawdle here? Do you think Guan Yu is some merciful saint who’ll let this slide?”

Under Tang’s glare, Wang gritted his teeth and began stripping, only to be kicked out by Guan Yu. “Strip outside! I won’t have your filth tainting my wife’s eyes.”

**Chapter 1075: Loyalty Exists Only When the Price of Betrayal Is Insufficient**

After Wang left, Qin Tian and Zheng Chaoyang wavered until Guan Yu coldly demanded, “Need me to strip you myself?”

“Guan Yu, don’t overstep! My father is—” Qin’s threat died as a kick sent him crumpling to the floor, groaning.

Tang Siming shook his head. Even if Qin’s father dominated the southern regions, in the capital, he’d have to crawl.

Witnessing this, Qin Tian fled without another word.

“Young Master Guan, why were they… undressing?” Tang asked, baffled.

“Streaking.”

Tang blinked, then burst into laughter. No wonder they’d hesitated! Wang Sibin’s public nudity would become legendary mockery. Still, Tang reasoned, humiliation beat losing one’s life or career.

As dishes arrived, Guan Yu invited Tang to dine. While the women ate ravenously, Tang broached the Song family dilemma.

Guan Yu shrugged, tearing into lobster. “We’ll counter their moves as they come. Soldiers at the gates? Build a dam.”

His nonchalance masked calculated patience. The Songs were probing his defenses, and Guan Yu refused to flinch.

But Tang fretted. “The Songs advance fiercely! We must act!”

Two days prior, Elder Liu had pressured Tang to pick sides. Loyalty bound Tang to Guan Yu, yet he feared total ruin.

Suddenly, Tang Xiao interjected, “I grasp Young Master Guan’s strategy.”

“You understand nothing—” Tang Siming began, but Guan Yu cut him off. “Enlighten us.”

“The principle is clear,” Tang Xiao said smoothly. “Enemies idle, we wait. Enemies strike, we obliterate.”

Guan Yu stiffened—this youth had pierced his unspoken plans.

“Don’t be surprised,” Tang Xiao explained. “As an outsider, I see clearly. Plus, I studied Three Kingdoms tactics—psychological warfare transcends eras.”

Guan Yu shook his head. “Three Kingdoms is too noble. Against ruthless foes, study *The Art of Dark and Thick*.”

Tang Xiao’s eyes lit up. “Understood.”

Baffled, Tang Siming demanded, “What’s this about?”

“Father,” Tang Xiao grinned, “Young Master Guan just accepted me as his subordinate.”

After securing Tang Xiao’s allegiance, Guan Yu later confronted him privately. “What do you want from me?”

“Experience. Connections.” Ambition blazed in Tang Xiao—he’d elevate his family to rival the Songs and Eastern Clans. Guan Yu was his springboard.

“Loyalty means nothing,” Guan Yu stated. “Betrayal hinges on price. Your task: expel Taiwan’s Song clan from the capital in five days.”

**Chapter 1076: The Pursuit**

“You ask the impossible,” Tang Xiao sighed. The Taiwan Songs wouldn’t retreat lightly.

“I keep no deadweight.”

Cornered, Tang Xiao vowed, “Five days. They’ll leave.”

At meal’s end, a trembling Wang Sibin returned. Guan Yu eyed him. “You run an entertainment company?”

Wang nodded frantically. This youth had stirred the capital’s waters, defying the Songs and Lees. Survival meant obedience—and opportunity.

“Make them stars within a year.” Guan Yu pointed to Wen Ya and Chen Si.

Wen Ya’s ex, Guan Yu couldn’t abandon her dream.

“Some never forget old flames,” cooed Wen Qing, while Mo Ling teased Guan Yu’s “philandering.”

Flushing, Wen Ya swallowed her pride, accepting help. Chen Si winked—this was their golden ticket.

Post-meal, Wen Ya cornered Guan Yu. “Thank you.”

“Don’t.” He turned coldly away.

Watching him leave, Wen Ya’s heart cracked.

“Chase him,” Chen Si urged. “If he cares, he’ll help. This is your chance!”

Doubt melted into resolve. Wen Ya clenched her fists—she’d win him back.

**Chapter 1077: The Core of Matters**

At the retirement compound, Elder Wen summoned Guan Yu to strategize against the Songs.

Under the weight of retired titans’ gazes, Guan Yu stood unfazed—a quality noted approvingly.

“Meet Elder Zhou, Ye, Wu, Shen…” Elder Wen introduced the powerbrokers.

“Promising lad,” Elder Zhou appraised.

Elder Liu cut in, “We’re not here for compliments! Guan, the Songs—”

The real game began.
