“Worthy nephew, such words sound too formal!” Old Master Li insisted, retaining his grip. “How could you call this place ‘outside’? Consider it your own home. If your attendant is unwell, why not let him recuperate properly here? You may depart once he’s recovered—there’s no need to rush.”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected the man to be so persistent. Rising to his feet, he said, “I appreciate your hospitality, Old Master Li, but we truly are pressed for time.”

The old master’s smile stiffened, a flicker of suspicion crossing his features. “Very well,” he chuckled dryly. “Since you insist on leaving, I shan’t detain you further. Though I must ask—rumors speak of upheaval in Qujiang City. Has your family encountered trouble? Could your journey be related to this?”

Guan Yu inwardly noted the man’s sharp ears. *He’s undoubtedly referring to the Ancestral Menghua’s underground palace incident.* Aloud, he nodded gravely. “Indeed. Our household guards grew complacent, allowing the Demonic Soul Sect to infiltrate. They slaughtered nearly all our defenders overnight, seeking some secret passage in our rear courtyard—a place I never knew existed! Their intelligence was alarmingly precise. This... incident has shaken our family’s security profoundly.”

Old Master Li stroked his beard, realizing his question had been redundant—even children now gossiped about the event. “Ah! You must tighten household defenses henceforth. Guards should be both competent and loyal—no hiring outsiders carelessly.”

“Father dismissed every retainer afterward,” Guan Yu continued smoothly. “Maidservants, surviving guards—all expelled. He’s conducting exhaustive screenings for replacements. The attack left me severely wounded and my mother traumatized. His anger is justified.”

“Quite proper! Disorder cannot be tolerated.” The old master leaned forward. “But how does the magistrate tolerate such lawlessness? Though officials avoid Jianghu disputes, slaughter within citizens’ homes surely demands intervention!”

Guan Yu snorted. “The magistrate’s office lacks strength. Their forces, though slightly better than yours here, pale against mercenaries my father can hire.”

Having exhausted inquiries without uncovering flaws in Guan Yu’s story, Old Master Li reluctantly conceded. Seizing the initiative, Guan Yu added, “The Demonic Soul Sect operated covertly in Qujiang for years before discovering that entrance. Even the renowned Echo Pavilion belonged to their cult—shocking, isn’t it?”

As Wang Jun returned, Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. “You took your time.”

“Apologies.” Wang Jun bowed. “This labyrinthine estate confused me—had to circle twice before finding my way back. My young master’s mansion,” he added pointedly, “is both grander and more sensibly laid out.”

Old Master Li chuckled without rancor. “Naturally! My humble abode cannot compare to the Luo family’s splendor.”

Guan Yu stood decisively. “We’ve trespassed too long on your kindness. Might we purchase one of your carriages?”

“Purchase?” The old master waved dismissively. “Take any from the stables as my gift.” Summoning his steward, he instructed, “Let them choose freely.”

As they followed the steward, Wang Jun whispered, “How’d you charm that carriage from him?”

“Skill beyond your grasp,” Guan Yu teased. “Observe and learn.”

The stables proved disappointing—a dozen mediocre draft horses, none matching Elder Lu’s fine steeds. Wang Jun smirked at the pretentious display, while Guan Yu selected a dust-covered foreign-made carriage with ornate fittings.

The steward paled—this was Second Young Master’s prized possession. Yet bound by his lord’s orders, he complied. Soon the exotic vehicle stood hitched, Guan Yu casually adding, “And those beast tendons Old Master Li promised?”

Led to a storeroom, they found a chest of processed sinews. Guan Yu selected sturdy ox tendons before departing. Once beyond the estate, Wang Jun marveled, “Your Qujiang Luo family tale worked wonders! How’d you fabricate such convincing details?”

“Fabricate?” Guan Yu grinned. “The Luo family—Xiao Zhi’s maternal relatives—truly sheltered me. Their fake mountain conceals the underground palace entrance. I merely... borrowed their circumstances.”

As their carriage halted before the magistrate’s yamen, Wang Jun announced to guards: “The honorable son of Magistrate Jiang from Qujiang City requests audience!”

Within, Magistrate Pang Guang—midday nap interrupted—grumbled to his concubine: “Likely imposters. Who travels so far unannounced?” Yet caution prevailed; he waddled out, obsequiously greeting the ornate carriage. “Young Master Jiang! What an unexpected honor!”
