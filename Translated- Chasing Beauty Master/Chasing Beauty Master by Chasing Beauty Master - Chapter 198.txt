“Let’s accompany Xiaojuan for some shopping. The commercial event is tomorrow,” Gao Wei said casually.

“Alright, let’s go. I’ll drive you,” Guan Yu replied, finishing the last sip of soy milk before standing to pay.

Their destination was Central Street—the same place Guan Yu had nearly met his end the previous night. It was a weekend, and the bustling crowds forced Guan Yu to circle for ages before finding parking.

Two adjacent spots remained. Guan Yu skillfully maneuvered his car into position, angling carefully to avoid blocking the neighboring space.

Halfway into the parking spot, a flashy red Ferrari sped into view through his rearview mirror. Guan Yu scoffed inwardly—if the driver was male, he’d surely be a show-off.

The Ferrari driver, spotting the two vacancies, accelerated recklessly toward the remaining spot beside Guan Yu’s Mercedes, seemingly desperate to claim it before others.

Guan Yu’s eyelid twitched. Was the driver overestimating his skills? At that speed in such tight space? His own car was already halfway in, leaving no room to reverse. Only a perfect drift could save the Ferrari now.

But Guan Yu overestimated the driver. The Ferrari scraped violently against his Mercedes as it swerved in.

The screech of metal grated on Guan Yu’s nerves, fueling his irritation. *What an idiot*, he thought.

Now, the two cars were wedged in a V-shape, neither able to advance nor retreat.

The Ferrari’s door flung open as the driver shouted, “Hey! How the hell are you driving?!”

**Chapter 490: I’m Her Boyfriend**

Guan Yu fumed. Who had he offended to encounter such a moron over parking? Worse, this fool now blamed *him*. He’d met idiots before, but none this delusional.

Unbuckling his seatbelt, Guan Yu stepped out and glared at the man—dressed in casual wear, oversized sunglasses obscuring most of his face.

Though hidden behind shades, Guan Yu sensed the hostility radiating from the man. Before Guan Yu could speak, the stranger snapped, “Do you even know how to drive? Look what you’ve done to my Ferrari! This is the latest model—you think you can afford to pay for this?!”

Guan Yu glanced at the collision. The Ferrari bore a long scratch, but his Mercedes fared worse: a jagged gash and a dent marred its sleek lines.

The sight stoked his anger. He’d only owned two cars. The first, a Hummer, had been wrecked by Lin Dong on the road to the capital. This Mercedes, borrowed from Li Xi, was now ruined within days—and by a brainless fool. Unforgivable.

He sneered, “Pay? *You’re* asking *me* to pay? If you hadn’t charged in like a lunatic, my car wouldn’t be like this!”

The man—Bo Jie—shrugged off responsibility. “If you hadn’t parked there, I’d have parked smoothly.”

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “Calling you an idiot is too generous.”

“You dare call *me* an idiot?” Bo Jie snarled. “Do you know who I am?”

“I don’t care if you’re the goddamn Emperor. You’re just a peacock strutting in a flashy car,” Guan Yu retorted.

Bo Jie trembled with rage. Accustomed to adoration, he’d never been insulted so brazenly. “Fine. The police will handle this. Prepare to pay!”

Confident in his influence, Bo Jie smirked, certain the authorities would side with him.

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Perfect. Let’s see who ends up paying.”

He welcomed police involvement. Given his standing in N City and the clear fault, he’d relish watching this fool’s schemes crumble.

As Bo Jie dialed the police, Du Xiaojuan and Gao Wei emerged from the Mercedes.

Gao Wei studied Bo Jie, frowning. His face seemed familiar, but she couldn’t place him.

Surveying the damage, she addressed Bo Jie calmly. “Involving the police won’t benefit you. We all saw you crash into us. Let’s settle this privately.”

Guan Yu frowned. They were in the right—why back down?

Du Xiaojuan, sensing his displeasure, whispered, “Husband, Sister Gao Wei wants to avoid scandal. As a public figure, rumors could harm her.”

Guan Yu sighed. Celebrity life was fraught with complications.

Bo Jie, meanwhile, stared at Gao Wei. Though her large sunglasses hid her face, her elegance and figure captivated him. After a prolonged gaze, he gasped. “Weiwei? Is that you?!”

Gao Wei tilted her head. “Do I know you?”

Bo Jie, who’d been relentlessly pursuing her, recognized her instantly. But Gao Wei, repelled by his advances, hadn’t bothered memorizing his face.

“It’s me! To think I’d meet you here on my first day in N City—fate must bind us!” Bo Jie removed his sunglasses, grinning.

“Bo Jie?” Gao Wei’s smile stiffened. “What a coincidence.”

“Destiny,” he declared.

Guan Yu finally recalled Bo Jie—the suitor Gao Wei had mentioned that morning. Without sunglasses, Bo Jie’s delicate handsomeness made Guan Yu inwardly scoff: *Pretty, but hardly manly.*

“N City’s tiny. Running into someone isn’t special—unless you’ve been stalking us,” Guan Yu taunted.

Bo Jie, euphoric at encountering Gao Wei, had forgotten their quarrel. Guan Yu’s jab reminded him.

“A friend of yours?” Bo Jie asked Gao Wei, ignoring Guan Yu.

She nodded subtly, shooting Guan Yu a pleading look: *Help me now.*

Guan Yu crossed his arms, mouthing: *You haven’t agreed to my terms.*

Gao Wei gritted her teeth. *This lecher…*

Bo Jie waved magnanimously. “Since he’s your friend, I’ll drop the matter. No need for compensation.”

Guan Yu’s eye twitched. *This bastard’s twisting the narrative!*

Smirking, Guan Yu slid an arm around Gao Wei’s waist. “Not just a friend. I’m her boyfriend.”

**Chapter 491: Such Shamelessness**

“Ha! I knew you were her friend… Wait, *boyfriend*?!” Bo Jie gaped.

Guan Yu tightened his grip on Gao Wei. “Problem?”

Bo Jie stared enviously at Guan Yu’s hand on her waist, then searched Gao Wei’s face for signs of deception. Her flushed cheeks and tender gaze, however, seemed genuine.

His confidence crumbled.

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu discreetly pinched Gao Wei’s waist. She glared, but to Bo Jie, it resembled playful flirtation.

“Must you flaunt your love?!” Bo Jie groaned.

Gao Wei, flustered, pulled away slightly. “Convinced now?”

Bo Jie sighed. “Fine. I believe you’re dating. But so what? A good digger can topple any wall. I’ll win her over eventually.”

He smirked. “I’ll see her daily on set. Proximity breeds affection. Can *you* stay by her side always?”

“Aren’t you the playboy Weiwei mentioned?” Guan Yu retorted.

Bo Jie wagged a finger. “My ‘playfulness’ proves honesty—I don’t cheat. Now that I’ve found *her*, I’ll change.”

Guan Yu stared, awed by the man’s audacity. Compared to this, his own confidence seemed modest.

Turning to Gao Wei, he joked, “Such devotion! Maybe give him a chance?”

She glared. Bo Jie’s persistence exceeded her worst fears.

Steeling herself, Gao Wei met Bo Jie’s gaze. “Stop wasting effort. I’m already Guan Yu’s woman.”

Guan Yu choked. *She went that far?!*

Bo Jie merely shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. I don’t mind.”

Both Guan Yu and Gao Wei staggered, dumbfounded.

“How thick *is* your face?” Guan Yu exclaimed.

**Chapter 492: Caught on Camera**

Guan Yu turned to Gao Wei. “*This* is a superstar?”

She nodded wearily, defeated by Bo Jie’s shamelessness.

Guan Yu massaged his temples. “Who’d fall for this lunatic?”

“It’s not lunacy—it’s dedication! You wouldn’t understand,” Bo Jie sniffed.

“Dedication? More like masochism,” Guan Yu spat.

“Husband, my legs are sore. Can we go?” Du Xiaojuan whined, seizing her chance to interrupt.

“Let’s shop,” Guan Yu said, eager to escape the farce.

“*Husband*?!” Bo Jie crowed. “I knew it! Weiwei, he’s a fake, right? Almost had me fooled!”
