“Heh, kid, if that's what you think, then you're truly blind to the grandeur before you. Have you heard of the Sacred Dragon Clan?”

“Sacred Dragon Clan?” Guan Yu pondered briefly before exclaiming, “You mean the clan whose power rivals the Human Sage Realm?!”

“Hoho, seems you’re not as dim as I thought. Correct. An adult Sacred Dragon typically matches a Human Sage Realm expert. But our clan also has many who rival the Human Emperor Realm. Though they’ve ascended to another dimension.”

Guan Yu was stunned. He’d heard of the dragons’ might but never imagined they could rival even Emperor Realm cultivators—beings so transcendent he’d be less than an ant before them. His gaze drifted to the miniature dragon before him, struggling to reconcile its frail form with such legends.

Noticing his doubt, the dragon snapped, “Brat! I see your disbelief. Don’t judge by appearances! Though weakened to a mere shadow, my power exceeds your pitiful comprehension.”

Flushing, Guan Yu asked, “What realm did you attain, senior? And… how did you end up like this?”

The dragon’s expression darkened. “I was the Nine-Star Sacred Dragon, our clan’s brightest hope to reach the Dragon God Realm. But during my ascension, I was betrayed. My spirit core shattered, leaving me unable to withstand the realm’s backlash. As the energy storms tore me apart, I detonated my body, hiding my soul within my Sacred Dragon Heart. The explosion hurled it outward… but my injuries were grave. I fell into slumber within the heart—until you found it and awakened me with your blood.”

Guan Yu’s heart raced. A Nine-Star Sacred Dragon! Equivalent to a Third-Stage Human Sage—just one step below Emperor Realm! This feeble creature had once been *that* powerful?

Seeing the awe in Guan Yu’s eyes, the dragon chided, “Enough gawking. With effort, you too might reach such heights. Henceforth, I am your mentor. Call me Bikamao. I’ll teach you to become a mighty Alchemist.”

“Alchemist? I’ve heard they’re formidable, but how does one become one?”

Bikamao grinned. “Their strength lies in prerequisites: first, becoming a powerful mage with *absolute* control over elemental forces—as natural as moving limbs. While many learn magic, true elemental mastery demands rare talent or… relentless training through Elemental Baptism.”

“Elemental Baptism?”

The dragon’s smirk returned. “You’ll learn when you reach Three-Star Mage. *Heh.*”

Guan Yu shivered at that grin. “Why do I feel like I’ve stepped into a trap…?”

“Enough chatter. My Sacred Dragon Heart within you aids your cultivation—but effort matters most.”

“I swear to persevere!”

“Good. The path is perilous. Self-reliance is key. You’re at Qi Refinement Stage Two. When you reach Martial Realm, I’ll teach you magic. Now, acquire three items: a Heavenly Spirit Grass, a Tier-2 Thunder Devourer’s Magic Core, and a Demon Spirit Herb. Common enough—but tell *no one* of my existence.”

With that, Bikamao vanished into Guan Yu’s chest.

**Chapter 1504: Heavenly Spirit Grass**

“Heavenly Spirit Grass?! Thunder Devourer Core?! Demon Spirit Herb?! Bikamao, are you mad?! I’m no prince! These cost over a thousand gold! My savings are barely five hundred—enough for *one* core!” Guan Yu shouted at his chest.

“Your problem, brat. Secure them, and you’ll reap rewards beyond imagination. Scrounge the coins!”

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu muttered, “Fine. I’ll manage…” Though exiled from his clan, his father Hu Xiaohai provided modest funds—twenty gold monthly, ample for commoners but paltry here.

“I’ll have to borrow…” Steeling himself, he approached Hu Xiaohai’s chamber.

“*Oof!*” Colliding with his father, Guan Yu stammered, “F-Father! I… need to borrow five hundred gold.”

Hu Xiaohai raised an eyebrow. “For what?”

“A Thunder Devourer Core, Heavenly Spirit Grass, and Demon Spirit Herb.”

Silence fell. Then Hu Xiaohai chuckled. “I’ve a spare core. The herbs… you’re on your own.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. “Truly?!”

“From last year’s hunt. Collect it from my room.”

Ecstatic, Guan Yu followed, acquiring the crackling core. “So this is a magic core! The herbs remain…”

As he departed, Hu Xiaohai tossed him a coin pouch. “Your allowance—advanced.”

Guan Yu’s gratitude turned to dismay. “You’re docking my future stipends?!”

“Complain later. Off with you.”

**Chapter 1505: Thunder Devourer Core**

In the bustling market, Guan Yu blanched at herb prices. Five hundred gold vanished for two plants. “Money evaporates…”

At a stall, he eyed another Thunder Devourer Core. “How much?”

“Eight hundred gold!”

Before Guan Yu could react, Bikamao hissed, *“Fraud. Yours is genuine. Leave.”*

Retreating, Guan Yu whispered, “Why’s it fake?”

“The elemental resonance’s off. Yours pulses with primal thunder. That’s a dyed Rock Lizard core.”

Guan Yu shuddered. “Glad I’ve yours…”

With ingredients secured, he smiled. *Time to see what Bikamao’s planning.*
