“Sir, I beg you to spare me. I know I was wrong. I’ll never dare again,” Young Master Zhang slurred through swollen lips, his entire body wracked with pain as if his bones were disintegrating. His head swam with dizziness, and the terror of impending death brought silent tears streaming down his bruised face, giving him the pitiful appearance of grievously wronged child finally tasting retribution.

The crowd murmured as Guanyu rose with grim satisfaction. “Your pleas come too late—truly, one only repents when staring at the coffin,” he said coldly. “I’ll be visiting the City Lord’s residence shortly. If Lord Zhang has grievances, let him seek me directly. I’ll await him.”

Spectators exchanged awed whispers. Some marveled at Guanyu’s unparalleled martial prowess, having never witnessed such a formidable master. Others rejoiced inwardly, thinking, *At last, someone has punished that arrogant beast! How gratifying!*

Not a soul among the onlookers sympathized with the whimpering Young Master—a testament to how deeply the Zhang family’s tyranny had festered. A few even yearned to applaud Guanyu, for the City Lord and his son had oppressed commoners and harassed women for years. Yet fear kept their hands still; none dared risk the family’s vengeful memory.

Left half-dead in the dirt, Young Master Zhang resembled a broken doll. Guanyu’s earlier strike had carried deliberate force—a lesson meant to brand itself upon the wretch’s soul. When soldiers eventually dragged their master away like garbage, it was mercy Guanyu hadn’t ended him outright.

Returning to Wang Xiaorong, who had just finished devouring a juicy peach, Guanyu nodded. “Done here. Let’s head back.”

“Good,” she said, brushing fruit juice from her fingers. “Next we face Lord Zhang. I wouldn’t mind removing a corrupt City Lord from office.”

Turning to the elderly performer, Guanyu advised, “Old sir, take your granddaughter and leave this place at once. That vermin’s breed never reforms—he’ll resume his evils once healed.”

The old man patted his granddaughter’s hand thoughtfully. “Honored warrior, if your martial brother shares your prowess... might we visit him? My granddaughter—”

“Grandfather!” The girl gripped his sleeve in alarm. “I’ll never marry! I’ll care for you and Grandmother always!”

Guanyu brightened. “Truly? Splendid! My brother is indeed remarkable—he’d be delighted by your granddaughter’s excellence!”

The old man’s motives were simple: secure his Qiqi’s future with a decent man, ensuring safety over wealth. At her marriageable age, he couldn’t chain her to their dwindling years. Though Guanyu himself seemed ideal—skilled, virtuous—his betrothed’s presence and age difference discouraged hopes. Perhaps the brother would suffice.

“Qiqi,” the grandfather coaxed, “we can’t shackle your youth. Visit this man—if unsuited, we’ll refuse.”

“I won’t! My place is with you!” Qiqi protested until Guanyu intervened: “Miss Qiqi, your grandparents can’t shelter you forever. My brother’s character is impeccable—he’d help care for them, ending your street performances. He’s wealthy enough to support your family.”

This struck home. Their nomadic life—battling heat, frost, and hunger while funding Grandmother’s medicines through precarious street shows—had worn the old couple thin. Qiqi’s resolve wavered at the promise of stability.

Since childhood, the orphaned girl had honed acrobatic skills through grueling practice, her calloused hands juggling blades while others played with dolls. Grandmother’s worsening illness demanded constant travel in their rickety cart, surviving on meager coins tossed by rare kind souls. Nights often meant empty bellies and patched clothes, yet Qiqi never complained—only drilled her routines harder.

Wang Xiaorong arched an eyebrow at Guanyu’s promises. While Red Blade’s six hundred mercenaries strained their funds, perhaps scraps from their coffers could sustain two elders. The girl’s desperate hope pricked her conscience.

Under dual persuasion, Qiqi finally relented. “We’ll... visit,” she whispered.

“Excellent!” Guanyu clapped. “Let’s depart—I’ve urgent matters.”

As they loaded their performance cart, Qiqi asked shyly, “Great warrior, what shall we call you?”

“Most know me as Old Cang,” he smiled. “This is Xiaorong-jie.”

“Old Cang Big Brother! Xiaorong Sister!” Qiqi chirped, oblivious to how the “Old” rankled him.

Her next plea surprised them: “Teach me your skills! I’d protect Grandfather!”

Guanyu hesitated—true mastery required years, not casual lessons—but the grandfather’s hopeful gaze softened his refusal. “When time allows,” he conceded, sparking the girl’s joy.

At the inn, urgency gripped Guanyu. “Where’s Third Captain? Emergency!”

Zou Wuhui emerged, startling him. “Old Cang? What crisis?”

“Why aren’t you guarding the Prince?” Guanyu demanded. With only reckless Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun as protection, the Prince sat vulnerable.

“His Highness sent me to distribute payments,” Zou explained. “What’s wrong?”

“Lord Zhang is Second Prince’s lackey! Retrieve the Prince immediately—the residence isn’t safe!”

As they mobilized, Qiqi and her grandfather exchanged awed glances. These were players in imperial intrigues far beyond their dusty troupe.

Red Blade descended the stairs, jingling a new coin purse. “Drinks on me, Old Cang! Let’s—”

“Trouble brews,” Guanyu cut in. To the bewildered performers, he was now an enigma—a peerless warrior entangled with royalty, his strange blade hinting at secrets no street artist could unravel. The grandfather’s keen eyes noted every detail, wondering what storms this mysterious benefactor might bring into their fragile lives.
