Guan Yu self-mockingly twitched his nose, then suddenly felt a surge of childlike mischief. He stepped closer to Wen Ya with a smile resembling a big bad wolf luring Little Red Riding Hood, and said slyly, "I helped you resolve such a big problem. Shouldn't you give me some reward?"

"Shameless!" Wen Ya gritted her teeth, suddenly kicking toward Guan Yu's crotch. Her swift and decisive move surprised him.

But Guan Yu was no Ji Chengfeng. Such a sneak attack meant nothing to him. He effortlessly caught Wen Ya's ankle, admiring its delicate curve. "Another pair of beautiful feet," he mused inwardly.

"Let go!" Wen Ya seethed, struggling violently. As she yanked her ankle free, she lost balance and fell backward.

"Ah!" Her cry startled Guan Yu from his reverie. He swiftly caught her slender waist, pulling her into his embrace.

Holding a beauty in his arms, even a saint would be tempted. At that moment, the door opened to reveal another stunning woman—Wen Qing—who smirked at the scene. "Seems I came at the wrong time. Don't mind me," she said, closing the door behind her.

"Release me!" Wen Ya erupted, thrashing wildly. Her struggles only heightened the friction between them, testing Guan Yu's restraint.

"Damn, you bite like a dog!" Guan Yu cursed, dropping Wen Ya onto the sofa. He glared at the teeth marks on his arm. "What was I thinking, provoking her like this?"

"I was just joking. Did you have to go that far?" Guan Yu sighed.

"What do you want?" Wen Ya snapped.

"If I were like Ji Chengfeng, you wouldn't have lasted this long," Guan Yu retorted. "Stay here as manager. You need the money."

"Never!" Wen Ya stormed out, distrusting his motives.

Later, Guan宇 met Mo Ling, who had returned after enduring months of hardship. Their reunion was emotional, with Mo Ling tearfully embracing him. "I thought I'd never see you again!"

"Don't worry. No one will keep us apart now," Guan宇 assured her.

Their moment was interrupted by Jiang Ziqi, whose arrogant taunts provoked Guan宇. Without hesitation, Guan宇 threw Jiang Ziqi out into the street, leaving him humiliated.

Over lunch, Mo Ling laughed heartily. "You should've hit him harder!"

"Next time," Guan宇 promised. "We'll make sure to bring a camera."
