However, the Left Envoy currently had no solutions. Making the Young Master return with him was clearly unrealistic, and preventing Guan Yu from protecting Prince Zou remained equally impossible. Thus, the Left Envoy found himself at an impasse.

Perhaps there was nothing to worry about. When Prince Zou's adversaries arrived, even if the Young Master faced danger, he wouldn't be harmed by their own people.

The Left Envoy said, “I can help you secure this matter, but I remain concerned for the Young Master’s safety. I know there’s no better solution now. However, the Demon Lord also commanded that the Young Master must not be taken to the desert.”

“Very well. I promise you,” Guan Yu replied. “Before heading to the desert, I’ll ensure Xiaorong is safely returned to the Demon Soul Sect.”

Wang Xiaorong hurriedly interjected, “I refuse! I’m going to the desert with you!”

Guan Yu waved his hand dismissively. These were matters for later. For now, he’d comply with their arrangement. Who knew what circumstances might arise when they actually ventured into the desert? There was no point dwelling on it now.

“Rest assured,” Guan Yu said. “I’ll protect Xiaorong with my life. Even without the Demon Lord’s orders, her safety is my responsibility. Her security is intertwined with mine. Though our journey may be perilous, I’ll strive to safeguard everyone.”

Hearing these words, Wang Xiaorong’s heart swelled with emotion. She adored when Guan Yu spoke so considerately, finding his words deeply comforting and warm.

**Chapter 4079: You’ll Regret It**

The Left Envoy nodded. He trusted Guan Yu’s character and acknowledged his capabilities. With the Demon Lord’s covert reinforcements now withdrawn, the Left Envoy resolved to personally shadow them in secret if necessary.

“We must return to Ha’er City promptly,” Guan Yu urged. “We depart at dawn tomorrow. No further delays.”

“Wherever you go, I’ll follow,” Wang Xiaorong declared tenderly.

The Left Envoy had no further instructions for Guan Yu, confident in his ability to protect Wang Xiaorong.

After Guan Yu’s meticulous disguise, Wang Xiaorong became unrecognizable. The transformation was essential—her presence in Prince Zou’s entourage would spell trouble for both the Demon Soul Sect and Guan Yu.

The art of disguise proved invaluable. Guan Yu had prepared a beast-hide mask for her. Though it made her appear less striking and slightly older, Wang Xiaorong adored it, appreciating the added security.

Time had grown late. By the time Guan Yu rode his crimson steed back to Dar City, dawn had broken. A crowd had gathered outside the inn, puzzling Guan Yu initially.

Approaching, he realized it was Prince Zou’s retinue. Though disorganized, the group’s overall strength had markedly increased.

“You’re back.” Wang Jun greeted Guan Yu with a smile. Zou Wuxiao stood nearby, indifferent to Guan Yu but intrigued by his horse.

“Where’d you get such a fine steed, Lao Cang?” Zou Wuxiao reached to touch the horse, which snorted irritably.

“Feisty one, isn’t it?” Zou Wuxiao remarked.

“This horse has a fiery temper. Only I can ride him,” Guan Yu said, dismounting and assisting Wang Xiaorong.

Noticing their closeness, Zou Wuxiao grinned. “Seems your outing was fruitful, Lao Cang! A fine horse and a beauty? Where’d you find her?”

“We’ve been acquainted long before this,” Guan Yu replied. “Care to test my horse? See if you can ride him.”

Before Prince Zou emerged, Zou Wuxiao swaggered forward. “If I succeed, will you gift him to me?”

“Certainly,” Guan Yu agreed. Wang Xiaorong frowned, reluctant to part with the magnificent steed.

“And if you fail?” Guan Yu countered.

“Name your terms,” Zou Wuxiao challenged.

“Promise me one favor, unspecified for now. A man’s word is his bond.”

“Agreed!” Zou Wuxiao leapt onto the saddle. Initially calm, the horse suddenly reared violently, bucking wildly. Zou Wuxiao clung desperately, but the steed bolted forward, ultimately flinging him meters away.

**Chapter 4080: Changing Tastes**

Amidst uproarious laughter, Guan Yu retrieved his horse. “Told you he’s unrideable.”

“I yield,” a dust-covered Zou Wuxiao groaned. “Nearly killed me!”

Wang Xiaorong chided, “Stubborn fool! You’ve exhausted Little Red.” Guan Yu winced at her naming the majestic stallion “Little Red.”

Though Wang Jun hadn’t initially recognized the disguised Wang Xiaorong, her voice betrayed her. Guan Yu had briefed her to address him as Lao Cang and maintain their cover as father and children.

“Er Yatou,” Wang Xiaorong ordered Wang Jun, “feed Little Red premium fodder. He’s gone all night without eating.”

Xiao Zhi approached, eyeing Wang Xiaorong curiously. “Since when did you change preferences, Guan Yu? Where’d she come from?”

“Quiet!” Guan Yu hissed. “She’s a companion for our mission. Ask no more.”

Regarding the assembled forces, Guan Yu inquired, “All recruits?”

“Some by Zou Wuxiao, others hired by Zou Wuhui,” Xiao Zhi confirmed. “Said to be capable, but who knows?”

When Prince Zou emerged, Guan Yu presented Wang Xiaorong. “Your Highness, my friend joins our escort.”

“Excellent,” Prince Zou approved. “Rest at the inn. We’ll depart at noon.”

Guan Yu accepted gratefully, knowing Wang Xiaorong needed respite after their journey.

**Chapter 4081: Fearless**

In their chamber, Wang Xiaorong marveled at the feast. “So lavish! The prince spares no expense.”

Alone, she embraced Guan Yu. “I’m thrilled to adventure with you! Father kept me cooped up forever!”

“He means well,” Guan Yu said gently. “The Red Lotus Sect seeks vengeance after we took the Myriad Phenomena Disk. Your safety concerns him.”

“Since when do you defend Father?” Wang Xiaorong teased before exclaiming, “My crossbow! Where is it?”

Guan Yu produced the compact weapon. “Handle carefully. Its bolts are mercury-tipped—toxic. Store them in the leather pouch.”

Eagerly testing it, Wang Xiaorong fired at the doorframe just as Wang Jun entered. The thudding bolt sent him ducking.

“Attempted murder?!” he yelped.

Ignoring him, Wang Xiaorong cheered, “Incredible power! With this, I fear nothing!”

Guan Yu advised, “Practice reloading and aim. Use it as a hidden weapon.”

“Understood! I love it!” she beamed.

Wang Jun complained, “Might you acknowledge visitors? Nearly took my head off!”

“Join us,” Guan Yu offered.

As they ate, Wang Jun whispered, “Truth—where’d you find her?”

Guan Yu deflected, “Focus on the mission.”

Wang Xiaorong interjected, “With this crossbow, I’m invincible!” Her eyes shone with excitement, the weapon’s weight reassuring in her hands.
