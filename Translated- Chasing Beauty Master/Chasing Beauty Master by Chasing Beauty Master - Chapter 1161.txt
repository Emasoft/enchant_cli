Guan Yu knew exactly what he was doing. What he wanted now was for Yang Conghan to make a choice—whether to side with the Yang Family or himself. This decision had to be hers alone. His aloofness toward her was precisely to grant her the time and opportunity to make this choice.

Yang Conghan watched Guan Yu drinking upstairs, her thoughts in turmoil. Uncertain of his true feelings, she ascended the stairs and stood beside him.

Guan Yu raised his cup with nonchalant amusement. “What? Care for a drink?” The question was casual, filling the silence between them.

To his surprise, Yang Conghan snatched the glass from his hand and downed its contents in one gulp.

“Cough! Cough! Cough!”

She had never consumed such strong liquor before—at most sipping wine during celebrations. The fiery liquid burned her throat mercilessly, sending her into a fit of coughing.

Guan Yu immediately stood to pat her back. “Jingjing, fetch water! Why would you torment yourself like this?”

Between ragged breaths, Yang Conghan fixed him with a plaintive gaze. At twenty, she yearned for marriage like other women of prominent families. How she wished to hear him speak of wedding her!

“This liquor is potent. Drinking so recklessly harms the body,” Guan Yu chided, supporting her as she struggled for air.

Unfamiliar with such spirits, Yang Conghan had acted impulsively in her frustration. Now regret flooded her as flames seared from throat to stomach.

Xue Jing arrived with water. After several gulps, the coughing subsided.

“Sister Conghan, are you alright?”

Yang Conghan shook her head. “Guan Yu,” she rasped, “you knew this confrontation would ruin my club. Why choose here?”

Guan Yu scratched his head, marveling at her sharpness—so reminiscent of Jin Hua’s cunning. He had anticipated the battle with Xiang Jiamian would devastate the Night Blossom Club. Waiting here instead of returning to Yu Gang’s base had been deliberate, testing Yang Conghan’s stance toward him.

Though pleased with her reaction, now wasn’t the time for revelations. The blood debt owed to Jin Hua’s annihilated clan loomed large. By nurturing Yang Conghan’s loyalty now, he aimed to plant seeds that would one day overshadow her familial bonds. Only then could he exact vengeance.

“Don’t blame me,” Guan Yu feigned innocence. “My bar was wrecked. I came here merely to root out a spy. How could I foresee Bill Lin sending so many men?”

“Save your excuses,” Yang Conghan croaked, throat raw. “I didn’t come to accuse you.”

She had meant to say “I came to see you,” but the final word lodged in her throat.

**Chapter 2,974: Hold Your Tongue**

Xue Jing glared at Guan Yu. “Must you act without thinking? That money—”

“What’s wrong? She asked for twenty million. It’s just money—I’ll replenish Yu Gang’s coffers later.”

“Do I need your charity?” Yang Conghan retorted. “The money wasn’t the point!”

“Then what?”

“You—”

Xue Jing interjected angrily: “She came to see you! The money was just an excuse after missing you!”

Guan Yu played dumb. “I compensated her. What more should I do?”

“She wants care, not cash!” Xue Jing shouted.

Yang Conghan stormed out, ignoring Xue Jing’s pleas. When silence returned, Xue Jing rounded on Guan Yu. “Why hurt her? She clearly longed to meet you!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “How was I to know? Ask her why she left.” Secret plans required discretion—even from trusted allies.

After arranging repairs for the club through Hou Jinshun, Guan Yu distributed rewards at Yu Gang’s base. Wei Hongwei presented an opulent fur-lined chair—a throne fitting their leader.

“Fine work,” Guan Yu approved, cutting short the flattery. He allocated funds: ten thousand per member, double for standout performers. Wang Hu was dispatched with payments for Jones’ mercenaries.

Later, Jia Bo reported: “Ma Tong transferred forces from southern Miao Hui Tang. Their purpose here with Bill Lin remains unclear.”

Guan Yu nodded. Vigilance was paramount.

Days later, Lai Huangsi returned to the leather factory. Lan Ting beamed at their completed order. “Quality and integrity define us,” she declared, though privately scoffing at Guan Yu’s earlier paranoia.

The new contract made her gasp—30,000 tons in six months. “The timeline is impossible!”

Lai Huangsi waved dismissively. “Merely motivational clauses. We’ll extend deadlines if needed.” Remembering Guan Yu’s instructions, Lan Ting excused herself to call him.

Following prearranged plans, she signed.

At the Feng Estate, Bill Lin rejoiced. “Three hundred million in penalties! Finally, Guan Yu walks into our trap!”

Feng Shaoye frowned. “Would he be so careless?”

“The contract’s airtight!” Bill Lin crowed. “That dark-skinned manager never consulted him. By the time they notice our product thefts, it’ll be too late!”

Sun Xu grinned. “Daily production will bleed them dry. Guan Yu won’t recover.”

Laughter echoed through the hall—sweet vengeance brewing drop by stolen drop.
