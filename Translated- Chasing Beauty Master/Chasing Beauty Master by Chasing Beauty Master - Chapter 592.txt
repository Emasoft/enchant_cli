Just as Guan Lei finished speaking, Guan Yu's suspicions grew. The Kirin Elixir was a tribute intended for the Emperor—who would dare intercept it? For years, the Guan family had overseen its transportation without incident. Why had this happened precisely when the Grand Elder rejected Li Chuang's proposal?

"Uncle Guan Lei," Guan Yu voiced his doubts, "our family has safeguarded the Kirin Elixir's transport for decades without mishap. Why was it intercepted now? Who would dare rob an imperial tribute? Moreover, this occurred shortly after the Grand Elder refused the Li family's marriage proposal. Doesn't the clan find this suspicious?"

Guan Lei sighed heavily. "The Grand Elder shares your suspicions. But all the escorts were slaughtered—not even their bodies remained. Without evidence, we cannot act. Those escorts were our finest. Logically, the Li family alone couldn't have overwhelmed them. Our families are evenly matched. Had the Lis attacked, at least one of our men should have escaped to warn us. Yet none survived. This makes the Grand Elder question whether the Lis truly acted alone. If they did, they must have conspired long in advance with outside help. This disaster has crippled our clan's vitality—we lost our elite!"

Sorrow clouded Guan Lei's eyes. Guan Yu paled, realizing the Lis had colluded with external forces. If their goal was merely to force Xueyan into marriage, such elaborate scheming seemed excessive—something far darker brewed beneath. Yet without proof, he kept silent.

"If the Lis indeed conspire against us," interjected Guan Xiao beside them, "forcing Xueyan's marriage is but a minor move in a greater plot."

Guan Yu turned to his father in admiration. "As expected of my old man—you've guessed my very thoughts."

"Indeed," Guan Lei nodded. "The Grand Elder and clan leader anticipate larger schemes. They've ordered heightened vigilance—no solitary travels, doubled guards. The slightest disturbance will be detected." He then gazed at Xueyan in his arms. "My child, I beg your forgiveness. For the clan's survival, you must wed into the Li family."

Xueyan, pressed against her father's chest, understood the gravity. To refuse now would doom their clan. After a weighted silence, she lifted her head resolutely. "I obey, Father. For our family's sake, I'll wed as commanded. Let us return."

**Chapter 1501: How Many Young Geniuses Have There Been Since Ancient Times?**

Xueyan clasped Guan Lei's hand, leading him out. Fearing her change of heart, Guan Lei strode briskly. As the pair departed, Guan Yu's mother moved to speak, but Guan Xiao restrained her. When Guan Yu tried pursuing them, his father blocked him.

"Let it rest," Guan Xiao admonished their bewildered stares. "Interference worsens matters. I shall journey abroad soon—you two must stay vigilant."

Guan Yu knew his father meant to investigate the Lis' collaborators. Though Guan Xiao had left the main family, clan blood still bound him. Watching his sister walk into the wolves' den, Guan Yu cursed his helplessness. Determination flared—he would seize his father's absence to sneak out and train.

Facing imminent danger, Guan Yu taunted boldly: "Oh? Playing tough now? Think I fear empty threats?"

As tensions peaked, Huo Lingling intervened with a laugh: "Enough! My father approaches."

In the distance, Sect Master Huo Zhentian and Elder Suoluo advanced with dozens of disciples. Compelled by authority, Wu Yuying sheathed her sword, glaring at Guan Yu. "Little lecher—today's reprieve is temporary. Cross me again, and not even heaven will save you!"

Passing Lingling, Yuying softened: "I've watched you grow, little sister. Don't let this scoundrel cloud your judgment. Worthy men abound beyond our sect."

Lingling giggled. "Thank you, Sister Yuying. But I'm still young for such matters."

"Why does she oppose you so?" Lingling later asked Guan Yu.

He sighed. "More walls than roads ahead, it seems."

Approaching footsteps interrupted—Huo Zhentian and Suoluo arrived. "Young Guan Yu, did Yuying trouble you?" the Sect Master inquired.

"None at all," Guan Yu replied, noting the man's anticipatory tone.

Suoluo chuckled. "We expected her visit, but didn't orchestrate it. Yuying heeds no commands."

Changing subjects, Guan Yu gestured to Yuying's companion. "Elder Suoluo, who's that man with her?"

"Unfamiliar." Suoluo indicated a woman beside him. "May I present Miss Liu Piaopiao of Radiant Auction House? The spirit liquid you acquired came through her—in a sense, your benefactor."

Guan Yu recognized her from the auction. Before he could speak, Piaopiao cooed: "Master Guan Yu, though we meet anew, I feel an ancient kinship. Could we have crossed paths in past lives?"

Her words danced with double meanings. "Rumor claims you dazzled in recent trials—Hun Tian Sect's brightest genius in decades. I long to witness your prowess firsthand."

Guan Yu's expression tightened. This woman sought to pry into his secrets. Deflecting, he smiled: "You flatter me. True genius resides in Lingling here."

"Oh? So your sect truly births prodigies as whispered?"

"Geniuses? Let's say... promising talents. But what standards measure your gaze, Miss Liu?"

**Chapter 1502: Return to Demon Night Forest**

At dawn, Guan Yu slipped into Demon Night Forest. Recent sightings of fifth-tier magical beasts kept him cautious, patrolling peripheries for rare herbs. Finding none by midday, he settled in seclusion to cultivate—urgent need to break through Qi Condensation into Martial Realm and form his Core. Only then could true strength begin.

Nightfall found him exhaling turbid air, roaring at the sky: "I WILL GROW STRONGER!"

Startled birds erupted from trees. As Guan Yu watched their flight, resolve hardened his gaze.

"Needy lad, are we?" A raspy voice echoed from nowhere.

Whirling, Guan Yu scanned empty woods. The voice chuckled: "Foolish child—look inward."

Beneath his sternum, faint light pulsed from the mysterious stone heart embedded there. Guan Yu gaped. "Who... what are you?"

"Names matter not. Let's say we're... symbiotic. Your reckless swordplay killed you once. My awakening through your blood forged this bond. Be grateful—I preserve your existence."

Horror flashed—parasitic tales ending in host deaths. The entity scoffed: "I need no pathetic vessel. Your ambitions intrigue me. Seek power?"

Though wary, Guan Yu's heartbeat quickened. "Can you truly aid me?"

"Your ascent benefits us both. How about... becoming an alchemist?"

Guan Yu stiffened. "Alchemy demands rare gifts. Few qualify..."

A dazzling light burst forth, materializing into a palm-sized dragon. Guan Yu stumbled back, awestruck.

"Behold my true form!" the creature preened. "First mortal witness in millennia—revel in this honor!"

"But... dragons are colossal! You're..."

"Size denotes not strength," the mini-dragon sniffed. "Even among my kind, hierarchies exist."

Guan Yu eyed it skeptically. "Are you from... the weaker caste?"
