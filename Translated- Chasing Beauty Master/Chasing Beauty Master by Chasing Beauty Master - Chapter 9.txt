Guan Yu chuckled, leaning against the wall with arms crossed as he remarked leisurely, "Will fear help you escape? We must face this sooner or later. Though they appear numerous and ferocious, all men fear death. Make them hurt enough, and they'll flee at your shadow forever."

"Seems you've got experience..." Mo Ling smiled faintly, arching an eyebrow.

"Why did you choose this university? Because Sister Shilei teaches here?" Her curiosity surfaced.

Guan Yu sniffed self-deprecatingly, "Partly for a girl... But it matters little. Any university suffices for experiencing campus life. Besides," he grinned roguishly, "this place has plenty of beauties!"

"Tsk—such shallow ambitions." Mo Ling pursed her lips, shooting him an amused glance.

After half an hour's idle chat, Mo Ling rose to leave. When escorting her downstairs, both froze—the hostel gate stood shut with rolling shutter drawn. The night attendant had vanished into some room.

"This..." Mo Ling's delicate face fell as she stared imploringly at Guan Yu.

"Don't look at me—I'm helpless too!" He shrugged helplessly.

"Oh no! The school gates must be closing too! What shall we do?" She paced like an ant on hot bricks, anxiety coloring her voice.

"Stay in my room tonight."

"And you?" She tilted her head suspiciously.

"I'll manage on the chair." He waved dismissively.

With reluctant nod, Mo Ling agreed. Following her upstairs, Guan Yu's gaze lingered on the alluring curve below her slender waist. Unbidden, the bathroom incident resurfaced in his mind.

Ahem—mere coincidence, he chastised himself, shaking his head to dispel improper thoughts.

Entering the sparse single room—one bed, one chair—Mo Ling hovered uncertainly before perching on the bed's edge. "Only one chair. How will you sleep?"

"It's fine." Guan Yu smiled reassuringly.

Mo Ling's scrutiny swept over him before she removed her shoes. Her dainty feet in flesh-toned socks caught Guan Yu's stare. Caught red-handed, both flushed crimson.

"Enjoying the view, pervert?" She huffed, tucking her feet under blankets.

"Didn't... see clearly," he stammered.

"What?" She burst into incredulous laughter, cheeks blooming anew. "Lights out," she ordered as Guan Yu moved to switch them off.

"Keep them on," she amended softly.

In the amber glow, Guan Yu's gaze traced her profile—trembling lashes betraying wakefulness. Minutes later, Mo Ling turned, meeting his stare.

"Uncomfortable there? Join me on bed."

As he hesitated, she blushed fiercely. "No funny ideas! Sister Shilei's your cousin—behave or I'll throttle you!"

"Wouldn't dream of it," he lied, approaching cautiously.

Lying side-by-side yet divided by chaste distance, tension crackled. When Mo Ling requested darkness, plunging them into blackness, accidental contact occurred—Guan Yu's hand brushing hers.

"Stay proper," she warned as he settled beside her.

The scent of jasmine enveloped him. Though maintaining decorum, Mo Ling's restless movements gradually erased the gap—her arm draping his chest, knee brushing his thigh. Guan Yu's pulse thundered as soft curves pressed against him through thin fabric.

When her leg hooked his waist, his restraint neared breaking. Her breath fanned his face, twenty centimeters between their lips. Suppressing primal urges, he carefully disentangled himself—only for her to nestle into his chest moments later.

After agonizing hours, Guan Yu retreated to the chair. Moonlight outlined Mo Ling's silhouette through clingy leggings. Desperate for relief, he slipped into the bathroom.

Mid-attempt, the door creaked open. Mo Ling sleepwalked in, mechanically unbuttoning her pants. Guan Yu froze as black curls flashed beneath peach-hued lace.

Her scream pierced the air. "Pervert! Out!"

"It's not—"

"OUT!" She recoiled, clutching clothes.

Later, pounding the bathroom door, Guan Yu pleaded, "You walked in half-asleep! I was already—"

"Liar!" Mo Ling's muffled voice held tears. Crouched on cold tiles, she cursed her sleepwalking habit and this cursed night.
