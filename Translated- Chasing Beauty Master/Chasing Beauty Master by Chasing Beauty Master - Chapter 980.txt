“For future auctions, one can also purchase viewing tickets to watch the live broadcast in designated screening rooms. When the auction begins, large screens in these rooms will stream the event live. Tickets cost five hundred yuan per person.

The Yang family had long anticipated today’s overwhelming turnout. They vacated all screening rooms to sell auction viewing tickets. True to expectations, countless visitors came to purchase tickets, which sold out early in the morning. Moreover, numerous scalpers resold tickets at inflated prices, profiting from the差价.

The underground second floor required special access. Given today’s high-value auction items, many police officers were present to maintain order. The Yang family also stationed numerous enforcers to prevent troublemakers from causing disruptions.

The auction was set to begin at nine o'clock. Many prominent figures had already arrived through VIP channels, including Qu Guandao. Though Qu had recently been poisoned by Ying Shangu’s venomous centipede, timely treatment and his considerable cultivation base ensured his recovery. Determined to acquire the treasure map, he arrived early.

As the auction hall gradually filled, attendees maintained decorum. Everyone understood those present were either wealthy or influential. No one wished to offend powerful figures, so even old acquaintances conversed in hushed tones.

Ying Shangu arrived unannounced. Though widely avoided outdoors due to her notorious reputation, her formidable status in the jianghu and substantial wealth guaranteed her entry. Other eccentric attendees included elders from ancient sects dressed in archaic robes, as if filming a period drama. Ying Shangu glared at them contemptuously.

For instance, several figures in the far corner wore “Crotch-Covering Sect” costumes straight from television dramas. “If mountain sect rules require such attire, fine—but must you parade through the city like this? Why not change into modern clothes? Pretentious fools!” Ying Shangu fumed inwardly. “So-called Taoists chasing treasure maps and wealth... If distant rural sects learned of this map, there must be urban temples involved.”

Though the auction hall wasn’t large, it accommodated over two hundred seats below the podium. As nine o'clock approached, Guan Yu arrived with Xue Jing. The VIP entrance led through a rear elevator guarded by police and Yang family bodyguards. Rumor suggested an even more concealed passage for transporting auction items—evidence of the Yangs’ meticulous operation. Upon entering, Guan Yu noted over half the seats were occupied.

Attendees exuded refinement—handsome men and beautiful women speaking softly. Guan Yu raised an eyebrow at the presence of bald monks. “Do monks collect antiques now?” he mused. Then he recalled modern monasteries’ wealth, with tycoons donating luxury cars and villages. Their interest in a treasure map auction seemed inevitable.

**Chapter 2506: The Great Sword**

Guan Yu found his seat as an elderly man stepped onto the podium—none other than the Yang family’s steward, Xu. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Xu announced, “our auction commences promptly. Seven items will be auctioned today. Bidders may raise their numbered paddles. Let us begin with the first item.”

House lights dimmed as stage lights brightened, illuminating each lot. Screens before every seat displayed close-up camera angles of auctioned items. Two attendants wheeled out a red-draped cart bearing a rectangular wooden case.

“Our first item,” the announcer declared, “is a privately-owned Song Dynasty sword, passed down through generations. Despite centuries, its edge remains keen. Scientists confirm its blade comprises an extraterrestrial metal—uniquely hard yet flexible. The 92-centimeter blade...”

Guan Yu studied the silver-hued sword, its blade and hilt forged from a single metal piece—a marvel of ancient craftsmanship. Yet in modern times, such weapons held little practical use. Most attendees seemed disinterested—except Ying Shangu, who caught Guan Yu’s eye and nodded with a cryptic smile.

Guan Yu wondered how she’d recovered overnight from bullet wounds. Perhaps she possessed superior healing methods beyond modern science—a possibility he didn’t doubt.

“The opening bid is five million RMB,” concluded the announcer, “with minimum increments of two hundred thousand.”

Guan Yu considered this undervalued. A unique Song-era sword of mysterious alloy should command at least fifty million. Yet bidding commenced rapidly—500, 700, 900 million... Within minutes, it reached fourteen million. As bids slowed, Ying Shangu abruptly raised her paddle: “Twenty million!”

Qu Guandao shot her a sidelong glance. “Idiot,” he thought. “Spending millions on an obsolete sword? Practicing tai chi swordplay? Useless in this age.”

The crowd stared—some baffled, others scornful. As the auctioneer raised his gavel, Guan Yu suddenly shouted: “Thirty million!”

Every head turned. Even Xue Jing looked surprised. Ying Shangu’s eyes flashed with fury—her sure victory stolen. Auction rules forbade confrontations, so she coldly countered: “Thirty-five million!”

Guan Yu smirked but refrained from further bids. Let her overspend. The gavel fell—Ying Shangu secured the sword at 35 million, secretly pleased. The pure mithril blade’s toxicity would enhance her venomous creatures’ cultivation—worth every extra coin.

Subsequent lots—antiques, paintings, ceramics—saw mixed results. Two failed to sell; others found collectors. Finally, the announcer proclaimed: “Our final item!”

A ceiling panel opened, lowering a pedestal bearing an ornate wooden box. Inside lay a rolled parchment scrap. “This treasure map fragment,” the announcer said, “is auctioned with full disclosure—its authenticity unverified. The Yang patriarch, wishing to avoid worldly conflicts, sets the opening bid at one RMB. Let fate decide its owner.”

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Cameras zoomed on the sealed scroll. Guan Yu nodded approvingly—by pricing it symbolically, the Yangs absolved themselves of future disputes. Now began the true battle for the map’s secrets.
