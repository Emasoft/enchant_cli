In truth, her words weren't mistaken. She wasn't merely unugly—her beauty could rival Wen Qing's, though their styles differed.

Wen Qing embodied the elegant young mistress with playful charm, while Mu Xiyan presented an outwardly vivacious demeanor that concealed an inner willfulness typical of pampered heiresses.

Comparatively, each possessed unique merits. Ordinary folk would struggle to declare one superior.

"Apologies, Miss Mu," Wen Qing interjected sweetly, "but my husband has us companions already. Perhaps you should consider that Song gentleman accompanying you?"

"You mean him..."

Mu Xiyan glanced back at the glowering Song Shaoqin. "He's my brother. Impossible."

This revelation piqued Guan Yu's curiosity. Their earlier arrival together had suggested intimacy, yet now...

Strange. Given Mu Xiyan's striking looks, why would Song spurn her? Unless...the man suffered certain inadequacies?

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, this was classic unrequited affection—Song's devotion to Mu being common knowledge in their circle, while she maintained strictly fraternal feelings. Song's anguish stemmed from confusion: as a prime specimen among Beijing's elite in both looks and lineage, why did Mu remain indifferent?

Now witnessing Mu's shameless propositioning of Guan Yu—however insincere—Song's thunderous expression promised violence.

"Poor Master Song," clucked Gu Jiayan nearby.

As Song glared daggers, Mu continued her theatrical courtship: "Guan Yu! Take me as yours!" Her dewy-eyed plea even made Lin Lin mutter "seductress"—were Wen Qing not pinching his waist, Guan Yu might've succumbed.

The girl's charm proved overwhelming.

Shaking his head ruefully, Guan Yu declined: "I have lovers already."

"I don't mind!"

Wen Qing's escalating pinches left him wincing. Their playful trio captivated the hall—observers expecting Song's retribution now gaped at this romantic farce.

Chapter 1014: The Challenge

Beijing's socialites knew Mu as a notorious imp. Her earnest-seeming confession—to Guan Yu of all people—delivered ultimate humiliation to Song. Yet onlookers relished the impending clash.

True to predictions, Song approached with stormy demeanor.

"Showtime!" Li Bing nearly cackled. "Fool! Provoking Song's woman? Your death warrant's signed!"

Liu Wenwen admired Song's looks until Li Bing sneered: "Want him? Help me curry favor by sharing his bed."

As Song advanced, Lin Dong positioned himself protectively near Guan Yu's companions. Among Song's entourage, an unremarkable youth radiated danger—Lin Dong's instincts marked him as lethal.

"Guan Yu!" Song's greeting dripped venom.

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow. "Ah, the Young Master Song! How's your uncle? Still hospitalized?"

"Thanks to you." Song's eyes smoldered. The public beating of Song Dawei—however distant a relative—demanded reparation to maintain family prestige.

"This matter requires resolution," Song declared coldly—the Song clan's formal challenge.

Mu retreated neutrally as Guan Yu scoffed: "That pompous oaf? He earned his beating."

Gasps filled the hall. To insult the Song family so brazenly!

Even Mu frowned at Guan Yu's audacity. "Does your mother know you're this insolent?" Gu Jiayan snapped.

"Who's this rotund fellow?" Guan Yu retorted.

"Rotund?!" The weight-sensitive Gu spluttered. "I'll kill you!"

Mu's deadpan "Could your physique defeat him?" left Gu defeated.

"Destroying Hao Clan doesn't make you Beijing royalty," Song sneered. "Where's Jiang Ziqi? Too scared to support you?"

"Who summons me?" Jiang's arrival caused uproar. His appearance—with Xiao Dao—signaled Jiang family backing.

"Father requests your visit," Jiang told Guan Yu, tacitly declaring allegiance. Song's face darkened further.

Guan Yu nodded. "I'll cure you." Their pact solidified—enemies became allies.

Li Bing seized the moment to provoke: "Dare oppose Master Song, Jiang?"

"Your last beating proved insufficient?" Jiang retorted.

Hu Zongze's entrance brought fresh tension. "Friendship with Master Song honors me," the Hu heir declared, eyeing Guan Yu maliciously.

"Your antique-forging friend?" Guan Yu mocked.

Elder Wang threatened: "Respect your elders, boy!"

"My mother said spare no courtesy for dishonorable seniors," Guan Yu shot back.

As Wang lunged, the confrontation escalated—Beijing's power struggle reaching its climax.

Chapter 1015: Jiang Ziqi's Choice

The hall held its breath—this clash of factions would determine Guan Yu's standing. Jiang's allegiance shifted balances, yet Hu's intervention complicated matters.

Guan Yu stood unfazed, the storm around him testing alliances and resolve. Every player knew—tonight's outcome would rewrite Beijing's hierarchy.
