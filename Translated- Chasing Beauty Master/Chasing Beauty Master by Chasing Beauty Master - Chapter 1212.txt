However, no matter how much Xuan Ming poured water, the flames showed no sign of abating. In the end, the fire raged for an entire afternoon, leaving the kitchen stove utterly charred and the rice inside reduced to blackened cinders.

Xuan Ming was harshly reprimanded by his master, punished to copy the sect’s regulations a hundred times and confined to wall-facing meditation for a month. He could only resign himself to misfortune, baffled by the intensity of the blaze and blaming himself for his negligence.

Later, while cleaning up the aftermath, Xuan Ming suddenly discovered that the wooden stick he had used to support his leg lay completely unscathed amidst the ashes, without even a trace of burn marks.

Amidst the surrounding blackened ruins, the faintly glowing red stick stood out vividly. Overjoyed, Xuan Ming immediately recognized it as a rare treasure. As he picked it up, a profound sense of spiritual connection surged from the stick into his soul.

Xuan Ming knew this was the sign of a magical artifact recognizing its master. From that day onward, the entire Yunqing Mountain sect learned that Xuan Ming wielded a fire-scorched staff as his artifact—a weapon of extraordinary power.

Though Xuan Ming later attempted to refine the staff to purify it and alter its appearance, all his efforts proved futile. The stick remained stubbornly unchanged.

Over time, the sect came to respect the might of Xuan Ming’s artifact, and none dared mock him again. Now, as the sect master of Yunqing Mountain, Xuan Ming still wields that very same staff.

For someone like Xuan Ming—who spent his idle hours cultivating and studying artifacts—his collection of refined treasures had grown vast over the years. These artifacts were more precious to him than even his own family. Yet now, he was willing to let Guan Yu freely choose one from his hoard—an act of unprecedented generosity.

Junior Brother Lu was astounded. Never in centuries had the sect master offered such favorable terms to keep someone at Tiger’s Head Peak.

Though Junior Brother Lu himself possessed many artifacts—having recently gifted one to his son to aid his cultivation—he guarded his treasures jealously, rarely letting others so much as glimpse them.

Guan Yu tilted his head curiously. “Let me choose an artifact? That sounds amusing. But since I can’t use magic yet and know nothing about artifacts, wouldn’t it be simpler if Grandpa Xuan just gave me a good one outright?”

Xuan Ming nearly fainted from exasperation. Allowing Guan Yu to choose freely was already an immense concession, yet the boy had the audacity to demand a premium artifact directly—a request that stabbed at the sect master’s heart.

Seeing Guan Yu’s growing interest, Junior Brother Lu interjected urgently, “Guan Yu, you must understand—artifacts aren’t merely about quality. The best choice is one that harmonizes with your nature. Moreover, most of the sect master’s artifacts were seized in battle from others. Even if you obtained one, it might never accept you as its master. They’d be mere curiosities, useless in practice. I, however, have artifacts that could suit you. Take one or two as keepsakes if you wish.”

Xuan Ming’s face darkened. “Junior Brother Lu! Are you insulting my taste in artifacts?”

Bowing hastily, Junior Brother Lu clarified, “Sect Master, I meant only to spare your treasures. My own artifacts are plentiful enough to gift Guan Yu several.”

**Chapter 3112: The Fault Lies With You**

Xuan Ming’s eyebrows twitched in frustration. His plan to secure Guan Yu as a disciple through a single artifact had backfired spectacularly against Junior Brother Lu’s reckless generosity. Every artifact represented painstaking effort—none were lightly given away.

“Enough!” Xuan Ming declared. “Let us both present our artifacts. Guan Yu will choose whose to take, thereby deciding which master to follow. Agreed?”

Guan Yu stifled a laugh. Both men were vying so desperately to recruit him that they’d lay bare their treasured hoards. This promised to be entertaining.

Reluctantly, Junior Brother Lu nodded. Competing with the sect master was disadvantageous, but reaching this compromise was already a victory.

Xuan Ming added, “Guan Yu, since you find traveling to Tiger’s Head Peak cumbersome and have friends at Front Return Peak, I offer two options: stay here while I summon your friends, or return with Junior Brother Lu today. Tomorrow at this hour, I shall bring my artifacts to Front Return Peak.”

Junior Brother Lu gaped. The sect master—who hadn’t left Tiger’s Head Peak in a century—was willing to personally deliver artifacts? Unprecedented!

After consideration, Guan Yu chose Front Return Peak for its relaxed atmosphere and proximity to the outside world. “Grandpa Xuan, Front Return Peak is closer to phone signals. Communication would be troublesome here.”

Xuan Ming smiled graciously. “As you wish. No one will bar you from any of Yunqing Mountain’s six peaks.”

Junior Brother Lu brightened. “Exactly! Tiger’s Head Peak restricts sword-flight techniques. Since you prefer Front Return Peak, why not formally join my—?”

“Nonsense!” Xuan Ming cut in. “Residing there doesn’t preclude him from being my disciple. You’d merely act as his caretaker.”

Guan Yu observed their squabble with amusement. Neither would yield, but Lu’s offerings paled against Xuan Ming’s.

“Then I’ll await Grandpa Xuan at Front Return Peak,” Guan Yu decided. “I’ve time to spare there.”

Eager to inspect both men’s artifacts tomorrow, Guan Yu marveled at his sudden fortune—captured by Yunqing Mountain, yet now treated as an honored guest offered magical training and treasures.

Though unfamiliar with immortal cultivation, Guan Yu understood artifacts’ vital importance—second only to life itself. Junior Brother Lu’s own artifact amplified spellpower dramatically in battle. Losing it would force him to undergo the arduous process of refining another.

Artifact refinement demanded perfect conditions, rare materials, and high failure rates—especially for potent treasures. A compatible artifact was an immortal’s second life, cherished beyond measure. That both men risked their prized collections to recruit Guan Yu revealed their desperation.

Xuan Ming longed to teach Guan Yu sword-flight techniques immediately but knew Junior Brother Lu would protest—such instruction would formalize the master-disciple bond.

Traditionally, masters chose disciples during sect gatherings, assessing their potential. Xuan Ming had always abstained, hence his mere four direct pupils. Yet Guan Yu’s potential had ignited his resolve to claim the youth, propriety be damned.

“Remember,” Xuan Ming warned. “After Guan Yu returns, you mustn’t teach him any cultivation basics or spells. Guan Yu, learning from him would bind you as his disciple.”

**Chapter 3113: Dishonesty**

Though all six peak masters cultivated Yunqing Mountain’s foundational arts, their advanced techniques diverged based on individual aptitude. Disciples learned core methods exclusively from their masters. Studying another peak’s arts unauthorized warranted severe punishment—expulsion and crippling.

Junior Brother Lu chuckled. “I wouldn’t deceive you. Regardless of Guan Yu’s choice, I’ll only propose a sworn brotherhood with him.”

Xuan Ming reluctantly acquiesced.

During the return journey, Junior Brother Lu ceaselessly extolled Front Return Peak’s virtues and disparaged Xuan Ming—comments that would earn him a beating if repeated. Guan Yu remained silent until arrival.

“Grandpa Lu,” Guan Yu finally said, “wasn’t it agreed I’d decide tomorrow after seeing the artifacts? Your persuasion breaches our terms.”

Undeterred, Junior Brother Lu spent the trip extolling himself and slandering Xuan Ming—a performance Guan Yu imagined would make excellent theater if revealed.

Resigned, Junior Brother Lu resolved to organize his artifacts for tomorrow’s display.

Back in his room, Xiao Zhu accosted Guan Yu. “Brother-in-law! You vanished this morning—was Sister too bothersome last night?”

Before Guan Yu could reply, she added, “I’ll sleep with you tonight. Sister’s not to your taste, and she kicks in her sleep.”

Lin Qiaoqiao barged in, her sweet tone belying her glare at Xiao Zhu. “Darling, you’re back! Have you eaten?”

“With Grandpa Lu,” Guan Yu replied.

Xiao Zhu interjected, “That white-bearded old man’s scheming something! Be careful!”

“He means no harm,” Guan Yu assured. “Tomorrow I’ll become a sect disciple to learn magic. He’ll value me highly.”

The room erupted in shock. Lin Qiaoqiao paled. “You’re staying here forever?”

“Only to study. We can leave anytime after tomorrow,” Guan Yu clarified.

Lin Qiaoqiao sighed in relief. “You scared me! If I returned without you, how would I explain to Jingjing?”

Her slip reignited Auntie’s suspicions. “Jingjing? What are you hiding?”

Lin Qiaoqiao stammered denials, but Guan Yu intervened. “We’ve pretended to be engaged because her father pressured her. Jingjing is my actual girlfriend.”

Auntie’s family—exiled from their village—would be relocated to the city per Guan Yu’s promise, with jobs and schooling arranged.

Xiao Zhu gasped. “Brother-in-law! You have another woman? And Sister knows?”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes as Auntie scolded her. “Hush, child! This doesn’t concern you!”

**Chapter 3114: You’re the Problem**

Guan Yu explained, “Qiaoqiao and I fabricated our relationship to placate her father. You’ll all move to the city soon—truths can’t stay hidden there.”

Though Uncle seemed indifferent, Auntie absorbed this quietly. Xiao Zhu, ever blunt, quipped, “If I were you, I’d have hidden it better!”

Guan Yu could only sigh. The complexities of mortal and immortal entanglements were proving equally thorny.
