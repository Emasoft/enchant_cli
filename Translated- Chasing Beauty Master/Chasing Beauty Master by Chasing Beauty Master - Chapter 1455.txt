“So you’re saying Xiao Zhi came into contact with Yan Zhao’s blood? That’s how he contracted the Blood Toxin? If it’s that simple, wouldn’t countless others be infected too?”

“Not quite,” the Demon Lord explained. “The Blood Toxin spreads through blood. While the blood of an infected person can transmit the toxin, mere contact with unbroken skin won’t cause infection. It must enter through an open wound or be ingested. Only then does the corruption take hold.”

Wang Xiaorong added, “Brother Zuo Envoy once mentioned his suspicions about Yan Zhao. He likely fed Xiao Zhi something tainted with his own blood, deliberately infecting him. Then, he orchestrated Xiao Zhi’s beast transformation in front of everyone at Tiger’s Head Peak’s main hall—all to divert suspicion from himself. By framing Xiao Zhi after his own identity was exposed, Yan Zhao shifts blame onto you both. Now, neither you nor Xiao Zhi will get a chance to explain yourselves before facing punishment.”

Guan Yu slumped into a chair, numb with disbelief. Just days ago, Xiao Zhi had been perfectly healthy. To think he now suffered the Blood Toxin’s torment—a fate worse than death—and that even his father, Chief Zheng, might face consequences... The Yunqing Sect would show no mercy, regardless of status.

Seeing Guan Yu’s anguish, Wang Xiaorong approached and gently squeezed his shoulder. “Don’t despair. Though we can’t help Xiao Zhi now, as Chief Zheng’s son, Sect Master Xuanming might spare his life out of deference.”

Guan Yu shook his head bitterly. “You don’t understand Xuanming. He’s no benevolent leader. That man tolerates no flaws and shows no mercy. With Zuo Envoy’s influence, Xiao Zhi’s chances are bleak.”

“Guan Yu speaks truth,” the Demon Lord agreed. “Xuanming values usefulness above loyalty. When you serve his purposes, you’re indispensable. But the moment you become inconvenient—regardless of past merits—you’re discarded. That is his nature.”

“You must have the antidote!” Guan Yu surged to his feet, desperation cracking his voice. “Give it to me! I’ll save Xiao Zhi myself—now!”

The Demon Lord arched an eyebrow at this uncharacteristic outburst but nodded in grim understanding. For a man of Guan Yu’s passionate temperament, watching a dear friend’s impending execution would test anyone’s composure.

“Rong’er,” the Demon Lord sighed, “you explain it to him. He might heed your counsel. I have matters to attend.” With a swirl of robes, he departed, leaving behind the heavy weight of finality.

**Chapter 3791: Dismembering Him Wouldn’t Quell the Hatred**

Wang Xiaorong’s voice softened. “Guan Yu... there is no antidote. The Blood Toxin was created by Blackblood Ridge to control subordinates through fear. While our Soul Demon Sect learned to suppress its symptoms, even we never developed a cure. The toxin’s creator designed it without reversal—a permanent leash for obedience.”

Deep down, Guan Yu had known this truth. Asking had been a futile grasp at hope. Gritting his teeth, he spat, “Yan Zhao, you treacherous snake! I’ll carve you to pieces for this!”

“Listen,” Wang Xiaorong urged, “Yunqing’s hunting you now. After Yan Zhao’s lies, Xuanming believes you’ve betrayed the sect alongside Xiao Zhi. Consorting with demonic cults carries the ultimate penalty. Stay here in hiding until I gather more intelligence. Returning now would be suicide.”

Guan Yu clenched his fists. She was right—without exposing Yan Zhao’s guilt before the sect leaders, no amount of pleading would clear his name. “What else has happened at Yunqing?”

“After Xiao Zhi’s transformation, Chief Xiang took disciple Wenming to Tiger’s Head Peak. They’re claiming Xiao Zhi—as that black-furred monster—murdered A’Cai. Wenming’s testimony sealed the accusation.”

“Outrageous!” Guan Yu slammed his fist on the table. “Xiao Zhi had an ironclad alibi! Is Xuanming senile?!” He burned to throttle the sect master into rationality.

Yet he knew Chief Xiang’s motive—old vendettas resurfacing. During Guan Yu’s tenure, Chief Xiang had been his staunch opponent, while Xiao Zhi and Chief Zheng supported him. Now, with Xiao Zhi vulnerable, Chief Xiang seized the chance to muddy waters and compound punishments.

Xuanming played along not from ignorance, but political calculus. The unresolved A’Cai murder had bred unrest. Framing Xiao Zhi killed two birds with one stone—eliminating an inconvenience while appeasing the masses. Whether the condemned bore extra charges mattered little now.

Wang Xiaorong exhaled quietly, relieved the Demon Lord hadn’t lost patience earlier. Had their confrontation turned violent, neither man would’ve emerged unscathed. In all her years at Soul Demon Sect, none dared challenge the Demon Lord so brazenly—let alone an outsider like Guan Yu.

**Chapter 3792: Well-Intentioned Dissuasion**

“Let me take you to eat,” she offered. “This burden isn’t yours alone.”

“No! I can’t abandon Xiao Zhi to this farce! He’s my friend—I won’t stand by!”

“What can you possibly do?” Her voice sharpened with concern. “Chief Zheng himself can’t intervene. If the sect master’s own son lacks recourse, what power do you have? You’ll only share his fate!”

“I have to try! Knowing the truth and doing nothing—that’s betrayal! I’ll expose Yan Zhao before the entire sect!”

“You’re being naive!” she snapped. “Return now, and you’ll be gagged and imprisoned before uttering a word! Even if you spoke truths, none would listen. Yan Zhao’s reputation shields him, while yours hangs by a thread. Should Xuanming detect the Eight-Sided Drum technique within you, that alone condemns you. Where’s your leverage then?”

Guan Yu collapsed back, the fight draining from him. Her words struck true—Yan Zhao’s web of deceit had outmaneuvered them all. Any attempt to clear Xiao Zhi would entangle himself deeper. The Blood Toxin’s physical evidence was incontrovertible; explanations would only paint him as conspirator.

“Then what?!” Desperation tinged his whisper. “Watch him die branded a traitor?”

Wang Xiaorong ached for his pain—Xiao Zhi was his last anchor in this den of snakes. Before she could respond, Guan Yu’s eyes lit with sudden resolve.

“Yan Zhao serves your sect! Capture him! Let me execute that viper!”

She shook her head ruefully. “You ask me to defy hierarchy. Yan Zhao answers directly to Zuo Envoy. He’s a valuable pawn in Yunqing—my father won’t sacrifice him lightly.”

“Then tell me how to save Xiao Zhi!” His plea hung between them, raw and helpless.

Had Guan Yu slain Yan Zhao at the inn when he first suspected... Regrets gnawed at him. Xiao Zhi’s fatal error—trusting a mentor over a friend—now cost him everything. “Why believe him over me?” Guan Yu muttered bitterly. “Did our friendship mean nothing?”

**Chapter 3793: Provoking the Unforgivable**

Wang Xiaorong laid a gentle hand on his arm. “Xiao Zhi grew up idolizing Yan Zhao—a model cultivator, a hero. Years of admiration can’t be undone by days of your acquaintance. Were I him, I too might choose faith in a lifelong mentor over a new ally.”

“You’re right,” Guan Yu conceded hollowly. “I’m just an outsider.”

“Stay,” she implored. “Hide here until this storm passes. I swear no Soul Demon member will betray you. You’ll be safe.”

Reluctantly, Guan Yu nodded. For now, survival was his only path to justice.

Days later, Yunqing’s extensive networks found no trace of Guan Yu. In Tiger’s Head Peak’s main hall, Chiefs Lu and Dai pondered his disappearance.

“Where could he vanish?” Chief Lu mused. “Yan Zhao claimed he remained at Tiger’s Mouth Inn. Did he flee upon hearing of Xiao Zhi’s fate?”

Chief Dai frowned. “I dread him being cornered into extremism. We must warn Sect Master—lest demonic factions exploit this rift.”

Nodding, Chief Lu hurried toward the sect master’s quarters, only to learn he’d gone to Bamboo Peak—the disciplinary hall. Dread coiled in his gut. If Xuanming moved against Xiao Zhi now...

At Bamboo Peak, disciple Wang Jun greeted the panting chief. “Sect Master examines the prisoner. This way, Elder Lu.”

As they hastened through austere corridors, Wang Jun ventured, “You’ve come to aid Xiao Zhi, haven’t you? The charges are false—he’s clearly framed!”

“Careful, lad,” Chief Lu warned. “Speak such thoughts only to me. The sect master seeks to make an example—a purge of demonic influences may follow. All disciples will face spiritual screenings. Breathe not a word of this.”

Wang Jun paled but nodded. The revelation chilled him—he himself bore the Blood Toxin’s curse. Before detection, he must escape or perish.
