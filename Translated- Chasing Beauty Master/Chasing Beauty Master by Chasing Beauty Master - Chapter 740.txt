The commercial van ahead showed no signs of noticing the Da Hang vehicle following behind. After traveling some distance, it arrived at the Royal Garden Hotel.

Five men emerged—the same ones who had been watching Zhang Han in the supermarket. They entered the grand hotel together. Guang Yu immediately pulled out his phone and dialed Wei Hongwei’s number. “Wei-ge…”

Before he could utter another word, a woman’s sultry moans spilled from the receiver, punctuated by breathless gasps. Since Guang Yu’s phone volume was high, Zhang Han, seated in the passenger seat, overheard the noises. She tilted her head curiously. “Uncle, what’s that sound? The woman’s voice is… quite pleasant…”

Guang Yu’s head throbbed. *This is exasperating.* “Zhang Han, don’t ask questions now. Just tell me—did all five men enter the hotel?” He couldn’t answer her inquiry and swiftly changed the subject.

“Wei-ge, pause your ‘movie’ for a sec! Couldn’t you shut it off before answering?” Guang Yu chided, shooting a glance at Zhang Han. Wei Hongwei’s antics were hardly suitable for young ears.

Wei Hongwei sounded aggrieved. “Brother Guan, I was at a *critical moment*! I’d have hung up on anyone else, but not you. What’s up?”

“Check this: five men entered the Royal Garden Hotel at 8:09. Find their room numbers.”

“8:09? That’s right now!”

“Exactly. Track them.”

“On it! I’ll call back soon.”

As Guang Yu hung up, Zhang Han pointed ahead. “Uncle, the black van’s moving!” Guang Yu looked up—the vehicle was indeed rolling forward. *Someone’s still inside?*

He started the Da Hang and followed. If the driver had stayed hidden since the supermarket, tailing him might reveal their destination.

After traversing Royal Garden Boulevard, the van turned south toward downtown, merging into sluggish traffic. Guang Yu weaved through streets until they reached the southern suburbs. *Something’s wrong—they’re circling to shake us off.*

Wei Hongwei called again. “Brother Guan, no booking records for those five. Sure they checked in?”

“Then trace the black van, license AWU3687.”

After hanging up, Guang Yu’s suspicions crystallized: *They spotted us. This is a decoy.*

The van, now revealed as unregistered with fake plates, suddenly accelerated into an alley. When Guang Yu caught up, it sat abandoned, doors ajar.

Meanwhile, the five men had exited the hotel and slipped away in another vehicle.

*Such cunning tactics… What formidable organization operates in City A?*

After returning Zhang Han to the Yang residence—her arms laden with snacks guaranteeing compliance—Guang Yu briefed Yang Cheng.

“The Yangs have countless commercial rivals,” Yang Cheng mused. “Zhang Han’s been targeted multiple times. That’s why Father taught her our martial arts for self-defense.”

“She can handle herself,” Guang Yu said, “but these assailants are elites. If captured, she’d be overpowered. Do any families harbor such experts?”

Yang Cheng shook his head. “These aren’t private forces but hired killers. Even if caught, they won’t reveal employers.”

*So City A hosts a massive assassin syndicate… Their leader must be extraordinary.*

“This city teems with hidden dragons and crouching tigers,” Yang Cheng warned. “Zhang Han’s their obvious leverage against us. Though not a Yang by blood, Father and I cherish her as our own.”

With enemies lurking in shadows, Yang Cheng decided to personally escort Zhang Han henceforth. Guang Yu noted Yang Cheng’s impenetrable aura—testament to the Realm Sovereign’s Sacred Relic’s power. Though most of its energy had healed Yang Cheng’s body, residual potency combined with Patriarch Yang’s lifelong cultivation now placed him at the threshold of Peak Realm Sovereign.

When Guang Yu cautiously inquired about his cultivation level, Yang Cheng smiled. “Upper Realm Sovereign—one step from the peak. I owe you my life, Brother Guan. No secrets between us.”

*To think I saved a Realm Sovereign…* Guang Yu marveled, though puzzled how Yang Cheng’s advancement persisted despite the relic’s depleted energy.

Later, consulting confidants about the shadowy organization, suspicions fell on the Four Great Families—excluding Yangs, likely the Feng or Ran clans. Yet Guang Yu sensed deeper currents within the Yangs themselves, especially regarding Yang Conghan’s mysterious异能者 (supernatural) group and Zhang Han’s shifting identities.

The next morning, Guang Yu endured Xue Jing’s scolding for his reckless clashes. “Fighting the麦克大当家的 (Mac Clan’s leader)? You’d be dead if not for your recent breakthroughs!”

“They started it!” he grumbled.

“And your philandering!” Xue Jing retorted before relenting at Ah Mei’s pleading. The gentle girl had waited hours with a cooled dinner, her devotion softening even Xue Jing’s sternness.

As they breakfasted, Guang Yu outlined the previous night’s events. Xue Jing speculated the culprits were among the remaining Three Families, most likely the Fengs. Yet Yang Conghan’s covert operations and Zhang Han’s dual identity as “Qiao Na” deepened the enigma.

At school, Guang Yu enlisted Liu Shuowei’s help to infiltrate assassin networks, though the teacher’s nervous demurral hinted at concealed knowledge. Later, meeting Wei Hongwei at a secluded pavilion, Guang Yu appealed to their bond: “Wei-ge, we’ve bled together. Can I trust you completely?”

The web tightened—a labyrinth of cultivation realms, corporate vendettas, and a girl whose very name danced between truths...
