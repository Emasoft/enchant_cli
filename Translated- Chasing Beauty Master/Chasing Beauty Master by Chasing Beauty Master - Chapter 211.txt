Guan Yu arrived at the Student Council President's office. Though holding the title, he hadn't involved himself in student affairs until now, leaving everything to Wenqing, Wang Zhen and others to manage. The situation seemed better than he'd anticipated.

Soon, Wang Zhen and Tian Hao rushed in breathlessly. Without formalities, they plopped down on chairs.

"Was this your doing?" Guan Yu smiled.

Wang Zhen and Tian Hao exchanged glances before slapping their thighs in uproarious laughter. They laughed until tears streamed down their faces and stomachs cramped, finally subsiding with gasps.

Tian Hao, hot-tempered and cut from the same cloth as Niu Le, declared boisterously: "Liu Gang should've just stayed being the damn dean. Had to come swaggering before us brothers. If we didn't show him his place, he'd think he owned this school!"

"He's been harassing you?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Harassment's too strong. Just being a nuisance – tried to expel me and Wang Zhen. But when the principal stepped in, the old fart had to back down. Not satisfied, he decided to teach our class instead. My way? Beat some sense into him. But Wang here wanted subtlety – got inspiration from that Truant Heroes movie. Those teacher-tormenting tricks worked like magic!" Tian Hao started laughing again.

Guan Yu chuckled. "Why's he targeting you?"

"Like father, like son." Tian Hao shrugged. "Our Male Student Department maintains campus harmony. Liu Gang's son Liu Wei kept opposing us. After we disciplined him properly, his daddy took notice."

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. This confirmed Liu Gang's rotten character – needed to be reined in.

"Smell that stench? My special recipe – genuine virgin piss! Should've seen his shit-eating grin freeze. Priceless!" Tian Hao's laughter echoed.

"But the real masterpiece was your final kick, boss! A divine strike! I timed it – Liu Gang lay frozen for ten full minutes, water turning to ice on him. And how'd you lift him one-handed? That move made me drool!"

"Doing comes from willing." Guan Yu spread his hands lazily.

Tian Hao leaned forward eagerly. "Can this skill be taught?"

His shining eyes locked on Guan Yu like a lover's gaze, seemingly ready to pounce. Guan Yu shuddered in disgust.

"Inborn strength. Unlearnable."

Of course Tian Hao couldn't learn – Guan Yu's copper coin secret made the feat possible. Tian Hao's build matched Guan Yu's, yet he couldn't even lift Wang Zhen, let alone a burly man.

Throughout this exchange, Wang Zhen sat silently deep in thought. Guan Yu observed him before asking: "Wang Zhen, what's on your mind?"

Wang Zhen suddenly grasped Guan Yu's right hand with burning intensity, his gaze disturbingly tender. Guan Yu's skin crawled.

After prolonged staring, Wang Zhen implored: "Boss... leave us some living space."

Chapter 525: The Love Saint

Some men are born... wretched.

Guan Yu considered himself cheeky, but compared to Wang Zhen? A veritable saint!

Without his detection system, Guan Yu couldn't parse Wang Zhen's plea. "Living space"? Just because he'd been absent awhile? Was his face that offensive?

Conserving energy, he kept the system off.

"Wang, you idiot! Your Male Student Director position's secure. Think boss will remove you?" Tian Hao retorted bluntly.

Wang Zhen rolled eyes. "I won't waste breath on emotional illiterates." Turning to Guan Yu with reproachful eyes: "Boss, you've claimed Wenqing, Du Xiaojuan, even Zhao Jing'er! Fine – beast mode. But taking school goddess Gao Wei too? All the campus belles? Leave no hope for us single losers? Next flower that blooms – spare her!"

Guan Yu finally understood. Since when was he "ruining" anyone?

"Making me sound like some flower thief?" he laughed.

Wang Zhen shook head gravely. "No words describe your beastliness. Thieves grab anything – you exclusively target goddesses. Worse – legendary-level stunners. Those thieves aren't fit to shine your shoes!"

Guan Yu nearly repeated his classroom ejection move.

"Sounds like insults!" he huffed.

Wang Zhen instantly beamed: "How dare! You've achieved every otaku's dream – our idol! Just begging you to spare future beauties. Aren't your harem enough?" His wink oozed envy.

Guan Yu shuddered, yet curiosity stirred. "You truly think they're all mine?"

Only Wenqing was official. Du Xiaojuan waited pliantly. Zhao Jing'er? Impossible. Gao Wei... last night's memories surfaced – full breasts, alabaster neck, jade legs... blood surged.

"Your face betrays you," Wang Zhen deadpanned. Both thought the other wretched – Guan Yu's denials contradicted his smugness.

"Admit it," Wang Zhen pressed. "I've seen you boarding the same car multiple times. The driver? Prime beauty – not schoolgirl freshness but MILF charm. Recognized her – that 'forever eighteen' sis from Tian Hao's restaurant! Another conquest?"

"Suspected you five cohabited. Then Niu Le's drunken confirmation made you the Male Department's Love Saint!"

Wang Zhen's eyes shone fervently: "One man, four women! My eternal fantasy made real – yet I remain spectator."

Guan Yu paled. If Wang Zhen knew about Liu Shilei... or Li Xi? Wait – why think of her? Dangerous.

"Enough! Must you crush us?" Wang Zhen continued, oblivious. "Gao Wei? Our eternal goddess! You denied us hope, claiming her. That nestling-in-your-arms scene – pure envy fuel!"

"This morning I asked Zhao Jing'er – she said you stayed out all night with some star. All night for an event?" His gaze turned piercing.

Guan Yu froze. That naive girl! Must she blab? If Du Xiaojuan hadn't told Zhao Jing'er... Now the whole household knew. Homecoming meant stormy seas.

Impressed despite himself: Wang Zhen's detective skills wasted on campus. Should be a spy.

Silence confirmed Wang Zhen's fears. His last hope died. Grief transformed into action – hands on Guan Yu's shoulders, face inching closer for a kiss-like approach.

Guan Yu nearly punched him.

"Love Saint! Save me from singleton hell!" Wang Zhen begged.

"Boss! Let me follow you! Teach me your ways! East or west, I obey! Even my chrysanthemum's yours!" He vowed solemnly.

Guan Yu finally struck. "Who wants your ass? What do you take me for?!"

Tian Hao, barely containing laughter till now, exploded pointing at Wang Zhen: "With your face? Who'd want that chrysanthemum?!"

Chapter 526: The Goddess Arrives

Principal's Office

The principal sipped tea silently, occasionally glancing at Liu Gang shivering on the sofa. While sympathetic to the dean's plight after hearing his ordeal, duty prevailed – expelling Guan Yu wasn't an option.

He'd only met Guan Yu once, but the results spoke – reduced campus violence, fewer hooligans and troublemakers. The controlled "violence governance" worked. Maximum authority given yielded maximum results. Sacrificing Liu Gang became necessary – this beating would go unpunished.

"Principal!" Liu Gang finally erupted. "I demand justice!"

His voice dripped venom. Public humiliation by students – being tossed out like trash, face frostbitten into mottled bruises – required retribution. After identifying the perpetrator, he'd rushed here without changing frozen clothes, embellishing his victimhood to demand Guan Yu's expulsion.

The principal set down his cup. "Expulsion requires thorough investigation. Rest first, Dean Liu. We'll address this after—"

"Investigate what?" Liu Gang interrupted. "The entire class witnessed Guan Yu's assault! Faculty saw too! This delinquent attacks teachers – imagine what he does to students! Such cancer must be excised!"

The principal's face hardened. "I decide school matters. Dismissed." He resumed drinking, ignoring Liu Gang.

The abrupt dismissal stunned Liu Gang. Was his phrasing offensive? Or the principal avoiding trouble? Never considering the truth – Guan Yu's protection.

As newcomer, Liu Gang dared not confront the principal. Forcing a smile: "My apologies – spoke in anger."

The principal waved impatiently. Liu Gang exited, smile vanishing into vindictive snarl. "Guan Yu... you'll pay."

Since authority failed, he'd engineer an unignorable offense. Wait for the perfect moment...

Meanwhile...

Though punched, Wang Zhen wasn't hurt – Guan Yu held back. Tian Hao's hoped-for black eye disappointed.

Rubbing his stinging eye, Wang Zhen complained theatrically: "Boss, compensate my pain!"

Guan Yu regretted restraint. "How?"

"Feast us! You're treating lunch!" Wang Zhen grinned.

"Deal." Guan Yu waved generously.

"Invite Niu Le! Haven't seen that glutton forever," Tian Hao added.

"What else besides eating, drinking, and whoring?" Guan Yu snorted, reconsidering letting Niu Le roam free.

The duo's envious looks went unnoticed.

"You've managed well in my absence," Guan Yu suddenly praised.

Wang Zhen scratched head bashfully: "All thanks to your leadership."

Guan Yu had witnessed Wang Zhen's authority earlier – classmates' loyalty despite Liu Gang's threats proved his capability. His choice proved right – Wang Zhen was exceptional.

The trio chatted idly in the president's office, Wang Zhen updating campus affairs. With each report, Guan Yu's admiration grew.
