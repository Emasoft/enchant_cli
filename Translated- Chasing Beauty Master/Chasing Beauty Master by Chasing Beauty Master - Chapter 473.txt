“Hah, there’s actually a usable flesh body inside. So that’s what drew me here. Though its use is limited, it’s more than enough to deal with this hulking brute.” King Kong’s new form was that of a well-maintained middle-aged Daoist priest, exuding an immortal’s grace and transcendent aura. With the black staff in hand, he naturally radiated an awe-inspiring presence.

“King Kong, that man’s mouth reeks of filth. The brute is yours—I’ll take care of that bastard.” A flash of killing intent glinted in Guan Yu’s eyes. Ren Qiansha had crossed an unforgivable line by threatening to harm his woman.

“You think victory is assured? Hmph! By the Dark God’s Sacrifice, condense **, bind!” Ren Qiansha’s eyes flickered with momentary surprise, but his arrogance swiftly returned. “So what if you’re skilled? All mortal strength has its limits.”

A wisp of gray energy flashed, and the colossal Dark God’s severed right fist slowly regenerated from nothingness, its arm restored.

“Tch… A petty low-tier deity, not even its true form, dares strut about here? Leave this giant to me.” King Kong sneered, brandishing his Demon-Subduing Staff before vanishing from Guan Yu’s sight in a blur.

**Boom… Boom… Boom…**

King Kong weaved through the Dark God’s body like a storm, his staff piercing holes faster than the gray mist could repair them. Gradually, the regeneration faltered.

“Now!” King Kong’s eyes sharpened. With a shout, his staff expanded instantly, executing a simple yet devastating overhead strike—Mount Tai Crushing the Summit. The colossal black staff swept downward.

The Dark God froze, then shattered from the head downward, dissolving into threads of gray energy swiftly absorbed by King Kong’s staff.

“What now, Brother Ren?” Guan Yu strode leisurely toward Ren Qiansha, sword dragging behind him.

“What are you doing? You can’t kill me! I’m—”

“Whatever you are… you’ll die—”

Before the words fully left Ren Qiansha’s lips, his head soared into the air. Guan Yu smirked coldly, wiping his blade.

“Brother Guan, you’re too impulsive. That man’s background is no trifle.” Qing Tian sighed helplessly, too late to intervene.

“I’ve always lived by ‘no provocation, no retaliation.’ Since he crossed me, even the Jade Emperor’s son would die. Heh, consider this a repayment for saving me once. Next time we meet, we settle scores.” Guan Yu’s feelings toward Qing Tian remained complex, but he knew where to draw the line between enemy and ally.

**Chapter 1197: News from Kunlun**

“How do we leave now?” With the battle concluded, Guan Yu exhaled deeply. “The Dark God Cult’s methods are formidable—summoning a deity’s avatar. Thankfully this was in a sealed space. Had it been the mortal realm, countless would have perished.”

“With me here, fear not. This place isn’t for ordinary folk. This body can only fight at full power for five minutes. Hurry—retrieve the well-preserved flesh body in the valley. I’ll set up the array.” King Kong retrieved a crimson crystal from the Dark God’s remnants and began inscribing the formation, embedding spirit stones. Exiting this space was no simple feat, but nothing the little bald one couldn’t handle.

Five minutes later, Guan Yu, Liu Shilei, and Zhang Ziran stood atop the glowing array. In a flash, they vanished—just as a terrifying wave of black energy erupted behind them, obliterating the space as if it had never existed.

Emerging outside, Zhang Ziran wore a guilty expression. “Brother, I… I’m sorry for this…”

“Enough. It’s over. Let’s not dwell—especially with outsiders present.” Guan Yu smiled, tapping Zhang’s chest lightly with a fist.

“Guan Yu, I owe you a life debt. I’ll repay it when the time comes. Farewell.” Qing Tian departed briskly, his mind heavy with the realization of the demonic sects’ internal fractures and the Dark God Cult’s instability.

“Keep the debt. Just answer one question, and we’re even. Next meeting decides life or death.” Guan Yu waved him off. Qing Tian’s favor couldn’t match his own worth.

“Speak.”

“Ren Qiansha’s background. What repercussions will his death bring?”

“No secret. Two brothers: one a Golden Core peak disciple of Tianpeng Sect overseas, the other an early Nascent Soul disciple of Penglai Island. With your current strength, they’re no threat. But there may be other forces I’m unaware of.”

“Thanks. Now leave.” Guan Yu’s frown vanished. Let them come for vengeance.

After Qing Tian and Zhang Ziran departed, Guan Yu felt exhaustion and pain seep into his bones. The brief, perilous journey had taken its toll.

His phone rang abruptly.

“Hello?”

“Guan Yu? I’m Ye Qingling’s father. Come to Kunlun at once.”

**Click.**

Guan Yu redialed, but the number was dead. Dread clenched his heart. What could make Kunlun’s patriarch so fearful?

He rushed to Long Aotian at the Dragon Group headquarters.

“What happened in Kunlun? Is it about Qingling?” Guan Yu’s composure cracked—three years without news, and now this.

“You didn’t know? Then you missed this.” Long Aotian produced a wedding invitation.

“Ye Qingling… Hai Wubo? Who’s Hai Wubo?” The words exploded in Guan Yu’s mind.

“Hai Wubo is the Grand Elder of Inner Kunlun’s top disciple—late Nascent Soul stage, the strongest of your generation. A ‘match made in heaven.’” Long Aotian’s bland tone stabbed like daggers.

“So Inner Kunlun thinks to steal my woman? Late Nascent Soul? Let them try.” Guan Yu stormed out, racing to the airport.

On the plane, fury simmered beneath his calm. He needed a plan. He wouldn’t let Qingling suffer, nor abandon her to familial chains.

“Qingling, wait for me. I’ll bring you home.”

Disembarking, Guan Yu glared at the distant Kunlun peaks. Today, none would bar his path.

“Guan Yu? Knew you’d come. Follow me—you can’t ascend now.” A figure leaned against a Mercedes, smirking. Guan Yu froze. What game was this?

**Chapter 1198: Toppling Kunlun**

“Perhaps there’s no better way. If I must legitimize my claim, what speaks louder than strength? King Kong—unleash hell.” Guan Yu’s resolve crystallized.

The cultivation world mirrored the mortal realm: power commanded respect. Displaying might was the simplest solution.

“Train hard these three days. As a sect master, you can’t embarrass the Demon-Subduing Sect. King Kong laid your foundation. Now I’ll hone you.” Qin Wuliang appraised Guan Yu, masking disappointment at his still-lacking cultivation.

After three days in seclusion, Guan Yu emerged unchanged outwardly—but within, sword intent surged lethally.

Kunlun’s gates brimmed with festivity, myriad sects gathered in celebration.

“Such grandeur—last seen decades ago at the patriarch’s inauguration. The Grand Elder spares no expense,” whispered a disciple.

“Of course. Hai Wubo should’ve been patriarch, but lost to the current leader. Marrying his daughter secures the next succession. Though I heard the young mistress had a lover…”

“Pah! Some ‘genius of the age’—Guan Yu, that White Cloud Temple novice. Cultivating mere years? All hype. A toad lusting after swan meat.”

“Demon-Subduing Sect Master Guan Yu, accompanied by Elders Qin Wuliang and King Kong, pays homage to Kunlun!”

The gossiping gatekeepers gaped. The “toad” stood before them, smirking.

“Enough.” Guan Yu’s entourage—King Kong with his staff, Qin Wuliang with dragon-tiger scepter, and the servile Lao Xue—advanced.

“Impudence!” Dozens of soul pressures converged, manifesting a colossal violet seal crushing downward.

**Boom!**

“Is this Kunlun’s hospitality? Disgraceful.” Qin Wuliang stepped forth, summoning auspicious clouds to halt the seal. Guan Yu ascended calmly, unaffected.

“Annoying.” King Kong’s staff struck the seal, shattering it. The quartet pressed onward, leaving the gatekeepers trembling.

In the main hall, Kunlun’s elders paled, some bleeding from the backlash.

“Patriarch, is this Guan Yu your daughter’s…” Factions realigned, sensing the patriarch’s hidden ace.

“My daughter’s mischief troubles us all.” Patriarch Ye Xinwu stroked his beard, feigning composure while inwardly reeling. Demon-Subduing Sect? Since when was Guan Yu not White Cloud’s disciple?

“You dare call this ‘mischief’?” A cold voice interrupted. Grand Elder Xuan Feizi arrived, trailed by Hai Wubo in red bridal robes.

“Hail the Grand Elder!” The crowd bowed deeply, their deference unmistakable.

“Guests are welcome, but today is my disciple’s wedding. Return another time.” Xuan Feizi’s gaze chilled.

“Apologies, but I’m no outsider. Three years ago, Ye Qingling pledged herself to me. In this age of freedom, must we endure arranged marriages? I’ve come to claim my betrothed. Any objections?” Guan Yu’s grin was razor-sharp.

**Chapter 1199: What Will You Do?**

“Shameless! Qingling is my wife! Ravings of a madman!” Hai Wubo stepped forward, righteous indignation masking fury.

“Why waste words? Bring Qingling forth. Let her choose—simple enough.” Guan Yu’s tone brooked no argument.

“Sect Master Guan, Kunlun honors your status. Cease these absurd demands, or depart.” Xuan Feizi’s killing intent flared.

“Tch… When words fail, fists speak. Old man, taste my staff!” King Kong lunged, battle-hungry.
