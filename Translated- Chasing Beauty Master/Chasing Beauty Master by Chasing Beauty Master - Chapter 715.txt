It’s time for me to step in. After carefully observing the burly men, Guanyu knew dealing with them wouldn’t be difficult. The key was to act before they noticed him. If they realized his presence, they’d surely take the girl hostage, complicating things further.

“Stop.”

Just as Guanyu was about to strike, the two words froze him in place. The men turned, searching for the source of the voice. “Who’s there?” Guanyu, poised to attack, ducked back into the shadows of a roadside corner.

A young woman emerged from the poplar grove, clad in sleek black attire, her long ebony hair neatly tied. She seemed to blend into the darkness, save for her pale, striking face, vivid even in the night.

The men’s eyes glinted with lust as she approached. She was breathtakingly beautiful, her figure provocatively alluring. Yet Guanyu tensed—he sensed lethal intent radiating from her, a杀气 honed through life-and-death trials. A deadly beauty, perhaps?

The thugs, oblivious to the danger, leered. One drooled, “Boss, this one’s perfect! Look at her tender skin—so fair it’d bruise with a pinch. Damn, I’m drooling!” He stripped off his shirt and shorts. The bound girl on the ground turned her head away, gagging. “Ugh, disgusting!”

“Fine, Biaozi. The one in black’s yours first. I’ll take the delicate one here,” the leader said, undressing.

Guanyu almost pitied them. Lost in their fantasies, they had no idea what awaited them.

The captive girl, initially hopeful, despaired upon seeing another “helpless” woman arrive. She shut her eyes, praying for a quick death.

The黑衣少女 advanced. “Heh, this black-clad chick’s obedient—walking right to us!”

**Chapter 1816: Ouch**

The bound girl’s hope shattered as the黑衣少女 halted coldly. “Leave now, and you’ll live.”

“Hah! Scaring us, little miss? We love your icy act!”

Guanyu, hidden, wondered—why would such a skilled fighter be here? No residences for miles. Had she heard the girl’s cries?

The少女’s legs shifted slightly. A flick of her wrist sent a cold glint flying. The speaking thug clutched his throat, a blade buried in it. He collapsed, twitching.

The others froze. The half-naked leader panicked, “Who’s there? Show yourself!”

Terrified, the men fled into darkness. Guanyu noted the少女 let them escape.

Under the dim streetlight, her features became clear—a doll-faced萝莉 with porcelain skin, chillingly calm after killing.

“Come out. Men are all cowards,” she said suddenly.

Guanyu hesitated. Was she addressing him?

“You. Stop hiding.”

Surprised she’d detected him, Guanyu emerged cautiously. “Miss, I saw nothing. Whatever happened here—totally unrelated to you.”

The少女’s brow twitched. Recognizing his skill, she whipped off her belt—a coiled鞭子. It cracked through the air as she lashed out, wrapping his waist. Yanked forward, Guanyu spotted the dagger in her left hand.

Reacting, he feinted a grab at her chest. She jerked the鞭子, sending him back.

“Why attack?” he protested.

“Call me ‘beauty’ again and die.” She hurled the dagger. He caught it between his teeth.

Sniffing the blade, he grinned. “Such fragrance. Wasted on killing.”

Enraged, she whipped at his face. He caught the鞭子’s end, yanking her into his arms. “Even lovelier scent.”

“Pervert!” She struggled, kneeing his groin.

“Ack! My family jewels!” He doubled over.

The黑衣少女 broke free. “Next time, you die.” She vanished into the trees.

Rubbing his injury, Guanyu freed the captive girl—just as police arrived, guns drawn.

“Freeze! You’re under arrest!”

**Chapter 1817: Don’t Fear**

The黑衣少女 had fled the impending cops. Guanyu sighed—left holding the bag.

“I’m innocent! That corpse? Not my doing.”

“Hands up!”

The girl, Qiao Na, explained the黑衣少女’s role. Cops found another dagger lodged in a tree, clearing Guanyu.

As officers left, Qiao Na clung to him. “Big Brother, will your... down there heal?”

Guanyu smirked through pain. “Need a hand checking?”

She glanced at his crotch. “Should’ve crushed those eggs.”

He paled. Modern women and their ball-busting ways!

Later, Wei Hongwei called—they tracked Han Qiao to a “wellness center” that turned out women-only. Laughter echoed as they retreated.

**Chapter 1818: Desperate Rescue**

At Hongqiao Street’s entertainment complex, a hostess greeted them. Inside, all patrons were female.

“Damn intel!” Guanyu cursed.

Wei scratched his head. “But reports said Han Qiao was here...”

Guanyu paused—something felt off. The building backed into Pan Taisheng’s apartments... where Pan Xiaoxia lived.

“Let’s check deeper.”

But their search proved futile—no men in sight. Humiliated, they left.

“Wasted night,” Guanyu grumbled.

Returning home, Xue Jing waited anxiously—uncharacteristic for her. The night’s oddities piled up.

Han Qiao remained elusive. Yet Guanyu’s resolve held—this man’s loyalty and connections were worth cultivating.

The hunt continued.
