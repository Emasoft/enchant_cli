“Stop this nonsense. No matter what you say, I won’t let you out. Get back to your room this instant.” Jiang Yuan-kai feigned anger, knowing his daughter Jiang Xin would only obey through this pretense.

In the end, Jiang Xin found herself escorted back to her chambers. Before departing, Jiang Yuan-kai replaced the two maidservants guarding her door with armed soldiers—an ironclad declaration that she wouldn’t escape again.

The agony of missing Chu Fan’s performance gnawed at Jiang Xin like ten thousand ants crawling beneath her skin. Her earlier dash to the rear gate had been thwarted by those stone-faced guards, allowing her father to intercept her swiftly. Now, peering through her window, she saw soldiers stationed at every opening—Jiang Yuan-kai had transformed her quarters into an impregnable fortress. Escape seemed impossible.

Trapped and restless, Jiang Xin’s thoughts turned to Wan Hong (Vast Universe). This man who had gifted the East Sea Dragon Pearl and purchased the Rouge Opera House’s estate must possess remarkable cunning. Perhaps he held the key to her predicament.

**Chapter 4806: Summoning the Guest**

Jiang Xin declared loudly at the doorway: “Fetch me a maidservant. If I can’t leave, at least let me send a message!”

The guards exchanged glances. If the young mistress merely wished to cancel plans with Chu Fan, what harm could come of it? The burlier soldier soon returned with Jiang Xin’s personal attendant.

“Young Mistress, your command?”

“Go immediately to the Rouge Opera House. Find a man named Wan Hong and bid him come here. Hurry!”

The maidservant acknowledged the order and scurried away. Though rumors about Wan Hong swirled through the mansion—that he was Jiang Yuan-kai’s chosen son-in-law, the audacious soul who struck the Cao family’s heir with impunity—Jiang Xin remained blissfully unaware, confined as she was.

Meanwhile, unprecedented crowds thronged the Rouge Opera House. Standing-room tickets sold briskly alongside seated ones, all drawn by Wan Hong’s notoriety. Noble scions and curious onlookers alike speculated: Would this mysterious figure clash with Chu Fan during tonight’s performance? Even the heads of the Four Great Clans—melody-loving Patriarch Tang of the Tang family, and Qin Huan, the pleasure-seeking heir of the prestigious Qin family—secured seats, blending artistic appreciation with political curiosity.

As Wan Hong (secretly Guan Yu) prepared to depart, the theater’s deputy manager intercepted him: “Someone awaits at the rear gate.”

“Who?” Guan Yu mused. In this capital, beyond Jiang Yuan-kai, he knew few. Could it be Cao family troublemakers? He strode forth, ready for confrontation, only to find a trembling maidservant.

“Are you Lord Wan Hong?” she stammered.

“I am. What business brings you?”

“Young Mistress Jiang Xin requests your presence at the mansion.”

Baffled yet intrigued, Guan Yu changed into formal attire and followed her through winding paths to the Imperial Son-in-Law’s Mansion. Blooming gardens and cascading artificial springs testified to the Princess Consort’s refined tastes. At Jiang Xin’s courtyard, a peculiar sight greeted him—two mismatched soldiers flanked a door secured by a golden padlock.

“Can I enter?” Guan Yu asked dryly.

“No,” snapped a guard.

Jiang Xin’s voice filtered through the wood: “The lock is Father’s doing. Forgive the unconventional meeting, Lord Wan Hong. I require your aid.”

**Chapter 4807: The Mismatched Guards**

Guan Yu studied the odd sentinels—one towering, the other squat—as Jiang Xin continued: “Tonight’s performance will bring danger. Chu Fan may become a target to lure me out. Will you protect him?”

“You have my word,” Guan Yu vowed, sensing deeper motives.

“There’s more,” Jiang Xin pressed. “This confinement stems from your East Sea Dragon Pearl. Since you caused this prison, shouldn’t you devise my escape?”

Steel rasped as the guards drew sabers. Guan Yu raised empty hands, chuckling mirthlessly. Abducting the Imperial Son-in-Law’s daughter under armed guard? Preposterous.

**Chapter 4808: Unspoken Demands**

“Your predicament does weigh on me,” Guan Yu conceded. “But breaching these defenses would sever ties with your father. Surely wiser solutions exist.”

Jiang Xin’s tone sharpened: “Wise men create opportunities. You, who outmaneuvered the Cao clan, can’t devise a ruse?”

Guan Yu’s gaze drifted to the mismatched guards. A plan crystallized—not through force, but psychology. “Might I borrow ink and paper?”

When the materials arrived, he scrawled a message and handed it to the taller guard: “Deliver this to Jiang Yuan-kai. His daughter’s honor depends on it.”

As the man departed, Guan Yu addressed the remaining guard: “Your companion abets treason. Will you stand with traitors or loyalty?”

Panic flashed across the soldier’s face. In that moment, Guan Yu moved—a pressure point strike dropped the man silently. He produced lockpicks from his sleeve, but paused. True freedom couldn’t be stolen; it must be granted.

“Well?” Jiang Xin’s impatient voice came.

“Patience, Young Mistress. True power lies not in escaping cages...” Guan Yu smiled, sliding the unopened letter under her door, “...but in making others open them for you.”

The message bore two characters: 合作 (Cooperation).

When Jiang Yuan-kai arrived, he found his daughter calmly waiting and Guan Yu gone. The general stared at the cryptic note, then laughed—a deep, approving rumble. The game had just begun.
