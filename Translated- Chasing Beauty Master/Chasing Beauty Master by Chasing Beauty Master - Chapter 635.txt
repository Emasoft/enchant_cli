Watching the three men scrambling and stumbling into the vehicle while supporting each other, Dong Bin scratched his head and muttered, "Big Bro, you just said hitting people was crude behavior and that gentlemen use words, not fists..."

Guan Yu coughed lightly after glancing sideways at him. "I hadn't finished. What I meant to say next was: if you can solve things with fists, don’t waste time arguing..."

As the commotion settled, Guan Yu and his companion stood casually by the bus stop, while the nearby students gaped at them in astonishment. Even Xia Yao looked surprised. When the long-haired thug had lunged earlier, everyone assumed Guan Yu had fled in fear. No one expected him to return armed and strike so decisively.

"Th-thank you," Xia Yao finally stepped forward, her voice soft as she addressed Guan Yu.

"Oh? Don’t mention it. I didn’t beat them up just to help you. Mainly because they blocked the bus..."

"I know. Still, I owe you thanks. You did help me." Xia Yao smiled faintly, her delicate cheeks flushing crimson with shyness.

With the bus chased off by the thugs and traffic gridlocked near the school, taxis avoided the area entirely. Left with no choice, Guan Yu and Dong Bin began walking.

"Let’s go," Guan Yu sighed, beckoning his friend.

As they strolled, Dong Bin glanced back and whispered, "Hey, that girl’s following us!"

"Hmm." Guan Yu’s response was nonchalant. Earlier, students had mentioned buses only came every half-hour. They’d have to walk to the main road before hailing a cab.

"Slow down! Chat her up! Get acquainted!" Dong Bin waggled his eyebrows suggestively.

"Do you know her?" Guan Yu shot him an exasperated look.

Dong Bin grinned sheepishly. "What a missed opportunity! Such a beauty! You’ll be schoolmates—perfect chance to kindle romance! You’re hopeless!"

"You’re the expert," Guan Yu retorted sarcastically.

Reaching an intersection with lighter traffic, Guan Yu paused. "Head home or grab food first?"

Dong Bin smirked. "Two bachelors with nothing better to do? It’s still early evening. Let’s get drinks!"

Trailing behind, Xia Yao found herself oddly fixated on Guan Yu’s indifference. Accustomed to male attention, his disregard piqued her curiosity. When the pair entered a bar, she hesitated.

"Hmph! Trouble-making drunkards. How old is he anyway?" she muttered, though part of her lingered on thoughts of the enigmatic youth before shaking her head. "This is absurd. Blame that wretched long-haired hoodlum for stirring up nonsense!"

Two hours later, the duo staggered out into the night air.

"Ugh. Smoky hellholes. We’re avoiding these dives from now on," Guan Yu grumbled, though his flushed face betrayed his earlier enjoyment.

"Sure, Big Bro," Dong Bin chuckled, long accustomed to his friend’s contradictions.

As they wandered, Guan Yu suddenly halted. "Need to piss. Find a spot."

"Just use a wall!"

"Civilized people don’t do that!" Spotting a dimly lit park across the street, Guan Yu vaulted the fence with practiced ease.

Mid-stream by a tree, his cigarette’s glow revealed a shadowy figure curled nearby. Startled, he zipped up and approached—an disheveled middle-aged woman crouching in the foliage.

"Jeez! Auntie, what’re you doing here?"

"Hungry," she mumbled, leaves clinging to her hair.

After hurriedly finishing his business, Guan Yu turned to find her inches behind him. "Gods! Why’re you following me?"

"Hungry," she repeated, dogging his steps as he retreated.

Panicking, Guan Yu helped her over the fence where Dong Bin gaped. "Since when does taking a leak net you groupies?"

"Shut it! She’s lost. Let’s find a cop shop."

The woman produced a phone number. Relieved, Guan Yu called—a woman’s anxious voice answered instantly. Minutes later, a taxi screeched to a halt.

The elegant occupant—a stunning office lady in a fitted suit—rushed out. "Mom! You scared me half to death!"

As she thanked them, Guan Yu’s eyes widened. Xia Yao was striking, but this woman’s curves and poise eclipsed even her.

"Stunner. Absolute top-shelf," Dong Bin whispered reverently.

The woman, Sun Xiaoya, insisted on repaying them for the snacks. When her mother suddenly demanded, "Why won’t he come home? Are you denying him a child?" both men froze.

Sun Xiaoya’s porcelain complexion flushed scarlet. "Mom! Let’s discuss this at home!"

"Not until you apologize! Promise him a baby!"

"MA!"

Guan Yu wished the earth would swallow him whole as Dong Bing nearly choked trying not to laugh. After an excruciating exchange, Sun Xiaoya finally steered her mother away, leaving a twenty-yuan note for the snacks.

"Keep the change," she said tersely, nose wrinkling at their liquor-laden breath.

Next morning, Guan Yu awoke to pounding temples. Stumbling into the kitchen, he froze—the homeless woman from last night sat at their table, contentedly munching mantou buns.

Dong Bin shrugged. "She followed us home. Kept saying you’re her son-in-law."

Before Guan Yu could protest, the doorbell rang. Sun Xiaoya stood rigidly in the doorway, eyes bloodshot.

"Where’s my mother?"

As Guan Yu gestured weakly toward the kitchen, she pushed past him. "Mom! You can’t just—"

"Xiaoya! Look, your husband made breakfast! You two make up now, okay?"

Guan Yu’s mortification deepened as Sun Xiaoya whirled on him. "What nonsense have you been feeding her?!"

"Nothing! She just latched onto me last night!"

Their argument crescendoed until the older woman wailed, "Don’t fight! Have a baby and I’ll babysit!"

Three hours later at the police station, officers struggled to keep straight faces while documenting the farce. Sun Xiaoya’s icy glare could freeze magma.

"Mr. Guan," an officer finally said, "we’ll contact adult protective services. Meanwhile, perhaps you could..."

"Absolutely not! He’s coming home with us!" the mother insisted, clinging to Guan Yu’s arm.

Thus began Guan Yu’s unintended cohabitation with two women—one a corporate ice queen, the other a doting, delusional mother-in-law. Dong Bin’s prediction proved tragically accurate: "Trouble sticks to you like flies on honey."
