Subsequently, numerous challengers ascended the platform to showcase their skills, yet each was successively defeated by the squat figure nicknamed "Shorty Gourd." Within less than an hour, three opponents had already been swept off the arena by his signature sweeping strike.

Guanyu observed. No wonder Shorty Gourd was so formidable—despite his outwardly flawed appearance, the man was a Second-Class Zun expert. This explained his effortless victories.

With each triumph, Lin Qiaoqiao's expression darkened further. The sight of this repulsive old man filled her with visceral disgust.

Initially, Lin Qiaoqiao had felt only mild irritation upon seeing such a physically disadvantaged participant—a deaf-mute with leg deformities. She had even sympathized with his plight, assuming his life must have been fraught with hardship. Yet after his second victory, his demeanor shifted dramatically. The man tossed his head arrogantly in her direction and winked, nearly inducing her to vomit. This vulgar display instantly eradicated any pity she harbored. Truly, the wretched often harbor detestable qualities—such creatures deserved no compassion.

"A Second-Class Zun..." Guanyu mused. In these parts, such cultivators were rare. Elder Li commanded respect precisely because of this rank. For a remote town, the sudden appearance of another Second-Class Zun was extraordinary.

Reaching this cultivation tier guaranteed admiration and追捧 from the masses—these were genuine martial elites. Though the town boasted many martial families, most relied on physical techniques and brute strength like Guanyu himself, lacking true internal energy cultivation. Many lacked either fortunate opportunities or proper masters, forever barred from unlocking their qi channels despite lifelong training.

"Next challenger, step forth!" the elderly announcer boomed. Several washed-handed aspirants lingered belowstage, though many had already slunk away upon witnessing Shorty Gourd's prowess.

"Allow me." A clear voice rang out as a dashing youth somersaulted onto the platform. Fair-skinned and nobly attired in luxurious knit robes, his refined features and confident bearing marked him as a young master from an eminent family. His outfit blended modern leisurewear with ancient Huaxia aesthetics—wide lantern trousers paired with a flowing black trench coat that billowed impressively.

After identity verification, the youth selected a metal fan from the weapon rack. Though clearly forged from heavy iron, he twirled the implement effortlessly.

"Young Master Wang, defeat this toad!" The crowd erupted in recognition. Spectators preferred their local hero—even if they couldn't wed the Lin heiress themselves—over seeing their jewel wedded to the grotesque victor.

Lin Zhonggeng stood abruptly. Wang Chao, the Wang Clan's second young master, had arrived sooner than anticipated. This rare cultivation prodigy had reached Second-Class Zun years prior—an achievement most never attained in lifetimes. Though Lin Zhonggeng had no personal quarrel with Wang Chao, the thought of his precious daughter becoming someone's second wife—Wang Chao having already married last year—was intolerable.

"Father, rest assured," Lin Qiaoqiao whispered confidently. "Guanyu promised to help. He vowed I'll never wed another."

Lin Zhonggeng nodded, though dark thoughts lingered. If necessary, Guanyu might need to employ forbidden qi techniques. Wang Chao's cultivation reportedly rivaled Elder Li's—a terrifying prospect given his youth. Few in centuries had achieved Second-Class Zun before twenty.

Onstage, combat commenced. Shorty Gourd charged with spear whirling like blossoming death, while Wang Chao calmly snapped his iron fan shut, tracing defensive patterns in the air. Guanyu noted the faint qi barrier forming around Wang Chao's fan—the hallmark of Second-Class Zun combatants who could imbue weapons with internal energy. True qi projection required First-Class Zun mastery.

The clash erupted with deafening force as spear met fan. Guanyu marveled at the impact—unexpectedly violent for Second-Class Zun duelists. A towering spectator nearby muttered, "The youth's outmatched."

Guanyu studied this bystander—a hulking man over six feet three in black tracksuit and cloth shoes, casually gripping a broadsword. Attempting conversation, Guanyu received only a contemptuous glance. The cultivator world worshipped strength, and Guanyu's qi-less state invited disdain.

Biting back frustration, Guanyu refocused on the duel. Shorty Gourd pressed relentlessly, spear thrusts whistling through air as Wang Chao retreated toward the edge. The crowd's cheers turned to uneasy murmurs—their golden boy seemed destined for defeat.

Capitalizing on his advantage, Shorty Gourd executed a vicious low sweep targeting Wang Chao's legs. The young master parried desperately, but the overwhelming force blasted him offstage. Wang Chao bowed courteously before departing, dignity intact despite loss.

As Shorty Gourd celebrated his fourth consecutive victory, remaining challengers exchanged apprehensive glances. None dared face this monstrosity now. The victor turned to leer at Lin Qiaoqiao, eyes glinting with predatory hunger—a look that made onlookers' skin crawl.

The announcer proclaimed the streak uninterrupted. Shorty Gourd's grotesque smirk widened, imagining his prize. Lin Qiaoqiao trembled with revulsion, clinging to hope in Guanyu's promised intervention.
