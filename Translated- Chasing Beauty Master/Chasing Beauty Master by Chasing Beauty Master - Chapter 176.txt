Guan Yu’s heart raced with alarm. He quickly averted his gaze, maintaining an outward appearance of nonchalance while cold sweat trickled down his back. *This woman is terrifying,* he thought. *Absolutely terrifying. How does nothing escape her notice?*

Lin Lin, oblivious to having been subtly taken advantage of, finally recovered from her laughter. Clutching her stomach, she leaned one hand on Guan Yu’s shoulder and gasped, “Younger brother, you… you were brilliant! That was so satisfying! Clearly, this elder sister’s affection for you hasn’t been wasted.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes inwardly. *Affection?* He’d received no tangible rewards whatsoever—though he conveniently filtered out his earlier surreptitious glance at Lin Lin’s chest from his conscience.

“But I’m curious,” Lin Lin blinked her large eyes, “how did you know the diamond ring was fake?”

Clearing his throat, Guan Yu grinned. “A guess. Didn’t you tell me to crush that Wang Jie’s pride? Even if it were real, smashing it with a hammer would’ve humiliated him. A fake just made it sweeter. Lucky guess, really.”

The crowd nearly groaned in unison. So it was pure chance? Wang Jie’s misfortune stemmed from crossing paths with this… *unique* individual.

Yet two people disbelieved Guan Yu’s explanation: Lin Lin and Li Xi.

Lin Lin studied him deeply but pressed no further. Li Xi’s gaze held a different weight—this man, four or five years her junior, kept defying expectations, transforming impossibilities into realities.

With Wang Jie’s departure, the atmosphere soured. The event’s host had fled, rendering the remaining guests superfluous. Excuses flowed like wine as the crowd dispersed.

Within five minutes, only Guan Yu, Lin Lin, and Li Xi remained in the private room.

Lin Lin patted her thigh. “Peace at last. Frankly, I detest these pretentious reunions. Now—” Her eyes flickered between the pair. “Shall I leave you two to… *reconnect*, or shall we dine together?”

Guan Yu coughed awkwardly, glancing at Li Xi—here, he held no authority.

Li Xi met Lin Lin’s gaze, her expression unreadable. “Your opinion?”

“Oh, let’s eat! You’ve neglected me for ages. As for their *reconnecting*—” Lin Lin waved a hand. “Plenty of time for that at home. Besides, I’m dying to know more about this fascinating younger brother.”

Guan Yu decided silence was wisest. One misstep, and this woman would ensnare him.

“Let’s have someone clear this garbage.” Lin Lin gestured at the shattered “Ocean’s Heart.”

“Wait!” Guan Yu interjected. “The outer diamonds are genuine blue stones. Don’t waste them.”

**Chapter 434: A Waste of Talent**

Lin Lin stared, then burst into laughter, slinging an arm around Li Xi. “Xi’er, where did you find this adorable creature? I’m smitten!”

Even Li Xi’s composure cracked at her friend’s antics. “Ask him yourself. Shall I leave if you need privacy?”

Guan Yu gaped. Though he’d known Li Xi less than a day, he’d never imagined the ice queen capable of such remarks.

Lin Lin sighed theatrically. “I’d steal this弟弟 for myself, but alas—” She poked Guan Yu’s forehead. “So many lovers? Are any prettier than me?”

Heat flooded Guan Yu’s veins as he involuntarily eyed Lin Lin’s curves. *Not too late!* his mind shouted.

Li Xi observed coolly, “He seems eager. Feel free.”

Guan Yu deflated. *Nothing escapes her.*

Lin Lin chuckled. “Too old for tender shoots. He’s yours.”

*Tender shoots?* Guan Yu suppressed another eye-roll.

Changing tack, Lin Lin warned, “Wang Jie lost face and 80 million tonight. He’ll come for you in Beijing.”

Guan Yu shrugged. Enemies were nothing new.

As for the diamond shards, Guan Yu proposed, “Have them recut at Li Xi’s workshop. Employee bonuses?”

Lin Lin’s eyes lit up. “Brilliant! You’re wasted outside management. Join me—my staff includes many… *motivating* young ladies.”

Li Xi deadpanned, “His harem outshines yours.”

Lin Lin’s eyebrows climbed. “True?”

Guan Yu’s nod confirmed it.

“A风流弟弟!” Lin Lin laughed. “Well, to dinner!”

**Chapter 435: Reunion**

The dining area stunned even Guan Yu’s unrefined tastes—a miniature paradise of arched bridges, koi ponds, and winter-defying serenity.

Conversation inevitably centered on Guan Yu. He stuck to his “lucky guess” story about the diamond—truth would raise more questions.

Lin Lin’s teasing escalated until Guan Yu privately dubbed her “the female rogue.” *Why hasn’t she corrupted Li Xi?* he mused wistfully.

Three wine bottles later, Guan Yu’s cheeks flushed crimson. He’d deliberately avoided using his treatment system’s sobriety function—liquid courage might counter Lin Lin’s provocations.

A server’s whisper interrupted the merriment. Lin Lin rose with a sigh. “Trouble at the club. You two… *entertain yourselves*.”

“Let me help!” Guan Yu slurred, alcohol erasing inhibitions.

“Not this time.” Lin Lin’s smile tightened. “A… *influential* drunkard.”

The “influential” troublemaker proved to be Yang Yi—still reeking of vomit after his earlier humiliation by Guan Yu. Now he brutalized a patron who’d accidentally soiled him again.

Lin Lin’s diplomatic approach faltered as Yang Yi kicked a tending waitress. “Apologize!” she demanded.

“Apologize?” Yang Yi sneered. “This trash?”

“How about I kick *you* until you apologize?” a voice drawled from behind.
