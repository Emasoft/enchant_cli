“That damned brat must be doing this on purpose. When I get downstairs, I’ll skin him alive… Ouch…”

Wen Baoguo groaned as he pulled up his trousers in the bedroom, rubbing his nearly dislocated waist. Last night, after Guan Yu’s treatment, he had immediately mounted his wife Liu Yunshu with renewed vigor, riding her so fiercely that her body swayed wildly beneath him. She had matched his rhythm desperately, her cries growing louder and hoarser by the minute…

When an hour passed, Wen Baoguo swelled with pride. A full hour! Even many younger men couldn’t last this long. If his old colleagues knew he still possessed such stamina, they’d die of envy.

But soon, his smugness faded.

Another hour slipped by without respite. Liu Yunshu, astonished by her husband’s endurance, encouraged breathlessly, “Keep going, dear!”

Yet Wen Baoguo suffered in silence. Though the pleasure was intense, his aging body couldn’t endure two hours of relentless motion. His lower back screamed in protest, yet his arousal showed no signs of abating.

When a third hour passed, even Liu Yunshu grew concerned. “What’s gotten into you today? How are you… still going?” Her tone held more worry than praise.

Three hours! No mortal could sustain this—only a machine!

**Chapter 979: Winning Over the Father-in-Law**

Descending the stairs, Wen Baoguo’s aged limbs trembled weakly. Had he not been a soldier in his youth with robust physique, he might have collapsed outright.

“Dad, why’d you take so long?” Wen Qing greeted him sweetly, serving a bowl of rice.

“Are you alright, dear?” Liu Yunshu noticed his pallor, fearing he’d caught a chill overnight.

“Fine!” Wen Baoguo grunted, shooting Guan Yu a venomous glare. This brat’s fault—his entire body felt like jelly.

“So… Father-in-Law, slept well last night?” Guan Yu deliberately prodded, feigning innocence.

“What do you think?” Wen Baoguo seethed, convinced Guan Yu had sabotaged him. Why else had his body become an unstoppable piston, driven by an invisible motor despite exhaustion?

“I’d say you slept wonderfully. Pity about me, though… such a hard life.” Guan Yu struggled to keep a straight face. Served the old man right for interrupting his tryst with Wen Qing!

Wen Baoguo snorted. Though bone-weary, his resentment softened at seeing his wife’s radiant glow. For over a decade, unspoken dissatisfaction had lingered between them—sighs in the dark, strained silence. Only recently had their marriage regained its youthful spark, thanks to this meddlesome youth.

Mid-meal, the family patriarch Wen Shuquan announced abruptly: “The state allocated me a courtyard residence. I’ll move there soon.”

As a senior statesman, Wen Shuquan qualified for guarded estates but had long refused them as ostentatious. His son frowned. “Why now? You always said those resources should be returned.”

“Peace and quiet,” the old man retorted. Then, glaring at Wen Baoguo: “Work harder, boy! Give me another grandson while you’re still spry. Understood?”

Guan Yu nearly choked. A grandson? The man was in his fifties!

Wen Baoguo swallowed painfully. “Father… another son? At my age?”

“What? Can’t handle it?” The patriarch turned to Wen Qing. “You’d welcome a sibling, yes?”

“Absolutely!” She beamed. “I’ll have a little brother to tease!”

“No teasing!” Liu Yunshu chided, though her blush betrayed interest.

When all eyes fell on him, Wen Baoguo hesitated. “But… Yunshu’s forty-two. Isn’t she… too old?”

“Fool!” the patriarch barked. “Have you forgotten Guan Yu’s skills?”

“Him?” Wen Baoguo scoffed. “He’s no doctor!”

Wiping his mouth, Guan Yu interjected coolly: “Medically, pregnancy after thirty-five risks complications—but not impossibilities.”

“What dangers?” Liu Yunshu pressed.

“With me here?” Guan Yu smirked. “Older mothers need caution, not despair. Proper care suffices.”

“Settled!” The patriarch slammed the table. “Start trying. Preferably a boy, but a sister for Qing works too!”

**Chapter 980: Underhanded Tactics**

After breakfast, as Liu Yunshu prepared to visit her parents with Wen Qing, Guan Yu eagerly joined. But Wen Baoguo stopped him.

“Father-in-Law?”

“Drop the title!” Wen Baoguo glowered, still sore from last night’s ordeal. “You’ll earn it when you wed Qing!”

Though begrudgingly, he’d accepted Guan Yu after the patriarch named him family heir. The youth had wealth, drive, medical prowess—and his daughter’s heart.

Smirking inwardly at this tacit approval, Guan Yu pressed: “What troubles you?”

“Must you use needles for… potency? Any pills?” The minister’s ears burned with shame.

Guan Yu feigned ignorance. “Potency for what?”

“Brat!” Wen Baoguo nearly lunged.

Chuckling, Guan Yu advised: “Pills damage health. Stick to acupuncture. As for Mother-in-Law, I’ll prescribe tonics. Oh—avoid anger. Might… hinder conception.”

The veiled threat wasn’t lost on Wen Baoguo. “You dare threaten me?” He swatted Guan Yu’s head playfully.

“Dad! Why hit him?!” Wen Qing stormed in, followed by Liu Yunshu’s scolding.

“It’s nothing,” Guan Yu sighed theatrically. “I’ll endure any punishment… so long as we’re not parted.”

Wen Baoguo’s eye twitched at the shameless act. Even his wife sided against him: “Control your temper! What if you injured him?”

As the women fussed over Guan Yu, the youth shot his foe a triumphant glance. Outnumbered, Wen Baoguo grumbled: “Whole household gangs up on me after days! No justice…”

**Chapter 981: Discipline**

Later, in his car, Wen Baoguo ordered his driver: “Warn the Li family—keep Li Yu from retaliating against Guan Yu.”

“Understood.”

Sighing, the minister muttered: “That’s all I can do, brat. Surviving Beijing’s politics requires your own strength.”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu called Li Xi: “Can we delay Taiwan? There’s a ball tomorrow…”

“Go alone then!” She hung up, angered.

Lín Lin teased the distraught Li Xi: “Heartbroken?”

“Nonsense.”

“Deny it all you want,” her friend sighed. “But love needs fighting for. Regret lasts forever.”

Elsewhere, Guan Yu arranged bodyguards for Li Xi before cold-calling Wan Qianshan in Taiwan. Time to rein in his arrogant subordinate.
