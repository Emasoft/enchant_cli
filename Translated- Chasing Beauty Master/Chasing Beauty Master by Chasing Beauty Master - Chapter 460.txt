“Brother Guan, hmm? Be careful.” Just as Zhang Ziran and Fa Neng breathed sighs of relief, and Guan Yu had already stored away his Demon-Subduing Staff, a figure suddenly flashed by. A cyan streak of light shot toward Guan Yu, while Yan Qing’s slightly twisted face flickered momentarily in the air.

“Die…” Yan Qing sneered. He had been lurking nearby, initially intending to slip away after witnessing Guan Yu’s overwhelming display of power. But when he noticed Guan Yu’s sudden pallor—as if his body had been drained—he resolved to strike.

**Chapter 1163: The Final Trial**

“Guan Yu, watch out!” A white figure suddenly appeared behind Guan Yu, soaring upward. A crystalline white barrier materialized before him, deflecting the cyan sword.

“Heh, I’ve been waiting for you, Miss Yun. Thank you…” Guan Yu smirked mockingly at Yan Qing. With a flash of violet light at his feet, he vanished and reappeared behind Yan Qing. The magical sword known as Thundercloud gleamed in his hand.

“Seven Stars Align…”

Swordlight flickered like the shimmering of the Big Dipper.

“Clang! Clang! Clang…”

Six metallic clashes rang out, followed by the sickening sound of steel piercing flesh.

“Hiss…”

“Guan Yu, I refuse to believe luck will favor you every time!” Yan Qing retreated swiftly, rescuing Yin Ye. Everyone could clearly see the long gash running from his temple to the corner of his mouth—a bloody testament to Guan Yu’s strike.

“If there’s a next time, I’ll kill you openly and honorably.” Guan Yu nodded at Yun Xuanwu. Even without her intervention, he would have survived, albeit injured. Her timely aid spared him harm, filling him with gratitude.

**———**

“Brother Zhang, let me in.” After swallowing two vitality-restoring pills, Guan Yu approached the formation barrier.

“I can’t activate this formation. We must wait for Brother Zhang to awaken.” Zhang Ziran finally relaxed. Though Guan Yu’s hands trembled slightly, he knew that even if Guan Yu collapsed now, no one would dare challenge him again. Who could tell if this weakness was another ruse?

“Demonic Sect members are selfish. None would entrust their lives to others. They’re likely already seeking an escape. Brother Guan, you’ve reaped quite a harvest today.” Yun Xuanwu stared at Guan Yu as if he were a ghost. The recent battle had left an indelible mark—Guan Yu had single-handedly defeated the finest young talents of both righteous and demonic paths. Terrifying enough at the early Golden Core stage, what heights might he reach with further cultivation?

Guan Yu smiled faintly, offering no reply. Having gained such advantages, it was unwise to gloat.

**———**

Half an hour later, Zhang Xiaojun awoke and opened the formation for Guan Yu.

“Brother Zhang, how do you feel?” Guan Yu had little medical skill, but Zhang Xiaojun—as the reincarnation of Lü Zu—surpassed him by leagues in alchemy and healing.

“I’ll recover. My earlier collapse stemmed from damaged foundational essence. With half a year of rest, I’ll fully heal. But Miss Zuo… she’s in grave danger.” Zhang Xiaojun naturally assumed the role of physician, distributing tailored pills to the injured. Aside from Yun Xuanwu, all bore significant wounds, with Zuo Qingyi’s condition the most dire.

“Explain.” Guan Yu’s expression remained neutral. Zuo Qingyi appeared nearly lifeless, her body ravaged by the purple Demon Emperor’s Technique of Soaring Heaven, the Yin Kui Demonic Art of Lü Wu, and the Kunlun Sect’s techniques from Yin Ye. Surviving assaults from three late Golden Core experts was nothing short of miraculous.

“Her heart meridian is severed—a certain death sentence. Yet a wisp of energy clings to her heart, preserving her in suspended animation. Without a Nine Revolutions Reincarnation Pill within three days, this stasis will solidify into true death. Qingcheng likely prepared this failsafe, but even if we escape, they may not reach her in time.” Zhang Xiaojun’s grave tone underscored the urgency.

“Jin Gang, any alternatives?” Guan Yu’s face tightened. Three days—he might not even finish refining the inheritance stele.

“Heh, Master, if you succeed in refining the stele, all problems vanish. If not, this girl dies.” Jin Gang chuckled weakly, too drained to elaborate.

“Miss Yun, please fetch Qingling from this location. I’ll begin refining the inheritance stele—our only exit. Brother Zhang, tend to Zuo Qingyi.” Guan Yu chose his words carefully, unwilling to reveal Jin Gang’s existence or the full extent of his gains.

“Understood.”

“Leave it to me. We can only do our utmost and leave the rest to fate.” Zhang Xiaojun nodded, retrieving an acupuncture kit.

**———**

Guan Yu approached the towering stele—99 zhang tall, 66 zhang wide—its surface devoid of inscriptions yet exuding ancient solemnity. Flecks of golden light shimmered mysteriously.

“Place your hand on the stele and repeat after me…”

Jin Gang’s voice resonated with a primal rhythm. The archaic incantations rolled from Guan Yu’s lips, carrying divine weight. A golden flash later, Guan Yu vanished.

**———**

“Guan Yu grows more enigmatic by the day. Would someone recount what transpired during my unconsciousness?” Zhang Xiaojun gaped at the empty space, noting how Zhang Ziran and Fa Neng seemed unsurprised. He’d clearly missed pivotal events.

**Chapter 1164: The Ascension Stairway**

Disoriented, Guan Yu found himself before a colossal mountain gate—the true core of the inheritance site.

“This is the Demon-Subduing Sect’s essence,” Jin Gang materialized, his form slightly faded yet radiating pride. “Your final trial: the Mountain Protection Array. First, ascend the Ascension Stairway.”

Guan Yu eyed the endless staircase, its aura tinged with danger. “This tests disciples’ resolve. 999 steps—trials of heart, nature, and tribulation. Reach the summit to claim provisional mastery. Subsequent trials unlock greater authority until you fully inherit the sect.”

“Let’s begin.” Guan Yu stepped forward, undaunted by mental challenges.

**———**

The first step plunged him into illusion: naked, with Ye Qingling and Yun Xuanwu approaching seductively.

“Brother Guan Yu… don’t you desire me?” The young girl’s plea tugged at mortal weakness.

“Lust without love is emptiness. Illusions cannot sway me.” Guan Yu smirked, ascending the second step as the vision dissolved.

Step by step, he faced trials of greed, wrath, and worldly temptations. Each choice honed his Dao heart, fortifying his resolve. By the 900th step, the stairway’s energies had mended his透支 body, solidifying his foundation.

“Beware the final 99 steps,” Jin Gang warned.

**———**

A masked figure materialized. “Guan Yu… return my life…”

Countless vengeful spirits—victims of Guan Yu’s past—swarmed him, howling for retribution.

“I act without remorse. Challenge me again, and I’ll slaughter you anew!” Guan Yu slashed his sword, cleaving the nightmare.

**———**

At the summit, Guan Yu gazed upon swirling mists and七彩 radiance. “Jin Gang, how do we heal Zuo Qingyi?”

“Refine the stele. Freedom awaits.” Jin Gang’s voice strengthened as Guan Yu’s spiritual sense swept the sect’s expanse—vast as a province.

“The Demon-Subduing Sect’s glory dwarfed even蜀山. A mere Golden Core like you can’t fathom it,” Jin Gang boasted.

“How do I claim this inheritance?”

“You’ve only passed the first trial. As an outer disciple, you may select pills, foundational techniques, and limited training time. Grow stronger to unlock more.”

“Choose a pill for Zuo Qingyi. Now—how do we leave?”

“Absorb the stele. The realm will collapse. An eastern portal awaits.”

**———**

Returning outside, Guan Yu addressed the group: “Prepare to depart.”

**Chapter 1165: The Inheritance of the Demon-Subduing Sect**

As Guan Yu’s party regrouped, Zhang Xiaojun tended to Zuo Qingyi, his concern betraying deeper feelings.

Guan Yu closed his eyes, the weight of inheritance settling upon him—a beacon in the gathering storm of cultivation’s endless strife.
