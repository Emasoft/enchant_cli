Nimble as a swallow, Guan Yu leaped far back to evade the giant ape's incoming assault. Drawing his Soulfall Blade mid-air, he unleashed a powerful Battle Qi Slash.

Though massive in size, the ape moved with startling agility. Swiveling its torso, it raised an arm to block the energy wave, dispersing Guan Yu's attack effortlessly.

The dismissal of his strike irked Guan Yu. Stabilizing his stance, he channeled spiritual energy to conjure a protective shield—less robust than his former "eggshell" defense but sufficient to mitigate damage. With blade in hand, he unleashed a relentless barrage of Battle Qi Slashes, each strike erupting like machine-gun fire.

The onslaught forced the ape into a defensive frenzy. Though individual slashes caused minimal harm, their cumulative impact disoriented the beast. Seizing the moment, Guan Yu gripped his blade with both hands, vaulted skyward, and plunged downward in a decisive overhead strike aimed at the ape's skull.

**Chapter 4638: Utterly Conquered**

Guan Yu's speed surpassed the ape's reflexes. Exploiting his dual mastery of martial and mystical arts, he pressed the attack. A colossal phantom of the Soulfall Blade materialized mid-descent, its lethal arc threatening to cleave the beast's head.

Anticipating catastrophe, the ape twisted its bulk, shielding its skull with brawny arms while thrusting its chest upward—a last-ditch effort to absorb the blow with its toughest hide.

*Crash!*

The strike hammered into the ape's torso, slamming it earthward in a thunderous impact. Dust billowed as Guan Yu stood coldly observant. "You brought this upon yourself," he remarked, blade gleaming. "Ambushing me was folly. Blocking my path? Worse. I've no time for drawn-out battles."

When the ape staggered upright, a deep gash marred its iron-hard pectorals—testament to Guan Yu's fearsome strength. The young warrior stood ready, Soulfall Blade glowing ominously in his left hand while his right clutched a Desert Eagle pistol. Spell and bullet alike awaited the slightest provocation.

Guan Yu noted the ape's unnatural resilience—even firearms might struggle against such hide. Yet precision shots to vulnerable areas like eyes could end this.

The ape hesitated, recognizing its opponent's rare dual cultivation. Admitting defeat, it roared and conjured a translucent shield from below—a futile defense against Guan Yu's adaptability. With contemptuous ease, the warrior shattered the barrier through sheer blade work, exploiting weaknesses in the ape's guard.

Targeting tender joints and pressure points, Guan Yu's qi-inflicted strikes soon overwhelmed the beast. A final flying kick sent it crashing down, blood streaming from nostrils and a mangled limb.

"Listen well," Guan Yu addressed the wheezing creature. "I seek no quarrel, only the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Feign ignorance at your peril."

Suddenly, the ape's form shimmered, reshaping into an elderly man. Guan Yu gaped. "Elder Miao?!"

**Chapter 4639: Unexpected Revelation**

The transformed ape—now revealed as Miao Zhang, leader of Yaoren City—coughed weakly. "Impressive... A dual cultivator. My defeat is deserved, though your inexperience shows."

Guan Yu tensed, wary of provoking the elder's formidable forces. "Why guard this place?"

"Long ago," Miao Zhang began, binding his wounded arm, "a peerless warrior entrusted my lineage with protecting the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. None have breached this sanctum... until you." Sealing the cavern entrance with a glowing sigil, he added, "This barrier delays others seeking the treasure."

As distant rumblings signaled approaching pursuers, Miao Zhang led Guan Yu to a hidden wall. "The trial is yours alone," he said, offering a beast-hide scroll. Chanting the inscribed incantation, Guan Yu triggered ancient mechanisms—stone grinding as a passageway yawned open.

**Chapter 4640: The Chamber**

Candle-lined walls illuminated Guan Yu's path to an anachronistic chamber—pristine yet archaic. A canopied plank bed, wooden washbasin, and unfamiliar artifacts suggested meticulous preservation. Though wary of traps, Guan Yu pressed inward, discovering a final ornate door.

Beyond lay a modest room frozen in time—gleaming relics arranged with military precision. A lacquered chest dominated the space, its contents humming with latent power. Guan Yu's fingers brushed the lid...
