Director Nie stood gloating on the sidelines, watching Director Li with malicious amusement. Damn it! I've long been sick of this bastard's face! Wouldn't it be better for you to stay put in your office instead of coming down here playing the big shot? Serves you right!

"I..." Director Li clutched the disconnected phone, his mouth opening and closing like a stranded fish.

Meanwhile, in the moving vehicle, Guan Yu listened as Fang Zhe, the driver, made repeated calls to disciplinary inspection authorities, demanding thorough investigation of Director Li.

Shock... This was Guan Yu's first time feeling such profound astonishment. In his eyes, Director Nie had already been an untouchable municipal authority figure. Yet this Director Li held even higher rank, evident from Director Nie's cautious deference.

Yet such a high-ranking provincial official could be subjected to full disciplinary investigation simply because of this old man's casual remark? Power... What a marvelous thing indeed!

During the journey to the capital, Guan Yu first called Du Xiaojuan. After lengthy gentle reassurances and explanations, she reluctantly hung up. The image of her alone in that vast villa worried him. That timid girl must be curled up like a frightened rabbit after tonight's turmoil.

His heart ached at the thought.

Next, he briefly informed Godfather Liu of his safe release and impending capital trip, avoiding details due to the old man's presence. "That rascal's got some tricks!" Liu chuckled in surprise, having prepared to mobilize old connections for rescue. The Jin family's influence was extraordinary - only capital-level intervention could achieve this.

Finally, he asked Feng Xin to accompany Du Xiaojuan. The silent old man beside him remained an enigma. Regardless, fulfilling this treatment request would settle their debt. Survival required accelerated growth - money, power, influence. Closing his eyes, Guan Yu planned: legitimate businesses for status, Luo Cheng or Niu Le handling underground expansion. True freedom required both light and shadow.

For ordinary people, this might be fantasy. But with his supernatural abilities, Guan Yu deemed it achievable.

Chapter 268: Exploration Skill Upgrade

Entering the military hospital, Guan Yu followed the old man to fourth-floor wards. Expecting critical soldier or elder, he froze at seeing the patient - a pale, fragile girl of sixteen, connected to myriad machines.

Her delicate features evoked pity - a modern Lin Daiyu. "Grandpa..." Her whisper drained remaining color from already bloodless lips. The composed old man transformed into a flustered guardian, shoving aside medical staff. "Guan Yu, examine her!"

Activating Exploration Skill, Guan Yu staggered as the bronze coin violently vibrated - all four abilities unexpectedly upgraded simultaneously. Gravity Control, Healing, Exploration, and even rarely-used Pet System? Before pondering this, diagnostic data flooded his mind.

Chapter 269: Unspeakable Affliction

"Cardiac output at 44 bpm, six obstructions, four congenital aneurysms..." Guan Yu's precise diagnosis stunned everyone. Advanced equipment required weeks to gather this data. "...Severe dysmenorrhea with complete menstrual obstruction."

The girl buried her blushing face in sheets. Medical staff gaped. The old man paled - his eighteen-year-old granddaughter never had menstruation? Guan Yu's scan revealed thicker hymen completely blocking passage, menstrual blood accumulating internally for years.

Her survival through constant pain awed Guan Yu. What iron will sustained this delicate creature?

Chapter 270: I Will Save Her

"Treat her! I'll give anything!" The old man pleaded desperately. This abandoned infant found during mountain patrol six decades ago had become his sole family. Now hope glimmered through Guan Yu's miraculous vision - he saw not just illness, but the incredible survivor beneath.
