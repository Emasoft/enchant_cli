“Understood.” Manor Lord Lu replied weakly, still seething with suppressed anger. “Send men to escort the three young heroes away first. This place may soon become perilous. There’s no need for them to be implicated here.”

“What kind of talk is this, Manor Lord Lu?” Yan Zhao declared. “We three came precisely to lend our strength to Tiger’s Maw Manor. How could we possibly abandon our post now?”

Lord Lu rose to his feet. “Very well. Let me first express my gratitude to you three young heroes. Now that defense is our paramount concern, we must strategize.”

He then began issuing commands: “Guards! Activate the protective barrier and bring me the terrain maps.”

Before the Soul Demon Sect forces could reach Tiger’s Maw Manor’s defenses, observers from afar witnessed a pale golden protective membrane gradually expanding over the manor’s battlements, encasing the entire compound within its shimmering dome.

**Chapter 3766: Sabotage**

“Such a powerful barrier couldn’t have been conjured by a single individual,” remarked the Right Envoy as she observed from the enemy camp. “It seems Tiger’s Maw Manor harbors array masters. Only pre-established formation arrays could manifest such grand magic.”

Wang Xiaorong asked, “Can our forces still penetrate it?”

“No need for concern. Our troops at their gates are merely a diversion,” the Right Envoy sneered, her eyes glinting coldly. “The true assault will come from my Blazing Phoenix. While our vanguard keeps them occupied, I’ll unleash the phoenix here. Tiger’s Maw Manor won’t escape the conflagration.”

At her command, a large clearing in the Soul Demon Sect’s encampment revealed a massive square cauldron blazing with furious flames. Forty practitioners stood in precise formation around it, their positions dictated by complex geomantic calculations.

The Right Envoy stood at the center, wielding her infamous Soul-Devouring Whip - a notorious artifact rumored to be a flawed creation of an immortal. Even as an imperfect relic, it remained a peerless treasure among mortal cultivators.

Channeling the whip’s spiritual energy, the Right Envoy directed streams of crimson light to coalesce above the cauldron. Her forty subordinates joined their power to the formation, their combined energies blazing with such intensity that even the cauldron’s flames paled in comparison. As she chanted ancient incantations, the swirling energies began taking shape - a colossal fire phoenix whose mere passage would reduce all in its wake to ashes.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi infiltrated the Soul Demon Sect’s perimeter. Having anticipated unorthodox tactics from the enemy, the duo had volunteered to reconnoiter the camp after consulting with Tiger’s Maw’s defenders.

Peering from behind a tent, Xiao Zhi whispered, “Guan Yu, look! What ritual are they performing?”

“Preparing a grand spell against the manor, no doubt,” Guan Yu observed grimly. “We must disrupt this.”

Disguising themselves in stolen cultist robes, they approached the ritual ground. Above the cauldron, crimson flames now writhed in the unmistakable silhouette of a phoenix spanning over thirty feet.

“We must break their formation,” Guan Yu urged. “Distract them while I destroy the central cauldron. That’s the array’s nexus.”

As Xiao Zhi created a diversion, drawing away numerous cultists, Guan Yu seized his moment. The Right Envoy, alerted to the intrusion, personally led the pursuit of the disturbance.

Left momentarily unguarded, the ritual site became vulnerable. Guan Yu dispatched the remaining practitioners with ease - their spellcasting prowess no match for his martial mastery at close quarters. Before the cauldron, he unsheathed his Soul-Severing Blade.

“Guan Yu! Halt!” Wang Xiaorong’s voice rang out behind him.

Turning, he found the cult leader’s daughter glaring accusingly. “You’d sabotage our work? After all we’ve...”

“Forgive me,” Guan Yu interrupted, his blade already descending. “I cannot let your flames consume innocents.”

The cauldron exploded in a thunderous detonation. As debris rained down, Xiao Zhi disengaged from combat. “Retreat!” Guan Yu shouted, intercepting the pursuing Right Envoy with a qi blast.

Their escape via sword flight proved short-lived. With a flick of her whip, the Right Envoy yanked them back to earth. In the ensuing chaos, Wang Xiaorong pressed a dagger to Guan Yu’s throat in a theatrical display.

“Fools!” she proclaimed loudly. “Did you think to escape our stronghold?” Her eyes flashed a silent signal. In a practiced motion, Guan Yu reversed their positions, blade now at her neck. “Approach and she dies!”

The Right Envoy froze, powerless as the trio retreated with their “hostage.”

**Chapter 3767: Exposure**

In a secluded inn room, Wang Xiaorong complained, “You were supposed to release me after escaping! Why bring me here? What schemes are you brewing now?”

Xiao Zhi remained silent, uncomfortably aware they owed their freedom to her subterfuge. “I’m starving!” she continued petulantly. “Are you two just going to sit there?”

Guan Yu moved to fetch provisions, but Xiao Zhi intervened. “I’ll go. You two... talk.” His exit coincided with Yan Zhao’s arrival.

“Xiao Zhi! Where’s Guan Yu?” the senior disciple demanded. “We awaited your reconnaissance report!”

“We... encountered heavy resistance,” Xiao Zhi improvised. “Guan Yu sustained minor injuries but recovers.”

Yan Zhao’s eyes narrowed skeptically. “I’ll see him myself.”

“He rests now. Let him recover.” Steering Yan Zhao away, Xiao Zhi reported their findings to Manor Lord Lu - omitting Wang Xiaorong’s presence.

“The Right Envoy specializes in amplified formation magic,” Lord Lu warned. “Even with forty practitioners lost, her hundred-strong cadre remains. Our barrier lasts but one more day.”

Meanwhile at the inn, Wang Xiaorong confronted Guan Yu. “Does the manor lord know about your Eight-Sided Drum cultivation?”

“Unlikely. Why?”

“Your injuries stem from that unstable power. Come to the Soul Demon Sect. Let Father extract it before...”

“Never!” Guan Yu cut in. “Your father’s ambition with the Four Divine Arts...”

“I care not for divine beasts or Father’s schemes!” she cried. “Only your safety matters!”

Their argument dissolved into uneasy silence, broken by Xiao Zhi’s return with provisions. Under cover of night, their whispered plans were overheard by Yan Zhao lurking outside.

**Chapter 3768: Pretense**

“You’ve brought the cult leader’s daughter here?!” Yan Zhao seethed silently. Though tempted to expose them, fear of the Demon Lord’s retribution stayed his hand.

Alone with Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong nestled against him. “You’ll stay tonight, yes?”

“I must protect my savior,” he conceded.

“That Eight-Sided Drum technique... Join us. Let Father purge it.”

“And enable his resurrection of the Heavenly Ape God? Never.”

“But if you die...”

“This ‘martial-magic prodigy’ won’t fall easily,” Guan Yu deflected. “When I’m strong enough, I’ll face your father properly - as his son-in-law.”

Their tender moment shattered as Yan Zhao’s shadow lingered outside, schemes brewing. The protective barrier’s impending collapse loomed over all, its countdown ticking toward tomorrow’s noon - and with it, the flames of war waiting to erupt.
