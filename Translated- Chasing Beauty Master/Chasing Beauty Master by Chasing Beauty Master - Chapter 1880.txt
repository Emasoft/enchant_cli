Yu Kong could not comprehend why the Emperor insisted on implicating the Qin family. "Your Majesty," he ventured, "The Cao family's downfall is inevitable—their estate sealed and all enterprises halted. With only three great houses remaining in the capital, should the Qin family also fall, the remaining two would swell beyond control. A single dominant power benefits none. Preserving the Qin lineage would at least maintain checks and balances."

"Are you referring to the Tang and Duan families?" The Emperor's brow furrowed.

"Precisely," Yu Kong pressed. "Those two will greedily devour the Cao assets. If divided among three houses, the balance holds. But should two—or worse, one—monopolize these resources, within years we'd witness the birth of new colossi. This we cannot permit."

"Since when has the Qin family lacked influence?" The Emperor's voice turned glacial. "As foremost among the Four Great Houses, does not the Second Prince's consort flaunt her arrogance precisely through Qin backing?"

Understanding dawned on Yu Kong—His Majesty sought to prune both Qin's power and the Second Prince's influence. A most fortuitous realization.

Their discourse halted as guards announced: "Your Majesty, the Second Prince and Prime Minister Li seek audience, bearing gifts."

"Gifts?" The Emperor snorted. "As if their purpose eludes me." After brief deliberation, he commanded: "Admit them."

The Second Prince entered with ceremonial bow while Prime Minister Li prostrated fully.

"State your business," the Emperor demanded coldly.

"Imperial Father," the prince began, "Prime Minister Li and I discovered a marvelous treasure uniquely suited to Your Majesty's glory. We humbly present it now."

**Chapter 4941: The White Gemstone**

Prime Minister Li suppressed bitterness—this treasure was his sole discovery, yet credit flowed to the prince.

"Display it," the Emperor ordered listlessly.

Eight burly men strained to carry in a milky stone monolith—two meters long and over a meter tall—requiring special wheeled transport. "Careful!" Li fretted as they positioned it centrally.

His Majesty leaned forward, initially unimpressed by the massive rock. "Resembles...a crown?" he mused, noting its flattened base and peaked crests.

"Your discernment astounds!" The Second Prince glowed. "A natural coronet shaped through millennia! But observe the reverse..."

As they rotated the stone, golden veins within revealed four shimmering characters: 寿与天齐 (Longevity Equal to Heaven). The Emperor's stern visage softened with rare delight.

"Certified as rare white jade," Li interjected, hiding resentment. "Common specimens are thumbnail-sized. This colossus defies nature! The golden veins form internally—no chisel could craft this. Heaven itself proclaims Your Majesty's eternal reign!"

The Emperor descended to trace the subsurface patterns, marveling at their unblemished surface. Indeed, the characters seemed woven from celestial gold dust within the jade.

Yu Kong observed silently, earlier derision replaced by reluctant awe. What he'd mocked as quarry refuse transformed into peerless marvel before imperial approval.

**Chapter 4942: Reckoning**

"Place this beside Our Dragon Throne," the Emperor decreed, beaming. "Daily reminder of Heaven's mandate!"

While prince and sovereign rejoiced, Li seethed inwardly—his treasure gifted, yet rewards flowed disproportionately: a thousand silver taels and silks for the prince, mere hundred taels for himself.

Seizing the auspicious mood, Li ventured: "Regarding the Cao treason...while Cao patriarch deserves death, might Your Majesty consider sparing unwitting kin?"

The atmosphere chilled instantly. "Do you plead for traitors?" the Emperor thundered.

"Never!" Li kowtowed frantically. "Merely suggesting concentrated punishment avoids...excessive spillover."

"Spillover?" The Emperor's gaze turned dangerous. "Do you presume to dictate Our judgment?"

"Mercy, Your Majesty!" Li groveled. "This humble servant overstepped!"

Ruthless amusement flickered in the ruler's eyes. "Rise. We comprehend your...personal concerns." A meaningful pause. "Rest assured—wives and daughters shall be spared. Provided," his voice hardened, "no complicity is found. All conspirators—every last one—will burn."

**Chapter 4943: Unanswered Questions**

Later, in the First Prince's estate, Prince Zhou pondered courtly gambits. The Cao collapse presented opportunities—if they secured asset confiscation and drought relief missions before the Second Prince's faction intervened.

"Your thoughts seem heavy," the First Prince observed.

Zhou smiled tightly. Strategizing continued—every move critical in this lethal game of imperial favor.
