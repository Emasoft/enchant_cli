"Guan Yu was already floating on cloud nine. With a grand wave of his hand, he declared boldly, 'Speak up! Let your hubby solve this for you!'

Yet he failed to notice the mischievous glint that suddenly flickered in Wen Qing's warm smile.

'Honey, come host the gala with me!' Wen Qing said with a grin.

'Sure! Wait... what did you say?' Guan Yu agreed readily but soon realized something was amiss.

Host the gala?

Holy shit! This was something Guan Yu neither could nor wanted to do.

'Honey, the original host had a sudden emergency—he’s now a permanent resident of the restroom. You’re the only one who can help me now!' Wen Qing cooed, her pitifully adorable eyes pleading.

Guan Yu’s heart sank. He really wanted to slap himself twice. Why had he grandstanded earlier?

Rubbing his head awkwardly, he stammered, 'Well... uh... sweetheart, isn’t the school full of potential hosts? Can’t we just find someone else?'

'If we could, would I be asking you?' Wen Qing sighed.

'Then I’m out! Being a host means yakking in front of thousands. No way I’m doing that!' Guan Yu refused firmly.

'Not even if we host together as a couple?' Wen Qing countered.

'Nope! Absolutely not!' Guan Yu crossed his arms resolutely.

He’d rather face embarrassment than take the stage.

Wen Qing stomped her foot in frustration. She’d thought she’d trapped Guan Yu, only for him to climb right out of the pit.

But Guan Yu’s refusal sparked collective outrage. Onlookers glared daggers at him, itching to slap him and volunteer themselves.

Fucking ingrate, wallowing in luck yet oblivious!

Despite the murderous glares, Guan Yu stood firm, unyielding.

Wen Qing felt deflated. She’d forgotten Guan Yu’s aversion to the spotlight.

But she wasn’t ready to give up.

Suddenly, her eyes sparkled with cunning. She crooked a finger at Guan Yu, smiling innocently. 'Hubby, come here. I’ve a secret to share!'

Guan Yu eyed her warily but leaned in.

Wen Qing whispered in his ear.

Guan Yu’s mouth watered. 'Deal! I’ll do it!'

Wang Zhen, who’d been watching their flirtation, nearly stumbled, rolling his eyes in blatant disdain.

*Boss, where’s your resolve? Your dignity?*

Wen Qing’s smile widened. 'Hubby, it’s settled then!'

Guan Yu nodded eagerly, grinning slyly. 'You’d better keep your promise.'

Yet he hesitated. 'But sweetheart, I’ve never hosted before. Can I pull this off?'

'Hosting isn’t as hard as you think. Just follow my lead,' Wen Qing assured.

'That simple?'

'Exactly!'

'Got it. Go handle your tasks.' Guan Yu shamelessly patted Wen Qing’s derriere, chuckling.

Even the coquettish Wen Qing blushed, shooting him a look before hurrying off.

Unbeknownst to Guan Yu, that single gesture ignited murderous envy in countless men.

Watching Wen Qing’s retreating figure, Guan宇搓了搓手，anticipating her promise with a grin so lecherous it could curdle milk.

Wang Zhen couldn’t stomach it. 'Boss, you’ve got no backbone! Where’s your dignity?'

'Dignity your ass! You know nothing!' Guan Yu retorted, kicking Wang Zhen’s rear.

Wang Zhen rubbed his butt, grinning.

'Show me around. I’m lost here,' Guan Yu demanded.

'Can’t. I’m securing prime seats for Tian Hao and the crew,' Wang Zhen said.

'They appreciate art?' Guan宇 scoffed.

'Wrong! I’m telling them you’re hosting with Wen Qing. They’ll record your glorious debut!'

Wang Zhen bolted into the crowd before Guan宇 could retaliate.

'Record your grandpa!' Guan宇 yelled after him.

The term *glorious debut* left him fuming.

Backstage, Guan宇 found himself shoved into a dressing room.

Enter Wang Dachui, the event coordinator.

'Ensure nothing goes wrong tonight. The Education Bureau Director is here. Don’t embarrass us,' Wang Dachui droned.

'We’re prepared,' Wen Qing assured.

'And remind Gao维 to interact during her performance to boost the event’s impact,' Wang added.

After he left, Wen Qing smirked. 'The interaction task is yours. You’re closest to her.'

Guan宇 laughed nervously.

The grand opening commenced with thunderous applause. Wen Qing and Guan宇 stepped onstage.

'Distinguished guests, dear students, welcome to our centennial celebration!' Wen Qing’s voice enchanted the crowd.

'Evening,' Guan宇 deadpanned.

The crowd erupted in laughter.

'Introducing our honored guests,' Wen Qing continued.

'Welcome.' Guan宇 monotoned each time.

The audience howled.

'Now, let’s welcome Education Bureau Director Zhou Bo!'

'Clap,' Guan宇 instructed, clapping robotically.

Wen Qing shot him a glare; he grinned back.

The act continued, with Guan宇’s deadpan responses sending the crowd into fits.

Backstage, Wang Zhen and crew cackled. 'Record every glorious moment!'

Meanwhile, high above, a shadowy figure observed the chaos, muttering, 'The game begins.'"
