“Western Peach Blossom sacrificed her life, and now the lake waters finally calmed. The crowd sensed that the demonic beast in the depths, having been fed a human offering, had sated its hunger and improved its mood, thus ceasing to trouble the others.

Hovering midair, Xi Liu (Western Willow) remained suspended in dazed uncertainty, her heart a tumult of emotions.

Upon witnessing this, Wang Xiaorong cried out in shock, “Ah! Sister Xi Taohua (Western Peach Blossom) sacrificed herself! She saved everyone with her life!”

Her words resonated deeply, yet the unspoken truth lingered: while the calamity had been of their making and the resolution theirs, the irreversible cost was Xi Taohua’s death.

“Sister Taohua!” The disciples of the Strange Demon Cave knelt as one, the women weeping bitterly. Yet Zuo Shi, the Left Envoy, remained eerily composed.

With only one of the demonic king sisters of the Strange Demon Cave remaining, their threat had diminished. This mission, he believed, would now conclude smoothly.

Yet a new concern arose: Xi Liu, still hovering at the lake’s center. If she pressed onward, she might reach their destination first. Should she obtain the Eight-Sided Drum Technique, all would be lost.

Stunned by recent events, Xi Liu struggled to accept her sister’s demise. Grief clawed at her, but she shook her head fiercely, forcing clarity. She glanced toward the shore.

Her sister’s final words echoed: *“You must heed my last wish.”* Xi Liu nearly turned back, but the lake’s malevolence had quieted. Could she now cross unimpeded to Meng Hua the Ancestor’s underground palace?

Two warring impulses clashed—duty versus ambition. Greed triumphed. *If I fail to claim the technique,* she thought, *my sister’s death becomes meaningless.* Jaw set, she pivoted toward the palace.

Zuo Shi tracked her movement. With the lake’s threat subdued, he could not allow her progress. “Halt!” he roared, spiritual energy amplifying his voice across the waters. “Advance further, and your sisters will join Xi Taohua in death!”

Even Guan Yu’s group heard the threat. The Demonic Soul Sect encircled the Strange Demon disciples—leaderless and outmatched, their annihilation certain if provoked.

“How vile,” Xiao Zhi muttered.

“Demonic cultivators lack virtue,” Siqi added.

Wang Xiaorong bristled. “Hypocrites! Your righteous sects scheme and slaughter kin for power and prestige. Who are you to judge?”

“Repeat that.” Guan Yu gripped her arm, intensity startling both women. Wang Xiaorong’s words had kindled a memory—the monstrous abomination at Cloud Azure Sect, initially blamed on demonic infiltrators. Yet her implication suggested rot within the sect itself.

Realizing her slip, Wang Xiaorong bit her tongue. Others caught her meaning. “You claim,” Guan Yu pressed, “that Cloud Azure harbors practitioners of the Bloodwing Art?”

Under interrogation, she deflected: “Why feign surprise? Demonic spies permeate your ranks. If your ‘righteous’ fools serve us willingly, must I explain their motives?”

Guan Yu knew sect corruption ran deep—even Patriarch Xuanming failed to purge it. As Elder Zheng said: root out one traitor, two more sprout. Temptation or coercion bound them to the demonic path.

“Zuo Shi! Face me, coward!” Xi Liu’s voice sliced through the tension. “My sisters are blameless!”

The Left Envoy sneered. “Return now, and they live. Defy me, and Strange Demon Cave dies today.”

Torn, Xi Liu weighed retreat against betrayal. Even if Zuo Shi spared them, the Demonic Soul Sect’s master craved their eradication. Trusting his mercy was folly.

“Sister Liu, go!” cried a disciple. “Don’t mind us!”

Zuo Shi struck the speaker down. As the Strange Demon women stirred, his forces quashed rebellion. Xi Liu wavered—sacrifice herself? Or gamble on securing the technique to avenge them later?

“Sisters,” she declared, “hold fast! I *will* return to avenge you!” She soared toward the palace.

“Madwoman!” Zuo Shi barked. “After her! Kill any who resist!”

As the Demonic Soul cultivators pursued, their rearguard—a pair of fox demons—blocked others. Cui Hua (Jade Blossom) stood helpless.

Xiao Zhi pointed. “They’re moving. When do we follow?”

“Patience,” said Guan Yu. “Meng Hua’s palace won’t yield easily. Deadlier traps await there.”

“But what if they find it first?”

Guan Yu conceded. “We’ll track them. Cloud Azure’s swordflight outpaces theirs.”

As they ascended, the lake erupted. Walls of water rose, hemming all within a shrinking dome. Zuo Shi paled. “The beast deceived us! It’s herding us to slaughter!”

Xi Liu laughed bitterly. “How fitting—Demonic Soul scum dying beside me!”

“You knew this!” Zuo Shi accused.

“I relish your company in death,” she spat.

Guan Yu’s group converged with the others. Zuo Shi blanched upon seeing Wang Xiaorong. “Young Mistress! Why are you here?!”

“I was bored,” she quipped, though fear tightened her grip on Guan Yu.

Zuo Shi rounded on Guan Yu. “You dare endanger her?!”

“Fight later!” Xiao Zhi shouted.

The water ceiling collapsed—a crushing deluge. Wang Xiaorong clung to Guan Yu as the torrent engulfed them.

Consciousness returned with Wang Xiaorong atop Guan Yu, both sodden. She smiled, recalling how she’d held fast even as darkness took them.

On shore, Cui Hua wept. “Sister Liu… I failed you…”

Elsewhere, survivors stirred. The lake’s fury had deposited them… elsewhere. Alive, but to what end?
