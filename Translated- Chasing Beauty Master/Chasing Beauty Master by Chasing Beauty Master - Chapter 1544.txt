After the prince finished speaking, before Guan Yu could react, Zou Wuxiao grew impatient. At the mere mention of "drinking to oblivion," the man began salivating, his sensitivity to alcohol flaring up.

Guan Yu smiled and said, "Many thanks for Your Highness and Lord Mao's hospitality. This is truly an honor."

The prince rose with a chuckle. "Lord Mao, let me introduce these three—my lifesavers who have rescued me twice."

"Your Highness flatters us," Guan Yu interjected. "We merely drew our swords to aid others in need. Had you encountered anyone in peril, you would have done the same."

"Nonsense! You've shown me great kindness, and I repay my debts. Today, borrowing Lord Mao's estate, I shall properly host you."

Lord Mao also stood, nodding approvingly at the trio. "Heroes emerge from youth! Your prowess and righteousness at such a young age command admiration. On behalf of His Highness, I extend my gratitude."

Not to be outdone in courtesy, Guan Yu demurred, "You honor us, my lord. As mere commoners of the martial world, standing here in the City Lord's manor is privilege enough."

Prince Zou harbored doubts about the trio's motives. The previous night, he and Zou Wuhui had pondered—saving someone once might be coincidence, but twice with persistent escorting? Unusual. One didn't escort Buddha to the Western Heaven after drawing a blade.

The prince suspected hidden intentions, especially given their refusal to reveal true names. Zou Wuhui initially opposed keeping them close, fearing danger, yet the teahouse incident left him conflicted. Last night, he'd even speculated whether that ambush had been staged.

The prince dismissed such notions—assassins wouldn't bother with theatrics. Zou Wuhui countered they might seek future gains by attaching themselves to a potential emperor. Pragmatically, the prince welcomed their protection despite ulterior motives, though wary of their loyalty.

Hence this morning's lavish gifts—gold and fine wine—and tonight's banquet. Unbeknownst to the prince, Guan Yu's group hailed from Yunqing Sect, their identities concealed.

Chapter 4004: Honor

Zou Wuhui reluctantly acquiesced to their presence, remembering Guan Yu's teahouse rescue. With only Zou Wuxiao—a drunkard squandering his martial talent—and the circumspect Zou Wuhui as reliable aides, the prince gambled on utilizing the trio.

When Lord Mao offered soldiers as escorts, the prince accepted despite their inadequacy against real assassins. Every pawn might prove useful.

"Earlier discourtesies were mine," the prince now addressed Guan Yu. "More shameful still—I've yet to learn your esteemed names."

Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun remained silent, leaving Guan Yu to respond. "The fault is ours. We three met wandering the martial world, bonded by shared interests. Though not the eldest, these brothers call me 'elder.' This is Wang Jun—quick-witted strategist. And Xiao Zhi—simple-hearted but dependable."

Guan Yu divulged their real names, calculating the prince would tolerate Yunqing Sect connections if discovered.

"Delighted to know you better!" The prince's smile faltered as he neared Xiao Zhi. "But young Xiao... your face...?"

Five crimson finger marks bloomed on Xiao Zhi's swollen cheek.

Wang Jin guffawed, miming a chest-grope. "Slapped last night for accosting a girl!"

"Shut your trap!" Xiao Zhi growled as the prince chuckled.

"A misunderstanding, surely! Lord Mao, fetch medicinal ointment."

Chapter 4005: Complaints

Power dynamics manifested starkly—the mighty City Lord now jumped at the prince's slightest whim. When the prince ordered Lord Mao himself to retrieve medicine rather than a servant, none dared object.

That evening's banquet would feature theatrical troupes. Guan Yu expressed gratitude while subtly addressing the morning's gold gift—unknown to Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi, he'd overheard their squabble over the loot.

"Your morning generosity already suffices," Guan Yu declared, watching his companions pale. "I distributed the gold to these two, keeping only wine. No further repayment is needed."

Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi exchanged panicked glances—how had he known? Each suspected the other of betrayal.

The prince beamed. "This is but the beginning! Your escort through danger merits greater reward."

Later, cornered in Guan Yu's chamber, the pair confronted him. "How'd you know about the gold?!" Wang Jun demanded.

"Does it matter?" Guan Yu dismissed, examining the Emperor's Seal. "Just don't expect me to clean up your messes."

Chapter 4006: No Happy Endings

Swearing on Du Bingyan's name, each denied leaking the secret. Conceding defeat, they agreed to partial restitution.

Barging into Guan Yu's room unannounced, they found him stashing the Seal—its secrets of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique too volatile for Xiao Zhi's loose tongue.

"Here about the gold? Save your breath." Guan Yu's indifference unnerved them further.

Wang Jun's mind raced—had Guan Yu anticipated the prince's gift? Xiao Zhi's oafish denial rang true. Resigned, they prepared to surrender portions of their spoils, knowing Guan Yu's sharp mind left no room for deception.

In the shadows of power plays and shifting loyalties, their journey toward the capital continued—a dance of hidden agendas where every smile veiled calculation, and survival hinged on outthinking friend and foe alike.
