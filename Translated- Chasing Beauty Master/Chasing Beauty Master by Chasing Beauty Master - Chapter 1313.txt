“Now that Xiao Zhi mentioned it, everyone grew tense. Wang Xiaorong spread her hands and said, “Oh, stop worrying! Fortune and calamity are fated; what’s meant to be cannot be avoided. That Senior Brother Qi of yours may not be a good man, but at least he won’t harm his fellow disciples. Since he took Xiaotong (Morning Radiance) away, he’ll surely ensure her safety. As for where they’ve gone—well, that depends on whether Senior Brother Qi has other hideouts besides Blackblood Ridge.”

Xiao Zhi scratched his head. “We don’t know of any other hideouts he has. Even running into him at Blackblood Ridge was unexpected.”

“Could Senior Brother Qi have taken Xiaotong back to the Yunqing Sect?” Siqi suddenly interjected. “With Blackblood Ridge destroyed, he has nowhere else to go. Returning to the sect is his only safe option.”

Wang Xiaorong nodded emphatically. “Exactly! He must’ve gone back to the Yunqing Sect. Siqi’s sharp as ever. That Senior Brother Qi surely took Xiaotong to the sect, claiming he heroically rescued her from captivity to curry favor.”

“No way! Senior Brother Qi isn’t like that,” Xiao Zhi muttered. Had this happened before Senior Brother Qi’s true colors emerged, he’d have been the first to defend him.

But after recent events, Senior Brother Qi’s character flaws—his cowardice and lack of loyalty—were undeniable. Instead of aiding others during the crisis, he’d fled with Xiaotong in his arms, abandoning everyone else.

“Why not?” Wang Xiaorong retorted boldly. “I’d bet my life he’s using Xiaotong to claim credit. She was unconscious—she wouldn’t know who really saved her. After this, I’m convinced your Senior Brother Qi is a spineless coward who values his own skin above all else.”

Siqi remained silent. Had Senior Brother Qi helped fight the Blood Lord, Guanyu wouldn’t have been so gravely injured, nor would she have suffered such heavy blows.

Senior Brother Qi had clearly shrunk back when it mattered most. How could he abandon his own sect siblings in their hour of need?

Thus, when Wang Xiaorong accused him of exploiting Xiaotong for glory, Siqi didn’t object. She too doubted his integrity.

Second-to-Wolf chimed in, “From the moment I saw him, I knew he was rotten. You might not like hearing this, but your Senior Brother Qi reeks of dishonesty.

He loves flaunting nonexistent skills, leeching off others’ efforts. We risked our lives all night to save Xiaotong, nearly dying in the poplar grove. After finally defeating the Blood Lord, he swooped in at the last moment to ‘rescue’ her.

It was deliberate. Now he’ll boast to Sect Master Xuanming about his ‘heroic struggle’ while downplaying your contributions. By the time you return, he’ll have twisted the story—praising himself and painting you as incompetent fools who owed everything to him.

Mark my words: he’ll exaggerate your mistakes, downplay your efforts, and walk away rewarded while you’re punished. That’s how villains operate—striking first with lies.”

“Surely it won’t go that far?” Xiao Zhi said gloomily. “Guanyu did most of the work rescuing Xiaotong. Would Senior Brother Qi really steal all the credit?”

The group agreed with Second-to-Wolf’s assessment. If events unfolded as predicted, their return to the sect would inevitably bring harsh reprimands.

Wang Xiaorong snapped, “Xiao Zhi, what’s your problem? I know you dislike me, but watch your tongue! How is this ‘all Guanyu’s功劳’? Was I not there?”

**Chapter 3388: The More You Think, The Angrier You Get**

“Whether you count as human isn’t my concern—you’re not from the Yunqing Sect anyway. Or do you want credit too?” Xiao Zhi said dismissively. “Besides, you only helped for Guanyu’s sake. Doesn’t that still count as his功劳?”

Wang Xiaorong rolled her eyes. “Fine, I won’t argue. I don’t care about your sect’s rewards. But as Second-to-Wolf said, even Guanyu will face punishment upon returning. Forget about rewards.”

Siqi shook her head. “I can’t believe Senior Brother Qi would do this... but his actions were inexcusable. When we met Second-to-Wolf in the wine cellar, his arrogance was palpable—so unlike his former self. Why did he flee with Xiaotong while we fought?”

“Why dwell on it?” Second-to-Wolf cut in. “If you don’t care about rewards, let it go. Once Senior Brother Qi returns, your sect will soon recall you.”

Wang Xiaorong harbored another thought: Senior Brother Qi mustn’t die yet. He could prove useful to the Demon Soul Sect.

As a Blackblood Ridge overseer, he’d have ingested their lethal loyalty poison. If he still valued his righteous identity enough to seek sect approval, he’d be easier to manipulate.

Having retrieved life-extending antidotes from the Blood Lord’s corpse, Wang Xiaorong planned to have Demon Soul alchemists replicate them. Surviving Blackblood Ridge members could then be recruited.

With the bat token in hand, she could also gather scattered followers to bolster the sect’s forces.

“If Senior Brother Qi really does this, I’ll never speak to him again!” Aze grumbled. “We risked our lives only for him to profit. And Guanyu’s badly injured—it makes my blood boil!”

“Save your breath,” Second-to-Wolf warned. “We’re alive. Constantly bringing up dangers faced makes you no better than him.”

“Enough speculation,” Siqi said. “Guanyu’s recovery matters most. Second-to-Wolf, what did Guanyu use to kill the Blood Lord? The Imperial Seal?”

In the chaos, only Xiaotong and Second-to-Wolf had glimpsed Guanyu’s pistol—a modern weapon inexplicable here. Guanyu had discreetly holstered it before collapsing.

Second-to-Wolf hesitated. “Not the Imperial Seal—its spells would’ve collapsed the cavern. It looked like... a hidden weapon? A loud one that pierced the Blood Lord’s skull.”

“Even you don’t know?” Xiao Zhi said, baffled. “We’ll have to ask Guanyu when he wakes.”

Dawn broke. After breakfast, exhaustion set in—their nerves still raw from the night’s horrors.

Wang Xiaorong stood. “Guanyu’s stable. I’ll take my leave. If he needs me, have him send word.”

After she departed, Second-to-Wolf kept vigil while others rested. Guanyu’s desperate gunshot had saved Xiaotong—a move none could comprehend, but all owed their lives to.

**Chapter 3389: Coquetry**

Riding west of Qujiang City, Wang Xiaorong stopped at a roadside tea stall. She needed to report Blackblood Ridge’s fall to the Demon Lord—a triumph for their sect, which had long sought to subdue the rival faction.

Upon returning, she found the Demon Lord playing chess with his Left Envoy. Leaping into his lap, she cooed, “Daddy! I’m back!”

“Little imp,” the Demon Lord chided affectionately. “Must you lack decorum before others?”

At fiftyish, with jet-black hair streaked white at the temples, his piercing eyes and regal bearing commanded respect. His gray robe bore an embroidered golden dragon.

Left Envoy bowed. “Young Mistress, shall I fetch you dinner after you rest?”

“Later. I’ve urgent news.” She kicked over the chessboard. “Listen to me!”

The Demon Lord dismissed Left Envoy. “What mischief have you found now?”

“Remember Guanyu of Yunqing Sect? The one with three artifacts: Soulfall Blade, Imperial Seal, and Flaming Crucible?”

“Your spies told you that much,” Wang Xiaorong teased. “But did they mention he’s a dual cultivator—martial and demonic arts?”

The Demon Lord froze. “Impossible! Such haven’t existed since Yunqing’s founder!”

“I checked myself! His qi and spiritual energy coexist, healing his wounds. Only dual cultivation allows that!”

“Xuanming’s fool!” the Demon Lord spat. “Letting such talent wander unprotected—”

As he rose, intent on striking, Wang Xiaorong pulled him back. “Wait! There’s more...”
