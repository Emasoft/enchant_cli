The old man before them clearly lacked such prowess. Guan Yu’s first Battle Qi Slash streaked forth with blinding speed—even swifter than the spells Xiaomei had cast earlier—as it hurtled toward the elder.

The strike was too fast. By the time the old man registered his shock, the slash was already upon him, leaving no room to dodge. He could only brace himself.

The elder spun his cane before him, intercepting the attack. Though he blocked it, Guan Yu remained rooted in place, unleashing an unrelenting barrage of Battle Qi Slashes without pause.

Guan Yu moved as if dancing, each swing of his blade releasing another arc of energy. The old man, with no means to counter, could only desperately parry. To all watching, it was clear the elder was faltering.

Such a spectacle left the crowd breathless. Never had any of them witnessed such a display. A hushed awe gripped the onlookers, as if even a single exhalation might shatter the tension.

The scene was utterly breathtaking, akin to a masterful acrobatic performance. Behind Guan Yu, Xiaomei cheered excitedly, “Guan Yu’s amazing! I’m so envious!”

Miss Dong (Thousand Gold), the young mistress of the Dong Family, watched Guan Yu’s figure with a distant gaze. In her mind, he had become the challenger who’d stepped onto the stage. A man like this—if he could be hers—she might gladly accept.

Previously, the Dong Family had engaged countless matchmakers to introduce wealthy young masters, both local and distant. Yet none proved suitable. Now, with their daughter of marriageable age, they’d resorted to hosting this martial tournament to select a son-in-law.

Patriarch Dong had lowered his standards. As the family’s sole heiress, his daughter needed a husband willing to marry into their household and inherit the Dong legacy. But such a demand was deemed excessive among noble families.

Wealthy scions seldom agreed to “reverse marriage,” surrendering sons they’d raised with care. Those willing often lacked the qualities the Dongs sought, creating an impasse.

This tournament had been a last resort, hoping to attract a capable candidate. Yet from the start, it had been disrupted by this old man.

Now, whether order could be restored hinged on Guan Yu’s victory. Though their clash seemed evenly matched, Guan Yu grew anxious. His slashes either missed, striking distant walls, or were deflected by the elder.

**Chapter 4680: An Eye-Opening Spectacle**

The old man’s strength far exceeded Guan Yu’s expectations. In all his travels, Guan Yu had never encountered someone who could withstand his Battle Qi Slashes.

Gradually, however, the elder began to falter. Guan Yu’s relentless assault—swift and potent—overwhelmed his defenses.

Suddenly, the old man spat blood. A final slash struck him full-force, hurling him off the stage. He crashed to the ground below, defeated.

Guan Yu stood tall, Soulfall Blade in hand, vigilant in case the elder rose to continue the fight.

“Yay! Guan Yu, you’re the best!” Xiaomei leapt up, her admiration for him soaring.

The disheveled old man slowly rose, clutching his cane. Blood stained his robes. After a final glance at Guan Yu, he wordlessly turned and limped away.

Only after his departure did the crowd erupt into cheers. Whether celebrating the elder’s defeat or marveling at Guan Yu’s prowess, all regarded him with newfound reverence.

With the matter settled, Siqi approached. “Guan Yu, Miss Dong wishes to thank you.”

“No need,” Guan Yu replied coolly. “I merely righted a wrong. Let’s depart.”

Yet Miss Dong stepped forward, offering a graceful bow. “Thank you for your aid, young master. To express our gratitude, would you honor us with a visit to our estate?”

“Your kindness is appreciated,” Guan Yu declined, “but we have pressing matters.” As he turned to leave, Patriarch Dong’s voice boomed from afar: “Young master, wait!”

The patriarch hurried over, scrutinizing Guan Yu. “Such remarkable skill! Today, I’ve witnessed true marvels.”

“You flatter me, Patriarch Dong. It was a trivial effort.” Guan Yu smiled politely and turned again to go.

“A moment!” The patriarch stroked his beard, eyeing Xiaomei and Siqi. “Since you’ve triumphed, you may claim the embroidered ball. You’ll then be our Dong Family’s betrothed.”

Guan Yu stiffened. “A misunderstanding, surely? I intervened merely to assist, not to compete.”

Patriarch Dong’s smile faded. “Do you scorn our Dong Family? Or deem my daughter—Camel Town’s foremost beauty—unworthy?”

“Father!” Miss Dong interjected, flushing. Accustomed to adulation since birth, she now felt acute embarrassment before Xiaomei and Siqi.

Guan Yu frowned. “I’ve made myself clear: I’m not a contestant.”

“Our tournament is no jest!” the patriarch snapped. “By stepping onto that stage, you accepted its terms. Victory binds you to the outcome!”

Guan Yu realized the patriarch’s ploy: having witnessed his prowess and bearing, the man sought to forcibly claim him as a son-in-law.

Xiaomei scoffed. “Patriarch Dong, is your daughter so desperate? Must you seize handsome men in broad daylight?”

Though crudely phrased, her words held truth.

“How dare you mock us?” The patriarch’s face darkened. “Think your strength grants you license to disrespect our Dong Family? Our word is law! If you leave, our honor crumbles!”

“Father, cease this humiliation!” Miss Dong pleaded.

Guan Yu sighed. “Patriarch, your daughter understands my intent. Moreover”—he pulled Siqi close—“I already have a companion.”

Siqi glowed with happiness at being acknowledged. Miss Dong’s hopeful gaze dimmed.

“A jest, of course!” The patriarch forced a laugh. “But surely you’ll dine with us?”

“We decline.” Guan Yu bowed. “Your tournament continues. Farewell.”

**Chapter 4681: Returning Home**

Back at the inn, Xiaomei pestered Guan Yu to explore the town, relenting only after his stern warning.

The next morning, the group departed at leisure. After days of travel, they reached the foot of Cloud Azure Sect’s mountains.

Guan Yu settled Xiaomei nearby, instructing her to wait near Redpeak Mountain outside the capital. Reluctant but obedient, she agreed.

At Cloud Azure Sect, Elder Lu greeted them warmly at Front Return Peak. “You’ve endured much.”

“We failed to recover the Eight-Drum Art,” Guan Yu admitted.

“No blame lies with you,” Elder Lu said. “Report to Sect Master, then rest.”

In Tiger Head Peak’s grand hall, Sect Master Xuanming awaited. “Are you certain none obtained the Eight-Drum Art? Could the Demon Soul Sect have seized it secretly?”

“None could have,” Guan Yu insisted. “The Demon Soul Sect’s forces were as lost as we. The city’s vastness and time constraints thwarted all.”

Xuanming’s eyes narrowed. “Yet their mobilization suggests purpose. How can you be certain?”

“My companions attest to it,” Guan Yu replied. “We barely grasped the city’s layout before expulsion.”

**Chapter 4682: Inquiry**

Xuanming demanded a full account. Guan Yu obliged, detailing their trials—omitting only the artifact now hidden on his person.

As he spoke, he noted the sect master’s indifference to their hardships. Only the artifact mattered. Bitterly, Guan Yu realized their suffering meant little to those in power. Yet duty bound him to the tale, his comrades’ silent presence a testament to shared ordeal.
