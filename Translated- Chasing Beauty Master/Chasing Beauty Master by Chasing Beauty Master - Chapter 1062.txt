Gazing into Guan Yu’s clear eyes, Ma Tong found himself inclined to believe the young man more at this moment. The recent incidents of his casinos being trashed might indeed have been orchestrated by Bill Lin and Fang Su to frame Guan Yu.

However, Ma Tong knew better than to provoke Bill Lin. “I don’t care which of you sent people to sabotage my properties,” he said coldly. “But I want this to be the last time. Let today’s matter end here. I’ll let bygones be bygones. From now on, we go our separate ways—no further entanglements.”

With that, Ma Tong turned and walked away, waving a dismissive hand. “Home!”

**Chapter 2715: All Outsiders**

No one had expected the confrontation to end so abruptly. Bill Lin felt a mix of relief and frustration—relief that their scheme hadn’t been exposed, sparing them a disastrous night, yet irritation that Guan Yu remained unscathed.

Fang Su and Bill Lin exchanged uneasy glances, both sensing the confusion in each other’s eyes. Now wasn’t the time to discuss it. With Ma Tong’s men retreating, their priority was to escape swiftly.

Guan Yu made no move to stop Fang Su. The night’s chaos had left him wary. With only Xue Jing by his side and hidden adversaries lurking, recklessness could prove fatal. Letting Fang Su live a few more days was a tactical choice.

As Fang Su drove away, his face grim, Bill Lin’s incessant nagging filled the car.

“Couldn’t you at least send competent lackeys? Your man got caught by Guan Yu’s people! If that idiot hadn’t been silenced, he’d have exposed us! Ma Tong would’ve turned on us both! Why can’t you channel your womanizing ‘skills’ into something useful?”

Fang Su massaged his temples, exasperated. “It’s over, isn’t it? And it wasn’t my fault! The man I sent was sharp. Blame Guan Yu for being sharper. Still, your move to kill Xiao Mu was timely—brilliant, really.”

“*My* move?” Bill Lin blinked. “I didn’t order Xiao Mu’s death. Wasn’t that you?”

“Wait—you didn’t?” Fang Su frowned. “I thought you had a hidden expert protecting you. If not you, then who?”

“I’ve got no one! Luo Bo’s vanished. I assumed *you* did it!”

They stared at each other, mutual bewilderment deepening.

Bill Lin gulped from a water bottle, frustration simmering. “Everything was going smoothly until Guan Yu outplayed us. Now Ma Tong’s lost to us for good.”

Fang Su sighed. “But who killed Xiao Mu? The strike was too precise. If he hadn’t died when he did, we’d have been exposed.”

“Guan Yu was right,” Bill Lin muttered. “The assassin was a master. That needle came from our direction. Could Ma Tong have someone aiding us?”

“Unlikely. Ma Tong’s men are all outsiders—no ties to us. Why help? And does he even have such experts?”

Bill Lin conceded the point, yet the mystery remained. That unseen hand had saved their lives.

Fang Su grimaced. “If Xiao Mu had talked, *you’d* have been safe—Ma Tong wouldn’t dare touch the mighty Bill heir. But I’d have lost half my life.”

“Enough!” Bill Lin snapped. “Your incompetence cost us Ma Tong as an ally. Never trusting your men again.”

Fang Su shot back, “The plan was sound! Guan Yu’s just too cunning—he anticipates us! But Ma Tong never truly wanted him dead. Otherwise, he’d have attacked immediately, not wasted time talking.”

Bill Lin agreed. Ma Tong’s grand show of force—hundreds of men at Guan Yu’s doorstep—had been a bluff. Fear of Guan Yu’s formidable connections kept him restrained.

Back at the Fang residence, the shrill cries of a woman echoed from Feng Shaoye’s room—a routine spectacle. Feng Shaoye, perpetually engrossed in carnal pursuits, paid no mind to the world beyond his indulgences.

Bill Lin and Fang Su slumped in the lounge, too despondent to react to the noises.

Feng Shaoye emerged, smirking. “Back so soon? Expected you’d be drinking yourselves half-dead with Ma Tong.”

“Spare us the sarcasm,” Bill Lin grumbled. “Your ‘brilliant’ plan nearly got us killed.”

“*My* fault?” Feng Shaoye descended the stairs, twirling a pink toy. “Blame your bungling subordinates. If not for me sending Luo Bo to kill Xiao Mu, you’d be corpses now.”

Bill Lin gaped. “*You* sent Luo Bo?”

Feng Shaoye struck a pose. “Indeed. I had him shadow you—just in case.”

“Where is Luo Bo now?”

“Resting. His injuries aren’t fully healed.”

**Chapter 2716: Seeking Wisdom**

Fang Su pressed, “Explain properly. How’d you know Guan Yu caught Xiao Mu?”

Feng Shaoye lounged, toying with his gadget. “I didn’t. But after my sister Feng Xihu warned me about Guan Yu’s cunning, I worried. When Luo Bo returned from recuperating, I sent him to protect you. He acted when things turned dire.”

Bill Lin exhaled. “Thank Luo Bo—and you—for that.”

Feng Shaoye preened. “Experience made me wiser. Guan Yu’s a fox—always plan for the worst. Leave yourself an escape route.”

Fang Su feigned admiration. “How’d you get so shrewd? Teach me.”

“By being humbled repeatedly,” Feng Shaoye said drily. “My sister warned: oppose Guan Yu, and the Feng family falls. But Bill Lin here dragged us back in.”

Bill Lin snorted. “Fear won’t topple him. I’ll have his women and his head.”

The next morning, Guan Yu surveyed the cleaned-up crime scene, Xiao Mu’s corpse long removed. The prior night’s close call haunted him—a single needle, undetected, could’ve ended him or Xue Jing.

He pocketed the poison-tipped needle in a small box, resolved to visit Jin Hua. But first, he needed to divert Xue Jing.

At the Yang family’s clinic, Guan Yu found Shuangshuang cheerfully studying with a tutor. Her aunt greeted him warmly.

“Big Brother!” Shuangshuang beamed. “I’m studying hard, just like you wanted!”

Guan Yu smiled. “Good. I’ve enrolled you in Kaihuang Academy. Top class.”

Delight turned to shock when Guan Yu mentioned the exorbitant tuition.

“T-Ten thousand?” her aunt stammered.

“Per semester,” Guan Yu said gently.

Tears welled in Shuangshuang’s eyes. “I’ll make it worth it! I promise!”

Xue Jing squeezed the aunt’s hand. “Let us do this for her.”

Reluctantly, the aunt nodded, gratitude and guilt entwined.

**Chapter 2717: Cost of Knowledge**

As the tutor resumed the lesson, Guan Yu’s mind wandered to Jin Hua—her safety precarious under the Yang family’s shadow. Yang Patriarch’s growing power loomed, a threat even Guan Yu might struggle to counter.

But today’s priority was the needle. Its origin could unravel the mystery of last night’s savior—or assassin.
