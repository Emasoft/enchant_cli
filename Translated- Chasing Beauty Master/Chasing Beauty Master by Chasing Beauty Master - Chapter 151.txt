Guan Yu inwardly preened with smug satisfaction, narcissistically convinced that if he ever pursued acting, his dashingly handsome features would effortlessly captivate millions of girls. At this rate, even Gao Wei's current stardom would pale in comparison.

Chuckling at this thought, he glanced around the still-chaotic exercise yard. Police reinforcements hadn't yet arrived. Xiao Xiong sidled up and whispered, “Where’s that Silver Ring snake?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “No idea.”

Xiao Xiong’s expression froze before rolling his eyes in blatant disbelief. Niu Le playfully punched Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Bro, quit joking. A top-tier beast tamer like you wouldn’t lose track?”

Wryly smiling, Guan Yu admitted he truly didn’t know. He’d ordered the snake to vanish after biting its target. Seeing his earnest expression, both men tensed, scanning their surroundings warily. They’d assumed he still controlled the serpent.

Observing their synchronized anxiety, Guan Yu burst into laughter. Niu Le fretted, “Aren’t you worried it might bite you? You’ve seen its venom!”

Xiao Xiong suddenly relaxed. “Forgot we’ve got a master beast tamer here. We’re just worrying over nothing!” Slapping his thigh, Niu Le exclaimed, “Right! Bro, you let me panic for nothing!”

“You seemed calm earlier,” Guan Yu retorted. Niu Le scratched his head sheepishly.

Truthfully, Guan Yu lacked the energy to control the snake. Healing Niu Le had drained his reserves, leaving him lightheaded. He needed replenishment urgently. Sugar was inaccessible in detention. Electricity became his only option.

As he pondered, armed police stormed the yard. A fortyish officer fired a warning shot. “Silence! Or I’ll execute rioters!” The crowd froze.

Chapter 371: Stealing Electricity

The commander barked orders as prisoners formed lines. Guan Yu noticed Niu Le’s swollen knee – stabilizing his friend required immediate energy. Jail cells lacked outlets; he needed access to the office area through the right passage.

Leaning forward, Guan Yu whispered his plan to Niu Le. The younger man whirled around. “What?!”

The outburst drew attention. “Finally confessing?” The officer gestured guards toward Niu Le. Guan Yu intercepted their baton strikes with lightning punches enhanced by his gravity system, sending officers sprawling.

“Dare attack police?!” The commander fired. Guan Yu dodged the bullet that struck another prisoner. “Son of a bitch!” He lunged forward but halted at dozens of raised guns.

A whispered message stayed the commander’s hand. “Stand down!” he gritted, clearly restraining himself. “All prisoners return to cells!”

Panicking, Guan Yu realized his failed plan – until remembering the missing snake. Activating his animal control system, he reconnected with the Silver Ring. “Bite my finger lightly. Now!”

As chaos erupted from the snake’s sudden appearance, Guan Yu pretended to fall. Niu Le stomped the serpent in panic, forcing a real bite. Venom surged through Guan Yu’s veins as darkness encroached. Desperately, he activated his healing system...

Chapter 372: Bitten

The commander sneered at Guan Yu’s writhing form. “Should’ve bought lottery tickets today!” Niu Le stammered in horror while officers watched indifferently.

Guan Yu’s vision blurred as the neurotoxin attacked. His healing energy fought the venom in a desperate race against time, every cell screaming for the electrical charge that could save them both.
