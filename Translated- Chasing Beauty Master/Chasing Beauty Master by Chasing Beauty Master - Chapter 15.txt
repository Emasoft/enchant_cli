Standing in front of the girls' dormitory, Guan Yu halted his steps, his mind swirling with chaotic thoughts.

“Wait here, I’ll go upstairs and get it for you!” Du Xiaojuan waved casually at him with a lively smile before darting inside.

A few minutes later, she emerged with a crestfallen expression.

Seeing her dejected look, Guan Yu blinked in surprise and approached curiously. “What’s wrong?”

“I…I just remembered. I didn’t get the key from them for the bar. I…still can’t get back into the dorm!”

Damn it…why didn’t you mention this earlier? We’re already at the door!

Guan Yu chuckled wryly, eyeing the scatterbrained girl. Du Xiaojuan giggled awkwardly, her gaze flitting away in embarrassment.

“Alright…I’ll head back then. Just bring the phone tomorrow when we meet!”

“Mhm…I will! Promise!” She nodded solemnly, pressing her lips together.

After walking a few steps, Guan Yu turned back uneasily. “Don’t forget! Pack the phone first thing tomorrow morning, got it? Better put it in your bag tonight!”

“Relax, you nag!” Blushing, Du Xiaojuan glared at the curious girls peeking at them from nearby, wrinkling her nose in mock irritation.

After spending a few yuan on a hearty bowl of hand-pulled noodles at a roadside stall—cheap, filling, and satisfying—Guan Yu returned to his sparse hostel room. With no television or distractions, boredom gnawed at him.

Idly, his thoughts drifted to the ancient coin within him. The three distinct abilities granted by its activated systems still felt wondrously novel. Peeling off the tissue from his palm, he triggered the healing system. A cool surge of energy flowed toward his wound, and within minutes, he watched in awe as the raw flesh paled and scabbed over.

Such miraculous recovery speed! Though his palm still throbbed faintly, the pain had dulled significantly. Yet he reminded himself soberly: even this power couldn’t save him from instant fatal blows. Overreliance would be folly.

Leaning against the headboard, he cycled through the coin’s abilities. The gravity system’s versatility thrilled him—enhancing his speed and strength or crippling opponents with debilitating weight. Still, its application required refinement, especially against formidable foes.

As for the scanning system…Guan Yu smirked. Initially seeming niche, its ability to glimpse vague thoughts and backgrounds had understated value. In a world of hidden motives, such foresight was priceless. And in interactions with girls? Well…

His grin widened. Life had certainly grown more colorful.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Miraculous Discovery**

Restless and bored, Guan Yu tossed on the bed. Too early to sleep, yet the silence pressed heavily. Just as he considered venturing to an internet café, voices—a man and a woman—drifted from the hallway, followed by a door clicking open nearby.

Hmm…neighbors? Lovers sneaking around?

Eavesdropping yielded only muffled murmurs. Curiosity piqued, he wondered: could the scanning system pierce walls? On a whim, golden light flickered in his mind—the system activated!

Eureka! Intent alone could trigger the abilities!

Excited, he unleashed the scanning system. Heat pulsed through his eyes, probing the wall…but no visuals came. Only fragmented details about the pair’s backgrounds.

Disappointed, he scanned the room’s objects instead. The chair: three years old, bought secondhand for twenty-five yuan. The cup: once used as a urinal. The pillow: a prop for past trysts.

Ugh. Ignorance truly was bliss.

Yet an epiphany struck—antique appraisal! With this power, he could dominate the artifact market, detecting fakes effortlessly. A golden cheat code!

Ecstatic, Guan Yu paced, grinning like a fool. Luck had crowned him!

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Noble Gentleman Among Flowers**

The next morning, after breakfast, Guan Yu loitered by the school gate. Spotting Du Xiaojuan’s approach, he momentarily froze.

She bounded over in cropped pants, her calves porcelain-white beneath a prim yellow blouse. Her hair fluttered playfully, a sprite in human form.

“Did you bring my phone?”

“Oops…forgot again!” She blinked innocently.

“You’ll be death of me!” He groaned.

Giggling, she produced the Nokia. “Ta-da! How could I forget after your nagging?”

Relieved, Guan Yu twirled the phone. “To the flower market. Know the way?”

“Follow me!” She marched ahead, chin high.

After futilely flagging taxis, they boarded a packed bus. Squeezed together at the front, Du Xiaojuan’s soft warmth pressed against Guan Yu. A sharp turn flung her against his chest, her blush deepening.

As lecherous stares crept toward her, Guan Yu shielded her, earning a grateful smile. She looped her arms around his waist, steadying herself. Each jolt of the bus sent her curves brushing against him—a sweet torment.

When sudden braking nearly toppled her, Guan Yu’s hand slid into her waistband, fingertips grazing the edge of her panties. Flustered, he yanked back, but the lurching vehicle drove his fingers deeper.

For fuck’s sake…where did I just touch?
