When Guan Yu arrived at school, as he was now considered the undisputed ruler of the campus, everyone avoided him like he was some evil star.

This treatment made Guan Yu deeply uncomfortable. At the very least, while boys kept their distance, he wished more girls would approach him instead.

In the classroom, Lü Mei brought him a cup of milk tea. She had learned of Guan Yu’s return to school today through Wei Hongwei, as her daily routine involved pestering Wei for updates on Guan Yu more than studying.

Guan Yu sipped the milk tea warmly. With class still a while away, the entire school buzzed with news of the incoming beautiful principal. Most students peered out windows, while others crowded outside the building to catch a glimpse.

“She’s here, she’s here!” Wei Hongwei shouted as he rushed into the classroom.

At his cry, students swarmed the windows. Jia Bo, who arrived late and couldn’t secure a good spot, suggested, “How can we see the principal’s beauty from here? Let’s go outside!”

Deeming this reasonable, the entire class surged out. Guan Yu pulled Lü Mei along, only to find students from other classes flooding the corridors and playground—all eager to witness the new principal’s arrival.

Not just boys, but even girls crowded beneath welcome banners strung across the campus. Every path the principal might take teemed with students.

Guan Yu and Lü Mei pushed through the throng outside the building, where the crowd had blocked the principal’s route.

A lotus-colored sports car pulled into the parking lot. The door opened, revealing an exquisitely elegant woman—the new principal.

Though she appeared under thirty, her aura belied her youthful face. Guan Yu sensed she wasn’t as young as she looked.

As she approached, passing students politely greeted, “Good morning, Principal.”

“Wow, she’s stunning! Rich, mature—like she’s dripping with allure. Absolute perfection!” Wei Hongwei craned his neck admiringly.

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. When the principal drew closer, he sighed heavily. Puzzled, Lü Mei asked, “Guan Yu, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing. Let’s head back.” He tried tugging her away.

But the principal had already neared them. Spotting Guan Yu’s tall figure standing out even in the crowd, she remarked coldly, “Guan Yu, does seeing me annoy you so much?”

Turning with a cheeky grin, Guan Yu chuckled, “Heh, Sister Shilei, here to visit?”

“Nonsense. I’m the principal now. Got a problem with that?” The woman was none other than Liu Shilei, whose presence made Guan Yu groan internally—she and Du Xiaojuan had become overbearing figures in his life, now extending their oversight to his school.

Students gaped at their familiar banter, speculating wildly about their relationship.

“Holy crap! Guan knows the new hottie principal?!”

“Unbelievable! He already runs this school, and now the principal’s his sister? The Kaihuang Academy might as well be renamed Guan’s Domain!”

“He called her ‘sister’! How?!”

Ignoring the chatter, Guan Yu muttered, “Weren’t you content being principal elsewhere? Why come here? Need a replacement? I can recommend someone.” Though her presence offered advantages, it meant new constraints.

Liu Shilei ignored him, eyeing Lü Mei instead. “We’re practically sisters now. If Guan Yu misbehaves, tell me—I’ll discipline him.”

“You’re conspiring right in front of me?!” Guan Yu protested.

“Deal with it,” Liu Shilei retorted, striding inside as rumors of their sibling connection spread like wildfire.

Later, Guan Yu learned Liu Shilei’s appointment was temporary until a permanent principal could be found.

Meanwhile, Sun Heizi seethed with rage. After police found no evidence of the intruders he’d sent, he resolved to destroy Guan Yu, hiring two supernatural organizations—Darkness and Qinglong—for a decisive strike.

Unbeknownst to Sun, Yang Conghan, a Qinglong member and Guan Yu’s acquaintance, leaked the plan. By noon, Guan Yu had relocated his vulnerable companions to the Yang residence while preparing defenses with allies like Qiongsi and Xue Jing.

“Without Conghan’s warning, we’d have walked into a trap,” Guan Yu mused in Qiongsi’s office.

“They’re minor leagues,” Qiongsi shrugged. “I once worked with Darkness’s leader. We’ll handle this.”

Guan Yu proposed targeting Sun directly, but reconnaissance took priority. By evening, the trio dined calmly at Xue Jing’s villa, awaiting the assault with an invisible net of countermeasures.

Though Xue Jing suggested involving the Dragon Group to crush the illegal organizations, Guan Yu preferred personal retribution.

At the Yang residence, anxious Āmei tried distracting herself with Zhang Han’s chess request, while miles away, Sun Heizi’s convoy of 150 supernaturals rolled toward the villa—his confidence inflated by numbers, ignorant of Guan Yu’s equal forces.

When the horde arrived, Guan Yu stood ready with Qiongsi and Xue Jing. Sun sneered, “Kneel, kowtow, call me ‘Grandpa,’ and I’ll let you live crippled.”

Guan Yu mirrored the threat mockingly. As tensions peaked, engines roared—Qiongsi’s Liberty Organization reinforcements surrounded the compound, outnumbering Sun’s forces.

Recognition flashed between Qiongsi and Darkness’s leader Li Baitian, former rivals. Sun’s bravado faltered as Guan Yu offered a final mercy: “Repeat your terms to yourself. Last chance.”

Cornered, Sun barked orders, but his mercenaries wavered before the Liberty Organization’s might. The standoff hung heavy—a storm of three hundred supernaturals poised to clash, while fleeing police abandoned all pretense of control.

Guan Yu stepped forward, the predator to Sun’s prey. “Time’s up.”
