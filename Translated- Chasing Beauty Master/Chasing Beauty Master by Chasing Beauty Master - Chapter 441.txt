The two experts frowned, wanting to intervene, but Zhou Xiaochuan drove them out. He understood that Guan Yu might employ further methods unsuitable for elderly witnesses.

"Will you talk? If not, half your internal organs will be devoured soon!"

"You... you’re so ruthless..." The middle-aged man spat out the words with effort.

"Takes one to know one." Guan Yu’s expression remained calm, as if unaffected by the scene before him. "Don’t think about biting your tongue or any other tricks. Your petty schemes are useless against me. Your life is in my hands now."

Since gaining his supernatural abilities, Guan Yu had never been this cruel. By nature, he wasn’t heartless, but extracting the man’s secrets demanded severity.

"Speak! What’s your name, and why are you different from ordinary people?"

"I... I’m Ah Fa!" Under the torment of the Heart-Devouring Insect, the man finally broke. "Stop... stop! I’ll talk, I’ll talk..."

Guan Yu halted the insect’s activation. "Why are you different? How did you poison Miss Zhou? And what’s the meaning of ‘cauldron’?"

"The cauldron is for refining medicine. Zhou Xiaoyou’s body is perfect for our Qi-Gathering Pill. That’s why we chose her! The medicinal seed was planted in her through Zhou Xiaofeng!"

The man spoke haltingly.

"That unfilial son!" Zhou Xiaochuan had suspected Zhou Xiaofeng’s involvement when bringing Ah Fa back, given their apparent rapport. Hearing confirmation, rage burned through him. Zhou Xiaoyou was his chosen successor!

**Chapter 1102: The Cultivation World**

As Zhou Xiaochuan stirred to confront Zhou Xiaofeng, Guan Yu interjected calmly, "Settle accounts later. Let him finish first."

"Explain how to cure my granddaughter!" Though Guan Yu could heal her, Zhou Xiaochuan wanted Ah Fa’s antidote for certainty.

"Impossible. If my calculations hold, the medicine has fully integrated with her body. Removal is futile." Ah Fa sneered.

Zhou Xiaochuan kicked him viciously. If his granddaughter came to harm, he’d tear the man limb from limb.

"You’ll be disappointed. I can cure her," Guan Yu stated.

"Disappointed? You’re the deluded one!" The man wiped blood from his lips. "The medicine and her body are fused like stem and root. Uproot one, and the other dies."

"Damn it!" Even Guan Yu lost composure, ruthlessly activating the insect until the man’s screams died to whimpers. Whether true or not, Guan Yu thanked fate he hadn’t forcibly treated Zhou Xiaoyou—it would’ve killed her.

After dousing the sweat-drenched man with water, Guan Yu demanded, "What is this medicine? Who are you?"

With no extraction possible, the root cause must be addressed.

Ah Fa complied fully this time. The Qi-Gathering Pill condensed heaven-earth spiritual energy. Ordinary humans consuming it could achieve Three Blossoms Converging, becoming cultivators like him—agile and mighty. Cultivators, akin to myths, could soar on clouds and wield magical artifacts. Guan Yu, with his preternatural strength and wall-scaling prowess, qualified as a half-cultivator.

"So this pill is priceless? And cultivators are real?"

"Naturally. The Qi-Gathering Pill initiates mortal transcendence. My own came from a wolf—a flawed version. Had Miss Zhou’s succeeded, she’d gain twenty years of life..." Regret tinged his voice—he’d secretly planted the seed to claim the perfected pill, circumventing his organization.

"How many have you killed this way?"

Guan Yu glanced at Zhou Xiaochuan, whose stoic reaction puzzled him. Such fantastical claims should shock any ordinary person.

"None. This method came from an ancient text. With heaven-earth energy diminished, cauldrons must be human—nature’s densest spiritual vessels..." Ah Fa explained. The tome described cultivators flourishing in ancient dynasties before vanishing. Modern energy scarcity demanded human cauldrons, though the process risked death or dementia. After testing on a wolf king, Ah Fa targeted Zhou Xiaoyou through her pliable cousin.

"Zhou Xiaofeng that idiot aided this!"

Guan Yu pressed, "Does the text mention antidotes? Speak truth, or suffer more."

"None! Separation is impossible once fused."

"Could your organization know?"

Ah Fa, a peripheral member, had only gained status through the tome. After confiscating the book and extracting organizational details, Guan Yu and Zhou Xiaochuan departed.

**Chapter 1103: Heart Movement Realm**

Outside, Zhou Xiaochuan addressed Guan Yu’s unspoken question. "You wonder why I wasn’t shocked? Nations study secrets—America’s Area 51, China’s investigations into supernaturals. Your abilities were noted long ago."

"My powers... known?" Guan Yu paled. He’d thought himself discreet.

"They observed without intervening, deeming you non-threatening. Stay lawful, and you’ll remain unharmed. Our nation’s covert units recruit talents like you. Cultivators exist too, though none confirmed yet."

Guan Yu’s mind raced—how to evade surveillance?

"Don’t fret. They’ll approach you eventually. Comply when they do."

Nodding grimly, Guan Yu shifted focus. With two weeks until Zhou Xiaoyou’s pill matured, he’d raid Ah Fa’s desert-based organization.

At the Wen residence, Guan Yu examined the tattered *Cultivation Compendium*. Cultivation stages spanned Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Meridian Fusion, Heart Movement, Spirit Stillness, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Projection, Spirit Division, Unity, Tribulation, and Ascension. Shockingly, Guan Yu ranked at Heart Movement—a prodigy in this energy-starved era, surpassing Ah Fa’s Foundation Establishment and the organization leader’s Meridian Fusion.

The text detailed spells like Earth-Shortening Step, enabling hundred-mile treks. Alchemy and artifact-forging sections demanded excessive resources. By dawn, Guan Yu mastered the essentials.

After breakfast with Wen Qing and others, he returned to the Zhous.

"I’ve grasped cultivation basics. We depart for the desert this afternoon."

Zhou Xiaochuan arranged military transport. At the airport, Guan Yu bid farewell to his lovers—Liu Shilei’s concern, Mo Ling’s teasing threat, Zhao Jing’er’s longing.

"Behave in Beijing!" they chorused before boarding.

Alone, Guan Yu vowed, "I’ll protect you all."

**Chapter 1104: Clear Breeze Sect**

The western desert’s scorching sands greeted Guan Yu. "Cultivators choosing this wasteland? Madness..."

Ah Fa’s directions led toward central oases. Hours later, a sapphire lake shimmered beyond dunes. As Guan Yu rushed toward it, a voice thundered:

"Who dares trespass forbidden grounds?"
