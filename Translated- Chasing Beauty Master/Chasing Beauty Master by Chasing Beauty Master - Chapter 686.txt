The snowflakes drifting and swirling in the air covered only the area around Mount Fuji. These large, exquisite snowflakes descended leisurely, blanketing the mountain’s peak like a delicate bridal veil draped over a beautiful maiden.

What made this phenomenon even more peculiar was that despite the snowfall, the temperature around Mount Fuji remained mild. Thus, on that day, crowds clad in short sleeves marveled at the snow-clad scenery.

It is said that even countless years later, the snow of Mount Fuji remained the most breathtaking in the world. Legends claimed that those who scooped a handful of its snow to brew tea would find all ailments cured. Over time, Mount Fuji’s snow became a highly sought-after commodity.

As people admired the wondrous spectacle, they failed to notice three figures who had quietly vanished from the skies above. From that day forth, these celestial beings were never seen again.

The battle between Ito and Guan Yu had taken place thousands of meters above the ground. Even with telescopes, no one discerned their features, leaving the world unaware that these so-called “immortals” were none other than them.

**Chapter 1743: Preparing for the Rain Before the Clouds**

Guan Yu returned with Ito and Sakurako to his hotel in Hakodate. Having resolved the hidden dangers in Ito’s cultivation of fire-attribute spiritual energy, Guan Yu no longer needed to train within Mount Fuji.

When Ito inquired about his next move, Guan Yu revealed his plan to return to China. He intended to revisit the site where he had first entered the Demon Tower. The soldiers stationed there had warned him of mutated beasts in the surrounding forests—creatures grown terrifyingly powerful. If these beasts were to rampage, disastrous consequences might follow.

Ito nodded. As the War God of the Eastern Islands, he could not leave his post lightly. Still, he assured Guan Yu that should the need arise, he would seek the Divine Emperor’s permission to aid him.

Though tempted to disclose the matter of the Five Extremes to Ito, Guan Yu ultimately refrained. It wasn’t distrust but a desire to keep the knowledge confined, avoiding panic among the populace.

Sakurako longed to accompany Guan Yu to China, but her duties as a police officer required her to resign formally before joining him.

**Chapter 1744: Hayakawa Seeks a Master**

The next morning, Guan Yu flew back to China.

Ouyang Zhengdong was overjoyed to see the weapons retrieved from the Eastern Islands. With the Ouyang family now part of Universal Group, military pressure had eased, and resolving this matter swiftly was ideal.

They were received by an old acquaintance—Commander He Wu.

“Guan Yu, you truly retrieved those weapons! Rumor says you and War God Ito had an epic duel atop Mount Fuji. Our satellites captured the footage—a tremendous boost for our nation’s morale!”

Ouyang Zhengdong, unaware of the battle, felt a surge of gratitude. Guan Yu had risked much for his family. Had the Eastern Islands resorted to extreme measures, even Guan Yu’s prowess might not have ensured his safety.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Commander He, ‘boosting morale’ seems excessive. Footage of our battle can’t be publicly released. Besides, I hear Eastern Islanders believe their gods were fighting, restoring their national pride.”

He Wu smiled mysteriously. “The Eastern Islands and China share millennia of history. With clever rhetoric, any narrative can inspire. Though global cooperation against interplanetary threats is the trend, strength remains paramount. Our principle is clear: whatever form the conflict with other realms takes, China must hold the initiative.”

Guan Yu, though familiar with such political calculations, chose not to dwell on them. Even as chairman of Universal Group—a title Du Xiaojuan had bestowed—he chafed at corporate routine. His recent escape to the Eastern Islands had been an attempt to evade the mundane life she envisioned.

Men and women dreamed differently. Du Xiaojuan yearned for quiet normality, while Guan Yu thrived on danger. As a warrior who had glimpsed higher realms within the Demon Tower, he aspired to transcendent power.

Though he didn’t share Commander He’s priorities, Guan Yu understood them. China was his homeland to protect, while nations like the Eastern Islands posed no true threat.

“Commander He, the Divine Emperor has shown sincerity. As long as the Demon Tower exists, global unity is inevitable. Even if we destroy it, all sides will be weakened—conflict becomes unlikely,” Guan Yu remarked.

He Wu sighed, offering a cigar Guan Yu declined. “We leaders know this. Expelling those interplanetary beings might leave Earth vulnerable—if we even succeed. Yet we cannot afford complacency. Millions under my command, billions relying on us—we must plan for every contingency. Civilians may err and recover, but our mistakes doom nations.”

Guan Yu nodded. He Wu was right—his own perspective was too self-centered. Those bearing the weight of billions deserved deeper consideration.

In essence, Guan Yu was a warrior, not a strategist—suited for battlefields, not boardrooms.

As their conversation continued, Ouyang Zhengdong remained silent, overshadowed by their stature.

He Wu urged Guan Yu to embrace his responsibility as Earth’s strongest—the fate of billions might rest on his shoulders.

Guan Yu laughed it off, but He Wu pressed, “Do you truly doubt it?”

After a long pause, Guan Yu thought of the Demon Tower’s mysteries. Who had sent it? Why Earth? Answers eluded him.

**Chapter 1745: Journey to the Arctic**

Emerging from his reverie, Guan Yu sipped tea from He Wu’s desk. “Speak plainly, Commander.”

He Wu seized the opening. “With great power comes great responsibility. As Earth’s mightiest, shouldn’t your duty match?”

Guan Yu grinned. “By your logic, I should… well, you understand.”

He Wu studied him, gauging sincerity, then relaxed. “You’re jesting, brother.”

Their banter belied grave stakes—Guan Yu’s loyalty was pivotal.

Ouyang Zhengdong stayed mute; the matters dwarfed his role.

Guan Yu grew earnest. “Cultivators seek transcendence—breaking boundaries, exploring infinity. Earthly glory fades. I remain here for loved ones and the looming crisis. Once resolved, I’ll pursue higher realms.”

After discussions with Ito, Guan Yu pondered the cosmos’ layers. The Demon Tower seemed a vessel—from where? What lay beyond?

He Wu exhaled relief, echoing his superiors’ unspoken concerns. None could control Guan Yu, hence their cautious respect.

“We’ve reports of mutated polar bears near an Arctic relic. They slaughter all approaching humans—even bone fragments vanish. Several American nations sent subjects for mutation experiments, but dozens perished recently. Could you investigate?”

Though phrased as a request, Guan Yu intended to go regardless.

He withheld mention of the Illusory Heaven Pearl—the fewer aware, the better. Would extracting the Five Extremes harm Earth? Uncertainty stayed his tongue.

After parting, Guan Yu returned home. Du Xiaojuan, irked by his avoidance of corporate duties, eventually relented. His Eastern Islands escapade had reignited his craving for freedom.

Hou Jinshun rushed to greet him, transformed from a rogue to a dignified disciple. Though lax in practicing the combat techniques Guan Yu imparted, his newfound vigor shone.

The next afternoon, Sakurako called—she and Hayakawa Shigeru had landed in Beijing.

Hayakawa knelt immediately, kowtowing thrice. “Master, accept me as your disciple!”

Guan Yu sighed. “Must you mimic outdated rituals?”

Hayakawa blinked. “Your films all show this! I’ll kneel until you agree!”

Sakurako vouched for his sincerity. “He’s earnest, Guan Yu. Take him.”

Guan Yu sensed potential in the once-arrogant youth who’d gracefully conceded defeat and sublimated his affection for Sakurako into camaraderie. Hayakawa’s thirst for power eclipsed all—had he not met Guan Yu, he might’ve sought Ito’s tutelage.

But witnessing Guan Yu’s duel with Ito had sealed his resolve. Guan Yu intuited Hayakawa’s future greatness, surpassing even Ito’s limits.

Thus, Hayakawa became his first true disciple—Hou Jinshun remained a follower.

As Sakurako and Hayakawa settled into Guan Yu’s spacious villa, life quieted. The Shadow Society lay dormant, eluding Dragon Group’s searches. Guan Yu, refusing corporate chains, wandered free—until Commander He’s Arctic plea beckoned.

The world’s fate, again, rested on his shoulders.
