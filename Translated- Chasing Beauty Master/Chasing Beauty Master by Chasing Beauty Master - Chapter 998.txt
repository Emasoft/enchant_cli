Guan Yu smiled. “Whether I’m sincere depends on whether you believe me. If you distrust me, nothing I say will convince you. Besides, can you even produce ten million right now? Spare us this pointless bickering.”

Fang Su wasn’t surprised by Guan Yu’s attitude. If negotiations failed, force remained. Tonight, he would teach this insolent fool a bloody lesson.

Though the girl beside Guan Yu seemed formidable, Fang Su calculated that a few high-level cultivators could keep her occupied while the rest dealt with the rabble. Victory was assured.

“Guan Yu,” Fang Su said darkly, oozing false magnanimity, “you’ve seen my men. If this turns violent, you stand no chance. Hand over the recording, and I’ll spare everyone here. Otherwise, they’ll all be hospitalized by dawn.”

Guan Yu remained unperturbed, his expression lazily dismissive. Fear had long abandoned him—no threat could rattle him now.

“If you’re so confident, try your luck,” Guan Yu retorted, eyes glinting. “But be warned: starting a fight here might cost you dearly.” Money fueled his gang’s growth—every coin extracted from fools like Fang Su would strengthen his faction. Wealth attracted recruits, even cultivators. With enough resources, his influence would soar.

Though now an ordinary man reliant on Xue Jing’s protection and a concealed pistol, Guan Yu’s web of enemies demanded such precautions.

“You’ll regret your stubbornness!” Fang Su snapped. Turning to his subordinates, he barked, “Send our best to restrain that girl. The rest—beat them senseless! Capture Guan Yu alive!”

Smug certainty warmed Fang Su’s veins. His sister Fang Ding had warned that Guan Yu was untouchable, a phantom no one could grasp. Yet here he stood, moments from seizing the man. Afterward, he’d boast to his cronies about humiliating Guan Yu, parading him through the streets as a warning to all who opposed the Fang family. His father’s illness would surely improve once this thorn was removed. So many benefits awaited—Fang Su’s lips curled as visions of triumph danced before him.

“Attack!”

Weapons flashed as cultivators surged forward. Fang Su slithered toward the warehouse entrance, positioning himself for a swift escape if needed.

Xue Jing moved first. Channeling her inner energy, she hurled razor-sharp projectiles that streaked toward the attackers. From his vantage point, Fang Su paled—this “insignificant girl” wielded terrifying power.

Before he could react, an invisible force lifted him airborne. Agony exploded in his lower back—a sledgehammer blow crushing his spine. Screaming, he hurtled toward the battlefield until Xue Jing materialized before him, malice twisting her features.

Dangling upside-down, Fang Su’s face rushed toward concrete. Xue Jing’s boot met his nose with a sickening crunch.

Fang Su collapsed at the warehouse threshold, unconscious and unrecognizable—nose shattered, face a bloody mask. The combatants froze at the thud, gaping at their employer’s mangled form.

Xue Jing smirked. This was retribution for his “old hag” insult. Normally, such offenders died. Today, mercy meant lingering humiliation.

As silence fell, a figure materialized beside Guan Yu—Jinciyu Lang, the wolf-like warrior. Guan Yu had discreetly summoned him earlier, buying time with verbal sparring.

Though Fang Su lay defeated, his mercenaries hesitated. Their pay depended on capturing Guan Yu. “Charge!” one shouted. “Take him!”

Jinciyu Lang drew his crimson blade. A single sweeping strike unleashed a scarlet wave that felled a dozen men—severed limbs littered the ground. The survivors froze, weapons trembling.

“Move again,” the warrior growled, “and I sever heads.” His accented Chinese carried finality.

Guan Yu surveyed the carnage, envy flickering beneath his calm. If only his sealed memories and power would return! For now, he played the strategist. “Leave,” he commanded the stunned mercenaries. “Or join your comrades on the ground.”

They fled, dragging wounded allies. Xue Jing barked, “Take every last worm with you!” Within minutes, only Fang Su’s broken body remained.

“Check if he’s alive,” Guan Yu ordered. Jia Bo confirmed the heir still breathed, though his face resembled crushed fruit.

“Call an ambulance,” Guan Yu sighed, shooting Xue Jing a reproachful look. “You ruined my payday. He’s a civilian—you nearly killed him.”

“He’s lucky I held back,” Xue Jing sniffed. Gang members exchanged awed glances—their boss’s woman radiated deadlier aura than Guan Yu himself.

Jinciyu Lang cleared his throat. “My payment...”

Guan Yu feigned ignorance until the warrior mentioned “family discounts.” Xue Jing suppressed laughter as Guan Yu threatened to call Jinciyu Lang’s beloved sister Yingzi. The warrior capitulated instantly—no fee required between “family.”

After Jinciyu Lang departed, Guan Yu murmured, “Pity. I’d hoped to squeeze Fang Su dry.” He glanced at Xue Jing. “Next time, leave their wallets intact before breaking bones.”

Jia Bo scurried to obey, while Guan Yu contemplated future schemes. Power came in many forms—sometimes, a sister’s influence outweighed even a warrior’s blade.
