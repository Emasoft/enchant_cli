“Guan Yu nearly burst out laughing. If he couldn’t act openly, couldn’t he scheme in the shadows? With his gravity system, controlling a small pebble over such a short distance was child’s play!

“Alright, wifey, let’s ignore him. Let him howl here all he wants!”

The group paid no heed to Li Bing’s venomous glare and turned to enter the club.

“Sir, please present your membership pass!” A burly man in black blocked Guan Yu’s path at the entrance.

Membership pass? Guan Yu paused. He’d been invited by Hu Zongze—since when did he need a pass? Realization struck: this was another of Hu’s petty ploys.

Hmph! You think such a trifling trick can stump me?

Guan Yu sneered coldly at the guard. “Tell Hu Zongze that if this is the best he can manage, I’ve no interest in his pathetic party!”

He turned to leave, but the guard called out, “Sir, wait! Let me consult my superiors—”

“You have ten seconds.” Guan Yu had no patience to linger like a fool. This frivolous event bored him anyway.

The guard hurriedly relayed the message via earpiece. Moments later, he returned bowing. “Sir, the Chairman says you’re honored guests exempt from membership requirements. Please enter!”

Honored guests? Oh, we’re honored indeed!

Guan Yu smirked sardonically, flipping off the security camera above the door.

In the surveillance room, Hu Zongze slammed his fist on the desk. “Damn you, Guan Yu! Let’s see how smug you’ll be later!”

“Zongze, is that the Guan Yu who dismantled Haomen, humiliated Li Bing, and slighted the Song family?” An elderly man beside him inquired.

“Yes, Grandfather Wang. That’s him.” Hu Zongze’s tone held deference.

“Interesting lad,” the old man remarked tonelessly, his face impassive. “Has Old Wen really approved his relationship with that granddaughter of his?”

At the mention of Wen Qing, Hu Zongze’s eyes flashed. “Yes. Grandfather Wen seems... satisfied with Guan Yu.”

“Zongze, great men aren’t shackled by sentiment! Have you forgotten the General’s teachings?”

**Chapter One Thousand and Four: Reunion with Hu Zongze**

“But... Grandfather Wang, I truly love Wen Qing.” Hu Zongze’s voice wavered. They’d been childhood companions—his feelings weren’t so easily discarded.

“If you cherish her, strengthen yourself! Old Wen, like the General, respects capability. Prove your worth, or you’ll never win his approval!”

The elder’s words struck a chord. Hu Zongze straightened. “Understood, Grandfather Wang.”

Were Guan Yu merely a romantic rival, Hu could crush him effortlessly. But Guan’s meteoric rise had captured even Grandfather Wang’s attention. With other Hu heirs circling like vultures, failure here could cost Hu Zongze his inheritance.

“This so-called elite club looks mediocre.” Guan Yu surveyed the wood-paneled interiors disdainfully. “Our home’s better decorated.”

Wen Qing and Lin Lin chuckled while Lin Dong rolled his eyes. “If it used gaudy marble like common venues, it wouldn’t be Kyoto’s premier club.”

“Exactly!” Lin Lin pointed excitedly. “See that table? Fifty-year-old snow pearwood. Those chairs—sandalwood! And that screen! Heavenly cedar! The extravagance!”

Guan Yu huffed, “Pricey lumber’s still just wood. Won’t stop men from turning beasts around women!”

Lin Dong ignored the jab, scrutinizing the surroundings with a killer’s precision. “Over fifty cameras monitoring every move. Armed ex-military guards—eight on left, five right, four ahead. The honorary chairman’s influence is... impressive.”

Lin Lin whispered conspiratorially, “They say the chairman’s a kingmaker destined for the apex.”

Guan Yu scoffed, “If destinies were certain, where’s the fun? Besides—” He smirked at Lin Dong. “There’re sixty-one cameras, genius. See those stairs? Two guards there could floor me blindfolded. You’ve got ways to go, rookie.”

Lin Dong’s eye twitched. How he longed to punch that smug face.

——

“Qing’er! You came!” Hu Zongze approached, hunger flashing as he admired Wen Qing’s radiance.

“Zongze-ge.” She shifted uncomfortably. Only childhood ties had drawn her here.

“Ah, Brother Guan! And this gentleman is...?” Hu feigned noticing the others.

Guan Yu ignored him, whining to Wen Qing, “Wifey, I’m starving! Feed me?”

With an apologetic glance at Hu, she let Guan Yu lead her away. Lin Dong didn’t spare Hu a look.

Burning with fury, Hu Zongze clenched his fists. “Enjoy your arrogance, Guan Yu. Tonight will be your reckoning.”

——

“Who’s that cocky bastard?” asked Zhou Kang, one of Hu’s lackeys.

“Guan Yu. The upstart who crushed Haomen and slapped Song faces.”

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. In Kyoto’s elite circles, Guan Yu was legend—feared, hated, or seen as a stepping stone for ambition.

Zhou Kang’s eyes gleamed. Here was his chance to shine. “Let me teach him manners, Zongze!”

Hu pretended reluctance. “He’s dangerous...”

“Dangerous? In Kyoto, dragons crawl before us! Leave it to me!”

——

Unaware of the brewing storm, Guan Yu pestered Wen Qing by the dessert table. “C’mon, feed me!”

“But everyone’s watching!”

“So? You’re my wife!”

Blushing, she finally relented, passing him cake mouth-to-mouth. Lin Lin promptly mimicked them, reducing stoic Lin Dong to scarlet embarrassment.

Their laughter died as Zhou Kang swaggered over. “So you’re Guan Yu? Rutting in public like animals—want us to watch?”

His cronies leered at Wen Qing.

Guan Yu glanced up lazily. “For live shows, catch your mom and dad’s reruns.”

Silence. Then Zhou Kang roared, “You fucking找死!”

“Yes, I’m找死. Dare kill me?” Guan Yu taunted. “Amateur.”

Enraged, Zhou lunged—only for guards to tackle him. Guan Yu yelled, “Help! Assault!”

Hu Zongze rushed over, pleading with the head guard: “He didn’t actually hit anyone!”

Guan Yu mocked, “So much for club integrity! All bark, no bite.”

Hu turned to Wen Qing, “How can you date this riffraff?”

She smiled sweetly. “He’s my husband first, a riffraff second.”

Guan Yu planted a loud kiss on her cheek. Hu’s face purpled.

——

Expelled and disgraced, Zhou Kang realized too late: he’d gambled his family standing—and lost.

**Chapter One Thousand and Five: Guan Yu the Rogue**

As Guan Yu reveled with Wen Qing, Li Xi watched from the shadows, conflicted. She’d postponed her Taiwan plans to publicly back him after yesterday’s chaos.

**Chapter One Thousand and Six: The Ball Begins**

When the music swelled, Hu Zongze ascended the stage, mask of courtesy intact. But his eyes promised vengeance. The real game was just beginning.
