The observant Guan Yu naturally noticed this, thinking: This person seems decent! Might as well save his life! Immediately harnessing wind elements to follow, Murong Fengyu tensely watched the horde of demons before him. Though powerful, even he couldn't withstand their relentless onslaught. The demons stared hungrily at their impending feast!

Just as battle was about to commence, a cold voice suddenly rang out.

"Cease!"

All turned toward the sound. Two figures stood beyond the encirclement—a middle-aged man in black martial attire and a red-haired, crimson-eyed girl with a vermilion whip at her waist! Murong Fengyu examined Wuxue with surprise, marveling at her courage. Even he tread carefully around these demons, yet she showed no fear! This earned his admiration. He opened his mouth to warn her away, but the words died as he witnessed an astonishing scene.

The demons instantly parted, bowing respectfully as they chorused:

"Lord Asura!" Terror filled their eyes. Murong Fengyu noted everything, inwardly pondering: Why would these demons fear a ten-year-old child?

Guan Yu approached him calmly. "Follow me." She turned and left. Though uncertain of her intentions, Murong Fengyu sensed no malice and followed.

The demons stirred restlessly as their prey retreated. One finally lunged with an attack. As Murong Fengyu prepared to counter, a crimson whip snapped through the air. With a resounding crack, both attack and demon were bisected midair. The remaining demons swallowed hard, grateful for their restraint. Murong Fengyu marveled: How ruthless! Now I understand their fear.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu continued walking indifferently. Soon, the bisected demon's bones were picked clean. Murong Fengyu frowned, wondering: Where in blazes are we?

Suddenly, Wuxue halted.

"You may leave."

Murong Fengyu was perplexed. Being rescued for no reason then dismissed? Nothing in this world comes free!

Guan Yu seemed to read his thoughts. "You're a good person." Realizing she'd saved him due to his earlier kindness, Murong Fengyu's regard for her grew.

"Ahem, if I may—where is this place?" He smiled at Guan Yu.

"The Abyss of Death," she replied flatly before departing.

Watching her receding figure, Murong Fengyu mused: "An intriguing child! The sealed Abyss of Death? How unlucky to be teleported here! Well, let's see if I survive a month." As Guan Yu wandered the forest with Hei Jiaolong, she learned this was merely the outer city. "Demon City?" She gazed eastward, murmuring: Perhaps the exit lies there.

Returning to the swamp, Hei Jiaolong submerged while Guan Yu remained alone. Wuxue stood atop a hollow tree, staring east toward Demon City. Four years... Father, Mother, Elder Sister, Brother—have you all changed? Guan Yu has.

As she prepared to meditate, a white-clad figure came sprinting—pursued by demons! Wuxue coldly observed without intervening. She claimed no virtue, for "virtue dies young while vice thrives millennia."

The man collapsed by the swamp. His hunters dared not approach, frozen under the red-clad girl's glare. With a single hissed "Begone!", they scattered resentfully. Approaching the unconscious man, Wuxue gasped: "Him!"

It was the human Guan Yu encountered earlier. His injuries were grave. Using wind elements, she levitated him into the tree hollow's sole stone bed. Frowning at his blood-crusted wounds, she...

...summoned water elements in her left hand, dousing him. Murong Fengyu jolted awake, expecting capture—only to see crimson robes.

"Awake?" Guan Yu stated as he stirred.

'Thanks to your rude awakening,' he thought wryly. Before he could speak, she cut in: "Tend your wounds." Filling a wooden basin via water elements, she exited.

Murong Fengyu stared at his soaked clothes. Must water espers be so literal? Still, intuition whispered safety here. Who was this girl? Questions could wait—wounds first.

Surveying his injuries, he grimaced. Even elephants fall to enough ants! To be cornered by weaker demons... Shameful!

Guan Yu sat alone by the swamp, gazing skyward. Returning later, she found the handsome elder meditating. Without word, she channeled light elements into him. Warmth flooded his dantian, mending meridians. Hours later, sweat-drenched Wuxue collapsed toward him. Murong caught her gratefully—his injuries half-healed through her efforts.

Unbeknownst to him, she'd used rare light elements, not water.

As Murong laid her down, a figure stormed in attacking. "Darkwater Blade!" Obsidian blades flew. Dodging reflexively, Murong tried explaining but received only relentless assaults. Guan Yu's crimson eyes watched intently.

The attacker—Hei Jiaolong—raged: "Vile human! She saves you, yet you harm her? Die! Demonic Surge!" Water elements converged. Murong countered: "Inferno Blaze!" Steam erupted. Hei Jiaolong cursed the elemental disadvantage but acknowledged Murong's strength.

"Friend, this is misunderstanding!" Murong pleaded.

"No malice? Then why is she wounded?"

"By saving me!"

Hei Jiaolong glanced at Guan Yu's nod, then awkwardly apologized. The two men's clash bred camaraderie, soon chatting amiably.

Later, Murong inquired about Guan Yu. Hei Jiaolong sighed: "She came four years ago..." As her past unfolded, Murong felt profound shock—and protective urges, though he knew she'd reject them.

Gazing skyward, he anticipated her growth. She wouldn't stay here forever.

On the swamp, red and black figures clashed—sparks flying as elements collided. The smaller red form struggled until knocked down. Guan Yu rose unsteadily, declaring: "I'll surpass you!" before leaving. Murong sighed. Daily challenges despite the gap—her unyielding spirit impressed yet worried him. Such stubbornness might bring future hardship.

Hei Jiaolong shook his head wryly. Night fell, indistinguishable in the Abyssal gloom.

A deep voice suddenly boomed: "Sha'en requests audience with the Asura King!"

All stirred. Hei Jiaolong went to investigate while the others resumed cultivation. "State your business." The demon visitor trembled before the black dragon. "Sha'en brings urgent matters!"

Four years prior had etched terror of Guan Yu—the true Asura—into demonkind. Hei Jiaolong hesitated, but Guan Yu's icy voice decided: "Admit him."

Sha'en entered trembling. "Great Asura King! Strange phenomena occurred westwards. We humbly request your presence to investigate treasures!"

A cold snort preceded a whip at his throat. Hei Jiaolong accused: "You plot to ambush us!"

Sha'en collapsed, denying frantically. Murong watched thoughtfully: My disciple's wisdom shines again.

Indeed, western woods hid ambushers. Recent disturbances from Demon City had lower demons desperate—either offer sacrifices or become food themselves. Though strong, Guan Yu's group couldn't match Demon City's denizens.

As Sha'en tried fleeing, Guan Yu's Soul-Devouring Whip immobilized him, blood draining until unconsciousness.

"What's happening here?" Murong pressed. The demons' overridden fear suggested extraordinary circumstances. "Try that soul-reading magic I taught you."

Nodding, Guan Yu placed a hand on Sha'en's head. "Demonic Arts—Soul Harvest!" The victim convulsed as memories were extracted.

Guan Yu's eyes widened. "Demon City...and Chimera." While familiar with the former, 'Chimera' perplexed all.

Hei Jiaolong paled. "Even Demon City's lords emerge? What could tempt them so?"

Though unclear, Murong grasped the severity. Hei Jiaolong departed westward to investigate, leaving instructions. Murong executed Sha'en and returned, finding Guan Yu cultivating intensely—her prowess explained by relentless training. Genius honed through endless effort.

Unbeknownst to him, this parting became permanent. Hei Jiaolong soared over western forests, seeking answers. Below, demons lurked in ambush. A black whirlwind descended—containing a humanoid demon exuding terrifying aura. The demons cowered as he demanded: "Where are they?"

A lizard-demon stammered: "N-not arrived..."

Cold hands snapped its neck. The lord devoured its still-beating heart, drawing horrified gasps. Hei Jiaolong hid, chilled by the cruelty rivaling Guan Yu's—but lacking her restraint.

"Who spies?!" The demon-lord detected him. A chase ensued—wind versus water. Cornered, Hei Jiaolong faced his hunter: a wind esper demon-lord of terrifying speed...
