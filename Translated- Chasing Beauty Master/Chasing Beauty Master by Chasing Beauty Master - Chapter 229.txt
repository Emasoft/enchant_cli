In the eyes of their classmates, the whole affair seemed like "much thunder but little rain." Initially, they feared Guan Yu might be expelled, with some considering petitioning the principal to keep him and others mobilizing family connections to ensure he stayed.

After Wang Zhen explained the sudden exam situation, they realized Guan Yu had kicked the Academic Dean for their collective benefit—a selfless, noble sacrifice. No matter what, they couldn’t let their hero leave school.

As hoped, Guan Yu remained at school without even receiving disciplinary action.

Overjoyed, they speculated about who had secured his stay. Many theories circulated, but Wang Zhen alone knew the truth.

As for Liu Gang, surveillance footage proved Guan Yu’s account: Liu Gang had groped him relentlessly before Guan Yu snapped. Exposing this would tarnish the school’s reputation. After negotiations with the principal, Guan Yu agreed not to release the video, leaving Liu Gang solely accountable.

Liu Gang remained as Academic Dean—now demoted to deputy. Bitter and bruised, he lamented his punishment. Worse, his brother-in-law had been transferred to traffic control as a low-level officer, toiling under the sun. His sister quarreled with him, straining family relations.

In his clash with Guan Yu, Liu Gang had suffered utter defeat. His current misery was entirely Guan Yu’s doing, fueling his hatred.

Zheng Tian explained that the “Director Nie” from that day was the police chief. Liu Gang realized that without Guan Yu’s intervention, Director Nie would have dealt with him harshly. Though aware of Guan Yu’s police connections, Liu Gang’s background checks still painted him as a poor rural boy with no ties to power—contradicting Zheng Tian’s claims.

This confirmation only deepened Liu Gang’s resentment. Vengeance festered in his heart.

As long as Guan Yu remained at school, Liu Gang would find ways to target him. “So what if he’s close to the police chief? He’s not the education director. A few minor tricks won’t land me in jail.” With this reasoning, his lingering caution vanished.

After reflecting at home, Liu Gang realized Guan Yu had trapped him. The pivotal moment was Guan Yu finishing the exam in ten minutes—a step Liu Gang still refused to believe. He assumed Guan Yu had scribbled nonsense to bait him.

Liu Gang took solace in thinking the grading teacher had pitied Guan Yu by awarding five points. “If he fails one more subject, expulsion is inevitable. No one can dispute that.” He resolved to make the upcoming English exam Guan Yu’s last.

Imagining Guan Yu’s downfall lifted his mood. Smiling, he entered the faculty office—the day exam results were posted. He eagerly anticipated seeing Guan Yu’s “zero,” hoping for schadenfreude.

Instead, he found teachers huddled in shock. Irked by their gossip during work hours, he barked, “What’s the meaning of gathering like this? Disperse at once!”

Teachers scattered but continued murmuring. Liu Gang approached Chen Ming’s desk.

“Professor Chen, are Performance Arts Class One’s math scores ready?”

“They’re… unusual,” Chen Ming replied meaningfully. “In all my years, I’ve never seen such results.”

Liu Gang’s heart leapt—he assumed mass failures. “How many must retake?”

Chen Ming frowned. “You misunderstand. Their scores aren’t low—they’re perfect. The entire class scored 100.”

A soldier who doesn’t aspire to be a general isn’t a good soldier; a teacher who doesn’t seek excellence isn’t a good teacher.

Twists and turns, where shadows part to reveal light.

Liu Gang’s emotions had rollercoastered. Emerging disappointed from the office earlier, he’d hoped Chen Ming would expose Guan Yu’s cheating—but instead plunged into despair.

Now, an anonymous text reignited his hopes: *“I’m from Arts Class One. I can prove they cheated. They’re planning to cheat in English too. Meet me at XX Café.”*

Trusting the source—which had correctly warned of the math exam scheme—Liu Gang headed to the café. Without evidence, he’d been powerless, but this tip promised a chance to catch Guan Yu red-handed.

In a VIP suite of Luo Cheng’s five-star hotel, Guan Yu, Niu Le, Wang Zhen, Tian Hao, core male members like Zhu Lin, and key contributor Zhao Jing’er celebrated their class’s perfect scores. Dubbed the “Greatest Class in History,” their feat had earned school-wide acclaim and rewards for Chen Ming.

“A toast to Brother Yu and Sister Jing’er!” Wang Zhen raised his glass. “For sacrificing so much for us!”

Others joined, including Niu Le—absent from the exam but present to “liven the mood and play matchmaker.”

Guan Yu sipped politely while Zhao Jing’er blushed at the teasing. “Enough,” Guan Yu chided. “Jing’er’s shy. There’s nothing between us.”

The group exchanged knowing smirks.

Wang Zhen chuckled. “You should’ve seen Liu Gang’s face—like he’d caught his wife cheating! Pure catharsis.”

“Forced to swallow his pride,” Tian Hao added faux-sympathetically.

Laughter erupted.

Niu Le, excluded from the scheme, growled, “Next exam, I’ll see this ‘Academic Dean’ myself. Let’s just beat him senseless!”

Wang Zhen rolled his eyes. “Violence is temporary. Outsmarting him under his nose—that’s the real victory. Like Tom and Jerry: the mouse taunts, but the cat can’t catch it. That’s why Liu Gang’s been fuming all week.”

As the rowdy trio wrestled, Guan Yu smiled. Later, over tea, Wang Zhen broached the elephant in the room: “Brother Yu, why wait to expose the traitor?”

“Patience,” Guan Yu said. “After the English exam, they’ll surface on their own.”

Wang Zhen’s eyes lit up. “You know who it is?”

“Mostly. Just need confirmation.”

“When we find them,” Tian Hao snarled, “I’ll break their legs!”

“Leave the third leg to me!” Niu Le added.

Guan Yu laughed. “What if it’s a woman?”

Niu Le paused. “Then I’ll… adjust her bones. A woman that vile deserves it.”

Wang Zhen eyed Guan Yu. “You leaked info to lure them out, didn’t you?”

Brothers bond through shared trials—though Guan Yu hadn’t “shared” all their exploits.

Watching the trio’s antics, Guan Yu sipped tea, savoring the calm. But Wang Zhen’s mind churned.

“Brother Yu, why delay finding the mole?” he pressed.

“Timing. After English, they’ll reveal themselves.”

Wang Zhen seethed. “When we catch them, I’ll make them regret existing!”

Tian Hao nodded. “I’ll handle the legs.”

“Third leg’s mine!” Niu Le interjected.

Guan Yu smirked. “What if it’s a girl?”

Niu Le shrugged. “Even a snake-hearted woman needs… correction.”

Silence fell as Guan Yu drank, his plan unfolding.
