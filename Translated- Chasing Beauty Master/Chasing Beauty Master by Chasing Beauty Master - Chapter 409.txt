When leaving the club, Wen Qing clung to Guan Yu's arm. Though Mu Xiyan didn't follow suit, she pressed closely against his side, her fragrance persistently invading his nostrils, making him repeatedly glance her way.

Noticing this, Wen Qing snorted coldly and delivered another series of pinches.

This time, Guan Yu didn't cry out in pain—he'd grown numb.

Perhaps due to driving responsibilities, the journey passed without further bickering between Wen Qing and Mu Xiyan. Upon arriving at the Wen residence, Mu Xiyan adopted an expression of grievous injustice, imploring Guan Yu: "Guan Yu, won't you really escort me home?"

Her pitiful demeanor nearly moved Guan Yu to agree. He'd always been defenseless against beauties, especially those openly throwing themselves at him.

However, considering Wen Qing's feelings, he shook his head and hailed a taxi for Mu Xiyan.

"Hmph! Guan Yu, just wait! I've decided—I'll definitely make you mine!" Mu Xiyan declared from the taxi window, shaking her small fist in oath.

"Feeling heartbroken?" Wen Qing asked with jealous bite. Before she could react, a sharp slap landed on her pert bottom, making her yelp and collapse into Guan Yu's arms, gazing at him with wounded eyes.

Guan Yu took a deep breath, suppressing his urge to take the little vixen right there. "My, how bold we've become! Daring to mock your husband! Has it been too long since your last spanking? Feeling neglected?"

"I did no such thing!" Wen Qing protested. "I just can't stand that Mu Xiyan!"

"Oh? Taking out your displeasure on your husband? Just wait—I'll teach you proper manners later!"

Wen Qing batted her dewy peach-blossom eyes, cooing: "Husband~ How do you plan to punish me?"

Boom!

Guan Yu's restraint shattered. His large hand plunged beneath her clothes, roughly kneading her increasingly voluptuous breasts.

As Wen Qing moaned continuously, her attempts to resist melted into helpless tremors. "Not here... husband... not outside..."

"Then where?" Guan Yu grinned wolfishly.

"You beast! To bed!" Wen Qing nibbled his earlobe, hot breath whispering temptation.

Without another word, Guan Yu swept her up and charged toward the house—only to freeze upon entering the living room. Wen Shuquan, Liu Jingguo, Wen Baoguo, and surprisingly Liu Yunjie all sat waiting on the couches.

Wen Baoguo snorted at the sight of Guan Yu carrying his daughter. "Brat! What's your blasted hurry?"

Guan Yu nearly rolled his eyes. Couldn't the man guess?

Liu Jingguo coughed. "Qing'er, retire to your room. We need words with Xiaoyu."

Obediently, Wen Qing slipped from Guan Yu's arms and withdrew.

"Xiaoyu, we've heard about tonight's events," Wen Shuquan began once she'd left. Guan Yu nodded—though the elders hadn't attended, nothing at the Imperial College Club escaped their notice. From Hu Zongze's expulsion to Song Shaoqin's beating and the Eastern family's intervention, every development had rippled through Beijing's upper echelons.

Liu Yunjie's presence here stemmed from his professional connection to Eastern Li, his direct superior.

"Xiaoyu, explain how you became acquainted with Eastern Mu."

Guan Yu recounted their chance meeting in detail. "...Grandfather, we only met once. I don't understand why he aids me. I fear I'll disappoint you."

Chapter 1024: The Father-in-Law Who Wants to Strangle His Son-in-Law

Wen Shuquan waved dismissively. "Disappointment is unnecessary. Eastern Mu never acts without cause—we'll follow the natural course. However, this storm hasn't fully passed."

"Grandfather means the Song family will retaliate?" Guan Yu frowned.

"Do you think thrashing Song Shaoqin concludes matters? His status far surpasses Song Dawei's! When will you learn to think before acting?"

While mothers-in-law traditionally dote on sons-in-law, Wen Baoguo's disdain for Guan Yu only grew. Even knowing his Eastern family connections couldn't sweeten his tone.

Guan Yu habitually ignored the man's barbs—this father-in-law merely resented him for stealing his precious daughter.

But others took offense. Liu Jingguo barked: "What nonsense! If Xiaoyu lacked wit, he wouldn't be standing here unharmed!"

Wen Baoguo swallowed his retort, unwilling to contradict the patriarch.

Liu Jingguo continued: "In my view, you struck too lightly! That whelp secretly amassing forces—planning rebellion? Had I been present, I'd have arrested him instantly!"

Liu Yunjie wiped sweat from his brow. Every prominent family maintained private security—an open secret. But exposing this "rebellion" could indeed warrant arrest, especially under Wen Shuquan's trigger-happy jurisdiction.

"Grandfather, what should I do now?"

Guan Yu abandoned pride—this situation exceeded individual resolution.

"Perhaps I could assist?" Liu Yunjie ventured.

"You?" Liu Jingguo scoffed. "What can a mere Political and Legal Affairs Committee secretary achieve? Wen Baoguo would be more effective!"

Both men wore expressions of chagrin—despite their high positions, they ranked lowest in this room's hierarchy. Meanwhile, Guan Yu inexplicably charmed the patriarchs.

Wen Shuquan interjected: "Actually, Yunjie's suggestion holds merit. Baoguo's intelligence ties make him politically sensitive. As mid-level bureaucracy, Yunjie could exploit the Song family's weak connections to commerce ministries."

The old fox had recognized Liu Yunjie's ambitions upon arrival, now throwing him a lifeline. Liu Yunjie glanced hopefully at his father.

"Since our in-law approves, proceed." Liu Jingguo acquiesced, though displeased his son needed Guan Yu's influence for advancement.

After finalizing plans to harass the Song family through bureaucratic channels, Guan Yu bid the elders goodnight. Ascending the stairs, Wen Baoguo called out gruffly: "Xiaoyu! A word."

"Yes, father-in-law?"

Wen Baoguo hemmed awkwardly before blustering: "Are you... available?"

Guan Yu feigned a yawn. "Afraid not. Want to discuss philosophy? Impossible tonight."

"You brat! Doing this on purpose?"

"Purpose? How could I guess your intentions?" Guan Yu's innocent expression fueled Wen Baoguo's rage.

"Enough! When will you give me another acupuncture treatment?"

"Acupuncture? For back pain? See a doctor—my time's precious."

"Guan Yu!" Wen Baoguo nearly drew his sidearm. The rascal knew exactly which "needles" he meant—the virility treatments enabling marital relations!

Chuckling, Guan Yu relented: "Tomorrow night. Don't disturb Mother-in-law's rest—her pregnancy's delicate. Grandfathers would skin you for endangering their grandson!"

With that, he sauntered off, leaving Wen Baoguo fuming: "Damned punk! I'll teach you respect someday!"

Chapter 1025: Accompany Me in Watching Japanese Educational Films

Entering the bedroom, Guan Yu pounced on Wen Qing, kneading her ample bosom. "Wife, these keep growing! Are you undergoing secondary puberty?"

"Your fault!" Wen Qing arched into his touch, cheeks flushing. "Constant groping stimulates expansion."

"Should make them bigger then!" Guan Yu leered. "Plentiful milk for our future children!"

"How would you know?" Wen Qing narrowed her eyes.

"Read it somewhere."

"What books?"

"Uh... illustrated ones."

"Pornography!" She yanked his ear. "What other perversions do you hide?"

"Ow! Just... Japanese educational films!"

Wen Qing's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Which actresses do you prefer?"

Guan Yu froze. "You know about those?"

"My dorm sisters discussed them." She squirmed. "They... experimented with boyfriends."

Guan Yu's grin turned vulpine. "Wife~ Let's watch together sometime!"

"Never!" She protested, then gasped as he ground against her. "Well... maybe once."

Ecstatic, Guan Yu prepared to claim his prize—only to be halted.

"Not tonight." Wen Qing smirked. "Aunt Flo's visiting."

Guan Yu collapsed in frustration. "Then why tease me?"

"Because~" She pecked his nose. "Mischief delights me!"
