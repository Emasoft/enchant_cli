“Stop fooling around. The experts hired by Master Qin – even if all of us combined – wouldn’t stand a chance against them. That shadowy operative feels even more formidable than Master Bi himself.” The bearded man said gloomily, his face twisted in frustration. “Otherwise, would I have been beaten to this state?”

“Then let’s flee,” another man suggested. “We can’t just wait here for death. If Qin’s men find this place, we’ll be trapped.”

“No good, boss! We need this hostage to exchange for the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl!” argued a third. “Since the Qins are playing dirty, why should we hold back? Let’s take this person directly to claim the treasure. If the Qins fear exposure, we certainly don’t!”

“Exactly! I’ve heard that pearl contains hidden riches. If we obtain that treasure, we’ll be set for life!”

“Release him first,” the bearded man ordered. Immediately, the ropes binding Chu Fan loosened, and the blindfold was removed from his eyes.

“Boss, why let him go? Without this hostage, how will we get the Dragon Pearl? This is our golden opportunity! If we miss this...” protested a bandit.

“To hell with your Dragon Pearl!” the bearded leader roared. “Our damned lives are hanging by a thread, yet you still covet treasures? Survival comes first!”

“We must leave before the Qins arrive. Those still obsessed with the pearl can chase it themselves. I won’t throw my life away.”

Having overheard everything, Chu Fan asked pointedly, “So the Qins ordered my capture? How laughable. I’m merely a minor actor – utterly worthless for bargaining. Their scheme is absurd.”

Chapter 5014: Keeping One’s Word

“Enough prattle! Leave now unless you fancy dying here!” The bearded man glared coldly at Chu Fan.

This unexpected turn left Chu Fan bemused. Captured by Qin’s agents yet freed due to Qin’s own machinations – danger had come and gone like passing shadows.

Eager to depart, Chu Fan brushed dirt from his robes and strode out unhindered. Guan Yu nodded imperceptibly. Though no saint, this bandit leader at least understood priorities, acting decisively when required.

“Boss, just let him walk free?” whined a wiry, monkey-like subordinate. “The Dragon Pearl slips through our fingers! Shouldn’t we reconsider?”

“What alternatives remain?” The bearded man sighed. “Though seasoned in Jianghu affairs, the capital’s waters run too deep. By dawn, we must vanish. Gather your belongings.”

“I’ve a better plan!” another interjected. “Let’s kidnap Qin Huan instead! If Chu Fan’s worthless, the Qin patriarch’s son should fetch ten thousand taels – no, a hundred thousand!”

“Clever in theory, impossible in practice,” the leader countered. “Qin Huan knows his sins. He never ventures out without guards. Capturing him would be suicide. The Qins aren’t to be trifled with – we leave tonight.”

“Then lodge at the Blade-Free Inn,” Guan Yu emerged from behind a straw curtain, startling the bandits into defensive stances. “Seek a man named Du Teng there. Mention my name, and you’ll find sanctuary. Even the Qins dare not cause trouble there.”

“How...?” The bearded man gaped. “I detected no pursuit! Your skills humble me, sir.”

“I followed to see if you’d keep your word,” Guan Yu said mildly. “You proved honest by releasing the hostage. Honor my advice, and safety awaits. Disregard it, and face Qin’s hunters alone.”

“Blade-Free Inn?” objected a bandit. “That den of masters costs fortunes! We can’t afford–”

“Du Teng will waive fees under my name. Refuse and scatter to the winds – your choice.” Having secured Chu Fan’s release, Guan Yu cared little for their fate beyond this counsel.

“We’ll heed your wisdom, sir!” The bearded leader bowed. “Without your warning, we’d be dead by morning. To the inn!”

Grumbling subordinates began packing. What began as a lucrative job – five hundred taels for a simple kidnapping – now meant fleeing for their lives. The leader sighed. From accepting this commission, their doom was sealed. Survival now depended on obeying their mysterious benefactor.

Chapter 5015: No Survivors

With Chu Fan safe, Guan Yu contemplated teaching the Qins a lesson. Their audacity in targeting the Eastern Sea treasures now threatened Eight-Sided Drum techniques – a line crossed.

By dawn, the Qins prepared ten thousand taels – four chests loaded onto a wagon with twenty guards. Guan Yu watched covertly, anticipating their reaction to the vanished captors.

Later in the Qin study, patriarch and son stared in stunned silence. “You told no one of our plans?” the elder finally growled.

“None!” Qin Huan swore. “Not even Mother!”

“Then how?” The patriarch hurled a book. “That greedy beard would never abandon silver! He must’ve learned something!”

“Perhaps he guessed our intent?” Qin Huan ventured. “Realized we’d eliminate them after?”

“Possible. But their survival threatens us! Send hunters – leave none alive!”

As reports arrived of Chu Fan’s return, the patriarch paled. “How did they know? This reeks of inside knowledge!”

“Should we silence Chu Fan too?” Qin Huan asked.

“That minstrel? His word against ours?” The patriarch scoffed. “Only Jiang Xin would heed him. Our true peril is those bandits. Find them!”

Unbeknownst to Chu Fan, Guan Yu had orchestrated his rescue. The actor believed his captors had simply quarreled with their employers. At Red Charm Theater’s near-complete reconstruction, Guan Yu found Chu Fan overseeing work.

“No lasting harm?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Merely bound days,” Chu Fan shrugged. “Amusing how fortune shifts.”

“Any idea who hired them?”

“Outsiders, by their accents. They fell out with partners, hence my release.” Chu Fan’s evasion puzzled Guan Yu. Clearly aware of Qin’s involvement yet protecting them – why?

As Chu Fan changed subjects to theater progress, Guan Yu’s disappointment grew. This secrecy, despite their bond, chilled his regard. When the project concluded, he resolved to depart – their partnership becoming transactional.

Chapter 5016: The Visit

Guan Yu studied Chu Fan, recognizing deliberate omission. If threats compelled this silence, so be it. He wouldn’t press further.

“Once finished here, I’ll depart,” Guan Yu said. “The theater is yours – per our profit agreement.”

Chu Fan nodded absently, consumed by construction details. Guan Yu turned away, final threads of camaraderie unraveling. The Qins’ next move remained uncertain, but Guan Yu vowed to curb their ambitions – for the theater’s sake, if no longer friendship’s.
