“Right now, it’s hard to explain,” Guan Yu said. “A friend of mine here is seriously ill—he’s had a high fever for a week. I’m heading to Lukong Hospital. Do you know anyone there who can help smooth things out? It’d save a lot of hassle.”

Gan Bili replied bluntly, “No connections there, I’m afraid. I’ve only been to Yangcheng once and don’t know anyone. Even if I tried reaching out, it’d take layers of intermediaries. Why don’t you call Shilei directly? I’m sure she can assist.”

“Alright. I tried calling earlier, but they must be handling something urgent—the line’s been busy. I’ll try again later.”

“Probably in an important meeting. They’ll contact you once they see your missed calls,” Gan Bili explained.

Guan Yu agreed. “How’s everything at home? Any trouble?”

“All’s quiet. Lately, Hou Jinshun’s been worried since hearing Bill Lin and Young Master Feng are getting cozy. He’s sent more people to guard the area. They’re setting up temporary housing around Qiaoyuan District—too many folks to house otherwise.”

Guan Yu chuckled ruefully. “You’re being too cautious. Relax. Bill Lin wouldn’t dare act recklessly without weighing the consequences.”

“Better safe than sorry. Overcaution isn’t a flaw…”

“Got another call—gotta go.” Guan Yu cut Gan Bili off upon seeing Du Xiaojuan’s incoming call.

The moment he answered, chaotic noises spilled through before a crisp voice asked, “Guan Yu? Why’d you call? Something wrong?”

Typically, Guan Yu never contacted them. Earlier, Du Xiaojuan had been negotiating a major deal with a foreign investor—a critical partnership for Huayu Group. Out of respect, she’d turned off her phone during the meeting.

After exiting the conference room, she’d spotted Guan Yu’s missed call. Since he rarely reached out, fearing an emergency, she’d dialed back immediately.

“Sis Juan, I know you’re busy, but I need your help,” Guan Yu began.

Du Xiaojuan was taken aback by his uncharacteristic politeness. He’d always been brusque and stubborn around her.

“You never call unless there’s trouble. Spit it out,” she said, irritation lacing her tone.

She and Liu Shilei had been monitoring Guan Yu like watchful parents, juggling Huayu Group’s demands while tracking his antics.

“I’m in Yangcheng. A friend’s sick and needs treatment at Lukong Hospital. It’s unfamiliar territory—could you connect me with someone to expedite admission?”

“Why are you in Yangcheng?” she demanded.

Guan Yu sighed, expecting the interrogation. “Driving right now. Just help me out—I’ll explain everything later.”

“You’re always gallivanting!” Du Xiaojuan snapped. “Gan Bili recently claimed you were fine—were you both lying to me?”

“No! This is urgent. I’ll explain properly later—promise. Still driving here.” His tone edged into whining.

Relenting, Du Xiaojuan dropped it. She and Liu Shilei had already discussed stepping back after finalizing this deal, planning to hand Huayu’s reins to subordinates. They were exhausted, and with operations running smoothly, it seemed time to rest.

“Just wait until Shilei and I have time to camp at Qiaoyuan District!” she threatened. “Let’s see you escape then!”

“What?!” Guan Yu yelped. “You’d abandon the company?!”

“What’s ‘what’? What’s wrong with your friend?” she feigned anger.

“High fever triggered heart issues, I think. Persistent fever—details are fuzzy.”

“Brat! Always helping others, never visiting to assist me!” Her voice dripped mock hurt.

Before he could retort, she hung up. Guan Yu stared at his phone, baffled. She hadn’t even addressed the hospital request. Annoyed, he redialed—only for an unknown number to interrupt.

Assuming her phone died, he answered. A man’s voice greeted, “Mr. Guan Yu? Professor Wang Wu here—cardiovascular specialist from Tongwei Hospital. Ms. Du contacted me.”

Guan Yu, initially suspecting spam, relaxed. “Ah, Professor Wang! My friend needs urgent admission to Lukong—”

“Lukong’s adequate,” Wang Wu interjected, “but Tongwei leads in cardiovascular care. I advise coming here.”

Groaning internally at the detour, Guan Yu relented. “Fine. Set up admission—I’ll head over.”

After directions, Guan Yu cursed the gridlock. Reversing course meant enduring more jams on narrower roads.

Two grueling hours later, they neared Tongwei Hospital. Xiao竹 fretted over her father’s worsening state, while Guan Yu fantasized about helicopters.

Finally arriving, Guan Yu spotted Wang Wu—a pudgy man eagerly waving at the gates.

“Silver Buick minivan,” Guan Yu described.

“Noted! I’ll meet you upfront!” Wang Wu scurried out, tripping over his sycophantic zeal.

Guan Yu had nearly dismissed the call as spam. Du Xiaojuan’s efficiency stunned him—contacting a specialist within minutes.

Wang Wu’s obsequiousness stemmed from Du’s influence. As Huayu Group’s medical contractor, his hefty kickbacks depended on her favor. Guan Yu’s casual use of her name signaled their close ties—a golden opportunity to curry favor.

After an infuriating U-turn and snail-paced crawl, Guan Yu checked the GPS—miles remained.

Lin Qiaoqiao griped, “Why backtrack? Are you joyriding?!”

“The specialist insisted on Tongwei! Heart cases are their specialty—we’re going!” he snapped, road rage simmering.

Xiao竹 timidly asked, “How much longer? Dad’s sweating again…”

“Patience. Gridlock’s easing ahead.”

Three hours later, they arrived. Xiao竹 gaped at skyscrapers and neon lights—a wide-eyed country mouse.

Calling Wang Wu, Guan Yu barked, “We’re here—meet us outside.”

“I’ve waited two hours already! At the parking pavilion—describe your car.”

“Silver Buick minivan. Unique enough.”

“Be right there!” Wang Wu bolted out, a flustered greeter awaiting his cash cow.
