Watching Feng Xin flee in panic, Guan Yu chuckled, leaned back on the sofa to light a cigarette, his thoughts swirling. Unconsciously, Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan had grown quite close. Now that Feng Xin knew about his relationship with Du Xiaojuan, yet still maintained this ambiguous, unspoken intimacy with him… Could she actually accept it?

The more he pondered, the more restless Guan Yu became. Excitedly rubbing his hands, he stood and headed upstairs to his room.

Hmm… Seeing Feng Xin’s clothes and personal items scattered about the room, Guan Yu felt an inexplicable thrill surge through him.

“Sister Xin… you’ve moved in too?” Guan Yu stood at the doorway, grinning foolishly as he asked.

Feng Xin turned sharply, her face flushing at the sight of him. “Weren’t you the one who told me to keep Xiaojuan company? What—now that you’re back, I should leave? Fine! I’ll pack up and give you two your private space!” she retorted, her voice dripping with醋意.

“No, no! That’s not what I meant! I’m just… happy!” Since they were alone, Guan Yu shamelessly sidled up to her with a cheeky grin.

Feng Xin’s cheeks burned as she shot him a glare, feigning nonchalance. “What’s there for you to be happy about? This has nothing to do with you!”

“Getting to see Sister Xin every day—such a beauty living under the same roof? How could I not be thrilled?”

“Get lost! Who taught you such smooth talk?” Feng Xin’s face turned crimson as she suppressed a smile, playfully shoving him away.

Guan Yu grinned triumphantly, but Feng Xin suddenly turned serious, locking eyes with him. “What about you and Zhao Jing’er? Are you… involved like with Xiaojuan?”

“Huh? No! Didn’t I say she’s just my sworn younger sister?” Guan Yu hastily explained with feigned solemnity.

“Listen here—no fooling around. Jing’er’s still so young! Keep your dirty thoughts to yourself!” Feng Xin regained her stern demeanor.

Guan Yu nodded vigorously. “Of course! She’s just a kid. I prefer mature, full-figured women like you, Sister Xin…”

“Enough!” Feng Xin stamped her foot, glaring at him with a mix of anger and embarrassment before resuming her packing. Her wardrobe—all stern blouses and slacks—looked painfully monotonous.

“Sister Xin, your clothes are too plain. Let’s go shopping later. I’ll buy you some outfits that’ll make you irresistible!” Guan Yu suggested, perching on the bed.

Feng Xin blinked. “You’re buying them for me?”

“Mhmm…” Guan Yu nodded eagerly. Success seemed within reach.

“Fine. I’ve got nothing better to do anyway.” Feng Xin agreed with affected casualness.

Wow… Feng Xin was becoming surprisingly compliant. Taming this icy, domineering woman might not be so hard after all! Guan Yu’s mind raced with excitement.

At least she no longer resisted his relationship with Du Xiaojuan. With careful pacing, perhaps…

Grinning widely, Guan Yu envisioned a harmonious future—everyone happy together.

Chapter Two Hundred and Eighty-Three: Jealousy and Anger

Taking three stunning beauties shopping drew endless stares. Upon entering the mall, Guan Yu felt waves of envy and hatred from surrounding men threatening to drown them.

Du Xiaojuan clung to his arm while Zhao Jing’er trailed behind. Worried about her frail health, Guan Yu pulled her to his other side. With two beauties flanking him and Feng Xin strolling stone-faced beside Jing’er, the scene became a spectacle of envy.

After purchasing daily necessities for Jing’er, they ascended to the clothing section. Jing’er’s model-like figure—slender yet curvaceous—made every outfit look tailor-made.

“Nice! This one’s great too!”

“That waist! We’ll take it!” Guan Yu praised endlessly as Jing’er modeled dress after dress.

Unnoticed by him, Du Xiaojuan and Feng Xin glowered darkly behind him.

“If she looks good, why are you so thrilled? What’s it to you?” Feng Xin suddenly slammed a metal chair down with a loud clang, startling nearby staff.

“Miss, please! Our floors are newly renovated—” a salesgirl began timidly.

Feng Xin’s icy stare silenced her instantly.

Coughing awkwardly, Guan Yu approached the sulking women. “Why don’t you two pick something? Sister Xin, let me help—”

“Go help your precious sworn sister!” Feng Xin snapped, cutting him off.

Undeterred, Guan Yu held up a dress. “This would look amazing—”

“I said no!” Feng Xin shot up angrily.

Guan Yu frowned, glancing between her and the despondent Du Xiaojuan before coldly turning away. Fine—let them sulk.

“Wrap all these up.” He gestured along the racks, ordering forty-plus outfits.

The clerk’s eyes lit up. Feng Xin seethed—this was deliberate provocation!

When Jing’er emerged shyly in a buttercup-yellow dress, Guan Yu smiled. “Keep it on.”

At checkout, Jing’er hesitated. “But I didn’t try them all…”

“You’ll look gorgeous in anything.” Guan Yu brushed off her concerns, ignoring the glares behind him.

“Done shopping? Let’s go.” He coolly addressed the fuming women.

“No!” Feng Xin spat through clenched teeth.

As Guan Yu handed over his card, Jing’er protested: “I can pay—”

“My treat.” He insisted, swiping decisively.

Chapter Two Hundred and Eighty-Four: Shameless

The car ride home was icy. Back at the apartment, Feng Xin plopped sulkily on the couch while Du Xiaojuan hovered tearfully. Instead of comforting them, Guan Yu took Jing’er upstairs. “Time for your treatment.”

In Jing’er’s room, Guan Yu arranged bedding before awkwardly suggesting: “You’ll need to remove the dress.”

Blushing fiercely, Jing’er whispered: “Won’t Sister Xin misunderstand?”

“They know it’s medical.” Guan Yu compromised: “Just loosen the straps.”

As creamy shoulders emerged, Guan Yu fought to focus. But when his hand slipped under her bra to reach her heart—


Feng Xin and Du Xiaojuan burst in.

“SHAMELESS!” Feng Xin screamed, witnessing Guan Yu’s hand inside Jing’er’s underwear. “Is this your ‘treatment’?!”

Guan Yu withdrew hastily. “It’s not what—”

SMACK! Feng Xin’s slap landed hard. Guan Yu didn’t flinch.

“Protecting her now?!” Feng Xin trembled with rage. “Jing’er! How dare you seduce him?!”

Guan Yu shielded the cowering girl. “OUT! This IS treatment!”

“You… you’re both disgusting!” Feng Xin’s voice broke. Du Xiaojuan sobbed silently.
