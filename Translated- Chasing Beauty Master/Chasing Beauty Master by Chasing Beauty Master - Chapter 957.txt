Zhang Dongyi, still seething with anger, growled, “You’ve also dragged our bureau’s reputation through the mud, getting us lambasted online. The higher-ups have issued orders: if the photos are verified as genuine, you’ll face severe disciplinary action, including immediate dismissal from your position as deputy bureau chief.”

Wan Bada paled, trembling as he protested, “It can’t be that serious! So what if I messed around with a woman and got exposed? Firing me outright is too much!”

“You still don’t grasp the gravity of this?” Director Zhang roared. “As deputy chief of the entire municipal bureau, how dare you think such behavior is justified? And with multiple women? Have you no shred of moral decency?”

Wan Bada’s face flushed crimson. Realizing the situation was dire and unlikely to resolve peacefully, he refused to accept defeat. “I need to call my older brother,” he declared, pulling out his phone. Zhang Dongyi sighed deeply. “If Secretary Wan can shield you, I’ll have nothing more to say.”

Secretary Wan, Wan Bada’s distant relative and full name Wan Bagao, was the sole reason the idle, incompetent Wan Bada had clung to his deputy position. Without the secretary’s backing, he’d have been ousted long ago.

When the call connected, Wan Bada blurted anxiously, “Elder Brother, come to the bureau immediately! I’m in trouble.”

“Good timing. I was about to contact you. This isn’t for the phone. I’m on my way,” Secretary Wan replied before hanging up. He had just seen the scandalous news online, and since the protagonist was his younger brother, he was determined to suppress it.

En route, Secretary Wan made frantic calls to leverage his connections. Though the scandal was explosive, he vowed to preserve his brother’s position.

Upon arriving at the bureau headquarters, Secretary Wan headed straight to Zhang Dongyi’s office. After lengthy discussions and citing the higher-ups’ directives, Zhang stated, “Secretary Wan, it’s not that I lack sympathy, but the pressure from above is immense. I never wanted things to escalate this far.”

Wan Bada, feigning composure, pleaded, “Elder Brother, you must help me! This is a deliberate frame-up!”

“I know. Let me think of a solution,” Secretary Wan said to Zhang. “How about this: let Bada take a leave of absence and lie low until the storm passes?”

Wan Bada nodded grimly. “Seems that’s our only option.”

But the matter proved far more complex. As a deputy chief, Wan Bada had his own web of influence. After deliberations between superiors and subordinates, the authorities deemed the scandal’s repercussions too severe. Reluctantly, they suspended him pending investigation.

Days later, Lin Qiaoqiao revisited Qiaoyuan District. Amei welcomed her in, only for Lin to immediately glance around and ask, “Where’s Guanyu?”

Amei stiffened, thinking, *What’s this? The moment I let her in, her first question is about Guanyu. She’s clearly throwing herself at him.* Though irritated—any girl would be—Amei managed a smile. “Guanyu and Jingjing went out on business. They’ll be back soon. Have some fruit while you wait.”

“What bad timing! I should’ve called first,” Lin sighed. She’d considered it but realized she didn’t even have Guanyu’s number. “Well, I’ll wait then.”

Lin made herself at home, lounging on the sofa and nibbling fruit. Nearby, Yingzi sat watching TV, engrossed in a Chinese variety show to improve her language skills. A hefty dictionary lay open on her lap as she puzzled over unfamiliar characters.

Curious, Lin asked, “Yingzi, why the dictionary?”

“Oh, I’m learning Chinese. It’s so hard! Many characters look alike but sound different and mean entirely different things. So rich!” Yingzi replied cheerfully.

“You’re only starting now? At your age?”

“Yes, just a year ago.”

“You’re not Chinese? I couldn’t tell at all!” Lin trailed off, realizing Yingzi’s nationality—given her appearance and need for a dictionary—was obvious.

Changing the subject, Lin scooted closer. “How long have you lived here?” She glanced around the luxuriously yet tastefully decorated villa, noticing details she’d missed during her rushed previous visit.

“About ten days,” Yingzi answered.

“What? You’ve only known Guanyu that long? So you’re his new flame?” Lin blurted, then flushed, chiding herself for overthinking.

“No, I’ve known him for years. I just moved in recently,” Yingzi clarified.

Lin’s mind raced: *Is Yingzi his mistress? Probably. Exposed, so he brought her here.* Deciding not to pry, she fell silent until Guanyu and Xue Jing returned.

“Qiaoqiao! When did you arrive?” Xue Jing greeted cheerfully.

“Not long ago. I came to discuss something with Guanyu,” Lin replied with a grin.

Guanyu smiled. “Something good or bad?”

“Very good—and you’ll benefit greatly! Want to hear?” Lin teased.

Xue Jing noted Lin’s starry-eyed gaze, akin to a man ogling a beauty.

Lin continued, “Guanyu, thanks for your help. Wan Bada’s suspended, and the bureau’s calmer now. But his influence remains. I fear he’ll retaliate against you secretly.”

“Don’t worry about me. He’s no threat,” Guanyu assured, sitting down. “Is that all you came for?”

“Of course not!” Lin leaned forward excitedly. “Actually, I need a favor from Jingjing.”

Xue Jing blinked. “From me?”

“Yes! Lend me Guanyu for a day. That’s all!” Lin beamed.

Xue Jing gaped. “What… what for?”

Guanyu, equally puzzled, smirked. “I’m willing, but Jingjing must agree. I’m a principled man.”

Xue Jing hesitated. “Qiaoqiao, I want to help, but… it’s complicated.”

“Then it’s settled! Sunday at Forest Grand Hotel!” Lin declared, ignoring her friend’s reluctance.

Xue Jing sighed. “Fine. But he’s only *borrowed*, got it? No funny business!”

Lin giggled. “Depends on Guanyu’s self-control!”

“My self-control is ironclad,” Guanyu vowed.

Come Sunday, Lin arrived early in her Beetle. “Let’s take your car. It’s more imposing.”

“Sure,” Guanyu agreed, eyeing an opportunity to visit Jin Hua afterward regarding the golden dagger.

“Let’s go!” Lin urged.

“Patience. Arriving fashionably late boosts my value as your fake boyfriend. We’ll enter after they’re all seated,” Guanyu advised.

That evening, Guanyu’s Range Rover pulled up to Forest Grand Hotel. By coincidence—or design—they were again in Private Room No. 2 on the fifth floor. Lin’s phone buzzed incessantly; her parents and the suitor’s family had long awaited them.

Pushing open the door, Lin strode in hand-in-hand with Guanyu. Five pairs of eyes locked onto them: her parents Lin Zhiyu and Wang Jie, the suitor Fang Su, and his parents Fang Wenjian and wife.

Wang Jie rushed over. “Qiaoqiao! Finally! Let me introduce—” She froze, spotting Guanyu.

“Mom, Dad, this is my boyfriend, Guanyu,” Lin announced.

Fang Su stood abruptly. “Guanyu?!”

Guanyu nodded. “We met at last year’s citywide taekwondo tournament. You represented Century Garden Academy.”

Lin Zhiyu slammed the table. “Outrageous! Is this how a proper girl behaves?!”

Unfazed, Guanyu addressed Fang Su. “Why am I here? To meet my future in-laws. Any objections?”
