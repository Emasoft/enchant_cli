“Members of other peaks generally dare not confront those from Tiger Head Peak under normal circumstances, and even when they do, they would never dare challenge Lin Chen or Ling Su’s subordinates.

Lin Chen has long established his influence within Tiger Head Peak. Currently consolidating his forces, he finds such a structure particularly useful for suppressing younger disciples beneath him.

Lin Chen and Ling Su are Xuan Ming’s most favored aides, akin to imperial confidants beside an emperor. Even when they err, they face no punishment, emboldening them to act with increasing audacity and disregard for others.

Many disciples willingly follow them, believing Lin Chen’s prominence within the Yunqing Sect positions him as a future candidate for Sect Leader. Aligning themselves early promises great benefits once he ascends to power.

**Chapter 3163: Such Arrogance**

Within the Yunqing Sect, aside from the Sect Leader and the Chiefs of the major peaks, Lin Chen and Ling Su wield the greatest influence. None dare provoke them lightly, fearing retaliation. Those who resent them simply keep their distance.

Yet tonight’s events have sparked fervent discussion. Guan Yu, a newcomer, has eclipsed Lin Chen and Ling Su’s reputations in a single evening.

After Xuan Ming’s departure, a disciple whispered, “It seems the hierarchy among Yunqing Sect disciples is about to shift again.”

“Indeed! Guan Yu is extraordinary. In just one day, he injured both Ling Su and Lin Chen, yet Sect Leader didn’t reprimand him—not even a minor punishment. What does that signify?”

“True. Guan Yu is no ordinary figure. But let’s stay out of it. Watch quietly as they clash. It’s none of our concern.”

Amidst the chatter, many who harbored resentment toward Lin Chen began plotting to ally with Guan Yu. Numerous disciples chafed under Lin Chen and Ling Su’s bullying. If Guan Yu could solidify his standing on Tiger Head Peak, aligning with him might prove advantageous.

Guan Yu walked beside Si Qi, with Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian trailing far behind. Their inaction during his earlier peril had angered Si Qi, who chastised them.

Si Qi’s primary grievance was that Guan Yu was their charge—they were tasked with escorting him safely to the Ancestral Hall in the back mountain. Yet when he faced danger, they stood idly by, which she found inexcusable.

Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian retorted that Lin Chen, as the Sect Leader’s favorite, was untouchable. Defying him would invite dire consequences.

Hearing this, Guan Yu chuckled coldly. “Sister Si Qi, does Lin Chen truly enjoy Sect Leader Xuan Ming’s unwavering support? Why does everyone fear him? I see nothing formidable about him.”

“Sect Leader Xuan Ming has four disciples—now five, including you. Lin Chen is his most prized and indulged disciple. Everyone knows the Sect Leader is partial to his own. Thus, even when Lin Chen errs, he escapes punishment, growing bolder by the day. He consolidates factions and crushes opposition, leaving all too fearful to cross him.”

Guan Yu pressed, “Does Sect Leader Xuan Ming condone such arrogance? Wouldn’t the disciples resent him for it?”

Si Qi explained, “Resentment is minimal. Disciples from other peaks rarely visit Tiger Head Peak. Most victims are newcomers training here—elites focused on cultivation. They endure the bullying, opting to avoid Lin Chen afterward.”

Guan Yu was appalled. Lin Chen exploited the Sect Leader’s favor to bully disciples and form cliques targeting newcomers. Allowing this to fester would doom the Yunqing Sect.

Having led a powerful gang in the city, Guan Yu resolved to challenge Lin Chen’s faction during his stay here.

Passing through Tiger Head Peak, they entered a bamboo forest with a narrow stone path barely wide enough for two.

“Beyond this forest and a cliffside chain bridge lies the Ancestral Hall,” Guan Yu said, pointing ahead.

Si Qi nodded. “This is only my second time here. The first was as a child, when my master brought me to beg Grandmaster Jiu to heal my severe injuries. The place remains unchanged from my memory.”

Curious, Guan Yu asked, “What of your family? Where did you live before?”

The question darkened Si Qi’s expression, hinting at painful memories she wished to avoid.

“Apologies. I didn’t mean to pry,” Guan Yu offered.

“Thank you for shielding me earlier,” Si Qi suddenly said, recalling his earlier act.

Guan Yu smiled. “As a man, how could I let a woman protect me? Standing forward was only right.”

Si Qi frowned. “But Sect Leader said your cultivation is sealed. When you blocked Lin Chen’s spell and coughed blood, I feared you’d die. Yet you emerged unscathed. Without inner energy or spiritual power, how did you survive?”

“You noticed,” Guan Yu laughed. “I used a super artifact to shield myself. That’s the secret.”

“Ah! The artifacts Sect Leader and Chief Lu gifted you are near-divine. Blocking a minor spell would be trivial,” Si Qi realized.

As they walked, Guan Yu regaled her with tales of city life—skyscrapers, cars, and a world beyond her imagination. Si Qi listened raptly, envisioning realities she’d never conceived.

Gradually, their conversation grew effortless. “I long to visit your metropolis,” Si Qi admitted. “To witness these marvels firsthand.”

Grinning, Guan Yu vowed, “I’ll take you there someday. You’ll stay at my home.” His tone carried unspoken implications.

**Chapter 3164: More Precious Than Life**

“Promise?” Si Qi said evenly. “No taking it back.” Her voice softened, though her expression remained stoic.

Guan Yu sensed her cold demeanor masked warmth, emerging when topics engaged her.

“One more warning,” Si Qi said abruptly.

“Yes?”

“How old are you?”

Guan Yu paused. By his academic records, he answered, “Twenty.”

“A mere child. I’m twenty-one—address me as ‘elder sister.’”

“Elder Sister Si Qi, you look barely seventeen!” Guan Yu teased, inwardly amused. Titles mattered little; charming her was the goal.

“Regardless, you’ll call me ‘elder sister,’” Si Qi insisted.

“As you wish. Now, Elder Sister Si Qi, why do cultivators like you carry swords? Shouldn’t you rely on artifacts?”

Si Qi glanced at her blade. “Most lack materials to forge proper artifacts. We’re given Cloudgreen Swords upon joining—low-grade artifacts aiding cultivation. Mine is superior, gifted by my master.”

Guan Yu’s gaze dismissed the sword as crude. “Why doesn’t Chief Dai give you better artifacts?”

“High-grade artifacts are more precious than life to Chiefs. They’d never bestow them lightly. Until we can craft our own, we use these.”

Reaching the cliff’s edge, they faced the chain bridge to the Ancestral Hall. Planks lay over iron chains, far sturdier than the bare cables Guan Yu had crossed with Chief Lu.

“I’ll proceed alone,” Guan Yu said.

As Si Qi turned to leave, he produced Chief Lu’s Jade Ruyi—a luminous, feminine super artifact. “This suits you better,” he offered.

Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian gaped enviously.

“It’s too valuable!” Si Qi refused.

Guan Yu displayed his four artifacts: “The Imperial Seal is my bonded auxiliary tool. The Soulrend Blade will be my primary. The Jade Ruyi and Blazing Furnace are mere collectibles. Take it.”

The maids nearly lunged forward.

“If you decline, I’ll gift it to them,” Guan Yu threatened.

“Mine!” Si Qi snatched it, cheeks flushing. “But... others might steal it!”

“Once given, I won’t reclaim it. Discard it if you wish.”

Torn, Si Qi fretted, “This treasure endangers me. I won’t survive three days carrying it!”

**Chapter 3165: A Heaven-Sent Opportunity**

Relenting, Guan Yu advised, “Bind it now. Your cultivation will soar.”

Hands trembling, Si Qi replied, “I must first ask my master to unbind my sword. Only then can I claim this.”

She hesitated, fearing bandits. “What if Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian betray me? Or others on Tiger Head Peak?”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Discard it then.”

Resigned, Si Qi accepted. “Thank you. I’ll treasure it.”

Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian sulked, denied even a touch.

“Remember,” Guan Yu warned, “this stays between us.”

Nodding, Si Qi clutched the Jade Ruyi, her heart racing with possibility and peril.
