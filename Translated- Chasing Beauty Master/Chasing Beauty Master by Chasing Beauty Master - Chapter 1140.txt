The two venues previously managed by Ge Yinglai (Revolutionary Hero) were burned beyond recognition by the crowd. After being seized by Guan Yu, they underwent a period of reorganization and reopened a few days ago.

However, through extensive inquiries and information from former staff, it became clear that business here had declined drastically. Even after lowering prices, foot traffic remained far below past levels.

After considering multiple factors, it was concluded that Ma Tong’s casino had siphoned away their customers. This prompted Guan Yu to send people to investigate the situation at Ma Tong’s establishment.

Ma Tong’s casino bustled with activity, its novel offerings proving wildly popular, particularly among middle-aged patrons. The venue not only provided excellent service but also avoided blatant exploitation—winning small sums there was relatively easy.

Such a place, blending entertainment with the chance to earn money, naturally drew crowds. Ma Tong, with years of casino management experience, understood that while some players might pocket minor gains, these were trivial compared to the real profits.

The casino’s true targets were the tycoons who gambled purely for thrill, indifferent to losses of tens of thousands daily. These clients formed the core of the casino’s revenue, while small-time players bragging about occasional wins of a few hundred dollars inadvertently fueled the venue’s reputation.

Word of mouth spread rapidly—those who won money boasted, attracting ever more visitors. The casino’s booming business testified to its profitability.

After days of surveillance, Guan Yu obtained data revealing Ma Tong’s casino attracted massive foot traffic, particularly after 7 PM, averaging 400 to 500 nightly patrons.

Moreover, the casino operated 24/7, catering to players with ample leisure time. One Yu Gang member who spent a full day there noted its exceptional services: midnight breaks with complimentary宵夜 (night snacks), the quality of which depended on membership tiers and chips exchanged.

For instance, the Yu Gang member, who initially exchanged only 1,000 yuan, received a fried egg and ordinary wine. High-rolling VIPs, however, enjoyed lavish spreads of任意挑选 (freely chosen) delicacies.

The宵夜 hour became a display of status—what one ate invited either envy or disdain. Concurrently, the casino rotated staff during this half-hour break, allowing both servers and patrons to recharge before resuming play—a policy praised for its人性化 (human-centric) design.

Guan Yu frowned at the report. “At least 500 patrons daily—this figure is staggering. Entertainment venues citywide are suffering. Ma Tong’s influence is undeniable.”

Xue Jing examined the data. Ma Tong’s casino alone doubled the combined foot traffic of Guan Yu’s northern城北 (city north) bar and lounge—an alarming disparity.

“With such crowds, profitability is inevitable. Ma Tong’s decades of experience shine through. Remarkable,” Xue Jing remarked.

“Indeed,” Guan Yu agreed. “Few nationwide could achieve this. His business acumen surpasses most.”

Xue Jing suddenly pointed to a note: “Look—our informant wrote, ‘Poison Widow entered the casino and went directly upstairs.’”

“Do you think she went to gamble?” Guan Yu asked.

Xue Jing shook her head. “Unlikely. As one of the martial world’s Ten Great Villains, she’s no idle gambler. She likely sought Ma Tong—on Bill Lin’s orders. Bill Lin hasn’t abandoned efforts to recruit Ma Tong.”

“Agreed. After today’s humiliation at the school gates, Bill Lin must be fuming,” Guan Yu said, referencing the earlier confrontation where Bill Lin retreated without attacking despite having fifty cultivators.

“His restraint shows growth,” Xue Jing noted. “Even your enemies evolve under your influence.”

Guan Yu grimaced. “Had Bill Lin shown such caution earlier, he wouldn’t have lost Sun Xu and Ge Yinglai. His past recklessness cost him dearly.”

Xue Jing teased, “Your haste to rescue Shuangshuang left you unprepared. Blame yourself, not Jia Bo.”

Guan Yu acknowledged the risk—had Bill Lin attacked, the outcome might have been dire. “Ma Tong’s success irks me,” he admitted. “If he allies with Bill Lin, we must tread carefully. Yet this could be our chance to dismantle both.”

Though eager to crush Ma Tong’s casino for draining Yu Gang’s revenue, Guan Yu recognized the need for justification. “We can’t act without cause. We’ll monitor closely and await their misstep.”

Xue Jing urged action: “Poison Widow’s frequent visits suggest collusion. We must prepare.”

Guan Yu increased surveillance while contemplating strategies.

Meanwhile, at the Feng residence, Bill Lin pressured Young Master Feng to fund a scheme: infiltrate Guan Yu’s leather factory with fake clients, sabotage production, and demand违约 (breach of contract) penalties.

Reluctant to invest, Feng yielded under threat of Bill Lin’s withdrawal. Two collaborators were recruited—Lai Huangsi, a portly Feng family associate, and Qiu Wanzhang, a shady businessman.

Over wine, Bill Lin outlined the plan: “Massive orders will strain the factory. Sun Xu’s men will steal goods, causing delivery shortfalls. The赔偿 (compensation) will cripple Guan Yu.”

Qiu smirked. “A flawless plan. The contract must stipulate hefty penalties.”

Bill Lin grinned. “Finally, we’ll reclaim what Guan Yu stole. This time, victory is ours.”

As the conspirators toasted, Guan Yu’s spies watched unseen, their report already en route—the game had just begun.
