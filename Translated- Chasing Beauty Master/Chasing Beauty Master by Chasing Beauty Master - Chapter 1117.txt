Moreover, Zhang De had also invoked the Yang Family's name. In these parts, the only Yang Family capable of purchasing treasure maps would undoubtedly be the foremost among the Four Great Clans.

Old Wu, upon hearing this guest was sent by the Yang Family, immediately became deferential. He smiled apologetically, "So you're an envoy from Patriarch Yang! No wonder your bearing is extraordinary. My old eyes failed to recognize your status earlier—my deepest apologies."

"Rest assured, we won't hold such trivial matters against you," Zhang De declared without hesitation. "Patriarch Yang has dispatched me specifically to acquire that treasure map in your possession. Name your price."

Every word Zhang De spoke had been meticulously rehearsed under Guan Yu's instruction, hence their effortless delivery.

Bill Lin grew visibly anxious. Never had he anticipated the Yang Family's involvement. "Master Wu," he interjected urgently, "I too have come for this purpose and have waited since dawn. Surely you'll..."

Old Wu had initially envisioned a lucrative transaction, but now found himself caught between two formidable forces—the Yang Family and Bill Clan backing the Feng Family. Offending either could spell disaster.

With only one map available, the elderly pawnbroker recalled his apprentice's cryptic remark about "striking fortune." Retrieving the business card from his pocket, he announced, "Gentlemen, please remain patient. I must attend to a brief matter."

Locking himself in the back room, Old Wu dialed the number.

**Chapter 2859: Too Greedy**

Second Only to Wolf answered brusquely, "Who's this?"

"I'm Master Wu of Golden Pawnshop. You left your contact with my apprentice regarding... prosperous opportunities?"

"Indeed," came the sly reply. "I propose a collaboration. The map should fetch fifteen million at minimum. Any excess beyond twenty million, we split ninety-ten—my ninety, your ten."

Old Wu scoffed at the audacity. "Your terms are preposterous! The bidding war outside guarantees twenty million effortlessly. I need no middleman."

"Without my guidance," the voice warned coldly, "you'll struggle to reach fifteen. Reconsider when reality strikes."

Dismissing the threat, Old Wu returned to the shopfront where tensions simmered.

**Chapter 2860: This Time It's Different**

Bill Lin studied Zhang De suspiciously. "Why would Patriarch Yang suddenly seek this map after auctioning others?"

"Our Patriarch's designs are beyond our questioning," Zhang De deflected, then feigned a slip: "Though he did mention... this fragment's particular significance."

The calculated leak achieved its purpose—Bill Lin's eyes gleamed with renewed determination.

Meanwhile, Zhang De leaned closer conspiratorially. "Between us, have you never questioned these maps' authenticity? Our Patriarch harbors doubts. Why else would that farmer sell here instead of through proper auctions?"

Bill Lin's confidence wavered. The seeds of distrust took root—exactly as Guan Yu's script intended.

As the psychological warfare unfolded, Second Only to Wolf smirked at his silenced phone. The old fool would learn soon enough—in this game of tigers and wolves, lone players never survived intact.
