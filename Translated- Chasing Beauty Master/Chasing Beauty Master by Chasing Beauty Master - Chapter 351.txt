“Moreover, the enmity between him and Jiang Ziqi has reached an irreconcilable point. If this life-and-death struggle continues indefinitely, although he doesn’t fear Jiang Ziqi himself, there are women behind him. He can’t allow these women to fall into danger. He must strangle the threat in its cradle.

Only by making his opponent fear him to the bone and be controlled by him can he truly be safe.

Furthermore, this is already the second time he’s done such a thing!

The first time was targeting Wan Qianshan, the Taiwanese underworld boss, thereby seizing control of the entire Taiwanese underground forces. Although this control remains tenuous at best, it’s better than nothing.

Moreover, the bloodthirsty worms he carried were originally prepared for his next trip to Taiwan to completely control Wan Qianshan.

But since he encountered Jiang Ziqi today, he wouldn’t waste this opportunity.

‘Guan Yu, I swear on my life—I will kill you! I’ll kill you!’ Jiang Ziqi roared through gritted teeth, enduring immense physical pain.

Guan Yu shrugged nonchalantly, sneering, ‘Last time was your best chance. Pity you didn’t seize it. That means you’ll never get such an opportunity again!’

‘You’re already my defeated foe!’ Guan Yu mocked, then smirked at Jiang Ziqi. ‘Doesn’t this feel awful? Beg me! Beg, and I’ll spare you temporary relief!’

‘Just kill me!’ Jiang Ziqi’s gums bled from clenching his teeth, yet he refused to yield.

‘Haha, your life’s too precious to waste. I wouldn’t dare kill you!’ Guan Yu chuckled.

‘Of course, making you suffer a bit—that I dare do!’

After speaking, Guan Yu pulled up a chair and sat down, crossing his legs, grabbing a handful of melon seeds. He cracked them while watching Jiang Ziqi with amusement.

‘Care to join me?’ Guan Yu offered melon seeds to Lin Dong.

‘I want nothing to do with a pervert who enjoys torture. Play by yourself!’ Lin Dong walked away disdainfully.

Guan Yu nearly threw the seeds at Lin Dong’s retreating figure.

Pervert? Torturer?

Damn it! Such descriptions should fit the target! He was facing Jiang Ziqi, not a woman!

Guan Yu lost his appetite for seeds, glaring at Jiang Ziqi. Without using the pet system, he halted the bloodthirsty worms’ torment.

He wanted Jiang Ziqi’s submission—only then could dialogue continue.

Moreover, he was confident Jiang Ziqi would yield!

Sure enough, after five minutes of agony, Jiang Ziqi broke.

Bloody tears streamed from Jiang Ziqi’s eyes, his face twisted grotesquely.

‘Guan Yu… I beg you… stop this torture! Tell me what you want!’

Guan Yu smiled, mentally commanding the worms to cease.

Jiangziqi’s struggles weakened, leaving him utterly drained.

‘I thought you’d be more stalwart. Ten minutes couldn’t endure? Disappointing!’ Guan Yu scoffed.

Had Jiang Ziqi strength left, he’d have cursed Guan Yu’s callousness.

‘You think you’re some enduring hero? Let me enlighten you—there’s no escaping the worms. Even death won’t kill them!’

Jiang Ziqi refused to believe, clinging to hopes of revenge.

‘Enough! Swear allegiance, or suffer endlessly.’

After prolonged torment, Jiang Ziqi relented: ‘I submit.’

Guan宇 grinned. ‘Smart choice. From now on, you’re my subordinate. Cross me, and the worms ensure your end.’

Jiang Ziqi’s defiance crumbled, forced into servitude.

Subordinate?

Jiang Ziqi—scion of Beijing’s elite—now a servant? Unthinkable!

Yet, under excruciating pain, he capitulated.

‘Never!’ Jiang Ziqi initially refused, but agony broke his resolve.

‘Either serve or perish,’ Guan Yu declared.

Defeated, Jiang Ziqi submitted, becoming Guan Yu’s unwilling pawn.

Chapter 886: Return Journey

Back at Hot Bar’s second floor, Wenqing’s group waited anxiously.

‘Should we check on him?’ Zhao Jing’er fretted.

‘He’ll handle it,’ Wenqing assured.

When Guan宇 returned, they bombarded him with questions.

‘It was Jiang Ziqi,’ Guan Yu revealed.

‘That persistent pest!’ Mo Ling fumed.

Guan宇 shrugged. ‘He’s dealt with. Now, let’s enjoy the night.’

Despite tensions, the group resumed festivities, though shadows of conflict lingered.
