Guan Yu naturally understood Liu Shilei's thoughts. He nodded emphatically and declared, "Of course! Sis, I'll teach you cultivation tonight. That way, we can be together forever."

Liu Shilei nodded in return but countered, "However, I won't stay with you until I'm certain I can reach your level of cultivation!"

Guan Yu chuckled ruefully. "Alright, I understand."

He suddenly recalled his noon appointment with Hou Jinshun at the school gate. Engrossed in conversation with Liu Shilei, he had completely lost track of time. Glancing at the wall clock, he realized classes had ended nearly half an hour earlier. He wondered if Hou Jinshun was still waiting.

"Damn it, Sis! I promised to meet friends at the school gate. I need to go see them. Let's have lunch together later, alright?"

Though still harboring minor reservations after their long separation, Liu Shilei couldn't bear to part from Guan Yu and readily agreed.

As they descended to the fourth floor, they spotted Zhu Qianqian lingering in the office, periodically glancing toward the stairwell. The fact that Liu Shilei had personally received Guan Yu and spent over two hours conversing with him only solidified Zhu Qianqian's suspicion—this student must undoubtedly be Principal Liu's son. Why else would they have so much to discuss?

Noticing Liu Shilei's tear-streaked cheeks as they approached, Zhu Qianqian hastily lowered her head, feigning busywork. Liu Shilei pinched Guan Yu's side and whispered reproachfully, "This is all your fault! Little Zhu must be imagining heaven knows what!" Yet upon reflection, she giggled softly, "She probably thinks you're my secret love child!"

Through his spiritual senses, Guan Yu instantly discerned Zhu Qianqian's thoughts. Frowning, he teased, "Sis, that makes me the loser here. You'll have to compensate me with a kiss later."

Having shared intimate moments decades prior, Liu Shilei—who had remained chaste and lonely all these years—felt her entire body flush at his words. Her cheeks burned crimson as she scolded, "Shameless!" Guan Yu's heart stirred with regret over his earlier promise to spend the night at Sun Xiaoya's residence.

Contemplating Liu Shilei's earnest desire to cultivate, Guan Yu resolved not to delay her training. Only by proving her capability in cultivation could she accept reuniting with him. He decided to commence her instruction that very evening, anticipating opportunities for intimacy during the process. *Perhaps I should emphasize how dual cultivation accelerates progress,* he mused, recalling several potent dual cultivation techniques acquired in the demonic realm.

Exiting the administration building, they were startled to find Sun Xiaoya's car still parked outside. Spotting Guan Yu and Liu Shilei emerging together, Sun Xiaoya rushed over and anxiously inquired, "Principal Liu, Guan Yu just transferred here recently. Has he caused any trouble?"

Since Guan Yu's arrival at Mingyang Elite Academy, Wang Jun and his cronies had persistently harassed him. Sun Xiaoya remained acutely aware of last night's off-campus confrontation, assuming Guan Yu had been summoned for disciplinary action.

Though Guan Yu had informed Sun Xiaoya about attending school alone in Y City without local relatives, their shared secret compelled her protective instincts.

Sun Xiaoya's prolonged wait surprised both Guan Yu and Liu Shilei. The principal hastily responded, "Oh, Guan Yu hasn't caused any issues. His conduct has been exemplary. Those delinquent students indeed required proper discipline."

Sun Xiaoya gaped in astonishment. *Since when does the notoriously strict principal who abhors student brawls endorse such behavior? Shouldn't the administration handle troublemakers like Wang Jun? Is she actually praising Guan Yu's violence as heroic?*

Recognizing her misstep, Liu Shilei amended, "Though Guan Yu's methods were somewhat excessive. As his homeroom teacher, you must better supervise him. Actually, Guan Yu is my cousin. I should have informed you earlier. I understand he's been lodging at your residence recently—this is wholly inappropriate. He shall move into my home henceforth."

Having learned about Guan Yu posing as Sun Xiaoya's husband to care for her Alzheimer's-afflicted mother, Liu Shilei seized this chance to clarify their relationship.

Panic flashed across Sun Xiaoya's features. While not doubting the familial claim, she worried about managing her mother without Guan Yu's presence. Her pleading eyes turned to Guan Yu.

*So my 'wife' becomes my cousin,* Guan Yu inwardly chuckled. Though convenient for future interactions with Liu Shilei, a forty-year-old woman claiming a high school freshman as cousin struck him as absurd.

Noticing Sun Xiaoya's distress, Guan Yu interceded, "Cousin, perhaps I should remain with Teacher Sun a few more days before moving to your place."

Understanding his intent to treat Sun's mother, Liu Shilei acquiesced. "Very well. Teacher Sun, your dedication to student welfare merits commendation. I shall showcase your exemplary care at the next faculty meeting!"

Unaware of Liu Shilei's teasing, Sun Xiaoya flushed crimson. "N-no! Principal, please don't! I merely...he needed temporary housing...just please keep this confidential!" She scrambled into her car and sped away.

Liu Shilei's mischievous laughter bubbled forth, stirring Guan Yu's desires. For two decades, this marked her first genuine joy—not from teasing Sun Xiaoya, but from her beloved's return.

Approaching the school gate, they found Hou Jinshun pacing anxiously beside the same intoxicated woman from last night. Liu Shilei shot Guan Yu a withering glare. "How impressive! You've acquired such a stunning companion within days!"

Guan Yu sighed. "Sis, I merely rescued her last night. I don't even know her name. The lecherous guy's my new friend."

"Birds of a feather," Liu Shilei retorted. "You're sufficiently roguish to befriend such scoundrels."

Hou Jinshun showed no surprise at Guan Yu's Mercedes-Benz ride—expected for Mingyang's affluent students. Upon entering, he eyed Liu Shilei. "Big Bro, is this your missus? Also a student here? She's gorgeous!"

From profile, Liu Shilei's figure betrayed no hint of her forty years. Though pleased by the unintended compliment, she corrected, "Guan Yu's my cousin. I'm Principal Liu Shilei."

The woman interjected snidely, "Liu Shilei? Rumor says she's over forty. You don't look it—fine maintenance."

Liu Shilei's smile froze. Guan Yu mentally cursed the woman's tactlessness before addressing Hou Jinshun. "Didn't I tell you to send this drunkard packing? Must we adopt every damsel in distress?"

Hou Jinshun shrugged helplessly. "She claims homelessness. Says we're responsible since we saved her."

Exasperated, Guan Yu snapped, "Listen, Miss. We don't know you from Eve. Either marry Hou here or scram."

The woman recoiled in outrage. "Me? Wed this gutter rat? I'm Ouyang Yihan of the Ouyang Clan! How dare you insult me!"

At her declaration, Liu Shilei and Hou Jinshun gasped in unison. "The Ouyang heiress?"

The Ouyang family dominated Y City's industrial landscape. Their mechanical innovations—from electric vehicles to sci-fi replica weapons—earned massive profits and renown. The clan's jewel, Ouyang Yihan, was celebrated as a peerless beauty and Stanford PhD—making her drunken bar plight inexplicable.

Though sensing deeper troubles behind her escapade, Guan Yu—overwhelmed by his own affairs—snapped, "Whether you're Ouyang's princess or南宫's concubine, we're done here. Leave."

Ouyang Yihan glared defiantly. "You rescued me, took me to a hotel, and now discard me? I'm staying. Toss me out if you dare!"

Trapped by her obstinacy, Guan Yu sought allies, but Liu Shilei focused on driving while Hou Jinshun studied passing scenery. Relenting, Guan Yu demanded, "Fine, your highness. Why flee home?"

Smugness returned to Ouyang Yihan's features. "Better manners, junior. Never challenge women—you're outmatched."

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. *Were Sis absent, I'd teach you proper respect,* he fumed internally.

The group settled at a restaurant. Despite longing for privacy, Liu Shilei ordered alcohol—raising eyebrows when she encouraged her "student cousin" to drink. Observing her deference to Guan Yu's every word, Ouyang Yihan grew increasingly perplexed by their dynamic.

Over lunch, Ouyang Yihan unraveled her plight. The Ouyang conglomerate specialized in licensed production of recreational firearms and sci-fi weapon replicas. Six months prior, mysterious clients commissioned a peculiar device—nonfunctional prototypes resembling fantasy arms.

Weeks after delivery, military investigators stormed in, presenting photos of pseudo-empowered soldiers neutralized by the "toys'" laser-like emissions. Though nonlethal, the rays erased artificial abilities—sparking fears about potential use against true mutants.

The military demanded client details, warning of dire consequences should these weapons destabilize global power balances. Now ostracized and threatened, the Ouyang patriarch's former confidence crumbled—prompting his daughter's desperate bid for external aid.

Guan Yu listened impassively, recognizing the gravity yet reluctant to entangle himself further. Ouyang Yihan's calculating gaze never wavered—this youth radiated an authority surpassing her father's prime. Her instincts screamed that salvation lay with him.
