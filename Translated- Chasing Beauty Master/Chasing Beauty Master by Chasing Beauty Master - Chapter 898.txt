Chapter 2301: Sitting Down to Talk

This was the only way left. Guan Yu knew these opponents were not only cultivators, but several carried firearms.

When these people stood earlier, Guan Yu noticed their guns. While he and Second-to-Wolf could handle themselves, stray bullets might injure Jinhua and Acai if chaos erupted. Thus, Guan Yu demanded all weapons be surrendered to ensure safer negotiations.

Weapons meant survival. Though Guan Yu ordered their surrender, none complied—his authority insufficient.

Maintaining his calm smile, Guan Yu remarked, “I carry no guns. This grenade came from Chen Xiaona. Do you truly wish to test its explosion while aiming firearms at me?” His tone remained light as he scanned the room.

Karasi stood farthest, her face paling with fear. Guan Yu realized only her command could disarm the group.

Though not the strongest cultivator here, higher status bred greater fear of death. Wealth bred superstition—universal truths.

Even at a distance, grenades could be thrown. Karasi had no desire to become minced flesh.

“Without surrendering weapons, we cannot talk. Let’s skip to the exciting part.” Guan Yu moved to pull the grenade’s pin.

“Wait!” Karasi urgently intervened.

She couldn’t guarantee escape before detonation. Casualties would be inevitable—too extreme when mutual destruction wasn’t necessary. Guan Yu’s resolute eyes convinced her he’d detonate without hesitation.

Exhaling deeply, Karasi ordered, “Throw down your weapons.” The group hesitated, glancing uncertainly at each other.

“Throw them NOW! Are you deaf?” Karasi suddenly roared, trembling with rage.

Gao Shen understood best. Clutching a dagger, he clanged it before Guan Yu after seeing Karasi’s fury.

“Good.” Guan Yu released the grenade pin. Others followed, disarming under Gao Shen’s example.

Guan Yu suspected hidden firearms remained, but few enough to manage.

“Madam Karasi, if you surrender your weapon, I’ll discard this grenade. Safety first for productive talks, yes?”

Guan Yu knew Karasi carried arms—common in Western nations unlike firearm-restricted China. Here, even illegal organizations stockpiled weapons, as evidenced by Chen Xiaona’s grenade.

Karasi’s anger lingered. Gao Shen snapped, “Who do you think you are? A grenade doesn’t make you invincible!”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. “Who’s this clown? I’m speaking to Madam Karasi. Do you overrule her authority?”

The provocation terrified Gao Shen. “Madam, I meant no disrespect! Don’t believe this slander!”

“I know your loyalty,” Karasi calmly assured.

Guan Yu pressed, “If innocent, why panic? Madam Karasi has magnanimity beyond petty minds.”

Though recognizing Guan Yu’s manipulations, Karasi assessed their formidable group. Avoiding conflict seemed prudent.

Despite her age, Karasi maintained youthful vigor in black leather pants. From them, she produced an exquisite white revolver, sliding it across the table.

Guan Yu grinned, picking it up. “Thank you for cooperating.” He tossed the grenade outside—tense breaths held until silence confirmed safety.

With the major threat gone, Karasi steadied herself. Even if outmatched, escape remained possible.

“Shall we talk now?” she asked, sitting.

“Certainly.” Guan Yu pulled a chair, beckoning Acai forward. “I’m here for my brother.”

Gao Shen glared. “Acai! You dare return?”

“Speak gently,” Guan Yu warned, a piercing glance freezing Gao Shen.

Rising, Guan Yu clasped Acai’s shoulder. “He’s under my protection now. Harass him again, and Chen Xiaona’s fate awaits. Agreed, Madam Karasi?”

Karasi weighed options—better temporary retreat than rash conflict. “If you’ve bonded, keep him. May he prosper.”

“Good. Second matter: Release all abductees here.”

Karasi’s expression hardened. “Unreasonable. Our livelihood depends on them.”

“Then we fight.” Guan Yu twirled the revolver. “Victors dictate terms.”

Karasi laughed coldly. “Must I comply? What justifies destroying our income?”

“Your new career path: prison. Three meals guaranteed—ideal retirement.”

“Who empowered this arrogance?” Karasi stood, venomous. “None leave alive today!”

“Enough chatter!” Second-to-Wolf unsheathed his blade, suffusing the room with murderous aura—pressure only a First-Class Master could wield.

Gao Shen barely dodged the first strike, a shallow cut bleeding on his chest.

“Why target ME?” he inwardly raged.

Second-to-Wolf sneered. “Disliked your face.”

Karasi paled but plotted escape. “So you seek war?”

“We’ll dismantle this trafficking den,” Guan Yu declared, lunging into combat.

As Second-to-Wolf engaged five opponents, Guan Yu fought four. Jinhua collected discarded guns while Acai battled a cosmetics-caked woman wielding giant scissors.

*Bang!*

A gunshot froze the room—Jinhua had shot the scissors-wielder mid-fight.

Chapter 2302: Blade’s Prey

Post-grenade disposal, Karasi stabilized her nerves. Escape remained feasible if combat turned dire.

“State your business,” she demanded, seated.

Guan Yu gestured Acai forward. Gao Shen recognized the traitor. “You DARE return?”

“Temper, temper.” Guan Yu’s glare paralyzed Gao Shen with spiritual pressure.

Asserting Acai’s new allegiance, Guan Yu threatened retaliation if harmed. Karasi feigned compliance, biding time.

Negotiations broke at Guan Yu’s demand to free captives—the syndicate’s lifeblood.

“Over my corpse,” Karasi hissed, revealing escape routes in her mind.

Second-to-Wolf’s blade sang, aura pinning foes. His first strike bloodied Gao Shen, who barely dodged bisection.

“Why ME?!” the wounded man internally screamed.

“Disliked your face,” the warrior taunted.

As combat erupted, Jinhua secured firearms while Acai grappled the scissor-wielder until Jinhua’s opportunistic gunshot decided the duel.

Chapter 2303: Miraculous Marksmanship

The gunshot’s echo paralyzed combatants. Jinhua stood smoking pistol in hand, the scissors-wielder collapsing.

Guan Yu seized the moment, disarming two foes with precise strikes. Second-to-Wolf’s whirlwind blade pressed five adversaries, finding weaknesses in their coordination.

Karasi edged toward an exit, halted by Guan Yu’s revolver aim. “Leaving so soon?”

The standoff held—until Second-to-Wolf’s laugh broke tension. “Enough drama!” His crescent slash disarmed three opponents simultaneously.

As weapons clattered, Guan Yu pressed Karasi: “Release them, or bleed out.”

Defeated, Karasi spat orders to free captives. The den’s fall began with that bitter concession—and Jinhua’s sly grin over her still-warm pistol.
