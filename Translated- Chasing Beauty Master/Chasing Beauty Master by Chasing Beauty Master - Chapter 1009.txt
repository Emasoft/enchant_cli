“After Flying Sky Wolf had no other choice, he took you all hostage to threaten me into handing over the treasure map. That’s exactly how things unfolded. Am I right?”

Upon hearing Guan Yu’s words, the crowd suddenly understood. It turned out Guan Yu had never been poisoned—a testament to his shrewdness.

Wei Hongwei gazed at Guan Yu with renewed admiration. “Boss, I knew as long as you’re here, we’d be safe. Honestly, my earlier scared act was all fake. Hehehe.”

This time, even Xue Jing shot Wei Hongwei a disdainful look. Without mincing words, she retorted, “Could you stop boasting? It’s unbearable.” Under Xue Jing’s scolding, Wei Hongwei didn’t dare utter a word of protest.

At that moment, a young monk entered. Though not much older, his chubby physique resembled Wei Hongwei’s, his flabby flesh wobbling as he rushed to Shen Sheng, panting. “Abbot Shen, there are many cars and people at the mountain’s base. No idea what they’re here for.”

By now, the four monks had all recovered from the poison and stood up. The temple’s rear courtyard, usually secluded, rarely saw such crowds.

Uncertain of the situation, Shen Sheng rose calmly. “Clean this place first. We’ll go investigate.”

The four monks filed out, followed by Guan Yu and the others eager to see what was happening.

From the entrance of the Compassionate Buddha Hall—the highest point of Houyuan Temple—the foot of the mountain was visible. Wei Hongwei exclaimed, “Holy shit! There are like thirty or forty vehicles climbing up, packed with people carrying weapons. What the hell are they here for?”

Guan Yu observed the scene. Ninety percent of these people were likely targeting him. The vehicles, mostly vans, revealed crowds through their open windows.

“Why such a massive group? Do they plan to tear down Houyuan Temple?” Xiao Bai suddenly produced a monocular telescope, peering through it. “They’re hostile and well-prepared. Our temple might suffer greatly today.”

“Let me see.” Guan Yu took the telescope. After a moment, he sighed. “They’re here for me. Don’t worry—I won’t let Houyuan Temple be implicated. I’ll go intercept them.”

As Guan Yu moved to leave, Xue Jing stopped him. “Guan Yu, they’ve come in force. You can’t just walk out. Who are they?”

“Right, Boss! Charging out recklessly is suicide. There are too many! What the hell do they want?” Wei Hongwei fretted.

Guan Yu’s expression remained cold. “They’re from the Feng family. That open-top sports car in the middle holds Young Master Feng. Now that the Feng family’s recovered from recent setbacks, they’ve seized this chance to ambush me here.”

“The Fengs? How could they mobilize so many so quickly?” Wei Hongwei gaped.

Guan Yu shook his head. “Others couldn’t, but the Fengs can. They’ve always prioritized security, maintaining countless guards. With Patriarch Bill’s recent support, their influence has exploded.

“Hearing I’m alone at Houyuan Temple—and that I possess a treasure map—they couldn’t resist this golden opportunity.

“Young Master Feng informed Bill Lin about ‘another treasure map lead.’ Greedy for the treasure, Bill Lin immediately dispatched men. To avoid past failures, Feng brought nearly all family guards.”

**Chapter 2580: Hold the Line**

Guan Yu rechecked through the telescope. The orderly advance suggested over two hundred people.

“We can’t endanger the temple. Let’s block their path.” As Guan Yu stepped forward again, Xue Jing pulled him back. “It’s too dangerous! You’ve already given the treasure map to Flying Sky Wolf. What will you hand over if they demand it?”

“Boss, we need a plan first!” Even Wei Hongwei urged caution.

Guan Yu reconsidered. Charging into hundreds of prepared enemies was folly. One misstep, and they’d drown him in spit.

“Brother Guan Yu,” the bearded monk interjected earnestly, “you’re our temple’s guest. We’ll stand by you against any army!”

Shen Sheng nodded. “Houyuan Temple protects its friends. We’ll fight alongside you.”

Touched by their loyalty, Guan Yu still refused to jeopardize the temple. “Is there a back exit here?”

The monks shook heads. Xiao Bai said, “Only one mountain path exists—no rear escape.”

Trapped, Guan Yu resolved to hold ground. He called for reinforcements, though help would arrive too late. The approaching vehicles already climbed halfway.

“Open the temple gates. I’ll drive my car in. Everyone—haul those red bricks inside!”

The temple’s high threshold required makeshift wooden ramps. Once Guan Yu parked inside, the group frantically carried weathered bricks from the platform into the courtyard.

Wei Hongwei’s plump frame dripped sweat as he waddled. The monks, leveraging martial arts stamina, moved swiftly. Xue Jing effortlessly tossed bricks over the wall with pinpoint accuracy.

As engines growled beyond the walls, Guan Yu shouted, “Enough! Seal the gates tightly!”

They barred the doors with thick wooden beams. Standing in the courtyard, they heard vehicles idling outside. Dozens of men now marched up the path.

Wei Hongwei, drenched in nervous sweat, whispered, “Boss, why the bricks?”

“You’ll see,” Guan Yu replied cryptically.

The悬殊 numbers terrified Wei Hongwei—seven against two hundred. Even Guan Yu and Xue Jing’s skills seemed insufficient.

**BANG! BANG! BANG!**

Someone pounded the gate. “Open up, or we break in!”

The bearded monk boomed, “The temple is closed today! Return another day!”

The pounding paused. Then Young Master Feng’s voice rang out: “We’re not pilgrims. Hand over Guan Yu, and we’ll fund your temple’s incense for life.”

Guan Yu recognized the voice instantly. “Young Master Feng! What brings you here with an entourage?”

Feng’s tone turned smug. “Guan Yu! Quit hiding! Settle this like a man without defiling holy ground!”

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “I admire your intel network. But do you truly believe numbers guarantee victory?”

Feng flinched. Past humiliations by Guan Yu haunted him. Only with Bill Lin’s backing had he dared this ambush.

“Enough games!” Feng barked. “Surrender, or we storm in!”

The bearded monk roared back, “Piss off, you money-stinking toad! We’d rather starve than deal with scum!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Such fame you’ve earned, Feng! Even mountain monks know your rotten reputation!”

Mockingly, he added, “Next time, insult him properly. His skin’s too thick for half-hearted curses!”

Unfazed, Feng shouted, “Last chance! Hand him over, or we raze this temple!”

**Chapter 2581: Fortune Follows Survival**

Guan Yu sighed theatrically. “Oh Feng, must you embarrass yourself again? How many defeats will it take?”

Feng’s voice hardened. “Today ends differently! Men—BREAK THE GATE!”
