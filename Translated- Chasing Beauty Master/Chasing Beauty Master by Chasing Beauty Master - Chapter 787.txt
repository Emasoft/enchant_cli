Guan Yu now felt relieved he had reunited with Jones a few days prior, which provided today's safeguard. Otherwise, with Sun Heizi (Black Sun) bringing so many men, he'd have no choice but to flee.

Noticing his followers' timidity, Sun Heizi bolstered his courage. "What's there to fear? They're outnumbered. Even in real combat, we might not lose." Sun Heizi had come today for a fight to the death—this day would settle their bitter feud.

"Sun Heizi," Guan Yu said with a smile, "if you want to die, don't drag these others down. They still wish to live." At that moment, voices from the Freedom Organization outside roared, "Don't let any escape! Kill them all!"

"Right! Kill them all!"

**Chapter 1996: Intimidation Tactics**

Sun Heizi had indeed come for mutual destruction. The vendetta between him and Guan Yu demanded resolution today.

"Sun Heizi," Guan Yu repeated calmly, "your death wish shouldn't include these men." Again, the Freedom Organization's shouts echoed: "Slaughter them all!"

Though the threats were bluffs, Sun Heizi's men grew visibly uneasy.

Sun Heizi's face hardened. Glaring venomously, he suddenly produced a pistol. "Let's end this today. I know you're skilled, but can you outmatch bullets?"

Guan Yu swiftly shielded Xue Jing and Jones behind him, activating his Eggshell Shield. He believed it could withstand the miniature pistol's rounds.

At five meters apart, dodging a shot would be impossible. With two women behind him, retreat wasn't an option.

"You think that flimsy shield can stop bullets?" Sun Heizi sneered, relishing Guan Yu's fading smile. "My offer stands: obey me, and I'll spare your wretched life."

"Sun Heizi," Guan Yu replied coldly, "victory is already mine. Fire that gun, and your son's safety becomes uncertain."

The black muzzle didn't faze Guan Yu, but Sun Heizi laughed mockingly. "My son? He's long overseas!"

"I know he's abroad. But have you confirmed his safety today? Call him. Now."

Guan Yu's bluff was bold—despite hours of searching, Sun Xu's whereabouts remained unknown.

Sun Heizi paled. Whether trickery or not, verifying his son's safety seemed prudent. As he hesitated, a silver dagger flashed in Guan Yu's hand under moonlight. With a flick, it pierced Sun Heizi's gun-wrist.

"AAH!" The pistol clattered as Sun Heizi clutched his bleeding wrist.

A shadow darted from behind Guan Yu—Jones seized the fallen gun, pressing it to Sun Heizi's temple before he could react. Even Guan Yu marveled at her speed.

Trembling under the cold barrel, Sun Heizi collapsed to his knees. Jones kicked him sprawling at Guan Yu's feet.

"Mercy... I beg you!" Sun Heizi whimpered.

Jones turned the gun on Li Baitian. "We've no quarrel, Li. Leave now, and choose allies wisely henceforth."

"Y-yes! Absolutely!" Li stammered, scurrying off with his men like frightened rats.

The Qinglong Organization members remained, but their leader's absence spoke volumes. Guan Yu saw no need to punish them.

"Your boss skipped this grand event?" Jones announced. "The Freedom Organization welcomes skilled异能者. Spread the word. Now leave."

As they dispersed, only Sun Heizi remained prostrate.

"Today's outcome was inevitable," Guan Yu said, crouching mockingly. "Oh, and about your son? That was a lie."

Sun Heizi gnashed his teeth. "Curse you, Guan Yu! What now?"

*SLAP!* The blow sent Sun Heizi rolling. "Your misfortune stems from opposing me. Blame your fool son for touching my woman!" A kick launched him three meters. "Where's your bravado now? I'm no saint—cross me, and suffer."

Another kick left Sun Heizi gasping. An ordinary man couldn't endure a cultivator's blows. This wasn't cruelty—it was a lesson.

"Spare me... please!" Sun Heizi begged, broken.

"Would you show mercy if our positions reversed?" Guan Yu's murderous glint faded. "Remember this. Cross me again, and your family vanishes from this earth."

Crawling away, Sun Heizi's pleas echoed. Let his private doctors tend him—Guan Yu wouldn't bother calling help.

**Chapter 1997: Drowning You**

The anticlimactic "battle" over, Guan Yu examined Sun Heizi's pistol. "My thanks, Jones. Without your aid, bloodshed was certain."

"Formalities? You're our Second-in-Command now," Jones grinned.

Guan Yu nodded gratefully. Her displayed prowess earlier might even surpass his own.

The next morning, Guan Yu skipped school to retrieve A'mei from the Yang residence. Zhang Han leapt into his arms. "Uncle! Take me out! It's boring without A'mei!"

"Behave, and I will," Guan Yu promised, enduring the girl's clinging.

After brief pleasantries, they departed. Back at Qiaoyuan Villa, Wei Hongwei called urgently: "Guan哥! Come quick—Sun Zhi's taken over Junzi Tang! They're surrounding our classroom!"

At school, Guan Yu found Sun Zhi boasting 150+ men. The confrontation halted all classes, spectators crowding windows.

Engines roared as motorcycles stormed the gates—Wang Xiaoqian led her Storm Riders, iron rods gleaming. Vehicles disgorged dozens more.

"Today, spit alone could drown you!" Sun Zhi sneered.

Guan Yu smirked. "Last night, your father's异能者lay broken at my feet. What can these drunkards do?"

Before Sun Zhi retorted, a voice thundered over engines: "Guan哥! Reinforcements here!"

Wang Hu and Wei Yong burst through the crowd with nearly 100宇帮members. The tide turned—yet Sun Zhi grinned, dialing his phone: "Yulu... transform now."

**Chapter 1998: The Idol Within**

The Storm Riders revved menacingly when Wang Hu arrived—shield activated, rural mourning clothes still on. "Just returned from Grandpa's funeral! Let's crush these bastards!"

Guan Yu's forces now numbered 100 against 200+, but his calm never wavered. Sun Zhi's smirk deepened. "Still think you'll win?"

"Numbers mean nothing." Guan Yu's aura crackled. "Your family's legacy ends today."

As Wang Xiaoqian revved forward, a deafening roar split the air. From the sky descended a crimson phoenix—its rider, Tang Wutong (Dancing Willow), Guan Yu's betrothed, Nascent Soul aura blazing.

The battlefield froze. Even Sun Zhi's hired异能者quailed before such power. Guan Yu smiled—the true game had just begun.
