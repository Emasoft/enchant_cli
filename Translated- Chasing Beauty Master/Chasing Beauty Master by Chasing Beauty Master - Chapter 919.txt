“You brat, why won’t you ever listen to your older sister? Are you trying to drive me to an early grave? I’ve told you—this situation is unlike anything before! What do you mean you want to ‘train’? This is a Western country! If the local authorities get involved, who’ll come fight you face-to-face? They’ll probably send a missile while you’re sleeping and blow your house into a crater!

When your bones are scattered to the wind, how will you resist then? Listen, I don’t care what you’re tangled up in over there. You *must* return this afternoon—no arguments. If you’re even a minute late, your eldest sister and I will come drag you back ourselves. Enough—I have a meeting. We’ll talk later.”

Xu Jinglei hung up, leaving Guan Yu both frustrated and shaken. He wasn’t overly worried about assassins—even a swarm of First-Class Supreme Experts or peak-level fighters would only tire him out. But heavy weaponry? That was another matter. Rumors claimed foreign syndicates had arms more advanced than their governments’. A sudden missile strike or aerial bomb could reduce him to ash. Truly perilous.

Of course, Xu Jinglei had no idea what Guan Yu was embroiled in. Normally, she and the others gave him freedom unless matters escalated. But this crisis had spiraled beyond control. If it were in China, they might still intervene. Yet in the distant West, even her vast influence couldn’t reach.

Guan Yu sighed heavily. Jin Hua approached. “What did the sisters say?” He shook his head wordlessly. Jin Hua realized—the only ones who could instill fear in Guan Yu were these two elusive sisters she’d never met.

Who were they? She’d glimpsed them occasionally on TV or magazines. Yet Guan Yu, of all people, trembled at their reprimands.

Since his memory loss, the Hua Yu Group’s sisters had doted on him like a child. Now, after his recklessness abroad, Xu Jinglei had confronted Xue Jing, berating her for negligence. The scolding reduced Xue Jing to tears as she apologized profusely, vowing never to repeat the mistake.

Amei, Lü Mei, and Zhang Han—all witnessing Xu Jinglei’s unprecedented fury—understood it stemmed from concern. Burdened by corporate demands, the sisters rarely monitored Guan Yu’s life, trusting loyal aides to handle minor issues. But this threat demanded intervention.

Guan Yu and Jin Hua brainstormed ways to buy two more days. “If it’s truly this dangerous,” Jin Hua urged, “let’s heed your sisters and leave this afternoon. Don’t make them worry.”

“But I’m terrified for Uncle Qing’s condition. If we miss this chance to find your Grandmaster, he might not survive the wait.”

His phone rang—Xue Jing. “Xue Jing… You’re calling to make me return too?” he said listlessly.

“Yes. You know the situation. Come home—it’s safer here.” Her voice trembled oddly.

“Xue Jing, what’s wrong? You sound hoarse.”

Zhang Han’s voice chirped in the background: “Big Brother! Elder Sister Xu scolded Xue Jing yesterday! She cried all night!”

“Hush, Hanhan!” Xue Jing snapped, sending the girl scampering upstairs.

Guan Yu winced. Xu Jinglei must have blamed Xue Jing for indulging him. Poor Xue Jing, thin-skinned by nature, couldn’t withstand such reproach.

“Don’t blame yourself,” he consoled. “This is my fault, not yours.”

“I know they’re just worried about you. No one’s angry—we’re all anxious. Please come back. Everyone in Qiaoyuan District is on edge.”

Guan Yu’s mind churned. These women’s devotion weighed on him. Xu Jinglei’s warning clarified the true danger—not just to himself, but Jin Hua too. Yet abandoning Uncle Qing felt impossible.

Jin Hua sighed. “If only Grandmaster would appear now…”

Her words sparked an idea. Why wait passively? “Let’s search for your Grandmaster immediately!”

“Where?” Jin Hua hurried after him.

“You Dun mentioned a cave on Great Northern Mountain. We’ll take him as our guide.”

Jin Hua nodded doubtfully. Five years had passed since You Dun’s account—the cave might be gone, the Grandmaster long departed. But with no alternatives, they had to try.

Guan Yu shared her pragmatism. Finding the Grandmaster meant bargaining for Uncle Qing’s treatment. Failure would mean accepting fate.

At the warehouse, Guan Yu confronted You Dun. “Lead us to Great Northern Mountain’s cave, and I’ll free you.”

“Y-Yes!”

“How long by car?”

“Two hours… roughly.”

Guan Yu tossed him into the vehicle like a sack. As they sped off, Ganbili chased after. “You’re defying your sisters?!”

“If we hurry, I can catch the afternoon flight!”

The car roared away. Following You Dun’s directions, Guan Yu slashed the travel time to ninety minutes. At the mountain’s base, he untied You Dun’s legs. “Move fast.”

The arid landscape surprised Jin Hua. “So desolate. In China, even remote mountains have foothill villages.”

You Dun gulped water thirstily. Guan Yu scanned the terrain. “Any drivable paths?”

“None I know. It’s been five years…”

They trekked uphill, spotting wild pheasants and rabbits. A white tiger eyed them but fled at Jin Hua’s feint.

Finally, they reached a boulder-blocked cave entrance. Guan Yu shouted inside—no reply. He heaved the stone aside, revealing a rodent-infested chamber long abandoned.

Defeated, they returned. Guan Yu addressed You Dun: “You’re going to the police.”

“N-No! I’ll do anything!”

“The woman you drugged was an officer. Think she’ll forgive you?”

As You Dun paled, Guan Yu relented: “But if your master contacts you, give her this.” He revealed a token. “Tell her I’ll meet any demand for her aid.”

The trio’s fruitless journey ended at the forsaken cave. Guan Yu’s hopes for Uncle Qing dimmed. Time pressed—he had to choose: risk annihilation abroad or abandon a dying man’s last hope.

Heat and thirst plagued their retreat. Back at the car, Guan Yu bound You Dun anew. “To the police—unless your master heeds my offer.”

You Dun trembled, envisioning decades lost. Yet Guan Yu’s bargain kindled fragile hope. As the engine roared homeward, uncertainty loomed—would the Grandmaster emerge, or had fate already sealed Uncle Qing’s doom?
