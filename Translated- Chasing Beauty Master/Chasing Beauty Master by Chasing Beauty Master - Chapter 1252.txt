Guan Yu was indeed quite hungry. Upon arriving at the kitchen, he found Xiaodong tidying up. Now able to communicate simply through gestures, Guan Yu motioned his needs. Xiaodong nodded understandingly and gestured for him to wait outside.

**Chapter 3218: A Favor to Ask**

In the backyard’s small pavilion stood a stone table with round stone stools. Guan Yu hesitated whether to sit. One could eat standing—no need to endure the discomfort. Though the pain from last night had subsided, the hurried journey with Xiaochun and Xiaolian, who showed no consideration for his condition, had aggravated his injury.

After traversing Tiger’s Head Peak, the pain intensified. If this persisted, he’d have to ask Xiaodong for medicinal ointment. The ordeal was becoming unbearable.

Soon, Xiaodong arrived with a steaming bowl of noodles, placing it on the stone table with a smile.

Guan Yu thanked him and began eating standing up. Xiaodong watched curiously—why forgo the stools? Was it their hardness, coldness, or dirtiness?

After the meal, Guan Yu returned to the Ancestral Hall’s main chamber. Finding Elder Jiu, he awkwardly said, “Elder Jiu, I have a... favor to ask.”

“Speak freely,” replied Elder Jiu without opening his eyes.

“Well... last night, I accidentally injured myself while... using the latrine. It’s painful to even sit. I heard you have medicinal herbs. Might there be something to treat this?”

Expecting mockery, Guan Yu was surprised when Elder Jiu calmly remarked, “Tearing oneself with ink-paper at your age? You’re clearly not from this world.”

Here, using ink-paper for hygiene was considered refined. Most endured such injuries since childhood, building tolerance over time. Guan Yu’s vulnerability marked him as an outsider.

Summoning Xiaodong, Elder Jiu gestured instructions. Guan Yu realized medicine was being prepared. Only Elder Jiu could convey such specifics through their gestural language.

“Rest today,” Elder Jiu advised. “If urgent matters arise, descend via the rear mountain path.”

Kneeling before the ancestral tablets, Guan Yu meditated as time flowed swiftly.

**Interlude: The Persistent Suitors**

Dai Shouzhuo of Assembly Peak visited Front Return Peak frequently these days, much to Lu Shouzhuo’s annoyance. Her ostensible reason—gifting rare delicacies—masked deeper intentions.

One evening over drinks, Lu confided in Jinciyu Lang (“Second Only to Wolf”): “Brother, why do you think Dai Shouzhuo keeps visiting? Those Assembly Peak specialties she brings—even I can’t obtain them normally! A single fruit costs me twenty chickens!”

Jinciyu Lang chuckled. “Immortal cultivators have two lives when bonded to a Guardian. You covet my cultivation strength—this is obvious.”

Lu started, sobering slightly. “You knew? After losing Guan Yu to the Sect Leader despite offering two magical artifacts, I can’t afford more losses.”

“Guan Yu remains my charge,” Jinciyu Lang stated. “Enhancing his power benefits me. My... vital interests are tied to him.” The unspoken reference was to Yingzi, his beloved.

Lu persisted: “Among Six Peaks, my cultivation ranks second only to the Sect Leader. Name any condition.”

“Let’s drink,” deflected Jinciyu Lang. “I’ll never be a cultivator’s Guardian.”

**Chapter 3219: Astonishing Coincidence**

Discussing Cloud Azure Sect’s geography, Jinciyu Lang mused: “Your seven peaks remind me of China’s ‘Gourd Boys’ legend—seven heroic brothers turned mountains.”

Lu roared with laughter. “We actually have seven peaks! The Ancestral Hall’s mountain, hidden from common view, makes the seventh. Legend says our peaks embody those very heroes!”

Jinciyu Lang marveled at the coincidence, half-wondering if they might unearth gourd-shaped artifacts someday.

**Meanwhile Elsewhere...**

Guan Yu emerged from seclusion with Emperor’s Seal fully charged—three attack spells (two advanced, one supreme) and one supreme defense spell. Now, even Sect Leader Xuan Ming wouldn’t easily best him.

Yet his Sword Flight Technique progress frustrated him. “Master, my spiritual energy vanishes when channeled!”

Xuan Ming laughed. “Foolish disciple! You’ve been storing energy in Fallen Soul Blade without knowing retrieval methods!”

Realization dawned—the blade required personalized activation commands. Guan Yu’s despair turned to exhilaration. The path to power remained open!

**Epilogue: Lingering Threads**

Lin Qiaoqiao wandered A City like a ghost, Guan Yu’s absence draining her spirit. Visits to Xue Jing and plans to aid relatives in Yangcheng barely masked her emptiness.

At Cloud Azure Sect, Guan Yu’s fingers tightened around Fallen Soul Blade. With Emperor’s Seal’s might and newfound understanding, the world would soon witness his resurgence.
