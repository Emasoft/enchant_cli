Zou Wuhui furrowed her brows and glanced at the Prince before saying, “My lord, let me go check. Second Brother has surely gone looking for wine.” The Prince waved his hand dismissively. “Leave him be. Let’s eat first. He’ll return once he’s had his fill.”

Something was clearly amiss. Zou Wuxiao had unmistakably gone to the back earlier, and the premises were small—only this main room and an inner chamber. Everyone had seen him enter, yet the proprietor now claimed not to have seen him. Stranger still, no sound had emerged from Zou Wuxiao’s direction.

The Prince pondered: even if Zou Wuxiao had been ambushed, there should have been some commotion. Yet they’d heard nothing. The situation grew more perplexing by the moment.

With their already diminished numbers, the Prince couldn’t afford to lose more men one by one. Resolving to eat first, he thought coldly of Zou Wuxiao: if the disobedient fool died, so be it. If he survived, punishment awaited him regardless.

Zou Wuhui’s concern, however, was genuine. As the proprietor interjected, “Please enjoy your meal, honored guests. Call if you need anything,” she remained troubled.

Just as the man turned to leave, the Prince commanded, “Proprietor, your dishes seem excellent. Prepare more for our journey. Also, one of my servants went to the back earlier. Kindly locate him and convey that we depart soon.”

“At once, sir!” The proprietor bowed with a smile.

Once he left, the Prince nodded to one of his captains, signaling him to investigate. The warrior slipped away to search for the missing man, inwardly cursing Zou Wuxiao for causing trouble at such a critical juncture.

The group ate hungrily, practicality overriding worry. Though anxious about her brother, Zou Wuhui reassured martial prowess could martial prowess could withstand any ambush. She remained alert, ready to charge in at the first sign of disturbance.

The captain navigated the short corridor connecting the buildings. In the rear kitchen, he found only stored vegetables and the proprietor washing produce. No exits. No Zou Wuxiao.

“Are there other exits here?” the captain demanded.

The proprietor turned with a smile. “None. Why come here? Did you drink the wine from my table?”

Following his gaze, the captain noticed the empty wine jug still warm to the touch. “I entered after you,” he countered. “No time to drink.” Privately, he suspected the wine-loving Zou Wuxiao had stolen a draught.

But where was the man now? With no exits, had he hidden to drink more? The Prince’s wrath would be fierce if they returned empty-handed.

Back in Liaozhou’s princely manor, all knew Zou Wuxiao’s drunken escapades earned constant reprimands—briefly effective at best.

The proprietor suddenly offered, “Travel-weary guests should refresh with wine! Let me pour you—”

“I abstain,” the captain snapped, turning to leave. A blur struck his eyes. His legs buckled, consciousness fading as he collapsed.

The Prince continued dining calmly. When Zou Wuhui grew restless—“My lord, neither Second Brother nor Third Captain have returned!”—he raised a placating hand. “Compose yourself. They’ve likely met trouble. Prepare for combat.”

His choice of the teetotal Third Captain had been deliberate—a counter to Zou Wuxiao’s weakness. Their silent disappearance confirmed treachery. They’d stumbled into a den of thieves.

The proprietor reappeared bearing steaming buns. “Sustenance for your journey! Your men enjoy my wine too much—fetch them before they’re too drunk.”

“Both drinking?” the Prince inquired coolly.

“Indeed, reveling heartily!”

With a metallic shing, Zou Wuhui’s blade flashed toward the proprietor’s heart. The man flipped backward like paper in wind, landing gracefully distant, features twisted in a sinister grin.

Three previously seated patrons rose to flank him. The Prince realized their predicament: outnumbered, poisoned, with two men still missing. Only four opponents, but...

Zou Wuhui whispered urgently, “My lord, let Captain escort you out. I’ll handle this.”

She assessed correctly—these weren’t their usual pursuers from the bamboo forest ambushes. Roadside bandits, perhaps, but motives unclear: robbery? Murder?

The Prince’s party would yield neither. Zou Wuhui leveled her sword. “Vermin! Dare target His Highness? Know you who stands before you?”

“Who cares?” the leader sneered. “Leave woman and wealth. Men may flee—or die.”

“Release our men, and live,” Zou Wuhui threatened. “Else, perish.”

Mocking laughter answered. “Foolish girl! You’ve eaten my poison. Feel your strength fading?”

Horror dawned. The silver needle tests had failed—the toxin required combining food and tea. Internal energy use accelerated its spread.

The Prince’s mind raced. Bandits wanted wealth and women—perhaps negotiable. “I am Prince Zou of Liaozhou. Spare us, and I’ll reward you handsomely.”

“Prince? I’m the Emperor!” the leader spat. “Surrender valuables and the woman. Now.”

Defiance met royal status. The Prince seethed—Zou Wuxiao’s folly had distracted them from thorough poison checks.

Weakened, the Prince slumped in his chair. Zou Wuhui cried, “My lord!”

“Go... while you can,” he gasped. “The poison strengthens.”

“But Second Brother—”

“Would you trade yourself? Go!”

The head captain roared, suppressing the toxin to charge. Steel clashed as others helped the Prince retreat. But the bandits gave chase.

Despite valor, poisoned warriors faltered. The captain fell to kicks; another spat blood and teeth. Cornered, surrender became inevitable.

Bound in the back room, the Prince’s group was stripped of possessions—even his fine robes. The bandits cursed finding only official banknotes unusable without palace seals.

“Useless!” the leader growled. “Can’t cash these without the Prince’s mark.”

A bearded bandit leered at Zou Wuhui. “Keep the fiery wench then!”

The Prince glared at unconscious Zou Wuxiao—source of this disaster. Outside, lackeys ransacked their carriage.

Zou Wuhui spat defiance: “Harm the Prince, and face imperial wrath!”

The leader laughed. “Escaped convicts fear nothing. Death holds no terror.”

As discussions turned grim, the Prince assessed their bleak options. Survival hung by a thread in this lawless den.
