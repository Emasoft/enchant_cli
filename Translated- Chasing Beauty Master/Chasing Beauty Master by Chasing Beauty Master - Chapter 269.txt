“Guan Yu’s gaze made Chen Bao deeply uncomfortable. This feeling was something he’d encountered in many dangerous figures before, but he never expected to sense it in a youth younger than himself. He tried harder to believe it was an illusion.

The room was small. A single glance revealed how many people were inside.

When Chen Bao realized the other side had only two people while his own group had eight, his confidence grew.

He puffed out his chest and said arrogantly, “That’s right. I brought Liu Jie in. Got a problem with that?”

Guan Yu smiled faintly, his eyes turning colder.

“Brother Bao, you’re here!” Liu Jie clung to Chen Bao like a lifeline, exclaiming, “Teach this guy a lesson!”

Chen Bao glanced at Liu Jie’s swollen face and nodded. “I’m here to solve your problem. But don’t forget your promise. Cross me, and I’ll skin you alive.”

Compared to Guan Yu’s slaps, Liu Jie feared his “Brother Bao” more. He nodded obsequiously. “Don’t worry. After this, I’ll treat all you brothers to drinks.”

“Is that all?” Chen Bao glared.

Liu Jie cowered. “Brother Bao, I’d never forget you wanting to be friends with my sister. Deal with this punk, and I’ll get her to dine with you tomorrow.”

Chen Bao’s eyes glinted with lust. He turned to Guan Yu, ready to issue threats—comply with compensation and hospitalization, or suffer worse.

But fate had other plans.

Before Chen Bao could speak, a searing pain exploded in his chest. Crack. Ribs fractured.

Guan Yu’s kick sent Chen Bao crashing to the floor, vomiting blood. His glare burned with venomous hate.

“Send them all to the hospital,” Guan Yu said coldly.

Lin Dong rose lazily, cracking melon seeds as he approached the seven thugs. With casual flicks, seeds embedded in their faces like shrapnel. Screams filled the room.

In under a minute, all seven writhed on the ground. Lin Dong resumed cracking seeds, muttering, “Disgusting.”

Guan宇 observed Liu Jie trembling in the corner. “You call yourself a gangster? If real fighting broke out, you’d piss yourself or die first.”

Liu Jie scrambled for the door, but Guan宇 hauled him back. “You stay. The show isn’t over.”

Twenty minutes later, reinforcements arrived—tougher men with hardened faces. Chen Bao pointed accusingly. “Boss! These are the bastards who did this!”

Zhao Hu, White Tiger Gang leader, studied the calm young man on the sofa. “You’re the one who hurt my men?”

Guan宇 met his gaze. “Your man targeted my woman. That debt needs settling.”

“You’re that Guan Yu?” Zhao Hu’s eyes widened. “The one who dominated N City’s underworld?”

Guan宇’s smile turned icy. “Let’s be civilized. Your thug threatened my woman. How shall we resolve this?”

The room tensed. Zhao Hu clenched his fists, weighing options. Against this legend, even the White Tiger Gang might break.
