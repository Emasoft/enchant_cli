The crowd around gasped, shrinking back and hurriedly closing their eyes! This enormous dog would surely tear that delicate girl to shreds! Several burly men grabbed stones from the ground, shouting curses as they prepared to charge forward for rescue!

Yet Guan Yu moved faster. Activating his gravity system, he became a blur—each stride covered over two meters as his legs churned through air, feet barely discernible against the pavement.

The gravity system worked wonders. Every explosive leap felt weightless, his body slicing through wind like an arrow. In mere seconds, he'd crossed over ten meters.

As the Tibetan Mastiff lunged with bloodied jaws toward Du Xiaojuan's face, Guan Yu pivoted sharply. His legs coiled like springs before launching him spinning through air like a top, hurtling straight for the beast's chain!

This was the definition of split-second timing. Du Xiaojuan could already see the glistening fangs, lolling tongue, and mottled black lips rushing toward her. Screaming, she covered her face and collapsed into a crouch.

The mastiff's massive paws had just brushed her shoulders when Guan Yu's hand closed around its chain.

Gravity suddenly intensified. Guan Yu crashed to the pavement even as he yanked the chain with desperate strength. From his prone position, he whipped the hundred-pound beast through air like a flail. The flailing dog smashed against roadside concrete with a sickening crunch!

Without pause, Guan Yu rolled sideways. Before fully rising, he dropped into a simian crouch and exploded forward, charging at Du Xiaojuan like a silverback gorilla!

Still crouched in terror, Du Xiaojuan barely registered the chaos before Guan Yu scooped her up. With her clamped under one arm, he vaulted over a roadside flowerbed and sprinted across the street!

The dazed mastiff shook off debris, eyes blazing crimson. Dragging its clanking chain, it barreled after the fleeing pair. Bystanders tentatively reached for the chain but recoiled—none dared provoke the enraged beast further.

Well-meaning drivers tried blocking the mastiff's path, but it darted between vehicles with terrifying agility. Though Guan Yu's initial burst had outsped the dog, carrying Du Xiaojuan now nullified his advantage. As snapping jaws closed in, Guan Yu abruptly pivoted mid-stride, reversing direction to charge straight back at his pursuer!

The mastiff couldn't match this sudden maneuver. Momentum carried it skidding eight meters across asphalt before it could wheel around. Seizing this reprieve, Guan Yu adjusted his gravity system and bounded onto a sedan's hood, then vaulted to its roof—a mere meter above ground, easily within the mastiff's leaping range.

Planting his feet in a combat stance atop the trembling vehicle, Guan Yu clutched Du Xiaojuan while tracking the circling beast below. "Drive! Now!" onlookers suddenly shouted, realizing his plan.

The sedan lurched forward cautiously, edging mere meters through gridlocked traffic. It was enough. Guan Yu sprang sideways, aiming for a bus roof. Even gravity-lightened, his burdened leap fell short. One hand clawed the bus's edge, leaving them dangling from a single arm!

Below, the mastiff's howls turned feral. Blue fire flickered in its eyes as it gathered for a final leap. Claws raked upward toward Guan Yu's legs while jaws snapped for flesh!

In that instant, Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. He activated gravity manipulation on the beast.

**Chapter 28: Instant KO**

Golden light flashed through his mind as dual gravity systems overloaded. The pouncing mastiff jerked mid-air as if yanked backward, crashing down hard!

Confused, the beast whipped its head around seeking invisible attackers. This momentary distraction let Guan Yu hurl Du Xiaojuan onto the bus roof.

"Fucking brat! Let my Duke bite you!" screamed a pockmarked man in his twenties, crew-cut hair bristling. His muscular companion charged forward, fists clenched.

Guan Yu snorted. Duke? More like demon hound. Typical owner reflecting his beast's nature.

As Guan Yu scrambled upward, the mastiff—egged on by its master's shouts—renewed its assault. Jaws clamped on his sneaker's sole, foam crunching between teeth. A half-second slower and his ankle would've shattered!

"Chew it up! I'll pay the damn medical bill!" the crew-cut man crowed. Guan Yu's grip slipped as the thrashing dog pulled downward.

"Think you can fly, asshole?" the owner jeered. "Surrender and maybe Duke will—"

His taunt died as Guan Yu suddenly released his hold. Mid-fall, he twisted and—with gravity-enhanced force—kicked the mastiff's belly three times in two seconds! The final stomp crushed the beast's muzzle against pavement, sending it yelping across the road!

"You dare hurt my Duke?!" The owner charged, only for Guan Yu to intercept him. A single neck grab sent the man crashing skull-first into asphalt, writhing like a stunned insect. His muscular friend fared worse—a flurry of punches left him nose-shattered and bleeding on the ground.

Cheers erupted. "Serve them right!" an Audi driver shouted. "Kill that monster dog!" others added.

Ignoring the bloodthirsty suggestions, Guan Yu turned to the bus roof. "You! Get down now before police arrive!"

Du Xiaojuan peered over the edge. "It's... high..."

"Jump. I'll catch you."

Her skirt fluttered as she hesitated. From below, Guan Yu glimpsed white cotton briefs—another accidental peepshow. He mentally cursed his recent streak of awkward encounters.

The gravity system cushioned her fall into his arms. "Run!" he urged, dragging her through the traffic maze.

"Thank you," she whispered, blushing as she tried withdrawing her hand.

"Save it. My phone. Now."

"It's in my dorm! Let me explain—"

Guan Yu glared. Last time her "innocent" act cost him his phone. Never again.

"Your father called," she added quickly. "I said you'd arrived safely. You should contact him."

He sighed. At least she hadn't blown his cover. "Just return it today."

"I will! But first..." She checked her watch. "I'm meeting friends. After that—"

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. More stalling tactics?

"Please? I'll find you tonight!" Her wide eyes glittered with cartoonish innocence. Too pure for this world—or masterful deception?

**Chapter 29: Empty Pockets**

As they walked, Guan Yu noted his ruined sneakers. Du Xiaojuan followed his gaze. "Let me buy you new ones!"

"Just the phone." He couldn't afford complications if police came. Or medical bills if those thugs sued.

When she finally left, Guan Yu checked his wallet—three crumpled bills remaining. Campus cafeteria meals for a week, maybe. Another reason to avoid authorities.

He shook his head. Rescuing damsels in distress didn't pay well. Especially when said damsel remained an adorable enigma—part klutzy angel, part phone-snatching gremlin. Only time would tell which side prevailed.
