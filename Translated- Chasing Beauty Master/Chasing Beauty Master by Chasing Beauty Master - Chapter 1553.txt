After returning, Xuan Ming chose not to go to Tiger Head Peak's main hall but directly brought Chief Seat Lu to his study. Placing the iron stones on the table, Xuan Ming said, "Chief Seat Lu, you must know these iron stones are exceptionally valuable. Even if outsiders wished to buy them with silver, they might not succeed. Who would have thought that rascal Guan Yu managed to obtain so many? These feel more precious than chests of gold.

"Select two pieces now. Take them back to refine a couple of decent magic tools for your disciples. But remember, Junior Brother Lu—I never gave you any iron stones. If asked, you must say Guan Yu himself provided them. Otherwise, if other chief seats discover this, I'll face difficulties explaining."

"Of course I understand," Chief Seat Lu replied cheerfully. "For the Sect Leader to grant me two iron stones is extraordinary favor. On behalf of my disciples, I thank you here." His heart swelled with satisfaction—Xuan Ming wasn't as stingy as he'd feared. "Then, Sect Leader, I'll choose without hesitation."

Chief Seat Lu, however, didn't greedily pick the largest pieces. Instead, he selected two medium-sized stones with the finest apparent quality. Having rarely encountered iron stones before—extremely rare and seldom seen over long periods—he couldn't discern their true grade. Yet Guan Yu had previously gifted him two excellent pieces, so he trusted Guan Yu's judgment. He chose two stones resembling those in color and texture, confident they'd be comparable.

Xuan Ming watched curiously, unable to fathom why Chief Seat Lu selected those particular stones with such care. The Sect Leader himself couldn't distinguish the iron stones' quality.

"Junior Brother Lu, do you understand iron stones?" Xuan Ming inquired. "You chose so deliberately—can you assess their purity?"

"Not at all," Chief Seat Lu shook his head. "I picked these simply because they looked pleasing. My choice was random—I know nothing of their purity."

"Just as I thought," Xuan Ming nodded. "These are too rarely encountered. Our knowledge comes only from sparse records. However, Elder Jiu in the back mountains will surely understand."

"Indeed. Elder Jiu's vast experience could shed light," Chief Seat Lu agreed. "During his years traveling the jianghu, he must have encountered such materials."

"Precisely," Xuan Ming said. "Years ago, Elder Jiu refined a high-grade magic tool from an unknown material—an artifact that made everyone covetous."

"I remember that well," Chief Seat Lu said admiringly. "That tool, later named 'Celestial Terrace,' now empowers Little Dong to rival even Guan Yu's Soulfall Blade. In all Cloud Azure Sect's history, only one such high-grade artifact exists. Elder Jiu is truly remarkable."

"Which is why we must consult him," Xuan Ming concluded. "He'll know how best to utilize these iron stones. When shall we go?"

"Immediately." Xuan Ming stored two stones on his person, locking the rest in a cabinet. For refining, two sufficed—one primary, one auxiliary. As they departed, he remarked, "If Elder Jiu agrees to refine them, splendid. If not, we'll still gain valuable insights."

"Guidance is paramount," Chief Seat Lu agreed. "Experience matters greatly—that's why I encourage disciples to travel. Without knowledge, treasures like these stones might be overlooked. That scoundrel Guan Yu stumbled upon this fortune—how enviable!"

"Five million taels for armor embedded with these stones..." Xuan Ming chuckled. "An astronomical sum, yet worthwhile. Since arriving, Guan Yu has solved many problems while causing others. Yet Cloud Azure Gate feels incomplete without him."

"Truthfully, I share that sentiment," Chief Seat Lu laughed. "We've grown fond of him. Though stubborn, he only resists injustice. We've grown accustomed to his presence—he's become indispensable."

"You've deepened in wisdom, Junior Brother," Xuan Ming said. "Guan Yu's temperament... doesn't it remind you of someone? Such familiarity after long absence..."

"Sect Leader... are you speaking of Master?" Chief Seat Lu frowned. "Let's not revisit the past. Yet Guan Yu does resemble him."

"Ah... Master self-destructed for the sect's sake." Xuan Ming's voice thickened with emotion. "Our childish mischief caused that tragedy... I can never escape this regret."

"Enough years have passed," Chief Seat Lu comforted. "Master would be proud seeing Cloud Azure Sect remain preeminent."

Reaching the Ancestral Hall in the back mountains, Chief Seat Lu knocked. The doors swung open through Elder Jiu's spiritual power.

"Unexpected guests," Elder Jiu mused as Little Dong prepared tea. "State your purpose—you don't visit without cause."

Entering, the pair bowed. "Elder Jiu, we've brought something for your appraisal." Xuan Ming presented the stones.

Elder Jiu immediately recognized them. "Iron Stones—raw and unprocessed. Where did Guan Yu acquire these?"

"Through happenstance," Xuan Ming explained. "More exist—Chief Seat Xiang and Lu have some too. These two are for you."

"Remarkable," Elder Jiu marveled. "Such quantity is unheard of. Tell me everything."

As Xuan Ming recounted Guan Yu's dealings, Elder Jiu's interest grew. "That boy constantly surprises. These stones vary in purity—Chief Seat Lu's choices are superior."

"Pure luck!" Chief Seat Lu insisted, though Xuan Ming eyed him skeptically.

Elder Jiu examined the stones. "Guan Yu's discovery is extraordinary. Now, explain precisely how he obtained these..."
