Lan Yu, seeing the situation, reached out to take the orange, her little face beaming like a flower-covered kitten. She bounced over, split the fruit in half, and handed a portion back to Guan Yu.

“Thank you.” Guan Yu politely began eating.

Madame Lan nudged Lan Yunxiang. The man cleared his throat and said, “Ahem, Guan Yu, since you’ve come today as a guest, we ought to treat you with courtesy. But I must speak bluntly upfront.” He paused deliberately.

Guan Yu replied, “Speak freely. Having come here, I’ve long prepared myself.”

Lan Yunxiang nodded. “Good. The truth is, my Yu’er is already betrothed. Her fiancé is a business associate of mine from an exceedingly well-connected family.” He lifted his teacup for a sip, awaiting Guan Yu’s reaction.

Guan Yu showed none, instead watching Lan Yu’s response. Madame Lan sat nearby, brows slightly furrowed. Her heart ached—her beloved daughter was to marry a man in his fifties, a desperate choice with no alternatives. The thought left her distraught, aging her prematurely with worry.

Lan Yu, as expected, could no longer contain herself. Yet she remained calm, for Guan Yu had promised to prevent this marriage.

“Old Lan,” she said, “are you trying to sell me off? If sacrificing me truly secures your success, I suppose I’ll have to resign myself.”

Both Guan Yu and her parents were stunned. Was she agreeing?

Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated Lan Yu tossing the dilemma back to him. *This clever little imp.* He remarked, “Before coming, I learned you intend to wed her to an old man. Though I’ve never met him, I guarantee he’s no match for me.”

Lan Yunxiang sipped his tea silently. Guan Yu pressed on, “To trade your only daughter’s lifelong happiness for any cause—big or small—marks you as an unfit father.”

The room froze. Lan Yu and her mother gaped, astonished by Guan Yu’s direct rebuke. Unfazed, Guan Yu plucked a strawberry and savored it leisurely.

Lan Yunxiang’s temper flared at the audacity of this “ignorant youth,” yet he restrained himself. “You’re right,” he admitted. “As a father, I’ve failed. But circumstances forced my hand…”

Guan Yu cut him off. “There’s no ‘forcing’ a man of your experience. Decades in business, weathering storms—you shouldn’t burden a child with your troubles.”

“I know!” Lan Yunxiang exclaimed. “But the demand came from *them*. I had no choice!”

“‘No choice’?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Do those words solve anything? Feed anyone? Only the weak utter them.” Fearless by nature, he’d never cower before some businessman.

Lan Yunxiang, though insulted as “weak,” held his tongue. Guan Yu mused, *He’s truly desperate. A man of his composure wouldn’t offer his daughter as a bargaining chip unless all hope was lost.*

“Guan Yu,” Lan Yunxiang said, “you’re too young to understand true hardship—”

“Have you heard of Huayu Group?” Guan Yu interjected rudely.

Lan Yunxiang’s eyes lit with sudden hope. A business genius himself, he answered, “Huayu? A top-five national conglomerate based in Y City. We once sought collaboration, but they deemed our projects insufficiently profitable.”

In business circles, Huayu was legendary—a towering tree countless enterprises clamored to climb.

“The Lan family’s timber enterprise,” Guan Yu proposed. “If absorbed under Huayu’s banner, would Lan Yu still need to marry that old man? With me, she’ll find happiness.” He glanced at Lan Yu, whose flushed face bloomed with joy.

“Can you truly make this happen?” Lan Yunxiang doubted.

Guan Yu dialed Xue Jing on speakerphone. The moment she answered, she berated him: “You spendthrift! Skipping school again to chase skirts?”

Mortified before the Lans, Guan Yu awkwardly scratched his ear while Lan Yu whistled innocently.

**Chapter 1824: My Word Is Law**

Xue Jing’s outburst left Guan Yu thoroughly embarrassed. “Jingjing, enough,” he said. “I plan to merge Lan Timber into Huayu. They’ll operate independently under our name. Feasible?”

“Lan Timber? Reputable, but Huayu already has wood divisions. Why help them?”

“They need Huayu’s protection. Must I consult the sisters?”

“Help them if you wish. As Huayu’s Chairman, *you* decide.”

The Lans gasped, Xue Jing’s words echoing: *“You’re Huayu’s Chairman. Your word is law.”*

“Notify the sisters,” Guan Yu instructed. “The Lan chairman will visit Huayu tomorrow.” Hanging up, he faced a thunderstruck Lan Yunxiang.

“Guan Yu… Yes! Half a year ago, Huayu’s new Chairman was named Guan Yu! How did I forget?” He smacked his forehead.

Madame Lan added, “Who’d imagine the Chairman attends high school? This would make headlines!”

Guan Yu handed Lan Yunxiang an ID. “Present this at Huayu tomorrow. It’ll confirm everything.”

Madame Lan read the name: “Guan Yunchang! The Chairman renowned for peerless martial prowess!”

Convinced, Lan Yunxiang bowed. “How can I repay this grace? You, who have everything…”

“No repayment needed.” Guan Yu smiled. “I’m your son-in-law.”

Lan Yu hugged his arm, planting a kiss on his cheek. “See, Old Lan? Your daughter bagged Huayu’s Chairman! Who else could?”

Guan Yu said, “I’ve kept my promise. Now obey your parents.”

Lan Yunxiang sighed. “I’ve spoiled her—wild and impudent. If she vexes you…”

“I adore her boldness. Fate brought us together.”

Lan Yu added, “That old man’s thugs tried kidnapping me! Guan Yu saved me—or I’d be his ghostly plaything!”

Her father paled. “You’d have stayed safe home if not for your recklessness! Thank heavens for Chairman Guan!”

“Call me Guan Yu. ‘Chairman’ feels odd.”

“Then address me as Uncle Lan.”

*Damn. Demoted a generation,* Guan Yu inwardly grumbled.

**Chapter 1825: Flower Night Club**

After the hearty farewells, Guan Yu wandered aimlessly. Bored, he called Pan Xiaoxia: “Teacher Pan, how’s your health?”

“Recovered, thanks to you!”

As dusk fell, Wei Hongwei called: “Brother Guan! Han Qiao’s at Flower Night Club. My dad’s source swears it’s reliable.”

“Your ‘reliable’ track record worries me.”

“Just check! I’ll pick you up.”

En route, Guan Yu asked about the club.

“Only A-list elites go there—owned by Yang Conghan, ice queen of the Four Great Families. Cold as her name, but the city’s top beauty.”

“Four Families?”

“Yang, Ran, Feng, Lü. Lü Mei’s family is one. Yang’s club draws nobles and admirers nightly.”

At the club’s entrance, hostile glares met Guan Yu. Inside, lavish decor featured aquatic tanks lining glass walls.

Wei Hongwei whispered, “Yang Conghan’s untouchable. Even legends frequent here.”

Guan Yu smirked. *Let’s see what this “ice queen” hides.*
