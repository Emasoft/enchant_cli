The matter, in essence, was a favorable one. Given the martial world’s traditional preference for sons over daughters, the villagers here had long discovered a grave consequence over time.

As girls became exceedingly rare and only boys remained in the village, young men found themselves unable to secure wives upon reaching adulthood. Gradually, they began venturing outward, and thus tales of this place spread beyond, reaching the ears of outsiders.

Upon hearing these accounts, a steady stream of people arrived—mostly youths or newlywed couples—all hoping to bear children here, particularly twin sons, for everyone desired twin heirs.

Thus, through repeated comings and goings, the village’s population swelled. Many who came chose to settle, and Twin Sons City grew increasingly renowned. Stories of women giving birth to twin boys spread far and wide, reaching every corner.

As the population expanded, the village transformed dramatically, drawing ever more attention until it gradually evolved into the city now known as Twin Sons City.

Later, it was said the reason women here bore twin sons lay in the river flowing through the land—the Twin Sons River. Prolonged consumption of its waters was believed to produce this effect.

Now a bustling metropolis teeming with residents, Xiao Wu led the group to seek lodging. Dismounting, Guan Yu approached Jiang Yuan Kai’s carriage and said, “Brother Jiang, let us rest here tonight. The sky threatens rain, and pressing onward would be unwise.”

“I agree,” Jiang Yuan Kai replied. “That’s why I sent Xiao Wu to secure rooms. Though we’ve traveled but half a day, this carriage has jostled me to the brink of collapse. My frail condition... it grieves me deeply.”

“Take heart, Brother Jiang. Your health will mend in time,” Guan Yu reassured, though privately he had chosen to stop chiefly to spare Jiang Yuan Kai further strain, knowing his weakened state could not endure prolonged travel.

The pretext of impending rain masked this intention. Twin Sons City offered decent lodgings where Jiang Yuan Kai might recuperate properly.

Spanning the river that bisected its heart, the prosperous city boasted stone bridges erected at intervals, connecting both banks seamlessly. The lively streets buzzed with activity as Jiang Yuan Kai retired to the inn.

Noticing Guan Yu alone, Duan Ruxue approached. “How fares Jiang Yuan Kai? His pallor remains concerning.”

“The potent venom has infiltrated his heart and lungs after that fierce battle,” Guan Yu replied. “Full recovery will take time.”

Glancing about, Duan Ruxue lowered her voice. “Given his state, shouldn’t he return home? This arduous journey benefits neither his health nor injuries.”

Guan Yu studied her, sensing ulterior motives. “The Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl remains with Brother Jiang. Without him, our quest for the Eastern Sea treasures falters, even if we reach the waters.”

Duan Ruxue arched a brow. “You share such camaraderie with His Highness the Imperial Son-in-Law. Why not request the Pearl? Then our path clears.”

“Even close bonds have limits. Seek it yourself if you dare. Present any demands you wish—provided Brother Jiang consents.”

“I shan’t bother,” Duan Ruxue sniffed, knowing full well neither she nor Guan Yu could claim the priceless artifact. None would relinquish such treasure, regardless of kinship.

“Have you considered,” she pressed, “that dragging Jiang Yuan Kai along invites endless trouble? Once word spreads of his vulnerability, countless foes will descend upon us.”

Guan Yu had long contemplated this. Though dangers loomed, he refused to seize the Pearl by force. Come what may, he would shield Jiang Yuan Kai.

“From our departure in the capital,” Guan Yu countered, “you understood every member remains essential. United, we face whatever perils arise. Abandon further schemes—even with the Pearl, your Duan Clan lacks the means to claim the Eastern Sea’s riches.”

Duan Ruxue’s lips thinned. “You mistake me. I seek only to avoid complications. Rest assured—I know better than to cross the Imperial Son-in-Law lightly.”

“As companions, I’ll defend any among us without hesitation,” Guan Yu declared, though noting her veiled ambitions. He trusted her to grasp the folly of antagonizing Jiang Yuan Kai without weighing the Duan Clan’s strength against his influence.

After days of scant rest and bland provisions, Qiqi and Duan Ruxue rejoiced at finally indulging in proper fare. As the three women dined, Guan Yu kept watch nearby, vigilant against threats.

Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi ate with restraint, but the latter devoured her meal voraciously, grease smearing her cheeks and meat clinging to her clothes—an unseemly spectacle she ignored blissfully.

The inn door creaked open. From their second-floor perch, Guan Yu spotted a familiar figure—Yan Zhao. “What brings that cur here?” he muttered.

The treacherous snake, who’d nearly slain Xiao Zhi and fled to the Demonic Soul Sect, now stood below. Had he come for Jiang Yuan Kai? Unease prickled Guan Yu’s spine. While confident against ordinary martial artists, cultivators posed unpredictable threats—especially through underhanded means.

“Xiaorong,” Guan Yu called, pointing downward. “Your family’s hound approaches.”

Wang Xiaorong peered over, disgust twisting her features. “That vile creature? His presence bodes ill. How Father tolerates him baffles me.”

Having failed to eliminate Yan Zhao previously, Guan Yu resolved to finish the task. “His arrival heralds trouble. I’ll intercept him. Return to your rooms after dining.”

Descending swiftly, Guan Yu confronted the traitor. Spotting him, Yan Zhao retreated into an alley, Guan Yu in pursuit.

“Cease skulking,” Yan Zhao spat, feigning composure. “State your purpose.”

“To execute a Yun Qing Sect traitor,” Guan Yu retorted, brandishing his Soul Sunderer Blade. “Your alliance with the Demonic Soul Sect marks you for death.”

Yan Zhao sneered. “You lecture me? Consorting with the Demonic Soul Sect’s young mistress makes you the true turncoat!”

“Our bond transcends sect rivalries. I’ve betrayed none.” Guan Yu’s blade flared with Qi. “This ends now.”

A Qi Slash carved stone as Yan Zhao dodged, erecting spiritual barriers. Though outmatched, he stalled desperately until a golden whip deflected Guan Yu’s killing strike—the Demonic Soul Sect’s Right Envoy arriving barely in time.

Saved by reinforcements, Yan Zhao lived another day, but Guan Yu’s resolve hardened. The viper would be crushed—if not now, then soon.
