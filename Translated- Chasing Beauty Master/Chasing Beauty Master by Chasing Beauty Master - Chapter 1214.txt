The mist here wasn’t as thick as on the mountain, and his phone finally had signal. Guan Yu dialed Xue Jing’s number.

“Hello? Qiaoqiao?” Xue Jing’s voice came through.

Guan Yu chuckled. “It’s me. My phone fell and broke, and this place is too remote to buy a new one. I’m borrowing Qiaoqiao’s phone to call you.”

“So careless!” Xue Jing complained. “When are you coming back? You’ve been away too long. This morning, your older sister called to ask about you.”

Guan Yu hesitated. This was the first time he’d stayed away so long. They must all miss him. “Is everyone alright? Has Hanhan caused any trouble?”

“You’re one to ask! Since you’ve been gone, Hanhan moved her computer into your room. She games there all day, saying she’ll spot you the moment you return.”

Clearly, Hanhan missed him. That clever girl. “There’s still some business here. I might not return soon. Qiaoqiao’s aunt was kidnapped. Brother Jinci and I are tracking leads.”

“What? Be careful, Guan Yu! Don’t leave Brother Jinci’s side, understand?”

“I know. I’m always cautious. Besides, I’m not weak anymore. Remember? I held my ground protecting you for two minutes. Ordinary people can’t touch me.” His tone brimmed with confidence.

“Pfft—only because you cheated! If it weren’t for Qiaoqiao’s emergency, I’d never have let you go.”

A beeping sound interrupted. Lin Qiaoqiao’s phone was dying. “Luckily I helped her. Otherwise, she’d have married that fat villain from the martial arts tournament—one of the Ten Great Villains of the Jianghu! Brother Jinci disguised himself as me to defeat him.”

“Hah! Maybe we should’ve let Qiaoqiao marry the villain. When you return, I’ll settle accounts with her—borrowing my man for so long without even a thank-you! So rude.”

**Chapter 3117: A Routine Matter**

Guan Yu knew Xue Jing joked, which meant all was well at home. Relieved, he added, “Jingjing, keep things safe while I’m gone. I’ll hurry back once this wraps up.”

“Don’t worry. With so many sisters here, no man would dare intrude. I’ll guarantee not a single girl’s missing when you return!” She laughed.

Guan Yu nodded. “When I come back, I’ll bring Qiaoqiao’s aunt’s family to work at the tannery. Their home’s unlivable now. I’ll explain details later—the phone’s dying.”

“Already? That junk phone!” Xue Jing huffed. “And you’re always unreachable! If Brother Jinci weren’t protecting you, I’d have dragged you home myself!”

“This area’s too remote. I have to climb mountains just to get signal. I’ll have Qiaoqiao charge the phone. We’ll talk more later.”

“Fine. Bye.”

After hanging up, Brother Jinci remarked, “Was lying to her wise? They surely miss you.”

“Necessary for now. I don’t want them worrying. Here—get this charged.” Guan Yu tossed him the phone.

Brother Jinci sighed. “Yunqing Mountain’s beautiful, but too isolated. Even charging spots are scarce.”

Guan Yu stood on a hill west of the village. To his west loomed the cloud-piercing peaks of Yunqing Mountain. From here, the summits hid in mist. After days there, he’d learned its electricity was erratic—powered by unknown means. Most nights relied on glowstones or candles. Few rooms had electric lights.

Last night, Lin Qiaoqiao’s phone had only half-charged before the power died. “Brother Jinci, charge it at her aunt’s empty house in the village.”

“Good idea. I’ll escort you up first and take her aunt’s phone too.”

Only Qiaoqiao and her aunt had phones left. Brother Jinci had long lost his—a habit. He often misplaced everything but his blade.

Guan Yu warned, “Don’t lose these! We’ll need them to contact the Qiaoyuan District.”

“Relax. I’ll sneak in quietly and stay overnight. The Yunqing folks wouldn’t risk offending you anyway.”

“But who’ll drink with me if you stay?”

“I’ll hide the phones and return. Prepare snacks!” With that, Brother Jinci left.

**Chapter 3118: The Kitchen**

Xiao Zhu approached. “Brother-in-law, drinking all night? Who’ll guard me and Cousin?”

“Sleep first. I’ll stay outside your door. No harm will come.”

“No loud noises or wandering! It’s late—Cousin, let’s sleep.”

After they retired, Guan Yu wandered the courtyard, realizing he’d never located the kitchen. Brother Jinci expected snacks, but they might go hungry.

Ma Xiao passed by. Guan Yu asked, “Brother Ma, where’s the kitchen?”

“Hungry? Want a midnight snack?”

“A bit. My friend and I plan to drink. Could use some dishes.”

“Master ordered us to fulfill your requests. I’ll have the kitchen prepare something.”

“No need—I’ll cook myself.”

“Nonsense. Follow me.”

Guan Yu trailed cautiously. Ma Xiao gestured ahead. “Our Qianhui Peak’s kitchen. Small but well-stocked. Our pastures and gardens are Yunqing’s largest—others envy our feasts.”

“I saw the hillside pasture—all yours?”

“Yes. Ten-acre vegetable plots too. Other peaks lack space or soil. We trade produce for treasures—Qianhui’s the wealthiest.”

Entering the kitchen, Ma Xiao boasted of their provisions—fresh vegetables, half a hog, and a lamb. The brick stoves required firewood, unfamiliar to Guan Yu.

Spotting the lamb, Guan Yu grinned. “Let’s roast this! Where’s the seasoning?”

Ma Xiao fetched a cart. Guan Yu loaded wood, liquor, the lamb, and spices.

“Thank you, Brother Ma.”

“My pleasure.”

Returning, Guan Yu built a fire. As the lamb sizzled, Brother Jinci arrived.

“Impressive! Worth the trip!”

They drank and chatted by the flames. Guan Yu’s marinade—oil mixed with spices—perfumed the air.

Suddenly, the door creaked open. Xiao Zhu sleepwalked in, wearing only a pink肚兜, sniffing. “Sooo fragrant…”

Guan Yu scooped her up before she reached the fire. “Want meat? Dress first!”

**Chapter 3119: Drooling**

Xiao Zhu pouted. “That smell woke me! I forgot clothes…”

After dressing, she joined them, devouring lamb and peppering them with questions. By 3 a.m., she stumbled back to bed. Guan Yu and Brother Jinci talked till dawn.

“If not for Sakurako’s loyalty,” Brother Jinci mused, “I’d have moved West years ago.”

“Futile. Your enemies would chase you to the moon. Only quitting as a killer would end it.”

“True. Blood clings to my hands. Even if I stop, others won’t. Thankfully, Sakurako’s safe in Qiaoyuan now.”

The eastern sky paled as they spoke, the lamb long gone, leaving only memories and embers.
