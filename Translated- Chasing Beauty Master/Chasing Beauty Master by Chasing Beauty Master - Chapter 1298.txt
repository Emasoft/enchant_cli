“Exactly. This matter requires Elder Dai’s approval. We must also report to the sect leader at Tiger’s Head Peak. Most importantly, we need a plausible excuse to take you out. A poor pretext won’t work,” Guanyu explained.

“Of course I know that. But you’re so capable, Guanyu—I’m sure you’ll figure it out, right?” Xiaotong said with unwavering trust. “Then it’s settled. Once you’ve recovered, you must take me down the mountain. Hehehe. Rest now—I won’t disturb you any longer.”

Guanyu cautiously said he’d “try his best,” but she skipped away as if he’d already agreed. Muttering to himself, he grumbled, “Day after day, nothing but trouble. It was like this back home, and now even here. Not a single moment of peace.”

He had hoped to cultivate in tranquility at Yunqing Sect, yet chaos followed—Demonic Sect recruits scheming unknown evils, disrupting his plans. Though he wished to focus on his immortal path, Sect Leader Xuan Ming’s orders to descend the mountain couldn’t be refused. As a disciple, duty bound him.

Over the following days, Guanyu agonized. Taking Xiaotong risked complications, yet refusing would betray her earlier favor. Without a convincing pretext, Xuan Ming wouldn’t permit her inclusion. Failing this would tarnish Guanyu’s competence. Trapped between obligations, his mind churned helplessly.

Days later, Guanyu’s wounds had nearly healed. During this time, he subdued all the spiritual energy within his body, mastering it completely.

Xuan Ming summoned the top four disciples to Tiger’s Head Peak’s grand hall. Seated loftily, he inquired, “Guanyu, I hear you’ve recovered?”

“Thank you for your concern, Master. I’m fully healed,” Guanyu replied respectfully.

Nodding, Xuan Ming declared, “Good. I’ll have you four depart tomorrow to investigate the Demonic Sect’s movements in Qujiang City. Here are your mission details. Remember—conceal your identities. Exposure risks attracting their attention. Understood?”

As Xuan Ming tossed a scroll to Guanyu, the disciple recalled Xiaotong’s plea. Duty-bound, Guanyu ventured, “Master, may I propose something? Since our mission involves reconnaissance, greater numbers would prove advantageous. I recommend bringing another—Xiaotong from Convergence Peak. Her sharp wit could prove invaluable. More hands ensure better outcomes against potential threats.”

Xuan Ming raised an eyebrow. “This Xiaotong—what merits her inclusion?”

“Her cultivation may not astonish,” Guanyu admitted, “but her resourcefulness complements our task. At the Six Peaks Tournament, had she not faced me early, she’d have reached the top eight. Her skills are exceptional.”

Siqi unexpectedly supported: “Sect Leader, Senior Xiaotong entered years before me. Her abilities are beyond doubt.”

Guanyu wondered—had Xiaotong lobbied others?

Xuan Ming hesitated. “Stealth demands minimal numbers. More eyes attract suspicion.”

Xiao Zhi interjected: “We could pose as merchants visiting my uncle in Qujiang City. His estate provides ample cover.”

“Xiaotong won’t hinder us,” Guanyu pressed. “Her presence would strengthen our efforts.”

Relenting under collective persuasion, Xuan Ming decreed: “Very well. Inform Xiaotong to join you. But remember—maintain secrecy and report any developments.”

Guanyu exhaled in relief. Without Siqi and Xiao Zhi’s support, this would’ve failed. Siqi simply valued Xiaotong’s companionship; Xiao Zhi welcomed another beauty’s company.

That evening, plans solidified. The group would depart at dawn from Front Return Peak.

“Truly? The sect leader approved?” Xiaotong leapt like an elated child. “Thank you, Siqi!”

“Thank Guanyu,” Siqi smiled. “I’m glad you’re coming—we’ll support each other.”

“Support? Don’t you have Guanyu for that?” Xiaotong teased.

“You’re impossible!” Siqi feigned offense. “Pack your things—we leave at dawn.”

**Chapter 3344: The Black-Furred Monster (Part 2)**

A forearm-thick sapling splintered under Guanyu’s punch. “My internal energy flows freely now,” he mused. “Why does it fail when most needed?”

“Heheh,” Second-to-Wolf mocked. “Poor cultivation recovery—like a postpartum mother neglecting convalescence. With Siqi distracting you, no wonder your energy falters. Serves you right.”

Guanyu grimaced—the jab held truth. “Enough talk. Train me while I can channel it.”

“Defend yourself!” Second-to-Wolf blurred across ten meters, foot slamming Guanyu’s chest before he could react. The disciple crashed against a tree, energy deserting him again.

“I relish this,” the wolf-man chuckled. “Daily beatings suit me fine.”

Guanyu seethed. Moments prior, his energy flowed strong—now vanished. Had danger triggered this flaw? Useless power indeed!

“Beware!”

Second-to-Wolf’s roar preceded a black monstrosity’s crimson claws raking Guanyu’s back. Three bloody gashes bloomed as the creature retreated from Second-to-Wolf’s counterattack.

“Filthy ambusher!” Guanyu spat through pain. “What demon was that?”

“No demon,” Second-to-Wolf growled, tending wounds. “A man transformed—claws real, fur genuine, but human eyes beneath. Yunqing hides dark secrets.”

After reporting to Elder Lu, revelations surfaced: similar attacks occurred recently. One disciple lost an arm.

“Six years prior,” Elder Lu revealed, “this creature invaded our forbidden peaks. Though wounded by Elder Jiu, it’s returned stronger. Demonic Sect’s Bloodwing Art—a metamorphosis into bestial form. Its focus was the forbidden zones before... Why strike Front Return Peak now?”

Guanyu connected dots: “Could it be related to the village chief’s son?”

“Impossible,” Elder Lu dismissed. “Yunqing’s defenses repel intruders. This evil festers within.”

Second-to-Wolf theorized: “A transformed disciple? Any disappearances?”

Elder Lu sighed. “The sect leader knew. Years ago, it preyed on disciples until driven off. Now it returns—bolder, deadlier. We must alert all: curfew after dark until this menace is purged.”

As Guanyu’s group prepared for their mission, shadows deepened over Yunqing Sect—a festering corruption threatening to erupt.
