For the people of the Yunqing Sect, Shi Zhenxiang had no intention of confronting them with hostility. Such a powerful sect would never let her off easily, even without concrete evidence.

If she had known this earlier, she would have simply killed Lin Chen outright and buried his corpse where no one could find it. She had thought leaving him alone in the wilderness would either freeze him to death or leave him beyond recovery. Yet against all odds, he had returned—a miscalculation that now filled her with regret.

With nowhere to hide, Shi Zhenxiang decided to head to Sister Mei Inn first. If she had to flee, she needed to retrieve her hoarded treasures to feel secure.

Upon arriving, she deliberately instructed the staff: “If anyone comes asking for me, say I’m not here.” The two girls behind the counter curiously asked what was wrong.

Shi Zhenxiang merely claimed she had quarreled with her husband and wished to see neither him nor anyone else. Retreating upstairs, she retrieved a hidden box from the wall, emptied its contents into a cloth bundle, and prepared to flee if necessary.

After packing, she stood by the window, watching the streets below. If no one came for her, it might mean the danger had passed—either the sect had given up or her husband had resolved the matter.

But if men from the bun shop appeared, it would signal grave trouble. Shi Zhenxiang knew the Yunqing Sect’s influence was vast, and this affair would not end quietly. She steeled herself to flee far away, convinced even the remotest corners of this town offered no safety.

**Chapter 4465: Fleeing**

Dozens of men fanned out from the bun shop in pairs. Though Shi Zhenxiang usually appeared obedient, she frequented only two places: Sister Mei Inn, run by her closest friend, and a nearby acupuncture parlor where she treated her chronic neck pain. The third location was her parents’ home, built with her husband’s money after he brought them to town.

Search parties split to check her house, the parlor, and the inn while others scoured the town. Growing impatient, Shi Zhenxiang nearly went downstairs for wine to calm her nerves when she spotted two men from the bun shop approaching.

“Is our mistress here?” they demanded upon entering the inn.

The counter girls exchanged glances. “She hasn’t come today. Try elsewhere.”

Recognizing the servants, they obeyed Shi Zhenxiang’s earlier order. When the men left, she shouldered her heavy bundle and descended to find Sister Mei.

“Sister Mei, I need to leave for a while. Please send word to my parents: I’ll wait for them at the ruined temple five li outside town.”

“But why involve your parents?” Sister Mei frowned. “A quarrel isn’t worth such drama.”

“Trust me as a sister and don’t ask,” Shi Zhenxiang insisted urgently. “I must go now.”

Without time to buy a horse, she hurried south on foot. At the bun shop, the old master grew anxious as search parties returned empty-handed.

Ling Su, a Yunqing disciple, sneered: “Either you’re stalling to let her escape, or she’s already fled after committing the crime.”

The old master stammered, “I swear to resolve this. She’ll return soon—”

“We won’t wait forever!” Ling Su snapped. “If she’s guilty, you’ll pay eight hundred taels of silver—plus medical costs for our poisoned brother!”

The old master paled. Such a sum was ruinous. Before he could protest, another pair of servants rushed in, gasping: “She’s not at her parents’ house either!”

“See? She’s absconded with the silver!” Ling Su accused.

**Chapter 4466: “I Don’t Know You”**

Unaware of the chaos, Shi Zhenxiang neared the town’s southern exit—only to find her path blocked by Guanyu and Siqi.

“In a hurry, Mistress Bun Shop?” Guanyu smiled.

“You’ve mistaken me for someone else,” she lied, edging past them.

Guanyu called after her: “Will you abandon your husband to face ruin alone?”

When she quickened her pace, he warned: “Take one more step, and I’ll break your leg.”

She froze, then whirled around. “Why force me to desperation?”

“You admitted knowing we’re from Yunqing Sect,” Siqi countered. “Yet you tried to murder our brother!”

“I thought he’d die!” Shi Zhenxiang spat. “Fate spared him.”

**Chapter 4467: Waiting for You**

Guanyu’s gaze hardened. “Return and face justice, or lose everything.”

“You think I’ll believe Yunqing’s ‘justice’?” she scoffed.

“We never claimed to enforce it,” Guanyu said. “But you’ve condemned yourself.”

Realizing her slip, Shi Zhenxiang glared. “You set this trap!”

“We guard all exits,” Guanyu shrugged. “Surrender the silver, or your husband pays the price.”

Trapped, she clutched her bundle tighter. The game was up.
