Chen Lin glared at Guan Yu, his face flushing crimson with rage.

How could he not detect the sarcasm in Guan Yu's words? The "ability" Guan Yu referred to wasn't Chen Lin's talent, but his skill in seducing the granddaughter-in-law of a military bigwig.

Or, to put it another way, his prowess as a kept man was truly impressive.

Chen Lin's fists clenched tightly, nails digging into his palms.

After a long silence, he sighed helplessly. "I don't want the things anymore. Give them to me when you think the time is right! Can we sit down and talk now?"

"Seems you're quite clever after all. Why keep playing the fool? Haven't you heard the saying? 'Cuteness is shameless!'" Guan Yu shook his head and sighed.

Suddenly, he laughed—a pure, unadulterated laugh full of cunning. "Come work for me for free!"

"Work for me without pay!"

This bombshell sent shockwaves through the room. Not only did Chen Lin stare at Guan Yu in disbelief, even Li Xi—who had been sitting quietly—showed astonishment in her eyes. Clearly, she hadn't anticipated such a demand from Guan Yu.

Was he insane? Asking someone to work for free? One might as well believe in pigs flying. Li Xi's beautiful eyes scrutinized Guan Yu, trying to discern his true motives.

Chen Lin's initial shock quickly turned to fury. "You go too far!" he spat through gritted teeth.

To Chen Lin, Guan Yu was nothing but an opportunistic villain who'd seized his weakness. Being forced to help was bad enough, but this new demand crossed the line.

Guan Yu remained unperturbed, sipping his wine. "I don't consider this bullying. Working for me ensures your safety—no more living in fear. If your secrets get out... well, let's just say the consequences would be dire."

"You're smart enough to weigh the risks," Guan Yu pressed.

Chen Lin's face twisted. As a MIT PhD graduate who'd received countless lucrative offers, the thought of unpaid labor was unbearable.

After a prolonged silence, Chen Lin finally relented. "You're the most cunning young man I've ever met. I'll... work for free." The words tasted like ash.

Guan Yu stood, extending his hand. "Welcome to the team! Discuss specifics with Li Xi. I'll handle the funding."

As Chen Lin fled the room, Guan Yu turned to Li Xi with a triumphant grin. "Mission accomplished!"

"You trust him not to bite back?" Li Xi asked skeptically.

"He's too smart for that," Guan Yu replied confidently.

Li Xi's expression remained guarded. "There's trouble in Taiwan. The funding from Wan Qianshan has decreased significantly since New Year. We suspect rebellion."

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. "Time to visit Taiwan."

"I'm coming," Li Xi stated flatly.

"Eager to share my bed?" Guan Yu teased.

"Your face matches your thoughts—equally thick," Li Xi retorted dryly. "I need market research there."

Meanwhile, in a secretive Kyoto club, men discussed retaliations. "The culprit is Guan Yu—northern upstart who controls N City's underground. He must die!" declared Li Yu, his scarred face twisting with malice.

At the upscale Pinming Club, two mismatched figures loitered outside. The rainbow-haired man elbowed his companion: "Xiao Nao, stop drooling! At least use your own sleeve!"
