“Jiang Ziqi pointed at Sun Mande and turned to Guan Yu, speaking with great dissatisfaction.

Others might not understand Guan Yu, but Jiang Ziqi, who had been at odds with him for so long, knew all too well about Guan Yu’s character and capabilities.

Even someone at the pinnacle of Beijing’s elite youth hierarchy like himself had been completely subdued by Guan Yu. A third-rate playboy like Sun Mande? If Guan Yu truly wanted to crush him, it’d be as easy as squashing an ant.

Jiang Ziqi strongly suspected Guan Yu was just bored and deliberately provoking him for amusement.

Guan Yu scoffed, looking at Jiang Ziqi with disdain as if he were an idiot. “I don’t keep underlings around just to eat and do nothing!”

Jiang Ziqi clenched his fists, veins bulging on his forehead, his face flushed crimson—clearly infuriated by Guan Yu’s words.

Being publicly called a “younger brother” was a massive humiliation for someone of Jiang Ziqi’s status. He felt utterly degraded.

However, this state lasted only a moment before Jiang Ziqi slowly relaxed his fists.

He realized arguing with Guan Yu was futile. Given his current subjugation, confronting Guan Yu would be suicidal.

Instead, he redirected his fury toward Sun Mande, seeking to reclaim his lost superiority through the latter.

After all, the weak existed to be trampled underfoot.

“Just tell me how to deal with this trash. I’m busy and won’t waste time on scum like him!” Jiang Ziqi snapped impatiently.

Sun Mande, who’d been ignored since Jiang Ziqi’s arrival, felt deeply insulted. He’d been reduced to a mere bystander in his own conflict.

Enraged, Sun Mande pointed at Jiang Ziqi and roared, “What the hell are you, daring to lecture me? Believe it or not, I’ll have you killed, you bastard!”

Sun Mande didn’t recognize Jiang Ziqi. To a low-tier playboy like him, someone of Jiang Ziqi’s stature was beyond his reach.

Jiang Ziqi’s expression darkened.

But to Sun Mande, this only proved Jiang Ziqi’s weakness. Emboldened, Sun Mande continued his tirade: “I’m here for your boss, not some spineless lackey like you! Get out of my sight!”

After the outburst, Sun Mande regained his composure, reveling in his momentary triumph.

Guan Yu burst into uproarious laughter, doubling over and pointing at Jiang Ziqi. “Little brother, why don’t you scram and let me handle this?”

Jiang Ziqi’s face turned livid, fists trembling with suppressed rage.

“Shut him up!” Jiang Ziqi growled through gritted teeth.

Xiao Dao, Jiang Ziqi’s subordinate, moved like a shadow. A moment later, a bloodcurdling scream echoed through the room as Sun Mande collapsed unconscious against the wall.

The onlookers gasped. This man had incapacitated Sun Mande in one strike—a feat far more terrifying than Guan Yu’s earlier beating.

Guan Yu scowled. “You call this solving the problem? Even I could knock him out! What use are you as a subordinate?”

Jiang Ziqi’s fists shook violently. “Guan Yu, don’t push me too far!”

The atmosphere tensed.

“You want to kill me?” Guan Yu smirked, eyes narrowing dangerously.

Jiang Ziqi’s anger faltered under Guan Yu’s oppressive aura.

At that moment, the door burst open again. The club’s manager, Luo, entered with security guards.

After assessing the situation, Luo approached Jiang Ziqi obsequiously. “Sir, for Mr. Sun’s safety and our club’s reputation, we must provide medical aid.”

“He won’t die,” Jiang Ziqi dismissed coldly.

“Bring Wu Bao here,” Jiang Ziqi commanded.

Luo paled but hurried to fetch the club’s owner.

Wu Bao arrived promptly, greeting Jiang Ziqi with deference. After understanding the situation, he assured, “Leave this to me, Jiang Shao.”

Jiang Ziqi nodded curtly, then glared at Guan Yu. “Satisfied now?”

“Wake him up exactly how you knocked him out,” Guan Yu demanded.

Jiang Ziqi seethed but relented. Xiao Dao delivered a vicious kick to Sun Mande’s ribs, jolting him awake with a scream.

“Satisfied?” Jiang Ziqi spat.

Guan Yu shook his head. “He threatened my friend. Handle it.”

Jiang Ziqi suppressed his fury and ordered Wu Bao: “Clean up this mess.”

Wu Bao, recognizing the power dynamics at play, complied without hesitation. The incident concluded with Sun Mande’s humiliation serving as a stark reminder of the hierarchy’s ruthlessness.
