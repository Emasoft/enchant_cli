“Well, what a grand name! Guan Yu, would you consider parting with this raw stone? I’d like to test my luck today.” Boss Li smiled amiably at Guan Yu, his casual tone suggesting mere amusement.

“That... depends on your offer, brother!” Guan Yu skipped the formalities and cut straight to the point.

Considering Boss Li had instantly raised the bid for the earlier ice-type jade from over four million to over six million without hesitation, it was clear he was a tycoon with deep pockets. Now that he wanted this stone, price naturally became Guan Yu’s primary concern.

“Hmm... twenty million. How’s that?”

“Twenty million...” Guan Yu scratched his head, inwardly stunned. The profit came too easily! A mere stone multiplying its value countless times after cutting?

Yet unsure whether twenty million was fair, Guan Yu glanced at Master Wang, the stone cutter, for guidance.

“This emerald-green ice-type jade... If we continue polishing inward without hitting flaws or impurities, it could reach thirty million. With consistent quality on this side, thirty-seven or thirty-eight million wouldn’t be impossible. But...” Master Wang chuckled, spreading his hands. “No one can guarantee what’s inside.”

Boss Li showed no displeasure at this explanation, nodding agreeably. The decision to sell or continue gambling rested solely with Guan Yu.

“Well... twenty million... How about we polish another side first?” Guan Yu proposed with a grin, his dissatisfaction with the offer clear.

“Bold move, young man! But heed my advice—if polishing this side reveals flaws or lower quality jade, its value might drop below twenty million. Are you certain?”

“No matter. If it fails, I’ll treat it as a lost gamble. Better than ending up with worthless rubble!” Guan Yu waved dismissively.

“Very well. Let’s see!” Boss Li smiled, though his eyes narrowed thoughtfully as Guan Yu focused on Master Wang’s work. The young man’s confidence puzzled him. What gave this youth such audacity to keep gambling? For someone his age to remain unfazed by millions... Only two possibilities arose: either he came from immense wealth—unlikely given his humble appearance—or he possessed unshakable certainty about the stone’s value. The latter made him someone worth cultivating.

As jade prices soared, premium-grade stones became rarer than phoenix feathers. Even Boss Li’s major jewelry conglomerate struggled to meet demand, forcing him to personally hunt for raw gems. This intriguing youngster might be the golden goose he needed.

**Chapter 199: Beauty’s Bid**

Of course, a third possibility existed—Guan Yu might simply be an idiot content with petty gains. But as the grinding wheel revealed increasingly vibrant green depths, Boss Li’s excitement grew. His fists clenched as he watched—not for the stone itself, but for the treasure he’d discovered: Guan Yu’s uncanny discernment.

“Brother Guan Yu! Congratulations!” Boss Li approached with clasped hands once the full, flawless emerald emerged. “This premium jade is flawless—a rare find indeed!”

After exchanging pleasantries, Boss Li offered: “Forty-five million at market price. Deal?”

Before Guan Yu could respond, a sunglasses-clad woman stepped forward. “Forty-eight million, handsome.”

“Fifty million,” Boss Li countered without blinking.

“Fifty-three!” The woman removed her shades, smirking challengingly.

“Fifty-five.” Boss Li’s calm demeanor left Guan Yu starstruck—this was true financial prowess!

Unbeknownst to him, the jade’s craftsmanship potential justified the bids. Yet Guan Yu awkwardly interjected: “Why not split it?”

Both bidders shot him exasperated looks. Cutting such a masterpiece would be sacrilege.

Undeterred, the woman fluttered her lashes. “Sell to me, and I’ll treat you to dinner.”

Though stunning—porcelain features, doe eyes—her concealed disdain didn’t escape Guan Yu’s enhanced perception.

“Dinner’s unnecessary,” he declined, gesturing at the growing crowd. “I’ll need to worry about leaving safely after this.”

Seizing the cue, Boss Li dialed his security team. “Guan Yu, whether you sell to me or not, I’ll ensure your safety today. Anyone targeting you answers to Li Yuanshan!”

Guan Yu’s probing ability confirmed the man’s sincerity. Here was his gateway into the jade circle—and perhaps reconciliation with Du Xiaojuan’s prejudiced family.

“Brother Li, let’s stick to your original forty-five million.” The crowd gasped as Guan Yu voluntarily forfeited over ten million.

**Chapter 200: Lion’s Demand**

“Y-you’re serious?” Boss Li stammered, mirroring the crowd’s shock.

Guan Yu simply smiled. The “lost” millions bought crucial protection and connections. Survival mattered more than temporary wealth.

The wire transfer left him dizzy. Years of backbreaking labor versus today’s windfall... All thanks to that mysterious coin’s power.

As Guan Yu stored the remaining stone half, Boss Li chuckled. “Expecting more jade? The odds are—”

“Can’t hurt to check!”

Their exit was blocked by a bald, eyebrowless mountain of muscle flanked by twenty thugs.

“Hand over whoever attacked my man,” the gang leader growled.

Boss Li stepped forward. “Brother Guo, let’s discuss. My young friend here offers one million medical compensation.”

“One million?!” The brute glared. “Half his earnings—or else.”

Guan Yu’s companion nudged him. “They’re armed.”

**Chapter 201: Safe Exit**

Tension crackled as Boss Li’s men arrived, tipping the balance. Under the tycoon’s steely gaze, the gang leader finally relented, accepting the settlement.

Walking away unscathed, Guan Yu marveled at life’s turns. With Boss Li’s patronage, his path forward gleamed brighter than any jade.
