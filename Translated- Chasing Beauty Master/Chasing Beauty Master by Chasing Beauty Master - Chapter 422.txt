“Guan Yu, I know your martial arts are formidable! But no matter how skilled you are, can you outpace my bullets? If you take even one second to deal with them, they'll riddle this delicate beauty full of holes!”

Wan Qianshan felt utterly secure. Not only were his subordinates armed, but he himself carried a gun. A single pull of the trigger would reduce Li Xi to a fragrant corpse. Guan Yu stood at least thirty to forty meters away - even if he possessed qinggong lightness skills, he couldn't possibly cover that distance fast enough to stop him.

What a pity about such a beautiful woman. He should have played with her earlier.

Guan Yu took a deep breath and said calmly, “Wan Qianshan, you’ve underestimated me after all!” With these words, he flung the small stone he’d been clutching in his hand.

Simultaneously, both he and Lin Dong vanished from their spots—one surging forward, the other retreating backward.

Left with no choice, Guan Yu activated his supernatural abilities. As Wan Qianshan instinctively flinched from the thrown stone, Guan Yu employed his gravity system, darting forward like a phantom to snatch Li Xi into his arms.

Wan Qianshan only saw darkness flash before his eyes, then Li Xi disappeared from his grasp. When his vision cleared, she was already several meters away in Guan Yu’s embrace.

Before he could react, the cold kiss of metal pressed against his temple. He needed no guess to know what it was.

“H-how... how did you do this?”

Wan Qianshan gulped. In that split second, not only had the woman vanished from his arms, but the gun had been plucked from his hand. He’d seen nothing but an afterimage.

Ignoring him, Guan Yu teased Lin Dong: “Still think you’re faster?”

Silently, Lin Dong subdued Wan Qianshan’s henchmen. After shooting Guan Yu a glance, he wordlessly took position beside Li Xi, frustration simmering. No matter how he trained, his speed always lagged behind Guan Yu’s. This inferiority grated on him.

He resolved to find an excuse for martial instruction later—a proper beating might vent this stifling resentment.

With Li Xi safe, Guan Yu relaxed slightly, though his hatred for Wan Qianshan remained undiminished. This wretch had threatened him repeatedly—letting him live would make Guan Yu appear weak.

“Wan Qianshan, spare me your questions. Now comes your reckoning.”

Thinking execution imminent, Wan Qianshan collapsed to his knees. “You can’t kill me! This is Taiwan! My death would bring you endless trouble!”

A murderous aura erupted from Guan Yu like a wrathful deity gazing down at an insect. “Kill you? You’d soil my hands. Besides, death would be too merciful. Remember what I planted inside you?”

“Y-yes!” How could he forget that torturous thing? It had reduced him to this wretched state.

“That creature doesn’t just inflict agony—it devours flesh. Like ants gnawing bones clean.”

“No! Master Guan! Spare me! I beg you! I’ll serve you faithfully, I swear!”

True fear gripped Wan Qianshan now, his pleas becoming desperate wails.

“I’d spare you, but your sins are unforgivable.”

Guan Yu activated the gu worms within Wan Qianshan’s body. The man immediately clutched his chest, writhing on the ground.

“What’s wrong, Xiping? Scared stiff?” Guan Yu approached the dazed Cao Xiping, clapping his shoulder.

The man screamed “Ghost!” and scrambled to the car, staring in terror. His expression suggested he’d seen the walking dead.

“You’re a grown man! Look at you!” Guan Yu couldn’t decide whether to laugh or scold. If basic abilities provoked such fear, revealing true powers might stop the man’s heart.

“Y-you’re not a ghost?”

“Do ghosts stand in broad daylight? Besides, we’ve known each other awhile—do I seem spectral?” Guan Yu guided Li Xi into the vehicle.

“But your speed!”

Cao Xiping’s reaction was understandable. He’d witnessed skilled martial artists, but none moving like Guan Yu’s phantom blur.

“Natural talent.” Guan Yu dismissed casually. “Now, if you want me to save your Yiyi, stay quiet. Forget everything you saw today.”

“Okay.” Though unsatisfied, Cao Xiping nodded for Jiang Yiyi’s sake. He’d learn the truth eventually when they reached the mainland. After tonight’s display, he now fully believed in Guan Yu’s capabilities.

Chapter 1056: The Jiang Family

Days later, Taiwan buzzed with strange news—former gang leader Wan Qianshan had vanished. Police found his watch and shredded clothing at Keelung’s abandoned mines, fragments crawling with iridescent insects previously unknown to science. The discovery caused an academic sensation. As for Wan Qianshan’s fate? No one cared.

“Xixi, are you alright? Did that bastard Wan Qianshan harm you?” Guan Yu sat close to Li Xi, dramatically inspecting her from head to toe under Lin Dong’s disapproving gaze—the lecher was clearly taking advantage.

Li Xi detected Guan Yu’s intentions, slightly furrowing her delicate brows but making no move to escape. Her voice remained its usual cool tone: “I’m fine.”

“Truly?”

Encouraged by her lack of resistance, Guan Yu edged closer until their bodies nearly touched, breaths mingling. Li Xi’s cheeks flushed as she squirmed slightly. “Really. Don’t worry.”

“Good. Had he touched you, I’d have returned to finish him! Still, you’ve suffered—come, let me comfort you.” Guan Yu’s silver tongue activated around Li Xi as he encircled her fragrant shoulders.

She considered evading but sighed inwardly—consider this repayment for saving her life twice.

Hah! The first barrier breached!

Guan Yu’s excitement surged. Were the car less crowded, he might have kissed her.

“Where are we going?”

Li Xi’s heart raced inexplicably. She grasped for conversation.

“Back to Taipei first. After a day or two, we’ll return to the mainland.” Guan Yu planned to treat Jiang Yiyi first—otherwise they’d leave immediately.

“What about the company?”

“Don’t worry—I’ve chosen a Taiwan branch manager. He’ll handle the mess.”

With Wan Qianshan gone, the Taiwan branch faced no major obstacles. Guan Yu felt confident entrusting operations to Fang Qingzhuo, the mainlander he’d met at the company.

Li Xi nodded approval—Fang Qingzhuo was her appointed cadre, loyal and competent.

Upon returning to the hotel, Song Xiaoya rushed excitedly to greet them but halted awkwardly at seeing Li Xi in Guan Yu’s arms. “You’re back.”

Li Xi glanced between Song Xiaoya and Guan Yu, expression neutral though faint jealousy stirred unbeknownst to herself.

“This is Song Xiaoya, another executive. She’ll develop our Beijing operations.”

“Beijing?” Li Xi frowned—wasn’t that her domain?

“Hands-on management has merits, but wasting talent is folly. Her major was administration—I’ll assess her progress in a year.”

After brief introductions, Guan Yu told Song Xiaoya: “Li Xi will be your superior. Consult her after returning.”

“Okay!” Eager to please her future boss, Song Xiaoya bombarded Li Xi with questions, allowing the latter to slip from Guan Yu’s embrace—much to his chagrin. He regretted introducing them so soon.

“Guan Yu, I contacted Uncle Jiang. He requests your immediate presence if available.”

Cao Xiping had urgently phoned the Jiangs, who promptly invited Guan Yu over upon hearing his credentials.

“Let’s go now.”

Seeing Li Xi engrossed with Song Xiaoya, Guan Yu accompanied Cao Xiping to the Jiang residence. Best to fulfill this obligation quickly for an early mainland return.

Approaching the lavish European-style villa, Guan Yu whistled. “Quite the mansion!”

“The Jiangs’ wealth rivals nations. They own multiple properties abroad,” Cao Xiping remarked. His own affluent family paled in comparison.

The butler greeted them. “Young Master Cao.”

“This is the doctor I mentioned for Yiyi.” Cao Xiping indicated Guan Yu.

“Him?” The butler eyed Guan Yu skeptically—too young, despite his mature dress. Resembling a fresh graduate, could he truly treat the young mistress? But protocol forbade objection, and Cao’s endorsement demanded respect.

Entering the hall, an elegant couple greeted them. “Xiping! Is this the doctor? So young!”

Unlike the butler, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang (Weiwen and wife) showed no overt doubt beyond surprise at Guan Yu’s youth.

Chapter 1057: Treating Jiang Yiyi

“Uncle Jiang, Guan Yu is highly capable. Let him try,” Cao Xiping said cautiously, unwilling to guarantee results.

The Jiangs had consulted hundreds of experts worldwide—renowned professors and folk healers alike—all helpless against their daughter’s condition. They now approached every recommendation as last-ditch efforts.

“We appreciate your efforts, Dr. Guan.” Jiang Weiwen nodded.

Noting the skepticism, Guan Yu shrugged and followed the butler to Jiang Yiyi’s chambers. The parents and Cao Xiping remained outside—recently, Yiyi had grown withdrawn even with family, signaling worsening illness.

“Miss is inside.” The butler withdrew, leaving Guan Yu before an ornate carved door. This case clearly held complexities.

Pushing it open revealed darkness pierced by faint curtained light. Guan Yu’s enhanced vision took in luxurious yet cozy decor—pink motifs hinting at the occupant’s former vivacity.

“Who are you?” A cold voice emerged from a shadowed corner. Only after scrutiny did Guan Yu discern a frail figure curled there.

The girl wore a white floral dress, raven hair cascading over features of heartbreaking delicacy—pale face streaked with tears, wide eyes filled with confusion and despair. A vision to stir protective instincts.

Though committed to six women, Guan Yu felt his heart soften. “I’m Guan Yu. Don’t be afraid—I’m just here to talk.”

Autism spectrum patients often rejected explicit medical help, hence Guan Yu’s gentle approach. Surprisingly, Jiang Yiyi saw through it. “I don’t need treatment.”

Guan Yu smiled ruefully—without this condition, she’d doubtless be sharp-witted.

“Actually, Yiyi, you’re not ill—just special. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have befriended Dongfang Mu and Cao Xiping.”

Her reaction confirmed Dongfang Mu had provided her number—unaware her condition had deteriorated so severely in months.

“What’s your relation to Brother Dongfang? Where’s Xiaoping?”

Her monotone gave no clues, but the question revealed lingering connections. Guan Yu pressed: “Dongfang worries about you. He hopes you’ll visit the mainland. Xiaoping waits outside.”

“Oh.” The response was flat.

After awkward silence, Guan Yu ventured: “May I check your pulse?”

Perhaps due to the mentioned friends, she extended a slender arm without resistance.
