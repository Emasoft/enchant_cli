“Guan Yu is truly someone who attracts girls too easily,” Wang Xiaorong declared absolutely. “Every beautiful girl seems connected to him. Once they meet him, they can’t help falling for him. He’s utterly unreliable. Who knows when he’ll meet another woman and forget about me? Men’s tendency to favor the new and discard the old—I’ve seen it too many times.”

“I don’t care! You’re staying with me tonight. No excuses!” Wang Xiaorong asserted domineeringly.

Guan Yu sighed helplessly. “Fine, I’ll stay. As long as it’s convenient for both of you.”

Wang Xiaorong’s expression softened. Changing the subject, she asked, “Have you eaten? Are you hungry? I’ll have someone prepare food.”

“Sure. Let’s have some good dishes and a pot of wine. Since there’s nothing else to do, we might as well drink,” Guan Yu replied cheerfully, though he had initially promised Siqi a quick return.

Trapped by their insistence, Guan Yu resigned himself to staying. He thought, *If I can’t leave, I’ll just rest here tonight. With Qiqi present, nothing unexpected should happen between me and Xiaorong.*

In high spirits, Guan Yu drank freely. Wang Xiaorong ordered the servants to serve their finest dishes, including a roasted chicken he praised: “Ah, this hit the spot! It’s been ages since I relaxed like this.”

Late into the night, Qiqi curiously approached. “Handsome Master, is wine really that good? My grandfather loved it so much he’d skip meals for it. But after Grandma fell ill, he quit to save money.”

“Your grandfather was a good man. Raising you must’ve been hard for them,” Guan Yu remarked. “Whether wine tastes good depends on the drinker’s mood. Want to try?”

“Grandpa said women shouldn’t drink. Can I?” Qiqi asked.

“Of course! He misled you. Wine is made from grain—not drinking it is a waste! It even keeps you youthful. A little wine now and then beautifies the skin,” Guan Yu explained.

Intrigued, Wang Xiaorong added, “Father always drank—during meetings, chess games, any time. But the smell repulsed me. Tea’s bitter acidity is better than wine’s harshness.”

“Both of you, humor me tonight.” Guan Yu filled two cups. “Madam, you first. Sip slowly, savor the flavor before swallowing.”

Persuaded, Wang Xiaorong took a tentative sip. Her face twisted as if she’d swallowed poison. Tears streamed while she coughed violently, amusing Guan Yu.

“Exaggerating, aren’t you? You look ready to vomit!” he teased.

Qiqi watched skeptically. “Grandpa always looked delighted after drinking. Why’s it so awful for you?”

“It’s torture!” Wang Xiaorong rasped, throat burning. “Qiqi, don’t fall for this! It’s agony!”

Guan Yu urged, “Eat something. It gets better with practice. Wine enhances food’s flavors.”

Wang Xiaorong nibbled dishes, recovering slightly. “Never again! This is worse than poison!” Her face flushed, head spinning from one sip.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Some aren’t suited for wine. Qiqi, want to try? It’s quite pleasant.”

**Chapter 4331: It’s Too Awful**

Qiqi hesitated until Wang Xiaorong mischievously encouraged, “Try it! Maybe you’ll inherit your grandfather’s taste.”

Guan Yu added, “It’s just wine, not poison.”

Qiqi gulped a large mouthful. Tears spilled instantly, yet she exclaimed, “So spicy…but thrilling! If only it weren’t so sharp!” She devoured food to cool her mouth.

Wang Xiaorong gaped. “You’re fine after that? We drank the same thing!”

“It’s fragrant underneath the burn!” Qiqi laughed, requesting more.

Baffled, Wang Xiaorong tried again, only to gasp, “Why create such torture? It’s pure fire!”

Qiqi, however, grew fond of the earthy aroma. By midnight, both women were rosy-cheeked and slurring. Wang Xiaorong wobbled, complaining, “My limbs feel poisoned!”

“So hot…need to undress,” Qiqi mumbled, loosening her belt.

Having consumed a pot and a half himself, Guan Yu felt woozy. Without sobering his mind through cultivation, he joined their tipsy antics. Playful slaps escalated until the women ganged up on him, pinning him to the bed.

In the tussle, Guan Yu pulled Wang Xiaorong close. Their breaths mingled until Qiqi piled on, sparking a chaotic trio that lasted till unconsciousness.

**Chapter 4332: A Major Incident**

At dawn, Guan Yu awoke to Wang Xiaorong draped over his legs and Qiqi clinging to his arm—both disheveled. Horrified, he struggled to recall the night.

Wang Xiaorong stirred first, smiling drowsily until noticing Qiqi. Her shriek roused the girl, who stared in shock at their state.

“What happened?!” Qiqi cried.

Guan Yu feigned confusion. “My head…what did we do?”

Wang Xiaorong rounded on Qiqi. “Your bed’s over there! Why are you here?”

“I…I must’ve gotten lost drunk,” Qiqi stammered, fleeing to her cot. A bloodstain on the sheets confirmed Guan Yu’s dread.

Awaiting fury, Guan Yu was stunned when Wang Xiaorong sighed, “You lucky devil—conquering two beauties in one night. Other men would seethe with envy.”

“I didn’t mean…I thought only you—”

“Hush.” Wang Xiaorong cut him off. “I knew Qiqi adored you from the start. She hid it for my sake.” She approached Qiqi’s hiding form. “No use pretending. Fate’s decided this. I despise sharing, but your charm leaves no choice.”

Pulling the blanket, she added, “Rise. I blame no one—except your irresistible allure.”
