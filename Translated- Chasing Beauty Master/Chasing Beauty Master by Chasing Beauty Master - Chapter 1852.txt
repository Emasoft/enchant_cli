“No matter where you go, there’s never a shortage of scumbags who think they’re God’s gift to women. Beauties attract attention wherever they go—a truth unchanged through the ages.

The man clearly intended to harass them, his face twisted into a lewd grin. “Oh? Didn’t expect such fiery tempers from two delicate flowers! I’ve always had a soft spot for spirited ones. Heh heh… No need to rush. Why don’t we get acquainted first?”

“Who wants to know you? You’re like a buzzing fly! Just looking at trash like you makes me sick. Get lost!” Qiqi retorted, barely restraining herself from outright cursing him.

**Chapter 4867: Trouble Brewing**

“No need to be so cold. Everyone here’s friendly—and I’m especially patient with beauties like you. You’ve got me wrapped around your finger,” the man slickly replied, oozing false charm.

From a distance, Guan Yu shook his head in resignation. Jiang Xin turned and remarked, “Wan Hong, looks like trouble’s found you again. Your women are… rather eye-catching.”

Duan Ruxue also recognized the two women as Wan Hong’s companions. Now that this scene had unfolded, she wondered how he’d handle it. Any man worth his salt would defend his women from harassment.

Guan Yu asked first, “Who is this fool? I’ve already dealt with Cao Di. What’s one more?”

“You might’ve misjudged this one. Qu Hua’s no less influential than Cao Di,” Jiang Xin explained. “He’s a relative of the Qin family’s matriarch—complicated connections. He’s been staying with the Qins and moves freely around the capital.”

Guan Yu nodded. Grand estates bred entitled nobles at every turn. Qu Hua was likely a close maternal relative of the Qins, perhaps even raised as their own. With the Qin family’s colossal influence, their young master Qin Huan’s fame naturally extended to Qu Hua.

Duan Ruxue lingered, curious to see Wan Hong’s response. Two choices lay before him: watch his women be harassed or intervene and risk offending the Qins. The matriarch doted on Qu Hua—rumor held he was her orphaned nephew, raised as her own son after his parents’ murder.

If Wan Hong angered both the Cao and Qin families… surviving the capital’s power games would prove difficult.

“Young Master Wan Hong,” Duan Ruxue probed, “your beloveds seem troubled. Should you need help resolving this…”

She wanted to test his mettle. A real man wouldn’t shrink from defending his women, even against celestial emperors. Such courage defined true charm—the willingness to stand firm before danger, shielding loved ones regardless of consequence.

If Wan Hong accepted her aid, her esteem for him would plummet.

Guan Yu remained unruffled, smiling faintly. “No need. This trifle requires no assistance from Lady Duan.”

His composure impressed her—a man of decisive bearing. But actions, not words, would prove his worth.

Jiang Xin hissed, “That Qu Hua’s as shameless as Cao Di! Drooling over women like a starved mutt. Why aren’t you stopping him?”

Though itching to intervene, their noble statuses constrained direct action. Guan Yu merely smiled. “Patience. My women aren’t easy prey. Consequences await those who overreach.”

He trusted Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi’s capabilities. Back in Huaxia, Xue Jing had managed Bridgehead District’s affairs effortlessly. Here, as Demonic Soul Sect’s young mistress, Wang Xiaorong’s upbringing guaranteed she wouldn’t suffer fools.

The crowd watched avidly as events unfolded. Qu Hua’s reputation preceded him—worse than Cao Di, a predator whose “conquests” often met tragic ends. Women who recognized him fled; only the desperate or unlucky remained.

Unaware of his infamy, the two beauties stood their ground. Qu Hua, scenting fresh prey, moved in.

**Chapter 4868: Worlds Apart**

“Move! We’re passing through. Even mutts know not to block the path!” Qiqi snapped, hands on hips.

Trapped between banquet tables with Qu Hua blocking their exit, Wang Xiaorong shot Guan Yu a glance. His subtle nod was all she needed.

Had Guan Yu not signaled restraint earlier, Qu Hua’s teeth would already litter the floor. Now, with permission granted…

As Qu Hua reached greedily, Wang Xiaorong snatched a platter to bat his hand aside, then stomped his foot—grinding her heel viciously. His yelp choked mid-air when Qiqi’s scissor-kick slammed between his legs with practiced precision.

The sickening crunch of ceramics underfoot mingled with the crowd’s collective wince. Qu Hua crumpled like a gutted shrimp, silent except for ragged breaths, face purpling in agony.

“Qiqi… did you overdo it?” Wang Xiaorong eyed the twitching heap.

“If he dies, that’s fate!” Qiqi huffed.

The crowd gaped. These delicate flowers packed martial prowess! Men instinctively cupped their groins in sympathy.

Guan Yu approved. Such vermin deserved worse. Let the Qins come—his women’s honor outweighed political consequences.

**Chapter 4869: Ruthless**

Jiang Xin and Duan Ruxue wore identical shock. As refined ladies, they’d never conceived such… direct solutions to harassment.

“Wan Hong… shouldn’t we call a physician?” Jiang Xin ventured, wincing.

“Let fate decide,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Reap what you sow.”

Duan Ruxue regained composure. “Young Master, I already admired your poise. Now I admire your women more.”

“We avoid trouble but never fear it,” Guan Yu stated. “The Qins may come. I’ll meet them head-on.”

His unflinching resolve deepened her respect—a man whose presence itself was a fortress.

Qiqi tugged Wang Xiaorong back to Guan Yu’s side. “He tried to grab us! Did I do right?”

“Perfectly.” He smiled as they clung to his arms.

Duan Ruxue studied the pair—especially Wang Xiaorong’s porcelain complexion, flawless as carved jade. A twinge of envy struck her: these women could openly claim their man, while she…

The thought dissolved as attendants rushed to aid Qu Hua. Another day, another noble’s disgrace—but this time, karma had bitten back. Hard.
