During their discussion, the Great Prince believed Prince Zou would assist him in securing the throne, while Prince Zou harbored the opposite intention. He thought that by leveraging the Great Prince’s influence in the capital and combining it with his own efforts, the throne might ultimately fall to him.

Both men held their private calculations, though Prince Zou had yet to reveal his true stance. On the surface, he appeared to be aiding the Great Prince.

Precisely because of this, the Great Prince treated Prince Zou with exceptional cordiality, even making premature promises. He declared that if he ever ascended the throne, Prince Zou would be elevated to the rank of Imperial Prince and honored as the foremost meritorious subject, with rewards so grand they would astonish him.

Prince Zou played along, knowing full well he currently lacked any foundation in the capital. Every step had to be taken with caution and steady progress. He understood that once Guan Yu and the others departed, he would lose his pillar of support and strategists. For now, he had no choice but to maintain a low profile.

“Your Highness,” Prince Zou inquired, “I’ve heard His Majesty has assigned you to manage the flood relief in Hanbei. When do you plan to depart?”

“I’ve already made preparations and sought His Majesty’s approval,” the Great Prince replied. “The imperial treasury will have thirty-five million taels of silver ready by tomorrow. I shall set out at dawn the day after.”

He added, “I’ll be taking two elite platoons—over two hundred soldiers. With such a vast sum of silver, caution is paramount.”

“Two hundred men still seem insufficient,” Prince Zou remarked. “His Majesty mentioned that the twenty million taels allocated to Hanbei last year never arrived. Such an enormous amount has simply... vanished?”

“Indeed,” the Great Prince confirmed. “The news was suppressed until this year’s disaster worsened. Because last year’s repairs were neglected, the suffering populace’s outcries finally reached the capital. I only learned of this myself days ago.”

“Who would dare embezzle such funds?” Prince Zou mused. “Two thousand million taels! What audacity—and capability—must they possess!”

“The truth remains unclear,” the Great Prince said. “Rumors point to factions in the martial world, but nothing is certain.”

After a pause, Prince Zou ventured, “Your Highness, I suspect this wasn’t solely the work of martial factions. Even if involved, they must have colluded closely with court insiders to pull this off.”

“With such a colossal sum, leaks were inevitable,” the Great Prince conceded. “Once I return from Hanbei, I’ll investigate thoroughly. That ‘tiger’ who devoured disaster funds will be rooted out.” His tone brimmed with confidence.

“Might I accompany you?” Prince Zou suddenly asked.

“Your Highness wishes to join?” The Great Prince hesitated. “While I’d welcome your company, this requires His Majesty’s consent. Should he approve, I’ll raise no objections.”

He continued, “Moreover, after your long journey here, proper rest is advisable. The road to Hanbei holds dangers I’d hate to expose you to.”

Prince Zou reconsidered. Even in the capital, his safety wasn’t guaranteed. Venturing to Hanbei might prove fatal—not just from personal risks, but from the covetous eyes fixed on the relief silver. Better to remain.

“To avoid burdening Your Highness,” Prince Zou said, “I’ll stay here. This allows me to strategize on your behalf. I possess substantial evidence—the Embroidered Uniform Guard and Imperial Guards repeatedly targeted me during my travels. Presenting this to His Majesty should yield justice. Even if Second Prince remains untouched, Minister Qi and Chancellor Li won’t escape unscathed. They’ll find no peace in the capital henceforth.”

The Great Prince brightened at this—precisely the outcome he desired. “Rest well these next days, Your Highness. My estate lacks maidservants, as I seldom keep attendants. But for you, I’ll arrange diligent servants immediately.”

“My gratitude,” Prince Zou said. “I’ve another request: those heroes who protected me en route—I wish to host them here in your estate.”

“Naturally!” The Great Prince waved generously. “I’ve already instructed that all their needs be met. Accommodating a few guests poses no difficulty.”

As thanks were exchanged, the Great Prince ventured, “Your Highness, I’ve heard tales of a remarkable individual named Guan Yu who aided your safe passage. Is this true? Where might he be found?”

“Oh? How did Your Highness hear of him?” Prince Zou countered, curiosity piqued. Had Guan Yu’s identity as a Yunqing Sect disciple been exposed? Unlikely—Guan Yu had maintained disguises, avoided using magic, and gone by the alias Lao Cang. Even Zou Wuhui remained unaware until the end. How then?

The Great Prince chuckled. “Merely rumors. I’ve always sought camaraderie with extraordinary talents from the martial world. I hoped to befriend this Guan Yu.”

Nodding thoughtfully, Prince Zou replied, “He traveled with my entourage initially. Whether he remains in the capital, I cannot say—I was summoned by His Majesty immediately upon arrival. Should I encounter him, I’ll bring him to you.”

“Splendid!” The Great Prince pressed, “Is he truly as formidable as legends say? I heard he rescued you from certain doom at a dark teahouse?”

Memories flooded Prince Zou—the black teahouse ambush, multiple narrow escapes. Guan Yu had saved him countless times, becoming an indispensable strategist. Yet his Yunqing Sect affiliation must stay secret—Elder Xuanming’s covert assistance spoke volumes about their sect’s support.

But how had word leaked? Prince Zou remained baffled. “Guan Yu possesses certain skills,” he hedged, “but all my companions contributed to our survival. I owe thanks to each.”

He resolved to consult Guan Yu first. Given Yunqing Sect’s reputation, Guan Yu might decline to reveal himself.

Their conversation stretched into strategic planning. The Great Prince confided his precarious position—despite his capabilities, courtiers largely dismissed him, flocking instead to the favored Second Prince. To gain recognition, he needed visible achievements. Success in Hanbei could shift perceptions, especially if entrusted with investigating last year’s silver scandal.

Meanwhile, Prince Zou announced an evening banquet in the estate. Performers entertained through dusk, replaced by dancers as night fell. Guests dined in courtyards, reveling in the festivities.

At a corner table, Guan Yu contemplated departure. “We leave tomorrow,” he told his companions. To his left sat Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi; to his right, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi.

Wang Xiaorong frowned. Guan Yu’s return to Yunqing Sect meant separation—an outcome she dreaded. “What becomes of me?” she protested.

“You knew I must eventually seek Miaocheng in the desert,” Guan Yu replied. “This won’t take long. I’ll find you afterward.”

Qiqi interjected, “Master, where does that leave me? I can’t just wander!”

“You’re free to choose,” Guan Yu said. “Return home, stay with Xiaorong, or follow me—though the desert is too perilous.”

“I’m your disciple!” Qiqi insisted. “I need to learn more!”

Wang Xiaorong scowled. “A girl trailing a man? Improper.”

Noting her jealousy, Guan Yu proposed, “Qiqi could stay with Xiaorong. You’d keep each other company until I return.”

Both women agreed—Qiqi to prevent temptation, Xiaorong to monitor her. Their uneasy truce held as dancers twirled nearby.

Prince Zou rose, offering libations. “First, to fallen comrades.” He poured wine earthward. “Second, to those present. May we remain allies!”

Cheers erupted, led by Hong Ren—the bandit leader now appointed as the estate’s guard commander. The Great Prince had shrewdly secured his six hundred men, assigning them to protect Prince Zou during his Hanbei mission.

As music swelled, Guan Yu’s group plotted departures, unaware their fates remained tethered to the princes’ schemes.
