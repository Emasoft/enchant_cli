Guan Yu immediately recognized that this must be the slot for the token. Once inserted, the stone gate would likely open.

He placed the token inside, and with a rumbling groan, the massive stone door slowly slid to the left. After the echoes faded, they saw descending stone steps leading deeper into the mountain.

“Seems this gate won’t open without the token,” Guan Yu remarked, waving for the three behind him to follow as he began descending.

Once all four entered, Guan Yu noticed the cavern walls were studded with luminous pearls, casting an ethereal glow throughout the space.

Wang Xiaorong gasped in awe. “Wow, it’s so beautiful here! Guan Yu, this reminds me of when we explored Meng Hua the Ancestor’s underground palace—those walls were also covered in luminous pearls!”

“The more beautiful a place appears, the more dangerous it might be,” Guan Yu cautioned, retrieving the token as the stone gate rumbled shut behind them. “Stay alert.”

“We’re already here—might as well explore,” Du Teng said breezily, striding forward. “This is Swordless Immortal’s personal quarters. Why would he set traps in his own home?”

Guan Yu agreed. A man’s private sanctum likely held no hidden dangers. Descending the steps, they soon reached a flat passage. A ten-meter path led to an arched doorway, beyond which opened a vast, glittering cavern.

The chamber overflowed with mountains of gold, silver, and jewels. Guan Yu’s eyes widened—he’d never seen such unimaginable wealth gathered in one place.

“Are we… rich now?” Du Teng exclaimed, breathless. Zhen Xiang’s eyes sparkled as she cried, “Heavens! Did we stumble into a treasure vault?”

Though indifferent to wealth himself, Du Teng acknowledged its necessity in daily life. Zhen Xiang, born into a merchant family, trembled with excitement at the commercial possibilities.

Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong remained calm, having never lacked material comforts. “Who knew Swordless Immortal was a dragon hoarding treasure?” Guan Yu mused. “There must be tons here.”

Wang Xiaorong tilted her head. “A ‘greedy dragon’? Is that a delicacy?”

“In our legends, dragons covet treasure above all else,” Guan Yu explained. “They sleep atop hoards and will kill to protect them.”

“How peculiar! I’ve never heard of wealth-obsessed beasts,” she laughed.

Guan Yu frowned, puzzled by the hoard’s origin. How could Swordless Manor, despite its prestige, amass such riches without major trade ventures? Perhaps challengers paid fees to duel its master?

Amidst the glittering mounds, Wang Xiaorong pointed deeper into the cavern. “There’s another chamber ahead.”

Rounding a bend, they entered a side room—and Wang Xiaorong shrieked. A skeleton sat motionless against the far wall.

Guan Yu approached. The bones, clad in white beast-hide robes, suggested an elderly man who’d died long ago. The durable attire had outlasted its wearer.

**Chapter 4165: Making Arrangements (Part 2)**

Guan Yu maintained composure despite inner turmoil. If discovered as an imposter, he’d be overwhelmed by the manor’s guards. His right hand stayed hidden, clutching a pistol, while his left gripped the庄主令牌 (Manor Lord’s Token)—a symbol of absolute authority.

“This man is my descendant,” Guan Yu declared, pausing to gauge reactions. The assembly remained obedient, long conditioned to Swordless Immortal’s dominance. “After twenty years of searching, he’s found me. To make amends, I appoint him Vice Manor Lord.”

The crowd murmured “Vice Manor Lord” in unison, offering no resistance. Guan Yu continued, “Henceforth, promotions shall follow merit. We’ll recruit fifty new guards.”

When an elderly councilor questioned the need for collective approval, Guan Yu replied, “I wish to govern more collaboratively henceforth—a change inspired by reconnecting with family.”

His words stirred unexpected warmth among the staff, accustomed to their lord’s stern rule. Assigning the three长老 (Elders) to manage affairs during his “seclusion,” Guan Yu distributed funds for manor upkeep before retreating to change attire.

“All set, ‘Swordless Immortal’?” Wang Xiaorong teased as they prepared to depart.

“We must return before Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun worry,” Guan Yu replied.

Du Teng’s attention snagged on a massive greatsword leaning against the wall—over five feet long with a blade two hands wide. Rust coated its surface, but he hefted it effortlessly. “Heavy!”

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “Looks like an iron club!”

“This,” Du Teng said reverently, “is the legendary Dragon-Slaying Sword. Don’t let its plain appearance fool you—it can slice through steel.”

**Chapter 4166: The Greatsword**

The weapon’s history hung thick as Du Teng demonstrated its edge against stone, cleaving rock like soft wood. Its dull sheen belied deadly sharpness, a relic from an age of giants.

As they departed Swordless Manor, the weight of secrets and newfound power accompanied them—the greatsword’s presence a silent promise of trials ahead.
