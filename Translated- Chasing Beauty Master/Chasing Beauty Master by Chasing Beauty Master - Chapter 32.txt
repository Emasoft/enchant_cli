Guan Yu’s hand froze abruptly just before reaching the opening of Feng Xin’s tight-fitting shirt, lingering near the peaks of her chest.

“Heh… Sorry!” Guan Yu awkwardly withdrew his hand, clutching a tissue, his fingers twitching slightly as his gaze flickered over her full bosom. Feng Xin glared at him coldly, her expression rigid.

“Enough. Get out. Go downstairs and find Grandpa. Study hard—don’t forget your promise! You said you’d protect me!” Her voice was icy, devoid of warmth.

“Uh… Right, right…” Guan Yu nodded hurriedly, inwardly grumbling. *Her mood shifts faster than lightning! Back to the ice queen act—this woman’s aura is suffocating!*

“Rest well, Sister Xin. I’ll head down now.” He sniffed and lowered his voice.

“Just go. You’re dripping wet everywhere. I need to shower.” Feng Xin waved him off, propping herself up on one arm.

“Take it slow… Don’t slip! Need help? I could hold you, scrub your back…” He raised an eyebrow teasingly.

Feng Xin’s face darkened instantly, her eyes narrowing in warning.

“Kidding, kidding!” Guan Yu ducked his head and scurried out, muttering, *“This tomboy can’t even take a joke!”*

Once the door closed, Feng Xin’s stern demeanor softened. She bit her lip pensively, then suddenly chuckled—a radiant, heart-stirring smile reminiscent of a blooming peony.

Descending to the third floor, Guan Yu approached Old Master Feng. “Master, I’m ready for the test!”

“Hm… Is Xin’er alright?”

“She’s fine. Just strained her limbs earlier. A quick massage fixed it.” Guan Yu replied calmly.

Old Master Feng eyed him curiously. *This kid’s something else—my granddaughter actually let him touch her?* Aloud, he said, “Good. Sit.” He gestured to a chair.

Guan Yu obeyed, sitting formally across from the elder.

“Our ancestral Bone-Shattering Fist has always been passed down through male heirs. But with Xin’er’s father gone and me too old for more sons…” The old man chuckled wryly. “You’ve caught Xin’er’s eye and suit my tastes. So I’ll teach you.”

“The fist has thirty-six forms, three strikes each, plus eighteen finishing moves. Recall our spar last night—what did you notice?”

Guan Yu licked his lips. “No chance to counter. Too fast… unnaturally fast.”

“Exactly. The Bone-Shattering Fist’s core lies in disrupting balance through rapid combinations before delivering the decisive blow. All martial arts emphasize footwork—without stable roots, any fighter crumbles. Our art overwhelms opponents with speed, breaking their rhythm until they falter. The instant they lose balance…” The old man slammed a fist into his palm.

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up. *A guaranteed KO technique!*

“Three-strike chains create infinite variations. But true power lies in speed, counter frequency, and strike force—these determine mastery. For generations, none have reached perfection.”

As the lecture continued, Guan Yu grew increasingly awed. The principles—precise strikes to vulnerable joints, leveraging inch power for internal damage—seemed almost mythical. Yet he’d witnessed the old man’s blinding speed firsthand.

“Your physique meets requirements, but fundamentals need polishing. We’ll start with Form One’s three strikes and its finishing move.” Old Master Feng rose and led him upstairs to the training room.

Before a wooden dummy, the elder demonstrated slowed-down motions. Guan Yu gaped—*These are the same crude sketches from that office comic book!*

“Don’t underestimate simplicity,” the master chided. “True combat targets weaknesses, not flair.” He guided Guan Yu through blocks and counters. A practice lunge ended with Guan Yu flat on his back, stunned by the technique’s efficiency.

Hours passed in relentless repetition. Sweat soaked Guan Yu’s shirt as movements transitioned from clumsy to fluid. Old Master Feng watched approvingly—*Diligence compensates for talent. Let’s see if this boy’s fire lasts.*

“Enough for today. Progress takes time.” The old man interrupted as dusk fell. “Dinner.”

Checking his phone, Guan Yu blinked—6 PM already. “I’ll fetch Sister Xin.”

As he bounded upstairs, Old Master Feng smiled—perhaps great-grandchildren weren’t so distant a dream after all.

Knocking produced a lazy “Come in…” from Feng Xin’s room.
