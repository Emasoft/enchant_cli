“Otherwise, even if Guan Yu achieves mastery in his studies later, if he remains uncontrolled by the sect and disregards rules, then no matter how formidable his cultivation becomes, it would be utterly useless to our sect.

However, should Guan Yu truly be capable of cultivating mystical arts and later unlock the seal in his mind, he would become a deity proficient in both martial and mystical cultivation. For thousands of years, apart from our founding patriarch, none have succeeded in dual cultivation. If Guan Yu achieves this, it would be a monumental miracle, bringing immense enhancement to the Yunqing Sect's influence.”

After contemplation, Xuan Ming declared, “Guan Yu, I know you cherish freedom and chafe against sect regulations. However, if you agree to several conditions, I shall permit you to learn our sect’s mystical arts.”

Guan Yu fell silent, pondering. Though he deeply desired to learn these arts, what demands might Xuan Ming make? Would they be too stringent? If so, there was no point in further discussion. His interest in mystical arts stemmed mainly from witnessing others’ aerial feats, not an irreplaceable longing.

**Chapter 3109: Conditions**

Noting Guan Yu’s hesitation, Xuan Ming continued, “Junior Brother Lu did speak of your circumstances. For anyone else, I would refuse outright. But you are exceptional—a Realm Sovereign expert deserving my utmost respect.”

“Grandmaster Xuan, what conditions must I accept? Speak them,” Guan Yu replied. He resolved to hear the terms first before deciding.

Xuan Ming stated, “You may learn our sect’s arts without adhering to our rules, provided you become an affiliated disciple.”

“Naturally. If I cultivate the Yunqing Sect’s arts, I am its disciple,” Guan Yu agreed.

“Good. Additionally, you must never act against the sect, collude with the Demon Sect, and must always prioritize the welfare of the common people, conducting yourself as befits an orthodox cultivator.”

In modern terms, this meant being a law-abiding citizen. Guan Yu nodded. “Understood. I can comply.”

Xuan Ming added, “Should the sect face crisis, you must return to aid us. After all, you’ll have learned our arts.”

“Of course. Even without learning your arts, I’d assist if needed. I’ll never betray my teachers or roots,” Guan Yu affirmed.

“Excellent. I shall first teach you the foundational spell ‘Origins of Sword Flight’—the basis for aerial swordsmanship. Master this, then undertake a task for me. Upon completion, I’ll impart advanced techniques.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Grandmaster, this feels like entrapment. Must I perform tasks for each spell learned? Don’t exploit me for trivial errands.”

Xuan Ming chuckled. “You misunderstand. Mastering ‘Origins of Sword Flight’ may take considerable time. Subsequent techniques require this foundation. Moreover, the task I assign is no trifle.”

“What task?” Guan Yu inquired.

“You’ve likely heard of recent Demon Sect movements—their covert gatherings in Yu City pose grave threats. Assist our disciples in investigating them.”

This surprised Guan Yu, yet as a force for justice, he agreed readily. “I’ll help, but there must be no further demands afterward.”

“Ideally, aid us in eradicating this Demon Sect force. If successful, I’ll request Elder Jiu to attempt unsealing your mind.”

Considering the benefits—recovering his lost memories and possibly aiding Zhang Han—Guan Yu consented.

With matters settled, Xuan Ming proposed, “Become my fourth disciple, ranked junior at Tiger Head Peak.”

Junior Brother Lu protested, “This is unjust, Sect Leader! Guan Yu and I share close ties. He should join my school!”

Xuan Ming feigned annoyance. “Your Former Return Peak has dozens of idle disciples! I’ve only three. Why contest this?”

To cultivators, a Realm Sovereign like Guan Yu surpassed gold in value—a coveted guardian and object of reverence.

Xuan Ming’s current guardian, an octogenarian First-Class Mid Sovereign, though preserved by cultivation, showed his age through fading memory and waning vigor. Guan Yu’s youth and power made him incomparably precious.

The sect leader envisioned Guan Yu—potentially dual-cultivated and unsealed—becoming an unmatched guardian, multiplying his own strength.

“This is outright theft!” Junior Brother Lu objected. “I first discovered him!”

Unrepentant, Xuan Ming countered, “Let Guan Yu decide. As my disciple, he’ll enjoy high status. Under you, he’d start as a junior.”

“Senior Brother, this is unfair! Though you lead, Guan Yu belongs with me!”

Xuan Ming dismissed this. “Capability determines suitability. Let Guan Yu choose. My tutelage offers superior advantages.”

The rivals’ fervor amused Guan Yu. Undecided, he weighed Tiger Head Peak’s prestige against Former Return Peak’s accessibility. Though convenience mattered little—he planned brief stays regardless—the choice remained difficult.

Junior Brother Lu made a desperate bid: “I’ll swear brotherhood with Guan Yu, making him an uncle to my disciples!”

Xuan Ming retorted, “Would you prefer an old man’s company or my premier resources? I’ll grant you a treasured artifact from my collection if you join me.”

This offer stunned Junior Brother Lu. To cultivators, rare magical artifacts were priceless obsessions.

**Chapter 3111: The Firebrand**

Veterans like Xuan Ming and Junior Brother Lu hoarded artifacts—some self-forged, others claimed in battle. These objects, especially sentient ones recognizing masters, were cherished beyond measure.

Xuan Ming’s own artifact originated from his youth. After tumbling into a ravine, he found a peculiar foot-long wooden staff. Using it as a splint, he later discarded it into a hearth during convalescence. The staff ignited an unnatural inferno, surviving unscathed—a revelation of its mystical nature. This “Firebrand” became his signature tool, its true potential gradually unlocked through decades of cultivation.
