Guan Yu stood up and descended the stairs, driving his Da Hang motorcycle straight to the Huanye Club. Upon seeing Guan Yu's arrival, Hou Jinshun greeted him with a chuckle, “Don’t worry. The gun is mine. They won’t be able to do anything to me.”

“That’s a relief. I was just concerned about dragging you into this,” Guan Yu replied. His original intention for coming here was to retrieve the gun from Hou Jinshun, fearing that the police might trace it back and implicate him. He planned to surrender the firearm and claim sole responsibility, thereby absolving Hou Jinshun of any involvement.

However, it turned out the retired soldiers Hou Jinshun associated with at Huanye were no pushovers. After a single phone call, Hou Jinshun emerged unscathed. Assured that no trouble would follow, Guan Yu prepared to leave. As he departed, Hou Jinshun advised, “Call me if you run into any trouble.” Guan Yu nodded in acknowledgment.

When the police later confronted Hou Jinshun, his friends—also present at Huanye—stepped forward aggressively. “What the hell do you clowns do all day?” one barked. “Zhang Taiping attacked Hou Jinshun first! He only drew the gun in self-defense and didn’t fire a single shot. You’re arresting people without even understanding the situation? Want me to teach you all a lesson?”

The officers, taken aback by their audacity, quickly realized these veterans weren’t ordinary citizens. After consulting superiors, they confiscated Hou Jinshun’s pistol and left.

Once the police departed, Hou Jinshun’s friend remarked with a smirk, “No worries. Whatever they took today, they’ll obediently return tomorrow.”

Though Hou Jinshun wanted his connections to assist Guan Yu, the latter had declined. Knowing Guan Yu’s capabilities, Hou Jinshun set aside his concerns.

While the firearm incident resolved, the security team remained relentless. Guan Yu’s public beating of their members at the school gate—leaving multiple victims with second-degree disabilities—had drawn widespread attention. Du Zhao, howling in pain during surgery, cursed, “Damn this lousy hospital! What kind of sh*tty anesthetic is this? Trying to kill me with pain?” Unbeknownst to him, his ranting only exacerbated his agony. The surgeons, unsurprisingly, showed no sympathy.

With three fractured ribs requiring surgical repair (fortunately sparing internal organs), Du Zhao lay recuperating, seething with hatred. “That bastard Guan Yu... I’ll make sure he dies,” he vowed. Fearful of retaliation during his convalescence, Du Zhao demanded police protection.

Meanwhile, Wei Hongwei called Guan Yu with crucial intelligence: “Brother Guan, I’ve discovered something—the principal’s wife is keeping a toy boy, who happens to be the police commissioner’s son.”

“Excellent,” Guan Yu replied. “Gather evidence and leak it.” Hanging up, he smirked. Both Zhang Taiping and his wife would soon face utter humiliation.

Wei Hongwei worked tirelessly, first exposing Zhang Taiping and Liu Shuowei’s history of coercing and molesting female students. The scandal exploded, triggering swift investigations by both police and media. As the principal of Kaihuang—a prominent figure—this became prime headline material.

Investigations revealed numerous victims coerced through threats and bribes. Both Zhang Taiping and Liu Shuowei swiftly became police targets. While Zhang remained in custody, Liu was apprehended at the school gates during his escape attempt.

By evening, news of the principal’s wife’s affair broke, sparking fresh uproar. The police commissioner—who had earlier vowed to assist Zhang—found himself besieged by media at headquarters after his son’s involvement surfaced. A furious phone call to his offspring followed.

The commissioner’s humiliation paled beside the principal’s wife, who—while defending her husband to police—had their televised scandal break mid-interview. Zhang Taiping, long aware of her infidelities, simply turned away—his dignity already obliterated.

“This is all Guan Yu’s doing,” Zhang seethed inwardly. He resolved to hire supernatural assassins to eliminate the youth.

As Guan Yu awaited nightfall to visit Du Zhao’s hospital, Yang Conghan called. “Heard the news? You alright? Need help?” Her concern was evident. Guan Yu suspected the Yang family had already intervened—why else hadn’t police tracked his motorcycle?

After instructing Wei Hongwei to pinpoint Du Zhao’s location at Shuangtai Orthopedic Hospital near Kaihuang, Guan Yu declined companionship. “You’d just slow me down.” He dined casually, biding time until midnight.

**Chapter 1946: Making Arrangements**

While police ostensibly hunted him, Guan Yu noted their halfhearted efforts. At midnight, his Da Hang roared through deserted streets like a sprinting cheetah.

Reaching Shuangtai Hospital, Guan Yu strode inside. The quiet lobby offered no challenge, but he realized his oversight—knowing Du Zhao’s location but not his floor. A directory revealed orthopedics occupied the fifth floor.

Approaching the nurses’ station, Guan Yu spotted a stunning young nurse—her nurse’s uniform straining against ample curves—documenting charts. Before he could inquire, a voice called, “Nurse Qing, come here. I have instructions.”

Ducking into a corridor, Guan Yu observed the nurse enter an office where Director Qiu—a lecherous physician—awaited. Through the keyhole, he witnessed the predator’s moves.

“You’ve interned here days now,” Qiu began. “Thoughts on our hospital?”

“It’s wonderful,” replied Qing Ling’er, 18, an earnest rural intern. “Advanced facilities, skilled staff, everyone’s been kind.”

Qiu closed the door. “Want a permanent position here? I could arrange it.” His leer intensified as he pounced. “Just... keep me company tonight.”

**Chapter 1947: White Coat Disguise**

“No! Let me go!” Qing struggled against Qiu’s groping hands.

“Scream all you want,” Qiu sneered. “Who’ll believe you?” Pinning her on the desk, he tore her uniform open—

CRASH! The door flew open. Guan Yu’s fist smashed Qiu’s nose, followed by a brutal beating. “Mercy! Please!” the director begged, bloodied and broken.

After ensuring Qing’s safety, Guan Yu donned a stolen white coat. “Which room is Du Zhao in?”

“I’ll show you,” Qing whispered, trembling but grateful.
