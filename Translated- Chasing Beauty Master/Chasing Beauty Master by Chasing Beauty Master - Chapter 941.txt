“This symbol… Jinhua should have a way to decipher it,” Guan Yu contemplated. Being well-versed demon clan culture, Jinhua might recognize these engravings on the dagger. He decided to consult her after returning.

The demon clan compendium in Jinhua's possession contained extensive records. Perhaps those cryptic symbols' purpose might be explained within its pages.

Yet urgency wasn't warranted. Even if the dagger could break seals, Guan Yu remained undecided – should he prioritize lifting his own restriction first, or Zhang Han's? Moreover, the aftermath required careful deliberation. This demanded prudent consideration.

“We’ll address this later.” Stowing the golden dagger, Guan Yu continued, “Actually, I came seeking Brother Jie’s assistance with another matter.”

“Just speak plainly,” Second-to-Wolf replied. “Between us, formalities are unnecessary.”

Sakura chimed in cheerfully, “Guan Yu, consider my brother your subordinate now. Order him directly. If he disobeys, tell me – I’ll discipline him properly!”

The room erupted in laughter. Second-to-Wolf grumbled, “Sakura! Whose sister are you? Must you humiliate me before others? I’m a top-tier assassin, remember?”

“An assassin to outsiders, perhaps. But Guan Yu’s family! Why preserve pretenses among kin?” she retorted, grinning.

Resigned, Second-to-Wolf shrugged – dignity had long abandoned him anyway.

“DOWN!” The assassin suddenly roared, tackling Sakura as gunfire erupted. Simultaneously, Guan Yu scooped Lan Yu into his arms while kicking Cai flat.

Bullets shredded the windows in a metallic hailstorm. Crouching against the wall with Lan Yu, Guan Yu instructed, “Stay here. Don’t move.”

The pale girl nodded mutely, her world upended – such violence belonged on silver screens, not reality.

Guan Yu assessed: At least two machine gunners outside, possibly more. Across the room, Second-to-Wolf shielded Sakura calmly while Cai lay paralyzed by terror.

“Cai! Crawl here!” Guan Yu barked. But the petrified man remained frozen, trapped in crossfire.

Impossible. The exposed position was lethal. Channeling internal energy through his hands, golden radiance coalesced into an expanding sphere. When it reached two meters wide, Guan Yu launched the blazing orb through the window.

BOOM! The detonation shook foundations. As gunfire ceased, Guan Yu blurred across the room, dragging Cai to safety. “Protect Lan Yu,” he ordered the trembling man before peering outside – an ominous quiet had descended.

Second-to-Wolf met his gaze – silent understanding passed between warriors. Reckless charges invited slaughter. The assassin’s position near the entrance proved vulnerable.

Rising again, Guan Yu conjured a brighter golden maelstrom. With a thunderous release, the energy surge tore through walls and window frames. Seizing the distraction, Second-to-Wolf darted over with Sakura.

“Damn, they found us fast,” the assassin growled. Sakura remained eerily composed, accustomed to such ambushes.

“Your enemies?” Guan Yu questioned.

“Could be mine,” Second-to-Wolf admitted. “Decades of hits made many powerful foes. Or yours – that human trafficking ring’s remnants?”

Lan Yu trembled, clutching Guan Yu’s sleeve. “Am I going to die?”

“Never while I breathe,” he soothed, stroking her hair.

Sakura knelt beside the frightened girl. “When I was younger, attackers came nightly. I learned – trust your guardian completely. Guan Yu won’t fail us.”

Nodding bravely, Lan Yu swallowed tears.

Second-to-Wolf gestured toward the bathroom. Crawling low to avoid snipers, they reached a hidden panel revealing an opulent safe room – marble fixtures alongside surveillance screens showing wooded rear grounds.

“Sakura’s sanctuary,” the assassin explained. “When I’m absent, she monitors from here.” Two figures appeared on camera – armed intruders skulking through maples.

Through the disguised exit, they emerged into dense foliage. Guan Yu scaled a tree, spotting more gunmen flanking the compound. The paired stalkers ahead became Second-to-Wolf’s prey as Guan Yu reconnoitered – six hostiles visible, likely more hidden.

**Chapter 2408: Enemies (Finale)**

The luxurious panic-room’s western wall dissolved into a manicured grove. Motioning plans, the warriors separated – Guan Yu melting into branches while Second-to-Wolf became shadow itself. Twenty meters east, the duo advanced with pistols raised, unaware of death’s approach.

In his elevated perch, Guan Yu surveyed the kill zone. Three shooters covered the front, another team circling west. Silent as autumn leaves, the hunters became hunted.
