“Aunt, listen to me,” Guanyu said. “I’m extremely wealthy, and this amount means nothing to me. Besides, the place you’re staying is owned by family—I didn’t spend a dime. Moreover, if I were ever kidnapped, the ransom demanded would be at least hundreds of millions. Given that Shuangshuang saved my life, even giving her tens of millions would be entirely justified.

“Now, for Shuangshuang’s sake, I must arrange for her to study in the city. The best high school here, Kaihuang High, has many connections of mine—even the teachers know me. If Shuangshuang studies there, she’ll be well taken care of. Since you refuse my direct help for her, the only way I can express gratitude is by giving you this money.”

“Alright, Mom, let’s agree,” Shuangshuang chimed in, munching on a large apple. “I know Big Brother is super rich, and he doesn’t care about tuition. After all, I saved two ultra-wealthy people! We should accept their kindness, hehehe.”

The aunt sighed, shooting Shuangshuang a mock-stern look. “You’re so shameless, accepting favors like this. Hasn’t Guanyu helped us enough already?” Her half-smile betrayed her approval.

Xue Jing interjected, “Guanyu, why don’t we handle Shuangshuang’s school transfer this afternoon? Once she recovers in a few days, she can start at Kaihuang High directly.”

“No problem at all. One phone call will settle it,” Guanyu replied confidently. A call to Pan Xiaoxia would arrange everything—transferring a student was trivial.

He also planned to introduce Shuangshuang as his sister to the Yu Gang members at Kaihuang High. With their protection and placement in Pan Xiaoxia’s class, her education would far surpass rural schools.

“If you dislike dorm life, you can stay at Qiaoyuan District anytime,” Xue Jing offered. “Guanyu’s house is huge. I’ll prepare a room just for you.”

Guanyu shot her a puzzled glance. He’d never considered housing Shuangshuang there—the residence was for those closest to him. Would their relationship remain purely sibling-like if she moved in? Yet Xue Jing’s uncharacteristic openness hinted she’d already accepted the possibility, even if Shuangshuang grew closer to Guanyu.

This was Xue Jing’s first welcoming gesture toward a new woman. Even when Yingzi arrived, she hadn’t been this generous. Clearly, she favored Shuangshuang.

Guanyu studied Xue Jing’s expression, gauging her sincerity. While he’d welcome the lively girl, others’ reactions concerned him. For now, Xue Jing seemed earnest.

Privately, Xue Jing understood resisting Guanyu’s expanding circle was futile. Shuangshuang’s affection was obvious, and Guanyu adored her quirks. Moving her to the city would deepen their bond, especially as she clung to him like a plaster. Accepting her early smoothed the inevitable.

Besides, Xue Jing genuinely owed Shuangshuang. Without her, she and Guanyu might not be safe today. This was repayment.

“Don’t let her trouble you. She’ll board at school,” the aunt insisted.

“It’s no trouble. Let her decide,” Xue Jing said warmly. “If the dorm’s uncomfortable, just tell me.”

Chapter 2690: What Are Your Requirements?

“Thank you, but I’ll board,” Shuangshuang said cheerfully. “On weekends, I’ll visit Mom. It’s more convenient, and I won’t disturb your home with all those sisters-in-law around, hehehe.”

Guanyu scratched his head, amused by her teasing.

“Once you’re healed, study hard at Kaihuang,” Xue Jing said. “I’m technically a student there too, though I skip classes with Guanyu often. You’ll do better than us!”

The door opened, and Yang Conghan entered with a girl. “Guanyu, this is Dandan. I’ll leave you to discuss. The auction house needs me.” After greetings, she departed.

Dandan, a sweet-faced young woman with a bob cut and sporty attire, handed Guanyu a file. “Here’s my resume. Am I tutoring her?” She pointed to Shuangshuang.

Guanyu skimmed her impressive credentials—straight-A student, numerous certifications. “You’re 21?” he confirmed.

“Yes. We’re around the same age, right?” Dandan replied, dimpling.

“With your qualifications, why tutor instead of joining a company?”

“Sister Yang asked me. I’m considering postgraduate studies later.”

Guanyu nodded—Yang Conghan’s influence secured this gem. “Payment’s settled? Start tomorrow, syncing with school curriculum.”

“Sister Yang covered everything. I’ll arrive at 8 AM daily.” She handed a supply list.

Guanyu assured her they were prepared. Shuangshuang gestured to a crammed cabinet. “Do we need all this?”

“Call me ‘sister,’ not ‘teacher,’” Dandan said.

“Okay, Dandan-jie!” Shuangshuang grinned, relieved her tutor wasn’t a strict elder.

“One last request: a lectern with a whiteboard. Easy to find.”

“Done,” Guanyu said. After finalizing arrangements, he and Xue Jing left.

Later, Guanyu called Pan Xiaoxia. “Pan-jie, long time! I need a favor—transferring my sister to Kaihuang’s honors class.”

“Your ‘sister’? Since when?” Pan teased.

Xue Jing chuckled over the car speaker. “She’s a beauty with a special bond.”

Pan backtracked, “Jing, don’t mind my jokes! I’ll handle it. Send her details. Busy with meetings—bye!”

Chapter 2691: A Golden Opportunity

Meanwhile, Feitianlang—abandoned in an alley after a failed ambush—was hospitalized. Bill Lin, fuming at his disappearance, ranted, “Did that bastard flee with my 50 million and the treasure map?”

A bodyguard speculated, “Master, he might’ve been killed for the map. Guanyu’s the only one bold enough to strike at Yang’s auction.”

Bill Lin seethed. “Guanyu, I’ll destroy you!”

Fang Su interjected, “Tonight’s the Ma family casino opening. A perfect chance to strike.”

“Forget celebrations! I’ve lost everything!”

“Guanyu’s vulnerable there. We can ambush him.”

Bill Lin’s eyes narrowed. “Finally—a way to crush him!”
