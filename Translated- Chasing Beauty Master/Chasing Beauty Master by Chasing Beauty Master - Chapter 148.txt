“In the detention center, spending some money through connections outside to bribe the wardens here could still buy me a few more carefree days! Once the court sentences me in half a month—whether life imprisonment or a fixed term—the real agony will begin with those over-a-decade-long prison years.

Over ten years...those underlings outside will probably fade away with time, everything changed.” Xiao Xiong thought to himself.

“What case? Complicated?” Guan Yu asked casually, tilting his head toward Xiao Xiong.

“Nothing major. Just...bad timing. Gotta accept misfortune! Ah, can’t mess with power. Let’s eat—no more talk!” Xiao Xiong tore off a chicken leg and handed it to Guan Yu.

Without ceremony, Guan Yu snatched it with his teeth. After a few chews, his eyes widened. “Hmm...not bad! Even has barbecue cumin flavor! Nice!”

Xiao Xiong chuckled, punching Guan Yu’s shoulder. Lowering his head with a trace of resignation, he continued eating.

“How do you buy this stuff? From the wardens? How much per meal?” Guan Yu asked between bites.

“Need to apply. What you’re eating costs 100 a day. His kind”—Da Long nodded toward Xiao Xiong—“runs 300 daily.”

Ruthlessly overpriced, yet reasonable for those seeking comfort here.

“Not even expensive! You gangsters outside can’t afford this? Just gnawing cornbread?” Guan Yu tilted his head curiously.

“Boss...we can manage a day or two, but after a year or two? Same cornbread either way. Why waste money? Besides, even the rich dare not splurge here.” Da Long grinned, pointing at other inmates.

Several prisoners glanced over before hurriedly lowering their heads to eat.

Obviously, if the cell boss chewed steamed buns while underlings feasted on fish and meat, such mockery couldn’t exist. Who’d dare provoke misfortune?

Lower-ranking inmates, to live decently without bullying, had to notify families to pay for extra meals as tributes to cell bosses. Even with delicacies, when would it ever reach them?

As Guan Yu ate, another commotion erupted next door—crashes and shouts.

“Fuck your mother! Can’t you let anyone live in peace? You’re relentless!” A middle-aged man’s voice roared, followed by plastic bowls smashing.

“This bastard’s full but won’t let us eat! Beat him!”

Clangs and Niu Le’s roars echoed as the brawl raged for another ten minutes.

“Son of a bitch! Stubborn mule! Why fight me over sleeping spots?!” The Cell 335 boss glared at Niu Le, surrounded by injured underlings.

Niu Le’s face was bruised, shoulders and knees dislocated and swollen. Yet his expression remained fierce, lips pressed tightly as he stared back.

“Screw it! Kill this bastard! I’ll risk it all! If he wants a death match, let’s go all out!”

As the boss cursed, Niu Le suddenly lunged forward, ramming his shoulder like a tank into the man’s chest, slamming him against the wall.

When the boss’s head snapped forward from the impact, Niu Le smashed his skull against the man’s nose and elbowed his gut.

“Shit—help the boss!” Cell 335 descended into chaos again.

Hearing the ruckus, Xiao Xiong frowned wryly at Guan Yu. “Your friend’s a troublemaker who won’t yield! Could he really overthrow them?”

“Hard to say. That cell boss is a slick old-timer—here over a year without sentencing. Rumor says he’s a drug lord.” Da Long murmured, eyeing Guan Yu.

“Let him stir the pot.” Guan Yu shrugged, unconcerned.

Unable to intervene, worrying was pointless. Niu Le’s unyielding nature made submission impossible. Let him endure hardships—Guan Yu could only aid him later.

**Chapter 364: A Restless Night**

Xiao Xiong gave Guan Yu a puzzled glance but stayed silent. If Guan Yu wasn’t worried about his own brother’s safety, why should he care?

“Eat up.” Guan Yu grinned.

Both shrugged and focused on their meals. Unlike Cell 334’s calm, Cell 335’s curses and thuds pierced through the walls.

“Beat him to death! This lunatic’s ruining our peace!” The bloodied boss clutched his broken nose—crimson staining his lips like grotesque lipstick.

He marveled at this bull-like newcomer who’d fought him thrice in hours. Despite injuries, the man showed only superficial wounds while his own crew lay crippled.

A chill ran through the boss. He feared no challenge—only nuisance. To sleep tonight, he needed to crush this threat.

“Break his legs! Let’s see his arrogance then!”

Hearing this, Guan Yu’s chopsticks paused. Murderous intent flashed as his face darkened—the drug lord meant business, and Niu Le’s stubbornness spelled disaster.

Xiao Xiong noted Guan Yu’s expression. “They won’t kill here—no gain. But broken legs are inevitable.”

Guan Yu clenched his chopsticks. “Then he’s dead.”

The snapped bamboo echoed his rage. Xiao Xiong startled at Guan Yu’s ferocity.

The underlings hesitated—exhausted and unfed, yet loathing Niu Le’s disruptions. They rained blows on the curled-up man, who glared defiantly.

“Bastard! If you don’t finish me, I’ll kill you!”

The boss’s eye twitched. This madman’s relentless vendetta unnerved even a seasoned drug lord. Cold determination settled as he approached.

Niu Le’s face was swollen, joints ballooned, yet he spat blood and grinned. “Changed your mind? Giving me your spot? Too late—I’ll still wreck you!”

Xiao Xiong admired, “Your friend’s got spine. I’d like to meet him.”

Guan Yu smirked proudly. “You will.”

A sickening *crack* interrupted. Guan Yu’s fists whitened. “They broke his leg. I’ll remember this debt.”

Xiao Xiong marveled—Niu Le hadn’t screamed despite the agony.

The boss had stomped Niu Le’s swollen knee, bending the leg at ninety degrees. Sweat-drenched and pale, Niu Le rasped, “Fuck you...I’ll return this twice over!”

“You won’t get the chance.” The boss raised his foot again, but underlings pulled him back—fearing repercussions.

Guan Yu exhaled when silence followed. At least Niu Le lived—he’d vowed to bring him home safely.

**Chapter 365: Yard Time**

Xiao Xiong observed Guan Yu’s loyalty with respect. Even facing murder charges, the man cared for his brother—a rarity.

But his own future looked bleak. Would they meet again beyond these walls?

Da Long, ever observant, offered cigarettes. “After-meal smoke—bliss like immortality.”

As they puffed, others watched enviously—such luxury here was unheard of.

“Yard time tomorrow noon,” Da Long mentioned. “You can see your friend then.”

Guan Yu’s lips curled—a smile that chilled Da Long. “Better lay low here, or...”

Guan Yu dismissed the warning. Even the police chief treated him respectfully—why fear guards?

Xiao Xiong reclined, studying Guan Yu. No ordinary student—his composure hinted deeper secrets.

Night deepened with snores. Guan Yu lay staring at the tiny window, mind wandering to lovers: Liu Shilei’s tearful face, Du Xiaojuan’s clingy innocence, Feng Xin’s stern allure, Zhao Jing’er’s frail dependence, Wen Qing’s complicated entanglement...

He chuckled, marveling at his crowded romantic life, then winced as his cigarette burned fingers.

The tossed butt flew toward Xiao Xiong, who flicked it away mid-air.

“Habit,” Xiao Xiong explained. “Always alert in the underworld.”

Guan Yu offered another smoke. They leaned back, flames glowing in the dark, two men bound by circumstance, sharing silence and smoke.
