“Where to?” Guan Yu asked in confusion. “Aren’t you leaving? This is all I can do! Whether you survive depends on yourself—but don’t forget our agreement!” Hong Feng spoke slowly, yet a flicker of excitement gleamed in his eyes. After all these years, it was finally beginning!

Guan Yu stared at the massive gate of the trial grounds and suddenly understood. Her eyes blazed with unrestrained fervor—the exit! She could finally leave!

“I know!” In a flash, Guan Yu appeared before the gate, her gaze alight with exhilaration. Hu Xiaohai stared at the portal opened by demon blood and murmured, “Ruthless… but I like it!”

Guan Yu glanced back at the Demon City she had inhabited for six years, feeling an unexpected pang of nostalgia. Perhaps she was born for slaughter. With a sigh, she turned and plunged into the gate. Hong Feng watched her figure vanish, a perfect smirk curving his lips. Now, he only needed to wait—for the Asura King to break the barrier. But would Guan Yu obey? Of course not! Yet Hong Feng remained confident; no one would gamble with their life. He had forgotten, however, that Guan Yu was no obedient child.

As she free-fell, Guan Yu suddenly caught the thick metallic tang of blood. Below her yawned a vast pool brimming with crimson. The stench of gore billowed upward. Moments from impact, she twisted midair, cracked her Soul-Devouring Whip, and struck the blood pool. The explosion propelled her backward using wind elementals, hurling her to the pool’s edge.

She landed safely, drenched in blood but relieved to avoid immersion. Surveying the churning reservoir, she realized it collected the lifeblood of every demon slain in the trials. Why would Hong Feng hoard this? To drink? Was he a vampire? The mystery lingered.

Suddenly, the blood churned into a vortex. A colossal serpent’s head emerged, its emerald eyes glaring. Guan Yu’s heart raced—had she fallen in, she’d have been its snack!

She gaped at the serpent, speechless. A new creature at last!

Hu Xiaohai nearly fainted sensing Guan Yu’s thoughts. Who gets excited facing a giant serpent? Was she mad?

The beast’s scarlet scales mirrored the blood pool. Its flared gills hissed, venomous fangs glinting. The serpent’s meter-thick body coiled menacingly. Guan Yu cursed her luck—awakening this monstrosity upon arrival!

Preparing to fight, she knew the odds were against her. Environment, strength—everything favored the serpent. Conserving energy was crucial. Yet the creature didn’t strike. Was it sated? Or did she taste foul? As she puzzled, the serpent suddenly lunged. Its jeweled head loomed closer, forcing Guan Yu to shut her eyes.

Legends claimed snakes couldn’t see stillness. She’d test it. The serpent sniffed her, then withdrew into the pool. When Guan Yu opened her eyes, all was calm. Hu Xiaohai wondered why it spared her but stayed silent—her safety mattered most.

Baffled, Guan Yu scanned the area. Had the serpent truly ignored her? No matter. Time to leave.

Unseen, the serpent resurfaced, trailing her with a bloody wake. At the trial grounds, Hong Feng smirked at the sealed gate and demon corpses. “Ming. Clean this up.” He vanished, leaving his subordinate trembling. Ming shook his head at the dead. “Weakness doomed you. Blame yourselves.”

Guan Yu crept down a dim path, alert. Hu Xiaohai materialized beside her. “Why emerge?”

“The whip’s boring!” he grumbled. Guan Yu sighed, letting him follow.

She halted abruptly. Hu Xiaohai collided with her. “What?”

“Look.” She pointed ahead—a bottomless abyss spanned by a half-foot-wide stone bridge.

Hu Xiaohai gaped. “Afraid of heights?”

She thwacked him. “I’m strategizing! What if something attacks mid-cross?”

She hurled a rock. It struck the opposite wall, triggering emerald lights—countless glowing eyes. Vampire bats swarmed! Guan Yu tackled Hu Xiaohai as the flock surged past.

The creatures—bloodthirsty denizens of darkness—circled hungrily. Guan Yu and Hu Xiaohai slashed through the onslaught, but the bats pressed fiercer.

A bat clawed Guan Yu’s arm. The scent of blood enraged the swarm, diverting their focus. “We’ll exhaust ourselves!” she realized. “Get us across!”

Hu Xiaohai nodded. Guan Yu lashed her whip, herding bats aside as he conjured a water-element barrier. Safeguarded, they edged onto the bridge.

**Chapter 1568: Primordial Beast**

The bridge trembled. A colossal shadow loomed—a bat-king with golden eyes, steel claws, and venom-dripping fangs. The bat horde bowed as their sovereign approached.

Hu Xiaohai bristled. “Dare they ignore me, a primordial beast?!”

“Can you handle it?” Guan Yu mind-spoke.

“Easily!” He vanished, slaughtering bats stealthily. The enraged king swooped, but Hu Xiaohai dodged, raking its hide. “Its hide’s too tough!” he complained.

Guan Yu rolled her eyes. “Trap them!”

She summoned light, blinding the bats. Hu Xiaohai merged dark and wood elements, weaving toxic vines into a cage. The bat-king shrieked, poisoned veins blackening its wounds.

“Enough!” Guan Yu pressed onward. The bridge shook anew—a gargantuan spider blocked their exit. Trapped between two apex predators, Guan Yu grimaced. “Each take one!”

As Hu Xiaohai engaged the bat-king, Guan Yu faced the spider—six blade-like legs, venomous fangs, and pitiless eyes. Desperation sharpened her focus. Survival hinged on this duel.

**Chapter 1569: The Abyss**

The spider lunged. Guan Yu whipped backward, but the bat-king broke free, cornering them. Maddened by pain, it screeched—a death pledge.

Between abyss and twin terrors, Guan Yu’s mind raced. “Hu Xiaohai! Distract it!”

He teleported, clawing the bat-king’s eyes. The spider advanced, its web sealing the exit. Guan Yu’s grip tightened on her whip. One misstep meant oblivion.
