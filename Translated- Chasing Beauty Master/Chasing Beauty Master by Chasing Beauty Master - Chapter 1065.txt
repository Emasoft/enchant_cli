“Early this morning, our boss took his wife on an overseas trip. They booked the flight tickets last night and are probably already airborne,” the assistant explained.

Bierlin glanced curiously at the assistant, well aware that Ma Tong wished to avoid him. Whether the trip was genuine remained uncertain. “Are you telling the truth? You’re not colluding with Boss Ma to deceive me, are you?” he pressed.

“Of course not! How could you think that, Young Master Bierlin? The boss truly went traveling. He said last night’s events shook him and he needed to clear his mind,” the assistant replied, his expression shifting slightly.

Since the assistant insisted, whether Ma Tong was truly absent or merely avoiding him mattered little. Bierlin had no intention of forcing a meeting. He had lowered himself to seek Ma Tong’s cooperation against Guanyu, but this evasion made their alliance impossible. If Ma Tong refused, Bierlin saw no reason to remain courteous.

“To be rebuffed by a mere assistant—how infuriating!” Bierlin cursed.

Fang Su added, “That ‘mere assistant’ treated you kindly compared to his disdainful glare at me. The man couldn’t be bothered with me—utterly arrogant.”

“Let him strut! We’ll see how long his pride lasts,” Bierlin snarled before dispatching men to cause trouble at Ma Tong’s casino, including sending Luo Bo.

Though still recovering from injuries, Luo Bo’s fingers itched at the mention of a casino. A compulsive gambler like Second Only to Wolf, he jumped at the chance to play. Upon arriving at the lavish establishment, he sighed ruefully: “Such a splendid place—what a waste to destroy it.”

After exchanging chips through the novel system where players settled debts only upon leaving, Luo Bo ascended to the gaming floors. The second and third levels buzzed with energy—crowded tables, roaring patrons, and bustling attendants. Though not China’s grandest casino, its brazen openness surprised Luo Bo, accustomed to underground dens.

Drawn to a lively Pai Gow table, Luo Bo observed before claiming an empty spot. “New banker here! Five million stake, no upper limit—place your bets!” he announced. Skilled at covert card-switching enhanced by cultivation, he dominated initial rounds. To avoid suspicion, he deliberately lost occasionally before engineering conflict—stomping on a player’s foot.

“Fucking blind? Watch where you’re stepping!” the man roared.

“Just a misstep. Barking like a dog?” Luo Bo taunted.

The enraged player kicked over a chair. “Foreign trash! I’ll teach you consequences!” He began summoning allies via phone.

Luo Bo feigned fear while provoking: “Go ahead! Call your army! Let’s see if Ma Tong’s casino permits brawling!”

Security led by Ju Niu arrived. “What’s the disturbance?” the hulking enforcer demanded.

Luo Bo whined, “This brute overreacted to an accidental step!”

The victim countered, “Your thug insulted me after damaging my shoes! Where’s Ma Tong?”

“Resolve disputes outside,” Ju Niu ordered coldly. “Disrupt again, you’re expelled.”

Seizing the moment, Luo Bo overturned a table. “Arrest him!” Ju Niu commanded. When guards approached, Luo Bo struck one—a calculated blow breaking the man’s nose despite appearing feeble.

Chaos erupted as bystanders gawked. Ju Niu, recognizing cultivation-enhanced techniques, barked, “Subdue him!”

Luo Bo retreated theatrically. “Five against one old man? What honor is this?”

The stomped man jeered, “Beat them all if you’re so tough!”

“You’ll regret this!” Luo Bo warned, continuing his charade of fearful defiance while awaiting the perfect escalation.
