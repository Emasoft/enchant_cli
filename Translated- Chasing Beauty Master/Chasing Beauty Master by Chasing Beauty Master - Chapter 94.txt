The trip to Yunnan and Myanmar had resolved the issues with Du Xiaojuan’s father, and now that their whereabouts were discovered, it no longer posed a significant problem!

“Aunt said Mom and Dad are furious. They want me…to return home in a few days. But…I don’t want to go back!” Du Xiaojuan furrowed her brows, pouted her lips, and looked timidly at Guan Yu.

These days spent with Guan Yu had been her most relaxed and cherished—filled with care, protection, and affection. How could she bear to leave? Moreover, they had chosen this place together, pouring all her energy and hopes into decorating their little nest. The thought of abandoning it now was unbearable.

“If you don’t want to return, perhaps visit them when you’re ready. After all, they’re your closest family. Given time, they’ll calm down. Everything can be resolved through discussion,” Guan Yu said lightly, offering casual reassurance.

Du Xiaojuan blinked in confusion. Though she often seemed naive, she wasn’t foolish. She knew how vehemently her family opposed her relationship with Guan Yu. His nonchalant attitude puzzled her deeply.

“But…”

“It’s fine. If needed, I’ll go back with you. Don’t worry—I’ll handle everything.” Guan Yu patted her back, took her hand, and led her to the couch.

“So…you’ll really fix this? I don’t want to leave. I plan to stay right here in our little nest forever!” Du Xiaojuan tilted her head, pursing her lips earnestly.

“We’ll stay. I keep my promises,” Guan Yu declared solemnly.

In the past, Guan Yu lacked the confidence to make such bold claims. But now, he felt no hesitation. He had accumulated enough leverage to negotiate with Du Xiaojuan’s family and compel her father, Du Xueheng, to reconsider him.

The Yunnan-Myanmar journey had not only brought Guan Yu immense wealth but also shifted his perspective. Witnessing the influence of figures like Li Yunshan and Old Master Feng ignited new ambitions.

When he first gained his supernatural abilities, Guan Yu had been a penniless youth fixated on earning money. After successive wins in gemstone gambling, financial worries vanished—the red jade stored with Li Yunshan alone could make him a billionaire. Now, wealth mattered less.

Power—his own power, a status commanding universal respect—was his new pursuit. With his abilities, achieving this seemed effortless. A brief period of growth would propel him to prominence, a day he believed was near.

“Tomorrow morning, call your parents and set a time. We’ll meet them and settle this,” Guan Yu said softly, turning to her.

Though Du Xiaojuan hadn’t voiced it, he sensed her lingering anxiety. Her cheerful facade couldn’t mask the helplessness in her eyes, especially when faced with losing her sole anchor. He understood her fears.

Meeting Du Xueheng meant little. The man had once called him “brother” and even joked about introducing his daughter to him!

**Chapter 228: I Like You**

Now capable of resolving Du Xiaojuan’s family issues, Guan Yu gladly sought to ease her burdens.

“Tomorrow? You’ll…come with me?” Du Xiaojuan’s luminous eyes fixed on him.

“Yes. It’s nothing serious,” he reassured.

“But…what if my family forbids me from leaving or living with you?” she mumbled dejectedly.

“They won’t. Trust me—I’ll handle it all.” His confidence was unshakable.

“Really? No problems? Let’s sleep. Stop overthinking.” Guan Yu tenderly pinched her cheek.

Nodding, Du Xiaojuan trailed behind him upstairs like a devoted shadow.

The newly purchased villa came fully furnished, yet she had meticulously recreated the decor of their rented home. Entering the bedroom, Guan Yu felt an indescribable familiarity and warmth.

Gazing at the room’s familiar layout, he suddenly longed to embrace her. The word “home” flashed in his mind—cozy, comforting.

“Let’s wash up and sleep.” He guided her to sit on the bed.

“Guan Yu…what happened to your arm?” Du Xiaojuan gasped, clutching his bruised, swollen forearm as he removed his shirt.

“It’s nothing.” He smiled at her anxious, wifelike concern, warmth flooding his heart. This—being someone’s everything—was what he craved.

Holding her soft, warm body under the covers, his mind settled into tranquility.

Du Xiaojuan curled against his shoulder, a leg draped over his waist. Guan Yu marveled at the irony: this pure, innocent girl shared his bed nightly like a devoted wife, yet nothing intimate had occurred. Few would believe it.

“Guan Yu…I…I like you!” After turning off the lights, she mustered courage to whisper into his ear.

“Huh?” Startled from reminiscing about his pre-ability hardships, Guan Yu froze.

“Do you like me?” She lifted her face, eyes glinting like black jewels in the dark.

“Of course.” How else could he endure nightly embraces with such sweetness?

“Then…why haven’t you…done *that* with me?” Her timid voice quivered with shy confusion.

Guan Yu’s throat tightened. He coughed awkwardly.

Why? Fear she’d regret it later. Fear he couldn’t promise lifelong commitment. Fear her discovering his relationship with Liu Shilei, or Liu leaving upon learning of Du Xiaojuan. These hesitations anchored him: *If you can’t protect her, don’t hurt her.*

“You’re…considering me, right?” she murmured.

“You’re still naive. If you mature and regret this, you might resent me. I want you to remember me fondly, not with hatred.” His苦笑(laughter) carried bitterness.

“But…doesn’t it hurt you?” She hugged his arm tighter, having often noticed his physical reactions.

Books claimed men suffered when suppressing desires. Yet Guan Yu’s consideration moved her profoundly.

“I’d never blame you. Even if you discard me someday, I’ll stay as your little maid, serving you. Okay?” Her tentative words pleaded.

“Little maid?” He blinked, perplexed.

“Well…masters often develop…*closeness* with maids.” She giggled.

“What absurd books are you reading?!” He groaned.

“Books!”

*Damn, what’s this silly girl been consuming?* Guan Yu rolled his eyes.

“Would you let me stay forever? I can’t bear leaving. Without you these days, I felt…empty. Just seeing you, even silent, fills me with joy!”

Guan Yu swallowed, words trapped in his throat.

“Silly girl, if you’re willing, I’ll never let you go.” His resolute tone sealed a vow—to her and himself.

How could he betray such devotion?

“Guan Yu, you’re so good…” Ecstatic, she climbed onto his chest, peppering his nose and chin with kisses before finding his lips in the dark.

Her soft, sweet lips brushed his. A tentative tongue traced his mouth, eliciting a shiver.

*Mmm…* Guan Yu parted his lips, sucking her tongue in. Electric sparks shot through him as he tightened his embrace.

**Chapter 229: Heart-Stopping Beauty**

Du Xiaojuan’s proactive kiss met no resistance. Guan Yu’s hands roamed beneath her pajamas, kneading her pert breasts, thumbing nipples until she arched breathlessly, lips parted in irresistible allure.

Though they’d shared a bed since she left home, Guan Yu had never crossed lines beyond playful foot touches. Now, emboldened by her initiative, he indulged—until desire threatened control.

Breath ragged, he pecked her swollen lips. “Enough…I can’t hold back much longer. Sleep now?”

“No…I’m willing!” She clung like an octopus, eyes shimmering with shy resolve.

*Should I take her innocence? What if she discovers Liu Shilei?* Conflict gripped him.

“Let’s wait until you’re certain—no regrets, no matter what.” His evasion hung heavy.

“But…doesn’t this torment you?” Her whisper trembled as she shifted, feeling his hardened heat press against her.

Even through layers, the sensation ignited her. Heart pounding, she blurted, “I…really don’t mind. Let’s…try?”

*God help me…* Guan Yu’s resolve crumbled.

Before he could respond, she ducked under the covers, yanking his waistband down. A warm hand closed around him.

Exploring curiously, she sniffed, then—giggling shyly—took him into her mouth.

*Ah!* Guan Yu’s spine arched as wet heat engulfed him. Ecstasy surged—*heavenly!*

Her untutored tongue swirled instinctively. Guan Yu flicked the bedside lamp on, guiding her legs to straddle his face.

Blushing fiercely, she knelt above him, his mouth inches from her damp pajama bottoms.

Through thin fabric, he massaged her cleft, each stroke making her shudder.

*Unbearable…just take her!* Yet he hesitated—*wait until after meeting her family.*

Her pajamas slid down, revealing soaked panties. Peeling them aside, he gaped—

In the lamplight, her glistening folds hovered before him. A finger’s touch confirmed her readiness.

*Just a look…a touch…* Rationalizations dissolved as desire triumphed.
