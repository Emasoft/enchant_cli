“The situation is indeed unfavorable,” Chancellor Li stated. “If it were merely the First Prince alone, we would have nothing to fear. With Prince Zou absent from the capital and no allies by the First Prince's side, the threat would be negligible. However, with Jiang Yuankai and Wan Hong supporting him, caution is warranted.”

“Thus I know those imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison are heavily guarded. Rescuing them is nearly impossible,” Minister Qi said. “I’ve come because your men have troops stationed there. If possible, have your people eliminate mine through covert means. This would ensure safety by removing all witnesses.”

Chancellor Li glanced at the Second Prince, who had remained silent throughout Minister Qi’s discourse. “This presents considerable difficulty,” the chancellor feigned concern. “After Prince Zou departed with the official silver, the Second Prince ordered me to dispatch forces against him. Many resources were already expended on that endeavor.”

“As for the troops stationed at the Heavenly Prison’s periphery,” he continued with practiced helplessness, “penetrating the inner prison for assassinations would be improbable. Even if achieved, the opportunity might prove illusory.” Beneath this veneer of cooperation simmered calculated indifference. Though his Imperial Guard maintained close ties with the Blade-Bearing Sentinels and shared barracks, facilitating such operations required only modest effort. Yet Chancellor Li saw no advantage in aiding Minister Qi’s plight – better to let the man founder while observing from safe remove.

The Second Prince finally interjected, “Chancellor Li, we share this vessel. Collective survival depends on mutual aid. I implore you not to let personal grievances cloud judgment.”

“Should the Imperial Guard’s assistance prove crucial now,” he pressed, “consider this: if Minister Qi’s Embroidered Uniform Guard gets absorbed by the Emperor through this incident, your forces alone will bear all future burdens. Every imperial matter will require your direct involvement.”

Minister Qi added, “The Emperor’s design becomes clear – first weakening the Second Prince’s influence by reclaiming the Embroidered Uniform Guard, then targeting your Imperial Guard next. Our fates intertwine irrevocably.”

Chancellor Li’s eyes narrowed skeptically. While the Emperor’s maneuvers warranted vigilance, immediate peril seemed exaggerated. Yet contemplation revealed Minister Qi’s warning held merit – should the Emperor seize control of the Embroidered Uniform Guard, the Second Prince’s remaining leverage would indeed rest solely with the Imperial Guard.

Though privately considering the Second Prince’s declining fortunes and potential need for new alliances, Chancellor Li maintained diplomatic veneer. “This isn’t reluctance but genuine incapacity,” he demurred. “The Embroidered Uniform Guard’s reckless actions, undertaken without preparation, have created irreparable chaos. Does the Second Prince propose alternatives?”

“The optimal solution remains infiltration and elimination,” Minister Qi insisted. “With the imprisoned silenced, the First Prince’s investigation collapses regardless of its thoroughness.” The Second Prince nodded concurrence.

“Assassination within the Heavenly Prison proves no simple feat,” Chancellor Li countered. “My guards patrol only the periphery. Penetration itself challenges possibility, let alone executing covert kills.”

“Mishandling this,” he warned, “could doom both the Embroidered Uniform Guard and my Imperial Guard – a classic case of losing the dowry and the bride.”

Though privately acknowledging feasible intervention, Chancellor Li emphasized potential risks. Should the Second Prince compel action through command, compliance became obligatory – yet consequences would remain unpredictable.

Minister Qi pressed, “Your Imperial Guard maintains close Heavenly Prison ties. This operation shouldn’t prove overly arduous.”

“Simpler days have passed,” Chancellor Li deflected. “Under imperial scrutiny, overt actions court disaster. Prudence dictates strict adherence to protocol.”

The Second Prince’s expression hardened. “Imperial Guard infiltration remains achievable. Spare us dissembling.”

Tension crackled between the ministers, their longstanding rivalry manifesting even in crisis. Chancellor Li’s Imperial Guard basked in imperial favor through palace proximity, while Minister Qi’s Embroidered Uniform Guard accrued field experience through myriad external operations – each faction considering itself superior.

“The Embroidered Uniform Guard’s current debacle stems from reckless improvisation,” Chancellor Li jabbed. “Assaulting the Heavenly Prison to eliminate Master Cao without preparation? Sheer folly.”

The Second Prince’s gaze turned glacial. “This operation occurred under my direct orders. Do you question my judgment, Chancellor?”

“Never, Your Highness,” came the swift retreat. “A momentary lapse in celestial calculation, nothing more. Even sagacious rulers encounter unforeseen currents.”

“Precisely why we require your aid,” the Second Prince leveraged. “Assist not Minister Qi, but your prince. Consider the broader chessboard.”

Chancellor Li’s mask of compliance hid seething resentment. This capricious prince demanded loyalty yet offered none in reciprocation. Memories surfaced of denied petitions during the Cao family affair, compounded by stolen credit for presenting the White Star of Xiling – indignities now compounded by fresh demands.

“Your Highness must recognize,” Chancellor Li countered, “the Heavenly Prison has become bait in imperial trap. Any intervention risks springing the snare. The Emperor anticipates precisely such desperate moves.”

As the Second Prince and Minister Qi exchanged uneasy glances, Chancellor Li pressed his advantage: “The optimal solution requires your imprisoned agents’ voluntary demise. Are they not trained deathsworn? Their self-sacrifice prevents wider contagion.”

“Suicide requires orders,” Minister Qi countered. “Without communication channels...”

“Then establish them!” the Second Prince interjected. “Chancellor Li’s men can convey your command.”

After theatrical reluctance, Chancellor Li yielded: “Given time, infiltration might be arranged. But celestial prison security...”

“Time evaporates!” the Second Prince snapped. “The First Prince probes the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s headquarters with Grand Princess and Wan Hong’s support. Exposure looms.”

Under duress, Chancellor Li proposed compromise: “Let Minister Qi’s deathsworn don Imperial Guard uniforms. Their familiarity with his commands ensures compliance.”

“Unacceptable!” Chancellor Li vetoed. “Their potential blunders would implicate my forces. Let my men bear your message – compliance becomes your agents’ responsibility.”

From his waist, Minister Qi produced a silver talisman engraved with skull motifs – command token for his shadow operatives. “Bearer of this passes unspoken orders. Your courier need only display it.”

As the token changed hands, Chancellor Li concealed triumph. Forced cooperation secured his position while maintaining deniability. The game continued, its pieces moving through smoke and mirrors.
