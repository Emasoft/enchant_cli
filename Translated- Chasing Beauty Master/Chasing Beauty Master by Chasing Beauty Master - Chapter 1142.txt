“However, even without these two, Bill Lin himself would still need to seek others. The suitability of candidates or their ability to convincingly act required considerable effort—this wasn’t a task just anyone could handle.

The individuals undertaking this matter needed psychological resilience. After all, approaching the leather factory’s management to negotiate contracts and present demands was the proper course. Lai Huangsi and Qiu Wanzhang, at first glance, were seasoned veterans of the business world. If these two negotiated with European merchants, no suspicions would arise. For their expertise, Bill Lin resolved to endure their terms.

‘Brother Lai, what figure do you deem reasonable?’ Bill Lin asked through gritted teeth. Though the pair were ideal, their demands required scrutiny. An exorbitant sum would render the deal worthless.

Lai Huangsi exchanged a glance with Qiu Wanzhang. ‘After preliminary calculations, forging identities for myself and Brother Qiu will require substantial gifts to higher-ups—a complex process costing around four million. Factoring in travel and time lost, a total of ten million seems appropriate.’

The audacity of demanding ten million stunned Bill Lin. Such an astronomical figure far exceeded acceptable limits. How could they even voice it?

‘This trivial task isn’t worth such a sum!’ Bill Lin shook his head vehemently. ‘Five million is my offer. At most, I’ll add another million—six million total. Take it or leave it.’

To Bill Lin, six million was generous. After expenses, the pair would net two million merely for a straightforward contract negotiation—a fortune by any measure. Their greed astonished him.

As Bill Lin weighed his options, Lai Huangsi also deliberated. With Young Master Feng still lingering in the restroom, Lai turned to Qiu Wanzhang. ‘Brother Qiu, what say you? Six million—do we accept?’

Qiu Wanzhang scoffed. ‘The famed generosity of the Bill family’s young master crumbles over mere millions? How disappointing.’

Bill Lin knew they sought to flatter him into compliance—a tactic that might have worked before. But after repeated clashes with Guan Yu, he’d grown shrewd. No honeyed words would loosen his purse.

‘The Bill fortune isn’t plucked from trees,’ he retorted. ‘We spend wisely, not wastefully. I invest where value lies.’

His rebuke silenced Qiu Wanzhang. The deal stood at six million—take it or leave it.

Lai Huangsi calculated silently. Split three ways after expenses, each would clear over 1.5 million—acceptable.

Emerging from the restroom, Young Master Feng interjected, ‘Six million suffices. Remember, Bill Lin’s wealth stems from his family, not personal coffers.’

Reluctantly, Lai Huangsi conceded. ‘Very well, for our longstanding partnership and Young Master Feng’s face, I’ll accept this loss. But don’t forget this favor.’

**Chapter 2992: The Plan Begins**

‘Our timeline is deliberate,’ Lai Huangsi drawled, legs crossed. ‘Were this order not urgent, we wouldn’t approach your factory. Your capacity can handle this in ten days with modest overtime—agreeable?’

Lan Ting pondered. ‘Our factory manages the volume, but your 2% defect rate clause is unrealistic. Industry standards allow 5-8%.’

‘Percentages are negotiable,’ Lai waved. ‘Sign today, materials arrive tomorrow, production starts day after. Agreed?’

‘Allow me to confirm our schedule.’ Lan Ting excused herself, leaving the conspirators alone.

Qiu Wanzhang whispered, ‘Aren’t we being too eager? Shouldn’t we complicate matters?’

‘Unnecessary,’ Lai assured. ‘Large orders like this are irresistible. Perform well and reap rewards.’

‘Should we sabotage this batch?’

‘Patience,’ Lai cautioned. ‘Gain trust first. Next order, we strike decisively.’

Their scheme, devised with Bill Lin, involved overwhelming the factory with impossible demands. Initial small orders would build credibility before delivering crippling contracts.

‘After ten smooth days,’ Lai explained, ‘we’ll flood them with massive orders. Our plant insider will fake production numbers. When they fail deliveries, the 20x penalty clause activates—bankrupting them.’

Bill Lin had approved enthusiastically. Calculating potential losses—50 tons of leather at ¥10,000/ton, multiplied twentyfold—Guan Yu’s company would hemorrhage ¥100 million.

**Chapter 2993: Trusting Them**

Lan Ting returned, beaming. ‘Production confirms availability. Materials can start processing immediately upon arrival.’

Lai feigned delight. ‘Excellent! Let’s formalize the contract. Note—failure to deliver incurs 20x compensation.’

‘Twentyfold?!’ Lan Ting paled. Standard penalties capped at 3-5x.

‘Merely incentive for diligence,’ Lai soothed. ‘Your reputation assures compliance.’

Reassured, Lan Ting reviewed the contract. Though stringent, the lucrative terms outweighed risks. With the factory’s current slack period, meeting targets seemed feasible.

‘All appears in order,’ she concluded. ‘Shall we sign?’

‘Your authority suffices?’ Lai probed.

‘Absolutely,’ Lan Ting asserted proudly. Behind her stood the factory’s full backing.

As documents exchanged, Lai and Qiu exchanged triumphant glances. The trap was set.

‘Might we inspect your facilities?’ Qiu proposed, maintaining charade.

‘Of course!’ Lan Ting led the tour, oblivious to the viper in their midst. Her enthusiasm masked the predators circling her factory—a lamb guiding wolves to the fold.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu gathered his gang leaders at the West City stronghold. Recent events—Bill Lin’s school provocations and neglected seized properties—demanded reorganization.

‘Wei Hongwei, confirm attendance,’ Guan Yu commanded from his throne-like chair. The inner chamber buzzed with lieutenants, while outside, hundreds milled in the compound.

Unbeknownst to them, storm clouds gathered—both in leather factories and shadowed boardrooms, where revenge schemes and corporate warfare brewed. The game escalated.
