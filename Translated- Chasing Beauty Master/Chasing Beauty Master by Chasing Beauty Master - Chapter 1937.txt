After entering, Guan Yu gestured for the other party to sit and have tea first, but the visitor refused. Standing motionless by the doorway, the man said, "The Infinite Inn grows emptier by the day. This is a problem. Everyone has formed groups of three or five to seek the treasures of the Eastern Sea. Both the Swordless Inn and Swordless Manor have become desolate of late."

"Additionally," the visitor continued, "Brother Du Teng mentioned he's gathered some forces during his time at the Swordless Inn—including several martial arts experts. If needed, Brother Du said he can dispatch them to serve you at any time." After speaking, the man stood rooted in place, watching Guan Yu intently.

"Oh? Your arrival couldn't be more timely—like delivering charcoal in snowy weather," Guan Yu remarked with emotion. "Brother Du understands me best. Indeed, what I need most now are trustworthy allies—urgently so. If Brother Du's men can assist me, I'll ensure generous rewards. Let it be known: none who come to aid me shall leave unrewarded."

Guan Yu felt like he was fighting alone these days. If real danger arose, Jiang Yuankai and Duan Ruxue would become mere living targets. Only he could truly face enemies. Having reinforcements from Du Teng's side would be ideal—more hands meant greater strength. The Swordless Manor's members were no mere ornaments. Additional helpers would be most welcome.

With so many hostile eyes watching outside, expanding their forces would make potential adversaries think twice before acting.

"I'll return immediately to relay your message," the young man said, turning to leave. "Brother Du also wanted you to know affairs at Swordless Manor are well managed. He suggests staying here a few days until reinforcements arrive before departing."

"Wait." Guan Yu stopped him, producing a gold ingot. "Young brother, you've traveled far to deliver this message. Please accept this token of gratitude."

"You honor me too much," the youth demurred. "Brother Du saved my life long ago and has cared for me since. Serving him is my duty. Were it not for him, I'd have met King Yama long ago."

Guan Yu admired such loyalty. "This is my personal thanks, unrelated to Brother Du. If you'll accept, take it as compensation for your arduous journey through wind and rain."

Seeing the youth's hesitation, Guan Yu understood—such a large gold ingot tempted any man. The internal struggle between desire and propriety was evident.

Guan Yu pressed sincerely, "What's your name, young man?"

"If you'll permit the familiarity, call me Little Tang. My given name is Tang Hu."

Nodding, Guan Yu stepped forward, placing the ingot in Tang's palm. "Buy a good horse. Rush this message back to Brother Du. When he sends reinforcements next time, I hope you'll accompany them—if you dare face the dangers."

"Gladly. This is my duty." Little Tang clasped his fists in salute before departing.

Guan Yu watched him leave, impressed by the youth's integrity. Though slight of build, Tang handled affairs with earnest efficiency. He seemed ideal for intelligence work—scouting or message-running—a rare find.

Originally planning to depart at dawn, Guan Yu now decided to linger in Twin City until Du's reinforcements arrived. Returning to his companions, he announced, "We'll postpone our journey. I've summoned reinforcements for safety amidst so many watching eyes. Let's wait here until they come."

"Of course," Duan Ruxue agreed first. "More help is welcome. We'll rest here properly."

Others nodded assent. Jiang Yuankai approved, knowing his own men from the capital would arrive soon.

At dusk, Guan Yu walked the bustling streets with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi. Suddenly, he spotted a familiar figure. "Xiaorong, isn't that the Right Envoy?"

Indeed, the Right Envoy of Demonic Soul Sect strolled through the crowd—unusual behavior for one who normally shunned noise. The mere mention of the Sect's Left and Right Envoys struck fear across the jianghu. Known for her frosty demeanor and lethal prowess, the Right Envoy's presence here puzzled them.

"Though cold, she wasn't always thus," Wang Xiaorong explained. "A tragic event changed her long ago."

Guan Yu pressed for details, and Wang recounted: "In her youth, she was betrothed to another cultivator—a match envied as celestial. But while pregnant, she discovered his infidelity. When confronted, he beat her cruelly. Heartbroken, she aborted their child and attempted suicide. My father saved her. Though her body recovered, her heart turned to ice. Years later, she slaughtered the couple. Since then, she's been... like this."

Chapter 5091: A Person's Transformation

Guan Yu understood better now. Surviving such trauma required immense strength. The Demonic Lord's timely rescue and guidance had forged an unshakably loyal subordinate. Under his leadership, Demonic Soul Sect had flourished despite orthodox sects' opposition.

As they observed the Right Envoy's solitary figure, Qiqi murmured, "I thought demonic sect leaders were monsters. But seeing her... she seems so lonely."

"Let's invite her to talk," Guan Yu suggested boldly.

"Right Envoy Auntie!" Wang Xiaorong called out.

Turning, the usually expressionless woman's features softened slightly at seeing her sect leader's daughter. They found a quiet teahouse. When Qiqi inadvertently mentioned the past tragedy, Wang tensed—but to everyone's surprise, the Right Envoy responded calmly: "That was long ago. A sorrowful matter."

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu produced a coiled whip. "Right Envoy Auntie, do you recognize this?"

Wang gasped. "That's the Soul-Devouring Whip! Guan Yu, how did you—"
