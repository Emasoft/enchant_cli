When Shuangshuang sat down attentively, Guan Yu said, “Truthfully, I don’t even know what kind of person I am. I’ve forgotten everything from before—because I once lost my memories.”

“What? Really? Then…will you forget even me someday?” Shuangshuang asked in surprise.

Guan Yu smiled. “No. My amnesia was sudden—everything before that day is gone. My current memories only span from when I moved to City A up until now, barely over a year.”

“Oh…I see.” Shuangshuang’s gaze softened with pity. Suddenly, Guan Yu seemed so lonely that she yearned to embrace him.

Without hesitation, she gently wrapped her arms around him and whispered, “Do you remember everything that happened after?”

“Of course. But my memories only cover this short year.”

“Then…keep telling me your story.”

Guan Yu nodded. “All I know is that I seemed to be on a mission in the frigid Arctic when I lost my memories. Later, my sisters arranged for me to live and study in City A. A girl named Xue Jing came with me.”

“What’s Xue Jing to you? How did you meet?” The vinegar in Shuangshuang’s tone was palpable.

“Xue Jing is…my girlfriend, I suppose. I don’t recall how we met—she was already by my side when I woke. She’s acted like my caretaker, even a servant, handling communications with my sisters.”

“And then?” Shuangshuang grew increasingly intrigued.

“Later, I enrolled at Kaihuang High, the most prestigious school in City A. Xue Jing accompanied me. Though they never said why, I knew it was so she could protect me at all times.”

He paused. “At school, I met my desk mate, Lü Mei, heiress of the Lü family, one of City A’s four great clans. Initially, we annoyed each other. But once, a wealthy male classmate harassed her daily. I couldn’t stand it and taught him a lesson. After that, Lü Mei warmed up to me, and…we somehow became a couple.”

“Another one? Didn’t Xue Jing get jealous?” Shuangshuang traced circles on his chest with her finger.

Guan Yu hesitated—why hadn’t Xue Jing minded? Only she knew. “She didn’t. She accepted Lü Mei naturally.”

“Later, I befriended Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo. They’ve stood by me through life and death. Then I met Lan Yu, a girl I encountered by chance. It felt fated—she followed me everywhere, waiting outside places she couldn’t enter. Once, during a heavy rain, she stood for over two hours. I thought she’d left, but when I went out, she’d collapsed. I took her to the hospital, and…things grew ambiguous between us.”

“Another? You still haven’t mentioned Sister Ling’er! How many are there?” Shuangshuang’s eyes widened.

Guan Yu苦笑ed. Lan Yu wasn’t truly his girlfriend—their relationship never crossed lines. Her devotion mingled with gratitude; without his aid, her family’s business would have crumbled.

“Lan Yu’s father is a tycoon who faced ruin. After I helped stabilize their family, she stayed out of gratitude.” He downplayed their bond.

“You don’t need to explain. One more or less makes no difference to you, right? You’re just stringing her along.” Shuangshuang saw through him.

It was true—could he abandon Lan Yu? Every attachment felt irreplaceable.

“Later, I met a pop star named A Mei,” Guan Yu said quietly.

Shuangshuang gasped. “A Mei? She’s my idol! Years ago, she was everywhere—the whole world knew her! You know her?”

Guan Yu had nearly forgotten A Mei’s fame. Know her? She’s mine.

“After a concert, A Mei vanished. Rumors said rivals killed her out of envy. People believed it—she’d disappeared completely.”

Guan Yu smiled. “Rumors lie. A Mei’s alive, well, and living in my home.”

“Don’t tell me she’s also…” Shuangshuang stared, incredulous. How many women could one man juggle?

“Yes, A Mei’s my girlfriend. She enjoys her peaceful life away from fame.”

“Tell me everything!” Shuangshuang begged.

“I didn’t recognize her due to my amnesia, but she knew me—claimed I’d saved her life before. She became a star hoping I’d see her search. Even if I had, I wouldn’t have remembered.”

Shuangshuang’s eyes reddened. “She endured so much…I ache for her.”

Guan Yu nodded. The entertainment world was ruthless—A Mei’s rise through pure talent was rare. She’d borne immense pressure to find him.

“How did you reunite?”

“At her City A concert, Wei Hongwei dragged me along. A Mei spotted me in the crowd and nearly lost composure. She insisted on moving in, recounting our past. Though I recalled nothing, she quit stardom to stay with me.”

“Memories don’t matter—you’re together! How beautiful!” Shuangshuang clasped her hands, as if praying for A Mei’s happiness.

Guan Yu expected jealousy but found only admiration. Shuangshuang had been a devoted fan.

She leaned closer. “Handsome Brother, can I meet A Mei?”

“Anytime.” He patted her head.

“Yay! I’ll tell Sister Ling’er—she’s a fan too!”

“What about Yang Conghan? The top heiress—how gorgeous is she?”

“I met Yang Conghan at Flower Night Club, where Ling’er works now. She lured me there—her father, the Yang patriarch, had a cultivation deviation, leaving him comatose. They’d heard I possessed a Boundary Sovereign Bead, which can revive the dead. She vowed to become my woman if I used it to save him.”

“Wow! She must be stunning! What’s this Bead?”

Guan Yu hesitated. “I obtained it pre-amnesia, after slaying a demonic cultivator in an Arctic ice cave. It emerged from his corpse.”

“Demons? Are we in a sci-fi movie?” Shuangshuang giggled.

He sighed—mortals couldn’t grasp the cultivation world. “It’s real, but my memories are fuzzy.”

Omitting Jin Hua and Zhang Han’s complexities, Guan Yu concluded his tale.

“How do all your women coexist? No jealousy?”

“They’re harmonious.” Guan Yu boasted.

“I don’t believe it! So many rivals—they must feud!”

Unbeknownst to him, Shuangshuang wondered if she’d fit into this harem.

“See for yourself when we visit A Mei.” He stood. “It’s late—time to sleep.”

Returning inside, Ling’er shot him a peculiar glance. Earlier, the group had debated why she hadn’t pursued him—a conversation halted by their entrance.

Mei Mei teased, “Brother Guan, your entourage is impressive!”

“How’d you know?” Shuangshuang blurted.

“Ling’er told us!”

Guan Yu shot Ling’er a mock-stern look, embarrassed before his conservative aunt and uncle.

His aunt pressed, “Guan Yu, we were asking Ling’er why you two aren’t closer. Don’t you want more?”

Ling’er tugged her mother’s sleeve, flushing.

Guan Yu faced the question squarely. “It’s not about me. Ling’er seeks a certain life—I want her happiness. That’s all.”

Shuangshuang gazed at him adoringly, already claiming him as hers.
