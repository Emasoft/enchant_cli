Wang Zhen grimaced and said, “Brother Yu, under normal circumstances, cheating wouldn’t be an issue. But you know how it is since that new dean took over. Especially after you kicked him out of the classroom, that old turtle has been targeting our class. Not only did he move up the exam date, but he also decided to activate all three surveillance cameras in every classroom. Under those three cameras’ watch, we’ll be completely exposed—every move monitored. Damn it, I’ve never heard of exams requiring cameras before. That bastard’s deliberately trying to screw us over.”

Nearly every university classroom had cameras installed, but they were rarely activated. This time, to everyone’s surprise, they were turned on.

Needless to say, this was Liu Gang’s doing. He’d anticipated their cheating attempts and cut off all escape routes.

After some thought, Guan Yu relaxed.

“And that old coot even declared that anyone caught cheating will be expelled immediately,” added a student from the crowd.

“Exactly! That old turtle doesn’t want any of us to pass,” Tian Hao said indignantly. “Most of us here barely attended classes. With zero participation points, what’s the point of taking exams? We’re doomed to fail. I say we go all out—take that bastard out today so he can’t proctor. Then negotiate with other teachers. Everything’ll work out.”

The idea lit up the room. Cheers erupted as students volunteered money, manpower, even women to “exhaust the old fool to death.”

Guan Yu couldn’t help but admire their creativity. Truly, universities bred talent—even the “honey trap” strategy found novel applications here.

When the clamor subsided, Guan Yu raised his hands in a calming gesture. Instant silence fell over the dorm—a testament to his authority, for which Wang Zhen deserved much credit. Guan Yu acknowledged this with an appreciative glance.

“Your ideas have merit,” he began, “but none are optimal.”

“Big Bro, you’ve got a better plan?” Wang Zhen’s eyes sparkled.

Nodding, Guan Yu continued, “Since that old turtle wants revenge on our class, let’s cheat right under his nose. Wouldn’t that be more satisfying than beating him up?”

The group quickly grasped his meaning, laughter rippling through the room in agreement.

*So you’re the dean? We’ll cheat in front of you, leave you empty-handed, and watch you rage helplessly.*

Yet a problem soon emerged.

“Brother Yu, those three cameras cover every blind spot. With two proctors present, even a fly couldn’t escape notice. How can we possibly cheat?” a student shouted.

“A fly?” Guan Yu’s eyes suddenly gleamed. Earlier, he’d boasted that as long as Liu Gang didn’t interfere mid-exam, he’d ensure no one failed. At the time, he’d had no concrete plan—just intended to use his powers with favorable circumstances.

The complaint now gave him direction. A scheme crystallized in his mind.

“Leave those worries to me,” Guan Yu said confidently. “First, who’s our top student?”

Without an academic reference, cheating would be pointless. Unless they smuggled out test papers for Luo Cheng’s crew—but that would mean dropping out together.

Fortunately, the answer surprised him.

Unanimously, the group named Zhao Jing’er—the quiet girl who’d never missed a class except during her Beijing trip with Guan Yu. Her meticulous notes and focused attendance made her the class’s academic pillar. Many male classmates sacrificed gaming time to “borrow” her notes or accompany her to the library.

Having spent years hospitalized before meeting Guan Yu, Zhao Jing’er cherished her campus life intensely. Her academic excellence, once surprising to Guan Yu, now made perfect sense.

“But Brother Yu,” a student worried, “will Sister Jing’er agree to help?”

Before Guan Yu could respond, Wang Zhen snorted, “Dumbass! How many times must I say it? Sister Jing’er is Brother Yu’s woman—they’re living together! Of course she’ll help!”

**Chapter 560: Underhanded Deeds**

“Living together?” While others showed no surprise, Guan Yu looked shocked.

He smacked Wang Zhen’s head. “Who said we’re cohabiting? We’re roommates! Don’t spout nonsense and ruin her reputation!”

The difference between “cohabitation” and “roommates” was vast—the former implying romance, the latter mere coexistence.

His explanation fell on skeptical ears. To the students, the distinction meant nothing—separate beds or rooms couldn’t prevent nighttime visits. Their envy remained undisguised.

Earlier, Wang Zhen had beaten up anyone pursuing Zhao Jing’er, claiming to protect “Brother Yu’s flower.” Though initially disbelieved, Guan Yu’s admission validated Wang Zhen’s claims—along with other juicy details leaked during drinking sessions with Niu Le.

“Brother Yu,” someone pressed, “is it true all the school beauties live with you?”

Trapped by salivating classmates, Guan Yu glared at Wang Zhen, who avoided eye contact.

“Want to pass exams or not?” Guan Yu deflected. “Scram so I can plan our cheating strategy!”

The threat worked instantly. Soon only Guan Yu, Wang Zhen, and Tian Hao remained.

Exhaling, Guan Yu fixed Wang Zhen with a smile.

Wang Zhen jumped up. “Brother Yu! Just remembered—student council duties! Tian Hao, let’s go!”

They bolted, not waiting for repercussions.

“Wait!” Guan Yu barked.

Pausing at the door, Wang Zhen forced an ingratiating smile. “Urgent business, Brother Yu! Unless it’s critical...”

“What urgent business? I’ve got a task. Is Zhu Lin still in the student council?”

Relieved, Wang Zhen stayed near the exit. “Zhu Lin? That genius! He’s a core member now. Why ask?”

“You said he’s a computer whiz?”

“Absolutely! Hacked countless private photos of campus beauties. Our members’ exclusive福利!”

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes. “Including Wenqing’s?”

“Never the sisters-in-law!” Wang Zhen waved frantically. “Just some decent-looking girls’ unpublished shots—bikini photos! Want to see?”

“Are their figures better than my girls’?”

“No match!”

“Then why bother? Get lost. Tell Zhu Lin to meet me at the chairman’s office.”

As Wang Zhen left, he shot Guan Yu a knowing look—clearly suspecting secret dealings.

Guan Yu didn’t bother correcting him.

**Chapter 561: All Preparations Set**

“Brother Yu, you wanted me?” Zhu Lin entered the office, his chubby frame wobbling.

“Sit.” Guan Yu set down a magazine.

The computer genius obeyed nervously. Though Guan Yu rarely appeared on campus, his legends proliferated. Zhu Lin had joined the student council precisely to approach this enigmatic figure.

“Relax,” Guan Yu smiled. “You’re my brother. I need a favor regarding exams.”

Zhu Lin straightened. “That new dean troubling you? Need him gone?”

“Exactly.” Guan Yu’s expression turned serious. “I don’t care about expulsion, but others do. This is my responsibility.”

Zhu Lin’s admiration grew. “What do you need?”

“During our exam, alter the camera feeds. Can you make it undetectable?”

Zhu Lin’s eyes crinkled with confidence. “Easy. They’ll see nothing.”

After finalizing details, Guan Yu treated Wang Zhen and Tian Hao to dinner before visiting Liu Shilei’s dorm. Guilt over neglecting her led to an afternoon of passion until classes ended.

Dinner was cooked by Du Xiaojuan at the villa—a surprise development. Only after nighttime activities with Wenqing did Guan Yu learn the truth: Du Xiaojuan was trying new ways to attract him since he remained passive.

Contemplating whether to finally act on her feelings, Guan Yu drove to Luo Cheng’s office the next noon.
