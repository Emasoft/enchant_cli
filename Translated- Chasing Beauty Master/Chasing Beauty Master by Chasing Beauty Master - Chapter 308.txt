“Wu Lan’s face stiffened as she said coldly, ‘Didn’t anyone explain the rules to you when you came in?’”

“What rules?” Guan Yu asked, puzzled.

“Here, you belong to no one. Whoever picks you up when you’re alone becomes your owner. I’ve taken a liking to you tonight, so you’re mine now. No one will dare claim you!” Wu Lan declared imperiously.

“Uh...”

Goddamn, so that’s the rule. No wonder those people were bickering outside earlier—this was what they were discussing.

What the hell is all this?!

“Come with me!” Without waiting for a response, Wu Lan grabbed Guan Yu’s hand and dragged him in a particular direction.

Guan Yu’s head throbbed as he debated whether to knock her out. If he didn’t, he’d become a plaything, a laughingstock. If he did, he’d be sabotaging Chu Hong’s operations here. After all, in a way, he was the club’s owner. Causing trouble by attacking a guest would tarnish its reputation.

After much deliberation, he abandoned the idea of incapacitating Wu Lan.

Fine, he’d play along for now—gather intel, but sleeping with this middle-aged woman? Never.

Wu Lan pulled Guan Yu into a room where four women lounged, each accompanied by a man.

Guan Yu’s face twitched.

Holy shit! Those were the same four men who’d entered earlier. Seeing them nestling against those women made his organs ache in sympathy.

One was haggard, another caked in makeup like a plastered wall. A third was grotesquely obese, her flab jiggling. The last resembled a cylinder—uniformly thick from top to bottom, a marvel of disproportionality.

Guan Yu marveled at how these men could stomach such company. Being mounted by these women would be worse than prison sodomy!

By comparison, Wu Lan—a fading beauty with lingering charm—was almost tolerable.

“Lanlan, we’ve been waiting! We’d planned for five men, but they got lost. Be patient—we’ll send replacements soon,” the cylinder-shaped woman tittered.

“I found my own!” Wu Lan declared triumphantly, yanking Guan Yu forward.

Laughter erupted.

“What’s wrong?” Wu Lan frowned.

“Lanlan, this is what you get for being late. Look at what you’ve picked—how can he compare to ours?” the obese woman sneered.

“At least mine can satisfy me all night!” Wu Lan retorted.

Wu Lan’s confidence only amplified the mocking laughter.

“You don’t believe me?” she snapped.

“Lanlan, even four of him might barely last the night with you. One? He’d be dead by morning!” the cylinder woman jeered.

Were he not posing as staff, Guan Yu would’ve slapped her. The insult was unbearable.

Wu Lan, having felt Guan Yu’s strength firsthand, glared. “Laugh now. Tomorrow, when I’m glowing with satisfaction, you’ll weep!”

The women exchanged glances. Wu Lan’s poise and reputation as a socialite icon lent her words weight. Yet beneath her elegant facade lay a voracious appetite.

“Is he really that good?” a heavily powdered woman asked.

“Jealous? He’s mine tonight,” Wu Lan gloated.

“If he’s as potent as you claim, I’ll steal him,” another teased.

“You wouldn’t dare!” Wu Lan hissed.

“We’re here to shed our socialite masks—to indulge. Let me have him tonight. You’ll have other chances,” the woman pleaded.

“The rules are clear—outside these doors, we’re strangers!” Wu Lan refused.

Negotiations escalated until the women offered bribes—a coveted handbag, favors—to claim Guan Yu.

“Enough!” Guan宇 interjected. “When did I agree to service you?”

He turned to leave.

“Stop!” Wu Lan commanded. “You’ve offended everyone here.”

“So?” Guan宇 sneered. “You’ll force me?”

The women exchanged predatory glances.

“If you prefer resistance, we’ll oblige,” Wu兰 purred.

“Five of us against you—quite stimulating,” another added.

“Fuck this.” Guan宇 stormed out.

**Chapter 780: The Favor**

Humiliated, Guan宇 sought the restroom. Mid-relief, a mocking voice interrupted.

Four effeminate men surrounded him. “Think you’re special, pretty boy?”

Guan宇’s temper snapped. “Out of my way!”

A fight ensued. Guan宇’s fists flew, leaving the men battered on the floor.

“Pathetic,” he spat, exiting.

**Chapter 781: I’m His Woman**

Entering Chu Hong’s office, Guan宇 confronted her. “What’s your game?”

Chu Hong sipped wine, smirking. “You wanted the truth. Now you’ve seen it.”

“You’re testing me?”

“And you failed—until now.” She approached, draping arms around his neck. “But I’ll always be your woman.”
