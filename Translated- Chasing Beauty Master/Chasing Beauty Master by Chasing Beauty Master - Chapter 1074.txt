“Then you all barged in, and they took my friend hostage and fled through the back door. They threatened to kill my friend if we dared notify you. That's why I lied when you first arrived – I had to protect my friend's life.”

The Poisonous Widow spun her tale with such conviction she nearly convinced herself. Fang Su initially wanted to add more fabrications but held his tongue, knowing Lin Qiaoqiao already disliked him. Though he silently applauded the Widow's audacious lies, he decided against fueling the fire.

Faced with these claims, Lin Qiaoqiao couldn't reasonably arrest everyone present without concrete evidence linking the two suspects to the Fang family.

Out of options, Lin Qiaoqiao recalled someone who could help. Stepping outside, she dialed Guan Yu. “Guan Yu, you're amazing! I caught those two,” she began, never missing a chance to flatter him.

“Good job, Captain Lin. You’re as efficient as ever,” Guan Yu replied.

“It’s all thanks to your accurate intel. I never imagined they’d flee to the Fang residence. But the Fangs claim no connection, and I lack evidence to arrest them. What now?”

“Take the suspects for interrogation and close the case. Leave the rest to me – this is personal between the Fangs and me,” Guan Yu said coldly.

**Chapter 2746: Extorting Money**

Though uncertain of Guan Yu's plans, Lin Qiaoqiao delighted at the prospect of Fang Su's downfall. “Fine, I’ll take these suspects and wrap up here,” she agreed, hanging up.

Returning inside, Lin Qiaoqiao announced, “Since you deny involvement, I’ll take these two for questioning. Take them away!”

Without resistance, the officers escorted the suspects out. Watching their departure, the Poisonous Widow sighed deeply.

Fang Su wiped sweat from his brow. “That was too close, Aunt! You shouldn’t have brought them here – you nearly ruined us!”

“Nonsense!” snapped the Widow. “My loyal men needed shelter after getting injured working for you. Where else should they go?”

She then turned to Ah Gou, who frantically gestured his explanation. While Fang Su remained baffled, the Widow nodded. “So a car blocked the bridge temporarily? The police found us so quickly because someone tracked us – Guan Yu, no doubt.”

“He planned this in advance,” she mused. “Blocking the escape route shows he’s leaving no loopholes.”

“Wait!” she exclaimed suddenly. “If Guan Yu knows we sent those men, he won’t stop here. Right?” She looked at Fang Su.

The young master paled. “Exactly! Guan Yu never forgives enemies. He’ll retaliate – probably extort money at minimum.”

Fang Su knew Guan Yu’s nature well – wealthy yet avaricious, always finding ways to profit from their conflicts. “That police captain’s his old flame too. He helped her get promoted.”

The Widow’s eyes widened. “We need defenses – now!”

As they strategized, Old Master Fang sat gasping on a sofa, clutching his chest. “Father!” Fang Su rushed over.

“Just... startled...” the patriarch wheezed.

The Widow sneered at her brother-in-law’s weakness. “The crisis passed. I lost two valuable men, yet you’re the one trembling? Pathetic.”

“Take him to rest,” she ordered. “Leave Guan Yu to us.”

**Chapter 2747: Preserving Lives**

Outside, Guan Yu finalized plans for his assault. Learning the police had withdrawn, he sped to the Fang estate in Hou Jinshun’s SUV.

“Tell Fang Su I’ll storm in three minutes,” he told guards.

Panicked reports reached Fang Su: “Guan Yu’s here with hundreds! More cars arriving every second!”

“We’re finished!” Fang Su cried. “The Yu Gang’s student thugs fight like demons!”

The Widow smirked. “My experts could handle thrice their number. Let them come.”

“But Guan Yu’s cunning! He wouldn’t come unprepared!”

“You’ve lost your nerve,” she scoffed. “Face him – I’ll be your shield.”

After evacuating the patriarch, they approached the gates. Fang Su’s legs trembled at the sight – three hundred Yu Gang members floodlit by entrance lamps.

“Fang Su,” Guan Yu called calmly. “Enjoy your overseas vacation?”

Bolstered by the Widow’s presence, Fang Su retorted: “You bring mobs to my home? Where’s your respect for law?”

“Law?” Guan Yu sneered. “Your men shot at me publicly. The police need evidence – I don’t. This ends tonight.”

**Chapter 2748: Mutual Assessments**

Guan Yu studied the unfamiliar woman behind Fang Su. “That middle-aged woman – can you gauge her strength?” he whispered to Xue Jing.

“At least Second-Class Superior, possibly First-Class,” she murmured. “The mute man’s Second-Class too.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. Fang Su’s new allies explained his boldness. “They’re the masterminds behind today’s attack.”

Xue Jing added, “Her cultivation’s unorthodox – likely new First-Class. The mute’s definitely Second-Class.”

The Widow’s rise through lucky breaks and ruthless tactics had forged her formidable reputation. Now she watched Guan Yu with predator’s eyes, confident her elite forces could crush his student army.

Yet Guan Yu stood unfazed. Though outmatched in martial prowess, his strategic mind whirred. Tonight’s confrontation would test more than brute strength – it demanded wit, audacity, and that special Guan Yu flair for turning tides.

The standoff crackled with tension, two forces poised like storm clouds before thunder. Somewhere, a cricket chirped. Then hell broke loose.
