“A question—let me think.” Jin Hua tapped her forehead lightly with a small finger, as if genuinely pondering.

After a moment, her eyes brightened. “Why did you say Laila was lying? Which part of her story didn’t add up?”

“………………”

Guan Yu and Ah Cai exchanged exasperated glances. They’d assumed Jin Hua was analyzing why Laila had lied to them, but instead, she was fixated on pinpointing the exact falsehood—and still hadn’t figured it out. Jin Hua, usually sharp as a tack, seemed oddly off her game today.

Ah Cai explained, “From the moment Laila entered, she kept observing us. She claimed to work at a car company, but those are large corporations. Today’s Saturday—even if overtime happens, it’d be for factory workers, not office staff like her.”

“Agreed,” Guan Yu nodded. “Go on.”

“When Laila came in, she was guarded. But Laili was overly enthusiastic, especially the way she looked at you…” Ah Cai trailed off, casting a wary glance at Jin Hua.

“Keep going. It’s fine—don’t be so jumpy.” Jin Hua waved off his hesitation.

Ah Cai continued, “Laila noticed her sister Laili’s excessive warmth toward you, Guan Yu. The peculiar look in Laili’s eyes betrayed her crush. That’s why Laila grew wary of us.”

“Well analyzed. Keep it up.” Guan Yu encouraged, impressed by Ah Cai’s alignment with his own thoughts.

Ah Cai nodded. “Out of respect for her sister, Laila eased up slightly but still lied about her job. When Jin Hua said we were tourists, Laila immediately questioned why two men and one woman would travel together—heightening her suspicion. Then, Guan Yu asked how she learned Mandarin. Everything she said after that was a lie.”

**Chapter 2276: Exchange with a Head**

Ah Cai reiterated his points, emphasizing Laila’s inconsistencies.

Jin Hua frowned. “How could you tell she lied? What’s the point of her fabricating such trivial details?”

“No direct gain or harm—she simply didn’t trust us,” Guan Yu clarified. “She claimed to love Chinese culture, studied it for years with an ex-boyfriend, yet her flawless Mandarin is implausible. Even foreign professors with decades of study rarely achieve such precision. Her accent? Pure Beishi standard. I’d bet she’s a native.”

“But Laili said they’re from Wakoku! How could her sister be Beishi?” Jin Hua gasped.

Ah Cai looked equally stunned. Though he’d sensed deception, he hadn’t considered Laila’s true origins. Guan Yu, having lived in China, recognized the nuances, while Ah Cai—kidnapped years prior—had grown rusty.

“This proves one thing: Laila isn’t Laili’s sister.” Guan Yu abruptly U-turned, speeding back toward Laili’s home.

“If we’re right, Laili’s in danger,” Ah Cai said grimly. Jin Hua paled. Could an impostor have fooled even Laili?

“Hold on!” Guan Yu barked as the car screeched around corners.

“Why’d it take you so long to realize something was wrong?” Jin Hua fretted.

“Something felt off, but I dismissed it as her disliking visitors. Now it’s clear—we’re too late. Pray Laili’s unharmed.”

As they neared Laili’s street, Guan Yu spotted her convertible parked ahead. He slowed, parking discreetly.

“Stay in the car, no matter what. Keep the line open.” Guan Yu activated his earpiece and grabbed a bundled jacket from the trunk. He pricked his finger, diluted the blood with water, and splashed it on the fabric to mimic a severed head.

Marching inside, he found Laili bound and gagged, the impostor gripping a knife.

“Stop there, or she dies,” the fake Laila sneered.

“I brought what you want. Release her first.”

“Toss the head here. If it’s Ah Cai’s, I’ll let her go.”

“And risk you killing her anyway? Not a chance.” Guan Yu’s calm defiance unnerved her.

“You’ve no leverage. I’ll slit her throat and vanish.”

“Try it, and my snipers outside will drop you before you blink.” Guan Yu bluffed, noting her flinch.

The impostor edged behind Laili. “Call off your men, or we all die!”

“No need for extremes. Let’s trade peacefully.”

**Chapter 2277: Hostage (Part 1)**

The standoff intensified. Laili’s terrified eyes pleaded with Guan Yu, who maintained his steely composure.

“Prove these snipers exist!” the impostor challenged.

Guan Yu smirked, dropping the fake head. “Why else would I step out earlier? To arrange backup.”

The bundled fabric spilled innocuous contents—rags and a water bottle.

**Chapter 2278: Hostage (Part 2)**

The impostor scoffed. “You’re bluffing. I’m not afraid to die!”

“Then why hesitate?” Guan Yu countered, noting her grip tightening on the knife. “Kill her, and you lose your shield. My men will storm in. Either way, you lose.”

Silence stretched. Sweat beaded on the impostor’s brow. Guan Yu pressed, “Let her go, and walk away. No one needs to die today.”

A tense beat—then the knife clattered to the floor.
