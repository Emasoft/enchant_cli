“Your observational skills aren’t bad, kid. We indeed always take this route, and this path is known only to the six Peak Masters of the major peaks. Others have no idea it leads directly to the back mountains of Yunqing Mountain,” Lu said with a chuckle.

Guan Yu grew curious. A small, trampled trail was clearly visible here. If Elder Lu only came occasionally, the path shouldn’t have been worn down so thoroughly.

The crushed bamboo leaves on the ground indicated frequent use. Guan Yu pressed, “Elder Lu, does Elder Jiu truly live alone in the back mountains of Yunqing Mountain?”

“Correct. After his punishment, he was confined here to guard the Ancestral Hall in the back mountains. He’s forbidden from leaving and spends his days tending to it.”

“What mistake did Elder Jiu commit to deserve such a harsh punishment?”

“Ah, that’s a long story.” Elder Lu walked ahead as he spoke. “During the tenure of Yunqing Mountain’s previous sect leader, Elder Jiu was the sole heir to the leadership. But during a battle against the Rain Demon Sect, a demoness escaped. When Elder Jiu pursued her, he not only failed to capture her but... developed feelings for her. Upon returning, the sect leader stripped him of all cultivation and banished him to guard the back mountains indefinitely.”

“What? Such a minor transgression warrants a lifetime of confinement and losing his cultivation? That’s cruel!”

“The full details remain unclear. By the time I joined Yunqing Mountain, Elder Jiu was already imprisoned here.”

Guan Yu asked again, “Elder Lu, aside from Elder Jiu, does anyone else reside here?”

“Yes—a single attendant. Though the back mountains are vast, only those two dwell here.”

Guan Yu deduced the trail must have been worn by the attendant. He refrained from further questions, aware Lu wasn’t oblivious to the path’s obvious existence. Perhaps Elder Jiu himself secretly descended the mountain at times.

As they reached a perilous stretch—a sheer cliff on one side and a vertical rock face on the other—Guan Yu eyed the narrow, foot-wide path nervously. “Elder Lu, isn’t this too dangerous?”

“Stay close behind me, and you’ll be fine,” Lu replied calmly, leading without hesitation.

After gingerly traversing the cliffside, they faced a dead end. Guan Yu frowned. “Is this the back mountains? There’s nothing here!” The barren surroundings offered only jagged rocks and scant vegetation.

Lu pointed across the chasm. “The true back mountains lie beyond this cliff. We must cross here.”

Guan Yu gaped at the 20-30 meter gap. “You can’t be serious! Without sword-flight or wings, it’s impossible!”

Peering over the edge into the foggy abyss, Guan Yu shuddered. “Hold tight,” Lu ordered, gripping his arm and stepping off the cliff.

“Elder Lu, wait—!” Guan Yu screamed as they plunged—only to find themselves suspended midair. Trembling, he looked down at the swirling mists beneath their feet.

“Close your eyes if you fear it,” Lu advised, walking forward as if on solid ground. Guan Yu obeyed, realizing an unseen force upheld them.

When he dared open his eyes, he saw Lu striding atop clouds while mystical energy buoyed him. After the harrowing crossing, Guan Yu wiped sweat from his brow. “What magic did you use? Sword-flight is restricted here!”

Lu chuckled. “I used no spells for myself—only to keep you aloft. Observe below.”

After squinting, Guan Yu spotted twin iron chains hidden in the mist. “So that’s how you crossed! But who installed these?”

“Noticed them, did you? Sharp eyes.” Lu smiled. “Let’s hurry. The sect leader will arrive soon.”

Ahead loomed an imposing black-gated compound—the Ancestral Hall. “Elder Jiu lives well for a prisoner,” Guan Yu remarked.

Lu nodded. “Though stripped of power centuries ago, his secluded cultivation here may have surpassed even the sect leader’s strength.”

“So he’s Yunqing’s foremost expert?”

“Debatable. Other elders exist. Remember—address him as ‘Grandmaster Jiu.’ We need his favor today.”

Entering the courtyard, they found a white-robed figure sweeping leaves with detached motions. Lu bowed. “Grandmaster Jiu, forgive our intrusion.”

The figure kept its back turned. “What brings you to this dull place?”

“We’ve come to discuss this youth—Guan Yu, the sect leader’s new disciple. He seeks dual cultivation.”

Guan Yu bowed. “Greetings, Grandmaster Jiu.”

Turning, the elder revealed a shockingly youthful face despite his gray hair. “You!” Guan Yu blurted. “I expected an ancient man, not someone in his thirties!”

Unmoved by flattery, Jiu assessed Guan Yu. “A prodigy—a界尊 (Jiezun) master so young? Why is he a disciple, not a guardian?”

“He wishes to cultivate both martial arts and magic,” Lu explained.

Jiu’s eyes sharpened. “Dual cultivation? Dangerous, yet... intriguing.”

As they entered the Ancestral Hall’s shadowy interior, Sect Leader Xuanming arrived, panting. Jiu snorted, “You only visit when needing favors.”

Inside, rows of ancestral tablets loomed. A deaf-mute attendant gestured a welcome before withdrawing.

Xuanming sighed. “Last I saw that boy, he was knee-high. Time flies.”

The three elders exchanged weighted glances. Guan Yu sensed centuries of unspoken history thickening the air like the mists outside.
