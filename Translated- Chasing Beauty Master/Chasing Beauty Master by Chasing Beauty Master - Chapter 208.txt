Guan Yu’s face began to pale, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. His brows furrowed slightly, an expression of pain flickering across his features—a clear sign of energy depletion.

Gao Wei knew nothing of “energy depletion.” All she knew was that a man was intently treating her illness, devoid of any ulterior motives or carnal intentions.

Remembering Guan Yu’s domineering yet gentle care earlier, a faint smile touched her lips.

When Guan Yu slowly opened his eyes, he caught sight of that smile. Though subtle, it was utterly captivating.

“I’ll see if I can find any medicine,” he said, rising. Clad only in loose shorts, he stepped out, having discarded the bulky quilt that hindered his movement.

Watching his broad, sturdy retreating figure, warmth flooded Gao Wei’s heart. How comforting it felt to be cared for.

Since entering the entertainment industry, she had fought alone—guarding against scheming rivals, fending off lecherous predators, preserving her integrity in a world of moral decay. Who could understand the sacrifices she’d made?

Yet since meeting Guan Yu, she no longer felt solitary.

He had first saved her from motorcycle gangsters. Then, he’d risked imprisonment by confronting Park Xu for her sake. Now, shielding her from Bai Jie and confronting Feng Minglun… Gradually, she’d grown accustomed to his protection.

But all feasts must end. Guan Yu would eventually leave. The thought brought an ache to her chest, a reluctance she couldn’t voice.

Her gaze dimmed until voices outside startled her. After a brief silence, the lights flickered, plunging the room into momentary darkness. When Guan Yu returned, still in his shorts, he explained, “The landlady just came back. All stores are closed, so she’ll bring clothes tomorrow. We’re staying tonight—you’re in no state to go out.”

“Oh,” Gao Wei murmured tonelessly.

“No cold medicine, but drink this ginger-infused Coke.” He handed her a steaming cup. When she didn’t move, he frowned. “You’re improving, but this’ll ward off the chill.”

“I’m not wearing clothes,” she hissed through gritted teeth.

Guan Yu chuckled awkwardly. “It’s nothing I haven’t seen before. Drink up.”

She nearly threw the drink in his face.

*Achoo!*

Karma struck—this time, it was Guan Yu sneezing. Even the sturdiest man falls ill eventually. Given his icy lake plunge, inadequate heating, and energy-draining treatment session, his congestion seemed inevitable.

After discreetly “borrowing” electricity to recharge his energy, he considered using his healing system—until Gao Wei’s whisper froze him:

“Why… why don’t you join me?” Her cheeks burned as she gestured to the electric blanket. “It’s freezing out there.”

The courage this required astonished even her. He’d saved her twice over—from drowning and illness. How could she let him shiver in the cold? Moreover, his weakened state after treating her…

They’d simply share a bed. Nothing more. Yet even this thought felt dangerously naive, given their scant clothing.

“I’ll stay here,” Guan Yu lied.

*Achoo!*

Another sneeze—genuine this time.

“Stop being stubborn!” Gao Wei scolded. “But no funny business, understand?”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” he vowed, climbing gingerly onto the bed.

Their hearts raced in unison. Guan Yu stared rigidly at the ceiling, bodily reactions betraying his calm. Gao Wei’s pulse fluttered like a trapped sparrow.

Sleep? Impossible. The air thickened with unspoken tension.

“Let’s talk,” Gao Wei finally blurted.

“Okay,” Guan Yu replied hoarsely. Though experienced in such situations, proximity to this barely-clad beauty eroded all composure. The narrow bed forced intimacy—every shift brought skin contact, electric and unbearable.

Alarmingly, Gao Wei’s temperature seemed to rise. A quick system scan relieved him—not fever, but…

His own body burned. Every breath carried her scent, intoxicating as any aphrodisiac. Restraint grew agonizing.

When Gao Wei asked about the trusting landlady, Guan Yu seized the distraction: “Would thieves pay upfront like I did? Besides—” he grinned—“we’re trapped here half-naked.”

Gao Wei flushed, mind stalling at his teasing. Why mention their state now? The fragile détente shattered.

Silence reclaimed the room. Guan Yu’s traitorous body refused calm. An itch between his shoulder blades offered brief distraction—until turning revealed Gao Wei’s heaving chest, barely concealed.

“Pe—pervert!” She lashed out, feet connecting with his groin. He caught her ankle just in time, but the quilt tumbled away, leaving them exposed—a man and woman in underwear, staring wide-eyed.

His gaze traveled downward. Lace-trimmed purple panties veiled dark curls. Blood roared in his ears.

Another scream erupted as Gao Wei noticed his arousal. Frenzied kicking ensued, but Guan Yu blocked every strike. When she lunged to push him off, he grabbed her neck—and they tumbled to the floor, lips locked, bodies entwined.

For one dizzying moment, warmth and softness overwhelmed him. Only the cold floor pierced the haze.

Gao Wei scrambled back to bed, burying herself under covers. “Disgusting! Disgusting!” she chanted, trembling fingers confirming her body’s humiliating response.

Guan Yu sighed at his throbbing member. “Sorry, old friend,” he muttered, retreating to a chair.

In the darkness, Gao Wei’s timid voice emerged: “Guan Yu?”

He didn’t answer.

The room’s chill gnawed through Guan Yu’s quilt. Despite his healing system’s warmth, emotional frost lingered.

**Chapter 519 Shared Warmth**

Two figures—one curled under blankets, one hunched on a chair—waited out the endless night, their shared heat a memory neither could escape.
