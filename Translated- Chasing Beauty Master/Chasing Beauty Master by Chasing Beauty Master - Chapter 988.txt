Standing beside Guan Yu were two young women who appeared harmless at first glance, yet proved to be the most dangerous figures present.

Old Wolf eyed the delicate-looking girls with suspicion. The tall, striking figure of Qiongsi stirred restless desires within him, though he dared not reveal them under Fang Ding’s watchful gaze. Hefting his spiked club, he pointed at Qiongsi and growled, “So she’s the one who knocked your senior brother flying with a single move?”

Fang Ding nodded. “Exactly. Even if my senior brother and I joined forces, we’d stand no chance against her. Caution is wise here.”

“The hell with caution!” Old Wolf barked impatiently. “We’ve got numbers! You think this little wench can take us all? Don’t worry—I’ll restore your honor tonight!”

The situation grew dire for Guan Yu’s group. Wei Hongwei whispered urgently, “Boss, let’s stall while I rally our Yu Gang. If everyone comes, we can handle them.”

**Chapter 2526: Ruthless Efficiency**

Guan Yu shook his head. “Too late. Trust me—I’ve got a plan.”

With over 150 enemies poised to swarm at Old Wolf’s command, annihilation seemed imminent. Guan Yu stepped forward until barely two meters separated him from Old Wolf, his smile deceptively mild. “Old Wolf, was it? Have you truly considered the consequences of attacking me tonight?”

Enraged by the audacity, Old Wolf swung his massive club without another word. The weapon whistled through the air, aiming to crush Guan Yu’s skull. But with a light tap of his foot, Guan Yu retreated swiftly, evading the strike effortlessly.

Though stripped of his inner energy, Guan Yu’s combat instincts and agility remained. “You’ve forced my hand,” he said coldly, the threat in his voice chilling the air. “Attack me, and I’ll show no mercy.”

Old Wolf halted, glaring suspiciously. “What tricks are you playing, brat? For Fang’s sake, you die tonight!”

Fang Ding urged, “Wolf! Capture him now! After how he humiliated me, won’t you avenge me?”

“Consider it done!” Roaring, Old Wolf brandished his club like a toy despite its hundred-pound weight. Just as he prepared to strike, chaos erupted outside.

“Ambush! They’re hitting us from behind!”

The warehouse doors burst open as Qiongsi’s Freedom Faction allies stormed in. Jiang Fenju, acting with ruthless efficiency, had mobilized reinforcements swiftly from their nearby stronghold.

Elated Yu Gang members cheered—their leader had outmaneuvered the enemy again. Fang Ding’s hope withered, remembering Kang Zi’s warning: “Opposing Guan Yu brings ruin.”

Desperate, Fang Ding shouted, “They’re bluffing! Seize Guan Yu, and the rest will surrender!”

Old Wolf barked orders: “You—distract the tall woman! A-Zai, take two men and subdue Guan Yu!”

But as the mob surged forward, all froze. Three gun barrels now aimed unwaveringly at them—Guan Yu’s Desert Eagle, Xue Jing’s Black Star pistol, and Qiongsi’s convincing replica.

“Move,” Guan Yu drawled, spinning his weapon, “and your skull becomes pulp.”

Qiongsi waved her fake gun menacingly. “Call off your dogs outside, or we paint the walls.”

Old Wolf’s bravado melted into sweat. Fang Ding’s rage turned to dread as Jiang Fenju’s forces secured the exits. When she tried to slip away, Freedom Faction guards blocked her path.

“Let her through!” Old Wolf blustered, swinging his club—only to find Qiongsi’s pistol pressed to his forehead, her speed defying human limits.

“One twitch,” she hissed, “and I redecorate this floor.”

**Chapter 2527: Astronomical Sums**

Old Wolf’s bribes of 1 million—then Fang Ding’s desperate 5 million offer—faltered when Guan Yu fired a warning shot.

“Oops,” Guan Yu smirked, smoke curling from his barrel. “Accidental discharge. Anyone hurt?”

Qiongsi chuckled. “Your head’s worth a fortune. Tempting.”

“You need the cash?” Guan Yu retorted dryly.

As Jiang Fenju’s troops flooded in, Fang Ding’s defiance crumbled. Cornered, she spat venomous glares at Guan Yu while Old Wolf’s allies wavered—no reward outweighed survival.

**Chapter 2528: Child’s Play**

When Old Wolf tried smashing through the blockade, Qiongsi materialized like a phantom, gun cold against his skull.

“Try that again,” she warned, “and we’ll see what color your brains are.”

The warehouse fell silent save for Fang Ding’s ragged breathing. Guan Yu surveyed the cowed mob, authority radiating despite his depleted energy. The game had ended—and once again, he’d rewritten the rules.
