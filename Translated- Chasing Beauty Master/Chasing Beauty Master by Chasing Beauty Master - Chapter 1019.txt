“Probably a fake?” Xue Jing interjected. “Since no real treasure map has surfaced so far, I think the whole treasure story was fabricated by someone. It’s likely pure fiction.”

Guan Yu pondered briefly. “No one can confirm its authenticity yet. Our best approach is to collect samples for lab testing. If we can determine the material and age of that leather fragment, we’ll have clearer answers.”

News of another treasure map’s appearance spread rapidly across City A and eventually the entire nation, even making headlines on local television stations.

After acquiring the map, the Yang family swiftly publicized the news, anticipating throngs of curious bidders at their auction. Such events thrived on crowds—the more attendees, the higher the item’s perceived value.

Tycoons from across China descended upon City A, many drawn by the chance to witness the legendary map firsthand. Overnight, the Yang family’s auction house gained unprecedented fame. Wealthy individuals previously unfamiliar with the Yangs now flocked to their doors—all thanks to the map’s allure.

Some attendees aimed to bid exorbitant sums not for treasure hunting, but purely as collectors. These deep-pocketed enthusiasts saw it as another trophy for their vaults.

The Yangs had professionals examine the map and collect samples for analysis, though results would take twenty-four hours. Fortunately, their auction wasn’t scheduled for three days, allowing time to strategize based on the findings.

As Guan Yu prepared to leave, Yang Conghan mentioned, “Grandfather wants to see you when you’re free. He has something to discuss.”

“I’ll visit the old man this afternoon,” Guan Yu replied before departing with Xue Jing to check on his aunt at the hospital. He hoped her condition had improved since her daughter Qu Meimei’s divorce. Xue Jing planned to introduce Meimei to a potential suitor—a crucial step in shielding her from village gossip. In their community, a divorced woman faced ridicule unless she remarried well, which would instead invite envy.

“We can’t visit empty-handed,” Xue Jing said, directing Guan Yu to pull over. She returned with multiple fruit bags, prompting his complaint: “Why so much? Aren’t these heavy?”

“That’s your job to carry,” she retorted cheerfully. “It’s almost noon—let’s go.”

At the hospital’s private suite—courtesy of Yang Conghan—Meimei greeted them warmly. Her mother’s complexion had visibly improved. “You shouldn’t have brought gifts!” the aunt protested. “I’ve been eating fruits nonstop.”

“How’s your leg progressing?” Guan Yu asked.

“Much better! I can put weight on it now,” she beamed. “The doctor was thrilled.”

“Good, but keep resting it. A full recovery needs months,” he cautioned, glancing around. “Where’s Shuangshuang?”

“Probably preparing for school,” Meimei said, unaware her sister lurked nearby. Moments later, the bathroom door burst open, revealing the bubbly teenager.

“Guan Yu哥哥! I missed you!” Shuangshuang bounded over. “You promised to take me out!”

Trapped, Guan Yu negotiated: “After your sister’s matchmaking lunch, I’ll take you somewhere.” Delighted, Shuangshuang insisted on joining the rendezvous.

**Chapter 2606: Follow Me**

The group headed to Milan Café in the bustling south district. A hostess led them to a third-floor private room where Xue Jing ordered meals. When her phone rang, she announced, “They’re here.”

Soon entered a bespectacled woman and a clean-cut young man. Xue Jing introduced: “This is Xiao Yang and Yin Zhong. Meet Qu Meimei and her sister Shuangshuang.”

Yin Zhong, dressed in a crisp white shirt, shook hands politely. Guan Yu noted his respectful demeanor—no red flags so far.

As menus circulated, Shuangshuang’s antics continued. “I’ll behave!” she promised, eyeing the lavish spread. Xue Jing whispered to Meimei: “Yin Zhong’s family runs a reputable auto shop. He’s hardworking—just ignore the grease stains.”

Blushing, Meimei agreed to meet him. For her, remarrying meant escaping stigma and easing her parents’ burdens. This suitor, leagues above her ex, offered hope.

**Chapter 2607: Doesn’t Seem Like a Bad Egg**

Xue Jing’s urgency stemmed from a reckless promise: if Meimei couldn’t remarry, Guan Yu would “take her in.” Now, securing this match would nullify that vow.

During lunch, Yin Zhong’s thoughtful questions and steady eye contact impressed Guan Yu. The mechanic’s calloused hands hinted at diligence, not sloth. Even Shuangshuang approved: “He’s not bad-looking!”

As desserts arrived, Yin Zhong shared childhood anecdotes, making Meimei laugh—a sound her family hadn’t heard in months. Xue Jing exchanged a triumphant glance with Guan Yu. This gamble might just pay off.
