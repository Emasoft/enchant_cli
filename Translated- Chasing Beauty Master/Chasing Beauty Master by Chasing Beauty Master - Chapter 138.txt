Niu Le, however, with a cigarette dangling from his lips, swaggered over to Guan Yu with a smug expression.

“What were you talking about with that guy earlier?” Guan Yu asked with an amused smile, raising an eyebrow.

“Heh… Did you see how that grandson fawned over me? Offering me cigarettes, lighting it for me! Damn fool actually thought I’d fall for his act. Trying to fish information out of me? Pah!” Niu Le tossed his head arrogantly, puffing out his chest.

Guan Yu chuckled and punched his shoulder. “Stay away from that snake. The more righteous they look on the surface, the filthier their guts. You’d get played like a fiddle if you tried matching wits with him.”

“Hah! You think I’d be scared of him?” Niu Le retorted, glaring indignantly.

After exchanging a few more remarks, filming resumed. The director bustled between Park Xu and Gao Wei, explaining key points of the scene as the trio huddled in discussion.

Minutes later, just as cameras were about to roll, Gao Wei waved at Guan Yu and Niu Le, beckoning them over.

As Guan Yu approached, Park Xu suddenly veered sideways—bottle of soda in hand—as if oblivious to their presence, deliberately colliding with Guan Yu’s shoulder.

Though Guan Yu initially tried to sidestep, Park Xu shifted half a step to block his path. The moment Park Xu moved, Guan Yu anticipated his ploy. Without hesitation, he swiftly stepped behind Park Xu with his right leg and sharply jerked his shoulder forward. With a heavy *thud*, he slammed his full force into Park Xu’s chest.

Caught off guard by the impact, Park Xu staggered backward, tripping over Guan Yu’s outstretched leg. He crashed to the ground like an overturned turtle, the soda bottle upending to drench his face.

Park Xu’s original plan—to provoke Guan Yu by “accidentally” squeezing the drink onto him and escalate the conflict into grounds for dismissal—had spectacularly backfired.

Without sparing a glance at the sodden mess sprawled at his feet, Guan Yu stepped over Park Xu and took his place beside Gao Wei.

To onlookers, the altercation appeared as a mere collision, leaving everyone bewildered at Park Xu’s humiliating pratfall.

“Young Master Park! What happened?” Several crew members rushed over, helping him up.

“Are you blind? We’re filming here! Sabotaging the shoot on purpose, huh?” Park Xu roared, flinging wet hair from his face as he jabbed a finger at Guan Yu.

Guan Yu shrugged coolly. “You bumped into me and fell. How’s that my fault? Watch where you’re going.”

“You—Director! Where’s the director? Fire this bastard right now!” Park Xu bellowed, face purpling with rage.

Before the director could respond, Gao Wei stepped forward like an icy goddess. “You have no authority here, Mr. Park. He’s my personal assistant. Fire him? Then you’ll have to dismiss me too.”

Park Xu gaped at her, stunned.

“M-Miss Gao, this… he’s clearly malicious! The crew has plenty of better candidates. Someone like him really shouldn’t—”

“Do I need your opinion on managing my own affairs?” Gao Wei cut him off frostily. “Focus on your acting. That’s all.”

Panting with fury, Park Xu gave a mirthless laugh, nodded stiffly, then hurled his empty bottle to the ground before storming toward the tents.

“Young Master Park! Wait!” The director scrambled after him, clutching his script.

Gao Wei arched an eyebrow at Guan Yu, mouthing “Troublemaker” with an exasperated eye-roll.

Guan Yu merely shrugged and took the props from her hands, ambling away casually.

After extensive coaxing, a seething Park Xu eventually emerged—dried hair, changed clothes—to resume filming.

By the time two scenes wrapped, the clock neared four.

“Smooth sailing today, despite minor hiccups!” The director clapped cheerfully. “To celebrate, the crew’s treating everyone to Huibin Hotel! Extras can collect payment at accounting.”

The distinction was clear: background actors weren’t invited to the feast.

As equipment was packed into vans, the director approached Guan Yu and Niu Le with hands clasped behind his back.

“You two came through Dean Wang’s recommendation, yes? Thanks for the help, but we’ll manage from here. Best not to neglect your studies.” His dismissal couldn’t be plainer.

**Chapter 339: What’s There to Fear About Clothes?**

Guan Yu snorted indifferently and turned to leave just as Gao Wei emerged from her tent, catching his retreating figure.

“Guan Yu…” She called softly, clicking over in heels.

“Director Feng, allow me to introduce my junior and friend,” she stated coolly, gesturing at Guan Yu.

The director’s smile tightened. His glare at Guan Yu screamed *Why are you still here?*

“Where are you headed? The crew’s having dinner. Join us—I’ll drive.” Gao Wei tilted her head.

“Ah, these students likely have academic obligations. Miss Gao, tomorrow I’ll assign you experienced assistants—”

Gao Wei’s eyes narrowed in comprehension.

“In that case, I also have prior commitments. There’s a charity event in Q City, and Director Xue invited me to discuss his new script. Regarding today’s screen test… Perhaps you should consult my agent.” She spun on her heel, motioning Guan Yu and Niu Le toward her sports car.

“Wait! Miss Gao!” The director panicked, blocking her path. “We had an agreement! Contracts are pending! Our promotions are ready! Without you as lead, we’re ruined!”

Gao Wei regarded him impassively. “This role’s too divergent from my usual style. Perhaps it’s not the right fit.”

“Anything’s negotiable! Your friends can stay as assistants! Whatever you want!” Beads of sweat dotted his forehead. Desperate to keep his star and the film’s financiers happy, he groveled before Guan Yu. “Young friends, please stay! I’ll clear things with Dean Wang! You *must* join tonight’s banquet!”

After five minutes of frantic persuasion, Guan Yu relented. The director practically shoved them into Gao Wei’s car, wiping his brow as they drove off.

*Once I’m a top director,* he seethed inwardly, *these arrogant stars will beg me for roles. I’ll make them all pay.*

**Chapter 340: What’s It to Me?**

At Huibin Hotel’s banquet hall, Guan Yu and Niu Le sat at an isolated table while Gao Wei held court at the main seat.

“Let’s eat and leave,” Guan Yu muttered, ignoring the crew members pointedly distancing themselves.

As the director’s pompous speech concluded, elevator doors pinged open. A group of sharply suited men entered, led by a bullish figure.

“Boss Xu! What an honor!” The director fawned, rushing to greet the hotel magnate.

Guan Yu observed idly as Xu Dalong began aggressively pressuring Gao Wei to drink. When she declined, tensions flared until Park Xu intervened with smarmy diplomacy.

“That’s Xu Dalong—hotel owner and our sponsor,” a crew member whispered. “Came for the starlets.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened as Xu slammed his glass, demanding Gao Wei’s compliance. Park Xu preened after defusing the situation, casting a triumphant smirk Guan Yu’s way.

Their eyes locked—Park Xu’s dripping with mockery, Guan Yu’s simmering with disdain.

The unspoken war had just escalated.
