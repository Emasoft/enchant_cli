“Hahaha, as I said, how could the Móhúnzōng (Demon Soul Sect) be so weak? You must have elaborate plans. Hearing your words, I now realize how far the Guàiyāo Cave (Monster Demon Cave) still lags behind your sect.” Xī Liǔ nodded approvingly.

To say Xī Liǔ truly believed this was impossible. She merely wished to avoid an outright conflict with the Móhúnzōng to preserve her own forces.

Coincidentally, the Left Envoy also had no desire to fight the Guàiyāo Cave. He feared the arrival of the Yúnqīng Sect, which would complicate matters further. If that wretched Xī Liǔ allied with them, the situation would spiral beyond control.

“Good that you understand. If the Guàiyāo Cave knows when to retreat, I can pretend today’s events never happened,” the Left Envoy seized the opportunity.

At that moment, another figure approached from afar. Fortunately, Guān Yǔ spotted them and pressed Wáng Xiǎo Róng to the ground, avoiding detection.

The newcomer was Xī Táohuā, the other half of the Yāo Wáng Sisters. Though Guān Yǔ hadn’t met her before, her attire confirmed she belonged to the Guàiyāo Cave.

Having returned from scouting the perimeter, Xī Táohuā interjected, “You’re mistaken, Azure Dragon Left Envoy. Though our Guàiyāo Cave may lack your sect’s strength, we won’t cower. At worst, it’ll be mutual destruction. Eradicating us won’t come easily to your Móhúnzōng.”

With Xī Liǔ already troublesome and his own distaste for diplomacy, the Left Envoy grimaced. Xī Táohuā advanced, continuing, “Perhaps your Demon Lord covets our cave, but that’s irrelevant now. Let’s speak plainly—if you seek battle, we’ll oblige. But if wise, you’ll join us against the righteous sects first. As for retreat? Impossible. We’ve planned this operation for months. Our second wave arrives soon.”

She tilted her head mockingly. “We dispatch messengers every half-hour—a precaution your sect lacks, since we eliminated your couriers en route.”

The Left Envoy’s expression darkened. Their missing messengers confirmed her claims. Unbeknownst to him, Guān Yǔ recognized Xī Táohuā’s bluff—no messengers had crossed their path.

Wáng Xiǎo Róng stirred, eager to expose the deception. Guān Yǔ clamped a hand over her mouth, whispering urgently, “Stay still! If discovered, we’re dead. This isn’t a game!”

Though headstrong, Wáng Xiǎo Róng heeded him, nodding understandingly.

Xī Táohuā’s tone rankled the Left Envoy. “Yāo Wáng Sisters—silent for years, yet secretly scheming. Only through constant surveillance could you know of the Eight-Drum Technique.”

“Correct,” Xī Táohuā admitted freely. “We’ve monitored your sect since you began probing Duōbǎo Mountain over a year ago. That ‘chance’ encounter at Echoing Moon Tower? Our deliberate ploy to appear harmless.”

“Why reveal yourselves then?” the Left Envoy frowned.

“To lull your vigilance. By appearing as mere merchants, you deemed us unworthy of attention.”

The Left Envoy nodded grudgingly. The ruse had worked—he’d dismissed them as nonthreatening, sparing immediate action.

“Why disdain it?” Wáng Xiǎo Róng said, nibbling the coarse bun. “Food shouldn’t be wasted. Thrift begins with oneself.”

Her words hid painful memories. As a child, during her father’s flight from assassins, they’d tumbled into a cavernous pit. For days, they starved until the Demon Lord surrendered his last morsel—a bun she devoured like ambrosia. When dehydration threatened, he slit his wrist to feed her his blood.

Though now privileged, she hoarded no crumb. The others marveled as she relished Guān Yǔ’s stale provisions.

“You must be famished,” Guān Yǔ observed softly.

“Not particularly,” she replied between bites. “But full stomachs fuel action.”

Chuckling at her earnestness, he offered, “Eat your fill then.”

“I’ll grow fat!” she protested, just as distant clashing echoed.

“We need to withdraw further,” Guān Yǔ decided. After repositioning their group, he instructed, “Stay hidden. I’ll scout the battle.”

Wáng Xiǎo Róng trailed him instinctively. “Must you follow?” he sighed.

“Yes,” she nodded vigorously. “It’s dreary waiting.”

“Then no recklessness,” he warned. She bobbed obediently.

The battlefield revealed scattered combatants from both factions. Xī Liǔ and Xī Táohuā faced the Left Envoy and Steward Sūn. Outmatched, the sisters bore injuries while their opponent remained unscathed.

“Left Envoy!” Xī Liǔ cried, gesturing at their fallen comrades. “Must this slaughter continue?”

“Silence!” he roared, retreating to channel spellcraft through his glowing artifact.

As Steward Sūn engaged the sisters, the Left Envoy prepared a devastating incantation. Xī Liǔ bluffed desperately, “Kill us, and you aid the Yúnqīng Sect! Their forces approach even now!”

A white-furred adviser whispered urgently, “We risk being trapped between enemies.”

Grimacing, the Left Envoy relented. “Swear allegiance, and we’ll unite against the righteous.”

At Xī Liǔ’s ceasefire command, both sides disengaged. Guān Yǔ frowned—this alliance complicated his plans.

**Chapter 3544: Peculiar**

The truce left Móhúnzōng with a dozen battered fighters. The Guàiyāo Cave fared worse—two dead, many wounded.

“Was this outcome satisfactory?” Xī Liǔ panted. “The Yúnqīng Sect enters freely through Qín Clan ties. United, we might still claim the Eight-Drum Technique first.”

“Your proof?” the Left Envoy demanded.

“Would I jest now?” she countered. “Mènghuà Patriarch’s underground palace lies across this lake. The center holds our prize—but the waters harbor an ancient guardian turned vicious.”

Xī Táohuā scoffed, “A beast aiding us? Preposterous!”

“That ‘beast’ is a millennia-old turtle,” the Left Envoy explained. “Mènghuà Patriarch befriended it through combat. It alone can ferry us.”

“Then let’s fly across,” Xī Liǔ proposed.

“Attempt that, and it’ll attack. Unless you fancy battling an immortal tortoise...”

“I’ll test this myself,” Xī Liǔ declared, hunger for triumph overriding caution.
