At the forefront, Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu were in the most wretched state. Their limbs had been severed, and their bodies were drenched in blood.

Guan Yu spotted Young Master Feng appearing on the third floor and coldly declared, “Young Master Feng, standing so high above—is this how you receive guests?”

“Guan Yu, spare me the pointless formalities. You’re no guest of mine, nor do I wish to entertain you. What brings you here in the dead of night with so many men?” Young Master Feng asked nervously.

“What do you *think* brings me here? Surely you recognize these two?” Guan Yu pointed at the pair at the front.

Young Master Feng seethed inwardly. Though he’d only played a minor role in the recent events, Guan Yu had still tracked him down. Admitting anything now was out of the question. He knew Guan Yu’s greatest taboo was threats to his family, and he couldn’t afford to be linked to Ge Yinglai and his ilk.

“I recognize them, but what of it? Their dealings have nothing to do with me,” Young Master Feng retorted defensively.

“Nothing to do with you? Bullshit! I’m here tonight to settle accounts. Must I dig up proof for you?” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy, sending chills down Young Master Feng’s spine despite the distance between them.

“Our feud aside, you can’t blame me for everything! I had no part in this. Resolve it yourselves,” Young Master Feng insisted.

“The street outside my home runs red with blood. Nearly a hundred of my brothers lie wounded. You think a denial absolves you? I’m tired tonight. Compensate me for the losses, and I’ll leave at once.”

“I’ve said I’m uninvolved. Why would I lie? Tonight’s folly was their own doing—my Feng family bears no responsibility. Demand repayment from *them*.”

As Young Master Feng kept deflecting, Guan Yu stepped forward and kicked Sun Xu to the ground. “Tell me—who masterminded this? Was the Feng family involved?”

Sun Xu, already missing a hand and foot, trembled in agony. After Guan Yu’s kick, he lacked the strength to rise. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, “Young Master Feng! You can’t abandon us now! We agreed to collaborate against Guan Yu! How can you deny it? Should we bear this disaster alone?”

“Sun Xu! Don’t slander me! The Fengs never conspired with you!” Young Master Feng roared.

“Slander my ass! You think yourself so righteous? We swore to take down Guan Yu together, yet now you wash your hands? Have you no humanity?” Sun Xu thought desperately that implicating Young Master Feng might yet save his life.

Guan Yu pressed, “Well, Young Master Feng? Any last words?”

“Of course! Their lies prove nothing! You think random accusations can smear my family?” Young Master Feng sneered arrogantly.

“Calling you a beast flatters you. Very well—I’ll provide evidence.” Guan Yu turned to his men. “Sever one hand from each of them!”

Before the words faded, the Freedom Faction members acted. Blades flashed, and hands fell. Those who tried to flee lost feet instead.

Guan Yu showed no mercy—crippling them ensured they’d never threaten him again. Leaving them alive was charity.

The night erupted with harrowing screams. Blood geysered, painting the Feng estate’s courtyard crimson.

From his third-floor window, Young Master Feng paled, legs buckling until bodyguards caught him.

“Young Master Feng! Luo Bo serves your family, does he not?” Guan Yu’s roar drowned the moans below. “That Bill family expert tried assassinating me tonight! Still claim innocence?”

Young Master Feng froze. Luo Bo’s mission was to protect Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu—not attack Guan Yu. Yet if Guan Yu knew Luo Bo’s identity… He cursed the two fools inwardly.

With the plot exposed, denial was futile. Everyone knew the Bills and Fengs were allies—Luo Bo’s actions implicated them all.

Steadying himself against the grisly scene, Young Master Feng demanded, “What do you want?”

“I’m weary of conflict. My men need treatment. Hand over fifty million tonight, or your household won’t sleep peacefully.”

The sum made Young Master Feng’s head spin. He’d hoped to placate Guan Yu with a smaller amount. “Fifty million? At this hour? Tomorrow, perhaps? Such greed will choke you!”

“My appetite’s my concern. Fetch the money tonight—I won’t wait.”

**Chapter 2662: Making It Clear**

Though aware of Guan Yu’s ruthlessness, Young Master Feng hadn’t expected such brazen extortion. The maimed figures below didn’t move him—only the spectacle terrified him.

Of the hundreds Guan Yu had captured, only seventy-odd remained. The rest had fled despite Sun Xu’s pleas.

Seeing Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu’s misery, Young Master Feng shuddered. Would this fate someday be his? Elder Feng Xihu’s warning echoed: *“Those opposing Guan Yu meet wretched ends. He’s not human.”*

Now he understood—yet why was *he* targeted when uninvolved? The injustice rankled.

“The sum’s outrageous! I wasn’t involved—Bill Lin devised this idiocy! Demand payment from *them*!”

Guan Yu snorted. “Calling you a beast insults beasts. The Bills saved your clan from ruin, yet you betray them now?”

“It’s the truth! I couldn’t control Bill Lin’s schemes!”

“Enough! The plot originated here—you’re responsible.”

Young Master Feng knew resistance was futile. With Guan Yu’s hundred-strong force—including elites—refusal meant destruction.

“Even if I agreed, why target me alone? And I can’t produce that sum instantly.”

“The Fengs swim in wealth. I’d bill Bill Lin, but he’s absent. You’ll suffice.” Guan Yu’s tone brooked no argument.

“What if I pay part tonight? The rest within a day?”

“Not a cent less. This isn’t bargaining. No money, no mercy.”

*Damn this tyrant!* Young Master Feng seethed silently. With Bill Lin away, confrontation was suicide.

Sighing, he yielded. “Very well. But transferring such amounts takes time.”

“You’ve five minutes.”

**Chapter 2663: Accepting Terms**

After a furious call with Bill Lin—who carelessly dismissed the crisis—Young Master Feng returned to the window. “The money requires account transfers. You’ll have it tonight.”

“Don’t test my patience.”

“Even transfers take time! I don’t keep such sums lying around!”

“Checks or cards suffice.” Guan Yu had anticipated every evasion.

Cursing inwardly, Young Master Feng ordered servants to tend the wounded. Nearly a hundred maimed men were carried into the Feng manor, where household physicians and comely “nurses” attended them.

As Guan Yu’s forces withdrew to rest, Xue Jing whispered, “The Fengs are notoriously stingy. Will he really pay?”

“He’ll pay,” Guan Yu smirked. “Unless he wants his estate reduced to rubble.”

The Feng heir’s character was transparent—fifty million, while substantial, remained within his means. Survival outweighed avarice tonight.
