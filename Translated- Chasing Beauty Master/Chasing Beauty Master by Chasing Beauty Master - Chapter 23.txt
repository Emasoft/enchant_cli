“After taking two steps toward the door, Du Xiaojuan suddenly reached out again, clutching Guan Yu's sleeve with her small hand. Her face scrunched up pitifully, on the verge of tears.

'Fine! Let's go together then!' Guan Yu sighed in resignation, leading Du Xiaojuan as he opened the door.

A striking policewoman with shoulder-length hair stood before them, her delicate oval face radiating both beauty and authority. As Guan Yu observed her, the woman scrutinized him with equal curiosity before striding past into the room.

'Juanjuan! Are you hurt? Who hit you? And who is this?' Though her voice carried musical qualities, the woman's tone turned frosty as she surveyed both Guan Yu and the disheveled bed.

Professional habits. Understandable. Guan Yu arched an eyebrow internally, closing the door before silently returning to sit on the bed's edge.

'What happened? Who made you jump?' demanded Du Wen, clasping her hands behind her back while urgently questioning her niece.

As Guan Yu casually reached for a cigarette, he suddenly noticed the charged atmosphere. Du Xiaojuan gazed at him imploringly while her aunt's fiery eyes bore into him.

Before Guan Yu could explain, the woman abruptly seized his collar. 'Was it you?'

'No... not me,' Guan Yu calmly denied, gently removing her hand.

'Not him? Juanjuan, tell me the truth. I'll deal with this scoundrel... Come here,' Du Wen beckoned, extending her hand.

To everyone's surprise, Du Xiaojuan shrank back, resolutely settling beside Guan Yu. 'Aunt... may I stay with you tonight?'

'Stay with me? But you've always refused before.' Du Wen's eyebrows shot up in surprise, recalling her niece's previous rejections of this very offer.

Guan Yu moistened his lips and began recounting the day's events.

'So Juanjuan's injuries and the jump... were because of you?' Du Wen's glare could have frozen lava.

Guan Yu nodded silently.

'What kind of man hides instead of calling the police?' she exploded, jabbing a finger at his face.

Guan Yu studied her uniform before replying dryly, 'Would reporting help?'

'How dare you question—' The policewoman's voice rose sharply, outraged at this challenge to her profession.

'I genuinely doubt the police could resolve this,' Guan Yu stated evenly, exhaling smoke. His high school experiences with law enforcement had taught him the limitations of reporting gang-related issues without concrete evidence.

Their confrontation escalated until Du Wen finally stormed out with her niece, leaving Guan Yu to his thoughts. The image of Du Xiaojuan's reluctant departure lingered as he wandered back to his lodgings.

Alone in his room, Guan Yu's simmering anger reignited. Those bastards had dared lay hands on someone as delicate as a porcelain doll! His fingers tightened around his phone as he dialed Fu Linlin.

The call revealed Fu's conflicted heart—moments earlier she'd witnessed Guan Yu's heroic catch, stirring long-buried regrets. Their tense meeting later unfolded like a psychological duel, Fu alternating between coquetry and rage as Guan Yu remained impassive.

'Want me? I'm yours if you'll listen to me,' Fu purred, biting her lower lip seductively.

Guan Yu's retort cut like ice: 'If I wanted paid company, the streets overflow with options.'

After their bitter parting, Fu later relented with crucial information. Armed with details about Wang Fubin's hangout, Guan Yu methodically prepared—purchasing and sharpening a watermelon knife with grim determination.

As night fell, the rasp of whetstone against steel echoed through his room, each scrape etching his resolve deeper. The stage was set for reckoning.
