“Holy shit, that looks painful.”

The members of the Yu Gang were murmuring among themselves, while those privy to internal affairs now understood the consequences of crossing Guan Yu's bottom line.

Murderous intent flashed across Guan Yu's face as he slowly approached Xiao Gen. With a sudden punch, he struck Xiao Gen directly in the eye. The mere sight of that gaze filled Guan Yu with visceral disgust.

“Is it fun being someone’s lapdog?” Guan Yu sneered. “Why don’t I end this for you today?”

“I was wrong… I shouldn’t have… opposed you. Please… spare me…” Xiao Gen’s hands, still tied to the tree, were growing numb. Though the initial agony had dulled, the lingering pain still drenched him in cold sweat.

“You know what Sun Xu did. Do you think I’d spare either of you?” Guan Yu’s voice was icy.

“N-no! I only heard about the kidnapping plot against Lan Yu afterward! I had no part in it—it’s nothing to do with me!” Xiao Gen’s face paled with terror.

“Nothing to do with you? You’re his dog. A backstabbing mutt like you is worthless to this world.”

Guan Yu swung his arm in a wide arc, driving another fist into Xiao Gen’s abdomen. Before the man could even cry out, Guan Yu struck his face again.

The brutal blows left Xiao Gen dazed, his consciousness flickering as overwhelming pain consumed him.

Guan Yu lunged forward, yanking the knife embedded in the tree trunk. With a thud, Xiao Gen collapsed. Wiping the blade clean on the man’s clothes, Guan Yu declared, “I’ll spare your wretched life today. If I ever see you again, I won’t hold back.”

Too weak to respond, Xiao Gen lay motionless. Guan Yu straightened and addressed the onlookers: “From this moment, the Junzi Tang is disbanded. Stay out of trouble—or this will be your fate.”

**Chapter 1981: An Unexpected Guest**

Xiao Gen’s mind swam in a haze, every inch of his body screaming with pain that eclipsed all thought.

Guan Yu wrenched the knife from the tree, letting Xiao Gen crumple to the ground. After cleaning the blade, he warned, “Consider this your last mercy. Cross my path again, and you die.”

With Xiao Gen incapacitated, Guan Yu turned to the crowd. “The Junzi Tang ends now. Remember this lesson.”

After kicking Xiao Gen once more, Guan Yu instructed Wei Hongwei: “Dismiss everyone.”

He checked on Lü Mei in the classroom, ensuring Wei Hongwei would guard her, then drove home on his motorcycle.

“Guan Yu, look who’s here!” Xue Jing called excitedly as he entered. Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan stood in the living room beside an unfamiliar middle-aged man.

“Sisters! What brings you here?” Guan Yu’s face lit up.

Du Xiaojuan rushed over, examining his bloodstained clothes. “Are you hurt? What happened?”

These women—once his closest confidantes—still prioritized his well-being above all. They had supported him since his naive youth, their devotion unwavering.

Liu Shilei approached, less visibly alarmed. Knowing Guan Yu’s capabilities, she chided, “Fighting again? When will you outgrow this?”

“They started it,” Guan Yu protested innocently. The room chuckled—they knew he never provoked conflicts needlessly.

Xue Jing nudged him. “Go shower and change.” As Guan Yu passed the stranger, he noted the man’s exceptional physique—a martial artist, though not an esper.

“Who’s this?” Guan Yu asked.

“Oh! Guan Yu hasn’t met you yet.” Xue Jing clung to the man’s arm. “This is my father, Xue Yingfeng!”

*Father-in-law?* Guan Yu mused, bowing politely.

During his shower, he pondered their visit. His sisters had sent him here to shield him from past memories. Their arrival now—coinciding with Xue Jing’s father—suggested deeper concerns.

At dinner, Ah Mei served lavish dishes while enduring Du Xiaojuan’s cheek-pinching adoration. “Such a star reduced to this rascal’s wife!” Du teased.

Blushing, Ah Mei confessed, “I became famous… to find Guan Yu. I’ve loved him since he saved me years ago.”

The table softened. Xue Jing explained Ah Mei’s rural origins and fated encounter with Guan Yu.

Finally, Guan Yu broached the purpose of their visit. “Did Xue Jing tattle about my misdeeds?”

“Your harem’s overflowing,” Liu Shilei joked. “This villa might soon be too small.”

Du Xiaojuan added, “We’re here because Sun Xu’s family has Dragon Group connections. We’re fortifying your defenses.”

Xue Yingfeng interjected, “Sun’s father has powerful allies. I’ll attempt diplomacy first—gifts and reparations. If that fails, we retaliate.”

Guan Yu acquiesced, grateful for their support. Later, he examined Zhang Han’s mysterious internal energy—a dormant force absorbing his probing qi without confrontation.

**Chapter 1982: Gifts**

Xue Yingfeng arrived at Sun Heizi’s office bearing an antique jade qilin. The real estate tycoon’s eyes gleamed at the priceless artifact.

“Old Xue! You shouldn’t have!” Sun Heizi feigned modesty while covetously examining the sculpture.

“A token between friends,” Xue Yingfeng smiled. “Let’s discuss our children’s… misunderstanding.”

As they sipped tea, Xue broached Guan Yu’s conflict with Sun Xu. Sun Heizi’s expression darkened. “Your ‘gift’ won’t erase what that brat did to my son.”

“Accidents happen among youngsters,” Xue countered smoothly. “Surely we can resolve this without involving higher authorities?”

Sun Heizi’s grip tightened on the qilin. “My boy’s in the hospital! No trinket can—”

“Consider carefully,” Xue interrupted. “My daughter’s friends in high places would hate to see this escalate.”

The unspoken threat hung heavy. Sun Heizi’s face twitched—outmaneuvered, but unwilling to concede. The game had just begun.
