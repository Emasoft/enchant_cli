The group of girls still wore expressions of disbelief. In their understanding, something so enormous simply couldn't ascend to the skies, let alone fly at such incredible speeds.

Guanyu realized he couldn't delve deeper into explanations. Concepts like diesel engines would remain incomprehensible to them even if mentioned. "You wouldn't understand even if I explained," he said with a resigned smile, withdrawing his Desert Eagle pistol. "My homeland exists in a realm beyond your imagination—an entirely different world from this one."

He waved the firearm before their eyes. "Doesn't this seem equally miraculous to you?" The gesture reminded them of this treasure that had previously injured the sect leader, requiring months for recovery. Rumors painted it as an unpredictable hidden weapon.

"By your current standards," Guanyu continued, "could you replicate this? Impossible. This device contains complexities far beyond superficial imitation. Yet in my homeland, this counts as an ancient minor invention."

The crowd murmured in reluctant acceptance. If Guanyu claimed a fifty-meter iron block could fly at incredible speeds, perhaps it held truth—their world contained too many unimaginable wonders.

Siqi's eyes sparkled with growing wanderlust. "My homeland differs vastly," Guanyu elaborated, noticing her interest. "Many conveniences exist there—life flows smoother, more humane."

Wang Jun snorted nearby, considering this conversation pointless. Explaining advanced concepts to these girls resembled "playing lute to cattle"—wasted breath that only fueled curiosity without comprehension.

Wang Jun intervened with more relatable topics: "Did you know Guanyu led a powerful gang back home? Equivalent to a sect leader here."

"Truly?" Xiao Lian exclaimed. "He became leader so young?"

Guanyu chuckled wryly. "Through comrades' support. We united against external threats—bullies requiring lessons in humility." His smile faded as memories surfaced—concerns about Yang Family's movements, Yang Conghan's decisions at the bar, Hou Jinshun's loyalty, and Qiongsi's forces guarding Qiaoyuan District.

Most worrying was Zhi Juyu Lang's prolonged absence. If Qiaoyuan faced trouble requiring the wolf-man's extended stay, matters must be dire. While Feng Family dared not act alone against Qiaoyuan's defenses, the Yang Family's sect master—a peak Realm Sovereign—posed genuine threat.

Zhang Han's sealed memories remained the Yangs' coveted treasure, their decade-old secrets potentially devastating if exposed. Guanyu shook his head helplessly—separated by vast distance, he could only await Zhi Juyu Lang's return.

Chapter 4735: Pleading for Aid

As they reached Tiger's Head Peak's safe periphery, Guanyu inquired: "Can we commence wedding chamber festivities now?"

"Traditionally tomorrow night," Wang Jun reminded.

Guanyu's mischievous grin widened. "Where's the fun in waiting? Let's visit the bridal chamber tonight."

"With Siqi present?" Wang Jun arched an eyebrow.

"Your mind dwells in gutters," Guanyu retorted. "I meant sharing wine and conversation. Must you twist intentions?"

"You phrase things ambiguously!" Wang Jun countered. "Had you clarified earlier..."

Their banter continued until reaching the bridal chamber—a refurbished room adorned with mandarin duck lanterns and crimson decor. Inside, Du Bingyan prepared under Siqi and a dozen female disciples' care when knocking interrupted.

Guanyu's liquor-scented entrance with wine jar startled them. "You're drunk!" Siqi chided. "This is improper!"

Chapter 4736: Games Afoot

As discussions turned to Xiao Tong's forbidden romance with mutated Senior Brother Qi, Siqi pleaded: "Help them, Guanyu. You're our only hope."

Guanyu sighed. "Qi chose this path. Without antidote, he'll beastify. Only Demonic Soul Sect possesses cure."

"But Xiao Tong risks expulsion!" Siqi insisted. "For my sake, please!"

Relenting, Guanyu promised: "I'll attempt mediation. But Qi's fate remains uncertain."

When Siqi kissed his cheek in gratitude, Guanyu's smile turned bittersweet. Memories of Xiao Tong's past assistance in latrine incident resurfaced—he owed her discretion. "She'll benefit from your friendship," he conceded, already devising plans involving Wang Jun's antidote stores.

The night deepened with whispered conspiracies and clinking wine cups, wedding preparations continuing beneath surface tensions. Somewhere beyond the festooned chamber, unseen currents of danger and loyalty swirled like autumn leaves caught in conflicting winds.
