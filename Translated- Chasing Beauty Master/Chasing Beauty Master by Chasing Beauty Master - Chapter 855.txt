Almost as soon as it began, it would be over in a count of one-two-three. This predicament tormented Young Master Feng endlessly. As the saying goes, "Like master, like dog." His subordinate had once introduced various instrumental aids to compensate for his inadequacies, forcing him to rely on mechanical devices for amusement.

Leveraging his family's wealth, he summoned renowned physicians worldwide to diagnose his condition, desperately seeking enhancement of his virility. Yet despite prolonged treatments, no improvement manifested.

From that period onward, following medical advice, Young Master Feng religiously consumed aphrodisiac foods—particularly oysters, his daily staple, devouring over half a kilogram each day.

Later, the Feng family paid exorbitantly for a Japanese physician who sold Young Master Feng a miraculous pill. A single dose before intimacy produced dramatic effects, earning the doctor a million-yuan reward.

Yet with time and overuse, the drug's potency waned. What once required three counts now concluded at two, plunging Young Master Feng back into despair. Mechanical aids became his sole recourse.

Today's arrival of a divine ginseng from Clan Leader Ran ignited new hope. For this medication-dependent scion, the root promised resurrection. His heart raced with anticipation.

When Young Master Feng inquired about additional benefits, Clan Leader Ran inwardly cursed his greed. Could this panacea curing all mortal ailments be insufficient?

Suddenly recalling rumors of Feng's proclivities, Ran smirked in understanding. "Young Master, this ginseng cures hundreds of maladies. For healthy men, it enhances vitality and... facilitates secondary development."

"Truly? Magnificent!" Feng nearly leapt with joy. Observing this, Bierlin immediately grasped the implication. Like all men, he coveted this enhancement—a universal masculine aspiration.

Chapter 2207: Collapse

Bierlin resolved not to let Feng monopolize the treasure. Even without aphrodisiac properties, such a rare ginseng must confer health benefits. He'd thwart Feng's selfish scheme.

"On behalf of my father, I thank Clan Leader Ran for this gift," Feng said, eager to conclude matters. "Surely you've other business?"

Indeed, Ran laid bare his crisis: Huayu Group had poached major clients from Ran Steelworks, idling factories and leaving thousand-strong workforce unpaid for two months. Impending lawsuits threatened bankruptcy.

Ran Steelworks' collapse stemmed from Huayu's predatory pricing—operating at break-even through scale and shift incentives. Former ally Lan Family, nearly devoured by Ran years prior, had defected with Huayu's support per Guan Yu's strategy.

Now desperate, Ran sought Bier Family's financial backing through Feng. But Feng deflected: "Our own survival depends on Bierlin's mercy."

Bierlin demurred, citing need for paternal consultation. Secretly, he deemed Ran worthless without reciprocal benefits—unless offering a daughter like Feng Xihu's beauty.

Chapter 2208: Wishful Thinking

After Ran's departure, Feng argued alliance-building value. Bierlin countered: "Surrender the ginseng, and I'll assist."

"Never!" Feng clutched the box protectively. "You spout nonsense," Bierlin scoffed.

As Feng turned to leave, Bierlin blocked him. "Remember our aid to Feng Family. Shouldn't you reciprocate?" His gaze fixed on the ginseng box.

"You'd rob my heart's desire?" Feng protested.

"Precisely." Bierlin's smile turned venomous. "Displease me, and I depart tomorrow."

Calling the bluff, Feng departed defiantly. Undeterred, Bierlin approached Patriarch Feng, spinning tales of congenital liver ailment requiring the ginseng's cure.

Chapter 2209: Half-Lifetime Fortune

Patriarch Feng, initially sympathetic, reconsidered upon learning the ginseng's potency. "Bring it here," he commanded.

The frost-emitting root's appearance confirmed its legendary status—a mobile spirit herb from glacial realms, larger than any recorded specimen.

When Feng returned empty-handed, Patriarch's suspicion flared. "I... intended to consume it for... enhancement," the son admitted.

Patriarch's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. Perhaps this treasure could reignite more than just his heir's vigor...
