“Hmph, you’re lying to me!” Amy finally reacted, pouting her lips and glaring at Guan Yu angrily.

“What lie? How could I ever deceive the most noble Princess Amy?”

“You’re just sweet-talking! Didn’t you tell me before that you were from the Dragon Clan?”

Only then did Guan Yu realize that his earlier words had been taken seriously by Amy alone. She had always firmly believed he was a dragon, hence her daily habit of calling him “Dragon Clan brother.” Now, he’d essentially exposed his own secret.

Yet Guan Yu remained calm. After all, Amy would eventually learn the truth. He pulled her close, stroking her silky hair. “No matter my race, it changes nothing for you. For your sake, I can become the Dragon Clan brother you’ve always wanted!”

Though Amy didn’t fully grasp his words, the affection and promise in his gaze were enough.

“Then I’ll keep calling you Dragon Clan brother!”

“Call me whatever you like, as long as it pleases you.”

Watching the pair’s affectionate display, the two old men shifted uncomfortably. Liu Chuntian’s heart ached with conflicting emotions—she suddenly wished she could trade places with the naive elven princess to receive Guan Yu’s attention.

Finally, Bikar Cat leapt onto Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Boss, let’s rein it in. We’ve got an audience.”

“Ahem. Very well. Next, we prepare to evacuate Barren Town!”

“What? Evacuate Barren Town?”

Guan Yu’s declaration stunned Liu Yishou and the innkeeper.

“Why the shock? Should we wait here to die?”

“But earlier you advised against rash movements!”

“Circumstances have changed. I can’t explain fully, but my instincts warn that staying here risks our lives before nightfall!”

“Hahaha! How self-aware!”

A mocking laugh cut through the tension. Everyone turned to see the source—Lang Duhua (Wolfbane Flower), still bound on the floor.

“Laugh again, and I’ll gag your mouth with stone, you witch,” the innkeeper growled. His hatred for werewolves ran deep—their presence had ruined his business and left him unmarried at fifty.

“Stop!” Guan Yu intervened as the innkeeper moved to kick her. Though sharing no love for werewolves, he refused to condone torturing a bound prisoner.

Lang Duhua showed no gratitude, convinced Guan Yu feared her War Wolf Mercenary Group.

Suddenly, Guan Yu crouched before her. “Did you hear what I said earlier?”

She glared. “What if I did?”

Guan Yu played along coldly. “If you heard, you’ve outlived your usefulness.”

“You’d dare kill me?”

“I captured you, didn’t I? Since we’re already enemies with the War Wolves, why not enjoy the feud?”

“And risk your companions’ lives?”

“I fear for them, but I loathe your kind more.”

Lang Duhua seethed. “You—”

“Bikar Cat, guard her. Any mischief, stuff her back into the spatial ring. She seems to enjoy it there.”

“Yes, Boss!” Their flawless banter reached new heights of shamelessness.

“Hehe!” Amy giggled despite herself, though unaware how deeply this werewolf crisis involved her.

“Curse you all! I’ll haunt you in death!”

“Death? Too kind. I want you suffering—unless you divulge your mercenary group’s structure and capabilities. Cooperate, and I might grant a quick end.”

Humiliated, Lang Duhua’s eyes welled before she burst into tears. “Waaah! You’re all monsters!”

Her sobbing flustered Guan Yu and Bikar Cat. The former struggled most—hardened foes he could handle, but a weeping woman?

“Stop that wailing! It’s grating.”

“I’ll cry if I want!” Her petulant tone blurred Guan Yu’s perception—was this the same vicious killer?

As he hesitated, Amy stepped forward. “Dragon Clan brother, let me handle this.”

Before Guan Yu could object, Amy knelt beside the captive.

“Sister Wolf, why are you crying?”

Lang Duhua looked up into angelic features. Ready to snarl, she faltered before Amy’s clear gaze. “None of your business!”

Guan Yu blinked. Though rebuffed, Amy’s approach calmed the wolf girl more than his threats. Perhaps the princess had unexpected talents.

“True, but I’m nosy! If you’re upset, tell me. I’ll help!”

“Really?” Lang Duhua sniffed.

Amy thumped her chest. “I never lie! Unlike some people.” She side-eyed Guan Yu pointedly.

He averted his gaze, amused rather than offended.

As the conversation veered into comparisons of beauty, Guan Yu nearly intervened—until Amy signaled him to leave.

“Dragon Clan brother, Sister Chuntian, Grandpa Liu—please wait outside. I need to speak privately with Sister Wolf.”

“Must we all go? What secrets require this?”

Amy insisted, and Guan Yu relented. “We’ll wait below. Be careful.”

Liu Yishou fretted. “Girl, don’t trust her! Werewolves are heartless. Shout if there’s danger!”

“I will. Thank you, Grandpa.” Amy turned to Guan Yu. “Trust me this time. I’ll prove myself useful!”

He nodded. “We’ll be downstairs.”

Once alone, Amy addressed Lang Duhua. “They’re gone. Speak freely.”

“Why assume I have secrets?”

“Just a guess.” Amy’s innocent smile disarmed.

“Foolish girl! Aren’t you afraid I’ll break free and kill you?”

Amy’s pulse quickened, but she feigned calm. “Terrified! But you won’t.”

“Why not?”

“Kill me, and you die too.”

Lang Duhua grimaced—the truth stung. “Cleverer than you look, little one.”

“I’m 150 years old! Naivety doesn’t mean stupidity.”

The wolf girl chuckled despite herself. “Sharp tongue. I... don’t dislike you. Let’s trade secrets.”

“How did you become a werewolf?”

“Why ask?”

“Just curious! Let’s exchange—I’ll share mine too!”

“Your secrets? I want Guan Yu’s.”

Amy hesitated. “He keeps much from even me. But I’ll try.”

“How to trust you?”

“I’ll swear an elven oath!”

“You’re an elf?” Lang Duhua’s eyes narrowed, then softened. “No need. I distrust humans, but elves... proceed.”

“Dragon Clan brother is Magister-tier. Your turn.”

“A Magister?!” Genuine shock crossed Lang Duhua’s face—the young man’s power dwarfed her expectations.

“Now you,” Amy pressed.

The wolf girl smirked. “Two more secrets—yours and the cat’s—for three answers from me.”

Amy, against logic, agreed. “Bikar Cat’s no ordinary magical beast. It speaks and wields lightning. Like Guan Yu, it’s Magister-tier.”

Lang Duhua interrupted, “Why trust me so?”

“I prefer simplicity over suspicion.”

The words struck deeper than Amy knew. After a pause, Lang Duhua yielded. “Ask.”

“First: War Wolf Mercenary Group’s hierarchy. Second: Your motive attacking Barren Town. Third: Your true name.”

The wolf girl hesitated, then began...
