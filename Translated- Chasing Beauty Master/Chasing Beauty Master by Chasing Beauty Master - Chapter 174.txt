Lin Lin gave Guan Yu a thumbs-up and praised, “Regardless, this is the first time I’ve seen the great beauty Li treat a guy like this. You’ve got hope! Keep it up, don’t let that Wang Jie inside outshine you. Sis here can’t stand him either.”

Guan Yu was slightly surprised, suddenly realizing that this Lin Lin before him was truly genuine in her temperament.

“Sis, are you still single?” Guan Yu blurted out the question almost unwittingly.

“Oh? Not satisfied with having the great beauty Li already? Now you’re setting your sights on your elder sister?” Lin Lin teased.

Guan Yu was left speechless. He’d only mentioned it casually—where had this woman’s mind wandered? He hadn’t even entertained thoughts about Li Xi yet.

At that moment, they arrived at the door of the private room.

Li Xi gently pushed the door open and stepped inside. The previously lively atmosphere immediately quieted as everyone turned to look at her.

“Our campus belle has finally arrived! Long time no see, still as stunning as ever,” remarked one suave man playfully.

“Chen Ming, long time no see,” Li Xi nodded slightly, her tone cool.

“Nothing’s changed—still as aloof and captivating as always,” another man chimed in.

Li Xi didn’t respond. She found a seat and sat down, murmuring softly, “Apologies for being late. Please continue.”

“Since you’re late, you’ll have to punish yourself with three drinks! It’s been five years since we old classmates last met. Surely the great beauty Li can humor us?” a woman with an air of mature charm laughed.

“Right, right! She must be punished!” Chen Ming egged on.

“Don’t bully Li Xi like this. I’ll drink this cup for her,” said a man even more refined than the previous ones. He stepped forward, gazing warmly at Li Xi.

“Since Young Master Wang has spoken, we’ll allow it!” The room buzzed with renewed energy.

Li Xi glanced at him indifferently. “Unnecessary.”

With that, she picked up her wine glass and downed three consecutive cups. A faint, alluring blush bloomed across her exquisite face.

Wang Jie smiled faintly, unperturbed, as if accustomed to Li Xi’s demeanor. Then he retrieved a small square box from his pocket, knelt on one knee, cradled the box in both hands, and opened it slowly. Locking eyes with Li Xi, he declared tenderly, “Li Xi, please be my girlfriend.”

**Chapter 429: The Fake**

The room fell silent.

Everyone knew this reunion had been orchestrated by Wang Jie for this very purpose, though none had voiced it openly.

While many harbored lingering affections for Li Xi, their family backgrounds paled against Wang Jie’s, relegating them to mere green leaves衬托鲜花.

Though aware of Wang Jie’s intentions, none had anticipated what he might present to win Li Xi over. All eyes now fixated on the item in his hands.

Upon recognizing it, Chen Ming gasped, “Is that… the Heart of the Ocean blue diamond auctioned in Geneva nine years ago?”

The exclamation drew collective awe. They’d all heard of the Heart of the Ocean—a seven-carat diamond ring, flawless and priceless, once sold for around $9 million. Given its artistic value, its current worth surely far exceeded that.

None had imagined this legendary ring now rested in Wang Jie’s possession. The man truly spared no expense.

Wang Jie basked in their admiration, gratified his efforts to gather them here hadn’t been in vain. Acquiring the ring had been arduous, but this moment justified it all.

Li Xi, however, remained unmoved. Like Lin Lin, she’d always disliked Wang Jie. Just as she prepared to reject him, a mocking voice rang from the doorway: “That ring’s a fake.”

All turned to see a stranger leaning against the doorframe, a cigarette dangling from his lips. Beside him stood Lin Lin, their classmate and owner of the club.

Having lingered behind Li Xi, the pair had witnessed Wang Jie’s proposal upon entering. As the crowd marveled at the Heart of the Ocean, Guan Yu—driven by curiosity—activated his scanning system. The results nearly made him burst into laughter: the system identified it as a high-grade replica with 98% purity replication.

Lin Lin stared at Guan Yu, momentarily stunned, then adopted a mischievous grin. “Little brother, care to explain? That’s the Heart of the Ocean worth sixty to seventy million!”

Guan Yu stumbled. She’d promised not to call him “little brother”! Still, he answered earnestly, “The counterfeiter was a master. At 98% replication, standard tests wouldn’t detect it.”

Before Lin Lin could respond, Wang Jie rose furiously, glaring at Guan Yu. “I acquired this ring through private channels from its original collector for eighty million! You dare call it fake? Who are you? Leave—you’re unwelcome here!”

Wang Jie’s rage was palpable. With his grand gesture nearly complete, this interloper’s sabotage was intolerable.

The crowd gasped at the eighty-million figure, far exceeding their wildest estimates. Even as Harvard graduates, most earned annual salaries in the millions—eighty million seemed astronomical.

Lin Lin feigned anguish. “Eighty million! What a waste for Young Master Wang to squander on a fake. Imagine what I could’ve achieved with that sum!”

Her theatrics stung Wang Jie deeper. Their university-era animosity flared anew, though he forced a smile. “Lin Lin, why trust this boy? Multiple experts authenticated this ring. If he’s your guest, I’ll overlook his remarks—but he must leave.”

“He’s not my guest,” Lin Lin replied, eyes glinting.

“Then who brought him?” Wang Jie frowned.

“I did,” Li Xi stated calmly. “If you object, we’ll both leave.”

The room froze. Their ice-cold goddess showing such favor to a young man?

Wang Jie’s face darkened. Now he understood—this was sabotage. Suppressing fury, he addressed Li Xi strainedly, “Even if he’s your friend, he can’t slander me freely.”

Having remained silent, Guan Yu finally stubbed out his cigarette. “Have your ring inspected by precision instruments. Or I’ll gladly prove it here.”

A scan of Wang Jie’s mind revealed the man had indeed paid eighty million—though how it became a fake en route remained unclear.

Wang Jie sneered. Confident in his purchase, he handed over the ring, banking on public scrutiny to expose Guan Yu’s fraud. Yet halfway through, he hesitated—what if Guan Yu damaged or discarded it?

Noticing his wavering, Guan Yu mocked, “Just admit you’re scared. Such pettiness.”

“How did you—?!” Wang Jie blurted, shocked Guan Yu had guessed his exact fears.

“Idiot,” Guan Yu spat before turning to Lin Lin. “Sis, are you sure this fool graduated Harvard? At his IQ, he’d struggle even in our local schools.”

Lin Lin burst into laughter, scrutinizing Wang Jie mock-seriously. “Now that you mention it, he does resemble our classmate Wang Jie… somewhat.”

Wang Jie’s eye twitched. The duo’s act had trapped him into losing face. Struggling to maintain decorum, he pivoted: “If you can authenticate this, show us your equipment!”

“Equipment? What equipment?” Guan Yu blinked.

Wang Jie reddened. “No equipment? You expect to authenticate a diamond by sight? Lin Lin, see how he mocks us?”

Guan Yu retorted, “You won’t hand it over, yet claim I can’t prove it’s fake?”

Realizing further debate was futile, Wang Jie turned to Chen Ming. “We’ve forgotten our true expert here. Chen Ming’s family are jewel appraisal authorities. Let him judge.”

Lin Lin tensed. Chen Ming’s pedigree was undeniable—his grandfather a renowned appraiser, himself a prodigy authenticated global treasures.

Wang Jie smiled victoriously. “Chen Ming, why stay silent? Let’s end this farce.”

Chen Ming shrugged. “You never gave me a chance to speak earlier. But yes, I’ll examine it.”

**Chapter 430: Some Resemblance**

As Chen Ming stepped forward, Wang Jie added pointedly, “Let’s expose this charlatan’s antics.”

Li Xi frowned at the jab, while Lin Lin snapped, “Wang Jie! Apologize to my brother!”

“If the ring’s fake, I’ll apologize,” Wang Jie countered. “But if he’s wrong, he must kneel and beg forgiveness.”
