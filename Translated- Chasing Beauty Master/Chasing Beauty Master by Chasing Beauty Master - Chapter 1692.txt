Guan Yu knew that Chief Dai held an irreplaceable position in Siqi's heart, like the only respected elder she had in this world.

Just as Guan Yu himself had elders he revered in the Yunqing Sect, though Xuan Ming couldn't count among them—the man was far too petty, earning Guan Yu's frequent disdain.

However, Chief Lu had always held high esteem in Guan Yu's eyes, as did Elder Jiu, both commanding his deep respect.

An amusing question suddenly occurred to Guan Yu. Sitting beside Siqi on the bed with his arm around her, he asked, “Can I ask you something?”

Siqi, fiddling with the jade ruyi in her hands, replied without looking up, “Of course. Go ahead.”

“I know Chief Dai means the world to you,” Guan Yu began, “but if one day, both he and I fell into a river and were drowning, who would you save first?”

The question froze Siqi. After a long pause, she groaned, “What kind of question is that? It’s impossible! I’d want to save both!”

“But you can only save one,” Guan Yu pressed, amused. “One is the person you love, the other your most revered elder. How would you choose?”

“I… I can’t choose! I can’t even swim!” She laughed nervously. “I wouldn’t dare jump in—I’d drown too! There, happy? I’d save neither!”

Siqi knew this was a trap. Saving either would betray the other, so claiming neutrality eased her conscience.

“You can’t swim? Then Chief Dai and I are doomed!” Guan Yu feigned exasperation. “But if you *had* to save one—who?”

“Must you torment me?” Siqi sighed. “If I can’t save both or neither… I’d rather be the one drowning!”

**Chapter 4425: Long Since Noticed**

“Picture this,” Guan Yu continued, grinning. “I’m thrashing and screaming for help. Chief Dai’s shouting too. Who on shore would you save first?”

A sly person might flatter whoever asked, but Siqi rarely lied—especially to Guan Yu—hence her struggle.

“I’d save you,” she finally said, voice steady. “Though your question pains me… If that day came, my debt to Master is gratitude, but you—you’re love. I’d choose love.”

She added softly, “But I’d carry guilt forever. Master raised me. That kindness… I could never repay it.”

“Don’t dwell on it.” Guan Yu tousled her hair. “I’m a strong swimmer—this was just a joke. Never mind!”

Changing the subject, he gestured to the ruyi. “Did Chief Dai help bind this to you?”

“Yes. He purified lingering demonic energy from it. He said to maximize such a rare high-grade artifact, joint ownership was necessary.”

“After binding, it feels… different. More responsive.”

“Master says every Yunqing disciple would envy this,” Siqi beamed. “Even her own artifacts pale in comparison.”

“Naturally!” Guan Yu agreed. “This ruyi’s a high-grade relic, likely forged in the demon realm. You’ve barely scratched its power. With time, you’ll unlock more.”

“Yunqing disciples are the poorest cultivators! Others wield diverse artifacts, while ours all carry Yunqing Swords—pathetic!”

“That’s unfair,” Siqi countered. “Many outsiders covet Yunqing Swords. They’re categorized—Ling Su and Lin Chen’s have larger gemmed hilts, storing more spiritual energy.”

“I noticed,” Guan Yu said. “But ours are still superior. Azhe and Xiaozhi’s are mediocre. The sect’s elders hoard treasures like misers guarding graves!”

**Chapter 4427: Entrusted to You**

Siqi chuckled. “You misunderstand. Powerful artifacts aren’t merely tools—they’re research subjects. Studying my ruyi could elevate Master’s cultivation. Hence, elders retain them.”

“So Chief Lu’s high rank stems from artifact research?”

“Perhaps. He’s led the chiefs since my childhood. Yunqing Swords *are* envied—Red Lotus Sect disciples often lack proper artifacts.”

“They’re that destitute?” Guan Yu frowned, recalling Yue Jing and Lai Lixia’s decent tools. “Still, Yunqing’s cultivation surpasses others. Our swords must contribute.”

He grudgingly admitted Yunqing’s stature as the top sect was earned—though greater generosity could deter even the Demon Sovereign.

Regarding the Qianlong Sword, Siqi explained, “It only emerges during existential crises or leadership transitions. Seeing it requires unanimous approval from chiefs and three rear-mountain elders.”

“So witnessing it’s rarer than mastering the Four Drums Art!” Guan Yu groaned. “I’ll die before laying eyes on it!”

**Chapter 4428: Sufficient**

As Siqi admired the jade lion Guan Yu gifted, she mused, “This golden flower pairs perfectly with the ruyi. Were they once a set?”

“The lion’s part of a pair—male and female,” Guan Yu said. “Crafted by a master for a prince courting a beauty. The other’s lost.”

“Such a pity,” Siqi sighed.

“The green jade supposedly beautifies and wards off ailments,” Guan Yu added.

“Truly?” Siqi’s eyes lit up at “beautify.”

Noticing her interest, Guan Yu offered, “Keep it. I’ll lose it otherwise.”

After polite refusals, she relented: “I’ll safeguard it until we return.”

“You’re too good to me,” she murmured, nestling against him.

At dawn, Guan Yu visited the sweet potato vendor. Finding the elderly woman asleep, he nearly self-served before she stirred.

“Young man, back so early?”

“Your potatoes are irresistible.” He proffered a silver ingot. “Take this for the entire batch.”

“Too much!” she protested.

“Keep it. I’ll claim freebies next time.”

Touched by her dignity amid poverty, Guan Yu admired her resilience—a soul worth aiding.
