After making adjustments, Master Qi secretly mobilized the Imperial Guards. Earlier in the forest, it was the Imperial Guards who attempted to assassinate Prince Zou, but they failed. Upon returning, they received a severe reprimand from Master Qi. Now, after a full day of preparation and reinforced numbers, they were determined to bring back Prince Zou's head to complete their mission.

Originally believing they had seized the perfect opportunity today, surrounding Prince Zou's entourage from all sides, they were confident of success. Yet unexpectedly, this unforeseen situation had occurred.

Through prior reconnaissance and attrition tactics, Prince Zou's forces had been gradually depleted. Each loss among his retinue was irreplaceable. The soldiers sent by the City Lord's estate were mere cannon fodder in the eyes of the Imperial Guards.

**Chapter 4045: Don’t Listen to His Nonsense**

Eighty against thirty—the odds left no room for escape. Yet the mysterious deaths of several comrades had unsettled the attackers.

The momentum had clearly shifted to chaos. Leading this operation was a centurion of the Imperial Guards, accustomed to commanding over a hundred men. Through years of service, he had never feared any challenge.

When the Imperial Guards acted, abundant manpower ensured high success rates. But today's situation proved troublesome. Surveying the scene, the centurion shouted, “Stay calm! This is mere trickery! Second, Third, and Fourth Divisions—stand ready!”

Guan Yu immediately realized the “divisions” referred to archers positioned in three directions, while the group behind the centurion constituted the First Division.

Though the archers might soon attack, the left flank remained unstable after Wang Jun's intimidation—some stood frozen, others paced anxiously. Only a few maintained steady aim.

Wang Jun, fully prepared at the rear, loosed a crossbow bolt. With a hum, it pierced the neck of a crouching man before embedding itself in the waist of another behind him, felling two in an instant.

Two more deaths in quick succession threw the Imperial Guards into disarray. Their enemies wielded unseen weapons that killed without warning.

Guan Yu called out, “Wise centurion, consider your men’s lives! Persist, and none shall return alive. Let me warn you—whether you flee or fight, decide swiftly. Reinforcements from Ao Tian Manor approach. When they arrive, escape will be impossible!”

“Ignore his lies!” the centurion countered. “The messengers sent to Ao Tian Manor were intercepted. No help comes.”

The centurion glared at Guan Yu, unsettled that his identity and rank were known. These witnesses could not be spared.

“Brothers!” he rallied. “Today’s mission permits no failure! Remember the consequences! With our numbers, Prince Zou’s head is easily taken!”

Guan Yu retorted, “Step forward, and I’ll burst your skulls like melons! Test me if you doubt!”

His words froze the archers mid-draw, fearing retaliation.

Inside the carriage, Prince Zou peered through the curtain, astonished that a single youth cowed so many Imperial Guards led by a centurion—a pitiful commander trembling before one man.

The centurion’s fear was understandable. Witnessing comrades die instantly would unnerve anyone. Surrounded, Prince Zou had despaired until Guan Yu’s audacious bluff reversed the tide.

Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao exchanged bewildered glances. The unseen force slaughtering enemies hinted at hidden allies—perhaps experts recruited by the steward Lao Cang.

The Imperial Guards, accustomed to intimidating others, now tasted their own medicine. Their morale crumbled under inexplicable deaths, leaving the centurion torn between retreat and pressing the attack.

Guan Yu taunted, “A full centurion deployed against Prince Zou? Such effort risks great turmoil!”

Unbeknownst to him, Zou Wuhui had identified their foes by discipline and tactics—hallmarks of Imperial Guards poorly disguised.

**Chapter 4046: Shifting Tides**

Zou Wuhui deduced their adversaries’ identity through coordinated movements and battle-hardened cohesion—traits unique to the Imperial Guards’ long-trained units.

Though masked, their bearing betrayed them. The centurion had anticipated an easy victory: surround thirty men, loose volleys, and depart. Instead, chaos reigned. Even if ordered, archers now feared to shoot, dreading invisible retaliation.

“So you know my rank,” the centurion said. “You must be court-affiliated. We’ve scouted Prince Zou’s retinue—three adopted sons and three captains. Zou Wuyi is dead; Zou Wuhui and Zou Wuxiao remain. The captains guard his left and rear. City Lord’s soldiers are worthless. Yet you—where did you emerge from? I’ve never seen you.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Does my origin matter? I serve His Highness, as do many unseen protectors. Did you think he’d travel vulnerable? Only fools march into danger unprepared. You grasp surface truths—tonight, even if I fall, others will take my place. Your task is far harder than it seems.”

Prince Zou marveled at Guan Yu’s psychological warfare, amplifying the enemy’s unease.

The centurion wavered. If hidden protectors existed, retreat might be wise. Yet he recalled Prince Zou’s past escape through sacrificial diversion and dismissed the threat as bluster.

“Don’t heed these lies!” he shouted. “Their forces are spent! If they had reinforcements, why delay? Show these phantom allies, or my offer stands: flee now or die!”

As he spoke, Guan Yu’s crossbow struck a perimeter guard, silencing him mid-throat. Soldiers instinctively huddled, spines chilled.

“Still doubt?” Guan Yu sneered. “Leave now, or I slaughter you all.”

From the carriage, Prince Zou intoned, “Centurion Gao—must we meet as enemies? I bear your men no malice. You act under orders, but my head won’t be easily claimed. Withdraw.”

Guan Yu stifled laughter—the prince had joined the charade, falsely recognizing the centurion’s surname to unsettle him.

Centurion Gao stiffened. “Your discernment impresses, Prince. But knowing my identity seals your fate. If you live, I die. Tonight ends here.”

“Must we spill blood?” Prince Zou pleaded. “Even if you succeed, half your men will perish. What purpose does this serve?”

“Duty binds me,” Gao replied. “Your pitiful guard poses no threat.”

The prince smirked, silently inviting attack, now trusting Guan Yu’s mysterious prowess.

Guan Yu bargained, “Name your price. Spare your men—His Highness may grant it.”

Ignoring him, Gao roared, “Hear me! Whoever takes the prince’s head earns a hundred gold taels and ten beauties!”

Though avarice flickered, none moved—no one wished to die first.

**Chapter 4047: Blood Price**

Guan Yu seized the hesitation. “His Highness offers mercy. Leave now, and live.”

Prince Zou added, “Centurion Gao, must your loyalty cost so many? I recognize your valor—one of the Guard’s four finest centurions. The others, aged and retired, leave you to this dirty work.”

Gao’s voice chilled. “Flattery won’t save you. How did you know me?”

“Your reputation precedes you,” the prince said. “Only the youngest, most capable centurion would lead this force. The others I’ve met are long past fieldwork.”

“Then I’ll die here rather than face disgrace!” Gao spat.

“Stubbornness serves none,” Prince Zou sighed. “Must we all bleed tonight?”

Gao steeled himself. “Our fates are sealed. Attack!”

But his men hesitated, terrorized by the invisible reaper. Guan Yu pressed, “Go! Before death claims you!”

Suddenly, a crossbow bolt struck a peripheral guard—another silent kill. The soldiers recoiled, cohesion crumbling.

“You see?” Guan Yu jeered. “My blades hunger. Will you feed them?”

The centurion’s authority wavered. Fear had paralyzed his troops. Even promised riches couldn’t stir men who valued breath over gold.

Prince Zou’s carriage curtain fluttered. “Centurion Gao, this path leads only to graves—yours and theirs. Withdraw, and I’ll forget this insult.”

Gao’s resolve fractured. The unseen deaths, the prince’s uncanny knowledge—were hidden protectors real? His hand trembled on his sword hilt.

Guan Yu pressed the advantage. “Choose now—gold for your coffers, or worms for your corpses!”

A long silence followed. Then, with a strangled curse, Centurion Gao signaled retreat. As his men scattered into the night, Prince Zou exhaled—the bluff had held. For now.
