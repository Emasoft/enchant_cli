In truth, Guan Yu wasn't truly angry. As a fellow wanderer far from home, he deeply understood Murphy's helplessness. He promptly reassured, “Don't worry. The old man will hold on just to see you again!”

Murphy's spirits lifted at these words. With a smile, he offered his skewer of roasted meat. “Brother Guan Yu, try mine. How does it taste?”

Though intending to decline, the tantalizing aroma proved irresistible. Guan Yu accepted the steaming snake meat, blowing cautiously as rivulets of saliva pooled in his mouth. When the first morsel finally touched his tongue, crispy skin gave way to succulent flesh – perfectly seasoned, neither greasy nor bland. Despite the scalding heat, he devoured it with gusto.

Delighted by Guan Yu's enjoyment, Murphy immediately carved more meat chunks with his broadsword and resumed roasting. This simple, earnest gesture moved Guan Yu far more than empty flattery ever could.

“Don't just cook for me,” Guan Yu urged, turning his own skewer. “Eat together! Try mine – it's almost done.”

Murphy obligingly sampled the offering, only to freeze mid-chew. Guan Yu's prolonged roasting had charred the exterior into acrid bitterness. The younger man's expression told all – Guan Yu's tentative nibble confirmed the culinary disaster.

Their camaraderie drew envious glances. Harris particularly couldn't resist inserting himself between them. “Young Hero Guan Yu! What's happening here?”

“Nothing,” Guan Yu replied coolly, irritation flashing at the intrusion.

Unfazed, Harris grinned through the awkwardness. “Your meat's ready? Let's swap!” Without waiting for consent, he snatched Guan Yu's burnt offering and thrust his own skewer forward.

Harris's face contorted comically upon biting the charred meat. “How... delightful!” he forced through clenched teeth.

Guan Yu nearly retched at the blatant falsehood. He'd rather endure Murphy's honest disgust than such sycophancy. Abandoning the simpering Harris, he rejoined Murphy elsewhere.

Left clutching the ruined meal, Harris chuckled hollowly at his self-inflicted humiliation.

After the meal, the group settled to rest. Guan Yu chose a high tree branch – both vantage point against beasts and makeshift watchtower. Exhaustion claimed the party swiftly. As drowsiness blurred his thoughts, Guan Yu clung to one clear purpose: reclaim his lost memories and reunite with loved ones.

Dawn found him awake first. He roused the others, unease prickling his senses. “We should hurry. The weather feels ominous.”

Harris initially dismissed the concern – morning gloom hardly warranted alarm to his "scientifically enlightened" mind. Yet under Guan Yu's insistence, the group pressed onward.

The rushing roar of a torrent soon halted their march. Between two mountain ridges surged a river – wide, swift, and treacherous. “Must we cross this?” Guan Yu frowned.

“Beyond lies our destination,” Harris confirmed.

Guan Yu surveyed the group skeptically. Without flight capabilities, spanning hundreds of meters seemed impossible. His doubts vanished as disciples began plunging into the rapids like dumplings into boiling broth.

To his astonishment, the swimmers navigated the current with piscine agility. “Heavens! They could win swimming competitions!” Guan Yu marveled.

“Young Master Guan!” Murphy called from the river's tail, treading water. “The current's refreshing! Won't you join us?”

Guan Yu waved him off. “Go ahead. I'll manage.”

As the group reached mid-river, Guan Yu sprinted backward for momentum. With a mighty leap, he soared skyward, gliding on magic-fueled aerodynamics. Inner energy circulated through his meridians, harmonizing with ambient elements to sustain altitude.

The swimmers gaped as he passed overhead. “How do you fly without wings?” someone shouted.

“It's not flight,” Guan Yu explained, hovering midair. “Magic fields interact with my energy – an invisible force suspending me.”

“Magic fields? What nonsense!” scoffed a swimmer – Griffen, his stroke slightly more polished than others'. “Empty theatrics! You lot are blind fools cowering before cheap tricks!”

The insult hung heavy. Guan Yu's gaze sharpened. “Shut your mouth, cur!” Harris immediately barked. “Apologize, or-”

“Enough.” Guan Yu descended until swirling vortices erupted around Griffen. Whirlpools churned, waves mounting like aquatic dragons. The doubter flailed helplessly in the maelstrom.

“Mercy, Young Master!” Murphy cried, battling currents to reach Griffen. “He's too prideful to admit error – but he knows his mistake!”

Guan Yu elevated, calming the waters. “Why defend him?”

“I... recognize myself in his stubbornness,” Murphy panted, dragging the spluttering man. “We all cling to pride when terrified.”

The words struck deep. Guan Yu soared to the far bank, leaving awestruck stares in his wake.

As the bedraggled group regrouped, Harris offered obsequiously: “Shall we punish the insolent wretch?”

Guan Yu glanced at the shivering Griffen. “Any man can soar,” he said pointedly. “If he dares let go.”
