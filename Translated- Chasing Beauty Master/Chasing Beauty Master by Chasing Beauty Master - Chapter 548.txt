Guan Yu shook his head upon hearing Wolf Tianhua's words. "You're correct. Superficially, he may not seem like your match now. But as elves who understand Locke more profoundly, we consider him a prodigious existence - not only formidable in might but also exceptionally gifted. Do you truly believe such a prideful soul would willingly remain a mere underling in your War Wolf Mercenary Corps?"

Though Guan Yu's words carried harshness, each syllable struck deep. Wolf Tianhua no longer reacted impulsively as before, chuckling instead. "You're cunning, using such divisive tactics. Yet I acknowledge your points. Let me reciprocate - you know Locke doesn't consider us friends, but remain ignorant that we've been using him!"

"What? You've been using Locke?"

"Precisely! With Locke's assistance, we'll penetrate the Forest of Elves with ease. The War Wolf Mercenary Corps shall establish it as our southern stronghold to conquer the entire Blue Beauty Continent! Those elves will become our slaves! As for Locke..." His lips curled contemptuously, "He's but a pawn at best!"

Guan Yu's expression shifted as the gravity crystallized. Neither Locke nor the War Wolf Mercenary Corps were simple entities. Should their plans succeed, mutual betrayal became inevitable. Letting them destroy each other might prove advantageous.

Yet immediate peril loomed over the elves. Fresh from internal strife, their weakened state left defenses crippled. If Locke and the mercenaries struck now, catastrophic consequences awaited the elvenkind.

Chapter 1387: Shattered Strike

"Cough! Don't heed his nonsense!" Guan Yu protested. "We've merely known each other two days! What 'trump card' could I possess?"

"Brother Guanyu, take me for a fool?" Wolf Tianhua's eyes glinted. "Why would this old coot mention a 'trump card' without cause? No wonder you remained composed earlier! Reveal your hidden capabilities - I crave a proper duel!"

Guan Yu shot Liu Yishou a warning glare, silently commanding cessation of these dangerous insinuations.

"Don't mock me," Guan Yu demurred. "I'm but an ordinary youth, having shown all my skills before seniors."

Yet Liu Yishou blundered onward, oblivious. "Young Master Guan, why hesitate? Don't we have an ally?"

"An ally?" Wolf Tianhua's predatory grin widened. "How intriguing! Male or female? Mage or swordsman? Of what rank?"

As Guan Yu's mind conjured images of Bika Cat, suppressed laughter threatened. "It..." he began, voice trembling with mirth.

"Enough prattle!" Liu interjected. "Let's enter and find your companion!"

"Guan Yu!" Wolf Tianhua's claws extended, glinting wickedly. "Control this meddlesome fool, lest I accidentally sever his throat!"

"I've no authority over him," Guan Yu replied evenly. "But should you threaten him, I'll exercise my right to intervene."

"Brave words!" The mercenary leader's muscles rippled, bestial transformation commencing. "This merely strengthens my resolve to eliminate you both!"

As Wolf Tianhua's metamorphosis completed, Guan Yu marveled at the grotesque fusion of man and wolf. What infernal alchemy birthed this abomination?

"Exactly thus!" Liu Yishou quavered, pupils dilating in terror. "This form assaulted me yesterday!"

Guan Yu sighed inwardly at the old man's sudden cowardice, noting his own unease before those azure, inhuman eyes.

"Fear not, old man," the wolfman growled. "My promise stands - no fatalities. But you'll accompany me regardless."

"Brother Tianhua, must we persist thus? I've renounced all ties with the elves!"

"Lies upon lies!" Wolf Tianhua snarled. "Did you think me ignorant of your connection to Princess Amy (艾米)?"

Guan Yu's composure faltered. "Very well. To prevent further misunderstanding - yes, I knew Princess Amy. Our friendship ended when Locke revealed himself as traitor."

Resolved to sabotage the mercenary-locke alliance, Guan Yu prepared desperate measures.

"Do you deem me gullible?" Wolf Tianhua's gaze remained inscrutable.

Unexpected silence reigned until Liu Yishou nudged Guan Yu, whispering, "Young Master, why conceal these matters?"

Guan Yu silenced him with a look.

"Regardless of truth," Wolf Tianhua finally declared, "I'll spare you today in gratitude."

Relief washed over both men, tension momentarily easing.

"Let us part ways then," Guan Yu proposed. "The elves themselves pursue Locke."

"Celebrate prematurely?" The wolfman's claws flexed. "Non-lethality doesn't equate to freedom."

Guan Yu's muscles coiled anew. "What meaning holds this?"

"Orders from above. My mercy has limits."

"Your War Wolf Mercenaries baffle me! Why trust obvious villainy?"

"Because Locke claims you murdered Wei Buqun!"

Guan Yu's spine stiffened. Wei Buqun's death by his hand, though self-defense, would find no sympathy here.

Liu Yishou paled, recognizing the name. "One of Dark Mercenary Alliance's Ten Blades! A true Sword King!"

Guan Yu's mind raced. "My killing Wei Buqun? Locke's fabrication, surely?"

"Does he err?"

"Utterly! Truthfully, Locke himself struck the fatal blow!"

"Take me for imbecile?" Wolf Tianhua's fur bristled. "Locke recounted every detail! Persist in lies, and my restraint may falter!"

Chapter 1388: Avarice

"My words may invite skepticism," Guan Yu pressed, "but hear my account before judgment."

"Speak swiftly. Delay risks finality."

"You ugly monstrosity!" Liu Yishou blurted. "Think us helpless?"

"Old fool!" Wolf Tianhua's maw dripped saliva. "My mercy stems from respect to Guan Yu. Provoke me further, and promises shatter!"

Ignoring the exchange, Guan Yu continued: "Returning from Jinzhou City with Lion Camel, we suffered Wei Buqun's ambush. Puzzled, having never antagonized Blackwater Mercenaries, we later discovered Locke's machinations - inflaming elf-human tensions for personal gain. When Blackwater faltered, Locke eliminated Wei Buqun to avoid reprisal."

Wolf Tianhua absorbed this silently, features impassive.

"Your tale holds logic," he conceded. "Truth becomes murky. Know this - Wei Buqun and I shared no camaraderie beyond Dark Alliance service. Our true aim? The Forest of Elves' riches! Revenge mere pretext."

Guan Yu's eyes widened at the admission. The mercenaries' ambition exceeded all estimation! Locke's knowledge of elven secrets now posed critical danger.

"Silent?" Wolf Tianhua taunted. "Plotting warnings to your elven paramour?"

Guan Yu forced laughter. "First, I'm no elf. Second, mere months' acquaintance. Third, I'll not risk life for strangers."

"Yet rumors persist... particularly regarding the Elven King's daughter."

Guan Yu's pulse quickened. Amy's safety haunted him - King Allen's precious charge, entrusted to his care. Any harm would be unforgivable.

"Forest's life essence attracts me," he dissembled. "Princesses hold no interest."

"Odd, for I hear differently. The Yin Cold Poison afflicting her... fifteen days until demise without antidote?"

Guan Yu feigned ignorance. "Locke's fabrications again?"

"His information proved accurate thus far. Your current quest - seeking cure, perhaps? Where hides the princess now?"

"Absurd! The king's jewel remains guarded, especially in infirmity."

"Earlier denial contradicted. Which is truth?"

"Idle words, disregard them."

"Then shall I dismiss all your prattle?"

Guan Yu shrugged. "As you will. What secrets did Locke reveal?"

"Why inquire? More deception? Know this - Locke warned of your tricks. Vigilance proves warranted!"

"Why persist in distrust? Final warning - Locke's vulpine cunning will destroy you!"

"Fox versus wolf?" Wolf Tianhua sneered. "The cleverest fox becomes prey before the pack!"

"Have your delusions then! My disinterest in elves stands. Seek other pawns!"

"Enough! You'll accompany me. Truth will emerge. Should innocence prevail... perhaps friendship blossoms."

"Friendship?" Guan Yu scoffed. "A decade's wanderings never yielded such 'friends'!"

"Limited worldview. Earlier encounter with us might have... enlightened you."

"Young Master!" Liu Yishou urged. "Why tolerate this? Our strength matches his!"

"Test me, relic!" Wolf Tianhua roared. "Guan Yu's presence alone preserves your breathing! Recall - we've yet to see this vaunted trump card!"

Chapter 1389: Concealment

Wolf Tianhua's momentary trepidation passed. "Secrets yet, Guan Yu?"

The young warrior understood Liu's reference to Bika Cat. Combined with his own abilities, they might overcome the wolfman. But revealing Amy's presence risked catastrophic consequences if reinforcements arrived.

Stalemate gripped them. Though Guan Yu could match Wolf Tianhua, escape with Locke proved impossible. The mercenary's stubborn suspicion compounded frustration.

"Why cower?" Liu Yishou goaded. "Your suppressed strength mystifies! What fears stay your hand?"

Guan Yu seethed inwardly. This blundering ally threatened to unravel everything. Had he foreseen such idiocy, the old man would never have accompanied him.
