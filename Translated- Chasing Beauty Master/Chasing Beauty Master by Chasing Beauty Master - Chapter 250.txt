As he racked his brain trying to find a balance between the two parties, the private room door swung open.

Jia Ren looked up, his worried expression instantly transforming into a smile as he rose. "Brother Xiao, you're here. Please have a seat and enjoy some tea. We're still waiting for one more person."

"Commissioner Jia, I'm deeply honored you'd spare time from your busy schedule to invite me for tea," Xiao Xiong replied, shaking hands with a warmth absent from his earlier interactions with Cheng Gui. After all, both Xiao Xiong and Guan Yu aimed to build rapport with the police chief. With Jia Ren's support, dealing with Cheng Gui would become far easier.

Jia Ren nodded approvingly. As bureau director, he'd already humbled himself by waiting half an hour. Had Xiao Xiong shown disrespect, this meeting would have ended differently.

"Brother Xiao, did you encounter Cheng Gui?" Jia Ren asked pointedly. He hadn't mentioned inviting their mutual rival during their phone call, nor would he deny it now. At this critical juncture, both men understood the purpose of this tea invitation.

"Ran into him at the entrance earlier. He should be arriving shortly," Xiao Xiong replied casually.

"Then you must already guess why I summoned you both. What's discussed here stays between us three." Jia Ren's sharp gaze fell on Guan Yu standing beside Xiao Xiong.

Xiao Xiong chuckled. "Ah, forgive my oversight. Let me introduce my superior—Guan Yu."

"Superior?" Jia Ren's eyebrows arched as he reassessed the unassuming young man.

"Indeed. All decisions now rest with him," Xiao Xiong confirmed with a slight bow. "Without his involvement, Commissioner Jia's goals today cannot be achieved."

**Chapter 626: Cheng Gui**

Jia Ren's brow furrowed. "You entrust everything to this... youth?" He emphasized the last word, skepticism dripping from his tone.

"Absolutely. Guan Yu now commands Mokai Enterprises. I serve under him," Xiao Xiong stated firmly.

The police chief nodded slowly. Having weathered countless storms to reach his position, he recognized that anyone capable of earning Xiao Xiong's loyalty must possess extraordinary qualities, regardless of age.

"Young man," Jia Ren addressed Guan Yu directly for the first time, "I trust you understand the gravity of this situation. Do not act rashly."

"Rest assured, Commissioner. The only impulsiveness here will come from Cheng Gui," Guan Yu replied smoothly, sipping his tea with a faint smile.

Jia Ren's expression remained neutral, though inwardly he disapproved of the youth's cavalier attitude. Ambition outpacing experience, he thought.

The door burst open as Cheng Gui entered with five bodyguards. "Such bold claims! Let's see if you can back them up," he sneered, venomous gaze locked on Guan Yu.

Though newly acquainted through Zhou Jin's warnings, Cheng Gui dismissed the young upstart. What could one man achieve against his empire? Still, he'd honor his agreement to eliminate this nuisance.

"Competence speaks louder than threats," Guan Yu retorted coldly.

Cheng Gui turned to Xiao Xiong with mock pity. "How your men must weep! Replacing you with this fledgling? You disgrace our rivalry."

Beneath his bluster, alarm bells rang. Had Zhou Jin betrayed him? The possibility of exposure made every word dangerous.

"Dogs bark louder than they bite," Xiao Xiong shot back. "At least I don't grovel as others' lapdog."

"Enough!" Jia Ren slammed the table. "I invited you to negotiate, not squabble!"

As silence fell, Guan Yu's smile deepened. His psychological warfare worked perfectly—Cheng Gui's paranoia about Zhou Jin's loyalty now festered.

When Jia Ren demanded Cheng Gui dismiss his guards, the gangster reluctantly complied after thinly veiled accusations. "One can't be too careful with assassins about," he jabbed, glaring at Xiao Xiong.

**Chapter 627: Cooperation**

"Let's be frank," Jia Ren began after the guards departed. "This bloodshed must end. For the city's peace, I propose a truce."

Cheng Gui lounged arrogantly. "Years of bad blood don't vanish over tea. Only when Xiao surrenders his territories will peace come."

Jia Ren's face darkened. "And you, Xiao Xiong?"

"All decisions rest with Guan Yu now," came the expected reply.

The police chief turned to the young strategist. "Your terms?"

"Cooperation requires mutual willingness," Guan Yu spread his hands. "If one side refuses..."

Jia Ren nodded, visibly relieved. "Then we understand each other." His glare returned to Cheng Gui. "Reconsider. Obstinacy will force... official measures."

The threat hung heavy. After prolonged silence, Cheng Gui rose with a murderous grin. "Law-abiding citizens like myself never trouble authorities. Unlike some." His neck-slitting gesture at Guan Yu punctuated the exit.

Alone with allies, Guan Yu's smile turned predatory. "Shall we discuss true cooperation, Commissioner?"

**Chapter 628: Mokai's Gambit**

Outside, Cheng Gui seethed. The chessboard had flipped—his advantage now a liability. Guan Yu's psychological warfare exploited every weakness, turning Jia Ren against him.

"Guan Yu," he spat, the name poison on his tongue. This upstart had outmaneuvered him using his own allies' distrust. By exposing the fragile Zhou Jin alliance, the youth had transformed certain victory into precarious stalemate.

Back in the private room, Guan Yu sipped tea, savoring his victory. The reckless feared the fearless, and he'd just proven which category he occupied. Through calculated provocation and strategic deference, he'd fractured enemy lines. Now came the true game—piece by piece, he'd dismantle their coalition until nothing remained.
