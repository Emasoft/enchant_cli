The young gentleman appeared to be at a severe disadvantage. Wielding a black fan less than a foot long against his opponent's longsword, he could only parry and dodge without any opportunity to counterattack. It was clear he would eventually lose—let alone have any chance of seizing the embroidered ball above.

Sure enough, after mere exchanges, the young man was kicked to the ground. Before he could react, the cold edge of the sword pressed against his throat, sealing his defeat.

“Thank you for your mercy, young lady,” the gentleman said courteously after rising, shaking his head ruefully before stepping off the stage.

The crowd now realized that Miss Dong, despite her ethereal beauty resembling a celestial maiden, was also a martial arts master far beyond the skill of ordinary challengers.

Xiao Mei giggled, nudging Guan Yu. “Look how formidable she is! Such a stunning beauty. Don’t you want to test your skills? If you win, you’d gain both a gorgeous wife and the Dong family’s vast fortune. Why not seize the chance?”

“I’ve no interest,” Guan Yu replied flatly, glancing at Si Qi beside him. He cursed Xiao Mei inwardly—the troublemaker knew Si Qi was present yet still provoked him.

If Guan Yu dared step onto that stage, Si Qi would surely skin him alive and banish him from their bed tonight. Though outwardly cold, Si Qi burned fiercely in matters of love. She’d never tolerate him pursuing another woman under her nose.

Moreover, Guan Yu knew Si Qi would spare him but unleash her wrath on Miss Dong instead. The Dong heiress would face dire consequences if he won.

“Hah! It’s not lack of interest but fear of Si Qi, isn’t it?” Xiao Mei teased. “What man wouldn’t covet such wealth and beauty? Don’t pretend you’re immune.”

As Guan Yu prepared to argue—truthfully, he lacked neither beauty nor admiration in his life, and Miss Dong, while striking, paled beside Si Qi and Wang Xiaorong in his eyes—Xiao Mei cut him off. To Guan Yu, every woman by his side outshone the Dong heiress, at least in his view.

Even without Si Qi’s presence, Guan Yu wouldn’t participate. He had greater ambitions and no time for distractions. Winning would entangle him as the Dong family’s son-in-law—a role he vehemently rejected.

Xiao Mei’s goading was pure mischief, and Guan Yu refused to bite. “Si Qi’s presence isn’t the reason. I simply find the Dong heiress unremarkable. Compared to her, my Si Qi is far more radiant.”

He aimed to placate Si Qi, whose mood had soured in this unwelcome setting. Her discomfort was palpable, and Guan Yu’s praise instantly lifted her spirits. A blush crept across her cheeks as she smiled, mollified.

Xiao Mei rolled her eyes, but before she could retort, a new challenger ascended the stage—prompting gasps from the crowd.

**Chapter 4675: The Troublemaking Old Man**

The contender was an elderly man with snow-white hair, standing barely shoulder-high to Miss Dong.

“They’re seeking a son-in-law, not a grandfather!” someone jeered. “A geezer like you after a young bride? Have some shame!”

The wrinkled old man shrugged. “The rules mention no age limit. Anyone may compete for the embroidered ball. I’m unmarried—why shouldn’t I try?”

Guan Yu murmured, “That old man’s no ordinary fool. Miss Dong might struggle against him.”

“The Dongs will never allow this farce,” Xiao Mei scoffed.

“Off the stage, you disgrace!” another spectator shouted.

Miss Dong frowned, glancing helplessly at her father seated offstage. The elder remained silent as the crowd’s heckling intensified.

“Your esteemed family set the terms,” the old man declared. “No restrictions on age or gender! Even a woman could compete!”

“Enough sophistry! Leave!” the crowd roared, but the man stood firm, unperturbed by insults.

Guan Yu observed the stalemate. The Dongs faced a dilemma: forcibly remove him and risk dishonor, or let the charade continue. The old man likely sought concessions, but if he somehow won…

Amid the chaos, Xiao Mei suddenly vanished—only to reappear onstage.

“Xiao Mei! Get down here!” Guan Yu shouted.

She ignored him, waving cheerfully. Si Qi frowned. “What’s she doing? Adding to the mess?”

“They’re choosing a groom, not a bride!” Guan Yu called. “Why are you up there?”

“Helping Miss Dong, of course!” Xiao Mei retorted. “Since rules permit anyone, why can’t I join?”

Understanding her intent, Guan Yu relented. Xiao Mei approached Miss Dong, craning her neck to meet the taller woman’s gaze. “A fairy like you shouldn’t wed a withered stump. Right, everyone?”

The crowd roared approval, hurling abuse at the old man. Miss Dong, flustered by Xiao Mei’s bold charm, hesitated.

“Let’s team up and drive him off!” Xiao Mei proposed. “Then we’ll duel properly.”

Though unorthodox, the plan won the crowd’s support. The old man scowled. “Two against one? Is this the Dong family’s honor?”

“Shameless lecher!” Xiao Mei shot back. “Leave now or face us!”

The old man smirked. “Very well. If I win, I’ll claim both brides!”

**Chapter 4676: Dislike**

Miss Dong felt a pang of envy—Xiao Mei’s beauty rivaled her own.

As the trio clashed, Miss Dong lunged with her rapier while the old man parried effortlessly with his cane. Xiao Mei chanted, summoning a whirlwind that gathered debris into a spinning orb above her palms.

“A cultivator!” the old man spat. “No matter!” His cane flicked, striking Miss Dong’s abdomen and sending her flying toward Xiao Mei.

Xiao Mei launched her debris-sphere, but the old man split into phantom copies, evading the attack. The projectile smashed harmlessly into a distant wall.

“He’s too strong!” Miss Dong gasped, clutching her stomach.

Xiao Mei glanced desperately at Guan Yu, silently pleading for aid.
