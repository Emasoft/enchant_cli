“It really does hurt a bit. Those fools are driving me mad.” Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) sat down, massaging her delicate foot as she spoke.

Guan Yu had barely waited at the entrance for a moment when a disciple hurriedly relayed the message: he was to enter immediately without delay. Anyone causing postponement would face the young master’s wrath.

Soon, Guan Yu stood at the doorway and asked, “What are you two doing? May I come in?”

Upon seeing the two women, Guan Yu was momentarily speechless. Their disheveled appearances—loose robes, unbound hair cascading over shoulders, bare feet playing on the floor, and sashes untied—defied all notions of refined beauty.

“Guan Yu, you’re here!” Wang Xiaorong beamed. Qiqi (Precious Jade), also barefoot, scampered over and tugged his sleeve. “Handsome Master, come in quickly and close the door!”

After pulling him inside, Qiqi shut the door and complained, “You’ve no idea! Madam got so angry earlier she overturned the chessboard. I was about to win, but I think she did it on purpose.”

“Is that so?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Why not start a new game?”

“I’m brilliant at chess,” Qiqi declared. “Learned from Grandpa since childhood. Madam can’t beat me.”

Wang Xiaorong’s worries vanished at Guan Yu’s presence. “Why so late? Didn’t you reach Qujiang City? I planned to bring Qiqi to visit tomorrow.”

Guan Yu sighed inwardly—these two indeed tracked his every move. Had he not come tonight, they’d have sought him out tomorrow. “We depart at dawn, so this is my only chance to see you.”

“So soon?” Disappointment tinged her voice. “Won’t you rest in the city longer?”

“We’ve only traveled half a day. No need for extended rest,” Guan Yu replied.

“How vexing! Perhaps I should cause some trouble to delay you,” Wang Xiaorong mused, tapping her chin.

Guan Yu smiled wryly. “Save your efforts. My journey to Miao City can’t be avoided. The sooner I go, the quicker I’ll return.”

Knowing Guan Yu wouldn’t let her accompany him, Wang Xiaorong dropped the matter. “Is the Demon Sovereign still in seclusion?” Guan Yu asked, concerned about the impending struggle for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.

“Yes. Why? Father hasn’t emerged since entering retreat,” she answered.

“Listen—don’t show him the crossbow I gave you yet,” Guan Yu cautioned. “Cloud Azure Sect’s production lags. Each finished piece takes two days. If Demon Soul Sect mass-produces them first, it’ll look like I leaked the designs.”

“Heavens! Why didn’t you say sooner?” Wang Xiaorong gasped. “I already told Father about it! He even saw the blueprint! What if they’ve started crafting?”

“You must slow your progress, or I’ll pay dearly,” Guan Yu urged.

Qiqi shyly interjected, “Handsome Master, Madam’s crossbow is amazing! With such a weapon, why learn martial arts? May I have one too?”

“Qiqi,” Guan Yu gently admonished, “tools can’t replace true skill. They aid but don’t protect like cultivated strength. When proper materials arrive, I’ll make you one.”

“Thank you, Handsome Master!” Qiqi brightened. “I’ve mastered the moves you taught! Shall I demonstrate?”

“She practices diligently daily, eager to show you,” Wang Xiaorong added proudly.

Qiqi began her forms—small yet agile, her punches sharp with surprising inner energy. Guan Yu applauded, “Excellent! Now focus on cultivating your inner energy. Master that, and I’ll teach more techniques.”

“Just keep following the meditation口诀 (mnemonic chant),” Guan Yu advised. “Remember—patience and focus are vital. Still your mind during practice.”

Surveying the room, Guan Yu noted new garments on a stand—clearly Qiqi’s. “Do you two share this chamber?” he asked, knowing Wang Xiaorong’s notorious fastidiousness.

“Why not?” she retorted.

“Your cleanliness obsession…I recall you barred others from touching your belongings.”

“I adore Qiqi, so exceptions are made,” Wang Xiaorong shrugged. Qiqi piped up, “But her rules! I can’t touch her clothes, bedding, or cabinets. We share the room but sleep apart. My robes stay on that rack—never the wardrobe.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “You’re already favored, Qiqi. Others aren’t permitted entry.”

Qiqi conceded, “It’s true—Madam treats me kindly with delicacies and fun. But the chef’s dishes! So fragrant!” Leaning in, she whispered, “Psst—Madam’s skin glows white at night, and her scent perfumes the whole room!”

“You little traitor!” Wang Xiaorong flushed. “Must you reveal everything?”

Guan Yu grinned. “I discovered that earlier.” Wang Xiaorong’s cheeks burned, recalling their forest tryst. Yearning stirred—how long since they’d been intimate? But with Qiqi present…

“Stay tonight,” Wang Xiaorong implored.

“Inappropriate with Qiqi here,” Guan Yu demurred.

“Close your eyes when she changes! Must you gaze elsewhere?” she huffed. “Stay by my bedside!”

Guan Yu sighed. “I’ll return to the inn. Qiqi—practice well and visit your grandparents when needed.”

“Don’t go!” Wang Xiaorong clung to him. “You’ll be gone a month! Is it because of that lovely senior sister Siqi? You’re taking her to the desert instead of me!”

Guan Yu paled—how did she know? “She’s our desert guide. Elder Dai saved her from sands long ago. Leader Xuanming assigned her for experience.”

**Chapter 4330: Drinking With Mood**

Wang Xiaorong relented, though unease lingered. Guan Yu’s charm attracted admirers—how could she compete?

As tensions eased, Qiqi watched silently. Guan Yu checked the hour. “I must leave.”

“Stay till dawn!” Wang Xiaorong pleaded.

“Impossible. The journey demands rest.”

Her eyes narrowed. “Is Siqi truly just a comrade?”

“Absolutely.”

“Then prove it—stay!”

Guan Yu wavered, torn between duty and affection. Outside, night deepened—the desert’s call loomed, but love’s pull held stronger tonight.
