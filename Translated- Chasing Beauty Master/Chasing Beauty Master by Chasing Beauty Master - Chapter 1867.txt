Chapter 4907: Deliberate Provocation

“Why are you staring at me? She’s the one insisting on going. I never wanted to tag along,” Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) retorted with a huff.

“Are you two ganging up to bully me?” Guan Yu (Universe) complained, frustration evident on his face. “You should be making my life easier, not causing more trouble. With you two around, I can’t even move freely!”

“Look at him, Sister Xiaorong,” Qiqi (Jade) said, refusing to back down. “Guan Yu’s already嫌弃us. He won’t take us to the Prince Consort’s Residence because he wants to meet Jiang Xin (Heart) alone! We’re just in his way, aren’t we?”

Guan Yu grew even more exasperated. Despite her youth, Qiqi’s mind worked alarmingly fast—she’d somehow pieced together his unspoken worries. He’d assumed she merely wanted to visit the Prince Consort’s estate for amusement, but now it was clear: she intended to stick to him like glue, fearing he’d seek out Jiang Xin (Heart).

“Sister Xiaorong,” Qiqi pressed, “we can’t just let him go! Look at him—he’s practically a walking temptation! The way Jiang Xin (Heart) stares at him… Anyone can see she’s scheming! If we let him go alone, next time we stroll through town, there’ll be another woman trailing him!”

*Such a sharp tongue for a little imp!* Guan Yu marveled inwardly, astonished by the depth of her suspicions. Outwardly, he could only manage a helpless grimace.

Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) sighed dramatically. “Qiqi’s right, but what can we do? We’ve fallen for a man who attracts trouble like a magnet. If fate brings more women, no amount of guarding will stop it. We’re doomed to suffer.”

Their act escalated—clutching each other in mock despair, they painted Guan Yu as a heartless scoundrel. He finally saw through their charade: they were united in teasing him.

“Enough!” Guan Yu threw up his hands. “Jiang Xin (Heart) is Chu Fan (Mortal)’s woman! Even if I were the worst kind of man, I’d never betray a sworn brother. Do you truly think me so despicable?”

Though Jiang Xin (Heart) was undeniably charming, Guan Yu’s loyalty to Chu Fan (Mortal) outweighed any fleeting attraction. A man’s honor mattered more.

“You might resist,” Qiqi (Jade) shot back, “but what if she throws herself at you? Women pursuing men? That’s an easy victory!”

“Fine, I surrender!” Guan Yu groaned. “I’ll cancel the visit and summon Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) here instead. Will that satisfy you?”

Relieved by his compromise, Qiqi (Jade) relented. “Go on then. We’ll wait here and resign ourselves to fate.”

“Finally, sense prevails!” Guan Yu exclaimed, relieved to placate them. Persuading these two had been harder than facing a martial arts master. Summoning a Prince Consort would’ve been discourteous, but their antics left him no choice.

In truth, Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) and Qiqi (Jade) merely wanted to remind him of their presence—preemptive strikes against potential rivals. Leaving them at the Demon Soul Sect’s tavern (a secure location), Guan Yu headed to the Prince Consort’s Residence alone.

Guards, preemptively instructed by Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening), ushered Guan Yu directly to a reception hall. “Please wait here, Young Master Wanhong. His Lordship will arrive shortly.”

Soon, Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) entered with a servant bearing tea. “Brother Wanhong! Your promptness honors me. Please, sit!”

“Brother Jiang,” Guan Yu replied, cutting to the chase. “Your daughter informed me you sought counsel. How may I assist?”

Dismissing the servant, Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) leaned forward. “The East Sea Dragon Pearl. My men have scoured the lands but found nothing. You discovered it—surely you know more?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “When I found the pearl in Swordless Mountain’s caves, I knew only its legend. Its secrets remain beyond me.”

“Yet my men found no caves there,” Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) pressed, skepticism flickering.

Guan Yu smiled. “Swordless Villa’s mysteries elude most. Did your men even locate the estate’s entrance? The mountain’s illusions guard its treasures. I stumbled into the cave by chance during a迷阵 (maze formation).”

Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) nodded, convinced. “Destiny favors the worthy. Recently, clues led me to a fishing village twenty kilometers east. Have you heard of it?”

*The fishing village again?* Guan Yu’s mind raced—first the Qin family’s troubles, now this. “I know of its thriving trade. Rumor says Qu Hua embezzled Qin Huan’s profits there. The Qins are in turmoil.”

“Astonishing! Your情報 (intelligence) surpasses mine.” Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) marveled. “The Qins attacked you, suffered losses, and now internal strife? They’re crumbling!”

Changing the subject, Guan Yu warned, “With treasure hunters flocking to the capital, Lady Jiang (Heart) should avoid outings. Danger looms.”

Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) paled. “She left this morning and hasn’t returned! You saw her—”

“At dawn, she departed Red Charm Theater!” Guan Yu interjected. “She should’ve returned hours ago!”

“Disaster!” Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) roared, mobilizing guards.

Princess Royal arrived, icy composure masking her fury. “If harm befalls my daughter,驸马 (Prince Consort), you’ll answer for it.”

Guan Yu confirmed Jiang Xin (Heart)’s disappearance. Guards scoured the capital fruitlessly. As dusk fell, Guan Yu departed, the Princess Royal’s carriage racing toward the palace.

By nightfall, the abduction of the Prince Consort’s daughter ignited uproar across the capital. At the palace gates, guards knelt as the Princess Royal’s golden token gleamed—a silent storm brewed.

Chapter 4908: Well-Informed

Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) paced, tormented. “They’ll demand the Dragon Pearl for her safe return. Let them take it—they’ll regret crossing me!”

Guan Yu advised restraint. “They want the pearl, not her life. Rashness endangers her.”

Investigations revealed Jiang Xin (Heart) and her maids had vanished utterly. Desperate, Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening) deployed all five hundred guards.

Guan Yu, excluded from the search, returned to the tavern. Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) and Qiqi (Jade) awaited news, their earlier mischief replaced by worry.

“It’s the Cao family,” Guan Yu muttered, recalling Du Teng’s warning. Without proof, accusations were premature.

Meanwhile, the Princess Royal stormed the imperial palace. Guards scrambled as her carriage thundered through gates opened wide for her token—a harbinger of imperial wrath.

Chapter 4909: Consuming Anxiety

Jiang Yuanhai (Origin Opening)’s dread deepened with each fruitless report. The capital’s underbelly stirred—adventurers, mercenaries, and spies now hunted the Dragon Pearl and its kidnapped key.

Guan Yu brooded, piecing together clues. *The fishing village connects Qin’s troubles and the pearl. But how?*

At the palace, the Emperor received his sister’s frantic plea. By midnight, imperial edicts mobilized the city guard. Jiang Xin (Heart)’s face adorned wanted posters—a kingdom’s might bent on her rescue.

Yet Guan Yu sensed deeper machinations. In shadows, the Cao family’s silhouette loomed—patient, venomous, and utterly ruthless.
