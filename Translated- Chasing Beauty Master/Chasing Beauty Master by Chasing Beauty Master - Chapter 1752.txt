“Are you from the Red Lotus Sect? Here seeking Miao City? Found anything?” Guan Yu asked coldly. He recognized them as Red Lotus disciples by their robes, though he’d never met these two.

“Indeed, we are Red Lotus disciples,” the other replied politely. “Our Elder sent us to investigate after spotting your group.”

“We’re from the Heterodox Sect,” Guan Yu declared. “Though small, we’re known in these deserts. Our mission is merely to survey the terrain.”

His disdain for the Red Lotus Sect ran deep, particularly due to Lai Lixia and Yue Jing—two disciples who’d thoroughly tarnished the sect’s reputation. Yet he was surprised a Red Lotus Elder had come personally. Their commitment to seizing the Eight-Sided Drum Technique must be absolute.

“Many factions gather in the desert lately,” Guan Yu pressed. “What brings your sect here?”

“That’s none of your concern. Farewell.” The disciple departed rudely, content with having learned the “Heterodox Sect” name to report.

Though Guan Yu’s first impressions of the sect had been poisoned by Lai Lixia and Yue Jing, he acknowledged the Red Lotus remained a righteous order. Their Sect Leader might be unknown to him, but several Elders were reputedly honorable. How such a sect could nurture those two hypocrites baffled him—perhaps they’d mastered the art of deception, charming their superiors with false obedience and talent while revealing their true colors elsewhere.

Watching the Red Lotus camp from afar, Guan Yu muttered, “So even they’ve come in force with an Elder leading. Miao City won’t know peace.”

Siqi stood silently beside him as Wang Jun added, “Every group we meet has fifty to sixty members. Even minor sects like Highland Faction outnumber us. Barely a dozen here—it seems Azure Cloud Sect truly lacks successors.”

“Nonsense!” Siqi snapped. “Quality trumps quantity. Hundreds would only drain supplies in this desert. Numbers mean nothing here.”

Guan Yu interjected, “Both viewpoints hold truth. While large groups waste resources, small ones risk being overwhelmed. The Red Lotus brought sixty-odd disciples and an Elder—they’re determined to claim the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.”

“Let the Demonic Soul Sect and Red Lotus clash with their hordes. If we keep our identities hidden, we’ll avoid becoming targets.”

Siqi nodded. “None would expect Azure Cloud to send so few. Maintain secrecy, and major conflicts can be avoided.”

Yet Guan Yu harbored private doubts. With Demonic Soul spies infiltrating Azure Cloud, their departure might have been reported long ago. The enemy likely knew their numbers already.

**Chapter 4583: Concealed Identities**

Though few, Guan Yu remained confident. Neither Red Lotus Elders nor Demonic Soul numbers intimidated him. Unless their Grand Elder came—unlikely—regular Elders matched Azure Cloud’s peak experts at best. In single combat, he feared none.

His pursuit of the Eight-Sided Drum Technique wasn’t for the sect, but himself. Mastering it might break the seal in his mind, restoring his Peak Realm Sovereign power—the key to reclaiming everything.

His cultivation progressed steadily. His spiritual river widened daily, spellcasting smoother than ever. In raw spiritual power, he now rivaled Siqi—remarkable given her lifelong training versus his single year.

Once restored to peak strength, he’d return to Huaxia unafraid of even the Yang Family Patriarch. Protecting Zhang Han would then be effortless. Until then, he’d bide his time—returning prematurely would only invite humiliation.

Regret gnawed at him. Had he refused Yang Conghan’s demand for the Realm Sovereign’s Relic, the Yang Patriarch might already be dead. Instead, the relic’s power would soon make the man a Realm Sovereign himself—a foe Guan Yu couldn’t presently challenge. His absence now protected Zhang Han, buying time before the Yangs moved against her.

“Pathetic,” he mused bitterly. Whether in Huaxia or here, weakness forced him to hide—from the Demon Sovereign’s schemes, from Xuan Ming’s condescension. Survival required patience until his strength returned.

**Chapter 4584: Notorious Reputation**

“The Red Lotus ahead,” Wang Jun warned. “Given our history, perhaps we should detour. They outnumber us.”

Guan Yu scoffed. “We’re ‘Heterodox Sect’ now. Major sects conserve strength for Miao City. Their Elder will prioritize rationality over petty squabbles.”

Detouring wasted time—their path inevitably reconverged.

“But Lai Lixia or Yue Jing might recognize us!” Wang Jun protested.

“Unlikely,” Guan Yu assured. “Their Elder won’t attack fellow righteous sect members. United against the Demonic Soul Sect matters more.”

The group agreed. Revealing their Azure Cloud identity might even gain Red Lotus assistance. Yet Guan Yu wondered—how had the Red Lotus pinpointed Miao City’s location? Perhaps demonkind among them guided the way...

**Chapter 4585: Demonkind Guides**

Approaching the Red Lotus camp at dusk, they found their path blocked. “We’re settled here. Detour elsewhere,” a disciple barked.

As Guan Yu negotiated, Xiao Mei snapped, “In all my desert years, I’ve never met such unreasonable folk! You block the only smooth path!”

The Red Lotus Elder—Madam Zhao—emerged, her white hair belying youthful features. Guan Yu bowed. “Esteemed Elder, surely a great sect won’t hinder humble travelers?”

“You claim Heterodox Sect allegiance?” Madam Zhao’s gaze lingered on Xiao Mei. Recognition flickered—this “sect leader” was demonkind. A guide to Miao City?

“Let them pass,” she decided abruptly. Demonic allies could prove useful...
