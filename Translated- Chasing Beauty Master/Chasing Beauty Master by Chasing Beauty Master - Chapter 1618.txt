After hearing Hongren’s love story, Wang Xiaorong felt indignant. Among all things she detested, lovers being unable to unite was one of her greatest dislikes.

“This is infuriating! Are you both fools? Do you still think of her in your heart?” Wang Xiaorong asked angrily.

Hongren nodded without denial. “I suppose so. But after all these years, the feelings have faded. Knowing she’s living well puts my mind at ease.”

Only then did Guanyu realize Hongren was a man of extraordinary magnanimity. Most men could hardly let go of their emotions, let alone abandon the woman they loved. If the beloved were truly beyond reach, that would be different. Yet the woman Hongren loved was right before him, and he relinquished her so effortlessly, finding peace in her happiness. This deeply moved Guanyu, for such selflessness was rare.

Humans are inherently selfish, especially in matters of the heart. Love, at its core, is possessiveness. Even if one’s beloved finds happiness with another, the ache remains unless possession is achieved. Some might even resort to extreme measures if denied. Men like Hongren were truly uncommon.

Yet each person has their own path. Hongren’s attitude might have sacrificed his own desires, but such nobility was beyond ordinary comparison.

Wang Xiaorong declared, “Where is Yu Qianqian now? I’ll go reason with her! How could she marry someone else so irresponsibly?”

Guanyu smiled wryly. “Don’t stir trouble. We have no leisure for this, nor is it on our way. The matter is settled—your interference would only harm your health. Calm yourself.”

Confronted with such injustice, Wang Xiaorong’s aristocratic temper flared. “Fine, keep traveling! Hongren, tell me where Yu Qianqian lives. I’ll go find her!”

Truthfully, if Wang Xiaorong insisted on going, no one could stop her. Yet if she went, Guanyu would have to follow—a complication Prince Zou would never permit. Moreover, the detour would be arduous, and after so many years, even finding Yu Qianqian would change nothing. Guanyu saw no point.

“Save your efforts. Decades have passed, and she lives well. Since Hongren won’t disturb her, neither should we,” Guanyu urged.

Only Guanyu could dissuade her thus. Anyone else would fail.

Wang Xiaorong turned away, still sulking. Guanyu added, “This cannot be undone. Why dwell on it? If you wish to help, find Hongren a good match instead.”

“Exactly!” Wang Xiaorong brightened instantly, her mood shifting like flipping a page. “I’ll find him a wonderful bride! The best way to forget someone is to love another. Once we reach Bajia City, I’ll scout the perfect girl! Hah, I can’t wait to arrive now!”

She spoke with infectious enthusiasm, as though it were already decided. Guanyu smiled faintly, knowing better than to contradict her temper.

**Chapter 4203: Continuous Journey**

Guanyu changed the subject. “Hongren, you know this area well? What lies ahead?”

Hongren pointed forward. “I grew up here. We’ll soon exit these woods and enter Bajia City’s territory. The road widens, though hills make it uneven.”

“Fewer woods mean fewer ambush risks,” Guanyu mused. “Yet it’s odd—no attacks in such ideal terrain. Once we’re past, open视野 should deter埋伏.”

Prince Zou, inside the carriage, shared this puzzlement. The woods had offered perfect埋伏 ground for imperial guards, yet none struck.

Hongren warned, “Hills ahead still pose埋伏 risks. Stay vigilant.”

“We must remain cautious,” Guanyu agreed.

The imperial guards would not relent. Nearing the capital, their forces grew—joined by Queen Guifen’s elite troops. The guards had prepared to ambush Prince Zou at Shangzhen, but miscalculated his route to Bajia City instead. Now scrambling to intercept, they lacked time to埋伏 in the woods.

Exiting the forest, the caravan entered open plains—safer视野. As dusk fell, Prince Zou ordered camp. Rest here allowed recovery before tackling the hills tomorrow.

Guanyu advised, “Resting tonight preserves strength. Traversing hills by daylight is safer.”

Prince Zou disagreed. “The guards haven’t mobilized yet. We should press forward—reach Bajia City before they regroup.”

Though risky, Guanyu yielded. After a meal, the group marched onward under darkening skies. Torches lit the way, compressing the caravan into tighter formation. Guanyu rode mid-column, eyes closed to conserve energy.

Wang Xiaorong yawned. “I’m exhausted. Can I sleep on Xiao Hong’s back?”

Guanyu draped his cloak around her. “Sleep here instead.” He pulled her onto his horse, securing her against his chest.

“Your embrace is warm,” Wang Xiaorong murmured, drifting off. Guanyu tethered her horse and sank into meditative awareness—sensing every挠头, hummed tune, and rustling grass.

His consciousness turned inward, noting the turbulent black vortex in his mind—the seal—and his swelling spiritual reservoir. Memories flickered: an icy cavern, a beast, Xue Jing injured… Fragments from the seal?

Alarmed, Guanyu entered the Imperial Seal’s realm. Once foggy, it now revealed metallic walls inscribed with the Eight-Drum Art and stored spells. The artifact’s spirit was absent, but its chambers held secrets waiting to be unlocked.
