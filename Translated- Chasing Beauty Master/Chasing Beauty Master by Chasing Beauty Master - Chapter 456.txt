“Back…” Yin Ye’s expression remained unchanged as he flicked the yellow banner again. The golden dragon rebounded with tremendous force, crashing viciously into Wang Xiaojun’s horrified face.

*Thud…*

The man flew backward, blood spraying from his mouth. Wang Xiaojun’s body hurtled through the air like a ragged sack before slamming to the ground with a sickening crunch. Drenched in blood, he lay motionless—if not dead, at least grievously wounded.

“This is beyond humiliation!” roared Perfected Person Zi Chen of Heavy Sword Palace, finally reacting. Wang Xiaojun had fallen too swiftly and brutally for anyone to intervene. “A friendly spar among fellow cultivators, yet you strike to kill?”

“Heh. Injuries are inevitable in combat,” retorted Daoist Xu with a strained chuckle, clearly unsettled by Yin Ye’s ferocity but compelled to defend his sect’s disciple. “Does Heavy Sword Palace lack the backbone to accept defeat?”

“So this is the face of Central Plains sects?” sneered Elder Liu Ya of the Carefree Sect, rising with a cold laugh. “When your own disciples suffer later, don’t blame us Three Outer Sects for showing no mercy. Our fates are now intertwined.”

“Bring whatever tricks you have,” Yin Ye retorted icily, descending from the arena. A flicker of ruthlessness crossed his eyes.

“Yin Ye shits the bed, and we’re left to clean it. Typical of Kunlun to play the overbearing patriarch,” Guan Yu muttered bitterly. The vicious assault had shattered any pretense of civility, igniting tensions between factions.

“So this is their scheme—colluding with the Carefree Sect? Clever. But do they truly think victory is assured?” Guan Yu’s knuckles whitened as he clenched his fists. Years in the underworld had taught him to recognize treachery. To harm others, one must first avoid being harmed.

“Master, why is Yin Ye so powerful?” Guan Yu pressed, studying his opponent.

“Nascent Soul cultivation, a divine soul artifact, Mid-stage Golden Core strength—combined, they make him formidable,” Wild Crane Daoist replied, eyes narrowing. “That artifact allows three strikes at most with his current cultivation. Sheer bullying—the Three Outer Sects lack such foundations.”

Guan Yu exhaled slowly. *So it’s borrowed power, limited to three attacks.* While terrifying, it wasn’t insurmountable. Wang Xiaojun’s defeat stemmed from being psychologically overwhelmed, manipulated by Yin Ye’s momentum.

The second match pitted Qingcheng Sect’s green-robed maiden Zuo Qingyi against Yun Xuanwu.

Unlike the previous swift duel, this became a drawn-out clash—the sharpest spear against the sturdiest shield.

“Forgive me, elder sister,” Zuo Qingyi murmured apologetically as violet light erupted from her sheath. “If fate allows, I’ll spar with you fairly another time. *Zi Ying, unsheathe!*”

Purple lightning—vast and terrible—obliterated Yun Xuanwu’s nineteen layered defenses in an instant, hurling her from the arena. Yun stared blankly, baffled by her defeat.

“Master, this…” Guan Yu felt the weight of Central Plains’ legacy for the first time. Whether Yin Ye’s Apricot Yellow Banner or Zuo Qingyi’s violet sword, these artifacts radiated invincibility.

“Tools are part of a cultivator’s strength,” Wild Crane Daoist deflected, avoiding his disciple’s gaze. Clearly, he’d anticipated these developments.

“Then why don’t *I* have one?” Guan Yu complained, wondering if their White Cloud Temple’s lower status explained the lack.

“Those artifacts require decades of nurturing to wield. Even if I gave you one now, could you use it?” The Daoist’s smile turned sly. “But don’t you prefer defeating Qing fairly?”

The subsequent matches unfolded predictably. Xu Qianfeng, a Heavy Sword Palace prodigy wielding three blades simultaneously, clashed with Jiuhua Mountain’s Fa Neng. Despite dazzling swordplay, his strikes clanged harmlessly against Fa Neng’s golden body. A colossal Buddha palm descended, knocking Xu unconscious.

By the fourth round, the Three Outer Sects’ humiliation was complete. When Longhu Mountain’s Zhang Ziran faced Carefree Sect’s Liu Wancang, a flash of violet talisman light left Liu paralyzed before collapsing.

**Fifth Match: Guan Yu vs. Qing of Carefree Sect**

“Come up here, loser,” Qing spat, face ashen from his sect’s string of defeats.

Guan Yu stepped forward silently. He couldn’t fail—not just for himself, but for White Cloud Temple’s honor.

Qing formed hand seals, conjuring a colossal violet fist that plummeted like a meteor. Mist swirled around him, distorting his form.

Guan Yu stood motionless, head bowed—until a smirk twitched his lips.

“Think I’m still the same as before? *Break!*”

*Boom!*

He rocket-punched through the violet construct, dispersing it in a shockwave.

“*Lin!*” Guan Yu roared, forming the Immovable Wisdom King Seal. The mist shredded away, revealing Qing’s panicked figure.

“Found you!”

Their blurred figures clashed mid-air in a flurry of strikes. When they landed, Qing staggered seven steps back; Guan Yu, five.

“Heh. So this is all you’ve got?” Guan Yu wiped blood from his mouth, trembling not from fear but exhilaration.

“Impossible!” Qing raged, hair disheveled. “Two months ago you were trash!”

“Months are enough to surpass you. *Yield!*”

As Guan Yu formed the Wisdom Fist Seal, fiftyfold gravity crushed Qing. The latter summoned a green sword light, but it deflected harmlessly.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

Three brutal punches followed—retribution for past humiliations, a debt to Liu Rushi, and sheer dislike. The final blow sent Qing skidding from the arena.

The crowd stared, stunned. Some expected Guan Yu’s victory, but none foresaw such primal dominance—no techniques, no spells, just fists. Luck? Perhaps. But victory forgave all flaws.

“Everyone, hurry! The gate’s ahead!” Guan Yu led the charge through thickening mist, ancestral key glowing. “Damn—they’re here too soon. Did someone leak our path?”

“Demonic cultivators? Impossible! Wait—another group! We’re surrounded!” Zhang Ziran warned. The mist dulled spiritual senses, reducing them to mortal sight and sound. Only Guan Yu’s gravity manipulation countered the prowling fog beasts.

“They’re pinned by mist creatures. Brother Zhang, can we activate yesterday’s formation?” Guan Yu gritted his teeth. Two li—once a trivial distance—now stretched endlessly under siege.
