The old man nodded and said, “Exactly, my wife passed away just three days ago, but I’ve felt unbearably lonely these past few days. I wondered if I could find someone new to keep me company.”

Xiao Zhi thought to himself, *Wang Jun truly is something. The man’s wife died mere days ago, and he already knows about it?*

Wang Jun picked up a brush and asked, “May I know your surname?”

“My surname is Sheng—the character meaning ‘strange’ or ‘unfamiliar,’” the old man replied. Wang Jun wrote the character 生 (Sheng) on paper and continued, “Might I ask if your children are perhaps... overly filial?”

The old man nodded again. “Yes, they rarely visit. They only came back the day my wife died and left immediately afterward. Now I’m just a lonely old man with no one to care for me.”

“How could such ungrateful children abandon their own father? All those years raising them were wasted!” Xiao Zhi erupted indignantly.

The old man blinked in surprise, while Wang Jun grimaced inwardly. *I forgot to warn Xiao Zhi not to speak. His straightforward nature will ruin our business if he keeps this up.*

A fortune-telling master needed to maintain an air of dignified composure—especially since Xiao Zhi was supposed to be the senior master. Such outbursts were utterly unbecoming.

Wang Jun shot him a sharp glance. Only then did Xiao Zhi remember his role. Clearing his throat, he declared, “Esteemed elder, the young man beside me is my closed-door disciple. His skills now surpass my own. Rest assured, he will resolve your troubles.”

Wang Jun stared at the character 生 on the paper. The surname was indeed unusual. *How to spin this…*

“Elder Sheng,” Wang Jun began solemnly, “your situation is complex. A ritual is required.” After confirming the man’s age—born in the Year of the Ox—he retrieved a paper painted with an ox and laid it on the table. “Your surname ‘Sheng’ paired with your zodiac sign suggests prosperity—a life without want. Yet this ox also signifies children too busy to tend to you. Having lost your lifelong companion, your heart now yearns for new company.”

“Exactly! Master, you understand completely!” The old man sighed. “My health remains strong, but the house echoes with loneliness. My son offers to take me in, but I cannot bear to sell this home I’ve lived in all my life.”

Xiao Zhi’s earlier judgment softened. *I thought him a lecherous old fool seeking a new wife days after bereavement. How wrong I was.*

Wang Jun suddenly flung the ox painting upward. The paper burst into flames, burning completely within moments—yet the painted ox remained untouched by fire, its outline lingering in ash.

As the crowd murmured in awe, Wang Jun set the ash-ox on the table. “Your path forward is difficult. Even with a new companion, the past cannot be reclaimed. As the fire could not consume this ox, neither can time alter your stubborn nature. Heed your children. True happiness lies in family.”

The old man nodded slowly. “If even you say so, Master... I’ll follow your counsel. Yet parting with my home still pains me.”

“Keep the house,” Wang Jun advised. “Entrust its care to another. You may return whenever nostalgia calls.”

Moved, the elder placed a silver ingot on the table. “Your wisdom guides me, Master. I shall act as you suggest.”

As the old man departed, a plump, middle-aged woman approached, her face drawn with worry—the typical clientele of fortune-tellers.

**Chapter 3981: Fortune-Telling (Part 1)**

Some people clung stubbornly to superstition. Wang Jun greeted her: “Madam, what troubles bring you here?”

“Young man,” she asked skeptically, “are you the master here, or him? Are you father and son?”

Xiao Zhi interjected smoothly, “My disciple has inherited all my knowledge. His skills now eclipse mine. Speak freely.”

The woman hesitated before confessing, “My daughter-in-law remains childless after years of marriage. What curse plagues us?”

*Another tricky request,* Wang Jun mused. *But deception suffices.* “Provide their birth dates and times.”

As she recited, Wang Jun’s brush paused. The son, over thirty, had married a teenager—an unusual age gap, though not unheard of. The woman’s fine clothes suggested wealth; likely the bride came from poverty.

“How long has this marriage lasted? She isn’t his first wife?”

“Three years. You’re astute, Master—she’s his third.”

*Three wives, no children? The fault lies with the son.* Aloud, Wang Jun said, “Their astrological signs show no conflict. What is your son’s occupation?”

“He manages our stone quarry business since my husband’s passing.”

*Stone dust impairs fertility,* Wang Jun realized. “Madam, you seek the wrong help. This is a medical matter—your son should consult physicians. The problem lies with him, not his wives.”

He ignited the birth chart with a flourish, collected the ashes in yellow cloth, and handed it over. “Place this by his bedside. It may help.”

The woman gaped at the pyrotechnics, as did Xiao Zhi. Pressing silver into Wang Jun’s hand, she gushed, “Thank you, true master! Other charlatans would’ve taken my money!”

Wang Jun pushed the silver back. “Keep it until your daughter-in-law conceives. Only then return with payment.”

As the crowd buzzed with renewed interest, Xiao Zhi whispered, “Where’d you learn these tricks? Don’t say Cloud Azure Sect taught you this!”

Wang Jun chuckled. “Life teaches what sects cannot. Most ‘insights’ are common sense veiled by desperation.”

“Still impressive. You sounded utterly convincing!”

“Credit Guan Yu. He knew more than I ever will.”

Their conversation halted as a disheveled drunkard slumped at their table, reeking of alcohol. “When’ll I get a pretty wife?” he slurred.

Wang Jun maintained composure. “My services require payment—one tael per question.”

The drunk brandished silver. “Here! Answer!”

“You’ll never wed beauty,” Wang Jun stated flatly.

The crowd roared as the man erupted: “Swindler! Return my money!”

Wang Jun caught his swinging fist, jamming a brush handle into his mouth. “Payment covers truth, not lies. Should I claim you’ll wed tomorrow?”

As the drunk spat ink, Wang Jun flicked a hand. A wind spell sent him tumbling into the street.

**Chapter 3982: Fortune-Telling (Part 2)**

The drunk staggered up, screaming, “I’ll ruin your scam,骗子!”

Wang Jun smiled coldly. “Next question costs another tael.”

When the man produced more silver, Wang Jun declared, “You’ll die poor.”

Enraged, the drunk charged—only to eat brush bristles again. Wang Jun’s hidden wind spell sent him cartwheeling away, the crowd’s laughter echoing after him.
