At a certain location, he parted ways with two individuals. There was no helping it—he was about to meet Liu Shilei now. He couldn't very well arrive flanked by companions, lest he expend further effort placating her afterward.

He called Liu Shilei. An excited, delighted voice answered. They agreed to meet at her dormitory.

What might transpire during this dormitory rendezvous? Guan Yu rubbed his hands together in anticipation.

Now brimming with impatience, he hurried toward the faculty housing.

Yet en route, a panicked-looking young man blocked his path. Guan Yu frowned, recognizing the flustered figure—Wang Yang, Vice President of the Student Council. The same man who'd nearly had his pelvis crushed by an obese woman at that hotel. Guan Yu remembered him vividly.

"Wang Yang," Guan Yu teased, "shouldn't you be managing student affairs instead of accosting me?"

Wang Yang gripped Guan Yu's shoulder, panting unevenly. "That's... precisely why... I'm here. A gang's causing trouble outside campus. Wang Zhen and Tian Hao are confronting them with our men. I rushed to find you upon hearing of your return."

Guan Yu's smile vanished, his expression darkening. "Damned fools think they can stir chaos during my brief absence? Lead the way. Let's see which blind curs dare strut through my territory."

Before catching his breath, Wang Yang scrambled ahead. Oddly, his pace felt unnaturally swift. He attributed this to adrenaline, unaware Guan Yu had activated a gravitational manipulation system to hasten their progress.

Two factions faced off on campus grounds.

One group brandished steel pipes, youthful faces contorted with aggression—the Male Division of Guan Yu's Student Council. Leaders Wang Zhen and Tian Hao gripped their own pipes, glaring at their adversaries.

The opposing gang exuded street thug bravado—cigarettes dangling from lips, bulges at their waists hinting at concealed machetes.

Tian Hao's temper flared. "Xu Wei! What's the meaning of this? Think we'll tolerate your rabble invading our school?"

Xu Wei sneered. "Your Male Division? Let's witness its supposed might."

Wang Zhen retorted calmly yet pointedly: "We know your game, Xu Wei. Still bitter because Brother Yu stole your girl? Even if you brought the entire underworld, we'd still kick you beyond these gates."

Tian Hao guffawed. "You? Compete with Brother Yu for women? Piss on a mirror first! Keep lingering and I'll kick your ass myself!"

Xu Wei's face twisted. Since Wen Qing abandoned him for Guan Yu, he'd become the school's laughingstock. Love curdled into hatred—for Wen Qing's fickleness and Guan Yu's audacity in stealing both his beloved and Student Council presidency within days. His vengeance now targeted Guan Yu's domain.

"Save your bluster," Xu Wei spat. "Your precious Guan Yu languishes in jail, facing murder charges. What waves can you dead fish make now?"

A blond thug grew impatient. "Enough chatter. Let's carve these pricks into submission!" He drew his machete, followed by underlings brandishing gleaming blades.

Xu Wei's eyes glinted viciously. "Leave lasting lessons."

The blond charged toward Tian Hao's group.

"Cease!" A feminine shout froze all movement.

Wen Qing materialized—oval face, phoenix eyes, dewy skin flushed with anger. "Xu Wei! How could you attack former comrades?"

The sight transformed Xu Wei's features into a rictus of rage. "Comrades? After you whored yourself to Guan Yu? You're all targets now—especially you, two-timing slut!"

Wen Qing paled, stunned by this venom from her once-gentle suitor.

"Repeat that." A thunderous voice erupted from the crowd.

"Slut—" Xu Wei began, choking on the syllable as Guan Yu materialized before him like vengeful smoke.

Xu Wei's bravado dissolved into terror.

Guan Yu's voice dripped frost. "None harms my woman. You've provoked wrath beyond measure."

"Wha... what will you—"

Crack! Guan Yu's Triple Bone Fracture Fist, amplified by gravitational force, sent Xu Wei airborne. Three broken ribs clattered as he crumpled.

Enraged, the blond slashed at Guan Yu's shoulder. A sidestep and hammerfist later, the thug lay unconscious.

Guan Yu scanned the remaining hoodlums. "Who else seeks broken bones?"

Chapter 381: Elite Members

The gangsters exchanged glances, none daring advance. Guan Yu's display—materializing unseen, disabling two leaders instantly—paralyzed them with fear.

"Then remove this filth," Guan Yu commanded. "Return here, and consequences will escalate."

The mob scrambled to retrieve their leader, abandoning Xu Wei when Guan Yu growled: "Leave that trash."

Male Division members swelled with pride at their leader's dominance.

Tian Hao bounded forward. "Knew you'd emerge unscathed! Embrace your loyal subordinate!"

Guan Yu recoiled in mock horror as Wang Zhen chided: "Maintain dignity, Vice Director!"

Wang Zhen indicated thirty-odd newcomers. "These recruits remained loyal despite your arrest."

Tian Hao spat: "Cowards fled when rumors spread. Let them beg reentry now!"

Guan Yu appraised the steadfast remnant. "Quality over quantity. These need no vetting."

Wang Zhen presented their elite cadre:

Zhu Lin—chubby IT prodigy who refused National Security Bureau recruitment. "Too restrictive," the programmer chuckled. "Prefer life's simple pleasures."

Hu Ge—military scion with a colonel father. "I seek romantic conquests," the playboy grinned. "Teach me your ways, Brother Yu!"

Guan Yu rolled eyes as Wen Qing giggled: "His charm's inimitable."

Hu Ge persisted: "Let me bask in your aura! I'm your devoted disciple!"

Subsequent introductions revealed more promising talents—foundations for Guan Yu's future empire.

Approaching the whimpering Xu Wei, Guan Yu crouched low. "Test me again, and regret will redefine your existence."

The broken man groveled: "Never again, Brother Yu! My deepest apologies!"

Wen Qing watched in disgust—how had she ever dated this spineless worm?

After dismissing the troops, Guan Yu found himself alone with Wen Qing.

Her eyes smoldered. "Twice you've publicly claimed me. When will you... properly claim me?"

A resounding spank answered her. "Tonight," Guan Yu growled, kneading pliant flesh.

Her blush rivaled peonies. "I'll await... thoroughly."

Chapter 382: Tinder and Flame

Their last intimate encounter—Wen Qing's deflowering—remained unrepeated. Now her provocations ignited primal urges.

Guan Yu fled toward Liu Shilei's quarters, though Wen Qing's laughter pursued him.

Faculty residents eyed him warily—memories of restroom peeping incidents (orchestrated by Mo Ling) lingered. Guan Yu sighed; these aging pedagogues held no allure.

Liu Shilei answered his knock—pale perfection marred by tear tracks.

"I promised I'd return," Guan Yu murmured.

She collapsed against him, weeping relief into his neck as passing teachers gaped.

Inside her apartment, her lips found his with desperate hunger. Hands wandered, explored, claimed—until Guan Yu's palm cupped softness beneath blouse.

Outside, the academic world continued. Within, two lovers rekindled connection through breathless entanglement.
