Tang Mucheng (Wood Dust) pondered for a moment, feeling he should find something to do. He then declared, “Since these two beauties are new here, all their expenses today shall be on me.” He spoke loudly, intentionally ensuring those nearby—including the shopkeeper—could hear.

Upon hearing this, the crowd knew Tang Mucheng had set his sights on a new target. Whenever he found a new interest, he would be exceedingly generous—particularly with silver, as he had it in abundance.

Several women standing in the distance glared venomously at Wang Xiaorong (Little Hibiscus) and Qiqi (Jade). These women were Tang Mucheng’s hangers-on, clinging to him like body hair. Wherever he went, they followed. Only when Tang Mucheng angrily shouted at them to scram would they retreat—but once his temper cooled, they would return.

To them, Tang Mucheng was like their ancestor; even his farts smelled sweet, and his every word was law. They trailed after him like obedient lackeys.

Despite this, these women reaped many benefits. Pleasing Tang Mucheng often earned them rewards. Each secretly hoped to one day become his wife and secure a place in the Tang Family—their ultimate goal.

Yet this was no easy feat. Tang Mucheng’s standards were high, and while a few of these women were passably attractive, none met his discerning taste.

During lulls between new pursuits, Tang Mucheng would occasionally pick one to toy with. The women competed fiercely for such opportunities, even resorting to violence when rumors of his interest spread.

They all dreamed that a single night with him might lead to bearing the Tang Family’s heir. Even as a concubine, such a child would guarantee lifelong comfort—their true aim.

“So generous? You might not know this, but I’m a child who loves spending money the most,” Qiqi (Jade) retorted, widening her eyes pointedly. “Are you sure about what you just said?”

“Of course,” Tang Mucheng declared, straightening his posture. “My word is unbreakable. Treating two beauties is my honor and duty.”

Qiqi turned to Wang Xiaorong. “Sister Xiaorong, this handsome fellow’s asking for trouble. How should we torment him?”

Tang Mucheng’s smile stiffened. He’d expected gratitude, not mockery.

Wang Xiaorong glanced around. “He seems wealthy. I’ve never heard of this Capital City Tang Family, but since he’s so generous, we shouldn’t hold back.”

“Haha, I’m honored by your grace,” Tang Mucheng said, eyes gleaming.

Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong exchanged glances before the latter shouted, “Everyone, listen up! Today’s expenses for all patrons—and staff—are on me!”

Tang Mucheng gaped in disbelief as cheers erupted. The trap was clear: his promise to cover the women’s costs now extended to the entire crowd.

Wanyang Restaurant’s exorbitant prices—where pastries cost quadruple street prices and wine tenfold—meant this gesture would drain even the Tang Family’s coffers. Though willing to splurge on his targets, wasting silver on strangers pained his miserly heart.

As Tang Mucheng wavered, Guan Yu (Cosmos) approached with an amused smile. “Xiaorong, why this grand gesture?”

Wang Xiaorong explained, “Young Master Tang here vowed to cover our expenses. Since he’s so generous, we’re sharing the wealth!”

“Exactly!” Qiqi chimed. “Everyone’s treats are on this handsome gentleman. Let’s all thank him!”

Guan Yu turned to Tang Mucheng with mock admiration. “The famed Tang Family’s influence radiates through your generosity today!”

Though intended as sarcasm, Tang Mucheng preened at the praise. Forcing a smile, he addressed Guan Yu: “If I’m not mistaken, you’re the recently notorious Young Master Wan Hong (Vast). An unexpected pleasure.”

“The honor is mine,” Guan Yu replied. “To witness such magnanimity—a feast for the entire establishment! I’ll gratefully partake.”

“My generosity extends only to the ladies,” Tang Mucheng countered coldly. “I’ve no obligation to fund strangers’ excess.”

Guan Yu arched a brow. The man was shrewder than typical rich fools who’d bankrupt themselves for pride.

“A pity,” Guan Yu sighed, turning to the women. “You two caused quite the stir.”

Qiqi shrugged innocently. “We merely amplified his kindness!”

Guan Yu’s smile faded. Antagonizing another powerful family while already feuding with the Cao Family risked disaster. Before he could intervene, a crystalline voice rang out:

“Tang Mucheng! How dare you ignore my invitation!”

All eyes turned to the staircase where a vision in white descended. Her gown—more suited to a Western ballroom than this setting—dragged across pristine lambswool carpets. A dazzling crystal necklace accentuated her décolletage, its value surpassing entire estates.

Even Wang Xiaorong and the renowned Miss Jiang paled beside her radiance. This was Duan Ruxue (Resembling Snow)—the other half of the Capital City’s Twin Jewels, whose reclusiveness made her appearance miraculous.

Tang Mucheng’s jaw dropped. “M-Miss Duan! Your beauty struck me dumb! Forgive my earlier neglect!”

Duan Ruxue’s glare could freeze fire. “I summoned you. Explain yourself.”

“Had I known it was you!” Tang Mucheng groveled. “That incompetent servant failed to mention your presence!”

“I came specifically to discuss matters with you,” she declared, sweeping toward private quarters with two maids—a breach of Wanyang’s no-servants policy overlooked for her status.

As Duan Ruxue departed, Tang Mucheng’s elation overflowed. Being sought by the elusive Duan heiress was an unimaginable boon.
