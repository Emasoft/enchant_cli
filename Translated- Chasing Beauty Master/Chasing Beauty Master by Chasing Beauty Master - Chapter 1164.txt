“What’s so bad about it? I don’t think so,” Guan Yu chuckled. “Initially, I thought some low-level workers at the factory were involved in this matter. It didn’t seem like a big deal, so I simply reported it to the police for investigation. But I never expected you, Sun Xu, to be the mastermind behind it. In that case, I’m sorry—this matter will now be left to the police to handle.”

Sun Xu’s greatest fear was Guan Yu’s refusal to negotiate, and anxiety surged within him. “Guan Yu, let’s consider this my fault. I was forced by Bi Erlin to oppose you. Look at what he’s reduced me to—I need to survive, and the only way is to grovel by Bi Erlin’s side. I’m sure you understand. How about this? All the stolen leather is here. Take it back—you’ve suffered no losses. Spare me this once, and I swear I’ll never oppose you again.”

“Never oppose me again? I’ll treat your words as flatulence. I’ve given you chances, but you refused to take them. Don’t blame me now,” Guan Yu said coldly.

When Lin Qiaoqiao arrived with the police to arrest Sun Xu, he panicked and shouted, “Wait! Wait… Guan Yu! If you let me go this time, I’ll give you everything I have—over a million yuan in my account! Just spare me…”

Guan Yu turned away. “No need. Keep that money for police fines. Perhaps a few years in prison will do you good.”

Sun Xu and his accomplices were taken to the station. Sitting in the interrogation room, Sun Xu remained silent, demanding to speak only after his lawyer arrived and requesting permission to make a call.

After finally obtaining approval, Sun Xu dialed Bi Erlin’s number. “Young Master Bi! Disaster has struck! You must save me!”

“What’s all this shouting? Speak calmly,” said Bi Erlin, who had been in high spirits lately, collaborating with Luo Bo and the Poison Widow to plot their next move against Guan Yu. They had even planned to summon Ma Tong for discussions.

Sun Xu pleaded, “The police arrested me! They found the warehouse where I hid the leather. You must find a way to get me out!”

“Such a trivial matter requires my attention? You’ve been in the underworld for years—can’t even handle a few cops?” Bi Erlin scoffed, failing to grasp the leather factory’s significance.

“Do you no longer care about the leather factory’s affairs?”

Sun Xu’s reminder made Bi Erlin’s heart pound violently. “Guan Yu discovered it? What happened to the factory workers?”

“They were arrested too! If we don’t protect these men, we’ll never smuggle leather again,” Sun Xu said helplessly, knowing Bi Erlin could secure his release with money—nothing in China couldn’t be solved with wealth.

“What’s the situation now? Speak clearly, you imbecile!” Bi Erlin barked.

“Come to the station and bail me out—there’s still hope. Guan Yu found the stolen leather but doesn’t know about the client list yet.”

Hearing this, Bi Erlin relaxed. As long as Guan Yu remained unaware that their clients were plants, their plan could proceed. Even if large-scale theft became impossible, Guan Yu would still fail to meet contractual deadlines due to the pressure they’d exert on his factory through Ma Tong’s sabotage operations.

“Stay put at the station. I’ll arrange your release—it’s a minor issue,” Bi Erlin said before hanging up.

“What happened?” the Poison Widow inquired cautiously.

Bi Erlin smirked. “That idiot Sun Xu had his stash discovered by Guan Yu. The factory workers and Sun Xu are detained. They’re rotting at the station now.”

The Poison Widow advised, “We can’t abandon them. Given Mr. Feng’s local connections, let him intervene. If Sun Xu cracks under pressure and reveals our plans, everything collapses.”

Reluctantly agreeing, Bi Erlin realized Sun Xu might indeed betray them. “Goddamn nuisance! How could that moron get caught? Useless fool!”

Despite his rage, Bi Erlin followed the Poison Widow’s suggestion to seek Mr. Feng’s help. Unwilling to owe Feng favors, Bi Erlin first bribed him with a young college girl.

Delighted by the gift, Mr. Feng immediately contacted Deputy Bureau Chief Yan after hearing Bi Erlin’s request.

Deputy Chief Yan of the Central Bureau lounged in his office when his landline rang. Recognizing the number, he answered lazily, “Ah, Young Master Feng! To what do I owe this pleasure?”

Mr. Feng laughed. “Deputy Chief Yan jests! As old friends, we should communicate more. I’ve encountered a minor predicament, haha.”

Deputy Yan sneered, “Oh? Given current strict oversight, only trivial matters can be…”

“Chief Yan, your phone just received a notification, no? Perhaps check it?” Mr. Feng transferred funds as he spoke.

Glancing at his phone, Deputy Yan’s expression brightened at the sum. “Why, Young Master Feng’s troubles are mine! We’re practically family—speak freely!”

Mr. Feng inwardly cursed the greedy official before explaining, “A friend was arrested for pilfering factory goods at the South District Branch. Could you facilitate his release?”

“Tricky business! That branch’s notoriously rigid—especially their female detective captain. She answers to no one,” Deputy Yan demurred.

Recognizing the hint, Mr. Feng transferred another payment. “Surely a mere captain bows to your authority?”

Observing the increased balance, Deputy Yan relented. “For you, I’ll move mountains. Your friend’s name?”

“Sun Xu. Release his accomplices too, if possible. Many thanks, Chief Yan!”

“Consider it done.” Deputy Yan hung up, savoring the Feng family’s lavish bribes. However, he grimaced recalling the South Branch’s iron-fisted Captain Lin Qiaoqiao, who’d previously thwarted his attempts to free relatives.

Descending to meet Bi Erlin, Mr. Feng boasted, “As Feng heir, handling police matters is trivial—though it cost five hundred thousand.”

“A pittance! Is Sun Xu freed?” Bi Erlin pressed.

“Patience. These things take time.” Distracted, Mr. Feng approached the trembling college girl. “Such exquisite goods. Let’s… converse upstairs.”

As Mr. Feng indulged, Deputy Yan contacted South Branch Chief Gao—an obsessive lottery enthusiast—to negotiate Sun Xu’s release through further bribes.

“Chief Gao! Heard you won second prize recently?” Deputy Yan teased, knowing Gao’s lottery obsession.

“Old Yan, don’t mock me! Though my numbers are heating up—I’ll increase bets next round!” Gao rambled about lottery strategies until Deputy Yan interrupted.

“True wealth requires more than tickets. Check your account.” A transferred bribe silenced Gao.

“Sun Xu? Captain Lin’s case. She’s… inflexible,” Gao hedged after seeing the sum.

Deputy Yan pressed, “He’s family! Surely you’ll try?”

Reluctantly, Gao summoned Lin Qiaoqiao. “Captain Lin, explain today’s major arrest.”

The stage was set for another clash between unyielding justice and corrupt influence—a dance as old as time itself.
