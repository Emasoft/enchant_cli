“Giving you a chance! I’m not leaving—I’ll keep attending class right here. You think you can call people to fight? I’ll wait for you! Got it? Remember—bring as many as you can! I’ll trample you in front of all your so-called brothers! Let them watch! How’s that?”

The sheer arrogance! This was outright humiliation, provocation! The underlings who had come with Jin Xing gritted their teeth in fury. But… what could they do? What options did they have? The man truly possessed the power and capital to back his arrogance. Every word he spoke was true! Who dared step forward to fight? Who dared intervene? Not even a soul dared utter a word of mediation—how could they blame him for mocking them?

Clapping his hands, Guan Yu sneered and jerked his chin at the remaining lackeys. “Carry them away! If you’re still unsatisfied, come back tonight—and remember to bring more people!”

Jin Xing and the slashed underling were silently carried off by their comrades. The corridor was left with only a vast pool of blood staining the floor.

“Ah… you youngsters! Such terrible tempers! Beating people like this—won’t you have to pay compensation? What if they call the police? Even though they came here to cause trouble… your methods are too harsh!” The department head chided halfheartedly, his tone lacking any real severity.

Guan Yu chuckled dismissively. “Compensation? No problem—we’ve got money! Even if a hundred more come, we can afford it! Teachers, you can leave. The four of us will clean up here!”

With a shrug toward Niu Le, Tian Hao, and the others, Guan Yu led them to fetch mops and buckets from the restroom. The department head shook his head repeatedly before departing with the gym teachers. Yet once downstairs, the male teachers clenched their fists in exhilaration.

“Damn! That student—that kid! He’s insane! I love it!”

“Got my blood pumping! Back in my sports school days, I was fierce too! But compared to him? Nothing! Did you see how those bastards didn’t dare breathe a word?”

“Just stood there watching! That was Jin Cheng’s brother? Perfect! After three years of Jin Cheng’s tyranny, someone’s finally here to put him in his place!”

The gym teachers buzzed with excitement. The department head, however, pursed his lips. “This is just the beginning. Don’t forget—the gangs and factions outside haven’t even shown up yet!”

Everyone knew Jin Cheng’s ties to external gangs. The school had tried to curb his collusion with outside troublemakers before, but dealing with underworld forces was a losing battle. Police interventions only brought temporary relief—the thugs would return fiercer than ever, attacking teachers and principals without hesitation. Helpless, the school had capitulated to Jin Cheng’s family’s wealth and influence, tolerating his antics as long as they didn’t escalate.

Sighing, the department head hurried to the principal’s office to report. He knew better than anyone how the principal had secretly negotiated with Jin Cheng to minimize chaos—a key reason for the bully’s unchecked arrogance.

**Chapter 253: The Brothers Have Arrived**

Knocking softly, the department head entered the principal’s office. “Principal Wang, it’s handled,” he said with a deferential bow.

The elderly man who had interviewed Guan Yu sipped tea while browsing a foot fetish forum. Without closing the tab, he motioned for the visitor to sit. After a lingering glance at sheer stockings, he cleared his throat. “Well? How?”

“They… retreated.”

“Retreated?”

“Yes. Driven off by those troublesome freshmen.” The department head recounted the scene with growing animation.

The principal gaped in disbelief. “Such talent among our freshmen? Names?”

“Guan Yu, Niu Le…”

“Guan Yu!” The principal slapped his thigh. “I remember! The hothead from Teacher Liu’s family—the one who nearly fought Teacher Zhang during interviews! I knew he had fire, but this?”

“But Principal, tonight… they might return in force. If Guan Yu provokes a larger conflict—”

“Have the gym teachers monitor the situation. If it escalates, call the police.”

After the department head left, the principal sipped tea, smirking—whether at stockings or the prospect of a new campus rebel, none could say.

By 3 PM, no disturbances had occurred. “Boss, will they come?” Niu Le whispered.

Guan Yu frowned. “After such humiliation? Unlikely they’ll back down.”

Niu Le scouted outside and rushed back. “Boss! Seven or eight cars and vans—dozens gathered at the gates!”

Guan Yu smirked. Predictable. Jin Cheng’s brother, humiliated, sought greater numbers to save face. Dialing Luo Cheng, he ordered: “Mobilize everyone. Seventy-plus men? Good. Hold position.”

Next, he called Feng Xin. Before he could specify numbers, she hung up after a terse “Wait!”

Emerging from classrooms, Guan Yu’s phone rang again. “Boss, seventy brothers here. Need more?”

“Hold.” Guan Yu surveyed the brewing storm. With Luo Cheng’s Flying Motorcycle Gang and Feng Xin’s Fire Gang reinforcements, plus unexpected allies from rival factions drawn by the commotion, the entire Nanjing underworld began converging—a tectonic shift sparked by one student’s defiance.

**Chapter 254: Backing Me Up**

Meanwhile, the Jin brothers sat bandaged in an Audi, glaring at the school gates. “Father mobilized allies from L City. These aren’t local small fries—real players. No way we lose,” Jin Xing rasped through his broken nose.

Their father, Jin Xucheng, had promised unlimited support short of murder. With borrowed gangsters and their own lackeys, fifty-strong forces amassed—enough to flatten the school itself.

Unbeknownst to them, four major syndicates and even the hesitant Liu Gang now raced to Guan Yu’s aid. By sunset, what began as a schoolyard clash would erupt into a legendary showdown—the kind that reshaped cities.
