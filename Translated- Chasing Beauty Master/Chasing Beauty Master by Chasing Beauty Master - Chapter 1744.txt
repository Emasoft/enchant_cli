“You want to buy camels from the Ha Clan?” Xiaomei wore a vexed expression as she continued, “From what I recall, the Ha Clan’s camels aren’t particularly good. And their prices certainly won’t be cheap. How much silver are you planning to spend?”

Guanyu tactfully changed his approach. “Oh? The Ha Clan’s camels are poor? Considering all the help I’ve given them and my good relationship with their elder, I doubt they’d overcharge me.”

“But silver is the last thing I lack. If they’re willing to sell, I’ll dare to buy.” Guanyu shot Xiaomei a meaningful glance.

“Think about it—the Ha Clan members are all strongmen weighing hundreds of pounds each,” Xiaomei argued. “Their camels become exhausted after being ridden by those brutes, resulting in inferior quality. I wouldn’t recommend wasting your silver.”

Guanyu hadn’t expected Xiaomei to badmouth others behind their backs, yet her logic held merit. The Ha Clan’s wrestlers, with their immense weight, could barely ride camels. Even their other strongmen often overworked the beasts until they collapsed in the sand.

“Is that so?” Guanyu feigned sudden understanding. “If matters stand as you say, then Ha Clan camels truly aren’t worth buying. But we can’t have my martial brothers trekking on foot. If necessary, I’ll approach the Bulu Clan instead. Their camels should suffice.”

“After our previous conflict with the Bulu Clan, I’ve since aided them extensively and maintained good relations with their chief. I’m certain he’ll sell to me,” Guanyu asserted.

“The Bulu Clan likely has none left!” Xiaomei interjected hastily. “They were nearly wiped out by me earlier. Their camels were practically eradicated—there’s no way they could provide the numbers you need.”

Guanyu pretended to scratch his head. “This complicates matters. The Ha Clan’s stock is undesirable, the Bulu Clan insufficient. Must we truly proceed on foot? Ah, now I understand the frustration of having silver but nowhere to spend it.”

“Seeing your predicament, perhaps I’ll help after all.” Xiaomei’s tone turned calculated. “State your price. I’ll check with the Jiayi Cult—we might actually have the camels you need.” This was pure pretense, as the cult possessed dozens of camels.

“Oh? Didn’t you claim the Jiayi Cult lacked sufficient camels earlier?” Guanyu eyed her disdainfully. “When I sought to borrow, you refused. Now you offer to sell? Such duplicity won’t win you friends.”

“You accuse me of stinginess?” Xiaomei retorted indignantly. “Our camels weren’t acquired freely. With so many cult members relying on them, I couldn’t possibly lend them out. But if you’re buying with silver, I might sell and later dispatch disciples to replenish our stock.”

As they negotiated, the eastern sun rose higher, bathing the cloudless sky in radiant light. The splendid weather seemed to lift everyone’s spirits.

Guanyu recognized the inevitable—he’d need to purchase from Xiaomei after all. He’d never truly intended to seek alternatives, knowing the Jiayi Cult possessed the required camels.

“Very well. If your cult has camels available, purchasing from you suits our partnership. As collaborators, you’ll surely offer fair pricing. What’s your rate per camel?” Guanyu’s smile turned businesslike, aware of pressing matters awaiting attention.

Chapter 4562: Suffering Losses

Xiaomei calculated swiftly. Guanyu had boasted limitless silver—this was her chance for substantial profit. His effortless production of a hundred taels earlier confirmed his wealth.

“Considering our partnership, I’ll not overcharge. One hundred taels per camel.” Her nonchalant delivery couldn’t mask the exorbitance—over a thousand taels for a dozen camels.

“One hundred? You might as well rob me!” Guanyu scoffed. “Elsewhere, this sum buys three camels. Your blatant exploitation insults our collaboration.”

“Exorbitant? Hardly.” Xiaomei countered, “Outsiders don’t face desert conditions. Here, camel feed must be purchased externally at great expense.”

“Even accounting for desert hardships, a hundred taels is outrageous!” Guanyu’s lips twisted. “Is this how partners treat each other? Search your serpentine conscience—does a camel truly warrant such cost?”

Xiaomei lowered her head, recognizing her overreach yet unwilling to relinquish this lucrative opportunity. “Our camels are desert-bred elites, meticulously tended. Doesn’t that merit premium pricing?”

“Keep your ‘elites’ then. We’ll inspect the Bulu Clan’s stock.” Guanyu feigned impatience, turning away.

“Eighty taels!” Xiaomei blurted. “A twenty-tael discount for collaboration and our shared goal of finding Miao City. This is my final offer.”

The price remained astronomical, but Xiaomei pressed further: “You claimed endless silver reserves earlier. Why quibble now?”

“Abundance doesn’t equate to foolish waste,” Guanyu retorted, his smile vanishing. “Eighty remains unacceptable.”

“The stinginess is yours, not mine!” Reading Guanyu’s resolve, Xiaomei conceded: “Name your price then.”

Guanyu pounced: “Standard rate is twenty taels. I’ll offer thirty—more than fair.”

“Too low!” Xiaomei feigned shock, though thirty aligned precisely with profitable margins. “Fifty taels minimum. Lower and I incur losses.”

Guanyu assessed their broader needs—clothing, provisions, gear. “Fifty per camel accepted, but you must include supplementary supplies.”

“Deal!” Xiaomei brightened. “Necessities will be provided. We’ll finalize details at the cult.”

Chapter 4563: Double the Price

Xiaomei inwardly rejoiced—eight hundred taels for sixteen camels, an unprecedented windfall enabling cult expansion.

Guanyu nodded. “Settled. At the cult, my brothers require proper rest before proceeding.”

“Accommodations abound. Let’s depart immediately.” Xiaomei practically glowed, envisioning her newfound wealth.

Guanyu harbored unspoken plans—having paid premium prices, he intended to claim additional resources at the cult. But such intentions remained veiled for now.

Under revitalizing sunshine, the group prepared to depart. Wang Jun approached Guanyu suspiciously: “You paid silver, didn’t you? Xiaomei’s no philanthropist.”

Guanyu sighed. “A steep price indeed—fifty taels per camel.”

“Fifty?!” Wang Jun exclaimed. “That’s double market rate! Have you lost reason? Eight hundred taels for transport?”

“Alternatives?” Guanyu countered. “Trekking in wooden sandals? The Ha Clan’s garments don’t fit us. The Bulu Clan barely survives post-catastrophe. Our collaboration with Xiaomei requires maintaining her goodwill.”

Wang Jun grudgingly acknowledged the strategy. “Clever—using overpayment as leverage for other supplies.”

“Precisely,” Guanyu affirmed. “At the cult, we’ll secure tents, proper attire, provisions—all essentials Xiaomei can provide. Consider the camel cost inclusive of these necessities.”

Wang Jun nodded, impressed by Guanyu’s foresight. “But can we trust that serpentine miser?”

“Once silver changes hands, she’ll comply,” Guanyu assured. “Our priority remains fully equipping the group for the journey ahead.”

Chapter 4564: Great Distance

“Your wealth, your decision,” Wang Jun conceded. “But remember—our funds dwindle after this expenditure.”

Guanyu surveyed the regrouping party. “Let’s move. The cult’s resources await.”

As they departed, the desert’s rare temperate humidity eased their fatigue. Guanyu addressed the group: “This fine weather blesses our departure. At the Jiayi Cult, proper mounts and rest await.”

The promise of camels lifted spirits, though Wang Jun noted lingering concerns. Xiaomei’s notorious avarice made smooth transactions doubtful. Yet Guanyu’s strategic concessions suggested hidden depths to their agreement.

The caravan moved eastward, footprints fading in damp sand, their fates intertwined with silver promises and serpentine cunning beneath the desert’s watchful sun.
