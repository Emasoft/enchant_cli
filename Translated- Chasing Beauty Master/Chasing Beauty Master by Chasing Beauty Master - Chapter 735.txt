“Master Yang, you are too modest. I saved you not out of greed for your family’s wealth, but simply to help someone in need. Having gained someone as radiant as Conghan (From the Cold) is already the finest reward I could ask for.”

Guan Yu’s words deeply moved Yang Conghan. Her beautiful, glistening eyes gazed at him with tenderness. She had assumed Guan Yu would accept the substantial offer of half the Yang family’s shares, yet he refused. Could it truly be for her sake? Meeting such a man in this lifetime—even if he hadn’t saved her father, Yang Cheng—Yang Conghan felt she might still have chosen to follow him.

At noon, the Yang family prepared another lavish feast to honor Guan Yu, after which he bid them farewell.

Lan Yu called, “Guan Yu, I’m treating my sisters to dinner tonight. Are you free?” Guan Yu was surprised by her uncharacteristically polite tone. Another gathering with her friends? Such events held little appeal. “I’d rather not. Enjoy yourselves.”

Unexpectedly, Lan Yu’s fiery temper flared. “No! You *have* to come! I need to show you off today. If you refuse, I’ll pester you nonstop from now on!”

Resigned to securing future peace, Guan Yu reluctantly agreed.

That evening, Guan Yu drove his luxury car to the Royal Garden Grand Hotel—A City’s largest and most opulent establishment. As they pulled up, two impeccably dressed attendants rushed to open their doors, bowing respectfully. The parking lot brimmed with high-end vehicles; modest cars were nowhere in sight.

“Sir, may I park your car in the basement and deliver the keys to your private room?” one attendant offered politely.

Guan Yu nodded, impressed by the service. “Pink Room on the third floor,” Lan Yu declared.

Inside the Pink Room, seven or eight young women—all around eighteen—chattered boisterously. Their vibrant hair colors could rival paint palettes, and their outfits adhered to the principles of “sheer,” “revealing,” “skimpy,” and “scant.”

“Why’s Lan Yu treating us? What’s the occasion?”
“Rumor says she snagged some hotshot!”

The girls laughed uproariously, their tight tops straining against ample curves.

The door swung open. Silence fell as Guan Yu entered with Lan Yu clinging to his arm. Every eye locked onto him. These women knew Lan Yu’s notorious temper had driven away countless suitors. Seeing her now, docile as a kitten, left them stunned.

The man before them possessed an understated handsomeness—neither conventionally “hot” nor classically striking, yet flawlessly proportioned. His keen eyes swept the room, radiating quiet confidence.

Two girls recognized him. “Isn’t that the guy who humiliated Young Master Ran online?”
“Yeah! In that viral video, he had another woman on his arm. How’d Lan Yu tame him?”

Clearly, footage of Ran’s embarrassment—featuring Guan Yu and Liu Hongshuang—had spread widely. *I’ll need to have those posts taken down later,* Guan Yu noted mentally.

Lan Yu snapped her fingers. “Listen up! This is my boyfriend. Well, more like I’m *his* gift. You’re right—he’s got plenty of beauties around. Details later!”

“A gift? And he keeps a harem?”
“Bet he’s got stamina for all-night marathons!”

The girls’ bold banter made Xue Jing’s friends seem demure by comparison. Even the shy ones’ eyes sparkled with unspoken thoughts.

“Enough!” Lan Yu flushed. “I’m still a virgin! How would I know his… capabilities? Maybe I *should* test him soon.”

“Let us trial-run him for you!”

“Back off!” Lan Yu dragged Guan Yu to the massive round table. Having survived Xue Jing’s gathering, Guan Yu remained unfazed—though his eyes appreciated the floral spectacle.

“What’s hottie’s name?”
“Lan Yu’s ‘big treasure’ must have big… *strengths*.” A girl leered downward.

Guan Yu winced. These girls outdid Xue Jing’s crew in audacity. “Since Lan Yu’s your elder, call me brother-in-law.”

“Pfft! You might be younger! Not sure about *other* measurements…”

“Behave!” Lan Yu hissed. “You’ll scare him off!”
“Wow! First time Lan Yu defends a man!”

Guan Yu leaned into their game. “However young, I’m still your sister’s man. So many bold ‘sisters-in-law’ tonight—quite the haul.”

Matching their boldness with his own prevented the awkwardness of Xue Jing’s party. Why feign modesty when openness suited everyone?

The feast unfolded—a spread worth thousands, funded by the Hua Yu Group’s support. As a waitress returned Guan Yu’s keys, the group descended into raucous drinking games. Post-dinner, they migrated to Mac’s Bar.

Familiar neon lights pulsed over the thumping bass. Guan Yu entered flanked by his floral entourage, drawing stares. They claimed a red circular booth, where the girls resumed rowdy dice games.

At the bar, two striking women caught Guan Yu’s eye—a Westerner with exotic features and two local girls in microscopic skirts. The latter’s intimacy suggested more than friendship.

One girl noticed Guan Yu. “Guan Yu? Surrounded by beauties again?” She toasted him slyly. He reciprocated with a white-toothed grin.

Trouble arrived as six tattooed thugs stalked in. Their leader, Daquan—a hulking brute—zeroed in on the bar girls. “Damn! Prime meat tonight!”

“Let’s drag ’em out! Everyone gets a turn!”

The gang surrounded their targets. “Get lost!” a girl snapped.

Daquan sneered. “Lucky night for you bitches. You’re coming with us.” His men grabbed the screaming girls. Patrons looked away—no one challenged these street lords.

*Crash!* A bottle shattered over Daquan’s skull. Guan Yu dropped three thugs with precise strikes, shielding the girls. Music died as all eyes turned.

“Wow! Lan Yu, your man’s a kung fu master!”
“Hero saving beauties! Maybe I’ll get kidnapped next!”

Lan Yu preened. “Of course! Only a real man could handle me.”

The rescued girls clung to Guan Yu. “Thank you! These pigs were disgusting!”

Though Guan Yu didn’t recall them, he played along. “Are you hurt?”

Lan Yu’s friends noted the familiarity. Jealousy prickled—how many beauties *did* he know?

Facing the thugs, Guan Yu said coolly, “Leave. Now.”

Daquan rose, blood streaming down his face. “You’re dead, bastard!” A henchman brandished a dagger.

Gasps erupted as the blade thrust toward Guan Yu’s chest. He caught the wrist, twisted—the dagger clattered down. A kick to the groin sent the man crumpling.

“Who’s next?” Guan Yu eyed the remaining thugs. Silence answered.

Lan Yu’s voice rang out: “Told you! Six? Sixty wouldn’t faze him!”
“Damn! No wonder you’re stuck on him, sis!”

The bar erupted in applause. Guan Yu’s rescued companions whispered thanks, but Lan Yu’s possessive grip tightened. Tonight’s drama was far from over.
