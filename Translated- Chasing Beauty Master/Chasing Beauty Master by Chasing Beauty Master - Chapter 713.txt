“Are you all out of your minds? One is his wife, another his girlfriend—how shameless! Well I’m his mistress!” Lan Yu spoke without restraint, voicing whatever came to mind.

Amei watched nearby, knowing she couldn’t wait any longer. If she delayed further, her chance would vanish. Stepping forward, she said to Guan Yu, “Guan Yu, may I invite you to dinner? Do you have time?”

“Oh heavens, my heart is breaking! Our superstar is actually humbling herself to ask him out! My dear Amei, if it were me, I’d pluck the moon from the sky for her!” Classmate A wailed dramatically.

“Go pluck that moon first before spouting nonsense, idiot,” Classmate B retorted.

Xue Jing hurriedly interjected, “Amei, why are you adding to this mess? Isn’t this chaotic enough already?”

Amei brightened. “Xue Jing, you remember me? Guan Yu has amnesia—quick, tell him we know each other!”

“I’ve already told him! Let’s not dwell on that now. Hurry and drive this woman away!” Xue Jing pointed at Lan Yu, who realized her opponents were multiplying, tilting the situation against her.

Lan Yu’s beautiful eyes darted cunningly as she declared, “Guan Yu, our child is over three months old now. He misses his father. How can you be so heartless, abandoning us?” She gently caressed her flat abdomen. As for how she knew Guan Yu’s name—obviously overheard earlier, you fools.

The moment Lan Yu finished speaking, the atmosphere shifted violently. Murderous glares from Xue Jing, Lü Mei, Amei, and even Pan Xiaoxia pierced through Guan Yu. Four stunning beauties awaited his response. Guan Yu knew one wrong move could spell his doom under such lethal scrutiny.

Xue Jing pinched Guan Yu’s back. “Explain this situation! If it’s true, I’ll make you kneel on motherboard shards at home! Getting some girl pregnant—the sisters will skin you alive!”

Guan Yu sighed helplessly. “Stop this nonsense. I’ve only met you once, and that was in the middle of the road. How could you possibly be carrying my child?”

Lan Yu feigned tenderness. “Why not? Even one encounter can lead to pregnancy. Love can happen anywhere—even roadside.”

Like a thunderclap, Guan Yu surrendered completely.

Xue Jing’s pinching intensified. “Tell me the truth! Is this real?” Lü Mei watched anxiously. “Sister Jing, don’t be angry yet. Let’s clarify things first. Don’t hurt him.”

**Chapter 1811: Playing Tricks**

Lan Yu continued her act: “Why impossible? A single encounter suffices. Roadside romance works too.”

Guan Yu was utterly defeated.

Xue Jing’s nails dug deeper. “Explain yourself!” Lü Mei intervened gently, “Please calm down first.”

Lü Mei instinctively protected Guan Yu. Turning to Lan Yu, she snapped, “Shameless vixen! Our Guan Yu would never act recklessly. I trust his character completely!”

“Well said! Lü Mei understands me.” Guan Yu chuckled.

Lan Yu countered, “His character? With so many beauties fighting over him? Even that woman in the car!” She pointed at Pan Xiaoxia.

Lü Mei retorted, “We’re all sisters here. Who are you, appearing from nowhere? After Guan Yu’s wealth?”

“You’re the intruders! Should my child be born fatherless?” Lan Yu suddenly burst into theatrical tears.

Guan Yu’s head spun. Among these beauties, only gentle Amei reasoned, “Guan Yu, if she truly carries your child, you must take responsibility.”

“Amei, don’t believe her lies!” Guan Yu warned.

Seizing the moment, Lan Yu stumbled dramatically, clutching her stomach. “The pain! My baby—I’m losing it!”

Chaos erupted. Xue Jing urged, “Take her to the hospital! If anything happens to your child—”

Bewildered, Guan Yu carried Lan Yu to her Hummer. As he drove, Lan Yu secretly smiled.

“The pain worsens! Carry me,” she cooed. Guan Yu reluctantly princess-carried her into the vehicle.

En route, Lan Yu kept groaning until Guan Yu pulled over. “Enough! My sisters will punish me severely for this pregnancy farce!”

Lan Yu grinned. “Needed dramatic exit strategy with all those rivals. Just wanted to thank you properly.”

Alone now, Guan Yu noticed Lan Yu’s crimson miniskirt barely concealing her lingerie, her legs provocatively positioned. Swallowing hard, he asked, “Why bring me here?”

“For fun. To thank you.” She parted her legs wider, delighting in his reaction.

“What kind of fun?” Guan Yu rasped.

“Any kind you want,” Lan Yu purred.

Guan Yu suddenly remembered Pan Xiaoxia’s treatment. “No time for games! You’ve ruined important business!”

Meanwhile, Lü Mei pouted. “Impregnating some floozy—how disgraceful.”

Amei suggested, “Let’s all dine together.” The group agreed, piling into Pan Xiaoxia’s car headed for Mike’s Bar—where Xue Jing planned to “find handsome guys to spite Guan Yu.”

**Chapter 1812: The Brother-in-Law**

At Mike’s Bar, Guan Yu encountered the group again. “Coordinated ambush?” Lan Yu glared.

Amei asked concernedly, “Is your baby alright?”

“Hospital fixed everything. Doctor says I need paternal care,” Lan Yu teased.

Xue Jing huffed, “Came to find hot guys, but you pests followed.”

As they entered the VIP lounge, He Chuan appeared with hundred-strong mob. “Amei! Why choose this bastard over me?”

Guan Yu threatened, “Want six months in hospital?”

Amei gently refused He Chuan while Xue Jing ridiculed his aged appearance. Enraged, He Chuan summoned thugs.

“Today I’ll rape your women before your eyes!” He Chuan sneered.

Guan Yu’s aura intensified. “Retract your words, or this day becomes your death anniversary.”

Xue Jing warned He Chuan to apologize, but insults continued. Guan Yu lunged, intercepted by hidden异能者 (supernaturals). Overcoming them, he grabbed He Chuan’s throat.

“APOLOGIZE!” Guan Yu roared, smashing He Chuan’s nose twice.

The bar’s second-in-command intervened: “Spare him! He’s my brother-in-law!”

Guan Yu discarded the unconscious bully. “Never appear before me again.”

Lan Yu watched adoringly. Such protective masculinity!

**Chapter 1813: Blind Fools**

The second-in-command begged mercy. “He’s family! I’ll reform him!”

Guan Yu seethed. “Such scum deserves death.”

Xue Jing mediated while the mob dispersed. In the aftermath, Guan Yu’s group dominated the bar’s attention—a godlike entourage of beauties and lethal charm.

He Chuan’s battered form was dragged away as the music resumed. Guan Yu’s legend grew—the man who tamed supernaturals and humiliated armies for his women’s honor. Lan Yu nestled closer, already plotting her next move in this romantic battlefield.
