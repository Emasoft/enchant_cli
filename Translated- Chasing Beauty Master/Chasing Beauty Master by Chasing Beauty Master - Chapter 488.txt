Kelly shook her head in refusal. Roxie, constrained by Kelly's presence, also waved her hand dismissively. Only Amy sitting beside Guan Yu remained - the young elf girl stared fixedly the roasted meat, something her kind had never tasted before!

“Little one, just say if you want some! Big brother will feed you!”

Seeing Guan Yu's mischievous grin, Amy's face flushed crimson. “I won't eat it! Our elf tribe doesn't consume meat... though... it does look delicious.”

“Of course! This is mortal realm delicacy!” Guan Yu declared before biting into the mole's rump with an audible crunch, rich flavors bursting on his tongue.

“Ah! Dragon Clan brother is so mean! Eating so temptingly on purpose! Hmph! I won't play with you!” Amy pouted, pounding Guan Yu's thighs with delicate fists. Rather than pain, the assault brought tingling pleasure, making Guan Yu impulsively embrace the girl.

Watching this, Roxie coughed pointedly. “Ahem! Amy, stop fooling around! We travel tomorrow - rest now!”

Chastised, Amy snatched a roasted mole from Guan Yu and scampered to the Blue Moon Demon Wolf. “Poor wolfie, you must be starving! Have some meat!”

The salivating wolf nearly wept. “Goddess! Truly my divine benefactor!” It swallowed the mole whole, then bowed dog-like, rubbing against Amy's petite frame contentedly.

Guan Yu scowled. “Perverted mutt! Count three - stop or become roasted wolf meat!”

The wolf instantly froze, making the girls giggle.

“What fine revelry you have here!”

A gruff voice echoed from darkness. Roxie and Kelly sprang up alertly as Guan Yu shouted, “Show yourself if you dare!”

Rustling followed as four figures emerged - a handsome youth, plainly-dressed middle-aged man, and two burly escorts carrying large packs. The pale-faced youth stood out most.

The man bowed courteously. “Peace, travelers. We're common folk needing to traverse this forest by night. May we share your camp?”

Roxie challenged, “How know we you're not brigands?”

“Old bones like mine harm none. Stay or go as you please.” The man turned to leave.

“Halt!” Guan Yu circled the man appraisingly. “Stay if you will.”

Roxie pulled Guan Yu aside. “Dragon Clan brother! What if they're dangerous?”

Guan Yu whispered, “If malicious, they'd stalk us regardless. Better keep close.” His lips brushed her ear. “Fear not - I'll protect you.”

The youth coughed angrily. “Uncle! They mock us! Let's depart!”

“Tsk! Young yet quick-tempered.” Guan Yu taunted. “Petty hearts shorten lifespans, boy!”

As the youth bristled, the mediator intervened. “Wise words. A-San, A-Si, seat the young master.” The escorts complied.

“I'm Mu Feng. How shall we address you?”

“Call me Lord Guan!” He lazily bit into another mole.

Mu Feng smiled. “Then Master Guan it is.”

Guan Yu grew suspicious of this unflappable negotiator. Better an angry opponent than smiling enigma.

"Patriarch!" A faint voice resonated in Guan Yu's mind - his awakened companion, Jin Gang.

"Finally awake! Help me assess..."

"Already done," Jin Gang interrupted. "They're no commoners - likely nobles or sect elders. The man and invalid youth are Advanced Sword Masters. Escorts are Junior Sword Masters."

Guan Yu's gut tightened. "Equivalent to Nascent Soul stage? Two Advanced Sword Masters against my single Nascent Soul cultivation... risky."

"Treasure hunters, I'd wager," Jin Gang added.

Approached by curious Amy, Guan Yu diverted her. “Sleep, little elf. I'll guard you.”

As Amy drowsed on his lap, Guan Yu confronted Mu Feng. “I know your true purpose!”

The man's eyelid twitched. An escort whispered, “Elder Tian, could he know about the Crystal Toad...” Elder Tian silenced him with a palm strike.

“Jests aside,” Elder Tian chuckled nervously, “we rest now.”

Guan Yu abruptly roused his party. “We depart!”

Under night's cover, they overheard the conspirators. “Crystal Toad!” The words electrified Guan Yu and Kelly.

Dawn found them nearing Elven Forest's entrance - a spectacular twin-peaked pass. Emerging through the stone corridor, Guan Yu gaped at the miracle before them - towering trees glowing with bioluminescence, crystalline streams weaving through floating gardens. The Elven Sanctuary defied mortal imagination.

“Past these mountains lies our home,” Roxie sighed wearily. Even the magical scenery couldn't outweigh their exhaustion.

As they crossed the threshold, none noticed the faint crystal resonance from Guan Yu's pouch - the same harmonic vibration reported near Crystal Toad habitats. The real adventure was just beginning.
