Now was Guan Yu’s chance to deploy his shield. He glared coldly at the figure standing at the entrance. Typically, assassins were of smaller stature, but this time, a hulking man blocked the doorway.

The man made no effort to conceal his features. Guan Yu immediately recognized him as a Westerner, around forty years old. If the Feng Family had hired this assassin, their response was alarmingly swift.

The café was in chaos. Though daytime patrons were few, the scattered customers had all cowered in corners. Guan Yu motioned for Wang Jun to retreat further, lest she be caught in the crossfire.

The giant at the door gave Guan Yu no time to hesitate. Despite his towering frame—a full head taller than Guan Yu—he moved with startling agility. His thick arms, as stout as Wang Jun’s thighs, wielded a gleaming silver dagger that flashed toward Guan Yu in an instant. Guan Yu sensed the attack’s lethality; even in daylight, the blade radiated a dazzling aura of energy.

Drawing his military spike, Guan Yu attempted to parry, but the dagger shifted trajectories mid-air. By the time it neared his chest, its intended target had become unpredictable.

The energy-charged dagger struck Guan Yu’s shield. Though it didn’t pierce his flesh, the impact hurled him backward. He crashed to the floor, chest tight and breath ragged. Without the shield’s protection, that single blow would have been fatal. *At least a First-Class Zun*, Guan Yu thought, shaken.

The assassin’s eyes widened in surprise. His strike, capable of shattering stone, had been repelled by a milky-white barrier.

**Chapter 2143: A Perilous Moment**

The energy-charged dagger struck Guan Yu’s shield. Though it didn’t pierce his flesh, the impact hurled him backward. He crashed to the floor, chest tight and breath ragged. Without the shield’s protection, that single blow would have been fatal. *At least a First-Class Zun*, Guan Yu thought, shaken.

The assassin’s eyes widened in surprise. His strike, capable of shattering stone, had been repelled by a milky-white barrier.

But the man’s astonishment vanished as swiftly as it appeared. Before Guan Yu could steady himself, another attack descended—not a stab, but a sweeping slash.

The dagger in the assassin’s hand seemed to morph into a two-meter-long blade. Gripping it with both hands, he brought it down in a devastating arc. Guan Yu realized the weapon remained a dagger, but its energy extension mimicked a Japanese warblade. The assassin’s oppressive aura engulfed the café, locking onto Guan Yu’s every movement. Escape was impossible; this strike would land regardless of evasion.

Patrons huddled in corners, faces pale with terror. Wang Jun bit her lip, helpless. Her mediocre combat skills were useless against such a foe.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu abandoned defense. His shield transitioned from pale yellow to milky-white. Discarding his spike, he formed rapid hand seals. Two seconds later, the energy blade collided with his shield—shattering it instantly.

Wang Jun screamed, shielding her eyes. A deafening explosion rocked the room, forcing everyone to duck.

When the dust settled, Guan Yu stood unharmed. The assassin, however, was blasted through the shattered doorway, skidding three meters outside. Blood trickled from his lips.

Moments later, the crowd surged toward Guan Yu. “Are you alright?!” they clamored.

Guan Yu opened his mouth—only to vomit blood, narrowly missing Wang Jun. Coughing violently, he slumped into a chair. A quick internal scan revealed the damage. “I’ll live,” he rasped.

His head throbbed oddly. Though unscathed externally, the pain puzzled him. Had the phantom blade struck his mind?

The assassin had fled, likely too injured to continue. Guan Yu, drained of strength, turned to Wang Jun. “Take me back to Qiaoyuan District.”

Nodding, Wang Jun supported him like a devoted aide. Only Guan Yu understood the gamble he’d taken: detonating his shield at the precise moment of impact to reflect the damage. The assassin, unprepared for such a tactic, had borne the brunt of his own assault.

Yet the backlash had rattled Guan Yu’s dantian, hence the blood. Fortunately, his injuries weren’t critical.

En route, Guan Yu asked, “Could the Fengs have sent him?”

“Unlikely,” Wang Jun replied.

Guan Yu agreed. Daylight assassination in a public café? The attacker’s ferocity suggested personal vengeance. Then it struck him—*Ma Hai*. The Westerner he’d killed alongside Jones. This man might be seeking retribution.

**Chapter 2144: Two Days and Nights**

Upon returning to Qiaoyuan District, Wang Jun tactfully excused herself. Xue Jing fretted over Guan Yu, lamenting her neglect. A-Mei, upon seeing his state, burst into tears.

Now surrounded by five women—Xue Jing, A-Mei, Lü Mei, Zhang Han, and Lan Yu (Blue Jade)—Guan Yu’s headache worsened. “I’m not dying, A-Mei. Stop crying,” he groaned.

A-Mei’s sobs subsided into hiccups, her eyes swollen. Lü Mei paced anxiously, while Zhang Han nibbled shrimp crackers, occasionally offering one to Guan Yu.

“Let me rest,” Guan Yu insisted, shooing them out. Exhausted and injured, he collapsed into bed.

His internal injuries required self-healing. Alone, he reflected on their concern—touching, yet overwhelming. A-Mei’s distress pained him most.

He awoke at 7 PM, assuming he’d napped briefly. But Xue Jing’s grave expression told otherwise. “You’ve slept two days and nights.”

A-Mei’s tears resumed. “We’ve been so worried!”

Guan Yu blinked. His dantian had largely recovered, his strength returning. The women, however, were shadows of themselves—pale, red-eyed, and exhausted. Zhang Han snored beside him, having claimed his bed.

After devouring a meal of chicken bone soup prepared by A-Mei, Guan Yu urged them to rest. Xue Jing hesitated, eyeing Zhang Han.

“Let her sleep,” Guan Yu said, smiling at the girl’s adorable snores.

**Chapter 2145: Recruiting Experts**

A-Mei’s devotion contrasted her fragile nature. Zhang Han, ever the child, had stubbornly stayed despite her weariness.

Once assured of Guan Yu’s recovery, the women dispersed. Xue Jing returned with leftovers, which Guan Yu wolfed down.

Days later, at dawn, Guan Yu practiced in the courtyard. His shield, now translucent ivory, shimmered faintly. *It’ll turn completely invisible one day*, he mused. The self-created defense had evolved remarkably.

Yet challenges loomed. The assassin’s threat lingered, and Guan Yu’s harem—five women with clashing temperaments—demanded careful navigation. Survival required not just strength, but wisdom.
