Standing behind twelve figures, Sakurako slowly turned around, drawing a silk handkerchief from her waist to gently polish her flexible sword. Three meters before her, a middle-aged man clad entirely in black glared with venomous eyes. "Takagi Sakurako (Cherry Blossom Child), heiress of Takagi Communications Group," he spat. "You dare maim twelve top assassins of Watanabe Corporation in one stroke? Even your father wouldn't presume this matter ends here!"

Sakurako refused to dignify him with a glance, continuing to wipe her blade with contemptuous deliberation. "Matsushita Masazumi," she sneered. "You're merely an upgraded First-Class Mutant. Though you may intimidate others, Takagi Sakurako fears no one! The conclusion of this affair isn't yours to decree. I demand to know – what madness possesses Watanabe Corporation to stalk me and cause disturbance at Mr. Ono's sushi establishment? Have you forgotten the lesson of thirty years past? Should Mr. Ono's wrath awaken, could your wretched syndicate withstand it?"

Even as a First-Class Mutant, Matsushita Masazumi exhibited palpable trepidation at the mention of Mr. Ono – fear extending beyond mere power dynamics into deeper, unspoken realms. "We'd never presume discourtesy toward Mr. Ono," he countered, shaking his head. "Yet even his favor cannot absolve your crippling of twelve elite operatives. This debt must be settled. Should Watanabe Corporation swallow such humiliation, our existence in the Eastern Isles becomes meaningless."

Sakurako's supple blade shimmered like quicksilver beneath streetlamps, its tip leveled at Masazumi's throat. "If accounts must be balanced," she challenged, "let us first discuss why Watanabe dogs trailed my steps. Lying in ambush here – was kidnapping your intent?"

Chapter 1715: Upgraded Mutants

Regardless of global opinions toward the Eastern Isles, none could deny this nation's scientific prowess remained at civilization's forefront. Guan Yu had always believed phenomena like Mutants defied scientific explanation or replication. Yet since his return, he'd first encountered pseudo-psychics created through serum injections, and now heard of "Upgraded Mutants" from Sakurako's lips.

Earlier, while sensing Masazumi and two others in the vehicle as First-Class Mutants, Guan Yu had focused on Sakurako's duel with the assassins, neglecting deeper scrutiny. Now he realized Masazumi's imposing aura belied true strength barely surpassing Third-Class Mutants – inferior even to Second-Class.

Consider this: all of China boasted only three authentic First-Class Mutants. Were Watanabe Corporation to possess three genuine First-Class, the implications would be terrifying.

Yet witnessing Sakurako's fearless confrontation, Guan Yu reassessed the young woman. Domestically, Wang Manqing's abilities rivaled Third-Class Mutants through family-enhancement methods. Could Sakurako employ similar techniques?

Eastern Isle women typically projected delicate fragility. Though a police officer, Sakurako's model-like physique and features defied expectations – who could imagine this porcelain doll disabling twelve assassins in eyeblinks, then facing globally feared Mutants without flinching?

"Kidnap you? No, no, Miss Sakurako, you misunderstand," Masazumi's gaze shifted venomously to Guan Yu. "Our operation targets the Chinese man behind you. Three Watanabe members died this afternoon – reports place you both at the scene. Our chairman wishes to meet this... Guan Yunchang, correct?" His tone hardened. "However, having injured our men, you'll both accompany us to headquarters."

Though uncertain of Guan Yu's capabilities, Sakurako recalled Mr. Ono's deference toward him. Facing only Masazumi, their combined strength might prevail. She subtly gestured behind her back, signaling coordinated attack.

Guan Yu knew Sakurako might survive solo combat but couldn't defeat Masazumi. With two additional Mutants in the vehicle – each Masazumi's equal – escaping undetected would require exposing Second-Class Mutant strength, jeopardizing his concealed identity.

As Masazumi's peripheral vision tracked Sakurako's blade, her shoulder twitch betrayed impending assault. A sharp whistle pierced the air. "Move a muscle," roared a voice, "and be vaporized!"

Blinding light engulfed Guan Yu and Sakurako, freezing them in its glare. "Three laser cannons have you sighted," rasped a voice Guan Yu recognized from the vehicle. "Comply peacefully – we're merely escorting you headquarters."

Intrigue burned in Guan Yu. Watanabe Corporation possessed not only Mutant-enhancement technology but military-grade laser weaponry – an organization demanding scrutiny.

Despite long-standing international restrictions, particularly on military development, the Eastern Isles hoarded advanced technologies. Though not the nation's strongest syndicate, Watanabe's display of three Mutants and prohibited arms fascinated Guan Yu.

Knowing Sakurako resisted abduction, Guan Yu saw opportunity. "This stems from me," he whispered. "Anti-Chinese sentiment here suspects my identity. Let me clarify their members died in a truck collision – surveillance footage proves it. Accompanying them saves investigation time."

Sakurako recognized their predicament – against laser cannons, resistance meant annihilation. "Very well," she conceded. "I'll protect you, even at cost."

Her words rang hollow – Watanabe's reputation for assassination, kidnapping, and drug trafficking preceded them. Even as Takagi Group heiress, she couldn't guarantee safety.

As they surrendered, metallic clangs heralded a descending cage. Sakurako's sword sparked against indestructible alloy bars. "Conserve energy, Miss Sakurako," the raspy voice advised. "This cage contains Mutants."

Chapter 1716: Watanabe Headquarters

Post thirty-minute journey, the truck halted at a mountain-foot compound. Their cage transferred to a subterranean chamber via hidden elevator. When Masazumi departed after securing them, Sakurako demanded, "I must contact my family!"

"Rest assured," Masazumi sneered. "We'll inform Takagi-san. How will he react learning his daughter maimed Watanabe operatives for a Chinese national? With China's rising power threatening our isles, your fraternization invites military scrutiny. Takagi Group's troubles multiply."

His exit left Sakurako pale, recognizing the truth in his threats. Eastern Isle's relationship with China blended admiration and resentment, recently curdling into Mutant-fueled dread.

Officially, China's twenty-four Mutants ranked second globally, while Eastern Isle's fifteen left them chafing as secondary power. This inferiority complex drove decade-long efforts by top scientists to develop Mutant-neutralizing weapons – precision requirements forcing outsourcing to the Ouyang family under sci-fi merchandise guise. This collaboration doomed the Ouyang clan while enabling Eastern Isle to reduce China's official Mutant count to twenty-one.

Sakurako realized any Chinese association risked military audits crippling Takagi Group. Yet since meeting Guan Yu, their inexplicable resonance overrode national boundaries – he embodied her long-awaited soulmate. Now reality crashed down, fear coiling in her heart.

Noticing her distress, Guan Yu embraced her shoulders. "Fear not – I'll resolve this without compromising you."

"How?" Sakurako despaired. "Your strength – perhaps corporate facade hides ancient martial heritage. But modern Mutants eclipse traditional arts. Here in Eastern Isles, you're powerless. Abandoning you means your death, yet involving my family brings ruin!"

Though acquainted mere hours, their connection felt millennia old. Without romantic declarations, synchrony of spirit bound them.

Guilt surged through Guan Yu. "Sakurako... I'm not Guan Yunchang. I am Guan Yu."

"I know," she sighed. "Mr. Ono recognized you, did you think me blind? Your disguise lacks original handsomeness. Our only hope – they remain ignorant. When cage opens, I'll distract them. Escape before exposure!"

Guan Yu shook his head. "They want us alive. Stay calm – I'll investigate." Golden light shimmered as his consciousness separated from body, vanishing midair.

"Astral projection?" Sakurako gasped, hands covering mouth. Ancient texts described such divine arts – myth made flesh before her eyes.

Chapter 1717: Blackmail

Sakurako's immersion in Chinese culture – nurtured by Mr. Ono – bred disdain for Eastern Isle suitors. Guan Yu's smile and poise embodied her literary ideals, forging day-old devotion. Witnessing his mythical abilities confirmed her choice – no regret would follow this man.

Guan Yu's consciousness drifted through compound layers. The outer courtyard housed brutish low-ranking members carousing – mere thugs. Middle courtyard hosted a dozen calmer, pseudo-psychic mid-level operatives.

The inner sanctum blazed with light, revealing the true power core: three Upgraded First-Class Mutants, plus one genuine First-Class and Second-Class Mutant – staggering force contradicting intelligence reports. Watanabe Corporation's hidden might demanded reevaluation.
