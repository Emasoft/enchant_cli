After exiting Echo Pavilion, Young Master Men and the two Zhao brothers parted ways. Zhao Er-gongzi smiled, “Young Master Men, we have other matters to attend. Let’s meet again when opportunity arises.”

“Very well. Safe travels,” Men replied. As their paths diverged, the Zhao brothers turned left while Men and his retinue retraced their steps toward home.

“Halt!” A sudden shout pierced the night. Men blinked to find two figures materializing before him—a man and woman.

Though the Zhao brothers had already walked some distance, they turned back upon hearing the commotion. Men, the City Lord’s second son accustomed to deference, bristled with drunken indignation. “Good dogs don’t block the path! Scram before this young master!”

His attendants moved to shove the interlopers aside but froze upon seeing their drawn swords. The martial bearing of Yue Jing and Lai Lixia from Crimson Lotus Sect became apparent. Their eyes locked onto the jade ornament at Men’s waist.

“That Jade Bagua at your belt,” Lai Lixia demanded, “where did you obtain it?”

As the Zhao brothers rejoined the group, Men clutched his pendant defensively. “Bandits daring to rob me? You clearly don’t know who I am!”

“We’ve tracked this stolen sect treasure for days!” Yue Jing brandished his sword. “Hand over the Eight Trigrams Jade now!”

Lai Lixia’s eyes lit with recognition. “Senior Brother, look! The crimson veins flowing through green jade—exactly as the Patriarch described!”

Zhao Er-gongzi interposed himself. “By what proof do you claim this artifact? The young master wears it openly.”

“Proof?” Yue Jing snorted. “This sacred instrument responds only to our sect’s techniques! Let me demonstrate—”

“Deception!” Men spat. “This jade’s been mine for years! Guards! Summon the city watch!”

As an attendant fled, Men blustered, “My father governs this city! Harm me and you’ll—”

Steel flashed. Yue Jing’s blade pierced Men’s shoulder, then his thigh. The pampered noble crumpled, blood streaming as Lai Lixia wrested the jade from his grasp.

“No!” Men writhed. “Thieves! That’s mine!”

From an upper window of Echo Pavilion, courtesan Xiliu observed coldly. “Spoiled whelps reap what they sow.”

Her companion Cuihua worried, “But provoking the City Lord’s son...”

“The Crimson Lotus cares naught for politics when their Patriarch’s treasure is at stake,” Xiliu replied. “Though these hotheaded disciples may regret their methods.”

Below, Zhao Er-gongzi helped the bleeding Men while challenging the martial artists: “Dare you leave your names?”

“Insects needn’t know the storm’s name!” Yue Jing sheathed his blade. The sect siblings departed swiftly, unaware of townsfolk trailing them toward Crimson Lotus’s safehouse.

As the assailants vanished, Zhao Da-gongzi bellowed at gathering onlookers, “Mark this outrage! The City Lord’s justice will hunt these dogs!”

Men groaned through gritted teeth, torn between pain and stubborn pride. “I’ll... never yield...” His vision swam as shouts of “Fetch the physician!” erupted around him.

Chapter 3,451: Brotherhood Tested

The Zhao brothers exchanged grim looks. Though powerless against martial artists, they remained by their friend’s side—a loyalty noted by both sneering peasants and those rushing to inform the City Lord.

In shadows, Xiliu mused to her protege, “Observe well, Cuihua. Tonight’s drama reveals much—the sect’s desperation, the City Lord’s weakness, and which rats will abandon ship first.” Her lacquered nails drummed the windowsill. “When the flood comes, stand with neither righteous nor wicked... but the inevitable.”
