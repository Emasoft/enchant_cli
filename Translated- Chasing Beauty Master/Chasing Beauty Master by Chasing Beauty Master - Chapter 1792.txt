“You’re right. Still, I feel the punishment is too lenient. Sending them to Qianhui Peak in a few days to labor and reflect seems insufficient.”

“Is that so?” Guan Yu chuckled. “Well, that’s perfect. Qianhui Peak has livestock and endless farmwork. Let them toil and learn their lesson.”

Turning around, Guan Yu added, “Xiao Zhi brought Du Bingyan back to our Yunqing Sect. Given our friendship with him, shouldn’t we prepare gifts for our future sister-in-law?”

“Right! I’d nearly forgotten. We ought to show some sincerity.” Wang Jun stood hastily. “But I’ve nothing prepared. Do you have anything suitable to lend me?”

“Damn, I was going to ask *you*! My possessions are either too valuable or unfit for gifting,” Guan Yu grumbled.

Wang Jun nodded. Guan Yu’s treasures were indeed impractical for casual presents. “What about this?” He produced a milky-white pearl the size of a thumbnail. Guan Yu leaned closer. “Not bad. Must be worth a fortune.”

“I found it once and kept it for its charm. Since I’ve no other gifts, I’ll give her this.” Wang Jun spoke lightly, though reluctance flickered in his eyes.

The pearl’s flawless translucence made it a dazzling ornament for hairpins or robes. Guan Yu approved. “A fine choice. I’ve nothing worthy except gold leaves—my last few.”

“Are you serious? Giving gold as a gift? How crass!” Wang Jun scoffed.

“What else can I do? Without time to prepare, gold’s the only valuable I have,” Guan Yu retorted.

Wang Jun smirked. “Siqi’s probably drained you of everything but the clothes on your back.”

Guan Yu had no rebuttal. Gold leaves, at least, were both valuable and decorative. “If I had time, I’d ask Siqi what women prefer. But they’re waiting outside!”

“Hurry up! Are you done yet?” Wang Jun snapped. “We’ll present the gifts at Xuanzhong Peak in front of Elder Zheng. Let’s go!”

After a hasty wash, Guan Yu followed, not wanting to keep Xiao Zhi waiting. The fact that Xiao Zhi had first sought him out underscored their bond, making a gift essential.

Outside, Guan Yu gaped at a wooden contraption in the courtyard. “What’s this?!”

“Must you always overreact?” Wang Je rolled his eyes. “It’s clearly a bird-shaped flying device. Look at those wings!”

Xiao Zhi strode over, grinning. “Behold my creation! It flies using spiritual energy—perfect for Hushou Peak’s no-flight zone!”

“You’re joking.” Guan Yu eyed the crude wooden bird skeptically. A seat was carved into its back, and the wings, though bulky, seemed functional.

“It carries two!” Xiao Zhi declared, pulling Du Bingyan onto the seat. He channeled his spiritual energy through his bronze lock artifact, and the bird’s wings began flapping. With a wobble, it lifted into the air. “See you at Xuanzhong Peak!”

“Unbelievable!” Guan Yu watched them ascend. The lightweight poplar wood and spiritual propulsion mimicked a helicopter’s rotors.

“He’s mocking us!” Guan Yu huffed. “Waking us early only to leave us walking!”

**Chapter 4689: Meeting the In-Laws**

At Xuanzhong Peak, Elder Zheng awaited them. Last time, he’d greeted Guan Yu personally, but today, as elders, he and his wife remained seated.

Xiao Zhi led Du Bingyan forward, her hand trembling in his. Guan Yu noted the wooden bird’s shaky landing—proof of Xiao Zhi’s novice piloting.

“Reckless flying,” Guan Yu teased. “No license for that thing!” The comment baffled Xiao Zhi, but Wang Je shot Guan Yu a withering look.

Inside the grand hall, Elder Zheng and Madam Luo Jie sat solemnly. After formal greetings, Madam Luo rushed to Du Bingyan. “Such a lovely girl! You must stay here with Xiao Zhi!”

Elder Zheng interjected, “Let her adjust first. No need to overwhelm her.”

Guan Yu seized the moment. “Du Bingyan’s endured much hardship. Without Xiao Zhi, she’d have been lost after her parents’ passing.” The room softened with sympathy.

Elder Zheng turned to Guan Yu. “The desert journey must’ve been harsh. You’ve both darkened from the sun.”

“It was perilous,” Guan Yu admitted. “A sandstorm claimed three senior disciples early on. You were wise to keep Xiao Zhi here.”

Madam Luo ushered Du Bingyan to a prepared room while Elder Zheng inquired about their travels, his stern demeanor belying paternal concern. The day’s tensions eased into camaraderie, the sect abuzz with the rare joy of new beginnings.
