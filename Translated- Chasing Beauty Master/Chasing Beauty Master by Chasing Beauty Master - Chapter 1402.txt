However, he dared not actually strike, nor could he reach. At this moment, Guan Yu's opening cannon positioned at the center directly bypassed his own pawn to capture the opponent's soldier. After this move, only an elephant now stood between Guan Yu's cannon and the enemy general, creating an imminent checkmate scenario.

Guan Yu exhaled in relief, thinking he could finally break through the opponent's elephant defense. After his chariot made the capture, it could swiftly retreat while keeping Demon Sovereign's trapped cannon in reserve – a guaranteed capture he needn't hurry to claim.

"Check," Guan Yu calmly declared.

Wang Xiaorong clapped excitedly, exclaiming, "Bravo! Guan Yu's truly remarkable! Father, it seems you're outmatched now. Make your move quickly, or his cannon will threaten your general!"

"Cease your prattle. I know my next move," Demon Sovereign snapped irritably. The board's situation shifted like quicksilver – what had seemed advantageous moments ago now tilted against him.

Forced to respond to the check, Demon Sovereign moved an advisor to block the cannon's path. With both an elephant and advisor now shielding his general, the cannon's line of fire was obstructed by two pieces instead of one, nullifying its immediate threat.

As Demon Sovereign completed this move, Guan Yu immediately seized the opportunity to capture the bottommost elephant with his chariot. The Demon Sovereign frowned – both his elephants had been positioned in defensive squares, yet this reckless capture left one vulnerable. Didn't Guan Yu fear counterattack from the remaining elephant?

Upon closer inspection, Demon Sovereign realized Guan Yu's central cannon still threatened from its elevated position, guarded by the remaining elephant and advisor. If he attempted to retaliate by moving his elephant to capture the chariot, it would leave only the advisor shielding his general – restoring the cannon's lethal line of fire through single-piece penetration.

Thus Demon Sovereign could only watch helplessly as his elephant fell. "This loss cuts deep," he muttered. Earlier, he'd sacrificed a cannon to take Guan Yu's elephant, but that trapped cannon now became a lingering liability. Guan Yu hadn't captured it yet merely due to pressing priorities.

With no counterplay available, Demon Sovereign advanced his knight to threaten Guan Yu's central cannon – a move instantly anticipated. Guan Yu immediately repositioned his chariot to block the knight's path, pinning the steed in place through clever positional play.

"Demon Sovereign," Guan Yu warned, "if that knight remains, I'll be compelled to take it."

"Your game shows promise," the Demon Lord conceded grudgingly. "At least you play better than Azure Dragon Left Envoy." In truth, Guan Yu's chess skills were rusty remnants from youth, never truly honed to mastery.

"You flatter me. I'm but a novice in this art," Guan Yu demurred.

As pieces shifted across the board, Guan Yu gradually recognized the trap. The supposedly trapped cannon he'd dismissed as easy prey now revealed its insidious purpose – not only had it claimed one of his elephants, but it also pinned down a chariot in containment duty. Meanwhile, two of Demon Sovereign's pawns had crossed the river, advancing like twin daggers toward Guan Yu's territory.

The ancient adage proved true – "A pawn crossing the river rivals a chariot." These advancing foot soldiers demanded immediate attention, forcing Guan Yu into constant reactionary moves. Every development on the board now compelled response, leaving no breathing room to deal with the lingering cannon threat.

Demon Sovereign's knight leapt to position itself for capturing the central cannon. Guan Yu faced a dilemma – trade cannons and lose his own, or retreat the artillery piece and abandon containment. Both options carried heavy costs.

"Your choice, Guan Yu," Demon Sovereign prodded, seizing the tactical pause for conversation. "Tell me – what brings one from your realm to ours? Surely not aimless wandering?"

"My arrival was accidental," Guan Yu replied frankly. "Only after entering Yunqing Sect as Elder Xuanming's disciple did purpose emerge. The sect's cultivation methods help loosen the seal imprisoning my memories and qi."

Demon Sovereign's eyes narrowed. "Yunqing's gain is our loss. A dual cultivator of magic and martial arts would have been treasured in our ranks. Pity they found you first."

Guan Yu shrugged. "Fate's design. The seal's erosion through spiritual cultivation is my true aim. All else serves that purpose."

"Yet Yunqing won't let rare talent idle," Demon Sovereign countered. "They'll send you on endless missions until spent. Not the peaceful study you seek."

"Trials temper the spirit," Guan Yu deflected, wary of recruitment hints. "Each mission becomes cultivation."

Their verbal dance mirrored the chess struggle. When Guan Yu finally captured the trapped cannon, Demon Sovereign immediately claimed the central artillery in exchange. The trade left Guan Yu's offensive crippled while empowering Demon Sovereign's position.

Xiaorong observed anxiously, "The tide's turned! Earlier advantage has vanished!"

Indeed, Guan Yu now saw through Demon Sovereign's ploy – feigned incompetence masking calculated strategy. What appeared as Guan Yu's early dominance had been illusion, the true threat festering in those river-crossing pawns now running amok.

As Guan Yu struggled to contain the pawns, Demon Sovereign pressed: "What of Yunqing's sacred relic? Not the Merit Cauldron, but their true treasure – the Hidden Dragon Sword?"

Guan Yu's expression remained neutral. "Rumors say it's guarded in the Ancestral Hall, but I've seen no trace during my seclusion there."

"Pity," Demon Sovereign mused. "That blade could shatter seals... or realms. But enough talk – your move, young dragon. Let's see if Yunqing's teachings extend to endgames."

The board crackled with tension, every piece a soldier in their silent war of strategy and wills.
