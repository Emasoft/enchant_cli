Piao Xu’s gaze flickered as he glanced at his agent beside him. The guy was even skinnier and smaller than himself. Even if they teamed up, they’d be no match for this brute! Staring at Guan Yu’s burly physique, Piao Xu genuinely felt a twinge of fear.

Recalling how the Xu Gate big shot had treated Guan Yu during dinner, it seemed picking a fight with him in N City wouldn’t end well. His bodyguards were all waiting in the car outside. Should he run out now to call for help? That’d be even more humiliating!

With a snort, Piao Xu pointed at Guan Yu. “Barbarian! No class! Country bumpkin!”

“You’re really asking for a beating!” Guan Yu rolled up his sleeves, ready to strike. Piao Xu squeaked in fear, scrambling aside while warily eyeing him. Gao Wei, biting her lip to suppress laughter, grabbed Guan Yu’s arm.

“Enough…” she murmured softly.

“Miss Gao, look at your friend’s manners! So quick to violence! I’m only tolerating this for your sake, otherwise… I’d teach him a proper lesson!” Though knowing he stood no chance against Guan Yu, Piao Xu refused to back down verbally.

Gao Wei looked at him amusedly, arching an eyebrow with a dazzling smile. “Don’t mind me! This is between you two. Settle it yourselves. Don’t drag me into it!”

“I… I just want you to see this man’s true ugly nature! Miss Gao, you should stay away from such uncouth, tasteless men. Don’t get fooled!”

“Since when do you control my affairs? Why tell me? Are you scared of him? Don’t men love proving bravery through duels? There’s plenty of space here… Begin. I’ll wait outside.” With a radiant smile, she glided away gracefully.

Watching her retreating figure, Guan Yu froze. Damn… What a crafty move! She actually stirred conflict, pushing us toward a duel! Does she want more drama? With two sentences, she’s pushed us to the brink!

Piao Xu had no courage for a real fight. His face flushed with conflicting emotions, teeth clenched as he nervously watched for any sudden moves from Guan Yu.

“What’re you staring at? She’s gone! Still want to play hero?”

Piao Xu remained stone-faced, silently watching Guan Yu casually light a cigarette and stroll out.

“Goddamn bitch…” Piao Xu trembled with suppressed rage, on the verge of tears. When had he ever been humiliated like this? Wherever he went, people fawned over him. Now this utter disgrace!

“Young Master Piao, that Gao Wei is despicable! You should find a way to fuck her hard—that’ll tame her!” The wiry agent suggested slyly, beady eyes glinting.

Piao Xu kicked over a chair, face twisted with fury. Being mocked and looked down by Gao Wei was intolerable.

“That… That slut just needs a good fucking! Acting all chaste! I’ll get some strong aphrodisiacs—make her beg for it! Let’s see if I can’t break that bitch!”

“Master, I’ve wanted to say this! Let’s plant pinhole cameras in her dressing room. Once we have nude photos, she’ll submit like those other actresses, crawling into your bed!” The assistant leered, winking obscenely.

Panting heavily, Piao Xu grinned savagely. “Jun’er, you want a taste too, eh? These women from their country are born whores—pretending to be pure! Hurry with the cameras and drugs! I’ll pin that ice queen singer beneath me and fuck her senseless!” His eyes burned crimson with manic intensity.

“Don’t worry, Master. I’m experienced at this! Not my first rodeo!”

The two predators chuckled conspiratorially, oblivious to the phone recording everything from Gao Wei’s abandoned chair.

Over half an hour later, after another scene, Gao Wei returned to her dressing room and found her phone still recording.

Stopping the playback, she initially smiled at the banter between Guan Yu and herself. But as Piao Xu’s vile words followed, her expression darkened.

Disgusting! Scum! Beast! Her hand trembled with rage. Though showbiz had its share of wolves in sheep’s clothing, she’d never encountered filth like Piao Xu.

Slamming the phone on the table, she stormed out.

At dusk, as Guan Yu and Niu Le prepared to leave, Gao Wei approached.

“Help me.” She dragged them to her dressing room where Piao Xu was humming while wiping his face.

Without warning, Niu Le grabbed Piao Xu’s head and smashed it against the wall.

Thud! Clutching his skull, Piao Xu collapsed.

**Chapter 344: Are All You Men Like This?**

Before Piao Xu could react, Niu Le grabbed a bench and swung twice—wood splintered as Piao Xu curled up wailing.

The sudden assault left Piao Xu dazed. Who dared attack him here? His bodyguards outside never imagined danger in the studio’s heart.

Guan Yu leaned casually by the door smoking. Niu Le alone sufficed for this trash.

“Stop… Enough!” Seeing Piao Xu’s battered state might delay filming, Gao Wei finally intervened.

Niu Le tossed the broken bench leg at Piao Xu and strutted out proudly.

As Piao Xu fumbled for his phone, Gao Wei coldly slapped him.

“You… You bitch dare hit me!” Abandoning pretense, he lunged—only to be spun around by another slap.

Gao Wei played the damning recording.

“You’re a beast! Have you no shame?”

Piao Xu’s eyes glinted crimson. “Exactly! I want to fuck you! Stop playing innocent—I’ll make you scream!” He grabbed his crotch, pants tenting obscenely.

Gao Wei recoiled in horror. “Pervert! Disgusting!”

“How much? Give me the recording and I’ll pay well. You’ll enjoy it!” He advanced until her scream brought Guan Yu and Niu Le crashing in.

Cornered behind a chair, Piao Xu stammered excuses.

“Disgusting! This recording will ruin you!” Gao Wei trembled with fury.

Piao Xu forced a laugh. “Miss Gao… I was just rehearsing! Don’t take it seriously!”

“Bullshit!” Her whisper shook with rage.

Realizing the consequences, Piao Xu paled. “I’ll compensate you! Just don’t release—”

Gao Wei stormed out without hearing more.

Baffled, Guan Yu followed. “Are all men such perverts? Only wanting that?!”

“Wait! What’s that got to do with me?!”

“Leave me alone!” She coldly departed.

**Chapter 345: Can’t Be Bothered**

The next day, Gao Wei arrived with four bodyguards, dismissing Guan Yu and Niu Le. They lounged contentedly in the back, chatting with crew members.

At lunch, Guan Yu nodded at Gao Wei—she walked past icily.

“Fuck this!” Guan Yu grumbled, joining the crew’s lunch banter.

Nearby, Piao Xu approached Gao Wei’s sunshade. Their tense exchange ended with him leaving, face twitching between fear and malice.

Noticing this, Guan Yu almost used his investigative skills—then decided against it. “Her highness can handle her own mess.”

Meanwhile, Gao Wei held firm, threatening Piao Xu with the recording unless he behaved. Satisfied with his newfound deference, she ignored the brewing storm.

When Piao Xu later tried bargaining for the recording, Gao Wei remained adamant. “Your fate depends on my mood.”

Unseen by her, Piao Xu’s eyes glinted dangerously as he left.

At midday break, Guan Yu spotted Piao Xu’s sinister glance but shrugged it off. “Not my problem.”

“Let’s skip the indoor scenes.” Guan Yu stretched, bored. Niu Le ogled actresses until Guan Yu dragged him off. “Drinks!”

As they left, crewman Lao Luo called: “Brother! Lend a hand!”
