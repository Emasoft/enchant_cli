“Elder Dai, you should know that my elder brother has a fondness for wine—the kind that never seems to satisfy him,” Guan Yu said with feigned seriousness. “When we stayed at Qianhui Peak, Master Lu kept him well-supplied. But these past few days here, he’s had nothing to drink. Though it troubles him, it’s nothing grave. Please don’t worry.”

“No wine to drink?” Elder Dai replied with equal solemnity. “Though Cloud Azure Sect forbids disciples from drinking, Second Brother Jin Ci isn’t one of us. Why deny him? Guan Yu, I’ll send someone to fetch fine wine for him immediately. After your match, you can take it back. We must never let Second Brother go thirsty.”

Guan Yu had anticipated this. Mentioning Jin Ci’s plight guaranteed Elder Dai’s eager compliance. Her desire to curry favor with the man known as Second Only to the Wolf was palpable. His true motive, however, was to bury the gifted wine in the woods—ensuring a steady supply for future feasts.

“On behalf of Brother Jin Ci, I thank you, Elder Dai.” Guan Yu bowed slightly.

“Think nothing of it. When you return, ask if he lacks anything else. Though my influence in Cloud Azure Sect is limited, fulfilling Second Brother’s modest requests is well within my power.”

“Your generosity will be conveyed,” Guan Yu said with a smile.

Elder Dai chuckled warmly, personally escorting Guan Yu to the assembly grounds. Xiao Zhi gaped, astonished by the unprecedented honor—no other contestant had ever been greeted with such deference. Even Sect Leader Zheng wouldn’t receive such treatment.

After instructing two disciples to retrieve the wine, Elder Dai departed. Xiao Zhi whispered, “Brother Jin Ci seemed fine earlier. Why claim he’s troubled?”

Guan Yu smirked. “Do you object to stocking more wine? Second Only to the Wolf drains barrels like the sea. Best to prepare.”

Xiao Zhi’s eyes widened in admiration. “Your foresight humbles me!”

As the match neared, Elder Dai returned. “Guan Yu, though Xiaotong is no match for you, I implore you to show mercy. Do not harm her.”

“You have my word,” Guan Yu assured.

The arena buzzed as the referee announced: “Tiger Head Peak’s Guan Yu versus Assembly Peak’s Xiaotong!”

The two ascended the platform, halting five paces apart. Xiaotong’s face twisted in reluctance—crossing blades with Guan Yu spelled certain defeat.

“Was last night’s talk for nothing?” she pouted, sword untouched.

Guan Yu sighed. “Duty binds me, Senior Sister. But if you demand my surrender, I’ll comply.”

“Empty words!” She huffed. “A life debt deserves more than wasted here. Shouldn’t you repay tenfold?”

“Must we duel? I vow to gift you a treasure matching the tournament’s fourth-rank prize.”

Her eyes lit. “You’ll give me your fourth-rank artifact?”

“Not that exact piece,” he clarified. “But one of equal worth. It may take time—”

“So you mock me!” Tears welled in her eyes.

“Never! The pledge stands—when and how, I cannot yet say. Will you wait?”

After feigned deliberation, Xiaotong nodded. “Very well. But this doesn’t erase your debt!”

As Guan Yu agreed, she suddenly drew her Cloud Azure Sword. “Let’s begin! I might still win!”

The crowd gasped as Guan Yu blurred into motion. Before spellcraft brightened her blade, his dagger kissed her throat, free hand trapping her sword hilt—and the fingers beneath.

“Match concluded!” cried the stunned referee. “Victory to Tiger Head Peak!”

Xiao Zhi’s cheers died under glares from Assembly Peak’s disciples. Xiaotong blushed furiously as Guan Yu released her. “Was the prolonged grip... intentional?” she whispered.

“Necessity,” he insisted, retreating hastily.

Elder Dai intercepted them post-match. “Where shall we deliver the wine?”

“My quarters at Tiger Head Peak’s rear courtyard—third chamber,” Guan Yu replied.

As they departed, Xiao Zhi marveled. “Elder Dai—the ‘Ice Matriarch’—treats you like royalty! Are you her secret lovechild?”

Guan Yu snorted. “Speculate less, drink more. The wine arrives soon.”

Their laughter echoed down the mountain path, shadows lengthening like the intricate webs of favor and ambition weaving through Cloud Azure Sect.
