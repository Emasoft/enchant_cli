**Chapter 4232: Farewell**

This time, Grandpa remained silent throughout the journey, not uttering a single word. Qiqi’s grandmother was laid to rest in a small thatched hut on the outskirts of town. The hut had long been abandoned and desolate, but after a quick tidying by Qiqi, it became Grandma’s final resting place.

Upon returning, Grandpa said, “Qiqi, start the fire. I’ll go out to gather more firewood.”

“Yes, Grandpa,” Qiqi replied obediently. She glanced at yesterday’s ashes—the fire had burned out completely. Since she needed to brew Grandma’s medicine later, she’d have to relight it.

For some reason, the firewood proved stubborn today. Qiqi struggled for what felt like hours, her face smudged with soot, before finally coaxing flames to life. “Don’t worry, Grandma!” she called out cheerfully. “Your medicine will be ready soon!”

Grandma lay on a straw mat inside, listening. The thought of having such a dutiful granddaughter brought her peace—her life had not been in vain.

Just then, Grandpa returned. One arm cradled a hefty bundle of firewood against his shoulder, while the other carried a cluster of mysterious items.

Qiqi hurried over to help unload the wood. Peering at Grandpa’s parcels, she asked, “Grandpa, what’s all this? I think I smell something delicious!”

“Hehe, you little rascal! Your nose never fails!” Grandpa chuckled. “I bought plenty of good food—even a roast chicken! Tonight, we feast!” He strode into the hut, laughter trailing behind him.

After brewing and feeding Grandma her medicine, Qiqi set the bowl aside. Grandpa laid out the wine and dishes near Grandma’s mat.

“Grandpa, what’s the occasion?” Qiqi tilted her head. “Why so much food? And you haven’t touched wine in ages—why buy it now?”

“Today’s a grand day—*your* grand day,” Grandpa replied, tearing a strip of chicken and placing it gently into Grandma’s mouth.

For years, meals had been like this: Qiqi or Grandpa feeding Grandma bite by bite, as her paralyzed limbs left her dependent on their care.

“Oh? Did you earn extra silver today?” Qiqi teased, eyes sparkling.

“Here, have a drumstick.” Grandpa handed her a juicy piece. “We’ve endured hard times, but we’ve survived. Tomorrow… you might leave for your training. This meal is to send you off properly.”

“W-what?” Qiqi stammered. “You’re letting me learn martial arts from Brother Old Cang? But… does that mean you won’t come with me?”

“Correct. I must stay to care for Grandma. If we both go, who’ll look after her?” Grandpa took a sip of wine and patted Qiqi’s shoulder. “You’ve grown up, Qiqi. It’s time to venture beyond street performances. This could be your turning point—I must support you.”

Grandma stirred anxiously, her tongue stumbling over unintelligible sounds.

“I know you worry for her safety,” Grandpa said, turning to Grandma. “But if we cling too tightly, she’ll never spread her wings. Let her forge her own path. We old folks can’t shackle her forever.”

Grandma’s eyes met Qiqi’s. Though she nodded in agreement, a single tear betrayed her heartache.

Excitement and guilt warred within Qiqi. “But Grandpa, I don’t want to leave you both! What if you can’t manage alone? I’d rather stay and protect you!”

“Nonsense!” Grandpa chided. “This opportunity is rare! Seize it! A life trapped here is no life at all—I won’t let my regrets become yours.” He drank again. “Old Cang… he’s a decent man. Eccentric dress aside, his actions today reveal extraordinary character. With him, you’ll be safe. Learn well, and return to us when you’re ready.”

The final words hung bittersweet—both knew the elderly couple’s days were numbered.

“But your performances!” Qiqi protested. “You need my help! And Grandma’s care—”

“Enough!” Grandpa’s tone softened. “Go, child. We’ll manage.”

Qiqi fell silent. Never once had she defied Grandpa… until now. Her mind raced—how would they afford Grandma’s medicine without her earnings?

**Chapter 4233: Breaking In**

Suddenly, Qiqi brightened. “I’ll go—on one condition. Brother Old Cang pays me five taels daily. I’ll ask for fifty upfront. If he agrees, I’ll leave it with you. Otherwise, I stay.”

“Fifty taels? Impossible!” Grandpa gasped. “My street acts will cover us!”

“Then I won’t go.” Qiqi’s voice hardened. “I don’t need glory—just you two.”

“You *will* obey me this time!”

Tears welled in Qiqi’s luminous eyes. She’d find a way—even three days’ silver might tide them over. Resolved, she’d secure funds before leaving.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu arrived at the City Lord’s Manor with his men. The gates stood shut.

“Has Minister Zhang returned?” Guan Yu demanded.

“Unclear,” Zou Wuhui replied.

“Take men to the rear. Break in if barred.” Guan Yu’s gaze turned icy. “The rest wait here. If no one answers, we storm the gates. Kill any who resist!”

Zou Wuhui’s group found the back entrance similarly sealed. “Smash it!”

At the front, guards rammed the heavy doors futilely. Wang Xiaorong soared skyward, surveying the compound. “Zou’s group is inside—the place is nearly empty!”

Guan Yu unsheathed his Soulfall Blade. Dou Qi Slashes boomed against the gates, shaking the lintel loose. A hulking figure named Hongren charged—wood splintered as a door crashed inward.

“Search every corner!” Guan Yu ordered. “Find Prince Zou!”

They scoured stables, privies—nothing. A trembling maid revealed, “M-Minister Zhang is in the main hall…”

There, Prince Zou, Xiao Zhi, and Wang Jun feasted lavishly with Minister Zhang.

“Careful, Your Highness!” Guan Yu warned from the doorway. “The food may be poisoned!”

“*You’re* the poison!” Prince Zou laughed. “Join us—but leave the others outside.”

Guan Yu eyed Minister Zhang. “I hear you serve the Second Prince now. Quite the honor.”

Prince Zou stiffened. Minister Zhang forced a smile. “One must align with power to survive here. The Second Prince never ordered me to act against you—”

“Lies sweeter than songs!” Guan Yu stepped forward. “We’re leaving.”

“You think my manor is a tavern?” Minister Zhang slammed the table. Soldiers swarmed the exits—black-clad, golden-hilted blades glinting.

**Chapter 4234: Contempt**

Minister Zhang’s facade crumbled. The roast lamb centerpiece hid muscle-softening poison—a failed gambit. Now exposed as the Second Prince’s pawn, he sneered, “Did you truly believe you could waltz in and out? Even a prince deserves no respect here!”

The trap snapped shut. But Guan Yu’s hand tightened on his blade—this battle had just begun.
