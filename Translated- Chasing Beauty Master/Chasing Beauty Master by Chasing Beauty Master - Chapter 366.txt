“She stared at Guan Yu’s retreating figure, her silver teeth clenched in hatred, emitting a grating sound.

She was utterly furious!

Guan Yu clearly realized his mistake yet feigned ignorance, acting as if nothing had happened despite taking advantage. Li Xi’s lungs nearly burst with rage at the sight.

If Li Yuanshan were here to see Li Xi in this state, he’d surely gape in astonishment!

The current Li Xi no longer resembled an icy goddess but more a wronged young bride.

Taking a deep breath, Li Xi composed herself, slipping back into her usual demeanor. Clicking her heels, she followed Guan Yu out the door.

In the Mercedes, Guan Yu drove while Li Xi sat silently in the back, the atmosphere awkward.

Peeking at Li Xi through the rearview mirror, Guan Yu stifled laughter, coughing before asking, “So... what’s the plan today?”

Since boarding, Li Xi had ignored him, leaving Guan Yu clueless about their agenda.

He assumed she remained angry.

This petty side of Li Xi was rare, amusing Guan Yu.

Li Xi saw through his thoughts but, numb to it, dismissed his trivial musings.

“We’re meeting Chen Lin,” she replied flatly.

“Chen Lin? That ‘Sea Turtle’?” Guan Yu frowned.

Li Xi nodded. “Chen Lin is pivotal to our research project. We must secure him as your key ally.”

Guan Yu’s expression turned grave. The project’s importance demanded perfection—no room for error.

**Chapter 920: I’m Her Boss**

At the same teahouse, Guan Yu received vastly different treatment due to Jiang Ziqi’s influence—and Wu Bao’s desire to curry favor.

Guan Yu’s mother’s diligence stirred sympathy among middle-aged women. Yet who would accept his well-meaning aid when others exploited daughters for profit?

Li Xi had resisted such exploitation, confronting Sun Mande’s outrageous demands in court.

Now, that stalemate had shattered.

Their target today wasn’t the tyrannical Sun Mande but Chen Lin.

Chen Lin—renowned MIT graduate, a prodigy in energy storage. His talent was crucial for Guan Yu’s ambitions. Sacrificing time with Wenqing, Guan Yu accompanied Li Xi to the teahouse.

Yet trouble brewed before the meeting even began.

Chen Lin was late. Guan Yu and Li曦 sat waiting, exchanging baffled glances.

“Seems this ‘Sea Turtle’ won’t be easily handled,” Guan Yu remarked dryly.

Li Xi replied coolly, “If he refuses, it’s your loss. I’m merely playing secretary—without a secretary’s authority.”

Guan宇 chuckled. “A joke warrants such concern?”

Leaning closer, he teased, “Must you worry so?”

Li Xi met his gaze solemnly. “This is an investment. Risks and rewards coexist. My stake is minor compared to yours.”

关宇’s eyes gleamed mischievously. “By your logic, I’m the fool funding everything while you reap rewards. Shouldn’t you contribute more?”

李曦 arched a brow, unmoved.

Suddenly, the door opened. A smug, impeccably dressed man entered—Chen Lin.

Ignoring Guan Yu, Chen临 aimed a kiss at Li曦’s hand.

关宇 intercepted, gripping Chen临’s arm. “Chen Lin? The ‘Sea Turtle’? Pleasure.”

陈临 glared. “Who are you? Get out!”

关宇 smirked. “I’m Li Xi’s boss—soon to be yours. Think you can evict me?”

**Chapter 921: No Deal**

“Boss?” Chen临 scoffed. “If you’re the boss, I’d be a billionaire by now!”

关宇 gestured dismissively. “If you’re the genius, why no takers? Too greedy?”

陈临 stiffened. “You dare insult my credentials?!”

关宇 shrugged. “Real geniuses don’t need threats. Leave—but pay for your drink first.”

陈临 spluttered. “I didn’t drink it!”

关宇 smiled. “The venue was your choice. You pay.”

陈临’s face purpled. “Fine. But you’ll regret this!”

关宇 leaned back. “You need this platform more than we need you. Greed blinds you.”

陈临 froze, realizing 关宇 had pierced his facade.

**Chapter 922: Overreach**

陈临 stood seething. 关宇 had exposed his desperation.

He needed a platform for his ambitions—but none met his exorbitant demands.

关宇’s gaze sharpened. “Too much greed destroys potential. Leave.”

陈临 stormed out, pride in tatters.

关宇 turned to 李曦. “Find someone less self-important. True progress needs humility.”

李曦 nodded, a faint smile gracing her lips.
