Twenty years ago, she had been a delicate blossom in full bloom, tender and vibrant. Though others might see little change in her appearance now, Liu Shilei knew the truth—regardless of outward looks, her heart had long grown still as an ancient well, untouched by ripples.

As she lamented the passage of time, Zhu Qianqian's voice drifted in. A student had strayed onto the fifth floor. Liu Shilei intended to tell Zhu not to trouble the youth, for the third class would soon begin. Even at Mingyang Elite High, where most students came from privileged backgrounds and treated studies as mere pastimes, Liu Shilei believed the school bore responsibility. Whether they cared or not, these youths deserved guidance.

But before she could speak, a voice pierced her soul—a sound etched into her bones, echoing through countless dreams. Her legs nearly buckled.

She'd believed this voice lost forever, its owner gone from her life. Yet now it resonated outside her office door. Was this real? Or another cruel dream destined to leave her pillow soaked?

A pinch confirmed the truth: pain meant this was no illusion. Still, she reasoned—even an identical voice must be coincidence. Twenty years of inquiries about the Divine Realm had yielded grim truths: none who entered returned. Most who approached perished; a handful gained strange powers through mutation. Those who ventured inside? No survivors.

If hope had flickered initially, two decades extinguished it. Thus, Liu Shilei assured herself—this resemblance meant nothing. Guan Yu couldn't possibly return.

**Chapter 1643: The Beauty Remains as Before**

From the exchange between Zhu Qianqian and Guan Yu, Liu Shilei gathered a student had wandered upstairs seeking her. Though most here were untouchable scions, Liu Shilei feared none. Guan Yu's old comrades still revered her, and his company now ranked among China's foremost enterprises. These students' pedigrees meant little to her.

Direct appeals to the principal were unheard of—parents typically handled matters through proper channels. Normally, she'd dismiss such impertinence. But that voice... so achingly familiar. After a pause, she called out, “Xiao Zhu, since this student has come all this way, let him in.”

Zhu Qianqian marveled inwardly. The unflappable Principal Liu, who never indulged wayward youths, now invited an intruder? Highly irregular.

Though puzzled, Zhu turned to Guan Yu. “The principal will see you. Follow me.”

Inside, Liu Shilei had retreated behind her desk, maintaining professional decorum. Outside, Guan Yu trembled—even as a peerless powerhouse commanding wind and rain, this woman remained his guiding star, the one for whom he'd move heaven and earth.

Zhu frowned at his hesitation. “Hurry! Class is starting.” How odd—the principal's unprecedented leniency, the student's inexplicable agitation.

Little did she know these two, separated for twenty years, were star-crossed lovers reunited. Had she realized this “student” was Liu Shilei’s long-lost beloved, shock might have felled her.

Guan Yu inhaled deeply and stepped across the threshold.

Liu Shilei’s gaze locked on the doorway, desperate to glimpse this voice-doppelgänger. Zhu lingered, expecting delegated tasks. What she witnessed next defied all precedent.

At the sight of that face, Liu Shilei shot up with a gasp. Her typically serene features flushed crimson—eyes swimming, lips quivering, finger outstretched. “Is it... really you?”

In three years at Mingyang, Zhu had never seen the principal so overcome. This youth clearly held profound significance. A relative? Then it struck her—the student appeared twenty, Liu Shilei (despite her youthful looks) was past forty. A generational gap... unless...

Ah! Twenty years ago, Liu’s lover vanished into the Divine Realm. Could this be their child? That must explain her reaction!

Zhu’s assumptions couldn’t be further from truth.

Guan Yu drank in Liu Shilei’s face—matured yet fundamentally unchanged. Regret, tenderness, longing surged through him. He nodded firmly. “Yes. I’ve returned.”

Paradoxically, confirmation steadied Liu Shilei. She composed herself, hand pressed to chest. “Xiao Zhu, you may leave. I’ll speak with... this student privately.”

Assuming Guan Yu wished anonymity (his prior mission involving the Dragon Group required discretion), she dismissed Zhu, who needed no urging—the charged atmosphere demanded privacy.

Alone, Guan Yu smiled wistfully. “Jie, won’t you let me in? Didn’t you miss me?”

That familiar address unleashed a flood of memories. Miss him? How many tear-soaked nights had she endured?

Without waiting, Guan Yu closed the door and approached, arms open for their old embrace.

**Chapter 1644: My Heart Remains Unchanged**

Liu Shilei’s heart leaped as Guan Yu neared, her body yearning for his warmth. Yet when he reached the desk, she recoiled. “Guan Yu, no.”

He understood. Gently, he shook his head. “Jie, I’m sorry—twenty years is too long. But my heart hasn’t changed. I still love you deeply.”

The word “love” shattered her restraint. Tears cascaded. “We never stopped loving you either—Xiaojuan and I. But twenty years... We’ve aged, while you... How can this work?”

Guan Yu brushed her tears, thumb grazing her cheek. “Nonsense. You’re more beautiful now—that mature allure I’ve always adored.”

Her resolve wavered, then hardened. Better part now than face future rejection when her beauty faded. Sensing her withdrawal, Guan Yu knew patience was key. He withdrew his hand, grinning. “My principal now! From teacher to headmistress—quite the upgrade.”

Realization struck. “Dong Bin arranged your enrollment! You conspired to trick me!”

Petulance surfaced—after decades of longing, he’d sought others first? Guan Yu guided her to the sofa despite protests.

“I tried calling you first,” he explained. “But your number redirected to Dong Bin. Time flows differently—I didn’t realize twenty years had passed here.”

Guilt flooded her. He’d memorized her old number through two decades of separation...

As Guan Yu recounted his trials in the Demon Realm, Liu Shilei lived each harrowing moment—weeping at dangers, laughing at triumphs. When he paused, she shared updates: Du Xiaojuan managing his empire, Feng Xin and Mo Ling having married.

To her surprise, Guan Yu rejoiced for the latter two: “They found happiness! Unlike you two fools, waiting for a ghost.”

She glared. “You’re here now, aren’t you? And we’re not ‘old cows’ chasing ‘tender grass’!”

Seizing her hand, Guan Yu countered, “You’re eternally youthful—a woman in her prime. My appearance? Cultivation slows aging. Mentally, I’m as ancient as you!”

**Chapter 1645: He’s My Cousin**

Initially, Liu Shilei’s fears stemmed from Guan Yu’s agelessness—had he hibernated in the Divine Realm, remaining twenty in mind and heart? His tales of the Demon Realm dispelled this—he’d lived every day, maturing through tribulations.

If his extended lifespan through cultivation meant outliving her... perhaps they too could learn these arts?

Eyes sparkling, she leaned forward. “Guan Yu, can you teach Xiaojuan and me to cultivate?”

[Books are almost all available here, much more stable than regular sites with faster updates and no ads in the text.]

His youthful vigor stemmed from profound cultivation, she realized. If they could similarly prolong their lives...

Hope rekindled, Liu Shilei allowed herself to imagine a shared future—no longer separated by time’s inexorable march.
