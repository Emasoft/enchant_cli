Guan Yu had only taken a few steps when someone came running over—it was Old Sun (Grandpa Sun), who had been in the security room earlier. Panting as he ran, the old man repeatedly apologized, “I’m so sorry, truly sorry!”

Old Sun quickly ran over to the little boy. The uniformed man had already stopped hitting the child, but the boy was still wailing, his face bruised purple and blue. Tears welled in Old Sun’s eyes as he looked at the boy, clearly heartbroken. Yet he hardened his tone and scolded, “Why won’t you listen? I told you not to run out and play! The moment I took my eyes off you, you caused trouble! Apologize right now!”

Seeing the man was a law enforcement officer, Old Sun knew they couldn’t afford to offend someone in authority. Though the child was badly beaten, he could only swallow his anger—after all, the boy had caused the disturbance. The child, however, was too hysterical to comprehend apologies.

Old Sun’s rebuke was merely performative. Turning to the officer, he pleaded, “I’m terribly sorry. It’s my fault for not disciplining him properly. Please forgive us.”

**Chapter 2884: An Apology for You**

The uniformed man glared sideways at Old Sun and shoved the boy hard. The child staggered back several steps before collapsing to the ground. Old Sun froze, anguish twisting his face. This boy was his precious late-life son, born when he was over forty. Usually doted on, the child had never been struck—yet today, he’d suffered such cruelty.

“You think a fucking apology fixes this?” the officer roared. “Your brat set off firecrackers on the road and scared the shit out of me! If I demand a hospital checkup now, you’ll pay for it, understand?” He punctuated each word by jabbing Old Sun’s shoulder aggressively.

Old Sun said nothing more. Unable to stay passive, he helped the boy up, gently rubbing his head. “Hush now,” he soothed. “Go back inside. Daddy will handle this.”

In this moment, Old Sun seemed to transform into a heroic figure defending his son. Though poor and facing a uniformed officer, the injustice of the beating outweighed his child’s minor mistake. Today, he resolved, he’d protect the boy at all costs.

“Where the hell did you idiots crawl from?” the man spat. “You wake me up, say ‘sorry,’ and think that’s it? This little shit deserves a beating!”

As Old Sun tried to guide the boy back to the security room, the officer blocked them. “Stay put! No one leaves until this is settled! You think you can walk away from this?”

Guan Yu observed coldly. The officer clearly targeted Old Sun as an easy mark, exploiting his position to bully and extort. Typical of these uniformed thugs—all rotten to the core.

“Please,” Old Sun implored, “the child didn’t mean to disturb you. A magnanimous man like yourself surely won’t hold this against him.”

“Magnanimous my ass!” the officer snapped. “You think startling me is nothing? This isn’t over!”

“The brat’s asking for a beating. Let me thrash him, then I’ll apologize. How’s that?” the man sneered.

Old Sun’s composure cracked. “You want to hit my son again? Over my dead body! Yes, he erred, but you’re a grown man—how dare you brutalize a child? Don’t you have any shame?”

The officer, Wang Erzi, was a comprehensive law enforcement member shirking duty by napping in his parked car when firecrackers startled him awake. Enraged, he’d taken it out on the boy. Now, smelling weakness, he aimed to extort money—maybe a few hundred for dinner.

But Old Sun’s defiance surprised him. A nobody civilian daring to resist? Time to teach them a lesson.

“Fuck you!” Wang Erzi shouted. “If the brat’s stupid, the old fool’s stupider! I’m educating your son! Should’ve beaten him to death!” He kicked the boy’s stomach, sending him sprawling.

Old Sun shoved Wang Erzi. “He’s just a child! Are you even human? What if you cripple him?”

“Cripple? I’ll fucking kill you both!” Wang Erzi slapped Old Sun, and they grappled. The elderly man was no match for the thirty-something officer. Within moments, Old Sun lay on the ground as Wang Erzi kicked him viciously.

“Guan Yu!” Ling’er cried urgently. “Stop watching! Help them before someone dies!”

Guan Yu judged the timing right—Old Sun’s bleeding face indicated sufficient injury. “Call the police. I’ll intervene.”

Though reluctant to get involved without his usual protections, Wang Erzi’s brutality forced his hand. Even without his cultivation, Guan Yu’s combat skills could handle this thug.

“Enough!” Guan Yu strode forward, seizing Wang Erzi’s raised fist and flinging him backward. The crowd, now larger, murmured disapproval but dared not interfere.

The boy, seeing his father’s bloody nose, wailed hoarsely yet crawled to shield Old Sun. “My fault… please don’t hit Daddy…”

**Chapter 2885: A Few Days’ Rest Will Heal It**

The boy’s plea moved Ling’er to tears as she dialed the police. Bystanders whispered condemnation but feared reprisal from the uniformed clique.

Wang Erzi, assessing Guan Yu’s affluent appearance, hesitated. These bullies preyed on the weak but cowered before the privileged. “Who the hell are you?” he blustered. “Looking for a beating?”

Guan Yu coldly retorted, “Harassing them while I watched? That uniform won’t protect you much longer.”

Wang Erzi faltered—was this man connected? Retrieving an electroshock baton from his car, he brandished it. “Back off! This doesn’t concern you!”

Ignoring him, Guan Yu knelt by Old Sun. “An ambulance is coming. You won’t suffer this injustice.”

“They’re untouchable,” Old Sun groaned. “Let it go. Just bruises—I’ll recover.”

Guan Yu helped him sit, but Old Sun cried out in pain—his left leg was broken. “Don’t move. We’ll wait for medics.”

“Old bones… needs rest,” Old Sun grimaced, jaw clenched against the agony.

Wang Erzi raged, “Fucking meddler! Get lost before I shock you!”

Ling’er, comforting the battered boy, glared. “Guan Yu, this monster can’t get away with this!”

As Guan Yu nodded, Wang Erzi noticed Ling’er’s face—stunning even in distress. Lust replaced anger. “Well, well! Had I known such beauty was involved…” He leered. “Forget the fine. Just have dinner with me.”

Ling’er recoiled, masking her face. Guan Yu stepped between them. “You’re done. That uniform comes off today.”

Wang Erzi snorted. “You’re dead, pretty boy!” He lunged with the baton.

**Chapter 2886: A Kick to Kill Him**

Guan Yu dodged, disarming Wang Erzi with a twist of his wrist. The baton clattered away as Guan Yu swept the man’s legs, sending him crashing down. “Your tyranny ends here.”

The crowd erupted in cheers as police sirens approached. Wang Erzi paled—without his weapon, exposed before authorities, his bluster evaporated. Guan Yu helped Old Sun into the arriving ambulance, Ling’er clutching the traumatized boy.

“Justice,” Guan Yu murmured, “isn’t worn on a uniform.”
