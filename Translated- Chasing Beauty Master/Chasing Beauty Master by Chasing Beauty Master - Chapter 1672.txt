“These are things Ling Su and Lin Chen had done countless times back at the Yunqing Sect—threatening junior disciples for money. The same tactics worked here too, for no disciple dared defy them. They couldn’t beat him in a fight, and he even had the audacity to act boldly before Elder Xuanming. What choice did they have? Crossing him was unthinkable.

After prowling around, Ling Su had extorted—or outright robbed—five taels of silver from his fellow disciples. Grinning, he sauntered to the odd-or-even betting table. This was his favorite game, relying purely on luck. Even if the dealer wanted to cheat, it wasn’t easy here.

Unlike dice-shaking, which Ling Su believed was ripe for manipulation. If the dealer wanted to fleece players, they could force triplets every round, leaving victims helpless. The tricks were endless: weighted dice, masterful shaking—all tools for fraud.

But odd-or-even was different. Copper coins were used here, randomly scooped into a pile. No one knew the exact count, and bettors could tally them themselves, making it fairer.

Just as Ling Su was enjoying himself, Lin Chen descended. The moment he spotted gambling, restlessness seized him. Seeing Ling Su engrossed eased his mind—at least the troublemaker wasn’t stirring up real chaos.

Lin Chen, however, favored dice. Betting on high or low seemed similar to odd-or-even, but the latter dragged on with counting. Dice were faster—quick rounds, swift wins or losses, no overthinking. Just押大押小 (bet high or low) on a whim.

Ling Su argued dice were easily rigged, especially by dealers. Lin Chen countered that odd-or-even had its own cheats: experts among dealers or bettors could stealthily add or remove coins during counts.

**Chapter 4372: Just Playing Around**

The two played separately. Lin Chen noticed several Yunqing disciples gambling and seized the chance to fleece them, targeting those on winning streaks.

“Senior Brother Lin Chen, spare me!” pleaded a junior, desperation etched on his face. “I’ve barely any silver left, and I’ve already lost some. Senior Brother Ling Su already took his cut. If both of you轮流 (take turns), we’ll be ruined!”

Lin Chen paused. Ling Su had already shaken them down. Further squeezing would breed resentment—counterproductive, especially now that he and Ling Su were rivals. Winning allies mattered more.

“Haha, just teasing!” Lin Chen chuckled, handing over a silver ingot. “Ling Su’s the heartless one. Take this—play freely. Keep your winnings, but share a cut if you strike luck.”

“Senior Brother, this… isn’t proper?” The junior wavered, torn between desire and distrust. Lin Chen, though feared, wasn’t known for generosity.

Lin Chen clapped his shoulder. “No schemes. As deputy leader, I ought to照顾 (look after) you all. Enjoy!”

“Th-thank you, Senior Brother!” The junior beamed. “If you ever need help, just ask!”

“Lose cheerfully, but remember my share if you win!” Lin Chen waved, moving to another disciple.

While Ling Su plundered, Lin Chen reconsidered. Extorting scraps of silver bred hatred. Better to spend a few taels buying goodwill, securing allies for his feud with Ling Su.

Circulating nearly ten taels, Lin Chen left disciples praising his generosity—a timely boon.

From above, Guan Yu observed the chaos. Ling Su neared madness from losses, while Lin Chen had just begun. Though tempted to leave, Lin Chen stayed, lured by the thrill, forgetting earlier troubles.

Guan Yu smirked. Lin Chen’s borrowed funds would haunt him tomorrow. For now, he played obliviously.

The shrill-voiced woman from earlier stood, sighing. “Ugh—won so much, only to lose it all. Time to go. Tomorrow’s another day.”

She stretched lazily and turned to leave. Lin Chen frowned. Her uncanny guesses couldn’t be luck. If she left, he’d lose his guide.

Chasing her outside, he found her waiting near the tavern’s rear. A man emerged, tossing her a bulging purse. “Fine work today. Return tomorrow—reward’s assured.”

Lin Chen’s rage ignited. The man was the dice dealer! They were cohorts, scamming players!

“Goddammit!” he roared, leaping out. “You two schemed together, bleeding us dry!”

The woman hissed, “Silence him! Or we’re exposed!”

The man hesitated, eyeing Lin Chen’s Yunqing Sword—its gem glowing with spiritual energy. A cultivator. Dangerous.

**Chapter 4373: Shut Your Mouth**

Lin Chen brandished his sword. “Return every tael you stole, or I’ll carve it from your hides!”

“Why the fuss?” The woman sneered. “Casinos always win. Expose us, and they’ll just replace us. You gain nothing.”

Lin Chen’s blade hummed with gathered energy. “You think I fear empty threats? Hand over my losses—two hundred taels—or I’ll let the mob drown you in spit!”

The dealer paled. Lin Chen’s Yunqing Sword wasn’t ordinary—its gem, gifted by Elder Xuanming, stored double the spiritual power of common blades. One strike could maim.

“Let’s negotiate,” the man stammered. “Killing us won’t refund your silver.”

Lin Chen scoffed. “Two hundred taels. Now.”

“Impossible!” The woman tossed a meager purse. “Take fifty. Or kill us—you’ll get no more.”

Lin Chen weighed it scornfully. “Pathetic. And you?” He glared at the man, who surrendered another pitiful pouch.

“Beggars’ scraps!” Lin Chen spat. Then inspiration struck. “Here’s your chance: help me win back my losses—and more. Succeed, and I’ll stay silent.”

He flung the purses back. The pair gaped.

Smirking, Lin Chen outlined his plan. “You’ll do what you do best—cheat. But for *me* this time.”

**Chapter 4374: A Chance for Redemption**

The conspirators exchanged wary glances. Lin Chen’s eyes glinted. “Refuse, and I’ll shout your scheme to the crowd. Either way, you lose. Help me, and perhaps earn a cut.”

The woman smirked. “Clever brat. Deal.”

As the tavern’s cacophony swelled—bets on highs, lows, odds—Lin Chen reentered, the duo in tow. Tonight, the house wouldn’t win.
