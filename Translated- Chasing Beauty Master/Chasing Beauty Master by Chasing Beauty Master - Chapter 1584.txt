“It just occurred to Guanyu that Yanzhao was the person we encountered. Earlier I was puzzled, wondering why someone would use Yunqing Sect's magic techniques - and a mid-level spell at that. This shocked Guanyu, Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun. We couldn't figure out which Yunqing Sect member would attack Prince Zou here.

So it turns out to be the traitor Yanzhao. Guanyu declared loudly, 'Yanzhao! I hear you're Yunqing Sect's turncoat who's now pledged allegiance to the Soul Demon Sect. Did your Demon Master send you to openly attack Prince Zou like this? Isn't this rather ill-advised?'

Yanzhao appeared disoriented, standing motionless without responding.

Guanyu pressed on, 'Yanzhao, you've got nerve. What benefits did someone promise you to dare block Prince Zou's path?'

'Many people,' Yanzhao replied as if reaching enlightenment. 'Numerous factions bribed me with various terms to kill Prince Zou. While I am indeed Yunqing Sect's traitor, let me clarify - I have no ties to the Soul Demon Sect. Don't drag others into this. Any grievances should be directed at me alone.'

Wang Xiaorong never imagined Yanzhao would still defend the Soul Demon Sect. This man clearly had his own agenda. Considering current jianghu dynamics, having offended Yunqing Sect, Yanzhao could only survive under the Soul Demon Sect's protection. Offending them further would leave him no refuge in the martial world.

Yanzhao understood he didn't officially represent the Soul Demon Sect here. By denying his affiliation, opponents couldn't act against him. Moreover, the Demon Master hadn't formally granted him any position within the sect.

Guanyu said pointedly, 'A Yunqing traitor hired to attack a prince - what absurdity! Yanzhao, your notorious reputation precedes you. Yunqing has issued a jianghu-wide warrant. Aren't you afraid we'll inform them? When their disciples come, you'll have nowhere to run.'

Knowing his cover was blown, Yanzhao realized retreat was wisest. 'Withdraw!' he commanded coldly. His remaining thirty men retreated, resolving Prince Zou's crisis once more.

As the enemy departed, Guanyu cautioned vigilance. He dispatched men to tend wounded and clear roadblocks for the prince's carriage. After nearly two hours, they reopened the path and resumed journeying.

Guanyu sought answers from Wang Xiaorong but waited for privacy. Why would the Demon Master send Yanzhao against Prince Zou while permitting Wang Xiaorong's mission? This contradiction puzzled him deeply.

The procession advanced slowly with wounded riders. At current pace, they wouldn't reach Swordless Inn by nightfall. Guanyu considered sending an advance party with Prince Zou to secure safety.

'How much longer to Swordless Inn?' Guanyu asked Zou Wuhen by the carriage.

'This is my first journey here,' Zou Wuhen admitted. 'At our speed, perhaps more time is needed.'

A traveler ahead turned, 'We've reached the summit. Less than two hours remain to descend to Swordless Villa.'

'Good. The downhill path should quicken our pace,' Guanyu observed, noting the man's familiarity with the route.

Upon descending, the sprawling Swordless Inn came into view - a vast compound with haphazard buildings. By its entrance stood rules carved in stone: no unauthorized conflicts, challenges to Swordless Immortal excepted.

Guanyu warned the group, 'Once inside, follow all rules strictly. No disturbances. Violators will face consequences.'

Prince Zou alighted, relieved. 'Secure rooms and arrange meals. We're all weary from today's trials.'

The party entered through northern gates facing Swordless Mountain. Winding stone paths led upward - the only way to challenge the Swordless Immortal.

At reception, a blue-clad attendant questioned, 'So many of you? Are all here to challenge the Swordless Immortal?'

'Of course,' Guanyu declared. 'We seek lodging - twenty-one rooms.'

The attendant gestured at wall-mounted keys. Wang Xiaorong suggested, 'Let's take that entire building. Twenty-one rooms in one complex for easier coordination.'

Though peripheral, Guanyu approved, 'No disturbances occur here. Even if trouble arises, the inn handles it.'

Prices proved exorbitant - ten taels for ground floor, fifteen for second, twenty for third level daily. Despite the cost, they selected a three-story building at the compound's edge for privacy and security.

As night fell, the weary party settled in. Swordless Inn's peculiar regulations and absent proprietor intrigued Guanyu. Though expensive, its reputation for safety justified the price. Tomorrow's challenges awaited, but tonight, rest was paramount.”
