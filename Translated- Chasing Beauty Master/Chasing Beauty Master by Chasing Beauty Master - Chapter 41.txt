“Birds of a feather flock together,” Guan Yu thought gloomily. “With three out of four roommates here just to coast through, there’ll be no shortage of entertainment!”

“What about you? Why’d you come here?” Niu Le turned his shaggy head toward Guan Yu.

“Me? Just... coasting along! No special skills. Got in by luck!” Guan Yu chuckled casually.

He’d never admit he’d enrolled because of Fu Linlin. Too humiliating. Though he’d moved past that heartache now.

As the three chatted boisterously, their dorm door burst open. A denim-clad youth wearing sunglasses sauntered in, grinning.

“Hey! All here already? What a lively crew! Pleasure to meet you. I’m Wang Zhen—the dashing, charming, and peerlessly handsome young talent known throughout the martial world as ‘A Pear Blossom Overwhelming the Begonia’!” With theatrical flair, he bowed while abandoning his luggage.

“Damn... we got ourselves a clown,” Niu Le snorted through his teeth, grinning dopily at Guan Yu and Tian Hao.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes internally. This oaf couldn’t recognize an icebreaker if it bit him.

**Chapter 97: This Guy’s a Prodigy**

Wang Zhen’s smile froze at Niu Le’s mockery. He eyed the hulking simpleton suspiciously.

“Brother, I must educate you. Whether you deem me genius or fool, respect the facts! Observe this physique—where’s the resemblance to any ‘fool’? Spare us such nonsense henceforth.” He dragged his luggage to his bunk with strained laughter.

“Don’t mind him—he speaks before thinking,” Guan Yu murmured apologetically.

“No matter.” Wang Zhen waved it off, shooting Niu Le a sidelong glance.

The red-faced oaf rubbed his nose sheepishly and fell silent.

As the quartet settled in, Wang Zhen soon retreated behind his laptop after arranging his bedding, offering only absentminded interjections to their chatter.

“Let me tell you—our Nanjing campus has the highest concentration of beauties! Tycoons keep mistresses here. We’ve bred countless starlets too—actresses, singers...”

“Exactly!” Wang Zhen suddenly pivoted, eyes gleaming. “Surveys show 65% female students here. Half possess decent looks, 7% are stunners, 4% goddess-tier, and 0.5% bona fide heartbreakers! For eye candy, arts colleges reign supreme!”

Guan Yu gaped in awe. This guy had statistical breakdowns memorized?

“But...” Wang Zhen sighed dramatically. “While pretty, their virtue and wit? Questionable. ‘Big breasts, no brains’ as they say. Finding beauty with brains and morals here? Near impossible. Even if they exist...”

Guan Yu swallowed hard. “You researched all this beforehand?”

“Of course! My goal?” Wang Zhen smirked. “Cultivate such charisma that beauties beg me to bed them. You three?” He eyed his roommates critically. “Reaching my level? Doubtful.”

The assessment stung. Niu Le’s hulking simplicity might only attract insecure women. Tian Hao’s plump, beady-eyed visage resembled a well-fed vole—unappealing to non-pet-lovers. As for Guan Yu? Average at best, lacking Wang Zhen’s striking looks.

“Fear not!” Wang Zhen declared. “When I ascend, I’ll gift you each harem members! No more lonely nights with your right hand!”

Niu Le blinked blankly at the innuendo.

“Enough!” Guan Yu cut in. “Since we’re all checked in, let’s feast! My treat.”

“Nonsense!” Tian Hao thumped his chest. “I’m local—my family owns a diner. My hospitality!”

After heated debate, they relented. The group headed to Tian’s eatery, Wang Zhen ogling every passing coed.

“That waist! Divine!”

“Perfect legs—just right for shoulder-riding. Mouthwatering...”

“Have some dignity!” Guan Yu hissed. “Must you drool so?”

“Direct appreciation flatters them!” Wang Zhen adjusted his shades. “They pretend disdain, but inwardly preen. Charisma 101, my friend!”

Strangely, Guan Yu found logic in this.

At the diner, Tian’s father gaped upon recognizing Guan Yu and Niu Le. Before greetings concluded, drunk patrons banged tables.

“Old Tian! Our chicken dish? We’ll finish drinking before it arrives!”

A scarred bald man sneered, “Can’t afford staff? Pathetic.”

**Chapter 98: Playing Hero?**

As tensions rose, Tian Hao trembled with rage. Niu Le’s hand crept toward his blade-filled satchel.

“Don’t!” Guan Yu restrained both. Approaching the rowdy table, he smiled disarmingly.

“Gentlemen enjoying yourselves?”

“Who’re you?” The scarred man (Li Quezi) glared.

“Just diners. My friend here’s the owner’s son. Thought we’d pay respects to local luminaries.”

“Here to fight his battles?” Li Quezi brandished a bottle.

“Merely observing. Small businesses struggle...”

CRASH!

The bottle shattered mid-swing as Guan Yu intercepted with his own. Shards flew as he slammed a plate into Li Quezi’s face.

**Chapter 99: Coming for You**

Chaos erupted. Niu Le’s blade flashed crimson while Tian Hao pummeled others. Soon, four thugs cowered beneath tables.

“Who wants more?” Niu Le growled, blood dripping from his cleaver.

Guan Yu hauled two beer crates forward. BOTTLE after BOTTLE exploded on skulls until the floor swam with blood and groans.

“Want free meals?” He loomed over the whimpering mob. “Let’s see you digest glass!”
