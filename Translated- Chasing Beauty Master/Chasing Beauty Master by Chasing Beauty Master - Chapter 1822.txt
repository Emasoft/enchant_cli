The host on stage smiled cheerfully and announced, "The current highest bid belongs to Eldest Miss Jiang at twenty-seven thousand taels. This black gemstone might well be the only one of its kind in the entire martial world. While this price isn't exorbitant, does anyone else wish to bid?"

Hei Doufeng (Black Bean Wind) remained motionless in his seat, the hooded figure merely shaking his hidden head in apparent surrender.

Eldest Miss Jiang's mood lifted slightly. Though spending such fortune on the gemstone wasn't truly worthwhile, she couldn't back down after declaring her intention to present it to the Emperor. For the Jiang family, twenty-seven thousand taels was but petty cash - easily spent without second thought.

Resuming her seat beside Chu Fan, Eldest Miss Jiang awaited the auctioneer's hammer. She envisioned playing with the gemstone for days before gifting it to the imperial palace.

"Thirty thousand taels!"

The sudden bid froze the hall. Just as the auctioneer prepared to finalize the sale after three calls, Guan Yu raised his hand from the sidelines, his voice slicing through the silence with a three-thousand-tael leap.

Though needing funds for the upcoming Red Charm Theater purchase, Guan Yu couldn't pass this opportunity. Acquiring the gemstone at thirty thousand meant guaranteed profit through Xuan Ming's connections later. The theater could wait - this unique treasure wouldn't reappear.

All eyes turned to Guan Yu. The hooded figure stood abruptly, while Eldest Miss Jiang and Chu Fan rose in unison. The auctioneer gaped momentarily before murmuring, "Truly, dragons and tigers hide among today's crowd. This treasure proves its worth."

Guan Yu ignored the stares, focusing on the enigmatic hooded bidder. Sunlight revealed only a clean-shaven chin beneath the shadowed cowl - likely a young man, Guan Yu surmised.

The hooded figure's gaze burned with apparent astonishment. The hall buzzed with whispers, many speculating this challenger courted disaster by provoking Eldest Miss Jiang.

"What's your meaning?" Eldest Miss Jiang snapped, irritation flashing across her features. "Must troublesome flies swarm today?"

Chapter 4768: Extraordinary Status

The hooded bidder's hidden face twisted in frustration. Having liquidated all assets yet still outmatched by Jiang's resources, he'd resigned himself to defeat before this new contender emerged.

Few beyond cultivators recognized the gemstone's true value - else bidding would have soared higher from the start.

"Since when does this house forbid legitimate bids?" Guan Yu retorted, ignoring hostile glares. "I pursue what I can afford. Why the commotion over honest commerce?"

Recovering his professional demeanor, the auctioneer boomed, "Thirty thousand taels! The new highest bid! Does Eldest Miss Jiang wish to counter?"

The auction house cared not for status - highest bidder prevailed, imperial connections notwithstanding. Earlier, management had contemplated planting a false bidder to drive up Jiang's offer, but feared retracting from the influential maiden.

They'd assumed twenty-seven thousand would seal the deal until Guan Yu's intervention. The auctioneer's darting eyes initially suspected house subterfuge before confirming the genuine bid.

A neighboring bidder nudged Guan Yu, whispering, "You're new here, yes? Antagonizing Eldest Miss Jiang invites trouble. Her mother is the Emperor's eldest princess, her father Jiang Yuankai - peerless martial master and merchant magnate. Their union blends court and martial world power."

Guan Yu recalled Jiang Yuankai's legend - among few survivors of Wujian Villa's challenges, though his duel with the Sword Immortal remained shrouded. The martial-commercial titan dominated ventures unchallenged.

"So the Emperor is her grandfather?" Guan Yu murmured. "No wonder none dare oppose her."

"Precisely. As for Chu Fan..." The informant lowered his voice, "A popular entertainer, though some call him a kept man riding Jiang's coattails to imperial favor."

Their hushed conversation halted as Eldest Miss Jiang pointed imperiously at Guan Yu. "Well? Are you deaf? State your purpose!"

Guan Yu offered a conciliatory bow. "My apologies, esteemed lady. This gemstone holds great import for me. Might you graciously concede?"

"Concede?" Her laugh rang cold. "I declared this for His Majesty. Others yielded - why must you persist?"

Guan Yu maintained deference, sensing the danger of antagonizing this power. "I seek no conflict, only this long-sought treasure. Even our hooded friend here would continue if means allowed." He gestured to the silent figure, receiving tacit confirmation through the cowled nod.

Eldest Miss Jiang's eyes narrowed. "You presume I yield easily?"

Chapter 4769: Unrelenting Pursuit

To Guan Yu's surprise, the heiress showed restraint despite her capacity for force. Her cultivated demeanor contrasted expectations of spoiled tyranny. "Very well," she declared, voice ringing clear. "Let's see whose coffers run deeper in the capital. Thirty-five thousand!"

The five-thousand-tael jump drew gasps. The auctioneer practically glowed, envisioning his commission. "Magnificent! Thirty-five thousand! Any further bids?"

Guan Yu hesitated. Escalating this duel only enriched the house while deepening Jiang's ire. Yet abandoning the gemstone meant losing Xuan Ming's lucrative exchange.

An idea crystallized. Signaling for pause, Guan Yu produced an egg-sized luminous pearl from his robes - the translucent orb glowing with inner light, its golden filigree shimmering. The crowd's collective breath caught.

"Is that... the East Sea Dragon Pearl?" someone whispered awedly.

Another voice revived ancient lore: "Thirty years past, Alliance Leader Dai Xiaotian's lover Lady Qiao possessed such a treasure. They say she was an ocean princess! When demonic hordes abducted her, Dai fell defending her, both lost to the waves..."

Guan Yu's plan shifted as legends unfolded around his unintended treasure. Meant as peace offering, the pearl's revealed history gave pause. Yet Eldest Miss Jiang's eyes glittered with desire.

Chapter 4770: Legend Reborn

Murmurs swelled as veterans recounted the tragic romance. Guan Yu stood at crossroads - sacrifice a legendary artifact for alliance, or guard this unexpected windfall. The pearl's glow pulsed like a heartbeat, its destiny intertwining with the gemstone's fate as two powerful wills clashed in the auction hall.
