“You should wash your hands first. There might be band-aids in the drawer,” Liu Shilei said while rummaging through it.

Crouching before the washbasin to rinse bloodstains from his hands, Guan Yu ignored Liu Shilei beside him.

“Serves you right, you pervert! Karma’s a bitch!” Mo Ling whispered挑衅ly, squatting before Guan Yu with wide, glaring eyes while Liu Shilei’s back was turned.

“Who’s a pervert? Stop spouting nonsense—it was a misunderstanding!” Guan Yu flushed red, hissing urgently under his breath.

“You dare deny it? What were you staring at when I walked in earlier? You peeped on me in the bathroom—admit it!” Mo Ling puffed her cheeks, eyes blazing as she kept her voice low.

“I—” Guan Yu began to explain, but Mo Ling jabbed a slender finger at his nose, her doe-like eyes threatening. “Keep talking? Go on! You’re a pervert, and that’s that! Say another word!”

Overwhelmed by this feisty girl’s antics, Guan Yu grimaced at her triumphant smirk. After huffing impatiently, he glanced at Liu Shilei. Seeing her distracted, he suddenly snapped his teeth toward Mo Ling’s index finger.

**Chapter Eight: The Gravity System**

Caught off guard, Mo Ling never expected Guan Yu to bite her finger. He clamped down firmly.

“Mmph…!” Mo Ling’s face paled with rage. She wrinkled her nose, shooting Guan Yu a venomous glare.

Guan Yu looked equally wronged. Who knew she’d react so slowly? He’d deliberately opened his mouth first before leaning in—yet she still hadn’t dodged!

“Are you a dog or something?!” Mo Ling hissed, cheeks puffing.

Clenching her finger between his teeth, Guan Yu blinked blankly. The sensation felt awkward—especially with such a delicate, bubble-like beauty before him.

As stray thoughts flickered through his mind, his tongue reflexively flicked against the tip of her slender finger.

Mo Ling’s face instantly flushed crimson. She glared, yanking her finger free by prying his lips apart.

“Pervert… still denying it!” She grumbled, examining the tooth marks on her finger before shooting him a withering look. Just as she moved to wipe her finger on her clothes, she paused.

With a disdainful sniff, Mo Ling instead wiped her hand on Guan Yu’s shirtfront.

Liu Shilei handed Guan Yu a band-aid, puzzled. “What were you two whispering about?”

“As if I’d chat with him! Jerk!” Mo Ling huffed, standing abruptly.

Liu Shilei glanced between them, baffled by their antagonism. Clearly, Mo Ling held a grudge against Guan Yu.

“Thanks, sister-in-law!” Guan Yu said casually.

“Sister-in-law?” Mo Ling gaped at Liu Shilei. “Shilei-jie, when did you… get a boyfriend?”

“It’s not like that—” Liu Shilei blushed, leaning to whisper解释ly into Mo Ling’s ear.

“Oh…” Mo Ling nodded in sudden understanding, eyeing Guan Yu up and down before curling her lip.

“How many times must I say it? Just call me ‘jie’!” Liu Shilei reminded Guan Yu with a wry smile.

Guan Yu awkwardly rubbed his nose and sat down.

“Jie… could you take me to the school guesthouse? Or just tell me how to get there?”

“No rush. Play on the computer awhile. We’ll go after dinner.” Liu Shilei beckoned Mo Ling, and the two bustled to the makeshift kitchen behind the door.

The simple setup—a foldable table, miniature gas tank, and rice cooker—was surprisingly complete.

While chopping vegetables, Liu Shilei called over her shoulder, “If the cafeteria’s noodles don’t suit you after school starts, join us here for meals. One more bowl won’t matter.”

“That’s… unnecessary,” Guan Yu quickly declined.

Liu Shilei chuckled, shooting him a look before falling silent—perhaps it was mere politeness, Guan Yu mused.

Booting up the computer, his mind wandered. That gold-like coin had vanished before his eyes without a trace. Utterly unscientific… His puzzled gaze swept the room before he scratched his head in bewilderment.

Scrolling through campus forums, he skimmed posts ranging from gossip to confession threads. Suddenly, a viral post caught his eye: “50-Year Prediction: Human Flight Is Possible,” with over a hundred replies.

Flight? Intrigued, Guan Yu clicked in. The lengthy thesis discussed maglev train principles, proposing specialized magnetic “hover shoes” for gliding along fixed tracks. The post concluded with contact details for partnership offers.

Guan Yu dismissed it as fantasy—not true flight, just magnetic resistance against gravity. Still… the idea of reduced gravity enabling moon-like leaps intrigued him. Imagine enhanced agility in combat! His fingers snapped excitedly at the thought.

**Chapter Nine: Aunt Flo’s Leak?**

The moment his fingers snapped, golden light flashed through his mind, flooding it with cryptic symbols.

Terrifyingly, his body froze. Five seconds later, normality returned.

*Gravity System installation complete! Level 1: ±0.2g adjustment capacity. Self-enhancement: 50%...* Guan Yu stared dumbfounded. These words—unbidden—burned in his consciousness like screen text.

Gravity manipulation? Sweat dripped down his temples as he gripped the mouse, petrified. Was he hallucinating?

The earlier coin’s disappearance… now this. Trembling, he glanced at the oblivious women cooking. Had his own thoughts triggered this?

Licking dry lips, Guan Yu tentatively stood. *Increase gravity… decrease gravity.* Nothing happened.

Crushed, he slumped back. A sleep-deprived hallucination, then. Yet the copper coin’s physical absence gnawed at him—he’d cut his palm scrubbing it!

“Dinner’s ready!” Liu Shilei called.

As Guan Yu mechanically ate, Mo Ling chirped, “I’ve got hawthorn juice in my room!” She returned struggling with a stubborn bottle cap.

Guan Yu reached over. “Let me.”

“Hmph!” Mo Ling relinquished it reluctantly. “Stupid tight cap!”

“Can’t even open this? So frustrating?” Guan Yu smirked, twisting it open effortlessly.

Suddenly, his body stiffened. Golden light exploded in his mind—the Gravity System interface materialized on a giant copper coin’s surface, its square hole labeled “Confirm.”

*Did my words activate it? ‘Open’… ‘frustrate’… ‘activate’?!*

*Crack!* The glass shattered in his tightening grip, blood and juice mingling on his palm.

“Ah!” Mo Ling screamed, scrambling behind Liu Shilei.

“What were you thinking?!” Liu Shilei scolded, fetching water. Guan Yu stared dumbly at his bleeding hand—and the red stain spreading down his thigh like menstrual leakage.

**Chapter Ten: The Gynecologist’s Bliss**

“Go to the clinic!” Liu Shilei urged, eyeing his bloody pants.

Mo Ling trailed behind, taunting, “I want to see him squeal in pain!”

Walking behind Liu Shilei, Guan Yu’s gaze involuntarily dropped to her swaying hips before darting to Mo Ling’s bust, nearly bursting her sportswear.

“Eyes to yourself!” Mo Ling pinched his arm.

Guan Yu inhaled her natural fragrance—intoxicating, unlike any perfume.

“Apologize, or worse luck’s coming!” Mo Ling threatened.

Guan Yu smirked. Misfortune? He’d gained an incredible power. If only he could test it…

“My bad luck probably comes from seeing something unclean,” he retorted暗示ly.

“You—!” Mo Ling raised a fist, only halted by Liu Shilei’s intervention.

As they headed out, Guan Yu’s resolve solidified. This Gravity System—real or hallucination—would change everything.
