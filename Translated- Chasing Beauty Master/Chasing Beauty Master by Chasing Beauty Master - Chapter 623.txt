“Asura, let me bandage your wound!” Mu Bai appeared beside Guan Yu at some point, staring intently at her injury. In that moment, he seemed to forget about Ming Hanfeng standing before her, addressing Guan Yu with solemn gravity.

Guan Yu turned, her gaze lingering on the medical kit in his hands. So his earlier departure had been to fetch supplies. A flicker of gratitude stirred within her. “Your Highness, I have matters to attend. Forgive my absence.” Her voice cooled as she regarded Ming Hanfeng, her frigid demeanor reasserting itself like winter frost.

“Let’s go.” She pivoted to leave. Mu Bai rushed forward to support her, but she brushed him aside—unaccustomed to others’ aid, as always. Helpless, he watched her limping figure retreat. Yet as she passed Ye Wuhen, Guan Yu paused abruptly. “I owe you a debt. One day, I shall repay it.”

A knowing smile curled Ye Wuhen’s lips. *Repay me? Excellent. I’ll await that day.*

Mu Fengchen observed the distant petite silhouette, an intuition flaring—this girl’s arrival would stir tempests across the continent. Upon returning to the City Lord’s residence, Guan Yu was startled by Hu Xiaohai’s abrupt announcement: he would enter seclusion to ascend to Heavenly Sovereign. Though pleased for him, a thread of envy snaked through her. *Why does he reach Heavenly Sovereign through slumber while I grind day and night?*

**Chapter 1583: The Risk**

Guan Yu’s battle had truly immortalized her. The name “Asura” spread like wildfire—a twelve-year-old Saint Sovereign, a genius eclipsing even the foremost prodigy Ye Wuhen. How could such brilliance escape notice?

Overnight, “Asura” became household knowledge in Mu Feng City. That evening, a banquet celebrated the city’s defense. Guan Yu stood alone atop the residence’s roof, gazing into the distance. She’d declined attendance; Mu Bai insisted her fractured right leg required rest. In truth, potent light-element healing had nearly mended it—only avoiding forceful kicks remained necessary. To her, feasts meant pointless bother.

Even if she claimed recovery, none would believe it. A shadow flickered beside her. Her brow furrowed—she’d sensed surveillance for hours, though devoid of malice. To her, only enemies warranted attention.

The watcher materialized behind her, reclining lazily on the tiles. “When did you notice me?”

Guan Yu ignored the question, sparing him a sidelong glance devoid of prior contempt before vanishing.

Ye Wuhen stared at her leg, baffled. *Uninjured? Impossible.* He pursued, matching her stride. “Your leg—”

“Are you idle?” she snapped, halting to spear him with vermilion eyes.

His lips twitched in amusement. When had anyone ever dismissed him so? *How intriguing.* “I’m quite busy. Don’t deflect—explain your leg.”

“If I say it’s healed, would you believe it?”

His pause lasted mere heartbeats. “Yes.”

Her mask hid most of her face, but the barest quirk of her lips betrayed a smile. “Then why question my name?” Ye Wuhen pressed. “‘Asura’ hardly suits a girl.”

Her gaze darkened. “Asura *is* my name.” She spun away—this man radiated danger.

“Is this how you treat your savior?” he called after her.

“I needed no help to kill it!” Her pace quickened, though her icy retort trailed back: “Should fate decree, I’ll save you once. Then we’re even.”

Baffled, Ye Wuhen sighed. *Women—so mercurial.*

Next morning, as Ming Hanfeng’s group prepared to depart with Mu Bai and Guan Yu, chaos erupted at the gates.

“Look! The twelve-year-old Saint Sovereign!”

“Monstrous talent! At twelve I hadn’t reached Spirit Sovereign!”

“Heaven spawns freaks now!”

The crowd’s cacophony darkened Guan Yu’s expression—a gathering storm. *This fame will haunt me. If Akali learns of ‘Asura’...*

Mu Bai dragged her through the throng, but Ye Wuhen and Ming Hanfeng attracted their own admirers.

“It’s Prince Wuhen and Lord Hanfeng!”

“A single glance from them would be worth dying for!”

The men exchanged panicked looks. “Retreat!” they chorused, fleeing—a rare unity against fangirls.

From the ramparts, Mu Fengchen chuckled. *The world shall soon be theirs.*

**Chapter 1584: Potential**

Traveling westward on horned steeds, danger struck without warning.

Ming Hanfeng halted the convoy. “Show yourselves!”

Understanding dawned—they’d been tracked. Tension thickened until a scream pierced the air. A burly man beside Guan Yu collapsed, throat slit.

She observed indifferently. “Others’ lives concern me not,” she told Mu Bai’s questioning stare.

“How callous,” Ye Wuhen murmured. “Fascinating.”

As Earth Sovereigns fell, Ming Hanfeng nodded to Bing Su. Dark energy erupted, flushing out a dozen black-clad assassins.

Their leader sneered. “Futile resistance!” His gaze froze under the group’s glares—then widened at Guan Yu. “A child? Die first!”

Lightning crackled toward her. She sidestepped, the blast cratering ground behind. Calmly, she wove foliage into a verdant sphere, hurling it with a leaf-chain escort. The leader staggered back, stunned. *A Saint Sovereign child? Impossible!*

Murmurs rippled. She’d repelled a mid-tier Saint Sovereign! *Monster or mortal?*

Noticing dissent among attackers, Guan Yu joined the fray. Ye Wuhen scowled. *Who wants me dead so badly?*

“Your enemies multiply,” Ming Hanfeng remarked mid-combat.

“Beauty invites jealousy,” Ye Wuhen sighed theatrically, earning an eyeroll.

Meanwhile, Mu Bai grappled with helplessness until Guan Yu appeared beside him. “Self-pity wastes time. Train harder.”

Gratitude flooded him as she vanished again.

Guan Yu cornered the assassin leader, strikes lethal and precise. “Who *are* you?” he gasped before falling.

Surveying carnage, she announced, “All gatherings end. We part here.”

“But you’re bound for the capital!” Mu Bai protested.

“I’ll return after handling affairs.”

“We could assist,” Ye Wuhen insisted, surprising himself.

“Your help is unnecessary.” Wind swirled as she departed, leaving three men nursing unnamed emotions.

**Chapter 1585: Slaying the Abomination**

Hours later, Guan Yu reappeared at the battlefield, hauling a corpse into a cave. Removing the mask revealed astonishing beauty—a face rivaling Ye Wuhen’s.

Channeling light energy, she healed his fatal wounds.

When Ling Tian awoke, confusion reigned. “Hell’s... austere.”

“You live,” Guan Yu stated, eyes closed in meditation.

He jolted. “You saved me? Why?”

“Yes.”

His healed body defied logic. “Who *are* you?”

“Your question holds no meaning.” Her tone brooked no argument, yet Ling Tian sensed destiny intertwining with this enigma clad in crimson.
