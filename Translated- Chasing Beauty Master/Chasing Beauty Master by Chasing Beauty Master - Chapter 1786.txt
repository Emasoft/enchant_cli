“At this point,” Guan Yu also stood up and continued, “If not for Xiaomei’s assistance, we might have perished entirely during a storm. Without her help, we would never have found Miao City so smoothly. In that sense, she is a benefactor to our Yunqing Sect. To a benefactor, we naturally owe gracious hospitality. However, Aunt Right Envoy must not misunderstand—we are not ‘mingling’ with her. We merely traveled together, sharing the same path.”

The Right Envoy nodded, finally understanding the situation. Earlier, she had truly believed this girl was one of the demon practitioners from Miao City, intent on slandering the Yunqing Sect. She hadn’t expected such a relationship.

The Right Envoy didn’t dwell on it. After all, their Demon Soul Sect had no shortage of demon practitioners themselves; this was nothing particularly unusual.

“So that’s how it is,” the Right Envoy sneered. “I thought you righteous sect disciples slaughtered demon practitioners on sight. Yet you’ve benefited from their kindness. How amusing.” Her tone carried icy mockery, though she had no intention of causing trouble for Guan Yu over this—nor could she, even if she tried.

Xiaomei, reading the tension in Guan Yu’s gaze, remained silent and subdued. Had this been in the past, her temper would have flared, and she’d have risen to curse the Right Envoy outright.

But circumstances and location differed now. Though Xiaomei retained a girlish willfulness, she understood the gravity of the situation. Not wanting to burden Guan Yu, she swallowed her pride. Knowing the Right Envoy hailed from the Demon Soul Sect, she dared not provoke further conflict.

**Chapter 4672: Honesty**

Xiaomei grasped the stakes. Guan Yu wasn’t afraid of the Demon Soul Sect but wished to avoid unnecessary strife. However, if the Right Envoy deliberately stirred trouble or escalated matters, Guan Yu would not let it pass.

“Aunt Right Envoy overthink things,” Guan Yu said with a strained smile, shifting the topic. “Your Demon Soul Sect must have endured hardships on this journey as well. Countless sects ventured into the desert seeking Miao City, only to return empty-handed. What a farce.”

“A farce, perhaps,” the Right Envoy replied coolly, “but one I anticipated. Miao City’s complexities ensured our failure. Yet we didn’t return entirely empty-handed—we gleaned some information.”

She referred to the cryptic phrases that had materialized in the secret chamber. Guan Yu deeply contemplated this. The late Patriarch Menghua had clearly left this grand riddle to sow chaos in the martial world.

Every cultivator or sect would covet the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Once word spread, they would flock to seek it, inevitably clashing in bloody skirmishes along the way. Guan Yu believed Menghua’s scheme was deliberate. Now, with those phrases revealed, sects would surge toward the capital, drawn by rumors of the technique’s whereabouts.

Guan Yu knew he’d be dispatched to the capital by the Xuanming Sect upon his return—or he’d find an excuse to go himself. His hunger to obtain the Eight-Sided Drum Technique surpassed all others.

With feigned humility, Guan Yu asked, “True, but the losses we suffered in the desert—the hardships only we understand—yielded mere words. It feels... unjust.”

“Why dwell on bitterness?” The Right Envoy smiled, glancing oddly at Xiaomei. “Consider it a trial by fire in the desert.” Guan Yu noted her peculiar look but couldn’t decipher its meaning.

He pressed further, “Aunt Right Envoy, regarding those phrases in the chamber—do you have insights to share?”

Noting her hesitation, Guan Yu added, “Setting aside our allegiances, aren’t we on familiar terms? If you have wisdom to impart, surely you wouldn’t withhold it from a junior?”

“My people are ready. We depart now.” The Right Envoy rose abruptly. “Our next meeting may be in the capital.” Though she harbored thoughts, she refused to divulge them. Trapped by Guan Yu’s respectful inquiry, she opted for retreat.

After the Demon Soul Sect’s departure, Guan Yu sat back down, sneering. The Right Envoy was likely the sect’s most formidable figure—sharp and cunning. His earlier questioning had aimed to drive her away, as her prolonged presence boded ill.

Yet she had complied, leaving Guan Yu puzzled. Was she deliberately sparing him? Had she exploited Xiaomei’s identity as a demon practitioner, Guan Yu’s position—and the Yunqing Sect’s reputation—would have crumbled. Perhaps she relented out of regard for Wang Xiaorong, Guan Yu’s connection.

The Demon Soul Sect, though infamous for cruelty, housed figures like the Right Envoy who weren’t inherently evil—nor were they saints. They embraced their ruthless reputation, resolving conflicts through force.

**Chapter 4673: A Noble Lady**

Once alone, Xiaomei demanded, “Guan Yu, how did that vile woman know my identity?”

“It’s no mystery,” Guan Yu replied. “The Right Envoy is the Demon Soul Sect’s second-in-command. To someone of her prowess, your aura is unmistakable—unless concealed by extraordinary means.”

“So she’s stronger than you?” Xiaomei gasped, relieved she’d restrained herself earlier.

“We’ve never crossed blades,” Guan Yu admitted frankly. “In a duel, I might not prevail, but defeating me wouldn’t come easily. Escaping her, however, would be simple.” Without his hand crossbow or Desert Eagle, he’d rely on evasion.

Xiaomei teased, “Since when are you so humble? The Guan Yu I know doesn’t downplay his skills!”

“I’m a novice cultivator,” he chuckled. “Against a seasoned expert like her, defeat is expected. No false pride here.”

Eager for distraction, Xiaomei dragged Guan Yu to a martial tournament for marriage in the bustling streets. Reluctantly, he accompanied her, followed by the ever-watchful Siqi.

A circular stage dominated the town square, swarmed by onlookers. The wealthy Dong family’s daughter sought a suitor through combat, offering gifts to the crowd. Vendors abandoned stalls to join the spectacle.

Guan Yu secured a vantage point. Whispers praised the Dong heiress’s beauty and fortune—a prize promising boundless wealth and a peerless bride.

“Why would a noble lady resort to this?” Guan Yu mused. “With her status, finding a match should be effortless.”

An elderly steward, bent with age, hobbled onto the stage. “The rules are simple,” he wheezed. “Defeat our young mistress and seize the red silk ball atop the pillar to claim her hand.”

As attendants showered the crowd with trinkets, gold, and silver, Xiaomei snatched a golden hairpin. “The Dongs are extravagant!” she marveled.

A white-clad beauty ascended the stage—tall, poised, with piercing eyes and a slender sword. The crowd erupted. Atop a five-meter pillar hung the crimson silk ball, the contest’s objective.

A young scholar floated onto the stage with refined qinggong, wielding an awkwardly held fan. The Dong maiden attacked without mercy, her blade a silver blur.

**Chapter 4674: A Master**

The scholar parried clumsily, clearly unaccustomed to the fan. The lady’s strikes were relentless, her skill evident. Guan Yu observed dispassionately. “Predictable. He’s outmatched.”

Xiaomei nudged him. “Aren’t you tempted to try? Imagine winning such a bride!”

Guan Yu snorted. “I’ve no interest in theatrics. Let fools play their games.”

Yet as the duel unfolded, a shadow flickered at the stage’s edge—a figure cloaked in black, observing with keen interest. Guan Yu’s instincts prickled. This tournament held deeper currents than mere matrimony...
