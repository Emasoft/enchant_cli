“Tsk, when has my judgment ever been off?” Guan Yu said disdainfully. “That girl seems to be in a bit of trouble, being subjected to the boss’s under-the-table rules. Xiao Dongzi, your chance has come.”

Guan Yu winked suggestively while egging him on.

“Hmm, I know.”

“You know? Could it be that you…” Guan Yu wisely shut his mouth mid-sentence. Their table was far from the girl – he’d only learned about her predicament through surveillance systems, yet Lin Dong somehow knew too.

“Tsk, nothing to be surprised about. You’re not the only one who knows lip-reading,” Lin Dong scoffed.

“Oh, so it’s lip-reading! Scared the hell out of me.” Guan Yu sighed, feeling overly paranoid.

“Since you know, why not act? Chances like this are rare – seize it before it’s gone!” Guan Yu urged, trying to divert attention from his nervousness.

“Not interested. She’s too innocent – not my type,” Lin Dong turned away coolly.

“Oho~” Guan Yu’s drawn-out exclamation carried mock surprise as he leaned in with a lecherous grin. “Never noticed you preferred mature women, Xiao Dongzi! Should I find you someone who likes whips and candles?”

Lin Dong glared disdainfully. “At least I’m loyal, unlike your philandering ways. This pure type suits your taste. How can you let that creep harm her?”

“I’m already dealing with drama at home. No more fires,” Guan Yu shrugged.

“Coward,” Lin Dong sneered.

Red-faced, Guan Yu changed topics. “Let’s hear what’s happening. As upstanding citizens, we can’t ignore a damsel in distress.”

Some fates are predestined.

“Xiao Ya, have you considered my proposal?” A pot-bellied middle-aged man grasped Wenya’s hand lustfully when his wife wasn’t around.

“Ah!” Startled, Wenya dropped a plate. “The老板娘 will scold me again!”

“Nonsense! I decide punishments here,” the boss blustered.

Wenya scoffed internally – this coward only acted tough when his wife was absent.

“I’ll clean up,” she sighed.

“Xiao Ya, my offer stands. Marry me, and I’ll fund your tuition,” the boss leered.

Wenya feigned ignorance until tricking him with a false alarm about his wife’s arrival.

When the老板娘 arrived, the boss falsely accused Wenya of seduction and breaking dishes. The老板娘 raged: “This little slut! Firing’s too good – dock her pay!”

Wenya paled with anger but remained silent until a stranger intervened.

“Shut your foul mouth, hag! Your husband’s the predator here!” Guan Yu stepped in protectively.

Chaos erupted as the couple turned on each other, driving customers away. Guan宇 left with Wenya, only for her to angrily storm off, blaming him for her job loss.

Guan宇 sought solace with温情, lamenting how his goodwill backfired. “This world punishes do-gooders!”

温情 teased: “You cost that girl her job – hardly heroic!”

Meanwhile, Wenya wandered the streets, despairing over lost income for her studies and mother’s medical bills.

“More headaches await,”温情 warned as Guan宇 groaned. “What now?”

“You’ll see,” she said cryptically, leaving him to face new challenges.
