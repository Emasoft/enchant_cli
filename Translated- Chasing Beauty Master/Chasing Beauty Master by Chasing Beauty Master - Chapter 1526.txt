When Xiao Zhi learned that Elder Xiang and Elder Lu had gone together one day, he realized his turning point had arrived. If he could endure through it, he would finally live like a normal person. Despite the dangers, Xiao Zhi summoned his courage and persevered. Now, everything had settled.

Back then, Elder Lu had given him immense courage. Moreover, Xiao Zhi knew his parents were waiting for him at home. Even if death loomed, he vowed to cling to his last breath to see them again.

**Chapter 3957: Remember What I Said**

Guanyu handed the letter from Xuanming to Xiao Zhi. “Read this. Xuanming is sending us out to protect this man on his journey to the capital. What do you think?”

Xiao Zhi took the letter and frowned. “Since when do we have ties with the government? This makes no sense. Are you pulling my leg? How could the Sect Leader assign such a task?”

“Why would I lie? Xuanming gave me this letter himself. I’m puzzled too, but it’s fine. With no urgent matters here, we’ll treat it as an excursion.”

As Guanyu finished speaking, Elder Zheng entered. The group bowed respectfully. Elder Zheng waved his hand. “Guanyu, no need for formalities. To be honest, I’m uneasy about Xiao Zhi accompanying you. Don’t misunderstand—I trust your capabilities. But Xiao Zhi has only just recovered. I fear the journey’s hardships may overwhelm him.”

Guanyu nodded. “Your concern is natural. But rest assured, Elder Zheng. This expedition will be excellent training for Xiao Zhi. You know his body still harbors unabsorbed spiritual energy. Seizing this opportunity to refine it through real-world experience is ideal.”

Elder Zheng sighed. “Guanyu, I trust you. Please watch over him. He lacks worldly experience and is easily deceived. I must rely on you.”

“Father, enough! With Guanyu here, I’ll be safe. Stop worrying,” Xiao Zhi grumbled.

Elder Zheng had initially opposed the trip, haunted by the recent near-disaster. Though Xiao Zhi had escaped harm, threats might still lurk. Surviving once was luck; a second chance was unlikely. He had even approached Xuanming, only to learn Guanyu had personally requested Xiao Zhi’s company.

Resigned, Elder Zheng conceded. Guanyu’s logic was sound, and since Guanyu had saved Xiao Zhi’s life, he trusted his judgment.

Guanyu smiled. “Your worry is understandable, Elder Zheng. But if Xiao Zhi stays close and follows orders, I’ll return him safely.”

“Your word comforts me. May your journey be smooth. The outside world holds more promise than these mountain halls.”

Xiao Zhi added, “Father, don’t tell Mother. Say I’m staying with Guanyu at Tiger’s Peak.”

“She already knows. How could she not inquire? Just send word occasionally to ease her mind. Last time, you ignored Guanyu’s advice and nearly died. This time, consult him on everything. Understood?”

“I know. I’ve always admired Guanyu. I’ll remember.”

Wang Jun approached, holding a black ingot. “Take this back. You left it with me, but it’ll serve you better now.”

Xiao Zhi chuckled. “Fair enough. It’s just a trinket I invented. The other half is with Father—useless to others. With this, I can send messages anytime.”

After further farewells, Elder Zheng reiterated his plea for Guanyu’s vigilance. Though reluctant to let Xiao Zhi go, he knew resistance was futile. After long confinement at Bamboo Peak, the youth deserved fresh air.

Guanyu asked, “Elder Zheng, who is Prince Zou? Our first task is escorting him to the capital.”

“Ah, the Sect Leader assigned this?” Elder Zheng took the letter. “It seems turmoil brews in the royal court. Be cautious. Protect the Prince at all costs.”

Xiao Zhi frowned. “We’re the foremost righteous sect. Why meddle with the government? A prince’s fate shouldn’t concern us. Other sects will resent this. Should we proceed?”

Elder Zheng sighed. “There’s a connection. Normally, this stays secret, but since we’ve broached it… Prince Zou was once of Yunqing Sect. Decades ago, while on a mission, he saved a man who turned out to be the Emperor.

“During an incognito tour, the Emperor faced assassination. Zou rescued him, and upon revealing identities, the Emperor granted him a princedom and fief in Liaozhou.

“Years passed without contact. Now, the Emperor, aged and bedridden, summons him—likely to name an heir. With two unpopular princes, perhaps Zou is the unexpected successor.”

Guanyu grasped the stakes. The princes would view Zou as a threat, ensuring perilous roads ahead.

**Chapter 3958: Don’t Act Recklessly**

The rivals wouldn’t let Zou reach the capital easily. Power struggles were familiar to Guanyu. Alternatively, the Emperor might simply wish to bid farewell to his savior. Either way, danger loomed.

Guanyu asked, “Even if Zou was once of Yunqing, he’s now a prince. Isn’t our protection improper?”

Elder Zheng sighed. “Necessity compels us. The assassins will be hired blades. Conceal your identities, and no issue arises.”

Wang Jun grinned. “Court intrigues mixed with jianghu—how thrilling!”

“The Emperor’s ailing. The elder prince, though educated, lacks wit and favor. The younger, clever but wayward, rejects tutelage. The Emperor’s hands are tied, hence summoning Zou.”

Guanyu nodded. “So the princes likely sent the assassins. Palace factions must be scrambling.”

“Indeed. The younger prince’s mother, Consort Lin, has court allies. Factions thrive under the Emperor’s tacit tolerance—for now.”

Xiao Zhi vowed, “We’ll protect him fiercely.”

“Prioritize your safety,” Elder Zheng warned. “Act wisely, not rashly.”

Guanyu asked, “Elder Zheng, if Prince Zou was your junior brother and once saved the Emperor, shouldn’t his cultivation be formidable? Why need us?”

“Zou abandoned cultivation upon becoming prince. His current skills pale next to yours.”

Guanyu smirked. “Xiao Zhi’s refining his spiritual energy. These assassins will be perfect practice.”

Xiao Zhi laughed. “With you here, I fear nothing.”

Elder Zheng rose. “Dawn approaches. Gather your belongings. I’ll escort you to Front Return Peak.” His gaze lingered on Xiao Zhi—reluctant, yet resigned.

Wang Jun teased, “Had you listened to Guanyu last time, you’d have spared yourself agony.”

“My fault for trusting the wrong people,” Xiao Zhi sighed.

Prepared, the trio departed. Wang Jun carried a crossbow, drawing curious glances. At Front Return Peak, Elder Lu greeted them. “Xiao Zhi, your recovery gladdens me. Survival foretells greatness.”

“Thank you, Elder Lu, for your care.”

Elder Zheng bowed. “Elder Lu, your faith saved him. I’m indebted.”

“Xiao Zhi’s integrity was clear. I trusted him.” Elder Lu turned. “Depart swiftly. Your task is grave.”

Guanyu grinned. “Elder Lu, no gold leaves this time?”

“Rascal! My coffers are bare. Besides, Elder Zheng surely provisioned you.”

Under their elders’ gaze, the trio rode off on swift steeds. Prince Zou’s party, two days from Liaozhou, neared Lianzhou.

**Chapter 3959: Night Fog**

Prince Zou had written to Xuanming days prior, requesting protection, yet received no reply. The previous night, assassins had struck, thinning his guards. His three adopted children—Zou Wuya, Zou Wuxiao, and Zou Wuhui—remained loyal.

As dusk fell, the convoy entered a fog-shrouded bamboo forest. Captain Gang advised retreat, but Zou insisted on scouting ahead. A scout returned: “Three miles ahead, a cottage houses an old man and grandson.”

Zou ordered Gang to offer silver for lodging, respecting the dwellers’ consent. His benevolent reputation shone—a ruler who prized his people.

Among his forty guards were three captains and his adopted children. The youngest, Zou Wuhui, was cherished by all. The Emperor’s summons had upended their tranquil life in Liaozhou.

Zou Wuxiao had raged at the peril thrust upon them. Now, as fog thickened, the convoy pressed on, unaware of the trials ahead.
