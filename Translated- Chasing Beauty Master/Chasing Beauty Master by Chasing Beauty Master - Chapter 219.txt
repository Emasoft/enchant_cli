“Ahem.” Guan Yu explained, “There were ten people sent to kill me this time. I eliminated nine of them, one escaped. I plan to follow the trail and find out who ultimately wants me dead. I described that person’s appearance to Luo Cheng. I believe we’ll have results soon.”

“Describe the appearance again. My efficiency is higher than Luo Cheng’s.” Feng Xin declared in a tone that brooked no refusal.

“Uh...alright.” Guan Yu blinked, sensing Feng Xin’s anger seemed greater than his own. He proceeded to describe Fire-Hair’s distinctive features, also mentioning the very conspicuous green-haired youth who had died – this would make identification easier.

After listening, Feng Xin immediately picked up her phone, dialed a number, relayed Guan Yu’s descriptions, and ordered that the suspect’s profile be delivered to her by next morning.

Hanging up, she narrowed her eyes at Guan Yu with a smile. “I heard you went to rescue a woman?”

Guan Yu’s expression froze. He mentally cursed Luo Cheng – hadn’t they agreed not to mention Li Xi? Yet before a day had passed, everything was already exposed.

Of course, he was wronging Luo Cheng. Given Feng Xin’s status in City N, was it difficult for her to track someone’s movements? Especially when it concerned a man she cared about.

Seeing Guan Yu silent, Feng Xin’s face darkened. “Was it worth nearly dying for some woman?”

Guan Yu shook his head.

“If it wasn’t worth it, why take the risk?” Feng Xin snapped angrily.

“That’s not what I meant. It wasn’t me nearly dying for her – she almost lost her life because of me. I had to save her.” Guan Yu said earnestly.

He concisely recounted the day’s events, emphasizing Wan Qianshan’s possible hidden forces in City N and advising Feng Xin to stay vigilant.

Hearing this explanation, Feng Xin felt slightly better. Frowning, she asked, “Why would Wan Qianshan abandon his operations in Taiwan to come to City N?”

Guan Yu shrugged helplessly.

Suddenly, Feng Xin changed tack, locking eyes with him. “If I were in danger, would you save me?”

“Yes.” Guan Yu answered without hesitation, his voice steel.

Feng Xin’s face blossomed into a smile.

**Chapter 545: Do You Want to Keep Listening?**

The next morning, Guan Yu awoke early – not naturally, but because Feng Xin roused him. Her subordinates had obtained the requested information, and since she’d been awakened, she saw no reason to let Guan Yu linger in his warm bed of spring dreams.

After their conversation last night, Guan Yu hadn’t gone to Wen Qing’s room. Exhausted from intense physical exertion, he’d chosen to sleep embracing Du Xiaojuan’s petite feet. His excellent sleep quality only fueled Feng Xin’s irritation.

However, recalling how Guan Yu had unhesitatingly promised to rescue her if needed, her anger subsided. Sometimes, an attitude and a promise outweighed a thousand words.

Slapping a file on the table, Feng Xin said, “These are profiles of all red-haired underworld figures in City N. Identify which one it is.”

“So fast?” Guan Yu accepted the documents in amazement.

Feng Xin raised an eyebrow. How could it not be? She’d given her people strict orders last night to deliver the information by morning. None dared dawdle.

Guan Yu flipped through the pages until his lips curled into a dangerous smile. He tapped a photo. “This is the man who escaped last night.”

Leaning forward, Feng Xin glanced at the red-haired youth and frowned. “Zhong Liang?” Her tone dripped with disdain for this nobody. Getting to the point, she demanded, “Who’s Zhong Liang’s boss?”

This small fry didn’t concern her. The real target was whoever had ordered the hit on Guan Yu.

Guan Yu chuckled. “Zhong Liang works under a man named Qian Tong. According to the file, he’s the leader of a recently emerged minor faction in City N – owns five bars and some entertainment venues, illegally peddling drugs.”

A suddenly emerged faction? Guan Yu felt an inkling of understanding, though still unclear.

“Illegal drugs?” Feng Xin’s voice held restrained fury.

Guan Yu looked puzzled. “Isn’t drug dealing normal?”

“Not in City N. When the four major families ruled here, the elders collectively banned all drug trade. Any violators were eradicated.” Feng Xin explained.

“Then why does he dare?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Risking danger for wealth. Drug profits are astronomical, though they destroy lives. That’s why the elders prohibited it. That they dared violate this...” Her eyes hardened. “Even without your involvement, I’d have dealt with them.”

Guan Yu nodded. After the Xu family’s downfall (which he’d facilitated), the remaining three elders maintained this prohibition – a policy he respected, raising his esteem for them.

“Now we have legitimate grounds to eliminate Qian Tong.” Guan Yu sniffed. “By the way,” he added, “compile information on other factions closely connected to Qian Tong.”

“They’re involved too?” Feng Xin immediately grasped the implication.

“Possibly.” Guan Yu smiled enigmatically. “If he’s Wan Qianshan’s pawn in City N, there are likely more. We need to unearth them all.”

“I’ll have it done immediately. Whatever Wan Qianshan’s plans, I won’t let his influence spread here.” Murderous intent flashed in Feng Xin’s eyes – the true gangland queen.

After breakfast, as they prepared to depart, an unexpected visitor arrived – Xu Bin, grandson of Elder Xu.

“Brother Xu! What brings you here?” Guan Yu extended a warm hand.

“Straight to business – do you need help? Grandfather’s offer.” Xu Bin stated bluntly.

“Help?” Guan Yu paused, realizing news traveled faster than expected. “Just a minor faction. I can handle it.” He politely declined, wary of accumulating debts.

“Minor? Who in City N would dare cross you?” Xu Bin frowned.

“Qian Tong. Know him?”

Xu Bin pondered. “That upstart faction. We’ve been monitoring them. How dare this newborn calf challenge tigers? He’s suicidal.”

“Exactly. We’re off to deal with him now. My respects to Elder Xu soon.” Guan Yu smiled.

Xu Bin glanced at Feng Xin. Knowing their combined strength sufficed, he nodded. “Grandfather keeps asking after you. When will you visit? Just because Feng’s your grandfather-in-law doesn’t mean the others aren’t family too.”

Feng Xin flushed at the implication, glaring. Guan Yu pretended not to understand.

With messages delivered, Xu Bin departed. Guan Yu and Feng Xin mobilized their forces toward Qian Tong’s villa.

The isolated villa’s lack of guards – whether from arrogance or stupidity – allowed easy entry. Moans from a particular room guided them.

Guan Yu listened amusedly at the door, impressed by Qian Tong’s stamina. Blushing furiously, Feng Xin snapped, “Do you want to keep listening?”

**Chapter 546: Q&A Session**

They say a woman’s cries are battle hymns for men – heightening arousal and effort. For eavesdroppers, they’re potent aphrodisiacs that might bridge final gaps between would-be lovers.

For Guan Yu and Feng Xin – mutually attracted but not yet intimate – the charged atmosphere was palpable. Regretting the inopportune setting, Guan Yu’s stolen glance at Feng Xin’s ample bosom earned him a glare.

Reluctantly ending his eavesdropping, Guan Yu kicked the door. Not just broken, the entire door flew inward.

Mirroring this forceful entry, Qian Tong was reaching his climax when excruciating pain struck his lower back. Before he could roar in release, he found himself airborne like his door.

What’s life’s greatest tragedy? Not expired lottery tickets nor overnight riches-to-rags, but being interrupted mid-climax – billions of potential offspring trapped within.

Any man would rage. Despite his pain, Qian Tong tried rising, only to be kicked against the wall, his erection wilted.

The naked women screamed until a black pistol silenced them. “Get out.” Guan Yu commanded coldly. They fled naked, unnoticed – their charms paling beside Wen Qing’s.

When Qian Tong’s vision cleared, he froze at the smirking youth before him – the ghost who should be dead. Swallowing panic, he blustered, “Who the hell are you? Get out before I call the cops!”

Guan Yu tilted his head. “Need introductions? You recognized me instantly.”

“I don’t know you! Leave or I’ll–”

“Surprised I survived?” Guan Yu cut in. “This villa’s feng shui makes a nice grave.”

Qian Tong paled but threatened, “My guards come in five minutes. Dare kill me in daylight?”

“Who said I’ll kill you? You’ll commit suicide.” Guan Yu’s smile chilled the room.

As true fear set in, Guan Yu leaned close. “Answer my questions, and you live.”

Qian Tong stayed silent – streetwise enough to distrust promises.

Unfazed, Guan Yu began interrogation: “Your connection to Wan Qianshan?”

No answer. A kick smashed Qian Tong’s face.

“From now on, each unanswered question earns a kick.”

“What’s Wan Qianshan’s purpose placing you here?”

Silence. Kick.

“How many like you does he have in City N?”

Silence. Kick.

“Which local factions work with him?”

Kick before he could refuse.

Question after question, kick after kick – Guan Yu’s brutal rhythm continued mercilessly.

**Chapter 547: Leave It to Me**

Qian Tong now realized the futility of resistance. Guan Yu kept kicking regardless of responses – pure retribution.

He resigned himself. Who could’ve foreseen this when he’d dismissed guards for “private time”? Five minutes until reinforcements – but Guan Yu saw through this.

“Think your thugs can stop me?” Guan Yu sneered, reading his mind.

“They can’t...but dare you murder me openly?”

“Who said murder? You’ll hang yourself.” Guan Yu’s deadpan reply terrified.

The interrogation continued – kicks punctuating each query about Wan Qianshan’s network. Bloodied and broken, Qian Tong clung to silence, knowing his fate was sealed the moment this vengeful ghost entered.
