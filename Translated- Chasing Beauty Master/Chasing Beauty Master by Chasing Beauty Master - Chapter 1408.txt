“A pass?” Guan Yu and Yan Zhao exclaimed in unison. Guan Yu shot Wang Xiaorong a disgruntled look. Despite her elaborate disguise, their relationship remained exposed. Though Xiaorong’s claim of being his fiancée wasn’t entirely unreasonable, he felt a proper young lady should show more restraint than bluntly declaring herself betrothed.

Yan Zhao’s eyes smoldered with frustration. How could this stunning beauty already be claimed by that oaf Guan Yu? What a waste! His thoughts drifted bitterly to last night’s encounter—spending silver on an aging courtesan who paled in comparison to this vision before him. Limited funds and the need to conserve resources for the journey had forced him to choose cheap companionship, but the disparity in quality stung.

“Guan Yu never mentioned a fiancée earlier,” Yan Zhao interjected, masking his irritation. “He only spoke of meeting a friend. Had it been an ordinary companion, I’d have objected to bringing them on our mission. But since it’s his betrothed...” He trailed off, already scheming. Perhaps this radiant flower could be plucked from Guan Yu’s grasp. Such beauty deserved appreciation, and what better diversion during this tedious mission than stealing his rival’s woman?

Wang Xiaorong laughed melodiously. “You’ll find me quite useful, Master Yan. My skills will prove invaluable.”

Rising abruptly, Guan Yu declared, “Enough chatter. Let’s eat and depart.” Though three camels had been prepared for the desert crossing, Xiaorong insisted on sharing Guan Yu’s mount.

“Wan—Meimei,” Guan Yu corrected himself hastily, “Each rider needs their own camel for safety. The beasts endure better when not overburdened.”

Pouting but acquiescent, Xiaorong countered, “Must we switch so soon? Horses fare better until the true desert. What say you, Master Yan?”

“The lady speaks wisdom!” Yan Zhao leaped at the chance to ingratiate himself. “Let us ride swifter steeds awhile longer.”

“No,” Guan Yu overruled. “The best camels come from this town. What lies ahead are inferior breeds. We switch now and acclimate them for the journey.” He hoisted his pack onto a camel’s hump and mounted decisively. “We depart.”

Though Xiaorong doubted his camel lore, she yielded. Yan Zhao, whose true motives lay elsewhere, offered no further objection.

By sunset, they reached a sizable town boasting ample provisions. After securing lodging, Yan Zhao barked at the innkeeper: “See our camels fed with your finest grain!”

The serving boy gaped openly at Xiaorong’s beauty until she snapped, “Keep staring and I’ll pluck those peeping eyes from your skull!”

Guan Yu sighed. A veil became imperative—her allure invited too much attention. When asked about rooms, Yan Zhao requested three.

“Two suffice,” Xiaorong interjected, clinging to Guan Yu’s arm. “I’ll share with my betrothed. Unless Master Yan wishes two rooms for himself?” She marched inward, ignoring Yan Zhao’s crestfallen expression.

Over a lavish meal Yan Zhao ordered (intending to stick Guan Yu with the bill), tensions simmered. Guan Yu feigned nonchalance about his pouch of gold leaves—a gift from Elder Lu that Yan Zhao coveted.

“Since Master Yan offers to pay tonight,” Guan Yu remarked pointedly, “We’ll retire early. Our room’s already settled.” He guided Xiaorong upstairs, leaving Yan Zhao fuming over unpaid bills.

Later, strolling through town, Guan Yu explained his purpose: “You need a veil. That serving boy’s leering proved the necessity.”

Xiaorong pouted. “I spent hours perfecting this look for you! Must you hide it?”

“Your beauty distracts,” he conceded, softening. “Wear it by day—remove it each evening for my eyes alone.”

Her protest died at this compromise. As they wandered past market stalls, Guan Yu contemplated the journey ahead—a desert trek shadowed by Yan Zhao’s envy, financial trickery, and the ever-present danger of Xiaorong’s unmasking.
