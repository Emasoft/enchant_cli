“Nothing much, we’re just here to plunder. This isn’t our first time. In the desert, this is how things are. We encountered them, so we’re taking their goods. If you aren’t their allies, we ask you to leave,” the other party said.

“Oh? So you’ve become desert bandits now?” Xiaomei stepped forward, her voice sharp. “Even our Jia Yi Sect hasn’t dared to act as lawlessly as you. If every tribe in the desert started robbing freely, how would our sect survive? You’re spitting on the Jia Yi Sect’s reputation!”

“You’re from the Jia Yi Sect?” The bandit seemed to recognize the name, his tone shifting.

Truthfully, Xiaomei was merely invoking the sect’s infamy. Though the Jia Yi Sect was notorious, this remote desert region lay far beyond their territory, so their name held little sway here.

The situation bordered on absurd—bandits clashing with bandits, while the arrogant High Mountain Sect stood by, oblivious to the danger.

“Yes, we’re from the Jia Yi Sect. Which tribe do you belong to?” Xiaomei demanded. The desert housed countless tribes, many unknown even to her, given its vastness.

“That can wait. We’d rather know which side you intend to aid,” the bandit pressed.

Guanyu interjected coolly, “We’re not helping either side. To put it bluntly, your survival means nothing to us. We’re merely passing through. Carry on with your fight.”

Though Guanyu preferred to avoid entanglement, Xiaomei saw opportunity. “After observing both sides,” she declared, pacing theatrically, “your strengths seem evenly matched. A slight nudge from us could tip the scales. I won’t pretend we’re altruists—the Jia Yi Sect seizes advantages where they lie. Whichever side offers greater... *sincerity* will earn our aid.”

Guanyu nearly laughed. *This isn’t opportunistic? What else would you call it?* Yet he held his tongue. With their false Jia Yi Sect identities, they could afford this charade. Even if violence erupted, so long as their true Cloud Azure Sect ties remained hidden, the High Mountain Sect would gain nothing.

**Chapter 4588: Begging for Scraps**

“The Jia Yi Sect truly knows how to profit from chaos!” sneered the High Mountain Sect’s Young Master, his bandaged shoulder twitching as he chuckled. “Let’s see what these paupers can offer. Filthy desert rats—doubt they’ve anything worthwhile.”

Though a minor sect with little renown, the High Mountain Sect lived comfortably, far wealthier than desert tribes. The Young Master tossed a coin pouch to the ground like alms to beggars.

“Is this all?” Guanyu stepped forward, blocking Xiaomei before her greed could respond. “You boast grandly yet toss crumbs? And you throw it like we’re dogs? Keep your insulting scraps.”

A composed High Mountain elder retrieved the pouch, offering it respectfully. “We humbly seek your aid today. Name your price, and our sect shall fulfill it.”

Guanyu brushed it aside. “We’ve no interest in trifles. Your ‘generosity’ speaks clearly.”

Xiaomei, emboldened, added, “We’ve never worked so cheaply. Save your pitiful offers.”

“You call *this* extortion?” The Young Master flushed. “We carry little silver now, but return to our sect, and we’ll pay double!”

“Trust you to repay?” Xiaomei scoffed. “The sun would rise from the west first!”

“Enough games!” The Young Master snapped. “These coins are fortune to desert rats. Stop pretending superiority!”

“Who’s pretending?” Xiaomei produced an 800-tael silver note—Guanyu’s camel funds—waving it tauntingly. “This is pocket change to me. You think *crumbs* impress anyone?”

Covetous glares followed the note. The Gute Tribe’s leader spoke: “Help us, and our 300 warriors will pledge one service to you. Silver we lack, but strength we offer.”

Xiaomei hesitated—the tribe’s remote location diminished their usefulness. Guanyu seized the moment: “Both offers disappoint. The silver’s meager, and the Gute Tribe’s too distant for timely aid. The Jia Yi Sect isn’t a charity. We’ll abstain.”

Siqi nodded. “No benefit, no action. Beneath our sect’s dignity.”

Xiaomei relented. “Fight amongst yourselves. We’ll move on.”

As they turned to leave, the Gute Tribe shouted, “Wait! If you won’t aid us... perhaps join *us* against them?” Their leader gestured to Xiaomei’s silver. “Split her notes fifty-fifty!”

Xiaomei laughed coldly. “Starving enough to rob robbers? The notes are here. Try taking them.”

The High Mountain Sect’s Young Master eyed the alliance, but his elder warned, “Even united, we’re outmatched.”

Guanyu mocked, “Pathetic—allying with those who attacked you? They’ll discard you once we’re dead.”

Wang Jun added, “You’ll be spent pawns. They’ll take everything.”

**Chapter 4589: No Face Given**

The Gute tribesman pressed, “We keep our word. Help us, share the silver. Refuse, and we’ll slaughter them regardless. Choose: die now or gamble for wealth.”

Guanyu sighed. Conflict loomed inevitable.

**Chapter 4590: Minor Display**

The High Mountain Sect’s Young Master growled, “I don’t fear battle! For silver and pride, we’ll fight!”

Wang Jun’s warning echoed: “They’ll betray you after.”

The Gute leader swore, “We honor agreements. Our tribe starves—this robbery was desperation, not malice.”

Guanyu assessed the swelling tensions. “Your ‘alliance’ reeks of deceit. Bandits partnering with victims? Folly.”

Xiaomei twirled her silver note. “Come then. Let’s see your resolve.”

As both sides hesitated, the desert wind carried the stench of greed and blood.
