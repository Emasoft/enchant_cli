Now, as for Guan Yu’s cultivation level, even if the lights were off or his eyes were covered, Liu Shilei’s body would appear crystal clear before him, leaving no secrets hidden. A stream of blood involuntarily gushed from Guan Yu’s nose, splattering across Liu Shilei’s snow-white chest.

**Chapter 1653: Mu Yun**

Feeling the warm liquid splash onto her chest, Liu Shilei couldn’t help but chuckle softly, “Still so easily excited, just like twenty years ago.”

Though yearning to relive old dreams with her, Guan Yu knew patience was key—she needed time to accept this rekindled bond. Instead of pressing further, he clasped her hands, palms touching, and channeled spiritual energy from his core into her body through their connected palms.

Simultaneously, a flash of clarity illuminated Liu Shilei’s mind as a stream of information—the time-reversal cultivation technique—flooded her consciousness. Guided by Guan Yu’s energy, she instinctively began circulating the method within her meridians.

The next morning, when Liu Shilei awoke from her cultivation, she felt unusually light. A sudden urgency led her to the bathroom. Upon emerging and catching her reflection in the mirror, she gasped.

The face staring back was radiant—porcelain-smooth skin blushed with youthful pink, so startlingly fresh that she barely recognized herself.

Hearing her cry, Guan Yu embraced her from behind, whispering in her ear, “See, Sister? I didn’t lie. Remember—if cultivation keeps me young, why not you? After just one day, you look younger than Sun Xiaoya! I simply must taste this…”

His hands slid upward beneath her oversized T-shirt. Liu Shilei, who had hastily thrown on the shirt after rushing to the bathroom, let out a soft moan and melted into his arms.

Guan Yu’s restraint shattered. He swept her into his embrace.

***

Liu Shilei had feared aging before him, hence her resistance. Now, witnessing the technique’s miraculous effects, her defenses crumbled. Burying her face against his chest, she let him carry her to bed, closing her eyes to savor affection denied for two decades.

Arriving at Mingyang Elite High with barely ten minutes before class, the school guard gaped as Guan Yu hurriedly exited Liu Shilei’s car post-bell.

*This freshman’s audacious! First riding his homeroom teacher’s car, now the principal’s within days. Relative? Or some… special talent?* The guard mentally vowed not to cross this student—clearly no ordinary troublemaker.

At the classroom door, Sun Xiaoya stood glaring. She turned away as Guan Yu approached, lips sealed. Amused, he ignored her—still basking in the morning’s warmth with Liu Shilei.

During break, Yang Lin finally approached. After thanking Guan Yu for previous help, he stammered, “Brother Guan… Mu Yun wants to meet you tonight.”

With Wang Jun’s gang incapacitated, Mu Yun had used Yang Lin as messenger. Relieved the boy remained unharmed, Guan Yu resolved to aid him—unlike Wang Jun’s ilk, Yang Lin’s descent into their circle stemmed from his father’s medical debts.

Xu Ying interjected worriedly, “Don’t go! Mu Yun’s a mutant. Their power… it’s beyond human limits. You’ll die!”

Yang Lin added, “They say he can lift fully-loaded trucks—arms of ten-thousand-pound strength, bulletproof skin. Stay here. He won’t dare kill on school grounds.”

Both believed Mu Yun’s mutant status granted impunity. Guan Yu’s jaw tightened—since when did China tolerate such lawlessness? This rot demanded cleansing.

“Thank you,” he smiled. “But I’ll meet him. Who dies tonight remains to be seen.”

***

At dismissal, Sun Xiaoya left without her usual invitation. Puzzled but preoccupied, Guan Yu informed Liu Shilei of his errand before departing with Yang Lin.

At the stadium, Guan Yu dismissed Yang Lin and phased through the gates via spatial shift—materializing silently on the track.

In the dark, a stocky figure stood waiting. A flash, and Guan Yu faced Mu Yun—a paunchy, clean-shaven man resembling a merchant more than feared mutant.

**Chapter 1654: Force Against Force**

Days prior, Mu Yun had dismissed Wang Jun’s alarm. His seasoned enforcers could crush small gangs—how fail against a student? Yet Guan Yu had crippled them, forcing Mu Yun’s personal attention.

Investigations revealed Guan Yu as an ordinary transfer student—no mutant registry match. Confident against mere martial artists, Mu Yun arranged this meeting.

Now, probing Guan Yu’s aura-less frame, Mu Yun snorted. No mutant energy—just another mortal to crush.

“You’re that Mingyang student?” he sneered.

Guan Yu sensed the odd energy within Mu Yun—the mutant’s signature. “Here to avenge your lackeys?” he retorted.

Mu Yun’s body erupted—skin turning steely, muscles swelling grotesquely. With a ground-shattering stomp, he roared, “I’ll pulp you!”

Guan Yu stood firm, raising a bare fist. *Let’s test mutant strength.*

***

**BOOM!**

Their collision birthed a shockwave flattening grass and shattering barriers. Guan Yu’s feet sank three inches into asphalt while Mu Yun staggered back, pallid beneath metallic skin.

“Not bad,” Guan Yu smirked, flexing his hand. “Now let’s test your durability.”

Mu Yun gaped. No one—not steel nor concrete—withstood his full force. Yet this boy remained unscathed.

As golden light enveloped Guan Yu’s fist, Mu Yun’s bravado crumbled. “What… what are you?!”

“Your answer’s coming,” Guan Yu advanced, aura flaring. Mu Yun tried fleeing but found himself rooted—terror dawning as that glowing fist rose.

**Chapter 1655: Shock**

Before his mutation, Mu Yun—a white-collar embezzler—knew nothing of martial arts. Of fifty convicts subjected to the experiment, only he survived. Divine favor, he’d thought, until tonight.

Now, facing Guan Yu’s radiant power, decades of arrogance evaporated. “Is this… qigong?!” he croaked.

Guan Yu offered no reply. Step by step, his golden fist neared the paralyzed mutant—a walking god rendering Mu Yun’s vaunted strength laughable.
