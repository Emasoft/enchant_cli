“For the Swordless Villa, its reputation in the martial world is beyond question. One could even say it ranks among the greatest internal energy sects, though its sparse membership prevents it from being formally recognized as such. Some outsiders even gossip that the villa is nothing more than a bandit den nestled in the mountains.”

Wang Jun chuckled, “A’ze, this is a golden opportunity. Why not give it a try? Let me tell you—that Zhao Xue isn’t all that formidable. Just defeat the challengers ahead, and you’ll likely pass.”

A’ze had initially considered stepping forward but hesitated. He glanced back at Guan Yu, who was smirking at him. “Do you think I’ll get beaten half to death if I go up there?”

“Of course not,” Wang Jun reassured. “They’ve made it clear—this is a friendly competition. No casualties allowed. Besides, with so much gold and a peerless beauty waiting, aren’t you tempted as a man?”

“Why keep pushing *me*? Why don’t *you* go up?” A’ze retorted irritably. “All this talk just reveals *your* interest in Zhao Xue!”

Wang Jun stiffened, caught off guard. A’ze pressed on, “You’re a man too. Seems like *you’re* the one infatuated with her, yet you prod me to act. What kind of twisted logic is that?”

Pursing his lips, Wang Jun grumbled, “Suit yourself. If *I* went up, you’d have no chance anyway. I’m trying to help you, you ungrateful cur! Can’t tell a friend’s goodwill from a foe’s!”

Guan Yu, listening with amusement, interjected, “A’ze, you really should try. The rules don’t forbid spells. As a cultivator, what’s there to fear? Worst case, you’ll just step down if disqualified.”

Encouraged, A’ze nodded. With spells prepared, defeating opponents would be effortless. Finally persuaded, he strode forward, gripping his magical brush to bolster his courage.

As he ascended the stage, he muttered, “May they go easy on me… Just let me claim the gold and catch Zhao Xue’s eye.”

Though her face remained veiled, Zhao Xue’s alluring figure and melodious voice suggested undeniable beauty. For men like A’ze—starved of female company at the Yunqing Sect—winning such a bride would be a triumph.

Guan Yu suddenly asked Wang Jun, “What of Du Bingyan? Has Xiao Zhi sought her out?”

“Unlikely. Xiao Zhi’s buried in his cultivation manual. Du Bingyan’s vanished lately—no news. But Prince Zou arranged her situation. She should be safe.”

“Xiao Zhi’s a fool,” Guan Yu sighed. “This is a critical phase. The girl isn’t bound to him. He should visit often or bring her to the sect. Neglect risks losing her.”

“Who’s Du Bingyan?” Siqi inquired.

“A girl Xiao Zhi met during our last mission,” Guan Yu explained. “Her plight moved him. They grew close, but now she’s orphaned, waiting while he ignores her. Pure coincidence how we met her—she was a thief we chased back then.”

Onstage, A’ze bowed courteously to Master Zhao and addressed the steward: “May I challenge?”

A’ze’s appearance was unremarkable—neither strikingly handsome nor imposing, lacking Guan Yu’s charisma. The steward eyed him skeptically. “A scholar? This is a martial contest, young master. No place for theatrics.”

The Zhao family, steeped in martial tradition, disdained bookish weakness. Even Master Zhao frowned, summoning the steward. “This milksop clutches a *brush*! Send him away—he’ll only disrupt the proceedings.”

The steward whispered, “Let him fight. A quick defeat will teach him humility.”

Overhearing, A’ze stiffened. His cultivator’s physique, though lean, belied his strength. “Are spells permitted here? Your rules don’t forbid cultivators.”

The crowd stirred. Cultivators rarely mingled in towns, much less entered brawls. Master Zhao and the steward exchanged startled glances. Zhao Xue herself turned—her second glance at A’ze.

“Our… oversight,” Master Zhao conceded stiffly. “We welcome all challengers equally.”

A’ze smirked at their hypocrisy. “Then let’s begin.”

The steward sneered, “For fairness, we’ll pit you against our weakest guard—Ah Gou. Lest we’re accused of bullying.”

“My gratitude,” A’ze said dryly, seething inwardly.

When “Ah Gou” limped onto the stage—a hunched, elderly man—the crowd murmured. Guan Yu frowned. “They mock him.”

Wang Jun laughed. “Look at A’ze’s face! He’s cursing me inwardly.”

“Easiest opponent yet,” Guan Yu said. “Watch—he’s already channeling spells.”

A’ze’s brush, a gift from Xuan Ming, glowed faintly. Though modest in power, it accelerated spellcasting—crucial for close combat.

The steward asked, “Do you require weapons?”

A’ze raised his brush. “This suffices. Begin when ready.”

As the steward signaled, A’ze unleashed a lightning spell. The crackling bolt struck Ah Gou, leaving him twitching on the ground.

“Treachery!” the steward roared. “You attacked without warning!”

A’ze retorted, “*You* gave the signal! Blame your man’s sluggishness. Does the Zhao family scorn fairness?”

The steward flushed, accusations crumbling under the crowd’s judgment.
