“Legend has it that the Ten Thousand Year Demonic Realm is a miraculous piece of jade said to possess life-restoring powers,” Guan Yu explained. “My friend’s father has been afflicted by a serpent venom for over a decade with no cure. I believe obtaining this jade could purge the poison from his body.”

“What manner of venom could linger so viciously for years?” Jones remarked with astonishment. “Snake toxins are yin-cold by nature. Victims either recover swiftly with treatment or perish outright. I’ve never heard of anyone surviving a decade-long infestation.”

By conventional logic, Jones was correct. Had Qing Guanghui received timely treatment years ago, he might have recovered. Yet against all odds, the man survived—not through medicine, but by sheer cultivation strength and an accidental infusion of infant blood that sustained him.

Such circumstances were unprecedented, Guan Yu mused. The man now faced dual perils: Ma Hai’s relentless pursuit and the threat of his formidable demonic-path junior sister. Guan Yu could only hope Qing and his disciples would safely reach the tropical forest.

“My friend endures unimaginable suffering,” Guan Yu continued. “He must dwell in that forest, where the miasma suppresses his venom’s resurgence. There, he survives by hunting venomous serpents.”

“So you wish me to dispatch agents to investigate the Feng family about this Demonic Realm?” Jones deduced, her eyes sharpening with understanding.

Guan Yu nodded approvingly, impressed by her swift comprehension. “The Feng heir’s greatest weakness is his predilection for women. Send beauties to approach him—but cautiously, whether successful or not. The Fengs are likely already on guard.”

“You’ve visited their estate already?”

“To no avail,” Guan Yu confirmed.

Eager to assist, Jones agreed to deploy operatives. Soon after, Jiang Fenju entered upon summons. “Boss, your orders?” The man’s eyes crinkled upon seeing Guan Yu. “Deputy Leader, long time no see.”

Recognition dawned—this was the man who’d tried recruiting Guan Yu during a taekwondo tournament years prior. “Had I known you were part of Jones’ organization,” Guan Yu remarked, “we might’ve avoided past complications.”

“I intended to surprise you through my subordinates,” Jones chuckled. “Never anticipated your stubborn refusal.”

“Why wasn’t he present during my inauguration?”

“On mission duty,” Jones answered before instructing Jiang: “Select our most capable female operatives to infiltrate the Feng heir’s circle. Discover the Demonic Realm’s whereabouts.”

As Jiang departed, Guan Yu acknowledged the plan’s uncertainty but saw no alternatives. Suddenly recalling another matter, he asked, “Does the mall above sell computer components?”

At Jones’ confirmation, he requested four high-end desktops with premium peripherals. “Selling them? Opening an internet café?” Jones teased.

“My four household deities,” Guan Yu groaned, “have become obsessed with online games. They claim laptops lag—now demand desktops.” Rising, he locked the door and embraced Jones. Their lingering tension found release in passionate reunion.

Returning to Jinhua’s residence that evening, Guan Yu delivered Amei to her apartment before handling computer deliveries at Qiaoyuan District. Finding the gaming quartet too absorbed to cook, he fetched takeout amidst their chaotic demands.

“Unpack these!” Xue Jing ordered when the computers arrived. “And install them in Hanhan’s room—hers is largest!”

“Why not have deliverymen do it earlier?” Guan Yu grumbled as he hauled equipment upstairs.

“I’d strangle any man entering my room!” Zhang Han declared dramatically.

“Can’t a man handle simple labor?” Lü Mei chimed in, amusement coloring her rebuke.

Outnumbered, Guan Yu complied. Returning downstairs, he found the quartet gaming on laptops. “Play by day, but not late nights,” he admonished. “Aging accelerates with sleep deprivation. Grow haggard, and I’ll replace you all!”

“Stop nagging!” Xue Jing snapped. “You got me killed!” Lü Mei complained. Even gentle Amei joined the chorus: “You’re disrupting us!”

Defeated, Guan Yu retreated to bed. Morning brought further absurdity—Lü Mei skipped school for gaming. Wang Shu, her baffled chauffeur, received no explanation beyond Guan Yu’s resigned shrug.

Breakfast errands interrupted by Wei Hongwei’s call: “The网吧 attackers were Feng Jiawei’s men—likely Ma Hai’s orders.” Guan Yu simultaneously mobilized Jiang Fenju’s team for surveillance.

Tracking Feng Jiawei to the Hutton Hotel, Guan Yu’s pursuit was interrupted by a pursuing purple Bentley. After evasive maneuvers, the sports car cornered him. A long-legged beauty emerged—Feng Xihu, the Feng cousin he’d once bedded under aromatic influences.

“So you’re Guan Yu?” Her melodic voice carried steel. “Where’s the courage from that night?” she challenged, leaning into his window.

Bystanders gathered as Feng Xihu theatrically accused him of abandonment. “You used me and deny it now?” Her performance attracted moralizing onlookers until Feng Jiawei’s arrival disrupted the scene.

Spotting his cousin and the woman in Feng Jiawei’s BMW, Feng Xihu scowled at their family’s predatory habits. The confrontation hung unresolved—another thread in Guan Yu’s ever-complicating web.
