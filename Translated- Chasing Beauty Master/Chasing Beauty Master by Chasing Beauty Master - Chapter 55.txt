Guan Yu had been frantically replenishing his sugar reserves precisely for emergencies like this. If his abilities failed at a critical moment due to insufficient bodily energy, the consequences would be catastrophic. Yet now... the energy he'd accumulated over two days seemed utterly inadequate!

His body trembled faintly as cold sweat beaded on his forehead, yet the warm current flowing through him showed no signs of ceasing.

"Stop! This must stop!" The thought flashed through Guan Yu's mind. Instantly, the golden coin in his mental space flickered and vanished, cutting off the energy flow.

*Huff...* After a deep breath, Guan Yu withdrew his left hand. His ambitious plan to cure terminal illnesses through his abilities had crashed against harsh reality—even treating twenty percent of a condition required more energy than he possessed. This incomplete session couldn't have achieved even half that effectiveness.

He had no idea what percentage he'd actually healed after consuming days' worth of stored energy. Attempting to activate his Detection Skill yielded nothing—no response no matter how hard he concentrated.

"Damn it! Don't tell me..." Panic struck like a hammer blow. The terrifying possibility of losing his powers after performing a good deed made him feel like a beggar who'd won the lottery only to lose the ticket—desperate, fearful, consumed by regret.

"A-Child... I really felt it!" Mother Luo suddenly grasped his arm, her voice trembling with emotion. "Your qigong worked! The warmth... I haven't felt this comfortable in years!"

Guan Yu's initial joy faded quickly. "Effective? What's the use when I can't even activate Detection now?"

His mind raced through crumbling dreams—continuing treatments, earning money through bone-setting martial arts, becoming an antique appraiser, a miracle doctor... All vanished like morning dew. The golden coin might as well never have existed.

Wiping cold sweat, Guan Yu sighed despondently. But Mother Luo's exclamation had drawn attention. Patients, caregivers, and newly arrived medical staff turned curious gazes their way.

"Qigong?" The elderly professor frowned skeptically. "Superstitious nonsense! This is a hospital. Take your charlatan act elsewhere!"

"But Doctor—"

"No 'buts'! If qigong could cure end-stage uremia, why would millions die yearly from kidney failure?" The professor waved dismissively. "Your only hope is a transplant. Even Hua Tuo reborn couldn't save you otherwise!"

Guan Yu glared at the condescending physician. Being labeled a fraud after sacrificing his energy reserves stung bitterly.

"Unconvinced, boy?" The professor sneered. "Prove it! Cure her now and I'll resign and kneel before you!"

Guan Yu's retort died in his throat—without functional abilities, he stood defenseless. The staff's mocking laughter echoed as the professor continued berating him for "preying on the vulnerable."

As security threats chased him from the ward, Guan Yu's hands shook with suppressed fury. Yet reflection tempered his anger—hadn't he once shared their skepticism about mystical cures?

Digging through pockets, he found salvation in leftover chocolates. The candies dissolved instantly upon touching his tongue, energy flooding his system like parched earth absorbing rain. Three pieces later, vitality returned in a rush.

*Ding!* The familiar chime of reactivated Detection Skill brought euphoric relief. Scanning Mother Luo confirmed the miracle—her condition had regressed from terminal to late-stage uremia. His treatment had reversed the irreversible!

While doctors fussed with machines and medications, Guan Yu quietly celebrated. Each candy-fueled session chipped away at the disease. Though progress seemed slow, his methods already surpassed decades of medical science.

By the thirty-third chocolate, a plan crystallized—moderate daily treatments sustained by sugar intake could stabilize then gradually cure Mother Luo. No need for dramatic reveals; steady progress would speak louder than any argument.

When Mother Luo excitedly reported renewed energy to her adopted son Luo Cheng, Guan Yu simply smiled. Let the skeptics doubt. Time and results would vindicate both his methods and the ancient power flowing through him—one piece of candy at a time.
