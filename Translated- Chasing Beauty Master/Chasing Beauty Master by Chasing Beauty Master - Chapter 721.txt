After listening to Guan Yu’s words, Jinhua secretly giggled beside them, while Yang Conghan let out a soft laugh. That single smile, however, struck Guan Yu with such intensity that he found himself momentarily entranced.

Yang Conghan’s smile possessed a beauty capable of toppling cities and summoning cataclysms. Its allure lay in the perfection of her crimson lips parting to reveal immaculate teeth, the delicate dimples gracing her flawless cheeks, and the irresistible purity that radiated from her very essence.

“Is my question truly so amusing?” Guan Yu wondered, perplexed by the women’s laughter.

“A single smile from Miss Yang could conquer nations,” he praised. “I imagine you seldom reveal such grace to outsiders?”

Yang Conghan, regaining her composure, swiftly resumed her icy demeanor. “You flatter me, Young Master Guan Yu. The truth is simpler: those fish swam near my feet because Jinhua scattered bait behind me. Their presence was merely hunger, not enchantment.”

Realization dawned on Guan Yu. “So that’s why you laughed earlier! I’d foolishly believed the fish possessed spiritual wisdom.”

Jinhua interjected playfully, “Young Master, won’t you read our Xiaohan’s romantic fortune? Her father grows desperate—will she remain unwed forever?”

“Jinhua!” Yang Conghan rebuked sharply. “Another thoughtless remark, and I’ll leave you behind next time.”

Guan Yu nodded solemnly. “Marriage is no jest. The club’s layout conflicts with its elemental alignment, creating an isolation hex. This explains why the Yang family struggles to connect with others.”

He understood well: as leaders of City A’s Four Great Clans, the Yangs were perceived as aloof deities, though they craved approachability. The world kept them at arm’s length.

“Observe the hall below, Miss Yang.” Guan Yu rose, gesturing as she joined him. “The western entrance matters less than the furnishings forming a ‘destruction’ character. Look closely—do you see it?”

Jinhua peered over the railing.

The club’s crimson carpet stretched from entrance to central bar, flanked by twin staircases. Decorative screens and artworks lining the paths indeed sketched the ominous character when viewed from above.

Yang Conghan gasped in realization, Jinhua mirroring her shock with a hand-clasped mouth.

“This ‘destruction’ pattern poisons your fortunes,” Guan Yu explained. “To attract vitality, we must first reshape this hall’s feng shui.”

“Xiaohan, we should heed Young Master Guan Yu’s advice,” Jinhua urged. “A renovation—”

Yang Conghan, already convinced, interrupted, “What modifications do you propose, Young Master? The Yang family will remember this kindness.”

**Chapter 1831: The Mysterious Master**

Though Yang Conghan had often surveyed this hall, she’d never noticed the hidden pattern. The design—her own creation—originated from her father’s bathhouse converted years prior into this lavish club.

Her gaze now held new wariness as she studied Guan Yu. “Since you understand feng shui’s depths, help us reshape this place. Name any future favor, and I’ll fulfill it.”

“Assisting City A’s foremost beauty is honor enough,” Guan Yu replied courteously. Among countless lovely faces, Yang Conghan’s radiance stood unique—a marvel that stirred any man’s heart, his included.

Producing a bank card from her desk, Yang Conghan declared, “This should cover expenses. Oversee the feng shui adjustments.”

“Gladly, though practical matters should go to Hou Jinshun. Decoration isn’t my expertise.”

As Guan Yu sipped tea, a small knife twirled in his left hand. Both women stiffened at the sight—Jinhua’s glance toward her mistress, Yang Conghan’s fleeting expression betrayed their recognition.

The blade, retrieved from a past encounter where a black-clad woman rescued a kidnapped girl, carried a distinctive fragrance. Earlier, ascending the stairs, Guan Yu had detected that same scent—Yang Conghan’s signature perfume.

“This aroma lingers remarkably,” he mused, sniffing the blade. “Custom-blended, no doubt. A telltale trace of its owner.”

Yang Conghan sighed in surrender. “You’ve unmasked me. Yes, I was that night’s cloaked figure.”

During their first meeting, she’d threatened Guan Yu’s life, never imagining her perfume would reveal her identity. Yet instead of hostility, Guan Yu admired her courage in saving the abducted child.

“City A’s reigning beauty, heiress to the Yang dynasty—what other identity hides behind these masks?” Guan Yu inquired lazily.

“Merely membership in a minor supernatural faction. Surely you’ve heard of such groups?”

Had Guan Yu retained his memories, he might have. Amnesia left him ignorant.

“Your skills impress me. Who trained you?”

“My father. The Yangs were once martial artists before cultivating supernatural talents. Our techniques remain ancestral.”

“Why were you there that night?” Guan Yu pressed.

Yang Conghan flushed. “I... cannot say. Doubt me if you must, but leave if you distrust.” In truth, she’d abandoned the knife during her hurried escape from police sirens.

“Young Master,” Jinhua interjected, defusing tension, “why interrogate a lady so? Could you fancy our Xiaohan?”

“All men admire Miss Yang’s beauty,” Guan Yu conceded. “Appearance alone doesn’t sway me, though admiration exists.”

Jinhua’s eyes sparkled at his principled response. Yang Conghan nodded. “My rude words that night—I apologize.”

“No offense taken.” Guan Yu inhaled the blade’s scent again. “This fragrance intoxicates... much like its owner’s.”

Yang Conghan blushed—unprecedented reaction to a man’s bold compliment. Jinhua gaped; her mistress never displayed such vulnerability.

A knock interrupted. Jinhua returned announcing, “Young Master Feng seeks you, Xiaohan.”

Yang Conghan’s face darkened. “Send him away. I’m occupied.”

**Chapter 1832: Throwing Herself at Him**

Guan Yu marveled at the revelation—the agile vigilante was City A’s prime heiress. Beauty, status, skill—all converged in one enigma. The rescued girl’s identity remained unknown, Yang Conghan’s “passing by” excuse ringing hollow.

As Jinhua dismissed the visitor, Guan Yu inquired, “This Feng—another Four Families scion?”

“A pest,” Yang Conghan spat. “His clan’s power shields his atrocities.”

Jinhua added, “He constantly harasses Xiaohan! Young Master, only you dare teach him lesson!”

“Why me alone?”

“Because you’re Huayu Group’s chairm—” Jinhua clapped hands over her mouth.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “So you knew my identity all along.”

Yang Conghan sighed. “Today’s meeting was no accident. Qiao Han merely bait to draw you here.”

“To what end?”

Blushing scarlet, Yang Conghan confessed, “To... become your woman. Your protection could save my family.”

Guan Yu stared. “A beauty like you needs no schemes for attention.”

Jinhua’s inner turmoil surfaced—her romantic hopes dashed as mistress claimed priority.

“Your Boundary Sovereign relic could heal my father,” Yang Conghan pressed. “The Fengs offer their ancestral jade if I marry their heir—a fate worse than death. You’re our last hope.”

Guan Yu frowned. “Why reject Feng’s proposal?”

“How dare you?!” Jinhua exploded. “That debauched monster? Xiaohan’s father would rather die than see her wedded to such filth!”

Yang Conghan nodded grimly. “Even healed, Father’s shame would kill him. The relic alone can save us.”

**Chapter 1833: Vying for Favor**

Guan Yu grasped the stakes—Yang Conghan’s desperate bid to avoid marrying Feng required his supernatural core, the relic formed from a Boundary Sovereign’s demise.

“Why seek this relic?” he probed. “Rushed cultivation risks self-destruction.”

“Father’s qi deviation leaves him dying. Only two cures exist: Feng’s ancestral jade or your relic. Become my protector, and I’m yours.”

Guan Yu’s mind raced. Another clan crisis, another beauty’s plea—history repeating.

Sipping tea, he countered, “You know I’ve lost memories and power. Why approach me diminished?”

“We need the relic, not your past. In exchange...” Her trailing words hung between them.

Jinhua fumed silently, witnessing her beloved’s surrender to strategic seduction. Guan Yu’s relic meant salvation, but at what personal cost?

The game unfolded—a dance of survival, hidden motives, and reluctant attraction beneath City A’s glittering facade.
