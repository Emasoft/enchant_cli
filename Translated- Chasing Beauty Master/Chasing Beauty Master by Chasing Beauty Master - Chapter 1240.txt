“I know you previously harbored significant misunderstandings toward me,” Elder Dai said. “Though I am strict by nature, I am not as despicable as you imagined. When you gifted Si Qi a high-grade magical artifact, the entire Convergence Peak was grateful. Thus, I merely wished to express my gratitude through practical means, without any ulterior motives. I hope you can understand this.”

As she spoke, Elder Dai walked to the side of the room where two chests covered with red cloth stood. Guan Yu could not see what lay inside. She lifted the cloth, revealing an assortment of peculiar objects within.

“These are specialties of our Convergence Peak,” Elder Dai explained. “They cannot be found elsewhere. They are fruits formed from the metamorphosis of our peak’s flowers over many years. Not only are they sweet in taste, but they also possess the ability to clear internal heat and refresh the mind. However, their growth cycle is lengthy, resulting in scarce yields. Coincidentally, a batch has recently ripened, and I intend to gift them to your friends.”

Guan Yu remained uncertain whether Elder Dai’s gesture was sincere. If feigned, why offer such precious fruits? If genuine, her reputation left him wary.

Si Qi glanced at Guan Yu and added, “Elder Dai speaks the truth. These fruits are only bestowed upon disciples who have performed meritorious deeds. Even we rarely taste them. Normally, a single flower-fruit takes a year to mature, and its effects far surpass what she described. I know you still distrust her, but this time, her intentions seem earnest.”

Though Guan Yu did not entirely dismiss Si Qi’s words, Elder Dai’s notorious stinginess made her sudden generosity all the more suspect. Nevertheless, with gifts prepared and refusal deemed impolite, he acquiesced. “Since Elder Shi wishes to meet my friends, let us proceed to Front Return Peak. I thank you on their behalf.”

The rarity of the flower-fruits suggested deeper motives. Elder Dai’s eagerness confirmed this. “Let us depart at once,” she declared, instructing disciples Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian to carry the chests.

As they prepared to leave, Si Qi asked, “Shall I accompany you, Master?”

Elder Dai, noting Guan Yu’s evident fondness for Si Qi, nodded. “Join us. After matters conclude, you shall escort Guan Yu back to the rear mountain.”

The group traveled swiftly: Elder Dai leading, Si Qi and Guan Yu following, with Xiao Chun and Xiao Lian trailing behind. Upon reaching Front Return Peak, disciples alerted Elder Lu, who greeted them with forced courtesy. “Ah, Junior Sister Dai graces my humble abode! Forgive my lack of preparation.”

Memories of Elder Dai’s past wrath lingered—five years prior, she had nearly destroyed Hanging Central Peak after its head disciple attempted to assault Si Qi. Only Sect Leader Xuanming’s intervention had quelled her fury. Since then, none dared cross Convergence Peak’s disciples.

“I’ve returned Guan Yu as promised,” Elder Dai announced. “No thanks are necessary. Let us proceed.”

Elder Lu, aware of her designs, feigned cooperation. His disciple Ma Xiao guided them to the courtyard where Lin Qiaoqiao and Xiao Zhu awaited. The girls rushed to Guan Yu, Xiao Zhu flinging herself into his arms. “Where have you been? We’ve been worried sick!”

Lin Qiaoqiao, more restrained, eyed Si Qi suspiciously. “Who is she? Have you been with her all this time?”

Xiao Zhu chimed in, “Pretty as you are, don’t think you can snatch our Guan Yu! He already has plenty of admirers!”

Guan Yu sighed. “This is Senior Sister Si Qi. She escorted me back. Let us speak inside.”

In the guest room, Guan Yu found his aunt tending to her husband, whose pallid complexion alarmed him. “What’s wrong with Uncle?”

“A persistent fever,” his aunt replied. “We thought it a common chill, but…”

Elder Dai interjected, “Our flower-fruits may aid his recovery.” She gestured for Si Qi to offer one.

As Guan Yu checked his uncle’s pulse, Elder Lu feigned concern. “His condition is grave—likely exacerbated by delayed treatment. Was there prior heart trouble?”

Panic gripped Guan Yu. Without his usual spiritual energy, he turned to Elder Lu. “Please, examine him thoroughly!”

Elder Dai, impatient, pressed, “Out with it, Senior Brother! What ails him?”

“The fever masked a deeper malady,” Elder Lu intoned. “His heart weakness, neglected, now threatens his life.”

Meanwhile, Elder Dai’s gaze swept the room. “Where is Second Only to Wolf? I brought these fruits specially for him.”

Elder Lu smirked. “Ah, we shared wine earlier. He retired to rest.” His tone dripped with triumph—he’d ensured the coveted mercenary remained absent.

Unseen by others, Guan Yu’s aunt fed her husband the flower-fruit. Whether its famed properties would counter Elder Lu’s machinations remained uncertain—as did the true stakes of this convergence of ambitions.
