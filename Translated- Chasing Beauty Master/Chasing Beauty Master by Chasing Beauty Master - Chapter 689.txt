“What would the roar of a twelve-thousand-catty polar bear sound like? No one had ever heard it before. Everyone felt their ears were about to be deafened. They realized the polar bear wasn’t charging at Guanyu voluntarily—it seemed sucked toward him by some invisible force.

To casually summon over ten thousand catties with a single gesture? Perhaps only legendary deities could achieve such a feat.

The other four polar bears sensed danger. As their leader roared, their sixteen massive paws dug sharply into the ice, claws piercing deep, trying to halt their momentum—but it was too late.

Guanyu effortlessly lifted the bear, a hundred times his size, in his left palm. Golden light flashed across his body as he hurled the leader toward the other four bears.

Unable to dodge, the bears were struck by their leader, tumbling into a heap. Their collective roars sent snow swirling into the air like a thick fog, obscuring everyone’s vision.

Through the blizzard, Guanyu shouted, springing from the ice like a meteor into the bear cluster. The crisp *thwacks* of fists and kicks against blubbery flesh echoed, accompanied by pitiful howls—all ferocity from their charge now gone.

Minutes later, the snow settled, but the commotion continued. Every guard emerged from ice shelters to witness an unimaginable scene.

These past days, they’d faced these bears multiple times—always fleeing, losing lives with slightest misstep. Today, upon seeing five bears approach, they’d hidden, believing no human could oppose such beasts.

Yet now they saw a nimble figure dancing atop five white mounds. The bears lay prostrate like oversized puppies, massive heads tucked between paws, whimpering as Guanyu struck them repeatedly—not daring to resist.

“Husband, don’t kill the cubs! I want to keep them!” Xue Jing shouted, watching the bears’ helpless state.

Guanyu chuckled, leaping back to her side. Turning to the bears, he commanded: “Since someone spares your lives, stand up! Line up properly!”

The guards gaped as the bears—as if understanding—obediently rose, forming a fleshy wall in the snow.

Xue Jing circled them, frowning. “They’re cute, but too big. If only they were normal bear size...”

Guards stifled laughter inside shelters. Shrink giant bears? Preposterous!

Guanyu shook his head. “Normal bears are still large. I’ll make them puppy-sized. More fitting for your entourage.”

**Chapter 1751: Obedient Little Bear-Dogs**

Xue Jing clapped excitedly. “Really? Shrink them hundreds of times? Then I could cuddle them!”

Both Guanyu and nearby guards sweatdropped. These man-eating beasts... as pets? Madness!

Madder still—the man claiming to shrink them. Yet despite seeming insane, his power eclipsed everyone present combined.

The bears themselves understood. Previously, guards fled or hid in ice tunnels, occasionally trapping bears with boiling water. Today, expecting easy prey, they’d instead met Guanyu—who effortlessly manipulated their strongest member with godlike strength.

Post-mutation, these bears possessed rudimentary intelligence (equivalent to human five-year-olds). The humiliation of becoming lapdogs for a soft girl? Unbearable!

Guanyu sighed. “Even shrunken, their weight remains. You couldn’t lift them. Better keep them as companions—they’ll revert during danger, surprising attackers.”

Xue Jing’s disappointment turned to glee. “Then make them puppies now!”

As Guanyu approached, the lead bear roared defiance—death before dishonor! All five charged.

To Xue Jing, they were already tail-wagging pups. “Careful, doggies!” she cheered.

Guanyu vanished. Guards glimpsed azure whirlwinds encircling the bears—then five ice statues mid-lunge.

Approaching the lead bear (Xiong Da), Guanyu bathed it in gold and silver light. Despite being frozen, it howled piteously as its body shrank—fifty centimeters tall, eighty long, docilely nuzzling Xue Jing’s heels.

Guanyu had not only compressed its form but altered its temperament via spiritual energy, binding loyalty to Xue Jing. Probing its mind, he discovered existing mental tampering—explaining their pack behavior and savagery.

Witnessing the impossible, guards emerged, applauding as four more bears transformed. Xue Jing tried lifting them (futilely) before naming them Xiong Da to Xiong Wu—Obedient Bear-Dogs.

**Chapter 1752: Ice Cavern**

Initially dismissing the couple as arrogant youths, guards now revered Guanyu. American leader John invited them into his shelter, offering whiskey.

“Sir, may I know your origin? China? Japan? Korea?”

“Guanyu. From China.”

Gasps erupted—this was *the* Guanyu, Earth’s first returnee from divine ruins, China’s legendary hero! Apologies flowed as guards realized their earlier disrespect.

The camp housed 368 subjects—criminals, addicts, prostitutes—overseen by 28 guards. Recently, bear attacks halted their mutation experiments. Though hating the bears, none dared oppose Guanyu’s pets now.

Guanyu explained: “These bears were controlled. The real enemy manipulates them. Help me find the mastermind.”

Shocked guards agreed. Guanyu inquired about bear hideouts. John described a deep ice cavern—likely shielding them from detection.

Guanyu’s eyes narrowed. This cavern might connect to his true objective—the Arctic Origin. After neutralizing the bears, retrieving this primordial force was crucial.

**Chapter 1753: Jones**

While Guanyu fought, other barracks remained eerily quiet—odd for housing volatile subjects. Guarding methods puzzled him.

Following directions northward, Guanyu headed toward the cavern. Temperatures there plunged below -100°C during polar night—fatal for normal humans, explaining the high mortality rate.

He vowed to eliminate remaining bears and uncover their controller—whether human or supernatural. Only then would this outpost be safe.
