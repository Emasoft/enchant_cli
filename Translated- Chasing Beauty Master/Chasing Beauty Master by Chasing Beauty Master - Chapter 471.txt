“In this mortal world, there are few places left where we can truly act. I can’t be bothered to search elsewhere. Within this ancient tomb lies something our Demonic Sect desires. This time, our Demon Emperor Sect will cooperate with the Evil God Cult to enter. Once inside, we’ll settle matters. What say you?” Qintian stroked his chin, his gaze inscrutable as he regarded Guanyu. Though his tone was casual, the implications of his words carried profound weight.

Having spoken, Qintian turned abruptly and left—his departure as puzzling as his sudden arrival. Guanyu narrowed his eyes slightly but said nothing. He instructed Lin Dong to escort Liu Shilei and the three other women back to his residence in the capital.

“Now that everyone’s rested, let’s convene. What are your thoughts on Qintian’s appearance today?” Guanyu surveyed the four women seated around him, along with Zhang Ziran and Lin Dong, before recounting Qintian’s message verbatim.

“Strange. It almost feels like he came to warn us of the Demonic Sect’s arrival in the capital. What exactly is Qintian scheming?” Liu Shilei spoke first, her skepticism natural yet superficial—a reflection of her limited understanding of the Demonic Sect’s inner workings.

“Not so strange. The Demonic Sect thrives on intrigue. Though the Demon Emperor Sect has long dominated the Three Sacred Sects, perhaps Qintian resents being forced to assist Ren Qiansha this time and aims to undermine him.” Zhang Ziran dismissed Qintian’s words lightly, failing to grasp Guanyu’s urgency in summoning them to the capital over this matter.

“Ah, why am I so concerned? Because I know Qintian well. He’s an anomaly within the Demonic Sect—loyal to comrades, honorable to allies. Though born of darkness, his conduct rivals that of the righteous sects. Recall how Qingfu and Xiang Tiansheng died by my hand. Had Ren Qiansha intervened, they might still live.” Guanyu smiled faintly. Zhang Ziran’s dismissiveness was expected, but he hadn’t gathered them here for idle chatter.

“We know all this, Guanyu. What’s your point?” Zhang Ziran sipped his tea, his expression betraying skepticism toward Guanyu’s assessment of Qintian.

“My point is simple: Qintian deliberately leaked information to us because he seeks vengeance against Ren Qiansha. The methods are straightforward—using us, acting alone, or collaborating with us. I believe he wants an alliance to eliminate Ren Qiansha.” Guanyu revealed his theory with calm certainty.

“Pfft—*cough*—!” Zhang Ziran spat out his tea, staring at Guanyu as if he’d lost his mind.

“Husband, what basis do you have for this? If Qintian hates Ren Qiansha so deeply, why not kill him himself? Allying with us—righteous sect members—would brand him a traitor in the Demonic Sect!” Liu Shilei voiced the question burning in Zhang Ziran’s mind as the latter flushed crimson.

“My reasoning is twofold. First, Qintian left a mark on Lin Dong. Observe.” Golden light shimmered in Guanyu’s palm. Lin Dong’s face contorted in pain as tendrils of black mist seeped from his nostrils, coalescing into words:

**Chapter 1192: Evil God’s Blood Sacrifice**

“Beware Blood Asura within the tomb. Alliance advisable.” Zhang Ziran murmured, his eyes glazing over at “Blood Asura” before widening in dawning terror.

“Blood Asura? Do such creatures still exist?” Within Guanyu’s consciousness, Jingang materialized—the usually jovial bald figure now grimly serious.

“Who knows? But if they do, we face grave trouble. Let me investigate.” Guanyu’s mind cleared. So this was why Qintian sought cooperation—Blood Asura.

“Zhang Ziran, you know what Blood Asura are. Sending us into such danger—is this a death sentence?” Though perturbed, Guanyu remained composed. He trusted Zhang Ziran wouldn’t knowingly endanger them; likely, the Blood Asura’s presence was news to him too.

“My ancestor avoided burial in our ancestral hall precisely because of this Blood Asura. Our clan records state it was destroyed millennia ago! How could it still live?” Recovering his composure, Zhang Ziran countered swiftly.

“Guanyu, Brother Zhang—what exactly are Blood Asura? Stop speaking in riddles!” The four women, novices in cultivation matters despite their time at Fumo Sect’s training halls, pressed for explanation.

“Blood Asura are beings born of hell’s blood sea—innately powerful, rivaling dragons and phoenixes. The ones we speak of are artificially created.” Zhang Ziran chose his words carefully, outlining their horrors.

“Correct. Asura embody slaughter, Blood Asura being their pinnacle. This supreme Demonic Sect art, descended from Ancestor Minghe’s Blood God Scripture, once terrorized the cultivation world until Shu Mountain eradicated it. Yet the methods persist.” Guanyu continued while silently consulting Jingang about countermeasures.

“Two millennia ago during the Three Kingdoms chaos, my Zhang ancestors rose to prominence. Our founding patriarch’s first foe was the Blood Coagulation Sect’s leader who achieved Blood Asura form. The Blood God Scripture’s cultivation warps the mind—practitioners become soulless slaughterers. This tomb’s Blood Asura escaped annihilation by three Soul Projection and four Spirit Division experts. Even alive today, it’s likely weakened to Golden Core or even Foundation Establishment level. Brother Guanyu, this shouldn’t trouble you?” Zhang Ziran’s tentative glance betrayed unease.

Though this was his request, incomplete intelligence could prove fatal.

“I’m not afraid, but complications arise. These soulless corpses are precisely what the Evil God Cult desires. Should Ren Qiansha obtain it...” Blood Asura, while formidable, carried exploitable weaknesses.

“So your meaning is...?” Zhang Ziran paled, realizing the stakes—if misjudgment harmed the women, no apology would suffice.

*Ding-dong.*

As Guanyu prepared to elaborate, the doorbell rang. Few knew his location; the timing spoke volumes.

“Leopard! Long time. How fares life?” During Guanyu’s seclusion, Leopard had returned to Dragon Group, his status transformed. Their reunion involved a hearty back-thumping embrace.

Civilians never grasp soldierly bonds—trusting another with your life forges unbreakable ties.

“Well enough. Apologies for intruding so soon after your arrival. A terrorist attack occurred at Central Square—Dragon Group requests your aid.” Leopard’s urgency overrode etiquette as he briefed the group.

“Bombings by brainwashed individuals? Casualties?” Guanyu’s calm voice belied chilling fury that dropped the room’s temperature.

“A dozen civilians dead. One bomber’s device malfunctioned—we captured him. They grow reckless!” Leopard’s fists clenched—trained to protect nation and people, failure stung deeply.

“So Ren Qiansha makes his move. Awakening Blood Asura requires Blood Condensation Pearls... initiating blood sacrifices already? Leopard, inform Dragon Group I’ll resolve this within five days. Bring the prisoner.” Guanyu’s calm returned. This battle would culminate in the tomb—the mortal realm couldn’t withstand full-scale conflict.

**Chapter 1193: Killing to Shock**

“This is the Evil God Cultist? Seems docile enough.” Guanyu observed the soundproofed chamber—walls padded with suicide-prevention materials.

“Appearances deceive.” Long Aotian’s sudden appearance startled Guanyu. The Dragon Group leader remained an enigma—his cultivation sect and power level perpetually obscured.

“Let’s see then. The Evil God Cult... heh.” Setting aside Long Aotian’s mysteries—every nation hid its dragons—Guanyu entered.

*Crack.*

Guanyu reset the cultist’s dislocated jaw. Instead of desperation, calm dullness greeted him—a pretty young woman, provocatively dressed but vacant-eyed, drooling like an imbecile.

“A girl? Quite beautiful. Ren Qiansha—what do you want? This crude intimidation?” Guanyu studied her mockingly.

“Heh. Retrieve items from that Zhang family tomb, or I’ll turn this city upside down.” The girlish voice dripped with corruption.

“Threats? How tiresome. Commander Long, request Dragon Group’s full cooperation.” Guanyu vanished, reappearing behind the cultist in a golden flash.

“Argh! What sorcery?!” Ren Qiansha’s furious roar replaced the girl’s voice.

“Childish soul puppetry before Fumo Sect’s light? Pathetic.” Jingang strutted in Guanyu’s mindscape. Though weak in soul cultivation, Guanyu’s artifact spirit compensated flawlessly.

“Enough gloating. Did the seed take root?” Guanyu exhaled—soul battles unnerved him most.

“His soul’s wounded. Even with faith nourishment, six months’ recovery at minimum. No wonder he feared Fumo Sect’s arrays—direct confrontation would annihilate him.” Jingang grinned. Such complete elemental counters were rare.

“Commander Long, I’ve located Ren Qiansha’s hideout. Injured, he won’t flee far. I’ve other matters here—success to your mission.” Guanyu feigned exhaustion from the soul clash. None could challenge his pretense.

“Why won’t he assist? A trap?” Agent One, ever hostile, muttered.

“Capital security is our duty. He assists voluntarily. Cross him again, and your deaths will be meaningless.” Long Aotian’s calm proclamation silenced dissenters. Guanyu’s display had proven his transcendent power.

---

Returning home, Guanyu reconvened the group. With Ren Qiansha occupied, urgency dictated immediate action.

“The situation escalates. Ren Qiansha’s movements suggest limited time. Can we enter the tomb now?” Guanyu pressed.

“Very well. My ancestor’s legacy spans beyond borders—rumor says foreign conflicts left him gravely wounded before dying here. Proceed cautiously.” Zhang Ziran clutched a violet dagger, hesitating.

The Zhang Clan hadn’t anticipated their ancestor’s tomb hosting such dangers. Recent spiritual fluctuations alone prompted investigation.

Prioritizing safety, Guanyu sent the women to Fumo Sect’s sanctuary. Opportunities beckoned, but lethal risks followed.

---

“Here we go. Brace yourself!” Zhang Ziran slashed the air with his dagger, ripping a blue portal. They leapt through as it vanished.

*Whoosh.*

Disoriented, Guanyu gagged on thick blood-tainted air—then saw the crimson glow.

“SHIELD!” Jingang roared. Golden light enveloped them.

**Chapter 1194: Blood Asura Emerges**

“Alive?! Zhang Ziran—this ‘ancestral tomb’ resembles a Blood Asura’s lair!” The protective aura thinned under relentless bloody corrosion.

“I don’t know! Brother, I’ve doomed us!” Zhang Ziran watched their defenses wane.

“Damn it, that’s not helpful!” Guanyu assessed their perimeter while querying Jingang about the shield’s durability.
