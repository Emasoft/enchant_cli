“You need not give this to me; keep it yourself,” Elder Jiu said. “Such an important item—if it were lost in my care, I could never repay its worth.”

Guanyu froze, puzzled by Elder Jiu’s words. *Does he no longer wish to help? Weren’t we just in agreement moments ago? How could his stance shift so abruptly?*

Xuanming explained, “Guanyu, since Elder Jiu has agreed to assist you, you must reside here for a time.”

“Why?” Guanyu asked curiously. “I already said I’d cultivate at Qianhui Peak. My friends are there. Why must I stay here? What schemes are you old-timers brewing?”

“Because the Imperial Seal has now acknowledged you as its master,” Xuanming continued. “When storing spells within it, your presence is essential. Elder Jiu can only perform the rituals if you open the seal.”

Guanyu nodded. “Ah, I see. Very well, I’ll stay. But I must first return to inform my friends, lest they worry.”

Elder Lu interjected, “No need. I’ll notify them when I return. It’s troublesome for you to travel back and forth.”

“No,” Guanyu shook his head. “If Second Only to Wolf and Lin Qiaoqiao don’t see me personally, they’ll suspect I’ve been imprisoned here. I must explain matters myself—and there’s something I need to entrust to Second Only to Wolf.”

“My friends aren’t easily placated. I fear they’ll stir trouble. I must reassure them of my situation. However…” Guanyu hesitated. “When I return, I’ll travel with Master. I refuse to traverse that cliff path with Elder Lu again—it’s too perilous.”

Xuanming chuckled. “That path only *seems* dangerous. Once familiar, you’ll find it safe.”

“Regardless, I won’t take it! The ascent terrified me—I broke into cold sweat. I’d rather die than walk it again. I’ll accompany you, Master,” Guanyu insisted.

“Very well,” Xuanming acquiesced. “Return with me. After settling matters, you may retrace this route. I’ll arrange for Ling Su to accompany you then.”

“My gratitude, Master, and to Elder Jiu for his aid.” Guanyu bowed.

The journey from the back mountains to Hushou Peak proved arduous. Guanyu trudged behind Xuanming for nearly an hour across rugged terrain. Though the vistas were breathtaking and paths relatively stable—no sheer cliffs—fatigue weighed heavily on his qi-deprived body.

At Zhongtian Platform, a figure approached. “Guanyu, this is your senior brother Ling Su. He’ll escort you to Qianhui Peak.”

“Greetings, Senior Brother. Thank you, Master.” Guanyu clasped his hands.

“Ling Su, accompany Guanyu to Qianhui Peak and bring him back afterward,” Xuanming instructed before turning to Guanyu. “Do you recall our return route? If not, seek me.”

“I should remember. If not, Senior Brother Ling Su can guide me.”

“Impossible!” Ling Su interjected haughtily. “The back mountains are forbidden to ordinary disciples like me.”

Guanyu finally appraised the man—tall and lanky, standing nearly 190cm to his own 185cm. Though Ling Su’s face seemed plain, his eyes gleamed with disdain, as if looking down on gutter trash. *Arrogant cur! Why would Master accept such a disciple?* Guanyu seethed internally.

Xuanming nodded. “Indeed. Only Guanyu holds special permission. Ling Su, assist him with sword flight since he hasn’t learned the technique yet.”

“So the junior brother knows nothing?” Ling Su’s smile turned sly. “Rest assured, Master. I’ll deliver him safely.”

As Xuanming departed, Ling Su drew his sword. “Grip the blade tightly, Junior Brother. Wouldn’t want you…*falling* mid-flight.” His benign mask slipped, revealing venomous glee.

Guanyu’s misgivings surged. *This snake might sabotage me midair!* Yet options were scarce. Resigned, he grasped the sword, bracing for treachery.

Chapter 3143: Mercy, Noble Heroine!

Emerging from Zhongtian Platform’s forest at nightfall, Guanyu found himself lost in unfamiliar terrain—rolling hills blanketed in vibrant flowers beneath a moonlit manor. Exhausted and directionless, he approached the illuminated compound.

“Halt! Who dares trespass here?” A cold female voice pierced the darkness as something sharp pressed against his back. *A weapon?!*

Guanyu calculated disarming maneuvers but hesitated—his reflexes weren’t what they once were. “Mercy, noble heroine! Let’s discuss this calmly!”

“State your name and purpose!” The blade dug deeper.

“I’m Guanyu, newly apprenticed under Xuanming of Hushou Peak. I lost my way to Qianhui—”

“Lies!” A vicious kick buckled his knees. “Elder Xuanming accepts no disciples! Why aren’t you wearing sect robes? You’re clearly a thief!”

Bound by mystical restraints, Guanyu groaned. “I swear! Take me to your leader—he’ll confirm my identity!”

Another kick propelled him forward. “Move! My master will extract the truth.”

As they marched, Guanyu seethed. *When I regain my strength, you’ll regret these strikes, shrew!* Aloud, he tried reasoning: “Noble heroine, if you know sword flight, could you—”

“Silence! No tricks!” The blade jabbed warningly.

Guanyu sighed. *Better to face sect discipline than Second Only to Wolf’s rampage if I don’t return…* Resigned, he trudged toward the flower-crowned peak, each step compounding his vow: *I’ll master cultivation if it’s the last thing I do!*

Chapter 3144: Truths Unheeded

Bound before Aggregation Peak’s hall, Guanyu faced his accuser—a sharp-featured young woman whose beauty was marred by suspicion. “I’ve caught a spy, Master!”

The sect leader frowned. “Explain yourself, outsider.”

“I’m Xuanming’s disciple! Elder Lu brought me to—”

“Preposterous!” The heroine kicked him again. “He claims the Imperial Seal chose him!”

The leader’s eyes narrowed. “The Imperial Seal? Show me.”

As Guanyu summoned the artifact’s aura, the hall erupted in gasps. The heroine paled. “Impossible! How could a novice…?”

“Enough, Mei’er,” the leader commanded. “Fetch Elder Xuanming. Let truth be revealed.”

Guanyu met the woman’s shocked gaze, silently vowing: *You’ll regret those kicks, Mei’er. Just wait.*
