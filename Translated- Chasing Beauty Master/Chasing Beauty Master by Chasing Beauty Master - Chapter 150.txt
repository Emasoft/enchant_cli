Before Guan Yu could speak, Niu Le beside him spoke up with slight displeasure, “Brother, I’m not bragging, but my brother here can cure uremia with his bare hands without kidney transplants, revive the nearly dead—even Hua Tuo reborn couldn’t match his skills.”

Xiao Xiong, despite his vast experience, stared wide-eyed at Guan Yu and rasped, “True?”

Guan Yu smiled faintly, neither confirming nor denying.

Niu Le rolled his eyes at Xiao Xiong’s skepticism.

Xiao Xiong took a deep breath, his mind roiling like stormy seas. He didn’t doubt Guan Yu’s claims—no one would dare fabricate such boasts, as lies would swiftly unravel. What manner of divine being was this youth before him, capable of such miracles?

Guan Yu interjected, “Enough talk. Let me treat Niu Le first.”

As he unwrapped the bandages around Niu Le’s knee, revealing the swollen, purplish-black joint, Guan Yu sucked in a sharp breath and cursed, “That bastard.”

Still muttering, he placed his hands over the injury. Xiao Xiong watched unblinkingly, knowing seeing was believing.

Closing his eyes, Guan Yu activated his healing system. A cooling energy flowed from his arm into Niu Le’s knee, transforming the burning pain into icy relief. Under Xiao Xiong’s astonished gaze, the discoloration and swelling visibly receded.

Five seconds later, Guan Yu opened his eyes, smiling at the half-healed knee. Niu Le preened, “See that? My brother’s skills. Still doubt?”

Xiao Xiong swallowed hard, his gaze toward Guan Yu now reverent. This defied all logic—like something from TV dramas where masters cured ailments with a touch.

Downplaying his ability, Guan Yu explained, “An old hermit taught me qigong as a child.”

Xiao Xiong rolled his eyes at the flimsy excuse but refrained from pressing.

As the trio conversed, none noticed the black-and-white banded snake slithering unseen up Niu Le’s back, its venomous fangs bared in the shadows.

Spotting the lurking danger, Guan Yu’s expression darkened. “Niu Le,” he said urgently, “let’s teach that Touhao’er a lesson.”

Niu Le waved him off, “Leave this to me. Can’t have you meddling—I’d lose face if I can’t handle such trifles.”

Guan Yu nearly choked. Since when did prison time become something to cherish?

As the snake emerged from Niu Le’s collar, poised to strike his carotid artery, Guan Yu’s face paled. Desperately activating his pet system, the copper coin’s inscription blazed.

An imperceptible connection snapped into place. “STOP!” Guan Yu mentally roared.

The snake froze mid-strike, fangs millimeters from skin. Guan Yu exhaled shakily—the upgraded system worked.

Niu Le blinked at Guan Yu’s sudden pallor. Xiao Xiong followed his gaze and shouted, “Don’t move! A venomous snake’s on your neck!”

As Niu Le froze, Guan Yu laughed weakly, “It’s safe now. Move freely.”

The snake remained docile despite Niu Le’s twisting. Xiao Xiong gaped.

“Now he forces my hand,” Guan Yu growled, eyes glinting.

**Chapter 369: The Snake Charmer**

Tension radiated from Guan Yu like coiled springs. Xiao Xiong’s gaze hardened toward Touhao’er’s direction, while Niu Le puzzled, “Why’s there a snake on me?”

“Winter snakes don’t wander,” Xiao Xiong snapped. “This was assassination.”

Realization dawned on Niu Le, his glare promising violence. Across the yard, Touhao’er frowned—why wasn’t his target dead yet?

“Silver-ringed snake,” Xiao Xiong identified. “Painless bite, respiratory paralysis. Your attacker’s a master handler.” He eyed Guan Yu meaningfully. “As are you.”

Guan Yu ignored the implication, fury simmering. Without his system, Niu Le would’ve died an “accidental” death.

When Niu Le lunged for revenge, Guan Yu stopped him. “We’ll return his poison.”

The snake slithered obediently to Guan Yu’s arm, nuzzling his palm. Niu Le stammered, “H-how’s it so tame?!”

Smiling grimly, Guan Yu sent the serpent toward Touhao’er. Xiao Xiong marveled—this surpassed any animal trainer he’d known.

The snake reached its former master unnoticed. When it struck, Touhao’er’s scream drew stares.

“Look! Boss’ pet’s playing with him,” someone chuckled, oblivious.

But as fangs sank into Touhao’er’s neck, laughter died.

**Chapter 370: Energy Depletion?**

Touhao’er collapsed, consciousness fading with one final thought: *Was it him?*

Chaos erupted as guards waded in with batons. Amidst the bedlam, Guan Yu’s trio stood untouched.

“How’d you do it?” Niu Le pressed later.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Learned beast-taming from a mountain hermit.”

Even Niu Le saw through the lie. “What’s next?”

Guan Yu’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. The copper coin’s energy reserves concerned him—controlling the snake had drained it alarmingly. But for now, vengeance was served.
