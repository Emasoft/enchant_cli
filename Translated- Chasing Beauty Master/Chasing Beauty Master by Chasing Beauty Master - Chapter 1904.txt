After taking a sip of wine from the small cup, a fiery trail burned from her throat down the esophagus to her stomach, leaving an intensely uncomfortable sensation.

The pungent flavor sent her into a fit of incessant coughing. “Cough, cough, cough…”

Lord Wan Hong rose with concern. “Miss Duan, are you alright? You clearly aren’t accustomed to drinking. There’s no need to force yourself.”

“Please don’t worry, Lord Wan Hong—cough, cough—I’m fine. Everyone must start somewhere,” Duan Ruxue replied, her cheeks now flushed crimson after the drink.

“This is my first attempt. Until today, I’d never tasted alcohol. My family forbids women—whether mistresses or servants—from drinking. It’s a strict rule,” she explained.

“If that’s the case, why break the tradition now?” Lord Wan Hong said mildly. “Drinking has no bearing on our discussion. There’s no need to strain yourself.”

He believed the success of any negotiation depended on mutual understanding, not wine. Agreements could flourish without a drop of liquor, while disputes would falter even amid the finest feasts.

Watching Duan Ruxue force down the potent liquor, he felt a pang of sympathy. Her delicate constitution could scarcely handle such a strong drink, and the effort seemed unnecessary.

“Many business dealings hinge on shared drinks,” Duan Ruxue countered. “I’ve always abstained, which often leads to awkwardness. Today, I thought to change that.”

“Mastering this skill might benefit the Duan family’s interests. Even if it defies tradition, pragmatism outweighs old rules.”

Her words carried a tinge of resignation that surprised Lord Wan Hong. She spoke of obligation, not desire.

The Duan family lacked male heirs, leaving Ruxue to manage their enterprises alone as her father’s health declined. Clients often expected convivial drinking during negotiations, but she had steadfastly refused, fearing both inebriation and lost opportunities.

“There are countless ways to conduct business without alcohol,” Lord Wan Hong advised. “A young woman risking intoxication in public courts danger—especially one of the Capital’s Twin Beauties. Many would exploit such vulnerability.”

“I’m well aware,” she replied. “I’ve rejected countless toasts, even at the cost of partnerships. Expansion matters, but never at the expense of safety.”

Refilling both cups, she continued, “Today is different. I trust your honor, Lord Wan Hong. Even if I lose consciousness, I believe you’d return me safely home. Let’s toast again!”

“You overestimate me,” he demurred. “We’re barely acquainted. What if I’m the threat? Alone here, with the Capital’s renowned beauty—how could any man resist temptation?”

“You jest,” Ruxue laughed. “The ‘Twin Beauties’ title means nothing. Your two beloveds outshine me entirely. I doubt I even register in your eyes.”

“Modesty doesn’t suit you,” Lord Wan Hong countered. “Your beauty is universally acknowledged—a fact beyond dispute.” He then called for tea, hoping to sober her.

“Replacing wine with tea—does Lord Wan Hong pity me?” Ruxue asked bluntly.

“Perhaps. I dislike seeing you distressed. Solutions exist without self-inflicted hardship.”

“Because I consider you family.” Her words bridged their distance. “I invited you today to discuss a proposal.”

Despite her youth, Ruxue was a seasoned negotiator. Her teetotalism had hitherto protected her reputation, but tonight’s calculated indulgence served a purpose: securing Lord Wan Hong’s sympathy for her request.

“Speak freely,” he urged.

Settling into her seat, Ruxue broached, “Rumor says you and Prince Consort Jiang seek the East Sea Treasure. Is this true?”

Lord Wan Hong nodded. “Indeed. Surprised you’ve heard. We’ve found no leads thus far.”

“My family hails from a coastal hamlet near the East Sea—or what was once a vast lake. Decades ago, we relocated to the capital. Grandfather spoke of it, but he’s long passed.”

“Could your father recall its location?” Lord Wan Hong pressed. Any clue, however faint, merited pursuit.

“Father retains some memory. I could inquire.” Her tone shifted subtly, hinting at unspoken terms.

“Name your price for this information,” Lord Wan Hong probed.

“Straight to business!” Ruxue chuckled. “I offer exclusive insights in exchange for partnership. The East Sea Treasure’s wealth is legendary—I seek only a fair share.”

Though intrigued, Lord Wan Hong cautioned, “Prince Consort Jiang leads this endeavor. His consent is essential.”

“Yet your influence decides,” Ruxue countered. “His compliance follows your approval. My resources could accelerate your search—worth considering, no?”

**Chapter 5005: No Objections**

Recognizing her astuteness, Lord Wan Hong conceded. Jiang Yuanhai often deferred to his judgment, and Ruxue’s aid might prove invaluable.

“Should you deem our contribution worthy,” Ruxue added, “we’ll accept whatever portion you and the Prince Consort allot. My true aim is strengthening ties between our houses.”

“Very well,” Lord Wan Hong agreed. “Welcome as my partner. Should we succeed, your clan won’t be slighted.”

“My gratitude, Lord Wan Hong.” Radiating triumph, Ruxue drained another cup, her speech slurring slightly. “I’ve always wished for an elder brother—one as principled as you.”

“And I’d value a sister as clever as you,” he reciprocated.

“Then cease calling me ‘Miss Duan.’ Address me as ‘Ruxue younger sister.’”

“As you wish, ‘Ruxue younger sister.’ You may call me ‘Elder Brother Wan.’”

Despite her intoxication, Ruxue maintained poise. “Visit our estate someday. Father can elaborate on our ancestral home.”

Lord Wan Hong agreed, adding, “Introduce me to your tailor. His craftsmanship—particularly your gown—intrigues me.”

“This ‘cheongsam,’ as he calls it, initially seemed too bold,” Ruxue remarked, smoothing the dress. “But he insisted on its elegance.”

“In my homeland, this timeless design symbolizes mature allure,” Lord Wan Hong smiled. “Its charm lies in precise cuts.”

“How insightful! You and he shall converse endlessly about fabrics.”

As they parted, Ruxue mused on Lord Wan Hong’s integrity—a rare virtue in the capital’s cutthroat circles. Were it not for his existing attachments, she might have pursued deeper ties. For now, kinship sufficed, anchoring their fledgling alliance.
