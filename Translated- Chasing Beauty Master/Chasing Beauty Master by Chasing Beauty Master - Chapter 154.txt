While he was still caught in excitement without having time to pull up his pants, the bathroom door swung open again. Guan Yu instinctively turned his head, only to see two blushing faces.

The three stared at each other in mutual mortification.

Zhao Jinger reacted first, covering her eyes.

Guan Yu felt a pang of embarrassment and swiftly pulled up his pants with lightning speed.

He wanted to bang his head against the wall. What good was regaining his strength when his private parts had been exposed to both women? How could he face anyone now?

Feng Xin raised an eyebrow, her radiant smile carrying a dangerous edge in Guan Yu’s eyes.

“You can pull up your pants by yourself?” Feng Xin chuckled.

Guan Yu explained hastily, “You startled me! You know how human potential can be triggered in emergencies. Why’d you barge in so suddenly anyway?”

He couldn’t admit to having regained his strength now—how would he explain that? Claiming an electric shock miraculously cured him sounded absurd.

Only after Guan Yu fastened his pants did Zhao Jinger peek through her fingers, cheeks burning. “Sister Xin and I got worried when you took so long... We thought something happened. Who knew you’d been... holding it in for so long? You didn’t get... impotent, did you?”

Guan Yu staggered as if struck, veins bulging on his forehead. How could this innocent girl harp on such an embarrassing topic?

Feng Xin chimed in, “Maybe a doctor should confirm that.”

Guan Yu gaped. Since when did they care so much about his... performance?

Zhao Jinger’s next whisper nearly made him spit blood:

“Your skin’s so fair, Brother... Why is... that part so dark?” She stole a furtive glance downward before quickly looking away.

Even Feng Xin flushed, though upon reflection, the observation held some truth.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu changed the subject. “Sis, did you bring food? I’m starving.”

His smile froze upon seeing the thermos’ contents—lumpy black masses resembling charcoal.

**Chapter 378: The Lower Limit of Culinary Skills**

Guan Yu stared at the unidentifiable charred lumps, his expression shifting through shades of disbelief. Entrusting Feng Xin with meals now seemed catastrophically foolish.

This was just the first layer. He dreaded imagining the lower tiers. Consuming these might rival being poisoned by a silver-ringed snake.

Turning to Feng Xin with strained cheer, he asked, “Did you... make all this?”

Feng Xin coughed awkwardly. “You said hospital food was awful, so I cooked myself! My first attempt—you’re so lucky! Go on, try it!”

She beamed expectantly.

Guan Yu gulped. “What... dish is this?”

“Braised pork ribs with scallions!”

*Since when do scallion ribs resemble coal briquettes?*

“Let me feed you!” Feng Xin cheerfully lifted a “rib” toward his mouth.

Torn between sparing her feelings and preserving his stomach, Guan Yu stalled, “Actually, I’m not hungry anymore—”

Feng Xin’s face darkened. “What? Ashamed of my cooking?” She slammed the chopsticks down.

Guan Yu shot Zhao Jinger a pleading look, but she merely shrugged sympathetically.

“After all my effort...” Feng Xin muttered theatrically, “At least it’s better than what you made Jinger.”

Defeated, Guan Yu surrendered. “Your presentation outshines mine! Who else gets personally fed by Sister Xin? I’m suddenly famished!”

The flattery worked. Feng Xin gleefully offered another lump. “See how good I am to you? Open wide!”

Guan Yu clenched his jaw and accepted the “rib.” His eyelids twitched violently—the meat tasted like salted charcoal, unbearably briny.

*This isn’t braised ribs—it’s salt-crusted hell.*

Forcing a smile, he choked it down whole. “Delicious! You’ve got real talent!”

“Really?” Feng Xin’s eyes sparkled. “I worried it looked bad, but flavor matters most! Try the next layer!”

Guan Yu’s stomach churned. He’d rather face another venomous snake bite—at least that just required fainting.

The next morning, Guan Yu awoke to Du Xiaojuan’s adoring gaze. “You’re so handsome,” she murmured.

“Then why not look forever?” he teased, pulling her into a kiss. Their embrace deepened until—

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

“Lazybones! You’ll be late for school!” Feng Xin’s voice pierced through the door.

Guan Yu glared at the interruption. *Since when did I care about attendance?*

Flanked by two campus beauties, Guan Yu basked in envious stares. Let the onlookers grind their teeth—he reveled in their jealousy.
