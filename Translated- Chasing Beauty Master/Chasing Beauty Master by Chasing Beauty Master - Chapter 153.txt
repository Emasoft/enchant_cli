The atmosphere was slightly awkward. Guan Yu didn’t want to dwell on the matter and asked, “Jing’er, what time is it? I’m getting hungry.”

“Ah! Hungry? It’s not dinner time yet. Let me find you something to eat.” Zhao Jing’er rose hurriedly, ready to dash out.

“Hospital food doesn’t suit me. Let’s call Sister Xin instead. If she finds out I woke up without informing her… you know how she gets.” Guan Yu quickly added, “Having her here might ease the tension between us.”

“But what if Sister Xu and Sister Wenqing come too?” Zhao Jing’er tilted her head.

Guan Yu sighed wryly. Fortune and misfortune were two sides of the same coin; what’s meant to come would come. Strangely, he felt at peace. “Just call Sister Feng Xin. You explain it to her.”

The call connected instantly. Before Guan Yu could speak, an icy voice snapped through the receiver: “Guan Yu! Not dead yet, I see. Finally remembered to call?”

He rolled his eyes. How did Feng Xin know it was him using Jing’er’s phone? Adopting an ingratiating tone, he said, “Sis, I called the moment I woke up! Where are you? I’m starving and can’t stomach hospital food.”

“You expect me to believe that?” Feng Xin retorted, her Mercedes speeding toward First Hospital. “Give me half an hour.” The line went dead as her car screeched into a U-turn, accelerator floored.

Another call followed. “Sister Lan, prepare these ingredients. I’ll cook when I return.”

At the Feng residence, Old Master Feng watched his granddaughter wreak havoc in the kitchen—smoke, burnt smells, and clattering pans composing a chaotic symphony. Having never seen her cook before, he pitied Guan Yu. Yet his wrinkled face relaxed contentedly—this chaos cemented Guan Yu’s position as their family’s future son-in-law. All he needed now was a great-grandchild.

Unaware of the storm his casual request had unleashed, Guan Yu joked with Zhao Jing’er to dispel the lingering awkwardness. Gradually, the earlier intimate moment faded from her mind.

But soon, Guan Yu’s complexion flushed unnaturally. The IV fluids exacerbated his full bladder. With only Jing’er present and no strength to reach the bathroom alone, he clenched his teeth. Having just eased her shyness, he couldn’t bear to ask for help.

Noticing his distress, Zhao Jing’er panicked. “Brother! Should I call the doctor?”

Guan Yu shook his head vehemently.

“Brother, please talk to me!” Her voice quivered.

Under relentless questioning, Guan Yu finally confessed his predicament.

Zhao Jing’er blinked, her expression shifting through conflicting emotions. Watching him squirm like an ant on hot coals, she whispered resolutely: “Let me help you to the bathroom. Books say… holding it too long causes… impotence.”

Guan Yu froze mid-breath. Since when did this innocent girl learn such things?

**Chapter 376: Karma Arrives**

Zhao Jing’er’s cheeks burned under Guan Yu’s stunned gaze—she’d stumbled upon that knowledge accidentally. Pushing aside embarrassment, she reasoned: *With so many women around him, I can’t let him suffer damage. Besides, he exhausted himself healing me… Stop overthinking!*

Had Guan Yu’s energy allowed accessing his detection system, he might have died of shame knowing her thoughts.

Supporting his weight, Zhao Jing’er helped him sit up. Each movement strained her frail frame. Guan Yu’s heart warmed, unaware her determination stemmed from safeguarding his “future capabilities.”

“Hold my shoulders,” she instructed, ducking under his arm. Their precarious balance shattered when Guan Yu overexerted—both tumbled to the floor, his face buried between her breasts, lips meeting hers again.

Before either could react, the door burst open. Feng Xin stood frozen, clutching a thermal container, face darkening.

“Sis! Help!” Guan Yu pleaded.

“You lecher!” Feng Xin exploded. “Molesting Jing’er? Have prison thugs taught you nothing?”

“It’s not—”

“Save it!” She cut off Zhao Jing’er’s tearful attempt. Her glare shifted to their still-entangled forms. “Can’t even control yourself with us around? If desperate…” Her voice softened unexpectedly, “You should’ve come to me first.”

Guan Yu’s jaw dropped. Before he processed this, Feng Xin scooped him up bridal-style, ignoring his protests. Noticing his conspicuous bulge, she flushed but snorted: “Lecher.”

As she carried him toward the bathroom, Guan Yu realized with dread—this was karmic retribution for previously carrying her in similar circumstances.

**Chapter 377: So Dark**

The absurd scene—a grown man cradled by a beauty—would’ve suggested passionate intentions to any observer. For Guan Yu, the humiliation burned, though Feng Xin’s floral scent and accidental breast brushes offered slight consolation.

Inside the bathroom, Feng Xin lingered. “Well? Pee already!”

“I… can’t with you watching.”

“Fine!” She stormed out.

Struggling with his zipper, Guan Yu despaired—until spotting a power outlet. A metal wire became his salvation. As electricity surged through him, his dormant system reactivated, energy flooding his veins.

When Feng Xin peeked in moments later, she found him grinning—fully revived, pants magically fastened.
