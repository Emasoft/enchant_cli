“He loves money—Magistrate Pang could be called the most money-loving of all. The kind who’s extremely stingy despite his immense wealth, unwilling to spend, hoarding banknotes day after day. To part with so much now is more agonizing than death itself.”

“But at this critical juncture, Magistrate Pang finally saw the light: life matters far more than money. If one loses their life, all the wealth in the world becomes useless.”

“Wang Jun couldn’t care less. Since they offered it, refusing would be foolish. The sum was staggering. Unable to return it, he stuffed the banknotes into his robe without hesitation.”

“Seeing Wang Jun accept the bribe, Magistrate Pang relaxed. If money could resolve this, it was no problem at all.”

“You mentioned Young Master Jiang is here in my yamen. Is that true?”

“Of course. Why would I lie? We’ve uncovered everything between you and Young Master Li. Captain Yu’s men are here to dismantle your operation,” Wang Jun stated bluntly.

Magistrate Pang trembled. “You’re my ancestor, alright? We all need to survive. Can’t you spare us this once?”

“I don’t care. You gave me silver—money moves ghosts. But Young Master Jiang’s thoughts? Who knows?” Wang Jun sneered. “You’re unlucky to cross us. You and Young Master Li murdered Liu Yun’s husband and eldest daughter. My master won’t let this slide.”

“This...this is a misunderstanding!” Magistrate Pang pleaded. “Had I known Liu Yun’s ties to Young Master Jiang, I’d never have touched her family!”

“Magistrate Pang, shouldn’t you fetch us some water?” Captain Yu interjected.

The others rested in the courtyard while Magistrate Pang clung to Wang Jun, hoping his bribe might yet save him.

With Wang Jun bribed, Magistrate Pang sought to stall Captain Yu, buying time for Young Master Li to gather more silver. Lies wouldn’t suffice—only money could mend this.

“Captain Yu, rest assured. I’ll remain here. If you find evidence of my crimes, I’ll surrender willingly.”

“Stay quiet,” Captain Yu ordered. Magistrate Pang whispered to a soldier, who hurried off.

From his sleeve, he produced more banknotes, sidling up to Captain Yu. “A token of respect. Please don’t judge harshly.”

“Magistrate Pang, your integrity is unquestionable,” Captain Yu grinned, pocketing the bribe.

They’d all sold out—even the Prefectural Governor could be bought.

“Take your time resting,” Captain Yu said, granting Magistrate Pang an opening.

Seizing the chance, Magistrate Pang bolted. “Young Master Li! Move the women now! We’ve been exposed!”

Young Master Li panicked. Slave trafficking meant execution—or worse. “Who’s here? You said to prepare silver!”

“Silver’s needed, but we must evacuate the women. Inspectors are coming!”

As they argued, Guanyu appeared. “Leaving? Too late.”

“Who are you?” Magistrate Pang spun around, paling. “Young Master Jiang? When did you arrive?”

“Last night. I watched your every move. Now, imagine your punishment.”

Magistrate Pang signaled Young Master Li to fetch more silver.

“Young Master Jiang, accept this humble gift.”

Guanyu scoffed. “Your sins are too grave. Surrender now. The Li family will pay for your crimes.”

Magistrate Panic revealed Wang Jun’s bribe. Guanyu frowned. “I’m no Young Master Jiang. I seek justice. Confess now, or we’ll expose your dungeon.”

“Impostor! What’s your aim?”

“To end you.”

Young Master Li lunged with a dagger. Guanyu disarmed him, snapping his arm.

“Evidence? I’ll show you!”

Dragging Young Master Li to Captain Yu, Guanyu declared, “They traffic slaves. Arrest Magistrate Pang!”

“Are you Guanyu?”

“Yes. Follow me.”

Young Master Li thrashed. “Release me! My family will ruin you!”

Ignoring him, Captain Yu wavered, torn by bribes.

Guanyu snapped, “Delay further, and I’ll report your incompetence to the Prefect!”

Reluctantly, Captain Yu complied.

“Chapter 3910: Wealthy Scion”

At the dungeon, women wept. Young Master Li’s arrogance crumbled as evidence mounted.

Guanyu glared. “Your wealth won’t save you now.”

The Li family’s fall began.
