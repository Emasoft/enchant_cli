As Locke’s voice faded, a thunderous thud echoed as a colossal figure landed before him and Guan Yu. Locke froze, utterly bewildered—what had just transpired in the air?

Fortunately, the Primeval Beast was only gravely injured, not yet dead. Perched lazily atop its head was a small cat stretching its limbs before licking its lips, a bloodied eye clamped between its teeth!

**Chapter 1349: The Death of the Primeval Beast**

The scene left the crowd astounded. No one had imagined that the seemingly unremarkable stray cat possessed such fearsome power. The Primeval Beast was an Earth-rank magical beast, yet Bika Cat had effortlessly crippled it—proof that Bika’s strength far surpassed Earth-rank, possibly even higher!

Locke trembled, his voice quaking as he stared at Bika Cat. “What…what kind of monster *is* this? How can it be so powerful?”

Guan Yu sneered. “What’s wrong? Weren’t you brimming with confidence in your beast earlier? Now you’re wilting?”

“Hmph! Don’t get cocky, brat! Losing an eye hasn’t sapped the Primeval Beast’s combat power! The battle’s far from decided!”

Guan Yu scoffed. “Truly, you refuse to yield until all hope is lost. Very well—I’ll teach you the folly of arrogance!”

Locke barked a laugh. “*Me*, defeated? Dream on! What you’ve seen so far is but a tenth of my true power. Even if all of you combined your strength, you’d still fall before me!”

The declaration stunned the crowd. Murmurs rippled: “Is he mad? What delusion fuels such boasts? A mere Magus, even a prodigy, claiming he can overpower everyone?”

Yet Patriarch Allen, leader of the elven clan, harbored different thoughts. Having watched Locke grow, he knew the young elf’s brilliance in magic was unparalleled. By elven standards, Locke’s 130 years equated to a human’s thirteen—yet he’d already reached Advanced Mage status, a once-in-a-century talent.

More troubling were the rumors of Locke’s disappearance years prior. While he claimed to have been lost in the forest, none believed it—elves don’t vanish in their own home. Whispers hinted he’d journeyed to Nanjiang, the perilous southern frontier of Bluemist Continent, a land teeming with mysterious beasts and forbidden arts. Allen suspected Locke’s inexplicable abilities stemmed from that accursed place.

On the arena, Locke seethed with humiliation. Bika Cat’s maiming of his Primeval Beast marked his second public defeat—an unbearable blow to his pride. Desperate to reclaim dignity, he prodded the wounded beast: “Can you endure this disgrace?”

The Primeval Beast shook its head weakly, pain evident in its remaining eye. Locke coldly exploited its anguish, urging a final sacrifice.

Bika Cat glared disdainfully at Locke. Once resentful of the Primeval Beast, it now recognized the creature as another victim of Locke’s manipulation.

As tension mounted, the Primeval Beast suddenly lunged at Guan Yu. Bika Cat sprang onto its head, then swiftly scaled its neck. The beast thrashed, attempting flight, but Guan Yu conjured a violet energy blade, shearing half its wing. Simultaneously, Bika Cat sank fangs into its neck—blood sprayed as the crowd recoiled in horror.

Gasps erupted. “That cat’s ferocity exceeds all expectations!”

“Where did that dragonkin find such a vicious familiar? It’s a wolf in kitten’s fur!”

Even Allen and his allies stared in awe. Guan Yu’s secret weapon had shifted the tide—hope flickered where doubt once reigned.

“Bika Cat’s amazing! I never knew it was so powerful, haha!” clapped Amy, her laughter ringing bright.

“Bika Cat? That’s its name?” Allen asked.

“Of course! It’s no ordinary cat—it can even speak!”

“*What?*”

The revelation sent shockwaves. While high-tier magical beasts were known, none could speak—this defied all Bluemist Continent’s records!

Meanwhile, the Primeval Beast collapsed with a final whimper. Bika Cat had granted a swift end, sparing further suffering. But for Locke, no such mercy would come.

Witnessing his familiar’s demise, Locke paled. Now truly grasping Guan Yu’s threat, he drew a sinister sword swirling with dark energy.

“What weapon is that? Its aura reeks of malice!”

**Chapter 1350: Absolute Trust**

“The Demonic Profound Black Sword!” Bika Cat whispered into Guan Yu’s ear.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. He’d faced the Profound Black Sword before against Wei Buqun—this “demonic” variant promised greater peril.

“Guan Yu,” Locke jeered, “consider this a courtesy: flee now, and I’ll forget your insolence. Persist, and this blade ends you.”

Guan Yu glanced at Allen, whose conflicted expression mirrored the stakes. Losing the patriarch’s position meant annihilation for his faction—and likely the elves’ enslavement to human wars under Locke’s rule.

“Damn it!” growled Shi Tuo, Allen’s ally. “If Guan Yu wavers, we’re finished!”

Yet Allen remained silent, refusing to pressure his unlikely ally.

“Don’t listen, Guan Yu!” Shi Tuo bellowed. “This snake’s trying to trick you!”

Locke smirked. “See how they panic? They *use* you! Once we’re both weakened, they’ll discard you—an outsider gains nothing here.”

Amy stomped forward. “I bet Brother Guan Yu won’t betray us!”

“Child,” sighed Shi Tuo, “you don’t understand—fear twists loyalties.”

“I believe in him,” interjected Roxy, emerging from the crowd. Her steadfast gaze alongside Amy’s resolve softened Shi Tuo’s doubt.

Onstage, Guan Yu feigned contemplation before grinning. “Thanks for the advice—I’ll keep it in mind.”

Locke brightened. “Then you’ll stand down?”

“Stand down? Why would I?”

The crowd erupted as Locke’s face purpled. “You mock me?!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Enough chatter. The audience came for a show—let’s give them one!”

Laughter swept the arena. Amy beamed. “See? He’d never abandon us!”

Relieved, Allen exhaled. With Guan Yu and Bika Cat, victory seemed possible—if the youth’s motives held true.

Locke raised his cursed blade. “Since you crave death, taste my Demonic Profound Black Sword!”

Guan Yu smirked, summoning an identical sword from his spatial ring.

“How?!” Locke gaped. “You possess a Profound Black Sword?!”

“Why not?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Your ‘precious’ blade’s as common as dirt.”

The crowd stared—such swords were rare Earth-rank treasures, coveted yet prohibitively costly.

**Chapter 1351: Demonic Profound Black Sword**

Locke’s rage crested. “Enough games! DIE!”

As he charged, Guan Yu’s three supporters cheered—Amy, Roxy, and the enigmatic Shao Siming, his “goddess” observer.

“For my ladies,” Guan Yu grinned, parrying Locke’s strike, “I’ll crush you thoroughly!”

The clash of demonic blades lit the arena, a storm of dark energy and resolve—the battle for the elves’ fate raged on.
