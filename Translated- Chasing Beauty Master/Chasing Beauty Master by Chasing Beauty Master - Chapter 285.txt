“Hmph, five might be accurate, but that’s only for now. Who knows if more people will move in later? It’s always better to prepare more—better safe than sorry!” Liu Shilei wrinkled her nose, speaking with a hint of jealousy.

“Uh…” Guan Yu blinked, clearly not expecting Liu Shilei to think so far ahead or to be so magnanimous as to allow more women to move in. Her answer left him somewhat ashamed, and his gaze toward her grew even tenderer.

“Boss Guan, Madam, I’ll relay your suggestions to the higher-ups. We’ll try to add more rooms while maintaining the layout. Would you like to stay here longer for a tour?” Manager Wang said.

“Hmm, you can go attend to your work. Shilei and I will stay here a while longer,” Guan Yu nodded.

Manager Wang left the villa.

“Darling, we don’t need to go through all that trouble. If the rooms aren’t enough, we can just take another villa next to this one. Two villas side by side won’t cause any issues,” Guan Yu said with a mischievous grin.

Liu Shilei rolled her eyes. “You think villas are free? You can’t just take them as you please.”

“They *are* free,” Guan Yu shrugged casually.

“What? What did you say?” Liu Shilei asked, puzzled.

“I said we don’t have to pay for the villas here. Not just one—you can have as many as you want. Just tell Manager Wang, and he’ll handle it,” Guan Yu grinned.

Liu Shilei stared at him in disbelief. “You’re acting like some tycoon. Do you think these villas are all yours? You can just take whichever you want?”

Guan Yu smirked. “You’re right. I *am* the tycoon you’re talking about. These villas are all mine. In other words, you’re the boss’s wife.”

Liu Shilei covered her mouth, staring at Guan Yu in shock.

**Chapter 721: If Not Dead from Exhaustion, Then Dead from Running**

Perspective shapes thought. One’s position determines how they see the world.

Liu Shilei was just an ordinary teacher at an art college, her understanding of the outside world limited by her life experiences. She knew Guan Yu wasn’t just a student but also a gang leader. She once believed the underworld was all violence and chaos, but Guan Yu had corrected that view. However, she still assumed gangsters were either extravagantly wealthy or dirt poor. Now, Guan Yu shattered that perception.

“Guan Yu… you… how?” Liu Shilei stammered, struggling to process this revelation.

Guan Yu smiled, gently brushing a strand of hair from her face. “I only found out last night that I own this place. As the boss, you’re the mistress here. You can do whatever you want with these villas—keep them all if you like.”

Liu Shilei sighed. “If we keep them all, how will you make money?”

Guan Yu grinned. “It’s no big deal. Don’t underestimate your husband. I’m the most powerful person in N City right now.”

“You’re impossible,” Liu Shilei said, poking his forehead.

Outside the villa, they encountered Liu Fuqiang, who’d been waiting. Guan宇 coldly brushed past him, but Liu Fuqiang tried to speak. Before he could finish, Guan Yu kicked him to the ground.

**Chapter 722: New Semester, New Atmosphere**

Winter faded, spring arrived, and Guan Yu entered his second semester of university. Though he’d spent little time on campus, he cherished the memories here—where he’d gained the copper coin that changed his life, became a man, and built his empire.

The new semester buzzed with energy. Students flooded nearby restaurants, one in particular drawing crowds due to its “special” table: two campus beauties flanking a man, with three other stunning girls. The sight attracted gawkers and gossipers.

“To Brother Yu and the ladies!” Tian Hao, the restaurant owner’s son, raised his glass.

The table erupted in laughter and banter as drinks flowed. Tian Hao, pressured by friends, downed three cups in quick succession. His girlfriend, Hu Yuhan, intervened, but the revelry continued.

By the end, Wang Zhen and Niu Le lay under the table, too drunk to move, leaving their girlfriends exasperated. The night ended with Guan宇 escorting Zhao Jing’er and Du Xiaojuan home, while the others stumbled behind.

**Chapter 723: Airport Pickup**

Most deals are sealed over drinks—it’s a social lubricant. But it’s also a catalyst for camaraderie. After a raucous feast, Guan宇 left with Zhao Jing’er and Du Xiaojuan, while Wang Zhen and the others lay passed out, their girlfriends left to manage the aftermath.
