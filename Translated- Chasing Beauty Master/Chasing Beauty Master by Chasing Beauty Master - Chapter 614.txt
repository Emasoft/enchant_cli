“I said, don’t order me around!” Guan Yu laughed, yet her tone carried an irrefutable authority. Wu Yuying, standing nearby, suddenly seemed to realize something and shouted, “Hey! If you’re so capable, join the trial! Let’s settle this once and for all!” True, killing was forbidden here, but in the Demon Trials—there would be no holding back!

“Exactly! Prove your courage in the trial!” the demonic man chimed in, seeing Wu Yuying’s provocation. If Guan Yu entered, her death would be certain! The surrounding demons murmured in awe—this was a battle to the death, where defeat meant annihilation!

Guan Yu’s interest ignited. *Demon Trials?* She’d test her limits! Nothing stoked one’s fighting spirit like life-or-death combat!

Noticing Guan Yu’s silence, Wu Yuying smirked disdainfully. “What? Scared now?” Guan Yu countered, “If even *auntie* here dares join, why wouldn’t I?”

“You—!” Wu Yuying choked, too furious to retort. In truth, she *was* afraid—she had no intention of risking her life.

Turning with exaggerated grace, Wu Yuying sauntered to the demon man and threw herself into his arms. “Dia~” she cooed, “You *must* avenge me!” Dia reveled in her embrace. “Don’t worry, Yuying! I’ll crush her!” He glared at Guan Yu, who taunted, “So the auntie’s too cowardly?!” The crowd erupted in scorn toward Wu Yuying, though their gazes toward Dia held reverence—this was a top-100 contender in the Demon Trials!

Guan Yu shot Wu Yuying a contemptuous glance. *Such a spineless fool will never rise to greatness.* Her true focus now was Dia—this man radiated danger. Coldly, she demanded, “Where?” Her playful demeanor vanished, replaced by the chilling aura of a true Asura. The demons instinctively parted as she strode to the registration desk.

The registrar eyed her dismissively. “Registration?”

“Yes.”

“Name?”

“Asura.”

“Age?”

“...”

The process concluded swiftly. Dia, watching nearby, drawled, “I’ll await you in the trial,” before leaving with Wu Yuying. As Guan Yu turned to depart, the registrar tossed her a card. “Wait! Your room number.” Catching it, she read: *Asura—Godslayer Residence! --3617+673061-->*

**Chapter 1558: Chimei**

“Free lodging with the trial? Convenient.”

“Return tomorrow for your first match,” the demon snapped. Guan Yu shrugged and left.

Following the directions, she soon stood before the Godslayer Residence. *Competitors are isolated here—good. Fewer nuisances.*

Inside, she summoned Chimei. “We’re staying here. Take a look.” The quarters surpassed her previous hovel and tree hollow. Chimei ignored the tour, flopping onto the bed. Guan Yu chuckled. *Rest while you can—tomorrow’s trial leaves no room for weakness.*

Dawn arrived. Guan Yu stored Chimei within the Soul-Devouring Whip, disguised as an ordinary belt. At the arena gates, her bloodlust surged. *This path drenched in blood—it’s mine to walk.* The doors creaked open to raucous jeers:

“A *human*?!”

“Can she even fight?”

“Tear her apart!”

Her first opponent brandished a golden greatsword. Enraged at facing a human, he swung furiously. Guan Yu sidestepped effortlessly. *Fast!* the demon thought, alarmed. His blade—forged from pure destructive gold—had missed!

Guan Yu tensed. *A gold-elementalist?* Chimei’s voice echoed in her mind: *Need help?*

“No. I’ve got this.”

Channeling gold energy into her fists, she struck—only to recoil from the impact. *His defense mirrors mine!* Experimenting, she fused wind with gold, using cyclonic force to amplify her strike. This time, her kick sent him sprawling. Seizing his dissolving blade, she ended him with his own weapon.

The crowd fell silent as green blood splattered her face. She licked her lips, smiling. A single shout broke the stillness: “ASURA!” The chant spread like wildfire.

From the shadows above, a red-clad figure smiled before vanishing. Over days, Guan Yu climbed the ranks, her “Asura” title spreading through the inner city.

**Chapter 1559: Fangs**

“Asura! Impressive progress—but it ends here!” Dia snarled. Guan Yu smirked. “Where’s your auntie? Speaking of endings—yours, perhaps?”

Enraged, Dia unleashed lightning. Guan Yu dodged, mentally signaling Chimei: *Your turn.*

The shadowy figure materialized, evading Dia’s strikes with preternatural speed. “Third parties are forbidden!” Dia protested.

“He’s my weapon’s spirit,” Guan Yu retorted. The crowd buzzed—a sentient artifact spirit!

As Dia’s energy waned, Chimei struck, felling him with extended fangs. Watching from the stands, Wu Yuying paled before plotting anew. *That Soul-Devouring Whip will be your downfall.*

That night, demons swarmed Godslayer Residence. Guan Yu and Chimei repelled them, but the subsequent calm felt ominous. “Someone’s been tailing you,” Chimei warned. “Powerful, but non-hostile.”

Meanwhile, Wu Yuying knelt before the crimson-robed city lord, divulging Guan Yu’s secrets. Unimpressed, he ordered her execution. By dawn, Wu Yuying’s corpse littered the streets—blamed on Guan Yu, cementing her fearsome reputation.

**Chapter 1560: An Equitable Deal**

Guan Yu awoke on silken sheets in an unfamiliar chamber. A masked red-clad man sat nearby. “Awake?”

“Who are you?” She tensed.

“No hostility intended. I propose… a transaction.”

“What terms?”

“Pass the trials, and I’ll explain.”

He materialized before her, brushing hair from her face. “I’m Hong Feng, city lord. You’ll serve my purpose.”

Guan Yu met his gaze evenly. “What do you want?”

“Merely your cooperation. Succeed, and we’ll discuss… *equitably*.”
