At this moment, Guan Yu's true strength was fully revealed. The Three Sword Divine Abilities – this simplified version of the Seven Star Sword Array originally designed for the Nascent Soul stage – demanded not just cultivation base, but profound comprehension of swordsmanship and application of divine abilities. Even with utmost effort, Guan Yu could only manifest three divine abilities, still far from the Nascent Soul realm's Seven Stars Convergence or the Nascent Spirit realm's Star Array Formation.

Yet these three divine abilities remained formidable. Unfortunately, Guan Yu's opponent was at the Nascent Soul stage.

"Heh! With these three divine abilities, you'd stand tall among Golden Core juniors. Pity... BREAK!" A crimson flash illuminated the massive saber gleam that sliced through the air.

CLANG!!!

The clear metallic resonance reverberated like temple bells, startling both the demonic sect members battling magical beasts a li away and the three veteran combatants in stalemate.

As their spiritual energies collided, Guan Yu felt his blood freeze. His magic sword went flying with a shrill clang, his body hurled backward as if hit by a truck. More terrifyingly, the bloody palm imprint continued its relentless advance.

"Die!" Compared to Guan Yu's disheveled state, Blood Wuyang merely staggered slightly, suppressing the burning sensation in his spiritual energy within moments.

BOOM!

Lightning flashed as Guan Yu used the recoil momentum to somersault through air, covering two li in mere instants. Yet the bloody palm imprint pursued relentlessly. Spitting out congealed blood, Guan Yu summoned his violet magic sword back – dragon-shaped energy coiling around his left arm while his right gripped the sword hilt.

"Divine Abilities – Vermilion Bird Fire Rain! Soaring Dragon Quadrants!"

ROAR!!!

A golden dragon materialized midair, clashing violently with the bloody palm imprint. The continuous explosions of colliding energies gradually dissipated both the dragon and weakened the bloody handprint. A crimson phoenix then soared skyward with sizzling flames, completely dissolving the remaining bloody imprint before diving ferociously at Blood Wuyang.

CRASH!

Blood Wuyang was sent flying, skidding back seven-eight steps upon landing. His singed hair and robes testified to the attack's potency – no major injuries, but undeniable humiliation.

For a Nascent Soul expert, being forced into such straits by a mid-Golden Core cultivator was intolerable.

"Impossible! How could your spiritual energy be so profound? Even with Nascent Soul-level techniques, mere years of cultivation couldn't achieve this! No cultivation instability either... You're a freak of nature!" Blood Wuyang's shock was understandable – Guan Yu had unleashed five divine abilities consecutively with negligible recovery intervals.

The Nascent Soul expert himself grew exhausted after two divine abilities. Yet Guan Yu, merely pale-faced, had executed five.

"The profundity of my cultivation surpasses your comprehension. Shall we continue?" Though outwardly composed, Guan Yu's meridians were depleted – even a Foundation Establishment cultivator could kill him now. Yet his earlier ferocity had shaken Blood Wuyang, whose energy was also dwindling.

"Humph! I'll spare you this time, brat. Next meeting spells your doom!" As Blood Wuyang attempted to flee via blood shadow teleportation, he found himself immobilized like the Monkey King under Five Finger Mountain, crimson light flickering uselessly around him.

"Youngster, how does being bullied by your senior feel? Now experience the reverse." A blue-clad figure approached with deceptive slowness – Whale Three had intervened.

The chasm between Tribulation Passage and Nascent Soul stages needed no explanation. As Whale Three appeared, Guan Yu collapsed, gasping for breath. Five consecutive divine abilities had pushed him beyond limits – only the Great Demon Subduing Scripture's ability to convert demonic energy and his frantic consumption of spirit stones and recovery pills had sustained him this long.

"Elder... may I inquire..." Sensing the vast cultivation gap, Blood Wuyang abandoned resistance. Noting the overwhelming demonic aura, he guessed this might be a native demonic beast.

"I am Whale Three, Guardian Beast of the Demon Subduing Sect. Tell your superiors: while we welcome conflict, violate mortal realm conventions again, and rivers of blood will flow when our sect comes calling. These are Elder Qin Wuliang's exact words. Remember them. Now SCRAM!" With a flick of Whale Three's finger, the Nascent Soul expert went flying toward his demonic sect comrades.

Regaining some strength, Guan Yu swallowed a five-colored pill from his spatial ring. As he meditated, the familiar agony of reforged muscles returned – the Five Elements Body Tempering Pill crafted by Qin Wuliang from magical beast essence and marrow. While enhancing muscles and tendons, its excruciating side effects remained.

Chapter 1213: Before the Medicinal Garden – Golden Core Demonic Beasts

The Nine Revolutions Mystic Art thrived in combat. Though exhausted, this battle proved beneficial for Guan Yu's breakthroughs.

After another quarter hour, Guan Yu rose pale-faced but radiating formidable aura. A experimental punch through air created sonic pressure – the resultant force blasted a crater into a tree two meters away.

"My fist speed surpasses sound! At least ten-ox strength." Guan Yu murmured, eyes flashing with triumph. Ten tons of force per fist – his arm strength had reached terrifying levels.

"Ten-ox strength marks your Nine Revolutions Mystic Art's initial mastery – first revolution of Foundation Establishment's nine cycles." Qin Wuliang appeared, analyzing: "Continue Five Elements Pills with intervals, but combat remains crucial for tempering. While your Seven Stars and Vermilion Bird sword techniques show promise, focus on improving fist and staff techniques."

"Must I truly practice staff techniques?" Guan Yu hesitated, wary of spreading talents too thin.

"While our sect doesn't mandate specific weapons, the basic Demon Subduing Staff Art is essential. The reasons... will become clear. Do you truly dislike staff techniques? We have time now that the demonic sect retreated. Let's proceed to our original objective." Qin Wuliang's eyes glinted – Guan Yu was no puppet, after all.

In following days, Guan Yu traded two demonic Golden Cores for the sect's foundational Demon Subduing Vajra Fist. Merging Buddhist fist techniques with his Great Demon Subduing Energy proved challenging.

Three days later, an enormous glowing formation came into view – its radiance visible even at night. Beyond sensing the formation's perfection, Guan Yu detected three demonic beast auras.

"Such formations have entry points." Qin Wuliang gestured toward the three beasts' location with an odd smile. "Three Golden Core peak demonic beasts. Can you manage?"

"Honestly uncertain. But worth attempting. If you defeat them, that special ability of yours..." Qin Wuliang trailed off meaningfully.

Taming Golden Core beasts was no simple matter. While magical beasts below Golden Core were easily subdued, those achieving Golden Core gained innate divine abilities and intelligence – often surpassing human cultivators in combat prowess.

"Hah! Taking three is impossible now. But one-on-one... I'll restrain the others." Qin Wuliang laughed heartily, pleased by Guan Yu's measured courage.

"Let's proceed then. Single combat..." Guan Yu's eyes burned with fighting spirit.

Chapter 1214: Solo Against the White Tiger

ROAR!!!

The triple bestial roar coalesced into terrifying pressure surpassing even Blood Wuyang's Nascent Soul aura. Were Golden Core demonic beasts truly this fearsome?

"Seems our hospitality isn't reciprocated. Whale Three – demonstrate proper etiquette." The blue-clad guardian appeared transformed – his previously volcanic aura now perfectly contained.

SNORT!

Whale Three's mere exhalation crushed the beasts' pressure instantly.

"Demon elder, we'll never ally with humans! Oppress us and we'll fight to the death!" The mental transmission came clear – surprisingly principled for demonic beasts.

"Such resolve? First behold this." Whale Three's aura shifted, triggering instinctive submission through bloodline resonance.

"Bloodline... evolution?! You've embarked on the Divine Beast path?!" The Earthburst Bear trembled, comical awe spreading across ursine features.

The leader, Howling Sun Skywolf, stammered in shock: "This era... how?!"

Divine Beast ascension – the ultimate aspiration for magical beasts. Though lengthy, this path offered inherited memories, bloodline suppression, divine abilities – everything for transcendent growth.

"We demand no immediate answers. Our sect master challenges you to single combat. Submit to the strong – our demonic tradition." Whale Three offered face-saving compromise.

After conferring, the Skywolf proposed: "If your sect master proves worthy... but must we follow him now?"

"You misunderstand. The challenge is immediate." Guan Yu interjected calmly, fully recovered through Nine Revolutions Art's miraculous healing – veritably the prime body tempering technique of antiquity.
