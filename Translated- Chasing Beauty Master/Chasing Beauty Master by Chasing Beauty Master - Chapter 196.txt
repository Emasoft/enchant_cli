“679321,” Guan Yu said.

“Dammit, this kid’s lying to us!” The young man input the code, but it was entirely incorrect.

“Lao Si, you didn’t kill that girl earlier, did you? Aim properly this time. Make sure a single bullet blows his head off,” the leader spoke coldly.

“674526!” Guan Yu hastily corrected himself. He realized this leader had pinpointed his weakness, leaving him no time to stall and wait for the police.

“Boss! Fifty million in the bag! Haha! Today’s haul was worth it!” The young man laughed maniacally.

Before his laughter could fade, a booming loudspeaker echoed from outside: “Criminals inside! You are surrounded! Surrender your weapons immediately!”

“Shit! Boss, how’d the cops get here so fast?!” The young man grabbed his weapon, furious.

“You did this?!” The leader glared at Guan Yu, yanking a military-grade phone from his pocket. The screen displayed “11.”

“Fuck! I’ll blow your brains out!” the young man roared.

But the leader stopped him, grinning sinisterly. “Lao Si, bring out those ‘treasures’ you collected. A bullet is too merciful for him.”

The young man paused, then smirked cruelly. “How could I forget those lovely toys?”

**Chapter 485: Feast of Beasts**

Cold sweat drenched Guan Yu’s back. Death had never felt so close. Had the leader hesitated even a second longer, his skull would’ve been splattered across the floor.

He exhaled heavily.

His eyes locked onto the young man approaching with a squirming black cloth bag. An ominous premonition gripped Guan Yu’s heart. Sitting idle meant certain death—he had to act.

Assessing the scene: Aside from the leader and the young man, the other robbers were frantically stuffing jewels into bags, including the thin man enduring his shattered groin. A cold pistol pressed against Guan Yu’s temple; the leader’s icy gaze warned against any movement.

His mind raced for solutions, but every path seemed blocked. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

“Do you really think you’ll escape?” Guan Yu stalled, praying the police would breach the building and create an opening.

“Why not?” The leader smirked, indulging him. “You’re buying time, waiting for SWAT to storm in so you can counterattack. Am I wrong?”

Guan Yu’s heart sank.

“Seems I’m right. But do you think I’d allow that?” The leader shoved the gun harder against his skull. Guan Yu’s breath hitched.

“Relax. I won’t shoot you yet. Where’s the fun in that? I savor the despair in dying eyes,” the leader chuckled, unhinged.

“Psychopath,” Guan Yu spat.

“You’re neither the first nor last to say that. Chat time’s over.” The leader turned to his crew. “Leave what you can’t carry. Cops’ll lose patience soon. Prep to move out.”

The five jewel collectors halted, hoisting bulging bags as they lined up behind the leader, staring indifferently at the cowering hostages.

“Ladies and gentlemen, as thanks for your cooperation, we’ll leave you a parting gift. Enjoy.” The leader nodded to the young man. “Lao Si, unleash your pets.”

Grinning wildly, the young man hefted the bag. “These little darlings took me ages to collect. Don’t waste them!”

He hurled the bag into the air. It arced over the crowd before bursting open mid-flight, unleashing a dark cascade of writhing creatures onto the hostages.

“Snakes! Venomous snakes!”

The first victim was the wealthy woman from earlier. A green bamboo viper coiled around her arms. She flailed instinctively, but the snake struck faster, fangs sinking into her flesh. She paled to a corpse-like hue before collapsing.

Chaos erupted as scorpions, centipedes, and lizards joined the snakes. Screams filled the air as people collapsed from venomous bites.

Mo Ling and Liu Shilei weren’t spared. Five scorpions skittered over Mo Ling’s trembling form. Liu Shilei fared worse—multiple vipers slithered around her legs, scorpions climbed her torso, and a lizard crept toward her face, its tongue flicking. Her face drained of color, frozen in terror.

“Hahaha! Feast well!” The young man howled with laughter.

“Stay put,” the leader hissed at Guan Yu, gun unwavering. “Watch your woman die slowly. Agonizing, isn’t it?”

“You’re monsters,” Guan Yu said flatly.

Beneath his calm exterior, Guan Yu summoned every ounce of energy. The ancient coin in his mind blazed—the **Pet System** activated. Threads of connection snapped into place with every creature in the room.

The moment he’d seen the bag, he’d known: this was his chance. Now, half the creatures were under his control. He closed his eyes, expanding his reach.

Ten seconds later, he reopened them, a faint smile playing on his lips.

**Chapter 486: Heaven’s Retribution**

The leader frowned. Where was the expected despair? “Impressive composure. Watching your lover get devoured and still calm? So much for ‘through thick and thin.’”

Guan Yu met his gaze. “Evil begets evil. Heaven’s justice always comes.”

The leader barked a laugh. “I’ll wait for that ‘heaven.’ For now, choose: crawl into the swarm, or have me break your legs and toss you in?”

Guan Yu’s smile sharpened. “Look at your right hand.”

The leader glanced down—a scorpion perched on his sleeve, tail poised to strike. His composure cracked. “Lao Si! Get rid of it!”

The young man froze. They’d taken antidotes—why were the creatures attacking? Panicking, he reached for a pouch of repellent powder... only to find scorpions swarming up his legs.

“Boss! Something’s wrong!” He stripped layers of pants, but the scorpions persisted. In desperation, he clawed at his underwear, flinging scorpions from his groin—

“AAARGH!”

He collapsed, writhing as the swarm engulfed him. Within seconds, his body turned purple-black. Foam bubbled from his lips as he died, eyes wide with horror.

The room fell deathly silent.

Trembling, the leader scanned his crew—each now covered in venomous creatures. Only Guan Yu stood untouched.

“How…?” The leader’s question died as the scorpion on his hand struck.

Guan Yu moved—gravity system flaring. He twisted the gun free and kicked the leader into the swarm. With a mental command, every creature converged on the robbers.

Screams erupted, then ceased. Six corpses lay twitching, skin mottled with toxins.

**Chapter 487: The Star Returns**

Guan Yu watched dispassionately. *Serves them right.*

He tossed the gun aside and approached the leader, now buried under scorpions save his face. “Heaven’s here for you.”

The leader’s eyes widened with realization—too late. The swarm consumed him.

“Jie, are you hurt?” Guan Yu knelt beside Liu Shilei.

She shook her head, gaze fixed on the lingering creatures. “I’m fine. But others need help. Call the police in.”
