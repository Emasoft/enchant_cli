A faint blush tinged Feng Xin’s cheeks as she explained involuntarily, “I merely wished to confirm the timing to prepare properly. We mustn’t neglect hospitality and let Uncle Guan look down on us.”

Her effortless use of “Uncle Guan” didn’t escape Guan Yu’s notice, though he maintained an earnest smile. “I’m unsure myself—it depends on Father’s arrangements. With New Year approaching, I’ll discuss it with him when I return.”

Feng Xin studied his calm expression, but Guan Yu’s resolve held firm, revealing no trace of unease.

After a prolonged silence, she huffed softly, abandoning the topic. Knowing Guan Yu well, she recognized when evasion signaled futility in pursuing answers.

Shifting tactics, she asked, “Do you need my help with today’s operation?”

Guan Yu shook his head. “I want to gauge the true strength of my current forces.”

Having delegated full authority to Luo Cheng for autonomous development, the time had come to assess their progress.

Understanding his intent, Feng Xin fell silent.

Driving to his headquarters, Guan Yu issued orders to Luo Cheng. To his surprise, Luo Cheng mobilized personnel with military precision. Within two hours, four squads stood assembled.

Though termed “squads,” each comprised 100 operatives armed with 15 submachine guns and top-tier equipment—veritable miniature armies. Guan Yu marveled at the sight.

His initial intent to evaluate Luo Cheng’s six-month progress proved unnecessary. The sheer might of his forces surpassed expectations—four elite combat units cultivated in half a year defied belief.

Naturally, 400 men couldn’t crowd into a single bar. Before Guan Yu stood their commanders—the Luo brothers.

As each detailed their expanded territories, Guan Yu nodded approvingly. Turning to Feng Xin with a boastful grin, he asked, “Isn’t deploying this strength against them excessive?”

Feng Xin absorbed his smug expression before retorting, “Utterly disproportionate. But why preen? These aren’t your achievements—Luo Cheng deserves the credit.”

Unfazed, Guan Yu puffed his chest.

Feng Xin rolled her eyes at his shamelessness.

Luo Cheng scratched his head awkwardly under her praise. “The credit isn’t mine. Without Brother Yu’s trust, substantial support, and Sister Xin’s assistance, none of this would exist.”

Guan Yu chuckled while Feng Xin ignored his self-satisfaction.

“Everything’s ready, Brother Yu,” Luo Cheng reported. “Your orders?”

In high spirits, Guan Yu waved grandly. “Command is yours. Proceed as you see fit.”

Luo Cheng hesitated. “But Brother Yu, this isn’t proper...”

Guan Yu raised a hand solemnly. “I understand your reservations, but I trust you completely. You’re my brother.”

He addressed Luo Cheng’s unspoken fear—that seizing initiative might breed suspicion.

The hardened man’s eyes glistened as he vowed hoarsely, “Give me two days, Brother Yu. Those four factions will vanish from N City.”

Guan Yu clapped his shoulder. “I have faith.”

As Luo Cheng departed with troops to purge the targeted groups—two linked to Wan Qianshan, two collateral casualties—the bar emptied save for Guan Yu and Feng Xin.

Pouring herself a drink, Feng Xin mused aloud, “In this underworld, vigilance is wise.”

Guan Yu smiled cryptically. “I truly consider him family.”

Feng Xin studied his profile, silent and pensive.

**Chapter 555: Troubles Everywhere**

Dawn’s third day brought surface calm to N City while its underworld convulsed. Luo Cheng’s thunderous campaign erased four factions with brutal efficiency.

Though power shifts were routine, this upheaval unsettled many.

Reviewing reports, Guan Yu murmured, “You’re next,” his lips curving slightly.

*The upright fear no shadows.*

But guilt breeds sensitivity.

In a private club, two men and a woman occupied triangular seating.

The first man towered at over 190cm, his face marred by twin scars, eyes radiating predatory menace—Yang Long, the dreaded God of Slaughter.

His counterpart possessed starkly contrasting traits—aquiline nose, square jaw, casual attire belying the cunning of Zhou Jin, infamous “Man-Trapper.”

The sole woman, Chu Hong, embodied lethal allure: oval face, phoenix eyes, willowy brows, and porcelain skin radiating sensual magnetism—a beauty rivaling Wen Qing, capable of driving men to ruin.

Feng Xin’s warning about Guan Yu’s inadequacy against her held merit.

N City’s elite knew Chu Hong as the社交 butterfly none could resist—a master seductress whose bedroom prowess overshadowed her notorious promiscuity. Men明知her toxicity yet plunged willingly into her web.

The legendary交际花Chu Hong.

That these three rivals convened secretly spoke volumes. Had word leaked, speculation would rage—but only the dead knew this location.

Chu Hong broke silence first, her melodious voice dripping with mockery. “Zhou Jin, why summon us? Our meeting’s sensitivity could spark delightful chaos if known.”

Zhou Jin’s gaze lingered on her décolletage before sobering. “Qian Tong’s plan failed.”

“Days-old news,” Chu Hong laughed, bosom quivering. “You risked exposure for this?”

“Chen Biao and Wang Dahu were purged too. Doesn’t this pattern concern you?” Zhou Jin’s epithet “Wisdom Prince” stemmed from acute perception.

Chu Hong shrugged. “Qian Tong failed because he’s inept. Guan Yu vented anger on four factions—Chen and Wang were unlucky scapegoats. The boy stumbled onto two connected targets.”

“That’s the underworld narrative,” Zhou Jin countered. “You believe it? I don’t.”

Sipping wine, Chu Hong reclined, accentuating curves. “Why doubt the obvious?”

“Typical breast-over-brains,” Zhou Jin sneered.

Chu Hong sat bolt upright, snarling, “Men crave these! You included! Need me to ease your frustration?”

Zhou Jin ignored the bait. “What if Qian Tong betrayed us? What if eliminating two factions was misdirection targeting us?”

Chu Hong paused, the possibility dawning. “He’d never dare—not with family hostages.”

Rubbing his temples, Zhou Jin sighed. “Hence this meeting. Advise.”

“This youth... is formidable,” he murmured.

Both tensed. Zhou Jin’s rare praise—reserved for N City’s top ten—demanded attention. The once-overlooked Guan Yu now threatened their dominion.

“Kill him,” Yang Long growled—his first words.

Zhou Jin shook his head. “You’d lose.”

Murderous chill permeated the room as Yang Long demanded, “Justify.”

“Could you breach four guards and two snipers undetected? Kill five in confined space? Disarm my specialized bomb?” Zhou Jin listed coldly. “I designed that device. Its neutralization proves his exceptional danger. Taiwan’s bigshot also suffered under him.”

Yang Long stiffened. Though a warrior reliant on Zhou Jin’s strategems, he admitted hoarsely, “I couldn’t.”

Chu Hong frowned. “We considered him a threat, yet underestimated him.”

“He must die,” Yang Long insisted.

Zhou Jin否决ed. “Failure risks exposing us, undoing years of work.”

“Then let him grow stronger?”

“Not you,” Zhou Jin smiled, eyeing Chu Hong. “But her.”

“Me?” Chu Hong gaped.

“His lust,” Zhou Jin clarified.

Comprehension dawned as she laughed throatily. “Let me try.”

Yang Long protested, “Send her to seduce him?”

Zhou Jin nodded. “Discreetly. He’s cunning.”

“I’ll have him begging for death beneath my skirts,” Chu Hong purred, adjusting her décolletage.

As she swayed out, Yang Long lingered. “This plan...”

Zhou Jin departed without answer, schemes unfolding.

**Chapter 556: Untitled**

Yang Long’s “God of Slaughter” title stemmed not just from combat prowess, but death-forged aura chilling bones. Proud and battle-hardened, Zhou Jin’s dismissal of his ability against a youth galled him.

Zhou Jin’s analysis bit deep: Could he replicate Guan Yu’s feats? Penetrate defenses? Neutralize experts? Disarm Zhou Jin’s bomb? Reluctantly, Yang Long conceded—this demanded respect.

Chu Hong’s brow furrowed. “We deemed him a latent threat, yet miscalculated.”

“He must die,” Yang Long reiterated.

Zhou Jin否决ed again. “Your failure risks us all.”

“Let him strengthen further?”

“Not you,” Zhou Jin nodded at Chu Hong. “Hers.”

The courtesan blinked. “Me?”

“His weakness is lust.”

Chu Hong’s laugh tinkled. “He’ll die craving me.”

Yang Long scowled. “This plan—”

Zhou Jin cut him off. “Our era demands more than brute force.”

As Chu Hong departed, hips swaying, Zhou Jin followed to orchestrate his gambit.
