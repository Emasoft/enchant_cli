Since Guan Yu was now an outsider, he couldn’t take Wang Xiaorong with him when leaving. If he did, the officials under Zhou Daren from the magistrate’s office would never allow it. However, Guan Yu alone could report the clues from Zhao County without issue. Thus, he had no choice but to leave Wang Xiaorong in the study.

Though he knew this was likely the murder method, Guan Yu couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Yet, he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what—there were still missing pieces.

After leaving, Yue Gao arrived at the adjacent room, which belonged to the old master, intending to search for clues.

The old master’s room was relatively tidy, maintained by Mrs. Wan. Though the old master loved fishing, all his fishing gear was stored in a dedicated area, periodically cleaned and organized by servants.

Yue Gao rummaged through the room but found nothing until he discovered a spool of fishing line in a drawer.

The line, made of silk, was exceptionally thin yet sturdy—ideal for fishing. A faint smile curled Yue Gao’s lips as he muttered, “I’ve found it at last.”

Returning to the main room, Yue Gao scanned the crowd before settling his gaze on the old master. “I shall now demonstrate how the killer orchestrated this locked-room murder,” he declared.

Zhou Daren interjected impatiently, “You already know the killer’s identity? Skip the theatrics and just name the culprit!”

“Zhou Daren, I am a man of principle,” Yue Gao replied sternly. “As a detective, I must reconstruct the crime through reasoning. Accusing someone requires evidence and motive. Otherwise, arresting a random person and forcing a confession through torture would render my presence here meaningless.”

Zhou Daren sighed. “Fine, proceed with your tedious methods. I’ll listen.”

Yue Gao nodded. “Your build closely resembles the deceased—both portly. I ask you to play the victim’s role to demonstrate the killer’s technique.”

Though reluctant, Zhou Daren agreed. “Very well. For the sake of solving this case, I’ll pretend to be a corpse. Begin.”

**Chapter 3666: Identifying the Killer**

Yue Gao was satisfied. Despite Zhou Daren’s occasional incompetence, he was fundamentally decent and took Master Wan’s murder seriously.

“Zhou Daren, does your sleeve have an inner pocket?” Yue Gao asked. Such pockets were common for storing small items like keys or loose coins.

“Yes. See here?” Zhou Daren rolled up his sleeve to show it.

“Good. Please sit in the deceased’s chair.” Yue Gao retrieved a needle from the old master’s drawer—the same one found with the fishing line.

“Observe the threshold,” Yue Gao instructed. “There are marks left by the fishing line, likely from the killer’s setup.”

Wan Guocai and Wang Xiaorong examined the threshold and confirmed two faint, fresh grooves.

“The killer used this line to deposit the key into Master Wan’s sleeve pocket,” Yue Gao explained. “First, they drugged his tea, poisoned him with a needle, then arranged him as if asleep. Threading the line through the needle, they guided it from the sleeve’s inner pocket to the door.

“After inserting the key into the lock—a type that automatically latches when the key is removed—the killer closed the door, yanked the line to pull the key free, locking the room. Another line then dragged the key back into the sleeve’s pocket.

“When we entered, Master Wan’s right hand propped his chin, while his left arm lay flat on the desk—matching Zhou Daren’s current posture. The key was thus returned to the left sleeve’s pocket, creating the illusion of a locked room.”

Yue Gao reenacted the method, successfully pulling the key back into Zhou Daren’s pocket.

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “How elaborate! The killer must be quite clever.”

“Enough!” Zhou Daren snapped. “Who is the killer?”

Yue Gao turned to the old master. “Only you had the time and expertise with fishing lines. You killed your own son, didn’t you?”

“Impossible!” Wan Guocai protested. “Grandfather would never—”

The old master sighed. “You’re correct. I murdered my son.” His voice, suddenly lucid, stunned everyone.

**Chapter 3667: Framing the Innocent**

“He’s not the killer,” Guan Yu interjected, striding into the room. “The old master feigned senility to avoid unpleasant truths, but he’s innocent.”

Yue Gao bristled. “He confessed! The fishing line in his room proves it!”

Guan Yu tossed multiple spools of identical line and needles onto the floor. “These were planted across the estate to frame him. A true culprit wouldn’t scatter evidence so carelessly.”

Yue Gao faltered. “But the key in the sleeve’s pocket…”

“Was buttoned shut,” Guan Yu countered. “Your demonstration ignored that. The line couldn’t reseal the button.”

Wang Xiaorong gasped. “He’s right! The pocket was closed when we found the key!”

Zhou Daren nodded. “The threshold marks were also part of the ruse.”

Guan Yu pointed at Mrs. Wan. “The study had two keys. Master Wan’s was ‘returned,’ but yours remains. You’re the killer.”

“Preposterous!” Mrs. Wan retorted calmly. “I was with you the entire time.”

Guan Yu tested Master Wan’s tea and the poison needle. “The narcotic and toxin only react lethally when combined. You drugged him, then used the needle. Your alibi is a lie.”

**Chapter 3668: Delirious Accusations**

Zhou Daren inspected the blackened silver needles. “The poison required the narcotic to activate. You planned this meticulously.”

Mrs. Wan’s composure wavered as Guan Yu unveiled her scheme—exploiting the old master’s fishing tools and feigned absence to commit the perfect crime.

“You underestimated the buttoned pocket,” Guan Yu concluded. “A small oversight, but fatal to your plan.”

Cornered, Mrs. Wan’s mask of innocence crumbled, revealing the cold calculation beneath. The truth, once shrouded in tangled lines, now lay bare.
