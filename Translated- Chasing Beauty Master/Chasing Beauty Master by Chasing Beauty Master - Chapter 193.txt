“I…” Under Guan Yu’s intense gaze, Shao Guobang felt incapable of hiding his innermost thoughts, cold sweat drenching his back.

This young man was terrifying, Shao concluded.

“No need to prevaricate,” Guan Yu stated bluntly. “You look down on Luo Cheng precisely because he’s an unknown street thug offering you no tangible benefits. Had he risen to Boss Liu’s stature in the underworld, you’d be applauding with both hands and feet – perhaps fawning over him more obsequiously than you do Liu Xing.”

Shao’s legs trembled as Guan Yu laid bare his secret calculations. Could this youth truly be so young?

“Tides turn in thirty years. Can you foresee Luo Cheng’s future trajectory?” Guan Yu continued, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Let me enlighten you – he already controls all entertainment venues on River Street. That brothel you occasionally frequent? Likely his property. And his ambitions won’t stop here. Your daughter gains far more than she loses with him.”

Beads of sweat formed on Shao’s palms. This was no ordinary man – a monster who knew even his illicit escapades! Did Guan Yu possess complete intelligence on him?

Swallowing dryly, Shao ventured timidly, “Does Luo Cheng truly wield such power?”

“Next time you visit those establishments,” Guan Yu chuckled, “mention his name. He’ll provide premium full-service hospitality. Experience it yourself.”

Thoroughly cowed, Shao glanced furtively around before sighing in relief at their unobserved conversation. “I only want my daughter’s security,” he conceded. “No repetition of her mother’s mistake marrying an incapable man like me. At your stature, deception serves no purpose.”

Secretly, Shao calculated new possibilities. Through his daughter’s connection to Luo Cheng – Guan Yu’s sworn brother – he could leverage this golden bridge. Future difficulties? Simply have his daughter petition Luo Cheng. Would Guan Yu remain indifferent?

Guan Yu smiled, indulging Shao’s transparent scheming. Carrots complemented sticks – pure coercion bred fragile alliances.

“Mayor Ma! Secretary Zhang!” The crowd stirred as two bespectacled middle-aged men entered with Boss Liu. Guan Yu vaguely recalled them from his bar’s opening ceremony.

Shao gaped at the city’s most powerful duo. “Mayor Ma! This is an unexpected honor!”

“Heard about the birthday banquet,” Mayor Ma said perfunctorily, scanning the room. “Secretary Zhang and I came for drinks.”

Shao nearly wept with pride. First Boss Liu forgiving debts, now municipal leaders gracing his fiftieth celebration! Even his bank manager never commanded such prestige.

As Shao prepared ingratiating remarks, Mayor Ma strode past him, beaming at Guan Yu with outstretched hands. “Younger Brother Guan! Remember me from your bar opening? When Boss Liu mentioned you here, Secretary Zhang and I had to pay respects! Join us for drinks, eh?”

The hall fell silent. Guests stared incredulously at Guan Yu – this youth commanding deference from both underworld kingpin and city leaders!

Shao stood transfixed, waves of shock crashing through him as Guan Yu calmly shook hands with the dignitaries. “My oversight,” Guan Yu replied evenly. “I should be toasting you. Three penalty drinks forthcoming.”

“Excellent!” Mayor Ma clapped. “To the banquet table!”

Boss Liu watched enviously as the trio departed. He’d invited the officials to discuss project approvals, yet they’d abandoned negotiations upon hearing Guan Yu’s presence. What hidden influence did this young man wield beyond his retired uncle’s shadow?

At the liquor-laden table, Shao Dan nudged Luo Cheng. “Who exactly is your friend? His reach spans both worlds!”

“That’s my sworn brother Guan Yu,” Luo Cheng declared proudly. “The venues I manage? All his properties. His true power?” He shook his head in awe. “Changed my destiny. My life is his.”

Shao Dan pouted playfully. “Speaking so devotionally before your girlfriend?”

Luo Cheng squeezed her hand. “You understand.”

Across the hall, Shao Guobang inhaled deeply. However events unfolded, his daughter must maintain this golden connection. Guan Yu’s mounting displays of influence – from underworld respect to governmental reverence – cemented his resolve.

The revelry peaked when Bank President Luo arrived. Initially dismissive of Shao’s promotion prospects after Liu Xing’s disgrace, the banker froze upon recognizing the municipal leaders. “Old Shao!” His tone turned honeyed. “Why didn’t you mention hosting such esteemed company?”

Guan Yu rose smoothly. “President Luo, I’m Guan Yu. Let’s ensure Shao receives proper workplace consideration.” His handshake carried unspoken weight.

“Naturally!” Mayor Ma interjected. “Join us, both of you.”

Shao trembled with emotion beside Guan Yu. When alcohol-loosened lips slipped out “If only you were my son-in-law,” Guan Yu nearly spat his wine.

The celebration concluded triumphantly. Guan Yu, aided by his healing system’s alcohol resistance, departed with Niu Le at dusk. “I’ll fetch Wenqing,” he said. “Your plans?”

The northeasterner grinned lewdly. “Explore Brother Luo’s establishments!”

“Don’t catch anything,” Guan Yu warned dryly, recalling Niu’s bedroom shortcomings.

En route, Liu Shilei’s call interrupted: “Skipping class again?”

“Overslept,” Guan Yu teased suggestively. “Certain... exertions.”

Her blush traveled through the phone. “Come to Central Avenue. You need winter clothes.”

At the bustling shopping district, Liu Shilei and Mo Ling awaited. “Finally!” Mo Ling snapped. “We’re freezing!”

“Shouldn’t have come then,” Guan Yu retorted.

Liu intervened: “Enough! Guan Yu needs proper attire.”

As they navigated crowded boutiques, Mo Ling whispered, “Why pamper this playboy?”

Liu smiled serenely. Mo Ling failed to recognize the transformation – from responsible teacher to devoted lover, she reveled in caring for Guan Yu’s needs. Let the world stare at their beauty; her contentment lay in selecting sweaters that would hug his frame.
