“Younger brother, you’ve said so much in one breath,” Yang Conghan’s expression darkened further. If Qing Ling’er was already Guan Yu’s woman, she would have no choice but to stay. But since their relationship wasn’t yet established—merely a kind gesture to help her—there were many alternatives. There was no need to keep her by his side. Finding her any ordinary job would suffice. Before any bond formed between them, it was best to keep her away from Guan Yu. Otherwise, given her striking beauty, she would inevitably become his “dish” sooner or later.

Yang Conghan’s thoughts churned, though her face betrayed nothing. Guan Yu grew anxious, and Qing Ling’er even more so. A monthly salary of ten thousand yuan was an unimaginable opportunity for someone like her.

Seeing Yang Conghan lost in contemplation, Guan Yu pressed, “Conghan, don’t you trust me? What reservations do you have? Ling’er is sharp. Though she lacks experience, her quick wit will catch her up in no time.”

Yang Conghan remained silent, still conflicted. Guan Yu, observing her hesitation, suddenly devised a tactic.

“Conghan, you don’t know—Ling’er’s life has been harsh,” he continued. “She grew up in a village. Her father died in battle over a decade ago, leaving her and her mother to struggle alone. For years, she’s worked odd jobs to save for tuition and support her ailing mother. A stable job is vital for her. With such an earnest soul, what is there to fear?”

Though Guan Yu deployed a “sympathy ploy,” Yang Conghan’s lips stayed sealed.

Ling’er’s tragic background did stir pity, but this wasn’t a charity. Many suffered worse fates. If money was the issue, Yang Conghan could simply offer her a sum. Yet, to secure her place in Guan Yu’s heart, she wavered.

“Conghan, are you humiliating me?” Guan Yu urged impatiently. “I already promised her beforehand. What’s holding you back?”

Yang Conghan sighed deeply. Fate was heaven’s design. If Qing Ling’er was destined for Guan Yu, no distance could keep them apart. Her pitiable circumstances and Guan Yu’s insistence left little room for refusal.

Frowning, she relented: “Fine. Ten thousand a month. Ling’er, give me your ID. We’ll sign the contract—you’ll be the HR manager.” Her tone dripped resignation.

Qing Ling’er could scarcely believe it. “Really? Thank you so much, Manager Yang!”

“Go sign the contract quickly,” Guan Yu said cheerfully. “Everyone here will look after you.” His joy mirrored hers.

Yang Conghan reasoned that any hire was a gamble. Ling’er seemed honest, and she’d need training regardless.

Guan Yu then asked, “Conghan, do you have dormitories here? Ling’er’s staying at Brother Pan’s apartment, but it’s a twenty-minute walk.”

“Twenty minutes?” Yang Conghan raised an eyebrow.

“She walks,” Guan Yu chuckled. “No car, remember?” It struck Yang Conghan anew—Ling’er was a village girl.

“The staff dorms here are… modest. Not sure if she’d adjust.”

“I’ll take anything!” Ling’er exclaimed. She’d lived in far worse. Brother Pan’s luxurious apartment felt alien, even rent-free.

“No,” Guan Yu interjected. “She should stay at Brother Yang’s place. Safer, and Huang Jing’s there too.”

Ling’er, touched by his concern, nodded softly.

As paperwork concluded, Yang Conghan declared, “Start tomorrow. Someone will train you. Perform well, and bonuses follow.”

“Thank you, Manager Yang!” Ling’er bowed politely.

“Drop the ‘Manager.’ Since you’re Guan Yu’s friend and I’m his girlfriend, call me Sister Yang.” The title was deliberate—a boundary drawn.

Ling’er’s eyes widened. So the legendary “Beauty of the City” was Guan Yu’s lover! Heroes deserved their beauties, she thought, a pang of longing quickly smothered. How could a village girl dare aspire to his world?

Later, at Xue Jing’s villa in Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu received a call from Wei Hongwei:

“Brother Guan, Sun Xu’s flaunting power again! His thugs just beat our Yu Gang members!”

“That ungrateful bastard!” Guan Yu roared. “Wait there. I’m coming!”

He sped to campus, parking haphazardly at the gate. New security guards—rumored under Du Zhao’s command—let him pass unchallenged.

“Emergency. Car stays,” Guan Yu barked.

“No problem,” a guard replied meekly.

Nodding, Guan Yu marched inward as the dismissal bell rang. Students flooded out, buzzing at his appearance.

“Wasn’t he hunted by cops? How’s he here unscathed?”

“Rumor said Du Zhao’s cop friend tortured him in jail! Lies, clearly.”

“Du Zhao’s no match. Guan Yu hospitalized Feng and Ran! He even exposed the principal and Teacher Liu’s affair!”

“Joining Yu Gang tomorrow…”

Whispers swirled—affairs with the principal’s wife, ambitions to usurp his seat. Yu Gang’s reputation soared, provoking Sun Xu’s recent attack on members by the lake.

Arriving at the scene, Guan Yu found only victims. “Why’d they fight?” he demanded.

Wei Hongwei shrugged. Among the twenty injured, some were ex-Brotherhood Society members. With Wang Hu absent (his father ill), Guan Yu declared coldly, “Let’s settle this.”

At the parking lot, he asked, “Which car’s Sun Xu’s?”

“Silver BMW 5 Series,” Wei Hongwei pointed.

“Smash it. I’ll handle consequences.”

Twenty youths descended with bats and pipes. Ten minutes later, the BMW resembled scrap.

“Who the hell smashed my car?!” Sun Xu stormed over, a girl in tow.

“Guess?” Guan Yu smirked.

Sun Xu, baby-faced but aged beyond his years, dialed police. Guan Yu mockingly called too: “Officers! My friends are beaten to pulp! Justice, please!”

“You coward!” Sun Xu spat. “Using cops? Real men handle things themselves!”

“You called first!” Guan Yu shot back.

As officers arrived, Guan Yu taunted, “Apologize on your knees, or this escalates.”

Sun Xu blustered but faltered. Crowds gathered, sensing his retreat.

“Let’s talk this out,” Sun Xu offered weakly.

“Hand over whoever beat Jia Bo last week,” Guan Yu demanded.

“School matters stay in school! Involving cops is disgraceful!”

“You started it!”

Police intervened, dispersing the crowd. The standoff continued—neither side backing down, reputations at stake.

Chapter 1957: Reconciliation

Sun Xu’s posturing crumbled. With Brotherhood Society remnants swelling his ranks, he’d grown arrogant. But Guan Yu’s retaliation—public, brutal—exposed his fragility.

As officers questioned the vandalism, Guan Yu countered: “His men attacked mine. Self-defense.”

Sun Xu, cornered, finally conceded. “Let’s… drop this. Truce?”

Guan Yu’s smirk widened. Victory, yet again.
