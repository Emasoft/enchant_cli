A purple flame erupted from Guan Yu’s palm, streaking toward Wei Buqun like a comet. Wei Buqun tried to summon his Profound Black Sword back, but his weakened cultivation rendered the blade’s return too sluggish. With no other choice, he leapt aside to evade.

Yet as he moved, he discovered another figure blocking his path—Shituo, who had just subdued the last Great Swordmaster.

“Perish, dwarf!”

Guan Yu’s initial strike missed, but he swiftly shifted stances for another assault. Wei Buqun, increasingly frenzied after multiple dodges, glared into the distance and roared, “Kyle! Quit gawking and act!”

Elder Kyle rushed forward, but before he could speak, Guan Yu fixed him with a piercing stare. “Elder Kyle, do you intend to aid this demon against us?”

“I—no! Brother Guan Yu, you’re a friend to our elven kin! Given your closeness with Lady Amy, how could I side against you?”

“Hahaha! Fools!” Wei Buqun’s laughter turned derisive. “To think I trusted elven lies! What a jest!”

Guan Yu pressed, “What do you mean? Speak truth now, and I might spare your life!”

“Spare me? Brat, you lack the standing to grant mercy! You think your ragtag alliance can defeat me? Naive!”

With a manic grin, Wei Buqun retrieved a golden pill from his spatial ring and swallowed it.

“What did he take?” Guan Yu demanded, turning to Shituo.

As overseer of a major auction house, Shituo paled in recognition. “Golden Saint Pill! Get Amy out—now!”

Without hesitation, Guan Yu grabbed Amy’s hand and bolted. Shituo covered their retreat while Kyle stood frozen, torn between allegiances.

Wei Buqun materialized before Kyle, seizing the elder’s throat with a bone-crunching grip. “Repeat your treachery, old fool. I dare you.”

Despite being an Archmage, Kyle flailed helplessly. “P-please, Guildmaster! This senile lapse won’t recur! Release me, and I’ll further your scheme!”

“Then chase them down,” Wei Buqun snarled, hurling Kyle away. “Fail me, and you die first!”

Terrified, Kyle scrambled after the fleeing group. Wei Buqun followed moments later.

As they raced toward the Forest of Elves, Guan Yu glanced back. “Elder Shituo, where’s Kyle?”

“Captured, likely. Focus on reaching the forest!”

“But why flee? That pill’s effect?”

“Golden Saint Pill—exceeds ten thousand gold coins at auction. It quintuples physical power for half an hour.”

“Fivefold? No wonder! But why would anyone—”

“The cost is steep. While it grants temporary might, it cripples future cultivation. Only the desperate use it.”

Guan Yu shuddered. Quintupled, Wei Buqun’s strength now rivaled a Sword Emperor’s. Five Sword Kings merged into one—an insurmountable foe.

A dark silhouette closed in behind them. “Who follows us, Elder Shituo?”

“Kyle. How’d he escape Wei Buqun? Stay wary—trust nothing he says.”

They accelerated, but Kyle’s voice soon wheedled: “Wait! I’m an elven elder! Show respect!”

Guan Yu snorted. “Respect? We saw Wei Buqun seize you. How’d a pill-enhanced Sword Emperor-level foe let you escape unscathed?”

Kyle’s retort died as Wei Buqun’s roar shook the trees. The guildmaster reappeared, robes tattered, hair wild, aura radiating lethal intent.

“Go!” Shituo urged. “I’ll hold him. Alert Elder Allen in the forest!”

“No! I’ll fight!” Guan Yu insisted.

“Youthful bravery won’t save you,” Wei Buqun mocked, brandishing his Profound Black Sword now tinged with bloody vapor. “Both die here!”

Shituo identified the technique with dread. “Slaughtering Blade—a Sword King’s ultimate strike!”

“How many blows can you withstand?” Guan Yu asked.

“One, if I wish to live.”

“Then I’ll face him.” Pushing Shituo toward Amy, Guan Yu focused. As Wei Buqun charged, Guan Yu timed his leap perfectly, riding the attack’s shockwave to vanish.

“Coward!” Wei Buqun bellowed, rounding on Kyle. “After him! Fail again, and you die first!”

Hidden nearby, Guan Yu overheard everything. “So Kyle’s their mole. Once we reach the forest, Locke’s conspiracy ends.”

When Kyle left on pursuit, Guan Yu struck. Channeling qi into his palm, he unleashed a violet blade of energy at Wei Buqun’s exposed back.

“Gathering Qi into Blades!”

The radiant projectile screamed toward its target—a gambit born of desperation and cunning.

**Chapter 1319: The Thirty-Six Stratagems**

Five merged Sword Kings—no defiance could overcome such might. By tier rules, Wei Buqun now equaled a Sword Emperor.

The pursuing shadow loomed closer until Shituo identified it as Kyle. “Why’s he unharmed? Wei Buqun’s enhanced—he shouldn’t escape!”

“Stay alert,” Guan Yu warned. “Whatever his lies, ignore them.”

As the Forest of Elves neared, fatigue gripped Guan Yu. “Elder Shituo, the chase ends. We’re safe at our borders, yes? His pill’s power fades soon.”

“Rest briefly,” Shituo agreed. “Even wounded, a lone Sword King dares not assault elven territory.”

Kyle’s petulant voice interrupted. “You disrespect an elder! Shall I bar your entry?”

Guan Yu laughed coldly. “By what right? We don’t visit for your sake. Explain how you fled Wei Buqun unscathed after his transformation.”

Kyle stammered as Wei Buqun’s roar announced his arrival—tattered, frenzied, aura murderous.

“Go!” Shituo urged. “I’ll delay him!”

“No. My fight.” Guan Yu’s eyes hardened. “Protect Amy. Watch Kyle.”

**Chapter 1320: I’ll Face Him**

Shituo sighed at Guan Yu’s resolve. “Youth’s courage… may it not cost dearly.”

Wei Buqun sneered. “Touching loyalty! I’ll bury you together!”

“Madman! Pills won’t save you!” Guan Yu retorted.

The Profound Black Sword descended, trees splintering in its wake. Guan Yu dodged, biding time. When the Slaughtering Blade’s crimson arc flashed, he sprang—using the attack’s momentum to vanish.

“Fleeing again?!” Wei Buqun roared, pill-enhanced muscles bulging.

Kyle stood paralyzed until Wei Buqun’s glare spurred him. “After them! Hesitate, and you die!”

From hiding, Guan Yu heard all. Kyle’s duplicity confirmed, he prepared his counterstroke. As Kyle left, Guan Yu struck—a violet blade piercing the chaos.

The fight’s climax hung on a gambit: outwit the enhanced foe before time ran out. Survival hinged on strategy, not brute strength—a true test of the Thirty-Six Stratagems.
