These luminous stones, if placed in Huaxia, would be considered rare treasures, meticulously stored by the wealthy or merchants. Yet here they held little value, serving merely as illumination.

Guanyu said, "Let's rest tonight and begin tomorrow. By the way, Master, Wang Jun will come to assist me tomorrow. I hope you'll permit this."

"Of course. I'll notify him after returning. It seems your recent procurement trip went smoothly," Xuanming replied.

Guanyu had already planned to collaborate secretly with Wang Jun in crafting miniature hand crossbows using premium materials, including solid mercury for arrows—a promise he'd sworn to Wang Xiaorong. This must remain hidden from Xuanming.

To avoid detection, they'd work covertly. Guanyu hoped Elder Wang and his disciples would prove capable. The immediate task involved creating a wooden crossbow prototype, disassembling its components for replication. The final quality would depend on Elder Wang's craftsmanship, which Guanyu trusted.

Though Elder Wang could theoretically craft the prototype himself, Guanyu feared delays from the elder's unfamiliarity with the schematics. To expedite matters, Guanyu resolved to assist personally while secretly using superior materials to forge an unparalleled hand crossbow for Wang Xiaorong.

The next morning revealed Elder Wang's innate genius. He rose early, eyes riveted to the blueprints spread across his desk.

Chief Lu arrived with several followers, including Wang Jun. "Guanyu! I've brought materials—see what's useful!" he called from afar.

Guanyu, still in his quarters within the courtyard compound Xuanming had arranged, emerged sleepily. The south wing housed living quarters, the north held furnaces, while the side buildings stored equipment.

After exchanging pleasantries with Elder Wang, Chief Lu hinted at his agenda: "Must I spell out my intentions?"

Guanyu sighed. "Chief Lu, rest assured. Though materials abound, your crossbow will follow Master's as priority."

Wang Jun added, "Later iterations will improve. You'll receive yours soon."

Satisfied, Chief Lu departed. Elder Wang immediately began experimenting with ironstone smelting, while Guanyu envisioned these crossbows revolutionizing Yunqing Sect's combat capabilities.

Meanwhile, Wang Xiaorong returned listlessly to the Demon Lord's domain. Sensing her mood, he wisely kept his distance while orchestrating San Tou's mission to Honglian Sect. With the Mid-July Festival approaching, securing the Eight-Drum Technique became imperative—this time, Guanyu mustn't interfere.

**Chapter 3927: Smoldering Rage**

San Tou entered, bowing. "You summoned me, Lord?"

"Yan Zhao's foot healed remarkably fast. Your 'Tri-Headed Medic' title holds merit," the Demon Lord remarked before shifting focus. "Prepare for Honglian Sect. Patriarch Sun Lianzi's birthday celebration approaches—chaos will provide cover."

He produced forged invitations. "Pose as Tigerclaw Mountain envoys. Infiltrate during the festivities."

San Tou hesitated. "Increased security around the Eternal Ice Lotus might hinder retrieving the Universal Compass. Perhaps wait until after the celebrations when vigilance wanes."

The Demon Lord nodded. "Scout first. Strike only if opportunity arises. Otherwise, retreat and regroup."

Two days later, San Tou and Yan Zhao blended into the crowd at Honglian Sect's gates at dawn. Yan Zhao's hatred for Guanyu simmered—every thought of his nemesis phantom-pained his healed ankle. "I'll carve him piece by piece!" he muttered.

Disguised as kitchen staff, they approached restricted areas. When guards blocked them, Yan Zhao improvised: "The Patriarch sent refreshments for those guarding the Eternal Ice Lotus!"

"Where's your token?" a guard demanded.

"Ah! Forgot it—we'll fetch it," Yan Zhao feigned, then offered the food. "Enjoy this while we return. Hardworking men deserve sustenance."

**Chapter 3928: Indebted by Another's Bread**

As the guards hesitated, Yan Zhao pressed: "Eat while hot! The Patriarch himself ordered this." The aroma weakened their resolve. One guard finally relented: "Quickly deliver it then! No dawdling!"

Saltmarsh smirked inwardly—hunger and flattery had breached the first defense. The true challenge lay ahead at the Eternal Ice Lotus' vault, but for now, their deception held.
