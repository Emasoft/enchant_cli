When she saw him standing with that doll-like girl, Feng Xin felt a cold grip tighten around her heart. After leaving the hotel, her mind went blank. In her fury, she slammed the accelerator in the bustling downtown—only to crash and injure herself instead of harming pedestrians. Just thinking about it made her seethe with frustration.

Why did she care so much? What was she even angry about?

No one in her life had ever indulged her like Guan Yu—comforting her as if she were a child. Strangely, she found herself craving his care, his tender concern.

She remembered how he’d scolded her when she injured her arm during a sparring match, then fed her with unexpected gentleness. The panic on his face earlier when he saw her hurt…

Recalling these moments, Feng Xin tilted her head and caught her reflection in the glass, her lips curling into a faint smile.

Half an hour later, doctors wheeled her out.

In the VIP ward, a crowd fussed over her while Guan Yu stood silently by the window, arms crossed.

“Hey! How dare you smoke here when Sister Xin’s injured? Get out!” A square-jawed young man barked at Guan Yu.

Guan Yu glanced at his cigarette, shrugged, and turned to leave.

Feng Xin, who’d been searching for Guan Yu with her eyes, darkened upon seeing this exchange. “Xiao Laohu (Little Tiger)! Get the hell out of my sight! Now!” She slapped the man’s head hard enough to make his comrades snicker.

The chastened “Little Tiger” scurried out like a scolded puppy while Fire Gang members exchanged knowing looks. Everyone knew how protective their leader was of Guan Yu—who’d be foolish to provoke him?

“All of you, scram! I’m not dying yet,” Feng Xin snapped from her hospital bed. When someone suggested hiring a nurse, she cut them off: “I don’t need anyone! Guan Yu stays. I need to talk to him.”

The room emptied instantly.

Feng Xin stared wordlessly at Guan Yu until he broke the silence: “How’d you crash? Weren’t you supposed to be careful?”

“You’re my bodyguard—and fake boyfriend! Yet you abandoned me for some girl!” she retorted, eyes blazing.

Guan Yu suppressed an eye-roll. She’d been the one storming off! Arguing logic with women was pointless. Noticing her plastered leg, he reached out gently.

“Oww…” Feng Xin whimpered theatrically when he touched her injury. Guan Yu fought a smile—the stoic “iron lady” was suddenly playing fragile? His healing powers told him the anesthesia hadn’t even worn off.

As golden light flowed from his palms, he teased: “Such a pretty leg… such a shame about the scar. Imagine wearing stockings with that—”

Feng Xin’s eyes widened in horror. “Call the dean! Get plastic surgeons here! No scars!”

Guan Yu blinked. Since when did she care about aesthetics? “Scars are normal! You never wear skirts anyway!”

“I don’t care!” She pounded the bed like a petulant child. “Get the dean!”

The hospital director arrived within minutes—the Fire Gang’s influence ensured swift compliance. Recognizing Guan Yu, the dean’s eyes lit up. “Why seek me when you have a miracle-worker here? Mr. Guan cured terminal patients without surgery! This fracture is child’s play for him.”

Feng欣 gaped. She’d dismissed Guan Yu’s healing claims as bravado. Now even the dean vouched for him?

“You’ll help, won’t you?” She turned pleading eyes to Guan Yu, who sighed in surrender.

As night fell, their banter softened. When Guan Yu mentioned finding a nurse, Feng Xin’s mood darkened again. Realization struck—she wanted him to stay.

Their fragile peace shattered when Feng欣 spotted the bedpan he’d bought. “Kill me instead!” she hissed, face flushing crimson.

“You’ll need it!” Guan Yu laughed, dodging her murderous glare.

Later, when he returned from buying sugar (fuel for his healing energy), he found her hobbling dangerously. “Are you trying to cripple yourself?!”

Through gritted teeth, she confessed: “I need… to use the bathroom.”

Guan Yu froze. The mighty gang leader, brought low by bodily needs. As he helped her balance, their hands brushed—a spark neither acknowledged. The night stretched ahead, filled with unspoken tensions and the quiet hum of healing light.
