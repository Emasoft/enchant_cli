“Have the Guts to Follow Me”

Hearing the male teacher’s words, Yang Lin finally snapped back to reality. The shock on his face gave way to shame. After casting a complicated glance at Guan Yu, he clutched his chest, staggered to his feet, and stumbled out of the classroom, leaving the entire class roaring with laughter.

“Liar.” Xu Ying shot a glare at Guan Yu, who was reading, and muttered under her breath.

Guan Yu turned to her, noticing the relieved expression on her face. He frowned slightly. “How did I lie to you?”

“If you were this skilled, you should’ve said so earlier!” She rolled her eyes at him, lips pursed. Guan Yu’s fluid movements earlier had been undeniably impressive. What girl wouldn’t admire a hero? Xu Ying, in the throes of adolescence, was no exception.

*So now I’m a liar? What a baffling woman. Besides, you never asked... Not that I’d have told you anyway.*

Though these thoughts crossed his mind, Guan Yu ignored Xu Ying. His focus now shifted to how he could arrange a meeting with Liu Shilei now that he’d enrolled in this elite private school.

The mere thought made his head throb. Liu Shilei had been the first woman he’d encountered decades ago. Much had happened between them back then. She’d always been pure-hearted and obedient. But twenty years had passed—would she even recognize him now? Could she accept him again after all this time?

Memories of their first comical meeting and everything that followed flooded his mind, pulling him entirely away from the classroom lecture.

Xu Ying stole glances at Guan Yu. The longing and world-weariness in his eyes inexplicably drew her in, until she found herself absorbed in his silent reverie.

When the bell finally rang, Guan Yu slowly emerged from his thoughts. Xu Ying blinked, cheeks flushing as she quickly averted her gaze.

*What’s wrong with me? I’ve only known this guy for two days! How could I space out like that? Xu Ying, get a grip!*

Staring at her blank notebook, she realized she hadn’t heard a single word the teacher had said all class.

Meanwhile, Wang Jun stewed in fury after returning to his classroom. Though not the top authority here, no one dared disrespect him—even outside school, his title “Brother Jun” carried weight.

*This isn’t over. So you know martial arts? Let’s see how you fare against supernatural beings.*

A vicious grin spread across Wang Jun’s face. His father, a prominent tycoon, had a sworn brother who’d once ruled the city’s underworld. After serving time and being left for dead in a mutated zone, the man had reemerged three years ago, now mingling effortlessly with high society. Even city officials treated him with deference.

Under this man’s command were Eight Vajra Guardians, each trained personally to surpass ordinary martial artists tenfold.

Without bothering about the ongoing class, Wang Jun stood and strode out to make a call. The teacher merely furrowed his brow but stayed silent—crossing the Wang family was beyond his paygrade.

“Understood, Uncle Yun. I’m counting on you... Yes, yes... I’ll visit soon... Goodbye!”

Hanging up, Wang Jun glanced toward Classroom Six and smirked coldly. As he turned to leave, a voice stopped him.

“Brother Jun... I’m sorry.” The voice sounded hollow, weighed by defeat.

“Yang Lin?” Wang Jun turned to see the changed youth and shrugged. “Forget it. That guy’s stronger than expected.”

When Yang Lin remained rooted, Wang Jun frowned. “Something else?”

Yang Lin’s jaw worked silently before he pleaded, “My father’s medical bills... Could you advance this month’s...”

Wang Jun grinned, slapping Yang Lin’s shoulder. “Prove yourself when I deal with that newbie this afternoon!”

As Wang Jun walked away, Yang Lin didn’t see his scornful smirk. Clenching his fists, Yang Lin punched the wall, face twisted in helpless anguish.

Guan Yu slept through classes. At noon, he sneaked a peek at the faculty schedule in the office. Discovering Liu Shilei’s absence today, his heart sank.

During evening self-study, with the teacher absent, the classroom buzzed with chatter. Guan Yu’s earlier heroics had captivated many girls, who now besieged him for contact info—all firmly rejected.

*Principles matter. Teachers are one thing—students? No way.*

Eventually overwhelmed, Guan Yu feigned sleep.

*BANG!*

The door—kicked open yet again since Guan Yu’s arrival—slammed against the wall.

“Newbie! Quit pretending to sleep—get up!”

Silence fell as the class stared at the嚣张的杂毛 (cocky punk) in the doorway. When the intruder saw Guan Yu “asleep,” he smashed a wooden rod against the doorframe.

Xu Ying nudged Guan Yu. “Hey. You’ve got visitors.”

Guan Yu, who hadn’t truly been sleeping—cultivators of his level needed no rest—feigned annoyance. “Persistent pests.”

He glared at the punk. “What now?”

“Man enough to follow me?”

“You decide if I’m a man? Seen proof?”

“Wanna test me? I’m straight—no time for your bent crap. Tell your ‘Brother Jun’ to play with himself.” Guan Yu’s retort dripped scorn. In verbal sparring, he outclassed these amateurs by light-years.

The punk raised his rod but checked himself, remembering orders.

“Quit yapping! Got guts? Follow me!” He stormed off, fearing further insults.

“Don’t go—it’s a trap,” Xu Ying warned. Strangely, since yesterday, she’d felt inexplicably drawn to Guan Yu—though she chalked it up to finally meeting someone who could match her wit.

“Go kick his ass, handsome!”

“We’re rooting for you!”

The class—mostly privileged kids who’d be tyrants in ordinary schools—egged him on.

“Might as end this once.” Guan Yu winked at Xu Ying and strode out.

Fuming, Xu Ying hesitated, then followed. Most students stayed behind, betting on Guan Yu’s fate.

“He’ll be hospitalized a month—$500!”

“He’ll return—$300!”

Unaware of being gambling fodder—though he’d have wagered heavily on himself—Guan Yu soon reached the basketball court, now a nighttime battleground where Wang Jun had previously stabbed two rivals.

Twenty figures awaited. Wang Jun stood flanked by four men. Guan Yu nodded approvingly—these lackeys were decent. In his early copper-coin days, they’d have crushed him. Now?

“Feng-ge, that’s the guy!” Wang Jun whispered to a red-haired man. “I want him carried out.”

“Easy peasy.” The man giggled, fluttering a limp wrist.

Guan Yu’s enhanced hearing caught this, making him gag. *Is Wang Jun actually into men?*

“Yang Lin!” Wang Jun tossed a银行卡 (bank card) and dagger on the ground. “Hurt him, and your dad’s bills...”

Yang Lin stared at the items, humiliation burning before resolve hardened. Snatching the dagger, he charged Guan Yu.

“Why target Xu Ying? WHY?!”

Yang Lin’s wild stabs lacked skill. Guan Yu sidestepped, kicking his wrist. The dagger clattered as Yang Lin swung a desperate punch.

Guan Yu arched backward, palm striking Yang Lin’s ribs. Blood sprayed, but Yang Lin kept attacking—kicking, headbutting—until Guan Yu “knocked him out” with a controlled kick, secretly channeling healing energy.

Wang Jun retrieved the bank card and tossed it to Yang Lin. “Password’s unchanged.”

Clutching the card in the dark, Yang Lin’s eyes glistened with suppressed rage.

Wang Jun smirked at Guan Yu. “You’re good, but tonight you’re done. Fail, and I’ll take your surname!”

“Guan Jun? ‘Champion’? More like ‘Champion Shit-Eater.’ Your whole family champions?”

“DIE!” Wang Jun sputtered, enraged.

The red-haired man minced forward. “Such sharp wit! Join me, sweetie?”

“I’m not hiring a son-birther.”

“YOU!” The man attacked, palm glowing yellow. Guan Yu met it head-on.

*BOOM!*

The red-haired man staggered back, shocked. His subsequent energy projectiles harmlessly dissipated against Guan Yu’s impervious form.

The other three henchmen exchanged greedy looks. *He must have a protective treasure!*

“Let me handle this!” A bald henchman cracked his knuckles.

“No—my turn!” Another intervened.

As they squabbled, Yang Lin rose, dagger hidden, eyes blazing with newfound resolve...
