Due to the abundance of resin combined with scattered resin barrels on the ground, an immediate explosion erupted. At this critical moment, Guan Yu and his companions stood dangerously close to the windows, inevitably caught in the blast's aftermath.

Chaos erupted as everyone clashed in disarray. Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu summoned the Imperial Seal without hesitation, unleashing its final stored spell.

This wind-elemental spell conjured a tornado-like vortex before Guan Yu. The howling gale persisted for nearly twenty seconds, not only diverting the explosive shockwaves but also tearing off doors, windows, and even the roof of the grand hall.

Debris carried by the hurricane injured many imperial guardsmen. Though the spell lacked lethal force, its effectiveness in clearing obstacles proved remarkable.

The imperial guards recoiled in terror at this display of power. Their crimson-clad commander shouted, "Charge! Rescue the Prince!"

Zou Wuhui, who had been awaiting this moment, instantly surged forward to engage the guards.

Despite numerical superiority, the palace guards' morale crumbled. Even their squad leaders knew exposure to the Emperor would bring dire consequences, filling them with dread.

Their combat effectiveness plummeted. Guan Yu, fighting alongside Prince Zou and Wang Xiaorong, carved a path through the chaos. The Soul-Reaping Blade in his hand resembled a bloodthirsty dragon, sending opponents flying with each swing. Those fortunate lost limbs; the unlucky lost heads.

As Guan Yu's martial prowess became apparent, the guards hesitated. Even their sergeants fell within two strikes of his blade.

Yet exhaustion weighed on Guan Yu's group. "They keep coming! For every one we defeat, two more take their place!" Guan Yu panted.

The crimson-clad allies struggled on the periphery, their weaker combat skills making containment difficult. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi remained observers, reserving their limited battle capabilities for potential spellcasting.

"Retreat! Full withdrawal!" a squad leader suddenly bellowed.

Within moments, the royal guards vanished like morning mist, leaving only the wounded as evidence of the clash.

The aftermath revealed Guan Yu's brutal efficiency - a landscape of severed limbs surrounded him. The group puzzled over the sudden retreat. "Why abandon their mission to kill the Prince?" The answer lay in their exposed identities - continuing would only compound their crimes.

Moreover, the assassination of Minister Zhang, a second-rank official, created an untenable situation even for palace guards. Denial became their only escape.

"Younger brother! Are you unharmed? This failure rests on me!" Zou Wuhui knelt bloodied before the Prince.

"The fault lies with my misplaced trust in Minister Zhang," Prince Zou replied magnanimously. "Attend to the wounded. Find physicians immediately!"

As the group relocated to an inn, Guan Yu warned, "This place is compromised. Imperial investigators will descend soon - likely the Emperor's Guards. Should they take the case..."

Prince Zou nodded grimly. "The Second Prince will frame me for Zhang's death. We need irrefutable evidence."

"Those servant women from the hall!" Wang Xiaorong interjected. "They witnessed everything. If found..."

Guan Yu shook his head. "The guarded mansion makes retrieval dangerous. Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi will scout after dark."

Discussions turned to escape plans. "We must hide the Prince until he can reach the Emperor," Hong Ren suggested. "The Emperor's Guards won't listen to reason."

Consensus formed around disguise and concealment. Wang Xiaorong revealed Demon Soul Sect safehouses marked by flame symbols on tavern signs. After scouting several streets, they identified the Five Fragrances Tavern - its weathered sign bearing subtle fire motifs.

Inside the nearly empty establishment, Wang Xiaorong demanded to see the manager. A calculating clerk observed them while servers feigned ignorance. Guan Yu noted the subtle power dynamics - ordinary staff unaware of their tavern's true nature as a Demon Soul Sect outpost.

As afternoon shadows lengthened, the race against imperial retribution continued...
