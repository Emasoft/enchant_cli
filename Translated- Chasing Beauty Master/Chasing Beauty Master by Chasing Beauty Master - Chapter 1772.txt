“Right Envoy had been waiting for their report. Though uncertain about the true nature of the pool below, the three men cleverly ascended without donning their outer robes, clutching the garments in their hands as they reported, “Right Envoy, the pool is extremely deep and dark. We couldn’t reach the bottom, but near the cliff wall, there’s a powerful outlet current. The water’s destination remains unclear—its force prevented us from venturing further.”

“Good. It seems that’s merely an outlet. We’ll need to search elsewhere,” Right Envoy replied. “Dry your clothes first to avoid catching cold.”

“Right Envoy,” one of the men added, “while submerged, we noticed a protruding rock with an unusually black underside. It struck us as peculiar.”

“Black?” Right Envoy echoed curiously. The moment she spoke, Guan Yu abruptly dove downward without hesitation, determined to investigate.

The torrential waterfall crashed against the jutting rock, its spray glinting under the radiant sun to form a resplendent rainbow suspended midair. Siqi, Wang Jun, and the others hurried to the cliff’s edge after witnessing Guan Yu’s leap.

Guan Yu hovered around the anomalous rock, darting back and forth without a foothold. Though capable of flight, maintaining stationary levitation eluded him. After a while, he retreated from the waterfall’s cascade, stabilizing himself midair at a distance before unsheathing his Soulbreaker Blade.

Channeling his inner energy, he unleashed a fierce slash toward the rock. He had already deduced its strangeness—its black underside defied explanation, smooth as glass and utterly unlike ordinary stone. The verdant hues elsewhere could be attributed to moss, but the inky darkness hinted at something unnatural.

A crescent-shaped arc of Dou Qi surged forth. The moment it struck the waterfall, a thunderous boom echoed. The torrent split momentarily—a fleeting pause, less than a heartbeat—before resuming as though untouched.

Onlookers from the Demonic Soul Sect murmured in admiration, but their awe turned to shock as Guan Yu suddenly lunged toward the cliff at breakneck speed, seemingly intent on self-destruction.

“Is he mad?” Right Envoy exclaimed, but Guan Yu had already reached the waterfall. Just as collision seemed inevitable, he vanished without a sound, swallowed by the cascade as though dissolving into water.

“What happened? Where’s Guan Yu?” Wang Jun cried, bewildered. Siqi, trembling, opened her eyes to find him gone.

Right Envoy’s eyes flashed with realization. “Everyone, follow me!” she shouted, darting toward the waterfall. The sect members surged after her, plunging through the veil of water one by one. Siqi and Wang Jun exchanged glances before hastening after them, leaving the Cloud Azure Sect disciples behind.

**[Chapter 4636: Regret]**

Inside the cave, darkness enveloped Guan Yu. He waited for his vision to adjust, finding himself in a spacious tunnel over two meters high. The protruding black stone marked the entrance. As he pressed forward, Right Envoy and her followers arrived, equally blind but undeterred.

The damp, uneven tunnel sloped downward, its jagged walls and floor treacherous. Water dripped ceaselessly from above. Without a torch, Guan Yu relied on his keen sight, navigating low passages on hands and knees. Behind him, Wang Jun ignited a makeshift torch using his outer robe and dagger, illuminating their path.

“Stay close,” Wang Jun urged Siqi. The trio trailed the Demonic Soul Sect, their light revealing ankle-deep water in the narrowing tunnel. Guan Yu, far ahead, leapt from stone to stone, outpacing the cultivators who struggled through the mire.

Hours passed. Fatigue gnawed at Guan Yu, yet the tunnel offered no divergence. He wondered if he’d strayed from the path to the Eight-Sided Drum technique. The Demonic Soul Sect, lagging behind, debated abandoning pursuit until Right Envoy insisted, “He must be ahead!”

Doubt plagued all—had they been lured into a trap? The tunnel’s endless descent seemed interminable. Just as despair set in, Guan Yu detected a distant sound. Wind. Renewed vigor propelled him forward until he found stairs ascending to a blocked exit. Heaving the boulder aside, he emerged—only to be slammed backward by a colossal force.

**[Chapter 4637: Mercy]**

Dazed, Guan Yu stared up at a towering gray-and-white ape in a vast, man-made chamber. The beast roared, swinging fists like boulders. “I meant no intrusion,” Guan Yu called, dodging. “Let me pass peacefully!”

The ape charged, undeterred. Guan Yu’s eyes hardened. “So be it.” He unsheathed his blade, resolve steeled. To escape, he’d have to conquer this guardian—but whether victory led to the Eight-Sided Drum or greater peril remained unseen.
