“I fear you lack the capability.”

Guan Yu remained defiant, his arrogance surpassing even Master Ran’s.

“Truthfully, I dislike killing,” Master Ran sneered. “But my son has suffered immense psychological trauma. His spirit is now broken. To avenge him, you must die.”

“Master Ran, have you considered the consequences?”

“Consequences? I never dwell on such trivialities.”

“Are you a clown sent by monkeys? Your son’s mind was already rotten long before this. I merely rid the world of a pest.”

“Insolent! Bind his legs!”

Knowing verbal sparring wasted time, Master Ran ordered his men to restrain Guan Yu. He wanted to prolong the torment—first immobilizing the young man, then beating him senseless.

Several henchmen approached with ropes, wrapping Guan Yu from head to toe like a mummy. He offered no resistance, letting them truss him effortlessly.

“Finished?” Guan Yu taunted. “What’s next?”

Enraged by his audacity, Master Ran snatched a baseball bat and lumbered forward. His bloated frame heaved with each step. Pressing his yellowed teeth inches from Guan Yu’s face, he snarled, “Let’s see you mock me now!” The bat swung upward—

*Spit!* Guan Yu’s saliva landed directly in Master Ran’s mouth. In one fluid motion, Guan Yu leaped, his entire body flipping mid-air as he delivered a sweeping tail strike that sent the rotund man sprawling.

Coughing violently, Master Ran rolled across the ground, desperately trying to expel the foul taste. When efforts proved futile, he drew a pistol, trembling with fury. “I planned to prolong your suffering, but you’ve hastened your demise!”

Guan Yu’s expression hardened. At this proximity, dodging a bullet demanded absolute focus.

“Stop! Lower your weapon!”

A sharp feminine voice cut through the tension. Six cars screeched to a halt, disgorging over twenty figures. Guan Yu blinked in surprise—Pan Xiaoxia had arrived.

She rushed to untie him, though he could’ve easily broken free. “I alerted my brother after seeing you kidnapped,” she explained as Pan Taisheng emerged from the crowd.

Guan Yu noted the unexpected show of force. “Young Master Pan, do you oppose me?” Master Ran growled.

“This man is my future brother-in-law. I insist you release him.”

“Release him? He crippled my son! Not even the heavens will save him today!”

Both factions brandished weapons—guns versus blades—as tensions neared eruption.

Guan Yu whispered urgently to Pan Xiaoxia, “Your concern touches me, but these numbers complicate matters. I can’t protect everyone from bullets. Leave now!”

“Stubborn fool!” she retorted. “Without us, you’d already be dead!”

Knowing arguments proved futile, Guan Yu shifted tactics. “Master Ran, only I can cure your son. Order your men to stand down—unless you want him broken forever.”

The threat struck home. “Speak truth!”

“Would I lie amidst this standoff?”

Reluctantly, Master Ran lowered his gun. Pan Taisheng mirrored the gesture. “Fail to heal him, and your suffering will eclipse hell itself. Bring my son!”

Emerging from a car, Ran Qiang trembled at Guan Yu’s sight. A foul stench erupted as he soiled himself.

“Disgusting!” Pan Xiaoxia covered her nose.

Guan Yu remained calm. Ran Qiang’s bowels and psyche were irreparably damaged—the young tyrant would forever void himself at Guan Yu’s presence, a living shadow of terror.

Master Ran’s hope shattered. “You’ve destroyed my heir! Die!” He raised the pistol again—

“Who dares threaten my son-in-law?”

A resonant voice echoed as Master Yang emerged with reinforcements, his recovered vitality radiating authority. Pan Xiaoxia had wisely summoned Yang Conghan’s family.

“Master Yang! You’re recovered!”

The patriarch nodded. “Thanks to you and Conghan. From this day, Yang resources are yours to command.”

Master Ran paled. Yang Conghan coldly stated, “Our families severed ties when you exploited my father’s illness. Today settles old debts.”

Yang forces encircled the Ran faction. Outnumbered and outgunned, Master Ran spat final threats before retreating.

At Yang Manor, celebrations ensued. Master Yang offered half his empire in gratitude, but Guan Yu deferred. “Your daughter’s efforts merit equal praise.”

“Nonsense!” Yang Conghan’s father boomed. “When will you two wed? This old man yearns for grandchildren!”

Blushing, Yang Conghan swatted his arm as Guan Yu chuckled nervously. “Such plans require... time.”

“Then take it!” Master Yang laughed. “But don’t make me wait too long!”

Amidst laughter, alliances solidified—a new era dawned where loyalty and cunning would face greater trials ahead.
