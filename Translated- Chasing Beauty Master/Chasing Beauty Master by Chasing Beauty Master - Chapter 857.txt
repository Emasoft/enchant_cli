“Sure, if you want to use it, just take it. You don’t need to ask me,” Yang Conghan said. Truth be told, everything Yang Conghan owned might as well belong to Guan Yu—perhaps even the entire Yang family someday. Borrowing a car now was hardly worth mentioning.

Zhang Han, ever the curious child, immediately asked, “Big Brother, why do you need Sister Yang’s car? You’re not planning mischief, are you?”

Guan Yu couldn’t help but smile at her adorable antics, though he maintained a serious tone. “A friend’s younger sister is getting married, and I’m helping lead the wedding procession. How could I possibly do anything improper?”

As he spoke, he gently pinched Zhang Han’s chubby cheeks. At the mention of a wedding, she leapt from her computer chair and tugged his sleeve. “Picking up the bride? I want to go too! Take me with you!”

She buzzed around him like an excitable toddler. Guan Yu softened his voice. “The drive is long. Stay home with the others, alright? Be good.”

Unexpectedly, Zhang Han’s protests intensified. She sprang into his arms with unshakable faith that he’d catch her—which he did, just before she would’ve tumbled to the floor. Nestling against him, she whined, “No! I’m going! I insist!”

Guan Yu sighed. The girl was a walking disaster; taking her risked unforeseen chaos. Just then, Xue Jing intervened. “Hannah, if you leave with Big Brother, who’ll help slay tonight’s dungeon boss? They’re dropping rare loot!”

Chapter 2212: Premium Class

Zhang Han’s eyes lit up. The evening’s in-game event did promise epic rewards. Slipping from Guan Yu’s embrace, she relented. “Fine, I’ll stay. But bring me snacks when you return!”

“Of course. Mountains of them,” Guan Yu promised. With the car secured, he prepared to fetch Qing Ling’er.

Yang Conghan hesitated. “Guan Yu... using my Porsche for a wedding procession... is it... appropriate?” She knew her limited-edition model, while expensive, resembled standard Porsches to untrained eyes—lacking the prestige he might need.

Guan Yu understood her concern. He’d chosen her white car both for its bridal symbolism of enduring love and its pristine condition. Though his own Hummer exuded power, it lacked refinement for the occasion.

“My grandfather gifted me a white Bentley Continental for my birthday,” Yang Conghan offered. “You should take that instead.”

Guan Yu recalled the sleek coupe—a 9-million-yuan masterpiece of understated luxury. Driving this to the countryside would cause a sensation. Though touched by her sacrifice (she’d barely used the new car), he accepted graciously. “Thank you. This helps immensely.”

When the Arctic-white Bentley arrived at the garage, its elegance dwarfed every vehicle present. The sculpted body radiated sophistication with a playful edge. Guan Yu’s grateful glance spoke volumes. For Yang Conghan—notoriously possessive of her belongings—allowing others (even a bride) into her cherished car demonstrated profound growth.

Zhang Han clamored to explore the interior. Guan Yu nearly promised her a similar car before biting his tongue. Gifting such extravagance after forgetting Yang’s birthday would spark fury. “Be good now,” he deflected. To Yang, he added, “I’ll handle it with care.”

Her heart fluttered at his gratitude. Supporting her man, she realized, was its own reward.

Chapter 2213: Fortune Favors the Virtuous

Arriving at Pan Taisheng Apartments, Guan Yu found Qing Ling’er waiting. Her eyes widened at the approaching Bentley. “Get in!” he called.

The car’s nimble handling rivaled his modified Hummer. Ling’er hesitated, intimidated by the immaculate interior. “Hurry! The countryside awaits,” he urged, opening the gullwing door.

Settling into the supple leather seat, she marveled, “Thank you, Big Brother Guan! This car’s breathtaking!”

“Enough ‘thank yous’,” he chuckled. “Credit goes to Sister Yang.”

Ling’er blushed, recognizing Yang Conghan’s signature fragrance. During the drive, she explained her family situation: her mother had already left for the rural wedding, while her father—still hiding from past enemies—stayed behind.

Guan Yu listened intently. “Uncle Qing’s health?”

“Stable, but the venom...” Ling’er’s voice faltered. Despite scouring medical texts, she’d found no cure for his decades-old snake toxin.

“He’ll pull through,” Guan Yu reassured. “Good fortune follows the righteous.”

As they entered the impoverished Liutun Village, the Bentley drew crowds. Children chased the exotic machine, while awestruck villagers gossiped: “That’s Old Qing’s girl! City life made her rich!”

Ling’er waved at relatives through the window. The car crawled past weathered cottages to a tidy courtyard—her aunt’s home. A slaughtered hog simmered for tomorrow’s feast.

Chapter 2214: Buying You One

Dusk settled as Guan Yu parked beside a rickety fence. Villagers swarmed the Bentley. A wide-eyed boy identified it: “Bentley Continental! This costs more than our whole village!”

Amid the chaos, Ling’er’s aunt emerged. Three days of festivities awaited—but first, Guan Yu had to navigate a gauntlet of curious kin.

“Mommy, I want this car!” a girl begged.

Her mother laughed. “When Daddy returns, we’ll buy ten!”

Ling’er stepped out, greeted by gasps. Her aunt’s tearful embrace said everything: the prodigal niece had arrived in style.
