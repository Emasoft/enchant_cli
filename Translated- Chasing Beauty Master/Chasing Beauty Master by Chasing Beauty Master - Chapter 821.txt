“Guan Yu and Jin Hua huddled in a corner of the protective barrier, scarcely daring to breathe. Guan Yu, now drenched in sweat, still managed to stealthily give Jin Hua a thumbs-up, acknowledging the brilliance of her strategy.

Chapter 3002: Exhaust You to Death

The Unicorn Water Buffalo finally ceased its assault. Having lost sight of its targets within the massive barrier now completely filled with Jin Hua's dense black mist—a smog so thick it remained perfectly contained by the shield—the beast halted its chaotic water bullet sprays.

Within the mist-shrouded barrier, the blinded creature's random attacks gradually stilled. Guan Yu and Jin Hua pressed themselves against a corner of the magical enclosure, their suppressed breaths barely stirring the air. Guan Yu's sweat-drenched face glistened as he silently praised Jin Hua's clever maneuver through another covert thumbs-up.

The stalemate stretched on—neither daring to move, for the water buffalo's projectiles flew faster than arrows from a repeater crossbow. As the beast lost its targets, Guan Yu's mind raced. Their best hope lay in the creature dismissing its barrier, allowing the toxic fog to disperse. Guan Yu poised himself to flee the moment the shield dropped, desperate to escape this living artillery piece.

Yet the buffalo showed no signs of retracting its barrier. Jin Hua's poisonous mist—harmless to Guan Yu under her protection—contained both paralytic and corrosive elements. Unfortunately, the creature's natural toxin resistance rendered these effects useless.

Guan Yu's thoughts churned. The safest spot might be beneath the beast's belly where its projectiles couldn't curve, but the toxic lake water made this impossible. Through the mist, Jin Hua tracked their foe's movements. "Since we can't flee," Guan Yu whispered, "we'll fight guerrilla-style. Split up."

Their attempted separation failed when Guan Yu lost visual contact in the dense fog. Regrouping, they opted for coordinated hit-and-run attacks. Guan Yu's dagger strikes against vulnerable spots—belly, neck—barely scratched the creature's freakishly thick hide.

A daring lunge at the beast's eye met with a point-blank water blast. The buffalo's sudden head swing forced Guan Yu into a desperate dodge. As the creature shifted position, drinking and spraying lake water, the mist began precipitating—black particles falling like weighted ash.

"Damn clever beast," Guan Yu cursed as the dissipating fog revealed their position. Scooping up Jin Hua, he resumed their desperate barrier-edge sprint. Jin Hua released more mist from her artifact Xiao Fen, though the stagnant air grew increasingly toxic.

Even Guan Yu's cultivation-enhanced endurance strained under the foul atmosphere. Jin Hua, flushed with stubborn pride, intensified her mist output. "Hmph! Stupid monster," she spat. "I'll exhaust you to death, you bastard!"

Chapter 3003: Tunnel Escape

As the buffalo appeared to tire, ceasing its water sprays, Guan Yu hoped the barrier would soon drop. Instead, the creature sank beneath the lake's surface, leaving an ominous calm.

"We can't wait for its return," Guan Yu decided, brandishing his dagger. "We'll tunnel out."

His initial excavation attempts proved futile—the barrier extended downward like liquid. Spotting a crater from previous attacks, Jin Hua pointed out the shield's adaptive nature. Undeterred, Guan Yu revised his plan: "We're not digging a pit, but a tunnel. The barrier can't follow if we don't displace soil."

Their frantic digging commenced—Guan Yu with dagger and tent poles, Jin Hua transporting dirt. Progress was agonizingly slow, both warriors soon coated in grime. Just as breakthrough neared, bubbles erupted on the lake's surface.

"Damn it all!" Guan Yu swore, redoubling his efforts. Jin Hua distracted the emerging beast with fresh mist and needle attacks, dancing along the barrier's edge as water bullets tore the ground around her.

Chapter 3004: Breakthrough

With final desperate strokes, Guan Yu breached the barrier's edge. A hurried wave summoned Jin Hua through their narrow tunnel. As they emerged outside the shield, the lake's surface boiled with the enraged buffalo's resurgence—but its prisoners had vanished.

The pair collapsed on safe ground, filthy and exhausted yet triumphant. Guan Yu's hands trembled around his battered dagger, while Jin Hua's smudged face broke into a victorious grin. Behind them, the Unicorn Water Buffalo's furious bellows echoed across the poisoned lake, its barrier shimmering uselessly around empty air.”
