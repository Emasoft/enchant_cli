“A wheelchair, of course, doesn’t exist here,” Guan Yu remarked, observing the bamboo splints strapped to Men Gongzi’s legs. “This method is highly detrimental to your recovery.”

“Men Gongzi, I’ve come today to help you. Do you trust me?” Guan Yu said earnestly.

“Of course. Since Guan Yu treats me as a brother, I shall regard him as a friend.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Good. First, the broken bones in your legs cannot be properly set with such bandages. Have someone bring soft white cloth. I’ll rebandage them properly.”

Soon, a servant arrived with a large roll of coarse white cotton. Guan Yu sighed inwardly—without proper medical gauze, this would have to suffice.

Gritting through the pain, Men Gongzi allowed Guan Yu to rewrap his legs. Layers of cloth tightly secured the bamboo splints, creating a sturdier support.

“Guan Yu,” Men Gongzi chuckled, “this feels remarkably better! The tight binding brings comfort and security. I can even move my legs slightly now.”

“How miraculous!” Xiao Zhi exclaimed skeptically, leaning closer. “You just applied it, and he can already move?”

“Common sense, nothing more,” Guan Yu replied. “The cool weather favors this method. The padding protects the injury, and the compression aids bone alignment.”

“Enough delays!” Xiao Zhi interjected. “Show us this ‘wheelchair’ you mentioned!”

Men Gongzi added eagerly, “Yes, where is it? Have you brought it?”

“I don’t have it… yet.” Guan Yu paused for effect. “But the City Lord’s Manor is well-stocked. Crafting one should be simple.”

“Name the materials. I’ll have them fetched immediately.”

Guan Yu lifted a box from the table. “I’ve brought most tools. We’ll need wooden planks and two small carriage wheels.”

Xiao Zhi pointed at the box. “So these odd purchases were for Men Gongzi’s wheelchair?”

Guan Yu smiled cryptically, unwilling to boast prematurely.

“Take whatever you need from the manor,” Men Gongzi declared. “My servants will assist you.”

After gathering materials from the stables and workshops, Guan Yu directed the construction. Servants carved wood, forged metal fittings, and assembled the frame. Despite crude tools and heavy wheels, a functional—if bulky—wheelchair took shape.

“Incredible!” Siqi gasped as Men Gongzi tested the contraption. Though cumbersome, it allowed mobility.

“Even legless individuals could roam freely now!” Aze marveled.

“Time and materials limited its refinement,” Guan Yu admitted. “But it serves its purpose. Let’s present it.”

Men Gongzi’s eyes lit upon seeing the odd device. “Brilliant! With this, I needn’t remain confined!” He gestured excitedly as servants helped him aboard.

GuanYu explained the footrests and steering, though high thresholds remained an obstacle. Men Gongzi insisted on hosting a feast, but GuanYu declined, citing urgent matters.

As they departed, soldiers reported visitors—a man and woman demanding the City Lord’s attention. GuanYu’s suspicion flared: “A tall, gaunt man and a… provocative-looking woman?”

“Exactly!” Men Gongzi slammed the wheelchair arm. “Mobilize the guards! Those Red Lotus Sect bastards have delivered themselves to us!”

The group gaped at the finished wheelchair. Though rudimentary, its ingenuity awed them. Men Gongzi reveled in his newfound freedom, vowing retribution against his attackers.

Yue Jing and Lai Lixia of the Red Lotus Sect arrived defiantly, unaware their victims had identified them. Having come to protest their sect’s unjust arrests, they instead walked into Men Gongzi’s wrath—a trap sprung by Guan Yu’s cunning revelations.
