“Wen Ya suddenly stopped in her tracks, looking coldly at Guan Yu with a sneer. ‘Are you trying to make me realize that without you, I’m just a woman who can be bullied by anyone? Guan Yu, let me tell you – I don’t need your pity or your help. Ever since you entered my life, everything has been chaotic. The best way you can help me is by staying far away!’

Guan Yu froze as Wen Ya turned and walked away after delivering this blow.

After a dazed moment, Guan Yu’s expression darkened. He swiftly caught up to Wen Ya, grabbing her wrist and forcing her to face him. ‘I said you’re my woman now – that’s an unchangeable fact whether you admit it or not! I didn’t use underhanded methods to keep you by my side. I just can’t stand seeing my woman being bullied by others. Because only I have the right to bully them!’

Wen Ya laughed coldly, throwing Guan Yu a contemptuous glance before wrenching her arm free and leaving without looking back.

Chapter 859: Relaxing in Jiangnan

As Guan Yu walked toward the dormitory, Wen Ya’s final disdainful look haunted him – that mixture of scorn and mockery.

What did it all mean?

He’d rushed to help when she was in trouble, beaten up policemen, and berated the principal’s secretary. Yet all he received in return was colder than a stranger’s indifference.

‘Damn it, does this count as getting dumped?’ Guan Yu laughed self-deprecatingly.

Pushing open the dorm door, he was met with the pungent smell of liquor. Niu Le and Wang Zhen sat facing each other, guzzling alcohol with bitter expressions while Tian Hao played bartender.

‘What’s wrong with them?’ Guan Yu asked.

‘Girl trouble,’ Tian Hao answered through mouthful of peanuts. ‘Both got dumped yesterday. Pathetic!’

Niu Le slammed his bottle. ‘Who’s pathetic? That bitch left because she found someone handsomer! I’m better off without her!’

Tian Hao smirked. ‘Admit it – she said your dick was too small!’

The room erupted in laughter. Niu Le’s face flushed crimson as he chugged the remaining liquor before passing out.

Chapter 860: Departure

At dawn, the group gathered at the campus gate. Tian Hao pleaded, ‘Can I bring Hu Yuhan? One more won’t—’

‘No!’ Wang Zhen cut him off. ‘This trip’s for healing broken hearts, not your romance!’

When Guan Yu arrived with three stunning companions – Wen Qing, Mo Ling, and Zhao Jing’er – the mood shifted dramatically.

‘I thought you said you were heartbroken?’ Wang Zhen muttered.

Guan Yu scratched his head. ‘Well... I might have exaggerated. Let’s focus on having fun!’

The procession of two cars set off for Jiangnan, the picturesque water town. Zhao Jing’er’s camera clicked incessantly, capturing every bridge and cobblestone street.

‘Go ahead,’ Guan Yu encouraged the radiant girl. ‘We’ll buy more memory cards if needed!’

Her laughter echoed through ancient alleyways as the group began their journey of healing – or perhaps, new beginnings.
