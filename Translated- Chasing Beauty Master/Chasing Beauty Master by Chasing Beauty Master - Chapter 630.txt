Guan Yu’s gaze remained fixed on Yi Yuan and Wei Fenggu, relentlessly assaulting them until they could no longer withstand her onslaught. Both were struck down, collapsing to the ground. She stared at them with hollow eyes, devoid of pity, her dark wings fluttering as she appeared before them, her expression chillingly blank.

Yi Yuan and Wei Fenggu finally understood the meaning of terror. They scrambled backward, seeking refuge, as the dread of death dawned on them. “Did those we killed feel this same fear?” Yi Yuan wondered bitterly. Now he realized that even the title of “Greatest Under Heaven” paled beside the value of life. But it was too late for remorse.

Slowly raising her left hand, Guan Yu summoned swirling orbs of dark energy that hovered obediently around her. With a flick of her wrist, the orbs shot toward Wei Fenggu. Panicking, he yanked a nearby Underworld Mountain soldier into their path, using him as a shield. The crowd recoiled in disgust—how could a Realm Sovereign-level expert stoop to such cowardice?

Yet in their condemnation, none considered their own potential frailty. How many would act differently under such duress? Wei Fenggu’s ploy failed catastrophically. Guan Yu’s attack tore through both the soldier and him, leaving their corpses lifeless, eyes wide with不甘.

Witnessing Wei Fenggu’s demise, Yi Yuan shut his eyes in resignation. Flight was his only option. Seizing an opening, he lunged at Hu Tianhe, grabbing him and fleeing. “Lion King, Bing Su, Ye Lingyun! Stop him!” The summoned trio exchanged grim smiles. If even a Realm Sovereign had fallen to Guan Yu, what hope had they?

Reluctantly, they obeyed, materializing before Guan Yu. The sheer pressure of her aura forced them to their knees, blood churning in their veins. As she moved to pursue Yi Yuan, her path was blocked by three Heavenly Sovereigns. With a casual wave, she encircled them with jagged blades of darkness. The trio closed their eyes, accepting retribution for their past sins—the same sins that had once cast Guan Yu into the abyss.

But just as despair gripped them, a voice cried out: “Stop, Griffon!” Guan Yu froze. The three turned to see Kong Lianxu staggering toward them, defying the suffocating death energy radiating from her. When Guan Yu turned her gaze upon him, the intensified aura nearly crushed him to the ground.

Kong Lianxu’s eyes burned with resolve. Though the Lion King and his allies had wronged Griffon, years of regret and covert aid under Hu Tianhe’s coercion had earned his mercy. He would not let Guan Yu kill them now.

Yet he failed to grasp that the Guan Yu before him was no longer conscious—only a vessel of slaughter. She attacked indiscriminately. A sudden strike sent Kong Lianxu flying, his face a mask of shock. Even Tian Huanyun stared in disbelief. Griffon would never harm Kong Lianxu… or so they had thought.

Murong Fengyu sensed something amiss. Studying Guan Yu, he noticed her crimson eyes—empty, lifeless, like a puppet’s. “Retreat! That’s not Wuer anymore!” he shouted. But Kong Lianxu’s heart ached. This was his failure—he had not protected her.

As the crowd reeled from one crisis to the next, Guan Yu soared skyward, her dark wings unfurled. She traced a circle in the air, summoning a vortex of shadow that hurtled toward Kong Lianxu. Murong Fengyu lunged, yanking him to safety moments before the vortex obliterated the ground where he’d stood.

The onlookers gaped at the crater—power rivaling a Realm Sovereign’s strike. Zhang Wuhen, momentarily entranced by the dark energy, snapped back when Murong Fengyu’s warning saved him. Guilt gnawed at Zhang: he had failed Guan Yu.

Before they could regroup, Guan Yu unleashed another assault—countless black blades, sharp as her wing-feathers, rained down. Screams filled the trial grounds as cultivators dodged or futilely resisted. Murong Fengyu darted behind Guan Yu, aiming to subdue her, but vanished. Agony seared his back as she reappeared, her hand dripping his blood.

She advanced, coalescing another dark orb. Murong closed his eyes, awaiting death… but it never came. Zhang Wuhen had thrown himself in the path, absorbing the attack. To everyone’s shock, the energy merged harmlessly with his core, catalyzing a breakthrough—Heavenly Sovereign, at just fifteen!

Guan Yu collapsed, wings dissolving. Zhang caught her mid-fall, cradling her gently. The crowd exhaled—safety, at last. Yet when Murong touched her arm, deathly energy surged anew. “She’s unharmed,” he lied, masking his unease. Why was Zhang unaffected?

“To the Demon Realm, now!” Murong ordered. Lingering risked Hu Tianhe’s retaliation. As they departed, deep within the Death Abyss, Hong Feng trembled with anticipation. At Realm Sovereign’s peak, he neared escape. “Soon, the Demon Sovereign Continent will be mine!”

Weeks passed in the Demon Realm. Guan Yu remained comatose, her body radiating lethal energy. Only Saints could approach—except Zhang Wuhen, who tended her daily, barring others under the guise of “rest.” Quarrels erupted until Murong mediated.

When Guan Yu finally stirred, disoriented and weak, Zhang rushed in—only to be pinned by her reflexive grapple. “Trying to murder your husband?” he quipped, rubbing his shoulder. “We have no such bond,” she coldly replied, noting the pallor of visitors recoiling from her aura.

Murong and others arrived, Tian Huanyun lingering outside. Guan Yu’s heart clenched—why wouldn’t her mother enter? Zhang, ever attentive, adjusted the light and fussed over her comfort, undeterred by her aloofness.

As the group reunited, Murong studied his son’s odd behavior—smiling by Guan Yu’s bedside, guarding her obsessively. What plagued him? Meanwhile, Hong Feng’s ambitions simmered, and Guan Yu’s awakening marked only the calm before a greater storm.

**Chapter 1603: Imprisonment**

For over a fortnight in the Demon Realm, Guan Yu lay unconscious, her body exuding a dread aura lethal to those below Saint Sovereign. Only Zhang Wuhen, inexplicably immune, attended her. He barred visitors, inciting tensions until Murong intervened.

When Guan Yu awoke, disoriented and frail, Zhang’s overzealous care clashed with her icy demeanor. Murong, perplexed by his son’s infatuation, noted her corrosive energy—why did it spare Zhang? As alliances strained and Hong Feng’s schemes loomed, Guan Yu’s true trial had only begun.
