Siki nodded and said, “That’s right. That thing wasn’t human at all—it was a demon, and I’m certain it was a fox demon.” No one dared believe such creatures truly existed. Xiao Zhi and Aze, having grown up in the Yunqing Sect, had never heard of such beings, nor had anyone ever warned them. This was their first encounter, and the mere thought sent shivers down their spines.

In their minds, demons and malevolent spirits were extraordinary existences. Such creatures possessed abilities to soar through skies and vanish into earth. If one wished to kill a person, that person would surely perish—there was no way to resist.

Xiao Zhi could scarcely believe it. “Impossible! How could such a thing exist within the Qin Manor?”

“I told you—the other night, I heard a fox’s cry. When I went outside, there was nothing. It must have been that creature. But speaking of it now… it’s truly terrifying. That fox demon must be extremely powerful?” Aze asked.

Guanyu knew nothing of such matters. Siki explained, “Correct. Generally, demons capable of shapeshifting into human form are immensely powerful. Consider this: an animal or plant must cultivate for countless years, accumulating centuries of cultivation before it can assume human guise. Such ancient beings are undoubtedly formidable.”

Guanyu added, “Steward Sun arrived last. Do you think the fox’s cry summoned him here?”

His words struck a chord. “Does that mean Steward Sun is colluding with the fox demon?” Xiao Zhi pondered before declaring, “This won’t do! If such a creature resides in Qin Manor, I’ll inform my aunt immediately and have this stinking fox hunted down!”

“Enough of your recklessness,” Guanyu interjected. “Use your head! As Siki said, that fox demon is powerful. It’s hidden here undetected for so long, conspiring with Steward Sun. Do you think it’ll be easily exposed? You’ll only alert them, endangering the entire manor. Stay quiet for now.”

**Chapter 3490: Lawless and Unrestrained**

“But we can’t let that demon remain here! It must have ulterior motives,” Xiao Zhi insisted stubbornly, though partially conceding to Guanyu’s logic.

“Of course it has motives! But knowing that changes nothing. We don’t know its true power. Alerting others now might get us killed,” Guanyu warned.

Aze nodded. “I agree with Guanyu. We mustn’t act rashly.”

The situation grew increasingly convoluted. Guanyu believed understanding the demon’s purpose within Qin Manor would unravel everything. Steward Sun clearly collaborated with the fox demon, which had already detected their suspicions. Any misstep now would prompt retaliation.

“What should we do then?” Xiao Zhi asked.

“Regardless, that fox demon must die,” Siki declared with unprecedented ferocity. “Even if it didn’t slaughter my family, it’s kin to those who did. I’ll never let it escape!”

Guanyu placated her, “Siki, I understand your thirst for vengeance, but we must first uncover their objectives.”

“Don’t worry—I’m no child. I won’t act foolishly.”

After further discussion, the group retreated to Guanyu’s chamber. “Until we eliminate that demon, we’ll stay together. After tonight’s exposure, Steward Sun will be wary. Everyone must remain vigilant.”

**Meanwhile, at Demon Soul Sect**

The Demon Lord emerged from seclusion, frustrated by stagnant cultivation progress. Spotting the Azure Dragon Left Envoy, he demanded, “Has Rong’er returned?”

“Not yet, my lord. In Qujiang City, I urged restraint, but the Young Mistress remains obstinate.”

“No matter. Didn’t she promise to bring Guanyu back?”

“Initially, yes. Now she vows to block him, claiming you harbor ill intentions toward him.”

“Outrageous! That girl grows ever more lawless!” the Demon Lord thundered. “Guanyu must be brought here—by any means necessary, but without harming him or souring his opinion. Understood?”

“Your will be done,” the envoy bowed, understanding the delicate balance between the Demon Lord’s ambitions and his daughter’s temper.

**Chapter 3491: Investigation**

“What of Meng Hua Ancestor’s legacy?” the Demon Lord inquired.

“We’ve located Duobao Mountain’s hidden entrance. Our forces are ready to breach it discreetly.”

“Excellent. Let those fools keep searching the mountain while we claim the Eight-Sided Drum Technique!” The Demon Lord laughed triumphantly.

“Additionally, Qujiang’s authorities have been arresting Red Lotus Sect members near Duobao Mountain. Should we ally with them?”

“Handle it as you see fit. Our priority remains Meng Hua’s legacy.”

**Back at Qin Manor**

At dawn, chaos erupted. Guanyu discovered sixteen guards and two maids slaughtered—some with triple claw marks, others with snapped necks. Examining a red fur strand, Siki gasped, “Fox fur!”

“The demon felt exposed and struck!” she concluded. “It abandoned the bodies rather than feeding—proof of its haste.”

Guanyu concurred. “Claw marks match a fox demon. The broken necks suggest tail attacks. We’re dealing with the same creature from last night.”

Panicked, Xiao Zhi rushed to check on his cousin Qin Tàijīn. They found the heir swathed in bandages, attended by Lady Qin who dismissed the killings as “mere assassins already fled.”

**Chapter 3492: Sinister Intentions**

“Aunt, shouldn’t we hunt the killers?” Xiao Zhi pressed.

“My son’s recovery takes precedence,” Lady Qin replied, doting on her motionless heir. When Steward Sun reported no leads, she sighed, “Twenty peaceful years, yet trouble arises when my husband travels...”

Guanyu noted the matriarch’s willful blindness. As they departed, he whispered, “That fox demon’s purpose here runs deep. We’ll uncover it ourselves.”
