Chapter 3819: The Escape

In the end, even Guan Yu had betrayed them. This matter pained Xuanming most deeply. If Guan Yu were to join the Demonic Soul Sect, it would bring catastrophic losses to the Cloud Azure Sect. As a dual cultivator of both orthodox and demonic arts, should the Demon Lord nurture him to full power, the consequences would be unimaginable. When that day came, it would herald the Cloud Azure Sect's greatest calamity.

Elder Lu spoke: "Sect Master, this matter isn't absolute. Recall that when Guan Yu went to Qujiang City earlier, he claimed not to have found the Eight-Sided Drum Technique in Patriarch Menghua's underground palace, only a clue. Later we learned the Demonic Soul Sect had seized it first—the technique now rests in the Demon Lord's hands."

"When Guan Yu returned, we examined him with the spirit beast scales. At that time, no abnormalities were detected. Had the Eight-Sided Drum Technique been within him then, the scales couldn't have erred."

"As for Yan Zhao's claims—they might not be truthful. Perhaps Guan Yu saw through his disguise, prompting this false accusation. Moreover, I believe Guan Yu will return. He has no reason to join the Demonic Soul Sect."

Xuanming found this reasoning sound. Of course, he hoped Guan Yu would return untainted. This dual cultivator would then remain a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect. Xuanming even considered that upon Guan Yu's return, he'd never send him on missions again—keeping him sheltered within the sect until fully matured.

However, after Yan Zhao's recent return, Xuanming had secretly spoken with him. Before descending the mountain, Xuanming had given Yan Zhao the Millennium Peach Wood and specific instructions. Yet Yan Zhao insisted the Eight-Sided Drum Technique resided within Guan Yu, claiming multiple failed attempts to retrieve it.

The truth remained unclear. Perhaps Elder Lu was right—they'd need to await Guan Yu's return for answers.

Two disciples from Tiger Head Peak's rear courtyard approached Elder Lu, whispering in his ear before retreating. They'd been searching for Yan Zhao but found no trace.

Elder Lu reported: "Sect Master, the disciples confirm they've searched every room in Tiger Head Peak's rear courtyard. Yan Zhao appears to have fled the Cloud Azure Sect."

Escape would be effortless now. With all disciples gathered here, only Wang Jun at Bamboo Forest Peak and the imprisoned Xiao Zhi remained elsewhere. Elder Jiu and mute Xiao Dong guarded the back mountains, with a few other elders stationed at high peaks. All other areas stood empty.

Xuanming waved dismissively. "We'll address that later. Proceed with today's tasks. All Elders shall follow this list to examine disciples. Though scarce, I'll distribute the spirit beast scales now."

"Elder Dai receives one scale, Elder Zheng the other. Begin inspecting disciples from Bamboo Forest Peak and Left Void Peak. Other Elders supervise—no leniency permitted. Rotate examiners afterward."

Chapter 3820: Severe Injury

The assembly stirred with surprise. Xuanming had given a scale to Elder Zheng—still under surveillance and stripped of real authority. Was this forgiveness? Had Xiao Zhi's matter been settled?

Elder Lu understood. By entrusting Zheng, Xuanming both restored his standing and signaled temporary trust. Moreover, Zheng's hatred for traitors after his son's misfortune ensured rigorous inspections.

As twilight approached, examinations revealed no issues—a small comfort. Xuanming declared: "Continue through the night. Cleared disciples may leave. Others await inspection."

Disciples now clamored to be examined first, eager to depart rather than wait until midnight.

"Finally back to Cloud Azure Sect," Guan Yu murmured. Spotting movement to his right, he recognized Yan Zhao and spurred his horse forward. "Today I'll avenge Xiao Zhi!"

Yan Zhao had hesitated before fleeing, gambling that spirit scales mightn't detect his blood poison. Remembering Guan Yu's undetected technique, he finally chose survival—seeking refuge with the Demonic Soul Sect.

Seeing Guan Yu approach, Yan Zhao's hatred flared. "Perfect timing! I'll claim your Eight-Sided Drum Technique for the Demon Lord's favor!"

Guan Yu leapt from his saddle, Soulfall Blade pointed. "Traitor! Today you pay for Xiao Zhi's suffering!"

Their clash erupted instantly. Though Yan Zhao's decades of cultivation made him formidable, Guan Yu's overwhelming strength and speed pressed him relentlessly.

"Your head will cleanse Xiao Zhi's name!" Guan Yu roared.

Realizing disadvantage, Yan Zhao summoned a flying sword to escape. Guan Yu's Desert Eagle spat fire—a bullet shattered Yan Zhao's left ankle mid-flight.

"Howling in pain, Yan Zhao barely maintained flight. Guan Yu watched his retreat, knowing pursuit proved futile.

Chapter 3821: Hear Your Explanation

Returning to Cloud Azure Sect, Guan Yu found Front Return Peak deserted. Reaching Tiger Head Peak's courtyard, he discovered ongoing inspections. Only Elder Xiang showed anxiety.

Thus far, only Left Void Peak disciple Qu Ze had been exposed—bearing blood poison. Enraged, Xuanming kicked the traitor unconscious before publicly rebuking Elder Xiang. The humiliated elder offered no defense, his earlier harsh judgment of Xiao Zhi now haunting him.
