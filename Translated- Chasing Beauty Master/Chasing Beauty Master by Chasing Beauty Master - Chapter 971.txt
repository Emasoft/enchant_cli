At this moment, it was time to prove oneself before the boss. Women were like livestock - they needed regular discipline, otherwise over time these beasts would grow insolent and disobedient.

Xie Yulu immediately became more compliant. Jia Bo thought with satisfaction that masculine dignity was finally being restored. To further demonstrate dominance, he viciously shouted at Xie Yulu: "Get out right now! Don't linger here getting in the way. We're discussing serious matters - what business does a woman have meddling in this?"

With tear-streaked face, Xie Yulu turned and fled. Jia Bo straightened his collar smugly, savoring today's triumph. "Damn shrew," he muttered under his breath. "Think I can't control you just because I've been lenient..."

Guan Yu secretly chuckled while maintaining a neutral expression. Truth be told, it was remarkable how Jia Bo managed to control a girl like Xie Yulu from such a privileged family. Perhaps these two might actually have a future together.

Lion King raised his thumb admiringly. "Brother Jia's truly formidable! Scolding that woman into silence - now that's real manhood! So domineering! So inspiring!"

"What nonsense are you spouting?" snapped the short-haired girl beside him, twisting his ear viciously. "Admiring him, are you? Want to imitate that behavior? Think I'm some pushover? Seems you need regular beatings to stay in line!" She punctuated her words with sharp kicks.

Wincing in pain with half his face flushed red, Lion King pleaded: "I was wrong, wife! Just complimenting others, no need for anger! So many people watching - save some face for me!"

"To hell with your face! Men want dignity, but women don't? Listen well - if you harbor any rebellious thoughts, I'll kick your worthless balls into paste!" With a final savage twist, she released his ear.

As Lion King rubbed his throbbing ear, Jia Bo chuckled. "Our Lion King endures quite the domestic storms, eh?"

Amidst the laughter, Guan Yu stood. "Enough for today. I'll take my leave now. Ensure my instructions are carried out properly."

"Understood, boss. It'll be done," Jia Bo affirmed.

Passing Lion King, Guan Yu remarked with amusement, "Brother, being managed by a woman can be its own form of happiness."

After Guan Yu departed, Lion King puzzled: "Brother Jia, what did the boss mean? Was he mocking me?"

"Quit overthinking! Take your woman home already. Remember to lay low recently - avoid being noticed." Jia Bo patted Lion King's shoulder.

Lion King nodded resentfully, shooting a glare at his companion. "Understood. We'll take our leave."

On the road home, Xue Jing suggested: "Guan Yu, this Cheng Ye targeting you is clearly using false identities. Why not ask Conghan for help? The Yang family's city-wide network could easily uncover clues."

Guan Yu shook his head. "Unnecessary. I won't exploit Yang family resources unless critical. Their prominence makes them vulnerable - minor conflicts could ripple through their numerous enterprises."

Xue Jing nodded understandingly. The Yang family's vast commercial empire spanning multiple provinces indeed risked sabotage from petty grudges.

Over subsequent days, Yu Gang members operated discreetly under Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo's direction.

One evening at a modest seafood restaurant on Kaihuang Street's midsection, two brothers drank at a back table. Fan Shuicai, the elder brother, slurred drunkenly: "Those Yu Gang bastards went too far! Stealing sworn brothers' women! But don't worry - I'll find chance to teach them!"

Younger brother Fan Shuiyun gloomily stared at his drink. "Their power's overwhelming. Better drop this."

"Drop it? Where's your manhood? Letting them take your woman? I'll never accept this!" Shuicai roared.

"But how can we oppose them?"

"Fucking Yu Gang crosses all lines! If opportunity comes, we'll knife those bastards in the dark!"

Shuiyun nervously glanced around. "Quiet! This is Yu Gang territory! Their people frequent here!"

"Fucking coward! Let them shit on us? Better die fighting!" Shuicai's ranting infected his brother.

Emboldened by alcohol, Shuiyun slammed his cup. "You're right! Nothing left to lose! Let's settle accounts!"

"Exactly! Tonight we stalk their members - ambush them in alleys! Many recently got hospitalized from sneak attacks. We'll do same!"

Clutching beer bottles, the intoxicated brothers staggered out. Outside a budget bar, bouncers blocked them. "Purpose here?"

"Fuck off! Here to party!" Shuicai brandished his bottle.

"Leave those outside."

After discarding bottles, they tried entering but got stopped again. "Troublemakers aren't welcome."

Shuicai erupted: "Fuck your mother! Threw bottles already! You looking down on us?"

A masked man in black suit approached calmly. "Brothers seem troubled. Perhaps I can assist?"

Shuiyun whispered: "We've nothing worth scamming. Hear him out."

The masked man led them to an alley. "I know you target Yu Gang. As their enemy, let's collaborate."

Shuicai brightened. "You'll help us? Teach those woman-stealing dogs a lesson?"

"Brute force fails. We need strategy." The man produced an envelope. "Here's Yu Gang member lists and hangouts. Includes 10,000 yuan for expenses. Succeed, and more rewards follow. Call me Cheng Ye."

As the brothers examined cash, their laughter froze Cheng Ye's retreat. "Fool! You walked right into Yu Gang's trap!"

Suddenly, moonlight revealed converging crowds. A weighted net dropped, ensnaring Cheng Ye. Shuicai pressed a machete to his throat. "Move, and test your neck against steel."

Trapped and surrounded, Cheng Ye ceased struggling. The brothers' drunken personas evaporated. "Thought you could buy allies against us? Now you'll answer for every attack on our members."

The net tightened as Yu Gang enforcers emerged from shadows. Guan Yu stepped forward, cold satisfaction in his eyes. "At last we meet, Cheng Ye. Let's discuss your... grievances properly."
