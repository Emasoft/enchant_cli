Wen Qing seemed oblivious to Guan Yu's discomfort, leaning even closer until not only her chest pressed against him, but her shapely legs clad in tight jeans also made direct contact with his thighs.

“Husband… is that okay? I’ll definitely be obedient. Let me serve you properly, alright?”

Guan Yu sniffled, staring at her pleadingly. “Alright… I agree. Please don’t do this. Someone might see us.”

“You agreed? Husband, you’re the best!” Wen Qing exclaimed joyfully, hugging his head and planting a loud kiss on his lips.

Overwhelmed by her fervor, Guan Yu broke into an awkward, sweaty smile.

When they returned to the classroom, Zhao Jing’er lay slumped over her desk, lost in thought.

“Brother, you’re back. Sister-in-law…” As Guan Yu sat beside her, Zhao Jing’er quickly straightened up, greeting him and Wen Qing demurely.

“What’s on our Jing’er’s mind? Which boy has stolen your heart?”

Blushing, Zhao Jing’er cast a furtive glance at Guan Yu before lowering her head to her book without a word.

True to Wen Qing’s word, she spent the final study period packing two large suitcases of clothes at her dormitory. She calmly waited by the school gate, in no hurry as she anticipated Guan Yu’s arrival.

When Guan Yu approached the gate with Niu Le and Zhao Jing’er, his head throbbed with dread. How had he foolishly agreed to this? If Feng Xin arrived to pick them up later, the situation would likely explode…

“I’ll call Luo Cheng to drive us,” Guan Yu muttered, unwilling to face a public meltdown. Reluctantly, he dialed his sworn brother.

Twenty minutes later, Wen Qing and Zhao Jing’er departed in Luo Cheng’s car, leaving Guan Yu and Niu Le waiting for Du Xiaojuan.

“Big Bro, are you really taking Wen Qing, the campus belle, home? Can you handle so many women?” Niu Le asked skeptically.

“What choice do I have?” Guan Yu grumbled, scratching his head.

“Even renting another place to hide them separately would be better than cramming them together! Will there ever be peace? Won’t they tear the house apart?” Niu Le groaned, pitying his friend.

Guan Yu sighed deeply. “They’ll… work it out. There has to be a way.” The tangled relationships left no easy solutions—either he made a choice, or one of the women would eventually leave in frustration. Neither outcome appealed to him.

After ten more minutes with no sign of Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu frowned and dialed her number.

*The number you have dialed is powered off.*

Panic crept in. Where was she? Du Xiaojuan always waited eagerly by the gate like a homing pigeon. Why hadn’t she appeared today?

“Wait here,” Guan Yu ordered Niu Le, striding back toward Du Xiaojuan’s classroom. He quickened his pace, eventually taking the stairs two at a time.

Peering into her empty classroom, he found only two couples whispering intimately in the back.

“Not here…” He sighed, redialing her number fruitlessly before rushing to the girls’ dormitory.

The middle-aged dorm matron eyed him suspiciously. “What do you want?”

“Auntie, could you tell me which room Du Xiaojuan is in?” Guan Yu asked politely.

“Ask someone else,” she snapped, shooing him away.

Defeated, Guan Yu glanced upstairs. Bursting in blindly risked encountering… compromising situations.

As he hesitated, Fu Lili appeared at a second-floor window, glaring daggers at him.

“Is Du Xiaojuan here?” Guan Yu called up.

Fu Lili’s face darkened. “No idea!” She stormed off, slamming the window.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu cursed his past self for ever being infatuated with her. If Du Xiaojuan wasn’t here, where else—

His phone rang. Fu Lili’s name flashed on the screen.

“Du Xiaojuan left after two classes. Did you two fight?” Her voice carried unexpected concern.

“Thanks.” Guan Yu hung up without elaboration.

Returning to the gate, he lit a cigarette beneath a sapling. Hours passed. The streetlights flickered on, their colorful glow lost on him.

“Let’s check her aunt’s place,” he finally ordered Luo Cheng.

The dark, empty apartment confirmed his fears. Guan Yu slammed a fist against the wall. Where was that silly girl? Didn’t she know he needed her—her morning toothpaste ritual, her clinging warmth at night?

“Contact every underworld connection. Check human traffickers, rich brats who might’ve taken her—anything!” His voice cracked.

As Luo Cheng mobilized their network, Guan Yu stared at the starry sky, hollowed by dread.

*When I find you, I’m spanking you senseless,* he vowed silently.

**Chapter 326: I Need to Find Her**

The cold wind bit through Guan Yu’s jacket as Luo Cheng draped a coat over his shoulders. “Everyone’s looking.”

“Let’s go back,” Guan Yu murmured hoarsely.

At Luo Cheng’s hotel, a snarky gang member drawled, “Finding someone in this city’s like searching for a corpse—”

“Enough!” Luo Cheng barked, cutting him off.

Guan Yu’s knuckles whitened, but he remained silent. These lowlifes were his only hope.

**Chapter 327: Come Home, I’m Waiting**

The night deepened. Guan Yu chain-smoked, each drag fueling his torment. How had his life become this tangled web?

Memories flooded him—Du Xiaojuan’s timid grip on his sleeve that afternoon, her plea to go home. He’d failed her.

“Eat something,” he forced out, though his own stomach churned.

When crude jokes erupted from newly arrived thugs, Luo Cheng swiftly dispatched them. Guan Yu stared blankly at his cold tea, the cheerful restaurant music grating against his despair.

Somewhere out there, his foolish girl wandered alone. And he’d move heaven and earth to bring her back.
