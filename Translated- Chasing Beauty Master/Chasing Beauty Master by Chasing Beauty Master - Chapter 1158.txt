“I truly never expected that Bill Lin would actually wash his hands of this. Ten million isn't substantial for him, but it's genuinely difficult for you,” Guan Yu said, shifting his gaze to Luo Bo before continuing, “Bill Lin may lack funds, but this chief bodyguard of the Bill Family should have money, no? I believe the annual service fees the Bill Family pays you amount to astronomical figures. Couldn't you help this woman before us produce ten million to redeem the hostage?”

Guan Yu spoke truthfully. In reality, Luo Bo was a tycoon - the rare conservative type who never revealed his wealth. Known for his extreme stinginess, the Feng Family paid him tens of millions annually, sometimes even exceeding a hundred million, not counting other expenses and daily expenditures.

Luo Bo's savings likely totaled hundreds of millions. Even accounting for his frequent high-stakes gambling, it was improbable he'd squandered everything. At Guan Yu's reminder, Poison Widow realized the validity of his argument.

Luo Bo should indeed be a financial powerhouse. With urgent need to ransom someone, if Luo Bo provided ten million, wouldn't Xiang Jiamian be saved without requiring conflict with Guan Yu?

Poison Widow's beseeching gaze turned to Luo Bo. The miserly bodyguard nearly choked on fury at Guan Yu exposing his wealth publicly. Under Poison Widow's expectant stare, he couldn't refuse outright without appearing utterly unreasonable. “Suppose I could fund Xiang Jiamian's ransom,” Luo Bo addressed Guan Yu, “Though moderately affluent, I'm no Bill Lin. Let's negotiate reasonably - if I pay the ransom, shouldn't you offer a bearable price?”

Guan Yu chuckled derisively. “Mr. Luo Bo, today's matter isn't market haggling. Do you expect me to give discounts?”

“While not market bargaining, demanding ten million upfront is impossible. I repeat - I lack Bill Lin's resources. Keeping this dying man benefits you nothing. If we depart now, you'll receive zero compensation.” Though Luo Bo's words sounded logical, Guan Yu detected their cunning precision.

“Very well. I know ten million means little to you, but acknowledging your sincerity, I'll reduce two million. Eight million suffices. Pay promptly and take Xiang Jiamian to hospital before it's too late.”

Guan Yu pressed, knowing the reduction wouldn't satisfy the parsimonious Luo Bo. True to form, Luo Bo countered, “A mere two million reduction from such a prominent figure? Let's settle at six million. I'll withdraw peacefully and avoid future conflicts.”

Though tempted by the non-aggression promise, Guan Yu knew such vows meant nothing unless they abandoned Bill Lin's employ. “You were top assassin in a global organization! After years serving the Bill Family, your wealth must be immense. Will you haggle over two million? Eight million is final. Only respect for your status earned this concession.”

Poison Widow anxiously awaited Luo Bo's decision, desperate to save Xiang Jiamian whom she'd recruited. The bodyguard shook his head. “It's not unwillingness, but liquidity issues. The Bill Family pays through overseas accounts. My domestic funds can't cover this sum.”

Hoping to stall until reinforcements arrived, Guan Yu continued, “My true aim isn't money but opposing Bill Lin. The Fengs and I are sworn enemies. As Bill Lin backs them, we'll never reconcile.”

Suddenly, commotion erupted outside. The club flooded with Feng Family bodyguards - an unexpected escalation. Instead of negotiating, Bill Lin had sent troops. Guan Yu urgently ordered, “Take defensive positions!”

As Xue Jing escorted Guan Yu upstairs, Hou Jinshun and Shen Sheng guarded below. Poison Widow finally tended to Xiang Jiamian, preparing his hospital transfer. Guan Yu couldn't interfere - the first floor now swarmed with enemies.

Noticing Wolf's Second's absence, Luo Bo challenged, “Guan Yu! Where's my true rival Wolf's Second? These minions aren't worth my effort. Summon him!”

With battle imminent and Wolf's Second absent, Guan Yu's forces faced disaster. Xue Jing engaged Poison Widow on the stairs while Shen Sheng and Xiao Bai intercepted Luo Bo. Hou Jinshun's trio barely held the stairwell against the human tide.

Guan Yu watched anxiously from above. Xue Jing matched Poison Widow, while Luo Bo's distracted defense against Wolf's Second's potential ambush allowed Shen Sheng's team temporary resistance. The critical point remained Hou Jinshun's position - three men against dozens.

Guan Yu fired a warning shot ceiling-ward. “Bang!” The crowd froze. “My bullets won't discriminate!” Guan Yu coldly declared. “One stray shot among this crowd...”

Poison Widow hesitated - firearms changed everything. Feng guards began retreating. Luo Bo calculated the fifteen-meter distance to Guan Yu. Though confident in closing the gap swiftly, he feared Guan Yu's trigger reflex.

When a Feng captain returned fire, the bullet narrowly missing Guan Yu, chaos erupted. Seizing the distraction, Luo Bo lunged at Guan Yu. Xue Jing's warning came too late - the assassin's claws inches from Guan Yu's throat when crimson light flashed.

Luo Bo recoiled, fingertip severed. Wolf's Second materialized beside Guan Yu, blade gleaming. “Shameful ambushing an elder!” the warrior mocked. “Let's duel properly elsewhere.”

“We've achieved our objective!” Luo Bo backpedaled, signaling retreat. “Another day!” As Poison Widow's forces withdrew, Wolf's Second snorted at the fleeing figures. “All bark, no bite. Pathetic.”

Guan Yu exhaled in relief. The delayed reinforcements had arrived just in time.
