“I don’t know if my choice is right. He belongs to so many people—who knows how much will remain when it’s my turn? But fate arranged by heaven brought us together. If I don’t choose him, I wonder if I’ll ever seek another man in this lifetime. More than that, I don’t know if I’ll ever meet anyone who could compare to him.”

Lin Qiaoqiao lowered her head and turned to enter the house. No amount of words could express her current mood. The moment she watched Guan Yu disappear into the distance, it felt as if her entire being had been hollowed out.

It was as though a viscous current clung to Guan Yu’s figure, dragging Qiaoqiao’s heart away and leaving behind nothing but an empty shell.

Lin Zhonggeng shook his head helplessly. It was clear his daughter had fallen too deeply. No amount of persuasion would make much difference now. She would have to find her own way out—or remain trapped forever.

By the time Guan Yu and his group rushed back to the Yunqing Sect, night had long fallen. They had traveled without rest. At the mountain’s base, Siqi flew up with Guan Yu, while Second Only to Wolf followed closely using his lightness skill.

Upon arrival, Second Only to Wolf—perhaps deeming Guan Yu safe here—announced he would retire to his room to sleep.

Siqi added, “Now that Guan Yu has been safely returned, I must report to Convergence Peak and inform Master. I’ll take my leave.”

Guan Yu quickly interjected, “Sister Siqi, I still need you to escort me to the back mountain. Without you, I’ll lose my way. After all, I can’t fly on my own yet.”

Siqi felt as though she had become Guan Yu’s perpetual guide, obliged to accompany him everywhere. Though she didn’t resent it, she hardly wished to continue indefinitely. Still, she reasoned that once Guan Yu mastered basic cultivation and sword flight, he could travel independently.

Elder Lu suggested, “Guan Yu, night is deep. Why don’t you and your friend stay at Front Return Peak tonight and depart tomorrow?”

Guan Yu, considering Siqi’s fatigue from the journey, nodded. “Very well. I propose Sister Siqi also stays at Front Return Peak tonight. She can report to Aunt Dai tomorrow.”

“No,” Siqi refused. “I must return to inform Master immediately. Now that we’re back at Yunqing Sect, it’s improper to linger here overnight.”

Her tone had turned frosty since their return, laced with the rigid formality of classical scholars.

Guan Yu conceded the point—a woman staying overnight here would indeed raise eyebrows. Yet he longed to spend more time with Siqi. Their trip had offered no moments of privacy.

“Then let me accompany you to Convergence Peak,” he offered cheerfully. “I’d like to pay my respects to Aunt Dai as well.”

His transparent desire to follow Siqi drew no objections. The pair’s striking looks rendered any interference unreasonable.

Elder Lu cared little for Guan Yu’s whereabouts. His sole concern was Second Only to Wolf remaining at Front Return Peak. As long as that held, others could come and go as they pleased.

Feigning reluctance, Elder Lu said, “Ah, Guan Yu, you really ought to stay at Front Return Peak awhile. Let this old host fulfill his duties!”

Guan Yu ignored the sarcasm beneath the man’s fleshy smile. “Thank you for your hospitality, Elder Lu, but I’ll go with Sister Siqi. This way, she can take me to the back mountain at dawn without needing to fetch me tomorrow. I also wish to thank Aunt Dai for aiding my friend.”

Before Guan Yu finished speaking, Elder Lu hastily agreed. “Then go! Make haste—it’s late.”

Shooting the elder a disdainful glance, Guan Yu shook his head and left with Siqi. As they flew, he asked, “Sister Siqi, why has Aunt Dai’s attitude toward us shifted? Do you know the reason?”

“How would I know Master’s affairs?” Siqi replied. “As disciples, we don’t pry.”

**Chapter 3,212: Commotion**

Siqi’s rigid propriety likely stemmed from years under Dai Shouzhuo’s stern tutelage, steeped in doctrines of obedience.

At Convergence Peak, Dai Shouzhuo greeted Guan Yu with uncharacteristic warmth. “Guan Yu, you’ve returned. Did Second Brother not join you?”

Surprised she inquired about Second Only to Wolf before even asking after Siqi or his friend’s health, Guan Yu smiled faintly. “He’s resting at Front Return Peak. He intended to pay respects, but the journey wearied him.”

“Of course! He must rest. I’ll visit him at Front Return Peak later,” Dai replied brightly.

Guan Yu observed her unusual courtesy. Two possibilities arose: either she fancied Second Only to Wolf or sought to recruit him as a guardian. The latter seemed unlikely—Second Only to Wolf’s pride as a top assassin earning billions precluded subservience to an elder unless swayed by extraordinary incentives... perhaps a woman. Yet Guan Yu knew only Sakurako could compel such loyalty.

He opted to let events unfold.

Dai asked, “Will you proceed to the back mountain tonight or rest here?”

Glancing at Siqi, Guan Yu said, “The journey tired me. I’ll stay tonight and depart at dawn.”

Dai approved, though accommodating a male guest posed challenges—Convergence Peak lacked male quarters. After much deliberation, they cleared a room among the female disciples’ lodgings.

That evening, disciples gathered in a rear courtyard, chatting idly. Guan Yu’s arrival sparked intense interest—many rarely encountered men. Some boldly approached.

“A handsome youth! Is he tonight’s dessert?” one called unabashedly.

Xiaochun and Xiaolian led Guan Yu stone-faced through the crowd. He smiled politely, sending some into raptures.

“Ah! Did he glance at me? I’m melting!” a disciple swooned.

Guan Yu realized the peril of this female-dominated environment. Any male intruder risked exhaustion.

Reaching his room, Xiaochun warned, “Rest here tonight. Do not wander—it’s improper among female disciples.”

Guan Yu agreed, though the setting tempted mischief. A man living here could father a dynasty... and perish from exertion.

As Xiaochun and Xiaolian departed, a disciple accosted him. “Handsome, why are you here? Did Master recruit you?”

“I’m from Tiger Head Peak, not Convergence,” he replied.

Once alone, Guan Yu found himself besieged. Questions and propositions flew until he retreated inside, ignoring persistent knocking and lurid offers. The disciples’ desperation spoke volumes about Dai’s strict regime.

Silence finally descended, and Guan Yu slept deeply—until midnight, when a figure slid a drugged pipe through his window. The door clicked open, revealing a white-robed woman: Shi Zhen, a disciple smitten since their earlier encounter.

She locked the door, crept toward his bed, and lunged—just as shouts erupted outside: “Thief! Catch the thief!”
