These bodyguards were mere cannon fodder, sent to clear the path for those behind. Their mission would be complete once the main gate was breached. But we absolutely cannot allow them to open this temple gate.

The overwhelming numbers outside posed a real threat. If that gate were forced open and the horde surged through, Guan Yu would truly face dire consequences today.

Xue Jing's brick-throwing accuracy proved lethally precise, deterring many guards from scaling the walls as they cowered below. Still, over a dozen had already leapt into the courtyard and were rushing toward the gate's position.

Guan Yu remained composed. These ordinary guards lacked any cultivation base. Even if they reached the gate, breaching it would take time. Earlier, before Young Master Feng's arrival, they'd reinforced the gate with iron nails securing the crossbar. These commoners would need tools to dismantle it.

Xue Jing's silhouette flickered through the air with ethereal grace, momentarily stunning the intruding guards. In the next heartbeat, they collapsed unconscious. A dozen men proved no match - she felled each with a single strike, her ruthless kicks strategically aimed at vulnerable regions.

Witnessing this carnage, the remaining guards abandoned their wall-scaling attempts. Xue Jing swiftly joined Shen Sheng's group in battling Ha Da. Though Ha Da neared First-Class尊者 (Venerable) strength, even three coordinated attackers struggled against him. But with Xue Jing's icy aura shifting the tide, Guan Yu estimated Ha Da's defeat was imminent.

Wei Hongwei busied himself collecting fallen bricks for reuse while Guan Yu observed the courtyard. The bearded monk faced dire straits against Ha Er's whirlwind staff strikes, barely parrying blows that could shatter bones with a single hit.

"Xiao Bai!" Guan Yu commanded. "Assist the bearded one! Take down Ha Er swiftly through combined force."

Xiao Bai disengaged, joining the fray. Though still outmatched in raw power, their coordinated attacks created openings. The bearded monk absorbed heavy strikes while Xiao Bai's dagger flashed like an enraged hornet, infuriating Ha Er who redirected fury toward his nimble tormentor.

Chapter 2590: Relief

Xiao Bai's agility created opportunities. While Ha Er chased him, the bearded monk's iron staff found purchase. A dagger slash opened Ha Er's back, though his obsidian muscles barely registered the wound. Blood streamed down his torso as combat raged - neither side gaining clear advantage.

Meanwhile, Jia Bo mobilized over two hundred Yu Gang members. Vehicle shortages forced分批 (staggered deployment). "Move out with what we have!" Jia Bo ordered. "Wang Hu, gather more transport."

Simultaneously, Bill Young Master deployed roadblocks on the mountain approach - caltrops scattered, trucks blocking the path. His convoy ascended while sabotaging the winding 15km route, ensuring any relief force would arrive exhausted.

Back at the temple, Ha Da finally retreated under combined assault, coughing blood as he vaulted the wall. "Ha Er! Retrieve Third Brother and withdraw!"

As Ha Er grabbed the unconscious Ha San, Xue Jing's brick found its mark - a resounding crack against his skull. "Surviving that makes you lucky," she smirked, brushing dust from her hands.

Guan Yu shook his head at her newfound brick-hurling enthusiasm. The immediate threat neutralized, the group regrouped at the pavilion. The bearded monk gulped water, chest heaving. "That brute's strength... without Xiao Bai..."

Guan Yu raised a cup solemnly. "Today's debt I won't forget. To brotherhood!"

Outside, Bill Young Master surveyed his battered elites. Ha Da shook his head: "Seven inside - four monks with seamless coordination. That girl... her glacial qi chills the soul."

Ha Er spat blood, cursing Xiao Bai's dagger work. Bill's medical team tended wounds while he grimaced - Guan Yu's resilience exceeded expectations.

Feng Young Master wrung his hands. "I warned you! Now what?"

"Save your bleating," Bill snapped. "We're not done yet."

Chapter 2591: No Easy Victory

Feng recoiled at Bill's scathing tone. "We tried scaling walls repeatedly! Their brick barrage..." He gestured at blood-smeared rubble and moaning wounded encircling the compound.

Bill's gaze swept the crimson perimeter before hardening. "How many inside?"

"Six or seven," a guard captain reported. "Your elites are outmatched."

Within the courtyard, the regrouped defenders drank deeply. Shen Sheng clasped Guan Yu's shoulder. "Brothers share adversity. We stand together."

The bearded monk grinned through his beard. "Any friend of Wei's is ours!"

Their camaraderie contrasted sharply with the tension beyond the walls. As medics treated Ha Er's wounds, Bill's mind raced - alternative strategies, hidden cards to play. This chess match was far from checkmate.
