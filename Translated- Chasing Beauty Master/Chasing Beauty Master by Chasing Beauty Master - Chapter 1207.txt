His magical weapon turned out to be a folding fan. When opened and raised above his head, his left hand swiftly formed several hand seals before his chest.

At this moment, Jinciyu Lang gripped his longsword with both hands, crimson battle aura blazing as he swung downward with tremendous force!

What seemed like an unavoidable strike instead met empty air as his opponent vanished without trace.

"Wind spell practitioners excel at speed!" Jinciyu Lang roared, "I won't let you escape!"

While others failed to see Younger Martial Brother Miao's escape route, Jinciyu Lang immediately gave chase, refusing to let the distance widen.

Younger Martial Brother Miao cursed inwardly. This seemingly ordinary man had revealed terrifying combat prowess, forcing him into constant evasion without any chance to cast spells.

Guanyu shouted: "Let these so-called immortals learn not to look down on others!"

Realizing solitary combat meant certain defeat, Younger Martial Brother Miao desperately rummaged through his robes. He produced a small orb - an emergency signal to summon sect assistance. Crushing it would alert his masters to his location.

Without hesitation, he shattered the sphere. On Cloudclear Mountain, a disciple rushed into the main hall: "Master! Junior Brother Miao has sent a distress signal from the foothills!"

A dignified figure in vermilion Taoist robes seated at the hall's apex remarked calmly: "Interesting. Could the villagers be causing trouble? Xiao Jin, accompany Senior Brother Ma Xiao. Assist your junior brother in apprehending the troublemakers. We'll detain them until matters settle."

The pursuers became the pursued as Jinciyu Lang's relentless assault left Younger Martial Brother Miao's robes in tatters, a bloody gash across his waist.

Reinforcements soon arrived. Xiao Jin shouted: "Audacious fools! Dare attack Cloudclear Sect disciples?"

Twin elemental assaults - wind and fire - converged on Jinciyu Lang, tipping the battle to three against one. Guanyu warned: "Behind you, Brother Jinci! These righteous sects only know ambush tactics!"

Chapter 3098: He's Deaf

Guanyu joined the fray but found himself outmatched. Xiao Jin's speed doubled his own, rendering counterattacks futile. The tide turned completely as spell bombardments forced Jinciyu Lang into constant evasion.

"Master instructed apprehension, not slaughter," Xiao Jin declared. Using wind magic, Younger Martial Brother Miao captured Guanyu while Ma Xiao subdued the battered Jinciyu Lang.

Lin Qiaoqiao screamed as her family was swept up in the vortex: "Release them!" Even little Xiaozhu playing outside got caught in the gale, carried skyward to Cloudclear Mountain.

Villagers murmured in panic below. The aged village chief dismissed crowds: "Return home! Speak no more of this matter."

In the mountain hall, Xiao Jin reported: "Master, we've brought the troublemakers. One injured Junior Brother Miao - a martial expert."

The wounded disciple hung his head: "Forgive this useless disciple..."

"Tend your wounds," the Master waved. His gaze then fell on Guanyu's group inspecting their surroundings - the grand hall perched atop clouds, its architecture reminiscent of ancient swordplay dramas.

"Unharmed?" Guanyu asked Jinciyu Lang, who snorted: "Three against one? No shame in this outcome."

Lin Qiaoqiao clung to Guanyu, whispering: "Is this hell? A movie set?"

"Too beautiful for hell," Guanyu reassured.

Xiaozhu tugged Ma Xiao's sleeve: "Uncle, why bring us here? We need to fight monsters!" When ignored, she declared: "Mama, this man's deaf!"

Laughter erupted, easing tension. Jinciyu Lang guffawed: "Deaf backstabber indeed!"

The Master approached, aura imposing: "You sought to destroy the Demon Tree?"

Guanyu met his gaze: "The village's tree concerns you how? Your name isn't carved on it."

Jinciyu Lang stepped protectively forward as the Master's eyes narrowed. Guanyu remained calm: "Had they wanted us dead, we'd already be corpses."

"Courageous!" The Master nodded. "No wonder you challenged my disciples - a Realm Lord expert!"

Shock rippled through the hall. Ma Xiao stared - Realm Lords were legendary warriors. Why had this one surrendered?

Chapter 3099: Hold Your Tongue

The Master continued: "Yet your body bears demonic taint. Explain yourself."

Guanyu shrugged: "Overestimated me. Were I truly a Realm Lord, would I be here?"

Xiaozhu interrupted, tugging the Master's snow-white beard: "Did you dye this? Looks real!"

"Impudent!" Ma Xiao thundered before being calmed by his Master.

The Master studied Guanyu: "The Demon Tree's purpose transcends your understanding. But let us dine first."

Suspicious but famished, the captives were led to a guest chamber. Their feast? Steamed buns, pickled radishes, and watery soup.

"This your usual fare?" Guanyu sighed.

Ma Xiao explained: "Meat dishes require preparation. We ascetics seldom consume flesh."

Jinciyu Lang brightened: "Saw livestock pens earlier! They'll serve proper food."

Guanyu nodded: "Likely kept for special occasions."

Xiaozhu's father kowtowed continuously, muttering prayers to these "immortals".

Chapter 3100: Sumptuous Feast

True to word, servants soon brought roasted fowl and braised pork. The aromas revived weary spirits. Yet beneath the hospitality lurked unspoken motives - why would celestial beings bother with mortal captives? The true feast of revelations had yet to begin...
