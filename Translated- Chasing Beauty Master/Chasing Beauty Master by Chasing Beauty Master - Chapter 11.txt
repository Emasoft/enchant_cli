“Sister Mo, stop hitting! Answer the phone first!” Guan Yu pleaded repeatedly. Good heavens—she’d bitten him last night, and now this morning’s beating. This detection system was such a scam!

Had she actually slept through it all last night? From the looks of it... holding her, holding hands—she couldn’t accept any of it! A wave of bitter disappointment washed over Guan Yu as he sat up, his face falling.

After delivering a fierce punch to Guan Yu’s shoulder, Mo Ling winced and shook her wrist, glaring at him with teary indignation. “You jerk, just wait...” she huffed, flipping over to grab her phone from the bedside.

“Hello... Sister Shilei.”

“Huh? Last night? I didn’t go back. After calling you, I wandered around to avoid those people! When I tried returning, the school gates were locked! Mmm... no, I... I stayed at a guesthouse!”

“No! Who’d share a room with him?” Mo Ling shot Guan Yu a venomous look as she snapped into the phone.

Guan Yu burst into laughter, but before he could sit up properly, Mo Ling raised her plump little foot and kicked him hard in the stomach.

**Chapter 25: You’re Responsible**

“Shut up... don’t laugh!” Mo Ling mouthed threateningly, putting on her fiercest glare.

“Mmm... lying isn’t good,” Guan Yu shrugged, feigning innocence with a pout.

“You’re still talking!” Mo Ling raised her foot again, aiming another kick.

The first strike had caught him off guard, but only a fool would be hit twice the same way. As her foot flew toward him, Guan Yu casually caught her soft little toes in his palm, grinning mischievously.

“Pervert! Let go!” Mo Ling hissed, covering the phone. But as his fingers closed around her delicate foot, a thrill shot through him. Defiantly, he tickled the sole through her thin stocking with his free hand.

“Ah! You... it tickles!” Mo Ling squirmed, her other foot flailing wildly. Guan Yu ignored the kicks, relentlessly tormenting her sensitive arch.

Her petite foot, plump and fair, was utterly enchanting. The translucent skin revealed faint blue veins, adding to its allure.

Trapped between humiliation and ticklish agony, Mo Ling twisted Guan Yu’s arm fiercely, her face flushed as she gestured urgently at the ongoing call.

“Oh...” Guan Yu smirked, releasing the tickling but keeping hold of her foot.

Rolling her eyes, Mo Ling refocused on the call. “Sister Shilei, what did you say? I didn’t catch that...”

“Oh... you’re coming to the guesthouse? No need—I’ll wake Guan Yu and return to the dorm. What? You’re already here?” Mo Ling’s face fell as she glared accusingly at Guan Yu.

He spread his hands helplessly—this was her own lie! They’d clearly slept together, entangled all night...

After hanging up, Mo Ling scowled. “Let go! Or I’ll kick you again!”

Guan Yu chuckled, unmoved by her threats.

“Jerk! Pervert...” Mo Ling began pedaling her legs furiously, like riding an invisible bicycle, her upper body thrown back for leverage.

After several blows, Guan Yu yielded, releasing her foot.

But as Mo Ling gleefully pressed her advantage, a sudden *rip* silenced the room. Both froze—Mo Ling’s tight pants had split catastrophically at the crotch during her vigorous kicking.

Her ample curves had strained the fabric beyond endurance. A gaping tear now exposed her milky thighs and the lacy yellow panties beneath.

Mo Ling sat petrified, legs splayed mid-air, while Guan Yu stared dumbstruck at the mesmerizing glimpse of her most intimate secrets—the plump folds and tantalizing crevice outlined by taut lace...

“I... I’ll die of shame! You beast!” Mo Ling wailed after stunned seconds. Guan Yu remained transfixed, overwhelmed by this sudden divine vision.

As Mo Ling sat up in defeat, beyond concealing the damage, she wailed, “What did I owe you in past life? Two days knowing you and I’m ruined! How can I go out like this?”

“Sister Mo, don’t cry! It’s like wearing a swimsuit—here, take my shirt to cover up.” Guan Yu quickly offered his shirt, tying it around her waist.

“This is all your fault! Come here—I’m biting you again!”

“Again?” Guan Yu paled.

“Don’t want to?” She grabbed a pillow threateningly.

“Fine, bite...” He reluctantly offered his arm, but his gaze drifted back to her exposed lace trim and the dark curls peeking through.

“Still looking? Shameless! Want a closer view?” Mo Ling spread her legs defiantly through tears.

Guilt-stricken, Guan Yu cupped her tear-streaked face. “I’m scum, okay? This was all accidents. You’re irresistibly attractive—any man would stare. Punish me however you want.”

Mo Ling sniffled, pulling a blanket over herself. “Coincidences? Now my reputation’s ruined! You’re responsible!”

**Chapter 26: The Mischievous Girl**

“I’ll take responsibility!” Guan Yu nodded fervently.

But how? As he hesitated, Mo Ling exploded: “What can you possibly do? I never want to see you again!”

Dejected, Guan Yu began unbuttoning his shirt.

“Wh-what are you doing?” Mo Ling shrank back fearfully.

He tossed her the shirt and walked out shirtless. Watching him leave, Mo Ling felt unexpected pangs of guilt. Had she been too harsh?

Perhaps he’d never meant to disrespect her. The memory of his gentle thumb wiping her tears stirred something deep within...

After washing up, Mo Ling tied Guan Yu’s shirt around her waist and crept out nervously.

Downstairs, she found Liu Shilei waiting alone. “Where’s Guan Yu?”

“Left already. He mentioned your pants split—told you those tight jeans were risky!” Shilei giggled, leading her away.

“He didn’t... see anything, right?”

Mo Ling’s heart sank further. He’d kept their secret. Had she wronged him?

Wandering the streets shirtless, Guan Yu mused on their whirlwind 24 hours—multiple intimate exposures, a night embrace, now this bitter separation.

As he lingered near campus, a familiar figure caught his eye—the little thief who’d stolen his phone! She stood by a van containing a slumbering mastiff-sized Tibetan mastiff.

The girl taunted the chained beast, jumping back when it growled. But her final mocking shout startled the dog into breaking free—its massive form lunging straight for her!

**Chapter 27: Super Soldier Mode**

As the snarling mastiff charged, Guan Yu sprinted toward the petrified girl. The dog reached her first—a black avalanche of muscle and fangs.

Time slowed. Adrenaline surged as Guan Yu tackled the girl aside, the mastiff’s jaws snapping empty air where her throat had been.

Rolling to his feet, Guan Yu faced the raging beast, every sense heightening. His vision sharpened—the dog’s muscles tensing, saliva strands glinting. A strange energy coursed through him as he dropped into a combat stance...
