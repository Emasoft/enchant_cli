“Good then.” Young Master Li set his mind at ease and said, “I should return home first to see Old Master’s stance, and incidentally inquire about this Young Master Jiang matter.” He thought to himself that this time, he’d have words for the old man—how dare he gift his favorite carriage to Young Master Jiang?

The household had countless carriages. Any could have been given to Jiang, yet the old man had deliberately chosen his most cherished one. Young Master Li resolved to confront his father thoroughly upon returning.

After Guanyu left, Wang Jun drove the carriage straight to Liu Yun’s home. Upon arrival, Guanyu leapt down from the vehicle.

“Liu Yun, stop your chores. Pack your belongings quickly and come with us. I can only apologize—I may have endangered you,” Guanyu declared upon entering.

Liu Yun, still dazed, asked numbly, “What’s happened? Why must I leave? Didn’t you say yesterday you weren’t going?”

“Circumstances have changed. Gather your essentials immediately. Take Xiaoyuan and flee with us to safety first,” Guanyu urged before turning to Wang Jun. “Help her pack.”

Recognizing the urgency, Liu Yun said, “Wait a moment. There’s little to pack—just some worn clothes. Nothing else matters except…” Her voice trailed off as she clutched the spirit tablet of her deceased husband, the one irreplaceable item she must carry.

When Xiaoyuan climbed into the carriage, her eyes sparkled with delight. “Mother, this carriage is so spacious!”

“Mm, I’m glad you like it.” Liu Yun forced a smile. “We owe this comfort to your uncle’s capabilities. Without him, we’d never ride such fine transport.” Her cheerful tone belied deep unease about impending dangers.

Wang Jun asked, “Where to now, Guanyu?”

“We’ll hide temporarily. Let’s head beyond the town—the carriage has provisions for days. There’s an abandoned temple outside where we can take shelter.”

After a pause, Guanyu added, “Then we’ll return on horseback to track the Soul Demon Sect members.”

Having settled Liu Yun and her daughter at the temple, Guanyu and Wang Jun reentered town to strategize.

“Are they safe there?” Wang Jun fretted.

“The temple’s rarely visited. The real danger lies at the magistrate’s office. Our priority is scouting for Soul Demon Sect agents here. If none exist, we’ll proceed to Zhouji City—they’ll surely have a stronghold there.”

“Let’s change clothes and investigate,” Wang Jun suggested.

Meanwhile, Young Master Li groomed himself meticulously under two maids’ care before returning to the Li Estate.

“Second Young Master has returned,” a guard reported to Old Master Li.

“What sudden sense struck him? Where is he?” the patriarch gruffed, though secretly pleased—his son’s return signaled reconciliation.

“He went straight to his quarters.”

“Dismissed.” Old Master Li simmered. The boy couldn’t even pay respects? Spoiled since childhood, stubborn as mule—the patriarch sighed. Despite recent tensions, he’d indulged this second son excessively.

For appearances, the old master remained seated. Let the pup come crawling first!

In his chambers, Young Master Li retrieved a mild poison from a cabinet—a stimulant causing euphoric highs followed by addictive cravings. Perfect for controlling his latest “acquisitions.”

Summoning a trembling maid, he demanded, “Where’s the old man?”

The servant stammered, “In… in the study!” before fleeing.

“Foolish wench,” he sneered. “You’re too plain to interest me anyway.”

Barging into the study, he confronted his father: “Why gift my favorite carriage to Jiang? Of all vehicles, why mine? Disowning me, are you?”

Old Master Li glared. “You return over a mere carriage? I’ll buy ten replacements!”

“Would you say that if I sold this estate without consent?”

“Sophistry!” the patriarch snapped. “Apples and oranges!”

In truth, Young Master Li cared little for carriages. This was merely pretext to vent. “Next you’ll give my wife away!” he goaded.

“Impudent!” The patriarch roared. “What’s mine remains mine to dispose!”

“Fine! I’ll reclaim it from Jiang myself!”

“What Jiang?” Old Master Li frowned. “I gifted it to Young Master Luo of Qujiang’s Luo Clan.”

The revelation struck like thunder. “Luo? But at the magistrate’s office, it’s Jiang parading in my carriage!”

Father and son stared—both deceived.

“A swindler!” Young Master Li realized. “He posed as Luo to us and Jiang to the magistrate! But why?”

The patriarch mused, “He took nothing valuable…”

“My carriage worth five hundred taels isn’t valuable?” the son retorted. “I’m warning Magistrate Pang!”

As Young Master Li stormed out, his father called after him: “At least stay for lunch!” The plea went unheeded.

At the magistrate’s office, Young Master Li revealed the imposture. Magistrate Pang paled. “A fraud? But he claimed Liu Yun was kin!”

“Then interrogate her! If she lied, arrest them all!”

The plot thickened—who was this mysterious pretender, and what game did he play?
