“Justice? What is justice? What is evil? Light and darkness have never been absolute,” retorted Xia Tianfeng with a contemptuous laugh, utterly dismissive of Murong Yu’s righteous declarations. “Our Dark Mercenary Corps has indeed done wicked deeds, but that doesn’t mean every brother in the Dark Mercenary Alliance is a villain! Moreover, from what I’ve heard, your so-called ‘righteous armies’ haven’t accomplished much good these past few years either, have you?”

“Sophistry! Seems like you won’t know fear unless I teach you a lesson!” Murong Yu’s face flushed crimson with rage.

Xia Tianfeng spat on the ground, sneering. “How lofty you’ve become since climbing the social ladder! A decade ago, your Murong clan couldn’t even fart loud enough to be noticed in Jinzhou City. Now that you’ve latched onto royal in-laws, you dare strut into my Yongzhou City throwing weight around? But let me say this plainly—no matter how you posture, you’ll always remain a dog groveling at the imperial family’s feet! The Black Dragon Mercenary Corps is beyond your league!”

The verbal assault left Murong Yu trembling violently, his already frail body quaking as he raised a shaking hand. “You demon! I’ll kill you!”

As tensions peaked, a clear voice rang from the auction platform: “Cease this instantly!”

The crowd immediately settled back into their seats. Bai Xuelan, having observed the confrontation from her elevated position, now addressed the assembly with icy authority. “Troublemakers, control yourselves! This isn’t some street brawl. Hear this—every soul within my Golden Auction House is under my protection. Harm so much as a hair on any guest, and you’ll answer to me!”

The auction mistress had deliberately allowed the dispute to unfold, extracting valuable intelligence—particularly regarding Guan Yu’s recent exploits. “So the rascal truly has secrets,” she mused. “No wonder the Camel-Lion Guardian gifted him 100,000 gold coins. Though squandering it all on a Celestial-tier cultivation manual... unexpected.”

With Bai Xuelan’s intervention, the anticipated clash dissolved. Disappointed murmurs rippled through thrill-seekers while relieved sighs escaped the cautious. Many remained indifferent, focused solely on the day’s final auctions.

As the event concluded, Guan Yu lingered with companions Huang Wensheng and Amy. A voice halted their departure.

“You’re Guan Yu, correct?”

Turning, Guan Yu faced Xia Tianfeng—Xia Yue’er’s brother. Both men had anticipated this meeting, each harboring questions for the other. Studying the compactly built man in black, Guan Yu smiled. “Indeed. You’re Yue’er’s elder brother?”

At Xia Tianfeng’s nod, Guan Yu anticipated the unspoken query. “The Crystal Toad matter?”

“Precisely.”

“Since you’re Yue’er’s kin, I’ll be frank. I obtained the Crystal Toad—or rather, seized it with Yue’er’s aid. It now resides within me.”

Though prepared, Xia Tianfeng’s expression flickered. “How did consuming it affect you? Any profound cultivation impacts?”

Relaxing at the lack of hostility, Guan Yu described, “Initially imperceptible, but soon came unbearable heat—as if burning alive. Then... bone-deep transformations, like skeletal restructuring.”

Xia Tianfeng’s face mirrored each vivid description. “So the legends hold truth...” he murmured. “And your cultivation—has it truly multiplied?”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Hard to say without proper testing. Petty thugs don’t reveal true potential.”

“Then test against me!” Xia Tianfeng’s eyes gleamed. Before Guan Yu could protest, steel flashed moonlight—a blade emerged, its edge singing through night air. “Refuse, and you insult me!”

Assessing his opponent’s Great Swordsman-level aura, Guan Yu sighed internally. *Must I humor this lunatic?* Yet the eager challenge proved irresistible.

Their clash erupted—Xia Tianfeng’s Lingbo Subtle Sword technique sent invisible air ripples assaulting Guan Yu, who countered with azure energy blades. When a retaliatory strike reduced a stone ornament to rubble, Xia Tianfeng paled. “You held back earlier!”

“Mercy becomes pointless if you insist,” Guan Yu conceded, violet-hued energy now wreathing his form—a revelation that stunned spectators. Mage-rank cultivation!

The duel escalated until Guan Yu’s emerald energy blade halted millimeters from Xia Tianfeng’s throat. Breathless, both combatants froze—the Black Dragon heir marveling at defenses that repelled stone-piercing strikes, Guan Yu realizing his improved techniques showed promise against stronger foes.

As tension dissolved into mutual respect, Xia Tianfeng clapped Guan Yu’s shoulder. “Next time, take *me* to raid the Murong Estate!” The jest sparked camaraderie, two warriors united against common enemies.

Their laughter echoed through moonlit courtyards, unaware of watching eyes—or the celestial-grade manual’s secrets waiting to unfold.
