Chapter 114: Let Me Help You with My Hand

This scene would make any man lose control. Liu Shilei knelt on the bed with her long hair cascading down her back, her head slightly tilted upward as she faced the door sideways. Though details remained obscured, Guan Yu clearly witnessed her right hand moving rhythmically beneath her body – kneading, rubbing. Her face flushed with intoxicated pleasure, chest heaving as soft moans escaped her parted lips. A pink tongue occasionally darted out to moisten her lips, presenting a sight far more arousing than any adult film Guan Yu had ever watched online. His entire body shuddered as blood rushed to his head...

Was she... pleasuring herself?

Guan Yu swallowed hard, his throat clicking audibly as he drew a sharp breath. Torn between desire and conscience, he wrestled internally. Any red-blooded male would struggle to resist such temptation. Yet Liu Shilei was his cousin's fiancée – though technically unmarried, their familial connection couldn't be ignored. Moreover, her current state resulted from drugging. Would she resent him afterward if they crossed this line?

Though their interactions had been limited, Guan Yu deeply respected this woman who had secured his university admission through her connections. Watching her desperate self-gratification through the door crack, his resolve wavered. Perhaps she might actually appreciate his intervention...

Conflicting thoughts warred within him even as his eyes remained glued to the erotic spectacle. The sight proved irresistible.

Decision made, Guan Yu burst into the room without warning.

Startled by the intrusion, Liu Shilei jerked upright, her flushed face deepening to crimson. Though chemically compromised, her consciousness retained clarity. Being discovered in this shameful act by Guan Yu again filled her with mortification.

Her trembling hands futilely attempted to cover herself while her body betrayed her, continuing its rhythmic motions. Guan Yu set down his thermos, locked the door decisively, and turned to face her. The metallic click of the lock resonated with unspoken intent.

"Shi... sister-in-law," Guan Yu rasped, voice thick. "Let me help. I know you're suffering. I mean no disrespect, I just..."

Before he could finish, Liu Shilei sprang from the bed barefoot and lunged at him. Her feverish lips crashed against his as she frantically guided his hands to her chest and lower body. Hot breath fanned his neck, primal urgency radiating from every pore.

As they stumbled toward the mattress, Liu Shilei clawed at Guan Yu's clothes between desperate kisses. "No... sister-in-law, wait!" Guan Yu gasped, sudden guilt surfacing. "Let me use my hands!"

"I'm not your sister-in-law!" she panted between kisses, words slurred with passion. "Call me Shilei!"

Her relentless assault shattered Guan Yu's remaining restraint. With growling breaths, he pinned her to the bed.

Like kindling meeting flame, they shed all inhibitions – limbs entwined, hands exploring, lips devouring. Guan Yu peeled off her damp underwear and stockings from one leg, the half-removed garments heightening her allure. Discarding his sweatpants, he buried his face between her voluptuous breasts, inhaling her feminine essence.

As Guan Yu pushed up her white blouse, Liu Shilei arched into him with breathless whimpers. His mouth captured a rosebud nipple, eliciting wanton moans. Her legs fell open, blouse fully unbuttoned, bra pushed up to her neck – every inch of perfection revealed.

Guan Yu's fingers explored her soaked folds, marveling at the swollen mound before him. A living masterpiece that would drive any man wild. Blood pounded in his ears as he cupped her breasts – silken softness with resilient firmness, the perfect contradiction.

Watching Liu Shilei grind against him, Guan Yu finally succumbed. Positioning himself, he began slow penetration...

Chapter 115: I Love This Feeling

Guan Yu marveled at the velvet heat enveloping him, sensations surpassing imagination. If asked the softest substance on earth, he'd swear it was Liu Shilei's core – addictive madness incarnate.

Halfway in, sudden resistance halted him. She... was a virgin?

The realization ignited greater frenzy. Two novices fumbled through passion's dance. Beneath Guan Yu's thrusts, Liu Shilei tossed her hair back with wanton cries that liquefied his bones. Her convulsing body, disheveled hair spread across the mattress, and ecstatic-pained expression drove him to greater vigor.

Ten minutes later, white heat exploded through Guan Yu's being. The world spun away as primal release surged into Liu Shilei's depths. Her back arched violently, legs locking around him as choked cries erupted: "Nngh... ah! Aaah!"

For thirty seconds, rhythmic contractions pulsed through her abdomen before she collapsed, gazing up tenderly.

"So good..." she whispered shyly.

"Me too..." Guan Yu murmured, capturing her lips anew. Relief flooded him – no post-coital regret.

"Thank you," Liu Shilei breathed after a lingering kiss.

Guan Yu blinked. "For taking your...?"

"I never imagined such pleasure," she admitted, cheeks flushing. "Every bone melted. You don't hate me, do you?"

"How could I?" he stammered. "I feared you'd resent me!"

Her fingertips brushed his cheek. "Silly boy, I ruined you. Was this your first?"

His nod deepened her compassion. "Call me Shilei-jie. Your cousin and I... we're not actually together. That was family misunderstanding."

Guan Yu caressed her face tenderly. "Shilei-jie, I'll cherish you."

Her smile bloomed. "This was my choice. The drug... but being with you... I love this feeling."

Chapter 116: Let Me Hold You

"Happy?" Liu Shilei asked coyly.

"Beyond words. I'll take responsibility."

"Fool," she teased. "I'm five years older. People would say I robbed the cradle."

"Then we'll be discreet," Guan Yu vowed.

As he reached for tissues, Liu Shilei pulled him back. "Younger brother..."

"Yes?"

"Jiejie wants... more."

Her disheveled state – one leg still stocking-clad – reignited his passion. Youthful vigor resurged instantly.

"Ah! Guan Yu!" she cried, legs locking around him. "So good... Let's do this daily!"

Daily?! Guan Yu nearly choked. Was this the same prim lecturer? The drug's effects proved transformative.

After another half-hour crescendo, they lay breathless. Liu Shilei traced circles on his chest. "I love this..."

"Me too."

"Don't laugh at me!" she pretended to scold.

"Never," he grinned, cleaning their mingled essences – crimson proof of her virginity claimed.

"Stop staring!" she squealed, covering herself.

"But I like your scent," he murmured, sniffing his fingers.

Blushing furiously yet pleased, she directed him to fetch clean lingerie. As Guan Yu rummaged through lacy confections, Liu Shilei rolled her eyes fondly – the first dawn of their clandestine affair.
