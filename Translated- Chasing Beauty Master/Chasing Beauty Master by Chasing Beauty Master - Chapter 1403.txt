The Demon Lord harbored an immense interest in the Hidden Dragon Sword and fervently desired to obtain it. With formidable power, this weapon had been hailed as a divine artifact since a thousand years ago, playing a pivotal role in numerous great battles.

Though Xuan Ming’s cultivation was inferior to the Demon Lord’s, rendering him no match under normal circumstances, the Hidden Dragon Sword reversed this balance. Wielding it, Xuan Ming could effortlessly drive the Demon Lord to retreat, leaving him no courage to confront the sword’s might. Such was the terrifying enhancement the blade bestowed.

Legends claimed the Hidden Dragon Sword represented the ultimate aspiration for all cultivators—a treasured goal every immortal-seeking practitioner longed to attain. Yet it remained deeply concealed within the Yunqing Sect, inaccessible to most. Even catching a glimpse was rare, let alone claiming ownership. The Demon Lord’s obsession with obtaining it stemmed from his ambition to rival Xuan Ming once it fell into his hands.

The Yunqing Sect’s elders remained aloof from worldly affairs. If the Demon Lord defeated Xuan Ming, the entire sect would crumble. Despite the Demon Soul Sect’s infiltration of Yunqing over the years, no information about the Hidden Dragon Sword had ever surfaced.

“The Hidden Dragon Sword is Yunqing’s most vital treasure—their sect-protecting relic,” the Demon Lord remarked. “They rose to prominence through its power and have flaunted its might for centuries.”

“A *murderous weapon*? Impossible!” Guan Yu exclaimed. “Yunqing leads the righteous sects, serving as their emblem. How could they use such a sinister artifact as their emblem? Wouldn’t that provoke public condemnation?”

Though uncertain of the Demon Lord’s motives, Guan Yu sensed malice in his words. The Hidden Dragon Sword inspired profound dread in the Demon Lord. Even if it lay within the Crimson Lotus Sect, seizing it would prove arduous.

Moreover, the sword demanded immense spiritual energy from its wielder. Without sufficient power, it would bring only calamity. If a cultivator’s skills were lacking, the blade’s backlash could induce qi deviation or demonic possession. Conversely, in skilled hands, its destructive potential magnified with the user’s cultivation—a testament to its true lethality.

In Xuan Ming’s grasp, the sword effortlessly repelled the Demon Lord. Yet if the Demon Lord—already stronger in cultivation—wielded it, its power would soar. This unfulfilled desire festered as a perpetual thorn in his side. However, retrieving the sword from Yunqing’s depths remained a near-impossible feat.

“Righteous sects? Mere jest,” the Demon Lord said dismissively. “What defines ‘righteous’ or ‘demonic’? These are labels concocted by the masses. So-called righteous cultivators aren’t inherently virtuous, nor are all demonic followers wicked.”

Guan Yu agreed. The line between righteousness and evil often blurred. Many in righteous sacts harbored moral corruption—like Yue Jing and Lai Lixia of the Crimson Lotus Sect, whose treachery surpassed even the worst demons. Labeling them “righteous” insulted the term itself. Similarly, Lin Chen and Ling Su of Tigerhead Peak—Xuan Ming’s disciples—were cunning schemers who never performed a decent deed.

Thus, righteousness didn’t equate to virtue. The Demon Lord’s words resonated: while demons wore their malevolence openly, the righteous cloaked theirs in shadows. Even within the demonic sects, good souls existed—like Wang Xiaorong, whom Guan Yu had never witnessed committing evil, or the Yaowang sisters and Xiaocui of the Strange Demon Cave. Their methods might differ, but their actions proved nobler than the underhanded schemes of “righteous” hypocrites.

“Perhaps you’re right,” Guan Yu conceded. “To me, there’s no division between righteous and demonic—only good and evil. Both factions harbor both. I judge equally, though their methods differ.”

“True,” the Demon Lord nodded. “The world brands us as bloodthirsty fiends, yet we surpass those hypocrites draped in false morality. They preach benevolence while executing crueler deeds in secrecy, masking their rot behind virtuous facades.”

As he spoke, the Demon Lord studied the chessboard. The game had simplified: Guan Yu’s chariot pinned two pawns, but the Demon Lord seized the initiative. Using the pawns to restrain the chariot, he mobilized his own chariot across the board.

**Chapter 3640: No One Knows**

Within moments, the Demon Lord’s chariots advanced into Guan Yu’s territory, supported by a knight, poised to strike. Yet Guan Yu’s focus shifted from the game. “You called the Hidden Dragon Sword a murderous weapon. Why?”

“You remain ignorant of much. Let me enlighten you.” The Demon Lord leaned forward. “The Hidden Dragon Sword is arguably the world’s deadliest weapon, steeped in slaughter. Its bloodshed may have birthed a demonic nature—why else would Yunqing seal it away? A blade tainted by malice risks corrupting its wielder.

Centuries ago, the sword belonged to Saizu. During its forging, he suffered qi deviation and was consumed by the blade. Possessed, Saizu wielded it in a rampage that drenched the martial world in blood. In one night, he slaughtered an entire town—men, women, children—sparing none. Tell me—is that not a murderous weapon?

In the great righteous-demonic wars of millennia past, Yunqing used this same blade to reap countless lives. A tool drenched in so much blood—how could it *not* be a cursed artifact? Even if pure once, such carnage tainted it irrevocably.”

Guan Yu stared, aghast. “The sword was deemed cursed a millennium ago? Who was Saizu? A Yunqing ancestor?”

“No. After forging the sword, Saizu fell to demonic possession. Only a united effort vanquished him. The blade vanished, later surfacing with Yunqing’s founder. Despite protests, he insisted on wielding it, claiming to have purified its demonic aura. Whether true, none can say.

Thus, the Hidden Dragon Sword became Yunqing’s treasure. Yet over ages, it has claimed more lives than any artifact—proof of its cursed nature. Power doesn’t absolve its malevolence.”

“But tools aren’t inherently evil,” Guan Yu argued. “It’s the wielder’s heart that matters. A virtuous user could tame even the fiercest blade.”

“A flawed notion,” the Demon Lord interjected. “A cursed weapon carries inherent malice. Just as a villain’s nature persists despite repentance, so does the sword’s. It twists the mind, inciting bloodlust—this is its demonic essence.”

Guan Yu pondered. If the Demon Lord spoke true, Yunqing’s pride in such a weapon reeked of hypocrisy. “So-called righteous sects brandish it as a treasure, yet condemn others for wielding lesser evils. The double standard is glaring.”

“Precisely,” the Demon Lord said. “Hence, Xuan Ming dares not use it lightly. Its slaughter-tainted aura erodes the mind. Yunqing reserves it for direst need—a concession to its danger.”

Wang Xiaorong snorted. “If we possessed it, the world would decry it as a demonic relic. But in Yunqing’s hands, it’s glorified as a noble treasure. The hypocrisy!”

“Yet you still covet it,” Guan Yu observed. “Regardless of its nature, its power is undeniable.”

The Demon Lord nodded. “I’ve schemed for years to steal it, but Yunqing guards it jealously. Only elders and leaders know its location—ordinary disciples remain clueless.”

“The Demon Soul Sect rivals Yunqing in stature,” Guan Yu noted. “Yet Yunqing’s reliance on the sword reveals their weakness. Without it, they’d crumble before your sect.”

“Naturally,” the Demon Lord said, chin lifted. “Without that blade, Xuan Ming’s arrogance would vanish. My sect would dominate.”

**Chapter 3641: No Disdain**

The Hidden Dragon Sword had long shackled the Demon Soul Sect. Had their founder, Ancestor Menghua, left a comparable artifact—like his Eight-Sided Drum technique, which the Demon Lord still sought—the balance of power would shift. Yet direct conflict remained unwise, as mutual annihilation benefited neither.

“Your knight overlooks my cannon’s reach,” Guan Yu warned, eyeing the board. The Demon Lord had positioned his knight within striking distance, but Guan Yu hesitated—a trap seemed likely. Despite scrutinizing the layout, his amateurish skills detected no ruse. The Demon Lord, however, concealed a checkmate in three moves.

Suppressing a smirk, the Demon Lord watched Guan Yu take the bait. “You devour pieces recklessly,” he chided as Guan Yu’s cannon claimed the knight. A pawn advanced, threatening Guan Yu’s advisor. Simultaneously, a distant chariot slid into position, sealing Guan Yu’s fate.

“Checkmate,” the Demon Lord declared. “Your skills, while decent, pale against mine.”

Wang Xiaorong, drowsy until now, jolted upright. “So soon? Impossible!”

Guan Yu sighed, conceding. “I’m no match for you. Chess was never my strength.”

“Well played,” the Demon Lord chuckled. “Xiaorong, fetch wine and dishes. Let us drink.”

“Send someone else!” she protested, recalling her vow not to leave Guan Yu’s side.

“Must you defy me before guests?” the Demon Lord scolded affectionately. His indulgence toward her was evident.

“Go,” Guan Yu urged. “I’ll be fine.”

Reluctantly, Wang Xiaorong rose, casting a wary glance before exiting. The Demon Lord’s laughter echoed as the game concluded, the pieces settling like their unresolved rivalry.
