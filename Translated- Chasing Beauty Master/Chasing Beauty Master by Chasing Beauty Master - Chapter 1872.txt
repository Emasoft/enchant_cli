“In truth, Master Cao exaggerated this matter. The situation isn’t as he claims—he’s merely spinning tales. The day before yesterday, several martial artists did visit Prince Consort Jiang Yuan Kai’s residence, but contrary to Master Cao’s claims, they weren’t demanding the East Sea Dragon Pearl.

Outside parties currently believe the East Sea Dragon Pearl lies in the Emperor’s possession. Though many covet it, none dare openly confront Jiang Yuan Kai over it.

‘Old Qin, how could you remain ignorant of such significant news?’ Master Cao continued his fabrication. ‘Those martial artists nearly overwhelmed the prince consort’s gates, clamoring for Jiang Yuan Kai to surrender the East Sea Dragon Pearl. When he refused, they kidnapped Princess Jiang Xin within two days. Mark my words—this was undoubtedly the work of those reckless rogues.’

‘Before such immense wealth, those martial artists discard all scruples. Imperial authority means nothing compared to the treasures of the East Sea. No one rivals their disregard for life.’ Master Cao’s words began swaying Master Qin’s perspective.

If true, the matter did seem suspicious. Yet Master Qin remained distrustful of Master Cao.

This Cao lord likely sought to monopolize the East Sea Dragon Pearl through underhanded means. Master Qin even suspected the so-called ‘martial artists’ were Cao’s pawns, sent to pressure Jiang Yuan Kai.

These thoughts remained unspoken, however. Without evidence, voicing them would only invite denial.

‘Master, the young master requests your immediate presence. He claims urgent business.’ A subordinate’s voice echoed from outside.

Both masters froze—such an interruption was unprecedented. Qin Huan usually approached directly, even during meetings. What warranted this summons?

‘It must be critical.’ Master Qin rose. ‘I’ll go at once.’

Turning to Cao, he added, ‘My greater concern isn’t Princess Jiang Xin’s kidnappers, but whether the Emperor will exploit this incident to weaken our Four Great Families.’

Master Cao stiffened—this possibility hadn’t occurred to him.

‘I’ll return shortly.’ As Qin departed, Cao seethed alone in the chamber: ‘That old fool tries to frighten me with alliance talk? Pathetic.’

Even if the Emperor moved against the families, Cao felt secure. Once he obtained the East Sea Dragon Pearl and its treasures, all clans—even the throne—would be irrelevant.

With the Cao family’s current strength, imperial suppression meant nothing. After securing the treasure, they’d dominate the realm. That insufferable Qin elder would be crushed beneath his heel.

Outside, Qin Huan waited anxiously. ‘Father, a grave discovery demands privacy.’

Hastening to an empty room, the younger Qin locked the door, tension etched on his face.

‘What requires such secrecy?’ Master Qin pressed.

‘Is Cao still here? He mustn’t overhear.’

‘Speak freely. What did you uncover?’

‘While investigating the Black Gate Manor shipments, I traced stolen goods to a seafood tavern—one owned by the Cao family! The manager is Xiao Shao, that woman Qu Hua mentioned.’

‘Get to the point!’

‘Xiao Shao is Cao’s relative. Our shipments are being diverted to their taverns, cutting their supply costs by stealing from us!’

‘That double-crossing cur!’ Master Qin exploded. ‘Smiling to my face while pilfering my goods! I’ll make Cao repay every stolen coin tenfold!’

‘What’s our move?’ Qin Huan asked.

‘Return with guards. Let’s confront that dog.’

Reentering the chamber, Cao smiled innocently. ‘Brother Qin, shouldn’t we exploit this chaos against the Duan and Tang families?’

‘Indeed.’ Master Qin suppressed his fury. ‘Incidentally—do you know someone named Xiao Shao?’

Cao paled. ‘A… distant cousin’s child. She’s acquainted with Young Master Qu Hua.’

‘Why the sudden interest?’

‘I hear she manages your seafood taverns,’ Qin Huan interjected.

‘Even Young Master Qin knows this?’ Cao’s grin faltered as realization struck.

‘If she’s your kin,’ Qin pressed, ‘why are our village’s shipments rerouted to your taverns?’

Cao’s composure shattered—the scheme was exposed.

‘You viper!’ Master Qin shattered his teacup. ‘You dare steal from me while preaching alliance? Our families are through! I’ll ruin your house!’

‘Misunderstanding! Let me explain—’

‘Lies! You’ve robbed me blind! Guards—bind him!’

As retainers restrained Cao, Master Qin snarled, ‘Seal Cao’s taverns! Arrest Xiao Shao!’

Meanwhile, Guan Yu hovered above Kyoto’s gates, scanning the darkened countryside. Finding no leads, he descended near a hillside shrine.

A faint glow drew him to derelict temple doors barred from within. Slipping inside, he found only ruins—until a discarded torch beneath the altar hinted at recent visitors. Though empty now, the evidence suggested fleeting occupation...
