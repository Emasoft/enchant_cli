“If it were a street vendor selling buns, Lin Chen could certainly let everyone eat their fill, even packing leftovers for those unsatisfied. But a large establishment like this posed trouble. With so many people, a single meal might bankrupt him!

Yet leaving now seemed impossible. The group had already settled into the reserved seats arranged by Guan Yu. Even if Lin Chen tried to make them leave, they’d likely refuse. Resigned, he steeled himself and entered.

Guan Yu’s group had claimed prime seating. Siqi sat cheerfully beside Guan Yu, while Azhe and Wang Jun flanked her other side—at least they were companions she didn’t dislike.

Spotting Lin Chen’s approach, Guan Yu stood and announced, “I’ve ordered an assortment of delicious buns and side dishes for everyone. Find a seat quickly—we’ll start eating soon. If anyone wants more, just ask! Our dear vice-captain here is carrying hundreds of taels of silver. Since our sect leader, Master Xuan Ming, provided this travel fund, and we’ll have little use for silver once we enter the desert tomorrow, let’s feast today and fortify ourselves!”

The group cheered at Guan Yu’s words, clearly appreciating his consideration. Guan Yu continued, “Senior Brother Lin Chen, as the treasurer, you’ve been excessively frugal. The inn you chose last night was appalling. Everyone, don’t you agree?”

“Yes, absolutely!”

“The rooms were freezing!”

Murmurs of agreement rose, some hesitant to offend Lin Chen but their expressions betraying assent. Guan Yu pressed, “I urged everyone to rest here to prepare for the desert, yet you provided such wretched accommodations.”

Lin Chen retorted, “You should be grateful! Last night’s cold was unbearable. I froze like a dog searching for that inn—it was the best I could manage!”

His defense held some truth—he *had* braved the cold. But Guan Yu knew it was mere pretext. Better inns lay closer to last night’s teahouse, yet Lin Chen had deliberately chosen distant, inferior ones.

Without exposing him, Guan Yu said, “Let’s leave yesterday behind. Today, we feast to make up for it. But tonight, we *must* secure proper lodgings.”

Lin Chen remained silent, his reluctance evident. As a notorious miser, every tael from Xuan Ming’s funds felt like his own. Spending more pained him.

Guan Yu declared, “Tomorrow, we march into the desert! Today, we replenish our strength—eat, drink, and rest well. Purchase all necessities!”

Catching Lin Chen’s eye, he added, “Our esteemed Vice-Captain Lin Chen oversees all expenditures. Any silver needed must come from him.”

Sighing, Guan Yu said, “Senior Brother Lin Chen… in the desert, excess weight becomes a burden. Carrying hundreds of taels will only hinder you. Better to spend it on essentials for the group.”

Lin Chen nodded curtly, though inwardly he seethed. *Even if I die, I’ll protect my silver! Hundreds or thousands—I’ll carry every tael through the desert!*

“Eat first,” Lin Chen said. “Afterward, I’ll find a better inn to avoid more complaints.”

Guan Yu chuckled, “As long as everyone’s content, I’m satisfied.”

The group focused on their meal, knowing preparations awaited.

**Chapter 4442: A Favor to Watch**

Sweat beaded Lin Chen’s brow as he surveyed the laden tables. *Damn it, this feast must cost a fortune! Guan Yu’s determined to bleed me dry!*

Three tables overflowed with assorted buns, dishes, and wine. Half-eaten, the group already satiated, Lin Chen hatched a plan.

Rising, he announced, “Enjoy your meal. I’ll secure better lodgings now.”

As he turned to leave, Guan Yu intercepted him. “Wait! Let’s settle the bill first. I’ll accompany you. If more orders come, I’ll cover them.”

Lin Chen inwardly cursed Guan Yu’s ancestors. The spread was barely half-consumed—no further orders were needed! Yet before the group, he couldn’t protest. The silver was public knowledge, and hoarding it might spark rumors of embezzlement.

“I’ll handle the payment alone,” Lin Chen insisted, forcing a smile. “Stay and eat.”

Guan Yu smiled, resuming his seat. As long as the bill was paid, all was well.

At the counter, Lin Chen gestured to the tables. “How much?”

A wizened clerk squinted, tallying beads and fingers. Lin Chen’s eye twitched—the abacus showed over a hundred taels!

“Thirty-three taels, young master,” the clerk finally said.

Relieved yet pained—it was two days’ worth of expenses—Lin Chen rummaged through his purse. Finding thirty-two taels, he stalled.

“Grandfather, rest now. I’ll take over,” a melodious voice interjected.

Lin Chen glanced up—a statuesque beauty stood behind the counter, her ivory skin and elegant poise arresting. Though dressed plainly, her noble bearing shone through.

The clerk gestured to Lin Chen. “This gentleman hasn’t paid yet.”

“I’m *counting* it!” Lin Chen snapped, flustered before the beauty.

“Thirty-three taels,” the clerk repeated.

“Ridiculous! Do I look penniless?” Lin Chen blustered, producing a 500-tael note. “Will this suffice?”

“We accept only silver or gold,” the clerk said.

The beauty glanced indifferently at the note. Lin Chen, deflated, produced forty taels. “Keep the change—buy yourself cosmetics.”

As the clerk left, Lin Chen lingered. “Might I know your name, fair lady?”

“Call me Amei,” she replied coolly.

“Amei! Might I have the honor of your company?”

“I’m occupied,” she said, gesturing to the counter.

“I’ll wait!” Lin Chen insisted.

**Chapter 4443: False Generosity**

Amei met his gaze. “As you wish.”

Lin Chen’s heart leapt—this conquest seemed within reach.
