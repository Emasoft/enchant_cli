“I dare to ask—it’s said many disciples are searching for Guan Yu outside. Do we have any news of him yet?” Wang Jun inquired.

Elder Lu shook his head. “Not yet. Perhaps Guan Yu heard the rumors and went into hiding. But this cannot last. That is my greatest concern now.”

Wang Jun added, “Elder Lu, though I’ve had little interaction with Guan Yu, I’m certain of his character. He would never betray the Yunqing Sect. However, he despises being wronged or threatened above all else.”

“I know this well,” Elder Lu sighed. “I understand the boy’s temperament. But this decision came from Sect Leader Xuan Ming himself. None can overturn it. My fear is that if provoked, Guan Yu might join the Demonic Soul Sect in anger. That would be an irreparable loss for our sect.”

Guan Yu, a rare prodigy of both martial and mystical arts, was destined for greatness. If the Yunqing Sect forced false accusations upon him, it might drive him to rebellion—allowing the Demonic Soul Sect to reap the benefits without lifting a finger. Not only would this embolden our enemies, but we’d become a laughingstock among other sects. Elder Lu’s heart was torn: part of him hoped Guan Yu remained unfound to avoid conflict, yet he feared the young man’s loyalty might waver.

“Elder Lu, this is where Xiao Zhi is held. Sect Leader Xuan Ming is likely inside. I cannot enter further. Please keep my involvement secret—the Sect Leader forbade bringing anyone here,” Wang Jun said.

“Rest assured, I’ll keep you clear of this,” Elder Lu replied before proceeding inward.

The windowless chamber had only a heavy wooden door and a circular ventilation shaft above. Dim light revealed Xiao Zhi lying motionless on a wooden pallet, still unconscious from Elder Zheng’s earlier assault. Sect Leader Xuan Ming and Elder Mu stood nearby, deep in discussion.

“Why are you here?” Xuan Ming demanded coldly as Elder Lu entered, violating the strict prohibition against visitors.

“Sect Leader, I heard you were here and wished to inquire—are we proceeding with Xiao Zhi’s punishment? Given his condition, shouldn’t we wait until he recovers?”

Though displeased by the intrusion, Xuan Ming restrained his temper. “This complicates matters. I assumed Elder Zheng’s heavy hand caused his prolonged unconsciousness. But upon examination…” His voice tightened. “The boy’s meridians are in chaos, his blood flows backward. His life hangs by a thread.”

“What?!” Elder Lu rushed to check Xiao Zhi’s pulse, confirming the dire diagnosis. “Sect Leader, if you annihilate his cultivation now, it will kill him!”

“I’m aware,” Xuan Ming said icily. “But leaving him untreated will also be fatal.”

Elder Lu’s examination revealed worse: Xiao Zhi’s spiritual energy had spiraled out of control, compounded by blood poisoning and Elder Zheng’s attack. The boy’s vital essence was draining rapidly. The beast transformation, though halted by unconsciousness, still ravaged his body. The blood toxin devoured his life force—without intervention, death would claim him within days.

“This cannot continue!” Elder Lu pleaded. “Even for Elder Zheng’s sake, we must save him!”

Xuan Ming’s sleeve snapped like a whip. “Waste my spiritual power on a Demonic Sect spy? Preposterous!”

“Sect Leader, how can you condemn him so hastily? If he’s truly a spy, does that implicate Elder Zheng as well?”

“Impudence!” Xuan Ming thundered. “I tolerate your concern, but do not test me! Look at him—even if not a spy, he’s clearly practiced demonic arts. Should I show mercy to such filth?”

Elder Lu’s heart sank. Knowing Xuan Ming’s ruthlessness, he realized any plea was futile. The sect leader valued discipline over life—Xiao Zhi’s brilliance meant little among thousands of disciples. Even being Elder Zheng’s son offered no protection after this unprecedented scandal.

Xuan Ming needed to make an example. Leniency would breed discontent, undermining his authority. If Elder Zheng protested, he’d face punishment too—the sect leader now suspected him of collusion.

Elder Lu gazed at Xiao Zhi, grief-stricken. He’d watched the obedient boy grow into an exemplary disciple. To see him reduced to this, denied even basic compassion, chilled Elder Lu to the core. If he felt such anguish, how much worse for Elder Zheng?

“Sect Leader, absolute measures breed rebellion,” Elder Lu urged. “Force may backfire catastrophically.”

“Are you threatening me?!” Xuan Ming’s eyes blazed. “Let them rebel! I’ll slaughter every traitor before the Yunqing Sect falls!”

Elder Mu interjected, “Peace, Sect Leader. This fury serves no purpose.”

Xuan Ming exhaled sharply. “Elder Lu, I too watched Xiao Zhi mature. But see what he’s become—neither man nor beast! If we spare him and he attacks others, what then? Even if framed, his poisoned blood makes him a walking calamity!”

“There must be another way!” Elder Lu persisted. “Must death be the only path?”

“Demonic corruption warrants no mercy!”

Suddenly, Elder Lu knelt with a thud. “I stake my life on his innocence! Please reconsider!”

Xuan Ming recoiled. “Why martyr yourself for this? The matter doesn’t concern you!”

“Killing Xiao Zhi loses us not just a disciple, but Elder Zheng’s loyalty. He’s a pillar of our sect! And what of Guan Yu? If driven to the Demonic Sect, his dual mastery could destroy us!”

The words struck home. Xuan Ming paled. “You think Guan Yu would defect?”

“If cornered, even immortals break. Every faction would clamor for his power. Meanwhile, our purge of spies must be decisive yet discreet.” Elder Lu outlined a plan: stabilize Xiao Zhi, summon all elders, and screen every disciple—1,300 souls—in two days.

**Chapter 3796: The Only Path**

Xuan Ming nodded grimly. “So be it. Elder Mu, guard Xiao Zhi. Elder Lu, tend his wounds. We’ll gather the lists of disciples—no leaks, no exceptions.”

As they finalized preparations, a woman’s wail pierced the air: “Let me through! My son is innocent!”

Xiao Zhi’s mother, Luo Jie, had come. Elder Lu intercepted her, obeying Xuan Ming’s order to prevent contact. The distraught mother, a thirty-year veteran of the sect, crumpled at the gates—a portrait of a family and sect teetering on ruin.
