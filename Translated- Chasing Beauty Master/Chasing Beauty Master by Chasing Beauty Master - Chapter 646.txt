Clambering up from the ground with dejection, Hou Jinshun addressed Guan Yu: “My apologies for the offense.” His earlier fawning attempts to become Guan Yu’s subordinate now gave way to genuine humility, stripped of both the lecherous demeanor from the bar and the groveling posture of moments before. Observing this transformation, Guan Yu thought: This fellow might not be entirely useless after all.

As Hou Jinshun turned to leave, Guan Yu suddenly spoke: “I’ll never take you as a subordinate. But have you considered… becoming my brother?”

Hou Jinshun froze mid-step, not daring to turn around. Hesitantly, he echoed: “Your… brother?”

The beauty slung over Guan Yu’s shoulder began squirming uncomfortably, her drunken murmurs prompting him to cut the conversation short. Appearing instantly beside Hou Jinshun, he grasped his arm: “Where’s the nearest hotel?”

“Five hundred meters east—” Before Hou Jinshun finished speaking, the world blurred around them like streaking train windows.

“...Jingtai Grand Hotel.” As the words left his lips, Hou Jinshun found himself standing before the hotel’s entrance steps.

“Did we… just fly here?” Though familiar with supernatural tales, Hou Jinshun had never heard of anyone traversing half a kilometer in eyeblinks. Staring at Guan Yu’s composed demeanor, he struggled for words.

Despite being enrolled at Mingyang Noble High through Dong Bin’s arrangements, Guan Yu lacked identification. Nodding at Hou Jinshun, he commanded: “Book two rooms under your name.”

Now thoroughly awed, Hou Jinshun didn’t question the request, eagerly securing a single and double room. When Guan Yu deposited the intoxicated woman in the single room without exploiting her vulnerability, Hou Jinshun’s admiration deepened.

Many supernaturals were former death row convicts sent by nations, their homecoming marked by unchecked depravity that authorities tolerated for their power. Yet here stood Guan Yu – exponentially more powerful but principled, rescuing a beauty without ulterior motives. In this private scenario where consequences could easily be avoided, his restraint revealed true heroism.

Though requiring no sleep, Guan Yu prepared for tomorrow’s classes. After showering, he sat cross-legged for meditation as midnight approached. Hou Jinshun watched curiously before gathering courage: “Great One… did you truly mean making me your brother? Am I worthy?”

Guan Yu smiled: “All men are equal. I want no servile followers – only blood-sworn brothers sharing life and death. Rest now. Guard this girl tomorrow until her family retrieves her, then meet me at Mingyang Noble High.”

Mingyang Noble High? Classes? Was this paragon a teacher? Hou Jinshun swallowed his questions, knowing higher powers worked mysteriously.

By 8 AM, the woman remained unconscious, her expensive attire suggesting privileged origins. Guan Yu deduced some profound distress drove this unseasoned bar patron to drown sorrows.

As Guan Yu departed, Hou Jinshun vowed to safeguard her. “I’ll await you after school,” he added.

“School?” Guan Yu chuckled. “I’m a freshman there.” The door closed on Hou Jinshun’s stunned realization – this demigod was actually a teenager!

How could an underage Chinese become a mutant? State experiments only used adults! The mystery deepened Hou Jinshun’s awe.

**Chapter 1641: Reuniting with the Beloved**

Guan Yu’s extraordinary nature fueled Hou Jinshun’s excitement – destiny had sent this celestial being to transform his life.

During Sun Xiaoya’s second-period class, her frequent glances warned Guan Yu of impending interrogation about yesterday’s absence. Sure enough, she summoned him post-lecture: “Guan Yu, my office. Now.”

Classmates assumed this concerned yesterday’s fight, but Guan Yu knew better.

“We agreed you’d stay with us! Mother worried all night thinking we quarreled.” Sun Xiaoya instantly regretted her tone – this student owed her no domestic obligations.

Though appearing twenty, Guan Yu’s experiences dwarfed Sun Xiaoya’s understanding. “Wang Jun’s ilk can’t touch me,” he assured. “Bullies only retreat when confronted. They won’t trouble me again.” Privately, he noted their mention of mutant Mu Yun – future trouble, but insignificant to one who’d walked divine realms.

These state-sponsored supernaturals abused power with impunity. Though technically retired from Dragon Group, Guan Yu’s moral compass demanded cleansing this societal rot.

Sun Xiaoya relented under his confidence: “Just be careful. Wang Jun’s family has mutant connections. Promise you’ll come tonight – Mother insists on dining together.”

Guan Yu sighed internally. While needing freedom for his mission, he couldn’t abandon Sun Xiaoya’s ailing mother. Curing her dementia became imperative – both for the woman’s sake and his liberty.

Crucially, his true purpose here was Liu Shilei – his first love, now middle-aged after waiting twenty years. How would she react to his youthful appearance? If discovering his cohabitation with Sun Xiaoya, she might selflessly withdraw, despite Sun’s undeniable beauty. Until reuniting with his original beloveds, new entanglements were unthinkable.

**Chapter 1642: A Voice from the Past**

Post-class, Guan Yu ascended to the fifth-floor office Liu Shilei occupied as principal. The ajar door revealed a silhouette imprinted eternally in his dreams – slender, elegant, gazing through windows as if twenty years hadn’t passed.

Though forty now, time seemed kind to her figure. What traces had decades left on her face? Memories flooded back: their fateful first meeting when she was his brother’s fiancée, the accidental intimacy during a confrontation, the life-altering bronze coin discovered in Mo Ling’s bathroom...

The chain reaction that propelled him to godhood and tragic separations. Now his greatest love stood meters away, having waited decades, choosing education over luxury to preserve their connection.

As Guan Yu reached for the door, a crisp voice interrupted: “Student! Administrative matters go to the office below!”

Turning, he faced Zhu Qianqian – the young office deputy whose beauty rivaled Liu Shilei’s in her prime. Yet her sharpness melted under Guan Yu’s gaze, weathered by eons of cosmic strife.

“I’ve private business with Principal Liu,” he calmly stated.

Inside, Liu Shilei stood transfixed. The voice outside – unchanged through decades – pierced her contemplation of withering blossoms. Twenty years... had the heavens finally answered her prayers?
