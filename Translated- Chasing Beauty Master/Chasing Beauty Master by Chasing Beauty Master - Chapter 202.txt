Under Gao Wei’s complex gaze, Guan Yu descended to the ground amidst a sea of flowers. The heart-shaped floral expanse occupied most of the stage, with the two standing at its center—a breathtakingly picturesque scene.

Guan Yu slowly removed his sunglasses, his lips curving into a faint smile as he looked at Gao Wei.

“I…” He had just begun to explain when his words were abruptly silenced—by another pair of lips.

His entire body stiffened, eyes widening in disbelief.

He had imagined Gao Wei’s possible reactions to his dramatic entrance: shock, panic, even a slap across the face accompanied by a furious “You’re despicable!” Yet never had he anticipated this.

Gao Wei… had forcefully kissed him? Yes, she’d caught him completely unprepared. Was this not a clear case of assault?

The warm, jade-like softness of her moist lower lip against his mouth sent his nerves taut with tension, leaving him as bashful and flustered as a maiden tasting forbidden fruit for the first time.

Humiliation burned through Guan Yu’s veins.

From her awkward movements and rigid posture, he could tell this was Gao Wei’s first kiss. He also knew she remained a virgin. But he himself was no stranger to intimacy—a seasoned player who’d bedded numerous women. To falter so clumsily now? Utter disgrace.

Steeling himself, he resolved to take control. He would show her a different Guan Yu.

His hands encircled her slender waist, pulling gently until her voluptuous body pressed against his. Her full breasts deformed against his chest.

A flicker of panic flashed in Gao Wei’s eyes, but before she could react, Guan Yu’s tongue launched its invasion, demanding entry past her sealed lips.

Initially, she clenched her teeth, guarding her final defense. But such resistance meant nothing to a veteran like Guan Yu.

His tongue teased and tantalized at her lips, each subtle movement fraying her nerves. How could an innocent like Gao Wei withstand such seduction? Within moments, her lips parted.

With a triumphant quirk of his mouth, Guan Yu surged forward, his tongue entwining with hers in a passionate French kiss that unfolded before the entire audience.

Gradually, Gao Wei’s tension melted into tingling numbness. A soft moan escaped her—she’d never imagined kissing could feel so intoxicating.

She began sinking into their private world, until a thunderbolt of realization struck. Biting his tongue sharply, she pushed him away.

Guan Yu winced at the coppery taste of blood, staring at her in bewilderment.

Blushing to the tips of her ears yet meeting his gaze squarely, she declared: “I’m sorry, I can’t accept you.”

Chapter 501: The Lost Shoe

The atmosphere exploded into unprecedented frenzy after Gao Wei’s unexpected kiss. The crowd gaped at the passionate scene onstage—their goddess, never before linked to any scandal, now locked in deep embrace with a mysterious man whose face remained hidden.

“Be together! Be together!”

The chant ignited like wildfire, swelling until the entire venue roared with the demand.

“I’m sorry, I can’t accept you,” Gao Wei repeated, seeing Guan Yu’s confusion. “I don’t dislike you. To me, you’re extraordinary—every meeting brings new surprises. I admit I feel… something. But fondness isn’t love. And in matters of the heart, I’m selfish. I won’t share my love. So I can’t accept you.”

Here, she wasn’t the celebrated star, but simply a university student laying bare her heart.

Guan Yu’s burning gaze held hers. He struggled to contain his mirth, then burst into silent laughter.

“What’s so funny? I’m serious!” She glared, cheeks puffing.

“I’m seriously laughing,” he countered. “You thought I was confessing?”

“Weren’t you?” Her heart sank with foreboding.

“Do I seem that flamboyant? I’m just doing my job as a human shield.” He shrugged.

Understanding dawned. Guan Yu had always been low-key—if interested, he’d never make such a spectacle. His closing words confirmed it: he’d intercepted someone else’s planned confession.

Immediately, she thought of Bo Jie—and the implications.

The full picture emerged: her own wishful thinking had led to that impulsive kiss. Humiliation burned. “You… you’re bullying me!”

“Understand now?” Guan Yu asked casually, ignoring the frenzied crowd.

“Why didn’t you say earlier?” she gritted.

“You never gave me the chance.” He licked his lips, savoring the memory. “I never expected you to keep promises so… literally.”

She glared. This was classic scoundrel behavior—exploiting advantages then feigning innocence.

Though seething, she had no rebuttal. She’d indeed silenced him with a kiss the moment he landed.

“What now?” Guan Yu’s earlier annoyance had evaporated into smug satisfaction. “I can’t stay exposed. No more newspaper headlines.”

“You think there’s another option?” she snapped.

He smirked, donning his sunglasses. In one fluid motion, he swept her into his arms.

“Ah! What are you doing?” she cried as he sprinted backstage. With his gravity system activated, he outpaced even Usain Bolt, vanishing like the wind.

The crowd erupted. Fans stampeded after them, trampling the floral display into wreckage.

Event planners stared in dismay. Was this Bo Jie’s scheme? Abandoning everything after winning the beauty? The carefully orchestrated香水 promotion lay in ruins.

Meanwhile, the true culprit sped to an underground parking garage, settling into a car borrowed from Luo Cheng.

“Perfect solution, no? They never saw my face.” Guan Yu grinned.

Gao Wei shot him a resentful look. “Perfect? You made me lose a shoe.”

Chapter 502: You Pervert

Surveying the ruined venue, Feng Minglun’s rage boiled. His meticulously planned发布会—especially Bo Jie’s confession stunt meant to showcase their new香水—lay in tatters. The rose sea’s subtle fragrance, crucial for the product launch, went unnoticed.

“Brainless horndog!” He lit a cigarette, cursing. His projected fivefold sales increase had evaporated.

“Mr. Feng,” his secretary approached, adjusting her glasses. “We found Bo Jie—unconscious in a dressing room. The man onstage wasn’t him.”

“What?!” Feng roared. “Find that impostor!”

As the secretary departed, Feng’s mind flashed to a suspect...

Chapter 503: Beast and Worse Than a Beast

“Lost a shoe?” Guan Yu glanced at Gao Wei’s feet, hidden beneath her white dress. “How? I carried you carefully.”

“You ran like a madman!” Her cheeks pinked under the car’s dim light—today marked her first kiss and first time being carried, both by the same man.

“Returning to the hotel?” he asked.

She hesitated. “The paparazzi...”

“My villa, then. Temporary refuge.”

She eyed him suspiciously. “With your harem? No thanks.”

“Where else? It’s empty now.”

“I won’t. You’re a pervert.”

He smirked. “Says the one who forced a kiss. I should fear you taking advantage.”

Gao Wei wished the earth would swallow them both.
