“However, Xuanming had no intention of letting Guanyu rummage through the storeroom for materials. If allowed, that shrewd lad would undoubtedly make off with all the valuable items.

Xuanming was utterly convinced of Guanyu’s discerning eye. The boy would surely recognize every treasure, and decades of accumulated resources would be plundered in a single visit. More importantly, Xuanming himself lacked the authority to grant such access. Permission from the elders was required for anyone to enter the Yunqing Sect’s storerooms.

The warehouse in the back mountains fell under Elder Xu’s jurisdiction. Without his approval, no one—not even sect chiefs or the Sect Leader—could enter that hallowed ground, second only to the Ancestral Hall in importance. Such were the Yunqing Sect’s rules: depositing treasures with Elder Xu was simple, but retrieving them? That was another matter entirely.

Hesitating, Xuanming asked, “Guanyu, might I inquire what materials you require first for crafting this hand crossbow?”

“Anything will do,” Guanyu replied bluntly. “A basic hand crossbow can be made from ordinary wood or iron wire, but its potency depends entirely on the materials. Superior components yield deadlier weapons, even if the crafting method remains unchanged.”

Chief Lu interjected, “So you’re saying quality materials determine the crossbow’s power? Garbage in, garbage out—is that it?”

“Precisely. Uncle Lu understands well. The principle mirrors that of bows—a weapon’s worth lies in its components. A crossbow forged from premium materials could fire iron bolts with devastating force, while inferior ones might struggle to launch bamboo arrows effectively.”

Xuanming pressed, “Then specify your requirements. Let’s first create a prototype for testing. List what you need, and I’ll procure it.”

Guanyu acquiesced, realizing immediate access to the storeroom was unlikely. Once he demonstrated the crossbow’s potential, Xuanming would beg him to raid those reserves. “Very well. For now, I require refined iron or mysterious steel, high-tensile materials like animal sinews, and skilled craftsmen. With these, I can produce one within ten-odd days.”

The demands weren’t trivial. As Xuanming hesitated, Chief Lu nodded eagerly. “Give me days to gather materials. Sect Leader need only procure the artisans. Agreed?”

“Of course. The craftsmen are my responsibility,” Xuanming agreed readily.

Guanyu calculated—this arrangement spared him effort. Once materials and artisans arrived, work could commence. “Then I’ll take my leave,” he said, turning to depart.

“Wait!” Xuanming halted him. “You mentioned multiple crafting methods. Could you document them all?”

Guanyu shot his master a guarded look. “Master, even a tiger can’t chew two bones. The blueprint you hold suffices. Without my guidance, even master craftsmen couldn’t replicate other designs. Let’s avoid complications.”

He masked his irritation—Xuanming’s greed knew no bounds. The original blueprint had been bait to access the storeroom, now denied. Worse, the Sect Leader sought to milk more knowledge.

“After perfecting this model,” Guanyu placated, “with better materials and artisans, I’ll provide other blueprints. Agreed?”

“Very well. Prioritize this prototype—I’m eager to witness its power,” Xuanming conceded.

Chief Lu inquired, “Common bows use hemp or ox sinew. What specifications for the crossbow’s string?”

“With Uncle Lu’s capabilities,” Guanyu smiled, “surely you won’t insult me with inferior fibers? The harder and more elastic, the better.” He knew the mountains teemed with mystical beasts yielding superior tendons.

**Chapter 3835: Still Fuming**

Guanyu continued, “Master, I request leave to visit mortal markets. While Chief Lu gathers materials, I’ll procure essential components. Five days should suffice—I’ll return as preparations conclude.”

Xuanming approved. “Go. Submit expenses for reimbursement. Purchase quality items freely.”

Guanyu’s eyes gleamed. Chief Lu glanced sideways—the Sect Leader would regret that open purse.

“My thanks, Master. However, I’ll need an assistant for heavy lifting.”

Chief Lu suppressed a smirk—the boy hadn’t left yet and already demanded porters. “Any preferences?”

“Wang Jun of Bamboo Peak or A’Ze of Xuanzhong Peak would serve,” Guanyu suggested.

“Ah, Wang Jun!” Chief Lu endorsed. “A promising disciple—sharp, reliable, cultivation talent. Worth mentoring.”

Xuanming nodded. “Your judgment holds. Let Wang Jun accompany him—good experience.”

Guanyu inwardly scoffed. These elders, blind to Wang Jun’s true identity as a demonic sect infiltrator! But exposing him served no purpose. Better keep the spy close—Wang Jun’s connections might prove useful.

“I depart tomorrow. Please notify Wang Jun,” Guanyu stated before leaving.

**Chapter 3836: Good News**

By dusk, orders reached Bamboo Peak. Summoned unexpectedly, Wang Jun feared exposure. Instead, Chief Mu announced: “Accompany Guanyu on a procurement trip tomorrow.”

Wang Jun feigned delight while protesting poverty. “Honored Master, but my funds...”

“Guanyu bears the purse. You needn’t spend,” Chief Mu dismissed.

Ecstatic, Wang Jun sought out Xiao Zhi. Bribing guards with silver, he whispered through cell bars: “Guanyu returned! He bested Chief Xiang, wagered fifty years of spiritual power to cure your Blood Toxin!”

Xiao Zhi panicked. “He shouldn’t have come back! Warn him to flee!”

“Calm yourself,” Wang Jun soothed. “The inspection concluded—a Left Sky Peak disciple exposed as spy. Guanyu thrives.”

Relief flooded Xiao Zhi. “The inspection... what happened?”

“One caught, beaten senseless by the Sect Leader. But listen—Guanyu secured your cure. Once Chief Xiang recovers...”

Their whispers continued into the night, silver buying secrecy as Wang Jian spun his web of deception.
