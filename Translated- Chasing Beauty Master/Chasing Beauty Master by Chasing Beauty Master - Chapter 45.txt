Biting his lip secretly, Boss Liu was truly festering with resentment. As one of the two major gangs in Southern City, his brothers operated gambling dens, brothels, and drug trafficking in full swing, while the Fire Gang abstained from all illegal activities. Relying solely on their family industries and companies through construction projects, they supported hundreds of members. The comparison made Boss Liu feel thoroughly outclassed, his inferiority burning like acid in his gut.

Now that the Fire Gang had intervened, Boss Liu's smoldering frustration reached new heights.

"Fine. Since the lady speaks, we'll table this matter for now," Boss Liu said with forced joviality, though his eyes remained cold. "I wouldn't budge for others, but for our years of friendship... Consider this debt settled on the young brother's account!"

As Feng Xin and Boss Liu calmly discussed territory divisions across several streets, Luo Cheng glanced around nervously. Seeing the immediate danger had passed, he hesitantly approached Guan Yu, safety helmet in hand, standing silently like a chastened soldier.

Guan Yu continued smoking leisurely, the picture of nonchalance. Only after the negotiations concluded did Luo Cheng trail behind the departing pair like a shadow.

"Investigate that young man's background," Boss Liu hissed through clenched teeth, his beady eyes narrowing at Guan Yu's retreating figure. "Every detail."

Chapter 107: Skipping Class on the First Day

Emerging into the crisp air, Luo Cheng cleared his throat and blocked Guan Yu's path. "Sister Xin, thank you," he said with deep respect.

"Don't thank me." Feng Xin tilted her head toward Guan Yu. "He's your benefactor."

As she strode toward her car, Guan Yu admired her retreating form. This shrewd woman probably saw through all my intentions, he mused.

"Brother, words can't express... I'm Luo Cheng." The young man extended a calloused hand.

Their handshake sealed an unspoken pact. "No need for formalities," Guan Yu waved. "I'll find a way to raise the money within two days. Your loyalty to brothers while keeping principles – that's admirable. Just steer clear of loan sharks. Their bite is worse than any snake's."

Luo Cheng raked fingers through his bangs. "A brother's family emergency... We pooled everything but still came short. He borrowed behind my back..." His sigh carried the weight of failed leadership.

"Consider me your brother now." Luo Cheng pressed a crumpled number into Guan Yu's palm. "Anything you need—"

"Guan Yu." The name came with a shoulder clap. "Let's leave the past buried." As he turned toward Feng Xin's idling car, Luo Cheng's throat tightened with gratitude. Against all odds, providence had sent this unlooked-for savior.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Guan Yu studied Feng Xin's profile. "Any trouble caused?"

"Come to my office tomorrow," she said without glancing up. "The bank's closed now."

Guan Yu chuckled. "No need. I've got plans."

"Plans?" Her arched eyebrow could have cut glass. "More bodyguard gigs for scum like Liu Jun? Not everyone's as tolerant as me."

Warmth bloomed in Guan Yu's chest despite her frosty tone. Temporary boyfriend? Bodyguard? The lines blurred intriguingly.

When Feng Xin dropped him at campus, her parting words held unexpected softness: "Don't let pride get you killed. That money's an open offer."

Watching her tail lights disappear, Guan Yu calculated the daunting sum. Twenty thousand in two days... Looks like I'm skipping class.

Chapter 108: Serpent in the Skirt

Dawn found Guan Yu prowling campus when distant chatter snagged his attention: "...construction site dug up a snake pit this morning! Thick as a man's thigh..."

His curiosity warred with urgency until a familiar silhouette caught his eye – Liu Shilei crouched awkwardly by the grove, her pallor alarming.

"Shilei-jie!" He rushed forward, noting how her pencil skirt strained against trembling thighs. Beads of sweat dotted her ashen face. "What's wrong?"

"Stomach..." she gasped through clenched teeth. "Old... problem..."

As Guan Yu gently helped her rise, a sudden shriek pierced the air. Liu Shilei collapsed backward, frantically hiking her skirt. "Snake!"

The squirming intruder – barely twenty centimeters – disappeared beneath black chiffon. Without hesitation, Guan Yu plunged his hand up her skirt, fingers skating over nylon-clad warmth until he seized the wriggling threat.

"Don't release it here!" she pleaded, cheeks flaming as he examined the tiny serpent. Her gasp came when inspecting the bite mark – twin punctures already purpling on milky flesh.

Chapter 109: Hallucinogenic Venom

"Hospital. Now." Guan Yu's command brooked no argument, though his diagnostic power revealed non-lethal venom. Still, the swelling demanded attention.

Liu Shilei resisted, mortification overriding pain. "Just... help me to the office."

As they staggered toward sanctuary, Guan Yu's senses prickled. The serpent's dying thrash had released an odd musk... cloying and vaguely familiar. By the time they reached her desk, the air seemed thick with invisible petals.

"Your leg—" Guan Yu knelt, oblivious to how his breath ghosted over nylon. The venom's hallucinogenic properties struck simultaneously – his vision swam with kaleidoscopic patterns as Liu Shilei's pained whimper morphed into something... else.

Their eyes met. Two flushed faces. One rapidly quickening pulse.
