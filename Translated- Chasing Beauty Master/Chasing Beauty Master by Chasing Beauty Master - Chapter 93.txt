“Just you alone, what can you possibly do?” Xu Chengqi said dismissively.

“What if you add me to that equation?”

Chapter 225: The Hongmen Banquet (Part 2)

“Old Xu, don’t forget I’m still unharmed,” Old Master Feng sighed.

“Though I don’t know how you got so damn lucky to avoid all the poisoned dishes, what can you possibly achieve alone?” Xu Chengqi scoffed.

“Then... what if you add me to the equation?” Guan Yu rose from his chair with a sinister smile under the astonished gazes of the crowd.

This made both Xu Chengqi and Xu Xu furrow their brows. One person escaping the trap could be coincidence, but two was absolutely impossible.

“What difference does one more make?” Xu Xu sneered contemptuously.

“Indeed, what can we do?” Guan Yu chuckled rhetorically.

“Haha—” Xu Xu’s laughter abruptly choked as darkness filled his vision. An exquisite white porcelain teacup smashed squarely into his face.

The smug young man was sent flying by the gravity spell-enhanced teacup, crashing into a rockery five paces behind him with a thunderous crack.

“You—!” Xu Chengqi’s eyes bulged at the sight. Swallowing his rage, he forced an amiable smile as a new calculation formed. “Young friend, impressive skills! No wonder Old Feng took you as disciple.”

Guan Yu needed no special perception to read the man’s scheming thoughts, responding only with an enigmatic smile.

“Join my faction,” Xu Chengqi offered magnanimously. “Wealth and beauties will be yours.” His mind raced: If this talent can be controlled, excellent. If not... elimination remains an option.

“Don’t listen to him!” Lin Qian interjected urgently. “Save our Lin Sect today, and we’ll pledge allegiance to you!” With only Old Feng, escape chances were below ten percent. Add this wildcard youth, and odds might reach fifty-fifty!

“Elder Xu, I must admit your offer is tempting.” Guan Yu waved airily.

Xu Chengqi’s eyes lit up—the predictable lure of wealth and women never failed.

Old Feng watched Guan Yu’s smiling face warily. What trick was this brat planning now?

“However...” Guan Yu’s grin turned feral. “I’ve no habit of being others’ pawn.” The smile shattered on Xu Chengqi’s face like broken porcelain.

“Damn brat! You dare mock me?!” The elder roared. “Fine! Since you refuse the easy path, I’ll grant your wish for hardship!”

“You useless louts! Are you fucking statues?!” Xu Chengqi bellowed at twenty thugs by the door. “Attack!”

The gang surged forward. Outnumbered, Guan Yu grabbed another teacup and smashed it into the lead attacker’s forehead. The man crumpled unconscious.

Qi Zhi gulped watching his comrade fall, grateful he’d hidden his earlier contempt. That strike could’ve caused severe brain damage.

After hurling four cups, Guan Yu hefted his wooden chair infused with gravity magic. Back-to-back with his master, he became a whirlwind of destruction. Each chair swing sprayed blood from shattered bodies.

Even hardened gangsters recoiled at the demonic youth drenched in blood and sweat. “Come! Who else wants death?” Guan Yu growled through the agony of overtaxed muscles, secretly healing his nearly broken arms with magic.

The remaining five thugs trembled at a safe distance. They’d eagerly accepted this “easy job” capturing “soft targets”—had they known this hellspawn awaited, no sum would’ve enticed them!

“Worthless trash! Attack!” Xu Chengqi screamed. When none moved, he drew a pistol and executed his own men.

“Beast! Killing your own?!” Old Feng thundered.

“Dying by my hand is their honor,” Xu Chengqi sneered, advancing. “Don’t worry, old man—you’re next after this brat.”

The gun rose. “Years of planning nearly ruined by you. But victory remains mine. Say hello to Yanluo Wang for me.”

Chapter 226: The Earth-Shattering Punch

None anticipated Xu Chengqi’s betrayal. Of all attendees, only Guan Yu and Old Feng remained unpoisoned. Though Feng’s Bone-Shattering Fist skills surpassed Guan Yu’s, against firearms...

Guan Yu stared down the barrel, inching closer. “Stop!” Old Feng cried desperately.

“Think I won’t shoot?” Xu Chengqi’s finger tightened.

As the gun fired, Guan Yu twisted. The bullet whizzed past. Two more shots went wild as Guan Yu’s gravity magic disrupted the aim.

“Drop the gun. I’ll spare you,” Guan Yu hissed, now within arm’s reach.

“Die!” The third shot coincided with Guan Yu’s explosive lunge. A flurry of punches hammered Xu Chengqi’s torso—then the coup de grâce.

A deafening sonic boom erupted as Guan Yu’s final strike, amplified by gravity magic, launched Xu Chengqi across the hall. The elder crashed through furniture, spewing blood before lying motionless.

Silence gripped the room. Then applause erupted from the poisoned elders. “Bravo! Never seen such combat!”

Old Feng swelled with pride. His disciple had exceeded all expectations.

“From today,” declared Elder Xu, “the Xu Sect pledges allegiance to Guan Yu!” Others followed suit—unprecedented unity among Nanjing’s underworld factions.

Chapter 227: Establishing Power

Post-battle formalities concluded, Guan Yu returned with Old Feng. The elated patriarch clapped his disciple’s shoulder. “Today you’ve made this old bones proud!”

At home, Du Xiaojuan waited anxiously. “My aunt knows we’re here,” she confessed.

Guan Yu shrugged. “Let them come.” His mind already raced with possibilities—with Nanjing’s gangs united under him, new horizons beckoned.
