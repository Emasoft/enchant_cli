Guanyu gritted teeth fiercely and declared, "It seems this is why Patriarch Allen warned me not to stay here beyond three days. Very well then—I'll extend my stay! Let's see whether the Source of Life proves mightier or I, Guanyu, prevail!"

......

In Patriarch Allen's chamber within the Elven Forest.

"Father, the Dragon Clan brother has been gone so long. Why hasn't he returned? Could something have happened?"

Observing his daughter's anxious expression, Allen chuckled reassuringly, "Fear not. That dragon youth possesses great fortune and extraordinary capabilities. Even if danger arises, he'll surely overcome it!"

Though speaking thus, Allen harbored private doubts. The Isle of Life remained sacred to elves, yet even their kind couldn't linger unprotected—let alone a magic-untutored human.

His own daughter Amy remained unconvinced. The young maiden gazed toward the Source of Life with tear-brimmed eyes. "Father, I want to search for him!"

"Absolutely not!" Allen rejected without hesitation. Though the chieftain's daughter, Amy had rarely visited the isle before, never staying beyond four hours. Reckless intrusion now might complicate matters further. Moreover, having announced Guanyu's departure to the tribe, Amy's sudden appearance would arouse suspicion from factions like Locke's.

"I care not! You must find him quickly! If harm befalls him, I'll run away!"

"Run away again?" Allen massaged his temples. Overindulgence had bred this rebellious spirit—her escape attempts outnumbered visits to the sacred isle. If Guanyu weren't found swiftly, another flight seemed inevitable. Previous escapes had ended safely, but human slaver gangs hunting elf maidens remained a threat. Without Guanyu's prior intervention...

Contemplating Guanyu, Allen frowned. Five days had passed since his three-day warning. No signs emerged from the isle. Had catastrophe struck? Yet hope persisted—daily gatherers of Source reported no disturbances, implying the youth's survival.

Footsteps echoed outside. An elven guard announced: "Patriarch, Commander Locke requests audience."

"Locke? Why?" Amy questioned suspiciously.

Allen shook his head, foreboding coiling in his chest. He whispered urgently: "Whatever he says, hold your tongue. Understood?"

As Amy opened her mouth to protest, he added: "Do you want your Dragon Clan brother found?" The girl swallowed her retort, nodding reluctantly.

Entering with ceremonial bow, Locke greeted: "Locke pays respects to the Patriarch."

"Formalities waived," Allen waved. "State your business."

Locke's gaze flickered to Amy. "Ah, Lady Amy graces us."

"Hmph!" The girl turned away disdainfully. Unperturbed by habitual coldness, Locke continued: "Last night, my men reported strange occurrences—Source Fruits lie scattered daily, each bearing consumption marks."

Allen's heart lurched. Fool! Couldn't even clean his tracks!

Amy interjected sharply: "Probably rats or boars! What fuss over trivialities!"

Locke shook his head. "The isle's protective arrays bar all creatures. No living beings exist there save flora."

"Absence of evidence isn't evidence! Your conclusion reeks of presumption!" Amy's relentless counterarguments gradually wore Locke's suspicions, though his investigative intent remained.

Allen marveled—when had his willful daughter learned such debate skills? For Guanyu's sake, she transformed!

Suddenly Locke inquired: "Lady Amy, has your Dragon Clan friend departed?"

Amy stiffened. "Repeatedly told you—he left days ago! Why harp on this?"

"My apologies. When did he depart? No farewells..."

"Farewells?" Amy scoffed. "Were you acquainted?"

......

Emerging from the chamber, Locke wore stormy expression. Amy's growing hostility he attributed entirely to that meddling human. "Wait, brat. I'll uncover your schemes!"

Inside, Amy giggled triumphantly. "Father! Did you see? First victory in ages!"

Allen sighed. Naive child—Locke would surely investigate secretly. If he found Guanyu first... "When will you emerge, Guanyu?"

Outside, another maiden's heart churned. "Wretched Guanyu! Kissed me then vanished! Why... why not bid farewell? I know I'm willful, but my heart... Why avoid me?"

......

On the Isle of Life, Guanyu strove for magical breakthroughs—no mentors, no spell scrolls, only trial and error.

After seven days, his comprehension far surpassed initial stages. "Sect Master, attempt flame control again!"

Guanyu extended palms. "Rise!" White-tinged flames blossomed—core blindingly bright. Testing against a three-meter boulder, the fire sprite penetrated stone silently. Moments later, the monolith disintegrated into dust. Satisfied yet craving greater destructive power, Guanyu mused: Mountains. Rivers. Cities—all should crumble!

Wiping sweat, he recognized the flames' movement stemmed from elemental manipulation. Billions of fire particles concentrated in that deceptively small flame.

"Sect Master, when do we depart? Eternal residence here?"

Guanyu closed eyes, sensing elements flowing freely through him via Source of Life—elves' magical enhancer he couldn't rely on forever. "We leave now!"

Without comment, the Diamond Spirit understood—this isle merely marked Guanyu's magical genesis. Activating Allen's protective charm, light flashed. Reappearing across the shore, Guanyu murmured gratitude before navigating the vast Elven Forest.

"Who goes there?" A voice rang above.

Before looking up, purple-robed figure materialized—vision of celestial beauty. Though normally lecherous, Guanyu found himself awestruck... until drool betrayed him. Wiping hastily, he stammered: "I'm Guanyu!"

The violet-clad elf's disdain shifted to recognition. "Guanyu? The Dragon Clan youth?"

Nodding eagerly, Guanyu's mind raced: Coffee house rendezvous... Alas!

"What are you doing?" The maiden frowned as Guanyu struck dramatic pose.

Regaining composure, he smiled suavely: "Merely admiring your radiance. Might I know your name?"

"Nami."

"Nami! Beauty worthy of the name!"

Passing guards bowed: "Young Priestess!"

Guanyu recalled—she'd been present during his audience with Allen.

Nami smiled. "Yes, I'm the Young Priestess. My elder sister is Kami, the High Priestess."

Guanyu shuddered—memories of that mercurial woman. This purple-clad maiden proved far preferable.

Nami tilted head. "But I heard you'd left days ago..."

Guanyu grinned disarmingly. "Fond memories compelled return. Your hospitality merits proper farewells."

"You honor us! The Dragon Clan's legendary might—"

"Honor demands reciprocity. How might fair Nami express gratitude?" His roving gaze turned predatory.

Blushing furiously, the Young Priestess faltered until salvation came—"Young Priestess!"

Turning, she regained dignity. "Yes?"

The newcomer's eyes widened. "Guanyu? Why remain here?"

Guanyu seized the moment. "Explanations later!" Dragging the newcomer—revealed as Kylie, the girl he'd saved—he departed hastily, leaving Nami in contemplative turmoil.

......

Chapter 1252: The Charmer

Left alone, Nami's thoughts whirled—this brash human who stirred strange flutterings. Meanwhile, Kylie arched eyebrow at Guanyu. "Explain."

Guanyu chuckled nervously. "Let's discuss somewhere... private?"
