Just like with Guan Yu before, the slightest miscalculation in managing the car’s shifting center of gravity could result in a fiery wreck and certain death.

***

A frenzied roar erupted from Wu Haojian’s throat, his eyes bloodshot, yet his hands and feet continued struggling methodically. As long as a sliver of hope remained, he would never surrender.

***

Abruptly, ecstasy flooded Wu Haojian’s face—the car had begun tilting toward the racetrack’s edge. He’d done it. Achieved what he’d never before accomplished.

***

Driven by primal survival instincts, Wu Haojian had broken through his limits. If he survived this calamity, this breakthrough would mark a pivotal turning point in his life.

***

He celebrated wildly, madness and triumph warping his features.

***

But… but…

***

Life truly is full of twists and turns, with darkness giving way to light and light to darkness.

***

Wu Haojian’s fate shifted once more.

***

Contrary to all logic, the sports car—which should have tilted toward the track—now leaned precariously toward the cliff’s edge.

***

Were this not a literal encounter with ghosts, Wu Haojian would never have believed such a sudden reversal possible.

***

“No—!”

***

His despairing cry echoed as man and machine plunged into the abyss, culminating in a fatal explosion.

***

Guan Yu stood at the cliff’s edge, lighting a cigarette from his pocket. He inhaled deeply, his features obscured by swirling smoke, yet the murderous aura radiating from him was unmistakable.

***

“It’s all because of that damned flamboyance.”

***

His muttered words dripped with sarcasm. A night breeze swept past as he turned and walked away.

***

**Chapter 953: A Cheap Champion Isn’t Cheap**

***

To live without flair is to live without brilliance—but excess flamboyance courts disaster.

***

Had Wu Haojian driven cautiously instead of showboating, Guan Yu would never have found the opening to orchestrate his “accidental” demise.

***

After finishing his cigarette amidst the cliffside night wind, Guan Yu departed, leaving behind spiraling smoke and towering flames. He would soon reappear before the crowd as the undisputed victor, basking in glory.

***

The underground race’s finish line now swarmed with spectators—many drawn by rumors of million-dollar supercars and heavy bets. The event’s explosive popularity owed much to the豪门 syndicate’s calculated hype.

***

This was Li Yu’s strategic genius at work.

***

While Guan Yu had used his luxury vehicle to lure high-stakes wagers, Li Yu leveraged the same car as a promotional centerpiece, driving the crowd into frenzy—especially after announcing increased betting odds.

***

Utilizing豪门’s vast networks, Li Yu attracted wave after wave of spectators eager to witness million-dollar machines clash. The man had transformed an unexpected opportunity into maximal profit through relentless marketing.

***

Yet high risk walks hand-in-hand with high reward. Behind immense profits lurked catastrophic dangers.

***

If Guan Yu won, Li Yu faced financial ruin.

***

But Li Yu remained confident—Guan Yu could never claim victory.

***

Had he known that豪门’s three top racers, including Wu Haojian, had all been “naturally eliminated” by Guan Yu, what expression might he have worn?

***

The answer approached.

***

Amidst breathless anticipation, all eyes locked onto the distant straightaway. Suddenly, headlights pierced the darkness—but the approaching car’s identity remained obscured, fueling wild speculation.

***

“The champion must be Wu Haojian! He always wins!”

***

“Keep deluding yourself! That million-dollar machine’s owner will crush him! Fancy driving beats skill any day!”

***

“If that poser wins, I’ll let you use my head as a footstool!”

***

“Who wants your ugly skull? Let’s bet bigger—if I win, I get your girl for two days. You win, ride mine however you like!”

***

“Deal! You’re on!”

***

Countless such wagers erupted as the vehicle finally materialized—Guan Yu’s battered supercar, its front end mangled, rolling to a stop at the finish line.

***

The crowd erupted. Those who’d bet on Guan Yu cheered their newfound wealth, while others wailed in despair.

***

“Told you Wu Haojian was trash! Money buys victory! Though this guy’s insane—wrecking a million-dollar ride? If I were his dad, I’d beat his ass raw!”

***

“You’re not fit to be his grandson!”

***

“Enough about family—when do I get your girl?”

***

“She’s still in her future mom’s womb! Screw you!”

***

Fists flew but went ignored as all attention focused on Guan Yu emerging from his car, basking in adulation.

***

Wu Rui’s vehicle arrived moments later with a showy drift, though eclipsed by Guan Yu’s triumph. Despite his usual womanizing habits, Wu Rui now stared intently at Guan Yu, approaching with clenched jaw.

***

“Told you,” Guan Yu smirked as Wu Rui slapped his back. “Even the best racers blunder sometimes.”

***

Wu Rui’s face twitched. “Damn it… you lucked into this cheap victory.”

***

While winners celebrated, losers mourned—none more so than豪门’s members. Panicked reports surged through the syndicate’s ranks, triggering seismic shockwaves.

***

**Chapter 954:豪门 Earthquake**

***

News of Guan Yu’s victory spread like wildfire, reaching豪门’s leadership first. Executives including Chang Qing gathered around the conference table, faces stormy.

***

Li Yu studied photos from the race—every frame featuring Guan Yu’s triumphant grin. Crushing one image in his fist, veins bulging, he radiated murderous intent.

***

The mysterious million-dollar driver was none other than Guan Yu—豪门’s sworn enemy. Again.

***

Through calculated maneuvering, Guan Yu had outplayed豪门 at its own game, exploiting Li Yu’s promotional tactics to devastating effect. Despite deploying three elite racers—even authorizing lethal measures—豪门 had failed.

***

The financial repercussions threatened豪门’s foundations. Years of blood-soaked empire-building now jeopardized by one man.

***

“Confirmed,” Li Yu growled, tossing down photos. “It’s Guan Yu.”

***

The name detonated like thunder. Gasps filled the room—how could a lone outsider repeatedly humiliate the mighty豪门?

***

“Haojian and the others…?” Chang Qing asked grimly.

***

“Missing. Presumably eliminated.” Li Yu’s voice dripped venom. Four top operatives lost in days—an irreplaceable blow.

***

Chang Qing’s aged face tightened. Though seasoned through decades of turmoil, even he struggled to process this catastrophe.豪门’s bright future—poised to rival Beijing’s greatest syndicates—now hung by a thread, all because of Guan Yu.

***

Yet even amidst seething hatred, reason prevailed. Immediate damage control took priority over vengeance.

***

**Chapter 955: Welching on Debts**

***

Li Yu embodied the ideal crime lord—ruthless, visionary, formidable. Without Guan Yu’s interference,豪门 would have soared to unprecedented heights.

***

Now, that brilliance faced its greatest test. Survival hinged on navigating the storm Guan Yu had unleashed—a storm threatening to drown豪门 in debts from millions in lost bets.

***

The syndicate’s reputation, painstakingly built through years of ironclad race fixing, now teetered. Paying out would cripple them—but refusing meant destroying their credibility.

***

As executives debated desperate measures, Guan Yu’s mocking grin in the crumpled photo seemed to taunt their dilemma. The battlefield had shifted from asphalt to accounting ledgers, and豪门 was cornered.

***

In the underworld, some debts could only be paid in blood.
