“A pass?” Guan Yu said. Xue Jing’s colleague took a card from her bag and handed it to Shuangshuang. “Shuangshuang, you can’t study here without money. You know Guan Yu is busy and might not visit often. Take this card. Buy whatever you need, or call him if necessary. We’ll deliver anything you lack.”

Shuangshuang pouted, eyeing the bankcard without accepting it. “Mom already gave me living expenses before I left. I don’t need more. I absolutely won’t take Big Brother’s money.”

“Don’t blame me—this isn’t from me!” Guan Yu had anticipated her refusal and devised a plan. Passing it off as Xue Jing’s gift might make it easier to accept.

Xue Jing urged, “Why refuse, Shuangshuang? You’ll need it for clothes and other essentials. Dressing well reflects on your Big Brother’s reputation.”

“Now I’m scared,” Shuangshuang retorted. “If everything I do must protect his reputation, how can I focus on studying?”

Guan Yu realized he couldn’t let her drown in such pressures. “The pittance your aunt gave won’t last here. Take Xue Jing’s card—it’s practical.”

“It’s only 100,000 yuan. Contact us if it’s insufficient,” Xue Jing added.

Shuangshuang recoiled at the sum. Guan Yu pressed, “You’ll need funds for meals with friends, clothes, and daily necessities. Survival here costs far more than your old school.”

Though aware of the city’s higher costs, Shuangshuang argued, “Even 500 yuan monthly would be excessive. Back home, 200 sufficed.”

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “500 yuan? A single meal here might cost that! Building friendships requires treating classmates—hence the 100,000. It’s for emergencies, not frivolity.”

Pan Xiaoxia interjected, “Shuangshuang’s frugality stems from hardship. Spoiling her with cash isn’t the solution.”

“True,” Guan Yu sighed. “Her self-reliance complicates helping her. We want her comfort, but she resists.”

Pan Xiaoxia nodded. “Care isn’t just money—it’s attention. Since you’re busy, I’ll ensure she’s treated well here. Shuangshuang, rejecting Guan Yu’s efforts only hurts him. Do you want him worrying constantly?”

Reluctantly, Shuangshuang accepted the card. “If I run out, I’ll ask Big Brother.”

**Chapter 2798: A Low-Key Disposition**

“Good! That’s my Shuangshuang!” Guan Yu beamed. After settling her dorm—luxurious by school standards—he instructed Yu Gang members to protect her.

Within days, Qu Shuangshuang’s name spread campus-wide. Girls envied her connection to Guan Yu, the campus heartthrob; boys hailed her as the new “school belle,” her photo plastered on every phone. Wealthy suitors retreated after Yu Gang warnings, knowing the gang’s formidable influence.

Shuangshuang’s blend of charm and tomboyish wit won classmates over. “Wherever she goes, she’s adored,” Guan Yu remarked, relieved.

Xue Jing agreed. “Her looks and spirit captivate. We’ll just filter ill-intentioned admirers.”

As hours ticked by at a bustling street market, Guan Yu grumbled, “Where’s Second Brother Wolf? He insisted on meeting here to avoid attention, but he’s late!”

“Patience,” Xue Jing counseled.

Suddenly, a disheveled figure plopped beside them—Second Brother Wolf, guzzling beer. “You lounge here while I toil? Treat me to a proper hotel, not this dump!”

Guan Yu chuckled at his grimy attire. “Which warzone did you crawl from?”

“No luggage—travel light,” Second Brother Wolf shrugged, devouring skewers. “Sleeping rough’s efficient. Now, your news: Ying Shangu’s dead.”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit. “Where? How?”

“Tracked her south. She used a grotesque flesh-worm to shapeshift into a fat man at auctions. Exhausted after reverting, I struck. Found her selling treasure maps—profiteering between regions.”

“Any maps on her?” Guan Yu pressed.

“None. But your rival’s gone. Cheers to that!” Second Brother Wolf grinned, cracking open another beer.

**Chapter 2799: One Less Adversary**

Guan Yu absorbed the revelation—Ying Shangu’s demise eased looming threats. As Second Brother Wolf feasted, schemes dissolved like foam on ale.
