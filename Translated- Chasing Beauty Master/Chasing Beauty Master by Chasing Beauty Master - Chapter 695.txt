Witnessing Guan Yu’s desperate efforts to protect her physical form despite his grievous injuries, Xue Jing’s heart swelled with emotion, yet it ached unbearably.

...

**Chapter 1766: Sublimation**

The Demon Fang seemed startled by Guan Yu’s ferocious reaction. Turning its head, it glared coldly at him and sneered, “Fighting us to the death? Blood Demon—kill him! His corpse shall be your reward!”

At this command, the Blood Demon’s face twisted with greed. [Read the latest chapters of this book by searching 800.] Blood Demons did not merely feast on human blood—their true nourishment came from consuming flesh and bone. Yet due to the War Demons’ overwhelming dominance, Blood Demons had been reduced to mere vassals, left to scavenge the blood their superiors disdained.

Hearing the Demon Fang assign both Guan Yu’s death and corpse to the Blood Demon, the Phantom Demon’s eyes flashed with envy. Flattering shamelessly, it crooned, “Lord, this human’s power is extraordinary. The Blood Demon alone may struggle to subdue him. Allow me to assist!”

The Blood Demon naturally objected to this encroachment, but the Demon Fang—unwilling to show favoritism—nodded. “Very well. Both of you attack him. End this swiftly—we must depart.”

As the three demons callously discussed butchering him and Xue Jing like livestock, Guan Yu’s fury erupted. His spirit-energy sword slashed through the air with a razor-sharp gust toward the two demons.

The Phantom Demon, weak in direct combat but adept at mental manipulation, dissolved into black mist. An intangible aura seeped from the fog, lunging at Guan Yu. [For the latest chapters, visit 800book.net.]

Earlier, Guan Yu had fallen prey to the Phantom Demon’s illusions due to the Soulfrost Array’s interference upon entering the ice cavern and his distracted state upon seeing Xue Jing’s frozen form. Now, however, its tricks held no power. Snorting contemptuously, Guan Yu activated his Earthshrink Technique, appearing instantly before the Blood Demon. His blade arced toward the demon’s skull like a silver waterfall.

When the Phantom Demon’s mental assault failed, its mist surged to envelop Guan Yu.

From the ground, Jones—despite his chest wound—gathered his remaining spirit energy. Flames erupted from his palm, searing into the Phantom Demon’s mist.

The three demons had dismissed Jones as insignificant. But as his flames scorched its essence, the Phantom Demon shrieked in agony, abandoning its attack to flee toward the Demon Fang. “Lord, save me!”

Though Jones’ fire-attuned spirit energy was potent against dark creatures, his reserves were meager. The flames sputtered out mid-flight, leaving the Phantom Demon hovering awkwardly under its master’s displeased glare.

...

Meanwhile, the Blood Demon’s humanoid form glistened crimson as if dipped in blood, reeking of iron. Guan Yu recognized this as the accumulated essence of countless victims.

Despite Guan Yu’s recovered energy, his strike couldn’t fatally wound the Saint-level Blood Demon. The demon laughed hoarsely, catching the spirit blade in its crimson claws.

Jones hurled weaker flames at the Blood Demon, but unlike its kin, the demon endured the sizzling burns without flinching.

“Quit dawdling!” barked the Demon Fang. “Kill him and retrieve the woman’s corpse!”

Earlier, the Demon Fang had hesitated to claim Xue Jing’s body from the ice pedestal, sensing peril. Now it urged the Blood Demon forward as a test.

Crushing Guan Yu’s sword, the Blood Demon aimed a vicious kick at his chest. “Master, look out!” Jones cried, lunging to intercept.

*Boom!* The ice shattered—but Guan Yu and Jones had vanished.

Using his Minor Teleportation technique while the demons were distracted, Guan Yu reappeared thirty yards away. Enraged, the Blood Demon charged—only to freeze as an arctic aura erupted from the pedestal.

Even the Demon Fang paled. “Who’s there?!”

All turned to the ice platform. Guan Yu and Jones screamed in unison: “No!”

Xue Jing’s statue-like form was sublimating—melting into vapor without liquid traces, as if ascending directly from solid to gas.

Tears streaming, Guan Yu lunged for the pedestal. An invisible force blasted him back ten yards.

**Chapter 1767: Spirit-Coalesced Form**

Guan Yu teetered on madness. Earlier, Xue Jing’s ice-encasement and the Phantom Demon’s illusions had clouded his mind. Now, witnessing her dissolution, reason frayed.

He couldn’t accept losing the girl who wrinkled her nose when laughing, who tugged his sleeve calling “husband,” who playfully demanded marital duties and dreamed of bearing his child.

If Xue Jing died, he’d never forgive himself.

As he scrambled up, a whisper brushed his ear: “Silly husband, stop charging. I’m still here!”

Xue Jing’s voice—yet her dissipating lips didn’t move. Could a frozen corpse speak?

The others showed no reaction. *Soul transmission?* Guan Yu marveled. This required formidable spiritual strength—how had she learned it?

Noticing Guan Yu’s rebound and Xue Jing’s half-vanished head, the Demon Fang barked, “Blood Demon! Retrieve that body! Succeed, and her limbs are yours!”

All demons recognized Xue Jing’s ice-sculpted form had absorbed massive pure energy. Consuming her would grant power surpassing Guan Yu’s.

Though covetous, the Blood Demon hesitated, recalling Guan Yu’s violent repulsion. The Phantom Demon seized the chance to curry favor: “Move, cur! Retrieve our lord’s prize!”

Seething internally, the Blood Demon inched forward as Guan Yu—hearing Xue Jing’s ethereal giggles about “invisible power” and “annoying itchiness”—watched her physical form vanish, energy coalescing midair.

*Spirit-Coalesced Body!* Guan Yu realized with dawning hope. Simultaneously, the Demon Fang howled, “Fool! Her energy fades—hurry!”

Compelled, the Blood Demon transformed into a crimson streak toward the pedestal. Guan Yu teleported to intercept, blade gleaming. “Parasitic filth! Touch my woman over my corpse!”

...

**Chapter 1768: Slaying the Blood Demon**

Though unfamiliar with demonic arts, Guan Yu sensed the violent power in the Blood Demon’s twin crimson orbs—Blood Essence Thunders.

As the Phantom Demon slithered behind Guan Yu, Jones focused his waning flames on it. The Demon Fang, meanwhile, oozed toward the pedestal until Guan Yu teleported into its path.

“I’ll handle this pest,” the Demon Fang growled. “You blast that barrier!”

Black tendrils shot from its claws as the Blood Demon hurled Thunders at the ice platform. Guan Yu’s blade met the Demon Fang’s assault—while above, Xue Jing’s nascent spirit-form shimmered invisibly, her giggles echoing privately in his mind.
