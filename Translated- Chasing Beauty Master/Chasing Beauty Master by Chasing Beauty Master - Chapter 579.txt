When Guan Yu and Huo Lingling arrived at the plaza, they saw hundreds already gathered. At the center stood a three-meter-high testing platform, its front lined with seats occupied by the elders and the Sect Master of the Hun Tian Sect.

“Sect Master, when will the test begin? All the brothers are ready!” asked an elder nearby.

Huo Zhentian smiled. “Wait a moment. I’m expecting someone.”

Though unspoken, the elders knew he referred to Guan Yu, recently infamous in the sect as a “good-for-nothing” who couldn’t even emit a wisp of magic energy.

As Guan Yu and Huo Lingling wove through the crowd toward Huo Zhentian, envious glares followed.

“Hmph! That outsider actually won Lingling’s favor? Disgusting!”

“Why is he here? Does he even qualify for the test?”

“Who cares? He’s just trash. Without magic energy, what threat could he pose?”

A slightly older man sneered, “True, but let’s stay cautious. What if he’s been acting weak all along?” This was Hu Xiaohai, eldest son of Second Elder Hu Dahai. Arrogant and spiteful, he resented Huo Lingling’s indifference—especially her closeness to Guan Yu.

“You spurn me for that waste? Today, I’ll crush him before your eyes!”

A voice then rang out, silencing the crowd. “Quiet, everyone! I, Elder Suoluo, will oversee today’s magic energy assessment. As you know, magic energy is graded from one to ten. Those below Level Three are unfit to cultivate magic and must instead train as warriors to serve the sect!”

Guan Yu recognized Suoluo—a Fifth-Level Archmage, second only to Sect Master Huo. The crowd tensed. Though warriors had their role, all knew they were expendable pawns compared to revered mages.

Suoluo continued, “Our centuries-old sect adapts! Those who fail may challenge a qualified disciple. Victory grants them eligibility!”

Cheers erupted from the less confident, while the assured remained unmoved.

“To motivate you,” Suoluo added, “the top ten will earn entry to the Scripture Pavilion to select a spell scroll. The grade you obtain depends on your skill!”

Murmurs surged. Even the lowest Mystic-grade scrolls could transform one’s cultivation.

“Now, let the test begin!”

Silence fell. Suoluo produced a golden list. “First candidate: Jiamasi!”

A gaunt man stepped forward. Guan Yu frowned—Jiamasi was Hu Xiaohai’s lackey.

Placing his hand on the crystal orb, Jiamasi watched it glow jade-green.

“Jiamasi: Level Four. Pass!”

Supporters applauded, but Guan Yu scoffed. “Level Four? Pathetic.”

Huo Lingling tugged his sleeve. “Don’t underestimate him! He advanced from novice to intermediate mage in a year!”

Guan Yu nodded, hiding his past as an Eighth-Level Archmage. Now, his crippled magic forced humility.

“Second candidate: Hu Xiaohai!”

The crowd stilled as Hu strode past Guan Yu and Lingling. “You’ll regret crossing me,” he hissed.

Lingling retorted, “Less talk, more action!”

Gripping the orb, Hu channeled his energy. Colors flashed—green, blue, deep blue—then settled into pale violet.

Gasps erupted. *Violet!* A prodigy indeed.

Hu smirked until he noticed Guan Yu and Lingling whispering, ignoring his triumph. Rage simmered. *Just wait...*

Onlookers jeered at Guan Yu’s calm. “Look at him! Either he’s resigned or hiding behind Lingling!”

“After the test, let’s teach him a lesson!”

Guan Yu heard every word. *Fools. My foundations remain. Underestimate me at your peril.*

“Tenth candidate: Mofei!”

Guan Yu’s loyal follower approached. “Don’t disappoint me,” Guan Yu said.

Mofei grinned. “I’ll make you proud!”

Scoffs followed. “Seeking guidance from *him*? How desperate!”

Ignoring them, Mofei touched the orb. It turned teal.

“Mofei: Level Four. Pass!”

Overjoyed, Mofei rushed to Guan Yu. “I did it!”

“This proves nothing,” Guan Yu chided gently. “True cultivation begins now.”

Lingling added, “Repay him by excelling!”

As dozens more tested, results aligned with predictions—half passed, few excelled.

“Candidate Ninety-Five: Huo Lingling!”

The sect’s princess bounded forward. Murmurs rippled—what level had she reached?

Placing her delicate hand on the orb, she focused. A *crack* echoed as the crystal flushed pale violet.

The plaza erupted. Another prodigy—and Guan Yu’s secret smile deepened.
