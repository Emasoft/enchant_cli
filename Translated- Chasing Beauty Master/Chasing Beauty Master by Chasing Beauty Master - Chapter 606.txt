“You’re well aware of the unique nature of the magic pharmacist profession. If you rashly walk into the auction house like this, not only will you draw attention, but what if you expose me as well?”

After hearing Bikamao’s explanation, Guan Yu immediately understood and replied, “I’m sorry, Bikamao. I was too impatient and acted recklessly.” As he finished speaking, he noticed several black robes hung to dry at a street corner. Grinning, he exclaimed, “Just what I needed!”

With that, Guan Yu sprinted toward the corner.

“Heh, fits perfectly—like it was tailor-made for me!” After donning the black robe, he turned to Bikamao and asked, “Well? Does this work?”

“Yes. Once inside, don’t speak a word. Leave everything to me.”

“Understood. I’ll follow your lead.”

Adjusting the robe and ensuring nothing seemed amiss, Guan Yu stepped out of the alley.

Weaving through the bustling crowds, he navigated several streets before emerging into a quieter area. Before him loomed an imposing building guarded by patrolling sentries. Taking a deep breath to steady his nerves, Guan Yu touched the cool white jade vial in his pocket and approached the guards.

The sentries made no move to stop the cloaked figure. They knew only those with considerable influence dared approach this place—and anyone foolish enough to cause trouble here would meet a swift end.

Ignoring the guards, Guan Yu strode into the auction house. The moment he entered, a refreshing coolness dispelled the stifling heat outside. His eyes widened as he scanned the grand hall, marveling at his surroundings. Soon, his gaze landed on a door emblazoned with golden characters: “Magic Association.”

“This must be where they auction magic elixirs,” he murmured.

Knocking before entering, Guan Yu found a spacious yet sparsely furnished room. At its center stood a middle-aged man studying him.

The man frowned briefly before forcing a smile. “Sir, are you here to purchase magic elixirs?” Though Guan Yu’s stature suggested youth beneath the robe, the man assumed he was a wealthy scion seeking potions. Guan Yu shook his head.

“Not here to buy?” The man’s tone turned skeptical. “Then why visit the Magic Association? To auction elixirs?” His voice dripped with mockery.

Guan Yu bristled but bit back his anger, recalling Bikamao’s instructions.

“Correct. This old master has come to auction magic elixirs. Do I appear unworthy?” Bikamao’s voice emerged—raspy and aged—startling Guan Yu, who inwardly cursed the cat.

The middle-aged man paled. Recognizing that magic could alter appearances, he hastily bowed. “Forgive my oversight, esteemed sir! I meant no disrespect!”

“Ignorance is forgiven. Let it pass,” Bikamao croaked.

Relieved, the man inquired, “What does the master wish to auction? Magical artifacts, perhaps?”

Guan Yu shook his head again, retrieving a jade vial and placing it on the table.

“What is this?” The man uncorked the bottle, and an invigorating aroma filled the air. His eyes widened. “You’re a magic pharmacist?!”

“Indeed,” Bikamao affirmed.

“What does this elixir do?”

“Spirit-Concentrating Elixir. It aids mages in focusing their minds to better perceive ambient magical energies—effective only for Mage-level practitioners.”

“It enhances mental focus?!” The man gasped, understanding its value in accelerating cultivation. “Might there be… side effects?”

“None. The formula is mild, harmless to the body.”

Guan Yu stifled a laugh—the original undiluted brew had been split into twenty vials, ensuring its gentleness.

“Please wait while I summon Master Martin, our elixir appraiser!” The man hurried out, leaving the vial behind.

“Return swiftly. My time is precious!” Bikamao growled, settling into the vacated chair.

Ten minutes later, footsteps echoed as the man returned with an elderly appraiser. The latter’s robe bore a golden moon encircling a black orb—the emblem of a Second-Rank Magic Pharmacist.

“Esteemed sir, this is Master Martin, our appraiser and a Second-Rank Magic Pharmacist!”

Guan Yu studied Martin, noting the magical ripples in his attire. Meanwhile, Martin scrutinized the cloaked figure, intrigued by the rare presence of a fellow alchemist.

Outside, rain drummed against windows as storm clouds loomed. Guan Yu sighed—the downpour disrupted his plans to refine metal. Retreating indoors, he resolved to study movement techniques instead.

*Thud!*

A forceful blow sent Wang Shan staggering. “Griffin! Know your limits!” he spat, rising from the muddy ground.

Elder Griffin’s beard quivered with rage. “Your son pledged the Jade Gate to our Lin family! Burning the jade stores—what madness is this?”

“The sun scorched them. Blame nature, not us,” Wang Shan retorted coldly, intent on provoking conflict to eradicate the Lin family.

Griffin snorted. “Since when does sunlight ignite jade?”

“Speak plainly—your Lin family lacks the strength to claim the Jade Gate. Return when you’re worthy!”

After a tense pause, Griffin growled, “Very well. Three months hence, at the Martial Tower. Under the gods’ gaze, let none dare deceit!”

As the Lin entourage departed, Wang Shan smirked.

That night, under dim starlight, Lin Mo paced his chamber. “Elder Griffin, challenging the Wangs is folly! How can we find a Platinum Battle King in three months? Without one, our family faces annihilation!”

Griffin glowered. “You think I’ve squandered my years? Had your ancestors not summoned me back, I’d have achieved far more!”

Lin Mo sighed. “I know you resent us, but we must act wisely. Abandon the Jade Gate if it spares our clan!”

“Fool!” Griffin stormed out, leaving Lin Mo dejected. Powerlessness gnawed at him—in this world, strength trumped all.

“Summon a family council tomorrow. Everyone attends!” he ordered a servant.

As footsteps faded, Lin Mo gazed at the shrouded moon. “Gods above, protect House Lin…”

—————————————————————————————

Dark clouds loomed over the Lin family hall, mirroring the tension within.

“According to Patriarch Lin Mo, we require at least a Platinum Battle King?” Lin Hui’s brow furrowed.

Lin Cai nodded. “But such experts are prideful. Why would they meddle in a provincial feud?”

“What say you, Jin’er?” Lin Mo turned to Guan Yu, his youngest brother, renowned for his cunning.
