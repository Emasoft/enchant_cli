“He never expected Guan Yu to take advantage of his outburst, seizing the moment when all his subordinates were momentarily distracted to charge into the Ferrari.

He thought Guan Yu would drive off to escape. So the moment Guan Yu entered the car, he immediately ordered the doors closed.

His subordinates reacted swiftly. The man nearest to the door pressed a red button, causing a steel mesh security gate to slam down with a heavy thud.

*Roar!*

The Ferrari’s engine growled low and powerful, its headlights suddenly blazing with a blinding glare that left everyone ahead momentarily sightless.

Guan Yu gripped the steering wheel, foot on the accelerator, his eyes blazing with madness as he stared at the descending steel gate.

With a sudden stomp on the gas, the red Ferrari shot forward like an arrow loosed from a bow, leaving a crimson afterimage in its wake.

The car charged like a frenzied bull into the crowd of gunmen instead of fleeing toward the exit.

From start to finish, Guan Yu had never intended to run.

The armed men panicked. With no time to shoot, they scrambled aside, desperate to avoid being trampled.

As the Ferrari scattered the crowd and hurtled toward a wall—a collision that would mean certain death—Guan Yu yanked the steering wheel and交替 stomped the brake and accelerator.

*Screech!*

The tires screamed against the pavement as the Ferrari spun twice, narrowly avoiding disaster.

Then, Guan Yu floored the gas again, sending the car careening toward another luxury vehicle’s front end, as if aiming for a fiery collision.

*Crash!*

In the blink of an eye, the two cars collided.

What happened next defied belief:

The Ferrari’s rear lifted from the impact, pivoting around the front until the car nearly stood vertical—a ninety-degree stunt straight out of a circus act.

Chen Gang gaped in disbelief.

Since when could cars perform such tricks? For Guan Yu, with his gravity-defying system, it was child’s play.

The thought flickered through his mind, but his focus snapped back as he realized Guan Yu’s suicidal maneuver had a purpose.

Suddenly, his face paled. “Don’t shoot!” he roared.

But it was too late.

The scattered gunmen rose, their weapons trained on the Ferrari.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

A hail of bullets tore into the exposed fuel tank.

What followed was inevitable.

*Boom!*

The Ferrari erupted into a fireball, igniting every luxury car in the dealership.

The night sky lit with an inferno as explosions rocked the city.

Guan Yu stood on a nearby hill, clutching a dossier, his expression cold as he watched Shunfeng Car Dealership burn.

This was his handiwork. He’d planned it meticulously, using his gravity system to expose the fuel tank before escaping unscathed.

As for the others inside… their fates meant nothing to him.

*Those who sow evil reap it.*

After a moment, Guan Yu turned and walked away without looking back.

**The Next Morning**

Li Xi rose early, practiced yoga, showered, and donned comfortable athletic wear. Sipping tea, she read the morning paper when the doorbell rang.

She didn’t move. She already knew who it was.

Guan Yu handed her the dossier with a smile. “Mission accomplished. The documents are safe. Though your Ferrari… you’ll need a new one. I’ll cover the cost.”

The car was now scrap metal—thanks to him.

Li Xi didn’t take the file. Instead, she fixed him with a serious gaze. “You’ve made a mortal enemy of Haomen. Until you’re stronger, avoid confronting them head-on. It’s too dangerous.”

She slid the newspaper toward him.

The headline blared: *Massive Explosion Exposes Car Theft Ring!*

The article detailed how the blast exposed Haomen’s illegal car stockpile and armed thugs. Chen Gang now lay hospitalized under police guard.

“Looks like I did the cops a favor. Think they’ll give me a citizen’s award?” Guan Yu joked, tossing the paper aside.

**Chapter 916: You Feel Good?**

Li曦 shot him an exasperated look.

While she worried about his future,关宇 remained nonchalant. “If Haomen wants revenge, let them come. But if they’re smart, they’ll stay away.”

“You should tell that to Li Yu yourself,” Li Xi retorted, referring to Haomen’s ruthless leader.

关宇 chuckled. “He’ll come looking soon enough.”

His gaze drifted downward—to where Li Xi’s宽松的运动装 revealed a glimpse of snow-white cleavage and black lace.

“Still looking?” Li Xi’s cheeks flushed crimson as she caught his stare.

关宇 coughed awkwardly.

The morning’s tranquility shattered as Li Yuanshan’s voice boomed: “Xiao Yu! I heard you were in the city, but I never expected—”

The older man froze mid-sentence.

His eyes widened at the scene before him:关宇’s hand buried in his daughter’s blouse.

**Chapter 917: You Want More?**

Li Yuanshan’s cough snapped them apart.

“I… uh… the weather’s nice today. Maybe we should take a walk?”关宇提议 lamely.

Li Xi glared, her voice icy. “You enjoyed that?”

关宇 blinked. *Of course I did.*

“Remove your hand. Now.”

Before关宇 could respond, footsteps echoed—Li Yuanshan descending the stairs, witnessing everything.

The older man’s eyes nearly bulged from their sockets.

“Ahem. Young people… enthusiasm is good, but perhaps… privacy?”

关宇’s hand remained lodged between Li Xi’s breasts, feeling her racing heartbeat.

*To pull out or not?*

He opted for boldness.

“Uncle Li!”关宇 greeted brightly, hand still in place. “Lovely morning, isn’t it?”

Li Yuanshan’s mustache twitched. “Indeed. Though perhaps you two should… discuss the weather elsewhere?”

The standoff broke as Li Xi stomped关宇’s foot. He yelped, withdrawing his hand.

“We were just… discussing business strategies!”关宇 claimed weakly.

“With your hand down her shirt?” Li Yuanshan raised an eyebrow.

“Er… innovative management techniques?”

Li Xi stormed off, face burning.

Left alone with his未来岳父,关宇 shrugged. “We got carried away?”

Li Yuanshan sighed. “Just… be discreet next time.”

The morning’s drama settled into awkward silence—until Li Xi’s shout echoed from the kitchen:

“关宇! You’re buying me a new Ferrari. Today!”
