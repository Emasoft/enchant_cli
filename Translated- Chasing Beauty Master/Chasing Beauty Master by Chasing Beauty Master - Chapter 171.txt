After Jiang Chao recounted the entire incident to him, Wen Shuquan became utterly convinced. Jiang Chao even described how Guan Yu had treated him, prompting Wen to discover the gaping hole in his chest. He was astounded by Guan Yu's miraculous healing abilities.

Turning to the pale-faced Guan Yu, Wen Shuquan said gratefully, "Young man, I shall remember this life-saving debt. Wen Shuquan will surely repay you in the future."

Guan Yu weakly shook his head. "You overstate matters, Elder. I merely happened to pass by. When one can save a life, one shouldn't hold back. Though you've regained consciousness, I strongly advise a full medical examination to ensure complete recovery."

Though capable of conducting more accurate diagnostics than machines, Guan Yu knew his depleted energy reserves couldn't sustain another use of the copper coin's power without risking collapse.

Wen Shuquan nodded appreciatively, admiration shining in his eyes. Countless people clamored to establish connections with influential figures here, yet this youth hadn't exploited the situation to claim favors—a rare integrity among modern youth.

Drawing on decades of experience, Wen trusted his judgment. He detected genuine concern in Guan Yu's words, devoid of pretense. Such a person was worth befriending.

Noticing Guan Yu's trembling frame, Wen urged, "Young man, how are you feeling? Let my personal physician examine you."

Guan Yu smiled. "No need. I can manage the walk home."

Only he knew how to treat this exhaustion—medical drips would prove inefficient compared to his direct "recharging" method for instant recovery.

"Where do you reside? You seem unfamiliar here," Wen inquired.

"I'm temporarily staying with Elder Zhao Zilong, not far from here. I'll take my leave now to rest," Guan Yu replied honestly.

"Old Zhao?" Wen's eyebrows rose in surprise. He hadn't expected connections to the founding revolutionary Zhao Zilong.

"Rest well then. I'll visit Elder Zhao soon to properly express gratitude," Wen said. "By the way, we haven't learned your name."

"Guan Yu. The 'Yu' from 'universe'," came the explanation.

After bidding farewell to the assembled dignitaries, Guan Yu departed.

The impressed officials recognized Guan Yu's extraordinary medical skills. If he could rescue Wen from death's door, trivial ailments would be child's play. At their age, everyone harbored minor health concerns—having such a miracle worker nearby proved invaluable.

Though curious about his methods, they tactfully refrained from pressing questions given his evident exhaustion.

Shortly after Guan Yu's departure, Wen's personal physician arrived in panic, astonished to find his patient fully recovered. He immediately escorted Wen for comprehensive tests, joined by Jiang Chao and curious onlookers wanting verification of the atypical myocardial infarction diagnosis.

The examination results stunned everyone. Guan Yu's diagnosis proved flawless—doctors confirmed this rare infarction type required specialized equipment for detection. Yet the youth had identified it through mere observation.

Even more astounding was the complete resolution of symptoms through mere seconds of treatment. When had myocardial infarction ever been cured without medication in moments?

Guan Yu's reputation as a medical prodigy solidified among the elite.

Meanwhile, Yang Yang seethed with frustration. His scheme had backfired spectacularly—instead of discrediting Guan Yu, he'd elevated the youth's status among these powerful figures. Yet his hatred burned undiminished—he vowed retaliation.

Chapter 422: Sleep

Returning to Zhao Zilong's residence, Guan Yu found the elder absent and Zhao Jing'er's door still closed—presumably sleeping after yesterday's ordeal.

Seizing the opportunity, he retrieved a wire and locked himself in his room. Inserting the wire into a socket, chaotic electricity snaked across his body. Despite violent tremors and hair standing vertical, he relished the sensation. Five minutes later, he emerged fully recharged, fist clenching with restored power.

Yet this exposed critical vulnerability—without immediate access to power sources during emergencies, like yesterday's assassination attempt where only fortuitously nearby tasers saved him and Jing'er from electrocution. Carrying numerous tasers proved impractical and risked exposing his secret.

With Lin Dong's constant threat looming, Guan Yu needed portable high-capacity energy storage—a task beyond his academic capabilities. Seeking Zhao Zilong's military connections felt unethical, leaving Li Yuanshan, the jade magnate, as ideal solution.

Lacking contact details after losing his phone in yesterday's explosion, Guan Yu needed Zhao Zilong's help—but the elder remained absent.

Venting frustration through vivid revenge fantasies against Lin Dong, Guan Yu decided to check on Jing'er. Finding her door unlocked, he peeked inside—and froze.

Jing'er lay sleeping sideways, snow-white back exposed, legs entwined with sheets revealing tantalizing glimpses of rounded curves. The disheveled bedding partially unveiled her bosom, lips curved in a peaceful smile glowing in morning light.

Swallowing hard, Guan Yu battled temptation. Though considering Jing'er a sister, memories of their accidental intimacy and stolen first kiss weakened resolve. As he teetered between retreat and advance, Zhao Zilong's voice shattered the moment:

"Up already? Is Jing'er awake?"

Slamming the door shut with superhuman speed, Guan Yu turned with forced calmness, back drenched in cold sweat. The noise startled Jing'er awake.

Chapter 423: Meeting the Beauty

"Sleep well?" Zhao Zilong inquired cheerfully over breakfast.

"Quite restful," Guan Yu replied awkwardly. "I was checking if Jing'er showed aftereffects from yesterday's trauma."

As Zhao moved to enter the room, Guan Yu hastily intervened: "She's still sleeping. We should wait."

"Ah, right," Zhao chuckled. "My little girl's grown now—no more barging into her room."

Inside, a crimson-faced Jing'er buried herself in blankets, mortified by her forgotten locked door. Guan Yu's village-style wakeup call—"Sun's baking your behind"—confirmed her exposure.

"Stupid brother!" she muttered, pounding the mattress.

At breakfast, Guan Yu requested Li Yuanshan's contacts through Zhao, explaining his departure plans.

"Leaving so soon?" Jing'er appeared, blush fading into disappointment as she joined them.

The meal proceeded with simple fare—soy milk, fried dough sticks, congee, and pickles—as Guan Yu outlined his plans, determined to resolve his energy limitations and confront Lin Dong.
