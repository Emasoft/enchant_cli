The girl finally turned her gaze to Guan Yu. Biting her lip at the question, she declared, “If you save my sister, I’ll serve you as your slave for life!” A faint smirk curled Guan Yu’s lips as she ordered coolly, “Ling Chi. Investigate.” The girl’s face lit with hope, though only now did she properly observe her savior. The young woman wore white robes revealing slender calves, laced boots winding to her knees, and a black whip coiled at her waist. A veil obscured half her face, but the visible features hinted at peerless beauty beneath—though her aura chilled the air like frost.

Soon they arrived at a cramped but tidy hut. Coughs rasped from within. “Die’er…is that you?” A frail voice called. Lu Yi Die (Dependent Butterfly) hurried inside. “Yes, elder sister! I’m back!”

Guan Yu’s group followed to find a bleak interior: chipped bowls, cracked jars, and a narrow bed where a gaunt woman lay. Approaching, Guan Yu studied the sister—a sickly beauty with willow-leaf brows and dim phoenix eyes, her skin marred by angry red marks. Healing? Guan Yu grimaced. Slaughtering enemies she could manage, but medicine? Never her forte.

Turning to Jue and Ling Chi, she demanded, “Which of you can heal?” The assassins recoiled as one. Merciless killers, not physicians! Panicked, Lu Yi Die pleaded, “Please, save her!”

“The capital lies nearby,” Jue suggested. “We could seek healers there.”

Guan Yu brightened—then mentally kicked herself. Had she forgotten her own light magic? Even water elements could cure this! “Ling Chi! Carry her. We march to the capital.”

Grumbling internally, Ling Chi obeyed. Noticing the sister’s bruises, his eyes darkened, but he hoisted Lu Cai Die (Colorful Butterfly) up. She met his scowl with gentle resolve. “I can walk.” Gratefully, he dumped her back. “Suit yourself!”

Jue shook his head, gesturing at Guan Yu’s murderous glare before examining Lu Cai Die himself. “Miss…you’re in that line of work, aren’t you?” Guan Yu blinked, uncomprehending.

Lu Cai Die flushed as her sister tearfully interjected, “She only did it for me!” Still baffled, Guan Yu tugged Ling Chi’s sleeve. “What ‘line of work’?”

The assassin squirmed. “How do I explain…?” His comrades’ smirks offered no salvation.

Studying the bruises anew, Guan Yu suddenly snorted. “Oh. She’s a courtesan. Why the fuss?” The group froze. Only the sisters’ bowed heads acknowledged the truth. Murmurs rippled: their leader’s bluntness was…legendary.

“Survival justifies all means,” Guan Yu continued airily. “Puritan judgments are passé.”

Lu Cai Die stared, then stumbled forward to kneel. “Lu Cai Die pays homage to her master!” Her sister mirrored the gesture.

Guan Yu’s gaze turned arctic. “Master? Prove you’re not useless.”

“We’ll prove our worth!” they vowed. A faint smile touched Guan Yu’s lips.

Their expanded party reached the capital by dusk, finding gates heavily guarded. Guan Yu nodded to Cai Die, who glided toward a leering sentry. “Sir, what’s the occasion?”

His eyes roved her figure. “His Majesty’s banquet draws envoys from all realms. Tightened security.” As she turned to leave, he grabbed her arm. “Where’s my ‘thanks’?”

Cai Die feigned terror while gauging her allies—Guan Yu distracted, others indifferent. Only Yi Die watched helplessly. Resigned, Cai Die slipped a silver needle into his neck. “A mosquito bite, surely?” she simpered, tears sparkling.

Public scorn forced the guard to release her. Returning, she ignored the group’s odd looks. “Master—the Underworld King hosts a banquet.”

Guan Yu stilled. Memories surged. “A banquet… Perfect.”

***

Past the gates, a new crisis arose. “Who has funds?” Ling Chi asked. Blank stares answered. “Master?”

Guan Yu rummaged absently—then dropped a black stone. As she lifted her foot to crush it, Jue lunged. “Stop! That’s a magic crystal!”

“So? I’ve plenty.” She dumped a mountain of glittering black shards. The group gaped. These were extinct demon cores—each worth billions!

At auction, two crystals fetched staggering sums. Guan Yu facepalmed, recalling how many she’d destroyed. “So much wasted gold…”

***

Next day, the sisters alone remained. At Blue Sky Auction House, Guan Yu slapped a crystal on the counter. The appraiser’s sneer died instantly. “V-VIP chamber for you, honored guests!”

“Breathe a word of our presence,” Cai Die hissed, “and you die.”

Bored by lackluster lots, Guan Yu perked up at a blue-glowing flute. “Two million gold.”

A haughty voice countered: “Three million!” A pink-gowned woman sneered—Murong Clan scion, certain of victory.

“Ten million,” Guan Yu yawned.

“Defying the Murongs?!” the woman shrieked.

“The Murongs?” Guan Yu arched a brow.

“Top clan in the Underworld,” Cai Die whispered. “Their genius, Murong Yuhan, is the King’s favorite. His consort Lǐfei is their kin.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. Six years ago, the King had only one queen…

Ignoring the threat, she secured the Frostflute. Its engravings matched her Soul-Devouring Whip’s—a mystery to unravel.

As the Murong woman fumed, Guan Yu smiled. This banquet would be…memorable.
