However, when Guan Yu looked up and saw the personal undergarments drying inside—transparent, semi-transparent, lacy, each piece resembling children's clothing adorned with indispensable cartoon patterns, utterly adorable—he decided to heed Zhang Han's advice and forgo bathing tonight. Returning to his room, he lay directly on the bed and grabbed the thin blanket Zhang Han usually used. A fragrant aroma wafted over, prompting Guan Yu to muse, "Who would have thought this little minx's natural scent could be so intoxicating? Even her bedding retains this lingering fragrance..."

Drifting into sleep, Guan Yu slept soundly till dawn. Upon waking, he found no abnormalities—no visitors during the night. Their plan of lying in wait had failed.

"Why didn't they come? Logically, that person should have appeared last night." Dismissing further speculation, Guan Yu returned to Qiaoyuan District where the gathered women expressed disappointment at the lack of activity.

Over the next two nights stationed at Yang Conghan's villa, Guan Yu still encountered no intruders. Growing suspicious, he wondered: Had their plan been exposed? Were their strategies completely discerned by the opponent?

As someone who maintained light sleep through cultivation practices, Guan Yu would instantly awaken at any disturbance within the villa. Yet these two nights brought neither human intruders nor mosquitoes.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District with snacks for Chang, Guan Yu drove his luxury car to school after breakfast. Now a campus celebrity, he immediately noticed several black Jinbei business vehicles and police cars parked near the school gates.

Police officers descended and blocked Guan Yu's path, drawing curious onlookers. New security guards recently appointed by the principal—part of enhanced management measures following frequent campus fights—emerged to watch the commotion.

"Is this Guan Yu? Heard he's quite the fighter," remarked one new guard, rushing from the security booth.

"Absolutely. He's the most prominent figure at Kaihuang High now," another guard explained.

A striking female officer addressed Guan Yu: "This morning we received reports accusing you of severely injuring Chen Zai's son from Qianjiang Real Estate, causing moderate disability. Additionally, last Friday you assaulted a classmate resulting in leg amputation. Both victims have filed charges. You're to accompany us for investigation."

As the officer spoke, Guan Yu's gaze involuntarily dropped to the woman's prominently displayed bust straining against her uniform. Noticing his brazen stare, the flushed officer thought bitterly: "Trash. Daring to leer so openly! Just wait until we get to the station..."

"Please cooperate with our investigation," she repeated through clenched teeth.

Retracting his gaze, Guan Yu protested: "Officer, have you verified the facts? Since when does filing first equate to innocence?"

"The victims currently hospitalized with moderate disabilities—how could this be fabricated?" The impatient officer produced handcuffs just as Xue Jing arrived.

"What's happening?" Xue Jing inquired.

"Chen Maosheng's family filed false charges," Guan Yu replied calmly, eyeing the business vehicles where he suspected Chen Zai waited.

"Guan Yu acted in self-defense. Many witnesses can confirm this. Please take this call." Xue Jing handed her phone to the officer.

After a brief conversation, the fuming officer glared at Guan Yu: "Don't let me catch you..." before leading her team away.

In a business vehicle, Chen Zai puffed viciously on his cigar: "Brat who dared hurt my son... I'll end you."

As crowds dispersed, new security captain Du Zhao sneered: "Pathetic. Just a gigolo relying on women."

Appointed through principal connections, Du Zhao immediately targeted Guan Yu as his rival. In class, Wei Hongwei proposed forming a gang to counter remaining school bullies like Sun Xu—scion of influential family connections.

Though initially reluctant, Guan Yu eventually approved: "Call it Yu Gang."

After school, Guan Yu's leisurely exit was blocked by swaggering new guards eyeing female students. When confrontational security captain Du Zhao threatened violence, Principal's intervention prevented escalation.

That night, Guan Yu investigated Yang Conghan's villa alone, suspecting housemaid Jinhua—the only other person aware of their plans—after discovering her unexplained deliveries to Zhang Han.

During midnight reconnaissance, Guan Yu planned to uncover evidence of Jinhua's potential involvement, determined to protect Zhang Han while maintaining stealth operations.
