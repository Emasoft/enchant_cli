The man let out a loud cry as the six figures spun around to flee, but it was too late. As they turned, countless shadowy heads surged into the narrow path from the darkness, swaying menacingly under the night sky.

“We’re ambushed!” The man clutching the stun baton finally realized their predicament. Knowing they’d fallen into the Yu Gang’s trap, he tossed his weapon aside and scrambled up the wooden barricade, desperate to escape over the rooftops.

The others followed suit, scaling the structure with surprising agility.

“Fuck your mother! You think you can run? Unless you sprout wings, you’re not getting away today! Smash them!” Jia Bo’s voice roared from the crowd.

At his command, a dozen small dark heads popped up along the rooftops on either side. Each hurled fist-sized stones relentlessly at the six trapped men. The only calm figures were the two between the wooden barricades—Lion King and the short-haired girl—who remained utterly indifferent to the chaos.

As if the narrow path belonged solely to them, they continued their... activities. Annoyed by their audacity, someone on the roof lobbed a rock at Lion King’s back.

“Ow! Goddamn it! Who the hell’s blind enough to hit me?” Lion King barked, glaring upward.

“Can’t you two find a quiet spot? Must you be so desperate?” a voice jeered from above.

The short-haired girl shouted back, “Who cares? I like it this way! It’s more exciting! Got a problem with that?”

Lion King glanced around. The wooden barricades now lay toppled, the six men trussed like zongzi dumplings on the ground.

“Good work today,” Jia Bo declared. “Take these six back for interrogation. Lion King, you and your girl better get dressed and come along. Night winds are chilly—don’t catch cold.”

“Buzzkill,” Lion King grumbled. He and the girl were actually a couple. Tonight’s staged drama, orchestrated by Jia Bo, had successfully lured their enemies into the trap.

This wasn’t Lion King’s first performance. The location, rigged with protective barricades, had finally ensnared their targets.

The captives were dragged to a semi-abandoned construction site in the west district—a failed residential project abandoned years ago after the developer vanished.

Jia Bo’s men hauled the first prisoner into a makeshift warehouse, binding him to an iron frame.

“Talk! Who sent you to target the Yu Gang? Lie, and I’ll pluck your nails out!” A gang member brandished pliers menacingly.

When the captive stayed silent, Jia Bo sneered, “Time to make some noise. Let the others hear what happens to liars.”

Two hours later, Jia Bo called Guan Yu. “Boss, we caught six. They say a ‘Master Cheng’ hired them.”

“Master Cheng? What else?” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy.

“One mentioned Master Cheng has ties to Deputy Director Tian Niu. But they only took his money—don’t know his details.”

Intrigued, Guan Yu arrived at the site. Jia Bo greeted him, gesturing to the hooded, bound figures in the corner. “They’re hired thugs. Aimed to weaken your influence by attacking our members.”

“Weaken me?” Guan Yu scoffed. “Pathetic.”

After briefing Guan Yu, Jia Bo led him to a back room where Lion King fumbled with his pants while his girlfriend hastily covered herself.

“Get decent! The boss is here!” Jia Bo barked.

Guan Yu surveyed the shabby room—a secondhand desk, chair, and worn sofa. “This base is an embarrassment,” he muttered. “We’ll make Master Cheng fund its renovation.”

Jia Bo grinned. “Brilliant, Boss!”

***

Investigations revealed no trace of “Master Cheng”—likely a pseudonym. Guan Yu ordered Jia Bo to bait the employer’s liaison by posing as resentful gang defectors.

As plans solidified, Xie Yulu stumbled in, drunk and berating Jia Bo until noticing Guan Yu. Mortified, she fled after a scolding.

“Control your woman,” Guan Yu remarked dryly.

Jia Bo nodded, refocusing on the mission. The hunt for Master Cheng’s puppetmaster had begun.
