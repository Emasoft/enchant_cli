When Guan Yu arrived at the residence, the Lin family had yet to finish their preparations. Introduced upstairs, Guan Yu naturally hadn't come empty-handed—he brought Lin Qiaoqiao a large bouquet of roses and gifts for her parents.

For her mother, he purchased an autumn coat as the weather turned cooler, while for her tea-loving father, he specially selected premium tea leaves. Though normally strict, Lin Qiaoqiao's parents received their prospective son-in-law with utmost courtesy.

The mother, Zhang Yulian, proved particularly warm. Since their last meeting, she had held Guan Yu in high regard, often inquiring about his relationship with Qiaoqiao during daily conversations. Her persistent approval had gradually deepened Qiaoqiao's attachment to Guan Yu.

"Uncle, Aunt," Guan Yu greeted respectfully upon entering. The family ushered him inside cheerfully.

Qiaoqiao placed the roses on the tea table before accepting Guan Yu's gifts. "Dad," she announced brightly, "Guan Yu brought you premium tea since he knows you're a connoisseur."

Lin Zhonggeng's eyes lit up. "My thanks! This tea looks exceptionally rare—I haven't even heard of this variety! Old dear, boil some water—I must taste it immediately!" The patriarch's satisfaction was evident, pleased by the thoughtful gifts from his future son-in-law.

Turning to her mother, Qiaoqiao presented the coat. "Mom, try this on! Guan Yu chose it for you."

Zhang Yulian chuckled, fingering the vibrant fabric. "This color's too bold for my age!"

"Nonsense! You're as youthful as ever," Qiaoqiao insisted, draping the coat over her mother's shoulders.

Amidst the familial warmth, final preparations concluded. Guan Yu's visit served dual purposes—formal introduction and imminent departure for Qiaoqiao's ancestral homeland in the southern ethnic regions. Tomorrow's martial arts competition to choose a son-in-law would determine her fate.

Lin Zhonggeng had resorted to this ancient tradition after repeated failed attempts to host Guan Yu for a simple meal. Assuming the couple had separated, he organized the contest—a decision now complicated by Guan Yu's belated appearance.

"Dad," Qiaoqiao protested during lunch, "I've always told you we're doing well! Guan Yu's just been occupied!"

"Occupied enough to neglect basic courtesy?" Zhonggeng retorted. "Years pass without a single visit! We thought you'd parted ways!"

Qiaoqiao gestured at their guest. "He's here now! Was this martial spectacle truly necessary?"

"Necessary?" Her father countered. "Which respectable family leaves daughters unwed at twenty? Our traditions demand earlier marriages!"

Guan Yu understood the cultural context—martial arts clans maintained ancestral customs, their timelines diverging sharply from modern society. Unwed women Qiaoqiao's age became subjects of ridicule, pressuring Zhonggeng to act.

"Since Guan Yu's present, can we cancel the competition?" Qiaoqiao pleaded.

"Impossible!" Her father shook his head. "Announcements circulated through all martial factions. Retracting now would shame our lineage."

Qiaoqiao exchanged anxious glances with Guan Yu. The stakes were absolute—victors claimed brides within seven days, regardless of personal merits. Historical precedent demanded compliance, lest families face eternal disgrace.

Zhang Yulian fretted, "We adore Guan Yu, but your prolonged absence made us doubt! Qiaoqiao can't remain unwed—the gossip..."

Zhonggeng added sternly, "We've presented countless suitors! None met your standards! This contest became our last resort."

"Must I be auctioned like livestock?" Qiaoqiao retorted. "My beauty guarantees suitors!"

"Enough!" Her father slammed his cup. "The die is cast. Let Guan Yu prove his worth through combat."

Though Zhonggeng secretly hoped this would expedite their marriage, Guan Yu's uncertain capabilities troubled everyone. Recent revelations about his depleted cultivation skills haunted Qiaoqiao—while she publicly boasted of his prowess, privately she dreaded potential defeat.

"I'll strive to win," Guan Yu offered cautiously, "but make no guarantees."

Zhang Yulian paled. "Husband, cancel this madness! Our daughter's happiness—"

"Silence!" Zhonggeng roared. "Our clan's honor outweighs personal concerns! The contest proceeds!"

Yet conflict warred within him—paternal love versus ancestral dignity. Ultimately, tradition prevailed. "Qiaoqiao understands our ways," he rationalized. "Guan Yu's victory will satisfy both fronts."

As preparations concluded for their southern journey, contrasting scenes unfolded elsewhere. Bill Lin, having failed to recruit the reclusive Elder Xie, turned his attention to the Yang family estate.

Approaching the ancient compound, Bill marveled at its imposing stone lions and weathered walls. The five-meter guardians flanked vermilion doors bearing the carved proclamation: "Yang Residence." Modern cameras incongruously dotted timeworn battlements.

A silver-haired steward greeted them with martial precision. "Master Yang awaits in the rear courtyard."

Traversing the labyrinthine estate took considerable time—front halls led through central pavilions toward secluded gardens. Bill noted the architectural harmony, stonework bearing centuries of weathering. The steward's vigorous gait belied his years, another testament to martial discipline.

"Your presence honors us," the steward intoned, guiding them deeper into the ancestral stronghold. Bill observed every detail—the fifteen-centimeter-thick doors, the strategic layout mirroring imperial temples—aware that within these walls, decisions shaping martial alliances were made.

Thus two threads of destiny advanced—one couple racing against tradition's demands, another power broker navigating ancient halls—all converging toward clashes that would redefine multiple lineages.
