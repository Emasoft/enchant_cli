“Forget it, you go ahead with your work. I’ll just look around casually.” Guan Yu could tell Yang Conghan was busy receiving guests. Tracking her down for the keys when her current location was uncertain seemed troublesome, so he decided against it.

Guan Yu led Xue Jing to the auction house’s backstage—a hive of activity where staff bustled with final preparations. The first item up for bid was a golden Buddha statue, roughly twenty centimeters tall, encased in a glass display under vigilant guard. A middle-aged man in crisp attire reviewed documents nearby, likely the auctioneer. He nodded politely upon noticing Guan Yu.

Recalling the previous host differed, Guan Yu glanced around. Beyond a curtained archway lay the main hall, its muffled chatter audible. The new auctioneer, clearly recognizing Guan Yu, rose as the clock neared nine. “Feel free to find a seat. I must take the stage now—excuse me.” Clutching his papers, he departed.

Guan Yu lifted the curtain’s edge, peering into the hall. As the auctioneer stepped onto the podium, the crowd hushed in unison. From his vantage point, Guan Yu surveyed the room, spotting Second-to-Wolf’s seat. Only one item was displayed initially, suggesting each piece would be fetched post-bid.

Suddenly, the lights dimmed, obscuring Guan Yu’s view. Relying on the podium’s glow, he discerned shadowy figures below. Donning an earpiece, he dialed Second-to-Wolf. “Third seat left of your rear—Sky-Soaring Wolf. He’s likely Bill Lin’s proxy. Can you handle him?”

Second-to-Wolf, also wearing an earpiece, turned unabashedly to observe the meditating Sky-Soaring Wolf. Bill Lin had indeed dispatched him solely to bid on the treasure map fragment, disregarding other lots.

Sky-Soaring Wolf knew the treasure map would be the finale. With time to spare, he rested his eyes. Second-to-Wolf assessed him. “In a duel, no problem. His cultivation seems Second-Class Superior realm, but his discipline’s peculiar—hard to pinpoint.”

“Eliminate him if Mountain-Dwelling Auntie remains unseen,” Guan Yu instructed. “When the map goes up, counter his bids. Stay connected.”

“Understood. Still hunting for Mountain-Dwelling Auntie—she might be disguised.” Second-to-Wolf scanned the packed hall, crowded with corporate agents and treasure hunters alike.

The golden Buddha sold instantly to a rear-seated obese man. As the second item arrived, Second-to-Wolf checked in: “Guan Yu, you there?”

“Listening. Any luck?”

“None. This mob obscures sightlines. She’s definitely camouflaged.”

“Focus on aggressive bidders during the map auction,” Guan Yu advised. “Whoever fights hardest—that’s our mark.”

Two hours later, the auctioneer announced: “Our final item—a treasure map fragment! Minimum bid: ten million. Increments of one million. Begin!”

**Chapter 2683: Hoarse Shouts**

Sky-Soaring Wolf frowned at the displayed map—material and cartography differed starkly from his previous fragment. Hesitating, he called Bill Lin. “The fragment’s authenticity is questionable. Proceed?”

“Different fragments show varied sections!” Bill Lin slurred sleepily. “Bid under fifty million.” The line went dead.

Emboldened, Sky-Soaring Wolf joined the fray at twenty-five million. A portly bidder countered, escalating to twenty-seven million. Sky-Soaring Wolf stunned the room: “Thirty million!”

“Idiot!” Guan Yu cursed through the earpiece. “Flushing Bill Lin’s money recklessly!”

The auctioneer’s voice rasped: “Thirty million! Any advances?”

“Thirty-one million!” The obese man raised again. Gasps rippled as Sky-Soaring Wolf snapped: “Thirty-two!”

Second-to-Wolf intervened: “Thirty-five!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Perfect. His smug face says Bill Lin authorized higher.”

Unbeknownst to all, the obese bidder was Mountain-Dwelling Auntie, disguised via Western Desert poison gu—a blood-consuming parasite enabling flawless metamorphosis. Time pressed her; the gu’s hunger shortened her window.

As bids hit thirty-five million, she bided her time, awaiting the climactic duel between Sky-Soaring Wolf and Second-to-Wolf. The gu’s grip tightened—both on her form and her draining vitality.
