“How could that be? You’re just talking nonsense.” Meimei said discontentedly, never expecting Guanyu to say such a thing. Could she really be unfaithful?

Guanyu secretly chuckled inwardly. Of course she was already being unfaithful—did this require waiting for the future? Heh heh heh.

Yet every word from Guanyu had sunk deep into Meimei’s heart. After a moment of melancholy, she obediently returned to bed.

In her heart, Meimei quietly rejoiced for her younger sister. To encounter such an extraordinary man as Guanyu was truly Shuangshuang’s good fortune—and the Qu family’s as well. She hoped Shuangshuang could truly be with Guanyu. Tomorrow was her own wedding, yet inexplicably, Meimei suddenly felt dissatisfied with her impending marriage, envying Shuangshuang’s luck.

Still unsatisfied, and knowing Guanyu must be suffering terribly sleeping on the hard kang bed, Shuangshuang rose and ran to Guanyu’s side. Leaning against him, she said, “Weird Brother, let me keep you company. Otherwise, you’d surely feel lonely.” Her emotions were profoundly conflicted.

In the span of this afternoon until now, Shuangshuang had already changed Guanyu’s title three times—from Handsome Brother to Naughty Brother, and now to Weird Brother. Truly marvelous—it seemed Shuangshuang was a grandmaster of nicknames.

She had thought clearly: whether they could truly be together in the future mattered less than cherishing this present moment. She would have no regrets. “Weird Brother, do you really want to touch me...kiss me?”

What was this situation? Had this girl reached enlightenment? Was she testing him? Guanyu resolutely uttered one word: “Yes.”

“Then come.” Shuangshuang’s flushed face burned as they entwined together.

The next morning, Shuangshuang awoke first. Turning her head, she saw her fiancé’s peaceful sleeping face and smiled blissfully.

When she suddenly sensed something amiss, she realized a large hand still cupped her proud peak, recalling last night’s events. She felt no regret—this decision had been voluntary. Whether he had several women now or in the future, she would never repent.

Whether they could be together eventually mattered not. At least she hadn’t regretted last night. Even if she could only remain forever as an intimately close younger sister by his side, that would suffice.

Smiling, Shuangshuang moved to kiss Guanyu’s cheek when noises from the neighboring room indicated her parents had awakened. Panicking like a startled rabbit, she leaped back to her own quilted bed—being discovered by her parents would spell disaster.

Her abrupt movements roused both Guanyu and Meimei. The sky paled with dawn’s first light as two roosters outside the Qu residence began crowing vigorously.

Rising, Guanyu smiled at Shuangshuang before stepping out to wash up casually. The household had stirred awake, though both Shuangshuang and Meimei appeared weary—likely from their late night. Guanyu, however, remained unfazed; brief rest sufficed for him.

After a simple breakfast, many helpers arrived at the Qu home. Shuangshuang and Ling’er carried floral wreaths and artificial blossoms to decorate the wedding cars while Guanyu assisted pasting couplets on doorframes.

Meanwhile, Qu Meimei, today’s bride, had spent over an hour applying makeup in her room. Without professional beauticians, a middle-aged woman from the village’s small hair salon served as cosmetic artist—her services customary for most local brides.

Suddenly, firecrackers exploded outside amidst gongs and drums—the groom’s arrival. His procession comprised one sedan followed by a coach bus, arriving noisily at the gate.

Hailing from the neighboring village’s eastern side, the groom’s family was modestly situated. Hiring such transportation for the bride already surpassed typical arrangements—most used farming tricycles.

Alighting, the groom immediately noticed the Bentley parked in the yard. Though no car expert, its luxuriousness was unmistakable.

Clearly, the Qu family had esteemed guests. Spotting Guanyu, the groom instinctively lowered his head in自卑.

Guanyu observed the groom—a decent-looking youth, somewhat slender yet tall, his tan complexion radiating health.

After subsequent formalities, Guanyu drove Meimei away with Shuangshuang riding shotgun, thrilled by the numerous red envelopes she’d receive.

At the groom’s home, crowds thronged a large courtyard hosting forty-odd banquet tables. Though bride and groom should dominate attention, Guanyu’s arrival diverted all eyes to him and his luxury car.

Young women flocked toward Guanyu like mesmerized moths, some boldly offering to bear his children. Protected by Shuangshuang, Guanyu beat a hasty retreat until the Qu family declared him betrothed to their second daughter, quelling the frenzy.

Escorting Guanyu indoors through halls draped in scarlet喜庆decorations, Shuangshuang encountered the village chief’s daughter who tapped Guanyu’s shoulder complainingly: “Where’d you vanish last night? Made me search half the night!”

Nonsense—she’d gotten drunk herself! Naturally, Guanyu refrained, smiling: “I overindulged and found somewhere to sleep.”

The joyous ceremony concluded, Guanyu drove Ling’er homeward. Departing, Shuangshuang wept bitterly, clinging desperately until persuaded by arguments about schooling and her tender age.

After tender reassurances, Guanyu intended to escort Aunt Qing home first, but she opted to stay with relatives. Thus, under the Qu family’s longing gazes, Guanyu departed with Ling’er.

En route, Ling’er suddenly asked: “Brother Guanyu, will you truly accept Shuangshuang?”

Hesitating—having considered this only playfully—Guanyu replied: “If she’s willing, I won’t refuse.”

Shuangshuang’s endearing nature was undeniable. Her charm would shine anywhere, and Guanyu genuinely adored her character. Should she ever come to him, he’d embrace her.

Ling’er felt both concern and joy—worried whether a village girl could integrate with urban elites in Guanyu’s circle, yet glad he’d treat her well. Perhaps separate accommodations would help.

“What preoccupies you?” Guanyu inquired, noting Ling’er’s silent abstraction.

“Nothing—just wandering thoughts.” Exhausted from sleeplessness, Ling’er found the car’s serene interior lulling.

Reaching the city at dusk, Guanyu offered dinner, but Ling’er begged fatigue, requesting to bathe and rest. Dropping her at Pan Tiansheng’s apartment, Guanyu headed homeward when Jones called urgently:

“Guanyu, my men report trouble with Uncle Qing—likely that junior sister’s doing again. She’s brought reinforcements. I’m en route.”

“Understood. I’ll come immediately.” Changing course to Uncle Qing’s residence—fortunately relocated near—Guanyu realized the junior sister had allied with Ma He, the escaped First-Class Adept.

Though Uncle Qing’s snake-venom weakened him, Jones alone struggled against the junior sister’s swarm of clones. Guanyu focused on Ma He, whose Sky-Splitting Fist unleashed crimson energy orbs crackling with lightning.

Guanyu’s shield flared white as the devastating blast shattered trees, blood trickling from his nose. Though severely injured, he stood defiantly while Ma He, nursing rebound wounds, gloated: “Today ends your life, Guanyu! I avenge my brother Ma Hai!”

“Your brother’s cruelty demanded justice,” Guanyu retorted, masking agony. Both adversaries secretly rallied strength for the final clash.

Chapter 2246: Hour of Death

Ma He’s triumphant laughter echoed: “You withstood my strike—impressive for a Second-Class Adept. Pity your luck expires now.”

Guanyu’s body screamed protest, inner energy chaotic. Yet he maintained facade: “You think killing me easy? I survived once—I’ll repeat.”

Nearby, Jones remained ensnared by spectral clones while Uncle Qing faltered under the junior sister’s onslaught. Guanyu’s shield flickered—one more blow would finish him.

Ma He raised glowing fists, savoring victory... unaware of approaching reinforcements. The night’s outcome hung suspended between vengeance and survival.
