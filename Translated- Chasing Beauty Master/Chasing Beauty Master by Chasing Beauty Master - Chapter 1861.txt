“We mustn’t act in haste. We need to proceed steadily. The priority is to ensure we don’t reveal any flaws that could be detected. Only then will the other side not suspect us, and we won’t face significant threats from them.” Master Cao continued, “I know a bandit leader outside the city. Though his men lack exceptional martial prowess, their numbers are sufficient. If you dispatch more forces, Jiang Xin—who has no martial skills—won’t escape. Once captured, we can demand the East Sea Dragon Pearl as ransom through intermediaries.”

“Good. Let’s proceed this way. I can help by tracking Jiang Xin’s movements,” Cao Di suggested. “Knowing his whereabouts will allow us to strike strategically.”

Master Cao nodded approvingly. The key now was to seize the opportunity. Once Jiang Xin was captured, Jiang Yuankai and the Grand Princess—so fiercely protective of their child—would surely surrender the treasure to save him.

The Qin family’s steward, Ma, returned to the estate covered in dust, his face flushed with anger—not at others, but at Madam Qin herself. Earlier, she had dismissed Wan Hong as insignificant, claiming overwhelming numbers would guarantee success. Yet against all expectations, Wan Hong had proven formidable. To ensure victory, Ma had secretly mobilized over a dozen elite fighters from Master Qin’s personal guard.

Now, not only were these experts incapacitated by Guan Yu, but two had perished. The losses were catastrophic. Worse still, Master Qin remained unaware of this disaster. Ma dreaded explaining this debacle—the destruction of years of carefully cultivated talent, the humiliation to the Qin name, all for naught.

“Dismissed. Keep this quiet until I report to the master,” Ma ordered the surviving guards, his voice strained. Some counted themselves lucky for hanging back during the fight, escaping severe injury. The wounded were sent to external clinics for treatment.

Though tempted to confront Madam Qin, Ma reconsidered. She remained his superior, and he’d acted willingly. Resolved, he decided to minimize future involvement in her schemes. Despite lacking martial skills himself, Ma’s decades of experience recognized Wan Hong’s terrifying prowess—a peerless fighter who’d singled out and crippled every expert amidst a hundred opponents. The final two had been slain by a woman’s hidden weapons. This calamity taught Ma they’d provoked someone far beyond their station.

Such skill in one so young marked Wan Hong as no ordinary foe. Perhaps even the mighty Qin family couldn’t oppose him. The beaten Qu Hua’s case would have to be swallowed quietly. Ma’s priority now was damage control with Master Qin.

Madam Qin, learning of the failure, stormed to confront Ma instead of offering solutions. “How did you bungle this?” she shrilled. “A hundred men defeated by one? Are you incompetent?”

Ma’s anger flared at her accusatory tone. Coldly, he retorted, “Madam, Wan Hong’s skills far exceed your description. Few in the entire martial world could rival him. Even our full household guard couldn’t restrain him.”

“You claimed he was mediocre! I brought extra experts as precaution, yet he surpassed all expectations. With faulty intelligence, how can you blame me for failure?”

Madam Qin sneered, “Three-headed demon or not, a hundred men should capture ten Wan Hongs! Your half-hearted effort reeks of collusion! Two elites dead—explain this to the master!”

As she flounced away, Ma seethed. “Heartless witch!” he muttered. Better to confess preemptively to Master Qin, banking on years of loyal service for leniency.

Master Qin frowned over fishing venture accounts. Despite doubling boats to fifty, shipments to the capital had halved. Profits dwindled alarmingly. Had his son Qin Huan mismanaged things? Or was there embezzlement?

A knock interrupted. “Enter,” he called.

Ma entered meekly. “I’ve come to confess, Master.”

“Timely. Explain these discrepancies.” Qin tapped the ledger.

Relieved the topic wasn’t Wan Hong, Ma deflected: “Young Master Huan oversees this. Perhaps seasonal variations?”

Before Qin could ponder, Ma shifted: “Regarding Wan Hong… Madam ordered me to avenge Qu Hua. We took a hundred men, including your elites. But Wan Hong… he’s unmatched. We failed. Two experts died.”

“Fools!” Qin slammed the table. “Attack blindly without intel? Even the Cao family treads carefully around him! You’ve made us laughingstocks!”

Prostrating, Ma pleaded: “Punish this old fool!”

Qin sighed. “Rise. The fault lies with my wife’s rashness. But mark this—until we uncover Wan Hong’s ties to Imperial Son-in-Law Jiang Yuankai, no further provocations! Our losses today are preferable to angering the palace!”
