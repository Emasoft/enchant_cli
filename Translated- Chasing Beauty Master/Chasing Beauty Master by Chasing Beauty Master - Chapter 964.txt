“Young Master Shen had a heated argument with the police officers in his rage. Later, he was arrested, and the entire robot entertainment venue was sealed with official notices.”

“Did you find out which bureau it was? Who led the operation?” Shen Fangcheng demanded angrily.

“We investigated. It was led personally by the newly appointed female captain of the criminal investigation team from headquarters—Lin Qiaoqiao. They stormed in without any warning. Our contacts at headquarters didn’t receive any notification beforehand,” the burly man reported.

Shen Fangcheng took a drag from his thumb-thick cigar. “Damn it! A little bitch dares arrest my son? She’s got a death wish!”

“Boss, we also heard this Lin Qiaoqiao raided us based on intelligence provided by someone named Guan Yu,” another man beside the burly figure cautiously added.

“Guan Yu? Send more men to bring him to me!” Shen Fangcheng ordered. This incident had cost him dearly—the robots were his golden geese, filling his pockets daily with vast sums. Now they were confiscated.

Though reopening through connections and bribes was possible, each day of closure meant massive losses. Calling in favors would require both debts and money. Burning with hatred, Shen Fangcheng swore to tear Guan Yu limb from limb.

Later investigations revealed Guan Yu was under the Yang Family’s protection, leaving Shen Fangcheng paralyzed with fear. Meanwhile, Guan Yu knew arresting so many through Lin Qiaoqiao would provoke powerful enemies.

Fearing for Lin’s safety, Guan Yu spread word that she was his younger sister—anyone harming her would face his wrath.

Many intending to target the new captain abandoned their plans upon hearing this. With Guan Yu and the Yangs backing her, challengers had to weigh their own strength.

Yet some fools still plotted against Guan Yu, particularly the Fang Family. Fang Su’s obsession with Lin Qiaoqiao led him to visit her at the station under flimsy pretexts, earning her disgust.

The Fangs, nursing deep hatred, sought to teach Guan Yu a lesson. Hiring underhanded operatives, they planned covert retaliation.

Now as vulnerable as any mortal, Guan Yu moved cautiously. He hid his lost cultivation, confiding only in Xue Jing at the right moment.

**Chapter 2465: Stunned**

One evening on Qiaoyuan District’s courtyard steps, Guan Yu asked Xue Jing, “Have you noticed anything unusual about me lately?”

Xue Jing nodded. “Your temperament has shifted—it’s like you’ve become a different person.”

“You’re right. Without cultivation, I must approach situations cautiously, hence the change.” Guan Yu lowered his voice. “This secret mustn’t spread. My enemies would swarm like locusts.”

“What?!” Xue Jing’s eyes widened. “No cultivation? How?!”

Guan Yu raised a finger to his lips. “You heard correctly. My power vanished inexplicably.”

Xue Jing gripped his hand, channeling qi into his meridians. Her face paled—his veins had thinned to pinkish threads, organs appearing newborn-fragile. His dantian stood empty.

This wasn’t cultivation loss—it resembled complete bodily replacement. The agony of a grown mind trapped in an infant’s frame!

“What happened?” she breathed.

Squeezing her hand, Guan Yu smiled. “Don’t fret. I’ll live well even like this.”

“But you’re in grave danger! I must tell Elder Sister!”

“No. Outsiders don’t know yet. Let’s avoid worrying them.”

“Then explain what occurred.”

Relenting, Guan Yu whispered, “It began when I retrieved Yingzi’s golden dagger...” He recounted the魔族 (Mó zú, Demon Clan) seal on his memories, the cursed blade’s backlash that erased his cultivation.

Xue Jing’s mind raced—this aligned with his battle against Mo Ya at the Arctic. Perhaps the demon lord’s dying curse caused this?

“The dagger’s contents?” she pressed.

“Likely a Jiezun Relic—the key to breaking my seal. But misinterpreting the demonic incantation triggered the backlash.”

Though omitting details about Jin Hua, Guan Yu’s account held truth. Xue Jing’s heart ached—part of her wished he’d remain this ordinary version, safe in Qiaoyuan’s simplicity.

**Chapter 2466: Your Every Word**

Xue Jing nestled closer. “Promise you’ll take me everywhere now. No more solo risks!”

“As you command,” Guan Yu chuckled, embracing her. Tomorrow, they’d dine with Wei Hongwei—the first test of this new dynamic.

**Chapter 2467: Two Choices**

Morning brought rare unity at breakfast. Zhang Han, ever the gamer, enthused about their online “Beauty Legion” dominating servers. Newcomer Lan Yu blushed at mentions of male fans showering virtual gifts.

“You should webcam-flirt for premium gear!” Zhang Han advised.

Guan Yu scowled. “Flirting online? Am I invisible?”

“Jealous?” Zhang Han retorted. “Join us! Your pretty face could recruit female players!”

As laughter filled the room, Xue Jing reappeared—radiantly dressed. “Ready when you are.”

Guan Yu smiled. This ordinary life, guarded by loved ones, might yet hold beauty. But shadows loomed—the Fangs’ schemes, his vanished strength, and that unopened golden dagger’s secret...
