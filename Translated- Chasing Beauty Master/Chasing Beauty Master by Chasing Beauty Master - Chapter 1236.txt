“But what exactly is happening here? Could it be that Master simply wanted to send Guanyu back?” Siqi dared not inquire further. As long as this matter posed no danger or adverse effects on Guanyu, that sufficed.

Clasping her hands in respect, she replied, “Understood, Master. I shall depart immediately for the Rear Mountain.”

Without delay or preparation, Siqi—ever the obedient disciple—summoned her utmost speed to retrieve Guanyu as instructed. Channeling spiritual energy into flight, she clutched an exquisitely embroidered rectangular pouch she had sewn herself, containing the Jade Ruyi. To conceal its identity, she had spent a full day and night crafting the delicate pouch adorned with a lily blossom.

Now adept at wielding the Jade Ruyi, Siqi marveled at how it had expanded her understanding of immortal cultivation. Its inner dimension astonished her.

**Chapter 3176: Taking a Detour**

Previously, her sword’s hilt had housed a small gem with limited storage for spiritual energy. The Jade Ruyi’s space, however, seemed boundless. The previous night, she had meditated tirelessly, attempting to infuse the artifact with spiritual power until her reserves nearly depleted—yet the Jade Ruyi showed no sign of saturation.

Since bonding with the artifact, it had become an extension of her will, responding to her thoughts like a sentient limb—far surpassing the cumbersome sword. Where once she needed incantations and hand seals to fly or cast spells, the Jade Ruyi now lifted her effortlessly with a mere mental command.

Siqi grew increasingly fond of the treasure. Even when her own energy waned, the Jade Ruyi’s reserves could sustain prolonged battles—a safeguard akin to an ever-present guardian. Activating its stored power required minimal effort, unlike her former sword, which demanded exhaustive rituals for advanced spells.

Now, the Jade Ruyi allowed her to unleash spells instantaneously through thought alone, without vocalized chants or gestures. The only unknown was its capacity limits—though its current reserves already dwarfed her own.

**Chapter 3177: Failed Communication**

Arriving at Beamless Bridge, Siqi hurried toward Tigerhead Peak. Lacking permission to traverse its interior, she circled its outskirts—a tedious detour. Maintaining haste, she channeled energy into her legs, sprinting as Hall Master Dai had commanded.

At the Ancestral Hall, its massive doors remained shut despite her prolonged knocking. Unable to fly or force entry, she waited anxiously. Unbeknownst to her, Elder Jiu and Guanyu were inside a soundproof barrier, laboriously infusing spells into the Emperor’s Seal. Xiaodong stood guard, vigilant against the artifact’s potential backlash.

Elder Jiu, drenched in sweat, finally concluded the day-long ritual, utterly drained. “Guanyu… someone’s at the door,” he gasped.

Guanyu, equally fatigued from mediating with the seal’s spirit, hurried to answer. Outside, an exasperated Siqi confronted him: “Guanyu! Why did you take so long? I’ve waited all afternoon!”

“You’ve been here since noon? I heard nothing!”

Noticing his haggard appearance, she asked, “Are you ill? You look exhausted.”

Guanyu explained their grueling task. “We barely completed one spell. Elder Jiu needs days to recover.”

“Hall Master Dai summons you to Gathering Peak,” Siqi said. “Your friends miss you.”

Suspicious of the hall master’s motives—particularly her interest in his Furnace of Heaven—Guanyu reluctantly agreed. After informing Xiaodong via written note (the mute disciple unable to speak), they departed.

**Chapter 3178: Fear of the Dark**

Detouring around Tigerhead Peak’s forbidding cliffs, they navigated a treacherous path with chain railings—a marvel of engineering Guanyu found absurd. Entering dense woods at dusk, Siqi slowed, uneasy.

“We must avoid attracting beasts,” she whispered, her voice tinged with apprehension. Though a seasoned cultivator, the encroaching darkness unsettled her—a vulnerability even immortal training couldn’t erase.

Guanyu, recalling jungle expeditions far more perilous, remained composed. Yet he matched her cautious pace, understanding a woman’s instinctive wariness of night’s embrace.
