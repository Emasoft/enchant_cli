Guan Yu smiled and said, “If all else fails, I still have my pistol. If that’s not enough, I still have the Emperor’s Seal. Even if I can’t defeat the Swordless Immortal in the end, surviving and returning shouldn’t be a problem. So there’s no need to worry.”

“You’re just trying to placate me,” Wang Xiaorong retorted. “Your Emperor’s Seal only has two spells left, along with the Eight-Drum Technique stored within. Are those two spells even reliable?”

“Absolutely reliable.” Guan Yu gently ruffled her hair and said tenderly, “Don’t worry. With the treasures I possess, I wouldn’t fear even the Demon Lord of Módiē. How could the Swordless Immortal be far stronger than the Demon Lord?”

Wang Xiaorong sighed. “Fine, I know you’re capable. But regardless of what happens, as long as you keep me in your heart, that’s all that matters.”

“Alright, stop worrying about me. Go rest. I’ll head downstairs to speak with that swordsman practicing in the rain. Maybe he knows more about the Swordless Immortal,” Guan Yu said.

Wang Xiaorong nodded obediently, and Guan Yu turned to leave.

Upon reaching the door downstairs, Guan Yu realized there were no raincoats or umbrellas. The downpour outside was relentless—how could he venture out?

After a moment’s thought, he decided it didn’t matter. The weather wasn’t cold, and getting drenched was no concern. He pushed the door open and stepped out, immediately assaulted by the torrential rain. In the distance, the swordsman seemed to notice his approach.

Guan Yu called out with a laugh, “Such dedication, practicing swordplay in the rain at this hour! Are you preparing to challenge the Swordless Immortal?”

The man halted, turning to scrutinize Guan Yu with a displeased expression, as if irritated by the interruption.

Nevertheless, he answered curtly, “Practicing in the rain is a form of meditation. The sound of the storm drowns out distractions, allowing deeper focus. You’re correct—I’ve been here over half a month, honing my spirit to challenge the Swordless Immortal.”

Though visibly annoyed, the man spoke with blunt honesty. Guan Yu remarked, “You’re admirably diligent. Most would find such weather unsettling, yet you persist. But tell me—how confident are you in defeating the Swordless Immortal?”

The man shook his head. “I don’t know. No one in the martial world truly understands the depths of his power. His prowess remains a mystery.”

“If his strength is unknown, why challenge him?” Guan Yu pressed.

Rain cascaded around them as the man stood motionless, sheathing his sword. “Perhaps for purpose. The Swordless Immortal is my aspiration. None have seen his face, witnessed his techniques, or grasped his cultivation methods. Yet he is the world’s foremost martial artist—the ultimate goal. To challenge him is reason enough.”

He glanced at Guan Yu. “You’re young. Do you also seek to challenge him? I advise against it. Those who challenge the Swordless Immortal rarely return. At your age, throwing away your future is unwise. Even if you tried, you’d need decades more cultivation.”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected such disdain. Perhaps the man sensed his diminished inner energy and assumed his cultivation was weak. The assessment, though blunt, was pragmatic. Guan Yu felt no anger—the man’s frankness was refreshing.

With a faint smile, Guan Yu replied, “I’ve no interest in challenging him or claiming titles. I’m merely curious about his legends. If possible, I’d like to meet him—nothing more.”

The man’s eyes narrowed skeptically. “You’re deluded. Countless masters have tried and failed to glimpse his face. Without defeating him, you’ll never see him. You’d struggle to even pass the manor’s guards. Abandon this folly.”

Though the words stung, Guan Yu remained composed. The man’s directness, while harsh, stemmed from concern. Guan Yu sensed a potential ally.

“Thank you for your candor,” Guan Yu said amiably. “I know my limits. May I ask your name? Meeting in this deluge feels fated. I’d be honored to call you a friend—your honesty is rare.”

Ignoring the downpour, Guan Yu added, “Let’s continue elsewhere. Prolonged exposure to rain harms the body.”

The two retreated to the communal dining area, where Guan Yu procured a meal and wine. “Brother, we’ve food and drink! Let’s warm ourselves.”

Guan Yu’s true aim was to glean more about the Swordless Immortal. The man’s obsession with supremacy puzzled him—how could decades of challengers all perish without exception?

The dining hall, though humble, offered hearty fare available at all hours—a small mercy in the exorbitantly priced inn.

“Wine suffices,” the man chuckled, pouring a cup. “To fate!”

They drank deeply. Guan Yu remarked, “This wine is mild—perfect to ward off the chill.”

“I’m Guan Cang. Call me Xiao Cang. And you?”

“Du Teng. Address me as Elder Brother Du.”

“Elder Brother Du, another toast!” Guan Yu raised his cup. After drinking, he asked, “Are you resolved to ascend the mountain tomorrow?”

Du Teng sighed. “Truthfully, no. For half a month, I’ve hesitated—not from doubt in my skills, but fear for my life. Shameful, isn’t it?”

“Not at all,” Guan Yu reassured. “Facing near-certain death would give anyone pause. Why must the Swordless Immortal kill all challengers? A duel needn’t be fatal.”

Du Teng shrugged. “His motives are unknown. Legends say his power transcends mortal limits—he manifests intangible swords from pure energy. None withstand them.”

Guan Yu frowned. “If he’s human, age should weaken him. Yet none know his true face. Even retreating challengers only hear his voice.”

“Only challengers may enter his manor,” Du Teng confirmed. “Merely defeating his guards marks one as exceptional. Most never reach him.”

Guan Yu sighed. “I’ll never meet him, then. But why risk your life for a title?”

“It’s not the title,” Du Teng insisted. “It’s the pinnacle. My cultivation demands this test.”

Guan Yu countered, “If survivors existed, we’d have a ‘second-ranked’ master to challenge first. But the Swordless Immortal’s shadow eclipses all.”

“Precisely,” Du Teng agreed. “No one settles for second best when the ultimate prize looms.”

As they drank, Guan Yu asked, “Who owns this inn? Its profits must be staggering.”

Du Teng laughed. “Another mystery! The owner never appears—three stewards manage everything. Even they guard his identity jealously.”

Guan Yu mused, “Such secrecy… He could walk among us unnoticed. A shrewd businessmind, undoubtedly.”

The pair drank late into the night, their conversation meandering through martial philosophy and the enigma of the Swordless Immortal. Though Guan Yu gleaned little new information, Du Teng’s resolve fascinated him—a mirror to the countless souls drawn to that forbidden peak, lured by glory or futility.

In the end, Guan Yu’s curiosity burned brighter than ever. Somewhere beyond the storm, the Swordless Immortal awaited, his legend a siren call to the ambitious and the doomed.
