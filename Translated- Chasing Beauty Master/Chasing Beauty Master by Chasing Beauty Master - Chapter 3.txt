“Huh…” Guan Yu looked down in astonishment at the wooden stick in his hand. With a bitter laugh, he tossed it aside and approached Mo Ling’s door, knocking gently. Moments ago, she had been shouting threats, ready to fight him to the death. Now she had thrown down her weapon and fled into her room without even giving him a chance to explain!

“Wh-What are you doing?! I’m warning you—I’ll call the police! Get out! Leave now and I won’t press charges!” Though usually acting like a spoiled, willful princess, Mo Ling was thoroughly terrified after consecutive frights. Her preconceived notion had firmly branded Guan Yu as a peeping pervert. Now that he was knocking at her door, she felt utterly panicked.

“Please, listen to my explanation. I’m not what you think—I’m actually—”

“Shut up! Get lost! I’m calling the police!” Mo Ling threatened with a trembling voice.

Slumping against the wall beside Mo Ling’s dorm door, Guan Yu rubbed his nose helplessly. What would he say when his cousin’s wife returned? Would she also think he was such a despicable person? For some reason, this thought made his heart sink deeper into turmoil.

Five or six minutes later...

Mo Ling pressed her ear to the door, darting eyes betraying her tension. Hearing no movement, she finally exhaled in relief, rolling her eyes dramatically. “That scared me to death! Where did that pervert come from? Spying on me using the bathroom—how infuriating!” Her complaints halted as she suddenly remembered Liu Shilei across the hall.

Oh no—had that man entered Shilei-jie’s room already? Could he have...? Mo Ling’s face paled at the thought.

Gulp. After swallowing hard and steeling herself to scream for help, Mo Ling yanked open the door and leapt back two steps.

The hallway was empty. As she cautiously peered out, she spun around—only to find Guan Yu leaning against the wall with an utterly defeated expression.

“Ah—HELP!” Mo Ling screamed, whirling to flee.

“Don’t shout! Let me explain!” Guan Yu slid forward, clamping a hand over her mouth while anxiously glancing around. If others came running, any chance of explanation would vanish!

Mo Ling struggled wildly, raining blows on Guan Yu’s head and face while kicking his shins. “Stop screaming, jiejie! Please listen!” he pleaded, ducking her attacks. When Mo Ling froze in surprise, he seized the moment: “Let’s talk inside!” Still covering her mouth, he guided her back into her room.

Mo Ling nearly fainted from terror. What was he planning?

This chain of misunderstandings gave Guan Yu a splitting headache. “I’ll release you if you stop screaming. Just hear me out, okay?” Mo Ling hesitated, then nodded.

As Guan Yu stepped back, he finally noticed her beauty—rosy lips, fair skin glowing against her beige blouse, eyes clear enough to pierce one’s soul. She resembled an exquisite porcelain doll.

Scratching his head awkwardly before this frightened angelic figure, Guan Yu stammered: “It was all a misunderstanding! I’m Teacher Liu’s younger brother from across the hall. I needed the bathroom but there’s no men’s room here—I’m a new student reporting today!” His explanation tumbled out in disjointed fragments.

After his rambling account, Guan Yu stared at Mo Ling’s silent, wide-eyed face. “Do...you understand?”

She nodded mechanically.

Guan Yu exhaled in relief. “I’m truly sorry. Please don’t dwell on this—I saw nothing!” His placating gestures went unheeded. Seeing her lingering fear, he bowed apologetically. “I’ll leave now.”

Mo Ling watched warily as he retreated to Liu Shilei’s room. Shilei-jie’s brother? They look nothing alike! And he claims he saw nothing? Liar! She stamped her foot angrily, then sighed while patting her heaving chest.

Back in Shilei’s room, Guan Yu collapsed onto the bed with a wry smile. An amorous encounter? That delicate girl’s soulful eyes and melodious voice certainly lingered in his mind. This school overflowed with beauties—even the teachers were stunning.

As he fiddled with a computer, clanging noises erupted from Mo Ling’s room. Peering in, he offered: “Need help?”

Mo Ling glared silently, viciously stabbing at hardened soil in flowerpots with a chopstick. If not for his relation to Shilei-jie, I’d smash his pervert head!

Watching her struggle, Guan Yu stepped forward. “Let me.” He overturned a pot, dumping the compacted soil onto the hallway floor with a thud.

“Done!” He dusted his hands triumphantly.

Mo Ling nearly bit him in fury—she’d wanted to replant flowers, not make a mess! “Clean this up!” she snapped, storming inside.

Baffled, Guan Yu gathered the soil into a bag and tossed it down the garbage chute. Mo Ling reappeared, livid. “Why did you throw it away?! I need that soil!”

“I’ll retrieve it!”

“Forget it! Get fresh soil from the garden!”

Grumbling internally about compensating for his accidental peeping, Guan Yu knelt by a flowerbed. As he scooped soil, a wire pricked his finger. Digging deeper, he uncovered a filthy circular metal object—an ancient copper coin with a square hole!

After failed attempts to clean it, Guan Yu returned with fresh soil. “Left it here,” he announced coolly to Mo Ling’s turned back. Her terse “Thanks” followed him out.

Soaking the coin revealed an immutable black coating. Impatient, Guan Yu stabbed it with scissors—slipping to gash his palm. Blood dripped onto the coin...which began glowing faintly. The grime evaporated, revealing gleaming gold. Before Guan Yu’s astonished eyes, the bloodied coin vanished!

Chapter Seven: The Petty Beauty

“Cursed luck!” Guan Yu tossed the scissors aside, dabbing his bleeding palm. Unnoticed, the vanished coin began emitting faint light—its filth disappearing completely.

Discovering the transformed coin, Guan Yu’s jaw dropped. Spotting Shilei’s drying lingerie above him, he froze—just as Mo Ling reappeared in the doorway.

“Still claim you’re not a pervert?!” she spat, catching him staring at the undergarments.

“I was looking for—”

Their standoff broke as Liu Shilei returned. “Lingling! When did you get back?”

“Shilei-jie, where were you?” Mo Ling shot Guan Yu a warning look as they entered.

“Meet Guan Yu, my—”

“We’ve met. The peep—”

“We just met!” Guan Yu interjected urgently. “Cousin, could you take me to the guesthouse?”

Mo Ling pouted threateningly while Liu Shilei glanced between them. “Did he offend you?”

“He ruined my potting soil,” Mo Ling huffed, sparing Guan Yu full exposure.

Noticing his injury, Liu Shilei fretted over his hand. “Careless with scissors?”

“Serves him right,” Mo Ling mouthed silently behind her.

Guan Yu sighed—this fiery girl seemed determined to be his nemesis. As Liu Shilei examined his wound, the mysterious copper coin’s disappearance weighed on his mind...along with the lingering image of those terrified doe eyes that somehow still captivated him.
