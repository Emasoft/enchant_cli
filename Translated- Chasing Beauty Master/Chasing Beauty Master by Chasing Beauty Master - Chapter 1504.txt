“Of course, there’s still much left to buy. We’ve only just begun. Could you take me to the beast hide shop now?” Guan Yu said to the wizened old man.

"Certainly. Please follow me. I’ve prepared a carriage outside. Let’s travel by carriage."

After exiting, a large carriage awaited them at the main gate of the Midstreet Auction House. Knowing Guan Yu’s close ties to the young master, the old man had arranged this transport.

However, he had momentarily forgotten about Wang Jun standing beside them. Yet Wang Xiaorong showed no displeasure, and the three boarded the carriage together, with the old man urging the horses forward.

As the carriage rolled onward, Guan Yu asked, “I mainly want to purchase high-quality beast hides. Ideally, a place that also sells beast tendons.”

“Of course. Zhouji City’s reputation as a renowned hub isn’t unfounded. One might say if you can’t find something here, it doesn’t exist elsewhere. Whatever materials you seek—if unavailable here—will never be found in other cities.”

After a short journey northward past the auction house, the carriage halted. The old man led them to an unmarked compound with a large gate. “This is the premier place for beast hides—excellent quality at low prices. Most hunters sell their finest catches here.”

Pushing open the gate revealed a spacious courtyard spanning over two hundred square meters, though initially cluttered with what appeared to be mountains of refuse.

**Chapter 3900: Just Name Your Needs**

At first glance, the mounds seemed like trash, but closer inspection revealed them to be neatly processed beast hides, cleaned skulls, and other animal parts stacked in corners—all bloodstain-free and orderly.

A tall middle-aged man stood at the entrance. Spotting visitors, he approached and asked, “Are you here to buy or sell?” His demeanor shifted upon noticing the luxurious carriage outside.

“Please, honored guests, come inside!” the lanky man said with a smile.

Guan Yu observed the man’s effeminate voice and gaunt frame—nearly half a head taller than himself, with sunken cheeks and skin stretched taut over bones.

The old man turned and declared, “I’ve brought our young master to select your finest hides. Only the best—spare us the dregs.”

“At once, at once! Please step inside while I have our goods brought forth,” the tall man fawned. “I’m the proprietor here. Distinguished patrons like yourselves need only command, and we’ll fulfill your every request.”

Though polite, his hospitality felt perfunctory. Other customers—buyers and sellers alike—milled about. Sellers received scant attention, while buyers like Guan Yu’s group were treated like royalty.

Entering the courtyard, the stench of hides and leather assaulted them. Wang Xiaorong covered her nose, trailing behind Guan Yu. Had he not been present, she would have fled immediately.

The outer yard’s chaos gave way to a pristine interior hall suffused with faint floral incense.

“What brings you here today?” the proprietor asked. “Share your purpose, and I’ll recommend suitable materials.”

Without waiting for others, Guan Yu cut in: “Do you have beast tendons? The harder, the better.”

“Certainly! We specialize in hides and tendons—every part of beasts and monsters. Tendons vary: some elastic, some pliant, others iron-hard after processing. Their use determines the best choice. May I ask your purpose?”

Guan Yu avoided specifics. “Where are the tendons? I’ll inspect them first.”

The old man interjected, “Stop dawdling! Bring out everything for our VIPs to choose.”

Wang Xiaorong gestured curiously. “Old One, you know this place?”

“We’ve… had dealings,” the old man admitted cautiously. “Our disciples often sold hunted goods here for silver. A… longstanding arrangement.”

This revelation breached Mohist Sect rules about idle ventures, but the slip forced honesty.

Wang Xiaorong chuckled. “How enterprising! I’ll overlook it this time, but henceforth, all disciples must remain at their posts awaiting orders.”

“Understood,” the old man murmured apologetically.

Recognizing their elevated status, the proprietor barked orders to assistants. “Honored guests, examine these tendons on the left wall. Test any you wish.”

Guan Yu strode over. Rows of nails held tendons of varying lengths. For crossbow mechanisms, he needed supreme elasticity and resilience.

Testing one, he frowned—it hung limp as rope. Several others proved equally unsatisfactory.

“Only these?” Guan Yu turned, disappointed.

“None catch your eye? The right side has finer stock!” The proprietor wrung his hands. “But wait—I’ve sent for our珍藏!”

Though the right-wall tendons sufficed for ordinary crossbows, they paled against what Master Li had already provided. Guan Yu sought perfection—materials worthy of crafting a lightweight, powerful hand crossbow for Wang Xiaorong.

As attendants brought in a half-meter square chest, the proprietor declared, “My personal collection! These will satisfy.” Inside lay coiled tendons—earth tones dominated, but one snow-white strand stood out.

**Chapter 3901: Strange Specimen**

Guan Yu’s hopes revived. The white tendon slipped through his fingers like liquid silk. “Marvelous!” he exclaimed after testing its spring—it snapped back with whipcrack force when released.

“Your discerning eye!” the proprietor praised. “That rarity came years ago from a cloaked stranger selling an entire strange beast. Never seen its like before or since.”

Producing a framed sketch, he revealed a winged monstrosity—triangular head reminiscent of a mantis, body like a giant lizard. “Dare I say… a demonic entity?” Guan Yu mused.

“Demonic? Heavens!” Wang Xiaorong gasped.

“What remains of it?” Guan Yu demanded.

“Only this tendon, a leg bone, and neck hide. The rest sold long ago.”

“Bring them!” Guan Yu ordered. The bone—meter-long and stone-heavy—astounded him. The neck hide, though wrinkled, proved thick and durable.

“Fifty taels for all three,” the proprietor stated.

**Chapter 3902: Delivery Assured**

Guan Yu nearly laughed—a pittance for likely demonic relics. “Contact me immediately if more appear. I’ll take everything.”

Departing with his prizes, Guan Yu calculated: the white tendon alone could craft three micro-crossbows of unmatched power. The bone’s stony density promised an ideal frame.

As twilight approached, Wang Xiaorong asked, “Anything else?”

“No. These will suffice.” Guan Yu’s mind raced with designs. “Let’s return—urgent matters await.”

The carriage rolled homeward, bearing treasures that blurred the line between mortal craft and otherworldly artifice.
