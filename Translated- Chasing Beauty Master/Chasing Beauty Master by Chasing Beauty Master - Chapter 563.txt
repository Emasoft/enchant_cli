“I understand everything perfectly,” Guan Yu thought to himself, though he couldn't voice it outright—he had to preserve the girls’ dignity. Yet being caught between their simmering tension left him deeply awkward. “Thank you for your concern, Chuntian,” he hurriedly replied. “I’ll rest now. Aimi, you and Chuntian haven’t slept all night either. Go get some rest!”

Without waiting for Aimi or Liu Chuntian (Spring Day) to respond, Guan Yu swiftly left with Bikamao in tow.

“Boss, you can’t keep avoiding this!” Bikamao piped up. “A day or two is manageable, but prolonging it will lead to trouble!”

“I know,” Guan Yu sighed. “But what can I do?”

“Honestly, you should just confess your true feelings to them!”

“True feelings?” Guan Yu laughed bitterly. “I don’t even understand what’s in my own heart.”

“Dragging this out will hurt them more. Whether they’re naive or infatuated, both clearly care for you. Aimi sees you as an invincible big brother, while Liu Chuntian leans toward admiration.”

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow at Bikamao’s earnest analysis. “Since when did you become a love expert, you mangy cat? Should I find you a mate to ‘enlighten’ you?”

“A mate? Never! My greatest dream is to stay by your side, sharing your thoughts and burdens. My life is dedicated to serving you, Boss!”

“Enough,” Guan Yu groaned, massaging his temples. “I don’t know what’s wrong with me lately. I’ve never been a womanizer, but now... I’ve lost all interest.”

“Ahem, Boss—you’re ill!”

“Wretched cat! Craving a beating?”

Their banter stretched into the night, deepening their camaraderie.

At dawn, Guan Yu awoke to thunderous noise downstairs. Blinking sleepily, he found sunlight streaming onto his bed.

“Boss, you’re awake! Come see—it’s chaos outside!” Bikamao called from the windowsill.

“Strange. The streets have been deserted since the werewolf attacks. Why the commotion today?”

Curious, Guan Yu joined him. Below, two rows of well-dressed townsfolk lined the inn’s entrance, holding drums and gongs. Crowds flanked them, surpassing even yesterday’s assembly.

“Has the entire Barren Town gathered here?” Guan Yu wondered aloud. “Have they lost all fear of werewolves to parade like this at dawn?”

As he puzzled, Mayor Bade, Xiao Wei (Little Wei), and his mother emerged before the musicians.

“Fellow townspeople,” Mayor Bade declared, “Barren Town has endured centuries of trials, none more devastating than the human-elf war fifty years ago. This very land became a graveyard for thousands, leaving it shunned. Without that war, our town would thrive today!”

His words resonated deeply, especially with elders who’d witnessed prosperity crumble into ruin.

“I speak not to dwell on the past, but to remind you: war destroys all. We must reject it and courageously rebuild!”

Bikamao whispered, “Since when does he spout such noble drivel? It feels... off.”

“Who knows?” Guan Yu shrugged. “But with us here, he won’t dare misbehave.”

“True. But once we leave, will he revert? These people will suffer again.”

“Look at you, caring for the masses!” Guan Yu chuckled. “Don’t worry. I’ll settle everything before departing. If he stays corrupt, I’ll have him removed.”

**Chapter 1426: Commendation Ceremony**

Mid-speech, Mayor Bade sneezed, disrupting his gravitas. “Is someone slandering me?” he muttered, uneasy. “Ahem! Where was I?”

“You said we must honor the past, act in the present, and forge the future!” a voice prompted.

“Exactly! Now, why this speech? Many know two remarkable guests—a man and cat—have arrived. Who knows their purpose?”

Hands shot up. “They’re here to hunt werewolves!” a villager cried. “Heaven sent this duo to save us!”

Upstairs, Guan Yu cringed at “man-cat duo,” while Bikamao guffawed.

“How about ‘Man-Cat Strike, Invincible Might!’?” Bikamao teased.

“Why not ‘Cat-Person’? Matches our werewolf foes nicely.”

“Cat-Person... has a ring!”

“Shut it, furball!”

Below, Mayor Bade continued theatrically: “Last night, while we slept, our heroes braved the forest near the mass graves with thirty youths! They rescued Xiao Wei, confronting even the Murong family’s men! Let Xiao Wei recount their valor!”

Guan Yu frowned. “Xiao Wei was unconscious. What ‘recounting’ is this?”

“Do you trust Bade?” Bikamao asked.

“Trust? He’s greedy but harmless... for now.”

Xiao Wei stepped forward. “I remember little... but I awoke to Guan Yu’s face. He saved my life!”

An elderly woman added, “In seventy years, I’ve never admired anyone as I do Guan Yu! He’s our hero!”

Applause erupted, even from yesterday’s skeptics.

“Boss, your efforts paid off!” Bikamao grinned. “Those instruments are probably your wake-up call.”

As drums and songs erupted below, villagers stormed the inn.

“Landlord! Open up! We’re here for the Cat-Person Hero!”

“Cat-Person? Only Guan Yu stays here—with a cat. He’s asleep!”

“We’ll wake him ourselves!”

Thundering footsteps approached. Guan Yu, half-dressed, glared at Bikamao. “You said you’d guard the door!”

“They’re... enthusiastic!”

The door burst open, revealing a crowd. Guan Yu yanked his pants up as Bikamao sheepishly shut it again.

“Cat-Person Hero! We know it’s you!”

“I’m no—”

Bikamao sauntered out, waving. “Hello there!”

“See! Admit it!” a woman gushed. “So handsome—a fresh-faced idol!”

A plump woman elbowed forward. “He’s mine, you hag!”

A girl sneered, “Dream on, bloated toad!”

Their screeching duel halted when Aimi emerged, yawning. “Dragon Clan Brother, why the noise?”

The crowd gaped. “Dragon Clan? So Cat-Person is a dragon!”

“Dragon-Cat Hero!” someone shouted. “Perfect!”

Guan Yu groaned. “Must this town brand everyone?”

Aimi blinked. “Dragon-Cat Hero... is that you?”

As the crowd debated titles, Guan Yu slammed his door shut, besieged by adoration and chaos.

**Chapter 1427: The Dragon-Cat Hero**

“Boss, need me to handle this?” Bikamao asked as pounding resumed.

“Guard the door! I’m not decent!”

The door exploded inward mid-command. Guan Yu, trousers in hand, cursed. “Useless cat!”

Bikamao hastily shut it. “My bad! They’re... determined.”

Outside, villagers tumbled in when Guan Yu yanked the door open.

“Dragon-Cat Hero! Speech! Speech!”

“I’m no hero. You’ve mistaken—”

Bikamao strutted into view, sparking cheers. “No denying it now!” a man cried.

A burly woman simpered, “So noble! Such a tender youth!”

A rival scoffed, “He’s mine, you walrus!”

Their catfight ceased when Aimi appeared, radiant in sleepwear.

“Dragon Clan Brother?”

The crowd marveled. “His sister’s a fairy!”

“Of course! Heroes have celestial kin!”

“Dragon-Cat Hero! Dragon-Cat Hero!”

Guan Yu facepalmed. “Must they brandish these absurd titles?”

Amid the clamor, he wondered how Barren Town’s fervor would shape their next ordeal—and whether Mayor Bade’s newfound virtue would last beyond their stay.
