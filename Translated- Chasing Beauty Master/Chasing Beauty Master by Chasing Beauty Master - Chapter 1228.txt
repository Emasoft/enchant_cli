This is a cloth pouch that Siqi carried with her. Guan Yu could sense that even this pouch carried a delicate fragrance. Excitedly, he grasped the pouch handed to him by Siqi.

“Guan Yu, since you haven’t mastered the sword flight technique, you might feel afraid in the air. But don’t worry—I’ll protect you. There’s no need to fear,” Siqi kindly reminded him once they reached the courtyard.

Guan Yu nodded vigorously. “I’m terrified of heights, but with you guiding me, it should be much better.”

Siqi smiled. “Let’s go then. Senior sisters, please keep a slower pace. Guan Yu might get frightened.” The two senior sisters behind them nodded in unison. With a few hand gestures to channel their spiritual energy, they rose gently into the air.

Guan Yu thought to himself, *Ah, my dear Siqi is so considerate, slowing down for me. Hehe, this way I can spend more time close to her.*

The two senior sisters flew ahead while Siqi carried Guan Yu behind. All four flew low to the ground. Previously, when Elder Lu had carried Guan Yu, they had soared high above. Perhaps Siqi flew lower and slower to ease his fears.

As waves of her fragrance wafted over him, Guan Yu gazed at Siqi’s elegant silhouette and mused, *Who could have imagined encountering such a beauty here? Not only is she kind and lovely, but she carries an air of chivalry. Back at Convergence Peak, she boldly pleaded for her fellow disciples—a testament to her courage and character.*

The two senior sisters ahead, however, felt like unwelcome intrusions on what should have been a private moment with Siqi. Thankfully, they kept their distance, minimizing the disruption.

“Ah! Help!”

Guan Yu’s grip suddenly slipped from Siqi’s pouch. As he tilted perilously, he cried out.

Seeing him lose balance, Siqi swiftly turned and wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling him securely against her.

Seizing the opportunity, Guan Yu shamelessly embraced her slender waist, relishing the warmth and scent of her embrace. “Oh, thank you, Senior Sister Siqi! I nearly fell!”

Siqi stiffened, startled by his boldness. No man had ever held her so closely. Though flustered, she instinctively pushed him away. “Junior Brother Guan Yu, be careful. I’ll shield you with spiritual energy. You’ll be safe now,” she murmured, her cheeks flushed despite her composed tone.

Guan Yu didn’t take offense. *She’s just unused to closeness. Time will soften her,* he reasoned.

“Senior Sister, I’d feel much safer if you held me like before,” he teased, knowing she’d refuse.

Siqi freed herself from his grasp, her expression cooling. “Junior Brother, propriety matters between men and women. Endure a little longer. We’ll reach Tiger Head Peak soon.”

Land travel would be required thereafter, as sword flight was forbidden there.

Had anyone else dared such liberties, Siqi—renowned as the foremost talent among Yunqing Sect’s younger generation—would have kicked them off her sword. Yet she tolerated Guan Yu, owing to his earlier defense of her fellow disciples and his saving her life. *This must not happen again,* she resolved, though a part of her remained conflicted.

Many male disciples had courted Siqi, only to be driven off. Others schemed to approach her, but she seldom left Convergence Peak, deterring most suitors.

Respecting her boundaries, Guan Yu feigned bravery. “Very well, I’ll endure. But keep a close watch on me, Senior Sister!”

Siqi nodded impassively, enveloping him in a protective cocoon of spiritual energy.

The flight proved swift—a journey that would have taken half a day on foot concluded in moments. Under the night sky, the two senior sisters waited ahead at Tiger Head Peak’s Beamless Bridge, beyond which flight was prohibited.

Without prompting, Siqi took Guan Yu’s hand as they descended. His heart soared—her touch was exhilarating.

“You two are too slow. We must hurry,” one senior sister chided impatiently.

Guan Yu retorted, “Slow? I almost fell! Luckily, Senior Sister Siqi caught me. It was terrifying!”

“What? She…*held* you?” The other sister gaped in disbelief. Siqi, the aloof goddess who spurned all advances, embracing a man?

**Chapter 3,115: Making a Fuss Over Nothing**

The senior sisters exchanged astonished glances. Siqi, known for her icy demeanor, would typically use spiritual safeguards, not physical contact. Guan Yu’s boastful implication—that Siqi was *his*—aimed to deter rivals. By dawn, rumors would spread: *Siqi embraced a man mid-flight!* Guan Yu would become the envy—and target—of every male disciple, but he cared not.

Elder Lu would soon reveal Guan Yu’s status, shielding him from direct challenges. Moreover, with the four magical artifacts gifted by Elder Xuanming and Elder Lu, plus his upcoming training in the forbidden hinterlands, Guan Yu’s fame was assured—a百年难遇 (once-in-a-century) prodigy.

He sought renown, ensuring all knew him as Siqi’s chosen. Let rivals weigh their chances against Yunqing’s rising star.

Siqi, mortified by the sisters’ probing, hurried ahead. The whispers trailing her confirmed Guan Yu’s plan: gossip would ignite tomorrow.

Catching up, Guan Yu feigned innocence. “What are they whispering? Their stares unnerve me.”

Siqi sighed. She knew the rumors would spread, but cared little. However, Guan Yu—still a novice—faced danger if provoked. “Focus on your training in the hinterlands,” she advised. “Its abundant spiritual energy accelerates cultivation.”

“If it’s so potent, why don’t others train there?”

“The hinterlands guard Yunqing’s sacred treasure. Only the Ancestral Hall’s vicinity is rich in energy. The penal caves north of it are desolate and frigid—no one volunteers for that.”

Guan Yu grinned. “I’m to seek Grandmaster Jiu’s aid in imbuing the Imperial Seal with four potent spells. That’ll secure my survival.”

Siqi stared, astounded. Grandmaster Jiu, the millennium-old elder secluded in the Ancestral Hall, rarely intervened—even for sect elders. Yet he’d assist a new disciple?

“He agreed,” Guan Yu confirmed. “Each spell requires days of recovery. All four will take twenty days.”

Siqi studied him, torn between disbelief and envy. The artifacts he bore were beyond any disciple’s dreams.

As they traversed Tiger Head Peak—the sect’s grandest mountain, brimming with spiritual energy—Guan Yu noted its majesty. Siqi had once declined the honor of training here, preferring Convergence Peak’s solitude among female disciples.

Elder Dai doted on Siqi, her star pupil. Convergence Peak, long overshadowed, finally had a talent to reclaim glory. Its gates stayed shut against endless suitors, though sect rules permitted romance.

Guan Yu walked beside Siqi, savoring her conflicted glances. Her frosty beauty, tinged with vulnerability, captivated him unlike any other. The night’s adventure was but the beginning.
