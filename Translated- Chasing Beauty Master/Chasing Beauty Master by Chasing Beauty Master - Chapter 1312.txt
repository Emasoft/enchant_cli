“Second to Wolf had never anticipated the Blood Sect Leader’s formidable strength. Had he known, he wouldn’t have drunk so much earlier. The excess liquor now slowed his movements, leaving him unsteady and faltering at critical moments.

Even so, the combined efforts of Second to Wolf and Guan Yu managed to hold the Blood Sect Leader at bay for a time. Their greatest fear was outside reinforcements arriving during the stalemate.

When Siqi prepared to cast a spell, Wang Xiaorong stopped her urgently. “Don’t use magic! You’ll hurt Xiaotong!”

“Then what do we do? We can’t break these chains!” Siqi cried in frustration.

“Blame that so-called Senior Brother Qi of yours!” Wang Xiaorong snapped. “He must’ve known Xiaotong was chained here all along. Had he told us earlier, we could’ve brought tools. Now we’re stuck watching her right before our eyes yet powerless to save her!”

Xiaotong herself grew increasingly anxious. The Blood Sect Leader had been controlling her these past days, forcing her to ingest something that sapped her strength and sealed her spiritual energy. Her power felt shackled within, leaving her utterly helpless.

Seeing Siqi and Wang Xiaorong’s predicament, the Blood Sect Leader laughed cruelly. “Hah! No tricks left? Did you think rescuing her would be so simple? Those chains were forged from decades of accumulated tungsten-iron! Without the key, breaking them is impossible!”

**Chapter 3384: Two Against One**

“How despicable!” Siqi rose shakily, jade ruyi in hand. “Surrender the key now, or this day becomes your last!”

Rarely had anyone seen Siqi so enraged. The Blood Sect Leader’s eyes glinted covetously at the spiritual artifact she wielded. Guan Yu urgently cautioned, “Siqi, guard your position! Focus single-target spells on him!”

Guan Yu and Second to Wolf redoubled their efforts to contain the Blood Sect Leader, preventing him from nearing the women. If he took hostages now, their rescue would fail utterly.

Sobering through combat, Second to Wolf frowned. “His raw power isn’t extraordinary, but his speed... My blade trails blood-qi with every strike, yet he evades them all. Uncanny!”

Finding his Soulbreaker Blade unwieldy, Guan Yu switched to his trusted dagger—a companion through countless battles. The familiar weight brought fluidity to his movements.

“Guan Yu! I’ll take his legs—you handle the upper body!” Second to Wolf barked. Restricting their opponent’s footwork became paramount against such speed.

The Blood Sect Leader’s attacks carried strange lightning properties. Each clash left Guan Yu’s arms numb and sluggish. “Hah! All flash, no substance!” the villain mocked, now disregarding Guan Yu’s strikes entirely. A hammer swing forced Guan Yu into desperate defense.

As the hammer descended, a searing white sphere from Siqi struck the Blood Sect Leader’s flank. The light-magic visibly pained him, creating an opening Second to Wolf nearly exploited—but the hammer intercepted again.

“Siqi, keep bombarding him! Brother Second, hold firm!” Guan Yu commanded before darting toward Xiaotong. His lockpicking attempts proved futile until he noticed copper filaments woven into her belt’s design.

“Guan Yu! What are you—?!” Xiaotong shrieked as he reached for her waist.

“The copper threads! For the lock!” he explained hastily. The distraction cost them—Second to Wolf took a electrified hammer blow to the shoulder, paralysis setting in as he was kicked aside.

With the frontline broken, the Blood Sect Leader lunged at Siqi. She raised her jade ruyi, summoning a thunderous light-column that struck his skull.

**Chapter 3386: Successful Rescue**

“Damn, why didn’t you use that earlier?!” Second to Wolf groaned, watching the villain collapse. Guan Yu’s concealed pistol smoke still curled from its barrel—an unorthodox solution.

As Xiaotong fainted from shock, chaos erupted. Wang Xiaorong snatched the sect’s golden bat-emblazoned token and vital elixirs from the fallen leader. Detonating the wine cellar brought the mountain down behind their escape.

**Chapter 3387: Inevitable Calamity**

Back in Qujiang City, debates over medical care ceased when they discovered Guan Yu’s wounds healing unnaturally fast. Wang Xiaorong’s feigned nonchalance barely masked her shock—this “automated recovery” confirmed her fears.

“Dual cultivation of martial and mystical energies...” she murmured, mind racing. Such power hadn’t been seen in generations. The implications for her demonic sect chilled her blood.
