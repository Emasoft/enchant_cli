“Guanyu, there’s always room for negotiation. Why resort to such extremes?” Zhang Taiping feigned fear on the surface, though his heart seethed with hatred, silently vowing to teach Guanyu a harsh lesson he’d never forget.

“There’s nothing to discuss. Liu Shuowei clearly deceived you. I’ve long known about your schemes and kept silent out of respect for your position as principal. But now, it seems unnecessary to continue…” Guanyu declared with an air of arrogance.

“Wait—wait! Let’s talk this through. If you keep this matter hidden, name any demand. I’ll fulfill it without fail,” Zhang Taiping pleaded, though inwardly he wished he had a gun to shoot this insolent brat on the spot.

Guanyu had no desire for outright hostility either. His goal today was to force Zhang Taiping to stay away from Pan Xiaoxia. “Stay away from Teacher Pan, and I’ll keep your secrets,” he stated coldly.

“Agreed! I swear I’ll never disturb her again,” Zhang Taiping vowed, compelled to compromise lest his reputation crumble.

Guanyu nodded in satisfaction, thinking, *How dare this old fool covet the woman this young master has set his eyes on? He truly knows no bounds.*

After school, Zhang Han complained about feeling uncomfortable staying at the current residence. Accustomed to roaming freely naked in Yang Conghan’s villa, she now felt shy with Amei constantly around.

“Then I’ll take you back to your aunt’s place,” Guanyu offered earnestly.

“But there are bad people at Auntie’s house!” Zhang Han protested fearfully.
“Don’t worry. I’ve already driven them away.”
“Alright… Take me back now.”

Guanyu drove Zhang Han back to Yang Conghan’s villa in his luxury car—a calculated risk.

Late that night, Guanyu rose fully clothed, having napped briefly while waiting. By sending Zhang Han back, he aimed to lure out the intruder.

*Unless she returns, the thief won’t reappear,* Guanyu reasoned. *This person knows all of us well. What they seek must be on Zhang Han herself. Without her presence, they’ll remain hidden.*

Thus, he had to let Zhang Han take the risk. Parking his car far away, Guanyu channeled his energy to accelerate at maximum speed, reaching the villa in mere breaths.

Sneaking through the corridor into Zhang Han’s room—left unlocked after he’d falsely claimed the culprit was caught—he found darkness shrouding the space behind blackout curtains. Though pitch-black, Guanyu’s night vision allowed him to navigate.

**Chapter 1933: Poisoned**

Zhang Han lay sprawled on the bed, completely naked. Guanyu nearly choked on his own blood, barely suppressing the primal urge surging through him. Locking the door, he retreated into the bathroom.

*If not for needing to catch the thief, I’d be lying there holding her right now…* he mused, steadying his breathing.

Hours crawled by. Around 3 a.m., with no sign of the intruder, Guanyu had already stood vigil behind the bathroom door for three hours.

Finally, ten minutes later, faint metallic clicks echoed—a lockpick sliding into the door. The sound was nearly imperceptible; only by leaving the bathroom door slightly ajar could Guanyu detect it.

White smoke wafted through the keyhole. Guanyu swiftly sealed his acupoints and meridians to block the knockout incense. Ten minutes later, as thick fragrance saturated the room, the door creaked open silently.

Peering through the crack, Guanyu glimpsed a lithe figure clad head-to-toe in black—tight-fitting clothes, face veiled, night-vision goggles masking her eyes. Her curvaceous silhouette—voluptuous chest, slender waist, black-socked feet—confirmed his suspicion: *A woman. No wonder she didn’t harm Zhang Han last time.*

The intruder closed the door softly, removed her gloves, and began groping Zhang Han’s naked body.

*Is she a pervert?* Guanyu wondered, alarmed. When shaking Zhang Han elicited no response, the woman sat her upright, assuming a meditative posture behind her. After tracing symbols in the air, she pressed her palms to Zhang Han’s occiput.

Guanyu lunged out. The woman gasped, scrambling to flee, but Guanyu seized her wrist. With an eel-like twist, she slipped free using bone-contracting techniques.

*Who is she?!*

As her leg swept toward him, Guanyu caught her ankle, tickling her sole. A muffled moan escaped her lips before she wrenched free.

Switching tactics, Guanyu seized her waist from behind. Instead of surrendering, she whipped her head back, spitting silver needles at his face!

Guanyu arched backward, the needles grazing his chin. *A hair’s breadth from disfigurement…*

Enraged, he grabbed her chest—only to recoil as hidden spikes in her leather undergarment gashed his hand. Blood welled as numbness spread.

“Damn! Are you a porcupine?!” he spat, lunging again despite the paralysis. The woman’s poisonous fragrance now filled his lungs—*Another trap!*

Collapsing, Guanyu glimpsed Zhang Han stirring awake despite the knockout drugs. The intruder smirked beneath her veil, fleeing through the window as lights flickered on.

**Chapter 1934: Headache**

Dawn found Zhang Han waking with a splitting headache, horrified to find herself entwined naked with Guanyu. “Bad Uncle! When did you sneak in here…?” she whimpered, too weak to move, drifting back to sleep.

Guanyu awoke later, head throbbing. His blackened, swollen hand confirmed the poison’s potency, though non-lethal. Discovering himself equally undressed beneath Zhang Han’s embrace, he succumbed to exhaustion again.

By noon, Yang Conghan returned to find them thus. Though expecting this outcome since Zhang Han’s infatuation began, the sight of blood on Guanyu’s hand and broken window alarmed her.

“Guanyu! Wake up! What happened?!” she cried, flushing at his nakedness before fleeing the room.

Roused, Guanyu found Zhang Han sleepily groping his arousal. “What’s this hard thing…?” she mumbled, then shrieked upon realization.

Panicking, she sneaked out naked, only to encounter Yang Conghan in the living room. “Auntie! I didn’t know Uncle was here! I slept straight through—”

“Get dressed,” Yang Conghan cut in coldly, hiding her jealousy.

Guanyu, examining the毒针 (poison needles) embedded in the wall, joined them bandaged. Over lunch, he explained the night’s events.

**Chapter 1935: Inconvenient**

“I intentionally sent Hanhan back as bait. The thief—a woman in black—used knockout incense before attempting some energy transfer. I intervened but fell to her poisons.”

Yang Conghan frowned. “And the… aftermath?”

Guanyu shrugged. “The toxins caused temporary paralysis. We both succumbed.”

Zhang Han, devouring her meal, interjected, “But why were we naked?!”

Guanyu coughed awkwardly. “The poison… induces fever. Clothes must’ve been shed instinctively.”

Yang Conghan’s eyes narrowed, suspicion lingering. Yet as Guanyu detailed the fight—the woman’s techniques, escape—her concern deepened. “This isn’t over. She’ll return.”

Guanyu nodded grimly, massaging his injured hand. “Next time, I’ll be ready.”

Unspoken tensions simmered—between the women’s rivalry, Guanyu’s unresolved mission, and the mysterious毒女 (poison mistress) still at large. The game had only just begun.
