“That won’t do! I’m still coming with you! You genuinely care about me! I know…if I follow you, you’ll never screw me over!”

“Staying with these two brothers won’t screw you over either!”

“I just want to follow you! So what? Are you taking me or not?” Niu Le glared stubbornly, his gruff voice tinged with petulance.

Holy crap! In just a few days, this guy had resolved to become his diehard follower? Though Guan Yu knew he possessed some natural charisma and drive, this level of devotion—even willing to drop out together—felt absurdly exaggerated.

“Listen—stay with Wang Zhen and Tian Hao. Study properly here. This campus is full of beauties! Imagine strutting back home during holidays with some stunner on your arm! Wang Zhen’s the expert here. Stick with him…”

“Cut the crap! If I want women, I’d better stick with you!” Niu Le grinned wolfishly, slinging an arm around Guan Yu’s shoulders.

Well…this human adhesive was determined to cling to him. Guan Yu inhaled deeply, feeling an unexpected surge of excitement. Having such a loyal brother to brave this unfamiliar city together might not be so bad after all.

“You’re really decided? Dropping out with me? No discussion with your family?”

“What’s to discuss? I’ve decided!” Niu Le nodded emphatically.

“Alright! Come with me tonight for some business.” Guan Yu tilted his head casually toward Niu Le.

Seeing Guan Yu’s acceptance, Niu Le flashed a toothy grin, swiftly grabbing his canvas satchel to stand solemnly beside his new leader.

“Guan Yu, you’re really ditching us two brothers? It’s barely been days…” Wang Zhen grumbled, eyeing the pair discontentedly.

“Why not drop out with Guan Yu too? All four of us could leave! How’s that?”

Guan Yu gulped audibly, whipping his head around in disbelief. Was this lunatic trying to start a dropout gang? First himself, now dragging Tian Hao and Wang Zhen into this?

“We…um…”

“Plenty of time left! Let’s grab drinks—my treat for a farewell dinner. Don’t mind his nonsense!” Guan Yu hastily waved them along with forced cheerfulness.

The four emerged from the dormitory—Tian Hao looked conflicted while Wang Zhen kept cocking his head thoughtfully. Avoiding Tian Hao’s family restaurant, they entered an upscale hotel near campus.

Inside their private dining room, conversation flowed around everything except Guan Yu’s mysterious withdrawal from school…

Meanwhile at faculty housing, Mo Ling stared blankly at the vandalized sapling, her emotions in turmoil.

“Mo Ling. They say you told Guan Yu to climb that window?” Liu Shilei demanded coldly after investigating, her high heels clicking sharply against the steps.

“I…Sister Shilei, I…” Mo Ling’s gaze darted nervously.

Liu Shilei’s sharp inhale confirmed her suspicions. Despite Guan Yu’s delinquency, even he wouldn’t peep through bathroom windows in broad daylight like some idiot.

“Explain yourself.” The icy command sent Mo Ling slinking back to their dorm like a scolded puppy.

“I…just wanted to teach him a lesson! I never thought…” Mo Ling mumbled miserably, twisting her hands.

“You two have been at each other’s throats since day one! What’s this grudge about?”

“Nothing!” Mo Ling’s heated denial came too quickly.

“It’s not really his fault…but he makes me so angry! I tricked him into twisting that valve, but then those harpies…” Her voice trailed off guiltily.

“You knew those shrews would skin him alive for this!” Liu Shilei snapped. Mo Ling shrank under her usually gentle colleague’s uncharacteristic fury.

Chapter 148: Family Circumstances

Du Xiaojuan shot her aunt Du Wen a venomous glare. Now she understood her father’s vehement opposition—her meddling aunt had clearly poisoned their perceptions.

“I won’t transfer! You’re judging Guan Yu without knowing him!” She retorted, clutching the plush bear Guan Yu won her at the arcade.

“Defending some boy you barely know against family? He’s corrupted you!” Du Wen accused.

“How dare you speak to elders this way!” Her mother chimed in disapprovingly.

Tears welled as Xiaojuan faced their united front. “I’m an adult! Why won’t you listen?”

“What do you even know about him? His family background?” Du Wen pressed.

“That doesn’t matter!”

“It does! His parents can’t put food on the table! You’d throw yourself at this pauper?” Her mother exploded. “Over my dead body!”

Slamming her bedroom door, Xiaojuan peered through the window. Below, two figures waited by stone benches. Her heart leapt—she hastily dangled a toilet paper strip from the windowsill.

Spotting the fluttering white banner from fifth floor, Guan Yu stubbed out his cigarette. Showtime.
