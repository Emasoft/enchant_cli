The manager’s face lit up with joy, nearly rushing to give Mo Ling a bear hug. She had given him another opportunity to boost his sales performance. With a beaming smile, he said, “This ring was designed by Italy’s top master jeweler—the latest model priced at 28,000 yuan, discounted to 28,000.”

“Hmm, get her one then,” Guan Yu waved dismissively.

Rubbing his hands excitedly, the manager replied, “Right away, sir! I’ll handle it immediately.”

As the manager turned to leave, Guan Yu called him back. Unfazed, the manager smiled, “Any other requests, sir?”

“Ah… make it five more of those rings. Six total.” Guan Yu stated impassively, recalling his promise to Wenqing about gifting her something special at the charity gala—a plan ruined by Park Xu. Seizing this chance, he decided to buy them all at once.

But thoughts of Wenqing inevitably brought to mind the three other women at home. He couldn’t show favoritism, especially with Liu Shilei standing right beside him. Five rings total.

“Ahem. Any issue? Not enough stock?” Guan Yu remarked dryly as he watched the manager gape like a fish.

“No, no! I’ll arrange it right away!” The manager hurried off, suppressing the urge to beat his chest in triumph. This month’s sales crown was his! Not only would he get a hefty bonus, but a promotion seemed imminent.

Bystanders stared dumbfounded. This guy was outrageously extravagant—six rings worth over 100,000 yuan plus earlier purchases likely nearing a million total. Who spent money like this?

Soon the manager returned gleefully, carrying six branded bags. “Sir, the six rings total 648,000 yuan.”

“Charge it,” Guan Yu tossed his card nonchalantly.

“Here. Yours.” Guan Yu casually extended a bag toward Mo Ling, who rolled her eyes and snatched it away.

He itched to spank her insolent little bottom—ungrateful wretch after buying her gifts!

Turning to Liu Shilei, he smiled, “Those rings looked nice. Got you one too.”

Liu Shilei studied him deeply before teasing, “And the remaining four?”

“Uh…” Guan Yu scratched his head awkwardly.

With a soft huff, Liu Shilei shot him a sidelong glance but dropped the subject. Guan Yu feigned innocence.

The rude saleswoman who had earlier mocked them stood frozen in shock. She’d let a million-yuan sale slip through her fingers! Regret clawed at her—this could’ve been her ticket to assistant manager. Now it was too late.

“You’re fired. Collect your pay and get out,” the manager’s icy voice cut through her despair.

“Manager, please give me another chance!” she begged.

“Your incompetence nearly cost us this deal. No second chances. Get lost,” he snapped coldly.

Pale as death, the saleswoman sighed in resignation and slunk away—the architect of her own downfall.

……

In the jewelry store’s surveillance room, three plainclothes men monitored the screens. A monkey-thin man rubbed his hands excitedly, cackling, “Big fish tonight, boss! Look at those bags—must be worth millions! Rich brat for sure. Extra bonus coming our way!”

His barrel-chested companion grinned, “Kidnap him and extort his old man. Better than robbing this gold shop.”

“Why stop at one? Let’s take those two chicks too. Look at those faces and asses—playtime!” The thin man leered, drooling.

The average-built leader checked his watch with a sinister smile. “Old Fourth’s crew will arrive soon. Showtime.”

Chapter 483: Gold Shop Heist

Liu Shilei emerged the night’s biggest winner. What started as a simple shopping trip for Guan Yu’s clothes had brought unimaginable surprises.

What woman doesn’t love beauty? Even Liu Shilei was no exception.

As the crowd dispersed, most being ordinary salaryworkers like herself who could only window-shop, Guan Yu suggested, “Getting late. Shall we head back?”

Before anyone could move, a voice rang out: “The night’s young, friends. No need to rush.” Armed men flooded through the doors, guns trained on the crowd as the security shutters descended—sealing their fate.

Guan Yu’s expression hardened. This was a well-planned heist. Discreetly dialing his phone, he pulled the women behind him, analyzing the six gunmen’s positions. Their professional movements and disabled cameras marked them as seasoned criminals.

Abandoning resistance, Guan Yu prioritized the women’s safety. The manager’s attempt to hit the alarm ended with a silenced bullet through his chest.

Screams erupted until another shot dropped a bystander. “Next screamer dies!” the leader barked. Silence fell like a guillotine.

“Good. Now empty your valuables—phones too. No tricks.” As henchmen collected loot, one reached Mo Ling.

“Don’t touch me!” she shrieked.

“Feisty bitch. Pretty face won’t save you.” The leader aimed.

Time slowed as Guan Yu tackled Mo Ling, taking the bullet in his arm. Blood dripped onto her ashen face.

“You’re shot!” she gasped.

“I know. Stay calm,” he gritted through pain, activating his healing system just enough to staunch bleeding.

“Touching,” the leader sneered. “But you’ll both—”

“Wait!” The thin man from surveillance emerged. “This brat’s loaded—bought millions in jewelry! Ransom his rich dad. And these chicks…” His lustful gaze raked over the women.

The leader hesitated. “Make it quick. Cops’ll notice the closed shutters.”

As the pervert reached for Liu Shilei, Guan Yu snarled “Back off!” before breaking the man’s arms and crushing his groin. A gun pressed to his temple froze further action.

“Kill him!” the castrated man howled.

The leader cocked his weapon. “Money vs. my brother? You die.”

“What about fifty million? A hundred million?” Guan Yu bargained coolly.

A bank check revealed 50 million yuan in his account. “Transfer it,” the leader demanded.

“Need secondary password,” his lackey reported.

“Give it, or watch your women die.” A shot tore through Guan Yu’s thigh.

“One… Two…”

“Enough! I’ll tell!” Guan Yu yielded.

The leader smirked victoriously. “Thought you could outsmart me? Pathetic.”
