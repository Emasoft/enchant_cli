The roar of dragons and tigers flashed momentarily as a Demonic Sect Golden Core cultivator suddenly screamed, violently pulled by tremendous suction. Before he could react in panic, he was dragged hundreds of meters away.

“Trouble! Ambush! Brother Kuang, save him! Uh... Xiao...”

Two Nascent Soul-level demonic cultivators reacted first. Yet before acting, they sensed a wave of bloody energy assaulting them. Dizziness struck as black and purple light erupted from their bodies—Nascent Soul cultivation couldn’t be overcome by mere blood poison. But as they prepared to strike, thousands of Blood Godlings surged toward them, forcing them to defend.

*Thud.*

Within half a minute, the Golden Core expert who’d been seized appeared before the crowd as a corpse—limbs twisted, tongue lolling, eyes bulging like a frog with a broken neck, his death grotesquely peculiar.

“To receive without reciprocation is discourteous. Brother Yin, don’t blame me...” Guan Yu’s voice boomed across the sky, silencing the previously mocking crowd. Though the slain wasn’t the strongest here, his mid-Golden Core cultivation had been extinguished shockingly fast—a mere half-minute despite the ambush.

“Wake up! What’s wrong with you? Weren’t you all swaggering earlier? You shame the Demonic Sect!” The Kuang-named demonic cultivator’s thunderous shout jolted the group awake. The remaining seventeen Golden Core cultivators exchanged ashamed glances.

“Brother Kuang, look here.” The other Nascent Soul expert calmly pointed to clues left behind. “Observe the fist marks on this youngster’s opponent. The victim should’ve been injured.” As leaders chosen for their excellence, they quickly deduced Guan Yu had paid a price for his swift kill.

“So Guan Yu is injured?” Yin Qianjun exhaled deeply. Guan Yu’s appearance felt unrecognizable—slaying a mid-Golden Core cultivator instantly was terrifying. Since Yin himself was only mid-Golden Core, if Guan Yu could kill flawlessly...

“Of course he’s injured! Rest here tonight. Brother Kuang and I will set up protective arrays. Reflect on your disgraceful performance—act like elite Demonic Sect disciples!” The Nascent Soul cultivator berated them, authority unquestioned in the strength-worshipping Demonic Sect.

The group dispersed silently into factions. Selected from the Three Holy Sects and minor sects, they’d seen this mission as an opportunity—now it felt like a descent into hell.

**Chapter 1210: Countdown to Killing**

“Brother Yin, what’s Guan Yu’s background? Give us the truth.” Seven from the Yin faction clustered around Yin Qianjun, seeking survival through camaraderie.

“Brother Qin, no need for formalities—you’re practically family. Guan Yu’s strong, but together we’re unassailable. Today was a fluke—stay vigilant.” Yin Qianjun wished he knew more, but Guan Yu’s capabilities from three years prior were irrelevant now.

*Boom!*

The surrounding arrays trembled as bloody shadows surged. Golden Core cultivators paled, visions hallucinatory.

“Guan Yu! Show yourself, coward!” A burly demonic cultivator roared, charging out with twin hammers.

“Pull him back!” The Nascent Souls moved to intervene but froze—restrained by bloody energy.

“Greetings again, Demonic friends.” Guan Yu materialized mid-air, his wild appearance no longer laughable.

“Vermillion Bird Sword Intent: Wildfire Scorching the Plains!” His purple sword trembled, igniting fierce flames that condensed into a two-meter fiery bird. Crimson swordlight engulfed the Demonic Sect’s arrays.

“Well met! Heaven-Shaking Hammer!” The hammer-wielder laughed, conjuring a massive spiritual hammer to smash Guan Yu—while retreating toward the array.

“Letting you leave would disgrace me! Stay! Seven Stars Sword Divine Ability: Celestial Pivot!” Purple swordlight flashed as Guan Yu vanished. The hammerer’s eyes widened fearfully yet he spun his weapons into an impenetrable shield—halting his retreat.

*Clang!*

The purple streak pierced through him, leaving a bloody “II” on the ground as Guan Yu’s laughter faded. The decapitated corpse with severed hammers radiated despair, chilling observers.

If the first kill was ambush, the second proved Guan Yu’s lethal prowess. Sixteen remaining elites felt death’s breath—their privileged futures now hanging by Guan Yu’s whims.

“Elders, why didn’t you intervene? Are our lives worthless?” Another core disciple accused the Nascent Souls.

“Blaming us for your weakness?” Xue Wuya sneered. “Guan Yu commands a mid-Nascent Soul Blood Asura. Without our restraint, you’d all be dead!”

“Elder Xue, Brother Fish only seeks clarity,” Yin Qianjun mediated. “Rest tonight. We depart tomorrow,” Elder Kuang declared decisively. Guan Yu’s prowess—mid-Golden Core yet rivaling Nascent Souls—was abnormal.

“Are we truly retreating?” Xue Wuya muttered不甘ly.

“No. He’s marked us. Demonic Sect’s price is blood,” Elder Kuang’s eyes darkened. Accepting defeat would breed inner demons.

**Chapter 1211: Counter-Trap**

Next day, the Demonic Sect retreated disheveled but vigilant. Guan Yu and Blood Asura “Old Xue” observed coldly.

“Old Xue, thoughts?” Guan Yu smiled, cross-legged. These were his prey—two Golden Cores mere appetizers.

“Trap. Though most are dispirited, Kuang won’t leave humiliated. I felt his stubbornness yesterday.” Old Xue relaxed—the Demonic Sect had already lost, confronting Guan Yu’s mobile sanctuary advantage.

“Let’s entertain their trap. Make them fear,” Guan Yu’s eyes glinted dangerously. Only pain would deter future threats.

Old Xue departed respectfully. Guan Yu’s fearless confidence—backed by capability—commanded loyalty.

Soon, Xue Wuya nodded at Elder Kuang.

“Ready defenses! Brother Fish, Yin Qianjun—begin preparations. Brother Kuang, it’s yours.” Xue Wuya drew a curved blade as rumbling approached—a horde of demonic beasts led by bloody shadows.

“Fleeing?!” Old Xue’s Blood Godlings swarmed but met a black net reinforced by Yin Qianjun’s purple light and Fish Xuansong’s blackflame.

“Net of Ten Thousand Bugs? Profound Darkness Flame? Child’s play!” Old Xue scoffed as insects clogged the net. Though anxious for Guan Yu, he focused—this was mere distraction.

**Chapter 1212: Battling a Nascent Soul**

Elsewhere, Guan Yu faced Xue Wuya—a blood-drenched figure oozing carnage.

“Demonic elders trapping a mere Golden Core? Overkill. Imagine losing face if you fail,” Guan Yu taunted.

“No delays. You die now!” Xue Wuya’s crescent blade arced toward Guan Yu’s neck as a bloody palm strike closed in—an inescapable Nascent Soul assault.

Guan Yu remained calm. Three moves—that was the agreement with Qin Wuliang. If he survived, Whale Three would intervene.
