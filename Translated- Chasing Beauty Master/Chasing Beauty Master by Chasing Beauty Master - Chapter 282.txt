Because of Liu Shilei, Guan Yu found it inconvenient to stay overnight at the villa. His own villa had been bombed, making it difficult to find new accommodations immediately. He had already instructed Luo Cheng to find him a new place as soon as possible, but until then, he and Liu Shilei would likely have to spend their days in hotels.

The phrase "nightly revelry" perfectly described Guan Yu's current sex life, and tonight was no exception.

After showering, Guan Yu emerged from the bathroom wearing nothing but a bathrobe.

As he closed the door, the lights in the presidential suite suddenly dimmed. Guan Yu's nerves immediately tensed. He activated his detection system and shouted, "Shilei!"

His tension was understandable. With the rise of his influence, those who wanted him dead would follow. Hadn't he experienced numerous assassinations over the past six months?

Therefore, when the room lights suddenly dimmed, his first thought was that someone was trying to ambush him.

Guan Yu pushed his detection system to its limits, scanning the darkened room with eagle-like eyes. Suddenly, he froze, mouth agape, retracting his detection system in shock.

Instead of enemies, he was greeted by a sight that sent lustful flames surging through his body, nearly making his nose bleed.

A slender figure leaned against the door opposite him. Though her face was unclear, Guan Yu recognized Liu Shilei by her silhouette. What drove him wild was that Liu Shilei wore nothing but black lingerie and stockings - the provocative kind that accentuated every curve.

What was happening today? First Feng Xin unexpectedly declared herself the "Western Palace Consort," and now Liu Shilei appeared before him in seductive lingerie - completely unlike their usual dynamic.

Though confused, his raging hormones pushed aside doubts. He assumed Liu Shilei was simply spicing up their intimacy.

His instincts told him more was coming. Suppressing his animalistic urges, he waited.

True to expectation, Liu Shilei began moving.

She braced against the door, extending her right leg sideways. Black lace clung to her thighs, revealing only slivers of pale skin. The contrast of white flesh against black temptation under dim lighting further inflamed Guan Yu's desires.

Her movements continued. She straightened her right leg, toes pointed delicately. Then she bent her knee, licked her upper lip, and blinked seductively at Guan Yu. Though slightly awkward, the gesture was devastatingly effective.

Even after countless nights of passion, Guan Yu had never experienced such direct provocation. His eyes turned bloodshot, breathing ragged.

Watching Guan Yu's discomposure, Liu Shilei's smile widened.

To fan the flames, she lowered her leg and swayed towards him, hips undulating. She draped an arm around his neck, breathing softly against his ear until he could feel her warm breath. As their bodies touched, her stocking-clad leg rubbed against his calf while her free hand traced patterns on his back.

After prolonged teasing, Guan Yu finally groaned in pleasure - the sensation was unbearably stimulating.

When the provocation reached its peak, Liu Shilei suddenly broke away and locked herself in the bedroom, leaving Guan Yu frustrated and unfulfilled.

After cold showers and manual relief failed to quell his urges, the exhausted Guan Yu eventually succumbed to sleep.

Come morning, Liu Shilei crept from the bedroom only to be caught by a red-eyed Guan Yu who proceeded to ravish her repeatedly until noon.

Exhausted but satisfied, Liu Shilei nestled against Guan Yu's chest. When questioned about her motives, she revealed her true purpose - to address Guan Yu's growing harem, particularly his unresolved tension with Feng Xin.

"Since you already have Wenqing and Du Xiaojuan," Liu Shilei said with a knowing smile, "why hesitate with Feng Xin? Or perhaps... Gao Wei?"

Her mention of the latter name sent Guan Yu's heart racing. How did she know about Gao Wei? Though their encounters had been few, each had been memorably intense - particularly one cold night when they'd shared a bed after nearly drowning.

Faced with this confrontation, Guan Yu chose honesty: "There might be... some feelings."

The admission hung in the air as both contemplated the complex web of relationships surrounding them.
