However, the glass cover appeared exceptionally sturdy, likely bulletproof glass. The inner area had a door, presumably leading to another room, though its contents remained unknown.

Qi Zhi tentatively inquired, “Young man, are you the shop attendant here?”

“Yes. I’m my master’s apprentice, managing this pawnshop for him daily. You could say I’m the attendant,” the young man replied honestly.

Hou Jinshun observed the youth—under thirty, with a round face pockmarked by acne scars and a robust build. He seemed ordinary, and Hou’s scrutiny confirmed he wasn’t a cultivator. What could he possibly learn from his master?

Qi Zhi voiced Hou’s unspoken question: “Young man, is your master the owner of this pawnshop?”

“Yes.”

“What have you been learning from him?” Qi Zhi pressed.

The youth resumed wiping the counter with a cloth. “Mainly appraising antiques and artifacts. My family couldn’t afford schooling, but years ago, I met Master. He took me as his disciple after seeing my passion and aptitude for these things.”

“Oh? So your master is an antique connoisseur. I suppose nothing escapes his discerning eye?” Qi Zhi probed.

“Pretty much. Master can determine authenticity at a glance. He often pinpoints an item’s era and purpose,” the young man declared proudly.

Hou Jinshun chimed in, “Remarkable! Few possess such skills nowadays. Most rely on instruments, but your master’s expertise is unparalleled.”

Qi Zhi nodded. “Counterfeiters grow increasingly sophisticated. They mix ancient materials into fakes, fooling even machines.”

The apprentice boasted, “In all my years with Master, he’s never misjudged an item. His assessments are infallible.”

“Astounding!” Qi Zhi praised, matching the youth’s enthusiasm. “How much have you learned under him?”

“Only superficial knowledge. I struggle with unfamiliar objects,” the young man replied modestly.

Through their brief exchange, Hou noted the apprentice’s deep reverence for his master.

Qi Zhi stood and retrieved a circular jade pendant from his collar. “Young friend, appraise this for me.”

Eager, the youth wiped his hands and examined the pendant with budding expertise.

**Chapter 2843: The Youth**

The pendant resembled a ring—deep emerald, flawless, and translucent despite its dark hue.

After scrutiny, the apprentice remarked, “I can’t assess the jade’s quality, but its age is evident. The ancient engravings are too weathered to decipher.”

Qi Zhi smiled. “Keen observation. This heirloom dates back generations, passed down with our family records.”

Hou joined the inspection. Qi Zhi pressed, “Your shop acquired a piece of leather for a million recently. Is it truly so valuable?”

The youth retreated to cleaning, avoiding the topic.

Qi Zhi reassured, “We mean no harm. We wish to purchase it.”

Relenting, the apprentice shared, “Master bought it. I thought it worthless, but he deemed it precious. Its current status? Ask him.”

Stalemated, they waited. Time crawled until ten o’clock, when a lean, white-bearded man in his sixties entered—the master, exuding seasoned authority.

**Chapter 2844: Too Many Troubles**

“Master, these guests have been waiting,” the apprentice announced.

Old Wu scrutinized the duo. “Do you have business here?”

“They’re here for the leather,” the apprentice added.

The old man’s eyes narrowed. “State your intentions.”

Qi Zhi bowed. “We seek to negotiate fairly.”

“My surname is Wu. Sit.”

Inside a windowless backroom, Qi Zhi cut to the chase. “May we see the leather?”

Old Wu refused. “Name your price first.”

“We heard you paid 1.5 million. What’s your asking price?”

“Twenty million,” Wu stated.

Hou gasped. Qi Zhi excused himself to call a contact: “He demands twenty million. Should I proceed?”

“Insane! Confirm it’s the real map first!” the voice snapped.

Returning, Qi Zhi negotiated, “My financier requires proof.”

Reluctantly, Old Wu opened a biometric safe, revealing a glass-encased leather fragment—ancient, palm-sized, etched with faded symbols.

**Chapter 2845: Borrowing Money**

“Here it is. For earnest buyers, I’ll consider lowering the price,” Wu conceded, prioritizing safety over profit.

Qi Zhi examined the relic. The treasure map’s fate now hinged on a precarious deal, where trust was as fragile as the aged parchment itself.
