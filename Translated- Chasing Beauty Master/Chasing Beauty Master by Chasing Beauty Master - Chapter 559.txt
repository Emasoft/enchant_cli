As Guan Yu furrowed his brows in deep thought, Bade beside him was secretly delighted. However, he dared not show it on his face. Standing beside Guan Yu, he feigned a sigh and said, “Ah, Young Master Guan Yu, didn’t I tell you your methods wouldn’t work here? Look at this crowd—who wouldn’t lose patience dealing with such people day after day? You must understand the hardships I’ve endured all these years!”

Guan Yu shot Bade a sidelong glance. “What does this have to do with you extorting protection fees?”

“This… Young Master Guan Yu, what’s gotten into you today? You keep mentioning protection fees. How can we remain friends if you persist like this?”

With a swift leap, Bika Cat landed beside Bade. “Foolish brat, who said anything about being friends with you?”

“Well… I know you won’t stay here long, but as the saying goes, ‘More friends mean more paths.’ I’m only thinking of everyone’s benefit…”

“A fine sentiment,” Bika Cat retorted, “but unfortunately your ‘path’ leads to a dead end. Whether there are more or fewer makes no difference.”

Outargued, Bade fell silent. As the crowd began dispersing and Guan Yu contemplated giving up, a voice suddenly rang out: “Wait! Don’t leave yet! Hear me speak—just one sentence! I won’t stop anyone from leaving afterward!”

The crowd quieted, turning toward the speaker—a man in his seventies. Though others might not recognize him, Guan Yu knew him well: Liu Yishou, who had arrived with him.

“Boss, what’s Old Liu up to?” Bika Cat whispered.

“Not sure. Let’s watch and adapt,” Guan Yu murmured.

Liu Yishou climbed onto a raised platform in the square, surveying the crowd. “Good people, you’ve all heard of the recent monster attacks, yes?”

“Heard it was wild boars!” a youth scoffed. “Nothing to fear. Let them come—I’ll make sure they never return!”

Before the echo faded, another countered, “Ignorant whelp! Not boars—ferocious mountain dogs! Each weighs three hundred jin, built like tigers with jaws like blood pools!”

Guan Yu inwardly groaned. What nonsense! Are all in this town mad? Is there no sensible soul here?

“I know him!” someone shouted. “That’s Liu Yishou!”

“The street performer? The one with the gorgeous granddaughter I’ve dreamed of marrying!”

“Keep dreaming! Liu Chuntian’s beauty would be wasted on the likes of you!”

“Wasted? More like a flower stuck in dung!”

“You’re the dung! Your whole family’s dung!”

As the quarrel escalated, Liu Yishou roared, “Enough! Look at you—shameful! The monster isn’t boar or hound, but a werewolf!”

“Wolf…?”

“Not wolf—werewolf! A hundred times deadlier! Understand?”

The youths quieted under Liu Yishou’s intensity.

“Werewolves?” A nonagenarian snorted. “Ninety years I’ve lived, never heard such tales! You’re just fearmongering!”

“What’s your game, Liu? Trying to marry off your granddaughter through this chaos?”

“Will you take this seriously?” Liu Yishou pleaded, flustered until a voice called out: “Old Liu’s right! I saw the she-wolf near the outer alleys! Many witnessed it—a beautiful female werewolf!”

“Ha! Spinning tales now? A beauty? I’d gladly taste a she-wolf!” a lewd voice jeered.

“Shameless!”

As absurdity mounted, Guan Yu intervened. “Since you refuse cooperation, I’ll be blunt. Liu Yishou spoke truth, but I’ll add this—multiple werewolves exist. If they attack en masse, Barren Town faces annihilation!”

“Why should we trust you? How do we know you’re not conspiring with these ‘werewolves’?”

“Exactly! You might be one yourself!”

Chapter 1416: The Last Straw

“If you’re allied with these monsters, we’re all doomed!”

Exhausted, Guan Yu turned to Bika Cat. “I’m at my limit. Take over.”

“Wait! He was there when we saw the she-wolf!” someone accused, pointing at Guan Yu.

The crowd erupted. “So you’re that rogue!”

“No—he’s with the wolf-woman! Old Liu’s accomplice!”

As tempers flared, the crowd jeered at Bika Cat’s small feline form. “What’s this? A kitten? Not even wolf-like!”

“More like stray cat than hound!”

Bika Cat’s fur bristled. With a thunderous roar that shook the square, the “kitten” transformed into a colossal dragon, scattering the mob like leaves. When the dust settled, the cowed crowd gaped at the mythical beast.

Guan Yu himself stared in shock—this was the same dragon illusion from his duel in Elvenwood. So it had been Bika Cat’s doing all along!

As the dragon form dissipated, Bika Cat addressed the trembling crowd: “I warned you. Try fleeing, and I’ll blow you back like tumbleweed!”

Seizing the moment, Guan Yu declared, “We’re here to save you, not harm you. Mark this!”

The stunned silence broke when a disheveled hunter stumbled into the square, babbling of a wolf-headed monstrosity devouring rabbits in the woods. Skepticism turned to terror as details emerged—two dead, one injured, one missing.

“See?” Bika Cat smirked. “They won’t shed a tear until they see the coffin.”

Guan Yu questioned the hunter. “Where exactly did this occur?”

“Near the mass graves… I think…”

“The mass graves again?” Guan Yu muttered. That accursed place!

A wail pierced the air as a crone clutching Guan Yu’s legs. “My son! My only child! If he’s gone, I’ll die too!”

The hunter interjected, “Auntie, Xiaowei’s missing, not dead! We got separated fleeing!”

Hope reignited, the crone begged Guan Yu: “Find my boy! I’ll support you forever!”

The tide turned. “We’ll follow your lead, Master Guan!” the crowd chorused.

“Then listen well,” Guan Yu commanded. “I need thirty volunteers to search the woods. The rest—prepare defenses!”

Hands shot up. “Me!” “I’ll go!”

Chapter 1417: Follow Me

After selecting his team, Guan Yu approached the hunter. “You’re certain about the werewolf?”

The man nodded. “Saw it clear—wolf head, bloodied jaws. My friends… they…” He shuddered.

“And the location?”

“The mass graves area. Couldn’t mistake it.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened. To Bika Cat, he murmured, “Ready weapons. We move at dawn.”

As volunteers gathered supplies, the crone grasped Guan Yu’s hand. “Bring my Xiaowei back. I’ll pray to every god…”

“We’ll find him,” Guan Yu promised, though unease gnawed his gut. Somewhere in those cursed woods, a pack of nightmares waited—and this time, diplomacy wasn’t an option.
