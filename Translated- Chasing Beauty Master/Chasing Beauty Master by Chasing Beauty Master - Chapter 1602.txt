“The Manor Lord is correct. The number one manor in the world shouldn’t be measured by its size but by its overall strength.” Du Teng’s words carried a hint of flattery as he continued, “No one dares challenge your capabilities. Even if your esteemed manor had merely ten members instead of over a hundred, other factions wouldn’t dare show disrespect.”

“You overpraise me,” replied Wu Jianxian (Swordless Immortal), clapping his hands lightly. “These are but empty titles. My entire life has been devoted to martial studies. I’ve cultivated for decades, possessing nothing but this reputation. Truthfully, I care little for fame—my obsession lies solely in martial arts.”

At his signal, a servant entered. Wu Jianxian chided, “Our guests have waited long enough. Where is the tea?”

Wang Xiaorong had been wanting to mention this very point. After their arduous journey outside, thirst clung to them all. The others shared her sentiment, eagerly anticipating refreshment.

Soon, a servant arrived with teacups for each person. Wu Jianxian’s mask—crafted with an opening at the mouth—allowed him to sip without removal. Guanyu observed the weathered mask, wondering if it had clung to the man’s face for decades, never removed, never revealing the features beneath. Even the manor’s servants remained ignorant of their master’s true appearance—whether concealed due to hideousness or other reasons remained a mystery.

Studying the Swordless Immortal’s hands and exposed jawline, Guanyu noted the man’s surprisingly youthful bearing. By all accounts, Wu Jianxian should have been nearing a century old given his decades-long reign as the world’s foremost martial artist. Yet he appeared no older than forty—a vigorous middle-aged man defying time’s touch.

Internal energy cultivators might enjoy extended lifespans, some reaching two hundred years, but aging remained inevitable. This stood in stark contrast to immortal cultivators, whose profound arts slowed aging dramatically. The discrepancy puzzled Guanyu. How did a mere martial artist maintain such youth? Unless...

His musings were interrupted as Wu Jianxian raised his cup. “Forgive our humble hospitality. Please, drink.”

Wang Xiaorong reached thirstily for her tea, but Guanyu subtly restrained her. Only after watching their host sip first did he permit her to drink. A quick inspection revealed no poison—unnecessary when their host could overpower them openly. Du Teng and Zhenxiang drained their cups immediately, parched from their trials in the peach forest maze.

As the last drops vanished, Wu Jianxian’s tone shifted. “One matter perplexes me. Why risk storming my manor? Surely you harbor deeper motives.”

“We meant no offense,” Guanyu explained carefully. “Your fame compelled us to witness the legend ourselves. We lack the audacity for formal challenge, hence... unconventional entry.”

Zhenxiang blurted, “They say all challengers perish here. True?”

“Decades as the supreme master—how many have you slain?” Wang Xiaorong added recklessly.

Guanyu shot them warning glances. Such bluntness courted disaster. The masked figure remained unreadable as he responded, “My martial arts target vital points—swift, lethal strikes leave little room for mercy. I never desired endless challengers. The burden wearies body and soul.”

He gestured wearily. “Eventually, I trained servants to filter challengers. Only those surpassing my retainers earn the right to face me. Thus, the unworthy turn back... or die trying.”

“So it’s not disdain, but necessity?” Guanyu pressed.

“Precisely. My techniques kill within ten moves. Through years, this culled reckless challengers. Few dare come now.” The Swordless Immortal sipped again, shadows deepening in his voice.

Du Teng ventured, “How many challengers remain nowadays?”

“Far fewer. Tales of death deter the foolish.” The reply carried grim satisfaction.

Wang Xiaorong suddenly swayed, clutching her head. “Guanyu... so dizzy. Need rest...”

Zhenxiang staggered too. Guanyu whirled on their host. “Poison? How vile!”

Wu Jianxian’s laughter turned metallic. “Soft Body Powder renders energy cultivation useless. A day’s helplessness—convenient, no?” His posture shifted, menace radiating. “Two immortal cultivators here... curious. State your true purpose.”

Guanyu’s mind raced. Even Du Teng struggled against the toxin’s grip. “We sought only knowledge. The renowned Number One proves a cowardly trickster!”

“Cowardice preserves life.” The false immortal circled them. “Your precious Xiaorong—the Demon Lord’s darling. Normally, none would risk his wrath. But I?” He leaned close, mask glinting. “What’s a demon patriarch to me?”

Guanyu forced a smirk. “He’s acquired a Nascent Soul guardian. Still so confident?”

“Lies!” The impostor sneered. “No mortal commands such power.”

“Who said the guardian is mortal?” Guanyu’s retort hung sharp as blades crossed.
