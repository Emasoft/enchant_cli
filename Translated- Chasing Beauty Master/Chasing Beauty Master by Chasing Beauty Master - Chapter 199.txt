Bai Jie was in high spirits, inwardly rejoicing at his earlier persistence. Had he stormed off earlier, he would never have discovered that Guan Yu's woman wasn't Gao Wei. This meant he still had a chance. After such a resolute declaration earlier, surely Gao Wei couldn't remain completely unmoved? Not only did he have an opportunity, but a considerable one at that.

Yet his smile soon froze on his face.

"Hmph, who'd bother lying to you when they're full?" Gao Wei retorted irritably. "Husband, let's go shopping. This person's annoying me."

With that, Gao Wei linked arms with Guan Yu's other side.

"T-two women?" Bai Jie stood dumbfounded as if witnessing the most inconceivable phenomenon in the world. He refused to believe it—utterly refused. How could such a thing be credible? Yet the undeniable reality before him chipped away at his disbelief.

The world had changed—or gone utterly mad. Mad enough to render it unrecognizable. Two women calling the same man "husband," one of them being a major celebrity? His entire worldview had been overturned today.

Even Guan Yu himself could scarcely believe his eyes. Did Gao Wei need to go this far?

"What? Let's go!" Gao Wei shot Guan Yu a sidelong glance. Her current agitation rivaled when she'd first acknowledged being Guan Yu's woman. Why had she acted so impulsively today?

Du Xiaojuan merely chuckled nearby, showing no jealousy at Gao Wei's sudden inclusion. Guan Yu already had plenty of women—what difference did one more make? As long as he remained faithful to her, she couldn't care less.

Under Bai Jie's envious gaze, Guan Yu departed with a beauty on each arm.

"Hey, wait for me! We finally meet acquaintances—take me along!" Bai Jie hurried after them. "Buddy, you're legendary! Alright, I admit I underestimated you before."

Celebrities were human too, and Bai Jie proved this by trailing behind Guan Yu like an eager puppy. His motives were twofold: first, to confirm whether Gao Wei truly belonged to Guan Yu; second, if she did, to thoroughly reacquaint himself with Guan Yu and learn his "techniques."

......

Their quartet became the street's main attraction. Not only was Guan Yu flanked by two stunning beauties, but the man following them was devastatingly handsome too. People of all ages and genders cast curious glances their way.

Currently, only Gao Wei held Guan Yu's arm. Having two peerless beauties clinging to him would draw even more attention, and Guan Yu had no desire to become a public spectacle.

Du Xiaojuan had released his arm both to avoid shocking onlookers and to help drive away their persistent follower—perhaps also harboring secret hopes of uniting Gao Wei with Guan Yu. Though no longer physically connected, her affectionate demeanor toward Guan Yu remained unchanged.

"Hey buddy, how'd you pull this off?"

"Hey pal, greed isn't virtuous."

"Hey Weiwei, a man who can't stay devoted isn't reliable!"

Bai Jie's ceaseless chatter accompanied their entire journey. This wasn't a superstar—it was a motormouth! Guan Yu found himself thoroughly exasperated.

The world overflowed with eccentrics—killers who didn't act like killers, celebrities who didn't behave like celebrities. Guan Yu suddenly recalled Lin Dong, that utterly unprofessional assassin. Maybe these two would find common ground.

A wicked grin spread across Guan Yu's face.

Suddenly, his peripheral vision caught a hidden figure snapping photos with a DSLR. Alertness sharpened his features. "Someone's taking sneaky shots."

Gao Wei paled. Years of experience told her this was paparazzi. If photos of their intimacy leaked, her peaceful days would end. "Where? Can you seize his camera?"

Guan Yu, unfamiliar with entertainment industry tricks, pondered briefly. "Yes."

"Then why aren't you moving?" Gao Wei urged.

"You need to let go first," Guan Yu replied wryly. To intercept swiftly, he needed sudden acceleration—impossible with Gao Wei clinging to his arm.

Blushing, Gao Wei released him and avoided his gaze. A sudden gust whipped her face as Guan Yu shot forward like an arrow from a bow.

Though fast, the paparazzi proved quicker. As Guan Yu charged, the man stashed his camera and shouted: "Quick! It's Gao Wei and Bai Jie!"

The stars' popularity dwarfed anything Guan Yu could imagine. At their names, the crowd swiveled toward Gao Wei's group. Confirming the sighting, they surged forward like blood-crazed sharks.

The human tsunami blocked Guan Yu's path. He could only watch helplessly as the paparazzo escaped with his camera.

Guan Yu, who neither chased fame nor followed entertainment news, now witnessed firsthand the terrifying scale of Gao Wei and Bai Jie's popularity. Despite their oversized sunglasses, sharp-eyed fans recognized them instantly. Pedestrians converged from all directions, their numbers swelling by the second. Frenzied screams erupted as the trio became trapped in a human vortex.

"Gao Wei! You're even prettier in person! I adore you!"

"Sign my autograph, Weiwei! I'm your biggest fan!"

"Look! Bai Jie! So handsome! OMG!"

"I've dreamed of this moment! Today I must hug my prince charming!"

......

Guan Yu inhaled sharply at the chaos. Were looks alone worth such madness? He couldn't comprehend this star-chasing mentality.

Noticing Gao Wei's pained expression in the crushing crowd, Guan Yu realized the danger. At this rate, she'd be trampled flat. Worse, opportunistic hands might take advantage. While he appreciated her beauty, he wasn't some hormone-driven predator.

After phoning Police Chief Nie for reinforcements, Guan Yu plunged into the throng, muscling through bodies toward the epicenter.

Gao Wei felt panic rising. Though accustomed to crowds, this complete loss of control was unprecedented. Her shouts for space drowned in the sea of voices. Even front-row fans wanting to comply couldn't resist the backward press of bodies.

Her clothes wrinkled, forehead glistening, Gao Wei maintained her smile through forced handshakes.

Bai Jie fared no better. His stylish outfit hung in tatters, face smudged with grime—a far cry from his usual suave image. He prayed for police intervention before being crushed alive.

"Move! Move!" Guan Yu initially believed his strength could part the crowd, but underestimated their frenzy. Halfway through, sweat drenched him.

Enraged, he roared: "SCRAM!"

The explosive shout froze nearby spectators. Before they could protest, Guan Yu grabbed a 180-pound man's collar and hoisted him airborne. "I said SCRAM!" he coldly declared, hurling the man into the crowd. Bodies collapsed like dominoes.

Gasps erupted. This young man's brute strength defied belief—a veritable berserker!

(Using his gravity system secretly, Guan Yu enhanced his power beyond normal limits.)

Surveying his handiwork, Guan Yu announced: "Anyone else blocking my path will share his fate." His murderous glare swept the crowd, sending shivers down spines. People hastily retreated, forming an impromptu corridor.

Satisfied, Guan Yu strode forward. Occasional challengers met identical fates—hurled aside like ragdolls. Through this human bowling, a path emerged revealing Gao Wei's disheveled form.

Noticing reduced pressure on her right, Gao Wei stumbled sideways but caught herself. Bewildered, she looked up—and froze.

A half-meter clearing had appeared. Standing at its end stood Guan Yu—equally rumpled, sweat-drenched, wearing an earnest, slightly goofy smile. His disheveled state spoke volumes about the effort expended to carve this path.

Warmth flooded Gao Wei's heart. Then Guan Yu's expression hardened. Activating his gravity system, he bulleted toward her, encircling her waist and yanking her close just as a pervert's hand reached for her backside.

**Chapter 494: Scandal**

Within milliseconds, Guan Yu's kick bent the groper's wrist at ninety degrees. The man's agonized scream pierced the air, his face contorting with pain and hatred. As he tried fleeing, Guan Yu—still holding Gao Wei—lunged forward, delivering an uppercut that launched the offender airborne. The crowd erupted in applause for this brutal ballet.

"Dare lay hands on her? Know your place!" Guan Yu coldly addressed the crumpled pervert, ignoring the cheers.

The fans initially applauded the spectacle, unaware of the pervert's intentions. Upon realization, their admiration turned to fury. Their goddess nearly defiled! The mob's wrath descended on the would-be molester.

Meanwhile, Gao Wei experienced emotional whiplash: touched by Guan Yu's rescue, startled by his sudden ferocity, then indignant as his lingering embrace became obvious. His hand now rested on her derrière!

"Are you hurt?" Guan Yu asked gently.

"Yes!" she hissed through clenched teeth.

"Injured where?"

"Your hand's position!"

Guan Yu followed her glare. During the scuffle, his hands had migrated—one still encircling her waist, the other cupping her bottom. He jerked back as if burned.

"Ahem... emergency measures," he stammered, scratching his head. "Had to stop that pervert."

Gao Wei's glare could melt steel. Saved from one pervert only to be groped by another—twice in one day! For someone rarely touched by men, this was intolerable.

Beneath her withering stare, Guan Yu could only grin awkwardly. Explaining he'd simply enjoyed her soft curves seemed unwise. Best maintain silence before getting slapped.
