Everyone in the organization knew Meiyu kept five polar bears. These were no ordinary polar bears—even five Upper Third Realm cultivators wouldn't be their match.

Moreover, no one truly understood Meiyu's own strength. All they knew was that her cultivation level stood immeasurably high.

Under the dual pressures of her formidable power and breathtaking beauty, over eighty percent of the men in the organization devoted themselves wholeheartedly, content to earn even a single word of praise from her.

If all her suitors were stacked upon each other, the pile would reach the height of a television tower. Yet despite this sea of admirers, she showed interest only in Guan Yu.

Jiang Fenju mustered his courage to approach her. “Boss, why must you recruit Guan Yu? Our organization has no shortage of capable hands. Even without him, we’d still prosper.”

Jiang Fenju counted himself among her pursuers. This boldness might earn him a scolding, but he resolved to endure it.

To his surprise, Meiyu watched silently as Guan Yu’s figure vanished around the street corner before sighing. *If he regains his memories one day, will he remember me?*

Ignoring Jiang Fenju’s question, she ordered, “Withdraw everyone.”

None dared disobey. Yet Meiyu’s heart churned with conflict. *Guan Yu... No matter what it takes, I’ll make you stay by my side—mine alone.*

Who was Meiyu? If Xue Jing saw her, he might recognize her as Jones, the woman once left in the ice cavern.

The five polar bears were the very cubs Xue Jing had adored. Now transformed, Meiyu’s appearance had grown more alluring and sensual.

Jones had arrived with vengeance. After Guan Yu and Xue Jing abandoned the ice cavern, she remained with the cubs, absorbing the abundant spiritual energy and the power released upon Moyan’s death.

She’d expected to wait eternally for Guan Yu’s return, until fate intervened.

The cubs seemed ordinary until danger struck. They suddenly grew twice the size of adult polar bears. Together with Jones, they defeated the intruder.

Uncertain why powerful enemies sought the cavern, Jones fled with her bears.

Her love for Guan Yu burned fiercely—she desired him exclusively. Gathering supernatural forces, she built today’s Free Organization.

Even Jones couldn’t explain her transformed appearance. Emerging from the cavern, her reflection startled her—this face had become her own.

Now, Jones no longer existed. Only Meiyu remained, heartbroken by Guan Yu’s refusal to regain memories. Learning of his whereabouts drew her to City A.

Yet relentless reports tortured her—Guan Yu acquiring new women: this tycoon’s daughter, that clan’s heiress. The news drove her mad.

Her temperament turned icy, her methods ruthless. Though knowing capturing Guan Yu’s friends would anger him, she proceeded regardless.

She’d hoped to showcase her achievements—to prove herself as the woman all men adored, second only to emperors.

But Guan Yu’s arrival revealed a truth: No status or power could elevate one beyond insignificance before him.

Meiyu’s actions aimed solely to seize his attention. She vowed to make him hers alone.

**Chapter 1918: Encounter in the Woods**

Unaware of Meiyu’s machinations, Guan Yu rescued Qian Yaoyao. Though Wei Hongwei gratefully reunited with his girlfriend, Qian remained sullen—her ordeal stemmed from Guan Yu’s affairs. Yet her man’s ironclad friendship with Guan Yu left her trapped, praying such incidents wouldn’t recur.

Next day, Guan Yu attended class—or rather, slept through it. Ignoring the increasingly beautiful Pan Xiaoxia, he drooled on his desk while Lü Mei grumbled nearby: “Sleeping like a hog! Can’t even glance my way. Hope you never wake up!”

Lü Mei found him utterly unromantic. Oblivious, Guan Yu snored on.

Now enjoying unprecedented freedom, Lü Mei could accompany Guan Yu anywhere without bodyguards. At lunch, Xue Jing remarked: “You’re the luckiest here.”

“I envy you living with him,” Lü Mei retorted.

Xue Jing scoffed: “He barely comes home! When he does, he clings to Ah Mei. An old woman like me? He’ll toss me out someday.” Guan Yu smiled wordlessly—her grievances were justified.

Post-lunch, Guan Yu strolled with Lü Mei through the campus grove—a verdant paradise mixing towering trees with quaint pavilions. The area hosted myriad activities, its lawns occasionally littered with used condoms despite diligent cleaning. Today, the woods buzzed with unusual crowds.

“Waited long for you, Guan Yu.” Chen Maosheng emerged smugly. Guan Yu despised these delusional troublemakers.

“Scram, mutt. Not in the mood.”

“Think your taekwondo title makes you invincible?” Chen sneered as Qunhao Society members encircled them—nearly a hundred strong.

“Leave Lü Mei, and we’re square,” Chen demanded.

Guan Yu assessed the threat—numerous cultivators among them. Protecting Lü Mei complicated matters.

The Qunhao Society had ballooned under Chen’s leadership, funded by his lavish spending on salaries and brothel outings. Today, he’d mobilized everyone for this ambush.

Lü Mei spat: “I’d never choose you!”

“Shut up! Today’s about settling scores!” Chen brandished a dagger from the crowd’s safety.

As attackers charged with clubs and metal pipes, Guan Yu shielded Lü Mei within a glowing barrier, incapacitating foes with brutal kicks. Twenty fell before Chen attempted a sneak attack.

Guan Yu disarmed him, embedding the dagger into Chen’s thigh. The would-be leader’s screams halted the mob.

“Next attacker shares his fate!” Guan Yu roared. Silence fell.

**Chapter 1919: Foothold**

Chen’s threat—“Kill him and lead Qunhao!”—tempted a few cultivators. They lunged, but Guan Yu disarmed one, snapping the steel pipe.

The crowd wavered, reminded of life’s value over false glory. Guan Yu’s aura of lethality dissolved their courage.

Chen’s earlier teachings echoed hollowly now: *To dominate campus, we must overthrow Guan Yu.* But bloodied reality proved otherwise.

Guan Yu stood unbroken, Lü Mei safely at his side. The grove’s shadows deepened with the Qunhao Society’s shattered ambitions.
