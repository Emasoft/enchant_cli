Hou Jinshun owed Guan Yu a favor from previous assistance.

After the two police officers walked away, Hou Jinshun's phone rang—it was Guan Yu calling. Hou knew Guan Yu was nearby in a Volkswagen Beetle.

Upon answering, Guan Yu ordered, "Once the ambulance arrives, arrange hospital transfers for the injured. Keep them under tight surveillance. Have Lin Qiaoqiao take that blond-haired punk back too." Without waiting for a response, Guan Yu hung up.

Hou Jinshun strode forward and kicked the scrawny youth in the lower back, sending him sprawling face-first onto the pavement. Witnessing this, Qian Yunqing roared triumphantly, "Evil finally meets its retribution!"

Lin Qiaoqiao, fully aware of the blond troublemaker's notoriety, ordered her subordinates to haul him into the police vehicle. The youth thrashed and screamed, "Who the hell are you?! Dare arrest me?! Do you know who's backing me?! Your careers are finished!" Despite his struggles, two officers crammed him into the car.

Turning to Lin Qiaoqiao, Hou advised, "Extracting evidence for prosecution will be simple—just interrogate the injured." Nodding in understanding, Lin told Qian Yunqing, "Your internet café's damages will be compensated. Stay home and await updates—no need to take matters into your own hands."

Qian blinked in surprise. Expecting victimization, he hadn't anticipated police assistance. Though Lin's face seemed familiar, he couldn't place her. "Can you really recover my losses?" he asked skeptically.

"Every last penny," Lin affirmed, noting Qian's simple honesty.

"Thank you! But...aren't you with those other officers? Why help a stranger?"

"Tonight you were both unlucky victim and fortunate beneficiary. Save your thanks—direct them to his boss instead." She gestured at a limping man nearby.

Both the limping man and Qian exclaimed simultaneously, "Guan Yu?!"

"You're from the Yu Gang?" Qian asked.

The man nodded. "Normally we'd be at tonight's assembly, but my leg injury kept me back."

"I must return to duty," Lin interjected. "Calculate your losses and contact me later." She drove off as ambulances arrived to transport the wounded.

Assuming the night's chaos had concluded, Guan Yu prepared to disband Wei Hongwei's forces when Jones urgently called: "Guan Yu! Our scouts report hundreds blocking Qiaoyuan District's main street! I'm en route—where are you?!"

"What?!" Guan Yu roared. "I'm returning NOW!"

Xue Jing sped toward Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu fuming at the Feng family's audacity to provoke him here. Upon arrival, they found the street completely barricaded—"Unless we fly in," Xue remarked dryly.

Alarms blared from Guan Yu's villa, its unaware occupants needing reassurance. The broad, mile-long Qiaoyuan Street—lined with mansions—normally enjoyed heavy security with frequent patrols and surveillance. Tonight, however, five hundred rioters surrounded Guan Yu's compound.

Emerging from the car, Guan Yu surveyed the sea of faces. "You court death tonight," his voice cut through the din, freezing the crowd. "This shall become your nightmare."

Chapter 2649: All Cannon Fodder

Amidst the shouting mob, fifty guards held the villa's entrance. Guan Yu and Xue Jing stood alone until two figures emerged—Ge Yinglai and Sun Xu.

"Did Bill Lin's empty promises embolden you?" Guan Yu sneered. "You gravely underestimate me."

Ge frowned at Guan Yu's lack of reinforcements. "Your time here's over, Guan Yu. Crossing Young Master Bill was your fatal mistake."

Sun Xu jeered, "Enough talk! Show us what you've got!"

Guan Yu's gaze turned glacial. "You overestimate yourselves. These five hundred ants can't warm up my guards." He knew Bill Lin sent these pawns to test his defenses, coveting both his territory and Xue Jing.

As engine roars approached, Guan Yu smirked. "Bill Lin sacrificed you as cannon fodder. Let's see what trash he's thrown at me."

Ge Yinglai panicked at approaching vehicles. "ATTACK NOW!" he bellowed. The mob surged forward as Xue Jing drew her Desert Eagle.

Jones arrived first, joining Xue Jing in shielding Guan Yu. Though overwhelmed by numbers, they retreated methodically until Freedom Organization reinforcements swarmed in.

Ge Yinglai's group attacking the villa gates soon regretted their choice—the "mere guards" were elite cultivators armed with revolvers. Within minutes, attackers fell like wheat before scythes. "Impossible!" Ge screamed, battered by two guards. "How?!"

Sun Xu, watching safely from the rear, lied to Bill Lin via phone: "Guan Yu's retreating! Tonight he dies!"

Bill Lin hung up, sneering, "Fools. If Guan Yu were that weak, I wouldn't need sacrificial lambs."

As Freedom Organization fighters joined the fray, their discipline turned the tide. Ge Yinglai's forces crumbled against cultivators while Sun Xu's mercenaries found themselves outmaneuvered.

Chapter 2650: Too Late

Ge Yinglai realized his error too late—Guan Yu's "guards" were battle-hardened experts. Within minutes, his attackers fell while defenders stood unscathed. Sun Xu's promised rewards fueled reckless charges, but Guan Yu's reinforcements arrived in force.

When Bill Lin called for updates, Sun Xu boasted, "We're crushing them! Guan Yu hides behind women!"

"Excellent," Bill purred before muttering post-call, "Idiots. If he were that weak..."

Xue Jing and Jones, though pressured, protected Guan Yu flawlessly until backup allowed counterattacks. The tide turned as Freedom Organization members—drilled in loyalty—engaged with military precision.

Ge Yinglai's remaining forces broke under cultivator onslaughts. Sun Xu's mercenaries, initially bold, faltered against coordinated strikes. As dawn approached, the invaders' screams faded—their nightmare realized, their masters' betrayal complete.
