“Actually, the call had already ended, but Guan Yu continued pretending, ‘Hmm? Can’t your Fang family even scrape together a measly three million during the holidays? Looks like you’re heading for bankruptcy! Don’t blame me then… What? The old steward doesn’t matter? Save your breath. He’s your problem. I want money. No cash, he dies.’”

Of course, these words were solely for Gao Bing’s ears. After speaking, Guan Yu pursed his lips and turned to glare at Gao Bing, whose heart churned with dread. Meeting Guan Yu’s gaze, he realized his precarious situation.

Gao Bing thought, *Has the Fang family truly abandoned me? Impossible. My younger sister wouldn’t forsake me. But what did Guan Yu’s words mean? Why is he looking at me like that?*

He knew three million wasn’t trivial, but for the Fangs, it was pocket change. *Would they really discard me over this sum?*

Guan Yu shook his head and said, “Damn it, maybe I rambled too much. Young Master Fang refuses to pay three million for the ransom.” He directed this at Jia Bo beside him, feigning nonchalance.

Jia Bo blinked. “What? Didn’t Young Master Fang claim Gao Bing was his uncle? He won’t cough up lousy three million? Should we offer a discount?”

Guan Yu nearly laughed aloud. *This idiot Jia Bo…* But he maintained his act, sighing, “No use. Young Master Fang says Gao Bing leaked the family’s secrets. He’s worthless now—‘rotten meat’ to be discarded.”

“Lies!” Gao Bing roared, hoarse from hours hanging mid-air and prior torture. “The Fangs wouldn’t abandon me! I never betrayed them! You’re spouting nonsense!”

Guan Yu tilted his head mockingly. “You’re just rotten meat now. Scream all night—will it summon the Fangs? They’ve abandoned you. Young Master Fang even offered me five million to keep their secrets. You’re a traitor. Think they’ll rescue you? They want you dead. Even if they paid, they’d silence you afterward. To them, you’re worthless.”

“No… impossible! You’re lying…” Gao Bing muttered feverishly, eyes darting wildly. His panic betrayed his belief in Guan Yu’s words—and the Fang family’s ruthlessness.

**Chapter 2,488: No Value**

The Fangs had a history of discarding spent pawns. Those who outlived their usefulness vanished, “eliminated” to protect the family’s reputation. Gao Bing now faced this fate.

Cold fear gripped him. Survival depended on himself now. Whether Guan Yu lied or not, relying on the Fangs was folly.

Noticing Gao Bing’s shaken expression, Guan Yu ordered Jia Bo, “He’s useless. Bury him.”

Jia Bo hesitated. *Bury him alive? After tonight’s efforts?*

Gao Bing screamed, “Wait! I’m still valuable!”

Guan Yu smirked. “Oh? How? The Fangs abandoned you. My men worked for nothing. Their anger is mine. No value? You get buried.”

“I know Fang family secrets! Leverage against them! I’ll trade this for my life!” Gao Bing pleaded, desperate.

Guan Yu smiled. “That depends on your secrets’ worth…”

Meanwhile, Fang Su frantically gathered funds, anxiety mounting with each passing minute.

As he fumed, a woman entered the living room. “Brother, who provoked you?”

She stood tall at over 1.7 meters, her figure accentuated by a fashionable pale blue dress and heels that made her tower slightly above Fang Su. This was Fang Ding—flawless skin, sharp features, and an aura of haughty elegance.

Suppressing his rage, Fang Su forced a smile. “Just someone testing my patience.”

Fang Ding lounged on a sofa, examining her nails. “Then have them dealt with. Why the fury?”

Fang Su’s eye twitched. “Right. I’ll make him suffer. Speaking of… your nails look exquisite.”

She flaunted her manicured hand. “A master’s work. Costly and time-consuming.”

Fang Su admired her unblemished fingers. “How do you maintain these as a Western Martial practitioner? Slacking off?”

“Never!” she retorted. “I train rigorously. But hands are a woman’s second face. My master taught me special care techniques.”

“Master Haichu is remarkable,” Fang Su mused. “Ageless beauty, formidable skills… pity she chose Daoism.”

He’d been smitten since meeting her at Fang Ding’s initiation—her youthful appearance belying her thirties, ethereal even in simple robes.

“Brother, do you fancy my master?” Fang Ding teased.

“How could I?” he demurred. “A celestial being like her? Beyond mortal men.”

Fang Ding nodded. “No man deserves her. Hence, she took vows.”

A phone interrupted. Fang Su barked, “Hurry up, incompetents!” before sighing. “It’s Guan Yu. He kidnapped Uncle Gao, demanding three million.”

“Guan Yu? Yang Conghan’s boyfriend?”

“Yes! That country bumpkin leeching off women! But I must retrieve Uncle Gao discreetly.”

“Let me go,” Fang Ding offered. “With money and guards, I’ll handle it.”

**Chapter 2,489: Killing Time**

Fang Su eyed her. “Can you manage?”

“Of course. My martial arts aren’t for show. He won’t dare harm a woman.”

“Fine. Guards and cash by morning.”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu listened to Gao Bing’s tales of Fang family scandals—useful for blackmail, if not proof.

Jia Bo rushed in. “Boss, Shen Fangcheng’s fleeing!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “The old fool’s desperate. Send men to intercept—with evidence.”

Leaving Jia Bo, Guan Yu visited Shen’s deserted factory. Finding it unguarded, he called Jia Bo, who’d alerted police to intercept Shen at the airport.

Guan Yu dialed Shen. “Heard you’re fleeing? Police have the documents. Blame yourself for non-cooperation.”

In an airport restroom, Shen trembled. “You’ll pay for this, Guan Yu!”

“You’ll be too dead to care,” Guan Yu retorted, hanging up.

Bored, he took Xue Jing for late-night coffee at Hua Ye Club.

A haughty woman approached their table. “You’re Guan Yu?”

“Indeed. And you?”

“Just confirming. We’ll meet again.” With a wave, Fang Ding left.

Xue Jing teased, “Quite the ladies’ man now.”

“Troublesome followers,” Guan Yu grumbled.

Club owner Hou Jinshun joined them. “Heard about the treasure map?”

Guan Yu frowned. “What treasure?”

“Rumors of a decade-old clan war treasure. Collect all map fragments, find unimaginable wealth.”

Hou leaned closer. “They say it’s linked to the clan wars. The one tied to Zhang Han…”

Guan Yu’s interest sparked. Zhang Han’s mother had sealed treasure memories in her mind before death. If true, this concerned Zhang Han and Jin Hua.

“Three fragments surfaced already,” Hou continued. “Treasure hunters swarm the city.”

Though skeptical, Guan Yu pondered. If real, this treasure belonged to Zhang Han—not opportunists.

**Chapter 2,490: A Good Price**

“Any proof it’s the clan war treasure?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Claims say so. The finder becomes empire-rich.”

Guan Yu’s resolve hardened. Whether myth or truth, he’d ensure no one exploited Zhang Han’s legacy.
