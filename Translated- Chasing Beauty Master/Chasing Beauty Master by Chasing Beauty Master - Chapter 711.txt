“Did you forget your medicine this morning, or take the wrong dose?” Guan Yu snapped furiously.

“Is that any of your business?”

“Seems you’re starved for affection.” With a sudden motion, Guan Yu yanked Lyu Mei close, his arm locking around her slender waist as he pressed her firmly against his chest. Her ample bosom crushed against his solid torso, her feet leaving the ground as their lips hovered mere millimeters apart.

The intimate proximity left Lyu Mei flustered. Though she weakly pounded his shoulders with her fists, part of her reveled in the situation. Her delicate face flushed crimson as she protested in a breathy whisper, “What are you doing? Let me go!”

Guan Yu’s lips nearly brushed hers as he growled, “If you keep provoking me, I’ll strip you naked in front of the whole class and ravage you ten thousand times.”

Never one to back down, the fiery-tempered girl shot back, “Go ahead! Do it! I dare you!” She squirmed against him defiantly, her body rubbing against his.

A dark smirk crossed Guan Yu’s face as his hand darted toward her collar. Lyu Mei gasped, clutching her chest protectively. When he tried prying her hands away, genuine fear flashed across her paling features. “Stop! I’m sorry! I’ll behave!” she pleaded.

Terrified he might actually disrobe her publicly, she struggled futilely in his iron grip. Guan Yu chuckled. “Apology accepted—on one condition. Kiss me, and I’ll let you go.”

Wei Hongwei chimed in from the sidelines, “Give him a kiss! He won’t back down otherwise!” Soon the entire female class joined the chorus: “Kiss him! Kiss him!”

To most girls, Guan Yu was their dream prince. Many envied Lyu Mei’s position, fantasizing about being crushed against his muscular frame themselves.

**Chapter 1806: Call Me a Hero**

Though mortified, Lyu Mei felt a thrill of excitement. Had they been alone, she might have kissed him willingly. Steeling herself, she moistened her lips with a flick of her tongue and pecked his cheek.

Electricity surged through her body. She’d actually kissed him in public! Burying her burning face in his chest, she heard the class erupt in cheers. “Woo! Yeah!”

Guan Yu fought the urge to take things further right there. *This minx must really like me*, he mused, releasing her abruptly. Lyu Mei collapsed bonelessly into her seat.

“You’re mine now,” he declared before turning to Wei Hongwei. “Heard that new pop diva A Mei’s performing in A City tonight. Let’s try catching a glimpse of this so-called celestial beauty.”

“Really? She’s my idol!” Wei Hongwei gushed.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes. “Pathetic. You’d worship any pretty face.”

As their laughter faded down the hallway, Lyu Mei fumed alone. *That heartless jerk! After my first kiss, he runs off chasing another girl? Bastard! Womanizer! If we ever have kids...* She blushed at her own thoughts, slamming textbooks in frustration.

**Chapter 1807: Filthy Mouth**

At the hospital, Chen Maosheng grinned through bruised lips. “Dad, they broke your son! You have to destroy Guan Yu!”

The mayor’s wife shrieked at Guan Yu during the police interrogation: “You gutter trash! I’ll have you rotting in jail!”

Guan Yu spat his tea in her face. “Madam Mayor, what brand of toothpaste do you use? Your breath reeks like a sewer.”

As chaos erupted, Investigator Xue Jing entered with a phone call that drained the color from Mayor Chen’s face. The couple slunk away defeated, their threats empty.

**Chapter 1808: A Mei**

During biology class, Wei Hongwei shook Guan Yu awake. “The goddess A Mei’s shooting a music video in the botanical garden! Let’s go!”

The campus erupted into a stampede. Lyu Mei trailed behind Guan Yu, still tender from their last encounter. Since the classroom kiss, she’d become his shadow—equal parts resentful and adoring.

Amid the jostling crowd, Guan Yu spotted the raven-haired songstress surrounded by bodyguards. A Mei’s porcelain skin glowed under studio lights, her crimson sunglasses adding an air of mystery. When their eyes met, she smiled—a celestial vision that made even Lyu Mei gasp.

The pop icon’s laugh tinkled like wind chimes as she extended a hand toward Guan Yu. “My hero from last night! I’ve been looking for you...”
