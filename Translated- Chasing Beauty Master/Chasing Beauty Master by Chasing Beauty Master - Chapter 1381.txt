Wang Xiaorong asked curiously, “What exactly is this 'Boundary Sovereign Relic' you mentioned? Tell me more. Perhaps our Soul Demon Sect possesses it, or we could use the sect’s resources to help you find it.”

“It’s not that simple,” Guan Yu countered. “To obtain a Boundary Sovereign Relic, one must kill a peak Boundary Sovereign expert. Does your Soul Demon Sect possess such capability?”

“What? Killing someone at the peak of Boundary Sovereign strength? That seems impossible!”

“Indeed, it’s inherently implausible. Those who reach the peak of Boundary Sovereign cultivation possess their own life-preserving methods. Eliminating such an individual is fundamentally unachievable. In essence, those who cultivate to the Boundary Sovereign zenith become virtually indestructible.”

“I still don’t understand. What exactly is a Boundary Sovereign Relic?”

Guan Yu explained, “When cultivators reach the peak of Boundary Sovereign strength, they condense their internal energy into a solid core within their dantian—an inexhaustible reservoir of power. Upon slaying such an expert, one obtains this crystallized inner core, which we call the Boundary Sovereign Relic.”

“Ah, I see now.” Wang Xiaorong nodded as comprehension dawned. “But this seems too difficult—practically unfeasible. Wait... Didn’t you claim to have slain a peak Boundary Sovereign demonic creature before? Didn’t it possess such a core?”

Guan Yu sighed deeply. “It did. But that’s a long story. I used that relic to save someone. By the time I discovered the seal in my mind... it was already too late.” Regret tinged his voice as he reflected that preserving the relic might have maintained his peak Boundary Sovereign status, though such thoughts now proved futile.

“You used such a precious treasure to save someone? Who could be so important to you?”

“A friend’s father. At the time, I was unaware of the seal in my mind and the relic’s potential to break it. The man I saved had mere breaths remaining—without the relic, he would’ve perished.”

Chapter 3579: Boundless Curiosity

Guan Yu omitted mentioning how saving the Yang family patriarch had involved meeting a stunning beauty—knowledge that would surely provoke Wang Xiaorong’s reproach.

“Perhaps this was fortuitous,” Wang Xiaorong said cheerfully. “Without this incident, you wouldn’t have come here. Had you not arrived, we might never have met, remaining strangers across distant lands.”

“True. I never imagined coming to this place—a world centuries behind, devoid of modern comforts. Were it not for seeking immortality to break my seal, I’d never linger in this backward realm.”

“Do my presence displease you? Why call this a ‘backward realm’? As if your homeland surpasses even the capital’s splendor!”

“It outshines the capital a hundredfold,” Guan Yu declared. “What are palace towers compared to skyscrapers? Have you witnessed aircraft or automobiles? This world lacks all modern marvels.”

“Your tales grow more fascinating! What are these things you describe?” Wang Xiaorong’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

“Explanations would prove meaningless. Observe this—you’ve never seen its like.” Guan Yu produced his smartphone, handing it to her.

“What’s this? A polished metal slab? Some refined magical artifact?”

“This is called a phone. It requires electricity to function—scarce here, with no signal coverage. Useless in this realm.” Guan Yu elaborated, “Its primary purpose is communication. Regardless of distance, dialing a number enables instant conversation. Imagine informing the Demon Lord from here—if you both possessed phones.”

“Marvelous! Yet we have voice-transmission artifacts here too—nothing extraordinary.”

“But how rare those are! In my homeland, nearly everyone owns a phone with unique number. Conversations last days without exhausting energy, unlike your spirit-powered devices that drain cultivators.”

“Yet your device requires this ‘signal.’ Without it, isn’t it equally useless?”

Guan Yu conceded her point. “True perfection eludes all things. But signals from satellites blanket most habitable regions.”

“Your words grow more perplexing! Promise me—when you return, gift me such a phone. Wherever you wander, I could find you.”

“Easily done. The finest model awaits you—when I regain my home.”

Wang Xiaorong marveled at Guan Yu’s perfection—flawless in every aspect. Finding such an ideal partner felt like karmic reward across lifetimes.

“You claimed peak Boundary Sovereign strength. Reaching such cultivation takes centuries. Do you possess immortality? Typically, Boundary Sovereign experts are centenarian elders.”

“My true age remains obscured by sealed memories. Whether immortal or not, only unsealing will reveal.”

Chapter 3580: Unbelievable Truths

Wang Xiaorong’s questions flowed endlessly. “What cultivation level will break your seal? Should I request my father’s aid?”

“Impossible. The seal resides in my brain’s lethal meridian. External interference risks fatal damage. Only gradual self-liberation works.” Guan Yu added, “I’ve felt two seal weakenings—first during Cloud Azure Sect’s Merit Cauldron empowerment, then upon obtaining the Eight-Drum Technique.”

“Ah! In Elder Menghua’s crypt—you writhed in agony, drenched in sweat!”

“Exactly. The Eight-Drum energy clashed with the seal, nearly killing me. Only their mutual withdrawal spared me.”

“How terrifying! But didn’t the technique enhance your spiritual power?”

“Barely. A fraction seeped through to my dantian, refining energy purity. The rest remains trapped, battling at my mind’s frontier.”

“Constant conflict in your brain? Isn’t that perilous?”

“Fate governs this. Ironically, absorbing the technique fully would’ve exposed me during Elder Xuanming’s Sacred Beast Scale inspection. Expulsion or execution would’ve followed.”

“They’d treat you so harshly? A rare dual cultivator like you?”

“Cloud Azure’s elders elevate useful tools but eliminate threats preemptively. They’re merciless pragmatists.”

“So-called righteous factions surpass our demonic sects in cunning. Their deceit lurks in shadows.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Morality matters little—all harbor hidden agendas. My focus remains cultivation until the seal breaks.”

“Cloud Azure won’t permit peaceful cultivation. They’ll create endless troubles.”

Though acknowledging her point, Guan Yu refused betrayal. “Unless they expel me first, I’ll remain loyal.”

Knowing Guan Yu’s integrity, Wang Xiaorong changed tactics. “Remember the girl we rescued at Blackblood Ridge? Where is she now?”

“Should be at Convergence Peak. Why?”

“She vanished long ago. Blood Lord’s toxin struck—Cloud Azure denied treatment, quarantined her at Bamboo Peak. By now, she’s likely dead.”

“What?!” Guan Yu’s anger flared. “They saved her only to abandon her? This matches demonic cruelty!”

“Elder Xuanming prioritized conserving strength against us. The Merit Cauldron could’ve purified the toxin easily.”

Guan Yu’s disillusionment deepened. “Had I known, I’d have saved her myself. Their hypocrisy disgusts me.”

Wang Xiaorong traced circles on his chest. “That weapon you used against the Demon Lord—what was it? The explosion astonished me.”

After extracting promises of secrecy, Guan Yu revealed his Desert Eagle pistol.

Chapter 3581: Reluctant Parting

“A ‘handgun’? Strange name! Heavy metal contraption—how’s it used?” Wang Xiaorong examined the weapon.

“Modern technology from my world. Fires projectiles called bullets—instant death at close range. No cultivation required.” Guan Yu demonstrated the magazine. “Seven shots remain.”

“Seven uses? Incredible! Let me test it!”

“Impossible without ammunition. This world lacks replacement bullets.” Guan Yu’s smile turned wistful. “Its presence reminds me of home—and why I must eventually return.”

Their conversation drifted into night, two figures silhouetted against moonlight, one clutching strange metal artifact, the other marveling at wonders beyond her world.
