Before Guan Yu's eyes stretched a landscape dotted with hundreds of small mounds, each crowned with riotously colorful vegetation. Though the vibrant hues seemed chaotic at first glance, closer inspection revealed intricate patterns – some resembling small animals, others celestial bodies, and still others strange magical sigils.

"Holy shit, these elves are wasting their talents not being gardeners!"

As Guan Yu marveled at the sight, three sharp whistles pierced the air from behind him at one-second intervals. Before he could react, the mounds began quivering as dozens of slender figures emerged from the foliage. Within moments, the color-dappled forms assembled into neat rows before the group.

Now clearly visible, the figures wore skintight suits adorned with painted designs matching their floral surroundings. A leader with sharp features scanned the newcomers. "Identify yourselves! State your business in the Forest of Elves!"

Kaili rushed forward. "It's me! Kaili!"

"Kaili?"

A smaller elf whispered to the leader, "The scout we dispatched two days ago."

"Ah." The leader nodded. "Escort them in."

The attendant elf smiled. "Follow me."

As they wound through the labyrinthine mounds, Guan Yu grumbled, "Why this convoluted path? How much longer?"

Luoxi explained, "After humans nearly exterminated us in the Great Purge, our elders devised shifting formations. Only three elders and the chieftain know the daily patterns."

"Then how..." Guan Yu gestured at their guide.

"They're forest guardians," Luoxi said. "The knowledge passes through trusted channels."

**Chapter 1238: The Grand Scribe**

Though familiar with defensive formations, Guan Yu marveled at their application here. "Impressive security. But what if enemies coerce the guides?"

Their elven escort whirled around. "What are you implying?"

"Just... theoretical precautions!"

Kaili and Luoxi glared. "Unlike humans, we elves have principles!"

Guan Yu held his tongue, remembering humanity's frequent betrayals for personal gain.

Emerging from the maze, they entered an orderly forest bisected by a wide path leading to a colossal tree towering over 300 meters.

"So this is the Forest of Elves?"

"Indeed."

Before Guan Yu could absorb the vista, a voice rang out: "Sisters! Greet our guest!"

Dozens of elven maidens descended from the trees – each clad in revealing tunics that showcased their voluptuous curves. Overwhelmed by the sudden harem, Guan Yu's eyes darted between nearby beauties.

Elven women proved nature's masterpieces – every figure rivaling Luoxi and Kaili's perfection, some surpassing them in grace and allure. A nearby maiden offered a leaf-cup brimming with iridescent nectar.

"Friend, drink this gift from our people."

Her lilting voice sent shivers through Guan Yu as their fingers brushed during the exchange. "Darling, call me husband, not friend."

"Husband?" The maiden blushed crimson behind delicate hands.

"By the gods!" Guan Yu exclaimed. "Is this sacred grove or pleasure den? So many beauties... Am I to perish beneath peonies today?"

Watching him ogle the maidens, Luoxi felt unexpected pangs. *Why does this rake's antics bother me?*

The viscous liquid burned Guan Yu's throat like firewine. "What devil's brew is this?" he choked as giggling elves covered their smiles. *Curse these vixens! If not for diplomacy...*

"Enough!" Luoxi interjected. "Must you shame us before guests?"

"Oho! Luoxi-jie's sweet on him!" someone teased. "The Ice Queen melts!"

A commanding voice silenced the chatter. Emerging from the crowd came a regal elf in white robes – her beauty mature yet undimmed. The Grand Scribe's gaze pinned Guan Yu like a specimen.

"Who dares call me crone?" Her lips curved coldly as Guan Yu gaped. "Your face betrays your thoughts, dragon-child."

"Shit! Mind-reader?"

The Grand Scribe's crimson nails seized his wrist. "What schemes bring you here, you lecherous..."

Their struggle sent Guan Yu's face colliding with her bosom. "Pervert!" she hissed, though her racing heartbeat betrayed long-suppressed desires.

Guan Yu's arm swelled painfully as internal heat surged. *This woman's dangerous... but not invincible.*

"Grand Scribe Jia Mei!" Aimi pleaded. "He saved us from slavers!"

Jia Mei's grip loosened. "Dragonkin? You?"

Guan Yu puffed his chest. "The one and only!"

The Grand Scribe's manner thawed. "Though noble-born, mind your conduct. We elves honor guests who honor us."

*Hypocritical hag!* Guan Yu seethed silently. *Your hussies provoked me!*

"Have you come regarding the Pact?"

"Uh... naturally!" Guan Yu bluffed. "Dragon-Elf alliance could dominate Blue Glory Continent!"

Jia Mei's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Then enjoy our hospitality. Attend him thoroughly, sisters."

Guan Yu's imagination ran wild – until Luoxi stepped forward.

"Stop! Must we whore ourselves for politics?"

The Grand Scribe arched a brow. "Propose alternatives."

"Let... let me show him our culture properly!"

"Excellent notion." Jia Mei turned to Guan Yu. "Agreed?"

Meeting Luoxi's flushed face, Guan Yu grinned savagely. "Perfect. But only with this beauty as guide."

*You'll regret ruining my fun, little ice queen.*

**Chapter 1240: Wellspring of Life**

"Since we're touring," Guan Yu declared, "this rose has thorns I'll gladly grasp!"
