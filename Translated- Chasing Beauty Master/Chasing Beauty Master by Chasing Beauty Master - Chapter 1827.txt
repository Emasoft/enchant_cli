Miss Jiang (蒋大小姐) retracted her skeptical gaze and fixed her eyes intently on Guan Yu. With measured composure, she stated, "A fair-faced young gentleman of impeccable appearance. I truly wonder where Her Highness the Princess found someone like you. I shan't demand explanations now – regardless of whether you're the Princess's agent, might I beg a favor of you?"

"Impossible." Guan Yu's refusal rang like steel striking stone. He continued, "Miss Jiang, I know your request. You wish me to withdraw my bids and yield this estate to Chu Fan, correct?"

Miss Jiang's brows knitted slightly. "I never beg favors. For Chu Fan's sake, I merely—"

"Enough." Guan Yu raised a hand. "I comprehend perfectly. Yet I must clarify – I am no agent of the Princess. This estate holds my genuine interest, and I shall claim it today. Should Chu Fan desire it hereafter, he may purchase it from me... at a fair price." His words carried deliberate provocation, knowing full well Chu Fan's financial constraints. This transparent scheme to inflate resale value left the young noble seething.

Guan Yu pressed on, "The Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl was gifted in admiration of your person, Miss Jiang. But in matters of masculine contention, I find no such appreciation. My apologies." His meaning hung clear as temple bells – no quarter would be given.

"Would you accept this as personal debt?" Miss Jiang's unprecedented offer carried staggering weight. A favor from the Jiang heir surpassed even imperial currency in value.

"Jiang Xin, cease!" Chu Fan interjected bitterly. "This agent of the Princess toys with us. No entreaty will sway him." The defeated noble returned to his seat, robes swirling like storm clouds.

Undeterred, Miss Jiang pursued, "Wan Hong, even condemned men deserve clarity. This bidding war profits only the auction house. If you admit being the Princess's pawn, I'll persuade Chu Fan to withdraw."

Guan Yu met her gaze steadily. "Truthfully, I know neither this Princess nor her designs. Newly arrived in the capital, I navigate unfamiliar waters. Yet this estate I must claim, though aware we dance to the auctioneer's tune. My resolve stands unshaken."

"You speak in circles!" Miss Jiang's composure frayed. "Denying allegiance yet persisting in this farce – what manner of stubborn fool are you?"

Guan Yu inclined his head. "I risk your displeasure, yet trust your noble character won't persecute an unrelated party. While I admire your forthright spirit, here I cannot yield. My apologies remain."

Chu Fan's fist slammed the table. "Sixty-five thousand taels! Since you won't retreat, let's bleed each other dry! I'll bid beyond my means to inflate your price!"

"Seventy thousand." Guan Yu's counter came swift as a drawn blade, though this sum strained even his resources. The game escalated dangerously.

Miss Jiang stamped her foot in frustration, storming to Chu Fan's side. Guan Yu observed mildly, "Your devotion to Chu Fan is admirable. A rare jewel in this world of pretense."

"Seventy-five thousand!" Chu Fan's shout echoed through the hall.

Guan Yu's brow furrowed. This reckless escalation threatened to undo all strategy. "Eighty thousand – my absolute limit. Exceed this, and the estate is yours." His declaration hung in the air, amplified by the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl's earlier trade. Without that transaction, his coffers would have emptied long since.

Chu Fan rose, face ashen. "Victory is yours, Wan Hong. My own limit broke at sixty thousand. May fortune favor you." With a swirl of sleeves, he departed like autumn leaves before frost.

Miss Jiang's parting glance carried winter's chill before she followed. The auctioneer's jubilant cry sealed the outcome: "Sold! Master Wan Hong claims Vermilion Phoenix Estate for eighty thousand taels!"

Later, clutching the deed and obsidian gem, Guan Yu contemplated his sudden notoriety. The capital's rumor mills would churn tirelessly now. Yet empty purses demanded attention – he needed Du Teng's connections, and swiftly.

Meanwhile, Miss Jiang stormed into Princess's chambers, her voice preceding her like thunder. "Mother! You promised to cease harassing Chu Fan! Why send that Wan Hong to torment him?"

The Princess, reclining on her daybed, sighed at her daughter's disheveled state. At her gesture, attendants scattered like startled sparrows. "Child, must you resemble tavern riffraff? What nonsense do you spout now?"

"Don't feign ignorance! That Wan Hong you dispatched – he stole Chu Fan's estate at auction!" Miss Jiang brandished the Dragon Pearl. "This bribe proves your hand!"

The Princess's eyes narrowed at the legendary artifact. "What manner of trickery...?" Her mind raced through decades of court intrigues, recognizing the pearl's mythic significance. "Where did you obtain this?"

"From Wan Hong himself! He claims it's mere admiration, but we both know—"

"Enough!" The Princess's voice cracked like ice. "This game exceeds your understanding. That pearl... its implications..." Her words trailed into uneasy silence, the ghost of maritime legends stirring in her eyes.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu's reputation swelled like monsoon floods. Tales spread of his confrontation with Cao Di – how he'd disfigured the Cao heir while Jiang Yuan Kai (蒋元开) shielded him. Gossipmongers wove fantasies of betrothals and hidden agendas, their whispers painting him as Jiang's chosen son-in-law and martial prodigy.

In the Tang household, Patriarch Tang stroked his beard contemplatively. "A mysterious outsider wielding the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl... This bears watching. If Jiang Yuan Kai seeks the maritime treasures—"

His son Tang Mu Chen nodded. "The crowds say Wan Hong moves like a seasoned master. His alliance with the Jiangs could shift power balances."

Elsewhere, the Cao manor echoed with rage. Patriarch Cao smashed porcelain as his wife wailed. "Our son's face ruined, and we must swallow this insult?!"

"Silence!" Cao roared. "Jiang Yuan Kai invoked imperial edicts! One misspoken word and Di's life..." His fist clenched impotently. The bitter truth choked him – against royal connections, even the mighty Cao stood vulnerable.

Chapter 4803: Bonds Forged in Fire

As dusk painted the capital in amber, Guan Yu surveyed his new estate. The Vermilion Phoenix's courtyards whispered of coming storms. Yet his thoughts drifted northward – when would Wang Xiao Rong arrive? Her presence might anchor him in this treacherous new world.

In the Jiang residence, Miss Jiang paced like caged tigress. "I'll unravel this web, Mother. If Wan Hong serves you, I'll make him yield that estate to Chu Fan!"

The Princess studied her daughter with weary eyes. "Child, you mistake shadows for substance. That pearl... its appearance heralds older currents than your petty squabbles. The Dragon's Wake approaches, and we all must choose our course."
