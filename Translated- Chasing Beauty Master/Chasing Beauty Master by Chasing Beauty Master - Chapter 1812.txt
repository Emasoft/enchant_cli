“Very well,” Chief Lu said. “Now that the two newlyweds have received everyone’s gifts, set down your treasures. It’s time to pay respects to the elders in the rear hall.”

“Uncle Lu, let us proceed now,” Chief Zheng said. This time, not all disciples could follow—only the chief disciples, the newlyweds Xiao Zhi and Du Bingyan, were permitted to enter. The rest had to wait outside, though the ceremony would likely conclude swiftly.

Guanyu desperately wanted to enter. He yearned to see which elders were present, as the elders of Yunqing Sect were notoriously reclusive. Aside from Elder Jiu and the guardian of the Merit Cauldron, he knew none of them.

Tugging Siqi along, Guanyu approached Chief Lu and whispered, “Uncle Lu, may Siqi and I enter as well?”

Chief Lu hesitated. While he personally had no objections, the elders had explicitly forbidden other disciples from attending. He couldn’t make such a decision alone.

Turning, Chief Lu spotted someone and pointed. “Guanyu, if you wish to enter, this isn’t my decision. But I’ll tell you—follow Xiao Dong. If he takes you in, no one will question it.”

Guanyu brightened. Xiao Dong, Elder Jiu’s attendant, could move freely. Given their friendship, Xiao Dong could smuggle them in without issue—something Chief Lu couldn’t risk without inviting criticism.

To avoid burdening Chief Lu, Guanyu pulled Siqi toward Xiao Dong and gestured his request to visit Elder Jiu. Fortunately, Guanyu had spent time with Elder Jiu in the back mountains, where the elder and Xiao Dong often communicated through gestures resembling sign language. Though Guanyu hadn’t mastered it, he could mimic the basics.

Xiao Dong nodded and motioned for them to follow. Despite his childlike demeanor, Xiao Dong understood the elders’ aversion to excessive formalities. Their attendance at Xiao Zhi’s wedding was purely a courtesy to Chief Zheng.

Yet Xiao Dong believed Elder Jiu would welcome Guanyu, given their history. Following Xiao Dong through the main hall to the rear chamber, Guanyu immediately spotted Elder Jiu seated at the far end, flanked by two unfamiliar elders of equal stature.

Xiao Zhi and Du Bingyan knelt to kowtow before the three elders, while Sect Leader Xuanming and others stood silently nearby.

“Rise, children,” Elder Jiu said warmly. “Today is your joyous occasion. Excessive formalities are unnecessary—we understand your respect.”

Xiao Dong squatted beside Elder Jiu, gesturing toward Guanyu and Siqi. Noticing them, Elder Jiu said flatly, “Enter and close the door.”

Relieved they weren’t expelled, Guanyu shut the door and led Siqi forward. They knelt and kowtowed, displaying utmost deference.

**Chapter 4742: Bestowing Full Honor**

Chief Dai, seeing Siqi, fretted over the elders’ displeasure. “Why are you two here? Only the newlyweds should present themselves. Shall we arrange your wedding next?”

Xiao Zhi seized the chance to tease, “An excellent idea!” He grinned, savoring the jab.

Guanyu rose after kowtowing. “I merely wished to pay respects to Elder Jiu, whom I’ve missed dearly. His presence here provided the perfect opportunity.”

Chief Dai rolled her eyes at Guanyu’s silver tongue but relaxed, seeing the elders unperturbed.

Elder Jiu smiled, pleased by Guanyu’s loyalty. “Visit me in the back mountains whenever you wish.”

“But it’s forbidden territory,” Guanyu protested, though he’d sneaked there often before. Now, with the Eight-Drum Art hidden in his Emperor’s Seal, he dared not risk Elder Jiu discovering it.

“Since when do you care about forbidden zones?” Sect Leader Xuanming snapped. “You’ve trespassed plenty!”

Guanyu chuckled awkwardly, retreating with Siqi.

The two elder flanking Jiu appeared even older, exuding immortal grace. One wore gray robes with snow-white hair and beard; the other’s hair was salt-and-pepper. Both remained silent except for acknowledging the newlyweds’ bows.

Chief Zheng stepped forward, bowing deeply. “Honored Elders, your presence at Xuánzhōng Peak blesses my son beyond measure. This wedding gains unparalleled prestige through your attendance. I thank you profoundly.”

His words held truth—the reclusive elders rarely involved themselves in sect affairs, often sequestered for decades. Their appearance here signified immense respect for Chief Zheng.

“You’ve served Yunqing Sect diligently for a century,” Elder Jiu replied. “We should witness such milestones. Moreover, Xiao Zhi’s diligence and fourth-place finish in the Six Peaks Tournament merit recognition.”

“Thank you for your esteem, Elder Jiu.” Chief Zheng bowed again. “We’ll take our leave now.”

“Stay,” Elder Jiu commanded. “I’ve questions for the girl.” The elders had heard of Du Bingyan’s self-taught prowess—forming an energy core through sheer talent. They wished to assess her.

Guanyu wondered why these elders offered no gifts. The white-haired elder suddenly spoke: “Girl, I’m curious about your martial progress. Would you spar with me?”

Chief Zheng paled. “Elder, she’s a novice! Today is her wedding—“

“Peace, Chief Zheng,” Elder Jiu interjected. “Elder Ba is our foremost martial scholar. His guidance would benefit her.”

Sect Leader Xuanming recalled—Elder Ba, the sect’s martial fanatic, excelled in both spells and physical combat despite lacking internal energy. His interest in Du Bingyan’s talent made sense.

Guanyu frowned. Couldn’t these stingy elders at least present gifts instead of treating her like a表演monkey? Even thrifty Chief Xiang had given something!

Stepping forward, Guanyu declared, “Elder Ba, Du Bingyan lacks experience. Allow me to lend her this.” He produced the Blood Sword—a recent acquisition from Chief Lu in exchange for the Dragon’s Eye Amber. “Use this against Elder Ba. It’ll compensate for her rawness.”

Chief Lu nearly choked seeing his prized sword. “Guanyu! This is a lethal blade! A spar needs no weapons!”

“The Blood Sword?” The silent third elder finally spoke. All three elders stared—this was a high-grade spiritual artifact!

Elder Jiu chuckled. “Generous as ever, Guanyu. Do you truly have so many treasures to spare?”

“This… is too precious!” Du Bingyan protested.

“A wedding gift,” Guanyu insisted. “Keep it. Surely the elders will present their own gifts later.” He shot the elders a pointed look.

Elder Jiu’s smile faded. “Guanyu mentioned gifting Xuanming an immortal artifact—the white Dragon’s Eye Amber. Is this true?”

Xuanming glared at Guanyu, who cheerfully confirmed: “Useless to me, so I gave it to Master.”

“An elite immortal artifact!” Elder Jiu thundered. “Xuanming! Explain!”

Sweating, Xuanming said, “It was a fair trade! Chief Lu and I exchanged numerous treasures for it!”
