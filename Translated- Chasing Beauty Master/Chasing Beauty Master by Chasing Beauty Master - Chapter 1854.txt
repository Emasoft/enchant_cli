“Of course I won’t leave like this. Even if not for the Belle Theater, I’d stay for my brother’s sake. Wan Hong is my sworn brother – how could I abandon him?” Chu Fan declared with resolute determination, his expression hardening as if steel had entered his soul.

Jiang Xin’s smile blossomed like spring peach blossoms. This was the Chu Fan she admired. Though uncertain how much support her family might provide, her heart soared knowing that at least her presence here could shield him from the worst harm.

Guan Yu remained silent, warmed yet conflicted by his friend’s resolve. The younger man’s timidity in facing adversity tempered his earlier optimism about their alliance.

The heavy doors burst open as two men stormed in, their voices roaring through the hall like thunderclaps. “Who dares lay hands on our Young Master?!”

Qu Hua’s tear-streaked face lit up at the sight of his family’s retainers. Collapsed in his chair like broken willow, he wailed, “You’ve come at last! I nearly died here! Make them pay!” His legs hung useless beneath him, numbness having stolen all sensation.

The retainers circled their charge like puzzled hounds. “Where are your injuries? Cease this blubbering! Are you internally wounded?” Their confusion deepened upon finding no bruises or torn garments – only the pristine silk robes of a pampered noble.

Qu Hua’s trembling finger pointed downward. “One kick... straight to the family jewels,” he whimpered, face crumpling like crushed paper. “That’s no place for rough treatment!”

These were no ordinary servants, but veteran house soldiers of the Qin Family. For twenty years they’d served Lady Qin before being assigned as Qu Hua’s personal guards since his coming of age. Normally shadowing his every step, today’s coincidental absence of both Lord Qin (away on business) and Lady Qin (making temple offerings) had left the young master dangerously exposed.

Summoned from their lady’s retinue upon receiving the emergency message from Ocean’s Abundance Tavern, the guards arrived with clear orders: show no mercy. Capture if possible, kill if necessary. With such authority, their swagger filled the room like smoke from a signal fire.

Exchanging amused glances behind stoic masks, the senior guard demanded, “Where are these attackers?” Their smirks vanished as Qu Hua pointed accusingly at Guan Yu’s group – two men (one crippled) and two women. “Spare Jiang Xin. Break the others!”

Bowing with mock deference, the guards advanced. “Lady Jiang,” the lead guard addressed with careful courtesy – protocol demanded respect for the Emperor’s adopted niece, though she famously disdained formalities. “This matter need not concern you.”

Jiang Xin stepped forward like a protective phoenix. “My friend merely defended his wife from your master’s indecent advances. What fault lies here?”

Guan Yu raised a silencing hand. “Stay clear of this, Lady Jiang. This is between me and the Qins.” His gaze swept over Chu Fan, adding with unexpected gentleness, “Protect the Theater. This storm shouldn’t drown your dreams.”

Chu Fan’s jaw tightened. “True friends share calamities. Let the Theater fall if it must – I stand with you today.”

The crippled man’s transformation from trembling reed to unyielding bamboo startled all present. Guan Yu’s smile held winter’s chill. “Your heart honors me, but watch now how a lone wolf hunts.”

Turning to the Qin guards, his voice dropped to glacier’s rumble. “Your master reaped what he sowed. Touch my woman’s shadow, and I’ll burn your family tree to ash.”

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd as thirty Qin soldiers materialized from the streets. Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed, calculating threats. Common guards posed no challenge, but hidden among the mob...?

“Outsiders!” Qu Hua screeched from his litter, face twisted like vengeful spirit. “Beat him to pulp! Leave breath enough to hear his bones crack!”

As the first soldier lunged, time slowed. Guan Yu’s leg became a steel whip, shattering jaws and sending bodies crashing like ninepins. The remaining men hesitated – never had Qin retainers faced such contempt.

Behind him, Qiqi whispered to Wang Xiaorong, “How long before these fools surrender?”

“Before the third cup of tea cools,” came the amused reply, as Guan Yu moved like dragon among sheep, each strike a verse in the poem of violence.

The crowd surged backward as combat spilled into the streets, merchants and nobles alike craning for view. Jiang Xin watched, realization dawning – this was no ordinary scholar, but the rumored dual-cultivator from her father’s secret reports. Her worry transformed to awe as Guan Yu’s cloak billowed like war banner, his voice shaking shop signs:

“Let all witness! My woman’s honor carries a price even the mighty Qins cannot pay!”

In that moment, the legend of Wan Hong crystallized – not as pampered noble, but as unstoppable force rewriting the rules of power in the capital’s bloody chess game.
