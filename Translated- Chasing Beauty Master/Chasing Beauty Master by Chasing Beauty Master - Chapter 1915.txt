To ensure both of them fully understood, Guan Yu dipped his finger in tea and drew the upturned eaves of a roof on the table. With a crimson-stained fingertip, he inscribed a character, explaining, “Like this—no plaques, no embellishments. Four massive characters fixed upon the eaves, one on each corner. When mounted, their impact will be extraordinary.”

After all, such a design had never been seen here. Its novelty would undoubtedly draw attention.

Though Chu Fan and the deputy manager grasped the concept, they remained uncertain of its feasibility. Yet since Guan Yu insisted, they acquiesced. “If it fails, we can always replace it with a plaque later,” Chu Fan reasoned.

“Since you’ve conceived this bold vision, let us proceed,” Chu Fan declared. “There’s a renowned blacksmith in the capital—a master craftsman I know well. We shall commission him.”

“Excellent. Summon him at once, along with other artisans,” Guan Yu instructed. “I’ll demonstrate how to secure the characters without modern fittings.”

He recalled how skyscrapers in his past world anchored giant characters through steel and concrete. Though lacking such resources here, he envisioned iron rods fastened beneath the theater’s wooden roof beams. Without welding, multiple anchor points would suffice—so long as the structure stood, the characters would endure.

When craftsmen gathered, Guan Yu meticulously sketched and explained. The artisans, though inexperienced with such scale, found the task simpler than crafting delicate jewelry. After finalizing the calligraphic style for “Hongyan Theater (Beauty’s Sigh),” the plan was set.

Guan Yu marveled at their resourcefulness—these craftsmen achieved through rudimentary methods what his world accomplished with advanced technology. Through laborious fire-welding, they fused iron joints, proving ingenuity triumphed over limitation.

Before departing, Guan Yu drew Chu Fan aside. “I leave tomorrow. Should troubles arise, seek Xiao Zuo and Xiaomei at Hongming Mountain. Mention my name—they’ll aid you unconditionally.”

“You’re leaving the capital?” Chu Fan’s voice tightened, the sudden void of leadership palpable. “When will you return?”

“Not soon. The East Sea Treasure calls—Jiang Yuankai (Origin’s Beginning) and I journey north to locate the fabled waters. The Jiang maiden insists on joining, though this is no pleasure excursion. Persuade her to remain.”

Chu Fan nodded grimly. “She’s too delicate for such perils. I’ll visit the驸马爷’s estate at once.”

Approving, Guan Yu hoped this intervention might rekindle Chu Fan’s bond with Jiang Xin (Heart’s Mirror)—a resolution benefiting all.

Later, Duan Ruxue (Snow’s Resemblance) arranged a farewell banquet at Wanyang Tavern, inviting even her father. Reluctant Jiang Yuankai conceded after Guan Yu reasoned: “Publicly claiming the East Sea Dragon Pearl redirects danger to us, shielding the princess and Jiang Xin.”

As they entered the tavern, Guan Yu’s entourage caused pandemonium. Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus), resplendent in a black gown of gossamer layers that hinted at pearl-white slippers, walked like a queen. Qiqi (Jade’s Sparkle), styled in playful elegance, complemented her grace. Gasps followed their passage—trays clattered, drinks spilled, and quarrels erupted as patrons forgot themselves.

Duan Ruxue’s breath caught when she saw Guan Yu’s transformed visage—his tailored white tailcoat and chiseled bearing outshone even the capital’s famed beauties. “Elder Brother Wan,” she murmured, the intimate address thickening the air, “you’ve become... radiant.”

Wang Xiaorong interposed smoothly, “Shall we retire upstairs? This gallery grows tedious.”

Chaos persisted—a noblewoman slapped a server for soiled shoes, another guest howled over scalding tea. Madam Mei, the tavern’s enigmatic overseer, quelled disputes with promises of recompense before greeting Guan Yu. “Young Master Wan, your splendor today could topple dynasties.”

As they ascended, Duan Ruxue’s gaze lingered—a silent acknowledgment that the capital’s hierarchy of charm had irrevocably shifted. In Guan Yu’s wake, even the vaunted “Twin Jewels” of Jiang Xin and Duan Ruxue paled, their radiance eclipsed by this new constellation.
