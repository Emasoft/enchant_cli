“Little brother, don’t be silly.” Qiqi stepped forward and ruffled the boy’s hair, chuckling. “If you follow this young master’s plan, you’ll have food and drink for life without lifting a finger. With his endless silver and such a powerful patron, how could you refuse? Are you truly foolish?”

The group finally grasped her meaning after these words. They exchanged glances until the burly man reached an epiphany—having a benefactor far surpassed their current nomadic life of performances. Moreover, the mentioned theater in the capital surely needed their talents.

This young master clearly meant no harm, having aided them earlier. Such lifesaving grace deserved their trust.

The burly man approached and clasped his fists. “Young Master, we gladly accept your arrangement. Our deepest gratitude for your kindness.”

“No need for formalities.” Guanyu waved a hand, passing over a sealed letter. “I’ve just finished this missive. Take it to the Verdant Blossom Theater in the capital and seek a man named Chu Fan. They’ll ensure your comfort.”

This was the best solution Guanyu could offer. The letter detailed all necessary arrangements. Trusting Chu Fan’s capabilities, Guanyu planned to settle them properly after concluding his current affairs.

At the burly man’s signal, the entire group knelt around Guanyu, kowtowing. “We shall never forget your grace, Young Master!”

“Rise, please!” Guanyu flushed, uncomfortable with the reverence. “Such solemnity isn’t necessary.”

Qiqi laughed brightly. “Your fortunes have turned! Pack quickly and depart for the capital tomorrow.” Her joy mirrored theirs as if their good fortune were her own.

With matters settled and night deepening, the group returned to their inn. Qiqi’s spirits remained buoyant throughout the journey, her heart lightened by Guanyu’s altruism as though the good deed were her own.

Restless in bed, Qiqi sighed. “Brother Wan, I can’t sleep. Will you keep me company?”

Wang Xiaorong sat up nearby. “Qiqi, what could you possibly want to do at this hour? Sleep—we journey at dawn.”

“But I’m exhausted yet wide awake!” Qiqi pouted.

Guanyu brightened. “Since neither of you can rest, let me tell a story. Perhaps it’ll lull you to sleep.”

“Wonderful!” Qiqi squirmed into a listening posture. “Begin at once!”

“What genre? A ghost story?” Guanyu teased before reconsidering. “No, those invigorate rather than soothe. Let’s try a tale of life’s lessons instead.”

**Chapter 5043: Storytelling**

Wang Xiaorong showed no objections, savoring this rare chance to hear Guanyu narrate anything.

With both listeners attentive, Guanyu began: “Once lived a scholar—erudite, handsome, and renowned after topping imperial exams. A matchmaker introduced him to a stunning fiancée. Enamored, he eagerly awaited their wedding day. Yet when the hour came, his bride never appeared. She’d wed another. Heartbroken, the scholar fell gravely ill.”

“Then came an itinerant monk...” Guanyu continued.

“What could a monk do?” Qiqi interjected. “Find him a new wife? His ailment needs a woman’s cure!”

“Hush!” Wang Xiaorong chided. “Let him continue!”

Guanyu smiled. “This monk showed the scholar a mystical mirror. Within it lay a beach where a naked murdered woman’s corpse lay. Three passersby appeared: the first left after pitying her; the second covered her with his robe; the third buried her tenderly.”

“The third man showed true compassion!” Qiqi exclaimed.

“Indeed,” Guanyu nodded. “The monk revealed the corpse was the scholar’s fiancée in her past life. The scholar had been the second man—his robe a debt repaid through their brief betrothal. Her true destined spouse was the third man who’d given her rest. Enlightened, the scholar recovered.”

“So short?” Qiqi complained. “Their fates seem cruel.”

Wang Xiaorong mused, “Past lives dictate present bonds. Our meeting must surpass mere burial.”

“Perhaps we’ve been lovers across lifetimes,” Guanyu chuckled.

“Exactly!” Wang Xiaorong agreed. “Our bond is eternal, unlike that tragic scholar.”

Qiqi pouted. “Tell another! This one’s too brief.”

Guanyu sighed. “We agreed one story.”

“Rules change!” Qiqi declared. “A longer tale till dawn!”

Wang Xiaorong joined the plea. “One more, please.”

Relenting, Guanyu began anew: “A spider dwelled for millennia on a temple beam, absorbing spiritual energy from incense. When Buddha visited, he posed a riddle: ‘What’s life’s greatest treasure?’”

“The spider answered: ‘The unattained and the lost.’ Buddha smiled and departed. Millenniums passed with identical queries and replies until...” Guanyu paused dramatically.

“Here we go again!” Qiqi groaned. “Endless cycles?”

Wang Xiaorong glared. “Let him finish!”

Ignoring them, Guanyu continued: “One day, wind blew dewdrop nectar onto the spider’s web. Enthralled by its beauty, the spider cherished it until another gale swept it away. Heartbroken, the spider mourned when Buddha returned.”

“Same question?” Qiqi guessed.

“Must you?” Wang Xiaorong snapped.

Guanyu resumed: “Buddha sent the spider to be reborn as Zhuer, a minister’s daughter. At sixteen, she attended a banquet honoring scholar Gan Lu—the dewdrop’s incarnation. But Princess Changfeng also sought his favor...”

“A love triangle!” Qiqi cried.

Enraged, Wang Xiaorong lunged with a cloth. “I’ll silence you myself!”

“Mercy!” Qiqi squealed. “I’ll behave! What happens to Zhuer?”

**Chapter 5044: No Interruptions**

Guanyu watched the scuffle amusedly before continuing: “Zhuer and Gan Lu shared glances of recognition, yet he courted Princess Changfeng. Distraught, Zhuer nearly starved until Buddha appeared...”

**Chapter 5045: Deliberate Provocations**

Wang Xiaorong wrestled Qiqi, who gasped between laughs: “Don’t you care if Zhuer dies?”

“You’ll learn nothing if I throttle you first!” Wang Xiaorong retorted, the cloth hovering near Qiqi’s mouth.

Guanyu’s laughter filled the room as moonlight bathed the chaotic scene, the spider’s tale momentarily forgotten in the living drama unfolding.
