“Hmph, quite the imposing presence. Today, I want to see how you plan to take him away!” A middle-aged man suddenly walked through the door, unremarkable in appearance, yet his mere presence exuded an oppressive aura.

“And who are you?” Li Jing looked at the newcomer, an uneasy feeling rising in his heart. Before he could speak further, the man produced a document from his hand.

When Li Jing saw the document, his pupils contracted as he muttered in shock, “National Security Bureau?”

“This man is under my jurisdiction. You know what to do!” The middle-aged man declared in a tone that brooked no opposition.

Li Jing’s face darkened. “This man has committed crimes. This is against protocol!”

“What crimes?” the middle-aged man asked.

“He... engaged in a brawl and injured multiple people!” Li Jing gritted his teeth.

“A brawl? One person counts as a brawl?” The man scoffed.

Li Jing’s expression stiffened. “But he did injure people!”

“Did he? This matter requires thorough investigation, but it’s none of your concern now. Leave!” The man waved dismissively.

“But—” Li Jing tried to protest, but was cut off.

“Enough. You lack the authority to obstruct the National Security Bureau.” The middle-aged man’s patience wore thin.

Li Jing’s expression shifted, but he finally sighed inwardly. Today, he’d failed. He hadn’t anticipated that a nobody like Guan Yu could provoke such a figure—his intel had been flawed.

“Uncuff him. We’re leaving!” Li Jing ordered, releasing Guan Yu and departing with the scapegoat.

Guan Yu massaged his wrists, glancing at Wen Qing. He knew his current influence couldn’t mobilize the National Security Bureau—this intervention must be Wen Qing’s doing.

Wen Qing examined the red marks on his wrists. “Did they hurt you?”

Guan Yu smiled tenderly. “Only I hurt them. Those on the floor are proof!”

Wen Qing chuckled, her gaze affectionate. “You!”

Guan Yu turned to the middle-aged man. “Thank you for today.”

The man laughed heartily. “Trivial matters. Wen Qing was worried sick.”

He then addressed Wen Qing. “I’ll take my leave. Don’t forget to send my regards to your grandfather.”

Wen Qing nodded. “I will.”

As they left, Guan Yu resisted questioning Wen Qing’s background. Her secrets mattered less than her being his woman.

“Aren’t you curious about my family?” Wen Qing asked slyly.

“Curious, but I’ll wait until I’m strong enough to earn their approval,” Guan Yu replied.

Wen Qing’s smile brightened. “I believe in you.”

Suddenly, Guan Yu halted. Ahead stood Yang Yang.

“Fancy meeting you here. Still coveting my wife?” Guan Yu mocked.

Yang Yang’s smile froze. “You overestimate yourself.”

“Here to gloat?” Guan Yu’s gaze sharpened as he noticed two men beside Yang Yang.

“Guan Yu, meet Jiang Ziqi, Mo Ling’s fiancé!” one declared.

Guan Yu’s posture tensed. Jiang Ziqi’s timing was too coincidental—this man had orchestrated the earlier frame-up.

“Was it you?” Wen Qing demanded.

“Yes,” Jiang Ziqi admitted dismissively.

“Apologize!” Wen Qing insisted.

“Impossible,” Jiang Ziqi sneered.

Wen Qing’s voice turned icy. “Apologize, or face consequences.”

Jiang Ziqi’s face darkened. “You’d choose him over our circle?”

“He’s my husband!” Wen Qing retorted.

Jiang Ziqi sneered at Guan Yu. “Relying on women to survive?”

Guan宇 stepped forward. “You’re Mo Ling’s fiancé? Well, I’m her man.”

Jiang Ziqi’s fists clenched. “This is just the beginning. Survive this, and you might become a worthy opponent.”

“Anytime,” Guan宇 retorted.

As they left, Yang Yang glared with murderous intent.

In the car, Wen Qing pinched Guan宇’s waist. “Explain who Mo Ling is!”

“She’s not from your circle?” Guan宇 feigned innocence.

“Don’t play dumb!” Wen Qing pouted. “Who. Is. She?”
