“Why should I be the one to find someone for him? Where would I even meet women who’d seem suitable?” Lü Mei thought irritably. Still, for Guan Yu’s sake, she’d try her best. “Fine, I’ll handle this,” she said aloud, “but don’t expect instant results.”

“But I’m in a hurry!” Wei Hongwei protested urgently.

“Hurry your head off! I need time to pick properly. If I find someone unsuitable, your dear Brother Guan will hold me accountable. Who’ll take responsibility then?” Lü Mei protested coyly.

Wei Hongwei shook his head dramatically. “Alright then. I’ll wait for our campus belle to find me a better half. Off to the cafeteria I go!” Internally, he was elated. The goddess every male student idolized was personally arranging his love life! The prestige if this got out would be immense. Hah! He’d be legendary.

As Wei reached the classroom door, Guan Yu’s voice froze him. “Wei Hongwei, remember this – if a fourth person learns of this, I’ll ensure you die a bachelor.”

The threat of eternal singlehood nearly made Wei wet himself. “It won’t happen! I swear no fourth soul will know!”

“Keep that big mouth shut. Now scram.” Guan Yu’s irritation was palpable. Wei realized his mistake in telling Lü Mei about Yang Conghan – Guan Yu clearly knew. Never again would he act behind Guan Yu’s back. The man was terrifyingly perceptive.

Meanwhile, Lü Mei calculated: “Finding Wei a girlfriend could strengthen ties with him. Since he’s closest to Guan Yu, maintaining this channel could prove useful. Very well, this lady shall procure him a beauty.”

Unaware of Lü Mei’s machinations, Guan Yu continued eating. After the meal, as Wang Shu cleared the containers, Lü Mei produced a box from her bag containing a sleek new phone. “I bought this for you yesterday. It was my birthday, but I didn’t mention it, thinking you might be busy. Had spare time, so…”

Guan Yu felt a pang. Lü Mei, heiress of the prestigious Lü family, had humbled herself thus for him. No wonder she’d been pouting earlier.

Pulling her close, he murmured, “I don’t know who I was before amnesia, but now I see my woman’s greatness. I vow to host a grand birthday celebration for you.” He kissed her forehead tenderly.

Lü Mei nestled contentedly against him. The party mattered less than his words.

“Do you like it? It’s the latest model. I got matching ones – white for me, black for you.” She produced an identical device, bouncing with excitement.

“Black and white pairing again? Charming.” Guan Yu swapped his dead phone’s SIM card into the new device. Upon booting, thirty-odd messages flooded in – all from Lan Yu, alternating between curses and complaints about his unreachability.

“How’s Yang Conghan’s father?” Lü Mei suddenly asked. As fellow heiress, her awareness of the Yang patriarch’s qi deviation crisis wasn’t surprising.

“Should recover soon,” Guan Yu answered absently, fiddling with the phone.

“Father mentioned… that women like Xue Jing, Lan Yu, Ah Mei, Yang Conghan, and I are but fragments of your past life. He forbade our relationship, saying you’re no ordinary student… But I don’t care! Whether mundane or extraordinary, I’ll follow you if you keep me in your heart.”

“The past is lost to me. Whether memories return or not, you’re precious.” His tenderness melted her. She buried her face in his chest, radiant.

As class time approached, Jia Bo rushed in breathlessly. “Brother Guan! Wei’s getting beaten in the cafeteria!”

Guan Yu sprinted toward the commotion. “What happened?” he demanded mid-run.

“Wei saw Taekwondo practitioners sparring, boasted they couldn’t match your pinky, then got jumped,” Jia Bo panted.

That troublemaker Wei! At the cafeteria entrance, several youths were kicking the curled form. “HALT!” Guan Yu’s thunderous shout, infused with qi, stunned all present.

Helping Wei up, Guan Yu assessed superficial injuries. “Perfect timing, Brother Guan! These amateurs dared disrespect your skills!” Wei slurred through swollen lips.

Handing Wei to Jia Bo, Guan Yu coldly addressed the assailants. “Who struck first?”

A lanky, horse-faced youth stepped forward. “Me. You’re Guan Yu?”

Before anyone blinked, Guan Yu’s flying kick sent the youth sprawling. Gasps erupted – he’d actually attacked Feng Shao, scion of the Feng family!

As spectators gathered, Guan Yu dusted his pants. “Future grievances come to me. Touch my brothers again, consequences will follow. This is your warning.”

Turning to leave, he heard Feng Shao’s enraged roar: “Fuck his mother! Attack! I’ll take responsibility!”

The lackeys charged. Though trained, they were no match. Within moments, Guan Yu had them groaning on the floor.

“With skills like this, you’d shame Kaihuang in the city tournament. Go home!” Guan Yu scoffed.

Applause interrupted. A student emerged from the crowd – Chen Tianxiao, whose aura shocked Guan Yu: a genuine Second-Class Adept, rare even nationally.

“Impressive words. But with your skills, avoiding the tournament wastes Kaihuang’s chance at glory,” Chen challenged.

Their exchange revealed the competition’s hidden depths – rumored First-Class Adepts might participate. Intrigued, Guan Yu agreed to enroll.

Post-class, Chen delivered Guan Yu’s tournament credentials. Departing campus in Xue Jing’s car, Guan Yu groaned seeing Lan Yu blocking the road, tearful after waiting hours.

“Your romantic debts haunt you,” Xue Jing mocked. “Stole hearts then neglected them.”

Resigned, Guan Yu approached. “I was getting tournament paperwork. Couldn’t meet earlier.”

Lan Yu’s tears transformed to joy. “Waited ten afternoons gladly!” she claimed, demanding a hug. Guan obliged, carrying her princess-style as Wei drove by, his battered face provoking her laughter.

Later, at the Xue residence, Ah Mei awaited – another ghost from Guan Yu’s forgotten past. The gentle starlet’s presence hinted at deeper entanglements yet unresolved.
