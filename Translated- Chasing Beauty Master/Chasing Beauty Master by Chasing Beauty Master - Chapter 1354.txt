“This matter was just relayed to me by West Peach Blossom. Over the past year, Monster Demon Cave hasn’t merely operated a tavern in Qujiang City for nothing. We’ve planted informants in many prominent households. Echo Pavilion, being one of Qujiang’s most renowned taverns frequented by dignitaries, ensures our intelligence network remains exceptionally sharp.”

The Left Envoy was astounded. How could they possibly know even this? Could it be that the entrance to Treasure Mountain lies within the Qin Estate? Surely they couldn’t have uncovered that as well? Unthinkable!

However, members of the Cloud Azure Sect were also stationed in the Qin Estate. If they had detected anomalies during their stay, it wouldn’t be surprising.

The Left Envoy chuckled, “I never imagined Elder Sister’s information network to be so thorough. Your knowledge of this matter is truly admirable. As for why we’ve stationed operatives in the Qin Estate… I’m afraid that’s not something I can disclose.”

West Willow smiled. “The Left Envoy has always been the Demon Lord’s most capable aide. Yet now that Red Lotus Sect members have been captured by the City Lord’s forces, does the Envoy plan to visit the City Lord’s residence?”

Of course, Monster Demon Cave had spies within the City Lord’s mansion too. While other locations might prove challenging, in Qujiang City, no event escaped Monster Demon Cave’s watchful eyes.

It appeared Monster Demon Cave wasn’t as incompetent as presumed. Even the Demon Lord might have underestimated their capabilities. Perhaps they even had informants within the Demon Soul Sect itself.

“Hahaha! When the City Lord’s son was beaten, I merely paid my respects under a different guise,” the Left Envoy replied with a laugh. “I thank Elder Sister for today’s hospitality. With matters pressing, I shall take my leave but will return to visit another day.”

“No need for farewells,” West Willow stated impassively.

The Left Envoy made no move to pay for the meal, confident no objections would arise. He strode out briskly, knowing further stay would yield no advantage. West Willow’s unyielding stance against submitting to Demon Soul Sect made lingering pointless. Better to report developments to the Demon Lord immediately.

After his departure, West Willow’s composure crumbled. Her earlier defiance had been mere pretense—years without confronting Demon Soul Sect had left lingering trepidation. Had the Left Envoy resorted to force, Monster Demon Cave would have been powerless. Fortunately, they’d managed to send him away. Likely, the Left Envoy would consult the Demon Lord, buying temporary respite.

When West Peach Blossom hurried in, she found West Willow guzzling wine at the table. “How did it go? Did events unfold as planned?”

“*Hic!*” West Willow belched unceremoniously, exhaling deeply. “That Left Envoy… Decades serving the Demon Lord have steeped him in such oppressive aura I could barely breathe!”

“Quick, tell me—what was his stance?” West Peach Blossom fretted over potential complications or hidden schemes from the Demon Lord.

“I said my piece. How the Demon Lord receives it, I cannot guess.” West Willow’s speech slurred slightly from intoxication. “When I revealed our two latest discoveries, his shock was evident. This might force Demon Soul Sect to reevaluate us.”

“Excellent!” West Peach Blossom exclaimed. “If the Demon Lord holds his hand temporarily, we still have hope for the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.”

After leaving Echo Pavilion, the Left Envoy reached Camp Town to dispatch a urgent missive to the Demon Lord via Demon Soul Sect operatives, detailing Monster Demon Cave’s activities. Instructing his men to monitor Echo Pavilion, he departed for urgent business.

Outside Qin Estate’s gates, a lively scene unfolded as the household recruited new guards. Though normally coveted for their superior待遇 compared to even the City Lord’s residence, last night’s mysterious deaths of over a dozen people deterred many applicants, leaving mostly spectators.

Steward Sun ostensibly managed the recruitment, but Demon Soul Sect plants already infiltrated the crowd. Having changed attire in Camp Town, the Left Envoy now sought entry as a guard—uneasy about potential interference from Cloud Azure Sect members mentioned by West Willow.

Blending into the crowd in commoner’s garb, he avoided notice. To bypass lengthy assessments, he approached a two-meter-long stone lion flanking the gates, beside which lay a boulder.

As Steward Sun spotted him, the Left Envoy quickly announced, “I’m here to apply. Will I suffice?” Activating a wrist-mounted artifact, he unleashed a dark arc that shattered the boulder explosively.

Gasps erupted. “Heavens! Such power!” the crowd murmured at this display of mystical prowess.

“Does this qualify me?” the Left Envoy boomed jovially, his spectacle serving dual purposes: impressing observers and securing seamless entry.

**Chapter 3501: Your Word Means Nothing**

Recognizing the signal, Steward Sun fawned, “Most qualified indeed! Qin Estate desperately needs talents like you. Please sign here, review our rules and待遇. Once agreed, you’ll be enlisted.”

Normally, Qin Estate’s rigorous vetting included background checks and skill verification. But urgent needs prompted streamlined hiring under Steward Sun’s direction—allowing thirty-two Demon Soul Sect plants to infiltrate for that night’s operation.

At dinner, Lady Qin dined in her son Qin Taijin’s chambers, the bedridden youth being fed congee by Maid Yan. “Steward Sun, instruct the new guards on rules and station them outside tonight,” she ordered.

“My Lady,” Steward Sun cautioned, “their backgrounds remain unverified. For safety, let me screen them tonight and deploy them tomorrow.”

Maid Yan concurred, “Steward Sun prioritizes the family’s welfare. Existing guards suffice for tonight.”

Lady Qin acquiesced. Meanwhile, Guan Yu pondered in his quarters—today marked the third day since sending Second-to-Wolf to Lin Qiaoqiao’s town. If all went well, they’d reach A City tomorrow.

“I wonder how things fare at home,” he murmured, worrying particularly about Zhang Han—targeted by the Yang Family. A knock interrupted: “Guan Yu? Are you there?”

Sicily entered as he opened the door. “I saw Steward Sun lecturing new guards. They’re likely Demonic Sect members,” Guan Yu whispered.

“Let’s hope no major trouble erupts,” Sicily replied. “Why brood alone?”

“Just homesick.”

“But weren’t you an orphan at Cloud Azure Sect? Who awaits you?”

Guan Yu sidestepped mentioning his harem. “Two elder sisters—Du Xiaojuan and Liu Shilei. Not blood-related, but family.”

Sicily pressed until Guan Yu fabricated an orphan-adoption tale. “Then why leave such a home to cultivate?” she wondered. “Spiritual training could take decades!”

Guan Yu deflected, recounting how Cloud Azure disciples had arrested him and friends after vanquishing a village monster—actually the mayor’s transformed son, protected by the community.

As Sicily listened raptly, Guan Yu described confronting the toxic mushroom-tree lair, battling the creature, and exposing the mayor’s complicity—events Sicily vaguely recalled from past travels with her master.

**Chapter 3502: Reasons**

“You were brought in by Front Peak’s Ma Xiao?” Sicily marveled. “But why would they arrest you?”

Guan Yu explained the monster crisis—a village terrorized by livestock and human disappearances. His investigation led to a poisonous tree growing mid-stream, its leaves toxic. Pursuing the beast to this arboreal hideout, he’d clashed with protective villagers before slaying the creature—exposing the mayor’s monstrous offspring.

“The mayor’s son?!” Sicily gasped. “Was the mayor also a monster?”

“The village believed the tree sacred,” Guan Yu continued. “But the creature was human once—warped by the toxic tree’s influence. The mayor shielded his son’s transformation until we intervened.”

Sicily shivered yet urged him onward, mirroring horror fans torn between fear and fascination. Guan Yu likened her to Lü Mei, who dreaded yet devoured ghost stories.

Thus unfolded tales of mystical trees, hidden monsters, and village conspiracies—all threads weaving through the cultivation world’s endless intrigues.
