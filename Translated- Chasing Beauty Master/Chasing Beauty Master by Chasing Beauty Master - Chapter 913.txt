Jin Hua examined the photo and found the person unrecognizable. Guan Yu asked curiously, "I'm confused. Do you need to see the poisoner's face when administering antidotes?"

"Oh dear, what a shame for such a young and handsome lad," Jin Hua remarked inexplicably while staring at the photo. "How could he commit such acts? Lusting after a girl's beauty and harboring wicked intentions—what kind of master raised him?"

"Could you elaborate?" Guan Yu asked, baffled. Second to Wolf and Ah Cai grew even more curious. Ah Cai thought Jin Hua, being eccentric herself, might have unconventional methods.

Jin Hua, having checked Feng Xihu's pulse, nodded decisively. "This poison is potent. Instead of learning proper skills, this youth chose harmful arts."

"Let's cut to the chase—can you neutralize the poison or not?" Guan Yu pressed impatiently.

"Hmph! Such petty tricks can't thwart me. Of course I can cure it. But you must hurry to find that lad. If I'm right, he’s likely my master’s disciple. The aphrodisiac used on Feng Xihu and you was my master’s exclusive formula," Jin Hua stated mysteriously.

Guan Yu immediately grasped the implication. "So that male waiter might be your master’s disciple? Finding him could lead us to your master?" As he spoke, he inwardly lamented: *Had I known earlier! Now that I’ve severed his disciple’s finger and had him arrested, will her master still help us?*

"Exactly. This youth must be my master’s new apprentice. He surely knows her whereabouts." After draping a blanket over Feng Xihu, Jin Hua added, "Go find him quickly. I’ll head out to purchase herbs. The antidote requires specific ingredients, or dizziness may linger as a side effect."

Turning to Second to Wolf and Ah Cai, she instructed, "Brother Second, you’ll have to stay another day. Guard Miss Feng’s safety."

Second to Wolf shrugged. "No problem. A day’s delay matters little."

"But the suspect’s already in police custody. Should we interrogate him there?" Guan Yu asked.

Jin Hua shot him a puzzled glance. "Why would he be arrested? Feng Xihu’s unconscious. Did *you* call the police?"

Guan Yu stammered awkwardly, "Y-yes. I didn’t plan to, but after discovering my own poisoning, I couldn’t subdue him alone."

"Remarkable," Jin Hua exclaimed. "All these years, you’ve scorned the police. Now, because Feng Xihu’s an officer, you’ve suddenly developed faith in them? Since when do *you* report crimes? This isn’t your style!" Her relentless critique left Guan Yu mortified.

Guan Yu recognized the complications. This promising lead now risked ruin—not only had he maimed the master’s disciple, but also gotten him arrested. "What’s done is done. Will your master really be so petty?" he ventured weakly.

"That’s my *grandmaster*. Whether she’s petty remains to be seen. For now, let’s buy herbs. Ah Cai here nearly emptied our stock." Jin Hua strode off to freshen up.

Second to Wolf sidled up to Guan Yu. "Honestly, Feng’s sister is quite the looker. Last night, did you two...? As a man, surely your resolve wavered?"

"She’s Feng’s sister—my sworn rival’s kin. How appetizing is that? Besides, my home’s brimming with beauties. Need I say more about my self-control?" Guan Yu retorted arrogantly.

"Pah! Everyone knows homegrown flowers pale beside wild blooms. ‘Cherish your own children, covet others’ wives’—that’s the truth. Don’t pretend you didn’t entertain thoughts."

Guan Yu rolled his eyes, refusing further engagement. Second to Wolf’s demeanor shifted unpredictably—serious one moment, irreverent the next.

Returning in pristine white attire, Jin Hua’s alabaster skin and striking features momentarily mesmerized Ah Cai. Disgusted by his gaze, she stomped his foot.

"Yowch!" Ah Cai yelped, snapping back to reality. Jin Hua scolded, "I’m your elder brother’s woman! Keep staring, and I’ll pluck your eyes out!"

Trembling, Ah Cai vowed, "Understood! Never again!" He resolved to restrain himself—Jin Hua’s allure was dangerous, and her retribution unpredictable.

Second to Wolf interceded cheerfully. "Come now, Jin Hua! Your beauty’s meant to be admired. Ah Cai’s just a lad—can’t blame him for being captivated."

"Even so! His lecherous gaze offends me. Next time, those eyes become medicinal ingredients!" she threatened.

Guan Yu stepped in. "Ease up. Ah Cai’s my sworn brother."

"Your brother dares eye his sister-in-law like prey? Were he a stranger, I’d teach him manners!" Privately, Jin Hua relished the admiration—what woman didn’t crave such validation? Her sternness was mere theatrics.

Softening, she told Ah Cai, "Respect your elders. But if you crave beauty..." She gestured to the sofa where Feng Xihu lay. "That one’s fair game."

"Enough jests," Guan Yu interjected, taking her hand. "We must hurry."

At the police station, inquiries revealed the nightshift officer was off-duty. No one acknowledged arresting a one-fingered waiter. Suspecting the restaurant’s surveillance might hold clues, Guan Yu and Jin Hua returned to their previous booth.

Noticing a ceiling camera, Guan Yu approached a waitress. "I’m a private investigator. May I speak to your manager about reviewing footage?"

After a polite delay, the waitress led them upstairs to Manager Yuewei—a cultivator with sharp eyes. Guan Yu introduced himself and Jin Hua as detectives seeking footage for a case.

Jin Hua interjected smoothly, "Last night’s waiter mentioned having no change. I promised to settle today. Is he available?"

The manager, Yuewei, frowned. "We mysteriously closed this morning. Let’s check the footage."

As Guan Yu feigned retrieving credentials, Jin Hua whispered, "What game are you playing?"

"Adapting," he winked. Their charade continued—a dance of wit and necessity, each step unraveling the poisoner’s trail.
