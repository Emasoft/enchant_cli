The woman who had been holding the girl earlier moved closer to the young man and asked, “Do you recognize this car? How much does it cost? When my husband returns from working in the city, I’ll have him buy one too. It’s really beautiful.”

The young man glanced at her as if she were an idiot, shook his head, and said helplessly, “Working in the city? Coming back to buy one?” He pointed at the car while speaking, almost unable to believe his ears, wondering if he had misheard.

He then pursed his lips and added, “Even if you worked ten lifetimes in the city, you couldn’t afford this. This Bentley Continental is clearly the top luxury edition. It costs at least over ten million yuan.”

At the mention of “ten million,” the chattering crowd fell into stunned silence. The astronomical figure seemed to spin endlessly in their minds, reverberating like an echo.

A grubby-faced child reached out to touch the pristine white car body, only to be yanked back by an adult. “Son, we can’t touch that! If it gets damaged, we’d never afford to repay them even with our lives!” the parent admonished.

“Ten million… how much is that really?” a villager suddenly asked, as if the concept had never existed in their world.

These mountain-dwelling folk rarely interacted with the outside world. Their only glimpse of vehicles came during harvest season when trucks passed through to collect crops. In their eyes, no car—no matter how fancy—could surpass the value of those massive container trucks. After all, how could something as small as Guan Yu’s sedan compare?

Yet the price revelation left everyone genuinely shocked. Qing Linger stepped out of the car, greeting relatives one by one. “Aunt, Uncle, Cousin… Mom!” She finally threw herself into Aunt Qing’s embrace.

Having not seen Aunt Qing for months and the Qu family for years, the reunion felt particularly warm. “Linger, you look thinner,” Aunt Qing murmured, her aged, calloused hands gently smoothing Linger’s hair.

“I’m doing well, Mom. Everyone treats me kindly, especially Brother Guan Yu. You needn’t worry,” Linger reassured, using Guan Yu’s name to ease her mother’s concerns.

“Sister! I’m so glad you made it!” Qu Meimei exclaimed, clutching Linger’s hands. “Is this car my wedding vehicle? Tomorrow I’ll ride in a ten-million-yuan bridal car—it must be the grandest wedding our villages have seen in decades!”

Linger grinned. “Exactly! Not only is the car beautiful, but the driver’s handsome too. Satisfied?” She playfully stuck her tongue out at Guan Yu through the window.

“More than satisfied! Thank you, Sister!” Meimei bounced with excitement, already envisioning her legendary wedding procession.

“You’ve grown so lovely, Meimei.”

“Not compared to you!” Meimei leaned in conspiratorially. “Is that driver your boyfriend?” The mere thought of marrying such wealth left her dizzy.

“Don’t be silly!” Linger’s cheeks flushed crimson.

A limping aunt approached. “Linger, invite your friend inside! Don’t keep him standing out here.”

Nodding, Linger called, “Brother Guan, please bring the gifts in.” She retrieved her MacBook from the passenger seat—not to show off, but because Yang Conghan had recently gifted it, making it too precious to leave unattended.

Carrying two large gift bags, Guan Yu entered the house where Aunt Qing ceremoniously invited him to sit on the kang—the heated brick bed symbolizing honor in rural homes. “Guan Yu, please make yourself comfortable. We’re so grateful you came.”

Chapter 2215: I’ve Set My Eyes on Him

The spacious farmhouse buzzed with activity. Among the crowd of rustic-dressed village girls, Linger stood out like a crane among chickens. The village chief’s daughter, comparatively better dressed, eyed Linger’s laptop with awe. “Is that a real MacBook? Can we see it?”

Without hesitation, Linger produced the sleek white device, sparking gasps. “So beautiful!” Meimei breathed. “Like you, Sister!”

“They say these cost over ten thousand yuan,” the chief’s daughter whispered. Adults nearby shook their heads in disbelief. “That’s four pigs’ worth of corn!” one muttered. “City folk luxuries,” another sighed.

“Brother Guan bought this for you, didn’t he?” Meimei teased. “You two must be close!”

Linger’s face burned. “He’s my boss, nothing more!”

Seizing the moment, the chief’s daughter boldly declared, “Introduce me then! I want him!” Ignoring Linger’s warnings about Guan Yu’s five stunning city-dwelling lovers, the girl insisted. “Just tell him I’m interested!”

As Linger reluctantly agreed, an unexpected pang struck her heart. Why did offering Guan Yu to others suddenly ache? She hastily showed photos of Xue Jing, Lü Mei, Zhang Han, A’mei, and Yang Conghan—each more breathtaking than the last. The village girls fell silent, any hopes dashed by comparison.

Chapter 2216: Favoritism

Aunt Qing approached with fruit, intercepted by giggling girls. “This is for our guest!” she scolded playfully, swatting Meimei’s thieving hand.

“Auntie’s biased!” Meimei pouted as the chief’s daughter seized the tray, batting her eyelashes at Guan Yu. “Handsome, have some fruit? May I sit here?”

Though aware of her designs, Guan Yu politely indulged her until gift-giving provided an escape. He distributed woolens to the elders, saving a golden bracelet for Meimei. The bride-to-be gaped at the 20,000-yuan chain, speechless with joy.

As Guan Yu moved through the crowd, the chief’s daughter shadowed him, while Linger wrestled with conflicting emotions. Her casual mention of Guan Yu’s harem had unwittingly revealed more than intended—both to the villagers and herself.
