Fang Su proposed, “How about this—after the auction concludes tomorrow, I’ll contact Bill Lin. I plan to stay at the Feng residence. This way, I can maintain closer communication with him and network with the Jianghu figures he associates with. Given the Feng family’s prestige, even Guanyu wouldn’t dare barge in recklessly, right?”

Master Fang nodded in agreement. “That is indeed a good plan.”

After further discussion, Master Fang abruptly shifted topics to Liu Chan. “Son, this girlfriend of yours seems quite impressive. Not only is she strikingly beautiful, but she also appears... skilled in certain arts. You certainly know how to enjoy yourself.”

Fang Su chuckled darkly. “She’s passable. Adequate for temporary amusement.”

“If you intend to stay at the Feng residence, it’s best not to drag her along as deadweight. Focus on crucial matters—keeping a woman by your side during serious affairs is utterly inappropriate.”

Noticing his father’s suggestive tone, Fang Su raised an eyebrow and swiftly offered, “If Father fancies Liu Chan, I’ll have her stay behind to accompany you.”

Liu Chan, after all, was a woman from the bars—the type who’d do anything for money. Though she’d recently been tricked into the scene by her so-called sisters, Fang Su knew she was little more than a worn-out plaything. Such a woman could be casually handed over to his father without qualms; he’d had his fill of her these past days.

Master Fang stiffened momentarily before shaking his head like a rattle-drum. “Absolutely not! How could I encroach on my own son’s woman? Though your filial gesture is appreciated, this feels improper. She is, after all, your companion.”

Fang Su adopted an understanding demeanor. “It’s no great matter. As your son, shouldn’t we share the finer things? Don’t overthink it.”

Truthfully, Fang Su had grown bored after days of toying with this imitation of Lin Qiaoqiao—a pale shadow of the woman who truly captivated him. If his father desired her, it made for a convenient favor.

Caught off guard by his son’s libertine generosity, Master Fang mumbled awkwardly before hastily changing the subject.

After further conversation, Fang Su left the study and returned to the living room. Sitting beside Liu Chan, he whispered into her ear.

Liu Chan’s eyes widened in shock, though her expression betrayed no anger. Locking gazes with Fang Su, she thought bitterly, *This family’s depravity knows no bounds—the son finishes his play, then passes me to the father. After all my efforts to please him these days...*

Yet her mercenary heart remained unperturbed. Money ruled her world. If servicing the old man brought financial rewards—or unexpected windfalls—so be it.

Affecting demureness, she lowered her head and wordlessly approached the study. Upon entering, she deliberately swayed her hips. “Uncle, Fang Su mentioned you’re feeling weary. He asked me to give you a massage to ease your tension.”

Master Fang’s eyes gleamed. “Exactly so. Close the door and come quickly.” After obediently locking the door, Liu Chan approached the salivating patriarch.

Resolve hardened her gaze. *Pamper this old fool well, and riches will flow. With his perpetual bachelor status, perhaps I can even secure a position in the Fang household...*

“Uncle, where exactly are you—” Her question died as Master Fang yanked her forward...

At dawn’s first light, Guanyu and Xue Jing arrived at the Yang family’s auction house. Second-to-Wolf already waited there, singularly focused on locating Mountain Hermit Ying.

The elusive hermit had become Second-to-Wolf’s white whale. Having promised Guanyu resolution within a week, yet failing after half a month, his pride demanded redemption.

Dressed in a black suit with gaudy gold chains, Second-to-Wolf resembled a nouveau riche scion—a far cry from his usual disheveled appearance with a massive blade slung over his shoulder.

Guanyu chuckled at the transformation. “You clean up surprisingly well, Brother Second. Certain she’ll come today?”

“Without doubt,” Second-to-Wolf replied, scanning the swelling crowd.

“Why such confidence?” Guanyu pressed. “Her injuries may still hinder her.”

“Greed drives her,” Second-to-Wolf shook his head. “After Flying Sky Wolf sold his map fragment for fifteen million, every treasure hunter’s appetite is whetted. With another fragment auctioning today, her avarice will override caution.”

Guanyu nodded. “Then today’s your chance. Don’t let her slip away again.”

“Begone,” Second-to-Wolf grumbled. “Stop distracting me.”

In the third-floor VIP lounge resembling a banquet hall, Guanyu sampled hors d'oeuvres with Xue Jing when Yang Conghan arrived, resplendent in a sapphire dress.

“Early for breakfast?” she teased.

“Amei sleeps late,” Guanyu grinned, offering her cake. “Join us?”

As they nibbled delicacies, Guanyu inquired about auction logistics. “I’ll observe from backstage today. Too risky sitting openly.”

Yang Conghan arched an eyebrow. “With your skills?”

“Precautions prevent disasters,” he deflected, unaware she didn’t know about his lost cultivation. “Let my friend take my seat.”

By 8:30 AM, the auction hall brimmed with attendees. Second-to-Wolf occupied Guanyu’s designated spot while the latter monitored feeds in the control room—until discovering critical cameras were elsewhere.

A call to Yang Conghan redirected him to an underground surveillance den. Meanwhile, his attention snagged on Flying Sky Wolf gorging in the VIP area—Bill Lin’s proxy and Guanyu’s newest target.

As the clock ticked toward commencement, strategies crystallized. Today’s drama would unfold not just on the auction floor, but in shadows where ambition and vengeance collided.
