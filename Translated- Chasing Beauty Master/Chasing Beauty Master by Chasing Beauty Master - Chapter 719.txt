The upstairs consisted of private rooms that appeared suspended above massive aquarium tanks when viewed from the first floor. "Must be thrilling," Guan Yu mused.

A tall, lanky youth holding a wine glass approached loudly, "Well if it isn't Young Master Wei! Long time no see. What's kept you busy lately? Looks like you've put on another layer of flab."

"Still rotting away here every day, Da Ke?" Wei Hongwei retorted sharply. "How often do you actually catch sight of Yang Conghan? Keep this up and you'll drop dead here. Not worth it."

"Shut your dog mouth spewing no ivory!" Da Ke sneered. "My body's strong as ever. Get me two babes and I'll party all night!"

"With just your mouth?" Guan Yu interjected, thoroughly unimpressed.

Da Ke swaggered closer, eyeing Guan Yu like vermin. "Whose unlucky brat is this? Watch your tongue, bastard. This isn't your gutter to bark in."

Guan Yu's fist shot toward that detestable face. To his surprise, Da Ke slid backward like oil on water, evading the strike. "Nimble feet, maggot brain," Guan Yu remarked coolly as hostile gazes converged from the crowd.

"You looking to die?" Da Ke bristled.

"Take your circus elsewhere," Wei Hongwei cut in dismissively. "We've business here."

Chapter 1826: Three-to-One Odds

Wei Hongwei had brought Guan Yu to Hua Ye Club to find Han Qiao, while secretly hoping to glimpse Yang Conghan - City A's legendary beauty who made irregular appearances. Instead, they encountered trash upon entering.

"You picking fights today, Wei?" Da Ke jeered. "Should leash your attack dog. Might bite the wrong master."

The "dog" remark ignited fury. Guan Yu materialized behind Da Ke, hoisting him overhead before slamming the thug spine-first onto the floor. Gasps erupted as two lackeys scrambled to help their groaning leader.

Wei stared stunned. The crowd's shock stemmed not from the boldness, but the skill displayed - Da Ke was no amateur. Yet this youth had casually tossed him like refuse.

In Guan Yu's dictionary, "caution" didn't exist - only action. Those hostile glances now wavered. Da Ke, nursing his shoulder, recognized the mercy shown. Another inch of force would have shattered bones.

"Han Qiao! There you are!" Wei Hongwei's shout drew their attention to the bar area where Han Qiao sat surrounded.

Chapter 1827: Equal Footing

Approaching through the crowd, Han Qiao glared. "Here to harass me?"

"Just checking in," Guan Yu offered amiably.

Han Qiao's lip curled. "What? Did Lü Mei ditch you for real man?"

Guan Yu's expression frosted. "Came to invite you to dinner. Seems you're too busy fantasizing about Yang Conghan."

"Fuck off before I break every bone in your body!" Han Qiao roared, hurling a barstool.

The crowd erupted as Guan Yu danced through the chaos, deliberately luring Han Qiao's wild swings toward expensive decor. Antique vases and prized盆栽smashed in their wake. Onlookers began taking bets - three-to-one odds against the raging brute.

Chapter 1828: Legend Confirmed

"Enough!" A shrill voice halted the melee. The crowd parted for a wiry man whose eyes bulged upon recognizing Guan Yu. "Master Guan?!"

Hou Jinshun - Hua Ye's manager and a second-class pseudo-mutant - trembled with reverence. This was the legend who'd elevated him from street vermin.

As explanations flowed, Hou's face paled surveying the wreckage. "These were Yang Conghan's prized orchids! She'll have my head!"

Guan Yu shrugged. "I'll cover damages. Consider it charity for rabid dogs."

Hou whispered urgently: "Yang's beauty is no myth - but she moves like shadow. Even I only deal with her secretary."

Nearby, Han Qiao nursed a swollen face, seething yet silenced by Guan Yu's displayed might and Hou's deference. The crowd buzzed - rumors of Guan Yu's prowess proved inadequate next to reality's brilliance.
