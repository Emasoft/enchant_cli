The class had just ended, and students remained in the classroom. Guan Yu's deliberate provocation of their homeroom teacher sparked suppressed giggles among classmates.

Liu Shuowei's face twisted with rage as he snapped, "Such ill-breeding! Do you think you're qualified to criticize a teacher? Even the principal himself couldn't demand my time when I say I'm occupied. Hmph!"

Guan Yu, surprised by Liu's stubbornness, retorted, "An orphan's manners, you say? And you—an educator—utter such words. How cultured you must be! When did I criticize you? I merely sought discussion, yet you lied about being busy. Let the whole class judge: What fault lies with me? What right have you to question my upbringing?"

Refusing to prolong this futile argument, Liu Shuowei shot Guan Yu a venomous glare before clutching his textbooks and storming out. The unspoken tension hung thick—everyone knew Guan Yu was no ordinary student, daring enough to challenge Han Qiao.

"Damn it, still making eyes at me? Won't quit till he's cornered," Guan Yu muttered, turning to Wei Hongwei. "Brother Wei, lend me your phone. I'll treat you later."

Wei tossed his device over. "I'll hold you to that feast!"

Armed with the phone, Guan Yu headed to the seventh-floor faculty offices—exclusive territory for favored staff like Liu. Rumors swirled about Liu escorting a pretty Class 9 girl off-campus yesterday evening, likely another victim of his predation.

Bafflement gnawed at Guan Yu as he climbed. Why would girls surrender their virtue to this sleazy middle-aged predator? Liu might as well wear "SCAM ARTIST" branded on his forehead. The entire school knew his reputation, yet prey still walked into his trap.

The seventh floor lay tomb-silent. Guan Yu prowled past door plaques—Principal's Office, Academic Affairs, Conference Room—until spotting "Faculty Office" at the corridor's end. Frosted glass obscured the interior, but Guan Yu pressed a palm against the window. Channeling inner energy, he subtly clarified the adhesive film's opacity.

Inside sprawled a lavishly appointed office. Liu lounged in his leather chair, eyes closed but face twitching with restless energy. The man who'd pleaded busyness now idled shamelessly. Perfect. Guan Yu raised Wei's phone to document the hypocrisy.

"Piece of junk! Why's it locked?" Guan Yu hissed, fumbling with the device. Suddenly—

"Mmm...ah! Yes!"

Pornographic moans erupted at full volume. Guan Yu nearly dropped the phone. That idiot Wei had been watching explicit videos during class! The idiot must've yanked out his earphones when handing it over.

"Fucking hell! Trying to get me killed?" Guan Yu cursed, frantically silencing the video. Had Liu heard? Peering through the glass, he saw Liu glance around suspiciously before resuming... whatever.

Inside, Liu jiggled his mouse, illuminating a monitor. After navigating through nested folders, rows of video thumbnails appeared—all Japanese adult films. Guan Yu's lip curled. "This pervert's collection puts Wei's to shame. They'd be swapping files like trading cards."

Liu muttered darkly, "Stubborn Lü Mei. Refuse my invitation? I'll savor these alone... though I'll save the choicest clips to break your resistance."

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. The bastard planned to lure female students here with these vile materials!

Minutes later, Liu's face flushed crimson. His right hand vanished beneath the desk, body undulating rhythmically. "Now's the chance!" Guan Yu raised the phone—only to discover the frosted glass blurred the camera view. Desperate, he spotted an untainted sliver at the window's lower edge.

Adjusting angles, he captured three seconds of footage before Liu abruptly stilled. "Three seconds? That's all you've got?" Guan Yu sneered. "With that stamina, you still chase skirts?"

As Liu retrieved a box of... implements... from under the desk, Guan Yu snapped photos. The flash erupted like a lightning strike.

"WHO'S THERE?!" Liu roared, scrambling to hide his toys.

"Shit! Stupid flash!" Guan Yu cursed, then boldly knocked.

The door cracked open to Liu's ashen face. "You?!"

"Me. Apologies for interrupting your... leisure time." Guan Yu's smirk could curdle milk.

Liu's threat dripped venom: "Hand over the phone, and this never happened. Or else—"

"Or else what?" Guan Yu waved the device. "Two seconds of gold here. Pity it wasn't longer—but then, neither were you."

Liu's knuckles cracked audibly. Guan Yu blinked—beneath the sleaze lurked a third-tier variant! Yet when Liu unleashed his oppressive aura, Guan Yu stood unfazed, casually countering with his own energy surge that left Liu staggering.

"Don't bother," Guan Yu drawled. "Leak this footage, and your precious reputation evaporates. Even your principal crony can't save you then."

Defeated, Liu transformed into a simpering host. "Please, sit! Let's discuss like civilized—"

"Save it." Guan Yu eyed the luxurious decor. "How cozy you've got it. What's your hold over the principal?"

Liu squirmed. "He's... my wife's cousin. Helps that I... procure companions for him. A man in his position can't risk personal scandals."

Guan Yu's stomach turned. "So you pimp students? After 'breaking them in' yourself?"

"Necessary evil!" Liu whined. "Some girls demand... more than I can provide. The toys help. And they're well compensated!"

"Enough." Guan Yu's voice turned glacial. "This ends now. No more victims. Especially Lü Mei—stay away from her."

Liu nodded frantically. "Of course! Now the phone...?"

Guan Yu pocketed the device. "This stays as insurance. Cross me, and the whole school sees what a two-second wonder you are."
