“Open up, everyone gets paid,” the young man continued. “However, those managing these affairs are hall masters hired by the proprietors. Currently, I know of three: one oversees provisions, another handles finances, and the third manages sanitation and miscellaneous tasks. All trifling matters fall under these three hall masters’ jurisdiction.”

Guan Yu remarked, “I hadn’t realized your proprietors were so enigmatic. The Swordless Inn beneath Swordless Manor is clearly no ordinary establishment. So only these three hall masters have met your proprietors, is that right?”

“So it’s said,” the youth replied. “But no one else claims to have seen them. We don’t even know if the proprietors are male or female. Most visitors here don’t ask as many questions as you. People usually take a room, prepare themselves, then ascend the mountain to challenge the Swordless Immortal. That’s all.”

**Chapter 4110: The Legend (Part 1)**

Guan Yu nodded thoughtfully. The Swordless Inn’s immense scale and undisturbed operation spoke volumes. Martial artists of great renown frequented this place, maintaining an unspoken truce against causing trouble. Beyond imperial jurisdiction, this establishment represented a steady, enduring enterprise.

The proprietors’ secrecy intrigued him. Calculating based on mid-tier room rates—fifteen taels per night for a hundred occupied rooms—the inn’s daily income would reach fifteen hundred taels. Annual profits after expenses could easily surpass five hundred thousand taels. Such astronomical wealth accumulated over years would make the proprietors unimaginably rich, yet their identities remained shrouded in mystery. The paradox defied belief.

Pressing further, Guan Yu asked, “How’s the food here? Do guests pay extra for meals?”

“Meals are complimentary,” the youth explained. “Three daily servings for room key holders. Diners may eat their fill from diverse dishes tailored to their tastes—exclusive to lodgers, of course.”

Guan Yu approved. Free meals meant the inn’s actual earnings likely exceeded his initial estimate. With such stable income, the proprietors’ absence made sense. This self-sustaining enterprise required minimal oversight—hire competent managers, maintain Swordless Immortal’s undefeated status, and the golden goose kept laying eggs indefinitely. Why would the owners linger when they could enjoy limitless wealth elsewhere?

Meanwhile, Zou Wangye (Prince Zou) finalized accommodations through Zou Wuhui. “Your Highness, we’ve secured an entire three-story building. This arrangement facilitates mutual support among our party.”

The prince nodded. “Excellent. Concentrating our group prevents scattered mischief.” His concerns about troublemaking in this lawless zone warranted caution. A single day’s stay justified the expense.

As Guan Yu continued inquiries, Wang Xiaorong posed the crucial question: “Countless challengers confront the Swordless Immortal—has none succeeded? Does no living soul know his true appearance?”

The attendant shook his head. “Legends say the Swordless Immortal embodies divine might—undefeatable. While fame-seekers abound, most gauge their capabilities first. Rash challengers—third-rate martial artists or desperate souls—ascend hoping for miraculous victory. Few return. Those who do either abandon their quest or linger to train, though such cases are rare.”

“Do survivors describe his features?” Guan Yu pressed.

“None have seen his face,” came the reply. “He wears a mask during combat. Most returnees never passed the manor’s retainers—the first trial before facing the Immortal himself. They say his techniques are lethally efficient, necessitated by endless challengers. Swift executions conserve his energy.”

Guan Yu found this troubling. Ruthless killing contradicted orthodox martial ethics. True mastery should enable victory without slaughter. Skill disparities, not brutality, determined bout durations. The Swordless Immortal’s bloodstained reign as undisputed champion seemed paradoxical for a supposed paragon.

Wang Xiaorong speculated, “Perhaps challengers glimpsed his hideous features beneath the mask, provoking lethal silences. His appearance must remain secret.”

**Chapter 4111: The Legend (Part 2)**

Guan Yu chuckled. “An amusing theory, yet plausible. Otherwise, the complete absence of survivors defies logic.”

The attendant added, “In earlier years, some challengers returned alive—though none saw his face. They described his movements and physique. But recently, fatalities increased. This paradoxically boosted our business—warriors prolong stays to prepare thoroughly before attempting the deadly ascent.”

Guan Yu pieced together the puzzle. Initially overwhelmed by challengers, the Swordless Immortal likely resorted to lethal measures to deter opportunists and protect his techniques from theft. Eliminating witnesses preserved his mysteries while thinning challenger numbers. Enhanced screening by skilled retainers now barred unworthy aspirants, granting the recluse greater peace.

This explained the deadly reputation. By slaughtering challengers, he maintained exclusivity over his methods and reduced nuisance confrontations. Recent years’ increased fatalities stemmed from strategic necessity rather than bloodlust.

After finalizing accommodations—twenty-one keys distributed among their party—Guan Yu proposed strategic room assignments. “Your Highness should occupy the central third-floor chamber with Wuhui and Wuxiao. Xiaorong and I will flank your left, Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi the right. This allows swift response to any incidents.”

The prince approved. “Well reasoned. First, stable the horses, then inspect our quarters.”

The Swordless Inn’s sprawling compound unfolded before them—crisscrossing stone paths flanked by manicured gardens, haphazard buildings housing focused guests. The eastern annex they’d rented stood apart from busier western sections near the communal dining pavilion.

Entering Building Twelve, they found surprisingly tidy quarters. The three-story structure featured symmetrical layouts—ground-floor common areas, identical upper chambers with superior materials on higher levels. Third-floor rooms boasted spacious interiors with panoramic views.

“Rest here while I inspect upstairs,” Guan Yu suggested. The prince’s central chamber offered dual beds. “How will three share two beds?” Guan Yu inquired.

Zou Wuhui answered, “We’ll alternate night watches.” Security superseded comfort for the prince’s guards.

Room assignments finalized, Guan Yu descended to organize provisions. Below, the inn’s labyrinthine expansion history manifested in its chaotic architecture—each new wing added eastward without planning, creating an easy-to-lose maze for newcomers.

As twilight deepened, guests hurried past bearing food boxes from the communal kitchen. The absence of room service contrasted with conventional inns, yet the system functioned efficiently. Their eastern building promised quiet, though its remoteness from main gates and dining areas required adjustment.

Surveying their temporary stronghold, Guan Yu marveled at renting an entire building—a testament to their resources. The well-maintained structure showed regular cleaning despite rustic surroundings. Symmetrical chambers and sturdy construction belied the inn’s piecemeal development.

**Chapter 4112: The Impact**

“Rest here while I arrange provisions,” Zou Wuhui told the prince. Guan Yu assisted with lodging logistics, ensuring all thirty-nine retainers received accommodations—triple occupancy where necessary.

The third-floor layout prioritized security. Zou Wangye’s central chamber provided visibility over the compound. Flanking rooms housed key personnel, while ground-floor quarters accommodated the bulk of their retinue. Though furnishings appeared worn, functionality sufficed for their brief stay.

As candles illuminated the building, Wang Xiaorong approved their lodgings. “Surprisingly clean for wilderness quarters.” Dust-free surfaces and aired bedding suggested diligent maintenance.

Guan Yu examined their defensive positioning. The building’s southern exposure allowed monitoring approaching threats. “We’ll rotate watches through the night,” he advised. “The prince’s safety precedes all else.”

Zou Wuxiao indicated their assigned structure. “Building Twelve—marked clearly.” The rented edifice symbolized both privilege and responsibility, housing their entire party under one roof.

Within hours, the inn’s peculiar rhythm became apparent—guests moved purposefully, avoiding interaction. The communal dining area’s stone tables hosted focused warriors fueling for their deadly ascent. This solemn atmosphere contrasted sharply with typical inns’ boisterousness.

As night deepened, Guan Yu contemplated tomorrow’s challenges. The Swordless Immortal’s legend loomed large—a mythic figure maintaining supremacy through calculated terror. Behind the mask and bloodshed lay strategic genius, preserving both mystery and martial dominance. Their journey’s next phase would test this legend’s mettle against modern challengers.
