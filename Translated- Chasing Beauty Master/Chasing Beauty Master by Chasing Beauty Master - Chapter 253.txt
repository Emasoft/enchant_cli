Mo Ling used Guan Yu as a pawn. If he truly were her man, Guan Yu would have no complaints – he’d dutifully drag Li Chen out for a beating without hesitation. But he wasn’t her man. Why should he act as Mo Ling’s convenient husband while enduring her so-called mother-in-law’s sarcastic jabs?

“Apologies, I’m busy. I’ll leave you to ponder alone.” Despite his composure, Guan Yu rose decisively and walked out without looking back.

Zhang Yi sat stunned in her chair, pondering Guan Yu’s blunt departure.

Hailing a taxi outside the teahouse, Guan Yu arrived at Mokai. The same security guard from yesterday now regarded him with fearful deference as he strode through the entrance. Employees’ gazes had transformed overnight – where yesterday held casual glances, today bore hushed whispers and awestruck stares.

“Good morning, Director Guan.” Cai Shuyu, the curvaceous secretary in a tight white blouse, bowed deeply enough to reveal cleavage. Guan Yu’s eyes lingered momentarily before accepting the files she offered.

In the executive elevator, Guan Yu rapidly digested documents about Mokai’s rival Hanhai. By the time they reached the top floor, he’d formulated plans. “The gala’s moved to tonight,” Xiao Xiong reminded as they stood before floor-to-ceiling windows. “Cheng Gui grows impatient.”

As evening fell, Guan Yu stood at the grand ballroom entrance surveying the crowd. His eyes locked onto the dance floor’s star couple – the woman whose familiar curves made his fingers twitch. When the music paused, she approached with swaying hips. “Care to dance?”

Their bodies merged into the waltz, Guan Yu’s hand drifting lower with each turn. Across the room, Mo Ling watched through narrowed eyes. “Filthy womanizer,” she hissed, unaware of her mother’s concerned gaze.

“Admit it – you’ve developed feelings,” Zhang Yi pressed as they observed the intimate dance.

“Never!” Mo Ling spat, though her clenched jaw betrayed more than anger. Memories of their staged bedroom scene flashed through her mind, fueling conflicted emotions. As Guan Yu’s palm settled possessively on his partner’s backside, Mo Ling blurted: “Yes, mother. We slept together.”
