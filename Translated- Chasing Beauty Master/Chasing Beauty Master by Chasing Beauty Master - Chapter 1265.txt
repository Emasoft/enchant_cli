“This injury of mine was treated by Master at great spiritual cost, all thanks to your ruthless methods, Guan Yu. I kindly escorted you back to Qianhui Peak, yet you stabbed me with a dagger—truly mistaking kindness for malice.”

The situation being delicate, Ling Su knew Guan Yu couldn’t be touched, especially with Shiqi present. Maintaining a gentlemanly demeanor was essential to leave a favorable impression.

“Indeed,” Guan Yu replied mockingly, glancing at Xiao Zhi to signal silence. “I can’t fathom why I found you so disagreeable that day. My strike was impulsive. Please forgive this junior brother, Senior Brother Ling Su. Who’d have thought Master would waste so much spiritual energy healing you?”

Ling Su’s face darkened. “Guan Yu, don’t think Master’s favor lets you run wild in the Cloud Azure Sect. Others fear you out of respect for Master—I don’t. Curb your arrogance, lest I teach you manners.”

Though aware of Guan Yu’s recent acquisition of a powerful artifact, Ling Su refused to lose face before Shiqi. Reputation outweighed all here.

Guan Yu chuckled. “If others fear me for Master’s sake, does your lack of fear disrespect him?”

“You—” Ling Su choked on his fury, unprepared for such shameless retorts.

“Me? What about me? Does your wrist still itch?” Guan Yu’s smile widened, recalling how he’d once pierced that wrist. Ling Su’s hand twitched phantom pain.

“My regard for Master is my affair!” Ling Su snapped. “I don’t fear you because you’re nothing to fear!”

**Chapter 3253: A Perfect Explanation**

“I know Senior Brother Ling Su fears neither heaven nor earth,” Guan Yu said coolly. “Having bullied most Cloud Azure disciples, you’re unaccustomed to defiance. But I’m different. Last time, your wrist. Tonight, I’ll pierce it again if provoked.”

Ling Su sneered. “You overestimate yourself! That ambush succeeded through luck. Don’t think two days of training make you formidable!”

As Xiao Zhi moved to speak, Aze restrained him with a headshake.

Guan Yu flourished a glinting dagger. “Shall we test that before everyone, Senior Brother?”

“Who dares cause trouble here?” A stern voice cut through as the crowd parted for Elder Xiang of Left Void Peak. His gaunt frame, silver hairpin, and sunken cheeks marked him instantly.

Surveying the injured A-Cai, Elder Xiang thundered, “Who did this? Explain!”

Wen Ming stepped forward. “Master, Guan Yu attacked when we confronted Xiao Zhi’s slander. He wounded A-Cai defending them.”

“Outrageous!” Elder Xiang glared at Guan Yu. With the Six Peaks Assembly tomorrow, losing a capable disciple enraged him. Left Void Peak already lacked strong contenders.

“Guan Yu,” he growled. “Give me a proper account!”

Approaching respectfully, Guan Yu began, “Elder Xiang, with so many witnesses here—”

Ling Su abruptly intercepted, bowing deeply. “Elder Xiang, as Guan Yu’s senior brother, I beg your leniency. His recklessness stems from Master’s indulgence.”

Guan Yu seethed inwardly. *The bastard plays the magnanimous senior while framing me!*

Elder Xiang nodded gravely. “Discipline falls to Sect Leader Xuanming. But such insolence—”

“Elder Xiang,” Guan Yu interjected, “A-Cai attacked first. I merely defended myself when his blade nearly split me.”

“Preposterous! Why would he strike unprovoked?”

“Perhaps he disliked the ‘meal’ I offered.” Guan Yu smirked. “When I spat, he lunged to ‘taste’ it. Found the flavor disagreeable, it seems.”

Retching sounds erupted as Shiqi’s group recoiled. A-Cai gagged violently.

Elder Xiang flushed. “Even so! Such provocation—”

“Provocation?” Guan Yu countered. “Who but a jawless fool catches spit midair? Or does Left Void Peak teach mouth-gaping as martial art?”

“Impudent!” Elder Xiang roared. “You dare insult your elder?”

“Respect is earned,” Guan Yu retorted. “Had your disciples not provoked, we wouldn’t waste time on petty squabbles. Should all peak elders meddle thus, the sect would crumble.”

Gasps filled the air. Xiao Zhi gaped—no disciple openly challenged elders!

Ling Su hid a smirk. *Fool! Now you’ve truly transgressed.*

“Guan Yu!” Elder Xiang trembled with rage. “Xuanming’s favor won’t shield your lawlessness! I’ll have you expelled for this disrespect!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Anger ages you, Elder. Do as you will.”

“Kneel and apologize!” Ling Su urged with feigned concern. “You’ve broken multiple sect rules!”

“Thank you for reminding him,” Guan Yu sneered. “Drop the act, Ling Su. Your ‘concern’ only seeks to weaponize Elder Xiang against me. Does Shiqi enjoy watching your theatrics?”

Ling Su stiffened. “I try saving you despite your crimes! This defiance—”

“What crimes?” Guan Yu spread his hands. “I never swore to obey arbitrary rules. Master exempted me from such trifles. Unlike you lapdogs, I serve the sect through deeds, not groveling.”

**Chapter 3254: Recklessness**

Elder Xiang saw his opening. “Xuanming spoils you rotten! This proves sect rules must bind even his favorites!”

“Bind this.” Guan Yu tapped his dagger. “I’ll leave before obeying fools. But remember—I depart only when *I* choose.”

The standoff crackled until distant bells signaled curfew. Elder Xiang glared poison but retreated. “This isn’t over!”

As crowds dispersed, Ling Su whispered to Shiqi, “See his true nature?”

She frowned. “I see two quarreling roosters. Neither impressed me tonight.”

**Chapter 3255: My Justification (Part 1)**

Alone later, Guan Yu chuckled at the moon. *Let them scheme. When the Assembly comes...* His blade gleamed like a predator’s smile.
