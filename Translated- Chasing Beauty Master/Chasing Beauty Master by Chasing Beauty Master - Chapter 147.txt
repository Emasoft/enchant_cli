The old man sitting on the second bunk near the door shrank his neck, eyes filled with terror. Damn... He'd finally managed to please Da Long, but now with a new cell leader, his days of suffering were about to begin again!

Rapists were the most despised in prison. Whenever transferred to a new cell, they'd get brutally beaten—especially scum like this old pervert who'd assaulted underage girls.

Trembling, the old man approached Guan Yu, bowing obsequiously. "Big Brother... it's me!"

"You? Proud of yourself?" Guan Yu smirked, leaning casually against the bed frame.

"No, no! I was drunk! The case files aren't accurate—"

"Tell me the details." Guan Yu crossed his arms, settling comfortably against the iron bed.

Chapter 361: Teaching Him a Lesson

Guan Yu couldn't care less about the pervert's crimes. As the old man stammered through his story, prisoners craned their necks curiously. Strangely, instead of anger, Guan Yu listened with apparent amusement.

"So you enjoyed it? Found little girls special?" Guan Yu mocked.

Emboldened by the lack of punishment, the pervert leered, "Better than those thick-ankled hags. That girl definitely—"

Mid-sentence, Guan Yu's boot smashed into his gut. "Fuck you! Still grinning? Shameless bastard!" The sudden kick sent the man flying across the cell.

Xiao Xiong caught the crumpled figure mid-air. Silent until now, the chained man suddenly slapped the pervert before punching him back toward Guan Yu.

"Take him aside and loosen his skin," Guan Yu ordered dismissively.

Eager prisoners dragged the wretch to the toilet corner, raining blows until guard's baton clanged against steel doors. "Da Long! Stop causing trouble!"

The guard paused, noticing Guan Yu occupying the prime eastern bunk. "New leader? Keep it quiet." The door slammed shut.

As footsteps faded, the beating resumed. "Scream again, motherfucker!"

Cowering by the urinal, the pervert wept silently. How many beatings was this?

"Join me?" Guan Yu patted his bunk, inviting Xiao Xiong.

The chained man shook his head. "Passing through."

Da Long whispered, "That's Xiao Xiong—mogul of Mo Kai Group. Took over L City's underworld in six months before getting framed."

Guan Yu nodded. Truly a den of dragons. Though radiating authority, Xiao Xiong showed no hostility. Understanding transient alliances, Guan Yu offered, "Sleep here then," gesturing to Da Long's former spot.

The eastern bunk's luxury—layered mattresses—contrasted starkly with others' thin bedding. As calm returned, the pervert crawled forward, missing a slipper in the toilet.

"Clean the latrines from now on."

"Yes! Yes!" The man's wrinkled eyes brimmed with fear.

Chapter 362: To Each Their Fate

When Guan Yu shared his special meal—white buns and stir-fried pork—Da Long's gratitude became evident. Xiao Xiong joined them, exchanging his chicken leg for cornbread only to spit it out. "Damn rocks!"

Laughter dissolved tensions. The trio's dynamic solidified—Guan Yu as leader, Da Long as second, Xiao Xiong the neutral force.

Next cell over, crashes signaled Niu Le's rebellion. Guan Yu chuckled—his hotheaded friend would rather die than submit. Though outnumbered, the roars continued intermittently.

At mealtime, guards delivered special rations—steamed buns for Guan Yu, chicken and eggs for Xiao Xiong. "Reformed already?" the guard joked, noting the new hierarchy.

Watching Xiao Xiong's premium meal, Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. "Connections?"

"Expensive favors. Short-lived comfort." Xiao Xiong's smile turned bitter.

Chapter 363: Boundless Energy

When Guan Yu shared his food, Da Long's eyes moistened. Xiao Xiong swapped eggs for cornbread, gagging dramatically. "Tastes like gravel!"

Their laughter echoed through the cell. Men's bonds formed simply here—through shared hardship and fleeting camaraderie.

As Niu Le's battle cries resumed next door, Guan Yu lay back comfortably. Prison life wasn't so bad... for those with strength to claim their place.
