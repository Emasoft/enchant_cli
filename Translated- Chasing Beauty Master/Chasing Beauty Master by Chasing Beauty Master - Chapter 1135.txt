“Men of status within their households, though capable of infidelity, are less likely to do so. Such men are wealthy and hold high positions at home. Over time, they grow disinterested in their wives and seek younger, prettier women outside. Yet such affairs rarely disrupt their families, for these men only lavish money on their mistresses, never emotional attachment.

As for men like Liang Yuefa (Reading Ambition), their career prospects force them to invest emotions where they’d rather not. Thus, they abandon wives and children to court Xiaojuan wholeheartedly, all for their own futures. They see no alternative.

Qi Zhi, drenched in sweat, struggled to restrain Erjuan. Mediating between women was treacherous—their delicate sensibilities left few safe points to grasp. He could only clutch her shoulders to prevent further violence.

Jinhua turned to Guanyu, disgusted. “That man’s utter trash, no wonder his wife curses him! Look how he fawns over that mistress—wagging his tail like a puppy. Scum like him should die and make room for decent folk.”

Guanyu countered, “That’s unfair. He’s acting in self-interest. Are we to brand everyone selfish as beasts? All humans are self-serving. His actions follow reason.”

“Hmph! Of course you’d defend your own gender,” Jinhua muttered. “All men are rotten. That wretch is despicable, yet you justify him.”

Guanyu shook his head helplessly, knowing further debate futile. Silence spared him Jinhua’s retorts.

Noting his quiet, Jinhua softened. “Though not all men are beasts. The mediator seems decent—genuinely trying to calm that angry woman. Far better than cheating trash who flaunt their excuses.”

“He appears adequate. Best we don’t interfere—just observe,” Guanyu cautioned, wary of Qi Zhi recognizing him. He lingered to test whether Jin’s phone disguise worked.

Even Pan Taisheng hadn’t identified him; Qi Zhi likely wouldn’t either.

Guanyu puzzled over Qi Zhi residing in Pan’s apartment. Coincidence? Or was he plotting something there? This required urgent investigation.

Commotion erupted outside as police pushed through the crowd. The arriving squad barked, “Quiet! Everyone quiet! What happened here? Who started this?”

Erjuan immediately subdued herself. An officer scanned the scene. “Who’s the assailant?”

Relieved, Qi Zhi grinned. “Officers, I was just mediating. Since you’re here, I’ll take my leave. They’ll explain.”

“Halt!” An officer stopped him. “You stay until we’ve gathered statements.”

With Erjuan sobbing uncontrollably and Xiaojuan disheveled in Liang’s arms, the police deduced the situation.

“Domestic dispute? You cheated?” an officer bluntly asked Liang, who nodded meekly.

The officer scoffed—another mistress confrontation, daily fare. “Take them all to the station. Clear out, everyone! You there—stop filming! Vultures!”

As the crowd dispersed, Jinhua tugged Guanyu away. “Will the short-haired woman get jailed?”

“Depends on the mistress’s charges. If she insists on prosecution, yes—though not for long given her injuries.”

“But she needed support walking! So much blood—maybe broken bones!”

“Only medical exams will tell. The child’s fate...” Guanyu trailed off.

Jinhua fretted. “That scum won’t care for the daughter!”

“If the mistress accepts compensation instead of pressing charges, jail might be avoided.” Guanyu doubted it—the well-off mistress seemed intent on vengeance. The child’s plight wasn’t his concern.

“We’re mere spectators,” he said. “Tonight’s priority is you attending to me properly.” Jinhua smiled, anticipating their long-awaited rendezvous.

Next morning, after briefing Jinhua, Guanyu headed not to Qiao District but the leather factory. Wang Hu reported Sun Xu attempting to retrieve items—now detained awaiting Guanyu.

Wary of traps, Guanyu summoned Xue Jing. Waiting at Pan’s apartment, he encountered Pan himself.

“Brother Pan, thank you for hosting my friend.”

“No formalities between brothers!” Pan chuckled. “That girl you placed in Kaihuang High—Qu Shuangshuang—tops every exam! The school’s beloved beauty queen too.”

Guanyu raised eyebrows. “She’s excelling? I should visit with gifts.”

Pan led him to the restructured security room. “We upgraded surveillance. This space was meant for Old Sun—better than his basement cot. But before we moved him...”

“His attacker paid the hospital deposit,” Pan reported, returning Guanyu’s unused bank card. “The城管 (urban management officer) coughed up 200,000—apologizing profusely. Your doing?”

Guanyu nodded. “Such scum shouldn’t serve.”

Discussing Qi Zhi’s background, Pan said, “Southern roots, but naturalized. Chose our apartments for work prospects. Seems harmless.”

Guanyu frowned. “He claimed foreign nationality at the club.”

“Overseas birth, raised here. Naturalized years back.”

Xue Jing’s arrival interrupted them. “Where’s ‘Brother Jinci’?” she challenged.

Guanyu deflected as they departed, reminding Pan to monitor Qi Zhi discreetly. The puzzle remained—harmless tenant or hidden threat?
