However, this turn of events brought an opportunity. As long as Xiao Xiong remained in his position, Guan Yu's role as the mastermind would remain obscured. Thus, Guan Yu tacitly agreed to this arrangement.

What he didn't know was that Xiao Xiong had made this decision with genuine sincerity.

Guan Yu chuckled, "Brother Xiao's plan seems solid. Let's proceed as suggested."

Xiao Xiong nodded in satisfaction. Through this incident, he had gained insight into Guan Yu's character. Strangely, he felt the Dragon Tiger Hall would flourish under Guan Yu's leadership—a conviction he couldn't fully explain.

At that moment, the private dining room door opened as servers arrived with their dishes. Guan Yu rolled his eyes at the lavish spread and said to the manager, "There's only two of us. This is too much—such waste is unnecessary even for the wealthy."

The manager glanced meaningfully at Guan Yu but remained silent. These orders came directly from their "Big Sister," leaving him no room for objection.

Suddenly, a voice echoed from outside:

"Who said there's only two? Aren't we here too?"

Feng Xin strode in wearing sleek professional attire, accompanied by three elderly men—the retired triumvirate of N City's underworld: the patriarchs of the Feng, Xu, and Lin families.

Old Master Feng smiled warmly. "Guan Yu, you didn't even visit after being released! We had to seek you out ourselves."

Old Master Xu interjected teasingly, "Don't mind him. We happened to be dining here and thought we'd join your feast."

Guan Yu bowed slightly. "My apologies, elders. Recent affairs kept me occupied. I'll pay proper visits once matters settle, if you'll still welcome me."

Feng Xin snorted. "Too busy chasing butterflies and bees, more like."

Guan Yu awkwardly smiled. This woman still held a grudge over the morning's incident.

Old Master Lin mediated, "Who could refuse you? Old Feng here hit the jackpot with such an outstanding grandson-in-law. If only I had a granddaughter..."

Old Master Feng puffed with pride. "Of course—my granddaughter's match is exceptional. Now sit, Guan Yu. You don't mind dining with old relics, do you?"

Feng Xin's cheeks flushed pink.

"Not at all! It's an honor," Guan Yu insisted, ushering the elders to their seats. They then noticed Xiao Xiong's composed presence. Guan Yu introduced, "Esteemed elders, may I present my sworn brother, Xiao Xiong."

After reciprocal introductions, Xiao Xiong rose politely. "Xiao Xiong greets the honorable elders and... sister-in-law."

Having overheard earlier exchanges, he easily deduced Feng Xin's relationship to Guan Yu.

Feng Xin studied Xiao Xiong, flushing at the address. "Who's his girlfriend? Let him go find his precious Teacher Mo Ling!"

Guan Yu sighed helplessly; when a woman held a grudge, it was truly terrifying.

"You're Xiao Xiong?" Feng Xin pressed.

He nodded.

"Xiao Xiong, leader of L City's Dragon Tiger Hall?"

Another nod.

Feng Xin gasped, staring in shock.

**Chapter 396: Old Grudges, New Enmities**

Her reaction drew the elders' attention. Old Master Feng scrutinized Xiao Xiong—any man who could startle his granddaughter warranted notice.

"Feng Xin, you know Guan Yu's friend?"

She composed herself. "A legend in L City's underworld. At 25, he unified the entire city's factions within six months as Dragon Tiger Hall's leader. His name resounds throughout the circuit."

The three patriarchs gaped, understanding the monumental feat of controlling a provincial capital's underworld—a task they themselves had never achieved despite decades of rivalry.

Xiao Xiong remained humble. "You exaggerate, sister-in-law."

Feng Xin glared. "Who's your sister-in-law? I'm older than you!"

"Then... elder sister?"

"Elder sister? Guan Yu's younger than you!"

Both men stared in confusion at her contradictory stance.

Guan Yu marveled at the underworld legend's social awkwardness, suspecting past romantic trauma.

Noticing her self-contradiction, Feng Xin stomped Guan Yu's foot under the table. He winced—her tantrums knew no logic.

Old Master Feng praised, "Youth prevails where age falters. The river of talent never ceases flowing."

Xiao Xiong's curious glance prompted the elder's explanation: "Have you heard of N City's Four Eccentrics? We three are the survivors."

Melancholy flickered in Old Master Feng's eyes.

Old Master Xu murmured, "Each path is self-chosen. Old Xu's fate was his own making."

Xiao Xiong's mind reeled. The Four Eccentrics' legends still circulated—their successors' decline had faded their legacy, yet here sat the living legends, closely allied with Guan Yu.

Feng Xin interrogated Guan Yu: "How did you meet him?"

"Detention center."

"Detention?" Her brow furrowed—why would a crime lord be there?

Xiao Xiong explained his framed predicament. Feng Xin shot him a peculiar look—nearly undone by a woman's scheme.

As camaraderie grew, the atmosphere warmed—except Feng Xin's cold shoulder toward Guan Yu.

Mid-celebration, arguing voices erupted outside. Old Master Feng frowned. "Feng Xin, investigate."

Before she could move, the door crashed open. Five men barged in.

Guan Yu's gaze sharpened upon recognizing the leader. "Park Xu. Brave of you to remain in N City. Let's settle old scores."

**Chapter 397: Pride Before Fall**

Park Xu froze, spotting Guan Yu. "You?!"

Shock colored his features. Having engineered Guan Yu's incarceration, he'd assumed victory certain—yet here stood his nemesis, usurping his reserved room. The humiliation burned.

Guan Yu smirked. "Surprised? Did you think your petty schemes could cage me?"

Park Xu sneered. "If I sent you in once, I'll do it again."

He dismissed Guan Yu's escape as luck, unaware of the younger man's capabilities.

"Then I'll collect interest first," Guan Yu declared, eyes glinting.

Park Xu's bodyguards—ex-special forces elites—stepped forward instinctively.

Guan Yu assessed them warily, sensing threat.

Park Xu taunted, "Dare try?"

In a blur, Guan Yu activated his gravity-dampening system, launching like a missile. The guards reacted swiftly—a knee to ribs, elbow to back—but Guan Yu absorbed the blows, grabbing Park Xu's shoulders.

A brutal knee to the gut doubled Park Xu over before a kick sent him flying through the doorway.

Guan Yu rubbed his sore side. "Good hit. But worth it."

Turning cheerfully, he announced, "Problem solved! Let's eat."

The table sat stunned.

Xiao Xiong admired the ruthless efficiency—his own style mirrored.

Feng Xin scolded, "Reckless fool! Charging armed guards!"

Guan Yu feigned contrition as Old Master Feng defended him: "Boldness wins battles! Boy, drink with me!"

Guan Yu gratefully downed the toast.

Feng Xin muttered, "Traitorous grandfather—he's not even your in-law yet!"

Guan Yu nearly choked. Her mood swings baffled him.

"So he framed you?" Feng Xin pressed.

Guan Yu nodded.

"Why?"

"Old feud."

Her eyes narrowed. "A romantic feud, perhaps?"

Guan Yu buried his face in his bowl. Women's intuition was terrifying.
