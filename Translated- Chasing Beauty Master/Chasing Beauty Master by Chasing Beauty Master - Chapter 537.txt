“Damn it, this is just too unlucky! All I wanted was to find some treasure, but nearly lost my life. Looks like I can’t return to that place anymore—at least not for a while. If that guy catches me there again, who knows if he’ll kill me? With my current Fifth Level of Body Refinement strength, I probably couldn’t withstand half a move from him. Better wait until I’m stronger,” Guan Yu muttered helplessly.

***

“Young Master Guan Yu, you’re back! Elder Allen and I were worried sick! If you hadn’t returned soon, I was about to go search for you with the Young Priestess!” The speaker was Luo Xi, who immediately rushed toward the approaching figure.

***

“I told Elder Allen not to worry. I’m not a child anymore. I was just chasing an injured man,” Guan Yu said, watching Luo Xi’s hurried approach with resignation.

***

“That’s exactly what I told Luo Xi, but she insisted on coming to find you,” a voice interjected.

***

“Well, I’m here now. Let’s go inform Elder Allen together.”

***

“Alright.” Luo Xi promptly grabbed Guan Yu’s hand and pulled him toward Elder Allen’s dwelling.

***

“Elder Allen! Young Master Guan Yu has returned!” Luo Xi called out as they approached the wooden structure.

***

As Guan Yu reached the doorway, a figure swiftly emerged from within.

***

“Little Brother Guan Yu! Thank the heavens you’re safe! Quick—come see what’s wrong with Amy!”

***

“Did you receive the antidote I sent back with someone?”

***

Elder Allen nodded. “She’s improved greatly. I gave her an elixir before your return. The poison’s discoloration has faded, and she’s resting now.”

***

“That’s a relief. Elder Allen, there’s something I must apologize for—”

***

The elder raised a hand. “No need. I already know. This wasn’t your fault—you acted to ensure Amy’s safety. Upon reflection, there was no need to pursue a defeated foe. By the way, Jinx mentioned you continued chasing into the forest. Was there danger?”

***

Guan Yu hesitated, knowing full well he hadn’t pursued Locke at all, but instead ventured into a rare marshland where he’d encountered an unimaginably powerful expert.

***

“Little Brother Guan Yu! Did you let that bastard Locke escape?” Shituo’s booming voice sounded as the bear-like warrior approached.

***

Greeting the newcomer, Guan Yu explained, “He fled after forced demonic transformation. When the effects fade, his cultivation will be severely weakened—no threat to the elves now.”

***

The group relaxed at this news until a guard hurried in. “Elder! Scouts report numerous humans gathering near our borders!”

***

Elder Allen stood abruptly. “Humans? Are they targeting the Sylvan Woods?”

***

“Unclear, but they’re prowling the outskirts as if searching for something.”

***

Guan Yu’s thoughts immediately flew to the glowing marshland—perhaps others had detected its crimson light and come treasure hunting.

***

“I knew sparing that scoundrel was a mistake!” Shituo growled. “After all Locke’s treachery with humans, this must be his doing!”

***

“Peace, Brother Shituo,” Elder Allen cautioned. “We’ll investigate first. Everyone prepare for possible conflict, but hope for benign intent.”

***

“What’s to investigate? Clearly Locke’s—” Shituo began, but fell silent under the elder’s stern look.

***

Guan Yu interjected, “Let me scout ahead. If they’re hostile, my presence as a human might defuse tensions.”

***

Secretly, he hoped to safeguard knowledge of the treasure. Though currently beyond his reach, he vowed to claim it once stronger.

***

“Very well,” Elder Allen agreed after consideration.

***

As Guan Yu concealed his excitement, another voice called outside: “Elder Allen! The humans seek no conflict—they’re hunting a treasure!”

***

“Treasure?” The elder nodded. “As I suspected from the crimson light. Were Amy recovered, I’d investigate myself.”

***

Resigned to shared discovery, Guan Yu offered, “Shall I still go? Better our people find it than outsiders.”

***

“Young friend, know this—where great treasures lie, greater guardians await. The rarer the prize, the deadlier its protectors.”

***

Guan Yu nodded, recalling similar warnings from Bicat.

***

[Chapter 1360: Nightshade Forest]

***

“The crimson glow suggests a century-grade treasure,” Elder Allen continued. “Its origin points to Nightshade Forest.”

***

“Nightshade Forest?”

***

“Our realm divides into four regions: Sylvan Woods, Deathgrip Vale, Nightshade Forest, and common woods. While Deathgrip teems with beasts, Nightshade’s fewer creatures are... unnatural.”

***

“But Deathgrip didn’t seem dangerous when I visited,” Guan Yu muttered.

***

Shituo cuffed him playfully. “Sneaking into Deathgrip, eh? Normally manageable, but treasure draws high-tier beasts! Remember—eighth-tier monsters rival human Sword Kings!”

***

“I’ll stay in Nightshade’s outskirts. At Fifth Level Body Refinement, I’d die instantly confronting such beasts. Not keen to meet the King of Hell yet!” Guan Yu grinned.

***

“Enough cheek! Return promptly next time,” Shituo chided. “Treasures aren’t easily claimed.”

***

“Understood.” Guan Yu turned to Elder Allen, whose stern visage couldn’t conceal paternal pride.

***

As Guan Yu prepared to leave, Luo Xi spoke up: “Uncle Allen, let me accompany him!”

***

The elder frowned. “Too dangerous. Can this reckless lad protect you?”

***

Shituo nudged him, whispering, “Can’t you see the girl’s sweet on him?”

***

Elder Allen’s eyes widened in realization before sighing, “That rascal certainly charms the ladies.”

***

“Let them gain experience,” Shituo urged. “They’ll grow through adversity.”

***

“Exactly! Uncle Allen, I’m grown now. Even Shituo agrees!” Luo Xi pressed, flashing Guan Yu a shy smile.

***

“Very well. But avoid Nightshade’s depths!” the elder relented.

***

Both youths nodded, surprised by the concession.

***

“Prepare thoroughly. Depart tomorrow—this won’t be a brief excursion. Safety first!”

***

***

Returning to his quarters, Guan Yu marveled at escaping reprimand. Retrieving a crimson fruit from his robes—a Marshfire Berry found in Nightshade’s wetlands—he sighed. Though brimming with yang energy to boost Qi Condensation realms, it remained useless until he advanced past Body Refinement’s seventh level.

***

In Bluemist Continent, true cultivation began only at Sword King realm—seven Body Refinements, three Qi Condensations, and successful Core Formation. Beyond lay Warrior, Master, Emperor ranks in martial arts; Brawler, Champion, Sovereign in combat arts; followed by human realms of King, Sage, and Monarch. The legendary Divine Emperor realm—unseen since ancient times—promised dominion over heaven and earth.

***

“Must train harder,” Guan Yu resolved, eyeing the berry. Though currently a Body Refinement cultivator dabbling in magic, he aspired to dual mastery. After sensing impending breakthrough, he meditated through the night.

***

[Chapter 1361: Vanishing Wetlands]

***

At dawn, Guan Yu slipped out unseen, drawn back to Nightshade Forest. “That marsh held a Marshfire Berry—must be more treasures! Yesterday’s rush made me miss—” His thoughts halted as the wetlands had disappeared without trace.

***

As he turned back, a familiar voice sneered: “Fancy meeting you here! Healed from last time? I’ve been awaiting our rematch!”

***

Before Guan Yu stood Murong Yu—young master of Jinzhou’s Murong Clan. Though merely an initial-stage Great Swordsman, his dozen retainers paled before the white-haired elder beside him—a presence radiating Sword King-level aura at minimum.

***

Guan Yu’s mind raced. The Murongs’ strongest was Sword King Murong Hai, but this elder’s age disproved that. Survival, not victory, dominated his thoughts now.
