“Second to Wolf stepped forward and said, ‘The Four Great Venoms. I never expected you gentlemen to come today. How curious. I wonder which formidable adversary bears me such enmity to have hired your services. Truly a grand gesture.’

‘How fortunate you’re so perceptive,’ said Second Brother, pointing his wooden staff at Second to Wolf with a giggle. His voice carried an eerie androgyny that grated on the ears. ‘Since you already know who we are, why not save us the trouble and end yourself?’

‘Ridiculous!’ Second to Wolf growled fiercely. ‘Even if I die today, I’ll strip the flesh from your bones before falling. You’ll pay dearly for this.’

‘That depends on whether you possess such capability,’ Second Brother tittered again, clearly the most talkative among the four.

Guanyu stepped forward with a smile. ‘Who exactly is your target? Him alone, or both of us?’

‘Our mark is Second to Wolf,’ Second Brother replied, ‘but since you’re here, I wouldn’t mind collecting specimen materials for Elder Brother and Fourth Brother.’ His recurring giggle after each sentence made Guanyu’s skin crawl.

Guanyu remarked, ‘There are four of you, yet only this motherfucker can speak? His voice alone makes me retch. Are the others mute? Can someone else converse with this young master? I can’t endure his repulsive noises any longer.’

Second to Wolf stared blankly at Guanyu’s outburst. While he’d been strategizing against their foes, his companion chose this critical moment for jests. Yet he couldn’t deny Second Brother’s voice—neither properly male nor female—was indeed revolting.

Perhaps unaccustomed to such brazen insults, or because previous mockers lay dead, the Four Venoms appeared momentarily stunned.

‘Brat,’ growled Elder Brother, breaking the silence, ‘your audacity insults the Four Great Venoms. Since you court death, consider yourself fortunate—today you’ll become ingredients for my poisoncraft.’

**Chapter 2414: Setting Fire**

Guanyu chuckled. ‘Come then, if you dare. But don’t underestimate me.’ As he spoke, the Four Venoms surged forward, occupying the four cardinal directions to encircle their prey.

Guanyu’s keen spatial awareness recognized their formation—an ancient Chinese tactic using directional alignment to create a quaternary Bagua array. When four practitioners moved in psychic synchrony across compass points, the surrounded victim would instinctively position themselves at the center’s vulnerable nexus.

The Venoms’ interconnected qi formed an impregnable network—attacking one would trigger coordinated counterstrikes from three directions. Their illusory footwork (‘Four Directions Transforming to Eight Trigrams’) rendered conventional assaults futile, as targets dematerialized before blows landed.

Second to Wolf tested this by striking at Fourth Brother, only to watch his attack pass through empty air as the figure shimmered and reappeared elsewhere.

‘Illusions—smoke and mirrors!’ Guanyu realized. Activating his protective shield—a nimbus of milky white streaked with pale gold—he shouted, ‘Blind fire!’

Both men drew pistols, spraying bullets indiscriminately. The Venoms’ seamless dance faltered under this unorthodox assault. Fourth Brother yelped as a grazing shot tore his sleeve—their first blood drawn.

‘Stay calm!’ Third Brother urged. ‘Their ammunition dwindles!’

As predicted, the barrage ceased. Second Brother giggled anew: ‘No more bullets? Now witness your doom!’

‘Must you keep speaking?’ Second to Wolf spat. ‘Rot in silence!’

Guanyu noted reforming energy barriers. ‘They’ll seal the area again for poison gas. Quick—fire breeds heat kills toxin!’ He stripped his jacket, igniting it with a lighter. The flames’ convection purged the miasma.

**Chapter 2415: Clash of Titans (Part 1)**

Guanyu holstered his last two rounds while Second to Wolf emptied his magazine. The Venoms regrouped, but fresh air now diluted their poison.

‘Giggle all you want,’ Guanyu taunted as spatial pressure rebuilt. ‘Your parlor tricks won’t—’

Third Brother materialized, his massive dao sword crashing against the shield. Though the blade rebounded harmlessly, its spiritual shockwave churned Guanyu’s qi. A metal card then embedded in his barrier, spinning like a drill bit.

‘Persistent pests!’ Guanyu grunted as Second Brother’s staff struck the same shield point. While parrying these staggered attacks, he noticed Second to Wolf probing the perimeter—equally frustrated.

‘They’re phantoms!’ Guanyu realized. Closing his eyes, he refined his shield to pure white. When the spinning card intensified, he drew his pistol and fired two blind shots leftward.

The metallic clang confirmed his guess—Fourth Brother abandoned his weapon. Though unharmed, the Venoms’ rhythm broke.

**Chapter 2416: Clash of Titans (Part 2)**

Guanyu’s enhanced shield withstood renewed assaults. Third Brother’s spiritual strikes now caused dizziness—a dangerous attrition.

‘They’ll grind me down!’ Guanyu realized. Feigning vulnerability, he took a dao slash head-on while channeling energy. As Third Brother overextended, Guanyu’s fist shot through the illusion—but struck nothing.

The true danger emerged elsewhere—Elder Brother’s poison fog thickened anew. Second to Wolf shouted warnings as visibility vanished.

‘No wind... barrier reformed.’ Guanyu’s mind raced. ‘Then burn hotter!’ He ignited his remaining clothes, creating an inferno that warped the Venoms’ illusions.

In the chaos, Second to Wolf lunged at a shimmering outline—his blade found flesh. Fourth Brother screamed, the formation faltering.

‘Now!’ Guanyu roared. His final bullets tore through weakening barriers as the combatants collided in the scorching haze—true battle joined at last.
