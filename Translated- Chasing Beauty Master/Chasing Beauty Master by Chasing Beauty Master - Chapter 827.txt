The proprietress couldn’t care less about their words—all she wanted was compensation from Guan Yu. After surveying the shattered glass door, broken table, and scattered plates, she sighed mournfully and declared, “The damages amount to roughly ten thousand yuan. I won’t extort you—just pay me ten thousand, and we’re settled.”

“Ten thousand? Why not just rob us outright?” Qing Ling’er erupted upon hearing the sum. To her, ten thousand yuan was no trivial amount.

Guan Yu raised a hand to halt her outburst and remarked coolly, “Ten thousand is nothing. Consider it a generous tip for the proprietress’s… unique hospitality. Now we know better than to return to this ‘Xiaodan Restaurant.’ No need to fuss over such petty cash—it’s hardly worth the rage.”

As he approached the proprietress, he paused, struck by her flawless complexion. Even at close range, her skin rivaled Zhang Han’s—porcelain-smooth, devoid of pores, as if painted onto parchment.

Most women would blush under Guan Yu’s gaze, given his striking looks. Yet the proprietress met his stare head-on, thrusting her chest forward defiantly. “What do you want?” she challenged.

“Such fiery temperament,” Guan Yu mused before replying, “I merely lack cash. Do you accept card payments?”

“Of course.” She retrieved a portable card reader from the counter—a common sight in restaurants frequented by card-carrying patrons.

Without another word, Guan Yu paid the ten thousand yuan, then gestured for Qing Ling’er and Pan Taisheng to leave. The crowd dispersed slowly—some sympathizing with Guan Yu, knowing the proprietress had bitten her benefactor like the proverbial dog snapping at Lü Dongbin*; others secretly admired the proprietress, their hearts aflame with infatuation.

After exiting Xiaodan Restaurant and bidding Pan Taisheng farewell, Guan Yu intended to visit Qing Ling’er’s apartment. But trouble arose before they could ascend the stairs.

Night had fallen, and Guan Yu’s car stood parked across the street. A crowd now surrounded it. Initially assuming parking issues, Guan Yu soon spotted a familiar purple Porsche—one he’d seen at the Feng residence. Retreating slowly, he realized Feng Xihu must be inside.

“That woman’s relentless,” he muttered. Crossing the road now was impossible—they’d have to circle back discreetly.

But with only one entrance to Pan Taisheng’s apartment complex and his car parked nearby, detection seemed inevitable. Feng’s subordinates, many of whom might recognize Guan Yu from his prior infiltration of their compound, were already approaching.

Clutching Qing Ling’er’s hand, Guan Yu froze at the restaurant entrance, observing the scene across the street.

“Big Brother Guan,” Qing Ling’er asked, “why are those people surrounding your Dahang?”

Guan Yu hesitated. “Ah… perhaps they admire the model. Just curious onlookers.”

Too sharp to be fooled, Qing Ling’er pressed, “They look purposeful—like they’re targeting your car! Are they thieves? Or is it blocking something? But the road’s wide enough…”

Ignoring her questions, Guan Yu suggested, “It’s still early—let’s take a stroll.”

“What about your car?”

“Don’t worry—they wouldn’t dare steal it.”

He led her westward along the storefronts, hastening to avoid detection. Fifty meters later, a voice rang out: “Hey! Guan Yu! Don’t you dare run!”

Guan Yu froze—the proprietress’s shout had alerted Feng’s men. Peering across the street, he saw them advancing. “Damn it—she’s a jinx!” he cursed. As Feng Xihu emerged from her car, Guan Yu scooped Qing Ling’er into a princess carry and bolted.

Qing Ling’er’s magic-strap canvas shoes tapped rhythmically against the pavement until Guan Yu’s speed outpaced her. Cradled against his chest, she initially gasped in surprise but soon found comfort in his secure embrace, undisturbed by the jostling despite his rapid pace.

“Faster!” Feng Xihu’s shrill command pierced the air. “If he escapes, I’ll skin you alive!”

The proprietress’s voice followed: “Wait! I miscalculated—you owe another five thousand for emotional distress!”

“Screw that!” Guan Yu muttered, weaving through evening strollers. The spectacle of a man fleeing with a beauty while black-suited pursuers gave chase drew mixed reactions—some parted ways instinctively at his shouts of “Make way!”; others gawked.

Darting into an alley shortcut, Guan Yu nearly collided with a couple mid-coitus against a wall. “Sorry!” he barked as Qing Ling’er buried her face in his shoulder, squeaking “Shameless!”

“Ruined their moment,” Guan Yu thought ruefully, knowing Feng’s men would soon disrupt them further. Once reaching a less crowded street, he channeled inner energy into his legs, swiftly outdistancing his pursuers.

Back at Xiaodan Restaurant, the proprietress pouted in disappointment. “Almost scammed another five thousand from that fool,” she grumbled, sweeping greasy debris. “Pity my shout scared him off.” The avaricious woman had already tripled her actual damages through Guan Yu’s initial payment.

Across the street, Feng Xihu glared at the retreating figures before turning her attention to the restaurant. “Wait here,” she ordered her subordinates, striding toward the shattered entrance.

Inside, the proprietress—clad in a blush-pink kimono and frilly white apron, cheeks flushed and hair disheveled from cleaning—looked up as Feng entered. “We’re closed,” she said wearily.

“I’m not here to eat.” Feng’s gaze swept over the other woman’s striking beauty, a pang of jealousy tightening her chest. “You know Guan Yu. What’s your relationship?”

The proprietress’s eyes narrowed. “Guan Yu? Never heard of him.”

“Don’t lie. I heard you shouting about emotional damages.” Feng tossed a wad of bills onto a table. “Five thousand—now talk.”

Snatching the money, the proprietress smirked. “He owed me five thousand. That’s all.”

Feng leaned closer. “And you are to him?”

“Just a creditor.” The proprietress’s gaze hardened. “Who are *you* to him?”

“I,” Feng declared, chin lifted, “am becoming his woman. No one—not even a hundred existing lovers—will stop that.”
