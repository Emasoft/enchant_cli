“I originally intended to have us depart today, but given your condition, it seems we must delay our journey. I suggest you rest here for another day. We’ll reassess tomorrow before setting out,” Guan Yu said.

Yan Zhao agreed wholeheartedly. His body felt utterly drained, making travel impossible—at least for today. “Thank goodness! I was thinking the same. I’ve no strength left. Journeying now is out of the question.”

Guan Yu paid Yan Zhao no further mind and strode out of the room. Wang Xiaorong followed and proposed, “Guan Yu, since we’re staying another day, why not explore the town while we have time?”

“Splendid idea. Let’s treat it as a holiday,” Guan Yu replied with a chuckle.

“Holiday? What’s a ‘holiday’? Is it a place nearby? Let’s hurry and see if it’s fun!”

Guan Yu sighed inwardly, realizing the term held no meaning here. “A ‘holiday’ simply means leisurely going wherever you please for enjoyment,” he explained.

After storing their belongings, the pair informed the innkeeper they would extend their stay. “We’ll keep this room another day and settle the bill later. Ensure our camels are well-fed, understood?”

The attendant nodded eagerly. As Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong prepared to leave, Yue Gao came bounding up the stairs, a large sack slung over his shoulder.

Panting heavily, he exclaimed, “Good—you haven’t left yet! Thank the stars I ran fast enough!”

“What’s happened? Is something wrong? Why this urgency?” Guan Yu inquired, suspecting new complications regarding the Wan Manor affair.

Yue Gao grinned. “Can’t I seek you out without trouble? Aren’t we friends? I simply wish to treat you to a meal—is that so strange?”

“Delightful!” Wang Xiaorong accepted before Guan Yu could decline.

Though Yue Gao struck Guan Yu as honorable and trustworthy, the young man remained wary. His current mission demanded discretion, and mingling with those connected to government officials posed risks. After all, multiple factions—not just the Demonic Soul Sect—coveted the high-grade magical artifacts he carried. The more his identity became known, the greater the danger.

“I deeply admire you, Guan Yu,” Yue Gao continued earnestly. “Your swift deduction of the Wan Manor mystery was masterful. I wish to learn from you—you possess qualities worth emulating.”

Since Wang Xiaorong had already accepted the invitation, Guan Yu acquiesced. “Truthfully, we’ve already eaten. But we’ll join you for company. We depart tomorrow anyway.”

“Wonderful!” Wang Xiaorong clapped her hands in glee.

As they descended the stairs, Yue Gao inquired, “You mentioned leaving tomorrow—where to?”

“My companion and I plan to venture into the desert,” Guan Yu replied vaguely. “I’ve always favored adventures.”

Yue Gao ordered a lavish spread. While the men drank, Wang Xiaorong sampled every dish with relish. Though many dishes resembled those from Yan Zhao’s feast the previous night, these humbler preparations delighted her palate.

“Your tolerance impresses me,” Yue Gao remarked after multiple rounds. “In my family, heavy drinking runs in the blood. Yet you match me cup for cup without faltering!”

“Heredity favors me similarly,” Guan Yu deflected, unwilling to explain his cultivation-enhanced constitution.

Wang Xiaorong preened, “Naturally! The man I chose excels in all things.”

“Aptly named ‘Mei Mei’ (Beauty),” Yue Gao observed with an amused glint, recognizing the pseudonym yet keeping his counsel.

When Yue Gao offered to guide them the next day, Wang Xiaorong’s initial reluctance melted under Guan Yu’s diplomatic acceptance. Soon they rattled westward in Yue Gao’s carriage toward Peach Blossom Mountain.

The journey grew bumpier as they left town. “We’re taking shortcuts,” Yue Gao explained. “The mountain lies ten li ahead.”

When the rosy slopes finally appeared, Wang Xiaorong gasped in wonder. “Heavens! It’s breathtaking!”

Indeed, the wild peach trees crowned the heights in pink profusion, their sterile blossoms destined never to fruit. Vendors harvested these untamed boughs freely, creating a thriving trade for townsfolk unwilling to make the trek.

“Let’s climb!” Wang Xiaorong urged, clutching the blossoms Guan Yu had bought her.

As they ascended through fragrant air, Guan Yu marveled at nature’s spectacle—a tourist magnet in another world, here simply existed, ephemeral and unclaimed. The carriage creaked onward, carrying them deeper into petals and possibilities.
