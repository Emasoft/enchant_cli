“What? What on earth are you talking about?” Lan Yu appeared confused before continuing, “Don’t you like this coincidence? I think it’s fate! Hehehe, maybe Heaven arranged for us to meet here on the same flight.

Quick, show me your ticket! Let’s see if our seats are next to each other. Hurry!” Lan Yu exclaimed excitedly.

After snatching Guan Yu’s ticket, Lan Yu let out a piercing shriek that nearly deafened him. “Heavens! Our seats are actually adjacent! Hahaha, this is perfect!” She hugged Guan Yu and shook him wildly, brimming with joy.

Guan Yu now believed this was indeed a remarkable coincidence. “Are you traveling alone?” he asked.

“Yes! Whenever I’m bored at home, I go out by myself. Mom and Dad are always busy, and you’re never around either. So I explore on my own—it’s freeing!” Lan Yu chirped.

“How nice. I’d actually planned to visit Boss Lan for drinks and check on you soon. Never thought I’d bump into you here,” Guan Yu said with a chuckle, his words light and insincere—mere placations for a child.

Yet Lan Yu, ever trusting, swallowed his lies wholeheartedly. “See? Heaven arranged this because I missed you so much! By the way, are you heading to Japan for work?”

Guan Yu considered bringing her along. Since Jieyu Lang and Yingzi already knew he had many women, one more wouldn’t matter. Plus, letting this naive girl wander alone seemed risky.

“I’m traveling too. Listen—you can’t roam solo anymore. My enemies are numerous, and if they caught you... Visit your sisters in Qiaoyuan District when bored, understand?”

“Of course! I’ll obey whatever you say,” Lan Yu nodded obediently.

“Good. Since you’re so well-behaved, I’ll take you along this time. Agreed?”

“Yes! I’ll follow you everywhere! Yay!” Lan Yu clung to Guan Yu’s arm like sticky rice cake as boarding announcements blared, refusing to let go as if he might vanish.

Her Mickey Mouse-patterned mask lent a playful charm to her eager compliance.

When Xue Jing returned home, A’mei rushed over. “Sister Jing! What happened? Where’s Guan Yu?”

“That scoundrel! He used the police to ditch me!” Xue Jing snarled, viciously biting into a strawberry as though it were Guan Yu’s flesh. After recounting events, A’mei gasped, “That deputy director is lawless! We must tell Guan Yu!”

“How? He’s vanished. If I inform the elder sisters, he’ll be punished upon return. Better keep this hidden and pray he comes back soon.”

A’mei understood—Xue Jing shielded Guan Yu despite prior scoldings for withholding his travels. Another secrecy breach would invite wrath upon both. Resigned, Xue Jing resolved to handle the deputy director herself.

Calling Yang Conghan, Xue Jing demanded, “The deputy director of Kaihuang分局 harassed me. Ensure he’s removed by tomorrow.”

Yang exhaled in relief—she’d feared her collusion with Guan Yu’s escape was exposed. “Consider it done,” she pledged before hastily hanging up, unnerving Xue Jing.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Lan Yu boarded joyfully. “How’s Boss Lan’s business?” Guan Yu asked.

“No idea! He only tells me if troubles arise. Mom says he’s been busy—even took her to parties after she suspected infidelity.” Lan Yu giggled.

“Your stepmother seems formidable!”

“Actually...” Lan Yu hesitated. “She’s my stepmom. My birth mother died long ago. Dad waited until I met you to remarry—I insisted.”

Guan Yu nodded. “How is she toward you?”

“Polite, but distant. Dad limits our contact to avoid conflict.”

“Why not move to Qiaoyuan District? You’d enjoy living with your sisters.”

Lan Yu brightened. “Yes! Once we return, I’ll ask Dad. The more people there, the better!”

“Why?”

“If rooms fill up, I’ll share yours!” she teased, tongue poking out.

Guan Yu chuckled nervously—twenty occupied rooms would be his doom.

Upon landing, Guan Yu confessed, “I’m here to retrieve a girl I promised to years ago—before amnesia.”

Lan Yu gaped. “Another girl? Have you regained memories?”

“Not yet, but this trip might help. Let’s eat while I contact Jieyu Lang.”

Exiting the airport, Guan Yu faltered—language barriers loomed. Lan Yu brandished her phone. “This app translates in real-time via human interpreters! We’re covered!”

“Impressive. Let’s call Jieyu to plan our next move.”

As they navigated the foreign bustle, Guan Yu steeled himself. Even if his elder sisters summoned him home, he’d stay—Yingzi’s retrieval was nonnegotiable.
