The ground was already stained with blood, terrifying the long-haired woman into incessant screams. She remained oblivious to the impending danger as the crowd’s eyes followed the trajectory of the short-haired woman’s swinging handbag. Everyone knew this woman had lost all reason—today, it seemed two lives would be claimed.

Jinhua initially moved to intervene, but Guanyu yanked her back. She shot him a reproachful glance, questioning why he stopped her.

Guanyu shook his head slightly and whispered, “In places like this, with matters like these, it’s best we don’t interfere. Let fate decide.”

Though Jinhua understood his meaning—helping might invite trouble or danger—she couldn’t bear to watch the woman’s murderous rampage.

“Fine, I’ll listen to you,” Jinhua replied. With so many bystanders, perhaps someone would step forward. Even one person could stop this madness.

Otherwise, lives would surely be lost today. These spectators, so quick to snap photos of others’ humiliation, were unlikely to intervene in a brawl.

No one wanted blood on their hands. Letting the chaos unfold while they gawked seemed their sole purpose.

***

*Bang!*

Another crash echoed as the short-haired woman, feral as a beast, slammed her bag into the long-haired woman’s skull. The victim collapsed without a sound.

Undeterred, the assailant continued battering her. If unchecked, the two on the ground would be beaten to death. This deranged woman wouldn’t stop unless restrained—her frenzy was horrifying.

**Chapter 2,901: No One Wants to Intervene**

Just as Jinhua could no longer stand idle and prepared to act, a man rushed forward, seizing the short-haired woman’s bag. “Stop!” he shouted. “You’ll kill them!”

“I want these adulterous dogs dead! Let them fuck in hell!” the woman shrieked, yanking futilely at her bag before resorting to kicking the prone long-haired woman.

The brawny man grabbed her collar and flung her backward. “I don’t care what happened,” he admonished. “Life is sacred! You’re committing murder—do you understand the consequences?”

“I’ll kill them! I don’t want to live anyway!” She scrambled up, ignoring her injuries, but the man blocked her path.

Shaking her shoulders, he roared, “What about your child? If you both die, who will care for them? Have you considered that?”

At the word “child,” the woman’s fury wavered. Sobbing, she spat, “That bastard never thought of us! Why should I care now? I’ll die fighting this scum today!”

A woman’s wrath, once ignited, surpasses a man’s in cruelty. Normally restrained, they become unstoppable when pushed beyond limits. This short-haired fiend, if unchecked, would indeed murder in cold blood—a chilling thought.

“He failed your child, but if you do the same, you’re no better,” the man reasoned, maintaining his grip. “Calm down. The truth might differ from what you think.”

His persuasion skills were sharp, leveraging parental duty to douse her rage—though with limited effect. Her crimson eyes burned solely for vengeance.

Guanyu’s eyes narrowed in recognition: the mediator was Qizhi, illuminated by overhead lights. Previously suspecting Qizhi of colluding with Bill Lin without evidence, Guanyu now reassessed. A covert operative wouldn’t risk exposure here. Qizhi’s intervention saved lives, painting him in a nobler light.

The short-haired woman wailed on the ground as Qizhi checked the victims. “Superficial injuries,” he muttered. “But you provoked this.”

To everyone’s shock, the frail man—seemingly near death—sat up abruptly.

“You’re alive?” Qizhi gaped.

“I fainted to escape her blows,” the man admitted, rubbing his head.

Relieved, Qizhi advised, “An ambulance is coming. Take her to the hospital.” He gestured to the long-haired woman, whose knees and elbows were scraped bloody.

Seeing her husband unharmed, the short-haired woman—Erjuan—softened momentarily. “How could you betray us?” she wept. “Our daughter is only nine!”

Liang Yuefa coughed. “Erjuan, she’s my boss’s daughter. Harming her ruins us both.”

“You bastard!” Erjuan screamed. “I’ll die dragging you to hell!”

**Chapter 2,902: A Stupid Mistake**

Liang’s affair with his superior’s daughter explained his recklessness. The younger, affluent woman offered a ladder up—a temptation outweighing his weathered wife.

“Must you always curse?” Liang snapped. “Have some dignity!”

“Dignity? You lost yours bedding her!” Erjuan retorted. Onlookers chuckled as someone yelled, “Put on a show for us!”

Guanyu sighed. Erjuan’s vulgar outbursts revealed a domineering nature. Liang, emasculated at home, sought validation elsewhere—a common catalyst for infidelity.

Erjuan’s rage reignited. “They’re flirting even now! Film them, everyone!”

Qizhi restrained her. “You’ll face assault charges! Think of your daughter—do you want her mother jailed?”

The maternal plea quelled Erjuan’s fury. Meanwhile, Liang fawned over Xiaoyuan, his boss’s daughter. “I’ll protect you,” he vowed, helping her rise.

Xiaoyuan slapped him. “You coward! You played dead while I was beaten!”

“I had to! She’s a tigress!” Liang whimpered.

“Who’s a tigress?” Erjuan seethed, lunging again until Qizhi blocked her.

“Another strike means heavier charges,” he warned. “Your daughter deserves better!”

**Chapter 2,903: Taking Sides**

Liang, now obsequious, tended to Xiaoyuan’s wounds. “The ambulance will take you to the hospital,” he cooed, prioritizing his career over his marriage.

Erjuan, watching them, sneered, “Put on a porn show for the crowd!”

Jeers and laughter followed. Guanyu shook his head. Liang’s pathetic groveling and Erjuan’s vulgarity painted a bleak portrait of a marriage’s collapse—a tragedy born of neglect, ambition, and pride.
