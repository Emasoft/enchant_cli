“Where is the surveillance room?” Guan Yu asked, seeing the bodyguard no longer wished to lie and knowing the Feng family wouldn’t entrust such crucial information to a mere guard.

“Th-that way… westernmost end of North Building Two,” the trembling man stammered. Guan Yu knocked him unconscious with a sharp blow and scanned the area—the spot seemed secure enough to avoid detection.

*North Building Two’s westernmost side—the second floor’s farthest west room.* After confirming the location, Guan Yu stealthily moved along the outer iron railings.

Entering through the building’s interior was impossible; every corridor bristled with cameras. Scaling the second floor’s exterior posed no challenge. With a leap, he grabbed the stone ledge of an open window, catching whiffs of strong alcohol and the rumble of snores from within.

*Perfect timing—they’re drunk and asleep.* Muscling himself up, he slit the screen with his combat dagger and slipped into the surveillance room.

An entire wall of monitors displayed every corner of the building. Two men lay snoring on a small couch. Guan Yu struck each at the base of their skulls, then slapped their faces twice to confirm they were truly out.

Finding the main power switch, he cut the feed. Fearing an alarm, he disabled the security system entirely. After changing into a guard’s uniform, he strode confidently into the hallway.

Creeping soundlessly through the second floor’s many rooms, he deduced the Eternal Demonic Realm wouldn’t be stored in an ordinary space. Finding nothing unusual, he descended to the first floor—a maze of hotel-like private rooms. Realizing this wasn’t the main building, he noted the disconnected structures.

Exiting North Building, he observed East Building’s heavy surveillance and patrolling guards. Disguised as one of them, he swaggered forward until a voice called out: “Hey, buddy! Haven’t seen you before.”

Trapped in a crowded area, Guan Yu turned with a grin. “Ah! You’re… uh…”

“Fifth Brother,” slurred the fortyish man, reeking of alcohol.

“Right, Fifth Brother! Don’t you remember me? We drank together last week! I’m on monitor duty tonight.” Guan Yu slung an arm around the man’s shoulders, steering him toward a corner while gripping his dagger, ready to strike if needed.

“Oh right! You’re Little Wang!” the man mumbled.

“Exactly! I might need your help soon—don’t forget me!” Guan Yu handed him a box of Honghe Dao cigarettes—luxury smokes priced over two thousand Huaxia yuan per carton, pilfered from the Sun family’s storeroom.

The man pocketed them without looking. “No need for formalities! Just ask—I’m the head guard here. Got pull.”

“Then I’ll rely on you, Fifth Brother.” Guan Yu turned toward East Building.

“Whoa! Drunk already?” Fifth Brother grabbed his arm. “Guards aren’t allowed there. You’ll get in trouble.”

“Ah! Thought this was North Building!” Guan Yu chuckled as two Mercedes vans roared into the compound.

They snapped to attention as the vehicles parked. Long legs emerged first—two beauties stepped out, followed by four more women hauling Young Master Feng’s wheelchair. The heir groped at his scantily clad attendants while being carried inside.

“Damn. Fresh cabbage trampled by pigs,” Fifth Brother muttered.

Suppressing a laugh—*Doesn’t that insult include himself?*—Guan Yu noted the underground parking entrance. After excusing himself, he slipped into East Building.

The lavish lobby, devoid of cameras, held two maids cleaning late. They oddly departed as if hearing his mental curses.

Searching the empty hall, he ruled out the Eternal Demonic Realm being there. Upstairs, moans and giggles leaked from Young Master Feng’s room—equipped with BDSM gear and torture tools. Guan Yu retreated, certain the relic wasn’t in such a den.

Another opulent door tempted him. Blowing sleep-inducing incense through the keyhole, he picked the lock. Inside, Patriarch Feng snored between four women. A fruitless search later, Guan Yu exited—only to corner a startled maid.

“Shh!” He pressed a hand over her mouth. “I risked everything to see you! You’ve haunted my dreams since we met. Could you… love me?”

The maid’s eyes widened—then narrowed seductively. She gestured to a side room. Releasing her, he prepared to strike if she screamed.

“Let’s talk there,” she whispered, leading him to a laundry room.

Once inside, she pounced—revealing buck teeth and garish lips. “Hahaha! Fresh meat! Come to mama!”

A chop to her neck dropped her. Hiding the unconscious woman under sheets, Guan Yu nearly collided with another maid entering. He subdued her too.

Escaping East Building, he headed West Building. The lemon-scented lobby oozed feminine luxury—purple dominates a circular bed-draped hall. Upstairs, a walk-in closet revealed young women’s apparel. A hidden sliding door led to a pitch-black chamber where a figure slept on floor bedding.

Noticing an en suite bathroom sans walls, Guan Yu crept closer—and froze at the sleeper’s soft breaths.
