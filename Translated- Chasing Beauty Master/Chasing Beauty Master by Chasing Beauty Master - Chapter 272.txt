“Liu Bingrong's face turned deathly pale, beads of sweat the size of peas dripped incessantly from his forehead. His hands trembled uncontrollably as if he had aged ten years in an instant. He staggered away from the gambling table, found a nearby chair and collapsed into it like a sack of potatoes.

In one night, after borrowing 600,000 from the casino, he'd lost a total of 900,000.

Nine hundred thousand! For Liu Bingrong who barely qualified as middle-class, this was a thunderbolt from clear skies. What made it fatal was that 600,000 of this sum came from casino loans.

He knew the casino's ways all too well - money talks, people walk. If he failed to repay on time... Liu Bingrong shuddered. He'd heard stories of people disappearing after leaving casinos, their rotting corpses found in remote wilderness weeks later, faces unrecognizable. The mere thought terrified him.

600,000 meant ruin for Liu Bingrong. Fear spread through his veins like ice water.

Then came worse terror.

The casino's enforcers approached, their casual demeanor belying the chill they exuded - men who might not have committed murder but knew their way around bloodshed.

"Since you borrowed 600k from our casino, you'll come with us," one thug said coldly.

Liu Bingrong stammered, "Where... where are you taking me?"

"Quit yapping. You'll find out." The enforcer glared, voice sharpening.

Sensing mortal danger, Liu Bingrong blurted, "Family matters to settle! I'll repay on time, I swear!" He turned to flee.

Prepared enforcers seized him, dragging him away despite his screams for help. They hauled him into a dimly lit chamber where cold air raised goosebumps. Squinting at elongated shadows under weak lighting, he knew what came next.

The room reeked of urine. Liu Bingrong begged, "Boss, spare me! I'll repay within a week!"

A sneer cut through darkness: "You? Earn 600k in seven days?"

"I'll mortgage my house!"

"Your dump of a house isn't worth half that!" The voice mocked. "You've got a week... or we harvest your organs."

Liu Bingrong's bowels turned to water. "Three days! I'll bring cash!"

"Three days?" The voice laughed cruelly. "Even three months wouldn't get you 60k. Which idiot loaned you money? Cut his hand off!"

Trembling, Liu Bingrong signed a shadowy document. When light flooded the room, he gaped in shock.

The "boss" stood revealed - his daughter's boyfriend.

"Y-you?!" Liu Bingrong's jaw dropped.

"Father selling his daughter?" The young man's voice dripped ice. "We'll discuss this... at the riverbank."

Sixth Chapter Ninety-One: To the Depths

The room fell deathly silent.

Liu Bing荣's face drained of color. His final gamble had failed catastrophically.
