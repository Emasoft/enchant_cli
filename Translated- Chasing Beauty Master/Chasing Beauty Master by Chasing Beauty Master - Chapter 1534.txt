However, upon seeing Xiao Zhi dressed in silks and satins, the onlookers recognized him as a wealthy young master. In this era where connections and status reigned supreme, one couldn’t afford to offend those from privileged families.

The rich always trampled over the poor. Without money, one couldn’t hold their head high, and the impoverished were perpetually scorned by the wealthy.

“Who dares sneak up on this young lady?” Wang Jun suddenly shouted from behind. Xiao Zhi turned, puzzled by the commotion.

Wang Jun stormed forward, annoyed. Earlier, while blending into the crowd as a “couple” with Xiao Zhi, they had stood close. But after Xiao Zhi stepped away, Wang Jun—left alone—felt a chill on his back before someone roughly grabbed his waist, provoking his outburst.

“What’s wrong?” Xiao Zhi asked curiously.

“Someone dared take liberties with this young lady! Outrageous! Was it you?” Wang Jun angrily pointed at bystanders, sending them scrambling back.

Xiao Zhi glanced at Wang Jun’s flimsy attire and stifled a laugh. *Serves you right, parading around in such scant clothing. Surrounded by men, a delicate young woman like you was bound to attract trouble.*

But he wondered how the perpetrator would react upon learning Wang Jun was actually male.

“Forget it. No one will confess,” Xiao Zhi said, approaching before bursting into laughter. Wang Jun’s elegant white gown now bore five grimy handprints starkly visible on the lower back.

“What’s so funny? Mind your teeth in this wind!” Wang Jun snapped.

“You’d better change your dress. That black handprint is glaring. Honestly, couldn’t the culprit have washed their hands first?” Xiao Zhi chuckled.

Wang Jun tugged the skirt to inspect the damage. The finger marks resembled intentional embroidery, fueling his fury. “This is infuriating! I just stepped out, and already my dress is ruined. I’ll find the scoundrel and teach them a lesson!”

Xiao Zhi waved a hand. “Good luck searching this crowd. You’ll disrupt the performers’ livelihood.”

Wang Jun had planned to inspect hands for matching dirt, but relented. The duo performing needed their earnings, and a commotion would ruin their act.

Xiao Zhi stepped forward, addressing the troublemaker coldly: “Leave. Don’t delay the show.”

The man, noting Xiao Zhi’s noble bearing, slunk away, not daring to provoke a wealthy patron. The young performer bowed gratefully, hammer in hand.

The act resumed. A man lay beneath a stone slab, face flushed from prolonged pressure. With a resounding *clang*, the performer struck the slab, splitting it cleanly. The “master” rose, dusting himself off as the crowd cheered.

But Wang Jun spotted the trick: the slab’s fracture was pre-cut, glued for easy breakage. Still, he held his tongue—these were mere entertainers, not true deceivers.

“You’ve heard of ‘descending into the oil wok’!” the master announced. “Today, I’ll prove my Iron Sand Palm fears no heat!”

A cauldron bubbled over flames. Skeptics tossed potatoes in, greeted by violent sizzling. Wang Jun approached, then smiled knowingly—the “oil” was mostly water below a thin layer, boiling at lower temperatures.

“Aren’t you worried?” Xiao Zhi whispered as the master prepared to dip his hand.

Wang Jeered: “It’s a trick. Mostly water and vinegar. The real oil’s just a surface show.”

The master plunged his hand in, retrieving the potato unharmed. Coins rained into the collection plate.

Xiao Zhi moved to expose the fraud, but Wang Jun stopped him. “Leave it. Let the crowd enjoy the spectacle. We’ve bigger matters.”

As they departed, Xiao Zhi mused: “Maybe I’ll try this scam someday.”

Wang Jun’s eyes lit up. “Why wait? Let’s out-swindle those swindlers!”

At a tailor’s, Wang Jun reverted to male attire, transforming Xiao Zhi into an elderly sage. Their new personas—master and apprentice fortune-tellers—required props: a table, ink, and chemically treated paper.

Their booth soon attracted a septuagenarian seeking romance advice. Wang Jun deadpanned: “Your wife recently passed, yes?”

The man gaped. Wang Jun pressed a treated paper to his palm, revealing a “miraculous” handprint. Thus began their charlatan’s dance—a game of illusions mirroring the world around them.
