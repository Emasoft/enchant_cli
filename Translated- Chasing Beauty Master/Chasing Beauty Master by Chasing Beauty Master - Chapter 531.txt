“No sooner had these words left his mouth than Guanyu let out a wicked chuckle. He seized Bikamao’s tail and hurled the creature to the ground, cursing, ‘You damned cat! Truly proving the saying—three days without a beating and you’ll tear the roof tiles! Keep pretending with me, and I’ll stew you alive!’”

Bikamao sighed. “Is this how one treats a friend? How utterly heartless!”

Guanyu smirked but said nothing more. His gaze lingered on the Heaven-tier cultivation manual. Suddenly, a throbbing pain seized his skull as if he’d been drugged.

Unaware of when he drifted off, Guanyu dreamed of transforming into a wooden puppet. Those indecipherable magical runes morphed into fiery characters that pummeled his meridians relentlessly. He tried to flee but found his body paralyzed.

The next morning, before dawn, clamorous voices roused him. Blinking groggily, he glimpsed a shadowy figure swaying before him. He lunged—a shrill *meow* pierced the air—and an electric jolt coursed through his body.

**Chapter 1344: The Bait and Switch**

Startled fully awake, Guanyu found Bikamao cowering in a corner. “Don’t blame me! Amy told me to wake you!”

“Amy? You mean she’s already been here?” Guanyu demanded.

Bikamao nodded. “Over two hours ago. The competition’s about to start. If you don’t hurry, it’ll be finished!”

Guanyu froze. *The competition’s begun? Why didn’t the elders summon me? Wait…* His head still swam, and he realized—last night’s drowsiness hadn’t been natural. *This must be Patriarch Allen’s scheme to keep me from participating.*

He bolted up, gritting against the pain. Dressing hastily, he rushed to the training grounds.

The roar of the crowd greeted him from afar. *The entire elven clan must be here. Such fervor for the chieftain election!*

Squeezing through the throng, he spotted two figures on the platform: Patriarch Allen and Elder Carter.

“Elder Carter,” Allen’s voice carried clearly, “I hear you’ve reached advanced Archmage rank. Any recent breakthroughs?”

The wizened elder chuckled. “Patriarch, though my cultivation falls short of yours, mockery ill becomes you. Win or lose, I’ll fight with all I have!”

Crimson flames erupted from Carter’s palms—swift and lethal, yet Allen sidestepped effortlessly. A gossamer orange net materialized around the patriarch, ensnaring Carter in azure energy bonds.

*The gap in power!* Two moves decided the match. Both had held back, avoiding lethal force, yet the crowd buzzed with awe. “Truly our clan’s foremost expert! The other elders pale in comparison!”

Locke watched Carter’s defeat impassively, as if expecting it. Mounting the platform, he declared, “A valiant display, Patriarch, but this is merely the first round. Lose the next two, and you know the consequences.”

With a glance, Locke summoned Elder Kyle. “Though unremarkable,” Kyle sneered, “crushing minor pests poses no difficulty. Wouldn’t you agree, Brother Fiat?”

The challenge hung between two rival elders—Kyle at peak Archmage rank, Fiat a middling one. Hostility simmered beneath their formal roles.

“Kyle, you venomous relic!” Fiat spat. “Decades of scheming haven’t quenched your treachery. Think your paltry strength impresses me? You’re less than dung in my eyes!”

Kyle’s beard quivered with rage. “Cease your prattle! I’ll silence that tongue permanently!”

Their clash turned vicious—no quarter given. Guanyu watched grimly. *Kyle groveled before Wei Buqun, yet turns tyrant against kin. This cancer must be excised from the Elvenwoods.*

As their duel escalated, Allen observed stoically. *Some conflicts demand resolution. Two tigers cannot share one mountain.* He prayed for minimal casualties.

After brutal exchanges, Kyle’s earth-tier technique struck Fiat’s chest, flooring him. When Kyle moved for the kill, Allen intervened. “Sparring requires restraint, Elder. Explain this bloodlust.”

Kyle retreated, smirking. “Merely ensuring he stays down. Since he lacks fight, I’ll show mercy.”

**Chapter 1345: Decisive Victory?**

Guanyu’s jaw clenched at Kyle’s hypocrisy. *How I long to thrash him!* Yet he held back—his turn would come.

Allen’s heart sank. Fiat’s loss meant their next bout must succeed against steep odds.

“For the third match,” the announcer proclaimed, “Locke versus… Shituo!”

Murmurs rippled. “Wasn’t the dragon youth scheduled? Has he fled?”

“Coward! So much for draconic pride!”

Guanyu snorted. *Frogs in a well, croaking ignorance. How pitiful.*

Amid the uproar, Allen clarified, “Our draconic ally fell ill. Shituo graciously substitutes.”

Jeers erupted. “Ill? More like terrified! Call him ‘hero’? ‘Coward’ fits better!”

Shituo’s roar silenced them. “Silence, vermin! I’ll purge this filth myself!”

Locke sneered, “Old fool! Three moves will end you!”

Their clash became mortal combat—Shituo’s brute force against Locke’s deceptively soft strikes. When Shituo exposed his back, Guanyu shouted, “Leap now!”

Shituo obeyed. A Rootless Flame scorched where he’d stood—pale fire only evadable, never quenched.

Locke scowled. “Lucky dodge. But three moves remain!”

The duel intensified until Locke’s flames slammed Shituo down. As Locke moved for the kill, Guanyu’s energy blade hurled him back.

“You!” Locke gaped. “You abandoned the Elvenwoods!”

Guanyu smirked. “Abandoned? News to me.”

Recovering, Locke jeered, “Returning changes nothing. I’ve won. Defy me, and the entire clan will crush you!”

“Deluded fool. *I* am the true third contestant. Your victory over Shituo means nothing.”

Locke whirled to Allen. “So this is your honor? Treacherous snake!”

Unflinching, Allen remained silent. Guanyu addressed the crowd. “Who desires a true deciding match?”

**Chapter 1346: To Whom the Crown?**

A forest of hands rose—exactly as Guanyu anticipated. Spectacle mattered more than politics to the masses.

Locke seethed at the mob’s fickleness. *Mindless sheep!*

“Well, Locke?” Guanyu taunted. “Defy popular will? Or… are you afraid?”

“Recall our last encounter,” Locke hissed. “Who sent you tumbling off Tigerhead Cliff?”

“You,” Guanyu acknowledged. “Yet here I stand. Some challenges demand acceptance.”

“Fool! Overreach spells death.”

“Death over dullness,” Guanyu shot back. “My compass points only to justice.”

Locke’s eyes narrowed. “Justice? Serve me and live. Oppose me, and—”

“Enough talk. Let steel decide!”
