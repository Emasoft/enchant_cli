“Guan Yu certainly understood that bringing all these things was for his sake, and he truly felt indebted to Jinci Wolf. Guan Yu said, 'Brother Jinci, you should rest here for a few days. There's another matter I need your help with—you may have to make another trip back.'

'What? You can't be serious! I just returned, and you're sending me off again? Are you worried about things at home?' Jinci Wolf grumbled like an old woman. 'Don't fret about Qiaoyuan District. Even if a large force tried to attack it now, it would take them considerable time. Everything’s secure there, so put your mind at ease.'

'It’s not that I’m worried. There’s another matter.' Guan Yu took out the photograph of Miss Yezi and placed it on the table.

Jinci Wolf glanced at the picture of the lovely young girl, rolled his eyes at Guan Yu, and remained silent. He pulled out his phone and fiddled with it, muttering, 'Ugh, what a hassle. I was planning to play a few rounds of mahjong, but there’s no signal here. Forgot all about that—this thing’s useless now.'

'Heh, the only functions left are taking photos and videos. But even that’s miraculous here. No one’s ever seen such a device,' Guan Yu chuckled.

**Chapter 3629: The Difficulty of Finding Someone**

'Brother Jinci, I need you to find the girl in this photo, relay some information to her, and ideally bring her here. Once she arrives, take her directly to Master Jiu at the back mountain,' Guan Yu instructed.

'Master Jiu?' Jinci Wolf had stayed with Guan Yu at the back mountain before and knew Master Jiu was a decent man. 'Who is this girl? The photo looks old. I thought she might be another lover of yours, but apparently not.'

'Another lover? You make me sound like a philanderer!' Guan Yu protested.

'Aren’t you? What man who isn’t a womanizer keeps a harem at home while fooling around outside? You’re one of a kind,' Jinci Wolf sneered.

Guan Yu straightened. 'Brother Jinci, that’s unfair. I don’t go around seducing women—they come to me. Can you blame me? What man could resist beautiful women throwing themselves at him?'

'Always with the excuses. Whatever you say. So who is she, and why find her?'

Guan Yu sat down, noticing a bag of beef jerky on the table—a rare treat here. He opened it and began eating. 'This woman, Yezi, saved Master Jiu’s life twenty years ago. She’s from our homeland. I’m helping Master Jiu locate her.'

'Are you serious? Is the jerky that bad?' Jinci Wolf exclaimed.

'It’s delicious. Why? The packaging’s in foreign script—probably brought by Yingzi.'

'Exactly! I thought maybe it choked you. Think about it: a twenty-year-old photo? How am I supposed to find someone based on that? She’d look completely different now! It’s like searching for a needle in a haystack across all of China!'

Jinci Wolf shook his head. 'I won’t take this fool’s errand. Find someone else.'

Guan Yu pressed, 'Her name’s Yezi. Master Jiu taught her magic back then. You know spellcasters age slowly. Twenty years ago, she lived in Lianzhou. Ask around there—someone must remember her. Finding people isn’t that hard nowadays.'

'Easy for you to say! I don’t have connections in China. It’ll be a nightmare. I’d rather stay and protect you. Xue Jing ordered me not to leave your side.'

'I’m safe here. Help me progress faster in my training, break the seal sooner, and return home. Isn’t that worth aiding Master Jiu?'

'I get it, but—'

'Listen: take this photo to Yang Conghan. The Yang family’s network spans China. With time, she’ll find Yezi. Bring her back, and I’ll handle the rest.'

'Involving the Yangs? Risky. Xue Jing mentioned Yang Conghan hasn’t been seen for months. What if the Yangs turn against you?'

Guan Yu pondered. 'They won’t. The Yangs lack the strength to challenge Huayu Group. Even if they dared, they’d fail. Take the photo to my sisters at Huayu. Let them search. Just bring Yezi back—alive, dead, or with news. I owe Master Jiu an answer.'

'Since when did you become so devoted to Cloud Azure Sect? This isn’t like you. Unless... she’s a beauty? Or are you eyeing Master Jiu?'

'Don’t be absurd! You think I’d fancy an old man?'

'Who knows? This place might’ve warped you.'

Guan Yu sighed. 'Enough jokes. I’ve little time. I leave soon.'

'Where? Another mission from Xuanming?'

'Both a mission and a trial. Hardship accelerates my cultivation. Helping Master Jiu is fair—he’s charged my Imperial Seal multiple times. It’s saved my life.'

Jinci Wolf glared. 'Easy for you to promise favors, hard for me to deliver. You play the hero while I slog through mud.'

Guan Yu acknowledged Jinci Wolf’s efforts, knowing the assassin aided him largely for his sister’s sake. Having Yingzi in Qiaoyuan District had been wise. With a world-class killer as a guard, Guan Yu enjoyed unparalleled security—a privilege even the wealthy couldn’t buy.

**Chapter 3630: Must You Leave?**

'Brother Jinci, I’m deeply grateful. We’re beyond formalities.'

Guan Yu recalled Jinci Wolf’s near-death in the storm. 'Each realm has its laws. Next time, carry fewer foreign items. They disrupt balance, invite disasters.'

'You might be right. I’ll travel lighter. No more lightning dodging.'

'This jerky’s excellent. Thank Yingzi for me.'

'Your safety matters most. Oh, record a video for your women. Ease their worries.'

Guan Yu brightened. 'Brilliant idea.' He filmed a lengthy message until the phone died. Jinci Wolf stored it carefully—these clips meant everything to the women in Qiaoyuan District.

'Leaving soon for Xuanming’s task?'

'Yes. Senior Brother Yanzhao and I will depart. It may take weeks.' Guan Yu clasped Jinci Wolf’s shoulder. 'Finding Yezi isn’t urgent. Rest here first. Xuanming will host you well.'

'Forget me. Keep your head attached. If you die, those women will bury me alive.'

Guan Yu nodded. 'The flashlight and batteries might work once dried. The power banks too. I’ll take the food—useful for the desert.'

'They’re light. Take them all.'

Guan Yu packed the jerky, dried squid, and seafood into his homemade backpack—a sturdy hemp sack fashioned into a double-strapped pack, far superior to cloth bundles.

Onlookers gawked at the bulging bag as Guan Yu headed to Tiger’s Head Peak. The weight—mostly from batteries and power banks—was burdensome but necessary. Even if unusable, they could be repurposed into explosives, unheard of here.

Entering the hall, Guan Yu found it crowded. Xuanming sat enthroned, disciples gathered to bid farewell.

**Chapter 3631: A Moment’s Rest**

Xiao Zhi and Aze rushed over. 'We came to see you off!'

'Be careful out there. No heroics!' Xiao Zhi fussed.

Dai Shouzuo entered with disciples. Siqi approached. 'This mission is perilous, but I believe in you.'

Guan Yu smiled. 'Wait for my return.'

Aze poked the backpack. 'What’s this?'

'My own design. Holds plenty, very practical.'

'Genius! Who’d think of a pack like this?' Xiao Zhi marveled.

Xuanming rose. 'Silence! These two are my finest disciples. They’ll succeed—doubt them not!'

After pompous speeches, Guan Yu and Yanzhao departed. Yanzhao’s venomous gaze unsettled Guan Yu. Their route matched Wang Xiaorong’s calculations, leading to her town.

Without horses—most disciples flew on swords—the pair trekked. Heavy packs made sustained flight impractical. The journey began.
