**On the mountain, the most formidable cultivator was Jiu Buyun (Leek Indestructible Fortune), a veritable First-Class Esteemed Expert. Next came Big Zai and Second Zai, who approached the realm of First-Class Esteemed Experts, their cultivation already surpassing the strength of Second-Class Esteemed Upper Rank practitioners.**

**As for Yuan Shanding (Mountain-Steadfast Yuan), his cultivation remained at Second-Class Esteemed Lower Rank. Among the fifty men he had brought, many possessed Second-Class Esteemed Lower Rank strength, with some even reaching Second-Class Esteemed Middle Rank.**

**Thus, Yuan Shanding’s fifty men were no ordinary force. Wherever deployed, they represented a terrifyingly potent faction.**

**The Poisonous Widow had indeed invited a formidable adversary.**

“Brother Yuan, please take a seat. You must be exhausted from the journey. Let’s drink to ease the fatigue.”

**Yuan Shanding and his men belonged to the Luo Mountain Pirates, a band accustomed to hearty feasts and drunken revelry on their mountain stronghold. Days without liquor were rare.**

“Hahaha! Excellent, let’s drink! Buyun, join us!” Yuan Shanding boomed with laughter.

**The Poisonous Widow had already dispatched servants to prepare meals for the newly arrived brethren outside. Such a large contingent deserved proper sustenance before undertaking her tasks.**

“Brother Yuan, I cannot thank you enough for your aid. This time, I’ve encountered grave trouble. Without your help, I’d have no choice but to flee.” The Poisonous Widow lamented tearfully.

Yuan Shanding raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Old Sister, who could possibly corner you so? You’re renowned as one of the Ten Great Villains, a First-Class Esteemed Expert, and command over a hundred brothers in the Dark Sun Organization. With such power, how could anyone dare challenge you?”

**Yuan Shanding knew the Poisonous Widow’s influence well—unsurprising, given their longstanding camaraderie.**

The Poisonous Widow shook her head helplessly. “When I first came here, it was for a treasure map. But an old relative found me and begged me to kill someone. I thought it trivial, so I agreed. Little did I know the target, Guan Yu, was no ordinary man. Have you heard of him, Brother Yuan?”

Yuan Shanding shook his head. “Never. I’ve been secluded on the mountain, unconcerned with worldly affairs.”

“I hadn’t heard of him either,” the Poisonous Widow continued. “I assumed he was some wealthy young master—easy prey. But during our clash, I realized Guan Yu is extraordinary.”

She paused, draining her wine cup. “Guan Yu is surrounded by clouds of experts, connected to an underground cultivator organization, and leads a three-hundred-strong gang. They crushed me utterly.”

“That formidable?” Jiu Buyun interjected. “Facing such a foe requires careful planning, not rash action.”

“Indeed, Old Sister,” Yuan Shanding added. “You’ve never been impulsive. Why now…?”

The Poisonous Widow sighed. “I sent two subordinates to assassinate Guan Yu, but they failed. Then, as if prepared, Guan Yu marched his forces to my doorstep. I wasn’t initially afraid, but during the battle, I realized his experts outnumbered mine twofold. I nearly died myself, saved only by a friend’s intervention.”

Yuan Shanding leaned forward curiously. “This Guan Yu—is he truly so powerful? You’re a First-Class Esteemed Expert! How could anyone threaten you?”

“I too had faith in my cultivation,” she replied bitterly. “But Guan Yu’s side has multiple First-Class experts. Now, with my relatives slaughtered and Guan Yu seeking vengeance, I’ve no retreat. That’s why I begged your aid.”

**She omitted Bill Lynn’s involvement entirely. Better to frame this as her personal plight to secure Yuan Shanding’s wholehearted support.**

“Fear not, Old Sister!” Yuan Shanding thumped his chest. “Tomorrow, I’ll send men to investigate Guan Yu. Rest assured—I’ll help you eliminate this brat!”

“Let my remaining seventy subordinates handle the reconnaissance. Though diminished, they can still gather intelligence.”

**The Poisonous Widow exaggerated her losses to stoke Yuan Shanding’s resolve.**

Yuan Shanding stiffened. “Seventy left? You lost thirty cultivators in one battle? That’s no small loss! Recruiting thirty ordinary men is easy, but thirty cultivators? That’s near impossible!”

“Exactly! My heart aches for those lost. Brother Yuan, you must avenge this!” she implored mournfully.

Yuan Shanding drained his cup. “Worry not. Since I’m here, I’ll see this through.”

“Thank you, Brother Yuan! Let’s toast again!” The trio raised their cups...

Later, Jiu Buyun seized on a detail. “Old Sister, you mentioned a friend rescued you from Guan Yu’s siege? Who could breach such defenses?”

**Knowing Jiu Buyun’s penchant for piercing questions, the Poisonous Widow replied carefully,** “A recent acquaintance—a young master from an international magnate family.”

“Your friend’s cultivation is so high? He broke through Guan Yu’s encirclement?”

“Not him—his bodyguard. An elder with First-Class Esteemed Middle Rank strength. When that old man appeared, Guan Yu’s men didn’t dare approach.”

**Chapter 2,787: Life on the Mountain Isn’t Easy**

**The Poisonous Widow saw no need to lie here, as she planned to introduce Yuan Shanding to Bill Lynn. Bill Lynn would surely reward her for securing such powerful allies.**

“First-Class Esteemed Middle Rank…” Jiu Buyun murmured enviously. “To reach such heights—that’s awe-inspiring. Why seek our help if you have such friends?”

**She held her tongue, not wanting to provoke Yuan Shanding’s pride.**

“Old Sister,” Yuan Shanding said, “we should meet this friend! I’d love to witness a First-Class Middle Rank expert!”

“Of course. Rest tonight, Brother Yuan. Tomorrow, I’ll take you to him. He’ll be delighted.”

**After outlining Bill Lynn’s wealth and influence, Yuan Shanding remarked,** “A wealthy ally is valuable—especially for financial support.”

The Poisonous Widow chuckled. “Money is the least of his concerns. Should you need funds, he’ll provide.”

**Yuan Shanding’s mountain stronghold lagged in opulence. Though they raided caravans, expanding their ramshackle village of huts and caves required capital. Bill Lynn’s promised riches would ensure their loyalty.**

**That night, Yuan Shanding’s men crowded into the Poisonous Widow’s temporary base, originally built for a hundred. With her seventy remaining, space was tight but manageable.**

**At dawn, the Poisonous Widow led Yuan Shanding’s group to the Feng Family estate, where Bill Lynn hosted a lavish feast.**

**Post-banquet, in the East Hall’s parlor, Yuan Shanding praised the spread. Mountain fare paled against such delicacies. The Feng Estate’s four grand towers also impressed.**

“Such luxury!” Yuan Shanding exclaimed. “I’ve never seen its equal! The wealthy truly know how to live!”

**Bill Lynn, catching the Poisonous Widow’s glance, smiled modestly.** “Merely superficial trappings, Brother Yuan. Not as substantive as your mountain vigor.”

Jiu Buyun nodded. “As splendid as this is, I miss our mountain’s freedom and clean air. The city reeks of pollution.”

“True,” Bill Lynn conceded. “Urban glamour masks suffocating smog. Your mountain tranquility has its charms.”

The Poisonous Widow steered the talk. “Enough pleasantries. Let’s discuss strategy.”

“Right!” Yuan Shanding agreed. “We must plan meticulously. Old Sister claims Guan Yu’s forces grow stronger with each clash. Direct assault risks heavy losses.”

Bill Lynn nodded. “Guan Yu’s cunning and preparedness make him elusive. We must strike when he’s isolated outside his Qiao District stronghold.”

“Then we wait for his next outing!” Jiu Buyun declared.

**Bill Lynn admired their lawless pragmatism. Unlike society’s shackled masses, these rogues acted freely.**

“We’ll track his movements closely,” the Poisonous Widow urged. “No more mistakes.”

Yuan Shanding scoffed, emboldened by wine. “He’s just a man, not a god! With fifty cultivators and a First-Class Middle Rank expert, we’ll crush him!”

**Bill Lynn feigned concern.** “Brother Yuan, haste risks lives. Every prior attempt backfired. I won’t see your men slaughtered needlessly.”

Jiu Buyun frowned. “But our force is elite—mostly Second-Class Esteemed ranks. Even if Guan Yu rivals Elder Luo Bo, can he withstand us?”

**Earlier, Bill Lynn had introduced Luo Bo, a venerable expert, deepening Yuan Shanding’s respect.**

The Poisonous Widow countered, “Guan Yu routed my hundred cultivators. Yours are finer, but don’t underestimate him.”

Bill Lynn interjected, “We must ambush him outside Qiao District. A swift, lethal strike.”

“Then we await the perfect moment!” Jiu Buyun affirmed.

**Chapter 2,789: A Token of Goodwill**

**As discussions waned, Bill Lynn signaled a servant bearing a bulging dossier. He placed it before Yuan Shanding.**

“Brother Yuan, a humble gift for our new friendship. Consider it support for your mountain’s expansion.”

**Yuan Shanding’s eyes gleamed—the dossier brimmed with cash. For mountain dwellers, this fortune could transform their crude settlement.**

“You’re too kind, Brother Bill!” Yuan Shanding demurred, masking his thrill.

“A mere token. Should funds run short, ask freely.” **Bill Lynn aimed to bind Yuan Shanding directly, bypassing the Poisonous Widow.**

**With Yuan Shanding’s greed kindled, Bill Lynn secured a loyal blade. The stage was set for Guan Yu’s reckoning.**
