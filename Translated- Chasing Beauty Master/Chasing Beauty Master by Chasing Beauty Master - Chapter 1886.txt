“Hmph, truly delusional, still wishing to see Us?” The Emperor sneered, though he considered Lord Cao might indeed have something to say, and that there must be underlying circumstances. Otherwise, under such conditions, no one should have reason to harm him.

The incident spread swiftly. The Imperial Guards clashing violently with soldiers in the celestial prison—such momentous news had reached every corner of the court by morning.

Minister Qi, aware the plot had failed, was preparing to seek the Second Prince’s counsel when unexpectedly, a summons from the Emperor arrived.

With matters having escalated so far, there was nothing to do but proceed step by step, following prior arrangements. Minister Qi’s heart now lodged in his throat.

The Princess Royal also heard of the affair. In the Imperial Study, where only the Emperor and Yu Kong remained, she stood below the dais and asked, “Father Emperor, is Lord Cao unharmed? I cannot fathom why anyone would seek his death. Could he still have enemies even within the celestial prison?”

“Not quite,” the Emperor replied. “We believe someone seeks to silence him. Certain matters must not surface, and some fear Lord Cao might speak recklessly. Only his death would ensure secrets sink to the bottom of the sea forever. Those who fear exposure will inevitably move to eliminate him, denying him any chance to speak.”

He continued, “We had thought granting time might allow hidden truths to emerge or the guilty to betray themselves through haste. Yet never did We imagine such audacity—to attempt murder within the celestial prison itself! Outrageous!”

The Princess Royal said, “Father Emperor, since events have reached this pass, why not interrogate Lord Cao directly? Having endured this ordeal, he must realize his plight is hopeless. He would divulge all, sparing no one’s reputation.”

“Lord Cao has already spoken,” the Emperor revealed. “He claims the only ones desiring his death are the Qin family, who fear his testimony might implicate them.”

“But whether the Qins are truly involved, or what dreadful deeds they conceal—we cannot hastily conclude,” the Princess Royal cautioned. “Lord Cao may simply be dragging down scapegoats. His words cannot be wholly trusted.”

“This We well know,” the Emperor acknowledged. “Yet having failed this time, the plotters will find no further opportunities. The hour has come to try Lord Cao. The Cao affair must be resolved, sooner or later.”

Hearing this, the Princess Royal recalled her prior discussions with Jiang Yuan about entrusting the Cao matter to the Eldest Prince. Now seemed the perfect moment to propose it.

“Father Emperor,” she began, “Lord Cao’s boundless ambition led him to kidnap Xin’er for the Eastern Sea Dragon Pearl. Fortunately, the Eldest Prince’s wisdom saved her unharmed. Now that Lord Cao nearly perished in prison, perhaps this attack targets the Eldest Prince himself. I propose entrusting the Cao investigation to him. Those lurking in shadows may then surface more readily.”

The Emperor nodded, finding merit in her suggestion. As he pondered, a guard announced Minister Qi’s arrival.

Head bowed, Minister Qi hurried in and thudded to his knees. “Your Majesty, I swear no involvement in this affair! I beg Your Majesty’s fair judgment!”

Before the Emperor could speak, the minister’s self-defense provoked ire: “No involvement? Then who dispatched false Imperial Guards to the prison? The Guards fall under your command! Do you claim ignorance of your own men’s actions?”

Minister Qi kowtowed deeply. “Your Majesty, every Imperial Guard remains accounted for on duty. Those villains impersonated my Guards—this old subject knew nothing!”

The Emperor frowned. Counterfeit Guards? The prison captain had indeed reported anomalies among the assailants.

“Preposterous!” the Emperor thundered. “They bore Imperial Guard tokens, freely entering the prison! Dare you feign ignorance? Where lies your responsibility?”

“Your Majesty, each ten-man Guard unit is led by a squad captain bearing a token. All tokens remain accounted for. The imposters must have used exquisite forgeries.”

**Chapter 4957: Breeding Resentment**

Investigation confirmed the captured assailants carried counterfeit tokens—meticulous replicas indistinguishable from genuine ones at glance.

The perpetrators’ identities remained obscure, their interrogation fruitless—clearly, they were deathsworn agents.

This discovery spared Minister Qi immediate arrest, though summons replaced shackles.

“Even if not your men,” the Emperor growled, “you remain implicated. Those tokens were crafted with precision matching official work—how could outsiders replicate them without insider aid? This negligence falls squarely on you!”

“Your Majesty’s reprimand is just,” Minister Qi conceded. “This old subject bears responsibility and will investigate thoroughly, delivering satisfaction.”

Inwardly, Minister Qi sighed relief—the Emperor already knew of the impersonation. Fortunately, he’d kept reserves, avoiding complete compliance with the Second Prince’s rash orders.

“Useless!” the Emperor spat. “To let outsiders infiltrate Our prison—what good are you?”

“Father Emperor,” the Princess Royal interjected, “this matter reeks of conspiracy. These impersonators must have powerful backers. Entrusting further investigation to Minister Qi seems... unwise.”

Her implied suspicion stung, but Minister Qi held his tongue. With the Emperor enraged and the Princess Royal—though politically detached—being inviolable, protest risked disaster.

The Emperor concurred: “Well said. The token forgery’s precision suggests Guard complicity. This demands exhaustive inquiry.”

Prostrate, Minister Qi awaited judgment. Protest meant greater peril—better silent acceptance.

His resentment turned toward the Second Prince, whose haste bungled the scheme. Now bearing consequences alone while the Prince remained aloof, Minister Qi questioned his allegiance. Yet bound by vested interests, he swallowed bitterness.

**Chapter 4958: Shifting Allegiances**

When the Emperor surprisingly sought the Princess Royal’s counsel, Minister Qi marveled—uncharacteristic royal deference!

“Father Emperor,” she advised, “this requires disinterested competence. Only impartial handling will unveil truths.”

“Who then do you suggest?” the Emperor pressed.

Seizing the moment, the Princess Royal replied, “Though I abstain from court affairs, regarding Xin’er’s rescue, I’m eternally grateful to the Eldest Prince. Granting him this task would both honor his service and test his capabilities.”

Her framing as personal gratitude, not political stance, disarmed opposition.

The Emperor, long disillusioned with Second Prince’s faction, agreed: “So be it. Yu Kong, deliver Our edict—the Eldest Prince shall investigate forthwith.”

Minister Qi’s dread mounted. Though underestimating the Eldest Prince’s prowess, exposure risked catastrophe without the Second Prince’s protection.

Resolved, Minister Qi vowed to eliminate loose ends.

Meanwhile, the Eldest Prince received the edict with the Yellow Jacket’s authority—symbolic armor empowering him to extract prisoners and confront high treason.

Knowing this poisoned chalice meant得罪powerful foes, he embraced it as opportunity. Previous successes with Xin’er’s rescue had restored imperial favor—now was his moment.

As Eunuch Yu Kong departed sans customary bribes, the Prince’s courteous dismissal spoke volumes—here stood one unbound by corrupt rituals, a wildcard in the court’s deadly game.
