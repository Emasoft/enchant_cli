Elder Xiang continued, “Sect Leader, consider this – the Eight-Drum Technique must be secured by our sect at all costs. At the very least, we cannot let the Demon Soul Sect obtain it. This is currently our most urgent matter. As for Guan Yu’s invention, that’s an internal affair of our Yunqing Sect. Even if delayed by a few days, it’s inconsequential. Moreover, with Elder Wang from Zhenyang Sect present, as long as Guan Yu shares his expertise, Elder Wang and his team can undoubtedly replicate it.”

Seeing Xuanming still hesitating, Elder Xiang pressed on, “Senior Brother Sect Leader, we must prioritize matters by their significance and circumstances. Guan Yu’s affairs aren’t urgent. If we miss this crucial opportunity to seize the Eight-Drum Technique and let the Demon Soul Sect acquire it, the consequences could be disastrous.”

“Furthermore,” Elder Xiang added, “Guan Yu’s current projects can be temporarily postponed. We could have him impart all his knowledge now, enabling us to produce independently in the future. Otherwise, we’ll remain perpetually dependent on him.”

Xuanming nodded, “Your reasoning is sound. We’ll proceed as you suggest. The Eight-Drum Technique takes precedence. We can resume production after retrieving it.”

A sly smile crept across Elder Xiang’s face, though Xuanming knew matters weren’t so simple. Guan Yu wasn’t someone who obeyed blindly – whether he’d agree to venture into the desert to find Miao Cheng remained uncertain.

Anticipating further negotiations, Xuanming summoned Guan Yu after finalizing his decision.

Guan Yu was deep in research with Wang Jun on enhancing the hand crossbow’s power when Elder Wang returned with a grim expression.

They had been examining the mysterious Black Ironstone – a substance resembling both iron and stone with magnetic properties. Despite its stony appearance, it proved fire-resistant yet displayed unexpected flexibility when infused with inner energy.

Recognizing Elder Wang’s failed attempt to obtain the ironstone from Xuanming, Guan Yu seized this opportunity to build alliances. “Elder Wang, please accompany me,” he said, leading the elder to his quarters where Wang Jun waited.

With a smile, Guan Yu presented a palm-sized fragment of Black Ironstone. “Please accept this humble gift. Consider it a token of my appreciation.”

Elder Wang’s hands trembled as he received it. “This... I’m deeply grateful! Our entire Zhenyang Sect possesses only a dice-sized piece embedded in our leader’s spiritual tool. To receive this...”

“Think nothing of it,” Guan Yu replied. “I may require your expertise in future endeavors. For instance,” he gestured to miniature crossbow components on the table, “what improvements would you suggest?”

Elder Wang marveled at the intricate designs. “These components are remarkably compact! But the materials seem different...”

“A special alloy we developed,” Wang Jun explained, revealing their process of blending melted armor plating with brass for enhanced durability and flexibility.

Their technical discussion was interrupted by a disciple summoning Guan Yu to the main hall. “The Sect Leader requests your presence immediately.”

Alone with Wang Jun, Guan Yu speculated, “Xuanming likely wants the Black Ironstone. But I won’t surrender it easily – not without conditions.”

As predicted, Xuanming’s greeting concealed ulterior motives. “Your crossbow progress?” he inquired casually before circling to the true agenda. “The Black Ironstone... such precious material shouldn’t be squandered on mere weapons. Our sect could equip countless disciples with superior spiritual tools!”

Guan Yu remained unmoved. “The ironstone was my acquisition for crossbow development. I assure you, no waste will occur.”

Growing impatient, Xuanming shifted tactics. “The Eight-Drum Mission takes priority. You must depart for the desert soon.”

“I’ll go,” Guan Yu conceded, “but on two conditions: Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi accompany me. And you ensure Elder Xiang honors his bet – fifty years of cultivation to cure Xiao Zhi’s blood toxin.”

Placing a Black Ironstone fragment before Xuanming, Guan Yu concluded, “This is yours... provided you persuade Elder Xiang.” The unspoken threat hung clear – no compliance, no ironstone.
