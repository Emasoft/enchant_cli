When it was time for lunch, Guanyu stretched lazily and stood up. “My stomach’s growling. Let’s grab a meal.”

Wang Zhen and Tian Hao readily agreed.

Just then, Guanyu’s phone buzzed in his pocket with a new message: “At the school gate. Waiting for you.”

Guanyu stared at the text for a full half-minute before murmuring to himself, “Why has she come to N City?”

**Chapter 527: Negotiations (Part 1)**

“Who’s here?” Wang Zhen couldn’t resist asking as Guanyu fixated on his phone screen.

“Oh, just a friend,” Guanyu replied, slipping his phone back into his pocket with an apologetic smile. “Something’s come up—I might have to skip lunch with you guys today. Let’s meet tonight instead.”

Whatever had interrupted their brotherly meal must be important—and the faintly roguish smile tugging at Guanyu’s lips told Wang Zhen through masculine intuition that the texter was undoubtedly a woman.

“Go handle your business. We can eat anytime,” Tian Hao said dismissively, oblivious to Wang Zhen’s speculations.

“Boss, take me with you!” Wang Zhen pleaded pitifully.

Tian Hao felt Wang Zhen’s very existence shamed him. Without mercy, he flicked Wang Zhen’s forehead. “The boss has matters to attend. Why would he drag you along?”

Rubbing his sore head, Wang Zhen shot Tian Hao a scornful look. “He’s obviously meeting a woman—probably romancing her! I’m determined to follow the boss and learn his seduction techniques. That’s why I need to go!”

“Hey, Boss! Don’t walk so fast! Just take me—” Wang Zhen shouted as Guanyu vanished from sight, scrambling after him.

Guanyu marveled at Wang Zhen’s sudden perceptiveness. How had the guy deduced from mere facial expressions that he was meeting a woman? Such talent shouldn’t be wasted—it deserved nurturing. History would later prove Wang Zhen indispensable, becoming Guanyu’s right-hand man in the empire he built.

At the school gate, Guanyu spotted Li Xi instantly.

It wasn’t due to sparse foot traffic—Li Xi simply commanded every gaze. Her presence guaranteed 100% head-turning.

Clad in a white trench coat and knee-high boots, an Hermès scarf draped around her neck, she stood with hair cascading over her shoulders. Her lightly made-up face featured arched brows, luminous eyes, and glossy lips. Though her eyelids drooped slightly, ignoring all onlookers, her quiet aura radiated icy detachment.

Among the crowd, she resembled an ethereal goddess untouched by mortal cares—the perfect idol in every otaku’s heart.

Guanyu couldn’t help an amused smile. How familiar this felt. He clicked his tongue—one goddess had just departed, only for another to arrive.

Approaching her, he said warmly, “Your visit is... unexpected.”

Li Xi lifted her gaze, offering no polite smile. “I’m here to discuss partnership matters.”

Guanyu’s eyes widened in realization before turning mischievous. “Even for business, did it require your personal presence?”

“I have another project to negotiate in N City,” Li Xi replied, reading his unspoken question.

“I didn’t ask for reasons,” Guanyu chuckled.

Silence.

Sniffing the air, Guanyu grinned. “We can’t talk here. Where to? I haven’t eaten—perfect timing for you to treat me.”

Without responding, Li Xi turned and entered a nearby car. Guanyu shrugged and slid into the passenger seat.

As the vehicle drove off, Wang Zhen and Tian Hao stood dumbstruck at the gate.

“Did you see that? The boss got into that goddess’ car!” Wang Zhen gasped.

Tian Hao gulped, eyes glued to the departing taillights. “No wonder he wouldn’t spare us a crumb—he’s annihilating all competition! The world’s too cruel...” Wang Zhen lamented theatrically.

“How many hidden women does the boss have?” Tian Hao wondered aloud.

Wang Zhen’s eyes suddenly sparkled with renewed vigor.

**Chapter 528: Negotiations (Part 2)**

Li Xi parked at a five-star hotel, tossing her keys to a valet before striding inside. Guanyu followed, remarking, “Seems excessive for a casual meal.”

She shot him a silent glance. He zipped his lips—after all, he wasn’t paying.

The private suite resembled a conference room. Guanyu sprawled unceremoniously on a sofa while Li Xi sat primly across him, retrieving documents from her bag. “Our assessment and proposal for the portable energy device you suggested. Review them.”

Guanyu ignored the thick dossier. “You handle this. I’ll manage military relations—the rest is yours.”

Surprise flickered in Li Xi’s eyes before her composure returned.

The silence grew brittle.

“Expecting others?” Guanyu suddenly asked.

Li Xi nodded. “This is where I’ll meet my other project’s negotiator.”

Guanyu studied her playfully. “Involving me?”

“No relation.”

“Then why?” His gaze intensified.

“My father’s instruction.” Her tone carried faint discomfort.

Li Yuanshan’s doing? Guanyu’s eyes narrowed. The implication was clear—the patriarch might be matchmaking or grooming him as successor.

Rolling his eyes internally, Guanyu marveled at Li Yuanshan’s audacity—pushing his daughter toward a man already entangled with other women. Not that he’d refuse someone like Li Xi... if she consented.

“Troublesome negotiation?” Guanyu deflected awkwardly.

“A business summit,” Li Xi corrected, swirling her wine.

“Who holds leverage?”

“I do.”

“Your strategy?”

“No concessions. They want my flesh? Impossible.” Her sudden ferocity startled Guanyu—less goddess, more queen.

Unwittingly, he’d been drawn into the vortex.

**Chapter 529: Two Against One**

Amidst beauty and wine, Guanyu eyed both thirstily. When Li Xi didn’t pour for him, he helped himself, draining a glass in one gulp.

“Who’s our opponent?”

“Wan Qianshan. Chairman of Wanfeng Group. Rose from the underworld. Still operates shadows beneath legitimate ventures. Rapid wealth accumulation.”

Guanyu frowned. “Why engage such people?”

“What kind of person is Feng Xin?” Li Xi countered.

Guanyu hesitated. “She’s different—earns clean money.”

“Truly?” Li Xi’s arched brow challenged him.

Before he could respond, the door burst open.

A square-jawed man entered—Wan Qianshan, exuding authority. Three alert bodyguards scanned the room, hands edging toward concealed weapons during their stare-down with Guanyu.

Wan Qianshan’s displeasure grew at Guanyu’s lack of deference. “I dislike outsiders during negotiations.”

“He’s not an outsider,” Li Xi stated coolly.

“Remove him,” Wan Qianshan commanded. A bodyguard lunged at Guanyu.

The confrontation erupted instantly—forearm met shin in a bone-jarring collision. The guard staggered back, leg trembling. Guanyu smirked, adrenaline surging. This “goddess’s” negotiation had just turned primal.
