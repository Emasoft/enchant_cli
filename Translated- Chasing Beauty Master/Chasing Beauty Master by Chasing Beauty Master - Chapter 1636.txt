“Hmm…” The Emperor stroked his slightly whitened beard and said, “I never said I blamed you. Why are you so afraid? However, the First Prince speaks truth. You must know your place. Matters within your jurisdiction cannot be neglected, while affairs beyond your authority should not be meddled with.”

Upon hearing the Emperor’s words, the Second Prince stiffened in shock, as did the officials behind him. The Emperor’s remarks unmistakably favored the First Prince, hinting at a seismic shift in the court’s balance of power that had endured for years.

“Understood, Imperial Father,” the Second Prince replied through gritted teeth. Regardless of the Emperor’s intentions or the fairness of his words, direct contradiction was unthinkable. The Second Prince could only swallow his resentment.

The Emperor nodded. “Rise.”

Turning to the First Prince, the ruler inquired, “Why have you brought this object to court today? Do you have matters to present?” His gaze flickered meaningfully toward the Second Prince as he spoke, as though privy to the box’s contents.

“Imperial Father,” the First Prince bowed, “this contains evidence discovered after Magistrate Zhang’s death in Bajia City. As you commanded me to investigate both the conflagration at the magistrate’s residence and the circumstances of Zhang’s demise—I now present conclusive findings.”

“So swiftly?” The Emperor’s eyes lit with approval. “Your efficiency exceeds ordinary men’s capabilities.”

The Second Prince’s complexion darkened. “First Prince, could this ‘evidence’ be prearranged to frame others? Such rapid conclusions reek of fabrication!”

“Truth requires no defense,” the First Prince countered calmly. “Neither your accusations nor my claims hold weight until verified by His Majesty.” He set the lacquered box upon the marble floor, lifting its lid with deliberate ceremony.

Courtiers craned their necks, the Emperor himself rising from his dragon throne for better vantage. Within lay a charred human skull, its hollow sockets staring blankly upward.

“This is Magistrate Zhang’s skull,” the First Prince announced. “The magistrate’s residence was doused with fire oil before being torched. Observe the arrowhead embedded here.” He extracted a corroded projectile from the cranium. “The character ‘禁’ (Imperial Guard) is etched upon it.”

A susurrus swept through the hall like autumn leaves. Every official recognized the emblem—this arrow belonged to the Imperial Guards. Chancellor Li paled, sensing impending disaster.

“Within the ruins,” the First Prince continued, “we discovered this skull alongside Magistrate Zhang’s jade thumb ring, identified by his household. Two maidservants present during the attack have given testimony.”

“Preposterous!” The Second Prince interjected. “If Zhang perished in flames, how came an Imperial Guard’s arrow in his skull? This reeks of staged evidence to slander the Guards!”

The Emperor stroked his beard thoughtfully. “The Second Prince raises valid concerns. Fire victims seldom bear arrow wounds.”

“Initially, I shared such doubts,” the First Prince conceded. “But evidence shows Magistrate Zhang was slain before the fire began. This arrow killed him instantly. The blaze merely concealed the murder.”

Chancellor Li shrunk behind his court tablet, silently pleading for the Second Prince’s intervention.

“Fairy tales!” The Second Prince scoffed. “A skull and trinkets prove nothing! With Zhang dead, you spin whatever fancies suit your—”

“Hear the witnesses,” the First Prince interrupted. “That day, over a hundred Imperial Guards stormed the residence during Magistrate Zhang’s meeting with Prince Zou. After dousing the hall with oil, they demanded Prince Zou’s surrender. When Zhang protested, they silenced him permanently.” He gestured to the skull. “Two surviving maidservants witnessed everything.”

The Second Prince’s face drained of color. Witnesses changed everything.

**Chapter 4268: The Remaining Evidence (Part 2)**

With credible witnesses, the situation grew perilously complex. Should these maidservants testify before the Emperor, Chancellor Li’s fate—and perhaps the Second Prince’s—would hang by a thread.

“Where are these witnesses?” The Emperor demanded.

“Awaiting outside the Golden Chariot Hall,” the First Prince replied. “As a second-rank official’s murder terrifies Bajia City’s populace, only public testimony before the full court can restore confidence.”

The Emperor hesitated. Commoners in the sacred court? Unprecedented.

Eunuch Yu, observing his master’s conflict, whispered, “Your Majesty, refusing the witnesses might fuel baseless speculation. Receiving them demonstrates imperial justice.”

After prolonged silence, the Emperor nodded. “Summon them.”

“Imperial Father, this violates protocol!” The Second Prince protested. “How can lowborn maids pollute this hall?”

His glare at the courtiers triggered a chorus of agreement. “Unseemly!” “Against tradition!” Ministers chorused, though Chancellor Li remained conspicuously silent.

The First Prince raised his voice above the din. “When second-rank officials are slain, shall we quibble over witnesses’ status? Those who dare murder imperial officers show greater disrespect than any ‘polluting’ commoner!”

His words fell on deaf ears. To the court, the First Prince remained the ineffectual eldest son—loud voice notwithstanding.

The Second Prince smirked. “Clearly, you seek to frame the Imperial Guards and implicate Chancellor Li. Zhang died accidentally! Your incompetence shames the imperial trust!”

Gasps rippled through the hall. Never had royal brothers clashed so openly.

The Emperor observed keenly from his throne. This confrontation pleased him—a counterbalance to the Second Prince’s swelling influence.

“Your concern for Chancellor Li is touching,” the First Prince retorted. “Since when do you champion the Imperial Guards’ commander? The Emperor detests factionalism. What does your zeal suggest?”

“Slanderer!” The Second Prince spat. “I uphold imperial dignity! This hall—”

“Which His Majesty has already opened to witnesses,” the First Prince finished. “Do you oppose the Emperor’s will?”

As the princes quarreled, the Emperor hid a smile. Let them battle. A balanced court served his rule better than single dominance.

When the Second Prince finally appealed to him, the ruler feigned indecision. “First Prince, have you already examined these witnesses?”

“Thoroughly, Imperial Father. Their accounts match physical evidence. The entire magistrate’s household confirms the Guards’ presence.”

The Emperor turned. “Second Prince? Have you counterarguments?”

The younger prince lowered his head. “The Imperial Guards are elite troops. Why murder an official?”

“Do you presume to know my armies better than I?” The Emperor’s quiet question froze the hall.

Trembling, the Second Prince kowtowed. “Never, Imperial Father!”

“Enough.” The Emperor rose. “First Prince, you will oversee this investigation. Chancellor Li—” His gaze pierced the quaking minister. “Reflect carefully on your actions.”

**Chapter 4269: Reap What You Sow**

As the court dispersed, the Second Prince and Chancellor Li wore expressions of men attending their own funerals. The First Prince remained vigilantly guarding his witnesses—knowing well what desperate men might attempt.
