Guan Yu slowly pushed the saw blade forward with rapid speed, unlike the cautious stone-cutting master who kept shining a flashlight into the cutting gap to check for jadeite. Yet Guan Yu knew exactly how this angle would reveal the stone's secrets.

In mere seconds after splitting the rough stone, before Guan Yu could even step forward to inspect it, the crowd erupted: “It’s rising! The gamble paid off! There’s green!”

“Holy shit! We’ve won! Green!”

The onlookers buzzed with more excitement than Guan Yu himself. Witnessing jade emerge from raw stone, these thrill-seekers rubbed their hands eagerly, faces alight with vicarious triumph.

“It really came out! Haha…” Guan Yu laughed heartily, rushing to lift the split stone. Wiping away dust and water, he revealed the green-speckled cross-section.

“Spotted jadeite—not bad at all, young man! This stone’s worth at least 100,000 yuan. Fine cutting technique too! Impressive!” The stone master praised repeatedly.

“Technique? Just luck. Don’t flatter me. 100,000? But we haven’t fully cut it yet?” Guan Yu asked, puzzled.

“Ah, this valuation is based on the current exposed area. If the green thickens inside, the price soars. If it thins… well.” The master patiently explained.

So the gamble continued with each cut—a cascade of choices and risks. No wonder stone gambling drove tycoons to obsession.

“I see… Let’s make two more cuts!” Guan Yu moved to reposition the stone.

“Young man, I’ll buy it! 110,000 yuan!” A suited middle-aged man interjected urgently, eyes gleaming. A partially revealed gamble felt safer, apparently.

“110,000?” Guan Yu blinked. Actual offers already?

“I don’t know pricing.” He glanced sideways at the stone master.

“Fair offer. Your call. If the green runs three centimeters deep, it’s 150,000. Five centimeters? 300,000.”

Guan Yu nodded thoughtfully. His ignorance of jade valuation didn’t matter—his detection skill revealed the buyer’s sincerity. Probing the stone, he confirmed the green band matched the description: three centimeters wide, no hidden surprises.

“Deal. 110,000 it is.”

Half an hour later, Guan Yu exited the jewelry mall with Du Xiaojuan and Niu Le, the buyer’s modest profit irrelevant next to his epiphany: his detection skill could dominate this arena.

Fortune awaited.

**Chapter 189: Sleeping with Toes Clutched**

Elated, Guan Yu planned their imminent trip to Yunnan’s stone markets with Niu Le. The latter babbled about future riches, oblivious to risks, while Du Xiaojuan—naive and guileless—asked no questions about Guan Yu’s uncanny winning streak.

“But… Senior, without ID, you can’t fly. Border checks in Yunnan are strict,” Guan Yu fretted on their sofa.

Du Xiaojuan’s face fell. Abandoned again?

“What… what should I do?” She pouted miserably, stirring even Niu Le’s thick-skinned sympathy.

“Stay here alone?” Guan Yu grimaced. The absent-minded girl losing keys or being swindled haunted him.

“Ask Sister Feng to watch you?”

“That woman? No… She dislikes me.” Du Xiaojuan shrunk, recalling Feng Xin’s icy scrutiny.

Inspiration struck: “Mother Luo! Help her with the orphanage kids.”

Du Xiaojuan brightened. Crisis solved.

“Book flights! We leave tomorrow!” Guan Yu declared.

“So soon?” Du Xiaojuan’s brief joy dissolved into hollow unease.

“Quick trip,” Guan Yu patted her head.

That night, Du Xiaojuan sulked on the bed edge in pink slippers, silent for hours.

“Senior, time to sleep.” Guan Yu emerged from the bathroom, droplets flicking from his hands.

“Mmm…” Her pout could “hang a soy sauce bottle,” eyes pooling with melancholy.

“Just a few days,” he coaxed. Her entire world hinged on him since fleeing home—this separation terrified her.

“This trip’s for you. If I strike rich, your family will accept me… and us being friends.”

“Oh!” She perked up. “Then… will Daddy let me marry you?”

Guan Yu choked. Marriage? At twenty?

“It’s about changing their perception, not selling you,” he deflected.

Later, as Du Xiaojuan toddled off to wash, she paused: “Wait… why did I get up again?”

Guan Yu facepalmed. This airheaded girl forgot mid-step—her endearing, exasperating trademark.

**Chapter 190: Little Space Cadet**

The Bone-Breaking Fist’s intricacies still eluded full deployment, but Guan Yu practiced daily. With gravity manipulation enhancing speed and power, even a three-hit combo could floor a boxing champion.

He rose early to drill moves, avoiding mornings when Du Xiaojuan clung to his thigh mistaking it for a pillow. Her belief in cuddling his shoulder amused him—truth was, he slept clutching her silken feet to curb… impulses.

“You’ll really hold me every night?” she’d asked earlier, eyes starry.

“If you want.”

“Forever?”

Guan Yu hedged. At least she’d stopped pouting.

Now, as she stood confused in the hallway, he sighed: “Washing your feet, remember?”

“Oh! Right!” She skipped away, blissfully oblivious—a little迷糊 (míhú, space cadet) forever orbiting her own reality.
