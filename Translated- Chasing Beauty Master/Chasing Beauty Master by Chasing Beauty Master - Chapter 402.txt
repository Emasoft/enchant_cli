Beside Li Xi stood Song Qifeng, who had also witnessed the earlier scene. His contempt for Guan Yu deepened further.

“That punk’s a complete scoundrel! Xiaoxi, how did you ever get acquainted with him?”

*A scoundrel?* That was an understatement—the guy was utterly shameless!

Of course, Li Xi would never voice this aloud.

Nearby, Jiang Ziqi watched with an amused smirk, muttering, “That guy really can’t stay out of trouble anywhere he goes!”

“Young Master Jiang, did you really become his lackey?”

Seated beside Jiang Ziqi were several young men of similar age and social standing. They had all heard about Jiang Ziqis public support for Guan Yu and couldn’t fathom why someone as prideful as him would willingly serve as Guan Yus subordinate.

Jiang Ziqi didn’t deny it, replying coolly, “Have you all made your decisions?”

“I still need more time to consider,” said one.

“I don’t have authority over family matters,” another added.

The remaining three remained silent, but their expressions mirrored the others’ reluctance. None were willing to align themselves with Guan Yu.

Jiang Ziqi wasn’t surprised by their reactions—this outcome was expected. Internally, he sneered.

During his afternoon conversation with his father, he had ultimately decided to gamble: betting that Guan Yu would emerge unscathed from this ordeal and that the Song family couldn’t touch him. To demonstrate sincerity, he had tried rallying these close associates. But as anticipated, none would risk their families’ interests for Guan Yu.

Yet Jiang Ziqi didn’t mind. Their refusal suited him perfectly.

*Timely aid during hardship always outweighs superficial flattery.* Once Guan Yu weathered this storm, these fools would weep with regret.

For every friend Guan Yu had, there were enemies.

Despite the agonizing swelling in his groin from earlier injuries, Li Bing had forced himself to attend, determined to witness Guan Yus destruction at the Songs’ hands.

“Damn it, Guan Yu! Once the Young Master Song crushes you, I’ll drag that bitch by your side to be my personal slave!”

Though uncertain whether Guan Yu had directly caused his condition, Li Bing knew the bastard was responsible.

In another corner, Young Master Li and Li Yu secretly observed Guan Yu. The latter particularly burned with hatred, willing the Song family to appear and haul Guan Yu away immediately—he couldn’t endure another minute of the upstart’s arrogance.

Nearly everyone in the venue awaited the Songs’ arrival, speculating how the family would punish this challenger. Yet disappointment set in when no Song members appeared, not even heir Song Shaoqin, as the ball commenced.

The event unfolded on the second floor, now crowded with impeccably dressed socialites and scions. Though individually striking, their collective presence dulled any standout appeal—until Wen Qing and Guan Yu ascended.

The pair’s entrance immediately drew attention.

Guan Yu, already the center of scrutiny, now captivated onlookers with his chiseled features, athletic build, and aura of unshakable composure. Whispers rippled through the crowd.

Men smirked coldly, anticipating Guan Yus downfall while plotting how to pursue Wen Qing afterward. Women sighed regretfully—such a charismatic man doomed by provoking the Songs.

“Xiaoqing, may I have this dance?” Hu Zongze appeared.

Undeniably handsome with a tall frame, refined manners, and noble bearing, Hu possessed charm that would make most women swoon. Yet Wen Qing felt nothing special for him.

“Apologies, Brother Zongze,” she declined gently. “I promised Guan Yu this dance.” Turning to her companion, she chirped, “Darling, let’s dance!”

Guan Yu feigned melancholy. “Sweetheart, aren’t you foolish? I’m neither handsome nor as wealthy and powerful as your Brother Zongze. Why ever choose me?”

Wen Qing giggled melodically. “How true! Maybe my eyesight’s faulty. I should reconsider!”

*Smack!* Guan Yu playfully swatted her perky bottom. “Dare you!”

“Ow!” She pouted tearfully.

“Hurts? Let me massage it better.” His leer couldn’t have been more roguish.

“You villain!” Laughing, she darted onto the dance floor.

Their shameless flirting enraged Hu Zongze. Watching Wen Qing’s alluring figure, he seethed: *Since you scorn me, Wen Qing, don’t blame what comes! Once Guan Yu falls, I’ll make you experience true power.*

“Darling, can’t you dance?”

Wen Qing had assumed Guan Yu’s boasts of versatility included ballroom skills. Dragged onto the floor, she discovered how wrong she’d been—he utterly lacked social dance ability.

“This snail-paced swaying? Not my style,” Guan Yu scoffed, preferring vigorous movements over languid steps.

“Even if inexperienced, must you keep trampling my feet? They’re sore!”

**Chapter 1007: Another Casualty**

Since entering the dancefloor, Guan Yu had stepped on her feet thrice. Only his quick reflexes—lightening his tread upon contact—spared her from bruising.

“Maybe we should stop,” he suggested awkwardly. “I’m hopeless at this.”

“After this song,” Wen Qing insisted, noting surrounding frowns.

As the DJ transitioned to livelier music, Guan Yu noticed five-six dancers encircling them, gradually closing in.

*Someone wants me humiliated.*

Sure enough, soon someone tripped him. In the dim lighting, Guan Yu couldn’t identify the culprit but sensed deliberate malice.

Feigning ignorance, he shifted gravitational force to his foot and slammed downward. *Crack!* A bone snapped audibly before agonized screams erupted—a horse-faced young man collapsed, clutching his mangled foot.

“Young Master Ma! What happened?” Concerned voices surrounded him.

Hu Zongze approached demanding answers.

“Him!” Ma pointed venomously at Guan Yu. “He broke my foot!” Like others present, Ma had sought to curry favor with the Songs by harassing Guan Yu. But when his tripping foot met Guan Yu’s, it felt like striking iron—the recoil shattered bones.

“Your doing, Guan Yu?” Hu Zongze glared, sensing an opportunity.

Guan Yu eyed him like an idiot. “His word against mine? Why would I break his foot? Are my soles made of steel?”

Hu faltered—the argument held merit. In poor lighting, proving intent was impossible.

“Young Master Ma,” Guan Yu pressed, “why trip me?”

“N-no!” Ma stammered.

“No? Then how’d your foot break? Explain!” Guan Yu roared, startling Ma into confession: “It broke when I tripped you!”

Instantly regretting his admission, Ma paled.

Guan Yu snorted at Hu Zongze. “As club president, how will you handle this?”

Frowning, Hu deflected: “Young Master Ma might’ve acted accidentally. Surely you won’t nitpick over trifles?”

*Bastard’s calling me petty?* Guan Yu seethed internally but maintained composure. “If everyone ‘accidentally’ trips me, I’ll be floorbound! We all know the truth. Handle it or not—you’re the boss.”

Security Captain Zhang arrived. Knowing he must act, Hu ordered: “Escort Young Master Ma to hospital. Membership matters will follow.”

Guan Yu sneered—he knew Hu would later dismiss the incident. Regardless, the public lesson sufficed. A minor figure like Ma wasn’t worth his attention.

“Guan Yu,” Hu warned, “cause more trouble, and I’ll expel you.”

Guan Yu smiled faintly. “You’ll get no chance.”

……

Subsequently, though hostility lingered, none dared provoke Guan Yu. Bored, he embraced Wen Qing’s slender waist. “Let’s leave, love. This place stifles.”

Equally disinterested—having rejected Hu Zongze’s repeated advances—Wen Qing agreed. As they prepared to depart, Hu reappeared, inviting them to a charity auction.

“What’s this auction?” Guan Yu asked. Though familiar with charity events, he hadn’t expected this club’s version.

Lin Lin explained, “Probably another vanity project. These days, high-end establishments flaunt philanthropy. They auction trinkets to the rich, claiming proceeds go to charity—though most line private pockets.”

Uninterested in such pretenses, Guan Yu nearly declined. But Wen Qing, never having attended an auction, pleaded to stay. Relenting, he accompanied her.

This year’s event differed—rumors cited priceless antiques and artworks. Led to the third-floor auction hall, Guan Yu noted Hu Zongze’s calculating gaze from the podium.

*Whatever trap he’s set, bring it on.*

**Chapter 1008: The Eternal Heart**

Hu Zongze’s lips curled as Guan Yu entered. “Everything prepared?”

“All arranged.”

“Good.” Hu smirked inwardly. *This auction’s specially crafted for you, Guan Yu. Don’t waste my efforts.*

To Guan Yu, the auction proved insufferably dull. Bidders frenzied over mediocre items—a Republic-era painting fetched millions; Puyi’s chamber pot sold for tens of millions.

“Should we rob these idiots?” he whispered to Lin Dong. “Their cash reeks of corruption.”

Lin Dong shared his disdain. Not a single lot impressed them. Were the attendees not filthy rich, he’d suspect the club of outright fraud.

“Let’s go,” Guan Yu urged as Wen Qing yawned.

They rose to leave when Wen Qing suddenly gasped, clutching his arm excitedly. “The Eternal Heart! It’s the Eternal Heart!”

Following her gaze, Guan Yu saw the auctioneer presenting a glass case containing a heart-shaped white jade. Its perfection stunned him—every angle showed flawless symmetry, lacking any tool marks. This gem appeared either divinely crafted or shaped by peerless artisans.

“So it truly exists…” Lin Dong murmured awestruck, while Lin Lin’s eyes sparkled.

“What’s the Eternal Heart?” Though dealing in jade, Guan Yu hadn’t encountered this legend.

Lin Lin clasped her hands dreamily. “A Ming Dynasty tale—a master carver commissioned to create imperial seals discovered his jade was stolen from a dying woman’s husband. Though initially indifferent, learning of the couple’s tragic love moved him. Defying the emperor, he secretly carved the jade into this heart, symbolizing eternal devotion. It vanished after his execution…until now.”
