Qing Ling’er never expected her father to still be alive. Overwhelmed with emotion, she rushed forward with outstretched arms to embrace Wu Shifu (Martial Master). Though they hadn’t met for over a decade, the bond of flesh and blood could not be mistaken—father and daughter recognized each other instantly.

Guan Yu swiftly intercepted her movement. Qing Ling’er stared at him in confusion, unsure of his intent. Meeting her anxious gaze, Guan Yu explained gently, “Wu Shifu’s body is saturated with potent venom that has already reached his heart. You mustn’t approach him, or you’ll be endangered.”

“I’m not afraid…” Qing Ling’er’s voice trembled with urgency. All she desired was to hold her long-lost father. She struggled fiercely against Guan Yu’s unyielding grip.

Seeing this, Wu Shifu acknowledged Guan Yu’s warning. The snake venom coursing through him was virulent and highly contagious. “Ling’er,” he rasped, “listen to Guan Yu. Be patient.”

Qing Ling’er finally relented, collapsing into Guan Yu’s arms with anguished sobs. “Father… who did this to you? Who could be so cruel…?”

Guan Yu patted her back soothingly. After a pause, he confessed, “Ling’er… there’s something you should know. I… was the one who injured your father. I didn’t know his identity then.”

Qing Ling’er jerked her head up, her gaze piercing yet conflicted. A torrent of unspoken words swirled in her heart as her eyes brimmed with reproach.

Torn between her long-lost father and the man who had saved her life repeatedly, she stood paralyzed. How could she reconcile that her beloved Guan Yu had inflicted such harm?

Hou Jinshun, sensing her turmoil, stepped forward. “Ling’er, we didn’t recognize your father initially. He was conspiring with others against Guan Yu. Only afterward did we learn his true identity. You know Guan Yu’s character—there’s no malice here.”

Wu Shifu coughed blood, his voice feeble. “He speaks truth. The fault was mine. Guan Yu’s strike… though severe… forced the venomous blood from my system. It… inadvertently lessened the poison’s hold.”

This was a white lie to absolve Guan Yu. In reality, the venom had already seized his heart. His only wish now was for Guan Yu to protect his daughter.

Qing Ling’er’s tension eased slightly at her father’s words. “Forgive me, Brother Guan… I misunderstood you.”

“The blame is shared,” Guan Yu replied humbly.

“Please,” Qing Ling’er begged, tears glistening, “save my father. I know you can find a way.” Her vulnerable plea struck him deeply, stirring an urge to comfort her.

Yet Guan Yu felt powerless. The decade-old venom defied even Wu Shifu’s formidable skills. Only a Jiezun Relic might offer hope—a near-impossible acquisition.

“I’ll find a solution,” Guan Yu vowed, prioritizing her calm.

Qing Ling’er turned to Hou Jinshun. “Manager Hou, please inform Miss Yang I’ll be absent to care for my father.”

“Consider it done,” Hou nodded. Guan Yu added, “Disclose nothing about Wu Shifu’s presence. Tell Conghan Ling’er’s mother is gravely ill in the countryside.”

After Hou’s departure, Guan Yu assisted Qing Ling’er in settling her father, Qing Guanghui (Radiant Glory)—the true name behind “Wu Shifu.” He warned her to avoid close contact and maintain ventilation against the venom.

That night, as Qing Ling’er and Guan Yu sat conversing, she suddenly teased, “Brother Guan, how dare you bring women to my room? And on the sofa too… how shameless!”

Guan Yu flushed, recalling Jin Hua’s bloodstains. “Nonsense! That was… a nosebleed,” he stammered.

“A nosebleed?” She arched an eyebrow. “I’m a doctor. Do you think I can’t distinguish blood types?”

Cornered, Guan Yu fell silent.

“With so many women,” she prodded mischievously, “how do you manage? A dozen inside and out—can your stamina keep up?”

“Nowhere near that number!” Guan Yu protested, though mentally tallying Xue Jing, Amei, Zhang Han, Yang Conghan…

“Eight at least,” she countered.

“Including you, exactly eight,” he joked lewdly.

“You’re terrible!” She playfully swatted his shoulder.

Later, returning to his villa, Guan Yu found Zhang Han asleep in his bed. After a sleepless night pondering complexities, dawn brought renewed passions. Their vigorous coupling drew complaints from Xue Jing downstairs: “That wretched man! Back at dawn and already making noise—louder than any alarm clock!”

“I’ll hire craftsmen for soundproofing,” Xue Jing fumed. “Let them scream themselves hoarse without disturbing us!”

Amei silently agreed, recalling her own stifled moans. Better soundproofing would grant freedom to vocalize pleasures.

At breakfast, Zhang Han’s unsteady gait drew scolding. “You brute!” Xue Jing chided Guan Yu. “She’s too young for such rough treatment!”

Zhang Han, unrepentant, chirped, “Don’t blame Uncle Guan! I loved every moment. Let’s go wilder tonight!”

Guan Yu, choking on his food, mumbled about moderation.

Later, at school, Guan Yu warned allies Wei Hongwei and Jia Bo of looming threats before visiting Qing Guanghui. The old man confirmed fragmentary memories of the Zhang family’s past conflicts but no knowledge of hidden treasures.

As dusk fell, Guan Yu shared drinks with Pan Taisheng, their camaraderie easing tensions. Yet beneath the laughter, storms brewed—clandestine plots, unresolved romances, and the ever-looming specter of venomous fate.
