After breakfast that morning, Wen Qing dragged Guan Yu to the International Trade Center. With the evening's ball approaching, Guan Yu lacked proper formal attire, prompting this shopping expedition.

As they passed a Breguet boutique, Guan Yu suddenly realized he'd never properly gifted his women. He guided Wen Qing inside.

"Wow, hubby! These watches are gorgeous!" Though born to privilege, Wen Qing's special status necessitated modest attire. The sudden immersion in luxury made her bounce excitedly around the display cases.

Guan Yu smiled indulgently. If Xiaoqing liked these, perhaps Feng Xin and others would too. "Pick whichever you fancy, wifey. My treat!"

"Really? But these start at tens of thousands!" Wen Qing bit her lip, eyeing price tags ranging from millions to hundreds of thousands.

"Money's meant for spoiling you." Guan Yu shrugged. Frugal with himself, he spared no expense for his wives.

"Thank you, darling!" She planted a kiss on his cheek.

The salesclerk watched enviously. "You're fortunate, miss. Let me recommend this couple's set - 'Eternal Love', our latest release." She produced twin ivory watches with jade bodies crusted in diamonds, platinum hands gleaming under lights. Tiny porcelain dolls within kissed at every noon.

Wen Qing clung to them like treasure.

Just as Guan Yu prepared to purchase, a manicured hand snatched the watches. A saccharine voice cooed: "Hubby~ These are perfect! Buy them for me?"

Guan Yu turned to see an odd couple - the woman's exposed cleavage grinding against a short, pot-bellied bald man resembling a pregnant walrus. Classic sugar daddy and mistress.

"Take them," the秃头grunted without glancing at prices.

"How much?" the mistress demanded.

"One million RMB," the clerk answered, shooting Guan Yu an apologetic look.

"WHAT? Yen?!" The秃头staggered.

"RMB, sir." The clerk's disdain grew. A fake nouveau riche.

"Gold-plated or what?!"

"Solid jade with diamond inlay, sir. Breguet's signature craftsmanship..."

The mistress purred against her patron: "It's pocket change for you. Imagine how this would showcase your status..."

秃头swallowed hard. "Wrap them!"

The clerk hesitated, noticing Guan Yu's interest. "But these are our last pair—"

"DO IT! Or I'll get you fired!"

Chapter 997: Watch Dispute

"Let them have it," Guan Yu sneered. "My wife disdains touched goods."

秃头noticed Wen Qing and leered: "Miss! I'm Song Daming, CEO of Cosmic Entertainment. Here's my card. Ever considered acting?"

Wen Qing retreated behind Guan Yu.

"Remove your hand," Guan Yu said icily.

Song Daming puffed his chest at Guan Yu's student-like attire. "Young man! You're hindering this goddess' future! Break up before you ruin her!"

Guan Yu raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Sign with me, and this watch's yours!" Song Daming ogled Wen Qing. "Your boy-toy can't afford this."

Wen Qing blinked innocently. "Could you make me famous?"

"Absolutely! We work with top directors! Hollywood connections!" Song Daming lied through gold-capped teeth about his shell company.

After feigned deliberation, Wen Qing chirped: "Buy the watch, and I'll consider it!"

As Song Daming triumphantly paid, the clerk pitied Guan Yu - apparently being cuckolded. Guan Yu merely shrugged at his mischievous lover's antics.

"Now come!" Song Daming reached for Wen Qing.

"After you gift it," she demurred. Once the box was hers, she clasped Guan Yu's wrist. "Help me put it on, hubby."

The transformation was striking - ordinary Wen Qing now radiated elegance. Song Daming drooled: "Let's go!"

Wen Qing beamed: "Thanks for the watch, uncle! But I choose my husband over acting!"

"You tricked me!" Song Daming roared.

"You said 'consider'. I considered." She tugged Guan Yu toward exit.

"STOP!" Song Daming blocked them. "Nobody humiliates me! Either come quietly, or—"

"Or what?" Guan Yu's voice dropped dangerously.

"Wait till my men—" Song Daming's threat ended as he flew across the room, crashing like overripe melon.

Chapter 998: Raging for Beauty’s Sake

The mall froze.

"I-I'm from the Song Clan!" The秃头scrambled backward as Guan Yu advanced.

Guan Yu paused. The Songs were commercial titans. But it changed nothing. His foot rose—

"Spare him, Brother Guan." A refined youth emerged - Song Shaoqin, family heir.

Guan Yu's heel crushed downward. A bloodcurdling scream followed.

Song Shaoqin's face darkened. "You dare disrespect the Songs?!"

Guan Yu smiled coldly. "Merely teaching trash disposal. Small-town folk like me wouldn't understand your ways."

"You'll regret this!" The heir seethed as medics carried the whimpering秃头away. The confrontation simmered, unresolved.
