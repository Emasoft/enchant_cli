“Considering the crowdedness and chaos in the ward here, and with so many young men around, we’ve arranged for the nurses to clear out a premium single-patient room for the patient to receive treatment,” Dean Yu quickly regained his composure and explained.

Guan Yu pressed his lips together and nodded in understanding.

“We don’t need a private room. This place is fine... Treatment works the same everywhere. Why waste money?” Mother Luo frowned timidly, clearly hesitant about spending extra.

“Don’t worry—this special care room won’t cost more. Rest assured, ma’am,” Dean Yu said cheerfully, glancing at Guan Yu.

“Since the private room is available, let’s move. Mother Luo, don’t worry—I’ll cover the expenses,” Guan Yu said firmly, knowing how a woman relying on meager income to care for orphans would prioritize frugality.

Besides, Luo Cheng and his brothers had no space to sit, crammed together with seven or eight young men. A private room would ease the congestion.

Seeing Guan Yu’s approval, Dean Yu waved urgently, directing nurses to transfer Mother Luo on a gurney out of the ward.

“No need to worry, lads. The private room won’t cost extra, and the hospital will reduce treatment fees!” Dean Yu assured Guan Yu and Luo Cheng with a smile.

Luo Cheng stared in confusion, while Guan Yu raised an eyebrow skeptically, awaiting explanation.

Du Xiaojuan, standing beside Guan Yu, tugged his sleeve nervously. To her, the dean’s generosity warranted gratitude, yet Guan Yu remained silent, locking eyes with the man.

Naive as she was, Guan Yu knew better—nothing came free. This dean, a stranger until today, had first pushed him to treat others, then switched to kindness after refusal. Something smelled fishy.

As the saying went: *Unearned favor hides schemes*. Hospitals weren’t charities. Waiving fees without reason? Guan Yu wanted answers.

Under Guan Yu’s probing gaze, Dean Yu smiled calmly and patted his shoulder. “Don’t overthink. We share the same goal—curing the patient. As for the fee waiver... I’d like to be your friend.” He extended a hand.

Guan Yu shook it firmly but declared, “Thank you, but medical costs are inevitable. I’ll pay as promised. Your kindness is appreciated, but we’ll settle every penny.”

Exchanging courtesies, they left the ward, leaving stunned patients behind.

“I thought there were no private rooms left?” grumbled a relative with hospital connections, eyeing the obvious favoritism.

After thanking the dean, Guan Yu’s group entered Mother Luo’s new room—spacious, equipped with TV, AC, sofa, and rest beds.

Mother Luo clasped Guan Yu’s hands tearfully. “Luo Cheng’s blessed to have you as a friend. Thank you, truly!”

Guan Yu waved off the praise awkwardly. Even without Luo Cheng, he’d have helped her—such selfless souls were rare nowadays.

Du Xiaojuan chatted cheerfully with Mother Luo, while Guan Yu, Niu Le, and Luo Cheng discussed plans. Hearing Guan Yu had dropped out to venture out, Luo Cheng’s crew lit up with interest.

Days together had bred deep respect. Luo Cheng sensed Guan Yu’s extraordinary potential and quietly resolved to tie their futures to his.

**Chapter 157: Your Smile’s Too Confident**

Though resolved, Luo Cheng kept silent around Mother Luo, chatting idly with Guan Yu and Niu Le.

The straightforward Niu Le bonded quickly with Luo Cheng’s crew, especially their reverence for Guan Yu.

Bored, they pulled out cards. As they played, Guan Yu shared money-making plans—lottery stalls had netted thousands, but antiques were his Nanjing gamble. A lucky 1.1 million yuan win at the market couldn’t be replicated easily.

When Guan Yu asked about faster earnings, Luo Cheng perked up. “Profitable trades? Liu Lao-da and the Fire Gang monopolize sand quarries. Construction sites pay daily fortunes, but no one rivals their grip.”

Guan Yu sighed—sand required underworld clout. Fights over such turf were common.

“Let’s play!” he redirected.

**Goldflower**—simple three-card poker. To spice it up, they bet cigarettes.

Du Xiaojuan peered over Guan Yu’s shoulder, gasping at his “terrible” hand. “Why keep a Jack high? Fold!”

Forced to discard, Guan Yu groaned. “Sit quietly and hold my cigarettes. No talking, okay?”

Next round: Guan Yu held a pair of eights. Four folded, leaving Luo Cheng and another.

Du Xiaojuan gripped his shirt, tense. Guan Yu, feigning uncertainty, folded—only for Luo Cheng to reveal a straight.

“How’d you know?” Luo Cheng asked.

“Your smile was too confident,” Guan Yu lied.

*Author’s Note: Dad’s hospital discharge delayed. Four chapters today—will make up tomorrow. Apologies for the chaos lately.*

**Chapter 158: Gambling**

Next deal: Guan Yu got a straight flush.

Du Xiaojuan stifled a gasp, pinching his arm excitedly—tipping others off. Everyone folded, leaving Guan Yu empty-handed.

“Not my fault! Their cards were worse!” she whispered.

Grinning, Guan Yu played blind next round.

“Ready to lose cigarettes?” Luo Cheng taunted, tossing one in.

A brother with two Queens pretended indecision before betting.

Round after round, the pot grew. Finally, Guan Yu revealed a 2-4-3 straight—beating Luo Cheng’s two Jacks and another’s two Aces.

“Luck!” Guan Yu crowed as Du Xiaojuan collected winnings.

Twenty minutes later, Guan Yu dominated—winning hundreds of “pretend” cards through unseen hands.

Blind luck? Or something else.

“How?” they groaned.

Guan Yu just smiled. With his **Inspection Skill**, every card lay bare—cheating never felt so right.
