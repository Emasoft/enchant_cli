Before the incident involving the wealthy family, no one had fully understood the relationship between Guan Yu and Jiang Zigi. Even Wen Baoguo only knew they held grudges against each other, unaware of their deeper ties. Hearing Jiang Zigi address Guan Yu affectionately as "Young Master Guan" over the phone while Guan Yu responded with detached indifference, Wen Baoguo instantly suspected some clandestine dealings between them.

Unaware of his father-in-law’s swirling suspicions, Guan Yu replied casually, "We’re alright. He’s my younger brother."

"Jiang Zigi… is his younger brother?" Wen Baoguo shook his head, his disdain for Guan Yu deepening. Jiang Zigi was the future heir of the prestigious Jiang family in the capital, his status and influence far surpassing Guan Yu’s. In some respects, the Jiang family even overshadowed the Wen family. The idea of Jiang Zigi serving as Guan Yu’s subordinate was preposterous!

This brash youngster’s lies grew more brazen by the day.

Even Wen Shuquan harbored doubts. Given Jiang Zigi’s stature, it was impossible for him to subordinate himself to anyone, let alone Guan Yu.

Noticing their skepticism, Guan Yu offered no explanation. "If Grandfather and Father-in-law have nothing else, I’ll retire for the night."

"Go ahead," Wen Shuquan waved dismissively.

"Father, you—" Wen Baoguo began, but was cut off.

"I know what you’re thinking," Wen Shuquan interjected. "Yes, I intend to proceed."

"What?!" Wen Baoguo exclaimed. "Father, him? Is he capable?"

Wen Shuquan glared. "If not him, then you? You couldn’t even give me a grandson! With no son to rely on, shall I not pin hopes on my granddaughter’s husband?"

Wen Baoguo stiffened, humiliation silencing him. Though the patriarch doted on Wen Qing, he had always yearned for a male heir. Years ago, Wen Baoguo’s health had failed—not only rendering him infertile, but even incapable of fulfilling basic marital duties.

......

After leaving the study, Guan Yu retreated to the guest room prepared by Liu Yunshu. While the patriarch favored him, Wen Baoguo’s hostility ensured he couldn’t linger near Wen Qing’s quarters.

"Wife, I miss you," Guan Yu texted from bed.

Wen Qing’s reply nearly made him choke: "Husband, which part of me do you miss?"

This infuriating girl! Couldn’t she recognize his loneliness? Now she dared tease him!

"Every part. I crave your soft buns and sweet grapes…"

Hmph! Vulgar man!

Blushing furiously at his innuendo, Wen Qing nonetheless felt heat pooling within. "Husband… I miss you too."

"Where do you miss me?" he pressed.

"Your… big banana…"

The drafted message lingered unsent. Since that night when Guan Yu had compared himself to the fruit, bananas had become irrevocably… charged. As warmth flooded her core, tragedy struck—her trembling finger hit send.

When no reply came, Guan Yu assumed she’d fallen asleep. Then his phone chimed. Reading her accidental text, desire ignited. "Wait for me, wife!" he responded, hastily dressing.

At her door, he knocked. Burying her crimson face in blankets, Wen Qing called out, "I’m asleep!"

Had it not been for the mortifying mishap, she might have welcomed him. Now, shame barred the way.

Chapter 977: Do You Think That Thing of Yours Is Made of Iron?

After endless waiting, Guan Yu nearly used supernatural means to enter. Restraining himself, he texted, "Wife, are you asleep?"

"…No," came the belated reply.

"Then open up! It’s freezing!"

Rolling her eyes at his theatrics, Wen Qing thought: Since when does this ox-like man feel cold? Pig! No—wolf! Lecherous wolf!

Had he known her thoughts, Guan Yu would’ve stormed in to spank her.

"Darling, I’m shivering! I’ll catch cold!"

Silence.

"Fine! Behold my trump card!" Grinning, Guan Yu typed: "My Little Guan Yu is protesting. Since you’re asleep, I’ll comfort him alone. Let’s hope this doesn’t damage anything… Goodnight!"

The mock-tragic message brimmed with implication. "Such an actor!" Wen Qing snorted, yet worry gnawed. What if abstinence harmed him? Perhaps just this once…

As she rose to relent, a stern voice thundered: "Skulking here at this hour?"

Guan Yu whirled to find Wen Baoguo glowering.

"Shouldn’t I ask you that? Sneaking up like a ghost!"

"Since when do you fear anything?" Wen Baoguo sneered, eyeing the man who dared oppose him.

"Even lions startle!" Guan Yu retorted, studying his father-in-law’s haggard appearance. "Father-in-law… having trouble performing again?"

Wen Baoguo nearly spat blood. "Keep away from my daughter! One misstep and I’ll skin you!"

"Wait!" Guan Yu halted his retreat. "How’s your… marital life lately?"

The impertinent question surprisingly didn’t anger Wen Baoguo. Though scowling, pride flickered across his face—thanks to Guan Yu’s medical skills, his long-dormant vigor had returned.

"Want to improve further?" Guan Yu whispered conspiratorially. "One hour of steel endurance…"

"Steel? Think you’re iron-cast?" Wen Baoguo scoffed.

Guan Yu burst out laughing. This stern minister had hidden comedic talents!

Chapter 978: Durable and Long-lasting

After suppressed snickers and false reluctance, Wen Baoguo submitted to another acupuncture session. That night, thunderous conjugal noises kept the entire household awake.

Come morning, Patriarch Wen yawned incessantly. "Just… insufficient rest," he grumbled, having endured his son’s nocturnal resurgence.

Wen Qing gaped at her rejuvenated mother. "Mom! You look twenty years younger!"

Liu Yunshu glowed with post-coital radiance. Meanwhile, Wen Baoguo slept late—exhausted yet oddly dissatisfied. His wife’s renewed appetite proved… overwhelming.

At breakfast, Guan Yu smirked. His "medical treatment" had served dual purposes: mending fences and avenging interference. Let the old man learn not to block amorous pursuits!
