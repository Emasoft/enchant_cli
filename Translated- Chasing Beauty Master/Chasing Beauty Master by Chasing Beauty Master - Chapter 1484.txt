“However, these matters must follow proper procedures and logic. If soldiers under Magistrate Pang’s command die, he must report to higher authorities, submit the number of casualties and their causes, and after passing the review, compensation funds will be disbursed. But this requires a lengthy process.

Initially, Guan Yu suspected Magistrate Pang had embezzled the compensation funds, but that wasn’t the case. The truth was Magistrate Pang had never reported the deaths at all, which meant the funds never arrived. He dared not file the reports because doing so would require extensive documentation detailing the circumstances.

Given how Young Master Li had already plunged the town into chaos, Magistrate Pang feared drawing attention from above. If inspectors were sent, his downfall would be inevitable. Thus, he withheld the reports, and the compensation never reached the families. Of course, the bereaved families here knew nothing of the process, so the matter was left unresolved.

**Chapter 3,868: Wait a Little Longer**

Magistrate Pang hadn’t expected Young Master Jiang to suddenly bring this up in the middle of the night, likely after visiting Liu Yun’s home.

“Young Master Jiang, let me explain,” Magistrate Pang said after a pause. “It’s not that I withheld the compensation from Liu Yun’s family, nor did I embezzle it—I would never dare! The delay is simply due to the bureaucratic process. The funds must pass through multiple layers of approval before reaching me for distribution.”

Guan Yu studied him. “So you’re saying the incident *has* been reported, but the funds haven’t arrived yet?”

“Exactly. You must understand, Young Master Jiang, compensation isn’t disbursed overnight. All documentation must be meticulously prepared, submitted, and approved step-by-step. Once the funds arrive, I’ll distribute them immediately. We just need to wait a little longer.”

Guan Yu, unaware of the actual procedures—being an imposter of the real Young Master Jiang—found the explanation plausible. Obtaining funds from any bureaucracy involved tedious formalities and endless waiting.

Nodding, Guan Yu said, “Very well. Expedite the process—the families are suffering. But don’t concern yourself with Liu Yun’s case. I’ll soon send someone to relocate her and her daughter.”

“Of course, Young Master Jiang. Tomorrow, I’ll personally investigate the compensation’s progress,” Magistrate Pang replied hastily.

“Another matter,” Guan Yu added coldly. “Your efficiency is lacking.”

Since Guan Yu’s return that evening, his stern demeanor had left Magistrate Pang flustered.

“What else troubles you, Young Master Jiang?” Magistrate Pang asked, inwardly grumbling, *“Why won’t this nuisance leave? It’s late!”*

“What happened to Liu Yun’s eldest daughter?”

Magistrate Pang stiffened, realizing Liu Yun had spoken of this. He feigned remorse. “Young Master Jiang, I’ve long regretted this. The culprits were cunning. We searched the entire town for two days after her abduction but found nothing. Days later, her body was discovered by a stream outside town. This failure rests on my shoulders.”

He wore a pained expression, as if mourning his own child. Guan Yu thought, *“This man is quite the actor.”*

“Magistrate Pang, I’m not asking about the outcome—I want justice. Her murderer remains at large. Have you made *any* progress?”

Magistrate Pang was taken aback. *“Since when does he meddle in this?”* Yet he dared not voice his irritation.

“The investigation is ongoing. The killer likely isn’t local. Given the vastness of the jianghu, tracking them down will take time.”

“So her death will go unavenged? No justice?” Guan Yu’s glare accused him of incompetence.

Magistrate Pang fell silent, fearing further slips.

“Tomorrow, give me a detailed report. If you’re incapable, Fourth-Rank Minister Jiang will handle it. We’ll scour the jianghu if needed.”

Magistrate Pang’s heart sank. If Guan Yu pursued this, Young Master Li’s involvement might surface. But with no evidence and the girl buried, even the Emperor couldn’t unravel it.

“As you command. The documents will be ready by morning.”

Guan Yu knew Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li were complicit. The girl’s death likely stemmed from disobedience in their slave trade. His demands were mere intimidation.

After Guan Yu left, Magistrate Pang returned to his chambers, finding Young Master Li carousing. “Why are you still here?”

“Where else? You’ve barred me from the underground chambers. Must I return home?”

“Once Young Master Jiang departs tomorrow, we resume.”

“He’s leaving? Excellent!”

**Chapter 3,869: Exhaustion**

Magistrate Pang braced for backlash. “But Liu Yun and her daughter—Young Master Jiang plans to move them to Qujiang City’s City Lord Manor.”

“*What?* They were part of my next batch!” Young Master Li roared.

“Quiet! If he hears, we’re dead!”

Young Master Li scoffed. “Fine. Plenty more women here. Once he’s gone, we’ll train the rest properly and sell them.”

Magistrate Pang chuckled. “Our venture thrives here, far from imperial eyes. This batch will fetch a fortune.”

“*You* profit while *I* labor,” Young Master Li grumbled. “You take 30% for sheltering me. I endure the toil.”

“Without my protection, you’d have no operation. Be content with your 70%.”

“Swap roles, then. You take 70%, handle the work, and I’ll lounge.”

Magistrate Pang forced a laugh. “A jest, Young Master Li. Our partnership thrives as is.”

Privately, Magistrate Pang seethed. Young Master Li’s cruelty made him indispensable for “training” slaves, but his volatility was a threat. Magistrate Pang dreamed of fleeing once wealthy enough.

Young Master Li mused, “Introduce me to Young Master Jiang. Such connections could expand our trade to Qujiang City.”

“What if he stays?”

“Gauge his interests. If he’s amenable, we’ll share profits. If not, he’ll learn nothing.”

Magistrate Pang panicked. “Too risky! We don’t know his stance.”

Young Master Li dismissed him. “I’ll test him. Prepare for the worst.”

Magistrate Pang resolved to pack his valuables, ready to flee if exposed.

**Chapter 3,870: Shortchanged**

At dawn, Magistrate Pang delivered the report. Guan Yu, dining on an extravagant breakfast, remarked, “Such feasts daily? An eighth-rank magistrate’s salary must be generous.”

Magistrate Pang simpered, “This humble official could never afford this normally! We prepared it solely for you, Young Master Jiang.”

“A farewell feast, then? Once I’m gone, you’ll celebrate freely?”

“N-No! Your presence honors us. Stay or leave as you wish!”

Magistrate Pang’s smile strained, wondering if Guan Yu suspected his crimes. The lavish meal masked his dread—one misstep could unravel everything.
