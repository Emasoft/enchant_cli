The man closed the distance in quick strides, arriving before Wei Hongwei with a grin. "Ah, Boss Wei! I went to your classroom earlier but you'd already left. I had to jog all the way to catch up!"

He panted heavily before continuing, "Here's the thing – could I treat you to dinner after school? Actually, my two friends and I all want to join Yu Gang. Everyone knows Yu Gang's power now – it's among the top organizations across all universities in City A!"

Wei Hongwei found these words immensely gratifying, immediately understanding the visitor's purpose.

**Chapter 2148: Deceived**

The man approached rapidly, repeating his earlier spiel about seeking admission to Yu Gang through dinner negotiations. Wei Hongwei listened with practiced composure, well-versed in these recruitment rituals.

Nowadays, joining Yu Gang wasn't as simple as before. Prospective members underwent rigorous identity checks and reputation assessments. The organization guarded against spies from rival gangs and refused to admit scoundrels – though exceptions existed for those with strong connections to veteran members.

This petitioner clearly aimed to bypass formal procedures through lavish hospitality. "I'll need to consider this," Wei Hongwei said, stroking his chin. "Our current regulations are quite strict." His companion Jia Bo chimed in: "Exactly. Boss Guan issued firm orders – we're nearly at capacity already."

Their words echoed Guan Yu's actual policy of quality over quantity in recruitment. Undeterred, the petitioner pressed: "Surely someone as magnanimous as you can make exceptions? Tonight's venue will be extraordinary – far superior to our school cafeteria. You understand..."

Before Wei Hongwei could respond, Jia Bo's eyes lit up. "Really? How come I've never heard of this place?" Though tempted, Wei Hongwei hesitated – while Guan Yu might merely scold them, their mutual acquaintance Qian Yaoyao would skin them alive if discovered.

"Rest assured, gentlemen. I'll await you at the school gates after dismissal." The petitioner departed with a satisfied smile after Jia Bo impulsively accepted the invitation.

"You idiot!" Wei Hongwei hissed. "Should I report this to the boss immediately?" Jia Bo glared disdainfully at his companion's feigned reluctance, seeing through the hypocrisy.

"Go ahead. Let's see whether Guan Yu or Qian Yaoyao arrives faster." The threat drained color from Wei Hongwei's face – Jia Bo's constant leverage through Qian's influence had become unbearable.

After prolonged bickering and pretended reluctance, the pair eventually agreed to attend. By dusk, they found themselves entering a black van waiting at the school gates.

**Chapter 2149: Left Turn**

As the van journeyed through increasingly unfamiliar terrain, Wei Hongwei grew suspicious. "This route seems wrong." Their driver abruptly swerved into a remote grove, vanishing after locking them inside the vehicle.

Dizziness overwhelmed the captives as consciousness slipped away. Young Master Feng emerged from the shadows, smirking: "With these pawns, everything becomes easier."

Meanwhile, Guan Yu maintained his usual routine at Jin Hua's residence – his movements carefully obscured from Feng family spies through coordinated maneuvers with Hou Jinshun at Night Blossom Club.

At 9 PM, an unknown caller interrupted Guan Yu's evening. "You... Guan Yu?" came heavily accented Mandarin. The voice belonged to Ma He, seeking vengeance for his brother Ma Hai's death.

"Your friends will die unless you come alone within the hour," Ma He threatened, forcing Guan Yu into a treacherous journey guided by phone instructions. Through coded repetitions, Guan Yu alerted his allies while maintaining the charade.

**Chapter 2150: Release Them First**

Plunging into dense woodland per Ma He's directions, Guan Yu activated protective shields against potential ambush. Moonlight glinted off Ma He's dagger as he materialized beneath a white poplar.

"Release my friends first," Guan Yu demanded, buying time while sensing allies' approach. The kidnapper sneered: "After I kill you, they'll go free."

Their confrontation thrummed with tension – Ma He's combat-ready stance contrasting Guan Yu's strategic delay tactics. Unbeknownst to both, Jia Bo and Wei Hongwei remained imprisoned miles away at a Feng family warehouse, their fate hanging in the balance as distant allies closed in through shadowed woods.
