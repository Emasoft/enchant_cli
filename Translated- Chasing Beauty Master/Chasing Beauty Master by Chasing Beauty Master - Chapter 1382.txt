Guan Yu nodded with a smile. "You're quite clever. That's exactly right. Since I didn't bring extra magazines here, I can only fire seven times. If we were in my hometown, there'd be plenty of these bullets."

"I've never seen such a miraculous thing before. It's incredible how this tiny object can blow someone's head apart without spiritual energy. Truly terrifying. I wonder who could create such a powerful treasure," came the awed response.

Shaking his head helplessly, Guan Yu explained, "This isn't crafted through cultivation but manufactured. Never mind—you wouldn't understand yet. You'll learn gradually. When you visit my homeland, you'll witness real marvels."

"Now that you mention it, I'm truly eager to visit sooner. It must be an extraordinarily fascinating place."

"Naturally. It's an entirely different world. You'll discover countless conveniences beyond imagination here," Guan Yu remarked as dawn broke outside. "I must report to the back mountain now. Further delay might cause complications."

Wang Xiaorong's face betrayed reluctance, yet she found no pretext to detain him, silently nodding instead.

"You're in grave danger here," Guan Yu cautioned. "Though your people lurk nearby, facing elders like Xuanming directly remains perilous. The Yunqing Sect is mobilizing against your Demon Soul Sect. Return home promptly."

"I know. Stay vigilant here. If you miss me, find a way to contact me."

After nodding and dressing, Guan Yu waved farewell and departed. Arriving at the back mountain's towering gate, he found it shut as usual—the deaf guard Xiao Dong would only open it after Jiu Shiye detected visitors.

Contemplating the gate's impractical height, Guan Yu nearly resorted to pounding when it creaked open. Xiao Dong gestured invitation from within. "Must you always dawdle?" Guan Yu complained loudly, knowing the guard couldn't hear. Inside, Jiu Shiye sat meditating on a tatami mat, prayer beads sliding through his fingers.

"Respected Jiu Shiye," Guan Yu greeted courteously. "Those prayer beads—have you embraced Buddhism?"

In this region without organized faiths, where villagers worshipped minor deities like the Earth God, the beads seemed incongruous. Guan Yu recalled Jiu Shiye previously lacked them—this new devotion might deepen the elder's already profound stillness, perhaps enabling days-long meditation.

"You've come," Jiu Shiye intoned without movement, as if addressing a routine visitor.

"Punishment for offending Master. I'm to assist guarding the mountain while under confinement."

Jiu Shiye raised an eyebrow. "What transgression warranted this? I assumed you sought spell storage."

"I injured Chief Xiang. Master condemned it as insubordination. Hence my exile here."

"A grandmaster old enough to be your grandfather? Did you employ the Emperor's Seal techniques?"

Guan Yu admitted, "Necessary when provoked relentlessly. He sought to expel me—I had no choice."

"Respect your elders regardless," Jiu Shiye chided. "Endure their discipline gracefully."

"Shouldn't elders nurture juniors rather than harass them?" Guan Yu countered, then tactfully added, "Though I acted rashly in anger. Regrets linger."

Satisfied with this contrition, Jiu Shiye gestured seating. "Xuanming's intentions? Any instructions?"

"Only to guard against demonic theft of the Hidden Dragon Sword. No further orders."

"Xuanming protects you. Normally, offenders go to Bamboo Peak. He likely spared you harsh punishment through Xiang and Mu's alliance. This secluded confinement serves your safety."

Guan Yu acknowledged his master's benevolence—Xuanming's gifts of artifacts and special training proved exceptional favor, however politically motivated.

"Indeed, Master treats me as his own, aiding through every trial," Guan Yu replied diplomatically, concealing private reservations about Yunqing's orthodoxy before this pillar of tradition.

"Natural you receive preferential treatment," Jiu Shiye noted. "A rare prodigy mastering both magic and martial arts—Yunqing's future pillar and deterrent against rivals."

Changing subject, Guan Yu produced the Emperor's Seal. "What spell shall we store this time? Your assistance honors me."

"The technique that wounded Xiang? Its explosive force resembles... 'missiles'?"

Avoiding technological explanations, Guan Yu requested the same spell. Jiu Shiye scheduled storage in two days—time needed to repel anticipated demonic incursions.

When questioned about recent missions, Guan Yu described the failed acquisition of Eight-Drum Artifacts, revealing instead cloth inscribed with demonic text: "Beneath Golden City, upon Divine Stone Mountain, when blossoms bloom and fragrant winds carry far, divine power unveils."

"Golden City..." Jiu Shiye mused. "Likely refers to the shifting desert metropolis—Miao City. Its nighttime lights gild surrounding sands like golden waves."

"Then 'Divine Stone Mountain'?" Guan Yu pressed.

"Uncertain. Three centuries past, I pursued wolf-demons there but saw no mountains. 'Blossoming season' suggests summer's peak—yet locating Miao City proves arduous enough, ever-moving through sandstorms."

Guan Yu grimaced. "Must this involve deadly desert treks? Our primitive equipment endangers seekers."

"True peril," Jiu Shiye concurred. "We only found it tracking wounded wolf-demons. Remember—Miao City shelters predominantly demons, unwelcoming to humans. Yet the Eight-Drums' power could shift our era's balance. He who claims it commands supremacy."
