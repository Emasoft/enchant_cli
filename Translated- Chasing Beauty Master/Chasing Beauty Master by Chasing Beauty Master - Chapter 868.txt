“I know Aunt Qing and Ling’er well,” said Yang Conghan, for Aunt Qing would occasionally visit Ling’er at the Midnight Blossom Club during her free time, allowing Yang to become acquainted with them.

“They’re here? But I can’t move right now. Please have them come up,” Guan Yu said in surprise. He hadn’t expected Aunt Qing to personally visit him despite her frail health and the long journey’s strain.

“Yes, I’ll have them wait in the lobby with some fruit first. I’ll bring them up shortly,” Xue Jing replied before leaving. In the lobby, she overheard Aunt Qing profusely thanking Yang Conghan for her care of Ling’er.

“Ling’er, tell your aunt not to stand on ceremony. We’re family here,” Yang urged, eventually resorting to having Ling’er intervene when her own reassurances fell short.

“No, we truly must thank you—and especially Brother Guan for his kindness. Without your help, our family would have been ruined long ago,” Ling’er added.

After exhaustively expressing her gratitude, Aunt Qing finally settled into a seat. Though her demeanor seemed rustic, her warmth and sincerity charmed the young women present, who found her deeply maternal.

Guan Yu’s companions—all remarkably kind-hearted and devoid of class prejudice—came from affluent backgrounds yet never looked down on the less fortunate. The Yang and Lü families alone donated staggering sums annually to charitable causes. Lü Mei, in particular, frequently visited nursing homes and rural areas to aid elderly people without children, her compassion mirroring Guan Yu’s own.

Xue Jing returned smiling. “Auntie, we’re all friends here. Please enjoy some fruit.”

“Thank you, thank you,” Aunt Qing accepted the fruit, then marveled, “Coming here has been an eye-opener. I once thought my daughter the most beautiful woman alive, but after meeting you all…” She shook her head in wonder.

“You resemble celestial goddesses, each uniquely radiant. Even an old woman like me is captivated! Guan Yu’s discernment is extraordinary—such perfection seems painted by a master’s brush.”

Though unspoken, Aunt Qing privately realized why Guan Yu hadn’t pursued Ling’er romantically. While Ling’er’s beauty rivaled anyone’s, the other women’s cultivated elegance created an intangible distinction. Had she known these goddesses had actively followed Guan Yu here, her astonishment would have deepened.

Surveying the lavish villa, Aunt Qing grasped Guan Yu’s wealth—a scale of living beyond her rural experience, where such grandeur seemed almost wasteful for so few occupants.

“Auntie, Guan Yu awaits you upstairs,” Xue Jing prompted.

“Yes, yes. I wanted to bring gifts, but Ling’er insisted otherwise. How improper to visit a patient empty-handed!” Aunt Qing chided.

“Mother, look around—what could we possibly bring that he lacks?” Ling’er countered. During their journey, she’d dissuaded her mother from purchasing presents, arguing their futility against Guan Yu’s opulence—a point now vindicated by the villa’s abundance.

**Chapter 2222: The Guest Has Arrived**

Guan Yu pondered curiously—why did this family resist his properly acquired gifts? In cities, exchanges of presents and favors lubricated social interactions, yet here, his well-intentioned offerings met refusal.

The Qu family’s integrity made them appreciate but decline his luxuries. To the practical Aunt Qu, rural life had no use for such extravagance. Borrowing his luxury car might briefly impress neighbors, but ultimately, they remained country folk—a reality no vehicle could mask.

Her deeper motive lay in avoiding imposition: having Guan Yu grace Mei Mei’s wedding with his presence and car was blessing enough. Accepting more gifts felt exploitative.

Watching Shuang Shuang reluctantly return the iPhone, Guan Yu gently refused: “I never take back gifts.” To Aunt Qu, he appealed, “We’re family through Ling’er. Would you refuse her presents?”

Aunt Qing interceded: “Let Shuang Shuang keep it. Guan Yu has been our benefactor, caring for Ling’er in the city.”

Under collective persuasion, Aunt Qu relented. Guan Yu patted Shuang Shuang’s head. “Go play. Your mother approves.”

The girl scampered off, then turned at the doorway, sticking out her tongue. “You’re not my elder! No more head pats, Handsome Brother—but thanks!”

As the room laughed, Mei Mei wrestled with guilt—postponing her wedding to prioritize her mother’s leg treatment. “I’ll accompany you to the city tomorrow,” she insisted.

“Nonsense! Tomorrow’s your wedding,” Aunt Qu refused firmly.

Guan Yu intervened: “Let me help—top-tier doctors and facilities await through my connections. No cost.”

Ling’er corroborated: “The Yang and Lü families have private hospitals. Guan Yu’s word opens their doors.”

The room buzzed at this revelation. The village chief’s daughter gazed covetously, envisioning Guan Yu as her prince charming.

Pressed about treatment costs without his aid, Guan Yu estimated tens of thousands—a sum that silenced the room. Producing a thick wad of cash, he insisted: “Wedding gifts from guests are customary. Take this, or accept my medical help.”

Aunt Qu tearfully surrendered when Guan Yu linked the money to future wedding invitations. “But you’re unmarried!” she exclaimed.

“Not yet,” he admitted, sparking Ling’er’s silent eye-roll at his harem of beauties back home.

**Chapter 2223: Not Yet Married**

Accepting the cash, Aunt Qu vowed equivalent generosity at Guan Yu’s future wedding. He pressed: “Then you’ll undergo treatment—or I’ll exclude you from my guest list!”

Finally acquiescing, Aunt Qu asked about the procedure. “Similar to today’s therapy,” Guan Yu explained. “Biweekly sessions, ten cycles total, with recuperative care in between.”

Mei Mei’s conflicted heart fluttered—her postponed wedding plans now carried unexpected resonance.

Later, Shuang Shuang boldly proposed: “Handsome Brother, since you’re single… could I marry you someday?”

Amidst laughter, Mei Mei dragged her away. “Little daydreamer! Focus on school!”

“I’m seventeen!” Shuang Shuang protested. “If I married him, helping our family would be his duty!”

Though privately acknowledging Guan Yu’s merits, Aunt Qu demurred: “You’re too young, and he’s beyond our station.” Yet in her daughter’s starry eyes sparkled the timeless rural dream—that love might bridge worlds.
