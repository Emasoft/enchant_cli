After finishing her meal, Wang Xiaorong patted her belly and said, “You two head back to the inn first. I’ll fetch something and join you shortly.”

Back at the inn, Siqi asked, “Guanyu, can we really trust that Wang Xiaorong? Could she be working with Black Blood Ridge?”

Guanyu knew Siqi harbored prejudice against Wang Xiaorong, but he felt certain she wasn’t involved. Even if she were allied with Black Blood Ridge, lurking near Guanyu would serve no purpose. “We’ve no other options,” he replied. “To rescue Xiaotong safely, we must trust her. I believe she genuinely wants to help.”

Siqi sat anxiously on a stool, wondering when Xiao Zhi and Aze would return. All they could do now was wait. Guanyu, meanwhile, hoped for a message from Black Blood Ridge—its arrival would confirm Xiaotong’s temporary safety.

“Guanyu,” Siqi pressed, “why would Black Blood Ridge kidnap Xiaotong? Does she have a grudge with them? Impossible. She’s trained at Yunqing Sect for nearly a decade and never left the mountain. How could she offend them?”

Guanyu poured himself tea. “It’s complicated yet simple. Black Blood Ridge knows our identities and that I carry an extraordinary artifact. They likely took her as leverage.”

“Then we’re in serious trouble!”

“Which is why we must strike first. Without Xiaorong’s help, we’re lost.”

Siqi nodded grimly. “We’ve no choice but to wait.”

Beyond Qujiang City lay a range of mountains. Among them stood the shortest peak—Black Blood Ridge’s stronghold. Years of construction had expanded the base, its grand buildings mere facades. Most disciples dwelled within the hollowed mountain itself.

In a cavernous chamber, three figures gathered. A middle-aged man in crimson robes sat atop a fur-draped seat—the Blood Lord. Beside him stood Heibao (Black Panther), clad in the sect’s signature black uniform accented with white shoulder panels. On the floor lay Xiaotong, unconscious but unharmed in her pink lotus-patterned dress.

“Lord, why capture this delicate girl?” Heibao asked. “She’s not your usual... taste.”

“I’ve no interest in her,” the Blood Lord sneered. “Once my plans solidify, she’s yours.”

“My gratitude!” Heibao bowed. “But why take her at all?”

“Our spy in Yunqing Sect reports that among their five下山 disciples is Guanyu—holder of the Fentian Furnace. I must claim it.”

“The Fentian Furnace?!” Heibao gasped. “The treasure forged centuries ago by our founder, Bloodwing Patriarch?!”

“Precisely. It vanished for ages until Yunqing’s Lu Shouzuo possessed it. Now it’s inexplicably with Guanyu, a mere novice. We’ll use the girl to trade.”

“Why not just seize him?”

“He’s no ordinary disciple,” the Blood Lord warned. “He reached the semifinals in Six Peaks Tournament and wields other artifacts. Capture won’t be easy.”

“Your wisdom shines, Lord. Once we reclaim our treasure, unifying the Demonic Sects will be inevitable!”

“Hah! Once I hold the furnace, even Demon Soul Sect’s old ghost won’t be fit to shine my shoes!”

Their laughter echoed through the cavern.

At the inn, Guanyu paced. “Xiao Zhi and Aze should’ve returned by now. And Xiaorong’s late—was she lying?”

Before Siqi could answer, footsteps approached. “Impatient, aren’t you?” Wang Xiaorong’s voice chimed as she entered. “Those fools still missing? You’ll wait ten days chasing Black Blood Ridge blindly!”

Guanyu sighed. “We’ve no direction to search. They’ll return by dawn.” He longed for modern conveniences—phones didn’t exist in this backward world.

“Then we wait.” Xiaorong sat beside him. “Tea?” Though the pot sat nearby, she clearly expected service. Guanyu obliged with a cool cup.

“Yours, I’ll drink even cold.” She grinned impishly.

Seizing the moment, Guanyu asked, “What of the Demonic Sects’ movements? How does Black Blood Ridge fit?”

“Curious?” She arched a brow. “Black Blood Ridge is but a branch. Centuries ago, the Demonic Sect united under four lords: Blood Lord, Obsession Lord, Demon Lord, and Aberration Lord. After their leader’s assassination, infighting shattered the sect into four factions—Black Blood Ridge, Obsidian Hunters, Demon Soul Sect, and Monstrous Cavern.”

“And now?”

“They’re shadows of their past. When orthodox sects learned of their weakness, they attacked en masse. Seven days of carnage left both sides depleted.”

Guanyu noted her disdain for “orthodox hypocrisy.” Her phrasing betrayed allegiance—likely Demonic Sect herself. Yet he pressed on: “Is Black Blood Ridge weakest?”

“Pathetically so. Demon Soul Sect nearly reunified us, but the Eight-Sided Drum—our sacred relic—vanished after the old leader’s death.”

Xiaorong’s voice hardened. “Orthodox sects preach righteousness yet slaughter innocents. If we reunite, we’ll avenge百年之辱!”

“Lies!” Siqi snapped. “Righteous sects would never—”

“Summon Yunqing’s leader Xuánming! He’d pale before the truth!”

Guanyu intervened before identities were exposed. “Arguing helps nothing.”

Internally, he marveled—Xiaorong clearly knew they were Yunqing disciples yet baited them. Her knowledge ran deep: Black Blood Ridge’s terrain was a maze of traps, their signature Bloodwing Art once countered immortal cultivators with preternatural speed. The Fentian Furnace’s history chilled him—this artifact in his possession had belonged to the legendary Bloodwing Patriarch.

As Xiaorong detailed ancient betrayals, Guanyu and Siqi exchanged glances. The furnace’s dark legacy explained the kidnapping. Black Blood Ridge wanted it back.

Yet Guanyu kept silent. The fewer who knew, the safer. Let them think him ignorant. Survival depended on outmaneuvering enemies on all sides—Demonic and orthodox alike.
