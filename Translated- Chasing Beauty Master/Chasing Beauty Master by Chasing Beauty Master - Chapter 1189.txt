“The mayor is here, everyone make way, make way…” a guard shouted from behind. The crowd parted to create a path, and Mayor Wang walked toward the house.

Upon entering the house, they found an elderly woman lying on the floor. She appeared to have died recently, her body still warm.

Mayor Wang knew this old woman was also surnamed Wang, a childless widow who had lived alone here for years. She seemed to have no other relatives. Half a year ago, Granny Wang had already been bedridden by illness, relying on the care of neighbors and villagers who occasionally brought her medicine and food to sustain her until now.

Hearing that someone had been killed, they came to discover that Granny Wang had passed away. It seemed she had succumbed to her illness, with no obvious wounds on her body—no sign of foul play.

Mayor Wang then declared loudly, “Granny Wang has departed due to illness. Let us all mourn her.”

“Ah, Granny Wang was over ninety. Who would have thought she’d pass like this?”

“I visited her just yesterday, brought her a bowl of millet porridge. She ate happily. Never imagined she’d leave us today.”

The crowd buzzed with议论. Some said her advanced age made her death unsurprising, others argued that despite her chronic illness, she had still shown vitality and shouldn’t have died so abruptly.

Mayor Wang covered Granny’s body with a white cloth and addressed the crowd: “Granny Wang contributed greatly to our town—a kind grandmother to us all. Without kin, we are her family. Let us prepare her funeral together.”

“Yes! Let us send Granny on her final journey!”

“Agreed! We are all Granny’s descendants…”

The crowd endorsed the mayor’s proposal. Gradually, more people gathered at Granny’s home. The coffin shop owner from the north end even donated a large coffin, wishing Granny peace in her afterlife.

Mayor Wang added, “Granny contributed much to our town. Let us carry her through the streets one last time, so she may remember our home.”

The crowd agreed. Soon, townsfolk brought white cloth and began preparations—cutting ribbons, adorning doorframes with mourning symbols.

Meanwhile, Guanyu awoke to gloomy skies. At breakfast with the Lin family, he inquired about recent events. Lin Zhonggeng reported no sign of the Li family except Mayor Wang’s suspicious westward patrol.

Suspecting the Li clan hid in the west, Guanyu and his companion Jinyu Lang ventured there. They discovered an abandoned courtyard with recent footprints leading to a hidden cellar beneath coffins.

There, they intercepted a clandestine meeting between the mayor’s wife and Li family members disguised as mourners. As the funeral procession approached, Guanyu confronted them:

“You’ve hidden well, but justice always prevails. Your escape ends here.”

The mayor’s wife recognized him. “Guanyu? How did you find us?”

“Your schemes unravel. The truth behind Granny Wang’s death and your collusion with the Li family ends now.”
