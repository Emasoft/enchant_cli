“Wang Zhen laughed, though it was a bitter sound. ‘Leave? You still have the face to tell me to leave? Do you even know what shame is?’

‘Wang Zhen!’ Wang Siyu’s expression suddenly turned cold as she shouted.

‘I’m only giving you this warning out of our last shred of past affection. Don’t think that gives you the right to yell at me. You don’t have that right!’

‘Yell at you? Are you worthy?’ Wang Zhen sneered.

‘I must’ve been blind to let you be my girlfriend!’ Wang Zhen looked at Wang Siyu with contempt.

Wang Siyu’s face darkened. ‘Wang Zhen, you’re forcing my hand!’

‘Force you? What will you do? Call your new man to teach me a lesson?’ Wang Zhen mocked.

‘Shungang is better than you. You have to admit that!’ Wang Siyu said expressionlessly, the last trace of affection in her heart vanishing instantly.

Wu Shungang’s vanity swelled. He puffed out his chest and glared defiantly at Wang Zhen.

‘Does he treat you well, or is it his money that treats you well?’ Wang Zhen said sarcastically.

Wang Siyu’s face grew uglier. ‘At least Shungang has character. He won’t grovel and be someone’s lackey forever!’

She resented Wang Zhen’s willingness to serve Guan Yu while abandoning his own ambitions, especially after he slapped her. She’d begun looking down on him.

‘Shallow woman!’ Wang Zhen said with disgust.

At this moment, he questioned why he’d been so angry when he first saw Wang Siyu. Now, it seemed utterly worthless.

‘If that’s how it is, I’ve nothing more to say! Leave now. Shungang and I have a boat ride to enjoy!’ Wang Siyu’s tone was icy.

Instantly, Wang Zhen snapped.

Not because he still had feelings for Wang Siyu, but because her disdain and contempt challenged his dignity as a man.

‘I’m telling you—I’m blocking this waterway!’ Wang Zhen roared, fury evident.

‘You brought this on yourself. I won’t interfere.’ Wang Siyu said indifferently, turning away. ‘Shungang, handle it yourself.’

**Chapter 865: Escalation**

Wu Shungang relished this outcome. As Wang Siyu’s new man, he felt triumph and satisfaction.

He called his men, and soon the narrow waterway filled with boats and thugs.

Wang Zhen and Niu Le were surrounded.

‘Brother, we’re in for a fight!’ Wang Zhen said.

Niu Le grinned. ‘I’ve fought worse!’

The thugs attacked. Chaos erupted as men tumbled into the water.

Though outnumbered, Niu Le fought fiercely. But Wang Zhen, weaker and overwhelmed, was beaten down.

Wu Shungang smirked. ‘This is his own fault.’

Wang Siyu watched coldly.

Amid the chaos, Guan Yu arrived.

‘Who dares bully my brother?!’ Guan Yu roared, hurling thugs into the water.

**Chapter 866: Falling into the Water**

Guan宇 cleared a path, reaching Wu Shungang’s boat.

‘Choose: jump now or after I drown you!’

Wu Shungang paled.

**Chapter 867: Beating the Drowned Dog**

Guan宇’s fury erupted. Thugs fled as he dismantled their ranks.

‘My brother—you dare touch him?!’

Wu Shungang, battered and humiliated, jumped into the water.

The battle ended with the bullies routed and the lovers’ betrayal exposed.

Guan宇 stood victorious, protecting his friends.
