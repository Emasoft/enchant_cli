The Second-in-Command nodded and said, “Guan Yu has always been my idol—the one I admire most. I’ve long yearned to become a Realm Sovereign expert like him, but alas, my aptitude is too low, and I’ve encountered no fortuitous opportunities.” He shook his head helplessly.

“Cultivation cannot be forced, Second-in-Command. Don’t rush things. Without serendipity or destiny, ascending to the Realm Sovereign realm is harder than climbing to heaven. Still, reaching the Second-Rank Pseudo-Psychic level in such a short time is remarkable.”

“I understand. The reason my cultivation advanced so swiftly is because I sold everything of value to obtain the Great Huang Empire’s experimental Potential Awakening Serum. If misused, this serum kills the user instantly. Fortunately, my luck held, and my cultivation rose by a tier. Today’s incident was a misunderstanding. I trust Guan Yu’s character—he wouldn’t deliberately cause trouble. If you ever need my help in the future, come find me. I’ll assist to the best of my ability.”

Xue Jing hadn’t expected the Second-in-Command to be so reasonable. She thanked him and left McRae’s with Guan Yu and the others.

Xue Jing assumed Guan Yu would question her about her past before amnesia, but to her surprise, he remained silent. Curiosity gnawed at her. Logically, he should be eager to know—why hadn’t he asked? She finally blurted, “Guan Yu, don’t you have anything to ask me?”

Guan Yu smiled. “If you wished to speak, you’d have volunteered. If not, no question would pry it from you. Had my companions wanted me to know about my past, they’d have told me long ago—not waited until now.”

After the McRae’s incident, Wei Hongwei, euphoric at surviving his brush with death, dragged Wang Xiaoqian to a hotel room.

A mundane weekend passed. On Monday morning, Guan Yu and Lü Mei sat silently in class when Wei Hongwei rushed in, panting.

Leaning close to Guan Yu’s ear, he whispered, “Brother Guan! My informant saw Liu Shuowei take a female classmate to a hotel yesterday afternoon—probably another victim. Last night, he took her to the Blue Mountain Street villa apartments!”

“No mistake? It was definitely Liu Shuowei?” Guan Yu asked.

“No doubt. My informant witnessed it firsthand,” Wei Hongwei confirmed.

Guan Yu pondered. “I’ll speak with Liu Shuowei. But what about you? You’ve been with Wang Xiaoqian awhile—what’s your take on her?”

Wei Hongwei blinked, puzzled by the sudden topic. “She… usually keeps a straight face, but when excited, she’s quite… enthusiastic. Let’s just say her… appetites are substantial. Two nights ago, she kept me up till dawn. I needed a full day’s sleep to recover!”

Guan Yu wore a half-smile. “Brother, while physical needs matter, don’t neglect your health. Seriously though—I suspect Wang Xiaoqian is purposefully dating you. Her motives likely extend beyond you. Stay vigilant.”

Wei Hongwei frowned. “Impossible! Brother Guan, don’t joke about this! Xiaoqian’s done nothing wrong!”

“You’re blinded by affection. I’ve no reason to sow discord. Just consider—what did Wang Xiaoqian do throughout Saturday’s events at McRae’s?”

Leaning on Guan Yu’s desk, Wei Hongwei recalled. “Nothing unusual. She stayed by me… but acted like a bystander, completely detached.”

Guan Yu clapped his shoulder. “Exactly. She never spoke, never reacted. Not a flicker of fear—even when facing a Second-Rank Pseudo-Psychic expert. I’d wager her abilities surpass the Second-in-Command’s.”

Wei Hongwei’s eyes widened. “That powerful? But Brother Guan, finding a girlfriend’s hard! Even if she’s strong, that doesn’t prove she’s using me!”

Guan Yu glared at his hapless friend. “Did her… enthusiasm crush your brain? Recall how you met!”

Nearby, Lü Mei burst into laughter at Guan Yu’s crude remark. Flustered, Wei Hongwei scratched his head. “Ahem… right! If Xiaoqian’s so capable, she shouldn’t have been kidnapped by thugs.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Precisely. Your informant’s tip about Liu Shuowei threatening a girl turned out to be false—leading you to ‘rescue’ Wang Xiaoqian. Clearly, she fabricated the tip to approach you. Either that, or your informant’s compromised.”

Wei Hongwei, ever impulsive, whipped out his phone. “I’ll call her! Demand answers!”

Guan Yu stopped him. “Don’t alert her. She’s made no overt moves yet—she’ll just deny everything. Focus on Liu Shuowei. Today’s tip was likely another trap. From now on, consult me before acting. Keep using your informant—but stay wary.”

After Wei Hongwei returned to his seat, Guan Yu called Xue Jing. “Jing, how’s your homeroom teacher behaving? Any harassment?”

“He’s been quiet lately,” Xue Jing replied.

“Good. Let’s lunch together. Bye.” Hanging up, Guan Yu dialed Liu Shuowei. “Teacher Liu, I hear you’ve been… busy. Let’s meet at the cafeteria. I’ll return your phone.”

Liu Shuowei eagerly agreed, desperate to reclaim the damning evidence. At lunch, Guan Yu casually mentioned, “Wei Hongwei’s new girlfriend Wang Xiaoqian tried stealing my phone last Saturday. Good thing I caught her—otherwise your… collection might’ve gone public.”

Though Liu Shuowei’s face remained impassive, Guan Yu pressed: “Don’t worry—I’ve backed everything up. Even if the phone’s taken, your secrets are safe… with me.”

Setting down his chopsticks, Liu Shuowei admitted defeat. “When did you figure it out? I underestimated you.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Wang Xiaoqian’s your pawn. You had her befriend Wei Hongwei to get close to me. A clumsy scheme.”

Cornered, Liu Shuowei pleaded, “I had no choice! The principal prefers young students! The prostitutes didn’t satisfy him! Please—give me another chance!”

Xue Jing listened in disgusted fascination. Guan Yu slid a document across the table. “Complete this task, and I’ll reconsider. Clean up the Wang Xiaoqian mess too—if Wei Hongwei gets hurt, you’ll pay.”

After Liu Shuowei slunk away, Xue Jing frowned. “Why spare him? A dog can’t stop eating dung!”

Guan Yu sipped water. “Cornered beasts attack. Leave them an escape, and they’ll obey. Besides—he’s a Third-Rank Psychic. Useful.”

Back in class, Guan Yu debated telling Wei Hongwei the truth. The lovesick youth would be devastated. Let Liu Shuowei handle his own mess.

During their beautiful homeroom teacher Pan Xiaoxia’s lesson, Guan Yu noticed something odd—while male students drooled, she kept glancing his way. Unlike others, he never ogled her.

Lü Mei, noticing the attention, teased, “Guan Yu, our teacher seems fond of you!”

Ignoring her days-long cold shoulder, Guan Yu muttered, “Mosquitoes in daylight? How strange.”

Lü Mei slammed her book down. “Are you even a man? Holding grudges over trifles!”

The outburst drew the teacher’s gaze. Guan Yu sighed theatrically. “Modern women—so self-important. True ladies grow scarce.”

Enraged, Lü Mei stormed out as the class watched. Guan Yu simply smiled—this game of wits was far from over.
