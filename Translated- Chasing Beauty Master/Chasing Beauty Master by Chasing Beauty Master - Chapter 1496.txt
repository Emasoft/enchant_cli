“Everyone, let’s eat together. Otherwise, I won’t be able to finish all this by myself,” said Wang Xiaorong. Yet no one had an appetite at the moment.

Wang Xiaorong had always eaten sparingly. Faced with such a lavish spread, she took only a few bites before declaring herself full. In the end, she insisted on sharing a room with Guan Yu. No one objected—and of course, Guan Yu couldn’t refuse either. After all, Wang Xiaorong had come all this way for him in the dead of night.

Early the next morning, Wang Xiaorong rose promptly, tidied her belongings, freshened up, and then led Guan Yu to the Demonic Soul Sect’s outpost.

The Left Envoy had anticipated the Young Mistress’s visit and had been waiting there leisurely sipping tea.

**Chapter 3,899: Hold Your Tongue**

Approaching him, Wang Xiaorong said, “Left Envoy, I need your help with something.”

“Speak. I’ve been waiting here for you,” replied the Left Envoy, casting a glance at Guan Yu. He surmised it was Guan Yu who had sought Wang Xiaorong’s aid, prompting her to approach him.

Yet in the Left Envoy’s view, Guan Yu was a man of considerable capability. He wondered what trouble the latter had stumbled into that even the Demonic Soul Sect’s assistance was required.

The Left Envoy continued, “Young Mistress, this is Guan Yu’s matter, isn’t it? If word spreads that a disciple of the Cloud Azure Sect sought help from our Demonic Soul Sect, wouldn’t that stir quite the amusing rumor?”

“What do you mean by that?” Guan Yu interjected coldly. “If you’re unwilling to help, so be it. I’ll find another way. But let me make this clear—this isn’t my personal affair. I’ve never relied on others to solve my problems, let alone sought the Demonic Soul Sect’s aid.”

Disgusted by the Left Envoy’s tone, Guan Yu turned to leave, adding as he walked away, “Xiaorong, I’ll handle this myself. No need to trouble your sect’s lofty members. We humble folk dare not impose.”

“Guan Yu, wait! I never said I wouldn’t help!” Wang Xiaorong cried out in panic, scrambling after him with flailing arms.

The Left Envoy rose to his feet. “Young Mistress, please maintain your dignity. Our sect has never meddled in outsiders’ affairs. Surely you know this.”

“Shut your mouth! Must you always speak?” Wang Xiaorong jabbed a finger at his face, livid. “I’ve no time for your lectures today. We’ll settle this later. Though I’ve always respected you, you’ve overstepped. Learn to hold your tongue henceforth!”

For all his authority within the Demonic Soul Sect, the Left Envoy remained subordinate. Wang Xiaorong, though usually carefree and mischievous, now genuinely feared losing Guan Yu’s regard.

Her rare fury startled the Left Envoy. He hadn’t seen her this enraged in years. Realizing the consequences of provoking her wrath—knowing full well that offending the Young Mistress outweighed even angering the Sect Master—he paled.

His intentions had been noble: to protect her from unnecessary risks. Yet her explosive reaction stunned him. After the tongue-lashing, Wang Xiaorong stormed off after Guan Yu, leaving the Left Envoy and nearby sect members gaping in disbelief. To the junior disciples present, witnessing their mighty Left Guardian being publicly berated by a girl was unthinkable.

Wang Xiaorong charged onward without a backward glance. Though the Left Envoy seethed inwardly, he knew better than to provoke her further. His only recourse now was swift damage control.

Spotting Wang Jun nearby, the Left Envoy beckoned him over. Wang Jun, who’d been preparing to follow Guan Yu, approached warily.

“Left Envoy, you wished to inquire about something?”

“Indeed. What exactly does Guan Yu require of the Young Mistress?”

Wang Jun bowed. “Honored Left Envoy, I lack full details, but can relay what I know. During our passage through the last town, we uncovered a slave trafficking ring colluding with local officials. As martial practitioners avoid entanglement with authorities, Guan Yu seeks someone influential to persuade the Provincial Governor to dispatch troops. That’s the essence.”

“So trivial?” The Left Envoy arched an eyebrow.

“Precisely. But urgency compels him. He needs someone whose word carries weight with the Governor, as we lack concrete evidence. The operation requires simultaneous investigation and arrests.”

“Understood. You may go.” The Left Envoy tossed him a pill—an antidote for Wang Jun’s lingering Blood Poison. “This should tide you over.”

Gratefully pocketing the life-extending remedy, Wang Jun withdrew.

**Chapter 3,900: A New Identity**

Alone, the Left Envoy pondered. To appease the Young Mistress’s temper—known to outlast even the Sect Master’s patience—he must act swiftly.

Summoning the outpost’s aging Incense Master, he demanded, “Your name?”

“This lowly one serves under Hall Master Lai. He promoted me for modest competence. You may call me Old Servant.”

“Are you familiar with the Provincial Governor’s office?”

“Reasonably so, Honored Left Envoy. I’ve been stationed here three years.”

“Good. You’ll accompany me to visit the Governor. Bring gifts.”

“Respectfully, Honored Left Envoy, direct approach may raise suspicion. Let me pose as a tea merchant. You as my attendant?”

“Unthinkable! You’d have me play servant?”

“Merely a disguise! You as the merchant, I your humble aide.”

After haggling, they settled on the Left Envoy posing as subordinate. Donning opulent robes, Old Servant led the way to the government office.

At the gates, guards ushered them into the main hall—a calculated snub, as officials typically received guests privately. Undeterred, the Left Envoy addressed the long-faced Governor flanked by twenty guards:

“Your Excellency, slave traders collude with Magistrate Pang and the Li family in southern towns. I witnessed this myself.”

The Governor stroked his beard. “Serious accusations. Where’s your proof?”

“Dispatch investigators. I’ll provide evidence on-site.”

Though skeptical, the Governor agreed to send men. Mission accomplished, the Left Envoy departed, instructing Old Servant: “Inform the Young Mistress the matter is settled.”

His duty discharged, he sighed. Only for Wang Xiaorong would he stoop to such theatrics. Let Guan Yu handle the rest.
