Such a figure, paired with childlike pajamas, exuded a charm only Guan Yu himself could truly appreciate.

Freshly risen and washed, he was about to invite Niu Le for breakfast downstairs when Luo Cheng arrived with a group of Speedy Riders Gang brothers.

“Brother Yu, what’s the plan today?” Luo Cheng, meticulous as ever, had bought breakfast for all three. Placing the food on the coffee table, he sidled up to Guan Yu with a grin.

“Nothing particular. Just wandering around… Why? Got something in mind?”

“Nah, but spend the day with us! Let’s go wild—how about it?” Luo Cheng raised an eyebrow, though his bloodshot eyes betrayed a sleepless night of restless anticipation. The promise Guan Yu had made about the gang’s future had kept him tossing and turning, his mind ablaze with visions of a thrilling path ahead.

Guan Yu narrowed his eyes skeptically. “Quit beating around the bush. Spit it out—what’s the scheme?”

“Brother Yu sees right through everything!” Luo Cheng slapped his thigh, laughing as he settled beside Guan Yu. “Here’s the deal: after the brothers discussed last night, we figured if we want to grow stronger, we need our own business, a solid foundation. On our turf, there’s a KTV, a dance club, and a small restaurant—three adjacent shops up for sale. Let’s check them out today!”

Guan Yu studied Luo Cheng’s eager face and nodded. “Alright. Let’s take a look.”

He understood the gang’s excitement. Having scraped by at the bottom of Nanjing’s underworld, they’d never made a real name for themselves. Collecting protection fees from shops was one thing, but when trouble arose, they risked their lives for meager returns. Reputation mattered little in their line of work—without wealth or influence, survival was a daily grind.

In contrast, established gangs operated smoothly, their members managing venues without financial worries, their power deterring conflicts. If Guan Yu had promised to elevate the Speedy Riders, he’d see it through. After breakfast, the group marched out of the hotel like a small army.

A roaring procession of over a dozen motorcycles snaked through the streets, engines thundering. Riding with Du Xiaojuan, Guan Yu felt his spirit swell with pride.

### Chapter 179: Eloping With Her?

The spectacle drew stares and whispers from passersby, but Guan Yu paid no mind. Youth was meant for boldness, and he saw no shame in their display.

Dismounting, he removed his helmet and surveyed the three closed venues—only the adjacent restaurant was open, its staff cleaning up.

“Too early,” Luo Cheng groaned, recalling most entertainment spots opened in the afternoon.

“No matter. Let’s scope it out.” Guan Yu led the group inside the modest two-story restaurant.

Over a casual meal, they discussed plans. “Why target this place? Will it thrive?” Guan Yu asked.

“Combine all three—create a one-stop hub for fun!” Luo Cheng explained earnestly.

The estimated cost: three to four million for the properties, plus over a million for renovations. Though unfamiliar with such ventures, Guan Yu trusted the gang’s zeal. “If it checks out, we’ll take it.”

Money, after all, was meant to flow.

After a day inspecting the sites, Guan Yu acquiesced despite lingering doubts. “Transfer the funds tomorrow. Handle the details.”

“But Brother Yu, these properties must be under your name! They’re yours—we’re just your crew,” Luo Cheng insisted.

“Enough formalities. Keep the brothers fed and busy—that’s what matters.” Guan Yu waved him off, exiting the club.

The gang marveled at his trust and generosity. With such a leader, prosperity seemed assured.

### Chapter 180: Won’t You Marry Me?

The next morning, Guan Yu accompanied Luo Cheng to the bank. Afterward, as he pondered his next move with Niu Le and Du Xiaojuan, his phone rang.

“Guan Yu? Where are you?” Liu Shilei’s voice trembled slightly.

“Out. What’s wrong, Shilei-jie?”

Her tone wavered. “It’s been days. Why haven’t you returned? Are you… eloping with her?”

“What? No!”

“Du Xiaojuan’s family stormed the school, demanding answers. They nearly called the police!”

Guan Yu froze. Her family had tracked them down?

“You can’t vanish forever. Figure this out,” Liu Shilei urged, her voice tinged with loneliness.

“I dropped out to protect you from the scandal—”

“That’s past! Come back. Unless… you’re choosing her over me?”

“Never!” Guan Yu protested. “I’ll see you tonight.”

“Now. I’m at the school gate.”

At the bustling campus entrance, Liu Shilei emerged in a sleek black skirt suit, heels clicking. Guan Yu’s chest warmed at her elegance—this stunning woman, his former teacher, now entwined with him in secrecy.

Ignoring curious stares, she linked arms with him. “Walk with me.”

“Aren’t you worried about gossip?”

“Should I be?” She tilted her head, smiling.

As they strolled, she probed gently. “Living with Du Xiaojuan now?”

He nodded. Her face paled.

“What next? Drifting forever? What will you offer her family?”

“I’ll manage,” he deflected.

“Manage?” Her voice sharpened. “Without stability, how will you win their approval?”

Guan Yu blinked, realization dawning. Did she think he’d marry Du Xiaojuan?

“You’re misunderstanding—”

“Am I?” She stopped, eyes glistening. “Then prove it. Choose.”

Under the weight of her gaze, Guan Yu faltered. Two women, two paths—his heart, yet uncertain, teetered on the edge of duty and desire.
