Guan Yu was momentarily stunned by her gaze. The way this young woman looked at him made him somewhat nervous, for he recognized that particular expression all too well. Yet he deliberately maintained distance from Jiang Xin, knowing she was Chu Fan’s woman. Loyalty came first in Guan Yu’s heart.

Jiang Xin fixed her eyes on him and asked earnestly, “Young Master Wan Hong, I want the truth. When I was rescued—though my consciousness was hazy—I sensed it was you who first appeared to save me when Cao Di tried to assault me. Am I right?”

Guan Yu met her gaze but remained silent. Though her words held truth, he had no intention of acknowledging it. The entire capital, even the imperial court, believed Crown Prince Da Huang had rescued Jiang Xin. Guan Yu wished to stay entirely unconnected to the matter, as the credit had been intentionally ceded to the Crown Prince.

He had assumed Jiang Xin shared this belief—that her gratitude should lie elsewhere. Yet despite her near-unconscious state, she had discerned her true savior. This complication was troublesome.

Now, faced with her direct questioning, Guan Yu found himself cornered. Revealing the truth risked undermining the Crown Prince’s hard-won favor with the Emperor.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m here. I’ll take you home.” Jiang Xin suddenly repeated those words, shifting the atmosphere around them.

Tears welled in her luminous eyes, trembling like crystal dewdrops. That single phrase had etched itself into her soul—a lifeline pulled from death’s threshold, radiating warmth and safety. She knew she would carry this memory forever, Guan Yu’s vow imprinted deeper than any nightmare.

Unable to bear her piercing gaze, Guan Yu lowered his head. Her eyes held an intensity that unsettled him—sharp yet heartbreaking.

“Your silence is answer enough.” Tears cascaded down her cheeks as her voice fractured. “Even if you deny it, I know it was you. Those words… I’ll never forget…”

Guan Yu realized denial was futile. Her stubborn certainty left no room for lies without causing deeper hurt.

“Yes,” he admitted, stepping forward with a white handkerchief to gently wipe her tears. “I rescued you from that cellar in the ruined temple. This isn’t about deceiving you. The credit serves no purpose for me, but for the Crown Prince—it’s vital. Please understand.”

**Chapter 4996: Of Course It’s Different**

Jiang Xin finally grasped the situation. “You could gift this merit to others, but to me—it’s personal! Did any of you consider my feelings?”

Her voice broke as she recalled Cao Di’s assault. “When he attacked me, the world turned gray. I only wished to die. But your words—‘I’ll take you home’—became my anchor. They pulled me through nightmares, gave me strength. Everyone praises the Crown Prince, but I know it was you.”

She met his eyes squarely. “I’ve no ulterior motive in asking—only to thank you properly.”

“There’s no need for formalities, Lady Jiang.” Guan Yu inclined his head. “As Chu Fan’s sworn brother and your father’s friend, aiding you was natural. The Crown Prince requires this political capital more than I. Please keep this secret.”

“I refuse!” She snatched his handkerchief, dabbing her cheeks. “I’ll petition His Majesty to correct this falsehood. That promise was yours—not some borrowed glory!”

Panic flared in Guan Yu. If she exposed the truth, the Emperor’s renewed favor toward the Crown Prince would crumble. “Lady Jiang, let’s discuss—”

“Enough with ‘Lady Jiang’!” she interjected. “If you’re Chu Fan’s brother and my father’s friend, call me Jiang Xin. This formality pains me.”

“As you wish,” he acquiesced politely, though mindful of her noble status.

“Why cling to this settled matter?” he pressed.

Her tears had dried, replaced by stubborn resolve. “You don’t treat me as a friend, so why should I comply? I’ll inform His Majesty unless…” A sly glint surfaced. “...you meet two conditions.”

**Chapter 4997: Constant Tribulations**

“Two conditions?” Guan Yu warily echoed, sensing a trap.

“First,” Jiang Xin began, “why aid the Crown Prince? You’re not close.”

“My allegiance lies with Prince Zou,” Guan Yu admitted. “Assisting the Crown Prince serves his faction.”

Nodding, she posed her second query: “Would you accept a high-ranking position if I secured it?”

“Never.” His refusal was immediate. “I value freedom over titles—even a prince’s crown.”

Her lips pursed at this echo of Chu Fan’s past response. Where her beloved had declined for ambition’s sake, Guan Yu’s rejection stemmed from different principles.

Blushing faintly, she ventured deeper. “Your wives—do they coexist peacefully? No jealousy?”

“Those prone to envy don’t enter my life,” he stated plainly.

The fatal question came: “Do you… care for me?”

Guan Yu stiffened. Flattery would mislead; honesty might wound. “Any man would admire Jiang Xin, peerless beauty of the capital. But between Chu Fan and propriety—we’re fated as friends. Nothing more.”

**Chapter 4998: A Simple Matter**

Jiang Xin stood motionless, heart in turmoil. Though young, she recognized her conflicted feelings—the simultaneous pull toward Chu Fan’s steadfast devotion and Guan Yu’s enigmatic integrity.

Chu Fan had been her first love, his ambition a comforting constant. Yet Guan Yu’s shadow increasingly encroached upon that space. She recalled watching him playfully interact with Qiqi and Wang Xiaorong earlier, an unexpected pang of envy twisting her thoughts.

“Very well,” she finally said, masking her turmoil. “My first condition: cease this ‘Lady Jiang’ pretense. The second…” A mischievous smile surfaced. “Attend tomorrow’s lantern festival with me—as friends.”

Relief washed over Guan Yu. “Easily done.”

“Then it’s settled.” Jiang Xin turned, hiding her bittersweet smile. Some truths, she resolved, were better left unspoken—for now. The game had merely begun.
