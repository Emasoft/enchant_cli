Before reaching the rockery, Guan Yu spotted Steward Sun pacing around it from afar. He wondered why the steward was always lingering there – could this ornamental hill hold some secret?

Determining not to alert the man, Guan Yu quietly approached. Upon drawing nearer, he noticed Steward Sun holding pruning shears yet making no pretense of gardening. The steward rhythmically tapped different spots on the rockery, listening intently like one testing watermelons for ripeness.

Intrigued, Guan Yu observed the steward's grave concentration. This wasn't mere landscaping – Steward Sun clearly harbored deeper motives beyond his role as Qin Manor's caretaker. Guan Yu resolved to investigate this matter thoroughly later.

"Guan Yu! What are you doing?"

The sudden call startled Guan Yu into adopting a martial arts stance. Turning, he found Siqi standing there. Steward Sun jumped in alarm too, hurriedly pretending to trim foliage with his shears.

"Oh! Siqi, you're up early," Guan Yu said, feigning nonchalance despite his racing heart. "Just getting some exercise." He needed to maintain appearances – if the steward sensed their suspicion, catching him off-guard would prove difficult.

"I woke early with nothing to do," Siqi replied, joining him. "Any recent developments?"

"Chapter 3,471: Mind Your Words"

"Must you startle people like that?" Siqi complained.

Guan Yu chuckled. "A tomb? Unlikely, though your imagination does you credit."

Their conversation was interrupted by Aze's arrival. "Anyone else hungry? Breakfast should be ready soon. Siqi, how's your meditation progressing?"

"Can't you see my improved complexion?"

"Indeed," Aze nodded. "Your cultivation advances show. I spent last night absorbing spiritual energy from the Merit Cauldron. Multiple techniques revealed themselves."

"Truly? How potent?" Xiao Zhi leaned forward eagerly.

"Still assimilating," Aze replied. "But during my vigil, I heard strange noises in the courtyard..."

A collective shiver ran through the group. "Must we discuss this?" Siqi protested.

Guan Yu proposed moving to his quarters. Once settled, Xiao Zhi pressed Aze: "What exactly did you hear?"

"Have you heard a fox's cry?" Aze's question chilled the room. Siqi wavered between fear and curiosity.

Guan Yu described the vulpine call's distinctive timbre as uneasy glances darted about.

"Exactly!" Aze confirmed. "Last night's sounds matched those I heard in Cloudgreen Sect's hinterlands. But foxes here in the city? Unnatural."

"Perhaps someone keeps one as a pet?" Siqi suggested.

Xiao Zhi shook his head. "The stench deters urban keepers. Are you certain, Aze?"

"Utterly. When I investigated..." Aze paused dramatically before bursting into laughter. "I found Steward Sun skulking by the rockery! You should see your faces!"

"You jester!" Xiao Zhi threw a mock punch. "But why would he roam at night?"

Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi exchanged glances. Their earlier suspicions about daytime prowling now extended to nocturnal activities. Could the rockery conceal vulpine spirits?

"Keep this amongst ourselves," Guan Yu cautioned. "Tonight, we'll stake out Aze's room – closest to the rockery. Let's unmask this mystery."

Siqi protested: "Steward Sun's been kind. Must we suspect him?"

Guan Yu smoothed her hair. "Your kindness is virtue, but caution preserves it. His behavior warrants scrutiny."

Xiao Zhi added grimly: "Recall Minister Chen? The previous steward who mysteriously vanished after delivering silver? I've traced his disappearance to Steward Sun's arrival."

"Chapter 3,472: Reunion After Years"

"Chen's dead?" Aze gasped.

"Likely," Xiao Zhi confirmed. "Steward Sun's ambitions exceed stewardship. The rockery holds his secret."

Their conspiracy was interrupted by a maid summoning them to breakfast. Approaching the dining hall, Guan Yu froze – approaching them was none other than the drunken lout from Echo Pavilion!

"Brother Qin! Long time!" Xiao Zhi hailed Qin Taijin warmly. Guan Yu cringed inwardly – he'd slapped this very man last night!

Qin yawned, massaging his temples. "Cousin! Heard you arrived. Years since we..." His words trailed off as he noticed Siqi. The lecherous gleam returned, though more restrained than last night's drunken antics.

"May I present my sect siblings: Guan Yu, Aze, and Siqi." Xiao Zhi's introduction made Qin's eyes linger hungrily on the latter.

"Milady," Qin oozed, pulling out a chair. "Honor us with your presence."

Siqi remained impassive. Guan Yu intercepted, steering her to a common seat. "We guests shouldn't presume." His grip tightened protectively.

At the table, Madam Qin fussed over her son's haggard appearance. Qin's assurances about showing Xiao Zhi around town rang hollow – his gaze kept drifting to Siqi.

"Chapter 3,473: Bear the Consequences"

When Qin tried guiding Siqi to the patriarch's gilded seat, Guan Yu intervened again. "We'll sit here." He positioned himself as shield between predator and prey.

Undeterred, Qin leaned close, drinking in Siqi's jade complexion. His wandering eyes dipped toward her neckline. "No need for formality, fair one..."

Guan Yu's hand shot out, yanking Siqi aside. "We humble guests know our place." His glare promised retribution should Qin persist.

The tension thickened like congealing broth. As breakfast commenced, Guan Yu's mind raced – between the rockery's secrets and this new threat to Siqi, vigilance would prove crucial. Tonight's stakeout couldn't come soon enough.
