“Lü Mei? You came with Guan Yu?” Yang Conghan’s voice carried a faint hint of jealousy she couldn’t fully suppress. She felt she held no authority or standing by Guan Yu’s side, having been “gifted” to him as part of a transactional arrangement. Thus, she believed she had no right to question his choices.

“Uh, yes. Guan Yu picked me up from home,” Lü Mei replied, tightening her grip on Guan Yu’s arm.

Guan Yu could sense the rivalry simmering between the two women. Best to separate them soon. Lü Mei’s insistence on mentioning his initiative to fetch her only stoked Yang Conghan’s visible irritation. Yet Guan Yu couldn’t openly favor either without escalating tensions.

“Let’s head inside. It’s chaotic out here,” Guan Yu suggested. Before he could finish, Yang Conghan interjected, “Guan Yu, stay with me. These excessive bodyguards are obstructive. Having you nearby would make me feel safer.”

“That won’t do,” Lü Mei protested. “If Guan Yu accompanies you, what about my safety? You at least have bodyguards. I came without any!” Guan Yu felt another headache brewing.

Previously, he’d blamed his headaches on Lan Yu. Now it was clear the issue wasn’t Lan Yu—it was himself.

“Enough,” Guan Yu sighed. “I have VIP box tickets. We’ll all go together.”

“But even the largest box can’t fit Yang Conghan’s army of bodyguards,” Lü Mei countered, determined to monopolize Guan Yu’s attention without Yang Conghan’s intrusion.

Yang Conghan, however, wasn’t one to back down. Though her position with Guan Yu was transactional, she fought for her place. “I’ll dismiss my bodyguards. Guan Yu alone can protect me. It’s settled. Let’s go.” She seized Guan Yu’s other arm and ordered her entourage to wait outside. Guan Yu puzzled over her need for such a retinue when her martial prowess surpassed most. Perhaps as a千金大小姐 (heiress), public decorum forbade her from personal displays of strength.

The trio became an instant spectacle—Guan Yu flanked by Kaihuang Academy’s campus belle and A City’s top beauty. Paparazzi swarmed, cameras flashing. Now Guan Yu understood Yang Conghan’s bodyguards: they weren’t for protection but to bulldoze through the media horde. One couldn’t reasonably pummel every reporter blocking the path.

Guan Yu’s phone rang—Wei Hongwei calling. Having already received adjacent VIP tickets, Wei eagerly awaited their arrival. “Brother Guan, when are you getting here? I’m already at the entrance.”

“On my way.”

“I’ll wait for you here.”

Escorted by the two beauties, Guan Yu entered Bridge Stadium. The charity concert, headlined by pop icon A-Mei, was a grand affair broadcasted nationwide.

In a hospital room, Young Master Feng lay with his left leg suspended in a cast, watching the live broadcast. The screen suddenly cut to breaking news: “A City’s two prominent heiresses seen arm-in-arm with a mysterious man!” The footage showed Lü Mei and Yang Conghan clinging to Guan Yu. Feng slammed his fist into the mattress. “Father! That’s the bastard who broke my leg! You must avenge me!”

Feng Zhichen stood bedside, placating his son. “He’ll pay. A limb for a limb.” Privately, he calculated: anyone daring to humiliate the Fengs while courting two powerful families must have formidable backing. Recent rumors linked Guan Yu to the legendary Jiezun Relic that cured Yang Conghan’s father—a connection requiring investigation.

At the stadium, VIP boxes proved to be well-appointed temporary structures near the stage. The ordinary stands overflowed with fans—testament to A-Mei’s star power. Even Guan Yu, indifferent to celebrities, found himself captivated by the electric atmosphere.

As the concert commenced, two colossal banners unfurled: “Tonight’s Songs Are Only for Guan Yu” and “Guan Yu, My Love!” The crowd erupted. A-Mei emerged in a spotlight, launching into a soulful ballad that entranced even Guan Yu. Beside him, both women swayed enraptured.

In his hospital bed, Feng seethed. “Madman!” he barked at a subordinate. “Gather every thug you can! Sabotage that concert—especially Guan Yu!” Soon, over a hundred disguised “beggars” stormed the stadium, overwhelming security.

Chaos erupted as the mob surged toward the stage. Guan Yu subdued one infiltrator, demanding, “Who sent you?” The man confessed Feng’s involvement. After dispatching the troublemaker, Guan Yu instructed Yang Conghan to guard Lü Mei and leapt onto the stage.

Seizing A-Mei’s microphone, Guan Yu addressed the crowd: “These disruptors were sent by the Fengs to dishonor A-Mei!” The audience turned vigilante, overwhelming Feng’s men. Within minutes, most intruders were ejected—many trampled in the frenzy.

As police secured the venue, Feng celebrated prematurely until reports revealed his forces’ decimation. With his henchmen arrested and the concert canceled, Feng faced his father’s wrath. Meanwhile, Guan Yu remained backstage with A-Mei and the heiresses as authorities processed the crowd.

The aftermath left Bridge Stadium deserted by 2 AM, its exits guarded by police checking IDs. Inside a makeshift dressing room, Guan Yu kept vigil over A-Mei, flanked by Lü Mei and Yang Conghan—a silent standoff persisting into the night.
