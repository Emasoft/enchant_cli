Xuanming nodded in agreement. In truth, Guanyu had no desire to go; he only wished to quietly cultivate his magical arts and enhance his spiritual power within the Cloud Azure Sect. Yet with greater ability came greater responsibilities, and now even trivial matters required his involvement.

That evening, many disciples gazed at Guanyu with pity after hearing the news. The Sect Master, as punishment, had confiscated all his magical artifacts—an unusually severe penalty.

“Xiao Zhi, have you heard? The Sect Master confiscated Guanyu's magical artifacts!” Aze rushed in shouting.

“Impossible! What for?” Xiao Zhi exclaimed. “I just received word that the four of us are departing tomorrow morning. Would the Sect Master really strip him of his tools now?”

“The news came from Tigerhead Peak. How could it be false?”

“Then let’s find Guanyu for answers. If needed, we’ll beg the Sect Master for leniency.”

“Agreed. Let’s go now.”

Word of the confiscation spread swiftly. Upon hearing it in his quarters, Senior Brother Qi grinned maliciously. “Serves him right! Hah! I hoped Master would punish him, but seizing his treasures outright? Now let’s see how Guanyu struts without them!”

The news soon reached Siqi at Convergence Peak. As she detailed the events of Blackblood Ridge to Seat Master Dai, a disciple interrupted:

“Master, Tigerhead Peak reports Guanyu was punished for misconduct. The Sect Master confiscated his artifacts.”

“What? Guanyu committed no error! Why punish him so harshly?” Siqi cried.

Seat Master Dai waved a hand. “Compose yourself, Siqi. Lately, any news of Guanyu unsettles you.”

**Chapter 3405: Championing Justice**

Siqi acknowledged her lapse but resolved to confront the Sect Master. “This injustice cannot stand.”

Seat Master Dai pondered. “It defies reason. Tomorrow you depart for Treasure Mountain—a perilous mission. Weakening Guanyu now is unwise.”

“Could this be a ruse?” Siqi ventured. “The Sect Master favors Guanyu. Confiscation seems unlikely—there must be deeper intent.”

Reassured, Siqi dismissed the disciple. Alone with Seat Master Dai, she observed, “The news appears genuine... yet meant for others’ ears.”

“Precisely,” Dai agreed. “Demonic spies infest our sect. After Guanyu’s targeting last mission, this rumor might protect him.”

Nodding, Siqi excused herself. “With your leave, Master, I’ll rest for tomorrow’s journey.”

At Tigerhead Peak, Guanyu returned to find two empty wine jars and Second-to-Wolf snoring thunderously. He sighed, preparing for bed when knocks interrupted.

“Guanyu! Are you there?”

Recognizing Xiao Zhi and Aze, he opened the door. “We depart at dawn. Why aren’t you resting?”

“They took your artifacts? Let’s demand justice!” Xiao Zhi urged.

Guanyu hesitated—the deception targeted sect spies, but explaining risked exposure. “Only the Furnace of Heaven’s Blaze was taken. It mattered little to me.”

Aze sighed in relief, but Xiao Zhi fumed. “Unacceptable! We risk our lives for the sect, only to be robbed? Let’s protest!”

“Peace,” Guanyu calmed them. “I surrendered it willingly. Without artifacts, I’ll draw less attention abroad. Publicly, all three were seized—but you alone know the truth. Tell no one. Let the spies believe it.”

“Understood!” Xiao Zhi vowed, though Guanyu eyed his loose tongue warily. By dawn, they’d be gone—curbing gossip.

**Chapter 3406: Preparations**

At daybreak, the group assembled at Front Return Peak. Guanyu now wielded sword flight—crossing Beamless Bridge airborne with comrades.

Seat Master Lu bid farewell: “Prioritize safety over duty. Lives outweigh missions.”

Guanyu warmed to these words—unlike Xuanming’s relentless demands. After bows of respect, they departed.

Reaching Perch Town outskirts by dusk, they dismounted to avoid aerial spectacle. “Secure horses and lodge here,” Guanyu decided, awaiting Second-to-Wolf’s landbound pursuit.

At dinner, Xiao Zhi enthused, “This night-market thrives after dark! Let’s explore.”

Guanyu smirked, knowing their true interests. Aze invited, “Join us, Guanyu?”

“Aren’t you weary?” Siqi chided. “Rest for tomorrow’s journey.”

“A stroll refreshes,” Guanyu countered. “Join me, Siqi? The inn’s solitude stifles.”

Surprised by his invitation, she acquiesced. Xiao Zhi proposed separating: “We seek hot springs—unsuited for ladies.”

Post-meal, the pairs diverged. Siqi veiled her beauty—a precaution against lecherous nobles.

The night-market dazzled under oil lamps. Vendors hawked perch at bargain prices, trafficked by merchants for resale elsewhere.

“How tedious,” Siqi mused, “to sell fish nightly, year-round.”

“Commerce demands it,” Guanyu replied. “In my homeland, holidays bring frenzy—no rest for merchants.”

“Strange customs,” she murmured, longing to glimpse his origins.

**Chapter 3407: Foiling Thieves**

“Stop! Thief!”

A youth dashed past, pursued by a stumbling merchant. Guanyu helped the man rise. “My coin purse! Please!”

Chasing through crowds, Guanyu and Siqi cornered the thief outside town. A sleeping beggar and coffin-filled hut loomed ahead.

Inside the shack, three men divided spoils. Guanyu burst in, subduing them effortlessly. “Return what you stole.”

“Mercy! We starved!”

“Earn honest livings,” Guanyu warned, reclaiming the purse. But the victim had vanished.

“Keep it till we meet him again,” Siqi advised.

At dawn, the quartet rode hard toward Xiao Zhi’s uncle.

Meanwhile, at the Demon Soul Sect, the Demon Lord and Left Envoy played chess beneath fair skies. “Fine weather,” the Lord remarked, moving a piece.
