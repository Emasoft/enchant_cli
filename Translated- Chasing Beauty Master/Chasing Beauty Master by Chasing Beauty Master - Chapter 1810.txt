“Of course I haven’t figured it out yet. It’s not that simple,” Guan Yu said with a frustrated expression. “Besides, this is still just my speculation. I need to find the right opportunity to test Xiaotong. Then I’ll know if she’s really hiding Senior Brother Qi.”

Siqi nodded. “Guan Yu, you must be extremely careful. We absolutely cannot let Master or the Sect Leader find out about this.”

“Don’t worry. Once I confirm it, I’ll handle everything. Don’t you trust my capabilities?” As he spoke, Guan Yu’s hands began wandering mischieously.

Their conversation continued until they reached Guan Yu’s room. When Siqi moved to fetch water for his ablutions, Guan Yu suddenly pulled her into his lap.

“Wait a moment—let me get your washing water,” Siqi protested breathlessly.

“Don’t you think we should find something more... entertaining to do?” Guan Yu whispered in Siqi’s ear, his warm breath making her shiver.

“What... what kind of entertainment?” Siqi’s voice trembled as her body temperature rose. She knew exactly what he implied. As a man, Guan Yu saw no shame in taking initiative.

Though flustered, Siqi couldn’t deny her own longing. She realized Guan Yu had feigned drunkenness to bring her here—a perfect opportunity she’d secretly desired. Despite her weakened resolve, she insisted, “You reek of alcohol. Let me fetch water to clean you.”

“I don’t want that,” Guan Yu declared, sweeping her into his arms. “I prefer this hazy, intoxicating feeling.” He carried her to the bed.

Meanwhile, Du Bingyan’s room buzzed with feminine laughter. While the other disciples of Juhé Peak chatted merrily, Xiaotong sat anxiously replaying Guan Yu’s earlier words. The secret about Senior Brother Qi felt like a burning coal in her chest.

She had wanted to demand answers when Siqi forcibly ejected Guan Yu earlier. Now, resignation settled in—if exposed, she’d face severe consequences. Yet she’d made her choice. Death seemed preferable to cowardice.

Dawn’s first light tinged the eastern sky when Xiaotong finally stirred from her troubled thoughts. In Du Bingyan’s quarters, preparations for the bridal procession were already underway.

“Where’s Siqi? Hasn’t she returned yet?” Xiao Lian asked, noticing Xiaotong’s distracted state.

Xiao Chun snorted before Xiaotong could reply. “Need you ask? She never came back after escorting Guan Yu last night. Where else would she be at daybreak?”

“Perhaps she... overexerted herself,” Xiao Lian giggled meaningfully.

Du Bingyan sat serenely before her dressing table, resplendent in crimson bridal robes. Servants bustled around her—arranging her phoenix crown, adjusting layers of silk.

“Should we fetch Siqi from Guan Yu’s quarters?” Xiao Chun suggested. “There’s still time before the sedan arrives.”

Xiao Lian shook her head. “Imagine catching them abed! How mortifying that would be.”

As sunlight streamed through the window, Siqi awoke to find Guan Yu still sleeping soundly beside her. Reluctant to rouse him yet mindful of the day’s importance, she shook his shoulder. “Guan Yu! The sun’s up! We’ll be late for Xiao Zhi’s wedding!”

Blinking awake, Guan Yu groaned. “You’re usually the early riser. What happened today?”

“This is your fault!” Siqi hissed, her body still throbbing from their nocturnal activities.

After hurried preparations, they arrived at Du Bingyan’s quarters where Wang Jun waited. The knowing smirk on his face confirmed their secret wasn’t hidden.

“Cutting it close, aren’t we?” Wang Jun teased. Siqi fled inside to avoid his gaze, only to face a roomful of smirking disciples.

“Where did you ‘escort’ Guan Yu last night?” Xiao Lian asked innocently. “We nearly finished without you.”

Blushing furiously, Siqi mumbled apologies before escaping outside. The distant crackle of firecrackers announced the bridal procession’s approach.

At Tiger’s Head Peak’s entrance, Guan Yu watched Xiao Zhi approach on a white stallion, resplendent in groom’s attire. “Everything’s ready!” he called through the celebratory din.

When Xiao Zhi moved to enter the bride’s chamber, Guan Yu blocked the doorway. “Not so fast! As the bride’s family, I demand proofs of your devotion!”

Laughter erupted as Guan Yu imposed traditional challenges—public declarations of love, vows of eternal fidelity, and finally a kneeling proposal outside the sealed door. Inside, Du Bingyan trembled with emotion, her tears dampening the scarlet veil.

“I swear before heaven!” Xiao Zhi’s voice boomed as he knelt. “I’ll cherish you all my days! Feel my sincerity and come to me!”

Just as the touched bride nearly rushed out, Guan Yu announced the final trial. The crowd roared with anticipation—this wedding would be remembered for generations.
