Hearing this, ripples of emotion stirred within Guan Yu’s heart. Deeply moved, he knew Allen spoke sincere words from the depths of his soul. The elder truly treated him as if he were his own child. Unbidden, Guan Yu’s thoughts drifted to his family in another world. Were they well now?

“Brother Guan Yu,” Allen continued, “I know another reason you’ve hesitated to leave. If you’re willing, you may take any one of the three girls with you—should you not find it burdensome.”

The moment these words left the clan leader’s lips, Guan Yu stiffened in astonishment. How could Allen truly part with his precious daughter? Yet after a moment’s contemplation, he couldn’t help but silently admire the elder’s shrewdness.

By offering a choice, Allen was testing Guan Yu’s affections toward the three. Moreover, taking only one *was* the wisest course—the Elven clan could not spare all three, and Guan Yu lacked the means to protect them all.

Glancing at Luo Xi, Namei, and Amy, he saw complex emotions flicker across their faces: hope that he would choose them, tinged with fear of disappointment.

After a pause, Guan Yu pointed at Amy. “I’ll take Amy.”

The girl erupted in joy before he finished speaking. “Haha! Brother Longzu (Dragon Clan), you’re truly the best!”

Allen showed little surprise, as if he’d anticipated this. Choosing either Luo Xi or Namei might have bred rivalry, but Amy’s innocence and youth had always invited sisterly protectiveness rather than envy.

*Clap clap clap.* Allen applauded, chuckling. “You’re quite the charmer, stealing away my precious daughter!”

“Forgive my boldness, Clan Leader. I promised Amy long ago to show her the world beyond. Now that you’ve granted this chance, I must honor my word.”

“Hmph. While taking her seems ideal now, remember—Luo Xi and Sha Siming are stronger in combat. They could aid you against true dangers.”

Guan Yu shook his head without hesitation. “I care not. I’ll spare no effort to protect them. They’ll never face mortal peril.”

“Fine words, but fate often defies control,” Allen countered.

Guan Yu fell silent. The elder’s reasoning was sound. Just then, Amy tugged Allen’s sleeve. “Daddy! You promised! No take-backs!”

Defeated, Allen sighed. “Very well! I merely tested his resolve. You may go.”

Amy leapt in delight, her earlier malaise vanishing. Though Luo Xi and Namei rejoiced for her, their smiles held melancholy. They yearned to follow Guan Yu but knew his ambitions transcended romantic entanglements. Clinging to him would only hinder his path.

Guan Yu resolved to spend one final night in the Elven Forest before departing. How long until his return? He couldn’t say—a wanderer’s journey obeyed no schedule. Had it been otherwise, he’d never have fallen into his current plight.

After Luo Xi and Sha Siming withdrew, Allen fixed Guan Yu with an amused stare. “Bold lad, courting trouble with such confidence in your charm! But rejecting Luo Xi and Namei so bluntly—was that fair?”

Guan Yu snorted. “Who pushed me to this, Clan Leader?”

“Heh, I knew you’d blame me. Fear not—I’ll explain matters to them after you’re gone. The clan needs them here. But swear this: protect Amy fiercely. If she returns with so much as a hair harmed, I’ll hold you accountable!”

“Rest assured,” Guan Yu vowed. “If I cannot safeguard one Amy, what right have I to speak boldly before you?”

“Well said! Were you of Elven blood, I’d name you my successor. Alas, tradition forbids it. Yet remember this: wherever your path leads, never forget the joy you found among us.”

**Chapter 1370: The Disappearance**

“I swear it. Your trust in entrusting Amy alone binds me to the Elven clan’s welfare. To betray that would make me no better than the ungrateful Locke!”

Their shared laughter faded as Allen added casually, “There’s another reason I permit this journey. Have you guessed it?”

“I confess I haven’t. Enlighten me.”

Allen’s expression sobered. “Did you never wonder how Amy recovered so swiftly from Locke’s poison?”

A cold premonition gripped Guan Yu. “You mean...?”

“I used forbidden arts to seal the toxin within her. The seal lasts six months at most. Fail to find a cure by then, and the poison will resurge... fatally.”

Guan Yu froze. So Amy’s miraculous recovery was a temporary reprieve! This explained Allen’s willingness—outside the forest, Guan Yu stood better chances of finding a cure.

“But the guard delivered Locke’s antidote!” he protested.

Allen shook his head. “A common elixir, useless against this venom.”

“Impossible! I saw it empower Locke’s transformation!”

“Speculation. Without proof, we cannot know.”

“Summon that guard! He must have tampered with it!”

Allen’s face darkened. “He vanished yesterday—a former henchman of Locke’s. My oversight, failing to purge traitors.”

“At least he didn’t substitute poison.”

“Small mercies. But how will you seek the cure? Pursue Locke?”

“Not necessarily. The world holds other remedies. Besides, trusting Locke is folly.”

“Understood. I’ll adapt as circumstances demand.”

That night, Guan Yu lay awake, the days’ events swirling like a dream. Soon, Bicat’s snores rumbled beside him. Kicking the cat off, he finally drifted into troubled sleep.

**Chapter 1371: Departure**

Dawn’s knocking startled Guan Yu awake. “Impatient girl! Let me sleep!” he called—but received no reply.

Finding no Amy outside, he dressed and entered the council hall. Allen greeted him grimly. “Leaving so early?”

“Best depart before troubles arise.”

“Then fetch Amy. She should be in her chambers.”

Puzzled—had he misheard the knocks?—Guan Yu accompanied Allen to Amy’s room. Sunlight bathed the tranquil scene: birdsong, blooming flowers, peace permeating the air.

Only now did Guan Yu truly appreciate the forest’s beauty. “Who knows when I’ll see this again?”

Knocking brought no response. Dread rising, he pushed the door open—to find the room empty, meticulously tidied.

“Where would she go?”

Allen gasped. “The hill behind the Source of Life!”

The site, unfamiliar to Guan Yu, revealed itself as a graveyard upon arrival. Fresh flowers adorned one grave—Amy’s mother’s.

The girl knelt weeping beside it. Allen whispered, “Her mother’s death anniversary approaches. Leaving meant missing it.”

“Let’s delay our journey!”

“No. Her mother’s spirit would prioritize the cure.”

Approaching, Guan Yu gently touched Amy’s shoulder. “Little one, tears steal your beauty.”

Sniffling, Amy looked up. Allen joined them, eyes glistening. “Your mother would scold us for grieving so.”

“I just miss her... so much.”

“As do I,” Allen admitted softly.

“Enough sorrow,” Guan Yu urged. “Would your mother wish this?”

Wiping her eyes, Amy asked, “When do we leave?”

“Whenever you’re ready.”

With Allen’s nod, they bid farewell at the graveside. But exiting the cemetery, they found the path lined with elves—a send-off befitting royalty.

“They come voluntarily,” Allen explained. “Amy is our princess, you our savior. Both irreplaceable.”

“Daddy, please! Your words make leaving harder.”

“Then let them see you one last time.”

As cheers surrounded them, Guan Yu glimpsed the weight of destiny ahead—a journey to save a life, bound by promises and poisoned hours.
