“If Guan Yu wished to take Jiang Xin out, it wouldn’t be difficult. Though Prince Consort Jiang’s estate had many guards, they posed no threat to Guan Yu. Successfully escaping with Jiang Xin was almost guaranteed—unless they encountered Jiang Yuankai.

Rumors claimed Jiang Yuankai was a peerless master. Guan Yu didn’t know the extent of his prowess, but if Jiang Yuankai intervened, taking Jiang Xin would be impossible.

Yet before Guan Yu could even agree, Miss Jiang had already begun mocking him. Her remark—“I’ve heard Young Master Wan Hong possesses remarkable abilities”—was clearly sarcastic.

Her meaning was plain: “If you’re so capable, Wan Hong, prove it by taking me out. Otherwise, the rumors about you are lies.”

To make matters worse, she blamed Guan Yu entirely for her predicament. This left him deeply conflicted. Helping her risked offending Jiang Yuankai, while refusing would damage his reputation. Trapped between choices, Guan Yu hesitated.

Finally, he said, “Miss Jiang, you ask too much. Your father and I are friends. Helping you defy him would betray our bond.”

“So you admit incompetence?” Miss Jiang retorted bluntly. “Is the legendary Wan Hong truly so feeble? My father claims you’re his chosen son-in-law, yet you pale beside Chu Fan. Were he here, he’d risk his life to fulfill my wish!”

“I am not Chu Fan, nor do I seek empty valor,” Guan Yu replied coolly, stung by her scorn. “Taking you out is trivial, but doing so would violate principles. I won’t indulge childish whims or betray friendships. As for rumors of betrothal—dismiss them. I’ve no claim to being your father’s chosen, nor do I rival Chu Fan in your eyes.”

“Empty boasts!” she jeered. “If you cannot act, admit weakness instead of hiding behind excuses!” The once-innocent girl now wielded ruthless provocation.

“Thank heavens those rumors are false,” she added. “Were you truly my betrothed, I’d sooner die than wed such a coward!”

Goaded past endurance, Guan Yu resolved to act. His reputation couldn’t withstand her slander. To silence her tongue and salvage pride, he’d take drastic measures.

Hearing sudden silence, Jiang Xin pressed her ear to the door. Had Wan Hong fled? Before she could ponder, two *thuds* echoed. The door swung open—

“Ah!” She screamed, startled by Guan Yu’s sudden appearance. Two guards lay unconscious at his feet as he stood gracefully, the golden lock picked effortlessly.

**Chapter 4809: Soul Startled Away**

Moments earlier, Guan Yu had incapacitated the guards with lightning strikes, their collapse causing the noises Jiang Xin heard. The intricate royal lock posed no challenge—his skills from Hua Xia could breach far stronger barriers.

Now, gazing at the stunning Jiang Xin, Guan Yu smiled. “I’ll take you out to prove my capability.”

Before she could react, he swept her into his arms, her slender waist intoxicatingly soft against him. Her natural fragrance surpassed even Wang Xiaorong, Qiqi, and Siqi’s charms. Briefly, he envied Chu Fan’s luck in winning such a beauty’s heart.

Propelling them forward at blistering speed, Guan Yu dodged patrols—sometimes swinging Jiang Xin like a weapon, her feet knocking guards aside.

“You fiend!” she shrieked, equal parts furious and terrified. Her screams pierced his ears as they burst onto the street outside the estate.

“Cease your wailing,” Guan Yu ordered, setting her down. “We’re out.”

Jiang Xin blinked in disbelief before erupting in joy. “You did it! I’ll admit your skill—though using me as a club was outrageous!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Your guards wouldn’t resent being kicked by their lady.” Secretly, he’d relished holding her, stealing touches no man had dared—her waist untouched even by her father.

“Proof delivered,” he declared. “Now I return you.” Ignoring her protests, he seized her waist again and soared skyward.

“AAAAH!” Her screams resumed as they ascended. “You monster! Too high! I’ll die!”

**Chapter 4810: Beyond Excessive**

“Open your eyes,” Guan Yu urged mid-flight. Below, guards gaped upward helplessly.

Peeking briefly, Jiang Xin paled. “Release me! I’ll plummet!”

Laughing, Guan Yu descended, discreetly savoring final caresses before depositing her trembling form on her bed. Relocking the door, he turned to face approaching footsteps—Jiang Yuankai and soldiers.

“My apologies for the disturbance,” Guan Yu bowed. “Your daughter’s taunts provoked me.”

Jiang Yuankai waved off guards, impressed despite himself. “My daughter’s willfulness is legendary. Only her mother, the princess, can curb her. You’ve my thanks for patience.”

As soldiers dispersed, Jiang Yuankai’s gaze lingered on the relocked door—a royal artifact opened effortlessly. “That lock was crafted by palace masters. How did you breach it?”

“In my homeland,” Guan Yu replied, “locks surpass even this complexity. Our artisans’ skill remains unmatched.”

Invited to tea, Guan Yu accepted, aware he’d made an enemy of Jiang Xin but perhaps gained an ally in her father. Meanwhile, behind her door, Jiang Xin seethed: “Wan Hong, I’ll make you regret this humiliation!”
