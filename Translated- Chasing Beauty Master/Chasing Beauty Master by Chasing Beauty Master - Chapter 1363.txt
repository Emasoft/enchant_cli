“How could you carry that around? Does anyone actually do that?” Guan Yu asked curiously, eyeing the exquisitely crafted water pouch adorned with intricate patterns and twin silk bows—clearly a feminine accessory.

“This pouch holds great significance. It’s a treasured heirloom from my mother, so of course I keep it close,” Wang Xiaorong replied solemnly.

Originally in the possession of the Demon Lord, this pouch had been entrusted to him by his dying wife as her final keepsake. He had safeguarded it meticulously until Wang Xiaorong came of age, when he passed it to her. Emphasizing its irreplaceable value as his wife’s sole memento, the Demon Lord had sternly warned Wang Xiaorong never to lose it.

“The water in this pitcher should have cooled by now. Why not transfer it to your pouch?” Guan Yu suggested, gesturing to the vessel on the table.

“That’s a splendid idea,” Wang Xiaorong agreed, beginning to pour. Guan Yu, however, suspected she was spinning tall tales.

While Guan Yu’s bulky water sack—over a foot long—could hold ample liquid, Wang Xiaorong’s dainty pouch seemed barely larger than a palm. The group watched skeptically as she tilted the half-empty pitcher. Yet to their astonishment, she poured every last drop into the diminutive pouch.

“Well, it’s not much, but it’ll suffice for now,” Wang Xiaorong pouted, sealing the pitcher. “We’re out of water anyway.”

“Impossible!” Guan Yu exclaimed, rushing to inspect for spills. The others shared his disbelief—how could such a tiny container hold so much?

“May I examine your pouch?” Guan Yu extended his hand.

Wang Xiaorong hesitated, her father’s warning echoing: “This pouch is your mother’s final relic. Guard it as your life. Never reveal it lightly, nor let others handle it.”

Noticing her reluctance, Guan Yu scanned the dry table and floor. “What’s wrong? Can’t I even look?”

“Father said...” she began, then steeled herself. “But for you, I’ll make an exception. Just don’t grow fond of it!” she teased, handing over the pouch.

“Rest assured, I’ve no intention of stealing cherished keepsakes,” Guan Yu chuckled.

The moment he touched it, the pouch quivered rebelliously in his grip. Wang Xiao’er, standing nearest, felt the vibrations. “What’s happening?”

“This isn’t just a pouch—it’s a sentient artifact!” Guan Yu marveled. “It resists my touch and blocks my spiritual probes. Remarkable!”

“Impossible! I’ve carried it for years without such phenomena,” Wang Xiaorong protested.

Redoubling his efforts, Guan Yu found the pouch’s defenses impenetrable. “This is no ordinary artifact—it possesses spiritual consciousness! Only high-grade magical implements exhibit such traits.”

“A treasure?” Wang Xiaorong blinked. “Father never mentioned this. He only called it Mother’s memento.”

“How could you not notice?” Guan Yu pressed.

“I rarely use it—only when missing Mother at the Demonic Soul Sect. It never shook before! What did you do?”

“The artifact itself rejects me,” Guan Yu admitted ruefully. “Apparently, I’ve been snubbed by a magical tool.”

As Wang Xiaorong toyed with the Butterfly Pouch (so named for its embroidered motifs), Guan Yu explained its true nature. “Your father likely withheld this knowledge to nurture your cultivation. Over-reliance on artifacts hinders growth. This pouch’s spiritual consciousness must willingly submit before you can command it.”

Recalling her father’s stricture against gifting her artifacts despite the sect’s vast collection, Wang Xiaorong nodded. “So this is why...”

Guan Yu continued, “The Butterfly Pouch’s legendary storage capacity for spiritual energy rivals immortal-grade tools. Paired with my Imperial Seal—which stores spells—they’d form a godly combination. Alone, they remain exceptional artifacts.”

Wang Xiaorong beamed under Guan Yu’s praise, brandishing her pouch. “No one gets ideas about my Butterfly Pouch! Hands off!”

“We’d never covet a girl’s treasure,” Guan Yu chuckled. “But guard it well—others might not be so scrupulous.”

As the group prepared to depart, Wang Xiaorong’s excitement buoyed their spirits. At the rockery’s base, a makeshift ladder led upward. Guan Yu scaled the ten-meter formation effortlessly. “Wait here—I’ll reconnoiter.”

Peering into the pitch-black shaft, he descended via rope. The stench of decay greeted him in the muddy chamber below. A narrow tunnel beckoned—the supposed path to Duobao Mountain, ten li distant.

“We’ll need to crawl,” Guan Yu reported. Xiao Zhi procured thick hemp ropes from the manor. Securing one to the ladder, Guan Yu descended first into the abyss, torchlight revealing damp stone walls.

“Careful!” Siqi called as he vanished into the gloom. The cramped passage forced them to proceed on hands and knees—an arduous journey toward distant secrets.
