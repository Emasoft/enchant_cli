“I trust your words, Yuan Shanding,” Guan Yu replied. “At the very least, you’ve proven how deeply you care for that woman outside. If you try to deceive me, Jiu Buyun will suffer the consequences.”

Just then, chaotic footsteps echoed from outside. Wang Hu barged in first, followed by members of the Yu Gang. Guan Yu ordered immediately, “Perfect timing. Bring the injured woman inside—carefully. Don’t let her die.”

Wang Hu and two others retrieved Jiu Buyun. At the sight of her pallid, barely conscious state, Yuan Shanding paled. “Buyun! Are you alright? Speak to me!” he cried.

Jiu Buyun was propped against another stone lion, her breathing labored. She managed a weak nod. “I’ll live... for now.”

Over a hundred Yu Gang members flooded the area. Wang Hu reported, “Boss, more are gathering. Wei Hongwei will bring another hundred soon. Your orders?”

Guan Yu nodded, impressed. Mobilizing so many during school hours was no small feat. “Tell Wei Hongwei to stand down. We have enough here.” Turning to Yuan Shanding, he demanded, “Your turn. Answer my questions.”

“Not until she’s treated!” Yuan Shanding insisted.

Guan Yu shook his head. “This isn’t a hospital. I have no doctors or supplies here. If she dies under my care, you’ll regret it.”

Though logical, Yuan Shanding pressed, “At least bandage her wounds!”

“Wang Hu, fetch cloth from inside for a makeshift bandage,” Guan Yu relented before fixing Yuan Shanding with a stare. “I’ve shown mercy. The faster you cooperate, the sooner she gets real treatment.”

“I’m Yuan Shanding,” the man confessed, finally recognizing the refined youth before him as the infamous Guan Yu—far from the brute he’d imagined.

“Who sent you to attack my friends?” Guan Yu probed, though he already knew.

“We’re from **Mountain Stronghold. I’m their leader.” Yuan puffed his chest, but Guan Yu’s blank stare crushed his pride. “A friend invited us—Bill Lin. We came to deal with some monks, nothing more.”

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. “How many are here? At the Feng residence?”

“Twenty here, twenty more there.”

“Your plans. All of them.”

“Bill Lin claimed capturing the monks would extort vast sums from you. We posed as travelers to ambush them... until you arrived. No further plans.”

Guan Yu smirked. “He wasn’t lying. Had you succeeded, I’d have paid dearly. But now... shall we see if Bill Lin pays to retrieve you?”

**Chapter 2819: Useless Trash**

Bill Lin’s smug voice crackled through Yuan’s phone: “Success, yes? Those bald fools were easy prey—”

“We failed,” Yuan interrupted. “Guan Yu captured us. He demands ransom.”

“WHAT?!” Bill Lin’s roar echoed as he hurled his phone. “Worthless idiots! How does Guan Yu ALWAYS win?!”

**Chapter 2820: A Generous Offer**

Back at the temple, Guan Yu outlined his terms: “I’ll spare you and heal her—top-tier care. But swear never to aid Bill Lin again. Break this, and she dies.”

Yuan hesitated, then nodded. “We’ll return to **Mountain. Just save her.”

As Jiu Buyun was carried away, Guan Yu ordered Yuan: “Call Bill Lin. Tell him you’re hostages. Let’s see how much he values you.”

When Bill Lin arrived hours later, Guan Yu greeted him with icy calm. “How generous of you to come, Bill Lin. Let’s discuss the price of loyalty...”

Throughout the negotiations, Guan Yu’s men tended to the injured monks. Bandages were replaced with proper medical supplies brought by Wei Hongwei, while witty banter lightened the tense atmosphere—though none missed how Guan Yu’s gaze never softened, his strategy unfolding like a master playwright’s final act.
