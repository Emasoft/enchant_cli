“In such a situation, Yingzi could only repeatedly apologize to Guan Yu. Truthfully, Guan Yu didn’t mind at all. After all, everyone knew what kind of person Jin Cilang (Second to Wolf) was. Though he’d acted somewhat intentionally, Guan Yu wasn’t the least bit angry.

“Brother, you’re really infuriating! Look how you’ve wrecked this place!” Yingzi complained indignantly.

Jin Cilang widened his eyes and retorted, “What’s that got to do with me? Guan Yu insisted on inviting me in! Now you’re calling me dirty? Haha, too late…”

He laughed uproariously, as if causing chaos in Guan Yu’s house had been immensely satisfying. Guan Yu teased, “I don’t care. It’s nothing serious anyway. A little cleaning will fix it. No big deal.”

**Chapter 2633: Countless Warnings**

Xue Jing had no mood for jokes. She said earnestly to Jin Cilang, “Brother Jin, when Guan Yu goes out with you this time, you must ensure his safety.”

Jin Cilang froze, baffled. “When did I say I’d go out with Guan Yu? Why would you come with me?” he asked Guan Yu.

Having not informed Jin Cilang beforehand, Guan Yu pretended to explain, “I just received news that Yingshan Gu has been located. We’ll investigate shortly. It’s your time to shine.”

“Hell yeah! If I catch that bitch, I’ll…” Jin Cilang began excitedly, but cut himself short upon noticing Yingzi’s darkening expression.

Yingzi had warned him countless times not to curse in her presence, but Jin Cilang struggled with self-control and remained incorrigible.

Deciding to save her brother’s face in front of others, Yingzi sighed, “Brother, you must protect Guan Yu. If anything happens to him, don’t you dare come back!”

Issuing her ultimatum, Yingzi glared as Jin Cilang thumped his chest. “Relax! With my skills, there’s no problem. Besides, I won’t let you become a widow!”

“Ugh! Such ominous words! You’re awful!” Yingzi retorted, stamping her foot.

“Let’s go. This time, she won’t escape,” Jin Cilang declared, itching to eliminate Yingshan Gu.

Xue Jing urged anxiously, “Guan Yu, be extremely careful!”

“Don’t worry. With Brother Jin here, I’ll be fine,” Guan Yu assured.

After leaving Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu intended to arrange a car for Jin Cilang to avoid accusations of stinginess. Surprisingly, Jin Cilang already possessed a luxury vehicle—a brand-new BMW 5 Series worth over 500,000.

“A new luxury car?” Guan Yu eyed him incredulously. “You keep whining about being broke, yet buy this? Planning to purchase a plane next?”

Jin Cilang grumbled, “I’m poorer than before! I need reliable transportation for my travels. This took years of scrimping!”

“You saved enough for this?” Guan Yu smirked slyly. “If you tried harder, you’d own a jet! Seems you’re loaded. Should I tell Yingzi?”

“Are you a man or not? I’m broke after this! Still want my help?”

“Fine, I’ll keep quiet,” Guan Yu relented. “Actually, there’s no lead on Yingshan Gu. I brought you out to meet someone you know.”

“Who’s this mystery person?”

“Jinhua. You’ve met her often.”

Nodding, Jin Cilang recalled Guan Yu’s warnings about Jinhua’s secret identity. “Let’s move then. No delays.”

Arriving at Pan Taisheng’s apartment, Jin Cilang opted to guard the car downstairs rather than intrude on Guan Yu’s reunion. “I’ll stay here. I’ll alert you if there’s danger.”

“Thanks.” Guan Yu headed upstairs.

Upon entering, Jinhua threw herself into Guan Yu’s arms. “You rogue! You never visit! I’ve missed you terribly!”

Patting her shoulder apologetically, Guan Yu explained, “Too much happened lately. With my lost cultivation and Xue Jing’s constant protection, I couldn’t get away.”

“It’s my fault,” Jinhua murmured. “I misread the Golden Dagger’s incantation, costing your powers. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t blame yourself. No one anticipated the dagger’s complexity. Let’s leave it in the past.”

Noticing her gauntness, Guan Yu asked, “Are your injuries unhealed? You look exhausted.”

Jinhua playfully thumped his chest. “Pining for you! My wounds healed, but an unknown energy lingers inside. I’ve been refining it—my cultivation has advanced!”

As an ordinary person now, Guan Yu couldn’t perceive cultivation levels, but trusted her progress.

“That’s wonderful!”

“It is, but this energy sometimes rages uncontrollably. Though harmless, the pain leaves me drained.”

“Why not absorb it completely?”

“I try, but can only handle tiny amounts daily. Any more feels explosive.”

Guan Yu puzzled over the energy’s origin—possibly residual from Pan Xiaoxia’s healing, though her energy shouldn’t be this violent. Could his own cultivation have accidentally transferred to Jinhua? Unlikely, given their incompatible energies.

Dismissing the mystery, Guan Yu changed subjects. “Have you heard of Yingshan Gu, one of the Ten Great Villains?”

**Chapter 2634: Days Pass Like Years**

Jinhua shook her head. “Yingshan Gu? I’ve heard of the Ten Villains but not her. I’m stuck here, oblivious to the world!”

Guan Yu described, “A cunning poison master who commands venomous creatures. Though weak in cultivation, her escape skills and toxins make her dangerous.”

Jinhua deduced, “You want my help against her?”

“Exactly. She’s evaded me repeatedly. As a poison user yourself, perhaps you can track her.”

Jinhua brightened. “If she’s the only poison keeper nearby, finding her through her creatures is simple. Multiple keepers complicate things.”

“Elaborate.”

“I sense potent toxins and communicate with intelligent venomous beings. Through them, I can trace their masters.”

“So spotting her creatures could lead us to her?”

“Yes! I might even claim them as my own,” Jinhua giggled.

“Perfect!” Guan Yu exclaimed. “With your help, we’ll corner her. When I find clues, I’ll summon you.”

“Take me with you!” Jinhua pleaded. “I’m suffocating here!”

Guan Yu refused. “The city’s in chaos. The Yang Family hunts actively now. If they spot you…”

“I can flee! My improved skills…”

“Yang Patriarch has reached Realm Sovereign status. Could you escape a Realm Sovereign?”

Jinhua paled. “Realm Sovereign? How?”

“Through the Realm Sovereign’s Relic. His power grows still.”

Despair clouded her face. “Then…my clan’s vengeance…”

“Patience. Opportunities arise unexpectedly. You might yet ascend similarly,” Guan Yu comforted.

Changing subjects, Jinhua asked about Yingshan Gu’s grudge. Guan Yu explained the fake treasure map theft and subsequent threats.

“At Yang’s auction, she took a bullet but bought a Mithril sword laced with poison. She’s likely recuperating while refining its toxins.”

“Mithril boosts poison cultivation! Why didn’t you stop her bid?”

“She vanished before the auction ended. We’ve searched tirelessly since—hence needing you.”

“Only when desperate do you remember me?” Jinhua pouted.

Embracing her, Guan Yu diverted, “Ling’er said you urgently wanted me. I risked much escaping Xue Jing.”

“I know you’re trapped protecting me,” Jinhua sighed. “But these days feel like prison sentences.”

**Chapter 2635: Shadowy Hands**

“Why did you summon me?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Must I need reasons beyond missing you?” Jinhua deflected. “Also…this strange energy—could it harm me?”

Knowing she evaded the truth, Guan Yu pressed, “What do you know about the decade-old treasure legend?”

Jinhua recalled, “The Zhang Clan’s rumored hidden wealth. After their extermination, discrepancies suggested vast undiscovered riches. The Yangs adopted Zhang Han seeking clues, but interest faded…until your map surfaced.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Yang Patriarch nearly died unraveling Zhang Han’s mental seals. My relic saved him. Now the map rekindles treasure fever across the city.”

“Wealth beyond nations…” Jinhua mused. “But why ask me?”

“You’ve mobilized forces against the Yangs. With their patriarch’s new power, is your network ready?”

Jinhua’s eyes hardened. “Not against a Realm Sovereign. We’ll bide time. But Guan Yu…” She hesitated. “There’s another player manipulating events. A shadowy hand reigniting this treasure hunt.”

Guan Yu tensed. “Who?”

“Unclear. But someone’s amplifying tensions between factions. Whatever comes…the storm will dwarf past conflicts.”
