The Left Emissary knew Yanzhao had been lying earlier. Under normal circumstances, Blood Poison wouldn't manifest before its scheduled time, not even during cultivation. It must have been triggered by some special circumstance. Coldly warning, he said, "I remind you not to act rashly against Guanyu. He must remain unharmed for now. Should you scheme against him again..." He let the threat hang like unsheathed steel.

"Yes, understood," Yanzhao replied cautiously, masking his resentment. The Left Emissary's sharp perception unsettled him, though he burned with silent defiance.

"Count yourself fortunate this time. Should you provoke the Blood Poison again..." The emissary vanished mid-sentence, leaving Yanzhao glaring at his retreating silhouette. The young cultivator's fingers twitched, phantom dagger already plunging between those retreating shoulder blades in his mind's eye.

Yet grudging gratitude surfaced. Had the emissary not arrived when he did... Yanzhao shuddered, sinking against a tree. "The heavens smile upon me still," he murmured, tracing the fading poison lines on his forearm. After regaining strength, he'd seek Xiao Zhi and Guanyu - and ensure last night's... indiscretions remained buried with that unfortunate elderly couple.

As midnight's bell faded, Three-Heads paced restlessly. The energy surge came without warning - a dark ripple slicing through bamboo fences. "Who dares?!" he roared, defensive stance forming even as the Left Emissary materialized from shadow.

"Our Demon Lord extends an invitation," the emissary intoned, voice like frozen silk. "Visit Demon Soul Sect as honored guest."

"Your master's hospitality reeks of chains," Three-Heads retorted. "I choose freedom."

This marked their second dance in a moon's cycle. Since losing their physician Sun in the desert wastes, the sect grew desperate. Three-Heads' legendary healing arts made him prime target. Now came the gambit:

"Will you abandon your patriarch then?" The emissary's smile glinted poisonously. "We've... welcomed him as our guest."

Teeth bared, Three-Heads snarled, "Vile worms! You dare take hostages?"

"Merely ensuring negotiations." The emissary's fingers twitched - signal for ambush. Battle erupted, drawing Guanyu and Xiao Zhi from their quarters. Before intervention came, golden light split the night - True Sun Sect's Elder Dehua descending like wrathful bodhisattva.

Chaos birthed opportunity. As energies clashed, the emissary's claw snatched Three-Heads' young protégé Xiao Qi. "Three days," the fading voice taunted. "Or your cub becomes banquet fare!"

In aftermath's tension, Elder Dehua's diagnosis chilled Xiao Zhi: Guanyu's meridian networks blazed with conflicting energies. "Like cauldrons over hellfire," the elder warned after hours of qi stabilization. "One misstep and..."

Dawn found Three-Heads vanished, Guanyu perilously stable, and Demon Soul Sect's shadow stretching long. As Xiao Zhi contemplated their fractured group, distant in Demon Soul's courtyard, Wang Xiaorong absently traced the bars of a wrought-iron cage. Within, a wolf cub's golden eyes burned with human intelligence.
