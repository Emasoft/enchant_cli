Prince Zou lifted his wine cup and took a delicate sip. Though the matter was sensitive, he reasoned that the person beside him would learn of it eventually. "The only confirmed enemies I currently face are the Imperial Guards," he said. "They arrived with a centurion leading over a hundred men against me. Prudence is unavoidable."

Fan Da-ge nodded solemnly as enlightenment dawned. Though a man of the jianghu, he saw no need to probe deeper into affairs beyond his commission. Payment for services rendered was reason enough—whether dealing with court officials or martial artists mattered little. Moreover, the Imperial Guards' blatant overreach suggested their actions lacked proper authorization, making involvement relatively safe.

Worry seemed unnecessary. Even confronting the Imperial Guards held no terror when allies stood united. In moments of peril, no fool would charge ahead recklessly—preserving one's life remained paramount.

Nor did forming grudges with the Guards concern him. Old Fan's obscurity allowed simple identity changes if needed. The evening banquet proceeded merrily. At dawn's first light, Guan Yu's chamber door rattled with the militia captain's knock.

Fortunately, Wang Xiaorong had already risen to fetch hot water. "Captain, so early? Lao Cang hasn't awakened yet."

"I'm not leaving immediately—haven't broken fast either," the captain replied. "Just came to notify you. Have Lao Cang summon me before departure."

"Understood. I'll relay the message," Wang assured.

In truth, Guan Yu had awoken at the first knock. Never sinking into deep slumber here, he remained hyperaware of every sound—both for safety concerns and vigilance over Wang Xiaorong. Letting his guard down might see her snatched away unnoticed.

The captain's dawn visit struck Guan Yu as unnecessary haste. After proper ablutions assisted by Wang, they departed—her true features still concealed beneath disguises. Revealing her beauty might dazzle these rough warriors, but recognition posed greater dangers.

"I wish to accompany you," Wang murmured as they prepared.

Guan Yu chuckled. "You needn't ask. Leaving you here unguarded would haunt me. Your presence reassures me."

Post-breakfast, they met the captain. Guan astride his white steed and Wang her red mare contrasted sharply with the captain's shabby gray mount.

"Riding such fine horses into bandit territory?" The captain eyed their steeds uneasily. "Those cutthroats might seize them."

Wang tossed her head. "Who dares touch Lao Cang's property? Only death-seekers!"

The captain conceded the point. With Guan Yu's formidable skills, risks diminished. His previous solo visit to Red Name Mountain had left him sweating—a den of murderous bandits where silver greased passageways to their leader.

Three riders galloped westward. While Guan and Wang's mounts bounded effortlessly, the captain's nag lagged until Guan called a halt. "We should wait. The captain must lead."

"His plowhorse tires," Wang laughed, dismounting. "Let's rest." They settled beneath a tree, hydrating as the captain finally caught up, drenched in sweat.

"Nearly killed the beast!" he gasped. "Another mile and it'd have dropped dead!"

Guan gestured at the fork ahead. "Which path?"

"Left—the merchant road." The captain pointed where crimson pines crowned a distant slope. "Red Name Mountain. Bandit lair."

"Close then," Guan observed.

"Indeed. Let the horses breathe." The captain drank deeply. "Let's hope Red Hair serves decent fare before negotiations."

Guan smiled, reminded of Xiao Zhi's eternal appetite. Resuming travel, they reached the base where three sentries materialized. "State your business!"

"We seek Red Hair," the captain fawned, producing silver. "Kindly announce us."

Bribes softened attitudes. Soon they ascended past slovenly guards to a ramshackle compound. Red Hair himself emerged—crimson-maned and barrel-chested, his fists like battering rams.

"Welcome!" The bandit chief's gaze sharpened. "Do your companions speak with authority?"

"Absolutely," the captain vouched.

Guan stepped forward. "We require protection for a noble's journey to the capital—paid daily. Enemies may include Imperial Guards."

Red Hair's smile faltered. "Opposing the court? My men won't starve for..."

"This lord is a prince," Guan interjected. "Rewards could transform your fortunes."

The bandit leader stilled. Royal connections versus imperial wrath—a gamble requiring precise stakes. "What terms?"

"Select fifty capable men," Guan pressed. "Paid handsomely to shield His Highness from hundred-strong Guard units."

Red Hair hesitated, weighing silver against survival. At last, ambition glinted. "Fifty loyal blades at your service. Name your price."
