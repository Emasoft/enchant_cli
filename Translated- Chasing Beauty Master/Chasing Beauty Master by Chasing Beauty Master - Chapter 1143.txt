“Wei Hongwei said, ‘Everyone is here, all seventeen of them, not a single one missing.’”

Guan Yu nodded in approval and declared, “The reason I’ve gathered everyone today is to discuss important matters. Our Yu Gang is a formidable organization, but its current scale is not my ultimate goal. My vision is to expand our membership, strengthen our influence, and broaden our reach. Only then can we secure a life of comfort and prosperity.”

The room filled with nods of agreement. Everyone shared Guan Yu’s ambition, for a powerful organization meant protection from bullying and a source of pride when declaring their allegiance.

Guan Yu continued, “To achieve this expansion, unity is paramount. Only through solidarity can our gang grow stronger. Recently, I’ve tasked several hall masters to thoroughly vet our members, ensuring no external spies remain. Betrayal—leaking internal secrets—will not be tolerated.”

**Chapter 2924: Another Reason**

His words sparked murmurs, as if implying traitors lurked among them. In truth, Guan Yu aimed to instill fear, warning them of the consequences of disloyalty.

“Quiet! Let the boss speak!” Jia Bo’s booming voice cut through the chatter.

Guan Yu took a sip of water. “You are the core of the Yu Gang. Henceforth, all major decisions will be discussed with you first. The rest of our brothers fall under your command as hall or incense masters. Relay my words: if any subordinate betrays us, both the traitor and their superior will face punishment. You know my methods. Do not test my patience.”

A chill swept the room. Guan Yu’s stern tone left no room for doubt. His men silently vowed to scrutinize their subordinates, determined to root out any treachery.

Guan Yu observed their tense expressions, satisfied. Fear of consequences would ensure caution.

“As hall and incense masters, you must uphold your responsibilities. Understood?” he barked.

“Yes! We’ll keep our men in line!” Jia Bo pledged first, followed by a chorus of agreement.

Pleased, Guan Yu shifted topics. “The first matter today concerns my sister, Qu Shuangshuang…”

“I know her! The one at Kaihuang High! Bill Lin tried courting her at the gates recently, but you chased him off!” Jia Bo interjected loudly.

Guan Yu glared. “Must you interrupt? Others here may not know her. If you’re so informed, perhaps *you* should address them.”

Though usually approachable, Guan Yu knew when to assert authority. Respect required a balance of familiarity and威严 (awe-inspiring dignity).

Jia Bo scratched his head sheepishly. “Apologies, Boss. My tongue slipped. Please continue.”

Guan Yu sighed. “As Jia Bo mentioned, Qu Shuangshuang studies at Kaihuang High. She is my beloved sister. I urge you to ensure your subordinates stationed there protect her diligently. Spread the word: anyone under our banner must safeguard her.”

In truth, the entire Yu Gang already prioritized her safety. Guan Yu’s reiteration hinted at deeper concerns.

At school, Shuangshuang faced no bullying—thanks to the gang’s shadow. “Inside campus, her safety is your duty. Outside, I’ll handle it,” Guan Yu stated.

Wei Hongwei frowned. “Boss, Bill Lin’s public advances despite knowing she’s your sister—isn’t that a direct挑衅 (provocation)?”

Guan Yu paused. He’d dismissed Bill Lin’s actions as desperation, not defiance. “If he dares挑衅 (provoke) us, he seeks his own ruin.”

“Exactly! Bill Lin’s a fool to challenge us! Let’s rally our hundreds and crush the Feng family!” Jia Bo roared, earning an eye-roll but no rebuke. His audacity aligned with Guan Yu’s mood.

“Another issue: the two venues we took from Ge Yinglai are underperforming. Ma Tong’s casino is diverting our clientele. Thoughts?” Guan Yu asked.

The room hesitated. Only Wei Hongwei, Jia Bo, and Wang Hu held authority to speak.

Wei Hongwei reported, “Our investigations confirm the casino’s booming business. Its 24-hour operations, novel会员制 (membership tiers), and luxury suites—even麻将机 (mahjong tables)—attract the wealthy. Patrons lounge there day and night, neglecting our bars and wellness centers.”

“Sounds enticing! I’d visit myself!” Jia Bo joked.

Guan Yu admitted the allure. Such opulence explained their declining profits. Even their wellness center’s “special services” couldn’t compete with the casino’s discreet offerings.

Jia Bo proposed, “What if we pose as customers, request illicit services, then expose them?”

Guan Yu and Wei Hongwei exchanged exasperated looks. “Ma Tong’s empire thrives because he’s bribed officials. Reporting him would achieve nothing,” Wei Hongwei countered.

Jia Bo grumbled, “Then how do we counter? Our venues cost a fortune to renovate!”

Guan Yu interjected, “Patience. Bill Lin’s impatience will force his hand. He’s allied with Ma Tong, but Ma Tong won’t risk his own forces as pawns. We stay vigilant. At the first sign of trouble, mobilize instantly.”

Nods of resolve followed. Guan Yu’s leadership had never failed them.

**Chapter 2925: The Impatient One**

As the meeting concluded, Wang Hu raised a concern. “Our leather factory secured a large, urgent order from a mysterious client. It feels… suspicious.”

Guan Yu agreed. Sudden windfalls rarely came without strings. “Investigate thoroughly. Have Lan Ting prepare the client’s details for review.”

After Wang Hu left, Jia Bo warned, “Rumors say Ge Yinglai, whose tendons you severed, is returning from overseas treatment.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “A cripple with no势力 (power) is harmless. His former followers have scattered. Focus elsewhere.”

Jia Bo pressed, “But some of his old men still work our venues. Replace them with our own!”

“Easier said. Skilled roles—mixologists, for instance—can’t be replaced overnight. Newcomers can’t craft a ‘Rainbow Eclipse’ cocktail,” Wei Hongwei argued.

Guan Yu nodded. “Competence trumps haste. We’ll manage.”

**Chapter 2926: Holding the Fort**

The men dispersed, tensions simmering. United under Guan Yu’s cunning, the Yu Gang braced for storms ahead—their loyalty as unyielding as their leader’s resolve.
