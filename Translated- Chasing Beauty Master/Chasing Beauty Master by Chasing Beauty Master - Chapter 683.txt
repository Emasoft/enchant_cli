The Divine Emperor, though aware Guan Yu was feigning ignorance, replied, “Even before your arrival on Eastern Island, we had initiated contact with your nation, Huaxia. Both sides reached a preliminary consensus to set aside past grievances and unite against impending calamities. Recently, nations plan to convene on a Pacific island near America to formalize cooperation. Returning these weapons signifies our sincerity.”

Accepting this, Guan Yu waved his hand. The twelve weapons vanished from their stands. The Divine Emperor gaped in awe. “Remarkable, Brother Guan Yu! As night deepens, I shan’t detain you. Should you wish to meet Martial God Ito, he meditates atop Mount Fushi. You’ll find him easily.”

Guan Yu understood tonight’s summons solely aimed to return weapons as an olive branch to Huaxia. True cooperation between nations bound by decades of divergent ideologies? That road remained long.

Yet these divine phenomena revealed Earth wasn’t alone in the cosmos—a silver lining amidst looming threats. Though extraterrestrial beings brought catastrophe, humanity’s unity against invasion kindled hope.

The eventful night—Guan Yu’s duel with Zaochuan Mao, the Divine Emperor’s audience—culminated in a café where Guan Yu and Yingzi sipped coffee.

“Where next?” Yingzi asked, knowing his power destined him to confront impending disasters. Her heart ached with unspoken attachment.

Though their acquaintance spanned mere days, Yingzi’s innate grace and their effortless rapport endeared her deeply. Guan Yu pondered. “My objectives—retrieving weapons and gauging Ito’s strength—are achieved. I must return to handle matters in Huaxia.”

Yingzi’s eyes dimmed. As the Higashi policewoman and scion of the Takahashi clan, she couldn’t follow. “When I get leave, I’ll visit. You’ll show me Huaxia’s wonders, yes?”

“Certainly,” Guan Yu smiled. “But tonight’s moon bathes Mount Fushi in splendor. Shall we ascend?”

“Drawn by the nightscape,” Yingzi teased, “or the Divine Emperor’s hint about Ito?”

“Both!”

Most revered Mount Fushi’s sanctity from afar after dark. Yet exhilarated, Yingzi gulped her coffee and dragged Guan Yu outside.

Stopping her from driving, Guan Yu bade her close her eyes. “A gift? Or a stolen kiss?” she grinned, recalling cinematic tropes.

“Discover for yourself.”

Yingzi obliged, pulse racing as Guan Yu’s arms encircled her waist. Suddenly weightless, they soared skyward. Wind roared until a spiritual barrier silenced it. “Open your eyes.”

Hovering hundreds of meters above Koto City—a jeweled tapestry below—Yingzi shrieked in delight. Cradled securely, she marveled at the luminous grid.

“Want to fly yourself?” Guan Yu asked.

“Me? I can’t even defeat third-tier mutants!”

Channeling wood-attributed spiritual energy into her, Guan Yu gaped as Yingzi transformed—a glowing sylph soaring effortlessly. Her laughter echoed through the night until danger prickled his senses.

Koto City glittered below like constellations captured on velvet. Yingzi’s euphoria faded as Guan Yu tensed, teleporting them away just as a lethal aura struck their previous position.

Earlier revelations resurfaced—Yingzi’s peerless wood alignment mirrored Xue Jing’s water affinity. The Huantian Pearl’s prophecy of five elemental extremes and Earth’s hidden history intertwined mysteriously. As Yingzi’s laughter rang above, Guan Yu’s mind raced—were these women keystones to unlocking cosmic secrets?

When terrestrial conflicts paled against celestial riddles, one truth remained: humanity’s fragile paradigms would shatter beneath revelations from the divine realms. Yet Guan Yu vowed to shield this fragile world—through alliances, newfound powers, and bonds transcending nations.
