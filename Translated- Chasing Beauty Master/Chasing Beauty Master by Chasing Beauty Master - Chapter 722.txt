“So that’s how it was,” Guan Yu mused, his thoughts shifting to another matter. “The reason you followed me that night was to rescue that young girl, wasn’t it?”

“Exactly,” Yang Conghan admitted. “I was trailing you at first. We both witnessed her abduction. When those brutes tried to assault her and you hesitated to act, I intervened.”

Guan Yu couldn’t help but admire the Yang family’s martial arts. The fact that Yang Conghan had shadowed him undetected sent a chill down his spine. Had she been an enemy, he’d have perished a hundred times over.

Noticing his curiosity, Yang Conghan explained, “Our Yang family’s internal techniques prioritize breath concealment. Our prowess lies in stealth and agility. The only external skill we cultivate is the art of flying daggers.”

“Ah, so I’ve encountered true professionals,” Guan Yu remarked, finally understanding why he hadn’t sensed her cultivation level earlier. Their entire discipline revolved around concealment.

“I hope Miss Jinhua doesn’t misunderstand,” Guan Yu continued carefully. “I merely inquired out of curiosity. Miss Yang’s beauty is truly captivating, and I’m willing to save her family. However…”

His dilemma lay not in whether Yang Conghan would become his woman, but in retrieving the World Lord’s Sacred Relic. Obtaining it would inevitably alert Xue Jing. Would she consent? The relic was irreplaceable—he believed it to be the only one of its kind in existence.

After all, slaying a World Lord at the peak of cultivation was near impossible.

As Guan Yu frowned in contemplation, Yang Conghan spoke softly, “Young Master Guan, please don’t trouble yourself. I know the relic’s immense value outweighs my humble self. Let’s not burden you further.” Her disappointment was palpable.

Witnessing her vulnerable state stirred Guan Yu’s compassion. If he refused, this exquisite beauty would be forced to marry the despicable Young Master Feng. “There is a way,” he declared. “It’s not that I begrudge the relic—it’s simply not in my possession. Retrieving it poses challenges, but I swear I’ll bring it to save your father.”

Resolve hardened within him. He couldn’t let this rare flower be trampled by Feng. Though the relic was priceless, a peerless beauty like Yang Conghan appeared only once a century.

Upon his agreement, Yang Conghan’s spirits lifted visibly. Jinhua shared her joy but secretly lamented—Guan Yu was her Prince Charming, and she couldn’t let him slip away.

“From this moment, our Xiaohan belongs to you,” Jinhua announced. “Do as you wish.” Guan Yu’s gaze swept over Yang Conghan’s alluring form, desire warring with propriety. The relic hadn’t been delivered yet—was it proper to claim her now?

Lowering his eyes, Guan Yu found himself staring at her jade-like feet encased in translucent ballet flats. The delicate arches and perfectly aligned toes resembled sculpted art, enough to drive any foot fetishist mad.

Blood rushed to his face. Noticing his gaze, Yang Conghan blushed crimson, shyly tucking her feet beneath the desk.

“Why be modest now that you’re his woman?” Jinhua teased. “Young Master, why not take me too? You’ve always been my Prince Charming.”

Guan Yu’s head spun. Even retrieving one relic would earn Xue Jing’s scolding. Bringing back two women? Lan Yu would have his head! Yet refusing Jinhua proved difficult—though less stunning than Yang Conghan, she remained a beauty in her own right.

Before he could respond, Yang Conghan interjected sternly, “Impossible. Guan Yu’s harem is crowded enough. Fewer rivals mean better chances for me.”

Guan Yu: “……”
Jinhua: “……”

Both stared speechless. They hadn’t anticipated Yang Conghan’s swift shift to harem politics. Guan Yu wondered why every beauty transformed into a scheming court lady after joining him—Xue Jing, Lü Mei, Lan Yu, Amei, even the icy Yang Conghan. Had his pre-amnesia lovers been equally jealous?

Though aggrieved, Jinhua conceded, “Then let me remain as your attendant, Xiaohan. You’ll need help managing such an absent man.” Secretly, she plotted—staying close meant future opportunities to seduce Guan Yu.

**Chapter 1834: The Absurd**

Unaware of Jinhua’s scheming, Guan Yu focused on retrieving the relic. Time was life for the dying Yang patriarch.

After summoning Hou Jinshun, Yang Conghan ordered, “Close Flower Night Club for renovations. Guan Yu will handle the layout—you manage the rest.” She handed Hou a black card loaded with funds, inwardly smirking at his visible greed.

As Guan Yu prepared to depart, Yang Conghan insisted on accompanying him in her custom white Aston Martin—a spotless marvel with snow-white interior accented by azure. The virgin seats had never borne another passenger until now.

Jinhua watched anxiously from a trailing security car. Yang Conghan’s unprecedented permission for Guan Yu to ride spoke volumes—her heart was already given.

Bathed in Yang Conghan’s signature fragrance, Guan Yu asked dreamily, “Do you favor white and azure?”

“Since childhood,” she replied, navigating the roads. “Most possessions reflect these hues.”

“A cleanliness obsession?”

“Jinhua claims so.”

“Another complicated beauty,” Guan Yu mused.

Calling Xue Jing, he braced for wrath. “Where’s the World Lord’s Sacred Relic? I need it to save someone.”

“Who warrants that treasure?” Xue Jing demanded.

“The Yang family patriarch. His daughter—A City’s top beauty—is now my woman.”

The explosion came as expected. “You reckless philanderer! Squandering relics on new conquests? You’ve become utterly absurd!”

After weathering the storm, Guan Yu obtained the relic’s location. Xue Jing, though furious, ultimately relented—men’s decisions deserved support.

Returning home, they encountered Xue Jing at the gate. Her eyes widened at Yang Conghan’s unearthly beauty. “No wonder you’d spend the relic,” she sighed, ushering them inside.

As Yang Conghan explained her father’s critical condition—meridians ruptured from cultivation deviation, sustained only by her grandfather’s dying efforts—Xue Jing questioned, “Why not seek the Feng family’s Eternal Abyss?”

“They demanded my hand in exchange,” Yang Conghan whispered. “Their heir is a monster who tortures women to death.”

**Chapter 1835: Yang Kunlun**

Xue Jing’s expression softened. “The relic may be crucial for Guan Yu’s memory recovery. Are you prepared to risk his future?”

“We’ll face tomorrow when it comes,” Guan Yu insisted. “Saving lives takes precedence.”

Moved by his determination, Xue Jing produced an ornate box containing the glowing relic. “I’ll accompany you—I need to verify this ‘incurable’ condition.”

The Yang compound’s sprawling traditional architecture astonished them—a palace frozen in antiquity. Yet Yang Conghan’s modern aesthetic seemed incongruent. “I reside elsewhere,” she clarified. “Only elders dwell here.”

As they approached the patriarch’s chambers, tensions simmered—between life and legacy, love and duty, in a world where power and beauty danced their eternal waltz.
