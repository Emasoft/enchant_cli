“What did you say?” Guan Yu’s body twitched at Bika Cat’s words. Having witnessed the ferocity of werewolves firsthand—where even a single one had pushed them to their limits—the prospect of being ambushed from both front and rear was unnerving.

“Though this scent isn’t as intense as before. I wonder what’s going on!”

Following Bika Cat’s observation, Guan Yu tentatively sniffed the air. An unusual odor lingered, growing stronger and closer—originating precisely from the corner ahead!

To avoid alerting their quarry, Guan Yu refrained from warning nearby pedestrians. Instead, he leaped onto a rooftop while Bika Cat mirrored the move across the street. Their plan: to flank any emerging werewolf.

As they steadied themselves, rapid movement echoed through the alley. The moment the figure burst into view, Guan Yu gaped—their awaited “werewolf” was none other than Liu Yishou!

Guan Yu hadn’t expected their quarry to be a young woman. Though wary, he couldn’t reconcile her appearance with the werewolf’s stench.

Bika Cat reappeared at his side, whispering, “Boss, something’s off about her…”

“Nonsense! She’s no werewolf. Did we misread the signs?”

**Chapter 1392: Allure**

“Boss, your instincts might waver, but my feline nose never lies. That odor *definitely* came from her!”

“But how? She’s clearly human. Did her femininity cloud your judgment?”

“Ahem. Projecting much, boss?”

Though newly acquainted, Guan Yu and Bika Cat shared a bond forged through mutual understanding of each other’s secrets.

“Enough jokes. I’m not in the mood. Truth is, I sense something too. Our senses rarely align by accident. Remember Wolf Tianhua? He first appeared human too.”

“Right—except this time it’s a female werewolf. This’ll get…*interesting*.”

“You mangy cat! What filth fills your mind?”

“Heh. Don’t play innocent, boss.”

With shared smirks, they dropped from the rooftops, blocking the woman’s path.

Startled from her leisurely stroll, the woman recoiled. Guan Yu and Bika Cat exchanged uneasy glances—if she *were* human, their theatrics made them the lunatics.

“Are you insane?” she snapped.

Guan Yu forced a smile. “Apologies, miss. We thought you…suspicious.”

Her stunned expression sent them into fits of laughter. She promptly dismissed them as madmen and strode onward.

“Wait, sister!” Guan Yu pursued.

“*Who* are you calling ‘sister’?”

The woman shot him a withering glare. “*Two* stalkers? Think I’m blind?”

Bika Cat yawned from Guan Yu’s shoulder. “He’s right. There *are* two.”

“What joke is—?” Her words died as she noticed the talking cat. Three seconds later, a shriek pierced the air: “Ghost! A talking cat!”

As she bolted, they gave chase. Bika Cat muttered, “Boss, are we wrong? She shows no werewolf traits.”

“Maybe she’s masking them?”

“If so, she’s mastered the art.”

“Keep chasing?”

Their hesitation shattered at the sound of commotion ahead.

“What’s that crowd?”

Bika Cat’s ears twitched. “Did she transform?”

Before they could investigate, a mob wielding pickaxes and clubs surrounded them—with the fleeing woman at its center.

Pointing dramatically, she cried, “They’re monsters! They tried to assault me!”

Guan Yu’s jaw dropped. Their noble hunt had backfired spectacularly—branded as perverts and fiends.

An elderly man chastised, “You look refined, yet prey on maidens? Shameful!”

Guan Yu retorted, “Old man, slander is a crime. Where’s your proof?”

“Still lying? We’ll beat the truth out!”

As weapons rose, Guan Yu pleaded, “Wait! Why trust her blindly?”

“We trust her because you’re clearly guilty, you lecher!”

**Chapter 1393: Mayor Barde**

Guan Yu grimaced. Once revered, he now faced a mob’s wrath. Worse, the men hung on the woman’s every word, utterly enchanted.

“Calm yourselves! I can provide witnesses—”

“No more tricks!” a bearded man interrupted.

A booming voice cut through: “Let him speak. Our town’s reputation matters.”

The crowd parted for a hulking, fierce-faced man—Mayor Barde.

Guan Yu stepped forward. “Mayor Barde, I’m Guan Yu.”

The mayor sneered. “Save introductions. Prove your innocence or leave.”

Guan Yu understood their distrust. Barren Town, a war-scarred buffer zone between elves and humans, bred inherent suspicion.

“My companion is Liu Yishou. Know him?”

Murmurs rippled. “Liu? Attacked by a monster! Missing since yesterday!”

“Nonsense! I saw him this morning heading to the mass graves—with *him*!” A finger jabbed at Guan Yu.

At “mass graves,” the crowd paled. Guan Yu felt their visceral fear.

Another voice shouted, “Liu never returned after going with him!”

“He’s the monster! He devoured Liu!”

Guan Yu nearly choked. First a pervert, now a cannibal? Were it not for needing antidotes for Amy, he’d abandon this madness.

Mayor Barde roared, “Silence! Creature, any last words?”

Guan Yu scoffed. “Oh ‘enlightened’ mayor, ever heard ‘muscles over brains’? If I were a monster, you’d already be dead. I’m here to hunt werewolves—unlike you fools coddling the real threat!”

The woman whimpered, “Protect me! I’m no werewolf!”

Barde glowered. “Preposterous! This delicate flower?”

“Beauty masks beasts. Tell me, mayor—did your father and grandfather die…violently?”

Barde stiffened. “None of your business!”

“Ah. Explains the family incompetence.”

Enraged, Barde bellowed, “Seize him! 100 gold coins to the captor!”

As villagers lunged, Guan Yu whispered to Bika Cat, “Handle the werewolf. I’ll distract them.”

The cat nodded, slipping through legs toward the smirking woman.

Spotting the approach, she screamed, “The pervert’s cat attacks!”

The mob turned, unimpressed by the scrawny feline—until Bika Cat spoke: “Clever move, using pawns.”

Panicked cries erupted: “Demon cat! Run!”

Bika Cat taunted the fleeing crowd, “Where’s your heroism now?”

**Chapter 1394: Strategy**

The woman’s ploy split the mob—half fled, while a few brave souls stood their ground.

Bika Cat sighed. “You’re good. But this ends now.”

The woman’s eyes darted nervously before she unleashed her trump card: “Help! The cat’s possessed!”

This time, her claim gained traction when Bika Cat yawned, “Took you long enough to notice.”

Screams of “Monster!” and “Witchcraft!” filled the air as the remaining onlookers scattered.

Undeterred, Bika Cat advanced. “Your theatrics won’t save you. Time to shed the act, *werewolf*.”

The woman’s facade cracked, a feral glint replacing her earlier helplessness. Unseen by the fleeing villagers, her nails elongated into claws.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu effortlessly dodged clumsy attacks, shouting over the chaos: “Barde! Your family died because they ignored real threats! Will you repeat their mistake?”

The mayor froze mid-swing, vulnerability flashing across his brutish features—a crack in generations of willful ignorance.

The standoff teetered on a knife’s edge, where truth and deception battled through words, claws, and the weight of a town’s haunted history.
