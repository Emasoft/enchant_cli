“After experiencing the thrill once, Mo Ling resolutely refused to participate a second time. If she were chosen, wouldn’t Guan Yu have a legitimate reason to enter her room and indulge in mischief? She wasn’t ready yet.

‘Ling Ling, just give it a try. See if I’m cheating. Being wronged by you all the time is so frustrating,’ Guan Yu pouted, feigning innocence.

‘You big pervert, go back to sleep!’ Mo Ling couldn’t endure Guan Yu’s shameless gaze any longer and turned to leave.

Guan Yu secretly rejoiced, then subtly winked at Du Xiaojuan. Her face flushed crimson, like a guilty child caught misbehaving. Whenever Guan Yu gave her that look, it meant he would visit her room that night.

Guan Yu shuffled the cards nonchalantly, letting Feng Xin and Wen Qing shuffle them too. Unsurprisingly, Du Xiaojuan drew the Joker.

He gave Wen Qing a regretful look. ‘Don’t lose the clothes!’

‘Hmph, we’ll see how you perform next time!’ Wen Qing retorted with a coquettish snort.

Guan Yu feigned ignorance of her implication.

He chuckled awkwardly. ‘How about adding two Jokers next time?’

‘Dream on!’ Feng Xin and Wen Qing snapped in unison, exchanging glances before storming off.

Guan Yu sighed. The awaited day seemed distant, filling him with disappointment.

‘Xiaojuan, the night is short,’ Guan Yu turned to Du Xiaojuan with a roguish grin.

Blushing, Du Xiaojuan acquiesced. Under Guan Yu’s tutelage, she shed her shyness. After their passionate encounter, she lay on his chest, eyes closed.

‘Gao Wei is coming to N City. Will you meet her tomorrow?’ Du Xiaojuan whispered.

‘Gao Wei? Why?’ Guan Yu frowned.

‘She’s a star from our university. How could she miss the anniversary?’ Du Xiaojuan replied.

‘But it’s weeks away. Why come early?’

‘Maybe she wants to see you!’ Du Xiaojuan teased.

Guan Yu smacked her butt. ‘Nonsense!’

Du Xiaojuan pouted. ‘I’m visiting my parents tomorrow. Keep Gao Wei company.’

‘She’s a grown woman. She can manage,’ Guan Yu retorted.

‘She’s a star with few friends. You must accompany her!’

‘Fine, I’ll go!’

Guan Yu embraced her. ‘Let’s try some new moves.’

His hand wandered downward.

‘Ah! You rogue!’

Moans echoed through the soundproof room.

The next morning, Guan Yu drove to Gao Wei’s hotel. Two men lurked in the hallway.

‘Everything’s set. Just wait for her to undress.’

‘Pity there’s no man for a full reenactment.’

‘This’ll ruin her. She crossed our boss.’

‘Hush! Someone’s coming!’

Guan宇 frowned at their retreating backs.

**Chapter 784: A Compromising Meeting**

Guan Yu knocked on Gao Wei’s door.

‘Why are you here?’ Gao Wei asked, surprised.

‘Xiaojuan asked me to accompany you.’ He shrugged.

‘Oh.’ She avoided his gaze.

‘Why won’t you look at me? Am I too handsome?’

Gao Wei rolled her eyes. ‘You wish!’

‘Should we chat in the hallway? You’re a star – who’d be scandalized?’

She laughed, letting him in.

Later, Guan宇 noticed a glint on the teapot – a hidden camera. He recalled the hallway conversation about exposing Gao Wei.

Bursting into her bedroom, he tackled her onto the bed, covering them with a blanket.

‘There’s a hidden camera! They want to create a scandal!’

After explaining, Guan宇 kissed her passionately for the cameras’ benefit.

‘We need to act natural. I’ll catch them,’ he said, exiting to call Feng Xin.

**Chapter 785: The Capture**

Two men monitored footage in a nearby room.

Guan宇 burst in, apprehending them. ‘Enjoying the show?’

The men panicked as Guan宇 confiscated their equipment.

‘Your boss’s plan failed. Enjoy prison.’
