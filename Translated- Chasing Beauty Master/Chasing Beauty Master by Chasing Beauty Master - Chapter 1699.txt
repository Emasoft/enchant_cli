Lin Chen’s palms began to itch. Such a tall, striking figure—goodness, even the sight made one’s mouth water. He realized his charm had seemingly grown lately.

In the past, Lin Chen had harbored a sliver of insecurity about his appearance. But recent attitudes from Siqi and now this Amei before him had reignited his confidence.

Tall, imposing, handsome—these were the words Lin Chen used to describe himself. If he could truly cross paths with someone like her today, he felt this trip wouldn’t be in vain.

Amei said, “If the young master is willing, tonight you may come to the inn at the southern end of town. I’ll await you there.”

“Splendid!” Lin Chen replied with a hearty laugh. “Amei is truly forthright. I’ve always preferred dealing with those of your temperament.”

“What’s going on here? Do you two know each other?” Guan Yu’s voice suddenly rang out nearby. From afar, Guan Yu had spotted Lin Chen’s smug grin—a clear sign of mischief.

Having eaten his fill and bored, Guan Yu had fetched Siqi to surprise Lin Chen. Now they stood behind him.

**Chapter 4444: Confidence**

Lin Chen turned, ready to scold Guan Yu for meddling, but froze upon seeing Siqi beside him. His heart skipped a beat as he stammered, “Siqi? Why are you here? When did you and Guan Yu arrive?”

“We’ve been here awhile, standing right behind you,” Guan Yu declared with feigned seriousness. “Didn’t you say you were going to find an inn? Why linger here?”

“N-nothing! I was just settling the bill,” Lin Chen fibbed, guiltily glancing between Siqi and Amei.

Siqi pressed pointedly, “Then why haven’t you left after paying? Everyone’s waiting for you to secure lodging. Do you have leisure to chat idly?”

“Of course not!” Lin Chen’s heart nearly leapt from his throat. “Don’t misunderstand, Siqi! I was just about to leave—right now!”

With that, he bolted as if fleeing reincarnation itself. Siqi and Guan Yu exchanged amused glances, stifling laughter.

Outside, Lin Chen patted his chest, shaken. Though tempted to pursue the tall Amei, he couldn’t risk Siqi discovering his flirtations. To him, Siqi remained his paramount goddess—no other woman could rival her status.

He shuddered at the close call, praying Siqi hadn’t overheard his conversation with Amei. During this critical phase of deepening their relationship, exposure would spell doom.

Yet regret gnawed at him. What should’ve cost thirty-three taels became forty—extravagant waste! Ordinarily, he’d never overspend, but chatting with Amei and securing tonight’s rendezvous made it worthwhile.

From a distance, Ling Su had observed Lin Chen’s lengthy exchange with the woman at the counter. Now, with Lin Chen gone and Guan Yu and Siqi departed, Ling Su approached.

**Chapter 4445: My Different Perspective**

Casually strolling to the counter, Ling Su was struck by the clerk’s beauty up close. Her stature loomed even across the counter.

“Miss,” Ling Su began, striking a pose he deemed dashing, “did my friend settle the bill earlier? If not, charge it to me.”

“Oh?” Amei studied him curiously.

Ling Su brimmed with confidence, especially when contrasted against Lin Chen’s subordinate-like presence. At Yunqing Sect, Senior Brother Yan Zhao had once been unrivaled in appearance, cultivation, and status—his prestige amplified by unmatched prowess. Though plain-faced, his halo of authority made him irresistible to female disciples.

Now that the traitor Yan Zhao faced sect-wide pursuit, Ling Su crowned himself Yunqing’s new leader. With no rivals remaining—Lin Chen couldn’t compare in cultivation or looks—Ling Su aggressively courted Siqi, believing their pairing divinely ordained.

Though others never voiced this, Ling Su felt destined to claim Siqi. Her recent coldness toward him and warmth toward Lin Chen infuriated him. To Ling Su, Lin Chen had become expendable—best eliminated discreetly to avoid scandal.

Their former friendship now lay in tatters. While Lin Chen remained wary, he underestimated Ling Su’s murderous intent. Guan Yu relished their rift, though Siqi’s act weighed on her.

Seizing any advantage, Ling Su approached Amei. “Your friend already paid,” she informed.

“Did he say anything else?” Ling Su feigned concern. “If so, please disregard it. My friend suffers mental instability and a highly contagious disease. Exercise caution around him.”

With this slander delivered, Ling Su departed, resolved to sabotage any liaison between Lin Chen and Amei. Exposing such trysts to Siqi would surely rupture their bond.

Amei frowned at the retreating figure. True friends didn’t disparage each other thus—clearly, enmity lurked beneath.

**Chapter 4446: Unsuitable**

The group awaited Lin Chen’s return. “Wang Jun,” Guan Yu suggested, “let’s stroll outside. It’s stifling here.”

Though reluctant, Wang Jun acquiesced, recognizing Guan Yu’s wish to accompany Siqi without raising eyebrows. Including Aze and himself would prevent gossip.

Exiting the bun shop, they found Camel Town bustling despite its modest size.

“Senior Sister Siqi,” Aze inquired, “what’s most crucial in desert travel?”

“With camels and ample water,” Siqi explained, “we’ll endure far longer. Though cultivators can sustain themselves through meditation, hydration remains essential.”

Aze nodded. “Camels can last ten days after feeding. With extra fodder, a month’s journey becomes feasible.”

“Easier said than done,” Wang Jun countered. “If camels perish, trudging through sand exhausts swiftly.”

Siqi proposed, “What if we craft wooden sandals? Larger surface area would prevent sinking.”

“Wooden sandals?” Aze puzzled.

“Brilliant!” Guan Yu endorsed. “Wider boards distribute weight—like snowshoes for sand. We’ll need lightweight timber.”

At a lumberyard, they debated material. “Hardwood ensures durability,” Siqi insisted.

“But lightweight wood reduces fatigue,” Guan Yu argued.

“Why not both?” Aze interjected naively.

“Contradictory requirements,” Guan Yu clarified. “Dense woods are heavy; light woods lack hardness. No perfect balance exists.”

Chastened, Aze fell silent as they selected materials, the group embarking on their improvised desert preparation—a testament to adaptability in uncertain terrain.
