“Xiao Zhu, brother-in-law really has already laid down to sleep and is almost asleep. You should hurry back—we need to rise early tomorrow,” Guanyu advised.

Yet Xiao Zhu remained utterly unpersuaded. Pouting angrily, she retorted, “Brother-in-law, you’re being mean! Leaving me freezing outside like this! If I fall ill tomorrow, it’ll be all your fault for not letting me in. Wuwu…”

What a little tyrant! Guanyu had no choice. He couldn’t let her freeze outside. Sighing, he rose, slipped on his shoes, and dialed Lin Qiaoqiao’s number as he walked.

When the call connected, he said wearily, “Your cousin is camped outside my door refusing to leave. I’m worried she’ll catch cold, so I’ll let her inside. Come take her away quickly.”

Lin Qiaoqiao sounded puzzled. “Why would she go to your room? Didn’t she already go to bed with Auntie?”

“You ask me, but who should I ask?” Guanyu grumbled.

Upon opening the door, Xiao Zhu flung herself into Guanyu’s arms. An icy gust accompanied her—her entire body felt chilled to the bone.

Guanyu swiftly shut the door and chided softly, “Xiao Zhu, why are you so disobedient? What if you really catch a cold? Why dart out dressed so lightly?”

Snuggling into Guanyu’s warmth, Xiao Zhu replied blissfully, “Aiya, I finally made it inside! Even catching a cold would be worth it.”

The girl’s motives baffled him—it felt like deliberate teasing. “Why seek me out so late? Couldn’t this wait until tomorrow?”

Xiao Zhu wore only oversized bunny slippers, microscopic shorts, and a flimsy belly wrap. The curves beneath her top already resembled two plump steamed buns.

Dressed so scantily, no wonder she shivered. Guanyu averted his eyes, scooped her up, deposited her on the bed, and tucked the quilt around her.

Xiao Zhu giggled gleefully. “Brother-in-law is so good to me! I came to sleep here with you. Tomorrow you’ll help us fight the big monster, so I want to keep you company tonight.”

“Why would I need company? I’m grown—sleeping alone doesn’t scare me,” Guanyu sighed.

Xiao Zhu’s cheeks glowed red from cold, stirring Guanyu’s concern. She insisted, “Of course you do! If I don’t stay, you might change your mind! If you refuse to help tomorrow, the monster will keep terrorizing our village.”

“Would I really break my promise? Do you think me so untrustworthy?” Guanyu asked, wounded.

“Yes!” Xiao Zhu declared bluntly. “This afternoon you said you’d return quickly, but made me wait forever. That’s breaking trust!”

Guanyu choked on his words. Who could have imagined this afternoon’s minor delay would leave such an impression?

He explained patiently, “Xiao Zhu, you can’t sleep here. A man and woman alone in one room—you know the gossip it would cause.”

“I know!” she chirped. “But no one will gossip—I’m willing! Even if you’re my brother-in-law, you’re only my cousin’s fiancé. You could still marry me! I’ll gladly be your bride!” Her declaration hung audaciously in the air.

Guanyu’s head throbbed. Technically, she wasn’t wrong. If questioned tomorrow, Xiao Zhu’s willingness would shield him from ridicule.

Local customs permitted multiple wives without conflict. However, it would tarnish both Lin Qiaoqiao’s and his reputation—they weren’t formally married yet. Taking a “second wife” so soon would seem unfair.

Moreover, Guanyu had never considered Xiao Zhu in this light. Though fourteen marked maturity here, she still seemed too young to him.

While he appreciated her youthful charm, his engagement to Lin Qiaoqiao was already pretend. Indulging Xiao Zhu—even willingly—would damage their standing. Especially before their monster-hunting mission, lest people claim he helped merely to impress a girl.

“Xiao Zhu, you’re still young. Give yourself a few more years. You might meet someone you like better,” Guanyu advised gently.

**Chapter 3075: The Fickleness of Men**

At fifteen, Xiao Zhu understood everything. Modern children matured early—even ten-year-olds knew about romance.

“I don’t care!” Xiao Zhu stamped her foot. “I like you, brother-in-law! If you reject me, I’ll follow you forever—unless you heartlessly abandon me. If you’re that cruel, throw me back outside to freeze!”

Guanyu blinked, startled by her manipulative ultimatum. Truly young but shrewd!

“Very well. Since you insist…” Guanyu feigned sternness, retrieving her bunny slippers. “Put these on and leave now.”

Xiao Zhu retracted her snow-white feet under the quilt, grinning impishly. “No! I’m staying! You’ll have to carry me out naked!”

She shook her head defiantly, confident he wouldn’t dare.

Just as Guanyu despaired, Lin Qiaoqiao entered. Seeing Xiao Zhu in Guanyu’s bed, her expression darkened.

“Xiao Zhu! Why disturb Guanyu so late? He needs proper rest to fight tomorrow!” Lin Qiaoqiao coaxed.

“I’m sleeping here! Why are you in brother-in-law’s room at midnight?” Xiao Zhu shot back.

“I…” Lin Qiaoqiao faltered. As the “fiancée,” her presence should be natural—yet here she stood, challenged by her cousin.

“Enough! Sleep in my room tonight,” Lin Qiaoqiao compromised.

She wondered how Xiao Zhu had located Guanyu’s room. “Doesn’t Auntie worry about you? Let’s return.”

“No! I sneaked out after Mama fell asleep. Going back wastes my effort! I’m staying!” Xiao Zhu burrowed deeper, accidentally revealing her scant clothing—a Donald Duck panty and pink belly wrap barely containing her budding curves.

Lin Qiaoqiao gaped. “You came dressed like that?”

“This is proper clothing!” Xiao Zhu tugged her belly wrap defensively.

Realizing her cousin aimed to poach her man, Lin Qiaoqiao stripped to similar attire—a loose yellow camisole—flooding the room with pale radiance.

Guanyu’s eyes widened. Though surrounded by beauties in Qiao District, the allure of “another’s wife” proved potent. Men’s fickleness truly knew no bounds!

Before he could react, Lin Qiaoqiao announced, “Then I’m staying too!”

Guanyu suddenly remembered Secondonly Wolf might be watching. He scooped Lin Qiaoqiao into the bed, covering her with the quilt.

Her face burned crimson—never before held so intimately by a man.

Xiao Zhu pouted. “Why must you intrude, cousin?”

“If you can stay, why can’t I?” Lin Qiaoqiao countered, matching her cousin’s stubbornness.

“Enough!” Guanyu barked. “Stay if you must, but keep still under the covers! Remember—someone might be watching!”

**Chapter 3076: The Missing Girls**

Lin Qiaoqiao gasped. “You mean Secondonly Wolf? Oh no! He saw me…” She pummeled Guanyu with a pillow. “Why didn’t you warn me sooner?”

Xiao Zhu shivered. “Brother-in-law, don’t scare me! Who’s watching?”

“Just behave, and no harm will come,” Guanyu said ominously, switching off the light. The girls clung together fearfully.

Later, Xiao Zhu wriggled to Guanyu’s left, sandwiching him between warm, fragrant softness.

“My left leg!”

“Your hand’s crossing the boundary!”

The women divided him like territory, limbs entwined. Any movement risked scandalous contact.

When dawn’s clamor woke Guanyu, both girls still nestled against him. He’d restrained himself—Xiao Zhu’s youth demanded protection.

Chaos reigned outside. Auntie had discovered Xiao Zhu missing, then Lin Qiaoqiao’s absence. The mansion searched every corner.

“Could they be in the son-in-law’s rooms?” voices murmured outside.

Guanyu bolted up. If found like this, explanations would prove impossible. He dressed hastily, rousing the girls.

Xiao Zhu yawned. “So early…”

“We leave for your village today. Rise, sleepyhead!”

Lin Qiaoqiao blinked. “Why the commotion?”

“You’re the cause!” Guanyu groaned. “The whole household hunts for you two. Your parents must be frantic!”

“Oh no! What do we do?” Lin Qiaoqiao paled.

Regret washed over her—this midnight escapade had spiraled beyond control.
