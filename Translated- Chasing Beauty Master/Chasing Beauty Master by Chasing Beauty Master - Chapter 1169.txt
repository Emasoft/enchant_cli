“To be frank, I already have several fragments of such treasure maps in my possession,” Bill Lin said with a chuckle. “I’ve been slowly collecting these so-called treasure map fragments with a simple goal—if I ever gather them all, I might truly obtain the treasure marked on them. That’s the best outcome. Otherwise, keeping these fragments as collectibles still holds great value. I believe these items are immensely worthy of preservation.”

**Chapter 2994: Utterly Useless**

Xie Lao nodded. “So that’s the case. And you already have multiple fragments? How astonishing. It seems you truly are a wealthy man.” His words carried a sycophantic tone, and Bill Lin basked in the praise about his riches—indeed, this had been his greatest advantage since birth.

“How much did you spend acquiring these fragments?” Xie Lao suddenly asked.

Bill Lin had initially thought the old man was a fool who could be easily coaxed into selling the fragment cheaply. This question caught him off guard. If he revealed the true prices, he’d have to pay exorbitantly for today’s fragment. But quoting too low might dissuade the seller.

Poison Widow interjected smoothly, “Since the origins and positions of treasure map fragments vary, their prices differ too. Our young master has acquired fragments at all ranges—some for mere dozens of coins, others... well, the higher sums aren’t so easily disclosed.”

Xie Lao, fully aware of their scheming, knew they aimed to swindle him. Guan Yu had warned him: the treasure map’s sale proceeds would be split evenly, and while typical fragments sold for tens of millions, this one reeked of... unconventional storage.

“Truthfully, many have approached me these days wanting to buy my fragment,” Xie Lao said. “Most I’ve refused. The highest offer reached fifteen million.”

Poison Widow feigned curiosity. “Goodness! Such a high price! Why haven’t you sold it yet?”

Xie Lao hadn’t expected her audacious act. “Indeed, I nearly did. But do you know why I hesitated?”

Bill Lin glanced at Luo Bo, who looked to Poison Widow. All three shook their heads.

Xie Lao lowered his voice conspiratorially. “Just as I prepared to sell, the Yang Family contacted me. They promised at least sixteen million if I consigned it to their auction house—a full fifteen million higher than previous offers. Hence, I held back.”

Bill Lin’s heart sank. He’d assumed seizing the initiative by meeting Xie Lao privately would secure a bargain. Instead, prices had already skyrocketed, thanks to the Yangs. At auction, the fragment could fetch thirty million, netting the Yangs over ten million profit—a deal anyone would covet.

Poison Widow dismissed, “You really should sell. This fragment is useless alone. Even as a family heirloom, it’s just worthless scrap unless completed.”

Bill Lin approved silently, exchanging a glance before adding, “We invited you today to discuss your price. If reasonable, I’ll buy it outright, sparing us all further trouble.”

Luo Bo chimed in, “Even if auctioned, our young master would win the bid. No one else could afford it.” The flattery straightened Bill Lin’s posture—yes, wealth defined him.

“I nearly sent it to the Yangs,” Xie Lao sighed, “but their next auction is fortnight away. I can’t wait—I need it sold swiftly.”

He tossed a gnawed chicken bone onto the table. “Since revealing this fragment, hordes have hounded me. Some even broke into my hotel at night to steal my shoes! Disgraceful, no?”

“Outrageous!” Bill Lin declared righteously, though Xie Lao itched to kick his smarmy face. The hypocrisy nauseated even Bill Lin himself, yet he persisted for the deal.

Xie Lao continued, “Danger aside, these days have been luxurious—fine hotels, exquisite wines, all freely given.”

“Our young master can easily provide such comforts,” Poison Widow said. “As with tonight’s feast, you could dine like this daily if he wishes.”

Bill Lin, pleased by her support, added, “Indeed! Visit my estate, and you’ll indulge in delicacies unavailable elsewhere.”

Xie Lao inwardly scoffed at their pretentiousness but smiled. “To show goodwill, I’ll let you inspect the map.”

Bill Lin brightened—this fool was easily manipulated. Perhaps Luo Bo could beat him unconscious later and seize the map.

But they’d forgotten Xie Lao’s feet. As he half-removed his shoe, an unbearable stench flooded the room—worse than any cesspit.

**Chapter 2995: Exquisite Manners**

When the shoe came off fully, Bill Lin and company pressed table linens to their faces, tears streaming. The reek burned their eyes—a testament to its potency.

Poison Widow glimpsed Xie Lao’s socks—the same vile relics from the Flower Night Club incident. They’d become legend.

Xie Lao relished their torment. Slowly, he extracted the map and laid it on the table. “Esteemed guests, behold this genuine treasure fragment! Its central position must be valuable, no?”

Bill Lin dared not breathe. Seconds later, he bolted outside, gasping and weeping. Luo Bo and Poison Widow followed, faces red, tears flowing.

“I’ve truly witnessed the world’s foulest feet today,” Bill Lin croaked.

“Our subordinates warned of the stench,” Luo Bo wheezed. “The photos didn’t do it justice.”

Poison Widow grimaced. “How do we inspect the map now?”

“We can’t abandon it,” Bill Lin insisted. “Fetch perfumes! Maximum ventilation!”

As they ordered servants, a polite attendant approached, discreetly wrinkling his nose at their contaminated stench.

Xie Lao, meanwhile, chuckled alone. He’d worn thick shoes in warm weather, slept in them to intensify the odor—all to torment Bill Lin, Guan Yu’s enemy.

When the trio returned masked and doused in perfume, the hybrid stench made even attendants recoil. Tears streamed behind their goggles as they re-entered.

Bill Lin gestured weakly at the map. One glance near Xie Lao’s feet sent him fleeing again, yelling, “Please wait! I’ll return shortly!”

Outside, he wiped tears—years’ worth shed today. Poison Widow and Luo Bo emerged equally ravaged.

“The map’s genuine,” Bill Lin rasped. “Patterns are clear, central position... but the smell...”

Poison Widow asked, “Do you truly want this reeking fragment?”

Luo Bo reasoned, “If you seek the complete map, you must buy it. Previous investments can’t be wasted.”

Bill Lin nodded. “We’ll display it in a vacuum-sealed case. Now, negotiate the price.”

Re-entering, they found Xie Lao had re-shod, slightly mitigating the stench.

**Chapter 2996: Strategic Positioning**

The trio, now perfumed and masked, steeled themselves. Bill Lin’s eyes still burned, but resolve hardened. This fragment would complete his collection—stench be damned. The game of wealth and pretension continued, layered thick as the cloying perfume battling lingering foulness.
