Grimacing and groaning in pain, the two doctors placed the stretcher beside him. Just as they were about to lift him onto it, the young man suddenly cried out, "Don’t... don’t touch me! It hurts! It’s killing me!"

One of the doctors hesitated at his desperate cries, momentarily frozen. After a moment’s thought, he said, "You’ll have to endure the pain. It’ll get better once we reach the hospital."

The two doctors wasted no further time. One grabbed his shoulders while the other seized his ankles, preparing to hoist him onto the stretcher.

"Ah! It hurts! Hurts!" the young man screamed through clenched teeth. As the doctors stretched him out and finally laid him on the stretcher, he abruptly coughed up a mouthful of blood—thick and clotted with what looked like flecks of flesh.

The surrounding female onlookers shrieked in horror. One doctor, now splattered with blood, cursed in frustration, "Damn it! Couldn’t you aim better?" Without further comment, the two lifted the stretcher.

The wail of the ambulance siren faded into the distance. Guan Yu’s earlier kick had been brutal—even if the young man survived, he wouldn’t recover for at least a year.

Though the ambulance had long departed, the police had yet to arrive. Guan Yu made no attempt to flee, calmly waiting to resolve matters once they appeared.

After an interminable wait, the grating sound of police sirens finally pierced the air.

As the patrol cars pulled up, the female manager sprang to life, rushing forward to declare, "Officers! It’s this man! He attacked someone! The victim’s already been taken by ambulance, but you can see the bloodstains here—the injuries were severe! Arrest him immediately!"

Five officers entered the scene. A portly policeman approached Guan Yu and demanded, "Did you assault someone? Why?"

"No particular reason. Just itching for a fight," Guan Yu replied with a chuckle. Incensed, the manager shrilled, "How dare you act so lawless! If ‘itching for a fight’ justifies violence, then I should—"

"Enough!" the officer cut her off sharply. "Are we handling this investigation, or you? Step back unless you want charges too!"

The manager flushed with anger but dared not confront the officer. "I’m only trying to assist as a witness!"

"We’ll question you when needed. Stay out of the way until then," the officer dismissed her coldly.

Fuming silently, the manager fantasized about kicking the uncooperative policeman. Officers documented the scene with photographs before one addressed Guan Yu: "You’re being charged with intentional assault. Come with us."

At this moment, a girl holding a phone stepped forward. "Officers, would you like to see how he attacked the victim? I recorded everything. I’m an eyewitness—should I accompany you to assist the investigation?"

"Fine. You’re coming too," the officer nodded, adding sternly, "But don’t upload that footage online. Such violent content could incite panic."

"Oh dear, you’re too late," the girl chirped. "I already posted it before you arrived."

The officer grimaced. Though such graphic videos were prohibited, widespread reposts had already occurred. "We’ll deal with that later. Let’s go."

As the police prepared to leave, the manager interjected again: "Officers, let me assist too! I can provide full details of the incident. Isn’t that useful?"

Her true motive was witnessing Guan Yu’s interrogation—the thought of his humiliation brought her vicious satisfaction.

"Unnecessary. We have witnesses. Stay put," the officer rebuffed.

Undeterred, the manager pressed, "I witnessed everything! And I’m connected to the victim—he’s practically my younger brother!"

"Biological brother?"

"Close enough," she lied, hoping fabricated kinship would grant her access.

"If he’s your brother, visit him at the hospital instead," the officer retorted. "Family can’t serve as witnesses—basic legal knowledge. We’ll contact you if needed. Now move!"

As police escorted Guan Yu away, Qu Shuangshuang—recently comforted by Xue Jing—trembled with renewed anxiety, willing to shoulder any blame for him.

Guan Yu trailed the officers nonchalantly. "Xue Jing, take Shuangshuang back to the hospital. I’ll return after settling things at the station."

Xue Jing hesitated, torn between accompanying Guan Yu and protecting the girl. "What if I bring her back first, then join you?"

Guan Yu sighed inwardly—Xue Jing clung like an annoying adhesive plaster. "Fine. Call me after dropping her off. This should resolve quickly."

As police催促 them, Guan Yu added urgently, "Officers won’t escort Shuangshuang—I don’t trust them. Xue Jing, listen to me this time. Nothing will happen—you know my capabilities here."

Reluctantly agreeing, Xue Jing led the weeping Shuangshuang away. "Will Brother Guan go to jail?" the girl sobbed.

"For ordinary people? Yes. But is Guan Yu ordinary?" Xue Jing reassured, though her own mind raced—what if hidden enemies struck while he was vulnerable?

Meanwhile in the patrol car, Guan Yu dialed Yang Conghan. "Conghan, free? I’m being hauled to Kaicheng Precinct for assault. Embarrassing, really."

"You? Arrested?" Yang Conghan’s disbelief crackled through the phone. "Since when do you comply with police?"

"Deliberate choice. Need your pull to spring me quickly."

Within moments, Yang promised to contact the precinct chief. As Guan Yu hung up, the witness girl smirked, "Seems my testimony’s pointless. One call solves everything?"

"Unless you fancy overnight lodging," Guan Yu teased.

Suddenly, the girl whipped out an XM6 shotgun pistol. Chaos erupted—the driver swerved, a deafening blast tore through the roof, and Guan Yu shoved an officer aside to kick open the door. Shield activated, he vanished into crowded streets as the assassin gave chase, cursing when she lost him.

Breathing hard in a mall hideout, Guan Yu cursed his close call—enemies lurked everywhere, even behind sweet smiles.
