Ran Qiang was inciting the crowd, attempting to conquer them with money. Yet to his astonishment, not a single person cursed him. "Fucking hell, these are all brainless idiots! They won't even take free money!"

Liu Hongshuang, witnessing Ran Qiang's shameless behavior, angrily cursed, "What a scoundrel! Utterly despicable!"

"Go to hell, you filthy bitch!" Ran Qiang swung his palm toward Liu Hongshuang's face. Panic flashed in her eyes—she never imagined he'd dare strike even her.

As the crowd gasped, Liu Hongshuang squeezed her eyes shut in terror. At that critical moment, a hand reached from behind her neck and seized Ran Qiang's wrist.

The rescuer was none other than Guan Yu. Heroically saving beauties in distress had always been his style. His earlier feigned weakness merely exposed Ran Qiang's true nature to the public. Having achieved his purpose, Guan Yu now made his grand entrance—the perfect way to impress the ladies.

Many hotel waitresses, pretty young things, gazed at Guan Yu with starry-eyed admiration. This was their prince charming incarnate.

After gripping Ran Qiang's wrist, Guan Yu stepped forward imposingly. His tall, straight-backed figure standing protectively before Liu Hongshuang elicited squeals from surrounding female onlookers.

Looking down coldly at the shorter Ran Qiang from his superior height, Guan Yu declared, "A real man never strikes women—especially not my woman..."

His words provoked another wave of adoring screams. Even middle-aged cleaning aunties were moved, while young waitresses teared up. "If only a man like that existed for me," they thought, "I'd die content."

"Now that's a true man! Compare him to Young Master Ran—what a worthless dog!" muttered a security guard. Even Liu Hongshuang felt genuinely touched, momentarily forgetting this was all an act.

Yet she reminded herself—this was Xue Jing's man. Though merely roleplaying, Liu Hongshuang remained deeply grateful to Guan Yu.

Despite being restrained, Ran Qiang glared viciously. "How dare you touch me! I'm the Ran Family's Young Master!" he snarled, neck tendons bulging.

"You think I can't handle you?" Guan Yu tightened his left hand. A sickening crack echoed as bones snapped, followed by Ran Qiang's howl. Before the scream faded, Guan Yu unleashed a flurry of slaps—over a dozen brutal strikes that left Ran Qiang's face swollen crimson, head lolling drunkenly, even momentarily forgetting his broken wrist.

**Chapter 1860: Disgusting to Death**

The sudden violence shocked spectators into realizing this handsome youth wasn't to be trifled with. Only when his woman was threatened did his fury erupt—the power of love transforming him from seemingly vulnerable to unstoppable.

Security guards made no move to intervene. Given Ran Qiang's vile character, they silently cheered: "Serves him right! That trash deserved worse."

When the slapping ceased, Ran Qiang's face resembled rotten meat—cheeks ballooned, blood trickling from nose and mouth. "Y-you dare...I'll destroy you..." he garbled through swollen lips.

As Ran Qiang swung a wild punch, Guan Yu contemptuously blocked it. A precise jab to the lower back produced an animalistic roar. Ran Qiang's crotch darkened with urine, legs buckling as foul stenches of excrement and rancid flatulence erupted.

The hallway filled with putrid stench. Covering their noses, the crowd recoiled from the soiled wretch. Liu Hongshuang retched against a wall. Guan Yu had secretly used internal energy to disrupt Ran Qiang's bodily functions—a more direct "lesson" than mere acupressure.

"Disgusting! Public defecation? How uncivilized!" Guan Yu mocked, dragging the still-retching Liu Hongshuang downstairs. Cleaning staff cursed their misfortune—the luxury hotel's carpeted corridors now required intensive sanitation.

**Chapter 1861: No Fear of Shame**

After dropping Liu Hongshuang home, Guan Yu returned to find a modified supercar parked outside—christened "Great Voyage" for its thunderous exhaust roar. The customized beast delighted his housemates Ah Mei and Xue Jing.

"Wow Guan Yu, that suit looks amazing!" Xue Jing circled him appraisingly, even inspecting his designer underwear. "From top-brand briefs to socks—did some sugar mommy buy these?"

Blushing, Guan Yu protested, "Ah Mei's here!"

Xue Jing laughed. "Big man scared of being seen? Ah Mei's already seen you naked!" The comment sent Ah Mei fleeing indoors.

Later, driving his flashy Bugatti to school, Guan Yu found his path blocked by black-suited men. "The Ran Patriarch demands your presence."

After brief resistance, Guan Yu allowed himself to be blindfolded and taken to a remote dock. Facing the rotund Ran Patriarch—his son's spitting image—Guan Yu remained defiant.

"Give him some color!" the patriarch ordered. When thugs attacked with baseball bats, Guan Yu disarmed them effortlessly.

"Playing gangster?" Guan Yu sneered. "If you want me dead, do it properly."

The Ran Patriarch rotated his jade ring coldly. "You'll feed the fishes tonight."
