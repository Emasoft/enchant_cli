Siki appeared somewhat at a loss, continuing, "Actually, I never thought that way. I never considered you unworthy of me. Why are you being like this?"

At this moment, the usually ice-cold woman revealed a softer side as she added, "Though I pretend indifference outwardly, I know deep down I care about you deeply. This feeling... I can't control it."

"Just care? Perhaps we aren't even ordinary friends—merely fellow disciples bound by sect ties."

"Actually..." Siki bit her lip. "The truth is... I harbor affection for you in my heart. I simply didn't wish to voice it."

Finally unable to contain herself, Siki poured out her innermost thoughts. After speaking, her face burned as if scorched by flames, yet she felt liberated. "You're exceptional in every way. At times, I even feel inadequate beside you. That's why I often hesitated to express myself."

"Enough," Guan Yu interjected gently. "Let's not dwell on this. I merely wished to convey my feelings earlier. Please don't mind my approach."

Though Siki had resisted Guan Yu's earlier advances, an undercurrent of pleasure lingered. When the man she admired touched her, it felt... right.

Noticing Siki's melancholy shift, Guan Yu deftly changed the subject. "Have you traversed deserts before? Are you familiar with them? When I requested disciples knowledgeable about desert conditions, Master recommended you. He mentioned Elder Dai found you abandoned in the sands as a child?" He paused meaningfully. "If this isn't true, we shouldn't risk your safety needlessly."

**Chapter 4314: Within One’s Capabilities**

"Correct," Siki confirmed. "In my childhood, I was left to perish in the desert. By fortune's twist, Master happened upon me during his travels. He brought me here, took me as his disciple, and raised me."

"Why were you abandoned? How old were you? What of your parents?"

If Siki had merely spent brief childhood years in the desert, her knowledge might be limited to fragmented memories rather than true understanding.

"At ten winters old," Siki continued, her voice steady. "My family dwelled at the desert's edge. Life flowed peacefully until the year the sandstorms came. The tempest devoured our entire village. My parents vanished. Left alone, I became a desert orphan until stumbling into quicksand. By divine fortune, Master rescued me."

"You survived the desert alone at ten? Remarkable!" Guan Yu marveled.

"Survival demanded resilience," Siki replied matter-of-factly. "Endless dunes obscured any homeward path. When hunger gnawed, I ate sand or bird droppings. Thirst drove me to drink avian blood. Occasionally, luck brought travelers who shared provisions."

Guan Yu nodded, newly impressed. For a girl to endure such trials... The desert spared no one, least of all children.

"Such hardships in your youth..." he murmured.

Siki's gaze turned inquisitive. "And you? What of your childhood? Where dwell your parents now?"

"Myself?" A wry smile touched Guan Yu's lips. "My past lies shrouded. After losing my memories, all prior recollections vanished—perhaps due to the cerebral seal. Hence my urgency to break this curse. It consumes my purpose."

"Because of the mental封印 (seal)?"

"Presumably. Without memories, certainty eludes me. Hence this desperate quest for liberation."

Changing tack, Siki inquired, "When do we depart?" Sensitive to having touched a wound, she deftly shifted focus.

"Details remain unsettled. Other arrangements require attention—likely several days more. You may return to Convergence Peak for now."

When Siki lowered her head silently, Guan Yu pressed, "What troubles you? Are you unwell?"

"Nay." She shook her head slowly. "Master bid me acclimate beforehand to ensure readiness. Thus..."

"Thus I'm to assist you with necessary preparations," she concluded simply.

Understanding dawned. Did this mean Siki would remain here until departure? The implication of shared quarters flashed through Guan Yu's mind—an alluring prospect of nights perfumed by her presence, a privilege none else enjoyed.

"Ah. Has Tigerhead Peak prepared chambers for you?" he asked pointedly. "Shall I request Master arrange accommodations?"

At Siki's silent nod, Guan Yu resolved to submit his roster to Xuanming that very afternoon. Once approved, their expedition could commence.

"Siki," he cautioned, "the desert's perils are manifold. Harsh conditions ill-suit women. There's still time to reconsider."

Though longing to declare 'With you, I fear nothing,' Siki demurred: "I believe I can assist significantly. My childhood experience grants desert wisdom."

"So be it." Guan Yu's smile turned cunning. "Others shall join us—Ling Su and Lin Chen. Let them taste the desert's bitterness."

"They'd never consent! Knowing the dangers—quicksand pits and worse—they'd refuse!"

"You misjudge." Guan Yu's eyes glinted. "With your presence as our sect's foremost beauty—the goddess in every male disciple's heart—they'll clamor to join. Your allure guarantees their compliance."

"You exploit me! How wicked!" Siki protested, though her tone lacked conviction.

"Not exploitation—resourcefulness," Guan Yu countered. "Whether they come or not, you'll accompany me regardless, yes?"

At her silent nod, he continued: "Thus their presence becomes... incidental. Rest assured, I'll permit no pestering. Until we reach the sands, I'll humor their pretensions."

**Chapter 4315: Rumors**

"Very well. They're hardly virtuous—fitting punishment for spreading vile rumors," Siki conceded.

Guan Yu's interest sharpened. "Rumors? About me? What falsehoods fermented in my absence?"

Reluctantly, Siki revealed: "They claimed you and Xiao Zhi conspired with the Demonic Soul Sect, framing Senior Brother Yanzao. That your 'secret mission' was flight from justice."

Guan Yu snorted. "Petty slander. Expected from such worms." Though he feigned indifference, the implications rankled—such lies could tarnish reputations.

Unspoken between them lingered Siki's private fears during his absence—nights haunted by visions of Guan Yu as traitor or corpse. Only his recent triumphant return with Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun of Bamboo Peak had silenced the calumnies, restoring his honor.

When Elder Lu of Convergence Peak summoned her for the desert mission, Siki had accepted instantly, heedless of danger. Two interminable days later, she'd sought pretext to visit Tigerhead Peak early, feigning operational preparation while secretly yearning for reunion.

Now, facing him, her composure wavered—the giddy disquiet of confronting one's idol after prolonged absence.

"They've no ties to me," Siki argued. "No sane man would choose peril when comfort abounds here."

Guan Yu chuckled. "All Cloud Azure Sect's men are tied to you—our peerless beauty, the goddess haunting every disciple's dreams. Those two especially. Your presence transforms danger into coveted opportunity."

**Chapter 4316: Twenty Should Suffice**

After days of preparation, Wang Jun's crossbow arsenal stood complete—excessively so.

"You needn't carry so many bolts," Guan Yu advised. "The weight's impractical. This exceeds necessity."
