He was asking a question he already knew the answer to. The fact that so many had arrived at once clearly indicated they came prepared. Moreover, everyone living here had committed varying degrees of wrongdoing – their list of enemies grew longer by the day.

"Today we're here for two purposes," Jin Hua announced cheerfully, thoroughly enjoying the horrified expression on the bearded man's face. She couldn't help imagining how amusing it would be to keep Second Only to Wolf leashed beside her, unleashing him occasionally to scare people. The thought alone made her want to chuckle.

Of course, she dared not voice this fantasy aloud. The idea of treating a top-tier expert like Second Only to Wolf as some guard dog to be paraded around? If he ever discovered such notions, either he'd die from rage or she'd be annihilated instantly.

"What purposes? Spit it out!"

"Y-yes! If we can resolve this peacefully, there's no need for violence."

"Exactly! Casualties would be catastrophic if we fight. Our lives may be worthless, but your men's lives aren't easily replaced!"

The crowd's earlier bravado had evaporated, replaced by clamoring for peaceful resolution. Their reasoning held merit – even if Jin Hua's side could prevail through Second Only to Wolf's strength, the bloodshed would be immense. Avoiding conflict remained preferable if possible.

"Very well," Jin Hua declared loudly. "Our first demand is to release everyone in those iron cages behind you."

These prisoners had been kidnapped or swindled from various nations – innocent people all. Hearing Jin Hua's demand, the captors exchanged uneasy glances, uncertain how to proceed. Releasing these captives meant destroying their livelihood. Their entire organization's expenses relied on trained prisoners sent out to steal, rob, and swindle.

Without this income stream, these parasites would have to personally engage in criminal activities – a prospect none relished.

"What's your second demand?" the bearded man barked. He already knew the first condition was unacceptable – releasing their "livestock" meant financial ruin. Yet their current predicament offered no good options. If the second demand proved equally unreasonable, violence became inevitable. Secretly, the bearded man hoped for chaos to facilitate his escape.

"First things first," Jin Hua countered. "Without resolving the primary issue, there's no point discussing the second."

The bearded man's face twisted in frustration. Dying here served no purpose – with his skills, surviving outside remained feasible. Many shared his survivalist mindset.

A long-haired man stepped forward. "Let's agree to her first condition, then hear the second before deciding. What say you?"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd. Seizing the momentum, the bearded man declared, "Fine! We'll release them. Now state your second demand."

Jin Hua blossomed into a radiant smile. "First, open all cages. Let each keyholder unlock their own prisoners. Then we'll discuss the second matter."

"Damn crafty wench," the bearded man muttered under his breath.

Though feeling increasingly cornered, the captors complied. Jin Hua's true motive became clear – this saved Ah Cai the labor of breaking countless locks. While Second Only to Wolf could easily shatter them all, the proud expert would never stoop to such menial tasks.

As keys jingled and three-tiered cages along the west wall creaked open, few prisoners emerged. Those who did – Ah Cai observed – appeared thoroughly brainwashed, likely veterans of criminal missions and fiercely loyal to their captors.

**Chapter 2308: Negotiations (Conclusion)**

"Excellent cooperation," Jin Hua praised. "Given your compliance, perhaps we can avoid bloodshed today. You've seen our expert's capabilities." She paused meaningfully, noting how all eyes flicked toward Second Only to Wolf.

"Truthfully, we act on another's behalf. To fulfill our mission..." Her voice turned icy. "...you must select representatives. Bring their heads as proof, and the rest may live. You have ten minutes to decide."

Silence descended. Jin Hua's "merciful" offer sparked paranoid glances among the captors. Partners became potential threats as everyone guarded against betrayal. This psychological warfare eroded their combat readiness more effectively than any blade.

When ten minutes expired without volunteers, Jin Hua feigned disappointment. "Since none wish to sacrifice, I'll amend the terms: Kill one comrade to spare yourself. Kill two, walk free immediately."

Even Second Only to Wolf and Ganbili stared at Jin Hua with newfound respect. The seemingly naive girl had masterfully turned the crowd against itself.

Chaos erupted instantly. The bearded man swung his warhammer at a nearby middle-aged man, crushing his chest before turning to another target. Mid-swing, his hammer froze – then dropped onto his own skull as a knife found his back.

"Excellent!" Jin Hua applauded the backstabber. "Kill another and you're free!"

The compound dissolved into brutal infighting. Ganbili's men watched in awe while Second Only to Wolf intercepted escapees with lethal efficiency. One portly man fell with Second Only to Wolf's blade through his heart.

"But...I killed two..." the dying man gasped.

"Apologies," Second Only to Wolf shrugged. "I assumed you were fleeing. Next time, announce yourself first."

Jin Hua facepalmed. "Next time? He'll need another lifetime!"

**Chapter 2309: No Chance Remains**

As Second Only to Wolf mourned his "accident," a sharp voice cut through the chaos: "They're lying! Even if you kill two, they'll still slaughter us!" The speaker pointed at the wrongly killed man. "This is divide-and-conquer! Unite or die!"

The crowd hesitated. Though late, the logic resonated. Nearly a third lay dead already. Their remaining forces stood little chance against Second Only to Wolf's might.

"Fight and maybe live! Surrender and certainly die!" the agitator rallied.

Jin Hua countered coldly: "Do you truly believe anyone can escape a first-class expert's watch? If a single flea slips past, he'd be no better than trash!"

Second Only to Wolf pretended not to hear the insult, suddenly engrossed in ceiling inspection. Ganbili broke the tension: "Guan Yu alerted the authorities. We can't delay."

The revelation sealed their fate – time and numbers both against them, the captors' rebellion collapsed before it began.
