As he spoke, Du Teng fetched a gold ingot and tossed it into the air. Swinging his sword with both hands, he cleaved the ingot cleanly in two midair. The crowd gasped in astonishment.

Guan Yu remarked in surprise, "Such power! What material is this sword made of? It's utterly miraculous!"

"I don't know its forging secrets," Du Teng replied, sheathing his blade. "Twenty years ago, the Dragon-Slaying Gang's leader wielded this Dragon-Slaying Sword. He stood peerless in the martial world then - few could withstand three strikes from this blade. Its edge parts steel like mud. Merely glimpsing this weapon made seasoned warriors tremble."

Guan Yu chuckled, stroking the sword's worn hilt. "Brother Du, if this treasure pleases you, take it as your own."

"This... this isn't proper..." Du Teng mumbled, though his eyes remained fixed on the weapon.

Wang Xiaorong giggled, "Oh come now! The entire Swordless Villa belongs to Guan Yu now. Why stand on ceremony?"

Zhenxiang cautioned, "Though peerless, this blade's fame may bring danger. Many would covet it - best keep it hidden from greedy eyes."

Her warning proved wise. The sword's notoriety demanded caution. The group continued exploring the secret chamber, uncovering more artifacts from the legacy of Swordless Immortal. While gold and jewels abounded, most relics were too conspicuous for common use.

Guan Yu eyed weapon materials that could craft powerful crossbows. "These shall wait for future projects," he mused.

Returning to the inn, Du Teng bid farewell. "Brother Guan, our Swordless Villa adventure shall remain etched in memory. Now Zhenxiang and I must return home."

"May your days overflow with joy," Wang Xiaorong blessed them, handing over a jade vial. "Here's antidote for your Blood Toxin. Take one each full moon to suppress it."

The Left Envoy had delivered ample doses earlier. When questioned about the request, Wang Xiaorong concealed Du Teng's condition - better the sect remained ignorant of this vulnerability.

"Thank you," Zhenxiang said tearfully. "Meeting you both has been Ah-Teng's fortune."

After their departure, Wang Xiaorong turned to Guan Yu. "Old Cang, do you think Du Teng truly controls his Blood Toxin?"

"Likely true," Guan Yu replied, reverting to his disguised appearance. "Martial artists strengthen body and will. With his cultivation, containing the toxin seems feasible."

They found Xiao Zhi and Wang Jun waiting anxiously. "We nearly organized a funeral procession!" Wang Jun exclaimed.

Xiao Zhi shook his head. "Swordless Villa's deathtrap swallowed countless experts! Yet you stroll out unscathed?"

Guan Yu shrugged. "We merely took a scenic walk."

"Tell us everything!" Wang Jun pressed.

"Want to know?" Wang Xiaorong teased. "I won't tell..."

Chapter 4168: Three Treasures Men Cherish

Prince Zou's summons interrupted them. In the royal chambers, the prince probed: "Old Cang, did you best Swordless Immortal?"

"Never met him," Guan Yu deflected. "His servants claimed he'd accepted two challengers already. We argued till sunset but gained no audience."

Prince Zou chuckled. "Perhaps you frightened him! Rest now. We depart tomorrow if rain holds."

Later, advisors debated Guan Yu's motives. "Why help us unconditionally?" Zou Wuxiao suspicious.

"He could kill us all effortlessly if malicious," Zou Wuhui countered. "Let sleeping dragons lie."

In his chambers, Guan Yu contemplated Swordless Immortal's legacy. "Gold, martial secrets... and beauties," Wang Xiaorong added slyly. "Men's third treasure."

Guan Yu smiled. "The immortal ensured successors would maintain his legend. That 'Second Brother' nearly inherited everything, until..."

Their discussion turned to mysterious snake attacks in the peach forest. "No matter now," Guan Yu dismissed, examining the Swordless Command Token. "This must stay hidden."

Chapter 4169: Ominous Skies

Dawn revealed brooding clouds pregnant with unshed rain. "We risk being stranded if storms hit mountain paths," Prince Zou fretted.

Zou Wuxiao argued, "No rain yesterday - perhaps today stays dry. We'll reach official roads by noon."

As preparations commenced, Wang Xiaorong served Guan Yu breakfast. "The prince insists on departing. Madness in this weather!"

Guanå®‡ observed leaden skies. "Deluge awaits. But the prince's word rules."

Elsewhere, Zou Wuxiao stole forbidden drinks in the kitchen. A shadowy figure approached. "When will you strike?"

"Soon," the drunken guard slurred, gathering food parcels. "Wait for my signal."

The looming storm mirrored gathering intrigues as the caravan prepared to brave both natural and human tempests.
