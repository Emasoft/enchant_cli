“Damn it, you little brat. Just you wait. We’ll settle this once we’re off the plane.” The fat man muttered under his breath while Guan Yu wasn’t looking.

Guan Yu, whose hearing far surpassed ordinary people, naturally caught every word. Yet he paid it no mind. Such small fry weren’t worth his attention.

What puzzled him was why the girl beside him seemed familiar.

“You don’t remember me, do you?” The girl spoke up, as if reading his thoughts.

Guan Yu nodded. He was certain he’d seen her before but couldn’t place where.

“I’m Song Xiaoya (Dawn Elegance). We met once at a bar.”

A bar! After a moment’s recollection, it clicked. She was the bar waitress harassed by Li Yu’s lackeys when he’d visited the bar with Jiang Ziqi last time. He’d found her oddly spirited back then, cracking jokes even in such a dire situation.

Yet now, barely any time later, her transformation was stark. Thick makeup obscured her former innocent schoolgirl appearance.

Noticing his scrutiny, Song Xiaoya shifted uncomfortably. “My... family has troubles. That’s why I...” Her eyes flickered toward the fat man.

No need to guess—the old tale of desperate measures. Selling her body to survive.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly but asked no further. “What will you do after landing?”

“I... don’t know.” She bowed her head.

Her passport and documents were with the fat man. Without help, she’d face deportation—and lose the promised million-dollar payment for accompanying him to Taiwan. Without that money, her mother’s illness...

Regret gnawed at her. If only she hadn’t slapped him earlier when he tried to kiss her.

Guan Yu read her thoughts but stayed silent. Though her beauty rivaled Dongfang Huowu’s, he wasn’t some lust-driven stallion. They were strangers, his past rescues mere coincidences.

He had no intention of helping—until she suddenly asked, “Sir, I never caught your name.”

“Guan Yu.”

“Are you here on business or vacation?”

“Business.”

After a hesitation, she blurted, “Since you’re alone... would you need a travel companion?” Her face flushed crimson.

“Companion?” Guan Yu chuckled, eyeing her amusedly. “Offering your services?”

Straightening defiantly, she declared, “Yes!”

His gaze flicked downward briefly. “Tempting, but unnecessary.”

“Unnecessary?” The rejection stung. Did she truly lack all appeal?

“However,” he added, “I’ll help. State your troubles.”

Her despair shattered into hope. “You mean it?”

“Speak now or I rescind the offer.”

“My mother’s critically ill!” The words tumbled out. She’d struck a deal with the fat man—two weeks in Taiwan for a loan to save her mother.

“A loan?” Guan Yu scoffed at the fat man’s stinginess.

Song Xiaoya revealed darker layers: her father, a wealthy hotel tycoon allied with the Song family, had abandoned them. As his illegitimate child, she and her mother were shunned.

“Work for me,” Guan Yu proposed. “Excel in financial management, and the million becomes your salary.”

Her eyes lit up. A chance to hone her skills while saving her mother!

As the plane landed, the fat man regained bravado. “You’ll regret coming to Taiwan, boy!”

Song Xiaoya clung to Guan Yu’s arm.

Smirking, Guan Yu retorted, “Try keeping me here if you can.”

——

At the airport, Lin Dong’s grim expression signaled disaster. “Li Xi’s been kidnapped.”

Guan Yu’s blood ran cold. Wan Qianshan had made his move.

Confronting the traitor’s headquarters, Guan Yu disabled thugs posing as staff. Surveillance cameras captured his ruthless efficiency—a warning to Wan Qianshan watching above.

“This time,” the betrayer hissed, “Taiwan is my domain. You won’t leave alive!”

But Guan Yu’s smile promised retribution. The game had just begun.
