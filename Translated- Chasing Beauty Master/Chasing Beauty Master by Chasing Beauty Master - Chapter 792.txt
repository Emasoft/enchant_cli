Golden Flower shot Guanyu an exasperated glare, her piercing gaze instantly unsettling him. For some inexplicable reason, she appeared increasingly alluring today—every gesture and expression stirred his heart.

“You’ve lived here this long and still don’t know about Ma Hai? Unbelievable.” She proceeded to recount Ma Hai’s exploits, detailing how Li Yuan had enlisted this Realm Venerable expert—equivalent to a mid-tier First Venerable—to target him.

“Moreover,” she added, “Ma Hai is the true mastermind behind the Dark Organization.”

Guanyu’s eyes widened. So this explained Li Baitian’s audacious smuggling operations at the docks—he’d been shielded by such a powerhouse. Yet while they grasped the enemy’s broad scheme, the specifics required deeper investigation.

“What’s your plan now? How can I help?”

A sweet smile bloomed across Golden Flower’s face. She’d known Guanyu would aid her—with his support, even collapsing heavens held no fear. Lighting another cigarette, she blew smoke into his face.

Guanyu inhaled the strangely fragrant haze, his gaze involuntarily drifting to the twin peaks of her snow-white décolletage. An irrational urge to devour them surged through him...

“This brat’s resolve is formidable,” Golden Flower mused. “Two cigarettes smoked, yet he still resists pouncing.”

Her special blend contained hallucinogens designed to provoke lustful delirium. Normally, a single stick could reduce a room of men to beasts. Yet Guanyu had barely reacted until her second cigarette neared its end.

Between her beauty and the thickening miasma, Guanyu finally snapped. Drool trailed from his lips as he lunged, hands clawing at her bosom.

“I’ll ruin you!” he slurred, initiating frenzied motions punctuated by Golden Flower’s shrill cry.

She reveled in the act. Her scheme to intoxicate Guanyu served dual purposes: securing protection through intimacy, and indulging desires kindled since their first encounter at Huaye Club.

When sobriety returned, Guanyu remained oblivious to the manipulation. Horrified by the virginal bloodstains on the sofa, he stammered apologies—another innocent violated.

Curled defensively in a corner, Golden Flower clutched her torn garments. With Zhang Han’s bloodstains still marring the furniture, this fresh scandal left Guanyu scratching his head in dismay.

**Chapter Two Thousand and Nine: Cannot Reveal Oneself**

“This must remain secret,” Golden Flower declared. “I’ll be your shadow lover—no titles needed.” Her motives were pragmatic: securing a protector while harboring unspoken affection.

Guanyu’s suspicions ignited when examining the cigarette butt. As a master of intoxicants, Golden Flower had easily laced her smoke—yet he bore responsibility regardless.

Their subsequent entanglement revealed her Bone Shrinking Art’s prowess, her body’s contractions heightening his ecstasy. Though now exposed, Golden Flower maintained composure: “I acted willingly. Even as a nameless lover, I’m content.”

“You’ll suffer no indignities,” Guanyu vowed. “But for now, stay hidden. Exposure endangers us both.”

Their embrace renewed as Golden Flower disclosed her clan’s remnants—a covert faction awaiting recovered wealth to strike the Four Great Families. Guanyu secured her in a secluded safehouse known only to them.

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guanyu found the bloodstained sofa reupholstered in pink—evidence discovered by Xue Jing and A’mei.

“Where were you all night?!” Xue Jing accosted during dinner, while Zhang Han sniffed suspiciously: “Uncle’s got strange perfume! He met a woman!”

Guanyu deflected with talk of investigating Zhang Han’s bodily seal, warning her: “Never speak of this封印 to anyone.”

Xue Jing’s interrogation about the bloodstain prompted Guanyu’s clumsy nosebleed excuse, exaggerated by Zhang Han’s eager corroboration—a transparent lie that went unchallenged.

**Chapter Two Thousand and Ten: Serpent’s Gaze**

At Huaye Club, Hou Jinshun updated Guanyu: “Li Zhiming ‘sold’ shares to Ma Hai but actually became his subordinate under debt duress.”

Their discussion of Ma Hai’s alliance with three families (Yang, Lü, and Chengmao Chen) was interrupted by a drunken patron demanding prostitutes. When refused, his snake-eyed disciple attacked bartenders with dagger flourishes reminiscent of Yang Conghan’s style.

The youth’s serpentine pupils and lethal precision halted Hou Jinshun’s men mid-conflict. “Find women for my master,” he hissed in a child’s voice, blade glinting, “or bleed out your staff.”

**Chapter Two Thousand and Eleven: Disinclined to Act**

Guanyu observed coldly as Hou Jinshun contained the situation. The disciple’s reptilian gaze and bladed whirlwind evoked Yang Conghan’s techniques—a connection demanding investigation. Yet for now, the club’s drama warranted mere spectatorship.
