Ling Su might not be a good person, but at least he wasn't as pretentious as Lin Chen, nor did he possess Lin Chen's constant scheming nature.

After ascending the platform, the duel commenced. Aze spoke first, "Senior Brother Ling Su, I know your cultivation is profound. Though I may not be your match, I've come prepared today. You'd best be cautious."

Ling Su sneered, "You ignorant brat! Let's see what tricks you've got, daring to boast before me. You're courting death!"

"Of course I dare boast before you. While I lack other skills, I've many methods to defeat you. In the past, I might not have dared face you, but now that I have Guan Yu as a friend, even if I lose today, I'll just have him stab through your wrist later to vent my anger. Hahaha!"

These words had all been taught to Aze by Guan Yu. Upon entering the arena, he must provoke Ling Su by targeting his weaknesses and humiliating secrets to enrage him and expose flaws.

"You're spouting nonsense!" Ling Su roared. "Guan Yu ambushed me last time! Do you think he could defeat me fairly?"

"Oh?" Aze feigned surprise. "Senior Brother Ling Su, you sound so confident! Did it hurt terribly when your wrist was pierced last time? I heard the pain made you wet yourself. Has that injury healed yet?"

The disciples below erupted in laughter upon hearing Ling Su had wet himself, particularly those from Xuansong Peak, who jeered loudest under Xiao Zhi's instigation.

Ling Su never imagined such a shameful incident would be exposed in this grand setting. Yet this Aze seemed intent on courting death—the first in Yunqing Sect bold enough to publicly slander him.

"Lies! Don't listen to Guan Yu's fabrications! That never happened!" Ling Su pointed furiously at Guan Yu in the crowd. "Guan Yu, you bastard! When did I ever wet myself?"

Guan Yu shrugged nonchalantly, wearing an infuriating grin.

Aze continued, "Senior Brother, could you show us the scar on your wrist? I heard it was pierced clean through. Ah, just thinking of it pains me."

Ling Su glared murderously, wishing to devour Aze whole. Seeing Ling Su's rage, Aze knew half his plan had succeeded. The moment Ling Su attacked recklessly would be his opportunity.

"I also heard," Aze drawled, "that when Senior Brother visited Juhua Peak to invite Siqi out, you couldn't even enter the main gate. On your return, a wild dog chased you through the woods and tore off your pants! Hahaha! Isn't that hilarious?"

The crowd's laughter swelled into raucous discussion.

Ling Su bellowed, "Aze! You seek death today! Your words alone warrant execution!" He never imagined Aze would unearth this most humiliating incident, known only to a few sect members years ago.

"Don't rush, Senior Brother. I've another amusing tale to share." Aze spoke leisurely. "Though this one's rather delicate... Rumor says that wild dog bit off your crotch? Hah! Are you even a man anymore? Is this true?"

The crowd exploded in scandalized chatter:

"Ling Su lost his...?"

"So he's a eunuch now? Serves the villain right!"

"Hah! The mighty Ling Su bested by a stray dog!"

Amidst the cruel jibes, Ling Su's temples bulged. "Bastard! DIE!" Abandoning incantations, he drew his Yunqing Sword and charged.

Aze had anticipated this. Drawing his own sword, he parried Ling Su's frenzied slashes while secretly channeling spiritual energy. Their blades clashed in metallic screeches as Ling Su exhausted himself with wild strikes.

Suddenly, blue light erupted from Aze's sword, striking Ling Su's chest. Staggering back, Ling Su gasped, "You cast without incantations?!"

"Who said I didn't chant?" Aze mocked. "I recited through my 'third leg'—though pity you lack one now!"

"YOUR LIFE ENDS HERE!" Ling Su roared, face contorted.

From the sidelines, Elder Xuanming shook his head—Ling Su had already lost the moment he abandoned spellcraft for brute force.

Ultimately, Aze emerged victorious using techniques taught by Second-to-Wolf, though his arm bore a gash from Ling Su's blade. Had the Yunqing Sword been sharper, the enraged strike might have severed the limb.

As the crowd dispersed, Ling Su sat alone on the platform, ignored by all. Xuanming sighed ruefully at his disciple's disgrace.

**Chapter 3315: A New Mission**

The four victors—Guan Yu, Siqi, Xiao Zhi, and Aze—were summoned to Tiger Head Peak's grand hall with all sect elders.

"Congratulations," Xuanming intoned from his elevated seat. "As our sect's elite disciples, you'll receive magical artifacts and enlightenment from the Merit Cauldron. Afterwards, you'll investigate the demonic sect's mobilization at Qujiang City and rendezvous with Senior Brother Yanzhao."

Xiao Zhi and Aze vibrated with excitement at leaving sect confines, while Guan Yu resigned himself to accompanying Siqi.

Elder Lu explained, "The demonic faction gathers forces secretly. Though routed by righteous sects a century ago, they've regrouped. Your mission is crucial."

When Xuanming attempted to withhold promised artifacts from Guan Yu and Siqi, Elder Dai protested until both declined graciously—Guan Yu wielding his Wind and Thunder Staff, Siqi her superior Jade Ruyi.

Xiao Zhi claimed a spirit-writing brush, Aze a bronze lock—their jubilant prancing contrasting Guan Yu's eye-rolling remark: "Must you two act like children? Siqi didn't preen this much when she got the Ruyi."

**Chapter 3316: Choosing Treasures**

As the quartet prepared for their journey, Xuanming admonished, "Exercise utmost caution. The demonic sect's schemes must be thwarted, but do not act rashly."

Siqi hesitated—venturing with three men conflicted with her preferences, yet duty compelled compliance. Meanwhile, Guan Yu's thoughts lingered on the mysterious Second-to-Wolf, whose combat teachings had proven invaluable.

The stage was set for a mission that would test their skills and unity, unwittingly placing them at the forefront of an impending storm that threatened both sect and mortal realms.
