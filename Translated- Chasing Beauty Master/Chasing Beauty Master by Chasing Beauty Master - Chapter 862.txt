Ling'er said softly, “Brother Guan is right. The reason is that I overthink things, and in my own view, I feel unworthy of Brother Guan. I cherish our current relationship as siblings—him being my elder brother and me his younger sister.”

Shuangshuang, indignant on Ling'er's behalf, retorted, “Sister Ling'er, if I were you, I'd demand a proper position by Handsome Brother's side—one with both status and recognition! You clearly love him in your heart, so why torment yourself like this?”

Shuangshuang spoke truth. Ling'er's heart indeed held Guan Yu, and apart from Aunt Qing and her husband, Guan Yu occupied her every thought. Yet she refused to disrupt their current dynamic, unwilling to accept more favors from him. She believed she owed him too much already. Even if she could stay by his side, Ling'er considered herself fit only as his servant or caretaker.

Seeking to divert the conversation, the quick-witted Ling'er teased, “Oh Shuangshuang, have you taken a fancy to Brother Guan? Shall I play matchmaker for you?”

Without hesitation, Shuangshuang declared, “Of course I admire Handsome Brother! He's the Prince Charming of my dreams!” She scampered to Ling'er's side, adding, “If you help arrange this, Sister Ling'er, I'll be eternally grateful once Handsome Brother and I become a couple.”

Auntie chided with laughter, “Enough, Shuangshuang! Have you no shame as a proper young lady?”

“What's wrong with that? I'm already grown! The Wang girl from our backyard married a year younger than me. Why can't I pursue romance?” Shuangshuang protested indignantly.

Indeed, rural marriages occurred early, especially for girls—most wed around eighteen, some even younger.

“Guan Yu, Meimei has set her heart on you! Give me a straight answer—yes or no?” Qu Meimei marched forward, finger pointed at Guan Yu's nose in mock threat, her comically fierce posture suggesting she might brawl if refused.

Guan Yu's mind churned with dilemma. A refusal might send Shuangshuang storming off again, barely pacified after recent efforts. This predicament proved truly vexing.

After prolonged hesitation under everyone's expectant gaze—particularly Shuangshuang's eager stare—Guan Yu finally smiled. “This matter is rather delicate. As you all know, I already have several women in my life. While I'm fond of Shuangshuang, she's truly too young. Don't you agree?”

Auntie and Uncle remained silent. Securing Guan Yu as son-in-law would elevate the Qu family's status. Though having known him only an afternoon, Auntie recognized his integrity and kindness. Should Shuangshuang follow him, she'd surely be well cared for.

“So do you agree or not? All this talking amounts to nothing!” Qu Meimei pressed impatiently.

Realizing they demanded resolution tonight, Guan Yu sought help through pleading glances—first at Ling'er, who ignored him, then at Aunt Qing.

Noticing his distress yet uncertain of his true intentions, Aunt Qing advised, “Guan Yu, child, speak your honest mind. Whether yes or no, answer according to your heart.”

Cornered, Guan Yu proposed, “Perhaps we should postpone this discussion. In a few days when Auntie comes to the city for treatment, Shuangshuang can visit my place frequently. If she adapts well, she may stay. If not, she's free to leave anytime.” His implication being time might diminish her affection.

Misinterpreting completely, Shuangshuang threw herself at Guan Yu, planting a kiss on his cheek amidst the crowd. “So you agree! Does this make us fiancés now?” she squealed. Caught off guard, Guan Yu could only nod resignedly.

Attempting escape, Guan Yu suggested, “It's getting late. Shouldn't we retire? The wine's making me drowsy.”

Auntie started, “Right! It's past eleven! Guan Yu needs to escort Meimei to her wedding tomorrow at dawn. We mustn't delay!”

Sleeping arrangements proved challenging in the spacious yet sparsely furnished Qu residence. Auntie and Uncle took their usual room, while Aunt Qing and Ling'er settled on the heated kang bed in the inner chamber.

Guan Yu was led to the west room—normally used for storage. Crates and a double bed occupied the floor, while the kang held stacked luggage and clothing. A narrow space had been cleared on the kang with fresh bedding, clearly prepared for him.

“Please pardon our humble arrangements,” Auntie apologized, indicating the kang.

“Not at all. This is perfectly adequate,” Guan Yu assured, though the rock-hard surface promised sleeplessness. The adjacent bed, intended for Meimei and Shuangshuang, remained vacant.

Lying restlessly, Guan Yu heard Uncle whisper, “Do you think he can sleep? City folk aren't used to kang beds.”

“He's a good lad. Our fortune to have his help with Meimei's wedding,” Auntie murmured.

“But accepting 20,000 yuan as wedding gift! How will we reciprocate when he weds his multiple partners?” Uncle worried.

“We'll return equivalent gifts for his first marriage. Subsequent ones with smaller amounts,” Auntie reasoned pragmatically.

Their conversation turned to Shuangshuang's prospects. “If she marries Guan Yu, she'll live in luxury,” Uncle mused.

“True, but sharing him with others...” Auntie sighed. “Still, meeting someone like him is rare fortune.”

Their discussion soon gave way to amorous rustling, leaving Guan Yu more wakeful. Nearby, the sisters lay motionless but awake.

“Handsome Brother...” Shuangshuang's whisper pierced the dark.

“Yes?” Guan Yu breathed back.

“Can't sleep. Is the kang too hard?”

“Like lying on stone.”

“Country life differs from city beds,” Shuangshuang commiserated, fingers brushing his hair through the darkness. “Why not join me here? There's space.”

Noting Meimei's deliberate shift away, Guan Yu countered, “The bed's cramped. Come up here instead.”

Shuangshuang instantly wriggled into his blanket. “Just talking! No touching!” she warned, though their pressed bodies left little room for accident.

“School life—should I transfer you to the city?” Guan Yu offered.

“But then I'd rarely see my parents...” Her protest dissolved into a gasp. “You touched me!”

“Unavoidable in this space,” Guan Yu feigned innocence, though his wandering hand betrayed him.

Another gasp. “That's my...!”

“Merely adjusting position,” he maintained, testing boundaries as Meimei pretended sleep nearby.

Thus passed the long night—a dance of whispered confessions, accidental brushes, and suppressed laughter beneath the watchful dark.
