“Just as he was thinking this, the waiter from earlier returned and said politely, ‘Sir, that young lady told you to get lost—the farther the better.’ Clearly angered, the waiter deliberately exaggerated her words.

Zhao Zhenwang’s heart sank. Shooting a disdainful glance at Wan Badan, he thought, *This guy was all bluster earlier, but now he’s been humiliated. He’s even fooled around with my woman. Let’s see how he digs himself out of this.*

‘What? She told me to get lost? Damn it, she’s got a death wish! I’ll send someone to drag her here right now. Let’s see if she dares speak to me like that again!’ Wan Badan erupted in fury.

Having cleverly delivered the message, the waiter swiftly retreated. Zhao Zhenwang watched the man’s seething expression with hidden amusement and added fuel to the fire. ‘Director Wan, it seems she’s completely ignoring you.’ As he spoke, he subtly winked at Xiaowei.

Taking the cue, Xiaowei chimed in, ‘Yeah, who does she think she is to disrespect Director Wan like this? What kind of big shot is she?’

Wan Badan leaped to his feet. ‘Screw this! I’ll go see for myself who dares slight me. If she keeps acting up, I’ll arrest her!’ He stormed out, followed closely by Zhao Zhenwang and Xiaowei.

Fuming, Wan Badan located Private Room No. 2. Before even reaching the door, he began cursing. ‘You bitch! I invited you for a drink as a favor—a damn honor! How dare you disrespect me? You’ve got a death wish…’ Reaching the door, he kicked it open and barged in.

The timid Amei inside screamed in fright, drawing everyone’s attention.

Zhao Zhenwang followed him in, his eyes widening at the sight of the room full of stunning women. It was like stepping into a kingdom of beauties—each more captivating than the last. Even Xiaowei, trailing behind, felt a pang of jealousy as her gaze swept over the crowd. *No wonder the boss was entranced. That woman in white is breathtaking.*

Xue Jing slammed the table and stood up angrily. ‘What’s the meaning of this? Looking for trouble?’ Wan Badan scanned the room, his eyes finally landing on Lin Qiaoqiao, who glared back furiously.

‘Qiaoqiao? Why are you here?’ Wan Badan stammered, flustered. Lin Qiaoqiao was the youngest, most promising, and most beautiful police officer at the headquarters.

Countless men in the bureau pursued her, and even her fiery temperament endeared her to everyone—Wan Badan included. He had showered her with attention inside and outside work, but she never gave him an inch. The more she resisted, the more obsessed he became. To men like him, the unattainable was the most tempting.

Wan Badan had redoubled his efforts to win her over, but her natural charisma and strong personality had earned her the nickname ‘The Police Force’s Queen’ among colleagues.

‘Deputy Director Wan, I never expected you to barge in so brainlessly. Did you think this would make you look impressive?’ Lin Qiaoqiao said coldly.

Seeing the tension, Zhao Zhenwang stepped forward to play peacemaker. ‘Director Wan, so you know each other? Perfect! Let’s all sit down for drinks—my treat today.’

But Wan Badan’s mind raced. He’d always portrayed himself as a model superior officer to Lin Qiaoqiao, especially nurturing a kind, responsible image. Now, that facade lay shattered.

*I could slap myself right now,* he thought bitterly. ‘Y-yes, this is my colleague… You can call her Qiaoqiao,’ he stuttered.

‘A colleague means she’s your subordinate? So you’re the famous police beauty! Pleasure to meet you, Qiaoqiao.’ Zhao Zhenwang’s eyes gleamed as he extended a hand. *Even if I don’t get the woman in white today, bagging this stunning officer would make this trip worthwhile. What luck!*

Lin Qiaoqiao ignored Zhao Zhenwang, her gaze fixed on Wan Badan. His previously admirable image as a mentor had now crumbled completely. *At least I’ve seen his true colors before it was too late,* she thought.

‘Now I see everything you showed me was fake. You’re just a cunning fox. Must’ve been exhausting maintaining that act—finally revealed your true self.’

**Chapter 2,444: Sit Down for a Drink**

‘I don’t want explanations. Deputy Director Wan, is having dinner here today illegal?’ Lin Qiaoqiao snapped, cutting him off.

Wan Badan seethed. He’d meant to show off in front of Zhao Zhenwang but had instead alienated the woman he coveted. Just yesterday, he’d schemed to credit her with a major case achievement to win her favor. All that effort—wasted.

Zhao Zhenwan, sensing danger, intervened again. ‘This is all a misunderstanding! Director Wan had too much to drink. Officer, don’t take it personally—men have tempers…’

Guanyu, observing Zhao Zhenwang’s slimy demeanor, remarked coldly, ‘Such a high-end hotel, yet they can’t keep flies out. Ruins the appetite.’

Wan Badan, already humiliated, exploded at Guanyu. ‘Who the hell do you think you are? This is none of your business!’

Guanyu stood, towering over Wan Badan. ‘So the fly bites? Think being a deputy director makes you invincible? Get lost now, or I’ll make you.’

Guanyu held back only because harming Wan Badan might affect Lin Qiaoqiao’s career. But his patience wore thin.

Drunk and enraged, Wan Badan drew his service pistol. ‘You bastard! I’ll blow your head off!’

The room froze. Xue Jing tensed—bullets didn’t discriminate.

Lin Qiaoqiao shouted, ‘Deputy Director! Brandishing a weapon like this—have you forgotten all protocol?’

‘Screw you, bitch! I invited you countless times, playing pure, but here you are with this punk! I’ll shoot him dead!’

Guanyu calmly guided the shaking gun to his forehead. ‘Go ahead. Let’s see if your bullet’s harder than my skull.’

Wan Badan trembled, trapped. Shooting meant career suicide, but backing down meant total humiliation.

Zhao Zhenwang seized the moment. ‘Director, this is madness! Put the gun away. Let’s all calm down and share a drink—my treat!’

**Chapter 2,445: Don’t Misunderstand**

Lin Qiaoqiao scoffed. ‘Enough! You’re both scum. Get out!’

Zhao Zhenwang pressed on unperturbed, eyeing Amei. ‘Just a misunderstanding! Let’s talk it over…’

‘Leave now, and you might still walk out,’ Guanyu growled, his aura chilling the room.

Zhao Zhenwang, recognizing Guanyu’s formidable presence, relented. ‘We’ll go. Director Wan, let’s not overstay.’

‘Don’t let the door hit you,’ Guanyu said icily.

At the door, Wan Badan glared back. ‘Stay away from Qiaoqiao, you bastard!’

Lin Qiaoqiao suddenly threw her arms around Guanyu and kissed his cheek. ‘Who I’m with is none of your business!’

The room gaped. As Wan Badan slammed out, roaring ‘You fucking sluts!’, Zhao Zhenwang lingered regretfully. *At least the goddess in white remains…*

Once alone, a blushing Lin Qiaoqiao stammered, ‘Th-that was just to spite him! Don’t misunderstand!’

Xue Jing arched an eyebrow. ‘Even for an act, that was… intimate. You two know each other well, don’t you?’
