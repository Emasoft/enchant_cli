“Hahaha, you three are quite clever! Never imagined you’d find us despite our deep concealment!”

As Guan Yu and Lion Camel observed their surroundings, an eerie laughter suddenly echoed from the forest.

“Show yourself if you dare! What kind of man hides like a coward?” Guan Yu barked.

The voice vanished at his challenge, yet both men remained vigilant. Experience taught them that hearing their foe was safer than this oppressive silence—the calm before a storm where ambush could strike unseen.

“Dragon Clan brother, why has the noise stopped? Did they leave?”

Guan Yu shook his head, leaning close to Amy’s ear. “I don’t know. When fighting starts, stay right here. Don’t run. If danger comes, shout for me. Understand?”

“Mm, I know. Brother Guan Yu, don’t worry. Though I’m not as strong as you or Uncle Lion Camel, I can handle small fry!”

Guan Yu patted her head gently, aware she spoke to ease his worry. “Good girl.”

**Chapter 1311: The Obstacle**

No sooner had Guan Yu finished speaking than a shadowy figure streaked past—so fast even his sharp eyes couldn’t track it.

“Amy! Elder Lion Camel! Be careful—he’s here!” Guan Yu warned, bracing himself.

“I have eyes, boy,” Lion Camel grunted. “Let me test this one first. If I falter, flee with Amy.”

Guan Yu refused. “Elder, think—your duty to the World Tree outweighs all. What use are we returning without you? The elves need you alive.”

Lion Camel’s anger faded into grim acceptance. “Very well. We gauge his strength first. No matter what, Amy stays unharmed.”

Gripping Amy’s small hand, Guan Yu whispered, “This’ll be harder than we thought. Are you afraid?”

“With you here, I’d face death without fear!”

Ahead stood a silent figure radiating lethal aura—likely a Great Swordsman.

“Stranger, have we met?” Guan Yu called.

The black-clad man waved, summoning hundreds more to encircle them. Behind him stood four others of equal power... and a hunched, repulsive figure exuding pressure surpassing them all.

“Damnation,” Guan Yu muttered. “That grotesque one—a Sword King?”

Lion Camel’s nod confirmed their peril. Guan Yu could perhaps stall five Great Swordsmen through tactics, but the Sword King matched Lion Camel. That left Amy against hundreds of Blackwater assassins—each at least a Junior Swordsman.

“How do we split this?”

Before Lion Camel could answer, Guan Yu leapt forward, landing ten meters from the five.

“Greetings!”

Mocking smirks met his hail. Undeterred, Guan Yu pressed on: “Let’s talk. What grudge demands five Great Swordsmen and a Sword King? Name it, and I’ll amend it.”

A Blackwater leader sneered. “Begging already? Recall the mercenary captain you slaughtered here months ago—our brother! We are the Blackwater Six Tigers!”

Guan Yu snorted. “Six Tigers? More like Six Swine!”

Rage erupted. “You’ll pay for those words!”

**Chapter 1312: A Duel Challenge?**

Knowing battle was inevitable, Guan Yu probed deeper. “Why mobilize your entire corps for three targets? This reeks of洛克’s scheming.”

The leanest Tiger stepped forth. “Clever pup. Yes—洛克 hired us to destabilize the elves. Once he’s puppet leader, we’ll crush their weakened tribe.”

“Traitorous worms!” Guan Yu spat. “But why aid elves you despise?”

“To exploit their civil war!” The Tiger grinned. “Now, die!”

His sword lunged—then curved unnaturally. Guan Yu dodged, summoning a violet dragon-shaped aura from his palm. Gasps arose as the magic struck, parrying the blade.

“Soaring Dragon Strike!”

The Tigers recoiled. “He’s stronger than洛克 warned!”

**Chapter 1313: Dragon Ascendant**

The violet dragon intensified, its roar shaking the battlefield. Guan Yu pressed his assault, driving the lean Tiger back.

“Enough!” The Sword King finally spoke, eyes glinting. “Crush them all.”

As the horde surged, Guan Yu’s dragon erupted skyward—a blazing omen of chaos unleashed.
