“At this hour, I believe our people have already stormed the garment factory and started smashing things up?” Xue Jing remarked.

Guan Yu nodded. “Certainly. I instructed them to demolish it thoroughly—no mercy. The more destruction, the better.”

“My, Young Brother Guan Yu truly lives by ‘an eye for an eye.’ How ruthless!” Qi Zhi chuckled, picking up his phone from the table. “Fortunately, we’re allies, not enemies.”

After fiddling with his phone, Qi Zhi added, “Brother Hou, why don’t you order more drinks? Mine’s empty, and I need to visit the restroom.” He stood, taking his phone with him. Guan Yu exchanged a meaningful glance with Hou Jinshun, signaling their plan was in motion.

Hou Jinshun nodded to a nearby server, who discreetly trailed Qi Zhi to the restroom. The lavatory was impeccably clean, devoid of odors. Qi Zhi pushed several stall doors—all occupied—before entering the farthest one, typically reserved for those needing privacy. Unperturbed by the crowd, he swiftly sent a text: *Yu Gang, 300 men target garment factory. Lai Huangsi bribed.* The recipient was an unknown number. After deleting the message, he pretended to relieve himself and exited.

Upon returning, Hou Jinshun had fetched fresh drinks. Guan Yu casually remarked, “Taking your phone to the restroom—do you snap selfies there? An unusual hobby.”

Qi Zhi laughed. “One can’t live without phones these days. Young or old, everyone’s glued to them.”

“True,” Guan Yu agreed, handing over his phone. “I just received footage of Yu Gang’s raid. Take a look.”

The video showed chaos: workers fleeing, windows splattered with ink, clamorous shouts echoing. Qi Zhi feigned indifference. “Yu Gang’s might is fearsome. Three hundred men—quite a force.”

“What do you think, Brother Qi?” Guan Yu pressed.

Before Qi Zhi could reply, another video arrived. Guan Yu’s gaze turned icy. “You must’ve been frantic to inform Billen so late. By the time his men arrive, mine will have withdrawn. Why the delay?”

The screen displayed a surveillance clip: Qi Zhi typing the incriminating text. His face paled. “You suspected me all along.”

Hou Jinshun erupted. “Traitor! I defended you, yet you betrayed us!”

“I am Billen’s agent,” Qi Zhi spat, retreating. “A ‘friendly’ approach to infiltrate and destroy you. Admirable, Guan Yu—your trap was flawless.”

Guan Yu had anticipated this. Hidden cameras in the restroom, monitored by Jing Boyan, had captured every detail.

“What’s Billen’s aim?” Guan Yu demanded.

Qi Zhi smirked. “Exposed, yet not defeated. Why did you doubt me?”

“Your ‘residence’ at Pan Taisheng’s apartment reeked of fabrication,” Guan Yu countered. “A man with no history, suddenly cozying up to Hou? Only Billen would plant such a spy.”

Qi Zhi—now revealed as Xiang Jiamian, the “Ghost Actor” among the Ten Great Villains of Jianghu—sneered. “You’ve heard of me. A title earned through… performance.”

Hou Jinshun gasped. “The Ghost Actor Xiang Jiamian! But you vanished years ago!”

Xiang’s eyes glinted malevolently. His backstory unfolded: a childhood of abuse, patricide, and mentorship under a mysterious crone. After slaughtering his martial siblings over a thwarted inheritance, he’d honed his dual personas—charming gentleman and ruthless killer.

“Billen sought my talents to dismantle you,” Xiang taunted. “But even the finest actor falters against a vigilant director.”

Guan Yu remained composed. “Your act ends tonight.”

As tension thickened, Xiang’s aura shifted—a predator cornered. The clash between justice and villainy loomed, its outcome poised to ripple through the shadowed corridors of power.
