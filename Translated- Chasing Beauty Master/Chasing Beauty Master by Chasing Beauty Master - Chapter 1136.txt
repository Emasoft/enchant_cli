“Guan Yu’s heart sank. He had completely forgotten about this matter. He should have returned directly to Qiaoyuan District earlier—that would have been the right move. At least then, Xue Jing wouldn’t have realized that Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf) wasn’t by his side. Now, explaining this would be troublesome.

“Uh, well… I was upstairs chatting with Brother Pan. Brother Jinci knew you’d be arriving soon, and since I was safe here with Brother Pan, he left first,” Guan Yu lied.

“Left? When?” Xue Jing pressed, her tone sharp.

“Just now. I assigned him a task, so I sent him away. If he’d stayed with me, I wouldn’t have needed to call you here. There’s an important mission I entrusted to him, which is why I asked you to come.” Guan Yu thought this lie sounded plausible—he could only hope it would fool Xue Jing.

**Chapter 2906: Repay Tenfold**

But Guan Yu was overthinking. Xue Jing had already seen through his lies but chose not to expose him. She knew Guan Yu hadn’t come here merely to chat with Pan Taisheng—he wouldn’t waste time on idle talk.

Noticing Guan Yu’s radiant complexion, the two long strands of woman’s hair on his clothes, and the faint but distinct medicinal fragrance clinging to him, Xue Jing’s sharp senses caught everything. Yet she played along, suspecting Guan Yu had met a lover here. Her first thought was Ling’er, who lived in this apartment.

But that didn’t add up. Even if Guan Yu and Ling’er were involved, no one in Qiaoyuan District would object. Their relationship was practically an open secret, so there’d be no need to sneak around.

Since Guan Yu wasn’t here for Ling’er, yet carried another woman’s scent, Xue Jing grew curious. “Guan Yu, where were you last night?”

The question startled him. Had she noticed something? A clever woman was trouble—especially when she was your lover.

“Me? Last night, I was drinking with Jinciyu Lang and Brother Pan here. We stayed up late, so I crashed at Brother Pan’s place,” Guan Yu bluffed.

“Really?” Xue Jing eyed him skeptically, plucking a long hair from his shoulder. “Then explain *this*.”

Guan Yu’s heart raced. Xue Jing continued, “Don’t tell me any of you three have hair this long. This strand is at least a foot long. Whose is it?”

“Uh… Brother Jinci’s? You know his hair is long,” Guan Yu stammered.

“One more lie, and I’ll strangle you,” Xue Jing snapped. “Brother Jinci’s hair is long, but not *this* long. Besides, his hair is blond. This is *black*. Explain.”

“How should I know? Wait—it must’ve come from Brother Pan’s bed! I slept there last night without undressing. The hair must’ve stuck to my clothes.” Guan Yu floundered, his lies unraveling.

Xue Jing was too sharp for half-baked excuses. If she dug deeper, he’d be cornered.

She wondered if Guan Yu had another hidden lover—someone he’d mentioned before but kept secret, promising to reveal her “when the time was right.” Regardless of the hair’s origin, her priority was Guan Yu’s safety.

“Fine. I’ll let it slide for now—along with that perfume on you,” Xue Jing said pointedly, signaling she saw through his act but wouldn’t press further.

Guan Yu exhaled in relief. “Thank you. Your understanding means everything.”

“Who else would put up with you? I know your tricks. As long as you’re safe, I won’t interfere,” Xue Jing replied, softening.

Guan Yu smiled. “Let’s head to the leather factory. Sun Xu went there today. I want to see what a man with no feet can possibly achieve.”

“Sun Xu’s at the factory? His injuries must’ve healed. But why go back?” Xue Jing asked.

“Probably scrounging for benefits. Bill Lin has discarded him as useless. My guess? He’s desperate enough to beg for a spot in my faction.”

“What? After all he’s done against us? Now he wants to join?”

“He’s got nothing left—not even a meal. Where else would he go?”

“Will you take him in?” Xue Jing knew Guan Yu wasn’t charitable. He repaid kindness tenfold—but vengeance too.

Sun Xu had once besieged Qiaoyuan District. Guan Yu would sooner dismember him than offer mercy.

As expected, Guan Yu shook his head. “Even if the world begged me, I’d refuse. Our feud runs too deep.”

“Then why meet him? Just have your men drive him away.”

“Wang Hu said Sun Xu’s searching for something at the factory—maybe a bargaining chip to trade for my mercy.”

**Chapter 2907: Low IQ**

Arriving at the leather factory, Guan Yu and Xue Jing went straight to Wang Hu’s office. Guan Yu had tasked Wang Hu with daily management, and the man greeted them promptly. “Boss! Madam!”

Xue Jing beamed at the title. “You’ve been working hard here. Is it overwhelming?”

“Not at all. Just minor tasks,” Wang Hu said, warmed by her concern.

“Let’s sit,” Guan Yu said. “Bring Sun Xu here.”

Wang Hu made a call, and soon two men wheeled in Sun Xu, whose face paled at the sight of Guan Yu. Fear radiated from him—a man who’d lost everything, now facing his nemesis.

**Chapter 2908: Major Trouble**

Guan Yu inquired about factory operations. Wang Hu reported stolen goods—over 10% of production vanished without trace.

“Theft’s normal, but this scale suggests a coordinated group,” Xue Jing analyzed.

“I’ll handle it discreetly,” Guan Yu said. “Compile a list of all department heads—their histories, everything.”

Wang Hu agreed, though daunted by the fifty-plus names.

As they strategized, Sun Xu arrived, his desperation palpable. Guan Yu’s gaze hardened—the reckoning had come.
