“A pass?” Guanyu began to reveal his true purpose, but feared Elder Jiu might disagree if he proposed it first. Thus, he decided the timing wasn’t right.

Elder Jiu remarked, “Xuanming will likely seek you within days. Your seclusion here ends now. I’ve high hopes for you, lad. Visit this old man when you can.”

“Of course,” Guanyu replied, eyes darting. “But since Master hasn’t summoned me yet, there’s no hurry. By the way, Elder Jiu, when I arrived earlier, I saw Xiaodong cleaning the farthest chamber in the wing. Is someone moving in?”

Guanyu studied Elder Jiu’s expression intently, relieved when the elder’s face remained impassive. *If he’s not angered, my plan has nine chances in ten of succeeding. Once I enter that study, I must learn something vital.*

The vast study with its sea of books promised knowledge—perhaps even clues to breaking the seal in his mind.

“That’s no guest chamber,” Elder Jiu said nostalgically. “My study. Xiaodong maintains it periodically, though I’ve not entered for years.”

“Your study?” Guanyu feigned surprise. “Shouldn’t it be frequently used? Why abandon it?”

“The tale is long,” the elder evaded, but Guanyu pressed—understanding the study’s secrets might prove crucial.

“You’ve collected hundreds of books here in the desert! Are most about immortal cultivation?”

“In youth, I devoured all knowledge,” Elder Jiu sighed. “A chance book taught breath control that awakened my spiritual energy. Thus began my cultivation journey.”

**Chapter 3610: The White-Bearded Old Man**

“How extraordinary!” Guanyu exclaimed. “Your legendary tales must be countless!”

“After attaining cultivation, I craved more,” the elder continued. “Books became my obsession—wherever I traveled, I collected them. Many remain unread in my study.”

“How did you join Cloud Azure Sect?”

Elder Jiu’s gaze grew distant. “At thirteen, I met a white-bearded sage during a storm. He gifted me a mysterious book that consumed my nights. Though illiterate villagers dismissed it, this text held cultivation secrets.”

“Through constant study, I unknowingly awakened spiritual powers. The sage had chosen me—returning five years later unchanged, as if time couldn’t touch him. He brought me to his trove of knowledge, relieving my impoverished family’s burden.”

**Chapter 3611: Bibliomania**

“His library overwhelmed me,” Elder Jiu recalled. “I carried this hunger for books to Cloud Azure Sect, rising swiftly through ranks. Yet love intervened—a senior sister’s affection clashed with my bibliomania.”

“She demanded choice between her and my books. I chose knowledge.” His voice thickened. “Decades later, realizing my folly, I sought reconciliation but found her heart hardened. To atone, I forsook both books and love, condemning myself to solitary penance.”

Guanyu marveled at the tragedy—how pride severed twin passions. “This lover... was she sect nobility?”

Elder Jiu remained silent.

“Might I visit your study?” Guanyu ventured.

“Never.” The elder’s refusal rang final. “I sealed it precisely to thwart such curiosity.”

**Chapter 3612: Barred Access**

Guanyu persisted, “What waste, hoarding such wisdom!”

He suspected deeper reasons than romance for Elder Jiu’s vigil at the Ancestral Hall. The white-bearded sage likely founded Cloud Azure Sect, setting in motion events transcending personal heartbreak. Yet the study’s secrets remained locked—as impenetrable as the elder’s regrets.
