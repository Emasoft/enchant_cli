“Since both parties have reached an agreement,” Gu Yuansheng spoke as he surveyed the room, “let us proceed directly to the auction of *Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains*. Any objections?”

The crowd voiced none. This unconventional auction promised far more intrigue than standard proceedings.

“Very well. I shall preside over this myself,” Gu Yuansheng declared.

Under the anticipatory gazes of all present, the famed landscape painting was unveiled. The three preeminent authorities examined it meticulously before nodding their approval to Gu Yuansheng.

“Let the bidding commence,” Gu Yuansheng announced, though inwardly he sighed at Guan Yu’s recklessness.

“No need for bids,” Guan Yu interjected with a sly smile. “I offer ten billion.”

**Chapter 461: Another Slap in the Face**

*Ten billion?*

The room petrified. All eyes swiveled toward Guan Yu, whose serene smile only deepened their conviction: this man was utterly, irredeemably mad.

*Ten billion?* Even Gu Yuansheng lacked such audacity.

After a stunned pause, Gu Yuansheng hurried to Guan Yu’s side and murmured, “Mr. Guan, I implore you—do not let pride cloud your judgment. The three experts here have verified the painting’s authenticity.”

His warning could not have been clearer. To persist now would brand Guan Yu a fool in everyone’s eyes.

Yet Guan Yu remained unshaken. “Mr. Gu, there’s no turning back in this wager.”

Gu Yuansheng studied him intently before giving a slight nod.

Piao Xu, initially staggered by the sum, erupted, “Are you mocking me?”

“How so?” Guan Yu replied coolly.

“A country bumpkin like you couldn’t produce ten billion! You’d struggle with ten million!” Piao Xu sneered.

“Are you so certain your painting is genuine?” Guan Yu countered. “Perhaps *you’ll* be the one paying ten billion.”

“Three experts have authenticated it!” Piao Xu jeered. “Would a brat like you dare challenge your own nation’s authorities?”

Guan Yu’s arrogance, Piao Xu thought, would be his downfall. *Ten billion? I’ll crush him beyond recovery.*

“Save your breath,” Piao Xu taunted. “Worry about producing the funds. Once the real bidding concludes, you’ll donate double to charity!”

Guan Yu rubbed his nose. The sum was indeed beyond him—he’d aimed to deliver a crippling blow to Piao Xu.

“I’ll cover Guan Yu’s ten billion.”

The voice came from Li Xi, emerging from the crowd with calm authority. Guan Yu turned, gratitude shining in his eyes as he glanced between her and Li Yuanshan nearby. Their unconditional trust moved him—this pledge could ruin Li Yuanshan’s lifelong enterprise.

“Thank you,” Guan Yu said solemnly.

Li Xi’s lips curved. “This is our joint decision. Father said we could always rebuild.”

“I won’t fail you,” Guan Yu vowed.

“We trust your judgment,” Li Xi affirmed.

“Husband,” Wen Qing added, stepping forward, “I believe in you too. Slap this hypocrite harder!”

Warmth flooded Guan Yu’s chest.

Piao Xu’s face twisted as two stunning women championed his rival. Why did every beauty align with Guan Yu? Gao Wei, Wen Qing, now this newcomer—the injustice choked him.

“You?” Piao Xu scoffed at Li Xi. “What standing do *you* have?”

“If the painting proves genuine,” Li Xi stated, “we’ll transfer ten billion to Mr. Gu within five years. Should it be fake, Mr. Piao will honor his pledge.”

Gu Yuansheng’s grave nod confirmed her credibility.

Cornered, Piao Xu spat, “Let the experts reauthenticate it! Let this fool witness his humiliation!”

**Chapter 462: Can’t You Do Math?**

Gu Yuansheng sighed. “Gentlemen, if you would?”

The three experts bristled—their hard-won reputations now questioned by an upstart. Yet they complied, scrutinizing the painting anew.

Ten minutes later, the eldest authority, Chen Yuqiang, adjusted his glasses irritably. “Our unanimous verdict stands: this is Huang Gongwang’s authentic work.”

The room erupted. Pitiful glances rained on Guan Yu and Li Xi. *Ten billion—a child’s reckless game!*

Piao Xu swelled with triumph. “Any last words?”

Guan Yu remained unperturbed. “Elder Chen, have you never erred?”

Chen stiffened. “Not for decades!”

“Yet here we are,” Guan Yu said mildly.

“Impudent pup!” Chen snapped. “Enough talk—prove your claim!”

Guan Yu approached the painting. “A masterful work—but Zhang Hong’s Ming Dynasty replica. His study of Huang’s style allowed near-perfect imitation.”

Chen paled. Zhang Hong’s reputation was well-known.

“How did you discern this?” Chen demanded, hostility fading.

Guan Yu indicated the brushwork. “Zhang combined texture strokes with washes, unlike Huang’s pale ochre technique. Compare the hills and pavilions.”

As Chen leaned closer, Guan Yu added, “The forger split the canvas layers. Magnify any edge—the blurred lines betray alteration.”

The experts huddled, exclamations growing louder. Finally, Chen breathed, “It *is* Zhang Hong’s copy! Young man, your eye is extraordinary!”

Guan Yu turned to Piao Xu, whose face resembled curdled milk.

**Chapter 463: Piao Xu’s Fury**

“No wall is impervious to wind,” Guan Yu drawled. “Clever schemes still unravel.”

Piao Xu struggled for composure. “This is slander! International experts authenticated—”

“Shall we compare it to my Zhang Hong collection?” Chen challenged.

Piao Xu’s mask cracked. “Your nation disgusts me! I came in goodwill, yet face baseless accusations. Korea would never tolerate this!”

“You’re pitiable,” Guan Yu said softly.

“What did you say?!”

“Struggle all you like—the lower canvas layer remains. Your accomplice hid the top layer here. Shall we search his room?”

All eyes turned to Piao Xu’s associate, who collapsed weeping. “Forgive me, Director Piao! I succumbed to greed!”

The room exploded.

“Sanxie Corporation’s reputation is ruined!”

“Cancel all Sanxie projects!”

Piao Xu kicked the man savagely. “Forgiveness? Who will forgive *me*?!”

Ten billion lost. Sanxie’s Chinese market collapsing. The repercussions terrified him.

Guan Yu watched coldly. “Enough theatrics. On behalf of China’s people, I thank you for your... generosity.”

Piao Xu trembled, fury and despair warring within.

Gu Yuansheng stepped forward. “Sanxie’s future collaborations hang in the balance.”

Piao Xu blanched. Losing China’s market—half their profits—meant corporate ruin.

“I... must consult my father,” he croaked. “Sanxie’s honor—”

Snorts of derision answered him.

As Piao Xu turned to leave, Guan Yu called, “Wait!”

“What now?!” Piao Xu snarled.

“Can’t you count? It’s 10.1 billion. Did you think the ring was free?”

Laughter filled the hall.

**Epilogue**

Piao Xu stormed out, murder in his eyes.

Wen Qing embraced Guan Yu. “You’re brilliant!”

“The ring...” he began.

“It’s better spent helping children,” she smiled.

Gu Yuansheng approached, admiration glowing. “Young hero! Your expertise astonishes.”

Li Yuanshan grinned. “He’s equally unmatched in jade appraisal. My finest ruby jade? His find.”

Guan Yu flushed, scratching his head as the crowd buzzed with his legend.
