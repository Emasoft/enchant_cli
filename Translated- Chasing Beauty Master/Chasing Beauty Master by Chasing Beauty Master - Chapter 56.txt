“Ah? If it’s on the bed, that’s fine!” Luo Cheng was taken aback and hurried forward, whispering. Due to full-body edema, the swelling on her legs had thickened considerably. For daily necessities, Mother Luo had been confined to bed for half a year, relying on bedpans and specialized hospital toilets.

“No, it’s alright. Mama wants to use the bathroom. I feel strong all over now—quick, help me up to walk!” Having lain bedridden for over half a year without her feet touching the ground, Mother Luo’s sudden burst of vigor made her eager to move.

Ah? The nearby patients who had been watching with idle curiosity froze in astonishment. She... intended to get out of bed? Walk on her own?

Every jaw dropped as if catching flies, except for Guan Yu, who sat calmly with pursed lips, watching Mother Luo and the crowd with quiet composure. All this unfolded exactly as he had anticipated.

**Chapter 134: Good People Live in Peace**

As Mother Luo took tentative steps out of the ward with support, the other patients turned bewildered gazes toward Guan Yu.

“Hmm...” An elderly man by the door coughed, observing Luo Cheng and the children trailing after Mother Luo. Glancing at Guan Yu, he sighed and shook his head. “A final rally before the end. That old Luo woman... her lamp’s oil is nearly spent.”

What? Guan Yu stared dumbfounded at the old man. *Final rally? Dying embers? Is he out of his mind?*

That fleeting clarity and vigor before death—seemingly a recovery—was but a last flicker, a brief farewell signal. Medically, this “terminal lucidity” stemmed from adrenal hormones aiding patients through crises, yet it was merely the body’s final struggle before extinction.

But Mother Luo’s condition was *nothing* like that! The old man’s words sent a chill through Guan Yu, as though prophesying doom.

Watching the wardmates whisper and gossip, Guan Yu smirked in amusement, rose, and walked out.

“Smart lad, fleeing after killing someone. Really...”

“Don’t say that. That Luo woman was already on death’s door! Her children scraped pennies but couldn’t afford treatment. This was just her time—no fault of that boy.”

“Didn’t he promise to cover her bills? Now he’s bolted! Ha...” The patients chattered without concern, their indifference to Mother Luo’s plight sparking disgust in Guan Yu.

Humans sometimes fell below animals. Where creatures mourned their kin, humans met tragedy with apathy...

Leaning against the corridor wall outside, Guan Yu lit a cigarette, awaiting Mother Luo’s return.

In the bathroom, Mother Luo stared in shock at the blackish-yellow mucus swirling in the toilet—foul-smelling toxins expelled from her body. Though ordinary and medically uneducated, she understood: *This... is purification.*

Modern science could only temporarily revive kidney function through dialysis, never truly purging deep-seated toxins. Yet after Guan Yu’s treatment, this miraculous expulsion left her trembling with hope.

Clutching the wall, she emerged trembling—not from weakness, but overwhelming gratitude.

“Luo Cheng! Quick—take me to Guan Yu! I must thank him properly! This illness... it can be *cured*! No surgery, no transplant!” Her voice quivered with emotion.

Guan Yu, leaning against a wall exhaling smoke, met their approaching group.

“Child, thank you! Your... your *qigong* truly works!”

“I know, I know,” Guan Yu waved humbly.

“Mother Luo, save your thanks. I admire you—your years of kindness, your compassion. Good people deserve peace. This is my duty.”

“Oh, stop. I’m just soft-hearted—can’t bear seeing abandoned children... even stray puppies...” She trailed off, swatting Luo Cheng’s head in embarrassed affection.

Luo Cheng grinned foolishly, nodding fervently at Guan Yu.

“Besides, Luo Cheng and I are brothers. No need for formalities. I’ll cure you—count on it. Now rest; I’ll return tomorrow after classes.”

“You’re a *student*?”

“Guan Yu’s in university!” Luo Cheng interjected proudly.

Nodding warmly, Mother Luo urged, “Go, focus on your studies. My illness has lasted years—a day won’t matter.”

After farewells, Luo Cheng escorted Guan Yu out. At a deserted corridor corner, Luo Cheng suddenly knelt, gripping Guan Yu’s hands.

“Brother Guan, I’ll repay this debt even as your ox or horse! She’s our only family—without her...”

“Rise!” Guan Yu hauled him up, faced with solemn gratitude from the group.

“We grew up without kin. She’s our harbor. Losing her... unthinkable. We’ll repay this lifelong favor!”

Embarrassed, Guan Yu shrugged. “Fate brought us together. I’ll heal her—trust me.”

As Luo Cheng biked him back to campus, Guan Yu realized his predicament: he hadn’t attended a single class since enrollment.

Resigned, he called Liu Shilei. Minutes later, she emerged, waving.

“Where’ve you been?” she demanded.

“Earning money,” he grinned.

Sighing, she lectured, “Focus on studies! Even basics could land you film crew work later. Why rush into jobs now? Broke?”

He chuckled at her scolding—oddly warmed by her concern.

After she escorted him to class, whispers erupted.

“Missed two lectures? The new monitor’s a joke—you’d want to chair him!” dormmate Wang Zhen hissed.

Guan Yu shrugged. Degrees meant nothing to him—he sought true love here. *Liu Shilei? Du Xiaojuan? Feng Xin?* His romantic prospects tangled confusingly.

**Chapter 135: True Love**

At lunch, Fu Linlin approached silently, sitting beside him.

“Eating?” Guan Yu nodded.

Wang Zhen leered until Guan Yu cut him off. After meals, Fu Linlin followed Guan Yu out.

“Wait!” she called, chasing him to the wash area.

“Need something?”

She met his gaze. “Talk.”

**Chapter 136: The Blade Above Lust**

As they walked, dormmate Tian Hao quipped, “Ancient sorrows spring from love—lust’s blade hangs overhead!”

Wang Zhen snorted. “Since when philosopher?”

In the bustling cafeteria, Guan Yu finally grasped campus reality—crowds everywhere.

Mid-meal, Fu Linlin reappeared, seating herself wordlessly beside him.

“Know her?” Wang Zhen probed.

“Eat,” Guan Yu deadpanned.

After finishing, Guan Yu rose to leave.

“Wait!” Fu Linlin abandoned her meal, following.

Wang Zhen smirked. “Our Guan’s quite the charmer.”

Tian Hao intoned, “Regret follows passion—lust’s blade...”

“What drivel?” Wang Zhen rolled eyes.

At the sink, Guan Yu turned. “Well?”

Fu Linlin met his gaze, tray in hand. The unspoken tension thickened—a storm brewing beneath campus routine.
