“After all, Magistrate Pang had already handed over the silver earlier. He believed the other party would give him some leeway. For now, Young Master Li’s fate was beyond his concern.

‘Magistrate Pang, stop your busywork. Captain Yu is summoning you.’ Wang Jun found him in the rear courtyard.

Magistrate Pang chuckled, ‘Brother, I still have matters to settle here. I’ll go immediately afterward. Inform Captain Yu that I’ll reward him handsomely later.’

Having already bribed Wang Jun, he was confident of the man’s cooperation. Wang Jun smiled, ‘Magistrate Pang, cease your efforts. Rest assured—most charges have already been pinned on Young Master Li. To escape unscathed, someone must take the fall. He’s the perfect candidate.’

Magistrate Pang brightened. His own safety mattered most; Young Master Li’s fate concerned him not.

Yet unease lingered. Young Master Li was cunning. If he dragged Magistrate Pang into the scheme during interrogation, complications would arise.

Wang Jun’s words were pure deception. This matter extended far beyond a few slaves. Guanyu’s true aim was to aid Liu Yun—to ensure her husband and eldest daughter’s deaths were not in vain.

Had Guanyu not encountered Liu Yun, he might have ignored the yamen’s corrupt affairs. Scum like them would eventually face retribution.

But fate had intervened. Liu Yun’s husband had died unjustly; her daughter’s life had been cruelly cut short. Guanyu resolved to expose Magistrate Pang and Young Master Li’s crimes, delivering karmic justice so the deceased could rest peacefully and Liu Yun might find solace.

‘Brother, tell me truthfully—what’s Captain Yu’s stance? Can he handle Young Master Li? That man comes from immense wealth. If he shifts all blame onto me, what then?’ Magistrate Pang fretted, knowing Young Master Li wouldn’t surrender meekly.

Wang Jun advised, ‘Discussions are ongoing. Remember—deny all accusations. Pin everything on Young Master Li. That’s your only path. Hiding evidence now is futile. Everyone knows your dealings.

If you trust me, come immediately. Don’t let Young Master Li’s lies condemn you alone. Wasn’t the slave trade his idea? He coaxed you into it for a cut of profits. Now he abandons you to clean his mess. Why shield him?’

Magistrate Pang saw the logic. Indeed, Young Master Li had initiated everything. The magistrate had merely taken bribes, yet now bore full blame while scrambling to hide evidence.

‘You’re right. I’ll go with you. At this point, I care not. I barely know that Young Master Li!’ His demeanor shifted instantly to cold estrangement.

Wang Jun’s elaborate ruse succeeded—luring Magistrate Pang willingly proved far simpler than force.

Upon arrival, Magistrate Pang glared venomously at Young Master Li. Wang Jun knew the vipers would soon turn on each other.

‘Young Master Li! What unspeakable acts have you committed here to draw Captain Yu’s attention? Confess truthfully, or I’ll show no mercy!’ Magistrate Pang thundered with feigned righteousness.

Young Master Li glanced up coolly, ‘Explain yourself. What nonsense is this?’

‘Cease your games! We’re hardly acquainted. Know your place!’ Magistrate Pang declared pompously.

Guanyu nearly gagged at the sudden betrayal. Such rapid shifts of loyalty! Yet he remained calm—Magistrate Pang wouldn’t escape, and Young Master Li’s docile facade hid cunning.

This mutual hostility might provoke full disclosure, sparing further effort.

‘Unacquainted?’ Young Master Li sneered, ‘Choose words carefully, Magistrate. Or will you disown yourself next?’

Ignoring him, Magistrate Pang addressed Captain Yu, ‘This man posed as a merchant lodging here. I know nothing of his activities. Investigate thoroughly and clear my name!’

‘Oh? Is that so?’ Captain Yu feigned curiosity, obligated by earlier bribes to play along. ‘Then I’ll take him for interrogation. Torture loosens tongues.’

Guanyu inwardly cheered. As the snakes turned, truth would emerge naturally. Now to free the captives.

Chapter 3911: Unlocking the Door

‘I know of an underground cell in the yamen’s rear courtyard holding slaves for sale,’ Guanyu declared. ‘Captain Yu, let’s rescue them. Their testimony will reveal all.’

Captain Yu nodded reluctantly. ‘Very well. My men accompany you. Others guard these two.’

At the courtyard, Guanyu pointed to a lumber pile. ‘Last night, I witnessed Young Master Li and Magistrate Pang enter here. The prisoners are below.’

Finding a hidden switch, Guanyu revealed a stone slab. Lifting it exposed a passageway.

Captain Yu marveled, ‘Discovering this lair required remarkable effort.’

‘Let’s focus on rescues,’ Guanyu urged, descending first.

In the deepest chamber, six cowering women shrank from their approach. ‘Fear not. Captain Yu and I are here to free you,’ Guanyu reassured.

The traumatized women remained distrustful. Captain Yu swelled with self-importance at his ‘heroic’ role.

‘Try prying this lock,’ Guanyu indicated the cell gate.

Captain Yu drew his blade, frightening the women into screams. ‘We mean no harm!’ Guanyu explained. ‘Your captors are arrested. Expose their crimes!’

The lock yielded easily. ‘Come, you’re free,’ Guanyu urged, but the women hesitated.

‘We’re Prefectural Lord Zhou’s men,’ Captain Yu boasted. ‘Our uniforms prove it!’

‘Indeed,’ Guanyu added. ‘Would villains bother persuading? Look at Captain Yu’s honorable bearing!’

Gradually, the women emerged, squinting painfully at daylight. ‘Rest here briefly,’ Guanyu advised. ‘Your eyes need adjustment.’

To Captain Yu: ‘Escort everyone to the main hall. Their testimony will decide this.’

‘Agreed. Let’s expose these scoundrels publicly,’ Captain Yu declared, departing with prisoners.

Guanyu stayed, addressing the women: ‘Stay as witnesses if willing. Seek justice—or leave freely. The choice is yours.’

None departed. Their smoldering hatred demanded retribution.

Chapter 3912: Interrogation

In the main hall, Magistrate Pang despaired as captives appeared. His doom was sealed.

Young Master Li glared defiantly at Guanyu and Captain Yu. ‘Destroy my livelihood? You’ll pay,’ he seethed silently, nursing his broken arm.

Wealth assured his confidence—bribes could fix anything. Yet Captain Yu’s presence gave pause. Offending Prefectural Lord Zhou’s envoy courted disaster.

The entire yamen staff assembled under guard. Even kitchen hands gaped at their disgraced superior.

Magistrate Pang’s secretly kept concubines—now exposed in disheveled attire—further damned him. Official misconduct charges alone sufficed for punishment.

‘Silence!’ Captain Yu barked. The murmuring crowd stilled.

Gesturing at the captive women, he demanded, ‘Explain this, Magistrate! Full confession may earn leniency.’

‘A misunderstanding!’ Magistrate Pang blustered. ‘These refugees mean nothing to me!’

Among the captives, Xiao Meihua recognized Magistrate Pang—her former tormentor in the cell. Confusion reigned—how had her ‘customer’ become a magistrate?

‘Misunderstanding?’ Captain Yu scoffed. ‘Your yamen’s secret prison holds these women, yet you plead ignorance? Does your staff corroborate this?’

The yamen servants crowding the doorway shook their heads—none had seen these prisoners.

Magistrate Pang’s oily smile strained, ‘Ask anyone here! They’ll confirm my innocence!’

The stage was set. Truth would soon unravel through the vipers’ mutual betrayal.”
