**Chapter 2072: Beyond Provocation**

Feng Xihu’s rage remained unquenched as she ordered her underlings to continue beating the young man. At that moment, Hou Jinshun emerged from the Huaye Club and witnessed the scene. He roared, “Stop right there! Do you know where you are? How dare you cause trouble here?”

When Feng Xihu turned and saw Hou Jinshun, her hatred flared even brighter. The thought of this man conspiring with Guan Yu to deceive her sent her into a frenzy. Pointing at his face, she shrieked, “You spineless worm! How dare you collude with Guan Yu to trick me? Attack him!” With that, she commanded her men to charge at Hou Jinshun.

But who was Hou Jinshun? A seasoned martial artist. With ruthless efficiency, he incapacitated the lackeys. Though angered by their assault on his staff, he held back—aware of Feng Xihu’s possible ties to Guan Yu—and avoided lethal strikes.

“All of you bully me! I’ll fight you to the death!” Feng Xihu lunged at Hou Jinshun, aiming a kick. Though unfazed, Hou Jinshun refused to strike a woman, especially one connected to Guan Yu. He dodged her blows with ease.

Feng Xihu swung wildly for what felt like an age without even grazing his sleeve, her fury mounting with each missed strike.

Most women would have dissolved into tears by now, but Feng Xihu’s temper only burned hotter with frustration.

**Chapter 2073: A Hundred Thousand**

Hou Jinshun massaged his temples, silently cursing Guan Yu for dumping such a volatile situation into his lap. He hadn’t anticipated the woman’s temper being this fiery.

He retreated step by step, dodging until Feng Xihu chased him into the Huaye Club’s main hall.

An hour later, exhausted and panting, Feng Xihu collapsed onto a chair. “Tell me where Guan Yu is,” she demanded, “or I’ll camp here until you do!”

Hou Jinshun grimaced. He’d never encountered such a fiery woman. Thinking quickly, he replied, “I truly don’t know his whereabouts. But he’ll return for his car eventually. Stake out his vehicle, and you’ll catch him.”

Feng Xihu grudgingly admitted the logic. Raging blindly wouldn’t solve anything.

Returning home, she vented her fury by overturning tables and smashing vases, treating the furnishings as punching bags. As always, her tantrums targeted the East Wing—the domain of the Feng family’s patriarch and young master.

By dawn, the entire household—servants and Feng Shaoye (Feng Young Master) alike—had been jolted awake by her rampage.

Rubbing sleep from his eyes, Feng Shaoye initially feared a burglary, only to find history repeating. Mentally reviewing recent days, he confirmed he hadn’t provoked his sister’s wrath.

Approaching cautiously, he asked, “Little sister, what’s wrong? Nightmares?”

“Feng Shaoye,” she snapped, “I need you to do something for me.”

“Of course. Name it, and I’ll handle it flawlessly,” he replied, too wary of her explosive mood to protest.

Feng Xihu, having failed to corner Guan Yu, redirected her rage toward the Huaye Club. A recluse ignorant of its formidable backers, she ordered, “Send men to smash that wretched club to pieces!”

“What?!” Feng Shaoye blanched. “Why target Huaye?”

When he hesitated, Feng Xihu hurled a chair at a priceless oil painting. The crash of splintering wood and glass punctuated her scream: “What? You refuse to help me trash a pathetic club?!”

Wincing at the ruined artwork, Feng Shaoye pleaded, “It’s not that—but Huaye is untouchable!”

“Untouchable?!” she scoffed. “Nothing in this city is beyond the Feng family’s reach!”

In her sheltered worldview, the Fengs reigned supreme—even the mayor had recently paid homage.

Swallowing dread, Feng Shaoye vowed, “I’ll avenge you. Leave it to me.” Explaining the club’s ties to the Yang family would be futile. Better to stage a minor disturbance than face her renewed wrath.

Relieved, Feng Xihu stormed off. Only when her footsteps faded did Feng Shaoye exhale.

Summoning a battered underling later, he grilled the man about the previous night’s events. Learning of Guan Yu’s escape and Hou Jinshun’s intervention, he cursed, “Guan Yu again! Wherever he’s involved, disaster follows!”

Huaye Club belonged to Yang Conghan of the Yang dynasty—a force even the Fengs dared not cross. Yet, to placate his sister, Feng Shaoye ordered a covert vandalism: “Damage a few tables discreetly. Pay compensation quietly. Under no circumstances reveal our involvement!”

---

That evening, as Guan Yu returned Hou Jinshun’s car keys at Huaye, five thugs entered—disguised but recognizable as Feng lackeys. Guan Yu lingered, curious.

The men swaggered in, demanding a shoe shine before overturning tables. Hou Jinshun, maintaining composure, requested they leave. When they refused, he struck—floors them swiftly.

“Compensation: a hundred thousand,” he declared.

The thugs gaped. Their master had provided only fifty thousand. Before they could protest, Hou Jinshun and staff descended, leaving them bloodied.

**Chapter 2074: The Matchmaking Gambit**

That night, Feng Shaoye stared at his mangled men, feigning outrage. “Compensation? Consider it done!” he announced loudly for Feng Xihu’s benefit.

Turning to her, he ventured, “I’ve honored my promise. Now, grant me one favor.”

“If it doesn’t involve Guan Yu,” she muttered, appetite lost at the sight of gore.

His request—to distance herself from Guan Yu—died unspoken as she stormed out.

Fuming, Feng Shaoye swept dishes from the table. To curb her obsession, he devised a plan: inundate her with suitors.

Days later, Feng Xihu faced an endless parade of “eligible” bachelors—nobles, heirs, and commoners alike—all vying for her hand. Feng Shaoye masked his scheme as familial duty, amassing gifts and alliances while hoping one would divert her fixation.

Yet Feng Xihu played along mechanically, her thoughts still tethered to Guan Yu. As the charade escalated, Feng Shaoye’s desperation grew—a ticking clock before her patience shattered.
