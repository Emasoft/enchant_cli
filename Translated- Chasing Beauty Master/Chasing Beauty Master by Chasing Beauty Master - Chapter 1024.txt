“Though there’s no benefit in meddling, he’d encountered many incidents here—even dead bodies weren’t uncommon—but never anything like what happened today.”

“Sir! Sir, spare me! Please calm down—I’ll leave right now! Don’t act rashly!” The pudgy policeman knelt on the ground, face pale and drenched in sweat, trembling as he pleaded. His fearful gaze locked onto Guan Yu’s eyes, utterly convinced the man would pull the trigger. His soul nearly fled his body in terror.

Guan Yu’s domineering aura was overwhelming, his gun pressed to the officer’s head. Just as he opened his mouth to curse again, Xue Jing called from behind, “Guan Yu, ignore them! Shuangshuang needs you!”

“Scram if you want to live!” Guan Yu snarled before rushing back to crouch beside Shuangshuang. Softening his voice, he said, “Don’t worry, little one. Big Brother will chase all these troublemakers away soon.”

Shuangshuang weakly reached out, and Guan Yu quickly clasped her small hand. “Big Brother… don’t be angry. You’re scaring me when you look like that.”

“Alright, Big Brother won’t get angry anymore. I’ll listen to you.”

“That’s my Big Brother! You’re so good when you smile—it’s your handsomest look.”

The three remaining officers, witnessing Guan Yu’s ferocity, dared not approach further, only watching warily from a distance. Meanwhile, the fat policeman—helped up by colleagues—glared daggers at Guan Yu’s back. “Damn show-off. Wait till backup arrives. We’ll drag you in and see how smug you are then.”

Sirens wailed in the distance as an ambulance soon arrived. Two men and a woman emerged, urgently bandaging Shuangshuang’s wound and transfusing fresh blood.

Amidst the crowd, Guan Yu spotted a familiar figure—Second Only to Wolf, summoned precisely because further danger couldn’t be risked. Xue Jing had exhausted most of her internal energy stabilizing Shuangshuang’s injury, leaving them vulnerable to any new threats. Reluctantly, Guan Yu had called his ally for covert protection.

When Guan Yu and Xue Jing prepared to accompany Shuangshuang to the hospital, the fat officer moved to block them, but a colleague restrained him. “Want a bullet? He’s armed—we can’t handle him. Let them go. We’ll tail them until reinforcements come.”

Seeing reason, the fat officer followed in his car after the speeding ambulance. Inside, Guan Yu watched Shuangshuang’s condition stabilize as she fell into deep sleep.

**Chapter 2618: Saving Two Lives**

Observing Shuangshuang’s furrowed brows even in slumber—likely from pain—Guan Yu turned to Xue Jing. “You’ve worked hard today,” he murmured.

Xue Jing smiled faintly. “If Shuangshuang hadn’t taken that knife for me, I’d be the one lying here. Thank her, not me.”

“True. Who’d have thought she’d shield you like that? Thank the heavens you stabilized her in time. If she’d…” Guan Yu trailed off, the unspoken consequence hanging heavy.

“Today was too close. We can’t afford such carelessness again. Call Conghan—she’ll help handle this. The situation’s too severe.” Xue Jing’s brow remained tense.

Nodding, Guan Yu dialed Yang Conghan. “Conghan, there’s trouble. Two deaths…”

“Where are you?!” Yang Conghan demanded upon hearing of the fatalities.

“In an ambulance—a friend took a knife for Xue Jing. Heading to the hospital now.”

Yang Conghan paused, recognizing the gravity. “Don’t go to the hospital. Bring them to my family’s private clinic. I’ll meet you there.”

The Yangs’ clinic, though termed modestly, rivaled full hospitals in scale and equipment, staffed by internationally recruited doctors. After redirecting the ambulance, Guan Yu noted the nurses’ surprised glances at the destination—the Yang establishment’s reputation preceded it.

The hour-long rush through the sprawling city ended at the clinic. As staff took over, Yang Conghan instructed the surgeons before approaching Guan Yu. Seeing his bloodied hands, she gasped, “Are you hurt?!”

“Not mine,” he reassured. After washing up, he recounted the ambush: a staged couple’s quarrel masking assassins, Shuangshuang’s sacrificial intervention, and the lethal aftermath.

Yang Conghan paled. “Without Xue Jing’s reflexes… You’ve changed, Guan Yu. Become reckless.”

Xue Jing interjected, “Shuangshuang’s observation tipped me off. She noticed the ‘angry boyfriend’ sweating nervously—a sign he was nearing his target.”

Guan Yu’s eyes widened. “So Shuangshuang saved us both tonight.”

“Exactly. Had she…” Xue Jing shuddered, still haunted by her lethal reaction.

“The planners were cunning,” Guan Yu mused. “Using ordinary students as killers—no aura to suspect. Likely Feng Family’s work, or Billen’s machinations. Others lack such reach.”

**Chapter 2619: Beyond Capability**

Yang Conghan assured them, “Self-defense against assassins may warrant commendation, not charges. Rest easy.”

Relieved, Xue Jing and Guan Yu settled in for the night. They couldn’t abandon Shuangshuang, resolving to inform her mother after surgery.

“Once stable, move her to her mother’s hospital room,” Guan Yu decided. “They’ll recover together. As for school, hire tutors—cost is no issue.”

Suspecting the Fengs, Guan Yu mulled their motives until surgeons emerged hours later. “No organ damage,” one reported. “But the lumbar scar will remain unless treated later.”

In Shuangshuang’s private suite—a perk of Yang connections—Xue Jing sighed. “We owe her everything today.”

After updating Meimei to prevent panic, Guan Yu bid Yang Conghan farewell, only to find police outside. The fat officer, now backed by squad cars, raged at guards denying entry. “That bastard threatened me! You’re harboring a criminal!”

A guard retorted coldly, “Where’s your proof? This isn’t your precinct to shout in. Leave before you regret it.”

Unaware of the Yangs’ influence, the officer blustered on—a stark contrast to his wary colleagues. Yang Conghan observed disdainfully before departing, the unresolved tension lingering like smoke.
