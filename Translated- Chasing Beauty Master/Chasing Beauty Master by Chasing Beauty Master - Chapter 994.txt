“I remember the first time I came to knock on the door, a man inside coughed. Since someone was there, I decided to clean the women’s restroom first. After finishing, when I went to clean the men’s restroom again, I knocked and found it still occupied with the door locked. I thought I’d wait a bit longer and went to clean around the bar area instead…”

“Wait a moment,” Xue Jing interrupted. “When you cleaned the bar, did you see Xiao Qi there?”

Since Xiao Qi and another girl were the bar cashiers, they usually stayed at their posts. The cleaning auntie recalled, “No, only Xiao Xiao was there.”

Xiao Xiao was the other waitress. Xue Jing asked her, “Did you stay at the bar the whole time? How long has it been since you last saw Xiao Qi?”

Xiao Xiao shook her head, pondering. “Not exactly. With few customers today, I wandered around chatting. Xiao Qi seemed upset when she arrived, playing with her phone like something was bothering her. I didn’t notice when she went to the restroom.”

“Auntie, please continue,” Xue Jing urged.

The auntie said, “After casually cleaning the bar, I decided to try the men’s restroom again before my shift ended. I knocked habitually—no answer—so I assumed it was empty. The door opened easily this time. Inside the farthest stall… I found Xiao Qi dead on the toilet. I panicked and started screaming.”

Guan Yu found nothing suspicious in her account. The restroom was spacious: a two-meter central aisle flanked by ten stalls—five on each side. Xiao Qi’s body lay in the leftmost stall. Exiting, Guan Yu noted no surveillance cameras. The restroom exit led to the hall, facing the bar’s cashier counter. Only the bar had a camera; none covered the restroom exit—understandably so.

Returning inside, Guan Yu asked Xiao Xiao, “You were at the bar when the auntie cleaned it, correct?”

Xiao Xiao nodded. “Yes, I chatted with her. I said the place was already clean with few customers, but she insisted on tidying up before shift change.”

Having cleared the auntie and Xiao Xiao, Guan Yu focused on the three male staff and Hou Jinshun as suspects. Nine people now crowded the restroom: three male servers, Xiao Xiao, the auntie, Hou Jinshun, Guan Yu, Xue Jing, and Ling’er. With Hou Jinshun unlikely to commit murder here, suspicion fell on the three men.

Without surveillance footage, interrogation was necessary. Guan Yu asked, “Could you introduce these three?”

Hou Jinshun obliged: “The tallest is Cui Li—worked here four months, handles guest service and orders.” Cui Li stood over 1.8 meters, lanky with ordinary features and dyed blond hair—typical youthful styling in such venues.

“The shortest is Deng Chaowen—here under two months, same duties.” Deng Chaowen was handsome despite his height, sporting two ear piercings and shoulder-length hair reminiscent of gangster-film idols—a look appealing to young women. Known for flirtatiousness, he’d recently learned mixology.

“The burly one is Feng Guangjun—a long-term employee since my arrival. Reliable and quiet.” Feng Guangjun appeared honest and reserved, well-liked among staff with no vices.

“The killer is among you three,” Xue Jing stated coldly. “Confess now for leniency, or face the police.”

The men exchanged glances but remained silent. Hou Jinshun urged, “Admit it if guilty. They’ll uncover the truth within half an hour.”

Ling’er, still nauseous from witnessing the corpse, forced herself to stay. With no confession, Guan Yu began interrogations.

Cui Li claimed, “I’ve been in the hall all day, on my phone when idle.” Deng Chaowen shrugged, “Mixing drinks—exact timing unclear.” Feng Guangjun said, “Fetching a steak from the kitchen around an hour ago.” Kitchen staff confirmed the order but couldn’t verify timing.

Xue Jing determined Xiao Qi died within the hour, her neck broken by blunt force. Separately questioning Xiao Xiao revealed, “Xiao Qi and Feng Guangjun were secretly dating. She’d been troubled lately but never mentioned why.”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu deduced: “The killer lured Xiao Qi here, locked the main door, and assaulted her. When she resisted, he silenced her by crushing her neck with a phone. Her missing phone was likely disposed of. The locked main door—normally never locked—is key. After the auntie’s first attempt, the killer remained inside undetected.”

Xue Jing reenacted events: having everyone exit, she had the auntie knock. The door unexpectedly opened—mimicking the earlier scenario. Guan Yu, who’d hidden inside during the demonstration, revealed himself. “The killer never left—he stayed hidden until the auntie returned. Feng Guangjun, your ‘kitchen errand’ was a lie. The steak order came after Xiao Qi’s death. You’re the only one unaccounted for during the critical window.”

Cornered, Feng Guangjun confessed: their secret relationship had soured. When Xiao Qi threatened exposure, he silenced her in panic. The locked door bought time to hide until the auntie’s return, blending into the crowd afterward.
