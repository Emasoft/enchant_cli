Perhaps due to an unbelievable reason, Liu Bingrong instinctively rubbed his eyes, confirming that the cold-faced young man before him bore an uncanny resemblance to the son-in-law he’d met yesterday.

He could only say they looked eerily alike, yet deep down refused to believe this person was truly Guan Yu.

“What’s the matter, Uncle? We met just yesterday—have you forgotten me so quickly?” A faint sneer curled at Guan Yu’s lips.

Liu Bingrong’s jaw dropped further. “Guan Yu? How… how is it you?”

“Why wouldn’t it be? I’m the ‘boss’ you were just speaking of.” Guan Yu mocked.

Liu Bingrong’s lips twitched, but no words emerged.

Zhao Hu knew it was time to solidify Guan Yu’s image in his father-in-law’s eyes.

He stepped forward and said, “Liu Bingrong, I envy you for gaining such a son-in-law. Young and accomplished—not only the underground king of N City but also of L City, the provincial capital of J Province. Such power commands respect. I dare say no one in J Province rivals Brother Guan.”

Guan Yu cast Zhao Hu a sidelong glance, understanding his intent, and remained silent.

Liu Bingrong stood dumbfounded, stunned by Zhao Hu’s words and the man himself.

As a local of M City, few didn’t know Zhao Hu—the infamous underworld boss. Yet here he stood, deferring to Guan Yu with palpable fear.

Liu Bingrong now believed Guan Yu ruled two cities’ underworld. A man of such power—wealthy, influential, the perfect son-in-law.

Realizing this, Liu Bingrong’s demeanor shifted. He approached Guan Yu, ingratiating. “Guan Yu, why hide your status? I’d gladly entrust Shilei to you. Let’s share a drink!”

Guan Yu coldly ignored his sudden warmth. “Have you repaid the 600,000 debt?”

Liu Bingrong stiffened. “I… I can’t pay now. Could you… lend it? I’ll have Shilei repay you.”

“Tiger,” Guan Yu turned to Zhao Hu, “handle this by your rules. I won’t interfere.”

Zhao Hu hesitated. “Cut his organs?”

“Drown him.”

As Zhao Hu’s men dragged Liu Bingrong out, he screamed, “Guan Yu! I’m your father-in-law! Shilei will grieve!”

“You think you deserve that title?” Guan Yu sneered.

Liu Bing荣 panicked, confessing to stealing jewelry meant for Shilei.

After a night of terror—dipped twice into the icy river—Liu Bingrong emerged a broken man.

The next day, when Shilei called frantically, Guan宇 soothed her with white lies about her father’s “gambling trip.”

By the time the family reunited for dinner, Liu Bingrong sat meekly, reformed.

As they toasted, Liu Bingrong stood, trembling, to accept Guan Yu’s drink—a chastened man.
