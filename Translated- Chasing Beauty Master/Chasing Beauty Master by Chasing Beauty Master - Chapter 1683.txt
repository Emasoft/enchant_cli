As for Xuanming, he was undoubtedly the most formidable. As the sect leader, he had access to far more powerful cultivation techniques—secrets only inheritors of the leadership could independently master, utterly beyond the reach of others.

Azhe’s spell gradually took shape. During its casting, everyone distinctly felt the surrounding air grow colder as howling gales erupted. At the center of the arena, a vast magnetic field swirled into existence, spinning with the ferocious speed of a tornado.

The winds sucked in every loose object nearby, including weapons that had previously been knocked to the ground.

Astonishment etched every onlooker’s face. Some, gripped by fear, stumbled backward to avoid the spell’s potential wrath.

Zhao Xue stood closest. Her crimson dress flapped wildly in the tempest, yet her face betrayed no fear—only exhilaration and delight.

Once the spell was fully unleashed, Azhe appeared slightly drained. The technique had consumed over half the spiritual energy stored in his brush. Given his current abilities, wielding such magic strained him considerably.

As the spell ended, the fierce winds abruptly ceased. Debris from the arena clattered to the ground—wood splintered into fragments, while iron weapons like swords and scimitars lay twisted and warped, mangled by the wind’s thunderous clashes.

One could easily imagine: had anyone been caught within that vortex, they would now be little more than a corpse.

“That’s amazing.” Zhao Xue breathed the words, gazing at Azhe with naked admiration. “Can I learn this from you? Will you teach me?”

To everyone present, it was obvious Zhao Xue sought this out of whimsy. Naturally, Azhe had no intention of obliging.

Shaking his head, he replied, “Unless you join the sect, such teachings are forbidden. I cannot act on my own to impart these arts. Moreover, immortal cultivation demands years of dedication—it cannot be grasped through casual dabbling.”

Old Master Zhao, nearly collapsing from fright earlier, now stared in awe. To ordinary folk like him, controlling wind and lightning seemed the domain of deities—yet here it unfolded before his very eyes, defying belief.

“Xiao Xue, are you unharmed?” he asked urgently once he regained his composure.

“Of course.” Zhao Xue hesitated, then ventured carefully, “If possible… would you consider becoming one of my prospective husbands?”

To Guan Yu’s eyes, Zhao Xue’s interest stemmed purely from curiosity about Azhe’s magic. Given the Zhao family’s stature, they’d never choose someone as ordinary as Azhe otherwise.

The question flustered Azhe. Though he secretly yearned for this, its sudden reality left him tongue-tied.

“Don’t be shy!” Wang Jun shouted from below, mercilessly stripping away any pretense. “This is why you came up here! Act like a man!”

“Is this appropriate?” Guan Yu murmured with amusement. “You’ve hung Azhe out to dry. He’s reserved—how will he save face now?”

Wang Jun chuckled. “What’s there to fear? If he doesn’t speak up, he’ll miss his chance.”

Azhe’s face burned crimson under this prodding. With no one to rescue him, he steadied himself and answered, “If you permit… it would be my greatest honor.”

Zhao Xue approved of his composed response. Guan Yu mused that should this match succeed, it might be fortuitous—Azhe was no longer young, and a wealthy, beautiful wife would be a worthy blessing.

Siqi looked startled. “Could they actually…?”

“Not so easily.” Wang Jun guffawed, pointing. “Look at Azhe’s face—red as a monkey’s rear! Hahaha!”

**Chapter 4401: A Performance for You**

“Azhe remains merely a candidate for now,” Guan Yu explained. “Others must have their chance. The final selection comes later.”

Being the first candidate marked a promising start for Azhe. Whether Zhao Xue ultimately chose him depended on fate—no deception could sway this.

Zhao Xue fetched several gold ingots herself, bypassing servants. “Take these,” she offered Azhe, “as thanks for your spellcraft display.”

“I cannot.” Azhe waved them aside. “I didn’t come for gold.” His refusal underscored his true intentions.

Wang Jun slapped his thigh in frustration. “The fool! Rejecting gold? Is he bewitched? She hasn’t even chosen him yet!”

Suddenly, a figure swaggered onto the arena. “Well, Azhe! Fancy seeing you show off here. Bringing shame to Yunqing Sect?”

Guan Yu’s brow furrowed—the pest Ling Su had arrived, threatening to disrupt Azhe’s hard-won opportunity.

“Is he your friend?” Zhao Xue inquired.

“A senior brother.” Azhe bowed. “I’ll take my leave to observe.”

“Your senior brother? Then his magic surpasses yours?” Zhao Xue pressed.

Before Azhe could answer, Ling Su ogled Zhao Xue and boasted, “Naturally! His petty tricks are child’s play to me. Fair lady, allow me to demonstrate true power!”

Having witnessed Azhe’s second spell earlier, Ling Su now sought to upstage him, confident his looks and skills outshone Azhe’s.

Zhao Xue’s initial courtesy faded under Ling Su’s lecherous gaze. Her distrust extended to Azhe—how could virtuous men keep such company?

“You may perform,” Old Master Zhao interjected, “but recall our rule: no challenges from cultivators.”

“Why him and not me?” Ling Su sneered. “I’m far superior. If he’s a candidate, so am I!”

“Our rules stand,” the patriarch coldly replied. “Defy them, and you’ll be removed.”

Azhe departed quietly, refusing to share Ling Su’s disgrace.

“Then give me that gold,” Ling Su demanded, reaching for Zhao Xue’s ingots. “I’ll show you real magic.”

She withdrew her hand. “Perform first. Payment depends on my satisfaction.”

Reluctantly, Ling Su agreed—he needed the gold desperately. “Stand back! I’ll conjure wonders that dwarf his pitiful efforts!”

“Wait.” Zhao Xue halted him. “Perform last, after others have their turn. Leave now.”

Ling Su’s face darkened. Being dismissed after expecting easy gold enraged him. “I won’t wait! I’ll dazzle you now and be gone!”

At the patriarch’s signal, stewards approached. “Young master, you’re unwelcome here. Depart peacefully.”

**Chapter 4402: None of Your Concern**

Ling Su panicked as four burly servants surrounded him. “What? Ganging up on me? Is this the Zhao family’s honor?”

“Leave willingly,” the steward warned, “or be removed.”

Guan Yu sighed—Ling Su’s shamelessness knew bounds. Stepping forward, he called, “Ling Su! Cease this farce!”

Hearing Guan Yu, Ling Su forced a grin. Though seething, he remembered needing Guan Yu’s favor after alienating Lin Chen.

“Merely jesting!” Ling Su backtracked. “No need for tension. I’ll go.”

His abrupt retreat surprised everyone. Wang Jun laughed. “He fled from your glare!”

“For Azhe’s sake,” Guan Yu said. “This chance is rare.”

Azhe sighed. “Zhao Xue favors my magic, not me.”

“Idiot!” Wang Jun snapped. “Why refuse the gold?”

“I’m no beggar,” Azhe retorted.

Below the stage, Zhao Xue studied Guan Yu. Though not ostentatious, his presence outshone others—an unspoken magnetism that marked him apart.
