“Hearing Qin Taitian’s praise, Young Master Men couldn’t stop grinning. He asked, ‘Young Master Qin, could you give a detailed appraisal and explain the merits and unique qualities of this jade?’

Young Master Men felt utterly delighted. Finally, he possessed something to flaunt before them. Previously, he could only watch as others displayed their treasures, but now he could finally hold his head high.

‘Upon touch, the jade pendant feels cool and smooth with a fleshy texture—already top-grade in craftsmanship. Its form is exquisitely symmetrical, shaped like a Bagua trigram, yet it appears naturally formed rather than carved by human hands. Such beauty is truly rare.

When held against sunlight, a crimson vein within the jade forms the image of a Bagua trigram. This makes the pendant extraordinarily marvelous. Indeed, it is a remarkable treasure.’

‘Heheh, Young Master Qin,’ Men said with a smirk. ‘What you’ve described is obvious to all. Have you noticed nothing else extraordinary about it?’

‘Oh? Are there even more wondrous aspects? I’ve yet to perceive them,’ Qin replied, scrutinizing the jade.

**Chapter 3444: Drunk on Triumph**

With a laugh, Men retrieved the jade Bagua. Pinching its edge between his fingers, he walked to the window and raised it toward the sun. ‘Come and look closely,’ he beckoned.

Qin Taitian and the two Zhao brothers approached, craning their necks to examine the pendant. Even Xiao Bao, the attendant standing nearby, edged closer in curiosity.

‘Observe the crimson veins inside the jade—they’re slowly flowing. Do you see it?’ Men exclaimed excitedly.

Under intense scrutiny, the group indeed noticed what Men described: within the translucent green jade, scarlet threads coalesced into a Bagua pattern that imperceptibly rotated. The movement was glacial—shifting mere fractions every dozen seconds—making it easy to overlook without careful observation.

The crimson veins spun like embroidered threads trapped within the jade’s淡绿 hues, maintaining their trigram shape without dispersing. At six centimeters in diameter and a mere five millimeters thick, the pendant’s flawless craftsmanship bordered on miraculous. The revelation of its inner motion deepened the wonder.

‘You’re right!’ Zhao Eldest Brother gasped, pointing. ‘The crimson lines have shifted position—they’re truly moving!’

Men basked in their astonishment. This was precisely the reaction he craved.

Though Qin Taitian was no paragon of virtue, his worldly experience told him this pendant transcended ordinary trinkets. ‘Young Master Men, congratulations on acquiring such a treasure. Might I inquire where you obtained it?’

Having achieved his goal of inciting envy, Men tucked the jade away. ‘Truthfully, I stumbled upon it by chance. But destiny decreed it should be mine. Wherever it lay, it was fated to return to my hands.’

His words carried an unspoken warning: *This treasure is mine. Dare not covet it.*

Qin paced thoughtfully before sitting. ‘This jade is extraordinary—no mundane artifact.’

‘How so?’ Zhao Second Brother scoffed. ‘It’s just an ornate pendant.’

‘Consider this,’ Qin countered. ‘The crimson veins flow as if liquid, yet the jade’s thinness precludes internal fluids. If not liquid, how do the lines move? This phenomenon defies nature. I suspect this pendant serves purposes beyond adornment.’

Men’s composure faltered. Qin’s reasoning struck true—the jade’s marvels surely concealed deeper secrets.

As the Zhao brothers returned to their seats, waiters began delivering dishes—soon stacking three layers high on the table.

Zhao Eldest Brother chuckled. ‘Surely you overcomplicate matters, Brother Qin. Must there be intrigue behind Young Master Men’s serendipitous find?’

‘Who can say?’ Qin smiled coldly. ‘But my instincts seldom err.’

Privately, Qin recognized the pendant’s resemblance to high-grade magical artifacts. The flowing veins suggested spirit energy channels. Yet without cultivators present to verify, speculation remained.

‘Young Master Men,’ Qin proposed, ‘I’ve heard cultivators currently reside at my estate. If you’re willing, let them examine the jade’s mysteries.’

Men clutched his treasure protectively. ‘No need for trouble. I’ll study it in due time.’ Changing tack, he inquired, ‘Speaking of your guests—this Guan Yu staying at your home. What family’s scion is he?’

Qin blinked in confusion. ‘Guan Yu? I’ve been traveling until yesterday and know nothing of this. Perhaps he’s my father’s associate.’

Men frowned. That morning, Guan Yu had claimed the Qin estate as his uncle’s home. Why would Qin Taitian not recognize a cousin?

**Chapter 3445: Don’t Stop Me**

‘Aren’t your relatives visiting?’ Men pressed. ‘Rumor says a noble from the capital?’

‘Capital nobility?’ Qin echoed, bewildered. The Qins had no such connections.

Masking ignorance, Qin waved dismissively. ‘I’ll investigate upon returning. Now, let’s feast!’

As servers piled dishes precariously, Qin’s smile stiffened. The gluttonous spread—clearly exploiting his wealth—rankled. Xiao Bao entered beaming. ‘Young Masters, does the banquet please you?’

Qin’s glare wiped the smile from her face. Zhao Second Brother pointed at the mountainous table. ‘Fetch your madam. Now.’

Xiao Bao paled. ‘Sh-she’s occupied...’

‘**Insolence!**’ Zhao’s roar sent the girl kneeling. ‘You dare defy me?’

Men interceded with a chuckle. ‘Brother Zhao, why terrorize a serving girl?’

‘Since Men pleads for you,’ Zhao sneered, ‘rise. But bring your madam—*immediately*.’

Xiao Bao fled tearfully. As the men drank, Zhao Eldest Brother toasted, ‘To Men’s treasure!’

Qin forced cheer, though the wasteful excess galled him. When Zhao Second Brother later demanded the madam’s presence again, tension thickened the air.

**Chapter 3446: Enough Is Enough**

The Zhao brothers, though influential, weren’t brutes. Zhao Second Brother particularly disdained lower-class women like Xiao Bao, valuing status over beauty.

When the trembling madam arrived, Zhao gestured at the absurd feast. ‘Explain this gluttony.’

Before she could respond, Qin cut in. ‘Let it rest. We’ll settle accounts later.’ His tone brooked no argument—the first hint of true authority he’d shown all evening.

The unspoken message hung clear: The Qins’ reputation couldn’t afford petty squabbles, but neither would they tolerate exploitation. As cups refilled, Men’s triumphant glow slowly dimmed beneath the weight of unspoken suspicions about his miraculous jade...
