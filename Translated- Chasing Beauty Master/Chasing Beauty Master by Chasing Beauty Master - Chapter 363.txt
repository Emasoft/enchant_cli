“Who knows? Maybe it’s even more valuable than this Ferrari!” Zhao Yan joked.

Chen Gang was amused by Zhao Yan’s remark and teased, “Old Yan, it’s late at night and you’re still not asleep? You’re already daydreaming! That pile of scrap paper is worth more than that car? If that’s true, I’ll chop off my head and let you use it as a stool!”

“Heh, then you’d better start chopping! The document in his hand is indeed more valuable than that car!”

At that moment, a faint laugh suddenly rang in Chen Gang’s ear.

The expressions of Zhao Yan and Chen Gang instantly changed. They turned their heads simultaneously and found a lean figure standing beside them out of thin air. The person appeared remarkably young.

The newcomer was Guan Yu.

Though Zhao Yan and Chen Gang didn’t recognize him, one thing was certain: this man was not part of their organization.

Realizing this, their faces paled repeatedly. They couldn’t comprehend how this person had entered the locked dealership or appeared before them like a ghost.

Regardless, their shady dealings couldn’t be exposed. Anyone who discovered them had to die.

“Alert! Enemy intrusion!”

Almost immediately upon seeing Guan Yu, both men drew black pistols from their waists and shouted, drawing the attention of their subordinates.

But Guan Yu, equipped with a detection system, was faster.

As they reached for their guns, Guan Yu closed the distance in a blink. The ancient coin in his mind glowed brightly as his gravity system activated. His hands shot out, seizing their wrists. A slight twist—

Crack. Crack.

Zhao Yan and Chen Gang’s pistol-holding hands snapped. The guns clattered to the floor.

With a gentle pull, Guan yanked both men toward him, gripping their throats. Their lives hung by a thread.

Everything happened in an instant. By the time the others surrounded Guan Yu, it was too late.

**Chapter 913: Dealership Showdown (Part 2)**

“Phantom” perfectly described Guan Yu!

In this vast dealership with over a dozen men, Guan Yu moved like a shadow. His detection and gravity systems allowed him to effortlessly capture the two leaders undetected.

To Zhao Yan and Chen Gang, this intruder’s sudden appearance was utterly baffling.

Guan Yu’s actions left them deeply shaken. Still gripping their throats, he smirked. “Stay still unless I say otherwise!”

Chen Gang seethed but restrained himself. “Friend! We’re from the Noble Family. Let’s talk this out to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.”

“No need. I’m here for my friend’s car and that document.” Guan Yu nodded at Zhao Yan’s file.

“Impossible!” Chen Gang growled. The Noble Family never returned stolen cars. Surrendering now would shame their reputation.

“You misunderstand.” Guan Yu tightened his grip. “You’re in no position to refuse.”

Chen Gang’s face flushed as breathing turned labored. His men edged closer.

“Will your men save you faster,” Guan Yu mused, “or will I snap your neck first?”

Seizing their leader left the underlings directionless. Yet Chen Gang snarled, “Kill him!”

The men charged. Guan Yu yanked Zhao Yan and Chen Gang together—their skulls collided with a dull *thud*. Dazed, they crumpled as Guan Yu kicked Chen Gang into the crowd, disrupting their formation.

Zhao Yan, clutching the crucial file, fared worse. Guan宇 hurled him into others, knocking them out.

Within minutes, four men lay unconscious; others nursed injuries. Guan Yu stood unscathed, a stark contrast to the carnage.

**Chapter 914: Destroyed Luxury Cars**

Gunfire erupted. Bullets shredded the Porsche Guan Yu hid behind. He rolled behind a Ferrari—now riddled with holes—as bullets chased him.

The gang’s firepower stunned him. In this garage lay forbidden firearms: pistols, micro-Uzis, even an AK-47.

Gunfire paused. Guan Yu’s detection system mapped the entire garage. He counted footsteps approaching.

*Three... Two... One!* Activating his gravity system, he leaped into a Ferrari. The engine roared to life.

“Close the gates! Don’t let him escape!” Chen Gang bellowed.

But Guan Yu gunned the engine, crashing through the garage door. Tires screeched as he vanished into the night.

**Chapter 915: Reclaiming the File**

Back at the dealership, chaos reigned. Eight luxury cars lay destroyed. Chen Gang trembled with rage—this loss would cost him dearly.

Meanwhile, Guan宇 sped through streets, the stolen file secure. He’d return it to Li Xi, mission accomplished. The Noble Family’s wrath would come later—but for now, victory was his.
