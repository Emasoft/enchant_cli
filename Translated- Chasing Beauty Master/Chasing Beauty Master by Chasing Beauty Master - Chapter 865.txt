Ma He was also uncertain about the extent of Guan Yu’s injuries. The mysterious shield surrounding Guan Yu made it impossible to gauge his true condition. Therefore, Ma He refrained from acting rashly, instead continuously circulating his internal energy within his body. “Guan Yu, I respect you as a master. I believe your true strength far exceeds that of a Second-Class Supreme. But today, in this one-on-one battle, you stand no chance of victory.”

He was right. In a direct confrontation, Guan Yu truly had no hope of winning. But Guan Yu was stalling for time. Earlier, upon learning of Ma He’s involvement, he had already called for reinforcements. Now, he waited for rescue to arrive.

Unable to fight, Guan Yu could only delay. “Ma He, days ago, you colluded with the Feng Family to kidnap my friend. We reported this to the authorities. Though the Fengs bribed their way out, they pinned all blame on you. As a foreigner, you’re now wanted across all of Huaxia. Do you truly believe you still have a way out?”

Chapter 2247: Indeed, There Was a Problem

After escaping from Guan Yu last time, severely wounded, Ma He had secluded himself in a quiet place to recuperate. During his recovery, he encountered his junior sister.

Initially, they clashed violently. Though Ma He was gravely injured, his junior sister’s cultivation was inferior, leaving them at an impasse. Eventually, they sat down to negotiate.

Discovering their shared enemy in Guan Yu, they quietly healed together. Once recovered, the junior sister sought to track down Uncle Qing. They devised a plan: Ma He would help her kill Uncle Qing, and she would then assist him in dealing with Guan Yu. The strike against Uncle Qing was set for tonight.

Yet they hadn’t anticipated Guan Yu’s reinforcements arriving so swiftly. While the junior sister prepared to flee, Ma He’s pride as a master kept him unflinching.

Last time, Ma He had been outmatched only because Jones fought alongside Guan Yu. This time, if the junior sister could hold off Jones, Ma He was confident he could kill Guan Yu alone.

But fate proved unpredictable. Guan Yu’s resilience shocked Ma He. Under the full force of his strike, ordinary men would have been reduced to dust—yet Guan Yu remained standing, unharmed.

As for Guan Yu’s claim about the manhunt, Ma He knew nothing. The Fengs’ betrayal also came as news, for he’d been isolated during his recovery.

“Instead of targeting me, you’d be better off settling scores with the Feng Family,” Guan Yu said, observing the shifting expressions on Ma He’s face.

Enraged by the Fengs’ treachery, Ma He roared, “Perfect! After I kill you today, I’ll demand answers from them! With the entire Huaxia police hunting me, I’ve nowhere left to hide. Dying alongside you would be a worthy end!”

Guan Yu inwardly cursed. His attempt to buy time had backfired, provoking Ma He into seeking mutual destruction. *You might want to die, but I don’t!*

“How can you be so blind?” Guan Yu hurriedly argued. “The Fengs are your true enemies! When I killed Ma Hai, it was their scheme—they used him against me! I had no choice!”

“I care nothing for excuses. Only results matter.” Ma He rose from the ground, having regained much of his strength. If he struck now, Guan Yu would surely perish.

“Very well. If you insist on killing me, come. I can’t even lift a finger. My life is yours for the taking.” Guan Yu spoke with feigned despair.

Immediately, Ma He grew wary. Guan Yu’s cunning was legendary—such resignation had to be a ruse.

Guan Yu’s act bought him a reprieve. Fearful of traps, Ma He hesitated to approach.

“What trickery are you plotting now?” Ma He demanded.

“What tricks could a dying man muster? Even breathing pains me. Kill me quickly if you dare—stop dithering like a coward!” Guan Yu taunted.

Ma He’s suspicion deepened. Guan Yu’s defiance felt unnatural. He halted his advance.

Relieved, Guan Yu seized the delay. *His paranoia saves me!* But as his focus wavered, a surge of true qi tore through him. He coughed blood, staining his lips.

Ma He’s earlier strike had been devastating. Only Guan Yu’s superior inner energy had shielded him from annihilation.

Seeing Guan Yu’s condition worsen, Ma He laughed. “Today truly marks your end, Guan Yu! When you meet the King of Hell, send regards to my younger brother!” He drew a dagger gleaming coldly in the night.

As the blade plunged toward Guan Yu’s heart—

*Clang!*

Metal screeched. Guan Yu remained leaning against a sapling. Ma He flew backward, crashing to the ground, a deep gash splitting his chest.

Second Only to Wolf had arrived.

“You’ve been here all along, watching my struggle,” Guan Yu said hoarsely.

The warrior shrugged. “I arrived moments ago. A second later, you’d be dead.”

“Lies! I sensed your presence when he threatened mutual destruction. Why wait until the last moment?”

Chapter 2248: Internal Injuries

Second Only to Wolf studied Guan Yu curiously. A Second-Class Supreme detecting a First-Class Supreme’s aura? Unheard of.

“You truly sensed me? Impossible!”

“My perception exceeds my cultivation. Even peak masters struggle to hide from me.” Guan Yu’s tone bordered on arrogance.

Second Only to Wolf’s intrigue grew. “When did I arrive?”

“When he vowed to die with me. Admit it.”

“True,” the warrior conceded. “You’re fascinating. No wonder my sister cares for you.” He helped Guan Yu stand, avoiding mention of the sister’s identity.

Approaching Ma He’s near-lifeless form, they deemed him beyond threat. As they prepared to aid Jones, the man himself arrived with Uncle Qing and disciples.

“Guan Yu! Are you hurt?” Uncle Qing rushed forward.

“A minor injury. The junior sister escaped?”

Jones nodded. “She fled when your friend killed Ma He. These bloodstains aren’t yours, I see.”

Guan Yu introduced Second Only to Wolf as “Ah Lang.” The warrior explained, “Her clones were masterful. Few can manifest equals to their true power. Had she reached First-Class Supreme...”

Uncle Qing’s eyes lit up. “The one you mentioned—could he be her ancestor?”

Ah Lang departed after ensuring their safety.

“We must relocate you,” Guan Yu urged Uncle Qing. “The police will investigate Ma He’s death here.”

Chapter 2249: Needless Alarm

Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu’s bloodied shirt sent the women into panic.

Yang Conghan remained composed. “What happened? Is it resolved?”

Xue Jing, though calmer, insisted, “I’m informing your sisters!”

“Don’t overreact! They likely already know!” Guan Yu protested.

A-Mei wept in the bathroom, convinced he was dying. Xue Jing reassured her, “It’s just internal injuries. He’ll recover.”

“But there’s so much blood!”

“Most isn’t his. Ma He’s blood sprayed when Ah Lang struck.”

Zhang Han’s announcement that Guan Yu summoned her dried A-Mei’s tears instantly. “He doesn’t want to see tears,” the girl added.

Sniffling, A-Mei hurried out, determined to appear brave.
