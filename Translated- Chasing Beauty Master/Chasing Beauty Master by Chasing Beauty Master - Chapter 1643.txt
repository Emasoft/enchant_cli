“Oh? What do you mean by this? Do you object to Our decision? Or are you pleading mercy for Minister Ran?” The Emperor coldly stared at the First Prince. Publicly contradicting imperial decrees was precisely what His Majesty despised most.

The Second Prince watched from the side, suppressing a smirk. *What a fool*, he thought. *To openly defy the Emperor at such a time is sheer masquerade of suffering.*

“Imperial Father, this son does not mean that. Consider—this matter is of grave importance. Preserving Minister Ran may aid our investigation. Keeping him alive could still prove useful,” the First Prince argued.

“Then explain—what use is he now? He’s already divulged all he knows. What further assistance could such a man provide?” the Emperor countered.

The First Prince pressed on: “Minister Ran remains pivotal. His jurisdiction covers the disaster-stricken regions. Many affairs still require his handling. Though we must thoroughly investigate last year’s brazen embezzlement of relief funds, this demands methodical inquiry before punishment. Our immediate priority is distributing aid to reassure the people and restore stability. Only Minister Ran, with his decades governing Hanbei’s terrain, can manage this effectively. Thus, his execution must be delayed.”

The reasoning sounded plausible. As the Emperor hesitated, Grand Councillor Yu Kong approached and whispered: “Your Majesty, the First Prince speaks wisely. Containing the disaster and securing public trust are paramount. His Highness demonstrates both intellect and initiative. Entrusting him this task would test his capabilities. Should he fail, his incompetence would be exposed. If he succeeds, he becomes Your Majesty’s reliable right hand.”

Having served the throne for decades, Yu Kong excelled at reading imperial moods. His timely suggestion offered the wavering monarch an elegant solution. After contemplation, the Emperor nodded. “Very well. Since this idea originated from you,” he pointed at the First Prince, “We charge you with its execution. We shall allocate twenty million taels to disaster regions—first pacify the people, then reinforce the embankments. Ensure no further Hanbei floods reach Our ears. Understood? Do you possess the confidence to succeed?”

“This son accepts the decree! I shall spare no effort to fulfill this duty without disappointing Imperial Father.” The First Prince inwardly rejoiced—his desired opportunity had materialized.

The Emperor’s nod carried warning. “See that you don’t bungle this. Should silver go missing again, present your head before Us.”

The First Prince calculated silently. Transporting such vast sums across great distances posed challenges. Last year’s two million taels had vanished mysteriously. With worsened disasters, even doubled funds might prove insufficient. Yet requesting more now risked imperial displeasure. Adopting indirect tactics, he turned to Minister Ran: “How fares Hanbei’s current plight? Does it surpass last year’s severity?”

“Catastrophic,” Minister Ran replied. “Floods have submerged multiple villages along the Hanbei River’s lower reaches. Casualties remain uncounted, but displaced survivors already near a thousand.”

“Then does Imperial Father’s allocated two million taels suffice for relief?” The First Prince’s pointed question strategically shifted responsibility.

The Second Prince immediately bristled. “What are you implying? Accusing Imperial Father of stinginess? Or plotting embezzlement? Two million taels could sustain two thousand commoners! Those lowly wretches need mere coppers each!”

“This matter no longer concerns you,” the First Prince coldly retorted. “Imperial Father has entrusted it to me. The silver’s amount bears no relation to you. Hold your tongue.”

The Second Prince gnashed his teeth, barely restraining himself from lunging forward. Yet recalling Prince Zou’s recent demise softened his rage. *Let’s see you bungle this*, he seethed silently. *Your precious ally lies dead on the roadside. We’ll witness what support remains when you fail.*

Ignoring the provocation, the First Prince addressed the throne: “This year’s calamity exceeds last’s in scale and suffering. I humbly petition for increased funds.”

The Emperor glanced at Yu Kong, receiving a subtle nod. “We approve. To the original twenty million, add fifteen—totaling thirty-five million taels. Ensure Hanbei’s embankments become impregnable. No repeat disasters shall be tolerated.”

“Your son obeys!” The First Prince bowed triumphantly. This grand commission eclipsed the Second Prince’s influence completely.

“One final request—Minister Ran’s assistance would prove invaluable given his regional expertise.”

“Granted,” the Emperor decreed. “Minister Ran shall serve under you temporarily. We’ll settle accounts post-disaster.” At his gesture, guards departed.

Minister Ran kowtowed loudly, forehead striking stone thrice. “This unworthy servant thanks Your Majesty’s mercy! I shall devote myself wholly to assisting His Highness in ameliorating Hanbei’s plight!”

The Second Prince’s discontent erupted anew. “Imperial Father, entrusting such funds to an inexperienced prince risks disaster! His lack of authority invites disobedience. Another appointee would—”

“Cease your contempt!” the First Prince interjected. “You covet this commission’s profits? Control your greed. After stabilizing the people, I’ll investigate last year’s embezzlement. All connected parties—including any royal kin—shall face justice!”

His sweeping accusation silenced the court. Innocent officials prayed to avoid implication; guilty ones trembled—some in fear, others simmering with resentment. *Let the Second Prince deal with this upstart*, the boldest schemed. *His newfound arrogance won’t last.*

“Grand boasts from one who couldn’t protect his own ally!” The Second Prince sneered. “A hundred elite guards proved useless. Prince Zou lies dead, yet here you preen—”

The Emperor stiffened. Prince Zou’s alleged demise surprised even Yu Kong. The First Prince masked his shock—confirmation must await private channels.

“Irrelevant theatrics!” the First Prince countered coolly. “Imperial Father’s trust suffices. Should I fail, His Majesty alone shall judge me—not jealous siblings.”

The Second Prince frowned. His brother’s composure contradicted expectations. Even Emperor and councillor exchanged uncertain glances.

“This matter is settled,” the Emperor declared. “We trust the First Prince’s capabilities.”

Returning to his residence, the First Prince urgently dispatched agents to verify Prince Zou’s status. A messenger arrived bearing a coded letter—four characters: “Smooth passage.” Relief flooded him; the Second Prince’s taunts were mere provocations. With Prince Zou safe and disaster funds secured, Hanbei’s mission took priority.

His mentor Xiang Shouzuo emerged, admonishing: “Your thoughts remain transparent. Master subtlety—opponents exploit visible anxieties.”

“Teacher’s wisdom guides me. Soon I depart with thirty-five million taels. This absence may prove lengthy.”

“A crucial opportunity,” Xiang nodded. “Succeed here, and your standing becomes unassailable. Beware the Second Prince’s sabotage—expect highway ambushes using mercenaries. If outmatched, yield the silver but secure evidence. Exposure would ruin him.”

“Gratitude for your guidance. How long before your return?”

“A ruler cannot lean forever. Hone independence—read opponents’ minds, wage psychological battles. Steadiness prevails.” As Xiang departed, he added: “Prince Zou nears the capital. My presence risks exposure—that Guan Yu’s perceptiveness exceeds hiding.”

Chapter 4291: Follow Me

At noon, the capital’s walls loomed. Prince Zou dismounted, murmuring “Like emerging from another lifetime.” His survival defied odds—countless ambushes thwarted by Guan Yu’s band. Now, under the Son of Heaven’s shadow, assassins dared not strike.

A procession of palace eunuchs approached. Prince Zou’s tribulations had only begun.
