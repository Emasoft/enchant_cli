The situation at the gambling den had escalated gravely. Even with all the hired thugs they usually maintained, they couldn't withstand the fury of players who had lost money. The chaos had persisted from morning till afternoon, and as news spread, even those who had previously lost money there came demanding explanations.

With Boss Zhou absent, no one knew how to handle things. They couldn't possibly compensate everyone, especially since most protesters had no concrete evidence to prove the establishment had cheated.

Eventually, even Guan Yu from the west side of town heard of the commotion. Though initially inclined to investigate, he reconsidered—this was another's affair. If the den truly operated dishonestly, it deserved rectification. If innocent, they'd resolve it themselves. Thus, Guan Yu stayed out of it. Knowing Boss Zhou's absence complicated matters, he feared blame if things went awry.

By nightfall, Lin Chen finally arrived, dust-covered and weary. Though cultivators cared little for rest, prolonged travel had taken its toll. "I've settled everything," Lin Chen announced. "Master Xuanming gave me another five hundred taels of silver, entrusting me to manage our provisions and lodging."

The group happened to be dining together. Guan Yu noted Lin Chen's resourcefulness but remained skeptical about the silver. "Five hundred taels? Don't forget you still owe two hundred," Guan Yu reminded.

"I went to repay the debt, but they said it was settled. Didn't you handle it?"

"I did—with my own silver," Guan Yu retorted. "If Master only gave five hundred, return my two hundred first. Manage the remaining three hundred as you please."

"Three hundred?" Ling Su interjected. "How could that suffice for such a long journey? It's nowhere enough!"

**Chapter 4411: None of Your Business**

"If it's insufficient, go beg Master for more," Lin Chen shrugged. "I find it adequate. Once we reach the desert, we'll barely need silver anyway."

Guan Yu marveled at Lin Chen's meticulous calculations. Three hundred taels might indeed suffice, yet he doubted Xuanming would be so stingy. "Wait," Guan Yu pressed. "Does that five hundred include your debt? If not, I'll demand the full five hundred from Master later. If it does, repay me now."

"Of course it's included," Lin Chen patted his waist. "Take it now if you wish." He feared Guan Yu confronting Xuanming would expose his lies—not only hiding his mistakes but framing Ling Su.

Guan Yu extended his hand. "This silver is mine. Anyone needing funds may borrow from me—depending on my mood." Lin Chen handed over a pouch of two hundred taels, clearing his debt.

"The remaining three hundred covers our journey," Lin Chen declared. "Complainers can borrow from Guan Yu—but it won't come from our shared funds."

Guan Yu grimaced. Lin Chen had deftly shifted responsibility onto him. Having publicly offered loans, he couldn't refuse—except to Lin Chen and Ling Su.

Ling Su stood, smirking. "Lin Chen, how did you explain losing all that silver and your debt to Master? What punishment did he give? That's what we all want to know."

"None of your business," Lin Chen retorted haughtily. "I brought the silver—be content with food and shelter. Master dotes on me. When I said I needed funds, he gave five hundred taels without question."

None believed him, but none could disprove it.

**Chapter 4412: Who Do You Think You Are?**

At dawn, the group set out on camels, progressing painfully slowly. "We won't reach Ox Town today," Guan Yu observed. "We'll camp outdoors. Fortunately, we're well-prepared."

Each of the twenty travelers carried heavy loads—manageable here but impractical deeper into the desert, where camels couldn't bear excess weight. In arid lands, camels mattered more than men—without them, survival beyond a day was impossible.

As dusk fell, Guan Yu surveyed the featureless plains. "We'll rest here tonight." The flat terrain offered safety from ambushes, and their identities remained concealed.

Ling Su groaned. "Sleep here? Mosquitoes will devour us!"

Indeed, swarms buzzed relentlessly, but tents provided refuge. "Go ahead alone if you prefer," Lin Chen yawned. "I'm exhausted."

Guan Yu dismounted. "Forgive tonight's discomfort. Eat your rations. I'll gather firewood—the flames will warm us and repel insects."

He pondered if acquiring camels in Liaozhou City had been wise. Other travelers—including cultivators—had kept horses, bypassing camels until nearer the desert. Yet Guan Yu trusted Liaozhou's camels over those at Camel Town, despite the slower pace. They still had time before the seventh-month deadline.

**Chapter 4413: The Fire**

At nightfall, tents rose around a crackling fire. Guan Yu placed Siqi's tent nearest the flames, surrounded by Wang Jun and A Ze's. Though daytime temperatures were mild, nights grew cold—the fire vital for warmth.

Ling Su lingered outside, seething. Siqi's earlier rejection—"I detest speaking with you"—gnawed at him. Convinced Lin Chen had poisoned her against him, he plotted revenge.

By midnight, Lin Chen's thunderous snores echoed. Ling Su snatched a burning branch, face twisted in malice. He'd burn Lin Chen alive.

Approaching the tent, he raised the flaming brand—only to freeze at a sound. The narrative paused on his vengeful stance, the firelight etching madness across his features.
