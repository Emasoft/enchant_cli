“We’ve been stuck here all night, and these unlucky cops wouldn’t let us leave no matter what. It should be fine now—let’s head back.”

Guan Yu stood up first. A-Mei, whose timid nature bordered on the extreme, had been deeply shaken by the incident. Witnessing a living person being trampled to death firsthand had left her utterly terrified.

Patting A-Mei’s shoulder, Guan Yu comforted her, “With me here, you’ve nothing to fear. Forget being a big star. From now on, you’ll just be my woman.”

A-Mei’s delicate face flushed crimson as she lowered her head in silence. Noticing her bashfulness, Guan Yu teased, “What? Unwilling?”

Lü Mei jabbed him from behind. “Honestly! How can you say such things in front of everyone—especially your other women? How do you expect such a sweet girl to agree outright?”

Guan Yu glanced back and saw Xue Jing, Yang Conghan, Lü Mei, and even the hapless Wei Hongwei present. “Ah, right. This is awkward. Let’s discuss it privately at home later. Let’s go.”

The group exited through a private passage arranged for A-Mei to avoid lingering crowds outside. Yang Conghan summoned her bodyguards and proposed, “Since it’s late and my place is nearby, why don’t you all stay at my residence tonight? Guan Yu, what do you think?”

She directed the question at him, knowing his agreement would sway the others. Wei Hongwei, though a sworn brother who’d weathered life-and-death trials with Guan Yu, recognized the delicate dynamics of a polyamorous household. “Brother Guan, my family’s been calling repeatedly. I’ll head back now that things are settled.”

Guan Yu didn’t stop him, privately relieved. Yang Conghan’s invitation referred not to the Yang family estate but her private residence. Wei Hongwei’s departure spared them an awkward third wheel.

“Alright, everyone stays at Conghan’s tonight. Those who object can follow Wei Hongwei’s example—I won’t stop them.” Guan Yu’s gaze lingered on Lü Mei, the most opinionated of the group.

“Hmph! I’m not leaving! I won’t give anyone else opportunities!” Lü Mei declared, earning collective eye-rolls.

They departed in separate vehicles. Guan Yu rode with Xue Jing, the group’s de facto elder sister due to her longer history with him. A-Mei joined them, her quiet demeanor contrasting with the others’ liveliness.

Yang Conghan’s two-story house surprised Guan Yu with its modesty—unexpected for the heiress of the premier Yang family. The interior’s white and azure color scheme extended even to the sofa cushions, reflecting her aesthetic preferences.

“How is Patriarch Yang recovering?” Xue Jing asked once settled.

“Father’s condition improves daily. He swallows food independently now, and his eyelids occasionally twitch... though he hasn’t awakened.”

“That’s significant progress,” Guan Yu assured. “He’ll likely emerge stronger than ever.”

Yang Conghan’s rare smile surfaced. “We owe this to your desperate efforts.”

“We’re family—no need for formalities.” At Guan Yu’s words, Yang Conghan blushed, drawing attention from her blunt maid Jinhua.

“Little Han’s flushing again! Why not take Guan Yu to your room tonight?” Jinhua teased before being shooed away to fetch drinks.

Lü Mei, overhearing, protested, “Why should he sleep in her room? I knew him first! This backwater place terrifies me—I demand Guan Yu stays with me!”

Her “backwater” description drew incredulous looks—the house stood in A City’s bustling center.

“How about guards outside your door?” Guan Yu joked.

“You refuse me?!” Lü Mei erupted. “I’ve never let men touch me in eighteen years! You’re the ungrateful one!”

Her chest heaving dramatically, she resembled a village shrew until Guan Yu relented: “Fine, I’ll endure your company tonight.”

Yang Conghan countered, “My larger room would suit him better.”

“Are you saying I’m uncomfortable to sleep with?!” Lü Mei’s outrage escalated until Guan Yu interjected: “Enough! I’ll comfort A-Mei tonight.”

The timid starlet hid her crimson face as Guan Yu carried her upstairs, leaving the others gaping.

Next morning, A-Mei descended awkwardly, her altered gait drawing knowing looks. At breakfast, Jinhua remarked loudly, “Such noise last night! Completely扰民!”

Lü Mei joined in: “Indeed! Who knew such a quiet girl could be so loud?”

Clueless, A-Mei asked, “What noise?”—toppling the group with her innocence.

Guan Yu changed the subject to car shopping. When Yang Conghan and Lü Mei offered to buy vehicles, he deferred to Xue Jing’s financial connections.

Later at the renovated Huaye Club, Guan Yu approved demolition progress before receiving a call about afternoon taekwondo trials.

“Five finalists remain,” explained Chen Tianxiao. “We’ll eliminate one today.”

Surprised by multiple Third尊 practitioners, Guan Yu considered withdrawing until warned it would cause ridicule.

As they discussed strategies, Guan Yu’s thoughts drifted to car models—and which woman might gift him the fastest ride.
