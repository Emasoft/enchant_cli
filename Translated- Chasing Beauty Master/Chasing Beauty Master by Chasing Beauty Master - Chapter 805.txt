Guan Yu had not expected Cao Jin to seek him out. He was well aware that Cao Jin’s status at Century Garden Academy rivaled his own at Kaihuang Academy. Though the two schools had always maintained a “well water does not intrude on river water” relationship, what did this sudden approach signify?

“If your boss wants to see me, tell him to come himself. I don’t have time to deal with him right now,” Guan Yu said brusquely.

“Guan Yu, don’t mistake courtesy for weakness. Consider it an honor that our boss wants to meet you,” one of Cao Jin’s lackeys retorted.

“Go back and tell your boss to weigh his own worth before scheming,” Guan Yu snapped, stepping forward to glare down at one of the youths. “Move.”

The young man hesitated for a split second before Guan Yu’s foot lashed out in a vicious low kick to his groin, sending him sprawling. Without another glance, Guan Yu grabbed Lü Mei’s hand and strode to his car, leaving the scene.

Knowing they were outmatched, Cao Jin’s men slunk back to report their failure.

“Damn it! That arrogant prick!” Cao Jin roared upon hearing the news. “Gather everyone! We’re settling this today!”

After mobilizing over a hundred men and a fleet of vans, Cao Jin deliberately invited Wang Ting to witness the spectacle. The convoy screeched to a halt outside Kaihuang’s gates.

“Guan Yu! Get your ass out here!” Cao Jin bellowed as he stormed out.

Unbeknownst to him, Guan Yu had already left campus after escorting Lü Mei to class. Returning to Qiaoyuan District, Guan Yu informed A’mei and Zhang Han about Lü Mei’s upcoming stay, swapped his phone battery, and prepared to run errands for Jin Hua and Qing Ling’er. His phone rang just as he was leaving.

“Guan! It’s chaos! Cao Jin’s brought a mob blocking the school gates. No one can leave!” Wei Hongwei’s panicked voice crackled through.

“Mobilize the Yu Faction,” Guan Yu ordered before dialing the police. “Officer Huang Shan? There’s an unlawful assembly of over a hundred people trapping students at Kaihuang’s entrance...”

Hanging up, Guan Yu scoffed. Even the police would struggle against Cao Jin’s numbers. He’d have to handle this personally.

Arriving at the besieged campus, Guan Yu parked blocks away and approached on foot. The crowd parted like waves as whispers of “Guan Yu’s here!” rippled through. Cao Jin swaggered forward. “Thought you’d hide like a turtle? Got some guts showing up.”

“Trash like you should’ve learned your lesson last time. Blocking students? Pathetic.” Guan Yu’s smile never wavered. “You’ve just made enemies of every Kaihuang student.”

“You think I care?” Cao Jin sneered, hurling a machete at Guan Yu’s feet. “Cut off your own leg now, or I’ll do it for you.”

**Chapter 2042: Don’t Be So Arrogant**

Guan Yu suspected Li Yuan had orchestrated this, but Cao Jin’s denial rang true. Another enemy? Before he could ponder further, Cao Jin’s thugs encircled him.

The standoff broke when Wei Hongwei arrived with reinforcements—Wang Hu, Wei Yong, and the long-absent Chen Tianxiao. Guan Yu’s heart warmed at Tianxiao’s loyalty. “Since when did you join the Yu Faction?”

“How could I miss this?” Tianxiao grinned.

Cao Jin paled recognizing the martial arts champions. His numerical advantage crumbled as Kaihuang students flooded out, surrounding his men three to one. Police sirens wailed in the distance.

“Attack!” Wei Hongwei shouted. The brawl erupted instantly. Guan Yu, Tianxiao, and Wang Hu focused on Cao Jin, driving him back until a dagger flashed from the crowd—wielded by a cultivator. Guan Yu disarmed the assailant, but Cao Jin vanished in the chaos.

“HALT!” Guan Yu’s thunderous shout froze the battlefield. “Your coward leader fled! You’re committing crimes for a rat!”

The mob dissolved into panic as students jeered. Police finally pushed through, finding Cao Jin’s battered remnants surrendering. Guan Yu’s voice carried over the din: “They invaded our school. We defended ourselves.”

Amid the crowd, Wang Ting slipped away, shaking her head. Cao Jin’s humiliation was complete.

**Chapter 2043: Is This All You’ve Got?**

“You think I’m scared?!” Cao Jin roared, flinging his cigarette. “Attack!”

“Who dares?!” Wei Hongwei emerged with fifty Yu Faction members. Cao Jin’s face fell seeing Wang Hu and Chen Tianxiao.

Guan Yu pressed the assault, but cultivators among Cao Jin’s ranks slowed him. “Where’s that berserk form you showed at the tournament?” he taunted, recalling Cao Jin’s prior defeat.

The tide turned completely when police reinforcements arrived. Cornered, Cao Jin attempted to flee but found himself trapped by his own retreating men. Guan Yu’s palm strike sent him reeling—until a blade intervened.

After disarming the cultivator, Guan Yu spotted Cao Jin scrambling over a wall. “Your boss abandoned you!” he announced. The remaining invaders dropped their weapons, defeated less by force than by shame.

As officers handcuffed the instigators, Guan Yu watched Cao Jin’s escape route. This wasn’t over—but for today, Kaihuang stood triumphant.
