“If we report Guan Yu’s matter to the Cloud Azure Sect, he’ll be utterly finished. The Demon Lord would eliminate a thorn in his side, and I’d gain great merit. Then...”

“No!” The Left Envoy directly cut off Yan Zhao’s argument. He knew it wasn’t yet time to deal with Guan Yu. Even out of respect for the Young Master’s face, they couldn’t move against Guan Yu lightly.

The Left Envoy sat down on a chair and continued, “I’ve told you before—this matter isn’t as simple as you think. If you report this to the sect now, you’ll only provoke Guan Yu’s hatred. He might flee and disappear. Once he fully matures in the future, do you think you’ll have peaceful days?”

“Guan Yu isn’t within the Cloud Azure Sect now. If the sect moves against him, only two outcomes remain: either he’s driven to desperation by your sect’s pursuit and joins our Demon Soul Sect, or he escapes to hide and cultivate in secret. A dual cultivator of demonic and orthodox arts, once matured, is no trivial threat.”

“Thus, even if you report this to the sect now, Xuan Ming—that clever old fox—wouldn’t want Guan Yu to escape or join us. He likely wouldn’t punish Guan Yu but might instead blame you for stirring trouble. To silence you, who knows what Xuan Ming might do?”

Cold sweat dripped down Yan Zhao’s forehead as he listened. The Left Envoy spoke truth—Guan Yu was now a pivotal figure who couldn’t be touched.

If Xuan Ming learned of this, he’d never allow a dual cultivator to be forced into the Demon Soul Sect’s arms. The sect wouldn’t care whether Guan Yu truly possessed the Eight-Sided Drum technique. If he did, all the better—at least the Demon Lord wouldn’t obtain it.

Ultimately, all faults would fall on Yan Zhao himself. This matter couldn’t be handled rashly. They needed a perfect strategy and timing to expose Guan Yu, utterly destroying his reputation.

“The Left Envoy’s wisdom enlightens me. But what should I do next? If Guan Yu insists on going to the desert, I can’t dissuade him.”

“Don’t worry. Guan Yu may linger here for days. Leave the rest to me.” The Left Envoy stood and departed without looking back.

At the inn’s entrance, government soldiers finally subdued Ma Shan’s gang after tremendous effort. As they prepared to leave with the prisoners, newcomers blocked their path—Yue Jing and Lai Lixia of the Crimson Lotus Sect, come to reclaim their stolen jade Eight Trigrams artifact.

“Halt! Hand over that fat one,” Yue Jing demanded, pointing at the obese bandit leader.

Constable Han, accustomed to easy arrests, frowned at this interference. Recognizing the martial artists’ sect insignias, he cautiously asked, “These are felons guilty of murder and arson. Do you oppose the government?”

“We’re disciples of the righteous Crimson Lotus Sect. That fat thief stole our sacred artifact. We only seek its return,” Yue Jing declared.

When the bound bandit leader was presented, his gagged mouth could only mumble incoherently. Lai Lixia suddenly pointed at the innkeeper nearby—the man was gleefully examining the jade Eight Trigrams, unaware he held the contested artifact.

In a flash, Yue Jing’s sword pressed against the innkeeper’s throat. “Surrender the Eight Trigrams!”

“Thieves! Government soldiers, arrest them!” the innkeeper shrieked as Yue Jing snatched the jade.

Constable Han intervened reluctantly, “Is this truly your sect’s treasure?”

“Undoubtedly. Our business here concludes.” The Crimson Lotus disciples departed swiftly, leaving the innkeeper cursing: “So-called righteous sects—no better than bandits! Thieving bastards!”

After settling the commotion, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi returned to their rooms. “Why such lavish quarters?” Xiao Zhi complained.

“Elder Lu’s generosity,” Guan Yu shrugged. “Where’s Senior Brother Yan Zhao?”

“Probably drinking elsewhere,” Guan Yu smirked. “Your model senior brother is but a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”

Investigating Yan Zhao’s room revealed his absence. When the drunken senior brother finally stumbled in at midnight—disheveled with lipstick stains—Xiao Zhi’s heart sank. The model disciple drunkenly groped at serving girls until Xiao Zhi dragged him away.

At dawn, Guan Yu noted Yan Zhao’s haggard appearance. “Feeling unwell, Senior Brother?”

“Merely... lingering effects from last night,” Yan Zhao mumbled, adhering to the Left Envoy’s orders to delay their journey. “We should rest here a few days.”

Xiao Zhi objected, “But the sect urges haste! We must reach the desert before the fifteenth of July!”

“The Demon Soul Sect already has guides from Miao City’s fox demons,” Guan Yu countered. “Rushing won’t outpace them. Let your senior brother recover.”

Thus the trio settled into uneasy respite, each harboring secret agendas beneath the desert sun’s looming deadline.
