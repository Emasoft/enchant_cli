However, since Wan Hong's appearance, Jiang Xin's thoughts seemed to have undergone subtle changes. During that previous flight over the Imperial Son-in-Law's mansion when Guan Yu carried her through the skies – though he had touched places he shouldn't – instead of anger, she had felt only shyness. This shift in attitude marked a fundamental change within her.

When Guan Yu saved her at the most critical moment, he completely shattered her emotional defenses. Now she couldn't free her heart from him. Sometimes Jiang Xin wondered why her rescuer couldn't have been Chu Fan instead. How wonderful that would have been! Now she couldn't tell whether she liked Chu Fan more or Guan Yu more.

Jiang Xin longed to bravely face her feelings and openly admire Guan Yu. Yet his mysterious nature, formidable abilities, and most importantly, his existing relationships with two other women made it impossible for her to share her man. Unless she could overcome this psychological barrier, there would be no future.

Guan Yu gave her an overwhelming sense of security. Having such a man by her side, she believed, would ensure lifelong protection – this being the primary reason for her affection.

“I know you value loyalty most,” Jiang Xin said, “otherwise you wouldn't have risked yourself to save me. Still, I must thank you.” She continued, “I'll keep your rescue secret. My first condition is simple – take me flying again. I crave that sensation of soaring through the skies with you.”

“That's no trouble at all,” Guan Yu replied with a smile. Stepping forward, he wrapped one arm around her slender waist. Channeling spiritual energy, they instantly ascended into the night sky.

Looking down at the sprawling capital beneath – its grand palaces and bustling streets – Jiang Xin initially felt trepidation. But the overwhelming sense of safety from the man beside her soon dispelled all fear.

Though still somewhat shy from their close proximity, Jiang Xin's joy gradually overshadowed her embarrassment. In this moment, she forgot Chu Fan's perilous situation, forgot all past troubles, existing purely in this bubble of happiness.

“Look! There's my home!” Jiang Xin exclaimed excitedly, pointing at an elegant pavilion. Guan Yu followed her gesture to the distinctive red-walled structure of the Imperial Son-in-Law's mansion, easily identifiable even at night.

“This is wonderful! Wan Hong, let's circle the entire capital!” she pleaded cheerfully.

Guan Yu's smile froze. “My lady, the capital's vast expanse would take considerable time to circumnavigate, even at flying speed. Let's not indulge this whim.”

“I don't care! You promised!” Jiang Xin insisted stubbornly. With no alternative, Guan Yu complied. While flying solo would have been swift, carrying Jiang Xin at reduced speed drained his spiritual energy alarmingly. By the time they completed the circuit around the largest city in the martial world, Jiang Xin's elation contrasted sharply with Guan Yu's exhaustion. His poorly mastered flight technique forced him to summon the Soulfall Blade when his energy reserves nearly depleted.

The Imperial Princess had nightly rituals – checking Jiang Xin's peaceful sleep since childhood. Tonight's uneaten dinner and missing maid Xiaoyun raised alarms. Discovering Jiang Xin's ajar bedroom door, she entered to find bedding in disarray and the unconscious maid.

“Explain yourself!” The Princess's roar startled the groggy Xiaoyun awake. The maid recounted being struck by Jiang Xin with a candlestick. Observing Jiang Xin's discarded dress and Xiaoyun's borrowed clothes, the Princess grasped the situation. After dismissing the maid with a bedsheet covering, she stormed to her husband's study.

“Our daughter's fled!” she announced. Imperial Son-in-Law Jiang Yuan-kai immediately mobilized all guards. From their aerial vantage, Jiang Xin and Guan Yu witnessed the search parties scrambling below.

“You should return,” Guan Yu urged as they descended before the mansion gates. “Your parents must be frantic.”

Jiang Xin lingered reluctantly. “Remember your promise! This first condition isn't fully met!” she declared before impulsively kissing his cheek. “I love you,” she whispered, flushed. “No matter your feelings.”

Guan Yu stood frozen, guilt towards Chu Fan surfacing. Their moment shattered as Jiang Yuan-kai and the Princess rushed out.

“How could you vanish like this?” the Princess scolded. When Jiang Xin accused Xiaoyun of betrayal, her mother retorted, “You assaulted the maid! She still bears the injury!”

After placating her parents with claims of seeking Guan Yu's help for Chu Fan, Jiang Xin watched Guan Yu depart with lingering affection. “Don't forget our secret!” she called after him.

Returning to his inn, Guan Yu found Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi waiting. “How interesting,” Qiqi remarked acidly, “that delivering someone should take four hours. What nocturnal activities required circling the entire capital?”

Wang Xiaorong joined the assault: “We've waited all night while you reek of her perfume!” Qiqi plucked a long hair from his collar. “See? We're being replaced!”

Trapped, Guan Yu feigned discussions with Jiang Yuan-kai about the East Sea Dragon Pearl's connection to Eight-Drum cultivation. Qiqi immediately countered: “The mansion guards were searching until recently. If she'd returned early, why the commotion?”

“I’ve told you – there's nothing between us!” Guan Yu insisted, invoking brotherhood with Chu Fan. But the women remained unconvinced, their vigil ending in bitter accusations as dawn approached.
