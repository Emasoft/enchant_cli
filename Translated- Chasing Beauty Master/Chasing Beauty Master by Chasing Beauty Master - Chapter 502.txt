However, all explanations were futile now. Xia Yue'er's gaze had already made it clear to Guan Yu - no matter what excuses he offered, it wouldn't change her contempt for him.

With a resigned sigh, Guan Yu abandoned further attempts at justification. "What should we do now? Should we go down and question her? She might know the whereabouts of the Crystal Toad."

Xia Yue'er remained silent for a long moment before puffing her cheeks in indignation. "I never imagined you'd be such a lecher! Peeping at someone bathing wasn't enough - now you want to go down for a better look?"

Guan Yu realized further communication was impossible. Had he known this would happen, he never would have brought her along.

His suggestion to enter stemmed from two observations: First, the intricately designed pavilion clearly belonged to someone of high status within the Murong family, meaning its occupant might possess crucial information. Second, their current exposed position made discovery by searching guards inevitable.

As they debated the ethics of voyeurism, a distant shout pierced the air: "Over there!"

Several guards immediately charged towards the pavilion. Before they could react, Guan Yu and Xia Yue'er scrambled down from the rooftop to the second floor, bursting through the door without hesitation.

The bathing woman inside nearly screamed in alarm. Guan Yu swiftly sealed her pressure points as Xia Yue'er hissed coldly in her ear: "Don't make a sound. If you do, I'll let this pervert assault you!" She pointed accusingly at Guan Yu.

"Why drag me into your threats?" Guan Yu glared at her indignantly.

The terrified woman crossed her arms protectively, resembling a lamb awaiting slaughter. She nodded frantically at their every word.

Seeing her sufficiently cowed, Xia Yue'er added: "When guards come asking, claim ignorance. If you breathe a word, I'll burn this pavilion and feed you to dogs!"

Guan Yu stared in astonishment at this vicious streak. Any man marrying this vixen would risk life and limb!

Footsteps echoed below. Exchanging glances, they hid behind a curtain as knocking resounded through the pavilion.

"Who's there? Don't enter!"

"Second Young Miss, intruders were spotted entering. We request permission to search!"

"I've seen no one! I'm bathing - anyone who enters will have their eyes gouged out by Father!"

After hesitant murmurs, the guards retreated... mostly. Guan Yu signaled the woman to drive off remaining watchers.

"All of you leave immediately! Disobeying my orders?" Her sharp command finally cleared the area.

Emerging from hiding, Guan Yu averted his eyes as the woman gestured towards her clothes by the bathtub. Rustling fabric later, Xia Yue'er smacked his head. "Stop pretending! We all know you wanted to look."

Guan Yu didn't argue - any man would feel curiosity. Turning back, he saw the woman now clad in emerald gauze, damp hair cascading down her back with ethereal beauty.

Though frightened, the woman inexplicably felt safe. Instinct told her compliance would ensure harmlessness.

"I'm Guan Yu. This is my... neighbor Xia Yue'er. We mean no harm."

Xia Yue'er interjected slyly: "He wouldn't harm you - he was practically drooling during your bath!"

"Enough!" Guan Yu threatened. "Keep talking and I'll have the guards feed you to dogs!"

The woman watched their bickering with unexpected warmth. Sheltered her whole life in these mansion walls, she'd never known friendship. Though strangers, they felt oddly familiar.

"I'm Murong Li. Why are you here? How can I help?"

"We came about the Crystal Toad-" Xia Yue'er began, cut off by Guan Yu's hasty interruption: "We got lost while strolling..."

Even Guan Yu found this implausible. Murong Li mused: "The Crystal Toad? Why does everyone seek it?"

"Yes!"

She sighed. "Father, Brother, stewards, uncles... I don't understand this obsession."

Guan Yu sensed hidden meaning but knew better than to press. "Miss Murong, are your father and brother home? Have they mentioned the toad?"

"Father's here. Brother and the steward went searching, likely for the toad. They rarely speak of such matters with me."

"Do you know where they went? This is crucial!" Guan Yu's intensity startled her. "Sorry... please continue."

"Somewhere called Tiger Head Mountain, I think."

The unfamiliar地名 meant nothing to Guan Yu. "Where exactly-"

"I know!" Xia Yue'er declared. Having roamed these woods fleeing pursuers, she recognized the location. "But I'll go alone!"

After much cajoling and reluctant flattery, she relented: "Hmph! Remember your manners next time!"

As they prepared to leave, the door burst open. A white-bearded elder thundered: "Impudent thieves! You'll regret invading Murong Manor!"

Behind him stood guards exuding mid-level swordsman auras, the elder himself radiating peak advanced swordsman power.

Guan Yu laughed derisively. "You think you can stop me?"

"Foolish boasting! The entire pavilion is surrounded. There's no escape!"

Realizing their predicament, Guan Yu swiftly grabbed Murong Li, fingers resting delicately on her throat. "Let us pass, or this tender flower perishes with me!"

"You vile cur! Release her!" The elder's composure cracked.

Guan Yu mocked: "Honorable Murongs? Royal lapdogs, more like!" His taunts struck deep as he inched towards the exit, revealing silken nets glimmering with poison.

"Don't touch that!" Murong Li warned. "The Silken Array's threads are venomous. Only one safe path exists."

After tense negotiations, the elder agreed to a duel in exchange for her release. At the lakeside clearing, Guan Yu declared: "I'll face you using only magic!"

The elder, Murong Shan, brandished his meteoric iron sword. "Magic? Human practitioners are rare... but I'll crush you regardless!"

As Murong Shan lunged sword-first, Guan Yu conjured a shimmering blue blade from condensed qi. The astonished elder paused: "What sorcery is this?"

"Let's see if your steel matches my spirit blade!" Guan Yu taunted, circling his opponent. Their clash of metal and magic illuminated the night, a dance of lethal elegance where every move could mean death.
