Guan Yu couldn't help but curse through gritted teeth. With a forceful twist of his waist, he barely dodged the giant bird's strike at the critical moment. The rock behind him exploded into fragments under the creature's crushing grip.

His eyelids twitched as he watched. If this stupid bird existed in his original world, it would be considered a master combatant. Even Lin Dong might struggle against its claws unarmed. How impressive it would be to have such a creature by his side! Would that punk Lin Dong still dare bully him then?

His heart surged with excitement as he made a decision - he would tame this colossal bird as his lifelong companion.

Though it sounded like fantasy, reminiscent of Condor Heroes where he'd be Yang Guo and the bird his Divine Eagle, this wasn't impossible with his Pet System.

Previous attempts proved that subduing this creature required more than just the Pet System - physical force was necessary too. But his current condition, still recovering from injuries sustained when the bird dropped him earlier, could barely keep him from becoming roadkill under those talons.

The avian beast attacked furiously, wings creating gale-force winds that repeatedly lifted and slammed Guan Yu against rocks. Each claw strike pulverized stone, every move lethal.

Using his Detection System to predict attacks, Gravity System to evade, Healing System to mend wounds, and Pet System to attempt control, Guan Yu barely survived through the four systems' synergy. But this couldn't last - maintaining all systems drained energy rapidly, putting his life at increasing risk.

His frustration grew.

Chapter 810: Communication

Guan Yu had underestimated the beast's intelligence, trapping him in this dilemma. Escape was impossible - even with full Gravity System activation, he couldn't outrun this stubborn bird that seemed determined to make him its meal.

Suddenly, inspiration struck!

Channeling the Pet System's full power, he unleashed a powerful energy wave carrying his intent into the bird's mind: "I can cure your sick fledgling!"

The message penetrated, yet the bird's attacks continued unabated. Guan Yu barely dodged, eating dirt as talons scraped past. "Damn beast!" he cursed, continuing his desperate evasion.

The fledglings chirped excitedly, thinking their father hunted dinner. When the bird paused mid-attack, Guan Yu seized his chance - leaping onto its back while activating Healing System energy through physical contact.

After intense struggle, the giant bird finally sensed the healing energy. Its resistance waned as a connection formed through the Pet System.

"You believe me now?" Guan Yu transmitted mentally after releasing his grip.

Through broken mental images, the bird communicated its fledgling's illness. Moved by this display of parental love, Guanå®‡ abandoned his original plan to tame it, instead vowing to cure its offspring.

Chapter 811: Gao Wei's Peril

Meanwhile, Gao Wei sat tearfully at the campsite as darkness fell. Gathering firewood alone, she failed to notice the stalking wolf until its pounce. A desperate chase ensued through moonlit woods.

Just as the beast lunged for her throat, a tremendous gust of wind intervened. The starving wolf froze mid-air, suspended by an unseen force.

The moonlight revealed a colossal shadow descending - Guan Yu astride the giant Haidongqing! The raptor's talons snatched the wolf mid-leap, crushing it against a tree trunk with bone-shattering force.

Guan Yu leapt down, gravity systems cushioning his landing. "I'm here," he breathed, pulling the trembling Gao Wei into a protective embrace. Above them, Haidongqing let out a triumphant cry that echoed through the mountains.
