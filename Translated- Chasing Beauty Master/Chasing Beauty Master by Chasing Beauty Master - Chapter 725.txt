“Ah Mei, have you encountered any difficulties in coming here this time?” Guan Yu inquired.

“Guan Yu, go freshen up first and have some dinner. Ah Mei and I have already eaten. She’ll be staying here tonight. We’ll discuss matters later,” Xue Jing said, rising to prepare a fresh meal in the kitchen.

“Jingjing, don’t bother. I already ate at Lan Yu’s place.”

Xue Jing nodded and washed some fruits in the kitchen. Ah Mei sat alone on the sofa, her expression complicated, lost in thought. After Guan Yu finished washing up, he returned to the living room. Xue Jing handed him an apple. “Guan Yu, Ah Mei is facing some troubles and may need to stay here temporarily. Though this is my home, your agreement is still necessary.”

“Ah Mei wants to stay here? I don’t mind, but why?” Guan Yu found it curious. As a top celebrity, Ah Mei surely had countless places to reside. Why choose here? Was it to get closer to him? If so, she’d be mistaken—he hardly stayed home except to sleep.

“Ah Mei, whatever difficulty you’re facing, tell me. I’ll help you,” Guan Yu pressed gently, but Ah Mei seemed hesitant.

Xue Jing intervened, “Guan Yu, Ah Mei comes from a humble background. Rising in the entertainment industry hasn’t been easy. Recently, some wealthy suitors have pressured her company to coerce her into... compromising situations. She refused, but they’re leveraging their influence.”

Though unfamiliar with industry politics, Guan Yu couldn’t ignore this. “Ah Mei, stay here as long as you need. Forget fame—being ordinary isn’t so bad.”

Ah Mei burst into tears. Xue Jing, sharing a close bond with her, comforted her with an arm around her shoulders.

“By the way,” Xue Jing added, “Young Master Feng of the Feng family initially funded Ah Mei’s company. Under financial pressure, they’re forcing her to...”

Guan Yu nodded coldly. “This Feng brat needs to be taught a lesson.”

With Ah Mei’s concert approaching, Guan Yu reassured her, “Proceed with the performance. Afterward, stay here. I’ll ensure no one harms you.”

The next noon, Guan Yu wandered toward the cafeteria and encountered Liu Shuowei. “Guan Yu, I heard you joined the taekwondo tournament. With you, our school might finally win. Personal glory awaits—give it your all!”

Guan Yu shrugged off the praise. He cared little for accolades; his goal was to spar with A City’s top fighters.

Lu Mei trailed behind him. “Guan Yu, tomorrow’s Saturday. Let’s attend Ah Mei’s concert together?” He agreed readily—he wouldn’t miss it.

After dozing through afternoon classes, Wei Hongwei approached. “Brother Guan! Any updates on finding me a girlfriend?”

“It’s only been a day! Be patient.”

“I just wanted to treat you and the goddesses to dinner as thanks!”

Guan Yu glanced at Lu Mei. “I’m free. If she agrees, we’ll go. Otherwise, I’ll invite the others waiting at home.”

Lu Mei, suspecting the “others” were female, interjected, “I’ll come! Free food? Why not!”

“Great! I’ll make arrangements,” Wei Hongwei said, darting off.

That evening, Guan Yu arrived at Mike’s Bar with Lu Mei, Xue Jing, and Ah Mei. Wei Hongwei waited impatiently at the entrance. “Brother Guan! You’re late!”

The Second Boss, honoring Guan Yu, ushered them to a VIP room. On the fourth floor, they collided with Young Master Feng, whose eyes gleamed at Ah Mei.

“Our star! Here for me? How flattering! And the campus belle too!” Feng leered, blocking their path.

“Move, mutt,” Guan Yu snapped. Ah Mei cowered behind Xue Jing as Wei Hongwei groaned, “Can’t we just eat in peace?”

The Second Boss hesitated, torn between his admiration for Guan Yu and the Feng family’s influence.

“Second Boss! Throw this dog out—but keep the ladies,” Feng ordered.

“Do it, or are you rebelling?”

“No need for trouble. We’ll leave,” Guan Yu said, steering the group downstairs.

“Stop! You think you can waltz out?” Feng bellowed. Dozens of armed thugs swarmed the stairwell, trapping them.

As chaos erupted, the lights cut out. Guan Yu seized the darkness, disarming two guards and tossing a pistol to Wei Hongwei. “Everyone, hold hands and stay behind me!”

Battling through the crowd, they fought their way to the exit. Ah Mei sobbed uncontrollably, clinging to Xue Jing.

“Xue Jing, take Ah Mei and Lu Mei home!” Guan Yu ordered.

“Come with us... I’m scared for you,” Ah Mei pleaded between tears.

“I’ll be fine. Go.”

Once the women left, Guan Yu turned to Wei Hongwei. “You should go too.”

“I’m staying. I won’t abandon a friend.”

Guan Yu handed him the gun. “Shoot anyone who gets close.”

Outside, Feng screamed, “After them! Bring Ah Mei back!”

Wei Hongwei shot out a car tire, earning Guan Yu’s grin.

“Wei Hongwei! Defy me, and your family suffers!” Feng threatened from behind his guards.

Guan Yu strode forward, blade flashing to Feng’s throat. “Any last words, Young Master Feng?”

“Y-You’ll regret this! The Fengs will destroy you!”

“The Fengs are nothing to me. Hear this—Ah Mei is under my protection. Cross her again, and tomorrow’s sun won’t rise for you.”

Feng trembled, his bravado crumbling. “I-I’ll stop! I swear!”

“A Feng heir, cowering? How novel.” Guan Yu pressed the blade, drawing a whimper. “Consider this your final warning.”

***

As Feng’s men charged, Guan Yu became a whirlwind—kicking, punching, disarming. Wei Hongwei watched in awe as bodies flew.

Within minutes, half the attackers lay defeated. Guan Yu vanished, reappearing behind Feng with a blade at his neck.

“P-Please! I’ll never touch her again!”

“Remember this fear,” Guan Yu hissed. “Now crawl back to your family—if they still want you.”

He sheathed the blade, leaving Feng shaking in the gutter. Victory secured, Guan Yu strode away, Wei Hongwei trailing in stunned admiration.
