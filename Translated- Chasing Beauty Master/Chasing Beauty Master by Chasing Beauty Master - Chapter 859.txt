The sisters beside her jostled and clamored to get a look at the bracelet, their envy palpable. Finally, Qu Meimei regained her composure, though a trace of disappointment surfaced as she said, "No, Brother Guan. While I deeply appreciate your kindness, this bracelet must be extraordinarily valuable. I can't accept something so precious. Please take it back."

Qu Meimei's manners were impeccable. Though she longed to keep the gift, she knew accepting such extravagance would create an irredeemable debt. Despite her ardent desire, she resolved to return it.

Guan Yu observed her with newfound admiration, marveling that this village girl understood restraint and propriety. "Once given, a gift shouldn't be reclaimed," he chuckled. "Besides, this trifle means nothing to my coffers."

"Absolutely not! This is far too valuable!" Meimei insisted, the velvet box trembling in her work-roughened hands. Even through the satin lining, the gold's weight spoke of unimaginable wealth—perhaps more money than she'd seen in her entire nineteen years.

Though aware of Guan Yu's wealth, Meimei remained resolute. Their lack of personal ties made accepting such luxury unthinkable. The surrounding sisters exchanged meaningful glances—some mentally cursing her foolishness for rejecting fortunes that could be sold, others greedily imagining the bracelet adorning their own wrists.

**Chapter 2217: The Priceless Gift**

Trapped by etiquette, Guan Yu sought Ling'er's aid with a pleading glance. The silver-haired girl understood—while the bracelet's price would give even her pause (costing nearly half her monthly earnings), preserving Guan Yu's pride outweighed financial considerations.

"Sister Meimei," Ling'er coaxed, "accept Brother Guan's blessing. Tomorrow you'll be the first bride in village history wed wearing such splendor!"

"But Sister Ling'er! This is too—"

"Brother Guan spends more on tailcoats," Ling'er interjected. All eyes suddenly scrutinized Guan Yu's seemingly ordinary suit. A nearby farmer edged away nervously, terrified of brushing against fabric allegedly worth kingdoms.

Guan Yu suppressed a sigh—his attire was expensive, but not mythical. "Consider it borrowed then," he proposed. "Wear it for your wedding procession in my million-yuan car, then return it afterward."

As the sisters chorused agreement, Meimei finally relented. "Only for tomorrow," she whispered, fastening the bracelet. Golden links cascaded over her sun-darkened wrist, the concealed forearm revealing startling alabaster skin untouched by fields. The sisters' envious gasps harmonized with Ling'er's satisfied nod—Guan Yu had already resolved the "borrowed" bracelet would become permanent after the ceremony.

**Chapter 2218: The Pain Unseen**

Attention shifted when Guan Yu noticed Auntie's limping gait. "Does neuralgia plague your leg?" he asked, observing her atrophied left limb. "Worse when bearing weight? Like hot wires shooting to your skull?"

"You describe it perfectly!" The woman nodded, her forty-year-old face etched with sixty-year-old weariness. Years of futile treatments and financial strain had resigned her to agony.

As Guan Yu diagnosed sciatica, Ling'er implored, "Please help her!" The young master nodded, recalling how his inner qi had alleviated similar conditions. "This will hurt terribly," he warned.

"What's pain to these old bones?" Auntie smiled, biting down on a towel as Guan Yu began. Spirits soaked her knee before his hands blurred into golden afterimages, channeling healing energy. The room held its breath as she trembled—a weathered oak enduring storm winds.

**Chapter 2219: Beyond Limits**

When Guan Yu finally ceased, Ling'er dabbed his glistening brow while Meimei hovered anxiously. "Let her rest," he instructed, observing Auntie's drained but peaceful expression. Though full recovery would take years, the worst spasms had been quelled.

As the healed woman drowsed, Guan Yu's gaze swept the humble cottage. Tomorrow's golden procession would spark village legends, but tonight's quiet victory over pain mattered more. He caught Ling'er's approving smile—together, they'd woven miracles into this rustic tapestry.
