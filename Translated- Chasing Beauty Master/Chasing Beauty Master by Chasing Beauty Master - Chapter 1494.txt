“Because I didn’t dare go. I’ve never saved this much money before, and in our town, everyone knows each other’s circumstances. If I suddenly walked into a bank with such a large gold leaf, they’d surely think I stole it and report me to the authorities.”

“Ah, I see. That makes sense. I overlooked that aspect. How about this—tomorrow I’ll take you to deposit the money. But for now, put that gold leaf away. There’s no way we’ll let you pay,” Guan Yu said.

Wang Jun pointed at Guan Yu. “It’s all your fault! Why do you always hesitate over trivial amounts of silver? Look—you’ve upset Liu Yun with your dithering.”

“We were just joking. Who knew she’d take it seriously?” Guan Yu grumbled.

“You have the nerve to say that! When I went to the Mo Soul Sect’s outpost today to get the signal flare, they extorted two whole gold leaves from me before handing it over. And I haven’t even asked you to reimburse me yet! Count yourself lucky,” Wang Jun retorted, shoving a piece of meat into his mouth with exaggerated force.

Guan Yu exclaimed, “That’s outrageous! Two gold leaves? You’re not inflating the cost to squeeze extra from me, are you?”

“Hmph! I couldn’t care less about such petty sums. Why would I lie? If you don’t believe me, I’ll take you there tomorrow. That shrewd old man insisted he wouldn’t budge without the Hall Master’s token.”

“Please stop arguing. Just use mine,” Liu Yun interjected.

Guan Yu immediately fell silent. Wang Jun chuckled, “Don’t misunderstand, Liu Yun. We were just teasing each other. Guan Yu has plenty of gold—of course we wouldn’t use yours.”

“Exactly! Please put it away, Liu Yun. You’re making us feel awkward,” Guan Yu added.

**Chapter 3,894: Fine Tea, Bitter Taste**

Though the saying goes “wealth should not be flaunted,” Guan Yu sighed and produced a large money pouch from his robes. Placing it on the table, he revealed rows of neatly stacked gold leaves glinting within.

“Wow! So much gold!” Xiao Yuan gasped, forgetting her meal entirely.

“See this, Liu Yun? Do I look like someone short on funds? We were truly just jesting earlier. Please don’t take it to heart. Put your gold leaf away—I’ll take you to the bank tomorrow,” Guan Yu insisted.

Upon seeing Guan Yu’s wealth, Liu Yun finally understood their earlier banter hadn’t been about genuine financial strain.

Guan Yu turned to Wang Jun. “Did the Mo Soul Sect outpost mention when the letter would arrive?”

“About that—” Wang Jun paused to swallow a mouthful of vegetables. “Their efficiency is remarkable. While we rely on horseback or carrier pigeons for messages, the Mo Soul Sect uses cultivators trained in flight techniques. What takes us days, they accomplish in mere hours. I’d estimated two days for the message to reach them, but they claimed it would arrive by nightfall. Impressive, no?”

“Incredible!” Guan Yu marveled. “Covering such distance in half a day requires extraordinary flying stamina and spiritual energy reserves. The Mo Soul Sect’s might is undeniable.”

He reflected on the contrast with his own Yunqing Sect’s slower methods. This disparity in information networks, he realized, was key to the Mo Soul Sect’s dominance.

After dinner, as Guan Yu prepared for a stroll, Wang Jun cautioned, “One of us should stay to guard Liu Yun and her daughter.”

“By your estimate, Wang Xiaorong should have received my letter by now. The Mo Soul Sect’s envoys may already be en route?”

“Presumably, barring complications. If you’re staying, I’ll take that walk—I’ve slept enough this afternoon.”

Xiao Yuan piped up, “I want to go too! It’s so lively outside!”

“No! Come here—it’s time to wash up for bed,” Liu Yun firmly redirected her daughter.

Though tempted to indulge the child, Wang Jun reconsidered—losing someone else’s daughter in this bustling city would be disastrous.

Guan Yu, weary from travel, opted to retire early. “Go if you must, but be cautious. This city teems with merchants and unsavory types.”

“Don’t fret—I’ll avoid trouble unless provoked,” Wang Jun assured, already halfway out.

Remembering the Mo Soul Sect’s teahouse across the street, Wang Jun headed there. Mid-crossing, galloping hooves suddenly thundered behind him.

“Make way! Runaway horse!” a voice shouted.

Wang Jun lunged sideways as the beast thundered past, close enough to ruffle his robes. The near-miss left him shaken—at that speed, collision would have been fatal.

Curses erupted from shaken pedestrians: “Blind fool! Trying to kill someone?!” “Damn rider! Ought to be flogged!”

Shaking his head at the chaos, Wang Jun entered the teahouse where the waiter recognized him immediately. “Honored guest! More business?”

“Just tea today. Your finest blend, please.”

As an aficionado since childhood, Wang Jun missed proper tea. The local variants’ sour undertones—reminiscent of pickled cabbage—displeased his palate.

The waiter hesitated. “Our tea comes directly from the Imperial supplier—His Majesty’s own stock. Let me bring a pot for your judgment.”

To Wang Jun’s surprise, the brew proved exquisite—fragrant and mellow without acidity. “This is splendid! What’s it called?”

“Dà Hóng Páo—the Emperor’s favorite. Authentic batches are rare, often counterfeited. Ours is processed by palace artisans.”

Wang Jun’s eyes lit up. “Could I purchase some?”

The waiter demurred. “Our reserves are scant, reserved for distinguished guests. Forgive me, Honored Incense Master.”

Wang Jun sighed—another dead end. Changing tack, he inquired about the letter’s delivery timeline.

“By now, the reply should—” The waiter abruptly excused himself, spotting two approaching figures.

Wang Jun’s breath caught—Wang Xiaorong and the Left Envoy approached. As he rose to leave, the Left Envoy beckoned. Resigned, Wang Jun approached his handler, mind racing about impending complications.
