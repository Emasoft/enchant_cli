“Actually, surveillance footage can’t be casually shown to others. But since you’re a detective, I’ll make an exception. This way, please.” The manager led Guanyu to a small adjacent room.

The cramped space contained only a desk with two computers and monitoring equipment. Two monitors displayed a nine-grid view of the restaurant downstairs.

“Please wait a moment. Do you need to review the entire surveillance footage from last night?” asked Yuewei.

Guanyu pondered, then replied, “Let’s start from midnight onward. I came here last night hoping to uncover clues but found nothing. Now I want to check the footage for leads.”

“Ah, I see. This is the complete footage from midnight onward. Take a look.” Yuewei, remarkably accommodating, began playing the recording as Guanyu approached.

The screen replayed the footage starting at midnight. Guanyu saw himself entering with Feng Xihu and sitting in a quiet corner. Six guests—three men and three women, seemingly three couples—occupied different tables.

Manager Yuewei glanced between Guanyu on the screen, the woman beside him, and Jinhua in the room. After alternating glances twice, he grinned and gave Guanyu a thumbs-up. “Great taste.”

Guanyu sighed inwardly. Jinhua already harbored strong prejudices against Feng Xihu, and Yuewei’s remark—transparent to anyone—only exacerbated tensions. The manager’s implication was clear: Guanyu had enviable luck, accompanying different beauties day and night.

Guanyu knew Jinhua’s expression must be thunderous. He forced a smile, refusing to glance back at her. Focusing on the footage seemed wiser—provoking her stubborn temper now risked disaster. Yet he couldn’t escape entirely. Jinhua’s small hand stealthily pinched his waist viciously. Gritting his teeth against the pain, he remained silent, hoping this would placate her.

The surveillance showed Guanyu and Feng Xihu seated in a corner visible only through one camera. A male waiter approached, smiling as he spoke to Guanyu while leering blatantly at Feng Xihu’s neckline.

“How long has this waiter worked here?” Guanyu inquired.

“Hmm, I’m not certain. I handle logistics and finances. You’d need to ask the HR manager,” Yuewei replied.

“Such a small establishment, yet so many managers,” Jinhua remarked.

Yuewei chuckled. “We’re a chain store. With many part-timers and tasks, the owner spares no expense hiring managers.”

Guanyu nodded, eyes fixed on the footage. The recording showed him conversing with Feng Xihu at length while the waiter lurked in another corner, staring obsessively at her.

One camera captured Guanyu and Feng Xihu, another the passageway to the kitchen where the waiter idly played with his phone, repeatedly glancing at Feng Xihu and licking his lips impatiently. As the night deepened, customers dwindled until only Guanyu and Feng Xihu remained.

Suddenly, Feng Xihu attempted to stand but collapsed back into her seat. Simultaneously, the waiter grinned triumphantly and approached. Guanyu also appeared unsteady.

When the waiter tried carrying Feng Xihu away, Guanyu intervened. In the ensuing struggle, the waiter drew a pistol, only for Guanyu to sever his fingers with a lightning-fast dagger strike.

Yuewei stared at Guanyu, astonished by his blade’s speed. At such close range, even he couldn’t have dodged that strike—mercifully aimed at fingers instead of the throat.

Post-departure footage showed the wounded waiter suddenly rising and fleeing. Exterior cameras captured him vanishing swiftly. Shortly after, police arrived, found only bloodstains, and sealed the restaurant.

“When I arrived this morning, police had already cordoned it off,” Yuewei explained. “They withdrew after I persuaded them no one was injured or reported missing. We cleaned the blood and resumed business.”

“Where’s the HR manager? I need information on that waiter,” Guanyu pressed.

Yuewei, assuming Guanyu sought retribution, replied indifferently, “The HR manager is out. He’ll return shortly. Perhaps wait?”

Seeing no reason to protect a mere waiter—especially against someone of Guanyu’s lethal skills—Yuewei suggested, “Let’s wait in my office with tea.”

En route, Guanyu remarked, “That waiter wasn’t inexperienced. His calmness suggests habitual drugging.”

“Likely targeting women repeatedly,” Jinhua added.

“Speculation aside,” Yuewei said, “if he returns, I’ll alert police. But I doubt he will.”

In the office, Yuewei served tea. As Guanyu raised his cup, the door opened.

“Dake, you’re back early! These guests have questions,” Yuewei greeted.

The newcomer—Dake, a thirty-something Westerner—exuded arrogance. Guanyu stood politely. “We’re seeking information on this person.” He displayed the waiter’s photo on his phone.

Dake barely glanced, sneering, “Leave it on my desk. I’m busy.”

Guanyu inwardly cursed. *What’s his problem? Acting like I owe him money. Did his family die?*

**Chapter 2,339: The Arrogant Man (Part 2)**

Dake’s dismissiveness irritated Jinhua. His head-to-toe beige ensemble and haughty demeanor screamed for a punch. Yet Yuewei seemed accustomed, explaining, “They’re inquiring about last night’s waiter. Share his records.”

“Impossible!” Dake snapped, settling at his desk. “Employee files are confidential. Even police require warrants. Releasing them would violate privacy laws.”

Guanyu clenched his fists, resisting the urge to knock Dake’s teeth out. Forcing calm, he said, “We merely wish to contact him regarding an unrelated matter. A phone number suffices.”

Dake lit a cigarette, blowing smoke rings. “No. Return during his shift if you want him.”

Yuewei interjected, “That waiter drugged a guest last night. He won’t return.”

“Drugged?” Dake finally noticed Jinhua, leering unabashedly. “My staff wouldn’t do that. You’re mistaken.”

“The footage proves otherwise,” Yuewei countered.

“You showed them surveillance?!” Dake glared. “That’s confidential!”

“There was nothing sensitive. Mr. Guanyu’s a detective investigating a case,” Yuewei defended.

Dake’s eyes narrowed. “Detective? Did footage show actual drugging? No? Then it’s circumstantial.”

Guanyu sensed collusion. Adopting diplomacy, he said, “The footage reveals little. I simply wish to ask him about someone else.”

Jinhua stepped forward. “Mr. Dake, stop ogling me.”

Caught off-guard, Dake smirked. “Can’t blame a man for appreciating beauty. Stay home if you dislike attention.”

**Chapter 2,340: The Arrogant Man (Part 3)**

“You’ve obstructed us repeatedly,” Jinhua accused. “What’s your relationship with that waiter?”

“I relate to all staff. Must I justify that?” Dake retorted.

“We only seek to question him,” Jinhua pressed. “Why hinder us?”

Dake scoffed. “I’m not hindering. Contact him yourself on his time. I won’t assist.”
