“It wasn’t the fear of a lawsuit—he dreaded the combined scandal of this incident and the leaked recording. If both went public, his reputation would be utterly ruined!

‘Damn… You think money solves everything? I’ll give you 500,000. Let me kill you once, how about that?’ Gritting his teeth, Guan Yu stepped forward to confront Piao Xu again, but Gao Wei pulled him back.

‘Guan Yu… I—I want to leave here. Take me away,’ Gao Wei pleaded, her dark eyes glistening with tears, pure and pleading like a spring pond as she gazed at him.

Guan Yu’s face twisted in disbelief. ‘So we’re just letting this fucking slide?’

Gao Wei bit her lip, silent under his stare.

‘Fuck… Fine! I shouldn’t have stuck my nose in! My fucking mistake—this is sickening!’ With a snarl, Guan Yu shook off Gao Wei’s grip and motioned for Niu Le to leave.

Panicked, Gao Wei lunged forward, clutching Guan Yu’s arm from behind. ‘Don’t be angry… I—I need time to think. Leaving me alone… I’m scared!’ Her voice broke into muffled sobs.

Goddamn women’s tears—he couldn’t handle them. Reluctantly, Guan Yu halted, tilted his head upward with a sigh, then turned and dragged Gao Wei out by the arm.

The corridor fell silent. Crew members gaped as Guan Yu stormed off with Gao Wei in tow.

Back in the car, Guan Yu took the keys from the dazed Gao Wei, not trusting her to drive. Clutching his sleeve, she sat pale and trembling in the passenger seat.

‘It’s over. Where to?’ Guan Yu softened his tone.

‘Somewhere quiet. I need to calm down,’ she murmured, glancing at him.

After dropping Niu Le at the college, Guan Yu drove Gao Wei to Mochou Lake. The serene green waters and willow trees offered little comfort. Huddled in the car, she remained visibly shaken.

Silence lingered. Guan Yu fumbled for words—how does one soothe someone who’d brushed shoulders with death?

‘Thank you… Guan Yu. I’m lucky to have a friend like you,’ Gao Wei said earnestly, her large eyes sincere.

‘Just a hunch,’ Guan Yu shrugged, though his certainty had come from his investigative skills.

Gao Wei bit her lip. ‘I never thought that bastard… that monster would try to kill me.’

‘Why? Wasn’t he your admirer? A suitor?’ Guan Yu lit a cigarette, eyeing her curiously.

‘Uh… Mind if I smoke?’

She shook her head shyly. ‘Go ahead.’

Calmer now, Gao Wei played a recording from her phone.

‘Holy shit—this asshole’s vile! All because you saw through his scheme and he couldn’t…’ Guan Yu trailed off, censoring his cruder thoughts.

Gao Wei shot him a reproachful glance.

‘The bastard’s ruthless! Scheming, threatening—no better than a rapist! I’d never sink to that. Mutual desire’s what matters—passion, harmony…’

Blushing, Gao Wei coughed. ‘Stop… that’s embarrassing.’

Embarrassed? Guan Yu smirked. Girls and their delicate sensibilities.

Stealing a glance, Gao Wei whispered, ‘I almost died because of him. Thank you… I’ll repay you.’

‘Repay?’ He grinned, eyeing her. ‘Planning to offer yourself, sister?’

Gao Wei stifled a laugh, glaring. ‘In your dreams! You’ve got Xiaojuan. Want to two-time?’

Guan Yu scratched his head. ‘Could work…’

‘What?!’ She spun toward him, wide-eyed.

Shit—spoken aloud. Guan Yu winced inwardly.

**Chapter 349: Murder!**

Truth was, he already balanced more than two relationships. Adding Gao Wei? Why not—though he’d never admit it.

‘I mean… For anyone else, I’d never consider it. But you’re a superstar—a celestial beauty. What man could resist? If you’re willing, my resolve’s paper-thin.’

‘Smooth-talker,’ Gao Wei muttered, flushing. Despite his teasing, the compliment pleased her.

‘How’s Xiaojuan?’ she asked, changing topics.

‘Same as ever.’

‘She’s a good girl—pure, guileless. Treat her well.’

Guan Yu shrugged silently. His tangled love life loomed like a storm.

Unaware, Gao Wei pushed aside her own wistfulness, discussing Piao Xu. ‘I’ll tell the company everything. I’m quitting this project.’

Guan Yu nodded. Behind the glamour, stars faced horrors—who’d imagine a top singer nearly murdered on set?

‘Let me treat you to dinner,’ she offered softly.

‘No need. I’d help anyone.’

After repeated refusals, Gao Wei punched his shoulder. ‘Stop acting noble! Do I have to beg?’

Smirking, Guan Yu leaned closer. ‘Gratitude doesn’t require food. I’d prefer you offering yourself.’

‘You’ve got Xiaojuan! Don’t tease… I might take it seriously.’ She turned away, hiding her face.

Wait—was she serious? Guan Yu wiped imaginary sweat. A star like her? Out of his league.

Driving through Nanjing, they settled on an elegant hotel. With sunglasses and a knitted cap, Gao Wei’s porcelain beauty still turned heads.

November’s chill hit as they exited the car. In a private room, conversation flowed—until Guan Yu’s phone rang.

‘Shi Lei? What’s wrong?’

‘Guan Yu! I got you that internship, and you beat up the male lead? Niu Le’s been arrested—get back here!’

Stunned, Guan Yu stood. ‘On my way.’

‘What happened?’ Gao Wei asked.

‘They arrested Niu Le. They struck first.’

Her eyes widened. ‘I didn’t know—’

‘Not blaming you. Let’s go.’

At the college, Liu Shilei pulled him aside. ‘When will you stop causing trouble?!’

‘I’ll handle it,’ Guan Yu promised, embracing her.

‘Tell me the truth!’ she pleaded tearfully.

‘Niu Le’s in jail. It’s… a homicide.’

**Chapter 350: Will They Get Sentenced?**

A body—Piao Xu’s bodyguard, dead from Niu Le’s stab wound.

‘I’m sorry… This is all my fault!’ Gao Wei trembled.

‘Not your fault.’ Guan Yu’s mind raced. Self-defense? Manslaughter?

Liu Shilei clung to him. ‘Promise you’ll stay with me!’

‘I promise.’

As they parted, Gao Wei arrived, witnessing their embrace. Confusion flickered—wasn’t he with Xiaojuan?

To the police station they went, the weight of murder charges hanging heavy.
