Elder Griffin swept his gaze across the crowd, noting all heads bowed low. Shaking his head with an inaudible sigh, he remarked, "In former days, these people would've scrambled to raise their hands. Since discovering Guanyu's true capabilities, their arrogance has withered like frostbitten weeds!"

The assembly hall thrummed with unspoken tension. Those who'd once mocked Guanyu now found their jeers strangled in their throats – the ninth-tier magic aptitude test results had erected an insurmountable wall between their mediocrity and his brilliance.

Guanyu stood motionless, a faint smile playing on his lips as his gaze swept the arena. Wherever his eyes lingered, disciples flinched and averted their stares like nocturnal creatures shrinking from dawn's first light. The irony hung thicker than morning fog in the training grounds.

From this sea of cowed faces emerged Hu Xiaohai, his resentment bubbling like molten lava. The disciple who'd once deemed Guanyu beneath contempt now trembled with barely contained fury. "Cowards!" he spat at his peers. "You quake like autumn leaves, but I'll pluck that upstart's wings mid-flight!"

As Hu surged to his feet, Wu Yuying's hand clamped on his arm like an iron manacle. "Rashness serves no master," she warned, eyes narrowed. "The worm has transformed – strike blindly and you'll grasp only air."

Hu wrenched free, his glare shifting to Huo Lingling in the stands. "He steals my destined bride! Claims honors that should crown my brow! Shall I swallow these insults like bitter herbs?" Spittle flew as he thumped his chest. "Let the heavens witness – though his talent outshines mine, I've honed my craft through four seasons' turning. What's raw potential against tempered steel?"

Seeing resolve harden in Hu's features, Wu produced a milky pill from her robes. "The Huang-rank Giant Demon Pill," she murmured. "It'll boost your cultivation two tiers... for two moons' stagnation thereafter. Use only when death stares back."

Hu snatched the pill with gleeful avarice. "Now we'll see what tricks remain in that pauper's sleeve!" he crowed. "I'll knock his teeth out before the entire sect – let Huo Lingling watch her hero grovel!"

Wu's voice turned urgent. "Bruise his flesh, but spare his life! The Sect Master's wrath..."

Her words dissolved in the wind as Hu stormed the arena platform. "Guanyu!" he bellowed, veins throbbing at his temples. "Come taste true cultivation!"

The assembly's collective breath hitched. Hundreds of eyes tracked Hu's advance – some gleaming with schadenfreude, others clouded by dread. Elder Griffin observed without enthusiasm, knowing Hu's vaunted skills might prove as flimsy as rice paper against Guanyu's transformed aura.

"State your terms," the elder intoned, positioning himself between the rivals. "Both are sect treasures. Any lethal strikes will incur my severest displeasure."

Guanyu's lips twitched. "Accepted."

As the elder withdrew, Sect Master Huo Zhengtian watched from the high dais, fingers tightening imperceptibly on his armrest. Though Guanyu's current frailty remained hidden, the sect leader's mind churned like storm-tossed seas. Could raw talent overcome honed technique? Could the phoenix rise from apparent ashes?

Hu's qi erupted in a sulfurous haze, fists crackling with obsidian lightning. "Die, usurper!" he roared, launching into the Heavenly Spirit Fist technique – a blur of clawed strikes aiming for Guanyu's throat.

The crowd gasped as Guanyu stood impassive... until the final heartbeat. A dancer's sidestep, a palm's gentle push. Hu careened past like a drunkard, boots screeching across stone. Before he could pivot, Guanyu materialized behind him – a phantom made flesh – and delivered a kick that sent Hu sprawling face-first before the assembly.

"Continue?" Guanyu inquired mildly, looming over his coughing rival.

From the dais, Liu Piaopiao sipped her tea with a satisfied smile. "Our young phoenix requires no coddling," she murmured to the Sect Master, watching Guanyu's qi swirl like gilded mist around his hands.

Hu surged up, face purpling. "What dark art is this?!"

Silence answered him. With bestial roar, Hu charged again – only to meet empty air as Guanyu dissolved into afterimages. The sharp crack of foot meeting posterior echoed through the arena. Hu skidded across the platform, coming to rest at Elder Griffin's feet like a broken puppet.

Gasps rippled through disciples and elders alike. The once-mocked youth stood serene, not a hair out of place. Hu's labored breaths and disheveled robes screamed louder than any victory proclamation.

When Hu's choking coughs subsided, Guanyu extended a hand – not in aid, but challenge. "Well?"

The crowd erupted. Whispers of "Nascent Soul mastery" and "veiled techniques" buzzed like angry hornets. Elder Griffin's lips twitched toward approval despite himself. Even Sect Master Huo leaned forward, years of worry lines smoothing momentarily.

**Chapter 1510: Gains in the Marketplace**

Later, in the northern market district's bustling lanes, Guanyu navigated merchant stalls with feline grace. The Bisque Cat's voice buzzed in his mind: *Third stall left – that mildewed scroll reeks of ancient secrets.*

Feigning interest in monster cores, Guanyu's peripheral vision studied the artifact. Its cracked surface bore fungal blooms resembling celestial constellations. "Four hundred gold for this wolf core?" he haggled automatically, senses focused on the scroll's faint qi resonance.

The vendor launched into practiced theatrics: "Good sir! My comrades bled for this first-tier timber wolf core! Why, just last—"

Guanyu's fingers brushed the scroll's edge. Energy prickled up his arm like liquid lightning. Maintaining nonchalance, he tossed a coin pouch. "Wrap them both. My alchemy master enjoys... curiosities."

As he departed, market guards nodded respectfully. "Young Master Guanyu! Your father—"

"—would approve of prudent investments," Guanyu finished with a disarming smile. The scroll burned against his chest, its secrets whispering promises of power yet unclaimed.
