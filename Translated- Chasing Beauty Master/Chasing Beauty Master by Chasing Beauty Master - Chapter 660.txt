After entering the Demon Realm, Guan Yu came to understand that the cosmos contained countless worlds. As martial artists continuously elevated their cultivation, they ought to ascend to higher planes of existence. His return to the mortal world this time was merely to settle affairs he deemed necessary, after which he planned to take his beloved and venture back into the challenging, boundless realms of the Demon Realm where greater opportunities awaited.

This perspective granted Guan Yu a transcendent composure unattainable to others when confronting worldly matters. Hearing the artificially gruff voice behind him now, he found amusement rather than anger.

With a resigned shrug at Hou Jinshun, Guan Yu turned slowly to face a brawny youth over 1.9 meters tall. The young man wore oversized sportswear, his sagging shorts nearly brushing the floor. A mop of permed blond hair was tied into a topknot, gold rings pierced his nostrils, and each earlobe bore four studded piercings. His right hand curled inward, middle and ring fingers tucked while the remaining three jutted rigidly toward Guan Yu’s head, a gaudy gold ring adorning his index finger.

*Damn it,* Guan Yu cursed inwardly. *You abandon our glorious Chinese heritage to mimic black hip-hop culture? I was inclined to spare you, but now I’ll have to teach you the lesson your parents failed to.*

Behind the hip-hop youth lurked two hulking bodyguards in stereotypical black suits. Such lackeys typically possessed middling skills—formidable against ordinary folk but far from true masters. Yet Guan Yu sensed these two were pseudo-supernaturals, hinting at their employer’s significant background.

Yang Lin, who had initially sat down, rushed over upon recognizing the troublemaker. “Brother Hu,” he addressed the hip-hop youth, “this is my boss Guan Yu, newly transferred to our class.”

Guan Yu pulled Yang Lin aside. “Go finish your meal. This doesn’t concern you.” Knowing Yang Lin had followed Wang Jun due to familial obligations, he wanted to prevent further entanglement.

Yang Lin whispered urgently, “That’s Meng Fancheng, son of Black Dragon Society’s leader Meng Jingang. Be careful.”

Guan Yu waved him off, unfazed by gang affiliations. Turning to Xu Ying, he teased, “You’re quite popular! First Wang Jun claims you’re his woman, now this oaf appears. How many suitors do you have?”

Xu Ying glared. “I don’t *have* any! These idiots pursue me on their own! Stupid Meng Fancheng—when did I ever encourage him? Get lost and let us eat!”

Despite his earlier bluster, Meng Fancheng softened like melted wax before Xu Ying. “Yingying,” he cooed, “our fathers agreed we should date. How can you dine with another guy? Don’t you know this breaks my heart?”

Guan Yu nearly choked. This thug’s saccharine tone revealed genuine affection, amplified by their families’ apparent connection.

As Meng Fancheng prattled on, Xu Ying suddenly stamped her foot. “You’re ruining my meal! I’m leaving—enjoy making a fool of yourself!” She stormed out, leaving Meng Fancheng fuming.

The gang heir chased after her briefly before returning, wrath redirected at Guan Yu. “Bastard! I held back earlier for Yingying’s sake, but now…” He slammed the table, his gold ring glinting as he swung a fist.

Guan Yu sipped tea, unperturbed. Hou Jinshun, buzzing with newfound spiritual energy, intercepted the blow. His hand clamped Meng’s fist like an iron vise, bone-crunching cracks eliciting a howl.

**Chapter 1677: A Minor Display of Prowess**

Hou Jinshun’s barroom past had imprinted his slovenly attire and mannerisms. His floral shirt, tacky tattoos, and sleazy grin had misled Meng’s group into dismissing him as a lowly punk—until he moved.

The bodyguards drew daggers, stabbing at Hou’s back. He dropped, shattering his chair as blades embedded in the table. Meng’s mangled hand—now a gnarled claw—left the guards aghast. Their boss’s basketball aspirations were pulp.

“Damn, I’m strong!” Hou marveled as Guan Yu chuckled. The Righteous Qi Art he’d taught Hou radiated unyielding vigor, its potency evident even in infancy.

A guard brandished his blade. “Fool! You’ve maimed the Black Dragon heir! Cripple yourself now or die!”

Meng screeched, “Kill them both!”

**Chapter 1678: The Pretty-Boy**

Police sirens interrupted as officers surrounded the restaurant. A young female cop stormed in, pistol trained on the bodyguards. “Drop your weapons!”

“*We’re* the victims!” Meng spat through pain. “Arrest them, or my father will bury your career!”

Ignoring his threats, Officer Wang sneered, “Black Dragon thugs playing victims? I see armed goons versus unarmed civilians. Drop the knives—now!”

A veteran colleague cautioned, “Wait for backup! These are Black Dragon pseudo-supernaturals…”

Meng leered at Wang. “Newbie, huh? I’ll enjoy breaking you in.”

Unfazed, Wang declared, “I’m your worst nightmare! Today marks the end of your—*urk*!”

The guards lunged, daggers flashing. Guan Yu watched, intrigued, as the rookie cop—a self-styled “heroine”—revealed surprising grit.
