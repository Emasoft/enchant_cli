“Who would have thought such a method would indeed work?” Hearing this, Wang Xiaorong also stopped and turned to stride over. “Yes, Guan Yu, hurry up and continue! What happened next?”

Seeing the two instantly quiet down, Guan Yu shook his head helplessly and continued, “At the banquet hosted by the emperor for the Top Scholar, the handsome scholar displayed his talents—reciting poetry and showcasing his gifts. Every noble maiden present was captivated by him. One could say he became the ideal husband in the eyes of all the young ladies there.

“Yet despite this, Zhu’er remained unworried. Even when the Top Scholar mingled with other maidens, she felt no jealousy, for she knew her bond with Gan Lu was ordained by Buddha. She believed they were destined to be together.”

“Wow, that Top Scholar must have been so exceptional—the type every girl in the world would adore…” Qiqi’s words trailed off as she sensed a murderous aura beside her. Glancing at Wang Xiaorong’s glare, she stuck out her tongue apologetically. “Sorry, I spoke out of turn again. I’ll cover my mouth.”

This was typical of Qiqi—always interjecting during others’ conversations, often unable to resist voicing her thoughts, thus repeatedly interrupting Guan Yu’s storytelling.

But Qiqi reacted swiftly. Sensing Wang Xiaorong’s dagger-like gaze, she promptly fell silent. Guan Yu chuckled wryly and resumed, “Some days later, Zhu’er accompanied her mother to a temple to burn incense. By chance, they encountered Gan Lu and his mother. Overjoyed, Zhu’er saw this as her long-awaited opportunity.

“While their elders conversed, Zhu’er seized the chance to chat with Gan Lu in the temple’s corridor. Though Zhu’er was delighted, Gan Lu appeared indifferent. One would think he’d at least recall their meeting on the spider’s web. Troubled by his aloofness, Zhu’er asked, ‘Gan Lu, don’t you remember what happened sixteen years ago on that spiderweb? We met then!’

“Gan Lu looked at her curiously, recalling neither the event nor the spiderweb. He seemed to think she was fabricating a tale to approach him. ‘Miss Zhu’er,’ he said, ‘you’re lovely and charming, but I don’t understand your meaning. Perhaps your imagination is too vivid.’ With a resigned shake of his head, he left with his mother, as if pitying such a beautiful girl for being delusional.”

“It’s over! Gan Lu must have shifted his affections—no doubt to the emperor’s youngest princess!” Qiqi blurted out again.

“Qiqi, you’re testing my limits! I’m sure you’re doing this on purpose!” Wang Xiaorong sprang from the bed, pointing furiously at Qiqi.

This time, Wang Xiaorong’s anger was genuine. Even Qiqi, who usually feared no one, cowered like a kitten clinging to Guan Yu’s arm. Clearly, she regretted her actions, though her interruptions were never intentional—just impulsive.

“There, there. She’s young—don’t hold it against her,” Guan Yu said, patting Qiqi’s head as she nestled meekly against his shoulder. “Lie back down and let me finish. Do you really want this story to last all night?”

Wang Xiaorong wordlessly lay back, still seething. Once both quieted, Guan Yu continued, “Gan Lu’s coldness left Zhu’er bewildered and heartbroken. She’d waited sixteen years for this moment, only to find he remembered nothing.

“Zhu’er wondered why Buddha had ordained this bond if Gan Lu remained oblivious. Days later, to celebrate, the emperor decreed two marriages: the Top Scholar Gan Lu to wed Princess Changfeng.”

“See? I knew Princess Changfeng would—” Qiqi cut herself off, swallowing her words under Wang Xiaorong’s glare. “Guan Yu, keep going!” she squeaked.

Guan Yu smiled, soothingly stroking her hair. “The other union was between Zhu’er and Prince Zhicao. While the others rejoiced, Zhu’er felt thunderstruck. How could Buddha’s plan be wrong? Why pair her with Zhicao when her heart belonged to Gan Lu?

“Tormented, Zhu’er secluded herself, refusing food or company. Days passed, her life hanging by a thread. When Prince Zhicao learned of her state, he rushed to her side. ‘At the banquet, I fell for you at first sight,’ he confessed. ‘I begged my father for this marriage. If you die, I’ll join you.’”

Here, Wang Xiaorong murmured, “It’s a tragedy—worse than I imagined. Even as a story, it pains me.”

“You scold me for speaking, yet you do it yourself!” Qiqi retorted, seizing the chance to counter.

“I only spoke once! Unlike you, who kept interrupting earlier,” Wang Xiaorong snapped.

“Let me finish,” Guan Yu interjected. “Seeing Zhu’er’s condition, Prince Zhicao guiltily drew his sword to take his life—”

Both girls gripped Guan Yu’s arms, tense with anticipation.

“At that moment, golden light flashed—Buddha appeared, freezing time. He gazed at the dying Zhu’er and the suicidal prince, sighing.

“‘Why did your ordained fate differ?’ Zhu’er asked Buddha.

“‘Gan Lu—the dew—was brought to your web by the wind, Princess Changfeng,’ Buddha replied. ‘She later took him back. He was never yours—merely an interlude. But Prince Zhicao…’”

Guan Yu paused deliberately, heightening their suspense.

“Keep going!” Wang Xiaorong urged. “The prince’s sword is still raised!”

Smiling, Guan Yu resumed, “Buddha revealed Zhicao was once an unnamed grass outside the temple, watching Zhu’er for three thousand years, unnoticed. ‘The dearest treasure isn’t the unattained or the lost,’ Buddha asked, ‘but the happiness within reach.’

“Enlightened, Zhu’er awoke, knocked the sword from Zhicao’s hand, and embraced him—the one who’d loved her for millennia.”

As Guan Yu concluded, both girls felt somber. Though the ending was acceptable, their moods had darkened.

“If only Zhu’er and Gan Lu could be together,” Wang Xiaorong mused, “with Princess Changfeng and Zhicao paired differently… Why must things rarely go perfectly?”

“Like our situation—it gives me a headache,” she added. “I wish I were a Cloud Azure Sect disciple, like Siqi. Then no chasm would lie between us.”

Guan Yu had no solution to their身份 dilemma. Qiqi, however, brightened. “It’s a perfect love story! Gan Lu and the princess belonged together, just as I’ll always cherish Guan Yu. We’re fortunate—others should envy us!”

“Qiqi’s outlook is healthier,” Guan Yu remarked. Though Wang Xiaorong masked her worries, her mind churned beneath the surface.

**Chapter 5047: Overslept**

At dawn, Jiang Yuan Kai’s convoy stood ready. Duan Ruxue’s group too waited—only Guan Yu’s trio remained absent.

“Uncle Jiang,” Duan Ruxue suggested, “perhaps check on Brother Wan? They’re unusually late.”

“Since we’re traveling together,” Jiang replied, “call me Uncle. You’re close with Xin’er, and I’m older than your father.”

“Honored, Uncle Jiang. Please call me Ruxue.”

Nodding, Jiang admired her reputed business acumen. “Didn’t Guan Yu stay with you last night? I thought he was to accompany you.”

Blushing, Ruxue muttered, “He vanished with those two women. Who knows what they did, holed up till dawn.” Instantly regretting her tone, she added, “Please check their room.”

Jiang knocked on Guan Yu’s door. “Brother Wan?”

Startled awake, Guan Yu apologized, “We overslept after staying up late. We’ll hurry.”

“No rush,” Jiang said, returning outside.

“Overslept?” Ruxue fumed inwardly. “Disgraceful—carousing all night!”

After a day’s hurried travel, they neared the northern region by dusk. Jiang proposed resting in a small town ahead. Oddly, the streets lay deserted early, few lights glowing—an eerie quietude blanketed the hamlet.
