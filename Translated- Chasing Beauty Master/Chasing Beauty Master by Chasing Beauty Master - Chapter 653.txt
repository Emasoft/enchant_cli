Chapter 1658: A Lesson

Bu Shiren (No Humanity)? Such an...inventive name.

Guan Yu couldn't help bursting into laughter upon hearing Sun Xiaoya address the entering man. This Bu Shiren, also a teacher at Mingyang Elite High, had only arrived this semester. Previously unqualified as an educator, he'd been appointed as a physical education instructor by Principal Liu Shilei through family connections.

Every faculty member secretly loathed Bu Shiren, yet none dared show it—his father being the deputy governor of M Province. Before his arrival, dozens of socialites and ruffians had pursued Sun Xiaoya daily. But since Bu Shiren's appearance, these suitors mysteriously vanished.

Enthralled after glimpsing Sun Xiaoya on the streets, Bu Shiren manipulated his father into procuring a teaching certificate and pressuring Liu Shilei for employment. Though he prided himself on conquering countless women—heiresses and courtesans alike—Sun Xiaoya remained impervious to his charms.

Despite swearing to win her through genuine appeal rather than coercion, Bu Shiren's daily pestering only ceased during his recent week-long provincial absence. Now returned, he seized the chance to "rescue" Sun Xiaoya upon overhearing her scold Guan Yu as a "rascal," barging into the office to teach the student a lesson.

As one of M Province's six or seven pseudo-supernatural beings enhanced by mysterious fluids—safer than risking mutation at divine sites—Bu Shiren considered himself invincible. His background and power had intimidated all previous rivals for Sun Xiaoya's affection, with persistent suitors allegedly ending up "fish food."

When Bu Shiren lunged at Guan Yu with enough force to hospitalize ordinary youths, Sun Xiaoya cried out: "Bu Shiren, don't interfere! Stop!"

Ignoring her plea, Bu Shiren redoubled his strike. Guan Yu coldly intercepted the wrist, his iron grip astonishing the aggressor before a vicious kick sent Bu Shiren airborne.

Sun Xiaoya gasped behind clasped hands. Though aware of Guan Yu's combat skills—having hospitalized Wang Jun before—she never imagined he could overpower Bu Shiren in one move.

Mindful of school propriety, Guan Yu released his grip, letting Bu Shiren crash face-first onto the floor. The commotion drew faculty spectators who stifled smirks at the deputy governor's son's disheveled state.

Bu Shiren scrambled up, humiliation burning through his disbelief. Retrieving a concealed soft-sword belt, he brandished the blade—until Sun Xiaoya shielded Guan Yu: "Harm him, and I'll never speak to you again!"

Principal Liu Shilei's timely arrival enforced restraint. Bu Shiren grudgingly sheathed his weapon, snarling at Guan Yu: "You dare touch my woman? This isn't over!" before storming past Liu.

After dispersing onlookers, Liu questioned Guan Yu about the altercation. The youth explained his medicinal follow-up plans for Sun's mother, omitting the "rascal" misunderstanding.

Liu warned gravely: "Bu Shiren won't relent. His father Bu Zhaodiao commands mutant allies—be cautious." Unfazed, Guan Yu arranged evening treatment with Sun Xiaoya.

By second period, rumors of the clash spread through campus. Yang Lin eagerly confirmed: "Boss! You really beat Bu Shiren?"

Faculty members, long suffering Bu's arrogance, secretly reveled in the comeuppance. Guan Yu shrugged: "Just a kick."

Xu Ying interjected coldly: "Celebrate later. Deputy Governor Bu Zhaodiao will exploit this to harass Principal Liu—he's been pursuing her."

The revelation ignited Guan Yu's fury—how dare they covet his women? Xu Ying elaborated Bu Zhaodiao's background: ex-military officer turned police deputy director who crushed criminal empires using special forces and mutants.

"Though widowed for years, Bu Zhaodiao became infatuated with Principal Liu upon meeting her," Xu Ying explained. "Like son, like father—both believe in winning women through 'charm' rather than force. But after today..."

Yang Lin worried: "A deputy governor versus our principal..."

Xu Ying countered: "Liu's late husband was Dragon Group—his surviving comrades and Tianyu Group (now managed by his other lover) protect her. Even Bu Zhaodiao treads carefully."

As Yang Lin fantasized about polygamous heroes, Xu Ying surprised them by sighing: "If I met such a legendary man, I'd gladly be his concubine."

Guan Yu arched an eyebrow at his icy desk-mate's starry-eyed admission. "You're eighteen," he teased. "How know so much about events from twenty years ago?"

The mystery of Xu Ying's insights deepened as the bell rang, leaving questions hanging in the air.

Chapter 1659: The Bu Family

Bu Shiren's custom soft-sword—previously seen dismembering a gangster—now quivered before Sun Xiaoya's protective stance. "Injure Guan Yu, and I'll never acknowledge you!" she declared.

Principal Liu's arrival enforced restraint: "Teacher Bu! This is a school!"

Though disrespecting Liu, Bu Shiren feared Sun's ultimatum. Sheathing his blade with a bloodied smirk, he spat at Guan Yu: "You'll pay!" before storming out.

Post-conflict inquiries revealed Bu Zhaodiao's designs on Liu Shilei—using his son's humiliation as pretext for renewed advances. Guan Yu's jaw tightened at the notion of rivals touching his women.

Xu Ying disclosed Bu Zhaodiao's brutal rise: military transfers, gang purges, and mutant deployments that cemented his power. "Three years ago, he liquidated M Province's top syndicates," she whispered. "Dozens vanished—fed to crocodiles or dissolved in acid."

Yet Liu Shilei remained protected by her late husband's legacy—Dragon Group veterans and the colossal Tianyu Group, now helmed by his "other lover."

Chapter 1660: The Legend

"Principal Liu's husband had multiple lovers?" Yang Lin marveled. "The ultimate alpha! I'd kill for that life!"

Xu Ying scoffed: "You? He was Dragon Group at twenty—a real legend. They say countless women still pine for him." Her icy demeanor thawed into wistfulness: "To be his concubine...bliss."

Guan Yu concealed a smirk—unaware they discussed his past self. Though Liu avoided discussing his former companions' marriages, he understood time's erosion of youthful passions. Two decades was an eternity—only Liu Shilei and Du Xiaojuan's fidelity astonished him.

As Xu Ying gushed about the legend's harem, Guan Yu probed: "How does an eighteen-year-old know these tales?"

The bell interrupted Xu Ying's answer, leaving Guan Yu to ponder her sources—and the legacy he'd left behind.
