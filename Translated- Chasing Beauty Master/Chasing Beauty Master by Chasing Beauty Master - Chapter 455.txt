**Chapter 1137: The Issue of Qualifications**

**Chapter 1138: Rapid Progress**

**Chapter 1139: Sweeping Through the Sects**

“Hah… Little sister, you’re remarkable. But I can’t afford to lose.” Guan Yu suddenly halted, exhaling deeply as his hands formed seals. His eyes brimmed with gravity. Never had he imagined being pushed to this point—disciples of major sects truly were no weaklings. Still, this ends now.

Ye Qingling also stopped. The relentless attacks and evasions had strained her body. Though her Lightning Arts were formidable, their toll was equally heavy. She couldn’t continue this way; otherwise, exhaustion alone would claim her.

Slowly levitating, Ye Qingling’s expression turned solemn as she clasped her hands in a mantra. Both combatants prepared their ultimate techniques, the air thickening with tension. Even the usually boisterous Qingwei fell silent, breath held as he watched. Ye Qingling’s Lightning Arts were awe-inspiring, but Guan Yu’s mastery of the *Cloud Body Wind Physique* had stunned everyone.

“A minor achievement in the Cloud Body Wind Physique—a Nascent Soul-stage body refinement technique. Troublesome indeed,” murmured the four observers outside the arena, silently evaluating Guan Yu’s cultivation.

“Wood of Yi, Fire of Ding, Earth of Ji, Metal of Xin, Water of Gui… Five Elements Divine Thunder, descend—”

“Fall!” A ruthless glint flashed in Guan Yu’s eyes. Despite the violet lightning’s terrifying aura, he charged forward.

***Boom!***

The purple divine thunder struck true. Simultaneously, Ye Qingling plummeted from mid-air.

“Ah—!”

Sudden weightlessness—tenfold gravity compared to before—sent the girl crashing to the ground. As she looked up, a dark fist and an ugly, grinning face loomed before her.

“Heh. Little lass, surrender,” Guan Yu rasped, his entire body trembling. Yet his fist remained steady. He refrained from striking—he’d never grown accustomed to hitting women.

“Th-thank you… You’re a good person. I concede.” Gratitude flickered in Ye Qingling’s eyes. Guan Yu could have landed that blow, yet he hadn’t.

“To receive a ‘good person card’… How absurd.” After Ye Qingling’s surrender, Guan Yu flexed his numb, electrified limbs and chuckled. His Cloud Body Wind Physique had improved slightly—enduring this lightning baptism had been his true aim all along.

“This Guan Yu… He’s no ordinary man.” The onlookers, elites of their respective sects, noted how Guan Yu could have ended the fight earlier by immobilizing Ye Qingling. Instead, he’d used her lightning to temper his body—a level of ruthlessness toward oneself few could muster.

“Brother Halitosis, your turn.” Though Guan Yu’s appearance was comical—hair standing on end, face charred, robes torn—his bearing now radiated heroic vigor, utterly transforming his earlier rustic demeanor.

“No need. I forfeit.” Qingwei shrugged, refusing a hopeless battle.

“How prudent. I’ll still find a chance to thrash you someday.” Guan Yu blinked, surprised by the quick surrender. His eyes roamed Qingwei’s form, making the latter shudder in regret.

The third challenger, Zhang Feng of Maoshan, specialized in talismanic arts and spirit-summoning. After assessing Guan Yu’s gravity manipulation, he too withdrew.

The fourth, Mei Ruoxue of Qingcheng—a secular sword cultivator—embodied her sect’s philosophy: *One sword to sever all techniques*. Qingcheng, an all-female sect claiming heritage from Shu Mountain’s legacy, focused on sword dao.

Though powerful, Mei Ruoxue’s swordplay was stifled by Guan Yu’s counters, reducing her effectiveness by half. After three strikes, she conceded gracefully—major sect disciples retained their pride, avoiding petty stubbornness.

“Amitabha Buddha. Esteemed patron, this humble monk Dharma Adversity seeks your guidance.” The final challenger, a Jiuhua Mountain monk, radiated solemn dignity.

“No formalities, master. Begin!” Guan Yu laughed and lunged forth with a punch.

***Boom!***

Both men staggered back seven or eight steps. Guan Yu gaped at the monk—his golden-hued skin resembled a gilded statue, marking him as a body refinement expert.

“Again, master!” Shaking his numbed right hand, Guan Yu charged once more.

***Boom! Boom! Boom!***

Their clash became a pure contest of strength—colliding, retreating, colliding again. Each impact grew fiercer, leaving spectators awestruck.

“Master… Again!”

After countless exchanges, Guan Yu—blood trickling from his lips—grinned wolfishly. Wiping the blood, he stomped forward for another collision.

“Madmen… Absolute madmen!” Qingwei muttered, pulse racing at this primal display of masculinity.

“Tch… Just two brutes clashing. Dull.” Mei Ruoxue’s icy demeanor cracked momentarily before she scoffed, lips pursed—a classic feminine contradiction.

“Amitabha… Patron Guan, cease. This monk concedes.” Dharma Adversity finally trembled out his surrender. He’d clung to pride in his body refinement—his greatest strength—yet still faltered first.

“Hah… Master, I thank you.” Guan Yu exhaled deeply. Victory at last?

“Master… I’ve fulfilled my duty. The qualification… is ours.” Turning toward Wild Crane Daoist, Guan Yu’s vision darkened as he collapsed.

**Chapter 1140: The Challenge to Yin Ye**

As the crowd dispersed, Guan Yu faced Wild Crane Daoist. Now, his master would unveil long-hidden truths—secrets he’d yearned to uncover. Would they match his conjectures? What earth-shattering mysteries awaited? Anticipation burned.

Wild Crane Daoist’s expression shifted. Flash-stepping to Guan Yu’s side, he conducted a swift inspection before sweeping a gaze across the three sects’ observers.

“Well? Satisfied?” His divine sense’s pressure washed over the juniors. Most bowed their heads; those who resisted winced, unable to meet his eyes.

“Amitabha. Overcoming three foes through sheer might… Guan Yu possesses heroic mettle. This Dharma Ability approves—no objections to his qualification.” Jiuhua Mountain declared first.

“He is formidable. Congratulations on gaining such a successor.” A Qingcheng maiden in green robes bowed respectfully, signaling assent.

“Ah, I thought it might be you. How fares your master?” Wild Crane’s stern face softened slightly upon seeing her—clearly they shared history.

“Master prepares for tribulation transcendence and couldn’t attend. Regarding recent events… Qingcheng erred. Senior’s grace rebuilt our sect. Elder Nine Reflections acted wrongly.” The girl’s blunt speech carried an icy edge as her gaze swept the Kunlun contingent. Those with keen eyes noted fleeting violet sharpness in her pupils—a blade’s glint.

“Since Guan Daoist prevailed, Kunlun raises no objection.” The Kunlun representative remained placid, his depth befitting a top disciple.

“Then this old Daoist takes leave.” With a wave, Wild Crane vanished with Guan Yu.

Guan Yu awoke a day later submerged in pitch-black medicinal liquid. Every fiber screamed—bones splintered, blood boiling, skin crawling with phantom ants. Yet he couldn’t twitch a muscle beyond breathing.

“How do you feel?” Others might call Guan Yu foolish, but Wild Crane understood his disciple’s true purpose.

“I’ll recover. Only the Dharma Assembly’s timing concerns me.” Closing his eyes, Guan Yu embraced the agonizing itch—the brew nourished his foundation, repairing past haste in body refinement.

“Your injuries are trivial, fortifying your unstable foundation from rapid cultivation. Rest three days. You’ve done well.” Wild Crane smiled approvingly.

***Crack! Crack!***

After completing a fist form, Guan Yu’s joints popped like firecrackers. His power and speed had surged by twenty percent.

“Big Brother Guan! Where are we going today? You haven’t taken me out since Sister Huowu left!” A lilting voice announced Kunlun’s little disciple, Ye Qingling.

“Those bastards… Corrupting an innocent girl then abandoning her to me—must husbands repay wives’ debts?” Guan Yu’s murderous glare could’ve slain onlookers as the sprinting figure approached.

“Last time your senior brother dragged you back—still unafraid?” Guan Yu sighed. Despite the blood feud between White Cloud Temple and Kunlun, this girl had hounded him since his recovery.

Previously, his wives had intervened, but Ye Qingling somehow befriended them. After entrusting his mortal assets to his spouses for consolidation into a conglomerate, their departure left the girl unchecked.

“He won’t today… Wait—” Ye Qingling froze under Guan Yu’s knowing gaze.

“Guan Yu. I warned you against approaching my junior sister.” Kunlun’s head disciple, Yin Ye, emerged from shadows, spiritual energy rippling with fury.

“Check who sought whom. Who I associate with is none of your concern, Yin Ye.” Guan Yu met the intimidating gaze unflinchingly.

“Senior Brother, I—”

“Silence! Master entrusted you to me. I’ll not permit contact with his kind. Return now!” Murderous intent radiated from Yin Ye.

“Senior Brother, my friendships are not yours to dictate. Even Father couldn’t control me so!” Ye Qingling’s face frosted over—none in Kunlun dared oppose her whims.

“Guan Yu! Dare you duel? Life and death irrelevant—do you dare?” Yin Ye’s voice dripped venomous humiliation.

“After the Dharma Assembly. Come then. Qingling, wasn’t this our last outing? Let’s go.” Guan Yu smirked. Kunlun’s slaughter of White Cloud disciples demanded vengeance—he’d seize any chance.

“Hmph… Guan Yu… Ye Qingling… This shame burns deep.” Yin Ye watched their departing backs, sleeves flaring as he stormed away.

**Chapter 1141: Dharma Assembly (Part 1)**

“Heh. Guan Yu… What karmic collision. Brother Yin, have Central Plains sects weakened so? Even trash like him claims a qualification?” Yan Qing sneered at the match list bearing Guan Yu’s name.

“His weakness you’ll soon learn. As for Central Plains’ strength… You’ll know immediately.” Though disdainful himself, Yin Ye retorted. His eyes flicked toward a distant figure bearing a massive sword—a promised opponent replaced, stirring dark currents.

The opening match—Zhang Xiaojun versus Yin Ye—pitched Pure Yang’s reincarnation (Heavy Sword Palace’s heir) against Central Plains’ proclaimed top junior. Who would claim victory?

“Brother Yin, your move.”

“Begin.”

***Shing!***

Zhang Xiaojun’s black greatsword erupted like lightning, mountain-crushing momentum descending deceptively slow—the same technique used against Guan Yu.

***Sssst! Ding!***

Yin Ye flicked a finger. The sword recoiled violently, sending Zhang stumbling back three steps, face flushed with shock.

“This… is Pure Yang’s incarnation? Disappointing. One more attempt—fail to interest me, and you forfeit your chance.” Yin Ye’s languid arrogance drew no objections—his reputation warranted it.

“*Lin, Bing, Dou, Zhe, Jie, Zhen, Lie, Zai, Qian… Annihilate Evil!*”

***Roar!***

A golden dragon materialized, claws outstretched toward Yin Ye.

“No dragon soul—your Nine Seals union remains incomplete. How tedious.” Yin Ye sighed, producing a yellow banner. With a shake, golden lotuses bloomed mid-air. The dragon dissolved upon contact like mud in water.

“Im…possible!” Zhang Xiaojun paled, dao heart fracturing at his ultimate technique’s effortless nullification.
