Jiang Yuankai thought bitterly, “To think I’ve been reduced to this state—to die at the hands of this beast! What a waste! So much remains undone. If my life ends here, the regret will be unbearable.”

His thoughts turned to the Princess Royal, then to Jiang Xin—his wife and beloved daughter. He wondered what they were doing now. Did Jiang Xin remember to tuck herself in properly tonight?

The poison in his body spread rapidly. Combined with his existing injuries, half his body had already gone numb. Confronting this beast now was impossible.

Resigned, Jiang Yuankai ceased resisting. Why struggle when defeat was certain and escape impossible?

The monster danced grotesquely, waving its massive front claws in the air like a macabre celebration, infuriating Jiang Yuankai to the core.

Having reveled enough, the beast lunged forward, claws descending toward him. A direct hit would crush him into pulp.

As the claw loomed before his eyes, Jiang Yuankai closed his eyes, offering a final prayer: may the Princess Royal and Jiang Xin live healthy, happy lives.

Just as he awaited death, a thunderous explosion shook the air, followed by the monster’s muffled roar. What had happened?

When Jiang Yuankai tried to open his eyes again, his eyelids felt leaden. The poison’s spread had blurred his consciousness.

With immense effort, he glimpsed the monster under relentless assault by glowing Aura Slashes—a technique he recognized. Turning his head slightly, he saw Guan Yu dart forward, planting himself firmly between Jiang Yuankai and the beast.

Jiang Yuankai’s last vestige of strength vanished. His eyes shut as he fell unconscious. Guan Yu’s timely arrival had snatched him from death’s jaws—a delay of mere seconds would have left him a bloody smear.

Earlier, Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong had emerged from the underground tunnels. After reuniting with the troops via flight magic, they grew uneasy when Jiang Yuankai failed to return on schedule. Sensing trouble, Guan Yu raced back alone, fearing the commander might face a lethal opponent in the unfamiliar depths.

From afar, Guan Yu heard combat. Accelerating, he launched long-range Aura Slashes to distract the beast, arriving just in time to save Jiang Yuankai.

Seeing Jiang Yuankai’s grave condition, Guan Yu prioritized eliminating the threat. Though puzzled how a wounded beast caused such severe injuries, he focused on the fight.

Channeling internal energy outward, Guan Yu conjured a defensive shield. Though simpler than his previous “eggshell” barrier, it sufficed to nullify the monster’s claw strikes.

Raising the Soulfall Blade overhead, Guan Yu chanted incantations, gathering power for a devastating single-target spell.

The monster, battered by multiple Aura Slashes, wavered. Though its claws were iron-hard, relentless attacks wore it down. Worse, an embedded crossbow bolt caused excruciating pain.

Gone was its earlier frenzy. The beast now swayed warily, claws raised defensively against incoming strikes. Its twin antennae twitched restlessly, scheming unseen strategies.

Guan Yu’s spell reached completion—Mountain-Piercing Sword, a technique learned from Xiao Dong at Cloudgreen Sect’s back mountains. The spell’s power scaled infinitely with the caster’s energy.

At Guan Yu’s level, this technique could split mountains. Above his blade materialized a colossal azure energy sword, expanding as he channeled more power.

The monster panicked. Trapped in the narrow tunnel with no room to dodge, it emitted black smoke from its horns, attempting to shroud itself—too late.

With a piercing shriek, the energy sword lanced through the beast’s skull before embedding into the cave wall. The resulting shockwave nearly collapsed the tunnel. Falling boulders crushed the mortally wounded monster.

Breathing deeply, Guan Yu turned to Jiang Yuankai—now corpse-pale with dark purple skin, a sign of profound poisoning. Hoisting the commander, Guan Yu raced to camp while channeling healing energy to protect his heart meridian.

At the military camp, the sight of Jiang Yuankai horrified all. Xiao Wu, his loyal subordinate, wept openly.

“Stay calm,” Guan Yu ordered. “I’ve stabilized him. Prepare a large tub of hot water—immediately!”

Through the night, Guan Yu detoxified Jiang Yuankai in the medicinal bath. By dawn, the water had turned deep purple with expelled toxins. Though Jiang Yuankai remained unconscious, his vital signs stabilized.

Examining the wounds—a shoulder bite and strange ankle lacerations—Guan Yu puzzled over the beast’s venomous nature. Only his own poison-immunity as a Realm Lord allowed such risky treatment.

To Xiao Wu’s anxious query, Guan Yu reassured, “He’ll live, but needs rest. Guard his tent—we’ll plan next steps when he wakes.”

Privately, Guan Yu knew recovery wouldn’t be easy. The corrosive venom had damaged Jiang Yuankai’s dantian—his core energy reservoir. Whether he could regain his martial prowess depended on both body and mind.

Two days passed without Jiang Yuankai awakening. Guan Yu maintained vigilant care, though the slow-healing wounds worried him.

Remembering the monster’s carcass, Guan Yu sought the centurion’s aid. “Its remains hold valuable materials. Lend me twenty men to retrieve them.”

Assured of safety, the officer agreed. Guan Yu brought Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi—their expertise would identify useful parts. Armed with torches, the group reentered the tunnels, ready to harvest the beast’s riches.
