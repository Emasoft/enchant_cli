“Good, hit him hard! Uproot him completely!”

“Brother-in-law is so domineering! Brother-in-law is mighty!” The girls cheered for Guan Yu on the sidelines. No one expected Guan Yu’s seemingly frail frame to send the burly man flying with a single kick.

“See? I told you they couldn’t beat Guan Yu,” Lan Yu declared proudly, though inwardly she had been sweating bullets for him.

“Goddammit! Where did this brat come from?” Da Quan cursed, clutching his bleeding head. “Today, I’ll cripple you! Everyone, attack!”

As Da Quan charged first, Guan Yu grabbed a wine bottle. Ignoring the blood streaming down the man’s face, he swung the bottle at Da Quan’s skull. The thug stumbled back, shielding his head in terror. With a flying kick, Guan Yu sent another attacker crashing into tables. Glass shattered as the man collapsed, unmoving.

Three others lunged forward, desperate to seize the two beauties behind Guan Yu. But they sorely underestimated his skills.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

Fists and feet blurred. Within moments, all lay groaning on the floor. The bar crowd gasped—this youth had effortlessly dismantled Da Quan’s gang. Many spectators exchanged vindicated glances, having long suffered under these bullies.

“Yay! Long live Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law, I love you! Show them who’s boss!” Lan Yu’s sisters bounced excitedly. One of the rescued girls stepped forward, wine bottle in hand.

*Clang!*

Her weak swing left the unbroken bottle rolling on the floor. Frustrated, she kicked Da Quan square in the face. “You wanted to rape me? Take this!”

“Mercy, goddess! I’ll never dare again!” Da Quan wailed, curled into a ball as her blows rained down.

Breathless, the girl spat, “Trash like you deserves execution!” Police sirens wailed in the distance.

Guan Yu blinked at her ferocity—Da Quan’s face now resembled a swollen melon. “Thank you for saving us,” she said, turning to him.

“Th-thank you,” whispered the timid girl behind Guan Yu, her voice barely audible.

“My pleasure. Rescuing two fair maidens is an honor.” His charming smile ignited squeals from Lan Yu’s friends.

“Uh-oh, Lan Yu! New rivals alert!”

“Brother-in-law’s totally into them! Aren’t you gonna do something?”

“So unfair! Just say the word, and we’ll teach those vixens a lesson!”

Lan Yu marched over, linking arms with Guan Yu. “I’m his girlfriend.”

“But Guan Yu’s dating Lü Mei, the campus belle, and Yang Conghan, A-City’s top beauty!” Xie Yulu blurted.

Lan Yu’s smile froze as her friends pounced:

“Oho! Brother-in-law’s quite the Casanova!”

“Better watch your little brother, Guan Yu!”

Before tensions escalated, police stormed in. “Who called?”

“Officer! These men tried to assault us!” Xie Yulu pointed at the groaning thugs.

As officers moved to arrest them, a booming voice halted the scene. Li Zhiming, the bar’s owner, descended the stairs. “Ma Officer! Why are you harassing my staff?”

The policeman stiffened. “Multiple witnesses corroborate—”

“Witnesses?” Li sneered, scanning the crowd. “Anyone actually see anything?”

Silence.

“You lying tramp!” Li jabbed a finger at Xie Yulu. Guan Yu stepped between them.

“Care to remove that filthy hand?” Guan Yu’s smile didn’t reach his eyes.

“You think the Second Boss’s name protects you? Even he wouldn’t dare cross me!”

*Crash!*

Guan Yu smashed a bottle over Da Quan’s head. “Anyone see that?”

“Nope!” Lan Yu’s chorus chirped.

Li Zhiming’s face purpled. “Ma! Arrest him!”

The officer shrugged, phone in hand. “Sorry, I was dialing 120 for your injured men.”

Enraged, Li charged Guan Yu—only to freeze as golden light enveloped the youth. Both men levitated, energy crackling.

“Whoa! Brother-in-law’s flying!”

Palm strikes met energy shields in explosive bursts. Tables splintered as the duel escalated.

Li flicked his wrist, sending pink lotus-shaped blasts. Guan Yu countered with searing white beams.

Outside, Lan Yu bit her lip. “Be safe...”

The true battle had just begun.
