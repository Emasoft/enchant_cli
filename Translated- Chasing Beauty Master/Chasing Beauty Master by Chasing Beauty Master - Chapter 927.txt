“In that case, there might be internal conflicts. If any disputes arise, my people would side with me while his would support Hou Jinshun's faction. That would complicate matters. Essentially, we're two separate groups. Merging would be extremely difficult.”

Guan Yu nodded, acknowledging the truth in Jones' words. With more people involved, some were bound to be arrogant, inevitably leading to numerous internal conflicts.

"You're right. Given this situation, perhaps it's better to let Hou Jinshun establish his own organization. However, you must help resolve matters at my school. It's simple—just let them operate under your Free Organization's banner," Guan Yu said.

"If Manager Hou is willing, I'd warmly welcome him to join my organization. Of course, I wouldn't treat him poorly. I'd assign him a respectable position," Jones replied, his years of leadership evident in his calculated approach to gang affairs.

Guan Yu immediately grasped Jones' implication. With a chuckle, he probed, "How cunning. You reject my merger proposal citing potential troubles, yet now propose absorbing Hou Jinshun's group. That's essentially swallowing them whole."

"The difference is vast. A merger implies equal standing, but absorption would relegate Hou's people to subordinate status beneath your own faction."

Jones smiled and rose to gaze out the window. "Precisely. In a merger, neither side would yield during conflicts. But if absorbed, they'd have to obey my decisions during disputes."

"I'd enforce my rulings absolutely. Anyone dissatisfied could be expelled immediately. This method resolves internal issues cleanly."

Guan Yu shook his head. "Impossible. Let's drop this matter." He knew most of Hou Jinshun's associates at the Flower Club were proud individuals merely humoring Hou. Getting them to join the Free Organization was already challenging enough—submission was out of the question. If Hou's group wanted independence, so be it. Guan Yu had initially hoped combining forces would create greater unity, but Jones' reasoning proved sound—forced unity without true cohesion would only breed mutual blame during crises.

Time flowed unnoticed until dusk painted the sky. Guan Yu stood. "It's late. We've dined and discussed. We should depart."

Xue Jing suddenly exclaimed, "Oh! I forgot to inform Amei! That silly girl must be waiting with dinner at home!" She immediately called Amei.

Jones turned directly to Guan Yu. "Indeed late. Though I know you'd refuse staying overnight, I hope you'll visit frequently."

"Rest assured," Guan Yu affirmed. "I'll never forget you. Many dangerous missions lie ahead where I'll need your expertise. You're a master I can rely on."

"I never refuse your requests, though you rarely ask. Even perilous missions excite me—have you forgotten I'm a cultivation fanatic? I crave battles between experts!"

**Chapter 2371: Heartache Revisited**

Guan Yu nodded firmly. "I'll remember. When dangerous tasks arise where others can't assist, I'll seek you—a true master."

"Your requests are always welcome. Few though they are, even dangerous ones thrill me. Don't you know I live for combat between skilled warriors?"

With Jones' declaration, Guan Yu could only concede. "Very well. I actually need your help soon. I'll contact you."

Xue Jing remained silent during serious discussions—a wise choice, as unnecessary interruptions might diminish her standing with Guan Yu. When matters concluded, Guan Yu said farewell.

Jones escorted them to the underground parking. As they drove off, Xue Jing inquired, "What mission requires Jones' help? Whatever it is, I'm coming!"

"Your cultivation makes you useful," Guan Yu acknowledged. "This needs careful planning—about a week out. You'll be involved."

Xue Jing pressed eagerly, "What is it? I haven't accompanied you on missions lately. The anticipation excites me!"

Though Xue Jing was trustworthy, Guan Yu decided to withhold details after her earlier teasing with Jones. With mock seriousness, he asked, "Truly curious?"

"Can't you see I'm burning with curiosity?" Xue Jing's large eyes widened.

Guan Yu smirked. "Oh I see it... but I won't tell."

Xue Jing exploded. "Guan Yu! You enjoy mocking me? This isn't over!" She lunged to pinch him as he drove, causing dangerous swerves.

"Stop! I'm driving!" he protested, but Xue Jing persisted until finally landing a vicious twist on his waist. The pain lingered even after they reached Qiaoyuan District.

Inspecting the injury, Guan Yu discovered an angry welt with bloodied streaks. "Damn, Xue Jing! You drew blood!"

"Serves you right!" she retorted. "What kind of man complains about a little pinch? And you call yourself a cultivator!"

"A cultivator's flesh still feels pain!" he countered.

Their bickering greeted Amei, who rushed out concerned. "What happened? Arguing right after returning?"

Both simultaneously snapped "Ask him/her!" before laughing. Guan Yu asked about dinner while limping inside.

Noticing his discomfort, Amei inspected the wound and gasped. Tears welled as she confronted Xue Jing. "How could you hurt him so? Look at this swelling and bleeding!"

Xue Jing defended awkwardly, "I didn't know it'd be this bad! He's a grown man—"

"A man's skin isn't armor!" Amei shot back tearfully, fetching medical supplies. Her gentle hands disinfected the wound, blowing softly to ease the sting.

Guan Yu marveled at her compassion—a tenderness unmatched by others. He suddenly recalled Amei's past: her meteoric rise to stardom solely to find him, the amnesiac man who'd saved her mother. Her transformation from delicate village girl to determined superstar, then back to gentle Amei upon their reunion, spoke volumes about her hidden strength.

As Amei tended him, Guan Yu asked about their shared past. Her eyes misted as she recounted their impoverished history—selling possessions, scavenging food, even wrestling scraps from dogs to feed her dying mother. Through tears, she described how her mother's dying words forged her resilience.

Guan Yu held her close, moved by her story. Amei's journey from destitution to stardom, all to reunite with her savior, revealed depths of determination belying her fragile appearance. Yet key mysteries remained—what exactly had Guan Yu done? Full answers awaited his regained memories... and the promised reunion with樱子(Yingzi) that might restore them.
