Guan Yu gazed at his reflection in the mirror – a pristine azure shirt paired with black skinny jeans. Though simple, the ensemble grew more dashing the longer he looked. He couldn't help marveling that his own fashion sense had been outdone by an old man.

"Ha! I'll make those codgers green with envy!" Old Master Feng guffawed, crimson-faced with satisfaction. "Always sneering about the Feng family lacking male heirs. Let's see whose progeny comes out on top now!" The patriarch seemed to already envision Guan Yu trouncing the other elders' sons and grandsons.

"Let's move, move!" Impatience overtook Feng as he practically dragged Guan Yu out the door.

"Lao He! Drive!" The old man barked at his chauffeer of fifteen years upon entering the car. The veteran driver floored the accelerator, swerving through traffic with practiced urgency.

Would it kill you to tell the guest of honor our destination? Guan Yu screamed internally as the vehicle careened through intersections. Feng remained fixated ahead, periodically bursting into raucous laughter before muttering curses about their slow progress. Never had he anticipated a gathering so keenly.

"We're here." Lao He announced under Feng's withering glare, having run five red lights to reach the Glorious Five-Star Hotel. Before the car fully stopped, Feng tumbled out, yanking Guan Yu's door open.

"Careful, Master!" Guan Yu's heart nearly stopped. If anything happened to the patriarch, Feng Xin's fiery temper would have him drawn and quartered.

"My bones are sturdier than you youngsters'!" Feng retorted, eyes bulging with mock anger before dissolving into hearty laughter. He strode through the revolving doors like a general claiming territory.

"Good afternoon. Do you have a reservation?" A receptionist's plastic smile greeted them.

"Reservation? Seventh floor!" Feng waved dismissively.

"Apologies, the seventh floor hosts a private event. May I see your invitation?"

"Damn that Xu! Since when do we need formalities?" Feng roared, having clearly discarded the invite. As security moved to block them, a booming voice interrupted:

"Master Feng! What keeps you at the threshold?" A slick-haired man in mahogany suit approached, his pomaded coiffure gleaming like lacquered wood.

"Qi Xugao! You've regressed with age." Feng teased the newcomer.

"Says the walking fossil!" The man shot back with equal mirth.

"Aged like fine wine, my friend." Feng preened, oblivious to Guan Yu's internal eye-roll at his master's antics.

"Where's that granddaughter of yours today?" Qi Xugao's gaze swept over Guan Yu with thinly veered contempt. The barb struck deep – Feng's only son had died young, leaving only a granddaughter as heir.

"My girl handles real business, unlike your idle whelps." Feng's retort about their unambitious offspring drew splutters of rage.

"Feng! Qi! Early birds catching worms?" A new voice boomed as Xu Chengqi arrived, arms spread in welcome.

"Xu! What's this invitation nonsense?" Feng immediately berated the host.

"Pretentious rubbish!" Qi chimed in, equally invitation-less.

Xu's apology rang hollow as he herded the group upstairs. The seventh floor revealed an elegant lounge with scholar's rocks and trickling water features. Guan Yu noted each elder brought only one sharp-eyed companion – all eyeing him with disdain.

"Introducing my disciple, Guan Yu!" Feng declared with pride when questioned. As greetings exchanged, Guan Yu caught Qi Xugao's mental scoff at his "puny frame."

The gathering's undercurrents crystallized when Xu proposed merging the five gangs. Outcry erupted:

"You think we'd swallow this?" Lin Qian's grandson slammed the table.

"Daydreamer!" Others joined the chorus.

Xu's smile turned venomous. A clap summoned twenty thugs from side doors.

"Think these mutts can hold us?" Lin Qian sneered.

"Would I be so crude?" Xu nodded to his grandson.

Muscle-relaxing drugs in signature dishes," Xu Xu announced smugly. As the younger generation collapsed, Feng alone remained standing – Guan Yu's warning having spared him tainted dishes.

Xu Chengqi's mask finally slipped. "The game's mine now."

"Not quite." Feng rose steadily, the chessboard's final piece still in play.
