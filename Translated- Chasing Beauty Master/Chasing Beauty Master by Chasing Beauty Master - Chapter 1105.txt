“Stop this nonsense, will you?” Bill Lin instantly put on a smiling facade, assuming Yuan Shanding’s decision to leave stemmed from his earlier suspicions of a mole in their group. With a forced grin, he said, “Brother Yuan, don’t joke with me. If I spent twenty million to rescue you all, I clearly hold no grudge. There’s no need for such drastic measures, is there?”

Yuan Shanding shook his head. “This isn’t about grudges. We’re simply not cut from the same cloth, and further collaboration is pointless. I ventured out seeking new opportunities, but the outside world isn’t as idyllic or simple as I imagined. Adapting here has proven too difficult. I’ve decided to return to the mountains with my people.”

Bill Lin panicked, springing to his feet. “Brother Yuan! Don’t you crave city life? Would you truly rot your whole life in those godforsaken mountains? Staying with me offers your best chance for growth!”

Poison Widow had initially assumed Yuan’s declaration was mere posturing to dispel suspicion, but now his resolve seemed genuine.

“Brother Yuan, why this sudden decision? Has Master Bill failed in his hospitality? And where is Sister Jiu?” Poison Widow pressed, voicing the critical question.

Her inquiry jolted Bill Lin, who now realized Jiu Buyun’s conspicuous absence—an oversight he’d made earlier.

“Right! Where is Sister Jiu?” Bill Lin demanded.

Yuan Shanding answered plainly, “Her disappearance is precisely why I must leave. Guan Yu has taken Jiu Buyun hostage. He threatened her life if I continue serving you, Master Bill. For her sake, I have no choice.”

“What?!” Bill Lin exploded, eyes blazing as he glared at Yuan. “You’re telling me now? After I wasted twenty million rescuing useless deadweight?!”

Poison Widow grew anxious. Without Yuan’s group, her standing with Bill Lin would crumble, along with her aspirations of becoming a recognized member of the Bill family like Luo Bo, enjoying lavish annual stipends instead of endless underworld struggles. Her plans were unraveling before they’d borne fruit.

“Brother Yuan,” she implored, “please elaborate. How could a first-grade expert like Sister Jiu fall into Guan Yu’s clutches?”

“It was Guan Yu’s subordinate,” Yuan explained. “He shattered Jiu’s arm upon arrival. After Guan Yu’s people treated her, they issued their ultimatum. You know our decades-long bond, Sister. I can’t abandon her.”

Bill Lin’s fury intensified. His twenty million hadn’t just bought temporary reprieve—it had purchased worthless assets. “You fucking knew all along!” he roared. “You conspired with Guan Yu to trick me!”

Yuan silently cursed—had he revealed the truth earlier, Bill would never have paid their ransom. Survival had demanded deception.

In truth, even forewarned, Bill Lin might still have paid to avoid legal entanglements had Guan Yu turned them in. But losing these fighters meant more than financial loss—replacing such skilled operatives against Guan Yu would prove impossible.

Chapter 26826: No Alternatives

Poison Widow steadied herself. “Brother Yuan, don’t act rashly. There might still be solutions. This is your golden opportunity! Would you truly return to stagnant mountain life?”

Bill Lin regained composure. “She’s right. I need your help desperately. Would friends abandon each other in crisis?”

...

Chapter 26827: A Bad Solution

Bill Lin paused to take a cigarette drag. “The Yangs’ private clinic hosts renowned foreign physicians. Only the elite gain admission for serious illnesses—security includes over a hundred armed specialists from the gates inward. No one dares cause trouble there.”

Yuan’s hopes crumbled. Rescue seemed impossible—better to retreat to the mountains where Guan Yu permitted occasional calls with Jiu.

“Is Yang’s clinic truly that formidable?” Poison Widow questioned.

“More so,” Bill Lin confirmed. “Their guards operate under official permits—that’s their real power.”

“Then we’re helpless,” Yuan concluded. “I’ll trouble you no further, Master Bill.”

“Wait!” Bill interjected. “You promised two days! If I fail by then, leave freely.”

Yuan nodded. “Since you insist, I’ll wait.”

Relieved, Bill dismissed them. Alone with Luo Bo, he asked, “Any ideas?”

“No good ones,” Luo Bo smirked. “But a bad one—kill Jiu Buyun.”

Bill Lin’s eyes lit up. Eliminating Jiu in Yang’s clinic would sever Guan Yu’s leverage and inflame Yuan’s hatred—a perfect solution.

“Brilliant!” Bill exclaimed. “Not bad—genius! Who better than you for this?”

Chapter 26828: Against Reason

After securing Feng family head’s cooperation, Luo Bo planned infiltration under medical pretext. At Yang Clinic, Administrator Yang briefed Old Master Yang: “Guan Yu admitted a mysterious woman today—arm severed. She’s connected to today’s temple battle involving Bill Lin.”

Old Master Yang chuckled when Feng’s call arrived. “Our guest comes for the woman. Let them scheme—we’ll observe.”

That night, disguised Luo Bo and Poison Widow accompanied Feng to Yang Clinic, poised to strike.
