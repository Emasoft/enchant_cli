“Jiang Yuankai’s words were clear, and Guan Yu understood them well. Guan Yu said, “I have already met Duan Ruxue (Like Snow) and Master Duan. What they spoke of, I believe to be true. Moreover, Duan Ruxue’s primary aim is to assist us while securing some benefit for herself. I find this entirely reasonable. After all, without their information, who knows how long it would have taken us to locate the true East Sea region.”

“If that is the case, and even Brother Wanhong believes it, then I too shall trust it completely,” Jiang Yuankai replied. “The Duan family’s reputation in the capital is impeccable. Among the four great clans, they are the only one with such sterling standing. They act prudently, neither provoking nor flattering others—a quality I deeply respect. Though we’ve had little interaction with them before, if they can aid us in this matter, it may pave the way for significant future collaboration in business.”

Reassured by Jiang Yuankai’s stance, Guan Yu felt more at ease, now grasping the other’s thoughts. “The truth is, Master Duan told me that when he was very young, his hometown was a small town by the East Sea, nestled against its edge—a place surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on the other, with dense forests atop the peaks. It was a secluded haven.

But then a catastrophe struck. The East Sea underwent a drastic transformation, its waters swallowing the entire town. Only Master Duan and his grandfather escaped, eventually settling in the capital. Over the years, they never returned. Rumors speak of water monsters emerging near the ruins of the East Sea town, though their veracity remains unconfirmed. If that East Sea is indeed the one we seek, our task would be far simpler.”

“For Master Duan to share this with you signifies his trust,” Jiang Yuankai nodded. “Though the East Sea Dragon Pearl is in my possession, should we truly uncover the East Sea Treasure, I shall ensure the Duan family is duly rewarded. This I vow before Brother Wanhong.”

Guan Yu nodded in approval. “I plan to depart for a few days. Brother Jiang, please prepare during this time. I intend to visit the site with Miss Duan. Will you join us?”

Jiang Yuankai longed to accompany them, but familial obligations bound him, and the Princess Consort would never permit his absence. After a pause, he said, “Alas, I cannot. However, if Brother Wanhong requires aid, I can dispatch men to assist you. But you know my circumstances—the Princess Consort would never allow me to go.”

Guan Yu frowned. Without Jiang Yuankai, the endeavor seemed futile. The East Sea Dragon Pearl was in his hands; what purpose would their journey serve if he remained behind? If the pearl indeed held the key to the treasure, his absence rendered their efforts meaningless.

“Brother Jiang, your presence is indispensable. Yet I have thought of a solution,” Guan Yu proposed. “If monstrous beings from the demon realm are drawn to the East Sea Dragon Pearl in the northern regions, then for safety’s sake, you could arrange for the Princess Consort and Princess Jiang Xin to seek refuge in the imperial palace. It would be far more secure than remaining here.”

Jiang Yuankai agreed. With his family safe, he could accompany Guan Yu to the far north. “Very well. But I must discuss this with the Princess Consort. If she consents, I shall join you on this expedition to the East Sea.”

“Excellent. Their safety is paramount. I am confident we shall reap great rewards. I need a few days to finalize preparations. Use this time to ready yourself,” Guan Yu said.

As Guan Yu prepared to leave the Prince Consort’s residence, Jiang Xin called out to him at the gates. “Wanhong, I wished to thank you—for saving Chu Fan.”

Guan Yu paused, surprised. “How did you know it was me? Did you witness it?”

“I did not. I surmised it,” Jiang Xin smiled. “Though Chu Fan himself is unaware, and I lack concrete proof, I know only you could have rescued him so seamlessly.”

“You overestimate me, Miss Duan. It was not my doing,” Guan Yu replied lightly. “Chu Fan claims his captors fell out with their employer, leading to his release.”

“Such simplicity is unlikely. Even if they quarreled, they would have killed him. Villains lack such mercy,” Jiang Xin countered. “Your slip just now betrayed you. By asking how I knew you saved him, you admitted it. Do not feign ignorance.”

**Chapter 5025: Perplexed**

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. Jiang Xin’s acuity was formidable. Her sudden query had caught him off guard, revealing the truth.

“Why are you so certain? Perhaps Chu Fan was merely fortunate,” he challenged.

“Who else would risk aiding him? You alone possess both the will and capability,” Jiang Xin insisted. “I came to express gratitude. Accept it.”

Guan Yu relented, realizing denial was futile. “Very well. But let this remain between us. A trivial matter need not be broadcast.”

“I do not understand your secrecy, but I shall heed your wish—even keeping it from Father,” Jiang Xin said. “Yet one thing puzzles me.”

“Ask freely. I owe you a favor, and now is as good a time as any,” Guan Yu offered.

Jiang Xin smiled. “That favor I shall reserve for a critical moment. My question is this: since you rescued Chu Fan, you must know who orchestrated his capture. Why have you revealed nothing?”

Guan Yu hesitated, stung by Chu Fan’s secrecy. “Why not ask Chu Fan himself?”

“I did. He feigns ignorance, claiming not to know his captors.”

“He knows. I am certain. But he withholds the truth, even from you. His lack of trust disheartens me. Though I know the full tale, his silence leaves me no recourse.”

Jiang Xin frowned. If Chu Fan knew yet refused to speak, even to her, what hidden motives drove him?

Guan Yu added, “Perhaps he is coerced or threatened. But to withhold from you… it baffles me.”

“I must confront him. His behavior is inexcusable,” Jiang Xin declared, though recent unrest had restricted her movements under her parents’ orders.

Guan Yu said, “Chu Fan is safe now. Let that suffice. The rest is beyond my concern.”

“And what of my safety?” Jiang Xin pressed. “If the culprit remains unknown, I remain in peril. Would you see me kidnapped again?”

Guan Yu conceded. The Qin family, having failed once, might target Jiang Xin next. Yet without proof—mere bandits’ testimonies held no weight—exposing them was perilous.

“Fear not. When evidence surfaces, I shall deal with them. They will not trouble you again,” Guan Yu vowed.

“I trust you. But act swiftly. I cannot endure another abduction,” Jiang Xin pleaded. Her trust now rested solely in Guan Yu and her father, for even Chu Fan had grown enigmatic.

Upon returning, Guan Yu arranged for Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi to accompany him. Though he intended to leave them at the Devil Soul Sect’s safehouse, they insisted on joining. Relenting, he settled them with Xiao Mei before returning alone to the Cloud Green Sect.

Elder Xuanming awaited him at Tiger’s Peak Hall, eager for news. Elder Lu accompanied Guan Yu, curiosity piqued.

“Guan Yu, what transpired in the capital? Word says many cultivators were expelled,” Elder Lu inquired.

“A long tale,” Guan Yu replied as they entered the hall.

Elder Xuanming, seated loftily, demanded, “Explain the capital’s turmoil.”

Guan Yu marveled at their ignorance—the sect’s isolation had left them uninformed, unlike the Devil Soul Sect’s efficient intelligence network.

“Master, the East Sea Dragon Pearl sparked the conflict. Its seekers kidnapped Princess Jiang Xin, the Emperor’s favorite, enraging him into ransacking the capital. Intruders later breached the palace, compounding chaos. Cultivators were exposed and expelled. Only Lord Zou’s favor spared me.”

Elder Xuanming nodded. “And the East Sea Treasure? Any progress?”

“Scant. Jiang Yuankai has scouts seeking clues, but to no avail. By chance, I met a survivor of the East Sea town. Our next step is to investigate its northern reaches—likely the true East Sea.”

“Excellent. Locating it brings us closer to the treasure,” Elder Lu remarked.

Elder Xuanming added, “On the Emperor’s birthday eve, celestial lights illuminated the capital—was it the Eight-Drum Technique?”

“No. Strange white powder fell like snow, gilding the palace, but the technique remained hidden. Perhaps a ruse by Patriarch Menghua,” Guan Yu speculated.

“With no sign in Miao City or the capital, the trail has gone cold,” Elder Lu sighed.

“I believe the Eight-Drum Technique ties to the East Sea Treasure. I seek your leave to pursue this lead,” Guan Yu declared.

Elder Lu questioned, “But where is this East Sea? Even we elders know no such place.”

“It is not a sea but a vast lake,” Guan Yu explained. “The survivor’s homeland lay in an isolated valley, now destroyed. He claims the East Sea lies in the far north—a land of endless winter where its waters never freeze.”

“Most peculiar,” Elder Xuanming mused. “Lakes freeze, yet this one defies nature. Investigate thoroughly.”

Elder Lu urged, “Make haste. Seize the advantage before others learn of it.”

Guan Yu added, “Another matter: after the northern floods, a cavern was discovered. At night, a colossal creature emerges, seizing people before retreating. A man-eating monster, perhaps?”

“A man-eater?” Elder Xuanming exchanged a grave look with Elder Lu. “Could it be…?”
