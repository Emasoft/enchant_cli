Guan Yu couldn’t help but freeze, staring at Li Xi as if she were a monster. Was this woman too clever? She had instantly pinpointed the crux of the matter. Moreover, her tone suggested she wasn’t the least bit worried about him.

He chuckled, neither confirming nor denying.

Having obtained the answer she sought, Li Xi fell silent, elegantly sipping from a glass of red wine. The crystal goblet lightly touched her thin vermilion lips as she tilted her head back, allowing the crimson liquid to flow smoothly down her throat. Her posture was so graceful, her demeanor so refined, that Guan Yu found himself entranced.

Even drinking exuded a bewitching allure—this woman was truly a natural enchantress. Any man would struggle to resist her magnetism.

After a small sip, Li Xi gazed at him and murmured, “Enjoying the view?”

Guan Yu nodded reflexively, then immediately realized his lapse, laughing awkwardly.

By the time they finished two glasses, Lin Lin’s silken laughter echoed through the room. Guan Yu knew Yang Yang had left in disgrace.

Lin Lin approached the table, downed a glass of wine, and sat down, casting a coquettish smile at Guan Yu. “Younger brother, you’re full of surprises! Making Yang Yang eat humble pie—you should’ve seen his face when he got that call. I nearly choked trying not to laugh. So satisfying!”

Giggling, she continued, while Li Xi remained composed, as if she’d anticipated this outcome.

“Younger brother, are you really a college student from the countryside?” Lin Lin still doubted Guan Yu’s background.

“Yes. Why?”

Though prepared, Lin Lin was stunned. A rural student had thoroughly humiliated two scions of military families and now sat here drinking unperturbed. No one would believe it if told. Yet her curiosity about Guan Yu deepened. She resolved to ask Li Xi more about him later.

The meal ended merrily. By the time they left, it was past eight. Lin Lin’s high spirits had led them to drink heavily. Li Xi’s face glowed rosy from the alcohol, adding a bewitching charm. Guan Yu, however, remained sober—he’d activated his healing system upon exiting, nullifying the wine’s effects.

With Li Xi in no state to drive, the task fell to Guan Yu.

“The night is young, younger brother,” Lin Lin slurred suggestively. “I’ll leave you and Xixi to enjoy its warmth.”

Guan Yu fled, fearing her seductive words would ignite untamed desires.

Though slightly tipsy, Li Xi guided him to her villa—his accommodation for the coming days. As they arrived, she stumbled on the staircase. Alcohol had dulled her coordination, and she teetered backward.

Guan Yu, right behind her, caught her in his arms. Even through winter layers, her body felt supple as willow tendrils. What would skin-to-skin contact feel like? Her delicate fragrance fueled his imagination.

Their eyes met. After a flicker of panic, Li Xi calmly stated, “Your hands. Would you mind moving them?”

Guan Yu blinked, then glanced down. His hands had instinctively cupped her breasts in the rescue. Worse, he’d reflexively tweaked her nipples.

“You—” Even Li Xi’s composure cracked. Her blush deepened as she glared.

Flushing crimson, Guan Yu hastily shifted his grip to her waist, helping her up. Though her intoxication had vanished, her piercing gaze pinned him like daggers.

“Misunderstanding!” He raised his hands placatingly. “Just preventing a fall! Cold pavement and all—”

“And the…squeezing?” Her eyebrow arched.

He froze. He’d assumed she’d avoid mentioning it. That this ice queen addressed it so bluntly shocked him. How to explain it was force of habit from fondling Du Xiaojuan and Liu Shilei?

Admitting that would mean sleeping outdoors. Yet recalling the sensation—soft yet firm, surely 36D—his traitorous mind wandered.

“Filthy thoughts?” Her voice turned arctic.

“N-none!” Cold sweat dripped down his back. Could she read minds?

“Shameless.” She spat the word, then strode inside.

Tail between his legs, Guan Yu followed, relieved she didn’t eject him.

Li Yuanshan awaited in the lit living room, rising with a warm smile. “Apologies for sending Xixi to fetch you. Urgent matters detained me.”

“No offense taken,” Guan Yu clasped his hand. “I should’ve contacted you sooner.”

“How’d you two get along?” Li Yuanshan asked casually.

Guan Yu glanced at Li Xi’s impassive face. “...Smoothly.”

Indeed—smooth enough for a man to trespass where none had in Li Xi’s 26 years.

Pleased, Li Yuanshan excused himself to bed, “accidentally” mentioning his sound sleep and encouraging them to “make themselves at home.” The subtext screamed: *Get together already!*

After he left, Li Xi headed to her room.

“Wait!” Guan Yu protested. “Your father said you should host me!”

Her lips curled. “What more do you want?”

Realizing the innuendo, Guan Yu groaned. “I’m not that kind of guy!”

“Aren’t you?” Amusement tinged her voice.

He gestured helplessly. “At least tell me where to sleep!”

“Follow me.”

Heart racing, he trailed her upstairs—only to be shown a guest room.

“This is yours.” She walked away.

Crushed, Guan Yu collapsed on the bed. High IQ women were terrifying adversaries.

As he plotted tomorrow’s confrontation with Lin Dong, a knock interrupted. No answer. Just as he turned to leave, the door opened—
