Guan Yu’s eyes lit up as he discovered Meimei had emerged completely unclothed. *Damn, this is divine.* Country folk who slept on heated brick beds rarely wore pajamas, and someone like Meimei preferred this primal state of slumber.

Shuangshuang grabbed Guan Yu’s arm and whispered a warning, “Handsome Brother, don’t go too far with my sister. Show some mercy.” Though Guan Yu could tell Shuangshuang’s words carried a hint of jealousy, he merely chuckled silently before returning to the bed.

“Give me your hand,” Guan Yu murmured to Meimei. He clasped her delicate fingers, intently tracing the joints with practiced focus. He did possess some skill in bone-reading.

Her hands lacked the silken softness of Shuangshuang’s, the skin roughened likely from years of farmwork.

His other hand wandered downward. Meimei tensed but remained silent—proof that girls secretly welcomed such advances unless their interests lay elsewhere.

To Guan Yu’s surprise, Meimei proved unexpectedly bold, already drenched with anticipation. She offered no resistance, reasoning she had nothing to lose and no witnesses to shame her. Why not indulge?

Just as Guan Yu lost himself in the moment, Shuangshuang interrupted, “Naughty Brother! How’s the fondling going? Finished yet?” Though her night vision faltered, she vaguely discerned Meimei writhing breathlessly beside him. Sensing trouble, she intervened.

“Uh… done, done.” Guan Yu halted abruptly. Meimei shot her sister a resentful glance, clearly unsatisfied.

“Well? What did you see?” Meimei whispered, her voice still unsteady from excitement.

Guan Yu feigned solemnity. “Your marital fate seems tolerable. Your husband will treat you well, but your life will remain ordinary. However… you might stray. Tread carefully—never let him discover it.”

“Nonsense!” Meimei protested, though his words planted doubt. *Would I truly cheat?*

Guan Yu smirked inwardly. *She’s already crossed that line tonight.*

Yet Meimei absorbed every word, retreating to bed in contemplative silence.

Privately, she rejoiced for Shuangshuang’s fortune in meeting such an extraordinary man. Guan Yu’s presence blessed both the girl and the Qu family. She prayed they’d unite. Tomorrow marked her own wedding, yet inexplicable dissatisfaction gnawed at her—now tainted by envy of her sister’s luck.

Restless, Shuangshuang imagined Guan Yu suffering on the hard bed. She slipped to his side, murmuring, “Eccentric Brother, let me keep you company. You’d be lonely otherwise.” Her conflicted heart raced.

In mere hours, she’d cycled through three nicknames: *Handsome Brother*, *Naughty Brother*, now *Eccentric Brother*—proof of her whimsical genius.

She resolved clearly: whether fate bound them forever or not, she’d cherish this moment without regret. “Eccentric Brother… do you want to touch me? Kiss me?”

*What’s this?* Guan Yu wondered. *A test?* He answered firmly: “Yes.”

“Then come.” Her face burned crimson as they entwined.

Dawn found Shuangshuang waking first. Gazing at her fiancé’s peaceful face, she smiled blissfully—until realizing his hand still cupped her breast, memories of last night flooding back. No regrets. This choice was hers, regardless of how many women might share his future.

Even if forever relegated to being his “intimate younger sister,” last night’s passion sufficed.

She leaned to kiss his cheek when noises next door signaled her parents’ awakening. Like a startled rabbit, she bolted to her own bed—just before her parents could discover them.

Her abrupt movement roused both Guan Yu and Meimei. Pale light seeped through the windows as roosters crowed outside.

Post-morning routines revealed Shuangshuang and Meimei bleary-eyed from sleeplessness, unlike Guan Yu who thrived on minimal rest.

Breakfast preceded a flurry of wedding preparations. Shuangshuang and Ling’er adorned cars with floral garlands while Guan Yu hung door couplets.

After hours of amateur makeup application—courtesy of the village’s sole “cosmetologist”—bridal Meimei emerged.

Firecrackers and gongs announced the groom’s arrival: a modest sedan followed by a chartered bus—luxurious by rural standards where tractors typically sufficed.

The groom’s eyes widened at the Bentley parked in the yard. Though clueless about cars, its opulence screamed wealth.

**Chapter 2245: The Arrival of a Master**

The groom’s confidence crumbled upon seeing Guan Yu, his self-worth dwarfed.

Guan Yu assessed the lanky, sun-kissed youth—decent-looking but overshadowed.

Post-ceremony formalities concluded, Guan Yu drove the bridal party, Shuangshuang gleeful about impending red envelopes.

The groom’s compound overflowed with fifty banquet tables. Yet all eyes swerved to Guan Yu’s arrival, women mobbing him with shameless proposals—some even offering to bear his children.

Shuangshuang shield-guarded his retreat until the Qu family declared him “reserved for their second daughter,” quelling the frenzy.

Inside the groom’s scarlet-decked home, the village chief’s daughter accosted Guan Yu: “Where’d you vanish last night? I searched everywhere!”

“Drank too much. Slept it off,” he deflected.

The joyous celebration ended. En route back, a tearful Shuangshuang begged to accompany him, only pacified by promises of future reunions after schooling.

Ling’er probed during their return: “Brother Guan, will you truly accept Shuangshuang?”

“If she wishes it, I won’t refuse.” Her charm and spirit captivated him.

Ling’er fretted about Shuangshuang integrating with his urban elite circle yet trusted Guan Yu’s kindness.

Exhausted, she napped as evening approached. Delivering her to Pan Tiansheng’s apartment, Guan Yu headed home—until Jones’ urgent call redirected him.

“Guan Yu! That junior sister’s causing trouble again—with backup!”

Rerouting, Guan Yu raced to Qing Bo’s residence where Jones and the poisoned elder struggled against Ma He—a First-Class Adept—and the shapeshifting junior sister.

**Chapter 2246: Hour of Reckoning**

Guan Yu’s shield flared white under Ma He’s crimson energy blast. The collision sent both men flying—Guan Yu smashing through a tree, bloodied but alive; Ma He nursing rebound injuries.

“Last time you fled. Not today,” Guan Yu taunted through gritted teeth.

Ma He sneered. “You think I’d run? Fool!” Gathering dark-red energy crackling with lightning, he unleashed a cataclysmic strike.

Guan Yu’s reinforced shield shattered on impact. Bones cracked as he skidded, barely conscious. Ma He loomed for the kill—but Guan Yu’s allies closed in. The battle’s tide would turn...
