Ma Tong examined the manual handed over by Wei Hongwei. He didn't mind the trouble—if these men truly weren't from the Yu Gang, then he'd wronged Guan Yu. He couldn't afford to offend such a formidable figure without cause. Squatting down, he scrutinized each face meticulously.

Three hundred-odd people proved too tedious, so Ma Tong summoned his assistant and Ju Niu (Giant Ox) to assist in the inspection.

Bill Lin and Fang Su grew increasingly uneasy. If these men weren't Yu Gang members, today's gambit had spiraled catastrophically out of control, and the consequences would be dire.

"We can't let this continue!" Bill Lin interjected. "Guan Yu, that scrap of paper proves nothing! Even if they're not Yu Gang, they're hired thugs you brought in to sabotage Boss Ma's casino!"

"If they're not my people, anyone could have hired them," Guan Yu retorted coldly. "By your logic, I could claim you sent them to frame me!"

"Preposterous!" Bill Lin snarled. "Boss Ma and I are close allies! Why would I target his own establishment?"

"You're a wolf in human skin!" Guan Yu shot back. "What wouldn't you do to entrap Boss Ma into your schemes? You orchestrated this casino raid to drag him onto your sinking ship, planning to use his forces as cannon fodder against me. Am I wrong?"

His precise accusations, delivered with conviction as if he'd witnessed the conspiracy firsthand, sent chills down Bill Lin's spine. Had Guan Yu anticipated their plot all along?

Fang Su's panic became palpable, his composure crumbling.

After ten minutes of scrutiny, Ma Tong consulted his subordinates: "Any matches?"

Both shook their heads. As Wei Hongwei returned with four ledgers, Guan Yu suggested, "Let me question these imposters, Boss Ma."

Wang Hu (Tiger) helped the battered ringleader up. "Who are you? Why impersonate Yu Gang members? Speak truthfully, and you'll live through the night."

Knowing the game was up, the man confessed: "We pretended to be Yu Gang for status. We're actually Sun Xu's men from the leather factory. Tonight at dinner, Xiao Mu from the seedling nursery approached us..."

Guan Yu interrupted: "Would you recognize this Xiao Mu now?"

"Even as ashes!" the man spat through broken teeth.

At Guan Yu's signal, two men dragged out a black tracksuited figure. Fang Su paled as the captive emerged. The ringleader lunged weakly, cursing: "Xiao Mu! You scheming bastard!"

Wang Hu released him as Xiao Mu trembled in the confrontation zone. Jia Bo had captured the fleeing conspirator during the casino chaos.

"Boss Ma," Guan Yu smiled, "question this man to uncover today's mastermind. Incidentally, shouldn't Sun Xu be at the Feng residence right now, Young Master Bill?"

Realizing the trap, Bill Lin and Fang Su froze as Ma Tong turned murderous eyes on them. The plan to manipulate Ma Tong as cannon fodder had spectacularly backfired.

Under Ma Tong's leather shoe, Xiao Mu's face scraped asphalt. "Talk, and live. Resist, and die. Who sent you?"

Blood pooled from the scalp wound. "Mercy, Boss Ma—" Xiao Mu begged before stiffening abruptly.

"He's dead!" Ma Tong roared, yanking open the corpse's jaw. No poison capsule—this was assassination. "Who dares? Show yourself!"

Though only a Third-Level Venerable cultivator, Ma Tong recognized the work of a hidden expert. Xue Jing (Silent Snow) had sensed the killer's qi fluctuation during the attack.

Guan Yu examined the corpse, extracting a sewing machine needle from the skull. The puncture oozed white foam as surrounding flesh necrotized. "A poisoned dart," he observed, cloth dissolving where it touched the toxin. "The trajectory came from your side, Boss Ma."

Bill Lin blustered: "You staged this! Your own men killed him!"

Guan Yu countered coolly: "The needle's path proves otherwise. Unless you imply Boss Ma lacks perception to detect attacks beside him?"

As arguments raged, Xue Jing maintained vigilant guard. The killer remained hidden, but the toxic needle's origin pointed to Bill Lin's faction—though neither he nor Fang Su possessed cultivation strength for such precision.

Ma Tong, realizing the assassin could have targeted him, prioritized survival over alliances. "Guan Yu—did you attack my casino?"

"Never." Guan Yu met his gaze steadily. "I avoid unnecessary conflicts. Your casino holds no interest for me."
