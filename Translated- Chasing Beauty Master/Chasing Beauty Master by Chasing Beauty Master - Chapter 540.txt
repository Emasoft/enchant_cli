“Younger Sister Luo Xi, what brings you here today?” Upon seeing Shao Siming (Young Fate Guardian), Luo Xi's voice softened considerably. Though they had always been close as sisters, their shared affection for the same man created an undercurrent of tension. Compared to Shao Siming's ethereal beauty, formidable cultivation, and prestigious status, Luo Xi couldn't help but feel overshadowed.

Yet Shao Siming seemed unperturbed. With a gentle smile, she replied, “Younger Sister Luo Xi, don’t misunderstand. I merely came to check on Young Master Guan Yu after hearing of his injury. What brings you here?”

“Just passing through. Nothing more.”

Guan Yu suddenly laughed heartily. “Now, what’s this? Weren’t you two the closest of sisters? Why this sudden formality?”

“It’s all because of you!” they snapped in unison.

Guan Yu could only offer an awkward smile, choosing silence over further provocation.

“Fine, I’ll take the blame. Happy now?”

“Speaking of which,” Shao Siming continued, “I heard from the Clan Leader that you and Guan Yu will be leaving the Elven Woods soon. Is this true?”

“Not for long. After all, Guan Yu isn’t one of our kind. He must return home eventually.”

“I see. But why wasn’t I told?”

Guan Yu glanced at Shao Siming, thoughts racing. *Why this sudden interest? Does she wish to join us?*

Her next words confirmed his suspicion. “Why not take me along?”

Though elated by her request, Guan Yu hesitated. His current strength couldn’t guarantee their safety beyond the forest’s protection.

Noticing his reluctance, Shao Siming’s composure shattered. Pouting like a wronged child, she cried, “Hmph! I knew you wouldn’t take me with you! All your sweet words were lies—I’ve been fooling myself!”

**Chapter 1367: Entanglements**

Guan Yu hadn’t anticipated such a visceral reaction. Before he could explain, Luo Xi intervened, gently taking Shao Siming’s hand. “You’ve misunderstood him, Shao Siming. He cares deeply for you—he speaks of you often!”

A flicker of hope lit Shao Siming’s eyes before she looked away. “You’re lying! He takes you abroad but excludes me. Some ‘care’!”

“Younger Sister Namei, enough of this childishness!” Luo Xi’s sudden use of Shao Siming’s true name startled both listeners. Guan Yu now recalled that “Shao Siming” was merely her title—her given name was Namei.

The breach of protocol shocked Namei. Among hierarchy-conscious elves, addressing superiors so familiarly was taboo. “How dare you!” she seethed, her pent-up frustration finding a target.

Guan Yu stepped between them. “Namei! Will you vent your temper on others simply because I denied your request? Continue this, and I’ll never take you anywhere!”

His words struck like daggers. Namei stood frozen before tears began their silent descent.

Instantly contrite, Guan Yu softened. “Namei, I spoke harshly. Let me make amends.”

Though she accepted his apology, tears continued. “I never meant to blame Luo Xi... I only wanted to tease her. But you... you both bully me!”

The formidable Fate Guardian had vanished, replaced by a vulnerable young woman.

Guan Yu sighed inwardly. *This is my own doing—meddling with hearts beyond my capacity to manage.*

“Lady Shao Siming,” Luo Xi pressed, “there are two reasons for his refusal. First, your duties here are vital. With our clan recovering from turmoil, your leadership is indispensable.”

Namei nodded reluctantly. Clan obligations weighed heavily, especially considering Patriarch Allen’s mentorship. “And the second reason?”

“He fears his current strength can’t protect us abroad.”

Relief washed over Guan Yu. *Finally, someone understands!*

Mollified, Namei met his gaze. “I see now. Forgive my earlier outburst. Luo Xi... when we’re alone, call me Namei.”

The tension dissolved, bringing the trio closer.

“By the way,” Namei inquired suddenly, “has Guan Yu mentioned his... other title? ‘Husband’?”

Guan Yu’s composure shattered. Luo Xi gasped. “Did he ask you to call him that?!”

At Namei’s nod, Luo Xi glared at Guan Yu. “How ambitious! Soon every woman in Lannai Continent will be calling you ‘husband’!”

“Don’t be absurd!” Guan Yu coughed nervously. “Most don’t even know me!”

“Wait,” Namei interjected, “why only women?”

“Oh you innocent child!” Luo Xi rounded on Guan Yu. “Preying on naive girls—how low! ‘Husband’ implies marital bonds. He craves that possessive thrill from countless women!”

Flushing crimson, Guan Yu stole glances at Namei, who remained ominously quiet.

**Chapter 1369: Seeking the Antidote**

As Guan Yu prepared explanations, a youthful voice echoed outside: “Bika Cat! What are you doing here?”

Amy bounded in, the magical feline in her arms. “Dragon Brother! Having a meeting?”

Luo Xi and Namei stifled laughter. “Indeed! We were just about to summon you.”

“Really? But I felt bored resting! Bika Cat wanted to see Dragon Brother!”

Namei studied the creature. “A ordinary cat, no?”

“He’s amazing!” Amy insisted. “Helped Dragon Brother defeat Locke yesterday!”

“A Tier Earth beast?” Namei’s eyes narrowed. “Equivalent to a human Sword King...”

Guan Yu intervened hastily. “Let’s celebrate later! Amy, you should rest more.”

Unheeding, Amy continued: “Bika Cat can talk!”

The room stilled. Under Namei’s probing stare, the cat finally meowed—then snapped, “Who’s a dead cat?!”

Guan Yu’s secret unraveled. Namei recognized the voice matching the “mysterious expert” from earlier. Though deceived, she found his motives endearing—even the “husband” moniker held reluctant charm.

As Bika Cat shamelessly flirted—“Hey gorgeous!”—Patriarch Allen arrived with entourage.

“Father!” Amy rushed over.

“We came,” Allen declared, “to discuss Guan Yu’s departure. Our clan owes you much. When do you leave?”

The unspoken question hung heavy—who would accompany him? Luo Xi? Namei? Or his cherished “little sister” Amy?

Guan Yu bowed. “No farewells needed. I’ll always consider this forest home.”

“Then know,” Allen vowed, “that while I lead, our gates stay open. Even when I retire, this shall remain!”
