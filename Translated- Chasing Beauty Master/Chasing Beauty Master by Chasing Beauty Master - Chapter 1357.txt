“Furthermore, nothing has actually happened between me and Siqi. It seems this girl still cares deeply about Guanyu deep down. Such intense jealousy clearly shows that. However, Guanyu’s woman must be broad-minded and capable of accommodating many things. A petty-minded woman could never stay with Guanyu. After all, if all women in Qiaoyuan District were narrow-minded, their constant scheming against each other would eventually lead to life-threatening dangers over time.

It appears I need to clarify with Siqi when there’s time – a good man doesn’t belong to any single woman.

Wang Xiaorong never expected there existed such a shameless woman who completely disregarded propriety. However, considering she herself had been pursuing Guanyu for quite some time while he maintained an ambiguous attitude, it seemed he was bewitched by this woman before her.

Xiaorong was an extremely confident person. To exaggerate slightly, the line of men wanting to be with her could stretch from here to the Mo Hun Sect. Yet ordinary people couldn’t tolerate her mischievous young mistress temperament. To be with Guanyu, she had completely discarded her status in his presence, yet he still wouldn’t accept her.

Now she finally understood – Guanyu was being enchanted by this woman. No wonder he remained indifferent to her. With such a beautiful girl following him around all day, and for not too long either, of course he wouldn’t have the mind for other women.

‘For a woman to possess such thick skin and shamelessness – you’re truly unmatched. In this aspect, I admit defeat.’ Xiaorong’s words were sharp as daggers, as if aiming to slay her opponent with tone alone. ‘Let me make this clear – don’t project your own vulgarity onto others. I’ve come to Guanyu on serious business. If he refuses to see me and major matters are compromised, don’t say I didn’t warn you.’

Chapter 3509: Numerical Superiority

‘You brought this upon yourself. Don’t accuse us of bullying with numbers!’ Siqi retorted mercilessly.

Xiao Zhi and Aze ceased giving quarter. They reasoned that the demonic sect had likely already entered Duobao Mountain through the rockery. With slim hopes of seizing the Eight-Sided Drum technique, capturing the young master of Mo Hun Sect to exchange for the technique from the Demon Lord seemed a viable alternative.

Though this approach bordered on inhumane, observing decorum with demonic sects at this critical juncture would be foolish. Mercy towards them meant cruelty to themselves.

Having decided, Xiao Zhi produced his bronze lock while Aze brandished his calligraphy brush. The confrontation teetered on the brink of violence.

Guanyu suddenly appeared at the doorway, shouting: ‘Hold your hands! I only stepped out briefly – what happened here?’

Feigning ignorance, Guanyu asked curiously: ‘Are you fighting? Using magic indoors – aren’t you afraid of collapsing the building?’

‘Guanyu! Where were you? I came looking for you.’ Xiaorong, who had been preparing to counterattack, immediately forgot her opponents upon his appearance, bouncing over to cling to his arm.

‘Guanyu, I truly came for you. Who knew these three would try to gang up on me?’ Xiaorong complained while shooting a vindictive glance. ‘Look at them – doors closed late at night, who knows what they were plotting? They only attacked because I interrupted.’

‘Lies!’ Siqi hastily retracted her magic, explaining: ‘Don’t listen to her nonsense, Guanyu. We weren’t doing anything.’ She wondered why she felt such urgency to explain – Guanyu had only been gone briefly. Surely he wouldn’t misunderstand.

‘Can everyone calm down?’ Guanyu said soothingly to ease Siqi’s worries. ‘Xiaorong, I just left here moments ago. They couldn’t have been doing anything improper. Don’t overthink.’

‘Oh? Is that so? I don’t know when you left. All I know is no one answered despite my prolonged knocking.’ Xiaorong retorted defiantly, uncaring whether Guanyu believed her. There was nothing to lose either way.

Seeing Xiaorong clinging happily to Guanyu’s arm, Siqi’s fury erupted. Pointing her jade scepter at Xiaorong, she declared: ‘Today, it’s either your death or mine! Since we’re fundamentally opposed, let’s settle this now!’

‘Wait! Everyone calm down and talk properly!’ Guanyu interjected, approaching Siqi. ‘I don’t believe her claims. Don’t I know your character? She’s just being mischievous – why lower yourself to her level?’

Though irritated by Guanyu defending Siqi, Xiaorong recognized her disadvantage as a lone demon sect member against multiple opponents. It was wiser to avoid conflict and simply take Guanyu elsewhere rather than engage further.

For a young girl’s heart to refrain from scheming and maintain magnanimity was already commendable.

‘Oh, I was only joking! Look how grim you all are – treating me like some mortal enemy?’ Xiaorong laughed disarmingly. ‘Alright, everything I said was in jest. Don’t take it seriously.’

Guanyu found this response pleasing. While expecting the Yunqing Sect members to back down first, this girl had preemptively defused the situation. A satisfied glance at Xiaorong noted her lack of overt jealousy compared to Siqi.

Unconsciously, Guanyu realized his partiality leaned towards Xiaorong.

With matters thus settled, Siqi couldn’t reasonably prolong the conflict without risking Guanyu’s disapproval. No harm had been done, after all.

Xiao Zhi similarly felt relief – Guanyu’s arrival promised peaceful resolution. Avoiding conflict was wisest, especially with numerous demon sect members outside. The outcome of real combat remained uncertain.

Siqi pressed: ‘Guanyu, why would this demon sect member seek you at night? How did she even know your room location?’

Guanyu detected interrogation and lingering jealousy in her tone. Siqi clearly suspected past private meetings between him and Xiaorong.

This questioning put Guanyu in a difficult position. Xiaorong’s youthful forbearance contrasted sharply with Siqi’s persistent suspicions, slightly disappointing him.

‘Siqi, I don’t know how she knew my room. But as half the Qin residence houses demon sect members now, isn’t it natural she’d find out?’ Guanyu replied wearily.

Xiao Zhi interjected: ‘The information likely came from Steward Sun. Regarding Qin Manor’s demon sect elements, he’d be the most informed.’

‘Steward Sun?’ Xiaorong inquired curiously. ‘You mean the old fox?’

‘Old fox? When that fox demon takes human form, it’s a youth,’ Aze corrected. ‘Shameful that a Mo Hun Sect member doesn’t even know her own subordinates.’

In truth, Steward Sun was the aged fox Xiaorong mentioned – grandfather of the white fox rescued by the Demon Lord. After recovering at Mo Hun Sect, the white fox recently reconnected with his grandfather, who came to express gratitude. Though aware of Mo Hun Sect’s demonic alignment, the fox clan maintained distance from human affairs. However, persuaded by the Demon Lord and wishing to repay his grandson’s rescue, the elderly fox agreed to assist.

Chapter 3510: Maintaining Composure

The fox grandfather-grandson pair agreed to help the Demon Lord in repayment, leading the elder to disguise himself as Steward Sun infiltrating Qin Manor to investigate Duobao Mountain.

Xiaorong chuckled: ‘What you don’t know is – the white fox is the old fox’s grandson. Your Steward Sun is the elderly fox. At his age, isn’t he old enough?’

Only now did Guanyu learn this, realizing Xiaorong could provide more demon sect intelligence – precisely why he dared not offend her. Otherwise, he might have let the fight proceed, knowing the trio would overpower Xiaorong.

His intervention aimed to prevent unnecessary conflict while exploiting Xiaorong’s usefulness.

Siqi’s orthodox mindset differed: ‘Guanyu, how can you shield this demon sect member? We’re righteous sect members – fundamentally opposed to them. All demons deserve death. If we don’t act now, when shall we?’

Perhaps largely motivated by jealousy, Siqi’s hostility seemed excessive. Xiao Zhi and Aze bore no hatred – Xiaorong had never harmed them, even risking herself to help rescue Xiaotong at Black Snow Ridge. They owed her gratitude, making violent expulsion distasteful.

Guanyu hadn’t expected Siqi’s immaturity and disobedience. ‘Siqi, calm yourself. She’s aided us multiple times. Though our paths differ, how can we treat benefactors so?’

‘We shouldn’t expel, but politely see her out.’ Guanyu urged, hoping Siqi would prioritize the bigger picture.

Feeling wronged yet unwilling to air internal discord publicly, Siqi suppressed her grievances.

‘I didn’t come for them anyway,’ Xiaorong declared, ignoring others as if only Guanyu existed. ‘Let’s go somewhere fun, Guanyu!’

‘Patience,’ Guanyu countered. ‘Your demon sect plans to enter Duobao Mountain via the rockery tonight. How could I have leisure for outings?’

‘You knew?!’ Xiaorong laughed in surprise. ‘Impressive, Guanyu! Mo Hun Sect kept this extremely covert, yet you discovered it.’

‘Since you know, why hasn’t Yunqing Sect sent reinforcements?’ She inquired, noticing no other sect members present.

Guanyu smiled: ‘To handle Mo Hun Sect, our four suffice. Why involve others to hinder us? Don’t you agree?’

‘Our four?’ Xiaorong repeated quizzically before realizing Guanyu included her in ‘we’. Alarmed, she demanded: ‘What are you planning? Don’t think I’ll lead you into Duobao Mountain! Absolutely not!’

‘How clever you are – already grasping my intent. We’ll trouble you for guidance later.’ Guanyu smiled meaningfully.

Only then did Xiao Zhi and Aze relax, admiring Guanyu’s strategy. Retaining Xiaorong served practical purposes.

Siqi’s anger dissipated upon realizing Guanyu prioritized the greater good. With numerous demon sect members present, their group’s safety would be ensured by having Xiaorong – the Demon Lord’s daughter – as hostage.

‘This is no joke, Guanyu!’ Xiaorong refused. The Eight-Sided Drum technique was crucial to her father. Sabotaging this would bring severe consequences regardless of her status.

Though mischievous, Xiaorong understood gravity. ‘I won’t betray Father.’

‘Very well. If you insist, we’ll proceed alone.’ Guanyu waved dismissively. ‘No time for leisure. You may leave – we’ll enter regardless.’

Xiaorong wondered how they obtained this intelligence – perhaps the old fox slipped. Regardless, without her assistance, they’d still find a way.

Guanyu sat calmly: ‘Truthfully, even without you, we’d stop the demon sect. Our delayed action lets your people trigger Duobao Mountain’s traps first, clearing our path.’

Chapter 3511: Pitiable

‘So cunning, Guanyu!’ Xiaorong exclaimed in realization. Pioneering Duobao Mountain’s dangers indeed favored later entrants.

Guanyu’s curiosity turned to the foxes. Though rare, powerful figures often kept magical beasts. ‘Does the Demon Lord keep fox demons as long-term subordinates?’

‘Correct. After all this time together, you didn’t know Steward Sun’s identity?’ Xiaorong saw no harm in revealing this.

‘I recognized the young fox’s inhuman aura,’ Guanyu admitted. ‘But Steward Sun concealed himself perfectly.’

‘He’s the white fox’s grandfather. They serve Mo Hun Sect to repay Father’s life-saving grace, not as pets.’

‘I see.’ Guanyu nodded. ‘Remarkable creatures, these fox demons.’

‘Cleverness doesn’t equate to power.’ Xiaorong recalled teasing the white fox at Mo Hun Sect despite its intelligence.

Attempting deterrence, Xiaorong warned: ‘Guanyu, Mo Hun Sect brought numerous experts with Left Envoy commanding. Your four stand no chance – why court death?’

‘We know better than direct confrontation.’ Guanyu replied evenly.”
