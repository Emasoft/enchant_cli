“Die…” Five longswords viciously stabbed toward Liao Yuntian from all directions. Individually, these moves seemed unremarkable, even riddled with flaws. Yet combined, these ordinary strikes had driven Liao Yuntian into a fatal dead end.

“Clang…”

A purple spirit sword descended from the heavens, splitting into seven phantoms. The five Spirit Severing stage cultivators were instantly sent flying. In that split second, three died while two were injured. Seizing the moment, Liao Yuntian erupted into motion, kicking one wounded cultivator so fiercely the man crashed lifelessly to the ground.

“Heh. These coordinated tactics for commanding same-level cultivators aren’t something ordinary people learn. Speak—who are you?” Guan Yu stared coldly at the youth. He seemed to have caught an extraordinary figure. Perhaps this one would yield unexpected gains.

“Cough… Don’t kill me! I’m the grandson of the Yin Kui Sect’s Grand Elder! I… I have value!” Fear flashed in the boy’s eyes. Barely in his teens, death felt utterly alien. Facing it now, he realized how terrified he was—how desperately he wanted to escape it. He’d pay any price to survive.

Chapter 1176: The Yin Kui Sect’s Might

“Oh? You want to live? Then shouldn’t you offer something worthwhile? What value justifies sparing you?” Guan Yu smiled. This intentionally spared youth indeed held value, with an identity exceeding expectations.

The Yin Kui Sect’s dominance within the demonic factions was universally acknowledged. Yet this “might” remained abstract—manifesting in myriad ways while its true depths stayed veiled. Guan Yu realized this was a golden chance to unravel the sect’s current strength.

“Swear not to kill or torture me. Otherwise, I’ll say nothing.” The youth regained some color in his face. The fact Guan Yu hadn’t struck yet meant his worth was recognized.

“Clever lad. This isn’t the place to talk. If you value your life, follow me. Don’t attempt escape… unless you crave death.” Guan Yu chuckled. This youth showed promise—fearing death wasn’t inherently weak.

Who could face mortality with perfect calm? That this boy rationally sought survival amidst terror marked uncommon mettle. With a wave, Guan Yu lifted Bao and swiftly departed.

The entire ambush concluded before the demonic factions could react—five Golden Core experts and nearly thirty Spirit Severing cultivators eradicated in twenty minutes. Even Guan Yu marveled at their improbable success.

Back at his villa, after treating injuries on himself, Bao, and the others, Guan Yu led the youth to his study. Knowing one’s enemy was half the battle—he urgently needed intel on the demonic factions’ true state.

“Speak. I trust you know what information can buy your life.” Guan Yu smiled amiably. The boy’s life meant little to him—but obstinance would earn a swift end.

“I’m Yin Qianji. My grandfather is Yin Wuming, the Yin Kui Sect’s Grand Elder. Since you spared me, you want insider knowledge. I’ll talk—you’d learn this eventually anyway. But how will you ensure my safety?” Now bathed and dressed casually, Yin Qianji sat opposite Guan Yu with composed elegance.

Demonic factions boasted millennia of tradition. Their bearing and conduct carried inherent dignity—far from the bloodthirsty savages outsiders imagined. Without refinement, who would join them?

“I, Guan Yu, hereby vow: If Yin Qianji conceals nothing, I shall spare his life without torture.” Guan Yu solemnly swore.

For ordinary folk, such oaths meant nothing. But cultivators’ vows resonated with Heaven’s Dao—breaking them invited tribulation lightning without exception. Hearing this, Yin Qianji visibly relaxed.

“The Yin Kui Sect has recuperated fifty years since the Great War where demonic and orthodox factions united against foreign invaders. Our lost elites have been replenished. The sect has one Sect Master at late-stage Transcending Tribulation—though he’s been secluded since my birth. True authority lies with eight Elders.” Yin Qianji paused to sip tea, organizing thoughts.

“If you’ve resolved to speak, discard reservations. I won’t reveal you as the source. After this, I’ll release you—as if we never met.” Guan Yu smiled. When betraying, hesitation needed crushing—no retreat allowed.

“Worry not. Once decided, I never waver. Truthfully, the sect’s internal strife means much I know is conjecture.” Yin Qianji’s smile held no deceit.

“In demonic factions, strength reigns supreme—Elder rankings reflect this. Our Yin Clan is called the sect’s foremost family. But our influence now extends beyond borders. Interested?” Yin Qianji’s words startled Guan Yu—demonic reach spanned overseas?

“Details, the more the better. If your foreign ventures stay abroad, I’ve no objections. Perhaps we could even collaborate.” Guan Yu grinned, inwardly bitter.

Demonic factions were scapegoated as chaos-sowers. Yet orthodox vs. demonic conflicts were ultimately struggles of doctrine and interest. Stripped of moral pretenses, demonic Three Sacred Sects proved more visionary than hidebound orthodox sects—expanding globally while orthodoxy stagnated domestically.

Even isolationist orthodox clans like Kunlun grew arrogantly deluded, severed from modern society.

“Over decades, our Yin Clan holds countless foreign corporate stakes—engaging and clashing with overseas divine/demonic forces. Domestically, I’ll provide our commercial holdings list. Regarding cultivators: Our Yin Clan boasts two Transcending Tribulation experts, twelve Unity stage, thirty Soul Division, fifty-nine Soul Projection, over a hundred Nascent Souls—thanks to extended lifespans post-Nascent Soul. Golden Core and Spirit Severing cultivators? Too numerous to count.” Yin Qianji’s calm voice chilled the study.

Chapter 1177: Potential Collaboration

“Yin Qianji… brother Yin, you jest! This is just one demonic clan? What of the other seven Great Families? With such power, demonic factions could’ve crushed orthodox sects long ago. Why lie low?” Guan Yu’s eyes flashed fear. These numbers weren’t just terrifying—they defied reason. Why would such might contest barren mortal lands?

“Guan Yu—that’s your name, yes? Demonic cultivation is easy early but hard later. Orthodox sects’ top experts outnumber ours. Plus, with Kunlun’s presence, what demonic dare wreak havoc in Central Plains? Unless they court death?” Yin Qianji shrugged—these figures seemed unremarkable to him.

Cultivation meant defying heaven, stealing lifespan. Post-Foundation Establishment, lifespan slightly increased with disease resistance. Spirit Severing cultivators typically lived 200 years (in qi-rich environments). Golden Core—the mortal/immortal divide—granted 300-year lifespans, yet many stagnated here.

Nascent Soul marked another watershed, drastically extending life. Such experts formed a sect’s foundation. Millennia of accumulation bred these numbers.

“My ignorance shows. Perhaps I know too little of high-level cultivators. If demonic factions are this strong, the orthodox ‘Demon-Suppression Campaign’ must be smoke and mirrors—both sides tacitly train juniors.” Guan Yu sighed. New to cultivation, he knew little of demonic depths—or even his own Baiyun Temple’s hidden strength.

“Exactly. My grandfather sent me to temper myself. The mortal world has become successor proving grounds. Achievements here are key for gaining elder favor. Guan Yu, you’re no zealot. What if I said we could collaborate?” Yin Qianji’s eyes glinted cunningly—his true aim emerged. With safety assured, he probed Guan Yu’s limits.

“Collaborate? Elaborate.” Guan Yu’s interest stirred. No orthodox dogmatist, he cared not for stale “good vs evil” dichotomies. His goals: protect loved ones, gain benefits, pursue immortality. Rules? Mere games for the strong.

Chapter 1178: The Wives Dilemma

“This trial released heirs from every major family. My Yin Clan alone sent seventeen grandsons abroad—three others are here besides me. I want you to eliminate them.” Yin Qianji smiled, voicing his desire.

Guan Yu gaped. Such demonic ruthlessness! Regardless of rivalries, these were his kin!

Perhaps Guan Yu—raised mortal—could never truly become one of them. Cultivators’ hallmark was cold pragmatism. Competing with heaven and man was natural. Beyond close kin, all were expendable.

Killing required no reason—mere whim sufficed.

“This request… needs consideration. Why approach me?” Guan Yu awkwardly asked. Though mortals had similar villains, this was his first encounter.

Guan Yu cherished kin and comrades. Hearing such fratricide proposed casually shocked him.

“Why? Hah! You think finding me was luck? My location leaked—they sold me out! Waiting nearly doomed me. Since you’ll hunt them anyway, why not gain an ally?” Yin Qianji laughed. He’d expected Guan Yu to be shrewd—now found him almost endearingly naive.

“Demonic folk are terrifying—discussing kin-slaughter so lightly. Such bloody strife…” Guan Yu shook his head. No wonder demonic factions thrived—survivors of this Darwinian forge were exceptional.

“Don’t delude yourself. Orthodox sects do the same—just covertly. Not voicing vileness doesn’t purify it. The demonic-orthodox difference? We’re naked; you wear pants.” Yin Qianji sneered. Righteous vs. wicked? A meaningless distinction.

“Enough! I care not for moral debates—I’m a worldly man, no paragon. If collaboration benefits both, I’m amenable. But cross me, and…” Guan Yu grimaced, cutting off the topic. His bottom line mattered—not empty labels.

“Directness suits me. Intelligence will flow your way. May future collaborations follow.” Yin Qianji relented. Truth bored Guan Yu—only mutual gain interested him.

Watching Yin Qianji leave, Guan Yu felt unease. While risks seemed minimal—no “colluding with demons” stigma if careful—something felt off. Unable to pinpoint it, he teleported to Fumou Sect’s mountain to meditate.

After nightly cultivation, clarity returned. A neglected truth surfaced—lifespan.

Rapid advancement and youth had blinded him. His wives’ situations struck hard. Even Zhou Xiaoyou, strongest among them, barely reached Fusion stage—vulnerable without Baiyun Temple’s protection.

Though cultivation couldn’t be rushed, Fumou Sect’s mountain offered new possibilities. An idea ignited—could ordinary people cultivate?

“Vajra, if I wanted ordinary folk to cultivate… is there a way?” Guan Yu tentatively asked. Modern cultivation demanded resources and youth. But perhaps…
