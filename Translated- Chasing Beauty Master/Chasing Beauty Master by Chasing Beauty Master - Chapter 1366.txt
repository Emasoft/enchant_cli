The multicolored luminous stone embedded in the wall was indeed the mechanism's trigger. Any contact with it would activate hidden traps.

Chapter 3534: The Hallucinogenic Mist

Wang Xiaorong accidentally triggered the mechanism. A thick cloud of soul-narcotizing mist surged forth – not lethal but capable of inducing hallucinations. Severe exposure could shatter one's consciousness, reducing victims to babbling fools.

Fortunately, Guan Yu reacted swiftly. Everyone immediately sat cross-legged in meditation, holding their breath. Guan Yu followed suit, sinking to the ground to circulate his spiritual energy against the poison.

The creeping mist seemed endless, its sluggish movement barely stirred by faint air currents. Siqi had inhaled a wisp during her momentary distraction. Now dizziness overwhelmed her as the world spun wildly.

While maintaining his energy circulation, Guan Yu vigilantly scanned their surroundings. This vulnerable state invited ambush. His sharp eyes noted Siqi's restlessness amidst the others' calm composure.

Leaping to her side, Guan Yu pressed his palm against her back. "Your mental defenses are weakening," he muttered, channeling pure spiritual energy into her meridians.

Suddenly, white light flooded his vision. Guan Yu found himself standing in a tranquil village where a mud-smeared girl played near a thatched hut. Though dirt-streaked, her innate nobility shone through the rustic setting.

"This must be Siqi's childhood," Guan Yu realized, though the vision's purpose remained unclear.

The girl called to a middle-aged woman, "Mother! I'm going to Miaomiao's house!"

"Return before lunch," the woman answered tenderly.

Following the child, Guan Yu arrived at a dilapidated temple beyond the village gates. Dark clouds suddenly blotted the sky as black-robed figures descended upon the settlement. Guan Yu recognized these hirsute assailants – Blackhair Fiends from the Bloodridge Clan.

"Where is the incense burner?" they demanded, slaughtering villagers who hesitated. Soon flames engulfed the screaming community.

"Mother!!!" The child-Siqi's anguished cry pierced the air as she lunged toward the inferno. A Blackhair Fiend raised its clawed hand, only to be intercepted by a descending figure – Elder Dai from Cloudspire Sect.

"Beasts!" The elder thundered. "I'll end your atrocities!" Though he slew several fiends, the village burned to ashes.

The vision shifted. Now-adult Siqi stood in Cloudspire robes clutching the jade ruyi Guan Yu had gifted her. "They killed my mother! Everyone deserves death!" she screamed, eyes turning obsidian as fangs sprouted from her mouth.

"Siqi! This is an illusion!" Guan Yu shouted. "Break free from your inner demon!"

"You murdered my family!" The possessed Siqi attacked with unnatural strength, her jade ruyi whistling through the air. Guan Yu dodged frantically, unwilling to harm her true soul within this mental realm.

Drawing his Soulfall Blade, he parried while pleading: "Remember our mission! I'm Guan Yu! Fight the corruption!"

When her assault faltered at his name, Guan Yu struck a precise blow to her occiput. As she collapsed, he channeled purifying energy into her meridians to expel the demonic influence.

Chapter 3535: Awakening

Siqi stirred in Guan Yu's arms, eyes clearing. "What... happened?"

"You inhaled hallucinogenic mist," he explained gently as others began rousing. "The danger has passed."

Xiao Zhi stretched lazily. "Strange – I dreamed during meditation!"

Wang Xiaorong's eyes narrowed at seeing Siqi embraced. "Shameless! Sneaking affection while we–"

"Enough!" Guan Yu's rebuke silenced her. "Your recklessness nearly killed Siqi!"

The chastened girl mumbled, "I didn't mean... Her poor concentration–"

"Apologize properly!" Guan Yu's anger surprised them all. "We're a team. One mistake endangers everyone."

After tense moments, Siqi intervened: "What's done is done. Let's proceed."

The group backtracked through winding tunnels, eventually discovering a gilded chamber filled with corpses – some fresh, others ancient. Golden furnishings glittered with gemstones, yet death hung thick.

"Bloodridge and Monstrous Den forces," Guan Yu analyzed. "Poisoned during their greed-driven struggle. This isn't Meng Hua's true vault."

Chapter 3536: Change of Course

Xiao Zhi eyed the riches hungrily. "Shouldn't we search–"

"Those who touch these treasures die poisoned," A'ze countered. "I value my life."

Retracing their path, the group chose the alternate tunnel marked by Guan Yu's earlier symbol. The downward slope grew cooler, distant water sounds replacing volcanic rumbles.

"An underground lake?" Guan Yu mused as moist air brushed their faces. New dangers awaited in the echoing darkness.
