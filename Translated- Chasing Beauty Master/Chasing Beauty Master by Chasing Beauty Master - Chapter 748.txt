Guan Yu chuckled nonchalantly, “Do you think I’d fear him?” Chen Tianxiao, seeing Guan Yu’s pretentious expression, burst into laughter alongside him.

Chapter 1897: The Giant Ape

The awaited match between LanZhe Academy and LinYuan Academy commenced first. Though Guan Yu remained unfamiliar with the participants’ names, Chen Tianxiao knew them well.

The opposing teams had finished drawing lots, and the first bout began promptly. Two male students stepped into the arena. Since their uniforms bore school insignias, their affiliations were clear even to strangers.

Chen Tianxiao explained to Guan Yu, “That LinYuan Academy contestant is Zhang Xi (Practiced One), a Middle Three Venerables cultivator. He’s long been LanZhe’s top talent.”

Guan Yu nodded silently. Zhang Xi’s evident superiority left little doubt about the match’s outcome.

True to expectation, within rounds Zhang Xi had his opponent scrambling across the arena before securing victory. LanZhe Academy triumphed over LinYuan three to one. Next came KaiHuang Academy versus Century Garden Academy, with opponents again determined by lottery.

Chen Tianxiao, restless, volunteered to draw first. Upon opening his slip, he grimaced at the name “Ge Yinglai (Heroic Shadow)” and shook his head ruefully at Guan Yu.

A Lower Three Venerables against an Upper Three Venerables—a near-hopeless matchup. Yet Chen Tianxiao, ever the martial fanatic, relished challenging stronger opponents and resolved to fight wholeheartedly.

As both entered the arena, Guan Yu gaped in shock. Ge Yinglai was not only a woman but a hulking Westerner whose rotund frame rivaled Wei Hongwei’s, standing over 1.8 meters tall. Her massive physique seemed capable of engulfing Chen Tianxiao whole.

Guan Yu’s eyes narrowed. Ge Yinglai’s cultivation path relied on her corpulent body to absorb attacks before countering. This flesh-based defense likely enabled her Upper Three Venerables status—her blubber could withstand strikes from peers. However, discovering her vital weakness might permit Chen Tianxiao’s victory despite their disparity.

When Ge Yinglai lumbered to the center, spectators gasped collectively. Her sheer presence radiated dominance, contrasting starkly with Chen Tianxiao’s utterly ordinary appearance. All leaned forward, anticipating spectacle.

“Begin!” declared the referee.

The combatants shook hands—Ge Yinglai’s paw-like mitt nearly matching Chen Tianxiao’s foot in size. Guan Yu noted her disproportionally long arms, lending her a gorilla-like silhouette with limbs outstretched.

Chen Tianxiao struck first, a palm blade aimed at her eyes. Ge Yinglai lazily raised a forearm to block. The crisp *smack* left her unscathed. Guan Yu observed: conventional attacks would fail against her defenses. Only pinpointing her qi gate—the vital weakness inherent to body cultivators—could turn the tide.

Ge Yinglai swung a tree-trunk arm unexpectedly fast for her bulk. Chen Tianxiao barely dodged, backflipping to flank her. She retaliated with a stomp he evaded by leaping three meters back.

Realizing attrition favored her, Chen Tianxiao unleashed qi projectiles, forcing Ge Yinglai back yet leaving her unharmed. As she parried blows with armored forearms, she suddenly roared, her skin flushing crimson. Abandoning defense, she charged.

Chen Tianxiao retreated under relentless assault, finding respite only when circling her left flank—her noticeably clumsier side. Strikes to her heart and armpit proved futile until Zhang Han (Little Grace), munching snacks nearby, piped up: “Uncle-in-law! That fatty’s left leg’s hurt!”

Guan Yu’s eyes lit up—the weakness lay in her left sole! But before he could signal, Ge Yinglai smashed Chen Tianxiao meters away, knocking him breathless. The referee awarded her victory amid thunderous applause.

“Found her weakness?” Guan Yu asked post-match. Chen Tianxiao sighed, “Her left foot’s sole. But reaching it’s impossible.”

Next, Zhang Han bounded into the arena, stomach stuffed with snacks. She cheekily asked the referee, “Can I pick two opponents?” Denied, she drew Feng Jiawei (Lofty Excellence)—a relief for Guan Yu, ensuring KaiHuang’s likely victory.

“Fengs won’t face you today,” Chen Tianxiao remarked. Guan Yu sneered, “His luck. I’d have hospitalized him like Feng Shao.”

Feng Jiawei leered at Zhang Han during their handshake attempt. She chirped, “Uncle-in-law says no shaking hands with creeps!” Laughter erupted as she suddenly kicked his elbow, exploiting his distraction.

“Cheating brat!” he spat, clutching his arm.

“No rules against crushing perverts!” she retorted, pummeling his face relentlessly. “Take that! And that! Stop ogling!”

“I yield! I yield!” Feng howled, shielding his head. Zhang Han pranced triumphantly, earning roaring cheers.

With scores tied 1-1, Guan Yu volunteered next. Feigning lot-drawing, he swapped slips to ensure facing Cao Jin (Golden Talent). The crowd hushed as both masters entered the arena.

After a cordial handshake, Cao Jin unleashed a sky-rending palm strike. Guan Yu drifted aside like smoke, the attack cratering the steel arena walls.

Zhang Han’s impish tactics continued, battering Feng Jiawei’s eyes until surrender. Her victory spurred deafening applause, boys cheering loudest for the adorable victor.

Chapter 1899: Playfighting

As Guan Yu faced Cao Jin, spectators scarcely blinked. Ah Mei (Little Beauty) peeked through fingers, praying silently. Cao Jin’s profound gaze hinted at fathomless cunning, yet Guan Yu smiled disarmingly, ready to dismantle his defenses.

The real battle had just begun.
