Though labeled as a pervert by the female officer, Hou Jinshun moved to intercept the two bodyguards advancing toward her. However, Guan Yu halted him with a subtle glance.

The burly thirty-something male officer, despite his imposing demeanor, reacted to the Heilonghui members' aggression not by drawing his weapon, but by bolting for the exit while shouting, "Officer Wang, retreat!"

Doll-faced Officer Wang displayed remarkable composure. Rather than firing at her assailants, she inverted her pistol and smashed its grip against one bodyguard's dagger while executing a sidekick that snapped the wrist of the second attacker with an audible crack.

Witnessing her fluid movements, Guan Yu inwardly applauded: *Impressive!*

The metallic clang of a blade hitting the floor mingled with agonized screams as the disarmed bodyguards recoiled. Before they could regroup, Wang yanked Meng Fancheng into a chokehold, pressing her firearm to his temple. "Assaulting officers? One move and this pretty boy's brains decorate the wall!"

Guan Yu chuckled, "A petite officer calling him 'pretty boy'?"

Wang shot him a withering glance. "I'm no delicate flower. Before spineless peacocks like you, I'm the matriarch!"

With their master subdued and recognizing Wang's superior combat skills, the bodyguards surrendered. After cuffing them, Wang approached Guan Yu and Hou with jingling restraints.

**Chapter 1679: Handcuffed**

Grinning at the doll-faced officer, Guan Yu teased, "Arresting us too, little miss?"

Wang retaliated with a sharp kick to his shin. "Address me as Officer or Wang Manqing! Call me 'little miss' again, and I'll bunk you with those thugs. Let's see how you fare against three."

Though amused, Guan Yu noted Wang's extraordinary speed—her takedown of Meng's pseudo-supernatural bodyguards surpassed even Hou Jinshun's capabilities.

Outside, converging vehicles announced new arrivals: a police cruiser and a Hummer disgorging seven tattooed Heilonghui enforcers. The senior officer, Xu Zhengran, confronted their leader: "Meng Jingang! Does Heilonghui fancy itself above the law now?"

Meng sneered, "Investigate properly, Captain Xu. We taxpayers fund your salaries. My son lies injured—apprehend the culprits, or expect formal complaints."

Xu seethed silently, aware of political pressures shielding Meng's "legitimate businessman" facade. As he pushed past, Meng Jingang blurred through police lines—a pseudo-supernatural whose aura rivaled third-tier mutants.

Inside, Meng Jingang's roar shook the restaurant: "Incompetent worms! Who harmed my son?"

The trembling bodyguard pointed at Hou and Wang. Scanning the trio, Meng initially dismissed them—until sensing their latent power. "Since when do police recruit such talents? And that one?" He glared at Hou.

An underling whispered Hou's bartender identity, deepening Meng's frown. Xu interjected, "Officer Wang, explain this situation."

"Assault and police obstruction," Wang declared, eyeing Meng defiantly. "Recommend intensive interrogation—sunlight emboldens roaches."

Meng masked his unease. "My son requires medical attention. Ensure justice, Captain, lest higher authorities inquire."

After Meng's strategic retreat, Guan Yu and Hou found themselves cuffed in a patrol car. Guan Yu rattled the cage: "I have classes! Need to inform my teachers!"

Wang turned, feline grin flashing pointed canines. "Professor Sun Xiaoya and Liu Shilei would excuse their pet student, no?"

Guan Yu grimaced—they'd thoroughly investigated him. This "doll" hid vulpine cunning.

**Chapter 1680: Not a Child**

"Feigned innocence disgusts me," Guan Yu muttered as Wang's laughter tinkled upfront.

"Questioning my credentials?" he pressed. Behind him, the Heilonghui thugs strained to eavesdrop until twin kicks silenced them against the window.

Xu admonished, "You're in custody! No vigilantism!"

Guan Yu countered, "These leeches bleed civilians dry. Your precious law coddles them while justice starves."

Wang clapped approval. "I crave being a righteous knight, not this bureaucratic puppet! But address me properly—I'm no 'little miss'!"

"Given my... seniority," Guan Yu smirked, "the term fits."

Wang brandished imaginary scissors. "Old goat masquerading as student! If my man strayed like you're chasing that teacher—*snip*!"

Hou interjected, "Your skills—pseudo-empowered or mutant?"

"Neither!" Wang preened. "Through rare herbs, ancient martial artists now match third-tier mutants. I'm our family's prodigy—sent to clean Y City's supernatural underworld."

At the precinct, instead of cells, they received coffee in an interrogation room. Guan Yu eyed the steaming cups. "What's the price of this hospitality?"

Hou pushed his away. "Charge me with battery, fine. Don't enlist me as your attack dog."

Xu exhaled smoke. "Consider your drug peddling history. And Heilonghui's retaliation."

Guan Yu scoffed, "Protecting gangsters now, Captain?"

"Enough!" Wang interceded. "We need allies against Heilonghui's mutant affiliates. Your... extracurricular talents interest us."

**Chapter 1681: Collaboration**

The stale air thickened with unspoken bargains. Wang leaned forward, all traces of playfulness evaporated. "Heilonghui's experimenting with enhancement serums—creating unstable pseudo-supernaturals. We need eyes inside their labs."

Guan Yu swirled his coffee, the liquid mirroring his calculating gaze. "And if we refuse?"

Xu produced a dossier. "Hou's narcotics history. Your... irregular academic records. Alternatively, classified clearance and resources."

Outside, neon signs flickered to life as nocturnal schemes unfolded. Somewhere, a serum brewed, its secrets poised to tip Y City's fragile balance. The game commenced.
