“Whatever monstrosity you are, as long as I’m here, you’ll never run rampant! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless!”

“Count me in too! Don’t think spouting a few human words makes you impressive. You think I was born yesterday?”

Though their words rang bold, a faint tremor betrayed their bravado. Clearly, these men weren’t truly fearless—they merely sought to posture before the crowd and women.

Guan Yu nearly laughed aloud. How absurd these mortals were, trembling inwardly yet puffing themselves up for pride’s sake. Did they not realize such posturing might cost their lives?

His chuckle drew venomous glares from nearby men. “Keep laughing! Once we catch that demon cat of yours, we’ll deal with you properly. If you can still smile then, we’ll let you go!”

Town Chief Bard shouldered through the crowd, barking, “Enough prattle! Capture that fiendish cat now! Fifty gold coins to whoever succeeds!”

At the promise of reward, fear dissolved into greed. As the adage goes: Where gold glitters, bold hearts stir. The hesitant found purpose as rowdier men spurred them onward.

Guan Yu watched the chaotic cat-hunt unfold without concern. He knew Bikao’s capabilities intimately—the seemingly frail creature could match his own combat prowess. With its petite frame and lightning reflexes, capturing it would prove impossible for these amateurish villagers. This farce would only end in exhaustion.

Freed from worry, Guan Yu focused on the wolf-woman. Though he’d witnessed lycan strength firsthand, her fluctuating energy signatures defied his spiritual perception, forcing constant vigilance. Danger could strike unseen.

The wolf-woman met his gaze, abandoning her earlier damsel act. She stepped forward, halting ten paces away. “Who are you? Why oppose me?”

“Your pack sought trouble first.”

Her puzzled reaction confirmed ignorance of his clash with Wolf Tianhua—an advantage he’d exploit.

“Nonsense! Why would we target strangers?”

“When have I ever crossed your path? Do you know my name?”

“I... don’t.”

“Precisely. Would your vaunted War Wolf Mercenary Corps remain ignorant of past enemies? Your hierarchy prides itself on intelligence.”

“I still don’t trust you.”

“Trust matters not. Heed this—being a wolf-woman grants no privilege here. Before me, you’re insignificant. Your life hangs by my whim.”

The wolf-woman fell silent, her usual arrogance crumbling beneath Guan Yu’s palm—where violet flames flickered. Only Sword King-level cultivators wielded such fire. That this youth possessed such power shook her profoundly.

“Impossible! Some trickery!”

“Test me then. My blade thirsts for blood.”

Fear outweighed pride. Though resentment burned, survival instinct prevailed. Sensing her hesitation, Guan Yu hatched a plan.

“Your name?” Guan Yu asked abruptly.

The wolf-woman eyed him warily. “Why should I tell you? You haven’t shared yours.”

“Guan Yu. Now you.”

“Did I promise reciprocity?” she retorted.

Rather than anger, amusement stirred in him. “No matter. I’ll discover it myself.”

Her face paled. “What... what do you intend?”

“Tsk. So easily frightened? I’ve manners with ladies.”

“Lecher! Stay back!”

“Call me lecher again, and I’ll play the role properly.” His grin turned wolfish. “Earlier slander demands compensation.”

“Harm me, and the War Wolf Corps will hunt you down!”

Rage flashed in Guan Yu’s eyes. “That name seals your fate.” Their sheltering of Locke and schemes against the Spirit Forest still rankled.

“Stay back! I’ll scream!”

“Who’ll heed you?” He gestured where villagers fled Bikao’s playful shocks—tiny currents sufficient to fell grown men. Cries of “Monster!” echoed through streets.

“Useless worms!” she spat. “All bluster when danger comes.”

“Ordinary folk lack your training. Their courage extends only to impressing beauties.”

Her demeanor shifted abruptly. Sidling closer, she purred, “Did you call me... beautiful?”

Guan Yu shrugged. “A polite address. Don’t flatter yourself.”

Crimson flooded her cheeks. “You—!”

“Boss, quit flirting!” Bikao bounded over. The villagers cowered meters away, thoroughly cowed.

“Impatient furball.” Guan Yu’s gaze swept the wolf-woman’s form. Despite her vicious nature, youth’s bloom lingered—enough to flush her under their scrutiny.

“Scoundrels! Die!” She lunged wolf-quick, claws raking air as Guan Yu and Bikao dodged effortlessly. Blue flames kindled in his palm—a playful warning.

As combat loomed, Chief Bard interposed himself. “Fear not, maiden! I’ll protect you!”

The wolf-woman instantly transformed—head bowed, hands twisting hem. “Oh Chief! They mean me harm!”

“None shall threaten my town!” Bard puffed out his chest. “My word here is law! They’ll regret crossing—”

His speech died as she twisted his arm behind his back.

“Wrong move, fool.”

“This... this is mistake! We’re allies!”

“Is it?” Her feral grin chilled his blood.

**Chapter 1396: Bard’s Retribution**

“Release me! My reputation—”

“Reputation?” She laughed cruelly. “Pray for your life instead!”

Bard summoned azure flames—pitiful Sword Apprentice level. “Last warning, wench!”

“You’d strike me?” Her mock fear fueled his bravado.

“Wind Slash!” A blade of air whistled toward her—easily sidestepped. Panicking, Bard launched another attack from behind.

*Thud!* The strike rebounded harmlessly. Her pained grimace outweighed by Bard’s terror.

“Mercy! I erred!” He groveled. “Spare me!”

Guan Yu watched coldly. Such cowardice unfit for leadership. This incident might cleanse the town’s corruption.

“Help!” Bard pleaded to his tormentors. “Save me!”

But salvation wouldn’t come—not from the man whose eyes now blazed with purifying purpose.
