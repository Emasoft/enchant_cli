Contemplating this, Guan Yu felt somewhat certain that Manor Lord Lu was indeed a monstrous being, though what kind of creature he was remained unclear. The Demon Sovereign should have persuaded such a being with kind words to become his subordinate. Why would he launch a full-scale attack on Tiger’s Maw Manor? This was the point Guan Yu couldn’t fathom. Even if Old Sun Fox had died, finding Miao City again shouldn’t be too difficult. If they wanted the Profound Fire Stone, sending a few experts would suffice. Why stir up such a commotion? Guan Yu suspected there must be other hidden reasons.

Overall, whether Manor Lord Lu was good or evil remained unclear. Guan Yu had never heard of him before, yet everything felt too coincidental. They had just arrived at Tiger’s Maw Manor when the Soul Demon Sect decided to attack—as if it had all been premeditated.

Guan Yu stood up to take a walk. Outside, he saw Xiao Zhi approaching. “Guan Yu, where are you off to?” the latter asked.

“Oh, just restless. Couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d stroll around,” Guan Yu replied.

Xiao Zhi said, “Elder Martial Brother and I met Manor Lord Lu again. We informed him of your condition—that you can’t use magic temporarily. Since you won’t be able to cast spells when the demonic sect attacks, we’ve decided to send you to a safer location.”

“What? Where are you planning to send me?” Guan Yu asked irritably.

Xiao Zhi pointed east. “Thirty miles from here lies a small town where Manor Lord Lu relocated the elderly and children from Tiger’s Maw Manor. After discussing with Elder Martial Brother, we think you should recuperate there until this conflict is resolved. We’ll fetch you afterward.”

“I’m not going,” Guan Yu retorted. “Do you really take me for some feeble invalid? Am I so weak? Even without magic, must I be shipped off? If enemies come, I can at least run!”

“Guan Yu, this is for your own good—”

“Enough. I refuse. If you think I’ll be a burden, I’ll stay confined to my room. I won’t use magic. Satisfied?” Guan Yu snapped.

Though aware of Xiao Zhi’s good intentions, Guan Yu found the plan infuriating. Being lumped with the elderly and children felt worse than death. When Xiao Zhi tried to speak again, Guan Yu cut him off: “Spare your words. I’m not as useless as you think. Even without magic, my inner energy remains. Ordinary foes can’t harm me.”

Xiao Zhi suddenly recalled Guan Yu’s dual cultivation of martial and mystical arts. Chuckling, he said, “Ah, I’d forgotten your capabilities after your injury. Of course this trivial matter means nothing to you, haha!”

Patting Guan Yu’s shoulder, he added, “Let’s explore the manor. I’m curious about Tiger’s Maw’s defenses.”

**Chapter 3756: Won’t Tell You**

“Good idea,” Guan Yu agreed, eager to verify Manor Lord Lu’s claims about the western defenses.

Meanwhile, Yan Zhao sulked in his room, annoyed by Manor Lord Lu’s lack of hospitality. Assigning individual rooms was insufficient—where were the gifts? The silver for entertainment? The waiting maidens? If no offerings arrived by nightfall, Yan Zhao resolved to confront the manor lord directly. Without incentives, why bother defending against the Soul Demon Sect?

As Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi toured the manor, the latter remarked, “Hardly any elderly or children here. Did Manor Lord Lu really evacuate them all? Could the Soul Demon Sect truly attack?”

“How should I know their plans?” Guan Yu grumbled.

“Tsk. Aren’t you close with Wang Xiaorong, the Soul Demon Sect’s young mistress? Didn’t she tell you anything?”

Recognizing the tease, Guan Yu played along: “She did reveal their battle strategies. But I won’t tell you. What then?”

Instead of rising to the bait, Xiao Zhi laughed. “You’re bluffing. Why would they disclose secrets to you?”

“Fine, you win.”

At Tiger’s Maw’s western gate, massive walls over six meters high loomed, guarded by soldiers. After identifying themselves as Cloud Azure Sect disciples, the guards respectfully allowed them atop the battlements. The thick walls spanned three meters wide. Beyond lay sloping plains dotted with trees—ideal terrain for an invading force.

Guan Yu wondered if Wang Xiaorong would appear in battle. What would he do if they crossed paths?

In a teahouse, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi overheard patrons discussing rumors. A bearded man claimed Manor Lord Lu had once supplied a hundred monstrous beings to the Demon Sovereign in exchange for a cultivation artifact. Guan Yu’s suspicions deepened—if true, aiding Lu became questionable.

“That beard might be spreading lies,” Xiao Zhi whispered. “Defaming the manor lord here? Reckless.”

“Not necessarily,” Guan Yu countered. “The details ring true. I’ve suspected Lu is a monstrous being himself—how else procure so many? Normal humans couldn’t capture that many alive.”

Xiao Zhi paled. “Then our coming here was a mistake! This is demonic sect infighting—none of our concern!”

Guan Yu shrugged. “We needed supplies regardless. Coincidence brought us here. My guesses may not be far from truth.”

**Chapter 3757: Setting an Example**

Returning to discuss with their elder martial brother proved futile. “Yan Zhao cares little for justice,” Guan Yu noted. “His mind’s elsewhere.”

Indeed, Yan Zhao presently bargained with Manor Lord Lu over unoffered “amenities.” When summoned to dinner, he lied about his companions’ whereabouts: “My juniors sought entertainment—men have needs, you understand.”

Manor Lord Lu apologized for his oversight, failing to provide female companionship earlier. Yan Zhao’s gaze lingered on a young maid as he pontificated: “As their elder, I must set a proper example.”

The manor lord praised Yan Zhao’s uprightness, unaware the disciple mentally undressed the servant. Yan Zhao’s lecherous display aimed to prompt Lu’s compliance—a tactic that worked.

**Chapter 3758: A Drink**

Observing Yan Zhao’s barely concealed lust, Manor Lord Lu sighed internally. Even righteous sect disciples wore masks. The maid in question—fresh to the manor—remained untouched by Lu himself. Yet for strategic gains, he’d sacrifice her.
