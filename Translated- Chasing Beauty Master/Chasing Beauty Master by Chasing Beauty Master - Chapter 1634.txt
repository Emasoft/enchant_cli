Guan Yu shook his head and said, “That’s not necessarily true. Consider this—even if clothes, flesh, and bones could be reduced to ashes, shouldn’t there be some distinguishing marks on Lord Zhang’s person? For instance, silver coins he carried would never burn away. Or perhaps jade pendants, jewelry—such items could prove Lord Zhang died here.”

Wang Jun found this reasoning sound. At minimum, they needed to first confirm Lord Zhang had perished in the flames here, then find witnesses to prove the Imperial Guards had set the fire. With that, matters would become much simpler. Without delay, the three began carefully sifting through the debris.

Prince Zou had slept poorly all night. Rising early, he sat in his chambers as Zou Wuqi brought in a basin of hot water for his morning ablutions.

**Chapter 4260: How to Carry On**

While a lowly soldier could provide testimony, offering overly detailed explanations would seem unnatural—exceeding the capabilities expected of his station.

Yu Shu pondered before asking, “Very well. Can you tell me how we might find this so-called evidence? How do we confirm the Imperial Guards killed Lord Zhang?”

Wang Jun realized he had spoken too freely and deliberately retreated: “The fire consumed the main hall. Surely traces remain at the scene. Beyond that, this humble one knows not what to do.”

In truth, Guan Yu had already discovered evidence in the scorched ruins earlier, but it held no value to him. Presenting it to the Imperial Guards would prove futile—they’d likely dismiss or destroy it outright.

Now circumstances differed. The Elite Guard had arrived, clearly intent on investigating this matter to deal a severe blow to the Second Prince. Thus, Wang Jun chose to share this lead.

Yu Shu found the logic sound. With the scene largely undisturbed, clues must exist. He pressed further: “When Lord Zhang burned to death, did you not find remains? Death should leave traces.”

Wang Jun deliberately remained silent. Over-speaking risked complications—better let others voice explanations.

As anticipated, another soldier spoke up: “We dared not investigate the scene without authorization, awaiting our superiors’ return for instructions.”

“The scene remains untouched? Excellent.” Yu Shu waved to his subordinates. “Come with me to inspect the site.”

Seizing an opportunity, Wang Jun notified Xiao Zhi outside to urgently inform Guan Yu. The Elite Guard contingent arrived at the charred hall.

Yu Shu ordered, “Search thoroughly. Look for clues without disturbing the evidence.” Turning to Young Master Zhang, he added, “While Lord Zhang’s fate remains unconfirmed, evidence shall dictate our conclusions. We will uncover the truth—please accept our condolences.”

Young Master Zhang still refused belief. How could his formidable father perish so abruptly? His entire livelihood in Bajia City depended on his father’s influence—without it, how would he maintain his arrogant swagger among the city’s elite?

Moreover, his rivalry with Kyoto’s young nobles hinged on paternal prestige. Should Lord Zhang truly be dead, the youth couldn’t fathom how to sustain his way of life.

Xiao Zhi rushed back to the inn, reporting to Guan Yu: “The Elite Guard investigates thoroughly. Wang Jun says it’s time to return those two maidservants.”

Guan Yu nodded pensively. “I won’t go. Take them back yourself. Speak truthfully without concealment—hand them to the Elite Guard. Monitor their movements closely. We can’t reveal all our cards yet.”

“Understood. But will their testimony hold weight before the Elite Guard?”

“Absolutely,” Guan Yu affirmed. “Unlike the Imperial Guards who’d silence witnesses, the Elite Guard will protect them if genuinely seeking justice. Their treatment of these maids will determine our trust in them.”

Xiao Zhi escorted the maids back to the magistrate’s residence, instructing them to freely testify before the Emperor’s investigators. To avoid suspicion, he coordinated with Wang Jun for their seamless reintroduction—presented as Wang’s discovery.

**Chapter 4263: Counterfeit Wine**

Guan Yu turned to Wang Xiaorong curiously. “A woman’s intuition?” Privately, he shared her suspicion—the Elite Guard’s actions clearly aligned with the First Prince’s designs against the Second Prince. Simultaneously targeting Prince Zou seemed overambitious. “Perhaps this overture bears sincerity. We should inform Prince Zou and let him decide.”

Wang Xiaorong worried: “Visiting the Prince now risks exposure. What if they mean him harm?”

Though aware of dangers, Guan Yu insisted: “This requires the Prince’s judgment.” Devising a discreet communication method, he later strolled through streets with Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi, deliberately attracting surveillance.

Approaching evening, they entered a pawnshop. Guan Yu purchased a gold bracelet for Qiqi and jade bangle for Wang Xiaorong before “stumbling upon” a tavern—actually a Demon Soul Sect front.

Their boisterous entry drew attention. Guan Yu theatrically spat wine, bellowing: “What swill is this? Tastes like water! Fetch your manager!”

When the drenched waiter fetched the manager, Guan Yu threw a coin purse containing a hidden message. The manager discreetly delivered it to Zou Wuqi.

**Chapter 4264: Inadequate Capability**

Reading the note, Prince Zou mused: “The Elite Guard has concluded investigations. The First Prince seeks audience—claims sincerity. Should we trust this?”

Zou Wuqi cautioned: “Could this be the Second Prince’s trap? The First Prince was always considered foolish—does he truly oppose his brother?”

“Never underestimate Consort Guifen’s influence,” the Prince countered. “Her enduring rivalry with the Second Prince proves her cunning. Tell Guan Yu I’ll meet the First Prince only after the Imperial Guards’ condemnation becomes official. Let them destroy each other first.”
