Xue Jing smiled at Jia Bo and said pointedly, “I heard you have a special relationship with Xie Yulu. If you can keep her at this table, wouldn’t that solve everything? Just follow Brother Wei’s example.”

The crowd watched Jia Bo’s predicament with amusement, but he knew the truth—Xie Yulu, that lovesick fool, became a nervous wreck whenever Guan Yu was around, too intimidated to stay. Thankfully, she at least had the sense to keep her distance.

Wei Hongwei decided not to tease Jia Bo further, knowing he might face retaliation later when Guan Yu wasn’t around. Standing abruptly, Wei bellowed, “Everyone quiet! Listen up!”

The room fell silent, chopsticks paused mid-air as all eyes turned to him.

“Each table appoint one person to collect everyone’s phone numbers and bring them to me. I’ll transfer money directly. If your phone can’t receive payments, mark ‘cash’ and I’ll deliver it personally. Understood?” he roared.

The promise of cash had everyone scrambling. Within minutes, nearly fifty slips piled before Wei Hongwei. As Yao Yao assisted with the logistics, the atmosphere buzzed with festive energy—until Guan Yu’s phone rang with an unknown number.

Recognition flickered. “Ah, Fang Ding,” Guan Yu answered casually. “To what do I owe this honor, Miss Fang? We’re hardly acquainted.”

“Enough chatter,” snapped Fang Ding. “Where are you? We need to talk.”

The Fang family’s precarious position weighed on her. With Guan Yu holding their secrets, they remained vulnerable despite frantic efforts to conceal their misdeeds. After agonizing deliberation, she’d resolved to negotiate—preferably through financial settlement, but other means if necessary...

“Business with me?” Guan Yu feigned ignorance, well aware she sought the damning recordings from Gao Bing—evidence explosive enough to skin the Fangs alive if exposed.

“Meet me at the westside construction site—our usual spot,” he said breezily before hanging up.

Fang Ding hesitated, unnerved by the background noise suggesting a crowd. She’d proceed cautiously.

“A guest may arrive soon,” Guan Yu announced, placing beef in Xue Jing’s bowl. “When she does, mind your manners and follow my lead.”

“Don’t worry, Boss! We won’t embarrass you!” Jia Bo thumped his chest.

The growl of a Lamborghini’s engine drowned the revelry moments later. All heads turned as the supercar’s door opened, revealing a statuesque beauty whose presence outshone the luxury vehicle. Fang Ding froze momentarily—accustomed to corporate galas, not this raucous underworld gathering. A hundred eyes pierced her composure, but years of aristocratic breeding held her posture erect as she glided toward Guan Yu.

A Yu Gang member barely restrained his whistle. “Hey gorgeous, wanna drink?” died on his lips under the boss’ warning glare.

“Miss Fang,” Guan Yu gestured magnanimously, “join us. You must be hungry.”

She tilted her chin. “I don’t dine with your sort in dumps like this. Nor do I eat trash.”

Jia Bo slammed the table, rising. “Who the hell do you think you are? The boss is being polite! Know your damn place!”

Guan Yu waved him down, amused. “We lowlifes aren’t worthy of high society’s company. Yet here you are. Why?”

Fang Ding’s hauteur couldn’t mask her purpose. “This concerns sensitive matters. Must we discuss them publicly?”

“These are my sworn brothers. Speak freely or wait until we’re done.”

Her cheeks flushed. “Fine. I’ll wait.” She retreated to her car, slamming the steering wheel. “That bastard! Making me air family secrets before his thugs! Just you wait, Guan Yu...”

Laughter trailed her exit. “Carry on!” Guan Yu cheered. “Plenty of time!”

He relished her humiliation. Such arrogance demanded regular correction—a few whip strokes to enforce compliance, lest insolence fester.

When Fang Ding later attempted to leave, Guan Yu texted: *Return now if you want to talk. Our party might end abruptly.*

Gnashing teeth, she U-turned. “As you command,” her reply read.

Jia Bo gawked. “Boss! How?!”

“Natural talent,” Guan Yu smirked, pocketing his phone.

The revelry stretched past midnight. Only when the last stragglers departed did Guan Yu approach Fang Ding’s car. She emerged, sleep-rumpled and seething. “Finally free, *Boss*?”

“Speak. My brothers here are family.”

“Name your price for Gao Bing’s recordings. All copies. And if leaks occur afterward...”

“Threatening me?!” Jia Bo lurched drunkenly.

Her slap never landed—Xue Jing intercepted mid-swing. “Strike him,” the fighter warned, “and you won’t walk out.”

Fang Ding recoiled, regrouping. “Your men lack discipline.”

“They’re spirited,” Guan Yu countered. “State your offer.”

“Every recording. No backups. What’s your figure?”

“Substantial. The information’s... voluminous.”

As negotiations tensed, Xie Yulu erupted elsewhere, brandishing a bottle at Jia Bo’s ear. “Learn to flirt?! I’ll teach you!”

Guan Yu mediated, charm disarming the spat. By 1 AM, only core members remained.

“Well?” Fang Ding pressed.

“Let’s discuss numbers...” Guan Yu began, the real bargaining about to commence.
