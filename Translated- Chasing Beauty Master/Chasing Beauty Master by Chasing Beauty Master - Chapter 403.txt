“The Jade Master, upon hearing the couple’s story, hesitated for a long time before finally carving a counterfeit jade into an imperial seal to present to the emperor. The genuine jade was polished into this Heart of Jade.”

“Later, the emperor discovered the truth, killed the Jade Master and the young couple, then seized the Eternal Heart?”

Guan Yu interjected from the side.

“Darling, you’ve heard this story too?” Wenqing asked.

“Who hasn’t heard such a melodramatic cliché? Isn’t this how all TV shows play out?”

Guan Yu curled his lip. The moment Lin Lin began speaking, he had guessed the ending and found it utterly predictable.

“Could you let me finish?!” Lin Lin shot him an exasperated glare. “The ending is somewhat similar to your guess, but with a twist. The Jade Master was indeed killed, but the young couple chose to take their own lives!”

“Suicide?” Guan Yu blinked, surprised by this detail.

“Yes, suicide! After obtaining the Eternal Heart, the couple was overjoyed. But just then, the emperor’s men arrived. By that time, the wife’s life was already at its end. Instead of fulfilling her dying wish to surrender the jade, the husband chose to commit suicide. With his last breath, he spat blood onto the jade… See that crimson infusion within the stone? Legend says it was stained by the blood of both husband and wife.”

Following her words, Guan Yu examined the jade. At its core lay a faint crimson hue, nearly imperceptible unless scrutinized closely.

“They say whoever possesses the Eternal Heart will be united eternally with their beloved. Darling, let’s buy it!”

“Of course!”

Guan Yu agreed casually. If Wenqing desired it, he would procure it at any cost.

However, Lin Lin interjected, “This jade won’t be easily acquired.”

“Why?”

“Can you identify what type of jade this is?”

Guan Yu shook his head silently.

“Have you heard of He’s Bi? Rumor claims this piece was crafted from its remnants. Though mere fragments, its value remains incalculable.”

*He’s Bi?* Guan Yu scoffed inwardly. If it truly originated from that legendary jade, even his entire fortune might fall short. But this piece… *Hmph.*

With a cold chuckle, he assured Wenqing, “Don’t worry, my love. I’ll secure it for you!”

Around them, the crowd stirred eagerly, clearly aware of the jade’s storied provenance.

**Chapter 109: The Fierce Bidding**

“The jade’s history needs no elaboration. Let the bidding commence! The starting price is 10 million, with increments no less than 1 million!”

To emphasize the artifact’s significance, Hu Zongze personally took the stage as auctioneer.

“11 million!” A bid echoed instantly.

“12 million!”

“13 million!”

…

“16 million!”

The fervor escalated rapidly, yet Guan Yu withheld his paddle. In truth, the wealthiest bidders—including Li Bing and Young Master Li—remained silent.

“Brother Bing, won’t you buy that jade for me?”

The Eternal Heart’s allure proved irresistible to women like Liu Wenwen, who clung to Li Bing’s arm. Though affluent, Li Bing winced at spending tens of millions on mere jade. Still, to save face, he bid 20 million, knowing higher offers would inevitably follow.

The moment he placed his bid, Guan Yu raised his paddle. “25 million!” He then tossed Li Bing a taunting glance, igniting the latter’s fury.

*Damn show-off! Can you even afford such a sum?* Li Bing seethed internally.

Previous bids had climbed in modest increments, making Guan Yu’s leap startling. The auction hall buzzed as attendees turned to identify the audacious bidder. Recognizing Guan Yu, whispers rippled through the crowd.

Li Yu, observing the scene, asked Young Master Li, “Don’t you desire this jade?”

“Desire it? I’m determined to claim it!” Young Master Li replied. The symbolism of He’s Bi was not lost on him, though he anticipated fierce competition.

“Then why refrain from bidding? If no one surpasses 20 million, Guan Yu will win it!” Li Yu fretted, loathing the prospect of Guan Yu’s victory.

“If this jade were truly worth 20 million, Hu Zongze wouldn’t auction it. The major families haven’t yet stirred. Wait—the final price will astonish us all.”

As predicted, a voice declared, “30 million!”—a leap of 10 million.

Guan Yu turned to see a young man in his twenties. Their eyes met briefly, the stranger’s gaze flickering with amusement before he nodded.

“Who is he?”

Attendees of this gala were no ordinary folk, and a 30-million bidder surely hailed from a prominent mercantile or political dynasty.

Lin Lin shook her head blankly. Despite her Beijing roots, the city’s uppermost echelons remained beyond her ken.

Guan Yu frowned, realizing his intelligence network in the capital was woefully inadequate. Had this bidder been an enemy, the oversight could prove perilous.

Bids surged relentlessly, reaching 120 million. One bidder glared at Guan Yu with undisguised hostility.

“150 million!” Song Qifeng announced.

Noticing Li Xi beside him, Guan Yu’s expression darkened.

“Odd… Didn’t XiXi plan to visit Taiwan today?” Lin Lin murmured, equally puzzled by Li Xi’s presence.

“200 million!” Guan Yu countered.

Silence engulfed the hall. Two hundred million was no trifle, and many deemed it exorbitant for a jade artifact.

“Darling, let’s abandon this. It’s too costly…” Wenqing pleaded softly, uneasy at the extravagance.

Guan Yu patted her head wordlessly. He knew Hu Zongze wouldn’t relinquish the jade easily.

“250 million!” Song Qifeng upped the ante, glancing at Li Xi. *No woman could resist such a treasure,* he mused.

“300 million!” Young Master Li finally entered, escalating directly to 300 million.

“400 million!” The earlier young man rejoined.

“500 million!”

“600 million!”

“700 million!”

“800 million!”

New bidders emerged—strangers to Guan Yu, at least two radiating animosity. The rest, though cordial, offered no allyship given Guan Yu’s contentious reputation in the capital.

By now, only Guan Yu, Young Master Li, and a few scions remained in the fray.

800 million—a sum beyond lesser clans.

“800.1 million!” Guan Yu lazily raised his paddle.

The crowd gaped. Increments had leapt by millions, yet here he added a mere 100,000. Was this a jest?

Guan Yu sneered inwardly. *Fools. Your tears will flow soon enough.*

“800.2 million!” the young man parried.

“800.3 million!” Young Master Li called.

Murmurs arose. If Guan Yu seemed mischievous, these two—bound by status—wouldn’t dabble in farce.

“900 million!” A long-faced youth bid, then smirked at Guan Yu.

Noticing him, Guan Yu shrugged. “900.1 million!”

“1 billion!” The long-faced youth pressed.

Now only they dueled.

“1.01 billion!”

“1.1 billion!”

“Very well. At 1.1 billion, the jade is yours!”

Guan Yu withdrew, startling his opponent.

“Y-you’re stopping?!” The youth stammered, unprepared for this retreat.

“Spending 1.1 billion on a worthless rock? Who’s the fool here? Enjoy your prize!”

**Chapter 1010: Scheme Within a Scheme**

Guan Yu swept the long-faced youth with a dismissive glance.

The youth paled, darting a panicked look at Hu Zongze, whose face darkened. This bidder was Hu’s plant, tasked with inflating the price.

Hu had orchestrated this auction specifically for Guan Yu, knowing Wenqing’s fondness for the legend. By embedding a shill, he aimed to bleed Guan Yu dry. Even if Guan Yu defaulted, others would claim the jade.

Yet Hu miscalculated. The heirs’ fervor was feigned—none truly desired the stone. Even Guan Yu’s apparent rivals shared this ruse.

Hu now grasped his own entrapment. Though the bidder was his proxy, protocol demanded Hu cover the auction fee—20% of the hammer price. Thus, he’d lose 220 million while retaining his fake jade.

Seething at Guan Yu’s triumphant grin, Hu yearned to devour him whole.

Guan Yu smirked. He’d discerned Hu and the bidder’s collusion and exited strategically, leaving Hu ensnared.

Though enraged, Hu adhered to protocol. As he prepared to finalize the sale, Guan Yu suddenly called, “You there! Let’s negotiate.”

The long-faced youth pointed to himself. “Me?”

“Yes. How about relinquishing the jade? It’s counterfeit anyway.”

Hu Zongze erupted from the podium. “Guan Yu! How dare you slander my family’s integrity?!”

“You know its falsity. The craftsmanship is commendable—aging it a century. But your meddling ruined it. Pity.”

Hu’s eyes narrowed. “Explain yourself!”

“Simple. This isn’t the legendary He’s Bi Eternal Heart. It’s Dragon’s Saliva Jade—rare but incomparable to He’s Bi. The blood infusion? Freshly injected. A child could spot this forgery.”

Equipped with a detection system, Guan Yu had already verified the jade’s fraudulence.

“Lies!” Hu blustered, though well aware of its inauthenticity—the true Eternal Heart remained lost to time.

“Believe what you will. But you’ve spent 1.1 billion to reclaim your own fake, forfeiting 220 million in fees. Poor business, Hu Zongze.”

The crowd buzzed indignantly. Though none dared confront Hu openly, their mutters swelled.

Young Master Li demanded, “Hu, an explanation is due.”

Hu stiffened. “Do you doubt me too?”

Silence answered. Between Hu and Guan Yu, credibility leaned toward the latter.

Guan Yu pressed, “If it’s genuine, summon appraisers.”

Hu glowered. Experts would expose the fraud instantly.

As discontent mounted, Elder Wang—Hu’s advisor—ascended the podium. “Peace, everyone!”

The crowd hushed, recognizing his authority.

“This jade was a gift to Young Master Hu, who, lacking expertise, acted in good faith. The Hu family apologizes and will redress this matter. Let the auction proceed as protocol dictates.”

His placating words quelled the unrest—none wished to antagonize the Hus further.

Yet Guan Yu prodded, “Everyone knows the buyer is your proxy. Spare us the pretense.”

Elder Wang smiled mildly. “And how do you know he’s our agent?”

**Chapter 1011: Dongfang Mu**

“This gentleman, if I recall correctly, belongs to the Ouyang family of Jingdong. Isn’t that so, Young Master Ouyang?”
