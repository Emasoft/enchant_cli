The Emperor’s intentions were clear to all: he was shielding the Second Prince. The recent events had dealt a severe blow to the Second Prince, yet the Emperor remained unwilling to fully trust the Eldest Prince’s accusations, hence refraining from convicting Chancellor Li on the spot.

After all, the Eldest Prince had not handled a single affair of state in all these years. For him to suddenly sever one of the Second Prince’s key allies would seem unjustifiable. Thus, the Emperor employed a delaying tactic, intending to investigate thoroughly before making a decision. Of course, the Emperor also wished to prevent the Eldest Prince from becoming another Second Prince—suppressing the Second Prince’s influence while curbing the Eldest Prince’s attempts to form factions.

The Eldest Prince understood this well. Before attending the court session, Prime Minister Xiang had warned him of potential setbacks, as few trusted him due to his longstanding reputation for incompetence—a perception impossible to overturn overnight.

Though the Eldest Prince’s boldness in court had sparked new thoughts among officials, eliciting surprise and admiration, it was far too early for them to pledge allegiance to him.

The Emperor, too, had resolved not to let the Eldest Prince topple the Second Prince over this single incident. After settling his thoughts, the Emperor summoned the two maidservants to a side hall within the palace. Notably, the edict only called for “two witnesses,” excluding even the Eldest Prince, who had no choice but to depart.

The Emperor sat solemnly above as the two trembling maids knelt below. “Do not fear,” he said gently. “I mean you no harm. This matter does not concern you. I merely seek the unvarnished truth. Speak without concealment.”

To their surprise, the Emperor addressed them in a commoner’s tone, easing their tension. The bolder of the two recounted everything that had transpired in the City Lord’s residence. Her account aligned closely with the Eldest Prince’s, though it placed greater blame on the Imperial Guards, suggesting their presence had ignited the entire conflict.

**Chapter 4270: Loneliness**

The Emperor now confirmed that the Imperial Guards had indeed been dispatched by Chancellor Li under the Second Prince’s orders. Over a hundred guards had been mobilized to assist Minister Zhang in assassinating Prince Zou, thereby eliminating the Second Prince’s greatest threat. Yet the plan had backfired spectacularly: Prince Zou survived, while Minister Zhang perished—an outcome none had foreseen.

With such a large-scale operation, the Imperial Guards’ involvement could not be concealed. If proven true, their crime of executing a second-rank official—coupled with the Eldest Prince’s evidence—left no room for denial by Chancellor Li or the guards. However, as the Imperial Guards symbolized imperial authority, their direct punishment would tarnish the throne’s dignity. The Emperor needed an alternative resolution.

Suddenly, the Emperor’s expression darkened. Pointing at the maids, he roared, “Audacious liars! You dare deceive Us with falsehoods orchestrated by others! Guards—drag them out and beat them to death!”

A dozen sword-bearing guards stormed in. The maids paled, bewildered by the Emperor’s abrupt fury. They pleaded tearfully, “Your Majesty, we swear every word is true! No one coerced us!”

As the guards hauled them toward the door, the Emperor raised a hand. “Enough. Release them.”

This had been a ruse—a test of their honesty. Faced with mortal terror, the maids’ unwavering insistence on their story convinced the Emperor of its truth.

After dismissing the shaken maids, the Emperor pondered his next move. He considered consulting Yu Kong but refrained upon recalling Yu’s ties to Consort Guifen. Alone, he realized how isolated he was—surrounded by schemers, with none to trust.

Returning to his estate, the Eldest Prince received a letter from Consort Guifen advising caution: avoid the palace and lay low until alliances solidified. He agreed—his sudden rise from perceived incompetence required gradual acceptance to avoid backlash.

For now, he would await the Emperor’s decision. Without Prime Minister Xiang’s guidance, he felt adrift but resolved to avoid missteps. His priority was allying with Prince Zou, whose support would bolster his standing.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu instructed Qiqi in refining her inner energy control. Though she grasped basics, her self-taught methods were crude. Emphasizing internal cultivation over martial forms, he imparted口诀 (mantras) to deepen her foundation.

News of the Eldest Prince’s audacious accusation against Chancellor Li spread rapidly, stirring court and public alike. Many who had forgotten him now reassessed, though most still deemed his challenge to the Second Prince suicidal.

The Emperor’s withheld judgment fueled speculation. The court braced for turmoil, officials watching cautiously. When word reached Prince Zou, he resolved to meet the Eldest Prince.

**Chapter 4272: Staying**

Prince Zou proposed mobilizing Red Name Mountain’s bandits as a potential force. Their leader, Red, shrugged. “I drift through life. What of you, Lao Cang?”

“My path remains long,” Guan Yu replied. “We’ll meet again.”

To Red, he added, “I’ll remember Red Name Mountain. Expect a visit—keep the wine ready.”

Red laughed. “You’ll be welcomed!”

Sensing Red’s desire to abandon banditry, Guan Yu suggested, “Prince Zou will need loyal men in the capital. Would you and your men serve him?”

Red hesitated. “I can’t abandon my brothers.”

Guan Yu understood. “Let’s ask the prince.”

In Prince Zou’s carriage, Guan Yu broached the idea. The prince nodded. “I need trustworthy forces. Red could lead my guard.”

Red countered, “What of my six hundred men?”

Prince Zou proposed, “Once allied with the Eldest Prince, he may absorb them. For now, keep Red Name Mountain as a fallback.”

Red agreed, hopeful for legitimacy. Guan Yu vouched for his integrity, urging the prince’s advocacy.

Prince Zou then entreated Guan Yu: “Stay. I’d feel safer.”

Guan Yu demurred. “I’ll linger briefly to aid your transition.” Privately, he planned to send Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi to the Demon Soul Sect before venturing into the desert for the Eight-Sided Drum technique—preferring companions like Wang Jun and Xiao Zhi over Xiaorong’s insistence.

**Chapter 4274: Stability**

Guan Yu’s consciousness wavered as his inner seal—a whirling maelstrom—quivered, leaking memories and energy into his core. Though agonizing, he recognized this as the seal’s defensive panic, its grip faltering. Once impervious, it now seemed aged and erratic, permitting fragments of his past to resurface.

In normal states, the seal dominated arrogantly, sapping his cultivated energy. Now, destabilized, it offered glimpses of what it had stolen—if only he could endure.
