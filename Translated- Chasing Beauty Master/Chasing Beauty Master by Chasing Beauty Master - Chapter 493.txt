“Even among the elves most adept at magic, it takes at least a month for a novice to grasp the basics. Other races require even longer – some spend lifetimes stuck as mere apprentices! Yet Guan Yu mastered fire manipulation in mere hours. If this became known, wouldn’t it drive others mad with envy?”

Golden Ape rejoiced for Guan Yu, though his own knowledge of magic was limited to old tales. In the Azure Beauty Continent, martial artists vastly outnumbered mages – not because physical combat was superior, but because its entry threshold was lower. A strong physique could eventually make one a master, but magic demanded more: elemental absorption and arcane comprehension required rare innate talent!

As the two celebrated this magical breakthrough, Guan Yu suddenly heard voices. He swiftly concealed himself, ears pricked.

“Why are so many Fruits of Life scattered here?”

“Perhaps insects knocked them down?”

“Impossible! The protective array keeps pests out. Could thieves be here?”

“Nonsense! Every elf knows the Life Source is failing. What’s there to steal? If this continues six more months, there won’t be anything left to take! Then...”

“Then Elder Kyle and Young Master Locke will pressure Chief Allen to abdicate!”

“Hush! Keep your voice down! If overheard, we’re dead!”

“Who’s here but us? Listen – another secret. Breathe a word and we’re both doomed!”

“Speak!”

“Know why the Life Source faltered recently?”

“No!”

“Locke’s doing! He dosed it with growth accelerants, disrupting its cycles to undermine Chief Allen. His courtship of Amy? Merely political maneuvering!”

“Ah...”

The stunned silence mirrored Guan Yu’s own. He never imagined elves could harbor human-like villains – this Locke jeopardized his entire clan for ambition! Such a leader would spell disaster.

Guan Yu debated warning Chief Allen, fearing a premature coup. But the conversants suddenly exclaimed, “I sense magic residue here!”

Chapter 1248: Grand Ambition

Guan Yu realized his carelessness – elf elemental perception was legendary. Now came the dilemma: fight and risk exposure, or hide and likely be discovered. Choosing discretion, the Nascent Soul expert retreated, suppressing his aura to avoid elemental disturbances.

Soon, two elves approached.

“The trace vanished!”

“Your imagination. We’re alone here.”

“Unless... ghosts?”

“Damn you! Midnight ghost stories? Let’s harvest and leave!”

Their laughter faded after half an hour. Emerging, Guan Yu mused aloud: “I should warn the Chief immediately.”

A voice interjected – likely Golden Ape’s spiritual communication: “Patience. If I were Locke, I’d wait until massive withering. Why act now?”

“But wouldn’t leadership then bring responsibility?” Guan Yu wondered.

“Foolish!” Golden Ape retorted. “Why the crystal toad frenzy? It revives the dying! With it, even withered Life Trees could be restored.”

Enlightenment struck. “No wonder they covet it! But enough – I must solidify my magic. Tonight’s trials await.”

Guan Yu winced, recalling prior headaches from training. Sitting cross-legged, he channeled qi, summoning elements. Surprisingly, the process felt smoother now – elemental streams massaged rather than tortured him.

“Complacency!” Golden Ape warned. “At this rate, three years won’t match elf apprentices! Intensify absorption!”

Gritting teeth, Guan Yu roared: “For my future wives, endure!” Elements flooded in, each droplet like hot needles. Within half an hour, sweat drenched him.

“Enough,” Golden Ape advised. “Daily limits ensure Advanced Mage attainment in three days.”

“Advanced Mage?” Guan Yu scoffed. “A Nascent Soul settling for that? More!”

Querying magic ranks, he learned: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced Mage; then Master tiers up to Archmage and Forbidden Spellcasters. “Chief Allen must be Archmage level! Centuries ahead!”

“He’s 500 in elf years,” Golden Ape reminded. “You’d shame centuries of work?”

Guan Yu blinked. “Then Amy’s over a century old? No wonder she hates ‘little girl’!” Chuckling, he vowed: “Three days. I’ll shock them all. My goal – Archmage!”

Chapter 1249: First Test

Three days from zero to Archmage? From others, madness. From Guan Yu? Possible. But magic required talent beyond brute force. Golden Ape could only watch as elements swirled madly under the moon.

Dawn found Guan Yu stiff beneath trees, body screaming. “Magic before physical collapse?” He foraged Fruits of Life, stomach growling. Golden Ape suggested fishing via water magic.

At lakeside, Guan Yu focused. A water column erupted, delivering fish! “Control improves with practice,” Golden Ape noted. “Soon you’ll move mountains.”

Feasting on fire-roasted catch, Guan Yu napped briefly before resuming training. The final night approached. “Why three days?” Golden Ape pondered. “Hidden reason?”

Suddenly, Guan Yu collapsed, skin scorching. “To the lake!” Immersed, water boiled around him. Emerging exhausted, he growled: “The Life Source’s energy rebels in me!”

Chapter 1250: Challenge

“Perhaps expulsion...” Golden Ape ventured.

“Never!” Guan Yu roared. “What’s mine stays! I’ll master this!”

As his body steamed, realization struck: Chief Allen’s three-day limit was no accident. The Life Source’s essence was consuming its vessel. Time was running out – both for Guan Yu’s training and the elves’ conspiracy.
