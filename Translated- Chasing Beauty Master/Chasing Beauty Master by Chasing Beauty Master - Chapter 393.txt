“Eldest Sister-in-law, what do you mean by that? How could we drive them away? They left because the pay was too low. What does that have to do with us?”

The heavily made-up woman screeched upon hearing Liu Yunshu's words.

Guan Yu rolled his eyes inwardly. Not only was this woman ugly, but her brain also seemed defective—she couldn't even lie properly! The medical staff assigned to Old Master Liu were appointed by higher authorities. Even if they disliked their salaries, that concerned the higher-ups. How could they just quit on a whim? Clearly, these people had driven them away, likely because they resented the old man's longevity.

Such individuals disgusted Guan Yu to the core. Yet as Wen Qing's "boyfriend" today, he refrained from speaking up.

“Yuanyuan, do you take me for a fool?” Liu Yunshu retorted. “Father’s medical team was arranged by Uncle Li—specialists serving retired senior cadres. You expect me to believe they quit over low pay?”

“Are you accusing us of expelling them then?”

“Enough!” Liu Yunjie, who had remained silent until now, suddenly barked. “Must you keep squabbling? Yuanyuan—I’ve been away these days. Tell me truthfully: did you drive Dr. Zhang’s team away?”

**Chapter 984: The Liu Family Feud**

As the current Municipal Political and Legal Affairs Committee Secretary and pillar of the Liu family, Liu Yunjie’s words carried weight. Even his younger brothers dared not contradict him. Under his interrogation, the garishly dressed woman stammered, “I...I sent them away because they were incompetent.”

Guan Yu sneered. His investigative system had already exposed Li Yuanyuan’s true motive—she coveted the medical staff’s monthly 50,000 yuan salary. Since these private caregivers were paid through the Liu family account, she and the second daughter-in-law Han Yazhi had conspired to dismiss them.

“Outrageous!” Liu Yunjie’s anger flared. Since the family’s decline, he’d rarely returned home, yet never imagined his siblings would neglect their father’s welfare. “Yunshu, I want to take Father to my residence.”

“Impossible!” His younger brothers protested immediately. If others learned they’d forced their father out, their social standing would crumble.

“Why not? Since you neglect Father, why shouldn’t I—”

“No means no!”

As arguments erupted, Old Master Liu sighed deeply. Even a seasoned governor like him couldn’t resolve family disputes—a failing that explained their current predicament.

“Grandfather, let’s drink.” Disturbed by the noise, Guan Yu poured the old man wine. Third son Liu Yunwei snapped, “Who said you could sit here, driver?”

Amused by the mistaken identity, Guan Yu ignored him. Noticing the old man’s hesitation, he reassured, “Drink freely. I’ll ensure your health.”

“Grandpa, Guan Yu’s medical skills are amazing!” Wen Qing chimed in. “He could make you ten years younger!”

“Excellent!” The old man beamed at his favorite granddaughter. But as he reached for the cup, Liu Yunwei grabbed his arm. “No alcohol!” He smashed the glass, spilling wine everywhere.

Old Master Liu’s face darkened with rage.

Guan Yu’s voice turned icy. “Whoever you are—lick that wine off the table. Now.”

“Who is this?” Liu Yunjie demanded as quarrels ceased.

“Uncle, he’s my boyfriend Guan Yu!” Wen Qing began.

“Another penniless wretch,” Li Yuanyuan sneered. “My Wenwen’s fiancé comes from a military family—he’ll make her a minister’s wife!”

Liu Yunshu flushed crimson. “Must you dredge up the past? If not for my husband’s intervention, you’d all be in jail for embezzling millions!”

***

The room fell silent. Years earlier, the Liu brothers’ greed had nearly destroyed the family. Their 100-million-yuan corruption scandal required the old master and Wen Qing’s father Wen Baoguo to intervene—sacrificing political careers for reduced sentences.

“Silence!” The patriarch finally roared. “This is a family dinner to meet Qing’s partner. Leave if you can’t behave!”

As tensions subsided, car wheels crunched outside. Liu Wenwen entered with her boyfriend Li Bing—a general’s grandson. The family fawned over him, though Guan Yu noted the man’s leer at Wen Qing.

“So this is your ‘boyfriend’?” Liu Wenwen smirked at Guan Yu. “I thought he was the chauffeur.”

Wen Qing reddened, but Guan Yu calmly said, “Darling, never bite back when a dog barks.”

“Who’re you calling a dog?!” Liu Wenwen shrieked.

“The self-identified one.”

Li Bing interjected coldly, “What does your family do?”

“Irrelevant,” Guan Yu retorted.

As insults flew, Guan Yu’s patience snapped. “Apologize to Wen Qing immediately—or regret it.”

“Apologize?!” Liu Yunwei shouted. “This is the Liu residence! Know your place!”

“Enough!” The patriarch thundered. “I decide who stays.”

Guan Yu turned respectfully. “Grandfather, may I discipline these ‘uncles’?”

**Chapter 985: Provoking Wrath**

Liu Yunwei scoffed. “Who do you think you are? The Chairman?”

Guan Yu coolly recited: “Liu Yunwei—CEO of Liwei Realty. Liu Yunli—Chairman. Both convicted of corruption. Your shell company exists for money laundering. Sell it to me—you’ll work as my janitors.”

The brothers laughed derisively. “Buy our company? Dream on!”

Guan Yu smiled. “We’ll see.”
