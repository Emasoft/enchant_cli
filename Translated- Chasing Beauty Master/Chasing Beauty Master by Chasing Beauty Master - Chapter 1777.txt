From afar, Guan Yu spotted a group of people on the mountain ahead. Flying closer, he discovered members of the Red Lotus Sect and True Sun Sect engaged in some unknown activity.

Descending with his companions, Guan Yu was surprised to find Ling Su present. “To think he survived and made it here—this fellow truly has nine lives,” he muttered.

“This is a matter between us and the True Sun Sect. Do the Yunqing Sect intend to meddle?” Elder Zhao of the Red Lotus Sect sneered upon noticing Guan Yu.

“Elder, you misunderstand. We merely happened to pass by and have no interest in your affairs,” Guan Yu replied with a polite smile.

He wondered what could possibly spark conflict between the two factions. The Eight-Sided Drum Technique already lay hidden in his robes. Were they squabbling over old grudges? Prioritizing an exit seemed far wiser than wasting time here.

Though the Red Lotus Sect outnumbered the others, Elder Zhao’s spiritual energy had been severely depleted during earlier clashes with the Right Envoy’s forces, leaving him hesitant to act recklessly.

Approaching the True Sun Sect’s approachable elder, Guan Yu asked, “What brings you here? Could you have found the Eight-Sided Drum Technique?”

“No. While searching, we discovered *that*,” the elder gestured to a crimson-hued boulder nearby—a legendary Bloodstone. “But the Red Lotus Sect arrived shortly after and now contests our claim.”

Bloodstones were rare treasures for cultivators, prized for refining high-grade magic artifacts. The gems adorning Siqi’s jade ruyi were of this type, but the boulder before them—larger than a human head—exuded unparalleled purity. With the drum technique missing, securing such a prize would justify their expedition.

Guan Yu chuckled. “A fine treasure indeed. But the sun sinks westward. If night falls before we locate an exit, we’ll be trapped here for a year. Do you plan to stalemate that long?”

He marveled at Miao City’s abundance. Beyond this Bloodstone, the colossal black jade embedded in the waterfall’s heart was another priceless relic—though its size and precarious position made retrieval impossible.

“What jest is this?” Elder Zhao spat. “Does the True Sun Sect’s poverty blind you? We clearly discovered this Bloodstone first. Since when do your elders spout baseless claims?”

While the rivalry made sense, Guan Yu pressed, “If we don’t prioritize the exit, none will leave. Why linger?”

The True Sun elder calmly countered, “Exits become accessible after nightfall. Why rush? Unless... you’ve already secured the drum technique?”

Every eye snapped toward Guan Yu, burning with sudden hunger. He inwardly cursed—this seemingly benign elder had deftly redirected attention toward him.

“Had I found it, I’d be safeguarding it elsewhere,” Guan Yu deflected with a strained smile. “But your words intrigue me. You mean to wait passively for night?”

“Ignorance is expected of youth,” the elder patronized. “Searching is futile. Darkness itself delivers our departure.”

This contradicted rumors of explorers vanishing forever. Guan Yu challenged, “Then why do histories speak of those never returning?”

“Likely devoured by beasts before night rescued them,” came the dismissive reply.

Guan Yu shelved further questions—the elder wouldn’t reveal sources. With both sects unconcerned about exits, he relaxed. A year among companions, especially Siqi, seemed bearable.

“I’ll remain neutral in your dispute,” Guan Yu declared. “The Bloodstone’s ownership is yours to settle.”

“Hypocrite!” Ling Su shouted from afar. “You await their mutual destruction to claim the prize!”

Guan Yu’s gaze turned glacial. “Were I so inclined, who here could stop me? But unlike some *stir-sticks*, I honor my sect’s dignity.”

“Then leave!” snapped Lai Lixia, emerging from the Red Lotus ranks. “We trust Yunqing’s reputation, not *you*.”

“My conduct requires no validation,” Guan Yu retorted. “I’ll stay and observe. What will you do—attack?”

Lai Lixia blustered, “Our combined force could end you!”

Laughter rippled through the crowd. All knew Guan Yu’s dual mastery of magic and martial arts made him unmatched in single combat—likely superior even to sect elders.

“You?” Guan Yu sneered. “Elder Zhao expended his magic protecting deadweight disciples. His shattered artifacts and drained reserves leave your sect toothless. Test me, and I’ll kneel and call you ‘grandfather’ if defeated.”

Elder Zhao paled as his weaknesses were laid bare. The True Sun faction brightened—their advantage now obvious.

“Though weakened, my disciples remain formidable,” Elder Zhao warned. “Claiming the Bloodstone would cost you dearly.”

“Divide it equally!” Wang Jun suggested.

Elders scoffed. Bloodstone’s legendary hardness made splitting impossible. As tensions mounted, Guan Yu interjected, “Conflict benefits only the Demon Soul Sect. Seek peaceful resolution.”

“Easier said than done,” the True Sun elder muttered.

“More interference!” Ling Su jeered. “You covet the stone yourself!”

“Must every conversation attract squawking crows?” Guan Yu snapped. “By what right do you speak here?”

“I need no rights!” Ling Su retorted. “This isn’t your domain!”

Wang Jun sighed. “Brother Ling, hunting the drum technique would better serve than provoking Guan Yu.”

Ling Su fell silent, though ambition flickered—securing the Bloodstone might redeem his failed mission.

Noticing the sun’s descent, Guan Yu mused, “If darkness brings escape, why hasn’t this been common knowledge?” The elder’s theory failed to explain historical disappearances.

Meanwhile, Elder Zhao probed Ling Su: “The Yunqing Sect’s famed unity falters today.”

Guan Yu’s jaw tightened as Ling Su preened under recognition. “Yunqing’s reputation suffers enough without your posturing,” he nearly spat.

As sunlight dwindled, Guan Yu resolved to wait. With allies and Siqi present, even a year’s confinement seemed tolerable. The True Sun Sect’s calm suggested hidden knowledge, but unraveling mysteries could wait. Survival—and watching Ling Su’s inevitable downfall—took precedence.

**Chapter 4649: Disbelief**

If darkness enabled exit, why had previous explorers vanished? Guan Yu’s doubts mounted. The elder’s explanation—beast attacks preempting rescue by night—felt incomplete.

**Chapter 4650: Endless Nonsense**

Wang Jun’s compromise proposal met derision. Bloodstone’s indivisible nature rendered the suggestion laughable. As factions postured, Guan Yu noted Ling Su’s calculating gaze—the agitator still hoped to salvage glory from chaos.
