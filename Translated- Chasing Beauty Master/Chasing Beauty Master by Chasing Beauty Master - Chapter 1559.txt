“Brother, don’t be hasty. The man we’re after is a prince—it won’t be easy,” the other said. “But we’re fully prepared now. There’s no fear of tricks. Reveal yourselves!”

The final two words were roared out. Guan Yu then noticed movement in the other three directions. Slowly, figures emerged—archers from each flank. Once within range, they knelt and aimed their bows at Prince Zou’s carriage.

Guan Yu frowned. This was trouble. He’d assumed only the road ahead was blocked. If the prince tried to flee, it might not have been difficult. But now, with archers encircling them, escape seemed impossible. Surrounded on all sides, the situation was dire.

Even if they broke through one flank, the other three groups would swiftly converge. Prince Zou’s life hung by a thread.

“Hahaha,” the leader chuckled. “As I said, if you value your lives, leave now. I only want the prince in the carriage. The rest may go unharmed.”

Zou Wuhui clenched his fists. With so many archers, they’d be turned into pincushions before they could retaliate or flee.

Zou Wuxiao glanced at Guan Yu, hoping for a plan. Guan Yu rode forward, halting midway between the two groups. Pointing at the leader, he said, “Sirs, how has our prince wronged you? State your demands plainly.”

Stalling was their only option. All hopes rested on Guan Yu. Inside the carriage, Prince Zou seethed—his royal status now felt like a shackle.

“No negotiations,” the leader snapped. “I want Prince Zou’s head. Take your gold and go. You’ve no escape. This is mercy.”

“How noble,” Guan Yu mocked. “With your numbers, you could’ve slaughtered us already. Why the theatrics?”

“I prefer minimal bloodshed. Only the prince dies. The rest needn’t perish for his sake.”

Guan Yu smiled. “If it’s wealth you seek, the prince can grant lands, gold, women—name your price.”

“His head guarantees lifelong riches. We don’t need your bribes,” the leader sneered.

“A jest!” Guan Yu laughed. “Assassinate a prince? The emperor will hunt you down. Even if you succeed, your master will silence you. Dead men tell no tales.”

The leader wavered, then growled, “Enough! Hand over the prince in five counts, or we slaughter you all.”

**Chapter 4043: Striking from the Shadows**

Five counts. No mercy. Guan Yu wouldn’t wait.

He gripped his crossbow—a less recognizable weapon than his pistol. Its anonymity was crucial. He’d use it sparingly, but desperation demanded action.

Aiming at a distant tree, he fired. The bolt thudded into bark, shaking leaves loose. An illusion: allies hidden in the woods.

“We anticipated your ambush,” Guan Yu declared. “Surrender, or be wiped out.”

Seizing the moment, Prince Zou fired his own crossbow at the archers. A man gasped, flung backward against a tree—dead. Chaos erupted as a spooked horse trampled two others before a blade silenced it.

Guan Yu pressed the advantage. “Flee now, or join your comrade.”

The leader paled, scanning the shadows. His men murmured,动摇.

“Still confident?” Guan Yu taunted. “A prince doesn’t travel lightly. Try reaching him—see if your head stays attached.”

Tension crackled. Behind him, Wang Jun severed a bowstring with a hidden shot. The archer bolted, screaming of ghosts. Panic spread.

“Steady!” the leader barked, though his voice trembled. He inspected his fallen man—a chest wound, no visible weapon. “Beware hidden blades!”

Guan Yu yawned theatrically. “No blades here. But our allies? Who knows? Leave while you can.”

“I didn’t come to retreat!” the leader spat.

“Then try.” Guan Yu leveled his crossbow. “Step forward. Let’s see who dies first.”

The standoff held. Guan Yu’s bluff teetered—if they scouted the woods, all would collapse. Yet fear held them.

Wang Jun struck again, snapping a bow. The archer fled, sparking disarray. The leader grimaced. Retreat meant disgrace. Advance risked annihilation.

“Attack!” he finally roared. “Take the prince’s head!”

Guan Yu sighed. Protecting the prince without revealing his cultivation would be arduous. But as the archers nocked arrows, he fired—a bolt piercing the leader’s lieutenant. Horses reared; chaos erupted.

Amid the bedlam, Guan Yu whispered to Wang Jun, “Ready the carriage. We break northeast—now!”
