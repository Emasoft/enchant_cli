Although there were many peach blossoms here, they were not as beautiful as they appeared from a distance. Moreover, not all the trees were peach blossoms; there were also other miscellaneous weeds and trees.

However, it was rather strange to find so many wild peach trees here. Moreover, these peach blossoms differed from any Guan Yu had seen before—they were unusually large and emitted an intense fragrance.

Guan Yu had certainly seen peach blossoms back in Huaxia, but none carried such a heavy scent as those here.

Unconsciously, the group had reached halfway up the mountain, where a flat platform lay. Guan Yu suggested, “Let’s rest here for a while.”

Yue Gao tied the carriage to a nearby peach tree and joined them. Having rushed over in haste, they had brought no food and could only drink water for now. There was little else to be done.

The path upward grew increasingly rugged and steep. While traversable on foot, the carriage would likely have to remain here.

After taking a sip of water, Yue Gao stood and said, “Look—the view from here is still beautiful, isn’t it? I’ve heard the mountain’s northern side has a river, and I believe the opposite slope borders a lake. Though I’ve never ventured there myself, so I can’t say for certain.”

“It’s truly breathtaking here,” Wang Xiaorong remarked joyfully, her smile never leaving her face. She secretly wished the Demon Soul Sect could have been established on this very Peach Blossom Mountain.

“Since we’ve come all this way, why not explore further?” Guan Yu proposed. “The densest peach blossoms should be near the summit.”

Yue Gao surveyed the area and agreed, “Very well. We might as well make the most of our visit. Let’s take this path—it’s wide enough for the carriage.”

Though Yue Gao’s chosen route wasn’t the most direct ascent, Guan Yu saw no need to insist on reaching the peak. After all, they had come for leisure.

The trio continued upward, with Wang Xiaorong remaining the most spirited. She seemed impervious to fatigue, buoyed by some unseen delight, while Yue Gao trailed behind, leading the carriage.

Finally, they reached the summit—a lofty perch where strong winds tore petals from blossoms, sending them spiraling through the air before settling on the ground in a mesmerizing display.

The air itself seemed infused with peach fragrance, carried by winds that scattered petals like snow. Suddenly, Guan Yu recalled an old saying: *“Where fragrant winds roam afar, divine arts shall reveal themselves.”*

These were the two lines Patriarch Meng Hua had left as clues to the Eight-Sided Drum Technique. Guan Yu wondered if the “fragrant winds” hinted at similar scents in Miao City, where following their trail might lead to the technique’s whereabouts. Still, confirmation would have to wait until they reached the city itself.

“Look,” Guan Yu pointed downward. “That river nearly encircles the Peach Blossom Mountain before winding into the distance.”

“Indeed,” Yue Gao replied. “It’s called Peach Blossom River. During this season, when countless flowers bloom, the ground becomes carpeted in petals. When winds blow, they carry blossoms into the water until the river itself flows pink with petals—a magnificent sight.”

“Right now, the blossoms have just begun to bloom, so fewer petals have fallen. Return in a few days, and you’ll see not just the trees but the entire mountainside blanketed in pink. The whole mountain transforms into a sea of peach blossoms.”

“It’s already far more beautiful than anything near my home,” Wang Xiaorong sighed.

Yue Gao asked curiously, “Oh? Where is your home, Miss Meimei?”

Caught off guard by the question, Wang Xiaorong hesitated before answering, “Qujiang City. Both Guan Yu and I are from there.”

**Chapter 3674: Wild Peach Blossoms (Part 2)**

Fortunately, Yue Gao didn’t press further. Checking the time, Guan Yu said, “We should head back. The return journey is long, and if we don’t start now, we’ll reach the inn by midnight.”

“So soon?” Wang Xiaorong pouted. “We’ve barely arrived!”

“Would you prefer to starve here overnight?” Guan Yu countered. “We brought no provisions.”

Reluctantly accepting this logic—and remembering their planned desert expedition tomorrow—the trio began their descent.

While the horse had struggled uphill with the carriage, the downhill journey proved worse. Without proper brakes, the vehicle’s momentum overwhelmed the animal. The carriage bounced violently behind the galloping horse, Yue Gao barely keeping pace as he jogged alongside.

Wang Xiaorong giggled. “Look at Yue Gao! He looks like a proper groom taming a wild steed.”

Growing concerned, Guan Yu suggested, “Let’s help stabilize the carriage from behind. If we slow its momentum, the horse won’t bolt as fast—and we might prevent damage.”

The rocky path threatened to shatter their only transport. A broken carriage would force them to walk back to town—a five- to six-hour trek.

“Brother Yue, slow down! I’ll assist!” Guan Yu called out, rushing forward.

Just then, a wheel struck a stone at speed. The carriage veered sideways, and as Yue Gao desperately pulled the reins, the panicked horse kicked backward—its hoof smashing into the already tilting vehicle.

With a sickening crack, the left support beam snapped. The carriage flipped, rolled downhill, and crashed against a peach tree, coming to rest in splinters.

After calming the horse, Yue Gao stared dejectedly at the wreckage. Guan Yu arrived breathless. “How did this happen so fast? I was just coming to help!”

“The carriage is ruined,” Wang Xiaorong groaned. “What do we do now?”

“We can’t walk back. Let’s see if it’s fixable,” Yue Gao said, more concerned about transportation than the loss. Inspecting the wreck, he shook his head. “The axle’s broken. I could fashion a temporary beam, but the wheel is shattered. Without a wheel, we’re stranded.”

“No spare tire?” Guan Yu blurted.

“Spare... tire?” Yue Gao looked puzzled. Realizing his anachronism, Guan Yu waved off the question—wooden wheels with iron rims required specialized tools unavailable here.

Slumping to the ground, Yue Gao muttered, “What now?” He glanced westward and stiffened. “The sky’s changing. Rain approaches.”

Following his gaze, Guan Yu saw ominous black clouds gathering. “We need shelter immediately. Finding cover takes priority over everything else. Lead the horse—let’s move!”

Yue Gao brightened. “I recall a temple behind the mountain! Let’s head there for shelter and regroup.”

A thunderclap shook the heavens, sending Wang Xiaorong diving into Guan Yu’s arms. “Then hurry!” Guan Yu urged. “The storm’s nearly upon us!”

Raindrops began falling as they hurried around the mountainside. Yue Gao pointed upward. “There—the temple on the cliffside!”

Guan Yu frowned at the precarious structure perched near a roaring waterfall. “Who builds a temple on a cliff edge?” he wondered, deeming its architect foolish. As they approached, the waterfall’s thunder drowned out the rain.

**Chapter 3676: Introducing the Disciples**

The disciple appeared muscular despite his loose monastic robes, his thick neck hinting at a lifetime of martial training.

“This is my eldest disciple, Ah Wu,” the old monk introduced. “He’s practiced with me here for nearly forty years and manages the temple’s daily affairs.”

Next, he gestured to a short, rotund man with a fleshy face and thick lips. “My second disciple, Ah Huo, oversees our livestock, crops, and kitchen.”

Finally, he indicated a youth staring at his feet. “Our youngest, Ah Xiao, twenty-two, handles procurement and cleaning.” Though timid, the boy’s large ears stood out prominently.

“You’re drenched,” the monk continued. “My disciples will fetch dry clothes and water. Freshen up, then join us for supper. They’ll attend to any needs.”

The unexpected hospitality—likely spurred by Guan Yu’s earlier bribe of gold leaf—pleased Yue Gao. After washing up, they found the rain had ceased, leaving a pristine sunset.

“We can’t return tonight,” Wang Xiaorong observed. “Descending now would leave us stranded in darkness.”

“Perhaps the temple has horses?” Yue Gao suggested.

Approached by Ah Xiao for a temple tour, Guan Yu inquired about mounts. “None,” the young disciple replied. “Descending now is unsafe.”

“What dangers lurk?” Yue Gao joked. “Wolves?”

“Worse.” Ah Xiao paled. “The Heaven-Hound stalks here—it devours people.”

Guan Yu’s interest sharpened. “Heaven-Hound? Like the folklore beast that eats the moon?”

“Three years ago—” Ah Xiao clapped a hand over his mouth. “I’ve said too much! Let’s continue the tour.”

Though frustrated by the unfinished tale, the group followed Ah Xiao through the temple—a three-tiered structure clinging to the cliffside. Exterior walkways connected levels, rooms accessible only from outside.

Near the waterfall, a low door caught Guan Yu’s eye. “Why is this entrance so small?”

Ah Xiao stiffened. “Just a storage room. Nothing worth—”

“Guests may enter,” interrupted Ah Wu, appearing suddenly. He ducked inside, the others following.

The cramped space surprised them—its ceiling soared unexpectedly high. “Remarkable,” Guan Yu murmured, gazing upward as the disciples’ secrets loomed as large as the hidden chamber around them.
