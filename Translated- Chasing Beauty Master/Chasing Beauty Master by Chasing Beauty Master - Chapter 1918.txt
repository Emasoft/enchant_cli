As soon as Guan Yu finished speaking, Qiqi immediately protested. She first pulled out a silver ingot from her person and slammed it heavily into the old woman's collection plate. "Brother Wan," she said, "I never realized you could be so stingy! If you don't have small coins, just give the whole ingot! Being so miserly is truly shameful."

"Oh! Thank you, young mistress! Thank you!" The old woman's eyes widened at the ten-tael silver ingot – such generosity from patrons was exceedingly rare. Overwhelmed with emotion, she clutched the precious metal to her chest.

Chapter 5040: Danger

Qiqi waved her hand dismissively. "You earn this through honest sweat. No need for thanks. At least your strength-driven performance pleases me – this is simple commerce."

Guan Yu wore an expression of helplessness, his cheeks flushing under Qiqi's rebuke. His money pouch contained only gold leaf notes and silver certificates, not a single loose coin. Though the performers' act was impressive and his wealth limitless, he couldn't possibly shower silver on every stranger they encountered. Qiqi's donation seemed appropriate – having been a street performer herself, she understood the value of even small coins better than most.

"Grandmother," Qiqi added cheerfully, "if you must thank someone, thank this fine young master here. Hahaha! All my silver comes from him anyway."

"Thank you, young master! Our deepest gratitude!" The old woman bowed repeatedly. Guan Yu merely smiled wordlessly. Let Qiqi have her moment – he could afford this minor indulgence.

This single ingot likely surpassed their usual daily earnings. The old woman's wrinkled face blossomed into a radiant smile as she carefully stored away their unexpected windfall.

As the performance resumed, the matriarch returned to center stage after collecting donations. "Our heartfelt thanks for your generosity!" she announced. "Your presence honors us! Now behold our most daring feat!"

The two muscular men supporting towering benches – each bearing a child's weight – now dripped with sweat. At the matriarch's signal, they cautiously narrowed the gap between their benches to two meters. The boy and girl perched atop faced each other across the void.

Suddenly both children leaped! The boy sprang higher while the girl jumped lower, drawing gasps from the crowd as they swapped positions mid-air seven meters above ground – all while balancing on narrow benches supported by a single hand each. The death-defying maneuver hung suspended for a heartbeat before...

Thunderous applause erupted as both landed safely, though the older man's bench wobbled dangerously before stabilizing. The more perilous the stunt, the greater the crowd's exhilaration – this universal truth held firm.

Guan Yu observed critically. These were ordinary folk, not martial artists. A single misstep could send them plunging to disaster. "They truly risk life and limb," he murmured.

Qiqi paled beside him. "This is too dangerous! Grandpa never allowed me such risky acts." Her own performances had involved safe ground-level feats like juggling vases on upturned feet. The current display made her own childhood struggles seem tame by comparison.

As the children prepared to repeat their aerial exchange, excited spectators began tossing coins and silver pieces into the arena. The matriarch scurried to collect these offerings, crawling on hands and knees to retrieve every precious copper.

Disaster struck during the second attempt. When the girl landed, her supporting bench trembled from the old man's exhausted arms. A slight wobble became catastrophic as her foot slipped...

Screams tore through the crowd as she plummeted. The old man desperately flung his bench aside to catch her, but the collapsing structure threatened to crush the other performers. Though he caught the girl, the impact drove him to his knees. Meanwhile, the boy now fell uncontrolled toward stone pavement.

Chapter 5041: Intervention

At the fatal moment when broken bones seemed inevitable, a blur intercepted the falling boy. Guan Yu's foot cushioned the descent before his hand seized the child's belt, suspending him inches above certain injury.

Silence gripped the square. The troupe stared in stunned gratitude while spectators clutched their chests. Such catastrophic failures were known occupational hazards, but witnessing near-death chilled every heart.

"You risk too much for coin," Guan Yu admonished, setting down the trembling boy. "Without safety measures, this recklessness must cease."

"Thank you for saving me, uncle," the boy stammered, bowing deeply.

As the troupe gathered to express thanks, Guan Yu waved them off. "The elder's strength fails him. This act courts disaster – abandon it."

The old man sighed heavily. "Age claims what youth once promised. Today... today proved me inadequate."

"Grandpa, don't be sad!" The girl hugged his waist. "We're all safe!" Her filial piety shone through the trauma.

With the performance's abrupt end, the crowd's mood soured. Some demanded refunds; others left cursing. Yet compassionate souls added more coins, acknowledging the troupe's plight.

As Guan Yu turned to leave, the matriarch hurried after him. "Young master, please!" She pressed returned silver into his hand. "We cannot keep your generosity after failing the show."

"Keep it," Guan Yu refused gently. "Feed your children. No one should perform hungry."

The children suddenly knelt, kowtowing before him. "We thank our savior!" they chorused.

"Rise, please!" Guan Yu lifted them hastily. "No need for such formality."

Qiqi approached thoughtfully. "Brother Wan, let's help them properly." When Guan Yu produced a fifty-tael note, she shook her head. "Silver solves today's hunger. What of tomorrow?"

Chapter 5042: Patronage

Qiqi's eyes sparkled with inspiration. "Your Crimson Charm Theater! They could join the troupe – their skills would dazzle audiences!"

Guan Yu paused. The idea held merit – adding acrobatics to the theater's opera performances could create something extraordinary. Yet the decision wasn't his alone. "Seek Master Chu Fan in the capital," he instructed, penning a referral letter. "He'll shelter you until my return."

The troupe stared bewildered until Qiqi explained: "This man is your benefactor! His theater offers steady work – no more street dangers!"

"But we need to tour for coin..." the boy protested uncertainly.

"At the theater, you'll earn proper wages!" Qiqi countered. "No more begging for scraps after risking your necks!"

As realization dawned, the matriarch wept joyful tears. The children embraced, envisioning regular meals and safe training. Guan Yu watched Qiqi's radiant smile, recognizing this solution healed her own past hardships as much as it aided the performers.

In that moment, dusty streets transformed into hope's stage – where broken dreams could rise phoenix-like through compassion's flames.
