Guan Yu sheathed the blade. Though initially tempted to bid two million outright out of curiosity, he decided to wait until later observers had examined it. There would be ample time to bid when the desert price level was reached.

Two attendants began circulating the blade among each row of guests. Interested parties lifted it for inspection while others didn't even glance at it.

Fan Tong's words rang true - the items here carried fixed prices, take it or leave it. Though appearing as mere scrap metal, this blade commanded its valuation.

After a pause, Fan Tong resumed from the stage: "Ladies and gentlemen, disregard this blade's appearance - its true worth lies not in superficial value. Regular patrons know our prices, while not guaranteeing quality, always reflect fair valuation. This obsidian blade is worth every coin."

Turning to Wang Jun, Guan Yu inquired, "What material do you suppose this is? Could it serve our purposes?"

"Likely useless," Wang Jun reasoned. "Though unidentified, its immense weight suggests extraordinary density. Such material would require extreme melting points - beyond ordinary flames. Even if smelted, the resulting crossbow would be unwieldy. Portability remains crucial for handheld weaponry."

Guan Yu nodded thoughtfully as Wang Xiaorong interjected: "Guan Yu! You're not considering millions for this scrap iron? Have you lost your senses?"

"It's not scrap," Guan Yu retorted irritably. "Though unidentified, I sense rarity here. Such artifacts don't surface often."

"Demonic Soul Sect has warehouses full of metalwork. Why overspend here? I oppose this purchase," Wang Xiaorong urged.

"Your sect's treasures remain yours," Guan Yu countered. "What I acquire must serve Cloud Azure Sect. Those elders possess sharp eyes - they'd discern any borrowed implements."

A fleeting fantasy crossed Guan Yu's mind - establishing his own faction, commanding loyal followers. Yet reality reasserted itself. Unlike earthly realms where wealth commanded power, this world demanded martial prowess. Established sects boasted millennia of history. Without comparable strength, any new faction would be swiftly devoured.

Fan Tong's voice carried anew: "This blade's composition requires expert analysis. Yet even stone or sand becomes valuable when containing mysteries. Consider it not as blade but enigmatic metal - its value lies in undiscovered properties."

"I'll inspect it!" boomed a voice from the rear. Before attendants could approach, a muscular man strode forward, hefting the blade single-handedly.

Guan Yu observed the display of strength - forty-pound weight lifted effortlessly. "No ordinary man," Wang Jun noted. Guan Yu nodded agreement.

The bearer appeared incongruous - youthful features contrasting his gruff voice. The twenty-something's delicate hands examined the blade meticulously, tongue clicking in appraisal.

"Has he identified the metal?" Wang Xiaorong whispered.

After prolonged inspection, Fan Tong prompted: "Young master, any insights? If not, please return the blade for others' examination."

Guan Yu noted the preferential treatment - his own extended inspection had drawn no such intervention.

"Solid mercury," the man declared, returning the blade. "Rarer than gold, denser than common quicksilver."

"Solid mercury?" Fan Tong echoed dubiously.

The man resumed his seat, holding placard thirty-three. "Mercury's liquid form is known - toxic heavy metal. But solid mercury..."

Wang Jun murmured: "Common knowledge - mercury's neurotoxicity causes brain atrophy."

Alarmed, Wang Xiaorong seized Guan Yu's hands. "You handled it! Wash immediately!"

Guan Yu chuckled. "Poisoning requires inhalation or wound exposure. Mere contact is harmless."

Placard thirty-three continued: "Public misconception - mercury only harms through deliberate exposure. This blade..."

Fan Tong interrupted: "Relevance to our auction, young master?"

"Solid mercury constitutes this blade!" the man asserted. "Forging such material demonstrates extraordinary skill. As ancestral blacksmiths, we recognize its value - peerless weapon material when properly worked."

He elaborated: "First, its hardness surpasses stone. Second, enhanced toxicity - any wound from this blade induces near-incurable poisoning. Handle with wrapped hilt and scabbard for safe carriage."

The crowd recoiled. Fan Tong signaled attendants to withdraw the blade, fearing ruined sale.

"Misunderstanding!" the man protested. "Properly sheathed, it's safe! Solid mercury surpasses gold's value. Forged into weapons, it becomes naturally venomous armament."

Fan Tong seized the reprieve: "Regardless of composition, bidding commences at stated value!"

"Two million!" declared placard thirty-three. "None shall contest? This metal shall become peerless armaments!"

Guan Yu studied the apparent blacksmith - refined features belying brute strength, clearly a martial practitioner rather than cultivator.

As Fan Tong prepared to finalize, Wang Jun whispered: "Could this metal fashion crossbow bolts instead?"

"Three million!" Guan Yu shouted, halting the auctioneer's hammer.

Fan Tong beamed. "Our new VIP guest counters! Any higher bids?"

Silence prevailed. The gavel fell - Guan Yu secured the forty-pound blade.

Subsequent auction items offered antiques and curiosities, none practical for Guan Yu's needs.

Post-auction, an elderly retainer approached Wang Xiaorong. "Young mistress, procure necessities?"

She turned to Guan Yu: "Further purchases required?"
