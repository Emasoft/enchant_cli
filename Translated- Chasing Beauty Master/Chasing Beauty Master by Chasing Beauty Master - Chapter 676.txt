The five mutants in this room alone could sweep through any small nation with ease. To put it plainly, these individuals accompanied by an army could effortlessly overthrow the government of a minor country.

Yet these five mutants weren't even the main figures in the main hall. At the center sat two men: one was an elderly man with snow-white cropped hair and a face twisted with brutish flesh, clad in traditional Eastern Island attire; the other was a middle-aged man in a Western suit, wearing polygonal glasses. Behind the latter stood a youth who kept his head bowed, features obscured by shadows.

Of course, to Guan Yu, even a masked face posed no obstacle—his divine sense could pierce through disguises. What surprised him was discovering the youth to be a woman. Though her angular features bore a masculine vigor, her throat and chest unmistakably revealed her true identity.

This woman’s aura was deeply restrained. Anyone but Guan Yu would have failed to perceive her strength. Yet he sensed she was a first-class mutant, surpassing even another first-class mutant present, as well as Yu Zhengchun and Meng Feilong.

Clearly, she was an unregistered first-class mutant kept secret by Eastern Island’s authorities. Perhaps she had undergone illicit mutation experiments like the guardians of Huanyu Corporation, or perhaps she represented one of Eastern Island’s hidden trump cards. Regardless, her presence shocked Guan Yu profoundly.

The white-haired elder smiled faintly, drained his teacup, and cleared his throat. “Mr. Takagi, visiting our humble association so late at night—this must concern your daughter?”

Only then did Guan Yu realize the middle-aged man was Takagi Ichiro, chairman of Takagi Corporation. The fact that he dared enter Watanabe Society’s stronghold accompanied solely by this woman spoke volumes about his confidence in her capabilities.

Takagi snorted coldly. “Watanabe Jiro, your Watanabe Society grows increasingly brazen! Setting aside that Sakurako is my daughter, her current status as a police officer alone should deter you. Yet I hear you’ve even employed the Soul-Locking Cage! Have you completely discarded respect for Eastern Island’s laws?”

Watanabe appeared gratified by Takagi’s anger—a testament to their longstanding rivalry. Gesturing for a beautiful woman beside him to refill his tea, he replied cheerfully, “Since you’ve investigated so thoroughly, Takagi, you must know this isn’t about your daughter. My true target is that Chinese man. Consider the facts: three of my men tried to teach him a lesson, only to inexplicably charge at a moving truck. The truck’s brakes were functional, the driver unaware of his actions—as if hypnotized. Witnesses described my men behaving similarly. Can this be unrelated to that Chinese outsider?”

Having investigated the incident himself, Takagi acknowledged its peculiarities. Yet his sole concern was retrieving his daughter; Guan Yu’s fate mattered little. Sighing, he countered, “Sakurako merely met him today during her hotel security duties. Whatever his background, she’s uninvolved. Release her to avoid mutual embarrassment.”

Watanabe shook his head. “Whether their meeting was coincidental or prearranged matters not. You know what I want.”

Gritting his teeth, Takagi produced a check. “Five million USD. Satisfactory?”

**Chapter 1718: The Brain Modification System**

Takagi assumed Watanabe’s gang, accustomed to extortion, sought easy money. Five million should suffice. Yet Watanabe didn’t snatch the check as usual. Instead, he lazily glanced up. “This isn’t about money—though we’ll take it. My true aim is the Chinese man. However...”

Takagi inwardly cursed these insatiable parasites. Preparing to write another check, he froze when Watanabe proposed, “Sign a blank check. I’ll fill the amount later—or perhaps never use it. Agreed?”

‘This is outright robbery!’ Takagi seethed. A blank check could bankrupt Takagi Corporation!

Noting Takagi’s apoplectic expression, Watanabe leaned back smugly. “Evidently, Sakurako has her price. Let’s try alternative terms. Meet my condition, and I’ll waive the five million.” He slid the check back.

Takagi’s face darkened further. When gangsters reject money, their demands spell trouble.

“The Takagi Group is a global enterprise! I won’t accept anything tarnishing our reputation! And know this—harming Sakurako carries dire consequences!”

Watanabe chuckled. “Few dare shout at me, Takagi—you’re privileged. Rest assured, we won’t kill her... though accidents happen. My men are... enthusiastic. Should they grow fond of her...”

A father’s worst nightmare. Trembling, Takagi rasped, “State your terms!”

Relieved, Watanabe lit a cigarette. “Install a small software in all Takagi communication devices. That’s all.”

Stunned, Takagi demanded, “What does it do?”

Watanabe’s gaze turned glacial. “I don’t trust you enough to explain. You have three days to decide. Refuse, and Sakurako’s safety becomes... uncertain. Matsushita, escort Mr. Takagi out.”

**Chapter 1719: Mind Another Lover?**

Takagi departed, foreboding gnawing at him. The software was clearly nefarious. Guan Yu remained, eavesdropping via astral projection—a technique from ancient Chinese martial lore, where one’s consciousness separates from the body.

The first-class mutant exhaled shakily. “Such oppressive aura! I dared not move!”

Others gasped. “A first-class mutant accompanied Takagi?”

The mutant nodded. “Had conflict erupted, none here could’ve stopped them.”

Watanabe paled. Addressing the mutant—Inoue—he explained, “We delayed because the Brain Modification System malfunctioned during testing. Ten subjects went mad. Three days should suffice for adjustments.”

Inoue frowned. “Can this system truly grant ordinary humans third-class mutant strength with absolute obedience?”

“Developed by War God Ito from divine relics,” Watanabe affirmed. “The test subjects’ power proved authentic. Our Eastern Island’s era dawns!”

Meanwhile, Guan Yu’s physical form—hidden in a basement—stiffened in shock. Astral projection typically immobilizes the body, yet Guan Yu retained partial control, his cultivation surpassing ancient masters.

Sakurako, noticing his expression, whispered, “What did you see?”

After Guan Yu explained the Brain Modification System, she cursed, “These warmongering rightists! Transforming humans into puppets—where’s the humanity?”

“Have foreign tourists gone missing?” Guan Yu pressed. “I suspect they’re test subjects. If this spreads via Takagi’s network...”

Sakurako shook her head. “No reports yet, but I’ll investigate. Perhaps they captured you for experimentation?”

Guan Yu nodded. Infiltrating their labs might reveal the system’s secrets—possibly linking to mental manipulation via the divine sense techniques he’d mastered.

Knowing Sakurako’s three-day reprieve offered limited safety, Guan Yu resolved to sabotage Watanabe’s plans, buying time for countermeasures. If taken as a test subject, he could dissect their methods firsthand.

As dawn approached, Sakurako—no longer the stern officer but an awed admirer—peppered Guan Yu with questions about his trials in the Divine Pagoda. Leaning against him, she eventually succumbed to exhaustion, her breathing softening into sleep.

Guan Yu fell silent, the basement’s gloom undisturbed by sunlight yet marked by passing hours. His mind raced—not just for Sakurako’s sake, but for the impending storm threatening to engulf nations in engineered madness.
