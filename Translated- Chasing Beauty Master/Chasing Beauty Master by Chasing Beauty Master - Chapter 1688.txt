“Ling Su, what are you trying to do?!” Guan Yu suddenly emerged from his tent, pointing accusingly at Ling Su. “Don’t act recklessly! This could kill someone—it’s no joking matter!”

“My goal is precisely to see him dead! Only his death can quench the hatred in my heart!” Ling Su sneered, completely disregarding Guan Yu’s protests. He hurled a burning stick onto Lin Chen’s tent.

The flaming stick instantly ignited the fabric. Guan Yu shouted, “Ling Su, you audacious fool! Do you realize this is murder?!”

Guan Yu lunged forward, intending to wake Lin Chen before the flames could consume him. With no water source nearby, extinguishing a full blaze would prove impossible. His loud cries roused the entire camp. Startled awake, Lin Chen discovered a charred hole in his tent and cowered in a corner, paralyzed by fear. Guan Yu rushed over, beating the flames with a piece of clothing until they subsided.

“Lin Chen, are you unharmed?” Guan Yu asked.

By now, the group had gathered around the smoldering remains of the tent. A still-smoking stick lay nearby. Lin Chen crawled out, trembling. “What happened? Why did my tent catch fire? I was so far from the campfire!”

Ling Su stood silently. Guan Yu shot him a glare, shocked by this brazen act of madness.

“It’s nothing—a stray ember must have blown over. Fortunately, I was awake and noticed it in time,” Guan Yu lied, deliberately shielding Ling Su. This calculated mercy gave Ling Su a chance to reconsider his self-destructive path.

Ling Su, now cooling from his rage, realized the insanity of his actions. Even if he’d succeeded in burning Lin Chen alive, murdering a fellow sect brother would have earned him Xuan Ming’s wrath. He glanced at Guan Yu in surprise—he’d expected his rival to revel in his downfall.

“How coincidental that only my tent caught fire!” Lin Chen trembled, realizing how close he’d come to being trapped in the inferno. “If Guan Yu hadn’t acted quickly...”

Guan Yu patted his shoulder. “Count yourself lucky. If Ling Su and I hadn’t been awake earlier, you’d be ashes now.”

Lin Chen failed to notice the incriminating stick—a clear sign of deliberate arson. “Damn, my luck’s rotten. Thank you, Guan Yu. You saved my life.”

“Don’t mention it,” Guan Yu replied cheerfully. “Sleep in my tent tonight. I’ll share Wang Jun’s.”

Through this maneuver, Guan Yu secured gratitude from both parties—Lin Chen for the rescue, Ling Su for the cover-up. Internally, he sneered. A woman’s subtle manipulations had shattered what seemed an unbreakable alliance between Ling Su and Lin Chen—such was feminine power.

After dispersing the crowd, Guan Yu discreetly tossed the evidence back into the fire. Lin Chen, ever nonchalant despite nearly dying, soon snored loudly in Guan Yu’s tent. Ling Su retreated to his quarters, plagued by mosquito bites and turmoil. Unable to sleep, he meditated to calm his mind.

In the cramped tent, Wang Jun whispered, “What really happened earlier? Were you shouting about Ling Su?”

“Quiet,” Guan Yu cautioned. “Ling Su tried to burn Lin Chen alive. Their feud has reached murderous levels.”

“Madness! If he’d maimed Xuan Ming’s prized disciple—”

“Not our concern. I’d noticed Ling Su brooding by the fire earlier. When he grabbed that flaming stick, I knew his intent.”

“Has he gone insane?”

“Lin Chen provoked him. Their rivalry over Siqi shattered their bond.” Guan Yu’s voice turned icy. “Ling Su’s arrogance couldn’t bear being bested in status, skill, and romance.”

“So you’re the puppetmaster,” Wang Jun observed. Though aligned with Guan Yu, he found the scheming unsettling.

“They brought this upon themselves. Their arrogance threatened my foothold in Yunqing Sect. This is merely the beginning—I’ll have them destroy each other completely.”

“Why protect Ling Su then? Exposing him would make them fight.”

“The timing isn’t ripe. Let their hatred fester until we’re deep in the desert. Then... let nature take its course.” Guan Yu’s chilling smile made even Wang Jun shiver.

A soft voice interrupted. “Guan Yu? Are you awake?” Siqi whispered outside.

Inviting her in, Guan Yu explained Ling Su’s arson attempt. “He’s consumed by jealousy after your rejections.”

“We must inform Sect Leader!” Siqi urged.

“Let them destroy each other,” Guan Yu dismissed. “They’re no threat to me.”

As Wang Jun tactfully exited, Siqi hesitated. “It’s improper...”

“Who cares?” Wang Jun shrugged. “Everyone knows except those two fools.”

Alone, tension filled the tent. Guan Yu gallantly offered to stand guard, but Siqi clung to his sleeve. “The mosquitoes...”

They lay side by side, hearts racing until Guan Yu embraced her. “Relax,” he murmured. “Sleep.”

Dawn found them awake before others stirred. “How did you sleep?” Guan Yu asked.

“Well,” Siqi replied, though her flushed cheeks betrayed the night’s intimacy. The game of shadows continued as the desert journey loomed—a chessboard where Guan Yu moved pawns with lethal precision.
