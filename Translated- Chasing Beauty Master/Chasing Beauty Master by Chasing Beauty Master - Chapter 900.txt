“A pass?”

Gao Shen stared in astonishment at the bloody gash across his chest, then glared at Second Only to Wolf. Thankfully, he had dodged swiftly—the blade had only grazed him shallowly. Had it struck true, Second Only to Wolf’s slash would have cleaved him in two.

Second Only to Wolf met his gaze disdainfully, as if reading the confusion in Gao Shen’s eyes. He snarled, “What’re you gawking at? I just can’t stand the sight of a pansy like you. So I hit you first. Got a problem with that?”

Gao Shen dared not breathe, let alone speak. Under Second Only to Wolf’s withering glare, he swallowed his rage along with the pain of the wound. Humiliated and seething, he knew any defiance would mean death. The man’s overwhelming strength loomed before him like an executioner’s axe.

“So you’re here to pick a fight today, aren’t you?” Kalasi’s expression flickered between fear and resolve. She knew escape was her only hope now.

“Exactly,” Guanyu replied, already moving. “We’re here to kill your men, free the captives, and burn this den of filth to the ground.”

Chaos erupted as two men faced eight. Second Only to Wolf found himself surrounded by five attackers, including Kalasi. Despite their numbers, their combined strength—bolstered by Gao Shen and Kalasi’s formidable cultivation—barely contained him.

Guanyu engaged four opponents on the other side. Jinhua scrambled to collect fallen weapons, prioritizing pistols to prevent ambushes. A’cai, meanwhile, squared off against a heavily made-up middle-aged woman wielding massive shears.

The woman’s scissors whirled with lethal grace, deflecting A’cai’s strikes at the last moment. Clearly a Second-Class Adept facing a Third-Class, she held the upper hand—until Jinhua joined the fray.

With A’cai and Jinhua now double-teaming the woman, Guanyu’s load lightened. Second Only to Wolf, though pressured by five attackers, bided his time, parrying while hunting for openings.

***Bang!***

The gunshot froze the room. Guanyu spun toward Jinhua, only to find her grinning. She’d kept a pistol hidden earlier and shot the scissors-wielder in the leg. A’cai capitalized instantly, smashing a fist into the woman’s face and sending her crashing unconscious against a wall.

Jinhua blinked at the smoking gun. “The recoil’s stronger than I thought!”

The shot rattled everyone—especially Second Only to Wolf’s attackers. Seizing their distraction, his blade flashed upward, severing Gao Shen’s left arm.

“Aaaagh!” Gao Shen’s scream echoed as he crumpled. For a First-Class Adept, even a moment’s respite could turn the tide—but Kalasi’s allies wavered, eyeing Jinhua’s erratic aim.

“Fall back!” Kalasi barked, edging toward the exit. Jinhua fired again, missing wildly as Kalasi vanished outside.

“Guanyu! She’s getting away!” Jinhua shouted.

But her warning came too late. A wet *thud* drew her gaze to Gao Shen—now slumped with a bullet in his back. She gaped at the three-meter gap between her and her unintended target.

“My… aim’s *amazing*,” she muttered.

Gao Shen, armless and bleeding out, collapsed. Second Only to Wolf noted the gunshot wound and shuddered. *That bullet nearly hit* me.

“Enough!” he roared at Jinhua. “Your shooting’s a hazard! Stop before you kill one of us!”

Jinhua pouted. “Fine, fine! I’ll stick to punching.”

As Guanyu pursued Kalasi, A’cai and Jinhua struggled against three foes. Jinhua flitted like a leaf, her uncanny agility baffling even Second Only to Wolf.

“Not fun anymore?” she taunted the retreating enemies. “I’ll help over here then!”

Darting to Second Only to Wolf’s side, her presence disrupted his attackers’ rhythm. His blade roared through a man’s chest, spraying blood.

The survivors scattered. Second Only to Wolf gave chase, cutting down two before a cry halted him—A’cai stood frozen, a sniper’s shears poised at his back.

Second Only to Wolf hurled his saber. It whistled past A’cai’s ear, impaling the attacker’s throat.

“Don’t just stand there!” Second Only to Wolf yanked his blade free. “After them!”

Outside, the traffickers fled toward vehicles. Jinhua shot out a tire, then smirked at A’cai’s awed stare. “Genius, right?”

As Second Only to Wolf hunted the stragglers, Jinhua disabled another car. The night echoed with screams and gunfire—a symphony of retribution.

Second Only to Wolf’s blade thirsted for vengeance. When a trafficker glanced at Jinhua, the saber howled through his ribs. Blood fountained as the man gaped at the hilt protruding from his chest.

“Run!” The survivors bolted.

“Oh no you don’t!” Jinhua yelled, but A’cai stood paralyzed—until the shears-wielding woman lunged again. Second Only to Wolf’s thrown blade saved him, skewering her mid-lunge.

“Move!” Second Only to Wolf roared.

Outside, Jinhua’s bullet shattered a fleeing car’s lock. Trapped, the driver cursed as alarms blared.

A’cai watched, awed, as Jinhua grinned. “Told you I’m a genius!”

Second Only to Wolf cut down two more, leaving carnage in his wake. The traffickers’ hub fell silent—save for the moans of the damned.
