The onlookers in the distance gasped in surprise. Only when the red horse knelt on the ground again did their hearts settle. This horse had never been so docile before – even when exhausted with riders on its back, it would struggle to throw them off. Never had it knelt like this.

After being subdued again, the red horse ceased its struggles, finally accepting that the person on its back couldn't be shaken off. Its fiery temperament softened.

Moments later, the stable owner stared in disbelief at the center of the training grounds. Guan Yu rode the red horse, which trotted obediently toward them.

As they approached, the owner nervously retreated, fearing the horse might suddenly go wild again. "Better keep my distance," he thought.

Noticing this, Guan Yu chuckled, "No need to fear, boss. All's well. I'll take this horse. How much silver do you want?"

Overjoyed that someone would buy such a fierce steed, the owner turned with an ingratiating smile. "Ah! You truly have remarkable skill! Anyone can see you're no ordinary man. That this horse yielded to you... well, I expected nothing less! You must know this is a prime specimen!"

Before even naming a price, the owner began extolling the horse's virtues. Guan Yu recognized a shrewd merchant when he saw one – this wouldn't be cheap. But he was ready to haggle.

"I've no time to waste here," Guan Yu said, dismounting. "Give me your lowest price. If it's fair, I'll ride off without another word."

His manner was as casual as selecting vegetables at market – no nonsense, no delays. A fair price meant an instant deal.

The owner calculated briefly. "The base cost was a hundred taels. With premium fodder and care expenses... let's say two hundred taels. Fair, no?"

"Too steep." Guan Yu immediately turned away as if abandoning the purchase.

The red horse neighed sharply, its wild energy resurfacing. The owner stumbled backward, scrambling away in panic.

"Behave. No frightening people." Guan Yu's stern command instantly subdued the horse. It stood meekly, its defiance vanishing under his gaze – tamed completely.

Guan Yu realized this was no ordinary steed. The horse displayed remarkable intelligence, almost understanding human intent. Such quality was rare, perhaps priceless.

Turning to the pale-faced owner, Guan Yu smirked. "I suspect this horse obeys only me." With a wave, he signaled the horse to return to the training area.

The red horse trotted back proudly, head held high as before.

Baffled, the owner wondered: Had this notoriously wild creature truly been conquered? If so, shouldn't others now ride it? Had its nature changed?

Previously, even skilled riders had been thrown. Some couldn't approach it at all. If it now tolerated riders, such a rare steed could fetch five hundred taels easily – a prize wealthy buyers would clamor for.

Exchanging glances with his groomer – a brother-in-law who'd worked here years – the owner silently urged him to test the horse. If anyone could ride it now, the price would double instantly.

Unaware, Guan Yu paid little attention as the groom approached the horse.

**Chapter 4067: Bargaining (Part 2)**

The groom stroked the horse's neck, pleased by its calmness. Confident, he swung onto its back – his second attempt. The first had lasted mere breaths before he was thrown.

Initially, all seemed well. The horse stood placidly as the groom waved triumphantly at the owner.

"Marvelous!" The owner beamed. "Who knew it'd turn docile? This changes everyth—"

A sudden shriek interrupted him. The red horse reared violently, hind legs slamming down to dislodge its rider. The groom clung desperately as the beast stood fully upright, front hooves clawing air, before flinging him backward.

Before the dazed man could recover, the horse spun and delivered a bone-crunching kick to his lower back, launching him meters away. The groom lay motionless.

Panicked, the owner screamed at bystanders: "Don't gawk! Fetch a physician! Now!" This groom was his last remaining – and his sister's husband.

Observing coldly, Guan Yu remarked, "Well? Selling or not? Two hundred's too high. Lower the price, or I'm leaving."

Desperate, the owner pleaded: "Sir! This steed's matchless! Where else would you find such quality? At two hundred taels, it's a steal!"

"Enough blather. Your price?" Guan Yu adopted a stern haggling tone. Privately, he knew the horse was worth five hundred – but only he could ride it. The owner's desperation was palpable.

**Chapter 4068: Bargaining (Part 3)**

"One-eighty! With premium saddle!" the owner bargained.

Guan Yu countered ruthlessly: "One hundred. Final offer."

"Preposterous!" the owner spluttered. "This breed alone...!"

"To others, it's useless. You'll end up slaughtering it for meat." Guan Yu's words struck true – maintaining this horse drained resources.

After agonized deliberation, the owner croaked: "One-fifty. Not a tael less."

Without word, Guan Yu turned to leave.

"Wait!" The owner's cry halted him. "One-twenty! With saddle!"

"Done." Guan Yu smirked, victorious. The red horse trotted over obediently, sealing the deal. Its eyes gleamed with recognition – it had chosen its master.
