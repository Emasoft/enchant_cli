"Guan Yu's words—what did they mean? Was this a hint?" Gao Wei pondered inwardly.

Chirp...chirp...

Just as Guan Yu prepared to act, Little Black took initiative. Flapping its wings, it charged forward first.

Guan Yu halted, staring at Little Black in astonishment. Curiosity flickered across his face as he crossed his arms, refraining from action.

Roar!

The ferocious wolf, as if provoked, lunged with bared fangs.

Chirp...

Little Black extended its claws, choosing direct confrontation. Its speed was lightning-fast, claws razor-sharp. Before the wolf could touch it, a pained howl echoed—blood gushed from holes in the wolf's skull.

After two furious growls, the wolf fled.

Guan Yu shuddered.

*Damn, Little Black's even fiercer than its father.*

“Little Black, chase!” Guan Yu exclaimed excitedly.

Chirp...

Little Black responded and pursued.

Guan Yu pulled Gao Wei along.

They stopped at a cave entrance but hesitated to enter deeper.

Guan Yu sensed something amiss.

**Chapter 817: Perils Abound**

Deep in the mountains, Guan Yu and Gao Wei stood at the cave entrance. Little Black perched on Guan Yu’s shoulder.

The irregular cave mouth, surrounded by rubble from tectonic shifts, revealed a hidden passage. A chilling wind whistled through the pitch-black depths.

Guan Yu frowned, peering into the darkness.

They’d chased the wolf here, but its agonized howl from within halted them.

Using his detection system, Guan Yu scanned the cave. The artificially carved passage stretched impossibly deep.

*There’s something here.*

The cave’s secrecy suggested hidden treasures.

“Are you planning to enter?” Gao Wei asked nervously.

“Yes. I want to see how deep it goes.”

Gao Wei paled. “But the danger—”

“I’m more reliable than that wolf.”

Reluctantly, Gao Wei followed.

The pitch-black tunnel reeked of mildew. Gao Wei clung to Guan Yu, trembling.

*Crack!*

A faint sound made Guan宇 leap forward, dragging Gao维 down a slope as wooden spikes rained behind them.

*Boom!*

Debris settled. Gao维 lay unconscious.

“Poison gas!”

Guan宇’s copper pendant vibrated, clearing his mind. He sprinted for the exit with Gao维 and Little Black.

**Chapter 818: Escape**

Fresh air greeted them. Exhausted, Guan宇 collapsed.

Gao维’s face turned black—deadly poison. Guan宇 channeled healing energy into her.

Hours later, she stabilized.

Little Black lay lifeless.

*Thud-thud-thud!*

Helicopters roared above.

“Here! Over here!” Guan宇 waved.

**Chapter 819: Return**

At a military airfield, three women awaited anxiously.

Towering figures in uniforms stood behind them—political heavyweights’ aides.

“Why did Grandpa send *you*?” Wen Qing whispered to a middle-aged man.

He smiled. “The Chairman has high hopes for this young man.”
