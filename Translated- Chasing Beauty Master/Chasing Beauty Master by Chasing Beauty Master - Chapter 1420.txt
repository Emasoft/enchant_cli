“Ah Xiao added, ‘Exactly. If not for the three of you coming here, no one would have uncovered my murder method. Those idiots at the yamen—even if they spent a lifetime investigating—could never have found any clues. Perhaps this is my fate. I can’t blame anyone else.’”

Guan Yu hadn’t expected Ah Xiao to hold the yamen in such contempt. After cursing them earlier, he still wasn’t done. Magistrate Zhou thought to himself, *There are still common folk present. I can’t let this brat spout nonsense here.* Otherwise, the yamen’s authority would crumble entirely. He bellowed, “Guards! Bind this murderer and take him to the yamen to await judgment!”

Several soldiers stepped forward and tightly restrained Ah Xiao, who offered no resistance. Guan Yu could see the despair in Ah Xiao’s eyes—no lingering hopes remained. With his brother’s vengeance fulfilled, he had no regrets left.

Wang Xiaorong whispered into Guan Yu’s ear, “Guan Yu, I’m starting to feel a bit sorry for this Ah Xiao.”

Guan Yu coldly replied, “The pitiable often have their own despicable sides. Since he chose to kill and went through with it, he deserves punishment. Such people aren’t worth pity.”

“That’s not fair. At least he avenged his brother. If his brother hadn’t been killed, he wouldn’t have resorted to murder.”

“You’re right. If my brother were killed, I might also seek revenge. Of course, killers aren’t necessarily evil, but once they act, they must bear the consequences. Clearly, he was prepared to accept them long ago.”

Yue Gao approached Guan Yu and gave him a thumbs-up. “Guan Yu, you’re incredible! To deduce such a murder method—I need to learn from you.”

“You’re already highly skilled. There’s nothing I can teach you. Didn’t you also figure out the method?”

“I suspected it, but even I doubted the elaborate setup. Besides, I couldn’t confirm Ah Xiao was the killer—whereas you did. That’s your strength.”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Don’t flatter me. Magistrate Zhou will likely ask us to give statements at the yamen. As we agreed earlier, I’ll leave that to you. I have urgent matters—my friends are waiting at the inn. I need to return soon. However, there’s something I need your help with.”

“My help?” Yue Gao grinned. “What could you possibly need from me? Go on, tell me.”

Guan Yu lowered his voice. “Since you’re on good terms with Magistrate Zhou, could you borrow a horse from him? Xiaorong and I need to descend the mountain immediately. My friends at the inn might grow anxious.”

“Such a trivial matter? Consider it done. Wait here—I’ll fetch you a swift horse.” Yue Gao turned but added, “When will we meet again?”

“If fate allows, I believe we’ll reunite soon.” Guan Yu smiled.

Yue Gao knew Guan Yu had pressing matters and didn’t press further. When Guan Yu and Wang Xiaorong returned to the inn, they headed straight to Yan Zhao’s room.

“This guy’s still asleep? At this hour, we’ll have to wait until tomorrow to depart,” Guan Yu remarked.

Wang Xiaorong nodded. “It’s already dinnertime. Perhaps Yan Zhao’s stomach troubled him, hence the long rest. Anyway, we can’t leave tonight. Let’s not wake him. We haven’t eaten all day—my stomach’s growling.”

“Then let’s fill our bellies first.”

The two went downstairs and ordered food. While eating, Guan Yu noticed a man in the corner glancing repeatedly at them before nervously looking away.

Wang Xiaorong had seen him too but chose to ignore him. Now that Guan Yu noticed, she sighed. “He’s from the Demon Soul Sect. Sent by my father, no doubt.”

Guan Yu said, “Xiaorong, that man seems suspicious. Be cautious.”

“No need. He’s a Demon Soul Sect member. I spotted him earlier. Father probably wants me to return—which would ruin our plans. I’m not going back.” Wang Xiaorong waved at the man, who hurried over without formal greetings. “Speak plainly,” she ordered.

After glancing at Guan Yu, the man whispered, “The Demon Lord sends word: The Red Lotus Sect and True Sun Sect are tracking you. Be cautious.”

**Chapter 3,690: Wrong Path**

“That’s all?” Wang Xiaorong skeptically asked. “Nothing else?” She doubted her father would send a trusted messenger for such minor news.

“The Demon Lord also advises you to return to the sect. The outside world is too dangerous,” the man added.

“Hah! I knew Father would say that. Tell him I won’t return. With Guan Yu here, I’m safe. He needn’t worry.” She waved dismissively, and the man left without another word.

Guan Yu watched him depart. “A Demon Soul Sect member? Why skulk around? Why not approach directly?”

“Without my summons, he dares not. It’s protocol—unlike your chaotic Cloud Azure Sect.” Wang Xiaorong huffed. “You heard him—the Red Lotus and True Sun Sects are tailing us, likely to follow us to Miao City. They’ll let us chart their path.”

“The Red Lotus and True Sun Sects? Aren’t they righteous? Would they stoop so low?”

“You still don’t see the true face of the righteous.” Wang Xiaorong smirked. “Following others is their specialty. Your Cloud Azure Sect leaks information alarmingly fast—you’ve barely left, yet news spreads far and wide.”

Guan Yu frowned. “How should I know? I’m unfamiliar with Cloud Azure’s workings. Why blame them? Couldn’t the Demon Soul Sect have leaked it?”

“Preposterous! Would my father want enemies trailing me? Obviously not.”

“True. I’ve never encountered True Sun members, but Red Lotus vermin aren’t worth concern.”

“Don’t underestimate them. Though weak in cultivation, their underhanded tactics are insidious. We must replan our route.”

Guan Yu nodded. “We can’t let them piggyback on our efforts. If we find Miao City, we’d be sewing bridal clothes for others. We must shake them off.”

“There are ways. In the desert, they’ll have to follow from afar. Once there, losing them will be simple.”

“Agreed. Let’s take detours tomorrow instead of heading straight. More entertaining that way.”

After dinner, they strolled through the town. Wang Xiaorong mused, “Delaying like this—won’t your Cloud Azure Sect disapprove?”

“Circumstances forced it. If your Left Envoy finds Miao City first, we’ll avoid the desert altogether.”

“Wishful thinking! Even if they locate it, they’ll wait until the fifteenth day of the seventh month. You’ll get no information. We must find it ourselves.”

Guan Yu’s hopeful idea shattered. As they passed the Wan residence, they saw Wan Guocai escorting Yu Qingtian into a carriage. “With Magistrate Wan dead and his wife arrested, that young master rules the household now,” Guan Yu observed.

“He’ll marry whomever he pleases—no one left to stop him.”

“The remaining elder won’t interfere—senile as he is. The Wan household will decline under that spoiled heir’s rule.”

Wang Xiaorong changed the subject. “Earlier at the temple—didn’t Magistrate Zhou seem unwell?”

“He claimed a chill, but his pallor suggested worse. Yue Gao recovered quickly, but Magistrate Zhou’s age worsens it. He looked sixty.”

“I think the market’s this way,” Wang Xiaorong pointed left.

Having ridden in Yue Gao’s carriage last time, Guan Yu was unsure. “No, it should be this direction.”

“Are you certain? Let’s ask someone.” A passerby directed them northwest.

“See? My intuition was right,” Guan Yu boasted.

Wang Xiaorong rolled her eyes but then spotted Yue Gao ahead. “Fate reunites us!” Guan Yu laughed.

Yue Gao grinned. “Shopping? Or here for me?”

“Just wandering. What brings you?”

“Magistrate Zhou made me document both cases—the recent murder and Ah Gong’s three-year-old death. Took forever! Now I’m buying a carriage. What luck meeting you!”

Guan Yu asked, “Notice Magistrate Zhou’s poor health?”

“Yes. He blames a chill, but his pallor and sweating… Could it be poison?”

“Poison?!” Yue Gao paled. “Accusing someone of poisoning an official—that’s a capital offense!”

“Merely speculation. Chronic poison, perhaps. The killer’s clever—using the chaos to hide evidence. Without treatment, Magistrate Zhou won’t last.”

Yue Gao worried. “Should we warn him?”

“He’d dismiss us as nuisances. Let’s focus on your carriage. If you solve this, your fame will soar.”

“This is no jest! A man’s life hangs in balance!”

“Not our affair. The killer’s someone close, long-planning. Untangling this would take ages. We leave for the desert tomorrow.”

Yue Gao sighed. “I pray you’re wrong.”

Guan Yu shrugged. “Fate decides. Let’s find your carriage.”
