“Great, I’ll follow your arrangements. Your friend is named Jinciyu Lang (Second Only to Waves)? That name sounds so domineering, hehe,” Lan Yu said playfully.

After turning on his phone, Guanyu’s first thought was to call Xue Jing to reassure her. Otherwise, he’d face her wrath upon returning.

Xue Jing had just finished showering when her phone, left on the bed, suddenly rang. Seeing Guanyu’s number, she quickly answered and asked cautiously, “Hello? Guanyu, where are you?”

Though her voice sounded calm, Xue Jing was seething inside, unsure if Guanyu was in trouble.

Guanyu chuckled, “Jingjing, it’s me. My phone died earlier, so I had to turn it off. I’m with Lan Yu now, so don’t worry.”

Xue Jing had been ready to unleash a torrent of anger upon hearing Guanyu was safe, but she bit her tongue upon learning Lan Yu was nearby.

“Hello, Sister Jingjing!” Lan Yu called out loudly.

**Chapter 2401: Communication Barriers**

Xue Jing refrained from scolding him precisely because she knew to preserve Guanyu’s dignity in front of others—a principle every woman should uphold. No matter a man’s mistakes, saving face in public was paramount.

“Oh? How did you end up with Lan Yu?” Xue Jing asked with forced calm. Guanyu sensed trouble but trusted her to maintain composure around others.

“Lan Yu and I are traveling for a few days. I’ll return soon—don’t worry,” Guanyu said before abruptly hanging up.

Xue Jing’s protest died as the dial tone buzzed. Fuming, she thought, *I’ve followed you everywhere, yet you take someone else on a trip? Unbelievable!*

**Chapter 2402: Half-Dead Beatings**

Amei, preparing dinner, noticed Xue Jing’s open door and found her red-faced and furious on a stool.

“Sister Jing, what’s wrong? Did the others find out Guanyu’s missing?” Amei assumed the others had blamed Xue Jing.

“Who cares about that scoundrel? Where he goes is none of my business! I can’t control him!” Xue Jing snapped.

Amei sat beside her, soothing, “Don’t be angry. Getting upset only hurts you.”

“I’m not angry for *his* sake! I’m not!” Xue Jing retorted.

“Then why?”

Reluctantly, Xue Jing vented, “Guanyu went off with Lan Yu! After I’ve trailed him everywhere, he takes *her* on a trip? It’s infuriating!”

Amei chuckled, “Let’s teach him a lesson when he returns. For now, staying angry won’t bring him back.” Privately, she worried—Lan Yu, a non-cultivator, might endanger Guanyu if trouble arose.

“How can I not worry? Taking Lanyu into danger—what if something happens?” Xue Jing fumed.

Amei suggested, “If they’re nearby, it’s fine. Let’s make him take *us* on a trip later.”

“Hmph! He’d never think of us!” Xue Jing pouted.

“We’ll force him. Together, we’ll handle him. Did you ask where they went?”

“He hung up before I could!”

**Chapter 2403: Reunited at Last**

Amei stood. “I’ll make dinner. Join me if you’d like.”

“I’ll help,” Xue Jing muttered, following.

Meanwhile, Guanyu called Jinciyu Lang. “Brother Lang, I’m at the airport. How far are you?”

“You’re here? The airport’s an hour away. I’ll pick you up!” Jinciyu replied excitedly, thinking of Sakurako.

“I’ll grab a meal while waiting,” Guanyu said.

To Lan Yu, he remarked, “Looks like we’ll need your translation app.”

“Let’s eat!” Lan Yu cheered.

The airport’s outskirts brimmed with unfamiliar shops and neon signs. Guanyu spotted a McDonald’s. “Let’s eat there—no translation needed.”

Inside, Guanyu pointed to menu pictures, simplifying their order. Lan Yu paid, as Guanyu’s card didn’t work locally.

Mid-meal, Yang Conghan called. “Guanyu, Xue Jing said you’re with Lan Yu. Was this planned?”

“We met by chance on the same flight,” Guanyu lied.

Yang updated him: Xue Jing had confronted a lecherous deputy director, whom Yang had demoted and beaten half-dead.

“Good. But… did you tell Xue Jing my plans?” Guanyu asked.

“No, but she’s furious. Return soon.”

After hanging up, Guanyu and Lan Yu wandered outside. A crowd gathered across the street—a woman and child arguing with a man.

Lan Yu shouted a translated, “Whose wallet is lost?” causing onlookers to scatter. They squeezed through to find a mother accusing a man of harassing her 12-year-old daughter on a bus.

The man pleaded innocence, offering compensation, but the mother demanded police intervention. The crowd, initially passive, now blocked his escape.

Guanyu grimaced—disgusted by the man’s actions but trapped in the throng.
