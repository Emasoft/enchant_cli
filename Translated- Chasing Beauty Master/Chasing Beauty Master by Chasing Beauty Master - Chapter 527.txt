Guan Yu swept his gaze across the assembled crowd, noting their curious stares as if he were some shape-shifting magician. Only Locke met him with a venomous glance before addressing the gathering: "Esteemed friends, I've heard dragonkind can assume draconic form. Let Young Master Guan Yu grace us with this marvel!"

Rage simmered in Guan Yu's veins. Only now did he realize Locke's cunning – this trap left no escape. "Honored guests," he countered, "weightier matters demand our attention. The transformation can wait."

Allen swiftly intervened, sensing Guan Yu's predicament. "Indeed, our agenda holds pressing business. Let our chieftain proceed." As Allen began speaking, Locke cut through with a raised hand. "Brother Guan, this evasion ill becomes you!"

Chapter 1334: Draconic Metamorphosis

Though Guan Yu sought no conflict, Locke mistook restraint for cowardice. The elf leader's relentless provocation strained Guan Yu's composure until Allen's subtle touch restrained him. Violence now would jeopardize their plans.

"Commander Locke," Guan Yu ground out, "you truly crave this spectacle?"

The elf smiled. "We elves revere dragonkind. A demonstration would strengthen our alliance." His honeyed words dripped with mockery.

Guan Yu's jaw tightened. "How flattering that my humble self sways interracial relations!" Only Allen's grip prevented him lunging at the smirking elf.

"Enough delays!" Locke declared. "Either transform or confess your fraud!"

The crowd erupted. "Show us!" cried an ancient voice. "Five centuries I've waited to behold a dragon!"

Cornered, Guan Yu felt a tug at his trousers. Bika Mao stared up with wide eyes. "Not now, pest!" Guan Yu hissed. The persistent cat whispered urgently: "Perform theatrics. I'll handle the dragon illusion. Hurry – Amy's searching for me!"

Though skeptical, desperation forced compliance. "Fail me," Guan Yu warned, "and you'll regret it!" Facing the crowd, he proclaimed: "You seek proof against slanderers? Behold!"

Closing his eyes, Guan Yu waved arms in meaningless patterns. Murmurs spread until purple energy coalesced behind him – a towering dragon specter that roared before dissolving. Gasps filled the air.

Chapter 1335: Reversed Fortunes

Locke's triumph curdled to ashes. His scheme had crowned Guan Yu a hero instead of exposing him. Allen seized the moment: "This alliance with dragonkind ensures our strength against humanity!"

The crowd's adulation sickened Locke. His rival now basked in glory, Amy's doting gaze twisting the knife. Every calculation had backfired.

When Guan Yu turned the inquisition, Locke squirmed. "Mere... precautionary concerns," he stammered.

"Precautions?" Guan Yu pressed. "Your 'Gu poison' accusations required evidence. Care to explain?"

Before Locke could counter, Allen intervened: "Commander acted from vigilance. Now, greater tidings!" The assembly stilled.

Chapter 1336: Best of Three?

"Recent events prove Guan Yu's valor. Yet our trials continue. I propose..." Allen's voice carried new steel, but Guan Yu's attention lingered on Locke's seething face. This game wasn't over.
