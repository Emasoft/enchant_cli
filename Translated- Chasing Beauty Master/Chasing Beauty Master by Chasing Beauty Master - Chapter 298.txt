Another crisp sound rang out. This time, Ji Chengfeng struck Wen Ya. Due to excessive force, a trickle of blood seeped from Wen Ya's lips. Yet she showed no signs of weakness, glaring fiercely at Ji Chengfeng as she swung another slap at him. However, Ji Chengfeng, already prepared, caught her wrist firmly.

"Hmph, trying to act tough? Do you think you can outplay me?" Ji Chengfeng sneered, his lecherous gaze sweeping over Wen Ya's body. He licked his lips. "If you're really a virgin, let me be the one to pop your cherry."

After speaking, he tore at Wen Ya's blouse but was stopped by someone.

"Chengfeng, don't go too far. The owner of this bar isn't someone you can afford to provoke," said the man who had first mocked Ji Chengfeng earlier, blocking him with a frown.

"Just having fun with a woman. I don't think Luo Cheng would let this ruin relations with my father. Today, I'll show you all a live sex show!" Ji Chengfeng snorted coldly, pushing Lu Yi aside.

At that moment, Wen Ya executed a groin kick combined with the sharp weapon of her high heels, directly crushing Ji Chengfeng's testicles.

"Aoooowww!!!"

Having struck first, Ji Chengfeng had no time to react. Clutching his crotch, he howled in agony.

Seizing the moment, Wen Ya dashed toward the door.

"Bitch! Stop her!" Ji Chengfeng roared, his lungs nearly bursting with rage. When had he ever been humiliated like this by a woman?

Sighing softly, Lu Yi blocked Wen Ya's path. Regardless of circumstances, he and Ji Chengfeng had grown up together. Both reason and sentiment dictated he side with Chengfeng. Moreover, this woman had exploited their conversation to ambush Ji Chengfeng, irritating Lu Yi.

"Fuck! Today I'll not only pop your cherry but have you gang-raped to death!" Ji Chengfeng laughed maniacally, suddenly kicking toward Wen Ya's abdomen.

"Aaaaahhhh!!!"

The piercing screams echoed through the private room, momentarily drowning out the heavy metal music outside.

The one screaming wasn't Wen Ya, but Ji Chengfeng. His leg bent at a grotesque 90-degree angle as he flew backward, crashing to the floor.

The sudden scene left everyone stunned. Was this a movie? The martial arts displayed were too extraordinary.

But seeing Ji Chengfeng's injuries, all eyes turned fearfully toward the newcomer.

"It's you again?" Wen Ya exclaimed.

Chapter 755: Wrath

Dogs biting dogs, each mouthful of fur. Of course, this was between equals. Between unequals, only bullying remained.

Seeing the young man who suddenly burst in, Lu Yi didn't consider him arrogant but enjoyed watching the drama unfold.

"Did you participate in what just happened?" Guan Yu asked Lu Yi abruptly.

"Perhaps you should worry about your own situation," Lu Yi sneered.

"It seems you were involved." Guan Yu leaned back comfortably on the sofa, mockingly eyeing Lu Yi. He pulled out his phone and commanded, "Come here. There's a situation."

Lu Yi, a prideful young master, couldn't endure Guan Yu's mocking gaze. "Calling reinforcements? Go ahead - you'll only harm others."

Guan Yu ignored him, playing with his phone.

Nothing is more intolerable than blatant disrespect.

Soon, Luo Cheng arrived. Seeing the situation, he stood quietly awaiting Guan Yu's orders.

"Officer, it's here! Someone attempted assault and violence. My friend is inside..." Wen Yal's words trailed off as she saw only Guan Yu and two others remained.

"Miss, I told you this venue's security doesn't require police. There's no disturbance here," a policeman said dismissively.

Noticing Luo Cheng, the officer brightened. "Chief Luo! We came because this lady insisted. Obviously mistaken."

After brief exchanges, the police left. Wen Yal overheard their whispers - "That's Guan Yu, the ultimate boss?"

She stared in shock. The legendary backer her colleagues mentioned was here.

"I thought you abandoned me again. Turns out you called police. I misjudged you," Guan Yu smiled.

Wen Yal glared. "You saved me, I saved you. We're even. But don't expect forgiveness for costing me my job."

"Actually... wasn't it me who saved you?" Guan Yu corrected.

"You caused this! Without you, I wouldn't have taken this job and met those perverts!" Wen Yal's eyes reddened.

Guilt washed over Guan Yu. "Wait! If safety's the issue, let me fix it. Stay, and I'll ensure this never happens again."

"How?" Wen Yal scoffed.

"From this moment, you're promoted to manager. Double salary, full authority over staff safety. Any issues, report directly to me."

Wen Yal stared. "Who are you?"

"Your new boss." Guan Yu smiled. "Stay, and I'll show you real security."

Chapter 756: Internal Rectification

After resolving the disturbance, Guan Yu addressed internal issues. "Double security. Train staff in self-defense. Zero tolerance for harassment. Any violation - immediate dismissal."

His reforms spread through the bar. Staff morale lifted, safety measures strengthened.

Chapter 757: Mo Ling Returns

As Guan Yu left, a familiar figure entered - Mo Ling, his former flame. Her return would bring new challenges, but Guan Yu stood ready. The game had just begun.
