“You’re clearly threatening and manipulating them. Their only choice now is to become cannon fodder for you. Your scheming is truly impressive,” Guan Yu sneered coldly. “But don’t forget—we’re still here. I’ve decided to help the Gaoshan Sect wipe you out. Not just you, but the entire Gute Clan as well. I won’t let scum like you continue poisoning minds here.”

“Ridiculous! Where do you get such audacity? Do you truly believe our Gute Clan fears you? Is this how your mother taught you to strut around arrogantly?”

Guan Yu’s expression darkened. Without another word, he strode forward and kicked the man squarely in the stomach, sending him flying back into the crowd.

“Let that be your lesson. Insults have limits. One more word, and I guarantee you won’t live to see the next minute.” His icy glare sent shivers through everyone present—foes and allies alike.

Nothing enraged Guan Yu more than insults dragging his loved ones or elders into the fray. Such disrespect was unforgivable.

The crowd stood stunned. Many hadn’t even seen the movement—only the result as the man was hurled backward. Guan Yu’s speed, combined with their proximity, left no time for reaction.

Now, fear gripped not just the Gute Clan but even the Gaoshan Sect. Their young master inwardly thanked the heavens the kick hadn’t landed on him, grateful he’d hesitated to comply earlier. His uncle had been right—this man’s capabilities were unfathomable. Recklessness meant doom.

Heeding elders truly brought safety. The kicked man couldn’t rise, requiring two supporters to lift him. With such power, who in the Gaoshan Sect could resist? Numbers meant nothing—this single man could annihilate them all without chance of retaliation. They’d be mere targets.

The victim felt his guts churn, pain wracking his sweat-drenched body into near-collapse. Speechless, let alone defiant, he trembled in terror. Guan Yu had crossed meters unseen—how?

Even Xiao Mei marveled at Guan Yu’s prowess. Smiling, she remarked, “I warned you this was self-inflicted misery. Regrets now? Had you let us pass peacefully, you’d have avoided this. Those silver notes tempted you, but greed requires capability. How’s the taste of consequence?”

As Guan Yu’s gaze swept the crowd, both sides instinctively retreated. The Gaoshan elder nodded—this was no ordinary man. From demeanor to his superior magical artifacts, excellence radiated. A mere display had cowed all present. Best not make enemies here.

Si Qi approached Guan Yu. “Don’t waste anger on them. We should move on—lingering here gains nothing.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Consider yourself fortunate today. But mark this—the Gute Clan and I now share enmity. If fate allows, I’ll visit your clan to settle accounts… slowly.”

As they departed, Xiao Mei sidled up curiously. “Old Guan, you’re full of surprises! That kick—satisfying?”

Though aware of Guan Yu’s dual mastery of martial and magical arts, Xiao Mei hadn’t grasped its full implications. To her, it meant close combat prowess and spellcasting range, but the depths remained mysterious.

“He insulted; I disciplined. A warning to others demands spectacle. Shouldn’t I honor the Jiayi Sect’s reputation?” Guan Yu jested.

“Hah! Well said! You’ve got promise, boosting our sect’s prestige. I’ll move Jiayi Sect to the martial world someday. Thoughts?”

“Possible. But the jianghu’s harsher than deserts. There, you’d be mere mountain bandits—despised by all.”

**Chapter 4591: Avoiding Trouble**

Guan Yu continued, “True villains congregate under the Demon Soul Sect—the supreme demonic faction. They’d never tolerate rival ‘evil’ sects like ours tarnishing their infamy.”

“Is this Demon Soul Sect truly formidable?” Xiao Mei asked, familiar with the name but not its might.

“Undoubtedly,” Guan Yu affirmed. “They’re the jianghu’s greatest demonic power, unmatched save by the Yunqing Sect’s righteousness. Their forces rival each other.”

“So they challenge Yunqing Sect directly?”

“Not exactly,” interjected Si Qi. “Though strong with a mighty Demon Lord, they’re no match for Yunqing’s virtue. We abhor slaughter—if demons refrain from excess, mercy prevails.”

Guan Yu shook his head silently. Si Qi’s belief in Yunqing’s invincibility was naive. Even Master Xuanming with the Dragon-Slaying Sword might lose to the Demon Lord. Had Yunqing possessed true confidence, they’d have eradicated the sect long ago. Current stalemate proved mutual deterrence.

“Yunqing’s greatness is clear,” Xiao Mei conceded, eyeing Guan Yu. “If I lead Jiayi Sect to the jianghu, your protection would deter trouble.”

“You overestimate me,” Guan Yu deflected. “I’m a nobody there. But should you venture forth, I’ll aid financially as a friend.”

**Chapter 4592: Refusing to Rescue**

At their campsite, Si Qi confessed unease: “Nearing Miao City, this emptiness grows…”

“It’s fear,” Guan Yu comforted. “But I’ll safeguard us—even if we leave empty-handed.”

Xiao Mei interjected, “Legends say none returned from Miao City’s last appearance years ago. Will fortune favor us?”

Guan Yu pondered. Previous visitors lacked their current purpose—the Eight-Drum Manual and Meng Hua’s tomb. Why had they entered? The mystery gnawed at him.

Dawn came. As they prepared, Xiao Mei noted pursuers—the Crimson Lotus Sect.

“Their tracking skills impress,” Guan Yu remarked before a distant cry pierced the air.

A man sank in quicksand begged mercy. Guan Yu hovered above, unmoved. “Should I save a spy? Blame your luck.”

The plea faded as sand consumed the man.

“Was he Crimson Lotus?” Si Qi asked. “We should’ve—”

“Unsaveable,” Guan Yu cut in. “The desert claims as it wills.”

As Si Qi recalled her childhood brush with quicksand, Guan Yu explained, “Quicksand forms when underground water destabilizes sand. Rainfall worsens it. Most traps halt at waist-depth, but some… devour whole.”

Xiao Mei nodded. “A disciple once survived chest-deep. We thought him lost, but the sinking stopped.”

The group pressed on, the desert’s dangers ever-present.
