The injuries of Yingshan Gu had long since healed. Her absence these days was due to her travels abroad, where she swindled wealthy individuals using poison techniques and gu worm manipulation. Having amassed considerable wealth by deceiving several magnates, she aimed to bid for the treasure map with her ill-gotten gains.

Having returned to City A only yesterday, Yingshan Gu was infuriated to learn that the prodigal Feitian Lang had sold the treasure map to Bill Lin for a mere fifteen million. To Feitian Lang, this seemed a prudent choice—securing a safe transaction to fund his leisurely retirement.

But Yingshan Gu's ambitions dwarfed his. Millions meant nothing to her; she could effortlessly swindle such sums from the rich. The true prize was the treasure map. She dreamed of assembling all fragments to unearth the legendary hoard and become the wealthiest woman in Huaxia. Current gains were mere trifles compared to that destiny.

Zhiyu Lang's suspicions were correct—Yingshan Gu harbored such grand designs. Yet her mastery of disguise left no visible flaws unless meticulously scrutinized. Watching Feitian Lang raise his bidding paddle again, she deduced he acted as Bill Lin's proxy. "How else would this pauper have such funds?" she scoffed.

"Thirty-six million!" Feitian Lang shouted. Onlookers gaped—this former beggar, suddenly flush after selling the map, now recklessly escalated bids for his patron.

Yingshan Gu grew impatient. The gu worms inside her voraciously consumed her blood. If she didn't depart soon to expel them, blood loss would force her true form to emerge, leaving her vulnerable. "Forty million!" Her bid drew astonished stares. The obese stranger's origins became the crowd's buzzing speculation—an unknown merchant? A mysterious newcomer?

"Forty million! Do I hear higher bids?" The auctioneer's drone betrayed his satisfaction. This price already exceeded expectations.

"Forty-one million..." Feitian Lang drawled,挑衅地 glaring at Yingshan Gu. Bill Lin's five-million ceiling emboldened him—he'd either secure the map or bleed competitors dry.

Yingshan Gu's forehead glistened. Zhiyu Lang's sudden "Forty-five million!" bid made her shudder. This surpassed her limits. Defeated, she lumbered up, her bloated disguise exacerbating blood-drained weakness. Though Guan Yu noticed her odd exit from backstage, neither he nor Zhiyu Lang recognized the fleeing impostor.

"Forty-six million!" Feitian Lang crowed after her departure, envisioning four million embezzled from Bill Lin's coffers. But Zhiyu Lang's "Forty-nine million!" interjection at the final hammer strike shattered his glee.

"Fifty million!" Feitian Lang roared, hitting his limit. Zhiyu Lang smirked—exactly as Guan Yu predicted. When the gavel fell, Feitian Lang clutched the map case while shooting murderous glares. Outside, Zhiyu Lang baited him: "Five million—was that your master's leash?"

The confrontation escalated. "You think you're some 'Sky-Soaring Wolf'?" Zhiyu Lang sneered. "More like a Sky-Pissing Dog!" As Feitian Lang lunged, his three bodyguards watched helplessly. The enraged bandit chased his tormentor, unaware Guan Yu had already ordered his elimination.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu and Xue Jing departed to check on Shuangshuang's tutoring arrangements. With school approaching, injured gang members received academic support—seven youths would study under hired teachers. Such gestures deepened the Yu Gang's loyalty.

As Zhiyu Lang taunted Feitian Lang into reckless pursuit, Guan Yu's trap snapped shut. The self-styled "Top Ten Villain" never noticed the shadows closing in until it was too late.
