“What’s the reason?” Niu Le’s attention had long drifted from Guan Yu to the gambling table. This was his first time betting such astronomical sums in his life – how could he not be excited?

“Because I don’t know how to play Show Hand. Just sit beside me and tell me if my cards are good or not.” Guan Yu shrugged nonchalantly.

“What? What did you say?” Niu Le practically leaped from his chair, voice cracking. “You don’t know Show Hand?”

His shout echoed through the room, drawing curious glances from others.

“Lower your voice! You’re giving us away,” Guan Yu said with a bitter smile.

Though simple-minded, Niu Le wasn’t stupid. After calming down, he slumped back into his seat and hissed, “Dammit Boss, are you joking? Why gamble if you don’t even know the rules?”

“Easy now.” Guan Yu waved dismissively, looking slightly embarrassed. “I’ve heard of Show Hand from those God of Gamblers movies. Just never actually played it.”

When gambling films swept the nation, Show Hand became legendary – mountains of cash pushed all-in with theatrical flair. Guan Yu knew the concept but lacked practical knowledge. Still, he understood basics like using playing cards. Otherwise, he’d never have dared stake fifty million.

Niu Le’s face darkened. Calling Guan Yu a gambling rookie would be generous – at least rookies knew the rules. Their boss didn’t even understand the game mechanics.

“We’re doomed. This fifty million might as well be charity,” Niu Le groaned, clutching his chest dramatically.

Guan Yu snorted. “My luck’s no joke. Don’t count me out yet.”

“Women are trouble,” Niu Le sighed, ignoring Guan Yu’s confidence.

The boss flicked his subordinate’s forehead. “You’re lecturing me about women? Look who’s talking.”

Rubbing his head, Niu Le glanced around furtively. “Boss, while they’re distracted... maybe we should slip out?”

“No.” Guan Yu crossed his arms stubbornly. Clearly, Niu Le had zero faith in his chances.

Growing desperate, Niu Le splayed his fingers. “Boss! Fifty million! With that money, you could have any girl! Why obsess over this one?”

Guan Yu stayed silent. He wasn’t here for romance – this was strategic. Chu Hong’s background remained unshared. Knowing Niu Le’s temper, revealing her connections might send him charging with a cleaver. Some threats required subtlety.

As Niu Le fumbled for his phone to cancel the money transfer, Luo Cheng arrived with a briefcase. Too late. The die was cast.

“All three million here, Boss.” Luo Cheng shook the case nervously. Guan Yu’s enterprises needed liquidity – this gamble could cripple their growth.

“Relax. You’ll have it back tonight with interest,” Guan Yu promised, though both subordinates exchanged doubtful looks.

Chapter 592: Forced into the Spotlight

The Emperor wasn’t anxious, but his eunuchs were. Hearing Guan Yu’s incompetence, loyal Niu Le panicked. Yet Luo Cheng’s efficiency thwarted intervention – the funds arrived moments later.

As Chu Hong ushered them to the table, Niu Le whispered last-minute rules: “Minimum ante 100k. Bet after each card. Highest visible hand acts first.”

Guan Yu nodded, accepting his first card – a measly Three of Clubs. The coal tycoon Mr. Ma sneered at his Q-3-7-2 spread. “Dreaming of another deuce? Wishful thinking, idiot.”

Niu Le exploded. “Who you calling idiot, you fat pervert? I’ll cut you–”

“Enough!” Chu Hong intervened, her honeyed voice pacifying tempers. “Let’s maintain decorum, gentlemen.”

Guan Yu observed coldly. Her delayed mediation was deliberate – stoking conflict. A pawn in her game? He’d play along... for now.

Chapter 593: Victory

Final card dealt, tensions peaked. Sun revealed two Ks and two As. Guan Yu hadn’t checked his hole card.

“Boss! Look at your damn cards!” Niu Le begged as Guan Yu pushed 5 million chips forward blindly.

“Relax. Luck’s my lady tonight.”

Sun smirked, flipping his quad As. “No luck beats this.”

Guan Yu finally revealed his hole card – the last Two. “Full house – Three of a Kind with a Pair. Beats your two pairs.”

The room gasped. Niu Le’s jaw dropped. Against all odds, the rookie’s gamble paid off.
