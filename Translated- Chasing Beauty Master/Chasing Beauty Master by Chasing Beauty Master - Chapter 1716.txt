Though she couldn’t compare to Siqi’s exquisite beauty, the girl’s fair skin, panicked expression, and soul-stirring eyes ignited a different kind of desire in Ling Su.

“Oh, you see,” Ling Su immediately transformed into a refined gentleman—his handsome features impeccable, though his dark soul remained loathsome— “I found myself stranded alone in the desert and stumbled upon this place. Forgive my intrusion, but might I beg a drink of water?”

Faced with such a young, pretty maiden, Ling Su naturally adopted this genteel facade to charm her. If possible, he longed to tear off her flimsy garments right then. The girl wore only a thin robe, loosely wrapped and clutched at her chest. A single misstep would send it sliding to the ground.

Hearing his plea, the girl relaxed slightly. Moments before his arrival, she had been entangled with another man—the son of their clan’s chief, Mazhagen (Rooted Strength), a man coveted by every woman in their Ha Clan. As the tribe’s strongest warrior in this strength-revering society, he epitomized their ideals.

Here, every maiden dreamed of wedding the mightiest man to secure protection and status. Yet Mazhagen, already married to the clan’s fairest woman with a young daughter, had grown bored of domesticity. His philandering ways inevitably led to today’s tryst—interrupted by Ling Su’s untimely arrival.

The Ha Clan occupied this remote desert settlement, far from the martial world’s chaos. Clan rules strictly enforced monogamy, unlike the polygamous norms of jianghu, aligning instead with Central Plains traditions. Defiant, Mazhagen pursued affairs until his furious wife provoked him into divorcing her. As the chief’s son, none dared challenge his subsequent debauchery. Many hopeful maidens still vied for his favor, though he exploited their admiration for fleeting dalliances without commitment.

The girl before Ling Su—Xiaomei (Enchanting Charm)—had arrived half a year prior, a desert castaway taken in by the chief. Initially demure, her mesmerizing eyes gradually ensnared Mazhagen. Residing in the chief’s household, she became easy prey when the chief traveled. Today, under the pretense of fetching water, Mazhagen had lured her to his yurt.

“Please wait a moment,” Xiaomei said, avoiding Ling Su’s lingering gaze. She fetched water in a coconut-like vessel, her robe slipping dangerously as she handed it over.

“My gratitude.” Ling Su’s fingers brushed hers as he accepted the bowl, his hungry eyes devouring her form. Gulping the water, he theatrically pressed a hand to his brow. “You’ve saved my life! How can I ever repay you?”

**Chapter 4489: Beyond Restraint**

Xiaomei smiled faintly. “No repayment needed for mere water. But our clan shuns outsiders. The chief’s absence makes this no place for guests. Please depart once refreshed.”

Ling Su feigned sudden agony. “Your water—is it poisoned? My head throbs!”

“Impossible!” she protested. “I drink this daily. Perhaps exhaustion?”

Seizing the act, Ling Su swayed toward her. “Days wandering the desert... the fatigue...” He collapsed—or aimed to collapse—into her arms.

Xiaomei sidestepped, sending him sprawling. In her startled motion, the robe slid away completely. Ling Su’s eyes bulged as she scrambled to recover it.

Beyond restraint, he pounced, pinning her. “Bitch! My favor’s your fortune!” he snarled as she slapped him.

“Root Brother! Help!” she screamed.

Mazhagen erupted from the yurt, hurling Ling Su aside. Once capable of tossing men like ragdolls, the chief’s son had grown soft from months neglecting training for Xiaomei’s company. With the annual Strongman Contest approaching, his fading prowess worried none more than himself.

**Chapter 4490: Pleading Mercy**

Xiaomei, adopted as the chief’s goddaughter, addressed Mazhagen as brother—a ruse masking their illicit bond. Though notorious for wandering affections, Mazhagen’s current obsession with Xiaomei surpassed all prior flings.

Ling Su groveled before the hulking warrior. “Spare me! Desert madness clouded my judgment!”

When Mazhagen raised a fist, Ling Su produced a stolen silver stash. “Take this! Just water and safe passage!”

The bribe stayed Mazhagen’s hand. “Why come here?” he demanded, eyeing the coins.

“Lost... desperate...” Ling Su whimpered.

Xiaomei remained wary, but Mazhagen’s mercenary nature softened. Silver meant trade goods from the Central Plains. Yet lingering resentment tightened his voice: “You dare touch what’s mine?”

Ling Su kowtowed. “A moment’s weakness! Your sister’s beauty... I beg forgiveness!”

Mazhagen glowered, torn between violence and greed. Xiaomei’s narrowed eyes saw through the act, but silver’s gleam proved irresistible. The desert sun beat down on this tableau of lust, power, and survival.
