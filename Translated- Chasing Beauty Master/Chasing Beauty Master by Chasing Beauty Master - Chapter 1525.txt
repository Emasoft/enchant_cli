“Regarding Elder Xiang’s character, Elder Zheng held little esteem. Yet after decades as sect brothers, all knew each other’s true natures. Elder Xiang had always been one to seek shortcuts.”

Guan Yu declared, “If Xiao Zhi’s Blood Toxin isn’t fully purged, I’ll confront Elder Xiang and make him pay dearly.”

Though Elder Zheng preferred harmony above all, this matter involved gambling with Xiao Zhi’s life. Forcing Blood Toxin removal through spiritual energy was perilous—a misstep could prove fatal. That Elder Xiang treated it so lightly shocked him.

“I’ll visit Sect Leader tomorrow,” Elder Zheng said. “Once I borrow the spirit beast scales for testing… Surely Elder Xiang wouldn’t be so reckless with such grave matters?”

Yet even as he spoke, doubt gnawed at him.

“Guan Yu,” Elder Zheng ventured, “suppose Elder Xiang did cut corners and Xiao Zhi’s toxin remains… Could my spiritual energy compensate?”

“Impossible.” Guan Yu’s reply brooked no argument. “Blood Toxin clings tenaciously. A century’s spiritual cultivation is required—from one individual. Each person’s energy differs. Two contributors already strain the limit. More would endanger Xiao Zhi further.”

“If Elder Xiang failed, only he can complete the purification. I meant to oversee it myself, but urgent matters detained me. However, Elder Lu guarded the process throughout. His presence assures me.”

Wang Jun interjected, “Detecting residual toxin requires no spirit beast scales. Simply channel Cloud Azure Sect’s energy to attack Xiao Zhi’s mind. If Blood Toxin remains, it will manifest under duress. Let him recover first—his body’s too weakened now.”

“Brilliant!” Guan Yu approved. “Same principle as the scales. You’ve outdone yourself.”

As Wang Jun nodded, Elder Zheng instructed, “Aze, escort them. I’ll attend other matters.”

In Xiao Zhi’s chamber, the recovering youth brightened at Guan Yu’s arrival. “You came! When do we depart for the desert and Miao City?”

“Patience,” Guan Yu chuckled. “Regain your strength first. How fare you now?”

“Much improved! This morning I felt hollowed out, but spiritual energy courses through me. After eating, vitality returned.”

Relieved, Guan Yu took this as proof of Elder Xiang’s success.

Elsewhere, Elder Wang presented his newly crafted crossbow to Sect Leader Xuanming at Tiger Head Peak’s grand hall.

“The first prototype!” Xuanming eagerly examined the weapon. “Have you tested its potency?”

“Extensively. Matches expectations, though refinements remain. Effective within thirty meters—pierces armor. Future iterations will improve.”

During field testing, the crossbow shattered a distant vase effortlessly. Xuanming marveled, “Marvelous! If every disciple bore such weapons, Cloud Azure Sect would reign supreme!”

Elder Wang remained silent, privately marveling how Guan Yu’s design surpassed his lifetime of inventions.

“Improved materials enhance power,” he explained. “The frame and beast-tendon spring determine force. Miniaturization could increase range without sacrificing impact.”

When Xuanming questioned smaller bolts’ efficacy, Elder Wang assured, “Superior materials compensate. Our current stock suffices for ten more units before replenishment.”

Xuanming frowned. “Cloud Azure lacks crafting materials. Funds we have—can common wrought iron suffice?”

“Useless,” Elder Wang dismissed. “Such metal would barely reach targets, let alone shatter them.”

Though sect vaults held rare materials, Xuanming lacked access. Resolving to consult Elder Lu on procurement, he dismissed Elder Wang—unaware Guan Yu’s personal crossbow held greater power still.

Days later, with Xiao Zhi cleared for travel, Guan Yu received new orders. At Tiger Head Peak, Xuanming instructed: “Escort Prince Zou from Liaozhou to the capital. My old friend faces dangers—guard him covertly. Disclose no sect affiliations.”

Chapter 3956: Protecting a Man

Guan Yu questioned, “Why aid imperial matters? Sect and court seldom mix.”

“The threat comes from Jianghu factions. While we maintain order, so does the crown. This personal favor cannot be refused.”

Reviewing the missive later, Wang Jun frowned. “A royal convoy needing our protection? Unusual.”

“We’ll infiltrate their retinue,” Guan Yu decided. “Royal processions attract crowds—blending in should prove simple.”

When Xiao Zhi bounded in, transformed by fifty-year spiritual infusions from Elders Lu and Xiang, his vigor contrasted sharply with past frailty. Once 190 pounds, he’d shed thirty-five through ordeal-induced stress.

“Ready for adventure!” Xiao Zhi grinned. “Months confined nearly drove me mad!”

Wang Jun chuckled, “You’ve trimmed down—almost handsome now!”

As they prepared to depart, none guessed this royal escort would entangle them in schemes spanning court intrigues and ancient desert secrets—where Cloud Azure’s name might prove both shield and shackle.
