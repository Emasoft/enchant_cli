**Chapter 1158: The Four Foundational Trials (Part 2)**

With a fierce glare, his killing intent surged. Guan Yu unleashed his fist technique once more, the murderous aura around him coalescing as his punches flowed—condensing, advancing. A white tiger materialized slowly in the air.

“Roar…”

With the final strike, the white tiger’s furious roar shook heaven and earth. As the punch landed, the spectral tiger lunged forward with devastating force. A thunderous boom echoed. Though the surrounding arrays absorbed the impact, the sheer power left even Guan Yu awestruck. *Was this the true essence of fist arts?*

Closing his eyes to calm his raging blood, Guan Yu approached the stone wall etched with fist techniques and knocked three times. The azure bricks glowed as a figure materialized from the shifting array—a lifeless yet humanoid form.

“Confirm initiation of trial?” The mechanical voice held no emotion, its face rigid yet unmistakably humanoid.

“This is the Fumo Sect’s trial puppet,” interjected Jin Gang, uncharacteristically solemn. “Though soulless, its mastery of this fist art replicates the prowess of a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. Be cautious, Master.”

“Roar…”

“Roar…”

The moment Guan Yu confirmed the trial, the puppet struck. Matching his Golden Core initial-stage cultivation, Guan Yu countered. Two spectral tigers clashed midair, their roars reverberating as the fighters exchanged blows on the ground. Though both wielded the same Thirty-Six Heavenly Stars Subduing Tiger Fist, Guan Yu found himself overpowered—not due to realm disparity, but sheer combat experience. The puppet’s precision, its split-second adaptations, rendered it a terrifying opponent.

*Crack!*

Their figures collided and staggered back. Guan Yu halted after half a step, his eyes glinting with murderous resolve. Blood trickled from his lips, his organs aching, yet he ignored the pain.

“Kill!”

*Boom!*

The white tiger phantom pounced, obliterating the puppet in an explosion of dispersed spiritual energy.

“Disciple time: three and a half minutes. Moves used: thirty-nine. Evaluation: Grade A+. Outstanding comprehension, superior temperament. Rewards: three drops of Soul-Condensing Dew, three Marrow-Cleansing Pills, three Tendon-Transforming Pills, one Golden Core realm cultivation manual from the Legacy Pavilion.”

As the mechanical voice announced the results, the stone wall dissolved into azure mist that surged into Guan Yu’s body.

“Hiss…”

He inhaled deeply, euphoria washing over him as if every organ bathed in warm nourishment. Though the sensation lasted mere seconds, his injuries vanished entirely, leaving him rejuvenated.

“Fucking incredible. Even drugs can’t compare to this,” Guan Yu muttered, marveling at his restored state. “No wonder ancient cultivators pursued this path so fervently.”

Next, he reluctantly chose swordsmanship—a discipline he’d neglected despite knowing techniques from White Cloud Temple. The sect’s water-softened styles had never resonated with him. But the Fumo Sect’s legacy proved different.

“The sword: a blade of the heart. It may kill or protect. Thus, the Sword Sect declares: the sword’s heart reflects the wielder’s…”

The introductory text awed Guan Yu. This ancient sect’s wisdom dwarfed modern cultivation’s decayed remnants.

“Sword Art: Big Dipper Seven Stars. Golden Core realm technique. Channel starlight into sword qi…”

Superior to the fist art, this method took Guan Yu half an hour to memorize fully. A gleaming three-foot sword materialized—untarnished by time, its edge lethally sharp.

Six hours of study yielded basic proficiency, yet true sword intent eluded him. In the trial, he suffered 307 wounds, his body bloodied and pale, before conceding defeat.

“Challenger defeated. Time: half an hour. Moves used: 310. Evaluation: Grade B. Rewards: one Blood Origin Pill, two bottles of Fasting Pills, one superior-grade spirit sword, one ritual robe.”

Azure light healed his wounds, leaving skin flawless—a testament to immortal methods. Yet weakness lingered from blood loss.

**Chapter 1159: The Four Foundational Trials (Part 3)**

“Why do I feel hollow despite healing?” Guan Yu lay exhausted.

“The trial realm mends wounds but can’t replenish lost blood essence. Consume the Blood Origin Pill,” Jin Gang advised.

The pill’s fiery purification excruciatingly cleansed his bloodstream, leaving a black scab of impurities. Subsequent Fasting Pills banished hunger, their energy nourishing him for days.

Next, movement techniques: Thunder Step, a precursor to Nascent Soul lightning teleportation. Guan Yu’s desperate evasion under a barrage of violet blades culminated in a perilous epiphany—his first successful Lightning Dash, albeit with bleeding orifices.

“Trial passed. Initial Lightning Dash comprehended. Evaluation: Grade B-. Rewards: one Blood Origin Pill, one bottle of Soul-Condensing Pills.”

The staff trial proved harder, barely earning a pass with Grade C.

**Chapter 1160: Encountering the Demonic Sect Again**

“Four trials completed. Excellence in swordsmanship and lightning affinity. Recommendation: pursue sword path with thunder辅助. Reward: Minor Cosmos Ring. Depart now?”

Relieved, Guan Yu emerged onto a sunlit grassland. Before he could approach the legacy stele, a figure stumbled into view—Ye Qingling, pursued by three figures.

“Eldest Senior Brother betrayed us! Demonic sect ambush… rescue them west five li!” Collapsing in Guan Yu’s arms, she fell unconscious.

“Well met, Guan Yu.” The chilling voice belonged to Ren Qiansha—Demonic Sect’s leader, flanked by Xiang Tiansheng and Qing Fu.
