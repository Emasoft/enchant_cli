“It would be no exaggeration to say this place was teeming with people. With such crowds naturally came chaos, making accidents highly likely. Hence, numerous治安警察 (public security officers) normally patrolled here.

Guanyu had never liked coming here before, considering it merely a place where street vendors sold slightly cheaper goods of questionable quality, where one could easily be swindled. That’s why he generally avoided such markets.

Today, he’d made an exception to bring Shuangshuang here for some fun.

At that moment, a young couple was arguing nearby. Though their exact words were unclear, their heated exchange marked them as lovers quarreling. The man strode ahead, shouting over his shoulder while the girl chased after him, both voices rising in mutual recrimination.

Though their commotion drew some onlookers, most passersby seemed accustomed to such scenes and paid no heed.

Shuangshuang deliberately glanced at the approaching young man before whispering to Xue Jing, “Sister Jing, are those two going to fight? They look furious.”

Xue Jing smiled reassuringly. “Probably just a lovers’ spat. They’ll calm down soon.” Shuangshuang nodded but kept stealing glances.

The man stormed toward Guanyu’s direction, his face flushed with anger. “Stop following me!” he panted. “From now on, we’re through! Don’t expect me to forgive you!”

The girl persisted, “Why are you being so petty? I told you it was a misunderstanding! You take my money for cigarettes, alcohol, internet cafes—and now you want to dump me? What am I to you?”

“I don’t want to be with you anymore!” The faster the girl pursued, the quicker the man fled. Guanyu now grasped the situation—a classic young couple’s breakup drama.

Judging by their student-like appearances, Guanyu found their quarrel amusing. Xue Jing led Shuangshuang ahead while Guanyu trailed behind, letting them explore freely. As the arguing pair neared Xue Jing’s group, Shuangshuang stared openly. “Sister Jing, that boy’s so angry he’s sweating on his forehead!”

Xue Jing had been examining a vendor’s trinkets, initially ignoring the commotion. But at Shuangshuang’s words, her expression transformed to horror. Whirling around, she screamed, “Guanyu, watch out!”

The young man now brushed past Guanyu, who’d been idly observing the lovers’ quarrel. Without warning, the youth produced a 20-centimeter dagger gleaming coldly—and thrust it toward Guanyu’s abdomen!

Xue Jing glimpsed this mid-turn. Acting instinctively, she kicked at the assailant’s wrist from several paces away. But the attacker was already too close. Guanyu, initially bemused, realized the danger too late. He twisted sideways to avoid vital organs.

His reflexes dulled compared to his prime—once, he’d have summoned a protective shield instantly. Now, with the blade inches away, he could only shift slightly before retaliating with a crushing right hook, prepared to trade wound for wound.

At the critical moment, Xue Jing’s kick struck true, dislodging the dagger mere centimeters from piercing Guanyu’s clothes. Simultaneously, Guanyu’s fist smashed into the attacker’s face, sending him reeling into a vendor’s stall. His skull cracked against pavement tiles as he collapsed, dazed or unconscious.

Before Xue Jing could retract her leg, Shuangshuang screamed, “Sister Jing, behind you!” The pursuing girl—now revealed as an accomplice—lunged with her own dagger toward Xue Jing’s kidney!

In the chaos, Xue Jing focused on Guanyu while Shuangshuang desperately clung to her arm, shielding Xue Jing with her own body.

*Thunk!*

The blade sank into Shuangshuang’s lower back. She gasped softly, pain contorting her features. When the assailant yanked the bloody dagger free, Shuangshuang’s scream pierced the air.

As the girl raised the weapon again, Xue Jing spun around, catching Shuangshuang’s slumping form.

**Chapter 2616: Assassination (Part 2)**

Seeing Shuangshuang’s pallor, Xue Jing erupted with glacial energy. A biting cold radiated from her, repelling even Guanyu several steps back. Within two meters, frost scattered bystanders and vendor carts alike.

Her hair streaming like frozen banners, Xue Jing snatched the dagger mid-swing and slashed—a crimson line bloomed across the female assassin’s throat. Gurgling blood bubbles, the girl collapsed under the icy gale.

Chaos erupted as bystanders shrieked, “Murder! Run!” The crowd surged outward while curious onlookers pressed inward, creating dangerous congestion.

“Shuangshuang! Stay awake!” Xue Jing wept, pressing hands over the gushing wound. Guanyu stripped his shirt to bind the girl’s waist, slowing blood loss.

Shuangshuang’s eyelids fluttered. “Big Brother… it hurts… so cold…”

Xue Jing channeled frigid spiritual energy into the wound—counterproductive for hypovolemic shock but the only means to staunch bleeding. “Keep your eyes open! We’ll take you everywhere, just stay awake!”

Guanyu dialed for an ambulance, noting the military-style dagger’s cruel design—serrated back and blood grooves explaining the rapid hemorrhage.

As Shuangshuang murmured, “Big Brother… will you… still take me out…?” Guanyu fought tears. “Every day. We’ll travel the whole country.”

**Chapter 2617: Assassination (Finale)**

Xue Jing’s face whitened from energy expenditure, but the bleeding slowed. She cradled Shuangshuang, ignoring numb legs and icy pavement.

When治安警察 (security police) finally pushed through the crowd, their batons and bluster met Guanyu’s fury. A fat officer prodded him—until Guanyu pressed a Desert Eagle to his forehead.

“Interrupt us again,” Guanyu growled, “and I paint the street with your brains.”

The cop collapsed trembling as Guanyu returned to whisper comforts, his bloodied hand clasping Shuangshuang’s. The girl managed a ghost of a smile. “Big Brother… so obedient… I’ll stay awake…”

Only when ambulance sirens wailed did hope flicker—if they could stabilize her now, transfusion and surgery might save her. But as Xue Jing’s energy waned and Shuangshuang’s breaths shallowed, the waiting stretched like eternity.
