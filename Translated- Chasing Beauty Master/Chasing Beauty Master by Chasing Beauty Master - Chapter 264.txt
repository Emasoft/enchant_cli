“Then you haven’t repaid the favor?” Guan Yu asked.

“Tsk, no one said you have to die to repay a debt.” Lin Dong curled his lip mockingly.

Guan Yu was speechless. He’d seen it all now—Lin Dong was shamelessly耍无赖, yet it oddly appealed to him.

After a long pause, Guan Yu ventured, “Can I ask the name of the mercenary group you were part of before?”

“Wolf Fang.” Lin Dong uttered the two words calmly, yet an undercurrent of murderous intent chilled the air to the bone.

“Is the organization still around?” Guan Yu pressed.

“Oh, very much so.” Lin Dong sneered. “They’re thriving more than ever now that they’ve abandoned their principles. They’re no longer the disciplined soldiers of the past. Wherever there’s profit, you’ll find them.”

“Did you come to me for revenge?” Guan Yu asked cautiously.

“Not entirely.” Lin Dong didn’t deny his purpose in aiding Guan Yu. “I see potential in you, but what I value more is your character. If you were like Wan Qianshan or Zhou Jin, you’d be dead already.”

“You really don’t hold back, do you?” Guan Yu scowled, incensed at being compared to Zhou Jin, the scum behind the “four fields and forty oxen” scandal.

“Ha! Honesty’s the best policy.” Lin Dong grinned.

“Are they easy to deal with?” Guan Yu asked.

“What do you think?” Lin Dong gave him a look reserved for idiots.

**Chapter 669: Dust Settles**

“How dangerous are they?” Guan Yu gritted his teeth.

“Wolf Fang maintains seven members at all times—replacements are chosen through brutal selection when others die or are crippled. Each is formidable, especially their leader.”

“How formidable?” Guan Yu interrupted.

Lin Dong glanced at him. “At least three of you might stand a chance.”

“Bullshit.” Guan Yu rolled his eyes. His current strength was nothing to scoff at—he’d nearly秒杀ed Huang Ming!

“Test it yourself.” Lin Dong shrugged.

“Bring it on! I’ve had enough of your crap. Just because the tiger doesn’t roar, you think I’m a three-legged cat?” Guan Yu leapt up, rolling his sleeves.

“Oh? Had enough? Let’s vent that frustration.” Lin Dong rose lazily, disdain etched on his face.

Guan Yu roared, launching a full-force punch.

Much later…

Gasping for breath, Guan Yu slumped against the couch, massaging his face and stomach while glaring at Lin Dong, who stood unfazed. “They say don’t hit the face! Why aim there?”

Lin Dong smirked. “Wasn’t just your face—you’re rubbing your stomach too.”

“I…” Guan Yu choked. Only after vehement protests had Lin Dong “mercifully” switched to kicking his gut—a strike so brutal it nearly brought tears.

“Damn it! I’ll get you back for this!” Guan Yu plopped down, sulking as he lit a cigarette.

Lin Dong chuckled approvingly. “You’ve improved remarkably in such short time. Shocking, really. Still a hair’s breadth from true mastery, though.”

Guan Yu detected no praise in this. He recalled their previous clash in the capital, realizing Lin Dong had been toying with him all along. Today’s all-out assault had yielded nothing—proof of the gap between them. The humiliation burned.

“Stop moping. See the difference now? Three of you might barely match him.” Lin Dong drove the knife deeper.

Guan Yu’s heart clenched. Even this vague sense of the Wolf Fang leader’s power filled him with dread.

“How many of you would it take to beat him?” he joked weakly.

“One and a half.” Lin Dong paused. “With guns.”

Guan Yu’s eye twitched. Having witnessed Lin Dong’s枪法—effortlessly taking on crowds—the math was terrifying. What kind of monster led Wolf Fang?

“Scared?” Lin Dong grinned. “I can back out.”

“I’m no coward! Seven mercenaries against two cities and an island? Plus future expansions!” Guan Yu’s bravado surged, fueled by faith in Lin Dong.

The two laughed through the night, bonding until dawn. Lin Dong departed for Yunnan to procure gu worms, while Guan Yu returned to Feng Xin’s villa with Wan Qianshan in tow.

Luo Cheng nearly had a heart attack seeing Guan Yu bloodied. “Boss! How bad is it?”

“Five bullets. Nothing serious.”

“FIVE? Go to the hospital!”

“Do I look like I’m dying?” Guan Yu scoffed. The healing system had already mended his wounds overnight—upgrades allowed near-miraculous recovery. Only fear of暴露 kept him from full regeneration.

Luo Cheng noticed the bedraggled captive. “Who’s that?”

“Wan Qianshan.”

“Wan Qianshan?!” Luo Cheng’s heart nearly failed. “It’s over?”

“Why else would I be back?”

“I thought you came to recuperate…”

Guan Yu flicked Luo Cheng’s forehead. “Keep him alive. He’s still useful.”

“But he’s a time bomb!”

“Bombs can explode on others too. Zhou Jin’s corpse is in an L市 manor—clean it up. With both leaders gone, it’s our time. Coordinate with Boss Liu and the others.”

As Luo Cheng left, Guan Yu added, “Leave Chu Hong’s territory untouched. We’re allies.”

“Chu Hong?” Luo Cheng smirked,竖起大拇指. “Boss’s charm works wonders.”

Guan Yu barely resisted kicking him.

With the crisis resolved, treatment for the elders and Feng Xin began.

**Chapter 670: Guan Yu Ascendant, Four Pillars**

Feng Xin’s grandfather awoke first, wheelchair-bound but radiantly healthy—thanks to the healing system’s full power and newly enhanced diagnostic feedback prescribing precise herbal regimens.

“Thanks to you, this old bone avoids the grave,” the elder boomed as Guan Yu wheeled him out. “I want great-grandchildren before I go!”

“Xin’er’s condition?” he asked soberly.

“Improving daily. I’ll restore her completely,” Guan Yu vowed.

The elder grew solemn. “When she recovers, I want you to take over the family business. Xin’s suffered enough.”

Guan Yu declined until the elder insisted: “Her safety matters more. Promise me she’ll have peace.”

After negotiations, Guan Yu agreed to steward the empire until Feng Xin married—a compromise the elder exploited: “Better yet, marry her! Bring your father for New Year’s!”

Guan Yu fled upstairs.

Consulting other recovering elders, Guan Yu proposed consolidating N市’s underworld into four allied factions. Despite challenges, his commanding presence won agreement.

Five days later, N市’s underworld restructured under four pillars—with Guan Yu’s merged forces (Feng’s legacy, Chu Hong’s faction, and his own) reigning supreme.

**Chapter 671: Disfigured?**

Lin Dong returned with Yunnan’s “specialty”—Bloodthirsty Bugs. Microscopic gu worms appearing as red specks when clustered, they lurked in hosts for decades, harmless until activated to ravage organs gruesomely.

“Don’t let them escape,” Lin Dong warned, handing over the vial.

“Just one?” Guan Yu squinted.

“One? Look closer.”

The crimson swarm writhed—a hundred nightmares in a thimble.
