Luo Bo waved toward the Golden Cup van as he spoke. Only then did the three men inside realize they'd been fooled—this was the Ma Family Casino all along. The bastard had driven them around the city in circles before returning to the exact same spot, loudly announcing his presence in the same manner.

After getting back into his SUV and driving off, the three dejected men emerged from their van like mourners at a funeral, abandoning further pursuit. They understood now—Luo Bo had spotted them from the start, toying with them the entire time. There was no point continuing; they'd only be led on another pointless loop.

The trio returned to the casino to report to Ju Niu. "How did the investigation go? Did you see where he went?" Ju Niu demanded.

The men hesitated until one finally spoke: "We saw everything clearly. We followed him the whole time, but..."

"But what? Stop fucking stammering and spit it out!" Ju Niu barked.

The subordinate hurriedly continued: "First he went to Qiaoyuan Street. We overheard him tell the bodyguards at the gate, 'Guan Yu isn't home? I'll come back later.'"

"Goddamn Guan Yu!" Ju Niu slammed his fist. "I knew he was behind this! We must inform the boss immediately."

"Then he drove to the Feng Family estate," the man added. "We only caught him saying, 'Since Young Master Bill isn't home, I'll return tomorrow.'"

Ju Niu frowned. "He visited both Qiaoyuan District and the Fengs? And used the same excuses? Whose side is he on?"

"Absolutely certain," the subordinate insisted. "We tailed him closely. He visited numerous locations before circling back to our casino. He told the doorman, 'Since Boss Ma isn't in, I'll return tomorrow.' That's when we realized we'd been played..."

Ju Niu, mid-sip from his teacup, sprayed water across his subordinate's face. "Fuck you all! I'm raising a bunch of useless trash! Get out!" He booted the men out, his rage boiling as he decided against reporting this humiliation to Ma Tong.

Fang Su rushed home after receiving an urgent call—his aunt had arrived. Sent by the Fang Family to assist against Guan Yu, this aunt was no ordinary woman. Known in the martial world as Poison Widow, one of the Ten Great Evils, her reputation preceded her.

For Fang Su, who'd been clinging to Bill Lin for protection, her arrival meant newfound security. Poison Widow's origins were legendary:

Once a village girl named Zi Li, she'd defied her family to marry a blind man. When she discovered his affair with a neighbor during her pregnancy, madness consumed her. She slaughtered both lovers with a cleaver, then turned the blade on her own womb.

Rescued and hospitalized, she vanished during recovery, reappearing years later as Poison Widow—a merciless killer of unfaithful men. Now semi-reformed yet still fearsome, she'd agreed to aid her sister's family against their nemesis.

Fang Su presented his aunt with an opulent gold wristwatch studded with diamonds. "A small token for your arrival," he said unctuously.

Poison Widow's weather-beaten hands contrasted sharply with the glittering accessory. "Such thoughtfulness!" she crooned, admiring the gift. "Your nephew has excellent taste."

As Fang Su fastened the clasp, his father interjected: "We need your help against Guan Yu. This... student has been undermining our operations."

Poison Widow's laughter died. "A schoolboy troubles you? Pathetic." She fixed her brother-in-law with a withering stare. "You've grown soft,姐夫. But fear not—I'll pluck this weed from your garden."

Flushed with pride at his aunt's approval, Fang Su failed to notice her disdain. Poison Widow examined her new watch, its brilliance mocking the Fangs' desperation. The real game, she knew, had only just begun.
