She stared at Guan Yu, taking a deep breath as she slowly raised her arm to her bare shoulder. With a gentle tug, the spaghetti strap slipped loose. Articulating each word deliberately, she asked, “Is this... enough?”

**Chapter 640: Stakeout**

“Locate the arsenal?” Chu Hong frowned slightly.

Guan Yu nodded. “Xiao Xiong has suffered significant losses because of these weapons. I want to uproot their entire operation by finding where they’re stockpiled. Without that firepower, Cheng Gui will no longer be a match for Xiao Xiong.”

“You plan to seize the arsenal?” Chu Hong pressed.

Guan Yu shook his head. “As a model citizen, my duty is to report criminal activities and uphold social harmony.”

Chu Hong rolled her eyes. *So he’s just using the police as pawns while pretending to be noble.*

After a pause, she narrowed her eyes. “You’re scheming to eliminate Cheng Gui by proxy?”

“Let’s not phrase it that way. Fighting crime is the duty of public servants. A humble citizen like me only needs to provide tips and collect a modest reward.”

Though Guan Yu denied it, Chu Hong saw through his façade. The man was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, clearly intending to pit the police against Cheng Gui. Given Cheng Gui’s access to advanced weaponry, a direct assault would be risky and costly. By outsourcing the heavy lifting to the authorities, Guan Yu could pursue his own hidden agenda.

“Since we’re collaborating, Cheng Gui must be our first target. Removing him will strengthen Xiao Xiong’s position, making it easier to deal with Wan Qianshan afterward,” Guan Yu asserted solemnly.

After a moment’s thought, Chu Hong replied, “Give me a week. I’ll extract the intel you need.”

Guan Yu leaned back in his chair, smirking. “Use whatever methods you like—just don’t involve your body again. My women are mine alone to tease. No one else... touches them.”

With their partnership formalized, Chu Hong’s earlier proposition now fell under Guan Yu’s scrutiny. While her beauty rivaled the women around him, she couldn’t compare to Wenqing and others bound to him by genuine affection. Whether sparks would fly between them in the future remained uncertain.

Chu Hong’s cheeks flushed faintly as she shot him a coquettish glance. “My skills extend beyond my physique. Otherwise, I’d never have thrived in N City.”

“Then I’ll await good news.” Guan Yu grinned before suddenly eyeing her meaningfully. “Cheng Gui likely saw us leave together. Shouldn’t we stage something to avoid suspicion?”

“Unnecessary. A man’s... stamina isn’t always enduring.” With that retort, she swayed out of the room, leaving Guan Yu scowling.

*Not enduring? You’ll learn otherwise soon enough.*

He flopped onto the bed, muttering resentfully before closing his eyes.

Over the following week, clashes between Cheng Gui and Xiao Xiong’s factions erupted over ten times. Despite minor victories, Xiao Xiong’s side suffered heavy losses. Meanwhile, Hanhai intensified its financial assault on Mo Kai, battering his company’s stocks. The situation grew increasingly dire for Xiao Xiong.

Guan Yu worked closely with him to strategize against Cheng Gui’s relentless onslaught. On the sixth day after his secret meeting with Chu Hong, Guan Yu received an anonymous text.

He was discussing fundraising strategies with Xiao Xiong when the message arrived. A sly smile spread across his face.

Noticing his distraction, Xiao Xiong asked, “What is it?”

“Brother Xiao... It’s time to counterattack.”

“Hm?”

“Intel says Cheng Gui demanded another massive arms shipment from Wan Qianshan to finish us off. A private yacht will deliver it to Minggang Port tomorrow night.”

Xiao Xiong’s eyes lit up before dimming with caution. “Reliable source?”

“Absolutely.” Guan Yu’s confidence left no room for doubt. He kept Chu Hong’s involvement hidden per her request.

“Then we’ll play model citizens once more!” Xiao Xiong laughed, refusing to probe further. Trusting Guan Yu was enough.

“Great minds think alike.” Guan Yu grinned, giving a thumbs-up.

“We’re giving Chief Jia a grand gift. He’ll owe us a feast after this!”

As they celebrated, the two began plotting their moves. While the police would take center stage, their own preparations were crucial.

**Chapter 641: Firefight!**

Mo Ling’s mood had soured a week earlier at the banquet, watching Guan Yu leave with a stunning woman. The implication of their departure gnawed at her, leaving her inexplicably irritable.

Her cousin Mo Xun, son of L City’s mayor, took her yachting to lift her spirits. Aboard the *Sea Breeze*—owned by Hanhai’s second-in-command Chen Laida—six young elites played Three Kingdoms Kill while Chen rested elsewhere.

At thirty, Chen Laida had risen to power through ruthlessness mirroring Cheng Gui’s. Tonight’s arms transfer hid behind this pleasure cruise, with the guests serving as both camouflage and potential hostages.

As the yacht docked at Minggang Port, a police megaphone blared: “Heave to for inspection!”

Chen’s face twisted. “Arm up! Full speed ahead—ram through!”

Gunfire erupted. SWAT boats swarmed as helicopters thundered overhead. When rockets streaked toward the aircraft, Chief Jia cursed: “They’ve got a mobile armory!”

**Chapter 642: Hostages**

Inside, Chen Laida aimed his rifle at the six trembling socialites. “Smile for the cameras,” he sneered, snapping photos. “Let your parents see how the police doomed you.”

Mo Ling trembled, recalling how Guan Yu had saved her last time. Now, facing death alone, she realized how deeply she’d come to rely on him.

As gunfire raged outside, Chen barked: “Tell daddy’s cops to back off—or I start returning you piece by piece!”

The hostages forced ghastly smiles, their futures hanging by a thread.
