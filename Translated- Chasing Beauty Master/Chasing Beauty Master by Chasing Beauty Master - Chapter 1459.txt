The room where Xiao Zhi was detained had been sealed with restrictive spells, preventing anyone from casting magic unless their power surpassed that of the caster who laid the seals. Without breaking through this magical barrier, not even a wisp of spiritual energy could be summoned here.

**Chapter 3802: Framed**

Xiao Zhi said, “This object is a communication artifact. Channel your spiritual energy into it, and the recipient will sense your call. You can then converse. The matching artifact is with my father, Chief Zheng. When you have time, find a secluded spot and contact him. Urge him to warn Guan Yu—he must not return to the sect.”

“Chief Zheng is like a clay idol fording a river—barely able to save himself. How could he spare any effort for Guan Yu? You’re overestimating him. And why haven’t you told Chief Lu about this?” Wang Jun retorted.

“It’s different. Even if my father’s diminished, a starved camel is still larger than a horse. Sending a few men to relay a message to Guan Yu is well within his capabilities. Besides, given my current predicament, Guan Yu has likely already heard of my arrest. He’ll trust my father’s word but might doubt Chief Lu’s.”

Wang Jun nodded. “You’re right. I’ll help, but I can’t guarantee the outcome. I’m surprised you still care for others in your dire state. Guan Yu didn’t befriend you in vain.”

“Of course. Guan Yu and I have weathered life-and-death trials—our bond is extraordinary. But this time, he’s been ensnared in a plot. If he returns, his fate will be worse than mine. We must stop him at all costs.”

Though Wang Jun had little personal stake in Guan Yu’s affairs, he now felt compelled to intervene. As Xiao Zhi had said, Guan Yu’s return would spell disaster.

Another worry gnawed at Wang Jun: Chief Lu’s recent mention of rooting out spies.

Over the past days, the sect’s chiefs had been auditing their disciples’ rosters. Wang Jun knew the purge was imminent. He agonized over how to evade detection. If unsuccessful, he’d have to flee before the spiritual beast scales revealed the blood toxin in his veins—a discovery that would doom him.

Knowing Xiao Zhi had been framed, Wang Jun asked, “Setting aside your ties to Guan Yu, I’ll help—but first, answer me truthfully.”

“Ask anything. I’ve nothing left to hide,” Xiao Zhi replied, desperate for conversation.

“Who framed you? Or tell me this—how did the blood toxin enter your body?”

Xiao Zhi blinked. “Blood toxin? What’s that? I don’t have it.”

Wang Jun smiled mockingly, pitying the man who’d been reduced to a monster yet remained ignorant of his own affliction. “This confirms you were framed.” He glanced around before whispering, “You’re infected with blood toxin. Your transformation outside Tigerhead Peak was its eruption. Understand now?”

Xiao Zhi’s eyes widened. “You seem knowledgeable. Tell me—how does one contract this toxin? I’ve no recollection.”

“So you have no suspects? Truly pitiable.”

“I have suspicions… but lack proof.”

“Did you notice any bodily anomalies beforehand?”

“None. The Tigerhead Peak incident was the first. I never realized I’d been poisoned.”

Wang Jun deduced the culprit must be someone close to Xiao Zhi—only intimacy allowed such sabotage. “Who do you suspect?”

Xiao Zhi hesitated, then spat, “Yanzhao.”

Wang Jun remained impassive, though inwardly unsurprised. He’d long suspected Yanzhao of being a demonic sect puppet like himself. The revelation that even Cloud Azure Sect’s head disciple had fallen proved the cult’s insidious reach.

Xiao Zhi, misreading the silence, backtracked: “Merely a suspicion! No evidence. Forget I spoke.”

“Evidence lies in your journey,” Wang Jun pressed. “You returned with Yanzhao. Recall any wounds contacting blood? Shared meals? Visits to brothels?”

Knowing blood toxin’s transmission required deliberate action, he probed for the critical detail.

“I had internal injuries, no open wounds. Ate at taverns often,” Xiao Zhi said.

**Chapter 3803: Rambling**

“Impossible,” Wang Jun countered. “Public meals allow no tampering. Blood toxin spreads through direct blood contact or ingestion. Think—did someone add blood to your food?”

“I remember!” Xiao Zhi exclaimed.

“Quiet!” Wang Jun hissed, glancing nervously. Guards weren’t supposed to converse with prisoners—a rule he’d already broken.

Chastened, Xiao Zhi whispered, “During our return, Yanzhao brewed me medicinal soup for my injuries. I drank it without suspicion.”

“That’s your answer,” Wang Jun concluded.

“You believe him too? Will you testify?” Hope lit Xiao Zhi’s eyes.

“And implicate myself? This cesspool isn’t my fight. Without proof, accusing Yanzhao—the sect’s idol—would only bury you deeper. If exposed, he’d claim you’re accomplices.”

Xiao Zhi paled. “You… you called our leader ‘Xuanming’! How dare you use the Patriarch’s personal name?”

Wang Jun cursed his slip. No disciple dared utter the sect master’s birth name—a grave offense.

“How do you know about blood toxin?” Xiao Zhi pressed. “Such familiarity with demonic arts—”

“Enough questions!” Wang Jun snapped. “Do you want help or not?”

Subdued, Xiao Zhi muttered, “Just… please contact my father. Warn Guan Yu.”

“I care more for Guan Yu than you,” Wang Jun said, closing the cell door. “Rest.”

As the iron gate clanged shut, Wang Jun exhaled. That name slip could’ve been fatal. Now certain Yanzhao was a fellow puppet, he realized the demonic sect’s claws reached even Cloud Azure’s elite. Xiao Zhi’s trust in his senior had been his undoing.

**Chapter 3804: Discontent**

The next day, Wang Jun retrieved the black communication artifact from Xiao Zhi. Amid heightened sect security, contacting Chief Lu directly proved impossible. Channeling spiritual energy into the device, it vibrated before projecting Chief Zheng’s holographic image.

“Who are you? A Bamboo Peak disciple?” Chief Zheng demanded, hope warring with caution.

“Chief Zheng,” Wang Jun spoke swiftly, “Xiao Zhi entrusted me to relay: He’s safe under Chief Lu’s care. Urge Guan Yu not to return. Also, Xiao Zhi requests Chief Lu’s presence—he has crucial testimony about his framing.”

Overcome, Chief Zheng called his wife Luo Jie. “Our son lives! He’s…”

Wang Jun cut in: “Respectfully, time is scarce. Please spread the warning to Guan Yu.”

“It shall be done,” Chief Zheng vowed.

Terminating the connection, Wang Jun marveled at the artifact’s ingenuity despite its spiritual energy drain. “A genius invention… if only it were more efficient.”

Meanwhile, at the Demonic Soul Sect, Guan Yu paced restlessly. Trapped between danger outside and worry for Xiao Zhi, he found no peace.

“You seem troubled,” Wang Xiaorong observed during dinner. “Does our hospitality displease you?”

Guan Yu forced a smile. Staying meant stagnation; leaving risked branded betrayal. His reputation hung by a thread—a thread slowly fraying with each idle day.
