However, Aunt Qing seemed not overly bothered by the odor, perhaps having grown accustomed to serpentine scents during her recent snake-keeping. Inside the box lay an object resembling a desiccated piece of pork liver. She inquired, “Guan Yu, what is this?”

Guan Yu smiled. “This is the gallbladder from an enormous python—over twenty meters long and more than a meter thick at its midsection. I acquired it by chance during an expedition to a tropical forest. I thought Uncle Qing might appreciate it as a gift.”

Aunt Qing’s expression darkened at the mention of “Uncle Qing.” She had not intended to reveal her husband’s presence today, believing Guan Yu unaware of his whereabouts. “Did Ling’er tell you?” she asked doubtfully, knowing her daughter Qing Linger (Spirit Willow) had been strictly forbidden from disclosing her father’s location to anyone, including Guan Yu.

Guan Yu chuckled. “There’s no need for alarm, Aunt Qing. I deduced Uncle Qing’s presence here myself. His serpent-rearing activities betrayed his location.”

Aunt Qing lowered her gaze. Earlier, her delayed response to Guan Yu’s arrival had been to allow Uncle Qing and his apprentice time to escape through the rear exit. Now, the two men stood listening outside the back door, overhearing every word.

“A friend purchased a green venomous serpent here,” Guan Yu continued, noting her hesitation. “His account led me to surmise Uncle Qing’s residence. My visit bears no ulterior motive—I merely wish to pay respects.”

After a contemplative pause, Aunt Qing rose. “Given all you’ve done for Ling’er and our family, we should extend our trust.” She moved to the rear entrance and ushered in Uncle Qing and his apprentice.

Guan Yu stood to greet the pallid, frail man whose complexion bore the toll of chronic serpent venom. “Greetings, Uncle Qing.”

“Forgive the secrecy, Guan Yu,” Uncle Qing rasped. “My continued survival necessitates caution.”

Guan Yu nodded understandingly—the more who knew of the man’s whereabouts, the greater the risk of his past resurfacing, endangering his entire family. Producing the python’s gallbladder, he asked, “Might this aid your condition?”

Uncle Qing’s eyes lit with fervor as he approached. Though not a cure, the massive gallbladder could suppress his venom for months, reducing his dependence on regular serpentine extracts. “My profound gratitude! But how did you slay such a beast?”

As they settled, Guan Yu recounted his harrowing journey: Ling’er’s poisoning by her grandaunt’s toxin, his desperate forest expedition, encounters with fire-spewing wolf-beasts, volcanic thermal springs housing demonic entities, a lake-dwelling horned buffalo, and the final confrontation with the colossal python.

The listeners grew ashen, mouths agape. “By the heavens!” Uncle Qing exclaimed. “Only your prowess could have survived such perils! We’ve wronged you with our distrust.”

“Any child would protect their parent thus,” Guan Yu demurred. “Yet your concealment here grows precarious. Increased serpent sales draw attention—your anonymity cannot last.”

Uncle Qing sighed. “True. We refuse to use Ling’er’s earnings, saving for her dowry. The snake trade sustains us but risks exposure.”

Their discourse shattered as a female voice snarled outside: “The old wretch is here!” A scuffle ensued—Aunt Qing’s choked cry, the thud of Hou Jinshun’s guard being felled, then the door crashing open.

Cloaked in voluminous black robes that swallowed even her head, the intruder dragged Aunt Qing by the throat. Uncle Qing’s martial sister had arrived.

Guan Yu surged upright, aura flaring. “Release her!”

“Two lives remain here,” the sister hissed. “Choose who dies.”

Uncle Qing stepped forward, resigned. “End this feud. Take me, but spare them.”

“NO!” Aunt Qing gasped through the choking grip. “Flee!”

“Silence, harlot!” The sister tightened her hold. “Your peasant romance nauseates me still!”

Guan Yu’s taunt cut through: “Hiding beneath rags, grandmother? Does age ravage what little beauty you once claimed?”

The barb struck true—the sister’s free hand shot out, blasting Uncle Qing across the room. Blood sprayed as he crumpled. “Witness your protector’s end!” she crowed.

Through crimson flecks, Uncle Qing gasped to Guan Yu: “Swear to safeguard Ling’er... and my apprentice...”

“Enough theatrics!” The sister raised a venom-clawed hand for the coup de grâce. Guan Yu’s aura coalesced—but halted as Uncle Qing’s weakening voice carried:

“This debt... is mine alone...”
