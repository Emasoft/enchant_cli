“That’s practically impossible.” Wang Jun continued, “What you described isn’t unheard of, but it’s highly improbable. If the Zhao family’s daughter (Thousand Gold) were truly beautiful, wouldn’t suitors flock to their doorstep? Liaozhou City is vast, filled with wealthy young masters. Why would they need to hold a public contest to find a son-in-law?”

Guan Yu pondered this and found Wang Jun’s reasoning sound. Last time, when Qiaoqiao had organized her martial arts contest to choose a husband, it had also been born of desperation.

But Qiaoqiao’s delicate charm could make her a beauty anywhere, never lacking for marriage prospects. Guan Yu even recalled the girl’s obvious fondness for him, though her connection to Xue Jing had kept her from speaking openly.

Having wandered the martial world, Guan Yu had never before encountered a family hosting such a contest. Typically, these events followed strict rules, and he wondered what the Zhao family’s regulations might be. Aze suddenly materialized beside him, craning his neck to look up at Guan Yu. “Ah, Guan Yu! Being tall has its advantages—you can see everything clearly, even over crowds!”

“Watch your tongue!” Wang Jun snapped, sensitive about his own shorter stature. Though Wang Jun’s height was average for a Central Plains woman, it fell short among men. Fortunately, the row of children in front allowed everyone a clear view.

“If you can’t speak properly, keep quiet!” Wang Jun glared at Aze, misinterpreting the comment as a jab at his height.

Aze, ever the blunt speaker, retorted, “What’s your problem? I was complimenting Guan Yu’s height! Does your shortness mean others can’t be tall? Even Siqi hasn’t complained!”

Guan Yu closed his eyes briefly, sighing. Aze’s careless words had dragged both Wang Jun and Siqi into the fray. Though Wang Jun stood slightly taller than Siqi, the latter now shot Aze an irritated look.

Siqi gripped Guan Yu’s arm, using his hand to swat at Aze. “Aze! Must you always speak so thoughtlessly? You’re insufferable!”

“He deserves worse,” Wang Jun grumbled. Guan Yu remained neutral, though he knew Aze risked collective wrath if he continued.

At that moment, a man in opulent robes ascended the擂台 (platform). A middle-aged woman near Guan Yu remarked, “The Zhao family spares no expense! Everything they do is grand.”

“Indeed,” another added. “Their daughter’s practically a recluse—a proper young lady who’s never stepped outside. They say she’s nearly eighteen! Quite old to remain unwed.”

The crowd buzzed with mostly women discussing neighborhood gossip, though many young men had also come—some curious bachelors, others hoping to climb the Zhao family’s social ladder through this contest.

“I’ve seen the Zhao heir several times,” a woman continued. “That portly young master parades about with entourages of beauties. Yet despite living nearby for years, I’ve never glimpsed their daughter!”

**Chapter 4388: Gifts**

Guan Yu found it curious that the Zhao daughter remained so mysterious. If even neighbors hadn’t seen her, had no matchmakers approached? The woman’s description of the obese heir lent credence to Wang Jun’s earlier claims.

Here, a woman’s value diminished rapidly with age. Most married by thirteen or fourteen, making eighteen practically ancient. Families grew desperate to wed such “old” daughters before they became unmarriageable. Wealthy men preferred youthful brides who’d maintain their looks longer.

The richly dressed man onstage raised his hands for silence. “Thank you all for attending my daughter’s momentous day! Enjoy the festivities, and feel free to participate. Gifts will be distributed later!”

Clearly the Zhao patriarch, he yielded to a plainer-dressed steward who announced: “Our rules are simple! Qualified challengers must first defeat our household guard, then our young mistress. Victorious candidates may still be rejected by her, but all participants receive gifts. Should no suitor be chosen, our mistress will toss an embroidered ball. The catcher may request any item from her within reason.”

“Ridiculous!” Aze whispered to Wang Jun. “Martial contests usually bind the winner to marry. This selective refusal undermines tradition!”

“Wealth bends rules,” Wang Jun shrugged. “The Zhaos can afford whims.”

Guan Yu observed, “The gifts likely motivate many participants. This might be mere spectacle.”

“Their ‘aged’ daughter must be hideous,” Wang Jun sneered. “Even if she chose someone, who’d want a combative spinster lacking feminine grace?”

As they debated, three figures ascended the stage—two plainly dressed maids flanking a red-gowned woman whose face was veiled below the eyes. Gasps rippled through the crowd as the maids unveiled trays of golden ingots.

The steward declared, “Challengers who defeat our mistress but are rejected shall receive gold—quantity depending on her mood!”

Wang Jun’s eyes gleamed. “Guan Yu, assess her skills. If manageable, I’ll try for that gold!”

“Let’s all take turns!” Aze enthused. “We could split twenty ingots!”

Guan Yu demurred, studying the muscular guard and veiled mistress. “Aze, you’d best abstain. Your close-combat skills are weak.”

“You doubt me?” Aze protested. “That delicate thing can’t fight!”

“Underestimate her at your peril,” Guan Yu warned. “The Zhaos wouldn’t offer gold lightly. She may possess hidden prowess.”

As challengers stepped forward, the steward added, “Weapons are permitted, but no hidden projectiles!”

**Chapter 4389: Gossip**

Though veiled, the Zhao daughter’s graceful figure and luminous eyes suggested beauty. Her fair neck and hands hinted at flawless skin, while restless glances betrayed lively curiosity.

“See how slender she is?” a matron whispered. “The family must’ve fed all their delicacies to the son!”

“A shame she hides her face,” another agreed. “Might actually be pretty.”

Guan Yu noted the mistress’s poised bearing. “Wang Jun, you may try. But Aze—stay back. That woman’s no ordinary fighter.”

“Magic could overwhelm her!” Aze insisted.

“Arrogance invites downfall,” Guan Yu cautioned as the first challenger approached.
