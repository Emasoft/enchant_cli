Moreover, Guan Yu had repeatedly emphasized to her that Jinhua’s identity must never be revealed to anyone—a warning Ling’er had always kept firmly in mind.

She had long known Guan Yu had another friend in the apartment, presumably Jinhua. Thus, Ling’er called Pan Taisheng.

“Ling’er? What brings your call? Are you in trouble? Is this about Guan Yu again?” Pan Taisheng asked curiously.

Earlier, Xue Jing had already contacted Pan Taisheng, but he believed that with Guan Yu’s formidable cultivation, there was no real danger. Perhaps he had simply grown bored at home and decided to wander alone for a few days—nothing worth fussing over.

Yet after receiving Ling’er’s call, Pan Taisheng’s own anxiety began to rise.

“Yes, Brother Pan. Brother Guan Yu might truly be in trouble,” Ling’er said.

Pan Taisheng chuckled reassuringly. “You’re all too paranoid. Guan Yu’s a grown man with extraordinary abilities. What could possibly happen to him?”

“This time is different. Brother Pan, think—even when Guan Yu left before, he never kept his phone off this long. No one’s seen him, which is the strangest part. In the past, wherever he went, people always knew his whereabouts. But this time… it’s too secretive.”

The more Pan Taisheng listened, the more uneasy he became. “Could something really have happened? With Guan Yu’s skills, it shouldn’t be possible…” His own tone betrayed his doubt.

Ling’er pressed, “Brother Pan, you must know Guan Yu has another friend in the apartment, right?” The question instantly reminded Pan Taisheng of Guan Yu’s mysterious acquaintance, but he had sworn secrecy. “I don’t know. As far as I’m aware, you’re his only friend here.”

“Oh, never mind. I just thought Brother Guan might be at that friend’s place. Sorry to bother you, Brother Pan. Bye.” Ling’er hung up.

Ling’er, sharp and perceptive, knew Pan Taisheng was lying—likely on Guan Yu’s orders, given Jinhua’s特殊性. She wasn’t angry, only hoping Pan Taisheng would deduce her hint and check Jinhua’s apartment.

After ending the call, Pan Taisheng conceded Ling’er’s logic. Guan Yu’s friend was indeed enigmatic. Though unclear why, Pan Taisheng would guard the secret even at gunpoint.

Knowing Jinhua’s unit, he changed clothes, donned a low-brimmed cap, and approached her building. Her lights were on. Cautiously ascending, he knocked.

*Knock, knock, knock…*

Silence. Puzzled, he knocked again. Still no response. Perhaps Guan Yu had instructed her to ignore visitors unless he called first.

Undeterred, Pan Taisheng dialed her landline. Through the door, he faintly heard the ringtone—unanswered.

“Could she be out?” he muttered. Unable to enter, he devised another plan.

Hurrying to the security office, he dismissed the guards playing chess and reviewed surveillance footage. Rewinding slowly, he spotted Guan Yu’s van entering the complex two days prior. Guan Yu exited, avoiding cameras but recognizable.

“Two days ago…” Pan Taisheng gasped. Had Guan Yu been inside ever since? The van remained parked below. Rewatching at half-speed confirmed it—Guan Yu hadn’t left.

Two days without emerging? Unlikely. They’d need groceries. Yet the unanswered phone gnawed at him. Why would Guan Yu’s phone die? Something was wrong.

“No time to waste,” Pan Taisheng muttered, rushing back. He pounded the door. “It’s Brother Pan! Open up!” Silence.

Using lockpicks, he opened the door—and froze. Guan Yu and Jinhua lay unconscious on the floor, dried blood staining their faces. Jinhua’s七孔流血 (seven orifices bleeding) horrified him, yet both still breathed.

Clueless about cultivation mishaps, Pan Taisheng called his sister, Pan Xiaoxia. Upon arrival, she assessed the scene: bloodstains, a golden dagger, and an ancient leather book.

Checking pulses, she paled—Guan Yu had no discernible pulse yet breathed. His meridians were severed, organs damaged, and his dantian’s Qi Sea vanished. “His cultivation… gone?”

“How is he?” Pan Taisheng urged.

“To the beds—now!” Pan Xiaoxia ordered. After settling them, she attempted healing Guan Yu, instructing, “Close the door. No disturbances.”

Pan Taisheng tended to Jinhua, trickling water into her mouth. She awoke weakly, rasping, “Brother Pan… where’s Guan Yu?”

“He’s resting. My sister’s aiding him,” he lied, masking Guan Yu’s critical state.

**Chapter 2459: Not Good at Lying**

Pan Taisheng, flustered, cooled boiled water in the fridge, fed Jinhua via straw, and ordered nutrient-rich meals. Delivering them, he reassured her before calling Ling’er.

“Guan Yu’s safe but delayed. Inform Qiaoyuan District—discreetly.”

“Thank you, Brother Pan.”

“We’re family. But remember—his friend’s identity stays hidden.”

“Why not tell Xue Jing yourself?”

“I’m… not good at lying,” he admitted. Guarding Jinhua’s secret outweighed all, even as Guan Yu fought for life.
