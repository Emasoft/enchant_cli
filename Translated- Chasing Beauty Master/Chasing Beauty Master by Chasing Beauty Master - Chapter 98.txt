Now Guan Yu truly understood the sensation of being abruptly elevated to the heavens. The elderly gentlemen warmly pulled him aside, taking turns admonishing him with overlapping remarks.

"Guan Yu, how could you not inform me about such a major event as your opening ceremony? If Old Xu hadn't called me, I'd still be kept in the dark! Did this old man not deserve an invitation?" Old Lin frowned in mock displeasure, his eyes twinkling with humor.

"You misunderstand! I merely thought such trivial matters weren't worth troubling esteemed elders like yourselves."

"Nonsense! Our bones are growing moss from idleness. We came to drink your wine!" Old Lin chuckled, gesturing to the thirty-something man beside him. "This is my son Lin Dafu, who now manages the Lin family affairs. You youngsters should become better acquainted."

The unfamiliar man possessed striking features - arched brows beneath a noble forehead, eyes bright as stars, and an innate air of authority that marked him as extraordinary. Guan Yu recalled not seeing him at previous gatherings.

"Greetings, brother. My father told me of your assistance. I've been wanting to express my gratitude personally." Lin Dafu clasped his hands respectfully.

"You honor me too much, Elder Brother Lin." Guan Yu responded with equal courtesy. When others extended courtesy, only a fool would presume upon favors.

The elders showered Guan Yu with praises, commending Old Feng's discernment in mentoring such an exceptional youth. His display of prowess during the previous gathering had thoroughly awed them all - none present could currently match Guan Yu's capabilities.

The unprecedented gathering of Nanjing's four remaining major factions after the Xu family's expulsion caused waves of astonishment. Luo Cheng's street-level associates gaped as faction leaders materialized in their humble territory, pestering him for explanations.

If the convergence of gang leaders wasn't startling enough, the arrival of Boss Liu and his entourage elevated the spectacle. "Apologies for my tardiness, brother! May prosperity flow like rivers!" Liu's booming greeting died abruptly as he registered the assembled dignitaries.

The current faction bosses and retired patriarchs swiveled to stare at the newcomer. "So... many guests!" Liu stammered, plump face flushing as he shot Guan Yu a panicked look. Dragging the host aside, he whispered urgently, "Why are these old ghosts here?"

"Historical grudges?" Guan Yu murmured back.

Liu grimaced. "My uncle - the elder you saved - has feuded with them for decades. He's arriving shortly. Brace yourself!" With this warning, the gang leader beat a hasty retreat to converse with Luo Cheng, whose status had risen dramatically through association.

Chapter 238: The Provincial Department Director?

"Since when does Boss Liu fraternize with our motorcycle gang?" low-level members whispered incredulously as they observed the unprecedented mingling of factions.

"All credit to Brother Yu's influence," a savvy member drawled, legs casually crossed. "They come for his face."

Guan Yu's attention snapped to the entrance where Old Liu arrived, the antique-collecting elder whose background remained mysterious. Despite his ignorance of the man's history, Guan Yu felt moved by the patriarch's personal attendance.

As Guan Yu escorted the elder inside, Old Liu froze upon spotting the four faction leaders. "Why are they here?" he demanded, eyes narrowing.

"They came to congratulate me. You know them?" Guan Yu's stomach dropped at the sudden tension.

Old Feng rose with mocking courtesy. "Ah, Director Liu graces us! To what do we owe this honor from our esteemed former Provincial Security Chief?"

The kindly old collector transformed into a thunderous magistrate. "You dare cause trouble here? Think retirement protects you? One word from me still brings down inspections! Disperse immediately!"

Guan Yu gaped at the metamorphosis. This unassuming antique enthusiast had been Provincial Security Director?

"Retirement suits you, old foe," Old Feng sneered. "We're here for our disciple's celebration. Save your posturing."

"Disciple? Whose disciple?" Old Liu spluttered.

Coughing awkwardly, Guan Yu interjected, "Grandfather Liu, he's... my master."

"Master?!" The elder whirled to examine Feng Xin. "That explains the familiar girl - Old Feng's granddaughter from the highway incident!"

As Feng Xin stared blankly at the unrecognized elder, Old Liu dragged Guan Yu aside. "Why associate with these gangsters? Need protection? I'll have the Police Commissioner himself guard your shops!"

Before Guan Yu could respond, the elder dialed his phone. "Xiao Nie? My adopted grandson's opening ceremony. Attend and show support." Hanging up, he announced, "The Commissioner arrives within ten minutes."

Under Guan Yu's astonished gaze, the elder explained decades of conflict: As Provincial Security Director, he'd battled these gang patriarchs' illegal empires to a stalemate across their careers. "Even retired, I won't see you corrupted!" he declared, though Guan Yu noted the irony - the man's own nephew led criminal enterprises.

Chapter 239: Convergence of Shadows and Light

Guan Yu's attempts at mediation were interrupted by new arrivals - the Mayor, Party Secretary, Police Commissioner, and other officials swarmed in, drawn by Old Liu's call. The host found himself fielding simultaneous greetings from government elites and crime lords.

From his corner, Boss Liu watched wistfully. Never had his uncle shown such support to blood relatives. Across the room, Old Feng muttered to Old Xu, "The old bureaucrat moves fast - claiming him as grandson before I could make him family through marriage!"

As the noon ceremony approached, Guan Yu wrestled with protocol: honor government officials or crime patriarchs? The solution came from Old Liu himself. "We elders won't jinx you with our mortality. Let the current leaders cut ribbons - officials as themselves, gang heirs as businessmen."

The compromise worked flawlessly. Under fireworks and applause, Nanjing's visible and shadow rulers stood united, their temporary truce a testament to Guan Yu's inexplicable influence. In that moment, the motorcycle gang leader transcended street hierarchies, becoming the nexus where light and darkness converged.
