The energy brimming with vitality surged ceaselessly toward the sternum as if inexhaustible. The fractured bone was slowly regenerating—though "slow" was only relative to Guan Yu's perception. In the medical world, this would be considered an impossible miracle.

Guan Yu's face grew increasingly pale, beads of sweat forming on his forehead and streaming down his cheeks. Exhausted yet undeterred, whenever he felt his energy waning, he would free one hand to grab a honeycomb. Chewing while replenishing his strength, he continued treating Gao Wei's high-dimensional injuries.

For two days and a night without sleep, Guan Yu persevered. Ten honeycombs were consumed in this relentless effort.

Finally, as Guan Yu teetered on the brink of mental collapse, he withdrew his hands, wiped sweat that had dried countless times, and revealed a heartfelt smile.

His immense efforts bore joyous fruit.

Half of Gao Wei's fractured sternum had regenerated, and her lungs were no longer compressed by broken bones, allowing normal breathing. Her life was now out of danger, with only minor injuries remaining to heal.

"Whew."

Guan Yu exhaled deeply, grabbing two honeycombs to devour. Instantly rejuvenated, he prepared to continue without rest.

"Honeycombs are treasures, but we're running low. I'll need to gather more tomorrow," he muttered, eyeing the remaining eight combs.

Stretching, Guan Yu stood tall.

"Guan Yu..." Gao Wei's weak voice echoed through the cave.

"You're awake?" Guan Yu smiled warmly.

Blinking dazedly, she rasped, "We... we survived?"

Guan Yu chuckled. "Do I look dead to you?"

Tears streamed down Gao Wei's pale cheeks. "Thank heavens we're alive!"

As she recalled the plummeting descent, she remembered strong arms embracing her—Guan Yu had followed her into the abyss. Now, gratitude and budding affection overwhelmed her.

"Thank you," she whispered.

"Eat this—it's nourishing." Guan宇 offered honeycomb. "Good for... certain enhancements."

Blushing, Gao Wei accepted the comb. Her mobility limited, she relied completely on Guan Yu's care.

Another night passed.

At dawn, Guan宇 rose to find Gao维 flushed and breathless. Morning's natural reaction left him exposed. "Turn around!" she demanded.

After awkward moments, Guan宇 prepared breakfast. "We must continue treatment."

When his hands approached her chest, Gao维 recoiled. "This is your idea of medicine?"

"Specialized qi therapy requires contact," Guan Yu explained. "Your sternum affects breathing—this is necessary."

After tense negotiations, Gao维 relented. As energy flowed from Guan宇's hands, warmth spread through her body, mending bones and easing pain.

Suddenly, fabric撕裂声 echoed—her blouse disintegrated around healing hands. "You said my clothes would be ruined!" she cried.

"Concentrate," Guan宇 urged, continuing treatment despite exposed flesh.

By noon, Guan宇 collapsed exhausted. "Five more days," he gasped, "and you'll walk normally."

"Take it off completely," Gao维 commanded, resigned to her predicament.

Thus began days of intimate healing, trust forged through vulnerability, and bonds deepened in survival's crucible.
