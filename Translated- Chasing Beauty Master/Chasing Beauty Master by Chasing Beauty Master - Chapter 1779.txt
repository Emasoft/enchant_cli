Lai Lixia led several people to intercept the two True Sun Sect disciples who had just walked out, preventing them from approaching the Blood Stone.

The True Sun Sect elder declared, “Since Elder Zhao has spoken thus, our True Sun Sect is not one to be intimidated. Though we avoid conflict, we fear no provocation. If Elder Zhao has further tricks, unleash them. As long as I draw breath, I will not relinquish this Blood Stone.”

The standoff teetered on the brink of violence. Xiao Mei chuckled, “Guan Yu, isn’t it amusing? These factions pause mid-battle to argue principles, neither yielding. If it were me, I’d focus all my strength on crushing the foe first. Who has patience for chatter?”

“They’ve unleashed such a massive spell. Don’t you think they deserve a moment to catch their breath?” Guan Yu replied wryly. “Don’t fret—they’ll clash again soon.”

As soon as he spoke, another group emerged from the opposite mountainside. Ling Su, positioned higher up, spotted them first and shouted, “Cease your fighting! The Demon Soul Sect approaches!”

“The Right Envoy is coming?” Guan Yu muttered, stepping forward to look. Indeed, a crowd ascended the slope. Though the Right Envoy was absent, the corpulent Altar Master from earlier was among them—unmistakably the Cloud Azure Sect.

Turning, Guan Yu advised, “I urge both sides to halt. If you exhaust your spiritual energy now, the Demon Soul Sect will slaughter you without mercy.”

At the mention of the Demon Soul Sect, Elder Zhao of the Red Lotus Sect paled. This complication risked losing the Blood Stone to their rivals.

Zhang La of the True Sun Sect, quick-witted, proposed, “Since the Demon Soul Sect approaches, let us temporarily set aside our dispute. At least avoid showing internal strife, lest they exploit it.”

“I agree,” Elder Zhao said, though his gaze lingered on the Blood Stone. “But this relic…”

“I have a solution,” Guan Yu interjected, exchanging a glance with Wang Jun before striding boldly to the Blood Stone.

The stone, the size of a human head, resembled glassy jade. Yet when Guan Yu lifted it, its weight surprised him—light as a wooden block of similar size. No ordinary object, this was a treasure.

He recalled Siqi’s Jade Ruyi, also embedded with bloodstones, though heavier due to metallic components. “I’ll safeguard the Blood Stone until the Demon Soul Sect departs,” Guan Yu announced, already storing it away. “As righteous sects, we must unite against them.”

*Once in my hands*, he thought, *you’ll not retrieve it easily*. Wrapping the stone in cloth, he fashioned a shoulder bundle.

Neither sect protested Guan Yu’s claim—the pragmatic choice. The Red Lotus Sect, though arrogant, recognized the greater threat.

The Demon Soul Sect group, having failed to find an exit, arrived warily. Wang Jun and Siqi stealthily joined Guan Yu, who warned, “Stay vigilant. The Demon Soul Sect is cunning. Avoid engagement unless forced.”

“Their forces here are all high-ranking experts—Helmsmen and above,” Wang Jun added. “Best not provoke them.”

Elder Zhao, still nursing injuries from his earlier encounter with the Right Envoy, remained silent.

“Found the exit yet?” Guan Yu taunted as the Demon Soul Sect neared. “Where’s Right Envoy Auntie?”

The Demon Soul Sect tensed at the united factions. Their leader, a Helmsman, demanded, “Why gather here?”

Guan Yu sneered, “Since when does the Demon Soul Sect dictate our movements?”

The Helmsman shifted tactics, jeering at Elder Zhao: “Surprised you survived our Right Envoy’s wrath.”

Elder Zhao seethed, but Guan Yu interposed, “Your sect’s arrogance won’t shield you from our combined might.”

The Helmsman scoffed, “Righteous sects? You squabble like dogs over bones. What unity?”

Guan Yu retorted, “Our disputes are internal. Against you, we stand as one.”

“Well said!” the True Sun elder echoed, morale lifting.

Undeterred, the Helmsman mocked, “True Sun Sect—burrowers emerging from rat holes. Still, less pathetic than rumored.”

“Enough!” Guan Yu’s roar reverberated with spiritual energy. “Leave now, or face annihilation.”

The Helmsman recoiled. Before he could respond, the Right Envoy descended, chiding her subordinates, “Lazing here while the exit remains hidden?”

Guan Yu smirked, “Right Envoy Auntie, scolding incompetents? Even your ‘experts’ fail. Perhaps you need a魔武双修 prodigy?”

“We lack such rare talents,” she parried. “Unlike you, content to loiter here a year hunting the Eight-Sided Drum Technique.”

“A year’s study beats eternal confinement,” Guan Yu countered. “But worry not—we’ll purge Miao City’s evils together.”

The Right Envoy’s smile tightened. “And if next July finds you still trapped?”

“Then you’ll share our fate,” Guan Yu shot back. “But rest assured—against your sect, our unity won’t waver.”

The Right Envoy’s gaze swept the united factions. With a curt gesture, she led her followers away, the unresolved tension hanging thick as mountain mist.
