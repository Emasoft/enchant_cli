“Xiao Wu, take someone to check if there’s an inn in this town,” said Jiang Yuankai. The group doubted such a small town would even have one.

Everywhere lay shrouded in darkness. Duan Ruxue felt uneasy, her mood heavy with trepidation. “Stay close,” she ordered, urging her maid to keep the carriage nearby. This was her first experience traversing such desolate places.

Guan Yu rode his horse in silence, unsettled by the town’s unnatural quiet. Not a sound pierced the stillness—an eerie absence that prickled his instincts.

Before long, Xiao Wu returned. “Sir, there’s an inn ahead. We’ve inquired—they have ample rooms. We can rest there tonight.”

“Good. Lead the way,” Jiang Yuankai nodded.

The so-called inn resembled little more than a dilapidated, oversized house. Its aged timbers groaned under the weight of years.

With candlelight flickering only here amidst the town’s pervasive darkness, they had no choice but to lodge for the night.

As before, Jiang Yuankai delegated lodging arrangements to his men, sparing Guan Yu the trouble. Guan Yu appreciated not having to handle every detail—Jiang’s retinue proved useful indeed.

Xiao Wu reported, “Sir, the courtyard behind the inn has rooms, but none as spacious as last night’s. We’ll need separate quarters for each.”

***Chapter 5048: Collective Interests***

Before others could speak, Duan Ruxue interjected, “That won’t do! I need the largest room—big enough for my maid and me. I can’t sleep alone here!”

Jiang Yuankai conceded, though inwardly noting her as the journey’s greatest nuisance. “Xiao Wu, arrange the largest room for Miss Duan—one that can fit three.”

Xiao Wu grimaced. “Sir, all courtyard rooms are equally small. The beds barely fit one. There’s truly none for three.”

“Then I’ll sleep in the carriage with my maid!” Duan Ruxue declared. Her displeasure hung thick—after traveling all day, even decent lodgings eluded them.

The rooms were indeed cramped, their narrow beds inferior to her carriage’s space. Unaccustomed to such austerity, Duan Ruxue knew fear would keep her awake alone.

Wang Xiaorong scoffed, “If you’re already complaining, wait till we camp in wild forests! If this frightens you, return to the capital’s comforts!”

“You think I chose this?” Duan Ruxue retorted. “I’m here for everyone’s benefit!”

“Enough bickering,” Guan Yu cut in. “Must you two clash endlessly? We’ve a long road ahead.”

He knew once women quarreled, it could last all night. “Move beds into one room. Miss Duan and her maid can share.”

Jiang Yuankai approved. “A sound solution. Xiao Wu, see to it.”

As Xiao Wu turned to leave, Qiqi added, “We three also need beds moved together! Without Wan Hong, I’d be terrified!”

“Understood,” Xiao Wu replied before departing.

The inn’s dusty tables and neglected air displeased all. Jiang Yuankai frowned. “This is the only lodging. We’ll endure it.”

“We should’ve stayed in yesterday’s city!” Duan Ruxue complained, though aware worse lay ahead.

Jiang had pushed to press onward to this town—a miscalculation. “At least we have rations,” he sighed. “Avoid the food here. Request tea instead.”

Guan Yu, wary of jianghu brews, called, “Bring wine if available.”

The burly innkeeper emerged with wine and tea. Guan Yu studied him—his rugged, sun-bronzed complexion ill-suited a sedentary innkeeper.

After Jiang paid with silver, the man left to tend horses. Guan Yu halted the maid pouring tea. “Wait. Let me test it.”

“Notice anything amiss?” he whispered.

Duan Ruxue shuddered. “Just this horrid place.”

Jiang soothed, “Miss Duan, your sacrifice is appreciated. We know this hardship is new to you.”

***Chapter 5049: No Poison***

His words disarmed her—she’d hoped complaints would secure greater treasure shares later. Now, his gratitude left her flustered.

Guan Yu tested drinks with a silver needle. “No poison. Though why serve heated wine?”

Duan Ruxue smirked. “Warm wine nourishes kidneys—but don’t overindulge.”

“Since when do noble ladies study kidney health?” Guan Yu teased.

“Common knowledge,” she countered. “Even Sir Jiang understands.”

Flushing, Guan Yu barked, “Bring unheated wine!”

The innkeeper explained, “Our homemade brew tastes better warmed. Let it cool if preferred.”

Guan Yu relented, grumbling about insinuations. Duan Ruxue hid a smile—men’s pride was so easily pricked.

Qiqi whispered, “This inn only thrives because of us.”

“Agreed,” Wang Xiaorong said. “The silence chills.”

“Drinks are safe,” Guan Yu reiterated. “But that keeper’s no ordinary host.”

Jiang nodded. “Stay vigilant.”

When Duan Ruxue spat her tea, Wang Xiaorong asked, “That foul?”

“I panicked hearing he’s suspicious!” Duan Ruxue admitted.

Guan Yu sighed. “It’s harmless. Just low quality.”

***Chapter 5050: Too Late***

“Sir Jiang,” Guan Yu pressed, “what’s your read on the keeper?”

“He’s no innkeeper,” Jiang stated. “That build comes from outdoor labor, not tending guests.”

Guan Yu agreed. “His weathered skin speaks of harsh travels. This place reeks of deception.”

Duan Ruxue paled, abandoning her cup. “Better thirsty than poisoned!”

“It’s safe,” Guan Yu insisted. “But stay cautious.”

Jiang added, “My jianghu instincts say trouble brews. Trust nothing here.”

As the maid poured tea, Guan Yu’s gaze followed the keeper’s movements—every gesture tinged with false humility. The night’s shadows seemed to deepen around them.
