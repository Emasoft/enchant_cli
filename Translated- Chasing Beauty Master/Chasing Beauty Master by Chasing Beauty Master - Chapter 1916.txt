“Especially Wang Xiaorong, from head to toe—whether her dress or the impeccably coordinated accessories—everything was flawless. Her exquisitely crafted features seemed beyond reproach, her beauty unparalleled. Having such a stunning woman before her made Duan Ruxue feel utterly eclipsed. For the first time in her life, Ruxue experienced this sense of inadequacy, this realization that someone could outshine her so completely.”

“Guan Yu nodded politely and stepped aside, gesturing, ‘After you, Sister Ruxue. Let’s discuss matters upstairs.’”

“Startled by Guan Yu’s address, Duan Ruxue glanced again at Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi but said nothing. With a nod, she led the way toward the staircase.”

“Ruxue felt these two women radiated an excellence she couldn’t match. Her own image paled in comparison—both in beauty and against Wan Hong’s dashing looks. They seemed a natural pair, heaven-sent lovers.”

“Soon, Jiang Yuankai arrived alone. As they discussed plans to investigate the northern abyss and its monstrous inhabitant, Ruxue privately hesitated. Though reluctant, she had no choice but to join—the journey aligned with her route to the East Sea. Despite the risks, she trusted Wan Hong and Jiang Yuankai’s prowess would ensure safety.”

“With plans finalized, they agreed to depart the next day.”

“By noon the following day, the group assembled at the northern gate of the capital. Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi accompanied them, now subtly disguised to avoid recognition—a precaution Guan Yu had insisted on. This not only tempered their striking appearances during the long journey but also hid their identities from the Yunqing Sect. Should sect members discover Guan Yu traveling with the Demon Soul Sect’s young mistress, complications would arise.”

“Chapter 5035: Provoking Trouble”

“If any Yunqing disciple reported seeing Guan Yu alongside the Demon Soul Sect’s heir, Patriarch Xuanming would surely investigate, possibly charging him with sect betrayal. Thus, concealing Wang Xiaorong’s identity became paramount.”

“Jiang Yuankai arrived with a dozen capable fighters. Guan Yu noted their martial bearing approvingly. ‘We’ll depart once Sister Ruxue arrives,’ he said, eyeing the laden cart. ‘You brought supplies?’”

“‘Necessities for the journey,’ Jiang Yuankai replied. ‘They’ll slow us but prove useful.’ Though Guan Yu privately doubted the wisdom of such baggage, he held his tongue.”

“‘We face extraordinary dangers,’ Jiang Yuankai added. ‘With the East Sea Dragon Pearl in my care, many will covet it. I rely on your counsel, Brother Wan Hong.’ His gaze flickered to the disguised women but he asked no questions.”

“When Ruxue emerged in a perfumed carriage rather than on horseback, Guan Yu sighed. The carriage, plus Jiang’s supply cart, guaranteed a slow pace. ‘Where are your guards?’ Jiang Yuankai asked, noting only two maids accompanied her.”

“‘You gentlemen are my protection,’ Ruxue smiled, descending gracefully. ‘What need have I for soldiers when such masters accompany me?’”

“Chapter 5036: Departure”

“Ruxue’s invitation for Guan Yu to ride in her carriage ignited tensions. ‘Those who can’t ride shouldn’t delay us,’ Wang Xiaorong snapped. Ruxue countered sweetly, ‘Then perhaps I should ride with Brother Wan Hong—in his arms?’”

“Jiang Yuankai interceded hastily. As the party set out, Guan Yu resigned himself to the snail’s pace. Ruxue’s presence as guide proved indispensable, though her coquetry vexed his companions.”

“By dusk, they reached Dongguan City. At the inn, friction escalated. Ruxue feigned fear, demanding Guan Yu stay until she slept—prompting Wang Xiaorong’s retort: ‘What proper lady makes such shameless requests?’ Jiang Yuankai posted guards at Ruxue’s door and retreated from the charged atmosphere.”

“Alone with Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong vented: ‘Must we endure that woman? Send her away!’ Qiqi echoed the sentiment. Guan Yu explained patiently, ‘She’s our only guide to the East Sea. Her antics are mere provocations—don’t take the bait.’”

“Chapter 5037: Mediation”

“‘Every moment with her infuriates me!’ Wang Xiaorong fumed. Qiqi nodded vehemently. ‘She’s deliberately seducing you!’”

“Guan Yu sighed. ‘Nothing will happen between us—this I swear. She taunts you because it amuses her. Stay calm, and she’ll lose interest.’ Though mollified slightly, the women insisted on sharing his room, refusing Ruxue any chance at private contact.”

“That night, as tensions simmered, Guan Yu pondered the long road ahead—a journey where personal clashes might prove more perilous than any monster lurking in northern shadows.”
