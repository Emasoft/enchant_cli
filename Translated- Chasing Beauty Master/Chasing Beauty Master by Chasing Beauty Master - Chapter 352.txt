“Right, a cheap man like him who swipes his face like a bus pass shouldn’t be indulged. We need to teach him a lesson he’ll never forget!” Mo Ling chimed in, her anger still simmering.

Guanyu, however, was secretly thrilled!

If Jiang Ziqi had been here to hear the women’s remarks, vomiting three liters of blood would’ve been the least of his worries—he’d have died of rage on the spot!

Guanyu wrapped his arms around the two women, soothing them with a smile. “Relax, you’re underestimating your husband. If I couldn’t handle a mere love rival, I’d be a laughingstock, wouldn’t I? Don’t worry—it’s settled. If Jiang Ziqi dares to eye my wife again, he’ll have to answer to me first. Otherwise, I’ll whip the bastard to death!”

Wenqing and Mo Ling stared at Guanyu in shock. They never doubted his words—he had no reason to lie. What baffled them was how he’d tamed a defiant man like Jiang Ziqi. Though curious, they didn’t press—a smart woman knows when to hold her tongue.

“Brother, I was so worried!” Zhao Jing’er’s eyes glistened as she fought back tears.

Guanyu gently patted her head. “I ruined your birthday cake today. Let’s make it up with a new one—I’ll give you an unforgettable celebration!”

Jing’er nodded vigorously, tears finally spilling over—tears of joy and gratitude. Guanyu wiped them away, comforting her until she calmed.

The night ended with laughter, Jing’er smiling sweetly thanks to Guanyu’s antics and his friends’ clowning. After the party, Tian Hao finally lost his virginity in a presidential suite with Hu Yuhan, courtesy of Guanyu’s “assistance.”

Guanyu, of course, seized the romantic night—though sharing a bed with Wenqing and Mo Ling remained a fantasy, holding Wenqing as they drifted to sleep was reality enough.

Dawn broke, and a phone call shattered their slumber. Wenqing drowsily answered, then jolted awake. “Mom?!”

**Chapter 887: Return to the Capital**

Wenqing bolted upright, sheets slipping to reveal creamy shoulders. Tears streamed down her face. “Grandpa’s critically ill—Mom says it might be our last chance to see him!”

Guanyu dressed swiftly. “Then let’s go. Your grandpa’s my grandpa too. I’m a doctor—if there’s breath, I can save him.”

Wenqing hesitated, then nodded. With Guanyu’s gravity-defying driving, they reached Beijing swiftly.

At a secluded villa guarded by security, they met Li Shu, the steward who’d once rescued Guanyu. “Hurry—the old man’s fading,” Li Shu urged.

Inside, a frail old man lay bedridden. Guanyu’s pendant glowed softly as his diagnostic system activated. The results puzzled him.

“Grandpa’s condition…” he murmured.

Suddenly, the door burst open. A威严的中年男子—Wenqing’s father, Wen Baoguo—stormed in, disdain dripping. “You’d neglect your grandfather for this playboy?”

Guanyu met his glare. “Uncle, I’m here to save Grandpa. Delay treatment, and you’ll regret it.”

Wen Baoguo scoffed. “You? A quack? Get out before I throw you out!”

Unfazed, Guanyu retorted, “Your threats won’t heal him. Let me do my job.”

The standoff crackled—a clash of generations, love, and duty, with an old man’s life hanging in the balance.
