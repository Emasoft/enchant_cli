Guan Yu gazed at Gao Wei’s profile—her jet-black hair cascading over her shoulders, the delicate upturned tip of her nose, slender lips, and crescent-shaped brows. Every smile and frown was utterly captivating. He stared, entranced, marveling at this winter beauty who seemed plucked from a snowscape.

Suddenly, a startled cry shattered his reverie.

Gao Wei, who had been walking by the lakeside, stumbled over something. Losing her balance, she tilted sharply to the left—a slope leading directly to the frigid waters below. A fall would freeze her into an ice sculpture.

Panicked, Guan Yu activated his gravity system and lunged toward her. Despite his speed, he was too late. As she began tumbling down the slope, he propelled himself forward, wrapping his arms around her as they both rolled into the lake.

*Splash!*

The thin layer of ice offered no resistance. Icy water engulfed them instantly. Guan Yu shuddered but stayed calm, submerged and searching for Gao Wei through the murk.

She thrashed wildly, her limbs flailing—a nonswimmer’s desperate struggle.

### Chapter 515: Take Off Your Clothes
The pitch-black night and glacial waters drained the color from Gao Wei’s face. Clenching her jaw, she tried to surface using scant first-aid knowledge, but her body betrayed her, sinking deeper. A sickly flush bloomed on her pallid cheeks as her chest tightened.

Finally, her breath gave out.

*Gurgle.*

She gulped a mouthful of icy water, her strength waning. Sinking faster now, her vision blurred. Death felt imminent.

As her eyes closed, a dark figure surged toward her through the water. An arm encircled her waist. Through the haze, warmth brushed her lips—a flickering flame in the cold abyss—and another warmth pressed against her left breast.

Gradually, that heat spread into her heart, reviving its faltering rhythm. Her chest eased, breath returning. Mustering strength, she forced her eyes open—and widened them in shock.

Though the lake’s depths hid everything, she sensed the kiss... and a hand lingering on her left breast. Too exhausted to resist, she allowed it, knowing this was Guan Yu saving her life.

When she’d fallen, her consciousness had wavered, but she’d glimpsed him leaping in without hesitation.

Relieved to see her awake, Guan Yu tightened his grip. One arm anchored her slender waist while his other hand remained on her chest, not to grope but to channel energy into her heart, sustaining its beat and her body heat. Simultaneously, he diverted part of his healing system to himself, conserving strength for their ascent.

*Breach!*

Two heads broke the surface. Guan Yu, energy depleted, stopped the treatment. He hauled Gao Wei ashore, hoisting her up by the hips. No time to dwell on their numbness—the cold gnawed viciously.

Onshore, Gao Wei hugged herself, lips purple, trembling violently. This wouldn’t end well.

Without hesitation, Guan Yu scooped her up and sprinted toward a lit convenience store they’d passed earlier. He pounded on the door.

A middle-aged woman cracked it open, scowling. “You lunatics! It’s—” Her insult died as she spotted the thick wad of cash in his hand.

“My wife fell in the lake. A room. All this is yours.”

The woman’s eyes glittered as she snatched the money. “Of course! Right this way—my room’s nice and toasty!”

The “room” was a cramped space with an electric blanket but no heater. Guan Yu frowned but handed her another stack of bills. “Hot water and dry clothes. Now.”

---
Once alone, Guan Yu stripped off his soaked shirt, revealing a toned torso. As he unbuckled his pants, Gao Wei gasped, “What are you doing?!”

“Changing. These wet clothes are torture.”

“Do it elsewhere!”

“Where? There’s only one room.” He stepped out of his pants, leaving just boxers. “Your turn. Strip.”

### Chapter 516: Domineering Tenderness
Gao Wei spun around, flushed—then whirled back, glaring. “*What* did you say?”

“Take off your clothes. You’ll catch pneumonia.”

“I’d rather be sick!”

He shrugged. Forced modesty vanished when her soaked dress clung to every curve, the fabric revealing nipples beneath absent lingerie. Her reddened face and damp silhouette screamed temptation.

Wrapping herself in a quilt, she shivered violently. Guan Yu, now towel-drying himself, smirked. “The landlady’s right—you’ll regret this.”

As if on cue, Gao Wei sneezed thrice.

“You’re burning up.” He pressed a hand to her forehead. “Off. Now.”

“No!”

“Stubborn.” He yanked the quilt away.

She fought, but he peeled the soaked dress off her shoulders, letting it pool at her feet. Clad only in violet Victoria’s Secret panties and pasties, her bare form trembled against him.

To her shock, he carried her to the bed, tucked her in, and activated the electric blanket. Sitting beside her, he ordered, “Give me your hand.”

When she refused, he seized it anyway. A cooling energy flowed into her, dousing the fever.

### Chapter 517: Come Up Here
Gao Wei tensed, expecting assault. Instead, clarity returned—her temperature dropped, mind sharpening.

“How…?”

He ignored her, focused on healing.

The landlady returned with ginger-infused cola, scolding, “Why’s she still clothed? You’ll ruin your health—and your future babies’!”

Guan Yu burst out laughing. “You heard her. Think of our children.”

“Shut up!”

But three more sneezes wrecked her defiance. Delirious, she didn’t resist when he peeled off her dress. Now under blankets, he clasped her hand, energy flowing.

Such domineering tenderness.

---
Hours later, warmth restored, the landlady delivered dry clothes. Guan Yu, still shirtless, patted the bed. “You’re stable now. Rest.”

She hesitated.

“I won’t bite. Unless you want me to.”

Glaring, she slid under the covers—as far from him as possible.

He chuckled. “Sweet dreams, *wife*.”
