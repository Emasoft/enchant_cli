Chu Hong found Guan Yu intriguing, not merely as a person, but because his gambling skills posed a subtle threat to her.

The ultimate purpose of running a casino was profit. Since Chu couldn't clearly discern Guan Yu's techniques, it implied his abilities might surpass hers. Such prowess spelled immense danger for her establishment.

No one sabotaged their own income streams. Casinos existed to generate wealth, not serve as personal ATMs. When Guan Yu turned 10,000 into over twenty million within half an hour, Chu made her move. She needed to halt his winning streak.

The gambling table still buzzed with excitement. When Niu Le asked if Guan Yu would continue, his affirmative answer felt like salvation to regret-filled onlookers. The casino manager's face twisted as if he'd swallowed a fly, contemplating blacklisting this menace and having him thrown out.

Suddenly, the crowd parted like the Red Sea. Gasps rippled through the throng as all eyes locked onto the approaching figure—particularly lingering on the twin peaks beneath her black evening gown. Without turning, Guan Yu knew his awaited protagonist had arrived.

Swiveling slowly, he feigned surprise at Chu Hong's striking appearance. Her oval face framed by willow-leaf brows, lips glistening like dewy petals, skin translucent as fine porcelain—the clinging gown accentuated every curve, its plunging neckline revealing dangerous depths.

*A femme fatale-level beauty. No wonder she runs this den.* Guan Yu mused inwardly, maintaining an aloof expression as she approached.

Utterly indifferent to the lustful stares, Chu Hong stopped before him with tinkling laughter. "What an honor to host Boss Guan here. I must apologize for not greeting you earlier. Please allow me to make amends as your host."

Her direct use of his name surprised no one—anyone in N City's underworld knew Guan Yu. Not one for subtleties, Chu Hong leaned forward, causing strategic tremors beneath her gown. Guan Yu's involuntary glance drew her inner sneer. *Men. All the same.*

Waving dismissively, Guan Yu countered, "No need for formalities. I'm just a student here for fun. Save your hospitality."

Chu's smile froze—the first time anyone had rejected her invitation. The crowd's disapproval thickened like smoke. Guan Yu noted wryly how effortlessly she weaponized desire.

"Very well," she recovered, sweetness undimmed. "Do notify me next visit. We can't have you feeling neglected again."

"Noted." Guan Yu's shrug dripped with insincerity.

*You arrogant pup,* Chu seethed internally before gesturing at his chips. "Enjoying your evening, Boss Guan?"

"Immensely." His grin widened. "Twenty million richer. I'll be visiting often."

The declaration drew mixed reactions. Chu mentally cursed—if this wasn't luck but skill, her casino would crumble within weeks.

"Regulars like you are our pride," she purred. "Had your fill tonight?"

"Hardly! Barely an hour in." Guan Yu played the oblivious fool, ignoring her implicit plea to quit while ahead.

Two thousand should've sufficed. By addressing him as "Boss," Chu signaled underworld courtesy—take the win and leave. But Guan Yu's refusal baffled her. Intelligence reports suggested sharp wits. Why spurn this olive branch?

Her suspicions dissolved when he leered at her décolletage. "Care for a private game, Miss Chu? Beats these dullards."

The calculated lust in his eyes reassured her. *So the indifference was an act.* She rewarded him with a sultry glance. "How could I refuse?"

Chapter 590: The Gambling Match

"What stakes interest you?" Guan Yu's gaze remained fixated.

Chu's laughter amplified her assets' oscillation. "Since you're here for novelty, let's play Show Hand."

Guan Yu rubbed his hands eagerly. "Perfect! Let's begin."

Internally, he cursed her cunning. This flirtatious display wasn't attraction—it painted targets on his back. Every lust-filled patron now saw him as competition.

As predicted, protests erupted. A wheezing, pot-bellied man emerged first. "Now Red, don't hog the new blood! Let's make it a party." Another joined: "Show Hand's better with company."

Chu's smile turned saccharine. "Gentlemen, why not join us in the High Roller Suite?"

Chapter 591: I Don't Know How

The High Roller Suite embodied opulence—crystal chandeliers, velvet drapes, where millions changed hands nightly. Only five players entered: Guan Yu, Chu Hong, two resentful tycoons, and a surprise fourth—a sharp-eyed newcomer who made Guan Yu murmur, "Interesting."

With 50 million on the table, preparations delayed the game. In a corner, Niu Le berated Guan Yu: "Boss, you're gambling five mil to impress some dame? Luo Cheng could use that cash!"

Guan Yu flicked his subordinate's forehead. "Relax. You'll sit beside me during the game."

Niu's indignation vanished. "Finally! My Show Hand skills'll save your amateur ass."

"Save your breath," Guan Yu deadpanned. "You're here to learn."

As attendants finalized preparations, Guan Yu studied his opponents. Chu Hong's plan was clear—let rivals bleed him dry through jealousy. But Guan Yu's smirk deepened. *Let them try.*
