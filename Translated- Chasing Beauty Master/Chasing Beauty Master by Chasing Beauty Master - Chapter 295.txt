“Guan Yu gave Feng Xin a commitment through his actions. Freed from constraints, the towering pillar plunged deep into the marsh.

A tear slid from the corner of Feng Xin’s eye – a mixture of pain and blissful happiness.

Though this was Feng Xin’s first taste of forbidden fruit, her thirty-year-old body burned with the fierce vitality of prime womanhood. Her passionate abandon far surpassed the timid explorations of twenty-year-old maidens.

Thus, the battlefield shifted from bathroom to bedroom.

After long suppression, Feng Xin finally achieved complete release. Her wild cries would have disturbed the household had Old Master Feng not wisely wheeled Guan Zhongfu out earlier.

After what seemed an eternity, the sounds gradually subsided.

Feng Xin nestled against Guan Yu’s chest, eyes closed, savoring post-passion tranquility. Guan Yu absently stroked her silken short hair, lost in thought.

“What are you thinking?” Feng Xin murmured softly.

*Slap*

Guan Yu’s palm landed on her tender buttocks. “Call me husband,” he growled playfully.

Feng Xin rolled her eyes but complied, “Husband, what occupies your thoughts?”

Their relationship had indeed been as Liu Shilei predicted – separated only by thin paper. Now that barrier broken, their bond advanced rapidly.

“I feel like everything just happened across lifetimes,” Guan Yu mused.

Feng Xin stiffened. “Do you regret this now?” she demanded angrily.

Guan Yu chuckled, drawing her close. “How could I regret having such a beautiful wife? I’m simply overwhelmed by how suddenly happiness arrived – like floating on clouds.”

Feng Xin smiled coyly, tapping his chest. “Sudden? I think not. Don’t pretend you didn’t plan this while ‘treating’ me. You’ve been anticipating today, haven’t you?”

Guan Yu grinned sheepishly. “Can’t deny I’ve entertained such thoughts...”

Their banter continued, Feng Xin’s feisty nature emerging as she playfully took control. When Old Master Feng returned hours later, the house echoed with passionate rhythms.

“Youth truly has its vigor!” the old man chuckled, tactfully retreating for another walk.

The lovers’ battlefield shifted between rooms and positions until dusk. Guan Yu suddenly noticed the culprit soap lying forgotten in a corner.

*Whoever claims dropped soap only leads to male dorm antics needs reality check!*

**Chapter 747: Mutual Understanding**

Soap – catalyst for both bromance and passion.

Exhausted, they finally emerged at nightfall. At dinner, Guan Yu remained composed while Feng Xin blushed conspicuously. Old Master Feng tactfully addressed the elephant in the room:

“Young ones should enjoy themselves... but spare thought for elders’ peace. Though I wouldn’t mind great-grandchildren before I depart!”

Feng Xin nearly buried her face in her bowl.

Later, Guan Yu faced his father’s quiet judgment. After tense silence, Guan Zhongfu sighed: “When recovered, I’ll return to the village. Treat Shilei and Feng Xin well – no more wandering!”

**Chapter 748: Chance Encounter**

Days later, Guan Yu met Lin Dong at a café.

“Still adjusting?” Guan Yu asked.

“Bored stiff.” Lin Dong remained his scruffy, enigmatic self.

Their banter turned to a passing beauty – oval face glowing with youthful purity, form-hugging jeans accentuating her curves. A rare vision of innocent charm.
