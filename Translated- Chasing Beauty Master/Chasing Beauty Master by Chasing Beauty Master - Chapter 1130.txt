“That’s right. Though she didn’t attack you herself, they’re clearly together. We must take them both back for interrogation,” the officer said while smoking a cigarette.

“Let me tell you, that girl’s looks—wow—she’s utterly stunning, breathtakingly beautiful,” Wang Erzi gushed, practically drooling as he spoke.

Hearing the girl was beautiful, the officer’s interest piqued. He asked curiously, “Really? Is she as exaggeratedly pretty as you say? She looked decent earlier, but with that mask on, you can’t see her face. Only her figure suggests she’s a beauty.”

“How could I lie? Before you arrived, she wasn’t wearing the mask. Damn, her face was like something out of a dream—so beautiful I couldn’t look away. Truly,” Wang Erzi replied, still obsessed with Ling’er’s beauty.

The officer stroked his chin, thinking, *I must bring that girl back. Once I order her to remove the mask, I’ll see how gorgeous she really is. If she’s as stunning as they say, I’ll find a way to have some fun. Heh heh. Once a woman enters the station, she’s no longer a woman.*

Tossing his cigarette butt aside, the officer resolved, *I can’t let that man off easy. The heavier his charges, the easier it’ll be to get to the girl.*

Turning to Wang Erzi, he patted his shoulder amiably. “Don’t worry, brother. That guy’s clearly trouble. I’ll make sure to help you deal with him properly.”

“Thanks, friend. I’ll treat you to drinks sometime,” Wang Erzi sneered. Though he’d lost the beauty, ruining that bastard was worth it. *Let him strut around now. After this, he’ll scurry away at the sight of me. How dare he cross me!*

As Wang Erzi gloated inwardly, the officer who’d gone to detain Guanyu suddenly rushed back.

An officer in the car barked, “What were you doing over there? It’s late! Do you want to clock out or not? Hurry up and bring them back! Why the delay?”

Wang Erzi also grew impatient. *Why’s it taking so long to drag one person into the car?*

The officer outside stammered, “S-Squad Leader Shi, we can’t take him. His connections are too powerful!”

“Oh? What connections? I’ve got backing too!” Wang Erzi blustered.

The panicked officer outside explained, “Yang Conghan—the Yang family’s eldest daughter—just called. She said if I harm a single hair on his head, I’m dead. Squad Leader Shi, what do we do?”

“What? Who did you say?” Wang Erzi shouted, dreading the name. The Yang family terrified him.

“Yang Conghan? The Yang heiress? The city’s top beauty? You sure you heard right?” The officer inside rattled off her titles.

**Chapter 2892: No One Leaves**

“Yes, her! That’s why I didn’t dare act. He refuses to come, and now… What should I do?” the officer outside pleaded.

The sharper officer inside asked, “Is the man named Guanyu?” He’d heard too much about Guanyu to risk provoking him.

Wang Erzi slapped his forehead. “Right! The girl beside him called him Guanyu. Guanyu… Wait! Guanyu, leader of the Yu Gang? *Him?*” Realization struck like a thunderbolt.

His earlier boasts about claiming the beauty and sending Guanyu to jail now seemed suicidal.

The officer inside, whose younger brother was in the Yu Gang, roared, “Stop wasting time! Retreat! Pretend we were never here!” Staying far from Guanyu—this god of calamity—was wisest.

But the officer outside said, “No. Miss Yang ordered none of us can leave. She’s coming here.”

“We’re finished. Utterly doomed,” Squad Leader Shi muttered. Still, since *he* hadn’t offended Guanyu, maybe an apology could save him.

Glaring at Wang Erzi in the backseat, Shi snarled, “You bastard! Lying to the police? You’re dead! Drag him out!”

Wang Erzi’s heart turned to ash. Guanyu had warned he’d lose his job. Now, facing the Yu Gang’s wrath, survival seemed impossible.

As officers roughly hauled him toward Guanyu, Squad Leader Shi fawned, “Sir, we’ve uncovered the truth. This scum framed you. We’re handing him over for your judgment.”

Wang Erzi spat, “You traitor! Weren’t you just plotting to assault his woman? You coward!”

“Silence! How dare you slander me?” Shi retorted. “Would I disrespect Leader Guanyu’s woman? I value my life!”

Guanyu watched their farce coldly. “Aren’t *you* the law? Earlier, you vowed to jail me. Let’s go now.”

“N-no! Please, pretend we weren’t here!” Shi begged.

Guanyu glanced into the distance. “Too late.” A white luxury car approached—Yang Conghan’s. The officers paled.

**Chapter 2893: Damage Control**

Within moments, the car stopped beside Guanyu. A blue high heel emerged, followed by Yang Conghan in a sky-blue dress, face hidden behind a mask and oversized sunglasses.

After shooting Guanyu a reproachful look, she dialed a number. “Director Zhang? Verify if these are your men.”

She activated the speakerphone. A trembling Shi said, “Director, it’s a misunderstanding. We’re explaining—”

“Explain nothing! Apologize now!” the director thundered. “Guanyu wouldn’t trouble small fries unless provoked. I’ll deal with you later!”

“Y-yes! Our fault entirely!” Shi bowed deeply to Guanyu. “Deepest apologies, sir. We were deceived!”

Guanyu gestured at Wang Erzi. “Today’s duty doesn’t blame you. But him…”

Wang Erzi, already a broken man, knew his life in City A was over.

Yang Conghan hung up. “Guanyu, let me handle this. Why isn’t Jingjing with you?” Her gaze flicked to Ling’er.

“I came to see Pan Taisheng. Didn’t expect trouble,” Guanyu lied.

Ling’er guessed he avoided mentioning their real errand to prevent misunderstanding.

Yang Conghan, too sharp to fully believe him, didn’t press. “I’ll manage this. You go.”

“Not yet. He broke my friend’s leg. He pays the medical bills and faces consequences,” Guanyu insisted.

After viewing Ling’er’s video of Wang Erzi assaulting a child and elderly man, Yang Conghan glared. “You dare threaten innocents? Do you know what ‘death’ means?”

Wang Erzi clung to futile hope—maybe bribing the Yangs could salvage this.

Yang Conghan ordered Shi, “Process this evidence. Ensure full compensation and punishment. If unsatisfied, I’ll send lawyers.”

“Understood! Swift and thorough!” Shi vowed.

As officers dragged Wang Erzi away, Guanyu thanked Yang Conghan.

“Flatterer,” she replied, voice muffled by the mask. “You’d have solved this ten ways without me. You just wanted it settled fast for your next task.”

Though her face was hidden, her tone held a tinge of reproach. Ling’er noted Yang Conghan spoke more gently to Guanyu than her usual icy demeanor.

“My apologies for troubling you,” Guanyu said.

“No trouble. I’ve little to do anyway.” Pausing, she added softly, “I wouldn’t mind you troubling me more often… I’ll go now. Shi will update you.”

Her car sped off. Guanyu watched it vanish, musing, *What man could ever tame her?* Winning Yang Conghan’s loyalty fully would require careful effort.

Her perfection—in looks, intellect, poise—left no flaw. Guanyu’s aloofness stemmed not from neglect but caution. The Yangs’ ambiguous stance made alliance uncertain. With their patriarch, a Boundary Sovereign expert, being formidable, Guanyu tread carefully.

For now, Yang Conghan was his only leverage. By keeping her longing through calculated distance, he might sway the Yangs’ position. A proud woman like her, who scorned ordinary men, might only open to the Yang family’s savior.

**Chapter 2894: Generous Treatment**

The road ahead risked conflict with the Yangs. Guanyu needed time to strengthen while avoiding their wrath. Yang Conghan’s heart, carefully cultivated, could be key. His current coldness was strategic—stoking her attachment through absence.

After all, even the most flawless jade has fissures. And Yang Conghan’s fissure, Guanyu suspected, bore his name.
