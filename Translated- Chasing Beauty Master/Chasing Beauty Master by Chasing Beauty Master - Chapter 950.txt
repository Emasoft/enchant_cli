Guan Yu also shook his head helplessly and said, “Alright, the matter is resolved now. It was all a misunderstanding. What I really want to know is how Yaoyao learned Wei Hongwei was in the cafeteria?”

His question redirected everyone’s attention to Qian Yaoyao. Jia Bo hadn’t considered this either—how had Qian Yaoyao received this information? During summer vacation, she shouldn’t have been casually visiting the campus.

Wei Hongwei chimed in, “Yeah, Yaoyao, how did you know Jia Bo and I were in the cafeteria? Did you just guess?”

Furrowing her brows in concentration, Qian Yaoyao explained, “Someone called and told me. They even sent me a photo. When I saw it, I was furious and went straight to the cafeteria to investigate.”

“When I arrived, I actually caught you doing that shameful thing! Of course I was angry—that’s why I kicked you so hard. If you don’t believe me, look—the photo’s still on my phone.” She pulled up the image and showed it to the group.

After examining the photo, Guan Yu remarked, “This was taken from behind Wei Hongwei. Clearly, the sender intended for Yaoyao to see it.” He turned to Wei Hongwei. “Take a good look. Do you remember who was standing in this spot?”

Wei Hongwei shook his head vigorously. “No idea! The angle’s from near the private room entrance. Someone must’ve sneaked in, snapped the photo, and left. I didn’t notice anyone coming in.”

Qian Yaoyao tossed her phone onto the sofa, visibly upset. “Hmph! You were too busy undoing your pants to care about anything else. Your mind was glued to that little tart in your arms—you didn’t even notice me barging in, you shameless creep!”

Wei Hongwei scratched his head awkwardly, at a loss for words. Guan Yu interjected, “This photo was deliberately sent to provoke Yaoyao and create conflict. Then they arrested Jia Bo to destabilize us.”

“Boss, something occurred to me…” Jia Bo suddenly spoke up. “When I went to the cafeteria, I knew Private Room 19 was reserved for Ge Yinglai. I hadn’t planned to approach her, but she came to me first.”

“You know how stunning Number 19 is—any man would’ve folded. Since she initiated it, how could I refuse? That’s how things escalated.”

“Disgusting! How can you admit such vile behavior?” Qian Yaoyao spat. Lü Mei grew even angrier, jabbing a finger at Jia Bo. “You men are all trash! You forget your own names when some pretty junior flutters her lashes. Why would Guan Yu ever call scum like you brothers?”

As Lü Mei’s tirade grew harsher, Guan Yu cleared his throat. “Obviously, someone’s targeting me through you two. Be more cautious moving forward.”

Realizing it was time to investigate Ge Yinglai’s influence and curb his arrogance, Guan Yu wrapped up the discussion. After settling matters with Qian Yaoyao, he returned to Qiaoyuan District with Lü Mei and Xue Jing around 9 PM.

Following dinner, Guan Yu strolled through the courtyard after assigning tasks to Jones and Hou Jinshun. Meanwhile, Ge Yinglai found himself blocked by a crowd at Kaihuang University’s gates.

“This is Kaihuang University’s territory,” declared a bold young man—Xiaoqi, one of Jones’ subordinates. “Our boss ordered no outsiders allowed tonight. Important matters are being discussed.”

Ge Yinglai bristled at the twenty-odd men barring his usual path to entertainment. “Do you know who I am? Who dares block my way? Tired of living?!”

His gang brandished weapons—knives, pipes, daggers—forming a semicircle. Xiaoqi’s group of six paled against their numbers, but held firm, awaiting reinforcements.

“Acting tough here means nothing,” Xiaoqi retorted. “My boss is Guan Yu. Take it up with him. If he says enter, I’ll step aside. We’re just following orders.”

Headlights pierced the scene as a black van arrived, disgorging a dozen middle-aged men led by Jiang Fenju, Jones’ right-hand man. Ge Yinglai’s student lackeys faltered before these hardened fighters.

“Boss heard you might need help,” Jiang Fenju announced. “Who’s the punk causing trouble?”

Ge Yinglai’s gang retreated as Jiang Fenju’s aura of cultivation prowess loomed. “The boss’ orders: No outsiders tonight. Forceful entrants get broken legs.”

Xiaoqi gestured at Ge Yinglai’s armed group. “They were about to attack until you arrived.”

“WHO’S THE COWARD DARING TO MAKE TROUBLE HERE?!” Jiang Fenju’s roar, infused with inner energy, sent Ge Yinglai’s men stumbling back.

Clenching his fists, Ge Yinglai opted for retreat, realizing his outnumbered position. Back in his car, he dialed Madam Ji. “Sis Ji, Guan Yu’s blocking the gates. How’s business supposed to run?”

“What?! I knew nothing about this!” Madam Ji exclaimed. “No wonder there’s no customers! What’s Guan Yu playing at?”

“Handle it quickly.” Ge Yinglai hung up, smirking. “If she’s unaware, Guan Yu’s acting alone. This is personal.” He dispatched a lackey with whispered instructions.

Madam Ji immediately called Guan Yu. “What’s your game blocking the gates? You’re ruining my business!”

Guan Yu feigned innocence. “Sis Ji, I’m protecting campus safety. Your customers aren’t my concern—I didn’t block your cafeteria.”

“Don’t play dumb! You’re cutting my profits deliberately. Cross me, and you’ll regret it!”

“The regret will be yours,” Guan Yu countered coolly before hanging up. Inside, he found Sakurako studying a Chinese dictionary on the sofa. His plan to expose Ge Yinglai’s backers required escalation—chaos would flush out the rats.

Madam Ji mobilized contacts, starting with Commissioner Song at the district police bureau—a close “friend” reliant on her for discreet favors. Within minutes, four squad cars sped toward campus.

By now, Ge Yinglai’s reinforcements swelled to over a hundred. At the sirens’ approach, a subordinate warned, “Should we scatter?”

“Why? We’re not the troublemakers. Let the cops handle the blockers.” Ge Yinglai exited to greet Commissioner Song. “Thanks for coming! We’re here supporting Sis Ji—those thugs are gatekeeping illegally.”

Surveying the massive crowd, Commissioner Song frowned. “You brought an army but called us? What’s the play?”

“Just a show of force to scare them off. With your authority, they’ll back down faster.” Ge Yinglai’s flattery worked.

Approaching Jiang Fenju, Commissioner Song demanded, “Why block the gates without police involvement?”

“A student was assaulted here today,” Jiang Fenju replied. “Our boss Guan Yu ordered strict checks. Everyone entering becomes a suspect—including you.” He added pointedly, “Especially since Sis Ji’s… hospitality business upstairs might suffer if this goes public.”

Commissioner Song paled. Ge Yinglai scoffed, “Since when does Guan Yu outrank the police?!”

“The police should’ve been notified!” Commissioner Song blustered weakly, caught between duty and corruption.

Jiang Fenju pressed, “Do you really want this scandal exposing Sis Ji’s operations—and your patronage?” The unspoken threat hung heavy as tensions mounted under the flashing police lights.
