“Indeed, this Guan Yu really knows how to cause me trouble,” Lu Shouzuo nodded. “He was already troublesome enough, yet who could’ve imagined the women he brought would be even more troublesome.”

“Looking back now, Xuanming’s decision not to insist on Guan Yu cultivating at Tiger’s Head Peak was truly wise. Otherwise, having these friends of his at Tiger’s Head Peak would’ve created enormous complications.”

Dai Shouzuo inquired, “Sect Leader, there’s something I don’t understand. While our Cloud Azure Sect frequently accepts disciples and you rarely take personal students, Guan Yu isn’t your first. Since he’s already your disciple, why must we continue hosting his friends?”

Her implication was clear. She continued, “Guan Yu being a Cloud Azure disciple is one matter, but shouldn’t these unrelated so-called friends be sent down the mountain? If more disciples learn of this situation, it could create undesirable consequences.”

Xuanming acknowledged her concern. “Guan Yu’s friends remain here because they’ve nowhere else to go. They’ll stay temporarily at Front Return Peak until Guan Yu completes his preliminary cultivation of the ten Emperor Seal techniques. After he begins focused cultivation there, we’ll discuss his companions’ arrangements. We can’t simply expel them now.”

Lu Shouzuo agreed, “The Sect Leader speaks wisely. As the foremost orthodox sect, we mustn’t act improperly. Expelling them now would breed resentment from Guan Yu, discontent among disciples, and damage our reputation if word spread.”

Dai Shouzuo conceded the logic but countered, “Brother Lu, if Guan Yu cultivates long at Front Return Peak, will you host his friends indefinitely? If they cause frequent troubles as you say, aren’t you inviting hardship?”

“They’ve caused me no real trouble,” Lu Shouzuo waved dismissively. “They’re clearly close friends worried about Guan Yu’s absence. Just two naive girls – what mischief could they truly cause?”

Xuanming studied Lu Shouzuo with exaggerated suspicion. “Junior Brother Lu, I suspect your thoughts differ from your words.”

Dai Shouzuo’s eyebrows knitted as Lu Shouzuo blinked in confusion. A scandalous possibility occurred to her – could this centuries-old elder, despite having a wife and son, harbor designs on the young girls? The mental image of this “old cow eating tender grass” made her regard him with such distaste that he squirmed uncomfortably.

Xuanming pressed, “If I’m not mistaken, you’ve taken interest in one of Guan Yu’s companions?”

“Ah! I knew it!” Dai Shouzuo exclaimed. “Brother Lu, have you no regard for your reputation at this age? This would become the sect’s greatest joke! What would Sister Na think?”

Both men stared blankly until Lu Shouzuo sputtered, “What nonsense are you spouting? My interest lies with Jin Ciyu Lang (Second Only to Wolf), that First-Class Mid-Rank expert! What has this to do with my wife?”

“Oh!” Dai Shouzuo’s eyes bulged comically. “Your tastes... wait...” Realizing her error, she corrected, “You want that expert as your guardian?”

“Obviously!” Lu Shouzuo snapped. “What else would I mean?”

Relieved laughter filled the room. Xuanming chuckled, “Junior Sister, after knowing Brother Lu for over a century, is this how you perceive him? I’m shocked at your assumptions.”

Chapter 3174: A Flight of Fancy

“Enough jests, Sect Leader,” Lu Shouzuo grumbled. “Remember – return Guan Yu by tomorrow or those girls will pester me again.”

“I’m occupied these days,” Xuanming deflected. “Fetch him yourself. I grant you access to the back mountains.”

“I’ve pressing matters too,” Lu Shouzuo countered. “Let Dai Shouzuo’s disciple Siqi retrieve him. She’s the ideal choice.”

Before Dai could protest, Xuanming approved, “An excellent solution. Siqi shall fetch Guan Yu.”

“But Sect Leader!” Dai interjected. “Siqi bears the Jade Ruyi – a treasure inviting covetous attacks! Until she masters it, sending her out risks grave danger!”

Lu Shouzuo retorted, “Siqi’s safety is Aggregation Peak’s responsibility. The Sect Leader has spoken.” His tone carried clear retaliation for earlier embarrassment.

Changing tack, Dai inquired, “Brother Lu, can you truly retain this ‘Second Only to Wolf’?”

“I’m strategizing,” Lu admitted. “Sect Leader, since we gifted Guan Yu treasures, should we offer artifacts to win his friend?”

Xuanming shook his head. “Unlike Guan Yu who craves magic, warriors value artifacts little. Your only hope lies through Guan Yu – that man obeys him unquestionably.”

“Last night I plied him with wine,” Lu shared. “He claims complex ties to Guan Yu – kin, bodyguard, friend – but reveals nothing concrete.”

“Meaning you’ve no chance,” Dai scoffed. “A First-Class Mid-Ranker won’t be swayed so easily. This is pure fantasy!”

“Guan Yu’s a Boundary Sovereign!” Lu argued. “Yet he became our disciple!”

“Guan Yu’s different – his sealed cultivation forces reliance on our magic,” Dai countered. “Without that need, neither he nor his friend would stay.”

Their debate escalated until Dai proclaimed, “You’ll fail, but I might succeed. My advantage?” She preened. “Being a woman.”

Xuanming observed their rivalry – both recognizing the rare opportunity to secure a supreme guardian.

“You? Deploying feminine wiles?” Lu jeered. “A century-old widow versus his prime? Only a blind man would fall for that!”

Undeterred, Dai batted her eyes at Xuanming, who hastily vanished, muttering about urgent business.

Lu roared with laughter. “See? You’ve nauseated our leader! Spare us your antics!”

Unfazed by decades of such jests, Dai retorted, “My charms aren’t for you fossils. Jin Ciyu Lang shall be the judge!”

Chapter 3175: Calculated Risks

The argument revealed both elders’ determination to claim this prize. Dai realized through their banter what she’d previously overlooked – this warrior’s value warranted any effort.

“Save your pride, Junior Sister,” Lu advised. “Your ‘mature charms’ will only humiliate you.”

“We’ll see,” Dai smirked. “The man resides at your peak, but I’ll make my play. Fair competition, Brother.”

“Fair?” Lu sputtered. “I discovered him! At least wait until I fail!”

“And risk losing my chance? Never. I’ll pay whatever price needed.”

Lu warned, “Remember when we bid for Guan Yu? Two bidders doubled the cost! Must we repeat that folly?”

Dai remained adamant. “I’ll bear any loss. Withdraw if you fear expense.”

Recognizing her resolve, Lu departed in frustration, leaving Dai to scheme.

Next morning, Dai summoned her disciple Siqi to Aggregation Peak’s grand hall. The young woman entered with graceful steps, bowing. “Master, your summons?”

“Fetch Guan Yu immediately,” Dai commanded. “The Sect Leader permits this exception.”

“But he’s in secluded cultivation...” Siqi hesitated.

“Those at Front Return Peak worry for him,” Dai fabricated. “Escort him here first, then we’ll accompany him to Lu Shouzuo. Oh, and Siqi...” She eyed the Jade Ruyi at the disciple’s waist. “This outing will test your mastery. Prove yourself worthy of Cloud Azure’s treasure.”
