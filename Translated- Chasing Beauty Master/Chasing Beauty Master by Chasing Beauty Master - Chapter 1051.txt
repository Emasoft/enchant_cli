“After Second Wolf finished speaking, he immediately ran off. At first, Sky Soaring Wolf worried his opponent might possess formidable cultivation, but this apparent retreat convinced him the man was fleeing in fear.

‘You bastard! Let’s see where you run now! I’ll teach you a lesson today—stop right there!’ Sky Soaring Wolf gained confidence and gave chase.

Second Wolf’s entire purpose was to lure his pursuer away. Confronting Sky Soaring Wolf within the Yang Family’s auction house would be unwise. He needed to draw him to a secluded spot.

The faster Second Wolf sped through the bustling city center near the auction grounds, the more determinedly Sky Soaring Wolf followed. Finding a remote area in this commercial hub proved challenging.

‘Damn mutt, you cling tight!’ Second Wolf shouted over his shoulder, deliberately provoking to prevent his quarry from losing interest. He alternated between accelerating and taunting to stoke the man’s rage.

Before departing, Guan Yu had instructed Second Wolf not to let Sky Soaring Wolf escape alive. Now, the hunter prepared to toy with his prey.

‘Screw your mother! Stand still if you’ve got balls! I’ll cripple you, you turtle-spawned bastard!’ Sky Soaring Wolf roared from behind.

‘What makes you think I’ll obey? Keep chasing if you dare!’ Second Wolf continued baiting him.

After darting through crowded thoroughfares, Second Wolf veered into an alleyway where the path narrowed. Each turn led them deeper into desolation until they reached the secluded rear of a hotel, flanked by towering buildings.

**Chapter 2687: Too Arrogant**

The three-meter-wide passage stood empty. ‘Coward! Stop running and I’ll spare your dog life!’ Sky Soaring Wolf bellowed.

When Second Wolf halted abruptly, his pursuer mistook this for surrender. Without warning, Sky Soaring Wolf lunged forward, wolf claws gleaming, aiming to crush his skull.

‘Die, you pretentious trash!’

*Clang!* The metallic screech reverberated as Sky Soaring Wolf recoiled violently, arm numb from the rebound. Staggering back, he stared in shock—instead of flesh, his claws had struck a massive saber now being sheathed by Second Wolf, who turned with a mocking smile.

‘Impatient, aren’t we? Ambushing from behind—is this the honor of the Ten Great Evildoers?’

Sky Soaring Wolf’s confidence wavered. That strike should have shattered iron, yet his opponent had parried it effortlessly. Panic flickered as he eyed the ominous blade.

‘You dare mock one of the Ten Great Evildoers? You’re courting death!’ he snarled, clinging to bravado.

‘Death? Perhaps. But if you lose, don’t come crying.’ Second Wolf’s taunt ignited fresh fury.

‘I’ve met arrogant fools, but none like you! Today, you’ll learn the price of hubris!’

Yellow energy enveloped Sky Soaring Wolf’s claws as he attacked. Though confident in his superiority, Second Wolf remained vigilant—unorthodox techniques often hid nasty surprises.

Their clash revealed unsettling truths. Every strike from Sky Soaring Wolf met impenetrable defense, his attacks bouncing off like pebbles against a fortress. Second Wolf observed coldly, waiting.

‘A hidden master after all!’ Sky Soaring Wolf leaped back, reassessing.

‘Save your flattery. I sought to avoid this, but your persistence forced my hand.’ Second Wolf rested his blade on one shoulder.

Regret gnawed at Sky Soaring Wolf. Pride had blinded him to the danger. Still, retreat meant humiliation. ‘Enough talk! I’ve business elsewhere. Cross me again, and this’ll be your fate!’ He smashed a wall, leaving a crater before turning to flee.

‘Leaving so soon, Sky Hound?’ Second Wolf’s blade traced a crimson arc. ‘Did I permit your departure?’

The blood-red slash forced Sky Soaring Wolf to block. As yellow energy met scarlet edge, both recognized this wouldn’t end peacefully.

‘You asked for this!’ Sky Soaring Wolf spat blood onto his claws. The weapons glowed crimson as his body swelled, gray fur erupting across skin. Before Second Wolf’s astonished eyes, the man transformed into a monstrous wolf.

**Chapter 2688: Severed Leg**

The metamorphosis completed in seconds. The colossal beast lunged with doubled speed, forcing Second Wolf to serious combat.

*Boom!* Wolf claws met saber in a shockwave that staggered both. Second Wolf marveled at the enhanced strength and agility—this was no ordinary shapeshift.

Though the transformed state boosted power, it couldn’t bridge their差距. As a peak First-Class Honored Warrior, Second Wolf rarely met equals. When the wolf pounced again, he didn’t dodge.

His blade carved a crimson crescent. They passed each other—Second Wolf sheathed his weapon and walked away without glancing back.

In the alley, Sky Soaring Wolf reverted to human form, kneeling in a blood pool. His left leg lay severed, agony etched across his face. Torn clothes hung in rags, phone lost during the fight.

The变身’s price—ten days of weakness—now compounded by mortal injury. Even if he survived, his cultivation career was over. The promised 15 million would be cold comfort.

Second Wolf headed for a tavern, unconcerned. Guan Yu had already reached the Yang Family clinic where Xue Jing brought textbooks for Shuangshuang.

‘Your tutor arrives soon,’ Guan Yu said. ‘Study well here until you recover.’

‘I’m clever! I’ll catch up quickly,’ the girl insisted.

Xue Jing offered an apple. ‘She’s a top university student. You’ll get along.’

Guan Yu proposed transferring Shuangshuang to a city school. ‘Better education. Weekends you can visit Auntie.’

‘We can’t accept more help!’ Auntie protested from the doorway.

‘It’s my debt,’ Guan Yu countered. ‘Would you have me dishonored?’

Xue Jing suggested loans, but Guan Yu preferred covering costs outright. The debate continued—a family’s pride versus a child’s future.

**Chapter 2689: Obvious to Fools**

Auntie remained stubborn. ‘You’ve done enough with my medical bills!’

‘Let’s call it an investment,’ Xue Jing mediated. ‘Shuangshuang can repay after graduating.’

The girl’s eyes sparkled. ‘I’ll study hard! Smarter than everyone!’

Guan Yu smiled at her spirit. Sometimes, forcing opportunities was kinder than respecting pride. The matter wasn’t settled—but it would be.
