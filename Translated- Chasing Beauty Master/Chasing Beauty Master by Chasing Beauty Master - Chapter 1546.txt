The person kneeling before the elderly couple burning paper offerings was Xiao Zhi. Yet Du Bingyan's thoughts drifted to another man, recalling her first encounter with Xiao Zhi.

He had taken liberties then, earning a resounding slap from her. Now, reflecting on it, Du Bingyan felt a twinge of regret—that strike had been too harsh.

In the past, the passing of her parents might have extinguished her will to live. But now, death held no appeal. Another presence had kindled in her heart—a newfound attachment.

"Father, Mother," she murmured through falling tears, "your unfilial daughter failed to care for you properly. My lack of silver for your treatment drove you to this end."

The past year had stretched interminably. Each day brought not only caregiving burdens but the gnawing anxiety of poverty. Her parents' prolonged illness had shackled her possibilities. Their departure now felt like mutual liberation—for them and herself. How else could this endless suffering have continued?

Another memory surfaced: Xiao Zhi's parting words. *"If you have nowhere to go, seek me at the Cloud Azure Sect. I'll provide for you."* This promise had etched itself into her being. After three final days of mourning, she resolved to undertake this last pilgrimage—to find Xiao Zhi at the sect.

Her revived heart, once numbed by despair, now pulsed with purpose. Where was Xiao Zhi now? What affairs detained him? Had the swelling on his face subsided?

"Miss?" A middle-aged woman's voice pierced her reverie. Only when called a second time did Du Bingyan startle to awareness.

"Who are you?" She turned, attempting to rise, but numb legs betrayed her from prolonged kneeling.

Before her stood an enormously corpulent woman with grotesque makeup—chalk-white face paint, blood-red lips, and massive earrings.

**Chapter 4009: Why**

The woman's thick lips parted in a smile. "Dear girl, might I ask whose passing we mourn here?"

"My parents," Du Bingyan replied flatly.

"Oh! Your own flesh and blood! No wonder such grief." The woman leaned closer, reeking of opportunism. "But remember—all things have cause and consequence. To truly honor them, we must smooth their journey through the Yellow Springs. Let my revered sorcerer conduct rites to ease—"

"Auntie," Du Bingyan interrupted, "state your business. We are strangers."

Having neither friends nor family in this desolate riverside hut, she distrusted this sudden visitor.

"First meetings breed familiarity! I assist Master Huang Xian," the woman pressed. "We perform soul-guiding rituals to—"

"Enough." Du Bingyan waved her away. "I want no such services."

These corpse-chasing charlatans sickened her—preying on grief under the guise of tradition. Every funeral attracted vultures peddling worthless rituals. She'd not waste her meager coins, reserved for proper burial and her journey to the Cloud Azure Sect.

The harpy persisted: "Would you let your parents stumble through the afterlife? Our rites ensure—"

"Leave!" Du Bingyan's voice turned steely. "I'll not repeat myself."

Snorting, the woman waddled off with a curse: "Ungrateful wretch! May you die wretchedly too!"

Letting the insult roll off, Du Bingyan returned to her vigil. Three final days—this was her limit. Over the past year, she'd exhausted herself caring for her parents. Providing coffins and decent burial stretched her resources thin. Even with silver, she'd never fund these frauds' theatrics.

A new concern surfaced—would Xiao Zhi seek her at the clinic? Rising, she changed clothes to leave an address note there.

At the medical hall, the physician recalled: "Three men came for you this morning—the two from last night, plus another. They left when you were gone."

"Three?" Du Bingyan's heart sank. In her grief-stricken departure, she'd forgotten this possibility.

She handed the doctor a paper. "If those two return, please give them my address."

**Chapter 4010: A Familiar Face**

The physician slapped his forehead. "Ah! They left a note for you! But I... discarded it, thinking you wouldn't return."

Du Bingyan nearly screamed. The discarded message might have held Xiao Zhi's whereabouts!

"Wait!" The doctor brightened. "It mentioned the City Lord's Manor! Your friends stay there, departing tomorrow."

"City Lord's Manor?" Du Bingyan stared incredulously. Commoners never entered those august gates. How could martial artists lodge there?

Despite doubts, she hurried home, paid final respects at her parents' coffins, and set out.

**Chapter 4011: Gratitude**

At the manor, Guan Yu and Xiao Zhi watched opera performers warm up. Guan Yu's gaze fixed on a masked actor—strangely familiar, like someone from the noodle shop earlier.

Xiao Zhi shrugged. "Never seen that monkey-masked fellow."

As servants brought lavish dishes, Xiao Zhi's stomach growled. "When do we eat?"

"Should've finished your noodles this morning," Wang Jun teased.

Guan Yu's eyes narrowed. That performer... he'd definitely seen him at the noodle stall!

Their conversation halted as the City Lord approached, flanked by officials. Guan Yu suddenly understood why the banquet hall's layout separated diners from performers—security protocol for nobility.

Wang Jun whispered, "Still hoping to find your lady love before we leave tomorrow?"

Xiao Zhi smiled confidently. "She'll come to the Cloud Azure Sect. I feel it."

As if summoned by fate, distant commotion echoed through the manor gardens. But for now, the trio turned to greet their host, unaware of the familiar figure blending into the opera troupe—or the determined young woman approaching the manor gates.
