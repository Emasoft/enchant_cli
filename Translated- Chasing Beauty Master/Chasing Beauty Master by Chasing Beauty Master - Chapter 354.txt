“Mr. Wen, there are others present. Could you at least preserve some dignity for me in front of others?”

"Where are the outsiders here? We're all family!" Wen Shuquan retorted.

"Father, I'll lay it out clearly today—I will never and can never acknowledge this person's existence!"

Wen Baoguo understood perfectly well that Wen Shuquan's emphasis on "family" was meant to affirm Guan Yu's status, declare his own stance, and pressure Wen Baoguo into recognizing Guan Yu.

But from Wen Baoguo's position, he couldn't tolerate Guan Yu's existence no matter what.

"You..."

Wen Shuquan pointed at Wen Baoguo, his fingertips trembling with rage. Despite his clear, forceful stance, Wen Baoguo remained obstinate, nearly giving Wen Shuquan a stroke.

The atmosphere froze at this impasse.

Guan Yu chose this moment to step forward. Smiling at Wen Shuquan, he felt an unexpected warmth—the old man's staunch support and remembrance of his life-saving deed deserved respect.

"Grandfather, don't agitate yourself. Getting worked up might make you ill when you're actually healthy," Guan Yu said gently.

"Hmph! If I do fall ill, it'll be from his provocation!" Wen Shuquan glared at Wen Baoguo.

"Can you blame me? You pretended to be sick and deceived us all before. Did I complain then?" Wen Baoguo muttered.

His resentment towards Guan Yu grew. His own father sided with an outsider while berating him publicly—this stung anyone's pride.

"Do you have any shame? If I hadn't feigned illness, how could Guan Yu have brought Qing'er to see me early? Without resolving this conflict, how could our family prosper? You don't want grandchildren sooner, but I want the Wen family to flourish!"

Guan Yu flushed with gratitude—the old man had nearly sacrificed his health to secure his happiness.

"Grandfather, rest assured—I won't betray your expectations!" Guan Yu vowed.

His words held dual meanings: ensuring the Wen lineage's continuation through him and Qing'er, and proving his worth to Wen Baoguo through his own efforts.

Everyone present grasped the implications. Wen Qing blushed furiously while Wen Shuquan laughed heartily, growing fonder of this bold, responsible young man.

Guan Yu turned to Wen Baogoo with a confident smile. "Uncle, may we speak privately?"

"Say what you must here. But know that nothing will change my mind!" Wen Baogoo coldly retorted.

Guan Yu hesitated. "If I speak publicly... it might embarrass you."

"Enough! I'm leaving!" Wen Baogoo snapped.

"Very well." Guan Yu took a deep breath. "Uncle, your sallow complexion, trembling hands, and unsteady gait indicate erectile dysfunction."

The bombshell dropped.

Silence.

Then chaos.

Liu Yunshu, Wen Qing's mother, gaped in shock. Wen Baogoo's face purpled with rage.

"You dare slander me?!" he roared.

"I warned you to speak privately," Guan Yu said innocently. "But I can cure this."

Wen Baogoo seethed but hesitated. Liu Yunshu intervened softly, "Let him try. We've suffered this too long."

After tense deliberation, Wen Baogoo stormed to his study. Following, Guan宇 smiled at Wen Qing: "I'll handle your father."

In the study, tension crackled.

"Think curing me will make me accept you?" Wen Baogoo glowered. "Never!"

Guan Yu remained unshaken. "You'll agree eventually."

His confidence infuriated Wen Baogoo. But the temptation of a cure warred with paternal pride. Finally, he growled: "Prove it."

Thus began the treatment of Wen Baoguo's impotence—a battle of wills where medical skill clashed with stubborn pride.
