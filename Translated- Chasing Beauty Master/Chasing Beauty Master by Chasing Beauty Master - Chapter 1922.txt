“You truly are afraid of this and that. The real fear is yet to come—this is only the beginning.” Wang Xiaorong (Little Lotus) said with a dismissive smirk, then unceremoniously raised her teacup for a sip. After tasting it, she found the tea acceptable and continued drinking.

Since Guan Yu (Cosmos) had declared it poison-free, Wang Xiaorong naturally drank without worry, convinced no harm would follow.

Jiang Yuankai (Prime Origin) spoke up, “Another thing I’ve noticed: this inn clearly sees few visitors even in ordinary times. With no patrons and no upkeep, it’s fallen into such disrepair.

No guests mean no income. Yet when I handed over a silver ingot earlier, the innkeeper showed no change in expression—not a hint of joy. He took the silver and left without so much as a ‘thank you.’ That’s deeply suspicious.”

Guan Yu nodded, impressed by Jiang Yuankai’s seasoned insight. The observation aligned perfectly with his own unease—now he understood the source of his discomfort.

This place clearly generated no profit. The silver Jiang Yuankai had given far exceeded the cost of their stay. Any ordinary innkeeper would have been overjoyed at such a windfall, especially after a long drought of business.

Yet the man had shown no delight, nor any gratitude. A typical proprietor would have bowed and thanked them profusely for such generosity.

Guan Yu said, “You’re right. It seems we’ve stumbled into a place we shouldn’t have. I see two possibilities now.”

At this, Duan Ruxue (Snow-like) interjected, “Surely not? If the innkeeper truly meant us harm, why not simply poison the wine? That would be the simplest method.”

“No. Poisoning drinks is too crude—easily detected,” Jiang Yuankai countered. “Leaving the wine and tea untainted lulls us into complacency, making their true aim easier to achieve. Whatever their goal, we must stay vigilant. Brother Wan, share your thoughts.”

Guan Yu nodded. “First possibility: these people have taken control of the original inn staff. They anticipated our route and set this trap in advance.

Second: this is inherently a bandit inn, preying on travelers’ wealth. Both scenarios are plausible.”

He continued, “This afternoon, we took a shortcut that led us to this town. I suspect they’ve been lying in wait here—either rogue martial artists or hired agents. Their target is likely the East Sea Dragon Pearl in Brother Jiang’s possession.”

“What? That serious?” Duan Ruxue exclaimed, alarmed. “If we know this, why remain? Let’s leave at once!”

Guan Yu had only just pieced this together. The situation had shifted—the unnatural silence surrounding them suggested enemies already in position. “It’s too late to flee now. Have you not noticed Xiao Wu (Little Five) and the others are long overdue? Their delay likely means trouble.”

Before Jiang Yuankai could respond, he suddenly swayed, vision blurring as his strength drained. Collapsing back into his seat, he gasped, “The tea… it’s poisoned!”

**Chapter 5051: Control**

The group panicked at Jiang Yuankai’s state. Guan Yu frowned in confusion. “The tea shouldn’t be tainted—I tested it.” He glanced at Qiqi (Jade) and Wang Xiaorong, who had also drunk the tea. Only Duan Ruxue, who’d refused the brew, remained unaffected.

Yet while Wang Xiaorong showed no symptoms, Qiqi slumped against Wang Xiaorong, murmuring, “So sleepy…” before drifting off.

Guan Yu rushed to Jiang Yuankai, pressing a hand to his back to channel healing energy. “Brother Jiang, relax. Let me help.”

“Save your strength,” Jiang Yuankai rasped. “This poison merely nullifies inner energy. I’m weak but unharmed. Conserve your power for the fight ahead.”

Guan Yu turned to Wang Xiaorong. “You feel nothing?”

“Nothing at all,” she confirmed.

Duan Ruxue’s maid suddenly cried, “Thank the heavens I didn’t drink!”

Jiang Yuankai groaned, “I understand now. The poison wasn’t in the tea—it was on the cups!”

Testing a cup, Guan Yu’s silver needle blackened. The ruse became clear—the poison coated the vessels, activated by cooled liquid.

As Guan Yu deliberated, the innkeeper emerged brandishing a broad cleaver. Behind him filed eleven rough-looking men, their weapons glinting.

“Fools,” the innkeeper sneered. “You knew something was amiss yet drank anyway!”

Guan Yu ignored him, first ensuring Qiqi was tended to before assessing the newcomers. Their leader laughed, “Testing for poison now? Pointless!”

“I’d know my death’s origin,” Guan Yu retorted. “Where’s the poison from?”

The man smirked. “Our own creation—undetectable by ordinary means. It lies dormant in hot liquid, activating only when cooled.”

Jiang Yuankai growled, “So the famed Eleven Brothers of the Grasslands resort to poison now? Your reputation precedes you as formation masters, not backstabbers.”

**Chapter 5052: The Men from the Grasslands**

The innkeeper bowed mockingly. “We’re honored the Prince recalls us. Yes, we’ve studied your route carefully.”

Guan Yu feigned awe. “Such legends! How could I hope to best eleven masters?”

“Wise words,” the leader preened. “Had you drunk, you’d share their fate. But you interest me—why resist?”

Guan Yu leaned back casually. “A masterstroke, poisoning the cups. Yet why leave mine clean?”

Testing Duan Ruxue’s untouched cup revealed no taint—a puzzle until Jiang Yuankai interjected, “Their poison disperses qi. Even top masters become helpless.”

The Eleven Brothers grinned, confident in their trap. Guan Yu’s mind raced—their famed formation tactics meant coordinated attacks, not random strikes. If they fought as one unit, protecting the others might prove manageable.

“Enough chatter!” the leader barked. “Surrender the Dragon Pearl!”

Guan Yu stood slowly, a cold smile forming. “You’ve made one mistake.”

“Oh?”

“Assuming I need inner energy to fight.”

Before the words faded, Guan Yu moved—a blur of motion as the first attacker fell. The game had changed.
