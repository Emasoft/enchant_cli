Slowly turning his head, Guan Yu, still clutching Wang Fubin’s hair, violently slammed it against the wooden backrest of a nearby sofa. With a resounding *thud*, Wang Fubin’s skull collided solidly with the surface.

Dazed, Wang Fubin collapsed to the floor, not even given a moment to identify his assailant!

Rolling up his sleeves, Guan Yu strode toward Wang Fubin’s lackeys.

Surrounded by the mob, fists and kicks rained down, yet Guan Yu shielded his head and retaliated with precision. Each punch launched a body airborne as if struck by cannon fire. In the blink of an eye, six or seven attackers lay sprawled on the ground.

Cracking his shoulders, Guan Yu cast a frosty glare at the crowd before turning back to seize Wang Fubin’s hair again, dragging him toward the exit.

Dancers on the stage froze mid-performance. The music cut off. Every eye fixed on Guan Yu, this battle-hardened youth who moved like a god of war.

Yanked by his hair, Wang Fubin twisted his head and finally glimpsed his tormentor. At the sight of Guan Yu, his face blanched. Panicked, he clawed at Guan Yu’s thigh, struggling wildly.

With a sudden jerk of his arm, Guan Yu drove his knee into Wang Fubin’s nose. A sickening *crack* echoed—the sound of shattered cartilage.

Dragging Wang Fubin’s limp form, Guan Yu broke into a sprint toward an embedded aquarium decorating the nearby wall.

The hall’s walls, adorned with custom-built glass tanks, shimmered with aquatic life, creating an underwater illusion.

Without hesitation, Guan Yu heaved Wang Fubin’s head toward the aquarium.

*Crash!* The glass shattered. Wang Fubin’s skull plunged into the tank.

Water surged outward in a torrent, drenching his face as shards of glass lacerated his skin. Howling, Wang Fubin clutched his bleeding visage.

Undeterred, Guan Yu dragged him to another intact section of glass and slammed his head again.

*Snap!* More glass fractured. Soaked and bloodied, Wang Fubin resembled a crimson-soaked ragdoll, scarlet streams cascading from his forehead and cheeks.

Marching along the wall, Guan Yu pummeled him relentlessly. Flesh split, wounds multiplied, blood gushing like fountains.

Finally, Guan Yu hurled Wang Fubin to the floor. Glowering at the cowering figure, he growled, “Do you fucking know why I’m beating you?”

“Y-yes… yes…” Wang Fubin stammered.

The stunned crowd shifted their gaze to Feng Xin. A balding man sidled up to her, whispering, “Boss, is this kid here to wreck the place? Look at the mess he’s made!”

One shattered aquarium had flooded the carpet. Repairs would cost time and business.

Feng Xin nibbled her lip, studying Guan Yu. “Let him vent. I’ll settle things later.” A sly smile curled her mouth.

“You *know*? Then you deserve this!” Guan Yu whirled, sprinted to the entrance, and hoisted a massive potted evergreen—its trunk thick as a man’s arm, the ceramic base weighing over two hundred pounds.

Swinging it like a battle-axe, he charged at Wang Fubin, the pot arcing toward his ribs. A direct hit would shatter bones—or kill.

Crouched on the floor, Wang Fubin peeked through bloodied eyes. Though battered, his mind remained sharp.

**Chapter Sixty-Two: Smashing with Fists?**

Terror surged as the pot hurtled downward. Summoning desperate strength, Wang Fubin shoved himself aside, rolling like a tumbleweed.

*Boom!* The pot smashed empty floor. Guan Yu frowned, pivoted, and pursued.

Scrambling on all fours, Wang Fubin’s eyes bulged. *He’s trying to kill me!* Playing dead was futile now.

*Does this lunatic not fear the law?* Yet survival instincts overrode thought. He scrambled toward a restroom in the corner, bolting inside and slamming the door.

Panting, he stared at his reflection—a grotesque mask of blood. *Useless friends! All beaten by one guy!*

Fumbling for his phone, he dialed Zhao Xu downstairs. *This is the Fire Gang’s turf. A single shout will bring an army!*

Outside, Guan Yu yanked the locked door. “Come out!” he barked.

Safe for now, Wang Fubin sneered, “Screw you! Just wait—I’ll have your head!” The phone rang unanswered.

Guan Yu analyzed the door’s structure: thick frosted glass bricks, nearly three inches thick. Even a sledgehammer would struggle.

*Letting him off is too merciful.*

“Boss, should we stop him?” the balding man asked Feng Xin.

“No. Watch.” Her eyes sparkled with intrigue.

Finding no tools, Guan Yu stepped back, then charged, elbow-first, into the door.

*Clang!* The glass held.

Inside, Wang Fibiin jumped, then chuckled. “Idiot! Punching glass? Knock yourself out!”

Undaunted, Guan Yu hammered the door rhythmically. Hairline cracks spiderwebbed under his strikes. Pain flared in his elbow, but healing energy soothed it.

On the final charge, Guan Yu wound his fist, channeling gravitational force into a devastating punch.

*Crack!* His hand burst through, seizing Wang Fubin’s neck. He yanked the man’s head through the shattered pane.

“Boss… he’s insane!” the balding man muttered.

Feng Xin licked her lips, amused.

Blood dripped from Guan Yu’s knuckles as he hauled Wang Fubin out. A thunderous slap rocked the man’s face.

“Run again? Talk tough now?” Fists rained down, pulping flesh. Blood misted the air.

Wang Fubin’s eyes swelled shut. He hung limp, barely breathing.

**Chapter Sixty-Three: Martial Arts Manual?**

Spectators winced. “Boss, he’ll kill him!”

Feng Xin rose, sauntering over. “Enough. Unless you want a murder charge.”

Guan Yu paused. Though brutal, he’d avoided fatal blows—leaving room for healing.

With a snort, he tossed Wang Fubin’s mangled head back through the glass. The man’s half-lidded eyes tracked Guan Yu’s exit.

“Stay,” Feng Xin ordered. “Cops are coming.” She gestured to her men. “Take him upstairs.”

In her office, Guan Yu scanned bookshelves lined with scholarly tomes. A thread-bound, blue-covered manual caught his eye—an antique rarity.

Curiosity won. He pulled it free. Inside, crude ink sketches depicted stick figures in poses.

Flipping pages, Guan Yu snorted. *A child’s doodles.* Yet when fanned quickly, the figures seemed to move—a fluid sequence.

*Martial arts manual?* He mimicked a stance, then threw a punch.

*Crack!* His fist hit the shelf. A hidden compartment snapped open.
