“Miss Gao, as this is our first collaboration, please feel free to state any requests. We’ll do our utmost to accommodate them.” Feng Minglun maintained his courteous demeanor, still clasping Gao Wei’s hand.

“Moreover, someone as radiant as Miss Gao is perfectly suited to represent our product. If possible, I hope to deepen our collaboration.”

Feng Minglun tightened his grip slightly, his gaze brimming with affected tenderness.

A flicker of displeasure crossed Gao Wei’s face as she tried to withdraw her hand, but he feigned obliviousness, refusing to release her.

As Dior’s Greater China CEO, Feng Minglun wielded immense influence in the multinational corporation. A long-term partnership with him could significantly boost Gao Wei’s career. Yet she found his flirtatious behavior increasingly intolerable, skirting the edges of her boundaries.

While Gao Wei simmered, her assistant Xu Feng radiated excitement. Beaming at Feng Minglun, she interjected, “President Feng, here’s to a fruitful collaboration!”

Feng Minglun spared Xu Feng only a cursory glance. “Future collaborations depend entirely on Miss Gao’s willingness.”

The subtext hung heavy – acceptance would demand more than professional commitment, a truth all present understood. Refusal meant termination after this single project.

Xu Feng’s smile faltered momentarily before she recovered. “Weiwei’s an artist – of course she’s willing!”

“Sister Xu, you presume to speak for me?” Gao Wei’s irritation surfaced. As a seasoned industry player, Xu Feng couldn’t possibly misunderstand Feng’s implications. Her deliberate obtuseness and overreach were unacceptable.

Guan Yu observed the awkward standoff before stepping forward. “President Feng, your reputation precedes you. The reality doesn’t disappoint.”

Seizing Feng’s wandering wrist, Guan Yu applied calculated pressure. A muffled groan escaped Feng as Gao Wei finally reclaimed her hand.

Maintaining his grip, Guan Yu enthused, “Visionaries like you are rare role models for our generation!”

His trembling hand – from excessive force – lent credence to the feigned admiration.

Initially flattered by the praise earned through his self-made success, Feng’s pride soon curdled into agony. His face cycled through shades of discomfort before settling on ashen pallor, sweat beading his forehead.

Multiple escape attempts proved futile against Guan Yu’s vise-like grip. Prioritizing dignity over pain, Feng endured silently until released.

Guan Yu relinquished his hold before suspicions could arise. Feng’s purpling hand vanished into his jacket as he retreated, shooting Guan Yu a venomous glare.

Watching the retreating figure, Guan Yu smirked.

Gao Wei, no fool, murmured gratitude: “Thank you.”

“A shield should know its purpose. Just honor our agreement later.” Guan Yu shrugged lazily.

Blushing, Gao Wei glared. She’d never consented to his proposed “reward” – the man’s single-mindedness exasperated her.

Xu Feng scowled at Guan Yu. “Your petty antics could ruin Weiwei’s career. Don’t repeat this.”

“Whose career? Yours?” Guan Yu sneered. “With your fading charms, maybe our lustful president might fancy you. Secure your own prospects.”

His gaze sharpened. “It’s I who should warn you – cross me, and I’ll bury your ambitions first.”

Xu Feng recoiled, swallowing retorts. “Weiwei, I’ll prepare for the next agenda,” she forced out before fleeing.

“You should request a new agent,” Guan Yu advised Gao Wei, watching Xu Feng depart.

Sighing, Gao Wei contemplated the shattered illusion of her longtime collaborator.

“Weiwei! You’re finally here.” Bo Jie’s voice interrupted. Spotting Guan Yu, his smile stiffened. “You came too?”

“Spare me your idiocy,” Guan Yu dismissed.

Bo Jie’s smirk returned. “No matter. As my rival, I’ll prove through actions that I’m Weiwei’s true match.”

Chest puffed with unwarranted confidence, Bo Jie strutted off to finalize his grand romantic scheme – a public confession orchestrated by none other than Feng Minglun.

Bo Jie’s bravado stemmed from meticulous planning. Whether Gao Wei accepted or rejected his rose-petal descent proposal, media frenzy guaranteed his ascendance.

Guan Yu’s reconnaissance revealed Feng’s puzzling involvement. Why assist a romantic rival? The paradox nagged, but immediate concerns took precedence.

Memories surfaced – Gao Wei’s unwavering support during his darkest hour, her career nearly destroyed for his sake. This loyalty demanded reciprocation.

“Guan Yu!” Gao Wei’s impatient call shook him from reverie.

“We’ve lingered too long. Inside,” she urged, steering her companion Du Xiaojuan past prying cameras.

The venue throbbed with anticipation. Gao Wei’s transformation stunned – ivory gown accentuating curves, artful décolletage arresting breaths. Even Guan Yu momentarily lost composure.

Bo Jie’s competent vocal performance surprised, but the true spectacle unfolded post-Gao Wei’s ethereal rendition.

Gasps erupted as crimson rose formations descended. Suspended within the floral heart, a silhouetted figure captured all lenses.

“Who is that?” Du Xiaojuan squinted at the descending figure.

The mystery man’s identity mattered less than his guaranteed viral fame. Cameras clicked furiously, capturing every inch of the aerial proposal.

Guan Yu’s predicament amused the gods – his improvised sabotage (knocking out Bo Jie and hijacking the stunt) now backfired spectacularly.

Gao Wei stood transfixed, recognizing her faux-suitor despite sunglasses. Her heartbeat accelerated, cheeks flushing. Was this earnest affection? How to respond?

As petals rained, Guan Yu’s internal lament drowned in crowd roars. The stage now his, consequences be damned – this “shield” would defend to the last.
