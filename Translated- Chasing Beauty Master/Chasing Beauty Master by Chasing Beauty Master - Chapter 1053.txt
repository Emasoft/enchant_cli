Tonight marked the opening of the Ma family's first large-scale casino in City A. This establishment was extraordinary—a fully legal operation, maintained through substantial annual payments to the authorities.

The higher-ups turned a blind eye to the Ma family's methods, lured by the steady flow of money. As long as incidents were contained by the Ma family themselves and the bribes kept coming, the authorities were content to let them operate. Such convenient arrangements were always welcomed.

Fang Su leaned forward, proposing, "The Ma family’s grand casino opens tonight, undoubtedly filled with dignitaries. Why don’t we..." He outlined a scheme to Bill Lin, who chuckled approvingly and pointed at Fang Su. “You’re truly devious! This plan is excellent. Once executed, it’ll pull the Ma family onto our side for good.”

Fang Su stood with a grin. “Why wait? Let’s visit the casino now. What do you think?”

“Splendid,” Bill Lin replied, eyes glinting. “We’ll give them a show to remember. And since we’re at a casino...” He smirked. “I’ll cover your expenses tonight. Consider it my treat.”

“Many thanks, Young Master Bill. Your generosity is unmatched.” Fang Su bowed with exaggerated courtesy.

“Think nothing of it!” Bill Lin laughed heartily.

The pair arrived at the Ma family’s new casino with fanfare. At the entrance stood Ma Tong, the family patriarch—a forty-something man with a crew cut, square jaw, and thick lips. Dressed in a white shirt and black slacks, he greeted VIPs alongside his latest wife, a stunning young woman. Ma Tong’s habit of frequently replacing spouses was well-known; while not overtly promiscuous, he cycled through partners with peculiar dedication, never overlapping relationships.

Despite his thriving empire, Ma Tong harbored a private anguish: a congenital condition left him childless. Years ago, he adopted a daughter, now groomed as his heir—though whispers suggested she was being raised for more dubious purposes.

Bill Lin and Fang Su approached. Ma Tong, though unfamiliar with the Bill family heir, had extended an invitation to the Feng family. When Young Master Feng cited illness and sent Bill Lin as his proxy, Ma Tong seized the chance to curry favor. Fang Su, representing his own family, tagged along.

“Young Master Bill! Your presence honors us!” Ma Tong effused, eyeing the duo. “And Young Master Fang—I didn’t realize you were acquainted!”

“My father sends his regrets,” Fang Su said, handing a gift card to the woman beside Ma Tong. His gaze lingered on her plunging neckline, nearly spilling “rabbits” into view.

Bill Lin followed suit, discreetly assessing the wife. Her plain face contrasted with an hourglass figure—a matter of taste, he mused. The cards, preloaded with funds, were modern substitutes for traditional gifts.

“A bold venture, Ma Tong,” Bill Lin remarked. “And this must be your wife? A vision indeed.” His polished flattery masked disdain.

Ma Tong beamed. “You’re too kind! Let’s adjourn to my office.” He led them past the bustling casino floors—converted from a rented hotel—where guests traded chips not for cash, but digital credits. A loophole ensuring deniability: no physical money, no legal grip.

The office dazzled with opulence. A wine rack brimming with vintages dominated one wall. “Try this ’82 classic,” Ma Tong urged his wife, who uncorked it with practiced ease.

Bill Lin admired the collection. “A connoisseur, I see.”

“A mere hobby.” Ma Tong poured three glasses, ignoring Fang Su, who lingered by the wine rack—and the wife. Her crimson cheongsam, slit to the hip, captivated him. As she bent over the bottle, Fang Su edged closer, emboldened by her coy smile.

“Care to tour the collection?” Fang Su asked, maneuvering to block Ma Tong’s view. His hand darted to her thigh. She gasped.

“What’s wrong?” Ma Tong called.

“Nothing—just a twisted finger,” she lied, shooting Fang Su a knowing look.

Chaos erupted downstairs. Twenty thugs stormed the lobby, smashing everything in sight. “We’re from Yu Gang!” their leader roared. “No one trespasses on our turf!” Patrons—spoiled heirs and socialites—scrambled as the mob surged upstairs.

The assistant manager confronted them. “You dare challenge the Ma family?”

“Yu Gang doesn’t fear anyone! Especially not your money-grubbing boss!” The thugs charged, invoking the name of Guan Yu, Yu Gang’s ruthless leader. Reputation preceded them: cross Guan Yu, and retribution was guaranteed.

Above, the clink of glasses continued, oblivious to the carnage below.
