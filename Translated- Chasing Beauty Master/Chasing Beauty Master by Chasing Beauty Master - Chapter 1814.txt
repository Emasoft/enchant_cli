“Guan Yu, I should return this Blood Sword to you. It feels too precious for me to keep.” Du Bingyan (Ice Swallow) stepped forward and spoke earnestly.

Xiao Zhi nearly leapt out of his skin upon hearing this. Though boiling with anxiety, he restrained himself—too many elders were present to make a scene. *Has Little Yan lost her mind?* he fumed inwardly. *Guan Yu practically showers treasures! To refuse such a gift is madness! If he offers, grab it! Opportunities like this don’t come twice!*

Guan Yu chuckled warmly. “This is my wedding gift. Taking it back would shame me. Don’t wound my pride, now.”

“Exactly! Accept it, Little Yan!” Xiao Zhi blurted, barely containing his urgency. “It’s his heartfelt wish!”

Siqi added, “No need for modesty. Though valuable, the Blood Sword suits you perfectly. Wielding it feels…destined.”

Du Bingyan nodded reluctantly. The blade *had* felt unnervingly natural in her grip, despite its weight. As a novice to weapons, its heft—crafted entirely of dense metal, three fingers wide at the hilt—would require adjustment. Yet its balance tapered elegantly toward the tip, promising lethal grace once mastered.

Elder Ba resumed his seat, stroking his beard. “This Blood Sword’s history spans five centuries. Forged by the Blood Wing Patriarch through his dying breaths after creating the Blood Wing Art, it’s a weapon steeped in infamy—a relic of slaughter.”

“Yet its peril may be neutralized,” Elder Jiu countered. “Bingyan channels inner energy, not spiritual power. The blade’s true danger lies in the scabbard’s spirit-storing gem, which houses demonic energy. Since she lacks spiritual attunement, the corruption cannot touch her.”

Elder Ba inclined his head. “True. After its forging, this blade shook the martial world. During a clash between righteous and demonic factions, the Patriarch alone repelled an entire orthodox assault with it.”

“Aye,” Elder Qi interjected, eyes alight. “That battle remains etched in memory—how the Patriarch dominated! Yet even he fell gravely wounded, proving our righteous might.”

Elder Xuanming shot a sidelong glare at Elder Lu. “Later, the sword passed to the Black Blood Ridge’s Blood Lord, then faded into obscurity. Who’d have guessed you hoarded it, you old miser?”

Elder Lu stood rigid, silently mourning his lost treasure. Guan Yu marveled at the blade’s crimson metal—what alloy could achieve such a hue?

“Little Yan!” Xiao Zhi urged. “Thank him properly!”

Flushing, Du Bingyan bowed. “Thank you, Guan Yu.” She surrendered to delight—the sword *was* exquisite, its weight and balance tailored as if for her alone.

Guan Yu grinned. “Never had such struggle gifting before! Elder Zheng, the scabbard’s demonic energy—would you purify it? Ensure her safety.”

“Gladly,” Elder Zheng (Du Bingyan’s father-in-law) agreed, though the task would drain his spiritual reserves. For family, no cost was too great.

Elder Ba addressed Du Bingyan solemnly. “Though not formally a Yunqing Sect disciple, your marriage binds you to us. Your talent—self-taught Qi refinement—is rare. I’ve studied martial arts deeply. Visit me; my collection of lost techniques may aid your ascent.”

The family erupted in gratitude. Du Bingyan, stunned, knelt with Xiao Zhi, kowtowing as Elder Zheng and his wife Luo Jie bowed deeply. Elder Ba’s offer was unprecedented—his trove of forbidden manuals, guarded like life itself, now opened to an outsider. Even Sect Leader Xuanming had been denied access years prior.

Guan Yu mused that while Elder Ba’s archives couldn’t rival the Sword Immortal’s secrets, this mentorship would spare him tutoring duties. Meanwhile, he noted the three elders’ empty-handedness with disdain. *High status, yet stingy! Attending a wedding without gifts? Shameless!*

Unbeknownst to him, the elders had discreetly gifted Elder Zheng earlier. Their presence alone honored the occasion—a political boon outweighing material offerings.

As festivities waned, Guan Yu mingled, solidifying alliances. By midnight, most guests had departed. Siqi lingered reluctantly before leaving with her master.

Later, in Tiger Peak Hall, Sect Leader Xuanming assigned Guan Yu a critical mission: “Investigate the Eight-Drum Art’s emergence in the capital. We cannot let the Demonic Soul Sect seize it.”

Guan Yu nodded. “I’ll depart in two days. Alone—greater mobility. If needed, I’ll request aid from Prince Zou.”

Xuanming grimaced but acquiesced. Alliances with royalty risked scandal, yet the prince’s influence in the capital was indispensable.

Returning to his quarters, Guan Yu packed, anticipation simmering. With two Eight-Drum scrolls already secured, a third would edge him closer to unraveling the seal on his memories. He entered the Imperial Seal’s realm, where the artifact spirit greeted him testily: “Master! Absorbing that last scroll nearly shattered me! Warn me next time!”

Guan Yu surveyed the newly inscribed walls—golden symbols shimmering with latent power. “You instructed me to absorb it directly. Wasn’t that your advice?”

The spirit huffed, vanishing. Guan Yu smiled. Challenges awaited, but each step forward illuminated the path to his destiny.
