Such an endeavor naturally involved Wang Xiaorong, and of course Qiqi couldn’t be left out. Though aware the creature’s body might carry toxins, exercising caution would likely prevent any harm.

At the edge of the black abyss, a long hemp rope was tossed downward—prepared earlier by Guan Yu. A wooden stake had been driven into the ground beside the pitch-dark entrance, securing the rope in place.

While Guan Yu, Wang Xiaorong, and others could fly down, the ordinary soldiers had no choice but to descend slowly via the rope.

This time, under the centurion’s leadership, Guan Yu had specifically selected twenty bold soldiers. Though the abyss likely held no remaining dangers, its oppressive darkness demanded courage. Those faint of heart would falter—hence the need for stalwart men.

After descending, Guan Yu instructed, “First, five of you light torches. Let me assess the brightness.”

Though each soldier carried two or three torches, these were reserved for locating the beast and illuminating the return journey. For now, minimal light sufficed—just enough to navigate.

Following Guan Yu’s orders, the soldiers formed a line, lighting one torch every five men. Satisfied with the illumination, Guan Yu nodded. “Good. Stay behind me. Report anything unusual immediately.”

Wang Xiaorong and Qiqi walked hand in hand, seasoned to such ventures. Guan Yu led the way, followed by the two women and the twenty soldiers.

***Chapter 5082: A Stark Difference***

The group marched in formation, swiftly reaching the site where the beast had been slain. By then, the torches still flickered weakly but held enough flame.

With ample light, Guan Yu finally noticed the corpses of blood-sucking bats littering the ground. Now he understood the severity of Jiang Yuankai’s wounds and the nature of the poison.

The sheer number of bats made even Guan Yu gasp—countless bodies piled densely, a sight that prickled the scalp.

He murmured, “So Jiang Yuankai fought a bitter battle here against these bats before the beast ambushed him. No wonder his injuries were so grave.”

Though dead, the bats’ toxic nature lingered. Stagnant air trapped the miasma of their decaying bodies—prolonged exposure risked poisoning.

Mindful of this, Guan Yu urged haste. “For everyone’s safety, should we drag the carcass to the abyss entrance for disposal or handle it here?”

“Drag it?” Wang Xiaorong rolled her eyes, covering her mouth. “Disgusting as this place is, that beast’s corpse—ten meters long with a crushed skull—isn’t light. Even twenty men would struggle to move it.”

Guan Yu conceded. Time was critical. “Everyone, keep one torch and light the rest!”

The abyss blazed with torchlight. Though chosen for bravery, the soldiers paled at the sea of bat corpses and blood underfoot. Thankfully, the creatures were dead—else escape would’ve been impossible.

The longer they lingered, the higher the risk. Under Guan Yu’s direction, the twenty men set to dissecting the beast.

Only its belly bore hardened scales, and its front claws—metallic in toughness. The rest of its hide was merely coarse.

When Wang Xiaorong spotted the crimson tendons during the butchery, she exclaimed, “Treasure! Be careful—don’t damage them!”

Guan Yu knew such red beast tendons were priceless rarities. On the martial market, they were beyond wealth—unobtainable regardless of coin.

Beast tendons varied greatly in quality. The lowest—common ox tendons—were cheap and plentiful.

Tendons served many purposes: wrapping sword and saber hilts for grip, replacing rope (sturdier and elastic), crafting armor (high-grade tendons rendered it near-impenetrable), and making noble-grade bows. Superior bows—owned by aristocrats and royalty—relied on such tendons.

Tendon quality was judged by elasticity and color. From lowest to highest: earthen, golden, purple, and red. Red tendons were vanishingly rare, as only immensely powerful, cunning beasts possessed them—creatures nearly impossible to slay.

Even purple tendons were treasures. The emperor’s personal bow, the realm’s most prized, used red tendons. No other such bow existed.

Crafted by a Western master, its body fused precious gems and metal—a peerless artifact, unmatched in craftsmanship.

***Chapter 5083: Consolation***

At Wang Xiaorong’s cry, Guan Yu inspected the red tendons. “A true prize. This venture wasn’t in vain—I’ve slain a creature worth cities.”

The beast’s speed stemmed from its unique bones and tendons, but red tendons were an unexpected boon.

Though elastic, the tendons felt rigid. Guan Yu envisioned their potential in crossbows—enhancing projectile force.

After hours of labor, the beast’s bones were separated. Beyond the tendons and metallic claws, no other treasures were found.

“Gather everything. Carry the heavier pieces in pairs. We return now,” Guan Yu ordered.

Familiarity dulled the soldiers’ fear. They collected the bones and retraced their path.

Upon returning, they found Jiang Yuankai conscious. Guan Yu hurried to his tent without rest.

“Brother Jiang, how do you feel? Any discomfort?” Guan Yu asked.

Xiong Wu and others nodded respectfully before exiting. Pale and weak, Jiang Yuankai rasped, “I’ve been better… but thank you for saving me.”

“No need for formalities between us. Saving you was natural.” Guan Yu paused. “The bat venom was potent. Had I not shielded your heart meridian…”

“I know. Merely surviving is enough.” Jiang Yuankai sighed.

Clearly, he’d realized his Dantian’s damage—no internal energy could coalesce. Without healing, he’d remain crippled.

“Brother Jiang, life itself holds purpose. Even if all else is lost, survival is victory.” Guan Yu feared Jiang Yuankai might despair. “Princess Chang and Lady Jiang Xin await you. Perhaps return to the capital to see them.”

He hoped familial bonds would anchor Jiang Yuankai’s will.

Jiang Yuankai smiled wryly. “Wan Hong, spare the comfort. I’m not fragile. I’m grateful to be alive. I’ll return home regardless of my state.”

Guan Yu nodded. “Your clarity eases my heart. Remember—your family will never forsake you.”

Though Jiang Yuankai might face ridicule as a fallen master, indifference to scorn would shield him.

“We embarked for the East Sea. I’ll see this through—even in a carriage,” Jiang Yuankai declared.

“Then I’ll accompany you to the end,” Guan Yu vowed.

Jiang Yuankai’s resolve stemmed from the East Sea Dragon Pearl—a treasure worth empires. Even crippled, safeguarding it was paramount. Wealth could secure his dignity.

“As long as you don’t deem me a burden,” Jiang Yuankai said.

“Never. Brothers stick together—even if you must lie abed all journey,” Guan Yu affirmed.

***Chapter 5084: Strong Bonds***

After two days’ rest, Jiang Yuankai improved. Guan Yu’s spiritual energy treatments had healed his organs and partially mended his Dantian. Full recovery remained uncertain, but Jiang Yuankai’s optimism held.

He’d written to Princess Chang and prepared to continue by carriage. The centurion provided a spacious one, shared with Duan Ruxue.

Half a day’s travel brought them to Twinflow City—bisected by a river. Legend held its name originated from a village where women predominantly bore twin sons, rarely daughters.
