“What’s the use of your anger at me? The message from their side says exactly that—do you think I’d feed you false information? If you’re so capable, go challenge Guan Yu yourself!” Young Master Feng retorted furiously.

Young Master Feng was beginning to resent Luo Bo. For someone hailed as a top-tier expert, Luo Bo was overly cautious and ineffective. What was the point of spending so much money to keep these useless people around?

Young Master Feng had expected Luo Bo to bring back their captive and use him to extort money from Guan Yu. Instead, not only had they failed to retrieve the hostage, but Bill Lin was now venting his fury on him. The more Feng dwelled on it, the angrier he became.

Bill Lin cursed, “I can’t fathom your incompetence, Young Master Feng. You’re utterly useless—can’t even protect your own garment factory. What good are you?”

**Chapter 2960: This Must Be Done**

“Stop your damn whining!” Young Master Feng snapped. “Do you think I wanted the factory destroyed? If you’re so capable, go demand compensation from Guan Yu yourself. I’m done with this.” With that, he stormed upstairs, ignoring Bill Lin.

Poison Widow grew anxious. Luo Bo had failed to retrieve the hostage, and she didn’t know if Bill Lin would pay to ransom Xiang Jiamian. If Bill Lin refused, she’d have no choice but to confront Guan Yu directly.

“We can’t wait any longer,” Poison Widow declared, rising. “I fear something will happen to Xiang Jiamian. I must go check on him.”

Her words were pointedly aimed at Bill Lin. If he intended to pay the ransom, he’d speak up. If not, he wouldn’t stop her from confronting Guan Yu.

Bill Lin, seething, watched as Poison Widow stood to leave—only to be blocked by Luo Bo.

“You can’t go alone. It’s too dangerous,” Luo Bo warned.

Poison Widow met his gaze. “Xiang Jiamian has been my friend for years. He risked everything for me—I won’t abandon him like a coward.” Her voice sharpened, ensuring Bill Lin heard every word.

“Explain what happened. Why did Guan Yu capture Xiang Jiamian? Wasn’t he undercover?” Luo Bo pressed.

“Guan Yu discovered his identity while he was gathering intel at the factory. Look—this is the message Guan Yu sent.” Poison Widow handed her phone to Luo Bo.

Luo Bo scanned the ransom demand and the photo of Xiang Jiamian’s bloodied face. “A million dollars? You don’t have that kind of money. Going there now would be suicide. Guan Yu might capture you too.”

“I’ll fight Guan Yu if I must. For my friend, I’ll do this!” Poison Widow gritted her teeth.

Bill Lin saw an opportunity. “If we strike now while Guan Yu’s forces are scattered, we might succeed. Let’s gather our men and storm his location!”

Luo Bo agreed. “The sooner we act, the better. If we wait until the Wolf King returns, we’ll lose our chance.”

Poison Widow nodded. “Let’s go.”

As they left, Bill Lin watched them, suspicion gnawing at him. If Poison Widow and Luo Bo were conspiring, he’d need to separate them.

Bill Lin mobilized the Feng family’s forces, targeting the Flower Night Club. He knew it belonged to the Yang family, but desperate times called for desperate measures.

**Chapter 2961: I’ve Come to Save You**

The club was in shambles. Xiang Jiamian lay pale and bloodied on the floor, his leg mangled. Shen Sheng had stemmed the bleeding with internal energy, but time was running out.

Poison Widow stormed in, demanding, “Where is Xiang Jiamian?”

Guan Yu gestured toward the fallen man. “He’s here. A million dollars, and you can take him.”

“You’ve tortured him beyond recognition!” Luo Bo roared.

Poison Widow knelt beside Xiang Jiamian. “Hang on—I’m here to save you.”

Xiang Jiamian forced a weak smile. “I knew… you’d come…” before slipping into unconsciousness.

“Pay up, or he dies,” Guan Yu said coldly.

“Bill Lin won’t pay. You’re on your own,” Guan宇 taunted, stoking her resentment.

Poison Widow glared. “What’s your price?”

“A million’s non-negotiable. But perhaps…” Guan Yu smirked, “we can bargain.”

**Chapter 2962: Bargaining**

“You want him? Let’s talk terms.” Guan Yu leaned back. “But remember—cross me, and you’ll answer to the Yang family.”

Poison Widow clenched her fists. “Name your price.”

“Let’s start with information. Bill Lin’s next move. Or… a favor.”

The standoff thickened as both sides weighed their options. Time ticked away, and Xiang Jiamian’s breaths grew shallower.
