“Officer Yu had no desire to risk his life over tonight’s events. The situation had spiraled beyond his control, and he remained motionless on the ground, indifferent to casualties. He’d wait until the fighting concluded before rising to assess the aftermath.

This was typical police behavior—cowering until the storm passed, only emerging when the danger had subsided.

‘You go first. Follow the back of this car and leave quickly,’ Guan Yu ordered Xue Jing in a commanding tone.

Though deeply concerned for his safety, Xue Jing dared not argue against his authoritative manner. She obeyed, swiftly moving along the rear of the police car to escape.

Seeing Xue Jing reach the relative safety of the opposite roadside, Guan Yu kept his gaze locked on the two assailants’ positions. Fortunately, neither had risen again.

One clutched a wounded shoulder, but the other hadn’t abandoned the assassination attempt. Crouching low, he inched toward the vehicle’s rear, attempting to scout Guan Yu’s location.

Guan Yu held the advantage, his gun trained on their direction. The moment a head appeared, his bullet would fly without hesitation.

These killers had opened fire immediately—ruthless professionals deserving no mercy. As the prolonged silence stretched, Guan Guan crouched lower, peering beneath the car to monitor their movements.

When he tilted his head down, he spotted two feet creeping toward the vehicle’s tail. The other assailant remained seated, clearly incapacitated by his shoulder wound.

Guan Yu aimed his barrel at the car’s rear, tracking the shifting feet. One glimpse of movement, and he’d fire.

Yet after moments of tense waiting, no figure emerged. Guan Yu frowned—perhaps they’d detected his vigilance and frozen.

He was right. The wounded assailant had stealthily produced a small mirror. As Guan Yu focused on the car’s rear, the man angled the mirror upward, spotting Guan Yu’s aimed weapon and urgently signaling his partner to halt.

Guan Yu couldn’t afford to linger. Xue Jing waited anxiously in the distance. The sudden roar of his Desert Eagle shattered the stillness, making Officer Yu smash his face into the pavement in terror, cold sweat drenching his uniform.

The gunshot reignited the crowd’s panic. This warning shot was Guan Yu’s message: stay down, or die.

He needed to escape before more police arrived. Though the assassins’ silenced pistols had muffled their shots, his unsuppressed firearm’s report would carry far. If caught armed at a shootout scene, explanations would prove futile.

The bullet from Guan Yu’s Desert Eagle embedded itself in the police car’s metal frame, unlike the weaker 9mm rounds that merely scratched the surface. The impact forced both assailants to duck, giving Guan Yu his chance to flee as distant sirens wailed.

Post-retreat, the killers also heard approaching patrols. Abandoning their mission, one helped his wounded comrade into their vehicle and sped off.

When police swarmed the scene, they found a bullet-riddled cruiser and bloodied bodies littering the ground. Paramedics already tended to casualties—two fatal hits, others wounded by ricochets, two men unconscious from sheer terror.

A patrolman’s shout startled the petrified Black Tank Top, who collapsed in a dead faint. The officer hastily raised his hands: ‘He fell on his own! You all saw—I didn’t touch him!’

Leading the investigative team was Captain Lin Qiaoqiao. She initially mistook the cowering officers for injured, only to find them unscathed yet paralyzed with fear.

‘Impressive act,’ Lin remarked dryly, observing their ‘corpse’ performance.

**Chapter 2739: No Regrets in Doing This**

With all others wounded, Lin questioned the unharmed officers. Officer Yu, reeking of urine, stammered his account: responding to a bar brawl report, apprehending a man and woman, then ambushed by gunmen.

‘They all fled?’ Lin demanded, gesturing at the casualties. ‘And these victims?’

‘Bystanders caught in crossfire,’ Yu lied, omitting their gang affiliations.

Lin’s gaze fell on Yu’s holstered weapon. ‘You let both sides escape without even drawing your gun? Just played dead?’

Though humiliated, Yu felt no regret—surviving the hail of bullets was victory enough.

**Chapter 2740: Incomplete Intelligence**

From a hidden vantage, Guan Yu and Xue Jing watched the investigation. ‘Who wants you dead this badly?’ Xue whispered.

‘Unknown,’ Guan Yu replied coldly. ‘But they’ve signed their death warrant.’ The attack endangered Xue Jing—an unforgivable line crossed.

As Xue suggested leaving, Guan Yu waited for intel—he’d sent Gambiri to tail the fleeing assassins.

Meanwhile, at the Fang residence, the Widow’s triumphant call turned to fury. ‘Failed? With guns at that range?’

Fang Su’s hope curdled to dismay. His aunt blamed him for withholding Guan Yu’s firearm intel, though Fang himself had forgotten the Desert Eagle from prior encounters.

Back at the crime scene, Officer Yu approached Lin with a lead: ‘The retaliating shooter—someone at the bar knows him.’

Lin pressed for details, unaware Guan Yu’s identity would soon surface. The night’s events were far from over—the Desert Eagle’s roar still echoed through the city’s shadowed alleys.
