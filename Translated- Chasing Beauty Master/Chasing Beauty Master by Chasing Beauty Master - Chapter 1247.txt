Guan Yu nodded. “Alright, Dr. Wang, you can head home after your shift. There’s nothing urgent here. Oh, by the way, can we order food here?”

It had just occurred to him that his aunt and the others hadn’t eaten anything yet. At the very least, they needed to get some food for his uncle, whose weakened condition would worsen without proper nourishment.

“Of course,” replied Wang Wu. “The nurse station has plenty of delivery flyers. Just call any of the numbers, place your order, and they’ll bring the food directly to the room. The hospital also has a cafeteria with digestible, nutritious options—though the taste isn’t as good as outside.”

After this explanation, Guan Yu realized another problem: his aunt didn’t own a cellphone. If he left, contacting her would be difficult, and he couldn’t keep relying on Wang Wu for updates.

Even if he bought her a phone now, she likely wouldn’t know how to use it, and no one would have the patience to teach her.

An idea struck him. “Dr. Wang, do you have a landline phone here? One that can be used in the patient’s room?”

Wang Wu found the request odd—landlines were practically obsolete—but he obliged. “Yes, I can bring the nurse station’s phone over. Give me a moment.” He hurried out and soon returned with a large cordless landline, placing it on the bedside table. “Here you go. Feel free to use it anytime.”

Guan Yu thanked him. “I appreciate your help, Dr. Wang.”

“No need for formalities. Here’s my card—call if you need anything.” Wang Wu left with a smile, his efficiency earning Guan Yu’s approval.

Guan Yu then taught his aunt how to use the landline. Though she’d never seen one before, she mastered it after two demonstrations. Handing her a takeout flyer, he realized another hurdle: she had no money to pay for meals.

He stepped out to call Wang Wu again. “Dr. Wang? Are you still here? I need another favor.”

“I’m in my office. What can I do for you?”

“My friends are from the mountains and aren’t familiar with… modern procedures. Could you ask the nurses to help them order meals? They’ll choose from the flyers, and the nurses can place the calls.”

“Consider it done. I’ll inform the head nurse immediately.”

Guan Yu pulled out a stack of cash. “Use this to cover the meals. Let me know when it runs out.”

Wang Wu, initially hoping for a bribe, hid his disappointment. “Of course. Let’s visit the head nurse together.”

After arrangements were made, the head nurse—a Ms. Wu—assured Guan Yu’s aunt, “Just pick what you want from the flyers, and we’ll handle the rest.”

The aunt, marveling at the convenience, eagerly selected two dishes from the glossy photos.

With the meal issue resolved, Guan Yu prepared to leave. His aunt refused any money, so he focused on final instructions. “Feed Uncle as soon as the food arrives. He needs strength.”

His younger cousin, Xiao Zhu, stubbornly insisted on staying, despite her mother’s protests.

The group later dined at a chain restaurant. Second Only to Wolf, ever pragmatic, suggested finding a hotel. “Let’s eat, rest, and travel tomorrow. There’s nowhere to sleep here.”

Guan Yu agreed, though he dreaded the sleeping arrangements. Lin Qiaoqiao would undoubtedly demand to share his room, leaving Siqi alone—a prospect that worried him.

True to form, Second Only to Wolf booked a lavish four-star hotel. At the front desk, the clerk eyed Guan Yu and his two female companions with thinly veiled disdain.

“How large are your premium suites?” Guan Yu asked pointedly, irked by her judgmental glance.

Flustered, the clerk stammered, “T-two deluxe rooms on the 22nd floor. Processing now.”

The suite solution came from Second Only to Wolf: “Get a豪华间 with separate bedrooms and a living room. You three can stay together without… complications.”

Guan Yu approved, though Siqi hesitated at the doorway. “This… isn’t proper. I could sleep outside—”

“Nonsense,” Guan Yu interrupted, gently pulling her inside. “You’ll have your own room. I’ll take the couch.”

Lin Qiaoqiao protested. “I’m sleeping on the couch too! It’s big enough!”

After futile arguments, Guan Yu relented, sharing a bedroom with her while Siqi retreated to hers, bewildered by the opulent surroundings.

The next morning, Siqi meditated quietly, savoring the soft bed—a far cry from her austere life at Hejian Peak. Lin Qiaoqiao, hungry and restless, roused Second Only to Wolf to fetch breakfast.

“The lobby has free breakfast!” he grumbled, half-asleep.

“Guan Yu wants it delivered!” she lied, shoving her foot to block his closing door.

Grudgingly, he agreed. As she waited smugly, the dynamic trio’s adventures continued—a blend of mundane logistics and unspoken tensions, all under the shadow of an ever-thickening plot.
