Thud… Jin Cheng directly knelt at Guan Yu’s feet: “Big brother, we were wrong! Spare us this time! We’ll never dare again—absolutely won’t cause you any more trouble, I swear!”

Jin Xing’s entire body convulsed as he stared with bloodshot eyes at his younger brother kneeling before Guan Yu. Gnashing his teeth, he spat out each word: “Get up! Have some dignity!”

“Fuck your dignity!” Niu Le beside Guan Yu took a running start and viciously kicked Jin Xing’s right leg with full force.

Crack! The brutal impact spun Jin Xing’s body 180 degrees across the ground, his right shinbone snapping audibly. With a choked gasp, Jin Xing immediately passed out from the pain.

Guan Yu looked down expressionlessly at the groveling Jin Cheng and nodded. “Fine. Since you’re kneeling, I’ll spare you this time. Remember—after you recover, I’ll still be waiting for your explanation.” His voice remained calm yet carried undeniable authority.

Strangely, while Guan Yu had wanted to tear apart these arrogant opponents moments earlier, seeing this grown man weeping at his feet extinguished his thirst for vengeance. Glancing at Jin Xing’s twitching form, Guan Yu pursed his lips and instructed Luo Cheng’s group: “Take these friends somewhere to unwind. I’ll join you later.”

Understanding perfectly, Luo Cheng nodded and cheerfully led his boisterous entourage down the sidewalk.

Guan Yu then turned to handle the remaining faction leaders. Despite Lin Xu, Xu Kai and others repeatedly declining, Guan Yu insisted on hosting a lavish banquet at a high-end hotel to express gratitude.

No one paid attention to the kneeling Jin Cheng or unconscious Jin Xing. The once-mighty “Big Brother Jin” now appeared pathetically desolate—face bandaged, kneeling before his brother while frantically calling an ambulance. Their remaining lackeys stood dejectedly nearby, utterly lost.

As the crowd dispersed, the specially summoned campus security director glared furiously from his office window. This brazen daylight gathering with openly displayed weapons far exceeded his worst expectations. “What background does this Guan Yu have?” he fumed. “Some mafia prince?”

Behind him, excited PE teachers chattered about Jin Cheng finally meeting his match. News quickly reached the university president, who rubbed his hands gleefully: “Excellent! Four years of peace secured! This Guan Yu—what a perfect recruit! Don’t interfere—let him develop naturally. Call Teacher Liu—we need to discuss replacing Jin Cheng’s position. That brat’s been getting increasingly out of hand!”

“Hmm… Guan Yu shouldn’t become too arrogant, right?” The president mused alone after dismissing the director. “No—with Teacher Liu (his sister) overseeing him, everything’s manageable!” Humming along to his computer’s music, the old man reveled in solved campus security issues.

Meanwhile, Guan Yu earnestly toasted each faction leader and their officers. Their spontaneous show of support had given him immense face—a debt he’d need to repay. Today’s spectacle ensured “Guan Yu” would become a household name across N City.

Chapter 258: If Big Sis Doesn’t Dote On You, Who Will?

After the banquet, Guan Yu personally escorted all leaders to their vehicles. Only Feng Xin remained, arms crossed and scowling.

“You made such a huge fuss over these two worthless punks?” she huffed. “Couldn’t you handle this quietly?”

Guan Yu scratched his nose awkwardly. “I never expected you to bring so many people…”

“So it’s my fault for caring?” Feng Xin turned away sharply.

“No! You know that’s not what I meant!” Guan Yu waved frantically.

When Feng Xin continued ignoring him, Guan Yu tentatively tugged her sleeve: “Xin-jie, I know you care deeply. I feel it every day.”

Feng Xin glanced sideways. “What—acting cute now?”

“Just… don’t be mad.” Guan Yu’s ears reddened.

“Hmph. Why should I care? I’m not your girlfriend.” The uncharacteristically tender pout didn’t match her usual tough demeanor.

As awkward silence fell, Feng Xin made to leave. Panicking, Guan Yu grabbed her wrist and pulled her close—their faces mere inches apart.

“Will… will you still care about me?” he blurted desperately.

Feng Xin stared before murmuring: “Silly… who else would this big sis dote on?” Her flushed cheeks betrayed the tough act.

Beaming, Guan Yu tucked stray hairs behind her ear. “Drive safe. Message me when home.”

“So naggy!” Feng Xin stomped away, scarlet to her earlobes. Her bewildered driver nearly got whiplash watching the notoriously fierce boss giggle and facepalm throughout the ride.

Chapter 259: Men of Honor, Clear Conscience

While Guan Yu celebrated with Luo Cheng’s crew, a very different scene unfolded at the hospital. Jin Xucheng nearly burst blood vessels berating Lei Di: “I entrusted my sons to you! Now one’s legs are broken and you escaped unharmed?”

Lei Di retorted coldly: “You said we were handling some student! Not the guy who mobilized N City’s entire underworld in broad daylight! Hundreds with automatic weapons! Should I have died for your arrogance?”

As Lei Di stormed out, Jin Xucheng finally grasped the situation. Provincial authorities soon pressured Chief Nie to crack down—creating a dilemma given Guan Yu’s connections.

Meanwhile, Old Liu received Nie’s call. “Hold action,” the retired commissioner ordered grimly. “I’ll handle this.”
