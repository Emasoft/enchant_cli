“What needs to be done now is to not lose track of these two people. We must follow them so that when the City Lord’s men arrive, we can easily capture them.”

The two Zhao brothers bent down to help Young Master Men up. “Quick, let’s get to the nearby pharmacy first to bandage your wounds. You’re losing too much blood!”

Young Master Men, now delirious from blood loss, could no longer focus on anything else. His mind was consumed by rage at his incompetent subordinate who had yet to return with reinforcements despite being sent out long ago.

The Zhao brothers, exemplifying brotherly loyalty, supported Young Master Men into the pharmacy. “Shopkeeper! Is there anyone here skilled in medicine? Hurry and tend to his wounds!”

“Good heavens! What happened?” The shopkeeper rushed out, exclaiming, “Lay him on the bed!” He swiftly fetched a medical kit, disinfected the wound, and applied a temporary bandage.

“Though we have medicine here,” the shopkeeper whispered, “this gentleman’s injury is deep. He’ll need proper treatment elsewhere. We can only manage a basic dressing.”

“It hurts! It hurts so much!” Young Master Men lay on the bed, his face pallid.

The shopkeeper suggested, “Such external wounds are bound to be painful. If it’s unbearable, I can fetch some hemp leaves for you to chew. They’ll dull the pain.” He turned to retrieve them.

Zhao the Second asked, “Brother Men, does your family have a physician? Should we take you home or find a doctor here?”

“I don’t want to move! Just bring a physician here. Hurry!” Young Master Men gritted through clenched teeth.

Zhao the Eldest declared, “I’ll go find a physician. Stay here with him.”

“Thank you, Brother Zhao. Please hurry!” Young Master Men managed. As Zhao the Eldest left, the shopkeeper returned with a dried black leaf.

“Young Master, chew this. Though bitter, it will ease your pain.”

Nodding vigorously, Young Master Men swallowed the leaf without hesitation. Any relief was worth the bitterness.

**Chapter 3452: Outrageous**

As the City Lord’s second son, he had never endured such suffering—this was a first, and utterly unbearable.

Suddenly, a crowd stormed into the pharmacy, startling the shopkeeper.

“Second Young Master! What happened?!” A subordinate knelt in shock upon seeing Young Master Men bloodied on the bed.

“Where have you been?!” Zhao the Second snapped. “The culprits are gone, and you arrive only now!” Despite the delay, Young Master Men felt some relief—at least his life was no longer in danger.

“The City Lord, concerned for your safety, is on his way,” the subordinate stammered.

Moments later, a shrewd-looking middle-aged man with a weaselly gaze and a thin mustache entered—the City Lord’s steward. Behind him strode the slightly portly City Lord Men himself.

Upon seeing his father, Young Master Men broke into loud sobs. “Father! It hurts! Avenge me!”

“My child! Who did this to you?!” Though usually composed, City Lord Men trembled at the sight of his son’s battered state.

Lost in pain, Young Master Men continued wailing—the hemp leaves proving ineffective.

Zhao the Second bowed. “Greetings, City Lord Men.”

The Zhao family was prominent in Qujiang City, and the City Lord recognized Zhao the Second, who often visited the manor.

“Why are you here? Explain this!” City Lord Men demanded, masking his anguish with authority.

Zhao the Second recounted, “We were drinking at Echo Pavilion when Young Master Men showed us a jade pendant. Upon leaving, Red Lotus Sect disciples accosted us, claiming the pendant as theirs. When denied, they attacked him, mocking even your authority.”

City Lord Men’s composure cracked. “So the Red Lotus Sect dares disrupt my city? This is my domain—they shall not run wild here!”

Though known as a benevolent ruler who attended to minor civic matters, City Lord Men now ordered his steward, “Mobilize all guards! Hunt down those Red Lotus Sect members!”

Determined, he added, “Recent reports suggest outsiders plotting chaos in Qujiang. The Red Lotus Sect is clearly involved. They must be apprehended to protect our people!”

Young Master Men felt a grim satisfaction—his father’s pretext would ensure the sect’s downfall.

The steward bowed. “At once, my lord.”

As guards carried Young Master Men away, the Zhao brothers departed. On the road, Zhao the Second mused, “Brother, will the City Lord truly challenge the Red Lotus Sect? They’re a major sect—clashing with them risks grave consequences.”

“He has no choice,” Zhao the Eldest reasoned. “His son was publicly brutalized. To maintain authority and paternal duty, he must act—even at great cost.”

**Chapter 3453: Evening Meal**

Meanwhile, Guan Yu meditated in his room, contemplating Zhiyu Wolf’s journey—likely nearing Mount Yunqing’s foothills by now.

His own cultivation progress remained stagnant, inner energy resisting control. Resolving to avoid conflict in Zhiyu Wolf’s absence, he was interrupted by Xiao Zhi’s shout:

“Guan Yu! Hiding all day? Did you get dumped? Come eat!”

Emerging hungry, Guan Yu teased, “Out gallivanting again? Heard any news?”

“Let me tell it!” Aze cut in. “At a tavern, we heard Red Lotus disciples Yue Jing and Lai Lixia crippled Young Master Men over a jade pendant!”

“Predictable,” Guan Yu shrugged. Having planted the jade on Men, he’d anticipated this.

Xiao Zhi grinned. “The City Lord’s enraged—ordered a manhunt under the guise of quelling unrest. The sect’s in deep trouble!”

Guan Yu smiled faintly—all proceeded as planned.

“Aren’t you pleased?” Xiao Zhi pressed. “The City Lord handles our Red Lotus problem!”

“They’re no allies,” Guan Yu scoffed. “Calling themselves righteous? They’re worse than demons. Attacking a civilian over trinkets—disgraceful.”

Aze nodded. “Even cultivators shouldn’t brutalize ordinary folk. No wonder the City Lord acts.”

As dinner was announced, they headed to the hall. Guan Yu noted Steward Sun’s silent approach—evidence of cultivation.

“Is Steward Sun a cultivator?” he whispered.

“Dunno,” Xiao Zhi shrugged. “Uncle’s steward must be capable.”

Approaching the dining hall, Aze asked about Xiao Zhi’s cousin, Qin Taijin—the eldest son due home that evening.

“They’re waiting for him to dine,” Guan Yu observed the lavish spread.

“He’s Qujiang’s top bachelor,” Xiao Zhi boasted. “Handsome, wealthy—women flock to him!”

Guan Yu chuckled. “Hope he lives up to the hype.”

**Chapter 3454: Delaying Important Matters**

Mid-meal, Aze asked, “What’s Qin Taijin like?”

“Rumor says he’s exceptional,” Xiao Zhi said, gnawing a chicken wing. “But I’ve not seen him in a decade.”

Guan Yu smirked. “Rich heir, probably arrogant. But we’ll see.”

As they ate, Steward Sun reappeared. “Young Masters, dinner is served.”

Noticing the absent family, Xiao Zhi asked, “Where’s Aunt?”

“Awaiting Young Master Qin’s return,” Steward Sun replied. “They’ll dine together later.”

The trio dug into the extravagant feast—a display of wealth meant to impress. Between bites, they pondered Qin Taijin’s imminent arrival and Guan Yu’s lingering suspicions about Steward Sun.

Yet for now, the clatter of dishes and murmured speculations filled the hall—a brief respite before looming storms.
