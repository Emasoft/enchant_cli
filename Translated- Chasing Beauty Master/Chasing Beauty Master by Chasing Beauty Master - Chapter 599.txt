“While the two were talking, a sudden ‘boom’ resounded as one of the blue light waves violently exploded, followed by cheers erupting from the crowd. Guan Yu turned to look and spotted a tall young man standing triumphantly before a magic box amidst the throng—none other than Hu Xiaohai, who had recently recovered from severe injuries.

After being wounded by Guan Yu last time, Hu Xiaohai had initially kept a low profile, but this restraint lasted only a few days before he reverted to his former domineering self. Under the crowd’s watchful eyes, Hu Xiaohai laughed heartily, then reached out to open the magic box. A dazzling blue light flashed, revealing a thick magic scroll hovering above it.

Upon obtaining the scroll, Hu Xiaohai glanced back and inadvertently met Guan Yu’s gaze. He quickly averted his eyes, while Guan Yu responded with a cold smirk, his expression unreadable.

“Senior Brother Hu is truly remarkable, opening the magic box with such ease!” a short disciple fawned. Hu Xiaohai, however, shot him a fierce glare instead of acknowledging the praise, then turned and strode away.

“Brother Guan Yu, let’s leave. Staying here is so dull!”

Guan Yu checked the time—still half an hour remaining. He nodded. “My intuition tells me deeper inside lie even more powerful magic scrolls, though the dangers multiply. Will you still accompany me?”

Huo Lingling’s eyes sparkled as she affirmed, “Brother Guan Yu, no matter the peril, I’ll stay by your side!”

Though Guan Yu remained silent at her overt declaration, his heart understood. As they walked and chatted, a violet glow flickered at the path’s end.

Spotting it, Guan Yu quickened his pace toward the radiance. Disciples nearby widened their eyes in awe, well aware of the purple light’s significance.

Many coveted the violet light wave, yet none possessed the strength to breach it despite exhausting their methods. Undeterred, they lingered with hopeful curiosity, eager to witness who might finally shatter it.

Hidden within that glow was a Mysterious Rank magic scroll—its tier, whether low or high, remained uncertain.

Huo Lingling, puzzled by Guan Yu’s swift discovery, asked, “Brother Guan Yu, how did you locate a Mysterious Rank skill so quickly? Did my father share some secret?”

Guan Yu chuckled conspiratorially, leaning close to whisper, “You clever little imp! With such wits, who’d dare marry you someday?”

**Chapter 1519: Violet Light Wave**

Onlookers wore varied expressions upon witnessing Guan Yu and Huo Lingling’s intimacy—most envious, some entranced by Huo Lingling’s exquisite beauty, even halting their attacks on the light wave.

Guan Yu flicked her nose teasingly. “Little vixen, causing commotions wherever you go! If this continues, I’ll have to leave you behind!”

Huo Lingling stuck out her tongue playfully. “It’s not my fault! But if it bothers you, I’ll wear a veil next time.”

“Tch.” Guan Yu rolled his eyes before sobering. “Stand aside. I’ll attempt to break this swiftly.”

A solemn aura enveloped him. Sensing his focus, Huo Lingling stepped back.

Guan Yu’s eyes snapped open as he roared, “**Break!**” A violent gust erupted from his palm, streaking like lightning toward the violet glow.

The collision of energies vibrated the air, producing a deafening hum. Drawn by the noise, disciples surged forward to witness the spectacle.

A thunderous crack echoed as the stubborn violet barrier shattered like glass. A burst of purple light flared before subsiding into calm.

The crowd erupted in applause—a mix of envy and genuine admiration.

Huo Lingling flushed with excitement, her fervor for Guan Yu’s triumphs unwavering. He long ago grew accustomed to her reactions.

Recalling Wang Xiao’s planned departure, Guan Yu wondered if Hu Xiaohai’s visit would be in vain. “Father mentioned traveling. If he’s absent, your trip would be wasted. Visit another day—he often frequents your stall. We’ll come together then.”

Disappointment flashed across Hu Xiaohai’s face. “Very well. Since Benefactor Wang is away, I’ll trouble you no further. However, I’ll return a thousand of the three thousand gold coins you gave me. One thousand is my rightful share; the rest belong to my men.”

Stunned by the offer, Guan Yu recognized Hu Xiaohai’s attempt to repay his father’s lifesaving debt. “This shames me! My father saved you, not I. Repay him directly. I refuse to bask in his glory—I’ll surpass him!”

Hu Xiaohai faltered. “I merely…”

“Enough. Insist on returning the coins, and I’ll decline the parchment.”

Chagrined, Hu Xiaohai relented. “My oversight. Forgive me. Your resolve honors you.”

Guan Yu’s regard for Hu Xiaohai deepened—here was a man worthy of trust.

Bikamao’s voice interrupted: “Boy, hurry back! Prepare for the potion.”

Taking leave, Guan Yu headed home. Finding Wang Xiao’s room dark, he murmured, “Gone, as I thought.”

**Chapter 1520: Fury of the Berserker**

Bikamao’s order snapped Guan Yu to attention. Producing the Thunder-devouring Beast’s core, a Heaven Spirit Herb, and a Demon Spirit Herb, he stripped to his undergarments under the dragon’s exasperated roar.

Bikamao enveloped him and the ingredients in magical barriers. The materials melted, their violent energies tamed by the herbs’ essence before merging into Guan Yu’s body.

Agony seared his flesh as energies surged toward his heart, igniting his bloodstream. Flames and lightning wreathed his form. “Bikamao! I’m burning!”

The dragon chuckled. “Hush! Soundproofed the barrier. Endure—this pain forges true strength!”

Clenching his jaw, Guan Yu’s resolve hardened.

**Chapter 1521: Altai**

Elder Altai’s voice rasped from the podium: “Wang Chao, curb your arrogance! Your grandfather fell to me!”

Wang Chao sneered. “Ancient history! The Wang Clan rules now. Unless… Guan Yu fears to fight?”

“Who said I refuse?”

Silence gripped the arena.

Huo Lingling clasped her hands. *He’ll protect me.*

Wang Chao lunged without warning, fist crackling with energy. Guan Yu blocked, their clash rippling the air.

“Is this all, Young Master Wang?” Guan Yu taunted through gritted teeth.
