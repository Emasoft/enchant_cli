Guan Yu observed that everyone had handled the situation well here. The camels were all securely tethered with ropes, and as long as the felt tents remained anchored, everything should be perfectly fine.

Nodding in satisfaction, Guan Yu remarked, “This should hold. Our fellow disciples have done excellent work. Let’s head back.”

Siqi also felt reassured, convinced the arrangements would ensure safety. Just as the two turned to leave, a deafening thunderclap split the air, illuminating the dust-choked sky.

Within moments, torrential rain cascaded down, pounding the tents like falling stones. The relentless drumming echoed loudly.

“Oh no, the rain!” Guan Yu exclaimed, grabbing Siqi’s hand and dashing out. If they delayed any longer, the intensifying storm and howling winds would make retreat impossible.

After only two steps, their clothes were soaked through. Guan Yu frowned—he could endure this alone, but Siqi’s well-being worried him. If she caught a chill in this desolate place with no proper physicians, their journey would become arduous.

Amid the raging tempest, their own tent still lay far ahead. Making a split-second decision, Guan Yu veered toward Xiaomei’s tent—the closest shelter. Though Xiaomei and her sister were serpent spirits, sharing their space seemed preferable to huddling among camels.

Barging in with Siqi, they startled Xiaomei, who demanded, “What’s wrong with you? Lost your mind?”

“Apologies,” Guan Yu said sheepishly. “I went to check the camels, and the storm struck suddenly. We’ve come to take shelter. Hope you don’t mind.”

“Mind? Not really.” Xiaomei shrugged. “Though it’s usually just my sister and me here. Bringing your woman along kills the mood, you know.”

“I warned you about the weather,” she added. “Serves you right for getting drenched.”

Guan Yu sighed but turned to Siqi. “Are you alright? Not too cold?” He noted their shoulders and backs were damp, but they’d escaped worse by fleeing quickly.

“I’m fine,” Siqi replied, shivering. “But this storm… it’s terrifying.”

“Deserts are like this,” Xiaomei interjected. “Such violent storms aren’t rare here. You’ll get used to it.”

Guan Yu knew desert weather was mercurial—frequent storms and sandstorms arose from flat terrain and rapid temperature shifts. Outside, rain hammered the tent while winds roared. Siqi fretted the shelter might tear away, exposing them to the elements.

“First time encountering this since we entered the desert,” Guan Yu muttered. As he spoke, a loud *crack* made Siqi jump—something had snapped in the gale, though the tent remained intact.

Settling onto chairs, Guan Yu clasped Siqi’s hand. “Don’t worry. If the tent fails, we’ll use spells to shield ourselves.”

Peering through gaps in the fabric, they saw only gray chaos—rain flew sideways, lightning seared the sky, and thunderclaps deafened.

Meanwhile, Aze grew anxious. “Wang Jun, where are Guan Yu and Siqi? They’re not still out there, are they?”

“Only fools would linger in this deluge,” Wang Jun snapped, though concern tinged his voice. “They’re not idiots.”

“Should we search for them?” Aze pressed.

“No. They’ll manage. Guan Yu’s clever. We stay put and stay ready.” Wang Jun gripped his Iron Fan, while Aze brandished his Brush—both mid-tier magical artifacts that drew envious glances from fellow disciples clutching ordinary Yunqing Swords.

Most Yunqing Sect members only ever received these standard blades, making even mid-grade tools objects of desire. Outside the sect, quality artifacts were priceless rarities.

As the storm raged, disciples huddled in groups. Novices trembled—such fury was unheard of in their sheltered mountain sect. The desert’s vulnerability unnerved them.

Guan Yu’s treasures—the Imperial Seal and Soulfall Blade—could challenge even sect elders. Similarly, Siqi’s Jade Scepter, a gift from Guan Yu, outclassed former top disciple Yan Zhao’s abilities. Such power disparities fueled universal envy.

Aze and Wang Jun’s artifacts sparked whispered discussions: “That fan was a reward from the Sect Master himself!”

“For what merit? Even Yan Zhao never received such—”

“Who knows? But without the Master’s favor, how else would he get it?”

Wang Jun studied his fan, suspecting hidden secrets—perhaps a map to buried riches. To pass time, he asked Aze, “Which artifact is superior—your Brush or my Fan?”

“Compare their spiritual storage capacity,” Aze replied. All artifacts differed, graded by how much energy they could hold. High-tier ones were rare even among sects.

Wang Jun’s fan stored power in its gem pendant. “Haven’t filled it yet,” he admitted.

Nearby, Xiaomei watched Guan Yu and Siqi clinging together. “You two stick like glutinous rice cakes. Where’s the excitement?”

Siqi, still rattled, jumped at every thunderous blow against the tent. Xiaomei served tea. “Relax. Worrying won’t help.”

Guan Yu accepted a cup. “You’re calm enough to brew tea. We’re conserving energy for protective spells if needed.”

“Foolish,” Xiaomei retorted. “How long could your magic last? This storm might rage all night. Save your strength.”

Her words chilled Siqi. “Guan Yu, are we in danger?”

“Stay calm,” he soothed. “If Xiaomei isn’t worried, neither should we be. Storms pass.” Yet outside, the tempest showed no signs of relenting.
